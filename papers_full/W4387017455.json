Text anonymisation tries to \nprune and/or mask identifiable information from a text while keeping the remaining content intact to \nalleviate privacy concerns. Text anonymisation is especially important in industries like healthcare, \nlaw, as well as research, where sensitive and personal information is collected, processed, and \nexchanged under high legal and ethical standards. Although text anonymisation is widely adopted \nin practice, it continues to face considerable challenges. The most significant challenge is striking a \nbalance between removing information to protect individuals’ privacy while maintaining the text’s \nusability for future purposes. The question is whether these anonymisation methods sufficiently \nreduce the risk of re-identification, in which an individual can be identified based on the remaining \ninformation in the text. In this work, we challenge the effectiveness of these methods and how we \nperceive identifiers. We assess the efficacy of these methods against the elephant in the room, the \nuse of AI over big data. While most of the research is focused on identifying and removing personal \ninformation, there is limited discussion on whether the remaining information is sufficient to \ndeanonymise individuals and, more precisely, who can do it. To this end, we conduct an experiment \nusing GPT over anonymised texts of famous people to determine whether such trained networks can \ndeanonymise them. The latter allows us to revise these methods and introduce a novel methodology \nthat employs Large Language Models to improve the anonymity of texts.\nIn today’s data-driven society, the collection and use of personal information are becoming increasingly preva-\nlent. While this has numerous benefits, such as improved decision-making and better service provision, it also \nraises important ethical concerns related to privacy and confidentiality. Indeed, harvesting user data is a com -\nmon practice of far too many online platforms and services with a significant impact on citizens. This has been \none of the pillars that led to the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 1 and other \nrelevant legislation around the world as a means to address the privacy issues that emerged. The GDPR mandates \nusing privacy-preserving methods and processes throughout the data management lifecycle, from collection and \nprocessing to sharing and publishing. One of these fundamental methods is anonymisation. Given that modern \norganisations continuously deal with documents, the above has served as a catalyst in the emergence of text \nanonymisation as a research topic with many practical applications. The general concept is that given a text, one \nhas to remove or mask identifiable information while preserving the remaining content. Text anonymisation is \nparticularly relevant in healthcare, law, and research, where personal and sensitive information is overwhelming \nand must be protected to comply with privacy regulations and ethical guidelines.\nAlthough text anonymisation has been widely adopted in practice, it still faces significant challenges. These \nmethods must strike a balance between the need to protect the privacy of individuals and the need to preserve \nthe data utility. Let us consider this with an example where the anonymisation task is to anonymise the sentence \n“Volodymyr Zelenskyy is the president of Ukraine” . Clearly, simply removing the name is not enough. If one is \ngiven the sentence “ NAME is the president of Ukraine ” , it is trivial to recover the missing information. There-\nfore, the anonymised sentence would be “  NAME is the president ofCOUNTRY  ” . To this end, named entity \nOPEN\n1Department of Informatics, University of Piraeus, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou str, 18534 Piraeus, Greece. 2Management \nSystems Institute of Athena Research Centre, Marousi, Greece. 3Data Centric Services, Bucharest, Romania. 4These \nauthors contributed equally: Constantinos Patsakis and Nikolaos Lykousas. *email: kpatsak@unipi.gr\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:16026  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42977-3\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nrecognition methods are used to identify possible identifying information, such as names and locations, to mask \nthem. Let us go back to the example.\nWhile the sentence is anonymised, it is easy to understand that the anonymity of the masked person is \nbounded. Given that the sentence refers to a country’s president, there are 193 possible choices, which in terms \nof k-anonymity 2 would be perfect. Nevertheless, even fragments of information from other sentences in the \ncontext of a text could significantly limit the possible choices. Therefore, the challenge is not only whether an \nalgorithm finds clearly identifiable information but whether the remaining information is enough to deanonymise \nan individual and reveal the rest of the pruned information. For instance, using non-identifying information, \ne.g., referring to his acting career or studies, can limit the candidates to just a handful of people. Therefore, the \nchallenge comes down to how much information is available and whether this can be properly extracted to infer \nthe identity of individuals.\nIn the past two years, endless discussions have sparked with the introduction of GPT from OpenAI, which \nboomed with the introduction of ChatGPT. The GPT-3 model was trained on a text dataset of more than 8 mil-\nlion documents and over 10 billion words and is 175 billion parameters in size. This allows it to perform many \ntext-generative tasks efficiently, astonishing people worldwide. Based on the above, a natural research question \nis to ponder whether such systems, trained over texts with sensitive content that are available from one organisa-\ntion, would be able to deanonymise published anonymised texts from another organisation. Evidently, the latter \ncould have a catastrophic impact on individuals, despite applying best practices from the publishing organisation.\nWe performed a scoped experiment using GPT targeting famous individuals to assess this threat scenario. \nSince efficiently and effectively training such systems is by itself a challenge, we opted to use the available closed \nbut off-the-shelf GPT to deanonymise texts that had been anonymised by a state of the art algorithm, namely \n Textwash3. The choice of testing on deanonymising famous people is that this maximises the chances of GPT \nto have been trained on relevant documents and that, this way, we depend solely on public information. Then, \nwe use GPT to improve text anonymisation, increasing the actual anonymity of the texts without significantly \nimpacting their quality.\nThe rest of this work is structured as follows. The next section provides an overview of the current state of \nthe art. Then, in Section “ Threat scenario” , we detail our threat scenario. Section “Dataset and methodology” \nintroduces the dataset and our methodology. Next, Section “ Experimental results ” presents the results of our \nexperiments. Finally, the article concludes by discussing our findings and ideas for future work.\nRelated work\nIn the next paragraphs, we discuss personal data and identifiers. Then, we provide an overview of text anonymisa-\ntion algorithms. Finally, we describe two essential parts of our work, Textwash, an open-source text anonymisa-\ntion tool, and the GPT model.\nPersonal data\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) refers to any piece of information that can directly or indirectly identify \na specific individual. In this regard, direct identifiers can provide an explicit link to an individual and identify \nthem. In most cases, direct identifiers are unique values. Typical examples of direct identifiers are identity, \npassport, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers. The name is also a direct identifier, however, they are \nnot unique. Quasi-identifiers are attributes that do not uniquely identify individuals on their own; nevertheless, \nonce someone combines them with other quasi-identifiers or other data, they can narrow down the possible \nindividuals to the point of uniquely identifying the individual. Typical quasi-identifiers are birthday, gender, \nethnicity, postal code, and occupation. Some legal frameworks, such as the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States tried to define some quasi-identifiers in medical documents that \nhave to be removed to protect the privacy of individuals. Nevertheless, as outlined by Narayanan and Shmatikov \n“any attribute can be identifying in combination with others”4 so subsequent legislations do not directly refer to \nspecific identifiers and regulators acknowledge the challenges that data anonymisation faces, as well as its limita-\ntions and possible ephemeral  nature5.\nDue to the wide harvesting and exploitation of PII by organisations worldwide, data protection and privacy \nregulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California \nConsumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States\nAccording to the GDPR (Article 4), personal data are defined as  follows1:\n“Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data sub-\nject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by \nreference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or \nto one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social \nidentity of that natural person;\nTherefore, the GDPR considers that personal data are pieces of information that individually or with other infor-\nmation can be used to identify, contact, or locate an individual. As a result, personal data are widely described \nas Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Due to the sensitivity of the underlying data, data protection and \nprivacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union or the Cali-\nfornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States make specific provisions on the collection, handling, \nand management of such data. As a result, organisations must adopt appropriate data protection techniques, \nsuch as anonymisation, pseudonymisation, or encryption, subject to constraints on the type and volume of \ndata, user roles, and jurisdiction, to name a few. They should also follow the principles of data minimisation and \nprivacy by design, which means collecting and processing only the necessary data and incorporating privacy \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:16026  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42977-3\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nconsiderations from the outset of any project. Of specific interest is consent management, as organisations are \nobliged to have the direct and informed consent of the data subjects to collect and process their data. Neverthe-\nless, the aggregated and anonymised version of user data can be published without their consent, as theoretically, \nthe identifying information has been removed and individuals cannot be identified. Indeed, according to the \nGDPR: “This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for \nstatistical or research purposes”.\nData anonymisation methods\nTo anonymise data there are various methods that depend on the underlying information and how it would be \npublished. For instance, there are specific methods for tabular data which may greatly vary depending on whether \nan updated version of the dataset would have to be published again. Such methods may generalise or suppress \nrecords, introduce noise, slice the data etc.6. Nevertheless, such data are well-defined and have very specific and \nstructured information. Similarly, transactional and trajectory data may have to employ similar methods, e.g. \nnoise addition and generalisation, yet in different contexts to make the data reusable.\nHowever, for textual data, the approaches are radically different as information is not well structured, at least \nfor a machine. Therefore, the first step to applying a text anonymisation algorithm is to identify the structure of \nthe document that would allow one to trace potentially sensitive information and then prioritise these pieces \nof information, e.g., to purge the ones that seem more appropriate. Apparently, the above describes a natural \nlanguage processing task, and named entity recognition plays a central  role7–9.\nWhile mainly dictionary and pattern-based,  Scrub10 was the first such method and targeted the anonymisation \nof medical records. Neamatullah et al.11 followed the same path as their approach is also based on dictionaries, \nhowever, they use regular expressions and simple heuristics to locate possible sensitive information, includ-\ning doctor names and years of dates. Similarly, Ruch et al. 12 utilised semantic lexicon to anonymise medical \ndocuments. Dernoncourt et al.13 used a long short-term memory (LSTM) to anonymise patient notes that were \ntokenised text using the Stanford CoreNLP  tokeniser14. LSTMs alongside conditional random field (CRF) and \nregular expressions were also utilised  in15 to anonymise clinical notes. Sánchez et al. 16–18 leverage Information \nContent, disclosure risk, and knowledge bases to detect possible sensitive content in tokenised texts. Uzuner \net al.19 introduced Stat De-id which uses support vector machines to anonymise medical discharge summaries \nby assessing whether each word in the text is a sensitive feature.\nIn a parallel line of thought, Carrell et al.20 introduced the Hiding in plain sight (HIPS) method. Practically, \nthis method tries to conceal residual identifiers by introducing additional noise in the form of falsified informa-\ntion in the text to prevent the identification of individuals. To this end, the method replaces detected PIIs with \nfictitious, yet semantically similar surrogates. The principle behind this approach is that even if an adversary \nsuccessfully detects potential PII within the text, the task of differentiating genuine identifiers from falsified ones \nis obfuscated due to their random substitutions. This could mislead the adversary towards incorrect or non-\nexistent individuals, or result in contradictory information, effectively neutralizing a deanonymisation attack.\nFor more details, the interested reader may refer  to21–23.\nTextwash\nOne of the latest tools for text anonymisation is  Textwash3, an open-source tool introduced by Kleinberg et al., \nspecifically addressing the problem of privacy-preserving data sharing. The general concept of Textwash is to \nidentify sensitive and potentially sensitive information and redact it while maintaining semantic coherence to \nensure that the anonymised out remains usable for various downstream text analysis tasks. Textwash is based \non supervised machine learning, leveraging pre-trained contextualised word representations provided by a fine-\ntuned BERT language model. Much like the NER-based text anonymisation tools, the categories of redactable \ntext data considered by Textwash comprise a pre-defined set of 11 possible tags, the annotations provided by \ndomain experts. More precisely, the possible tags are PERSON_FIRSTNAME, PERSON_LASTNAME, OCCU-\nPATION, LOCATION, TIME, ORGANIZATION, DATE, ADDRESS, PHONE_NUMBER, EMAIL_ADDRESS, \nand OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE. The last tag comprises a meta-category which encapsulates the \npotentially sensitive information (PSI) concept. Concretely, the PSI notion captures the full spectrum of textual \ninformation that could reveal an identity which cannot be attributed to a well-defined category of PII. This is \nmade possible by leveraging the contextual awareness of its Transformer-based  architecture24–26.\nTo preserve the semantic properties of anonymised texts while removing any identifiable information, Textwash \nimplements a two-stage anonymisation process. Specifically, after a token is classified as one of the 11 possible \ncategories (e.g. John), it will be replaced with the relevant tag (e.g. PERSON_FIRSTNAME  ), with a numeric \nsuffix incremented for each different instance of the specific category. For instance, if in the document there is \nanother name, e.g. George, then each occurrence of John would be replaced by PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1  , and \neach occurrence of George would be replaced by PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 .\nGPT\nGPT-3 is a large language model (LLM)27 that relies on techniques such as tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, \nnamed entity recognition, and syntactic parsing to understand the structure and meaning of natural language \ntext. The underlying architecture of GPT-3 is based on the transformer  model28, which is highly effective for \nnatural language processing tasks. According to OpenAI, the training data for GPT-3 includes various sources \nsuch as books, articles, and websites, with a primary source being the Common Crawl ( https:// commo ncrawl. \norg/), a repository of web pages and documents that is regularly updated and maintained and its training process \n4\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:16026  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42977-3\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nis described  in29. Currently, GPT-3 is also used in various practical applications, including chatbots, with Chat-\nGPT being in the spotlight, language translation, and text completion.\nHowever, GPT-3 and other AI models also raise ethical concerns. There has been a growing body of research \non topics such as fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI to ensure that models are developed and \ndeployed in an ethical and transparent manner. For instance, given the increasing role of AI, negligence and \n liability30,31 must be reconsidered. The above concerns led Brundage et al. 32 to propose ways to ensure that AI \nmodels are developed and deployed ethically and transparently and the EU Commission to push towards the \ndevelopment of the AI  Act33, the first law on AI by a major regulator anywhere in the world, to mitigate pos-\nsible risks from the wrong use of AI and regulate its development and deployment in a well-defined legal and \nregulatory framework.\nThreat scenario\nCurrently, GitHub’s  Copilot34 uses OpenAI’s  Codex35 a descendant of GPT-3, as it is based both on a corpus \nfrom both physical language and code documents. Interestingly, Copilot was reportedly leaking secrets and only \nrecently did GitHub issue measures to stop it from doing  so36. The above means that LLMs can now efficiently \nunderstand sensitive information and its context. Therefore, we face the following threat. If an LLM is trained on \na large corpus of sensitive information, then it may have the capacity to deanonymise relevant anonymised texts. \nBy merely removing obviously sensitive parts, we cannot guarantee that the result would provide the privacy \nguarantees that we would expect. Due to the continuous increase in the quality and size of training datasets, \nas well as the sophistication to calibrate them, LLMs are managing to perform many tasks with high efficiency. \nTherefore, we must also consider them part of the attack tooling. Given the sear amount of data that modern \norganisations hold, it is only a matter of time until some of them try to feed this data to such systems. Going back \nto the Copilot use case, where secrets were leaked when one had to fill in a password, we can assume that these \nLLMs could fill in the gaps of missing information, including the case of anonymised texts.\nBased on the above, we consider the following threat scenario. Let there be two organisations A and B having \ntwo text datasets TA and TB , respectively. These sets refer to their clients, denoted as CA and CB , respectively \nand CA ∩ CB �= ∅ . The two organisations exchange information as a basis of their collaboration, but due to \nlegal and regulatory constraints; they anonymise them. Therefore, having in hand two anonymisation functions \nAnon1 and Anon2 (not necessarily the same), they send to each other Anon1(TA) and Anon2(TB ) . Setting aside \nthe legal and ethical constraints, A trains/fine-tunes (depending on its capacity) LLMA with TA . Our new threat \nscenario considers the exposure of CB from the use of LLMA on Anon2(TB ) that A receives from B . In what fol-\nlows, we consider that Anon2 is a black box; however, further tuning could be performed knowing how it works.\nDataset and methodology\nIn our experiments, we use the dataset  from3. More precisely, we use the data from the second study of Klein -\nberg et al., which contains 1080 descriptions of 20 famous individuals in the UK and their anonymised versions. \nKleinberg et al. assigned 200 participants to write a description of some random subset of these celebrities \nin English. As a result, for each individual, there are 46 to 61 descriptions, with an average of 54. Then, these \ndescriptions were anonymised by Textwash. The text in Table 1 is a sample anonymised text from this dataset. \nAfterwards, Kleinberg et al. recruited 222 participants to deanonymise ten random texts from this dataset and \nrecorded their success rate. By using this dataset, we refrain from processing any private information, as the \nwhole dataset consists of information about famous individuals such as Adele, David Beckham, and Luis Ham-\nilton, and the information is provided by individuals who have no relation to them. Therefore, the information \nis not sensitive, it is public, and the data subjects have chosen to make it public. Moreover, due to the fact that \nthey are celebrities, it is highly possible that GPT has already been trained on documents containing related \ninformation. Clearly, the relevant documents that might have been used for the training of GPT are different \nfrom those used in the dataset.\nUsing this dataset, we aim to assess whether the anonymised version can lead to the deanonymisation of \na document using an LLM. According to OpenAI, GPT-3 does not use online information; therefore, all its \nresponses are based on what the model has learned through its training. Indeed, OpenAI in its “ API data usage \npolicies”37 states:\nOpenAI will not use data submitted by customers via our API to train or improve our models, unless you \nexplicitly decide to share your data with us for this purpose.\nTable 1.  An anonymised version of the text for Mick Jagger in the dataset.\nPERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1  is an LOCATION_1  singer, songwriter, actor and film producer who was born on DATE_1 DATE_1  \nDATE_1  and is now NUMERIC_1  years old. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2  PERSON_LASTNAME_1  is the lead singer of rock band, ORGANIZATION_2  . \nPERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1  is known as a rock legend and for PRONOUN  charismatic stage presence and dancing. So much so, \nthat ORGANIZATION_1  released a song after PRONOUN  dancing, called OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 like PERSON_LASTNAME_1  ’.  \nPERSON_FIRSTNAME_2  PERSON_LASTNAME_3  has NUMERIC_4  children, and has had multiple partners, and NUMERIC_1  spouse. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2  \nPERSON_LASTNAME_1  has been with PRONOUN  current partner PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1  PERSON_LASTNAME_2  since DATE_2 .\n5\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:16026  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42977-3\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nTherefore, the information that we used in our experiments was not used to retrain the model.\nHaving the above dataset at hand, we created a set of tasks for GPT-3, asking it to guess the name of the person \nthat would fit most to each of the provided anonymised descriptions. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nThe results; discussed in the following section, led us to consider the revision of text anonymisation algo-\nrithms. We argue that the existence of LLMs and their ability to extract knowledge from large quantities of text, \nin conjunction with their zero-shot reasoning capacity, offer advanced features for text anonymisation. Therefore, \nwe consider a revised text anonymisation methodology, as illustrated in Fig.  2. Practically, an LLM is queried \nto report which pieces of identifying information should be pruned. Then, we remove these pieces of informa -\ntion from each text, leading to an improved anonymised version of the dataset. While some records could still \nbe identified, since the adversary would not have access to the same dataset to train the LLM, the risk exposure \nwould be significantly less than in our experiments.\nExperimental results\nIn what follows, we detail our two experiments and their results, illustrated in Fig. 3.\nDeanonymisation\nThe first experiment is a ‘motivated intruder’ test, focused on a zero-shot deanonymisation task. More concretely, \nwe perform two deanonymisation attacks. In the first one, we attempt to replicate the deanonymisation task \npresented  in3, but we modify the experiment by substituting Prolific Academic participants with an LLM. In the \nsecond attack, we try to attack the HIPS method by feeding the LLM with falsified documents but instructing \nit that some of this information is false. In this context, we used the 1080 anonymised descriptions of the 20 \ncelebrities and assigned GPT to guess the person this information refers to.\nDeanonymisation of suppressed PIIs\nTo reduce the noise in the input of the first attack, before submitting each text, we used a regular expression \nto remove any tags that were inserted by Textwash, e.g. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, PRONOUN, DATE, etc. \nSpecifically, we evaluated the most recent iteration of GPT-3 models provided by OpenAI, namely text-\ndavinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo, both being part of “GPT-3.5” series. At the time of writing, contrary \nto previous GPT versions, these recent models based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)38, \ndo not support fine-tuning using the OpenAI API. To establish which one of these pre-trained LLMs performed \nbest for this task, we randomly sampled 100 anonymised person descriptions from the dataset and tried differ -\nent prompts replicating the motivated intruder task of identifying the described person. In our trials, the latest \ngpt-3.5-turbo model consistently performed better than text-davinci-003, by a margin of 25-30%. \nMoreover, we observed that for the first model, syntactic differences in prompts describing the task had negligible \nimpact on the model’s accuracy. As such, henceforth we run every experiment using the gpt-3.5-turbo  \nmodel. The prompt template we used for this experiment is shown in Fig. 2a.\nIn total, GPT deanonymised 784 texts correctly, which is 72.6% of the total. Notably, the humans in the origi-\nnal experiments of Kleinberg et al. 3 deanonymised 285 texts, which is 26.39% of the total. Practically, using an \nLLM such as GPT the deanonymisation almost tripled since the correctly anonymised texts were 2.75 times the \nones that humans anonymised. As it can be observed in Fig. 4, the results are consistent. For every celebrity, GPT \nFigure 1.  Deanonymisation methodology.\nFigure 2.  Proposed anonymisation methodology.\n6\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:16026  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42977-3\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nclearly outperforms humans in the motivated intruder test. Notably, in terms of percentages, the closest result \nwas for D. Beckham (166% better), and the biggest difference was for D. Radcliffe (almost eight times better).\nBeyond the outstanding results in deanonymisation, of specific interest are the misclassifications, illustrated \nin Fig. 5a. On the left hand side with blue colour, we have the 20 celebrities from the original dataset, and on the \nright hand side and in red, we have all the recorded misclassifications. The most often misclassifications are of \nJ. Dench with M. Streep and D. Radcliffe with D. Craig. Nevertheless, for most of the misclassification, there are \nwell-justified arguments why these two celebrities could be mixed with each other. Of specific interest was that \nin our initial experiments, we noticed several misclassifications between JK Rowling and Sam Smith. Given that \nthey both belong to the dataset, the excellent performance of GPT in the task, and that the link between them is \nnot direct, we decided to inspect the relevant texts. Interestingly, we noticed that the dataset providers wrongly \nclassified eight texts in the dataset; they were attributed to JK Rowling while the text was actually describing \nSam Smith and vice  versa39. The latter perfectly exhibits the prevalence of the deanonymisation attack and the \nrisk from this attack vector.\nFinally, we asked GPT again for a second guess for the misclassified celebrities, and 77 more were correctly \nidentified, reaching a correct deanonymisation of 79.72%. Since there is no similar result for humans, we cannot \nhave a fair comparison. Y et, it illustrates that there is potential for further improvements as, e.g. confidence levels \nfor each response can be provided for each response.\nHide in plain sight\nIn this experiment, we aim to assess the effectiveness of the HIPS approach against LLMs, hypothesising that \nthe introduction of fabricated data would lead to a misdirection of the GPT and significantly reduce the risk of \npotential privacy breaches. To this end, we utilised the anonymised data from Textwash, which includes labels \nindicating the intended insertion points for surrogate PIIs, and employed  Faker40, to generate the relevant fabri-\ncated data corresponding to the tags identified by Textwash. For each tag in the text, we used the corresponding \nFaker provider to generate a suitable substitute (e.g., falsified first name, occupation, city, etc.). This surrogate \nvalue then replaces every instance of the detected tag within the text, respecting the instance suffix. The tags \nNUMERIC and PRONOUN are handled uniquely, with the former replaced by a random integer between 1 and \n10, and the latter uniformly replaced with a gender-neutral “they” . Moreover, given that the current dataset is \nabout celebrities and the PSI tagged by Textwash as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE usually refers to \nmovie/song titles etc., we replaced it with a random combination of a colour and a noun. Consequently, by the \nend of this operation, all potential personal identifiers within the original text have been replaced by fabricated \ncounterparts, see Fig. 6. Our approach is similar to the one described  in41.\nHaving the falsified dataset in hand, we initially asked GPT to infer which is the famous individual described, \nusing the same prompt as in our previous experiment (Table 2a). The model however was not able to identify any \nof the real celebrity targets referred to in the document, and it either replied with the surrogate names inserted, \nor with responses such as:\nFigure 3.  The data flow of the two experiments.\n7\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:16026  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42977-3\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n• “Unfortunately, the description provided appears to be entirely fictional. There is no celebrity who matches this \np r o fi l e .”,\n• “Sorry, but the description you provided has several inconsistencies and inaccuracies that make it impossible to \naccurately identify any real celebrities. The reported age of 10 years old, having 2 children, and being married \nat 10 years old are highly improbable. ”.\nThis demonstrates that although GPT could not identify real persons with the fabricated PIIs in place, given \nits reasoning capacity, it is still able to outline the inconsistencies born of the falsified insertions in the context \nof HIPS anonymisation. As such, given a sufficiently large corpus of documents, an adversary might feasibly \ndiscern that the data has been manipulated. To overcome this and elicit a response from the model with HIPS in \nplace, we had to formulate a different prompt, as shown in Table 2d. Quite remarkably, with the revised prompt \nthe LLM found the correct individual in the first attempt in 544 cases (50.37%) and in the second attempt in \n75 (69.44%) occasions. As in the previous experiment, we noticed several misclassifications and in Fig.  5b we \nillustrate those that appeared at least two times.\nAnonymisation\nIn the second experiment, we explore the extent to which GPT can effectively anonymise texts, as well as identify \nleakage of information that could lead to deanonymisation. First, we compare the GPT anonymisation efficacy \nto the one of Textwash. To this, we ask GPT to anonymise all 1080 of the original texts studied in the previous \nexperiment using the prompt of Table 2b, and for the produced outputs, we repeat the motivated intruder  test42. \nNote that we frame the text anonymisation as a zero-shot task without providing specific examples of what needs \nto be redacted in the original texts. An example of anonymised text produced by GPT is displayed in Table 3. We \nnote that the anonymised texts produced by GPT are more readable and semantically coherent than the ones \ntypically produced by anonymisation tools, as the redacted information is not just replaced by a tag, but the \nsurrounding text is rewritten to maintain continuity of meaning.\nIn total, GPT successfully deanonymised 738 texts (729 in the first attempt and 9 in the 2nd), resulting in a \ndeanonymisation rate of 68.3%, only 11.4% lower than what we observed for the texts anonymised with Textwash. \nAs such, we can assume that zero-shot anonymisation using LLMs, while slightly more successful than using a \nstate-of-the-art purpose-built anonymiser, cannot be considered an effective counter-measure mitigating the \nthreat scenario described in Section 3. Moreover, since the texts produced are largely altered compared to their \noriginals, it is difficult to directly compare with the outputs of Textwash and evaluate the capacity of GPT to \nidentify PII and sensitive words.\nTable 2.

An example of anonymised text produced by GPT.\nOriginal: Adele is a well known British singer and songwriter. She has won an amazing amount of recognition for her work including 15 grammy \nawards and 9 brit awards as well as academy awards and even a golden globe for Skyfall which was released in 2012 for the James Bond film by the \nsame name. Adele was born in London and went to school with the likes of Leona Lewis and Jessie J. Adele is very down to earth and connects to a \nlot of her fans on a personal level. She appears very kind and considerate of others and does a lot of charity work.\nAnonymised: A well-known singer and songwriter has achieved a great deal of recognition for their work, including multiple awards. They were \nborn in a certain city and attended school with other notable people. This individual is known for being down to earth and connecting to their fans \non a personal level, as well as being kind and considerate of others and doing charity work.\n8\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:16026  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42977-3\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nTo this end, we focus on the 784 texts that were successfully deanonymised in the first trial of the motivated \nintruder test, see previous section. We prompt GPT to report the most relevant excerpts in the original texts that \nprovide identifying information regarding the described person; see Table 2c. Note that we explicitly requested \nJSON-formatted output from GPT to facilitate the process of matching the exact excerpts in the original texts, \nas well as comparing them with the entities redacted by Textwash and their tags. Finally, we remove the returned \nexcerpts from the original texts and repeat the motivated intruder test.\nEvaluation\nIn total, 459 out of the 784 person descriptions were deanonymised (58.54%), which indicates that while text \nanonymisation can be substantially improved compared to the Textwash baseline (all of these texts were suc-\ncessfully deanonymised by GPT), there is still work that needs to be done to consider text anonymisation as an \nadequate mechanism for ensuring the privacy of text data in the era of LLMs. Next, to better understand the \ncapacity of GPT to find identifying information, we perform a series of comparisons with the output of Textwash \nfor the corresponding texts. To this end, we parse token by token the pairs of the original and anonymised by the \nTextwash texts and extract the tags of the redacted tokens, which we then compare with the ones returned by \nGPT to capture the subset of tokens returned by both methods and their categories. We plot the results in Fig. 7.\nInterestingly, the most prevalent tag returned by Textwash, PRONOUN, is largely absent from the GPT \noutput (2365 vs 59 instances, respectively). This means that -against human intuition- redacting the pronouns \nhas a negligible impact on the text anonymisation for an LLM. An exception to the latter is that GPT returned \nthe “they/them” pronouns, commonly used for non-binary individuals (see Table  4), which Textwash does \nnot capture. For the other categories, we observe that the tokens returned by GPT are aligned with the tokens \nredacted by Textwash to a large extent ( > 70% ), further highlighting the capacity of LLMs to capture sensitive \ninformation from text, even under a zero-shot setting without task-specific training.\nFigure 4.  Successfully deanonymised text per celebrity by GPT and humans.\n9\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:16026  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42977-3\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nNext, we measure the differences in text anonymisation based on the tokens that each method removed. We \nparticularly focus on the proportion of anonymised text identified by Kleinberg et al. as the only statistically \nsignificant variable correlated with the deanonymisation success in their motivated intruder test. Concretely, \nthis metric is calculated as\n, where ntok denotes the number of tokens in each text (original or anonymised). To this end, in Fig. 8, we plot \nthe cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of Panon(TW ) (Textwash) and Panon(GPT ) w.r.t the success our \nP anon = 1 − ntokoriginal− ntokanonymised\nntokoriginal\nFigure 5.

We observe that in both cases of successful and failed de-anonymisation, Panon(TW ) \nacts as an upper bound to Panon(GPT ) , meaning that GPT is consistently more efficient than Textwash in terms \nof the proportion of tokens per text identified as sensitive. Expectedly, for both methods, the Panon of the texts \nthat were successfully deanonymised by GPT is lower than the cases where the motivated intruder test failed. \nThe biggest difference is observed for Panon(GPT ) , around 5% between the instances of successful and unsuc-\ncessful de-anonymisation.\nThe superior performance of GPT to capture sensitive tokens motivated us to assess the impact on text \nanonymisation of the tokens exclusively returned by GPT compared to those captured by both methods. For this, \nwe calculate the fraction of tokens (per text) as follows. Let TTW denote the set of tokens redacted by Textwash \nand TGPT denote the set of sensitive tokens returned by GPT. Then, the fraction of identified tokens that are \nattributed to Textwash is:\nSimilarly, the fraction of tokens that are exclusively attributed to GPT is:\nWe plot the CDFs of these fractions for the texts w.r.t the success of the GPT-motivated intruder test in Fig. 9. We \nobserve that where the test failed (anonymisation was successful), F(GPT) is consistently higher than F(TW) , \nby a margin of 20% on average (for the cases where the identification test failed, on average the 59.5% of total \nsensitive tokens where exclusively identified by GPT, while Textwash captured the 40.5%). For the cases where \nthe test succeeded, the difference between F(GPT) and F(TW) is considerably lower, with average values of \n47.2% and 52.3% for Textwash and GPT, respectively. These observations further prove the capacity of GPT to \ncapture salient tokens encompassing sensitive information (PSI), surpassing even the results of state-of-the-art \nanonymisation tools like Textwash, specifically fine-tuned for this task. To better explore this, in Table  4, we \npresent the top terms lemmatised using  spaCy43 and bi-grams that GPT exclusively captured. Indeed, their \nmajority comprises specific features capable of revealing the identity of each individual, as well as false nega-\ntives for Textwash, such as surname. Similar tokens were also identified by Kleinberg et al. as being responsible \nfor the information leakage leading to successful deanonymisation (by humans). Nevertheless, we observe the \nexistence of terms that are rather generic but provided the context they appear in, their removal obstructs the \noverall understanding of a reader.\nComparison with existing work\nRecently, some researchers have started investigating the potential leakage of private sensitive information from \nlanguage models. Lehman et al.44 considered the case of BERT, leaking privacy data. The authors conclude that \nF(TW ) = |TTW |\n|TTW ∪ TGPT|\nF(GPT) = |TGPT \\ TTW |\n|TTW ∪ TGPT|\nFigure 8.  Proportion of text removed by each method for the cases where the motivated intruder test of person \nidentification succeeded or failed.\n12\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:16026  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42977-3\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nwhile some associations can be made, they are not enough to be considered a threat. Note that in one of their \nattacks, the names of patients were kept in the training samples, yet the associations did not significantly increase.\nBrown et al.45 acknowledge the potential risks of large language models leaking private information and there-\nfore highlight the need for training the models with data intended to be public and not simply publicly available \ndata. The latter is aligned with Zimmer’s  approach46, as people who may have published something do not make \nit public for every possible use and cannot be aware of the implications that it could have when correlated with \nother information. More importantly, Brown et al. stress that traditional and effective methods like differential \nprivacy do not apply to such language models. Undoubtedly, the closest work to ours is that of Lukas et al.47, who \nused GPT-2 on three datasets and successfully managed to extract PIIs from anonymised texts. Nevertheless, \nthe attacks refer to generic PIIs and not full deanonymisation, and their threat scenario is completely different \nto ours. Moreover, there is no actual comparison of what a human could achieve.\nBased on the above, we claim that our work is the first one to leverage LLMs to fully deanonymise a dataset \nof anonymised texts with such accuracy and illustrate the risks implied by the use of fine-tuned LLMs. Moreo -\nver, the comparison with human capacity as well as the identification of which pieces of information may lead \nto the deanonymisation of individuals has not been performed in the related literature. Finally, we should note \nthat using other prompts, the deanonymisation not only of the person but of all other redacted information is \nrevealed, see Table 5. As it can be observed, GPT, correctly replaced 20 redacted tags out of the total 23. Notably, \nthe three mistakes are one for the replacement of a pronoun with the name and the two advertised companies \nwhich in the original text were Vogue and Chanel. However, a simple web search shows that the result is correct \nas she has advertised the products of both Burberry and Lancôme. Therefore, the misses cannot be claimed as \nbeing wrong.\nThe latter implies that even when the deanonymisation might not have been successful, other PIIs could \nhave been extracted; however, they were not considered in this work and are left for future work. Therefore, a \ncomparison in terms of the percentage of extracted PIIs  to47 would clearly show that this approach is far more \nefficient. Indeed, our claims are justified can be justified by the misclassifications of Fig. 5a where one can observe \nobvious extraction of some PIIs (e.g., ethnicity, age group, gender) when the deanonymisation task failed.\nConclusions\nOur work puts more water to the mill in the discussion of the ethical use of AI. As common practice shows, \ncompanies will exploit the data that they have legally and ethically collected from their clients and the internet \nto infer more data for them. The reason is that this abundance of information can be used to personalise their \nproducts and services. As a result, they increase their quality, market penetration, and of course, their income. \nIn fact, many companies are already touting that they can enable such functionalities while the cost for creating \na trained GPT alternative, e.g.  BLOOM48 is in the scale of $7 million, and the cost is expected to significantly \n drop49. In this regard, we believe that it is only a matter of time before organisations start using LLMs on their \nFigure 9.

We argue that the above justifies the need to consider LLMs a significant threat in \nthe era of big data and artificial intelligence. Moreover, the results challenge what we perceive as identifying \ninformation as humans and what a machine does. While important for us features, e.g. pronouns are disregarded, \neven minor linguistic or knowledge hints can lead to complete deanonymisation.\nWhile we acknowledge that this threat might have always been in the back of the mind of several researchers \nwhen discussing privacy violations and possible abuse from artificial intelligence, the misuse of big data and \nbackground knowledge, this is the first work that practically illustrates this attack over anonymised texts. Indeed, \nthe comparison of the human capacity to anonymise celebrities by synthesising the information from relatively \nshort anonymised texts is by far exceeded by LLMs, even if they were not trained explicitly for this task. Thus, \none can safely assume that if the texts were longer, the results of the LLM would be significantly better as more \ncorrelations could be extracted. We argue that the above not only validates how realistic our threat scenario is \nbut also shows that the threat can be significantly augmented as visual data can be processed alongside  text50. The \nabove contrasts  to51, yet we attribute this change to the stronger association of the new models. Note that Huang \net al.51 attribute the results of the deanonymisation to memorisation due to the low association capabilities of the \nLLM they used. Y et, our results indicate far more advanced association capabilities and a significantly higher risk.\nTo this end, provided the efficacy of our adaptation of the HIPS algorithm to deceive the GPT, we believe that a \npromising direction toward effective text anonymisation in the era of LLMs would be to consider a setting where \nhard-to-detect yet misleading cues and strategical replacement of PIIs is introduced to steer the responses of \nLLMs away from the true identifiers in the case of deanonymisation attacks. This way, the privacy of individuals \nwould be effectively protected since LLM responses would appear valid, but would actually contain the falsified \ninformation that was intentionally inserted. Nevertheless, the above implies the need to develop new metrics \nthat are LLM oriented so that one can assess whether a document is more prone to deanonymisation than others \nand which parts of the texts are more sensitive than others. For instance, nouns have less impact on LLMs than \non humans and removing them significantly decreases the quality of the text. Thus, it might be wiser to leave \nthe nouns and focus on other parts of the text. Similarly, randomly faked data might be easily spotted by the \nLLM justifying the high deanonymisation percentage, however, context-aware methods could be more efficient. \nFor instance, rather than having random data, one could inject noise that could hint at another member of the \ndataset, making the adversary’s task even harder. Furthermore, generative AI could be used to interweave these \nerrors better in the text. Overall, we argue that LLMs will definitely play a central role in text anonymisation in \nthe forthcoming years resulting in many revisions in the field for both attacking and defending methods.\nData availability\nThe datasets analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable \nrequest.\nReceived: 22 March 2023; Accepted: 17 September 2023\nReferences\n 1.
