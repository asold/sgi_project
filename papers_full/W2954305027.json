It is a technique to facilitate\nformative assessment and to promote student learning. It has been shown to be more effective than traditional\nmethods. This phenomenological study was conducted to explore the advantages of gamification through the use\nof the Kahoot! platform for formative assessment in medical education.\nMethods: This study employed a phenomenological design. Five focus groups were conducted with medical students\nwho had participated in several Kahoot! sessions.\nResults: Thirty-six categories and nine sub-themes emerged from the focus group discussions. They were grouped\ninto three themes: attractive learning tool, learning guidance and source of motivation.\nConclusions: The results suggest that Kahoot! sessions motivate students to study, to determine the subject matter\nthat needs to be studied and to be aware of what they have learned. Thus, the platform is a promising tool for formative\nassessment in medical education.\nKeywords:Formative assessment, Kahoot!, Gamification, Medical students, Fun learning, Game-based learning\nBackground\nAssessment refers to a judgment about the performance\nof learners on the basis of specific weighted set goals [ 1].\nThere are two types of assessment: summative and forma-\ntive. Summative assessment occurs after instruction and\nrequires that judgments be made about the learning that\nhas occurred. Formative assessment is designed specific-\nally for providing feedback on performance to improve\nand to accelerate learning [ 1]. Formative assessment, the\nassessment of learning, is increasingly being emphasized\nin academia. It should be seen as an important element in\nthe facilitation of the learning process [ 3, 4]. Formative as-\nsessment is most effective when it is embedded in the\nteaching and learning activities to facilitate the provision\nof ongoing timely, specific and actionable feedback to\nlearners [ 2]. Therefore, formative assessment should be\ndesigned to improve students ’ understanding of the sub-\nject matter.\nFormative assessment can be performed in many ways,\nincluding paper-and-pencil tests or online quizzes [ 3].\nThe fourth industrial evolution has given rise to new\nmethods. Online platforms, such as Kahoot!, Quizziz,\nQuizlet and Socrative, that apply game-based learning\ntheories have become more common in education. The\nplatforms are widely used as formative assessment tools\nto promote student learning [ 4].\nStudies have demonstrated the benefits of game-based\nlearning over traditional methods [ 5, 6]. Game-based\nlearning has been shown to result in significantly im-\nproved student performance [ 6] because of the promo-\ntion of learning [ 7]. Game-based learning increases\nstudent motivation [ 6, 8], increases engagement [ 9, 10]\nand provides effective feedback [ 11].\nKahoot!, a real-time platform for game-based learning,\nis a free formative assessment tool that has been widely\nused in education.

BMC Medical Education          (2019) 19:230 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-019-1658-z\nthan 30 million users worldwide [ 12]. Kahoot! allows\nteachers to create four different types of game-based\nwhich are quizzes, surveys, jumbles and discussions in\nwhich the participants compete against one another.\nThe top scorers for each question are revealed, and the\noverall winner(s) is/are displayed on a scoreboard at the\nend of the session [ 13].\nAt the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) School of Med-\nical Sciences, formative assessment has been conducted\nvia the e-learning quiz platform eQuiz. The platform has\nbeen used to provide feedback to students. The use of\neQuiz is not compulsory, and the scores do not contribute\nto the summative assessments of the students. The data\nthat were previously captured by the learning manage-\nment system indicate that more than 50% of the students\ndid not participate in the formative assessment activities.\nTo overcome this issue, Kahoot! was introduced as an\nadditional formative assessment tool.\nIn the USM School of Medical Sciences, courses are\ngrouped into sequences. Two formative assessment ses-\nsions are allocated for each course. The questions to be\naccessed through Kahoot! are first constructed by the\nlecturers who are involved in the courses, which span\ndisciplines, such as anatomy, physiology and biochemis-\ntry. The questions are submitted to the course coordina-\ntors before being converted to the Kahoot! quiz format\n(Fig. 1). Approximately 120 – 150 students play the\nKahoot! ‘game’ in a typical session. The sessions are con-\nducted by the course coordinators, who are assisted by\nthe e-learning committee members. Each session com-\nprises 20 – 25 questions. The top three Kahoot! winners\nget special prizes and medals, and their photographs are\ndisplayed on a dedicated frame labelled ‘Kahoot!ers of\nthe Month ’ outside their lecture halls.\nA quantitative study was conducted to evaluate the\nstudents’ perceptions of a Kahoot! session [ 4]. Kahoot!\nwas found to motivate students and to make learning\nenjoyable. This qualitative study was conducted to gain\nan in-depth understanding of the influence of Kahoot!\non student learning. Therefore, the current study ad-\ndressed the benefits of using Kahoot! as a formative as-\nsessment tool in medical education.\nMethods\nResearch design, setting and sample\nThe current qualitative study employed a phenomeno-\nlogical design in which purposive sampling was used\n[5]. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted\nto explore the medical students ’ experiences in the\nKahoot! sessions in the USM School of Medical Sci-\nences. The participants were pre-clinical USM med-\nical students who had participated in at least three\nKahoot! sessions. Maximal variation sampling was\nperformed to select the participants on the basis of\nage, gender and ethnicity. The saturation concept was\nused to estimate the sample size [ 6]. The participants\nwere invited through a problem-based learning (PBL)\ngroup. They were briefed on the study background,\nprotocol and consent form. They were also informed\nthat their identities would be kept anonymous and\nthat they could withdraw from the study at any time.\nOnly the students who gave consent were enrolled in\nthe study. The times and locations of the FGDs were\narranged according to the students ’ convenience.\nData collection and analysis\nThe FGDs were conducted by researchers with expertise\nin qualitative methods. Bracketing was employed through-\nout the data collection and analysis [ 7]. To standardize the\ndata, a four-part interview protocol was developed. It\ncomprised the introduction, trigger questions, probing\nquestions and conclusion (Additional file 1:A p p e n d i xA ) .\nEach session began with an introduction that explained\nthe ground rules and the FGD process. The sessions began\nwith the open-ended statement: ‘In my experience, the\nKahoot! sessions are … .’ Researcher bracketing allowed the\nparticipants to describe their experiences without contam-\nination by the interviewer [ 7]. The FGDs were audio re-\ncorded and transcribed verbatim. Data collection was\nstopped once saturation was achieved [ 8]. Field notes\nwere taken during the interviews. Each FGD lasted\napproximately 30 – 45 min. After the first FGD was\nc o m p l e t e d ,t h ed a t aw e r ea n a l y s e db yt h eu s eo f\nATLAS.ti 7 software. The three steps in the proced-\nure were (i) managing the data, (ii) understanding the\ndata and (iii) interpreting the data.Fig. 1 Kahoot! session flow\nIsmail et al. BMC Medical Education          (2019) 19:230 Page 2 of 8\nManaging the data\nThe first step was the verbatim transcriptions of the\naudio recording of the interview. Each transcript was la-\nbelled with a specific code, e.g. FGD [ 1] 01/06/18. The ‘\n[1]’ indicates that this was the first FGD, and ‘01/06/18’\nrefers to the date of the interview (1st June 2018).\nUnderstanding the data\nEach sentence of the verbatim text was read very care-\nfully to discern the concepts, ideas and terminology that\nrelated to the research objectives. The relevant informa-\ntion was selected on the basis of the research objectives.\nAll of the researchers were involved in this step.\nInterpretation of the data\nThis step was executed simultaneously with the sec-\nond step. The data were coded by the use of thematic\nanalysis [ 9]. ATLAS.ti 7 software was used for this\nprocess [ 10]. From the verbatim texts, the initial\ncodes were generated; next were the categories, sub-\nthemes and themes. Thematic maps generated from\nthe software were reviewed to discern the relation-\nships among the themes. To ensure the credibility,\ntransferability, confirmabi lity and dependability of the\ndata, several measures were taken to enhance the val-\nidity of the findings. Table 1 summarizes the trust-\nworthiness criteria that were applied to ensure the\nrigour of the qualitative research findings [ 11].\nResults\nParticipants’ profiles\nA total of 36 students participated in five FGDs in which\nsaturation point was reached during the third session.\nHowever, the fourth and fifth FGDs were conducted to\nconfirm the saturation point was indeed reached. The\ncomplete demographic profiles of the participants are\npresented in Table 2.\nAdvantages of Kahoot!\nThirty-six categories and nine subthemes emerged from\nthe FGDs. The subthemes were grouped into three\nthemes: 1) attractive learning tool ,2 ) source of motiv-\nation and 3) learning guidance .\nTheme 1: attractive learning tool The participants per-\nceived Kahoot! as a user-friendly platform that makes\nlearning more enjoyable. They also indicated that it pro-\nmotes active learning (Table 3). The participants found\nKahoot! to be more mobile-friendly than eQuiz. In\naddition, they indicated that the Kahoot! sessions en-\ncouraged participation because of the rewards given to\nthe winners at the end of each session. Although partici-\npation was not compulsory, the students in the study, all\nof whom had used this formative assessment tool, stated\nthat ‘all students get involved ’ with the activity.\nThe participants mentioned that the gamification fea-\ntures in Kahoot! promoted fun learning. They perceived\nit ‘as a game, sort of entertainment ’ ([P21] FGD [ 3] 04/\n01/18). The platform was also perceived as challenging\nand capable of stimulating learning through the use of\naudio-visual stimuli. The students enjoyed the large\ngroup activities because they could compare their per-\nformance with that of their peers in real time.\nThe Kahoot! sessions were perceived as being different\nand more interesting than the quizzes in the e-learning\nportal. This finding was supported by the fact that the\nparticipants stated that Kahoot! was more interactive,\nthereby requiring the keener focus and active participa-\ntion of the students.\nTheme 2: source of motivation The participants con-\nsidered the Kahoot! sessions motivational (Table 4). The\nsessions promoted continual learning, review and deep\nlearning. After participating in multiple Kahoot! sessions,\nthe participants stated that the platform would help\nthem to improve their academic performance.

BMC Medical Education          (2019) 19:230 Page 4 of 8\nKahoot! sessions increased their motivation through\ncompetition, which increased their self-confidence and\nstimulated their participation in more sessions. Interest-\ningly, the failure to answer questions correctly was not\ndemotivating. One participant stated, ‘It will trigger you\nto work more ’([P15] FGD [ 1] 01/06/18) . The participants\nalso perceived the Kahoot! sessions as satisfying and\ngratifying: ‘When our names are displayed on the screen,\nwe feel very proud, especially when we are in the top\nthree. Our names are also displayed on the frame ’ (FGD\n[4] 03/02/18).\nTheme 3: learning guidance The participants believed\nthat the Kahoot! sessions provided learning guidance.\nThey stated that the Kahoot! sessions offered opportun-\nities for feedback, self-reflection and self-assessment.\nThe sessions helped them to increase their understand-\ning of the subject matter and prepare for examinations;\nthus, their studying was more focused (Table 5). The\nKahoot! platform was perceived as an effective tool for\nassessment and feedback. Furthermore, the sessions en-\ncouraged the students to study harder. A participant\nmentioned the ‘need to study more ’ ([P20] FGD [ 3]0 4 /\n01/18). The real-time response in Kahoot! made it inter-\nactive; thus, the students received instant feedback that\nallowed them to know which questions they had an-\nswered correctly.\nThe participants stated that the Kahoot! sessions pro-\nvided guidance on the content to be learned and that it en-\ncouraged self-reflection. The feature of displaying the top\nscorers in real time provided ‘benchmark peers ’,a n dt h i s\nhelped the low academic achievers to seek necessary sup-\nport from their peers and lecturers. The Kahoot! sessions\nalso tested their understanding of the material, thus help-\ning them to improve their academic performance.\nRegarding examination preparation, a unique feature\nof the platform is that besides giving correct answers,\nthe speed of response is also important for the students\nto score more points during Kahoot! sessions. The par-\nticipants mentioned that this feature trained them to\nthink fast not only for examinations but also for their\nlives as future medical practitioners. Early exposure to\nmultiple-choice questions (MCQs) and thus the examin-\nation was another advantage of the Kahoot! sessions.\nTable 5 Theme 3 – Learning guidance\nSubthemes Categories Quotations\nProvides feedback Insights into areas for\nimprovement\n‘It tells us, as an indicator, we are still not prepared [ on certain topics ].

BMC Medical Education          (2019) 19:230 Page 5 of 8\nThe students needed to prioritise the topics to be\nstudied. They indicated that after completing several\nKahoot! sessions, they had a clearer idea of the import-\nant topics to be studied in deep. A participant said, ‘We\ncan see which topics are important … which topics are\nless important ’([P21] FGD [ 3] 04/01/18).\nDiscussion\nGood formative assessments strengthen the students ’\ncapacity to regulate their own performance. Nicol and\nMacfarlane-Dick [ 12] identified seven principles of good\nfeedback practices. Good feedback practices 1) help to\ndefine good performance, 2) facilitate self-reflection; 3)\ndeliver high-quality information to students about their\nlearning, 4) encourage teacher and peer dialogue, 5) pro-\nmote positive motivational beliefs and self-esteem, 6)\nclose the gap between current and desired performance\nand 7) provide instructors with information that can be\nused to shape their teaching. Regarding formative assess-\nment, the study showed that the students perceived the\nKahoot! sessions as an effective feedback tool. It is an at-\ntractive learning tool that is a source of motivation and\nguidance for student learning.\nAttractive learning tool\nKahoot! was perceived as being more user-friendly than\neQuiz. This finding was similar to that of a previous pre-\nvious study [ 4]. The students can benefit from formative\nassessment by downloading the Kahoot! application,\nwhich is available free in the Play Store (for Google ’s An-\ndroid operating system) and the App Store (for Apple ’s\niOS operating system). They can participate in the ses-\nsions with just a single tap. In contrast, participation in\neQuiz involves more steps, such as browsing the e-\nlearning portal, logging in with their user names and\npasswords and searching for their courses. The multiple\nsteps might explain the students ’ preference for Kahoot!\nas a formative assessment tool.\nThis study shows that student engagement in forma-\ntive assessment was higher with Kahoot! than with\neQuiz. This was consistent with the previous findings\nthat fewer than 50% of students used eQuiz. After the\nchange to Kahoot!, more than 90% participated in the\nformative assessment activities. An effective tool for\ngamifying learning, Kahoot! possesses all seven elements\nof the persuasive architecture of gamification (Fig. 2;[\n[13]. It sets goals, offers challenges and provides feed-\nback. It also provides reinforcement, facilitates learners ’\ncomparisons of their own and their peers ’ progress,\nenables social connectivity and creates a fun learning en-\nvironment. Learning with Kahoot! was perceived as fun\nmainly because of the gamification features and the\naudio-visual stimuli. The platform was also perceived as\nproviding challenging activities, such as games for large\ngroups for which the results are available in real time. A\nKahoot! session is different from and more interesting\nthan an eQuiz session. Furthermore, Kahoot! ‘s inter-\nactive features promote active learning through in-\ncreased engagement.\nTrumpower and Sarwar [ 14] asserted that user-\nfriendliness is crucial for effective formative assessment.\nThe specificity and accuracy of a platform are of no value\nif the users (students and teachers) cannot understand\nhow to use it [ 15]. The current study has demonstrated\nthat Kahoot! is user-friendly; however, a strong internet\nconnection and the appropriate devices must be available\nbefore and during the session. For a session to be success-\nful, the faculty members should also be familiar with the\nplatform. However, Kahoot! has some limitations. It is\nsuitable for multiple-choice rather than essay questions.\nMedical training is considered to be intense and de-\nmanding; therefore, medical students are predisposed\nto psychological distress [ 16]. Previous studies have\nfound the worldwide prevalence of psychological dis-\ntress among medical students to be 21 – 56% [ 16]. A\nfun learning environment has been shown to reduce\npsychological distress [ 17]. In addition to having posi-\ntive effects on education, gamification creates a fun\nand entertaining environment [ 18]. The current study\nshows that the Kahoot! platform is effective at chan-\nging a stressful environment into a joyous one. This\nfinding is consistent with that of a previous quantita-\ntive study in which students perceived Kahoot! ses-\ns i o n sa sf u n[ 4]. However, institutions that wish to\nadopt Kahoot! for fun learning should note that the\nsessions should be properly planned to ensure that\nthe students achieve the intended outcomes and avoid\nFig. 2 Elements of persuasive architecture of gamification\nIsmail et al. BMC Medical Education          (2019) 19:230 Page 6 of 8\nthe excessive fun that could create disastrous teaching\nenvironment and lead to negative consequences [ 19].\nSources of motivation\nFormative assessment can have a significant effect on\nstudent motivation and achievement [ 20]i fi ti sd e -\nsigned to stimulate the extrinsic aspects of student\nmotivation [ 21]. Kahoot! has been shown to be an ex-\nternal factor in facilitating continual learning, which\ncould improve academic performance. Its competitive\nenvironment is key [ 22]. Another interesting aspect\nthat has been demonstrated in the current study is\nthe sense of satisfaction experienced by the students.\nThus, Kahoot! indirectly engenders positive feelings in\nstudents regarding their academic progress [ 23].\nLearning guidance\nAs has been demonstrated in this study, formative assess-\nment is most effective through the ‘catalytic effect’ of spe-\ncific and actionable feedback to learners [ 2]. The sessions\nencouraged the participants to reflect on their strengths\nand weaknesses. Furthermore, unlike other formative as-\nsessment approaches, Kahoot! allows teachers to provide\ninstant feedback. The session allows teachers to interact\nwith their students and to clarify material related to the\nquestions. In addition to facilitating teacher feedback, the\nsessions also promote self-assessment. An ‘assessment for\nlearning’ tool [ 24], the Kahoot! session indirectly prepares\nstudents for summative assessment by highlighting the\nimportant topics to be reviewed. In sum, Kahoot! sessions\nserve as an assessment of learning.\nOther advantges of Kahoot!\nKahoot! offers several other advantages. The platform: 1)\nis free; 2) uses multiple formats, i.e. quizzes, discussion\nquestions or surveys; 3) is user-friendly; 4) facilitates par-\nticipation through an automatically generated game pin;\n5) is compatible with smartphones, tablets and computers;\n6) has music and colourful illustrations that generate ex-\ncitement; and 7) has a flexible and adjustable response\ntime based on question complexity. In addition, instruc-\ntors can download, review and save the students ’ results\nto analyse student performance [ 4]. Therefore, it is recom-\nmended that medical schools use this free platform as a\nformative assessment tool to promote learning. Kahoot!\ncan be incorporated into teaching and learning sessions,\nsuch as lectures, tutorials and problem-based learning ac-\ntivities, for effective formative feedback.\nLimitations of the study\nThis qualitative study was conducted in a single institu-\ntion; therefore, caution should be observed in extending\nthe findings to other populations. The study found that\nstudents perceived Kahoot! as a useful tool for formative\nassessment. They indicated that participation in Kahoot!\nsessions can improve their academic performance. How-\never, further study is need to determine the effects of\nKahoot! on academic performance.\nConclusions\nKahoot! is an innovative formative assessment tool. This\nstudy suggests that Kahoot! sessions motivate students to\nstudy, focus on the important concepts and reflect on\nwhat they have learned. Therefore, this platform holds\npromise for facilitating formative assessment in medical\neducation. Health professions educators are therefore en-\ncouraged to incorporate Kahoot! into their teaching and\nlearning activities particularly for formative assessment.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Appendix A.
