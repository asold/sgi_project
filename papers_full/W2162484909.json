    "abstract": "This paper presents a new concept of 3D transformer structure realized by through silicon via (TSV) technology. A set of different turn ratio transformers have been designed and analyzed. The results show that the proposed 3D TSV transformer possesses good performance with small size. Finally, an AC to DC converter circuit which based on proposed transformer has been designed. The result demonstrates that proposed 3D TSV transformer is suitable for AC to DC converter design.",
