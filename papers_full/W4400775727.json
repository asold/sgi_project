    "abstract": "Importance Although augmenting large language models (LLMs) with knowledge bases may improve medical domain–specific performance, practical methods are needed for local implementation of LLMs that address privacy concerns and enhance accessibility for health care professionals. Objective To develop an accurate, cost-effective local implementation of an LLM to mitigate privacy concerns and support their practical deployment in health care settings. Design, Setting, and Participants ChatZOC (Sun Yat-Sen University Zhongshan Ophthalmology Center), a retrieval-augmented LLM framework, was developed by enhancing a baseline LLM with a comprehensive ophthalmic dataset and evaluation framework (CODE), which includes over 30 000 pieces of ophthalmic knowledge. This LLM was benchmarked against 10 representative LLMs, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo (OpenAI), across 300 clinical questions in ophthalmology. The evaluation, involving a panel of medical experts and biomedical researchers, focused on accuracy, utility, and safety. A double-masked approach was used to try to minimize bias assessment across all models. The study used a comprehensive knowledge base derived from ophthalmic clinical practice, without directly involving clinical patients. Exposures LLM response to clinical questions. Main Outcomes and Measures Accuracy, utility, and safety of LLMs in responding to clinical questions. Results The baseline model achieved a human ranking score of 0.48. The retrieval-augmented LLM had a score of 0.60, a difference of 0.12 (95% CI, 0.02-0.22; P = .02) from baseline and not different from GPT-4 with a score of 0.61 (difference = 0.01; 95% CI, −0.11 to 0.13; P = .89). For scientific consensus, the retrieval-augmented LLM was 84.0% compared with the baseline model of 46.5% (difference = 37.5%; 95% CI, 29.0%-46.0%; P &amp;amp;lt; .001) and not different from GPT-4 with a value of 79.2% (difference = 4.8%; 95% CI, −0.3% to 10.0%; P = .06). Conclusions and Relevance Results of this quality improvement study suggest that the integration of high-quality knowledge bases improved the LLM’s performance in medical domains. This study highlights the transformative potential of augmented LLMs in clinical practice by providing reliable, safe, and practical clinical information. Further research is needed to explore the broader application of such frameworks in the real world.",
