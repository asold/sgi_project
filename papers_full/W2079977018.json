Introduction\nThe authors have conducted experimental research with\nthe objective of developing cooling-insulation ﬂuid for trans-\nformers that is environment-friendly and high performance\nin ﬁre safety. The silicone liquid (20 mm2/s (20cSt) at 25◦C)\nwas selected beside 50cSt one. This selection depends on\nthe fact that Japanese Fire Service Law, which followed the\nAgenda 21 UN (1992), exempts substances with ﬂash point\nof 250\n◦C or higher from the category of dangerous sub-\nstances. And also 20cSt silicone liquid has high cooling\nperformance and low viscosity than 50cSt one’s, showing\nlower global environmental burdens, high economy perfor-\nmance, long term reliability, high ﬁre safety and other quali-\nties. Some topics on the performance of 20cSt silicone liquid\nwere reported\n(1)–(4) previously on its thermal degradation char-\nacteristics as an insulation material, its insulation character-\nistics, evaluation of its cooling performance, and its ﬂamma-\nbility characteristics as an insulation ﬂuid, and so forth.\nIn the present paper we report the ignitability and ignition\ntime at around critical radiant heat ﬂux, and the combustion\nproperties of insulation ﬂuids for transformers, so as to eval-\nuate their ﬁre safety. Regarding ignitability, we examined the\nrelation between ignition time and radiant heat ﬂux, assum-\ning the case where the insulation ﬂuid is subjected to high\nradiant heat ﬂux in the form of electrical sparks or similar\nheat source over a short duration. Further, we implemented a\nsimulation of the ignition time based on the thermophysical\nproperties speciﬁc to the insulation ﬂuids, and checked the\n∗Tokyo University of Science, Suwa\n5000-1, Toyohira, Chino 391-0292\n∗∗Japan AE Power Systems Corporation\n1-1-1, Kokubu-cho, Hitachi 316-8501\n∗∗∗Japan Specialist in Law Engineering Co., Ltd.\n3-8-10, Ima, Okayama 700-0975\nresults against the experimental ones. We also investigated\nthe peak heat release rate as of post-ignition characteristics\ndue to combustion within a speciﬁed duration using the cone\ncalorimeter in accordance with the IEC60695-8-3 (draft)(5)\ntest method.\n2. Properties of the Tested Insulation Fluids\nIn order to pursue the ﬁre resistant performance of insu-\nlation ﬂuids, we selected silicone liquid, mineral oil, and\nsynthetic ester oil as insulation ﬂuids of diﬀering proper-\nties which have been brought into practical use, and we con-\nducted combustion characteristics tests on them.\n2.1 Silicone Liquid Two types were used: one whose\nmain use to date has been in transformers for vehicle and/or\ntrain and that has kinematic viscosity of 50cSt (at 25◦C), and\nanother with lower viscosity of 20cSt (at 25◦C). The 20cSt\ntype had more homogenized molecular weight distribution\nthan that of 50cSt type, and had been rendered low viscosity\nby reducing its low molecular weight component resulting its\nﬂash point was 250\n◦C or higher. Figure 1 shows the repre-\nsentative structure of silicone liquid (polydimethylsiloxane(6)\nused for the experiments.\n2.2 Mineral Oil Mineral oil, categorized as Class 1\nFig. 1. Representative structural formula of silicone\nliquid\n࿦ Bɼ127ר7ɼ2007 ೥ 797\nTable 1. Some thermal properties of ﬂuids used in the\ntests\nNo.4 in the Japanese Industrial Standard JIS C 2320, which\nis derived from crude oil by hydroreﬁning followed by de-\nwaxing.\n2.3 Synthetic Ester Oil Synthesized generally from\na lipid acid and a polyalcohol.\nThe various properties of the insulation ﬂuids used in the\ntests are compiled in Table 1(4) (6)–(8).\n3. Evaluation on Fire Safety of Insulation Fluids\nNo quantitative evaluation methods have been determined\nfor the ﬁre safety of insulation ﬂuids, as they have been for\nsolid insulation materials. To begin the evaluation on the\nﬁre safety of insulation ﬂuids, it was necessary to have suf-\nﬁcient knowledge concerning the followings when they un-\ndergo heating: (1) the conditions that lead to ignition, and, if\nignition occurs, (2) the heat release rate (HRR) due to com-\nbustion and other combustion characteristics. Accordingly,\nin order to quantitatively determine the combustion behavior\nunder the prescribed radiant heat ﬂux, the post-combustion\ncharacteristics of heat release rate and smoke production rate\nand so forth, the cone calorimeter method (ISO 5660) was\nemployed.\n3.1 Method for Tests Using the Cone Calorimeter\nA general view of the cone calorimeter is shown in Fig. 2.\nBoth square and circular pans were used for combustion tests\nas are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). These pans were of stainless\nsteel with a thermocouple (K-type) on the bottom outside.\nThe volume of the ﬂuid used was approximately 50 cm\n3,i n\naccordance with IEC 60695-8-3 (draft).\nAn radiant heat ﬂux meter was placed at the level which\nis the same surface level of the test ﬂuids in advance, the\ntemperature of the cone heater was adjusted, to give the\ndesignated radiant heat ﬂux, and calibration curves for the\nheater temperature and the radiant heat ﬂux in the range 3 to\n50 kW/m\n2 were plotted. Next, the temperature of the cone\nheater was adjusted to give the set radiant heat ﬂux. After the\ntemperature had stabilized, the shielding plate between the\ncone heater and the sample was moved to give momentarily\nFig. 2. View of cone calorimeter\n(a) Square pan (b) Circular pan\n(100 mm×100 mm×15 mm) (Dia. φ110.27 mm×15 mm)\nFig. 3. Pans for ﬂuid burning test\nload to the sample with radiant heat ﬂuxes set at various lev-\nels.\nA maximum test duration of 1800 seconds was employed\ninstead of 1200 sec to pursue the ignition time given at the\ncritical radiant heat ﬂux. In other respects, the test method\nof ISO 5660, except the test duration of 1200 sec, was fol-\nlowed and gaved the followings data: ignition time, total heat\nrelease, heat release rate (HRR), weight loss rate, concentra-\ntions of O\n2,C Oa n dC O2, and optical smoke concentration.\n3.2 Combustion Properties Using the circular and\nsquare pans, each sample was loaded with 3 to 50 kW/m2 of\nradiant heat ﬂux, the time to ignition (tig) piloted with electric\nsparks was determined, and the combustion properties were\nmeasured and observed.\nFigure 4 is a set of photographs of the post-ignition burn-\ning states of (a) the 20cSt silicone liquid, (b) mineral oil, and\n(c) synthetic ester oil, respectively. The ﬂame height of the\nmineral oil was the highest, followed by one of the synthetic\nester oil, while the 20cSt silicone liquid had the lowest ﬂame\nheight. Also, as Fig. 4(b) shows, during combustion the min-\neral oil was observed to expand and overﬂow from the pan,\naccompanied by ﬂames. The color of the synthetic ester oil’s\nﬂame was whitish compared to the ﬂames of the mineral oil\nand silicone liquid.\nComparing the smoke emission of the samples, the silicone\nliquid and synthetic ester oil emitted white smoke, while the\nmineral oil emitted dark smoke tinged with blackness. In\nparticular, the silicone liquid emitted extremely dense white\nsmoke immediately before ﬁring, probably resulting from\ncombustible matter fumes that had vaporized, or from un-\ncombusted ﬂuid droplets. Also, when the silicone liquid\ncombusts, SiO\n2 crust forms on its surface, and which reduces\nthe combustion surface area as well as ﬂame height.\nThe mineral oil and synthetic ester oil, on the other\nhand, did not exhibit crust formation like the silicone liquid;\n798 IEEJ Trans.

Burning and ﬂaming behaviors of cooling-insulation liquids which were loaded of 50 kW/m2\nFig. 5. Time histories of the heat release rate of burn-\ning mineral oil, synthetic ester oil, and silicone liquid of\n20cSt and 50cSt\nrather, they continued combusting with ﬂames until they were\nburned up.\nHeat released was determined from the decrease in the\nmass of oxygen due to combustion of the ﬂuids, in accor-\ndance with the law of oxygen consumption. Figure 5 shows\nthe change over time in the heat release rate [kW/m\n2], un-\ndergo the radiant heat ﬂux of 50 kW/m2 for 1800 seconds.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 5 that whereas the peak heat re-\nlease rates of the mineral oil is highest, followed by the syn-\nthetic ester oil, and 20cSt and 50cSt silicone liquids were\nalmost same. The peak heat release rates of mineral oil, syn-\nthetic ester oil and 50cSt silicone liquid were 1.42, 0.77 and\n0.20 MW/m\n2 respectively, and the peak heat release rate of\nthe 20cSt silicone liquid showed almost the same extremely\nlow value of 0.23 MW/m\n2 as 50cSt one. Mineral oil and syn-\nthetic ester oil showed sustained their burning until they were\nconsumed due to burning out. Therefore, heat release rates\nbecame zero after about 300 seconds. By contrast, the 20cSt\nand 50cSt silicone liquids formed SiO\n2 crust and progressed\nsteadily to self-extinguishment, so that their heat release de-\ncreased gradually.\nFig. 6. Correlation between inverse square root of igni-\ntion time (tig) and radiant heat ﬂux to the samples’ surface\n3.3 Ignition Properties Immediately prior to igni-\ntion, no surface layer currents stemming from surface tension\ndiﬀerences, nor any apparent convection due to temperature\ndiﬀerence between upper and lower layers, was observed on\nthe surface of any of the sample oils, and almost no move-\nment was observed on their surfaces. The mineral oil and\nsynthetic ester oil gave their critical radiant heat ﬂux within\nthe ranges of 5.1 to 5.4 kW/m\n2, and 11.8 to 12.1 kW/m2,r e -\nspectively. The critical radiant heat ﬂux of 20cSt silicone\nliquid obtained lays in the range of 13 to 13.9 kW/m\n2,w h i c h\nis a little smaller than that of 50cSt silicone liquid of 16.5 to\n16.9 kW/m\n2. However, it is well known that cooling perfor-\nmance for transformer depends clearly on the kinetic viscos-\nity of the ﬂuid so that 20cSt silicone liquid is more applicable\nto transformers than 50cSt silicone liquid.\nFigure 6 shows the correlation, as derived from the above\nexperimental results, between the inverse square roots of the\nignition times and the radiant heat ﬂuxes which they were\nloaded to the samples. With each of ﬂuid, it was observed\nthat if the oil ignites after being subjected to radiant heat ﬂux\nfor a short time, (1) it exhibits a critical radiant heat ﬂux, (2)\nthe inverse square root of the ignition time is proportional to\n࿦ Bɼ127ר7ɼ2007 ೥ 799\nthe radiant heat ﬂux loaded, which means that the ﬂuid can\nbe treated as thermally thick material, and (2) with increase\nin the radiant heat ﬂux, the mineral oil exhibits the highest\nignitability, while the synthetic ester oil, and both 20cSt and\n50cSt silicone liquids show almost the same responsibility.\n4. Inference of Ignition Time from Properties\nIgnitability is one of the important indicators in consider-\ning the ﬁre resistant performance for use with transformers,\nand strongly depends on radiant heat ﬂux, density, speciﬁc\nheat, thermal conductivity, and ignition temperature. Accord-\ningly, in order to evaluate the ignitability of the ﬂuids, igni-\ntion times were simulated on the basis of the thermo-physical\nproperties for each ﬂuid, and compared them with the corre-\nspondence between radiant heat ﬂux and inverse square root\nof ignition time obtained from the cone calorimeter tests.\n4.1 Estimation of Ignition Times Figure 7 shows a\nmodel of the irradiating conditions. Radiant heat ﬂux from\nthe cone calorimeter heats up the surface of the ﬂuid, where\nit is re-radiated from the liquid’s surface into the ambient air,\nas well as being propagated through the liquid’s surface layer\nto the liquid’s interior. When the sample’s surface is heated in\na short time at a high energy density—in the form of electric\nspark(s) for example—the cooling of the surface layer por-\ntion by countercurrents will be secondary, and transmission\nof heat into the sample ﬂuid will go no further than the thin\nportions of the surface layer, so that the ﬂuid can be treated\nas a thermally thick material. Heat dissipation to the atmo-\nspheric outside air together with the rise in surface tempera-\nture should also be taken into account, but as forced air cool-\ning is not implemented, the air can be regarded as practically\nstatic. Thus, the model below is adopted.\nWhere the sample is subjected to radiant heat ﬂux from the\nexterior, then taking the surface x to equal 0, the boundary\ncondition at the sample ﬂuid’s surface will be given by:\nε·q\nrad =h ·(Ts −To) −λ∂T\n∂x\n⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\nx=0\n················ (1)\nand is rewritten as follows(7);\nT (x; t) −To\nε·qrad /h\n=erfc\n( x\n2 √at\n)\n−exp\n⎧⎪⎪\n⎨⎪⎪\n⎩\nh\nλ·x+\n(h\nλ\n)2\n·at\n⎫⎪⎪\n⎬⎪⎪\n⎭ erfc\n( x\n2 √at\n+h\nλ·\n√\nat\n)\n····················· (2)\nFig. 7.

(6). The thermal absorption\nrate, ε, was chosen the value which suits in an experiment\nwell within the range of 0.3 to 0.4. The ambient tempera-\nture was taken to be the room temperature during the experi-\nments. In the case of the ignition times estimated are equal to\nor longer than 1800 seconds, they were assumed inﬁnity, so\nthat the inverse square root of the ignition time gave as zero.\nFigure 8 shows estimated results based on Eq. (6) as the\ncorrelation between 1/√\ntig and radiant heat ﬂux, and those\nare compared with the measured ones from the experiments.\nThis ﬁgure shows the results obtained with the circular pan\nand with the square pan alongside each other. As can be\nseen, the calculated values and the measured values agree\nwell. Since the experiments assumed the case where elec-\ntric sparks are present, the values are for time to ignition via\nﬂashing, and therefore independent of the shape of the pan.\n4.3 Comparison of Ignition Times Comparing the\nignition properties of the typical cooling-insulation ﬂuids of\nmineral oil, silicone liquid and synthetic ester oil, one may\nremark (i) that the 20cSt and 50 cSt silicone liquid and syn-\nthetic ester oil have critical radiant heat ﬂux more than twice\n800 IEEJ Trans. PE, Vol.127, No.7, 2007\nCombustion Behaviors of Transformer Fluids using Cone-Calorimeter\nFig. 8. Simulated correlation between inverse square\nroot of ignition time (tig) and radiant heat ﬂux to the\nsamples\nas large as the mineral oil, and (ii) that in the case where\nthey ignite, the dependence of their ignition time on the ra-\ndiant heat ﬂux level—in other words their heat sensitivity or\nthermal inertia—is around four times larger. Hence, in evalu-\nating the ignitability of cooling-insulation ﬂuids subjected to\na high level of radiant heat ﬂux in a short duration, it can be\nconsidered possible, provided that the thermophysical prop-\nerty values of the ﬂuids are known, to estimate the critical\nradiant heat ﬂux, and evaluate the ignition time and radiant\nheat ﬂux dependence, without conducting ignition tests.\n5. Conclusions\n5.1 Summary of Experimental Results Following\nthe test method discribed in the IEC 60695-8-3 (draft),\nwe used the cone calorimeter to load samples of cooling-\ninsulation ﬂuid with particular radiant heat ﬂuxes for 1800\nseconds. By so doing we obtained the critical radiant heat\nﬂuxes, ﬂash points and heat release rates. Additionally we\ncompared such results with the ignition time predictions\nbased on the samples’ physical properties.\n( 1 ) Two types of pans, square and circular pans, were\nprepared to conﬁrm whether the thermal eﬀect would be ap-\npeared at corners due to thermal-boundary diﬀerence from\nsides, so that the experiments with a circular pan and with a\nsquare pan were conducted. We observed no signiﬁcant dif-\nference in ignition time or ignition temperature between the\ntwo types of pans. However, in terms of re-utilization, the\ncircular pan would seem to be easier to clean up and better\nable to give consistent experimental results.\n( 2 ) Based on the heat release rates for the post-ignition\nand successional combustion duration, it can be inferred that\nthe mineral oil and synthetic ester oil have each high peak\nin heat release rates, despite the short duration for which\ntheir combustion is sustained, and that such rate were main-\ntained until they burn up. On the contrary of these behav-\nior, the silicone liquids of 20cSt and 50cSt have quite low\npeaks of heat release rate and moreover they showed self-\nextinguishing properties. This self-extinguish property made\nthem excel the others in terms of ﬁre safety.\n( 3 ) From the relation between the ignition time (inverse\nsqure root of ignition time for each cooling-insulation ﬂuid)\nand the radiant heat ﬂux loaded, the usual approach method,\nthat is used often for the characterization on combustion of\nthermally thick solid material, can be applied. Simulation re-\nsults of the ignition time, when given the radiant heat ﬂux\nof the range of 5.5 to 50 kW/m\n2, based on thermo-physical\nproperty values of samples, was well coincident with experi-\nment values.\nWhile possessing insulation qualities and ﬂuidity, the\n20cSt and 50cSt silicone liquids have high ﬁre resistance\nand ignition resistance, together with a low heat release rate\nand self-extinguishing ability. Furthermore, in the environ-\nment they will be reduced via hydrolysis into its original\nconstituent substances, such as SiO\n2,H 2O, and CO2.F o r -\ntunately, this property can be evaluated not only as having\nhigh ﬁre safety but also as being excellent for environmental\npreservation.\nWe obtained almost the same high performance in ﬁre\nsafety and resistance to combustion and ignitability for both\n20cSt and 50cSt silicone liquids, so we could then select the\n20cSt silicone liquid for transformer based on its ﬂuidity per-\nformance due to low kinetic viscosity.\n5.2 Concepts for Evaluation Criteria Evaluating\nthe ﬁre safety of cooling-insulation ﬂuids requires the high\nperformances both on ignitability and on post-ignition com-\nbustion characteristics.\n( 1 ) For ignitability, the ignition response to radiant heat\nﬂux, or in other words the critical radiant heat ﬂux, is a valid\nindicator. The higher critical radiant heat ﬂux gives higher\nﬁre safety performance which give the resistance to ﬁre ﬂash-\ning.\nNaturally, the ﬂuids must have a ﬂash point that has to be\nhigher than the upper boundary for the dangerous substance\ncategory under the Fire Service Law (must have ﬂash point\nof 250\n◦C or higher).\nThermal inertia (λρc) is the item for judging the depen-\ndence of ignitability on radiant heat ﬂux. The thermal inertia\nof the cooling-insulation ﬂuid have to have the almost equal\nvalue to those of solid materials for electrical devices, i.e.\nepoxy resin.\n( 2 ) Indicators of appropriate combustion characteristics\nare: that the cooling-insulation ﬂuids have to have a low peak\nheat release rate and small total heat release. It is expected\nthat self-extinguishing, and less emits of smoke (and corro-\nsive gases).\nFinally, an additional criterion is the environment-friendliness\nin the wake of a ﬁre (it should not pollute the environment).\n(Manuscript received Aug. 28, 2006,\nrevised March 6, 2007)\nReferences\n( 1 ) A.
