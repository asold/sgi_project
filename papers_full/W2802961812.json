In WINGS INDIA 2018 held at Hyderabad, Airbus reported \nthat for the next 10 years India will be receiving  one Airbus aircraft every week[1][2][3].

INTRODUCTION \n \nAIRBUS has forecasted that  in between 2017 and 2036  the \nAsia-Pacific region will account for 41 percent of passenger \naircrafts above 100 seats and freighters over 10 tons that is  \n14,280 aircrafts , with  total demand of 34, 900 aircrafts  \naround the world [3] . In addition to it are already in -service \ncrafts and those which are joining the fleets around the \nworld from the long list of older order queues. \n \nMaintenance of such a large number of aircrafts to keep \nthem flying will be a huge challenge and automated  tools \nusing NLP can help a lot in such cases. NLP which is \nsupposed to fulfill the dream of translation of languages \nfrom one to another through machine translation can also \nhelp in Intelligent document search engines for product life \ncycle management, ta pping business policies and \nprocedures, including huge quantity of documents, are now \nbeing used heavily by both mechanics and engineer. \n \nTransfer of maintenance manuals from one language to \nanother (using Machine Translation) will help cut across \nlanguage barriers and engineers around the world speaking \ndifferent languages can easily understand and adapt to the \ndetails of technical maintenance manuals easily. \n \nIncident reports of pilots, controllers, Air Crew and \nPassengers can be collected and processed ( e.g. ASRS \nAviation Safety Report System of USA). Such systems can \nbe used for detail analysis thereby avoiding accidents and \nrepetition of such incidents. \n \nNLP tools are widely used in Aviation (maintenance, \nincident reporting, crew support etc). Research and surveys  \nare continuously being undertaken in order to improve \nexisting systems like moving away from traditional search \nmethodology results, such as binary answer (Is the specific \nkey word present? Yes or No), and which then leads to false \npositives ( the key word is present but in the wrong context) \nand false negatives (the right context but without the key \nword), to read and analyze detail flight reports. [4][5] \n \n2. NLP TOOLS USED IN AVIATION \nThe following are some NLP tools that are being developed \nor used in the field of Civil Aviation. \n \n2.1  TUAM AVIATION :  \nThe TAUM AVIATION project was undertaken in 1976, in \nCanada by the CETADOL research centre in computational \nlinguistics at University de Montreal (later renamed to \nTAUM). The a im of the project was  to create English to \nFrench Machine Translation system which could translate  \nmaintenance manuals of aircrafts. In 1979 A Prototypes was \ndeveloped which performed translation of maintenance and \nhydraulic manuals.  The TAUM AVIATION project was \ndone in the following environment; Hardware : CYBER 173 \nand Operating System : NOS/BE 1.4  \n \nDedicated dictionaries and  grammars were used which in  \nturn were compiled into an object code. This code was then \ncompared and transformed at run time considering the input \ntext. \nSaptarshi Paul et al, International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, 9 (2), March-April 2018, 109-114 \n© 2015-19, IJARCS All Rights Reserved                    110 \nThe source maintenance manuals were in English. The \ndictionary consisted of core vocabulary and had the \nfollowing data: 4054 unique entities and the English-French  \nBilingual dictionary consisted of 3280 unique entities. [6] \nThe Machine Translation that was used was fully automatic. \nInput of text was done in a photocomposition format which \nwas ready to be processed. Human intervention in pre-\nediting was not necessary.  whenever unidentified words \nwere encountered, these were entered after lookup in the \ndictionary. [6]  Unfortunately the Project was terminated \nbefore reaching a stage where a proper and detail assessment \ncould be made. \n \n2.2 IBM WATSON  \nIt is a NLP tool that uses NLP-MT and Cognitive computing \nin aviation.  IBM has worked in many aspects of a irline \ninformation processing . IBM with the wonderful  question-\nanswering capacity of Watson  and using Machine \nTranslation and  Natural Language Processing, help s pilots \ndeal with real time maintenance challenges. IBM has taken \nhelp of customer service agents, flight attendants, pilots and \ntechnical staff, to provide real time service to the aviation \nmaintenance and support .  \nQuestions put up to Watson in human spoken language are  \ncompletely intelligible to it. It can recommend suggestions \nin real time based on earlier occurrences. Neural Machine \ntranslation based on RNN helps WATSON in understanding \nscenarios and consider previous occurrences.  Machines \nsuch as Watson are real time systems used not only in LAW, \nMedicine but also in Aviation [7] \nLet us take a scenario : if an aircraft  suddenly develops a \nproblem w ith a hydraulic system , The pilot c an simply \ndescribe / speak the problem, that is in  natural human \nlanguage. The work of Watson is to interpret the p roblem \nfrom a logical viewpoint and then to consider  all the \nconcerned technical data pertaining  to a solution. It then \nmakes a series of recom mendations to the pilot on  how to \nmodify operation of the aircraf t to mitigate the pr oblem, on \nhow to t roubleshoot it, or an alternate or nearest airport to \ndivert to . Using Neural structure Watson will consider all \npossible options and recommend the optimal one. [7] \nSuch type of AI systems using NLP and MT are going to \nform the backbone o f incident mana gement and reporting \nsystem of the aviation world.  \nCourses are available at ( https://www.watson-\nacademy.info/course/index.php?categoryid=35) \nWhich introduces state-of-the-art natural language \nprocessing methods , with a focus on the technicalities \nrelated to IBM Deep Question Answering (Watson) system.  \n 2.3  AMRIT \n1Ansah is a company located in Sydney  which is trying to \nhelp mechanics easily use technical documents while \nworking on helicopters at  Airbus Group Australia Pacific \nusing a tool called AMRIT. \nAMRIT uses NLP to “READ”  1.2million documents or  \ndigital manuals of the following types :  \n          Table 1: Types of manuals for AMRIT \nTypes of Manuals Company \nmaintenance manuals  Airbus \ncomponent manuals  Airbus \nservice bulletins Airbus \nairworthiness directives Airbus \nfault-isolation manuals Airbus \nThe Idea is to make an Index related to various tasks by \nanalyzing sentences and grammar in the various above listed \nmanuals. using statistics it learns from previous successes \ninstances of solving problems.   once technicians confront \nsimilar problems the previously learnt instances are \nsuggested to the technicians \n AMRIT, requires proper training to be done depending on \nthe type of aircraft maintenance to be done. It  is a fully \ndeveloped product which is successful in the aviation \nmarket. To go through company’s policies and technical \nprocedures amounting millions of  documents it uses a \nsearch engine that searches document smartly .  AIRBUS \nwhich manufact ures both Fixed wing aircrafts  and \nhelicopters has used it  on one of its helicopter models  to \ndevelop fault is olation system.  Technicians mechanics, \ndevelopers MRO engineers now use it. [8] [9]  \nTo deal with huge amount of manuals and queries, help of \nmultiple servers are taken so that parallel processing can be \ndone to achieve the final product. \nHardware configuration is of a Linux server farm consisting \nof seven servers, which strictly follows  Airbus specified \ninfrastructure and configuration. [8][9] \n AMRIT in its next stage is being prepared  to take in  \nmanuals and documents for fixed-wing aircraft  and other \nrotor based models. Then training and tes ting are to be done \nin order to field it for real time testing. \n1Ansah’s support product of aircraft maintenance and others \nlike it have  prospects  that are limitless and after Airbus  \nprospective future clients of AMRIT includes  Engineering \nbranch of  Etihad  Airways, Singapore Airlines Engineering \nCo. ,MRO of Emirates  and Lufthansa MRO. \n \n2.4 BLUE  \n \nBoeing’s NLP system, BLUE ( Boeing Language \nUnderstanding Engine), consists of the following: 1. Parser \n, 2.logical form (LF)  generator,  3. initial logic generator, \nand 4.  processing modules. [10] \nTable 2: Stages of BLUE \n \n1 Parser has broad coverage and is domain general \n2 LF \ngenerator \ndeals with a large subset of linguistic \nphenomena, including simple sentences, \nprepositional phrases, compound nouns, \nordinal modifiers, proper nouns, some \nsimple types of coordination, adverbs, \nnegation, comparatives, and modals the \nlogical form generator \n3 Initial \nlogic \nGenerator \ninitial logic generator performs a \nstraightforward transformation of the LF \nto first-order logic syntax \n4 Processing processing modules then perform word \nSaptarshi Paul et al, International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, 9 (2), March-April 2018, 109-114 \n© 2015-19, IJARCS All Rights Reserved                    111 \nmodules sense disambiguation, semantic role \nlabeling, co-reference resolution, and \nsome limited metonymic and other \ntransformations \nBLUE, is able to generate representational st ructures for \nmany texts, using numerous linguistic aspects  while also \nmissing  a variety of others.   Each sentence of every \nparagraph are considered individually, and  each sentence is \nprocessed . BLUE has a pipelined architecture w ith multiple \ntransformation steps  through which it processes each \nsentence. Though BLUE produces a output that is good \nenough for controlled ar chitecture language , such as \ntechnical manuals , maintenance manuals etc., but in some \ncases human assistance may be required to find out the real \nmeaning of the sentence. [10]  \n2.5 “PLUS”  by SAFETY DATA and “ Partial \nAutomation of Aircraft Parts” by ATOS  \n2.5.1 PLUS \nSafety Data uses 'PLUS', which uses NLP  to read and \nanalyze flight reports. Traditional search methodology \ngenerally results in a binary answer (Is the specific key word \npresent? Yes or No), and therefore leads to false positives \n(the key word is present but in the wrong context) and false \nnegatives (the right context but without the key wo rd). NLP \nwhich is a part of AI, Linguistics and Computer Science  \nallows them to weigh a text (here flight reports) depe nding \non its likelihood of addressing the desired topic\n.[4] [5] \nThe PLUS Process can be summarized as follows:  \n \nTable 3: Stages of PLUS \n \nSTEPS ROLE \nDATA \nINTEGRATION \nPLUS’s mediation layer is completely \nprogrammable in order to filter and \nstandardize incoming data, which can \nadapt to any static or dynamic data \nsource. \n \nINVESTIGATE \n \nQueries coupled with logic help in \nsearching for similar occurrences.      \n \nNEW \nKNOWLEDGE \n \nHuman assistance and the ability of \nPLUS to learn allows it to add new \nknowledge and data related to the \nconcerned work. \n \nGENERATION \nof  WATCH \nREPORTS \n \nIncoming data is always watched and \nwatch-reports are created in real time. \nIt also helps in making suggestions and \ndecisions in risk handling and \nprioritization  \n \n2.5.2 : Automation of Aircraft Parts by AToS \nAToS, is an international information technology services \ncompany Serving a global client base, it delivers IT service, \nbased on Machine Learning has undertaken a project which \naims to partly automatize the design of aircraft par ts and use \nNLP applications in the process. \nThese techniques could bring about substantial \nimprovements in the aviation industry, from enhancing \nsafety to minimizing environmental impact. One of the \ndisadvantages of Neural and Statistical Machine Translation \nand other NLP systems are that  many of them suffer from \ndata deficit. They unconditionally depend on access to large \nand sufficient data to perform complex analyses and get  \nmeaningful r esults. In such cases  the quality of the input \ndetermines the quality of the output.  Fortunately now open \nsource projects  and Data sour ces have been thriving;  from \n3D printing to the peer -to-peer economy, many of the most \nrevolutionary inventions of the la st decade have been the \nresult of open -source collaborations. Indeed, the crowd -\nsourcing of data col lection in aviation has begun, with \nAutomatic Data Surveillance -  Broadcast data exchange \nwebsites and apps, such as the Flightradar24.com, \nradarbox24.com, planefinder.com, Open Sky network . The \nEuropean Union  encourages open data exchange and  \nassociated projects  and has involved sixteen airlines and Air \nNavigation Service providers  who share data with the aim \nto improve aviation safety. \n \n2.6 ASRS and ECCAIRS: \n In 2012 the probability of dying on a single flight on one of \nthe top 39 airlines was one in twenty million. air travel \nsafety is continuously improved. In 2012 ICAO (2013) \nreported 2012 as have had the least rate  of incidents and \naccidents (3.2 accidents for one million arrivals and \ndepartures) [11] In most of the cases, even w hen something \nserious occurs, example engine problems or Gear and \nhydraulics(front and rear) problems,  the accident i s avoided \nand the aircraft is able to land  safely. Equipments such as \nILS, ADS-B, Primary and secondary radar, training in \nSimulators and safety procedures  imposed all throughout \nhas contributed to safety . Air Transportation being a \ncomplex procedure requires efforts in all level to make it \nsafe. P rocedures in cident reporting improves safety of \nflying. \nNow moving on to reporting systems , although several  \nsystems exist at different levels for companies, governmen t \nagencies and NGOs, two of the most widely used are ASRS \n(a North-American database of incident reports ), and \nECCAIRS (European Coordination Centre for Accident and \nIncident Reporting Systems) a software system proposed by \nEurope for managing incident reports at different levels . \n[11] \n2.6.1 ASRS  \nThe oldest ( established in 1976) and most well known \nincident reporting system is known as ASRS which stands \nfor Aviation Safety Report ,  which is managed by NASA. It \nis responsible for collecting  reports of aviation events in the \nUnited States  . [11][12] Its information sources  contains \ndata for maintenance, policy developme nt, training . ASRS \n(https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/) has processed over a million \nSaptarshi Paul et al, International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, 9 (2), March-April 2018, 109-114 \n© 2015-19, IJARCS All Rights Reserved                    112 \nincident reports . ASRS receives reports from pilots, air \ntraffic controllers, cabin crew, dispatchers, maintenance \ntechnicians, ground personnel and others involv ed in \naviation operations.  reporting   to ASRS has been \nremarkable all throughout, with  400 reports per month. In \nrecent years, report intake has grown exponentially which  \naverages  to 1,769 reports per week and more than 7,664 \nreports per month.[12]  It has 4 types of forms to report into \n: \nTable 4 : Form types available in ASRS. \nForm type Used by \nGeneral Pilots, Dispatchers, Others \nAir Traffic control Air Traffic Controllers \nMaintenance Mechanics \nCabin Crew Cabin crew \n \nThis system targets s everal types of events from above \nmentioned sources . In general  a regular ASRS rep ort \nconsists of particular entity or narrative field  and attributes \nset. Each submitted report has multiple narrative fields \ncorresponding to the incident report . The descriptors gi ve \ndetail data about the time, wind speed, cloud cover, location, \ntype of aircraft and other instruments and parties involved. \nIn detail description of  the event with controlled values are \ncreated and are coded by the ASRS experts . [12] \nASRS products and services are as follows: \n \nTable 5: ASRS products and their corresponding roles [4] \nProducts and \nServices \n Role played \nAlert messages Safety information issued to organizations \nand possible corrective actions. \nQuick \nresponses \nRapid data analysis by ASRS Staff with \nimmediate operational importance. \nASRS \ndatabase \nPublic online database : available in DB \nreport sets and search requests. \nCall back Monthly newsletter available via website \nand email \nASRS direct \nline \nSafety topics published to meet the needs \nof operators and flight crew. \nFocused study \n/ Research \nStudies and research conducted on safety \ntopics in cooperation with aviation \norganizations \n \n \n2.6.2 ECCAIRS : \nECCAIRS (European Coordination Centre for Accident and \nIncident Reporting  Systems) standardize accident and \nincident data  collection and exchange within t he European \nUnion. ECCAIRS was d eveloped by the European \nCommission's Joint Research Center. Its  aim is to assist \nentities in  Europe to collect, share and analyze safety data \nand try to  improve safety in transportation. Its information  \nare free to be used by researchers and others . it is a software \nplatform using the following taxonomy of ICAOs \nAccident/incident Data Reporting and covers collection, and \nknowledge extraction of  incident reports. The European \nCoordination Centre for Accident and Incident Reporting \nSystems and the  Safety Recommendation Information \nSystem are based on the (ECF). ECF is a software  \ndeveloped by the J oint Research Centre of European \ncommission responsible to report and share accident and \nincident reports.  It is used by national agencies  of several \ncountries, including the  French DGAC. The reports \ncollected by DGAC are similar to those of ASRS, with the  \nnotable distinction of being written in several languages \n(French and English).[13] [14] \n \nCOMPARATIVE STUDY: \n \nGlobal Information Sharing Systems (GAIN) a part o f \nFLIGHT SAFETY FOUNDATION has initiated projects \nand developed products to reduce risk and improve aviation \nsafety worldwide. Some of its projects / studies include: \n “Safety Event Descriptor Codes International Standards \nDevelopment, Lessons Learned and Corrective Actions ” [4] \n“Sharing Systems for the Aviation Safety Community \nAutomated Airline Safety Information Sharing Systems”[4]\n . \nOf our interest is a survey “ Machine Translation of \nLanguage for Safety Information Sharing Systems”.[4] \n The capacity of MT tools relevant for  flight safety officers \nto share data in multiple languages  is viewed at.  Detail cost \ncomparisons and ICAO language comparisons are done in \nthis study [4]. \n \nThe Report goes through the various types of translation \nmethods like Direct, Indirect (Interlingua, transfer), \ncontrolled language, sublanguage systems etc. and \ntranslations demands such as Dissemination, Assimilation, \nand other methods. \nUltimately the report narrows down to Stand Alone machine \nand Server based Machine Translation systems and does a \ncomparative study of the MT systems/tools available in \nbetween different languages and the cost of each of them. \nThe report also go es through the disadvantage of both the \nServer based and Stand alone MT S/W’s. some of th e Stand \nalone MT S/W’s which could  be used for ICAO langua ges \nas of 2004 are listed in Table 6.  we see that there is a \ncoverage gap for six IACO languages (English, Fr ench, \nChinese, Arabic, Spanish, Russian) \n \nTable 6: Table for stand alone MT systems for ICAO \ncompatible languages \n \nMachine Translation  \nSoftware \nLanguage pairs/costs \nMLTS English-French (403 Euros) \nEnglish-Arabic (480 Euros) \nFrench-Arabic  (480 Euros) \nLogoMedia English-Spanish (163 Euros) \nTranSmart English-Finnish (329 Euros) \nHonYaku English-Japanese (797 Euros) \nSysTran French-Spanish(258 Euros) \nLogoVista French-Japanese(610 Euros) \nSpanish-Japanese(610Euros) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaptarshi Paul et al, International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, 9 (2), March-April 2018, 109-114 \n© 2015-19, IJARCS All Rights Reserved                    113 \nTable 7:Comparision of Server based and Stand Alone MT \ntools. \n \nIn this paper we have come across some NLP tools that is \nhelping various Aircraft manufacturers produce crafts faster \nand better and also some NLP tools that help us in \nstoringincident reports and help us to have a safer future for \naircrafts by helping to ide ntify the problems and how to \navoid the incidents and in turn accidents.

As of 2017 t he market for \nArtificial Intelligence,  NLP and Machine Translation  \ntogether in aviation market was USD 112.3 Million  and by \n2015 it may go up to USD 2,222.5 Million.[15] The NLP \ntools discussed in this paper and their likes are most likely \ngoing to form the backbone of NLP applications in Aviation \n(both Civil and Milita ry). While tools related to \nMaintenance and operational manuals has evolved from \ntranslating from French to English ( Tuam Aviation ) to \ngiving real time maintenance guidance (AMRIT), achieving \nreduced time frame, s till further research can be conducted \nnot only to increase the number of  documents, business \npolicies and procedures for various companies  in the Tool’s \nDatabases but also translation from English  / French to \nregional languages. \nTools like IBM WATSON are not only restricted to aviation \nand space b ut are also  being used in Health  and Law. The \ndevelopment of such NLP tools can also be extended to \nother sectors like tourism, medical tourism etc. \nResearch thrust may be given on Automatic Classification \nof r eports which is now increasing day by day. Such tools \ncan improve the usability of large databases of  maintenance, \npolicies and incident reports. \nOther research areas involve developing tools that will be \nable to display not only real time aircraft position but also \nlocal and global weather condition s and thus predict flight \npaths and expected turbulence. \nAirports, Aviation organizations issues NOTAM (Notice To \nAirmen) and Airlines issues  information over social media \nsuch as Twitter  / Facebook and alike on the condition of \nlocal weather and subsequent delay/rescheduling of flights \nwhich are readily available but  not in a centralized manner. \nThese information are generally not cross referenced which \nmay lead to misinformation. Such news feeds can be \nbrought together by NLP applications and predictions based \non facts can be displayed by future NLP based tools \nbenefiting travelers, ATC controllers and others. \nWith m ultiple MRO (Maintenance Repair and Overhaul ) \nunits coming up  in countries like India , Srilanka  , China , \nEngineers and technicians speaking local and diverse \nServer based MT tools Stand alone MT tools \nPrice is significantly higher \n(8000 Euros including after-\nsales service) compared to \nStand alone MT systems \nPrices range from 100 to \n800 Euros \nGenerally Licensed for \nspecific language pairs   \nSometimes licensed for \nmultiple language pairs \nContract for one to several \nyears (depending on \npackage) \nTools once bought can be \nused throughout. \nSoftware updates, \nTranslation-Engine updates, \nvocabulary updates available   \nNo such facility available \nCustomer can call for \ntechnical support \nNo technical support \navailable (In most cases) \nMultiple CPU support \navailable \nNo such support available. \nSaptarshi Paul et al, International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, 9 (2), March-April 2018, 109-114 \n© 2015-19, IJARCS All Rights Reserved                    114 \nlanguages are being emplo yed.
