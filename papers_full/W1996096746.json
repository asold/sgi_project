  "abstract": "Reflection is a powerful procedure that teachers can utilize to investigate, and make their teaching practices better. In order to reflect on the teaching and learning process, reflective teachers need some tools to obtain reliable data for reflection. The purpose of the study was to determine whether different reflective teaching tools obtained the same kind of data. If not, which tool provided the reflective teachers with more reliable data? In order to investigate the research question, a researcher-made questionnaire related to the teachers' decision making was designed. The population of the study consisted of all the Teachers (i.e., around 40 teachers) and students (i.e., around 800 students). The method of selecting the research sample was simple random sampling. The research sample included 10 teachers and 234 students. The design of the study was descriptive (non- experimental correlational). The ANOVA test showed that the F observed (4.27) was significant at the 0.05 level; therefore, there were significant differences among the kind of data that different reflective tools obtained. Moreover, further analysis emphasized that some reflective teaching tools provided the teachers with more reliable data.",
