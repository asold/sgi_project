Most, if not all, of the studies have focused \non subtractively made textures whereby the material is removed from the surface. This study investigates the performance \nof additively made surface structures whereby hard ceramic particles are dispersed in the form of dome shaped textures on \nthe surface of the cutting tools using solid state millisecond pulsed laser (pulsed laser implantation). Dry cutting tests were \nperformed on ductile cast iron. The results show a greater reduction of process forces with implantation of flank face as \ncompared to rake face. Both cutting and feed forces were reduced by 10% compared to the non-structured tool. In addition, \nthe tool life increased by a factor of 3 whereas the average flank wear reduced by as much as 80% and cutting edge rounding \nby up to 60%.\nKeywords Cutting tool · Surface texturing · Laser dispersing · Laser implantation · Surface structuring\n1 Introduction\nIn machining processes, the cutting tools are required to \npossess high surface hardness to slow down abrasive wear \nrate, good fracture toughness to avoid edge chipping and \ncracking, thermal stability at cutting temperatures as well \nas low chemical affinity with the work material. In addition, \nlow friction coefficient is required between the tool and the \nwork material to minimize resistance to material flow and \noverheating at the tool/chip and tool/workpiece interfaces \n[2, 4]. Thus, minimization of friction during cutting leads \nto greater tool life, improved surface quality, higher cutting \nspeeds and increased productivity. The industrial practice \nto improve tribological characteristics includes low-friction \ncoatings [5, 12, 13, 20, 23] and novel lubrication techniques \n[3, 29, 31, 36].\n1.1  Surface texturing by material removal\nSurface texturing has been shown to be an effective method \nfor improving the tribological behaviour under both full-\nfilm as well as boundary lubrication conditions for various \napplications [9 , 14]. Advances in ultrashort pulsed lasers \n(pulse duration times in pico- and femtosecond regions) \nhas led to numerous research studies on the effect of sur -\nface texturing of cutting tools on machining performance \nand tool life. Fatima et al. [10] produced grooves on both \nrake and flank face of uncoated carbide turning insert using \nfemtosecond laser for cutting AISI4140 steel with a lubri-\ncant. They reported a reduction of friction coefficient, cut-\nting force and feed force of 18%, 10% and 23% respectively. \nFatima et al. [11] also carried out tests with micro-grooves \non only the flank face of carbide tips and reported reduc-\ntion in process forces and cutting power of 12% and 37% \nThis project (HA Project No. 695/19-15) is funded in the \nframework of Hessen ModellProjekte, financed with funds of \nLOEWE – Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-\nökonomischer Exzellenz, Förderlinie 3: KMU-Verbundvorhaben \n(State Offensive for the Development of Scientific and Economic \nExcellence)\n * A.

Kröger \n j.kroeger@uni-kassel.de\n1 Department of Cutting and Joining Technology (tff), \nUniversity of Kassel, Kurt-Wolters-Str. 3, 34125 Kassel, \nGermany\n734 Production Engineering (2020) 14:733–742\n1 3\nrespectively. They also reported an 18% increase in tool life. \nThomas et al. [19] created dimples on high speed steel lathe \ntool and performed dry cutting of an aluminium alloy and \nmild steel. They reported a cutting force reduction of 41% \nfor aluminium and 20% for mild steel when using textured \ntools. In addition, cutting temperature was reduced by 3% \nand 13% for aluminium and mild steel, respectively.\nIn their study of turning aluminium alloy A5052 with \nmicro and nanotextured uncoated tungsten carbide tools \nunder minimum quantity lubrication, Kawasegi et al. [21] \ncreated grooves perpendicular and parallel to the main cut-\nting edge on rake face. They reported a greater change in \nfeed and thrust force as compared to the cutting force with \nmicro-grooves on the rake face. However, only a minor \nreduction of forces was observed with nano-textures com-\npared to micro-textures. In a similar study Kiyota et al. [22] \nused femtosecond laser to create dimples and grooves of \n20 \n/u1D707 m diameter (width) and 10  /u1D707 m depth on uncoated car -\nbide tools for dry orthogonal cutting of AISI1045 steel. They \nreport only a 10% reduction in forces and around 15% reduc-\ntion in coefficient of friction but only at speeds above 150 m/\nmin. It was also concluded that textures on the rake face lead \nto greater built up material which however causes reduction \nof tool/chip contact area. Enomoto et al. [7 , 8] performed \nmilling experiments with a tungsten carbide tool having \nnano-/micro-textures on the rake face. The nano-textures \ndid not improve wear characteristics whereas micro-stripe \ntextures significantly reduced crater-wear. The friction coef-\nficient was reduced by about 10%. The authors also CVD \ncoated the textured tools with TiAlN which further reduced \nwear and chip adhesion. Yamaguchi et al. [35] performed \npin-on-disc tests with electrical discharge textured steel disc \nto determine the effect of micro-textures under lubrication \nand reported a reduction of coefficient of friction of up to \n40%. Xing et al. [34] used nanosecond laser to create micro-\ntextures on the rake face and nano-textures on chamfer of the \ncarbide tool in turning experiments of hardened (50 HRC) \n1045 steel. They reported a reduction in cutting force of \nabout 15–20% and in radial thrust force of 30–35% and a \nreduction in cutting temperature of about 20%. However, the \nsurface roughness of the machined workpieces was higher \nfor the textured tools. Similar results were also reported by \nDenkena et al. [6] and Li et al. [24] for PcBN tools. In their \nrecent publication, Ahmed et al. [1 ] reported reductions of \n58%, 100% and 24% respectively for cutting force, axial \nforce and friction coefficient with femtosecond laser ablated \nsquare textures on the rake face of carbide tool when turning \nAISI304 stainless steel.\n1.2  Surface texturing by material addition\nOne common feature among the above mentioned studies \nis the use of the subtractive texturing methods whereby the \nmaterial is removed from the surface. On the other hand, \nadditive surface texturing, to the best of authors’ knowl-\nedge, has not been explored on cutting tools. Additive sur -\nface modification methods using lasers include laser clad-\nding, laser surface alloying and laser dispersion [18]. One of \nthe most recent developments in surface modification using \nlaser is the so called ‘pulsed laser implantation’ (hereafter \nabbreviated as PLI). A variant of laser dispersion, it com-\nbines the effect of surface texturing with optimization of \nsurface material. First developed by Steinhoff and Schulheit \net al. [26, 28] at the University of Kassel, Germany for wear \nreduction of cold forging tools, the process uses a pulsed \nlaser with longer pulse durations (millisecond range) on the \ntarget material covered with thin bed of hard ceramic pow -\nders. The energy transfers through the powder bed and melts \nthe substrate in small spots causing the ceramic particles to \ndisperse in the melt pool (see Fig. 1). The material added to \nthe melt forms dome-shaped dispersion hardened implants \nwhich are raised in relation to the substrate surface. Finally, \nthe remaining precoating is cleaned from the surface. The \ncontact surface to the workpiece is reduced to the wear-\nresistant implants, thus protecting the base material [16].\nThe properties such as dimension and hardness of these \nsurface structures can be specifically controlled by influenc-\ning variables such as the type of hard material, particle size \nand especially by varying the laser parameters. The control-\nlability and variety of the laser implantation process makes \nthe method attractive for applications with complex contours \nand tribological challenges. The process of PLI differs from \ntraditional coating processes in that it provides a harder and \nwear resistant surface in specific (dome shaped) textures \ninstead of a smooth continuous layer. This causes a reduc-\ntion in contact area at the chip/tool (rake face) and work -\npiece/tool (flank face) interfaces and thus helps to reduce \nfriction and heat generation. The resulting micro-dome is \na dispersion hardened material and not a uniform material \n(like a coating) and therefore lacks the hardness and thermal \nproperties of a coating. However, the presence of harder sur-\nface textures in relation to the base material helps improve \nFig. 1  Processing steps for laser implantation with the laser pulse \ndirected on to the workpiece with precoating of hard particles and \nbinder along with the melt and heat affected zones (left) and the \nresulting micro-dome with dispersed hard particles (right)\n735Production Engineering (2020) 14:733–742 \n1 3\nthe wear resistance and tribological performance. Hilgen-\nberg et al. [ 17] used TiB2 , TiC and WC particles for laser \nimplantation of X153CrMoV12 steel for cold rolling rolls. \nThey reported higher hardness of the implants at lower pulse \nintensities and onset of the keyhole effect at higher inten-\nsities. Maximum hardness values in the implanted zones \nfor \nTiB2 , TiC and WC particles were found to be 1600 HV \n(Vicker’s hardness), 1250 HV and 1100 HV respectively. \nSpranger et al. [27] reported a dispersion fraction of 40–55% \nfor \nTiB2 particles in the laser implanted zone and hardness \nvalues as high as 1800 HV. In their study of friction stir \nwelding pins implanted with boron carbide ( \nB4 C) particles, \nSchuedekopf et al. [25] reported an increase in the tool life \nof up to 70%.\nThis novel surface texturing method offers a promising \nperspective especially for high speed steel (HSS) special \ntools such as band saws or hobs, where an economical coat-\ning is often not possible. In addition, there are potentials for \nenergy saving through friction reduction due to the positive \ntribological properties of the implants [35]. Therefore, it is \nthe aim of this paper to investigate the effect of PLI of hard \nparticles on the performance of HSS tools in dry orthogo -\nnal cutting experiments. PLI of cutting tools is primarily \nintented for reducing wear of the tools in roughing opera-\ntions. The laser implanted structures, specially on the flank \nface, would result in smaller but multiple contacts resulting \nin higher surface roughness than non-implanted tools and \ntherefore not suitable for finishing operations.\n2  Materials and methods\nFor this investigation HSS type DIN HS6-5-2-10 (C: 0.85%; \nW: 6.5%; Mo: 5%; V: 2%; Co: 10%) was used as the tool \nmaterial. The hardness of the material in as delivered state \nwas 1060 HV (67 HRC). The tool geometry, shown in Fig. 2, \nwas wire-eroded and ground to a form similar to a saw tip. \nThe tool had a width of 1.8 mm and +5\n◦ rake and relief \nangles. The rake and flank face were both ground to a sur -\nface roughness Rz 3 /u1D707 m and a cutting edge radius of 10 /u1D707 m. \nSurface roughness was measured using optical profilometer \nof manufacturer FRT GmbH and the edge radius was meas-\nured using light fringe projection profilometer of manufac-\nturer LMI Technologies The side relief angle was not ground \non the tool.\n2.1  Laser implantation\nPulsed laser implantation was performed using an Nd:YAG \npulsed fiber laser of type LASAG KLS-246-C having a \nwavelength of 1064 nm, pulse duration 0.1–20 ms, pulse \nfrequency 0.1–500 Hz, average pulse power 10–220 W, peak \npower 5,5 kW and peak energy 50 J. The parameter study for \nlaser implantation was performed on flat samples of HS6-\n5-2-10 having a thickness of 3 mm. Tungsten carbide (WC) \nparticles were used for pulsed laser implantation. The physi-\ncal properties of the powder are given in Table 1.\nThe precoat of hard particles was applied as a slurry \ncontaining 75 wt% hard particles, 20 wt% organic binder \n(polyvinyl butyral (PVB)) and 5 wt% ethanol using an \nair-brush gun. Three precoat thicknesses were applied i.e. \n75 \n/u1D707 m, 150 /u1D707 m and 300  /u1D707 m. The thickness of the precoat \nwas measured non-destructively using a callibrated eddy \ncurrent sensor. The precoated samples were allowed to dry \nand harden at room temperature for 24 h after which the pre-\ncoat was ready for laser implantation. After precoating with \ndifferent thicknesses, PLI was performed by varying pulse \npower Pp, pulse length tp as well as distance from focus \n/u1D6E5 f \n(see Table  2). The focus distance has an influence on the \nspot diameter and thus also on the area intensity of the laser \nFig. 2  High speed steel tool geometry used in the cutting tests\nTable 1  Properties of WC particles at 20 ◦ C used for pulsed laser \nimplantation [15]\nProperty Value\nHardness 2400 HV1\nParticle size 1 /u1D707m\nMelting point 2780 ◦C\nElasticity module 550 GPa\nThermal expansion coefficient 4.9 x 10−6 K −1\nDensity 15.8 g/cm3\nThermal conductivity 117 Wm−1K−1\nTable 2  Experimental plan for parameter study of laser implantation \nof flat HSS samples with variation of precoat thickness, pulse length, \ndistance from focus and average laser power\nFactors Levels\nPrecoat thickness [ /u1D707m] 75; 150; 300\nAverage laser power [W] 50; 100; 150\nPulse duration [ms] 1; 2; 3; 4; 5\nDistance from focus [mm] 0; 1\n736 Production Engineering (2020) 14:733–742\n1 3\nbeam and is set to /u1D6E5 f = 0 mm and 1 mm. A positive value \nof the focus position means that the focus point is above the \nsubstrate surface, a negative value means that the focus is \nbelow the surface.\nFor each parameter combination a single sample with 23 \nspots placed 500 \n/u1D707 m away from each other and with a 50 /u1D707 m \noffset between adjacent rows of spots was prepared. The off-\nset increases the probability of cutting through the middle of \nthe implant for microscopy and hardness measurements. For \nthe identification of optimal parameters, the penetration of \nthe implant zones, the shape of the domes, the height above \nthe substrate, diameter of the spots as well as the micro-\nstructural defects such as pores, micro-cracks and keyhole \neffect were used as the selection criterions. From a detailed \nparameter study, which is not the subject of this paper, the \nparameter combination given in Table  3 was selected. The \nlaser implantation of HSS samples with selected parameters \nresult in an average spot diameter of 200 \n/u1D707 m and height of \nthe domes above the surface of about 20 /u1D707 m. Figure 3 shows \nthe melt zone as well as the heat affected zone (HAZ) in the \ncross section of the implanted region. The HAZ appears to \nbe less than \n100μm  which is 400μm  less than the distance \nbetween each spot (distance between closest edges). There-\nfore, the residual heating effect from one spot to the next \ncould be neglected.\nFor the microhardness measurement in the cross-section \nof the implantation, a total of nine spots were created on a \nflat high speed steel sample. After implantation the sample \nwas then wire eroded such that multiple implantation spots \nare cut through the center. The cross-sections were then \nembedded in epoxy resin, ground, polished and etched with \n5 % Nital solution for 30 seconds to enhance the microstruc-\ntures. Cross-sections of the three of the nine implantation \nspots are shown in Fig. 3a. The hardness was then measured \nin five regions in the cross section using Micro Vickers test \napparatus with 0.1 kg load (see Fig. 3b). Bright appearance \nof the region 1 indicate a higher dispersion of WC particles \nand a hardness increase of about 20 % compared to the base \nmaterial was observed for this region (see Fig.  3c). This is \nalso where the highest hardness is desired to resist abra-\nsive wear. In the dark appearing core area (region 2) the \ndispersion is less, so that a lower hardness was observed. \nThe heat-affected region (region 3) and the transition region \n(region 4) were also hardened with respect to the base mate-\nrial (region 5). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and \nEnergy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX) were not avail-\nable for this study. However, implantation with tungsten \ncarbide particles of \n10μm  average size was performed at \nthe tff institute of the university of Kassel by [ 32] for fric-\ntion stir welding tool made of tool steel 1.2343 and SEM / \nEDX analysis was performed. Figure 4 shows the backscat-\ntered electron image and the EDX analysis of distribution of \ntungsten (W) in the implanted region. The precoating thick-\nness hereby was also \n150μm  , average pulse power 80 W \nand pulse duration was 5 ms. The EDX analysis shows that \nsimilar to the observation in Fig.  3, two distinct regions in \nTable 3  Selected parameters for \nlaser implantation Parameter Value\nCoat thickness 150 /u1D707m\nPulse power 100 W\nPulse duration 4 ms\nFocus distance 0 mm\nFocus radius 88 /u1D707m\nPulse energy 437 mJ\nLaser intensity 450 kW/cm2\nFig. 3  Micro-hardness measurement of the implanted spots (N = 9)\n737Production Engineering (2020) 14:733–742 \n1 3\nthe implanted zones are present. The upper portion contains \naround 30–40% WC particles by volume while the lower \nregion about 15%. The EDX results also show that some \nof the WC particles melt and are finely distributed in the \nmatrix.\n2.2  Orthogonal cutting tests\nAfter the selection of the optimum parameter combination, \nPLI of the HSS cutting tool (see Fig.  2) was performed. \nFour variations of the tool were evaluated including a non-\nimplanted tool (shown in Fig. 2b), tool with implanted rake \nface (SF), implanted flank face (FF) and one variant where \nboth rake and flank face were implanted (SF+FF) with tung-\nsten carbide particles (see Fig. 5). For all implanted variants, \nPLI was performed in a 6 x 6 spot raster with each spot hav-\ning a diameter of approximately 200 \n/u1D707 m and a protrusion \nabove the surface of about 20 /u1D707 m. The outer edge of the first \nrow of implants (closest to the main cutting edge) being at a \ndistance of 100 \n/u1D707 m from the edge.\nThe workpiece material for the cutting tests was a sphe-\nroidal graphite cast iron EN-GJS-800-2. The material con-\ntains spheroidal shaped graphite inside ferritic zones in a \npearlite matrix; a tensile strength of 800 MPa, an elonga-\ntion at failure of 2% and Rockwell hardness of 38 HRc. The \ninherent lubrication property (due to graphite) of the mate-\nrial helps to avoid built-up edge (BuE) during dry cutting. \nCutting tests were performed on a linear cutting rig designed \nto simulate the cutting action of a bandsaw with a single \ntooth (see Fig. 6). Forces in three directions were measured \nusing Kistler 9257b dynamometer. For the determination \nof the cutting parameters, cutting tests with non-implanted \n(ground) tool were performed with the goal of minimizing \nthe BuE. Based on these tests, a cutting speed ( \nvc ) of 50 m/\nmin and tooth feed ( fz ) of 0.02 mm was selected for further \ntests.\nThe cutting tests were performed in two stages. First, \ncutting tests were performed with the four tool variations \ni.e. the non-implanted tool and the three variations of laser \nimplanted tools shown in Fig.  5 to determine the variant \nproducing greatest reduction in process forces compared to \nvariant 1 (non-implanted tool). For this purpose, two 2 mm \ndeep grooves with three samples of each variant were cut \ninto the workpiece plate representing 200 cuts each being \n300 mm long and having approximately 3 snds of non-cut-\nting motion between each cut or 60 m total length of cut. \nIn the second part of the cutting tests, longer experiments \nwere performed with the selected variant of the implanted \ntool and the non-implanted tool to assess the effect of PLI \non the tool life. For the comparison of tool wear between the \nnon- implanted and implanted tools, three wear forms were \nmeasured namely the nose radius, wear of the main flank \nface and side flank. Wear limit for the tool life was set as \n0.2 mm for flank wear land. Wear on the tool was measured \nunder Leica Z16 macroscope after every 1000 cutting cycles \nrepresenting a cut surface area of 60 cm\n2 . Three repetitions \nwere performed for each of the variants in both first and \nsecond phase of the cutting tests.\nFig. 4  Distribution of tungsten in the laser implanted zone on tool \nsteel 1.2343 using tungsten carbide particles [32]\nFig. 5  Three variants of laser implanted tools used for orthogonal \ncutting tests. FF: Flank face implantation; SF: Rake face implanta-\ntion; SF+FF: Rake + flank face implantation\n Fig. 6  Test apparatus for orthogonal cutting tests\n738 Production Engineering (2020) 14:733–742\n1 3\n3  Results and discussion\nFigure 7 shows the average cutting and feed forces from 200 \ncuts (amounting to a total length of cut L = 60 m) made with \nthree samples of each of the four tool variants. The effect \nof tool wear for the first 60 m of cut is negligible (around \n10 /u1D707 m) as seen in the plot of flank wear land width (  Vb ) \nagainst length of cut in Fig.  12. Compared to the non-tex -\ntured tool (blank), the rake face (SF) implantation resulted \nin an average reduction of feed force by 17 % but only a 2 \n% reduction of cutting force. The variant with implants on \nboth rake and flank faces (SF+FF) show increased values \nfor feed force by 11 % and cutting force by 5 %. With only \nthe flank surface implantation (FF) a reduction of 10 % of \nboth feed and cutting forces was observed. The reduction in \nforces caused by flank face implantation were close to the \n12 % reduction reported in [11] whereby flank face structur-\ning with laser ablation was performed. Since cutting force \nconstitutes the major portion of the total force, the tool vari-\nant causing the greatest reduction of cutting force, that is FF, \nwas selected for wear analysis.\nThe reduction of cutting and feed forces with laser \nimplanted tools in this study is in general less than that \nobserved with laser ablated cutting tools (see Sect.  1.1). \nThe laser implanted structures created here were limited \nto implanted spot diameters greater of around 200 /u1D707 m due \nto the 88 /u1D707 m spot diameter of the available laser. Thus the \ndomes were in effect five times larger than the widths of \nthe grooves created by various authors in literature by laser \nablation texturing which had for example groove width \nand groove depths of 20  /u1D707 m and 10  /u1D707 m [22], 50  /u1D707 m and \n20 /u1D707 m [11] and 2.2  /u1D707 m and 1.3  /u1D707 m [21]. The relatively \nlarger textures obtained with PLI process could cause \nreduction of the shear angle or hinder the flow of the chip \nas it would flow into the spaces between the individual \nimplants as shown in the finite element analysis study con -\nducted by Wu et al. [ 33]. The reduction of cutting force \nresults from the reduction of tool/chip and tool/workpiece \ncontact area resulting in lower resistance to chip flow \nand tool movement in the cutting direction. Therefore, a \nsmaller sized texture on the rake face could lead to further \nreduction of cutting forces as the chip would glide over \nthe implants without flowing into the spaces in between \nadjacent domes (see Fig.  8). Smaller textures will lead to \ngreater surface area of contact between the tool and the \nchip and would lead to increased friction. However, the \ncontact surface area will still be much smaller than that \nfor non-implanted tool. The resistance to the flow of the \nchip will also be much smaller than that for the rake face \nwith large implanted spots as the chip will not be able to \nflow between the adjacent implants.\n3.1  Tool life analysis\nCutting tests with blank tools and implanted flank face \ntools were carried out for a total of 4000 cutting cycles \nrepresenting a total length of cut of 1200 m. The tool \nlife criteria was set either at doubling of the initial cut -\nting or feed force or 200  /u1D707 m average flank wear land. \nFigure  9 shows the force measurements of three samples \nof both tool types. The flank face modified tools did not \nshow significant increase of the cutting and feed forces \nwhereas the forces for the blank tool rose exponentially \nafter about 400 m length of cut. This is primarily caused \nby the increase of the cutting edge radius which causes \nthe tool to plough the workpiece instead of cutting it (see \nSect. 3.2.3). For the implanted tools, the three test samples \ndid not reach 200 /u1D707 m flank wear and the tests were stopped \nafter 1200 m length of cut. Thus the flank face implanted \ntool have caused improvement of the tool life by factor 3. \nIn comparison, the published studies with laser ablated \nsurface texturing of cutting tools have shown tool life \nimprovements of 40–70% [ 1], 18% [11] and 10–30% [ 37].\nFig. 7  Average of three (N = 3) cutting experiments for each of the \nfour tool variations during the first 60 m length of cut\n(a) (b)\nFig. 8  Depiction of chip flow over the implanted textures on the rake \nface of the tool\n739Production Engineering (2020) 14:733–742 \n1 3\n3.2  Tool wear analysis\n3.2.1  Side flank wear\nThe wear of the side flank faces shows a clear difference \nbetween the implanted and non-implanted cutting tools. \nThe width of the non-implanted specimen reduced by \napproximately 220 \n/u1D707m(average value of three specimen) \nafter 400 m of cutting length after which two of the three \nsamples failed. The implanted cutting edges showed a tool \nwidth reduction of only 5.4 \n/u1D707 m after a cutting length of \n1200 m. Figure  10 shows one of the three specimens of \nboth implanted and blank tools before and at the end of \nthe cutting experiments.\n3.2.2  Main flank wear\nTo measure the wear land width ( \nVB ), five measurements \nper cutting edge were made between the respective VB and \nthe original cutting edge using a light microscope and the \naverage plotted over the cutting length as shown in Fig. 11. \nGraphically, a significantly stronger increase of the \nVB is \nshown for the non-textured tools compared to the implanted \ntools. The non-textured tools showed a wear mark width of \napprox. 120 \n/u1D707 m after a cutting length of 400 m, whereas the \nimplanted tools showed wear mark widths of approx. 50 /u1D707 m \nafter a cutting length of 1200 m.\nThe results showed that for the first 400 m of cut the \nimplanted tools result in approximately 80% reduction of \nflank wear compared to the non-textured tools. This is at \nleast five times more than the 13% reduction reported in \n[10] for cutting AISI 4140 steel and four times more than \nthe 21% reduction reported in [30] for turning Inconel 718 \n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 9  Average cutting and feed force of three samples each of non-\nimplanted and flank face implanted tools\nFig. 10  Wear of the side flank faces measured on the rake face\n740 Production Engineering (2020) 14:733–742\n1 3\nalloy using subtractive (laser ablated) surface textures on \ncutting tools.\nFigure 12 shows the 3d topography of one of the three \nsamples each of worn non-textured and implanted tools. In \nparticular, severe flank wear is visible through the greenish \ncoloring on the non-implanted tool. On the implanted tools, \nit can be seen that the implants have experienced severe \nabrasive wear. Especially in the middle, near the cutting \nedge, there are hardly any elevations of the implants left \nintact. The relatively good condition of the domes at the \nlateral cutting edge corners and contours shows that implants \nhave blocked the side flank wear from advancing further.\n3.2.3  Cutting edge radius\nThe cutting edge radius was measured using the GFM Mik-\nroCAD light scanning microscope. For each measurement, \n100 profile measurements per cutting edge were placed over \nthe entire width of the edge. The edge radius of the tools in \nthe ground state (start of the cutting tests) was 10 \n/u1D707 m. Fig-\nure 13 shows the increase of edge radius for implanted and \nblank tools. The non-implanted tools show a sharp increase \nof the edge radius to over 20 \n/u1D707 m in less than 200 m of cut \nresulting in the edge radius becoming larger than the uncut \nchip thickness or tooth feed resulting in ploughing instead \nof chip formation. The hard implantations seem to hinder \nthe increment of the edge radius and result in only a 15 \n/u1D707 m \nincrease after 1200 m cut length.\n4  Conclusions\nAdditive surface textures (micro-domes) were created on \nhigh speed steel tools using pulsed laser implantation of \ntungsten carbide particles. Dry cutting tests were performed \non ductile cast iron EN-GJS-800-2 using the linear cutting \ntest rig. The main conclusions were: \n1. For the selected texture size the implantation of flank \nface has shown 10 % reduction of cutting force com-\npared to only a 2 % reduction caused by rake face \nimplantation.\n2. Improvement of tool life by at least factor 3 was \nobserved with flank face implanted tools compared to \nnon-structured tools.\nFig. 11  Wear on the flank face for non-textured and implanted tools. \n(N=3)\nFig. 12  3D topography of flank face of non-textured and implanted \ntools at the end of the cutting tests\nFig. 13  Wear on the flank face for non-textured and implanted tools \n(N = 3)\n741Production Engineering (2020) 14:733–742 \n1 3\n3. Approximately 80% reduction of average width of flank \nwear land as well as 60% reduction of cutting edge \nblunting compared to non-textured tools was observed.\n4. Implantation of the flank face significantly reduced the \nwear of side flank face from 12.9% reduction of edge \nwidth with non-textured tools after 400 m of cutting to \nonly 0.3% with implanted tools after 1200 m.\n5. Further research needs to be conducted in order to evalu-\nate the effects of smaller implant size, other hard parti-\ncles as well as the effect of laser implantation on cutting \ntemperature, workpiece roughness, tool/chip contact, \nshear angle and coefficient of friction.\nFunding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt \nDEAL. \nCompliance with ethical standards \n Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of \ninterest.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attri-\nbution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adapta-\ntion, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long \nas you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, \nprovide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes \nwere made.
