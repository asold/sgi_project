  "abstract": "Stocks are an important type of investment that is affected by the economic crisis.For this reason, forecasting the direction of stocks is a significant for investors, analysts, and researchers.In this study, we propose to predict the direction of stocks in Turkish stock market (BIST100) by employing Turkish texts such as social media platforms.For this purpose, different deep learning methodologies such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and a new generation natural language processing model, namely Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are employed for classification task.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study for analyzing the direction of stocks by using both CNN, RNN, LSTM, BERT and texts from social media platforms.Experimental results represent that the utilization of deep learning models and a new generation word embedding model which is called BERT boosts the classification performance.In conclusion, using deep learning algorithms and a new generation of natural language processing model provide a valuable contribution to investors presents 96.26% of accuracy performance by predicting direction of stocks.",
