    "abstract": "This work presents the development of NOVA, an educational virtual assistant designed for the Parallel Computing course, built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture combined with Large Language Models (LLMs). The assistant operates entirely in Spanish, supporting native-language learning and increasing accessibility for students in Latin American academic settings. It integrates vector and relational databases to provide an interactive, personalized learning experience that supports the understanding of complex technical concepts. Its core functionalities include the automatic generation of questions and answers, quizzes, and practical guides, all tailored to promote autonomous learning. NOVA was deployed in an academic setting at Universidad Politécnica Salesiana. Its modular architecture includes five components: a relational database for logging, a vector database for semantic retrieval, a FastAPI backend for managing logic, a Next.js frontend for user interaction, and an integration server for workflow automation. The system uses the GPT-4o mini model to generate context-aware, pedagogically aligned responses. To evaluate its effectiveness, a test suite of 100 academic tasks was executed—55 question-and-answer prompts, 25 practical guides, and 20 quizzes. NOVA achieved a 92% excellence rating, a 21-second average response time, and 72% retrieval coverage, confirming its potential as a reliable AI-driven tool for enhancing technical education.",
