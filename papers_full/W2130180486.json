Mamishe$, B. C. Lesieutre, M. Zahn and S. H. Kang \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology \nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science \nLaboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems \nCambridge, MA, USA \nABSTRACT \nIt is important to monitor the moisture content of transformer oil in a transformer. One param- \neter of particular interest is the moisture solubility of transformer oil. It has been reported that \ntransformer oils under different conditions have different solubility. Measurements of solu- \nbility for four different types of conditioned oil are presented in this paper: fresh Shell Diala \nAX oil, lab-aged Shell Diala A oil, Texas Utility used transformer oil, and Ramapo Substation \nused transformer oil. To avoid the difficulty of achieving full saturation, this paper proposes \nan alternative method of measuring the moisture solubility in transformer oil using a rela- \ntive humidity sensor. It utilizes the linearity between the relative humidity of the oil and the \nmoisture content of the oil, to measure the solubility indirectly. The measured results of fresh \noil, lab-aged oil, and the Texas Utility oil are very close, and only Ramapo oil shows different \nsensor response characteristics and solubility. \n1 INTRODUCTION \nOST transformers in electric power delivery systems around the \nM world are filled with a dielectric liquid. The liquid functions both \nas electrical insulation and as a heat transfer agent. Newer liquids'such \nas silicone and esters have their applications in special-purpose trans- \nformers, and with more environmental concerns, there are new alter- \nnatives such as edible seed-oil-based fluid [l]. However, the liquid in \nthe majority of transformers is petroleum-based insulating mineral oil. \nConventional transformer oil is made 'by refining a fraction of the hy- \ndrocarbons collected during the distillation of a petroleum crude stock' \n121. \nIt is well recognized that moisture in oil has detrimental effects on \ntransformer performance. The presence of moisture in transformers de- \nteriorates transformer insulation by decreasing both the electrical and \nmechanical strength. The importance of moisture presence in paper and \noil systems has been recognized since the 1920's. Knowing moisture \nin oil can also predict the steady state moisture content in transformer \nboard in equilibrium with the oil [3]. \nOne important parameter in oil moisture measurements is the wa- \nter solubility. When the moisture in oil exceeds the solubility for that \ntemperature, free water will form. The conventional way to measure \nwater solubility is to make a saturated oil sample and then test the ab- \nsolute moisture content. To achieve full saturation in transformer oil is \ndifficult, especially at high temperature because of the high solubility. \nThis paper proposes an alternative method of measuring the solubility \nusing a relative humidity sensor. \nThere is a general perception that oil under different aging condi- \ntions has different solubility. It is important to know the level of accu- \nracy of this general claim, which in turn determines if extra precautions \nare necessary. Testing was carried out for four differently conditioned \noils. \n2 TRANSFORMER OIL AND ITS \nMOISTURE MEASUREMENTS \nAn excellent review of the basic concepts that are used in this pa- \nper is given in [4]. A brief introduction is given here. Transformer oil \nis made by refining crude oil. It is mainly a mixture of hydrocarbon \ncompounds of three classes: alkanes, naphthenes, and aromatic hydro- \ncarbons. These molecules have little or no polarity. A minor part of \nthe constituents is that of polar and ionic species, which may greatly \ninfluence the chemical and electrical properties of the oil. 'Polar com- \npounds found in transformer oil usually contain oxygen, nitrogen, or \nsulfur. Ionic compounds would typically be organic salts found only in \ntrace quantities' [4]. \n2.1 WATER IN OIL \nInsulating oils, such as transformer oil, have a low affinity for water. \nHowever, the solubility increases markedly with temperature for nor- \nmally refined naphthenic transformer oil. This will be discussed more \nquantitatively later in this paper. Water can exist in transformer oil in \nthree states: \n1. in practical cases, most water in oil is found in the dissolved state; \n1070-9878/11$3.00 0 2001 IEEE \nDu et al.: Moisture Solubilityin Transformer Oil 806 \n2. \n3. \ncertain discrepancies in examining the moisture content using differ- \nent measurement techniques suggests that water also exists in the oil \ntightly bound to oil molecules, especially in deteriorated oil; and \nwhen moisture in oil exceeds the saturation value, there will be free \nwater precipitated from oil in suspension or drops. Moisture in oil \nis measured in parts per million (ppm) using the weight of moisture \ndivided by the weight of oil (pg/g). \n2.2 RELATIVE HUMIDITY \nRelative humidity (RH) can be defined in terms of the moisture mix- \ning ratio T versus the saturaiion mixing ratio T~, RH %=lOOr/r,, which \nis a dimensionless percentage. Relative humidity for air is the water \nvapor content of the air rehtive to its content at saturation. Relative \nhumidity for oil is the dissolved water content of the oil relative to the \nmaximum capacity of moisture that the oil can hold at that tempera- \nture. Because the saturation mixing ratio is a function of pressure, and \nespecially of temperature, the relative humidity is a combined index of \nthe environment and reflects more than water content [5]. \n2.3 MOISTURE MEASUREMENT \nMETHODS FOR \nTRANSFORM ER 01 L \nThere are two types of off-line methods to measure the moisture in \noil: the Karl Fischer reaction method and the pressure gauge method. \nThe standard test method for measuring water in transformer oil \nis the ASTM D 1533 test [6] known as the Karl Fischer reaction test. \nIt is based on the reaction of halogens with water in the presence of \nanhydrous sulfur dioxide. It is widely used because of its high selec- \ntivity and sensitivity. There are commercial instruments such as the \nMitsubishi Moisture Meter tci accomplish the Karl Fischer titration auto- \nmatically With these instruments, an oil sample can be directly injected \ninto the reaction unit and the moisture content will be given at the end \nof the reaction. In the case ihat the liquid samples contain interfering \nsubstances reacting with the reagents, the oil samples are placed in a \nwater vaporizer and then the water vapor is circulated to the reaction \nunit to be measured. \nThe pressure gauge method ’consists of degassing and dehydrating, \nby extraction in a vacuum, a known quantity from the studied body, oil, \npaper impregnated or non-impregnated, then to separate the different \nvolatile compounds collected either by condensation on a cold point, \nor by combustion’ [7]. The eKtracted water is then heated to vapor and \nthe vapor pressure, measured by a mercury pressure gauge, is propor- \ntional to the quantity of water content. This method was proposed by \nB. Fallou [7], but not widely used. \nThese direct methods require removing the moisture, so they are not \npractical for on-line monitoring of the transformer insulation. \nThere are commercially available meters that measure the relative \nhumidity of the transformer oil in real time such as the Harley mois- \nture sensor from J. W. Harley Inc., and Aquaoil 100A from Syprotech. \nThe relative humidity can be converted to absolute moisture content by \nmultiplying the relative hurnidity with the saturation moisture (solu- \nbility) of transformer oil at the measured temperature. \nTable 1. Comparison of estimated parameter:; for the Arrhenius form \nin (I) of the solubility of water in transformer oil as a function of tem- \nperature. \nI Oommen [19] I Griffin [9] I \nAI 7.42 I 7.09 I \n3 WATER SOLUBILITY IN OIL \n3.1 EXISTING METHODS \nOne way of determining water solubility is by the use of the new \nASTM Standard Test Method D 4056-92 [8]. This method estimates the \nsolubility of water in hydrocarbons at different temperatures based on \ncalculations from values for density, refractive index, and molecular \nweight. This is not a very practical way to measure the water solubility. \nA more conventional way is to make a saturated oil sample and then \nmeasure the absolute moisture content using the standard test method \nfor measuring water in transformer oil, the ASTM D 1533 test method \nknown as the Karl Fischer reaction method [6]. To achieve full satura- \ntion in transformer oil is not a trivial task, especially at high tempera- \nture because of the increasing solubility. \nTwo ways have been generally adopted for making saturated solu- \ntions: \n1. Bubble moist air through the oil. We found it difficult to achieve satu- \nration at high temperature using this method without a well designed \nsystem like that shown in the Appendix of [9]. \n2. Directly add free water. \nOne improper practice is simply adding an excess amount of water \nto a sample, shake it up, let stand overnight and then measure water \nconcentration. It is not an acceptable way of measuring the solubility \nbecause the diffusion process in the oil is very slow, and letting the \nsoluiion stand overnight does not guarantee full dissolution. Also, ex- \ncess free water in the oil will cause an erroneous measurement of water \nsolubility, i.e. the free water might be sampled and measured as wa- \nter dissolved in oil. Even though water is heavier than the oil, small \nwater bubbles can still exist near the upper body of the oil by surface \ntension. The measurement results of such samples are non-repeatable \nand inconsistent. The proper implementation of this method is to add \nwater and mix well until free water is observed. The mixture should \nbe centrifuged to remove any entrained water and then decanted. The \ncorrect implementation of both methods requires extra equipment and \ncare. \n3.2 LITERATURE REPORTED \nWATER SOLUBILITY IN OIL \nThe water solubility for oil can be expressed in Arrhenius form as \n(1) \nwhere rs is the saturation solubility of water in oil in ppm and T is the \ntemperature in O Kelvin. Different coefficients A and B by different au- \nthors are shown in Table 1, and the calculated oil solubility at different \ntemperatures is given in Table 2. \nThe Shell and Oommen’s data agree very well over the entire tem- \nperature range. Griffin’s data differs from the Shell and Oommen data \n-B logTs 1 A - - \nT \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insula tion \nTable 2.

The linearity between the relative \nhumidity of the oil and the moisture content of the oil is utilized to iind \nthe solubility: \n(2) \nR r = r,x- 100 \nwhere R is the relative humidity (%), T the water concentration in ppm \nat temperature T, and r, is the water solubility in ppm at the same \ntemperature T. By measuring the slope of the curve of moisture concen- \ntration vs. relative humidity, or the intercept of the curve at R=100%, \none can fmd the water solubility instead of trying to directly measure \nthe moisture content at 100% relative humidity. \nThe Mitsubishi moisture meter model CA-05, based on micropro- \ncessor controlled Coulometric Karl Fischer titrimetry, is used to mea- \nsure the absolute moisture content in oil. The commercially available \nHarley moisture sensor, a capacitive polymer sensor [lo, 111, is used \nto measure the relative humidity of transformer oil. To verify that the \nHarley moisture sensor responds to the relative moisture level rather \nthan the absolute moisture level, previous research [12] used two iden- \ntical Harley sensors at various temperatures in both transformer oil and \nsilicone oil which have different saturation moisture levels. An experi- \nment that had the same absolute moisture level in transformer oil and \nsilicone oil at the same temperature had different output voltages. This \nconfirmed that the Harley sensor does not respond to the absolute mois- \nture content because if it did the output voltages of the two sensors in \nthe different oils would be the same. \nFigure 1 shows the Harley CT-8804 moisture sensor used in this \ninvestigation. It consists of a dual sensor [13], a full range (0 to 100% \nRH) thin-film capacitive humidity sensor and a thin-film platinum RTD \ntemperature sensor, combined with a linearized 4 to 20 mA, two-wire \ncurrent transmitter. The unit transmits a 4 to 20 mA current signal for \na moisture range of 0 to 100% saturation. The temperature corrected \ncurrent output is converted into equivalent dc voltage output across \nan externally connected load resistor. The newly shipped sensor was \nVol. 8 No. 5, October 2001 807 \nFigure 1. Harley CT-800 moisture sensor. The sensing element is at \nthe bottom of the long rod. \ncalibrated in fresh Shell Diala AX oil as shown in Figure 2. The titration \nresults are obtained by dividing the moisture content by the solubility \nof the Shell Diala AX oil at that temperature. The reported solubility \nvalue of Shell Diala AX oil [14] is used for calibration. The ideal relative \nhumidity R (YO) is obtained by converting the output voltage V by the \nideal transfer function \n(3) (V - 'min') 100 = 25(V - 1) R= 4 \nwhere I,i,=4~10-~ A and R=250 0. After two years of use in hot \ntransformer oil in our laboratory apparatus, the sensor was recalibrated \nas shown in Figure 3. By calibration, the relative humidity of the oil is \nrelated to the measured sensor output voltage by \nwhere Vmi,=1.06 V for the calibrated sensor. The fitted function of (4) \ndiffers from the ideal function given in (3) due to the instrumentation \ndeviations and the drifting of operating point of the sensor over the \nyears. Nevertheless, the calibration indicates a very good linear rela- \ntionship between sensor output and the relative humidity. \nR = 22.005(V - Vmin) - 1.308 (4) \n5 DIFFERENTLY CONDITIONED \nOILS \nThe measurements are taken for four types of differently condi- \ntioned oils at 35°C: fresh Shell Diala AX oil, lab-aged Shell Diala A oil, \nTexas Utility (TU) used transformer oil, and Ramapo Substation used \ntransformer oil.

Shell Diala AX \noil is Type I1 oil, for more severe service applications requiring greater \noxidation resistance. It contains = 0.2%wt (2000 ppm) of oxidation in- \nhibitor. The lab-aged oil is prepared by heating new oil at 70°C for two \nweeks with a mixture of moisture and oxygen, because heat, moisture \nand oxygen are the major aging factors. The oil is circulated within an \nopen vessel by a pump for thorough mixing. The TU oil was taken from \na transformer that was in service at Texas Utilities. The Ramapo oil was \ntaken from a single phase of ii 500/345 kV, 333 MVA (per phase) trans- \nformer at the Ramapo Substation that experienced failure due to static \nelectrification. Because of the small quantity of the oil availability, the \ntested Ramapo oil is a mixture of 80% Ramapo original oil and 20% of \nnew Shell Diala A oil. \nThree of the tested oils were analyzed by Doble Engineering Com- \npany. Representative results are listed in Table 3 [15]. The interfacial \ntension (IFT) and the neutralization number (mg KOH/g) of the oil pro- \nvide an indication of the degree of aging and contamination. In general, \nthe more aged the oil, the lower the IFT and the larger the neutralization \nnumber. \nTable 3.

The results \nare summarized in Table 4. Although the color of Ramapo is darker \nthan TU, they do not differ much in the color scale defined by ASTM \nstandard D1500 [16]. In addition, there were no significant differences \nmeasured in the neutralization number for the tested oils. \ninfrared (IR) scans are also performed for the oils. The IR analysis is \nused by organic chemists for qualitative determination of the presence \nor absence of specific functional groups in a mixture [17]. One IR scan \nwas done with a 1 mm cell path and with new oil in the path of the \nreference beam. This type of test for the tested Ramapo oil and TU \noil is shown in Figures 4 and 5. This allows for detection of oxidation \ninhibitor at 3660 cm-' and for carbonyl compounds at 1700 to 1730 cm-'. \nLittle to none oxidation inhibitor was detected for all oils. Carbonyl \ncompounds are mostly from oxidation of insulating materials. Both \nnon-mixed Ramapo oil and tested mixed Ramapo oil have a little more \nabsorbance in this region, suggesting that they contain a higher amount \nof (non-acid) carbonyl compounds than the other two oils. \nAnother IR scan was performed using a 0.2 mm cell path and air as \nthe reference, which provides a fingerprint of the oil. Shown in Fig- \nures 6 and 7 are the test results for the tested Ramapo and TU oils. \nThe differences are subtle, nevertheless are noticeable. The original test \ncurves were recorded on large chart paper, more than twice the size \nshown here and the difference among curves were easier to be identi- \nfied. Some differences are listed in Table 5 for example. The signature \nband is mostly - 700 to 1200 cm-'. It shows that the Ramapo and TU \noils are different products. \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Vol. 8 No. 5, October 2001 809 \nFigure 4.

It is well mixed by a mag- \nnetic stirrer and the temperature is controlled by an Omega temperature \nprobe and controller. The moisture is bubbled into the kettle by flowing \na constant air flow through a flask of de-ionized water. \nThe measured oil solubilities and conductivities are listed in Table 6 \nand the data and fitted linear curves are shown in Figure 8. The conduc- \ntivities of the oils are measured by a gapped tuning capacitor immersed \nin the oils. The moisture measurements for the Ramapo oil appeared to \nbe erratic and a linear interpolation did not produce meaningful read- \ning near the origin. The possible reasons are discussed in Section 6.1. \n6.1 DISCUSSION \nThe results obtained with fresh oil, lab-aged oil, and the TU oil are \nvery close, whereas the result for Ramapo oil is very different from the \nrest. Lab tests show the Ramapo oil is not very aged, however, an er- \nratic power factor is measured. There might be contaminants or moist \nTable 6.

Indeed Golovan et al. [18] also observed that the increase of \npolar impurities in the oil \"leads to a significant increase in oil hygro- \nscopicity and a breakdown of the linear relationship between the water \nuptake capacity and the relative humidity of the air\". This observation \nalso serves as a caution for using the moisture sensor in contaminated \noil. Because of the nonlinear behavior of the sensor output, the pre- \ndicted value of solubility of Ramapo oil is only a rough estimation. \nThe proposed method is effective only when the sensor response \nis linear. Another possibility is that the contaminants in the oil could \naffect the chemical reaction process of the Karl Fischer titration and \n81 0 Du et al.: Moisture Solubilityin Transformer Oil \nWAVENlJMBER (CM ) ___- WAVEN~MBER (a 81 \n--” I_- \nAT- \nFigure 6.

From their measurements of \nten in-service aged oils and two oils with accelerated oxidation in the \nlaboratory, they concluded that: ”oils which.are in serviceable condi- \ntion show little change in their water solubility characteristics. Only \nwhen the oil is severely aged or contaminated would the solubility be \nexpected to increase significantly”. Our results agree with the Doble \nconclusion. \n7 CONCLUSION \nOISTURE solubility is one important parameter in oil moisture \nMm easurements. This paper aims to propose a new method to mea- \nsure moisture solubility; and examine the general perception that the \ntransformer oils under different conditions have different solubility. \nA measurement technique exploiting the linearity between the rela- \ntive humidity of the oil and the moisture content of the oil to indirectly \nmeasure the solubility is proposed. It avoids the difficulty of achiev- \ning full saturation of the test sample and associated errors. However, it \ncan give the correct solubility only when the sensor response maintains \nlinearity. \nWhile moisture is an important parameter for the oil condition, our \ntest results indicated that there were no significant differences in mois- \nture solubility among differently aged oils. This agrees with Grifhn‘s \nresults [9] indicating that normal operation under service temperature \nis less likely to change the water solubility significantly. We believe that \nthis work contributes to the present limited understanding of the aging \nus. moisture solubility relationship. \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Vol. 8 No. 5, October 2001 811 \n120 \n-100 \n2 - 5 EO \nE \ni; \n60 \n5 ,- 0 \n2 40 \n2 \n(D - B 20 \nM \nI, I .. ,, Fresh Shell - \n=Lab AgedShell ----- \nATeXaS Utilitv - - , i..' \neRamaD0 \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 EO 90 100 \nRelative Humidity (%) \nFigure 8.
