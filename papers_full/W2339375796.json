  "full_text": "OPEN\nORIGINAL ARTICLE\nUltraconserved region-containing Transformer 2 β4 controls\nsenescence of colon cancer cells\nK Kajita, Y Kuwano, Y Satake, S Kano, K Kurokawa, Y Akaike, K Masuda, K Nishida and K Rokutan\nUltraconserved regions (UCRs) are 4200 bp genomic segments with perfect human-to-rodent sequence identity. Transcribed UCRs\nconstitute a new category of noncoding RNAs whose functions remain poorly understood. The human transformer 2 β (TRA2B) gene\ncontains a 419-bp UCR spanning the 276-bp exon 2 and its neighboring introns. TRA2B exon 2 has premature stop codons, whereas\nan exon 2 -containing splice variant ( TRA2β4) was expressed preferentially in the nuclei of human colon cancer cells. TRA2β4\nknockdown p53-independently stimulated CDKN1A transcription and increased p21, resulting in the appearance of senescent cells.\nBiotin pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assays revealed that TRA2β4 interacted with Sp1 through a Sp1-binding sequence\n(485-GGGG-488) in a stem-loop structure of exon 2. Mutation of this sequence (485-AAGG-488) disrupted the stem-loop structure,\nblocked the interaction with Sp1 and increased CDKN1A transcription. Overexpression of TRA2β4 signiﬁcantly decreased CDKN1A\nmRNA levels and accelerated cell growth, but the introduction of the mutation in the Sp1-binding sequence completely canceled\nthese effects. Taken together, TRA2β4 may sequester Sp1 from occupying promoters of target genes including CDKN1A, promoting\ncell growth by interrupting the senescence-related gene expression program. This novel function of TRA2β4 may uncover an\noncogenic function of transcribed UCRs.\nOncogenesis (2016) 5, e213; doi:10.1038/oncsis.2016.18; published online 4 April 2016\nINTRODUCTION\nAlternative splicing of pre-mRNAs generates protein diversity\nfrom a limited number of genes.\n1 The utilization of alternative\nsplice sites is regulated by cis-acting elements and trans-acting\nfactors through the interaction of a family of serine/arginine\n(SR)-rich splicing factors (SRSFs) and heterogeneous nuclear\nribonucleoproteins. Alternative splicing occurs in a developmental\nstage-, sex- or tissue-speci ﬁc manner and in response to\nthe surrounding microenvironment.\n2,3 High-throughput RNA\nsequencing of tissue-speci ﬁc splicing events indicates that\n490% of human genes produce multiple spliced isoforms. 3 At\nthe same time, aberrant alternative splicing participates in many\ngenetic and acquired diseases including cancer.\n2,4\nAn SR-like protein transformer 2 β (Tra2β) regulates splice site\nselection of several genes encoding calcitonin/calcitonin\ngene-related peptide ( CGRP), survival motor neuron 1 ( SMN1)\nand microtubule-associated protein tau ( TAU) in a concentration-\ndependent manner. 5– 7 Several lines of evidence suggest that\noverexpressed Tra2 β may be involved in the pathogenesis of\ncancer.8– 10 The human TRA2β (TRA2B) gene is composed of 10\nexons and 9 introns. TRA2B contains a 419-bp genomic segment\nwith perfect human-to-rodent sequence identity, termed the\nultraconserved region (UCR; uc.138, see Supplementary Figure S1)\nspanning the 276-bp exon 2 and its neighboring introns.\n11,12\nTRA2B generates ﬁve mRNA isoforms ( TRA2β1–5) through\nalternative splicing and usage of alternative promoters or\npolyadenylation sites (Figure 1a). 12 Because of the existence of\nmultiple premature termination codons (PTCs) in TRA2B exon 2, an\nexon 2-containing TRA2β4 mRNA isoform (hereafter referred as\nTRA2β4) is not translated and should be actively degraded\nthrough nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a surveillance\nmechanism that degrades PTC-containing mRNAs. However,\noxidative stress speci ﬁcally facilitated TRA2β4 isoform production\nin rat gastric mucosa and a human gastric cancer cell line (AGS). 13\nRecently, it has become apparent that non-protein-coding\nRNAs (ncRNAs) are functionally important for normal development\nand physiology, as well as for pathologic processes. 14 ncRNAs can\nbe broadly classi ﬁed into small (18 – 200 nt) and long ncRNAs\n(200 nt to 4100 kb).15 Among them, epigenetic and genetic\ndefects in a class of small ncRNAs called microRNAs are now\nrecognized as a common hallmark of cancer. However, other\nncRNAs, such as transcribed UCRs (T-UCRs), small nucleolar RNAs,\nPIWI-interacting RNAs or large intergenic noncoding RNAs, may\nalso contribute to the development of many different diseases.\nThere are 481 described UCRs, and more than half of them do not\nencode any protein.\n11 However, 68% of UCRs are transcribed,\nconstituting a new category of ncRNAs, the T-UCRs. 16 The wide\ndistribution in the genome and lack of natural variation in the\nhuman population suggest an essential functional role in normal\ncells.\n11,17 Recent genome-wide expression pro ﬁling studies have\nshown that certain T-UCRs are differentially expressed in human\nleukemias and carcinomas. 16,18,19 Expression of those UCRs was\nsuggested to be regulated by microRNAs, and the inhibition of an\noverexpressed T-UCR (uc. 73) induced apoptosis of colon cancer\ncells.\n16 T-UCRs are widely expressed in neuroblastomas and their\nexpression correlates with important clinicogenetic parameters\nsuch as MYCN ampliﬁcation status. 20 However, the functional role\nof T-UCRs in cancer development is largely unknown.\nHere, we introduce TRA2β4 as a functional T-UCR preferentially\nexpressed in colon cancer cells. TRA2β4 may exert an oncogenic\nfunction by controlling senescence of colon cancer cells.\nDepartment of Pathophysiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, Japan.

However, when expression levels of\nTRA2β4 and TRA2β1 were examined in different colon cancer cell\nlines, all cell lines tested expressed signi ﬁcant amounts of TRA2β4\n(Figure 1b, upper panel). TRA2β4 levels were estimated to be\n10– 20% of those of TRA2β1 mRNA that encodes a full-length Tra2 β\nprotein. On the other hand, TRA2β1 mRNA was not consistently\noverexpressed in the colon cancer cell lines (Figure 1b, lower\npanel). Human colon cancer (HCT116) cells expressed mainly\nTRA2β1 mRNA and increased TRA2β4 isoform production after\nexposure to sodium arsenite (Supplementary Figures S2b and c) as\nsimilarly observed in gastric cancer cells. 13\nInactivation of NMD with cycloheximide increased the amounts\nof PTC-containing mRNA variants of SRSF3 and SRSF9 (Figure 1c).\nIn contrast, cycloheximide treatment failed to increase TRA2β4\nlevels, which was con ﬁrmed by quantitative real-time reverse\ntranscription– (qPCR) (Figure 1c) and Northern blot analysis\n(Figure 1d). Two different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting\na key regulator of NMD (UPF1) effectively reduced UPF1 mRNA\nlevels (Supplementary Figure S3a) and signi ﬁcantly increased the\namounts of SRSF3 and SRSF9 PTC variants (Supplementary\nFigure S3b), but they did not increase TRA2β4 (Figure 1e).\nTo explain why NMD did not control TRA2β4 expression, we\nprepared nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from HCT116 cells. The\npurity of each fraction was con ﬁrmed by western blotting using\nantibodies for cytosolic ( α-tubulin) and nuclear (heterogeneous\nnuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2) marker proteins (Figure 2a), and\nFigure 1. Expression of TRA2β1 and TRA2β4 in colon cancer cell lines. ( a) Schematic diagram of the human TRA2B gene. Exons (ex) are indicated\nby open boxes and Arabic numbers. Filled boxes denote the ultraconserved exon 2. Five splice variants generated from TRA2B and the use of\neach exon are shown. ( b) Amounts of TRA2β4 (upper panel) and TRA2β1 (lower panel) mRNAs in normal human colon and colon cancer cell\nlines (HCT116, RKO, HT29, Caco-2, T84 and SW480) were measured by qPCR using GAPDH mRNA as an endogenous quantity control. Values\nare means ±s.d. from three independent experiments. *Signi ﬁcantly different by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni test ( Po0.05).\n(c) HCT116 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for 4 h to inhibit NMD. Then, changes in mRNA levels of TRA2β1, TRA2 β4,\nSRSF3 PTC and SRSF9 PTC were measured by qPCR using GAPDH mRNA as an endogenous quantity control. Values are means ±s.d. from three\nindependent experiments. ( d) After treatment of HCT116 cells with 50 or 100 μg/ml CHX for 4 h, TRA2β4 levels were assayed by Northern\nhybridization with a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe targeting for exon 2 . 18S rRNA was used as a loading control. ( e) After treatment of\nHCT116 cells with 10 n M of two different UPF1 siRNAs for 48 h, changes in TRA2β4 mRNA levels were measured by qPCR using GAPDH mRNA as\nan endogenous quantity control. Values are means ±s.d. from three independent experiments.\nTRA2β4 represses cancer cell senescence\nK Kajita et al\n2\nOncogenesis (2016), 1 – 11\nby reverse transcription – PCR (RT – PCR) using primers targeting\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) pre-mRNA\n(Figure 2b). RT – PCR ampli ﬁed TRA2β4 in nuclear fractions\ncontaining GAPDH pre-mRNA, but not in cytosolic fractions,\nwhereas TRA2β1 mRNA was distributed in both nuclear and\ncytoplasmic fractions (Figure 2b). qPCR measurement showed that\nTRA2β4 was signi ﬁcantly enriched in the nucleus, compared with\nTRA2β1 and GAPDH mRNAs (Figure 2c). RNA ﬂuorescence in situ\nhybridization revealed that overexpressed TRA2β4 signals were\npresent preferentially in the nuclei, whereas TRA2β1 mRNA\nsignals were distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm\n(Figure 2d). We also con ﬁrmed that HeLa cells constitutively\nexpressed TRA2β4 in their nuclei similar to a nucleus-retained\nnoncoding RNA ( MEN ε/β) (Supplementary Figure S4a). Transiently\noverexpressed TRA2β4 was retained predominantly in the nuclei\nof HEK293T as well as of HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S4b).\nThese results suggest that signi ﬁcant amounts of TRA2β4 are\nretained in the nucleus and may escape from NMD-mediated\ndegradation.\nTRA2β4 knockdown inhibits cell growth\nTo test the possibility that the TRA2β4 variant might be a\nfunctional T-UCR, we prepared two different siRNAs against TRA2β\nmRNAs (Tra2 β siRNA targeting exon 6 and TRA2β4 siRNA targeting\nexon 2) and examined the effects of these siRNAs on cell growth.\nAlthough Tra2 β siRNA was designed to degrade both TRA2β1 and\nTRA2β4 isoforms, it degraded TRA2β1 more effectively than\nTRA2β4 probably because of the predominant expression of the\nTRA2β1 isoform (Figure 3a). Consequently, Tra2 β siRNA effectively\nreduced Tra2 β protein (Figure 3b). In contrast, TRA2β4 siRNA\nselectively reduced TRA2β4 without changing TRA2β1 mRNA and\nTra2β protein levels (Figures 3a and b). Treatment with Tra2 β\nsiRNA signi ﬁcantly inhibited cell growth (Figure 3c) in association\nwith an increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-\nmediated UTP end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells (Figure 3d)\nand activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and\ncaspase-3 (Figure 3e). It was of interest that TRA2β4 siRNA did\nnot change TRA2β1 mRNA or Tra2 β protein levels, but it did inhibit\ncell growth (Figure 3c). Moreover, the selective TRA2β4\nknockdown did not signi ﬁcantly increase TUNEL-positive cells\n(Figure 3d) and did not activate PARP and caspase-3 (Figure 3e).\nTRA2β4 knockdown induces cellular senescence\nAs shown in Figure 4a, TRA2β4 siRNA-treated HCT116 cells\ndisplayed unique morphological changes, that is, the cells spread\nout their cytoplasm and became thinner. These enlarged cells\nwere positive for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA- β-gal)\n(Figure 4a). To con ﬁrm that TRA2β4 siRNA induced cellular\nsenescence, we examined the expression of cyclin-dependent\nkinase inhibitors that have a crucial role in cell-cycle arrest and\ninduction of senescence. 21 Owing to a frameshift mutation in the\nINK4A gene and the hypermethylated promoter, p16 protein was\nundetectable in HCT116 cells. 22 As shown in Figure 4b, treatment\nwith TRA2β4 siRNA, but not with Tra2 β1 siRNA, increased p21\nlevels. To avoid off-targeting effects, an additional siRNA targeting\nanother sequence in TRA2β4 (TRA2β4 siRNA no. 2) were used.\nFigure 2. Subcellular distribution of TRA2β4 in HCT116 cells. ( a) After nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared from HCT116 cells, the\npurity of each fraction was monitored by measuring a cytosolic protein ( α-tubulin) and a nuclear protein (heterogeneous nuclear\nribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C1/C2) by western blotting. ( b) Total RNA was extracted from each fraction and TRA2β1 mRNA or TRA2β4 was\nampliﬁed by RT – PCR using speci ﬁc primer sets. The purity of each faction was also assessed by RT – PCR measurement of GAPDH pre-mRNA.\n(c) TRA2β1, TRA2β4 and GAPDH mRNA levels in each fraction were measured by qPCR. Nuclear-to-cytosolic distribution ratio of each mRNA was\ncalculated. Nuclear enrichment of TRA2β1 mRNA or TRA2β4 is indicated by comparing values to nuclear/cytosolic distribution ratio of GAPDH\nmRNA. Values are means ±s.d. from three independent experiments. ( d) Subcellular localization of TRA2β4 and TRA2β1 mRNA in HCT116 cells\nwas examined by RNA ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) using locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes against exon 2 and exon 1 – 3\njunction of TRA2β1 mRNA (green), respectively, as described in Materials and methods section. Cells were counterstained with TO-PRO-3\n(blue). Scale bars, 5 μm.\nTRA2β4 represses cancer cell senescence\nK Kajita et al\n3\nOncogenesis (2016), 1 – 11\nTransfection of TRA2β4 siRNA no. 2 also increased CDKN1A mRNA\nand p21 protein levels, and the percentage of SA- β-gal-positive\ncells (Supplementary Figure S5). It should be noted that\nTRA2β4 knockdown did not induce p53 (Figure 4b), and that\nTRA2β4 siRNA-mediated p21 induction occurred even in p53-null\n(p53− / −) HCT116 cells (Figure 4c). These results suggested that\nthe reduction of TRA2β4 might increase CDKN1A mRNA and\np21 protein levels in a p53-independent manner. We also\nconﬁrmed that TRA2β4 knockdown similarly induced\nmorphological changes and SA- β-gal in p53 − / − HCT116 cells\n(Supplementary Figures S6a and b).\nA human ﬁbroblast cell line (TIG-3) exhibited an age-associated\nreduction of TRA2β4 levels (Figure 4d). Reciprocal changes in\nTRA2β4 and CDKN1A mRNA expression were also observed along\nwith senescence of TIG-3 and another human ﬁbroblast cell line\n(WI-38); senescent cells decreased TRA2β4 expression in\nassociation with increased expression of CDKN1A mRNA\n(Figures 4e and f). These results suggest that TRA2β4 may regulate\np21 expression during replicative senescence.\nTRA2β4 interacts with Sp1 and regulates CDKN1A transcription\nTRA2β4 knockdown did not affect the stability of CDKN1A mRNA\n(Supplementary Figure S7a) and p21 protein (Supplementary\nFigure S7b) or the translation rate of p21 (Supplementary\nFigure S7c), suggesting that the reduction of TRA2β4 may facilitate\nCDKN1A transcription. To con ﬁrm this, we cloned the 5 ′ ﬂank of\nCDKN1A (from − 2688 to +31 bp), and HCT116 cells were\ntransfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing\n− 2688/+31, − 774/+31 or − 163/+31 bp region of the human\nCDKN1A promoter (Figure 5a). The − 2688/+31 bp region\ncontained two p53-binding sites and exhibited basal and\nTRA2β4 siRNA-mediated upregulation of CDKN1A promoter\nactivity (Figure 5a). The − 163/+31 bp region as well as the\n− 774/+31 bp region lost the p53-binding sites and markedly\nreduced the basal promoter activity. However, these two regions\nstill responded to TRA2β4 knockdown and increased the luciferase\nactivity. The − 163/+31 bp region contained a cluster of\nSp1-binding sites that likely mediated the response to TRA2β4\nknockdown. To further investigate how reduction of TRA2β4\nresulted in the stimulation of CDKN1A transcription, we performed\nchromatin immunoprecipitation assays with an anti-Sp1 antibody\nusing control or TRA2β4 siRNA-treated HCT116. Sp1 did not bind\nto the -560/-226 region or the − 325/+51 bp region in control\nsiRNA-treated cells (Figure 5b), whereas in TRA2β4 siRNA-treated\ncells, Sp1 bound to the -325/+51 bp region containing the cluster\nof Sp1-binding sites, but not to the − 560/ − 226 bp region\n(Figure 5b). These results suggest that Sp1 binding to the CDKN1A\nFigure 3. Effect of TRA2β4 silencing on cell proliferation and apoptosis. ( a) After HCT116 cells were treated with 10 n M of TRA2β4 or Tra2β siRNA\nfor 48 h, TRA2β1 mRNA and TRA2β4 levels were measured by qPCR using GAPDH as an endogenous quantity control. Values are means ±s.d.\nfrom six independent experiments. ( b) HCT116 cells were treated with 10 n M TRA2β4, Tra2β or control siRNA for 48 h, and then the amounts of\nTra2β were measured by western blotting using β-actin as a loading control. ( c) HCT116 cells (1.5 × 10 4 cells) were seeded in 35-mm-diameter\ndishes and transfected with 10 n M TRA2β4, Tra2 β or control siRNA. Subsequently, growing cells were harvested and counted at the indicated\ntimes. Values are means ±s.d. from four independent experiments. *Signi ﬁcantly different by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni test\n(Po0.05). ( d) After HCT116 cells were treated with 10 n M TRA2β4, Tra2 β or control siRNA for 24 h, they were labeled using the DeadEnd\nColorimetric TUNEL system (left panels), and the percentages of TUNEL-positive cells were determined (right panel). Values are means ±s.d.\nfrom three independent experiments. *Signi ﬁcantly different by ANOVA and Bonferroni test ( Po0.05). Scale bars, 50 μm. (e) After treatment of\nHCT116 cells with 10 n M TRA2β4, Tra2β or control siRNA for 48 h, whole-cell lysates were prepared from these cells. The levels of unprocessed\nor cleaved caspase-3 and PARP were measured by western blotting using β-actin as a loading control.\nTRA2β4 represses cancer cell senescence\nK Kajita et al\n4\nOncogenesis (2016), 1 – 11\npromoter may be blocked when signi ﬁcant amounts of\nTRA2β4 are present in the nucleus of HCT116 cells. The\ncrucial role of Sp1 was also con ﬁrmed by two additional\nﬁndings. That is, knockdown of Sp1 almost signi ﬁcantly blocked\nthe TRA2β4 silencing-induced upregulation of CDKN1A\npromoter activity (Figure 5c), CDKNA1A mRNA expression\n(Figure 5d), and p21 protein expression (Figure 5e). In addition,\nco-transfection of Sp1 siRNA with TRA2β4 siRNA reduced\nTRA2β4-mediated increase in the percentage of SA- β-gal-positive\ncells (Figure 5d). Thus, the Sp1 elements seemed to play a pivotal\nrole in the transcriptional activation of CDKN1A after silencing of\nTRA2β4.\nAs shown in Figure 6a, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays\nindicated that an anti-Sp1 antibody retrieved endogenous TRA2β4\nmore effectively than TRA2β1 mRNA or other control RNAs, such as\nUBC, U6 and 18S, suggesting the association between Sp1 and\nTRA2β4. We prepared a plasmid encoding full-length TRA2β4\nbearing bacteriophage MS2 hairpins (pMS- TRA2β4; Figure 6b).\nHCT116 cells were co-transfected with pMS- TRA2β4 and\npMS2-yellow ﬂuorescence protein (YFP) bearing an YFP-fused\nMS2-binding protein. 23 Using this system, we again con ﬁrmed\nthe association between MS2-tagged TRA2β4 and Sp1 in\nYFP-immunoprecipitated materials (Figure 6c). The presence of\nexon 2 in TRA2β4 is the only difference between TRA2β4 and\nTRA2β1, biotin-pull-down assays with HCT116 cells transcribing\nTRA2β exon 1, 2 or 3 RNA demonstrated the speci ﬁc association of\nSp1 with TRA2β exon 2 RNA (Figure 6d). As shown in Figure 6e,\nTRA2β4 exon 2 contains two Sp1 consensus sequences\n(485-GGGG-488 and 515-ACGG-518). CentroidFold (http://www.\nncrna.org/centroidfold) and M-FOLD (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/\n?q = mfold) programs indicate that TRA2β4 contains a stem-loop\nstructure within exon 2 (449 – 488 nt, underlined in Figure 6e).\nBoth programs also indicate that the introduction of two-point\nmutations at the Sp1-binding sequence (exon 2 mt-1,\n485-GGGG-488 to 485- AAGG-488) completely disrupts the\nstem-loop structure (Figure 6e). The MS2 RNA hairpin-tagging\nsystem was again used to identify the interaction between exon 2\nand Sp1. We constructed pMS2-LUC ( Renilla luciferase gene\n(LUC))-exon 2 wild-type (exon 2 wt), pMS2-LUC-exon 2 mt-1 and\npMS2-LUC-exon 2 mutated at another Sp1-binding sequence\n(exon 2 mt-2, 515-ACGG-518 to 515-AC AA-518) (Figure 6f) and\ntransfected into HCT116 cells (Figure 6g). RIP between Sp1 and\nLUC-fused exon 2 constructs indicated that two-point mutations in\nthe stem-loop motif (exon 2 mt-1), but not in another Sp1-binding\nFigure 4.

Sp1 is crucial for transcription\nof these genes. 24– 26\nExpression of TRA2β4 in colon cancer cells promotes cell growth\nTo investigate the possible roles of TRA2β4 in human colon cancer,\nwe generated a pCMV construct encoding TRA2β4 (pCMV-TRA2β4)\nor TRA2β4 containing the mutation (exon 2 mt-1, 485-GGGG-488\nto 485- AAGG-488) in the stem-loop motif (pCMV- TRA2β4mt).\nOverexpression of TRA2β4 could signi ﬁcantly decease CDKN1A\nmRNA levels and accelerate cell growth, but the introduction of\nthe mutation completely cancel these effects (Figures 7a and b).\nWe also con ﬁrmed that the increased levels of TRA2β4 or\nTRA2β4mt did not affect TRA2β1 and p53 mRNA levels (Figure 7a).\nFinally, we measured the expression of TRA2β4 in 24 different\ncDNA libraries prepared from patients with colon cancer\n(Figure 7c). The relative expression of TRA2β4 varied depending\non individual paired samples; however, colon cancer tissues\nexpressed signi ﬁcantly higher levels of TRA2β4, compared with\nsurrounding normal tissues.\nDISCUSSION\nAmong 481 UCRs discovered, 325 UCRs are transcribed and\nimplicated to function as noncoding RNAs, whereas their speci ﬁc\nfunctions are not fully investigated. 16 We show here that human\ncolon cancer cells express signi ﬁcant amounts of a T-UCR\n(TRA2β4), which is transcribed from uc 281. It has been shown\nthat aberrant expression of speci ﬁc T-UCRs is associated with\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia, colorectal cancer and hepatocel-\nlular carcinoma. 16,18,19 We previously reported that Hu antigen R\nregulated alternative splicing of TRA2β to selectively produce\nTRA2β4 in human colon cancer cells under oxidative stress. 27\nAlthough TRA2β4 is a PTC variant, transcribed TRA2β4 was retained\npreferentially within the nucleus and resistant to the RNA\nsurveillance NMD. Distinct ncRNAs retained within the mammalian\ncell nucleus are now referred to as nuclear-retained regulatory\nRNAs, and they are suggested to have structural roles or act as\nriboregulators.15,28,29 We suggest here that TRA2β4 may function\nas a novel regulator of senescence in colon cancer cells.\nTra2β is overexpressed in several types of cancers and has been\nsuggested to participate in their abnormal growth. 2,8 In fact, our\nprevious studies showed that Tra2 β knockdown inhibited\nproliferation of colon cancer cells and induced their apoptotic cell\ndeath.9,10 In the present study, we found that TRA2β4 (rather than\nTra2β-encoding TRA2β1) was consistently overexpressed in all\ncolon cancer cell lines tested. Although selective reduction of\nTRA2β4 inhibited cell growth, it did not stimulate apoptosis, but\nfacilitated cellular senescence. These results suggest novel\nfunctions of TRA2β4 distinct from those of Tra2 β protein. Cellular\nsenescence is regulated by multiple factors, including p53, pRb\nand cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p21, p16 INK4a, p14 ARF and\np15INK4b). p16 INK4a is one of the crucial factors for senescence in\nhuman tumors. 30 However, like many other cancer cell lines, the\np16INK4A gene is silenced in HCT116 cells owing to a frameshift\nmutation and the hypermethylated promoter. 22 In contrast,\nTRA2β4 knockdown, but not Tra2 β knockdown, induced p21\nwithout changing p53 expression. The induction of p21 was\nobserved even in p53 − / − HCT116 cells. Upregulation of p21\ninduces senescence and the inactivation of this protein prevents\nsenescence of colon cancer cells. 31,32 Thus, p21 was likely to be\none of the key factors in the TRA2β4 knockdown-induced growth\narrest and senescence of HCT116. Replicative senescence-\ndependent decline of TRA2β4 levels and a reciprocal induction\nof p21 observed in human ﬁbroblast cell lines also support an\nimportant role of TRA2β4 in the regulation of cellular senescence.\nTRA2β4 knockdown could increase p21 levels in a p53-\nindependent manner and it did not change either the stability\nFigure 7. Expression of TRA2β4 in colon cancers. ( a) HCT116 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 (mock), pCMV- TRA2β4 or pCMV- TRA2β4\nmutated in the stem-loop motif (pCMV- TRA2β4mt, 485- AAGG-488) for 48 h. mRNA levels were measured by qPCR using GAPDH as an\nendogenous quantity control. *Signi ﬁcantly decreased compared with mock-treated cells ( Po0.05 by Student ’s t-test). (b) After transfection of\nHCT116 cells (1 × 10 4 cells per 24-well dish) with pcDNA3.1 (mock), pCMV- TRA2β4 or pCMV- TRA2β4mt, the number of growing cells were\nmeasured using CellTiter96 AQueous Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS). Values expressed as means ±s.d. (n =3). *Signiﬁcantly increased compared\nwith mock-transfected cells ( Po0.05 by Student's t-test). ( c) Using human colon cancer tissue qPCR arrays (TissueScan, HCRT103), TRA2β4\nexpressed in cDNAs from adenocarcinomas of the colon and surrounding normal colon tissues were measured by qPCR in 24 patients. Values\nwere normalized to ACTB mRNA levels.\nTRA2β4 represses cancer cell senescence\nK Kajita et al\n8\nOncogenesis (2016), 1 – 11\nor translation rate of CDKN1A mRNA. Based on the results, we\nspeculated that TRA2β4 might directly regulate transcription of the\nCDKN1A gene, and found that TRA2β4 interacted with Sp1 via\nexon 2 and regulated CDKN1A mRNA expression. These results\nsuggest that aberrantly expressed TRA2β4 may prevent Sp1 from\noccupying promoters of target genes, including CDKN1A, and thus\npromote cell survival by interrupting the senescence-related gene\nexpression program. Sp1 is crucial for basal transcription of KLF5,\nDRG2 and PRKRA.24– 26 We con ﬁrmed that TRA2β4 knockdown\nsigniﬁcantly increased the expression of these mRNAs in HCT116\ncells, suggesting that interactions between TRA2β4 and Sp1 may\nbe able to signi ﬁcantly alter the gene expression program.\nAlthough the precise mechanism underlying the function of\nncRNAs remains poorly understood, one emerging theme is the\ninteraction between ncRNAs and protein complexes. 33,34 Several\nncRNAs are required for the precise localization of chromatin\nproteins on genomic DNA targets. 35 ncRNAs can also regulate the\nactivity of protein complexes. An ncRNA upstream of CCND1\n(ncRNACCND1) and the NRON ncRNA can bind to RNA-binding\nproteins or transcription factors and change their activities. 36,37\nDistinct ncRNAs can work as molecular ‘decoys’. For example, the\nGAS5 ncRNA binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, blocking the\ncorrect binding to its regulatory elements. 38 The long ncRNA\nPANDA interacts with the transcription factor NF-YA and limits the\nexpression of proapoptotic genes, leading to apoptosis. 39\nAt present, however, any T-UCR – protein interaction has not been\ndocumented.\nTRA2β exon 2 has four purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers.\nExonic splicing enhancer possesses an activity to retain RNAs in\nthe nucleus through a saturable nuclear retention factor. 40\nFour purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers in TRA2β exon 2 may\nbe important for nuclear retention of TRA2β4 to interact with Sp1\nand other regulatory factors. In addition, RNA secondary\nstructures, especially construction of stems, affected the\nRNA-protein-binding activity. 41 Ultraconserved cDNA segments\nwith AT-rich elements are resistant to secondary structure\nformation, keeping the segments open to allow regulatory factor\nbinding.42 This would explain why Sp1 could bind preferentially to\nAT-rich exon 2 of TRA2β4. TRA2β4 exon 2 contains predictive\nSp1-binding sites (485-GGGG-488 and 515-ACGG-518).\nCentroidFold and M-FOLD programs indicate the presence of a\nstem-loop structure (449 – 488 nt) within exon 2, which includes\none Sp1-binding site (485-GGGG-488). Mutations of this site\n(485-AAGG-488) disrupted the stem-loop structure and eliminated\nthe association between Sp1 and TRA2β4 exon 2. Thus, the\nconsensus Sp1-binding site seems to be crucial for the interaction\nof TRA2β4 exon 2 with Sp1.\nOverexpression of full-length TRA2β4 in HCT116 cells\nsigniﬁcantly reduced CDKN1A mRNA expression and accelerated\ntheir proliferation. The mutations (485- AAGG-488) completely\neliminated these effects, again suggesting a crucial role of the\nconsensus Sp1-binding site in the TRA2β4-mediated control of cell\nfate. Finally, we con ﬁrmed that colon cancer tissues expressed\nsigniﬁcantly higher amounts of TRA2β4.\nThe present study suggests that the TRA2B gene may control\nboth apoptosis and senescence of colon cancer cells by\ngenerating different splice isoforms ( TRA2β1 and TRA2β4).\nTRA2β4 RNA is likely to be a new anti-senescence factor working\nspeciﬁcally in cancer cells. Cellular senescence is one of the\nimportant tumor-suppressive barriers. 30– 32,43 It inhibits tumor cell\nproliferation and suppresses tumor cell motility, indicating that\nthe induction of senescence results in the suppression of tumor\ncell growth, invasion and metastasis. Moreover, TRA2β4\nknockdown could facilitate cellular senescence even in\np53-deﬁcient cells. Thus, TRA2β4 might be a novel tumorigenic\nncRNA and a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell growth, apoptosis and senescence assays\nWild-type and p53 − / − HCT 116 cells were cultured in McCoy ’s 5A medium\n(Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 5% (vol/vol)\nheat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5%\nCO\n2. T84 was maintained in Dulbecco's modi ﬁed Eagle's medium/F-12\n1:1 mixture (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK293T,\nHT29, RKO and CaCo-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modi ﬁed Eagle's\nmedium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human diploid ﬁbroblasts\n(WI-38 and TIG-3) and SW480 cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine\nserum-containing minimum essential medium. For the analysis of cell\ngrowth, appropriate numbers of HCT 116 or HEK293T cells were seeded in\ntissue culture plates, and the number of growing cells was counted using\nan automatic cell counter (Countess; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).\nCell numbers on the plates were also assessed using the CellTiter96\nAQueous Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\nApoptosis was evaluated by measuring cleaved caspase-9 and -3 levels by\nwestern blotting, and TUNEL analysis using the DeadEnd Colorimetric\nTUNEL system (Promega) according to the manufacturer ’s protocol.\nPercentages of TUNEL-positive cells in ﬁve different ﬁelds (400 nm\n2 each)\nwere calculated. The data were obtained in three independent\nexperiments.

Oligonucleotide sequences using Northern blotting\nwere listed in Supplementary Table S1. Samples of total RNA were\nseparated in a 1% agarose gel containing 0.6\nM formaldehyde and\ntransferred to a nylon membrane ﬁlter. After prehybridization, the\nmembrane was hybridized at 60 °C with the 32P-labeled probe overnight.\nAfter washing, bound probes were analyzed by BAS 1500 Image Analyzer\n(Fujiﬁlm, Tokyo, Japan).\nPreparation of nuclear and cytosolic fractions\nAfter HCT116 cells were incubated in cytosolic lysis buffer (10 m M Tris-HCl,\npH 7.4; 100 m M NaCl; 2.5 m M MgCl2;4 0 μg/ml digitonin) for 10 min, lysates\nwere centrifuged at 2060 g for 8 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were\ncollected as cytosolic extracts. The remaining pellets were washed two\ntimes with the cytosolic lysis buffer and lysed with RIPA buffer (10 m\nM\nTris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 m M NaCl; 1 m M EDTA; 1 m M dithiothreitol; 0.1% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate; 1% Nonidet P-40). After centrifugation at 21 000 g for\n10 min at 4 °C, supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. Cells lysed\nwith RIPA buffer were used as whole-cell extracts.\nsiRNAs\nWe used an siRNA (Hs_SFRS10_6 HP validated siRNA; Qiagen, Chatsworth,\nCA, USA) to knock down exon 3-containing TRA2β1 and TRA2β4 mRNAs.\nTo silence selectively TRA2β4, exon 2-targeting siRNA was designed\n(Supplementary Table S1). A negative control siRNA (AllStars Negative\nControl siRNA) was obtained from Qiagen.\nQuantitative real-time reverse transcription – PCR\nTotal RNAs were extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent\n(Life Technologies). One microgram of isolated RNA was reverse-\ntranscribed using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Otsu, Japan).\nTRA2β1, TRA2β4 and CDKNA1 mRNA levels were measured using SYBR\nGreen Master Mix and Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time System (Applied\nBiosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences of primer sets are\nprovided in Supplementary Table S1. TissueScan Tissue qPCR Arrays\n(HCRT103) including cDNAs from paired normal and tumor tissues in 24\npatients with adenocarcinomas of the colon were obtained from OriGene\nTechnologies (Rockville, MD, USA), and TRA2β4 levels in normal and tumor\ntissues were determined by qPCR. TRA2β4 levels were measured by the\ncomparative ΔΔCt method using ACTB mRNA as a control and expressed as\nvalues relative to the normal samples.\nTRA2β4 represses cancer cell senescence\nK Kajita et al\n9\nOncogenesis (2016), 1 – 11\nWestern blotting\nWhole-cell lysates were prepared in a RIPA buffer (10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4;\n1% Nonidet P-40; 1 m M EDTA; 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate; 150 m M NaCl)\ncontaining a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche\nDiagnostics Japan, Tokyo, Japan).

HCT116 cells (1.0 × 10 5) were cultured on\n24-well plates, and then pGL3 luciferase constructs with various\nsite-directed mutation or deletion (100 ng) were co-transfected with\npRL-CMV vector (100 ng) using Jet-PEI (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch,\nFrance). Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were harvested\nand the ﬁreﬂy and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the\nDual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).\nChromatin immunoprecipitation assay\nChromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using the\nChromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).\nBrieﬂy, HCT116 cells were ﬁxed with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-\nbuffered saline for 10 min and then washed two times with ice-cold\nphosphate-buffered saline. These cells were resuspended in sodium\ndodecyl sulfate lysis buffer, incubated for 10 min on ice and then\nsonicated. Immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4 °C using\n3 μg antibody against Sp1. Normal rabbit IgG was used to assess\nnonspeciﬁc reactions.
