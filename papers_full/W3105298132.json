  "abstract": "In this paper, the research methodology and the results of the analysis carried out using the acoustic emission (AE) and thermal imaging for a selected oil power transformer are presented. The basis for the research, by means of the AE method, was the author’s patented research method. The AE descriptor maps on the side walls of the tested transformer along with the location of areas with increased AE activity and an analysis of the properties of AE signals recorded at the measurement points located in these areas have been performed. The results showed no partial discharges that could threaten further operation of the tested transformer as well as three areas where increased magnetoacoustic emission occurred. Thermal imaging studies were carried out in the 7.5 μm &lt; λ &lt; 13 μm band. Three areas were located on the calculated thermograms: the entire upper surface of the transformer tank and two areas on the side walls of the tested transformer in which increased IR radiation occurred. The results of the analysis of the research results for the two methods correspond with each other, having a common part, and complement each other giving a broader description of studied phenomena.",
