Borghi, University of Bologna, Italy\nKeywords: affordance, apraxia, manipulation knowledge, mechanical knowledge, tool use\nUntil recently, most of our understanding\nabout human tool use has come from left\nbrain-damaged patients, particularly those\nwho show difﬁculties in actually using\nfamiliar tools (hereafter referred to as\napraxia of tool use). These difﬁculties have\nbeen suggested to result from impaired\nsensorimotor knowledge about manipula-\ntion (Rothi et al., 1991; Buxbaum, 2001;\nBuxbaum and Kalénine, 2010; Binkofski\nand Buxbaum, 2013). The manipulation\nknowledge hypothesis is very close to the\nstable affordance hypothesis, that is, the\nidea that the mere observation of a tool\nis sufﬁcient to automatically extract sta-\nble affordances, namely, invariant features\nof the tool (i.e., its functional meaning),\nleading to the activation of the canoni-\ncal motor action (e.g., Bub et al., 2008;\nBorghi and Riggio, 2009; Pellicano et al.,\n2011). In this article, I discuss the viability\nof the hypothesis that impaired manipu-\nlation knowledge/stable affordances might\nbe the core deﬁcit of apraxia of tool use.\nManipulation knowledge is supposed\nto contain information about the move-\nments associated with the canonical\nmanipulation of a familiar tool (e.g., for a\nhammer, a broad oscillation of the elbow\njoint; Buxbaum, 2001). This information\nis viewed as egocentric, because it spec-\niﬁes the user-tool relationship. On this\nbasis, a parallel has been drawn between\nthe notions of manipulation knowledge\nand motor affordances (Bub et al., 2008;\nBorghi and Riggio, 2009; Pellicano et al.,\n2011). T o interact with a tool, some infor-\nmation such as the orientation of the tool\nhas to be processed online, because it does\nnot represent a permanent characteris-\ntic. Thus, orientation can be considered\nas an instance of temporary affordance,\nprocessed by the dorso-dorsal stream.\nNevertheless, we also have to determine\nwhat is the typical orientation of a tool\nto use it (e.g., the canonical orienta-\ntion of a book to read it). This typical\norientation would be rather based on\nstable/permanent/canonical affordances,\nsuch as shape and size. These stable affor-\ndances would involve information stored\nin memory and might be processed by\nthe ventral, or more particularly, the\nventro-dorsal stream (see Borghi and\nRiggio, 2009; Ferri et al., 2011; Borghi,\n2012; Myachykov et al., 2013). In sum,\nwhereas the manipulation knowledge\nhypothesis focuses on the motor parame-\nters associated with tool manipulation, the\nstable affordance hypothesis emphasizes\nthe tools’ properties useful for a speciﬁc\nmanipulation. Whatever, both hypotheses\nassume that canonical/permanent/stable\nstored information can be associated with\nthe manipulation of a speciﬁc tool, and is\na potential basis for the conception of tool\nactions1 (Figure 1).\nGrowing evidence indicates that left\nbrain-damaged patients with apraxia of\ntool use are impaired to solve mechanical\nproblems, consisting in selecting among\nseveral novel tools the one appropriate to\nlift a cylinder or to extract a target out from\nab o x(Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998;\n1 In recent years, a distinction has been made between\nvolumetric/structural vs. functional gestures (e.g.,\nBub et al., 2008; Buxbaum and Kalénine, 2010; Jax\nand Buxbaum, 2010). V olumetric/structural gestures\ncorrespond to the hand postures used to grasp an\nobject/tool to move it whereas functional gestures cor-\nrespond to the manipulation of a tool in accordance\nwith its conventional use. This distinction does not\nfully mirror the stable versus temporary affordances\ndistinction because both volumetric/structural and\nfunctional gestures are based on the perception of sta-\nble affordances, such as shape or size. Therefore, I will\nonly focus on stable affordances that can be perceived\nto use tools in a conventional way (i.e., the canonical\nmanipulation of a tool).\nGoldenberg and Hagmann, 1998;\nHartmann et al., 2005; Goldenberg and\nSpatt, 2009; Jarry et al., 2013; Osiurak\net al., 2013;s e ea l s oOsiurak et al., 2009).\nThese difﬁculties are associated neither\nwith a dysexecutive syndrome, nor with\nfrontal lobe damage ( Goldenberg and\nHagmann, 1998; Hartmann et al., 2005;\nGoldenberg et al., 2007; Jarry et al., 2013;\nOsiurak et al., 2013). In other words, the\nability to use both familiar and novel tools\nmight be supported by a common cog-\nnitive process. An important question\nis whether the manipulation knowl-\nedge/stable affordances hypothesis is a\ngood candidate for this common process.\nAt least two theoretical arguments can be\noffered to conclude that the answer is no.\nFirst, manipulation knowledge and sta-\nble affordances are supposed to be associ-\nated with a speciﬁc tool, more particularly\nwith its canonical manipulation. Given\nthat mechanical problems consist of novel\ntools, there is no reason that manipulation\nknowledge supports the solving of these\nproblems. Pellicano et al. (2011)proposed\na somewhat more subtle perspective, by\nassuming that, in some cases, the canon-\nical, familiar tool associated with a usual\naction can be absent (e.g., to stir coffee in\nthe absence of a spoon). In this case, the\nusage context might help the user to select\namong the available tools (e.g., a knife) the\none with the most similar structure to the\ncanonical tool (e.g., a spoon). Again, this\nproposal cannot be applied to the use of\nnovel tools to solve mechanical problems,\ngiven that there is no usual context, and no\ncanonical tool associated with the solution\nof the problem.\nSecond, manipulation knowledge and\nstable affordances are thought to be\negocentric, in that they specify the rela-\ntionship between the user and the tool.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org December 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 890| 1\nHUMAN NEUROSCIENCE\nOsiurak Apraxia of tool use and affordances\nFIGURE 1 | The manipulation knowledge/stable affordances hypothesis (A) and the mechanical knowledge hypothesis (B).\nFor instance, Pellicano et al. (2011,p .\n1) deﬁned stable affordances as “the\npotentiation of motor interactions con-\nsistent with the conventional use of a\nperceived tool. ” The problem is that, to\nsolve mechanical problems, patients have\nto form an allocentric representation of\nthe tool solution (e.g., a hooking action\ninvolves the relationship between a hook\nand something that can be hooked). So at a\ntheoretical level, the manipulation knowl-\nedge/stable affordances hypothesis cannot\nexplain how this allocentric representation\ncan be formed.\nAn alternative to the manipulation\nknowledge/stable affordances hypothesis\ncan be proposed [ Osiurak et al., 2010,\n2011; Osiurak, 2013; for a somewhat sim-\nilar view, see Goldenberg (2013)]. This\nalternative is based on three assumptions.\nFirst, when people intend to use tools,\nthe conception of the tool action is not\nsupported by knowledge about the ego-\ncentric user-tool relationship. Rather, the\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org December 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 890| 2\nOsiurak Apraxia of tool use and affordances\nconception is based on mechanical knowl-\nedge, that is, knowledge about abstract\nmechanical principles, such as hooking,\nlever, and percussion. This knowledge is\nthought to be allocentric, because it speci-\nﬁes the relationship between the different\nelements of the environment. After all,\nonce people understand the lever princi-\nple, they do not need to get a hypothet-\nical, canonical tool to carry out a lever\naction. Instead, they seek among the dif-\nferent “available” tools, which are imme-\ndiately within the workspace or not, the\none appropriate to the present situation.\nSaid differently, this proposal is the inverse\nof what Pellicano et al. (2011)suggested:\nIt is not the representation of the sta-\nble affordances linked to a canonical tool\nthat guides the search of the appropriate\ntool; rather, it is the representation of the\nphysical properties useful for achieving\nthe present goal that guides the search of\nthe appropriate tool, whether the canon-\nical tool is within the workspace or not.\nInterestingly, evidence indicates that the\nventro-dorsal stream supports mechan-\nical knowledge ( Goldenberg and Spatt,\n2009; Goldenberg, 2013). And, impaired\nmechanical knowledge might be the core\ndeﬁcit of apraxia of tool use.\nThis leads me to the second assump-\ntion: The ability to get appropriate tools\nthat are not within the workspace is sup-\nported by what is commonly called seman-\ntic knowledge about tool function (Rothi\net al., 1991; Buxbaum, 2001; Buxbaum\nand Kalénine, 2010). This knowledge spec-\niﬁes the purpose, recipient, and context\nwherein a tool can be used, and is com-\nmonly associated to the ventral stream.\nEvidence indicates that patients with a\nselective semantic deﬁcit are able to actu-\nally use tools, when presented with the\ncorresponding objects (e.g., a hammer\nwith a nail;Buxbaum et al., 1997; Lauro-\nGrotto et al., 1997; Osiurak et al., 2008;\nSilveri and Ciccarelli, 2009 ). However,\nwhen the tool is presented in isolation,\ndifﬁculties can occur, and are strongly\nlinked to the semantic deﬁcit (Sirigu et al.,\n1991; Hodges et al., 2000; Osiurak et al.,\n2008;s e ea l s oLesourd et al., 2013). In\naw a y ,t h o s ep a t i e n t sa r ea b l et od e t e r -\nmine through mechanical reasoning how\nthe tools and objects can be used together.\nHowever, when tools are presented in iso-\nlation, they cannot determine the usual\nuse, because knowledge about the social\nusages is impaired. Thus, those patients\ncan attempt, on the basis of spared\nmechanical knowledge, to show that a key\ncan be used for scrapping the chamfered\nedge of a wooden desk or a nail clip-\nper can be used to attach several sheets\no fp a p e rt o g e t h e r(Sirigu et al., 1991;\nOsiurak et al., 2008 ). In other words,\nsemantic knowledge about tool function\ncan be viewed as another form of allo-\ncentric knowledge, linking the different\ntools and objects with the other tools\nand objects used for the same context or\nusage (Osiurak et al., 2010, 2011). Thus,\nwhen no tool is immediately available (i.e.,\nwithin the workspace) to carry out an\nintended action, semantic knowledge can\nbe requested to “mentally travel” over the\ndifferent semantic categories in search of\na potential appropriate tool. In sum, while\nmechanical knowledge speciﬁes how tools\nand objects work together to carry out\nthe utilization per se,s e m a n t i ck n o w l e d g e\nprovides information about the different\nspaces wherein tools and objects can be\nfound, thereby organizing the search in\nmemory.\nThe third assumption is that the\nperception of affordances (and their actu-\nalization) only aims to translate the rep-\nresentation of the tool action elaborated\nthrough mechanical knowledge (e.g., that\nthe hammer has to make a speciﬁc motion\nto pound a nail) into precise motor pro-\ngrams, linking in an egocentric way the\nuser with the tool. This perspective is con-\nsistent with the ecological approach to per-\nception, which assumes that affordances\nare animal-relative properties of the envi-\nr o n m e n tt h a ta r en o tc r e a t e di nt h ea c t\nof perception, but exist independent of it\n(Gibson, 1979). So people do not system-\natically or automatically perceive all the\naffordances that the environment offers to\nthem, but rather only the affordances that\nare suitable for reaching a current goal\n[Shaw et al., 1982; Shaw, 2003; Osiurak\nand Badets, 2014; for a somewhat similar\nview, see alsoTipper et al. (2006), Pellicano\net al. (2010),a n dEllis et al. (2013)]. In\nother words, the relevant affordances are\ndirectly perceived in accordance with the\ncurrent goal. For instance, among the mul-\ntitude of affordances that a hammer can\noffer, people can perceive it as move-able\nin a vertical plane, when attempting to\npound a nail, but they can also per-\nceive it as throw-able when attempting to\ndefend themselves against attackers. Here,\nthe move-ability and throw-ability of the\nhammer are affordances, but they are per-\nceived only in function of the current\ngoal. In this frame, affordances are nec-\nessarily stable, because they correspond\nto the “negative” of our biomechanical\ncapacities. But, they are also temporary\nbecause they are perceived only in func-\ntion of a speciﬁc goal. In sum, there are no\nstable neither temporary affordances, but\nonly affordances. The corollary is that no\naffordances about the canonical manipu-\nlation of tools can be stored, because they\na r en o te n g a g e di nt h ec o n c e p t i o no ft h e\ntool action per se,b u ta r eo n l yaw a yf o r\npeople to reify the conceptual representa-\ntion of the action into the physical world.\nThis perspective is much more consistent\nwith the idea that the dorso-dorsal stream\nis precisely in charge of perceiving and\nactualizing affordances (see Y oung, 2006;\nFigure 1).\nT o conclude, apraxia of tool use, char-\nacterized by conceptual errors in the use of\ntools, might be not a matter of affordances.\nRather, the perception/actualization of\naffordances would only be involved in\nthe translation of the allocentric, tool\naction representation into speciﬁc, ego-\ncentric sensorimotor actions. In fact, in\nthe ﬁeld of apraxia, the only disorder\nthat might be related to impaired per-\nception/actualization of affordances might\nbe motor apraxia, a disorder affecting\nthe motor coordination mainly of distal\nmovements. Motor apraxia is one of the\nclinical signs of cortico-basal degenera-\ntion (Zadikoff and Lang, 2005). Perhaps,\nan interesting avenue for future research\nwould be to explore how those patients\nperceive affordances as usually assessed by\nthe ecological approach to visual percep-\ntion (e.g.,Carello et al., 1989).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants\nfrom ANR (Agence Nationale pour\nla Recherche; Project Deìmences et\nUtilisation d’Outils/Dementia and T ool\nUse, N\n◦ANR 2011 MALZ 006 03), and\nwas performed within the framework of\nthe LABEX CORTEX (ANR-11-LABX-\n0042) of Universiteì de Lyon, within\nthe program “Investissements d’Avenir”\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org December 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 890| 3\nOsiurak Apraxia of tool use and affordances\n(ANR-11- IDEX-0007) operated by the\nFrench National Research Agency (ANR).\nREFERENCES\nBinkofski, F., and Buxbaum, L.
