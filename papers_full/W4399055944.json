  "abstract": "1. Large language models (LLMs) are gaining importance in research as they offer many benefits. One often overlooked benefit is their potential to facilitate and support interdisciplinary research, which is key to addressing current global challenges, such as the twin crises of biodiversity loss and climate change. 2. LMMs can help reduce the costs associated with knowledge transfer and bridge gaps between different fields of study. They can also be especially useful in helping ecologists understand and adopt significant techniques common in other fields. 3. However, using LLMs in research carries important risks, including the possibility of generating inaccurate information that can lead to false conclusions. 4. We recommend that researchers adhere to best practices when using LMMs for research by providing appropriate prompts and dividing complex tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks that facilitate learning and testing. Additionally, journals could implement policies to ensure that information and code generated using LMMs are properly validated. Moreover, academic programs should incorporate formal training in analytical and programming tools, which will equip researchers in ecology with the necessary skills to use LMMs effectively and responsibly.",
