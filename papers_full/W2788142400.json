    "abstract": "Tables and structured lists on Web pages are a potential source of valuable information, and several methods have been proposed to annotate them with semantics that can be leveraged for search, question answering and information extraction. This paper is concerned with the specific problem of finding and ranking relations from a given Knowledge Graph (KG) that hold over pairs of entities juxtaposed in a table or structured list. The state-of-the-art for this task is to attempt to link the entities mentioned in the table cells to objects in the KG and rank the relations that hold for those linked objects. As a result, these methods are hampered by the incompleteness and uneven coverage in even the best knowledge graphs available today. The alternative described here does not require entity linking, relying instead on ranking relations using generative language models derived from Web-scale corpora. As such, it can produce quality results even when the entities in the table are missing in the KG. The experimental validation, designed to expose the challenges posed by KG incompleteness, shows that our approach is robust and effective in practice.",
