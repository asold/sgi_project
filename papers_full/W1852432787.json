One important reason behind this diﬃculty seems to be\nthat adult learners rely on the rules and categories of their own native language (L1) when learning\nto perceive and produce L2 sounds. Numerous experiments have demonstrated the inﬂuence of L1\nperception and the speciﬁc problems it causes for L2 learners: for instance, troublesome English\nminimal pairs are “rocket” and “locket” for Japanese speakers ( Aoyama et al., 2004), “beat” and\n“\nbit” for Spanish (Flege et al., 1997) and Portuguese (Rauber et al., 2005) speakers, or “bet” and\n“\nbat” for Dutch speakers (Broersma, 2005). The overarching cause of these problems is that these\nvan Leussen and Escudero Modeling second-language perception and recognition\nspeciﬁc sounds do not contrast in these learners’ L1 phoneme\nrepertoires. In other words, novel L2 contrasts are diﬃcult t o\nperceive and produce.\nLinguistic experience is therefore at the core of current\ntheories and models of L2 perception and production, which\nadvance proposals and predictions based on how L1 speech\nsounds compare to those in the new language. Three such\ntheories, the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM;\nBest, 1995 )\nand its extension to L2 learning (PAM-L2; Best and Tyler,\n2007), the Speech Learning model (SLM; Flege, 1995; Flege\net al., 2003 ) and the Second Language Linguistic Perception\nmodel (L2LP; Escudero, 2005, 2009 ) explain how L1 experience\ninﬂuences L2 sound learning in a number of learning scenario s.\nWe sketch three such scenarios and their predicted result in\nL2LP , SLM, and PAM-L2 below. Unlike the other two models\nwhich account for either naïve non-native and beginning L2\nperception (PAM and PAM-L2) or L2 speech learning (SLM), as\nreviewed in\nTyler et al. (2014) , L2LP aims at modeling the entire\ndevelopmental process of L2 speech perception, from naïve,\nnon-native to advanced, native-like performance. L2LP ther efore\nproposes precise learning tasks and developmental trajectorie s\nfor learners, depending on the learning scenario with which\nthey are confronted, and comes with a computational learning\nmodel within the connectionism-inspired learning framewor k of\nStochastic Optimality Theory (\nBoersma, 1998).\nThe basis for all predicted L2 learning trajectories in L2LP\nis the optimal perception hypothesis (Escudero, 2005, 2009 ).\nThis states that learners will initially perceive L2 sounds i n a\nmanner resembling the production of these same sounds in\ntheir L1 environment. The L2LP model thus explicitly represent s\nthe result of L1 acquisition as the initial state of L2 learning,\npredicting that acoustical diﬀerences and similarities betw een\nthe phonemes of two languages will shape development. From\nthis starting point, three scenarios can be distinguished. Un like\nthe SLM which deals with isolated L2 sounds, both the L2LP\nand PAM make predictions for the perceptual development of\nsound contrasts. When the majority of productions of an L2\ncontrast are acoustically closest to typical or average produ ctions\nof a single L1 sound, learners face what L2LP calls a NEW\nscenario and PAM calls single category assimilation(\nBest, 1995 ).\nLearners facing this scenario must either create a new L2\ncategory or split their existing single L1 category. L2LP and PAM\npredict that this is a diﬃcult scenario for L2 learners, and th e\nexperimental studies cited above conﬁrm this. In contrast, w hen\nthe majority of the tokens of an L2 contrast are acoustically\nclosest to the typical productions of two separate L1 sounds,\nlearners are faced with a SIMILAR scenario (PAM: two-category\nassimilation). According to the L2LP , in this scenario, the\nexisting L1 categories are simply replicated and then adjuste d\nso that their boundaries will come to match those of the\nL2 contrast, as there is hardly ever a perfect match between\nthe productions of an L1 and L2 contrast. PAM and L2LP\npredict that this shifting is less problematic than creating n ew\ncategories (\nEscudero et al., 2014 ), while Flege’s SLM predicts\nthat new sounds would be easier to learn than similar or old\nsounds (\nFlege, 1995 ). However, since the SLM focuses on single\nsounds and not on sound contrasts, as the PAM and L2LP\nmodels, a comparison of predictions across models may not be\nstraightforward.\nA third possible case only considered by the L2LP and PAM\nis the SUBSET scenario, which may be comparable to what is\ncalled uncategorized or categorized-uncategorized assimilation,\ndepending on how each of the members of the contrast are\nassimilated to native categories, in PAM. It takes place when\na single non-native sound is perceived as more than one L1\ncategory, so-called multiple category assimilation within the\nL2LP (\nEscudero and Boersma, 2002; Escudero, 2005 ). Both the\nPAM and L2LP models predict that this scenario poses fewer\nproblems than the NEW scenario, since no new contrast has\nto be created in L2 perception (L2LP) and little discrimination\ndiﬃculty is predicted (PAM). Given that the PAM and PAM–\nL2 use perceptual assimilation data to make predictions for\ndiscrimination accuracy, while they do not predict assimilat ion\npatterns (\nEscudero et al., 2014; Tyler et al., 2014; Colantoni\net al., 2015 , Chapter 2), these models would predict little\ndiscrimination diﬃculty for Dutch learners of Spanish from\nEscudero and Boersma’s (2002) categorization pattern. This is\nbecause as reported in Escudero and Boersma (2002, Table 1),\nDutch listeners perceived Spanish /i/ mostly as Dutch /i/ (in\naverage 71% of 25 tokens) and Spanish /e/ mostly as Dutch / I/ (in\naverage 65% of 25 tokens), which according to PAM would lead\nto a two-category assimilation or a category-goodness scen ario1,\nresulting in very good to good discrimination. However, L2L P’s\narchitecture allows pinpointing a potential diﬃculty for lear ners\nin this scenario that goes beyond discrimination diﬃculty:\nEscudero and Boersma (2002) note that if a learner’s L1 contrasts\nare left intact when acquiring an L2 without this contrast, t his\nmay in turn lead to spurious contrasts at the word level (i.e.,\nlexical contrasts), ultimately hampering the attainment of a fully\nnative-like command of the L2.\nIf the purpose of speech communication is to understand and\nto be understood, it seems important to not only concentrate\non how perceptual development takes place in an L2 but also to\nexamine how the novel L2 categories are employed to recognize\nand store new words in the L2 lexicon. Experimental evidence\nsuggests continuity between L2 perceptual and lexical abilit ies,\nas diﬃculties in distinguishing novel L2 sounds are commonly\naccompanied by diﬃculties in distinguishing L2 minimal pairs.\nHowever, other research has shown dissociation between\nperceptual and lexical abilities in L2 development. For instan ce,\nsome studies document that L2 learners fail to encode a novel\nL2 contrast lexically, despite them being fully able to percei ve\nthe L2 contrast (e.g.,\nCurtin et al., 1998 ), while other studies\nshow that the opposite can also be true: L2 learners may develop\ndistinct lexical representations for words that they cannot reliably\ndiscriminate in perception (\nWeber and Cutler, 2004; Cutler\net al., 2006; Escudero et al., 2008 ) or production ( Hayes-Harb\n1Escudero and Boersma (2002) did not collect goodness of ﬁt ratings together with\nL1 categorization, which is crucial for establishing the percept ual assimilation types\nproposed within PAM, which are the start point for the model’s discrimin ation\ndiﬃculty predictions. However, following Bundgaard-Nielsen et al. (2011) , one can\nconclude that Spanish /i/-/e/ are categorized or assimilated to th e Dutch contrast\n/i/-/I/, given that an L2 vowel is deﬁned as categorized if it was identiﬁed as an L1\nvowel in more than 50% of presentations.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 August 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 1000\nvan Leussen and Escudero Modeling second-language perception and recognition\nand Masuda, 2008 ). These studies suggest that distinguishing\npre-lexical perception from lexical recognition in an L2 model\nwill provide further insight into the processes underlying L2\nacquisition. By incorporating separate but linked representa tions\nfor perceptual and lexical contrast, L2LP can serve as a model to\ninvestigate both continuity and discrepancy between perceptu al\nand lexical abilities in L2 acquisition.\nThe computational architecture of L2LP allows simulating\nthe entire trajectory from naïve to experienced L2 listener i n\nvarious scenarios. These trajectories can then be compared t o\nempirical data to assess the adequacy of the model.\nEscudero\nand Boersma (2004) and Escudero (2009) performed simulations\nwith computer-modeled learners in the L2LP framework,\nshowing that these exhibited developmental paths that are\ncomparable to the performance of Spanish learners of the\nSouthern British (SBE) and Scottish English (SE) /i/ −/I/ contrast.\nThese learners face a NEW and SIMILAR scenario respectively, as\nexemplars of the vowels in SBE are acoustically closest to Span ish\n/i/, while exemplars of SE are acoustically closest to /i/ and /e/.\nHowever, the modeled learners in these studies had direct ac cess\nto the phonemic or phonological categories of the L2 in the input\ndata.\nEscudero (2005) argues that ultimately L2 learning should\nbe modeled as meaning-driven or message-driven2: learners have\nno direct access to the phonological categories employed by\nnative speakers of the L2, but rather infer these based on how w ell\nthey are able to understand the meaning intended by a speaker.\nThis is, in fact, a more ecologically valid proposal. Escudero ’s\ntheoretical account of this more realistic mechanism for la nguage\nlearning used the SUBSET scenario for Dutch learners of the\nSpanish /i/-/e/ contrast as a case study. Dutch has three fron t\nvowels /i/, / I/, and /ε/ in the area of the vowel space where Spanish\nhas only /i/ and /e/, which according to the L2LP should lead t o\nthe multi-category assimilation of Spanish /i/ as Dutch /i/ a nd\n/I/ and Spanish /e/ as Dutch / I/ and / ε/, which was conﬁrmed in\nin naïve, beginning, intermediate, and advanced Dutch lear ners\nof Spanish (\nEscudero and Boersma, 2002 ). The theoretical\naccount predicted that meaning-driven learning would resul t in\na reduction of the middle / I/ category. However, a computational\nimplementation of the model by Weiand (2007) failed to conﬁrm\nthis hypothesis, as the modeled learners mostly did not manag e to\nconverge on a more L2-like grammar. A thorough inspection of\nWeiand’s results has led us to believe that by revising some d etails\nof learning and representation in the model, meaning-driven\ncategory reduction could be borne out.\nIn the present study, we further investigate the adequacy\nof the L2LP model, in its theoretical proposal (\nEscudero,\n2005) and earlier computational implementations ( Escudero and\nBoersma, 2004; Weiand, 2007; Boersma and Escudero, 2008 ),\nfor explaining a case of perception and lexicalization of an\nL2 contrast. Although PAM-L2 incorporates the role of the\nlexicon in L2 sound perception, it is limited to hypothesizing\nthat vocabulary size determines L2 sound perception success.\nCurrent psycholinguistic models of spoken-word recognition\n2Escudero (2005) ’s original proposal considered learning message-driven , but as\nthe learning data for the model described in sections §2 and §3 do not strictly\ncontain messages, we use the term meaning-driven here.\n(e.g., McClelland and Elman, 1986; Norris, 1994; Gaskell and\nMarslen-Wilson, 1997 ) assume that the process of identifying\na word in the lexicon is the result of a process of competition\nbetween lexical candidates that are activated at the same\ntime, with each candidate being supported to diﬀerent degrees\nby the speech signal. L2LP uses this activation process in\na network-like model. Another important feature of L2LP\nthat is compatible with a number of L1 acquisition models\n(e.g., PRIMIR,\nWerker and Curtin, 2005 ) is the assumption\nof continuity between perceptual and lexical development:\nperceptual learning is triggered as learners attempt to improve\nrecognition by updating their lexical representations. This\ntrickle-down view of meaning-driven lexical learningand lexicon-\ndriven perceptual learningwill be detailed below. In short, L2LP\nbridges insights from the ﬁeld of L2 sound acquisition with\nmore general cognitive theories of linguistic processing. Th ese\nconcepts are embedded in a simulation framework that is capabl e\nof generating quite speciﬁc predictions for various acquisit ion\nscenarios.\nThe present study has two aims. First, we present a revised\nversion of L2LP , changing two crucial details of how learnin g\ntakes place but retaining the fundamental properties of the\nmodel listed above. We assess the explanatory adequacy of thi s\nrevised L2LP by re-applying it to an instance of lexical and\nperceptual learning in the Dutch-to-Spanish SUBSET scenario\ndescribed above. Our hypothesis is that the revisions will im prove\nthe L2LP’s ability to model the learning process in a multiple-\ncategory assimilation case followed by a SUBSET scenario, as\nobserved in real L2 learners by\nEscudero and Boersma (2002) .\nSecond, we propose two alternative versions of the revised\nmodel with regards to information ﬂow from speech signal to\nlexicon, given that pre-lexical and lexical perception can be\nimplemented as sequential (strictly bottom-up) or interactive\n(allowing lexical feedback to lower-level perception). The\nexistence of lexical feedback is a matter of much debate with in\nmodels of psycholinguistics, as shown by\nNorris et al.’s (2000)\nproposal and the many alternatives that emerged in response\nMcClelland et al., 2006; McQueen et al., 2006 . In Escudero\n(2005)’s account, L2 comprehension is described as sequential,\nbut this is not a necessary property of the model. We will\nthus contribute to this more general debate by investigatin g the\nexplanatory adequacy of these alternative views on processin g\ngrammars in L2 speech comprehension. Below, we present our\nrevised version of the L2LP model and its speciﬁc application\nto the SUBSET scenario, and demonstrate that it successfully\nexplains L2 learning of perception and lexicalization.\nThe L2LP Model Revised\nEscudero’s (2005) L2LP model aims at providing a\ncomprehensive platform to explain L2 acquisition, perception,\nand lexicalization. It grew out of, and co-evolved with, the\nBidirectional Phonetics and Phonology framework (\nBoersma,\n1998, 2011 ; henceforth BiPhon), which itself is an extension of\nOptimality Theory (OT; Prince and Smolensky, 1993 ). In this\nsection, we describe how linguistic knowledge, processing, a nd\nlearning are implemented in a revised version of L2LP , taking\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 August 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 1000\nvan Leussen and Escudero Modeling second-language perception and recognition\nFIGURE 1 | The levels of representation and connection types in the\nL2LP model.\ncare to highlight changes from Escudero (2005)’s description and\nWeiand (2007)’s implementation.\nArchitecture of the L2LP-revised: Levels and\nConnections\nLike its predecessors, L2LP is an explicit computational model\nof the processes driving L2 perception and learning. Modeling\nthe acquisition of pre-lexical phonetic categorization in th e L2,\nas well as the subsequent recognition of L2 categories in sto red\nlexical items, requires units on four levels of representati on.\nFigure 1 shows an overview of these four levels and the\nconnections between them.\nAt the bottom we ﬁnd the acoustic level, representing\nincoming speech sounds as they arrive in the peripheral auditor y\nsystem. The subsequent phonetic level encodes a speaker’s\nlanguage-speciﬁc, invariant representations of speech sound s,\nincluding context-speciﬁc allophonic detail. These interme diate\nrepresentations are linked to the phonemic level where possible\ncanonical forms of words/morphemes are stored, encoding onl y\ncontrasts that may change the meaning of a word. Finally,\nphonemic forms connect to possible meanings at the lexical\nlevel 3. By including an intermediate phonetic level between the\nacoustic signal and phonemic forms stored in the lexicon, L2L P\naims to explicitly represent the distinction between the pre-l exical\nand lexical stages of speech perception, as was described in the\nIntroduction.\nUnits on adjacent levels are connected, and the process\nof perceiving and eventually recognizing an incoming word\nis represented in the model as a four-step path through this\nnetwork: [acoustic] → /phonetic/ → |phonemic| → <lexical>.\nThe winning or optimal path is decided by relative strength of\nconnections among competing paths. While the units themselve s\nare ﬁxed, the strengths of the connections are altered over\nthe course of learning. This in turn alters the optimal paths\nfrom acoustics to lexicon through the network. Knowledge\nof a language is thus stored in the connection strengths:\nfor instance, a strong |phonemic| → <lexical> connection\nencodes knowledge of a given lexical item as a meaning-form\npair.\n3Traditionally in BiPhon and L2LP these four levels are known as Auditory,\nSurface, Underlying, and Lexical Form, respectively. Here we replace these\nphonological concepts with terms more familiar to psychologists and\npsycholinguists.\nFIGURE 2 | Possible mappings for the input [t SVka; F1(V) = 4 Bark], via\nphonetic and phonemic representations, to a lexical form. Each\nbottom-to-top path through the graph represents a possible pathway of\nperception and recognition.\nA central assumption of L2LP is the Full Copying hypothesis\n(Escudero, 2005 ): L2 learners initiate their learning process on a\nduplicate or copy of their L1 perception grammar, so that their\nL2 grammar is attuned to the sounds and categories of the L1.\nOver time, exposure to the new language shifts the connection s of\nthis copy to a state more suited to perception and recognition of\nthe L2. The next sections elaborate this learning process, sh owing\nhow perception, recognition, and learning are modeled in the\nDutch to Spanish SUBSET scenario that is the focus of this paper.\nEvaluating Optimal Paths\nAn incoming word is represented as a unit on the [acoustic] lev el.\nAs this study concerns the L2 acquisition of Spanish front vowels,\ninputs are represented by two variables, namely a “carrier” wor d\ncontaining a front vowel, and the ﬁrst formant (F1) of the sai d\nvowel, which is the acoustic cue for vowel height. The carrie r\nwords (see Appendix) are always members of a Spanish /i/-/e/\nminimal pair, and are represented as acoustically invariant: they\ncan be seen as narrowing down the available units in the netwo rk\nto those speciﬁc to a given minimal pair. The F1 input values do\nshow acoustic variation: they are represented as discretize d values\non the psychoacoustic Bark scale, ranging from 2 to 8 Bark in\nsteps of 0.1 Bark. For example, the acoustic input [t SVka, F1(V) =\n4.0 Bark] corresponds to a realization of either the Spanish wo rd\nchica “girl” or of checa “Czech female, ” with an F1 value of 4 Bark\nfor the front vowel (V). Figure 2 shows the possible mappings\nfrom this particular input form, via phonetic and phonemic\nrepresentations, to one of two possible lexical meanings. All\nother combinations of carrier words and front vowel realiza tions\nare similarly connected to two possible meanings via the two\nintermediate levels of representation.\nUnder the assumption that the L2 grammar is initially a\ncopy of the L1 grammar, the learner may connect the [V]\ncontained in the acoustic input to one of the three diﬀerent\nfront vowels of Dutch on the /phonetic/ level, embedded in\na phonetic representation of the carrier word. Our example\ninput [t SVka, F1(V) = 4.0 Bark] thus connects to the phonetic\nrepresentations /tSika/, /tS Ika/ and /t Sεka/.

This yields a total of 18 paths (3 × 3 × 2)\nfrom acoustics to lexicon for each representable acoustic in put.\nThe relative strengths of connections along the paths decide\nthe optimal route. However, the ranking values encoding these\nconnection strengths are distorted slightly at each evalua tion\nstep by adding a random value from a normal distribution. Thi s\nstochastic evaluation (\nBoersma, 1998 ) allows the model to deal\nwith probability and variation when mapping from input to\noutput. Stochastic evaluation is also robust to occasional e rrors\nin the input data during the learning procedure (detailed in\nSection Meaning-driven Learning below), making it more like ly\nto converge on a target language (\nBoersma and Hayes, 2001 ).\nFollowing a central tenet of Optimality Theory, the optimal\npath from [acoustic] to <lexical> is not deﬁned by the sum of\nits connection strengths. Rather, a path is as strong as its we akest\nlink, which means that the optimal path is the one containing th e\nleast weak connections. Equivalently, one can envision eva luation\nas iterating through the connections from weakest to strong est,\npruning each connection until a single route remains. Figure 3\nillustrates this evaluation procedure and is further explain ed\nbelow.\nThe [acoustic]-/phonetic/ connection strengths are initia lly\ninherited from the L1 Dutch grammar and thus suitable for\nthe Dutch system with three front vowels. The /phonetic/ →\n|phonemic| connections are also not arbitrary, as the gramma r\nis biased toward what phonologists refer to as faithful mappings,\ni.e., the connections between a phonetic representation and i ts\n“identical” phonological counterpart (e.g., /i/ → |i|, /I/ → |I| and\n/ε/ → |ε|). The bias is enforced by initializing these connections\nas stronger than the other six /phonetic/ → |phonemic|\nconnections. Nevertheless, this is an important conceptual s hift\nfrom the original architecture proposed by\nEscudero (2005) and\nits implementation by Weiand (2007). While they also biased the\ngrammars toward faithful mappings, this bias was qualitative, so\nthat these connections could never be weaker than a non-fait hful\nmapping, and their strength was impervious to learning. In the\nrevised L2LP , this initial bias is quantitative and may diminish\nor vanish over the course of learning. Thus, our revision ret ains\nFIGURE 3 | Recognizing a lexical form by ﬁnding an optimal path. Of\nthe 18 possible routes from sound to meaning, the optimal pat h is that whose\nweakest connection is stronger than the weakest connection of any other\npath. In this ﬁgure, line thickness visualizes connection str ength. The input\ncontaining a front vowel with an F1 of 4 Bark is perceived as ph onetic /t Sika/,\nphonemic |t Sika|, and ultimately recognized as lexical <girl>.\nsymbolic representations but has a connectionist perspective on\nthe relation between the /phonetic/ and |phonemic| levels: th e\ntwo types of representation are of a distinct nature, there is no\nidentity mapping, and the aﬃnities between units on the two\nlevels are gradual.\nFinally, the |phonemic| → <lexical> connections are\nall initialized at equal strength in the L2 grammar, since\nno knowledge about the lexical meaning of Spanish word\nforms could be inherited from the L1 grammar. While\n|phonemic| → <lexical> mappings are speciﬁc to the\nsubnetworks selected by the carrier words, the [acoustic] →\n/phonetic/ and /phonetic/ → |phonemic| connection strengths\npertain only to the representations of front vowels and are\nshared between representations regardless of carrier word. An\nupdate triggered by our example acoustic input [t SVka, F1(V) =\n4.0 Bark] will therefore also aﬀect the outcome of all other\ninputs with an F1 of 4 Bark; at the same time the updating\nof |phonemic| → <lexical> connection strengths aﬀects the\noutcome for the carrier word [t SVka] across all F1 input values.\nThis update to both levels of connections triggered by an acou stic\ninput validates the need for both a phonemic and a lexical level\nwithin the model.\nSequential vs. Interactive Processing\nAs discussed in the Introduction, a standing debate in cogni tive\nmodels of speech processing is whether the outcome of (pre-\nlexical) perception forms the input to recognition, or whether the\ntwo processes are performed in parallel and may interact with\none another.\nEscudero (2005)’s theoretical treatment of L2LP and\nits implementation by Weiand (2007) is sequential: their learners\nalways evaluate the [acoustic] → /phonetic/ connections of\nperception before the /phonetic/ → |phonemic| and |phonemic|\n→ <lexical> connections of recognition. However, this two-\nstep processing is not a necessary feature of the model, as\nBoersma (2011) shows that BiPhon (and by extension L2LP)\ncan handle interaction between diﬀerent levels of representa tion.\nBy removing the strict ordering of connections in evaluatio n,\nrecognition may interact with perception.\nIn our implementation, assigning connections stratum indices\nbesides their ranking value enforces strict sequential ord ering.\nAt evaluation time, connections are ordered ﬁrst by stratum ,\nthen by (distorted) ranking value. This means that if we place\nthe [acoustic] → /phonetic/ connections in a higher stratum,\nperception precedes recognition and we simulate a learner with\nsequential perception and recognition. Conversely, by placin g all\nconnections in the same stratum, the connections of recogni tion\nmay inﬂuence the outcome of perception. This allows us to\ncompare a purely bottom-up version to an interactive version of\nthe model, all else being equal.\nMeaning-driven Learning\nLearning in the L2LP framework equates with updating\nthe connection strengths in the network, and is error-\ndriven: simulated learners attempt to improve perception and\nrecognition of the L2 whenever the current state of the gramm ar\nleads to misunderstandings. This is referred to as meaning- driven\nlearning, as described above. After an acoustic input is eval uated\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 August 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 1000\nvan Leussen and Escudero Modeling second-language perception and recognition\nand matched to a lexical form (Section Evaluating Optimal\nPaths), the learner is presented with a target <lexical> form\nencoding the intention of the speaker. If this target form mat ches\nthe lexical form as understood by the learner, recognition i s\ncorrect and no action is undertaken. In case of a mismatch,\nthe learner will attempt to decrease the likelihood of a futur e\nmismatch by updating their grammar through weakening all\nconnections along the path that led to the incorrect lexical f orm,\nand strengthening all connections along the path to the inten ded\ntarget form. If the two paths share subpaths, the net change in\nthe strength of that connection will be zero. The plasticity value\nthat is subtracted and added in order to weaken and strengthe n\nconnections, respectively, gradually decreases during lea rning.\nImportantly, the target <lexical> item presented to learners\ncontains no information on the /phonetic/ or |phonemic|\ncategories employed by the speaker. The connection strengths\non these intermediate levels must be updated such that future\ninstances of this acoustic input will follow a path to the inten ded\ntarget item. Although the use of minimal pairs restricts possi ble\noutputs to two <lexical> items, the learner is confronted with\nseveral possibilities for performing this update, and is initi ally\nbiased toward retaining its three-vowel L1 Dutch system whe re\npossible.\nSince nine distinct paths lead from any input to each\nindividual lexical form, the learner must ﬁrst parse a single path\nto the correct form to decide which connections to strengthe n.\nFinding this parse occurs through interpretive parsing(\nTesar and\nSmolensky, 1998). That is, the learner uses its current grammar to\nﬁnd an alternative path, but this time considers only the subs et of\nnine paths leading to the target form, instead of the full netw ork,\nas shown in Figure 4. Following Jarosz (2013) , and departing\nfrom the implementation of Weiand (2007) , evaluation noise\nis re-applied to the connections prior to parsing. Jarosz found\nthat this “resampling” technique greatly increases the chan ces\nof ﬁnding a grammar that is compatible with the input data in\nOptimality-Theoretic, error-driven learning models.\nTo summarize, the present L2LP-revised model implements\nEscudero (2005) ’s proposal with the following three revisions:\n(1) the phonologically inspired bias for “faithful” mappings\nis less restrictive (Section Evaluating Optimal Paths), (2) the\npossibility of interaction between perception and recognitio n can\nFIGURE 4 | Error-driven learning. The learner discovers that it should have\nrecognized lexical <Czech.F> rather than <girl>. It performs another\nevaluation, this time within the subset of paths leading to <Czech.F>.\nLearning strengthens connections along that path, and weak ens connections\nalong the incorrect path initially found.\nbe explored (Section Sequential Vs. Interactive Processing ), and\n(3) Jarosz (2013) ’s resampling is applied in parsing to enhance\nthe likelihood of convergence. The next section describes t he\nmethodology for training and testing our model of the SUBSET\nscenario using computational simulations.\nComputational Modeling with the\nL2LP-revised Model\nWe performed a number of learning simulations to investigate\nwhether the revised model described in Section The L2LP\nModel Revised can successfully implement the meaning-driven\nSUBSET learning scenario described by\nEscudero (2005) . The\nsimulation program consisted of two phases: L1 training, in order\nto create the “naïve” L1 starting point from which L2 acquisit ion\nproceeds, and L2 trainingto simulate the acquisition of Spanish\ncategories through error-driven learning on lexical items. This\ntwo-stage simulation procedure was applied both for sequential -\ntype learners whose [acoustic]-/phonetic/ connections are a lways\nevaluated before all other connections, and for interactive -type\nlearners whose connections pertaining to recognition are al lowed\nto outrank connections pertaining to perception. At various\npoints during both training procedures, learners were given d ata\nfrom a test set in order to investigate to what extent L2 train ing\nimproves recognition of the Spanish lexical items, as well as how\nphonemic/phonetic categories were remapped to this end.\nParameter settings were identical to those used in\nBoersma\nand Escudero (2008) and Weiand (2007) wherever possible.\nRanking values (strength) for all connections were initialized\nto an equal value of 100, with the exception of /phonetic/-\n|phonemic| connections, which were set to 95 for “faithful”\nconnections that preserved identity across these levels (Se ction\nEvaluating Optimal Paths), and to 105 for the other connectio ns.\nThe evaluation noiseparameter was set to 2.0, which represented\nthe standard deviation of a random normal distribution\n(centered around zero) that distorted ranking values before each\nevaluation. Plasticity was initialized to 0.1 at the start of learning,\nwith a decay ratesuch that plasticity shrank by a factor 0.7 every\n10,000 steps.\nAcoustic Input Data for the Simulated Learners\nIn both training phases, simulated learners were repeatedly g iven\n[acoustic] inputs, each of which represented some word or\nutterance containing a front vowel. The auditory correlate of the\nheight of these front vowels is its ﬁrst formant (F1), which the\ngrammar represents on the psychoacoustic Bark scale, from 2.0\nto 8.0 Bark in bins of 0.1 Bark. In order to increase the ecolog ical\nvalidity of our simulations, we obtained these F1 values fro m\ntwo recent, methodologically similar vowel production stud ies,\nas described below.\nThe F1 values for the L1 Dutch input data were generated\nby taking all female tokens of the vowels /i/, / I/, and / ε/ from\nthe corpus of\nvan Leussen et al. (2011) , converting the F1 of\nthese tokens to Bark and rounding it to the nearest “bin.” The\nL2 formant values were likewise generated by taking all fema le\ntokens of /i/ and /e/ from\nChládková et al. (2011) , but these were\nalso paired with a randomly selected carrier word containing\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 August 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 1000\nvan Leussen and Escudero Modeling second-language perception and recognition\neither /i/ or /e/ in Spanish. Carrier words were the minimal pai rs\nlisted in the Appendix, which were the same as those used in\nWeiand (2007).\nFigure 5 shows the distribution of the F1 per category in the\nL1 and L2 input data.\nTraining and Testing Procedures\nIn the L1 Dutch training phase, simulated learners were expose d\nto [acoustic] ∼ /phonetic/ pairs of binned input F1 values\nand target vowels, in order to train them directly on the\nthree-way Dutch contrast. In this way, we cast L1 learning as\nperceptual, as in\nBoersma and Escudero (2008) . This special\nstatus for L1 learning is warranted by results in the infant\nlearning literature, which strongly suggest that infants l earn\nlanguage-speciﬁc perceptual warping before a lexicon is in place\n(\nWerker and Tees, 1984; Polka and Werker, 1994; Maye et al.,\n2002). An example input-output pair would be [F1 = 3.4\nBark] ∼ /i/. To test whether training resulted in correct Dutch-\nlike perception of /i/, / I/, and / ε/, we used a holdout method\nwhere the production tokens described in Section Acoustic\nInput Data for the Simulated Learners were ﬁrst split into\na training (90%) and testing (10%) subset. A total of 40,000\n[acoustic] input tokens was then randomly sampled from these\ntraining sets for each learner, with the grammar updating the\nranking in case of an error as described in Section Sequentia l\nvs. Interactive Processing. Following\nJarosz (2013) , the ranking\nwas resampled (i.e., evaluation noise was applied a second\ntime) after an error, so that the connection strengths used\nfor parsing may diﬀer slightly from those used for the initial\nevaluation.\nFIGURE 5 | Distribution of input data over the F1 continuum for Dutch\n(above) and Spanish training phases. The histograms represent the\n“binned” input data.\nTo simulate immersion in the L2 environment, the simulated\nlearners were next trained on labeled pairs of binned input\nF1 values plus invariant carrier words (Section Acoustic Inpu t\nData for the Simulated Learners), and output <lexical> forms\nrepresenting a meaning congruent with the chosen carrier wor d\nand vowel token. An example input-output pair would be\n[tSVka], F1(V) = 3.8 Bark] ∼ <girl>. Learners were given no\ninformation about the intermediate /phonetic/ and |phonemic |\ncategories; remapping these representations takes place only o n\nthe basis of the target <lexical> form through the parsing\nstrategy described in Section Meaning-driven Learning, and\nlearners began with a system optimally suited to perceiving th e\nL1 training data.\nIn all other respects, L2 training resembles L1 training: aga in\nthe input data were split into a training (90%) and testing (10%)\nsubset, and a total of 40,000 training tokens (generated fro m\nthe training data) was given to learners, who again employed\nresampling to determine which ranking values to update in case\nof an error.

No learning took place on\nthese test tokens. Since there are some elements of randomne ss\nin the model and training (speciﬁcally in the division of the\ninput data into training and test sets, and the noise employed in\nevaluation), we ran 50 simulations for both the sequential a nd\ninteractive versions of the grammar, representing 50 simula ted\nsequential-type and 50 simulated interactive-type learners . The\nresults reported here are averaged over these 50 simulated\nlearners per grammar type.\nL1 Learning\nAs stated above, L2LP assumes the initial state of an L2\ngrammar to be a copy of the L1 grammar. We simulated this\ninitial state by ﬁrst training each grammar on the discretiz ed\nacoustic values coupled to the phonetic categories mentioned\nabove. Since the L1 training concerns only the mapping from\n[acoustic] inputs to the /phonetic/ level, without involving\nthe lexicon, there is no diﬀerence in behavior between the\nsequential and interactive learners. Figure 6 shows how these\n[acoustic]-/phonetic/ mappings develop over the course of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 August 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 1000\nvan Leussen and Escudero Modeling second-language perception and recognition\nFIGURE 6 | Classiﬁcation of inputs after 0 (left) and 40,000 (ri ght) learning iterations on the L1 input data.\ntraining. At the end of training, the categorization curves\nmatched those of the input distribution of Figure 5. Since the\ndistributions of the three vowels on the F1 continuum show\nsome overlap, learners reached a ceiling of about 80% correct\nrecognition of the test set ( Figure 7, left). This means that\nwithout lexical or semantic context, it is not always possible to\ndistinguish these vowels from one another.\nL2 Learning\nBoth sequential and interactive learners were able to improv e\ntheir classiﬁcation of the Spanish minimal <lexical> pairs,\narriving at a stable recognition rate of around 85% over time .\nAs in L1 learning, this is probably the peak possible success rate\ngiven the fact that the distributions of Spanish /i/ and /e/ ov erlap,\nas shown in the original vowel production study (see\nChládková\net al., 2011 and Figure 5). Although sequential learners needed a\nslightly larger number of input data to attain this peak rate, b oth\ntypes ultimately reach this ceiling (with overlapping conﬁdenc e\nintervals) after about 8000 iterations, as shown in Figure 7\n(right). This slower attainment may be a consequence of the m ore\nL1-like representations maintained by sequential learners , as will\nbe discussed below.\nThe success of this new implementation of the model in\nlearning to recognize the L2 conﬁrms our hypothesis that\nthe original L2LP’s predictions as implemented by\nWeiand\n(2007) failed because of the phonologically inspired “faithfulness ”\nconnections. The current revision, which implements phoneti c-\nphonemic mappings through a more general concept of\n“connection strength, ” is more successful in modeling empiri cal\nL2 learning results. The revised L2LP furthermore shows tha t the\nmeaning-driven learning of lexical items proposed by\nEscudero\n(2005) can account for improved understanding of the L2\nthrough exposure to the language.\nFurthermore, the L2LP model makes speciﬁc predictions\non learners’ phonological categorization of speech sounds ov er\nthe course of development. All learners shifted the boundari es\nbetween /phonetic/ categories during learning: they adapted to\nthe two-vowel L2 system at the cost of the middle / I/ category,\nas shown by the /phonetic/ categorization of learners over ti me\n(Figure 8). This result of the simulations closely resembles the\nempirical ﬁndings of Escudero and Boersma (2002) , as well as\nthe modeling results of Boersma and Escudero (2008) , which\nassumed learners access category labels. The revised model\nhowever shows that acquiring L2-like representations can also\nbe modeled as meaning-driven, without assuming that a learner\nhas explicit knowledge of the L2 phonological categories, an\nassumption that was at the core of\nBoersma and Escudero’s (2008)\nmodel.\nWithout phonetic or phonemic labels in the L2 input data,\nlearners are faced with several options on how to adapt their\nold perceptual systems to the L2. Interestingly, Figure 8 also\nshows that the sequential and interactive versions of the mo del\ndo not predict the same extent of perceptual remapping in\nthe L2. For interactive learners, the former Dutch / I/ category\neventually falls into complete disuse, so that these L2 Spanish\nlearners are eﬀectively native-like in their perception of front\nvowels, employing only two categories. The sequential model\npredicts that perception of / I/ diminishes, but is retained for\ncertain inputs. This diﬀerence in / I/ responses after learning,\ncorresponding to the area under the / I/ curve after 40,000 training\ntokens, is signiﬁcant between the two groups of learners 4.\nThis diﬀerence between the two groups is restricted to a\nsmall range of inputs: the phonemic categorizations of the two\ngroups are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for [acoustic] inputs whose\nF1 lies between 4.5 and 5.1 Bark. 5 This range corresponds to\nDutch /I/ and includes the boundary between Spanish /i/ and /e/.\nThe sequential model thus predicts that L2 perception remains\nﬁltered by the L1 for these intermediate vowels, with more open\nvowels usually classiﬁed as /e/ but occasionally as / I/. Despite\nthis maintenance of a three-vowel system in their internal L 2\nrepresentations, sequential learners attain the same recog nition\nrate of Spanish lexical items ( Figure 7). These learners appear\nto consider / I/ an “allophone” of /e/ in Spanish, and store\nboth phones as possible realizations for words containing\nphonemic |e|. We discuss the implications of these predictions\nbelow.\n4Welch’st -test, two-sided, t = 30. 5903, df = 69. 32, p < 2.2e−16 (smallest ﬂoating\npoint number representable in R).\n5 Per input F1 value, relative frequency of response for each vowel was summed\nper learner type (sequential vs. interactive); Pearson’s chi-sq uared (response ×\ntype) was signiﬁcant (N1 = N2 = 50, df = 2, χ 2 = 7.06, Bonferroni-corrected\np = 0.00047).Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 August 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 1000\nvan Leussen and Escudero Modeling second-language perception and recognition\nFIGURE 7 | Lexical recognition rates over time for Dutch L1 (left ) and Spanish L2 (right) training.

We provide\na computational, network-like model of L2 perception and\nlexicalization. The revised L2LP retains (psycho) linguist ic\nconcepts on representations and evaluation of input data, but\nremoves a number of assumptions from theoretical phonology\nabout the way units on these levels of representation are\nconnected. Discarding these assumptions has increased the\nexplanatory power of the model, suggesting that a strictly\nsymbolic view of the phonetics-phonology interface is not\nconsistent with what we know about L2 learning. Another nove l\naspect was that we trained our simulated learners on data take n\ndirectly from vowel production studies, rather than artiﬁci al\ndistributions.\nOur ﬁrst aim was to explore the viability of a meaning-\ndriven learning paradigm, in which learners have access to the\nintended meanings but not to the phonological speciﬁcations o f\nthe L2 input. Simulated learners showed progress toward native -\nlike perception and recognition of front vowels, progressively\nadapting to the L2 in a way similar to real-life L2 learners\n(\nEscudero and Boersma, 2002 ). This mirrors the results of\nan earlier modeling study ( Boersma and Escudero, 2008 ) but\nobviates the assumption that overt phonological structure is\npresent in the learning input.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 August 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 1000\nvan Leussen and Escudero Modeling second-language perception and recognition\nSecondly, the revised model allows us to diﬀerentiate\nbetween a sequential and an interactive perspective on phoneti c\n(pre-lexical) perception and lexical recognition. While both\nversions of the model gravitate toward correct recognition\nof the L2, they make diﬀerent predictions on the phonetic\nrepresentations ultimately employed by learners. Speciﬁcall y,\nsequential learners are predicted to retain an L1 phonetic\ncategory for certain “boundary” stimuli whereas interacti ve\nlearners ultimately fully adapt their vowel system to the L2.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that adult L2 learners only ver y\nrarely reach native-like ability, which at ﬁrst glance seem s more\nin line with the results of our sequential learners (but see\nBongaerts, 1999 ). However, experimental evidence is needed in\norder to untangle the inﬂuence of L1 on the perception of L2\nlearners. Previous research (e.g., Escudero and Boersma, 2002;\nMayr and Escudero, 2010; Escudero et al., 2012 ) have studied\nL2 categorization behavior by activating listeners’ L2 language\nmode (Grosjean, 2000). We conjecture that categorical perception\neﬀects (discrimination peaks) in the region of the old L1 phonet ic\ncategories (e.g., the subsumed Dutch / I/) when perceiving the\nL2 may provide clues for the accuracy of either the sequential\nor the interactive model. These eﬀects may be measured with\ndiscrimination and identiﬁcation experiments, presenting t he\nrelevant tokens to advanced Dutch learners of Spanish in thei r\nSpanish language mode6. Experiments can include more sensitive\nmeasures such as reaction times or event-related potentials to\nexamine whether retaining the extra L1 vowel category negat ively\naﬀects L2 perception. Indeed, previous studies have shown that\n6A reviewer suggested the possibility that either strategy occur s in real-life L2\nlearners, and is perhaps a locus of individual diﬀerences in L2 acqu isition. The\npotential co-existence of the two types of grammars in the same liste ner or\ndiﬀerences across listeners can also be explored with the proposed experi ments.\nthe availability of extra phonetic categories aﬀects native a nd\nnon-native vowel perception ( Benders et al., 2012; Elvin et al.,\n2014). Our results thus oﬀer testable hypotheses that may in\nturn contribute to the general debate of sequential vs. inte ractive\nlanguage processing ( Norris et al., 2000; McClelland et al., 2006 ).\nWe conclude that L2LP oﬀers a workable and fruitful model\nof the processes underlying acquisition of non-native sound\nsystems. Compared to alternative models of L2 acquisition, t he\nsimulation paradigm illustrated in this study allows L2LP to m ake\nvery speciﬁc predictions on how L1 experience and L2 input\nshape the outcome of learning. These numerical predictions\ncan be compared to empirical ﬁndings and in turn inform\nnew hypotheses. Future work is to investigate whether L2LP’s\nsuccess extends beyond the SUBSET scenario described above—\nfor instance, the reverse scenario (which would be an instanc e of\nthe L2LP NEW scenario) of going from a two-way to a three-way\ncontrast, and would therefore require the creation of a new L 2\ncategory rather than the discontinued use of an old L1 categor y.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Jaydene Elvin and Daniel Williams for\ncomments on this paper.
