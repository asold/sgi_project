  "abstract": "In this paper, the wave digital filter (WDF) theory is applied for development of the wave digital models of ideal and real transformers which can be used for modeling of more complex structures. The transformers wave digital networks are described and developed here based on scattering variables and two-port and three-port networks of parallel and series adaptors. WDF-based model of a real transformer includes parasitic resistors and inductors, which are usual in low-frequency transformer equivalent circuit.",
