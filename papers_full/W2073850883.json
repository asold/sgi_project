    "abstract": "The math teaching has generally issues about paying attention and trusting ownself for learners. To solve such a critical problem, information technology, which are used in educational technologies tool, Geogebra, is used. In this study, teaching parabola sections with Geogebra and its effect on attitude and success of twelfth grade students are analyzed. All students were separated into two homogeneous groups and both of them were trained. After the course they were examined and the results were evaluated. The collected data shows that visuality and dynamic of geometric shapes provide easier and interesting learning for both teachers and students. © 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",
