INTRODUCTION\nElectric power distribution transformers are signiﬁcant ele-\nments of power systems, and their operation plays an impor-\ntant role in the reliability and resilience of the system. Hence,\nestimating the stress caused by their operating conditions is\nimportant for mitigating their loss of life and the probability\nof failure.\nLife of the power transformers mainly depends on the life\nof their cellulose paper insulation which deteriorates with\nthermal stress, moisture, and oxygen. Oxygen and moisture\ncan be managed to remain minimal; however, temperature is\nnot as manageable [1]. The life of the transformer is governed\nby its thermal behavior [2]. Because the temperature in a\ntransformer is distributed non-linearly, the insulation exposed\nto the hottest spot temperature experiences the fastest degra-\ndation and would be the most likely to fail [3]. Hence, using\nthe hottest spot temperature in thermal models provides the\nbest estimation for transformer life.\nA. MOTIVATION\nThermal stress is one of the main reasons for transformers’\nloss of life and failure [4]. The temperature of transformer\nwindings and insulation systems, oil for example, is a major\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Arpan Kumar Pradhan.\nfactor effecting transformer loading capability [5]. Quantify-\ning transformers’ loss of life and probability of failure as a\nfunction of loading may be then used for grid planning and\noperation studies.\nFor planning purposes, the calculation burden may not be\nas important, but for operational applications, it is important\nto reduce the calculation burden as much as possible due to\nthe limited time for assessing the situation and making an\nappropriate decision.\nFor both planning and operational purposes, transformer\nthermal stress assessment may be utilized in solving an opti-\nmization problem. There are simple and effective algorithms\nfor solving large scale linear optimization problems using a\nlow-cost processor. However, if the formulation is non-linear,\nﬁnding an optimal solution may become a challenging and\ncomputationally expensive task. Providing a linear formu-\nlation for transformer loss of life and probability of failure\nenables the solution of planning and operational optimization\nproblems using standard approaches and processors.\nB. PRIOR RESEARCH\nQuantifying the loss of life and the probability of failure for\ntransformers has been a subject of extensive research. In one\nof the ﬁrst publications in this area, historical failure data\nwere used to calculate the probability distribution function\nVOLUME 10, 2022 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Because sufﬁcient failure data\nfor a transformer may not be available and the lifetime of\nthe transformer is relatively long, studies have attempted to\nprovide a more accurate estimation of the parameters of the\ndistribution functions [7], [8].\nSeveral distribution functions have been studied for the\npurpose of transformer life evaluation. Some have used nor-\nmal and log-normal distributions [7], [9], while another used\nPerk’s hazard function [10]. Yet another paper used gen-\neralized exponential distribution [11]. Weibull distribution\nhas been discussed extensively for this purpose [7], [9],\n[12]–[16]. All distributions used in these methods are highly\nnonlinear. Arrhenius model is used for life assessment of\nvarious power system components such as transformers [17],\nsurge arresters [18], [19], electrical insulating materials [20],\nand cables [21].\nTemperature related chemical changes in the electrical\ninsulation were discussed in [22] for the ﬁrst time. The\nlife of an insulator can be impacted by the surrounding\ninsulation medium as well [23]. The surrounding medium\nfor the oil-ﬁlled transformers is oil and thermal stress\nmay cause chemical reactions that lead to release of sev-\neral gases in the transformer oil [24]. These gases can be\nanalyzed by chromatography and used to detect thermal\nstress [25]. Various ratio-based methods are introduced in\nseveral standards including IEEE C57.104-2008 [26], IEC\n60599 [27], and ASTM D3612-90 [28] as well as graphical\nmethods [29], [30]. In addition to the conventional methods,\nthere have been recent efforts for dissolved gas analysis as\ndescribed in [31] and [32].\nC. CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER\nWe adopted the formulation of the Arrhenius model for life\nassessment with a Weibull distribution. The linear form of\nthis model was analytically obtained using Taylor series; the\nproposed linear form is used for life evaluation in a Monte\nCarlo simulation of 250,000 cases with different loading sce-\nnarios. We show that the proposed formulation has acceptable\nperformance compared to the original nonlinear form.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nThe formula for calculating the hottest spot temperature\nof the transformers is explained in Section II. In Section III,\nthe Arrhenius model is discussed. Linearization of the loss\nof life and probability of failure equations are described in\nSections IV and V , respectively. The validation and con-\nclusions are outlined in Sections VI and VII, respectively,\nfollowed by references.\nII. HOTTEST SPOT TEMPERATURE\nThe hottest spot temperature is the main factor in assess-\ning the loss of life and the probability of failure of a\ntransformer. The deterioration of transformer insulation is\na function of time and temperature [5], [33]. There are\nseveral IEEE standards for calculating the hottest spot tem-\nperature [34]. The hottest spot temperature, θH , consists of\nthree parts: the ambient temperature ( θa) in Kelvin, the top\noil temperature rise over ambient temperature ( 1θTO), and\nthe conductor temperature rise over the top oil temperature\n(1θW ). It is calculated as follows :\nθH =θa +1θTO +1θW . (1)\nTop oil temperature rise over ambient temperature can be\ncalculated using (2):\n1θTO =1θTO,rated ·\n[x ·R +1\nR +1\n]n\n, (2)\nwhere 1θTO,rated is the transformer’s top oil temperature rise\nover the ambient temperature under nominal loading, x is\nthe ratio of the apparent loading of the transformer to its\nnameplate rating, R is the ratio of loss at rated load to no load\nloss, and n is the exponential power of loss versus the top oil\ntemperature rise. We rewrite (2) as\n1θTO =1θTO,rated ·[αx +β]n , (3)\nwhere\nα = R\nR +1, (4)\nβ = 1\nR +1. (5)\nThe conductor temperature rise over top oil temperature\ncan be calculated using (6):\n1θW =1θW ,rated ·x2m, (6)\nwhere 1θW ,rated is the conductor temperature rise over the\ntop oil temperature at the rated load, and m is the exponential\npower of the winding loss versus winding gradient.\nThe equations introduced so far are used for steady-state\ncalculations. To calculate the transient temperature, the tran-\nsient values of the top oil temperature rise over the ambi-\nent temperature and the conductor temperature rise over the\ntop oil temperature can be calculated using (7) and (8),\nrespectively:\n1θTO =(1θTO,ult −1θTO,ini)\n(\n1−e\n−t\nτO\n)\n+1θTO,ini, (7)\n1θW =(1θW ,ult −1θW ,ini)\n(\n1−e\n−t\nτW\n)\n+1θW ,ini, (8)\nwhere ini and ult refer to the steady-state values at the\nbeginning and end of each time step, respectively. Terms τW\nand τTO are the conductor and oil thermal time constants,\nrespectively, and t is the time passed from the beginning of\nthe time step. In our study, it is assumed that the time steps are\nlong enough for the temperatures to reach steady state values\nat the end of each time step. Thus, the initial values of each\ntime step are the ultimate values of the previous time step.\nA unit of time can be deﬁned for the time interval of each\ntemperature evaluation, based on the loading of the trans-\nformer. Whatever interval is assumed as the unit of time, the\noil and conductor thermal time constants should be adjusted\naccordingly. To simplify the problem and to avoid time as\n19014 VOLUME 10, 2022\nM.

Solving the\nintegrals in (9) and (10), the temperature rises can be obtained\nusing (11) and (12):\n1θTO (T ,x1,x2)\n=\n(\n1θTO,ult −1θTO,ini\n)(\n1 +τOe\n−1\nτO −τO\n)\n+1θTO,ini,\n(11)\n1θW (T ,x1,x2)\n=\n(\n1θW ,ult −1θW ,ini\n)(\n1 +τW e\n−1\nτW −τW\n)\n+1θW ,ini.\n(12)\nSubstituting the initial and ultimate temperatures using (3)\nand (6) results in what is shown in (13) and (14):\n1θTO (T ,x1,x2)\n=1θTO,rated ·\n[\nγO (αx2 +β)n +(1 −γO) (αx1 +β)n]\n,\n(13)\n1θW (T ,x1,x2)=1θW ,rated\n(\nx2m\n2 ·γW +(1 −γW )x2m\n1\n)\n,\n(14)\nwhere\nγO =1 +τOe\n−1\nτO −τO, (15)\nγW =1 +τW e\n−1\nτW −τO. (16)\nUsing (1), (13), and (14), the hottest spot temperature is\na function of the loading in the present time step and the\nprevious time step, as shown in (17).\nθH (T ,x1,x2) =θa(t) +1θTO(T ,x1,x2) +1θW (T ,x1,x2).\n(17)\nIII. ARRHENIUS MODEL\nThe Arrhenius model is a well-known life-stress model when\nthe acceleration variable is thermal. The Arrhenius reaction\nrate equation is\nR(θ) =Ce−Ea\nkBθ , (18)\nwhere R is the reaction rate; that is, the speed of reaction, C\nis a nonthermal constant, Ea is the activation energy (eV),\nkB is Boltzmann’s constant (eV/K), and θ is the absolute\ntemperature (K). Life is proportional to the inverse action\nrate; thus, λ can be deﬁned as a quantiﬁable life measure\nusing (18), as shown in (19):\nλ(θ) =Ae\nB\nθ , (19)\nwhere A and B are empirical parameters. For the electric\ntransformer age assessment, the hottest spot temperature is\nconsidered as the temperature in the Arrhenius model [34].\nThe Arrhenius equation for the transformer life-stress model\nis shown in (20):\nλ(θH (t,x‘1,x2)) =Ae\nB\nθH (t,x‘1,x2) . (20)\nIV. TRANSFORMER LOSS OF LIFE\nThe model in Equation (20) can be used along with its value\nfor normal operating conditions to determine the per-unit life\nthat the transformer loses in the time step. This is called the\naging acceleration factor ( FAA), as shown in (21):\nFAA(θH (T ,x1,x2)) = Ae\nB\nθH,ref\nAe\nB\nθH (T ,x1,x2)\n=e\nB\nθH,ref − B\nθH (T ,x1,x2) , (21)\nwhere θH,ref is the reference temperature at which the trans-\nformer is supposed to operate normally. To simplify (21), the\nnormal aging part is replaced with a constant D in (22):\nFAA(θH (T ,x1,x2)) =D ·e− B\nθH (T ,x1,x2) . (22)\nNow, we attempt to ﬁnd a linear approximation for the\nacceleration factor. The chain rule in Leibniz’s notation is\ngiven in (23):\ndf (g(x))\ndx =df (g)\ndg ·dg(x)\ndx . (23)\nThe two-variable Taylor series expansion for f (x1,x2)\naround the point ( x∗\n1 ,x∗\n2 ) is shown in (24):\nf (x1,x2) =f (x∗\n1 ,x∗\n2 ) +(x1 −x∗\n1 )∂f (x∗\n1 ,x∗\n2 )\n∂x1\n+(x2 −x∗\n2 )∂f (x∗\n1 ,x∗\n2 )\n∂x2\n+h.o.t. (24)\nBy removing the higher-order terms ( h.o.t.) in\nequation (24), the function can be estimated as shown in (25):\nf (x1,x2) =f (x∗\n1 ,x∗\n2 ) +(x1 −x∗\n1 )∂f (x∗\n1 ,x∗\n2 )\n∂x1\n+(x2 −x∗\n2 )∂f (x∗\n1 ,x∗\n2 )\n∂x2\n, (25)\nwhere x∗\n1 and x∗\n2 are the initial and ultimate loading con-\nditions for the transformer, respectively. Using (22), the\nderivative of the acceleration factor with respect to x1\nVOLUME 10, 2022 19015\nM.

(27)\nUsing (22), the derivative of the acceleration factor with\nrespect to the hottest spot temperature can be calculated as\nshown in (28):\n∂FAA(θH )\n∂θH\n=D · B\nθ2\nH\n·e−B\nθH . (28)\nUsing (13), the derivatives of the top oil temperature rise\nover the ambient temperature with respect to x1 and x2 can be\ncalculated as shown in (29) and (30):\n∂θTO\n∂x1\n=1θTO,rated ·(1 −γO) ·α·n ·(αx1 +β)n−1,\n(29)\n∂θTO\n∂x2\n=1θTO,rated ·γO ·α·n ·(αx2 +β)n−1. (30)\nUsing (14), the derivatives of the conductor temperature\nrise over the top oil temperature with respect to x1 and x2 can\nbe calculated as shown in (31) and (32):\n∂θW\n∂x1\n=1θW ,rated ·(1 −γW ) ·2m ·x2m−1\n1 , (31)\n∂θW\n∂x2\n=1θW ,rated ·γW ·2m ·x2m−1\n2 . (32)\nUsing (17), (29), and (31), the derivative of the hottest\nspot temperature with respect to x1 is calculated as shown\nin (33):\n∂θH\n∂x1\n=1θTO,rated ·(1 −γO) ·α·n ·(αx1 +β)n−1\n+1θW ,rated ·(1 −γW ) ·2m ·x2m−1\n1 . (33)\nSimilarly, using (17), (30), and (32), the derivative of the\nhottest spot temperature with respect to x2 is calculated as\nshown in (34):\n∂θH\n∂x2\n=1θTO,rated ·γO ·α·n ·(αx2 +β)n−1\n+1θW ,rated ·γW ·2m ·x2m−1\n2 . (34)\nUsing (26), (28), and (33), the derivative of the acceleration\nfactor with respect to x1 is calculated as shown in (35):\n∂FAA\n∂x1\n=\n(\n1θTO,rated ·(1−γO) ·α·n ·(αx1 +β)n−1\n+1θW ,rated ·(1−γW) ·2m ·x2m−1\n1\n)\n·D · B\nθ2\nH\n·e−B\nθH .\n(35)\nSimilarly, using (27), (28), and (33), the derivative of the\nacceleration factor with respect to x2 is calculated as\nshown in (36):\n∂FAA\n∂x2\n=\n(\n1θTO,rated ·γO ·α·n ·(αx2 +β)n−1\n+1θW ,rated ·γW ·2m ·x2m−1\n2\n)\n·D · B\nθ2\nH\n·e−B\nθH .\n(36)\nUsing (25), (35), and (36), and simplifying the notation\nθH (x∗\n1 ,x∗\n2 ) to θH , the acceleration factor can be estimated in\nlinear form for x1 and x2 as shown in (37):\nFAA(T ,x1,x2)\n=D ·e−B\nθH\n+(x1 −x∗\n1 )\n(\n1θTO,rated ·(1−γO)·α·n·(αx∗\n1 +β)n−1\n+1θW ,rated ·(1−γW )·2m·(x∗\n1 )2m−1\n)\n·D·B\nθ2\nH\n·e−B\nθH\n+(x2 −x∗\n2 )\n(\n1θTO,rated ·γO ·α·n ·(αx∗\n2 +β)n−1\n+1θW ,rated ·γW ·2m ·(x∗\n2 )2m−1\n)\n·D · B\nθ2\nH\n·e−B\nθH .\n(37)\nThe remaining question to be addressed is the values of\nx∗\n1 and x∗\n2 . Equation (37) is a general equation and based\non the study and different operating conditions, it may be\nmore effective to use the predicted loading values for x∗\n1\nand x∗\n2 . In addition, for situations in which the loading may\nvary signiﬁcantly, several values of x∗\n1 and x∗\n2 can be used in\norder to construct a linear approximation. Hence, simulations\ndescribed in Section IV explore multiple choices of values of\nx∗\n1 and x∗\n2 in (37).\nV. TRANSFORMER PROBABILITY OF FAILURE\nIt is suggested in [5] that the Weibull distribution is suitable\nfor use in the transformer’s probability of failure in its life\nspan. In addition, as discussed in Section III, the Arrhenius\nmodel is used to model the thermal degradation of the trans-\nformer’s insulation. Thus, the probability of a thermal-related\nfailure for a transformer can be quantiﬁed using Arrhenius-\nWeibull model. The probability density function (PDF) for\ntwo-parameter Weibull distribution is given by (38):\nf (t,x1,x2) = δ\nλ(x1,x2) ·\n( t\nλ(x1,x2)\n)δ−1\ne\n−\n(\nt\nλ(x1,x2)\n)δ\n,\n(38)\nwhere δand λare the shape and characteristic life parameters,\nrespectively. As explained in [5], [14], and [16], the character-\nistic life parameter is the same as the Arrhenius relationship\ngiven by (20). The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of\na continuous random variable X can be calculated from its\nPDF fX (t) as shown in (39):\nFX (x) =\n∫ x\n−∞\nfX (t)dt. (39)\n19016 VOLUME 10, 2022\nM. Soleimaniet al.: Linear Arrhenius-Weibull Model for Power Transformer Thermal Stress Assessment\nUsing (38) and (39), the CDF of the Arrhenius-Weibull\nmodel is as shown in (40):\nF(t,x1,x2) =1 −e\n−\n(\nt\nλ(x1,x2)\n)δ\n. (40)\nBy substituting λfrom (20) in (40), the CDF can be written\nin the form shown in (41):\nF(t,x1,x2) =1 −e\n−\n(\nt\nAe\nB\nθH (t,x1,x2)\n)δ\n. (41)\nReference [35] proposes a formulation for the probability\nof failure, as shown in (42):\nPf (T ,x1,x2) =\n∫T +1t\nT f (t,x1,x2)dt∫∞\nT f (t,x1,x2)dt , (42)\nwhere 1t is the length of the time interval, and f (t,x1,x2) is\nthe failure probability density function. Using (42), the failure\nprobability can be written as shown in (43).\nPf (T ,x1,x2) = f (T ,x1,x2)\n1 −F(T ,x1,x2). (43)\nUsing (38) and (40), equation (43) can be written as shown\nin (44):\nPf (T ,x1,x2) = δ\nλ(x1,x2) ·\n( T\nλ(x1,x2)\n)δ−1\n. (44)\nTo linearize (44), the method explained in Section IV is\ndeployed.

(51)\nThe values of x∗\n1 and x∗\n2 can be assigned similar to the\nexplanation in this regard in the last paragraph of Section IV.\nConsidering that failure occurs only once, the probability\nof failure is conditional on the fact that the transformer has\nsurvived until the time of analysis [16]. This type of proba-\nbility depends on the behavior of the equipment in the past;\ntherefore, the Markov model is inapplicable. This formulation\nis based on a ﬁxed operating temperature. Hence, to deploy\nit to evaluate the probability of failure for each moment,\nit should be calculated for similar aging conditions, that is, the\nequivalent operating time if the transformer had operated in\nthe current operating condition from the beginning. For exam-\nple, if the operating condition is normal, the transformer’s\neffective aging in one year is equal to one year. However,\nif the transformer operates under the overloading condition,\nVOLUME 10, 2022 19017\nM.

Hence, this\nformulation should use the operating time for the operating\ncondition that leads to the same aging condition that the\ntransformer is in rather than the real operating time. The\neffective age of the transformer can be calculated using (20),\nas shown in (52):\nTAge ·Ae\nB\nθH,ref =T ·Ae\nB\nθH (x1,x2) .

VALIDATION\nIn this section, we describe a Monte Carlo simulation to\nevaluate the precision of the developed linear equations in\ncomparison to the non-linear equations for transformer loss\nof life and probability of failure. For this purpose, ﬁve levels\nof loading for the transformer as shown in Table 1 were\nconsidered.\nThe values x∗shown in Table 1 are the linearization points\nthat will be used in (42) and (56) as x∗\n1 and x∗\n2 , which can\nbe employed to obtain a linear approximation. Because ﬁve\nlevels of loading are considered, based on the initial and\nultimate loads, there are 25 linear pieces. Although in this\n19018 VOLUME 10, 2022\nM.

The level sets of linear approximation based on (x∗\n1 , x∗\n2 ) point\nrepresenting the corresponding intervals from Table 1 are shown in blue.\npaper all scenarios are considered, in the real world, it is not\nlikely that the loading of a transformer jumps from ‘‘Low’’\nto ‘‘Extreme’’, for example, so many of the 25 deﬁned linear\napproximations may not be used. However, they are consid-\nered for the purpose of generality. The characteristics of the\ntransformer used in this case study are adopted from [14] and\nare shown in Table 2.\nIn the Monte Carlo simulation, 10,000 scenarios of loading\nare generated for each of the 25 linear pieces. The sample\nFIGURE 2. An illustration of the linear approximation for the\ntransformer’s probability of failure for fixed (a) Pf=3e-7, (b) Pf=5e-7, and\n(c) Pf=7e-7.

(60)\nTo visualize the accuracy of the proposed formulations\nfor transformer loss of life and probability of failure, a new\nsimulation is performed and x2 is drawn with respect to x1\nfor ﬁxed values of FAA and Pf . The results are shown in\nFigures 1 and 2. In these ﬁgures, the red lines represent the\noriginal non-linear models. To draw the red lines, the values\nof FAA and Pf are assumed to be ﬁxed and 160 uniformly\ndistributed points from 0.01 to 1.6 are assigned to x1. For each\nsample points of x1 and ﬁxed value of FAA or Pf , the value\nof x2 is calculated using the non-linear Arrhenius-Weibull\nmodel. The 32 blue points in each ﬁgure are uniformly dis-\ntributed for x1 ∈[0.05,1.6]. Similar to the red line, for each\nsample point of x1 and ﬁxed value of FAA or Pf , the value of\nx2 is calculated using the corresponding linear approximation\nproposed in this paper. The linear formulation is calculated\nbased on ( x∗\n1 ,x∗\n2 ) point representing the interval containing\nthe corresponding red point, as shown in Table 1. As seen in\nthe ﬁgures, the proposed linear model is close to the original\nnonlinear model.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThis paper proposes a linear form of the Arrhenius-Weibull\nmodel for transformer loss of life and the probability of\nfailure. Linearization was performed using a Taylor series\nunder different loading conditions. The proposed formulation\nis used in a case study that uses a Monte Carlo simulation\nof 250,000 cases. The average errors of the linear models\ncompared to the non-linear model are calculated, and it is\nobserved that the error is acceptable, which makes the pro-\nposed formulation accurate enough to be deployed.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe views and opinions of authors expressed herein do not\nnecessarily state or reﬂect those of the U.S. Government or\nany agency thereof.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.-J.
