    "abstract": "Accurate traffic prediction is vital for traffic management, control, and urbanization construction. Extensive research efforts have diligently focused on capturing the intricate spatio-temporal relationships that are inherent in traffic data. However, a limited number of studies have fully exploited the potential of periodicity, a distinctive and valuable characteristic of transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel GRU- and Transformer-Based Periodicity Fusion Network (GTPFN) to distinguish the effects of different types of periodic data and integrate them seamlessly and effectively. Initially, the proposed model captures dynamic spatio-temporal correlations and obtains the candidate prediction result by employing a GRU encoder–decoder with spatial attention, focusing on the hourly data. Subsequently, we design the Pattern Induction Block based on GRU layers to extract regular traffic patterns from daily and weekly data. Finally, the Pattern Fusion Transformer integrates these patterns, followed by a Feedforward layer, to yield the final prediction output. Experiments on the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PEMS) datasets illustrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-art baseline models on most predicted horizons.",
