Modern physics is a branch of physics that \ndeals with physical phenomena from a modern point of \nview to explain physical phenomena that cannot be \nexplained classically. Modern physics is one of the \ncompulsory courses that students of the physics \neducation study program at the University of Mataram \nmust take. Modern physics learning outcomes are still \nrelatively low. This can be seen in the many students \nwho have to repeat modern physics courses in other \nsemesters. Difficulty in studying modern physics is \ninfluenced by its abstract material, making it difficult \nfor students to understand. \nModern physics learning will run smoothly if \ngood planning is carried out following the nature of \nphysics learning which  emphasizes science process \nskills and scientific creativity (Fatwa, et al., 2018 ), \nMunthe and Bermawi,  2009). Good quality learning \nwill be achieved if good learning tools are available. \nImproving the quality of learning for a lecturer is very \nJurnal Penelitian Pendidikan IPA (JPPIPA) January 2022, Volume 8, Issue 1, 291-295 \n \n292 \nstrategic because the lecturer functions as the \nspearhead of the change from not being able to become \ncapable, from not being able to master to mastering, \nand from not understanding to understanding  \n(Khasanah, et al., 2019) . Besides, student factors, \navailable facilities, tools, and media, as well as \nenvironmental factors can also affect the learning \nprocess (Kartini, et al., 2019) . One of the factors that \naffect the quality of learning is the use of appropriate \nlearning models. The choice of learning model must be \nfollowing the material being taught (Wahyudi, et al ., \n2019). \nOne of the learning models that can provide \nopportunities for students to understand the concepts \nof modern physics is the guided inquiry learning model \n(Susilawani, et al., 2019). Inquiry learning is designed to \ninvite students directly into the scientific process in a \nrelatively short time. Implementation of the guided \ninquiry learning model emphasizes the activities of \nstudents maximally to train critical thinking skills to \nimprove student learning outcomes (Susilawati, et al., \n2019). \nIn addition to the application of appropriate \nlearning models, another factor that affects the learning \nprocess is the use of appropriate learning media. Even \nmore so for modern abstract physics ma terial. The \nmedia used can be real media and virtual media \n(Sugiono, 2014) . For modern physics learning, virtual \nmedia is needed because the material is focused on \nphysical phenomena that cannot be observed directly. \nOne of the virtual media that is curren tly available and \ncan be used as a media for learning media for virtual \nlaboratory production from PhET Colorado. PhET has \ntheoretical and experimental simulations that actively \ninvolve the user. PhET simulation can display a physics \nanimation that is abst ract or cannot be seen by the \nnaked eye such as atoms, electrons, photons, and \nmagnetic fields. Besides being able to build concepts, \nPhET can also be used to b ring up science process \nskills. \n \n \nMethod  \n \nModern physics learning tools use an inquiry \nmodel with the help of virtual media. PhET is \ndeveloped using a 4 D model design (define, design, \ndevelop and disseminate)  (Fraenkel, et al., 2012) . The \nresearch design used in this study was a one -group \npretest-posttest design  to obtain data on the \neffectiveness of learning devices (Doyan, et al., 2020). \nThe sample used in this study were all prospective \nteacher undergraduate students in one class who took \nmodern physics courses with a total of 20 people. \nBefore the modern physics learning device was given, \nall students were given a preliminary test that aims to \nfind out the initial knowledge possessed by students \nwho take modern physics courses. Furthermore, the \nfinal test is given to determine the increase in c ognitive \nlearning outcomes, science process skills, and scientific \ncreativity. The tests given are in the form of cognitive \ntests, science processing skills tests, and creativity tests. \nQuantitative data analysis was used to determine \ncognitive learning ou tcomes, science process skills, and \ncreativity of prospective teacher students . The increase \nin learning outcomes is measured by the N -gain test  \n(Doyan, et al., 2020) . The results of the N -gain \ncalculation obtained are matched with the N -Gain. The \nN-Gain value consists of high (N -gain> 0.7), medium \n(0.70> N-gain ≥ 0.30), and low (N -gain <0.3) categories  \n(Susilawati, 2019). \n \nResult and Discussion \n \nAnalysis of research data in the cognitive domain \nconsisted of the pre -test, post -test, and N -gain scores. \nThe mean score for the pre -test was 44.30, while the \naverage score for the post -test was 81.05. Based on the \npre-test and post -test data, it can be determined the \nvalue of the increase in learning outcomes by \ncalculating the N-gain value. The resu lts of the analysis \nof the N -gain value obtained for each student are \nshown in Figure 1. \n \n \nFigure 1. Graph of the N-Gain score of each student of prospective teacher\nJurnal Penelitian Pendidikan IPA (JPPIPA) January 2022, Volume 8, Issue 1, 291-295 \n \n293 \nBased on Fig ure 1. it is clear that the N -gain value \nfor each student ranges from 0.5 to 0.8. This means that \nthe value of improvin g student learning outcomes by \nusing modern physics learning tools using the inquiry \nmodel with the help of virtual media PhET is in the \nmedium to high category. This shows that the use of \nthe inquiry model with virtual media PhET greatly \naffects the cogni tive learning outcomes of prospective \nteacher students (Nurmayani, et al., 2018; Susilawati, et \nal., 2019). \nAnalysis of the next research data is on the aspects \nof science process skills. Indicators for aspects of \nscience process skills include the abili ty to observe, \npropose hypotheses, predict, design experiments to \ninterpret data, communicate, and apply concepts. \nDescriptive analysis for each aspect is given in the form \nof the average mastery of each aspect. After that, the \naverage of each aspect maste ry is described in the \ncategory of the level of mastery of aspects of science \nprocess skills. The average percentage of mastery of \neach component of the science process skills obtained is \nshown in Figure 2. \n \n \nFigure 2. Average mastery of science process skills aspects \n \nBased on Figure 2. it is clear that the  pre-test has \nan average of less than 50 so that it is in the category of \n\"very poor\". It is different from the average in the post -\ntest, where the data is categorized as \"good\" for \nindicators of observing and predicting, while the \"very \ngood\" category is for indicators of proposing \nhypotheses, designing experiments, interpreting data, \nand applying concepts. \nThe scores for the pre -test and post -test of science \nprocess skills as a whole were 41.35 and 73.50. The \nresults of the N -gain value analysis were 0.7 7 with the \nhigh category. The high value of improvement shows \nthat there is an effect of using modern physics learning \ntools using the inquiry model with the help of PhET \nvirtual media on the science skills of prospective \nteacher students  (Asy’ari, et al.,  2019; Astutik, et al., \n2018). This is because the use of the inquiry model with \nthe help of virtual media PhET helps students practice \nscience process skills such as observing, proposing \nhypotheses, predicting, designing experiments, \ninterpreting data, an d applying concepts. PhET \nprovides experience in conducting abstract experiments \nwith all kinds of possibilities (Doyan, et al., 2014). \nAnalysis of the next research da ta is on the aspects \nof students' scientific creativity. Indicators for the \naspect of creativity include fluency, flexibility, and \noriginality. Descriptive analysis for each aspect is given \nin the form of an average for each aspect. The average \nfor each aspect of students 'scientific creativity obtained \nis shown in Fig. 3. Based on Fig. 3, it is clear that the \naverage difference between the pre -test and post -test \nresults of the mastery of students' scientific creativity \naspects is evident. Fig. 3 shows that  the post-test score \nis higher than the pre-test. \nThe scores for the pre -test and post -test of student \nscientific creativity as a whole were 33.31 and 72.41. \nThe results of the analysis of the N-gain value were 0.76 \nin the high category. The high value of  increase shows \nthat there is an effect of using modern physics learning \ntools using the inquiry model with the help of PhET \nvirtual media on student scientific creativity  (Palupi, et \nal., 2020) . This is because the inquiry model provides \nopportunities for  students to solve problems critically, \nanalytically, and scientifically by using certain steps \ntowards convincing conclusions because it is supported \nby data or reality so that it can increase students' \nscientific creativity (Ramlee, et al., 2019; Verawati, et al., \n2020) \n \nJurnal Penelitian Pendidikan IPA (JPPIPA) January 2022, Volume 8, Issue 1, 291-295 \n \n294 \n \nFigure 3. Average mastery in the aspect of scientific creativity \n \nBased on the results of the above research  (Figure \n3), it can be seen that the use  of the inquiry model with \nthe help of PhET virtual media helps improve students' \nthinking skills. Increased thinking skills of students will \nhave a positive effect on learning outcomes, especially \nfor abstract modern physics material. By using PhET \nmedia, students are helped in the problem -solving \nprocess. For example, in the photoelectric effect \nmaterial. By using PhET, students can observe the effect \nof electric photos directly and try t o do experiments to \nfind out the quantities that affect and the relationship of \neach quantity. This of course will greatly help students \nto better understand the material. \n \nConclusion  \n \nBased on the results of the analysis, it can be \nconcluded that modern physics learning tools using the \nPhET virtual media assisted inquiry model can affect \nthe learning outcomes of prospective teacher students. \nThe use of these tools can improve cognitive learning \noutcomes, science process skills and scientific creativity \nof prospective teacher students. These results indicate \nthat the use of modern physics learning tools using an \ninquiry model with the help of PhET virtual media is \neffective for cognitive learning outcomes, science \nprocess skills and scientific creativity o f prospective \nteacher students. \n \nAcknowledgments  \n \nThe writer thanks to the physics education study \nprogram, FKIP, Mataram University has facilitated this \nresearch.
