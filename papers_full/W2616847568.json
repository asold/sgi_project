  "abstract": "Transformers have an insulation system based on dielectric oil and paper. Several factors as shortcircuits, high load, or overheating influence the aging of the insulating system. Thus, these materials are decomposed during transformer operation, and its state determines the status of the transformer. The degree of polymerization of dielectric paper is an indicator of its real condition. The concentration of furanic compounds in oil offer an estimation of paper degradation. Moreover, these compounds are easy to measure from oil samples. This paper review equations which relate one or more properties of the insulating system with the life expectancy of the transformer. These equations were used in a fleet of transformers in order to estimate the accuracy of these mathematical models. Results show that these methods achieve the most reliable estimation when the transformers have operated less than 8 years. Nevertheless, when the transformers are older, the estimation of lifetime based on furanic compounds is quite erratic and should be improved.",
