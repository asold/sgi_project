  "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the rapidly advancing era of Artificial Intelligence&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(AI), Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a pivotal&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;force, revolutionizing the automated creation of diverse content.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;At the same time, Machine Learning (ML), particularly Deep&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Learning (DL), has achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;in optimization and inference tasks across various domains, including&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;telecommunications. However, the division of technological&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;domains poses challenges to the integration of powerful AI/ML&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;capabilities towards realizing the vision of &amp;ldquo;AI-native&amp;rdquo; networks,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;such as future 6G networks, aiming to offer ubiquitous intelligence&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;across their infrastructure and service planes, seamlessly&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;adapting and evolving to support new application classes. The&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;paper proposes a novel out-of-the-box framework, TimesLM, for&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;automated time series analytics, which is particularly useful for&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;the Edge-Cloud orchestration framework CODECO, leveraging&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the challenge&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;of developing general-purpose solutions by utilizing lightweight&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;LLMs as forecasters and optimizers. TimesLM offers zero-shot&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;and few-shot inference capabilities, enabling confident uncertainty&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;navigation for decision-making in AI-Native networks. Its architecture&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;integrates global optimization with lightweight LLMs,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;followed by input enrichment and local prompt optimization.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Evaluation results on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;improved accuracy and reduced latency, making TimesLM highly&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;competitive against SoTA approaches, while reducing operational&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;costs and carbon-footprint. A limitations analysis is also presented.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The proposed framework stands as a promising and sustainable&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;step towards realizing the envisioned capabilities of AI-Native&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;networks through LLM-powered time series analytics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",
