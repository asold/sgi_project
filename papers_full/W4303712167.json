    "abstract": "With the evolution of machine learning and deep learning, more and more researchers have utilized these methods in the field of underwater acoustic target recognition. In these studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the main components of recognition models. In recent years, a neural network model Transformer that uses a self-attention mechanism was proposed and achieved good performance in deep learning. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based underwater acoustic target recognition model STM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce Transformer into the underwater acoustic field. We compared the performance of STM with CNN, ResNet18, and other multi-class algorithm models. Experimental results illustrate that under two commonly used dataset partitioning methods, STM achieves 97.7% and 89.9% recognition accuracy, respectively, which are 13.7% and 50% higher than the CNN Model. STM also outperforms the state-of-the-art model CRNN-9 by 3.1% and ResNet18 by 1.8%.",
