    "abstract": "Solar radio observation is a method used to study the Sun. It is very important for space weather early warning and solar physics research to automatically classify solar radio spectrums in real time and judge whether there is a solar radio burst. As the number of solar radio burst spectrums is small and uneven, this paper proposes a classification method for solar radio spectrums based on the Swin transformer. First, the method transfers the parameters of the pretrained model to the Swin transformer model. Then, the hidden layer weights of the Swin transformer are frozen, and the fully connected layer of the Swin transformer is trained on the target dataset. Finally, parameter tuning is performed. The experimental results show that the method can achieve a true positive rate of 100%, which is more accurate than previous methods. Moreover, the number of our model parameters is only 20 million, which is 80% lower than that of the traditional VGG16 convolutional neural network with more than 130 million parameters.",
