    "abstract": "The construction of transformer substations in transmission lines is a systematic, technical, and complex project with the need for numerous materials and resources. Under the development of the green economy, the requirements for energy conservation and carbon reduction have improved; hence, an assessment of carbon emissions in transformer substations is urgently needed. A calculation method was proposed in the present study to analyze the carbon emissions of transformer substations with different kinds of data sources, which were collected from several practical projects in the west-to-east power transmission project. In this study, a detailed comparison and discussion regarding the differences in carbon emissions of 750 kV transformer substations caused by hydrology, geology, engineering quantity, and other factors were conducted. The mean value, standard deviation, and 90% confidence interval of carbon emissions were obtained by Monte Carlo simulation through MATLAB. Results show that the total carbon emissions of the selected 750 kV transformer substations are between [56,000, 68,000] t CO2 eq. Construction engineering accounts for more than 50% of carbon emissions, followed by installation engineering and additional services. In terms of input items, electricity distribution buildings contribute more than 39% of total carbon emissions, followed by cable/earthing systems, which account for 14% of total carbon emissions. Gas insulated switchgear (GIS) and air insulated switchgear (AIS) could adopt different types of equipment foundations, and GIS equipment foundations would generate fewer carbon emissions due to the smaller land area and input materials. This study can provide experience and reference for similar projects and further guide the substation carbon emission reduction work.",
