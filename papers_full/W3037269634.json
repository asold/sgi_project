Certain closed string excitations are localized at the\nedges of these rings. The string theory predictions for the energies of magnon excitations\nof these strings depends on the radii of the edges of the rings. In this article we construct\nthe operators dual to these closed string excitations and show how to reproduce the string\ntheory predictions for magnon energies by computing one loop anomalous dimensions.\nThese operators are linear combinations of restricted Schur polynomials. The distinction\nbetween what is the background and what is the excitation is accomplished in the choice\nof the subgroup and the representations used to construct the operator.\nKeywords: 1/N Expansion, AdS-CFT Correspondence, Gauge-gravity correspondence\nArXiv ePrint: 1601.06914\nOpen Access, c\rThe Authors.\nArticle funded by SCOAP3. doi:10.1007/JHEP03(2016)110\nJHEP03(2016)110\nContents\n1 Motivation 1\n2 Dilatation operator in the planar limit using restricted Schur polynomi-\nals 5\n3 How not to localize9\n4 Localized closed string states10\n5 LLM magnons15\n6 Another example and another method22\n7 Excitations on the inner edge of an annulus23\n8 Conclusions 24\nA Local restricted Schur polynomials26\nB Restricted character identities28\nB.1 Numerical check 30\nC Excitations with empty boxes32\nC.1 Schur polynomials with empty boxes 32\nC.2 Restricted Schur polynomials with empty boxes 33\nC.3 Action of the dilatation operator 34\nC.4 More general backgrounds 35\n1 Motivation\nThere is convincing support in favor of the duality between N= 4 super Yang-Mills theory\nand IIB strings on the asymptotically AdS 5\u0002S5 spacetimes [1{3]. The duality identi\fes\na gauge theory operator for each state in the string theory, and the dimension of this\noperator with the energy of the string theory state. By comparing operator dimensions\nand string state energies, we \fnd a wealth of non-trivial predictions that can be tested.\nSince the duality is a strong/weak coupling relation, the results of perturbative \feld theory\nand perturbative string theory are not related by the duality and checking the equality of\ndimensions and energies is in general highly nontrivial. In the case that we consider, gauge\ntheory operators belonging to the SU(2 j3) sector of the theory, this check can be carried\n{ 1 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nout in complete detail. This remarkable progress is possible by exploiting the symmetry of\nthe problem in an interesting way [ 4,5 ].\nThe gauge theory operator corresponding to a closed string state is a single trace\noperator [6] constructed using a very large number ( J \u0018O(\np\nN))) of scalar Z \felds, with\na few impurities (which may be the scalars X, Y, Xy or Yy or of one of four possible\nfermions). The symmetry which plays a central role is an SU(2 j2)2 symmetry which acts\non the impurities. When the impurities are well separated within the trace, each impurity\ntransforms as a short multiplet of a centrally extended SU(2j2)2 symmetry; the fact that the\nmultiplet is short determines its anomalous dimension [4]. The anomalous dimension of the\nsingle trace operator is then given by summing the dimensions of the impurities. The sum of\nthe new magnon central charges1 vanishes so that the closed string state is a representation\nof the original algebra. An inspired explanation for these dimensions was given in [ 7]. This\nphysically motivated description matches the string description, which was worked out\nin [ 8]. Exactly the same symmetry algebra plays a role and the central charges of the\nalgebra acquire an elegant geometrical interpretation as we now explain. In general, the\nanticommutator of two supersymmetries in 10 dimensional supergravity includes a gauge\ntransformation of the NS- B\u0016\u0017 \feld, which acts non-trivially on stretched strings. The\nparameter of the gauge transformation was computed in [ 9] in terms of the Killing spinors\nof the geometry. By inserting the explicit expression of the LLM Killing spinors [ 10] into\nthe general formula for the gauge transformation produced by the anticommutator of two\nsupercharges, one \fnds that the relevant NS gauge transformations on the LLM plane, are\nthose with a constant gauge parameter. Thus any string stretched along the LLM plane\nwill acquire a phase under these gauge transformations. These are the central charges that\nwe are after [8]. To develop the geometrical interpretation of these central charges, we need\nto develop the geometrical picture of the string worldsheet projected to the LLM plane.\nThe Zs inside the trace carry the quantum numbers of gravitons, which map to a single\npoint, orbiting in a circle of radius r= 1. The impurities inside the trace map into \\giant\nmagnons\" | straight line segments that stretch between the points on the r = 1 circle\nwhere the Zs are located [ 8]. Thus, magnons are represented by directed line segments\non the plane. Introduce a complex number k for each oriented segment, whose magnitude\nis the length of this segment and whose phase is the direction of this segment. Thanks\nto the fact that the gauge transformations giving rise to the central charges are constant,\nthe central charge of the corresponding magnon is k [8]. The projected closed string is a\npolygon on the LLM plane with a consistent assignment of orientation to each side of the\npolygon, so that the central charges of the magnons sum to zero.\nThe powerful SU(2j2)2 symmetry arguments developed above do not make use of the\nplanar approximation. It is then natural to expect that the argument continues to work\neven for operators with such a large dimension that the planar approximation is no longer\naccurate.2 A natural setting in which this expectation can be tested, is for open strings\nattached to giant gravitons. In this case, one is studying correlators of operators that have\n1I.e. the charges switched on for the representations of the magnon but not present in the original group.\n2In this case there is in general no integrability and so the constraints implied by the SU(2 j2)2 analysis\ngive results that would be di\u000ecult to obtain by any other method.\n{ 2 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\na bare dimension of order N. This has been carried out for the maximal giant in [ 11] and\nin complete generality (any number of giants and dual giants of any size) in [ 12]. These\nstudies con\frm that the SU(2j2)2 symmetry arguments continue to work. Another natural\nsituation to consider is that of closed strings (and/or giant gravitons) exploring the LLM\ngeometries. These correspond to operators with a bare dimension of order N2. In this\narticle we study this general class of problems.\nThe LLM geometries are regular 1\n2 BPS solutions of type IIB string theory that are\nasymptotically AdS5\u0002S5. They are dual to operators constructed using a single complex\n\feld Z. These geometries enjoy an R\u0002SO(4) \u0002SO(4) isometry group and have a metric\nwhich is given by ( i;j = 1;2)\nds2 = \u0000h\u00002(dt+ Vidxi)2 + h2(dy2 + dxidxi) + yeGd\n2\n3 + ye\u0000Gd~\n2\n3 ; (1.1)\nwhere\nh\u00002 = 2ycosh G; z = 1\n2 tanh G; (1.2)\ny@yVi = \u000fij@jz; y (@iVj \u0000@jVi) = \u000fij@yz: (1.3)\nThus, the metric is completely determined by the function z, which is a function of y;x1\nand x2. It is obtained by solving\n@i@iz+ y@y\n@yz\ny = 0: (1.4)\nRegularity requires that z= \u00061\n2 on the LLM (y= 0) plane. As a consequence, the complete\nset of LLM solutions can be labeled by coloring the entire LLM plane into black (where\nz= \u00001\n2 ) and white (where z= +1\n2 ) regions [10].\nEach LLM geometry corresponds to a speci\fc 1\n2 BPS operator. We will restrict our-\nselves to geometries that correspond to coloring the plane with a collection of concentric\nannuli, surrounding a central disk which may be of either color. Each such geometry corre-\nsponds to a Schur polynomial, labeled by a Young diagramB[13,14 ]. Every plane coloring\nwe consider can be translated into a Young diagram and hence into a de\fnite gauge theory\noperator. An example of the translation is shown in \fgure 4 . The AdS 5\u0002S5 geometry\ncorresponds to a black disk of radius 1. Gravitons dual to gauge theory operators built\nusing only the Z \feld would follow circular orbits at the outer edge of any black region.\nWe would also have closed string states, with worldsheet given by a polygon with every\nvertex on the outer edge of any black annulus. Each polygon edge is a magnon. Using\nthe general form of the LLM Killing spinors, it is again true that the anticommutator of\ntwo supersymmetries includes a constant gauge transformation. Consequently the central\ncharge of the magnon is still set by the corresponding line segment. The angle that the line\nsegment corresponding to a magnon subtends with respect to the origin of the LLM plane,\ndetermines the momentum of the magnon. To turn this angle into a length (and hence\nan energy) we need to know the radius of the circle(s) that the line segment's end points\nare located on. Thus, the values of the central charges as well as the dispersion relation\ndepend on the radii of the annuli in the LLM boundary condition.\n{ 3 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nFigure 1. Inward pointing corners correspond to outer radii of black regions. Each black (white)\nregion corresponds to a vertical (horizontal) line on the edge of the Young diagram. The area of each\nwhite (black) region divided by \u0019 is given by the number of columns (rows) in the corresponding\nline, divided by N. The area of the central black disk divided by \u0019 is given by N minus the total\nnumber of rows, divided by N. The total area of the black regions is \u0019.\nOur goal is to write down the operators dual to closed strings in the above LLM geome-\ntries. The \frst question we need to address is how to write down gauge theory operators\nthat are localized at the edge of an annulus in the dual gravity description. Once these\noperators are constructed, we can consider the problem of determining their anomalous\ndimensions. By computing their one loop anomalous dimensions, we can determine the\ncentral charges of the representations in which the magnons transform and compare to\nthe string theory predictions. We will \fnd complete agreement. This both gives support\nthat we have correctly constructed localized closed string states and that the SU(2 j2)2\nsymmetry analysis is still applicable in this case, as one would expect. For some of the\nclosed string operators we consider, the problem of determining the anomalous dimensions\nis an integrable problem and the results obtained in the planar limit generalize immediately\nwithout any e\u000bort.\nThis article is organized as follows: in section 2 we study the planar operator mixing\nproblem at one loop. This discussion is usually phrased in terms of single trace operators,\na language which is not useful outside of the planar limit. We translate this discussion\ninto the language of restricted Schur polynomials. It is the restricted Schur language\nthat will generalize. In section 3 we point out, using simple examples, some of the issues\nrelated to constructing operators dual to excitations localized on the LLM plane. Using\nthese insights we give our proposal for operators dual to localized closed string states in\nsection4 and we compute their anomalous dimensions in section 5 . These all correspond\nto excitations localized at the outer edge of an LLM annulus. Although our computations\nare quite technical and make heavy use of group representation theory the result is striking\nin its simplicity: the problem in the nontrivial geometry is given by simply scaling the N\ndependence in the planar result. In section 6 we consider an example that is simple enough\n{ 4 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nthat it can be treated without any use of group representation theory and we con\frm our\nresults in this simple setting. In section 7 we explain how to describe excitations localized\nat the inner edge of an LLM annulus. Finally, in section 8 we discuss our results and draw\nsome conclusions.\n2 Dilatation operator in the planar limit using restricted Schur polyno-\nmials\nTo simplify our discussion we will restrict ourselves to the su(2) sector of N = 4 super\nYang-Mills theory. Restricting to this sector does not interfere with our goal of computing\nthe central charge appearing in the SU(2 j2) symmetry algebra, but it will signi\fcantly\nsimplify our arguments. The local operators of interest to us are loops that correspond to\nclosed string states [ 6]. In the planar limit, a basis for these operators is labeled by the\nordered set of integers fnkg\nO(fnkg) = Tr(Zn1YZn2Y \u0001\u0001\u0001 ZnmY)(2.1)\nwith P\nknk = n. Not all sets correspond to distinct operators due to cyclicity of the trace.\nFor string states we would hold n+ m \u0018\np\nN and for the states we are interested in, we\ntake m\u001cn. The planar approximation is valid as long as (m+n)2\nN \u001c1. We refer to these\nas \\loop operators\" and make use of the following notation\nTr(\u001bZ\nnY\nm) = Yi1\ni\u001b(1)\n\u0001\u0001\u0001 Yim\ni\u001b(m)\nZim+1\ni\u001b(m+1)\n\u0001\u0001\u0001 Zin+m\ni\u001b(n+m)\n: (2.2)\nEach of the operators ( 2.1) corresponds to a permutation that is a single m+ n cycle\nO(fnkg) = Tr(\u001bfnkgZ\nnY\nm)(2.3)\nThe loop operators are a particularly convenient description of the planar limit. In partic-\nular, it was in terms of these variables that the link to the spin chain and the subsequent\ndiscovery of integrability was made [15,16 ]. This is a consequence of the fact that there is\na bijection between loop operators and spin chain states. In addition, these variables also\nprovide an explicit and direct link to the string worldsheet [ 17].\nIn the planar limit the loop operators are orthogonal. As we increase n+ m beyond\nO(\np\nN), the loop operators start to mix and they no longer provide a useful description [18].\nThe operators we are interested in correspond to closed string states in an LLM geome-\ntry [ 10], so that n \u0018O(N2) and m\nn \u001c1. The loop operators are useless in this limit.\nThe basis provided by the restricted Schur polynomials is far more useful: these operators\nare exactly orthogonal in the free \feld theory and their mixing at loop level is tightly\nconstrained [19,20 ].3 The de\fnition of the restricted Schur polynomial is [ 19]\n\u001fR;(r;s)\u000b\f(Z;Y ) = 1\nn!m!\nX\n\u001b2Sn+m\n\u001fR;(r;s);\u000b\f(\u001b)Yi1\ni\u001b(1)\n\u0001\u0001\u0001 Yim\ni\u001b(m)\nZim+1\ni\u001b(m+1)\n\u0001\u0001\u0001 Zin+m\ni\u001b(n+m)\n: (2.4)\n3There are a number of distinct bases that are exactly orthogonal in the free \feld limit [ 21{26].\n{ 5 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nIn this de\fnition R is a Young diagram with n+ m boxes and hence labels an irreducible\nrepresentation (irrep) of Sn+m, r is a Young diagram with n boxes and labels an irrep\nof Sn and s is a Young diagram with m boxes and labels an irrep of Sm. The group\nSn+m has an Sn \u0002Sm subgroup. Taken together r and s label an irrep of this subgroup.\nA single irrep R will in general subduce many possible representations of the subgroup.\nA particular irrep of the subgroup may be subduced more than once in which case we\nmust introduce a multiplicity label to keep track of the di\u000berent copies subduced. The\nindices \u000b and \f appearing above are these multiplicity labels. The object \u001fR;(r;s)\u000b\f(\u001b)\nis called a restricted character [ 27]. At present there are no general powerful methods to\ncompute these characters and this is one of the main obstacles that must be overcome when\nperforming explicit computations. In this section there are a number of useful identities\nthat we will prove, obtained by writing the known planar action of the dilatation operator\non loop operators, in terms of the restricted Schur polynomial operators. In the appendices\nwe will derive these results, and more general exact identities, using the representation\ntheory of the symmetric group. These identities are all we will need in this paper, so that\nwe entirely avoid the need to explicitly evaluate any restricted characters.\nThe restricted Schur polynomials provide a complete basis. As a consequence we can\nwrite the loop operators as a linear combination of restricted Schur polynomials.

We stress\nthat this is not an exact result | we have used the simpli\fcations of the planar limit to\nobtain it.\nThis rewriting of the planar dilatation operator is interesting. The above identity\nis written using Young diagrams and the language of restricted characters. However, the\nappearance of the permutations which label the loop operators keeps manifest the bijection\nto the spin chain. This is the restricted Schur polynomial way of mapping to the spin chain\ndynamics. In what follows, we will argue that the description of closed string states using\na permutation is a useful description for operators dual to closed strings probing LLM\nbackgrounds. The operators described using the permutation are certainly not single trace\noperators. Indeed, in the next section we will argue that single trace operators in the\ngauge theory are not dual to localized excitations in the dual gravity. This discussion will\nmotivate the form of the operators that are dual to closed strings in the LLM geometries.\n4The use of notation expressing the linear combination of characters as the character of a sum of the\npermutations is justi\fed by the linearity of the matrix representations of the permutations, which are used\nimplicitly when writing a restricted character:\n\u001fR;(r;s)\u00162\u00161 (\u001b1 + \u001b2) = Tr(PR!(r;s)\u00162\u00161 (\u0000R(\u001b1) + \u0000R(\u001b2))):\n{ 8 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\n3 How not to localize\nThe operators dual to the closed string states we study are composed of collections of Zs\nraised to some power, separated by Y \felds. The worldsheet geometry of these strings has\nbeen studied in [ 8]. The pieces of the worldsheet constructed by the Zs are localized on a\nparticular circle in the LLM plane, while the Y \felds correspond to worldsheet magnons\nthat stretch between these points. In this section we consider the problem of writing\noperators, composed entirely out of Zs, that are localized in the radial direction of the\nLLM plane. Using the intuition gathered from this toy problem we will construct operators\ndual to closed strings in the LLM geometries. This section is largely a review of relevant\nresults from [ 31{33]. The papers [ 34{37] include closely related ideas. These articles\nused an eigenvalue density description for the 1\n2 BPS operators in the gauge theory. The\nconstruction of localized giant graviton branes has been pursued in [38{42] using a collective\ncoordinate description.\nConsider the AdS5\u0002S5 background, which is dual to the vacuum state of N= 4 super\nYang-Mills theory. Point like gravitons, with a momentum p\u0018O(1) are dual to operators\nTr(Zp)(3.1)\nThey are localized at the radius r= 1 on the LLM plane. Thus, in this case, a single trace\noperator with O(1) \felds is dual to an object in the string theory, localized in the radial\ndirection.\nSingle trace operators do not create localized states in general [ 31]. Consider a three\nring geometry | two concentric rings with a central black disk. This corresponds to a\nSchur polynomial labeled by a Young diagram with the following shape\nR= (3.2)\nApplying Tr(Z) = \u001f (Z) to the above state, the product \u001fR(Z)\u001f (Z) is easily computed\nusing the Littlewood Richardson rule [13]. The product consists of three terms, one labeled\nby a Young diagram obtained by adding a box to row 1 of R, one labeled by a Young\ndiagram obtained by adding a box to row 7 of R and one labeled by a Young diagram\nobtained by adding a box to row 13 of R. In the dual gravity this is a superposition of\nstates. One state is the original geometry with a single graviton localized at the outer edge\nof the largest ring, one state is the original geometry with a single graviton localized at the\nouter edge of the smallest ring and the third state is the original geometry with a single\ngraviton localized at the outer edge of the central disk. Thus, the single trace state can\nnot be interpreted as an excitation of the original geometry, localized at some radius in\nthe plane. This completely local and gauge invariant operator in the gauge theory maps\nto something non-local in the gravity dual.\n{ 9 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nTo localize the excitation in the geometry, we need to mix the indices of the operator\ncreating the excitations with the indices of the \felds making up the background in such a\nway that the boxes describing the excitation are only added at one location on the Young\ndiagram describing the original geometry [31{33]. We need to mix the gauge group indices\nof the excitation and the background to produce a local excitation. The details of how\nthese indices are mixed determines where the excitation is localized. We will not pursue\nthe problem of explicitly constructing operators which create localized excitations further.\n4 Localized closed string states\nUsing the lessons of the previous section, we will now write down operators dual to closed\nstring states localized on the LLM plane. We can write the loop operator as a linear\ncombination of restricted Schur polynomials labeled by a triple of Young diagrams using\nthe general result (2.6) which is true for any permutation \u001b. Our strategy is to write a local\nversion of the restricted Schur polynomial, and then use ( 2.6) to obtain local loops. We\nwill now motivate and explain our proposal for the localized version of a restricted Schur\npolynomial in the LLM backgrounds. Our arguments in what follows holds for general\nvalues of mand nC. For simplicity we will however often consider an example with m= 3\nand nC = 3 before stating the general result.\nConsider a restricted Schur polynomial with labels\nR= r= s= (4.1)\nThese would be summed (along with other possible restricted Schur polynomials) to pro-\nduce a loop operator with three Ys and three Zs. To completely specify the possible oper-\nators we need a multiplicity label since two copies of ; arise when we restrict to\nthe S3 \u0002S3 subgroup. We do the restriction by removing boxes from Rto leave r. The re-\nmoved boxes are then assembled to produce s. This way of embedding the representations\nthat appear is particularly convenient, since it allows us to associate the multiplicity label\nwith s matching the construction developed in [ 20]. Thus, the possible restricted Schur\npolynomials are\n\u001f\n( ; )\u000b\f\n\u000b;\f = 1;2(4.2)\nAs a consequence of the fact that two copies of ; arise, there are four possible op-\nerators we can de\fne. We want to write down local versions of these restricted Schur\npolynomials, in the background corresponding to Young diagram B given below. B corre-\nsponds to two concentric black rings surrounding a black disk. We will write down local\nversions of the above four operators localized around the outer edge of the middle ring.\nThese operators are again given by restricted Schur polynomials. R is replaced by the\nYoung diagram obtained by adjoining R to B in the appropriate location and similarly\nfor r. The new labels are denoted RB and rB. s is unchanged and since the problem of\n{ 10 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nassembling the boxes removed from RB to form shas exactly the same multiplicity as the\nproblem of assembling the boxes removed from Rto form swe assign it a multiplicity label\nthat takes the same values as the original label did. For the example we are considering\nwe have\nB = R= r= (4.3)\nand\nRB = rB = (4.4)\nAlthough all Young diagrams shown have a \fnite number of boxes, all row and column\nlengths would scale as N as we take the large N !1 limit.

Both sums\nabove run over all Young diagrams T `m+ nC, t`nC, u`m and the same multiplicity\nindex. We are interested in the limit in which nB \u0018N2 and nC \u0018\np\nN. We want to\ncompute the action of the dilatation operator on OB(fnkg). To accomplish this it is useful\nto simplify the above expression for OB(fnkg). The top most and left most box of R is\nadded to column c and row r of B. In the above example c= 6 and r= 8; in the limit we\nconsider both rand care of order N. Let r1 denote the length of the \frst row of B and let\nc1 denote the length of the \frst column of B. The \frst simpli\fcation we use comes from\nnoticing that, at large N we have\ndTBn!m!\ndtBdu(n+ m)! = hookstBhooksu\nhooksTB\n=\n\u0012 c1 \u0000r\nc1 \u0000r+ c\nr1 \u0000c\nr1 \u0000c+ r\n\u0013m hooksthooksu\nhooksT\n(1 + O(N\u00001))\n= \u0014mhooksthooksu\nhooksT\n(1 + O(N\u00001))(4.7)\n{ 11 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nThe precise form of \u0014does depend on the details of B. However, this is the only source of\nB dependence and the structure\ndTBn!m!\ndtBdu(n+ m)! = \u0014mhooksthooksu\nhooksT\n(1 + O(N\u00001))(4.8)\nholds for any B.5 The second simpli\fcation is in the value of the restricted character\n\u001fTB;(tB;u)\u000b\f(\u001b\u00001\nfnkg). Here we will see that the fact that \u001b\u00001\nfnkg is an nC + m cycle plays\na crucial role. In terms of the original loop operator in the original AdS 5\u0002S5 geometry,\nthis is equivalent to the statement that the loop operator is a single trace. To compute\nthe restricted character we will use a speci\fc representation of the symmetric group called\nYoung's orthogonal representation [43]. The answer does not depend on the representation\nwe use and we simply use this representation for convenience. Young's orthogonal represen-\ntation is de\fned by a rule which determines matrix elements of the matrices representing\nadjacent permutations, that is, permutations of the form ( i;i + 1). The adjacent permu-\ntations generate the complete group. The matrix elements for adjacent permutations are\nde\fned using the Young-Yamonouchi basis. In this basis, each box in the Young diagram\nis assigned a unique number. In our conventions, if the boxes are removed removing box\n1 \frst, box 2 second and so on, at each step one always obtains a valid Young diagram.\nThe collection of the labeled boxes is called a Young-Yamonouchi pattern, or more simply,\njust a pattern. In addition to the integer assigned by the pattern, each box is associated\nwith a second integer, called the content of the box. The box in row a and column b has\ncontent b\u0000a. The content of the box labeled iin the pattern is denoted ci. If ( i;i+ 1) acts\non a given state, it gives the same state back with coe\u000ecient 1\nci\u0000ci+1\nand it gives the state\nlabeled by the pattern with i and i+ 1 swapped, with coe\u000ecient\nq\n1 \u0000 1\n(ci\u0000ci+1)2 . Here is\nan example\n\u0000 ((12))\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\n5 3\n4 2\n1\n+\n= \u00001\n2\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\n5 3\n4 2\n1\n+\n+\np\n3\n2\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\n5 3\n4 1\n2\n+\n(4.9)\nNotice that if the di\u000berence in content between the two boxes scales asN i.e. ci\u0000ci+1 \u0018N,\nthen at large N the permutation ( i;i + 1) acting on a given pattern produces a linear\ncombination of states, one with a pattern given by swapping boxesiand i+1 in the original\npattern (with coe\u000ecient 1 + O(N\u00001)) and one with the original pattern (with coe\u000ecient\nO(N\u00001)). When we want to compute traces we are summing the diagonal elements of\nthe representation of a permutation, so that we often need to keep the terms with the\noriginal pattern, which is suppressed at large N. This observation was used to obtain the\nlarge N limit of the one loop dilatation operator in [ 20,44 ]. Using this representation,\n5Each corner in the Young diagram would be associated with a di\u000berent value for \u0014. For more than\none excitation, at more than one corner, we'd have a product of terms, one for each corner. The term for\na given corner is the value of \u0014 for that corner raised to the power of the number of Ys appearing in the\nexcitation at that corner.\n{ 12 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nconsider the computation of the restricted character \u001fTB;(tB;u)\u000b\f(\u001b\u00001\nfnkg), given by taking a\n(restricted) trace. Recall that our goal is to write down the local versions of the restricted\nSchur polynomials given in (4.2). These are to be summed to produce a loop operator with\nthree Ys and three Zs. The positions of the \frst three boxes to be removed (these are\nassociated with the Ys; they are the boxes that are assembled to produce s) are \fxed by\nthe shapes of R and r. After removing these \frst three boxes, we need to label a further\nthree boxes. This follows because \u001b\u00001\nfnkgdescribes a loop with three Ys and three Zs and is\nthus a six-cycle. All we need is the labels of the \frst six boxes in the Young-Yamonouchi\npattern if we are to evaluate the action of \u001b\u00001\nfnkg on the state. We could remove them all\nfrom the vicinity of the \frst three boxes (see the diagram on the left below) or we could\ninclude some more distant boxes (see the diagram on the right below for an example).\nRB =\n\u0003\u00032\n\u00031\n3\nRB =\n\u0003\n2\n1\n3\n\u0003\u0003 (4.10)\nThe important observation is that only states of the form given in the diagram on the left\nabove contribute. Concretely, after acting with \u001b\u00001\nfnkgon the states of the form given in the\ndiagram on the right above, we always \fnd (at the leading order in largeN) that some of the\n\frst mlabels (given in our example by 1,2,3) are transported into the distant boxes. This\nfollows from the fact that (i) the di\u000berence in content between the distant boxes and the\n\frst mboxes is order N and hence (ii) in Young's orthogonal representation, transpositions\nbetween the \frst m and the remaining boxes always transport local boxes to the location\nof the distant boxes. These states will not contribute to the trace because the overlap of\nthe state with the original box locations and the state with some local boxes swapped with\ndistant boxes vanishes. Thus, the trace only receives contributions from states of the form\ngiven in the diagram on the left above. The contribution from the states of the form given\nin the diagram on the right above are of order N\u00001. In general, the m+nC cycle \\ties\" the\nnC + m labeled boxes together. This forces the nC Z boxes (which might have appeared\nin any distant corner of RB) to sit adjacent to the Y boxes.

The states of the type shown in ( 4.11) are written as j^RB;aiwith\na= 1;:::;d RdB and jR;aiwith a= 1;:::;d R respectively.

The arguments of this section motivate the fact that for the operators we pro-\npose, this is not the case. The reason why some of the Zs are treated di\u000berently is quite\ntransparent in our analysis: the permutation \u001b\u00001\nfnkg has tied some of the Z \felds with the\nY \felds. The Ys are localized on the Young diagram, so that the Zs tied to the Ys will be\nlocalized to this region too. This is rather natural as these \felds are supposed to constitute\na single object: the closed string. Recall that the number of Zs in the closed string is nC\nand the number of Zs in the background is nB. Thanks to the permutation \u001b\u00001\nfnkg, the \frst\nm+ nC labeled boxes are localized on RB. rB is \flled with patterns that label states in\nan irreducible representation of SnC+nB = Sn while ^rB is \flled with patterns that label\nstates in an irreducible representation of SnC \u0002SnB. These are two very di\u000berent things.\nFor further discussion of these localized restricted Schur polynomials, see appendix A .\n6This follows from the fact that the action of a group element depends only on the di\u000berences of the\ncontent in the labeled boxes, and these di\u000berences are equal for the two states appearing in ( 4.11).\n{ 14 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\n5 LLM magnons\nIn this section we would like to evaluate the action of the one loop dilatation operator\non our proposed localized loops in the LLM background B. Our goal is to compute the\none loop anomalous dimension of the localized loop, a quantity that can be compared to\nenergies in the dual string theory, to either support or rule out our proposal.

The one loop dilatation operator action was derived when\nacting on a restricted Schur polynomial, ORB;(rB;s)\u00161;\u00162(Z;Y ). Above we are acting on\nO^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162\n(Z;Y ). By thinking of O^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162\n(Z;Y ) as a linear combination of re-\nstricted Schur polynomials, it is straightforward to repeat the derivation given in [ 30].\nThere are two possible swaps that contribute. The \frst swap is of the form (1 ;m + 1)\nwhich acts on a Y slot and a Z slot which belongs to the localized loop; this is the per-\nmutation that appears in ( 5.1). The second swap is of the form (1 ;m + nC + 1) and it\nacts on a Y slot and a Z slot which belongs to the background; it gives a contribution\nthat is suppressed in the large N limit and so we drop it. This follows from the fact that\nm+ nC + 1 must appear in a corner, and after stripping o\u000b the \frst m+ nC boxes, the\nonly corners remaining are distant. In this way we learn that ( 5.1) is not exact: use of\nthe large N limit has been made to discard a speci\fc interaction between the background\nand the loop.\nTo make further progress, we need to study the matrix elementsN^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162;T;(t;u)\u00171\u00172\n.\nOur \frst task is to characterize the labels T;(t;u)\u00172\u00171 of operators that contribute in (5.1).\nThe intertwiner IT0R0\nB\nis only non-zero when RB and T di\u000ber by the placement of at most\none box | it is only in this case that a non-zero map can be de\fned. To proceed further,\nwe need a little more notation. Speci\fcally, we need to spell out which slots in the re-\nstricted Schur polynomial are associated to which representations.

Knowing the value of the Casimir associated\nto a given conjugacy class when acting on any state belonging to a particular represen-\ntation is equivalent to knowing the value of the character in the representation for the\nrelevant conjugacy class. Knowing the value of all the Casimirs is equivalent to knowing\nthe complete set of characters, which speci\fes the representation completely. Denoting the\nstate labeled by a in some representation R (not necessarily an irrep) we have\nCijR;ai= \u0015R\ni jR;ai (5.4)\nWe get the same value of \u0015R\ni no matter what state (i.e. what value of a) we act on and\nknowing the complete set of \u0015R\ni s allows us to determine R completely, up to equivalence.\nConsider the trace we wish to compute\nTr\n\u0010\u0002\n(1;m + 1);P ^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162\n\u0003\nIR0\nBT0\n\u0002\n(1;m + 1);PT;(t;u)\u00172\u00171\n\u0003\nIT0R0\nB\n\u0011\n= Tr\n\u0010\n(1;m + 1)P^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162\nIR0\nBT0(1;m + 1);PT;(t;u)\u00172\u00171IT0R0\nB\n\u0011\n+ ::: (5.5)\nThere are three more terms in the dots above.

The \fnal equality uses (5.8).\nThus, we have learned that if \u0015rB(a)0\ni 6= \u0015t(b)0\ni , or equivalently if rB(a)06= t(b)0we have\nTr\n\u0010\n(1;m + 1)Pa\n^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162\nIR0\nBT0(1;m + 1)Pb\nT;(t;u)\u00172\u00171IT0R0\nB\n\u0011\n= 0(5.11)\nNow, writing\nTr\n\u0010\n(1;m + 1)P^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162\nIR0\nBT0(1;m + 1)PT;(t;u)\u00172\u00171IT0R0\nB\n\u0011\n=\nX\na\nX\nb\nTr\n\u0010\n(1;m + 1)Pa\n^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162\nIR0\nBT0(1;m + 1)Pb\nT;(t;u)\u00172\u00171IT0R0\nB\n\u0011\n(5.12)\nwe learn that the trace vanishes unless rB and tdi\u000ber by at most the placement of a single\nbox. We can re\fne this analysis further. In constructing the operator O^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162\n(Z;Y ),\nwe know that not all states inrB participate: only the states in the irrep (r;B) of SnC\u0002SnB\nparticipate. Our shorthand for \\states in the irrep ( r;B) of SnC \u0002SnB\" is ^rB. We will\ndemonstrate that t also belongs to an SnC \u0002SnB representation.

Finally, using the\nCasimirs CnC\u00001\ni and Cm\u00001\ni we can argue that r and t as well s and u di\u000ber by at most\nthe placement of a single box. So, the mixing problem is tightly constrained: operators\nO^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162\n(Z;Y ) (using irrep ( B;r;s ) of the subgroup SnB \u0002SnC \u0002Sm) only mix with\noperators O^TB;(^tB;u)\u00171\u00172\n(Z;Y ) (using irrep (B;t;u ) of the subgroup) if the Young diagrams\nin the pairs s;u, as well as r;t and R;T di\u000ber by at most the placement of a single box.\nA comment is in order. In the previous section we have proposed operators dual to\nlocal excitations on some background geometry. Our proposal puts the \felds belonging\nto the background into one representation and the \felds belonging to the excitation into\na second representation. The result we have obtained above shows that the dilatation\noperator, which is to be identi\fed with the Hamiltonian of the excitation, respects this\nstructure: only operators that have this same make-up, with the same representation for\nthe background, mix. This is support in favor of our construction.\nSince TB and RB can di\u000ber by at most one block we need to consider the following\npossibility\nRB = TB = (5.15)\ni.e. TB has a distant box added. If this is a Y box, we will have\ntB = (5.16)\ni.e. tB has no distant boxes. Since the box we must drop is a Y box, the swap (1 ;m+1)\nappearing in ( 5.5) must leave the boxes inert, and this immediately implies that this di-\nlatation operator matrix element is of order N\u00001. This proves that under the action of the\ndilatation operator, none of the Y boxes are transported to distant locations on the Young\ndiagram. Since the distant box in TB is a Z box, we will have\ntB = (5.17)\n{ 18 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nWe have now learned enough about the matrix elements N^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162; ^TB;(^tB;u)\u00171\u00172\nthat we\ncan consider the action of the dilatation operator on a localized loop\nDOB(fnkg) =\nX\nR;(r;s)\u00161\u00162\ns\nfRBhooksrBhooksu\nhooksRB\n\u001f^RB;(^rB;s)\u00162\u00161\n(\u001b\u00001\nfnkg)DO^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162\n(Z;Y )\n=\nX\nR;(r;s)\u00161\u00162\nX\nT;(t;u)\u00171\u00172\ns\nfRBhooksrBhooksu\nhooksRB\n\u001f^RB;(^rB;s)\u00162\u00161\n(\u001b\u00001\nfnkg)\n\u0002N^RB;(^rB;s)\u00161\u00162; ^TB;(^tB;u)\u00171\u00172\nO^TB;(^tB;u)\u00171\u00172\n(Z;Y )\n= \u0000g2\nYM\n8\u00192\nmX\np=1\nm+nX\nq=m+1\nX\nT+;t;u;\u00171\u00172\nX\nT\ncT+T\nhooksT\nhooksT+\ns\nfTBhookstBhooksu\nhooksTB\n\u0002dB\u001fT+;(t;u; )\u00171\u00172( \u00001)O^TB;(^tB;u)\u00172\u00171\n(Z;Y )(5.18)\nwhere to get the last line above we have made use of the identity proved in appendix B .\nFocus on the character \u001fT+;(t;u; )\u00171\u00172( \u00001). There is an extra box in T+ that must be\ndropped to obtain T. The permutation  depends on p and q. If the permutation  \u00001\nconsists of cycles that mix the indices of the local \felds with the possible distant Z box,\nthen we know by the arguments of section 4 that these contributions can be dropped at\nlarge N. In appendix B we argue that  \u00001 has two cycles, one of length k and one of\nlength nC + m+ 1 \u0000k. The distant box will not be suppressed as long as it appears in a\ncycle that does not tie it to any local boxes. There are only two such terms. At large N,\nthere are mnC = O(N) terms appearing on the right hand side of ( 5.18), so that this is a\nsubleading contribution. This proves that at large N, any terms with a distant Z box can\nbe neglected. Our argument has demonstrated that only local loop operators, as we have\nde\fned them, contribute.

We will compare\nthe gauge theory and the string theory for localized loops located in the three regions\npossible. For the gauge theory prediction we need the value of Ne\u000b which is given by the\nfactors of the boxes labeled in \fgure2 . The factor of the box labeled iis denoted N(i)\ne\u000b with\nN(1)\ne\u000b = N + c1 + c2; N (2)\ne\u000b = N + c1 \u0000r1; N (3)\ne\u000b = N \u0000r1 \u0000r2 (5.27)\n{ 20 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nFigure 2. A Young diagram Bwhich corresponds to the LLM background with boundary condition\nshown in \fgure3 . The number of rows and columns de\fning B as well as N are shown.\nNoting that N = r1 + r2 + r3 these can also be written as\nN(1)\ne\u000b = r1 + r2 + r3 + c1 + c2; N (2)\ne\u000b = r2 + r3 + c1; N (3)\ne\u000b = r3 (5.28)\nThese factors have a very natural geometrical interpretation in the dual gravity. The sim-\nplest way to map between the LLM boundary condition and the Young diagram describing\nthe background is through the use of the free fermion language [ 10]. The LLM boundary\ncondition is a picture of the phase space of N non-interacting fermions in an external har-\nmonic oscillator potential. The central disk is a number of fermions (set by the area of the\ncentral disk divided by \u0019=N) that have not been excited. The inner black annulus is some\nnumber of fermions (set by the area of this annulus divided by \u0019=N) each excited by the\nsame amount (set by the area of the inner white annulus divided by \u0019=N). Finally, the\nouter black annulus is some number of fermions (set by the area of this annulus divided\nby \u0019=N), with each again excited by the same amount (set by the area of the outer white\nannulus divided by \u0019=N). The Young diagram is a picture of the same thing. Each row\ncorresponds to a fermion. The number of boxes in any given row is equal to the amount\nby which this fermion is excited. Using this dictionary, we see that the central disk has\nan area of \u0019r3=N and hence a radius squared of r3=N. Similarly, the inner black annulus\nhas an outer radius squared of ( r3 + c1 + r2)=N while the outer black annulus has an outer\nradius squared of (r1 + r2 + r3 + c1 + c2)=N. Thus, the radius (squared) on the LLM plane\nat which the loop is localized is set by the factor of the box divided by N.\nWith these basics set up, lets now recall the string theory result [8]. For well separated\nmagnons, each magnon transforms in a de\fnite SU(2 j2)2 representation. The closed string\ntransforms as the tensor product of the individual magnon representations. To specify\nthe representation of a magnon, we specify the central charges appearing in the SU(2 j2)2\nalgebra. Think of the LLM plane as a complex plane. Each magnon corresponds to a\n{ 21 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nFigure 3. This is the LLM boundary condition corresponding to the Young diagram given in\n\fgure2 . The central black disk has area equal to \u0019r3 and hence a radius of pr3.\ndirected line segment on this plane. Every directed line segment is equivalent to a complex\nnumber, k with phase given by the direction of the line segment and magnitude given by\nthe length of the line segment. The magnitude of k is the length of the line corresponding\nto the magnon. The energy of the magnon is determined by supersymmetry to be\nE =\np\n1 + 2g2jkj2 = 1 + g2jkj2 + ::: (5.29)\nFor a magnon which subtends an angle \u0012 we have jkj= 4R2 sin2 \u0012\n2 with R the radius at\nwhich the closed string is localized. The angle \u0012 is identi\fed with the momentum p of the\nmagnon [ 8]. As we have just discussed, R2 = Ne\u000b\nN so that there is a perfect agreement\nbetween the gauge theory result ( 5.26) and the order g2 contribution to the string theory\nresult (5.29): our proposal for operators dual to localized closed string states is correct.\n6 Another example and another method\nThe above results suggest that the only e\u000bect of working on an LLM background is to\nreplace g2\nYMN !g2\nYMNe\u000b. As we have just seen, this replacement in the gauge theory\nreproduces the central charge predicted by the string theory analysis. In this section we\nwant to explore what is perhaps the simplest setting in which this conclusion can be probed\n| simple enough that we can do it without any restricted Schur polynomial technology.\nThis problem was considered in [46] and this section is just a quick review of those results.\nWe will con\frm our g2\nYMN !g2\nYMNe\u000b conclusion for this simple example.\nConsider a background \u001fB(Z) with B a Young diagram that has N rows and M\ncolumns, with M of order N. We write\n\u001fB(Z) = (det(Z))M : (6.1)\nThe corresponding LLM boundary condition is a single black annulus hugging a central\nwhite disk of area \u0019M=N. The simplicity of this example is due to two facts:\n1.We have the well known formula for the derivative of a determinant\n@\n@Zi\nj\n\u001fB(Z) = M(Z\u00001)j\ni\u001fB(Z) : (6.2)\n{ 22 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\n2.In this background, multiplying by a trace is a local operation. The background looks\nlike a single annulus, so there is only one outer edge. As a consequence, our local\nloops are\nO(fnkg))\u001fB(Z)(6.3)\nThus, we can write\nD\u001fB(Z)O(fnkg)) = \u001fB(Z)De\u000bO(fnkg)(6.4)\nwhere\nDe\u000b = 1\n\u001fB(Z)D\u001fB(Z) = D\u0000Mg2\nYM\n8\u00192 Tr\n\u0012\u0000\nZYZ \u00001 + Z\u00001YZ \u00002Y\n\u0001 @\n@Y\n\u0013\n(6.5)\nIt is now simple to see that\nDe\u000bO(fnkg)(6.6)\n= g2\nYM(N+M)\n8\u00192 (2O(fnkg) \u0000O(fn1+1;n2\u00001;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;nmg) \u0000O(fn1\u00001;n2+1;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;nmg))\n+g2\nYM(N + M)\n8\u00192\n\u0010\n2O(fnkg) \u0000O(fn1;n2+1;n3\u00001;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;nmg)\n\u0000O(fn1;n2\u00001;n3+1;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;nmg)\n\u0011\n...\n+g2\nYM(N+M)\n8\u00192 (2O(fnkg) \u0000O(fn1\u00001;n2;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;nm+1g) \u0000O(fn1+1;n2;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;nm\u00001g))\nSince for this B we have Ne\u000b = N+ M, this is in perfect agreement with our expectations.\n7 Excitations on the inner edge of an annulus\nThe loops we have constructed have been localized on the outer edge of a black disk or\nannulus on the LLM plane. These excitations are created by adding boxes to inwardly\npointing corners of the Young diagram describing the background. It is also interesting to\nconstruct loops that are localized on the inner edge of a black annulus. The inner edges\ncorrespond to outwardly pointing corners of the Young diagram describing the background.\nIt is not possible to add boxes at these corners; it is possible to remove boxes. Thus, it is\nnatural to describe these excitations by removing boxes. Indeed, to orbit on the inner edge\nof a black ring these excitations must have negative the angular momentum carried by a\nKK graviton dual to Z. Thus these excitations must have an opposite Rcharge to that of\nZ; for each box we remove we do indeed decrease the Rcharge by 1. One could also have\nconsidered including Zys in the operator, which also decrease the Rcharge by 1. However,\nincluding Zys in the background also increases the dimension and takes us out of the class\nof 1\n2 BPS backgrounds. \\Empty box gravitons\" have been studied in [ 31] where they were\ncalled \\countergravitons\". In appendix C we have worked out enough details that we have\nindeed con\frmed this expectation. Using the resulting loop operators we again reproduce\nthe string theory expectations.\n{ 23 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nFigure 4. The string worldsheet on the left above corresponds to an integrable anomalous di-\nmension problem in the dual gauge theory. The problem on the right doesn't. Conservation of\nmomentum implies the angle swept out by the magnons is the same before and after scattering.\nEnergy conservation is more di\u000ecult to describe geometrically. At very strong coupling it says\nthat the sum of the lengths of the magnons scattering is the same before and after scattering. It\nis clear that scattering of magnons for the worldsheet on the left is elastic. For the worldsheet on\nthe right, when a magnon with endpoints on edges of di\u000berent rings scatters, the scattering is in\ngeneral inelastic.\n8 Conclusions\nIn this article we have constructed operators dual to closed string states probing an LLM\ngeometry. We have not described the most general LLM geometry: we have focused on\ngeometries arising when we color the LLM plane with O(1) concentric rings. Further,\nwe have computed the one loop anomalous dimensions of these operators. Although our\ncomputations are quite technical the \fnal result is remarkably simple: the action of the\ndilatation operator in the nontrivial geometry is given by simply scaling the N dependence\nin the planar result. We have only argued this at one loop, but we expect this to go through\nfor higher loops. Indeed, at k loops, using the Casimir arguments developed in section 5 ,\nwe know that at most kboxes can shift position on the Young diagram and further that the\nbackground, labeled by Young diagram B, is not changed. In this case, we again recover\nthe planar dilatation operator but with N scaled as it was at one loop level. The intuition\ncoming from the SU(2j2)2 symmetry of the problem also supports this conclusion. Indeed,\nfrom the one loop anomalous dimension we can read o\u000b the central charge of the magnon\nand, thanks to supersymmetry, this completely determines the energy of the magnon.\nFor a closed string state described by a polygon with all vertices on the outer edge\nof a single ring, magnon scattering is again elastic and the problem is integrable. The\nspectrum of anomalous dimensions and even the expressions for the exact eigenstates can\nall be obtained from the answers in the planar limit by simply replacing N with Ne\u000b.\nThere are also closed string states with vertices located on the outer edges of distinct rings.\nFor these the magnon scattering problem is not elastic and the problem is not integrable.\nHowever, thanks to the SU(2j2)2 symmetry, the two body S-matrix can still be determined\nexactly, up to a phase. It would be interesting to construct these S-matrices and verify their\ndynamical content. For example, the poles of these S-matrices should contain information\nabout the boundstate spectrum of the theory [ 47].\n{ 24 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nPrevious studies of restricted Schur polynomials have focused on operators dual to\nstates in the trivial AdS 5\u0002S5 background. In this article we have carried out a detailed\nstudy involving operators dual to states in a non-trivial geometry. What lessons have we\nlearned from this study? Our construction of localized operators has involved a new in-\ngredient which has not featured in any previous constructions: the Z \felds belonging to\nthe background have not been treated on the same footing as the Z \felds belonging to\nthe closed string excitation. In the SU(2) sector all previous constructions of restricted\nSchur polynomials have made use of the subgroup Sn \u0002Sm \u001aSn+m. The subgroup Sn\npermutes indices belonging to Zs while Sm permutes indices belonging to Ys. The con-\nstruction developed in this paper makes use of the subgroup SnB \u0002SnC \u0002Sm \u001aSn+m when\nconstructing operators in the SU(2) sector. The subgroup SnB permutes indices belonging\nto the Zs making up the background, SnC permutes indices of Zs belonging to the closed\nstring and Sm permutes indices belonging to Ys. Thus, the distinction between what is\nthe background and what is the excitation is accomplished in the choice of the subgroup\nand its representations. This provides a concrete proposal for the gauge theory mechanism\nto distinguish between \\background\" and \\\ructuation\". As a test of this proposal, we can\ntry to determine where this construction breaks down and see if it matches our intuition.\nThe geometries we have studied arise from a boundary condition that consists of O(1) fat\nblack rings. This is a geometry that is smooth on the string scale and we expect back\nreaction by stringy probes is negligible. This is consistent with the fact that changes in the\nbackground Young diagramBare suppressed in the large N limit. We could also consider a\nbackground B described by a Young diagram with O(N) corners. The boundary condition\nfor this geometry is a set of N very thin rings, giving rise to a geometry that has nontrivial\nfeatures, even on the string scale. We expect that this detailed and intricate geometry is\ndisturbed by a stringy probe. In this case there are so many outward pointing corners, that\nnot all of them can be well separated from the local excitation. In this case, the dilatation\noperator will start to mix operators with distinct background Young diagrams B, even at\nlarge N. Consequently, taking N !1 will no longer suppress backreaction, and we see\nthat our gauge theory mechanism to distinguish between \\background\" and \\\ructuation\"\nhas failed precisely where we would expect it to.\nAlthough small deformations of the 1\n2 -BPS sector are special, this sector of the theory\nmay provide insight into more generic situations [51]. For example, the presence of a horizon\nin the geometry signi\fes a region of high entropy | proportional to the horizon area. To\nobtain a large entropy we need con\fgurations that support many almost equivalent but\ndi\u000berent excitations, that could provide the microstates responsible for this entropy. It\nis natural to associate this with a region on the Young diagram that has many corners,\nsince the number of possible excitations is related to the number of representations of\nthe subgroup we can subduce, and this is related to the number of boxes we can remove.\nIndeed, the typical state in the 1\n2 -BPS sector has O(N) corners [ 51]. For an excitation\n\fnding itself in this \\corner rich\" region, there are many outward pointing corners nearby\nthe local excitation, so that it will spread over this region as time evolves. This has the\npotential to provide a natural \feld theory origin for tidal forces and even the longitudinal\nstring spreading e\u000bects experienced at the horizon (see for example [ 52]). With some\n{ 25 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nthought we expect that simple computations, to provide a quantitative interrogation for\nthis identi\fcation, are possible.\nIt would seem to be straight forward to consider giant graviton excitations of these\nLLM geometries. It appears that the arguments that work for the closed string excitations\nwill go through, without modi\fcation, for the giants. It would be interesting to check the\ndetails and verify that this is indeed the case.\nActing with \u001fB(Z) on the vacuum produces the state that corresponds to the LLM\nbackground spacetime. The loop O(fnkg) operator creates a single closed string state in\nthe AdS5\u0002S5 spacetime; it may have been natural to expect that acting with O(fnkg) on\nthe state corresponding to the LLM geometry would produce a string probing the LLM\nspacetime. This is not the case: as we have seen, the product O(fnkg)\u001fB(Z) does not\nproduce a closed string localized on the background spacetime. However, taking a product\nof the representation describing the background and the representation describing the ex-\ncitation does indeed give the representation relevant for describing a closed string localized\non the LLM spacetime. The resulting operator involves a highly nontrivial mixing of the\nindices of the Z \felds belonging to the background and Z \felds belonging to the excitation\nin the operator. The simplest description of this mixing is in terms of the representations\ninvolved, so that the representation theory description of the problem furnishes a very\nnatural language. We have also seen that the action of the dilatation operator is written\nin terms of the value of the factor at the location on the Young diagram RB where the\nexcitation is added. This factor, which is a representation theoretic quantity, is related to\nthe radius squared at which the excitation orbits on the LLM plane, a geometric quantity.\nIn studies of open strings attached to giant gravitons [27,48 {50], each giant graviton is de-\nscribed by a long row or column and each open string is associated with a box on the Young\ndiagram. The strength of the open string end point interactions is set by the factor of this\nbox [49,50 ]. Comparisons with a magnon description again gives exact agreement, with\nthe factors combining to exactly reproduce the magnon energy in the dual string theory\ndescription [12]. It is striking how natural the language constructed using representation\ntheory and Young diagrams is.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is based upon research supported by the South African Research Chairs Initiative\nof the Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation.

If we restrict to the SU(2) sector of the theory, these polynomials are labeled\nby three Young diagrams and two multiplicity labels \u001fR;(r;s)\u00161\u00162(Z;Y ). In this study our\ngoal has been to understand how we can describe perturbations around a nontrivial LLM\n{ 26 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nspacetime geometry. Our results imply that one can write down \\local restricted Schur\npolynomials\" which provide a basis for such excitations. The background is described\nby a Young diagram B with order N2 boxes. In the SU(2) sector of the theory, the\nperturbation can again be labeled by three Young diagrams and two multiplicity labels\nR;(r;s)\u00161\u00162. An economical way to summarize the construction of section 4 is to notice\nthat the localized restricted Schur polynomial uses representations 8 of SnB+nC+m and of\nthe subgroup SnB \u0002SnC \u0002Sm. In terms of this language, we can write the localized\nrestricted Schur polynomial as\nO^TB;(^tB;u)\f\u000b(Z;Y ) = OTB;(B;T;t;u)\f\u000b(Z;Y )(A.1)\nIn the above formula the triple of Young diagrams B;t;u label an irrep of SnB \u0002SnC \u0002Sm.\nThe labels \f\u000b as well as T are multiplicity labels. We have seen that taking a product\nof the operator describing the closed string and the operator describing the background\ngeometry does not produce the desired closed string on the background spacetime. In\nthe operators ( A.1) there is a simple tensor product between the representation (of SnB)\ndescribing the background the representation (of Sm \u0002SnC) describing the excitation.\nThis simple tensor product generates highly nontrivial mixing of the indices of the Z \felds\nbelonging to the background and Z \felds belonging to the excitation in the operator (A.1).\nA number of identities valid for the restricted Schur polynomials also hold for the local\nrestricted Schur polynomials. The most important identity of this type is the complete-\nness of local restricted characters in a speci\fc background B. The usual identity for the\ncompleteness of restricted characters, obtained in [ 28], reads (r`n and s`m)\nX\nR;(r;s)\u000b\f\ndR\ndrds(n+ m)!\u001fR;(r;s)\u000b\f(\u001c)\u001fR;(r;s)\f\u000b(\u001b) = \u000e[\u001b][\u001c] (A.2)\nThe delta function on the right hand side is 1 if we can satisfy\n\u001a\u001c\u001a\u00001 = \u001b (A.3)\nfor some \u001a2Sn \u0002Sm. The completeness of the local restricted characters reads\nX\nR;(r;s)\u000b\f\ndR\ndrds(n+ m)!\u001f^RB;(^rB;s)\u000b\f(\u001c)\u001f^RB;(^rB;s)\f\u000b(\u001b) = d2\nB\u000e[\u001b][\u001c] (A.4)\nwhere \u001b;\u001c 2SnC+m and the delta function on the right hand side is 1 if we can satisfy\n\u001a\u001c\u001a\u00001 = \u001b (A.5)\nfor some \u001a 2 SnC \u0002Sm. Notice that in ( A.4) the permutations \u001b;\u001c act only on the\nboxes belonging to the excitation and the orthogonality in the permutations is achieved\neven though we only sum over the excitation labels. It is completeness within a \fxed\nbackground B.\n8Recall that there are nB Z \felds making up the background geometry and nC + m \felds in the loop.\n{ 27 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nB Restricted character identities\nIn this section we would like to derive the exact identity for restricted characters, that\nreduces to (2.14) in the planar limit.

As we explained in\nsection4 , this cycle \\ties\" the Z and Y boxes together. Since the Y boxes are concentrated\nin one location on the Young diagram, the Z boxes will be concentrated there too. The\noriginal localized loop is de\fned using a permutation \u001bthat is an m+nC cycle; this implies\nthat all of the \felds belonging to the local excitation will be concentrated at one location\non the Young diagram. We want to explore the cycle structure of  \u00001 which will determine\nwhether or not the boxes associated to the closed string in (B.11) are localized or not, i.e. if\nthe dilatation operator acts on a localized loop operator, does it produce another localized\nloop operator?\n and  \u00001 have the same cycle structure, so we can focus on  .  is a sum of four\nterms that are conjugate to (and hence have the same cycle structure as) the following four\npermutations\n\u001b(p;q)(m+ n+ 1;q) ( p;q)\u001b(m+ n+ 1;q)\n(m+ n+ 1;q)\u001b(p;q) ( m+ n+ 1;q)(p;q)\u001b (B.12)\nThe permutation \u001b is an m+ nC cycle. Permutations ( p;q)\u001b and \u001b(p;q) correspond to a\nproduct of a k cycle with an nC + m+ 1 \u0000k cycle with k = 1;2;\u0001\u0001\u0001 nC + m.9 The value\nof k depends on the value of p and q. The sum over p and q produces O(N) terms. There\nare only O(1) terms of a speci\fc k, so the contribution for any given \fxed k can safely be\nneglected in the large N limit. The k= 1 term is enhanced with a factor of N; this is the\nterm that dominates the planar limit. Multiplying by the two cycle ( m+ n+ 1;q) does not\ninduce any further splitting because m+ n+ 1 does not appear in \u001b or (p;q). In section 5\nwe argued that localization of the Y boxes after the dilatation operator acts is guaranteed.\nFurther, localization of all but one Z box is also guaranteed. The way that this simple box\ncan move to a distant location is if k= 1 and the label of the distant box sits in the 1-cycle\nin (p;q)\u001b or \u001b(p;q). As we have just explained, this term can be neglected at large N so\nthat the dilatation operator only mixes localized loop operators.\nB.1 Numerical check\nThe formula ( B.10) is rather interesting as it is the exact one loop dilatation operator\nwritten in the trace basis. Such a formula has not been written in the literature before and\n9The planar contribution comes from the term with k = 1 of the form (1)( \u0001\u0001\u0001 ) with ( \u0001\u0001\u0001 ) an nC + m\ncycle.\n{ 30 {\nJHEP03(2016)110\nit will provide a useful starting point for other large N but not planar expansions. Indeed,\nwe have used it for precisely this purpose in the LLM backgrounds. Given the potential\nusefulness of such a formula, we have checked it numerically, for n= 3 Zs and m= 2 Ys.\nIn the case m= 2 we do not need multiplicity labels and this simpli\fes the computations\nsigni\fcantly.\nEvaluating restricted characters.

We would like to remove Z boxes and organize them with a representation r`n,\nadd Y boxes organized with a representation s`m and then organize the Y and Z boxes\nwith a representation R`m+ n.

Thus, four irreps play a role: s `m organizing the Ys, r `n organizing the\nempty boxes and B=R organizing the Z \felds left in the background and B the original\nbackground irrep. To spell out how the di\u000berent irreps are embedded in B, remove the\nempty boxes \frst and then remove theY boxes. This implies that there are no multiplicities\nfor either r (thanks to fact that we are considering an outward pointing corner) or B=R\n(always the case); the only multiplicity label needed is for Y so the multiplicity labels\ntake the same values as they did for the restricted Schur polynomial.

Indeed, the label for the empty boxes is simply a short\nhand and we can easily translate these labels into the usual description in terms of a\nrepresentation for the Z \felds and one for the Y \felds. This translation is given in ( C.11).\nThis translation is nontrivial. For example, one may have expected that the operator built\nusing no empty slots and only Ys is BPS. This is not the case. A very simple example of\nthis is (in this example no multiplicity labels are needed)\nD\u001fB;(B= ;\u0001; )(Z;Y; 1) = g2\nYMM\n4\u00192 \u001fB;(B= ;\u0001; )(Z;Y; 1) \u0000g2\nYMM\n4\u00192 \u001f\nB;(B= ;\u0001; )\n(Z;Y; 1)\n(C.13)\nOur main interest is in de\fning localized loop operators in this background.

In our previous formulas,\nZ\u00001 did not participate. As soon as we have more than N \felds, there are trace relations\nso that in this case there isn't a unique expression for generic multitrace operators, so this\napparent discrepancy should not worry us.

Further,\nwe see that N is replaced by M which again reproduces the string theory expectations.\nC.4 More general backgrounds\nTo construct localized restricted Schur Polynomials with empty boxes on the general mul-\ntiring geometry, we need to use localized derivative operators, that only remove boxes from\na single corner of B. Derivatives of this type have been de\fned and studied in [ 31]. Re-\nplacing N by the factor of the outward pointing corner again reproduces the string theory\nexpectations.\nOpen Access.
