This review coincides with the release of a version, FRAXplus, which addresses some of these limitations.\nKeywords FRAX · Fractures · Calculator · Osteoporosis · Fracture risk · Epidemiology\nIntroduction\nIn this review, we explore the literature around osteoporosis \nand how FRAX has changed its management.\nOsteoporosis: definition and diagnosis\nOsteoporosis, although first used to characterise post-mor -\ntem bones with hollow spaces in 1820, was first defined \nfrom a consensus group in 1993 as ‘a systemic skeletal \ndisease characterised by low bone mass and microarchi-\ntectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent \nincrease in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture’. \nDual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was approved \nfor the measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) by the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1988 [ 1]. A few \nyears later, osteoporosis was defined by a WHO Working \nGroup in densitometric terms as a BMD that was 2.5 stand-\nard deviations (SD) or more below the mean value of young \nhealthy women, i.e., a T-score <− 2.5 SD [2]. This threshold \nwould classify 30% of all postmenopausal women as hav -\ning osteoporosis [3 ]. Osteopenia was defined as a T-score \nbetween − 1.0 and − 2.5. The recommended reference range \nis the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination \nSurvey (NHANES III) database for femoral neck in white \nwomen aged 20–29 years [4, 5]. As per its definition, osteo-\nporosis increases the risk for fractures. Major osteoporotic \nfractures were defined as those at the hip, clinical spine, \nforearm, and proximal humerus as they account for about \n80% of the fractures and the majority of the economic bur -\nden. Moreover, these fractures are strongly associated with \nlow BMD, are predictive of future fractures, and display an \nage-dependent pattern [6].\nThe BMD-based threshold for osteoporosis, while serv -\ning a critical role in clinical diagnosis and management of \nosteoporosis, has several limitations which compromise its \nutility in identifying patients who go on to experience an \n * M.

The most important one is that although \nBMD has a high specificity, its sensitivity is low [2 ] and \nthe majority of fractures (60–70%) occur in individuals \nwithout osteoporosis [7 ]. BMD might not be available or \nnot reliable, either due to limited access to facilities or due \nto individual patient issues (degenerative changes at the \nspine, hip replacements etc.). Moreover, the significance \nof any given T-score threshold differs by age (Fig.  1). A \nT-score of − 2.5 in a woman age 65 years denotes a modest \nincrease in the probability of fracture when compared to \na woman with no clinical risk factors whose BMD is not \navailable. With increasing age, the difference in the prob-\nability between those with T-score of − 2.5 and the general \npopulation decreases, and at older ages, for example from \nthe age of 78 years upwards in the United States (Fig. 1), the \nfracture probability progressively decreases compared to the \nage- and sex-matched general population and a T-score of \n− 2.5 becomes a protective factor [8 ]. Furthermore, many \nclinical risk factors do not act solely via BMD, and thus may \nprovide further independent contribution to risk stratification \n[9]. Finally, fracture rates differ between countries, and the \nvariations cannot be explained by BMD alone. For example, \nthe T-score corresponding to a 10-year major osteoporotic \nfracture probability of 20% varies from − 4.6 in Venezuela \nto − 2.0 in Iceland [8].\nIn summary, it is apparent that BMD does not capture the \nlikelihood of fracture completely. This has led to the adverse \nconsequence that patients at high fracture risk for non-BMD \nreasons have been denied appropriate treatment, because \nthe threshold for densitometric osteoporosis has not been \nreached. There have been discussions whether the defini-\ntion of osteoporosis should be reconsidered to include frac-\ntures [10, 11]. However, there are problems with including \noutcomes in multifactorial diseases. There are parallels with \nother multifactorial diseases like stroke. Blood pressure, a \nknown risk factor for stroke, is a continuous variable like \nBMD, but not all patients with stroke have hypertension. It \nwould be inappropriate to define hypertension on the basis \nof stroke. The same applies to myocardial infarction and \nhypercholesterolaemia [12]. A change in the BMD defini-\ntion might not be widely adopted so it was recently proposed \nthat it be retained for now and a distinction be made between \ndiagnostic and intervention thresholds [12]. In an effort to \naddress the insensitivity of BMD for the identification of \nindividuals who go on to experience a fracture, risk calcu-\nlators have been developed which use clinical risk factors \nplus/minus BMD to generate a risk of fracture over a defined \nperiod. Of these, FRAX is the most widely used, validated, \nand best established worldwide.\nFRAX: development and characteristics\nFRAX is a computer-based algorithm that calculates the \n10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture and a \nhip fracture. It was developed in 2008 by the then World \nHealth Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre at the \nUniversity of Sheffield in the United Kingdom (UK) (http:// \nfrax. shef. ac. uk/ FRAX). Through a series of extensive meta-\nanalyses [from 12 prospective population-based studies from \nNorth America, Europe, Asia, and Australia: Rotterdam, \nEVOS/EPOS, CaMos, Rochester, Sheffield, Dubbo, EPI -\nDOS, OFELY, Kuopio, Hiroshima, and two cohorts from \nGothenburg, with a total of 60,000 men and women (75%) \nand a total follow-up of over 250,000 person years [13–18]], \nseveral risk factors for fractures were identified and incor -\nporated into the tool. One of the main aims for the tool was \nfor it to be easily accessible and simple-to-use in primary \ncare. Thus, FRAX uses seven readily available dichotomous \nclinical risk factors (inserted as yes or no into the calcula -\ntor): prior fragility fracture, parental hip fracture, smoking, \nsystemic glucocorticoid use, excess alcohol intake, rheuma-\ntoid arthritis, and other causes of secondary osteoporosis. \nOther factors included in FRAX are age, sex, and body mass \nindex (BMI). FRAX can calculate fracture probability with \nor without femoral neck BMD so accommodating situations \nwhere densitometric assessment is not available.\nThere are other well-validated assessment tools available, \nincluding the Garvan fracture calculator and QFracture. The \nlatter (https:// qfrac ture. org/) is a UK model [19, 20]. Similar \nto FRAX, it takes into account the history of smoking, alco-\nhol, previous fracture, parental history, and glucocorticoid \nuse. It asks specifically about several causes of secondary \nosteoporosis and also includes a history of falls and whether \noestrogen or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used. \nBMD is not included in this tool, and it is only applica-\nble in the UK. The Garvan tool (https:// www. garvan. org.  \nFig. 1  Comparison of 10-year probabilities of a major osteoporo-\ntic fracture (%) derived for a Caucasian woman in the US with a \nT-score of − 2.5 alone at different ages and those with a prior fracture \nalone, with no risk factors and unknown BMD or a combination of \nprior fracture and a T-score of − 2.5. From [8] by kind permission of \nRightsLink\n503Journal of Endocrinological Investigation (2024) 47:501–511 \n1 3\nau/ bone- fract ure- risk) includes sex, age, weight, number of \nfractures since age 50 (0, 1, 2, 3, or more), and falls over the \nlast 12 months.\nA big difference of FRAX from these other tools is that \nFRAX calculates the probability of fracture by also consid-\nering the competing risk of mortality. This is because some \nrisk factors (female sex, age, BMI, BMD, glucocorticoids, \nand smoking) affect both these outcomes. Based on that, the \nmodel integrates the hazard ratios of fracture and death [6]. \nThe other risk engines, QFracture and Garvan, effectively \nreport cumulative fracture incidence [21].\nThe impact of combining clinical risk factors and BMD \ncan be examined using the gradient of risk, defined as the \nhazard ratio (HR) per SD unit change in the examined vari-\nable in the direction of increased risk (e.g., for BMD this \nwould be a 1 SD decrease in BMD). The gradients of risk \nfor the use of the clinical risk factors alone, femoral neck \nBMD alone, and the combination are shown in Table 1 [21]. \nBoth the CRFs alone and BMD alone result in significant \ngradients of risk, but estimates increase when both BMD and \nCRFs are used, reflecting a statistically significant but rela-\ntively weak correlation between CRFs and BMD (r  = 0.25) \n[21]. This correlation is, however, important to acknowl-\nedge, since it results in high FRAX probability, on average, \ntending to identify patients with low BMD where BMD is \nnot included [22, 23]. FRAX has been validated using 11 \nindependent cohorts that did not participate in the model \nsynthesis. In all of the validation cohorts, the gradients of \nrisk using CRFs alone or with BMD were comparable to the \noriginal ones presented in Table 1 [24].\nTo develop a country-specific model, which is necessary \nbecause age-specific rates of fracture and death differ, data \non the number of hip fractures from national sources and \nmortality rates from United Nation sources need to be care-\nfully collected. Therefore, the model is as reliable as the data \ncollected and its validation depend on the representativeness \nof the population. The model would ideally need rates on \nboth hip fracture and MOF, but the latter are only avail-\nable in a small number of countries, so most models use \nhip fractures and calculate other rates using ratios derived \nfrom Swedish data [25]. FRAX outputs are calibrated to the \nfracture and death rates in individual country models, so that \nif all the population underwent assessment by FRAX, the \nnumber of fractures predicted in the next 10 years would be \nequal to the observed number.\nThe FRAX tool was validated in the UK in a prospective \ncohort of 454,499 women aged 40–85 years and 424,336 \nmen from 357 general practices and was found to be well \ncalibrated, as the incidences of fractures predicted by FRAX \nwere similar to those observed in the cohort. The area under \nthe receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) for FRAX \nin hip fracture prediction was 0.85 for women and 0.82 for \nmen [19]. FRAX without BMD was also evaluated in Nor -\nway; the study found a generally good level of agreement \nbetween the observed number of hip fractures and the pre-\ndicted ones [AUC was 0.81, 95% confidence intervals (CI) \n0.78–0.83 for women and 0.79 (0.76–0.83) for men] [26]. \nSimilar numbers for hip fractures were observed in studies \nfrom Israel [27, 28] and Canada [29].\nThe use of FRAX for the treatment of patients \nat increased risk of fractures\nFRAX and the use of thresholds\nThe importance of FRAX is reflected by its inclusion in \nmany international guidelines [30]. There are more than 150 \nguidelines published and FRAX is the tool used in more than \nhalf of them [31]. However, the way this tool is used for \ndeciding whether to treat a patient or not varies among coun-\ntries. In general, there are two main approaches. Thus, many \nguidelines use fixed probability thresholds as intervention \nTable 1  Different scenarios of \ngradients of risk per standard \ndeviation change (95% \nconfidence intervals) in risk \nscore.

Such probability thresholds \nvary from 4 to 20% for a major osteoporotic fracture and \n1.3–5% for hip fracture, and in some cases, a 20% threshold \nappears to have been used principally on the basis that it \nis the threshold chosen in USA, rather than being appro-\npriate for the background population fracture probability \nof that country [30]. The second approach is to use age-\ndependent thresholds, as espoused by European guidance \nfrom the International Osteoporosis Foundation and Euro-\npean Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteo-\nporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases [32], \nand incorporated in other country-specific recommendations \n[30, 33]. Finally, there are countries that used hybrid thresh-\nolds, i.e., a combination of age-dependent thresholds and \nfixed thresholds. Countries following this approach include \nthe UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group guideline \n(NOGG), the Lebanon osteoporosis guideline, and the Chil-\nean guideline [34].\nThe USA guidelines have affected other countries [30]. \nThe National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) [now known \nas Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF)] \nguidelines recommend initiation of treatment in patients \nwith hip or vertebral fractures, patients whose T-score is \nin the osteoporotic range at the femoral neck, total hip or \nlumbar spine as assessed by DXA, and in postmenopausal \nwomen and men older than 50 years with osteopaenia and \na 10-year major osteoporosis fracture probability assessed \nby the appropriate FRAX tool of ≥ 20% or a hip fracture \nprobability ≥ 3% [35]. The development of these thresholds \nwas based on an economic analysis [36]. As mentioned \nabove, other countries have implemented this threshold \nwithout undertaking a similar analysis [30]. In other cases, \nfor example China and Japan, thresholds have been adapted \nto (usually lower) mean fracture incidence in the population \n[37, 38].\nAge-dependent thresholds, as espoused by the European \nguidance, are incorporated in recommendations from the UK \nNational Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG), represent-\ning the first national guideline to adopt this approach shortly \nafter FRAX was introduced [39, 40]. Prior to the NOGG \nguidance, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) guidance \nrecommended the use of BMD as the basis for interven-\ntion in postmenopausal women without fracture. The notion \nthat postmenopausal women with a prior fragility fracture \nshould be considered for treatment without the need for a \nBMD measurement remains a key recommendation. Indeed, \nthe probability of future fracture at any particular age con-\nferred by a prior fracture, with average body mass index \nand no other risk factors considered, is set as the interven-\ntion threshold in the NOGG approach, as proposed through \nthe European guidance [12]. The intervention threshold for \nwomen was also applied to men, since the effectiveness and \ncost-effectiveness of interventions are generally similar to \nthat in women for equivalent risk [41]. Definition of the \nintervention threshold also informs the setting of assessment \nthresholds. The lower assessment threshold, below which \nBMD measurement was not needed, was based on the pre-\nvious RCP and European guidelines [41, 42]. An example \nincludes a menopausal woman, with normal BMI with no \nclinical risk factors. The upper threshold was chosen to \nminimise the probability that a patient characterised to be \nat high risk on the basis of CRFs alone would be reclassi-\nfied to be at low risk with additional information on BMD \n[23]. The upper assessment threshold was set at 1.2 times \nthe intervention threshold [41]. In the first version of this \napproach, a patient should first be managed by calculating \ntheir fracture probability based on age, sex, BMI, and CRFs \nand the fracture risk was categorised in three groups: high, \nlow, and intermediate (Fig. 2). The high-risk group consisted \nFig. 2  Updated algorithm for \nthe assessment of the risk of \nfractures, introducing the con-\ncept of very high-risk patients. \nBMD bone mineral density; \nCRF: clinical risk factor. From \n[45] with kind permission from \nSpringer Science and Business \nMedia\n\n505Journal of Endocrinological Investigation (2024) 47:501–511 \n1 3\nof patients in whom treatment could be initiated without the \nneed for a BMD scan, e.g., a prior fragility fracture. The \nintermediate group should be then assessed further by BMD \nto decide on the need for treatment. The RCP and original \nNOGG guidelines were compared, and it was found that \nthe latter used DXA resources more efficiently. At the age \nof 50 years, the NOGG guidance required only 3.5 scans to \nidentify one hip fracture, versus the RCP which required \n13.9. The respective numbers at age 75 years were 0.9 and \n1.5 [43].\nFurther developments have followed the initial imple-\nmentation of age-dependent thresholds. For example, in the \nUK, the threshold was flattened from the age of 70 years \nand upwards. This was done due to the fact that the previ-\nous thresholds required a higher risk of fracture, particularly \nhip fracture, for treatment to be considered in older women \nwithout a prior fracture than those qualifying on the basis \nof fracture alone [44]. In addition, in 2020, the International \nOsteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and the European Society \nfor Clinical and Economic Evaluation of Osteoporosis and \nOsteoarthritis (ESCEO) introduced the concept of ‘very high \nrisk’ patients (Fig. 2). Examples of the latter include patients \nwith recent fractures, particularly of the spine or hip, or a \ncombination of multiple risk factors, i.e., age > 70y, prior \nfracture, and family history of hip fracture (Fig. 2). In these \ncases, osteoanabolic treatment should be considered [32, 45]\nBaseline fracture risk and treatment efficacy\nOne important issue to consider is whether the baseline \nfracture risk defines the treatment efficacy. To respond to \nthis question, a series of post hoc analyses of clinical tri-\nals of anti-osteoporosis medications have been performed. \nFrom some medications, there was no interaction between \ntreatment and baseline fracture risk, meaning that treatment \nis effective irrespective of the baseline FRAX probabil -\nity. These studies included medications like abaloparatide \n[Abaloparatide Comparator Trial in Vertebral Endpoints \n(ACTIVE) study [46]], raloxifene [Multiple Outcomes of \nRaloxifene Evaluation (MORE) [47]], teriparatide [[48]; \nTeriparatide Once-Weekly Efficacy Research (TOWER) \n[49]], alendronate [Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) [50]], \nhormone replacement treatment [51], and strontium rane-\nlate [Spinal Osteoporosis Therapeutic Intervention (SOTI) \nand Treatment of Peripheral Osteoporosis (TROPOS) [52]]. \nMedications which showed greater efficacy with higher \nbaseline risk included the oral bisphosphonate, clodronate \n[53], studied in a population sample of older women; there \nwas a significant interaction between baseline FRAX with-\nout BMD and treatment efficacy on osteoporotic fractures, \np = 0.043, with a weakening of this interaction when FRAX \nincluded BMD (p  = 0.10). In this analysis, there was also \na significant interaction of treatment with clodronate and \nBMI, which could be the major driver of the interaction with \nFRAX [53]. Denosumab [Fracture Reduction Evaluation of \nDenosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM)], \nshowed no significant interaction between treatment effect \nand baseline FRAX probability (p = 0.72); however, a cubic \nspline function was found to give a significantly (p < 0.001) \nbetter fit with a greater effect at higher probabilities [54]. \nBazedoxifene showed no overall interaction between treat-\nment and FRAX with BMD (p > 0.30), but when the 10-year \nprobability of major osteoporotic fracture is greater than \n16% (80th percentile), the treatment was associated with a \nsignificant decrease in the risk of all clinical fractures [55]. \nFinally, significant interactions were observed between \nromosozumab and baseline FRAX for clinical fractures, \nosteoporotic fractures, and MOF (p = 0.064–0.084), but not \nvertebral fractures (p > 0.30) [FRActure study in postmeno-\npausal women with ostEoporosis (FRAME)] [56]. These \nobservations are of significance when thinking about the \ncost-effectiveness of treatment. These results have a num-\nber of important implications, principally demonstrating the \nvalidity of selecting patients for treatment on the basis of \nfracture probability, potentially improved cost-effectiveness, \nand the inappropriateness of purely BMD-based thresholds \n[57]. Importantly, if BMD is not available, high fracture \npatients as characterised by CRFs and FRAX are likely to \nrespond to treatment. Targeting some medications for high-\nrisk fracture patients would be cost-effective if greater effi-\ncacy is assumed from such analyses [58].\nGlobal usage of FRAX\nThe importance of FRAX in the management of osteopo-\nrosis is reflected by its global usage. FRAX is available in \n86 models for 78 countries [(https:// frax. shef. ac. uk/ FRAX/), \naccessed February 2023]. Over the period ranging from 15 \nFebruary 2010 to 31 December 2018 inclusive, there were \naround 4.3 million sessions in the USA, followed by 1.3 mil-\nlion in the UK and 0.3 million in Canada [59]. In February \nto April 2020 inclusive, the website recorded 460,495 ses-\nsions from 184 countries, with the majority (29.2%) coming \nfrom USA [60]. Its usage by country model is available on \nthe website; however, this is an underestimation, because \nthere are other portals available to access FRAX, including \nBMD equipment, smartphone applications, and some health-\ncare electronic record systems. The COVID-19 pandemic \nnegatively affected access to FRAX (average reduction 58%, \nwith two-thirds of the countries having at least 50% reduc-\ntion) [60].\nThe use of FRAX for population screening\nAlthough guidelines in USA and Canada suggest routine \nDXA assessment in older women, in practice, this tends to \n506 Journal of Endocrinological Investigation (2024) 47:501–511\n1 3\nbe prompted by the discovery of clinical risk factors rather \nthan a systematic approach to screening. Indeed, the Euro-\npean approach has recommended intervention assessment \nand intervention on the basis of case finding. However, \nrecent trials of screening and associated health economic \nanalyses have generated an increasingly convincing evidence \nbase, on which to develop approaches to systematic screen-\ning for high fracture risk at the population level. The position \npaper, led by the Epidemiology and Quality of Life Work -\ning Group of the International Osteoporosis Foundation has \nrecently considered the recommendations for the adoption \nof national screening programmes [61]. In the UK, screen-\ning for high fracture risk is a key recommendation of the \nRoyal Osteoporosis Society All Party Parliamentary Group \nin Osteoporosis report into primary prevention (chrome-\nextension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:// strwe \nbprdm edia. blob. core. windo ws. net/ media/ vxuho tlh/ appg- on- \nosteo poros is- and- bone- health- inqui ry- report- into- prima ry- \ncare- 2022. pdf, Accessed March 2023).\nThe first study to address population-based screening \nwas undertaken in the UK. The screening for prevention \nof fractures in older women (SCOOP) trial was designed \nto evaluate whether a community screening programme \nbased on FRAX hip fracture probability could reduce the \nincidence of fractures in older women (70–85 years) over \na period of 5 years. This was a pragmatic, unblinded, two-\narm, parallel, randomised-controlled trial which recruited \nwomen from 100 general practitioner (GP) practices from \naround Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Shef-\nfield, Southampton, and York. Women known to be on \ntreatment for osteoporosis (other than calcium and vitamin \nD) were excluded. Other diseases or factors which could \nmake participants unsuitable for the study were taken into \naccount and patients were excluded on the basis of these \n(advanced malignancy, dementia, and recent bereavement) \n[62]. Women were randomised either to the screening arm \n(n = 6233) or to the usual care arm (n = 6250) which included \nopportunistic case finding. In the screening arm, FRAX \nprobabilities were calculated and the 10-year probabilities \nfor a hip fracture were compared with assessment thresholds \n[63], to determine whether a BMD measurement was needed \n(n = 3064, 49%). FRAX hip fracture probability calculated \nwith BMD was then used to separate patients into high and \nlow fracture risk groups. High-risk patients (n  = 898, 14%) \nwere invited to discuss treatment options with their general \npractitioner. By the end of year one, 953 subjects (15%) in \nthe screening arm were given a prescription for an anti-oste-\noporosis medication. The respective number for the control \narm was 264 (4%). There was a steady increase of use of \nmedications in the control arm with time. While the study \nconcluded that screening did not reduce the incidence of \nall osteoporosis-related fractures [hazard ratio (HR) 0.94, \n95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.85–1.03, p = 0.178], nor the \noverall incidence of all clinical fractures (0.94, 0.86–1.03, \np = 0.183), the approach led to a 28% relative reduction in \nhip fractures (prespecified secondary outcome) compared \nwith usual care (2.6% vs 3.5%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59–0.89, \np = 0.002) [64]. This effect on hip fracture was found to \nincrease significantly with increasing 10-year hip prob -\nability at baseline [65], consistent with the treatment effect \nbeing mediated through prescription of anti-osteoporosis \nmedications in such women. Women in the screening group \nshowed greater adherence with medication [66]. Screening \nwas found to be cost-effective [67, 68].\nAround the same time, the SCOOP trial, the Risk-strat -\nified Osteoporosis Strategy Evaluation (ROSE) study fol-\nlowed a similar approach in women aged 65–80 years in \nDenmark. Participants were randomised to either screening \nor control. The difference with SCOOP is that DXA in the \nscreening group, was only performed if the 10-year prob-\nability of major osteoporotic fracture was over or equal to \n15% and then only those who had osteoporosis as defined \nby the T-score were offered treatment [69]. As a result, the \nstudy failed to show a benefit on the fracture incidence after \n5 years of follow-up. However, the screening strategy was \nfound to be beneficial in women with moderate or high \nrisk in the per-protocol analysis (post hoc analysis). In this \nanalysis, women in the screening group who had an FRAX \nscore ≥ 15% and were scanned, were compared to women in \nthe control group who had a FRAX score ≥ 15% but were not \nscanned. The women in the first group had fewer incident \nfractures and the risk reduction with a greater effect on hip \nfractures (adjusted sub-hazard ratio 0.741, p = 0.007) [70].\nFinally, the SALT Osteoporosis Study (SOS) in the Neth-\nerlands assessed women aged 65–90 years having at least \none CRF (unlike the SCOOP and ROSE studies which ran-\ndomised everyone). One of the problems with this study is \nthat the UK FRAX model was used. Treatment was given \nto women who were found to have high probabilities, but \nonly in combination with a T-score ≤ − 2.0 or a preva-\nlent vertebral fracture. The study failed to show an effect \non fracture incidence. A post hoc analysis suggested that \nscreening might be most effective after a recent fracture \n(HR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.44–0.96 for MOF and HR = 0.38; 95% \nCI 0.18–0.79 for hip fractures) [71].\nA subsequent meta-analysis of all three studies showed \nthat population screening could be effective in reducing \nmajor osteoporotic and hip fractures. For MOF, the HR was \n0.91, 95% CI = 0.84–0.98, while for hip fractures, HR = 0.80; \n95% CI = 0.71–0.91, i.e., a 9 and 20% reduction, respectively \n[72].\nLimitations of FRAX and available adjustments\nOver the years, FRAX has been criticised for a number of \nissues, particularly that it is restricted in the number and \n507Journal of Endocrinological Investigation (2024) 47:501–511 \n1 3\ngranularity of risk factors. As mentioned above, FRAX was \ndesigned to be a simple tool, accessible, and easy to use in \nprimary care. Therefore, only a yes or no answer is accom-\nmodated in most questions in the tool. This means that risk \nfactors which are number- or dose-dependent are not fully \ncaptured. Examples include the number of prior fractures, \nthe consumption of alcohol and the dose of glucocorticoids. \nOther concerns include the lack of provision for lumbar \nspine BMD and the absence of measurements of the mate-\nrial or structural properties of bone. Finally, the age of the \nparental fracture might be of interest.\nOver time, a number of studies have proposed arithme-\ntic adjustments to the conventional FRAX probabilities, to \naddress some of these limitations. To address the issue of \nglucocorticoids, the guidance shown at Table  2 was pro-\nposed [73]. Recently, in the absence of a direct question \nrelated to falls history in FRAX and suggested potential \nadjustments [74], an analysis has provided probability ratios \nor multipliers that can be applied according to the number \nof falls over the last year [75, 76].\nProbability ratios have also been provided according to \nthe recency of fractures. For example, for a woman at age \n50 years, a recent (0–2 years) vertebral fracture is associ-\nated with a 1.92-fold higher probability than for a woman \nof the same age who had a prior fracture at any time [77]. \nMultipliers have also been provided according to the num-\nber of fractures [75]. In the last scenario, a simple solution \nwould be to lower the FRAX-based fracture probability by \n5% (i.e., 0.95 × FRAX probability) in the presence of a sin-\ngle prior fracture and to elevate the probabilities by 10, 20, \nand 30% with a history of 2, 3, and 4 or more prior fractures, \nrespectively.\nWhen BMD at the lumbar spine (LS) is available, and \nthere is discordance between this result and that at the fem-\noral neck (FN), the following rule has been proposed: to \nincrease/decrease FRAX estimate for a major fracture by \none-tenth for each rounded T-score difference between LS \nand FN (10% per SD) [78]. A further study showed that \nadjustments for large LS/FN discrepancies (> 2SD) only \nimpact to a large extent a relatively small number of peo-\nple, whereas moderate (1–2 SD) discrepancies only have a \nsmall impact [79]. Trabecular bone score (TBS) and hip axis \nlength are sometimes available, and adjustments of fracture \nprobabilities have been provided [80, 81].\nA few adjustments have been proposed in cases with type \n2 diabetes mellitus, including adjustment with TBS or use of \nthe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) input [82]. A similar approach \n(using the RA output) has been proposed for Parkinson’s dis-\nease [83]. Place of origin can also affect FRAX probabilities, \nas shown in a study in Sweden [84], where the hip fracture \nincidence for Swedish-born people was approximately dou-\nble when compared to the one of people born outside the \ncountry. Moreover, there was an increase in the hip fracture \nincidence with time from immigration (0.6% per year). It \nwas suggested that the country of birth should be used when \nusing FRAX [84].\nThere are variables not incorporated into FRAX, but stud-\nies have shown that the fracture probabilities would remain \nunaffected if these were taken into account. In Canada, \nFRAX resulted in a robust prediction of fractures regardless \nof socioeconomic status, given that the competing risk of \nmortality is taken into account [85]. Moreover, FRAX with \nand without BMD was found to be unaffected by current or \nprevious osteoporosis treatment [86] and body composition \n[87].\nAlthough these adjustments can be undertaken by the user \nto modify the fracture probability output by FRAX, a further \nwebsite, FRAXplus, will allow the user to incorporate such \neffect modifiers automatically.\nDevelopment of the core FRAX tool\nFRAX has been designed as a living tool, hence the adap-\ntation to more countries and territory models, languages, \nTable 2  Adjustments \n(percentage) of the FRAX \naccording to dose of \nglucocorticoids.

This update of \nFRAX will be informed by analysis of 64 cohorts, includ-\ning more than 2 million individuals, 69% of them being \nwomen [88]. It includes data on 41,015 hip fractures and \n113,641 MOF. The expanded numbers will enable more \naccurate model development and consideration of other \nrisk factors, for example falls and type II diabetes in the \nrisk engine itself.\nConclusion\nFRAX is the globally leading tool for assessment of frac-\nture risk, incorporated into over 100 guidelines interna-\ntionally. In addition to informing treatment decisions, it \ncan also be used to guide assessment with BMD most \nefficiently. The cost-effectiveness of such approaches has \nbeen demonstrated, as has the potential utility of FRAX \nas the core of approaches to population screening for high \nfracture risk. The new FRAXplus website will permit \nmodification of FRAX probability to account for a range \nof additional clinical considerations and the second ver -\nsion of the core FRAX risk engine is under development.\nDeclarations \nConflict of interest MS: no conflicts of interest in relation to this study. \nHJ: no conflicts of interest in relation to this study.
