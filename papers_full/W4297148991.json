  "abstract": "Background: Although communication tools might guide healthcare professionals in communicating with children about cancer, it is unclear what kind of tools are used. This scoping review aimed to map the communication tools used in cancer communication among children with cancer, families, and healthcare professionals. Methods: A comprehensive search using PubMed (including MEDLINE), Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was conducted on 1 August 2021. We mapped communication tools and their impacts. Results: We included 25 studies (9 experimental studies and 16 feasibility studies) of 29 reports and found 21 communication tools. There was a lack of communication tools that were (1) accessible and validated, (2) designed for healthcare professionals, (3) targeted children, families, and healthcare professionals, and (4) were designed to meet the needs of children and families. Experimental studies showed that the communication tools improved children’s knowledge and psychological outcomes (e.g., health locus of control, quality of life, self-efficacy). Conclusion: We mapped communication tools and identified areas that needed further research, including a lack of tools to guide healthcare professionals and share information with children and families. Further research is needed to develop and evaluate these communication tools. Moreover, it is necessary to investigate how communication tools support children, families, and healthcare professionals.",
