    "abstract": "Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) stand on the brink of reshaping the field of aging and dementia care, challenging the one-size-fits-all paradigm with their capacity for precision medicine and individualized treatment strategies. The “Large Pre-Trained Models with a Focus on AD/ADRD and Healthy Aging” symposium, organized by the National Institute on Aging and the Johns Hopkins Artificial Intelligence &amp; Technology Collaboratory for Aging Research, served as a platform for exploring this potential. The symposium brought together diverse experts to discuss the integration of LLMs in aging and dementia care. They highlighted the roles LLMs can play in clinical decision support and predictive analytics, while also addressing critical ethical concerns including bias, privacy, and the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI). The discussions focused on the need to balance technological advancement with ethical considerations in AI deployment. In conclusion, the symposium projected a future where LLMs not only revolutionize healthcare practices but also pose significant challenges that require careful navigation.",
