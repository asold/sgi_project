In this study, we examined the influence of various ecological\nfactors on live sponge distribution and the occurrence of sponging in parts of the western gulf of\nShark Bay. We assessed sponge distribution and seagrass cover along 12 transects of approxi-\nmately 11 km length, by recording sponges and seagrass in a total of 1380 quadrats (1 × 1 m), of\nwhich 56 quadrats contained conical sponges. The occurrence of sponging dolphins (‘spongers’)\nwas documented along 10 of these 12 transects. The distribution of conical sponges was nega-\ntively correlated with the distribution of seagrass: no conical sponges were observed in water\ndepths of <10 m and no seagrasses were found at depths of >12 m. A digital elevation model, cre-\nated from the sample depth data, identified channels in the region. Binary logistic and Poisson log-\nlinear generalised linear models showed that water depth and bathymetric features including\nchannel, substrate and slope were significant in predicting the occurrence and the mean number\nof conical sponges, as well as that of seagrass. Conical sponge distribution was positively corre-\nlated with the distribution of sponging, indicating that ecological factors influence where spong-\ning occurs. The greater number of spongers found in this region may be explained by the larger\narea of habitat suitable for conical sponges in the western than the eastern gulf of Shark Bay.\nKEY WORDS:  Dolphin behaviour · Social transmission · Digital elevation model · Bathymetry ·\nShark Bay · Western Australia\nResale or republication not permitted without written consent of the publisher\nMar Ecol Prog Ser 444: 143–153, 2012144\nmarine mammals (Krützen et al. 2005, Sargeant et al.\n2007). Unfortunately, disentangling the ecological\nand behavioural components leading to such pat-\nterns is difficult when a particular behaviour cannot\nbe linked directly to a causal ecological factor. Such\nlinks however, could be drawn where the foraging\nbehaviour under investigation involves tool use, as\nthe availability of tools should be highly correlated\nwith the occurrence of the behaviour involving the\ntools.\nTool use, although rare in the animal kingdom, oc-\ncurs in a wide range of taxa, including insects, fish,\nbirds and mammals (St Amant & Horton 2008). While\nin some taxa the ontogeny of tool use appears to be\ntriggered through inherent characteristics (e.g. birds;\nKenward et al. 2005), social learning has been in-\nvoked in many others (e.g. chimpanzees; Nishida\n1973) and is thought to be indicative of advanced\ncognitive abilities (Rendell & Whitehead 2001). In-\nvoking social learning as the sole explanation for\nvariation in foraging behaviour within and between\nanimal populations has been carried out by discount-\ning ecological and genetic factors (e.g. McGrew et al.\n1997, Whiten et al. 1999, Laland & Hoppitt 2003, Van\nSchaik et al. 2003). However, the variation in some\nforaging behaviours has been found to be at least\npartly predicted by ecological factors, such as prey\nbehaviour and characteristics, such as variation in\nant-dipping behaviour in chimpanzees, which is\npartly ex plained by the aggressiveness of the ants\n(Humle & Matsu zawa 2002). Thus, a quantitative ap-\nproach attempting to correlate ecological factors with\nthe occurrence of a behaviour is an important compo-\nnent of enhancing our understanding of how envi-\nronment shapes behavioural heterogeneity in marine\nmammal populations. For instance, environmental\nfactors, such as a predictable tidally influenced\nisland wake, have been linked with foraging tactics\nin wild cetacean populations, such as fin whales Bal-\naenoptera physalus and minke whales B. acutoros-\ntrata (Johnston et al. 2005), as well as bottlenose dol-\nphins Tursiops truncatus (Hastie et al. 2004).\nA long-term study of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops\nsp. in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, Western Aus-\ntralia, revealed a diverse array of foraging tactics\nwithin this population (Mann & Sargeant 2003). One\nof these tactics involved the use of sponges as forag-\ning tools. Dolphins carry conical sponges Echinodic-\ntyum mesenterinum on their rostra, a behaviour\ntermed ‘sponging’ (Smolker et al. 1997). Sponges are\nthought to serve as a protective tool while the dol-\nphins are foraging for prey in the substratum\n(Smolker et al. 1997). Several studies have shown\nthat sponging is a foraging tactic exhibited by a\nminority of individuals within the population (e.g.\nMann & Sargeant 2003), presumably to target prey\nwithout swim bladders (Patterson & Mann 2011).\nComparing fatty acid signatures, a long-term indica-\ntor of assimilated diet in animals (Iverson et al. 2004),\nfrom sponging dolphins (hereafter ‘spongers’) and\nnon-spongers suggested that sponging enables dol-\nphins to obtain prey that might otherwise not be\naccessible to them (Kreicker 2010. This further cor-\nroborates the notion that sponging is related to forag-\ning and, indeed, might allow differential niche\nexploitation by dolphins with different foraging tac-\ntics (Krei cker 2010).\nSponging by bottlenose dolphins in eastern Shark\nBay provided the first evidence of a material culture\nin cetaceans, with vertical knowledge transfer from\nmother to offspring (Krützen et al. 2005), a pattern\nalso found in the western gulf of Shark Bay (Acker-\nmann 2008). However, those studies focussed on the\npotential cultural transmission of sponging behaviour\nand did not investigate any ecological factors which\nmight affect it. In a different study, Sargeant et al.\n(2007) found a correlation between sponging behav-\niour and sponge occurrence in the eastern gulf,\nemphasising the potential influence of ecological\nvariables on the occurrence of tool-use by bottle -\nnose dolphins. The distribution and morphology of\nsponges are influenced by a variety of factors such as\nwater flow and depth (Bell & Barnes 2001), slope gra-\ndient (Bell & Barnes 2000a,b), substratum type and\nrates of sedi mentation (Bell & Barnes 2000c, Fromont\net al. 2006). Factors influencing the distribution of\nsponges may well affect the distribution of spongers\nin Shark Bay (Sargeant et al. 2007).\nIn this study we investigated the relationship be-\ntween ecological variables that influence sponge dis-\ntribution and the distribution of spongers and non-\nspongers in the western gulf of Shark Bay. Our\napproach expands on that taken by Sargeant et al.\n(2007) and applies it to a new study site. We used in-\nformation on habitat depths from ~1400 quadrats to\ncreate a digital elevation model (DEM). This detailed\ndepth data allowed us to identify channel areas and\naspects of bathymetry, such as depth and slope of the\nbottom, which provide an indication of water flow. In\nparticular, we investigated whether the distribution of\nconical sponges in the western gulf of Shark Bay is af-\nfected by physical characteristics of the environment,\nsuch as depth, the presence and slope of channels (to\ninfer water flow) and the characteristics of the benthic\nsubstratum and habitats. We also examined patterns\nof conical sponge distribution to determine whether\nTyne et al.: Sponge distribution and Tursiops tool use\nthey explain some of the variation in the  dis tribution\nof sponging behaviour in bottlenose  dolphins.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy site\nShark Bay, situated approximately 850 km north of\nPerth on the west coast of Australia, is a semi-\nenclosed bay (Fig. 1). This system comprises 2 large\nshallow embayments (the eastern and western gulfs),\ndivided by the Peron Peninsula, as well as numerous\nislands, and a coastline stretching over 1500 km. The\nShark Bay marine environment is relatively shallow\nthroughout and consists of shallow sand flats, embay-\nment plains, and deeper channels (Nahas et al. 2003).\nTwelve species of seagrass are found in Shark Bay,\nforming extensive seagrass meadows in the shal-\nlower waters, dominated (up to 85% cover) by one\nspecies, Amphibolus antarctica (Walker et al. 1988).\nData collection\nBenthic sampling\nA rapid, non-destructive and cost-effective remote\nvideo and data management system was developed\nto record data on benthic habitats in Shark Bay (Tyne\net al. 2010). From 21 April to 25 May 2008 we navi-\ngated 12 predetermined 11 km long transects (T1 to\nT12; Fig. 1) across depth contours in the Denham\nChannel/Freycinet Reach, using a 5.5 m boat with a\n100 hp outboard. North−south columns of 5 sample\npoints, each 150 m apart, were selected every 500 m\nalong these transects, consisting of 23 sampled loca-\ntions and 115 sample points per transect (Fig. 1).\nSampling was undertaken when sea conditions were\nfavourable, i.e. at Beaufort Sea State of 3 or less.\nAt each sample position, the camera and 1 m\n2\nframe quadrat were lowered to the seabed and a\nshort video of the substrate was captured on the con-\nnected laptop (Tyne et al. 2010). Date, time, depth,\n145\nFig. 1. Transect lines with sample points (115 per transect) where benthic habitats were sampled using a video system to deter-\nmine the distribution of conical sponges Echinodictyum mesenterinum in the western gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia\nMar Ecol Prog Ser 444: 143–153, 2012\ntemperature, and latitude and longitude were re cor -\nded. At the end of each sampling day, a data mana -\nge ment system was used to analyse the videos (Tyne\net al. 2010). The following data were recorded from\neach video capture of a quadrat: presence/absence of\nconical sponges, number of conical spon ges, pres-\nence/absence of seagrass, percentage cover of sea-\ngrass and type of substratum. The substratum was\ncategorised qualitatively from each video into one of\n3 broad categories: hard, coarse grain or sand.\nDolphin surveys\nBoat based photographic identification and behav-\nioural surveys on dolphin groups (Mann 1999) were\nconducted in each austral winter between 2007 and\n2009. Dolphin groups were surveyed along 10 tran-\nsects (T3 to T12) over the 3 winters. In 2007 and 2008,\neach transect was conducted 5 times during the sea-\nson, while in 2009, a total of 10 runs were completed\non each transect due to a longer field season. Dol-\nphins were ap proached when observed within 300 m\nof the transect. During the first 5 min of an encounter,\nthe predominant dolphin group behaviour (i.e. the\nactivity state of ≥50% of the group members) was\ncatego rised into 5 mutually exclusive categories (for-\nage, rest, socialise, travel, or unknown), together\nwith in formation on whether or not dolphin(s) were\nwearing a sponge. We also recorded the GPS location\nof the encounter and water depth. In addition, dol-\nphins in the group were photographed for later iden-\ntification. When all the dolphins were photographed,\nand the encounter complete, the transect survey was\ncontinued. Dolphins were assumed to be foraging if\nthey were observed performing steep tail out dives or\npeduncle dives in deep water that last for 1 to 2 min,\nand if they were also observed wearing a conical\nsponge during this behavioural state at least once\nduring the 3 field seasons, they were categorised as\nspongers. This differs slightly from the classification\nof spongers in the eastern gulf by Mann et al. (2008),\nwho classified individuals as spongers based on >1\nobservation of an individual with a sponge.\nData analysis\nA DEM was interpolated from the depth recordings\nfor each benthic survey sample point to produce an\ninterpretation of the bathymetry of the study site\nusing the IDRISI GIS software. The depth recordings\nwere adjusted for tide height. Channels were classi-\nfied as areas of the study site where the water depth\nwas ≥10 m and the proportion of these deeper waters\nwas calculated from the DEM for the study site.\nBecause we did not have in situ current measure-\nments, we inferred water flow from the slope of each\nchannel. For example, a fixed volume of water pass-\ning through a channel consisting of a steep slope and\na narrow width would imply a greater water flow\nvelocity than that of a channel consisting of a more\ngradual slope and a greater width. The average slope\nfor the eastern and western sides of each sample\npoint were determined by calculating 2 coordinates,\n200 and 400 m east and west from each sample point.\nUsing the observed depth at the sample point (D\npoint)\nand the modelled depths from the DEM at the 2 cal-\nculated coordinates, 200 m (D\n200m) and 400 m (D400m),\nthe difference in depths at the 200 and 400 m coordi-\nnates to that of the sample point was determined,\nS\n200m= D point − D 200m and S 400m= D point − D 400m. The\naverage slope to the eastern and western 400 m point\nwas calculated (= [S\n400m − S 200m]/2), where S 400m =\nslope to 400 m from the sample point and S 200m =\nslope to 200 m from the sample point.\nThe spatial distributions of sponges and seagrass\nwere examined using IDRISI 15.01 Andes Edition\nGIS software (linked to the data management sys-\ntem) with the appropriate Seafarer nautical chart\n(AUS749). Point vector files indicating the pres-\nence/absence and number of conical sponges, as\nwell as the presence/ absence and percentage cover\nof seagrass were created for each sampling point to\nproduce spatial distribution maps for sponges and\nseagrass.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were undertaken using R 2.10.1\n(R Development Core Team 2010) and SPSS v16.0.2.\nData were accessed directly from the data manage-\nment system ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)\nand summary tables and charts were produced.\nBinary logistic and Poisson log-linear generalised lin-\near models (GLMs) were developed to investigate\nwhether the presence/absence and counts of conical\nsponges, as well as the presence/absence and per-\ncentage cover of seagrass, were significantly related\nto the presence and position of channels, slope of the\nbottom, substrate, and water depth.\nThe relationship between presence and absence of\nconical sponges or seagrass with the predictor vari-\nables was explored using a binary logistic GLM with\na link function. The relationship between the number\n146\nTyne et al.: Sponge distribution and Tursiops tool use\nof conical sponges or percentage sea-\ngrass cover and the predictor vari-\nables was explored using a log- linear\nPoisson GLM with a log-link function,\nwhere log(µ) is the log of the mean of\nthe dependent variable. Models with\nonly 1 predictor were created at first.\nThe models with significant predictors\nwere then combined to create multiple\npredictor models. Akaike’s informa-\ntion criterion (AIC) (Akaike 1974),\nwhich selects the most parsimonious\nmodel that best fit the data by taking\ninto account the variation explained\nand the number of terms in the model,\nwas used to select the best model. The\nlower the AIC value, the better the\nmodel (Burnham & Anderson 2002).\nThe locations of spongers recorded\nfrom the 2007 to 2009 surveys were\noverlaid on the DEM and chart of the\nstudy area, indicating which of the 5\nchannels the dolphins were using\n(North West, North East, Central,\nSouth West and South East; see Fig. 2).\nAll surveys with a sighting of at least 1\nsponger were used in the analyses of\ndolphin distribution and environmen-\ntal variables. No re-sightings, defined\nas an encounter of a group with the\nsame composition of a group in an ear-\nlier survey on the same day, were\nincluded in analyses. A binary logistic\nGLM was developed to test whether\nwater depth and channel were significant in predict-\ning the probability of the occurrence of spongers.\nRESULTS\nBathymetry, sponges and seagrass\nA total of 1380 videos were recorded over an area\nspanning approximately 248 km\n2. The DEM of the\nstudy area revealed 5 deep channels (≥10 m in depth)\nin the western gulf study area (Fig. 2). The North\nWest channel (C1) had the deepest mean depth\n(13.2 m) and the largest number of quadrats with\nconical sponges (24); while the North East channel\n(C2) had the shallowest mean depth (11.8 m) and a\nlow number of quadrats with conical sponges (3)\n(Fig. 2). The Central channel (C3) was the widest and\ncovered the largest area. Depths of between 15 and\n16 m were found predominantly in the western areas\nof the study site from T1 to T6; although T10, T11 and\nT12 also had small areas where the water depth\nreached 15 m (Fig. 2).\nConical sponges were found in 56 (4%) of the 1380\nsamples. The percentage of quadrats containing con-\nical sponges ranged from 0% (T11 and T12) to 14%\n(T3) and the mean number of conical sponges per\nquadrat ranged from 0 (T11 and T12) to 0.20 (T3).\nThe mean depth for the presence of conical\nsponges was 13.5 m (range 10.1 to 15.7 m). In con-\ntrast to conical sponges, seagrass was found only in\ndepths ≤11.8 m. The mean depth of quadrats contain-\ning seagrass was 7.5 m and the main species was\nAmphibolus antarctica.\nThe probability of the occurrence of conical sponges\nin a quadrat in relationship to depth was estimated to\nbe 0 until a depth of ca. 6 m, increasing slowly to 0.1 at\nca. 14 m before reaching a maximum of 0.18 at 16 m\n147\nFig. 2.

The predicted probability of seagrass occur-\nrence with depth showed the opposite pattern — the\npredicted probability of the occurrence of seagrass in\na quadrat was 1 until a depth of 6 m, 0.8 at 9 m and 0 at\n12 m (Fig. 3B). Depth was a sig nificant predictor in the\nbinary logistic GLMs for predicting the occurrence of\nconical sponges (positive slope), and in predicting the\noccurrence of seagrass (negative slope) (Table 1). The\nmost parsimonious model for predicting the occur-\nrence of seagrass, as indicated by the lowest AIC\nvalue, was the model with depth fitted as the only pre-\ndictor (Table 1). Depth, substrate and channel were\nall significant predictors for the occurrence of conical\nsponges in the binary logistic GLMs, however, the\nAIC values indicated that the model based on the pre-\ndictors, substrate and channel, was a better fit to the\ndata (Table 1).\nThe number of conical sponges increased with\nincreasing depth (Fig. 4). The shape of the curve for\nthe predicted mean number of conical sponges with\nincreasing depth (Fig. 4B) was similar to that of the\npredicted occurrence of conical sponges (Fig. 3A). In\ncontrast, the predicted mean percentage cover of\nseagrass decreased with depth; it was approximately\n45% at around 1 m depth and decreased fairly\nrapidly to 10% at about 5 m depth, before it declined\nmore gradually to about 0.04% at around 16 m\n(Fig. 4D). The model of best fit for predicting the\nmean number of conical sponges had 3 predictors:\nsubstrate, channel and eastern slope (Table 2). The\nmodel of best fit to predict the mean percentage\ncover of seagrass contained depth, channel and 3\ninteraction terms (Table 2).\nDistribution of dolphins in relation to sponge \noccurrence\nBetween 2007 and 2009, 471 dolphin groups\nwere photo-identified whilst on transect (Table 3).\n148\n1612840\nPredicted\nObserved\nPredicted\nObserved\n1612840\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\nDepth (m)\nPresence/absence of conical sponges and seagrasses\nA\nB\nFig. 3.

A total of 232 indi-\nvidual dolphins were identified while carrying out\ntransect surveys, and 44 of these were observed\nsponging (Table 3). The predicted probability of\noccurrence of spongers by depth was ~0.01 until a\ndepth of 3.8 m, and then increased slowly to 0.15 at\n10 m, reaching its maximum of 0.7 at ~16 m (Fig. 7).\nAll individual dolphins classified as spongers, includ-\ning 15 individuals identified while not on transect,\nwere observed predominantly in the deep water\nchannels (>10 m depth), whether or not they were\ncarrying a sponge on their rostra (Table 4).\nConical sponges were only observed in water\ndepths ≥10 m (Figs. 2 & 6), where 86 out of 88\n(97.7%) encounters with spongers were recorded.\nIn contrast, only 45% of all encounters with non-\nsponging dolphins were recorded in water depths\n≥10 m, of which 54% were apparently foraging.\nThe mean water depths of the occurrence of\nconical sponges and the occurrence of spongers\nwere similar (~14 m); whereas the mean depth at\nwhich non-sponging dolphins were sighted appar-\nently foraging was 9.8 m, about 4 m shallower than\nthat for spongers (Fig. 8). The depth range of sight-\nings of spongers (9.4 to 16 m) was narrower than\nthat for non-sponging dolphins (3.4 to 15.9 m; Fig.\n8). About 51% of our study area in the western gulf\nwas ≥10 in depth compared with only 0.26% of the\nstudy area in the eastern gulf (Sargeant et al.\n2007).\n149\nFig. 4.

The results from this study suggest that\necological factors, particularly the distribution of con-\nical sponges, have an important influence on the\noccurrence of sponging in the western gulf of Shark\nBay. Conical sponges and spongers were found pre-\ndominantly in the deeper water channels ( ≥10 m in\ndepth). Furthermore, the predicted probability of the\noccurrence of conical sponges and spongers was cor-\nrelated with increasing water depth and channel\ncharacteristics, such as depth and slope. The type of\nsubstratum was also significantly correlated with\nconical sponges and spongers. The number of\nspongers recorded during transect and non-transect\nsurveys during this 3 yr study (54) is high compared\nwith the number (41) observed during 25 yr of field\nwork in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay (Mann et al.\n2008).\n150\nModel AIC df χ2\nConical sponges\nDepth 543.64 1 45.70\nSubstrate, 396.18 2 57.36\nChannel 5 28.31\nSeagrass\nDepth 3444.44 1 1852.82\nDepth, 2960.53 1 239.41\nChannel 5 319.08\nDepth, 2944.69 1 163.15\nChannel, 5 328.72\nSlope 1 18.35\nDepth, 2637.53 1 69.35\nChannel, 5 91.01\nSlope, 1 15.77\nChannel × Depth 5 95.95\nTable 2.

Data specific to dolphins observed car-\nrying sponges (‘spongers’) identified from both transect and\nnon-transect surveys from 2007 to 2009. Channels: depth \n≥10 m; shallows; depth <10 m\nTyne et al.: Sponge distribution and Tursiops tool use\nSimilarly, in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, sponges\nand spongers were concentrated primarily in the\ndeeper waters of the channels, and sponge carrying\nwas largely limited to deep waters where sponges\nwere abundant (≥8 m; Smolker et al. 1997, Sargeant\net al. 2007). The channels in the eastern gulf, how-\never, are generally shallower (5 to 6 cm, Nahas et al.\n2005) than those in the western gulf (10 to 16 m;\nFig. 2). This suggests that water flow, rather than\ndepth alone, predicts sponge distribution and, there-\nfore, the occurrence of sponging behaviour. In gen-\neral, the distribution and growth of sponges is influ-\nenced by factors other than water depth, such as\nwater flow, sedimentation, and type and shape of\nsubstrate (Bell & Barnes 2000a,b, Fromont et al.\n2006). Although water flow was not measured in this\nstudy, sponge abundance increased in the deeper,\nnarrower channels of the western gulf (i.e. the north\nwestern and south eastern regions of the study area;\nFig. 2), where water flow may be an important con-\ntributing factor to providing suitable habitat for\nsponges. Increased water flow is also likely to\nenhance the growth of sponges (Bell & Barnes\n2000c).\nWe might expect sponging behaviour to be ex -\nplained by one or more, or a combination of, 3 factors:\nsome genetic predisposition, ecological characteris-\ntics, and social learning. Krützen et al. (2005) pre-\nsented evidence for social learning, rather than\ngenes or ecological characteristics determining\nsponging in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay. Acker-\nmann (2008) found a similar pattern in the west.\nHowever, neither of these studies examined the sig-\nnificance of environmental factors. In the eastern\ngulf, Sargeant et al. (2007) found evidence of ecolog-\nical correlates with sponging behaviour. This study\nextended the approach of Sargeant et al. (2007), and\nassessed sponge distribution in the west and the eco-\nlogical factors that seem to promote sponge presence\nand abundance. In the western gulf, we found (1)\nthat many sponges occurred in deeper water with\nsteeper eastern slopes, which is an indicator of\nhigher water flow and likely to provide conditions\nthat enhance sponge growth, (2) a large area of suit-\nable habitat for the presence and growth of sponges\nand (3) the presence of many spongers. Thus, our\ndata suggests that ecological conditions contribute to\nwhere sponging occurs in our study area in the west-\nern gulf. However, the relative contributions of eco-\nlogical characteristics vs. social learning to the distri-\nbution of sponging behaviour by dolphins is unclear.\nIn the study area of the western gulf of Shark Bay,\na total of 54 individually identified spongers were\nrecorded during 3 field seasons. In contrast, only 41\nspongers have been identified over 25 yr of research\nin the eastern gulf region (Mann et al. 2008). An indi-\nvidual in the eastern gulf, however, was only classi-\nfied as a sponger if it had been observed carrying a\nsponge on >1 occasion (Mann et al. 2008), compared\nto only once in this study. The western gulf study\narea consists of 51% deep habitat (>10 m in depth),\ncompared with just 0.26% in the eastern study area\n(Heithaus & Dill 2002). Since both gulf study areas\nare of similar sizes (eastern gulf = 286 km\n2, western\ngulf = 248 km2), it appears that the western gulf pro-\nvides a substantially greater area favourable to coni-\ncal sponges and spongers. This suggests that the\ngreater number of spongers found in the western gulf\nis further evidence of the contribution of ecological\nfactors to the distribution of sponging behaviour,\nrather than an artefact of the different definitions of\nsponger be tween gulfs.\nIn addition to the location of channels, depth and\nthe distribution of sponges, prey distribution may\nhave an important influence on the distribution of\nspongers (Sargeant et al. 2007, Mann et al. 2008, Pat-\nterson & Mann 2011). Spongers were observed\nwhere sponges were located, but no conical sponges\nfound. Thus, dolphins may transport conical sponges\nto areas where they do not grow in order to take ad -\nvantage of prey in these locations (Patterson & Mann\n2011). Patterson & Mann (2011) identified potential\nprey items of spongers in the eastern gulf of Shark\nBay. Determining the distribution of these prey items\n151\nFig. 6.

These are areas\nwhere the current flow is likely to be more fa vou -\nrable to sponges. The highest numbers of conical\nsponges were found in the north western region of\nthe study site. The abundance of sponges was also\nreported to increase in the deep channels of the east-\nern gulf of Shark Bay (Bell & Barnes 2000b). In the\nwestern gulf, the tidal magnitude increases as the\ngulf narrows (Nahas et al. 2005). Since the western\ngulf narrows to the south in comparison to the east-\nern gulf and the channels are deeper, water flow is\nexpected to be faster in some areas in the western\nthan eastern gulf. This provides a greater area of\nfavourable environments for the growth of sponges\nthan that in the eastern gulf, where sponges are\nrestricted to the few channels between sand banks.\nSponges are generally highly competitive in co -\nlonising the benthic substratum (Bell & Barnes\n2000c). However, they are often overgrown by\norganisms such as ascidians, soft corals, and some\nspecies of algae (Bell & Barnes 2000c). No sponges\nwere seen in the quadrats that contained seagrasses\nfrom the 1380 video recordings completed during\nthis study. The absence of sponges from the shal-\nlower habitats (<10 m in depth) could be explained\nby unfavourable ecological conditions for sponge\ngrowth (e.g. low water flow due to predominance of\nseagrasses), unsuitable substratum, and competition\nfor space by seagrasses in these areas.\nConclusions\nThis study has demonstrated significant relation-\nships between water depth, the presence of channels\nthat promote water flow and the occurrence of\nsponging by bottlenose dolphins. The bathymetry of\nthe study area appears to be influential in determin-\ning the distribution of sponges in the region. Ecolog-\nical factors, such as water depth and channel pres-\nence, were significant in predicting the presence of\nconical sponges, which, in turn, was significant in\npredicting the occurrence of sponging behaviour in\nthe bottlenose dolphin community. The large number\nof spongers documented in the western gulf study\narea during only 3 yr may be an indication that the\nwestern gulf study area is a more ecologically\nfavourable area for sponging behaviour than the\neastern gulf of Shark Bay. Information on substratum\ntype and slope of other deep water areas ( ≥10 m) in\nthe western gulf was unavailable for this study.\nDepth, however, was significant in predicting the\noccurrence of both conical sponges and spongers.\nFuture research efforts in the western gulf of Shark\nBay should concentrate on other deep water areas to\nassess substrate and slope (or indeed direct measures\nof water flow) and, therefore, suitability of sponge\nand sponger habitat. Including other areas for com-\nparison might better resolve the relative contribu-\ntions of the ecological and social factors driving tool\nuse in Shark Bay’s bottlenose dolphins.\nAcknowledgements.
