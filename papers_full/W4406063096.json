Introduction\nIn a rapidly evolving society, the emergence of new\nobjects poses challenges to individuals and robots, partic-\nularly in interacting with objects of unknown names. This\nis a significant hurdle for effective human-robot interaction\n(HRI), especially for the elderly or sick who rely on robot\nassistance. With an aging population and rising labor costs,\nthere is growing interest in utilizing mobile manipulators\n(Li et al., 2023b; Ren et al., 2011) or novel robot platforms\n(Gonçalves and Santos, 2023; Cao et al., 2023b; Tang et al.,\n2024) to address these challenges. A key factor for the\nsuccess of future robotics services is ensuring that Human-\nRobot Interaction (HRI) remains intuitive and adaptable to\na wide range of objects (Alonso-Martín et al., 2017; Lu\net al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2024a). However, existing HRI\nframeworks heavily rely on pre-trained detector networks\n(Esfahanietal.,2020;Guetal.,2022;Yangetal.,2024b;Xu\netal.,2024b)oroftenrequiremasteringcomplexgesturesor\nare prone to ambiguity when describing complex scenarios\n(Endeetal.,2011;Vancetal.,2023;Gamboa-Monteroetal.,\n2023), which is impractical for the elderly and even for\nordinarypeople.Therearesignificantdomaingapstobridge\nfor intuitive HRI with rare objects (Yang et al., 2022; Cao\n∗Corresponding author\nYuzhi.Lai@Reutlingen-University.DE (Y.

However, relying\non large language models (LLMs) for object perception\noften requires a supervised model and an understanding\nof semantic meaning (Esfahani et al., 2019a; Liao et al.,\n2023; Yin et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2024a; Yin et al., 2024),\nwhichposeschallengeswhenencounteringrareorunknown\nobjects. LLMs also have other problems, like hallucination\nfor untrained tasks and tedious syntax structures. Despite\nthese challenges, they serve as inspiration for new research\nefforts.\nTo address the challenge of unknown objects and im-\nprove HRI intuitiveness, we propose NVP-HRI, a zero-\nshot natural multi-modal HRI approach integratingvoice\nand posture commands via LLM (Lai et al., 2025). NVP-\nHRI makes use of the pre-trained Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) (Kirillov et al., 2023) to select areas of interest\nand enable zero-shot inference of point clouds for unknown\nobjects.

RELATED WORK\nObject detection (Wang et al., 2015) plays a crucial role\nin HRI systems, enabling robots to interact accurately with\nthe world (Li and Yuan, 2024). As the standard of living\nincreases, the requirements for object detection also need\nto increase, particularly in zero-shot rare object detection\n(Esfahani et al., 2021). Existing systems predominantly rely\non pre-trained supervised networks, such as Mask R-CNN\n(Hameed et al., 2022), YOLO (Li et al., 2023b), and SSD\n(Wang et al., 2022). The training of these networks relies\non a large number of annotated datasets such as ImageNet\n(Deng et al., 2009), Microsoft COCO (Lin et al., 2014),\nJacquard (Depierre et al., 2018; Li and Yuan, 2024) and\nMCD (Nguyen et al., 2024b). However, these supervised\nmodels have problems in dealing with rare (Cao et al.,\n2024b), unknown or new objects (Yuan and Wang, 2014).\nSomeworks(Weberetal.,2020;Großmannetal.,2014)ex-\nplored new modalities to deal with unknown objects (Zhou\netal.,2023),suchasusingaheadmountedeyetracker(We-\nber et al., 2020) or a depth camera (Großmann et al., 2014).\nSome researchers (Weber et al., 2020) have implemented a\ndistillation-based method using gaze with a head-mounted\neyetrackertodetectunknownobjects.However,thismethod\nrelies on the accuracy of the hardware as well as precise\ngazing at the target object for an extended period of time,\nwhich is inefficient. In addition, using and carrying an eye\ntracker can be a challenge for the elderly. Depth cameras\n(Ji et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2024a), as the most commonly\nused hardware devices in HRI, also have capabilities in the\ndetection of unknown objects. The fixation-based unknown\nobject segmentation approach (Großmann et al., 2014) was\nproposedbycombiningRGBimagesanddepthmaps.Using\nthe Graph Cut algorithm (Boykov and Kolmogorov, 2004)\nas an intermediate step and refining it with the Grab Cut\nalgorithm (Rother et al., 2004), this approach demonstrates\nnotable improvements in processing speed. However, de-\nspitetheseoptimizations,theprocessingtimerequiresmore\nthan two seconds per image. Our proposed NVP-HRI uses\npretrained SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023) to obtain point cloud\nand accurate representation of zero shot objects. Compared\nto HRI methods using supervised pre-trained models (Vanc\net al., 2023; Stepputtis et al., 2020; Constantin et al., 2022),\nour approach is more suitable for real-world challenges on\nobject detection brought by the increase in living standards.\nFurthermore, our method does not require users to wear\nadditional equipment (Deng et al., 2024a,b), enhancing us-\nability and efficiency.\nInrecentyears,developingefficient,intuitiveandnatural\nHRI methods has become a key research priority for future\nservice robots. Some systems rely on singular modality\ninput, such as gesture (Vanc et al., 2023), tactile (Wang\netal.,2024),surfaceelectromyography(EMG)(Zhangetal.,\n2024) and audio input (Skrzypek et al., 2019; Huang et al.,\n2023). However, gesture-based methods require the user to\naccurately memorize and execute gestures corresponding to\nthe predefined commands, which is a challenge. The tactile\ninput generally uses only the pressure sensor arrays. This\nallows the user to express only a relatively simple intention\nYuzhi Lai, et al.:Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 2 of 19\nNVP-HRI\nwith low accuracy. EMG signals can only predict simple\nhuman intentions and cannot perform complex human in-\ntentions,suchasclearingthedesktop.Theaudioinput(Yang\net al., 2023, 2024b) is prone to ambiguity when describing\ncomplex scenarios (Yuan et al., 2024) because sentences\ncan be interpreted in multiple ways. To improve the intu-\nitiveness of HRI, we propose the NVP-HRI system, which\ncombinesthestrengthsofpostureandnaturallanguage.This\nmultimodal approach allows users to select objects with\ndeicticposture,avoidingtheneedfordetailedorambiguous\ndescriptions,whilecommandsaregiveninnaturallanguage,\neliminating the necessity to memorize complex gestures.\nMultimodal HRI approaches (Wang et al., 2017; Deng\net al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024a) show\ngreat potential to solve these issues. Fusion of gesture and\nfacial expression (Li et al., 2023a) is proposed to categorize\nhuman emotions for HRI. However, simple fusion is not ca-\npableofunderstandingcomplexhumanintentions.However,\nsimple fusion methods are not sufficient for understanding\ncomplex human intentions. In recent years, wearable mixed\nreality(MR)devices,suchasAppleVisionPro,haveshown\npromiseasmultimodalHRIinputdevices(Lietal.,2024d,b;\nPark et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024c).\nDespitetheirpotential,thesedevicescomewithsteeplearn-\ning curves, heavy weights, and high costs, making them\nunlikely to be widely adopted in elderly care and medical\napplications. In contrast, our proposed NVP-HRI system is\nbased solely on a microphone (Lei et al., 2025) and a depth\ncamera Xu et al. (2024a), eliminating the need for users to\nwear additional devices. This makes it more accessible and\nsuitable for everyday use, particularly in settings of elderly\ncare and patient assistance.\nAlthough robotics in the medical field often focuses on\nsurgical assist robots (Bian et al., 2023; Mahmood et al.,\n2022) and rehabilitation robots (Shah et al., 2024), these\napplications face stringent safety requirements and the need\nto handle complex and variable situations (Li et al., 2024a),\ndelaying widespread adoption. Service robots for elderly\ncare and patients, on the other hand, show more immedi-\nate potential. Current systems for the elderly or patients\noften require complex gestures or verbal commands due to\nineffective information integration. Leveraging LLMs with\nrobust reasoning offers promise for enhancing multimodal\ndataprocessing.ItcanbeappliedtovariableaspectsofHRI\n(Zhang et al., 2023), including social robots with special-\nized knowledge (Caruccio et al., 2024; Khennouche et al.,\n2024)androbottaskplanning(Singhetal.,2023).However,\nthere is still a large gap between innovations and practical\napplications Cao et al. (2020). LLMs can generate human-\nlike responses, but they can also generate inappropriate or\neven harmful content or actions due to the hallucination\nproblem. Recently, we have seen many applications (Huang\net al., 2023) that utilize pre-trained LLM with VLM to\nunderstand and interact with the environment (Jin et al.,\n2025; Li et al., 2024c). However, it is generally based on\nlanguage-only solutions. LLM-based posture and language\nfusion HRI models (Constantin et al., 2022) still need im-\nprovements to understand the context in 3D spaces and\nmanage interactions and behaviors. In our proposed sys-\ntem, we address these limitations by selecting the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) (Kirillov et al., 2023) over other\nunsupervisedsegmentationmodelsduetoitssuperiorability\nto extract detailed structural object representations and ease\nofimplementation.This,combinedwithdepthcamera data,\nallows the LLM to better understand 3D scenes (Esfahani\net al., 2019b; Ji et al., 2024b; Chen et al., 2024; Ma et al.,\n2024) and plan collision-free trajectories based on human\nintentions.\nWhen it comes to trajectory (Xu et al., 2024c; Bai et al.,\n2024; Hu et al., 2025) and action generation, traditional\napproaches have focused on methods such as preset greedy\nsearch(Garrettetal.,2018;Fengetal.,2024),behaviortrees\n(Tadewos et al., 2022), deep learning-based solution (Wu\net al., 2018, 2019b,c,a, 2021) or Bayesian inference (Jain\nandArgall,2018;Caoetal.,2022).Recently,theintegration\nof LLMs (Vemprala et al., 2023) into the generation of\nrobot actions (Qi et al., 2024) was examined, establishing\na pipeline to translate human intentions into robot action\nsequences using an LLM. However, LLMs face limitations\nin directly accessing sensor data, while Vision Language\nModels (Constantin et al., 2022) often require significant\ncomputational resources to generate sets of 2D embeddings\n(Liu et al., 2025). These embeddings frequently contain\nerrors and uncertainties, especially when encountering pre-\nviously unseen objects. Furthermore, LLMs are prone to\ngenerating incorrect responses due to hallucination prob-\nlems. Consequently, such LLM+VLM systems are prone\nto errors and mistakes, often requiring multiple trials to\nachieve success. To generate reliable action sequences, the\nsymbolic action sequences generated by LLM are checked\nby visualizing the trajectory. To minimize hallucination, we\nformulate prompts and impose constraints on the output\nresponse tokens generated by LLM.\n3. PROBLEM DEFINITION\nAnoverviewofourproposedNVP-HRIisshowninFig.\n2.

Verbal Command Sequence\nVerbal language input is used to compile a set of com-\nmands and metrics due to its intuitive and naturalness. We\ndivide into three types:\n• Action command: designated for prospective actions.\n• Approval command: used to confirm the location of\nthe selected object.\n• Metric references: designed as an optional part of\nhumanintention 𝐼.Thiscommandcouldincludevari-\nablessuchastheangleoftiltforpouringormovement\nvelocity.\nThe mapping  converts all verbal inputs into text and\nexecutes a query task to obtain the action intention𝐼𝑎 and\nthe metric𝜆.  is defined as:\n(𝐼𝑎, 𝜆)= () (1)\nYuzhi Lai, et al.:Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 4 of 19\nNVP-HRI\n3.2.2. Deictic Posture\nDeictic posture is a specific type of human posture used\nto indicate or point to an object, location, or direction. It\ninvolvesgesturessuchaspointingwithafinger,hand,orarm\nto direct attention and provide context in communication.\nNVP-HRI utilizes the RGBD input to generate the human\nposturesrepresentedby .Themappingtoobtainthetarget\nintentionbasedontherepresentationofthestructuralobject\nΓfrom the human postures is denoted as:\n𝐼𝑡 =(, Γ) (2)\nThe extended line 𝓁 of the right forearm of an operator\nextractedfrom representsthedeicticpostureandtheobject\nclosesttothevector 𝓁asthetargetintention 𝐼𝑡.Thedistance\nof an object in the structural representationΓ𝑘 ∈ Γwith\nthe centroid position of the 3D groups𝛾𝑘 to the vector𝓁is\ndescribed as𝑑𝑘(𝑙,𝛾):\n𝑑𝑘 =\n||(𝓁2 −𝓁1)×( 𝓁1 −𝛾𝑘)||\n||𝓁2 −𝓁1||\n(3)\nWhere𝓁1 and 𝓁2 are two random points from the vector𝓁.\nByintegratingthemulti-modalHRIcommandsequence\n and the structural object representationΓ, we can have\ngoodestimateofthehumanintention 𝐼,whichencompasses\nthe object intention𝐼𝑎, action intention𝐼𝑜, and metric pa-\nrameter𝜆:\n𝐼 ≜ (, Γ) (4)\n=(𝐼𝑎, 𝐼𝑡, 𝜆)\nInourproposedsystem,weemployGPT4(Brownetal.,\n2020) to decode a multimodal command sequence into\nhumanintention 𝐼,denotedbymapping .Therobotaction\nsequences 𝑎 are derived from the intention of humans𝐼\nthrough the mapping  ∶ 𝑎 = (𝐼). This mapping is\nalsoperformedutilizingGPT4.Finally,theactionsequences\ncross-checkedbythesweptvolumemodelandourproposed\nsystem are used to control the state of the end effector𝑞(𝑡)\nto fulfill the human intention𝐼.\n3.3. Construction of Complex Commands\nVarious action commands require various specifications\nfor the intention of the target. Simple tasks specify only the\nintention of the action and have no target intention (e.g.,\nmove to the initial position). For a human intention such\nas pick up this exotic fruit, both the action and the target\nintentions are necessary. In home service scenarios, human\naction intentions often occur in sequences, such aspick up\nthe exotic fruit and give it to me. In order to achieve this\ngoal, any two robotic actions in our multimodal HRI can be\nconstructed together:\n =(1,2)=( 𝐼𝑎1, 𝐼𝑡1, 𝐼𝑎2, 𝐼𝑡2, 𝜆) (5)\nHere, 1 and 2 denote the individual syntax commands.\n𝐼𝑎1 and 𝐼𝑎2 denoted the intention of action of each syntax\ncommand. 𝐼𝑡1 and 𝐼𝑡2 denoted the target intention of each\nsyntax command. NVP-HRI comprises a series of robotic\nactions characterized by increasing complexity:\n• Without a clear goal: reset position, drop, move, etc.\n• With targeted intention: pick, place, pour, etc.\n4. Methodology\nOur application scenario involves indoor service for the\nelderly, where the robot must perform tasks ordered by hu-\nmansefficientlyandnaturally.Someobjectsinthisscenario\nare rare and may not be recognized by pre-trained models.\nToaddressthis,NVP-HRIincludesvariousmodules,suchas\nverbalcommandunderstanding,zero-shotsemanticsegmen-\ntation by pretrained SAM, deictic posture estimation, action\nsequence generation, and execution.\n4.1. Verbal Commands Understanding\nIn the verbal commands understanding module, the in-\ntention and action metric are estimated from the raw audio\ninput.Thismapping  consistsoftwosteps.Thefirststep\nistheconversionofspeechtotext.Thesecondstepinvolves\naquerytasktorecognizetheintentionandtheactionmetric.\nAfter comparing various approaches (Trabelsi et al.,\n2022;AlphaCephei,2023;Radfordetal.,2023),wedecided\nto utilize the VOSK API (Trabelsi et al., 2022) based on the\nfollowingcriteria:(1)Recognitionaccuracy,(2)Recognition\nefficiency,and(3)Capabilitytoidentifyindividualspeakers.\n4.2. Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation\nThe semantic segmentation module extracts the repre-\nsentation of structural objects in the robot base frame by\nutilizingpre-trainedSAM 1 (Kirillovetal.,2023).Asshown\ninFig.3,theextractedsemanticmaskmaycontainincorrect\nsemantic meanings from the zero-shot prediction, which we\nwill ignore and will never be used in the system. Instead,\nthe texture and appearance clustering and grouping should\nremainrelativelystabletoprovideroughestimatesofobject\ncontours. In a random scene, we may have as many 2D\nclusters as possible. We then use the default calibration\nvalues , stored in the RGBD camera, to generate the\nreprojection matrix to project the RGBD 2D pixel𝑝into 3D\npointclouds 𝐶 through𝐶 =𝑝.Thus,setsof3Dcluster\ncandidates can be obtained in the camera frame. Here, we\nlimitthesizeofinteractableobjectstobewithinthewidthof\nthe manipulator end effector for interactions. Larger objects\nare stored for further scene understanding but are not used\nfor reference object selection. Subsequently, the transform\nmatrix𝐵𝐶 (TsaiandLenz,1989)isperformedtoobtainthe\n3Dpointcloudoftheobjectintherobotbaseframethrough\n𝐵 =𝐵𝐶\n𝐶.Where, 𝐶 denotedapointinthepointcloud\nin the camera frame and𝐵(.)denote a point in the point\ncloud in robot base frame represented as𝐵(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧 ). The\nobject position𝛾 in the scene is outlined as the centroid of\nthe object point cloud in the robot base frame:\n1Checkpoint:vit_l, Input Size:1024×1024×3\nYuzhi Lai, et al.:Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 5 of 19\nNVP-HRI\nFigure 3: Input and Output of SAM: Out of three objects, only two have correct semantic meanings. However, all of them are\nsegmented correctly.\n𝛾𝑘 =( 1\n𝑁\n𝑁∑\n𝑖=1\n𝑥𝑘\n𝑖, 1\n𝑁\n𝑁∑\n𝑖=1\n𝑦𝑘\n𝑖, 1\n𝑁\n𝑁∑\n𝑖=1\n𝑧𝑘\n𝑖) (6)\nWhere(𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖,𝑧𝑖)denotes the coordinates of a random point\nwith index𝑖in the point cloud of object𝑘in the robot base\nframe. The 3D clusters centroid position𝛾𝑘 is then used\nto calculate the distance, as described in Eq. 3. The object\nwidth 𝑤, thickness𝑑, and the object heightℎare defined\nas:\n𝑤=max 𝑥𝑘 −min 𝑥𝑘 (7)\nℎ=max 𝑦𝑘 −min 𝑦𝑘\n𝑑 =max 𝑧𝑘 −min 𝑧𝑘\nThe width, denoted by𝑤, will be used for the end effector\nopening, while𝑤, 𝑑 and ℎ together are used for the path\nplanning of the end effector and the cross-check of the\ntrajectory.\n4.3. Deictic Posture Estimation\nThis module is utilized to infer the intended object of\ninterest.Toensurethesystemfunctionality,theupperhalfof\nthe human body must be captured with an RGBD camera at\na sufficient distance, resulting in a larger area of interaction\ncompared to a Leap Motion-based solution. This can be\nconsidered as a hidden benefit of our approach. After that,\nwe utilized OpenPose (Cao et al., 2017) to track 2D human\nskeletons within the RGB image. Subsequently, the aligned\ndepth map is used to estimate the 3D human skeletons in\nthecameraframe.Thedirectionline 𝓁oftheextendedright\nforearmoftheoperatoristhenchosenasthedirectionofthe\ndeictic posture.\nThe intended object of interest can be computed in each\nframe in real-time. However, the relevant location becomes\naccessible only when the verbal approval command is iden-\ntified.Theprecisionandrobustnessofthedeicticpostureare\nevaluated in the following chapters.\n4.4. Action Sequence Generation and Execution\nThe translation of human intention𝐼 into a sequence of\nactions𝑎forarobotisachievedbythemappingfunction .\nIn the context of collision-free action sequence generation,\nan extensive understanding of the operational environment\nand the mission itself is required. To facilitate this process\nnaturally, we need a large language model for backend pro-\ncessing. To do that, we select GPT-4-turbo2 (Brown et al.,\n2020) for several reasons: its ability to encode high-level\nenvironmentalrepresentations,itsabilitytoprocesscomplex\nnatural language commands, its 3D spatial understanding,\nanditseaseofintegrationduetouser-friendlyAPIinterfaces\nand extensive pre-built samples. These features make GPT-\n4-turbo highly adaptable for a variety of scenarios. Acting\nas the central processor, GPT-4 handles multi-modal inputs\nand generates robot action sequences efficiently, ensuring\nsmooth, collision-free operation aligned with human inten-\ntions.\nIn order to address the potential issues of hallucination\nas well as tedious syntax structures in LLM, we formulate\nprompts and impose constraints on the output response\ntokensgeneratedbytheLLM.Theprompt,asshowninFig.\n4, is structured into three separate components:\n1. Action constraints: restricts the usages of actions.\nLLMislimitedtoutilizingtheseactionsforconstruct-\ning robot action sequences.\n2. Trajectory constraints: limit specific requirements for\nthe planning of the real-time trajectory, where it is\nnecessary to define the units and the coordinate axes.\n3. Exampletasks:illustratetheexecutionofsimilartasks\nandprovideguidanceontaskplanningstrategiesusing\nLLM.Byfollowingthisconstraint,LLMwillreplicate\nthe example task.\nAs shown in Fig 4, the GPT-generated plan first recon-\nstructsthestructuralrepresentationofthescenetodetermine\nthepositions,widths,andheightsofthemanipulatedobjects\nand obstacles. Subsequently, the safe height is established\nbased on trajectory constraints, and finally, the action se-\nquences are generated according to action constraints and\n2We use GPT-4-turbo with version 2024-04-09 and the training data\nretrieved in December 2023.\nYuzhi Lai, et al.:Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 6 of 19\nNVP-HRI\nFigure 4: The prompt is divided into action constraints, trajectory constraints, and example tasks, followed by a cross-check.\nCross-check results are fed back to the LLM, and if a collision is detected, a new trajectory is generated. Only sequences that\npass the cross-check are executed by the robot, resembling a closed-loop control system as in classical control theory.\ntrajectory constraints, forming a trajectory awaiting cross-\ncheck mechanism. This trajectory needs to be able to avoid\ncollisions.Theformatoftheactionsequencesisdetermined\nby the examples in the prompt to ensure uniformity.\n4.5. Cross-Check Mechanism\nTo plan a collision-free trajectory, LLM also needs to\nincorporate the spatial relations of objects in the scene\nthrough the structural representation of the objects. To fur-\nther enhance the safety and accuracy of NVP-HRI, the\ngenerated action sequences are subsequently cross-checked.\nThe decision to lift an object or move it horizontally is\nlargely determined by GPT, which operates as a black-box\nsystem with embedded common sense reasoning. In the\ndemo given in Fig. 2, GPT likely chose to lift the object to\navoid the obstacle because other options, such as moving\nin front of or behind the obstacle, might pose risks of\npotentialcollisions,suchaswithoccludedobjectsorswept-\narea collisions. Decision making is context-dependent and\nfullydependsoncommonsense.Inotherscenarios,theGPT\nmight choose a sloped movement to maintain observability\nof the system. This demonstrates that GPT, as a pre-trained\nblack-box model, possesses an inherent level of common\nsense and can adapt to different situations effectively.\nHence,inourproposedsystem,theobjecttobemanipu-\nlated is restricted by the trajectory constraints embedded in\nthepromptsalongthegeneratedtrajectorytocrossobstacles\nfrom above. In the cross-check process, the manipulated\nobject and obstacle are simplified to two rectangular shapes\nbased on their structural representationsΓ𝑀 and Γ𝑂. 𝔸 =\n∪𝑎∈[𝑎𝑠,𝑎𝑒]Γ𝑀𝜓(𝑎) represents the swept volume of the ma-\nnipulated object along the trajectory𝜓 from the start action\nsequence𝑎𝑠 totheendactionsequence 𝑎𝑒,asindicatedbyits\nstructuralrepresentation Γ𝑀.𝔹 =Γ𝑂 denotesthevolumeof\nthe obstacle, as determined by the structural representation\nΓ𝑂. If𝔸 ∩𝔹 ≠ ∅, then there is a collision in the trajec-\ntory. Under this circumstances, GPT-4 provides feedback\non the generated trajectory, including detailed explanations\nof failure causes, such as the exact location of a collision.\nThisexplanatoryfeedbackhelpsGPT-4adjusteffectivelyin\nsubsequent reasoning. If𝔸 ∩ 𝔹 = ∅, then the trajectory\nis collision-free. As shown in Fig. 4, the visualization of\nthe collision-free trajectory can be carried out efficiently by\nthe proposed solution. After passing the cross-check, the\nrobot executes the action sequences, resembling a closed-\nloop feedback system as in traditional control theory. The\ncross-check mechanism significantly improves the accuracy\nofcollision-freetrajectorygenerationandensuressafertask\nexecution, increasing the success rate of collision-free tra-\njectories from 73% to 94% compared to direct trajectory\ngeneration.\n4.6. Human-Robot Interaction\nHuman-robot interaction in our proposed NVP-HRI\nis accomplished by multi-modal command sequences, in\nwhich the user communicates intentions through verbal\ncommand sequences and deictic posture. Multi-modal com-\nmands are processed by, and visual feedback is provided\nthrough the graphical user interface to improve interaction\naccuracy and robustness.\n1) The user gives an action command by voice, which\nis estimated by  as the user action intention. 2) While\ncommanding the voice, the operator also has to make a\ndeictic posture giving the target object through mapping\n. With the approval command, the user determines the\nselection of the target object. 3) The user can optionally\ngive a metric command, which is estimated by as the\nmetric parameter for the human intention. In NVP-HRI, the\nusers express intentions using verbal commands and deictic\nposturesviaprocess ,whilereceivingvisualfeedback(see\nFig. 7) from the graphical user interface.\nTransitioning from multi-modal command sequence to\nhuman intention involves:\n1.

EXPERIMENT\nThe experiment aims to validate the superiority of our\nproposed NVP-HRI. To achieve this goal, we divide our ex-\nperiment into offsite survey approaches and onsite physical\ntrials. We conduct field offsite surveys to engage as many\npeopleaspossibletocollecttheexpecteduserexperienceto\nreflectintuitivenessandefficiency.Withasetofsurveycan-\ndidates, some agreed to our invitation and performed onsite\nteststoverifyaccuracyandprecision.Thus,wecanperform\nthe quantitative analysis of the proposed HRI framework.\nFurthermore, we verified the robustness of our proposed\nmethodforinteractingwithunknownobjectsandconducted\nperception tests in a real-world environment in an elderly\ncarecentertoshowcasethequalitativevalueoftheproposed\nHRI framework.\n5.1. Environment Setup\nThe experiment environment setup resembles a typi-\ncal living room scenario. An Intel D435i RGBD camera\nis strategically placed to oversee the area, providing clear\nvisibility of humans on the sofa, as well as the UR robot\nmanipulator and table. The RGB output of the camera is\n1024×768×3 , and the depth map is aligned with the RGB\nimage,resultinginanoutputof 1024×768×1.Toadapttothe\ninput requirements of different models (e.g., YOLOv5 and\nSAM), the camera’s output is resized to the corresponding\ndimensions. At present, we are utilizing the microphone on\nthenotebookforprocessing,asnodedicatedaudiodeviceis\navailable.\nOur system has been tested with 20 participants of dif-\nferent age groups in this environment, as depicted in Fig. 7.\nWe instructed participants to act as if they were unable to\nmove normally and to depend on the robot arm to transport\nitems within their reach. The objective was for the robot\narm to retrieve the necessary items for the participants.\nWhen testing our proposed system, some of these items,\nsuch as charcoal brioche and exotic tropical fruits, were\nnot recognized by the pre-trained object detection model\nor humans. Overall, this creates a realistic environment for\ntesting the HRI system.\n5.2. Description of Experimental Scenarios\nIn the experimental scenarios, a series of manipulation\nexperiments were devised to explore the increasing com-\nplexity of human intention, denoted as\n𝐼 =(𝐼𝑎1, 𝐼𝑡1, 𝐼𝑎2, 𝐼𝑡2, 𝜆):\n∙ (ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑒, −, −, −, −),(𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑤, −, −, −, −)\n∙ (𝑝𝑖𝑐𝑘, 𝑢𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡, −, −, −)\n∙ (𝑝𝑖𝑐𝑘, 𝑢𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡, 𝑝𝑢𝑡, 𝑏𝑜𝑤𝑙,−)\n∙ (𝑝𝑖𝑐𝑘, 𝑐𝑢𝑝, 𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑟, 𝑢𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡, 𝑎𝑛𝑔=90◦)\n∙ Multisteptasks: addwaterandpass,pourmuesliand\nadd milk.\n5.3. Benchmarking Criteria\nTheprimaryobjectiveistomeasurethedurationofuser\ninteractionwithgeneralobjectsandthesuccessrateforeach\ngiven scenario. The secondary objective is to evaluate the\nuser-friendlinessoftheNVP-HRI.Theperformanceofthese\nscenarios is demonstrated in the provided videos.\nRemark: To allow the existing method to work and to con-\nduct fair benchmarking in efficiency and time analysis, we\nuse a common recognizable item, such as cups and bowls.\nOtherwise, the existing method often cannot work with\nunknown items. The tests with rare objects are conducted\nseparately, as other methods fail to recognize the objects.\nTo minimize order effects during baseline comparisons, we\ntested the accuracy and duration of the interaction of all\nparticipants between the baseline methods and our pro-\nposed method, employing different interaction orders. We\nconducted two-way ANOVA (Analysis of variance) to de-\ntermine the effect of the order of interaction methods and\nthe age group of the participants on the comparison of\neffectiveness and precision.\n5.4. Baseline Selections\nIn our study, we benchmark our approach against other\nstate-of-the-art gesture-based HRI methods (Vanc et al.,\n2023), NLP (Natural Language Processing)-based meth-\nods (Stepputtis et al., 2020), and VLM (Vision Language\nModel)-basedmethods(Constantinetal.,2022).Thesebase-\nlinesarechosenbecauseallthesemethodshaveopensource\nimplementations and are somewhat similar to our approach.\nMost existing multimodal approaches (Stiefelhagen et al.,\n2004; Krupke et al., 2018) do not have open-source source\ncode for comparison, which prevents us from making direct\ncomparisons. The gesture-based (Vanc et al., 2023) utilizes\nafixedpositionleapmotion(Weichertetal.,2013)sensorto\ncapture the structure of the hand bone. The NLP and VLM\nmethods (Stepputtis et al., 2020; Constantin et al., 2022)\nuse natural language sentences to direct the actions of a\nrobot.

The natural language sentences struggle with distin-\nguishingbetweensimilarobjectsindifferentlocations\nand with unknown objects.\n4. VLM-based methods require an interactive dialog in\norder to select a target object and are, therefore, slow\nand unable to discriminate between the same objects.\nAdditional, the object detection modules of the baseline\nmethods we chose for comparison are based on supervised\nmodels(e.g.,FRCNN 3 (Renetal.,2016)andYOLOV5 4 (Li\netal.,2023b)).Methodsrelyingontheprecisepronunciation\nof objects cannot handle unknown objects. Therefore, for\nbaseline comparisons, we compare the duration and accu-\nracy of the interaction using common objects.\n6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWe evaluated the performance of our proposed NVP-\nHRI through a series of challenging experiments designed\nto assess criteria such as location robustness, accuracy, effi-\nciency, and user experience.\n6.1. Comparison of Effectiveness and Intuitiveness\nOur experimental scenario consisted of two cups with\nthe same shape and different colors, two bowls with the\nsame shape and different colors, and a plate. To evaluate\nthe duration costs of user interaction, we asked participants\nto enter the same commands and intentions using different\nHRIapproachesindifferentorders,includingpickingupone\nof the cups (S1), picking up one of the cups and putting\nit on the plate (S2), and picking up one of the cups and\n3Network: Resnet101, Input Size:1024×768×3\n4Checkpoint: YOLOv5l, Input Size:640×640×3\npick A pick A put in B pick A pour in B\nwith 90 degrees\nScenariaos\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16Interaction Time[s]\nOurs\nGesture-Based\nNLP-Based\nVLM-Based\nFigure 6: Duration of user interaction to enter the same\ncommands as the gesture-based HRI and NLP-based HRI, our\nsystem required less time compared to hand gesture-based HRI\nand NLP-based HRI.\npouring it at a 90-degree angle into one of the bowls (S3).\n24participantswererecruitedfromthelocaluniversity,8of\nwhom were over 51 years old. All participants were fluent\nin English and received verbal instructions on the NVP-\nHRIwithoutundergoingformaltrainingorpracticesessions.\nEach participant completed scenarios S1 through S3 in a\ndistinctorderofinteractionmethods,repeatingeachmethod\nfive times within each scenario. The experiment results,\ndepicted in Fig. 6, show that our system consumes 59.2%\nlesstimethangesture-basedHRI,65.2%lesstimethanNLP-\nbasedHRIand64.8%lesstimethanVLM-basedHRI.This\nexperiment highlights the enhanced efficiency of NVP-HRI\nin interaction within a complex 3D environment.\nWe categorized the participants into three different age\ngroups: those aged 18-35 belonged to the younger group,\nthose aged 36-50 belonged to the middle group, and those\naged 51-65 belonged to the older group. Table 1 shows the\nmeandurationofinteractionforparticipantsindifferentage\ngroups to enter the same command in different scenarios\nwith different HRI methods.\nIn order to further analyse the effect of age and the\neffect of interaction order, a two-way ANOVA is conducted\nto compare the effect of age group and interaction orders\non interaction duration across different scenarios. Table 2\nindicatesthattheorderofinteractionmethodsdoesnothave\na significant effect on the duration of the interaction (𝑃 >\n0.05). However, for baseline interaction methods including\ngesture-based (Vanc et al., 2023), NLP-based (Stepputtis\net al., 2020), and VLM-based (Constantin et al., 2022),\nage groups have a significant effect on interaction duration\nacross scenarios (𝑃 < 0.05).

In conclusion, our results suggest that interaction\nusing complex gestures and long sentences takes more time\nforolderusers,whileourproposedmethodusingonlyafew\ncommon syntaxes is more suitable for older users.\n6.2. Comparison of Precision and Robustness\nIn this experiment, we placed nine groups of unknown\nobjects,specifically18charcoalbriquettesarrangedinpairs,\nonatablewith20cmofseparationbetweenthemtotestHRI\naccuracy, as illustrated in Figure 7. Feedback provided by\nROS RVIZ visually indicates to the user the specific object\nbeing targeted, allowing evaluation of the accuracy of the\nNVP-HRI interaction in a challenging setting.\nThe same 24 participants from the previous experiment\nwere divided into two groups. All participants received\nverbalinstructionsonhowtouseNVP-HRI.Thefirstgroup\ncompleted the given scenarios three times without visual\nfeedback, resulting in a noticeable improvement in system\noperation accuracy after brief learning sessions. The sec-\nond group completed the scenarios with visual feedback,\ndemonstrating that the proposed NVP-HRI could be used\neffectively without formal training.\nTo further compare the accuracy of interaction with\nother baseline methods, we conducted another experiment\nwith participants in different age groups to test the accuracy\nof different interaction methods. Hundreds of trials were\nconducted for each interaction method in each scenario\nduring the experiment, and the results are shown in Fig. 8.\nGesture-based methods perform better than language-based\nmethods because gestures have more tractable reference\npoints. NLP-based and VLM-based methods often require\nmore precise and detailed descriptions and often have chal-\nlenges in discriminating similar objects.

Our system successfully retrieved\nvarious novel daily objects on demand, as shown in Fig. 10.\n7. LIMITATION AND FUTURE WORKS\nCurrently, the proposed method has been tested only\nin laboratory conditions with participants of various age\ngroups. The primary aim of this research is to provide\neasy access for elderly or ill individuals to control robots\nto perform daily routines. However, due to the nature of\nthe camera used in this mode, requests to conduct trials\nin hospitals were denied. Consequently, we have not been\nable to verify the system’s actual performance in real-world\nsettings.\nA significant limitation of our study is the demographic\nprofileofoursurveyparticipants.Thesurveywasdistributed\ntoindividualsassociatedwithuniversitiesaroundtheworld,\nwhich inherently biases the sample towards those with\nhigher educational backgrounds and better English fluency.\nThis raises questions about the system’s usability among\nindividuals with lower educational levels and different lin-\nguistic abilities. It is crucial to conduct further testing in\nmore diverse settings to determine whether the system can\nbe used effectively by a broader population.\nAdditionally, another challenge is to test the system’s\neffectivenessunderlow-lightconditions.Inourexperiments,\npose recognition is a critical component. However, the per-\nformance of pose detection may be compromised in low-\nlight environments. To address this issue, additional testing\nis necessary. We may also need to integrate supplementary\nsensors specifically designed to enhance pose detection in\nlow-light conditions.\nIn summary, while initial laboratory tests of the pro-\nposed method are promising, several aspects require further\ninvestigation. These include verifying the system’s perfor-\nmance in real-world settings, ensuring its usability among\na diverse population, and enhancing its effectiveness in low\nlight conditions. Addressing these issues will be crucial to\nthe successful deployment of this technology in practical\napplications.\n8. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, We introduce NVP-HRI, a multi-modal\nHRI paradigm combining voice commands and gestures,\nenabled by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for scene\nanalysis. NVP-HRI integrates with a large language model\n(LLM) for real-time trajectory solutions, achieving up to\n65.2% efficiency gains over traditional gesture control. We\nplan to open-source our code and methodology for greater\naccessibility.\nHowever,thecurrentsystemisdesignedonlyforEnglish\nspeakers and excludes those with hearing or speaking im-\npairments. Future work will prioritize integrating gestures\nYuzhi Lai, et al.:Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 13 of 19\nNVP-HRI\nand additional language models to enhance system versatil-\nity.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nYuzhiLai: Conceptualization,developmentofMethod-\nology and Software.Shenghai Yuan:Conceptualization of\nthisstudy,Writing-Originaldraftpreparation.
