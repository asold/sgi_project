Approximately \n50% of patients with SLE develop kidney- \nrelated complications, including LN, and \nup to 48% of those with diffuse prolifera-\ntive disease can progress to end- stage renal \ndisease within 5 years of diagnosis among \nAfrican- Americans.1 The American College of \nRheumatology (ACR) currently recommends \nchanging therapy when patients with LN are \ndeemed non- responders after for 6 months of \ninduction therapy.2 Clinicians use a variety of \nserum markers, including C3, C4, antidouble \nstranded DNA (anti- dsDNA) and creati-\nnine, as well as urine protein- to- creatinine \nKey messages\nWhat is already known about this subject?\n ► Individual elements of the International Society of \nNephrology/Renal Pathology Society renal histo-\npathological activity and chronicity indices associate \nwith lupus nephritis outcomes; however, individually, \neach element has poor predictive performance.\nWhat does this study add?\n ► This report demonstrates proof of concept that ma-\nchine learning techniques, including histopatholog-\nical and laboratory elements, can account for the \nheterogeneity of disease in lupus nephritis and pro-\nvide good prediction of approximately 1 year lupus \nnephritis suboptimal response in a largely African- \nAmerican population.\nHow might this impact on clinical practice or future \ndevelopments?\n ► The web- based clinical tool accompanying this re-\nport can be used by clinicians to initiate discussions \nwith patients and care teams about lupus nephritis \ncare coordination and monitoring; however, it needs \nto be tested in a prospective fashion to determine if \nmaking therapeutic decisions based on the predic-\ntions can improve outcomes.\nLupus Science & Medicine: first published as 10.1136/lupus-2021-000489 on 24 August 2021.

A decision support tool based on machine \nlearning models could be useful in determining the \nbaseline characteristics of patients who are less likely to \nrespond to induction therapy. Currently, no clinically \nuseful machine learning model of 1- year outcomes has \nbeen developed.

The \nCCCR database is sponsored by the NIH under the P30 \nmechanism and is longitudinal registry and biorepository \nof predominately African- American patients with SLE. \nPatients selected met at the ACR or SLE International \nCooperating Clinics criteria for SLE, 3 4  were evaluated \nby a rheumatology provider at MUSC, and agreed to \nbe enrolled in the cohort. The prospective longitudinal \ncohort database was created in 2003. Disease criteria and \nrenal biopsy data were largely entered prospectively, but \nsome were added retrospectively through chart review.\nInclusion criteria\nPatients were also selected if they had revised Interna-\ntional Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society \n(ISN/RPS) active class I, II, III, IV or V nephritis by histo-\npathology either at initial presentation of LN or with a \nworsening of LN indicating repeat biopsy between 2003 \nand 2017.5 Only patients with complete laboratory data \navailable at time of renal biopsy and approximately 12 \nmonths (7–24 months) after renal biopsy were included \nin the study.\nLaboratory analysis\nLaboratory values were obtained as part of standard \npatient care. Tests for 24- hour urine protein, protein- \nto- creatinine ratio, serum creatinine, albumin, haemo-\nglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, anti- \ndsDNA, C3 and C4 were performed by Clinical Labora-\ntory Improvement Amendments- certified central labora-\ntories at MUSC, LabCorp or external hospital laborato-\nries. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was \ndetermined by using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epide-\nmiology Collaboration (CKD- EPI) equation.6\nPathology analysis\nRenal biopsies were read by one of two renal patholo-\ngists at MUSC (SES or ETB) using the 2018 revised ISN/\nRPS activity (0–24) and chronicity (0–12) index elements \n(each scored 0–3 for 0%, <25%, 25%–50% and >50% \ninvolvement).5 Included in the activity index are endo-\ncapillary hypercellularity, karyorrhexis, fibrinoid necrosis, \nhyaline deposits, cellular or fibrocellular crescents and \ninterstitial inflammation. Scores were doubled for cres-\ncents and necrosis. Included in the chronicity index were \ntotal glomerulosclerosis score, fibrous crescents, tubular \natrophy and interstitial fibrosis.\nData handling\nData for the CCCR database were directly adjudicated \ninto the REDCap database using the Data Transfer \nService7 to eliminate transcription error. Some labora-\ntory values were extracted by chart review of the elec-\ntronic medical record and scanned lab reports and were \nentered manually into the database. Five per cent double \nentry of abstracted data was performed to ensure tran-\nscription error was <5%. Pathology reports were manu-\nally abstracted and entered into the registry if not already \npresent.\nStatistical analysis\nThe outcome variable was the failure to completely respond \nto therapy at approximately 1 year. This time point was \nchosen, as variables of response at 1 year are predictive of \nlong- term response years in the MAINTAIN and Euro- Lupus \nNephritis Trials.8 Response was defined by a modification \nof the ACR response criteria.9 The modifications to these \nTable 2 Univariate cvAUC for the subset of seven \npredictors selected for inclusion in the models\nVariable cvAUC\nActivity score 0.591\nChronicity score 0.660\nInterstitial fibrosis 0.643\nInterstitial inflammation 0.482\nUrine protein- to- creatinine ratio 0.503\nWhite blood cell 0.511\nHaemoglobin 0.524\nAUC, area under the curve; cvAUC, cross- validated AUC.\nTable 3 Prediction performance and variables selected for each model for the five models with a cvAUC >0.75\nModel cvAUC\nActivity \nscore\nChronicity\nscore\nInterstitial \nfibrosis\nInterstitial \ninflammation\nUrine \nprotein- to- \ncreatinine \nratio WBC Hgb\n# of \npredictors\nLR 0.780 X   X X   X X 5\nRF 0.800   X   X X X   4\nSVML 0.783 X   X X     X 4\nSVMR 0.790 X X X X   X X 6\nANN 0.775 X X X X X     5\nANN, artificial neural networks; AUC, area under the curve; cvAUC, cross- validated AUC; Hgb, haemoglobin; LR, logistic regression; RF , \nrandom forest; WBC, white blood cell.\nLupus Science & Medicine: first published as 10.1136/lupus-2021-000489 on 24 August 2021.

The suboptimal response outcome was \ndefined by lack of achieving complete response as defined \nabove. Thus, the outcome includes non- responders and \npartial responders. Variables collected in the data included \npatient sex, age at time of biopsy, proliferative disease \n(ISN/RPS classes III or IV, Y/N), mesangial disease (ISN/\nRPS class I or II, Y/N), membranous disease (ISN/RPS class \nV, Y/N), activity score (0–3), chronicity score (0–3), intersti-\ntial fibrosis (0–3), interstitial inflammation (0–3), number \nof glomeruli evaluated, crescents (number), crescent- to- \nglomeruli ratio (0–3×2), necrosis (0–3×2), urine protein- \nto- creatinine ratio, eGFR by the CKD- EPI formula (eGFR, \nmL/min/1.73 m²),6 serum creatinine (mg/dL), dsDNA \n(IU), C3 (mg/dL), C4 (mg/dL), white blood cells count \n(k/µL), platelet count (k/µL), haemoglobin (g/dL), \nserum albumin (mg/dL), prednisone (Y/N), hydroxychlo-\nroquine (Y/N), mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic \nacid (Y/N), cyclophosphamide (Y/N), rituximab (Y/N), \nazathioprine (Y/N) and number of medications. Since the \ndata were retrospective and not prospectively randomised, \nimmunosuppressants used for induction are subject to bias \nby indication and were not considered predictive. They \nwere excluded from consideration during model develop-\nment for clinical use, as their presence might imply that \nchoice of induction therapy based in the modelling might \naffect the outcomes. Descriptive statistics were calculated \nfor all participant characteristics by treatment response \ncategory. Univariate associations between all baseline char-\nacteristics and treatment response were evaluated using a \nseries of logistic regression models.\nThe goal for this study was to identify a parsimonious \nsubset of predictors from patient demographics and \nbaseline laboratory and biopsy data that yielded good \nprediction performance characteristics for a set of multi-\nvariable prediction models of suboptimal response at \napproximately 1 year. Multivariable classification models \nconsidered in this study included logistic regression (LR), \nclassification and regression trees (CART), random forest \n(RF), support vector machines with linear, polynomial and \nGaussian kernels (SVML, SVMP and SVMR, respectively), \nnaïve Bayes (NB) and artificial neural networks (ANN). \nRF models were fit using the ‘randomForest’ package; LR \nmodels were fit using the ‘stats‘ packages; SVMs and NB \nmodels were fit using the ‘e1071’ package; ANNs models \nwere fit using the ‘nnet’ available in R.11 12 Tuning param-\neters for the different models considered were selected \nbefore developing the models. An initial exhaustive search \nof all combinations of up to 20 variables was considered. \nHowever, the results from this search found the best average \nperformance occurred when models included eight vari-\nables (online supplemental figure 2). Thus, variable selec-\ntion was conducted using an exhaustive examination of all \nsubsets of eight or fewer predictors.

Specifically, \nprediction performance for each model’s subset of predic-\ntors was conducted using a 10- fold cross- validation (CV) \napproach. Ten- fold CV divides the data into 10 subsets. \nModels are trained using 9/10 of the data and tested on the \nremaining 1/10 of the data, and this is repeated for each \nsubset. The cross- validated area under the curve (cvAUC) is \nthe average AUC calculated for each subset of 1/10 of the \ndata excluded during model development and has been \nshown to be more robust than use of a single training- test \nset approach.13 The goal was to identify a small subset of \npredictors with good prediction performance across the \nmodels.14 Prediction performance was measured by 10- fold \ncvAUC and the best subset of eight variables was selected as \nthe subset that resulted in the highest average cvAUC across \nall models. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value \nand negative predictive values were determined for select \nthresholds for the predicted probability of non- response \nreturned by each model. All analyses were conducted in R \nV.4.0.2. An R- Shiny, web- based tool was created based on \nthe resulting models that were selected.\nRESULTS\nWithin the registry, 149 patients had renal biopsy infor -\nmation available between 2003 and 2017. Of these, 83 \npatients with LN had baseline and approximately 1- year \nfollow- up renal response data between 7.5 and 24 months \n(online supplemental figure 1). Three with follow- up <7 \nmonths and four with follow- up >2 years were excluded. \nApproximately half of the participants were classified as \nsubtoptimal responders at 1 year. Participant characteris-\ntics by treatment response are reported in table 1.\nThe subset of eight or fewer predictors yielding the \nbest prediction performance across the different models \nincluded activity, chronicity, interstitial fibrosis and inter-\nstitial inflammation scores and baseline laboratory values \nfor urine protein- to- creatinine ratio, white blood cell \ncount and haemoglobin. The univariate cvAUCs for these \nseven variables are shown in table 2. The cvAUCs for the \nbest models selected for each modelling approach range \nfrom 0.62 to 0.80 with the random forest model yielding \nthe best cvAUC. Five of the eight models considered had \na cvAUC >0.75 and included the LR, RF, SVML, SVMR \nand the ANN models.

Figure 2 \ndepicts the performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the \nmean of all the models based on the prediction threshold \nchosen. The CART, SVMP and NB models all had cvAUCs \n<0.7 and were excluded from further consideration.\nUsing the seven most consistent variables, a web- based \napplication was created with R shiny to serve as a clin-\nical tool and can be found here: (https://histologyapp. \nshinyapps.io/LN_histology_prediction_tool/). In the \napplication, an example of patient’s data is displayed \nby default. To evaluate a new patient, users can enter \nhistology and clinical laboratory values obtained at the \ntime of biopsy.

The box plots on the \noverview page represent the median (line), IQR (box) \nand the 25th and 75th percentile±1.5 times the IQR (whis-\nkers) of probability scores for suboptimal response in \nindividual patients in the responder and non- responder \ngroups in the validation sets (also depicted in figure 2A). \nEach coloured dot represents a single model prediction \nof the patient viewed in context of the performance of \nthe model in the validation set. The black ‘X’ represents \nthe mean predicted probability of non- response of all five \nmodels.\nDISCUSSION\nOur study determined that machine learning can be used \nto develop cross- validated models with good prediction \nof suboptimal response to therapy in patients with LN, \npredominantly of African descent. These models were \ndeveloped using readily available clinical laboratory \nand histopathological elements at the time of diagnosis. \nThe utility of individual histopathological features to \npredict outcomes in diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis \nis well described. Previous work has demonstrated the \npredictive strength of composite activity index score in \nprogression to renal failure, with individual histological \nfeatures of activity such as cellular crescents and fibri-\nnoid necrosis showing positive associations with renal \nfailure.15 The composite of chronicity index as well as \nindividual features such as interstitial fibrosis, glomerular \nsclerosis and fibrous crescents were also predictive, with \ntubular atrophic change determined to be of particu-\nlarly high predictive value with respect to progression to \nrenal failure. 15 The addition of clinical data elements, \nparticularly serum creatinine, haematocrit and race to \nhistological features improved prediction in subsequent \nwork, while other studies showed at use of stand- alone \nactivity or chronicity indices was insufficient in predicting \nresponse.16–19 Recent machine learning approaches have \nused multilinear regression and random forest model-\nling to predict of pathological classification, activity and \nchronicity from clinical laboratory values and have shown \npromise.20 This study expands on this approach by using \npathological variables to predict a outcome at approxi-\nmately 1 year.\nAs demonstrated in previous studies, the addition \nof novel biomarkers obtained at time of diagnosis \ncan be used to develop a robust model to predict the \n1- year outcome.21 However, no measures of these novel \nbiomarkers are in clinical use. In this study, readily avail-\nable histological and clinical laboratory values were used \nto predict LN outcomes with an ROC AUC of >0.75 in five \nmodels. This study is unique in that individual activity and \nchronicity score elements were used in machine learning \nmodels. This is supported by prior literature describing \ntheir use individually.15\nThe results of this prediction modelling should be \ninterpreted in the proper clinical context. The presence \nof high interstitial fibrosis with a low activity score is likely \nindicative chronic injury for which immunosuppres-\nsion would be used to prevent further worsening rather \nthan to restore renal function. However, those with high \nactivity scores might be approached with combination \nimmunosuppressive therapies or monitored for addition \nof second- line therapies sooner to improve or preserve \nrenal function. Given that these data were retrospective, \nwe do not know whether using the predictions to guide \ndecisions on induction therapy will change outcomes. \nAs is often the case in managing patients with autoim-\nmune disease, it would not be appropriate for a clinician \nto make decisions about choice of therapy based on this \nprediction score without consideration of the clinical \ncontext. However, a prediction of non- response could be \nused to change the frequency of monitoring for response \nand care coordination to ensure medication adherence. \nFigure 2 Mean model sensitivity and specificity based \non chosen prediction threshold. The mean of all model \npredictions was used to determine the performance of the \nmodel at select thresholds.

The information used \nto model outcomes came mostly from patients of African \ndescent. Therefore, use in clinical practice may be limited \nto this demographic. While the longitudinal data in this \nstudy were collected prospectively, the analysis was retro-\nspective. While thrombotic microangiopathy has been \nassociated with outcomes in prior studies, 22 the number \nof biopsies with this finding (five) limited its significance \nin the models. The decision aid presented here has not \nbeen used prospectively to determine if altering treatment \nstrategy based on prediction scores improves outcomes. \nIt has not been evaluated in the prediction of long- term \noutcomes and should therefore not be used to predict \n> 1- year outcomes. However, 1- year outcomes have been \nassociated with long- term outcomes in the MAINTAIN \nand Euro- Lupus Nephritis Trials.8 Selection of patients for \ninclusion in this study could bias outcomes. For instance, \nthose with more rapidly progressive renal disease are \nmore likely to receive a biopsy. Those with baseline and \napproximately 1- year follow- up available in the medical \nrecord may be biased to more favourable outcomes. We \ncould not rigorously study the effect of medications on \noutcomes, as most patients received mycophenolate or \nmycophenolic acid.\nGiven the heterogeneity of disease presentation in \nLN, it is important that risk prediction models incorpo-\nrate several data elements. This report provides for the \nfirst time a clinical tool that uses the five most predictive \nmodels and simplifies understanding of them through \na web- based application. With the prediction models \nproposed here, we present a proof of concept for a \ntool that can inform both the frequency of monitoring \nand facilitate discussions with patients about choice of \ntherapy. More closely monitoring or deploying care coor-\ndination for those who are predicted to have a subop-\ntimal response to therapy has the potential to improve \noutcomes but should be tested prospectively.\nAuthor affiliations\n1Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South \nCarolina, USA\n2Department of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, \nUSA\n3Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, \nCharleston, South Carolina, USA\n4Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South \nCarolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA\n5Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA\n6Medical Service, Ralph H Johnson VA Medical Center, Charleston, South Carolina, \nUSA\nAcknowledgements We would like the thank the lupus volunteers in our \nlongitudinal registry, who made this work possible.\nContributors LNH: data collection, authorship.
