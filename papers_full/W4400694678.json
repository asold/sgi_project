  "abstract": "Cervical spondylosis is the most common degenerative spinal disorder in modern societies. Patients require a great deal of medical knowledge, and large language models (LLMs) offer patients a novel and convenient tool for accessing medical advice. In this study, we collected the most frequently asked questions by patients with cervical spondylosis in clinical work and internet consultations. The accuracy of the answers provided by LLMs was evaluated and graded by 3 experienced spinal surgeons. Comparative analysis of responses showed that all LLMs could provide satisfactory results, and that among them, GPT-4 had the highest accuracy rate. Variation across each section in all LLMs revealed their ability boundaries and the development direction of artificial intelligence.",
