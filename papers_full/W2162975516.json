These systems usually require the conversion of a low \nvoltage input to a high voltage output across a discharge capacitor (> 100V).  \nExamples include photographic flash (e .g. for driving xenon flashlamps in \ncameras and cell phones) and emergency warning beacons.  The flyback \ntopology provides a simple and cost-effective method for stepping up to high \nvoltage and consequently finds widespread use in these applications [1].  For the \nmajority of these systems, the transformer represents one of the largest and \nmost expensive components.  There exists a growing need for miniature, low \nprofile, low cost transformers for use in these applications to support current \ntechnology trends which continually push for lower cost and size reduction.  \nEfforts in recent years have focused on the use of low-profile magnetic core \n 8\nstructures with printed circuit board (PCB) coils to shrink the size of the \ntransformer used in power processing syst ems [2, 3].  However, for high-voltage \nconverter designs that require transformers with a large turns ratio and a large \nnumber of windings, the integration of t he coil into the PCB structure requires \nmultiple conductor layers in the PCB design.  This can significantly increase the \ncost and complexity of the PCB.   \n \nThis paper discusses the design of low-temperature (850°C to 950°C) co-fired \nceramic (LTCC) ferrite-based transformers for use in high voltage flyback \nconverter systems.  LTCC ferrite combined with screen printable silver conductor \nand low permeability dielectric produces small surface mountable transformers \nwith no wire or discrete core.  The LTCC transformers integrate the conductor, \ninsulator and magnetic materials into a s ingle monolithic device, leading to size \nreduction and a very low profile.  This approach provides automated, parallel \ntransformer manufacturing which supports low component cost. \n \nBackground on Flyback Converters \nFigure 1 shows the basic flyback converter circuit assuming an ideal transformer.  \nDuring the time interval when the gate drive turns the switching metal-oxide-\nsemiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) on, current flows only through the \nprimary since the diode prevents curr ent flow in the secondary winding.  This \nresults in stored energy on the primary during the time interval that the MOSFET \nconducts.  The amount of energy stor ed depends on the peak current in the \nprimary (I\npk) before the switch turns off, as determined by the drive voltage Vin, \nprimary inductance Lp and turn on time ton of the switch: \non\np\nin\npk tL\nVI =       ( 1 )  \nWhen the MOSFET switch turns off the current flow through the primary winding, \nthe mutual coupling of the transformer transfers the stored energy to the \nsecondary.  Since the current in an inductor cannot change instantaneously, the \n 9\ncurrent on the primary transfers to the secondary.  The resulting current flows \nthrough the diode and generates a voltage drop across the output capacitor.  The \ntotal voltage across the capacitor increas es each switching cycle until it reaches \na maximum limited by the transformer output capabilities (assuming the circuit \nruns without feedback regulation as show n in Figure 1).  For a given flyback \ntransformer design, energy transfer to the secondary stray capacitance governs \nthe maximum achievable output voltage: \nstray\np\npoutsoutstrayppp\nC\nLIVEVCILE =⇒=== 22\n2\n1\n2\n1\n  (2) \nwhere Ip is the primary current, Cstray is the secondary stray capacitance, Ep is the \nenergy stored on the primary, Es is the energy stored on the secondary and Vout \nis the output voltage across the secondary load. \n \nFigure 2 provides theoretical primary current and output voltage waveforms for \nthe simple flyback circuit shown in Figure 1.  Note that the present work focuses \nonly on the discontinuous mode  of operation, in which al l energy transfers to the \nload during the off time of each switching cycle before the switch turns on again.  \nThis energy transfer is evident by the leveling of V\nout during the MOSFET off time \nin Figure 3. \n \nFigure 1: Flyback converter circuit schematic assuming an ideal transformer. \n \n \nQ\nCstray Cout\nDIODETransformer\nLp Ls\n 10\n \nFigure 2:  Waveforms showing theoretical operation of the flyback converter.  During the \ntime the switch conducts, the current ramps linearly through the primary.  When the \nswitch turns off, energy transfers to the secondary and increases the voltage across the \noutput capacitor. \n \n \nThe preceding analysis assu mes an ideal transformer and ign ores the effects of \nleakage inductance on the circuit.  For a transformer the total primary inductance \nactually consists of two components (refer to Figure 3): the component which \ncreates a flux that links the secondary, termed the magnetizing inductance, L\nmp; \nand the component which creates a flux that links only the primary, termed the \nleakage inductance, L\nlp.  The leakage inductance decreases overall efficiency \nsince the energy stored in the leakage inductance does not transfer to the \nsecondary when the switch turns off [4].  Only the primary magnetizing \ninductance,  \nlppmp LLL −= ,      ( 3 )  \ncontributes to the transferred energy.  The coupling coefficient, k, of the \ntransformer provides a relationship between the leakage and magnetizing \ninductances, and is defined in this article as: \np\nmp\np\nLpp\nL\nL\nL\nLLk =−=      ( 4 )  \nPerfect coupling results in a value of unity for the coupling coefficient.   \n \nt\nIp\nVout\n 11\nSubstituting magnetizing inductance in place of primary inductance in Equation \n(2) provides a relationship between the maximum achievable output and the \ncoupling coefficient: \nstray\np\np\nstray\nmp\npout\nC\nLkIC\nLIV ==     (5) \nAdditionally, note that only the flux that  links the secondary contributes to the \nmutual inductance, M, of the flyback transformer: \npmp NLkNLM 2== ,      ( 6 )  \nwhere N is the ratio of secondary to primary turns (i.e. the transformer turns \nratio).  This leads to the definition of an effective turns ratio for the transformer, \nNkNeff\n2= .       (7) \n \nBesides degrading efficiency, the leak age inductance also impacts overall \noperation and performance of the converter circuit.  Unlike the primary \nmagnetizing inductance, no alternative path exists for the leakage inductance \ncurrent when the switch turns off (recall that the magnetizing current transfers to \nthe secondary when the switch turns off).  Instead, current in the leakage \ninductance continues to flow since cu rrent through an inductor cannot change \ninstantaneously.  In other words, the leakage inductance behaves as an \nunclamped inductive load when the switch turns off.  The charge that continues \nto flow after the switch turns off accumulates onto the parasitic elements in the \ntransformer and the switch.  This creates a sharp voltage spike on the drain of \nthe MOSFET with a magnitude determined by the parasitic elements and the \nenergy stored in the leakage inductance.  The voltage spike adds to the input \nvoltage and reflected output voltage, leadin g to a total peak voltage on the drain \nof the switch given by [4]: \nossp\nlp\np\neff\nout\nindss\nCC\nLIN\nVVV +++=    (8) \n 12\nwhere Vin is the input voltage, Cp is primary winding capacitance in the \ntransformer, and Coss is the output capacitance of the MOSFET. \n \nFigure 3: Flyback converter circuit schematic that includes effects of leakage inductance. \n \n \nSnubber circuits can be used to suppress the voltage spike [4].  However, they \nare not utilized in this work.  Details of the experimental setup are provided later \nin this paper.  \n \nBackground on LTCC Transformer Construction \nLTCC is a well-established process that has been in use for many years in the \nmicroelectronics packaging industry.  The process for building transformers uses \na ferrite-based green tape prepared from a slurry of ceramic oxides, plasticizers, \nbinders, and solvents. The slurry is cast onto a mylar carrier film moving under a \nknife-edge, the height of which determines the tape thickness.  Air drying the \nslurry removes the solvent and allows the formation of the tape—which is only a \nfew thousandths of an inch (mils) thick.  \n \nThe tape is then cut into sheets that become the individual layers of an \nassembly, called a “stack.”  A single sheet may be large enough to contain a \nmatrix of hundreds of transformers, similar to IC wafers.  The sheets are punched \nwith a series of holes for both tooling alignment and for via interconnections \nLlp Lls\nQ\nCstray Cout\nDIODETransformer\nLmp Lms\n 13\nbetween layers.  Vias are t hen filled with a conductive material using a stencil \nand screening process.  The next step involves screen printing conductive \npatterns onto each sheet that represent the windings and interconnecting traces.  \nFigure 4 provides an illustration of a s heet with printed conductor windings for a \n1:2 transformer design.   \n \n \nFigure 4: Screen printed conductive coils for a 1:2 transformer design on a ferrite sheet. \n \nThe next and final print ing applies a low permeability ma terial to selected areas, \ncreating a magnetic path structure critical to the transformer performance [5-7].  \nLater discussion will il lustrate the effects of this dielectric layer on performance.  \nFigure 5 provides an illustration of one of the coils in Figure 4 after screen \nprinting the low permeability dielectric. \n \n \nFigure 5: Highlight of a transformer winding after applying a low permeability dielectric. \n \nThe sheets are then aligned and stacked together.  High-pressure pressing, or \nlaminating, melds all the layers into a solid  mass.  The matrix of transformers is \nthen singulated into in dividual pieces.  Next, they ar e fired in a furnace following \n\n 14\na precise and carefully controlled temper ature profile with peak temperatures in \nexcess of 800°C.  The firing process burns off the organic binders and \nplastisizers, and then sinters the layers and printings into a solid monolithic \nstructure, physically bonding the partic les together.  Unless there are special \ntermination requirements, the parts are complete and ready for testing, \npackaging, and shipment. \n \nAs mentioned previously, the transformer processing includes the addition of a \nlow permeability dielectric to the transfo rmer structure.  Without the low \npermeability dielectric, upon firing the coils become completely embedded in \nferrite with uniform permeability throughout.  This results in very poor coupling \nand extremely poor transformer performance.  Figure 6 provides an illustration \nfrom a Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) finite element model [8] that \nshows the flux distribution in an LTCC transformer without the low permeability \nlayers.  (The figure shows a two-dimensional axisymmetric cross section for one \nhalf of the transformer.)  Note that the design possesses an interleaved winding \nstructure (primary sandwiched between seco ndary windings) and an 8 to 1 turns \nratio.  The image clearly shows the poor flux linkage with the secondary, with a \nlarge portion of the flux traveling through the regions of the transformer that \ncontain the secondary windings.  The inclusion of the low permeability layer over \neach winding layer creates a higher reluctance magnetic path through the \nwinding regions.  The flux therefore prefers the low reluctance core path, thereby \nleading to a considerable improvement in the coupling.  Figure 7 provides FEMM \noutput for the same transformer in Figure 6, with the low permeability layers.  The \nstructure possesses noticeably improved coupling.  \n \nSimilar to the formation of the high reluctance path through the windings regions, \nthe low permeability dielectric can also provide a method for incorporating a high \nreluctance path through the core.  This provides the same benefits as adding an \nair gap to a conventional wirewound flyba ck transformer; namely, it prolongs the \nonset of saturation and allows for increased energy storage.  In the case of the \n 15\nLTCC transformer, the gaps are completely monolithic and embedded between \nthe ferrite tape layers.  All of the des igns discussed in this article include \nmonolithic dielectric gapped cores, and subsequent sections will illustrate the \neffect of the gap on performance.  Note that relatively minor differences in the \ndielectric print thickness for a build can impact final inductance of the design \nsince the cumulative effect on multiple layers alters the transformer reluctance.  \nConsequently, inductance can vary from one lot build to another.  This should be \nkept in mind for the results presented in this paper. \n \nFigure 6: Output from a FEMM model showing poor coupling for an LTCC transformer \nwithout low permeability dielectric over the winding layers.  A large portion of the flux \ntraverses through the secondary windings.  The primary current was set to 1 Amps in the \nmodel. \n \nFigure 7: Output from a FEMM model showing the improved coupling obtained when \nincluding a low permeability dielectric layer on top of each winding print.  The dielectric \nlayers channel the flux to the center core area.  The primary current was set to 1 Amps in \nthe model. \n\n 16\nExperimental and Modeling Setup \nFigure 8 provides an electrical schematic  showing the circuit used to test the \noutput performance of the LTCC transformers.  All output voltage measurements \nutilized a 100:1 resistive divider.  The reported transformer output voltages in the \narticle correspond to the peak voltage measured across a 0.1 µF output capacitor \nwith a 15 Volt input voltage and a 50 kH z switching frequency.  Note that an \noscilloscope was utilized to determine the peak output voltage achieved across \nthe capacitor.  The MAX4427 MOSFET driver translates the HP8112A function \ngenerator output to a high voltage/current output for efficiently turning the IRF740 \nMOSFET on and off.   All experiment s operated with no feedback regulation in \norder to determine the maximum output capability for the transformer. \n \nFor basic parameter testing, all inductance measurements were performed using \na Wayne Kerr PM3260B Precision Magnetics Analyzer set to 100kHz, 100 mV.   \nThe leakage inductance, L\nLp, represents the inductance measured across the \nprimary with the secondary windings short ed.  A Valhala Scien tific 4014 Digital \nOhmmeter provided all winding resistance measurements. \nFigure 8: Circuit schematic of the experimental setup for testing high voltage output. \n \n \n 17\nAll reported simulation results used the Finite Element Method Magnetics \n(FEMM) software [8].  FEMM uses a t wo-dimensional solver, and each model \nassumed axial symmetry (i.e. a circular winding).  Correspondingly, the models \nonly calculate the flux distribution in one half of the transformer.  For transformer \ncores with elliptical or “stretched” windings, the winding and core radii used in the \nmodel were set to the average of the radius length and radius width from the final \nphysical dimensions.   \nLTCC Transformer Designs \nFor this effort four LTCC transformer designs were built and tested.  Each design \nused the same base materials for its construction.  For the ferrite, the 40012-28J \nmagnetic tape produced by ESL ElectroScience was used.  This tape provides a \nfinal relative permeability > 450 when co-fired into transformers with the \nconductor and dielectric materials.  The transformers also utilized ESL \nElectroscience’s 4926-RJ series dielectric paste for the low permeability \ndielectric.   Finally, all windings (primary and se condary) were formed using \nESL's 903-CT-1J screen-printable silver conductor paste, and ESL’s 902-J paste \nwas used for filling vias. \n \nThe designs consist of two different winding structures: one with the primary \noutside of the secondary windings, as s hown on the left side of Figure 9; and an \ninterleaved structure with the primary sandwiched between the secondary \nwindings, as shown on the right side of Figure 9.  The top left design, referred to \nas the D47 transformer, measured 0.36” width, 0.39” length and approximately \n0.08” height.  The top right design, referred to as the D50E transformer, \npossessed similar dimensions.  Both the D47 and D50E designs contained \nstretched windings to maximize their core area.  The bottom two designs, \nreferred to as the D48A and D48B designs, possessed final dimensions of 0.3” \nwidth, 0.3” length and 0.08” height.  All of the designs possess an 8 to 1 turns \nratio, except the D47 (upper left) which possesses an 8.5 to 1 ratio.  Table 1 \nsummarizes the transformer physical dime nsions and also provides information \n 18\nregarding the primary and secondary trace widths, primary to secondary spacing, \nand total number of turns for each winding.   The table also lis ts the edge margin, \ndefined as the space between the outermost winding and the edge of the \nsingulated part.  The shortest distance from  the center of the part to the first \nwinding is referred to as the core radius , and the stretch defines the increase in \nthe core diameter along the orthogonal direction for the D47 and D50E designs.

The number of windings N\nW refers to the total number \nof winding layers (shown in Figure 9) sta cked in the transformer.  The number of \ngaps NG refers to the number of low permeability dielectric gaps contained in the \ncenter core area.  Note that all of the dielectric gaps are placed on the \ncentermost tape layers in the designs.  All of the designs possess relatively poor \ncoupling and a large primary leakage induc tance.  This occurs because the \ntransformer structure consists of windings possessing a relatively low reluctance \npath, even with the addition of the low permeability dielectric over the windings.  \nThe interleaved designs possess ed higher coupling  and lower leakage \ninductance, a benefit that this coil geometry also provides when used for \nwirewound transformers.  Modeling results and discussion in other parts of this \npaper will provide further insight into the coupling characteristics of the LTCC \ntransformer.   \n \nTable 2: Basic parameter data for the four experimental transformer designs. \n \nFigure 10 shows the peak voltage achieved across the output capacitor at \ndifferent peak current levels through the primary for each of the four designs.

Note that the switch turn on time controls the peak current level \nper Equation (1).  Despite the poor coupling, all of the designs provided peak \noutput voltages in excess of 2 kV, with the maximum output of 2.8 kV provided by \nthe D50E transformer.  The D48A and D47 designs possessed much higher \nprimary inductance and generated higher output voltage at lower currents, as \nexpected based on the relationship between primary inductance and output \nvoltage shown in Equation (5).  Despite their  lower inductance, the interleaved \ndesigns (D48B and D50E) ach ieved higher peak output than the other two \ntransformer designs, albeit at higher current levels.  This occurs for two \nfundamental reasons.  First, as shown in Equation (5), the higher coupling for \nthese designs allows more energy tr ansfer to the secondary and hence higher \noutput voltage.  However, the coupling c oefficients shown in  Table 2 do not \ncompletely explain the large output difference observed on these transformers.   \nFigure 10: Output voltage versus peak primary input current for the designs summarized \nin Table 1 and Table 2. \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4 4.2\nPeak Input Current (A)\nOutput Voltage (kVDC)\n2146YD48A37\n2146YD48B40\n2138YD47x07\n2144YD50E12\n2144YD50E13\nD50E\nD47\nD48B\nD48A\n 21\nUnderstanding the output voltage performanc e also requires consideration of the \nflyback circuit operation.  Equations (7) and (8) show that the coupling and \nleakage inductance impact the voltage stress V\ndss across the MOSFET when the \nswitch turns off.  Figure 11 shows the output voltage for each transformer design \nversus the peak voltage appearing across the switch during the off time of each \nswitching cycle.  All four designs show  an increase in output voltage until the \nvoltage across the switch reaches 450V.  At this point the voltage generated \nacross the switch exceeds the maximum V\ndss rating (400V for the IRF740) and \nthe MOSFET suffers an avalanche breakdown.  This effectively clamps the \noutput across the secondary for any further increase in the primary current, as \nevident in Figure 10.  Correspondingly, the output voltages in Figure 10 represent \nthe maximum achievable output for the different transformer designs when \nutilized in the setup shown in Figure 8.  Note that the large V\ndss voltages result \nfrom the high leakage inductance of these transformers.  As expected from \nEquations (5) and (8), designs with higher  coupling (D48B and D50E) achieve a \nhigher output voltage before reaching the V\ndss limitation of the switch.  During the \nexperiments the primary current was monitored and never showed any evidence \nof transformer saturation.  This suggests all four transformer designs can achieve \nhigher output voltage when using a MOSFET with a larger V\ndss rating. \nFigure 11: Output voltage versus peak voltage across the MOSFET drain and source for \nthe designs summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500\nVdss Voltage (VDC)\nOutput Voltage (kVDC)\n2146YD48A37\n2146YD48B40\n2138YD47x07\n2144YD50E12\n2144YD50E13\nD50E\nD47\nD48B\nD48A\n 22\nAs mentioned previously, the designs with an interleaved primary provide higher \ncoupling and hence lower leakage inductanc e.  Figure 12 provides output \ncontour plots from FEMM models that compare the D47 design and the D50E \ndesign at the same primary input current of 1.5 Amps.   The plots show that the \nsecondary windings located inside the primary winding create a large leakage \npath for the flux.  Recall that the transformer construction uses the same low \npermeability dielectric material for both the “gaps” located in the center core area \nand the high-reluctance layers deposited on  top of the windings .  Consequently, \nthe center core region and the secondary windings region possess a similar \nreluctance.  This results in the high leakage through the secondary windings \nlocated inside the primary windings.  S ince the interleaved structure possesses \nfewer secondary windings located inside the primary winding, less flux leaks \nthrough this region.   Additionally, for the interleaved structure the flux path \noutside the primary winding favors the lo w reluctance outer edge (which contains \nno low permeability material) over the higher reluctance windings region.  This \nimproves the flux linkage with the secondary.  Figure 13 shows the flux density \nalong the centerline of the part from the same models (the centerline runs from \nthe center of the part out radially to the edge of the part), which further illustrates \nthe significantly improved coupling for the interleaved parts. \nFigure 12: FEMM plots showing field contours for the D47 (top) and D50E (bottom) designs \nat 1.5 Amps magnetizing current. \n\n 23\nFigure 13: Plots showing flux density along the transformer centerline for the D47 (top) \nand D50E (bottom) designs at 1.5 Amps magnetizing current. \n \nFigure 14 plots the primary inductance of the D48A, D48B and D50E designs \nversus the primary winding radius (for the stretched D50E design, the radius is \nthe average along the horizontal and vertical axes in Figure 9).  Note that these \nthree designs possessed the same number of winding, gap and tape layers.  The \ninductance scales linearly with the prima ry winding radius.  This results since the \nflux sees a similar reluctance path inside the primary winding for these designs \nwhether it travels through the center core or the windings region (refer to Figure \n12).  Note that this relationship will only  occur when the center core contains \n\n 24\nseveral dielectric “gaps”.  Without the gaps, or with only a few gaps, the center \ncore region will possess a much lower re luctance than the windings region.  This \nresults in a higher primary inductance that scales with the center core radius \n(instead of the primary winding radius).  In fact, LTCC transformer designs \nwithout gaps in the center core area also exhibit much higher coupling since the \nflux prefers the low reluctance core over the windings region.  A comparison of \nFigure 7 with Figure 12 illustrates this effect.  Unfortunately, the ungapped LTCC \ntransformers saturate at low magnetizing currents and therefore provide poor \nflyback performance.   \nFigure 14: Primary inductance plotted as a function of the primary winding radius. \n \nReferring to Table 2, the D47 and D50E  parts show higher coupling than the \nD48A and D48B designs, respectively.  As  the primary winding radius increases \nfor the two different design structures shown in Figure 9 (8s:1p and 4s:1p:4s), the \nratio of the center core area to total area inside the primary winding increases.  \nTherefore, the reluctance of the center core region decreases relative to the \nreluctance of the winding region.  Consequently more flux links the secondary for \nthe designs with a larger primary radius, leading to a higher value for the \ncoupling coefficient k. \n15.00\n17.50\n20.00\n22.50\n25.00\n27.50\n30.00\n32.50\n35.00\n37.50\n40.00\n80.00 85.00 90.00 95.00 100.00 105.00 110.00 115.00 120.00 125.00 130.00\nPrimary Radius (mils)\nInductance (uH)\nD48B\nD50E\nD48A\n 25\nImpact of Winding Structure on Performance  \nThe LTCC transformer design incorporates multiple layers that contain the \ntransformer windings (such as those shown in Figure 9).  The number of turns for \nthe primary and secondary can be controlled by adjusting the number of these \nlayers included in the final part stack- up.  To better understand how this may \nimpact transformer performance, a number of D48 transformer designs were built \nwhich varied the number of tape layers ( L), number of winding layers ( N\nW) and \nnumber of gap layers (NG).  Table 3 includes the parameter data for each design.  \nAll the inductance and resistance values increase as the number of windings \nlayers increased, an expected result.   \n \nTable 3: Basic parameter and build data for the D48 transformers used to investigate the \nimpact of winding structure on performance. \n \nFigure 15 plots the primary inductance versus the number of windings layers.  As \nevident in the figure, the primary induct ance shows a roughly linear relationship \nwith the number of winding layers.  ( Note that the number of gap layers and \nnumber of tape layers also change between the designs.)  The primary \ninductance depends on the number of primary turns, N\np, and the transformer \nprimary reluctance, pℜ : \np\np\np\nNL ℜ=\n2\n.

Conseque ntly, from Equation (9) the primary \ninductance varies linearly with the number of windings layers in the design. \nFigure 15: Primary inductance plotted versus number of winding layers for the designs \nsummarized in Table 3. \n \nReferring to Table 3, increasing the num ber of winding layers shows a positive \nimpact on coupling for the designs with the fewest winding layers, but no \ncoupling improvement was achieved beyo nd twelve winding layers.  Figure 16 \nshows the impact of the different designs on output voltage performance for both \nthe D48A and D48B designs.  Increasing the number of windings layers provides \nhigher output at a given primary current, as expected based on the relationship \nbetween primary inductance and output voltage shown in Equation (5).  \nIncreasing the number of winding layers also reduced the voltage stress on the \nswitch, as shown in Figure 17 for the D48B designs.

Table 4 summarizes the D48B \ndesigns used to study this effect.  The designs varied the number of gaps located \nin the center core area, with all other variables held constant.  Note that all of the \ngaps were placed on the centermost t ape layers in the design.  Table 4 shows a \nslightly larger primary inductance for the design with six gap layers, but relatively \nlittle difference for eight and ten gap layers.   (Recall that the LTCC transformers \ncan exhibit variability from lot to lot, es pecially for differences in the dielectric \nprint thickness.  The inductance for the eight and ten gap designs falls within \nnormal variation.)  As discussed prev iously and shown in Figure 12, the \ntransformer reluctance depends primarily on the area inside the primary winding, \ni.e. the parallel combination of the sec ondary windings reluctance and the center \ncore reluctance.  While increasing the number of gaps increases the center core \nreluctance, the reluctance of the sec ondary windings located inside the primary \nremains constant.  Increasing the number of gaps will have little effect on this \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\nVdss Voltage (V)\nOutput Voltage (kVDC)\n2037YB21\n2037YB29\n2037YB62\n2040YB12\n2040YB43\n2040YB54\n2031Yb17\n2031Yb50\n2031Yb62\n2039YB17\n2039YB18\n2039YB26\n2038YB11\n2038YB17\n2038YB26\n2038Y=16T\n2039Y=14T\n2031Y=12T\n2040=10T\n2037Y=8T\n 29\nparallel reluctance combination once the center core reluctance exceeds the \nsecondary winding reluctance.  For the D48B  design, the center core region \npossesses a cross sectional area over three times smaller than the secondary \nwindings region located inside the prima ry winding.  Consequently, the center \ncore region possesses a higher reluctance than the secondary windings region \nfor the designs summarized in Table 4. This explains the relatively minor impact \nof the gap structure on inductance.  Due to the small primary inductance \nvariation, the designs all exhibited very comparable output voltage performance.  \nTests were also conducted that placed the dielectric gaps on different tape layers \nin the center core region, and similar results were obtained. \n \nTable 4: Build and parameter data for the D48B design used to study the impact of gap \nstructure on performance. \n \n \nImpact of Endcap Structure on Performance  \nFor the LTCC transformer design and construction, the tape layers placed above \nand beneath the windings layers – referred to  as the endcap layers – present the \nlowest cross sectional area to the flux generated by the primary winding.  \nConsequently, the endcap layers play an important role on the dynamic \nsaturation characteristics of these devices.  To study the impact of the endcaps \non design performance, two D50E tr ansformers designs were built and \ncharacterized.  Table 5 summarizes the construction and measured parameters \nParameter Units 2030Y 2031Y 2032Y\nPrimary Inductance, Lpri μH 19.37 16.75 17.13\nPrimary Leakage, LLpri μH 5.00 4.81 4.99\nSecondary Inductance, Lsec μH 915.29 754.71 765.00\nPrimary Resistance, Rpri Ω 0.96 0.95 0.95\nCoupling Coefficient, k - 0.861 0.844 0.842\nNumber of Tape Layers, L - 31 31 31\nNumber of Gaps, NG -68 1 0\nNumber of Windings, NW - 1 21 21 2\n 30\nfor the two designs.  Note that the only difference in the designs relates to the \nnumber of endcap layers used in the buil d, which is equal to the difference \nbetween the number of tape layers (L) and number of windings (NW).  The design \nwith additional endcaps (panel 2149 Y) possessed both higher coupling and \nhigher inductance.   \n \nTable 5: Build and parameter data for the D50E transformers used to study the impact of \nendcap structure on performance. \n \n \nFigure 18 shows the output voltage performance for both designs as a function of \nprimary current, and Figure 19 provides output voltage versus voltage switch \nstress for both designs.  The design with additional endcap layers displays higher \noutput voltage for a given current, and also provides a more linear relationship \nbetween output voltage and switch voltag e stress.  For the design with fewer \nendcap layers (2144Y), the output voltage versus switch voltage stress shows a \nsimilar slope at lower output voltages , but possesses a lower slope at higher \nvoltage levels.  This bend in the curve sugg ests a change to one or more of the \nvariables contained in Equation (8), in particular the effective turns ratio and the \nprimary leakage inductance.  This could result from an earlier onset of saturation \nfor the design with fewer endcaps. \n \n \nParameter Units 2149Y 2144Y\nPrimary Inductance, Lpri μH 37.22 31.80\nPrimary Leakage, LLpri μH 7.95 8.00\nSecondary Inductance, Lsec μH 1820.00 1530.00\nPrimary Resistance, Rpri Ω1 . 3 9 1 . 4 7\nCoupling Coefficient, k - 0.887 0.865\nNumber of Gaps, NG -1 2 1 2\nNumber of Windings, NW -1 6 1 6\nNumber of Layers, L 39 35\n 31\nFigure 18: Output voltage versus peak primary current for the D50E transformer designs \nsummarized in Table 5. \nFigure 19: Output voltage versus peak voltage across the MOSFET drain and source for \nthe D50E transformer designs summarized in Table 5. \n \n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n1.6\n1.7\n1.8\n1.9\n2\n2.1\n00 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 811 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 822 . 2 2 . 4\nPeak Input Current (A)\nOutput Voltage (kVDC)\n2144YE12\n2144YE13\n2144YE23\n2144YE32\n2149YE10\n2149YE12\n2149YE13\n2149YE18\n2149YE32\n2149YE42\n2149Y 2144Y\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n1.6\n1.7\n1.8\n1.9\n2\n2.1\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 450\nVdss Voltage(V)\nOutput Voltage (kV)\n2144YE12\n2144YE13\n2144YE23\n2144YE32\n2144YE33\n2144YE42\n2149YE10\n2149YE12\n2149YE13\n2149YE18\n2149YE23\n2149YE32\n2149YE33\n2149YE42\n 32\nTo better understand the observed differences, finite element modeling was \nutilized to investigate the dynamic saturation behavior of the D50E transformer.  \nFigure 20 shows a series of contour plots for the 2144Y transformer design with \nincreasing primary current (note the sca le has been adjusted to better illustrate \nregions of saturation).  At 1.1 Amps, the model shows that the region of the \nendcap layers adjacent to the center core area possesses the highest \nmagnetization level and is nearing saturation (note that the ferrite possesses a \nsaturation magnetization of approximately 3200 Gauss, or 0.32 Tesla).  When \nthe current increases to 1.25 Amps the endcap regions located next to the center \ncore become saturated.  This onset of saturation between 1.1 and 1.25 Amps \nagrees well with the observed bend in Figur e 19.  With the endcap region next to \nthe center core area saturated, more of the flux diverts through the secondary \nwindings region located inside the primary winding.  As a result, the endcap \nregions adjacent to the primary winding become more magnetized as the primary \ncurrent continues to increase, and at 1.5 Amps the endcap regions above and \nbelow the primary become saturated.  The level of saturation worsens for any \nfurther increase in the primary current.   \n \nThe occurrence of saturation in the narrow endcap layers results in a soft \nsaturation characteristic comparable to that observed with iron powder core \nmaterials.  Consequently, although the output performance degrades the \ntransformer continues to provide higher output voltage with increasing current.  \nThis soft saturation characteristic explains the different results shown in Figure \n19.  The 2149Y parts, which possess a higher number of endcap layers, do not \nshow evidence of saturation in Figure 19.    If the 2149Y parts were operated at \nincreasing currents beyond those shown, their output voltage versus switch \nvoltage stress would likely bend  similar to 2144Y.  Finally, note that the ratio of \nendcap layer thickness to center core radius determines whether saturation in \nthe endcap layers limits performances.  Fo r example, as shown in Figure 21, the \nD48B design saturates in the center core area and not the endcap regions due to \nits small core radius. \n 33\n \n \nFigure 20: FEMM contour plots for the 2144Y D50E transformer design summarized in \nTable 5, at different magnetizing currents.

This design \nsaturates in the center core area and not in the endcap regions. \n \nImpact of Gap Location on Coupling \nThe D47 transformer design, with all secondary windings located inside the \nprimary winding, possesses very poor coupling (refer to Table 2).  As discussed \npreviously, the poor coupling results becau se the D47 transformer center core \nregion possesses a net reluctance comparable to the reluctance of the magnetic \npath passing through the seco ndary windings region.  As a result the flux shows \nlittle preference to traverse through the center core region instead of the windings \nregion.  Removing the gaps from the center core region significantly improves the \ncoupling, providing a coupling coefficient k as high as 0.93 in D47 units built \nwithout any center core gaps.  However, these designs provide poor output \nperformance due to saturation at low primary currents.   \n \nThe introduction of the low permeability gaps  into the center core region for the \nD47 design negatively impacts coupling performance.  One simple way to \novercome this effect while still prov iding a high saturation magnetizing current \ninvolves placing the low perme ability dielectric gaps al ong the edge of the part \n(i.e. in the edge margin), instead of in the center core.  This keeps the reluctance \nof the center core region low compared to the secondary windings region, while \nkeeping the net transformer reluctance lar ge enough to avoid saturation at low \n\n 35\nmagnetizing currents.  Figure 22 shows an image comparing two D47 designs \nwith these different approaches to “gapping” the part.  Based on the models, the \nD47 design with the gaps in the center core region possesses a coupling \ncoefficient equal to 0.746 (which agrees well with the results in Table 2); whereas \nthe part containing gaps along the edge possesses a coupling coefficient of \n0.923.  Inserting the dielectric gaps on the edge of the parts provides a method \nfor significantly improving coupling of this LTCC transformer design.  Note that \nthis approach provides little impact on the interleaved D48B and D50E designs \nsince these designs have secondary windings located outside the primary \nwindings.  Additionally, it should be m entioned that the location of the low \npermeability gaps in the edge margin will creat e flux external to the transformer \nalong the edge of the part.  This might limit its use in circuits with a high \nsensitivity to electromagnetic interference. \n \nFigure 22: FEMM contour plots showing a comparison of the D47 design with center gaps \n(top) and edge gaps (bottom).  Both images are at 2 Amps primary current. \n \n\n 36\nEffect of Microstructure on Insulation Properties \nFor transformers that generate high output voltages the primary-secondary \ninsulation properties are critical.  In or der to achieve good ins ulation in the LTCC \ntransformer, a void-free monolithic structure is desirable as well as co-fired ferrite \nand dielectric materials with excellent die lectric standoff capability.  Achieving a \nvoid-free monolithic structure requires highly compatible materials, closely \nmatched sintering shrinkage and shrinkage rates between materials, and a well \ncharacterized and controlled sintering profile.  Dielectric standoff testing on \ntransformers from separate lots built using separate batches of material showed \na large variation of the primary-secondary breakdown properties.  To better \nunderstand these differences the samples were cross-sectioned, polished and \nimaged using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for analysis.   \n \nFigure 23 shows SEM images for a cro ss sectioned part from panel 1999Y, a \nD47 design with an average primary-seco ndary dielectric standoff of 3700 VAC \nrms (note that all dielectric standoff testing used a ramp rate of 500 VAC rms per \nsecond).  In the image the bright regions correspond to the primary and \nsecondary windings; the gray regions repr esent the ferrite and dielectric \nmaterials; and the regions of porosity are dark in contrast.  The thin dielectric \nlayers printed over the windings are barely visible in the images.  Figure 24 \nshows a higher magnification image of the region between the primary and \nsecondary windings (left image), as well as an image of a ferrite region removed \nfrom the windings region (right image).   As shown in Figures 23 and 24, the \nscale of the porosity in the dielectric between the primary and secondary \nwindings appears comparable to the porosity in the ferrite regions.  This suggests \nthe dielectric and ferrite materials possessed a reasonably matched sintering \nshrinkage/rate, which helps produce a mon olithic structure. However, compared \nto the solid, monolithic structure that surrounds the (central) transformer region, \nthere is visibly more porosity between the tape layers within the transformer edge \nmargin region (Figure 23).  This porosity in dicates that there are some materials \nand or processing incompatibilities in the system that could possibly be \n 37\noptimized. Nonetheless, the high dielectric standoff voltage for these parts \nindicates that small pores isolated between dense regions may be tolerable.  \n \nFigure 23: SEM images of cross-sectioned D47 transformers from panel 1999Y at low \nmagnification (left) and high magnification (right).  This panel of parts had a high dielectric \nstandoff between primary and secondary windings.   \n \n \nFigure 24: SEM images of a D47 transformer from panel 1999Y at very high magnification.  \nThe image on the left was taken in the low-permeability dielectric region between the \nprimary and secondary windings.  The image on the right was taken in a ferrite region \naway from the dielectric and conductor materials.  The two images show a comparable \nlevel of porosity, suggesting the sintering behavior of the dielectric and ferrite materials \nare reasonably matched. \n \n \n \nFigure 25 shows SEM cross section images from panel 2164Y, which used a \ndifferent batch of dielectric material fo r its build.  These transformers possessed \na much lower breakdown voltage of 2100 VAC rms between the primary and \nsecondary.   The cross sections showed large voids present between the primary \n\n 38\nand secondary windings, which undoubtedly contributed to the reduced dielectric \nstandoff of these parts.  These large voids may result from gas buildup in the part \nduring the organic binder removal process; from stresses created due to a \nmismatch in shrinkage or the rate of shrinkage between the dielectric and ferrite \nmaterials; or from stresses created during the lamination process.  In addition, \nthe dielectric layer possessed a much higher level of porosity than the ferrite \n(refer to Figure 26).  This also suggests a shrinkage mismatch between the \ndielectric and ferrite materials used for this panel, which likely resulted in poor \ndensification of the low permeability dielectric material.  The images shown in \nFigures 23 through 26 illustrate the importance of the material shrinkage and \nsintering characteristics on the final transformer microstructure and its impact on \nthe dielectric standoff properties of the sintered device. \n \n \nFigure 25: SEM images of cross-sectioned D47 transformers from panel 2164Y at low \nmagnification (left) and high magnification (right).  This panel of parts had a much lower \ndielectric standoff between primary and secondary windings relative to panel 1999Y.  The \nimages show a large void between primary and secondary windings that likely contributed \nto the reduced dielectric strength of this panel. \n \n \n\n 39\nFigure 26: SEM images of a D47 transformer from panel 2164Y at very high magnification.  \nThe image on the left was taken in the low-permeability dielectric region between the \nprimary and secondary windings.  The image on the right was taken in a ferrite region \naway from the dielectric and conductor materials.  The two images show markedly \ndifferent levels of porosity, suggesting the dielectric and ferrite materials possessed a \npoorly matched shrinkage rate when sintered. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nThis paper discussed the application of LTCC transformers for generating high \nvoltages using a flyback converter t opology.  The LTCC transformers possess a \nmonolithic structure with the coils surrounded by ferrite material, which in general \nleads to poor coupling for these designs .  Despite the relatively poor coupling, \nmultiple transformer designs achieved output voltages in excess of 2 kV.  Several \nmethods for improving the coupling in these devices were identified, which \nincludes interleaving the primary, locating the gaps on the edge instead of the \ncenter of the part, increasing the number of winding layers in the design, and \nincreasing the number of endcap layers when saturation in the endcap layers \nlimits performance.  Finally, analysis of  cross sectioned transformers highlighted \nprimary-secondary dielectreic standoff issues that result when the lamination and \nsintering operations produce a poor microstru cture.  Overall, these devices look \npromising for applications that need to c onvert a low input voltage to output \nvoltages up to several kilovolts. \n \n\n 40\nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to thank Kevin Ewsuk and Jill Glass for their help \nanalyzing the transformer microstructure, and for providing the SEM images of \nthe transformer cross sections. \n \nReferences \n[1] Chenetz, Steve, “Photoflash High-Voltage Power Supply”, Micrel Application \nNote 20 (http://www.micrel.com/_PDF/App-Notes/an-20.pdf). \n[2] Quinn, C.; Rinne, K.; O'Donnell, T.; Duffy, M.; Mathuna, C.O., “A Review of \nPlanar Magnetic Techniques and Techno logies”, Sixteenth Annual IEEE Applied \nPower Electronics Conference and Exposition, 2001 (APEC 2001), Volume 2,  4-\n8 March 2001 Page(s):1175 - 1183 vol.2. \n[3] Waffenschmidt, E., “Design and application of thin, planar magnetic \ncomponents for embedded passives integrated circuits”, 2004 IEEE 35th Annual \nPower Electronics Specialists Conference,  2004.
