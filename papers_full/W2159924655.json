  "abstract": "This paper presents an analysis of a very high efficiency topology based on a multiphase converter where the coupling among the phases is done by means of transformers. Since energy is not stored in the transformers, it is transferred directly from the input to the output. This topology along with its control strategy, were previously reported in state of the art. Some advantages of the proposed concept are that, thanks to the minimum storage of energy, the transfer rate of the energy is decoupled from switching frequency and can be chosen in order to increase efficiency. The regulation capability of this topology is limited and the topology acts as a DC-DC transformer. In this paper, the proposed topology is analyzed in detail and design guidelines are presented in order to optimize the design of the converter. These guidelines are applied to a specific design in order to build an optimized prototype.",
