    "abstract": "Public’s rational flood mitigation behaviors depend on accurate perception of flood risks. The use of natural language for flood risk perception is an effective approach, and it is critical to ensure the accuracy and comprehensibility of the flood information provided by the system in natural language dialogues. This study presents a framework for large language model (LLM) that is constrained by flood knowledge and can interact with geographic information system (GIS), aimed at enhancing the public’s perception of flood risks. We tested the performance of LLM within this framework and the results demonstrate that LLM can generate accurate information about floods under the constraints of entities and relationships in the knowledge graph, and interact with GIS to produce personalized knowledge through real-time coding. Furthermore, we conducted flood risk perception experiments on users with different cognitive levels. The results indicate that using natural language dialogue can narrow the differences brought about by cognitive levels, allowing the public to equally access knowledge related to flood events.",
