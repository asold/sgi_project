Moreover, several examples were showcased that \nSyntaLinker can be useful tools for carrying out drug design tasks such as fragment  linking, lead \noptimization and scaffold hopping.  \nIntroduction \nOver the past two decades, the fast development of gene sequencing technologies, together with high-\nthroughput screening1 (HTS) and combinatorial chemistry2 for library synthesis have largely changed \nthe drug discovery paradigm from a phenotypic centric approach to a target centric approach.3-4 Lead \nidentification by screening larg e compound collection has become standard exercise among large \npharmaceutical companies.5 Albeit its success in drug discovery, the high cost for maintaining the large \ncompound collection and launching a screening campaign is a big hurdle for drug develope rs in \nacademics and small biotech companies.6 Also, there are many factors influencing the quality of HTS \nhits such as technology hitter, sample purity, and sample aggregation etc.7-8  \nIn recent years fragment-based drug design (FBDD) has gained considerable attention as an alternative \ndrug discovery strategy due to its relatively low cost in running the assay and potential advantages in \nidentifying hits for difficult targets.9-11 The concept of FBDD can date back to the pioneering work of \nWilliam Jencks in mid-1990s.12 It usually starts from screening low molecular weight molecules which \nhave weak, but efficient interactions with a target  protein (for example, MW<300  Daltons; binding \naffinity of the order of mM).13 The fragment screening is usually carried out at high concentration and \na typical fragment collection is around a few tho usands of co mpound in contrast to millions of \ncompound in HTS which are routinely run in “Big Pharma”.14 The effective use of fragments as starting \npoints for step-wise optimizations has  shown capability to overcome the major  obstacles for further \ndrug development, such as limited chemical space, low structural  diversity, and unfavorable drug \nabsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties. 15 Therefore, the \npopularity of fragment-based drug design has grown at a remarkable rate in both industry and academic \ninstitutions.16 \nIn practice, there are still two key factors for successfully utilizing FBDD in drug discovery: (i) identify \nsuitable fragments (ii) grow and optimize these fragments to develop drug -like molecules. Actually, \nfinding desirable fragments is relatively straightforward. Many experimental and computational efforts \nhave accelerated the identification process in the past decade17, including nuclear magnetic resonance \n(NMR), X -ray c rystallography, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)  and virtual  screening18. After \nobtaining the initial fragment hits, the next key step is to expand these fragments into molecules with \nlarger size for lead o ptimization. Fragment growing, merging, and linking are three main strategies \ncommonly used by medicinal  chemists.19,20 Although there are some fragment linking examples \nreported in literature 21-22, unlike the other two popular strategies, fragment linking is generally \nregarded as a challenging task due to the stringent requirements on keeping original binding modes for \nfragment moieties after linking. Mismatch of length or geometry in the linker can have a dramatically \nnegative effect on binding of full compound. Nevertheless, fragment linking is still attractive because \nof the promise of additive binding potency (an improvement in ligand efficiency (LE) rather than mere \nmaintenance of LE).23-25  \nHow to identify a linker featuring an optimal fit has stimulated research enthusiasm among drug \ndevelopers. Traditional computational tools for fragment linking are mainly two types 26: (i) database \nsearch27-28, (ii) quantum mechanical (QM) calculation (such as fragment molecular orbital (FMO)).29-\n31 However, these methods have been significantly limited by the size of database or complex \ncomputations. \nRecently, advances in the development of deep generative models have spawned a mass of promising \nmethods to address  the structure generation issue in drug design. 32-34 The applications of deep \ngenerative models in pharmaceutical research has cov ered de novo molecular design35-38, molecular \noptimization39-41. Various generative architectures including RNNs42, autoencoders43-44, and generative \nadversarial networks 45 (GANs) have been proven to be effective data -driven methods for creating \ndesirable molecules, which are either represented by simplified  molecular input line entry \nspecification46 (SMILES) or molecular graph.  Recently, a fragment linking methodology based on \ngenerative model has been reported by Fergus Imrie and co-workers.47 They put forward a molecule \ngraph based de ep generative model (DeLinker), which ca n join fragments through restraining their \nrelative positions. In their method the relative pos ition between the starting fragments is merely \nrepresented by the distance and angle between the two bonds in the vicinit y of the linker sites. This \nmodel requires pre-generated three dimensional conformations of a molecule for selecting training set \ncompounds, and the algorithm to seek the biologically active conformation48 could be computationally \nexpensive and challenging. \nHerein, we developed a novel fragment linking methodology, SyntaLinker, to link fragments \nefficiently and rapidly based on a SMILES based generative model  and the 2D bond distance among \nlinked fragments can be added as a constraint for linker ge neration. Inspired by machine translation \ntask in natural language processing (NLP), the transformer architecture 49 has recently been \nsuccessfully used for reaction prediction and retrosynthesis planning. 50-52 Motivated by these \napplications, we regard the fragment linking as a common task, called sentence completion53, in NLP, \nand develop a novel  conditional transformer architecture ( SyntaLinker) for linker generation in a \ncontrollable manner. In current study, ChEMBL compounds were broken down into terminal fragment \nand linker components and transformer models were trained to learn the compound synthetic grammar \nand generate linker without relying on any predefined rigid transformation rules. \nOur model takes terminal fragments and linker constraints, such as the shortest linker bond distance \n(SLBD), the existence of the h ydrogen bond donor, hydrogen bond acceptor, rotatable bond and ring \netc., as inputs and generate product compounds containing input fragments. Compared to DeLinker, \nour approach achieved higher recover rate in terms of rational linker prediction. Finally, through a few \ncase study examples, we also demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on some common drug \ndesign tasks such as fragment linking, lead optimization and scaffold hopping. \n \nMethods \nTask Definition. Our goal is to generate a drug -like molec ule by connecting two given starting \nfragments under specified constraints of the linker as shown in Figure 1. There are two types of linker \nconstraints used as control codes during training. One is the SLBD between two linker sites, which is \nused to maint ain relative position of two starting fragments.  The other one is the constraint with \nmultiple features, besid es the SLBD, including also the presence of hydrogen bond donor (HBD), \nhydrogen bond receptor (HBA), rotatable bond (RB) and ring, which can be re garded as additional \npharmacophoric constraints. \nThis process can be regarded as an end -to-end sentence comple tion process, w here the starting \nfragments is the input signal and the full compound is the output signal. Swaller et al 50 used encoder-\ndecoder neutral network architecture to predict reaction product in an end -to-end manner, where the \nreactants serve as source sequence and reaction product as t arget sequence. Whereas in our case , the \ntwo starting fragments and constraints of the SLBD (as prepended toke n) are defined as the source \nsequence, and the full molecule as target sequence. Examples of the sequence expression are shown in \nFigure 1. A trai ning example with SLBD as constraint is described as \n“[L_4]c1ccccc1[*].[*]C1CCOCC1>>c1ccc(CNCC2CCOCC2)cc1”, wh ere \n“[L_4]c1ccccc1[*].[*]C1CCOCC1” is the source sequence, “c1ccc(CNCC2CCOCC2)cc1” is the \ntarget sequence, and “[L_4]” is the SLBD (equal to four bond distance) as the control code. In the \nother example, “[L_4 1 1 1 0]” represents the multiple constraints, where the “1 1 1 0” represents the \npresence of HBD, HBA, RB and the absence of ring. \n \nFigure 1. An example of the source sequence and target sequence SMILES with different constraints. \nModel Architecture. A novel conditional transformer model ( SyntaLinker), based on transformer \narchitecture, was proposed for generating structures with the customized conditions. Compared to the \noriginal transformer  model49, SyntaLinker (shown in Figure 2)  introduces a variety of prepended \ncontrol codes54-55 to ensure generated molecules to satisfy explicit criterion. \n\n \nFigure 2.  Basic a rchitecture of the controllable transformer model ( SyntaLinker). In the input \nembedding layer, we embed each fragment pairs with SLBD constraints (C 1) or multiple constraints \n(C2). \nAll source and target sequences of our data set were first tokenized to construct a vocabulary. For each \nsingle example sequence containing n tokens, it was first encoded into a one -hot matrix by the \nvocabulary and then transformed into a embedding matrix  Ms = (e1, ..., e n) by a word embedding \nalgorithm56 following our previous work57. Ms was composed of n corresponding vectors in Rd, where \nd is embedding dimension. \nThe core architecture of SyntaLinker contains multiple encoder -decoder stacks.  The encoder and \ndecoder consist of six identical layers, respectively. Each encoder layer has a multihead self-attention \nsub-layer and a position-wise feedforward network (FFN) sub-layer. A multihead attention consists of \n\nseveral scaled dot -product attention functions runnin g in parallel and concatenate their outputs into \nfinal values, wh ich allows the model to focus on information from different subspaces at different \npositions. An attention mechanism computes the dot products of the query ( Q) with all keys ( K), \nintroduces a scaling factor dk (equal to the size of weight matrices) to avoid excessive dot products, \nand then apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values (V). Formally \n𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑄𝐾𝑇\n√𝑑𝑘\n) 𝑉        (1) \nThe FFN sub -layer adopt ReLU activation.58 Then, layer normalization 59-60, and a residual \nconnection61 introduced to integrate above two core sub -layers. Each decoder layer has three s ub-\nlayers, including two attention sub -layer and an FFN sub -layer. The decoder self-attention sub-layer \nuses a mask to preclude attending to future tokens. While the encoder-decoder attention sub-layer helps \nthe decoder to focus on important prats in the s ource sequence, and capture the relationship between \nthe encoder and decoder. \nFor a given source sequence, its input embedding was processed by encoder layers into a latent \nrepresentation L = (l1, ..., ln). Given L, the decoder output was normalized with a softmax, yielding a \nprobability distribution for sampling a token, and then generated an output sequence Y = (y1, ..., ym) of \none token at a time until the ending token “⟨/s⟩” was generated. Finally, model calculate and minimize \nthe cross-entropy loss between the target sequence Mt = (e1, ..., ek) and the output sequence Y during \ntraining. \nℒ(𝑌, 𝑀) = − ∑ 𝑦𝑖 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑚𝑖\n𝑘\n𝑖=1\n        (2) \nData set preparation. Our data set were derived from the ChEMBL 62 database and preprocessed in \nthe same way as in previous study35. After the preprocessing, remaining molecules were further filtered \nthrough Lipinski’s “Rules of Five” 63, pan assay interference compounds 7 (PAINS) substructures and \nsynthetic accessibili ty s core64 (SAscore, the cut -off value set to 6.5) to make sure the generated \nmolecules are drug-like and likely to be synthesizable. In the end 718,652 unique molecules were kept \nfor further processing.  \nTo mimic the fragment linking scenario, we constructed our data set using matched molecular pairs \n(MMPs) cutting algorithm65 proposed by Hussain et al. Firstly, each molecule was deconstructed using \nMMPs cutting algorithm, which executed double cuts of non-functional group, acyclic single bonds in \nevery compound and this will transform the compound into a quadruple form like “fragment1, linker, \nfragment2, molecule”, which corresponds to two terminal fragments, a linker and the original \ncompound. In total 5,873,503 fragment molecule quadruples (FMQ) were enumerated; Secondly, the \nFMQs were further filtered using “Rule of three” 66 criteria, i.e. a FMQ will be removed if any of its \nterminal fragment violate the “Rule of three” criteria; Lastly, considering  that the requirement of \nlinking fragments in reality is to connect two close fragments using linker as simple as possible, the \nremaining FMQs were then filtered by SLBD of linker (SLBD less than 15) and SAscore according to \nEquation 1 to ensure the terminal fragments have reasonable synthesis feasibility (SAscore is less than \n5) and SAscore of linker is lower than the sum of fragments. \n𝑆𝐴𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒_𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟 =  {\n𝑆𝐴𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡1 < 5                                                                   \n𝑆𝐴𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡2 < 5                                                                   \n𝑆𝐴𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑒𝑟 < (𝑆𝐴𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡1 + 𝑆𝐴𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡2)\n        (3) \nIn the end, 784,728 FMQs were obtained. Only terminal fragments and original compounds were kept \nas fragment molecule triplet (FMT) for model training and all chemical structures in the FMTs were \ntranslated to canonicalized SMILES format46, 67 with RDKit68.  \nOur ChEMBL data set were further divided into three sets with a ratio of 8:1:1 for training, validating, \nand testing, respectively. All FMTs were grouped by corresponding SLBD.  When splitting the \nChEMBL set into those three sets, a random samp ling strategy wa s adopted to make sure the \ndistribution of SLBD is similar among all three sets. \nIn addition, for further evaluating the generalization capability of our model, we also considered an \nexternal validation set derived from CASF -2016 data set 69, which consists of 285 protein -ligand \ncomplexes with high-quality crystal structures. The same data set was also employed by Imrie et al. \nfor their work on DeLinker. \nLastly, our SyntaLinker method was applied on three case study examples from literature, which were \nalso reported by Imrie et al, to demonstrate the capability of the model for doing fragment linking, lead \noptimization, and scaffold hopping . It is worthwhil e to mention that the ground truth compounds in \nthese examples were not included in the training set of our SyntaLinker models. \n \nEvaluation metrics for SyntaLinker model. The ultimate goal of our model is to generate various \nmolecules, containing two startin g fragments. Therefore, four different metrics on 2D level, validity, \nuniqueness, recovery and novelty, were employed to compare generated molecules and their ground \ntruth in test set. 70-71 Here, validity refers to  the percentage of  generated chemically valid molecules \nwith two starting fragments; Novelty is the percentage of  generated chemically valid molecules with \nnovel linkers (not present in the training set); Uniqueness is the number of unique structures generated \nand recovery means the percentage of ground truth is generated among test set compounds. Formally, \n \n𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑦 = # 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑦 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 𝑆𝑀𝐼𝐿𝐸𝑆 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠\n# 𝑜𝑓 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑆𝑀𝐼𝐿𝐸𝑆         (4) \n \n𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 = # 𝑜𝑓 𝑛𝑜𝑛 − 𝑑𝑢𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒, 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠 \n# 𝑜𝑓 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠         (5) \n \n𝑁𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑦 = # 𝑜𝑓 𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑙 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑠𝑒𝑡\n# 𝑜𝑓 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑒 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠         (6) \nTo mimic the FBDD scenario, the quality of compounds generated by SyntaLinker model at 3D level \nwas also examined. In this case, the 3D conformations of compound are generated and docked into \nprotein binding pocket, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and shape and color combo-similarity \nscore (SC) to the X -ray bound co nformation of actual ligand a re generated to evaluate model \nperformance for selected cases. Here, RMSD is merely calculated among the two starting fragments \nof the X -ray and generated structures.  The SC score is calculated by the pharmacophoric feature \nsimilarity72 and the shape similarity73 between the X-ray conformation of actual ligand and the docking \npose of generated structure. The SC score is a float value in the range of [0,1] and the higher value is, \nthe more similar the generated molecule is to the original ligand. For each molecule, the best similarity \nscore among all docking conformers was taken as the SC score. In current study, converting SMILES \nto 3D conformation and docking were done by using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) \nsoftware74. The RMSD and SC score for each conformation were calculated via RDkit68. \nModel Training and Optimization of Hyperparameters. The SyntaLinker model was implemented \nusing OpenNMT.75 All scripts were written in Python76 (version 3.7). We trained our models on GPU \n(Nvidia 2080Ti), and saved checkpoint per 1000 steps. The best hyperparameters were obtained based \non the recovery metric of the ChE MBL validation set. We bui lt our model with the best \nhyperparameters (shown in Table S1) and adopted the beam search procedure 77 to generate multiple \ncandidates with a special beam width. All generated candidates were canonicalized using RDkit and \ncompared to the ground-truth molecules. \n \nResults and Discussion \nAs mentioned in the above section, we trained models with two different constraints, i.e. SLBD only \nand SLBD plus pharmacophore constraints and named models as SyntaLinker and SyntaLinker_multi \nrespectively. Additionally, a reference model without using any constraints, SyntaLinker_n, was also \ntrained for comparison. The performance of our models on ChEMBL test set and CASF validation set \nwas examined. \nModel Performance on ChEMBL Test Set. We first assessed the performance of models on \nChEMBL test set using 2D metrics. Top 10 candidates for each p air of starting fragments were \ngenerated. The performance is demonstrated in Table 1. All models achieved over 95% validity, 90% \nlinker novelty and recovered over 80% of the original molecules, demonstrating that the conditional \ntransformer model can learn to identify the linker part of the structures, generate the linker accordingly, \nand also the models are generalized well enough to create new linkers. It seems that the constraint \nmodels are better than the model without using constraint in terms of recov ery, novelty and validity. \nEspecially, the most detailed constraints model SyntaLinker_multi achieves a recovery rate of 87.1% \nin the top10 recommendations. This is probably due to the fact that more prior knowledge about the \nlinker are defined in the multiple constraints model than others. \n Table 1. Performance comparison of models with different constraints on ChEMBL test set. \nMetrics \nModels \nSyntaLinker SyntaLinker_multi SyntaLinker_n \nValidity 97.2% 97.8% 96.0% \nUniqueness 88.1% 84.9% 86.7% \nRecovery 84.7% 87.1% 80.0% \nNovelty 91.8% 92.3% 90.3% \nModel Performanc e on CASF. To compare with the DeLinker model (downloaded  at \nhttps://github.com/oxpig/DeLinker), we further evaluated the models on the external validation set \nCASF-201669 which was  used in the DeLinker model. Following the same sampling strategy as \nDeLinker, we generated 250 molecules for each pair of starting fragments. The detailed performance \nof various models on the same validation set is demonstrated in Table 2.  \nTable 2. Performance comparison of models on the CASF-2016 validation set. \nMetrics \nModels \nDeLinker SyntaLinker SyntaLinker_multi SyntaLinker_n \nValidity 95.5% 96.4% 96.5% 86.8% \nUniqueness 51.9% 69.9% 63.8% 65.6% \nRecovery 53.7% 62.7% 60.2% 55.4% \nNovelty 51.0% 75.4% 77.2% 71.3% \n \nThese metrics indicate that the performance of our models is significantly improved over the DeLinker \nmodel on CASF validation set. Especially, our model improves the linker novelty of DeLinker model \nby a margin of 20% without losing the recovery, which means our model can sample a diverse range \nof linkers effectively. \nEfficiency of Controlling Structure Generation. The aim of building constrained transformer model \nis to make sure generated structures can fulfill certain  criteria. We further calculated the SLBD and \npharmacophore properties of linkers in the generated molecules to evaluated whether these constraints \nachieved desirable control or not. The original linker bond length and pharmacophore properties of \ncompounds in test sets were set as the control criterion when generating structures using constrained \nmodel SyntaLinker and SyntaLinker_multi, respectively, while for unconstrained model \nSyntaLinker_n, no control criterion was used. For structures generated by all thr ee models, the linker \nlength and pharmacophore properties were examined to compare the efficiency in controlling structure \ngeneration. Besides evaluating the control efficiency on ChEMBL test set and CASF validation set, \nthe effect of beam search width (to p 10 and top 250) wa s also assessed. The percentage of structures \nwith correct shortest length of linker and structures whose linker length variation is less than one bond \ndistance from all three SyntaLinker models on ChEMBL test set in top10 and top 250 ar e shown in \nFigure 3 a and Figure 3b. As expected, the model with length constraints ( SyntaLinker, \nSyntaLinker_multi) outperform the model without constraints (SyntaLinker_n), where 79.2%, 78.1% \nand 39.9% of structures have exact same linker length as the contr ol for SyntaLinker, \nSyntaLinker_multi and SyntaLinker_n models respectively. If the allowed variation of link bond length \nis expanded to no more than one bond, the percentage of structures fulfilling the criteria from three \nmodels are 96.1%, 96.2% and 69% respectively. For CASF validation set, the same trend was observed \nin Figure 3c. It is worthwhile to point out that when we increase the beam search width from 10 to 250, \nthe control efficiency of shortest bond length for all three models decrease as shown in Figure 3b and \nFigure 3d. But the advantage of constrained model versus unconstrained model is still obvious. \n \nFigure 3. The comparison of efficiency in controlling SLBD for three SyntaLinker models. (a) The \npercentage of compound among top 10 solutions (b eam search w idth of 10) fulfilling bond length \ncriteria in ChEMBL test set; (b) The percentage of compound among top 250 solutions fulfilling bond \nlength criteria in ChEMBL test set; (c) The percentage of compound among top 10 solutions fulfilling \nbond length criteria in CASF set; (d) The percentage of compound among top 250 solutions fulfilling \nbond length criteria in CASF set. \nThe percentage of structures with exactly equivalent pharmacophore properties to their ground truth \nof linker from all three SyntaLinker models on ChEMBL test set in top10 and top 250 are shown in \nFigure 4. As expected, the model with pharmacophore constraints (SyntaLinker_multi) outperform the \nmodel without this constraint ( SyntaLinker, SyntaLinker_n), where 36.5%, 55.2% and 35.0% of \nstructures have exact same pharmacophore properties as the control for SyntaLinker, \nSyntaLinker_multi and SyntaLinker_n models on ChEMBL test set respectively. For CASF validation \nset, the same trend was also observed. Furthermore, when we increased the beam se arch width from \n10 to 250, the control efficiency of pharmacophore for all three models decreased. Due to the \ncombination of multiple constraints, the control efficiency of pharmacophore constraints is lower than \nthe control efficiency of bond length constraint (as shown in Figure 3), but in general the advantage of \n\nthe constrained model over the unconstrained model remains. \n \nFigure 5. The efficiency in controlling pharmacophore properties of linker for various models in \nChEMBL test set and CASF validation set with top10 and 250 solutions, the percentage of structures \nwith exactly the same pharmacophore pattern of linker in generated molecules are compared. \nProperties of the Generated Molecules. To evaluate the quality of generated compound from \nSyntaLinker models, Drug-likeness score (QED score), synthetic accessibility score (SAscore), the \ncalculated water-octanol partition coefficient (logP) and molecule weight (MW) calculated in RDkit \nwas used to characterize the quality of generated molecules. For each p air of starting fragments in \nChEMBL test set, the properties of its top 10 and top 250 candidates were calculated and averaged to \nobtain a final value. A comparison with the properties of the original ChEMBL data (Figure 5) showed \nthat molecules generated from various SyntaLinker models clearly have higher QED and lower \nSAscore than ChEMBL compounds and difference among various SyntaLinker models is quite small, \nwhile the distribution of logP and MW are similar among ChEMBL compounds and compounds \ngenerated by SyntaLinker models. It suggests that SyntaLinker generated compounds, at some extent, \n\nare more drug -like and have lower complexity for synthesis comparing with ChEMBL compounds. \nThis is probably due to the fact that the chosen starting fragment pairs restr aint the properties of \ngenerated structures. \n \nFigure 5. Distribution of chemical properties for ChEMBL set and generated molecules sets from \ndifferent models. \nFragment Linking Case. In Medicinal chemistry, fragment linking is generally considered as an \nattractive approach for providing a positive impact on increasing affinity.  Trapero et al. reported a \nsuccessful fragment linking example. 78 They identified a low a ffinity phenylimidazole derivative \n\nthrough virtual screening target IMPDH, and then linked these fragments to form a larger compound  \nwith a more than 1000 -fold boost in binding affinity. Inspired by their successful experiments, we \nemployed their low affin ity fragments (PDB ID: 5OU2) as our starting fragments and generated the \nlinked structure (PDB ID: 5OU3) through our model (as shown in Figure 6). \n \nFigure 6. Fragment linking case study. (a) The binding poses of the two starting fragments (PDB \n5OU2). (b) The bound conformation of the merged ligand in PDB 5OU3. (c) Chemical structure of \nstarting fragments and active target compound. \nGiven the starting fragments as in 5OU2, we set the SLBD between 3 to 5 and generated 500 candidates. \nThe ground truth target compound was successfully recovered and after 3D conformer generation and \ndocking, most of the generated structures actually have a better docking score than the target compound \n(Table 3). Three generated molecules with the highest 3D fragment similarity a nd favorable MOE \ndocking score are shown in Figure 7, where the docking pose of the recovered original lead by our \nSyntaLinker model is shown in Figure 7c. \n\nTable 3.

Overlay of the original conformer (PDB 5OU3, green carbons) and three generated \nmolecules (pink carbons, chemical structures shown in blue boxes) with the highest 3D fragment \nsimilarity and highly MOE docking score. \nLead Optimization Case. Lead optimization is a iterative process of continuously modifying lead \nstructures to improving potency and ADMET properties after initial lead compounds are identified. \nHere, we mimicked a typical lead optimization process via our SyntaLinker model. Dequalinium \n(Figure 8c) has an inhibitory effect of Chitinase A in the low nanomolar range ( Ki: 70 nM), which \nmakes it attractive for plausible development of therapeutics against human diseases involving \nchitinase-mediated pathologies.79 Previous studies have clearly demonstrated its binding mode (PDB \n\nID: 3ARP), and proven that the two fragments (Figure 8d) connected by a decane linker is critical, due \nto occupying the hydrophobic areas of the binding pocked.  \n \nFigure 8. Structure information of lead optimization case study.  (a) Surface representations of the \ncomplexes of the Chitinase A  and dequalinium (PDB ID: 3ARP). (b) The binding poses of the two \ncritical fragments in binding pocket. (c) Chemical structure of dequalinium. (d) Two critical fragments \nof dequalinium (mapped by blue shadow). \nFor optimizing the linker of dequalinium,  we first broke down its structure using MMPs cutting \nalgorithm and filtered generated fragments pairs as mentioned before, resulting 45 unique fragments \npairs. All these pairs were employed as starting fragments to generate 100 candidates using our \nSyntaLinker model. The original molecule dequalinium was constantly recovered in all trials, and after \nremoving redundant molecules, the RMSD of two critical fragments were calculated. Details are also \nshown in Table 3. \nIt seems that SyntaLinker model can generate a large number of novel molecules, where 179 and 30 \n\ncompounds whose RMSD of sta rting fragment are less than 2 and 1 Å respectively. While, the best \nRMSD in our hands of top the 5 compounds from DeLinker model is 2.5 Å. The most similar molecules \nin 3D to the lead compound are shown in Figure 9. Comparing with solutions found by DeLinker, our \nSyntaLinker model seems give chemically more reasonable compounds (three examples are shown in \nFigure 10) and also better RMSD and SC metrics. This may due to chemically more attractive linkers \nexisted in our ChEMBL training set and also the  ease of  learning a sequence generation model \ncomparing with the graph generation model. \n \nFigure 9.  Examples of Overlays (2D chemical structure shown in right) and the 3D metrics of \nconformers from generated structures. The reference Dequalinium conformer is shown in green, while \ndocked conformers of the generated molecule are shown in orange (DeLinker)  or pink (our \nSyntaLinker model). (a) Overlays of reference conformer with the best DeLinke r compound in terms \nof SC and RMSD score. (b) Overlays of reference conformer with the best SyntaLinker compound in \nterms of 3D metrics. \n\n \nFigure 10. Examples of generated molecules and their RMSD values. \nScaffold Hopping Case. As a commonly used drug design strategy, scaffold hopping is a methodology \nthat focuses explicitly on replacing central core of a template compound, while still keep more or less \nthe same level o f potency. Kamenecka et al. have reported an interesting study of scaffold hopping, \nwhich significantly improved selectivity toward its specific targets.80 In this study, they aimed to design \nJNK3-selective inhibitors that had more than 1000-fold selectivity over p38. Eventually, they obtained \naminopyrazole based inhibitors (PDB ID 3FI2) instead of the original indazole based inhibitors (PDB \nID 3FI3), and improved the selectivity to 2800 fold. These two scaffolds have nearly identical binding \nmodes to JNK3 (Figure 11). We start with the indazole class inhibitor, and aim to use our SyntaLinker \nmodel to reproduce this successful scaffold hopping process. We first set the SLBD range from 6 to 8, \nand 2500 molecules were generated. There were 2138 unique molecules. Among them, more than 1000 \nmolecules with a RMSD value less than 1 Å and SC value greater than 0.5. In total we identified 634 \nnovel linkers not included in the training set, covering 186 unique Murcko scaffolds 81. Among them, \nencouragingly, both indazole (Figure 12a) and aminopyrazole class linkers (Figure 12b) were \nrecovered. Additionally, some novel linker scaffolds were also identi fied. This result highlights that \nour SyntaLinker model is well generalized to  design novel linkers by combining the chemical \ninformation of starting fragments, not merely remembering the linkers in the ChEMBL training set. \nSeveral of examples are shown in  Figure 12. All scaffolds showed good overlap with the original \nindazole linker, while maintaining the conformation of starting fragments in the molecule. \n\n \nFigure 11. Scaffold hopping case study. (a) Overlay of the indazole (PDB 3FI3, green) and \naminopyrazole (PDB 3FI2, pink) structures. (b) Chemical structure and Murcko scaffold of the \nindazole (upper) and aminopyrazole (down) compounds. The highlighted part of compounds is set as \nthe starting fragments. \n \nFigure 12. Overlay of the indazole inhibitor (PDB 3FI3, green) and several example structures (yellow) \nwith high 3D s imilarity. The linker structures are shown (novel scaffolds colored by yellow, the \nrecovered ground truth scaffolds colored by green) in upper left, and the  order number (sorted by SC \nscore) are shown in bottom right. \n \nConclusion \nIn current study, we have proposed a novel deep generative model, SyntaLinker, for fragment linking. \nUnlike previous attempts in generating linkers with graph convolution neural network, our method is \n\ntrained purely at 2D level, and does not need to search 3D conformational databases and make complex \nconformation analysis. A novel conditional transformer neural network architecture was proposed to \ngenerate compounds by learning the linker structure information given  the starting fragment pairs. \nSimply setting the shortest bond distance of linker between the starting fragments as constraint, a large \nnumber of novel drug-like candidates satisfying the constraint can be obtained. We have demonstrated \nthat our generative model is able to learn and infer novel linkers that match the pre-defined constraints. \nIn addition, we also build models with multiple pharmacophore constraints for doing more specific \nlinker design. More importantly, through several case study examples, we have shown that our method \ncan be applied on fragment linking , lead optimization and scaffold hopping tasks. Most of the \ngenerated molecules have better docking score than the original hits, while maintaining similar binding \nmodes and possessing high 3D similarity to the bound conformation in X-ray structure. It is expected \nthat SyntaLinker can become a useful tool in fragment -based lead generation and scaffold hopping \nprocess. \n  \nReference \n1. Macarron, R.; Banks, M. N.; Bojanic, D.; Burns, D.
