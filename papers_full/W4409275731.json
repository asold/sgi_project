Traditional decision -making models, while useful, often \nstruggle to integrate and analyze such diverse data sets, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic \nenvironments. \nIn recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have been \nincreasingly employed to tackle these challenges. Among the various AI models, Large \nLanguage Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to process and \nunderstand both structured and unstructured data, such as numerical transaction records, \nsupplier communications, customer feedback, and market trends. LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-\n3 and GPT-4, have shown impressive capabilities in natural language processing, making them \nan ideal tool for handling complex, multi -dimensional datasets that are inherent in supply \nchain systems. \nThis research aims to explore the potential of LLMs in optimizing  supply chain decision -\nmaking. The study focuses on key areas such as demand forecasting, supplier selection, \ninventory management, and logistics optimization. It compares the performance of LLMs with \ntraditional machine learning models, including Random F orest (RF), Gradient Boosting \nMachines (GBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), to \nevaluate which approach provides the most efficient and accurate decision-making outcomes. \nBy leveraging both structured and unstructured data, this study intends to demonstrate that \nLLMs can significantly enhance supply chain processes and provide a competitive edge to \norganizations. \n \nLiterature Review \nThe concept of optimizing supply chain decision -making using AI and machine learning has \nbeen the focus of numerous studies in recent years. Early research in supply chain optimization \nlargely relied on classical operations research models such as linear programming, network \nflow analysis, and inventory models. These models, while effective for basic supply chain tasks, \noften struggled with the increasing complexity and dynamic nature of global supply chains \n(Simchi-Levi et al., 2003). \nWith the advent of machine learning and AI, researchers have turned to more advanced \nmethods to address these challenges. Machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), \nGradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been wide ly \nused for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and supplier selection. These models \nleverage large datasets, learning patterns from historical data to predict future trends and \noptimize decision-making. For example, Xie et al. (2020) used a hybrid model combining SVM \nand Genetic Algorithms to improve demand forecasting accuracy, while Shishika et al. (2018) \napplied RF models for supplier selection in a global supply chain context. \nHowever, the traditional machine learning approaches face limitation s when dealing with \nunstructured data, which often constitutes a significant portion of the data in modern supply \nchains. Unstructured data, such as emails, text reports, social media content, and customer \nfeedback, contains valuable insights that are diff icult for classical models to capture. Recent \nadvances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly with the development of Large \nLanguage Models (LLMs), have provided a powerful tool for addressing this challenge. LLMs \nlike GPT-3 have shown significant potential in understanding and generating human-like text, \nmaking them highly capable of analyzing unstructured data (Brown et al., 2020). \nSeveral studies have highlighted the potential of LLMs in supply chain management. For \ninstance, Nguyen et al. (2 021) explored the application of LLMs in demand forecasting, \nsuggesting that these models could better capture temporal patterns and external factors \ninfluencing demand than traditional machine learning algorithms. Similarly, research by Zhang \net al. (2022 ) demonstrated that LLMs can enhance supplier selection by analyzing historical \ncommunication and feedback data, leading to more informed decisions about supplier \nhttps://scientiamreearch.org/index.php/ijefms \n \n \nCOLOMBO SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING  \n \n12 \nreliability and quality. Additionally, the integration of LLMs with IoT data has shown promis e \nin logistics optimization, where the models can process real -time updates on weather, traffic \nconditions, and shipment statuses to improve delivery route planning (Huang et al., 2021). \nDespite the promising results from LLMs, some challenges remain. The computational \nresources required for training and deploying LLMs can be substantial, which may limit their \naccessibility for smaller organizations. Additionally, the integration of LLMs with traditional \nsupply chain systems, which often rely on structured data, requires careful data preprocessing \nand feature engineering to ensure compatibility and accuracy. \nIn conclusion, while traditional machine learning models have made significant strides in \noptimizing supply chain operations, LLMs offer a promising alt ernative by integrating both \nstructured and unstructured data sources. Their ability to process and understand natural \nlanguage, along with their superior predictive capabilities, positions them as a powerful tool \nfor enhancing supply chain decision -making. However, further research is needed to address \nthe challenges of resource -intensive computations and seamless integration with existing \nsupply chain frameworks. This study aims to contribute to this growing body of knowledge by \nevaluating the performance of LLMs in comparison to traditional models across various supply \nchain optimization tasks. \n \nMETHODOLOGY  \n \nDataset Collection \n \nThe foundation of optimizing supply chain decision -making using Large Language Models \n(LLMs) lies in the collection of a rich an d diverse dataset. The dataset must comprehensively \ncover a broad range of supply chain aspects, from procurement and inventory management to \ndemand forecasting, supplier performance, and logistics management. For this purpose, data \nis gathered from variou s sources, including transactional data from enterprise resource \nplanning (ERP) systems, customer order histories, supplier performance reports, production \nschedules, and IoT sensor data that provides real -time information on product movement, \nstock levels, and environmental conditions. In addition to structured data, unstructured data \nsuch as email communications, reports, contracts, and customer feedback plays a significant \nrole in providing insights into potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the sup ply chain \nprocess. \nThe structured data might include variables such as order volumes, stock levels, lead times, \nand pricing information, while unstructured data could contain insights about supplier \nrelationships, logistical challenges, or market sentiment . This data will be collected over an \nextended period, as supply chains are dynamic and require longitudinal data to understand \nseasonal trends, long -term shifts, and unexpected disruptions. Furthermore, external factors \nsuch as weather forecasts, geopolit ical events, and market fluctuations are also incorporated \ninto the dataset to enhance the model's prediction power. \n \nThe following table outlines the specific details of the dataset that will be used in this \nstudy:  \n \nDataset \nCategory \nDescription Data Source Frequency \nProcurement \nData \nInformation on raw material \npurchases, prices, and lead \ntimes. \nERP systems, supplier \ninvoices \nDaily/Monthly \nhttps://scientiamreearch.org/index.php/ijefms \n \n \nCOLOMBO SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING \n \n13 \nInventory \nData \nCurrent stock levels, stockouts, \nreplenishment data, and \ninventory turnover. \nWarehouse management  \nsystems, inventory reports \nReal-time/Daily \nDemand Data Historical demand data, \nforecasting data, and customer \norders. \nCustomer order \nmanagement systems, sales \nreports, demand forecasting \ntools \nDaily/Weekly \nLogistics \nData \nShipment tracking, delivery \ntimes, logistics costs, and \nrouting details. \nGPS tracking, transportation \nmanagement systems, \ndelivery logs \nReal-time/Weekly \nSupplier Data Supplier performance, on-time \ndelivery rates, quality metrics, \nand compliance data. \nSupplier performance \nmanagement systems, \nsupplier communications \n(emails, contracts, etc.) \nMonthly/Quarterly \nExternal \nData \nWeather data, geopolitical \nevents, economic indicators, \nand market trends. \nPublic datasets, news feeds, \nmarket reports \nReal-time/Monthly \nTextual Data Emails, suppl ier \ncommunications, customer \nfeedback, and reports \ncontaining decision -relevant \ninformation. \nInternal communication \nsystems, customer surveys, \nfeedback forms, emails, \nnews reports \nMonthly/As \navailable \n \nThis dataset is expected to provide a robust foundation for training the LLM, allowing it to derive \ninsights from both quantitative and qualitative data. The multi -source nature of the dataset \nensures that the model can consider a wide range of factors that affect decision-making within a \nsupply chain, enabling the optimization of supply chain processes. \n \nDataset Preprocessing  \nOnce the dataset is collected, preprocessing becomes the next vital step in ensuring the data is \nin a format that is suitable for the Large Language Model (LLM). Preprocessing involves  \ntransforming raw data into a clean, structured, and meaningful form, allowing the model to \nprocess the information efficiently and accurately. Initially, the dataset undergoes data cleaning, \nwhich involves the removal of any inconsistencies such as missing values, duplicate records, and \noutliers. Missing values are handled through various techniques such as imputation using mean, \nmedian, or mode for numerical data, or through the use of placeholder categories for categorical \ndata. In cases where large portions of data are missing, the corresponding rows may be excluded \nfrom the dataset. \nFor textual data, preprocessing includes tokenization, which breaks down text into smaller, \nmanageable units like words or phrases. Stop words, which are common words such as “the” and \n“and,” are removed since they do not add value to the model's understanding of the text. Further, \nlemmatization and stemming are applied to reduce words to their base form, ensuring that \ndifferent inflections of the same word are treated as a s ingle entity. This step reduces the \ndimensionality of the text while maintaining its semantic meaning. \nNumerical data is normalized or standardized to ensure that no single feature dominates due to \nscale differences. For example, if the dataset includes fe atures such as order quantities (which \nmight range from hundreds to thousands) and supplier delivery times (which might range from \ndays to hours), normalization ensures that both features contribute equally to the model's \nhttps://scientiamreearch.org/index.php/ijefms \n \n \nCOLOMBO SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING  \n \n14 \nlearning process. Categorical vari ables, such as product categories or supplier names, are \nconverted into numerical representations using techniques like one -hot encoding or label \nencoding. This step ensures that the LLM can process both numerical and categorical data \nseamlessly. \nFinally, for the unstructured textual data, techniques like embedding vectors, such as Word2Vec, \nGloVe, or BERT, are used to convert text into dense, continuous vector representations that \ncapture the semantic relationships between words. These embeddings enable th e LLM to \nunderstand the context and relationships within the text, which is essential for tasks like demand \nforecasting or sentiment analysis in supplier feedback. \n \nFeature Selection \nFeature selection is a critical step in the model development process as it helps determine which \nvariables in the dataset contribute the most to the model’s prediction accuracy. In supply chain \noptimization, the goal is to focus on those features that have the greatest impact on decision -\nmaking outcomes. The selection process begins with analyzing the correlation between various \nfeatures and the target variable. For instance, certain variables such as supplier delivery \nperformance or lead times might be strongly correlated with the decision to reorder inventory \nor to switch sup pliers. Highly correlated features can be combined or eliminated to avoid \nmulticollinearity and improve model performance. \nMethods like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and mutual information gain are used to \nsystematically eliminate irrelevant or redun dant features from the dataset. RFE works by \nrecursively removing the least important features based on the model's performance, while \nmutual information helps measure the amount of shared information between a feature and the \ntarget variable, highlighting which features carry the most predictive power. Feature selection \ntechniques also involve the use of domain expertise to manually identify key features that might \nnot necessarily be captured through automated methods. For example, industry -specific \nfeatures, such as product shelf -life for perishable goods or geopolitical risk factors for \ninternational suppliers, might be crucial for optimizing supply chain decisions. \nThe goal of feature selection is to reduce dimensionality, making the model more interpret able \nand computationally efficient, while retaining the most relevant information for accurate \npredictions. After this step, the selected features are passed on to the next stage of model \ndevelopment for further refinement. \n \nFeature Engineering \nFeature engineering is a process that goes beyond the raw data to create new features that help \nimprove the model’s predictive performance. This step requires a deep understanding of the \nsupply chain domain and the ability to translate real-world factors into variables that the model \ncan process effectively. For example, time-related features, such as weekly or monthly demand \npatterns, can be generated from raw transaction data to help identify seasonal trends in the \nsupply chain. Features like lead time variations or  production efficiency metrics might be \nderived from historical supplier data to capture more subtle variations that impact the supply \nchain’s performance. \nAdditionally, new features can be created by interacting different features, such as combining \norder quantities with supplier lead times to assess the optimal reorder points. Aggregating data \nat different levels can reveal new patterns; for example, calculating the average delivery time for \neach supplier and using this as a feature might provide insights  into potential delivery delays. \nTextual data will also undergo feature engineering, where embeddings, topic modeling, and \nsentiment analysis can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from unstructured data \nsources such as supplier feedback or custome r reviews. These textual insights will be used as \nfeatures that allow the model to make more informed decisions, like adjusting inventory levels \nbased on changing customer sentiment or supplier feedback. \nhttps://scientiamreearch.org/index.php/ijefms \n \n \nCOLOMBO SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING \n \n15 \nAnother crucial aspect of feature engineering involv es transforming raw time -series data into \nfeatures that capture trends, seasonality, and cycles. Techniques such as Fourier transforms, or \nautocorrelation can be applied to identify hidden patterns in supply chain data that would \notherwise go unnoticed. \n \nModel Evaluation \nOnce the LLM is trained on the preprocessed dataset with the engineered features, it is essential \nto evaluate its performance rigorously to ensure that it effectively optimizes supply chain \ndecision-making. The evaluation phase involves the use of several metrics tailored to the specific \ntasks the model is designed to solve, such as demand forecasting, supplier selection, or inventory \nmanagement. \nFor classification tasks, where the model predicts discrete outcomes (e.g., whether a supplier \nwill meet delivery deadlines), metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 -score are used to \nassess the model’s ability to correctly classify instances. These metrics help balance false \npositives and false negatives, ensuring that the model can make re liable decisions, particularly \nin high-stakes scenarios like selecting suppliers or predicting stockouts. \nFor regression tasks, where the model predicts continuous values (e.g., demand forecasts or \ndelivery times), common evaluation metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared \nerror (MSE), and R-squared. MAE provides a measure of how far off the model’s predictions are \nfrom the actual values, while MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily, and R-squared indicates \nhow well the model explains the variability in the target variable. \nCross-validation is employed to test the model’s robustness and prevent overfitting. This \ntechnique divides the data into multiple subsets, ensuring that the model is evaluated on various \nportions of the dataset and can g eneralize well to unseen data. Additionally, performance is \nmonitored over time to detect any degradation in predictive accuracy, especially as the supply \nchain environment evolves. Comparisons against traditional optimization models will also be \nmade to assess whether the LLM offers tangible improvements in decision-making efficiency and \naccuracy. \nThe final evaluation phase might also include business -specific KPIs, such as cost reduction in \nprocurement, improvements in delivery times, or enhancements in inventory turnover rates, to \nvalidate the model’s real-world impact on supply chain operations. \n \nRESULTS \n \nThe results section presents an in -depth evaluation of the Large Language Model (LLM) in \noptimizing supply chain decision-making. The focus of this eva luation is on the model's ability \nto improve various supply chain processes such as demand forecasting, supplier selection, \ninventory management, and logistics optimization. Additionally, a comparison is made between \nthe performance of the LLM and several traditional machine learning models, including Random \nForest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Deep \nNeural Networks (DNN), on a range of key metrics. The aim of this section is to determine which \nmodel delivers superior performance and provides optimal decision-making capabilities in the \nsupply chain domain. \nThe effectiveness of the models is assessed through various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, \nprecision, recall, F1 -score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Sq uared Error (MSE), and \nprocessing time. These metrics are critical for understanding how well the models predict and \noptimize decision -making outcomes in the supply chain, ultimately impacting operational \nefficiency, cost reduction, and decision-making accuracy. Furthermore, the ability of the LLM to \nprocess and analyze both structured and unstructured data from various sources, including \ntransactional data, communication logs, and customer feedback, is an important factor in its \nsuccess. \nhttps://scientiamreearch.org/index.php/ijefms \n \n \nCOLOMBO SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING  \n \n16 \nModel Performance Across Different Tasks \nThe performance of the models was evaluated on four key supply chain tasks: demand \nforecasting, supplier selection, inventory management, and logistics optimization. Each of these \ntasks presents unique challenges and requires different types of data. The LLM’s ability to handle \nboth structured data (e.g., numerical transaction records) and unstructured data (e.g., supplier \ncommunications, customer feedback, market reports) gives it an edge over traditional models, \nwhich are typically limited to structured data. \n \nDemand Forecasting \nDemand forecasting is one of the most critical tasks in supply chain optimization. Accurate \ndemand forecasting allows businesses to make informed decisions about procurement, \nproduction schedules, and inventory levels. The LLM was tested on historical demand data, \nwhich included variables such as order volumes, sales trends, and market fluctuations. The \nmodel’s ability to capture seasonal patterns, long-term trends, and sudden shifts in demand was \nevaluated through the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). \nThe LLM outperformed all other models in this task, achieving a MAE of 12.34, which is \nsignificantly lower than Random Forest (14.56) and Gradient Boosting Machines (13.12). This \nsuggests that the LLM is better e quipped to capture the complexities of demand patterns, \nespecially in dynamic and unpredictable markets. The superior performance of the LLM can be \nattributed to its ability to incorporate both structured data (e.g., sales records) and unstructured \ndata (e .g., customer sentiment and market reports), which allows it to identify and forecast \ndemand shifts with greater accuracy. \n \nSupplier Selection \nThe selection of suppliers is another key decision in supply chain management. The goal is to \nidentify suppliers who can meet delivery deadlines, provide high -quality products, and offer \ncompetitive prices. The LLM was evaluated on its ability to predict supplier performance based \non historical data, including delivery times, order fulfillment rates, and quality metr ics. \nAdditionally, unstructured data from supplier communications and feedback was also \nconsidered, providing a deeper understanding of supplier reliability. \nThe LLM achieved an accuracy of 91.5% in the supplier selection task, outperforming Random \nForest (88.4%) and Support Vector Machine (86.5%). This performance can be attributed to the \nLLM’s ability to process and analyze unstructured data, such as supplier emails, customer \nreviews, and other textual communications, which provide valuable insights into supplier \nreliability and customer satisfaction. This capability enables the LLM to make more informed \nand accurate supplier selection decisions, resulting in a more optimized supply chain. \n \nInventory Management \nEffective inventory management is crucial for maintaining optimal stock levels, reducing excess \ninventory, and minimizing stockouts. The LLM was tested on its ability to predict inventory \nlevels, reorder points, and stock turnover rates. The model’s performance in this task was \nevaluated through the Mean Squared Error (MSE), with lower values indicating more accurate \npredictions. \nIn inventory management, the LLM demonstrated superior performance with an MSE of 10.24, \noutperforming Gradient Boosting Machines (11.45) and Deep Neural Networks (11.12). Th is \nresult suggests that the LLM is particularly effective in predicting inventory needs, especially \nwhen taking into account factors such as sales trends, supplier performance, and lead times. \nAdditionally, the LLM’s ability to process unstructured data, such as supplier delays and market \nconditions, likely contributes to its higher accuracy in forecasting inventory requirements. \n \n \nhttps://scientiamreearch.org/index.php/ijefms \n \n \nCOLOMBO SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING \n \n17 \nLogistics Optimization \nLogistics optimization involves the efficient management of delivery schedules, transportation \nroutes, a nd cost minimization. The LLM was evaluated on its ability to optimize logistics \noperations, focusing on delivery times, route planning, and logistics costs. The model’s \nperformance was evaluated using the F1 -score, a metric that balances precision and rec all in \ntasks involving classification. A higher F1 -score indicates better overall performance in \nidentifying the optimal logistics decisions. \nThe LLM achieved an F1-score of 0.84, surpassing Random Forest (0.79) and Gradient Boosting \nMachines (0.81). This indicates that the LLM is particularly adept at making logistics decisions \nby effectively analyzing both structured data (e.g., delivery times, transportation costs) and \nunstructured data (e.g., shipping instructions, real -time updates, and weather conditi ons). The \nability of the LLM to interpret such data allows it to make more accurate and efficient logistics \ndecisions, ultimately reducing costs and improving delivery performance. \n \nComparison of Model Performance \nThe following table summarizes the performance of the LLM and other machine learning models \nacross various supply chain decision -making tasks.

The LLM’s ability to process and analyze both structured and unstructured \ndata gives it a significant advantage over models t hat rely solely on structured data. This is \nparticularly evident in tasks such as supplier selection and logistics optimization, where \nunstructured data such as supplier feedback, customer reviews, and real -time shipping \ninformation play a crucial role in making informed decisions. \nIn demand forecasting, the LLM achieved the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE), demonstrating \nits superior ability to predict demand patterns and make accurate forecasts. This is a crucial \ncapability in supply chain management, as accurate demand forecasts enable businesses to \noptimize procurement, production, and inventory management. \nIn inventory management, the LLM demonstrated the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE), \nindicating its ability to make accurate predictions regarding stoc k levels, reorder points, and \nturnover rates. This performance suggests that the LLM can better handle the complexities of \ninventory management by incorporating a wider range of factors, including supplier delays and \nexternal market conditions. \nIn logistic s optimization, the LLM’s F1 -score was the highest, suggesting that it is better at \nbalancing precision and recall when optimizing delivery routes and minimizing transportation \ncosts. The LLM’s ability to understand and process real-time data, such as traffic conditions and \nweather reports, contributes to its superior performance in this area. \nDespite its superior performance, the LLM does require more processing time compared to some \ntraditional models, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machines.  However, the \nincreased computational time is justified by the LLM’s ability to provide more accurate and \nactionable insights across a range of supply chain tasks. \nThe results of this study demonstrate that the Large Language Model (LLM) significantly \n12.34\n14.56\n13.12\n15.67\n13.89\n91.50%\n88.40%\n89.20%\n86.50%\n90.30%\n10.24\n12.36\n11.45\n13.67\n11.12\n0.84\n0.79\n0.81\n0.75\n0.8\n110\n70\n120\n150\n200\nL A R G E  L A N G U A G E  \nM O D E L  ( L L M )\nR A N D O M  F O R E S T  \n( R F )\nG R A D I E N T  \nB O O S T I N G  \nM A C H I N E S  ( G B M )\nS U P P O R T  V E C T O R  \nM A C H I N E  ( S V M )\nD E E P  N E U R A L  \nN E T W O R K S  ( D N N )\nMODEL EVALUATION \nDemand Forecasting (MAE) Supplier Selection (Accuracy)\nInventory Management (MSE) Logistics Optimization (F1-Score)\nProcessing Time (Seconds)\nhttps://scientiamreearch.org/index.php/ijefms \n \n \nCOLOMBO SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING \n \n19 \noutperforms traditional machine learning models in optimizing supply chain decision -making. \nThe LLM’s unique ability to process both structured and unstructured data allows it to capture \ncomplex relationships and patterns within the supply chain, leading to mo re accurate \npredictions and more informed decision -making. While the LLM does require more \ncomputational resources, its superior performance in key supply chain tasks such as demand \nforecasting, supplier selection, inventory management, and logistics optim ization makes it the \nmost effective model for supply chain optimization. \n \nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  \n \nThe objective of this study was to explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in \noptimizing supply chain decision -making, particularly in tasks  such as demand forecasting, \nsupplier selection, inventory management, and logistics optimization. The performance of LLMs \nwas compared against traditional machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), \nGradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Deep Neural Networks \n(DNN). The results demonstrated that LLMs significantly outperform traditional models in most \nsupply chain decision-making tasks, particularly when it comes to handling both structured and \nunstructured data sources. \nThe LLM’s ability to process and derive insights from unstructured data, such as supplier \ncommunications, customer feedback, and market reports, gives it a distinct advantage over \ntraditional models, which rely predominantly on structured data. This capability allows the LLM \nto capture more complex, dynamic patterns in supply chain processes, leading to more accurate \npredictions and optimized decision -making. For example, the LLM’s superior performance in \ndemand forecasting, as reflected in the lower M ean Absolute Error (MAE), indicates that it can \nbetter account for seasonal trends, market disruptions, and other factors that may influence \ndemand. \nAnother area where LLMs excel is supplier selection. By incorporating unstructured data from \nsupplier commu nications, emails, and feedback, the LLM can provide a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of supplier performance, reliability, and customer satisfaction. This enhances \ndecision-making regarding which suppliers to engage, helping businesses reduce risks \nassociated with poor supplier performance and improve overall supply chain efficiency. The \nhigher accuracy of the LLM in supplier selection, compared to RF and SVM, underscores the value \nof integrating both structured and unstructured data for more informed decision-making. \nIn inventory management, the LLM demonstrated a clear edge over the other models in terms of \nMean Squared Error (MSE), showing that it can predict inventory requirements and optimize \nreorder points with greater accuracy. This capability is critical for preventing both overstocking \nand stockouts, which can be costly for businesses. By incorporating a variety of data sources, \nincluding transactional history and supplier lead times, the LLM can optimize inventory \nmanagement more effectively than traditional models. \nLogistics optimization was another area where the LLM outperformed the other models, \nachieving the highest F1-score. The ability to optimize delivery routes and reduce transportation \ncosts is crucial for businesses seeking to improve logistics efficiency. The LLM’s ability to process \nreal-time data, such as weather conditions and traffic reports, along with historical logistics data, \nallows it to make smarter, more efficient logistics decisions. This is particularly important in the \ncontext of today’s global supply chains, where logistics efficiency can have a significant impact \non cost and customer satisfaction. \nHowever, it is important to note that while LLMs deliver superior performance in these tasks, \nthey do come with some trade -offs. One of the main challenges is the computational resources \nrequired to train and deploy LLMs, which can be a barrier for smaller organizations. The \nincreased processing time compared to traditional models may also limit the speed at which \ndecisions can be made, especially in fast-paced environments. Moreover, the integration of LLMs \nhttps://scientiamreearch.org/index.php/ijefms \n \n \nCOLOMBO SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING  \n \n20 \ninto existing supply chain systems requires careful consideration of data compatibility, \npreprocessing, and feature engineering to ensure accurate and effective implementation. \nIn conclusion, this study highlights the significant potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in \noptimizing supply chain decision -making. The results clearly show that LLMs outperform \ntraditional machine learning models in key tasks such as demand forecasting, supplier selection, \ninventory management, and logistics optimization. The ability of LLMs to integrate and process \nboth structured and unstructured data gives them a distinct advantage over traditional models, \nenabling businesses to make more informed, accurate, and timely decisions. \nWhile LLMs demonstrate superior performance in various supply chain tasks, there are \nchallenges associated with their use, particularly in terms of computational resources and \nintegration with existing supply chain syst ems. Despite these challenges, the findings suggest \nthat LLMs have the potential to revolutionize supply chain management by improving decision-\nmaking accuracy and efficiency. As the technology continues to evolve, it is expected that LLMs \nwill become more accessible and easier to integrate into supply chain systems, further enhancing \ntheir impact on business operations. \nFuture research should focus on addressing the challenges of resource -intensive computations \nand exploring methods to make LLMs more accessible to smaller organizations. Additionally, \nresearch could investigate the application of LLMs in other areas of supply chain management, \nsuch as risk management, demand sensing, and real-time decision support systems. Ultimately, \nthe integration of  LLMs into supply chain decision -making processes represents a promising \nstep toward more efficient, data-driven, and adaptive supply chains. \n \nAcknowledgement: All the author contributed equally  \n \nREFERENCE  \n \n1.
