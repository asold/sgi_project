    "abstract": "Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) constitute the most valuable aspect of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). However, TTPs are often implicit in unstructured text, necessitating manual analysis by field experts. Automating the classification of TTPs from unstructured text is a crucial task in contemporary research. MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK serves as the de facto standard for studying TTPs. Existing research constructs classification datasets based on its procedural examples for tactics and techniques. However, due to a significant proportion of small sample categories, a long-tail phenomenon exists, leading to a highly imbalanced sample distribution. Consequently, more research concentrates on categories with relatively abundant samples. This paper proposes a method that combines ChatGPT data augmentation with Instruction Supervised Fine-Tuning of open large language models. This approach offers a solution for TTPs classification in few-shot learning scenarios, achieving coverage of 625 technical categories. The Precision, Recall, and F1 scores reach 86.2%, 89.9%, and 87.3%, respectively.",
