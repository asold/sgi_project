    "abstract": "Abstract Learning mathematics is a science that is learned as a very important basis for everyday life the lesson study for learning community learning process that prioritizes group learning that involves peers in learning so that the creative thinking process between students increases. Along with the development of very sophisticated technology demands online-based learning to facilitate the learning process and able to support students’ creative thinking which can be measured from fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration. The research aimed to develop lesson study for learning community based learning tools using google classroom media on three-variable linear equations material for X grade high school students and to determine the effect on students’ creative thinking abilities. This research uses a mix method with a sequential Explorstorydesign combination model with a thiagardjan development model through the 4D domain, which are define, design, develop and deseminate inexperimental research using the nonequivalent control design with the results obtained from the pretest value functions to determine the initial knowledge and posttest for knowing knowledge after being given treatment. The results showed that the lesson study for learning community based learning tools using google classroom media were valid, practical and effective and had a significant impact on creative thinking.",
