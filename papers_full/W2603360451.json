  "full_text": "RESEARCH Open Access\nAn appraisal of analytical tools used in\npredicting clinical outcomes following\nradiation therapy treatment of men with\nprostate cancer: a systematic review\nElspeth Raymond 1, Michael E. O ’Callaghan1,2,7,8*, Jared Campbell 9, Andrew D. Vincent 1,2, Kerri Beckmann 1,3,\nDavid Roder 3, Sue Evans 4, John McNeil 4, Jeremy Millar 5, John Zalcberg 4,11, Martin Borg 6 and Kim Moretti 1,2,3,9,10\nAbstract\nBackground: Prostate cancer can be treated with several different modalities, including radiation treatment. Various\nprognostic tools have been developed to aid decision making by providing estimates of the probability of different\noutcomes. Such tools have been demonstrated to have better prognostic accuracy than clinical judgment alone.\nMethods: A systematic review was undertaken to identify papers relating to the prediction of clinical outcomes\n(biochemical failure, metastasis, survival) in patients with prostate cancer who received radiation treatment, with the\nparticular aim of identifying whether published tools are adequately developed, validated, and provide accurate\npredictions. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from July 2007. Title and abstract screening, full text review, and\ncritical appraisal were conducted by two reviewers. A review protocol was published in advance of commencing\nliterature searches.\nResults: The search strategy resulted in 165 potential articles, of which 72 were selected for full text review and\n47 ultimately included. These papers described 66 models which were newly developed and 31 which were external\nvalidations of already published predictive tools. The included studies represented a total of 60,457 patients, recruited\nbetween 1984 and 2009. Sixty five percent of models were not externally validated, 57% did not report accuracy and\n31% included variables which are not readily accessible in existing datasets. Most models (72, 74%) related to external\nbeam radiation therapy with the remainder relating to brachytherapy (alone or in combination with external beam\nradiation therapy).\nConclusions: A large number of prognostic models (97) have been described in the recent literature, representing\na rapid increase since previous reviews (17 papers, 1966 – 2007). Most models described were not validated and a\nthird utilised variables which are not readily accessible in existing data collections. Where validation had occurred,\nit was often limited to data taken from single institutes in the US. While validated and accurate models are available\nto predict prostate cancer specific mortality following external beam radiation therapy, there is a scarcity of such tools\nrelating to brachytherapy. This review provides an accessible catalogue of predictive tools for current use and which\nshould be prioritised for future validation.\nKeywords: Prostate cancer, Systematic literature review, Nomogram, Outcomes, Survival, Biochemical recurrence\n* Correspondence: Michael.ocallaghan@health.sa.gov.au\n1South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative\n(SA-PCCOC), Adelaide, Australia\n2Freemasons Foundation Centre for Men ’s Health, University of Adelaide,\nAdelaide, Australia\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Radiation Oncology  (2017) 12:56 \nDOI 10.1186/s13014-017-0786-z\nBackground\nRationale\nProstate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men glo-\nbally, with 1.4 million new cases reported in 2013 [1].\nProstate cancer cases increased by 217% between 1990\nand 2013 as a result of population growth and aging and\nincreased uptake of opportunistic screening, particularly\nin developing countries [1]. Prostate cancer remains the\nleading cause of death among males in 24 of 188 coun-\ntries covered by the Global Burden of Disease Cancer\nCollaboration [1].\nProstate cancer treatments are varied and include: de-\nferred treatment (active surveillance), watchful waiting,\nradical prostatectomy, radiation therapy (with or without\nandrogen deprivation therapy) or androgen deprivation\ntherapy (ADT) [2, 3]. Each treatment will achieve differ-\nent outcomes in terms of oncology (e.g., survival or time\nto biochemical recurrence), adverse events and patient\nreported outcomes such as urinary incontinence and im-\npotence. These outcomes are important considerations\nwhen selecting a treatment for prostate cancer patients\nand are considered in the context of patient age, life ex-\npectancy, co-morbidities, tumour size, grade and stage\nand other risk indicators that influence outcomes and\ntreatment choice. Determining which treatment choice\nis optimal for each patient remains an important chal-\nlenge, particularly where directly relevant randomised\ncontrolled data is lacking.\nTo aid this decision making process, a number of tools\nhave been developed with nomograms and risk stratifi-\ncation systems most commonly used [4]. Nomograms\nare graphic tools developed to aid clinical decision mak-\ning and are well established in clinical practice for\nprostate cancer, particularly for assisting selection of\ntreatment approaches based on risk stratification. Such\ntools have been shown to improve prediction of out-\ncomes when compared with clinician judgement alone\n[5, 6]. Unfortunately most nomograms currently in use\nare likely to be based on dated treatment modalities.\nFurthermore predictions based on observations made in\none setting may not be accurate in another (e.g., where\nethnicity or health services differ). Extrapolation of pub-\nlished international results to local practice is a known\npitfall that has potential to mislead both clinicians and\npatients [7]. These limitations are particularly relevant to\npredictive tools designed for use in patients treated with\nradiation therapy as this modality has changed signifi-\ncantly over the past decade.\nObjectives\nWe aim to identify papers predicting clinical outcomes\nfor patients with prostate cancer who have been treated\nwith radiation therapy. We particularly set out to assess\nif the tools identified were adequately developed, vali-\ndated and provide accurate predictions.\nMethods\nProtocol and registration\nA systematic literature review protocol was developed\nfor this study and registered before searches commenced\nwith PROSPERO, an international prospective register of\nsystematic reviews. The protocol can be accessed at:\nhttp://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?\nID=CRD42015025428.\nInclusion criteria\nPapers were eligible for inclusion where they met the\nfollowing criteria; Population: Patients with prostate\ncancer. Exposure: Treatment with radiation therapy\n(including external beam radiation therapy and/or\nbrachytherapy). Outcome: The generation or validation\nof a tool for the prediction of clinical outcomes (bio-\nchemical failure [BF], progression to metastases, prostate\ncancer specific survival, overall survival). Papers had to\nbe written in English and published post July 2007. This\ndate was chosen as it is the search date up to which a\nprevious systematic review of prognostic tools for\nprostate cancer treated by any therapy was undertaken\n[4]. Studies were included which described tools using\nvariables which are currently available in a clinical\nsetting. This excluded papers including genetic or\nmolecular variables.\nInformation sources\nSearches were conducted of the Medline database\n(PubMed interface) and the EMBASE database.\nSearch\nDisease-specific search terms included: prostate cancer,\nprostatic neoplasms, cancer of the prostate, adenocarcin-\noma of the prostate, prostatic cancer, prostate gland\ncancer and prostate tumour. Treatment specific search\nterms included: radiation therapy, radiotherapy, external\nbeam radiotherapy, EBRT, brachytherapy, high dose\nradiotherapy, low dose radiotherapy and targeted\nradiotherapies. Outcome-specific search terms included:\noverall survival, progression-free survival, PFS, mortality,\nevent free survival, EFS, disease free survival, prostate\ncancer specific survival, progression to metastases, time\nto progression, TTP , biochemical recurrence, BCR,\nbiochemical failure, neoplasm recurrence. Search terms\nused to identify predictive models included: predictive\ntools, nomograms, risk stratification, Partin tables, regres-\nsion tree analysis, Artificial Neural Networks, CAPRA-S\nor CAPRA score, risk estimates, algorithms, predictive\naccuracy, diagnostic test accuracy, Kattan tables/\nnomograms.\nRaymond et al. Radiation Oncology  (2017) 12:56 Page 2 of 20\nStudy selection\nStudy selection included three phases. The titles and ab-\nstracts of all studies identified by the search strategy\nwere compared to the inclusion criteria detailed above\nby two authors working independently (ER and MOC).\nAll studies that appeared likely to meet the inclusion cri-\nteria were progressed to full-text review. All discrepan-\ncies, where authors reached different conclusions about\nthe same papers, were resolved through discussion. The\nfull-texts of these papers were then retrieved and\nassessed against the inclusion criteria, again by two au-\nthors (ER, JC or MOC) working independently in order\nto minimise the impact of human error. Studies that\nwere identified as meeting all inclusion criteria were\nincluded in the review, while those which did not were\nexcluded. Again, where there were differences in the au-\nthors’ conclusions consensus on the correct decision was\nreached through discussion. Finally, the reference lists of\nincluded papers were screened for any additional rele-\nvant papers which may have been missed by the search\nstrategy. All new titles identified were then reviewed as\ndescribed above.\nData collection process and data items\nAfter full text review, data extraction was undertaken by\none reviewer (ER, JC or MOC). Items for extraction in-\ncluded: manuscript identifiers (author, contact, country,\nsetting), study methods, population studied (inclusion\ncriteria, exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics –\ndates of recruitment, age, ethnicity, number of patients,\nprimary treatment, treatment subtype, adjuvant therap-\nies, neoadjuvant therapies), and predictive model charac-\nteristics (type of model, variables included, if internal\nvalidation was reported and the type, external validation,\nvariable definitions, if variables were readily available,\nsample size, number of events, definition of outcome,\nmodel accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, concordance\nindex and receiver operator curve area under the curve).\nFor assessment as to whether or not variables were\nconsidered ‘readily available ’ the minimum data set used\nby the only national prostate cancer registry (Prostate\nCancer Outcomes Registry, Australia and New Zealand\nAustralian [8]) was used as a guide.\nQuality assessment\nQuality assessment was performed by two reviewers\n(ER, JC or MOC) for each paper. Four questions were\nselected for this assessment: 1. Was the defined repre-\nsentative sample of patients assembled at a common\n(usually early) point in the course of their disease? 2.\nWas patient follow-up sufficiently long and complete? 3.\nWere outcome criteria either objective or applied in a\n‘blind’ fashion? And 4. If subgroups with different prog-\nnoses were identified, did adjustment for important\nprognostic factors take place? These questions were se-\nlected from the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine\n‘Critical appraisal of prognostic studies ’ tool [9]. Discrep-\nancies between reviewers were discussed and consensus\nreached. Questions that were answered positively >75%\nof the time were considered to present a low risk of bias,\nthose ≤75 to >50% a moderate risk of bias, and any\n≤50% a high risk of bias. Data extraction and quality as-\nsessment were performed using the online tool\n‘Covidence’.\nResults\nThe search strategy resulted in 165 potentially relevant\nabstracts/articles and these were reduced to 72 once du-\nplicates were removed and title and abstracts were\nscreened (Fig. 1). The full-text of these papers was\nreviewed against the inclusion criteria (reasons for exclu-\nsion are reported in Additional file 1: Table S1a and b)\nand 47 finally selected. Study recruitment periods varied\nconsiderably with the earliest patients being from 1984\n[10] and the latest 2009 [10 – 13] (Table 1). The popula-\ntions of individual studies varied from 80 [14] to 7,839\n[14, 15] with a combined population of 60,457 (Tables 2,\n3 and 4). The majority of studies were retrospective\n(n = 38), however seven studies recruited prospective\ncohorts (for one study [16] it was not stated whether\nit was retrospective or prospective).\nThe 47 papers finally included in this review described\n97 individual predictive models. Of these models, 16\nrelated to brachytherapy treatment (Table 2), 72 to ex-\nternal beam radiation therapy (Table 3) and nine to a\ncombination of brachytherapy and external beam radi-\nation therapy (Table 4).\nAcross all radiation treatment modalities, outcomes\nrelating to PSA levels post treatment were most com-\nmon (39 models) followed by prostate cancer specific\nmortality (29 models). Measures of metastases (17) and\noverall survival (14 models) were less common (note\nthat some papers report more than one outcome and\nmodel). Of those studies reporting development of new\nFig. 1 Flow diagram\nRaymond et al.

Three studies re-\nport to be external validations of the Prostogram\nnomogram (also known as the Kattan nomogram), all of\nwhich have low c-indices (0.49, 0.51 and 0.66) suggesting\nthat this model is of limited clinical utility. A c-index of\n1 ‘indicates a perfect ability to rank the outcomes in the\norder they actually occurred (100% sensitivity and speci-\nficity), whereas 0.5 is a purely random ranking and is\nanalogous to the area under the receiver operator char-\nacteristic curve ’ (definition from [18]).\nThe majority of papers identified in this review re-\nported models relating to external beam radiation ther-\napy (72/97 = 74%).

Accuracy of this model is\nalso reported for the outcome of biochemical failure and\nsubgroups of patients receiving long term ADT or short\nterm ADT, all which had lower accuracy.\nExternal beam radiation therapy with brachy therapy\nNine models were identified which were specific to\npatients treated with external beam radiation therapy in\ncombination with brachytherapy. Of these models, five\n(56%) did not report accuracy. The highest accuracy was\nreported by Delouya [15, 20] (c-index 0.69) predicting\nbiochemical failure free survival at 2-years. This study\nwas based on a cohort of 744 patients and was an exter-\nnal validation of the CAPRA score.

Radiation Oncology  (2017) 12:56 Page 16 of 20\nDiscussion\nSince the publication of previous reviews, there has been\nconsiderable progress in the field of outcomes prediction\nfollowing prostate cancer treatment. This review identi-\nfied 47 papers published between 2007 and 2015, which\ndescribe 97 predictive tools for men receiving radiother-\napy. This includes 66 models which were newly devel-\noped and 31 which were validations of already published\npredictive tools. Consistent with previous reports, most\ntools (65%) are yet to be validated in a population out-\nside the derivation set. Studies were included from 2007\nas the modality of radiation therapy has changed signifi-\ncantly over the past decade, and historic data may not\nbe a useful basis for prognosis. Apart from modality, the\ntotal dose has also significantly increased however, we\nfound that only five studies [13, 16, 20 – 22] did not use\ndata from men treated as far back as the 1990s.\nThe volume of research carried out in the field of\nprognostics has exploded over the last decade. A system-\natic review that included all studies published before\nJuly 2007 (the cut-off date for inclusion in the present\nreview) identified 17 studies on prognostic models that\nrelated to prostate cancer patients treated with radio-\ntherapy [4]. In this review 39 new studies were identified\nwhich investigated prognostic markers for BCF. Unfortu-\nnately, the majority of new studies did not undertake\nvalidation, mirroring the finding of the previous sys-\ntematic review. As validation – particularly external\nvalidation – is vital for the appropriate clinical imple-\nmentation of prognostic models, this suggests that re-\nsources and efforts are not being efficiently targeted\nto improve tools available for clinical practice.\nWith regards to the methodological quality of the lit-\nerature, our critical appraisal found that overall studies\nwere at low to moderate risk of bias. The greatest risk\nwas created by insufficient follow-up (defined as a mean\nor median of ≥5 years) which only occurred in 64% of\nstudies. There was also a moderate risk of bias created\nby the possibility of included patients being at different\npoints in the course of their prostate cancer, however in\nthe majority of cases this was due to insufficient specifi-\ncity in the description of inclusion criteria as opposed to\nreported differences. There was little risk of bias created\nby the measurement of outcomes, as the main outcomes\n(biochemical failure [various definitions], metastasis, sur-\nvival) were objective, or by a lack of adjustment for im-\nportant prognostic factors as the essential factors of\nprostate cancer prognosis (PSA, Gleason score, and clin-\nical stage) were used nearly universally.\nModel accuracy was not reported in 57% of the models\nincluded. Model accuracy was reported to be highest in\nVainshtein 2014 [23] with a c-index of 0.86 derived for\nprediction of prostate cancer specific mortality with the\nCAPRA score (originally established in [24]), including\nthe addition of variables for the presence of Gleason 5\nand treatment with ADT (this c-index relates to patients\nnot receiving ADT). This study acts to externally valid-\nate the CAPRA scoring system (with modifications) in\npatients treated with external beam radiation therapy,\nthough this improvement to the score requires further\nvalidation in other populations. Of the remaining 42\nmodels which reported predictive accuracy, c indices\nwere typically in the 0.70 – 0.80 range which would be\nconsidered ‘reasonable’ according to Hosmer and Leme-\nshow [25]. Notably, those papers which did not report\nexternal validation typically had higher c-indices suggest-\ning that original model developments should be consid-\nered optimistic in their predictive capacity. The lowest\nc-index (0.49, 95%CI 0.37 to 0.61) was reported for a\nstudy [26] performing external validation of the Prosto-\ngram nomogram (originally established in [27]) suggest-\ning this nomogram may have little predictive value.\nThe predictive tools identified in this review included\njoint-modelling approaches but not neural networks\nwhich have featured in previous reviews. This may re-\nflect a change in statistical tools available since publica-\ntion of earlier catalogues [4]. Two of the survival models\n[28, 29] did not account for competing risks when pre-\ndicting prostate cancer specific mortality, a potential\nweakness which could easily be addressed.\nThe majority of papers attempted prediction relating\nto biochemical recurrence, prostate cancer specific mor-\ntality or overall survival with a smaller subset predicting\nmetastases. Sixteen of the 97 models identified related to\nbrachytherapy with 72 for external beam radiation ther-\napy and 9 a combination of the two. This could reflect\nmore wide-spread use of external beam radiation ther-\napy, and we might anticipate more tools relating to HDR\nbrachytherapy (with or without EBRT) in the future.\nThere is a dearth of externally validated nomograms\nfocusing on brachytherapy and brachytherapy in com-\nbination with external beam radiation therapy particu-\nlarly looking at overall survival and cancer specific\nsurvival outcomes.\nThis study did not explicitly set out to uncover tools\nincorporating novel variables, but only those which\ncould be used in current clinical settings. Despite this,\n31% of studies included reference to variables which\nhave been less studied to date (e.g. mid-point PSA\nlevels). While such variables may prove useful, there is\ncurrently limited opportunity to validate these observa-\ntions using existing datasets. It is possible that add-\nitional variables including standardised measures of\ncomorbidity, imaging features or genetic markers,\nwhich are becoming more accessible may help to\nimprove the accuracy of future models. For a recent\nreview of potential molecular and genetic candidate see\nHall et al. 2016 [30].\nRaymond et al. Radiation Oncology  (2017) 12:56 Page 17 of 20\nMost predictive tools identified in this review were de-\nveloped in US populations. This observation should be\nconsidered by clinicians who are based outside the US\nwhen selecting a predictive model to assist treatment deci-\nsion making. Where possible, tools validated in a setting\nsimilar to one ’s own clinical practice should be selected for\nuse. The number of tools available internationally would\nbe increased with additional validation work conducted\noutside the US and particularly in multi-national cohorts.\nWe observed a large degree of variation in the quality of\nreporting clinical predictive tools. This may stem from the\nfact that authors are not aware of reporting guidelines in the\nfield or indeed that such guidelines exist. The TRIPOD\nguidelines (http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guide\nlines/tripod-statement/) for reporting of multivariable predic-\ntion models were published in March 2015, shortly before\nthe cut-off for papers included in this review. These guide-\nlines have been widely endorsed and published in key\njournals [31– 39]. Further publication of multivariable models\nwould benefit greatly from adherence to these guidelines.\nConclusions\nTools which aid decision making offer more accurate pre-\ndiction of clinical outcomes when compared to clinical\njudgement alone. This understanding has led to a large in-\ncrease in the number of predictive tools relating to clinical\noutcomes post radiation therapy between 2007 and 2015.\nThis review identifies 47 papers describing 97 models\npublished in the period, a substantial increase compared\nto the 17 models previously described between 1966 and\n2007. Of the models identified, 65% had no external valid-\nation and 57% did not report accuracy. Thirty one percent\nof models included variables which are not part of typical\nregistry data sets, and are therefore difficult to validate.\nDespite these limitations, there are accurate and externally\nvalidated models for external beam radiation therapy\ntreatment which predict prostate cancer specific mortality.\nThere are fewer models which accurately predict out-\ncomes following brachytherapy (alone or in combination\nwith external beam radiation therapy). This review pro-\nvides an accessible catalogue of predictive tools which\ncould be used currently (i.e. those with high accuracy after\nexternal validation) and identifies those which should be\nprioritised for future validation.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Reasons for exclusion from the review.
