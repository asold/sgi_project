INTRODUCTION\nThe service life of an oil-immersed transformer is mainly\ndecided by its insulation lifetime, especially by its solid insu-\nlation, which is the weakest component of the transformer\n[1], [2]. Thus, the aging condition of transformers can be\nobtained by the condition assessment of the insulation paper.\nHowever, the insulation paper in transformers can hardly be\nobtained without power failure in practice [3]. Therefore,\na series of assessment method, such as dissolved gas analysis,\nfurfural analysis, dielectric response, and methanol content,\nhas been subsequently developed to evaluate the aging state\nof insulation paper [4], [7].\nAmong all these assessment methods, furfural content in\noil is considered a reliable method for it directly relates to\npaper degradation [8]. With the operation of transformers,\nthe furfural content in oil gradually increases with the degra-\ndation of the Kraft insulation paper [9], which is most com-\nmonly used insulation paper in transformers. Therefore, many\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Youqing Wang.\ncountries have clear regulations on the furfural content in\ntransformer oil to prevent excessively aged transformers from\ncontinuing to work. Taking China as an example, the regula-\ntions stipulate that the furfural content in oil for a 20-year-\ntransformer should be less than 0.75 mg/L, otherwise it may\nbe over-aged. The oil-paper insulation in transformers may\nseriously age when the furfural content in oil exceeds 4 mg/L\n[10]. It should be noted that the IEC standard stipulates that\nfurfural content in unused insulation oil should be low [11],\nwhich is always understood to be less than 0.1 mg/kg.\nTo evaluate the aging extent of insulation paper, many\nexperiments have been conducted to establish the relationship\nbetween the degree of polymerization (DP) of insulation\npaper and the furfural content in oil, which shows that the\nlogarithmic value of furfural content in oil is linearly related\nto the DP values of insulation paper [12], [13]. However,\nthese obtained relationships are difﬁcult to match with on-\nsite measurements [9], [14].\nFrankly speaking, the accuracy of furfural assessment is\nrelated to stability of furfural in insulting oil.

Fenget al.: Influential Factors and Correction Method of Furfural Content in Transformer Oil\nthe stability of furfural has always been a controversial prob-\nlem. J. Unsworth and F. Mitchell tested the stability of fur-\nfural in oil at 20 ◦C, 80◦C, and 110 ◦C, and they corroborated\nthat furfural is only stable at low temperatures (less than\n80◦C), and the furfural content in oil may drop drastically\nat 110 ◦C [15]. P. Grifﬁn afﬁrmed that furfural degrades sig-\nniﬁcantly with copper at 140 ◦C and proposed furfural was\nnot stable at high temperature [16]. On the contrary, H. Kan\nkept insulation oil containing furfural at 100 ◦C for 2 months\nand veriﬁed that the furfural content was invariant, thereby\nconcluding that furfural is stable [17]. A parallel view was\npresented by A. Emsley [18]; he afﬁrmed that apparent degra-\ndation of furfural only occurs when the temperature rises to\nmore than 160 ◦C.\nFor free-breathing transformers, oxygen is an inevitable\nfactor, which may also affect the furfural content in oil.\nD. Allan placed insulation oil containing furfural in an envi-\nronment with oxygen and validated that furfural contents\nnoticeably decreased at 90 ◦C and 110 ◦C [19]. Moreover,\nL. Lewand elucidated that furfural content in oil should grad-\nually increase with the aging of transformers. Nevertheless,\noxygen from air makes the furfural content in ﬁeld transform-\ners unchangeable [20].\nThe stability of furfural is related to the environment in\nwhich it is located, and distinctive conditions may achieve\na different conclusion. The controversy of existing research\nmainly focuses on whether furfural degrades at different tem-\nperatures, which will be further conﬁrmed. To date, the effect\nof copper on furfural content in oil at the operating tem-\nperatures of transformers is unknown, which, nevertheless,\nis critical for the accuracy of aging assessment with furfural\ncontent for much copper exists in transformers. Furfural\ndegrades with the effect of oxygen, but the impact extent of\noxygen on furfural assessment requires further analysis. More\nimportantly, how to correct the furfural content affected by\noxygen is another problem.\nIn this study, the stability of furfural in insulation oil at\ndifferent conditions is investigated by one-factor-at-a-time\nmethod. Then degradation products of furfural in oil are\nstudied to determine methods for improving the accuracy of\nfurfural analysis.\nII. EXPERIMENTS\nA. EXPERIMENT SCHEDULE\nStandard requires the temperature of top oil, which is the\nhighest temperature of oil in transformers, in full-load oil-\nimmersed transformers cannot exceed 85 ◦C [21]. Field trans-\nformers are always not on full load to ensure reliability. Thus,\nthe operating temperature of transformer oil is even signiﬁ-\ncantly low, generally approximately 40◦C–70◦C. Even during\ntransformer overload, the transformer oil temperature can\nhardly exceed 110 ◦C. Moreover, accelerated thermal aging\ntests are always conducted at temperatures above 110 ◦C to\nshorten aging time [1], [22]. Therefore, four temperatures\n(70◦C, 90 ◦C, 110 ◦C and 130 ◦C) are selected to explore the\nstability of furfural under operating temperatures of trans-\nformers and experimental temperatures.\nMeanwhile, copper bars were added into some oil samples\nto explore the effect of copper on the stability of furfural given\nthat copper has a catalytic effect on many reactions. The mass\nof copper bar added into oil is 0.38 times of the insulation oil\naccording to IEC 296, except for the last two groups, which\nare 0.19 and 0.76 times. The surface area is the same except\nfor the last two groups because copper bars are rectangular\nsheets, which indicates that the surface area of the copper bar\nis linearly correlated with the mass.\nThe test results of the furfural content in ﬁeld transformer\nindicate that furfural degraded with the effect of oxygen [20].\nConsidering that the working temperature of transformer oil\nis always low at 40 ◦C−70◦C, furoic acid is likely to be\nthe main degradation product of furfural. Further, for the\nexperiment with oxygen, the furoic acid content in oil has\nbeen detected to conﬁrm this inference. Assuming that the\ndegradation products of furfural with oxygen are known and\nthat they can steadily exist in oil, furfural analysis of trans-\nformers in air condition may be corrected. Table 1 exhibits\nthe plan of a one-factor-at-a-time experiment.\nIllustrating that the furfural is directly added to the insula-\ntion oil is necessary to eliminate the effect of other factors.\nThe initial furfural content in oil was set about 15 mg/L\nmainly because nearly all furfural contents in ﬁeld transform-\ners are less than 15 mg/L [9]. However, controlling the precise\nfurfural amount added to the oil is not an easy task. Therefore,\nTABLE 1. Experimental schedule of the stability of furfural.\n53488 VOLUME 7, 2019\nD. Fenget al.: Influential Factors and Correction Method of Furfural Content in Transformer Oil\nFIGURE 1. Sectional view of the stainless steel tank 1–tank, 2–rubber\ngasket, 3–fastening ring, 4–cover, and 5 and 6–valve.\nthere may be a slight difference in the initial furfural content\nin each group, which will be listed in Tables later.\nB. EXPERIMENTAL DEVICE\nThe device utilized in this experiment is stainless steel tank\n(Figure 1). The rubber gasket and the fastening ring seal the\ntank well; the valves on the top of the tank are air-proof\nwhen they are turned off, and they help eliminate the air\ninside the tank; and the valve at the bottom of the tank is\nused for sampling. The pressure inside the tank is higher\nthan atmospheric pressure owing to gas expansion coupled\nwith the evaporation of some oil caused by high temperature,\nwhich helps in sampling because the internal high pressure\npushes some oil out when valve 6 is opened.\nC. EXPERIMENT PROGRESS\nThe main experimental materials in this experiment include\nKaramay naphthenic mineral insulation oil (25#), copper bar,\nand analytical reagent (AR) furfural.\nThe experiment progress can be described as follows. First,\nfor each 1 L insulation oil, 13 µL AR furfural was added\nwith a micropipette, making the furfural content in oil was\nroughly 15 mg/L after dissolution (the density of furfural\nis 1.16 g/mL); subsequently, the oil containing furfural was\ndried at 90 ◦C for 2 days in a vacuum atmosphere to remove\ngas and most of moisture. The moisture content in dried oil\nis about 10 ∼15 ppm. The volume of the tank was 3 L,\nand 2.4 L the oil was transferred into each tank considering\nthe thermal expansion of oil. Some of these tanks contained\ncopper bars as planned. Thereafter, progresses were different\nbased on experiments with or without oxygen. For the exper-\niments without oxygen, the tanks were sealed under nitrogen\ncondition; thus, the gas above the oil was nitrogen. For the\nexperiments with oxygen, the tanks were sealed under air\ncondition; thus, 0.6 L of air was above the oil. Finally, the\ndevices were kept in a constant temperature environment as\nplanned, and oil samples were taken regularly for parameter\nmeasurement.\nD. PARAMETER MEASUREMENT\nThe most important parameter is furfural content in oil in\nthis experiment, and it can be easily measured by high per-\nformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in accordance with\nthe IEC 61198 [23]. Every sample had been measured 3 times,\nand the average value was taken as the result.\nNo standard test is available to test the furoic acid content\nin oil; hence, the test method is explored ﬁrst. Extraction\nis used to separate furoic acid and oil, which is similar to\nthe furfural test method. According to the conclusion by\nH. Y . Li [24], distilled water is a good extraction agent for\nfuroic acid. Therefore, distilled water is used for the extrac-\ntion here, and the furoic acid content in water is tested by\nHPLC. The main steps can be described as follows:\n1) 0.025 g furoic acid (AR) is dissolved in 25 mL n-octanol\nto obtain mother liquor of furoic acid with a concentration\nof 1000 mg/L.\n2) 1 mL mother liquor in a 50-mL volumetric ﬂask is taken,\ndiluted with insulation oil to volume and mixed to obtain\nstandard oil sample with 20 mg/L furoic acid. 10 mL of the\nstandard oil sample is taken out and is then diluted to 20 mL\nto acquire standard oil sample with 10 mg/L furoic acid. 5,\n2, 1, and 0.5 mg/L standard oil samples are obtained by the\nsame method.\n3) 2 mL standard oil sample is taken from each of the\nsix concentrations of the standard solution and placed in\ncentrifuge tubes in turn. Every tube is diluted with distilled\nwater to 6 mL, and vibrated for 5 minutes for sufﬁcient\nexaction.\nFIGURE 2. One of the test result of furoic acid in transformer oil by HPLC.\nTABLE 2. Test condition of furoic acid.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 53489\nD. Fenget al.: Influential Factors and Correction Method of Furfural Content in Transformer Oil\n4) After stewing the tubes for stratiﬁcation, we use a micro\nsyringe to transfer the subnatant. The peak areas of these six\nstandard solutions are measured by HPLC, and the standard\ncontent curve of furoic acid in insulation oil is established.\n5) For the samples, the peak area of the furoic acid is\nmeasured by the same method, and the concentration of furoic\nacid in insulation oil is calculated with the standard curve.\nOther test conditions are listed in Table 2. Test result of a\nsample (0−6 min) is represented in Figure 2 according to this\nmethod, and the peak at 4.493 minutes is exactly the furoic\nacid.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nA. EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND COPPER ON THE\nSTABILITY OF FURFURAL\nIn the experiments without oxygen and copper, the initial fur-\nfural contents are listed in Table 3 and the variation of furfural\ncontents in insulation oil with time at different temperature\nare presented in Figure 3. The results show furfural content\nin oil remains unchanged at these four temperatures besides\nsome measuring error. Although the temperature reaches high\nlevels such as 130 ◦C, the furfural content hardly reduces\nin 40 days. Therefore, the change of temperature in trans-\nformers has no effect on the furfural content in oil. This\nresult placed an end to the arguments on whether temperature\ninﬂuences the furfural content in insulation oil. What’s more,\nthe moisture content of insulation oil in ﬁeld transformers\nare always below 10 ppm, which is lower than the moisture\ncontent in the oil used in this paper. No decrease of furfural\ncontent in Figure 3 also indicates that trace moisture in oil has\nTABLE 3. Initial furfural content in experiment without copper or oxygen.\nFIGURE 3. Results of furfural content at different temperatures.\nFIGURE 4. Variation of furfural content in experiments with copper.\nno effect on the furfural content, thus this factor is neglected\nin this paper.\nFor the experiments containing copper bar, the initial fur-\nfural contents and variation trends are shown in Table 4 and\nFigure 4, respectively, which shows that the furfural contents\nremain constant at 70 ◦C and 90 ◦C, but it slightly decreases\nat 110 ◦C and 130 ◦C. Furfural content at 110 ◦C decreases\nby almost 1 mg/L for 50 days, and it decreases by 3 mg/L\nat 130 ◦C. Compared with Figure 3, the decrease of furfural\ncontent is seemingly caused by copper.\nTABLE 4. Initial furfural content in experiment with copper.\nAnother simple repetitive experiment was performed at\n110◦C and 130 ◦C to conﬁrm the change of furfural content,\nthat is, only initial and ﬁnally furfural contents in oil were\nmeasured to avoid the interference of sampling. Three groups\nwere done at both temperatures, and the test results are shown\nin Table 5.\nTABLE 5. Furfural content test results.\nCompared with the results in Figure 4, the decline extent of\nfurfural content in repeated experiment apparently decreases,\n53490 VOLUME 7, 2019\nD. Fenget al.: Influential Factors and Correction Method of Furfural Content in Transformer Oil\nonly a 0.31–0.51 mg/L decline at 110 ◦C for 50 days. In these\ntwo experiments, the conditions of copper are the same. The\nonly difference is the times of sampling, in which a little air\nmay be brought in. If less air is injected into the tank in the\naging progress, then the decline extent is likely to ulteriorly\ndecrease. However, this is currently difﬁcult for the manu-\nfacturing industry given that the tanks work in such a high-\ntemperature condition. From another perspective, copper is\ngenerally a catalyst for reactions; hence, it cannot determine\nwhether the reaction is taking place, but only the reaction\nrate. Furfural remains stable at 90 ◦C with copper bars, thus\nfurfural can be stable in insulating oil with copper even in\nhigh temperatures.\nResults show that furfural can hardly be affected by cop-\nper at temperatures below 90 ◦C. The operating tempera-\nture of insulation oil in ﬁeld transformers is always roughly\n40◦C−70◦C, which is far below 90 ◦C such that copper\nscarcely affects the stability of furfural in oil. Certainly,\nfurfural content may be affected by copper in accelerating\nthermal aging experiments.\nB. EFFECT OF OXYGEN ON THE STABILITY OF FURFURAL\nFigure 5 present the measurement results of furfural contents\nin experiments with air. Furfural contents in oil decrease at all\nthese four temperatures, and the decline rates differ because\nof several factors. Temperature is the most apparent fac-\ntor affecting the decreasing rate, and increasing temperature\naccelerates the degradation of furfural with air. For example,\nin experiments without copper, furfural content decreases\n2.5 mg/L at 70 ◦C in 40 days, but it decreases almost 10 mg/L\nat 110◦C, which is four times the decline rate at 70 ◦C.\nFIGURE 5. Change of furfural content at different temperatures in\nexperiments with air (the marks are shown in Table 1. B denotes\nexperiment without copper, C denotes experiment with copper).\nCopper can accelerate the degradation rate of furfural in\nan atmosphere with oxygen, and this phenomenon is partic-\nularly evident in low temperature, where furfural content in\nexperiment with copper is signiﬁcantly lower than that with-\nout. When experimental temperature rises, the degradation\nrate of furfural is mainly affected by temperature, resulting\nin unapparent accelerating effect of copper at 130 ◦C. High\ntemperature and copper accelerate the degradation progress\nof furfural in insulation oil with the presence of air.\nIn the industry, the furfural is generally used to prepare\nfuroic acid with air at 50 ◦C−55◦C, and the main reaction\nis shown in Equation (1) [25]. Copper oxide is commonly\nused as a catalyst to speed up the reaction rate in the industry.\nTherefore, the oxygen in the air makes the furfural content in\noil decrease exactly.\n2 −FAL +O2\n50∼55◦\n−→2 −Furoic Acid (1)\nThe amount of substance of furfural and oxygen in each\ntank, calculated by Equation (2)–(3), is roughly 3.75 ∗10−4\nmol and 5 .625 ∗10−3 mol, respectively. The amount of\noxygen is considerably larger than the amount of furfural.\nThus, the reaction between furfural in oil with oxygen is\nfairly a slow process because the amount of oxygen is enough,\nwhereas the furfural content only decreased 2.5 mg/L at 70 ◦C\nin practice, which may be caused by low furfural content and\nlow oxygen content in oil.\n15 (mg/L)∗2.4L\n96g/mol =3.75 ∗10−4mol (2)\n0.6L ∗21%\n22.4L/mol =5.625 ∗10−3mol (3)\nwhere 96 g/mol is the molar mass of furfural, 21% is the\nproportion of oxygen in air, and 22.4 L/mol is the molar\nvolume of gas under a standard situation.\nFor ﬁeld transformers, the temperature of insulation oil\nis relatively low nearly 40 ◦C−70◦C. The furfural content\nshould not be inﬂuenced by temperature or copper according\nto the results. However, free breathing transformers connect\nwith the external environment through a respirator, and some\ngas exchange with the outside world may occur because of\nload change or some other reasons, which will introduce\nsome oxygen into transformer. Almost all the oxygen that\nintrudes into transformer may react with the furfural in oil\nduring the long operating time of transformers, leading to\nfurfural content decrease. Therefore, the furfural content in\nﬁeld-transformer oil is inaccurate to some extent.\nPrevious works veriﬁed that more than 90% of transform-\ners worldwide are free-breathing transformers [26]. Accord-\ning to the results, furfural content in oil is not an accu-\nrate assessment model for the aging extent of insulation\nsystem because the mass of oxygen cannot be measured.\nHowever, transformer can be inferred as facing a dramatic\naging progress or fault when furfural content is signiﬁcantly\nincreased in a short time because insufﬁcient time is available\nfor furfural to be reacted.\nThree groups of accelerating thermal aging experiments\nhave been conducted in laboratory with the tank in Figure 1 to\nshow the effect of oxygen on furfural analysis. All conditions\nare the same, except for the oxygen conditions (Table 6).\nThe aging progress can be described as follows: First, insu-\nlation paper and oil were dried at 90 ◦C/50 Pa for 48 h. Second,\nthe insulation paper was placed in the oil at 60 ◦C/50 Pa\nfor 24 h to obtain an oil-impregnated paper system. Third,\nVOLUME 7, 2019 53491\nD.

Differences on the three groups of experiments.\nthe oil–paper system was placed in a 130 ◦C thermostat to\nconduct accelerating thermal aging tests. Next, insulation oil\nand paper samples were taken out regularly for measurement.\nThe aging tanks in groups B and C were sealed in conditions\nshowed in Table 6, and all tanks in group A ∼C were returned\nto aging oven for continued aging test. Finally, the degree of\npolymerization (DP) values of the insulation paper and fur-\nfural content in oil were measured according to IEC 60450-\naml and IEC 61198, respectively. The mass ratio of the oil\nto paper is 20, and the initial moisture content of paper is\nroughly 1%. Figure 6 shows the test results of DP values and\nfurfural content in oil.\nFIGURE 6. Test results of DP values and furfural content in aging test.\n(a) DP values of paper. (b) Furfural content in oil.\nFigure 6 shows that, on the one hand, oxygen accelerates\nthe aging rate of insulation paper, especially in the middle\nperiod of aging; on the other hand, oxygen has a signiﬁcant\neffect on the furfural content in oil during the aging process.\nAlthough the decline rate of DP values is various in the\nmiddle period, the difference about the DP values is little\nwhen it ages to 50 days. The furfural content in oil decreases\nwith the increase of oxygen content. The furfural content in\ngroup A is always low in the entire progress, which is similar\nto the test results of furfural content in some ﬁeld transformer\n[20]. However, furfural contents in oil in groups B and C are\napparently large and the furfural content in group C is even\nnearly thrice that in group B upon reaching 50 days. Con-\nsidering that both groups B and C are sealed, all conditions\nare the same except oxygen content, thus the difference of\nfurfural content in oil cannot be caused by factors such as\nvolatilization and partitioning phenomena. The difference in\noxygen amount leads to distinct furfural content, resulting\nin a great difference on the relationship between DP values\nand furfural content in oil. Consequently, the aging evaluation\nmodel established by furfural content differs with oxygen\ncontent.\nFIGURE 7. Fitting results of aging tests about group A ∼C.\nThe test results are ﬁtted with classical Equation (4), and\nthe results are shown in Figure 7. The ﬁtting result of group B\nis close to the Chendong equation, whereas the result of group\nC is similar to the results obtained by Burton et al. [8]. The\nresult in group A is not adapted to this relationship and gets\na poor ﬁtting effect. The difference in ﬁtting results indicates\nthat the furfural evaluation model differ in different oxygen\nconditions, resulting in inaccurate aging assessment results\nwhen using the same furfural evaluation model. Therefore,\nthe furfural evaluation model for different oxygen conditions\nneeds to be re-established.\nlog(2 −FAL) =a +b ∗DP (4)\nAging evaluation result by furfural content is not precise\nfor furfural content in ﬁeld transformers may be affected\nby oxygen. It can be inferred that aging assessment results\nfor ﬁeld transformers are better than the real state owing\nto the loss of some furfural. Even so, the routine testing\n53492 VOLUME 7, 2019\nD.

(d) 130 ◦C.\nof furfural content is likewise meaningful. The partial fail-\nure or overheating of transformers leads to accelerating aging\nof insulation paper and produces a large amount of furfural.\nThe furfural content greatly increases during a short time,\nas time is insufﬁcient for oxygen to react with furfural. There-\nfore, the part failure of transformers or accelerated aging can\nbe recognized on condition that furfural content increases\nrapidly in practice.\nC. CORRELATION BETWEEN 2-FURFURAL AND FUROIC\nACID AT DIFFERENT CONDITIONS\nFigures 8(a) – (d) show the test results of furoic acid at\ndifferent temperatures without copper. Figure 8a shows that\nthe furoic acid content increases continually with the decrease\nof furfural content, and the sum of furfural and furoic acid\nis almost unchangeable. According to the conservation of\nmatter, we can conﬁrm that one molecule of furfural oxidizes\nup to one molecule of furoic acid, indicating that the sum of\nfurfural and furoic acid contents should be constant if the\nfurfural is completely converted to furoic acid. Therefore,\nfuroic acid is exactly the oxidation product of furfural at this\ntemperature. On the other hand, this result conﬁrms that the\noxygen in air is exact the cause of furfural degradation.\nHowever, with the increase of temperature, the oxidation\nproducts of furfural in insulation oil differ. When temperature\ngoes up to 90 ◦C, the sum of furfural and furoic acid contents\nslightly decline. This phenomenon is highly apparent at a\nhigh temperature, in which the sum of furfural and furoic\nacid contents quickly declines. Two reasons may explain\nthis situation: the ﬁrst one is that the degradation products\nof furfural changes. The second one is that the degradation\nproducts are still furoic acid, but the furoic acid is not stable\nat high temperature, or both. What can be conﬁrmed is that\nfuroic acid is not stable at high temperatures because furoic\nacid is produced at ﬁrst but disappears later at 130 ◦C.\nFigures 9(a)–(c) show the results of the furoic acid content\ntest at different temperatures with the acceleration of copper.\nFigure 9a shows that the sum of furfural and furoic acid\ncontents is still substantially stable, but the sum begins to\ndecrease at 90 ◦C (Figure 9b). A comparison of Figure 9b\nwith Figure 8b shows that copper accelerates furfural content\ndecline and those furoic acid content increases slowly at\nthe same time, thereby decreasing the sum of furfural and\nfuroic acid contents. Similarly, furoic acid increases ﬁrst but\ndeclines later despite furfural content decreasing sharply at\n110◦C. The sum of furfural and furoic acid contents gradu-\nally declines when temperature is more than 90 ◦C, and the\ndecreasing rate depends on temperature and copper.\nThe operating temperature of insulation oil in ﬁeld trans-\nformer is relatively low approximately 40 ◦C−70◦C, and the\noxygen content is much lower than that in experiment. It can\nbe inferred that the oxidation product of furfural at the oper-\nating temperatures is mainly furoic acid, which is relatively\nstable in these temperatures. Thus, furoic acid content in oil\ncan be measured as a reference to increase the accuracy of\nfurfural analysis.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 53493\nD.

(c) 110 ◦C.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe stability of furfural in insulation oil is studied through\nfurfural degradation experiments in different conditions. Fur-\nther, the degradation product of furfural is studied to explore\nthe correction method of furfural content affected by oxygen.\nThe experimental ﬁndings are listed as follows.\n(1) Without copper and oxygen, furfural remains stable\neven when temperature rises to 130 ◦C, indicating furfural\ndoes not degrade itself at the operating temperatures of trans-\nformers (<90◦C).\n(2) The copper in transformers has no effect on the furfural\nstability when oil temperature is less than 90 ◦C.\n(3) Oxygen from air is the degradation cause of furfural\nin oil, and high temperature and copper will accelerate this\nprogress. The furfural content in different oxygen conditions\ndiffer much during the aging progress, thus the application\nof furfural content for aging assessment has to consider the\noxygen conditions.\n(4) Furoic acid is the main product of furfural in oxygen\ncondition when oil temperature is less than 90 ◦C. Measuring\nthe furoic acid content in oil may be used as correction\nmethod when using furfural content to assess the aging extent\nof insulation paper in ﬁeld transformers.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A. J.
