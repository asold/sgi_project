This success has\nspurred interest in combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with\nLLMs to enhance their capabilities in understanding and modeling\ngraphs [6, 11, 15, 21, 23], including implementing LLMs as encoders\nto process features within GNNs [3, 5, 10, 22], and employing LLMs\nas aligners with GNNs to enhance performance [1, 20, 24].\nHowever, directly applying LLMs to graph modalities presents\nunique challenges due to the discrepancy and mismatch between\nthe graph and text modalities. For example, existing works primar-\nily map the graph into text, ignoring the irrelevant information\nand noises pertinent to the graphs. This oversight results in an\ninadequate understanding of crucial structural knowledge within\nthe graphs. Furthermore, the challenge is amplified when dealing\nwith large graphs containing thousands or millions of nodes and\nedges, as this complexity hinders LLMs’ ability to grasp intricate\nstructural information.\nThese limitations motivate our investigation into using a graph\nas a soft prompt encoded by GNNs for LLMs in graph learning\ntasks. The intuition behind this approach is that GNN are more\nproficient in aggregating and transforming information from the\nneighbourhood information, which could provide topological in-\nformation to LLMs. Additionally, it can guide the LLM in selecting\nrelevant information from textual input and control the generation\nprocess for token generation. Specifically, in this work, we aim to\nexamine the efficacy of a soft graph prompt in informing the LLM’s\npredictions. Hence, a natural yet pivotal research question arise:\nCan we soft prompt LLMs for graph leanring tasks?\nTo answer this question, we introduce GraphPrompter, a novel\nframework that combines the strength of GNNs and LLMs to pro-\ncess and comprehend graph-structured data. In particular, Graph-\nPrompter capitalizes on the frozen LLM as a robust feature extrac-\ntor that taps into its vast pretraining knowledge, thus enabling us\nto avoid extensive task-specific fine-tuning. In parallel, the GNN\nworks on the graph to produce node embeddings, which are later\nconcatenated with a prompt instruction to guide LLMs for graph\nlearning tasks. The LLM, due to its powerful autoregressive nature,\ngenerates a language response based on the fused graph and text\ninformation, effectively turning the LLM into a powerful tool for\ngraph understanding tasks. See Figure 1 for an illustration.\narXiv:2402.10359v2  [cs.LG]  16 Mar 2024\nWWW ’24 Companion, May 13–17, 2024, Singapore, Singapore. Zheyuan Liu, Xiaoxin He, Yijun Tian, and Nitesh V.

The process involves extracting a k-\nhop subgraph for each node, feeding it into a GNN followed\nby a projection layer. Simultaneously, the textual attributes\nassociated with each node are processed by the text embedder.\nThe resulting node embedding is then concatenated with text\nembeddings, serving as a soft prompt to guide the LLM for\ngraph learning tasks.\nThis hybrid approach is particularly suitable for graphs with\ntextual attributes (i.e., textual graphs), which requires an under-\nstanding of both the textual content and the graph structure, such\nas identifying the subcategory of an academic paper based on its\ncitation network and abstract. We experimentally demonstrate that\nour framework is capable of prompting LLMs for graph learning\ntasks on five benchmark datasets under node classification and\nlink prediction tasks. It showcases the potential for significant\nadvancements in the use of LLMs for complex data structures be-\nyond traditional text, opening up new avenues for research and\napplication in the realm of AI assistants capable of intricate graph\ncomprehension. Our main contributions are as follows:\n•To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first work\ninvestigating whether LLMs can understand graph learning\ntasks via soft prompting.\n•We propose GraphPrompter, a novel plug-and-play frame-\nwork that first employ GNN to get node representations\nfrom the textual graph. Then the obtained embeddings are\nconcatenated with a prompt instruction to guide LLMs for\ngraph learning tasks.\n•Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed framework under both node classification and link\nprediction tasks across various graph benchmarks.\n2 METHOD\nTo enhance the alignment of graph knowledge with LLM, we in-\ntroduce GraphPrompter, a plug-and-play pipeline that fuses post-\nprocessed node embeddings with LLMs. This integration is designed\nto leverage the rich semantic context LLMs provide, enhancing the\ninterpretability and utility of graph representations, as illustrated\nin Figure 1.\n2.1 Graph Section\nA graph can be represented as 𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐸 ), where 𝑉 is a set of\nvertices, and 𝐸is a set of edges. For each node𝑣𝑖 ∈𝑉, we define the\n3-hop subgraph 𝐺𝑠𝑖 as the induced subgraph containing all nodes\nwithin three hops from 𝑣𝑖. Subsequently, a GNN is employed to\ncompute the node embeddings 𝑋𝑖 for each of these subgraphs 𝐺𝑠𝑖 ,\nas follows:\n𝑋𝑖 = GNN(𝐺𝑠𝑖 )∈ R𝑑𝑔 , (1)\nwhere 𝑑𝑔 is the hidden dimension of the GNN. Each embedding\n𝑋𝑖 captures the structural information of the corresponding sub-\ngraph, providing a rich representation of the topological features\nassociated with 𝑣𝑖.\nWe employ a projection layer, specifically, a multilayer percep-\ntron (MLP), to align the node embedding with the vector space of\nthe LLM:\nˆ𝑋𝑖 = MLP(𝑋𝑖)∈ R𝑑𝑙 , (2)\nwhere 𝑑𝑙 is the hidden dimension of the LLM.\nBoth the GNN and the projection layer are trained in an end-to-\nend manner, ensuring that the embeddings 𝑋𝑖 are discriminative\nfor the downstream task. The rationale behind this approach is\ntwofold: first, to leverage the GNN’s inherent capacity to aggregate\nand transform local neighborhood information into meaningful\nembeddings; and second, to enable the subsequent integration with\nthe LLM, which interprets these embeddings as a soft prompt in\nconjunction with textual data.\n2.2 LLM Section\nAfter encoding the graph structure, the GraphPrompter proceeds to\nprocess the textual information associated with each node. This is\nwhere the power of the LLM comes into play, as it is kept frozen\nfor efficient fine-tuning while preserving the LLM’s pre-trained\nknowledge. For each node 𝑣𝑖, given its associated textual attribute\n𝑇𝑖 (e.g., title and abstract of a paper in a citation graph), we tokenize\n𝑇𝑖 using the frozen tokenizer of the LLM as follows:\n𝑇tokens = Tokenizer(𝑇𝑖). (3)\nThe tokenizer converts the text into a sequence of discrete tokens\n𝑇tokens in the LLM’s vocabulary. Subsequently, these tokens are\nthen embedded into a continuous space:\n𝑇emb = Embed(𝑇tokens)∈ R𝑀×𝑑𝑙 , (4)\nwhere 𝑀 is the sequence length and 𝑑𝑙 is the hidden dimension of\nthe LLM. These embeddings are designed to capture the semantic\nmeaning of the text, complementing the structural information\nprovided by the GNN.\nNext, we concatenate the node embeddings and the text em-\nbeddings, denoted as [ˆ𝑋𝑖,𝑇emb], which will go through the self-\nattention layers in the LLM as usual.\nThe motivation for this step is to ensure that the LLM can process\nthe rich semantic content of the text alongside the graph embed-\ndings. By encoding the text attributes into a compatible format, we\naim to capitalize on the LLM’s advanced understanding of natural\nlanguage, which is crucial for tasks that require a combination of\nstructural and textual data interpretation, such as node classifica-\ntion in citation networks. Here, we point out the key distinction\nbetween node classification and link prediction: node classification\nCan we Soft Prompt LLMs for Graph Learning Tasks?

Specifically, our experiments\naim to address the central question: Can we soft prompt LLMs\nfor graph learning tasks?\n3.1 Experiment setups\n3.1.1 Datasets and baseline models.Our experiments mainly\nfocus on node classification and link prediction using various graph\nbenchmarks: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Ogbn-arxiv, and Ogbn-products.\nFor Ogbn-products, given its substantial scale of 2 million nodes and\n61 million edges, we have employed a node sampling strategy to\nobtain a subgraph containing 54k nodes and 74k edges. We compare\nour approach with three kinds of baseline models: 1) Pure GNN; 2)\nFrozen LLM, which includes zero shot and soft prompt tuning; and\n3) Tuned LLM with LoRA. We employ the LLAMA2-7B [16] as the\nLLM backbone. For the pure GNN method, we use GAT [17]. In the\nLLM-frozen setting, for zero-shot, we use a frozen LLM for direct\nnode classification/edge prediction using textual attributes of the\nnodes. In soft prompt tuning, we keep the parameters of the LLM\nfrozen and adjust only the prompt. In LLM-tuned, the original LLM\nparameters are updated for downstream tasks by utilizing LoRA.\n3.1.2 Implementation Details.We report the mean of five inde-\npendent runs with different seeds. The experiments are conducted\non 2 A100 GPUs (80GB).\n4 EXPERIMENTS RESULT\nTo answer the central question, we conduct experiments across\nvarious graph benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the effec-\ntiveness of GraphPrompter. The performance is reported in Table 1\nand Table 2.\n4.1 Node Classification Task\nIn Table 1, we present the results of node classification experi-\nments conducted on a variety of benchmark datasets, where both\nMethod Cora Citeseer Pubmed Ogbn-arxiv Ogbn-products\nNode Classification Accuracy (%)↑\nGAT 84.69 70.78 84.09 71.82 70.52\nZero-Shot 43.31 29.22 91.39 44.23 15.05\nSoft Prompt Tuning 70.31 70.97 91.45 71.99 75.14\nFine-tuning + LoRA 75.97 73.45 94.68 74.58 78.99\nSubgraph Prompt Tuning80.17 72.29 93.84 75.04 75.30\nGraphPrompter+ LoRA 80.26 73.61 94.80 75.61 79.54\nTable 1: Node classification result of our proposed Graph-\nPrompter, with a number of baselines under various graph\nbenchmarks: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Ogbn-arxiv and Ogbn-\nproducts. For each model, we present the mean accuracy\nfrom five independent runs, with both the title and abstract\nof papers provided as input along with specific instructions.\nBold indicates the best performance and underline indicates\nthe runner-up.\ntitle and abstract information are provided to LLM alongside de-\ntailed instructions. As it can be seen from the table, the integration\nof the proposed method (GraphPrompter) with LoRA consistently\nsurpasses the performance of other baseline methods across di-\nverse benchmarks. In particular, GraphPrompter with LoRA in the\nPubMed and Citeseer datasets with top accuracies of 94.80 % and\n73.61 %, respectively. The naive fine-tuning with LoRA approach\ntypically appears as the runner-up and has small performance gap\nwith GraphPrompter. Though subgraph prompt tuning approach\nhas relatively close accuracy score with naive fine-tuning, it still\nnot as effective as fine-tuning on node classification task. Further-\nmore, we observe that zero-shot generally ranks lowest in perfor-\nmance across all benchmark datasets, with the exception of PubMed\ndataset. This reflects the limitation of LLMs in capturing graph\nknowledge without the auxiliary processing provided by GNNs.\nAdditionally, two distinct experimental setups are illustrated in Fig-\nure 2, where Figure 2a encompasses both title and abstract within\nthe node embeddings, and Figure 2b restricts the node embeddings\nto only the title. The comparative analysis illustrated in the figures\nfurther illustrates the superior average performance of the proposed\nmethod (GraphPrompter), which combines subgraph prompt tuning\nand GraphPrompter, in comparison to other baseline approaches,\nspecifically soft prompt tuning and fine-tuning methodologies.\n4.2 Link Prediction Task\nIn Table 2, we present the results of link prediction experiments\nconducted on a variety of benchmark datasets, where only the title\nis provided to LLM. As seen in Table 2, subgraph prompt tuning\napproach consistently surpasses baseline models in link prediction\ntasks on various benchmarks. It shows remarkable performance\nespecially on the Citeseer dataset, achieving a 93.49 % accuracy\nrate. GraphPrompter + LoRA is usually the runner-up model for the\nmajority case. Notably, similar to node classification task, the Zero-\nShot approach generally scores lowest, underscoring the necessity\nof GNN integration for LLMs to effectively process and understand\ngraph data. It is notable that under both node classification and link\nprediction, GraphPrompter can continue outperforming traditional\nGNN and soft prompting techniques. This observation indicates\nthat GraphPrompter, is particularly adept at capturing and utilizing\nthe complex intersection between graph components and textual\ninformation, leading to a better performance on various graph\nrelated tasks.\nWWW ’24 Companion, May 13–17, 2024, Singapore, Singapore.

Here, we summarize the key findings:\n•Performance Benchmark: Overall, our proposed method\nranks either as the best or runner-up across all benchmark\ndatasets for both tasks. This consistently high performance\naffirms a positive response to our central question: we can\neffectively soft prompt for LLMs in graph learning tasks.\n•Methodological Superiority : The fine-tuning approach,\nwhile competitive, displayed a marginal performance gap\nwhen compared to GraphPrompter. This indicates that while\ntraditional fine-tuning remains effective, the specialized soft\ngraph prompt tuning strategy designed for graph data offers\na more potent solution for enhancing LLM’s graph learning\ncapabilities.\n•Challenges with Zero-Shot Learning : The zero-shot ap-\nproach consistently ranked the lowest across all benchmarks\nfor both tasks. This reflects the challenges LLMs face in\ncomprehending graph structure and semantics, highlighting\nthe necessity for tailored approaches like GraphPrompter in\ngraph learning tasks.\n6 CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, our study reveals the significant potential of leverag-\ning LLMs for interpreting graph structures through a prompt tuning\nmethodology. To facilitate this study, we presentsGraphPrompter,\na novel plug-and-play framework that integrates the capabilities\nof Large Language Models with the structural insights of Graph\nNeural Networks for the task of node classification and link pre-\ndiction in graph data. Specifically, GraphPrompter consists of two\nsections: the graph section utilizes GNN for structural insights,\nwhile the text section applies LLM to interpret node-related textual\ndata. Extensive experiments and in-depth studies demonstrate the\nsuperiority of GraphPrompter across multiple benchmark datasets.\nFuture work could focus on extending our pipeline to other more\ncomplex graph level tasks.\nREFERENCES\n[1] William Brannon, Suyash Fulay, Hang Jiang, Wonjune Kang, Brandon Roy, Jad\nKabbara, and Deb Roy. 2023.
