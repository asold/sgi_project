  "abstract": "As modern technologies, particularly home assistant devices, become more integrated into our daily lives, they are also making their way into the domain of energy management within our homes. Homeowners, now acting as prosumers, have access to detailed information in 15-minute or even 5-minute intervals, including weather forecasts, outputs from Renewable Energy Sources (RES)-based systems, appliance schedules and the current energy balance, which details any deficits or surpluses along with their quantities and the predicted prices on the Local Energy Market (LEM). The goal for these prosumers is to reduce costs while ensuring their home’s comfort levels are maintained. However, given the complexity and the rapid decision-making required in managing this information, the need for a supportive system is evident. This is particularly true given the routine nature of these decisions, highlighting the potential for a system that provides personalized recommendations to optimize energy consumption, whether that involves adjusting the load or engaging in transactions with the LEM. In this context, we propose a recommendation system powered by Large Language Models (LLM), Scikit-llm and Zero-Shot Classifiers, designed to evaluate specific scenarios and offer tailored advice for prosumers based on the available data at any given moment. Two scenarios for a prosumer of 5.9 kW are assessed using candidate labels, such as Decrease, Increase, Sell and Buy.",
