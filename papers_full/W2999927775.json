Introduction  \nDuring the last years, smar t technologies have become a part of ou r everyday life (Crist ol & Gimbert, 2013). \nCorrespondingly, with the aim to improve students’ learning experiences and outcomes, educators have started \ndeveloping learning environment benefiting from students’ devices/technologies. Thus, students are asked to bring \ntheir own devices (BYOD) to be used for teaching and learning purposes. As reported in several studies, students’ \niPads, laptops, tablets and smartphones have been used in students’ daily learning at the classroom and learning \nsettings (Kay & Schellenberg, 2019). Particularly, there is a high growth rate of the use of BYOD model in Higher \nEducation (HE). It is argued that allowing students to us e their own devices i.e. smartphones and iPads, can be a \nuseful learning tool to increase interaction during th e lectures’ time (Aldiab, Chowdhury, Kootsookos, Alam, & \nAllhibi, 2019; McClean & Crowe, 2017). However, the use of such technology needs an adoption of appropriate \npedagogies (Emery, 2012; Santos & Bocheco, 2017). Furthermore, students need to have more opportunities to \ncollaborate and react as active agents in the learning settings (Daniela, Vi svizi, Gutiérrez-Braojos, & Lytras, \n2018). \nIn order to stimulate students to involve in a learning activity, instructors’ pedagogical actions are very important \nto utilize the affordances of learni ng tools and learning environment (John & Sutherland, 2005). Accordingly, \ninstructors need to know how to orchestrate interactive actions between them and their students with the support of \nthe features of these learning tools (Hakami, 2013; Kapur & Bielaczyc, 2012). This potential interaction may not \ntake place if a learning tool is perceived as a presentational tool only (Armstrong et al., 2005). Hence, the role of a \nfaculty in the class needs to be changed from providing knowledge to encouraging learners to involve in active \ntasks during the lecture time (McClean & Crowe, 2017; Siani, 2017). \nIt is reported that for active learning to be applied in higher education, faculty members need to see technology as \na tool to promote their teaching and students’ learning (Şahin, Muhammed, Kurban, Caroline Fell, & Mazur, 2019). \nActive learning can be defined as any learning approach th at allows students to do an active learning task and \nencourage them to think about the activities they are involving in (Matsushita, 2017). In other words, the student \npractices working, talking, and receiving during the class, which can be used  to discriminate between active and \npassive learning (Johnson, Johnson, & Smith, 1998). Doing so, a new paradigm of learning would be needed to \nengage students in active tasks in the class. It is argu ed that BYOD can serve as a supportive educational tool \njel.ccsenet.org Journal of Education and Learning V ol. 9, No. 1; 2020 \n120 \n(Cheng, Guan, & Chau, 2016). Especially, as indicated in several studies, most students are happy to use their own \ndevices for such activities inside/outside the classroom (McClean & Crowe, 2017). Moreover, as being reported by \nstudents, using BYOD model helps them to interact more with each other in the class (Murillo-Zamorano, López \nSánchez, & Godoy-Caballero, 2019). \nAs indicated by Nikou and Economides (2018), the results of several studies focusing on the effectiveness of \nmobile learning suggest that mobile learning has the opportunity to improve students’ learning achievements, \nmotivation and attitudes. Safar (2018) identifies the effe ct of using BYOD model on students’ learning in a \nblended learning classroom at Kuwait University (KU). The study shows that BYOD intervention has a significant \npositive impact on students’ learning achievements based on students’ improvement test scores. Moreira et al. \n(2017) evaluate the use of mobile technologies in higher education institutions of the north region in Portugal \nbetween 2009 and 2015. They find that mobile technologies were mostly us ed as a tool rather than as a teaching \nand learning approach. They suggest th at instructors should apply mobile-l earning in such ways that increase \ncollaborative learning between students inside/outside the classroom. In a study at the Fujairah Higher Colleges of \nTechnology Foundations Program in the Fujairah Men’s College (FMC) and Fujairah Women’s College (FWC) in \nthe United Arab Emirates, Ali (2015) investigates how instructors and students use the iPad’s technical \naffordances to create pedagogical affo rdances designed to construct and promote English language teaching and \nlearning. The data were collected from 14 instructors and 194 students who participated in a survey, observation of \nsix classes, and an interview of five instructors. The study shows that based on the portability of the iPad and its \nuser-friendly functions, instructors and students use iPad to facilitate collaborative learning activities. \nHowever, BYOD model offers a solution for some aspects which hinder improving learning environment; it also \nbrings some challenges that hinder its effective implementa tion in the learning environment. It is reported that \nBYOD could disrupt students’ learning because students sometimes use their devices to perform non-content \nrelated activities. For example, they can read/send/repl ay text messages or browse the non-relevant websites \n(Santos & Bocheco, 2017). Another obstacle is that some students may not be able to bring a high-quality device to \nthe classroom (Kay & Schellenberg, 2019). Yet, BYOD’s portability, ease of use, small investment cost and the \npotential impact on improving students’ learning is beneficial characteristics which lead educators to apply it in \nHE. Still, one of the most challenges for instructors to de al with in a large class is how to control and engage \nstudents in learning activities during the class. \nIn short, to increase students’ interactions, instructors are recommended that ther e is a need to develop learning \nactivities that rely on students’ personal devices and that students should be encouraged to involve in these \nactivities when needed (Santos & Bocheco, 2017). To do so, some educators have integrated BYOD with \napplications that make the students’ interac tion easy during classes i.e., the Nearpod (Nearpod  is a web-based \nlearning application that facilitates and controls inter activities during the learning experience settings. For more \ninformation please see https://nearpod.com/l/higher-ed/) (Sanmugam, Selvarajoo, Ramayah, & Lee, 2019). Mattar \n(2018) indicates that one of the main advantages of using the Nearpod is to support active learning in the classroom \nsince Nearpod offers different types of ways to engage stud ents in the class. Thus, Nearpod is seen as one of the \napps. that would increase interactivities and collaboration in the classroom (Dong, Kavun, Senteney, & Ott, 2018). \nSince it allows instructors/lecturers to synchronise, present and control materials such as slides and videos during \nthe class time. Also, Nearpod reports student activities during the class, which allows instructors to analyze \nlearning progress. Moreover, it can enhance students’ learning experiences and increase students’ satisfaction to \ntheir learning because it gives students more opportunities to involve in learning activities and dynamic interaction \nbetween them (Jing & Yue, 2016). \n2. Study Background and Context \nIn the Saudi education system, males and females study in separate campuses. This gender segregation is based on \nIslamic values and Saudi culture. Normally, most lectures are delivered by female lecturers at the female campus. \nHowever, due to lack of female lecturers to cover all courses, some lectures have to be taught by male lecturers. To \ndeal with this issue, a video-conference system (closed-circuit television) is being provided to support \ncommunication with female students in their campus by creating several units of the system in the male campus. \nEach unit of the system consists of a PC, a sound system, a document camera (doc-cam) and a video camera with a \none-way video and a two-way audio broadcast. Sharoura College of Science and Arts, Najran University is one of \nthose colleges using this system in KSA. At the time of this study, 5 units of the system are being connected to 5 \nclassrooms at the female campus, which are provided with  a sound system and a data show in each class. These \nunits are being used to cover all lectures taught by male faculty members and allow them to convey lecture \nmaterials into female classrooms. The lecture materi als can be a website, show slides, graphics, photos, \nhand-written notes, video or audio clips, etc.  \njel.ccsenet.org Journal of Education and Learning V ol. 9, No. 1; 2020 \n121 \nTo facilitate communication between lecturers and their fema le students, each lecturer gets assistance from the \nwomen’s section, which helps him in controlling the class and monitoring the absence of female students. \nHowever, as reported in a previous study by the resear cher, frequent technical problems and sound unclarity are \nregarded as the most barriers to instructors’ use of the system in their teaching (Hakami, 2017). Although there is \nonly one microphone in the classroom in the women’s section which allows female students to ask and answer \nquestions, it is difficult to hear the questions asked by students in the back of the class. Moreover, the echo sound \nmakes it more difficult for both lecturers and students to ask/listen to questions. In fact, teaching via this system is \nquite challenging especially in large classes because it is difficult to control the class and run active learning tasks. \nThus, it is difficult for a lecturer to control students’ discussions during the class time. Moreover, the lecturer needs \nto recognize student’s voice or to keep asking, “Please, tell me your name” in order to know the name of the \nstudent who asks/answers a question, which wastes class’s time. \nThe main challenge of promoting active learning in a female class, as indicated above, is that all lectures are taught \nby male instructors to the female students through video-conference learning system with no physical interaction \nbetween the lecturers and their female students. It beco mes more challenging when lecturing in a large class. \nTypically, the number of female students in each course ta ught via the video-conference system does not exceed \n30. However, due to the lack of lectures in the summer semester of 2019, the number of female students enrolled in \nsome courses rose up to 74. Accordingly, Nearpod is considered one of the solutions that could increase the \nstudents’ interaction. Therefore, it can support learning resources and content across students’ smartphones, tablets, \nand laptops which enable students to actively participate and interact in spite of being applied in large classrooms \n(McClean & Crowe, 2017). \nHence, the author combined a “BYOD” model with the Nearpod to create a new learning environment aiming to \nease delivering teaching materials and to increase interactivity in the class. In doing so, the author encouraged \nstudents to bring their personal smartphones or laptops into the classroom, and used Nearpod to deliver learning \nmaterials through these devices. The aim was to utilize the affordances of both tools to create a supportive learning \nenvironment. Thus, the Nearpod affordan ces were used for two reasons: first,  to increase the interactivity of the \nlearning environment by involving female students in active learning tasks, asking them to answer different types \nof questions and easily collecting their responses during the classes. Second, they were used to monitor and control \nstudents’ activities since Nearpod allows lecturer to pr esent a specific content and control students’ devices. \nHowever, BYOD model allows students to use their own devices in order to respond to lecturers’ instructions. At \nthe same time, since Nearpod does not offer audio conversations service to communicate with learners, the \nvideo-conference system was used to broadcast the lect ure to all students, communicate with a female student \nwhen needed and present written/printed notes to the entire class via the doc-cam attached to the system. \nThe course name was School Administration and 74 female students were enrolled. The objective of the course \nwas to identify the basic concepts of leadership and develop the abilities and understanding of decision makers to \nrun any educational institutions. Being taught in the summer semester, the course took only 7 weeks from 9 June to \n26 July, 2019. The Nearpod was used almost used to provi de a third of the lectures especially when there was a \nneed to involve students in discussions and problem-solving tasks.  \nThe free version of Nearpod does have limited number of students to join a class session. Thus, the author’s \naccount was upgraded to the Nearpod Platinum Edition to allow 74 students to participate in the learning activities \nduring the class time. By using the N earpod features, the author converted the designed PowerPoint slides and \nPDFs into Nearpod classs format and created new ones. In  order to promote students’ interests and enrich their \nunderstanding of the course topics, the author review ed class Martials and added learning activities, e.g., \nopen-ended questions, quizzes, draw it, and collaborate, multiple choice quizzes, short answers and polls to each \none. During each class, the author used his own laptop to run the Nearpod to present and control learning content \nand activities while simultaneously using the video-conf erence system to communicate verbally with female \nstudents to explain the learning content and give instructions for every learning activity. Benefiting from Nearpod \nfeatures, the author also kept monitoring students’ responses to each learning activity during the classes. \nFurthermore, by the end of each class, a report on students’ participation and performance during each session was \nsaved to be used later for course evaluation.  \n3. Study Design  \nIn the light of the growing body of research evidences that active learning has a positive impact on students’ \nlearning outcomes and experiences (Auerbach, Higgins, Brickman, & Andrews, 2018; Cavanagh et al., 2018; \nPrince, 2004), in this study, a learning environment was developed in order to increase students’ interaction during \nthe class. Accordingly, Nearpod was used to manage learning contents on students’ smartphones. At the same time, \njel.ccsenet.org Journal of Education and Learning V ol. 9, No. 1; 2020 \n122 \nthe video-conference system was used for verbal discussions with female students during the class. The contents \nwere a combination of presentations, collaboration activitie s, and real time assessment activities. Therefore, the \nmain objective of this study is to identify the extent  of using the Nearpod in a BYOD learning environment \nincreases/hinders active learning through answering the following research question:  \n- Do Nearpod affordances promote female students’ interaction in a BYOD learning environment? \nTo this end, a case study approach was viewed as an appropriate framework to guide this study (Yin, 2003). Hence, \nquantitative research was considered an appropriate method to explore students’ view about the effectiveness of \nthe designed learning environment to promote active learning. Bryman (2012) revealed that, by answering “what” \nquestions and explore opinions, research results can be enriched when using quantitative methods to address the \nresearch questions. Accordingly, the researcher designed a questionnaire to obtain students’ perspectives towards \nthe effectiveness of learning activities and practices, ch allenges and limitations when Nearpod being integrated \nwith BYOD model and the video-conference system.  \nThe study questionnaire consisted of four sections, namely, general information, students’ opinions about Nearpod \nusage in the integrated learning environment, a compar ison between video-conference usages alone and when \nintegrated with the Nearpod, and general advantages/dis advantages. The second and the third sections used a \n5-point Likert Scale, ranging from “s trongly disagree” to “strongly agree” to rate female students’ views about \neach item. The fourth section consisted of 5 open-ended questions aiming to provide a rich information about the \nadvantages/disadvantages of using the Nearpod when integrated with video-conference learning system. The \nquestionnaire was reviewed and evaluated by two expert s and approved it after considering their comments. The \nstudy took place at Sharoura College of Science and Arts, Najran University. All students who enrolled to ‘school \nadministration’ course took part in the study at the summer semester for the academic year 2018/2019. By the end \nof the semester, the questionnaire link was sent to all fe male students enrolled in the course: only 69 out of 74 \nstudents participated in the questionnaire with a 92% response rate.  \n4. Data Analysis  \nData was analysed using descriptive statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics consisted of frequency, percentages, \nmeans and standard deviation related to questions/items using Excel software. The responses to the open-ended \nquestions were collected in a word document and comme nts from each participant were grouped under one title: \n“ST” followed by the questionnaire number e.g., ST01 indicates the comments obtained from the first \nquestionnaire. Then, the researcher inductively started reading the data looking for similarities and differences and \nmaking notes of the key ideas. A list of codes was created whereas some codes were revised/deleted. \nFor reliability analysis, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was co mputed for the five Likert Scale items in section 2 \nwhich elicited students’ perspective about Nearpod usage when integrated with video-conference learning system \nand section 3 which measured students’ perspective to wards Nearpod, BYOD platfo rm, and video-conference \nlearning system. In both sections, the coefficients were greater than 0.75 indicating a positive reliability. The value \nof the the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.98 for overall 22 items of both sections. For section 2 (13 items), the value of the \nCronbach’s alpha was 0.9 whereas, for section 3, the value of the Cronbach’s alpha of the three positive items was \n0.88 and 0.85 for the six negative items.  \n5. Results and Discussions \nThe qualitative data obtained from open-ended questions indicated that most students were satisfied with the \nNearpod usage and its integration with video-conference  learning system when using their own devices in the \nclass.  \nTable shows that the mean score for the total sample of female students’ responses regarding Nearpod usage in the \nclass was 3.97, indicating that students perceived the Nearpod as a learning tool which could support their learning \nin the class when integrated with video-conference l earning system. The female students also had a positive \nattitude towards Nearpod usage when integrated with video-conference learning system. They did not have \nnegative attitudes towards Nearpod usage, BYOD platform and video-conference learning system as explained by \nthe median at 3 and mean at 2.72. Also, most female students “agreed” with the positive items with an average \nmean 3.89. In other words, students agreed with all po sitive items and did not agree with negative items which \nindicate that female students were satisfied with Nearpod usage in the class. ST09 reported that “ I hope this \napplication to be used in all courses supported with video-conference learning system”. ST20 also added, “I hope \nother applications, like this one, to be used in order to support learning in the class”.  \n \n \njel.ccsenet.org Journal of Education and Learning V ol. 9, No. 1; 2020 \n123 \nTable 1.

As shown in Table 2,  90% of the students agreed that \nNearpod usage increased the in teractivity in the class. Moreover, 91% of the students reported they had the \nopportunity to work with other students during the classs’ time. Likewise, 84% of the students reported they liked \nsharing their answers with other students in the class. As explained by ST44, “the most useful thing I liked in using \nthe Nearpod in class is sharing my view and discussing it with other students”.  \n \nTable 2. Percentage of students’ responses towards Nearpod usage during classs  \nN Items Agree \n(%) \nNatural \n(%) \nDisagree \n(%) \n1 Students had more opportunities to work together  91 4 5 \n2 The level of interactivity in  the class increased 90 3 7 \n3 Using the Nearpod’s collaborative activities t ools increased my understanding  87 3 10 \n4 Asking various questions helped me to understand things better 85 10 5 \n5 I liked sharing my answer with the class. 84 11 5 \n6 The diversity of learning resources increased my understanding of the lectures 84 3 13 \n7 The way of controlling activities and learning mate rials helped me to be more involved in the \nlearning process \n83 8 9 \n8 The lectures are explained better 83 6 11 \n \nTable 2 reveals that the students regarded the integration of the Nearpod as a tool or a learning environment can \nimprove their understanding of the lectures. In other words, the affordance of the Nearpod helped to increase the \nlevel of interaction among students and with their instructor, which supported their understanding of the subjects \ntaught. For 87% of the students indicated that the Nearpod’s collaborative activities tools increased their \nunderstanding of the classs. Similarly, 84% of the students reported that th e diversity of learning resources had \nincreased their understanding of th e lectures. ST34 indicated that “ using this App helps to understand lecture \nbetter by controlling discussions and questions”. This view was reported by 85% of the students who indicated that \nasking various questions during the class time helped them to understand things better. This may explain why 83% \nof the students reported that the lectures were taught better when the Nearpod was integrated with \nvideo-conference learning system. As indicated by Dong et al. (2018), Nearpod can be used to support instructors \nto involve students in active learning by presenting different learning tasks and learning materials.  \n5.2 Students’ Perceptions Towards the Integration of Nearpod with Video-Conference System  \nTable 3 shows that most female students did not have negative attitudes towards using technologies during the \nclasss’ time. However, less than a quarter to almost one third of the students had negative attitudes towards using \ntechnologies in general, and Nearpod and the video-conf erence learning system duri ng the lectures. One reason \nmight be that the integration of Nearpod did not tackle  all the issues that hindered learning via using the \nvideo-learning system. For example, ST11 reported that “the Nearpod is helpful, but the internet speed and the \nclarity of sound need to be fixed”. ST07 also emphasi sed that the sound in the class was the most obstacle \ndistracting their learning. Another reason was that although the Nearpod increased the level of interactivities in the \nclass, this level remained lower compared with the physical interaction between students and their instructors. This \nalso might explain why 32% of female students did not like using new technologies during the lecture. As ST04 \nsaid “I don’t like learning through the video-conference learning at all”.  \n \n \n \n \njel.ccsenet.org Journal of Education and Learning V ol. 9, No. 1; 2020 \n124 \nTable 3.

However, as \nshown in Table 4, a few students did not love using their own devices in the classroom for learning purposes. \nMoreover, more than three thirds of the students reported they enjoyed learning when using the Nearpod in the \nclass. As McClean and Crowe (2017) concluded that students liked using their own devices to run learning \nactivities during classs’ time. Furthe rmore, most students did not mind sharing their own devices with her \ncolleagues as reported by 75% of the students.  \n \nTable 4.

This leads students to decide which apps can be used to support teaching in all courses, especially those \nones taught by video-conference learning system. ST13 reported “The video-conference learning system is an old \nsystem; the Nearpod and other modern Apps should be used to support teaching and learning in all subjects”. This \nresult is consistent with the findings reported by other researchers who confirmed that Nearpod made their classs \nmuch easier compared to other app presentations (Gallegos & Nakashima, 2018; Lowry-Brock, 2016; Siani, \n2017). \n6. Conclusion  \nThe present study aims to identify female students’ pers pectives about the Nearpod us age when integrated with \nvideo-conference learning system in a BYOD lear ning platform. The study took place at Sharoura \nCollege of Science and Arts, Najran University in the summer semester of the academic year 2018/2019. In order \nto achieve the objectives of this study, a questionnaire was designed and applied to all female students enrolled in \nthe “School Administration” course.  \nThe current results generally show that the features of the Nearpod to present and ask questions (real-time \nassessment) were reported by students as the most things which encouraged them to involve in learning activities \nin the classroom. In addition, the way how the Nearpod controls materials helped me as a lecturer and the students \nto facilitate performing the learning tasks during the lecturing time. The way of Nearpod to control learning \nactivities helped to engage all students in the class and control the learning materials presented to them. As \nindicated by McClean and Crowe (2017), Nearpod can be used to support instructors to involve students in active \nlearning by presenting different learning tasks and learning materials even in a large class. This result is in \nconsistence with the findings reported by other research ers who reported that Near pod made their classs much \neasier compared with other app presentations (Gallegos & Nakashima, 2018; Lowry-Brock, 2016; Siani, 2017). \nAs McClean and Crowe (2017) concluded that students liked using their own devices to run learning activities \nduring class, this study shows that students were satisfied with using their own devices for learning proposes. This \nfinding also supports what was reported by Song and Kong (2017) who concluded that BYOD platform was a \nuseful learning environment which could be used to promote teaching activities during the lectures’ time. In this \nstudy, this type of interactive system was preferred by the students because interaction and sharing knowledge had \nincreased. In addition, students were willing to share and use their devices for the learning purposes.  \njel.ccsenet.org Journal of Education and Learning V ol. 9, No. 1; 2020 \n125 \nIn brief, the results of the presen t study concluded that the affordances of the Nearpod and BYOD platform \npromote active learning during the lectures and students are willing to involve in this type of learning approach \nwith their own devices being used for such learning activities during classes. These findings have practical \nimplications for lecturers aiming to implement active learning in the learning settings. I argue that by \nunderstanding the affordances of such tools/learning envi ronment, it might be better to design a learning setting \nthat leads to improve teaching and l earning process. However, the role of  lecturer needs to be changed from \nproviding knowledge to facilitating students’ learning, taking into account the importance of using the appropriate \nlearning tools suitable for the learning setting. In doing so, more efforts need to be done by HE (Higher Education) \nto understand which emergent aspects should be taken into account in order to improve teaching and learning \nenvironment. Specifically, many researches need to be carried out to determ ine how the integration of a learning \ntool with BYOD platform could be used to promote active learning in higher education.  \nReferences  \nAldiab, A., Chowdhury, H., Kootsookos, A., Alam, F., & Allhibi, H.
