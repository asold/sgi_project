  "abstract": "This study uses deep learning methods to explore the Internet of Things (IoT) network intrusion detection method based on the CIC-IoT-2023 dataset. This dataset contains extensive data on real-life IoT environments. Based on this, this study proposes an effective intrusion detection method. Apply seven deep learning models, including Transformer, to analyze network traffic characteristics and identify abnormal behavior and potential intrusions through binary and multivariate classifications. Compared with other papers, we not only use a Transformer model, but we also consider the model’s performance in the multi-class classification. Although the accuracy of the Transformer model used in the binary classification is lower than that of DNN and CNN + LSTM hybrid models, it achieves better results in the multi-class classification. The accuracy of binary classification of our model is 0.74% higher than that of papers that also use Transformer on TON-IOT. In the multi-class classification, our best-performing model combination is Transformer, which reaches 99.40% accuracy. Its accuracy is 3.8%, 0.65%, and 0.29% higher than the 95.60%, 98.75%, and 99.11% figures recorded in papers using the same dataset, respectively.",
