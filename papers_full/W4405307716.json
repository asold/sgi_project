With the rise of urban\nunderground construction and escalating human activities disturbing strata and structures,\nground deformation disasters are becoming more frequent, representing significant threats to\npeople’s lives and property. Therefore, the assessment and prediction of these disasters, espe-\ncially in densely populated urban areas, is of paramount importance. In Hangzhou, ground\ndeformation disasters predominantly occur in the plains, influenced by a combination of geo-\nlogical, hydrological, and anthropogenic factors. Geologically, these areas feature extensive dis-\ntributions of sand layers, artificial fill, and Quaternary soft soil layers. Hydrologically,\nhistorical extensive groundwater extraction coupled with the abundant groundwater facilitated\nby ancient river channel distributions significantly impacts the region. Anthropogenically, this\nregion represents Hangzhou’s most economically developed area, characterized by large-scale\nurban construction, significant engineering loads, and a dense network of underground pipe-\nlines. Consequently, the primary ground deformation disasters in Hangzhou manifest as subsi-\ndence and collapses, each driven by distinct factors. Subsidence primarily results from\nextensive urban development and the prevalent distribution of Quaternary soft soil layers,\nwhich are susceptible to compression under structural loads. In contrast, collapses are primar-\nily triggered by the presence of artificial fill and the failure of underground pipelines, condi-\ntions that create voids and structural weaknesses in the subsurface, leading to sudden ground\nfailures. The evaluation and prediction of geological disasters require a thorough understand-\ning of susceptibility, which not only informs about the geological conditions but also facilitates\nthe proper zoning of the selected area [4–7] Nevertheless, relying solely on assessments of sin-\ngle disaster types may not fully encapsulate the geological safety of a region. Hence, a more\ncomprehensive approach that includes multiple disaster types is often adopted [8–10]. Tradi-\ntionally, assessments, particularly those addressing subsidence and collapse, have depended on\nknowledge-driven models like the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) [11–13]. Particularly for\ncollapse-related disasters, which occur over small areas, machine learning-based susceptibility\nassessments of such disasters are, to our knowledge, currently an unexplored area. This\nmethod involves subjective scoring by experts to assign weights to various indicators for sus-\nceptibility analysis [14–16]. Also, this approach especially prevalent in the evaluation of col-\nlapse-related disasters, which typically affect smaller regions and have not yet been extensively\nexplored through machine learning-based assessments. When assessing the relative weights of\ndifferent types of disasters within a specific area, the lack of learning samples means that reli-\nance on expert judgment is the only viable option.\nThe AHP method, although widely used for comprehensive disaster evaluations, increas-\ningly shows its limitations due to its heavy reliance on expert judgments [17]. This dependency\nintroduces subjectivity, potentially affected by emotional states or evaluator fatigue, especially\nwhen numerous criteria are involved. Consequently, the scientific community is gradually\nshifting towards data-driven models, which are adept at processing complex datasets and\nthereby enhance the accuracy of predictions. Unlike traditional models, data-driven models\nare capable of handling more complex datasets, thereby improving prediction accuracy. These\nmodels have proven particularly effective in analyzing susceptibility to large-scale disasters like\nlandslides and earthquakes [18–22]. Recent innovations have included the integration of vari-\nous machine learning models, such as combining Back Propagation (BP) neural networks with\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM), to capitalize on the strengths of each model while minimiz-\ning the weaknesses, thereby improving overall predictive performance [23,24]. However,\ndespite the advances in data-driven methodologies, the challenge of assigning relative weights\nto different types of disasters within specific areas remains largely unresolved without exten-\nsive historical and geological data. Currently, this aspect of disaster evaluation still often relies\nPLOS ONE\nGround deformati on susceptibility in Hangz hou\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03107 24 December 12, 2024 2 / 19\nFunding: The author(s) received no specific\nfunding for this work.\nCompeting interests : The authors declare that they\nhave no known competing financial interests or\npersonal relationships that could have appeare d to\ninfluence the work reported in this paper.\non the subjective judgments of experts, underscoring a significant gap that persists in compre-\nhensive disaster risk assessments. This gap highlights the ongoing need for developing meth-\nodologies that can integrate large-scale data analysis while accommodating the unique\ncharacteristics of various disaster types. Amid the progression of artificial intelligence technol-\nogy, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4 are being increasingly utilized in vari-\nous fields for data analysis [25–28]. Large language models (LLMs) are AI models crafted to\ncomprehend and produce human language. Trained with extensive text data, they excel in var-\nious tasks such as text summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, among others [29]. A\ndistinctive feature of LLMs is their immense scale, encompassing billions of parameters to\nlearn intricate language patterns. These models are generally based on deep learning architec-\ntures, such as transformers, facilitating impressive performance in diverse NLP tasks [30,31].\nLLMs such as ChatGPT-4 are capable of processing large text datasets, handling complex\ninformation quickly and accurately, unencumbered by human biases or fatigue. They can\nlearn from historical data to identify patterns and connections, enabling deeper and more\ncomprehensive analysis. Despite their application in fields such as medicine and biology for\ndata processing and replicating experiments [32–35]. LLMs have yet to be explored in geology\nfor assisting in data processing and professional judgments.\nThis study assesses the susceptibility of ground deformation disasters in commonly filled\nand silty areas in Hangzhou by employing machine learning models. It investigates the feasi-\nbility of utilizing coupled models over single models to enhance evaluation effectiveness, par-\nticularly providing a viable template for applying machine learning to small-scale, collapse-\ntype disasters. Additionally, the study introduces an innovative approach by using LLMs for\ndata processing and weight determination in the comprehensive evaluation process. Through\ncomparison with expert AHP evaluations, this research confirms the advantages of LLMs like\nChatGPT-4 in fast data processing, consistent judgment, and freedom from human subjective\nfactors, while concurrently analyzing its limitations and contrasting the judgment logic of\nChatGPT-4 with that of human experts. This marks the first application of LLM in the field of\ngeological data analysis and judgment, and it also underscores the potential of LLMs in pro-\ncessing data and augmenting or even replacing human judgment in geological fields. Our\nresearch process is illustrated in Fig 1.\nBackground and methods\nStudy area\nThe silty clay soil in Hangzhou City predominantly occupies the plain regions. These areas,\ncharacterized by accumulative, alluvial, and marine plains, are among the most representative.\nThis study selects the typical filled soil-silty clay region along the southern bank of the Qian-\ntang River in Binjiang District as its focus. We chose this study area with the aim of using it as\na model, so that our methods can be extended to the entire Hangzhou region in the future.\nThe study area spans 31.97 km\n2\nand includes significant urban infrastructure such as subways,\nexpressways, and elevated roads, indicating substantial human modifications. Geographically,\nit lies along the western boundary of the Xiaoshao Plain, bordered to the north by the Hang-\nzhou duplex hill and to the south by the Puyang River Plain. The terrain is primarily flat plains\ninterspersed with a few low hills, exhibiting clear geomorphological boundaries, flat topogra-\nphy, and a dense river network. The soil composition mainly includes sandy silty soil and silt,\nwith the sand and gravel layer buried at depths of approximately 35–50 meters. Human activi-\nties have significantly influenced the area, with high-rise structures typically utilizing sand-\ngravel layers or bedrock as their foundational stratum. The sedimentary composition primarily\nconsists of gray to dark gray silty mud clay and silty fine clay, characterized by pronounced\nPLOS ONE\nGround deformati on susceptibility in Hangz hou\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03107 24 December 12, 2024 3 / 19\nhorizontal stratification and high-water content. The Quaternary strata in this region are\nlargely from the lower Holocene, formed during the early Fuyang marine transgression, pre-\ndominantly through flood alluviation, and often manifest as river valley plains, river terraces,\nand other landforms. These strata are composed of well-sorted and rounded sand and gravel,\nwith a relatively loose structure and a thickness ranging from 2 to 12 meters. The geographical\nlocation of the selected area is shown in Fig 2.\nFig 1.

Additionally, these factors should be ana-\nlyzed deeply in combination with the geological and cultural features of the region. This com-\nprehensive approach ensures that assessments are not only accurate but also reflective of the\ndiverse influences impacting the area’s susceptibility to geological hazards. To determine\nwhich influencing factors are most associated with urban ground deformation disasters in\nHangzhou, we collaborated with experts from the Hangzhou urban geological safety assess-\nment at the Zhejiang Geological Survey. Based on field inspections and expert analyses, ground\ncollapses in the study area are primarily due to poor soil properties and damage to pipelines\ncaused by groundwater factors. Meanwhile, ground subsidence is mainly due to the study area\nbeing located in a plain, with the distribution of soft soil layers, human activities, and hydro-\nlogical factors being the primary reasons for ground subsidence occurrences. Given these fac-\ntors, we identified 9 key factors as preliminary evaluation indicators for urban ground\ndeformation disasters and conducted a correlation analysis to prevent issues such as overfitting\nor frequent misjudgments in the machine learning process, as depicted in the correlation heat-\nmap (Fig 3). The evaluation factors used for the disaster, data sources, and data attributes are\ndetailed in Table 1. For detailed maps of each evaluation factor, please refer to Fig 4.\nDeclaration of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing\nprocess\nDuring the preparation of this work, the author(s) used ChatGPT-4 to assist in comprehensive\nground disaster assessment by substituting human expert judgement with the AI’s capabilities\nFig 2.

The experts\ninvolved are well-acquainted with the situation in Hangzhou. As part of their tasks, the experts\nwere required to use the table in Fig 11 of the paper to assign scores, which involved the use of\nthe Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The cooperation with the experts was based on the\nproject requirements, specifically the needs of the work. Besides participating in scoring the\ntable, the experts did not take part in any other aspects of the paper.\nRandom forest—back propagation neural network coupling model\nTo improve the precision of models predicting ground collapse and mitigate the challenges\nposed by the limited size of disaster zones, which often results in a scarcity of data points, we\nrecommend employing a hybrid model combining Random Forest with Back Propagation\nNeural Network. Random Forest utilizes a collective method within machine learning, consist-\ning of multiple decision trees. Each tree operates on a randomized segment of the dataset and\nits features, which boosts the overall accuracy and robustness of the model. This technique is\nparticularly adept at processing varied inputs and identifying subtle patterns. To clarify how\nFig 4.

Eq (1)\nhighlights how Random Forest effectively reduces overfitting by incorporating diverse data\nsamples.\nGðSÞ ¼ 1 \u0000\nX\nn\ni¼1\np\n2\ni\nð2Þ\nWhere p\n2\ni\nindicates the proportion of the samples in set S that belong to class i, and n is the\ntotal number of classes. This measure is critical in determining the best split at each node\nwithin the trees. The Eq (2) not only allows Random Forest to handle a variety of input types\neffectively but also enhances its capability to detect subtle patterns in complex datasets.\nOn the other hand, the Backpropagation Neural Network stands out as a fundamental ele-\nment in machine learning, especially effective for tasks where linear methods fall short. It con-\nsists of several layers, each contributing to the network’s ability to refine its predictions\nthrough continuous adjustments to its parameters (weights and biases). To provide a clearer\ninsight into the learning mechanism of a Backpropagation Neural Network, we can examine\nspecific equations that detail this iterative process:\nW\nðnewÞ\nij\n¼ W\nðoldÞ\nij\n\u0000 Z\n@ L\n@ W\nij\nð3Þ\nWhere W\nðoldÞ\nij\nand W\nðnewÞ\nij\nare the old and new values of the weight between nodes i and j, η is\nthe learning rate, and\n@ L\n@ W\nij\nrepresents the gradient of the loss function L with respect to the\nweight W\nðnewÞ\nij\nEq (3) delineates the core mechanism by which the network learns by iteratively\nadjusting its weights.\ns xð Þ ¼\n1\n1 þ e\n\u0000 x\nð4Þ\nThe σ(x) function, known as the sigmoid activation function, is essential in neural networks\nfor normalizing inputs x to an output range between 0 and 1. This transformation is crucial as\nit allows the network to manage non-linear relationships in the data effectively. Eq (4) demon-\nstrates how the sigmoid function converts linear inputs into bounded outputs, enhancing the\nnetwork’s capability to address probabilistic decisions and complex non-linear phenomena.\nIntegrating the Random Forest and Backpropagation Neural Network results in a powerful,\nsynergistic model. The Random Forest begins the process by managing diverse inputs and lay-\ning the groundwork for the analysis. In our implementation, we have established two founda-\ntional models and a stacking classifier: The Random Forest Classifier includes 100 trees and\nuses a random seed of 42 to ensure consistency; the Neural Network Classifier features two\nhidden layers with 100 and 50 neurons, respectively, operates up to 1000 iterations, and main-\ntains the seed of 42 for repeatability. The Stacking Classifier then leverages these models as its\nbase, combining their predictions with an additional Random Forest of 100 trees serving as the\nfinal meta-model to solidify the decision-making process. This layered approach allows the\nBackpropagation Neural Network to further refine the analysis, enhancing the overall model’s\nPLOS ONE\nGround deformati on susceptibility in Hangz hou\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03107 24 December 12, 2024 8 / 19\ncapability to assimilate extensive data, distill key insights, and deliver accurate predictions. The\noperational framework of this ensemble model is illustrated in Fig 5.\nResults\nSusceptibility assessment\nIn this research, we utilized the \"Raster to Point\" function in ArcGIS to convert 27,898 data\npoints for ground subsidence susceptibility assessment, where susceptible regions were identi-\nfied based on regional cumulative subsidence data. For accurate model training, 70% of the\ndata were randomly selected for the training set via Python, ensuring robustness in ground\nsubsidence susceptibility evaluation. For ground collapse susceptibility, we maintained a bal-\nanced approach by using a 1:1 ratio of disaster to non-disaster points in the training set (with\ndisaster points marked as 1 and non-disaster as 0). Given the limited extent of collapse areas,\nwe obtained 300 collapse data points and chose 210 points each from collapse and non-collapse\ncategories for training. This strategy mitigates bias towards more frequently occurring non-\ncollapse conditions.\nThe trained models were then applied to predict the likelihood of ground collapse for each\npixel (with probabilities between 0–1) and to estimate the cumulative subsidence for each loca-\ntion. Post-simulation, model effectiveness was gauged using the Area Under the ROC Curve\n(AUC). The standalone Random Forest model achieved an AUC of 0.83 for ground collapse\nFig 5. Schematic diagram of the structure for the RF-BP neural network coupling model.\nhttps://do i.org/10.1371/j ournal.pone .0310724.g00 5\nPLOS ONE\nGround deformati on susceptibility in Hangz hou\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03107 24 December 12, 2024 9 / 19\nsusceptibility. However, the combined Random Forest and Back Propagation Neural Network\n(RF-BPNN) model enhanced the AUC to 0.89, reflecting a 7% accuracy improvement. For\ncumulative subsidence prediction, the RF-BPNN model exhibited high accuracy with AUC\nscores of 0.99 for low (less than 24mm), 0.99 for moderate (24mm-64mm), 0.97 for high\n(64mm-96mm), and 0.99 for very high (96mm-128mm) susceptibility levels.\nPost-prediction, the results of the RF-BPNN model were integrated into ArcGIS 10.8 to\ndelineate ground deformation disaster susceptibility zones. Fig 6B illustrates a comparison of\nthe actual ground deformation scenarios from 2018–2022, sourced from Zhejiang Geological\nSurvey shapefile data and analyzed using InSAR techniques, with susceptibility zones expertly\ndemarcated. Ground collapse probabilities were categorized into four levels: low (0–0.25),\nmedium (0.25–0.5), high (0.5–0.75), and very high (0.75–1) susceptibility. Table 2 details the\nzoning area percentages and disaster point distributions.\nFig 6.

The overlap\nbetween simulated and actual cumulative subsidence data was quantitatively impressive at\n90.31%, with specific overlap percentages listed in Table 3 for each category. These findings\nunderscore the robustness of the model in closely mirroring actual conditions in the study\narea, affirming its strong performance and reliability in disaster susceptibility assessments.\nAssessment based on ChatGPT4\nLarge language models (LLMs) are AI models crafted to comprehend and produce human lan-\nguage. Trained with extensive text data, they excel in various tasks such as text summarization,\ntranslation, sentiment analysis, among others. A distinctive feature of LLMs is their immense\nscale, encompassing billions of parameters to learn intricate language patterns. These models\nare generally based on deep learning architectures, such as transformers, facilitating impressive\nperformance in diverse NLP tasks. In this study, the LLM employed is ChatGPT-4, developed\nby OpenAI. ChatGPT-4, an advanced AI language model, is widely utilized across various\nindustries for its superior language comprehension and generation abilities, comprehensive\nknowledge base, creativity, programming support, and image processing capabilities. In this\nresearch, ChatGPT-4 was supplied with documents akin to those provided to human experts,\nincluding basic geological information of the study area, historical ground deformation inci-\ndents, their economic and human safety impacts, and prior susceptibility evaluation content.\nUtilizing ChatGPT-4’s data parsing capabilities, it performs fundamental analyses. Through-\nout this process, ChatGPT-4 employs logical reasoning to comprehend how various factors,\nincluding geological features and historical disasters, affect the weighting of ground collapse\nand subsidence, as well as the correlations and potential impacts among the data. Subse-\nquently, it leverages its extensive pre-trained knowledge base for data analysis. ChatGPT-4 can\nprovide insights by applying its understanding of analogous situations, particularly in inter-\npreting geological events and disaster impacts. Researchers can initiate interactive dialogues to\npose additional questions or request more in-depth analysis of specific data. This interactive\ncapability renders the analysis process more flexible and adaptable. Ultimately, ChatGPT-4\nrenders judgments and offers rational explanations. The fundamental logic of this process is\ndepicted in Fig 7.\nTable 2.

Additionally, human experts\nfully monitored the AI’s predictive process in this case, and the data analysis results underwent\nhuman review and analysis.\nIn this research, the interaction with ChatGPT-4 commenced with organizing and directly\nuploading the necessary textual materials from Hangzhou geological experts to ChatGPT-4. As\nthe research materials were exclusively in text format, ChatGPT- 4’s image reading compre-\nhension capabilities were not utilized in this process. Subsequently, ChatGPT-4 was requested\nto analyze the data as a geological expert and make judgments on the weights of ground col-\nlapse and subsidence, elucidating the basis for these judgments. Once ChatGPT-4 fully com-\nprehended the document materials’ logic and the researchers’ requests, it conducted the\nanalysis and provided weight judgments, as detailed in Fig 8.\nDiscussion\nIn the comprehensive assessment of ground deformation hazards, with a weighting of 0.4 for\nground subsidence and 0.6 for ground collapse, we categorized the risk zones as follows: low\nsusceptibility zone (0–0.25), moderate susceptibility zone (0.25–0.5), high susceptibility zone\nFig 7. The principle of judgmen t by large language models .\nhttps://do i.org/10.1371/j ournal.pone .0310724.g00 7\nPLOS ONE\nGround deformati on susceptibility in Hangz hou\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03107 24 December 12, 2024 12 / 19\n(0.5–0.75), and very high susceptibility zone (0.75–1). To create the comprehensive susceptibil-\nity assessment map, we utilized the raster calculator function in ArcGIS 10.8 software, result-\ning in the overlay of single-hazard susceptibility maps for ground collapse and ground\nsubsidence, as depicted in Fig 9. The proportions in this map are as follows: low susceptibility\nzone 23.71%, moderate susceptibility zone 42.61%, high susceptibility zone 27.16%, and very\nhigh susceptibility zone 6.52%.\nBased on the research area data, we have observed that the high and very high susceptibility\nzones in the evaluation results feature elevated bridges and are densely populated areas with\nsignificant human activity. Additionally, these areas exhibit a higher prevalence of high-rise\nbuildings, increased utilization of underground space, reduced thickness of surface fill, and a\ndense distribution of underground pipelines. In contrast, the moderate and low susceptibility\nzones in the evaluation results are situated in proximity to the Qiantang River, characterized\nby fewer buildings and pipelines, as well as relatively minor human activity alteration.\nHowever, due to the imbalance in the proportion of collapse disaster sites versus non-disas-\nter sites, the evaluation results of machine learning models tend to overly rely on the disaster\nFig 8. The process of judgment by large langua ge models in this study.\nhttps://do i.org/10.1371/j ournal.pone .0310724.g00 8\nPLOS ONE\nGround deformati on susceptibility in Hangz hou\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03107 24 December 12, 2024 13 / 19\nsites rather than the evaluation factors, even under the premise of a high AUC value. This\nhighlights a limitation in using machine learning models for susceptibility assessment in\nsmall-scale geological disasters. Therefore, to enhance application and research in this area, we\nwill increasingly integrate field investigations to achieve more accurate predictive outcomes.\nTo validate the accuracy of ChatGPT-4’s judgments, specifically its ability to match the cur-\nrent situation of the study area using provided disaster materials and questions, experts from\nthe Zhejiang Geological Survey were invited to employ the same materials and utilize the Ana-\nlytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). This process entails decomposing decision-making elements\ninto hierarchies, including objectives, criteria, and alternatives, followed by qualitative and\nquantitative analysis to determine the weights of ground deformation disasters in the study\narea.\nDuring the AHP judgment process, experts received the same materials as ChatGPT-4 to\nbase their judgments upon. The objective layer in the judgment process focused on the weight\nvalues of ground collapse and subsidence, while the criteria layer comprised ten indicators,\nincluding the impacts on the economy and human safety, relationship with geological condi-\ntions, current monitoring and management status, susceptibility assessment results, and causes\nand probabilities of occurrence. Of these, the first five indicators were weight determinants for\nground collapse, and the latter five pertained to ground subsidence. Finally, by summing the\nweights of the disaster indicators for ground collapse and subsidence, the overall weight of the\ndisaster was ascertained, leading to an aggregate judgment on the weights of ground deforma-\ntion disaster indicators. The specific AHP judgment table and disaster weight table are\ndepicted in Fig 10 and Table 4.\nAccording to the judgment results obtained by experts using the Analytic Hierarchy Pro-\ncess (AHP) based on the same data as ChatGPT-4, the weight ratio of ground collapse to\nground subsidence is 0.39:0.61. This is remarkably similar to ChatGPT-4’s judgment result of\nFig 9. Comprehens ive assessmen t of ground deformati on hazard suscept ibility in the study area.\nhttps://do i.org/10.1371/j ournal.pone .0310724.g00 9\nPLOS ONE\nGround deformati on susceptibility in Hangz hou\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.03107 24 December 12, 2024 14 / 19\n0.4:0.6. Additionally, upon comparing the judgment processes of ChatGPT-4 and experts, it\ncan be inferred that ChatGPT-4 possesses distinct advantages over expert manual judgment\nregarding judgment logic and reason explanation. However, despite the similarities in the con-\nsiderations of ChatGPT-4 and experts, there are still some immature aspects present in\nChatGPT-4’s performance. The specific comparison can be observed in Fig 11.\nConclusion\n1)This study explores regions characterized by filled and silty sand in Hangzhou, addressing\nthe gap in utilizing machine learning for the assessment of urban ground deformation suscep-\ntibility. Through correlation analysis, we identified nine key factors to construct a Python-\nbased RF-BP neural network ensemble model. This model effectively combines the robustness\nof random forests in handling multiple variables and detecting nonlinear patterns with the pre-\ncision of the BP neural network in improving predictions.\n2)Following the generation of ground collapse and subsidence susceptibility maps, we\nemployed the advanced Language Model LLM ChatGPT-4 to automate the disaster weighting\nTable 4.

Given area-specific disaster data,\nChatGPT-4 effectively assumed the role of a geologist and derived a weight ratio of 0.4:0.6 for\nground collapse versus subsidence. Expert validation through the Analytic Hierarchy Process\n(AHP) substantiated ChatGPT-4’s rationale, underscoring its effectiveness in geological\nanalysis.\n3)The study highlights the advantages of ChatGPT-4 in analysis, particularly its speed,\nobjectivity, and reliance on a database-driven approach. Nevertheless, we have identified cer-\ntain limitations, including restricted image recognition, insufficient explainability, and a lack\nof field-specific expertise. Despite extensive data input, certain aspects remain unattended to,\nindicating that the full analytical and decision-making potential of ChatGPT-4 warrants fur-\nther exploration. The ongoing development of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-\n4 presents an auspicious avenue for future geological research.\nIt should be noted that there are significant challenges in maturely applying large language\nmodels (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 to decision-making, particularly due to the \"black box\" nature\nof their credibility and decision outcomes. The rationale provided by ChatGPT-4 often\nremains obscured in a black box process. Therefore, when applying judgments based on lan-\nguage models to practical scenarios, it is crucial to ensure that the conclusions align with the\nactual geological conditions. Additionally, final judgments should ideally be validated by geo-\nlogical experts, positioning LLM support as an auxiliary tool rather than a replacement for\nhuman expertise. We also reiterate our call for more geologists to experiment with LLMs in\nreal case studies, to further explore the possibilities of this approach and aid its continuous\nimprovement.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: Bofan Yu.\nData curation: Huaixue Xing.\nFunding acquisition: Huaixue Xing, Weiya Ge.\nInvestigation: Bofan Yu, Liling Zhou.\nMethodology: Bofan Yu, Yun-an Li.\nProject administration: Huaixue Xing, Weiya Ge.\nSoftware: Bofan Yu, Jiaxing Yan.\nValidation: Jiaxing Yan, Yun-an Li.\nWriting – original draft: Bofan Yu.\nWriting – review & editing: Bofan Yu, Weiya Ge, Liling Zhou.\nReferences\n1.
