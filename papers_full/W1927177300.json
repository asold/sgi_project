    "abstract": "Objectives: The performance of parallel input and series output configured interleaved high gain DC converter using MPPT algorithm is analyzed. Methods: The output power of PV varies due to change in temperature and irradiation levels. This reduces the conversion efficiency. Hence, Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm is used to achieve maximum power from PV panel with suitable duty ratio and also improves efficiency. The simulations are carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK to validate the operation and effectiveness of the converter using MPPT algorithm. Results: The transformer-less two phase interleaved converter not only produces high output voltage but also reduces voltage stress of active switches. The simulation results for the converter using P&O algorithm is presented in this paper. The various parameters such as output current, output voltage and output power of the transformer-less two phase interleaved DC converter were compared with and without MPPT. Conclusion and Application: The converter with MPPT produces an output of 248.2 W which is 1.1 times that of converter without MPPT. Thus, the two phase’s interleaved DC converter with MPPT shows better performance and can be used for standalone applications.",
