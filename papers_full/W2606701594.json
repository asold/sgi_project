This has led to explicit progress in bulk reconstruction, particularly\nfor linearized perturbations of anti-de Sitter space [3{5]. There are also attempts to directly\nrepresent the areas of arbitrary surfaces in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in terms of\nnew information theoretic observables such as \\di\u000berential entropy\" [ 6{8]. All of these\ne\u000borts explicitly use the geometry and deformations of extremal surfaces of holographic\ngeometries.\nThis program is complicated (or enriched, as the reader prefers) by the existence\nof entanglement shadows: regions of the bulk spacetime which are not reached by any\nminimal or extremal surfaces used to compute entanglement between spatial regions of the\nboundary (see, e.g., [ 9, 10]). Holographic geometries with entanglement shadows require\nadditional quantities beyond spatial entanglement in the dual \feld theory for the purpose\nof bulk geometry reconstruction. 1 Consider, for example, the conical defect spacetimes\ndescribing excitations of AdS3. In this case, non-minimal extremal surfaces enter the\n1One might likewise wonder how an entanglement-based program would be extended to the BFSS\nmodel [11], which is a quantum-mechanical model with an 11d holographic dual [12, 13].\n{ 1 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nentanglement shadow region, and there is a candidate generalization of spatial entanglement\ncalled entwinement which yields quantities dual to the area of these surfaces [ 9, 14, 15].\nIn this work, we will argue that a simple but topologically non-trivial asymptotically\nAdS5 \u0002S5 geometry has an entanglement shadow. Our example is one of the \\LLM\ngeometries\" [16], which are holographically dual to 1/2-BPS excitations of N= 4 super-\nYang Mills theory. These geometries are smooth but topologically complex, and the map to\nthe dual \feld theory state is known precisely. From the perspective of reconstructing bulk\ngeometry from quantities in the dual \feld theory, one of the most interesting aspects of\nthe LLM geometries is that they are inherently 10-dimensional | there is no factorization\ninto an asymptotically AdS 5 part and a compact part. If there were such a factorization,\nwe could \\compactify\" the reconstruction problem to one of just recovering the geometry\nand \felds in the asymptotically AdS factor, but that is not possible here. In fact, it is\nknown that reconstructing the interior geometry and topology of LLM spacetimes from\nthe dual \feld theory using just local operator measurements would require access to trans-\nPlanckian physics [17, 18]. In particular, around con\fgurations with non-trivial topology\nthere is entanglement between the e\u000bective dynamical degrees of freedom and UV modes\nthat are beyond the Planck scale [ 19{21].\nWe will consider an LLM geometry which is approximately AdS 5 \u0002S5 in both the\nasymptotic region and a central region in the spacetime. In our geometry, the S3 radial\nsections of the asymptotic AdS 5 essentially exchange roles with an S3 factor inside the S5\nto form the central AdS 5 region. In this geometry, we study minimal surfaces anchored\nat the equator of the S3 on the spacetime boundary; these are expected to be the deepest\nminimal surface probes of the geometry, and compute the entanglement entropy of half\nthe \feld theory with the other half. Because of the exchange of the roles of the S3 factors\nwhich we described above, a surface that partitions the boundary of AdS in the asymptotic\nregion will partition the S5 in the central region. Making some systematic approximations,\nwe \fnd that in this central region, the minimal surface for a boundary condition which\ndivides the S5 penetrates into the bulk only for a proper radial distance of order one in the\ncentral AdS factor. At this distance, this surface closes o\u000b by reaching the pole on the S5.\nFrom the point of view of the full LLM geometry, this implies that essentially the whole\nof the central IR region is not accessed by boundary-anchored minimal surfaces. This is\nour shadow region. We then argue that there is an extremal non-minimal surface, also\nanchored at the equator of the spacetime boundary, which does enter the shadow region.\nThis is similar situation as for the conical defects in AdS 3 which have an entanglement\nshadow which is penetrated by non-minimal, but extremal, surfaces [ 9].\nUnlike in AdS3 [14, 15] we do not yet have a candidate information theoretic quantity\nsuch as entwinement that computes the area of a non-minimal extremal surface from the\nperspective of the dual \feld theory.\nThe idea in [ 14, 15] was that non-minimal extremal surfaces (\\long\" geodesics in that\ncase) were related to entanglement in a partition of degrees of freedom of the dual \feld\ntheory that was not spatially organized. It would be worth understanding whether there\nis such an interpretation for non-minimal extremal surfaces in the AdS 5 case also. In-\nteresting earlier holographic studies of Yang-Mills theory in the Coulomb branch [ 22{24]\n{ 2 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nhad proposed that a minimal surface which divides the S5 part of the boundary of an\nasymptotically AdS5 \u0002S5 spacetime can be identi\fed with the entanglement entropy as-\nsociated to a non-spatial division of the \feld theory degrees of freedom. In the context\nof our geometries, the surfaces described by [ 22{24] can be regarded as extremal surfaces\nin the central AdS 5 region, which can be extended into the asymptotic AdS 5 region to\ndescribe entanglement in a conventional spatial partition of the UV theory. Our analysis\nshows that the particular extremal surfaces studied in [ 22{24] are not, in fact, the minimal\nones that are asymptotic to the equator of the boundary S5. It would be very interesting\nto understand what information theoretic quantity is being computed by such extremal\nsurfaces, and also by the true minimal surfaces with these boundary conditions.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In section 2 , we brie\ry review the LLM geometries\n\frst constructed in [ 16], and introduce the examples we consider. In section 3 we consider\nextremal surfaces in the central region of our geometries, and explain the relation to the\nearlier work of [22{24]. In section 4, we argue that the boundary-anchored minimal surfaces\nin our spacetime close o\u000b on the central S5 without penetrating deep into the central\nregion. Hence these LLM geometries have entanglement shadows. In section 5 , we discuss\nthe extension to other LLM geometries and the interpretation of our results.\n2 LLM geometries\nThe 1/2 BPS solutions found by Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) [16] provide a rich class\nof asymptotically AdS5 \u0002S5 spacetimes where the geometry can be analyzed analytically,\nand for which precise \feld theory duals are known. We will focus on a simple example\nin this class, and \fnd the bulk extremal surface whose area computes the entanglement\nbetween halves of the spatial S3, across an equator, in the dual \feld theory.\nThe LLM geometries correspond to 1/2 BPS states in N= 4 SYM on S3 \u0002R, where\nthe energy of the state (\u0001) is equal to the charge ( J) under a U(1) subgroup of the SO(6)\nR-symmetry, \u0001 = J. The dual geometries should thus be asymptotically AdS 5 \u0002S5\nsolutions preserving half the supersymmetry, the SO(4) rotational symmetry on the spatial\nS3, an SO(4) subgroup of the R-symmetry, and a diagonal R group which combines time\ntranslation with the U(1) 2SO(6) to leave the state invariant. LLM found that these\nrestrictions \fx the form of the geometry up to a single function of three coordinates,\nz(y;x1;x2) [16]. The metric is\nds2 = \u0000h\u00002(dt+ Vidxi)2 + h2(dy2 + dx2\n1 + dx2\n2) + yeGd\n2\n3 + ye\u0000Gd~\n2\n3; (2.1)\ni= 1;2, where the functions h and G are related to z by\nh\u00002 = 2ycosh G; z = 1\n2 tanh G; (2.2)\nand Vi is determined by\ny@yVi = \u000fij@jz; y (@iVj \u0000@jVi) = \u000fij@yz: (2.3)\n{ 3 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\n(a) Disk.\n (b) Annulus.\nFigure 1. LLM con\fgurations in the ( x1;x2) plane. The con\fgurations describe boundary con-\nditions for the equations of motion on a two dimensional surface in the bulk spacetime, and also\ncorrespond to con\fgurations in a fermionic phase space that completely summarizes the boundary\n1=2 BPS state. The black disc boundary condition (a) leads to a pure AdS5 \u0002S5 geometry. We\nwill show that no entangling surface can probe deeply into the IR region of the geometry given by\nthe annulus boundary condition (b).\nThe geometry is supported by a self-dual \fve-form; the explicit form of the \feld strength is\nnot needed here. Note that in these coordinates the length element ds2 has units of length,\nas do y;x1;x2, while t is a dimensionless quantity.\nThe range of the coordinates is y 2(0;1), xi 2(\u00001;1), so this is an upper half\nspace.

The\ngeneral solution of ( 2.4) with such boundary conditions was given in [ 16]. Hence solutions\nare speci\fed by giving a colouring of the x1;x2 plane, specifying regions where z !1=2,\nwhich we will draw in white, and regions where z !\u00001=2, which we will draw in black.\nThe regions where z!\u00001=2 correspond to the \frst S3, with metric d\n2\n3, shrinking to zero\nas y!0, while z!1=2 corresponds to the second ~S3, with metric d~\n2\n3, shrinking to zero.\nNote that the solution is a ten-dimensional geometry, and except in special cases, it\nis not possible to straightforwardly perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction to obtain a \fve-\ndimensional description; we really need to think about these geometries using a ten-\ndimensional perspective.\n2.1 AdS5 \u0002 S5\nThe simplest example is the disc, where z= \u00001=2 for r<R , and z= 1=2 for r>R , where\nr2 = x2\n1 + x2\n2. The con\fguration is shown in \fgure 1a .

If we make the change of coordinates\ny= Rsinh ~\u001fsin ~\u0012; r = Rcosh ~\u001fcos ~\u0012; ~\u001e= \u001e\u0000t; (2.6)\nwhere \u001e is the angular coordinate in the x1;x2 plane, the metric becomes:\nds2 = R(\u0000cosh2 ~\u001fdt2 + d~\u001f2 + sinh2 ~\u001fd\n2\n3 + d~\u00122 + cos2 ~\u0012d~\u001e2 + sin2 ~\u0012d~\n2\n3): (2.7)\nThe \frst three terms describe the metric on AdS5 with AdS radius R; the last three terms\ndescribe the metric on S5 with constant radius R.\nIn these coordinates, for r < R, y = 0 corresponds to ~\u001f = 0, while for r > R, y = 0\ncorresponds to ~\u0012 = 0. Thus, the black disc r < Rcorresponds to the origin in the AdS\nfactor, with position on the disc mapping to position on the S5. The \fbration of ~S3 over\na hemisphere surrounding this disc is topologically an S5, homologous to the S5 factor in\nthe geometry (2.7).\nA partial visualization is shown in \fgure 2 .

We consider a set of D3-branes wrapping the ~S3 inside\nS5 at ~\u0012 = \u0019=2 where this ~S3 has maximal volume, with angular momentum along ~\u001e\ncorresponding to the R-charge. These D-branes dissolve into the backreacted geometry.\nNote that because of the angular momentum, the annulus geometry is stationary but not\nstatic.\n{ 5 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nFigure 2. A hemisphere over a black disc in the ( x1;x2) plane. An ~S3 \fbration over this surface\nis topologically an S5.\n2.3 Approximating the annulus geometry\nExtremal surfaces in the annulus geometry are in general complicated, and \fnding them\ninvolves solving a nonlinear PDE in two variables. To make the problem more tractable,\nwe will consider the case where \u000f \u001cR, so that the white hole in the center of \fgure 1b\nis small compared to the area of the outer disk. We will still consider the case that both\nradii are large compared to the string or Planck scales. The result is a separation of scales\nthat leads to a straightforward picture of the geometry.\nTo begin with, we can consider the coordinates at \\large\" radius, for which r2 + y2 \u001d\n\u000fR. In this case, the white disk in the center will appear small and we expect the geometry\nto be a small perturbation of an AdS5 \u0002S5 geometry with radius of curvature R. More\nprecisely, the last term in (2.10) can be approximated by a series expansion in \u000f2=(r2 +y2),\nwhich at leading order gives\nz\u00191\n2\nr2 + y2 \u0000R2\np\n(r2 + y2 + R2)2 \u00004r2R2 + \u000f2y2\n(r2 + y2)2 : (2.11)\nThe corresponding geometry is the AdS5 \u0002S5 metric (2.7) with a subleading correction\nwhich decays at large distances. We call this the \\UV AdS region\".\nOn the other hand, if we consider small distances r2 + y2 \u001c\u000fR, the geometry is well\napproximated by a black plane with a white disk in the center. Now the LLM geometries\nare symmetric under z = 1\n2 !\u0000 1\n2 while exchanging S3 and ~S3; thus, the region is well\napproximated by AdS5 \u0002S5 with radius of curvature \u000f, which we dub the \\IR AdS region\".\nMore precisely, the second term in ( 2.10) can be expanded in a series in 1 =R2, which gives\nz\u0019\u00001\n2\nr2 + y2 \u0000\u000f2\np\n(r2 + y2 + \u000f2)2 \u00004r2\u000f2 + y2\nR2 : (2.12)\nThe \fnal term in ( 2.12) gives a correction to IR AdS which decays in the interior, and\ngrows as we move to large distances. The fact that the sign of the leading term in z is\nreversed as compared to (2.11) means that ~S3 is now the sphere factor in the IR AdS space,\nwhile S3 is the sphere factor in the S5. If we further adopt the AdS coordinates\ny= \u000fsinh \u001fsin \u0002; r = \u000fcosh \u001fcos \u0002; ~\u001e= \u001e+ t; (2.13)\n{ 6 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nthe leading order metric is\nds2 = \u000f(\u0000cosh2 \u001fdt2 + d\u001f2 + sinh2 \u001fd~\n2\n3 + cos2 \u0002d~\u001e2 + d\u00022 + sin2 \u0002d\n2\n3) ; (2.14)\nmaking the approximate AdS5 \u0002S5 geometry explicit.\nThe IR AdS geometry can be thought of as the back-reacted description of the D3-\nbranes in the giant graviton picture mentioned in section 2.2 above. The D3-branes wrap\nthe ~S3, so this becomes the spatial directions in the AdS factor in this IR geometry.\nOne might hope that these two descriptions have an overlapping regime of validity,\nwhere \u000f2 \u001cr2 + y2 \u001cR2.

We therefore need to analyze the behavior in this\nregion independently. As an indication, consider the volume of the spheres S3; ~S3. The S3\nvolume is:\nyeG \u0019y2\nR\ns\n1 + \u000f2R2\n(y2 + r2)2 ; (2.16)\nand the ~S3 volume is\nye\u0000G \u0019R\n\u0012\n1 + \u000f2R2\n(y2 + r2)2\n\u0013\u00001=2\n: (2.17)\nTo arrive at these we solved foreG using (2.2) and the approximation (2.15) for z, throwing\nout terms that are higher order in \u000f=R. If y2 + r2 \u0018\u000fR, the terms inside the square roots\nin each equation are all of order O(1), and the square roots cannot be approximated as\nconstants. Thus, this region is not well covered by either the UV or the IR AdS approxi-\nmation.\nInstead, a natural coordinate system in this region is:\ny=\np\n\u000fRe\u0010 sin \u0002; r =\np\n\u000fRe\u0010 cos \u0002; (2.18)\nso that y2 + r2 \u0018\u000fR corresponds to \u0010 near zero. This is essentially a rescaled version of\nthe IR coordinates ( 2.13), with e\u001f =\nq\nR\n\u000fe\u0010. Then\nyeG \u0019\u000fe2\u0010 sin2 \u0002\np\n1 + e\u00004\u0010; (2.19)\nand the ~S3 volume is\nye\u0000G \u0019R\n\u0010\n1 + e\u00004\u0010\n\u0011\u00001=2\n: (2.20)\nThe function\nh\u00002 = yeG + ye\u0000G \u0019ye\u0000G = R\n\u0010\n1 + e\u00004\u0010\n\u0011\u00001=2\n: (2.21)\nUsing (2.15), we \fnd\nV\u001e = \u000f2r2\n(r2 + y2)2 (2.22)\n{ 7 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nwhich is order O\n\u0000\u000f\nR\n\u0001\n. If we further rescale t!p\u000f\nRt, then the gt\u001e terms are of order \u000fp\u000f\nR,\nand the term V2\n\u001ed\u001e2 is of order \u000f\u000f\nR; these can be neglected as the remaining terms are of\norder \u000f.\nThus, using dy2 + dr2 = \u000fRe2\u0010(d\u00102 + d\u00022), the metric is to order O(\u000f),\nds2 \u0019\u0000 \u000fp\n1 + e\u00004\u0010dt2\n+\u000f\np\n1 + e\u00004\u0010e2\u0010(d\u00102 + d\u00022 + cos2 \u0002d\u001e2 + sin2 \u0002d\n2\n3)\n+R(1 + e\u00004\u0010)\u00001=2d~\n2\n3: (2.23)\nThis metric is static and stationary up to corrections that are down by powers of p\u000f\nR. The\napproximations leading to this form of the metric hold if \u000f2 \u001cy2 +r2 \u001cR2, so that we can\nup to a point take \u0010 \u001c0. In this limit, we regain the large \u001f part of the IR metric ( 2.14)\nplus small corrections. Note the particular simpli\fcation in this intermediate region: the\ncoordinates of the IR S5 are multiplied by the same radial factor, so that the geometry\nstill has the SO(6) \u0002SO(4) symmetry of the IR region.\nThus, we havethree approximate descriptions: the IR AdS description, (2.14), valid for\nr2 +y2 \u001c\u000fR, the intermediate description (2.23), valid for \u000f2 \u001cr2 +y2 \u001cR2, and the UV\nAdS description ( 2.7), valid for r2 + y2 \u001d\u000fR. Between the UV and IR AdS descriptions\nthere is an exchange of spheres: the S3 in the asymptotic AdS factor exchanges roles in\nthe IR geometry with an S3 that is the S5 factor of the asymptotic geometry. We will use\nthese three overlapping descriptions to analyze the minimal surfaces.\n3 Extremal surfaces in emptyAdS5 \u0002 S5\nAs we have discussed, the annulus geometry for \u000f\u001cRinterpolates between two AdS5 \u0002S5\nregions, a \\UV\" region with radius of curvature R, and an \\IR\" region, with radius of\ncurvature \u000f. In this background, we are interested in \fnding extremal surfaces which are\nanchored at the equator of the UV boundary, bisecting the S3 of the asymptotically AdS\nfactor of the geometry. Because of the symmetry of the problem, and taking \u0012 to be polar\nangle on this S3 (\n3 in the metric (2.7)), there is an extremal surface at \fxed t= t0;\u0012 = \u0019\n2\nwhich extends from the UV region into the IR region. In the UV region this surface wraps\nthe S5 factor and bisects the S3 of the asymptotic AdS5. As we discussed above, in the IR\nregion, the S3 of the asymptotic AdS 5 exchanges roles with an S3 inside the S5. Thus, in\nthe IR region ( 2.14) a \fxed \u0012= \u0019\n2 surface wraps the ~S3 of the AdS factor, while bisecting\nthe S5 factor.\nAs we will show, this is not the actual minimal surface for the LLM geometry. To\nunderstand why, it will be helpful to \frst consider the co-dimension two spacelike minimal\nsurfaces of empty AdS 5 \u0002S5 with boundary conditions that either bisect the AdS 5 or the\nS5. Extremal surfaces bisecting the S5 of AdS5 \u0002S5 were previously studied in [ 22{24]\nthe authors of which were interested in studying non-spatially organized entanglement in\nthe Coulomb branch of gauge theories. We are interested in such surfaces because in our\nLLM setting the obvious candidate minimal surface bisects the S5 of the AdS5 \u0002S5 in the\ninterior of the geometry (the \\IR\"). We will show that surfaces that occupy a \fxed angular\n{ 8 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nposition on the S5 cannot in fact be a minimal surface; in fact, if we cut o\u000b the AdS5 factor\nby any amount, a minimal surface that partitions the S5 at the cuto\u000b slips o\u000b the sphere\nover radial distances of order the cuto\u000b. In our LLM case, this will imply that the minimal\nsurfaces of interest to us, which bisect the asymptotic AdS 5 boundary, will slip o\u000b the S5\nin the deep interior part of the geometry and thus terminate smoothly before penetrating\nthis region.\n3.1 Minimal surfaces bisecting AdS5\nIn pure AdS 5 \u0002S5 the minimal surface that bisects the boundary of the AdS 5 factor\npenetrates all the way to origin of the spacetime; hence there is no entanglement shadow.\nBecause the geometry is factorized we can see this from just the AdS 5 part of the full\ngeometry in ( 2.7). Let us choose coordinates for the S3 part of AdS 5 in (2.7) so that the\nmetric on this sphere is\nd\n2\n3 = d\u00122 + sin2 \u0012d\n2\n2 : (3.1)\nWe want to \fnd minimal spacelike co-dimension 2 surfaces in AdS5 which bound the region\n\u0012 \u0014\u00120 at the boundary (~\u001f !1 in (2.7)); following Ryu and Takayanagi such a surface\nshould compute the entanglement entropy of the region \u0012 \u0014\u00120 in the \feld theory dual\nto the space. We can take the minimal surface to lie t = 0, and specify it by a function\n\u0012(~\u001f) with the boundary condition \u0012 !\u00120 as ~\u001f !1. In the LLM coordinates (see the\ncoordinate transformation ( 2.6)), the minimal surface is thus speci\fed by \u0012(r;y) with the\nboundary condition \u0012 !\u00120 as r2 + y2 !1. Note that the function \u0012 is typically not\nde\fned for all r;y; the RT surface will end where \u0012= 0, that is where it reaches the north\npole on the S3. As we increase \u00120, the minimal surface will probe deeper and deeper into\nthe bulk, and the minimal surface for \u00120 = \u0019=2, where we keep half of the boundary, should\nbe simply \u0012= \u0019=2 everywhere, slicing the AdS factor in half.\nIt is obvious by symmetry that \u0012 = \u0019=2 is an extremal surface for the boundary\nconditions \u00120 = \u0019=2, but it is not immediately obvious in these coordinates that it has\nminimal area. This will be an important distinction later, so we note here that we can\nmake the minimality of the \u0012= \u0019=2 surface manifest via the coordinate transformation\nsinh \u001a= sinh ~\u001fcos \u0012; tanh \r = tanh ~\u001fsin \u0012: (3.2)\nIn these coordinates the AdS 5 part of the metric in ( 2.7) is\nds2 = \u0000cosh2 \u001acosh2 \rdt2 + d\u001a2 + cosh2 \u001a(d\r2 + sinh2 \rd\n2\n2): (3.3)\nThe extremal surface at t = 0 ;\u0012 = \u0019=2 becomes the hyperbolic disc at \u001a = 0 in these\ncoordinates. To see that this surface is in fact minimal we start at the boundary of this\ndisc (\r !1) and observe that if \u0012 were to change from \u0019=2 as \r decreases, the cosh 2 \u001a\nfactor (which is 1 when \u0012= \u0019=2) would increase, and with it the area of the surface.\nIn this AdS example, we can work with a \fve-dimensional description, but in general\nLLM geometries we need to work in a ten-dimensional geometry. The extension of the\nRyu-Takayanagi prescription to this ten-dimensional setting is to consider a codimension\ntwo spacelike surface in the full ten-dimensional geometry, the area of which is calculated\n{ 9 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nin units of the ten-dimensional Newton's constant [ 26] (see [ 27] for a fuller discussion).\nIn the present case, the minimal surface in the ten-dimensional description is simply the\neight dimensional surface at t = 0, \u0012 = \u0019=2, wrapping the S2 in the S3, the S5, and the\nextending along the radial ~\u001f direction in the AdS factor. In the LLM coordinates ( 2.1),\nthis surface wraps the equatorial S2 \u001aS3 and the entire ~S3; and it \flls the y;x1;x2 space.\n3.2 Extremal surfaces bisecting S5\nRef. [22] considered surfaces in AdS 5 \u0002S5 which slice the S5 in half, while wrapping the\nAdS5 factor. The authors proposed that such surfaces could be interpreted as geometrizing\nentanglement between di\u000berent CFT components on the S5, corresponding to some non-\nspatial decomposition of the CFT Hilbert space. This was further investigated in [ 23, 24],\nwhere it was proposed that it could correspond to decomposing the CFT Hilbert space in\nterms of R symmetry representations. The analysis in [ 22, 24] was mainly based on going\nonto the Coulomb branch of the CFT on R4, where one could de\fne a division of the CFT\nHilbert space at low energies into two factors associated with the unbroken gauge group at\nlow energies. But the relationship of entanglement between these factors and geometrical\nsurfaces in the bulk remains conjectural.\nOn the other hand, the extremal surfaces that appear in [ 22{24] are directly relevant\nto the holographic representation of spatial entanglement in the annular LLM geometry\nthat we are studying here. If we start in the UV region with a spatial decomposition of\nthe \feld theory along an equator \u00120 = \u0019=2, the symmetries of the theory including t!\u0000t\nimply that the surface t = constant, \u0012 = \u0019=2 is an extremal surface. In the IR region,\nthere is an e\u000bective description in terms of a new CFT dual to the IR AdS geometry. In\nthis IR geometry, as discussed above, the extension of a surface that is asymptotically at\n\u00120 = \u0019=2 bisects an equator on the S5. Thus, a surface that bisects the S5 of the IR AdS\nspace becomes related to a surface that bisects the AdS 5 of the UV region and hence to a\nspatial decomposition of the UV theory.\nThus, if we understand the details of how the IR CFT embeds in the UV CFT, we\nmight be able to interpret surfaces of the kind studied in [ 22, 24]. We will not pursue such\na CFT understanding here. Instead, we will show that in an AdS5 \u0002S5 geometry, the\nminimal \fxed-t codimension two surface which bisects the equator of S5 at the boundary\nof AdS5 does not extend into the interior of the AdS5 factor. Rather, for any radial cuto\u000b,\nthe surface extends inwards only by an amount of order that cuto\u000b.\nConsider AdS5 \u0002S5 spacetime with metric (2.14) (i.e. in the coordinates on AdS5 \u0002S5\nthat arise in the IR part of the annular LLM geometry). We can show that in these\ncoordinates \u0012= \u0019=2 corresponds to an equator on the S5, by introducing new coordinates\n(in analogy to the change to hyperbolic slicing in AdS in ( 3.2)). To this end, set\ncos \u00120= sin \u0002 cos\u0012; sin \u00120cos \f = cos \u0002; (3.4)\nso that the metric becomes\nds2 = \u000f(\u0000cosh2 \u001fdt2 +d\u001f2 +sinh2 \u001fd~\n2\n3 +d\u001202 +sin2 \u00120(d\f2 +cos2 \fd~\u001e2 +sin2 \fd\n2\n2)): (3.5)\n{ 10 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nThe surface at \u0012 = \u0019=2 is at \u00120= \u0019=2, and is nicely exhibited as an equatorial S4 in the\nS5 in these coordinates (i.e., the metric d\f2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 within the \fnal parenthesis in ( 3.5)).\nIn this geometry, this surface is not minimal. This is easily seen by considering a\nsurface where \u00120is some function of \u001f: the induced metric on the surface is\nds2 = \u000f((1 + (@\u001f\u00120)2)d\u001f2 + sinh2 \u001fd~\n2\n3 + sin2 \u00120(\u001f)d\n2\n4); (3.6)\nso the area functional is\nA= \u000f4VS4VS3\nZ\nd\u001fsinh3 \u001f\nq\n1 + (@\u001f\u00120)2 sin4 \u00120: (3.7)\nWe can choose a non-trivial function \u00120(\u001f) satisfying the boundary condition \u00120!\u0019=2 as\n\u001f!1 which will lower the area; we just need\np\n1 + (@\u001f\u00120)2 sin4 \u00120<1. For \u00120= \u0019=2 \u0000\u000b\nfor small \u000b, this is 1\n2 (@\u001f\u000b)2 \u00002\u000b2 <0. An example of a function of compact support which\nmakes \u0001A< 0 is \u000b= \u000b0(e\u0000\u001f+3 \u00001) for \u001f< 3, \u000b= 0 for \u001f> 3. Thus we know there are\nother surfaces with smaller area, before even constructing the minimal surface.\nTo \fnd the form of the true minimal surface, we turn to the Euler-Lagrange equation\nfor the action ( 3.7):\n@2\n\u001f\u00120\u0000(1 + (@\u001f\u00120)2)(\u00003 coth\u001f@\u001f\u00120+ 4 cot\u00120) = 0 ; (3.8)\nor in terms of \u001f(\u00120),\n@2\n\u00120 \u001f+ (1 + (@\u00120 \u001f)2)(\u00003 coth\u001f+ 4 cot\u00120@\u00120 \u001f) = 0 : (3.9)\nThere are two possibilities for a smooth surface; either the surface extends to \u001f= 0, with\nsome limiting value \u00120(0) = \u0012min, and @\u001f\u00120= 0, or it ends by pinching o\u000b at the north pole\n\u00120= 0 at some \u001f = \u001fmin, with @\u001f\u00120!1 at \u001fmin. It is convenient to analyse the second\npossibility in terms of \u001f(\u00120) rather than \u00120(\u001f), so that the smoothness condition becomes\n@0\n\u0012\u001f(0) = 0. Note that if @\u001f\u00120= 0, @2\n\u001f\u00120\u00150, so a smooth function satisfying this equation\ncan have a maximum but no minima. In particular, if \u00120 = 0 at some \u001fmin it must be\nmonotonic.\nWe expect the true minimal surface to pinch o\u000b by reaching\u00120= 0. The reason \u0012= \u0019=2\nwith bisects the S5 is not minimal in this geometry (unlike the surface which bisects the\nAdS5 factor) is that the size of the S3 \u001aS5 is independent of the radial \u001fdirection. Thus,\ninstead of extending down to the origin in the AdS factor, the surface can reduce its area\nby pinching o\u000b on the sphere. Since there is no scale to determine the value \u001fmin at which\nthe pinch-o\u000b occurs, it will be determined by the radius at which we cut o\u000b the AdS factor.\nThat is, we expect that over the range between a radial AdS cuto\u000b at some \u001f= \u001fmax and\n\u001f= \u001fmax \u0000\u0001\u001fthe minimal surface should move from \u0012\u0019\u0019=2 to end at \u0012= 0, where \u0001\u001f\nis independent of \u001fmax.\nSince \u001fis expected to remain large over the full range of\u00120, we can approximate (3.9) by\n@2\n\u00120 \u001f+ (1 + (@\u00120 \u001f)2)(\u00003 + 4 cot\u00120@\u00120 \u001f) = 0: (3.10)\nThis is independent of \u001f, which re\rects an invariance of the area functional ( 3.7) in\nthis approximation under \u001f!\u001f+ a. This is thus a \frst order equation for @\u00120 \u001f(\u00120), which\n{ 11 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nwe should solve with the boundary condition @\u00120 \u001f(0) = 0. We can make this equation look\nnicer by writing @\u00120 \u001f(\u00120) = tan \u000b(\u00120); then\n@\u00120 \u000b= 3 \u00004 tan \u000b\ntan \u00120: (3.11)\nAt \u00120\u0019\u0019=2, we can linearize around \u0019=2 to obtain\n\u00120= \u0019\n2 \u0000e\u00003\u001f=2\n \na1 cos\n p\n7\n2 \u001f\n!\n+ a2 sin\n p\n7\n2 \u001f\n!!\n; (3.12)\nso the solution approaches\u0019=2 exponentially; if we want\u00120= \u0019=2\u0000\u000eat the cuto\u000b \u001f= \u001fmax,\nit will extend to a range of order \u0001 \u001f\u0018\u00002\n3 ln \u000e.\nIn the limit \u001fmax !1 with \fxed \u000e, this surface has in\fnitely less area than the one\nat \u00120= \u0019=2.\n4 Shadow region in annulus LLM geometry\nWe can now address our main question. Consider the entanglement across the equator of\nthe S3 for super-Yang-Mills on S3 \u0002R, in the state dual to the annulus LLM geometry\nwith \u000f \u001cR where \u000f is much bigger than the Planck and string lengths. What is the\ncon\fguration of the extremal surface computing this entanglement, and how far into the\ninterior does the surface extend?\nSince this geometry is not static (though it is stationary), in principle we need to\nconsider extremal surfaces following the prescription [ 2]. However, in the UV and inter-\nmediate regimes, the metric is static up to corrections of multiplicative order\np\n\u000f=R. If\nwe approximate the metric as static, we will \fnd that the resulting minimal surface at\nt= 0, computed following [1], does not go beyond the intermediate regime into the interior\nregime. Thus we can self-consistently use the prescription in [ 1]. Note also that the surface\nat \fxed t also respects the t !\u0000t, \u001e !\u0000\u001e symmetry of the metric, so it is at least an\nextremal surface.\nWe thus consider a minimal surface dividing the S3 in (2.1) (which is the S3 of the\nasymptotic AdS5 factor), and wrapping the ~S3 (which is inside the asymptotic S5 factor),\nand \flling the y;x1;x2 space at \fxed t, possibly up to some terminal 2d hypersurface in\nthat space where the minimal surface closes o\u000b on the S3. The geometry preserves an\nextra U(1) symmetry, because we have not broken the rotational symmetry in the x1 \u0000x2\nplane. The minimal surface will then be speci\fed by some function \u0012(y;r) giving the polar\nangle of the surface on the S3 at each y and r, with the boundary conditions \u0012 !\u0019=2 as\ny2 + r2 !1, and possibly ending at some hypersurface where \u0012(y;r) = 0.\nBy symmetry, one extremal surface in this class will be \u0012= \u0019=2. But we do not expect\nthis to be the minimal surface. Recall that in the previous section we found that the\nminimal boundary-anchored surface in AdS5 \u0002S5 for a boundary condition which cuts the\nS5 in half is not the surface \u00120= \u0019=2 which cuts the S5 in half everywhere. We argued that\nit is instead a surface which pinches o\u000b to \u00120= 0 near the boundary of the AdS factor. Now\nrecall that in the interior of the LLM geometry the S3 of the asymptotic AdS 5 exchanges\n{ 12 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nroles with an ~S3 in the asymptotic S5. Since the surface \u0012= \u0019=2 bisects the S3 along the\nequator, in the IR AdS region it bisects the S5 factor. Given our reasoning about surfaces\nthat bisect the S5 in an AdS5 \u0002S5 geometry, we should expect that we can we can lower\nthe area in the annulus geometry by allowing our candidate minimal surface to slip o\u000b the\nS5 before it reaches the deep interior of the IR region.\nIn practice we need to be more careful; deforming the surface will increase the area\nin the UV region (which dominates in volume), so we must take care that this does not\noverwhelm the reduction from capping the surface o\u000b. To argue this we make use of the\nintermediate metric, which has a domain of validity partially overlapping the domains of\nvalidity of the UV AdS and IR metrics. We would expect the capping o\u000b to happen in\nthis \\neck\" region, where we cross over from the UV AdS where \u0012 = \u0019=2 is minimal,\nto the IR AdS where it is preferable to cap o\u000b. We will show that there are surfaces\nwhich cap o\u000b in the intermediate regime, for which the deviation from \u0012= \u0019=2 in the UV\nregion is su\u000eciently small that the contribution of the UV region to the change in area is\nparametrically smaller than the decrease in area coming from the intermediate regime.\nThe geometry in the intermediate regime preserves the same SO(6) \u0002SO(4) symmetry\nas in the IR regime. It is useful to make this symmetry manifest by making the coordinate\ntransformation (3.4), so that the metric becomes\nds2\nt=0 \u0019\u000f\np\n1 + e\u00004\u0010e2\u0010(d\u00102 + d\u0012\n02 + sin2 \u00120d\n2\n4) + R(1 + e\u00004\u0010)\u00001=2d~\n2\n3: (4.1)\nIn this coordinate transformation, \u0012 = \u0019=2 maps to \u00120= \u0019=2. (The coordinate \f in (3.4)\nbecomes part of the S4 metric d\n2\n4 in the above.) In the full LLM solution, we would expect\nthe minimal surface to involve a function of two variables, \u0012(r;y), which corresponds in\nthese coordinates to taking \u00120(\u0010;\f). However, the enhanced symmetry in the intermediate\nregime suggests that we can \fnd a minimal surface by taking \u00120= \u00120(\u0010), as in our previous\nanalysis of the IR regime. We will see below that the corrections from the UV regime for\nthe surfaces we consider are small, so this should be a good approximation to the actual\nminimal surface.\nFor a surface \u00120(\u0010), the area functional is\nA=\np\n\u000f5R3VS4VS3\nZ\nd\u0010e5\u0010\np\n1 + e\u00004\u0010\nq\n1 + (@\u0010\u00120)2 sin4 \u00120: (4.2)\nThe resulting equation for the surface is\n@2\n\u0010\u00120\u0000(1 + (@\u0010\u00120)2)\n\u0012\n\u00003 + 5e4\u0010\n1 + e4\u0010 @\u0010\u00120+ 4 cot\u00120\n\u0013\n= 0: (4.3)\n4.1 UV contributions\nWe expect the minimal surface to approach \u00120= \u0019=2 at large \u0010, where we patch on to the\nUV region. We therefore \frst consider a linearized analysis in this regime. The solution\nto the linearized version of ( 4.3) has the form \u00120\u0000\u0019=2 \u0018\u0000\u000e0e\u0000a\u0010, with a = 4 or a = 1.\nThese are fast and slow fall-o\u000b branches, analogous to the familiar normalizable and non-\nnormalizable branches for a mode in AdS. We can expand ( 4.2) to quadratic order in \u000e0 to\napproximate the gain or loss in area, and compare to the contribution in the UV region.\n{ 13 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nIf the surface approaches \u00120= \u0019=2 at large \u0010 with a non-zero coe\u000ecient for the a= 1\nsolution, the integral over \u0010 is dominated by large values of \u0010, and the change in area from\nthe \u00120= \u0019\n2 solution is of the order:\n\u0001Aa=1\nint \u0018\u0000\np\n\u000f5R3\u000e2\n0e3\u0010max: (4.4)\nWhile the solution appears to lower the area, we must also take the contribution from the\nUV region into account. If we takey;r \u0018\u000f\u000eR1\u0000\u000e with 0 <\u000e < 1\n2 , the dominant contribution\ncomes from a region in which the UV metric is a very good approximation. The angular\ndeviation in the matching region is \u000e0e\u0000\u0010max \u0018\u000e0\n\u0000\u000f\nR\n\u00011\n2 \u0000\u000e. The UV contribution will have\nthe form\n\u0001Auv \u0018cuvR4\u000e2\n0\n\u0010\u000f\nR\n\u00111\u00002\u000e\n: (4.5)\nHere cuv is a constant which will re\rect the fact that the matching region y;r \u0018\u000f\u000eR1\u0000\u000e\ncorresponds to the range ~\u0012\u0000\u0019\n2 \u0018\n\u0000\u000f\nR\n\u0001\u000e in the UV metric. This covers a volume fraction\nof the UV S5 of order\n\u0000\u000f\nR\n\u00012\u000e, from the restricted range of ~\u0012 and the smallness of the ~\u001e\ndirection. If cuv scales with this volume fraction, then\n\u0001Aa=1\nuv \u0018c0\u000fR3\u000e2\n0 \u001dj\u0001Aintj: (4.6)\nIf c0 is negative, then we arrive at a contradiction. We can simply cap the surface o\u000b at\n\u0010 \u00181, with a gain ( \u000f5R3)1=2 \u001c\u000fR3 in area, so that the area remains negative. If we then\ndeform the metric to the pure AdS solution, the contribution of this cap remains small, and\nwe have a surface in vacuum AdS with area less than the \u0012 = \u0019=2 surface, contradicting\nthe discussion in section 3.1 . Thus, if a solution exists with the a = 1 behavior in the\nintermediate regime, it is not a minimal surface.\nInstead, we will consider surfaces which approach \u00120= \u0019=2 at large \u0010 with the fast fall-\no\u000b, that is a= 4. In this case, \u00120= \u0019\n2 \u0000\u000e0e\u00004\u0010, and the contribution from large \u0010 in (4.2)\nis suppressed. At the matching point e\u0010max \u0018\nq\nR\n\u000f, \u0012\u0000\u0019=2 \u0018\u000e0 \u000f2\nR2 , and the contribution\nto the area from the UV region scales as\n\u0001Aa=4\nuv = duv\u000f4\u000e2\n0 (4.7)\nwhere duv is a positive constant of order 1. This is smaller than the contribution \u000e2\n0\np\n\u000f5R3\n\u0001e\u00003\u0010ir from the intermediate region, where \u0010ir is the scale where the linearized approxi-\nmation breaks down (we will \fnd this happens while the metric is still well approximated\nby (4.1)). Thus, for the a= 4 solutions, the contribution from the UV region is negligible,\nand we can consistently calculate the change in area in the intermediate region.\nOne additional caveat, mentioned above, is that we assumed more symmetry in the\nintermediate region than we expect the exact solution to have. This allowed us to write \u00120\nas a function of a single variable \u0010. In general, due to the boundary matching that we must\ndo at large \u0010, the solution will have the form \u00120(\u0010;\f) (where \f is a coordinate in the S4\nwith metric d\n2\n4 in (4.1)). However, we expect that this symmetry breaking will increase\nthe area in the intermediate regime. Thus, since the dominant change in area occurs in\nthe intermediate regime, and the deviation from \u0012\u0000\u0019=2 is small at the transition point\n{ 14 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\n-10 -5\nζ\nπ/2\nπ\nθ′\n\u0011 IR AdS UV AdS \u0010\nFigure 3. Intermediate regime numerical solutions with varying values of\u00120(\u0010max), taking \u0010max = 4.\nThe surfaces plotted are the part of the subset that approach the a = 4 linearised solution, such\nthat they are candidate minimal surfaces. The blue section of a curve shows where the surface\nmove inwards from \u0010max, the red section where it moves outward. Equivalent \ripped solutions\n\u00120 !\u0019\u0000\u00120 are not shown for clarity. Orange dashed lines are truncated series solutions of ( 4.3),\nshowing the discrete values of \u00120(\u0010max) for which the surface reaches \u00120 = 0. The thickest orange\nline hitting \u00120 = 0 at \u0010min = \u00001:37, through which one numerical solution passes, shows the true\nminimal surface which approaches \u00120 = \u0019=2 at large \u0010 in this LLM geometry.\nto the UV metric, the symmetry-breaking component of the true minimal surface will be\nsuppressed. In other words, if we choose the surface in the intermediate region to only\ndepend on \u0010 we get a smaller area, and thus although some \f dependence will be induced\nby the matching with the UV, it will be suppressed since it is advantageous for the minimal\nsurface to depend to be a function only, or mostly, of \u0010.\n4.2 Minimal surface\nWe can \fnd extremal surfaces by solving the equation (4.3) numerically, with the boundary\ncondition that we approach the linearized solution with a = 4 at large \u0010. We solve for\n\u000e(\u0010) = \u00120\u0000\u0019=2, taking the boundary condition (1 =\u000e)(d\u000e=d\u0010) = \u00004 at some large radius\n\u0010max, and shoot in. The solutions are shown in \fgure 3 .\nWe \fnd that the solutions have an interesting structure: the solution for generic values\nof \u000e(\u0010max) encounters a turning point where @\u0010\u00120 ! 1, and then an extremum where\n@\u0010\u00120= 0, and then returns to large \u0010 with \u00120!\u0019=2. These generic surfaces do not satisfy\nour boundary conditions, as they would intersect the boundary twice.\n{ 15 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nThose surfaces whose deviation from \u00120 = \u0019=2 at \u0010max is su\u000eciently small that they\nreach the IR region begin to oscillate around \u00120 = \u0019=2 as described by ( 3.12). The sur-\nface's deviation from \u0019=2 grows exponentially until the linearized solution is invalid. The\ncandidate minimal surfaces arise for discrete values of the initial conditions, where the \frst\nturning point lies at \u00120= 0 or \u00120= \u0019, and the surface smoothly caps o\u000b. If the solution hits\n\u00120= 0 at \u0010 = \u00100, smoothness requires that \u0010\u0000\u00100 \u0018(\u00120)2 +::: . Indeed, we can expand ( 4.3)\nabout \u00120 = 0;\u0010 = \u00100 to \fnd \u00120(\u0010 \u0000\u00100) \u0018(\u0010 \u0000\u00100)1=2. Of the solutions which cap o\u000b, the\nsolution with the lowest area caps o\u000b at the largest value of \u0010, \u0010 = \u00001:37.\nThe minimal surface has an area 1:43\np\n\u000f5R3 less than the \u0012= \u0019=2 surface. As expected\nfrom the general scaling argument, the reduction in area scales as\np\n\u000f5R3. Thus, from\nthe analysis in the intermediate regime, which is reliable for the surfaces which approach\n\u0012 = \u0019=2 in the UV on the fast fall-o\u000b a = 4 branch, we learn that there is a surface in\nthe LLM annulus geometry which bisects the S3 of the AdS5 factor at in\fnity at \u0012= \u0019=2\nwhich has smaller area than the surface that remains at \u0012= \u0019=2 throughout. The surface\ncaps o\u000b in the intermediate regime, at the edge of the region where the IR AdS metric\nbegins to be a good approximation. Thus, the minimal surface barely reaches the interior\nIR AdS regime.\n5 Discussion\nWe have found new examples of entanglement shadows in LLM geometries. We analysed\na speci\fc example where the geometry is simple enough that we could approximately\ndetermine the location of the minimal surface, but we expect this behavior to be more\ngeneral. The essential reason for the change in the minimal surface is that the S3 that our\nminimal surface divides goes from having a volume which decreases as we moved inwards\nthrough the UV region, to being essentially constant as we enter the IR region. When the\nvolume of the sphere is decreasing, the minimal area surface stretches across the ball, as in\n\rat space. But when the volume of the sphere becomes constant, the minimal surface wraps\naround the sphere at nearly constant radius, as on a cylinder. Thus we would expect that\nsuch shadows would be seen in any LLM geometry where the volume of the S3 becomes\napproximately constant in the interior. That is, for cases where there are one or more\nwhite regions inside a black region.\nOur story is not, however, completely generic. If we consider instead an LLM geometry\nwith two black discs, when the discs are well-separated we can treat the region near each\ndisc as an approximate copy of AdS 5 \u0002S5, and we would not expect there to be a shadow\nregion. There is also no reason to expect a shadow for small \ructuations in the shape of\nthe AdS black disc geometry.\nAs we vary \u00120, the location of the minimal surface jumps at \u00120 = \u0019=2 from passing\nabove the shadow region to passing below it. However, there is an extremal non-minimal\nsurface at \u0012 = \u0019=2 which passes through the shadow region. Each point in the shadow\nregion lies on such a surface for some choice of division of the boundary. Therefore it\nwould be very interesting if this non-minimal surface could be interpreted in terms of a\nCFT observable, similar to the entwinement of [9, 14]. One of the advantages of conducting\n{ 16 {\nJHEP11(2017)159\nthe analysis in the LLM context is that the dual CFT states are known precisely, so we\ncan explore the entanglement structure of these states and see if they lead to interesting\nobservables. The states correspond to Young tableaux, and it is intriguing to speculate that\nthe SN structure encoded in these tableaux could play a role here, as the SN symmetry of\nthe symmetric orbifold did in the entwinement story.\nAnother possibly related discussion is that in [24], which studies surfaces in a Coulomb\nbranch geometry in which SU(N) is broken to SU(m)\u0002SU(N\u0000m) where m;N are of similar\norder. They construct surfaces that bisect the S5 factor at large radius (scales above the\nsymmetry breaking scale) and pass between the two IR AdS factors; whether the minimal\nsurface in this class enters one region, the other, or neither, depends on where one places\nthe cuto\u000b. They conjecture that surfaces passing between the two factors measure the\nentanglement between the light \felds associated with each unbroken gauge factor.\nAs the cuto\u000b is removed, all of these surfaces bisect the S5 at the equator, as proven\nin [23]. However, following our discussion above, none of these are minimal for any cuto\u000b;\nthere are always arbitrarily small extremal surfaces which only extend inward for a small\ndistance away from the cuto\u000b surface. In \fgure 3 of [ 24], these would be surfaces that\npass r = 0 at larger values of y than are shown. Nonetheless, the surfaces studied in [ 24]\nare extremal, and as with the entwinement story there may be a plausible inerpretation in\nterms of entanglement explicitly involving the matrix degrees of freedom of the theory.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful for useful discussions with Aitor Lewkowycz, Onkar Parrikar and Charles\nRabideau.
