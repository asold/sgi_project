Introduction \nClinical trial is a planned experiment designed to assess the safety and efficacy of health \ninterventions (e.g., drug, diagnostics, devices  and therapy protocols) in man [1]. To obtain \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) approval on health intervention, entire clinical trial data \nshould be submit ted to FDA.  The size , quantity and complexity  of cli nical trial results , \nhowever, are enormous; it is a one of the ma jor obstacles in reviews of clinical trial result. \nThus, FDA has recommended utilizing Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium \n(CDISC) standard models as regulatory submission since 2004. Following these trends, major \nClinical Trial Management Systems (CTMSs) support the CDISC standards on clinical trial \ndata exporting and importing functions [2]. Most of these systems, however, are proprietary \nand there is no common rule for convert ing clinical trial data to CDISC standard -compliant \ndata. Without automation, they require labor intensive or time -consuming processes such as \nre-entering data and manually mapping the data to the standard models [3][4].   \nAccording to the purpose of how clinical trial data  is used , CDISC provides various \nstandard models. Among the CDISC standards models, the Study Data Tabulation Model \n(SDTM) is an integral component for submitting clinical trial data to FDA [5][6]; also used in \ndeveloping the Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) model that provides \na semantic foundation of clinical research [7]. The Clinical Data Acquisition Standards \nHarmonization (CDASH), a set of contents standard in clinical trial , is based on the SDTM \nmodel as well [8]. Thus , for the purpose of illustration , the present paper focus es on \nSDTM-related transformation applications.  \nCase Report Form (CRF) is the primary instrument for data collection in clinical trials [9]. \nCRF has a free document format, consisting of one or more sections, and each section consists \nof a group of questions that are logically related. Questions are the atomic elements of CRFs.  \nThe basic difficulty in transforming CRF observations to CDISC SDTM tables comes from \nthe different data structures. One has to first identify the correct domain for each question of a \nCRF before variable mapping and value transforming processes. SDTM ver. 1.2 has 32 \ndomains. The classification of questions into domains may be ambiguous and have to be \ndetermined by contextual information of each CRF. \nTo represent the semantics of CRF questions, we used the International Standard \nOrganization/International Electro -technical Commission ( ISO/IEC) 11179 Metadata \nRegistry (MDR) standard model for metadata description and registration [10]. The ISO/IEC \n11179 is a standard for representing metadata (semantic and syntactic) of data. National \nCancer Institute (NCI) cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) employ for representing \nCRF and conducting clinical research and trial [11]. It provides two types of standard model; \nobject model and basic attributes by its usage. The object model is  used commonly for \ndeveloping biomedical MDRs. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) , \nUnited States Health Informat ion Knowledgebase (USHIK) [12] and the NCI cancer Data \nStandards Registry and Repository (caDSR) [13] implement the object model as public MDR. \nThe other model, the basic attributes are used as descriptor s of variable s. The Tissue \nMicroarray (TMA) data exchange model, named TMA Data Exchange Specification (DES) is \none of the example s based on the basic attributes [14]. In the present study, we selected the \nISO/IEC 11179 basic attributes for describing metadata of questions in CRFs for clinical trials \nand research. \n1832                            Lee et al. : Brain Operated Korean Typewriter using the language prediction model  \nWe propose a novel method to convert clinical trial data to CDISC standard-compliant data \nsemi-automatically by using ISO/IEC 11179 metadata standard. To achieve this, we \ndeveloped SDTM mapping rules, which are consisted of SDTM attributes to ISO/IEC 11179 \nbasic attributes . We also developed CDISC transformer using SDTM mapping rules to \nconstruct CDISC standard-compliant data without labor-intensive works.  \n2. Method \nThe ISO/IEC 11179 basic attributes consist of 45 attributes for describing met adata. We \ncustomized the basic attributes  for the purpose of SDTM transformation. We eliminated \namong the 45 attributes non-essential variables such as optional and provenance-related ones \n(i.e., „origins‟, „ownership’, and „submitted organization ‟ of metadata)  and add ed two \nattributes to describe CRF structure (i.e., „CRF name‟ and „section name‟),  four attributes to \ndescribe concepts ( „Concept ID ‟, „Concept name‟ , „Concept category ‟ and „Concept \nsubcategory‟). Finally, we constructed 17 attribut es: 1) Question label, 2) CRF name , 3) \nSection name , 4) Question ID ,  5) Object,  6) Property, 7) Value domain type \n(Enumerated/Non-Enumerated), 8) Maximum length, 9) Minimum length, 10) Data type, 11) \nUnit of measure , 12) Permissible value , 13) Permissible value ID , 14) Concept ID, 15) \nConcept name, 16) Concept category, 17) Concept subcategory. Among the 17 attributes,  \nQuestion label, CRF name, and Section name  are trivial ones  that can easily be obtained \nwithout semantic or syntactic analysis, whereas the remaining 14 attributes cannot be. \nThe SDTM is built around the concept of observations collected from subjects who are \nparticipated in a clinical trial. Each observation can be described by a series of variables of the \ncorresponding domain table as a row filled with values. A domain is defined as a collection of \nobservation logically related with a common topic. In version 1.2, the SDTM consists of 32 \ndomains and related variables. According to this SDTM structure, CDISC Transformer has \ntwo sub-processes: domain finding and variable mapping.  \nEach domain in SDTM covers different context of clinical trial data. For appropriate \ndomain finding for a question, the correct semantics concepts of domains are required as well \nas question labels. We used the National Library of Medicine (NLM) MetaMap, which is a \nprogram to map biomedical text to the Unified Medical Langu age System (UMLS) \nMetathesaurus or, equivalently, to discover Metathesaurus concepts referred to in text [15].  \nCDISC Transformer ‟s domain finding process is as follows; f irst, we map the domain \nconcepts using MMTx (MetaMap Transfer) based on the domain na mes and their \naccompanying definitions defined by the SDTM specification. Then, five metadata attributes \n(i.e., Question label, CRF name, Section name, Object, and Property) capable of semantically \nrepresenting CRF questions are selected  among the 17 attributes. For each question, MMTx \nreturns concepts as outputs by means of using  the five metadata attributes as inputs. \nSubsumption test between question concept and domain concept determines candidate domain \nif a question concept has subsumption relationship with a specific domain concept. After the \nsubsumption test, we obtain the rank orders of the candidate domains for each question. The \npseudocode of the domain finding process is shown in Fig. 1. Each SDTM domain consists of \nspecific variables, which are categorized into five types; identifier, topic, timing, qualifier, and \nrule. Variables of identifier, timing and rule types can be obtained during the study and the \nvalue of them are not to be modified by a user, whereas variables of topic and qualifier types \nare to be described by a user. These two types of variables are subject to the mapping process. \nFor the  topic and qualifier variables, for each SDTM domain, we manually constructed \nmapping rule s between the previously selected 17 MDR metadata attributes and SDTM \nKSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS VOL. 5, NO. 10, October 2011                       1833 \nvariables as shown in Fig. 2. \n \n \nFig. 1. Pseudocode for finding SDTM domain \n \nSome variables that are in Trial Design Domains (i.e., Trial Arms; TA, Trial Elements; TE, \nTrial Visits; TV, and Trial Summary; TS) are to be defined by the research investigator in the \ntrial designing phase such that they do not appear in a CRF. CDISC Transformer disregards \nthese 41 variables are „about‟ CRFs because they are not available in CRFs. Finally, 307 \nSDTM variables are subject to CDISC Transformer mapping process. \n \n \nFig. 2. CDISC Transformer mapping rule creation process.

Rules are enhanced by additional rules for better matching.  \n3. Result \n3.1 SDTM mapping rule \nWe found that 211 (69%) among the 307 target variables perfectly matched with the 17 \nattributes selected from ISO/IEC 11179 MDR basic attributes. One or more SDTM variables \nare mapped to one of the 17 attributes, resulting 211 mapping rules. Top five domains showing \nbest mapping are Exposure; EX, Inclusion/Exclusion Criterion Not Met; IE, Substance Use; \nSU, Subject Characteristics; SC, and Concomitant Medications; CM. Among the 17 metadata \nattributes, Question label, Result record, and Unit of measure are the most frequently utilized \nones for the mapping. Among the 307 target variables, dependent (--REASND), indicator \n(--PRESP), descriptive and parametric variables are hard to map with 17 metadata attributes.  \nTable 1 shows a part of the mapping rule base for Inclusion/Exclusion Criterion Not Met \n(IE) and Laboratory Test Result (LB) domains of SDTM. Rows in Table 1 have four columns \nincluding source attributes, target domain and variable, and additional rule. „Source attributes‟ \ncolumn has 18 variables including the 17 metadata attributes (see method) and „Result Record‟ \nfrom the result file  from a clinical trial. Each row represent basic mapping rule with t he \noptional „Additional Rule‟, improving mapping accuracy. For instance, Question label for LB \ndomain is mapped both to LBTEST and LBLOINC. But the additional rule for LBLOINC \nrequires to apply the specified controlled vocabulary, Logical Observation Identifiers Names \nand Codes (LONIC) to map LBLOINC. The blank spaces in the first column of Table 1 means \nthat no attribute is available in source file to establ ish a mapping rule  for LABTOX and \nLABTOXGR.  \n \nTable 1.

CDISC Transformer‟s workflow diagram. \n \nCDISC Transformer consists of a set of processes including the domain finding process, CRF \nquestion to SDTM mapping rule, interactive user inquiry interface, and integrated algorithms \nfor the semi-automated creation of CDISC SDTM tables from user input CRFs accompanied \nby the observed results of a clinical trial and research . CDISC Transformer consists of input \nfile validator, metadata mapping, value mapping, and output file validator (Fig. 3). Input files \nto CDISC transformer are clinical trial result file and the metadata for the corresponding CRFs \n\n1836                            Lee et al. : Brain Operated Korean Typewriter using the language prediction model  \nand questions. These two input files have tabulation formats like SDTM. One row of a result \nfile consists of identifier variables (i.e., subject, site, etc.), timing variables (i.e., examine time, \nstarting time, etc.), question ID and result of specific question. Metadata file consist of \npreviously defined 17 metadata attributes.  \nInput file validator checks the attributes and values of input files , returning warnings i f a \nuser omit mandatory attributes . Metadata mapping consist s of domain finding and variable \nmapping process es. CDISC Transformer suggests a rank ordered candidate domains and \nvariables for each CRF question as shown in Fig. 4 demonstrating three components, Domain \n& Attribute Mapping, Target Domains, and Target Attributes. Then a user can manually select \nthe correct domain and/or variables.  \n \n \nFig. 4. Metadata mapping result and interface for approving or selecting the correct SDTM domains and \nvariables. N (Ⓝ: No Domain, filled with down diagonal), S (Ⓢ: Single Domain, rilled with up diagonal), \nand M (Ⓜ: Multiple Domains, filled with dots). \n \nThe first domain and attribute mapping part rates the mapping results by an automatic \nmapping algorithm into three categories, N (Ⓝ: No Domain), S (Ⓢ: Single Domain), and M \n(Ⓜ: Multiple Domains), representing no, single, and multiple domain mapping, respectively. \nWhen one approves or completes the selection process among the candidates, the row become \nC category (Ⓒ: Domain Mapping Complete). In the Multiple Domain category, the numbers \nin parentheses represent the number of mapped metadata concepts to the question in the \ncorresponding domain. By default, the domain with the highest number of mapped metadata \nconcepts is suggested as the best candidate. The second Target Domain part underlines the \nsuggested domains when a user selects a row in the first part. The third Target Attribute part \nlists the variables associated with the target domain selected by a user. Here  the underlined \nvariables represent „required‟ values and (T) represent topic and (Q) qualifier roles. Finally, \nCDISC Transformer generates output files compliant with SDTM formats by integrating \n\nKSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS VOL. 5, NO. 10, October 2011                       1837 \nselected domain and variables with clinical trial result file . Among the four SDTM variable \ntypes, values of the timing and identifier variables can trivially be mapped from directly the \nclinical trial result file to the output files and those of topic and qualifier variables are extracted \nby applying the appropriate mapping rule that determines the SDTM target domain and \nvariable (see Table 1) and the corresponding data from the MDR or clinical trial result file.  \nOutput file validator checks whether it follows SDTM struc ture, whether the variable value \nfollows SDTM terminology, and whether value follows value length, and whether the required \nfields each domain are filled up.  \n4. Evaluation \nWe applied CDISC blank CRF as a gold standard for an evaluation. T he Blank CRF is an \nexample document that includes which item on the CRF map to the corresponding domains \nand variables in the CDISC SDTM [16]. It consists of nine visits, 16 CRFs, and 125 questions. \nAll of  these questions are mapped to 13 domains and 304 redundant variables of SDTM \nmodel.  \nAs mentioned in method section, CDISC Transformer consists of two sub -processes: \ndomain finding and variable mapping. Domain finding is the core process of finding candidate \ndomain based on three structural (i.e., Question label, Section name, CRF name) and  two \nmetadata (Object, and Property ) attributes. Variable mapping process applying one of the \npredefined mapping rules starts after the target domain is determined. To test the effectiveness \nof metadata support, we evaluated the performance of domain finding processes with (i.e. with \nfive variables) and without (i.e. with three variables) the two metadata attributes. The three \nstructural attributes (Question label, Section name, and CRF name) can straightforwardly be \nobtained from the CRF itself and the two metadata attributes (Object and Property) can also be \neasily obtained from non-expert users. For a fair comparison, the following variable mapping \nprocess was equally applied to both comparison sets. \n \nTable 2. Evaluation of CDISC Transformer \n \nThree trivial attributes only Five metadata attributes \nDomain  Variable  Domain  Variable  \nCorrect 58 114 98 208 \nIncorrect  67 190 27 57 \nAccuracy 46.4% 37.5% 78.4% 68.4% \n \nTable 2 demonstrates the advantage of using metadata for better mapping. It seems that \nmetadata improved the mapping accuracies about twice. Domain mapping showed better \nresults than variable mapping probably because of the higher coverage of metadata for \ndomains and the more general concepts than variables. The accuracy can greatly be improved \nby the following user selections from the candidate lists. Table 2 shows results from a purely \nautomatic process without the user selection process. \nThirteen SDTM domains were mapped by the  evaluation study. Interestingly, most \nvariables in Findings General Observation class (Laboratory Test Results; LB, Vital Signs; VS, \nand Questionnaires; QS) were correctly mapped in metadata supported evaluation. On the \ncontrary, most variables in Special-Purpose domain s (Demographics; DM and Subject \nElements; SE) were incorrectly mapped. This result implies that similar structure s of the \n1838                            Lee et al. : Brain Operated Korean Typewriter using the language prediction model  \nFindings General Observation class (one question or test per row) and MDR (one data element \nper row) resulted high accuracy in contrast to the different structure of the Special -Purpose \ndomains (one question or test per column). \n5. Conclusion \nCDISC Standards are crucial to streamlining clinical research and trial process es, and to \nimproving data quality [17]. Many CTMSs have been used CDISC standards in clinical trial \ndata managing and submitting. This study tried to establish common transforming rules for \nCDISC standard compliant clinical trial data using ISO/IEC 11179 metadata description \nstandard. To the b est of our knowledge, none of the previous works has considered the \ncommon transforming rules in CDISC standard support. Based on the transforming rules, we \ndeveloped an algorithm, named CDISC Transformer, for transforming clinical trial data to \nCDISC standard compliant data. We also evaluated the performance of CDISC Transformer. \nMDR supported mapping process is demonstrated to be effective. \nCurrent version of CDISC Transformer applies very basic text mining techniques and tools \nincluding subsumption test and NLM MetaMap , leaving room for improving performance . \nThe other limitation of our research is that we focused only on CDISC SDTM model. Other \nCDISC standard models such as Operational Data Model (ODM), Analysis Data Model \n(ADaM), and Case Report Tabulat ion Data Definition Specification (CRT -DDS) will be \nincluded in the future study.  \nRecently, CDISC Standard model is not only used in submission of clinical trial data to \nFDA but also used in many biomedical research areas such as electronic data archiving during \nclinical trial [18] and designing element of clinical rese arch system [19]. Moreover, CDISC \nstandards are supporting not only the pharmaceutical industry but also other initiatives and \nservices in healthcare. Following these trends, CDISC Transformer and CDISC SDTM \ntransforming rule can be applied in applications for future research.  \nReferences \n[1] C.L.
