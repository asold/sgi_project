  "abstract": "The condition of the transformer can be accurately assessed based on dissolved gas online monitoring and analysis technology. With the widespread use of Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) technology, a large amount of dissolved gas time series data is obtained and forms DGA big data, which brings challenges to the data selection process of traditional condition assessment methods. Inaccurate results might be generated by selecting excessive or insufficient data from a long-span dissolved gas time series. The shorter dissolved gas time series fails to fully characterize the operation law of transformers, and the longer dissolved gas time series contains redundant information that results in inaccurate analysis models and excessive calculation consumption. This paper attempts to mine the optimal data selection rule of long-span dissolved gas time series for more accurate and efficient analysis. In this paper, C-C method was employed to calculate the phase space parameters of the time series. By analyzing the convergence of the correlation integral, the boundary conditions that maintain the time series phase space stability were revealed, and so was the relationship between the optimal length and the embedding dimension. The real cases show that the optimal data set provides the same accuracy and significantly improves the computation speed by 113.54 times. The optimal data selection rule eliminates redundant information in the long-span dissolved gas time series and retains the &#x201C;optimal data&#x201D;, which not only preserves the characteristics of the original data, but also improves the computation speed of transformer condition assessment.",
