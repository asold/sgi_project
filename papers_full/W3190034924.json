    "abstract": "Turn-to-turn faults between primary windings due to insulation degradation are a major cause of distribution transformer failure, and occur due to high levels of stress such as overloading and overheating. An additional consequence of these faults is an increased voltage on the transformer secondary due to effective change in turns ratio. This paper develops a novel method for early detection of insulation degradation and subsequent inter-turn winding failure by monitoring the transformer secondary voltage. The algorithm is based on a cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic and compares voltages on neighbouring transformers to flag degrading assets. Results obtained from simulation as well as experimental data show that smart meter measurements can be utilized to achieve very high detection accuracy while keeping costs low. Here, the paper also demonstrates the validity of the algorithm in the presence of measurement noise, residential solar power injection etc.",
