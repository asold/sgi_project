Gene sets\ncan be generated either entirely computationally or by a combi-\nnation of computational and manual annotation. While the\nformer is useful in generating preliminary gene sets, manual an-\nnotation is still necessary for ensuring accuracy and complete-\nness.\nRecent work in gene prediction has focused on generating\ncomplete gene sets directly from genomic sequence. Some ab\ninitio programs, such as Genscan (Burge and Karlin 1997) and\nFgenesh (Salamov and Solovyev 2000) are based on intrinsic\ncharacteristics of coding sequence (e.g., codon usage, consensus\nsplice sites, etc.) and require training on known genes from the\norganism. Others, like Twinscan (Korf et al. 2001) and SGP2\n(Parra et al. 2003), use sequences conserved between closely re-\nlated species. Although both of these approaches are becoming\nmore accurate and sensitive, they suffer from certain shortcom-\nings, particularly when dealing with vertebrate genes where ex-\nons are small and introns are large (Volfovsky et al. 2003). These\nprograms often overpredict exons and genes, fuse neighboring\ngenes, split genes, and miss exons or entire genes. Other features\npresent problematic challenges as well, in particular, overlapping\ngenes (Zhou and Blumberg 2003; Veeramachaneni et al. 2004),\nnested genes (Monani and Burghes 1996; Legare et al. 2000; Pont-\ning et al. 2001), tandemly duplicated genes (Ferrier and Minguil-\nlon 2003), noncanonical splice sites (Shaw et al. 2003; Tschan et\nal. 2003), pseudogenes (Torrents et al. 2003), and alternative\nsplicing (Zavolan et al. 2003). Some computational tools, like\nEnsembl (Birney et al. 2004), have incorporated experimental\ndata into their gene-finding strategy. Although the Ensembl\ngene-building system has been refined and improved over several\nyears, manual annotation has demonstrated that the accuracy\nand coverage of genes built by this system can be improved\nupon, especially with respect to alternative transcripts (Clamp et\nal. 2003).\nVertebrate genes are rather complex and experimental data\nappear to be the best source for their accurate identification. In\nresponse, the National Institutes of Health launched the Mam-\nmalian Gene Collection (MGC) Program in an effort to identify\nand sequence cDNA clones containing the complete coding\nsequence for each human and mouse gene (Strausberg et al.\n1999). Similar projects have been established internationally\n(Bannasch et al. 2004; Ota et al. 2004). Large-scale EST sequenc-\ning projects have also been undertaken with the goal of repre-\nsenting a substantial fraction of all genes as EST sequences. As\na result, a large number of transcribed sequences are publicly\navailable and can be used to confirm and correct predicted genes\nand to identify genes omitted by gene-prediction programs.\nWhile mRNA sequences have been used as markers on the chro-\nmosome to locate known genes, EST sequences are useful in de-\ntecting novel genes and alternatively spliced forms of known\ngenes.\nTo take advantage of the rapid growth of experimental data,\nwe developed a computer program called EAnnot to build gene\nmodels based on mRNA, EST, and protein alignments, to anno-\ntate the supporting evidence, to locate poly(A) addition sites and\nsignals, and to identify potential pseudogenes. EAnnot improves\nthe accuracy of gene predictions by evaluating splice sites, ad-\njusting gene models using protein evidence, making use of clone-\nlinked EST reads, and locating missing exons via local align-\nments. EAnnot can be used not only to support manual annota-\ntion, but also as a computational gene-prediction tool for\neukaryotic genomes.\n1Corresponding author.\nE-mail lding@watson.wustl.edu; fax (314) 286-1810.\nArticle and publication are at http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101 /\ngr.3152604.\nResource\n14:2503–2509 ©2004 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; ISSN 1088-9051/04; www.genome.org Genome Research 2503\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 5, 2025 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nResults\nTo evaluate the performance of EAnnot, we compared its pre-\ndicted gene set with the manually annotated gene set of human\nchromosome 6 (Mungall et al. 2003). The human chromosome 6\ngene set was chosen as a test case because it contains not only\nknown genes, but also novel genes, splice variants, and poly(A)\nsignals and sites. This enabled us to evaluate several aspects of\nEAnnot gene predictions. We also compared EAnnot predictions\nwith several well-known gene-prediction programs using manual\nannotation as the standard.\nEvaluation of EAnnot’s gene prediction\nWe compared the gene set from the manual annotation of hu-\nman chromosome 6 (build 31) (see Supplemental data) to EAn-\nnot’s gene set (see Supplemental data) and found a significant\nintersection of the two data sets from a comparison of gene\nboundaries (genomic coordinates of the ends of the genes) (Table\n1). Manually annotated and EAnnot predicted gene sets can be\nviewed at http://gmod.wustl.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/human_chr6.\nSpecifically, 87.6% of the manually annotated genes (not includ-\ning pseudogenes) overlap 80.3% of the EAnnot-predicted genes,\nwhile 92.7% of the manually annotated transcripts overlap\n91.9% of the EAnnot-predicted transcripts. Among the 193\nmanually annotated genes not predicted by EAnnot, 169 are\nnovel genes and 24 are known genes, including nine histone\ngenes. This is likely due to clustered repeats of histone genes. The\nmajority of genes not annotated by EAnnot (70.3%) are single or\ntwo-exon genes. Similarly, among the 339 EAnnot genes that do\nnot overlap any manually annotated genes (not including pseu-\ndogenes), 81.4% are single or two-exon genes. By examining the\noverlap between the EAnnot novel genes and the manually an-\nnotated pseudogenes, we found that 66 could be eliminated as\npotential pseudogenes. Although this indicates that the EAnnot\nnovel genes must be evaluated individually, our poly(A) data (see\nbelow) suggests that some of these genes are likely novel genes\nidentified only by EAnnot.\nTo determine the quality of the predicted genes, we com-\npared splice sites in EAnnot-predicted and manually annotated\ngenes. Predicted and manually annotated genes were considered\nidentical if they had the same splice site coordinates, while the\npredicted gene was considered longer if it included all splice sites\nof the manually annotated gene but had additional 5/H11032or 3/H11032splice\nsites. We found that 68.2% of the manually annotated multiple\nexon genes have at least one identical or longer EAnnot predic-\ntion. Among the 20,724 manually annotated splice sites, 17,874\n(86.2%) splice sites were present in the set of 20,901 splice sites\nfound by EAnnot (Table 2).\nTo further evaluate the performance of EAnnot, we com-\npared EAnnot predictions with Ensembl, Genscan, and Fgenesh\npredictions using manual annotation as a standard. While Gen-\nscan and Fgenesh are ab initio programs, Ensembl takes into\naccount experimental data, a feature shared with EAnnot. En-\nsembl predicted 1037 known genes with 1798 transcripts and\n1457 EST genes with 2308 transcripts for chromosome 6 (build\n31), while Fgenesh and Genscan predicted 6230 and 6225 genes,\nrespectively. We evaluated the performance of each program\nwith respect to splice sites, transcripts, and genes across all of\nchromosome 6.\nFirst, we examined how many splice sites were identical\namong each set of predictions and manual annotation. We took\nthe complete set of manually annotated splice sites and searched\nfor individual matches among the predicted gene sets (Table 2).\nEAnnot and Ensembl correctly predicted 86.2% and 84.4% of the\nsplice sites with a specificity of 85.5% and 82.3% respectively,\nwhile Fgenesh and Genscan had lower sensitivity and apprecia-\nbly lower specificity as compared with EAnnot and Ensembl\n(Table 2).\nIn order to evaluate predictions at the transcript level, we\ntook 3092 manually annotated spliced transcripts and searched\nfor identical or longer transcripts among the predicted gene sets.\nSince EAnnot uses clone-linking information (see Methods) to\nbuild gene models, some EAnnot models contain additional 5/H11032or\n3/H11032exons compared with manually annotated transcripts. These\nwill be counted as longer transcripts. EAnnot predicted 1524\n(49%) identical transcripts and 205 longer transcripts when com-\npared with manual annotation, while Ensembl (build 31) pre-\ndicted 817 (27%) identical transcripts and 488 longer transcripts\ncompared with manual annotation (Fig. 1). Among the 6230\ngenes predicted by Fgenesh, 72 have the identical splicing pat-\ntern as manually annotated transcripts and 197 are longer. Gen-\nscan predicted 47 identical transcripts and 185 identical, but\nlonger transcripts. When we allow transcripts with missing maxi-\nmum of four splice sites, EAnnot, Ensemble, Fgenesh, and Gen-\nscan predicted 85.8%, 85.5%, 54.1%, and 50.3% respectively\n(Fig. 1).\nTo evaluate the accuracy of predictions at the gene level, we\nexamined the number of manually annotated genes with at least\none identical transcript identified by each prediction program\n(see Supplemental Table 1). Of the 1411 multiple exon genes on\nchromosome 6, EAnnot identified at least one identical tran-\nscript for 64.7% of the genes, while Ensembl identified at least\none identical transcript for 48.1% of the genes. Fgenesh and Gen-\nscan identified at least one identical transcript for only 5.1% and\n3.8% of the genes, respectively. When we examined genes with\ntranscripts missing a maximum of four splice sites, EAnnot, En-\nsemble, Fgenesh, and Genscan predicted 82.1%, 78.6%, 55.6%,\nand 52.6% such genes, respectively.\nTable 1.

The average number of tran-\nscripts per gene on chromosome 6 predicted by EAnnot is 3.05\ncompared with 2.1 transcripts per gene in the manually anno-\ntated data set. EAnnot identified 20901 splice sites, only 177\nmore than identified by manual annotation, but produced al-\nmost one more splice form per gene on average. This appears to\nbe because most novel splice variants do not use new splice sites,\nbut instead use different combinations of splice sites (exons).\nSince EAnnot predicts, on average, one more splice form per\ngene compared with manual annotation, we manually evaluated\nthe quality of the splice variants in a subset of 15 genes and 101\ntranscripts from chromosome 6. Each of the randomly selected\ngenes included between four and 16 EAnnot-predicted tran-\nscripts (Table 3). Transcripts were classified as correct or incorrect\non the basis of the manual evaluation of the alternatively spliced\njunctions using the underlying evidence. EAnnot identified\n82.1% of the splice variants correctly. An additional 13.8% of the\ngene models were intron-retension variants, whose biological sig-\nnificance is questionable (Kan et al. 2002).\nAnalysis of EAnnot’s poly(A) prediction\nAnnotation of a poly(A) site defines the 3/H11032boundary of the gene.\nEAnnot uses ESTs and mRNAs with terminal poly(A) runs to lo-\ncate poly(A) sites and further maps them onto genomic sequence\nfor annotation purpose. EAnnot ’s poly(A) module identified\n2181 unique poly(A) sites and 2512 associated poly(A) signals as\ncompared with the 1303 poly(A) sites and 1211 poly(A) signals\nannotated manually on chromosome 6. The difference between\nthe number of EAnnot-predicted poly(A) sites and signals is due\nto more than one poly(A) signal being associated with some of\nthe poly(A) sites, while in the manual annotation, some of the\ngenes have poly(A) sites without annotation of the correspond-\ning poly(A) signals. Among the poly(A) sites identified by EAn-\nnot, 1704 (78.1%) map within 5 kb downstream from the 3/H11032end\nof 923 manually annotated genes. This result demonstrates that\npoly(A) signals and sites predicted by EAnnot are useful in an-\nchoring the majority of manually annotated genes. Of 477\npoly(A) sites not mapped to manually annotated genes, 160\nmapped within 5 kb of the 3/H11032end of EAnnot annotated genes. As\na result, 119 EAnnot genes that were not included in manual\nannotation or were longer at their 3/H11032end were supported with\none or more poly(A) sites. Among the 317 poly(A) sites not asso-\nciated with either EAnnot or manually annotated genes, 158\nwere associated with Fgenesh or Genscan genes (Fig. 2). This\nindicates that ab initio gene-prediction programs will continue to\nbe helpful in locating potential novel genes when expression\ndata are absent or rare. We found 69 poly(A) sites that are sup-\nported by multiple ESTs, but that are not associated with either\nmanually annotated genes or any of the gene-prediction pro-\ngrams used in this study. We speculate these may come from the\n3/H11032end of unidentified genes. This group of poly(A) signals and\nsites may serve as anchors for novel genes yet to be discovered.\nFigure 1.

The known genes, LAMA4, PTPRK, QKI,\nSH3BGRL2, and STX7, all have seven or more poly(A) signal and\nsite pairs. In many cases, different poly(A) pair sets are associated\nwith different alternatively spliced forms. Two splice variants of\nthe QKI gene having terminal exons about 6 kb apart clearly\nshow distinct poly(A) signals and sites. This suggests that differ-\nential addition of the poly(A) tail might affect mRNA splicing of\nthe QKI gene, leading to the creation of different splice forms of\nthe QKI gene.\nAnalysis of EAnnot gene model annotation\nThe coding sequence (CDS) was assigned to 3513 predicted chro-\nmosome 6 transcripts (66.7% of 5266 transcripts). Of these as-\nsignments, 1212 were based on protein alignment of underlying\ncDNA translation from the GenBank by EAnnot, while 2301 were\nbased on GeneMark calling the longest open reading frame (ORF)\nin EAnnot models and nonredundant protein database screen-\ning. EAnnot first annotates the coding sequence according to\npredictions using protein evidence. If there is a discrepancy be-\ntween an EAnnot gene model and the available protein evidence,\nEAnnot will adjust the gene model as suggested by the support-\ning protein evidence. If the difference cannot be resolved, EAn-\nnot reports the nature and the position of the difference. For 146\ngene models on chromosome 6, EAnnot reported differences be-\ntween the gene models and the protein evidence. This informa-\ntion is useful to annotators who might be able to resolve the\ndiscrepancy and is important for identifying potential EAnnot\nerrors, GenBank mRNA or EST sequence errors, and genomic se-\nquence errors.\nIn order to estimate how many of the CDS are called cor-\nrectly, we used BLASTP (W. Gish [1996–2004], http://blast.wustl.\nedu) to compare our results to the manually annotated chromo-\nsome 6 protein database and a nonredundant protein database\n(NR). For the 1212 proteins predicted by EAnnot based on pro-\ntein evidence, 725 (60%) have an identical match (100% identity\nand 100% coverage) to proteins from manually annotated genes,\nwhile 871 (72%) have partial matches (>98% identity and >50%\ncoverage). If the same data set is searched against NR, 914 (75%)\nproteins have identical matches, while 1115 (92%) have partial\nmatches. Some of the forms that didn’t have an identical or par-\ntial match against the manually annotated protein database are\nstill valid, as shown by a search\nagainst the NR database.\nEAnnot attaches the support-\ning evidence used to build the gene\nmodel. This includes EST, cDNA,\nand protein evidence. This allows\nusers to review the supporting evi-\ndence, make their own evaluation,\nand obtain additional information, for example, EST libraries and\ntissue sources. The number of ESTs and cDNAs supporting a gene\nmodel is also an indication of the expression level of individual\ntranscripts. On chromosome 6, 51.6% of gene models (in the\nEAnnot gene prediction dataset) are supported by multiple pieces\nof evidence. The fact that ∼48.4% of models are only supported\nby a single piece of evidence suggests that EAnnot is very sensi-\ntive in detecting rare transcripts. Beside attaching supporting evi-\ndence, EAnnot assigns predicted genes with a symbol and remark\nfrom LocusLink (Pruitt and Maglott 2001) if available. Both the\nsymbol and remark are assigned to all splice variants from the\nsame locus.\nFor chromosome 6, 101 models were extended based on EST\nclone-linking information (see Methods). There are several ben-\nefits to using clone-linking information. The strand assignment\nof some nonspliced EST reads can be determined based on the\nstrand assignment of the corresponding clone-linked spliced\nread. Sometimes an expanded gene boundary can be created us-\ning nonoverlapping reads based on their clone origins. When\nESTs from the same clone do overlap, a 5 /H11032or 3/H11032extended gene\nmodel can be created using the mapping of ESTs from the same\nclone.\nEAnnot also annotates both processed and unprocessed\npseudogenes. Three sets of pseudogenes were created by EAnnot\nusing distinct sets of parameters. EAnnot predicted 267 pseudo-\ngenes using parameters listed in Table 5. Among the 267 pseu-\ndogenes EAnnot identified, 197 of them have truncated coding\nsequence due to frameshifts or early termination codons. When\nwe lowered the mRNA identity threshold to 80% and allowed the\naccumulative gap to be 50 bp, EAnnot predicted 418 pseudo-\ngenes. Lowering the threshold even further, mRNA identity to\n75% and accumulative gap to 100 bp, EAnnot predicted 514\npseudogenes. This indicates that we could use our empirically\nestablished parameters (Table 5) to create an initial gene set and\na set of lowered thresholds to capture more pseudogenes.\nDiscussion\nHigh-quality annotation is essential in deciphering the growing\nnumber of sequenced genomes. Automated annotation greatly\nfacilitates the speed of annotation and reduces variability. There\nare various good gene-prediction programs currently in use.\nHowever, what is lacking is an annotation system with integrated\nfunctionality including predicting genes and splice variants, cap-\nturing partial genes, identifying poly(A) signals and sites, and\nannotating supporting evidence. To meet this need, we devel-\noped EAnnot. This system was originally designed for automat-\ning human genome annotation according to HAWK (http://\nwww.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/havana/hawk.shtml) standards. We\nhave since expanded its functionality to annotate other eukary-\notic genomes.\nTo efficiently and accurately identify genes using all avail-\nable experimental data, EAnnot program defines a gene bound-\nary based on the collective evidence of strand assignment, se-\nTable 4.

This feature is unique among existing gene\nprediction and annotation programs and provides the founda-\ntion for improved accuracy of gene boundary prediction. Follow-\ning gene boundary determination, EAnnot clusters sequences\nwithin the defined gene boundary to identify different splicing\nevents. The clustering combines all mRNAs and ESTs in one pro-\ncess to accurately predict the number of unique variants per\ngene. Manual inspections suggest that EAnnot’s alternative splice\nform prediction is sensitive and accurate (Table 3).\nTo provide further biological information, EAnnot assigns\nsupporting evidence in the form of proteins, mRNAs, and ESTs.\nThis feature enables independent evaluation and analysis. In ad-\ndition, it allows straightforward tracking of EST tissue origin via\ntheir GenBank entries. This feature should benefit researchers\ninterested in tissue distribution, developmental expression pro-\nfiles, and the pathological changes in the expression of a gene\nand its splice forms.\nAnother unique aspect of EAnnot is its use of spliced and\nnonspliced ESTs and mRNAs with poly(A) tails to identify poly(A)\nsites and search for corresponding signals in genomic sequence.\nThis not only locates the 3/H11032end of the gene, but also tags poten-\ntial novel genes supported solely by poly(A) sequences identified\nby EAnnot. The discovery of a substantial number of genes with\nmultiple poly(A) signals and sites sets the stage for future studies\non the regulation of RNA poly(A) adenylation.\nUsing manual annotation as the standard, we have demon-\nstrated that EAnnot predicts gene models with high confidence\nand accuracy compared with several existing gene-prediction\nprograms. In addition, EAnnot is able to discover splice variants\nof genes, which ab initio gene-prediction programs cannot. Even\nthough both the Ensembl system and EAnnot use experimental\nevidence to build gene models, EAnnot considers all mRNAs and\nESTs as a whole in building a common set of gene models, while\nEnsembl separates mRNA and EST data to build separate sets of\nmodels. Consequently, EAnnot is able to build nonredundant\ngene models, predict splice variants for each gene, and predict\nthe total number of genes in a given genome. Conversely, some\nEnsembl transcripts and EST transcripts are redundant. Further-\nmore, EAnnot is able to make more complete models using the\ncombination of underlying mRNA and EST evidence. Beside us-\ning mRNA and EST evidence, EAnnot also uses available protein\nevidence to fine-tune gene models and improve accuracy.\nEAnnot is designed to be versatile. By adjusting the param-\neters, we have been successfully using EAnnot to annotate other\nvertebrate and invertebrate genomes. For genomes with mini-\nmum experimental data, we rely extensively on the use of cross-\nspecies alignments with adjusted thresholds. In addition, we set\nan option of incorporating protein evidence into EAnnot ’s gene\nboundary determination and transcript clustering processes,\nwhich further improves the accuracy of gene boundaries and\ngene models for certain genomes. Due to the abundance of ver-\ntebrate mRNA data, we intentionally omitted protein evidence in\ndetermining gene boundaries and clustering transcripts for the\nhuman annotation effort. However, we did use protein evidence\nto capture single exon repeat gene families, such as the histone\nfamily. To annotate genomes with rare splice variants, we re-\ncently implemented evidence merging in order to build the most\nrepresentative and complete model for each gene. In this process,\nthe predominant splice pattern among evidence at any given\nsplice site within a gene boundary is selected to construct the\nmerged gene model. These adjustments broaden EAnnot’s appli-\ncability to virtually any sequenced genome, vertebrate, and in-\nvertebrate, with or without abundant experimental evidence.\nWe have demonstrated the effectiveness and the advantages\nof the EAnnot system in the annotation of the human genome.\nEAnnot will continue to be used in this capacity, but its use will\nalso be expanded for annotating other organisms. We envision\nthat by implementing an ab initio gene-prediction algorithm\ninto EAnnot, we will be able to extend partial, evidence-based\ngenes into full-length genes and uncover novel genes not re-\nvealed by existing evidence.\nMethods\nData used by EAnnot\nThe genomic sequence can be clone, contig, or chromosome\nbased. EAnnot can assemble the sequence and alignments from\nclones into contigs or chromosomes using an AGP file, facilitat-\ning the annotation of genes spanning more than one clone. Gene\nprediction and annotation are performed at the contig or chro-\nmosome level and can be transformed to clone-based coordinates\nto facilitate viewing. The primary EAnnot input is mRNA, EST,\nand protein alignments to genomic sequence, in the ACEDB\n“ace” database format, generated by BLASTN, BLASTX (Altschul\net al. 1997) (W. Gish [1996– 2004], http://blast.wustl.edu),\nest2genome (Mott 1997), or other alignment tools.\nEAnnot uses clone-linked EST read information (EST reads\nfrom the same clone) to help establish gene boundaries (see be-\nlow). ESTs were downloaded from NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/\ngenbank), and a clone-linking table was generated for multiple\nreads in which the organism of origin and clone IDs were iden-\ntical. All reads from clones with more than five clone-linked\nreads were disregarded. Also, clone IDs containing less than three\ncharacters or only numbers were not considered valid IDs and\nwere not used to link reads. These conservative criteria were used\nto avoid false linking. The clone-linking table generated from\ndata downloaded from NCBI on July 7, 2003 contained\n3,615,915 ESTs from 1,770,607 clones or ∼21% of the ESTs in\ndbEST.\nEAnnot uses information from LocusLink to assign gene\nsymbols and to help identify pseudogenes. Gene symbols, de-\nscriptions, and chromosomal locations are extracted from the\nLocusLink LL_tmpl file (ftp://ftp/ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/\nLocusLink/) into the locuslink.sel table used by EAnnot.\nAlignments\nEAnnot begins by examining the quality of all alignments and\ndecides which will be used, modified, or disregarded based on a\nset of adjustable, empirically established parameters, that is, per-\ncent identity, continuity, and local repetitiveness (Table 5). Per-\ncent identity is the percent of bases or amino acids in the mRNA,\nEST, or protein alignment that identically match the genomic\nsequence, or its translation. Continuity refers to the percentage\nof total bases or amino acids included in the alignments. Local\nrepetitiveness refers to whether any part of the mRNA, EST, or\nprotein aligns to more than one location in the contig or chro-\nmosome. EAnnot attempts to correct gaps in alignments by do-\ning local BLASTN searches and looking for nearby splice sites\nusing SplicePredictor (Usuka et al. 2000), evaluating intron size,\nand determining whether there are other alignments in the area.\nRepetitive alignments are evaluated based on percent identity,\nsequence order and orientation, and the use of consensus splice\nsites. While evaluating each alignment, EAnnot also assigns each\nEST and mRNA alignment to the appropriate strand based on\nEAnnot: Evidence-based genome annotation tool\nGenome Research 2507\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 5, 2025 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nread orientation and splice-site sequences. Every splice site is ex-\namined to see whether the best consensus splice site resides on\nthe plus or minus strand. If a strand assignment cannot be made,\nEAnnot will omit those ESTs and mRNAs from further analysis.\nNonspliced ESTs without a strand assignment are not used for\ngene prediction, but are used for the identification of poly(A)\nsignals and sites (see below).\nGene boundaries\nAfter evaluating and modifying alignments, EAnnot sets the\nboundaries it will use to predict genes and alternatively spliced\nforms. Gene boundaries are set at the ends of alignments and\nextended using overlapping alignments on the same strand.\nBoundaries are also extended with nonoverlapping, but clone-\nlinked reads in the clone-linking table described above.\nClusters and gene models\nWithin each gene boundary, EAnnot clusters mRNAs to create\nunique transcripts, each representing an alternatively spliced\nform. It only uses spliced mRNAs (those that span an intron),\nunless more than one GenBank entry indicates no splicing. It\ncompares each spliced EST mapped within the gene boundary\nwith each mRNA cluster, and either clusters the EST with an\nmRNA cluster or creates novel EST clusters. If no mRNA align-\nments map within a gene boundary, then ESTs are clustered.\nNonredundant mRNA clusters and novel EST clusters are then\nused to generate gene models by merging all of the members of\na cluster into the longest form. EAnnot only creates gene models\nbased on EST and mRNA sequences from each cluster. It does not\nattempt to merge clusters within the same gene boundary to\navoid building chimeric transcripts for vertebrate genomes. Each\nmRNA and EST in a cluster is attached to the resulting gene\nmodel as supporting evidence (see below).\nEAnnot makes three types of gene models; transcripts with a\nCDS, transcripts in which a CDS could not be determined, and\npseudogenes. Each gene can have one or more gene models. Each\ngene model is translated and aligned with the protein corre-\nsponding to the mRNA in the cluster that defined the gene model\nusing FASTX (Pearson et al. 1997). The alignment is used to de-\ntermine the initiator methionine and stop codon. Any mis-\nmatches, frame shifts, deletions, or insertions are identified. Mis-\nmatches are allowed due to polymorphisms and differences be-\ntween species. Frame shifts, deletions, and insertions are further\nanalyzed. EAnnot will adjust the gene model if a nearby consen-\nsus splice can be found that removes the frame shift, deletion, or\ninsertion. All other gene models within the gene boundary will\nbe adjusted to use this consensus splice site. GeneMark (Lukashin\nand Borodovsky 1998) is used to find ORFs for gene models with-\nout CDS assignments. Only ORFs >100 nucleotides and having\nthe best hit with the P value <1e-15 against nonredundant pro-\ntein database (NR) are kept. Genes are annotated as pseudogenes\nif the chromosomal location is incorrect (obtained from\nLocusLink). The information regarding frame shifts and incom-\nplete coding sequence is attached to pseudogenes.\nTo predict additional single exon genes that could have\nbeen missed during the clustering process, EAnnot re-examines\nall protein alignments outside of the identified gene boundaries\nand makes additional single exon gene models accordingly.\nAnnotation\nEAnnot uses information generated during the prediction pro-\ncess, as well as information from LocusLink and GenBank entries\nto annotate genes. All of the mRNAs and ESTs used in clustering\nare attached as supporting evidence. Proteins are attached if their\ncorresponding mRNAs are used as supporting evidence. Each full-\nlength mRNA can only be attached to one gene model. Partial\nmRNAs and ESTs are attached as supporting evidence to all gene\nmodels with a splicing pattern that matches the gene model.\nLocus information (locus name and description) from LocusLink\nis also added. If one gene model within a gene boundary is as-\nsigned locus information, then all the gene models within that\nsame boundary will adopt the same symbol and description. In-\nformation about poly(A) sites and signals is also annotated (see\nbelow).\nPoly(A) sites and signals\nEAnnot has a native module for identifying poly(A) signals and\nsites. All ESTs and mRNAs (spliced and nonspliced) are examined\nfor runs of As at the 3 /H11032end of the sequence, or runs of Ts at the\n5/H11032end of the sequence in case of reverse reads. The presence of at\nleast eight As or Ts among the last or first 10 bases of the se-\nquence is required before further analysis is initiated. EAnnot\nrequires at least five As or Ts at either end of the sequence not\nmapped to genomic sequence. Once poly(A) site is determined,\npoly(A) signals (AATAAA or ATTAAA) will be searched within 50\nbp upstream from the poly(A) adenylation site (Beaudoing et al.\n2000). If the poly(A) signal is found, the poly(A) sites and signals\nwill be assigned in pairs.\nComparison with human chromosome 6 manual annotation\nTo eliminate potential discrepancies due to differences in the\nunderlying data (mRNA, EST, and protein libraries) and differ-\nences in alignments, EAnnot predictions were based on the same\nalignments used by the Sanger Institute when doing manual an-\nnotation of human chromosome 6 (Mungall et al. 2003). The\nalignments were accessed from a local ACEDB database (Walsh et\nal. 1998). The manually annotated gene models from chromo-\nsome 6 were obtained from the Sanger Institute in the ACEDB\n“ace” file format, and were converted from clonal to chromo-\nsomal coordinates based on human build 31 AGP file (Supple-\nmental data). We divided chromosome 6 sequence into 20 su-\npercontigs according to the same AGP file. The average size of the\nsupercontig was 11,435,641 bp. The largest supercontig was\n19,934,087 bp.\nSoftware and Ensembl data\nGenscan and Fgenesh (v.2.0) were installed locally. Ensembl\ngenes and transcripts and Ensembl EST genes and transcripts\n(build 31) were downloaded from http://atlas.cnio.es/.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Michael Wendl for his helpful discussions and com-\nments on this work.
