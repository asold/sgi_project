Such waves may continue to occur and many lives can be saved through early\npreparedness. COVID-19 is reported to have claimed 5.45 million lives as of 10 January 2022\n(WHO Coronavirus 2021(COVID-19) Dashboard). A large number of these deaths are attributed to\nunexpected surges in infections caused by new strains with higher pathogenicity such as the Delta\nvariant of SARS-CoV-2, prompting international health organizations such as the CDC and WHO to\ndeclare these as variants of concern (CDC, 2022). The most recent surge of Omicron across the globe\nwith its potential for escaping immunity has seriously undermined the efﬁcacy of global vaccination\nprograms. Most studies around the globe have focussed on forecasting case time series using\ntraditionally reported administrative data. Standard epidemiological approaches such as\ncompartmental and agent-based modeling have been used extensively for forecasting COVID-19\ncaseloads (Arora et al., 2020). Additionally, numerous studies have used time series analysis, social\nmedia mining and multimodal approaches have been utilized for case predictions (Kapoor et al.,\nEdited by:\nTao Huang,\nShanghai Institute of Nutrition and\nHealth (CAS), China\nReviewed by:\nXuming Zhou,\nInstitute of Zoology (CAS), China\nKishu Ranjan,\nYale University, United States\nFei Wang,\nInstitute of Computing Technology\n(CAS), China\n*Correspondence:\nRintu Kutum\nrintuk@iiitd.ac.in\nTavpritesh Sethi\ntavpriteshsethi@iiitd.ac.in\n†These authors have contributed\nequally to this work and shareﬁrst\nauthorship\n‡These authors have contributed\nequally to this work and share last\nauthorship\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nComputational Genomics,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Genetics\nReceived: 19 January 2022\nAccepted: 14 March 2022\nPublished: 08 April 2022\nCitation:\nNagpal S, Pal R, Ashima, Tyagi A,\nTripathi S, Nagori A, Ahmad S,\nMishra HP, Malhotra R, Kutum R and\nSethi T (2022) Genomic Surveillance of\nCOVID-19 Variants With Language\nModels and Machine Learning.\nFront.

Earlier,\ninitiatives such asNextstrain (Hadﬁeld et al., 2018) have focused\non providing high-quality tracking information for the strains\nand lineages as these emerge without forecasting or predictions.\nHence early prediction of caseloads and emerging variants\nthrough genomic signals remains an open challenge for\nCOVID-19.\nUnsupervised embeddings have been shown to capture highly\nnonlinear and contextual relationships (Mikolov et al., 2013).\nBiological sequences contain a plethora of information that can\nbe exploited for genomic surveillance. However, there is a paucity\nof studies that explore the use of unsupervised embeddings for\nmachine learning based prediction of surges in infections. In\nthese models, codons (tri-nucleotides, 3-mers) translations\nrepresent a natural basis for word representations and have\nbeen utilized in the past for learning embedding models for\nmodelling various outcomes such as mutation susceptibility\nand gene sequence correlations ( Yilmaz, 2020)( Wu et al.,\n2021). Recently, Hie et al. used machine learning along with\nword embedding techniques to model the semantics and\ngrammar of amino acids corresponding to antigenic change to\npredict the mutations which might lead to viral escape (Hie et al.,\n2021). Similarly, Maher et al. predicted emerging mutations of\nSARS-CoV-2 variants and evaluated biological and neural\nnetwork based predictors of emerging mutations (Maher et al.,\n2021). Here, we proposeStrainﬂow (Figure 1), a prospectively\nvalidated pipeline with prediction and prospective validation of\nFIGURE 1 |Architecture of the Strainﬂow pipeline.\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8582522\nNagpal et al.

Pre-Emptive Warning Signals COVID-19 Genomes\nsurges 2 months ahead of time. Our empirical experiments\ndemonstrate interpretable features based on Entropy of the\nlatent space of SARS-CoV-2 spike region, thus aiding an early\nwarning system for emergence of new variants of concern and\ncase surges.\nRESULTS\nGenomic Sequence-Based Language\nModelling Captures Emerging Diversity in\nthe SARS-CoV-2 Spike Gene\nOur results validate the idea that a complex combination of codon\nweights may confer evolutionary advantage to the variant. The\ncombinations of weights were learned using state-of-the-art\nunsupervised embeddings for capturing the latent space of\nspike DNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2. The framework of\nStrainﬂow is depicted in the ﬁgure below (Figure 2A). The\nglobal tSNE plot represents dynamic emerging patterns\nderived from latent space representations of spike genes of\nSARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2B) from September, 2020 to March,\n2021, along with speciﬁc geographic locations (country-level)\nsuch as India, United Kingdom, United States, and Brazil.\nTo investigate the information content in the latent space of the\nspike gene learned by our Strainﬂow pipeline, we performed\nqualitative and quantitative analysis on 2.7 million SARS-CoV-2\nspike genes collected from December, 2019 to January, 2022.\nQualitative analysis was performed by performing dimensionality\nreduction with a fast tSNE method called Flt-SNE (Linderman et al.,\n2019). We compared the 2D t-SNE plot of the world with four\ncountries (India, United Kingdom, United States, Brazil) from\nSeptember, 2020 to January, 2022, which clearly highlights the\ndynamic changes in the spike genes across countries in different\nmonths (Figures 2B,C,D). Additionally, quantitative analysis of the\nlatent space was performed by calculating the fast sample entropy of\neach latent dimension (Tomčala, 2020). To compare the monthly\nentropy of the latent dimensions of different geographical regions,\nthe mean entropy was calculated and normalized across the months\nfor each country. We observed the highest entropy (information\ncontent) for India, United Kingdom, United States and Brazil in the\nmonths of February-2021, January-2022, August-2020, and January-\n2022 respectively. Interestingly, we observed high entropy for\n4 months from August, 2020 to November, 2020 in the\nUnited States (Figure 2E). This highlights that the spike protein\nlatent space representation learned byStrainﬂow could be used as a\nproxy to capture the spatiotemporal entropy or diversity in the\nemerging SARS-CoV-2 strains across different countries.\nPreservation of Spatiotemporal Information\nof SARS-CoV-2 Spread Depicted With\nPhylogenetic Analysis\nSequence-level embeddings were obtained from the codon\nembeddings and investigated for the presence of genomically\nmeaningful characteristics. The phylogenetic tree derived from\nthe embeddings for the United Kingdom (Figure 3A) shows two\nclear temporally split clusters for 2020 and 2021 sequences, which\nmay be indicative of different strains in these time periods. The\ntemporality of the collected sequences was found to be preserved\nin the two clusters, although the model was trained only on\ngenome sequences.\nThe phylogenetic tree with globally collected sequences\n(Figure 3B ) demonstrates that geospatial information is\nalso preserved in the sequence embeddings. The\ndendrogram constructed using cosine distance between\nembeddings revealed clear clusters of geospatially close\nregions. Embeddings from geographically close locations\nwere clustered together ( Figure 3 ), and countries closer\ngeographically had similar embedding patterns ( Figure 4 ).\nThis highlights that our de novo embeddings captured these\nsimilarities without the need for standard alignment methods\nor expert knowledge of lineages. Clusters for China (purple),\nAustralia (green), and England (magenta) are highlighted in\nFigure 3B. Strains from Italy, France, Brazil, Japan, Canada,\nUnited States, Scotland, and India were found to be dispersed\nwith other countries. Overall,Strain ﬂow captures the temporal\nemergence of strains and geographic information in a country-\nspeciﬁc manner.\nEntropy in the Latent Space Dimensions\nCaptures Variability in the Spike Gene\nEntropy of a latent dimension has biological signiﬁcance as it\nintuitively captures the variation in codon level changes during\na certain time window. Each latent dimension encodes a\ncombination of codon weights and increase in entropy\nrepresents frequent changes to these weights. Temporal\nchanges in entropy are therefore expected to uncover the\nexplore-exploit cycles of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene changes,\nhence biologically indicative of future trends. To compare\ndifferent geographical regions, the sum of sample entropy\nwas computed for each latent dimension across all the\nmonths. This revealed that certain geospatial regions such\nas France and Germany (Figure 4A) and United States and\nCanada (Figure 4B) have similar total entropies across the\nlatent dimensions, indicating that strains in these regions have\nbeen accumulating similar genomic changes.\nEntropy Dimensions Are Predictive of New\nCOVID-19 Caseloads\nWe then attempted to decipher the relationship between\nmonthly sample entropy and monthly new COVID-19 cases\nin different countries. Detrended cross-correlation coefﬁcient\nwas calculated at different lag values, which revealed that\nentropy dimensions have a leading relationship with new\ncases ( Figures 5A,B ). This suggests that the genome\nsequence data in a given month can be used to predict new\ncases in subsequent months. A lead period of 2 months was\nchosen and Boruta algorithm was employed to assign feature\nimportance scores to different dimensions, which revealed that\ndimension 32 is the most signiﬁcant predictor of new cases\n(Figure 5C). Signiﬁcant dimensions from Boruta analysis were\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8582524\nNagpal et al. Pre-Emptive Warning Signals COVID-19 Genomes\nused for further modeling. Random forest based regression\nmodelling on the predictive features achieved a total\nR-squared of 73% on the validation set. The predicted\ncases were found to be highly correlated with the actual\ncases ( Table 1 ), which suggests that our model can\nindicate the directional change of cases for different\ncountries. Further, the predicted relative change in cases\nbetween successive months was found to be correlated to\nt h ea c t u a lr e l a t i v ec h a n g e s(Supplementary Table S1), which\nsuggests that our model can also indicate the magnitude of\nchange that we expect to observe in the cases.\nOur model can be therefore used to predict the COVID-19\ncaseloads in several countries. Both United States (Figure 6A)\nand Japan (Figure 6C) show an increase in the sample entropy\nacross the time period April–June 2021, concurrent with the\nrespective spreads in these countries. Our model predicts new\ncaseloads with a 2-month lead time, which strongly predicts a\nspike in new cases both in United States ( Figure 6B )a n d\nJapan (Figure 6D) in the months of July and August, 2021. For\nIndia our model predicted a decline in the number of cases for\nthe month of July and August, 2021 (Figures 6E,F). Therefore\nour model may be used as an epidemiological early warning\nsystem to predict new caseloads.\nCodons Associated With the Predictive\nFeatures Could Be Linked to SARS-CoV-2\nVariants\nWe further assessed the potential link of the predictive features\nwith SARS-COV-2 variants by extracting the top 10\ncontributing codons and their associated weights for each\ndimension (Supplementary Table S2 ). The intuition behind\nthis idea is that the codons with high weights in a given\ndimension, when mutated in the viral sequence, are likely to\nFIGURE 3 |Phylogenetic trees constructed using cosine similarities between 400 randomly sampled sequence embeddings.(A) Dendrogram for strains from the\nUnited Kingdom: Cluster 1 (blue) contains strains from the period October 2020– December 2020, while Cluster 2 (orange) contains strains collected between January\n2021– March 2021.

Pre-Emptive Warning Signals COVID-19 Genomes\ncause a signiﬁcant change in the entropy of the associated\ndimensions. Therefore each predictive feature can be linked to\ncodons, which can further be mapped to Variants of concern\n(VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs) ( Supplementary\nTable S3). Despite the fact that our model cannot directly\ncapture the SARS-CoV-2 vari ants, it was observed that\ndimension-32 captures the CTG, CGG codons (ranks 5 and\n8 respectively), known to be involved in the mutation T19R.\nSimilarly, dimension 3 captures three codons (ACG, CGG,\nCAC) that are associated with multiple variants such as K417T,\nL452R, and D1118H, causing increased infectivity,\npathogenicity, and spread. Dimension 30 captures codons\nCAT and CAC associated with Δ69 and D1118H\nrespectively which are linked to B.1.1.7 lineage.\nCodon weights ( Supplementary Table S2 ) of a given\npredictive feature provide an opportunity to associate with\nspeci ﬁc Variants of concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest\n(VOIs), and to predict emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nDistinct dimensions capture country-speci ﬁcc h a n g e sa n d\nmay be surveilled to monitor the spread of the pandemic.\nThis approach was back-validated with several real-world\nexamples. For instance, dimension 32 captures the codons\nCGG (R) and CAC (R), which are found in B.1.429 lineage\n(L425R mutation). Dimension 3 captures CGG which is seen\nin L452R (associated with lineage B.1.617.1), which was ﬁrst\nobserved in India in December 2020 and was found to have\nincreased infectivity and transmissibility.\nProspective Validation of the Model in the\nDelta and Omicron Surges Revealed\nInterpretable Predictive Features\nFor investigating the potential of our predictive features to\ntrack the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we used the codon level\ninformation of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant for the spike\ngene and extracted the weights of these codons speci ﬁct o\neach feature. We selected Dimensions 3, 4, 12, 13, 15, 16, 25,\n28, 30, 32 with high absolute weights for the codons related\nto the delta variants ( Figure 7A ). The entropy of these\nfeatures was contrasted wit h the caseloads in England\n(Figure 7B ), India ( Figure 7C ) ,a n dU n i t e dS t a t e s\n(Figure 7D ). Overall, the temporal tracking of these\nfeatures may be used as a surrogate to track the spread of\nvarious SAR-CoV-2 variants.\nOur case prediction model was frozen in June, 2021 and\nprospectively predicted the caseloads from July, 2021 to\nDecember, 2021. Our model predicted the case upsurge in\nIndia due to the Omicron variant in November, and\nDecember, 2021 ( Figure 7E ) 2 months ahead of time.\nAlthough the model fails to predict the exact values of\ncases, it is useful as a trend indicator. Further, we observe\nexplore-exploit cycles in the entropy-space of India prior to\nt h ec a s ep e a kd u et ot h eD e l t av a r i a n ti nM a y ,2 0 2 1\n(Figure 7F ). A similar exploration phase can be observed\nfor the months from September–November, 2021, which may\nbe indicative of an upcoming case peak driven by the Omicron\nvariant.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have implemented an approach for analyzing the emerging\nstrains based on the latent space of spike protein coding\nnucleotide sequences. We chose the nucleotide sequences\ninstead of proteins in order to capture and track the variations\nthat may not have immediate functional consequences. Our\napproach has two main underlying tenets: 1) long-range\ninteractions are known to modulate the functional interaction\nbetween receptor binding domain and ACE2 receptors, hence\nmay be captured in the NLP models that capture 3-mer changes\nand context, and 2) latent dimensions may be differentially\ncorrelated with indicators of spread, thus providing a data-\ndriven handle for tracking and predicting variants of concern\nand variants of interest (Mugnai et al., 2020). The pipeline takes\nadvantage of temporal changes in the semantics of mutating\nsequences. Preservation of phylogenetic structure based upon the\nsimilarity matrix obtained using the embeddings validated that\nthe latent dimensions capture spatio-temporal information.\nAnalyzing the dynamic patterns and underlying correlations in\nthe 30,000 base pair long sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is important\nto highlight the mechanistic understanding of mutations (Shishir\net al., 2021). SARS-CoV-2 seems to show a particularly high\nfrequency of recombinations arising due to the absence of a\nproof-reading mechanism and sequence diversity, which calls for\nurgency in studying its transmission pattern (Rouchka et al.,\n2020; Mandal et al., 2021). Therefore predicting mutations in the\nspike protein, which binds to ACE2 receptors can help us\nestimate the spread of disease and the efﬁcacy of therapeutic\ntreatments and vaccines (Li et al., 2020; Srivastava et al., 2021).\nWhile most research studies have attempted to predict the\nexact number of cases and have failed, our work is focussed on\nearly prediction of trends from a non-obvious source of data.\nUnlike obvious data sources, the inter-relationships between\ncodons in genome sequences are complex and less likely to be\ninﬂuenced or biased. Furthermore, sequencing data are made\nroutinely available via various national and global consortia for\ngenomic surveillance of SARS-CoV2. Our study also highlights\nthe potential for triangulating insights from completely unrelated\ndatasets, an approach that is expected to eliminate systematic\nbiases in reporting by independent organizations. Further studies\nmay triangulate insights from disparate, heterogeneous datasets\nsuch as mobility, genome surveillance, testing and case\npredictions to partially solve the problem of biases in\nindividual datasets.\nEntropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. We\nhypothesized that mutations increase the chaotic dynamics in\nthe latent space of spike genes. To calculate entropy, we used the\naccelerated versions of the Approximate Entropy and Sample\nEntropy algorithms, called Fast Approximate Entropy and Fast\nSample Entropy ( Tomčala, 2020 ). Both algorithms aim to\nquantify how often different patterns of data are found in a\ntime series. Fast Approximate Entropy, however, is a biased\nstatistic and depends on the length of the series. Since we\ncould have different counts of genome sequences collected\neach month, we preferred Sample Entropy, which is\nindependent of the length of the series. Entropy values were\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8582529\nNagpal et al. Pre-Emptive Warning Signals COVID-19 Genomes\ncalculated for each latent dimension in each month. Thereafter,\nDetrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) was performed\nbetween the entropy dimensions and the new cases (Prass and\nPumi, 2020b). DCCA is a modiﬁcation of the standard cross-\ncorrelation analysis for ﬁnding relationships between non-\nstationary time series. High cross-correlation for different lead\nperiods revealed that the entropy values in a given month could\nbe used to predict the new cases in different countries in\nsubsequent months. Different countries had different lead\ntimes at which the highest cross-correlation was observed\nbetween the entropy dimensions and the cases, ranging from 1\nto 6 months. Overall, a lead time of 2 months was chosen to\nmodel the new cases. An empirical analysis was also done with\ndaily values of entropy and new cases. Entropy was calculated in\nrolling windows, and cross-correlation analysis was performed\nbetween entropy and new cases at different lead periods.\nAlthough the cross-correlation values were found to be\nsigniﬁcant, the values were low and ranged between −0.1 to\n0.1. Therefore, we decided to use the monthly entropy values\nfor the modelling exercise.\nTo predict new COVID-19 cases, a random forest regression\nmodel was trained on the monthly entropy data. With sample\nentropy, we achieved an R-squared value of 73% on the validation\nset, while with approximate entropy, the value was only 10%.\nTherefore the model trained on sample entropy was selected. The\npredictions from the model were found to be highly correlated\nwith the actual cases, indicating that our model can be used for\npreemptive warning signals for the rise in cases in different\ncountries. Further, the actual and the predicted difference in\nthe number of cases in consecutive months was found to be\ncorrelated, which suggests that the relative change in the cases in\nconsecutive months predicted by our model is linked to the\nrelative change in the number of cases. Overall, we\nrecommend that our model be used to predict dangerous\ntrends and not the actual number of cases. Further, the\nmapping from latent dimensions to Variants of Concern\n(VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs) may help us track the\ncountry-speciﬁc spread of different variants.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a dynamically evolving\nscenario, with new strains emerging and vaccines being\ndeveloped. With the SARS-CoV-2 genome constantly\nmutating, we anticipate an underlying change in the grammar\nof the sequence, underpinning the need to update our language\nmodel every few months. Further, the regression model for\ncaseloads needs to be periodically retrained too. An empirical\nanalysis led us to discover that the Random forest model used for\nprospective validation from November, 2021 onwards performed\nbetter in terms of predicting the number of cases than the model\nused for prospective validation from July 2021 (Supplementary\nFigure S2). However, both models indicate similar trends in cases\nfor most countries.\nFurther, models trained on genomic sequences can be used for\npredicting infection severity based on Co-associations between\nthe SNPs of Co-morbid Diseases and COVID-19 (Wang et al.,\n2020b). The machine learning models can also be trained on\ngenomic sequences for COVID-19 classiﬁcation (Arslan, 2021).\nAlthough the variance explained by our model is low, however,\nwe were able to compute the variability associated with spike\nprotein mutations. So our method showed a potential way to\nestimate the new cases variability associated with spike protein\nmutations. Our methods can be incorporated with the epidemic\nprojections model to better predict the epidemic trajectories. The\nlatent dimensions may further be employed to predict the clinical\nconsequences of emerging strains. The currently available\nvaccines are intended for early SARS-CoV-2 strains, but with\nnew emerging variants, immune responses triggered by these\nvaccines may be weaker and short-lived. As seen in the\ndevastating second wave of the pandemic in India, newer\nSARS-CoV-2 variants have acquired an increased pathogenic\npotential resulting in rapid clinical progression and\noverwhelmed health systems. Mitigating such events in the\nfuture will require stronger surveillance systems in place. Our\nstudy offers a promising solution in this direction and lays the\nfoundation for proactive genomic surveillance of COVID-19.\nOur study has the following limitations. Our approach of\ncodon embeddings does not indicate the position where the\ncodon change may have happened in the spike gene. This is\nbecause low-dimensional embeddings do not preserve the\npositional encoding of words. However, we are investigating\nadvanced approaches such as complex-valued word\nembeddings with positional encodings and transformer models\nsuch as BERT to overcome our current limitations (Wang et al.,\n2020a; Lee et al., 2020; Wolf et al., 2020). The latter are considered\nexpensive and data-hungry models and it will remain to be\nevaluated if the gain of positional information may be\ncountered by the loss of prediction accuracy for forecasting\nnew cases in the future. However, we believe that the\navailability of sequences for a wide variety of viral pathogens\npresents an exciting opportunity to train data-hungry models that\nmay be able to transfer insights across pathogens and yet remain\ninterpretable. Further, our Strainﬂow model is trained only on the\nspike gene of the viral genome, which does not represent the\ncomplete variation spectrum of the virus. To mitigate this\nshortcoming, we will develop a genome-level Strainﬂow\npipeline for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the present study does\nnot consider the interaction between the spike gene and other\ngenes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We have not considered the\ninteraction between the ACE2 receptor sequence for the human\nand the spike gene sequences due to the unavailability of such\nlarge-scale paired data. However, we believe this is a strength of\nour study as we were able to extract relevant features as well as\nmake valid predictions using the spike region of the SARS-CoV-2\ngene alone.\nOur current approach does not explicitly capture speciﬁc\npositional mutations. Although the ad-hoc analysis for codon\nweights on signiﬁcant dimensions allows us to rank the codon\nlevel changes, the predictive feature is a complex nonlinear\ncombination of these changes which may eliminate strongly\nassociated features. The E484Q mutation was not captured as\nthe most important in our model. However, this may be\nbecause other codon level changes such as L452R and their\ncombinations may be correlated and hence a proxy for E484Q.\nImportantly, the B.1.617 variant has both L452R and E484Q\nmutations and L452R change was predictive and captured in\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 85825210\nNagpal et al. Pre-Emptive Warning Signals COVID-19 Genomes\nthe top ten ranks for multiple latent dimensions (3, 4, 10, 12,\n13, 15, 16).\nFinally, a relatively small number of samples were used to\nconstruct the supervised predictive model for case prediction. As\nmore data becomes available in subsequent months, we can\nproduce more con ﬁdent case predictions. An empirical\nvalidation depicted that we require a minimum of 100 samples\nper month for calculating the sample entropy. This also\nunderscores the need for a more reliable and agile approach to\ndeposit country-level datasets on repositories such as GISAID.\nWe make an appeal to the countries to facilitate the sharing of\nsuch data in order to be prepared for any future waves of the\ncurrent pandemic and for preventing the new emergence of\nstrains. We believe our study is an instance of the new\nparadigm of pathogen surveillance using a novel language\nmodelling approach that is potentially scalable to infectious\ndisease surveillance and antimicrobial resistance.\nMETHODS\nDatasets\nTraining dataset: The dataset was downloaded from GISAID\nEpiCoV (April 8, 2021 release) (Shu and McCauley, 2017). 0.36\nmillion genome sequences (December, 2019–June, 2021) with\nhigh nucleotide completeness, coverage, complete temporal\ninformation, and presence of less than 5% non-identi ﬁed\nnucleotide bases (N) were downloaded. The sequences\nincluded 63 countries, including India, United Kingdom,\nUnited States, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Russia, Italy,\nFrance, Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, Pakistan, Bangladesh,\nIran, Iraq, the continent of South America, and Africa.\nDuplicate samples were removed, and whole genome\nsequences were parsed using CoV-Seq to extract nucleotide\nsequences corresponding to each of the 12 Coding DNA\nSequences (Liu et al., 2020). Accession IDs that did not cover\n12 coding regions were discarded, yielding 0.31 million high-\nquality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences for language modelling.\nThe spike gene region of each sequence wasﬁltered and used for\nall subsequent analysis. We downloaded country-wise COVID-19\ndata for new cases from a publicly available repository maintained\nby Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and\nEngineering (JHU CSSE).\nEvaluation dataset: We downloaded around 0.6 million\ngenome sequences submitted to GISAID from April 2021 to\nJune 2021. We used our trained model to predict the latent\nrepresentations for these sequences.\nWord Embeddings in Strainﬂow Pipeline\nIn our Strainﬂow pipeline, we have adopted a word2vec model\n(Mikolov et al., 2013). Low dimensional representations for the\ngenome sequences were learned using the word2vec model. Non-\noverlapping sequences of 3-mers (codons) were considered as\nwords for training the model, which was implemented in Gensim\n(Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010). The skip-gram algorithm was used,\nwith aﬁxed window size of twenty and vector size of thirty-six.\nFor generating a consensus embedding for a particular strain,\ngenomic sequences were represented by taking the mean of each\ncodon occurring in the sequence dimension-wise. The mean was\ncalculated by summing across all the k-mers over each dimension\nand then dividing it by the total number of codons present in the\nsequence. For selecting the dimension size for our word\nembeddings, we calculated the PIP (Pairwise Inner Product)\nloss (Yin and Shen, 2018 ). PIP loss is a metric used for\ncalculating the dissimilarity between two word embedding\nmatrices. For the embedding matrix of strains (E), the PIP\nmatrix is deﬁned as the dot product of the embedding matrix\nwith its transpose (E.E\nT). The PIP loss between two embedding\nmatrices is deﬁned as the norm of the difference between their\nPIP matrices.\n||PIP(E1) − PIP(E2)|| /equals\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐⏐E1ET\n1 − E2ET\n2\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\n/equals\n/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext /radicaltpext\n∑\ni,j\n((v (1)\ni ,v (1)\nj )− (v (2)\ni ,v (2)\nj ))\n2\n√\nVarious word2vec models were trained on the dataset with\ndifferent vector sizes varying in multiples of three. Based on the\nPIP loss calculations, we found out that word embeddings with 36\ndimensions showed a differential dent in the curve (change in\nstraight line), due to which we selected this to be the dimension of\nthe word embeddings (Supplementary Figure S1).\nPhylogenetic Analysis Using the Latent\nDimensions of the Spike Genes\nTo evaluate the phylogenetic properties based on the latent\ndimensions of the spike gene, we computed the cosine\ndistances among spike genes of SARS-CoV-2 with the 36\nlatent dimensions. The pairwise distance was further used for\nhierarchical clustering using the‘hclust’function in R statistical\nprogramming language. This analysis was performed using 400\nrandom sequences of spike genes from 16 countries. The\nvisualization of the phylogenetic tree derived based on the\nlatent dimensions was done using“iTOL” software (Figure 2)\n(Letunic and Bork, 2021).\nEntropy of the Latent Dimensions\nTo quantify the properties of latent dimensions, we have used a\nwell-known information theory based algorithm suitable for time\nseries datasets, called“Fast Sample Entropy” (Pan et al., 2011). To\ncompute Fast Sample Entropy, we have used the“FastSampEn”\nfunction in the“TSEntropies” package in R (Tomcala, 2018). Fast\nSample Entropy can be computed as follows.\nFastSampEn(x, m, r) /equals log⎛⎝ ∑\nNm\ni/equals 1\n⏐⏐\n⏐⏐s\ni,m\n⏐⏐\n⏐⏐丨 ∑\nNm+1\ni/equals 1\n⏐⏐\n⏐⏐s\ni,m+1\n⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⎞⎠,\nwhere,\ns\ni,m /equals {ξ | (∥ yi − yξ ∥ ≤ r, ξ ≠ i)∧ (ξ ∉ sj,m,j < i)},y i\n/equals [xi,x i+1, ..., xi+m−1]\nsi,m is a set of sub-sequences of length m belonging to the i-th\nneighbourhood, and\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 85825211\nNagpal et al. Pre-Emptive Warning Signals COVID-19 Genomes\nNm is the number of these neighbourhoods.\nIn our case,“x” is the latent dimension of the spike genes of\nthe SARS-CoV-2 strains per month for a given country with\ndefault values of“m” and “r.” Entropy was computed for each\nlatent dimension on a monthly basis for each country. To\ncompare geographies across months, we used average entropy\nderived from 36 latent dimensions, followed by normalization\nusing all the monthly entropies for a given country\n(Figure 1D ). To compare the entropy of the latent\ndimensions among countries, we used the total entropy of\nthe country for each dimension and visualized it with line\ngraphs (Figure 3).\nDetrended Cross Correlations Analysis\nTo investigate the information content (entropy) of the latent\ndimensions with the new cases observed for COVID-19, we used\nthe Detrended Cross Correlation Analysis ( Prass and Pumi,\n2020b) Here, DCCA captures the long-range cross correlation\nbetween time series (entropy of the months and caseloads for a\ngiven country). We tested both time series for stationarity using\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (Mushtaq, 2011). The ADF\ntest was implemented using the function“adf.test” available in the\n“tseries” package in R (Trapletti et al., 2020). Due to the non-\nstationary distribution of the estimated entropies and the\ncaseloads for a given country, we used the“DCCA” R package\n(Prass and Pumi, 2020a ). Cross-correlation was calculated\nbetween the entropy dimensions at time t +h and new cases\nat time t, whereh = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3... ±10.\nMachine Learning Based Identiﬁcation of\nSigniﬁcant Predictive Features\nCountry-wise monthly total new cases data was taken at the end\nof each month. Total new cases data for each month was merged\nto monthly entropy dimensions data from March, 2020 to June,\n2021. We used a regression based machine learning approach\ncalled “Boruta,” a wrapper algorithm around a random forest\nalgorithm to select the most relevant entropy dimensions for the\nprediction of subsequent 2 months’new cases(Kursa et al., 2010;\nKursa and Rudnicki, 2020). We used the default parameters with\nthe modiﬁcation of the maximum runs as 1,000. We selected the\nconﬁrmed entropy dimensions as the most relevant predictive\nfeatures for the prediction of new-cases.\nModel Development and Evaluation for\nPrediction of New Cases in Subsequent\nMonths\nTo predict the new cases in the next to next months, we used a\nregression based random forest model using the most relevant\npredictive features using the “Boruta” R package (Kursa and\nRudnicki, 2020 ). The model training was performed using\nentropy data from March, 2020 to February, 2021; and the\nﬁtted model was validated on entropy data from March, 2021\nto April, 2021. The regression modelling was performed using\n1,000 decision trees using the“randomForest” package in R (Liaw\nand Wiener, 2002).\nTop Codons Associated With Predictive\nFeatures\nTo ﬁnd the top codons associated with the latent dimensions,\nwe extracted the absolute weights of each codon for a given\ndimension. The top 10 codons having the highest absolute\nweights (contribution) were identiﬁed corresponding to each\ndimension to link these to SARS-CoV-2 variants. We collected\nthe SARS-CoV-2 variants and their associated genetic\nvariations at the codon level linked to the spike gene, and a\nlist of codons associated with VOIs and VOCs was curated\n(Supplementary Table S4); (Lopez-Rincon et al., 2021; Naveca\net al., 2021; Peacock et al., 2021; Srivastava et al., 2021; CDC,\n2022). The curated list is based on the CDC guidelines, and we\nare consistent with their de ﬁnition of lineage and variant\n(CDC, 2022).\nStrainﬂow Algorithm\nThe algorithm for the Strainﬂow pipeline has been described\nbelow:\n1. We have collected the SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the\nGISAID EpiCoV database. High quality sequences with\ncomplete temporal information were ﬁltered.\n2. We extracted the spike gene region of these sequences from\nFASTA ﬁles using the CoV-Seq tool. A CSV containing\nthese sequences and other metadata such as country names\nand dates was created.\n3. The sequences were splitted into chunks of three characters\n(codons). A splitted sequence represents a document with\nthree-letter words.\n4. We trained a word2Vec model on the spike gene sequences for\nlearning 36-dimensional word embeddings. The average of all\nword embeddings in a given sequence was treated as the\nembedding of the sequence.\n5. We calculated the sample entropies of each dimension of our\nembeddings for each month and country.\n6. New COVID-19 cases for each country in each month were\ncalculated using data from the JHU CSSE repository.\n7. A feature selection algorithm (Boruta) was used for selecting\nthe entropy dimensions predictive of caseloads 2 months in\nadvance.\n8. Random Forest regression algorithm was used for predicting\nnew cases 2 months ahead of time. The inputs to the model are\nthe country names and important features extracted from the\nBoruta algorithm. The predictor variable is the caseload\n2 months ahead of time for each country.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
