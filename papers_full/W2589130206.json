These \nimages contain a wealth of information about the crystal \nstructure of a material. Specifically:\n1. The position of the atom columns in high angle annu-\nlar dark field (HAADF) images can be determined \nquantitatively and used for structure solution [ 3–6], \nand the determination of the structure of defects [7].\n2. The position of the atom columns can be used to get \nlocal changes of lattice parameters [8].\n3. In HAADF-STEM, the intensity of an atomic column \nis related to the atomic number of the elements in the \natomic columns and the number of atoms in the col -\numns [ 9]. Simulations are often needed to interpret \nthe intensity quantitatively as there are complicating \neffects from sample orientation [ 10], material phase \n[10], defects [ 11], and strain [ 11] in the material. By \ncombining HAADF-STEM with simulations, one can \nextract compositional and thickness information, in \nsome cases even counting all the atoms [10].\n4. Even information about the structure parallel to the \nelectron beam can be inferred from the shape of the \ncolumns [13].\nWith the wealth of information in these images, having \nrobust and quantitative methods for analysing them is \njust as important as acquiring them.\nThe work in this paper is performed using the perovs -\nkite structure, although the principles could be used for \nmany other crystal structures. The perovskite structure \nOpen Access\n*Correspondence:  magnunor@gmail.com \n2 SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow,  \nGlasgow, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 12Nord et al. Adv Struct Chem Imag  (2017) 3:9 \nderives from the mineral CaTiO3 and the generic formula \nof a perovskite oxide is ABO 3; the simplest form of the \nstructure is a primitive cubic structure with the A-sites \nat the corners, the B-sites at the body center, and the \nO-sites at the face centers of each cell.\nIIn addition to the aforementioned STEM-HAADF \nimaging, which is best for heavier elements, it is also \nimportant to be able to image and quantify the positions \nof lighter elements. For example, in perovskite oxides it is \nvital to be able to accurately map the position of the oxy\n-\ngen columns [14]. In recent years, STEM imaging using \neither bright field (BF) [8, 15, 16] or annular bright field \n(ABF) [17, 18]  conditions has been useful for revealing \noxygen atom columns in such oxides.\nOf special interest is the oxygen structure across inter\n-\nfaces in heterostructures [19], since this is very hard to \nprobe with other techniques. In perovskite oxides, the \noxygen positions can be used to infer the oxygen octa\n-\nhedral tilting pattern [20], which is important for under -\nstanding the macroscopic functional properties of the \nmaterial, and may well be affected by constraints from \ncoherent interfaces [8, 18].\nA commonly used method for quantifying changes in \nlattice parameter is geometrical phase analysis (GPA) \n[21]. GPA is based on Fourier transforming atomic \nresolution images and placing masks around two non-\ncollinear Bragg spots. Historically, this method has \nbeen used with high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) [21, \n22]. However, with the advent of STEM aberration cor\n-\nrectors, it has also seen extensive use on STEM-images \n[5, 6, 23]. While this is a fast and easy way to calculate \ndeformation of a lattice, it can introduce artefacts [24] \nand the spatial resolution is limited to 1 unit cell [23] \ndue to it being based on Fourier transforming the image \ndata. Ideally, it would be preferable to use real space \nmethods, which do not require the use of Fourier trans\n-\nforms. One possibility is to use the center of mass for \neach bright column which is usually robust [25], but this \nhas the limitation that it only gives the center positions \nof the atomic columns. Alternatively, the fitting of a 2-D \nGaussian to the bright column will give the width, ellip\n-\nticity, amplitude, and more precise center position [25]. \nHowever, for this to work successfully, reasonable initial \nvalues are needed.\nSeveral software tools for real space analysis exist: \nRanger [26], qHAADF [27], iMtools [28], StatSTEM [29], \nand Oxygen octahedra picker [30]. These methods have \nbeen used in several works: using center of mass com\n-\nbined with principal component analysis (PCA) [13], pat-\ntern matching [31], iMtools using 2-D Gaussians [4, 32], \nand MATLAB with the Image Processing Toolbox [10]. \nRecent work has also used computer vision-based tech\n-\nniques to characterize the local structure [33].\nSince STEM-images can show several thousand atomic \ncolumns, automation is an important aspect for analysis \nmethods. Ideally, such methods should require as lit\n-\ntle manual input as possible, since this allows analysis \nof large images containing several thousand atomic col\n-\numns. This is important for three reasons: (i) the more \ninformation, the better, (ii) researcher time is valuable, \ncomputing time is cheap, (iii) large sample sizes allows \nfor a more statistical approach to data analysis. The \nautomation should ideally do the peak finding and posi\n-\ntion refinements. In addition, it should also construct \nrelations between the atoms. For example, for an image \nof a monocrystalline material, the atoms belonging to \nthe same monolayer should automatically be identified. \nThis enables rapid analysis of parameters like distances \nbetween monolayers, and changes in lattice parameters.\nIn addition, this framework should be free and open \nsource [34]. This avoids the processing steps being hid\n-\nden in a “black box” , and allows for other researchers to \nimprove and extend the functionality.\nIn this work, we present Atomap, a new free and open \nsource software package for automatic analysis of the \nposition and shape of atomic columns in STEM-images. \nUsing a variety of peak finding and position refinements, \neven light elements, such as oxygen, can be accurately \nquantified. We start by outlining the method by show\n-\ning the different processing steps on a SrTiO 3 (STO) \nsubstrate. Next, the method is applied to extract struc -\ntural information from different perovskite oxide het -\nerostructures. In particular, the position of sublattices in \nthe crystal structure, the shape of atomic columns, and \nsuperstructures in oxygen atomic planes are determined.\nComputational and experimental methods\nThe focus of this work is the analysis of atomic resolu -\ntion STEM-images of perovskite oxides. As mentioned \nearlier, these materials are in the form of ABO\n3. The \nA-site is a larger cation like strontium or lanthanum, the \nsmaller B-site is typically a transition metal like manga\n-\nnese or titanium, and the O is oxygen. A-site cations are \nusually the heaviest element in the structure, the B-site \ncations the second heaviest, and oxygen the lightest. The \nheterostructures studied were La\n0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) \non LaFeO3 (LFO) on (111)-oriented Nb-doped STO and \nLSMO on (111)-oriented Nb-doped STO. TEM samples \nwere prepared as thin sections perpendicular to the [1\n1\n0]-direction of the STO. Deposition [35, 36] of the films \nand the preparation of the TEM specimens [37] are \ndescribed in more detail elsewhere.\nAn example of a typical STEM image is shown in \nFig. 1 (top left). The first aim of the method is to extract \nthe position and shape for all the different atomic col\n-\numns in these kinds of images. Second, we want to find \nPage 3 of 12\nNord et al.

Adv Struct Chem Imag  (2017) 3:9 \nthe relations between the different atomic columns. \nIn essence, the process of fitting one sublattice can be \nsummed up in three steps: (i) Find the positions of all \nthe atomic columns you want to examine. (ii) Refine the \npositions using center of mass until they are close enough \nfor the 2-D Gaussian fitting to work robustly. (iii) Fit the \natomic columns using a 2-D elliptical Gaussian function \nI(x, y). This is defined by the following:\nwhere I0 is the background, A the amplitude, x0 ,y0  the \ncenter positions, σx, σy the standard deviations, and θ \nthe rotation. The background I0 is set to the minimum \nintensity value of the region around the atomic column. \nThis way of setting the background value is easy and \nrobust. However, it has some drawbacks in that a single \npixel with low value due to some kind of artefact can \nlead to the background varying greatly between the dif\n-\nferent atomic columns. One way of improving this is by \nhaving the background as a parameter while fitting the \n2-D Gaussians; however, this reduces the robustness as \nthe chance of poor fitting increases. Therefore, in this \nwork, the simpler minimum value method was used, as \nit worked well in practice. More advanced forms of back\n-\nground subtraction will be implemented in Atomap in \nthe future.\nAdditional sublattices are found by having a priori \ncrystallographic knowledge on where they are located in \nrelation to the first sublattice, as explained below.\nInitial positions and refinements\nTo exemplify this, we show the procedure to find the \npositions of all sublattices in an STO crystal projected \nalong the [1\n10]-direction. While this demonstrates \nthe use of this method on a specific crystal structure \nalong a specific projection, the software should work \nfor any kind of atomic structure or projection, as long \nas the atomic columns are clearly resolved. Comments \non how to adapt this for other structures and projec\n-\ntions are outlined in \" Adapting for other structures and \nprojections\".\n(1)\nI(x,y) = I0 + A exp\n(\n−\n(\na(x − x0 )2 − 2b(x − x0 )\n(y − y0 ) + c(y − y0 )2\n))\na = cos2 θ\n2σ 2x\n+ sin2 θ\n2σ 2y\nb =− sin 2θ\n4σ 2x\n+ sin 2θ\n4σ 2y\nc = sin2 θ\n2σ 2x\n+ cos2 θ\n2σ 2y\nA‑cations\nFirst, the original ADF image (Fig.  1, top left) is filtered. \nThis involves doing a local averaging, where a Gaussian \nconvolution of the image is made and subtracted from \nthe original image. Next, 1-D PCA [38] denoises the \nmodified image to reduce random noise. The outcome \nis a filtered ADF image with smaller intensity variations \nand less noise. The A-cations in the filtered ADF image \nare located using a peak finding method which finds the \nmost intense local features, where each feature has to \nbe separated by a minimum distance. This filtered ADF \nimage is only used for the initial peak finding, all sub\n-\nsequent position refinement is done using the original, \nunfiltered, ADF image.\nNext, these initial A-cation positions are refined using \nthe original ADF image. This is done by finding the \ncenter of mass for a circular area centered at the current \nposition with a radius of 40% of the distance to the clos\n-\nest A-cation neighbor. The result of this refinement is \nshown in the “ A-cation positions” image in Fig.  1. These \nA-cation positions are used as the initial values for fitting \n2-D Gaussians to every A-cation atomic column in the \noriginal ADF image.\nThe refined positions of the A-cations are the input \nparameters to further study the average 2-D atomic \narrangement of the structure. For each A-cation, the \ndistance and direction to the ten nearest neighbors are \ncalculated. Next, using a similar peak finding process as \nexplained earlier, all the repeating nearest neighbors are \nfound. The “Nearest neighbor statistics” to the bottom left \nin Fig.  1 shows the real space nearest neighbor distance \nand direction, which gives information similar to an FFT: \nthe average 2-D arrangement of atoms in a small repeating \nunit of this specific projection of the 3-D crystal structure. \nUsing different planes visible in the image (i.e., perpendic\n-\nular to the beam direction), atom columns which belong \nto the same atom planes are grouped. These atom planes \nare defined in the software by the vector perpendicular to \nthe trace of the plane in the image. Thus, the atom planes \nshown in Fig.  1 (bottom left) are the (110) atom planes. \nThe traces of these atom planes run in the [001]-direction.\nB‑cations\nFitting Gaussians to the B-cations is more challenging, \ndue to the A-cations being more intense. To get robust \nfitting of the B-cations, the intensity from the A-cations \nis removed from the original ADF image before start\n-\ning the B-cation fitting. This is done by subtracting the \n2-D Gaussians fitted to the A-cations. The original ADF \nimage with the A-cations subtracted is shown in the top \ncenter of Fig.  1. This leaves the B-cations as the most \nintense feature in the ADF image.\nPage 5 of 12\nNord et al. Adv Struct Chem Imag  (2017) 3:9 \nThe initial positions of the B-cation atomic columns \nare placed between each A-cation pair in the (110) atom \nplanes. This is shown for one A-cation atom plane in \nFig.  1 (bottom left), with the B-cation initial positions \nmarked with red circles.\nWith the initial B-cation positions and the ADF image \nwith the A-cations removed, the B-cation positions are \nrefined using center of mass the same way as for the \nA-cations. The refined positions are used as the initial \nvalues when doing Gaussian fitting for the B-cations. The \n2-D repeating units and atomic planes for the B-cations \nare constructed in the same way as for the A-cations. This \nprocess is shown in the middle column of Fig.  1, where \nthe resulting B-cation (001) atom planes are shown.\nOxygen\nThe rightmost column in Fig.  1 shows how the oxy -\ngen positions are determined. The oxygen initial posi -\ntions are placed between each pair of B-cations in the \n(001) atom planes, shown with the blue circles in the \nlower center image in Fig.  1. In ADF imaging, the oxy\n-\ngen is much less intense compared to the heavier A and \nB cations, so ABF imaging is utilized. Such an image is \nshown to the top right in Fig.  1 (original ABF), which \nhas been acquired simultaneously with the ADF image. \nIn the ABF image, the oxygen is visible, but still the least \nintense of the atomic columns. Using the initial A and B \ncation positions from the ADF image, 2-D Gaussians are \nfitted to the A and B cations in the ABF image and sub\n-\ntracted. The image contrast is further inverted, to create \na modified ABF image where the oxygen columns are the \nmost intense features in the image. Using this modified \nABF image and the initial oxygen positions, the posi\n-\ntions are refined using the center of mass, further refined \nusing 2-D Gaussians, 2-D repeating units found, and the \natomic planes constructed.\nThe end result gives the location of all the atom col\n-\numns in the image, as shown to the lower right in Fig. 1.\nFinding distances between atomic columns\nHaving an accurate position for all the atomic columns is \nthe first step toward making measurements of distances \nbetween columns or interplanar spacings. Having already \ngrouped the atom columns into atomic planes, it is trivial \nto find the spacings in the (001)- and (110)-planes. The \ndistances between neighboring atomic columns in the \n(001)-planes correspond to the (110) interplanar spacing \nas these are orthogonal (Fig.  2a). Similarly, the interpla\n-\nnar distances for the (110)-planes are found using the dis-\ntances between the atomic columns in the (001)-planes. \nThe case is less straightforward for (111)-planes, as \nneighboring atomic columns (of the same cation type) \nalong the orthogonal (11\n2)-plane will be three monolay -\ners apart. The interplanar spacing is the distance between \none monolayer and its neighbor. To find this, a line is \ninterpolated through the atomic columns in a (111)-\nplane. From an atomic column in the neighboring (111)-\nplane, the shortest distance from the atomic column to \nthis line is found. This is the (111) interplanar spacing \nat this point, as shown to the bottom right in Fig.  2a. \nRepeating this for every atomic column and its neighbor \natom plane gives a 2-D map of the monolayer distances.\nFig. 2 Quantifying distances between atomic planes. a Distances between Sr atomic planes in different directions. Showing how finding the \ndistance between atomic planes is straightforward for the [001] and [110] directions, but not for the [111] direction. b Calculating displacement \n(D) from a centrosymmetric position between atomic columns, here shown on oxygen columns. The inset shows how the distance difference is \ncalculated for oxygen atoms in the [001]-direction for an LFO film. The distance to the next (N) and previous (P) atom is calculated, as shown with \nthe green and red double headed arrows\nPage 6 of 12Nord et al. Adv Struct Chem Imag  (2017) 3:9 \nIn the perovskites, a common structural change is unit \ncell doubling along a specific direction as a result of oxy -\ngen octahedral tilting [20]. Depending on the tilt pattern, \nthis will result in the oxygen columns shifting. An exam -\nple of this is shown in Fig.  2b, where there is an obvi -\nous oxygen superstructure along the black line signified \nby alternating distances between the oxygen columns in \nthe [001]-direction. One useful way of quantifying this \nis finding how much the oxygen atom deviates from the \ncentrosymmetric position in a cubic perovskite structure. \nThis displacement, D, is found by determining the dis\n-\ntance from an atom to the next (N) and the previous (P) \natoms in the atom plane, and divide the difference (N−P) \nby 4. This gives the distance the oxygen atom deviates \nfrom a centrosymmetric position, and is shown in the \ninset in Fig.  2b. For a cubic perovskite structure D is 0, \nwhile for bulk LFO D is 0.39 Å.\nAtomic column shape\nHaving fitted every atomic column with an elliptical 2-D \nGaussian (Eq.  1) where the rotation of the major axis \nfrom the vertical is one of the fit parameters (i.e., the \ndirection of the \nσx,y can change), one can extract infor -\nmation about the shape of the atomic column. This shape \ncan reveal information about the structure parallel to the \nelectron beam [19], and, in some materials, the position \nof light elements using the shape of the heavier atomic \ncolumns [13]. With the six parameters defined in Eq.  1, \none can use the \nσx and σy to calculate the ellipticity for \nthe atomic column which is a measure of how elongated \nthe atomic column is. We define the ellipticity (\nǫ) as \nfollows:\ngiving an ǫ which is always greater or equal to 1. An ǫ of 1 \nwould be a perfectly circular atomic column, while ǫ = 2 \nis an atomic column where one side is twice as long as the \nother side.\nSimilarly, one can use θ to find the direction of the \nellipticity. We define this direction as ρ,\nwhich means that ρ will be the angle between the posi -\ntive x-axis and the longest σ. In addition, ρ will always \nbe between 0 and π due to the symmetry of the 2-D \nGaussian.\nThe software implementation\nThis program is implemented in the Python (3.x) program-\nming language, and both the source code and instructions \n(2)ǫ =\n{ σx\nσy , if σx >σ y\nσy\nσx , if σy >σ x\n(3)ρ =\n{\nθ, if σx >σ y\nθ + π\n2 , if σy >σ x\non how to install it is available at http://atomap.org .  \nIt relies heavily on the fitting and modelling routines \nimplemented in HyperSpy [39]. Currently, the program \nis optimized for analysing STEM-images of perovskite \noxide materials projected along a \n⟨110⟩ direction. How -\never, it is trivial to adapt it for any structure as discussed \nbelow in \"Adapting for other structures and projections \". \nExtending the code should be easy, and requests for both \nnew features and assistance in adapting for other struc\n-\ntures are welcome on the issue tracker (linked from \nhttp://atomap.org/) or by e-mail to the corresponding \nauthor. The software and source code are distributed \nunder the free and open source GNU General Public \nLicense v3.0.\nThe program is sorted into several classes: atom_posi\n-\ntion, atom_plane, sublattice, and atom_lattice. atom_\nposition is the position of a single atomic column, and \ncontains variables like position, \nσ, θ, and other informa -\ntion about the shape of the atomic column. atom_plane \ncontains all the atom_positions which belong to the \nsame atomic plane. sublattice contains all the atom_\npositions and atom_planes belonging to the same \nsublattice, like the A-cations in Fig.  1. atom_lattice con\n-\ntains all the sublattices, so in Fig.  1, this would include \nthe A-cations, B-cations, and oxygen sublattices. The \natom_lattice class can be saved and loaded, saving all the \natom_position parameters.\nOne current limitation is that the whole image given \nto the program must have a similar crystal structure. For \nexample, a perovskite heterostructure shown in Figs. 4, 5, \nand 6 works fine, due to the structures being sufficiently \nsimilar. A perovskite oxide film grown on Si would, how\n-\never, not work. Similarly, if there are any amorphous \nparts in the image, local bright features could be identi\n-\nfied as atomic positions by the peak finding function. One \nsimple solution is to crop the images, so only the same \ncrystal structure is within the image given to the pro\n-\ngram. This could probably be automated, which would \nallow for automatic determination of regions with differ\n-\nent structures. For example, in an aluminum alloy, one \nwould be able to automatically figure out which regions \nare aluminum matrix and which are precipitates.\nWhen fitting a single sublattice, the fitting is done on \nindividual atomic column using a single 2D Gaussian. \nOne obvious improvement would be to make a model \ncontaining all the atomic columns, and fitting them all \nsimultaneously. While this is more computationally \ndemanding, it could reduce the effects from neighbor\n-\ning atomic columns and, therefore, increase the accu -\nracy of the fitting. The amount of improvement would be \nrelated to the degree of overlap between the atomic col\n-\numns. With a very large separation between the atomic \ncolumns, this improvement would be zero or very small. \nPage 7 of 12\nNord et al. Adv Struct Chem Imag  (2017) 3:9 \nWith a very small separation, this improvement would \nbe substantial. Quantifying the limits of fitting a single \natomic column vs. including the neighboring atomic col\n-\numns is interesting, but outside the scope of this work \nas the separation between the atomic columns was suf\n-\nficiently large.\nAtomap implements a version of this by removing the \nmost intense sublattice before fitting the less intense sub-\nlattices. This is equivalent to having a model where the \nmost intense atomic columns are fitted first, then locked, \nand afterwards fitting the second most intense atomic \ncolumns. Fitting 2D Gaussians to all atomic columns in \na data set simultaneously will be experimented with in \nAtomap in the near future, using the aforementioned \nprocess to find reasonable initial values first.\nAdapting for other structures and projections\nThe first step in using the program is finding a value for \nthe smallest atomic separation for the first sublattice. \nIt is important to find a good value for this variable, as \nhaving either too many or too few atoms in the first sub\n-\nlattice will lead to the wrong repeating unit being iden -\ntified. This then results in incorrect identification of the \nsublattice. In the example, discussed in \"Initial posi\n-\ntions and refinements \", this value is half the separation \nbetween the A-cations in the [1 10]-direction. The pro -\njected (110) spacing is 2.76 Å for STO. However, half the \nvalue (1.38 Å) did not work very well, which is caused by \nthe scanning distortions and sample drift during image \nacquisition. By trial and error, a value slightly less than \nhalf the smallest separation was found to work reliably. \nFor the STO in Fig.  1: approximately 1.3 Å. This value is \nused for the atom column separation in the peak finding \nfunction. For only fitting a single sublattice, this will be \nenough for the program to work.\nFinding a second sublattice requires some a priori \nknowledge. For a perovskite oxide in the [1\n10]-projection \n(Fig. 1), one would specify that the atoms in the second \nsublattice are found between the atom columns in the \n(110)-atomic planes for the first sublattice.\nThese procedures are documented on the webpage \n(http://atomap.org/).\nResults and discussion\nTo test the processing method, data sets from epitaxial \nperovskite oxide heterostructures are used. First, the \neffects of imaging conditions and image registration on the \nresults are tested. Then, a comparison is made between the \nmethod outlined in this article and GPA. Finally, the fitting \nof non-circular elliptical columns is tested.\nAll directions and atom planes are given in the pseudo\n-\ncubic coordinate system.\nUncertainty and reducing scanning distortions\nIt is clear that the reliability and the uncertainty of the \npeak fitting technique will be connected to how clearly \nthe different atomic columns can be resolved. An impor\n-\ntant aspect of this is scanning distortions, as the elec -\ntron probe is susceptible to both mechanical, electrical, \nand magnetic disturbances, both from noise within the \nmicroscope system, as well as extraneous disturbances \nfrom the surrounding environment, and these will have \nsome influence, even in the best designed microscope \nrooms [40]. One way to reduce the effects of these dis\n-\ntortions is to acquire several fast images of the same \narea, register them, and sum them afterwards [40]. In \nearlier studies, this was simply performed by rigid regis\n-\ntration of the images, which takes out the effect of any \ndrift, and simply averages out any local distortions (at \nthe cost of a slight deterioration of the resolution) [3]. \nA better approach is to perform rigid registration to \nremove the effects of drift, followed by non-rigid regis\n-\ntration to remove the effects of short period instabilities \nin the scanning system [41, 42]. To investigate the effect \nof short acquisition and alignment, as opposed to record\n-\ning a single scan at a longer dwell time, we analysed two \ndifferent STEM-ADF images from the same session taken \nalong the [1\n10] cubic direction of a sample of STO: (i) \nacquired as a single image using a pixel dwell time of \n38.5 \nµs (line synced) with the image shown in Fig.  3a. \n(ii) Acquired as an image stack of 20 images with dwell \ntime of 2 \nµs per pixel (i.e., almost the same total acquisi -\ntion time per pixel) which is then processed using Smart \nAlign [42]. This aligned stack is shown in Fig.  3b. Clearly, \nthe aligned stack appears a little sharper and less noisy \nthan the single long acquisition image, but to quantify the \neffects of this difference on atom spacing measurements, \nthe images were quantified as set out above in \"Finding \ndistances between atomic columns \", and some compara\n-\ntive results are shown in Fig.  3c–h. A distribution of dis -\ntances between the atoms parallel to the [111] (vertical in \nimage) and [\n112] (horizontal in image) crystallographic \ndirections of STO is shown in Fig.  3c, d: these directions \nare parallel to the slow and fast scan directions, respec -\ntively. As these data are from a region of a pure STO \nsample far away from any interfaces, there should be no \nvariations in the distance between the planes. There\n-\nfore, these plots should be essentially a measure of the \nuncertainty in the measurements, which we define as one \nstandard deviation in the spread of the distances. The dif\n-\nference between the single scanned image and the Smart \nAlign image is very obvious, especially for the slow scan \ndirection. In this case, the uncertainty is reduced from \n≈\n16 p.m. to 7 p.m. For the fast scan direction, the reduc -\ntion in uncertainty is much less: from 7.5 to 5.9 p.m.\nPage 8 of 12Nord et al. Adv Struct Chem Imag  (2017) 3:9 \nSimilar measurements for distances between the atomic \nplanes in the slow and fast scan directions are shown in \nFig. 3e and f, respectively. Compared to c and d, this is in \neffect averaging over many atomic columns. The uncer -\ntainty in the slow scan direction for the single scanned \nimage is clearly much larger, and comparing the normal \nand Smart Align data sets, there is a massive reduction in \nthe uncertainty from about 7 p.m. to 1 p.m. For the fast \nscan direction, the uncertainty in the single scan image is \nless, as might be expected, although there is a big negative \nspike at one point, which is typical for the kind of local \ndisturbance that often arises in atomic resolution images. \nIn this case, the uncertainty is reduced from about 5 p.m. \nto 1 p.m. Thus, it should be possible using non-rigid reg\n-\nistration to make measurements of A-site (or other heavy, \nbright atom) plane spacings with about 1 p.m. precision.\nOne interesting effect is the decrease of uncertainty \nbetween the individual atomic columns and atomic \nplanes for the single scanned image and the Smart Align \nimage. For the fast scan atomic column uncertainty there \nis a small improvement for the aligned stack (7.5 to 5.9 \np.m.), while for the atomic plane uncertainty there is a \nmuch larger improvement (5 to 1 p.m.). This is most likely \ndue to the scanning distortions being correlated when \nacquiring a single scanned image using line synchroniza\n-\ntion. When acquiring an image stack with a short pixel \ndwell time of 2 \nµs, these scanning distortions are much \nless correlated. Since finding the distances between the \natom planes consists of averaging the positions of many \natomic columns, these uncorrelated local distortions in \nthe image stack are averaged out.\nFinally, the interplanar spacings for the different sublat\n-\ntices are shown in Fig.  3g, h. Here, a similar STO Smart \nAlign ADF data set has been used to estimate the A- and \nB-cation uncertainty levels, and an ABF data set has \nbeen used to estimate the oxygen uncertainty levels. The \naverage distances between the interplanar spacings are \ncalculated for the A-cations, B-cations, and oxygen. For \nall atom types in both fast and slow scan directions, the \nuncertainty is about 1.0–1.4 p.m.\nIn view of the fact that the non-rigid registration \nmethod gives clearly superior results, all data sets in the \nfollowing sections are acquired as image stacks and pro\n-\ncessed using Smart Align, and then processed using the \nmethod outlined in \"Initial positions and refinements\".\nStrain analysis: comparison to GPA\nAs stated in the introduction, GPA is a commonly used \ntechnique for characterizing distances between atomic \ncolumns in atomic resolution (S)TEM images [21]. Fig\n-\nure 4 shows a comparison between GPA and the method \nexplained in this work, for an epitaxial LSMO/STO-(111) \nheterostructure. Figure  4a shows a STEM-ADF image \nand FFTs from the LSMO (top inset) and STO (bottom \ninset). The fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the LSMO \nregion has extra \n{\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n}\n spots (circled in red) which are \nFig. 3 Quantifying the uncertainty in measurements of atomic spacings as a consequence of image acquisition methodology: a conventional \nHAADF-STEM image acquisition and b image constructed from a rapidly acquired image stack by rigid and non-rigid registration.

Adv Struct Chem Imag  (2017) 3:9 \nnot present in the STO region. These superstructure \nspots indicate doubling of the unit cell along the [111]- \nand [11\n1]-directions in the LSMO. GPA is performed \nusing the {111} and {11 2} FFT spots utilizing the STO \nsubstrate far away from the interface as a reference. \nThese data are then summed in the [111]-direction, giv\n-\ning the average out-of-plane distance as a function of \ndistance from the LSMO/STO interface (Fig.  4b, green \ndashed line). Using the method explained in \"Finding \ndistances between atomic columns\", the average distance \nbetween the A-cation monolayers in the [111]-direction \nis calculated as a function of the distance from the inter\n-\nface (Fig.  4b, blue line). Comparing the two line profiles, \nthey both show the same general trends: larger lattice size \nin the STO, and smaller in the LSMO, with a slight lat\n-\ntice size increase at about 8 nm into the film. However, \nthe unit cell doubling observed in the FFT is only visible \nin the real space method. This is due to the choice of the \nmask in the GPA, since the one used to get the data in \nFig. 4 did not include the superstructure spots. It could be \npossible to use the \n{\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n}\n spots to do the GPA, instead of \nthe {111} and {11 2}. This could show the presence of the \nunit cell doubling, but the regions where these peaks are \nnot present would not yield any information, for exam\n-\nple, the STO substrate and the regions in the LSMO film \nwithout the unit cell doubling.\nMapping oxygen octahedral tilting\nFigure 5a shows an ABF image of the LSMO/LFO/STO-\n(111) heterostructure, where there is a “zig-zag” pattern \nof the oxygen columns along the [110]-direction in the \nFig. 4 Comparison of geometrical phase analysis (GPA) and the \nmethod outlined in this work for determining the out-of-plane \nlattice parameter. a STEM-HAADF image of an LSMO film grown on \nSTO-(111).

Adv Struct Chem Imag  (2017) 3:9 \nLFO layer. This displacement from the centrosymmetric \nposition can be quantified using the method discussed in \n\"Finding distances between atomic columns \". An exam\n-\nple of this is shown in Fig.  5b, where the [001]-direction \ndisplacement is calculated for all the oxygen columns. The \ndisplacement in the LFO layer takes the form of an alter\n-\nnating long and short displacement in the [001]-direc -\ntion. To give a better visualization, the displacement is \nset to zero at the A-cation positions, leading to the check\n-\nerboard pattern shown in Fig.  5b. An average of the dis -\nplacements as a function of distance from the LFO/STO \ninterface is shown in Fig.  5c. This shows both a clear \nsuperstructure and the variation in the displacement \nacross the film. This can then be used to infer parameters, \nsuch as the octahedral tilting pattern and bond angles.\nOne important caveat with using ABF imaging is the \nrelationship between real and measured atom column \npositions is not always intuitive [43]. For example, if the \nsample is slightly tilted off the zone axis, the atomic posi\n-\ntions can shift. This effect varies with respect to thick -\nness, atomic number, collection angle, and convergence \nangle [43]. Thus, to properly analyse the atomic positions, \nimage simulations coupled with careful considerations \nof the experimental parameters are required. However, \nthe measured atomic positions are still useful as the first \napproximations, even if further work with image simula\n-\ntions is required to ensure that the conclusions are robust.\nEllipticity\nAs discussed in \" Atomic column shape \", one can \nalso use the shape of the atomic columns to extract \nstructural information [12]. An example of this is \nseen in Fig.  6a, which shows A-cation ellipticity in the \nLSMO/LFO/STO-(111) heterostructure imaged using \nSTEM-ADF. In the LFO layer, there is a clear elonga\n-\ntion of the A-cation sites, annotated with the blue \nellipses. By fitting elliptical 2-D Gaussians (Eq.  1) to \nevery A-cation, this elongation can be quantified with \nǫ (Eq.  2) and ρ (Eq.  3). Where ǫ is  σLongest\nσShortest\n, and ρ is the \nangle between the positive x -axis and σLongest. Having \nthese values for every A-cation, one can visualize these \nin a vector plot (Fig.  6b). Here, the length of the arrows \nis given by \nǫ, and the direction by ρ. There is a clear dif -\nference in the LFO layer, which has an elongation close \nto the [111]-direction. This is even more apparent with \nthe vector plot in Fig.  6c and the \nǫ plot in Fig.  6d, which \ntakes the average of the data as a function of distance \nfrom the interface. The ellipticity is constant in the \nSTO substrate until the LSMO/STO interface, where it \nincreases to its maximum about 2 nm into the film, and \ndecays gradually in the LSMO film to the same level as \nin the STO substrate.\nAs discussed in \" Atomic column shape \", there are \nmany variables which can affect ellipticity of the atomic \ncolumns. Therefore, for the vector plots in Fig.  6b, c, a \nsystematic average \nǫ and ρ “background” have been sub -\ntracted. This noise level was determined from the STO \nsubstrate (\n≈0.12 ǫ in the [111]-direction), where the ellip-\nticity should be 1. This systematic background is most \nlikely due to a variety of factors: sample drift, astigma\n-\ntism, misalignment, having the sample slight off-axis, \nand residual scanning distortions. Especially, the latter \nFig. 6 Mapping ellipticity (ǫ) and rotation (ρ) of A-cation atomic columns in the LSMO/LFO/STO-(111) heterostructure. a STEM-ADF image of the \nheterostructure.

Adv Struct Chem Imag  (2017) 3:9 \nis present in this data set, as horizontal “streaks” visible \nin some of the atomic columns (Fig.  6a). These are still \npresent, even though the image was made by averaging \nan image stack. This is due to the fast scan being in the \nsame direction for all the images in the image stack. One \nsolution is rotating the fast scan direction by 90° in every \nsecond image in the image stack, which will average out \nthis scanning distortion. Another effect can be the 2-D \nGaussian fitting itself, where overlap from the neighbor\n-\ning atomic columns can influence the fitting. For exam -\nple, in Fig. 6, the B-cations might add a slight component \ntowards the [001]-direction.\nConclusion\nIn summary, we have developed a free and open source \nsoftware package for automatically quantifying the posi\n-\ntions and shapes of atomic columns in atomic resolution \nSTEM-images. By utilizing a model-based approach with \n2-D Gaussians, the most intense atomic columns are sub\n-\ntracted, and all the sublattices in a STEM image can be \nanalysed separately. Furthermore, the projected average \n2-D atomic arrangement is automatically extracted by \nfinding the atomic planes with the largest spacings. This \nis used to organize the atomic columns in atomic planes, \nwhich facilitates the analysis of interplanar distances. \nUsing images where the scanning distortions had been \nreduced using non-rigid registration, a precision of 6p.m. \ncould be obtained for distances between single atomic \ncolumns, and 1.2 p.m. for distances between atomic \nplanes.\nThe software has been tested on HAADF and ABF \nSTEM images of perovskite oxide heterostructures. The \ndisplacement of oxygen columns in ABF images was \nquantified. Using elliptical 2-D Gaussians, the projected \nshape of the A-cation atomic columns was extracted. \nThe software should be easily adaptable for any atomic \nresolution STEM image, as long as the atoms are clearly \nresolved.\nAbbreviations\nSTEM: scanning transmission electron microscopy; ADF: annular dark field; \nHAADF: high angle annular dark field; ABF: annular bright field; GPA: geo-\nmetrical phase analysis; FFT: fast Fourier transform; PCA: principal component \nanalysis; STO: SrTiO\n3; LSMO: La0.7Sr0.3MnO3; LFO: LaFeO3.\nAuthors’ contributions\nMN conceived the idea, designed the methodology, wrote the software, and \nacquired the experimental data.
