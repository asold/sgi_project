  "abstract": "The aging of power transformers causes several defects and damages in the insulating system, especially in the insulating paper. The degradation of the insulating paper generates dissolved gases in the insulating oil, which are measured by gas chromatography and used as an indicator of the insulation status. The state of the insulating paper can be identified based on the degree of polymerization (DP) measurement. In some cases, when the measurement of DP is difficult, estimating DP can be accomplished through gathering information about some of the testing parameters, such as the dissolved gases (DGA), breakdown voltage (BDV), oil interfacial tension (IF), oil acidity (ACI), moisture content (MC), oil color (OC), dielectric loss (Tan δ), and furans concentration specifically (2-furfuraldhyde (FA)). The statistical tools (correlation and multiple linear regression), based on 131 transformer samples, can be used to build a relation linking DP and one or more of the previous parameters to identify the insulating paper status and the percentage of remaining life of the transformer. The results indicated that it is difficult to build a mathematical model to relate between the DP and the testing variables, except with FA, where the trend of DP with FA is more obvious than with other variables. The empirical formula to compute DP based on the FA concentration was developed and gave promising results to compute DP and the remaining life of the power transformers.",
