    "abstract": "Active noise control (ANC) technology can be able to reduce the low frequency noise effectively, and has been widely applied in limited enclosed equipment, such as cars, aircraft cockpits, and headphones, etc. Compared with the traditional noise reduction methods, ANC technology is a cost-effective method in handling the low-frequency noise of transformers. An experimental ANC system in a virtual substation is designed and constructed. An adaptive signal tracking ANC algorithm is proposed, and a set of ANC experimental prototypes applied to a virtual substation is designed. Based on the proposed algorithm, the distributions of the acoustics and spectral characteristics of transformer noise in substations are analyzed. Experimental results show that the effective noise reduction can be achieved an average of 5 dB(A) in a given region with respect to the absence of the ANC system.",
