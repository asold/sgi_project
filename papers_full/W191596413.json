  "abstract": "The changes in structural arrangement in transformer oil based magnetic uids upon the eect of an external magnetic eld and temperature were studied by acoustic spectroscopy.The attenuation of acoustic waves was measured as a function of an external magnetic eld in the range of 0300 mT, parallel to the direction of the eld and as a function of temperature in the range of 1535 • C for various magnetic nanoparticles concentrations.The strong inuence of the steeped magnetic eld on the acoustic wave attenuation was detected and its hysteresis was observed, too.When a magnetic eld is swept at a constant rate, the dominant interactions between the external magnetic eld and the magnetic moment of the nanoparticles occur, leading to the aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles and clusters formation.However, the temperature of magnetic uids has very important inuence on the obtained dependences, where the mechanism of thermal motion acts against the cluster creation.The observed inuences of magnetic eld and temperature on the investigated magnetic liquids structure are discussed.",
