This pilot study aims to investigate the impact of ChatGPT on users’ experiences by \nadministering two distinct questionnaires, one generated by humans and the other by ChatGPT, along \nwith an Emotion Detecting Model. A total of 14 participants (7 female and 7 male) aged between 18 \nand 35 years were recruited, resulting in the collection of 8672 ChatGPT‑associated data points and \n8797 human‑associated data points. Data analysis was conducted using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). \nThe results indicate that the utilization of ChatGPT enhances participants’ happiness levels and \nreduces their sadness levels. While no significant gender influences were observed, variations were \nfound about specific emotions. It is important to note that the limited sample size, narrow age range, \nand potential cultural impacts restrict the generalizability of the findings to a broader population. \nFuture research directions should explore the impact of incorporating additional language models \nor chatbots on user emotions, particularly among specific age groups such as older individuals and \nteenagers. As one of the pioneering works evaluating the human perception of ChatGPT text and \ncommunication, it is noteworthy that ChatGPT received positive evaluations and demonstrated \neffectiveness in generating extensive questionnaires.\nRecent years have witnessed the prevalence of the application of chatbots and natural language processing (NLP) \ntechnology in various fields. To be specific, NLP refers to the ability of the computer to understand and generate \nhuman-like texts 1. The latest deep learning tool ChatGPT released by OpenAI in 2021 2 is now regarded as an \nartificial intelligence-powered (AI-powered) tool that could conduct human work 3. As a language model, Gen-\nerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is an example of NPL development 4. As a variant of GPT-3, ChatGPT is \ndesigned to generate human-like text naturally and to finalise general-purpose conversations 5. Human–com-\nputer interaction contributes to improving the user experience of the GPT model by designing interfaces that \nare both intuitive and user-friendly, facilitating easier interaction with GPT models and comprehension of their \nresponses for users 6. At the same time, GPT offers researchers a novel approach to investigate users’ responses \nto computers and machines.\nDue to its exceptional language-generating ability, ChatGPT has been extensively studied by researchers \nacross various fields, including but not limited to education 7, healthcare 8, cybersecurity 9, and AI develop-\nment 10. There is ongoing research into the impact of ChatGPT on users’ emotions, some studies suggest that \nemotional development in chatbots aims at providing more engaging and supportive interactions between users \nand machines. Meng and Dai compared emotional support from chatbot and human partners and stated that \nthe AI chatbots increasingly engaged in emotional conversations with humans 11. Uludağ stated that although \nChatGPT does not have emotions, it can recognize the users’ emotions and respond appropriately in human-like \nlanguage 12. Besides, based on emotional contagion theory, Xu and other experts also believe that with the proper \nOPEN\n1School of Computer, Data and Mathematical Science, Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia. 2College of \nInformation Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.  *email: fady.alnajjar@\nuaeu.ac.ae\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:2781  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53255-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nexpectations and control levels over the emotions of the users, AI-powered chatbots could provide a positive \ninfluence on users’ emotions 13.\nThe primary motivation driving this research stems from the growing prevalence and significance of AI-\npowered chatbots, particularly represented by ChatGPT, in a wide array of applications. As the deployment of \nthese AI-powered language models becomes increasingly pervasive, it is crucial to comprehensively understand \ntheir impact on human–computer interaction experiences 14. In this context, our study seeks to investigate the \nspecific implications of integrating ChatGPT into an academic research questionnaire, with a particular emphasis \non revealing users’ emotions and their interactions with AI-powered language model texts and communication.\nOur investigation was motivated by existing literature, such as the work of Fischer, Kret, and Broekens, which \nsuggests that females tend to react more sensitively than males when detecting emotions 15. Additionally, a \nstudy conducted in 2016 by Deng et al. 16 explored gender differences in emotional expression and revealed that \nwomen often report more intense feelings. Building upon these established findings, our study aims to explore \nthe gender differences in response to AI-generated text and human-generated text. Therefore, in recognition \nof the importance of gender-based considerations in technology adoption and user experiences, our study also \nseeks to explore whether there exists gender-based differences in users’ responses to the introduction of Chat -\nGPT. Through a scientific analysis of users’ interactions and emotion-detecting result, we hope to uncover any \ndifferent patterns that might be obvious in how male and female users perceive and engage with the chatbot \nwithin the academic research questionnaire environment. Ultimately, we aim to advance our understanding of \nthe complex interaction between artificial intelligence and human, thereby fostering the development of more \nuser-friendly and empathetic AI-powered solutions.\nIn the designed study, ChatGPT is used to generate a copy of the questionnaire contents. ChatGPT was \nselected as a tool of generating content is because it is a language model trained on a massive amount of data, \nwhich allows ChatGPT to generate grammatically correct and human-like text 5. Additionally, ChatGPT can \ngenerate text on a wide range of topics, making it a multipurpose tool for tasks such as writing, summarizing, \nand responding to user inquiries 17. ChatGPT was utilized to generate the questionnaire for the present study, as \nit is capable of comprehending the conversation’s context and learning from previous interactions.\nThe participants are invited to complete two questionnaires with the same content, and the questionnaires \nare formulated by humans and ChatGPT separately. And their emotional changes are recorded by an Emotion \nDetecting Model. The study finds that ChatGPT plays a favourable role in improving participant’s happiness levels \nand reducing their sadness levels. What’s more, the study illustrates that female users tend to be more responsive \nto the introduction of ChatGPT. These results suggest that ChatGPT has significant potential for application in \nresearch domains and human–computer interaction contexts.\nThe subsequent sections of this paper will be structured as follows: section “ Introduction” will reveal the \nmethodology, including the generation of questionnaires and the development of the experimental setting, the \ndesign and implementation of the emotion-detecting model, the recruitment of the participants, and the methods \nto avoid ethics issues and reduce bias. Section “Methodology” will illustrate the data analysis, including the source \ndata display, visualised graphs and results obtained from the data analysis. Section “ Discussion” will provide a \ndiscussion of the findings, including an analysis of their implications and potential contributions to the existing \nliterature, as well as an evaluation of the limitations of the study.\nMethodology\nResearch design\nThe project is approved by Western Sydney University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC Approval \nNumber: H15278). All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. \nInformed consent was obtained all from all subjects and/or their legal guardian(s) to participate in publishing \nthe information and images in an online open-access publication.\nThe questionnaires are an effective method for investigating the emotional perception of ChatGPT as they \nprovide a means to directly compare the emotional responses of participants during interactions with a human \nand with an AI-powered chatbot. By administering different questionnaires, one designed by a human and the \nother by human-ChatGPT, researchers can examine differences in emotional perception. Furthermore, while \nparticipants are working on the questionnaires online, their positions are relatively stable, therefore, their facial \nexpressions can be captured by an internally installed emotion detection model. This allows for an objective \nmeasure of emotional response to be collected alongside the subjective measures provided by the questionnaires. \nThe use of an emotion detection model provides researchers with additional insights into the emotional experi-\nences of participants, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the emotional impact of ChatGPT.\nIn order to evaluate the influence of ChatGPT on users’ emotions, we designed two versions of the online \nquestionnaire on Qualtrics. Questionnaire version 1 (V1) is formulated by “Humans” only, and questionnaire \nversion 2 (V2) is formulated by “Humans and ChatGPT” , i.e., ChatGPT rephrased the survey questions created \nby humans and produced a human-ChatGPT version. The type of all questions is Single Choice, and the choices \nare completely the same (Table 1). However, the questions of the two questionnaires are created by human and \nChatGPT separately. But the question contents share the same meaning. To be specific, after creating all questions \nin V1, we inserted requests in ChatGPT one by one:\nResearcher: Please modify this question in an academic research questionnaire, the question is “ …… ” .\nChatGPT provides a list of revised questions.\nThe selection criteria are the sequence. We select the first revised one on the list. But if the first question is \ntoo long and the content length is over 30 words, we then switched to the second one.\n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:2781  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53255-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nEmotion detecting model\nThe development of the adopted emotion-detecting model is implemented using the Python programming lan-\nguage. We have selected the YOLOv5 model as our chosen approach for emotion detection. YOLO (Y ou Only \nLook Once) models are renowned for their real-time object detection capabilities, offering a balance between \nspeed and accuracy 18. YOLOv5 utilized the PyTorch deep learning framework 19,20. The model was trained \nusing an open dataset called the AffectNet dataset 21. AffectNet stands as an expansive dataset, encompassing \napproximately 400,000 images, neatly divided into eight distinct emotion categories: neutral, angry, sad, fearful, \nhappy, surprise, disgust, and contempt. We conducted data augmentation specifically on a subset of the publicly \naccessible AffectNet dataset. The YOLOv5 model, a well-established and meticulously scrutinized framework \nin the domain, was employed for our endeavours. The model’s prototype precisely curated 10,459 images for \ntraining purposes. The obtained results indeed exhibited promising. From these eight categories, five prevalent \nemotions, namely sad, angry, happy, neutral, and surprise, were selected for the training of the model employed \nin this study, as depicted in Fig. 1. The final model process entailed the use of 15,000 images. Detailed insights \nregarding the model’s accuracy can be found in 22. However, to summarize, the mean Average Precision (mAP) \nat a threshold of 0.5 for the emotions of angry, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise is recorded as 0.905, 0.942, 0.743, \n0.849, and 0.948, respectively. In the model, we designed 5 emotion classes: Angry, Happy, Neutral, Sad and Sur-\nprise. As indicated in Fig. 1, the model can detect and evaluate the major emotion of the current facial expression.\nEvery time the participant’s facial emotion change, a new record will be automatically created. Figure  2 is a \npiece of source data we get from the model. The model can calculate the percentage of each emotion and select \nthe one that has the largest percentage. The time record of each emotion helps to match the questionnaire sec -\ntions they are doing.\nTable 1.

The participants were required to finalise the online questionnaire in a classroom.\nThe participants will not be informed they are under emotion-detecting, which is to make sure they can act \nas naturally as possible. But when they finish the testing, the researcher will explain the test process and show \nthem the emotion-detecting model. If the participants do not agree to use their data in the following experi-\nments, we will remove all the related documents and data immediately. For those who give consent, their details \nare unidentifiable. Only the emotional data will be saved.\nIt is worth noting that according to a recent survey conducted by Statista 23, which indicated that the major \nage group of ChatGPT users falls within the 25–34 age range. Furthermore, a survey conducted by the Pew \nResearch Center, as reported by Vogels 24, found that adults under 30 are more likely to be familiar with Chatbots \nand actively use ChatGPT in their daily lives. Considering these findings, we made a conscious decision to invite \nparticipants within this age group to participate in the pilot study. By focusing on the age group most representa-\ntive of ChatGPT users, we aimed to ensure that the study’s outcomes closely align with the user demographics \nand usage patterns.\nBias reducing method\nTo mitigate potential bias, we integrated the two versions of the questionnaire into a single instrument. To be \nspecific, the testing questionnaire consists of different sections (as shown in Fig.  3): the ChatGPT section and \nFigure 2.  Sample of source data.\nFigure 3.  Display of questionnaire design.\n5\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:2781  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53255-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nthe Human section. Each section is set a timer of 30 s. The participants cannot move to the next section until the \ntime runs out. Therefore, the reading speed will not influence the testing progress speed. The blending of queries \nformulated by both ChatGPT and humans may result in participants exhibiting more authentic behaviour, as \nthe queries become indistinguishable.\nMeanwhile, a temporal tracking mechanism was integrated into the emotion detection model. It facilitates \nthe association of emotional data with corresponding questionnaire segments.\nWhen designing the questionnaire, we adopted neutral questions (Table 1). The decision to employ neutral \nand biography questions was driven by our objective to establish a standardized set of inquiries that could be \ncompared objectively between the two distinct groups, devoid of any inherent biases or preconceived notions. \nMultimedia documents, encompassing text, images, sounds, or videos, tend to evoke diverse emotional responses \nin individuals exposed to them 25,26. Designing questions that evoke strong emotional responses would present \nchallenges in distinguishing whether the observed emotional shifts were attributed to the question’s nature, the \ngeneration method (via ChatGPT or human intervention), or other influencing factors. By integrating neutral \nquestions, our aim was to mitigate potential biases that might be introduced by human surveyors. Additionally, \nwithin the “Extended research” section of our manuscript, we undertook supplementary efforts to investigate \nthe utilization of both ChatGPT and human-generated questions across different age demographics. The incor-\nporation of neutral questions allows for an assessment of ChatGPT’s proficiency in generating questions across \ndiverse contexts, maintaining a careful balance to avoid undue emotional influences.\nData collection\nThe dataset comprises 8672 instances of emotion data associated with ChatGPT and 8797 instances associated \nwith human responses, collected from a total of 14 participants. On average, each participant contributed data \npoints within the range of approximately 1000 to 1800 points. Generally, the prevailing emotion observed in both \nV1 (ChatGPT version) and V2 (Human version) questionnaires is “Neutral” as shown in Table 2. The frequency \nof emotion in the female group (Table 3) and the male group (Table 4) has a slight difference.\nBased on the graphical representation of the average values and standard deviations of each emotion \n(Fig. 4a–e), the small standard deviations suggest that the data is more tightly clustered around the mean.\nDiscussion\nThe data from this pilot study suggest some potential relationships between participants’ emotions toward the \nHuman-made questionnaire and the ChatGPT-made questionnaire.\nWhile the dominant emotion illustrated from the data is “neutral” (with a mean value of approximately 0.6), \nsome variations in the expression of other emotions were detected. As depicted in Fig.  5, the mean emotion \nvalues indicate that the participants experienced a higher level of happiness (ChatGPT Happy value: 0.068) when \nresponding to the questionnaire formulated by ChatGPT compared with the questionnaire designed by humans \n(Human Happy value: 0.047). Meanwhile, they also experienced a lower level of sadness (ChatGPT Sad value: \n0.155) when facing questionnaire V1, compared with questionnaire V2 (Human Sad value: 0.172).\nThe emotional expressions of participants throughout the questionnaire completion process can be detected \nfrom the below graphs. A comparative analysis of the emotional dynamics captured in the graphs corresponding \nto the human-formulated questionnaire (Fig. 6a) and the ChatGPT-formulated questionnaire (Fig. 6b) indicates \nsome differences. To be specific,\nTable 2.  Average emotion frequency (general).\nClass Angry Happy Neutral Sad Surprise\nChatGPT 0.087 0.068 0.664 0.155 0.026\nHuman 0.095 0.047 0.654 0.172 0.032\nTable 3.

The graphical representation of the data indicates that significant gender differences are not \nobserved. However, when examining specific emotions, such as Happiness, it is noteworthy that female partici-\npants exhibit greater sensitivity in their responses to different versions of the questionnaires.\nSpecifically, female participants demonstrated higher levels of happiness than their male counterparts, with a \nChatGPT Happy value of 0.085 and a Human Happy value of 0.043 (Fig. 7a, b).

In contrast, the difference in \nmean values for male participants was small, with a difference of only − 0.006 between the ChatGPT-formulated \nquestionnaire and the Human-formulated questionnaire. In terms of the Angry emotion, the observed difference \nof female mean value between responding the ChatGPT-formulated questionnaire and the Human-formulated \nquestionnaire is estimated to be − 0.011 (Mean value of ChatGPT minus the mean value of Human), while for \nmales the difference number is − 0.004.\nWe performed a repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOV A) to compare measurements within partici-\npants for two types of questionnaires: Human-generated Questionnaire and ChatGPT-generated Questionnaire. \nWe analysed the average emotion readings per participant across both questionnaire types, considering gender \nas a covariate. The results, presented in Table 5, revealed significant findings for some emotions such as surprise, \nanger, and sadness. Interestingly, the ANOV A results indicated no significant difference in user reactions between \nthe Human-generated questionnaire and the ChatGPT-generated questionnaire.\nBased on a systematic literature review by Forni-Santos and Osório, it has been observed that women gen -\nerally outperform men in recognizing a broad set of basic facial expressions 27. However, our ANOV A results, \ndepicted in bar charts (Fig. 8a–e), indicate no significant gender effect, as evidenced by p-values exceeding 0.05. \nFigure 5.  Average values of emotions.\nFigure 6.

Interestingly, our study reveals that male participants tend to exhibit greater expressiveness, particularly \nin relation to specific emotions such as sadness, anger, and surprise.\nUpon careful analysis of the data, it is evident that the emotional perception of human and ChatGPT-gener-\nated questionnaires does not exhibit a significant difference. However, we have observed certain subtle trends that \nappear to favour ChatGPT’s performance. Additionally, we have taken note of the fact that the ChatGPT ques-\ntionnaire received positive evaluations and was not negatively perceived in comparison to the human-generated \nquestionnaire. These findings provide valuable insights that support the potential applications of generative AI \nin content generation and questionnaire design.\nXu et al. 13 found AI chatbots positively influence emotions in business and retail, using a video-based experi-\nment and subjective user questionnaires. In contrast, our study focuses on academia, using ChatGPT and a more \nobjective emotional detection model to evaluate participants’ emotions and feedback while completing various \nagent-generated questionnaires.\nExtended research\nTo obtain a more comprehensive knowledge of the impact of AI-powered language models on individuals’ emo-\ntional and behavioural responses while completing questionnaires, we utilized the third version of the question-\nnaire (V3). To be specific, the study utilized three distinct versions of a questionnaire: Version 1 (V1) was a purely \nhuman-created version in which all the questions were generated solely by human researchers. Version 2 (V2) \nwas a hybrid human-AI version, in which the ChatGPT model was employed to revise or rephrase the questions \nfrom V1, resulting in a modified version of the questionnaire. Finally, Version 3 (V3) was a pure AI-generated \none, in which the researchers provided ChatGPT with specific criteria, including the desired functions and target \nparticipants, as well as necessary information, and allowed the model to automatically generate the questionnaire.\nDemonstrated in Fig.  9 are the comprehensive specifications and corresponding outputs resulting from \nthe request to generate a questionnaire using ChatGPT (the full version of the questionnaire provided in the \nappendix). The image demonstrates that ChatGPT is equipped to produce complex questionnaires, including \nmultiple-choice options. The generated questionnaire was subsequently transferred to Qualtrics to create an \nonline version for participants to complete.\nThe experiment was conducted using a methodology in which questions from all three questionnaire versions \nwere combined into a single questionnaire sheet, with participants remaining unaware of the specific source of \nthe questions they were responding to.\nThe findings of the extended experiment, as presented in Table 6, provide several noteworthy observations. \nSpecifically, in terms of the emotions of happiness, and sadness, the average values obtained for Version 3 exhibit \nslight differences from those obtained for Versions 1 and 2. Nevertheless, it should be highlighted that the emo-\ntion of neutrality exhibits an approximate 0.4 decrease in Version 3 relative to its values in the other two versions. \nFigure 7.

Both of the average values of “ Angry” and “Surprise” in \nVersion 3 are higher than those in Version 1 and 2.\nThe results observed may potentially result in the fact that in the absence of intervention by human research-\ners, some survey questions generated purely by the AI language model could be regarded as offensive to some \nextent. As presented in Table 7, notable differences between Versions 3 and Versions 1 and 2 were observed in \nseveral questions, particularly those concerning participants’ private experiences, for instance, memory levels. \nVersions 1 and 2, guided by human intervention, avoided directly asking about participants’ memory status, \npreferring to conclude their memory levels through questions about their ability to recall past events. However, \nVersion 3 generated questions that more directly probed into participants’ private details. Such questions may \nhave contributed to the higher emotion values obtained for “ Angry” and “Surprise” in Version 3.\nFigure 8.  (a) Gender distribution-happy. (b) Gender distribution-sad.

The results of \nthe study indicate that the involvement of ChatGPT in the questionnaire design is associated with an increase \nin users’ reported happiness levels, at the same time, the sadness level is also seen a decrease as evidenced by \nthe data. Another notable finding of this study is that in terms of emotion Happiness, the female participants \nappeared to be more responsive to the introduction of ChatGPT, as indicated by a greater increase in their \nreported levels of happiness compared to male participants.\nNotably, ChatGPT generated the questionnaire sorely without human intervention and did not draw the \nanticipated positive responses from the participants. Surprisingly, there was a slight increase in the expression of \n“ Angry” and “Surprise” emotions. This outcome may have been rooted in certain questions in the AI-generated \nquestionnaire, which could have been perceived as potentially offensive.\nIt is significant to highlight that the implementation of a research questionnaire that is created by humans \nwith the assistance of AI-powered language models represents a superior approach for enhancing user satisfac-\ntion and fostering a sense of happiness. Furthermore, it was discovered that ChatGPT can offer a diverse range \nof responses when requests are proposed with more details. As illustrated in Table  8, it provides an example of \nthe various responses produced by ChatGPT in different scenarios. The main task of ChatGPT is to generate \nappropriate responses to inquiries concerning the age groups of the participants. To complete this, three different \nscenarios have been established, including “young kids, ” “university students, ” and “older people. ” While some of \nthe responses provided by ChatGPT are universal and thus overlap across scenarios, specific recommendations \npersonalised to each age group are also provided. Regarding the “young kids” group, the responses provided by \nChatGPT are intentionally designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, as children may encounter \ndifficulties in understanding complicated information. In the case of “university students, ” the responses are \nformulated to be precise and clear, ensuring that adults can grasp the concept directly. When communicating \nwith the “older people” group, ChatGPT is capable of generating responses that show a higher level of respect \nand sensitivity, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.\nLimitations\nAlthough this study has generated significant findings and made notable contributions, it is crucial to acknowl-\nedge and address certain limitations for future research endeavours. First and foremost, the sample size employed \nin this study was relatively small, consisting of only 14 participants. We acknowledge the significance of adopting \na larger sample size in order to obtain more reliable results and conclusions. However, we hope that as a pilot \nstudy, our present research findings, derived from a sample size of 14 participants, may make an elementary \ncontribution to the field of measuring users’ emotional responses to ChatGPT. Also, it is worth mentioning that \nthere is a number of 8 k–10 k data points were generated per participant. The primary objective of this paper \nis to conduct an introductory investigation into this topic. Future work aims to resolve this, and this has been \nindicated.\nMoreover, the age range of the participants was restricted to individuals between 18 and 35 years old, poten-\ntially limiting the generalizability of the findings to a broader age demographic. Additionally, it is essential to \nrecognize that the experiment was conducted exclusively in the United Arab Emirates, and as such, the results \nmay be subject to cultural influences that are specific to this region. To enhance the robustness and applicability \nof future studies, it is recommended to incorporate larger and more diverse participant samples across multiple \ncultural contexts.\nA potential research direction for future work may involve exploring the potential effects on user emotions \nby incorporating supplementary language models or chatbots, with a particular focus on other specific age \ndemographics such as teenagers and older individuals.\nTable 8.

As one of the first works to \nevaluate human perception of ChatGPT text and communication, our study contributes to the literature develop-\nment on human perception of AI-powered language model texts and communication. The findings revealed that \nusers reported higher levels of happiness when utilizing the hybrid-formulated questionnaire, which combines \nchatbot-formulated questions with human intervention, compared to both the solely human-formulated and \npure-AI-formulated questionnaires. Gender differences were not prominent, although male users demonstrated \nslightly higher responsiveness and expressiveness towards the chatbot compared to female users. Furthermore, \nChatGPT displayed the ability to adapt responses according to different scenarios to enhance the user experi -\nence. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the study’s restricted sample size, limited age range and cultural \nimpacts impose limitations on the generalizability of the results. Overall, this pilot study provides a foundation \nfor future research exploring the effectiveness of ChatGPT and other chatbots in improving user experiences. It \nis encouraging to observe that ChatGPT was not negatively evaluated and can be effectively utilized in generat-\ning lengthy questionnaires.\nData availability\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, Fady Alnajjar, \nupon reasonable request.
