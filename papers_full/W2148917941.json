The author would like to thank Dr. Noriko Hara for all of her assistance and guidance with \nthis paper. © Terra B. Jacobson\nAs Facebook has come to dominate the social networking site arena, \nmore libraries have created their own library pages on Facebook to cre-\nate library awareness and to function as a marketing tool. This paper \nexamines reported versus actual use of Facebook in libraries to identify\ndiscrepancies between intended goals and actual use. The results of a \n2009 study about the use of Facebook in libraries are used as a guide to \ngauge the perceived and actual uses for Facebook in this study. Results \nof the test reveal that the two ranks are not statistically different, but that \nthere is a noticeable difference when looking at the perceived and actual \nrankings qualitatively.\nn the past few years, libraries \nhave begun to examine the \npossibilities available to them \nthrough social networking \nsites like Twitter and Facebook as a tool \nfor library awareness and marketing. As \nFacebook has come to dominate the so -\ncial networking site arena, more libraries \nhave created their own library pages on \nFacebook to create library awareness and \nto function as a marketing tool. This has \nspurred a large number of how-to articles \nabout the uses for Facebook in libraries as \nwell as research about how librarians and \nlibraries use Facebook. This paper exam-\nines reported versus actual use of Face -\nbook in libraries to identify discrepancies \nbetween intended goals and actual use. \nThe results of the 2009 study by Hendrix, \nChiarella, Hasman, Murphy and Zafron, \nabout the use of Facebook in libraries, is \nused as a guide to gauge the perceived \nand actual uses for Facebook in this study .\n1\nLiterature Review\nAlthough Facebook’s existence is hardly \nnew, its use in the library setting is just \ntaking hold. Library literature relating \nspecifically to Facebook has a very lim-\nited range at this time and is not widely \npublished or is found in smaller or digital-\nonly journals. A review of the existing lit-\nerature shows that most research relating \nto Facebook in the library setting fits into \none of five categories, with some of these \ncategories consisting of only one paper. \nThis review examines each of these five \ncategories to determine what is missing \nin library literature on Facebook and to \nexplain what this study has to contribute \nto library literature.\nCurrently, the most popular type of \nliterature is “How-To” based. Included \nin this category are also articles relating \nto best practices as well as ideas for the \nuse of Facebook. This area includes a \nstudy by Charnigo and Barnett-Ellis, in \ncrl-88r1\n80  College & Research Libraries  January 2011\nwhich they survey academic librarians to \nunderstand their knowledge of Facebook \nuse on campus as well as the potential it \nhas to be used as an academic resource. \nTheir study found that librarians were \nwary about the actual academic purpose \nof Facebook with “54 percent of those \nsurveyed” stating that it did not serve an \nacademic purpose.\n2 The lack of academic \npurpose found in Facebook may be what \nled to the many how-to and library pro-\nmotion articles that followed this 2007 \nstudy. This includes a wide range of \npurposes for Facebook, from Cooper’s \narticle addressing how to create custom or \nuse-existing library-related applications \nto articles stating the marketing benefits \nof Facebook for libraries.\n3\nWith an onslaught of Facebook sug -\ngestions, the analysis of library-centered \ncase studies soon followed suit in dis -\ncussing individual library experiences \nusing Facebook in a variety of outreach \nand marketing levels. Glazer describes \nthe attempt to use Facebook to market \nthe Rutgers library, sending out mass \nmessages through Facebook as well as \nusing it to create closer ties with other \ncampus organizations.\n4 Yet this study \ndoes not provide any measurable results, \njust a qualitative discussion about their \npersonal experience. This type of article \nis reflected in much of the case studies \nfound in the literature; similar discus -\nsions occur in both Adamich’s study, “The \n‘Facebook’ Effect on FDLP Communica -\ntion,” and in Powers, Schmidt and Hill’s \n“Why Can’t we be Friends? The MSU \nLibraries Find Friends on Facebook.”\n5 \nBoth of these studies look at how their \nlibrary has used Facebook, but none can \nreally evaluate its effectiveness; a crux in \nthe study of Facebook as it is very difficult \nto measure. \nThe previous studies, as well as others, \nhave often included an element of the sur-\nvey method. The next category of litera-\nture falls under the area of student-based \nresearch. Two articles that conducted \nstudies relevant to the use of Facebook \nin libraries both examine the effectiveness \nof Facebook as an outreach tool through \nstudent perspectives. Mathews’ article de-\nscribes the author’s experience in contact-\ning students via Facebook and the results \nof his “friend requests.” The author found \nthat it helped in “promoting the library” \nand prompted some questions about \nlibrary resources.\n6 The author suggests \nFacebook as an outreach tool to connect \nwith students and encourages “colleagues \nto do the same.”\n7 Another student-based \nstudy, by Chu and Meulemans, investi-\ngates the willingness of students to com-\nmunicate with professors via Facebook \nand offers “practical integration” ideas \nfor library use of Facebook.\n8 They suggest \nthe use of Facebook for “content delivery, \nreference assistance, outreach, and infor-\nmation literacy instruction” and suggest \nthat students may be willing to commu -\nnicate with organizations via Facebook, \nalthough their research showed that \nstudents were reluctant to communicate \nwith faculty this way.\n9\nAnother type of study concerning the \nuse of Facebook in libraries is the service-\nprovided analysis. This looks at a particu-\nlar service that the library is attempting \nto provide. The study by Mack, Behler, \nRoberts, and Rimland follows the imple-\nmentation and promotion of reference \nservices via Facebook. The study found \nthat from September through the end of \nthe semester in December, 126 reference \nquestions were received via Facebook \nout of the 441 total reference questions \ntracked. This was the highest of all areas, \nprompting the authors to recommend \nthat libraries create a Facebook page to \nconnect with their patrons.\n10 \nThe final subset of literature is the \nperceived-use study. This is currently a \nsmall subset of literature containing an \narticle by Hendrix, Chiarella, Hasman, \nMurphy, and Zafron. This study uses the \nsurvey method to question librarians in \nthe health sciences about their libraries’ \nuse of Facebook. This survey provided \na listing of what librarians believe their \nlibrary uses Facebook for. The results \nprovided illustrated that most librarians \nFacebook as a Library Tool: Perceived vs. Actual Use  81\nsay they use their Facebook page to “push \nout announcements,” “post photos,” and \n“to be where users are.” 11 The authors \nconcluded that it was not possible to \ndetermine “whether or not Facebook is a \nuseful and effective application.” 12 This \nis one of the very few studies to address \nwhat Facebook is used for in the library \nsetting and provides useful guidelines for \nperceived use for the analysis presented \nin this paper. \nThis current study attempts to add to \nthe literature on library Facebook use, as \nthere is a lack of research studies in this \narea. What none of the previous literature \naddresses are actual library Facebook \npages and their content. This study \ncompares the perceived use of library \nFacebook pages as viewed by librarians \nwith actual library Facebook pages. This \nexamination will shed light on what \nlibraries are actually using Facebook for \nand help in establishing a set of actual \nuses for libraries. The study will add to \nthe literature and future research by \nproviding librarians with a list of actual \nuses they can implement and also provide \nresearchers with an outline of services \nthat can potentially be evaluated for ef-\nfectiveness in further research. \nMethodology\nThis study used the results from the \nHendrix et al. study to set a framework \nfor the comparison of actual library Face-\nbook pages, groups, and profiles to what \nlibrarians are stating they are used for \n(in other words, perceived use).\n13 The top \nresponses from their survey will be used \nto compare with actual use. \nThe current analysis uses two data col-\nlection steps to obtain the broadest range \nof data. The investigation began with \na selection process, determining which \nlibrary Facebook pages would be used \nin the evaluation. Since many libraries do \nnot update their pages regularly, shown \nby the Hendrix et al. study with some \nlibraries only performing “0 to 20 minutes \nof maintenance a week,” library Facebook \npages, for this study, had to be carefully \nselected to gain insight on Facebook page \nperformance.\n14 To avoid performing an \nanalysis on Facebook pages that were \nnot updated at all in the past month, a \nlistserv of college librarians were asked \nfor their input on frequently updated \n(at least once a week) library pages. The \nFacebook Web site was also searched \nfor frequently updated library pages to \ninclude in the study. This frequency of \nupdates is important since, if the pages \nare not active, there would have been \nnothing to observe. The selection process \nresulted in 12 library Facebook pages for \nanalysis. To be sure to provide an even \nanalysis of libraries, 2 libraries from 6 \ncategories of libraries were selected to be \nobserved. These categories were as fol -\nlows: Small Colleges/Universities (under \n3,000 students); Midsize Colleges/Univer-\nsities (3,000–10,000 students); Large Col-\nleges/Universities (10,000 students and \nabove); Branch Libraries (part of a larger \nuniversity system); Community Colleges \n(offering up to associates degrees); Special \nLibraries (subject-specific collections).\nData collection for this study was per-\nformed on the same day for all individual \nlibrary Facebook pages (April 14, 2009). \nA form was created to collect data from \nthe pages as objectively as possible (see \nAppendix 1). Each library was assigned \na random number from 1 through 12 to \ndistance the results from other known \ninformation about each institution. The \nareas selected for data collection on the \nSite Observation Form are all possible in-\ndicators for the uses indicated in the Hen-\ndrix et al. study as well as other relevant \ndata that would be useful for possible \ncorrelations.\n15 Information collected in the \nSite Observation Form (see Appendix 1) \nincluded the date of Facebook page cre-\nation for each page, the number of fans, \nthe number of tracked page changes and \nthe number of days the page was in exis-\ntence. The form also collected information \nabout the use of specific applications such \nas photos, events, and reference help. It \nalso collected information on the total \nnumber of wall posts and the number of \n82  College & Research Libraries  January 2011\nposts from fans as well as other optional \napplications that were added to the Face-\nbook pages. \nThe data collected from this form was \nentered into two tables for data analysis. \nThe first table (see table 1) contains data \nrelating to the maintenance and use of \nthe Facebook page. This includes infor -\nmation about how many fans, wall mes-\nsages, fan messages, photos, events, and \nboxes applications could be found on the \npage. It also contains information about \nhow many days each library Facebook \npage has existed and the average days \nbetween update (calculated by the days \nin existence divided by the total updates). \nThe second data set (see table 2) is a col-\nlection of yes/no data where 1=yes and \n0=no. These data calculate how many \nadd-on applications are used on each of \nthe library Facebook pages and how many \ntimes each application is used between \nthe 12 library pages.\nAdditionally, to prepare for the analy-\nsis, the survey results from Hendrix et \nal. were categorized into 6 tiers, rank -\ning from highest to lowest number of \nresponses. The items with the highest \nnumber of responses were ranked as tier \n1, the second highest as tier 2, and so on \nthrough 5 tiers of “use.” Any data from \nthe survey that did not generate any re-\nsponse was stated to have “no use.”\n16 This \nranking system is also used in the analysis \nto compare the perceived use from the \nHendrix study to the data retrieved from \nthis study. These uses were developed by \nHendrix in their 2009 study as possible \nuses for Facebook. The types of use and \ntheir rank from the Hendrix data are as \nfollows:\nTier 1: Announcements/Marketing, \nPhotos, To be where users are\nTier 2: Reference services\nTier 3: Forum for Users\nTier 4: RSVP to events, OPAC search, \nDatabase Search\nTier 5: Employee Announcements, \nEmployee Communication\nNo Use: Administer a course, Tutorials, \nPost Audio, Post Video, Podcasts\n17 \nResults\nData collected from the Site Observation \nForm was input into their corresponding \nExcel spreadsheets totaling the number \nof fans, wall messages, fan messages, \nphotos, events, “boxes” applications, \n“add-ons,” updates, and days in existence \n(quantity of use). Additional data were \nalso gathered about how many library \npages used particular applications such \nas reference services, video, discussion \nboards, and the like (yes/no responses). \n Table 1\nFacebook Page Maintenance and Use \n \n* Data format for this item only 1=yes, 0=no\n Li br ar y Nu mb er Fans Wa ll Messa ge s F an Message s P hoto s I nfo Tab Used * E vent s B oxes Total Update s Day s in  Existe nc e A vg .

Averages \nwere collected for information pertain -\ning to the quantity of use, and ratios for \nupdates were also determined. These \ndata are useful in understanding library \nFacebook usage as a whole, whereas the \nyes/no data for how many libraries use \nparticular applications were very useful \nin determining the tier ranking for specific \napplications. Both were used to determine \nthe actual use to compare to the Hendrix \net al. survey data as a ranking tool, which \nwill be discussed in the analysis section.\n18\nThe data sets will not be discussed at \nlength in this paper, as these data were \nused primarily for the ranking proce -\ndure discussed in both the analysis and \ndiscussion sections of this paper; the \ncollected data are available in table 1 \nand table 2. These data did allow for a \nPearson Correlation to be conducted to \ndetermine if any of the data showed any \ncorrelations, meaning if any one aspect of \nFacebook use was at all related to other \ntypes of use. Pearson Correlations were \nrun using SPSS to determine relation -\nships between how many fans a Face -\nbook page has and how many events, \nadd-on applications, and updates a Face-\nbook page has. It was found that there \nis no relationship between how many \nevents are posted on a Facebook page \nand how many fans a page may have, \nwith a negative correlation of .096. There \nwere moderate relationships found in \nboth the number of add-on applications \nand fans, a positive correlation of .554, \nas well as the relationship concerning \nhow many updates had occurred on the \nFacebook page and the number of fans \nthe page had, a positive correlation of \n.478. This does not mean that these add-\nons or number of updates increases the \nnumber of fans a page may have, but \nthat there is some relationship between \nthese items (although none of them are \nstatistically significant at the 0.05 level). \nAlso, it must be noted that the sample \nsize in this analysis is very small (n=12). \nIt may be possible that frequent updates \nand an increased number of add-on \napplications may help in developing a \nlarger Facebook fan base, and it would be \nworth consideration in library Facebook \npage development.\n Table 2\nNumber of add-On applications on Facebook Pages \n \nNote. 1=yes, 0=no for this data set.\nLi br ar y Nu mb er Ref/Ask Help No te s L in ks IM Vide o F av .

The \ndata were gathered in table 1 and table \n2 and were then used to determine the \nranking of each Facebook “use” that was \npreviously determined by Hendrix et al. \nFor each time a library Facebook page \nhad an application on its page, the task \nwas counted as a “use” of that item. This \ncould result in a total of up to 12 out of \n12 uses for any one application. Each ap-\nplication was associated with a “use” that \nwas defined by Hendrix et al. that was \ndetermined by each use (such as Photos, \nReference Services, and the like) being \nmatched up with plausible Facebook ap-\nplications, options, or sections of the page \nthat would indicate that a particular use \nwas occurring in library Facebook pages. \nFor example, the use “Forum for Users \nto Communicate” would be observed \nthrough the use of the Facebook discus -\nsion tool and by the number of messages \nleft on the wall that were communication \nfrom “fans.” If these were used, then this \nwould confirm the use “Forum for Users \nto Communicate,” and based on how \nmany of the twelve pages confirmed this \nuse, that particular use would be ranked \n(according to the same tiers laid out in \nthe methodology section). The ranking \nrequirements are indicated as follows:\nTier 1: at least 10 libraries perform \nthis use\nTier 2: at least 8 libraries perform this use\nTier 3: at least 6 libraries perform this use\nTier 4: at least 4 libraries perform this use\nTier 5: at least 1 library performs this use\nNo Use: indicated by 0 libraries per -\nforming this use\nThese rankings were created to mirror \nthe information provided by Hendrix et \nal. to best recreate a similar and equally \nplaced difference between the tiers. In \nthis tier system, zero indicates “no use” \nsince any actual use of that particular \n“use” would have been determined by \nthe data collected. \nAnalysis\nTo understand how each use was classi-\nfied into a specific tier for ranking of its \nparticular presence on Facebook pages, \neach “use” ranking will be explained, \noutlining which data supports the place-\nment of that “use.” The use “ Announce-\nments/Marketing” was determined by the \ninformation provided by the Facebook \nWall and the number of fans a page had as \nwell as the events posted. In this case, 11 \nout of 12 libraries (all numbers concerning \nhow many libraries will be out of a total \nof 12 libraries) posted information about \nevents and 8 libraries announced research \nservices and sources. The average update \ntime for library pages was every 6.4 days \nwith an average of 9 events posted per \nlibrary site. These results ranked this use \nin tier 1. The use “Photos” used Flickr \napplications and photos posted in the \nphoto section of the page to determine the \nranking of this use. The average number \nof photos per page was 35.75, and 10 out \nof 12 libraries had photos on the page. \nHowever, 6 of these pages only had pro-\nfile photos posted. Therefore, this is not \nthe primary use of that Facebook site and \nthe use was ranked accordingly, at tier 3. \nThe next use to be examined is “to be \nwhere users are,” which used users’ posts \nand fans to determine its ranking. The \ndata show an average of about 231 fans \nper site with all but three pages having \nover 100 fans, but there are only 3.8 fan \nmessages per library on average. Only \n6 have more than 2 posts individually \nand 4 library pages have 0 posts. This is \nnot what one would consider user par -\nticipation, and therefore this use was also \nranked at tier 3. The next use, “reference \nservices,” is an outreach tool that has been \ndiscussed in past literature, but only 4 \nlibraries provided an option to contact the \nlibrary (determined by reference contact \ninformation or ask a librarian services), \nresulting in a ranking at tier 4. The use \n“forum for users to communicate” was \ndetermined by the discussion options as \nwell as wall posts. Out of 12 libraries, 5 \nhad a discussion section, which shows ef-\nFacebook as a Library Tool: Perceived vs. Actual Use  85\nfort, but most of these discussions had no \npast or current participants. Along with \nthis finding, only 3.8 out of 54.25 average \nwall posts were from fans, which is not a \nhigh percentage of fan input. This study \nis not discussing effectiveness of these \ntools, but the actual use on the library’s \nend, resulting in this use being ranked \nin tier 4. Along the same vein of fan com-\nmunication, the use “RSVP to events” is \nevaluated by the use of the events tab. \nThe data collected showed an average of \n9 events posted per library with 9 out of \nthe total 12 libraries posting events. Since \nit is not possible to see the actual replies \nto events from viewing the profile alone, \nthis was ranked based on the number of \nlibraries posting events, giving it a high \nrank of tier 2. \nThe next items examined were library \nsearch tools. In the first of these uses, \n“OPAC Search,” evaluation was deter -\nmined by library pages that included a \nsearch tool. A total of 10 libraries supplied \nan OPAC or catalog search on their site, \nmaking it highly ranked as tier 1. The \nother search tool, “Database search,” only \nhad 2 out of 12 libraries using this tool, \nwhich was evaluated by the presence of \na database search utility on the pages; \nthis resulted in it being ranked at tier 5. \nOriginally in the Hendrix et al. study, \nthe use “post video” was determined \nto have no use.\n19 This study found that \n“post video” was actually ranked at tier 5, \nwith 2 out of 12 libraries using Facebook \nto post video (determined by the actual \nposting of video on the page). The last \nitems listed with use in the Hendrix et \nal. survey, “employee announcements” \nand “employee communication,” were \ndetermined by listings on the RSS feed \nas well as the events tool.\n20 Both of these \nuses were not mentioned in either the RSS \nfeed or the events section. This resulted \nas these items having no use. A difficulty \nin this determination of use was that this \nresearch does not allow for examination \nof private communication through Face-\nbook; therefore, this finding of no use \ncould be incorrect. \nOther items resulting in no use in \nthe Hendrix et al. study—administer a \ncourse, tutorials, post audio and pod -\ncasts—also were found to have no use \non the library Facebook pages.\n21 These \nwere determined by the posting of course \nmaterials or links, tutorials, and audio \nposts (both general and podcasts). None \nof the pages examined used these tools, \nresulting in no use for these areas. Items \nfound to have “no use” do not necessar -\nily mean that these are not used in other \nlibrary Facebook pages, but this does tell \nus that the use of these tools is very low in \ngeneral, since this sample covered various \nlibrary types. \nDiscussion of Perceived Use and \nActual Use\nTo illustrate the change in rank order for \nthe “uses” evaluated in this study, figure \n1 shows the comparison between the \nHendrix et al. study and the results of \nthis analysis or the “ Actual Facebook Con-\ntents.”\n22 Each item is listed from highest \nto lowest ranking on the predetermined \ntier system (Tier 1–5 and No Use). The \nnumber to the left of each use is its deter-\nmined tier, and items that were not found \non the pages or were listed as having no \nuse were classified in the category “no \nuse.” The results of this analysis show \nthat many of the same “uses” had no use; \nadded to the category of no use is “em-\nployee communication” and “employee \nannouncements,” and the use “video” \nwas moved to a tier 5 category since some \nFacebook pages (2) used video applica-\ntions. Other major differences noticeable \nin figure 1 is the higher ranking of OPAC \nSearches, RSVP to events, and the drop in \nranking from the Hendrix et al. survey of \nthe photo, to be where users are, forum \nfor users, and database search uses. The \nsurveys both seem to be on par with the \nuse, announcements/marketing, perhaps \nconfirming that this may be a good use \nof this tool. \nTo fully examine the change between \nthe perceived and actual use of Facebook \nby librarians, a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank \n86  College & Research Libraries  January 2011\nTest was conducted that assesses the null \nhypothesis for the data sets. Each use was \nranked against itself as shown in figure 1, \nand all items that had a rank of “no use” \nwere ranked as a value of 6 to be able to \nconduct the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test \nwith SPSS version 16. The null hypothesis \nin this test is that the two samples do not \ndiffer. Results of this test accepted the null \nhypothesis. The results of the Wilcoxon \nSigned-Rank Test shown in tables 3 and \n4 illustrate that the p value of .467 is not \nstatistically significant, leaving the results \nto be questionable when relating to the \ndifferences in rank between the perceived \nand actual use. \nWhat these data present is that the \ntwo rankings are not statistically signifi -\ncantly different. Qualitatively, though, \nthe Hendrix et al. survey ranked many \nof these items slightly higher, which \ncould indicate that librarians perceive \ntheir use of Facebook to be much more \nactive than it actually is even though the \nWilcoxon Signed-Rank Test accepts the \nnull hypothesis that their differences are \nnot statistically significant. This could \nbe a result from the homogenous nature \nof the librarians surveyed (all academic \nhealth science librarians) in the Hendrix \net al. study resulting from beliefs de -\nveloped in their particular community \nof practice.\n23 This result could also be \ninfluenced by the attempt to classify \nthese items into a particular ranking \nsystem with the addition of a rank of 6 to \ncalculate the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. \nAlso, many nonparametric tests were \nexamined for use in this study (Mann-\nWhitney test, Spearman Rank Order \nCorrelation Coefficient, and others), but \nnone of them were correct for the type \nFigUre 1\nComparison in raking between Hendrix et al.

There \nmay not be a large difference in rank, \nbut it seems that there is a difference of \none or two tiers in many of the uses for \nFacebook presented here. \nIssues/Recommendations\nThis study is not without issues that \ninfluence the results presented here. \nBecause not many library pages are still \nactive (not updated within the past 6 \nmonths), it was very difficult to select \ncandidates for this study. Also, inactive \npages are not represented in this study, \nwhich would greatly influence the results \nof this evaluation. However, since this \nstudy is looking at use, it was determined \nby the author that pages must be in use to \nevaluate the current uses. Along with this \nissue of use, the study is also based on the \nresearcher’s perception of what Facebook \nprograms and application are predictors \nof particular uses, and the evaluation \nin this study is only performed by one \nresearcher. Perhaps further evaluations \nwould consider conducting multiple \nevaluations of each site by various evalu-\nators. It is also difficult to determine or \npredict use since, although an applica -\ntion may be provided \n(such as a discussion \nboard), that does not \nnecessarily mean that \nit is being used by \n“fans.” This was not \naccounted for in this \nstudy since this ob -\nservation does not \nattempt to predict use \nof the Facebook pages \nby patrons or “fans” \nbut how librarians and libraries use \nFacebook as a library tool. \nAlthough this study confirms many of \nthe same uses as the Hendrix et al. study, \nit does illustrate that there are specific \nways in which libraries and librarians can \nbest use Facebook. The results presented \nhere show that many libraries are using \nFacebook primarily as a marketing tool, \nand it may be valid to assert that this is \ncurrently the best use in the library realm. \nHowever, uses for communication from \npatrons or “fans,” communicating library \nneeds, and as a forum/discussion space \nfor users may not be an ideal use. Most \npages observed in this study did not have \nany “fan” posts or user discussion even \nthough the space was provided for them. \nLibrarians state that many of them are \ndoing more with their Facebook pages \nthan what is actually showing up in their \npage content. Librarians need to be aware \nof how much they are actually doing with \ntheir Facebook pages and look at why \nthey created or want to create a Facebook \npage. This study shows that we, as librar-\nians, may be more ambitious in our hopes \nfor our Facebook presence than we can \nactually materialize. \nTable 3\nWilcoxon Signed-rank Test: ranks\nN Mean \nrank\nSum of \nranks\nPerceived - Actual Negative Ranks 7a 4.93 34.50\nPositive Ranks 3b 6.83 20.50\nTies 5c\nTotal 15\na.

From this study, it also \nwas found that Facebook would be a bet-\nter tool for “active libraries,” or libraries \nthat host a lot of events, exhibits, work-\nshop, and other activities, as its top use is \nfor announcements and marketing. Also, \nlibrarians should not get too attached to \nFacebook, as there is always the next tool \nor social networking site that people are \nusing. Web 2.0 applications move quickly, \nand the Internet is constantly changing; \nlibrarians should be prepared to leave \ntheir hard work behind to jump to the \nnext tool. \nNotes\n 1. D.
