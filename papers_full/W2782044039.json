On the other\nhand polysomnography (PSG) studies and other forms of objective\nassessment are mainly directed at measuring duration and\narchitecture of sleep. While PSG studies of people with PD (PwP)\nare mainly small or lack case controls,\n3 one large case controlled\nstudy5 did conﬁrm that patients had shorter total sleep time, lower\nsleep efﬁciency and increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep\nlatency compared to controls; while nocturnal arousals, obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea, periodic leg movements and objective abnormal\nsleepiness were not more frequent in patients than controls.\n6 Two\nimportant considerations could confound thisﬁnding of reduced\nsleep time and sleep efﬁciency in PD. First, PSG is usually for a\nsingle night and may suffer from the 'ﬁrst night effect' of sleeping\nin the sleep lab, whereas it has been demonstrated that\nsubsequent nights have ~30 mins more sleep duration with half\nof this in REM sleep.\n7–10 Second, age has a clear effect on sleep\npatterns11 with total sleep time reduced by about 10 min with\nevery advancing decade, with a trend toward increasing light\nsleep and less slow wave or REM sleep.\n11 This is relevant because\nPwP are older than the usual subject undergoing a PSG study.\nActigraphy has been validated for estimating parameters of\nnight-time sleep in populations of healthy adults 12,13 but it\nperforms less well in speciﬁc subpopulations such as those with\nPD14 or the elderly.15 Accelerometry can be used to quantify\ndaytime sleep in PD.16 In night time sleep in PD, it performed well\nagainst clinical scales 17,18 at a population level but was less\nsuccessful as a tool for assessing all PSG deﬁned parameters of\nsleep in a single individual with PD.14 This has led to the view that\nspeciﬁc subpopulations may require speciﬁc calibration to assess\nsleep. Most studies using accelerometry to examine nocturnal\nsleep in PD have used standard devices calibrated for assessing\nsleep in the well subject or in the younger person with obstructive\napnea. To our knowledge, none of these systems attempt to\nprovide consideration of the extent to which atonia measured by\nattenuated acceleration signals can be used as a surrogate of\nsleep architecture. The Parkinson’s KinetiGraph is an accelerome-\ntry based system developed for measuring the movements of PD\nand provides a score of immobility consistent with sleep.\nAcceleration levels de ﬁned as 'immobile' in this system have\nbeen validated against ambulatory PSG for day time sleep\n16 and\nagainst clinical scales for nocturnal sleep.18 In this study, we have\ndeveloped and calibrated scores of night time sleep using the PKG\nReceived: 26 July 2017 Revised: 29 November 2017 Accepted: 12 December 2017\n1St Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne, Fitzroy, VIC 3065, Australia;2Global Kinetics Corporation (GKC), Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia;3Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental\nHealth, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia;4Sahlgrenska Academy, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Göteborg, Sweden;5Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine,\nEastern Health, Box Hill, VIC 3128, Australia;6Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia;7Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, VIC 3050,\nAustralia; 8Department of Lung and Sleep, Monash Health, Clayton, VIC 3168, Australia;9School of Clinical Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia and\n10Department of Medicine, St Vincent’s Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia\nCorrespondence: Malcolm Horne (mhorne@unimelb.edu.au)\nwww.nature.com/npjparkd\nPublished in partnership with the Parkinson’s Foundation\n\nsystem in populations undergoing PSG, in subjects with PD and in\na control population aged over 60.\nRESULTS\nPKG sleep scores in Control subjects\nIn most actigraphy systems, periods of low acceleration are\nregarded as 'sleep' . Previously we showed that BKS > 80 in the\nday time, were associated with a high probability of sleep as\nmeasured by ambulatory PSG.\n16 Therefore, in this study, a BKS =\n80 was used as the boundary between putative 'sleep' and\n'wakefulness'. The distribution of BKS > 80 in daytime and night\nperiods were compared (Figs. 1a, b). In the daytime, BKS were\nusually between 80–110, whereas in the night period they were\nclustered in an approximately bell-shaped distribution whose\nmode in normal subjects was usually above BKS = 120. In normal\nsubjects, 75% of night period BKS≥ 111, but BKS≥ 111 were often\nattenuated or absent in PwP (Fig.1b).\nBecause BKS > 111 are typically seen at night, the relationships\nbetween stages of sleep and BK scores were examined in\n10 subjects whose sleep during a PSG was reported as normal.\nThe PSG is scored on electroencephalography activity every 30 s\nas being awake or in a stage of sleep (N1, N2, N3 or REM). The\ncontemporaneous 2 min BKS therefore overlapped four 30 s sleep\nscores. To compare the BKS with the Sleep Score, the four sleep\nstages and wakefulness were given an ordinal value (awake = 0\nand REM = 4) and the median value of the four sleep stages that\noverlapped a single BKS was calculated (Table1 and Fig. 1c).\nThis showed that BKS < 80 were mostly associated with being\nAwake or in N1 (~60% of the time). Nevertheless ~25% of the\ntime, BKS in this range was associated with N2 stage and with REM\nsleep in ~15%. Indeed, similar statements could be made for BKS\n< 111. The pattern was clearly different for BKS > 110, when 78%\nof BKS were associated with one of N2, N3 or REM sleep states.\nFurthermore, 90% of N3 stage and 60% of REM sleep occurred\nwhen BKS > 110. Nevertheless, people were awake ~16% of the\ntime when the BKS > 110 (39% of all wakefulness occurred when\nBKS > 110). The overarching conclusions are that when a subject\nhas:\na. a BKS < 80, there is an approximately 60% chance that they\nare awake or in N1 stage sleep. Thus, BKS < 80 is a fair\nestimate of wakefulness.\nb. a BKS > 110, there is an approximately 80% chance of them\nbeing in N2, N3 or REM sleep. Thus, SQ (the percent of the NP\nwith BKS > 110) is an excellent estimate of the quality of sleep\nand has some relevance to sleep architecture.\nc. lost the peak of BKS > 110 (see below) then they will have lost\n90% of slow wave sleep and 60% of REM sleep.\nThe ﬁve parameters (PTI, PTS, SQ, PTA and MFL) described in the\nMethods were plotted (Fig. 2) (Table 2). Each parameter has a\nbinomial distribution with a clear central tendency as demon-\nstrated by the small interquartile range around the median, which\nalso approaches the mode (by inspection). Each distribution tends\nto have a longer 'tail' of ~10–15% of cases trailing into lower\npercentiles and in considering these it is relevant to recall that\nsome of these controls subjects may have sleep disorders.\nInspection of these plots (and Table2) indicates that in control\nsubjects, median time awake (PTA) was 31%, median sleep\nefﬁciency (PTS) was 69%, median sleep quality (SQ) was 77% and\nmedian fragment length (MFL) was 38 min (IQR:26 –59). As\nexpected PTS was correlated with PTI ( r\n2 = 0.82), but PTI was\nslightly larger than PTS (median 3.2%, IQR: 1.4–5.8% of NP).\nPKG sleep scores and PSG\nForty-six subjects without PD who were investigated with a sleep\nstudy (mostly for suspected sleep apnoea) wore a PKG for the\nevening of the PSG. They were grouped according to the PSG\nﬁndings as:\nNormal (n = 10): no abnormality was described in the report and\nsleep parameters were normal. Median age was 29 y.\n20\n40\n0\n60\n80\n100\nCounts\na\nb\n80 100 140 120 160\n80 100 140 120 160\n20\n40\n0\n60\n80\n100\nCounts\nBKS Units : 23:00-06:00\nBKS Units : 23:00-06:00\nc\nW\nN1\nN2\nN3\nREM\nSleep Stage\n<40 40-80 >11080-110\nBKS\nFig. 1 Immobility during sleep in a normal and a PD subject and a\ncomparison with sleep stages. Figures 1a, b are frequency\nhistograms of BKS (>80) obtained from 6 days of recording. TheX\naxis is the value of the BKS unit and theY axis the number of BKS\nunits with that value.

The\nblack bars show the frequency of BKS of different values from the\nnight period (23:00–06:00) and the red bars are the BKS from the day\nperiod in the same individual. It shows a marked peak in BKS at\napproximately 120 in the night period which is not present in the\nday period. b A histogram from a PWP . The BKS> 80 are from the\nnight period (23:00–06:00). Note that inactive BKS are reduced but\nthe most obvious feature is the loss of the peak of BKS with scores\n>110. c This represents the ﬁndings of 10 individuals whose PSG\nwas reported as normal. Each 2 min required for a BKS score is\nassociated with four PSG scores of sleep state. The PSG sleep scores\nwere given an ordinal value (awake = 0 and REM = 4) and the\nmedian 'PSG value' of the four associated with each BKS was\nestimated. For each individual, the median PSG value for all BKS in\neach of the four BKS categories was calculated (each dot represents\nan individual). The heavy horizontal red lines indicate the median of\nall 'PSG values' (i.e., each score from each individual pooled) of each\nBKS state (the lighter lines are the interquartile ranges). Thus, the\nmedian PSG value for BKS < 40 was 'awake'; for BKS 40–80 was\nbetween awake and N1; for BKS 80–110 was between N1 and N2;\nand for BKS> 110 was N2\nSleep in Parkinson’s disease\nS McGregor et al.\n2\nnpj Parkinson’s Disease (2018)  1 Published in partnership with the Parkinson’s Foundation\n1234567890():,;\nNormal minus (n = 8): these were described as 'normal sleep\nstudy' but mention was made of some aspect such as increased\nleg movements, oxygen saturation changes or sleep fragmenta-\ntion. Median age was 42 y.\nAbnormal (n = 28): these were all cases reported as abnormal\neven though description ranged from 'mild' abnormality to\n'severe'. Median age was 46 y.\nThe same PKG 'sleep' parameters described in Table 2 were\nplotted in Fig. 1. The PTA was less, and the other percentages\nhigher for 'Normal' and 'Normal minus' PSG subjects than for the\nControl subjects (Fig. 1). Although the scores of the 'abnormal'\nsubjects were worse than the other two categories of PSG subjects\n(dark green circles in Fig.1), the scores from the normal PSG were\nbetter than the older control subjects discussed above. Even the\nabnormal PSG cases tended to be similar to scores of the older\nControls, with the exception of the amount of time sleeping,\nwhich was reduced in the normal Controls. This may have been\ndue to the way that sleep efﬁciency was estimated or simply the\npoor sleep efﬁciency of the older person.\nNone of the ﬁve PKG parameters individually provided clear\nseparation between normal and abnormal sleep studies. To permit\nscores to be added, they were normalised according to their\npercentile ranking (0–10th percentile, '0'; 10–20th percentile, '1';\netc. to 90 –100th percentile, '9'). Various permutations and\ncombinations of adding theseﬁve parameters were produced to\nﬁnd the combination that best predicted the PSG diagnosis. The\ncombination that provided the best prediction (Combined Sleep\nScore— CSS) was the sum of the PTI, PTS and SQ. This was plotted\nfor each subject according to the clinical diagnosis (Fig.3) and a\nscore of CSS = 23.5 provided a separation between normal sleep\nsubjects and those with an abnormal PSG report with a sensitivity\nand speciﬁcity of 86 and 80%, respectively.\nPKG sleep scores in PD\nFigure 2 shows that the distribution, median and interquartile\nrange of theﬁve main parameters (PTI, PTS, SQ, PTA and MFL) for\nPwP were signi ﬁcantly different from controls (Table 2). The\ngreatest difference between Control subjects and PwP was in\nSleep Quality (expressed as both percentages and rank percen-\ntiles). This is in keeping with the observation that the peak of\nBKS ≥ 111 in the night period was often attenuated or absent in\nPwP (Fig. 1b).\nThe PDSS 2 in Control subjects and PwP were plotted (Fig.4a).\nThe upper limit for clinically relevant PD-speciﬁc sleep disturbance\nfor the PDSS has been variously quoted as PDSS 2 = 18\n19 and\ngreater than PDSS 2 = 15.20 According to the PDSS 2, 13, or 7% of\ncontrol subjects have clinically relevant sleep disorders (cut-off 15\nor 18, respectively), whereas 60 or 52% of PwP have clinically\nrelevant sleep disorders (cut-off 15 or 18, respectively).\nThe three parameters used for the CSS that best predicted PSG\ndiagnosis was produced for each PwP and control subject (data\nnot shown). CSS for PwP were signiﬁcantly different from the CSS\nof controls (Kruskal Wallis/Dunn’s Multiple Comparisons testp <\n0.0001). The CSS for controls and PwP was then compared with\ntheir PDSS 2 scores. There was a technical problem with this\ncomparison: most of the CSS is distributed over the normal range\n(~90%) whereas only about 30% of PwP had CSS > 25th percentile\nof controls (in keeping with the prediction of the PDSS 2 that only\n30% of PwP have normal sleep). In comparisons, most of the PDSS\n2 ranges across abnormal scores with 75% of control subjects\nTable 1.

This means that the relation-\nship between CSS and PDSS 2 cannot be linear. Nevertheless, the\nrelationship between PDSS 2 and CSS, showed a signi ﬁcant\ncorrelation (p = 0.0002 Fishers exact test).\nFigure 4b shows that most control subjects with a PDSS 2 < 15\nhad high CSS, whereas those with a PDSS 2 > 18 also had lower\nCSS. When the PKG’s sub-scores (Fig.1) were examined for those\nPwP whose PDDS 2 was <15, it becomes apparent that their PTA is\nmuch similar to controls and much less than other PwP. However,\nPTI and PTS are similar to other PwP suggesting that the reason for\ntheir low CSS is fragmentation and early loss of the high BKS that\nare found with higher stages of sleep. This suggests that even\nthough the duration of sleep may be normal, the quality is\nimpaired. This seems to be the case very early in disease (Fig.4c).\nThis was further examined by comparing the PKG sleep sub-\nscores (Fig. 1) with each of PDSS 2 questions (Table 3). Scores\nrelevant to night time movement (Q1 –6 and Q8 –12) were\nexamined using the Mutual Information Test, which is an effective\nmeasure for quantifying any relationship (linear or nonlinear)\nbetween two random variables.\n21 The greatest information about\nthe PDSS 2 came from SQ and PTA, especially for Q1–4 and Q8.\nQ1–3 relate to a person’s assessment of their sleep quality, Q4\nrelates to restless legs and Q8 relates to nocturia. It is also relevant\nthat using the mutual information test, it was apparent that each\nof the PKG sub-scores could be predicted with a high degree of\naccuracy if one of the other scores were known, suggesting that\nthey may not be independent variables. Taken together this\nsuggests that the PKG’s measure of sleep relates to a subject’s self-\nassessment of the quality, wakefulness and restlessness.\nFinally, it is interesting to compare CSS from the single PSG\nnight with the people aged over 60 without PD and PwP. The\nscores from subjects undergoing a PSG study were substantially\nhigher than those from the older cohort at home. Indeed, the cut-\noff for a normal PSG study would have excluded about 80% of the\ncontrol subjects aged over 60.\nSleep scores and duration of disease\nDuration of disease at the time of study was known in 44 PwP. The\nPDSS 2 scores and the CSS were plotted against the duration of\ndisease (Fig.4c). Although there was wide variation, there is a very\nclear trend for both sleep scores to deteriorate as disease\nprogresses. Even by 3 years of disease, 50% of subjects had\nabnormal PKG sleep scores and many subjects had abnormal\nPDSS 2 scores early in disease.\nDay time sleep\nPreviously we showed that the proportion of time with BKS > 80\n(PTI) in the day time (between 09:00–18:00) is a measure of day\ntime sleep. Subjects were grouped according to whether their PTI\nwas <5% (median), 5–10% (median to ninetieth percentile) or\n>20% (associated with low cognition— data not shown) and their\nCSS and PDSS 2 were plotted (Fig. 4d). More severe daytime\nsleepiness was associated with worse night time scores, in\nparticular PTI, PTS and SQ.\nThe PKG measures bradykinesia and dyskinesia over the 6 days\nof recording. Sleep as measured by PDSS 2 or the PKG was not\nrelated to the severity of bradykinesia as measured by the PKG.\nWhile the number of cases with dyskinesia was small, there was no\nsigniﬁcant relationship between the presence of dyskinesia and\neither sleep measure.\nDISCUSSION\nThe ﬁndings of this study suggest that the PKG’s measures of\nsleep provide a fairly accurate guide to the duration, quality,\nwakefulness and fragmentation of sleep. Possibly only the Sleep\nQuality relates directly to reduction in higher sleep stages,\nwhereas the other scores together indicate whether sleep is\n'normal' or 'not normal' without indicating speciﬁcally what aspect\nof sleep is changed. Support for this conclusion include: (i) the link\nwith BKS > 110 and high sleep stages, (ii) changes in PKG sleeps\nscores linked to Q1–4 of the PDSS 2, (iii) change in scores with\nprogression of disease and prediction of day time sleep and (iv)\nthe relationship with the PDSS 2.\nActigraphy has previously been reported to provide a reason-\nable measure of sleep.\n13 Typically accelerometry uses a threshold,\nas was the case in detecting daytime somnolence in a previous\nstudy.\n16 However, it is uncommon to examine the distribution of\nactivity to obtain some measure of sleep level, as we have\nperformed here. Empirically, low levels of acceleration over a 2\nmin period are likely to represent low muscle activity or tone. As\nthe N2, N3 and REM sleep stages are associated with relative\nmuscle atonia, it would be plausible that the proportion of time\nspent being very immobile (i.e., SQ) would relate to higher stages\nof sleep. The association between BKS > 110 and higher sleep\nstages (Fig. 3a) supports this conclusion and future studies\ncombining PSG and PKG studies may show further information\nabout predictions with quality of sleep architecture. It is likely that\nthis would be improved with correlations of heart rate.\n22\nSleep efﬁciency— the proportion of time in which sleep was\nattempted that was actually spent in sleep— is also an important\nmeasure. In the sleep laboratory setting, 'lights off' and 'lights on'\nare in the hands of the lab technicians whereas accelerometry has\nno reliable mechanisms to address this. Although accelerometry\ncan determine when someone is lying recumbent, this does not\nnecessarily mean the person is attempting sleep (an associated\nlight sensor would help clarify this situation). Most people were\nasleep within 30 min of the start of the assessment period used by\nthe PKG (see Supplementary Figure 1). However, even 30 min\nbeyond this 7-h period would have a signiﬁcant effect on all the\nNormal Normal\nminus\nMild-\nSevere\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nCombined Sleep Score\nFig. 3 The PKG’s sleep score compared with polysomnography\nreports. This shows the CSS (Y axis) of subjects who underwent a\nPSG. Subjects are grouped according to whether the sleep study\nwas reported as: 'Normal' (green circles), 'Normal but with caveats'\n(orange circles) or 'abnormal' (black circles). The red dots refer to\nsubjects in whom the sleep abnormality was reported as 'mild'. The\ndotted line is where a Receiver–Operator curve provided the best\nselectivity (86%) and speciﬁcity (80%)\nSleep in Parkinson’s disease\nS McGregor et al.\n4\nnpj Parkinson’s Disease (2018)  1 Published in partnership with the Parkinson’s Foundation\nsleep scores. This may account for some of the differences\nbetween sleep measures obtained by PSG and those obtained by\nPKG and it will be difﬁcult to resolve without some direct measure\nof ambient light.\nMarkers such as PTI have previously been shown to be a\nmeasure of sleep efﬁciency.\n14 However, microarousals can occur\nduring sleep and may be falsely recognised by accelerometry as a\nperiod of wakefulness, thus leading to underestimation of sleep\nefﬁciency. To address this, PTS (percent of time sleeping) was\nproposed. In subjects for whom movements in sleep were\nrelatively infrequent, PTI and PTS would be similar whereas for\nthose with microarousals during their sleep, PTI would substan-\ntially be less than PTS. This proved to be the case, and was\nespecially apparent in subjects with sleep disturbance (measured\nby PDSS 2). Indeed, PwP (and controls) with an abnormal PDSS\n2 score had twice the proportion of PTS in the lowest decile than\nthose whose PDSS 2 were normal.\nPSG is widely accepted as a 'gold standard' but many people do\nnot sleep well on theﬁrst night in a laboratory\n23 even when PSG is\nperformed at home.8,9 Nevertheless, it is surprising that the PKG’s\nCombined Sleep Score that best separated normal sleep from\nabnormal sleep was so high (23.5): it was ~85th percentile of the\nCSS of the control subjects aged over 80. These observations\nshould be considered in the light of data of PSG in normal\nsubjects\n11 and in people with PD.5 These studies show that total\nsleep time is reduced and there is a shift in sleep stages toward\nlighter sleep with age.11 This is apparent even in subjects without\nsubjective sleep complaints and does have variation with gender.\nThe ﬁndings were similar in PD subjects,\n5 whose sleep time was\nshorter and sleep efﬁciency was reduced. However, there was an\neven greater shift toward lower sleep stages in the PD group than\nin case matched controls even though arousals or primary sleep\nwere not increased. Taken together this suggests to us that\naccelerometry is useful in detecting changes that relate to\nduration and to lower sleep stages, but is less useful in detecting\nthe changes that are related to sleep related breathing disorders.\nWhile the fairly high concordance between the PKG scores and\nthe PSG diagnostics provides broad validation, it does indicate\nthat more studies of age matched controls are required and that\naccelerometry may not be useful in detecting sleep related\nbreathing disorders or periodic limb movements without asso-\nciated cardiac measures.\n22\nThe PDSS 2 is a comprehensive questionnaire that asks about\nnight time sleep patterns (questions 1 –3), factors that might\nawaken a subject from sleep (questions 4, 5, 8, 10,11,15), other\nevents that occur in the night (questions 6, 7, 9, 12,13,14). 2\nBecause the PDSS-2 scores is weighted to factors thatcause sleep\n0 4 8 1 21 62 02 42 83 23 64 04 4\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nPDSS 2\nNumber of \nValues\nControls   13%\nPwP 60%\nControls   7%\nPwP 48%\nControls\nPwP\nCombined Sleep Score\nC P\n<15 15-18 >18\nPDSS-2\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n0-3 yrControlSleep Score (\n/)\nCSS\nPDSS-2\n4-6 yr 7-12 yr .12 yr\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nCom\nbined Sleep Scor\ne\n<5% 5-10% >10%\n% of day time 09:00-18:00 BKS>80 (”asleep”)\n<5% 5-10% >10%\np=0.16\np=0.003\np=0.9\np=0.002\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nPD\nSS-2\na\ndc\n0\n10\n20\n30\nb\nC P C P\nFig. 4 Comparison of PKG score and PDSS 2 in Controls and PwP .a This shows cumulative frequency histograms of PDSS 2 scores for Control\nsubjects and PwP .

On the other hand, there is good correlation\nwith the sub scores that do relate to quality and quantity of night\ntime sleep. A further difﬁculty is that ~75% of the PKG’s scores\nrelates to sleep patterns of the 'normal' elderly sleeper whereas\n~75% of the PDSS 2 relates to factors causing abnormal sleep. The\nPDSS 2 is also non-linear: the transition from normal to moderate\nis by an increment of '2' and so also is the transition from\nmoderate to severe. These are not so much criticism as important\nreasons why concordance can be dif ﬁcult. Nevertheless, the\nsimilarities in detecting abnormal sleep and sleep progression\nwith disease duration and correlation with day time sleepiness\nsuggest that there is inherent agreement between the two ways\nof measuring nocturnal sleep in PD.\nIn conclusion, the CSS shows promise as a quantitative score for\nassessing sleep in Parkinson’s disease. Further study is required to\nunderstand its relationship to sleep architecture, although the SQ\nscore shows promise in this respect. Further studies are also\nrequired to establish whether the CSS or similar accelerometry\nscales could be developed as a tool to predict those subjects who\ndo or do not need PSG.\nMETHODS\nSubjects\nApproval for these studies were provided by St Vincent ’s Hospital\nMelbourne Ethics Committee and Monash Health Ethics Committee. All\nsubjects gave consent to participate and for the use of their data. Methods\nwere performed in accordance with relevant regulations and guideline\nControl subjects: a PKG logger was worn on each wrist by 155 subjects\naged over 60 and without a history or concern of a neurodegenerative\ndisorder. Subjects were not excluded because of the presence of diabetes,\ncardiac or respiratory problems that might affect sleep and these were\nassumed to be present to the same extent ad the PD subjects who were of\nsimilar age. Only three subjects reported having a diagnosed sleep\ndisorder and the Body Mass Index was the same as the PD subjects. At the\ntime of wearing the logger, they ﬁlled out a PDSS 2. Subjects were\nrecruited from Probus clubs, University of Third Age, Bowling Clubs and\nfrom the Parkinson’s Day Walk.\nPD subjects: 72 people with PD (PwP) attending the Movement Disorder\nClinic at St Vincent’s Hospital wore a PKG logger as part of their routine\ncare and were asked toﬁll out a PDSS 2 questionnaire. Subjects had PD for\na median of 6 years IQR:4–11 years and range 1.5–39 years).\nPSG subjects: 46 subjects underwent PSG. Most were referred for further\ninvestigation of a suspected sleep disorder. Ten had normal studies and\ntheir mean age was 29 y (IQR: 26.5–46.5 y). The mean age of the remaining\nsubjects with abnormal studies was 45 y (IQR: 38–53 y).\nThe Parkinson’s KinetiGraph system\nThe PKG (Global Kinetics Corporation) consists of a wrist worn data logger\nthat contains an accelerometer and memory sufﬁcient for 10 days of\ncontinuous recording. When recording was completed, data were down-\nloaded and analysed by proprietary algorithms that calculate a BKS and a\ndyskinesia score (DKS) every 2 min.\n24,25 In this study the PKG logger was\nworn continuously throughout the day and night for 6 days. PD subjects\nwore the PKG on the wrist of the most affected side. PSG subjects wore the\nPKG on the dominant hand overnight for the duration of the PSG study.\nThe control subjects wore the PKG on both wrists for 6 days and data were\ntaken from the wrist with the highest BKS.\nDeﬁnitions of PKG activity used in this study\nNP: The period between 23:00–06:00 on the days that the PKG was worn.\nBKS: BKS is calculated every 2 min throughout the period of time that\nthe logger is worn. The median BKS is the median value of BKS between\n09:00–18:00 and correlates with Uniﬁed Parkinson’s disease Rating Scale,\npart III (UPDRS III) for the patient.\n24,26\nDKS: DKS is calculated every 2 min throughout the period that the\nlogger is worn. The median DKS is the median value of DKS between\n09:00–18:00 and correlates with Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scales\n(AIMS) for the patient.24,26\nPTI: This is the proportion of BKS in a period of interest (e.g., the NP),\nwhose score is greater than 80. In previous studies,16,18 the PTI in the\nperiod 09:00–18:00 was found to correlate well with sleep as measured by\nambulatory PSG. As PTI an estimate of the proportion time asleep it is in\neffect an estimate of sleep efﬁciency.\nPTS: Movement can occur in sleep and so PTI may underestimate sleep\ndisrupted by movements from periodic limb movements or micro-arousals\nfrom either obstructive sleep apnoea or those that are spontaneous in\nnature. To address this, if 4 of 7 consecutive BKS (14 min) were >80 then\nthe central epoch (4th of 7) was deﬁned as 'sleep epoch'. The consecutive\nBKS were 'slid' forward in time by 1 BKS (i.e., 6/7 of the previous BKS were\nincluded and as before, if 4/7 were >80 then the 4th was deﬁned as a Sleep\nEpoch). This in effect applies a smoothing function to the PTI and is\nanother measure of sleep ef ﬁciency that should be less affected by\nperiodic limb movements or arousals.\nMFL: The extent to which sleep is fragmented may also reﬂect the\nquality of sleep. A fragment of sleep is deﬁned here as a run of BKS > 80\nand the length of that fragment is the number of BKS in that sequence. As\nBKS are 2 mins long, the length, in minutes is twice the number of BKS. In\nmost subjects, the distribution of fragment length is markedly hyperbolic,\nbut even though there is a high proportion of short fragments, most of the\nsleep (immobility) results from a small number of long fragments. Thus, a\nmeasure of sleep fragmentation would be to estimate the MFL in minutes.\nSQ: This is the percent the NP with where BKS > 110 and, as elaborated\nin Results section, has some relation to sleep architecture and is used here\nasan estimate of the quality of sleep.\nPTA: BKS < 80 is used as an estimate of time awake.\nNP: In the PSG lab, this is the proportion of time spent asleep\n(determined from the electroencephalograph) during the period from\nlights OFF–ON. This is difﬁcult at home with the PKG because it is only\npossible to assess when sleep began and not the period over which sleep\nwas attempted (i.e., in bed and trying to sleep). Instead the period from\n23:00–06:00 was used as the period of sleep: ~75% of people were asleep\nat 23:00 (or within 30 mins of 23:00) and >90% slept till at least 06:00\n(Supplementary Figure 1).\nPolysomnography (PSG)\nAll subjects (except those having PSG) ﬁlled out the PDSS 2. 2 PSG\nparticipants underwent a routine in-lab overnight sleep study using a\ncommercially available PSG system (Grael Sleep System, Compumedics).\nelectroencephalograms, electrooculograms, chin electromyogram (EMG),\nelectrocardiogram, left and right leg EMG and body position were\nrecorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured by pulse oximetry,\nthoracic and abdominal breathing movements recorded via uncalibrated\nrespiratory inductance plethysmography, and airﬂow was recorded via\nnasal pressure. Sleep, arousals and respiratory events were scored in 30 s\nepochs according to standard criteria (American Academy of Sleep\nMedicine Criteria27).\nData availability\nAll data generated or analysed during this study are included in this\npublished article (and its supplementary informationﬁles).\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe work was supported by an unrestricted grant from GKC to Malcolm Horne from\nGlobal Kinetics Corporation (GKC), the manufacturer and distributor of the\nParkinson’s KinetiGraph.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nM.H. conceived and supervised this study and analysed the data.
