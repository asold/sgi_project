Introduction \n            The energy losses in transformer are classified as no load losses and load losses which \ndivided into I \n2R and stray losses. The insulating medium (oil or SF6) is used for insulation and to \nremove heat from the winding and core assembly to surrounding [1]. The heat generated inside \ntransformer must be transfers to the insulating medium and further to surroundings via tank and \nheat exchanger. Although the winding copper holds its mechanical strength up to several \nhundreds degree Celsius and transformer oil dose not significantly degrade below about 140 \noC.The paper insulation deteriorates very rabidly if it s temperature exceeds 90 oC [2].It has \nbeen reported that from 90 to 110 oC the tensile strength aging rate is doubled for approximately \neach 8 oC increase in temperature [2].  Other authors have observed that the life of different \ntransformer insulation materials is halved by an increase in temperature ranging from 5 to 10 \ndegrees [3]. The  IEC 60354 loading guide for oil immersed power transformers [4], and the \nIEEE guide for loading mineral oil immersed transformer [5], indicate how oil immersed \ntransformers can be operated in different ambient conditions and load levels without exceeding \nthe acceptable deterioration limit of insulation due to thermal effects. \n         To increase transformer operational efficiency and minimize the probability of an \nunexpected outage, several on-line and off-line monitoring systems have been developed [6], \n[7-8], [9-10], and [11-12]. \n       /square6 \nTELKOMNIKA  Vol. 10, No. 1\n44 \n         Direct measurement of a \nhas been increasing since the mid \n \n \n2.

The applied \nload as a function of time is given in Figure 2. The obtained results are compared with \nthe measured values and agreement between them is noticed as shown in Figure 3. \n \n       /square6          ISSN: 1693-6930  \nTELKOMNIKA  Vol. 10, No. 1,  March 2012 :  43 – 54  \n50 \n3.2. SF6 Transformer \nThe SF6 gas transformer thermal model is applied on transformer 66/11. The \nmeasured temperature was in agreement with the calculated temperature as shown in \nFigure 5 .The load applied to this transformer as shown in Figure 4. The transformer \ncomponent temperatures are affected by circulation speed of the gas, the higher gas \nspeed the lower transformer component temperature. For comparison between gas \ninsulated gas cooled power transformer and oil immersed power transformer, 66/11 \nkV 25 MVA, 1200 Amp transformer insulated by oil and another transformer insulated \nby SF 6 gas. The effect of changing gas pressure and gas circulation velocity on the \ntransformer components temperature as shown in Figures 6 and 7 by applying the \nload cycle given in figure 8 on the SF6 and oil type transformer the temperature \ndistribution is given in figure 9.The reason of higher temperatures of SF 6 transformer is \ndue to the heat transfer coefficient of SF 6 gas is lower than the heat transfer in oil at \nstated gas pressure and forced gas velocity, also the thermal capacitance of oil is \nhigher than that of SF 6 gas.It can be noticed that the transformer compone nt \ntemperature decreases with the increase of SF 6 gas pressure. This is because the \nincrease in gas pressure causes an improvement in thermal capacity of the SF6 gas. \nAs given in Conti Elektro-Berichte [28] the heat transfer in SF 6 gas is equal to \nthe heat transfer in oil at SF 6 gas pressure = 2 MPa and gas velocity = 4.5 m/s, it is \nnoticed that the relationship between the SF 6 gas component temperatures and gas \npressure and also with forced gas velocity, when SF 6 gas pressure or velocity \nincreased, the SF 6 gas temperature also increased and transformer win dings \ntemparatures are decreased, and vise versa. For increasing the heat transfer and \nlowering the SF 6 gas transformer component temperature the gas pressure should be \nincreased from 0.24 to 2 MPa and forced gas velocity from 1.5 to 4.5 m/s. \n \n \n \nFigure 2.

Conclusions  \nTwo thermal mathematical models to simulate the heat flow and to calculate the cooling \nmedium temperature and the winding temperature of oil and SF \n6 transformers are presented \nand simulated by computer programs. The obtained results from the used models are in \nagreement with that measured in the field. Due to the higher thermal capacitance of the oil than \nthat of SF 6 gas, the heat transfer coefficient in oil is higher than that of SF 6 gas, so the \ntemperature of oil immersed power transformer component is lower than the temperature of SF 6 \ngas insulated gas cooled power transformer components having the same ratings.In SF6 \ntransformer the winding temperaturs are affected by gas pressure and temperature \nTemperatures in two transformers after increasing gas pressure \nto 0.5 MPa and gas circlation velocity to 4.5 MPa \n0\n10 \n20 \n30 \n40 \n50 \n60 \n70 \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 \nTime (h) \nT e m p e r a tu r e  (o c ) \ncalculated oil teperature \ncalculated SF6 gas temperature \ncalculated winding temperature in oil transformer \ncalculated winding temperature in SF6 transformer \nTemperature \nT (K) \n339.0 \n334.4 \n329.8 \n325.2 \n320.6 \n316.0 \n311.4 \n306.8 \n302.2 \n297.6 \n293.0 \nTemperature \nT (K) \n 316 \n 313 \n 310 \n 307 \n 304 \n 301 \n 298 \n 295 \n 292 \n 289 \n 286 \n       /square6          ISSN: 1693-6930  \nTELKOMNIKA  Vol. 10, No. 1,  March 2012 :  43 – 54  \n54 \nReferences \n[1]  Electric power transformer engineering ch 2 H.Jin Sim and Scott H. digby 2004. \n[2]  (Electra, 1990).
