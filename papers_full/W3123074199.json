Histori-\ncally, it has been used in conjunction with genotypes from highly polymorphic markers, such\nas DNA microsatellites or common SNPs. Traditional software performs rather poorly with\ndata from Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), which\nare now extensively used in medical genetics. We develop AutoMap, a tool that is both web-\nbased or downloadable, to allow performing homozygosity mapping directly on VCF (Variant\nCall Format) calls from WES or WGS projects. Following a training step on WES data from 26\nconsanguineous families and a validation procedure on a matched cohort, our method shows\nhigher overall performances when compared with eight existing tools. Most importantly,\nwhen tested on real cases with negative molecular diagnosis from an internal set, AutoMap\ndetects three gene-disease and multiple variant-disease associations that were previously\nunrecognized, projecting clear beneﬁts for both molecular diagnosis and research activities in\nmedical genetics.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20584-4 OPEN\n1 Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel (IOB), Basel, Switzerland.2 Department of Ophthalmology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.\n3 Department of Genetics and Genome Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.4 Institute of Experimental Pathology, Lausanne University Hospital\n(CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland.5 Service of Medical Genetics, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland.6 Department of Medical\nGenetics, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.7 Noncommunicable Diseases Research Center, Fasa University of\nSciences, Fasa, Iran.8 Department of Medical Genetics, Hospital Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Universitário Lisboa Norte (CHULN), Lisbon Academic\nMedical Center (CAML), Lisbon, Portugal.9 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.\n10 Division of Applied Medicine, Medical School, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.11 Medical Faculty, Lisbon University, Lisbon, Portugal.12 Instituto de\nOftalmologia Dr Gama Pinto, Lisbon, Portugal.✉email: carlo.rivolta@iob.ch\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS|          (2021) 12:518 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20584-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 1\n1234567890():,;\nH\nomozygosity mapping (HM), also called autozygosity\nmapping, is a technique aimed at detecting and scoring\nthe presence of consecutive homozygous genotypes, or\n“runs of homozygosity” (ROHs) in a person’s genome. ROHs\nresult from the co-inheritance of portions of DNA that are pre-\nvalent in a given population, and normally range from a few to\nhundreds of megabases (Mb), depending on the ethnic group\nconsidered1,2. In the offspring of consanguineous unions, ROHs\ncorrespond in large part to the genetic material that is co-\ninherited from ancestors who are common to both parents3. For\ninstance, children of parents who areﬁrst cousins have ROHs for\nDNA regions that were in heterozygosis in their great-grand-\nparents, and were inherited from both their maternal and\npaternal sides.\nIn patients with recessive conditions, especially if belonging to\na consanguineous pedigree, ROHs very often encompass the\nmutation that is responsible for the disease4, also originating from\na healthy heterozygous common ancestor, and therefore are\nexcellent proxy markers for the mutation itself. In addition, HM\ncan also be used to detect large heterozygous deletions resulting\nin hemizygous (and apparently homozygous) genotypes, as well\nas for cases of uniparental disomy5,6. For these reasons, HM has\nbeen used for decades in medical genetics as a tool to identify\nregions of the genome to be prioritized for targeted mutational\nscreens. In the past, HM procedures relied on genotypes from\npolymorphic markers (typically microsatellites) to determine\nwhether patients had consecutive homozygous calls vs. healthy\nrelatives. Since the beginning of this century, the commerciali-\nzation of high-density microarrays for single-nucleotide poly-\nmorphisms (SNPs) has allowed the use of the SNP genotypes for\nthe same purpose, by interrogating usually non-coding variants\nwith an elevated degree of heterozygosity in the general popula-\ntion. Several software were then developed, such as PLINK 7,\nHomozygosityMapper8, or GERMLINE9. In virtue of the very\nhigh accuracy of their calls (>99.8%)10, SNP microarrays outputs\nare highly reliable to identify ROHs. However, they do not pro-\nvide any information on a patient’s mutations, since these latter\nDNA variants are usually rare and therefore are not included in\nsuch arrays.\nConversely, information from whole-exome sequencing\n(WES), which is largely used in contemporary medical genetics,\nallows the discovery of any type of DNA variants, including\nfrequent genotypes and rare mutations alike. Therefore, at least in\nprinciple, WES can be used as a single technology for both HM\nand mutation detection. However, HM algorithms developed for\narray technologies tend to deliver sub-optimal results when\napplied to WES, since they are not adapted to handle the intrinsic\nnoise (2.53 –30.60%)10 that is typical of this sequencing\nmethod11–13. In particular, ROHs detected from WES data with\nthis software are smaller in size and produce lower cumulative\nautozygosity values, often resulting in the end in falsely-negative\noutput14–16. Hence, many investigators still make use of two\nseparate tools: SNP microarrays to determine ROHs, and WES to\nidentify possible rare mutations, with an important waste of time\nand resources17–21.\nTo circumvent this problem, in this work we present AutoMap\n(Autozygosity Mapper), a software that can provide very reliable\nHM results directly from standard WES outputs and is applicable\nto WGS (whole-genome sequencing) as an additional feature, and\ncompare it with other tools, including some that were speciﬁcally\ndeveloped to perform HM on WES data (BCFTools16, FILTUS22,\nH3M223, HOMWES15, SavvyVcfHomozygosity, and SavvyHo-\nmozygosity24). Each of the tools used in this comparison have\ntheir own strongpoints and limitations, such as the presence of a\ngraphical user interface (GUI), a cross-platform operative system,\na user-friendly output type, etc25,26. AutoMap is accessible both\nvia a web interface (free of charge), to allow low-throughput or\noccasional use for exome data, and as a command-line tool, for\nlarge-scale genomic projects, for WGS, and to allow integration\ninto routine analytical pipelines.\nResults and discussion\nAutoMap takes as an input variant call format (VCF) ﬁles\n(Fig. 1a), i.e., standard resultﬁles from a variety of commonly-\nused software for analyzing WES and WGS sequences (variant\ncallers), containing the list of DNA variants detected in a given\nsample with respect to the human reference genome. VCFﬁles\nhave the advantage of being of smaller size compared to primary\nmapping ﬁles (BAM ﬁles), contain most of the information\nthat can be used for HM purposes and, importantly, are generally\nmore available to the end-users, such as biologists or physicians.\nOf note, single-sample VCFs are accepted by both web and\nstandalone versions of AutoMap, while multisample VCFs are\nonly accepted by the standalone version. Once theﬁle is uploaded\nvia the web interface (https://automap.iob.ch/) the user simply\nlaunches the analysis, which in the end produces an output such\nas the one indicated in Fig.1b, c. This includes a PDFﬁle showing\nthe graphical representation of autozygous regions along the\nautosomes, as well as a textﬁle reporting the same information as\nnumerical values, with the positions of the detected ROHs, their\nsize, number of variants, and percentage of homozygosity.\nAutoMap can also include the X chromosome, if requested by the\nuser, for both females and males. In females, this chromosome is\ntreated as an autosome, whereas in males all hemizygous calls are\nconsidered as homozygous. In addition, it is possible to provide a\nlist of genes (or a“gene panel”, e.g., a list of genes linked to a\ngiven condition) as a textﬁle, to immediately recognize whether\nthey are or not within a given ROH (Fig.1c). The same procedure\ncan also be performed on a local computer, by directly down-\nloading the source ﬁles ( https://github.com/mquinodo/\nAutoMap). In its standalone version, AutoMap does not need\ncompiling but requires the installation of some additional soft-\nware (BCFTools, v1.9 or later; BEDTools, v2.25.0 or later; Perl,\nv5.22.0 or later; R, v3.2.0 or later).\nAs mentioned, one of the key points for the proper detec-\ntion of ROH from WES data is the targeted removal of false\npositive variant calls. These calls not only act as a noise with\nrespect to true signals, but also actively lead to an arti ﬁcial\nfragmentation of ROHs (when a heterozygous false positive\ncall is present in a truly autozygous region) or even to the\ncomplete miss of a ROH (for regions with a low number of\ncalls). To this end, as aﬁrst step, all variants from the VCFﬁle\nare carefully assessed with criteria relying on coverage and\nalternative reads count. More precisely, they are evaluated\naccording to their sequencing depth, the ratio between reads\naligned to the reference sequence vs. alternative alleles (for\nheterozygous calls), and to their location in repeated regions\nof the genome (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Variants\nthat do not satisfy these stringent criteria are selectively and\nindividually eliminated from further analyses. Importantly, all\nsuch criteria were veri ﬁed not to be speci ﬁc of any given\nvariant calling software, with the aim of enabling analyses of\nVCF ﬁles produced by various programs.\nAfter thisﬁltering step at the variant level, ROHs are identiﬁed\nby a sliding-window approach, associated with four tunable\nparameters: the size of the window, the minimal number of\nhomozygous variants in the window, the maximal gap between\ntwo consecutive variants in one ROH, and the maximal size of\nextension from the boundaries of stretches of detected ROHs\n(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Following their identiﬁca-\ntion, ROHs are then selected only if they reach a minimal value in\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20584-4\n2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS|          (2021) 12:518 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20584-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\nterms of size, number of variants and percentage of homozygous\ngenotypes in the region (Fig.1a and Supplementary Table 1).\nTo evaluate the performances of AutoMap, we gathered data\nfrom 52 families with recessive hereditary blindness, for which\nwe also had genotypes from both WES and SNP arrays, and\nselected one patient per family. These individuals were all from\nconsanguineous pedigrees living in Portugal or in Iran, i.e., in\ncountries with a low and an elevated degree of consanguinity at\nthe level of the general population, respectively\n27,28. More pre-\ncisely, they all had a median cumulative ROH size of 234.8 Mb\n(detected by PLINK on SNP array data), ranging between 90.6\nand 819.5 Mb. We then split these individuals into two matched\nsets of 26 persons each, thus deﬁning a training cohort and a\nmatched validation cohort (Supplementary Data 1). As a refer-\nence for true positive values, we adopted the method described by\nKancheva et al.15, consisting in the use of the PLINK software7\napplied with default parameters on data from SNP arrays.\nWe optimized the parameters of AutoMap on the training\ncohort (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1A, B, see\n“Methods” section), and then used the optimized values to ana-\nlyze the validation cohort. We performed stability analyses by\nvarying each parameter individually, which resulted in small\nvariation of the performances, indicative of the robustness of the\nmethod (Supplementary Fig. 1C). In addition, the average per-\nformance was not signiﬁcantly different between the two cohorts,\ndemonstrating no over-ﬁtting of the parameters on the training\ndata (Supplementary Fig. 2A). More precisely, speciﬁcity in the\ntraining and validation sets had values of 77.5% and 79.6%,\nrespectively ( p = 0.35, unpaired t-test), while sensitivity\nhad values of 90.5% and 92.4%, respectively (p = 0.18).\nWe also compared the effect of three mainstream variant\ncallers that could be adopted by AutoMap end users (GATK-\nHaplotype Caller, Samtools-mpileup and Strelka) on the perfor-\nmance of our tool (based on data from the training set). Auto-\nMap’s sensitivity was slightly lower when Strelka was used\n(−1.4% compared to Haplotype Caller), whereas speci ﬁcity\nappeared to be slightly lower when Samtools was used, (−4.4%\ncompared to Haplotype Caller, Supplementary Fig. 2B). These\ndifferences were all below 5%, therefore indicating that our tool is\noverall insensitive to the choice operated by a potential user with\nrespect to a given calling software.\nNext, we compared AutoMap with eight previously-published\ntools, namely: PLINK applied on exome data\n7, Homo-\nzygosityMapper for WES 29, HOMWES 15, BCFTools/RoH 16,\nFILTUS22,H 3M2 23, SavvyHomozygosity, and SavvyVcfHomo-\nzygosity24 on data from the validation cohort, composed of 26\nindividuals with various levels of autozygosity (Supplementary\nFig. 3). All of them were based on a hidden Markov model with\nthe exception of HomozygosityMapper, PLINK, and HOMWES,\nwhich were developed by applying a sliding window method (as it\nis the case for AutoMap as well). Of note, H3M2 and SavvyHo-\nmozygosity cannot process VCF ﬁles but need a BAM ﬁle\n(sequence alignment data), HomozygosityMapper is only avail-\nable via a web interface, and FILTUS can only be queried via a\nFig. 1 AutoMap workﬂow and example of output. aWorkﬂow followed by AutoMap with default settings,b, c example of graphical and text output for\npatient NSI-326, with the following parameters: DP= 8, percaltlow= 0.25, percalthigh= 0.75, binomial= 0.000001, maxgap= 10, window=7,\nwindowthres =5, minsize= 2, minvar= 25, minperc= 88, chrX=No, and extend= 1.

The use SavvyHomozygosity and Sav-\nvyVcfHomozygosity requires the downloading of pre-prepared\nlinkage data from 1000 Genomes project or a joint vcf from a few\nhundred WGS. We did not include other software packages such\nas Agile-Genotyper, Agile-VariantMapper\n14, and HomSI30 since\nthey do not provide a genome-wide resultﬁle, which could be\nused as source of data for comparison, but only a graphical\noutput. We used default parameters for all these tools (i.e., the\nparameters optimized by their respective authors to analyze WES\ndata), except for PLINK, since this software wasﬁrst developed\nfor SNP array data and therefore had to be re-parametrized to\nallow its use on WES genotypes (see“Methods” section).\nAutoMap and SavvyVcfHomozygosity had the best sensitivity/\nspeciﬁcity combination and the highestF-score when compared\nto other software (p < 3.0 × 10−7, paired t-test) (Fig. 2a, b).\nHowever, AutoMap had a signiﬁcantly higher sensitivity than\nSavvyVcfHomozygosity (p < 2.9 × 10−6) and lower speciﬁcity\n(p < 2.8 × 10−6).\nIn addition, AutoMap (on WES) was the tool that displayed the\nclosest values, in terms of ROHs size and number, to the reference\n(i.e., PLINK on SNP array) (Fig.3). This indicated no or very low\nROH fragmentation, especially in comparison to other tools,\nwhich produced for instance either a high number of small and\nfragmented ROHs (H\n3M2, FILTUS, and PLINK) or detected only\nlarge ROHs (SavvyVcfHomozygosity). Two representative\nexamples of this effect, over entire choromosomes, are presented\nin Supplementary Fig. 4.\nSince small ROHs are more difﬁcult to detect and indeed could\npenalize the global performance of some of these tools, we\nrepeated the same analysis by considering only ROHs larger than\n5 Mb, being aware that such regions are more likely to harbor\ncausative variants for recessive diseases4. As expected, every tool\ndisplayed increased performances, due to the artiﬁcial clearing of\nFig. 2 Performance of AutoMap and other tools on data from the validation set. a, b Performance of AutoMap for ROHs larger than 1 Mb (Megabase):\na speciﬁcity and sensitivity;b F-score. c, d Same analyses as ina, b, but limited to ROHs with sizes of 5 Mb or higher (most likely to contain causative\nrecessive mutations in medical genetics practice, according to published literature).

AutoMap had a signiﬁcant higher sensitivity than SavvyVcf-\nHomozygosity (p = 2.9 × 10−6) but lower than SavvyHomo-\nzygosity (p < 6.9 × 10−9). Concerning speciﬁcity, the results were\nreversed, with AutoMap having a signiﬁcantly higher value than\nSavvyHomozygosity (p < 3.0 × 10−3) but a lower score with\nrespect to SavvyVcfHomozygosity (p < 2.5 × 10−5). In summary,\nAutoMap had the best performances overall when tested on our\nvalidation cohort. Since this cohort comprised only individuals of\nEuropean and South Asian ancestry, further assessments may be\nneeded to evaluate population-speci ﬁc performances on data\nfrom other ethnic groups. In addition, a possible confounding\nfactor in our analysis could be represented by the use of different\ncapture kits for WES. Although we did not assess this parameter\nat the experimental level, previous literature has shown that\nconcordance rates of called variants across different capture kits\nare very elevated31, making substantial variability of performance\nlinked to the use of different kits a rather unlikely event. Con-\ncerning WGS data, additional tests will be also needed to\nbenchmark existing tools such as PLINK or other array-speciﬁc\nsoftware vs. AutoMap, due to the difference in terms of number\nof variants and coverage compared to WES.\nIn addition to an increased performance in retrieving ROHs\nfrom exome data, AutoMap also displayed other beneﬁts. For\ninstance, AutoMap was the only tool that could be run both via a\nweb application (for the average user) and the command-line, to\nallow more computationally-inclined users to exploit its full\npotential. In addition, the average processing time displayed by\nAutoMap was relatively short, especially in relationship to its\nperformance. All tools, except those using BAMﬁles as an input\n(H3M2 and SavvyHomozygosity) could analyze a standard VCF\nin 30 s or less. The fastest tools were BCFTools and PLINK,\ncompleting the analysis in less than 5 s, while AutoMap took\napproximately 20 s. A more detailed comparison of all these\nfeatures is provided in Supplementary Table 2.\nAs a ﬁnal test, we used AutoMap on unexplored WGS and\nWES research data from our laboratory, for cases with unknown\nmolecular etiology. Following experimental validation, our tool\nwas instrumental in the end for identifying both coding and\nnoncoding mutations, all included into larger ROHs, for a few\nnew syndromes. These included: an intergenic deletion causing\ndevelopmental defects\n32, a small deletion affecting splicing in the\ngene PISD and resulting in the Liberfarb syndrome33, and a\npartial duplication of theNMNAT1 gene, responsible for a new\nmultisystem disorder34. Compared to the other tools analyzed,\nAutoMap was the only one allowing the complete detection of the\nautozygous regions containing the mutations in all three cases\n(Supplementary Table 3). For theNMNAT1 study, for example,\nthe lack of performance displayed by some other tools was likely\ndue to the presence of a few false-positive heterozygous variants\nin the ROH containing the pathogenic duplication, which were\nindeed recognized as such— and hence discarded— by AutoMap.\nThe same was true for the two other studies, where the presence\nof false-positive heterozygous genotypes was combined with the\nrelatively short size of ROHs and/or the presence of a limited\nnumber of identiﬁable genotypes. In addition, AutoMap enabled\nthe detection of new variants in a number of genes that were\nalready associated with Mendelian conditions35–37. In conclusion,\nAutoMap is a reliable tool that can predict ROHs with high\nspeciﬁcity and sensitivity, in less than a minute, even from VCF\nﬁles derived from noisy exome sequencing data. It is available\nboth via a web-based interface, for a quick analysis, as well as a\ncommand-line package, allowing large-scale and routine analyses.\nMethods\nPatients and DNA. This study adhered to the to the tenets of the Declaration of\nHelsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of our respective\ninstitutions: the Ethikkommission Nordewest- and Zentralschweiz (2019-01660),\nthe Institutional Review Boards of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences\n(961015), the ethics commission of the Ophthalmic Hospital“Dr Gama Pinto” in\nLisbon (16.05.20) and the Noncommunicable Diseases Research Center of Fasa\nUniversity of medical sciences (IR.FUMS.REC.1396.211). Written informed con-\nsent forms were signed by all subjects, recruited at the Ophthalmic Hospital“Dr\nGama Pinto” in Lisbon, and at the Fasa and Mashhad Universities of Medical\nScience in Iran. Participants had either reported consanguinity or had ~100 Mb or\nmore of cumulative ROHs as determined by PLINK applied on array data (Sup-\nplementary Data 1). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leuko-\ncytes. More precisely, for Portuguese patients DNA extraction was performed by\nusing the EZ1 DNA blood kit and EZ1 DNA buffy coat card (Qiagen), according to\nthe manufacturer’s instructions, choosing an elution volume of 200μl. For Iranian\npatients, DNA was extracted from blood using RPN8512 Nucleon BACC3 DNA\nExtraction Kit (Illustra).\nArray genotyping. DNA of studied individuals were genotyped at the iGE3\nPlatform of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, using Illumina Inﬁnium arrays\n(San Diego, USA; GSAMD-24v2.0, GSA-24v2.0, CoreExome-24v1.1, and\nCoreExome-24v1.2). Genotypes values were obtained with GenomeStudio\n(Illumina).\nExome sequencing. Exome capture and library preparation was performed using\nthe SureSelect Human All Exon v6 kit (Agilent, SantaClara, USA) and HiSeq Rapid\nPE Cluster Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, USA) with 2μg genomic DNA. Libraries\nwere sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 or a NovaSeq 6000 instruments (Illumina)\n(Supplementary Data 1). Raw reads were mapped to the human genome reference\nsequence (build hg19) with the Novoalign software (V3.08.00, Novocraft Tech-\nnologies, Selangor, Malaysia). Duplicate reads were then removed using Picard\n(v. 2.14.0-SNAPSHOT). Base quality score recalibration was performed and variant\ncalling was done with HaplotypeCaller (GATK, v.4.0.3.0).\nAutoMap requirements. AutoMap is composed of Bash, Perl and R scripts. It\nrequires BCFTools (≥v1.9), BEDTools (≥v2.25.0), Perl (≥v5.22.0), and R (≥v3.2.0).\nThe following versions were used for all analysis: BCFTools (v1.9-78-gb7e4ba9),\nBEDTools (v2.25.0), Perl (v5.22.0), Bash (4.3.48(1)-release) and R (v3.5.1).\nTo be processed by AutoMap, a VCFﬁle must contain the GT (genotype) and\nAD (allelic depths for the ref and alt alleles) or DP4 (number of high-quality ref-\nforward bases, ref-reverse, alt-forward, and alt-reverse bases)ﬁelds.\nF\nH\nV\nS\nA\n3\nPW B\n0\n4\n8\n12\n0 40 80 120 160 200\nAverage number of ROHs\nMedian of ROH size averages [Mb]\nAutoMap\nBCFTools\nFiltus\nH3M2\nHOMWES\nA\nB\nF\n3\nW\nHomozygosityMapper\nPLINK\nSavvyHomozygosity\nSavvyVcfHomozygosity\nSNP−array PLINK\nH\nP\nS\nV\n*\nFig. 3 Average number of ROH detected per sample (N = 26) vs. the\nmedian of the size averages of ROHs per sample (ROHs larger than\n1M b ) .The asterisk indicates the reference value used for comparison, i.e.,\ndata from SNP arrays analyzed with PLINK.

The ﬁrst step of the algorithm removes variants from the\nVCF ﬁle that are located in repeat regions, as reported by the UCSC genome\nbrowser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables). Variants are thenﬁltered by\nquality, based on the percentage of alternative reads (default options:–minpercalt\n0.25 and –maxpercalt 0.75), on a binomial test for alternative and reference read\ncounts for heterozygous variants (default option:–binomial 0.000001), and on\ndepth (default option:–DP 8). At this point, the analysis is stopped if there are less\nthan 10,000 variants surviving such procedures.\nROHs are subsequently detected by a sliding window with aﬁxed size and a\nthreshold based on the number of homozygous variants (default options:–window\n7 variants and–windowthres 5). After that, detected ROHs are trimmed at their\nends to remove heterozygous variants and are extended at both ends (default\noption: –extend 1 [Mb]). ROHs containing regions without variants for a stretch\nlarger than a given threshold (default option:–maxgap 10 [Mb]) are split into two\ndifferent ROHs by excluding the region with no variants. Finally, ROHs areﬁltered\nto have a minimal size, a minimal number of variants and a minimal percentage of\nhomozygous variants (default options:–minsize 1 [Mb],–minvar 25, and–minperc\n88 [%]).\nProbabilities for binomial distribution. Probabilities for binomial distributions\nwere calculated with the Perl script written by T.J. Finney (https://www.halotype.\ncom/RKM/ﬁgures/TJF/binomial.txt).\nOverlap of ROHs. Overlap of ROHs were obtained with bedtools and the fol-\nlowing command:\nbedtools intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed\nParameters used to detect ROHs from array data. PLINK was used with default\nparameters, except for variants with minor allele count of 2 per batch, forﬁltering\nagainst very rare variants, often representing false-positive\n38,39:\nplink –bﬁle bﬁle –homozyg –out out–homozyg-window-het 1 –homozyg-density\n50 –homozyg-gap 1000 –homozyg-window-missing 5 –homozyg-window-snp 50 –\nhomozyg-snp 100 –homozyg-window-threshold 0.05 –homozyg-kb 1000 –mac 2\nDetection of ROHs from exome data. All available tools were used with default\nparameters for treating inputﬁles, optimized by their developers, except for\nPLINK. For this tool, we took the parameters deﬁned by Kancheva et al.15,t o\noptimize sensitivity, and re-tested the most important parameter, i.e., the number\nof allowed heterozygous SNP per ROH. This parameter is important to take in\naccount the noise in exome sequencing data. Indeed, low values of this parameter\nresulted in low sensitivity. We chose to use a value of 3 since it produced a higher\nsensitivity with acceptable speciﬁcity (Supplementary Fig. 5).\nThe command used was:\nplink –bﬁle bﬁle –homozyg –out out–homozyg-kb 1000–homozyg-window-het 3\n–homozyg-density 10000 –homozyg-gap 10000 –homozyg-window-missing 10 –\nhomozyg-window-snp 20 –homozyg-snp 10 –homozyg-window-threshold 0.05\nFor SavvyHomozygosity and SavvyVcfHomozygosity, we used the pre-prepared\nlinkage data from 1000 Genomes project, provided by the developers (https://\ngithub.com/rdemolgen/SavvySuite).\nParameter used for variant callers. Samtools:\nsamtools mpileup -t DP,AD -ugf ref.fasta input.bam|bcftools call -vmO v -o out.\nvcf\nStrelka:\nconﬁgureStrelkaGermlineWorkﬂow.py –bam input.bam–referenceFasta ref.fasta\n–exome\nHaplotypeCaller:\ngatk –java-options “-Xmx4g” HaplotypeCaller -R ref.fasta–dbsnp dbsnp.vcf -I\n$input.bam -O out.vcf\nAfter calling, variants wereﬁltered to be present in the regions included in the\ncapture kits, with a 100 bp padding on each side.\nComputations of performances. As a reference for true positive values, we\nadopted the method described by Kancheva et al.\n15, consisting in the use of the\nPLINK software7 applied with default parameters on data from SNP arrays. Sen-\nsitivity and speciﬁcity were then computed as follows:\nSensitivity %ðÞ ¼ ROHexome/C0 all overlapping with ROHarray/C0 filtered=Total ROHarray/C0 filtered;\nSpecificity %ðÞ ¼ ROHexome/C0 filtered overlapping with ROHarray/C0 all=Total ROHexome/C0 filtered;\nwhere ﬁltered ROHs are larger than 1 or 5 Mb and excluding gap regions such as\ncentromeres, telomeres, short arms, and heterochromatin deﬁned from the gap\ntable in UCSC Table Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables).\nF-score was also added as a measure of accuracy, computed as:\nF/C0 score ¼ 2 /C3 sensitivity /C3 specificity= sensitivity þ specificityðÞ :\nStatistical tests. T-test were performed with t.test function in RStudio (v1.0.153)\nwith R (v3.5.1).\nFor paired test:t.test(x, y, alternative= “two.sided”, paired= TRUE)\nFor unpaired test:t.test(x, y, alternative= “two.sided”, paired= FALSE)\nFigures. Figures were done with ggplot2 (v3.3.2) and gridExtra (v2.3) packages in\nRStudio (v1.0.153) with R (v3.5.1).\nReporting summary. Further information on research design is available in the Nature\nResearch Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nArray genotyping data and exome sequencing data cannot be shared because of\nrestrictions related to the protection of personal data, as per Swiss and European law.\nData from Figs.2 and 3 can be retrieved in the Source Dataﬁle.
