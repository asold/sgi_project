However, the\nneural circuits underpinning tool use and how neural activity varies with an\nanimal’st o o lp r oﬁciency, are only known for humans and some other pri-\nmates. We use 18F-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to\nimage the brain activity of naïve vs trained American crows (Corvus brachyr-\nhynchos) when presented with a task requiring the use of stone tools. As in\nhumans, talent affects the neural circuits activated by crows as they prepare to\nexecute the task. Naïve and less proﬁcient crows use neural circuits associated\nwith sensory- and higher-order processing centers (the mesopallium and\nnidopallium), while highly proﬁcient individuals increase activity in circuits\nassociated with motor learning and tactile control (hippocampus, tegmentum,\nnucleus basorostralis, and cerebellum). Greater proﬁciency is found primarily\nin adult female crows and may reﬂect their need to use more cognitively\ncomplex strategies, like tool use, to obtain food.\nTool use was once considered unique to humans, yet is now known\nfrom multiple vertebrates, and even among some invertebrates1.\nDespite its occurrence across a diversity of taxonomic classes, tool use\nbehavior is not universal or even common among other taxa within the\nsame family or genus, even though most possess the requisite mor-\nphology, as evidenced by their capacity to learn tool use in captivity\n2– 4.\nConsidering the advantages it affords the practitioner, why don’tw e\nsee more widespread tool use among the other species belonging to\ngroups where at least one species utilizes tools?\nWhile scientists no longer consider advanced cognition and\nbehavioralﬂexibility to be requisite for tool use– as demonstrated by\ngenetically heritable and stereotyped tool use behaviors found among\narthropods\n5 and ﬁsh6 – these traits tend to be common among species\nthat must learn to use tools1. Researchers may be able to explore why\nmore animals don’t use tools by examining the brain’s active regions\nwhen the subject uses a tool. Two distinct neural circuits guide and\nshape tool use in humans and non-human primates; one circuit is\nresponsible for the semantic knowledge of the tool while the other\ncontrols the learned motor skills required to effectively use the tool\n7– 9.\nHowever, whether other tool-using animals possess functionally simi-\nlar neural circuitry is not known.\nMany members of the avian family Corvidae (corvids) show\ncomplex behavior comparable to the great apes; both groups possess\nequivalent forebrain neuronal counts\n10 and can solve novel challenges\nwith similar speed andﬂexibility11. However, only the New Caledonian\ncrow (Corvus moneduloides)is a habitual tool user12; other corvids only\noccasionally use tools in the wild13, though they are capable of learning\na variety of tools in captivity14. Individual variation in the ability of\noccasional tool users (such as American crows; Corvus brachyr-\nhynchos) to learn and master the use of novel tools offers a window\ninto the physical and neural attributes that favor adopting tool use.\nHere, we capture 16 wild American crows and use 18F-\nﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to\nexplore the neurological activity associated with their proﬁciency at\nlearning the Aesop’s fable paradigm (hereafter Aesop’s fable task)\nrequiring the use of a novel tool (Fig.1).

We have previously utilized FDG-PET imaging\nto examine avian neural activity16– 19 because, unlike many in vivo\nimaging modalities, the subject can be awake and unrestrained when\nexposed to the experimental stimulus, thus reducing a source of stress\nthat can confound the recorded neurological activity. We scanned all\ncrows twice;ﬁrst before they had ever been exposed to the Aesop task\n(hereafter Pre-training scan), and second after the birds were trained\nto retrieve food from the Aesop tube (hereafter Post-training scan).\nThus, the imaging procedure and stimulus remained precisely the\nsame between pre- and post-training scans, with the only difference\nbeing the crows’ level of experience using tools to solve the visible\ntask. We expect proﬁcient crows to show increased activity (compared\nto naïve or less proﬁcient crows) in brain regions previously identiﬁed\nas enlarged in New Caledonian crows that regularly use tools: the\nmesopallium, striatal complex, septum, and tegmentum\n20. We also\nexpect proﬁcient birds to activate their NCL due to its association with\ntool use21, and hippocampus due to its association with memory22.W e\nﬁnd activity within the pallial regions (mesopallium and nidopallium)\nfor naïve and less proﬁcient crows, while highly proﬁcient crows show\nactivation in memory, motor, and tactile associated regions (hippo-\ncampus, tegmentum, nucleus basorostralis, and cerebellum). We\nadditionally use behavioral observation and computerized tomo-\ngraphy (CT) to examine the physical factors (such as sex, body size,\nand brain volume) associated with task proﬁciency. We expect hunger\nlevel or body condition\n23, age or experience24, sex or social status25,a n d\ntemperament26 to affect motivation to use and master tools, andﬁnd\nthat age and sex are the greatest predictors of tool mastery (adult\nfemales are most proﬁcient).\nResults\nTask proﬁciency\nCrows varied dramatically in their degree of mastery of the Aesop’s\nfable task, with only four of the 16 crows fully mastering it (Fig.1vi;\nhigh-proﬁciency). Of the 12 birds that did not master the task, four\nnever dropped any balanced training stones (Fig.1iv; low-proﬁciency)\nand eight never picked up + dropped any hanging training stones\n(Fig. 1v; medium-proﬁciency).\nPre- and Post-training differential brain activity\nCompared to their post-training scan, the crows showed three distinct\nregions of signiﬁcantly higher FDG uptake within the brain during their\npre-training scan, regardless of their eventual proﬁciency with the task.\nStarting with the most rostral region (Fig.2A), the crows showed\nbilateral subthreshold activation within the lateral mesopallium, with\npeak loci near the border between mesopallium and nidopallium (left\nhemisphere: 8.2% more activity,Z = 4.53; right hemisphere: 8.6% more,\nZ = 4.22). The second region (Fig.2B) contained the most widespread\nsubthreshold activation and included loci in the right hemisphere\ndorsal mesopallium (7.4% more activity,Z = 4.82) and dorsal nido-\npallium (7.2% more,Z = 5.24). The latter continued caudally toward a\nmore ventral portion of the nidopallium (6.9% more,Z =4 . 3 1 ) o f t h e\nright hemisphere. The presence of subthreshold activity (albeit less\nwidespread) and a locus in the left hemisphere mesopallium (5.1%\nmore activity,Z = 4.27) suggest a limited degree of bilaterality to this\nactivity. The region of signiﬁcantly increased activity in the caudal\nnidopallium (Fig.2D) appeared to be lateral to the medial portion of\nthe nidopallium caudolaterale (NCLm); while the activities were bilat-\nerally observed (left hemisphere: 8.9% more activity,Z = 4.01; right\nhemisphere: 7.8% more activity,Z = 4.57), the subthreshold activity was\nmore widespread in the right hemisphere. There was an additional\nregion (Fig.2C) of notably higher activity that did not exceed theZ-\nthreshold of 4.0; it was also located within the caudal nidopallium,\nthough more rostrally to the previous region and primarily limited to\nthe left hemisphere (8.2% more,Z = 3.80). See Supplementary Fig. 1 in\nSI for differential activity patterns throughout the entire brain.\nWe found no differences in post-training neural activity that were\nconsistent across all crows. However, when we subdivided the crows\nby task proﬁciency, we found that the high-proﬁciency birds showed\nsigniﬁcantly increased activity medially within their left hemisphere\ntegmentum after their training, relative to before (8.2% more,Z =4 . 1 6 ,\nFig. 3). This activity was found in a small region just caudal to the\ntuberal nucleus, possibly including the ventral tegmental area. See\nSupplementary Fig. 2 in SI for differential activity patterns throughout\nthe entire brain.\nProﬁciency-based differential brain activity\nAfter training, crow proﬁciency at solving the Aesop’sf a b l et a s kw a s\nassociated with differences in brain activity. Compared to the birds\nwith low-proﬁciency, crows that were highly proﬁcient at solving the\ntask showed signiﬁcantly more activity within the right hemisphere\nhippocampus (9.1% higher activity,Z = 4.44) and dorsally within both\nhemispheres of the caudal cerebellum (left: 9.8% more activity,\nZ =4 . 8 9 ;r i g h t :1 5 %m o r ea c t i v i t y ,Z = 4.23), along with notably higher\nactivity in the left hemisphere nucleus basorostralis (3.3% more activ-\nity, Z = 3.77) upon seeing the Aesop’s task during their post-training\nscan (Fig. 4A). By contrast, low-proﬁciency crows showed notably\nmore activity within the left hemisphere mesopallium, adjacent to (and\npossibly including) the mesopallium ventro-lateralis (MVL) (10.3%\nmore activity,Z = 3.92), and the left hemisphere hyperpallium apicale\nWild\nAviary\nHabitua/g415on\nTraining\nS/g415mulus\nhidden (30 s)\nS/g415mulus\nrevealed (60 s)\nImaging \nLabA\nB C\nD E\nPost-training \nscan\nPre-training \nscan\nWild\nF\nStandard\nApparatus\nx7\ni\niii\nBalanced\nTraining\niv Hanging\nTraining\nv\nReturn to \nStandard\nvi\nii\nFig. 1 | Overview of our methodology.We captured crows from the wild (A)a n d\nhoused them in an outdoor aviary. For two weeks, we regularly habituated the\ncrows to the conditions of the imaging process, including temporarily placing them\nin a smaller cage enclosed by panels that blocked all external view except that of an\n(empty) adjacent stimulus stage (B). During habituation, they could not enter the\nempty stimulus stage. We transported crows from the aviary to the imaging lab for\ntheir baseline pre-training scan; this was theﬁrst time the naïve crows were exposed\nto the materials they would use to perform an Aesop’s fable task (C). During the\nimaging process, we stimulated the crows by alternatively revealing (i) and hiding\n(ii) the interior of the well-lit stimulus stage and the task materials within. We\nreturned crows to the aviary and modiﬁed the habituation process to train them to\nthe task; they could now access the materials within the stimulus stage (D). We used\na standard apparatus (iii) during training until we had established the maximum\nreachable depth for the crow– if we lowered the water level beyond this point, the\ncrow could not reach the food without dropping at least one stone into the tube.\nWe taught crows that the stones could be used as tools to raise the water level by\nintroducing training stones to the rim of the tube (iv). Training stones are con-\nnected to the tube’s interior via lines, preventing them from falling outside the\ntube, and crows usually push them in as they reach for the food. We increased the\ndifﬁculty by suspending the training stones along the tube’s exterior, which pre-\nvented them from being knocked inside accidentally (v), beforeﬁnally removing\nthem and returning to the standard arrangement (vi). After imparting differential\ntask proﬁciency, we returned the crows to the imaging laboratory for their post-\ntraining scan (E). We released crows back to the wild several days after theﬁnal\nscan (F).\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42203-8\nNature Communications|         (2023) 14:6539 2\n(21.6% more,Z = 3.79) compared to the high-proﬁciency birds (Fig.4B),\nthough neither region exceeded theZ-threshold for statistical sig-\nniﬁcance (Z = 4.0). Although they showed much individual variability,\nthe mean activity of medium-proﬁciency crows tended to be inter-\nmediate between that of the high- and low-proﬁciency birds in the\nregions previously mentioned (Fig.4A, B). Additionally, the medium-\nproﬁciency crows had notably more activity laterally within the left\nhemisphere mesopallium (23.9% more activity, Z =3 . 9 0 , F i g .4C)\ncompared to the highly proﬁcient birds. See Supplementary Figs. 3– 5\nin SI for differential brain activity throughout the entire brain for each\ncomparison.\nWe additionally imaged the four highly proﬁcient crows oneﬁnal\ntime after their post-training scan. During this 3rd scan, we allowed the\nbird to enter the stimulus stage and directly interact with the Aesop\ntask apparatus. Brain activity during tool use differed little from post-\ntraining observation of the apparatus (see Supplementary Fig. 6 in SI\nfor localized areas consistent with the nidopallium or arcopallium; one\nZ =4 . 0 ,a l lo t h e r s< 3 . 4 ) .\nCrow individual measures\nWe sampled 10 males and 6 females, with the sexes equally divided by\nage (n = 3 adult and 3 subadult females,n = 5 adult and 5 subadult\nmales). They varied in size (culmen length: mean ± SD = 50.0 ± 2.9\nmm), body condition (0.00 ± 18.08 g), level of nervousness\n(31.94 ± 10.95 movements/min), and brain volume during theirﬁrst\nscan (absolute brain volume: 7.56 ± 0.68 cm\n3; relative brain volume:\n00 ± 0.50 cm3). Though not signiﬁcant, there was a slight decrease in\nthe crows’ level of nervousness during their time in captivity (ﬁrst\nmeasure: 38.00 ± 11.69 movements/min; second measure: 33.50 ± 13.17\nmovements/min; t15 =1 . 9 4 ,P = 0.07). Despite only having access to\nfood for several hours each day, the crows gained a signiﬁcant amount\nof weight during their time in captivity (capture: 387.5 ± 31.4 g; release:\n415.0 ± 37.87 g;t\n15 =6 . 1 2 ,P < 0.001). See Supplementary Table 1 in SI\nfor the individual measures of each crow. As expected, many of the\nindividual measures were correlated, which reﬂected typical allometry\nand sex differences (females are smaller; Supplementary Table 2 in SI).\nIn addition, crows with high body condition scores were less nervous\nthan those with low scores (r = −0.58, t\n14 = −2.69, P =0 . 0 1 7 ) .\nIndividual factors and task proﬁciency\nA crow’s estimated age was the most important factor associated with\nproﬁciency; it was the only competitive model and garnered 90% of\nthe weight of evidence, primarily because the high-proﬁciency group\nconsisted exclusively of adults (Table1,F i g .5A). Despite this, age alone\nis an unreliable predictor of crow task proﬁciency because the adult\ncrows were also the demographic with the worst performance; three of\nthe four remaining adults never progressed beyond low-proﬁciency.\nBy contrast, seven of the eight subadults achieved medium-proﬁciency\nwith the task. This reveals a curious trend where adult crows are highly\nbimodal in tool adoption, whereas the subadults are consistently\nintermediate.\nWithin the adult crows, the models for absolute brain volume, sex,\nand body size were all competitive, collectively garnering 81% of the\nweight of evidence, although the model for sex failed to converge\nproperly because all the adult females solved the task (Table2). The\nsuccessful adult crows were primarily female (Fig.5C )a n dt e n d e dt o\nhave smaller culmen length (did solve: mean ± SD = 46.5 ± 3.0 mm; did\nnot solve: 51.3 ± 0.96 mm) and smaller absolute brain volume than\nunsuccessful adults (did solve: 7.05 ± 0.45 cm\n3; did not solve:\n8.00 ± 0.64 cm3)( F i g .5B, D). Although not competitive, the models\nindicate the adults that mastered the task also had a slight tendency to\nbe in better body condition (did solve: 8.39 ± 17.68 g; did not solve:\n−4.79 ± 3.67 g), less nervous (did solve: 25.5 ± 7.56 move/min; did not\nsolve: 34.0 ± 11.75 move/min), and have less variable relative brain\nvolume (did solve:−0.12 ± 0.33 cm\n3;d i dn o ts o l v e :0 . 0 8 ± 0 . 6 5 c m3)\ncompared to the other adults (Supplementary Fig. 7 in SI).\n-5.0\n-1.64\nZ\nM/N M/N\nA19.0\nRL\nA18.2\nN\nA11.0\nN\nA9.4\nN\nA7.8\nM M\nA13.8\nN N\nA5.0\nRL\n((A) (B) (C) (D)\nFDG uptake normalized to global values\nPre-Training Post-TrainingScan:\nFig. 2 | Pre- versus post-training differential brain activity for all crows.Top:\nCoronal view of voxel-wise subtractions (converted to Z-score maps) showing\ndifferential FDG uptake at the indicated region for all the crows’pre-training scan\ncompared to their post-training scan (n = 14 crows).

The three adult females that solved the task repre-\nsented 100% of that demographic in our sample group, whereas the\nsingle male in this proﬁciency group represented only 20%. By con-\ntrast, three of the four low-proﬁciency crows were adult males. The\nother two factors– body size and absolute brain volume– are likely\nonly competitive because of the strong allometric correlation between\nsex, culmen length, and brain volume (Supplementary Table 2 in SI);\nfemale American crows are smaller than males\n27 and smaller animals\ntend to have correspondingly smaller brains28. Relative brain volume\ncorrects for this allometry, and it shows no relationship with task\nproﬁciency (Supplementary Fig. 7 in SI).\nDiscussion\nImaging brain activity as individual birds were challenged to master\nthe use of a novel tool provided a unique window into the neural\nchanges that underpin learning invertebrates. Because the Aesop’s\nfable task was difﬁcult for crows to learn, we could separate birds\ninto proﬁciency categories and relate their physical features and\nneural activity to their degree of task mastery. We were able to track\napproximate synaptic activity throughout the whole brain of each\nbird before and after they became familiar with the tool-using task\nbecause of the relatively non-invasive imaging technique we\nemployed (PET).\nCrows wereﬁrst exposed to the Aesop’s fable task during their\npre-training scan, and they showed signiﬁcantly increased FDG uptake,\na surrogate of brain activity, throughout their mesopallium and nido-\npallium compared to their post-training scan. This activity was nearly\nuniversal among all crows, regardless of their eventual task proﬁ-\nciency. The low- and medium-proﬁciency birds continued to show\nelevated activity in their mesopallium when scanned after weeks of\nexperience with the task (compared to the high-proﬁciency birds),\nalthough the activity of the low-proﬁciency birds varied greatly\nbetween individuals compared to the medium- and high-proﬁciency\ngroups. Both regions are known to be heterogenous entities in con-\nnection and function, and are involved with various sensory informa-\ntion and higher-order cognitive ability\n29– 31. The mesopallium is an\nassociative forebrain region that does not receive direct sensory\ninformation from the thalamus and has been suggested to be corre-\nlated with behavioral innovation andﬂexibility\n32. A sub-region within\nthe nidopallium, the NCL in particular, has been compared to the\nmammalian prefrontal cortex in controlling executive function,\nworking memory, planning,ﬂexible thinking, and attending objects of\ninterest, particularly if the object is associated with a reward\n29,30,33.\nHowever, much of our observed nidopallial activity occurred more\nrostrally (Fig.2, Supplementary Fig. 1 in SI) in areas associated with\nprocessing trigeminal, visual, and auditory sensory information\n34.T h e\nnidopallium was comparably less active during a crow’ss e c o n ds c a n ,\nthus this activity may have been caused by neophobic crows closely\nattending to the unfamiliar stimuli surrounding theirﬁrst experience\nwith the imaging process\n35. This observation contrasts with the ele-\nvated mesopallial activity among most of the less proﬁcient crows\nduring their second imaging experience. The mesopallial activity\nsuggests that some of this activity was caused by the birds’ cognitive\nprocessing associated with formulating a food retrieval strategy from\nthe apparatus, rather than from neophobia.\nAfter they learned to fully solve the Aesop’s fable task, high-\nproﬁciency crows showed increased activity in their cerebellum, hip-\npocampus, and nucleus basorostralis during their post-training scan\ncompared to the low-proﬁciency crows. The hippocampus is strongly\nassociated with memory\n22, as is the cerebellum36. The cerebellum is\nadditionally associated with motor learning, motor control,\nperception37,38, and tool use39. Studies examining the cerebellum in\npigeons suggest that the activity in the caudal cerebellum may be part\nof the oculomotor cerebellum\n40. With limited studies on the crow (or\nother passerine species) cerebellum, we cannot make further inter-\npretations for this region. The nucleus basorostralis receives a tri-\ngeminal projection through the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus\nand is associated with processing somatosensory information from the\nbeak\n41,42.H i g h - p r oﬁciency crows also showed increased activity within\ntheir tegmentum after they mastered the task compared to their own\nbrain activity when naïve. The tegmentum is a highly heterogenous\nregion generally involved with motor control, though it also contains\nsensory nuclei and autonomous control centers\n43.T h eo b s e r v e d\nactivity may include the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region linked\nwith the reward network and behavioral reinforcement\n44.I fs o ,t h e\nreward pathway was selectively activated in the successful crows when\nthey saw the apparatus.\nThe activity in the memory, motor, and tactile regions suggest\nthat much like the mental prep of a ski racer entering the starting gate\n– visualizing a path through the course, the location of each bump and\nobstacle, the areas to speed up or slow down– the high-proﬁciency\nbirds were preparing to enter the stimulus stage and solve the task.\nThis is reﬂected in how the groups behaviorally interacted with the\ntask in the weeks preceding their second imaging session. While the\nlow-proﬁciency birds occasionally attempted to retrieve the food\n(without interacting with the stones), they usually gave up after a few\nattempts. They retreated to the training cage for the remainder of the\ntraining session. By contrast, the high-proﬁciency crows quickly,\nTegmentum\nR\n-5.0\n-1.64\nZ\nA9.4\nL\nFDG uptake normalized to global values\nPre-Training Post-TrainingScan:\nFig. 3 | Post- versus pre-training differential brain activity for highly proﬁcient\ncrows.

This deliberate and repetitive\naction is highly conducive to memory formation and motor learning\n45.\nUnlike the consistent activity of the high- and low-proﬁciency groups,\nthe medium-proﬁciency crows showed more individual variability in\nactivity in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and nucleus basorostralis\n(Fig. 4A). This is likely because these birds varied in their interactions\nwith the task; some medium-proﬁciency birds quickly gave up their\nattempts to retrieve the food after determining it was beyond their\nreach, while others persisted in repeatedly attempting to retrieve the\nout-of-reach food. This persistence was reinforced by the occasional\nsuccess because we lowered the task difﬁculty if the crow failed to\nsolve for three consecutive sessions.\nThese ﬁndings partially support our a priori hypotheses about\nwhich regions would be more active for the varying proﬁciency\nlevels; while highly proﬁcient birds did utilize their hippocampus\nand tegmentum compared to less proﬁcient (or naïve) birds, the\npallial regions were primarily active in naïve individuals as opposed\nto proﬁcient crows. These results suggest that the high-proﬁciency\ncrows no longer needed to devote higher-order cognitive power to\nthe task because they already knew how to solve it. This change in\nrelative neural activity as the crows progressed from naïve to\nvarying degrees of tool proﬁciency resembles the differential neural\nactivity observed between novice and elite human athletes\n46,47.\nCompared to more experienced athletes, novices have greater\nactivity in the inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and\nprefrontal cortex- regions that have been likened to the avian\nnidopallium\n29. However, as the athletes become more skilled, their\nneural activity shifts away from executive function to supplemen-\ntary motor areas and the cerebellum. Evidently, highly proﬁcient\nhuman athletes and crow tool users both rely more on learned\nmotor skills instead of executive planning to overcome familiar\nchallenges in their respective areas of expertise.\nAvian brains are highly lateralized\n48, and we found differing levels\nof hemispherical bias in the active regions of this study, which are\nconsistent with previous studies using American crows and PET\nimaging\n17. We found no difference in the crows’ gaze direction (Sup-\nplementary Fig. 8 in SI), thus this hemispherical bias in activity cannot\nbe explained from asymmetrical sensory input. Low-proﬁciency birds\nshowed a left hemisphere bias in both hyperpallium apicale and MVL\nactivity, consistent with previous research demonstrating that visual\nobject processing is dominant in the left hemisphere\n48,49. Research on\ndomestic chicks shows that the right hemisphere hippocampus is\nmore sensitive to geometric spatial information\n50; our results could\ntherefore indicate that the high-proﬁciency crows mentally recalled\ntheir direction of approach and position of the apparatus when they\ninteracted with the Aesop’s task during their training in the aviary.\nPigeons with experience in long-distance navigation also show later-\nalization, with increased volume in their right hemisphere meso-\npallium and nidopallium compared to pigeons without experience\n51;\nthis bias in favor of the right hemisphere for cognitively demanding\nchallenges supports our ownﬁndings. Finally, the right hemisphere\nhas been extensively linked to novelty responses\n35, thus the right\nhemisphere bias in the mesopallial/nidopallial activity of naïve birds\nmay be due to unfamiliarity with the apparatus.\nTool use is evidently difﬁcult for captive American crows to learn;\ntask proﬁciency was not universal, some birds never progressed\nbeyond low-proﬁciency, and the individuals that ultimately mastered\nthe task required several weeks of training to learn to associate\ndropping stones into the tube’s interior with raising the water level\n(see learning curves in Supplementary Fig. 9 in SI). Yet, despite the\ndifﬁculty, some crows successfully overcame this challenge and\nR\nA15.8\nL\nCbCb\nA -1.0\nHp\nB\nA15.4\n-5.0\n-1.64\nZ\nHA\nA21.8\nMVL\nA10.6 A16.2\nM\n((A) (B) (C)\nLow HighTask Proﬁciency: Medium\nFDG uptake normalized to global values\nFig. 4 | Post-training differential brain activity for all proﬁciency groups.Top:\nCoronal view of voxel-wise subtractions (converted to Z-score maps) showing\ndifferential FDG uptake by proﬁciency during the post-training scan.

We posit that\ntheir smaller size imposes additional cognitive demands on the smaller\nfemales to compete with their male conspeciﬁcs – which can simply\nrely on their dominant status resulting from their size and strength–\nfor access to resources. For example, when many crows gather around\nan ephemeral food source, dominant birds can immediately gain\naccess to it by simply displacing smaller conspeciﬁcs, whereas the\nsmaller crows are forced to assess the situation and choose an\nappropriate strategy; if there is enough food they can patiently wait\nuntil all the larger birds become sated and depart, if they have allies\nnearby they can attempt to recruit them to collectively displace their\ncompetitors\n52, if the dominant birds become temporarily distracted\nthey can dart in to grab food, if a satellite conspeciﬁc has succeeded in\nacquiring food from the main source they can attempt to steal it, if they\nknow of another potential food source nearby they can leave in search\nof less competition, etc. The number of these potential strategies for\nsubordinate birds suggests that cognitiveﬂexibility and creativity\nmight be advantageous in subordinate birds. Three of the four high-\nproﬁciency birds had relatively high body condition upon capture\n(Table 1 in SI), suggesting that they were consistently successful in\nacquiring food despite their smaller size relative to their peers. This\nwould also explain the intermediate performance of the subadults:\nthey’re less dominant than the large adult males (thus, subjected to the\nsame pressures as the adult females), but they lack the experience of\nthe adult females. This hypothesis is further supported by other spe-\ncies with a female bias for tool use; female chimpanzees (Pan troglo-\ndytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiopssp.)\nare all smaller\n53,54 and more likely to use tools25,55 compared to their\nmale conspeciﬁcs.\nAlthough we hypothesized that the level of nervousness, body\ncondition, and relative brain volume might also play a role in inﬂuen-\nc i n gac r o w’s eventual task proﬁciency, we did not observe any\nmeaningful effect of those factors on tool proﬁciency. Our experi-\nmental design may have minimized any effect these factors may\notherwise have had on tool proﬁciency. The habituation process and\nlengthy amount of time each crow was given to interact with the task\nduring their training sessions may have allowed even the most nervous\ncrows ample opportunities to interact with the task. We calculated the\ncrows’ body condition using their weight upon capture, yet they had\nregular access to food in the days between their capture and theirﬁrst\nimaging session, which meant the crows with low body condition\nvalues had likely improved their body condition by the time they\nbegan learning the task, thus lowering their expected motivation to\nacquire food. Finally, although brain volume has been found to cor-\nrelate with the ability to solve cognitive tasks\n56, other factors such as\nneuronal count, neuronal density, relative size of speciﬁcr e g i o n s ,o r\nrelative complexity of speciﬁc circuits within the brain might have\nbeen better measures of cognitive ability10,57.\nIn conclusion, our use of American crows– an occasional tool user\nthat struggled to learn true tool use during our study despite posses-\nsing the necessary mental ability and physical adaptations– has\nrevealed crucial insights into the physical and neural attributes that\ncontribute to regular tool use by a species. Unlike the more tool-adept\nNew Caledonian crows\n12, most American crows have little need to use\ntools in their environment58. However, smaller adult females have\ncomparably more need than the larger males to creatively examine\ntheir environment for novel ways to access otherwise inaccessible food\nsources, which would account for their success at solving the Aesop’s\nfable task presented in this study. Ourﬁndings support preexisting\nevidence\n20 documenting that New Caledonian crows have enlarged\nmesopallium, striatal complex, septum, and tegmentum compared\nwith non-tool-using species, and further indicate that these brain\nregions are all important, but differentially utilized across stages of\ntool use as birds learn, practice, and master new tools in their envir-\nonment. Crows use their renowned intelligence to learn to use a tool\ninitially, but they switch to circuits associated with motor learning and\nmemory as they grow more familiar with it- a shift comparable to the\nchanges in human brain activity after mastering a skill\n46,47.T h i sﬁnding\ncould explain why so many vertebrates can master tool use indepen-\ndently after human trainers help them through the initial learning\nprocess (see\n2– 4 for examples). Broadening the application of such\nlongitudinal studies of brain activity during the learning of difﬁcult\ntasks could reveal common and unique aspects of neural networks\nacross animal taxa; even though their common ancestors diverged\nmore than 300 million years ago\n59, birds and mammals show remark-\nably similar brain activity as they learn and master cognitively difﬁcult\ntasks such as tool use.\nTable 1 | Individual variable modelselection (multinomial) for a crow’s likelihood of progressing beyond low task proﬁciency\nModel AICc Δ AICc Wi Intercept ± SE Coef ﬁcient ± SE\nAge† 29.62 0.00 0.90 Med: −1.10± 1.15\nHigh: 0.29± 0.76\nMed: 3.04± 1.57\nHigh: −8.87± 73.18\nSize 37.13 7.52 0.02 Med: 0.21 ± 12.17\nHigh: 21.62 ± 14.60\nMed: 9.61e-03 ± 0.24\nHigh: −4.50e-01 ± 0.30\nAbsolute brain volume 37.27 7.65 0.02 Med: 3.04 ± 7.56\nHigh: 18.11 ± 11.52\nMed: −0.30 ± 0.97\nHigh: −2.45 ± 1.57\nNull 37.27 7.65 0.02 Med: 6.31e-01 ± 0.61\nHigh: −3.38e-06 ± 0.71\nSex† 38.10 8.48 0.01 Med: 0.96 ± 1.22\nHigh: 1.10 ± 1.15\nMed: −1.92e-05 ± 1.41\nHigh: −2.20e00 ± 1.63\nNervousness 38.99 9.37 0.01 Med: 1.52 ± 2.21\nHigh: 3.20 ± 2.53\nMed: −0.02 ± 0.06\nHigh: −0.11 ± 0.08\nBody condition 39.46 9.84 0.01 Med: 0.80 ± 0.66\nHigh: −0.03 ± 0.79\nMed: 0.03 ± 0.04\nHigh: 0.06 ± 0.05\nBrain volume change 40.74 11.12 0.00 Med: 0.08 ± 1.37\nHigh: 2.02 ± 1.45\nMed: 11.55 ± 23.66\nHigh: −4.28 ± 26.66\nRelative brain volume 40.74 11.12 0.00 Med: 0.72 ± 0.62\nHigh: −0.01 ± 0.73\nMed: −0.51 ± 1.23\nHigh: −1.10 ± 1.56\nThe model for age failed to converge properly because there were 0 instances of a subadult mastering the task.

Due to potential differences in behavior and\ncognitive development, we immediately released birds in theirﬁrst\nyear of life. We caught two cohorts of birds outside of the breeding\nseason and held each for several months (n = 8 from October 2017 to\nFebruary 2018, andn = 8 from September 2018 to February 2019).\nWe kept crows in a protected outdoor aviary at the University of\nWashington, Seattle. The crows were individually housed in adjacent\ncages (measuring 1.8 × 2.1 × 2.4 m; hereafter aviary cage) separated\nby wire mesh; crows could see and hear their neighbors but could\nnot leave their cage. We provided crows with a rotating diet of\nassorted meats, eggs, grain, fruit, and dried dog kibble ad libitum for\nseveral hours each day.\nAesop’s fable task apparatus\nWe constructed the Aesop’s task apparatuses using clear plastic acrylic\ntubes with an internal diameter of 5.1 cm mounted to the center of a\n(15.2 × 20.3 × 0.6 cm) polycarbonate sheet. We used cheese puffs as the\nfood reward because theyﬂoat on water for >3 h, possess a bright\norange color that is easily seen, and are preferred by crows. We used\nplastic aquarium stones as the task’s tools; they were relatively light\n(thus easy for a crow to lift), colored green or blue (increasing their\ncontrast with the white arena), and, when dropped, each stone dis-\nplaced water within the tube by 5– 9m m .\nHabituation/learning the Aesop’s fable task\nTo reduce the neurological activity associated with the novelty of the\nprocedure itself, we regularly (every 1– 2 days) habituated crows to\nthe unfamiliar conditions they would experience during the imaging\nprocess (Fig. 1B). All crows experienced >7 habituation sessions\n(mean ± SD: 10.2 ± 4.5 days) before theirﬁrst scan.\nWe simulated the radiotracer injection by removing crows from\ntheir aviary cage, covering their heads with a cloth, laying them on\ntheir back, spraying their belly with water (to mimic the alcohol used as\nan antiseptic), and lightly pinching the injection site for several sec-\nonds. After the simulated radiotracer injection, we replicated the sti-\nmulus phase of the imaging process by moving the crow to a secluded\narea away from the main aviary and placing it inside a smaller cage\n(1 × 0.5 × 0.5 m; hereafter training cage), before moving a hollow\nwooden arena of identical size (hereafter the training arena) in front of\nthe training cage. We placed the training arena directly adjacent to\n(and ﬂush with) the front of the training cage and covered the cage’s\nwalls so that the crow’s only external view was the interior of the arena.\nWe painted the arena white and kept its interior well-lit by a ceiling-\nmounted LED light source (whereas the cage’s interior was relatively\ndark due to the wall coverings) to further mimic the stimulus phase of\nimaging experiments. During the pre-scan habituation process, we\nkept the training arena’s interior empty and prevented crows from\nleaving the training cage by keeping the cage door closed. We habi-\ntuated crows before receiving their daily food to replicate the time\nafter the last eating they would experience before the scan. After 2– 3h\nin the training cage, we returned the crows to their aviary cages and\nfed them.\nAfter they were exposed to an Aesop’st a s kd u r i n gt h e i rﬁrst\nimaging session, we began the training phase (Fig.1D). We continued\nto simulate the radiotracer injection before placing crows inside the\ntraining cage. However, we now allowed crows to enter the training\narena and interact with an Aesop’s fable apparatus. As before, we did\nnot feed crows before training, ensuring they were motivated to\nretrieve the food reward. We returned crows to their aviary cage and\nfed them after 2– 3 h or after they retrieved the food reward, whichever\noccurred ﬁrst. We remotely tracked their progress using peephole\nviewers mounted to the training arena and recorded all training trials\nusing a video camera placed inside the training arena.\nWe incrementally trained crows to solve the Aesop’s fable task. We\nstarted by leaving 2– 3 cheese puffs on the ground of the training arena\nto entice crows to enter the arena. After a crow began retrieving food\nfrom the arenaﬂoor, we added a baited Aesop’s task apparatus with\nwaterﬁlled to the brim and multiple stones along the tube’sb a s e .E a c h\ntime a crow successfully retrieved food from the tube, we decreased\nthe water level until we had established the maximum reachable depth\nfor that crow. We then lowered the water depth to 5 mm below the\ncrow’s maximum reachable distance and attached training stones to\nlines emanating from inside the tube (Fig.1iv). We balanced the\ntraining stones on the tube’s rim so that as crows attempted to reach\nthe food, they usually dropped one or more into the tube, bringing the\nwater level andﬂoating cheese puff up to a reachable distance. We next\nbegan increasing the length of the training stone lines, lowering the\ntraining stones along the tube exterior, forcing the crow to either lift\nAdult crows only (n=8) \n((A)\n(B)\n(C)\n(D)\nAge\nAdult\nSubadult\nAll crows (n=16) \n# Crows\nTask Proﬁciency\nAbsolute Brain Volume (cm3)# Crows\nSex\nFemale\nMale\nCulmen Length (mm)\nSolved the Task\nFig. 5 | Individual factors and task proﬁciency.

Finally, we\nremoved the training stones so that the crow was forced to pick stones\noff the ground and drop them into the tube before retrieving the food\n(Fig. 1vi); we considered any crow that did so to have mastered the\ntask. If any crows failed to solve for 3 consecutive sessions, we reduced\nthe difﬁculty by raising the water level or position of the training\nstones.\nWe continued to train each crow until they received their 2nd\nimaging session, which was logistically dictated by the availability of\nthe PET scanner. The 2017 cohort of birds received a balanced number\nof training days (mean ± SD: 51.4 ± 0.5 days) because we were able to\ncomplete all birds’post-training scans within 15 days. However, we had\nlimited access to the PET scanner for the 2018 cohort (45 days separ-\natingﬁrst and last post-training scans), which resulted in more variable\ntraining time for that group (53.8 ± 13.6 days). Because of this, we\npreferentially selected individuals that had stopped engaging with the\napparatus for the earlier post-training scans to give additional training\ntime to the birds that were still actively interacting. This variation in\ntraining time did not cause any signiﬁcant differences in task proﬁ-\nciency between the two cohorts (X\n2(2df, N =1 6 )=1 . 5 ,P = 0.47).\nWe assigned crows into one of three proﬁciency categories for\nanalysis. Low-proﬁciency crows never dropped any training stones into\nthe tube, medium-proﬁciency crows occasionally dropped training\nstones while they were balanced on the tube lip (Fig.1iv), and high-\nproﬁciency crows fully mastered the task by collecting stones from the\nground and dropping them inside the tube. Variations within these\ncategories can be found in Supplementary Tables 1 and 3 in the SI. The\ncrows quickly progressed through the initial proﬁciency levels, with\nthe low- and medium-proﬁciency birds reaching their maximum pro-\nﬁciency in 7.0 ± 3.7 days and 17 ± 10.5 days, respectively. However, it\ntook much longer (48.0 ± 9.8 days) for the high-proﬁciency crows to\nbegin deliberately dropping hanging training stones (Fig.1v) into the\napparatus, though they rapidly progressed from there to picking up\nstones from the ground and dropping them into the tube (3.0 ± 1.0\nadditional days). See Supplementary Fig. 9 in SI for each crow’s\nlearning curve.\nNote that crows are social animals that are capable of social\nlearning, thus teaching the crows to solve the task in isolation may not\nhave been the most conducive way to train crows. However, previous\nresearch has shown that crows do not easily learn to solve tasks using\nsocial learning, although they will use it to reﬁne their technique\n60.\nIndividual measures\nTo correlate individual physical characteristics with task proﬁciency,\nwe measured and compared the following attributes from each bird:\nage, body condition, culmen length, level of nervousness, sex, brain\nvolume (both absolute and relative to body size), and change in brain\nvolume between the pre- and post-training scans. For age, we\ncategorized birds as being in their second year of life (subadult) or\nolder (adult) using a combination of plumage color (dark brown/dull\nblack for subadults, glossy black for adults), mouth coloration (traces\nof pink for subadults, fully black for adults), and feather wear (uni-\nformly worn for subadults, mostly new for adults)\n61. We calculated the\ncrows’body condition by extracting the residuals from a regression of\ntheir body weight upon capture against their culmen length (mm from\nt h ed i s t a lt i po ft h eb i l lt ot h eb a s eo ft h ef e a t h e r s ) .W ed e t e r m i n e d\neach bird’s level of nervousness by standing 2 m away from each bird’s\ncage while staring at aﬁxed point within the cage (not at the crow) and\ncounting the bird’s movements for 60 s. We assigned a numerical value\nbased on the bird’s perceived urgency to each move; walking along the\nperch = 0.5 orﬂying/hopping to another perch = 1. We obtained two\nsuch measurements for each bird (theﬁrst within two weeks of cap-\nture, the second within two weeks of release) and averaged them. We\nsexed our birds using a QIAGEN® DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit to isolate\ngenomic DNA from each blood sample, amplifying the target genes\n(CHD1-W and CHD1-Z) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and\nconducting agarose gel electrophoresis on the PCR product to reveal\nsex differences\n62.\nWe calculated brain volume u sing an open-source DICOM\nviewer Horos version 3.2.1 (The Horos Project, sponsored by Nimble Co\nLLC d/b/a Purview, Annapolis, MD, USA) to analyze the CT images\nobtained during the birds’ ﬁrst imaging session. We conducted brain\nsegmentation on approximately 50%of the relevant slices using Horos’s\nthreshold-based 2D region of interest (ROI) utility, though we avoided\nthe regions (cerebellum and brainstem) caudal to the nidopallium\ncaudale; we edited these ROIs by hand before the software added\ninterpolated ROIs on the missing slices. We inspected all generated\nROI’s before calculating theﬁnal brain volume (cm\n3) with the built-in\nutility. Because some of the brain segmentation was performed manu-\nally (and thus subject to user bias), multiple researchers independently\nanalyzed several of the same CTs; because ourﬁndings differed by a\nvery small amount (0.82% ± 0.62%,n = 11), we discounted user bias as\nminimal. To account for the allometric association of brain volume to\nbody size, we extracted the residuals from a regression of brain volume\nand culmen length and used these residuals as a measure of relative\nb r a i nv o l u m ed u r i n ga n a l y s i si na d d i t i o nt or a wa b s o l u t eb r a i nv o l u m e .\nFinally, we discovered that the crow’s brain volumes were signiﬁcantly\nsmaller during their post-training scan (mean ± sd = 7.15 ± 0.63 cm\n3)\nthan they were during their pre -training scan (7.56 ± 0.68 cm3,\nt(15) = 7.39,p < 0.001), so we included the % reduction in volume\nbetween the two scans as aﬁnal individual measure against task proﬁ-\nciency (see Supplementary Table 1 in SI). An analysis is underway to\ninvestigate the reasons for the change in brain volume.\nBrain imaging\nWe imaged up to three crows per day, using a Siemens Inveon PET/CT\nsystem. We acquired usable imaging data from 14 of the 16 crows, with\nTable 2 | Individual variable model selection (binomial) for an adult crow’s likelihood of fully mastering the task\nModel AICc Δ AICc Wi Intercept ± SE Coef ﬁcient ± SE P\nAbsolute brain volume 11.22 0 0.29 76.32 ± 95.71 −10.22± 12.79 0.42\nSex† 11.4 0.18 0.27 19.57 ± 6208.83 −20.95± 6208.83 0.99\nSize 11.5 0.28 0.25 46.97 ± 39.73 −0.95± 0.78 0.23\nNull 13.76 2.54 0.08 7.85e-17 ± 7.07e-01 1\nBody condition 15.13 3.91 0.04 −0.11 ± 0.83 0.10 ± 0.08 0.20\nNervousness 15.78 4.56 0.03 3.22 ± 2.83 −0.11 ± 0.09 0.25\nBrain volume change 16.84 5.62 0.02 1.11 ± 1.61 −20.54 ± 26.19 0.43\nRelative brain volume 17.11 5.89 0.02 −0.03 ± 0.73 −0.97 ± 1.62 0.55\nThe model for sex failed to converge properly because there were 0 instances of a female failing to master the task.

The scanning process consisted of\na 20 min microPET scan, followed by a CT scan in the docked and\ncoregistered microCT scanner. The scanners share a multimodality\nbed and have a bore diameter of ~12 cm. The PETﬁeld of view was\napproximately 8 × 13 cm\n2 while the CTﬁeld of view was 7.9 cm × 13.3\ncm; both included the entire brain with a slice thickness of approxi-\nmately 0.1 mm. The scanner bed contained a pressure pad, which we\nused to monitor the crow’s breathing (and thus the depth of anes-\nthesia) during the scan process.\nThe evening before a bird was scanned (typically 1600– 1700), we\nremoved it from its aviary cage, placed it in a small animal carrier, and\ncarried it across campus to the imaging laboratory, where we trans-\nferred it to a small wire cage with identical dimensions as the training\ncage (1 × 0.5 × 0.5 m; hereafter referred to as imaging cage) in a sepa-\nrate holding room to acclimate overnight. The imaging cage contained\nwater but not food, ensuring crows fasted for at least 14 h before\nimaging to control for variable blood glucose levels inﬂuencing FDG\nuptake. The holding room’sl i g h t sw e r es e tt of o l l o wa1 2 - h o u rd a y /\nnight timer so the ambient light did not disrupt the crows’sleep cycle,\nand two sets of doors separated the holding room from the scanning\nroom, ensuring the birds received minimal disturbance from the\nscanner or personnel.\nThe following morning, twenty minutes before the experiment,\nwe covered the crow’s imaging cage with a blanket (preventing it from\nlooking out) and moved it into the scanning room to acclimate to the\nambient noise of the room. To administer the radiotracer, we reached\nunder the covering into the cage, grabbed the crow, covered its head\nwith a cloth to calm it, placed it on its back, sprayed its belly with a\ndisinfectant, and administered an intraperitoneal injection of\napproximately 1 mCi of [18 F] Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) (exact\nvolume adjusted to account for radioactive decay and the bird’s\nweight, ranging from 0.05 to 0.10 mL). After injection, we returned the\ncrow to its covered cage and removed the cloth covering its head.\nWe presented the experimental stimuli within a wooden stage\n(1.2 × 0.6 × 0.45 m; hereafter the stimulus stage), the purpose of which\nwas to block the crow’s view of the imaging laboratory/personnel\n(thereby removing potential confounding sources of distraction) and\nto standardize the background color, light intensity, and light angle\nbetween trials. The stimulus stage was painted white to meet facility\nregulations for disinfecting porous surfaces and contained a ceiling-\nmounted LED light source directly above the stimulus. The front of the\nstimulus stage had two overlapping sliding panels, which we used to\nreveal or hide the stage interior; in addition to blocking the crow’s view\nof the stimulus, the panels also blocked nearly all the light from the\ninternal LED, increasing the contrast between showing and hiding the\nstimulus. The panels opened from the center of the crow’sv i e wo ft h e\nstage so that the crow’s eyes received equal stimulation, thus ensuring\nour methodology was not responsible for any bilateral differences in\nactivation between the two brain hemispheres.\nDuring the 3 min immediately after injecting the radiotracer, we\npositioned the stimulus stage in front of (and adjacent to) the covered\nimaging cage and removed the blanket from the cage side facing the\nstage; the crow remained in relative darkness because the remaining\nblanket blocked all exterior view of the lab while the stimulus stage’s\nclosed sliding panels prevented the crow from seeing the illuminated\nstage interior. At 3 min post-injection, we opened the sliding panels to\nreveal the experimental stimulus: a baited Aesop tube task with water\nlevel 12 cm from the top accompanied by seven stones. For the fol-\nlowing 10 min (hereafter the stimulus phase), we used the sliding doors\nto alternatively reveal the stimulus to the crow for 60 s, then hide it for\n30 s (seven exposures and six associated breaks total). After theﬁnal\nexposure ended at 13 min post-injection, we again removed the crow\nfrom the cage, covered its head with a cloth, and anesthetized it via a\ncustom nose cone with 5% isoﬂu r a n ei no x y g e nw i t haﬂow rate of\n300– 800 mL/min before placing it in the scanner (we reduced iso-\nﬂurane concentration to 2.5– 3% after the crow was fully induced).\nWe used Velcro straps to secure the anesthetized crow to the\nmultimodality bed before starting the scanning process 26 min post-\ninjection. The multimodality bed contained a pressure pad, which we\nused to monitor the crow’s breathing (and thus the depth of anesthesia)\nduring the scan process. After the scan was complete, we secured the\ncrow in hand until it fully emerged from anesthesia (indicated when it\nregained the ability to grip with both feet), before returning it and the\nimaging cage to the holding room. We kept the scanned crows in the\nholding room for 20 h (the time required for 18 F radioactivity to decay\nto acceptable levels), after which we returned them to the aviary.\nStimulus phase behavior\nWe observed the crows’ behavior while they were metabolizing the\nFDG radiotracer and attending to the Aesop apparatus stimulus\nduring the scanning process (see Supplementary Methods in the SI\nfor details). The crows visually attended to the Aesop’s fable task\nwhenever it was revealed, gazing into the stimulus stage for much of\nthe time (left eye: mean ± SD; 383.2 ± 37.5 s; right eye: 368.7 ± 49.6 s)\nthat it was visible to them (420 s) without favoring one eye over the\nother (t\n24 = 1.45,P = 0.16) and with no signiﬁcant difference in gaze\ntime between the two scans (left eye:t23 = 0.44,P = 0.66; right eye:\nt23 = 0.33, P = 0.74). Their mean blink rate remained steady\n(23.38 ± 8.12 blinks/min) and did not change between scans\n(t23 = 0.30,P = 0.77). Although a single outlier individual from the\nlow-proﬁciency group paced constantly and moved more thanﬁve\ntimes the amount of any other crow (398 movements), the remaining\nbirds moved substantially less often during the stimulus phase\n(without outlier: 21.73 ± 22.78 movements, min = 0, max = 75). See SI\nfor details on how we recorded the crows’ behavior during the sti-\nmulus phase and Supplementary Fig. 8 in SI for behavioral changes\nbetween scans and proﬁciencies.\nImage processing\nAfter we imaged each crow, we conducted a 13 min attenuation scan,\nthen reconstructed the image using the vendor-supplied (i.e., Siemens\nInveon) 3D OSEM/MAP algorithm with two 3D OSEM iterations fol-\nlowed by 18 MAP iterations and a target isotropic spatial resolution of\n2.5 mm full width at half maximum, with attenuation and scatter cor-\nrections applied to the data. We imported the raw DICOM data to\nImageJ\n63, manually aligned their orientation to match an established\njungle crow (Corvus macrorhynchos) brain atlas64 that was adapted for\nPET16, and trimmed the images to include only the brain. We stereo-\ntactically aligned the scans by estimating and applying nine afﬁne\nparameters to the images using NEUROSTAT65, an algorithm originally\ndesigned for automated human brain analysis which we adapted for\ncrow brains analysis. The stereotactic alignment also corrected for\ndifferences in brain volume. We estimated alignment precision to be\none-two pixels. We normalized all uptake values to a global brain FDG\nuptake. We used a jungle crow atlas\n64 and a carrion crow (Corvus cor-\none)a t l a s66, adjusted by the differences in species brain size and the\nshape of whole versus extracted brains67, as guides to identify the\nregions signiﬁcantly activated by each stimulus.\nStatistical analysis\nWe conducted all statistical tests using R version 3.6.368.W ec o m -\npared stimulus phase behaviors (blink rate, gaze, and movement)\nbetween scans using a Student’s t-test and between proﬁciency\ngroups using a linear model. We correlated FDG uptake with blink\nrate and movement using a Pearson correlation test. To determine\nwhich (if any) of the eight individual factors were associated with a\ncrow’s proﬁciency at solving the task, we constructed multinomial\nmodels using R package plyr\n69 for every individual variable (along\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42203-8\nNature Communications|         (2023) 14:6539 9\nwith an accompanying null model) and used AICc to determine which\nmodel was most supported by the data. We considered models to be\ncompetitive if they were within 2 AICc of the model with the lowest\nAICc. Because the high-proﬁciency birds were exclusively adults, we\nconducted a second model selection among them with a binomial\nresponse “did/did not reach high-proﬁciency” using generalized lin-\near models (family = binomial). Both models used a logit link.\nBecause many variables were correlated with each other (such as sex\nand culmen length)\n27, we report the Pearson’s r between variables.\nBecause the crows’ brains unexpectedly decreased in volume in\nthe time interval between their pre- and post-training scans, we treated\nthe two scans as independent for the voxelwise statistical comparison,\ndespite having come from the same bird. We determined signiﬁcant\ndifferences in regional activity using NEUROSTAT\n65.T h i sa l g o r i t h m\nconducts aZ-test comparing the study population’s globally normal-\nized difference in FDG uptake between theﬁrst (control) and second\n(stimulus) scans against the study population’s pooled variance; it\ndoes this for each voxel coordinate throughout the entire brain using a\nmodiﬁed Bonferroni correction with a smoothing factor. We only\nreport the activity with aZ-score greater than 4.0 to reduce type I\nerrors and to be consistent with previous imaging studies\n16– 19.W ea l s o\nreport changes in activity with aZ-score between 3.7– 4.0 if the extent\nof activity is consistent with the size/location of a known brain region,\nas this may be worth examining in greater detail in future studies. As an\nadditional veriﬁcation of the voxelwise results, we ran an independent\nanalysis, which sampled all the image sets from all subjects using\nspherical volumes of interest (VOIs; 2-voxel radius) centered around\nthe signiﬁcant peak coordinates. We plotted these VOI uptake values as\na distribution to determine if said results are driven by outlying\nindividual scans.\nEthical Note\nWe captured, housed, and tested all crows (including PET/CT scans) in\naccordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of\nthe University of Washington (IACUC; protocol number 3077-01),\nFederal Collecting Permit MB761139-0, and State of Washington Sci-\nentiﬁc Collection Permit 14-010.
