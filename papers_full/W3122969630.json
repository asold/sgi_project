    "abstract": "Abstract Power transformer fault diagnosis exerts a vital part in the safe operation of power system. The PSO-SVM based on transformer fault diagnosis still has some shortcomings, such as slow convergence speed and easy to fall into local optimization. This dissertation proposes a transformer diagnosis method based on Improve Particle Swarm Optimization to support Vector Machine (MPSO-SVM). Adding disturbance to Particle swarm optimization (PSO) to disturb the position of such precocious particles, so as to get rid of local optimum. The case analysis represents that the diagnostic accuracy of MPSO-SVM is higher than that of PSO-SVM and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and MPSO-SVM can effectively promote the fault diagnosis performance of transformer.",
