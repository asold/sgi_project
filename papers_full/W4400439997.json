    "abstract": "The widespread availability of large language models (LLMs) has presented the opportunity for novice programmers to make use of them for the purpose of understanding and synthesising code. In this paper, we discuss a small pilot study intended to explore the user experience of doing so in a limited way, and the attitudes of a group of novice programmers towards this style of programming. We also draw parallels to the seminal work of Lisanne Bainbridge, and discuss the way in which her \"ironies of automation\" are also present when attempting to automate the activity of programming.",
