    "abstract": "We describe our approach to grammatical er-ror correction presented in the CoNLL Shared Task 2014. Our work is focused on error detec-tion in sentences with a language model based on syntactic tri-grams and bi-grams extracted from dependency trees generated from 90 % of the English Wikipedia. Also, we add a naïve module to error correction that outputs a set of possible answers, those sentences are scored using a syntactic n-gram language model. The sentence with the best score is the final sug-gestion of the system. The system was ranked 11th, evidently this is a very simple approach, but since the begin-ning our main goal was to test the syntactic n-gram language model with a big corpus to future comparison. 1",
