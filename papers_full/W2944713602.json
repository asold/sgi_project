  "abstract": "Abstract The article is devoted to the physical nature of geomagnetism, magnetic storms and methods of predicting their origin and deals with geomagnetic induced currents called GIC (Geomagnetically Induced Currents) and their effect on power transformers. A simplified, single-phase transmission system is described mathematically and its analysis was performed. Also the phenomenon of periodic semi-saturation of the magnetic circuit of the transformers resulting in current overload of the transformer windings, which can lead to thermal damage of the windings is explained. In addition, there is a significant deformation of the currents in the electrical system. The numerical solution of the system was verified by measurement on an electrical model.",
