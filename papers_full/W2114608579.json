In low and middle income countries\nwhere capacity and administrative problems with the col-\nlection of health data are common, surveys are often the\nonly way to collect reliable data [1,2]. Paper based data\ncollection has been the standard method for decades but\nerrors are frequent, storage costs are prohibitive, and the\ncosts of double data entry are high. Electronic methods of\ndata collection have been developed in order to merge the\nprocess of data collection and data entry [2]. Handheld\ndevices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) are\nincreasingly being used instead of paper and pencil meth-\nods of data collection [1,3]. PDAs are not without prob-\nlems of their own, however, including the challenges\nassociated with having to download data (often to expen-\nPublished: 23 December 2009\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2009, 9:51 doi:10.1186/1472-6947-9-51\nReceived: 11 June 2009\nAccepted: 23 December 2009\nThis article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/9/51\n© 2009 Tomlinson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2009, 9:51 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/9/51\nPage 2 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nsive laptops in the field). In addition, data can be cor-\nrupted if PDAs are damaged, or data can be lost if PDAs\nare misplaced or stolen.\nWireless and mobile phone technologies have the poten-\ntial to overcome some of these limitations. Moreover, they\ncan be adapted for use in field research settings. Low and\nmiddle-income countries lack the infrastructure in many\nresearch field settings to accommodate adequate fixed line\ninternet access, whereas wireless networks allow access to\ntelecommunications in a region where fixed lines remain\nlimited. In Africa, mobile users account for 83 per cent of\ntelephone subscribers, a higher proportion than any other\nregion in the world [4]. South Africa leads the continent\nin mobile penetration with 36.4 mobile phones per 100\npopulation [5]. Use of mobile phones is widespread even\nin remote areas of rural South Africa [6].\nThe use of mobile technology as a research instrument is\nin its infancy, however. Studies conducted in developed\ncountry settings have investigated the use of cell phones\non the patient end to generate feedback for improved\nchronic illness care and monitoring [7-9], increased med-\nication compliance [10] and smoking cessation [11], or\nreduced missed clinic visits [12,13]. Additionally, other\nstudies have investigated the use of cell phones on the\nprovider end to transmit images for documentation [14]\nor diagnostic purposes [15-18]. However, few studies\nhave investigated the use of mobile phones as a data col-\nlection tool in low income countries. One demonstration\nproject in Peru showed that a cell phone-based system\ncould be used to collect real-time data on adverse events\noccurring during the course of a randomized trial [19].\nThe Millennium Villages Project has also begun efforts to\nuse mobile phones to monitor livestock health, facilitate\nthe timely transfer of patients to appropriate health facili-\nties, and support community health workers in the field\n[20]. Finally, there are numerous anecdotal reports [21],\nbut few published studies exist.\nIn the context of poor research infrastructure and of\nincreasing demands for large scale health surveys, the\naffordability and availability of mobile phones and wire-\nless networks make them a viable alternative to traditional\npaper and pencil methods and even PDAs. In this paper\nwe report on the use of mobile phones in a survey con-\nducted in a peri-urban settlement in South Africa using lay\ncommunity health workers. The aim of this survey was to\nlist and map households, and to collect selected socio-\ndemographic data of household members. We investi-\ngated the feasibility, the ease of implementation, and the\nextent to which community health workers with little\nexperience in electronic data collection could be trained\nand successfully supervised to collect data using mobile\nphones in a large health survey.\nMethods\nSetting\nThe site for the survey was Umlazi, a peri-urban settle-\nment close to Durban in South Africa. Umlazi has a mix-\nture of formal and informal housing. It is a relatively well\nresourced peri-urban area but with a non-optimally func-\ntioning health system. The infant mortality rate is around\n60 per 1,000 live births [22], and, while there is no relia-\nble figure of the neonatal mortality rate (NMR), most esti-\nmates place the NMR at about 25 per 1,000 live births.\nThe HIV prevalence amongst antenatal clients in South\nAfrica is 44% [22]. In order to check the homogeneity of\nclusters in preparation for a planned cluster randomized\ntrial we conducted a baseline survey.\nData collection and training\nThe data were collected by local women hired as commu-\nnity health workers (CHW's). Twenty-four clusters cover-\ning the proposed study area were selected prior to survey\nimplementation. Every house in all 24 clusters was listed\nusing the South African national census listing strategy\n[23]. The senior member of each household in each clus-\nter was interviewed. All interviews were conducted face-to-\nface, in the homes of the study participants.\nNone of the 24 CHW's had any previous experience of\ndata collection, but all had personal mobile phones and\nwere proficient in the use of short message service (SMS)\nmessaging. Training for the data collection protocol was\nconducted for all the CHW's over a two day period with\nthe data quality control officer present. Training consisted\nof a general orientation to using the phone and its data\ncollection software, accessing the questionnaires on the\nphone, and standard care of the device. The training also\nincluded information on troubleshooting and how to\ndeal with technical difficulties that might arise with the\nmobile phones. Survey questions were pilot tested prior to\nimplementation to ensure readability and to ensure that\nthe questions were understandable to respondents. Stand-\nard interview protocols were used to direct how interviews\nwere conducted, and standard operating procedures were\ndeveloped.\nMobile Researcher: the mobile phone data collection \nsystem\nImplementation of the mobile system (\"Mobile\nResearcher\") was a partnership between the Health Sys-\ntems Research Unit at the Medical Research Council of\nSouth Africa and a private digital solutions company,\nClyral. The only hardware requirement for Mobile\nResearcher is that the mobile phone must be enabled for\nthe Java programming language. The software consists of\na Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) client which is installed on\nparticipating project staff handsets and communicates\nwith the Mobile Researcher web application, also devel-\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2009, 9:51 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/9/51\nPage 3 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\noped on the ASP .NET 3.5 framework. Java's core code is\navailable under open-source distribution terms. We estab-\nlished a web-based system that allowed electronic surveys\nor questionnaires to be designed on a word processor,\nsent wirelessly to standard entry level mobile phones, and\nthen used in interviews. Survey completion takes place\noffline, and no network coverage is necessary.\nCompleted surveys are automatically uploaded to the\nhost computer. If there is no mobile network coverage,\ncompleted surveys are stored securely until a signal is\nfound at which time completed surveys are uploaded.\nEntry level mobile phones can store approximately 50\ncompleted standard-length surveys. Mobile Researcher\ncan incorporate multiple choice, free text, numeric, date,\ntime and other question types (see Figure 1).\nIn addition, Mobile Researcher can also accommodate\nbranching and skip logic as well as enforced validation in\nthe field (Figure 2). Survey data are uploaded using low\ncost general packet radio service (GPRS). A web-based\ninterface was developed to facilitate the review and\nexporting of results in standard file formats such as\ncomma separated values (CSV) and Microsoft Excel. Fig-\nure 3 is an illustration of an Excel report that provides for-\nmatted information files on data collector, time taken for\nthe participant id and household code and when the\nactual upload of the data took place. Outputs such as this\n(Figure 3) can be generated as often as the investigator\nwould like. Alternatively, built-in graphs and reports on\nthe web-based interface permit real-time visualization of\nsurvey responses. Supervisors can communicate with data\ncollectors directly, either through a call to the mobile\nphone or through SMS messaging. For logistic and super-\nvisory purposes SMS messages can be sent through the\nweb-interface to one or more data collectors at the same\ntime.\nAll survey data were encrypted, thus maintaining the con-\nfidentiality of responses. Communication between the\nbrowser and the server was encrypted using 128-bit SSL.\nSystem servers were secured by firewalls to prevent unau-\nthorised access and denial of service attacks, while data\nwas protected from virus threats using NOD32 anti-virus\ntechnology. Access to the web-interface is protected by\npasswords. In the current study, access to the data was\nrestricted to the principal investigator, the project man-\nager, data quality officer and web administrator.\nScreen shots of survey on the mobile phoneFigure 1\nScreen shots of survey on the mobile phone.\n\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2009, 9:51 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/9/51\nPage 4 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nResults\nImplementation of the Survey\nOver the course of four months, 39,665 households were\nsurveyed with no data loss. Quality checks were per-\nformed in real-time, and inconsistencies were detected,\nrectified, and cleaned in a timely manner. There were no\nhardware or software failures using the mobile phones.\nThe automated graphs and reports allowed the project\nmanager to visualize outputs such as survey completion\ncount on an hourly or daily basis or the average survey\ncompletion time.\nThe mobile phone, together with the web-interface,\nallowed the project manager to monitor work rate, attend-\nance (given that this was a community based survey),\ncommencement of work, and cessation of work (see Fig-\nure 4). The automatic uploading of completed surveys\nprovided ongoing data on interview start time, end time,\nand time taken to complete each survey (Figure 4). Regu-\nlar meetings were held with Clyral to review the data col-\nlection process and address any difficulties.\nOne of the major advantages of the mobile phone data\ncollection method was in the real-time detection of prob-\nable data falsification. Based on our experience with the\nCHW training sessions, and the short survey we expected\nthat negotiating entry into the house, completion of the\nsurvey and the walk to the next house would require a\ntotal of 25 minutes. Using the web-based interface and the\nreal-time monitoring of CHW output, we were able to\ndetect an instance of data fabrication on the day that it\noccurred (see Figure 3 and Figure 4 for the data that is\navailable to produce this information). Using this data,\nwe observed that one CHW was submitting completed\nsurveys every five to ten minutes. This was thought to be\nan impossibly short time given our expectations about the\namount of time it would reasonably take to move from\nhousehold to household, introduce the study, obtain\ninformed consent, and complete the survey. The principal\ninvestigator was contacted, and a brief meeting was held\nwith the CHW and it was established that she was com-\npleting surveys while sitting at home. Without revealing\nthe identity of the CHW responsible, we also informed the\nrest of the CHW's about the incident in order to establish\nawareness among the staff of the monitoring potential of\nthe supervision system. This was the only instance of data\nfabrication that we discovered. Rapid detection of fabri-\ncated data based on paper and pencil surveys can be diffi-\ncult. For field research arrangements that involve weekly\nor monthly supervisory meetings, correction of the data\nfabrication may not occur until weeks to months after the\nfabrication has begun.\nCost of Implementation\nGiven the minimal hardware requirements, we selected an\nentry level mobile phone (NOKIA 2626), which was\npriced at ZAR400 (US$40) in South Africa at the time of\nthe survey. Surveys were billed per individual question\ncompleted. In this survey, the cost per completed survey\nwas US $0.30 (with no data storage or data entry costs).\nDiscussion\nIn a household survey, using previously untrained CHW's\nas data collectors, we utilized mobile phones to enter and\nupload data at the point of collection. The software appli-\ncation and web-based interface enhanced real-time super-\nvision of data collectors. We were able to implement this\nsurvey with low direct costs of materials. While we are not\nable to compare costs to a paper based approach in this\nstudy, it is likely that a cost of $0.30 per survey compares\nfavorably. Were we using a paper based approach this fig-\nure would include paper costs, printing costs as well as\ndata entry costs. The issue of the cost effectiveness of the\nsystem needs to be explored in further research that\nEnforced validationFigure 2\nEnforced validation.\n\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2009, 9:51 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/9/51\nPage 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nemploys a comparison group. Overall, our findings dem-\nonstrate that mobile phone based data collection is feasi-\nble at scale.\nReal-time supervision of CHW performance was a signifi-\ncant advance over previous implementation work. It has\nbeen argued that pen and paper are prone to fabrication\n[21]. Our web-based interface permitted a previously\nimpractical degree of detailed, hour-by-hour supervision,\nwhich markedly improved our ability to detect one type of\ndata fabrication. Other types of data fabrication could still\ngo undetected; for example, a data collector could key in\nrandom answers on a timed basis, and our supervisors\nwould be unable to detect this activity. Such fabrication\ncould only be detected and eliminated with the use of a\nmore expensive mobile phone with GPS capabilities that\nwould enable supervisors to track CHW movements. The\nweb-based interface had other advantages as well. The\nautomated graphs and real-time information allowed\nsupervisors to focus their time on other aspects of quality\ncontrol and solving logistical difficulties in the field.\nWith regards to the direct costs of materials, the auto-\nmated uploading of completed surveys obviated the step\nof having to transfer data in the field from a PDA to a lap-\ntop. This is a significant cost saving, as laptops are often\nthe most expensive up front cost in studies using PDAs for\ndata collection [2]. In addition, the web-based interface\npermitted us to monitoring the costs of uploading survey\ndata in real time.\nAutomated data upload from the mobile phone to the\nserver significantly reduces data loss due to PDA damage,\ntheft or loss because of the time elapsed between data col-\nlection and data upload. Prior studies have reported tech-\nnical problems with data upload and download using\nPDA-based survey systems [24], as well as difficulties in\nremote sites with data upload due to electrical interference\nwith telephone lines and switchboard difficulties [1]. In\naddition, there have been considerable problems noted\nwith the instability of the \"active synchronization\" proc-\ness when transferring data from PDA to computer [25]. In\nour study, there was no data loss. While this does not\nGenerated spreadsheetFigure 3\nGenerated spreadsheet.\n\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2009, 9:51 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/9/51\nPage 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nguarantee that data loss cannot occur with this system, we\nbelieve the chances of data loss were significantly mini-\nmized.\nOur mobile phone based survey apparatus may be partic-\nularly suited for conducting survey research in rural areas.\nIn surveys where multiple research sites may be remote\nand dispersed, and where vehicles have to be used to\ntravel from site to site to download data onto laptops, the\nmobile phone based data collection system may be a sig-\nnificantly cheaper option. Importantly, survey storage (up\nto 50 completed surveys can be stored on an entry-level\nmobile phone) and delayed upload permits surveys to be\nconducted in areas where there is no mobile phone cover-\nage.\nMobile phone based surveys have other advantages and\ndisadvantages that may be particularly important to\nresearchers depending on their needs and the study set-\nting. The automatic uploading of surveys and encrypted\naccess to the web-based interface contributes to improved\ndata security and respondent confidentiality. In diverse\npopulations where multiple languages are spoken, multi-\nlingual paper assessments are cumbersome and costly\n[26]. Mobile phones (like PDAs) easily integrate multiple\nlanguage assessments with a simple drop down menu of\nlanguage options. With regards to potential disadvan-\ntages, one of the drawbacks of using a paperless system is\nthat there is no paper questionnaire to review in the event\nthat problems are detected in the field. Also, although the\nautomated data upload reduces the potential for data loss,\nmobile phones are valued items in resource-limited set-\ntings [27]. Thus mobile phones can be stolen, or may\ncause research staff to be targeted when conducting house-\nhold surveys in high-crime areas. We chose to use entry\nlevel mobile phones for this very reason, but we did also\npermit the use of a paper and pencil version of the survey\nin isolated instances (for instance, if the CHW's felt threat-\nened in a particular household or area). It is tempting\nwith the introduction of a new technology to see it as a\npanacea for wide ranging methodological challenges that\nare common to most research. Using mobile phones for\ndata collection will for instance not be able to address\nissues such as household access, selecting an appropriate\nsample that permit generalization of findings, or the com-\nplexities of clustered sampling to reflect population statis-\ntics. On the other hand, the immediate real time access to\ndata significantly improves data quality, while the com-\nplex skip patterns of the mobile phone programme pro-\nvides comprehensive validity and readability checks\nwithin the instrument.\nCommunity health worker outputFigure 4\nCommunity health worker output.\n\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2009, 9:51 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/9/51\nPage 7 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nLimitations\nOur findings should be considered with the following\nlimitations in mind. First, it should be noted that our\nstudy design did not incorporate a control group. Thus, a\nrandomized basis for comparison is missing. Prior\nresearch has made use of control groups to evaluate the\nuse of PDA technology for data collection [21], so this\ncould be incorporated into future research on mobile\nphone technology. In addition, controlled studies of\nmobile phone data entry error rates are needed [26]. Sec-\nond, we employed a private digital technology company\nto provide programming support for the mobile phone\nsoftware. The issue of proprietary versus open source soft-\nware is a particularly important issue for mobile phone\nresearch in low and middle income countries. The Mobile\nResearcher software is not at present open source, but\nthere are plans for it to be made open-source within the\nnext six months. We would argue that, given budget con-\nstraints in most projects in low and middle income coun-\ntries, open source software is important. We acknowledge\nhowever, that proprietary solutions may also be of value\nto research teams in specific instances.\nConclusion\nOur experience with a large scale baseline survey suggests\nthat the real-time quality control and data collector super-\nvision enabled by the use of a mobile phone based survey\nsystem make this an attractive management option and\npreferable to a paper based approach. This mobile solu-\ntion has the potential to be scaled up in an extensive way\nfor teams and studies of almost any size. The benefits of\nmobile technology, combined with the improvement that\nmobile phones offer over PDAs in terms of data loss and\nuploading difficulties, make mobile phones a feasible\nmethod of data collection that needs to be further\nexplored. Rigorous controlled trials comparing data accu-\nracy, readability, reliability and validity checks comparing\npaper based approaches, PDA's and mobile phones are\nneeded. This should also include a cost effective analysis\nin small as well as large scale surveys.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nMT: Designed the study, designed the assessment instru-\nments, drafted the first version of the paper.
