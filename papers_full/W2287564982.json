The impacts of an in-service transformer failure can \nbe catastrophic as it may cause extended outages, costly \nrepairs and potentially serious injury or fatality. Furthermore, \nthe continuous increase in load demand, nonlinear loads, smart \nappliances and plug-in electric vehicles that are considered as \nsizeable, unpredictable and source of harmonics loads along \nwith the significant aged transformer population worldwide \nhas increased the likelihood o f transformer catastrophic \nfailures [1]. Therefore, it is essential to adopt reliable \ndiagnostic tools to precisely identify  the health condition and \nto provide a  proper maintenance action for in-service power \ntransformers. The majority of worldwide transformers \ncurrently in service were installed prior to 1980 and as a result \nthe bulk of the population is approaching or has already \nexceeded its design life [2-8]. This poses a significant risk for \nutilities and other power network stakeholders. Consequently, \nmonitoring and diagnostic techniques are essential to decrease \nmaintenance and to improve reliab ility of the existing power \ntransformers [9-11]. Bushings are one of the major \ncomponents causing forced o utages of power transformer s \n[12]. A CIGRE  international survey  [13] indicates that the \nmost frequent sources of transformer fail ures are attributed to \ntap changers, bushings, and paper-oil insulation system which \nis mainly deteriorated due to heat, oxida tion, acidity, and \nmoisture. Various diagnostic techniques have been adopted for \ntransformer bushing s such as visual inspection, i nfrared \nscanning, dc insulation resistance test, capacitance and power \nfactor (tanδ) measurement, partial discharge, oil sampling and \nfrequency response analysis [14-16].  \n   Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) is considered as a \nreliable tool to detect various winding deformations within \npower transformers. While many researchers investigated the \nimpact of various mechanical winding deformations such as \naxial displacement [17, 18], buckling deformation [19-21], \ndisk space variation [22] and short circuit turns [23\n] on the \ntransformer FRA signature, no attention was given to the \nimpact of transformer insulation aging and various bushings  \nfaults on the FRA signature  [20, 24, 25]. In this paper, the \ngeometric dimensions of a three -phase transformer including \ndetailed transformer windings, i nsulation system and bushings \nare simulated using 3D finite element modelling (FEM ) that \nallows the extraction of equivalent electrical circuit parameters \nof the transformer before and after applying a physical faults to \nthe model . In this way the impact of various faults on \ntransformer equivalent circuit parameters and hence on its \nFRA signature can be investigated. The impact of transformer \nbushings and i nsulation oil degradation on transformer FRA \nsignature is elaborated through simulation as well as practical \nmeasurement analyses.    \n2 INSULATION SYSTEM PROPERTIES \n    Moisture in transformer is caused due to  insulation aging, \natmospheric leak, cellulose decomposition and  after dry -out \nprocess where moisture migration between oil and paper \nDetection of Power Transformer Bushing Faults and Oil \nDegradation using Frequency Response Analysis \ninsulation takes place [26, 27]. Dissipation factor is a method \nto identify the moisture content inside the dielectric insulation \n[2, 16]. The complex permittivity *\noil\nε of transformer oil at a \ngiven frequency w (rad/s) and temperature T can be calculated \nas [9]: \n)()(2.2..\n)( \"'\n0\n* ωεωεωε\nσε jj\nTOil\noil\n−=+=                                 (1) \nwhere Oilσ is oil conductivity, 0ε is the permittivity of free \nspace.  \n   Dielectric behavior usually refers to the variation of 'ε  and \n\"ε with frequency, composition, temperature, and voltage [9]. \nThe real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity as a \nfunction of the frequency are given by [28]: \n22\n0'\n1 τω\nεεεε +\n−+= ∞\n∞\n                                                               (2) \n22\n0\n1\n)(\" τω\nωτεεε +\n−= ∞                                                                  (3) \nwhere ∞ε is the infinite-frequency dielectric constant and τ  is \nthe dielectric time constant.  \n   For an equal thickness of oil -paper composite transformer \ninsulation, τ   is given by [14]: \noilpaper\noilpaper\nσσ\nεετ +\n−=                                                                    (4) \nwhere, paperε  and oilε  are the  absolute values of permittivity \nfor paper and oil insulation ; paperσ and oilσ represent the \nconductivity of paper and oil insulation, respectively. \n   The computation of oil conductivity requires the transformer \nphysical geometry details as shown in Figure 1 and  dielectric \npermittivity of the test object [28]. \n \nFigure 1. Insulation System within a power transformer \n3 FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS \n   To emulate real power transformer operation, finite element \nmodelling (FEM) is used to construct a 3D model of the three-\nphase transformer shown in Fig ure 2. Parameters of the \nsimulated transformer are given in the Appendix. The FEM \ncan be manipulated to evaluate the impact of moisture ingress  \nand other contaminations of the transformer bushings and oil-\npaper insulation system on the transformer FRA signature. \nAny change in the oil-paper insulation  and or bushing \ncharacteristics will result in a change in the transformer \nequivalent circuit parameters shown in Fig ure 3 and hence on \nthe corresponding FRA signature. In the transformer \ndistributed parameters equivalent circuit shown in Fig ure 3, \nhigh voltage (HV) and low voltage  (LV) windings are \nrepresented by series resistance (R) and inductance (L) \nshunted by capacitor (C\ns) and conductance (G s). The \ncapacitance between HV and LV winding s (CHL) shunted by \ndielectric conductance (G HL) simulate the insulation between \nthe two windings. Also, the mutual inductances (M) between \nrelevant coils are represented. The dielectric insulation \nbetween the LV winding and the earthed core and that is \nbetween the HV winding and the earthed tank are simulated \nby a capacitance (C\n0) and dielectric conductance (G 0). \nTransformer bushing equivalent circuit is represented as a T -\nmodel and is discussed below.  \n \nFigure 2.

Transformer distributed parameters model  \n    Capacitance and Inductance matrices including bushing \nequivalent circuit parameters and transformer insulation \nequivalent capacitance are calculated using the electric and \nmagnetic energy density using Ansys FEM software [29]. \n \n \nM \nA. Transformer Bushing construction and equivalent circuit  \n   There are t wo common types of transformer bushings \nnamely, solid porcelain bushing which is used for small rating \ntransformers and oil filled condenser bushing , also known as \noil impregnated paper (OIP) bushing, that is used for large  \nrating transformers [30]. An OIP transformer bushing is \ncomposed of winding insulation paper around a central core as \nshown in Fig ure 4. The portions of bushi ng in air and inside \nthe transformer are considered in the simulation. At defined \nintervals, conductive sheets are placed between paper layers to \ncontrol the electric field distribution [31]. Layers of paper and \nfoil are usually filled with an insulating fluid such as oil . \nInsulation aging and moisture content have significant effects \non bushing dielectric properties.  \n   The main insulation system is represented by capacitance C1 \nin the equivalent  bushing T -model shown in Figure  5 while \nlayers near ground are represented by capacit ance C2. In the \nbushing model shown in Fig ure 5, Rs and L s represent the \ncentral conductor within the bushing that connects the line \nwith the transformer energised windings.  \n   Bushings are designed to have a constant dielectric \ncapacitance over the asset  operational life  [32]. Therefore, \nvariation in bushing capacitance can be used as an indicator of \na potential problem. An increase in capacitance by 3% to 5% \nis typically accepted as an indication of a problem within a \nbushing [33]. To accurately identify the effect of bushing \nfaults on the electrical parameters of bushing equivalent T -\nmodel, the physical geometrical dimension of a 10 kVA \nbushing of the three -phase transformer shown in Figure 2 is \nsimulated using 3D finite element software (Ansys) for \nhealthy and faulty conditions. Faulty bushing is emulated \nthrough alterin g its  insulation complex permittivity which is \ninfluenced by many factors such as  ambient temperature and \nthe structure of the insulation system [7]. \n \n       \nFigure 4. 3D model of Bushing solved in electrostatic FEM solver  \n   \nC1\nC2\nSignal Injected \nto Bushing\nSignal Injected to \nTransformer winding\nws RsLs Ls\nBushing aodel\n  \nFigure 5. Transformer Bushing layers and its equivalent T-model  \n   The electrical parameters for normal and faulty conditions are \nextracted using FEM based on the following three steps: \nStep 1 : The Transformer 3D model shown in Figure  2 is \nanalyzed using electrostatic, magnetostatic and dc conduction \nsolvers to obtain the capacitance, conductance and inductance \nmatrices for healthy condition . To extract the bushing \nequivalent T- model parameters, effect of capacitive grading \non the electric field distribution is also analysed.  \nStep 2: Faulty condition is simulated by changing the  \npermittivity of the transformer oil -paper insulation of the \nbushing and the corresponding variation s in the capacitance \nand inductance matrices for different faulty condition levels are \ncalculated using the  electrostatic, magnetostatic and dc \nconduction solvers.  \nStep 3: The FRA signature is plotted as the winding transfer \nfunction TF dB = 20 log 10|V0/Vin|  for healthy and faulty \nconditions. \nMoisture content inside the bushing leads to variation s of \nthe bushing capacitive components, C1 and C 2. In FEA, this \neffect can be simulated through changing the permittivity \nand/or conductivity of the dielectric insulation. In the \ntransformer model under study, m oisture content within \nbushing insulation is varied through increasing the oil-paper \npermittivity from 1% to 5%. Figure 6 shows the corresponding \npercentage change in the bushing capacitances C1 and C2 due \nto variation in the permittivity of the bushing dielectric \ninsulation. These results reveal that the variation of C1 is more \npronounced than C 2 for the same percentage increase in \ndielectric permittivity, e.g. a 2% increase permittivity leads to \n7.5% increase in C1 whereas the value of C2 increases by only \n3%.   \n    \nFigure 6. Capacitance variation of bushing  T-model due to permittivity \nvariation \n \nFigure 7. Variation of transformer oil effective capacitance due to \npermittivity variation \nFigure 7 shows the impact of increasing the permittivity of \ntransformer dielectric insulation on the variation of the total \ntransformer oil capacitance. The figure shows that oil effective \ncapacitance is increasing with the increase of permittivity  in \nthe two types of oil used in the simulation (vegetable and \nmineral). The increment in vegetable oil capacitance is \n1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 4.00\nPermitivity Variations (%)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16Oil Capacitance  Variations (%)\nCurve Info\nMineral Oil\nVegetable Oil\nhowever slightly more than that of mineral oil for  the same \npermittivity variation . It is worth mentioni ng that, these \ncalculations are conducted based on the assumption that the \noperating temperatures as well as the network frequency are \nkept constants. Simulation of moisture ingress within \ntransformer oil through increasing oil permittivity is based on \nthe fact that moisture content decreases the dielectric strength \nof the insulation oil which is corresponding to a decrease in its \ncapacitive reactance ( 1/wc). As the operating frequency is \nmaintained at the power frequency, decrement in capacitive \nreactance is corresponding to increment in the oil capacitance  \nwhich could be simulated through the increase in oil \npermittivity as shown in Figures 6 and 7 . It should be also \nnoted that, there is no precise mathematical correlation \nbetween the level of moisture content in transformer oil and its \ndielectric permittivity  developed yet . Some experimental \nresults are presented in section 5 to investigate this correlation.  \nVariation of oil conductivity can be calculated using the dc \nconduction solver provided by Ansys software as below: \n),(),(),( yxyxEyxJ φσσ ∇−==                                      (5) \nwhere, J is the current density, E is the electric filed intensity, \nσ is the conductivity of the material (s/m) andφis the electric \npotential.  \n \nFigure 8. Variation of oil conductivity due to permittivity variation \n   Figure 8 shows the percentage change in vegetable and \nmineral oils conductivities due to the increase in dielectric oil \npermittivity. F igure 8 reveals that the increase in oil \npermittivity increases its conductivity. Simulation results also \nshow that vegetable oil dielectric strength is slightly more \nsensitive to the  change in oil permittivity  than mineral oil as \ncan be seen in Figures 7 and 8.  \n4 IMPACT OF BUSHING FAULT AND INSULATION \nDEGRADATION ON FRA SIGNATURE \n   To show the impact of bushing model on the HV winding \nFRA signature, Fig ure 9 is plotted for the transformer model \nshown in Fig ure 3 with and without the inclusion of the \nbushing T-model. As shown in Figure 9, w ith the inclusion of \nbushing T -model, t he transfer function of the HV winding  \ndevelops new resonant  peaks after 700  kHz with a slight \nchange in the magnit ude. On the other hand, t he magnitude \nand the resonant peaks do not change from the low to mid \nfrequency range. This simulation result is confirmed by a \npractical FRA measurement that will be presented  in the next \nsection. This reveals  that, for accurate simulation of \ntransformer FRA signatures, bushing model should be \nincluded in the transformer high frequency  equivalent circuit \nmodel. The following case studies are conducted using FEA \nalong with the transformer distributed parameters -based \nequivalent model shown in Figure 3 with the inclusion of the \nbushing T-model shown in Figure 5.  \n \nFigure 9. FRA signature of the transformer distributed model shown in \nFig. 3 with and without the inclusion of bushing T -model  \nCase study 1 (bushing insulation degradation) \n   Figure 10 shows the variation of the HV FRA signature for \n2% and 4% increment in th e permittivity of the oil and paper \nwithin the transformer bushing. The figure shows that impact \nof moisture in oil on the FRA signature appears in the \nfrequency range above 700 kHz where the resonance and anti-\nresonance frequencies decrease with respect to the healthy \nsignature. The impact is more pronounced for more moisture \ncontent, which is simulated by more change in oil permittivity, \nwithin the oil.    \n \nFigure 10. Effect of m oisture content in bushing insulation on HV \nwinding FRA signature  \nCase study 2 (Transformer oil degradation) \n   In order to exactly simulate the transformer oil degradation \nutilizing transformer distributed parameter model, it is \nessential to detect the percentage change in the electrical \ncircuit parameters that is corresponding to a particular oil \ndegradation level.  \n \nFigure 11.

Impact of oil degradation on transformer FRA signature . \n   Figure 11 shows the effect of new insulation oil on the \ntransformer FRA sign ature when compared with the oil free \ntransformer FRA signature. As can be seen in Figure 11, new \ninsulating oil will shift the resonance peaks to the left on the \nentire frequency range with respect to the FRA signature of \nthe transformer without any insulation oil. This is attributed to \nthe fact that adding insulation oil will increase the overall \ncapacitance and hence reducing the resonance frequencies.  \n   The permittivity of the new oil is increased by 4%  to \nsimulate moisture contents in the oil. As shown in Figure 12, \noil degradation has a slight impact on the FRA signature at the \nhigh frequency range.  \nCase study 3 (Disk space variation) \n   To show the impact of the inclusion of the proposed bushing \nT-model in the transformer equivalent circuit, a disk space \nvariation (DSV) fault is simulated  on phase C  of the HV \nwinding as shown in Fig ure 13. Finite element calculations \nreveal that due to DSV,  the shunt capacitance at the location \nof the fault and some elements associated to  the inductance \nmatrix will change significantly  [11]. Figure 14 and Table 1 \nshow the variation of the resonant peaks with and without the \nbushing T-model connected to the transformer model  shown \nin Fig. 3. Figure 14 and Table 1 reveal that the variation of the \nresonant peaks due to DSV starts after 300 kHz and there is a \nconsiderable change in resonant peaks when the proposed \nbusing T-model is included.  This is attributed to the high \ncapacitive component added to the  transformer model when \nbushing model is considered.  \n \nFigure 13. Disk space variation fault on Phase C  \n \nFigure 14. Impact of DSV on FRA signature with and without bushing \nmodel  \nTable 1.

This is attributed \nto the fact that moisture distribution within transformer \ninsulation is not static due to water migration between solid \ninsulation and oil that mainly depends on insulati on \ntemperature. Cellulosic insulation is highly hydrophilic and it \ncontains most of the transformer water (about 1 to 5% in \nweight), whereas oil is less hydrophobic and normally \ncontains a few parts per million of water  [34, 35]. Figure 15 \nshows some practical measurements for the percentage change \nin oil permittivity and the corresponding moisture content in \ntransformer oil conducted on various power transformers for 5 \nyears [36]. Other parameters such as oil resistivity and \ndissipation factor are included in Table A.5 in the Appendix. \nThe obtained results show that moisture content in transformer \noil significantly affects oil relative permittivity (Ɛr).  \n \nFigure 15 Measurement of moisture variation versus Permittivity variation  \n   To assess the accuracy of the proposed bushing model,  the \nobtained simulation results shown above are compared with \npractical FRA signature  that is conducted on a three phase \n132kV, 35MVA power transformer at ambient temperature 25 \noC.  The FRA signature for phase A with and without the \nbushing is obtained using frequency response analyser as \nshown in Figure 16 which reveals the impact of the bushing on \n0 1 10 100 1000 3000\nFrequency (kHz)\n-100\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\nTF (dB)\nCurve Info\nNew oil insulating\nOld oil insulating\n0 1 10 100 1000 3000\nFrequency (kHz)\n-100\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\nTF (dB)\nCurve Info\nHealthy\nDisk space varition without bushing model\nDisk space varition with bushing model\n2.20 2.30 2.40 2.50 2.60 2.70 2.80 2.90\nPermitivity Variation(Er)\n15\n25\n35\n45\n55Moisture (PPM)\n \n \n    \n    \n \n \n \n  \n  \nthe transformer FRA signature in the high frequency range . \nThis confirms the simulation results of Figure 9.  \n \nFigure 16.  Practical phase-A FRA signature with and without bushing \n \nFigure 17. Practical phase-A FRA signature with new oil and with 3% \nmoisture content in the bushing oil   \n   The transformer bushing  oil is tested and 3% moisture \ncontent is found in the HV bushing of Phase-A. FRA \nmeasurement is conducted on this phase  and compared with \nthe FRA signature of the  same phase with new oil. As shown \nin Figure 17, resonant peaks in the high frequency range above \n700 kHz are shifted to the left due to the existence of moisture \nin bushing insulating oil. This confirms  the FEM simulation \nresults shown in Figure 10.  \n \nFigure 18. Practical FRA signature with and without insulating oil   \nTo investigate the impact of insulating oil on the FRA \nsignature, FRA measurement is conducted on Phase A of the \ntransformer HV windings with and without new insulating oil \nas shown in Figure 1 8. The FRA measured signature reveals \nthat the signature shifts to the left o n the entire frequency \nrange due to the change of the capacitance matri x elements. \nThis is similar to the simulation results obtained in Figure 11 \nand the practical test presented in [28].  \n6 CONCLUSION \nThis paper presents detailed simulation and practical \nanalyses to assess the impact of bushing and insulation  oil \nhealth condition on the transformer FRA signature. In contrary \nwith other papers that investigated the transformer FRA \nsignature using a high frequency transformer model without \nconsidering bushing model,  results of this paper shows that \nbushing model should be considered in  the transformer linear \nmodel for accurate FRA simulation . Bushing model increases \nthe capacitive components of the power t ransformer and \nconsequently, its impact is more pronounced in the high \nfrequency range. Simulation and practical results also show \nthat moisture within the  insulating oil of transformer bushing \ncan be detected in the high frequency range of the transformer \nFRA signature as it alters the resonance frequencies location \nand magnitude in this frequency range. The paper also \nintroduces effective charts for the correlation between \ntransformer oil permittivity and oil  capacitance and \nconductivity. These charts will aid in further studies about the  \ndevelopment of a precise correlation between moisture content \nin transformer oil and its dielectric permittivity.    \nAcknowledgment  \nAuthors would like to thank TxMonitor Company in Perth, \nWestern Australia, for provid ing the  practical measurements \nof Figure 15 and Table A.5. \nAppendix \nTable A.1.
