As a result of \nthis change, the individuals are expected to have different skills such as critical thinking skills, creativity, \nproblem-solving, and virtual coll aboration skills than skills business world asked workers to possess before \n(Davis, Fidler, & Gorbis, 2011). The World Economic Forum (2017) also mentioned the importance of such \nskills (i.e., problem -solving, human management, and emotional intelligence) in today's business world. \nChanges from workers triggered educational reform movements around the world. Different countries have \nmodified the science and mathematics curriculum to meet the business world expectations.  Educational reforms \nhave broadened a nd changed teachers’ and students’ roles. Schools put much pressure on teachers’ shoulders, \nand as a result, teachers’ workload has changed. Since educational reforms in science and mathematics \ncurriculums were one domain-oriented reform, these educational change movements in education did not satisfy \nthe business world and did not meet the needs of technology and engineering areas (Dugger, 2010). Considering \nscience and mathematics separated from technology was one of the reasons for the failure of these e ducational \nmovements (Morrison, 2006). Nuffield Foundation (1990) in England recognized this missing point and \nintroduced the Design & Technology (Banks & Barlex, 2014). Afterward, countries integrated these four areas, \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics into their curriculum. \n \nA science, mathematics, technology, and engineering (STEM) education is an interdisciplinary approach that \nwill offer students opportunities to understand the world around them (Yıldırım, 2016). Every individual must \nmeet the needs of 21st -century skills and understand the basic concepts of STEM areas. Instead of separating \nfour disciplines, STEM education integrated them into one cohesive teaching and learning paradigm (Ng & \nAdnan, 2018). STEM had different roles while  integrating different disciplines during the practice of teaching. \nSome researchers (such as Roehrig, Moore, Wang, & Park, 2012) highlighted that engineering education should \nhave a central role. On the other hand, another researcher, Corlu, Capraro, and Capraro (2014) defined STEM \neducation was an interdisciplinary approach that mathematics and science were a vehicle to bring together \nconcepts from more than one discipline. Additional to these perspectives, other educators put emphasized on \ntechnology. For instance, Şahin (2015) claimed that technology facilitated the discovery of new products and \nenhanced the implementation of STEM activities in different ways.  When technology use analyzed for STEM \neducation, two patterns emerged: (1) direct integration of technology into STEM activities design and \nembedding of technology into STEM activities; and (2) using technology as a facilitator of enriching STEM \n232        Yildirim, Sahin-Topalcengiz, Arikan, & Timur \nactivities (Şahin, 2015). Recently, the increased availability of 3D printing, 3D modeling, robotics had  opened \nthe ways too many new applications in STEM education (Yıldırım, Yıldırım, & Çelik, 2018; Barroso et al., \n2017; Chien, 2017; Kwon, 2017). 3D printings were used as an engaging tool in students' learning. Furthermore, \nvirtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) also became widely popular in recent years \nand were now widely used in many different field (Aslan, 2017; Cipresso Giglioli, Raya, & Riva, 2018).  \n \nExtended reality (XR), which blends virtual and real environments, is an um brella term covering VR, AR, and \nMR. VR is an interactive computer -based environment where users interact with computer -generated \nenvironments (Schwienhorst, 2002). VR was defined as a computer -generated simulation of a 3D environment \nwhere users were imme rsed in learning scenarios created with computer technologies (Martín -Gutiérrez, Mora, \nAñorbe-Díaz, & González-Marrero, 2017; Kayabaşı, 2005). Variety of terms are used to label the technology in \nthe educational research literature: virtual world (VW); vir tual environment (VE); multi -user virtual \nenvironment (MUVE); massively -multiplayer online (role -playing) game (MMO(RP)G); immersive virtual \nworld (IVW); immersive world; immersive online environment; 3D virtual learning environment; open -ended \nvirtual worlds; simulated worlds; serious virtual world; social virtual world; synthetic virtual world; and virtual \nlearning environment (VLE) (Girvan, 2018). In this research, VR is used as a term to describe any online \nenvironment that allows users to play, learn, or interact (Girvan, 2018); VR simulates real -life experiences and \nconstructs thoughts by using computers and various technological accessories (Duncan, Miller, & Jiang, 2012; \nHay, 1997; Yildirim, 2017). VR uses both 2D and 3D displays and provides users w ith realistic environments \n(Schwienhorst, 2002).  \n \nAR is a setting that combines a real setting with virtual objects. It is interactive in real -time; allows users to \ninteract with digital images while viewing the real scene (Azuma, 1997). Though Azuma (199 7) defines AR as a \nform of a virtual environment, there is a difference between AR and VR. VR allows users to immerse \nthemselves in a simulated environment completely. AR supplements reality rather than completely replacing the \nenvironment.  AR use d igital information that would be images, audios, videos, and a touch (Kipper, 2013). AR \nallow users to use five senses (Kılıç, 2016). Therefore, users experience real world environment in which virtual \nobjects and real objects are placed as seamless as possible (Kılıç, 2016). VR, on the other hand, blocks users’ \nvisual access to the real world since users’ ears and eyes covered with digital screen. Another term, MR, is a \nsetting that encompasses anything between a real scene and an immersed virtual scene (Milgram  et al., 1995). \nAlthough VR, AR, and MR have been around for years, it is just entered the education arena. Until recently, a \ntraditional computer equipped with a camera was the only technological instrument that had been used in the \nclassroom. The explosion of mobile phones, laptops, rapid increases in computer speeds, and the increase in the \navailability of the internet to the public allowed to use of ER in different areas, including the classrooms. \nSeveral barriers, including high software and hardware c osts, low -quality instructional design, and problems \nassociated with the early computer systems, prohibited the use of ER in the K -12 educational settings (Olmos et \nal., 2018; Zantua, 2017). Recent advancements in smartphones, tablets, and laptops have wea kened the obstacles \nand provided low -cost alternative ER technologies (Zantua, 2017). For instance, Google Cardboard viewfinder \nis an example of low -cost ER technologies (Truman, 2017). In 2015, Google introduced the Expeditions VR \nsystem, which is a virtu al reality system for K -12 classroom use. Even though the Google Cardboard app and \nvarious VR apps provide a single user VR experience, Google Expedition provides affordable virtual field trips \nfor the K -12 students (Lee, Sergueeva, Catangui, & Kandaurova,  2017). To conduct a virtual field trip, the \nExpeditions app needs to be downloaded on a smartphone, placed in a viewfinder, and connected to the router. \nStudents are provided with a viewfinder with an inserted smartphone opened to the Expeditions app. The  \nteachers select the field trip location from over 500 field trips on the computer or tablet. Students then see the \nopening scene for the field trip. Teachers guide students through the virtual environment by asking questions. \nThe studies' low -cost VR in e ducational environments is just begun to examine. The low -cost VR offers \nopportunities for enhancing learning across a range of areas, and this area should be investigated further \n(Castelvecchi, 2016). \n \nStudies have shown that VR technology can be beneficial for students when appropriately adapted to the \nclassroom and used (Black, 2017; Kickmeier-Rust, Hann, & Leitner, 2019; Zhou, Ji, Xu, & Wang, 2018). The \nuse of VR in the classroom increases learners’ e ngagement in an active learning environment (Allcoat & Von \nMühlenen, 2018). While students involved in the VR system, users could not interact with the real world that \nsurrounds them. Users interact with virtual objects. VR was one of the ways to manipulat e, visualize, and \ninteract with sophisticated computer systems and data (Çavaş, 2004). Another benefit is that using VR instead of \nphysical ones allowed students to do more experiments than physical experiments (Yıldırım, Yıldırım, & Çelik, \n2018). Thus, st udents collected more information in the same amount of time it would take to do physical \nexperiments.  VR was enabled students to learn more about the phenomena in the closest setting to real life by \nproviding the learner with a three -dimensional environm ent (Kim, 2006). This kind of learning settings \n233 \n \nJ Educ Sci Environ Health \nimproves students’ success. VR also allowed learners to collaborate in the learning environment (Dickey, 2005). \nFurthermore, VR increases students' motivation to learn (Çavaş & Can, 2004). VR improves student s' spatial \nabilities, whereas students’ motivation for learning was improved. VR facilitate student -centered learning \n(Martin-Gutierrez & Meneses, 2014; Di Serio, Ibáñez, & Kloos, 2013). VR also improved the ability of hearing -\nimpaired students’ ability to find a solution for different problems (Passing & Eden, 2000). Since the idea of VR \nintroduced, there has been significant interest in using VR technology in education. VR technology has been \nused in K -12 and higher education in different forms such as th e expeditions programs to go on virtual field \ntrips around the world, simulations, 360-degree video and photography, head-mounted display gear, data gloves, \nand bodysuits to give users a fully engaged with learning experiences (Black, 2017). As the schools  have greater \naccess to technology, a growing group of teachers has started to use VR in their classroom (Castaneda et al., \n2017; Aktepe, 2011; Çağıltay, Çakıroğlu, Çağıltay, & Çakıroğlu, 2001). Even though, the benefits of VR and \nthe difficulties of VR ha ve been described by the research and teachers were well -supported to use VR during \nthe instruction, the effectiveness of using VR in the classroom have not been monitored and evaluated (Çiftçi, \nTaşkaya, & Alemdar, 2013; Deniz, 2005). Therefore, this study  aimed to evaluate teachers’ experiences of using \nVR in the classroom and to determine teachers’ instructional technology practices in the classroom. For this \nresearch, teachers from a variety of backgrounds (one English teacher, one biology teacher, two m iddle school \nscience teachers, and three geography teachers) were selected and were involved in different tasks where they \ncan experience different applications of VR. \n \n \nMethod \n \nWe used a qualitative method, a case study design, to reveal teachers’ opinion s about VR after applying VR in \nthe classrooms and collected qualitative data. Case studies referred to a group of methods that allows examining \nthe in-depth study of subject or situation within a specific period (Creswell, 2003). Different data sources us ed \nin the case of studies at the same time, and this provides a holistic interpretation of the study (Merriam,1998). \nThis approach was selected as it would allow getting an in -depth understanding of the insight teachers \ndeveloped the effectiveness, usefulness, critiques, and limitations of the VR.  \n \n \nParticipants  \n \nThe stratified purposive sampling method was used to select participating teachers. The stratified purposeful \nsampling allows researchers to capture significant variations rather than to determin e common characteristics \n(Patton, 1990). Seven teachers (one English teacher, one biology teacher, two middle school science teachers, \nand three geography teachers) from different public schools volunteered to participate in this study. Teachers \nwere selec ted from different seven school sites from central Anatolia. These schools represented a range of \ncurrent technology initiatives, they had well -established maintenance arrangements to quick repairs, they were \nwell-equipped, and they were willing to share t heir insights after the implementation of VR. Teachers’ computer \nskills were in general at basic to intermediate level. They did not know about VR. While selecting teachers, \nrecommendations from technology departments  in each school were taken. Technology  departments evaluated \nteachers based on their willingness to adopt technology into the curriculum, their openness to use technology, \nand their experience for using technology in the classroom. Technology departments suggested potential \nparticipants from volunteer teachers.  \n \nTable 1.

After teachers were identified consent forms and \ninformative letters sent each teacher via e -mail, and the researcher maintained all consent forms. Since the \nmaximizing, the impact of professional development was a high priority for the researchers, teachers who would \n234        Yildirim, Sahin-Topalcengiz, Arikan, & Timur \nhave a significant influence on their co -workers was another criterion. For this  reason, teachers with at least \nthree years of teaching experience were preferred over less experienced teachers. The demographics of the \nteachers collected through a demographic information form (Table 1).  \n \n \nProcedures \n \nThree stages were involved in this  study (Figure 1): (1) Pilot study: Instruction on VR took two weeks with one \nteacher. The first draft of the Virtual Reality Interview Form (VRIF) was given to three teachers (2) Three \nweeks (6 hours per week) training with teachers (3) Teachers’ implemen tation of VR in the classroom for two \nmonths. The interviews were conducted with teachers at the end of the second month (Figure 1).  \n \nResearch Procedure (For 3 Months) \nTwo weeks \n(4 hours per \nweek) \n \nThree weeks \n(6 hours per \nweek) \n \nTwo months \n(16 hours \nper week) \n \nOne week \nPilot study \n(First draft of VRIF; \nInstruction on VR) \nTeacher Training \nClassroom Practice \nInterviews \nFigure 1. Research procedure \n \nThe pilot study was conducted with one elementary teacher to gather feedback from the participant experiences \nabout using Google Cardboard and Google Expeditions, her implementation of VR, and Web 2.0 in the \nclassroom. The elementary te acher was purposely selected for the pilot study. Since elementary teachers teach \ndifferent subjects, they have content knowledge in different areas. Therefore, researchers assumed that an \nelementary teacher was the best option for the pilot study.  \n \nTable 2.

The latest version of the curriculum \nincluded following areas: STEM education, the role of technology in STEM areas, Technological Pedagogical \nContent Knowledge, Implementation of Technology in the Cl assroom, Web 2.0, Virtual Reality,  Google \nExpeditions, Curriculum Development. Seven teachers received intensive training during the professional \ndevelopment about the subjects that were given before. Teachers developed lesson plans on different topics \nwhere they incorporated different Web 2.0 tools, Google Expeditions, and Google Cardboard. Topics were \n235 \n \nJ Educ Sci Environ Health \nselected based on National Science, Biology, Geography, and Second Language Curriculum. Teachers shared \nstudent learning activity descriptions in an online classroom, Google Classroom, every week. Once the \nprofessional development completed, they implemented the lesson plans and student learning activities in the \nclassroom during the two months. During the different implementation classes covering different t opics was \ntaught by seven instructors with extensive teaching experience in Science, Geography, English, and Biology. \nTopics covered in the classrooms based on subjects, grade, and thematic units in Google Expeditions were given \nin Table 2. \n \nThe study incorporated Virtual Reality Cardboard, similar to that shown in Figure 2, Google cardboard version \n3.0 viewer in conjunction with a smartphone that is capable of running VR applications and VR 360° videos in \nan extensive professional development for in -service teachers. VR Cardboard is an affordable technology \ncompared to other VR devices such as head -mounted display gears and data gloves. Google Cardboard and \nexpedition has launched in 2016 and includes a collection of linked VR content and supporting materia ls that \ncan be used along with existing curriculums for different subject areas. This technology can be used for \nvisualizing of astronomy, biology, literature, math, foreign language, geography, and physics. Nowadays, \nteachers and most of the students own a smartphone, tablet, and VR cardboard; and Google Cardboards can be \ncheaply purchased. Since the smartphones and tablets are available for students and teachers in the classroom, \nthese devices can be easily used in conjunction with Google Cardboard and Go ogle Expeditions if the teacher \nwants to use Google Cardboard while teaching, the teacher installs the Google Expedition app on a mobile \ndevice or a tablet. Expedition app is free and available on Google Play for Android devices \n(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.vr.expeditions). Following, the teacher purchased \nGoogle Cardboard for each student from AmazonTR. The price of the cardboard was around $4 for one student. \nWith a single teacher tablet or a mobile phone and students' smartph ones, Google Expeditions can be efficiently \nrun during the class. Depending on students’ preferences, some used tables which were available at the school \nand some students used their own Android phones. After installation of the app, the necessary purchasi ng \ngadgets, Google Cardboard, the teacher selects a specific VR Expedition and act a guide during that journey. \nMeanwhile, students open the app and act as Explorer of the teacher selected Expedition. Students view the \nsame scene what their teachers view. Google Expeditions allow the teacher to select the content that is related to \nthe aim of the lesson. Moreover, since each of the expeditions comes with information and questions about the \n3D environment, this will allow students to engage with what they are seeing. \n \n \nFigure 2. Virtual reality cardboard display \n \n \nInstruments \n \nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with the teachers to determine their opinions about VR. Semi -\nstructured interviews were allowed the interviewee to follow the interviewer’s train of thought, allows two -way \ncommunication (Merriam, 2009).\"Virtual Re ality Interview Form (VRIF)” was used as a data source in this \nstudy. The first draft of the interview form consisted of 17 questions and was designed by the researchers. This \nform was modified according to two field experts’ opinions, and this modified ve rsion was used to be \ninterviewed with three teachers. Thirty minutes of interviews with three teachers were audio -recorded and later \ntranscribed. After necessary small changes were made, the second version of the form was created. This second \nversion of the form consisted of 14 questions and used for the interviews with teachers (Table 3). The interviews \ncompleted with teachers conducted after their implementation of VR in the classroom. Teachers' interviews (105 \nminutes) were audio-recorded. These interviews were semi-structured, and participants were asked to detail their \nresponses given in the questionnaire. The purpose of these interviews was to get an in -depth understanding of \n\n236        Yildirim, Sahin-Topalcengiz, Arikan, & Timur \nteachers’ use of VR. Through the interviews, the insight teachers developed r egarding effectiveness, usefulness, \ncritiques, and limitations of the use of VR to teach different subjects were examined. The study was summarized \nbelow in Table 3. \n \nTable 3.

Content analysis methods require to transform a large amount of data into a highly \norganized and summary of the resu lts (Mostyn, 1980). The data analysis was conducted by the authors and \ninvolved several steps. First, audio recordings were transcribed. Then each author independently read responses. \nSecond, researchers discussed their interpretations of responses and cam e to a consensus about the codes and \nperceived the meaning of responses. The coder reliability for the study was calculated by using formula \n[(Consensus / Consensus + Disagreement) * 100] and was calculated as (60/60 + 15) * 100) = 80% for the study \n(Miles & Huberman, 1994). Since the coding results are above %80, the coding was reliable (Miles & \nHuberman, 1994). \n \n \nResults  \n \nThe results of the analyses are reported in the following order: teachers’ opinions about instructional technology \npractices and teach ers’ opinions about the use of VR in the classroom. To gain a deeper understa nding of \nteachers’ practice,  researchers first explored teachers’ opinions about the use of ITP for instruction, then \nteachers’ way of using VR was examined. \n \n \nTeachers’ Opinions about Using the ITP for Instruction \n \nThe result of the analyses indicated that teachers provided answers related to their ITP in the classroom. All \nparticipants confirmed their use of technology to some extent in the classroom. More than half of teachers s tated \nthat they always used technology in their classes  (Figure 3). Teacher five mentioned that she used technology \npractices to give children a comfortable learning environment.  \n \n       \nFigure 3. The sample photos from different classes \n \n\n237 \n \nJ Educ Sci Environ Health \nTeacher six highlighted that her daily curricular goal determined her choice of technology use. Teacher four said \nshe integrated technology to reinforce students’ learning. The following exemplary statement provided an \nanswer regarding technology use: \n \n T4: I use tech nology practices… not always, of course. I often include during the instruction or after \n the instruction. \n \n T5: I try to use technology practices at one of my lessons every week. I believe, teaching with \n technology practices will create a warm environment, and this will allow my students to learn. \n \n T6: I use technological practices whenever I need them. I do not always use technology. Depending on \n my daily curricular goal, I decide. \n \nFollowing these questions, the kinds of technology practices used by teachers in the classroom were asked. \nTechnology practices performed by teachers included animations, slides/prezi, smartboard, increased reality and \n4d programs. Teachers pointed out that they mostly use animation s and slides. Besides these two, smartboard \napplications, videos, increased reality, and the teachers also used 4D programs.  \n \nTable 4.

It was concluded that using technology support \nstudents’ learning, improve students’ technology literacy, individualize learning, support student -centered \npractice, makes difficult concepts easier to understand for students, individualize learning, makes possible to \nestablish multiple learning settings at the same time, and makes possible to see different perspectives (Table 4).  \n \n \nFigure 4. Sample photo of students using technology in the classroom \n \nSeveral teachers with teacher -centered beliefs perceived that students’ interaction with computers fosters \nstudent-centered learning. These teachers used technology to master what they already taught in the classroom. \nOther teachers with student -centered beliefs believed technology use in the classroom support student -centered \nlearning and independent learning  (Figure 4) . With technology integration, students could learn at their own \ntime. These teachers acknowledged that technology encourages st udents to explore the concepts. The exemplary \nanswers were provided below: \n \n \n\n238        Yildirim, Sahin-Topalcengiz, Arikan, & Timur \n T4: Technology help s students to understand tough subjects. Thanks to simulations, virtual labs, my \n students get a chance to experiment in an online environment. Since doing thi s kind of experiment \n dangerous, technology also creates a safe learning environment too. Furthermore, I do not need to \n request some laboratory materials from my school. It is also cheap. \n \n T5: I believed technology creates independent learners. People do not need to follow the teacher’s \n instructions anymore. Technology allows learners to individualize instruction.  \n \n T7: Technology impacts the way my students learn. Possibly my students are more independent now \n because they work independently. My students take ownership of their learning. Besides technology \n affected the way, I evaluated my students and my preparation for the class too.  \n \n T2: When I used different technologies in the class, students’ motivation increased. They do not want \n to finish the activity that I open on the computer. \n \n T3: Through computers, students can reach many sources. When I use a problem -based approach, they \n can easily access many sources available on the inter net. In the beginning, they have difficulties in \n differentiating reliable sources, but not they are good at it. They use these sources to solve the problem \n that I pose at the beginning of the class. \n \n \nTeachers’ Opinions about the Use of VR in the Classroom \n \nThe analyses indicated that teachers used VR for different purposes (Table 5).  Teachers believed that with the \nhelp of VR, learning would be exciting and fun. Teachers recognized that the use of VR increased students’ \nattention and motivation in the c lassroom (Figure 5). They also used VR to travel distant locations such as the \ninterior of the volcano. Furthermore, teachers highlighted that VR allowed teachers to act as a facilitator in the \nclassroom. They devoted more time to learning students’ learning styles, and based on their observations, they \nplanned adjustments in the classroom. \n \n  \nFigure 5. The Use of Virtual Reality Cardboard in the Classroom \n \nFurthermore, VR made it possible to explore the situations that were impossib le to explore in the real world \nwith the naked eye, for example visiting the inside of matter (molecules). The exemplary answers were provided \nbelow: \n \n T2: Some modeling and animations programs were beneficial for students to visualize some concepts. \n For instance, with the use of VR, students traveled inside the human body and explored the organs.  \n \n T4: I do not think VR could make teachers irrelevant in the classroom. VR allowed me to track my \n students’ understanding of the topics that I taught and made necessary changes  based on my \n observations and these assessments. Also, the way I assess students changed too. I believe with the \n appropriate use of VR; teachers act as a facilitator in the classroom. \n \n\n239 \n \nJ Educ Sci Environ Health \n T5: Complex and challenging concepts such as climate change were eas ily explained with the use of \n VR. Students tried to come up with a solution for some environmental issues. This method would \n benefit students from a deeper level of connection with a concept. \n \n T7: I recognized that VR learning experiences were valuable for rural students. They explored the \n inside of the cave. In daily life, students were not able to visit this place. Exploring caves, exploring \n submarines made the learning more exciting and fun. Students paid more attention to the topics and \n participated actively in the classroom. \n \nTable 5.

They pointed out that VR would be used in \neducation, health, art, construction, home, and entertainment. The exemplary answers were provided below: \n \n T5: VR could be used in different areas: such as cinema, the entertainment industry. VR was standard \n in science fiction movies. It is used to turn fantastical thins into things that seem real.  \n \n T6: VR could be used in many different fields, such as education, health, and traffic. For instance, VR \n could be used to educate people about driving safety. Besides, doctors also use 3D models to plan their \n operations. \n \n T7: VR would be used to help stu dents with special needs. You could do exercises with autistic \n students using VR. \n \nTable 6.

Teachers pointed out that the use of VR had some \nbenefits. Students discovered new technologies. The VR made the teaching/learning process more exciting and \nfun for students. The VR could assist the teachers in improving their aware ness of students’ learning \ndifferences. VR was effective for experiments that difficult to carry out in the classroom. VR experiences \nmotivated students to learn the topic. The VR increased student interest in learning activities and students fully \nparticipated in the activities. Table 6 provided a summary of teachers’ opinions about the benefits of VR use. \nTeachers said the followings regarding the benefits of VR use they experiences:  \n \n T4: Unlike 2D visuals that I used earlier in the science class, studen ts examined the inside of the \n molecules and other tiny particles in the mater. So, I had a chance to show and explain besides proton \n and neutron other small particles existed in the nucleus. \n \n T5: I used to ignore tablet use in the class. Bringing a tabl et with different applications into the \n classroom had drawn students’ attention to the topic. \n \n T6: Students found some topics boring before. With the VR applications, students paid more attention \n to the topic and wanted to learn the next topic. \n \n240        Yildirim, Sahin-Topalcengiz, Arikan, & Timur \n \nFigure 6. Use of Virtual Reality Cardboard in Education \n \nLastly, the question about “How does the use of VR affect your opinion about technology integration in the \nclassroom? Why?” was asked to the teachers (Table 7). Teachers mentioned that the use of VR in t he classroom \nenhanced their intention to use technology for education  (Figure 6). During teacher training, teachers developed \nspecific skills such as the ways of determining students’ needs, identifying the most recent technology, and \ncombined these skills into practice. The exemplary answers were provided below: \n \n T2: The VR increased student participation and motivation for learning. VR created an experience for \n students to enhance their critical thinking skills cause students actively involved in problem -solving \n scenarios. \n \n T3: Students were excited about the topic. I do not have any evidence that showed students’ \n improvement in learning, but I could assure you that they were excited about learning. \n \nTable 7.

The data obtained from interviews with teachers demonstrated that teachers used different instructional \ntechnology practices such as 4D programs, smartboard, simulations, animations, and videos. This finding  \nsupported by the data from capture d classroom scenes too (Figure 5 ). This finding also supported the research \nwhich was determined teachers’ instructional technology practices in the classroom (Keleş, Öksüz, & \nBahçekapılı, 2013). Another finding from this  study was that teachers used technology to prepare classroom \ninstructional materials, to support student -centered instructions, to individualize learning, to make difficult \nconcepts easier to understand for students. These results were consistent with the  relevant literature (McKnight \net al.,2016; Yüksel & Adıgüzel, 2012; Glassett & Schrum, 2009).  \n  \nFurthermore, another aim of this study was to determine teachers’ opinions about VR use for instruction. \nTeachers pointed out that using VR for instruction of fers opportunities for students. These opportunities are: (1) \nVR captured students’ interest, increased their creativity. (2) VR could allow students to take virtual trips and to \nexplore situations that were impossible to explore in the real world. (3) Usi ng VR for instruction increased \nstudents’ motivation and attention to the subject. (4) Using VR allowed teachers to act as a facilitator in the \nclassroom. (5) Using VR allowed students to discovered new technologies. (6) Using VR allowed teachers to \ndevote more time to know their students’, their learning styles. (7) VR allowed teachers to carry out experiments \nthat difficult to do in the classroom. The captured scenes from the classroom while teaching respiratory system \n\n241 \n \nJ Educ Sci Environ Health \nsupport this findings as well (Figure 6).These results were consistent with relevant studies (Yıldırım et al., 2018; \nKeskin, 2017; Tepe, Kaleci, & Tüzün, 2017; Tüzün & Özdinç, 2016; Fineschi & Pozzebon, 2015; Jeong, Park, \nKim, Oh, & Yoo, 2011; Çoruh, 2011; Kartigo, Kavakli, & Cheng, 2010; Su n, Lin, & Wang, 2010; Dalgarno, \nBishop, Adlong, & Bedgood, 2009; Mishra, 2009; Aoki, Ohno, & Yamaguchi, 2005; Manseur, 2005; Bakas & \nMikropuolus, 2003). For instance, Manseur (2005) used VR for teaching abstract topics such as molecular \nsystems, galaxies, astronomy topics. The VR allowed students to visualize these topics and enriched instruction.  \nFurthermore, during the interview teachers stated that VR was used in different fields in daily life such as \neducation, health, and art.  \n \nThe potential problems of using VR were not asked the teachers directly during the interviews; however, \nteachers mentioned that they had different barriers while implementing VR for instruction. These barriers were: \nsafety and security, student access, and t echnology gap. Teachers pointed some teachers were confident in their \ntechnical abilities, but others had a lower comfort level in using and implementing the technology. They stated \nthat teachers’ age might be a barrier in their comfort level to use techno logy for instruction. Fernandez (2017) \nalso highlighted that teachers were the leading facilitator for the adoption of VR for instruction.  Additionally, \nteachers mentioned that the internet environment should be safe for students, and access to computer h ardware \nwould be ready for students. Regarding these barriers, student safety, access, and security should be a top \npriority before any student involvement in technology usage (Sharples, Graber, Harrison, & Logan, 2009).  \n \nInnovation in VR provides a bette r learning environment for students. However, there are some risks and \nnegative aspects of the use of this technology in schools. First, the use of this type of application may cause \nstudents to isolate themselves from their peers (Gudoniene & Rutkauskiene , 2019; Liou et al., 2017). During the \nlearning process, learners interact with teaching materials, imitate scientists or engineers' ways of producing \nknowledge/material, and collaborate  with their peers, exchange ideas with one another. These types of \ninteractions are not that common in VR environments. Even though there has been progressed made in the \ndevelopment of these devices, current devices only allow transferring one kind of information in one sense. \nThere is a need to find a way to track user inte raction with the environment in different senses. Current \nvisualization tools and audio devices are expensive. For instance, one gadget from Oculus Rift and HTC Vive \ncosts more than $300, and both require a computer with high processing capacity. To buy a complete set of \nthese devices to enjoy a virtual reality experience, teachers need to pay more than $3500.  \n \nOn the other hand, low -cost devices that use smartphones processing capacity exist in the market. These \nprovided supplementary materials cost below $100. The supplementary materials in the market allow users to \ninteract with the material in one sense —for instance, Samsung's track -pad increases users' interaction with the \nenvironment. If the teacher wants to add headphones with high quality, this price goes up. Manufacturers do not \nprovide supplementary materials without charging mo. Therefore, teachers need  to provide all the materials \nwhich seem impossible for the whole class.  \n \nThe second barrier is the schools and the teachers (Liou et al., 2017). Teachers have not been trained to use this \ntechnology in the classroom. Teachers do not know what VR is and w hat its possibilities and its potentials are. \nTeachers' knowledge of VR technology in specific educational contexts is limited, or they do not know. \nTeachers' limited or no knowledge is, without a doubt, one of the main barriers.  \n \n The next barrier is cont ent of VR technologies. The current VR content is not adopted based on topics in the \ncurriculums. The current VR contents only offer students exciting experiences. Using them as teaching material \nor adapting them as classroom material is not easy or possib le always. These materials must feed the curriculum \nand vice versa. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nThe use of VR in education has grown dramatically in recent years as a result of drastic improvements in \ntechnology and low manufacturing cost. Drop -in prices have made VR m ore accessible to the schools. The use \nof VR in the classroom allowed students to interact with unobservable phenomena, to take virtual trips, \nincreased students' motivation, engagement, and creativity. Further, the use of these tools allowed teachers to a ct \nas a facilitator in the classroom. On the other hand, the use of VR brought some barriers as well such as safety \nand security, student access, and technology gap. Teachers’ confidence and comfort level might be a factor that \naffects teachers' implementation of VR for instruction. An essential conclusion regarding teachers’ comfort level \nwas that teachers unconsciously might be rejecting the use of new technologies in the instruction. The \npossibilities for educators to explore, learn, and experience a VR should be offered for teachers. An orientation \n242        Yildirim, Sahin-Topalcengiz, Arikan, & Timur \nmodule would be provided teachers with opportunities to learn, practice, and apply their VR skills before being \nplaced in the classroom. Fernandez (2017) also supported the idea of developing modules for teach ers and added \ntwo fundamental points of any VR training of teachers must have (1) The detailed information about VR (2) \nPossibilities and potentials of VR. Teachers also highlighted that whoever participates in VR, they must have \nthe necessary computer ski lls. Furthermore, teachers should keep students safe in online environments. Further, \nsupport and collaboration between the instructional technology department, other departments, and law \nenforcement should determine students’ safety and security in VR environments. \n \n \nLimitations \n \nThe limitation of this study was based on the generalizability characteristics of the study. As previously \nmentioned, the research participants were selected from volunteers. Teachers’ VR experience did not consider \nas a criterion for selecting a research participant. Therefore, future research should select teachers who met the \ncriteria of having VR experience. VR had not been used for instructional purposes or enrichment activities in \ndifferent subjects before. Since students had never been experienced VR, future research focuses on longitudinal \nstudies across a school year to mitigate the effect of using the new approach. Due to time constraints, the \nshortage of the funds, and diverse cities teachers were in, only interviews cond ucted with teachers after the \nstudy. Therefore, additional qualitative data sources such as classroom observations, interviews with students, \nand the quantitative data sources such as surveys should be used as data sources in future studies. A case study \nfor each teacher may also provide additional insight into teachers’ and students’ experiences with VR, as well as \nbetter insight into how VR influences students’ and teachers’ motivation, and students’ learning.  \n \n \nAcknowledgments or Notes \n \nThe authors would  like to acknowledge and thank the teachers and students for their participation in the \nresearch. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAktepe, V.
