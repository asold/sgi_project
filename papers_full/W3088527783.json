INTRODUCTION \nA relevant influence on the manufacturing accuracy at the workpiece is t he motion \naccuracy of the machine tool. Typically, it becomes exemplary effective not until the operatio-\nnal state, due to manufacturing, assembly and setup of the machine tool. Moreover, depending \non installation as well as environmental and operating conditions , properti es and states  \nof machine parts and components, and thus, the motion accuracy, change over time for various \nreasons, such as tool or workpiece change, run -in, wear, overload, collisions, lubrication or \ntransient behaviour. In order to ensure compliance with the accuracy requirements and to \n_____________ \n1 Institute of Mechatronic Engineering, Chair of Machine Tools Development and Adaptive Controls, TU Dresden, \nGermany  \n* E-mail: bernd.kauschinger@tu-dresden.de \n  https://doi.org/10.36897/jme/119678 \nB.

In this context, there are two purposes of evaluation measurements: \n1. The motion accuracy is checked and validated for compliance with the accuracy require-\nments. Rather integral instead of detailed information is sufficient for this, which usually \ncan be acquired by so-called performance tests, e.g. [1, 2]. Suitable measurements must \ndeliver trustable s tatements of rather qualitative nature as a basis for decisions, if \nadditional measures, efforts or investments will be necessary or not . For economical \nreasons, only low effort is accepted to derive statements for decision support. \n2. If accuracy requirement s are not met, then additional measures to improve motion \naccuracy are necessary. Among others, a variety of model based correction approaches \nis used, which requires the determination or calibration of model parameters [3–5]. \n3. This is based on exemplary me asurements of the motion accuracy, which are  \nof quantitative nature, in principle. Here, usually a higher effort is needed and accepted \nto get calibration values that essentially determine the quality of correction results. \n Particular evaluation scenarios allocated in the life cycle of machine tools are \nexemplarily listed in Table 1. They preferably consider the machine tool in an operational \nstate and differ in both the required evaluation statements and the accepted effort. \nTable 1.

The larger number \nof interpolated feed-axes results in an even greater variation of the already position dependent \nmachine behavior [7] in the workspace.  Moreover, besides a high repeat ability also a high \n46  B. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 \n \n \nabsolute accuracy of the machine tool in its whole workspace is demanded. This intensifies \nthe problem of volumetric motion accuracy, including its measurement and evaluation in up \nto 6 DOF. In future, a more frequent validation of volumetric motion accuracy will be required \nto support decisions about cont inued production or necessary maintenance or repair. \nScenarios of fast machine diagnostics and repeated measurements that are carried out by  \nthe machine operator  itself and limit unproductive machine downtime will become more \nimportant. However, usually it may be more expensive than necessary  to use measuring \nmethods that are suitable for calibration measurements for this, even though there are also \nattempts for uniform measurements, e.g [8]. Suitable measuring methods to deliver statements \nfor decision support must meet the following requirements for fast performance tests: \n– fast, simple and robust measuring procedure, \n– applicable in the operational state of the machine, \n– measuring accuracy better than manufacturing accuracy required, \n– low effort for installation, setup and execution of the measurements, \n– representative coverage of the workspace in all relevant DOF (up to 6), \n– low investment and operating costs of the measuring system. \nAlthough, there is a va riety of measuring systems and methods for the evaluation  \nof motion accuracy of machine tools used so far, none really fulfils all of the requirements. \nThis motivated the development of the measuring method proposed in this article. \nDue to its large measuring range combined with a high measuring accuracy and resolu-\ntion laser based measurement is advantageous for calibration and correction approaches. \nVolumetric errors in the workspace are captured by 3D laser trackers or by multi -lateration \nwith 1D l acer tracers or 1D laser ballbars. Axis specific errors are captured with 1D to 6D \nlaser interferometers  (Fig. 1).  MultiLine laser systems can capture absolute distances  \nof multiple measuring lines in up to 32 channels. However, since laser based equipment is not \nleast one of the most expensive one, it is rather in economic for a fast validation of motion \naccuracy. Moreover, setup and use are time-consuming in many cases. \n \nFig. 1. Examples of measuring systems for the evaluation of machine accuracy \n\nB. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 47 \n \n \nThere are also measuring systems and methods, that base on specific reference artifacts, \nlike prismatic references, precision balls, ball plates or cross grids. Measuring systems like \nlinear gauges, touch probes, QuickCheck, R -Test or cross grid encoders (KGM) a re used to \nmeasure geometric deviations with reference to these artifacts (Fig. 1). However,  \nthe statements derived are either limited to single poses or axes in the workspace or very time-\nconsuming for a larger number of poses or axes. Moreover, the prec ision requirements for  \nthe artifacts are high to be suitable as reference, which usually makes them quite expensive.  \nAnother common approach is the machining of test workpieces (Fig. 2) and their \nsubsequent evaluation by a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). However, this procedure \nis time -consuming and requires additional material expenses (e.g. work pieces, auxiliary \nmaterial) as well as additional survey at a CMM. The derivable statements are limited to  \nthe workspace volume covered by the test workpiece and current machining conditions. Due \nto the effort, machining of test workpieces is rather suitable for final acceptance tests or for \nthe optimization of manufacturing processes for large batch sizes but not for a fast validation \nof motion accuracy. \n \nFig. 2. Examples of test workpieces for the evaluation of the motion behaviour of NC machine tools \nDBBs are used as measuring devices for various tasks. Besides their main application \nfor circular tests according to ISO  230-4 [1] for the evaluation of pair s of feed -axes using \ncircular paths , DBBs are also used for the calibration of rotary axes in five -axis machine \ntools [5], for the assessment of elasto-static or thermal behaviour of machine tools [9–11] or \nfor the kinematic calibration of non -linear kinematic structures like parallel kinematic \nmachines (PKM) [12] or industrial robots (IR). \nDBB measurements fulfil nearly all of the requirements for fast performance tes ts. \nHowever, they lack a representative coverage of the workspace in up to 6 DOF, so far. But, \nby enlarging the measuring range and using volumetric measuring paths this obstacle can be \novercome. To derive the idea of an enhanced DBB design  and of the proposed measuring \napproach, the general design of a DBB, its basic measuring principle and relevant \nconsequences are summarized  in Section 2 first. The design of an inexpensive DBB device \nwith enhanced measuring range is depicted in Section 3. Compara tive investigations on  \nthe measuring accuracy and repeatability of the developed DBB are shown  in Section 4. \nChallenges and approaches for the design of volumetric m easuring paths are outlined in \nSection 5, while Section 6 shows advantages of 6 DOF measuring paths with results of DBB \nmeasurements. Section 7 finally closes the article with a summary and outlook. \n\n48  B. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 \n \n \n2. TOWARDS A DBB BASED MEASUREMENT OF VOLUMETRIC ACCURACY \nThe idea of the DBB is not new. First papers [13] and already expired patents [14, 15] \ndate back to 1982. A DBB is a specific measuring device made of a telescopic “bar” that \nmechanically connects two balls at its ends and contains a linear position sensor ( Fig. ). The \nballs are made of ferro-magnetic material (steel) and are attached magnetically into a specific \nthree-point fixture, each ( Fig. 3, right). These magnetic fixtures enable an easy attachment \nand detachment of the balls with a very good repeatabil ity of the ball center position. Each \nball in its fixture makes up a ball-and-socket joint with (ideally) constant center position and \n3 rotational DOF. Depending on the ball quality the uncertainty of a ball center position in its \nfixture is very low, e.g. below 1µm for precision balls of grade  G5. One fixture is mounted \non the base or table of the machine tool, for the so -called fixed ball, while anoth er one is \nmounted on a tool holder in the machine tool’s spindle, for the so-called “moved ball”. \n \nFig. 3. Double-Ballbar (Renishaw QC10) with magnetic three-point fixtures \nThe measuring principle of the DBB is quite simple. The balls are either positione d or \nmoved relative to each other. This is usually carried out by a controlled motion of the machine \ntool and requires the balls in their sockets to act as spherical joints. The nominal ball positions \nare specified in the motion command or the NC program.  In an ideal machine tool the actual \nball distance would correspond to the distance of the nominal ball positions. However, this is \nnot possible in reality [9], since t he machine tool’s assemblies always carry out a relative \nmotion in 6 DOF, regardless of t he number of feed -axes involved [16]. Hence, the actual \ndistance will always deviate from the nominal one, and the distance change is recognized and \nmeasurable by the DBB. Depending on the sensor system, measuring resolutions of below \n1 µm and measuring accuracies of around 1µm are typical in this context. \nA single DBB measuring values is the translational part of the 6 DOF motion error at  \nthe according ball positions that act s along the respective measuring direction, which is \nspanned by the connecting line of the ball’s centers. This way, a DBB projects the motion \nerror from the 6-dimensional space onto a 1 -dimensional subspace , which implies a loss  \nof information about the motion error. In the literature, this aspect is also named “partial pose \nmeasurement”. \nHowever, DBB measurements can be seen equivalent to the machining of a spherical \ntest workpiece by 3 to 6 -axis-milling with a ball -end mill (Fig. 4). Here also only 1 out of \n\nB. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 49 \n \n \n6 DOF of the motion error  causes manufacturing errors at the workpiece, namely the one in \nthe respective normal direction of the milled surface of the workpiece. This means an \nequivalent loss of information about the motion error, which generally also occurs on other \nworkpiece shapes in 5 -axis machining, e.g. the te st workpieces in  Fig. 2. Nevertheless, \ncompared to the machining of test workpieces, DBB measurements can be carried out faster, \nno additional material is needed, less collisions or axis limits occur, less error effects influence \nthe measu-rements (e.g. process loads, tool deflection, tool wear or coolant and chips) and no \nadditional survey of the actual workpiece geometry after machining is needed. Moreover, \ndepending on the DBB measuring range, workspace areas of more complex geometry than \ncircles or spheres can be evaluated with a DBB , e.g. linear, prismatic or edged features  \n(see also Fig. 2). \n    \nFig. 4. DBB measurements (left) and equivalent machining of a spherical workpiece with a ball-end mill (right) \nAlthough a single DBB value only conta ins information about the motion error at the \nrespective pose (position and orientation) in the workspace, it is still possible to derive \nstatements about motion error characteristics in a larger workspace area by combining many \nmeasuring values at different measuring poses and directions, respectively. With regard to the \nsphere-shaped workpiece in Fig. 4, this is equivalent to the evaluation of manufacturing errors \nat multiple surface  points (e.g. using a touch probe, a CMM or a 3D scan). Depending on  \nthe distribution of the measuring poses, integral statements about the covered workspace area \nare derivable, e.g. based on minimal, maximal or average measured values. For the evaluation  \nof motion accuracy, this will deliver practicable statements, since the extreme values of the \nmotion errors inside a particular workspace volume are of major interest here, whereas their \nspecific location often is of minor or even no relevance. In this context, the statements derived \nfrom DBB measurements are of rather integral and qualitative nature. \nIn the literature essentially three different variants to carry out DBB measurements are \nmentioned. A first variant is to move to a measuring pose, stop there, attach the DBB, acquire \nthe measur ing value, detach the DBB, and repeat this procedure successively at further \nmeasuring poses, e.g. [17]. This way, the poses either are connected successively by arbitrary \npaths or are represented by multiple balls in specific measuring artifacts. However, due to \nextensive manual interaction and a long measuring duration, this is only acceptable for a few \nposes. \nA second, more advanced variant is to attach the DBB at only the first pose and detach \nit after the last one, and connect the single poses successively by circular arcs with constant \nradius around the fixed ball, e.g. [3]. In this way, the DBB can stay attached during the whole \n\n50  B. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 \n \n \nmeasurement and manual interactions are reduc ed to a minimum, but the connection paths \nare no longer arbitrary.  \nFor both variants, the measured values are uniquely assigned to their measuring poses , \nsince the motion is stopped for data capturing. However , for many measuring poses,  \nthe measuring dur ation is still high. Consequently, the third variant is to connect  \nthe measuring pos es with a continuous motion path and to capture the measur ing values \ncontinuously while moving (p referably with a high sampling rate  of e.g. 250 Hz) without \nstopping. This way, many measuring values are recorded in a short time at many poses with \na high positional resolution . Depending on the measuring path length and speed, short \nmeasuring durations (minutes or even seconds), combined with a large number of measuring \nvalues (more than 1 0,000 samples per minute) are possible.  As a result , the measuring \nduration is reduced to a minimum. For this reason , the third variant is preferred for fast \nperformance tests, e.g. the one proposed here.  \nHowever, the captured DBB values are now uniquely assigned to their sampling time. \nInstead, an assignment to their respective pose of the measuring path is needed, which is far \nmore challenging and requires additional measures.  One of these measures is to use  \na measuring motio n with constant speed and to guess the measuring pose s based on  \nthe sampling times of the measured values. This approach is used in circular tests according \nto ISO 230-4. However, in practice the feed-axes are accelerated and decelerated nevertheless. \nThus, the measuring speed must be low and additional leading and trailing motions are \nrequired. Alternatively, one could sample the actual positions of the feed-axes synchronously \nin addition and predict the measuring poses based on the sampling time of the actual positions \nand a forward kinematic model. This way, measuring speed can be increased and measuring \nduration reduced. However, adequate access to the actual axis pos itions must be available in \nthe control with high sampling rates according to the DBB. Furthermore, if DBB values and \nactual positions are captured by different systems (e.g., DBB controller and NC control), both \nmeasuring series may have different time of fsets and scales, which have to be synchronized \nafterwards. An approach to solve this synchronization problem is explained in [4]. \nDue to the arrangement of the fixed  and moved ball at the spindle and table of the \nmachine tool, respectively, DBB measurements are affected by all influences on the motion \nbehavior of assemblies and components  that are located in  the kinematic chain between  \nthe two balls. The measuring values contain the superimposed effect of all accuracy relevant \ninfluences at the TCP that are currently effective  [9]. This mainly includes influences due to \ngeometrical and kinematic errors of the feed-axes and their guidings as well as of the machine \ntool assemblies. In addition, there are also influences due to position -dependent static \ndeformations resulting from displ aced dead weights. The effect due to these influences \ndepends on the measuring poses and the feed-axes involved. There are also inertia influences \ndue to acceleration and deceleration of machine tool assemblies as well as influences due to \nservo lag in the control loops of the feed-axes. The effect of these influences can be minimized \nby smooth and jerk-limited measuring motions as well as by feed-forward control. Depending \non the previous usage of the machine, thermal influences can also be effective. Thes e \ninfluences can be minimized by a short measuring duration, which is an advantage  \nof continuous DBB measurements. Usually there are no influences due to static or dynamic \nprocess loads, even though there is considerable research addressing this aspect [10, 11, 18]. \nB. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 51 \n \n \nDBB measurements can only assess the influence of feed -axes that are involved in  \nthe measuring procedure. For circular  tests according to ISO  230-4 [1] on serial kinematic \nmachine tools, usually only two feed -axes are interpolated simultaneously, since the measu-\nring path is a planar circle . This can provide sufficient assessment results for 2 or 2.5-axis \nmachining, but is rather limited for the assessment of machining with 5 or 6-axis motions. In \ngeneral, for a meaningful assessment , all axes that are interpolated simultaneously during \nmachining should be interpolated simultaneously during a DBB measurement as well . This \naspect is of particular relevance, if serial kinematic machine tools are compared to parallel \nkinematic machines or industrial robots, which usually always have to interpolate all feed -\naxes simultaneously, even when generating a 1-dimensional linear motion of the end effector. \nThere is an 3D enhancement of the ISO 230-4, which not only uses a circle in the XY plane, \nbut also planar circular arcs in the XZ and YZ planes, respectively [19]. Meanwhile, this \nenhancement is also commercially available as “volumetric circularity test”. Herein, \nmeasuring movements are extended to the third dimension ( Z), but they are still planar. That \nis, the assessment results of such DBB measurements are still limited to 2–3 feed-axes. \nAlthough not considered yet in ISO 230-4 so far, the DBB allows for measuring motions \nin up to 6 DOF and, thus, for more meaningful assessment results, especia lly for 5 or 6 axis \nmachining scenarios. On the one hand, the moved ball can be moved around the fixed ball in \n3 translational DOF. This results in a possible measuring volume in a sphere shape, whereas \nits minimum and maximum radius depend on the measuring radius and range of the DBB. On \nthe other hand, rotations around the cent er of the moved ball in up to 3 additional DOF are \npossible, as well, which enhances the measuring volume up to 6 DOF. It is bound by the limits \nof the feed-axes, by collision conditions of the measur ing setup, and, in case of parallel \nkinematic machines, by the limits of passive joints as well as singular configurations. These \naspects determine the design of volumetric DBB measuring paths. More on this in Section 5. \n3. DESIGN OF A DBB SYSTEM WITH ENHANCED MEASURING RANGE \nTo carry out DBB measurements in up to 6 DOF, the DBB device must meet some \nrequirements. The measuring accuracy must be better than the motion accuracy to be \nevaluated. Thus, a measuring accuracy of a round 1 µm or below is targeted. Accordingly,  \nthe sensor resolution should be one magnitude higher than the measuring accuracy, hence,  \na sensor resolution of 0.1 µm is targeted. Both requirements imply, that neither clearance nor \nrelevant friction is acc eptable in the mechanical parts of the DBB device. Further on,  \nthe sensor signals must not be disturbed, and, to minimize Abbe’s error, the sensor has to be \nplaced at the connecting line of the ball centers. \nDepending on the particular measuring scenario,  the measuring range should be large, \nif possible. Although there are scenarios, which might be satisfied with a measuring range of \nsome ± 0.1 mm, there is a lot of scenarios requiring a measuring range of more than ± 1 mm. \nAmong them are 6 DOF measuring paths, where superimposed motion errors are larger than \nthe motion errors of a single feed -axis, or the automation of complete measuring cycles, \nincluding attachment and detachment of the DBB equipment in the machine, when it is \nadvantageous to have some reserve in measuring range. The same applies to DBB measuring \n52  B. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 \n \n \npaths with positions of non -constant nominal radius or even to different DBB applications, \ne.g. referencing of tools and workpieces [20]. Thus, in this project measuring ranges of up to \n220 mm have been targeted. \nFor use in a production environment, the DBB device must be robust, small and \nlightweight and have a low sensitivity to temperature changes. For data capturing the device \nmust be easily connectable to a PC or the NC control. Therefore, com mon data interfaces as \nwell as appropriate transfer protocols  should be provided. Sampling rates of up to the inter -\npolation cycle time (1000 Hz or above) should be possible. \nAlthough DBB measurements are advantageous compared to other evaluation methods, \nthere are only few providers of DBB devices in the market. The devices sold so far are prima-\nrily developed for measurements according to ISO  230-4 and, hence, do not fulfil all  \nthe requirements named above. Thus, to be able to investigate possibilities a nd limits  \nof 6 DOF DBB measurements, an enhanced DBB was developed at the IMD of the TU \nDresden (Fig. 5). \n \nFig. 5. DBB device with enhanced measuring range, developed at the IMD of the TU Dresden  \nThe core part of the developed DBB device is a linear measuring system that works as \nan incremental encoder with contactless optical scan. It consists of mainly two components: \na miniature sensor head and a scale tape (Fig. 5, top left). The scale tape has a grating period \nof 20 µm, which is interpolat ed 50 times and additionally evaluated 4 times in the counter. \nThis gives a measuring resolution of 0.1 µm per increment, while the accuracy of the scale \ntape is given as 1  µm by the manufacturer. The sensor head is already confectioned with  \na signal cable and a plug and provides integrated signal conditioning. Outside the sensor head \ndifferential signals are transferred, so that signal distortions are minimized. From the pins  \nof the plug digital incremental encoder signals can be connected to a suitable counter module. \nThe relative motion of both DBB components require a precise guiding. For that, a linear \nguideway of miniature type with roller bearings has been chosen. The scale tape is fixed at \nthe rail of this guideway by a specific adhesive, while the  sensor head is mounted into  \na carriage adapter, that is glued onto the carriage itself. The properties of this guiding have \nbeen investigated for various carriages with different length as well as bearing preload. \n\nB. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 53 \n \n \nA ball adapter connects one rail end to one of the balls, while a carbon fiber tube with  \na fixture adapter connects the carriage adapter with the magnetic fixture at the other end  \nof the DBB device. All adapters are made of Invar® steel (1.3912, Alloy  36). Compared to \nconventional steel, it is  nearly 10 times less sensitive to temperature changes. The same is \nsaid for the carbon fiber tube, which enables a lightweight design and flexible choice of DBB \nlength. \nDBB devices with different measuring ranges from 14  mm up to 220  mm have been \nbuild and investigated at the IMD of the TU Dresden. Different extension adapters allow for \nan adjustment of the DBB measuring length, e.g. in steps of 50  mm. By using a particular \ncalibration tool that is made of thermally insensitive material (Zerodur®) and provides \naccurately known reference lengths  (Fig. 6), it is also possible to capture absolute distance \nvalues with the DBB. The scale tape contains an additional reference mark, which can be \naccurately detected by the sensor head, hence, the calibratio n tool is needed only once, to \nprecisely determine the zero offset of the scale tape. \n \nFig. 6. Calibration tool for absolute radius DBB measurements (Renishaw GmbH)  \nTwo different data interfaces have been provided for data capturing. The first one allows \nfor stand-alone measurements, independent of the machine or control. The DBB is connected \nto a micro-controller box (Fig. 7, top), developed at the IMD of the TU Dresden. In this box \nthe encoder signals are hardware -counted by an incr emental counter chip (up to 32 MHz), \nprepared to specific data telegrams ( Fig. 7, bottom) and transfered cyclically as a serial data \nstream to a PC. The PC is connected per USB interface,  which also supplies the power for  \nthe microcontroller and the sensor. Hence, no additional power supply or batteries are needed. \nTwo types of cyclic data telegrams are selectable. A short telegramm of 6 Bytes contains \nthe actual measuring value with a resolution of 0.1 µm (4 Bytes), the actual state of the sensor \nsystem ( 8 Bits) and a CRC checksum (8 Bits). A long telegram of 10 Bytes additionally \nprovides a time stamp with a resolution of 50  µs (4 Bytes) for every measuring value. At  \nthe PC side the box is recognized as a virtual serial UART device and can be accessed us ing \nstandard UART libraries with baud rates of up to 1 Mbit/s. The box can be controlled and \nconfigured over serial interface by a set of control commands. Depending on the data process-\ning at the PC side, stable sampling rates of up to 5 kHz are possible in practice. \nThe second interface allows for control integrated measurements. The DBB device is \nconnected directly to the NC control via a real -time capable fieldbus interface. Fig. 8 \nexemplarily shows the control integration of the DBB for a TwinCAT -based NC control  \nof Beckhoff. Here an EtherCAT bus coupler (EK1100) and an incremental counter interface \n\n54  B. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 \n \n \n(EL5101), which also provides the power for the sensor head, were used. This solution \nallowed for a synchronous sampling of DBB data and actual axis positi ons in interpolation \ncycle times of 1  ms and below. In contrast to the standalone -solution above, no additional \ndata processing due to timing deviations is necessary. However, an according incremental \nencoder interface needs to be available for the control  system at hand and, the control must \nprovide suitable functionality for data capturing, logging and streaming. \n \nFig. 7. Data interface for serial USB connection to a PC (above) with provided data protocols (below) \n \nFig. 8. Data interface of the DBB for integration into a NC control on the example of a Beckhoff TwinCAT system \n4. INVESTIGATION OF MEASURING ACCURACY OF THE DBB \nThe accuracy of DBB device is an essential prerequisite for reliable DBB measurements. \nTo investigate the measuring accuracy of different DBB designs, a specific testbed was used  \n(Fig. 9). It contains the DBB device to be investigated ( Fig. 9, left), a linear feed -axis with  \na motion range of 230  mm (Fig. 9, center) and a 1D laser interferometer (LI) as re ference \nsystem (Fig. 9, right). The feed -axis includes a slide with two rail guidways. It is driven by  \na servo motor (Beckhoff) over a toothed belt and a ball screw. The servo motor is controlled \nby a TwinCAT control system. The moved ball fixture and the LI reflector mirror are mounted \non the slide. During setup of the test bed, the laser beam is aligned to run through the centers \nof the fixed and moved ball in their magnetic fixtures, which renders Abbe’s error negligible. \n\nB. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 55 \n \n \n \nFig. 9. Test setup for experimental investigation of the measuring accuracy of the DBB system  \nThe measuring procedure for the investigation of the DBB’s measuring accuracy was \nmade up of 5 repeated measuring cycles, which ensure a statistical relevance of the measure-\nments and allow for the adjustment of unavoidable thermal effects from measuring data. Each \ncycle consisted of an intermittent forward and backward motion of the slide over the whole \nmeasuring range with around 75 to 150 equi distant steps each, depending on the measuring \nrange. At each single step the motion was stopped for capturing the current measuring value \nof DBB and LI, respectively. Data capturing was triggered, when the current measuring value \nremained inside a change window of +/- 0.1 µm for a certain time of at least 0.7  s. Thereby, \ndisturbing effects due to mechanical vibrations or control loop influences were minimized \nand the measured values of the DBB and LI, respectively, can be associated to one and  \nthe same physical slide position. \nDepending on the measuring range, step count and step pause time, a measuring \nprocedure of 5 cycles took between 20 and 55 minutes. In view of the low measuring \nresolution of 0.1  µm, thermal effects due to temperature changes during this time are not \nnegligible. They were recognized as a drift of the raw DBB error of up to several µm over  \nthe 5 cycles. Fig. 10 (red) shows this effect on the example of a measuring range of 2 mm and \nfor all in all 790 measuring steps. However, these th ermal effects can be removed from   \nthe measurements afterwards. \n \nFig. 10. Thermal adjustment of the DBB error using 6 (out of 790) measuring values \nFor this purpose, 6 specific raw DBB error values that belong to the same measuring \nposition and motion direction were fitted by a PT1 function, namely the measuring values in \nthe start positions of each of the 5 cycles and the measuring value after the la st reverse step \n\n56  B. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 \n \n \n(Fig. 10, red circles). The fitted PT1 function was then used for the thermal correction for all \nmeasured values, according to their respective capturing times. This results in the thermally \nadjusted DBB error ( Fig. 10, blue). By relating i t to the corresponding measuring positions, \nthe scaling, linearity and mean variation can also be examined. \n \nFig. 11. Linearity, scaling and mean variation of the thermally adjusted DBB error over the measured range (2  mm) \nFigure 11 (blue) shows the according plot for all 5 cycles of the example from  Fig. 10. \nIdeally, the values should be arranged close to the horizontal zero line (Fig 11, black). Instead, \na significant scaling of around 2.5  µm/mm can be seen. Fitting a line throu gh all the data \n(Fig. 11, dashed red) shows a quite good linearity of the DBB error, wheras the slope of the \nfitted line is the scale factor for the DBB sensor system. After scaling, which is equivalent to \nthe difference of the thermally adjusted DBB error to the fitted line, the remaining DBB error \nresults, which, for the example of Fig. 10, is shown in Fig. 12. \nThese investigations have been made for DBB designs with different measuring ranges \n(2...150 mm), carriage preloads (ZF, Z0, Z1) and 2 carriage lengths (contact lengths of 20 or \n30 mm). In general, the carriages with zero preload (Z0) showed the best (resp. lowest) mean \nvariations and the best linearity. Although preloaded carriages (Z1) improve the repeatability \nof the DBB error, they generate significant hysteresis due to the greater friction. The opposite \nholds for carriages with clearance ( ZF). Furthermore, longer carriages (30  mm) resulted in \nbetter results compared to short ones (20  mm), even though the difference is only small and  \nrather relevant for larger measuring ranges. \n \nFig. 12. Remaining DBB error after adjustment and scaling of the measurements over the measured range (2  mm) \nAn additional measurement was made to compare to a commercially available DBB \nwith a measuring range of 2 mm. Fig. 13 shows exemplary results for a DBB design with up \n\nB. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 57 \n \n \nto 43 mm measuring range and a large carriage of zero preload as well as for a DBB design \nwith up to153 mm measuring range and a short carriage of zero preload. The comparison was \nmade for strokes of 2 mm and 5 mm, respectively, in the middle of the respective measuring \nrange. The results in Fig. 13 show the high accuracy of the developed DBB device, which is \nquite comparable to the commercial system. Even with a larger measuring range of 5  mm,  \nthe resulting DBB error always remains below 1 µm. \n \nFig. 13. Exemplary results of the experimental evaluation of measuring accuracy for strokes of 2 and 5 mm,  \ncompared to a commercial DBB device (above) \nThe accuracy achieved with the developed DBB device is mainly based on the accuracy \nof the incremental sensor system used. Thermal effects obviously have a considerable \ninfluence. To achieve a higher measuring accuracy either the thermal conditions during  \nthe measurements must be kept as constant as possible or additional temperature information \nshould be captured during the measurement and taken into account. While the former can be \nrealized to only a limited extent in practice under shop floor conditions, the latter is associated \nwith a further development of the DBB and the post-processing of raw measuring data. \nThe results show, that the developed DBB device meets the accuracy requirements for \nthe assessment of NC machines outlined at the beginning of Section 3. The design is robust \nand suitable for measurements under shop floor conditions. Material costs including the cont-\nroller box remained in a range of about 1000 Euro. Thus, it can be considered to be quite \ninexpensive compared to other commercially available measuring devices that can provide  \na similar measuring range, accuracy and resolution. \n5. DESIGN OF VOLUMETRIC MEASURING PATHS \nIn contrast to simple planar circles measuring paths with 6 DOF have a greater \ncomplexity due to the additional DOF’s, and more complex requirements that have to be met. \n\n58  B. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 \n \n \nPrimarily, a majority of the error components of the machine tool should be actually effective \non the measuring path. Thus, one of the most inaccura te motion paths is searched for .  \nIn addition, the measuring path must: \n– be continuous in all 6 DOF in order to facilitate quick measurements of short duration, \n– take into account all motion limits and collision conditions,  \n– be formulated as a valid NC program for the particular NC control at hand.  \nFurthermore, it should be jerk -limited to avoid unwanted excitation of the machine \nstructure during DBB measurements, unless this effect is to be explicitly analysed. \nTo find a suitable 6 DOF DBB measuring path the following method was developed, \nbased on the four-step approach according to Fig. 14. Mathematical details of this approach \nhave been already published in [21] and are left out here, for this reason. \n \nFig. 14. Generation of a suitable 6D path with constant nominal radius for DBB measurements  \n5.1. GENERATION OF A DISCRETE SET OF SENSITIVE POSES \nA set of discrete 6 DOF poses in the workspace is generated, that reach an extremal \nvalue for a specific evaluation criterion depending on kinematic structure a nd evaluation \nscenario. A typical example of such a criterion is the sensitivity of DBB values to single \nkinematic error sources, which holds for the most or least accurate poses in the workspace \nunder consideration (e.g. covered by a sphere). Other criteria could be tailored to specific \nmanufacturing tasks, e.g. considering particular error sources or orientational errors only. \nTo do this, a simulation model is required as a prerequisite, that contains the kinematic \nstructure including all relevant error sources and calculates the corresponding DBB measuring \nvalue depending on a pose in the workspace and the error values. Based on this, a stochastic \noptimization procedure was developed. It defines the criteria to be considered in its objective \nfunction. In addition, motion limits of feed -axes and passive joints (in case of parallel \nkinematics) must not be exceeded by any of  the poses. Collisions of the DBB and machine \ncomponents and singularities have to be avoided in the measuring path as well. These aspects \nare regarded by according penalty functions, extending the objective function. \nIn principle, the number of discrete p oses can be chosen freely. On the one hand, it \nshould be a large number for a good quality of the measuring path. On the other hand,  \n the more poses are used the more calculation time is required and the measuring path \nbecomes more complex and possibly lon ger. Although the optimal choice of the number  \n\nB. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 59 \n \n \nof poses requires further investigation, promising results have been achieved so far if  \nthe number of poses corresponded at least the number of single error sources or higher. \n5.2. REORDERING OF SEQUENCE OF POSES FOR A SHORT PATH \nFor a continuous motion the discrete poses have to be connected to form a measuring \npath. In order to achieve a possibly short path length and motion duration, respectively,  \nthe poses need to be sorted appropriately. To do this, a “Traveling Salesman Problem” (TSP) \nmust be solved. The “Concorde TSP Solver” tool was used for this, which is freely available \nin the internet  [22]. Besides the path length also the feasibility and the collision conditions  \nof the intermediate poses on the connection paths were considered in the TSP’s cost matrix.  \n5.3. SMOOTH CONNECTION OF TRANSLATIONAL POSE PARTS \nThe resulting translational path of step 2 is a spherical polygon that has kinks at  \nthe single poses. This would lead to discontinuous motions with speed reduction at these \nposes. Therefore, a smooth path is generated, which leads through every single pose and runs \nC1-steadily (without discontinuity in speed) in the translatory components. For this, the trans-\nlational tangents at each pose are determined and optimized, so that the resulting path lies \ncompletely in the upper hemisphere, to avoid any possible collision between moving ball and \nmachine table. \n5.4. OPTIMIZATION OF POSE ORIENTATIONS FOR MINIMUM AXIS JERKS  \nAfterwards the orientational components of the poses are calculated. For this purpose,  \na larger number of poses of around 1 mm distance is interpolated from the smoothed path  \nof step  3, whereas the orientations of the intermediate poses are initially calculated b y \nspherical linear interpolation [23] using a sinusoidal interpolation parameter. For each of these \nposes the orientation is then varied by a stochastic optimization method. The objective \nfunction was designed for minimizing the maximal occurring jerks of the feed-axes, while  \nthe feasibility and collision conditions have been considered by additional penalties. \nBased on the poses obtained from these four steps, finally an NC program can be \ngenerated, usually in G-Code format according to DIN 66025/ISO 6983. As a sequence of G1 \nblocks the poses form polygon vertices or spline nodes, depending on the supported \nfunctionality of the NC control type at hand. Even though G -Code is standardized  [24], \ncontrol-specific dialects of G-Code are also common, which must be taken into account when \ngenerating the NC programs. The whole measuring procedure can be further automated with \nadditional motion sequences in the NC program for the setup of the fixed ball and the DBB \nin the machine. \nThe algorithms used in the four steps have been implemented in python to be universally \napplicable. However, some machine specific informations have to be provided, additionally: \nan appropriate kinematic model, kinematic as well as dynamic limits of feed-axes and passive \njoints (in case of parallel kinematics), collision conditions in the machine workspace and  \nthe NC control type. \n60  B. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 \n \n \n6. MEASUREMENT RESULTS \nOn the example of a hexapod in the test field of the IMD at the TU Dresden, three \ndifferent DBB measuring paths were examined in view of the derivable statements. The mea-\nsuring paths were: \n– a planar circular path (2D) in the XY plane, \n– a suboptimal 6D measuring path from [12] with only small orientation angle values,  \n– a 6D measuring path optimized with the developed method. \nThe measuring radius was 300  mm in each case. The measurements were carried out \none after another, so that the error state of the machine was essentially identical for the three \npaths. The results are shown in Fig. 15: \n \nFig. 15. DBB measurements at one and the same machine with different measuring paths of R= 300 mm \nUsing the difference between the span of the DBB valu es as a comparison criterion, it \nranges from 0.2268 mm for the 2D circular path, over 0.5863 mm for the suboptimal path to \n2.3153 mm for the optimized path. Related to the planar circular path, this is an increase by \nfactor 2.6 for the suboptimal and by fa ctor 10.2 for the optimized path. More extended \nstatements can be derived by means of a Fourier analysis of the DBB values, see Fig. 16: \n \nFig. 16. Amplitude distribution of Fourier coefficients of the DBB values for the 3 different measuring paths \n\nB. Kauschinger et al./Journal of Machine Engineering, 2020, Vol. 20, No. 3, 44–62 61 \n \n \nThe level of the amplitudes and the number of Fourier coefficients with amplitudes \nabove a certain limit can be interpreted as a measure of information content (entropy) of the \nDBB values. In comparison to the other measuring paths, the optimized measuring path here \nshows significantly higher amplitudes in more Fourier coefficients. Hence, it provides more \ninformation about motion errors and is more sensitive to it. \n7. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK \nThe paper presents an alternative approach for the evaluation of the volumetric motion \naccuracy of machine tools by using a cost -efficient Double -Ballbar and optimized 6 DOF \nmeasuring paths. It is particularly suitable for measurements in an operational sta te of the \nmachine, under shop floor conditions and with minimum machine downtime of up to only \nsome minutes. Hence, fast performance tests of the volumetric accuracy can be carried out \neasily and more frequently in operational pauses, which allows an econo mical accuracy \nmonitoring by comparing the measured values to a reference state of the machine tool at short \nintervals. \nThe design of a DBB system with enhanced measuring range of up to 220 mm and two \ndifferent interfaces for stand -alone and control integr ated data acquisition was explained.  \nThe experimental setup and the measuring procedure for the analysis of the measuring \naccuracy of the developed DBB was shown. Depending on the measuring stroke,  \nthe developed DBB can reach an accuracy of 1  µm as well as a repeatability of below 1 µm, \nwhich is comparable to DBB systems available in the market, although there are only few \nproviders, so far. \nFurthermore, a design method for optimized 6  DOF measuring paths, based on a four -\nstep approach, was outlined. Due to the greater complexity of the design problem, an efficient \ngeneration of NC programs for volumetric DBB measurements requires suitable software  \nsupport. The algorithms have been implemented in python. Potentials of optimized 6  DOF \nmeasuring paths have been demonstrated on the example of 3 measuring paths of different \ndimension and complexity. Compared to the other paths, the optimized 6 DOF measuring \npath showed significantly better results in view to sensitivity and information content  of the \nDBB values measured along this path. \nFurther research is advisable in view to a more efficient generation of 6 DOF measuring \npaths, to the considering of additional kinematic structures, to an efficient automation and \ncross-check of the whole measuring procedure, to the design of tailored measuring paths for \nspecific statements (e.g. the feasibility for specific machining tasks) or even to the identifica-\ntion of particular error parameters and kinematic calibration procedures, respectively. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors want to thank the German Research Foundation (DFG) for their kind support in the project IH 124/3-1 with \nthe title “Measurement and evaluation of the volumetric accuracy of mult i-axis machine tools under operational \nconditions”. \n62  B.
