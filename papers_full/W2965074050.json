  "abstract": "Vibration analysis is one of the important tools for the transformer winding faults diagnosis. Previous researchers have proved that the vibration spatial distribution of the winding is significantly influenced by the winding defects for the open circuit condition. In order to study the effects of the loading current on the winding vibrations under different mechanical conditions, experiments were designed and operated on a three-phase transformer winding to analyze the winding vibration distribution under different winding defect cases. Further, to study to what extent the mechanical defects and the loading current influence characteristics of the vibration distribution on the tank, the tank vibration distribution under various winding defects and different loading currents were also measured and discussed. In addition, the possibility of detection of transformer winding faults based on tank vibration spatial distribution characteristics was also discussed.",
