  "abstract": "Liberalization of the energy market drives utilities to a more cost-effective power system. Power transformers are the most complex, important, and critical components of the transition and distribution power systems. Insulation system is the key component of life extension, better availability and higher reliability of a transformer. In order to achieve both decreasing operational cost and reliable service condition-based maintenance is needed. Monitoring and diagnostics methods and techniques, for insulation condition assessment of power transformers, are described. Date base and knowledge rules diagnostics management system, in internet oriented environment, is outlined. .",
