  "abstract": "The increasing complexity of language models naturally demands innovative approaches to maintain internal representational consistency. This paper introduces Dynamic Contextual Alignment Mechanisms, a novel framework designed to enhance semantic coherence within large language models. By integrating adaptive recalibration strategies, the proposed mechanism aligns intermediate representations across multiple layers, thereby reducing contextual ambiguities and improving the interpretative processes of language models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant reductions in perplexity and attention entropy, alongside improvements in coherence scores, indicating the mechanism's efficacy in refining contextual understanding. Comparative analyses reveal that, unlike traditional methods relying on fine-tuning or auxiliary layers, this approach inherently enhances alignment without substantial computational overhead. The findings demonstrate the potential of Dynamic Contextual Alignment Mechanisms to advance the robustness and adaptability of language models across diverse applications, addressing fundamental challenges in representational alignment and setting a foundation for future developments in the field.",
