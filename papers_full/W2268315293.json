I NTRODUCTION\nC\nOMPARED to dc power transmission, dc power distri-\nbution is just graduallygetting researchers’ attention in\nrecent years, and many concepts are still in the exploratory\nstage [1]–[2]. In dc power distribution, recent research mainly\nfocuses on the low-voltage (LV) dc microgrid, and the high-\nvoltage/medium-voltage (HV/MV) distribution grid usually fo-\ncuses on the ac grid [3]–[5]. As for the condition that the HV/MV\ndistribution network is dc transmission grid has seldom touched.\nFor now, the ﬂexible HVDC (VSC-HVDC) transmission is be-\ning rapidly developed, which causes the HV/MV dc distribution\nnetwork become a reality [6]. In this context, the dc distribution\nwill also further promote the development of dc grid and bring\na lot of technical advantages.\nManuscript received June 25, 2015; revised August 23, 2015; accepted\nSeptember 17, 2015.

In fact, in dc distribution, it is difﬁcult to re-\nalize power conversion through simple magnetic transformer as\nwidely used in ac distribution [7]–[8]; it especially needs power\nelectronics technology. In LV applications, dc–dc converters are\nwidely used. Moreover, many literatures discuss isolated bidi-\nrectional dc–dc converters (IBDCs), which are very important\nfor achieving electrical isolation [9]–[12]. These converters can\nbe used to access dc loads, energy storage systems, and dc dis-\ntributed generations in the dc microgrid. However, they fail to\nserve as ever-lasting interfaces between MVDC distribution bus\nand LVDC microgrid.\nIn ac power distribution, solid-state transformer (SST) is a\ngood solution to connect the MV and the LV ac grid through\npower electronic technology [13]–[15]. Krishnamoorthy et al.\n[15] also proposed a solution to power two isolated system with\nmedium-frequency transformer link. However, because the dc\npower distribution concept has only been focused for a short\nperiod of time, the world-wide research regarding SSTs mainly\nfocuses on the ac SST and the concept of dc transformer (DCT) is\nrarely concerned. Moreover, many literatures have investigated\nvarious multiple dc–dc converters to increase the voltage/power\nlevel [16]–[18], primarily focusing on unidirectional dc–dc con-\nverters. The target objects are usually buck/boost circuits or iso-\nlated dc–dc converters (the input bridge is an active-controlled\ninverter and output bridge is a non-controlled rectiﬁer), and the\noutput voltage of these converters is controlled by duty ratio of\nswitches. These types of dc converters cannot meet the appli-\ncation requirements of DCT, such as bidirectional power ﬂow,\nelectrical isolation, high-power application, etc.\nOn this basis, some literatures also discussed multiple IBDCs\nas a DCT [19]–[21]. Three existing IBDC topologies—dual half\nbridge, dual active bridge (DAB), and series resonant converter\n(SRC)—were analyzed and compared in [20], and the resulting\nconclusion was that DAB topology is the most suitable converter\ncell, which can be used as a base cell for DCT. On this baiss, an\nintroduction about the small signal model of the multiple DAB\nwas conducted, but further studies (such as operation principle,\ncontrol, experiments) of the multiple DABs used in DCT were\nnot concerned.\nMoreover, although previous multiple DCT topology (named\nTDCT in this paper) based on DAB can achieve electrical iso-\nlation, voltage conversion and power transfer between MVDC\ndistribution and LVDC microgrid buses, but due the existence\n0885-8993 © 2015 IEEE.

Topology of proposed SCDCT.\nof the concentrated capacitor, the SCDCT cannot disconnect\nfully from MVDC distribution when a short fault occurs in the\ndistribution bus, the dc capacitor will be discharged rapidly and\nthere will be a large overcurrent. When the fault is eliminated,\nthe dc capacitor needs to be recharged, and the fault recov-\nery is slow. Also, the TDCT cannot operate with a redundant\nunit when a submodule fails; otherwise, the dc capacitor of the\nfaulted submodule will be short-circuited, which reduces the\nsystem reliability, especially in MVDC application. In addition,\nbecause circulating power of DAB increases sharply when the\nterminal voltages mismatch with the transformer ratio (it is the\ntechnical bottleneck to hamper the large scale use of DAB),\nthe efﬁciency of TDCT decreases rapidly when the distribution\nvoltage ﬂuctuation occurs.\nIn view of the situation mentioned earlier, this paper pro-\nposes a DCT solution based on switched capacitor (SCDCT)\nto address the aforementioned issues. The number of submod-\nules in an SCDCT can be adjusted according to the voltage and\npower levels, and it is especially suitable for kV- and MW-level\napplications with numerous submodules due to improved fault\ntolerance and reliability. In the paper, the voltage and power\ncharacterization, control strategy, startup and fault solution, and\nexperiments of SCDCT for MVDC distribution applications are\npresented and analyzed comprehensively.\nII. P ROPOSED DCT BA S E DO NASWITCHED CAPACITOR\nThe topology of a proposed SCDCT is shown in Fig. 1. The\nSCDCT is mainly composed of a series switched capacitor in-\nterface (SSCI) and high-frequency link interface (HFLI). The\nSSCI in the paper is different from series switched capacitor\nconverter in previous literatures [22]–[24]. It is composed of N\nhalf-bridge switched capacitor (SC) submodules, thenN discrete\ndc terminals (V11 ,V21 ,...,V N 1) are raised; all the SCs are con-\nnected in series at the ac side to interface the MVDC distribution\ngrid. The HFLI is composed of N DAB submodules, with one\nterminal of DAB connected to the discrete dc terminal of SC and\nthe other connected in parallel to interface the LVDC microgrid.\nCompared to the TDCT scheme, the proposed SCDCT em-\nploys SSCI as interface to the MVDC distribution grid. SSCI\ncan adjust the voltage of the dc discrete terminals to ensure the\nvoltage match between the two sides of the HFL transformer.\nThen the circulating current can be decreased and the current\nimpact and efﬁciency performances can be improved. SCDCT\ncan operate well when some submodules fail, and then the re-\nliability can be improved. In addition, the dc discrete voltages\ncan stay when the MVDC distribution grid fails, and then the\nSCDCT can put into operation quickly when the fault is elimi-\nnated. In addition, all modules are connected in parallel on the\nLV side. When a submodule fails, we just need to close the\ndriving pulses of all the switches. The LV side of an SCDCT\ncan operate normally.\nIII. M AIN CHARACTERIZATION OF SCDCT FOR MVDC\nDISTRIBUTION\nA. Switching Characterization\nIn SSCI, the two switches Qi1 and Qi2 are switched alter-\nnately and the switching states of the switches in the same\nposition of all the SC submodules are the same, as shown in\n4768 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 31, NO. 7, JULY 2016\nFig. 2. Operation waveforms of SCDCT. (a) SSCI. (b) HFLI.\nFig. 2. During the steady state, the SSCI can be divided into\nfour modes, as follows:\n1) Interval t0 − t1: Qi1 is turned off and Qi2 is turned on,\nand the inductor current iL is negative. Then iL ﬂows\nacross Di2, and the voltage across L is VHV . The current\niL decreases in the negative direction until iL =0 at t1.\n2) Interval t1 − t2: Qi1 is still turned off and Qi2 is still\nturned on, but the inductor current iL is changed from\nnegative to positive. Then iL ﬂows across from Di2 to\nQi2, and the voltage across L is still VHV ; the current iL\nincreases in the positive direction until iL achieves the\nmaximum value Imax at t2.\n3) Interval t2 − t3:A t t2, Qi1 is still turned on and Qi2 is\nstill turned off, and the inductor current iL is positive.\nThen iL ﬂows across Di1, and the voltage across L is\nVHV − ∑ Vi1; the current iL decreases in the positive\ndirection until iL =0 at t3.\n4) Interval t3 − t4: Qi1 is still turned on, and Qi2 is still\nturned off, but the inductor current iL is changed from\npositive to negative. TheniL ﬂows across fromDi1 to Qi1,\nand the voltage across L is still VHV − ∑ Vi1; the current\niL increases in the negative direction untiliL achieves the\nminimum value Imin at t4.\nIn the aforementioned analysis, the inductor current iL can\nbe positive or negative, that is, Imin < 0 <I max ; then SSCI\nhas four switching modes. However, the SSCI just has two\nswitching modes 2) and 3) when 0 ≤ Imin ≤ Imax and two\nswitching modes 1) and 4) when Imin ≤ Imax ≤ 0.\nIn HFLI, the switching states of Si1, Si3, Si5 and Si7 are\ncomplementary with Si2, Si4, Si6 and Si8, respectively; the\nswitching states of Si1, Si3, Si5, and Si7 are the same with\nSi4, Si2, Si8, and Si6, respectively; the switching states of the\nswitches in the same position of all the DAB submodules are the\nsame. In the steady state, HFLI can be divided into six modes,\nwhich have been analyzed in [25].\nB. Voltage and Power Characterization\nAccording to the aforementioned analysis, the average volt-\nage of L during one period can be derived as follows:\nVL = 1\nT\n∫ t4\nt0\nvL dt = VHV −\n∑\ni=1 ∼N\n(1 − Di)Vi1 (1)\nwhere Di =( t2 − t0)/T is deﬁned as the duty ratio andT is the\nswitching period of SSCI.\nWhen all the duty ratios are the same, the average voltage of\nthe inductor L over one period should be zero during the steady\nstate. From (1), we have\nVcaver =\n∑ N\ni=1 Vi1\nN = VHV\nN(1 − D) (2)\nwhere Vcaver is the average value of all the dc discrete voltages\nof SSCI, and D = D1 = D2 = ... = DN .\nFrom (2), the capacitor voltage of SC can be adjusted by\nadjusting the duty ratio D.D u et o 0 ≤ D< 1, thus VCaver ≥\nVHV /N. In addition, the average value of iL and ii1 over one\nswitching period also can be derived\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩\nIL = 1\nT\n∫ t4\nt0\niL dt = Imax + Imin\n2\nIi1 = 1\nT\n∫ t4\nt2\niL dt = (1 − D)(Imax + Imin )\n2\n. (3)\nIgnoring the power loss, the average power of SSCI is\nP = VHV IHV = VHV IL =\nN∑\ni=1\nVi1Ii1 = (Imax + Imin )VHV\n2 .\n(4)\nFrom (4), P =0 while Imax + Imin =0 , there is no power\nﬂow between SSCI and HFLI; P> 0 while Imax + Imin > 0,\nZHAO et al.: HIGH-FREQUENCY-LINK DC TRANSFORMER BASED ON SCDCT FOR MVDC POWER DISTRIBUTION APPLICATION 4769\nFig. 3. Power characterization of SCDCT.\nthe power ﬂows from SSCI to HFLI; P< 0 while Imax +\nImin < 0, the power ﬂows from HFLI to SSCI.\nFrom Fig. 2(b), each DAB can be equivalent to two ac volt-\nages vhi1 and vhi2 connected to both sides of an inductor; the\nmagnitude and direction of the power can be adjusted by ad-\njusting the magnitude and direction of phase shift (PS) between\nvhi1 and vhi2. The average power of DAB can be derived [25]\nas\nPi = nT Vi1Vi2\n2fsLT\nMi(1 −| Mi|) (5)\nwhere Mi =( t4 − t2)/Ths is deﬁned as the PS ratio, 0 ≤ Mi\n≤ 1;fs =1 /(2Ths ) is the switching frequency; and nT is the\nturns ratio of the transformer.\nFor HFLI, the dc currents at the series side of all the DABs\nare the same and the dc voltages at the parallel side are the same.\nWhen all the PS ratios are the same, we have\nP =\nN∑\ni=1\nPi = nT NVcVLV\n2fsLT\nM(1 −| M|) (6)\nwhere M = M1 = M2 = ... = MN .\nFrom (2) and (6), we have\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎩\nP = nT VHV VLV\n2fsLT\nM(1 −| M|)\n1 − D\nVLV = nT VHV R\n2fsLT\nM(1 −| M|)\n1 − D\n. (7)\nAccording to the aforementioned analysis, the voltage and\npower of SCDCT can be controlled by controlling the duty ratio\nD and the PS ratio M. Fig. 3 shows the power characterization\nof SCDCT. When the PS ratio M> 0, the transmission power\nis positive; when the PS ratio M< 0, the transmission power\nis negative. When |M| < 0.5, the transmission power increases\nwith the increase in | M| and D. It also can be seen that the\nSCDCT has greater transmission power capacity than TDCT\nbecause of employing SSCI.\nIn Fig. 3, p = P/PM is the uniﬁed value of the transmission\npower and the base value PM is given by\nPM = nT VHV VLV\n8fsLT\n(8)\nwhere M =0 .5 and D =0 .\nC. Circulating Current Characterization\nIn HFLI, because the power is transferred by HF square waves\nin every DAB, the circulating current will increase rapidly when\nthe terminal voltages do not match the turns ratio of the trans-\nformer. The circulating current performance of DAB can be\ndescribed by the HFL fundamental power factor, as analyzed\nin [26], and then we have (9) shown at the bottom of the page,\nwhere λTDCT and λSCDCT are the HFL fundamental power\nfactors of TDCT and SCDCT, respectively.\nFor TDCT, in order to ensure the minimum circulating current\nfor the rated state, the transformer turns ratio should match the\nrated conversion ratio of the terminal voltages. For SCDCT, in\norder to ensure the minimum circulating current for all states, the\ntransformer turns ratio can be designed to match the maximum\nconversion ratio of the terminal voltages\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎩\nnT TDCT = VHV N\nNVLV\nnT SCDCT = VHV max\nNVLV\n. (10)\nConsidering the voltage ﬂuctuation of the MVDC distribution\nnetwork, from (9) and (10), we have\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎪⎩\nλTDCT = sin(Mπ )√\n[r − cos(Mπ )]2 +s i n2 (Mπ )\nλSCDCT = sin(Mπ )√\n[(r/rmax )/(1 − D) − cos(Mπ )]2 +s i n2 (Mπ )\n(11)\nwhere r = vHV /VHV N is the ratio of the actual value to the rated\nvalue of the MVDC distribution network. If the ﬂuctuation rate\nis 20%, then 0.8 ≤ r ≤ 1.2= rmax .\nAccording to the aforementioned analysis, Fig. 4 compares\nthe circulating current performance of the TDCT and SCDCT\nwith the same transmission power. It can be seen that the SCDCT\ncan get larger power factor than the TDCT in all the operation\nstates by selecting the appropriate duty ratio of SSCI, and then\nthe circulating current can be decreased and the efﬁciency can\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎪⎩\nλTDCT = nT VLV sin(Mπ)√\n[VHV /N − nT VLV cos(Mπ)]2 +[ nT VLV sin(Mπ)]2\nλSCDCT = nT VLV sin(Mπ)√\n{VHV /[N(1 − D)] − nT VLV cos(Mπ)}2 +[ nT VLV sin(Mπ)]2\n(9)\n4770 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 31, NO. 7, JULY 2016\nFig. 4.

In fact, from [25], with a constant switching fre-\nquency, the conduction and switching losses of DAB are mainly\nrelated to the RMS and peak values of HFL current, respec-\ntively. The decrease in the circulating current will lead to the\ndecrease in the RMS and peak currents, so both the conduction\nand switching losses decrease.\nFrom (11), the power factor of the SCDCT can reach the\nmaximum value when (12) of D reaches the minimum value\nf(D)= | r\nrmax (1 − D) − cos(Mπ)|. (12)\nFor (12), we have\nmin{f(D)} =\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎩\n0, cos(Mπ) ≥ r\nrmax\nr\nrmax\n− cos(Mπ), cos(Mπ) < r\nrmax\n.\n(13)\nFrom (11) to (13), we have (14) is shown at the bottom of the\npage, where\nDopt =\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎩\n1 − r\nrmax cos(Mπ), cos(Mπ) ≥ r\nrmax\n0, cos(Mπ) < r\nrmax\n(15)\nIn Fig. 4, the thick red curves show the maximum value\ndetermined by (14). In fact, the power change caused by the duty\nratio is not considered in (12)–(14), so the power factor in (14)\nis not the absolute maximum value when cos(Mπ) <r / rmax .\nIV . CONTROL CHARACTERIZATION AND DESIGN OF SCDCT\nFOR MVDC DISTRIBUTION\nIn SCDCT, the MVDC voltage is provided by the dc distri-\nbution grid, and the LVDC voltage is controlled by the SCDCT.\nMoreover, the key for SCDCT is to control the voltage bal-\nance of discrete capacitors and current balance of each DAB in\nparallel side for both the forward and reverse power ﬂows.\nA. Self-Balancing Ability\nIn steady state, the average value of the dc discrete voltage is\ncontrolled with a constant value by SSCI and the LVDC voltage\nis controlled with a constant value by HFLI. From (2) to (7),\nD, M, IL , and Ii1 remain constant for a given transmission\npower. From Fig. 1, for SCi and DABi, we have\nIiC 1 = Ii1 − Iif 1. (16)\nAssume that the discrete voltageV11 of SC1 increases and the\ndiscrete voltage V21 of SC2 decreases due to the disturbance.\nBecause VLV and M remain constant, the power P1 of DAB1\nwill increase and the powerP2 of DAB2 will decrease from (5).\nBecause the LVDC voltages of DAB1 and DAB2 are the same,\nthe parallel current I1f 2 increases and I2f 2 decreases, and then\nI1f 1 increases and I2f 1 decreases due to the ﬁxed turns ratio\nof the transformer. From (16), the capacitor current I1C 1 of\nSC1 will decrease and the capacitor current I2C 1 of SC2 will\nincrease; because the capacitor current is zero in the steady state,\nI1C 1 become negative and I2C 1 become positive, that is, C11 is\ndischarged and C21 is charged. Then, the discrete voltage V11\nof SC1 will decrease and the discrete voltage V21 of SC2 will\nincrease, and the SCDCT will recover balance automatically.\nFig. 5(a) shows the self-balancing simulation waveforms of\nSCDCT without balancing control. Beforet0, the SCDCT oper-\nates well. At t0, the disturbance occurs, the discrete voltageV11\nof SC1 increases and the discrete voltageV21 of SC2 decreases.\nHowever, due to the self-balancing ability of SCDCT, both the\nmax{λSCDCT } =\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎪⎩\n1, cos(Mπ) ≥ r\nrmax\nsin(Mπ)√\n[(r/rmax ) − cos(Mπ)]2 +s i n2(Mπ)\n, cos(Mπ) < r\nrmax\n(14)\nZHAO et al.: HIGH-FREQUENCY-LINK DC TRANSFORMER BASED ON SCDCT FOR MVDC POWER DISTRIBUTION APPLICATION 4771\nFig. 5. Simulation waveforms of SCDCT without balancing control. (a) Self-\nbalancing with a disturbance. (b) Unbalancing with inconsistent capacitor pa-\nrameters.\ndiscrete voltages and parallel currents recover balancing after a\nperiod of adjustment.\nHowever, when the circuit parameters of submodules are not\nconsistent, although the SCDCT can operates stably, the series\nvoltages and parallel currents cannot keep balancing in some\nsituations. Fig. 5(b) shows the simulation waveforms of SCDCT\nwhen the capacitors are not consistent. Before t0, the SCDCT\noperates well in no-load condition. Att0, the battery is switched\ninto the LVDC side to transfer power to the HVDC side. As the\ncapacitors are not consistent, the SCDCT became stable, but the\ndiscrete voltages and parallel currents become unbalancing.\nB. Stability of Balancing Control\nAccording to the aforementioned analysis, although the\nSCDCT has some self-balancing ability, the balancing con-\ntrol should to be added to ensure the voltage balance of dis-\ncrete capacitors and the current balance of each DAB in all the\nsituations.\nIn the steady state, the average current across the discrete\ncapacitor during one period is zero, from (16), we have\nIiC 1 =0 ,I if 1 = Ii1 =( 1− D)IHV . (17)\nIgnoring the power loss, the input and output powers of DABi\nare the same and then\nPi = Vi1Iif 1 = Vi2Iif 2. (18)\nFig. 6. Stability analysis of SCDCT with balancing control. (a) Forward power\nﬂow. (b) Reverse power ﬂow.\nBecause the currents of the SCDCT in the series side are the\nsame and the voltages in the parallel side are the same, we have\nP1 = P2 = ··· = PN\n⇔ V11 = V21 = ··· = VN 1\nOR I1f 2 = I2f 2 = ··· = VNf 2. (19)\nFrom (19), either the voltage balance in the series side or\nthe current balance in the parallel side can lead to the power\nbalance of the SCDCT. However, two methods have different\ncontrol stabilities.\nWhen the control for the series voltage balance is employed,\nfrom (5), the power of all the DABs are the same due to the\nvoltage equality in the parallel side, so the currents in the parallel\nside are also equal.\nFrom (16) and (18), the dynamic process in the series side\ncan be shown in Fig. 6 when the control for the parallel current\nbalance is employed. In the initial state, the DABi operates stably\nat point A; thus, Vi1 = Vcaver , Iif 1 = Ii1, and Iic1 =0 ; because\nthe parallel currents are controlled to equal, so the powers of all\nthe modules are also equal.\nWhen the power is in the forward ﬂow, the dynamic process\nis shown in Fig. 6(a). Assume that the disturbance causes the\ndecrease in the capacitor voltage Vi1. Then Iif 1 increases and\nthe operation point changes from A to B. Because the series\ncurrent Ii1 is constant, the capacitor current Iic1 changes from\nzero to below zero, in which case the capacitor discharges and\nthe voltage further decreases. Therefore, a positive feedback is\nproduced and the capacitor voltage continues to decrease until it\nbecomes zero, and then the parallel current balance is destroyed.\nWhen the power is in the reverse ﬂow, the dynamic process\nis shown in Fig. 6(b). Assume that the disturbance causes the\ndecrease in the capacitor voltageVi1. ThenIif 1 increases and the\noperation point change from A to B. Because the series current\n4772 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 31, NO. 7, JULY 2016\nFig. 7. Control design for SCDCT with series voltage control.\nIi1 is constant, the capacitor currentIic1 is changes from zero to\nabove zero, in which case the capacitor charges and the voltage\nincreases. Therefore, a negative feedback is produced, and the\ncapacitor voltage recovers to the balance state.\nAccording to the aforementioned analysis, the current balance\nin the parallel side can be always achieved when the control for\nthe voltage balance in the series side is employed; the voltage\nbalance in the series side can be achieved in the reverse power\nﬂow when the control for the current balance in the parallel\nside is employed; however, the system will be unstable in the\nforward power ﬂow.\nC. Control Design of SCDCT\nAccording to the aforementioned analysis, because SCDCT\nis a bidirectional system, to ensure the stable operation both\nin the forward and the reverse power ﬂows, the control for the\nvoltage balance in the series side is employed in the paper.\nFig. 7 shows a control strategy for SCDCT. In Fig. 7, the dc\ndiscrete voltages are controlled by SSCI and the LVDC voltage\nis controlled by HFLI. In SSCI, the HVDC voltage controller\ntakes the difference value between the sampled average value\nVcaver and the set reference value VCr to the PI controller, and\nthe output of the PI controller is used as a uniﬁed reference value\nIi1r0 of the series current controller. The balancing controller\nsamples the dc discrete voltage Vi1 and then compares Vcaver\nand Vi1 to calculate the correcting value ΔIi1 of the uniﬁed\nreference current Ii1r0. The actual reference current Ii1r is the\nsynthesis of Ii1r0 and ΔIi1. Then the series current controller\ncalculates the duty ratio Di of each SC according to Ii1r and\nthe sampled series current Ii1.\nIn HFLI, the LVDC voltage controller takes the difference\nvalue between the sampled voltageVLV and set reference value\nVLV r to the PI controller, and the output of the PI controller is\nused as the reference current ILV r of the parallel current con-\ntroller. The parallel current controller samples all the currents\nin the parallel side and calculates their average value ILV aver .\nThen the PS ratio Mi is achieved by the adjustment of the PI\ncontroller.\nFig. 8. Discrete capacitor current varied with duty ratio in different power\nﬂows.\nIn Fig. 7, the HVDC voltage controller, the LVDC voltage\ncontroller, and the parallel current controller are the common\ncontrollers, and the balancing controller and the series current\ncontroller are the separate controllers for each SC submodule;\nso the duty ratios may be different for different SCs but the PS\nratios for all the DABs are the same.\nIn Fig. 7, the average values of the dc discrete voltages and\nparallel currents can be calculated, respectively, as\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎩\nVcaver = V11 + V21 + ··· + VN 1\nN\nILVver = I12 + I22 + ··· + IN 2\nN\n. (20)\nIn balancing controller, there is only the proportion adjust-\nment parameter Kdelt for the correcting value ΔIi1. To ensure\ncorrection adjustment law, the capacitor current needs to be ad-\njusted with a negative value to discharge the capacitor when the\ncapacitor voltage Vi1 is greater than the average valueVcaver ;i n\nturn, the capacitor current needs to be adjusted with a positive\nvalue to charge the capacitor when the capacitor voltage Vi1 is\nless than the average value Vcaver .\nFrom (16) and (17), Fig. 8 shows the curves of the capacitor\ncurrent varied with the duty ratio in different power ﬂows. In the\nsteady state, the SCDCT operates at point O, and the average\ncurrent of the capacitor is zero. In the forward power ﬂow,\nwhen the duty ratio is increased and decreased, the capacitor\ncurrent will be negative and positive, respectively. However,\nin the reverse power ﬂow, the capacitor current will change to\npositive and negative values when the duty ratio is increased\nand decreased, respectively. This means the adjustment law is\ndifferent in different power ﬂows. So the power ﬂow direction\nneeds to be sampled in real time to ensure that the correcting\nvalue ΔIi1 has different polarities in different power ﬂows,\nensuring the effective operation of the balancing controller.\nV. S TARTUP AND FAULT CHARACTERIZATION OF SCDCT\nFOR MVDC DISTRIBUTION\nA. Soft Startup Characterization\nBecause the initial voltage of all the capacitors is zero, a\nstartup resistance R is added to avoid overcurrent in switches.\nWhen the SCDCT is accessed to the MVDC distribution grid,\nthe discrete capacitor will be charged by way of dc inductor L,\nZHAO et al.: HIGH-FREQUENCY-LINK DC TRANSFORMER BASED ON SCDCT FOR MVDC POWER DISTRIBUTION APPLICATION 4773\nFig. 9.

The\ndynamic equation is given by\nLC d2vc1\nd2t + RC dvc1\ndt + vc1 = VHV (21)\nwhere C is the equivalent of all the discrete capacitors in Fig. 8\nand vc1 is the voltage of the equivalent capacitor.\nAssuming all the discrete capacitors are the same and the\ncapacitance isCHV , thenC = CHV /N. From (21), the capacitor\nvoltage vc1 and the capacitor current ic1 can be derived as\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎪⎩\nvc1 = VHV\n[\n1+ 1\np2 − p1\n(p1ep2 t − p2ep1 t)\n]\nic1 = VHV\nL(p2 − p1)(ep2 t − ep1 t)\n(22)\nwhere\n⎧\n⎨\n⎩\np1 = −γ +\n√\nγ2 − ω2\np2 = −γ −\n√\nγ2 − ω2\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎩\nγ = R\n2L\nω = 1√\nLC\n.

(24)\nThe startup resistance R should be designed to ensure the\ncharging current below the current threshold value Imax of the\nswitches.\nThe capacitors in the LVDC side are charged by the DABs,\nall the switches of the H-bridges in the LV side are turned off,\nand the H-bridges in the HV side generate square waves with\nsmall duty ratios to avoid overcurrent, as shown in Fig. 9.

First, the bypass switch is opened and\nthe discrete capacitor is charged softly. When the discrete ca-\npacitor voltage reaches the reference value, the bypass switch\nis closed, all the driving pulses Qi1 − Qi2 are opened, and the\nclosed-loop controllers of the SSCI are enabled. After the SSCI\noperates stably, all the driving pulsesSi1 − Si4 are opened with\nsmall duty ratio, all the driving pulsesSi5 ∼ Si8 are closed and\nthe LV H-bridges operate in the uncontrolled rectiﬁer to charge\nthe LVDC bus; when the LVDC capacitor voltage reaches the\nreference value, all the driving pulsesSi5 − Si8 are opened and\nthe closed-loop controllers of HFLI are enabled.\n4774 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 31, NO. 7, JULY 2016\nFig. 11.

Fault Characterization of SCDCT\nAll the function failures caused by the insulation, mechani-\ncal, and control faults can lead to the failure of the DCT. When\naccessing the MVDC distribution grid, the number of the sub-\nmodules will be high, which increases the failure rate of the\nDCT. In order to improve the system reliability, the DCT should\nstill run normally when one or a few submodules fail.\nFor TDCT, due to the existence of a concentrated capacitor, it\nis unable to operate with a redundant unit when the submodule\nfails; otherwise, the dc capacitor of the faulted submodule will\nbe short-circuited. Therefore, the TDCT must stop running when\nthe submodule fails, which reduces the system reliability.\nCompared to TDCT, due to the employment of the SSCI, the\nfaulted submodule of the SCDCT can be switched out quickly\nand the system can still run normally. Fig. 10(b) shows the fault\nlogic of the SCDCT with submodule failure. Here, let us take\nDABi as an example. In the normal operation, the switchesQi1\nand Qi2 of SCi are switched in turn according to the voltage\nconversion model in Section III. When the failure occurs in\nDABi, Qi1 is turned off and Qi2 keeps continuous conduction\nand then the DABi is switched out and the dc capacitorCi1 does\nnot discharge. After that, the number of the normal submodules\nis changed from N to N-1, but due to the voltage control func-\ntion of SSCI, the dc discrete voltage for all the normal modules\ncan still be controlled to VHV /N to ensure the voltage match\nbetween the two sides of the HFL transformer. Then the cir-\nculating current can also be decreased; when the faulted DABi\nrecovers normal, it also can be switched into operation online\nand the operation of SCDCT will not be affected.\nBecause the SSCI is a boost circuit, the number of modules\nthat can fail is limited. In addition, to ensure that the system can\noperate normally both in sag and in swell conditions, the sum of\nthe discrete voltages will be designed to be higher than the max-\nimum allowable ﬂuctuation voltage of the MVDC grid. Thus,\nexcept for all the fault modules, the number of the operating\nmodules should be constrained asN>V HV /Vcaver . In fact, for\na power electronics system, the number of redundant modules is\nrelated to reliability, cost, and efﬁciency. The greater the num-\nber, the higher the reliability, but the cost and efﬁciency will be\ndiscounted. Usually, 10%–20% is appropriate in a ﬂexible dc\ntransmission and distribution system.\nAccording to the aforementioned analysis, compared to\nTDCT, SCDCT can keep running normally when the submodule\nbreaks down, which improves the reliability.\nVI. E XPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\nIn order to verify the theoretical analysis mentioned ear-\nlier, a 1-kW SCDCT prototype with three submodules is built,\nwhere the MVDC and the LVDC rated voltages, respectively,\nare VHV = 400 V and VLV = 200 V , the dc inductor L =5\nmH, the dc capacitors Ci1 = Ci2 = 3300 μF, the HFL inductor\nLT = 100 μH, the transformer ratio n =1:1 , and the switch-\ning frequency fs =2 0 kHz.\nFig. 11 shows the voltage and current waveforms of SCDCT\nin the steady state. It can be seen that the MVDC and the LVDC\nbuses stay at 400 and 200 V steadily, respectively; both the\ncurrent voltage conversions of SCDCT operate ﬁne. All the\nvoltages of discrete capacitors are equal, which reﬂects a well\nvoltage balance effect; all the HFL currents of each DAB are\nalso equal, which reﬂects a well power balance effect.\nFig. 12 shows the voltage and current waveforms of SCDCT\nduring the startup process. Att0, the SCDCT is connected to the\nMVDC grid. As the bypass switch is opened, the discrete capac-\nitor is charged, and the MVDC start current is suppressed below\n5 A due to the employment of the soft startup resistance. Dur-\ning t0 − t1, the bypass switch is closed. At t1, driving pulses\nQi1 − Qi2 are opened and the closed-loop controllers of the\nSSCI are enabled to control the voltages of the discrete capac-\nitors at 200 V . At t2, the driving pulses Si1 − Si4 are opened\nwith small duty ratios and the LV H-bridges operate in an un-\ncontrolled rectiﬁer to charge the LVDC bus; moreover, the HFL\nstart current is suppressed below 10 A due to the employment of\n⎧\n⎪⎨\n⎪⎩\nvc2 = vc2(δThs )c o s [ω′(t − δThs )] + ic2(δThs )\nω sin[ω′(t − δThs )]\nic2 = −vc2(δThs )ω′sin[ω′(t − δThs )] +ic2(δThs )c o s [ω′(t − δThs )]\n(27)\nZHAO et al.: HIGH-FREQUENCY-LINK DC TRANSFORMER BASED ON SCDCT FOR MVDC POWER DISTRIBUTION APPLICATION 4775\nFig. 12.

Att3, the driving pulsesSi5 − Si8 are opened\nand the closed-loop controllers of HFLI are enabled to control\nthe LVDC voltage at 200 V . From experiments, the SCDCT\noperates ﬁne during the startup process.\nFig. 13 shows the voltage and current waveforms of SCDCT\nwhen a submodule is switched out and in. Before t4, SCDCT\noperates ﬁne during the steady state. At t4, a failure occurs in\nDAB3, and SCDCT controls DAB3 to be switched out. It can\nbe seen that the discrete voltageV31 keeps constant and that the\nnumber of operating submodules is changed to two; however,\nthe SCDCT also can operate ﬁne, the transmission power of\nDAB3 decreases to 0, the transmission power of DAB1 and\nDAB2 increases, both the discrete voltages and HFI currents\nof DAB1 and DAB3 still keep balance, and the transformer\nvoltages can still keep match. Att5, the failure is eliminated and\nthe DAB3 is switched into operation. It can be seen the SCDCT\n4776 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 31, NO. 7, JULY 2016\nalso can operate ﬁne, the transmission power of DAB3 increases,\nthe transmission power of DAB1 and DAB2 decreases, all the\ndiscrete voltages and HFI currents recover balance, and the\ntransformer voltages can still keep match. From experiments,\nthe SCDCT operates ﬁne when the submodule failure occurs\nand the reliability can be improved.\nFig. 14 shows the current stress and efﬁciency comparisons of\nSCDCT and TDCT in different conditions. The TDCT employs\nthe multiple DCT topology based on DAB as shown in [20], and\nthe experimental results are also measured in the same SCDCT\nprototype by removing SSCI.\nIt can be seen that the current stress of SCDCT remains\nconstant in different conditions and that the current stress of\nTDCT increases quickly when the voltage deviate away from\nthe matching value. Due to the addition of SSCI, the efﬁciency\nof SCDCT in matching states is a little lower than that of TDCT,\nbut the efﬁciency of TDCT decreases quickly when the voltage\ndeviates away from the matching value, and it is lower than that\nof SCDCT over a wide range. From experiments, the SCDCT\ncan adjust the voltage of the dc discrete terminals to ensure the\nvoltage match between the two sides of the HFL transformer,\nand then the current stress and efﬁciency performances can be\nimproved.\nVII. C ONCLUSION\nThe DCT will be the key device for dc power distribution\nto achieve ﬂexible control and fast management of voltage and\npower between the MVDC distribution grid and the LVDC mi-\ncrogrid. The SCDCT scheme is proposed in this paper, and\nthe voltage and power characterization, control strategy, startup\nand fault solution, and experiments of SCDCT for MVDC dis-\ntribution application are present and analyzed comprehensively.\nCompared to the TDCT scheme, the proposed SCDCT can dis-\nconnect from the MVDC distribution grid effectively as a dc\nbreaker and adjust the voltage of the dc discrete terminals to\nensure the voltage match between the two sides of the HFL\ntransformer. Then the circulating current is decreased and the\ncurrent impact and efﬁciency performances is improved. In ad-\ndition, SCDCT can operate well when some submodules fail,\nand then the reliability can be improved. The experimental re-\nsults verify the excellent performances of the proposed SCDCT,\nwhich can satisfy the requirements of practical applications in\ndc distribution.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D. J.
