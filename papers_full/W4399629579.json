  "abstract": "This paper explores opportunities to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to make network configuration human-friendly, simplifying the configuration of network devices &amp; development of routing algorithms and minimizing errors. We design a set of benchmarks (NetConfEval) to examine the effectiveness of different models in facilitating and automating network configuration. More specifically, we focus on the scenarios where LLMs translate high-level policies, requirements, and descriptions (i.e., specified in natural language) into low-level network configurations &amp; Python code. NetConfEval considers four tasks that could potentially facilitate network configuration, such as (i) generating high-level requirements into a formal specification format, (ii) generating API/function calls from high-level requirements, (iii) developing routing algorithms based on high-level descriptions, and (iv) generating low-level configuration for existing and new protocols based on input documentation. Learning from the results of our study, we propose a set of principles to design LLM-based systems to configure networks. Finally, we present two GPT-4-based prototypes to (i) automatically configure P4-enabled devices from a set of high-level requirements and (ii) integrate LLMs into existing network synthesizers.",
