  "abstract": "We are in a booming era of artificial intelligence, particularly with the increased availability of technologies that can help generate content, such as ChatGPT. Healthcare institutions are discussing or have started utilizing these innovative technologies within their workflow. Major electronic health record vendors have begun to leverage large language models to process and analyze vast amounts of clinical natural language text, performing a wide range of tasks in healthcare settings to help alleviate clinicians' burden. Although such technologies can be helpful in applications such as patient education, drafting responses to patient questions and emails, medical record summarization, and medical research facilitation, there are concerns about the tools' readiness for use within the healthcare domain and acceptance by the current workforce. The goal of this article is to provide nurses with an understanding of the currently available foundation models and artificial intelligence tools, enabling them to evaluate the need for such tools and assess how they can impact current clinical practice. This will help nurses efficiently assess, implement, and evaluate these tools to ensure these technologies are ethically and effectively integrated into healthcare systems, while also rigorously monitoring their performance and impact on patient care.",
