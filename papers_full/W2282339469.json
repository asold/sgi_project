The beneﬁts can also\nbe seen in medical education and delivering healthcare\nin remote places. We report the use of Google Glass\ntechnology as a teaching tool in broadcasting a\nprocedure onto a mobile phone as a viewer, replacing\nexpensive and often cumbersome existing equipment.\nBACKGROUND\nBroadcasting surgical procedures is often only pos-\nsible in specially designed theatre environments,\nusing expensive and cumbersome equipment.\nHaving obtained Google Glass technology , we\nwanted to explore the potential for making medical\nprocedures easily accessible and wondered about\nhow easy it might be to screencast the view from\nthe in-built camera to a smartphone display during\na procedure. The ease and clarity with which this\nwas performed was something we felt may have\nmany uses for medical education.\nCASE PRESENTATION\nA 20-year-old woman with no medical or family\nhistory came to cardiology services with palpita-\ntions that were associated with presyncope. She had\na normal resting ECG, normal echocardiogram and\nan initial 24 h ambulatory ECG monitor showed\nsinus rhythm. She did not record any symptoms\nwhen given a cardiac memo device. After a period\nof being symptom free, she had further symptom-\natic palpitations but these settled by the time\nmedical contact was sought.\nAn implantable loop recorder (ILR) was consid-\nered but due to her slim build, she was not keen on\nthe previous generation Reveal DX model\n(Medtronic). At the time, a newer, smaller and\ninjectable ILR (LINQ, Medtronic) was being made\ncommercially and was widely available; it was felt\nshe would be a good candidate for this, to which\nshe consented.\nThe LINQ device had not previously been\nimplanted at our institution. The operator (AB) had\nalso recently obtained the new Google Glass\n(Google Inc) (ﬁgure 1A), a wearable set of glasses\nwith in-built camera and heads-up display , which\nhas Internet connectivity . It also has in-built broad-\ncast features via Bluetooth connectivity . As other\noperators (PRG) showed interest in watching the\nﬁrst LINQ implant, we wondered whether broad-\ncasting the procedure was possible.\nAfter appropriate patient consent, we paired\nGoogle Glass with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3\n(Samsung) via Bluetooth. AB wore the Google\nGlass while performing the procedure in the\ntheatre environment. PRG sat in the control room\narea remotely viewing on the Samsung phone what\nthe Google Glass wearer was seeing (ﬁgure 1B–D).\nThe procedure was completed successfully and\nwithout complications, and the patient was dis-\ncharged shortly afterwards.\nFigure 1 (A) Google Glass; (B) Operator (AB) wearing Google Glass; (C) Samsung Galaxy Note 3 showing screencast\nof procedure from Google Glass; (D) PRG viewing screencast remotely on Samsung phone (arrowed) in control room.\nKnight HM, et al.

Downloaded from \nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\nAs yet, the patient has had no further symptomatic palpitations.\nIn the context of medical education, the Google Glass broad-\ncasting of a live procedure over a short distance via Bluetooth\nappeared to be successful. For the technology to be deemed\nuseful, a number of factors were considered. The ease of use of\nthe technology for the person doing the procedure and the\nperson viewing it were important factors. AB’s Google Glass\ncame with prescription lenses so it was unobtrusive and he\nreported no dif ﬁculties in completing the procedure. The\npairing process via Bluetooth was simple and PRG reported no\ndifﬁculties getting set up.\nThe important consideration was whether watching the pro-\ncedure using this setup was useful from a training perspective.\nPRG reported that watching the procedure on the high-\ndeﬁnition screen of the Samsung Note phone was a good\nexperience. Owing to broadcasting over a short distance using\nBluetooth, there was no lag reported in the audio/video signal.\nAdditionally , the Google Glass’s unique viewpoint from the\noperator’s eyeline was useful to someone who might be training\nto perform a procedure themselves.\nDISCUSSION\nThe use of technology to aid medical education is well\ndescribed. W e report another such case in which wearable tech-\nnology could be used to aid the teaching of procedures without\na large amount of expensive equipment (eg, video headsets,\ntransmission wiring and screens). A recent study compared\nGoogle Glass and GoPro cameras in theﬁeld of plastic surgery .\n1\nThe authors concluded that Google Glass would be a good way\nfor trainees to easily acquire intraoperative footage for self-\nreview whereas the more cumbersome GoPro would be used to\namass a video library of common operations. A recent press\nrelease from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) has sug-\ngested that Google Glass may be integrated into its medical\nteaching courses for exactly such reasons.\n2\nAs well as being used by trainers to broadcast to trainees,\nsome case reports have suggested that Google Glass may be\nused by trainers to instruct trainees wearing Google Glass—\nso-called ‘telementoring’. Studies have reported success in\northopaedic shoulder surgery\n3 and in training people to acquire\nsimple views during cardiac ultrasonography .4 There are some\nlimitations— a study reported limitations regarding the camera\nresolution of Google Glass in some scenarios of ECG interpret-\nation.\n5 A study in a simulated disaster environment compared\nparamedics conducting traditional triage versus triage using\nGoogle Glass broadcasting to an off-site physician.6 There was\nno difference in accuracy of triage but Google Glass mediated\ntriage took substantially longer. This highlights the fact that\nrigorous evaluation of telemedicine is required when consider-\ning ‘replacement’of established procedures.\nThere are ethical considerations. A study has shown that live\nbroadcasting does not increase operative risk in cardiac surgery .\n7\nHowever, these ﬁndings are not necessarily translatable across\nall surgical disciplines, surgeons and type of recording equip-\nment. Patient consent is important (which we obtained) but we\ndecided not to store any videodata. There may be issues about\nsafety of such data regarding storage. The General Medical\nCouncil (GMC, UK) makes it clear that explicit consent must be\nobtained\n8 and the Data Protection Act, 1998, also makes it clear\nthat data must be stored appropriately and only for the neces-\nsary length of time. As technology becomes more pervasive,\nphysicians, patients and the public need to come to decisions\nregarding appropriate uses as well as setting boundaries. This is\nnecessarily a dynamic process as the speed of technological\ndevelopment accelerates.\nLearning points\n▸ Appli cations of wearable technology within medicine are\nlikely to expand as technology advances.\n▸ The use of Google Glass for broadcasting of procedures for\nothers to view appears easy and effective.\n▸ Up-to-date guidance for doctors regarding the use of\ntechnology in a safe and ethical manner is needed.\nContributors HMK and PRG wrote the article with AB providing critical review.\nPRG and AB carried out the procedure and looked after the patient.\nCompeting interests None declared.\nPatient consent Obtained.\nProvenance and peer reviewNot commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\nREFERENCES\n1 Paro JAM, Nazareli R, Gurjala A, et al.
