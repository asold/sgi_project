INTRODUCTION\nA solid-state transformer (SST) (also called power electronic\ntransformer, electronic power transformer, or smart trans-\nformer) is a promising power electronic device with voltage\ntransformation, electrical isolation, and power factor correc-\ntion capabilities. SST can be used for locomotive traction,\nsmart grid, and energy internet [1]–[6].\nModular structures are widely adopted for medium-voltage\n(MV) SSTs [7]–[10] to achieve high-voltage and high-\npower capacities. This structure is easy to apply in manu-\nfacture and engineering. Numerous types of modular SSTs\nhave been developed. A modular-multilevel-converter based\nSST (MMC-SST) is presented by [7]. At least four ports\n(MV AC, MVDC, LVDC, and LV AC) can be provided. As the\nMMC-SST has an MVDC port, it is suitable for applications\nwith a centralized photovoltaic or centralized wind power\naccess to the grid. Another MMC-SST is presented in [8],\nwhich is more modularized whereas increases the device\ncount of power switches and high-frequency (compared\nwith the line frequency) transformers (HFTs). For MV AC,\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Madhav Manjrekar.\nto LVDC and LV AC applications, the modular-multilevel-\nconverter based SST proposed by [9] is named M 2LC-SST,\nwhich achieves high-frequency isolation with only one HFT\nso that does not have parameter difference problems of the HF\nlink. A cascaded full-bridge (or H-bridge) based SST (CFB-\nSST) proposed by [10] is used in MV AC, to LVDC and LV AC\napplications. CFB-SST obtains a higher efﬁciency due to the\nsoft switching capability of HF link power switches and lower\npower switch current than M 2LC-SST. CFB-SST reduces the\ndevice count of power switches and HFTs compared with\nM2LC-SST. However, the device count of HFTs of CFB-SST\nis still much higher than that of M 2LC-SST.\nCost and reliability are two of the main issues that inhibit\nSST entry in the market [1]. The reliability of SST can be\nenhanced by using a modular structure with sub-module (SM)\nredundancy. The cost of SST is closely affected by the device\ncount of power switches, HFTs, and their power capaci-\nties. However, the aforementioned topologies are expensive\nbecause they have a large device count of either power\nswitches or HFTs. Reduction of the device count of power\nswitches and HFTs has several advantages besides cost sav-\nings: Fewer power switches consequently reduces the optical\nﬁbres and control logics, which simpliﬁes the secondary\n22118\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\nsystem and mechanical structure, besides, it also helps with\nthe reduction of converter volume, because one housing\nof power switches may available for different rated cur-\nrent. A low device count AC/DC converter is presented\nin [11] which uses HF block-wave modulation with LF-varied\nphase shifting to achieve single-stage conversion. The power-\ncapacity requirement of HFT is increased in this topology\nsince its HFT current contains rich harmonics, which results\nin higher costs for MV applications, wherein HFTs are expen-\nsive. Fewer HFTs consequently reduces the overall volume\nsince the isolation interval weights more in the volume of\nHFTs than the line-frequency one [12]. Using a centralized\nHFT can reduce the device count of HFTs thereby reducing\nthe isolation spaces and materials. It also helps eliminate\nthe parameter-difference problem of the distributed HFT.\nAnother beneﬁt of the centralized HFT is the cost reduction\n(an analysis is presented in section III, B). Compared with the\ncentralized HFT, the distributed HFT is wildly used in state-\nof-the-art SST topologies. It reduces the power capacity, volt-\nage stress, and volume of each HFT. Therefore, distributed\nHFT is easier for manufacture than a centralized one. Using\na set of HFTs rather than one can increase the robustness of\nSST. Moreover, a distributed HFT can achieve lower no/low-\npower-state loss. So, from the comparison above, the cen-\ntralized HFT is preferable in aspects of cost saving, vol-\nume reduction, and control simpliﬁcation. At present, there\nare some challenges of the design and manufacture of high\npower-capacity HFTs, but it is promising that these difﬁcul-\nties can be overcame with the development of HFTs.\nIn this study, a new SST topology family is presented for\nsingle- or multi-phase MV AC, to LVDC and LV AC applica-\ntions to reduce the device count of power switches and HFTs,\nthereby reducing costs while obtaining beneﬁts, such as sim-\nple engineering and compact structures. However, the efﬁ-\nciency of the proposed topology is relatively lower than that\nof CFB-SST. Given that efﬁciency is a main factor that should\nbe considered for SST, the proposed topology is especially\nsuitable for applications where a power transformer’s initial\ncosts are higher than its life cycle costs of power loss, that is,\napplications where the life cycle utilization rate of a power\ntransformer is relatively low (e.g., lower than 32.3% in Fos-\nhan, China, and lower than 30.91% in Shantou, China [13]).\nFurthermore, the life of power electronic devices is 10 years\nwhereas that of an LF power transformer is 30 years [14].\nThus, the initial price accounts for a large proportion in SST\nthan that in an LF transformer. The proposed topology is\nalso suitable for applications wherein the weight and volume\nof the SST are the most important factors, e.g., in traction\napplications.\nThe proposed topology is based on the concept of hybrid-\nfrequency modulation, in which the modulation wave has at\nleast two different frequency components. Hybrid-frequency\nmodulation is widely used in power electronic devices such\nas modular matrix converter (M3C) [15] for generating\ndifferent-frequency inputs and outputs, active power ﬁl-\nter (APF) [16] for achieving various frequency harmonic\nFIGURE 1. Equivalent circuit.\ncompensations, and MMC [17] for obtaining DC, line-\nfrequency and double line-frequency AC in bridge arms.\nSince the proposed topology is based on a cascaded full-\nbridge, it is named hybrid-frequency CFB SST (HCFB-SST).\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 presents the concept and circuits of HCFB-SST.\nSection 3 describes the feature comparisons and feature high-\nlights. Section 4 establishes a switching-frequency-reduced\nhybrid-frequency modulation method and a SM capacitor\nvoltage-balancing strategy. Section 5 carries out a semicon-\nductor power loss analysis. Section 6 discusses the simulation\nstudies. Section 7 summaries this paper.\nII. CONCEPT AND CIRCUITS OF HCFB-SST\nIn this section, the concept of hybrid-frequency modula-\ntion is introduced, the circuit conﬁguration of HCFB-SST is\npresented, and the feature comparisons of HCFB-SST with\ntwo different modular SSTs are conducted, followed by the\nfeature highlights of HCFB-SST.\nA. CONCEPT OF PROPOSED TOPOLOGY\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the converter outputs two different-\nfrequency voltages. The HF voltage can be a sine (Fig. 1a) or\nblock (Fig. 1b) wave. The LF voltage is often a line-frequency\nsine wave. Low-path ﬁlter (LPF) and band-path ﬁlter (BPF)\nare used to divide the different frequency currents into differ-\nent paths. Loads are fed by different-frequency powers from\ncorresponding LF path or HF path (HF link). The converter\ncan separately handle different-frequency powers because\nthey have no coupling with each other for orthogonality. Pre-\nvious work [18] makes signiﬁcant contributions and shows\nthe low device count of single-stage-isolated DC/AC con-\nverter based on the similar concepts as shown in Fig. 1.\nThis converter aims at solar photovoltaic and fuel-cell appli-\ncations. For MV applications, modular structure is applied\ntherefore makes differences in topologies and controls. Fur-\nthermore, the HFT RMS current of the DC/AC converter\nin [18] is 365% of that of a two-stage DAB-based DC/AC\nconverter [18] thereby greatly increases costs, since in MV\napplications, the costs of HFT is a large part of SST’s overall\ncosts. Thus, a cost-saving, simple-engineering, and compact-\nstructure SST topology and control based on the concepts in\nFig. 1 are presented in the followings.\nB. CIRCUITS OF PROPOSED TOPOLOGY\nThe proposed topology is based on the principle of hybrid-\nfrequency modulation. Fig. 2a shows a simple single-phase\nVOLUME 7, 2019 22119\nX. Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\nFIGURE 2. Circuit of single-phase HCFB-SST.\nstructure of the proposed topology. The CFB functions as a\nmulti-frequency voltage source. Filter inductor Lf serves as\nan LPF. Resonant capacitor Cr and inductor Lr operate as a\nBPF, wherein Lr can be integrated into HFT Tr. A secondary-\nside FB rectiﬁes the HF current into the LVDC bus. A DC/AC\non the LVDC bus, not shown in Fig. 2a, provides a LV AC\nport. Fig. 2b presents the extension circuit through cell cas-\ncading. Two cascaded cells consist of one block, as shown\nin the dashed line box in Fig. 2b. The two cells in one\nblock output the same-phase line-frequency voltage and the\nopposite-phase HF voltage to eliminate the voltage stress and\nhigh dv/dt on the grid line caused by the HF voltage outputs.\nTwo basic circuits are used for three-phase applications,\nas shown in Fig. 3. The three single-phase bridge arms in\nFig. 2a are star-connected, as shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3a, three\nseparated HF paths in the primary side are used in the type\n1 circuit. The DC ports of the three secondary-side FBSMs\nare parallel connected to provide a LVDC bus. The DC/AC in\nthe LVDC bus, not shown in Fig. 3a, converts LVDC to LV AC.\nIn Fig. 3b, three star-connected phase resonant inductors\nLri(i =a,b,c) and capacitors Cri are used in the type 2 circuit.\nCri prevents the line-frequency current from injecting into\nthe HF path and Lri limits the HF circling current. Lri and\nCri provide a common point and from which, a neutral-line\nHF path is established through neutral resonant capacitor Crn,\ninductor Lrn, and an HFT Trn to transport the power. Only one\nHFT and secondary-side FBSM are used in the type 2 circuit.\nNo line-frequency current injects into the HFT under balance\nFIGURE 3. Basic circuit of three-phase HCFB-SST.\nloads in the type 2 circuit whereas no HF cycling current\nexists in the type 1 circuit. The circling paths in the type 2\ncircuit provide the possibility of handling the three-phase\nunbalance and low line frequency by injecting HF cycling\ncurrents to balance the capacitor voltages of three-phase SMs\nas well as reduce the capacitor voltage ripples.\nThe extension topology of three-phase HCFB-SST is\nshown in Fig. 4. Cells in Fig. 4 come from the circuit in the\ndashed-line box in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b. The cell type can be\ndifferent, e.g., adopting type 1 cell in block 1 and type 2\ncell in block 2, where the main duty of block 1 is power\ntransporting while that’s of block 2 is to deal with the three-\nphase unbalance. Same as the single-phase extension circuit\nin Fig. 2b, the three-phase extension circuit can eliminate the\nvoltage stress and high dv/dt on the grid line caused by the\nHF voltage outputs.\nThe circuit conﬁgurations for other multi-phase applica-\ntions are essentially extensions of the three-phase circuits and\nwill not be discussed in this study.\nOn the basis of analysis above, the HCFB-SST copes\nwith various voltage-level, power-level, line-frequency, and\nnumber of phase applications by adopting different circuits.\nIII. FEATURE COMPARISONS AND HIGHLIGHTS\nIn this section, feature comparisons between HCFB-SST, M 2\nLC-SST, and CFB-SST are conducted and followed by the\nfeature highlights of HCFB-SST. The following analysis is\nbased on the HF block voltage as shown in Fig. 1b.\n22120 VOLUME 7, 2019\nX. Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\nFIGURE 4. Extension circuit of three-phase HCFB-SST.\nA. FEATURE COMPARISONS\nThe HCFB-SST, M 2LC-SST and CFB-SST for single-phase\nand three-phase applications are compared in aspects of the\ndevice count of HFTs and power switches, and the current of\npower switches, but not including the secondary-side invertor.\n1) For single-phase applications Single-phase applica-\ntions can be single-phase power grid applications, trac-\ntion applications and so on. Supposing there is only\none secondary-side DC port in these three topologies,\nassuming the ratio of the device count of SMs out-\nputting HF block voltage and LF sine voltage is ∂\n(∂ ∈R+) in HCFB-SST and M 2LC-SST. The circuit\nin Fig. 2a is taken as an example in the followings. For\nthe extension circuit, differences are only the device\ncount of HFTs and secondary-side power switches, thus\nresults bellow can be easily extended to it.\n2) Comparison of device count of HFTs The HCFB-SST\nand M 2LC-SST both require one HFT whereas the\nCFB-SST requires NSM.LF-time more. The ratio of the\ndevice count of HFTs of HCFB-SST (or M 2LC-SST)\nand that of CFB-SST are expressed as (1). σHFT with\ndifferent NSM.LF is shown in Table 1, the device count\nof HFTs is only 3.33% to 10% of HCFB-SST or M 2LC-\nSST in comparison with CFB-SST for single-phase\napplications.\nσHFT =1/NSM.LF (1)\n1) Comparison of device count of power switches For\nHCFB-SST, there are two kinds of power switches:\none for CFB and the other one for the secondary-side\nFB. Their device counts and the sum are expressed as\nfollows\n\n\n\nNS.CFB =4NSM.LF (1 +∂)\nNS.sFB =4\nNS =4NSM.LF (1 +∂)+4\n(2)\nTABLE 1. Ratio of device count of HFTs.\nTABLE 2. Ratio of device count of power switches.\nFor M 2LC-SST, there are also two kinds of power\nswitches: one for M 2LC and the other one for the\nsecondary-side FB. Their device counts and the sum\nare as follows\n\n\nN\n′\nS.M2LC =8NSM.LF (1 +∂)\nN\n′\nS.sFB =4\nN\n′\nS =8NSM.LF (1 +∂)+4\n(3)\nFor CFB-SST, there are three kinds of power switches:\none for CFB, one for the primary-side FB and another\none for the secondary-side FB. The device counts of\nthe three kinds of power switches and their sum are\nexpressed as (4). Although, secondary-side windings\nof HFT can be parallel-connected to reduce the device\ncount of power switches, this results in the invalidation\nof SM redundancy.\n{\nN\n′′\nS.CFB =N\n′′\nS.pFB =N\n′′\nS.sFB =4NSM.LF\nN\n′′\nS =12NSM.LF\n(4)\nThe ratios of the total device count of power switches\nof HCFB-SST corresponds to that of M 2LC-SST and\nthat of CFB-SST are calculated as (5) by using (2), (3),\nand (4). σS with different ∂is shown in Table 2, the total\ndevice count of power switches of HCFB-SST is 50%\nof that of M 2LC-SST and 44.4% to 66.7% of that\nof CFB-SST for single-phase applications. Although,\nthe secondary-side FB may use parallel-connected\npower switches to increase the current capacity in the\nHCFB-SST and the M 2LC-SST, these two topologies\nprovide a possibility to signiﬁcantly reduce the total\ndevice count of power switches by using relatively large\nrated-current power switches.\n{\nσS.1 =NS/N\n′\nS ≈1/2\nσS.2 =NS/N\n′′\nS ≈(1 +∂)/3 (5)\na) Comparison of current of power switches\nThe current of power switch (including the inverse-\nparalleled diode) is approximately calculated without\nconsidering the undesired ﬂow-back power in the HF\nlink and the harmonic currents in the bridge arm, and\nthe device count of SMs is considered as continuous\nnatural-number. Assuming the rated power of SST is\nSN, the grid-side RMS line voltage is Ug, the modula-\ntion index is m, the rated voltage of SM is USM, and the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 22121\nX.

Current is the largest in the\nHCFB-SST and the minimum in the CFB-SST. The\nsecondary-side FB current of HCFB-SST and that of\nM2LC-SST are same but much higher than that of CFB-\nSST. Combination (2), (3), (4), and Table 3, the per-\ncentage of the total current capacities required in the\nthree topologies are shown in Table 4. The total current-\ncapacity requirement of HCFB-SST is slightly larger\nthan that of M 2LC-SST, because the HF-link current of\nHCFB-SST is a sine wave whereas that of M 2 LC-SST\nis approximately a block wave, but a sine wave is good\nfor HFT.\n1) FOR MULTI-PHASE APPLICATIONS\nPower grid applications usually require multi-phase power\nconversion.

For\nthe type 1 and the extension circuits, differences are only\nthe device count of HFTs and that of the secondary-side\npower switches, therefore, results can be easily extended.\nThe following analysis is based on a set of values for the\nthree-phase power-grid applications in China: Ug =10kV,\nUs =0.75kV, USM =0.9kV, and m =0.85.

FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\nFeatures include cost saving, simple engineering, compact\nstructure, and main drawback are discussed in this section.\nA. COST SAVING\nFrom the reduced device count of HFTs, HCFB-SST can\nachieve considerable cost savings. Fig. 5 presents the price\nof 12.45 kV line-frequency power transformers with differ-\nent power capacities [1] to provide a reference of beneﬁts\nfrom reducing the device count of HFTs considering that\nMV HFTs have not been widely and practically applied.\nFig. 5 shows that using a large power-capacity line-frequency\ntransformer can achieve a 39% to 86% cost savings compared\nwith using several small ones. For high power-capacity HFTs,\nchallenges are experienced in design and manufacture, but\nsome designs and prototypes have already been developed\nby several research groups [19]. The unit-price comparison\namong different power-capacity HFTs are presented in [20],\nwhich shows more than 45% cost savings can be obtained\nby using one 8 MV A/500 Hz transformer rather than eight\n1 MV A/500 Hz ones. However, it is still difﬁcult to calculate\nthe exactly cost savings by using one high-power HFT rather\nthan several low-power ones, however, approximately sav-\nings are considerable and will increase with the development\nof HFT manufacture.\nThe increasement of the total current-capacity requirement\ndoes not mean the increasement of the overall costs, because\nthe per-current price decreases with the increment of the\ncurrent capacity of power switches. For MV applications,\nsilicon-based insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are\nwidely used, therefore, the price of IGBTs with drivers are\nstudied, as shown in Fig. 6. For Ug =10kV, Us =0.75kV,\nUSM =0.9kV, and m =0.85 applications, based on (2),\n(3), (4), Table 3, 7, and Fig. 6, the total power-switch costs\nFIGURE 5. Price of 12.45kV power transformer ([1]).\nFIGURE 6. Price of Infineon 1700 V 4th generation dual-IGBT modules\nincluding gate drivers (data come from: mouser.com).\ncomparisons are carried out with a at least 20% current\nmargin of power switches under the Tc of 108◦.\nFig. 7a to 7d exhibit the normalized total power-switch\ncosts of single-phase HCFB-SST based on the total power-\nswitch costs of single-phase M 2LC-SST, the normalized total\npower-switch costs of single-phase HCFB-SST based on the\ntotal power-switch costs of single-phase CFB-SST, the nor-\nmalized total power-switch costs of three-phase HCFB-SST\nbased on the total power-switch costs of three-phase M 2\nLC-SST, and the normalized total power-switch costs of\nthree-phase HCFB-SST based on the total power-switch costs\nof three-phase CFB-SST, respectively. The minimum power\ncapacity of SST is 0.5 MV A for single-phase applications and\n1.5 MV A for three-phase applications, as shown in Fig. 7,\nbecause the minimum current capacity of power switches is\n150A for Inﬁneon 1700V IGBT modules, as shown in Fig. 6,\nthus a small power capacity leads to much more current\ncapacity than needed. There are some large oscillations of the\nnormalized total costs of power-switches, as shown in Fig. 7,\nbecause the current capacity of power switches has reached\nthe maximum value 600A in this study, since the power\nswitches with a current capacity larger than 600 A is much\nexpensive than these with power capacity under 600 A.\nCombination the results in Fig. 7a to 7d, ∂ = 1 has the\nwidest power-capacity range for power-switch cost saving\nof HCFB-SST. For single-phase applications, HCFB-SST\nobtains a 50% to 70% cost savings within the range of\npower capacity from 0.5 MV A to 3.25 MV A compared with\nthe M 2LC-SST. Compared with the CFB-SST, HCFB-SST\nobtains a 25% to 75% cost savings of power switch within\nthe range of power capacity from 0.5 MV A to 3.25 MV A.\nFor three-phase applications, HCFB-SST obtains a 48%\nto 50% cost savings of power switch within the range of\nVOLUME 7, 2019 22123\nX. Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\nFIGURE 7. Normalized total power-switch costs of HCFB-SST.\npower capacity from 1.5 MV A to 9.75 MV A compared with\nthe M 2LC-SST. Compared with the CFB-SST, HCFB-SST\nobtains a 45% to 75% cost savings of power switch within\nthe range of power capacity from 3 MV A to 9.75 MV A.\nFrom the analysis above, power capacity of 3.25 MV A and\n9.75 MV A corresponding to single- and three-phases applica-\ntions, respectively, are the threshold of cost savings of power\nswitch.\nFrom the analysis above, the HCFB-SST can achieve con-\nsiderable cost saving of power switches compared with the\nM2LC-SST and CFB-SST in a common power range.\nThe ability of SM redundancy is one of the highlights of\nmodular converters. The cost of SM redundancy differs in\nHCFB-SST, M 2 LC-SST, and CFB-SST. As for CFB-SST,\none SM contains two FBs, one HFT, and one capacitor. As for\nHCFB-SST and M 2 LC-SST, one SM contains one FB and\none capacitor. It is obviously that without the presence of HFT\nin SM, both the HCFB-SST and the M 2LC-SST can achieve\nconsiderable cost saving of SM redundancy. Furthermore, as\nthe grid-side input-power pulsation is same in these three\ntopologies whereas the device count of SMs is not, the SM\ncapacitance is largest in CFB-SST, therefore, compared with\nCFB-SST, the HCFB-SST and the M 2LC-SST save another\ncost of SM redundancy from SM capacitor. Moreover, since\nthere are four bridge arms per phase of single-phase M 2LC-\nSST and two for multi-phase M 2LC-SST whereas that of\nHCFB-SST is only one in the type 1 and type 2 circuits,\nconsidering the redundant SMs in one bridge arm cannot be\napplied to other bridge arms, M 2LC-SST requires two- or\nfour-time device counts of redundant SMs than that of the\ntype 1 and type 2 HCFB-SST. Therefore, SM-redundancy\ncost saving of HCFB-SST comes from the elimination of\nHFT in SM, the smaller SM capacitance, and the fewer device\ncounts of redundant SMs.\nAll above, the HCFB-SST obtains a considerable cost\nsaving of power switches and SM redundancy compared with\nthe M 2LC-SST, and a considerable cost saving of power\nswitches, HFTs, and SM redundancy compared with the\nCFB-SST. As these parts of the costs are the large parts of\nthe overall costs, the HCFB-SST is less expensive than the\nM2LC-SST and CFB-SST.\nB. SIMPLE ENGINEERING\nAs there are much fewer HF links in the HCFB-SST\nthan CFB-SST, the HF-link parameter-difference problem\nof CFB-SST is eliminated in the HCFB-SST, which makes\nit simple for implementation. Besides, the HF-link power\nbalancing control [21] is also omitted thus simpliﬁes the\ncontrol system. Furthermore, the device counts of HFTs and\npower switches are smallest in the HCFB-SST compared with\nthe CFB-SST and M 2LC-SST, which makes it easier to be\nassembled. In addition, the HCFB-SST is highly modulated\nsince most of SMs belong to the primary-side CFB, thereby\nsimple for construction and repairment.\nThe HCFB-SST adopts three-stage controls which is same\nas the M 2LC-SST and CFB-SST: AC/DC control, DC/DC\ncontrol, and DC/AC control. Despite that there are some\ndifferences in topologies, the basic controls are same, which\nprovides the convenience for the software development for\nHCFB-SST. Although the AC/DC control and the DC/DC are\nboth implemented in the primary-side CFB, the two controls\nwork separately because the decoupling characteristics of\npower in different frequency.\nC. COMPACT STRUCTURE\nSince one housing of power switches usually available for\ndifferent rated current, using large current-capacity power\nswitches can increase the compatibility of SST.\nAlthough the total power-capacity of HFTs is same in the\nHCFB-SST, M2LC-SST and CFB-SST, each HFT has same\nisolation requirements so that the total volume of HFTs in\nthe CFB-SST is larger than that of HCFB-SST and that of\nM2LC-SST, due to the largest device count of HFTs.\nD. MAIN DRAWBACK\nSince the current stress is larger in the primary-side power\nswitch of HCFB-SST than that of CFB-SST, and the HF-link\npower switch of CFB-SST can achieve ZVS, the main\n22124 VOLUME 7, 2019\nX. Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\ndrawback of HCFB-SST is its power loss is higher than that of\nCFB-SST. Therefore, the semiconductor power loss analysis\nis presented in section V to provide a preliminary compari-\nson of power loss between the HCFB-SST, M 2LC-SST and\nCFB-SST.\nV. PROPOSED HYBRID-FREQUENCY MODULATION\nSeveral modulation methods can be used for\nhybrid-frequency applications as shown in Fig. 1. PSC-PWM\nprovides a high equivalent switching frequency by using low-\nfrequency phase-shifted carrier waves and ensures the most-\nbalanced average switching frequency of power switches.\nGenerally, the frequency of a carrier wave in PSC-PWM\nis at least ﬁve times higher than the highest frequency of\nthe modulation wave [22], especially for which contains\nblock voltage. This case results in an extremely high switch-\ning frequency when PSC-PWM is used to produce HF\noutputs. Nearest-level modulation (NLM) uses multi-level\ncharacteristic to reduce the harmonics, besides, it simpliﬁes\nthe voltage-balancing control by using a sorting algorithm.\nHowever, its output contains wide frequency-band harmon-\nics [23], therefore, some of them may have a frequency near\nthe resonant point of the resonant tank in the HCFB-SST,\nwhich results in the large harmonic currents in the HF link.\nA hybrid-frequency NL-PWM for CFB is proposed in [24]\nand used for CFB-SST in [25]. The modulation method\nproposed in [24] reduces the average switching frequency\ncompared with PSC-PWM and increases the frequency of\nlowest-order harmonics compared with NLM. Improvements\nof the modulation method in [24] are presented in [26]\nto extend the stable operating region. However, NL-PWM\nrequires the monitoring of the bridge-arm current, which con-\ntains the HF component in the HCFB-SST, thereby imposing\nadditional workloads on the secondary system. Similar to\nthe NLM, the NL-PWM has a relatively large dispersion of\nthe average switching frequency, which leads to a relatively\nlarge difference of SM thermal value in applications that\ncontain HF outputs, wherein the average switching frequency\nis higher than those of traditional multilevel applications.\nTo balance the average switching frequency of NL-PWM,\na switch-function-rotation algorithm is proposed in [25] on\nthe basis of SM voltages are balanced by the DABs. However,\nthe algorithm in [25] is unavailable for the proposed topology\nbecause no DAB is available for the voltage balancing of\nSMs.\nIn this section, a hybrid-frequency modulation method is\nestablished with a much lower average switching frequency\nthan PSC-PWM and a much higher equivalent switching fre-\nquency than NLM without the monitoring of bridge-arm cur-\nrent, besides, the proposed modulation method also ensures a\nwell-balanced average switching frequency.\nA. PRINCIPLE OF PROPOSED MODULATION METHOD\nAs shown in Fig. 8, the SMs in one phase output between HF\nand LF voltages. Unipolar PSC-PWM is adopted in the pro-\nposed modulation to produce the LF sine voltage considering\nFIGURE 8. Concept of proposed modulation.\nFIGURE 9. Illustration of gate-signal generation.\nboth the voltage balancing effect (discussed in section 4. B)\nand the equivalent switching frequency. In order to obtain a\nproperty function of the proposed modulation method, two\npoints are discussed below.\nB. TIME POINT OF STATE ROTATING\nTo balance the voltage of SMs, SMs rotate their outputs\nbetween HF and LF voltages, and this process is called the\nstate rotating in this study. Improper state rotating increases\nthe average switching frequency. The time point of state\nrotating is set at either the rising edge or the falling edge,\nor the both edges of the HF block voltage. The gate signal of\none power switch is shown in Fig. 9 with one SM outputting\nHF block voltage and another SM outputting LF sine voltage.\nAs shown in Fig. 9, the state rotating occurs at the rising edge\nof the HF block voltage, thereby the gate signal only rotates\nat the edges of the HF block voltage and the PWM voltage,\nthus there is no additional switching.\nC. NARROW PULSE AVOIDING\nNarrow pulses shall be avoided since they damage power\nswitches. Regular sampling can be used by PSC-PWM to\navoid narrow pulses. For the proposed modulation method,\nnarrow pulses are also produced by state rotating, as shown\nin Fig. 9. A narrow pulse avoiding control is established\nto avoid narrow pulses, as shown in Fig. 10. The input of\nthis control is the Original Gate Signal, which is obtained\nfrom the modulation block. The output is the Processed\nGate Signal, which is sent to the gate driver. The Edge-\nDetectoridentiﬁes any edge of the Processed Gate Signaland\nproduces a one-cycle high-level signal to the Mono-stable.\nThen, the Mono-stable outputs a high-level signal longer than\nthe minimum pule width allowed by the power switch when\na rising edge exists in its input. The Sampler examines the\nOriginal Gate Signalwhen EN is at a high level and holds\nits output at a low level. Thus, the Samplerholds its output\nVOLUME 7, 2019 22125\nX. Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\nFIGURE 10. Narrow pulse avoiding control.\nlonger than the minimum pule width to avoid narrow pulses\nwhen an edge exists in the Processed Gate Signal.\nD. PROPOSED VOLTAGE-BALANCING METHOD\nThere are some challenges for the SM capacitor-voltage bal-\nancing of the proposed modulation method. Several voltage-\nbalancing methods can be adopted for traditional CFBs:\n1) balancing method based on the sorting algorithm for\nNLM [27], 2) balancing method based on the feedback con-\ntroller for PSC-PWM [28], and 3) linearization balancing\nmethod for PSC-PWM [29]. For method 1, on the basis\nof the known of bridge arm’s output voltage level, real-\ntime output level acquisition of the proposed modulation\nmethod is difﬁcult because it contains PSC-PWM waves;\nFor methods 2 and 3, balancing control is implemented in\nevery carrier-wave period of PSC-PWM, but because the\noutput state of SM is rotating, in every carrier-wave period,\nSM corresponds to several carrier waves. Therefore, meth-\nods 2 and 3 are not available for the proposed modulation.\nA voltage-balancing method is established for the proposed\nmodulation method to acquire a good balancing performance\nwithout harsh requirements. Considering the limited length\nof this paper, the following analysis is based on ∂ = 1,\nwhich is recommended in this paper according to the previous\nanalysis.\nE. CAPACITOR VOLTAGE-BALANCING ANALYSIS\nThe current injection of SM is as follows\niSM =(iarm.LF +iarm.HF)SSM (10)\nThen, the capacitor charge transfer is as follows\n1QSM =\n∫\niSMdt (11)\nThe state rotating is set at edges of HF block voltage, thus,\nthere is a degree of freedom in selecting whether at the rising\nor the falling edge. Equally dividing SMs in one phase into\ntwo parts, SMs in the ﬁrst part rotates its output states at the\nrising edge of HF block voltage while SMs in the second part\ndo that at the falling edge. SMs in the two parts rotate their\noutput states in turns. Thus, the period that all the SMs have\nthe same duration in outputting HF block voltage is\nTc =ceil [(1 +1/∂)/2] Th (12)\nwhere ceil(x) returns the smallest integer no less than x.\nTc = Th when ∂ = 1. In one Tc, all eleven cases of\nboth-part SMs’ outputs are shown in Fig. 11. The LF mod-\nulation wave is no less than zero for cases a to f, whereas it\nFIGURE 11. SM’s outputs inTh.\nTABLE 9. SM charge transfer in different cases.\nis less than zero for cases g to k. For the part 1 SMs, the ﬁrst\nTh/2 corresponds to the SPWM voltage and the second Th/2\ncorresponds to the HF block voltage. For the part 2 SMs,\nit is reversed. Assuming that the Th/2 charge transfer by the\nmultiplication of HF current and HF block voltage is Qh and\nless than Th/2 is yQh (0 <y <1), and assuming that the Th/2\ncharge transfer by the multiplication of LF current and none-\nzero-level SM outputs is zQh (z ∈ R) and less than Th/2\nis zy\n′\nQh (0 <y\n′\n< 1). Supposing the grid-side power and\nthe HF-link power are in the same direction when z > 0,\nand they are in the opposite direction when z < 0. The HF\nlink current is in sine wave so that the reactive power ﬂow is\nmuch smaller than that of the quasi-rectangular wave current\nof DAB without resonant tank [30], the phase difference\nof HF-link current and voltage is ignored. The SM charge\ntransfers for every Th in each case are shown in Table 9.\nEquation (13) can be obtained when z <0, which indicates\na deﬁnite quantity relationship of charge transfer of SMs in\npart 1 and 2. Therefore, selecting the correct edge for the state\nrotating can balance the capacitor voltage.\n\n\n\n1QSM.Part1.x1 −1QSM.Part2.x2\n{\n>0,Qh <0\n<0,Qh >0\nx1,x2 =a,b,c,d,e,fz <0\n1QSM.Part1.x1 −1QSM.Part2.x2\n{\n>0,Qh >0\n<0,Qh <0\nx1,x2 =g,h,i,j,kz <0\n(13)\n22126 VOLUME 7, 2019\nX. Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\nEquation (14) can be obtained when z > 0. As shown\nin (14), a deﬁnite quantity relationship of charge transfer\nof SMs in part 1 and 2 is observed when z > 2. Two\nsituations exist when z >0: 1) In the steady state, a reactive\npower is observed in the grid side or in the HF link. 2) In\nthe dynamic state, the direction of power ﬂow is reversed.\nIn situation 1, the grid-side and HF-link reactive power of\nSST are much smaller than the active power. Thus, z < 0\nin most percentage of times. However, the reactive power\nin no-load state may be comparable with the active power,\ntherefore, it is recommended to absorb some reactive power\nfrom the grid side to ensure that z > 2 in most duration\nwithin the period of grid-side power pulsation rather than the\naddition of damping resistors in SMs. In situation 2, whenever\nthe direction of HF-link power ﬂow reverses, the direction\nof grid-side power ﬂow will reverse in a short time by DC\nvoltage control. A short-time z <2 will not negatively affect\nthe voltage balancing of SMs.\n\n\n\n1QSM.Part1.x1 −1QSM.Part2.x2\n{\n<0,Qh <0\n>0,Qh >0\nx1,x2 =a,b,c,d,e,fz >2\n1QSM.Part1.x1 −1QSM.Part2.x2\n{\n<0,Qh >0\n>0,Qh <0\nx1,x2 =g,h,i,j,kz >2\n(14)\nF. VOLTAGE-BALANCING METHOD\nOn the basis of the above analysis, voltage balancing relies on\nthe proper selecting of the transient edge for the state rotating.\nThe time point of state rotating rotates between the rising and\nfalling edges based on the transfer direction of the voltage\nband of SMs in one phase [29] to achieve a proper\nselection of the transient edge without any current sensor.\nA balancing-control method is proposed on the basis of the\nprevious analysis, as shown in Fig. 12. The capacitor volt-\nages are monitored in real time and sampled at either every\nrising edge or every falling edge of HF block modulation\nswitching function Sh. Then the SMs in the same phase are\nsorted in descending order and divided into two parts. Either\nthe 1st part or the 2dn part outputs the HF block voltage\nat the rising edge of Sh depends on the value of FLAG.\nThe voltage band of ( i-1)th sampling and ith sampling are\ncalculated and compared to determine the value of FLAG.\nBand(t) ≤band(t +Ts) indicates that the ( i-1)th balancing\ncontrol is effective or at least the voltage band did not become\nlarger. Therefore, FLAG and the time point of state rotating\nremain constant. The ith balancing control is ineffective when\nband(t) >band(t +Ts). Therefore, FLAGchanges to render\nthe next-period balancing control effective.\nThe proposed voltage-balancing method does not require\ncurrent seniors and complex calculation and can be easily\nimplanted in the ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA) to\nfurther reduce the real-time calculation burdens of digital sig-\nnal processing (DSP). Considering that the balancing-control\nfrequency is no larger than the frequency of HF block wave,\nFIGURE 12. Proposed capacitor voltage-balancing method.\nthe proposed modulation method reduces the average switch-\ning frequency especially for applications where fh is high. The\ndifference of average switching frequency is small because\nthe output state rotates among each SM. High dv/dt problem\ncomes from the block-voltage outputs by the proposed modu-\nlation can be relieved by using quasi-square-wave modulation\n(QSWM) [31].\nVI. SEMICONDUCTOR LOSS ANALYSIS\nGiven that the main drawback of HCFB-SST is the rela-\ntively rough working condition of power switches, a pre-\nliminary rated-load power loss calculation of semiconduc-\ntors of HCFB-SST is conducted as follows. Considering that\n∂ =1 has the wildest range of cost saving and the smallest\ncurrent-capacity requirement, it is recommended in this study\nand investigated through the following analysis.\nThe bridge arm current of HCFB-SST has hybrid-\nfrequency components so that the method in [32] for calculat-\ning IGBT and diode currents is unavailable for HCFB-SST.\nThus, in this work, the conduction-loss character of a diode\nis replaced by that of the IGBT to simplify the analysis. Usu-\nally, the replacement will lead to greater power-loss results.\nAccording to [32], the conduction loss of the total power\nswitches of in one phase is as follows\nPCon.p =4Nfg\n∫ Tg/2\n0\nuCEicdt =4N\n\n\n√\n2UCE0Ig\nπ +\nRt\n(\nI2\ng +I2\nr\n)\n2\n\n (15)\nwhere ic is the collector current and Ir denotes the RMS HF\ncurrent in the bridge arm. The values of UCE0 and Rt can be\nobtained from the datasheet of power switch.\nOn the basis of the proposed modulation method, switch-\ning loss consists of two parts: PSC-PWM and block-wave-\nmodulation switching losses. The block-wave-modulation\nswitching loss is mainly affected by the LF current since the\nHF current and voltage are nearly in phase. The PSC-PWM\nswitching loss may be affected by LF and HF currents. When\nVOLUME 7, 2019 22127\nX. Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\nfh/fg and Nfs/fg are even, |ic|values corresponding to the xth\nswitching of PSC-PWM in a half of Tg and the next half of\nTg are expressed as follows\n|ic.1|=\n⏐⏐ig +ir\n⏐⏐,|ic.2|=\n⏐⏐ig −ir\n⏐⏐ (16)\nOn the basis of (16), if\n⏐⏐ig\n⏐⏐ ≥|ir|, then the average |ic|of\nthe xth switching in the two halves of Tg is\n⏐⏐ig\n⏐⏐, indicating\nthat the HF current in the bridge arm has no inﬂuence on the\nswitching loss of PSC-PWM. When ∂ =1, the zone in one\nTg, which satisﬁes\n⏐⏐ig\n⏐⏐≥|ir|, is calculated by MATLAB and\naccounts for 86% of Tg. For the remaining 14% of Tg, the\naverage |ic|of the xth switching in the two halves of Tg is\n|ir|, which does not exceed\n√\n2 Ir. Therefore, the maximum\naverage switching loss and reverse recovery loss of all IGBTs\nand diodes, respectively, in one phase are as follows\n\n\n\nPS.p =2Nfh\nTg\n∫Tg/2\n0\n[\n(k1 +k3)ig +k2\n]usm\nUR\ndt\n+2Nfs\nTg\n∫0.93Tg/2\n0.07Tg/2\n[\n(k1 +k3)ig +k2\n]usm\nUR\ndt\n+4Nfs\nTg\n∫0.07Tg/2\n0\n[\n(k1 +k3)\n√\n2Ir +k2\n]usm\nUR\ndt\n=NfhUsm\nUR\n[ 2\nπ\n√\n2 Ig (k1+k3) +k2\n]\n+NfsUsm\nUR\n[(cos (0.07π)−cos (0.93π)\nπ\n×\n√\n2 Ig +7\n√\n2\n50 Ir\n)\n(k1+k3)+k2\n]\nPRec.p =2Nfh\nTg\n∫Tg/2\n0\n(\nk4ig +k5\n)usm\nUR\ndt\n+2Nfs\nTg\n∫0.93Tg/2\n0.07Tg/2\n(\nk4ig +k5\n)usm\nUR\ndt\n+4Nfs\nTg\n∫0.07Tg/2\n0\n(\nk4\n√\n2 Ir +k5\n)usm\nUR\ndt\n=NfhUsm\nUR\n( 2\nπ\n√\n2Igk4 +k5\n)\n+NfsUsm\nUR\n[(cos (0.07π)−cos (0.93π)\nπ\n×\n√\n2 Ig +7\n√\n2\n50 Ir\n)\nk4 +k5\n]\n(17)\nwhere k1, k2, k3, k4, and k5 are obtained from the ﬁtting\ncurve of the IGBT switching character and the diode reverse-\nrecovery character and UR is the IGBT-module rated voltage.\nAs the HF link operates near its resonant frequency,\nthe power switches at the secondary side can achieve\nquasi-soft\nswitching. Therefore, power loss is mainly produced by\nconduction loss and it is expressed as\nPCon.s =4Ns\n[\n2UCE0IsFB/(Nsπ)+RtI2\nsFB/Ns\n]\n(18)\nOn the basis of this analysis, the loss comparison of\npower switches is performed as follows. For single-phase\n5.77kV AC/0.75 kVDC/1 MV A, USM = 0.9kV, m of\nTABLE 10. Semiconductor selection and loss comparision.\nFIGURE 13. Semiconductor loss composition of HCFB-SST.\napproximately 0.85, fg =50Hz, fs =650Hz, and fh =10kHz\napplications, Table 10 and Fig. 13 show the power switches\nfor HCFB-SST, M 2LC-SST, and CFB-SST and the power\nloss results. Semiconductor loss of CFB-SST is calculated by\nthe method in [32]. As the M 2LC-SST has a hybrid-frequency\ncurrent in the primary-side bridge arm and a quasi-square-\nwave current in the HF link, the semiconductor loss of M 2LC-\nSST is calculated on the basis of the previous analysis and\nthe method in [32]. Table 10 shows that the semiconductor\nloss of HCFB-SST is 14.8% larger than that of CFB-SST and\n23.5% lower than that of M 2LC-SST. If the semiconductor\nloss of the LV-side DC/AC stage is considered, the semi-\nconductor loss of HCFB-SST will be near that of CFB-SST.\nThe semiconductor loss of M 2LC-SST is largest in this study\nbut can be reduced by adopting a resonant tank in the HF\nlink. Fig. 13 illustrates that the primary-side switching loss\naccounts for most of the semiconductor loss of HCFB-SST.\nThus, power loss can be reduced by using power switches\nwith a low switching loss.\nVII. SIMULATION STUDY\nThe simulation study is conducted on the basis of\nEMTDC/PSCAD, with 0.1 µs time steps. Fig. 3b presents\nthe circuit conﬁguration of the simulation model. The HV\nside of the SST is connected to a 10kV power grid, and the LV\nside of the SST is connected to three-phase resistance loads.\nThree-phase type 2 circuit is adopted because it has more\ncircuit characteristics than type 1 circuit for the additional\nprimary-side cycling current paths, besides, the extension\ncircuit is a combination of type 1 and type 2 circuits. The\nsingle-phase topology is not investigated in the followings\nsince the three-phase topology is essentially a combination\nof three single-phase topologies. Table 11 lists the simulation\nparameters.\nThe rated-load steady-state waveforms are shown\nin Fig. 14. The three-phase voltages and currents of MV AC\nare in the same phase. The currents are three-phase balanced\nand their THD is less than 0.6%. The three-phase voltages\n22128 VOLUME 7, 2019\nX. Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\nTABLE 11. Simulation parameters.\nand currents of LV AC are three-phase balanced and their\nTHDs are less than 0.4%. As shown in Fig. 14, the phase-\nA bridge-arm current contains line-frequency and HF com-\nponents, and the RMS value of bridge-arm current is 61 A,\nwhich is lower than that of the theoretical value\n√\n2ICFB =\n67.1A calculated by (6), because the power produced by\nharmonics is ignored. The maximum voltage of phase-A\nresonant capacitor is approximately 9 kV (8 kV/50 Hz +1\nkV/10 kHz), which is not difﬁcult for the manufacture. The\nvoltage of the neutral resonant capacitor is less than 2.5 kV .\nAs shown in Fig. 14, the HF-link secondary-side voltage lags\nbehind the current under single phase-shift (SPS) control,\ntherefore, the secondary-side power switches can achieve\nzero-voltage switching. The magnitude of the secondary-\nside winding current is approximately 1.9 kA, and the RMS\nvalue is 14.3 kA, which is lower than the theoretical value√\n2 IsFB = 1.48kA calculated by (6), because the power\nproduced by the harmonics is ignored. The ripple of LVDC\nvoltage is less than 0.5%, which shows a good power quality.\nFig. 15 exhibits the dynamic-state waveforms. The LV AC\nload increases from 0 to 1 MW at 2.075 s and the HF-link\nsecondary-side current and LVDC voltage reach steady state\nin 0.225 s, which shows the capability of HCFB-SST to\nhandle extreme transients.\nFig. 16 displays the simulation results of phase-A SM\ncapacitor voltages. As shown in Fig. 16a, the capacitor volt-\nages of 24 SMs are well balanced. Their maximum band is\n46.8 V and average band is 19.7 V . The capacitor voltage\nspectrum is shown in Fig. 16b, the magnitude of double-line\nfrequency harmonic voltage is 0.05 p.u. with total three-phase\n39.6 mF capacitance, which is similar to that of M 2LC-SST\nand that of CFB-SST, other low-frequency harmonics are\nFIGURE 14. Steady-state waveform.\nFIGURE 15. Dynamic-state waveform.\nsmall. As shown in Fig. 16c, the power reverses at 3.1 s,\nand the capacitor voltage reaches steady-state in 0.7 s, which\nshows a good balancing effect even under extreme tran-\nsients. As shown in Fig. 16d and 16e, the corresponding\nprimary-side DC voltage is 0.8 p.u. and 1.2 p.u., respectively,\nwhile the secondary-side DC voltage is still 1 p.u.. The\ncapacitor voltages are well-balanced even the primary-side\nvoltage and the secondary-side voltage do not satisfy the turn\nratio, which creates reactive power in the HF link. As shown\nin Fig. 16f, the capacitor voltages in rated-load and no-load\nstates are well balanced when the white noise of sensors\nhas a standard deviation ( σ) from 0% to 2%. The proposed\nbalancing method is proven to have a good anti-interference\ncapability.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 22129\nX. Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\nFIGURE 16. Results of SM capacitor voltages.\nFig. 17 presents the average switching frequencies\nof 24 SMs in phase-A with the proposed modulation method\nand the NL-PWM proposed in [24]. One of these SMs has\n0.01 p.u. more power loss than others in this study. In Fig. 17a,\nthe band of average switching frequencies with the proposed\nmodulation method is small of 38 Hz (0.71%). The average\nof 24 SMs’ average switching frequency is approximately\n5320 Hz, which satisﬁes the theoretical value of 5325 Hz\n((650 Hz ∗12+10000 Hz ∗12)/24). In Fig. 17b, the band of\nthe average switching frequencies with NL-PWM is 80Hz\n(1.47%), which is 1.1 times larger than that of the pro-\nposed modulation method. The average switching frequency\nis 5453Hz, which is 2.1% higher than that of the proposed\nFIGURE 17. Average switching frequency.\nFIGURE 18. Spectrum of bridge-arm voltage.\nmodulation method. For the conventional PSC-PWM, its\naverage switching frequency is the largest, which should\nbe 50 kHz [22] to ensure a correct HF block output. The\nproposed modulation method achieves an 89% lower average\nswitching frequency than that of the PSC-PWM.\nThe spectrum of bridge-arm voltage (without the line volt-\nage) is shown in Fig. 18. The bridge-arm voltage mainly con-\ntains 10 kHz and 15 kHz components corresponding to the HF\nblock-wave and equivalent-PWM frequencies, respectively.\nHarmonics under 10 kHz are small thus avoids the resonant-\npoint harmonic-current injection of HF link.\nFrom simulation results above, the proposed topology and\nmodulation method are validated to be well functioned.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this study, a novel modular SST family, namely,\nHCFB-SST, is presented on the basis of hybrid-frequency\nmodulation. HCFB-SST copes with various voltage levels,\npower levels, line frequencies and count of phases. Its advan-\ntages over M 2LC-SST and CFB-SST are as follows:\n1) Cost Saving: Power switches cost savings of 25%–75%\ncan be obtained compared with the M 2LC-SST. Cost\nsavings of power switches of 45%–75% and of HFTs\nof 39%–86% (based on price data of line-frequency\ntransformers) can be obtained compared with the\nCFB-SST. Considerable cost savings of SM redun-\ndancy can be obtained compared with the two other\ntopologies;\n2) Simple engineering: No parameter difference prob-\nlem of HF links, does not require HF-link power-\nbalancing control, highly modulated, and fewer circuit\ncomponents;\n3) Compact structure: Reduction of the device count\nof power switches under the same housing and\n22130 VOLUME 7, 2019\nX. Zhanget al.: HCFB-SST\nreduction of the device count of HFTs decrease the\noverall volume.\nApart from the abovementioned advantages, the semiconduc-\ntor power loss of HCFB-SST is 14.8% higher than that of\nCFB-SST in this study. Therefore, HCFB-SST is suitable for\napplications wherein the utilization rate of a power trans-\nformer is relatively low or the weight and volume of SST are\nthe most important factors.\nA hybrid-frequency modulation method is proposed for\nHCFB-SST to reduce 89% (when fh = 10 kHz) aver-\nage switching frequency compared with PSC-PWM and\nensures a higher equivalent frequency of bridge-arm out-\nput than that of NLM. In addition, the proposed modula-\ntion method does not require the monitoring of bridge-arm\ncurrent and ensures a well-balanced average switching\nfrequency.\nREFERENCES\n[1] X. She, A. Q.
