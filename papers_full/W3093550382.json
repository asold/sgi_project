Although, at the time of wr iting there is an open call for researchers\nof animal behavior by one of the oldest journal of the ﬁeld “BEH AVIOR” to report “anecdotal\nevidence of unique behavior” (\nKret and Roth, 2020 ), nowadays we see a decreasing trend of\nreporting anecdotes in scientiﬁc journals ( Ramsay and Teichroeb, 2019 ). We do not dispute the\nrelevance of publishing rare and novel behaviors or events, a s they can be important drivers for\nfuture research, but we would like to draw attention to the fa ct that these reports should follow\nsome standards and authors should be careful in avoiding ove r-interpretations.\nAn example of possible over-interpretation is a recently publishe d article (Fayet et al., 2020a ) that\nalso received a lot of media hype (e.g., 79 news outlets at the t ime of writing; for more details see\nAltmetric, 2020). The authors reported on two separate occasions (one acciden tal ﬁeld observation\nand one recorded on an 11 s long video) when two individuals of the Atlantic puﬃn ( Fratercula\narctica) were seen picking up or holding a stick in their beak, which the n touched their body. These\ntwo cases were reported as an “Evidence of tool use in a seabird” (Fayet et al., 2020a ).\nThis publication was followed by at least three commentaries [ Auersperg et al., 2020; Farrar,\n2020; von Bayern et al., 2020 ; and for further discussion see also Recommendation of the Farrar\n(2020) commentary by Dechaume-Moncharmont (2020) ] that provided partly supportive or\nalternative views on the original report. The present authors share some of the doubts presented\nearlier but in this contribution we use the above case as an ex ample to point out the problems with\nsuch anecdotal observations in general, and suggest ways to i mprove the information exchange\namong researchers.\nWHAT IS AN ANECDOTE?\nIn the study of animal behavior an anecdote may be referred to as providing an account of a\nrare behavior or event that has been observed either once or f ew times (\nSarringhaus et al., 2005 ).\nThe most critical factor to rely on this form of communicatio n is the rarity of this observation\nin comparison to other cases. It may be important to note that th e word “anecdote” is also an\nanthropomorphism because the typical deﬁnition of the anecdot e in humanities describes this form\nof storytelling as recalling an event with some moral lesson often in a humorous style.\nHowever, if the key feature of the observation is its rarity t hen it could be deﬁned also as an\nanomaly, that is, something unexpected and/or diﬀerent from t ypical situations. Note that this\ndiﬀerence is not only playing with words. Reporting an anomaly wo uld lessen the burden of\nSándor and Miklósi How to Report Anecdotal Observations?\nthe observer to present an “explanation” (“the lesson of the\nstory”). In addition, it underlines the need to establish a b aseline\nfor comparison to the “typical” situation. Most anecdotes repor t\ncases when the animal’s behavior implies some speciﬁc and/or\ncomplex new feature based on the assumption that this habit is\nadvantageous (in terms of ﬁtness) both for the individual an d the\nspecies. However, one should also consider that an anomaly cou ld\nalso be disadvantageous, and may represent a malfunctioning .\nHowever, we also noted that “anomaly” has a negative\nconnotation in many ﬁelds of biology and medicine, thus we\nsuggest to refer to behavioral rarity instead of an anecdote or\nanomaly (see below). We are aware that the term “anecdote” ha s\na long history in animal behavior but terminological clariﬁ cation\ncan often lead to improvements in research quality. The new ter m\nexpresses both the rare or single occurrence of the observati on\nbut at the same time refers to this event as having a particular\nvalue (for future research).\nSome authors also refer to such reports as “anecdotal\nevidence” (\nKret and Roth, 2020 ). One may ask what does\n“evidence” mean in this context? Something may be either\n“anecdotal” or evidence based. In the case of the former\nthe report is based on a subjective account provided by the\nobserver (but see issues on the accuracy of witness reports, e .g.,\nItsukushima et al., 2002 ). In the latter case the observation may\nbe supported by data that do not represent evidence per se but\nhave evidential value in relation to some claims, and that ar e\nas much as possible independent from identity of the observer.\nSuch additional information may come from pictures, videos\netc. published databases or papers from other researchers. Tod ay\nit may be a minimum condition to provide video data for all\nreported anecdotes but even in such cases one may refrain from\nusing the word “evidence” (see below).\nWith these general considerations about anecdotal reports i n\nmind, in the following section we present an analysis and criti cal\nevaluation of the 11 s long observation on one puﬃn, provided\nby\nFayet et al. (2020a) .\nDESCRIBING BEHAVIOR\nIn case of reporting observations on animal behavior the accu rate\ndeﬁnition and description is a must. Unfortunately, this is of ten a\nweak point in many studies in which the authors do not provide\nadequate deﬁnitions, and the detailed description of the beh avior\nis also missing.\nIn the original publication\nFayet et al. (2020a) write “ adult\npuﬃn picks up a wooden stick from the ground then uses it to\nscratch its chest feathers. ” Watching the same video\nAuersperg\net al. (2020) indicate that the bird “ simply accidentally touched its\nplumage with the stick while bringing it toward its breast. ” In their\nreply the authors ( Fayet et al., 2020b ) extend their description\nby adding”. . . Its head stops in time such that the stick neither\nbumps against the body nor shifts/dislodges from the beak, an d\nupon contact the head moves side to side in a scratching motio n.”\nThe basic problem here is mixing up the levels of analysis.\nAuersperg et al. (2020) use descriptive terminology, while Fayet\net al. (2020b) refer to the action sequence as if it had some\nfunction (“scratching”). Importantly, there is general con sensus\nthat scratching has some function, e.g., by removing parasit es\n(Bush and Clayton, 2018 ). However, for an objective analysis of\nany behavior the former is the preferred approach, especially if\nthere are uncertainties about the interpretation. Also, note that\nFayet et al. fail to provide a deﬁnition of scratching in the or iginal\npaper and also in their responses (\nFarrar, 2020; Fayet et al.,\n2020b).\nIndeed, we could not ﬁnd good deﬁnitions and descriptions of\nsimilar actions for puﬃns and other bird species in the publishe d\nliterature. Thus, we decided to look through more than 40 vid eos\n(available on youtube) to identify action sequences that appe ar to\nbe similar and might reﬂect “scratching” in various bird spec ies.\nGenerally, this analysis led us to conclude that (1) scratchi ng\n(as distinguished from preening) consists of many usually a very\nrapid, repeated (stereotyped) movements ( <1 s long), (2) it aims\nat a speciﬁc anatomical region of the body, (3) the body part (leg\nor beak) or the tool used for the action exerts some force on th e\nskin surface (\nAuersperg et al., 2020 ).\nIn addition, we also reviewed numerous videos on scratching\nand preening behavior in Atlantic puﬃns, and then analyzed\n7 videos frame by frame (for more details, see ESM, Part I\nand Supplementary Table 1,\nSándor, 2020a ). Based on these\nanalyses, we concluded that puﬃns use their feet to repeatedly\nrub (scratch) parts of their bodies which they do not reach wit h\ntheir beak (e.g., head, neck), by moving it very rapidly in clos e\ncontact with their body surface.\nIn all other cases, their beaks were used in two diﬀerent ways:\n(1) they immersed their beak deep into the feathers and made\nsmall sidewise or up and down movements, and (2) they dragged\nthe breast feathers one or more times between the mandibles o f\nthe beak (preening). We conclude that all of the analyzed acti ons\nwere in all important aspects very diﬀerent from that reported\nby\nFayet et al. (2020a, for more details, see ESM, Part I), as\n“scratching.”\nWhile looking for the videos for the above analysis, we also\nnoticed that puﬃns shake their heads regularly and it is not\nuncommon for them to do so when they are holding nest\nmaterial in their beak. Therefore, we also analyzed 7 videos\nin which puﬃns shake their heads with and without nest\nmaterial in their beak. After a detailed description of their action\nsequences (see ESM, Part II and Supplementary Table 2,\nSándor,\n2020b), we conclude that these actions are more similar to\nthe video published by Fayet et al. (2020a) than scratching or\npreening behaviors.\nEven this short behavioral analysis provided important data\nfor the possible interpretation of the behavior. Note that in th e\nESM we also reveal some data that picking up sticks is actually\nnot so rare in puﬃns (for a similar argument see\nDechaume-\nMoncharmont, 2020 ) thus the observed behavior could be also\nrelated to some nest building activity.\nCAUSAL INTERPRETATIONS\nIn their response to\nFarrar (2020) , the authors indicate that it\nis unlikely that “ two cases we observed in puﬃns occurred by\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 555487\nSándor and Miklósi How to Report Anecdotal Observations?\nchance.” Unfortunately, this remark represents a typical fallacy\nthat gives strong arguments to those who object to publicatio n\nof such records. The observation that on weekends about 40\npeople win some kind of lottery in the European countries\ndoes not mean that they can foretell the future. Importantly,\nthe authors may be right (or wrong) but this is a dead end\nfor the debate.\nAuersperg et al. (2020) , Farrar (2020) , and\nthe present authors ﬁnd it just as likely that the witnessed\nobservations is the outcome of chance events. Accordingly,\nan alternative explanation is that the bird picked up a stick\nand then suddenly shook the head or tried to scratch (or\npreened) its feathers (see above) but the stick in its beak act ually\nhindered the execution of the action. Furthermore, note tha t\nboth observations on puﬃns were interpreted as providing\nsome beneﬁt for the actor. Just for the sake of it, why is\nit less likely that both birds suﬀered from a “stick-picking\nsyndrome?” This could be a malformation of the behavior when\nfor some presently unknown reason, some puﬃns cannot stop\ntaking regularly sticks into their beaks. Although this ide a may\nsound odd, so far nobody proposed any argument that could\nexclude it.\nThe claim about tool use is a very critical one because\nFayet et al. (2020a) notes that this observation may indicate\nseabirds “ possessing sophisticated cognitive abilities. ” However,\nit is not clear what they mean by this hypothesis. First,\nit is not supported by the behavioral analysis (see above),\nsecond, interactions with objects do not need to be controll ed\nby complex cognitive processes. Although, we agree with\nDechaume-Moncharmont (2020) that reports on observations\nof animal behavior should not become the “victim of Morgan’s\ncanon, ” alternative (simpler) explanations should be given\nsimilar attention. Cognitive abilities, as any other trait s,\nshould be subjected to a thorough experimental analyis\nbefore serious claims can be made. If the presently reported\nbehavior was a combination of nest-building and scratching\nactions then there is no need to assume any sophisticated\ncognitive skill.\nEVOLUTIONARY INTERPRETATIONS\nAn important point of\nFayet et al. (2020a) report is to understand\nthe evolution of the cognitive aspects of behavior. However,\nrare and likely accidental behaviors, like this one displayed\nby the puﬃn, do not need evolutionary explanations until\ntheir function and potential beneﬁt has not been established\n(see above).\nSince novelty is a relative term, we would be very reluctant\nto describe such an example as novel based on a single (or\ntwo) observation. The signiﬁcant aspect of the observed beha vior,\npicking up an elongated object, is very likely part of nest\nbuilding behavior in puﬃns that has been probably subject\nof stabilizing selection. Accordingly, it is normal or expec ted\nthat puﬃns pick up objects accidentally (see also\nAuersperg\net al., 2020 ), and they may become part of other on-going\nactivities, especially before or after the main nesting seas on. So\nhaving more time to observe puﬃns’ behavior, we may ﬁnd\nother instances of odd interactions with various types of obj ects\nbut this does not conﬁrm the presence of speciﬁc selective\n(evolutionary) processes.\nBEHAVIORAL RARITY AS A RESULT OF\nENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS\nThe role of the rearing and living environment should also\nbe taken seriously because it may contribute to the emergence\nof various behaviors. However, it is a realistic possibility\nthat such a speciﬁc or even seemingly novel trait is fully\ndependent on the environment, that is, there is no genetic\nvariation present, so its role in the evolution of the species\nis questionable.\nKeas may provide an example for this case. They are\napparently very skillful tool users in captivity (e.g.,\nAuersperg\net al., 2010 ) but only very few such observations have been\nobserved in nature ( Auersperg et al., 2015 , but see Goodman\net al., 2018 , for rare but systematic observation on kea tool use\nin the wild). One explanation could be that in keas tool use may\nemerge under very speciﬁc conditions spontaneously, and that it\nis not inﬂuenced by genetic variation.\nAlthough parrots are often credited with being eﬃcient tool\nusers (\nAuersperg et al., 2018 ), the overall majority of such\nobservations were done on captive individuals. Interesting ly,\nFayet et al. (2020a) also mention that parrot may use objects\nfor scratching their head or back. However, videos availabl e\nsuggest that scratching with objects is actually very diﬀere nt\nfrom scratching with leg in parrots. The former action is\ncarried out much slower and is reminiscent to kind of self-\nmassage. Until this behavior is not observed in nature and\nwithout further detailed analysis, parrot tool using for scra tching\ntheir body should not amount to claims that this behavior is\npart of the typical natural ethogram. Thus, what we see on\nthese videos is not an evolutionary signiﬁcant invention bu t a\nspontaneous manifestation of a behavior under speciﬁc condit ion\nby a few individuals.\nWe should acknowledge that the speciﬁc facilitative\nrole of the environment can be excluded in the puﬃns’\ncase because sticks are probably typical features of\ntheir habitat.\nBEHAVIORAL RARITY AS A RESULT OF\nDEVELOPMENTAL NOISE\nThe concept of developmental noise has been introduced to\nexplain phenotypic variation with individuals of the same\ngenotype based on stochastic processes at the molecular\nlevel (e.g.,\nWillmore and Hallgrímsson, 2005 ). Speciﬁc traits\n(extremes) emerging as a result of such variation are not\ninherited and thus do not contribute to the evolution of the\nspecies. Such individuals may be re-occurring in the population\nbut their rate depends solely on the actual environment\nand the trait cannot be selected for.\nLinneweber et al.\n(2020) have provided a convincing case that due to non-\nheritable asymmetry of some special neuron cluster in the\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 555487\nSándor and Miklósi How to Report Anecdotal Observations?\nDrosophila brain, some individuals perform much better in\ntasks requiring visual orientation. They argue that intrin sically\nstochastic processes lead to some individuals with “outstand ing”\nskills that are stable over their life time. Obviously, one ca n\nclaim that such skills are still within the capacity of the\nDrosophila species but this variation does not contribute to\ntheir evolution.\nThus, based on the above argument, both puﬃns in the\nreport could represent such rare (“anomalous”) individuals\n(see also above) that may be specially interested in interact ing\nwith sticks, and eventually “get scratched/touched” by the m.\nIt follows, however, then in this case they should display this\nactivity regularly.\nFROM BEHAVIORAL RARITIES TO CASE\nSTUDIES\nResearch practices change over time, and what seemed to\nbe useful many years ago, might not provide beneﬁts in\nthe future. With the advent of (video) camera traps, we see\na large number of videos showing so far unreported and\nunlikely sequences of interactions between animals within and\nbetween various species. Many of such observations could\nbe important for generating new hypotheses (\nDechaume-\nMoncharmont, 2020 ), however, before attributing evolutionary\nsigniﬁcance to them, one has to conﬁrm the prevalence of the\nbehavior within and between individuals, and also aim to tak e\ncontrol over it (observe it) under more controlled conditio ns.\nNote that thousands of hours of behavior recordings increas e\nthe chance to observe any kind of rarities (anomalies). Thus, the\nreluctance of journals to publish such reports is understanda ble\n(\nRamsay and Teichroeb, 2019 ).\nHowever, there are ways to solve this issue by moving\nfrom anecdotes to behavioral rarities (again, the change in the\nlabel would point to a more objective position) and even to\nreport so-called case studies which include a more objective\nmethodology and analysis. We also suggest that reporting\nbehavioral rarities by providing pure descriptions without an y\nfurther analysis of available data should not be regarded\nas publications.\nIn contrast, case studies represent a widely accepted method\nfor scientiﬁc investigations, in medicine, sociology etc. a nd\nover the years this type of research underwent methodologica l\nreforms (e.g.,\nLevy, 2008; Thomas, 2011 ). Thus we encourage the\nresearch community of animal behavior to aim for publishing\ncase studies rather than behavioral rarities (formally know n\nas anecdotes).\nTOWARD STANDARDIZATION OF CASE\nSTUDIES IN ANIMAL BEHAVIOR\nIn order to facilitate information exchange among research ers,\navoid or minimize misunderstandings and unnecessary\ndebates, we make a ﬁrst attempt to provide a non-exhaustive\ncheck list of aspects that should be considered for the\npreparation of a publication on behavioral rarities. Note\nthat to some extent these points follow Tinbergen’s 4\nquestions, and many of them have been suggested by\nvarious scholars earlier. We only made a compilation of\nthese insights:\nBehavioral analysis (accompanied by video recordings)\n• Describe the observed actions/interactions in detail:\nWhat is the animal doing with its leg, body,\nhead etc?\n• Deﬁne the behavior and if any function is implicated, indicat e\nthe supposed beneﬁt: What is the most appropriate label for\nthis sequence of actions?\n• Review the relevant literature on the target species or relate d\nspecies and provide a comparative analysis at the behavioral\nlevel (or give a statement that there exists no data to the best\nknowledge of the authors).\nFunctional analysis and hypotheses\n• What is the possibility that the behavior occurred by\nchance? Provide estimates of baseline frequency of similar\nbehaviors and actions (data from other species could be\nalso informative)\n• Consider the beneﬁt of the action for the individual, and\ncompare it with alternative behaviors that may lead to simila r\nadvantageous outcomes\n• Discuss the possible disadvantages of this behavior or the\npossibility of behavioral malformation\n• Provide long-term or repeated observations on a\nsingle individual\n• Search for similar reports attributing function\nin the same or other species (from the wild\nor captivity).\nCognitive analysis and hypotheses\n• Consider whether the observation is detailed and precise\nenough to make any assumptions on the underlying\nmental processes\n• Argue why a more complex hypothesis on\nthe mental processes has a higher probability\nto explain the observed behavior, and provide\nalternative explanations\n• Suggest (and execute) possible ways (experiments) to\ntest the phenomenon under more controlled laboratory\nconditions or by some planned manipulation at the site of\nthe observation\n• Consider whether particular aspects of the\ndevelopment (e.g., captivity) may make this\nobservation special.\nEvolutionary considerations\n• Based on the above answers, discuss critically whether the\nobserved behavior had or has the potential to play a role in\nthe evolution of the species\n• What particular aspects of the development (e.g., captivity)\nmay make this observation special?\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 555487\nSándor and Miklósi How to Report Anecdotal Observations?\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nÁM and KS conceived the idea of this opinion together and wrote\nthe text.
