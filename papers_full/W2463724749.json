Several approaches,\nbased on the analysis of displacement monitoring data, have been\nproposed in recent years to deal with the issue. Among these, the\ninverse velocity method surely demonstrated its effectiveness in\nanticipating the time of collapse of rock slopes displaying acceler-\nating trends of deformation rate. However, inferring suitable linear\ntrend lines and deducing reliable failure predictions from inverse\nvelocity plots are processes that may be hampered by the noise\npresent in the measurements; data smoothing is therefore a very\nimportant phase of inverse velocity analyses. In this study, differ-\nent filters are tested on velocity time series from four case studies\nof geomechanical failure in order to improve, in retrospect, the\nreliability of failure predictions: Specifically, three major landslides\nand the collapse of an historical city wall in Italy have been\nexamined. The effects of noise on the interpretation of inverse\nvelocity graphs are also assessed. General guidelines to conve-\nniently perform data smoothing, in relation to the specific char-\nacteristics of the acceleration phase, are deduced. Finally, with the\naim of improving the practical use of the method and supporting\nthe definition of emergency response plans, some standard proce-\ndures to automatically setup failure alarm levels are proposed. The\nthresholds which separate the alarm levels would be established\nwithout needing a long period of neither reference historical data\nnor calibration on past failure events.\nKeywords Time of failure . Alarm threshold . Early\nwarning . Monitoring . Inverse velocity\nIntroduction and rationale for the study\nMonitoring slopes potentially affected by instability is an activity\nof fundamental importance in the field of geomechanics. The\ninterpretation of monitoring data is one of the main point of\nemphasis when trying to predict the time of geomechanical failure\n(T\nf) or to assess the probability of an imminent rock slope col-\nlapse. Although a universal law which successfully accomplishes\nthis goal for all the types of failure mechanisms and lithology does\nnot exist, a good number of empirically derived methods and\nequations have been produced in the last decades. These are\nusually based on the recurrent observation before failure of certain\nrelationships in the strain or displacement data, eventually linked\nto some intrinsic properties of the rock mass (Ventura et al. 2009).\nFor example, Mufundirwa et al. (2010 ) evaluated T\nf as the slope of\nthe t(du/dt)-du/dt curve, where du/dt is the displacement rate.\nNewcomen and Dick ( 2015) recently reported the Bboundary\nconditions^ for different failure mechanisms based on the correla-\ntion between the Rock Quality Mass (RMR) index and the observed\nhighwall strain percentage. Federico et al. ( 2012) presented 38 case\nstudies where velocity and acceleration were measured up to the\ns l o p ec o l l a p s ea n df o u n dt h a ti n those instances, a common\nrelationship between the logarithms of these two parameters is\napproximately satisfied just prior to failure. The most diffused ap-\nproaches for T\nf prediction are those based on the accelerating creep\ntheory, which has been repeatedly studied by different authors under\nslightly different perspectives (Saito 1969; Fukuzono 1985;C r u d e n\nand Masoumzadeh 1987; Crosta and Agliardi 2003) and from which\nderives that the time of slope failure can be predicted by extrapolat-\ning the trend towards zero of the inverse velocity-time plot. The most\nnotorious description of the topic was made by V oight ( 1988, 1989),\nwho extended the theory to the behaviour of materials in terminal\nstages of failure and proposed a relation between displacement rate\nand acceleration, influenced by two dimensionless parameters ( A\nand α):\nΩI\n−α\nΩII−Α ¼ 0 ð1Þ\nwhere Ω is the observed displacement and the dot refers to differen-\ntiation with respect to time (i.e. Ω\n:\nrepresents velocity and ΩII acceler-\nation). He then provided an analytical solution for the forecast of Tf\nt h a tm a yb eu t i l i z e de s p e c i a l l ywhen the inverse velocity plot ap-\nproaches zero with a striking non-linear trend (perfect linearity is\nverified for α = 2), which would make more uncertain the use of the\ngraphical solution. A and α are not necessarily constants and can\nchange if different time increments are considered (V oight 1988;\nCrosta and Agliardi 2003); V oight (1988), in fact, supposed that the\nmechanisms of deformation and the conditions of loading are time\ninvariant, an assumption which may very well not agree with reality.\nThe accuracy of the analytical methodi st h u sh e a v i l yi n f l u e n c e db yt h e\nprecision and frequency of the monitoring data (V oight1989). Anyway,\nexperience suggested (Fukuzono 1985;V o i g h t1988, 1989)t h a t α is\nfrequently nearly equal to 2, which made linear fitting of inverse\nvelocity-time data a simple and much preferred tool to predict T\nf of\nslopes displaying strong acceleration phases. Petley et al. ( 2002) ob-\nserved that the form of the inverse velocity plot is in fact predomi-\nnantly linear for landslides where generation of a new shear surface\nand crack propagation are the dominant processes. Rose and Hungr\n(2007) also assessed that the inverse velocity plot often approaches\nlinearity, especially during the final stages of failure; they also\nhighlighted the need to seek consis tent linear trends in the data and\ntheir changes. On this subject, Dick et al. ( 2014) suggested that the\nlinear fitting procedure should only include data following the identi-\nfication of Onset Of Acceleration (OOA) points; they also advised that\nadditional fitting should be performed if a TU point (Trend Update,\ni.e. significant change in the acceleration trend) is detected.\nHere, we are not attempting to give a review of the methods briefly\ndescribed above. Certainly, the inverse velocity method (INV) has\nbecome a widely applied tool for failure prediction and the simplicity\nof use is its most powerful feature. Nevertheless, INV has some\nLandslides 14 & (2017)\n517\nOriginal Paper\nimportant limitations and its application requires experienced users.\nIn particular, INV can be used only for slopes which fail in accordance\nto the accelerating creep theory, excluding, for example, cases of\nstructural (Mufundirwa et al. 2010) or brittle (Rose and Hungr 2007)\nfailure. Rose and Hungr ( 2007) provided a list of elements that can\ncause variation of displacement rates and thus hamper the perfor-\nmances of INV . The theoretical method was actually obtained from\nconstant and controlled laboratory conditions, which are extremely\nunlikely to be satisfied on natural slopes and field conditions. Such\nlimitations can include measurement errors and random instrumental\nnoise, local slope movements, variation of the displacement rates\ndriven by periodically changing factors (e.g. rainfall, groundwater,\nsnowmelt, human activities, etc.), α significantly diverging from 2,\nand lack of clear OOA and TU points acceptably earlier than the\noccurrence of the failure event. Moreover, INV assumes that velocity\nat failure is infinite; this condition is obviously not verified and in fact\nvelocity at failure varies for different rock types, volumes, mechanisms\nof failure and slope angles (Newcomen and Dick 2015). All these\nelements can decisively hamper the interpretation of the inverse\nvelocity plot, thus affecting the accuracy and reliability of T\nf predic-\ntions and eventually discouraging users from using the method during\nthe monitoring program.\nFor these reasons, it is of crucial importance to correctly pro-\ncess the velocity time series in order to remove as much as possible\nthese disturbing effects, which here are generally termed Bnoise^\nfor simplicity. Data filtering is indeed essential to help locating\nOOA and TU and to increase the degree of fitting of the linear\nregression line (growth of the coefficient of determination R\n2 on\nthe inverse velocity plot is usually a good indicator that an accel-\neration phase is occurring at the slope). In this paper, we make\nreference to two types of noise:\n– BInstrumental noise ^ (IN), caused by the accuracy of the mon-\nitoring instrument\n– BNatural noise ^ (NN) that includes all the other afore-\nmentioned factors causing possible divergence of the slope\nmovements from the theoretical linear behaviour of the inverse\nvelocity plot towards failure, as derived from Fukuzono ’s and\nV oight’s models\nTo our knowledge, a detailed study devoted to testing different\nmethods of data smoothing on a collection of case histories in\norder to thoroughly evaluate their performances, determine the\neffects of noise on the reliability of T\nf predictions and eventually\nobtain related guidelines for an optimal utilization of INV does\nnot appear to have been yet produced to date. Dick et al. (2014)\ncarried out a sensitivity analysis for an open pit mine slope failure\ncase history, which showed that variation of T\nf for rates filtered\nover a short time period produced larger variations compared to\nrates filtered over a longer time period; however, the topic was not\ncomprehensively examined as in the terms proposed here, and the\nmain focus was directed towards the correct handling of spatially\ndistributed ground-based radar data in monitoring open pit mine\nslopes. It should also be noted that different filters may generate\ndifferent results depending on the shape of the rate acceleration\ncurve and on the level of noise intensity. Therefore, testing should\nbe performed on various types of case studies.\nIn the following section, we consider and execute data smooth-\ning on velocity data from three landslide case histories and extend\nthe analysis also to the collapse of a man-made structure of\nsignificant cultural heritage. Each of these events (all in Italy)\ndisplayed a noticeable accelerating trend towards failure. In par-\nticular, the episodes considered are:\n1. The Mount Beni rockslide (December 2002), characterized in\ngeneral by low-medium values of slope velocities approaching\nthe event (A ≈ 0.1; see later sections)\n2. The catastrophic Vajont landslide (October 1963), which was\nanticipated by extremely high movement rates ( A ≈ 0.04;\nV oight1988)\n3. A roto-translational slide on a volcanic debris talus (Stromboli\nV olcano, August 2014)\n4. The collapse of a section of medieval walls in the historical\ntown of V olterra (March 2015)\nA f t e r w a r d s ,w ec r e a t et w oi d e a lv e l o c i t yt i m es e r i e si na g r e e m e n t\nwith V oight’s model and we introduce on them a set of randomly\ngenerated low- and high-intensity noise; consequently, we evaluate the\nresulting effects on the performances of INV and apply data smooth-\ning. Finally, based on the experience acquired from both the real and\nsimulated case studies, we propose some procedures for a practical\nanalysis of the inverse velocity plots. These proposed guidelines ad-\ndress both the aspect of data handling and the issue of objectively\nestablishing the alarm setup process for the emergency plan.\nMethodology\nAs previously mentioned, the most powerful feature of INV is prob-\nably its simplicity. Under many aspects, it is of great advantage, in\nscenarios of risk assessment and management, if users can rely on\nquick and practical methods to evaluate the state of the monitored\nphenomenon and determine the possibility of an imminent calam-\nitous event, a task which is not always possible to accomplish\nbecause of physical reasons and/or technological constraints. Ac-\ncordingly, we tested two among the most common and easy-to-use\nsmoothing algorithms, i.e. the moving average and the exponential\nsmoothing. Specifically, we considered three forms of filter:\n1. A short-term simple moving average (SMA), where the\nsmoothed velocity at time t is:\nvt ¼ vt þ vt−1 þ ⋯ þ vt− n−1ðÞ\nn ð2Þ\nand n =3\n2. A long-term simple moving average (LMA), where n = 7 in (2 )\n3. An exponential smoothing function (ESF), where\nvt ¼ β⋅vt þ 1−βðÞ ⋅vt−1 ð3Þ\nand the smoothing factor is β = 0.5\nIf the time interval between adjacent measurements is constant,\nthe type of moving average as in (2 ) is equivalent to the simple\nequation utilized by Dick et al. (2014)\nvi ¼ di−di−n\nti−ti−n\nð4Þ\nOriginal Paper\nLandslides 14 & (2017)518\nwhere ti is the most recent time and di is the most recent cumu-\nlative value of displacement.\nObviously, there is no formally correct rule or procedure in order to\nestablish the order of the moving averages. In fact, this is highly\ndependent on data quality and temporal frequency. High acquisition\nrates, which in the field of slope monitoring are typical of advanced\nremote sensing techniques (e.g. ground-based radar, GPS and total\nstations), usually require to perform smoothing over a greater number\nof measurements. Conversely, low acquisition rates will hide much of\nthe background noise, causing on the other hand the inability to trace\nshort-term movements and delaying the identification of eventual\ntrend changes; in such instance, smoothing should thus be performed\nover relatively less measurements, compared to data obtained at high\nacquisition rates. It follows that the number of data points within the\ntime series does not necessarily influence in a significant way the\naccuracy of failure predictions. It is difficult to determine a priori the\nminimum number of acquisitions, in addition to those necessary to\napply the aforementioned filters (i.e.n), that is required to confidently\nextrapolate linear trends in the inve rse velocity plot. Undoubtedly, a\npopulated data set will help determine more clearly how well the time\nseries is fitted by the linear regression line, thus giving an important\nindication about the reliability of the prediction. In any case, modern\nmonitoring technologies, which can measure displacements several\ntimes per day, ensure that the form e ri sn ol o n g e rac o m m o ni s s u ea n d\ntypically provide users with a more than acceptable amount of data\npoints in the time series, unless the mo nitoring activities are initiated\nextremely close to the failure event.\nWith reference to the failure events presented in this paper, which\nwere mostly characterized by low acquisition rates of the displace-\nments (about 1 measurement/day or less), using values of n >7i n( 2)\nseemed to level out excessively the trend changes which were actually\ndue to OOAs. Moreover, the wider the temporal window over which\nsmoothing is performed, the higher the lag that is introduced to the\ntime series; consequently, in scenarios of near-real time monitoring, it\nis probably not practical or convenient to use windows of smoothing\nwhich span over too long time periods. Considering the aforemen-\ntioned acquisition rates of the reviewed data, a LMA withn = 7 seems a\nreasonable compromise. Regarding the SMA, Eq. ( 2)w i t hn =3 i s\ntypically considered the most basic filter for smoothing a hypothetical\no u t l i e ri nal i n e a rt i m es e r i e s ;t h i smoving average responds quickly to\ntrend changes and is sensitive to slight fluctuations in the data. For this\nreason, it is selected for comparison to the Bslower^ and less sensitive\nLMA. This work is not focused on determining if a certain value ofn is\nthe most ideal for treating displacement measurements, since this will\ncertainly vary from case to case depending on several factors such as\nacquisition rate, landslide velocity and background noise. As described\nmore thoroughly in the following sections, both short- and long-term\nmoving averages provide in fact benefits and downsides in time series\nanalysis; the intent is therefore to evaluate how these properties\ninfluence the reliability of failu re predictions and if short-term or\nlong-term moving averages should be preferred for the application\nof the inverse velocity method.\nFinally, in (3), a smoothing factor of 0.5 maintains a good balance\nbetween smoothing effect and sensitivity to trend changes in the\ndata. An ESF has the form of a geometric progression and therefore,\ndifferently from a moving average, takes into account all past data,\nwith recent observations having greater weight than older ones.\nResults\nFailure case histories\nMt. Beni rockslide\nOn 28 December 2002, a landslide occurred on the Eastern flank of\nMt. Beni (Central Italy), on a slope which had been previously\nexploited by quarrying activity until the 1980s (Fig. 1a). The failure\nmechanism, involving jointed massive basalts overlying ophiolitic\nbreccias, was characterized by a volume of about 500,000 m\n3 and\nhas been classified as a rockslide/rock topple (Gigli et al. 2011).\nSeveral distometric bases were put in place along the perimetral\ncrack (Fig. 1b) and recorded cumulative displacements since April\n2002. Increasing rates, ranging from few millimetres up to few\ncentimetres per day, were detected by most of the devices starting\nfrom September 2002 until the collapse of 28 December. According\nto eyewitnesses, the event began at about 4:30 a.m. local time. Gigli\net al. (2011 ) made particular reference to distometric base 1-2, since\nthis recorded the longest and most consistent progressive acceler-\nation in the time series of displacements; they ultimately calculat-\ned a failure forecast according to the linear extrapolation of the\ntrend in the inverse velocity plot, which could be distinguished\nsince 2 August already (Fig. 2a). Although it provides a good\nestimate that failure is going to occur, fitting of these data gives\na T\nf which anticipates the actual failure (T af) by 4 days and a half\n(ΔTf = Taf-Tf = 4.5), as is also shown by the related life expectancy\nplot in Fig. 3a.L i f ee x p e c t a n c yp l o t sa r ev e r yu s e f u lt o o l st o\nexamine the course with time of the Tf predictions, updated on\nan on-going basis each time a new measurement is available\n(Mufundirwa et al. 2010; Dick et al. 2014).\nInverse velocity plots for data filtered by means of SMA, LMA\nand ESF are given in Fig. 2. In this case, short-term moving average\nsmoothing eliminates the small steps in the raw data curve, yield-\ning a significantly improved T\nf (ΔTf = 1.1); on the other hand, long-\nterm moving average, despite determining a slightly better fitting,\ngenerates a considerably negative ΔT\nf (−4.3) and most importantly\ndelays the identification of the OOA point by 1 month. The latter\naspect is verified even more for the exponentially smoothed ve-\nlocities. Their poor linearity would have also made their use in the\nemergency scenario quite troublesome, even if, in retrospect, it is\nfound that the last T\nf value is highly accurate. Respective life\nexpectancy plots (Fig. 3) display additional, valuable information:\nAll datasets, beside velocities filtered by means of ESF, converge\np a r a l l e lt ot h ea c t u a lt i m et of a i l u r el i n e .H o w e v e r ,r a wd a t a\nconsistently give anticipated forecasts of the time of failure, where-\nas SMA allows forecasts to get decisively closer to the actual failure\nline since November 21. In Fig. 3c, predictions approach the actual\nvalues already on late October but finally diverge towards signif-\nicantly negative ΔT\nf, which is something to avoid in risk manage-\nment of geological hazards (concept of Bsafe^ and Bunsafe ^\npredictions, Mufundirwa et al. 2010). Exponential smoothing pro-\nduces a reliable Tf in correspondence of the last measurement, but\nthe predicted time to failure line does not have a regular pattern, if\ncompared to the others.\nA slightly different, but really interesting example from the Mt.\nBeni rockslide, which is not reported in Gigli et al. (2011 ), is given\nby displacement rates measured at the distometric base 15-13.\nEspecially in its last phase, the final acceleration (Fig. 4a) is quite\nLandslides 14 & (2017) 519\nirregular (i.e. progressive-regressive wall movement; Newcomen\nand Dick 2015). Moreover, it seems to have a slightly concave\nshape with respect to base 1-2, possibly suggesting α lower than\n2. We may thus refer these features to one or more of the natural\nnoise factors. The reliability of the linear fitting of the inverse\nvelocity graph results to be strongly affected and produces a time\nof failure forecast which precedes the last actual measurement\nacquired on December 20, hence well ahead of T\naf\n(approximately 8 days, Figs. 4a and 5a). Here, SMA does not\nexhibit a noticeable improvement in terms of smoothing, and the\nconsequent T\nf is equivalent to Tf from raw data. Again, exponen-\ntial smoothing introduces irregularity on the plot and delays the\nOOA point. In this case, filtering by means of the long-term\nmoving average produces better results under every aspect: OOA\nis found at the same time than in the raw data, steps in the inverse\nvelocity line are eliminated (thus improving also the degree of\nfitting) and accuracy of T\nf is much higher (ΔT f = 2); the related life\nexpectancies converge close to the actual time to failure line\nalready from late November, 1 month before the event. On the\ncontrary, predicted lines from Fig. 5a, b are horizontal in their first\nsection and ultimately do not get near the actual expectancy line.\nSummarizing, the Mt. Beni case study, as analysed here, showed\nthat linear fitting of unfiltered inverse velocity data, although\nsurely constituting an indicator of the on-going acceleration of\nFig. 1 Photo of the Mt. Beni rockslide ( a) and topographic map displaying the location of distometric bases ( b, from Gigli et al. 2011)\nFig. 2 Inverse velocity analysis for the distometric base 1-2 installed on the Eastern flank of Mt. Beni\nOriginal Paper\nLandslides 14 & (2017)520\nthe slope movements, produced Tf which anticipate by several\ndays the actual time of collapse. Smoothing data with simple\nmoving average algorithms allowed to benefit from improved\nqualities of fitting and of T\nf predictions. In particular, long-term\nmoving average gave optimal results for the noisier, less linear (α\n< 2) time series from distometric base 15-13, while short-term\nmoving average performed better when applied to the more regu-\nlar measurements registered by distometric base 1-2. Exponential\nsmoothing did not produce satisfying improvements to these data.\nVajont landslide\nThe 1963 Vajont disaster in Northeast Italy has been one of the\nmost catastrophic landslides in history, and many authors have\nstudied the event under different perspectives. Without entering\ninto the complex details of the failure mechanism, as these have\nalready been largely described and discussed (and still are), the\ncollapse occurred at about 10:39 p.m. local time on 9 October 1963,\nwhen a 270 million m\n3, mostly calcareous rock mass detached\nfrom the slope of Mt. Toc and slid at 30 m/s into the newly created\nVajont reservoir (Fig. 6). The consequent tsunami wave\novertopped the dam and killed 2500 people in the villages down-\nstream. The pre-failure movements of the unstable material were\nstrongly controlled by the water level in the valley floor and\ncreeping motions began to be observed immediately since the\ncreation of the reservoir (Havaej et al. 2015). The final chain of\nevents started with the April 1963 reservoir filling cycle; the final\nrupture followed 70 days of downslope accelerating movements\n(Helmstetter et al. 2004). According to measurements from four\nbenchmarks installed at different positions on the mountain slope,\npre-failure velocities were extremely high: Among these,\nbenchmarks 5 and 63 in particular were the ones which showed a\nclear state of accelerating creep, with displacement rates ranging\nfrom ≈5 mm/day up to over 20 cm/day (Fig. 7a , b) and a total\ncumulative deformation of a few meters (Muller 1964). In Fig. 7,\nmeasurements from Mt. Beni are also plotted in order to show the\ndifferent orders of magnitude in the displacement between the two\nlandslides (Fig. 7a) and the different shape of the curves (Fig. 7b).\nDistometric base 1-2 of Mt. Beni indeed shows significantly lower\nrates relatively to both Vajont benchmarks. Data from base 15-13\nare instead in the same order of magnitude, but the acceleration is\nBstepped^ rather than exponential. This further indicates the need\nto perform high-degree smoothing on this time series (Fig. 4).\nIn Fig. 7c, the inverse velocity plot for the unfiltered measure-\nments of benchmark 63 is shown. Even though a slight step-like\npattern can be noticed, the graph is remarkably linear as a whole\nand, most importantly, the linear trend line fits particularly well\nthe last points leading up to failure. Therefore, if recorded ve-\nlocities are regularly high since the initial stages of acceleration,\ni.e. A ≈ 0.04 (as in Vajont data; V oight 1988)o rl o w e r ,a n di ft h e\nassumption of α = 2 is consistently satisfied, it is suggested not to\napply any strong data filtering, in order to avoid loss of sensitiv-\nity with regard to actual downward trends. At most, linear fitting\nof short-term averaged velocities may also be conducted in par-\nallel to the fitting procedure of the original data. For benchmark\n63, SMA yields a slightly better fitting and a slightly more accu-\nrate T\nf (ΔTf = 0.3) with respect to results from the original data\n(ΔTf =1 . 1 ,F i g . 7d). Conversely, inverse velocity plot from bench-\nmark 5 (Fig. 8a) seems to have a pattern quite similar to that of\ndistometric base 15-13 at Mt. Beni (Fig. 4a): After the fourth point\nof the dataset, the trend appears to assume a certain concavity\nFig. 3 Life expectancy analysis for the distometric base 1-2 installed on the Eastern flank of Mt. Beni\nLandslides 14 & (2017) 521\n(α < 2) and consequently, as opposed to benchmark 63, the last\nvelocity points before failure are not well fitted by the linear\nregression line. This causes again a premature Tf prediction,\nwhich anticipates also the time of the last measurement on 8\nOctober ( ΔT\nf = 2.7, Fig. 8a). Excellent linearization is produced\nby LMA and ESF (Fig. 8), with the first one also determining an\nFig. 4 Inverse velocity analysis for the distometric base 15-13 installed on the Eastern flank of Mt.

From the relative life expectan-\ncy plot, it can be seen that a correct prediction about the time of\nfailure could have been given about 10 days earlier than the\nactual event; in further support of their reliability, the forecasts\nof the time of failure remained consistent after each of the last six\ndisplacement measurements. On the other hand, life expectan-\nc i e sf r o mt h er a wd a t aa r ea l w a y ss o m ed a y so f ft h ea c t u a lt i m e -\nto-failure line.\nAgain, as in the Mt. Beni case study, it is not argued that\nvelocities from benchmarks at Mt. Toc were not indicating a clear\naccelerating trend towards slope collapse. Nevertheless, it is found\nout that the accuracy of T\nf predictions could be improved by\nappropriately smoothing out data and thus linearize the respective\ninverse velocity plots. Equivalently to distometric base 15-13 at Mt.\nBeni, results showed that, for fast-moving slopes, if α <2 , i t i s\nsuggested to filter data with a long-term moving average; instead,\nFig. 6 The catastrophic Vajont landslide\nFig. 7 Velocity measurements for benchmarks 5 ( a) and 63 ( b) of the Vajont landslide (from Muller 1964) and for distometric bases 1-2 ( a) and 15-13 ( b) at Mt. Beni, for\nreference. Both benchmarks display significantly higher rates than 1-2 distometer. 15-13 distometer is characterized by rates of the same order of magnitude as those at\nVajont, but the increase of velocity occurs through Bsteps^ rather than exponentially suggesting the need to perform a high-degree data smoothing (Fig. 3). c, d Inverse\nvelocity analysis for benchmark 63 installed on Mt. Toc\nLandslides 14 & (2017) 523\nif α ≈ 2, it seems more convenient to proceed with the regular\ninverse velocity analysis performed on an on-going basis or, at\nmost, to filter data with a short-term moving average.\nStromboli debris talus roto-translational slide\nOn 7 August 2014, a debris talus located below the Northeastern\ncrater (NEC) of Stromboli V olcano was affected by a roto-\ntranslation slide, evolving into a rock avalanche on a 30° – 45°\nsteep slope called BSciara del Fuoco ^, and followed by the\nopening of an eruptive vent localized at ≈650 m a.s.l. ( ≈100 m\nbelow the NEC, Di Traglia et al. 2015;R i z z oe ta l .2015;Z a k šek\net al. 2015). Debris cone material likely reached the sea, but\ntsunami waves were not recorded. Growth stages of this debris\ntalus at Stromboli are a common phenomenon related to the\nexplosive activity, which produces accumulation of\nvolcaniclastic debris around th ea c t i v ec r a t e r s( C a l v a r ie ta l .\n2014). Contrariwise, the roto-translational slides occurred at\nthe onset of the 2002 – 2003, 2007 and 2014 flank eruptions,\ncharacterized by magma propagation from the central conduit\ntowards the NEC (Di Traglia et al. 2014, 2015). The debris talus\nis composed by loose volcaniclastic material, prevalently brec-\ncias alternating with tuff, lapillistones and thin (<2 – 3m )l a v a\nflows (Apuani et al. 2005). The NEC area has been continuously\nmonitored by a Ground-Based Interferometric Synthetic Aper-\nture Radar (GBInSAR) system (Di Traglia et al. 2014,F i g .9 ). The\nlatter recorded an increase in the l ine-of-sight displacement rate\nof the debris talus starting from 30 May 2014. The curve of\ndeformation rate for this period presents a high degree of noise\n(Fig. 10a). This is mostly due to the dynamics of the magma\nwithin the volcanic edifice: At Stromboli, successive cycles of\nfilling and emptying of the plumbing system can cause phases\nof inflation and deflation of the entire crater area, thus adding\nnatural noise to the displacements of the debris talus. For this\nreason, strong negative velocities are displayed at times in\nFig. 10a and a definite raise in rates can be observed only from\nlate July. This final acceleration was made up of relatively low-\nmedium rates, from few millimetres per day up to a peak\nvelocity of 40.4 mm/day on 6 August 2014. Since 04:01 GMT\nFig. 8 Inverse velocity and life expectancy analyses for benchmark 5 installed on Mt. Toc\nOriginal Paper\nLandslides 14 & (2017)524\non 7 August 2014, the GBInSAR recorded complete loss in\ncoherence in the debris cone se ctor, consistently with a fast\nmovement of the summit area (i.e. Taf).\nIn Fig. 10a, the OOA is found about only 1 week before the slope\ncollapse. Hence, it was not possible to produce with confidence a\nfailure prediction, as only few measurements could be collected\nbetween OOA and T\naf (Fig. 10b). Data filtering, eliminating short-\nterm fluctuations and highlighting longer-term cycles, is here of\ninvaluable help, as it may allow an earlier detection of the OOA\npoint. With LMA (Fig. 11), the latter is found on 27 July, but the\ninverse velocity line appears to be excessively smoothed out,\ncausing a late T\nf prediction (ΔT f = −1.7); ESF generates the OOA\non 24 July and provides a slightly better failure forecast (ΔT f =\n−1.3), despite a worse fitting (R 2 = 0.77). SMA undoubtedly pro-\nduces, in this case, the best results overall (Fig. 11a, b ): A trend\ntowards the x-axis begins already on 23 July, the level of fitting is\nhigh (R 2 = 0.88) and Tf is extremely reliable (ΔT f = −0.4). In fact,\nfrom the life expectancy plot in Fig. 11b, it can be seen that a\nroughly correct time of failure forecast could have been made\nconsistently since 3 August, approximately 4 days before the actual\ncollapse of the debris talus. Similarly to the time series of\ndistometric base 1-2 at Mt. Beni, it is found that, when accelera-\ntions towards failure are characterized by moderate velocity\nvalues, it is more reliable to filter data by means of SMA. This is\neven more important for the Stromboli case study, where failure is\nusually anticipated by a very brief final acceleration phase and\ntherefore an early identification of the OOA is highly needed. A\nshort-term moving average has higher sensitivity towards trend\nchanges in the data and thus appears to be the most helpful mean\nof analysis, with regard to this specific issue.\nCollapse of the medieval city walls in Volterra\nV olterra is one of the most well-known cultural heritage sites in\nCentral Italy. The town, originated as an Etruscan settlement, later\nbecame an important medieval centre. During this period, the perim-\neter walls, which still surround the town, were built. Some of these\nh a v et h e i rf o u n d a t i o no v e rc e m e n t e ds a n dd e p o s i t s ,w h i c hs i to nt o po f\nthe stratigraphic column and overlap a formation made up of marine\nclays. On 31 January 2014, a 35-m long and 9.5-m high portion of the\nhistoric walls suddenly collapsed. After this event, a GBInSAR system\nwas installed to monitor the deformation of the entire SW side of the\ncity walls (Pratesi et al.2015;F i g .12). Since late February, generally high\ndisplacement rates of another portion of the walls were captured; after\nan initial phase of roughly linear movements (≈ 2m m / d a y ) ,f i n a l l y\nvelocities increased decisively on 1 March (Fig. 13a) and, shortly\nthereafter, the area completely collapsed in the early afternoon of 3\nMarch 2014. Pratesi et al. (2015) attributed the source of the instabilities\nto the accumulation of water above the impermeable clays and to the\nresulting overpressure exerted on the upper incoherent sands. This\nwas confirmed by the fact that high movement rates were registered\nonly at the bottom of the wall, in agreement with a slightly roto-\ntranslational motion caused by loss in base support.\nThe V olterra case study is of particular interest, as it does not\nstrictly imply a failure on a natural slope, but rather on a man-\nmade structure built on unstable terrain. This does not necessarily\nconstitute a limit for INV , as V oight (1989) affirms that the model\nis thought to be applicable to a variety of fields where mechanical\nfailure is involved, including earth sciences, materials science and\nengineering. However, the apparent lack of a linear trend toward\nzero in the inverse velocity plot of the unstable part of the walls\ndiscouraged its use during the terminal phase of the emergency\n(Fig. 13b). Following the recurrence of above-average rate values\n(from ≈2– 3 to 19.4 mm/day), authorities were informed about the\nhigh probability of an imminent collapse, but a T\nf estimation\nprocess was not carried out.\nIt can be argued that accelerations affected by strong deviation\nfrom the ideal inverse velocity linearity are those in more need of\nhigh-degree smoothing. In fact, SMA and ESF (Fig. 13c, d ) do not\ngenerate useful improvements from raw data in terms of readabil-\nity of the inverse velocity plot and again a T\nf prediction would not\nbe advised. Contrariwise, LMA filter provides a clear OOA and an\nobvious linear trend line to the x-axis (R\n2 = 0.98, Fig. 13e). Results\nshow that final Tf is just few hours earlier than Taf (ΔTf = 0.5 days).\nThe relative life expectancy plot indicate that roughly accurate\nforecasts of the time of wall collapse could have been made as\nsoon as 27 February, as all the subsequent points forming the\npredicted time-to-failure line lie in close proximity to the actual\ntime-to-failure line.\nTherefore, if rate values seem to diverge from the expected\nbehaviour of the INV model, it is suggested to try performing\ntime of failure analyses only following the application of\nstrong filters to the data. The usefulness of this process is\neven greater if relatively low movement rates are involved in\nthe acceleration phase and, consequently, little variations in\nvelocity values can give rise to confusing spikes in the inverse\nvelocity plot.\nEffect of noise on the reliability of T\nf predictions\nFrom the analysis of failure case histories, it resulted that data\nsmoothing can provide several types of advantages, depending\non the properties of the velocity curves: When a general trend\ntoward failure is already evident in the raw data (e.g. Mt. Beni,\nVajont), it is still possible to obtain more reliable T\nf predic-\ntions; when measurements have a high level of noise and the\nfinal phase of acceleration is short-lived (e.g. Stromboli debris\ntalus), an earlier OOA can be identified; when data seem to\nimply that linear INV is not applicable (e.g. V olterra), it might\nbe possible to deduce the obscured trend toward failure, if\npresent. Particularly in the last t wo instances, applying filters\ncould be decisive in allowing, in practice, the use of INV .\nAmong the considered examples, it was noticed that measure-\nments at Stromboli and V olterra were affected by high noise\nintensity and strongly needed to be filtered in order to apply\nthe method, while at Mt. Beni and Vajont, the level of distur-\nbance was smaller and affected just the reliability of T\nf\npredictions.\nWith the aim of performing additional analyses, we now\nsimulate the introduction of random sets of noise on two\nideal time series which, initially, are created in accordance\nto V oight ’s model for rates approaching failure. These series\nare calculated based on the equations that better approximate\nthe actual trends of displacements registered at Mt. Beni\n(distometric base 1-2) and Vajont, meaning that the parame-\nters A and α must be estimated accordingly. As reckoned by\nVo i g h t (1988), this can be accomplished by plotting log-veloc-\nity against log-(t\nf–t). Such plot for data from distometric base\nLandslides 14 & (2017) 525\n1-2 at Mt.

Solving for the equation\nof the best-fit line, one obtains A =0 . 1 0 2 a n d α =1 . 9 9 4 , r e -\nmarkably close to the condition of perfect linearity; approxi-\nmating for α = 2 yields A = 0.099.

For displacements\nat Mt. Toc (Vajont), V oight (1988 ) found that rates can be suitably\nFig. 9 Cumulative map of displacements of Stromboli crater area, as measured along the radar line-of-sight between 1 January 2010 and 6 August 2014. Range and cross-\nrange resolution are on average 2 m × 2 m. Map and time series of displacements (Fig. 10a) are obtained by Bstacking^ the interferograms phase using 8-h averaged SAR\nimages, with a measurement accuracy of ±0.5 mm (Antonello et al. 2004; Intrieri et al. 2013; Di Traglia et al. 2014; Di Traglia et al. 2015). Interferometric phase can be\ncorrupted by noise (decorrelation), caused by the contribution of scatterers summing up differently among SAR acquisitions and estimated by a calculation of the\nBcoherence^ between two images (values in the range 0 –1). The displacement time series was measured in the area of the debris talus which showed high coherence\n(>0.9) during the analysed period. In the insert, the location of Stromboli Island is also shown\nFig. 10 Deformation rate ( a) and inverse velocity plot after OOA point ( b) for the GBInSAR time series of the debris talus below the NEC of Stromboli Volcano\nOriginal Paper\nLandslides 14 & (2017)526\nexpressed by v = 27(tf − t)− 1 with A = 0.037 and α = 2. By substitut-\ning in the two equations values of time-to-failure from 60 to 1, we\nsimulate rates of two slopes with similar behaviour to Mt. Beni and\nMt. Toc and in agreement with a condition of perfect linearity in\nthe inverse velocity plot.\nAs previously mentioned, we then add to these series of\nvelocities several sets of random noise, meaning both IN and\nNN. We consider IN as additive noise, while NN as multipli-\ncative noise. The first is in fact related to the precision of the\nmonitoring device, which is typically not dependent on the\namount of movement occurred (we hypothesize an instrumen-\ntal accuracy of ±1 mm). Conversely, natural noise, which is\ndetermined by the factors disrupting the ideal linearity of slope\naccelerations (i.e. variations of A and α), is proportional to the\nstage of failure. This can be easily seen in ( 5): Equivalent\nchanges of A and α will cause bigger differences between\nactual and theoretical velocities as the time-to-failure de-\ncreases. Also, in INV , velocity at failure is considered infinite,\nan assumption which obviously is not verified in nature.\nValues of Bdisturbed^ velocities are thus computed as\nv ¼ v þ Rr þ v⋅Rf\n/C0/C1\n⋅Rr ð6Þ\nwhere Rr is a randomly generated number between [− 1, +1] and Rf\nis a fixed constant which indicate the applied intensity of natural\nnoise. Certainly, (6 ) is a simplification of an otherwise very com-\nplex and unpredictable phenomenon; nonetheless, it can stand as\na quick and generally effective approximation for the purposes of\nthis analysis.\nAccording to this approach, examples of a strong NN compo-\nnent (R\nf = 0.2) added to the series of ideal rates for Mt. Beni and\nMt. Toc (Vajont) are described, and the effects of data smoothing\nin improving the reliability and usability of the inverse velocity\nmethod are thus further evaluated. Mt. Beni (1-2) and Vajont both\nrepresent excellent cases of slope acceleration prior to failure. Mt.\nBeni was characterized by noticeably lower velocities (i.e. higher\nvalue of A) with respect to Mt. Toc. It follows that, when an equal\nnoise intensity is introduced to the respective rate curves, the\nFig. 11 Inverse velocity and life expectancy analyses for the smoothed GBInSAR time series of the debris talus below the NEC of Stromboli Volcano\nLandslides 14 & (2017) 527\neffects on the analysis of inverse velocity plots will be different.\nThis can be easily observed in Figs. 15 and 16. Graphs have been\ndivided in two sections, before and after an identified OOA/TU\npoint. As previously said, this marks either the point after which a\ntrend toward the x-axis can be clearly defined or a change in the\ntrend slope and usually occurs together with a reduction in data\nnoise (Dick et al. 2014).\nSimulation for Mt.

Scatter in the first half of the plot would not\nallow, in a real-time monitoring scenario, to safely determine a\ntrend. This is also confirmed by the low value of R\n2.S M Aa n d\nESF both yield no great improvement in terms of scatter in the\nfirst part of the dataset and the OOA is found basically at the\nsame time than in the original series. Conversely, LMA gener-\nates better smoothing across the entire series and a clear OOA is\nfound already at t =1 4 , w i t h a f i n a l ΔT\nf = 0.5. LMA thus pro-\nduces, in this case, notable benefit to the INV analysis.\nThe Vajont simulation gives different points of interest: The\npresence of an overall trend toward zero remains generally clear\nand T\nf predictions could be initiated quite early in the series\n(Fig. 16a). Probably, a TU or OOA would be safely found at t =1 7\nor thereabout. Similarly to what suggested in the real case history\nFig. 12 a Overview of the Volterra case study: the location of the GB-InSAR system is indicated by the yellow star , whereas the red stars highlight the two collapse\nevents occurred on the medieval walls. b, c Photos of the first and second Volterra city wall collapses of 31 January 2014 and 3 March 2014, respectively\nOriginal Paper\nLandslides 14 & (2017)528\nof benchmark 63, LMA smooths out excessively the inverse veloc-\nity line and, consequently, a sensibly negative ΔTf is found (− 2.5).\nBoth LMA and ESF have TU/OOA at t = 14. Instead, SMA produces\na reliable Tf (ΔTf = 0.6) and the earliest OOA at t =1 1 .\nSeveral other simulations, with different sets of randomly generated\nvalues of noise, were performed. Although the random nature of the\nprocess can sometimes yield slightly different results with respect to\nthe ones presented here, the same general behaviour was observed.\nFig. 13 Displacement rate ( a), inverse velocity analysis ( b–e) and life expectancy analysis ( f) relatively to the second collapse event of the Volterra city walls. The time\nseries in ( a) was extracted from the radar pixel which showed the highest coherence as well as the highest displacements during the analysed period (Pratesi et al. 2015).\nIn b–d, plots do not provide clear linear trends; therefore, failure predictions cannot be made with acceptable confidence\nFig. 14 a Log velocity vs log-( tf-t) for distometric base 1-2 at Mt. Beni and ( b) comparison between actual and fitted data\nLandslides 14 & (2017) 529\nDiscussion: proposing standard procedures for inverse velocity analyses\nINV can be a powerful tool for estimating the time of geomechanical\nfailure. Based on the results displayed in the previous sections, it is also\nclear that the reliability and the applicability of the method can be\ndecisively improved by appropriately treating data. General guidelines\nfor ideal data filtering of velocity data could be suggested, specifically:\nFig. 15 Example of random noise added to the inverse velocity plot of the fitted data for distometric base 1-2 (Mt. Beni)\nFig. 16 Example of random noise added to the inverse velocity plot of the fitted data for Mt. Toc (Vajont)\nOriginal Paper\nLandslides 14 & (2017)530\n& If movement rates are consistently high (i.e. A ≈ 0.4 or lower),\nit is not advised to perform data smoothing, as it would\ngenerally yield no real improvements to the INV analysis and\ncause less sensitivity to actual trend changes. Only SMA could\nprovide some benefits in terms of both OOA/TU identification\nand reliability of T\nf. In general, focus should be put mostly on\nupdating Tf predictions on an on-going basis and on searching\nfor new TU points in the data.\n& If movement rates are low (i.e. A ≈ 0.1 or higher) and/or\nnoise has significant intensity, data smoothing is of great\nimportance in order to perform INV analyses and, some-\ntimes, could make the difference between being able to make\neffective T\nf forecasts or not (e.g. distometric base 15-13 at Mt.\nBeni, Stromboli debris talus and V olterra). IN mainly influ-\nences the initial stage of the acceleration, significantly\ndelaying the identification of OOA/TU points. At the same\ntime, NN may also disturb the linearity of the last stages of\nacceleration and thus hamper the accuracy of T\nf predictions.\nDepending on the properties of the rate curve and on the\nparticular behaviour of the slope, it was observed that dif-\nferent filters could give better results in different case stud-\nies. Therefore, T\nf predictions should be made while applying\nboth short- and long-term filters and simultaneously study-\ning the related trend lines. Exponential smoothing could\nalso be run in parallel for comparison.\nIt should be noticed that studying trends of displacement\nrate remains in great part exposed to a high degree of subjec-\ntivity. In INV, much of the analysis is not executed following\npre-defined procedures but is r ather based on the personal\ninterpretation and experience of the user. Dick et al. ( 2013,\n2014) indeed explained that there is no fixed rule for identifying\nthe OOA and TU points, while Rose and Hungr (2007 )r e c o m -\nmended that best-fits should be constantly re-evaluated in light\nof possible trend changes and of qualitative observations in the\nfield. As shown in the case histories presented here and as\nhinted also by Dick et al. ( 2014), different techniques for data\nsmoothing may be alternatively more suitable, depending on the\nspecific characteristics of the velocity curves, on the properties\nof the monitoring device and on the requirements of the emer-\ngency plan. On top of that, it is obvious that the linear extrap-\nolation of inverse velocity data trending toward the x-axis\nshould not be considered as a precise forecast of the time of\nfailure, but rather as a general estimation only.\nWe thus propose the introduction of some standard proce-\ndures for the analysis of inverse velocity plots; once established,\nthese may be performed automatically and with little input from\nthe user. We think that this would provide benefits especially\nwhen dealing simultaneously with multiple series of measure-\nments, as in the case of point cloud data (e.g. ground-based\nradar), total station prisms, etc. These procedures concern the\nidentification of OOA and TU points and the setup of two\ndifferent alarm levels, which would support the definition of\nthe emergency plans. Like in mining operations, exceeding the\nthresholds between adjacent alarm levels could instantly prompt\npre-determined actions of evacuation and/or slope remediation\n(Read and Stacey 2009).\nFirst alarm threshold: onset of acceleration\nWe consider the occurrence of an OOA as the first alarm thresh-\nold. Such event, which indicates the beginning of a progressive\nstage of failure (Zavodni and Broadbent 1980), would trigger the\ninitiation of inverse velocity analyses, meaning that linear fitting\nmay be applied only to velocity data from OOA onwards. Best-fits\nshould be constantly revised to make sure that they successfully\ndescribe the most recent acquisitions. Predictions should also be\nupdated on an on-going basis each time a new measurement is\navailable and until failure occurs or, otherwise, an End Of Accel-\neration (EOA) point is detected (i.e. regressive stage of failure); an\nEOA signals the return to the condition of safety. As previously\ndemonstrated, identifying the OOA does not depend only on the\nuser’s interpretation but also on the degree of smoothing with\nwhich data are treated. In the case of moving averages, using a\nlong time period in the calculations highlights longer-term trends\nbut can introduce more lag to data; on the other hand, shorter\ntime periods generate higher responsiveness to slight trend chang-\nes, which in turn may just represent minor fluctuations.\nIn time series analysis, a crossover between a shorter-term and\na longer-term average is typically one of the most basic signals\nsuggesting the occurrence of a trend change in the raw data (Olson\n2004; Shambora and Rossiter 2007). A crossover is defined as the\npoint where a short-term moving average (c-SMA) line crosses\nthrough a long-term one (c-LMA). Here, we consider that, if the c-\nSMA crosses above the c-LMA (B positive crossover ^), the begin-\nning of an uptrend and hence the occurrence of an OOA is\nsignalled, while the opposite indicates the beginning of a down-\ntrend (B negative crossover ^) and the occurrence of an EOA. The\norders of the short-term and long-term moving averages should be\npreviously selected and can vary depending on the intensity of\ndata noise; typically, in the context of moving average crossover\nanalyses, the c-SMA is set so that it already smooths out signifi-\ncantly most of the slighter fluctuations, while the c-LMA is calcu-\nlated over three or four times the c-SMA time period. The concept\nof c-SMA/c-LMA for the crossover analysis is therefore not neces-\nsarily related to the aforementioned use of SMA/LMA for improv-\ning time of failure predictions, since a higher degree of smoothing\nmust usually be used in order to avoid false crossover points\nbetween the moving averages. This may cause to establish different\ntypes of c-SMA and of c-LMA for different case studies, depending\non the properties and the noise of the rate curves.\nThe technique has been applied to the Stromboli debris talus\nand Mt. Beni movement series; those two only, among the exam-\nined case histories, have in fact enough points in the dataset in\norder to find a c-LMA. As already discussed several times, the\nGBInSAR series from Stromboli has a high degree of noise; there-\nfore, a moving average calculated over seven measurements\n(which is equivalent to the LMA in Sections Methodology and\nResults) was arbitrarily selected as the c-SMA. A moving average\ncalculated over 21 measurements was consequently picked up as\nthe c-LMA. The first positive crossover is found on 8 July (Fig. 16a)\nbut is then followed by a negative crossover, which determines an\nEOA and the termination of the failure forecasts. A new positive\ncrossover is detected on 18 July and leads up to the debris talus\ncollapse on 7 August. Remarkably, the OOA is established even\nearlier than what had been done through visual examination of the\ndata (Figs. 10 and 11) .T h eo t h e re x a m p l ei sr e l a t i v et ot h e\nLandslides 14 & (2017) 531\ndistometric base 1-2 at Mt. Beni (Fig. 17). The rate curve is in\nextreme accordance with the linear inverse velocity model (Fig. 14);\nhence, no substantial smoothing is required for the crossover\nanalysis. A MA(3) and a MA(9) were selected as the c-SMA and\nc-LMA, respectively. The only positive crossover is found on 12\nAugust and is not revoked until the slope collapse on 28 Decem-\nber, more than 4 months later. The OOA is detected roughly at the\nsame time than through manual identification (Fig. 2).\nSome key benefits may thus derivefrom the application of this type\nof approach. During the monitoring activity, an indication that a\ncertain target has experienced a positive crossover (i.e. exceeded the\nfirst alarm threshold) could be iss ued automatically. In this way, the\nnecessity to perform a subjective OOA analysis of the different rate\ncurves would be avoided. This would be of great importance especially\nin radar applications, which can theoretically provide the user with\nthousands of time series of movement to evaluate at the same time. In\nterms of risk assessment on a slope, o bserving the spatial distribution\nof these alarms could allow to readily estimate the size of the instability\nand thus determine if the detected onset of an acceleration phase is the\nexpression of a local movement or instead the signal of an incoming\npartial/total failure event.\nSecond alarm threshold: failure time window\nExtrapolation of the linear best-fit line to infinite velocity surely\ncannot be considered as an exact prediction of the time of failure.\nT\nf is influenced by the assumptions and simplifications implied in\nthe INV model and also by the degree of data smoothing applied.\nIn previous sections, it was shown how the performances of\ndifferent filters can vary, depending on the properties of the rate\ncurve; however, selecting the most appropriate smoothed time\nseries can usually be done safely only in retrospect, during the\npost-event evaluation of the displacements which led up to failure.\nTherefore, the presence of a trend in the inverse velocity plot must\nbe considered just as an indication that failure is presumably going\nto occur in proximity of its point of intersection with the x-axis.\nWe propose a quick and reproducible procedure to define the\ntime interval during which the occurrence of a failure event is\nconsidered highly probable (B failure window^ , T\nfw). The failure\nwindow is obtained by projecting simultaneously the best-fits of\nboth a SMA and LMA. This will yield two diverse T\nf, with the\ndifference between Tf(LMA) and Tf(SMA) being indicated as Δ; here,\nassuming Tf(SMA) < Tf(LMA), Tfw was determined between:\nT fS M AðÞ − Δ\n2 ; T fL M AðÞ þ Δ\n2\n/C20/C21\nThe former corresponds to the period of activation of the\nsecond alarm level, i.e. the second alarm threshold is exceeded at\ntime T ¼ T fS M AðÞ −Δ/C14\n2. Understandably, there is no exact rule as to\nhow use Δ for establishing the Tfw limits. These should be appro-\npriately set based on the preferences of the user, on how well data\nseem to accommodate the INV in terms of noise and linearity and,\nmost importantly, on the level of acceptable risk for the monitored\ncase study. T\nfw must be wide enough to account for the uncertainty\nimplied with the failure predictions, while on the other hand,\nexcessive precaution might trigger too early activations of the\nsecond alarm threshold; the nature of the elements at risk and\nthe characteristics of the emergency scenario should be carefully\nevaluated in order to assess the appropriate width of the failure\nwindow. Relatively to the case studies presented in this paper, the\naforementioned T\nfw limits were evaluated as the most suitable for\nsuccessfully including Taf and not providing a too conservative\nalarm threshold (Fig. 18). The Stromboli debris talus and Mt. Beni\n(distometric base 1-2) slope failures are again used for reference to\nprovide an overview of the methodology: Failure windows have\nbeen calculated on the third last measurement of the rate curves\n(respectively 3 and 26 days before failure), in order to test the\nprocedure to data of both high- and low-temporal resolution. For\nStromboli (Fig. 18a), on 4 August, the second alarm threshold is\nplaced in the early morning of 6 August and T\nfw lasts until 9\nAugust, successfully including Taf with a convenient safety margin.\nThe width of the failure window is about 3½ days. For Mt. Beni\n(Fig. 18b), the prediction performed on 2 December determines a\nwider failure window, spanning from late 23 December 2002 to\nearly 2 January 2003 (≈ 10 days). T\naf lies in the middle between\nTf(SMA) and Tf(LMA) and thus also in the centre of the Tfw interval.\nSimilar results, based on the application of the same procedure on\nboth Vajont (benchmark 5) and V olterra monitoring data, are also\nshown in Fig. 18c, d .\nThe failure window must be continuously updated each time a\nnew measurement is available, and consequently, new T\nf(SMA) and\nTf(LMA) predictions are performed. With this approach, it would be\npossible to recognize with a certain advance when the second\nalarm level will approximately be triggered and thus when the\nrelated emergency response actions will have to be taken. The\neventual consistency over time of the T\nfw boundaries can be\nconsidered as a strong element of support that failure will actually\noccur within the identified time frame. Lower Δ values suggest that\nmeasurements (and thus the forecasts) can be considered reliable,\nwhile higher Δ values indicate that the downward trend in the\ninverse velocity plot is less clear, determining an increased width\nof the failure window and more uncertainty surrounding T\naf. The\nvalue of Δ and the accuracy of the method in general is also\ninfluenced by the number and frequency of measurements\navailable.\nIt is again intended that this simple and practical approach,\nonce established within the monitoring program, could be extend-\ned to all the rate curves available and serve as a standard and\nautomatic procedure to setup in real time the alarm level of each\nmeasuring point. Like for the moving average crossover approach,\nthis may result of great advantage especially when simultaneously\ndealing with multiple targets (e.g. point cloud data). By estimating\nin advance when and on which points the second alarm threshold\nwill be exceeded, more time would be provided to evaluate the risk\nin terms of size and probability of failure and promptly implement\nthe pre-determined evacuation and/or remediation strategies.\nConclusions\nThe inverse velocity method is a powerful tool for predicting the\ntime of geomechanical failure of slopes and materials displaying\naccelerating trends of movement. Because of the simplicity of use,\nits linear form ( α = 2) is arguably the most common mean of\nanalysis of displacement data for this type of emergency scenarios.\nThe assumed linear trend of inverse velocity toward infinite must\nbe considered as an approximate estimation of the time of failure,\nand its reliability is heavily dependent on the degree of\nOriginal Paper\nLandslides 14 & (2017)532\ninstrumental and natural data noise. Noise can also decisively\ndelay the identification of the onset of acceleration and trend\nupdate points. Smoothing measurements of deformation rate is\nthus a crucial process of INV analyses and possibly must rely on\nquick and easily applicable algorithms. In this study, two moving\naverages and an exponential smoothing function have been tested\nin order to filter velocities acquired at three large slope failures\nand one city wall collapse case histories. In general, moving aver-\nages seemed to provide better fitting than exponential smoothing.\nIt also resulted that filters have different performances depending\non the shape of the inverse velocity curve and on the intensity of\ndeformation rates. Following these findings, some general guide-\nlines to suitably perform data smoothing were thus deduced.\nBecause it may not be possible to safely carry out this interpreta-\ntion process until the late stages of acceleration or even thereafter,\nsome standard procedures for the setup of failure alarm levels\nwere defined by employing both short- and long-term moving\naverages. The first alarm threshold identifies the OOA and is\nestablished following the implementation of the moving average\ncrossover rule. The second alarm threshold corresponds to the\ntime of activation of the failure window, which is calculated based\non the forecasts of both SMA and LMA. The failure window\nFig. 17 Crossover analysis for Stromboli debris talus ( a) and Mt. Beni ( b) displacement rates\nFig. 18 Examples of failure window analysis for Stromboli debris talus ( a), Mt. Beni ( b), Vajont ( c) and Volterra ( d) inverse velocity plots\nLandslides 14 & (2017) 533\ndefines the time frame during which the occurrence of the collapse\nevent is considered most probable. The user would be able to\nanticipate when the thresholds will presumably be exceeded and,\ntherefore, when the pre-determined response actions may have to\nbe taken. Equally importantly, if several measuring targets are\nincluded within the dataset (e.g. point cloud data), major benefit\nwould derive from the ability to simultaneously and automatically\nassess the alarm level of each point. The analysis of the spatial\ndistribution of the alarms would determine a prompt estimation of\nthe size of the instability and of the probability of an imminent\nfailure.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits un-\nrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provid-\ned you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source,\nprovide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if\nchanges were made.\nReferences\nAntonello G, Casagli N, Farina P, Leva D, Nico G, Sieber AJ, Tarchi D (2004) Ground-based\nSAR interferometry for monitoring mass movements.
