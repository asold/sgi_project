    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to synthesizing mind-sets using artificial intelligence, LLMs (large language models).The paper focuses on a general treatment of food trends and food fads.The approach presented here shows how artificial intelligence can become the source of information, a synthesizer of mind-sets in the spirit of Mind Genomics and end up being a reporter writing press releases after projecting what will happen in years to come.The approach presented here represents a new way to understand a topic and is meant for educational purposes where a student or a professional must come up to speed quickly on a topic and even think of what might be next.",
