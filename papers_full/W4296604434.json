Session data can be associated\nwith item metadata, allowing SBRSs to capture item dependencies\nat the attribute level within the session. However, most of the exist-\ning SBRSs take the IDs of users and items as the main input source\nto learn session contexts and produce next item recommendations\n[13, 14, 40]. Recent hybrid models demonstrated improved perfor-\nmance when combining item embeddings and their attributes to be\nused as additional side information [5, 10, 27, 31, 32, 32, 38].\nHowever, there are two major issues that these recommenda-\ntion models face. The first issue is that they cannot scale with the\ngigantic sizes of industrial datasets. For instance, The Home De-\npot (THD) industrial dataset used in this paper has approximately\n40 million sessions and 0.6 million items. Since the dataset is cre-\nated by sampling several months of online sessions, the actual\nfull dataset (e.g., a year-long one) will be even much bigger. Most\nSBRSs [5, 8, 13, 14, 19, 40, 41, 44] that utilize a large item-ID em-\nbedding matrix can suffer from slow training or memory shortage\nproblems.\nThe second issue arises due to cold-start items and sparse ses-\nsions, i.e., sessions that contain new or unpopular items. SBRSs will\nhave limited or no ability to generate good representations for such\nitems since they have no-to-few interactions. Moreover, many exist-\ning models are incapable of scoring and recommending new items\nunseen during training [25, 35]. Even combining metadata informa-\ntion with item-IDs, i.e., item embeddings, to learn compound item\nrepresentation results in only a slight performance improvement\ncompared to using item-ID only [5, 10, 16, 27, 31, 33, 38]. This can\nbe attributed to the model overfitting item-ID as the main feature.\nTo tackle the above issues, we propose M2TRec, a Metadata-\naware Multi-task Transformer model (Figure 1). M2TRec is com-\npletely item-ID free (i.e., no item-ID embeddings) and uses only item\nattributes such as title, category, brand, color, and other metadata to\nlearn item representations. Since M2TRec does not require creating\nand learning a large item-ID embedding matrix, it can be easily\napplied to large industrial datasets. In addition, new items will still\nhave accurate representations using their metadata attributes, and\narXiv:2209.11824v1  [cs.IR]  23 Sep 2022\nRecSys ’22, September 18–23, 2022, Seattle, WA, USA Shalaby et al.\nFigure 1: M2TRec Architecture. (left) M2TRec first encodes metadata of each item in a session into embeddings and feeds the\nconcatenation of those metadata embeddings to a Transformer encoder. A current session encoding is obtained via average-\npooling of the item encodings from Transformer, and the session encoding is used for next item and next category predictions.\n(right) Detailed architecture illustration of a Transformer encoder used in M2TRec.\ntheir similarity with previously-observed items can be captured\neven if they have no or few interactions with users, making it\nsuitable even in highly dynamic deployment settings where the\nitem catalog changes frequently. Finally, recent research has shown\nthat multi-task learning (MTL) results in increased performance\nand generalizability of the model [6, 7]. Thus, given the focus on\nleveraging item metadata, we design M2TRec as a multi-task SBRS\ntrained not only to predict the next item but also its category and\nsubcategories to enhance the prediction accuracy of an individual\ntask.\nVia thorough experiments, we demonstrate the superior perfor-\nmance of the proposed model on real-world datasets. Our multi-task\ntraining allows faster convergence, higher accuracy with fewer it-\nerations, and robust performance with fewer training data (some\nexperimental results are omitted due to space limits). Our scalable\narchitecture serves both item and category recommendations in\none model with higher prediction performance than baselines in\nboth tasks.\n2 RELATED WORK\nNeural networks have served as the main architecture of exist-\ning SBRSs. Earlier works [ 8–10] utilize a recurrent neural net-\nwork (RNN) to model sequential dependencies of items within\na session. Recently, attention-based approaches [13, 14, 19, 23, 37]\nand graph neural network (GNN)-based methods [39–42, 44] have\nbeen proposed to enhance the longer and deeper dependencies for\nSBRSs. Furthermore, Transformer [ 34]-based SBRSs [ 2, 4, 5, 18]\nshow the state-of-the-art prediction performance due to its pow-\nerful and efficient self-attention mechanism. Multi-task learning\n(MTL) [11, 16, 20] has been also adopted for SBRSs to enhance the\nnext item prediction via generalization. However, the above models\nhave shortcomings that they (1) are susceptible to cold-start items\nor sessions, (2) cannot predict the categories of the next item in a\nsession, or (3) are not scalable to the real-world billion-scale rec-\nommendation setting since they have to store item-IDs and their\nembeddings, which are this paper is solving.\nMethodologies are developed to incorporate item metadata into\nSBRSs for modeling user/item dependencies [5, 10, 12, 16, 21, 27, 28,\n31, 33, 38, 43]. However, the vast majority of such methodologies\nhave at least one of the following two shortcomings. The first short-\ncoming is that cold-start items and/or users are removed during the\npre-processing of datasets used for evaluations of proposed mod-\nels [5, 12, 21, 28, 43]. Item metadata alone cannot give the model the\nability to recommend such cold-start items [17]. The model needs\nto have a separate mechanism for using items’ content informa-\ntion and representation to recommend cold-start items. Tagliabue\net al. [30] propose a pipeline to learn accurate cold-start item repre-\nsentations with small changes to an existing model infrastructure.\nHowever, a separate neural model needs to be trained to obtain the\ncold-start embeddings, which limits the scalability of the solution.\nRaziperchikolaei et al. [22] and Zheng et al . [45] suggest hybrid\nand metadata-aware recommendation models to predict implicit\nfeedback for cold-start items of users, respectively. However, those\nmodels are not designed for the session-based recommendation set-\nting. The second shortcoming of such methodologies is that they do\nnot make use of item titles or descriptions as attribute features for\ncapturing product similarities [12, 16, 21, 27, 33, 38]. In such cases,\nitem-IDs are used as inputs to represent different products. Such\nrepresentation is unable to incorporate any relevant information\nabout cold-start items as opposed to using title encodings.\n3 METHODOLOGY\nNext Item Prediction: We denote a user sessionS= [𝐼1,𝐼2,𝐼3,...,𝐼 𝑛]\nas a sequence of items a user interacted within that session. Each\nitem 𝐼𝑘 = {𝐴𝑘,1,𝐴𝑘,2,𝐴𝑘,3,...,𝐴 𝑘,𝑚}is described by a set of 𝑚at-\ntributes which could be context-specific or item-specific. In this\nwork, we consider item-specific attributes only (e.g., title, descrip-\ntion, category). Each attribute 𝐴could be either textual, categorical,\nor numerical. In the setting of session-based recommendations, we\nare given a session S, and our objective is to maximize the predic-\ntion probability of the next item the user is most likely to interact\nwith given all previous items in S. Formally, the probability of the\ntarget item 𝐼𝑛 can be formulated as:\n𝑝(𝐼𝑛|S[𝐼<𝑛];𝜃) (1)\nwhere 𝜃 denotes the model parameters and S[𝐼<𝑛]denotes the\nsequence of items prior to the target item𝐼𝑛. As in previous works [9,\nM2TRec: Metadata-aware Multi-task Transformer for Session-based Recommendations RecSys ’22, September 18–23, 2022, Seattle, WA, USA\nTable 1: Statistics of datasets used in the experiments.\nDataset Diginetica THD\n# of training and test sessions 191K, 16K 39M, 1.5M\n# of items 119K 575K\nMetadata / Attributes Product title, Category\nProduct title, Categories (L1, L2, L3, Leaf),\nManufacturer, Brand, Department Name,\nClass Name, Color\nPrediction tasks Item-ID, Category Item-ID, Categories (L1, L2, L3, Leaf)\n13, 14, 40], we generate dense next item sub-sequences from each\nsession Sfor training and testing. Therefore, a session Swith\n𝑛 items will be broken down into 𝑛 −1 sub-sequences such as\n{([𝐼1],𝐼2),..., ([𝐼1,𝐼2,...,𝐼 𝑛−1],𝐼𝑛)}, where ([X], Y) means X as the\ninput sequence of items and Y as the target next item.\nItem Metadata Encoding: Item metadata can be numerical, cate-\ngorical, or unstructured such as title, description, and image. We pro-\npose a unified method for representing all item attributes. The objec-\ntive is to map every attribute 𝐴into a real-valued vector 𝑣𝐴 ∈R𝑑𝐴.\nNumerical attributes 𝑟 are represented as a single-valued vector\n𝑣𝑟 ∈R. Categorical attributes 𝐶 ∈{𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐 𝑠}are encoded into\nvectors 𝑣𝐶 using an embedding layer dedicated to each attribute,\ni.e.,\n𝑣𝐶 = 𝑐𝑖𝜃(𝐶) ∈R𝑑𝐶 (2)\nwhere 𝑐𝑖 is the one-hot encoded value of 𝐶, 𝜃(𝐶) ∈R𝑠×𝑑𝐶 are\nthe weights of the category embedding matrix, 𝑠 is the number of\npossible values of 𝐶, and 𝑑𝐶 is the dimensionality of 𝐶’s vector.\nTextual attributes𝑇 are first tokenized using a subword tokenizer\n[26] to obtain individual tokens [w1,w2,..., w𝑡]and then encoded\ninto vectors 𝑣𝑇. A simple and efficient encoding strategy is to create\na dedicated embedding layer for 𝑇 to map each token w into a\nvector and then aggregate the token vectors using mean or max\npooling, i.e.,\n𝑣𝑇 = Pool𝑡\n𝑖=1(𝑤𝑖𝜃(𝑇))∈ R𝑑𝑇 (3)\nwhere 𝑤𝑖 is the one-hot encoded value of token w𝑖, 𝜃(𝑇) ∈R𝑘×𝑑𝑇\nare the weights of the token embedding matrix,𝑘is vocabulary size\nof 𝑇, and 𝑑𝑇 is the dimensionality of 𝑇’s vector. Further enhance-\nments to textual attributes encoding can be achieved by sharing\nthe encoding parameters across all textual attributes that have\nsimilar vocabularies such as item title, description, category, color,\netc. Although the weight-sharing scheme is expected to reduce the\ntraining time, it may increase the overall model size. This is because\nthe vector size would be the same for all the attributes that share\nthe same encoder regardless of their vocabulary size. This will lead\nto high memory and storage requirements when deploying the\nmodel in production. Alternatively, in this work, we use a separate\nembedding layer for each textual attribute as in Eq. (3) and choose\nits vector size proportional to the attribute’s vocabulary size.\nSession Encoding: After encoding all metadata features for an\nitem 𝐼𝑘 at position 𝑘 in the input session 𝑆, we concatenate all the\nfeature vectors to create a compound vector representation 𝑣𝐼𝑘 for\n𝐼𝑘, i.e.,\n𝑣𝐼𝑘 = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(𝑣𝐴1,𝑣𝐴2,...,𝑣 𝐴𝑚)∈ R𝑑𝐼 (4)\nwhere 𝑑𝐼 is the summation of the lengths of all feature vectors. Note\nthat item-IDs are not used to create the compound representation\n𝑣𝐼𝑘 in Equation (4). We then use the compound representations of\nitems in 𝑆 as input to the session encoder in a pre-fusion fashion\nto learn a session encoding 𝑣𝑆. First, Transformer encoder [ 34]\ngenerates contextual encodings for each session item 𝑣𝐼𝑘, followed\nby an average-pooling layer to generate the session encoding 𝑣𝑆,\ni.e.,\n𝑣𝑆 = Pool𝑛−1\n𝑘=1 (Trans-Enc(𝑣𝐼𝑘;𝜃(𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑆)))∈ R𝑑𝑆 (5)\nwhere 𝜃(𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑆)is the model parameters of the Transformer encoder\ntrained with sessions 𝑆.\nMulti-task Learning: M2TRec incorporates multi-task learning\n(MTL) to boost the performance of next item prediction. MTL has\nproven to be an effective mechanism to reduce the risk of over-\nfitting, learn more generalized shared representations for all the\ntasks, and improve the overall performance on each task by sharing\nthe knowledge acquired from other related tasks [24]. The target\nspace of next item prediction (i.e., all item-IDs) is much larger than\nthe space of other item attributes such as all categories or brands.\nTherefore, the task of next item category or brand prediction should\nbe easier to learn than next item prediction. Moreover, learning\nsuch auxiliary tasks would benefit the task of next item predic-\ntion since it biases the metadata encoding and the Transformer\nencoder layers to learn representations that are close not only to\nnext item, but also to other similar items belonging to the same\ncategory or brand, thus, narrowing down the space of possible next\nitem candidates to a much smaller set of items. To this end, we\ntrain M2TRec to predict next item attributes (e.g., item categories)\nas auxiliary tasks to the task of next item-ID prediction. For each\ntask, including next item-ID prediction, we create a prediction head\ncomposed of Fully Connected Layer (FCN) followed by Softmax\nfunction to generate the probability distribution over all candidates\nfor the corresponding task, i.e.,\nˆ𝑦𝑘 = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 (FCN𝑘(𝑣𝑆;𝜃(𝑘)))∈ R𝑑𝑘 (6)\nwhere 𝜃(𝑘)is the parameters of the FCN for the 𝑘th task, and 𝑑𝑘\nis the total number of possible outputs of the 𝑘th task (e.g., total\nnumber of categories for category predictions).\nThe loss of the 𝑘th task prediction head and overall prediction\nof M2TRec are calculated using cross-entropy loss as follows, re-\nspectively:\nL𝑘 = −\ndk∑︁\n𝑖=1\n𝑦𝑘𝑖 ·log ˆ𝑦𝑘𝑖, L=\nN∑︁\n𝑘=1\nL𝑘 (7)\nwhere 𝑦𝑘 is a one-hot encoding including the ground-truth infor-\nmation for the 𝑘th task.\n4 EXPERIMENTS\nDatasets: We conducted our experiments on two real-world datasets.\nWe exclude all sessions with only one item. Table 1 shows dataset\nstatistics along with the item metadata we used and the prediction\ntasks for each dataset.\nRecSys ’22, September 18–23, 2022, Seattle, WA, USA Shalaby et al.\nTable 2: The performance of M2TRec on next item prediction task on all sessions (All) and sessions with tail items (Sparse)\ncompared to other baseline methods.

Similar to SIGIR 2021 data chal-\nlenge dataset[29], training data is created by sampling sev-\neral months of online purchase sessions.

On THD dataset, the relative performance\nimprovements are in the range of 5% ∼8%. As in [27], we compute\nthe relative performance improvement of a metric as the difference\nin the performance of M2TRec and the second runner over the\nperformance of the second runner on that metric reported in per-\ncentage. These improvements indicate the effectiveness of utilizing\nitem metadata and the multi-task learning regime which are unique\nto M2TRec, compared to other baselines which use only item-ID as\nthe main and only input for session-based recommendations.\nNext item prediction task on sparse sessions: Table 2 high-\nlights the performance of all the models on sparse sessions contain-\ning cold-start or tail items in the two datasets. Tail items indicate\nitems with less than 10 occurrences in a dataset. These sessions\nrepresent 34% and 12% of the total sessions in Diginetica and THD\ndatasets respectively. As we can notice, M2TRec relative improve-\nments on sparse sessions are much higher than all the other models,\nespecially on HIT@20 and Recall@20 for both datasets (e.g., 11% ∼\n23% boost on both datasets). These results demonstrate the effec-\ntiveness of our proposed item-ID free approach on sparse sessions\nand its robustness in mapping tail and cold-start items within these\nsessions into meaningful representations based on their metadata.\nPredicting next item’s category: One of the main objectives of\nthis research is to develop a scalable architecture that serves both\nitem and category recommendations in one model using an effi-\ncient MTL regime. We found significant performance gains when\njointly training our model to predict next item and its categories\nat different levels of the catalog taxonomy (see ablation study be-\nlow). We demonstrate the efficacy of training our SBRS to predict\nnext category over deriving it from session items by comparing the\ncategory prediction performance against two heuristics: (1) Per-\nsonalized top-N Frequent:This simple heuristic uses past session\nitems’ categories and recommends the most frequent ones, and (2)\nTop-N Predicted:This simple strategy works by first predicting\ntop-N next items from a metadata-aware single task model called\nMeTRec (see ablation study below), and then uses their categories\nas recommendations such that the category of the top-ranked next\nitem will be ranked first and so on.\nFigure 2 shows the performance of category recommendation\nusing M2TRec against the two heuristics. Performance is measured\nin terms of HIT@20 and reported for L1, L2, L3, and leaf categories\nof THD dataset. As we can notice, the performance of M2TRec is\nsignificantly better than the two other strategies across all tasks.\nFor example, on leaf category prediction, the performance gains are\nin the range of 3%∼45%. These results demonstrate that M2TRec\ncan effectively perform next category prediction tasks.\nM2TRec: Metadata-aware Multi-task Transformer for Session-based Recommendations RecSys ’22, September 18–23, 2022, Seattle, WA, USA\nFigure 2: M2TRec Performance on Category Recommendation\nTable 3: The performance of M2TRec on all sessions (All) and sessions with tail items (Sparse) compared to variants of M2TRec.\nDataset Diginetica THD\nMethod HIT@20 Recall@20 MRR@20 HIT@20 Recall@20 MRR@20 Model\nSizeAll Sparse All Sparse All Sparse All Sparse All Sparse All Sparse\nTRec𝑖𝑑 30.24 16.93 46.96 29.45 8.55 4.35 32.90 11.58 39.40 15.22 15.31 4.90 110.3M\nMuTRec𝑖𝑑 32.69 21.10 50.13 35.18 9.50 5.71 33.73 13.93 40.35 17.92 15.43 5.90 111.1M\nTRec𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑒 32.17 20.41 49.40 34.64 8.70 5.22 32.29 16.48 38.64 21.19 14.25 6.32 56.1M\nMeTRec 34.78 24.99 52.50 40.43 9.33 6.22 33.54 17.10 40.04 21.97 15.17 6.42 86.5M\nM2TRec 35.47 25.51 53.70 41.01 9.75 6.63 34.78 19.05 41.51 24.86 15.65 7.38 89.5M\nAblation Study of M2TRec: To investigate the contribution of\neach component of M2TRec, we developed the following variants:\n(1) TRec𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑒 : A variant of M2TRec which uses item title as the only\ninput feature without any additional meta-data. It leverages the\nsame architecture in Figure 1, but has one prediction head only to\npredict next item-ID, (2) MeTRec: Metadata-aware variant which\nutilizes all metadata as input features. This variant also has one\nprediction head to predict next item-ID, (3) TRec𝑖𝑑: A variant of\nM2TRec which uses item-IDs as the only input feature without any\nadditional meta-data attributes. It leverages the same architecture\nin Figure 1 but has only one prediction head to predict next item-\nID, and (4) MuTRec𝑖𝑑: Multi-task variant of TRec𝑖𝑑. The model is\ntrained on the same tasks as M2TRec, but uses only item-IDs as the\ninput features (i.e., it does not use other metadata features).\nThe performance of M2TRec and its variants on all and sparse\nsessions is shown in Table 3, where model size indicates the num-\nber of model parameters. M2TRec outperforms all other variants\nsignificantly, especially on sparse sessions where the performance\ngains on Diginetica dataset are in the range of 1% ∼9% in terms\nof HIT@20 and 1%∼12% in terms of Recall@20. On THD dataset,\nperformance gains are in the range of 2%∼7% and 3%∼10% in terms\nof HIT@20 and Recall@20 respectively. As we include all metadata\nin MeTRec, the performance on sparse sessions outpaces all other\nvariants. Moreover, the performance on all sessions improves signif-\nicantly and outpaces TRec𝑖𝑑 and its multi-task version (MuTRec𝑖𝑑)\non Diginetica, while it is on par with MuTRec𝑖𝑑 on THD dataset.\nThis demonstrates the usefulness of metadata-awareness and its\nsufficiency in providing competitive performance to classical item-\nID based SBRSs. As we can notice, M2Trec and MeTRec are about\n19%-22% less in size than the item-ID based variants. Besides, all\nthe metadata-aware variants are more scalable to the increase in\nitem catalog size compared to the item-ID based variants.\n5 CONCLUSION\nThis work provides a scalable and practical solution for leveraging\nmetadata to learn from cold-start items in the recommendation\nprocess. The key is using an item-ID free approach for recommen-\ndations. By using a metadata-based representation of items, the\nM2TRec model learns the representation for items with zero or few\ninteractions. Through experiments on two datasets, we show that\nM2TRec outperforms several state-of-the-art session-based recom-\nmendation models. Multi-task learning contributes to the model’s\npredictive performance. Importantly, M2TRec’s core ideas help in\ngenerating fast and accurate recommendations for cold start-items,\nsessions with tail items, and for the task of category prediction.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Abien Fred Agarap. 2018.
