  "abstract": "A damping device is developed, which allows reducing peak stresses occurring during cutting and providing improved reliability of ceramic tools. The use of a device with a damping element made of steel C45 characterised by hardness lower than the material being machined results in the reduction and stabilisation of peak stresses during cutting-in of ceramic and carbide tools in the machining area. It is demonstrated that damping of peak stresses and vibration processes arising at cutting-in of a ceramic and carbide tool and cutting of hardened steels of enhanced hardness is an effective way to improve the reliability of ceramic and carbide tools due to the reduction of the probability of failure. The specifics of the parameters of the performance of finishing hardened steels with ceramic and carbide tools with the proposed nano-structured multi-layered coatings was studied under the conditions of damping, which showed the improvement of the functional parameters of cutting. The formation of modifying coatings on a cutting ceramic and carbide tool in machining hardened steels with HRC 50 and more under the conditions of damping can reduce the coefficient of variation of tool failure to 0.3, which improves the ability to predict the failure of ceramic and carbide tools and allows recommending ceramic tools for use in automated production.",
