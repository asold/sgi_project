In insects, multiple genetic mechanisms have been identified\nfor sex determination [1–5]. The oriental fruit fly,Bactrocera dorsalis(Hendel) is classified in\nthe B. dorsalis complex, which is a group of tropical fruit flies contains 75 morphologically sim-\nilar taxa [6]. Recently,B. dorsalis was demonstrated to be the senior synonym ofB. papaya\nDrew and Hancock andB. invaden Drew, Tsuruta and White, but notB. carambolae [7]. B.\ndorsalis is one of the most destructive pests throughout Southeast Asia and a number of the Pa-\ncific Islands and is considered to be one of the most important pest species in world agriculture\nby some entomologists [6–7]. The distribution ofB. dorsalis includes much of the tropical and\nsubtropical regions and extends into warm temperate areas such as southern Mediterranean\nEurope [8]. As a result of its widespread distribution, invasive ability and potential impact on\nmarket access,B. dorsalis is considered to be a major threat to many countries fruit industries.\nIn order to control the population of this species and other economically important agricultural\npests, an effective, biologically-based control system has been developed, termed the sterile in-\nsect technique (SIT) [9]. For most SIT targets, large scale sex separation is considered highly\ndesirable or essential for the release of only males [10–11]. Thus, a comprehensive understand-\ning of sexual differentiation in theB. dorsalis species offers an opportunity to promote the de-\nvelopment of novel sexing strategies and genetic control techniques to fight this pest.\nAlthough the primary signal and subordinate genes for sex determination inB. dorsalis are\ncurrently unknown, the genetic cascade regulating sexual development has been well character-\nized inDrosophila [12]. Sex determination starts with the primary signal, which then regulates\na cascade of genes and ends with transcription of the conserveddoublesex (dsx) gene that con-\ntrols sexual differentiation. The diverse mechanisms for sex determination mainly result from\nthe presence of complicated primary signals. InDrosophila melanogaster, the primary signal is\nthe ratio between X chromosomes and autosomal chromosomes. When the ratio is 1.0 (XX:\nAA), the sex determination master geneSex lethal(sxl) is active; while the ratio is 0.5 (X: AA),\nsxl remains inactive. A previous study suggests that the primary signal is the X-linked signal el-\nements (XSEs) which function to activate thesxl gene in females [\n13]. As a genetic switch,sxl is\nonly turned on in females and promotes female somatic sexual development via its auto-regu-\nlation [14]. The protein made by thesxl transcript directs female-specific splicing of the down-\nstream genetra, resulting in the production of functional Tra protein only in females [15]. The\nTra protein, together with the product of the genetra-2, activates female-specific splicing of\ndoublesex (dsx), generating one female-specific Dsx protein [16]. In contrast, whensxl is inac-\ntive, a non-functional, truncated Tra peptide is produced, resulting from the male-specific\nsplicing oftra. Thus, when the interaction between Tra and Tra-2 is absent, one male-specific\nDsx protein is generated from the default splicing ofdsx pre-mRNA. Both male and female\nspecific Dsx proteins are functional but control sexual dimorphism in opposite ways [14, 16].\nIn tephritid fruit flies, the primary signal that controls this pathway is theDominant Male De-\nterminer (M). Thesxl ortholog in tephritids is not sex-specifically expressed and appears to play\nno role in sex determination. AlthoughM hasn’t been characterized,tra and tra-2 have been\nidentified in several species, includingCeratitis capitata[17–18], Musca domestica[19–20], Bac-\ntrocera oleae[21], Lucilia cuprina[22]a n dAnastrepha species [23–25]. In these species, tran-\nsient, embryonic knock-down oftra led to XX males, suggesting thattra initiates an auto-\nregulatory mechanism in early embryos, in contrast toDrosophila. In addition, evidence that\ntra-2 is required to establish and maintain female somatic sexual development was first reported\nin M. domestica [19], then inC.\ncapitata [18]a n dA. suspensa [25], but not inBactrocera species.\nIn these species, injection oftra-2 dsRNA in XX female embryos led to phenotypic male\nRoles oftransformer and transformer 2in Sex Determination\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0128892 June 9, 2015 2/1 5\nProgram in 2013 with China Scholarship Council and\nGerman Academic Exchange Service. FHW,\npreparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\ndevelopment. As released sterile females do not contribute to sterility in the field population and\ncan cause losses by female stinging or female transmitting disease, a several-fold advantage has\nbeen found in male-only release program [10–11]. The ability to reverse XX females to pheno-\ntypic males is highly advantageous to biological control programs such as SIT programs that\nbase on male-only release, as well as the development of transgenic sexing strategies based on fe-\nmale-specific lethality [26–28] and transgenic autocidal strategies where released males transfer\nconditional lethal genes to their progeny [29–30]. In medfly, transgenic RNAitransformer has\nalready proven to be effective in heat shock induced production of male-only progeny. It is con-\nsidered to be a promising strategy for the development of novel sexing strains [31].\nIn B. dorsalis, sequence analysis of thedsx homolog reveals the presence of four putative\nTra/Tra-2 binding sites located at female-specific exon 4 [32]. The four conserved 13 nucleo-\ntide repeat elements suggest that the Dsx protein inB. dorsalis retains the conserved essential\nrole as a double switch regulator in sexual development. In order to obtain a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the roles oftra and tra-2 in sex determination and fertility inB. dorsalis, the\ngenomic and cDNA structure ofBdtra and Bdtra-2 genes were isolated and analyzed. The sex-\nspecific splicing ofBdtra was assessed using RT-PCR. Embryonic RNAi was employed to deter-\nmine the effects ofBdtra and Bdtra-2 on sex determination and fertility. The results of this\nstudy advance our capability to generate male-only progeny with the ability to mate by a mo-\nlecular approach, leading to an important advance toward improving SIT inB. dorsalis.\nMethods and Materials\nRearing ofB. dorsalis\nThe oriental fruit flies used in this work were generated in an inbred wild-type colony. Flies\nwere reared at 27°C with 75–80% relative humidity, under a cycle of 14/10 h light/dark, and fed\nan artificial diet consisting of 1g cane sugar and 8g yeast extract. Newly laid eggs were collected\nand transferred onto the surface of larval medium consisting of 2.5 g agar, 4 g sodium benzoate,\n2.86 g nipagin, 4 g tissues, 35 g brewer’s yeast, 95 g corn meal and 4 ml concentrated HCl in a 1\nliter diet. Larvae burrowed into the food and emerged again when ready to pupate. Before pu-\npation, they were transferred into small plastic boxes with sand. Pupae were kept at 27°C until\nadults emerged.\nIsolation ofBdtra and Bdtra-2\nTo isolateBdtra and Bdtra-2, total RNA was extracted from male and female adults using TRI-\nzol Reagent (Invitrogen). For each sex, three cDNA pools were generated: 1) the first strand of\ncDNA was synthesized using 2μg total RNA, oligo-dT primer and Quant reverse transcriptase\nbased on instructions from the manual of the FastQuant RT Kit (with gDNase, TianGen); 2)\n5’-RACE cDNA; and 3) 3’-RACE cDNA using the BD SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification\nKit (BD Biosciences). First,Bdtra and Bdtra-2 cDNAs were isolated using RT-PCRs on adult\nmale and female cDNA pool 1 template with primers 260+/1329- and AF2/AR1 at an anneal-\ning temperature of 50°C and 60°C, respectively. These primers were designed on the base of\ncDNA sequences fromB. oleae by aligning Tra and Tra-2 protein sequences fromC. capitata\n(GenBank: AF434936; EU999754),B. oleae (GenBank: AJ715413; AJ547623), andA. suspensa\n(GenBank: JN597286; JN597290), respectively (S1 and S2 Figs). Second, RACE PCRs were per-\nformed on cDNA pool 2 and 3 to obtain 5’UTR and 3’UTR for each sex, following the manual\ninstructions. Primers 286+/1043+ and 514-/286- were used to isolate 3’UTR and 5’UTR of\nBdtra by nested PCR, respectively. ForBdtra-2, primers 354+ and 228- were used. Third, geno-\nmic DNA was extracted using TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (TianGen). Introns were ampli-\nfied using PCRs on genomic DNA with primers 3+/299-, 225+/706- and 655+/1285- at 60°C\nRoles oftransformer and transformer 2in Sex Determination\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0128892 June 9, 2015 3/1 5\nfor annealing. ForBdtra-2, primers 9+/366- and 358+/1185- were used with an annealing tem-\nperature of 60°C. All the PCR products were purified and cloned into T vector following the\nmanual of the pEASY-T1 Cloning Kit (TransGen). The positive recombinants were cultured\nand sequenced subsequently.\nSequence analyses\nSequence alignment and similarity analyses were performed using the NCBI website. Multiple\nsequence alignments of Tra and Tra-2 protein sequence were analyzed with the online Clus-\ntalW2 software (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/). Phylogenic trees of Tra and Tra-\n2 were reconstructed using the neighbor-joining tree-building method. The reliability of the re-\nsulting topologies was tested by the bootstrap method. Phylogenetic trees were rooted using\nthe tra or tra-2 gene of Hymenoptera. Exons and introns ofBdtra-2 were identified by aligning\nsequences using the Spidey program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/spidey/).\nExpression patterns ofBdtra and Bdtra-2\nTo analyze the expression patterns ofBdtra and Bdtra-2, cDNA templates were prepared from\ntotal RNA extracted from different developmental stages and tissues. The specimens of eggs,\nlarvae and pupae were collected from mixed sexes and carefully staged. Tissues from adults\nwere dissected in DEPC-treated PBS buffer. All the specimens were homogenized immediately\nin liquid nitrogen. The total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and 2μg\nqualified total RNA of each speciesmen was used to synthesized the first trand cDNA following\nthe manual of the FastQuant RT Kit (with gDNase, TianGen). RT-PCR was performed to ana-\nlyze the sex-specific patterns ofBdtra using primers 225+/706- and ms43+/706- both at an an-\nnealing temperature of 60°C. ForBdtra-2, primers 9+/1185- were used at a 60°C annealing\ntemperature. RT-PCR product of the reference genea-tubulin (a-tub) using primersa-tub +/\na-tub— was used as a control.\nRNAi knock-down ofBdtra and Bdtra-2\nFor double-stranded RNA synthesis, two fragments ofBdtra were amplified with primers 79\n+/576- and 613+/1205- from female cDNA and oneBdtra-2 fragment with primers 422+/732-.\nAn EGFP control fragment was isolated with primers 27+/688- on the vector 1201 containing\nEGFP [33]. A T7 binding site for the T7 RNA polymerase was introduced into these primers.\nDsRNAs were generated using the Ambion Megascript T7 Kit and then purified with Ambion\nMEGAclear following the manual instructions. Function analyses were performed by microin-\njection of dsRNA into embryos as described by Handler and James [34]. Embryos were collect-\ned half an hour after the eggs were laid, dechorionated and microinjected with 2 mg/ml dsRNA\nsolution. Approximately 400–500 embryos were injected for each treatment.\nFertility test\nAdults that developed from eggs injected withEGFP, Bdtra and Bdtra-2 dsRNAs were counted\nand examined for their sexual morphological traits. Males were reared and used to test fertility\nunder standard laboratory condition. For each RNAi treatment, 35 cages containing all intersex\nindividuals were set up on day 6 after the adults emerged. One RNAi male was backcrossed to\ntwo virgin wild-type females in each cage. Mating was observed every 30 min during the dark\nphotoperiod, and eggs from each cage were collected continuously for 5 days. The newly\nhatched larvae were then transferred onto host fruit until the adults emerged. After the fertility\ntest, the RNAi males from each cage were dissected in DEPC-treated 1×PBS buffer for analysis\nRoles oftransformer and transformer 2in Sex Determination\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0128892 June 9, 2015 4/1 5\nof their internal genital structures. The residual bodies without gonads of all the XX-reversed\nmales, intersex individuals, and a portion of the XY males without gonads were collected and\nhomogenized immediately in liquid nitrogen for total RNA extraction. The first strand cDNA\nwas synthesized using 2μg of total RNA and reverse transcribed using the FastQuant RT Kit\n(TianGen). RT-PCR was performed to analyze the splicing pattern oftra and dsx from RNAi\nmales. The specific primers 225+/706- were used to amplifyBdtra. To amplifyBddsx, non-sex-\nspecific primer 1074+, female-specific primer f1072- and male-specific primer m2015- were\nmixed to use. Both RT-PCRs were at a 60°C annealing temperature.\nAll the primers used in this study were listed inS1 Table.\nImaging\nThe images of the flies of each RNAi phenotype were taken using a Keyence VHX-2000\nMicroscope.\nResults\nIsolation ofBdtra and Bdtra-2\nBdtra was isolated in three steps. First, PCRs were performed on adult male and female cDNA\nusing primers designed on the basis of the conserved amino acid motifs in thetra homologs of\nB. oleae, C. capitata and A. suspensa. Second, 5’- and 3’- RACE PCRs were performed on\nRACE cDNA pools to obtain full-length cDNA sequences. Third, introns were identified by\nPCRs on genomic DNA using exon-specific primers. One female-specific transcript (1729 bp\ncontaining an open reading frame of 1269 bp) (GenBank: KP342058) and two male-specific\ntranscripts (2083 bp and 2412 bp) (GenBank: KP342060 and KP342059) were found. These\ntranscripts were identified as homologs oftra gene based on similarities to other species includ-\ning B. oleae, A. obliqua and C. capitata using BlastX alignment. Due to the sex-specific splicing\nof Bdtra pre-mRNA, female transcript produces fully functional Tra protein of 422 amino\nacids, whereas male transcripts produce non-functional truncated Tra peptides due to the pres-\nence of several in-frame stop codons. The presence of Tra/Tra-2 binding sites, intronic splicing\nsilencer sequence (ISS) and RBP1 binding sites has been reported in several insect species [17,\n23, 25]. On the basis of sequence similarity, we searched for these sites in the differentially\nspliced intron ofBdtra. Eight Tra/Tra-2 binding sites, four RBP1 binding sites and five ISS sites\nwere found (Fig1A and 1C; S3 Fig). The presence of these sites suggests the possibility of auto-\nregulation ofBdtra splicing as observed inC. capitata [17].\nA ClustalW multiple sequence alignment was performed based on the amino acid sequences\nof dipteran Tra. The alignment showed that Bdtra was more similar to Tra from other tephritid\nspecies than toDrosophid Tra (S1 Fig). Bdtra is 81.32% identical toB. oleae Tra, 54.15% identi-\ncal toC. capitata Tra, 50.35% identical toA. suspensa Tra, but only 16.08% identical toD. mela-\nnogaster Tra. Indeed,D. melanogaster Tra is only 197 amino acids, much shorter than Bdtra.\nThe Neighbour-joining tree of dipteran Tra showed that the species of Tephritidae,Bactrocera\nand\nCeratitis clustered into one subgroup of the same branch, whileAnastrepha clustered into\na different subgroup of that same branch. The Tra proteins of tephritids are more closely relat-\ned toMusca and Lucilia Tra than toDrosophila Tra (S5A Fig).\nBdtra-2 was isolated with a similar method as forBdtra. Bdtra-2 was a transcript of 1332 bp\nin length (GenBank: KP342061) containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 756 bp, which en-\ncoded a putative protein of 251 amino acids with 96.02% identity toB. oleae Tra-2 and 90.08%\nidentity toC. capitataTra-2. Both males and females had only one transcript.Bdtra-2 belongs to\nthe Ser-Arg rich (SR) protein family and has a RNA recognition motif (RRM) flanked by two Ar-\nginine/Serine-rich domain (RS) as shown inS2 Fig. The RRM region and two ribonucleoprotein\nRoles oftransformer and transformer 2in Sex Determination\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0128892 June 9, 2015 5/1 5\nidentifier sequences (RNPs) are highly conserved. BdTra-2 protein is similar to Tra-2 protein\nfrom other tephritids, such asC. capitata, A. suspensa and B. oleae, as well as to the one from\nother dipterans such asM. domestica and L. cuprina, but shows substantial divergence with Tra-\n2 fromD. melanogaster. The Neighbour-joining tree of dipteran Tra-2 showed that theApis and\nNasonia clustered in a basal clade,Drosophila species in another clade and the other dipteran\nspecies in the third clade. Within the latter,Musca was in one branch and the other dipteran spe-\ncies in another.Lucilia clustered in one subgroup and the species of Tephritidae in another.\nAmong the tephritids,Ceratitis and Anastrepha clustered into a subgroup of the same branch,\nBactrocera clustered into a different subgroup of that same branch (S5B Fig).\nFig 1.

Further analyses of theBdtra-2 sequence\nindicate the presence of six putative intronic splicing silencer sequences (ISS) and thirteen puta-\ntive RBP1 sites (Fig 1B; S4 Fig), which have been described as splicing activators or suppressors\nthrough binding with other RNA sequences [35]. These results suggest that the Bdtra-2 protein\nmight be involved in female somatic sexual development through interaction withBdtra.\nExpression patterns ofBdtra and Bdtra-2\nTo analyze the expression patterns ofBdtra, RT-PCR was performed using primers 225+/706-\nto amplify different sized male and female forms ofBdtra. ForBdtra-2, primers 9+/1185- cov-\nered the whole ORF. RT-PCR was performed from mixed sex embryos, larvae, pupae and also\nadult females and males. A female product, a band of 482 bp, was readily detected, whereas a\nmale product, a band of 836 bp was faint, although the embryos were presumably an equal mix\nof males and females (Fig 2A). Since the male form ofBdtra was difficult to detect when the fe-\nmale form was at significantly higher levels than the male form, the expression patterns were\nexamined a second time using RT-PCR with male-specific primer ms43+ and the non-sex-spe-\ncific primer 706- to amplify the male form ofBdtra in embryos. Male product was readily de-\ntected using male-specific primer ms43+ and the non-sex-specific primer 706-. A male\nproduct band of 514 bp was first detected in mixed sex embryos collected 1 to 2 h after the eggs\nwere laid and in all later staged embryos (Fig 2C). In addition, only the female form ofBdtra\nwas detected in female adults and their tissues, such as ovaries, midguts and fat bodies. The\nmale form ofBdtrawas also only detected in male adults and their tissues, such as testes, mid-\nguts and fat bodies (Fig 2B). ForBdtra-2, a single band of the expected size (1201 bp) was am-\nplified in all samples (Fig2A and 2B).\nRNAi knock-down ofBdtra and Bdtra-2\nTo characterize the function ofBdtra and Bdtra-2 in sex determination, RNAi was employed\nto knock-down these two genes. Three dsRNAs (dsBdtra_79, dsBdtra_613 and dsBdtra-2_422)\nwere injected into the posterior end of newly laid eggs. InB. dorsalis adults, males can be differ-\nentiated from females by external genitalia and a row of 22–28 bristles on each lower side of\nthe third tergum (Fig 3A). In contrast, intersex individuals are sexual mosaics, with male exter-\nnal genitalia and a female dorsal view without bristle (Fig 3B). As shown inTable 1, besides a\nfew of intersex individuals, more than 90% males developed from embryos injected with\ndsBdtra_79, dsBdtra_613 and dsBdtra-2_422, respectively. Since the sex ratio of adults that de-\nveloped from uninjected and dsEGFP injected embryos was nearly 1.0 (S1 File), our results\nFig 2. Expression patterns ofBdtra and Bdtra-2.

The intersex phenotype was probably due to partial transformation of the in-\njected female embryos from incomplete knock-down oftra or tra-2. Notably, one XY male\nderived from the dsBdtra_79 injection showed an excessive row of bristles on the lower right\nside of the second tergum (Fig 3E).

These results demonstrate that bothBdtra and Bdtra-2 are indispens-\nable for female somatic sexual development inB. dorsalis.\nFertility test of RNAi males\nTo investigate the fertility, RNAi-generated males were backcrossed to virgin wild type females\nin separate cages for each dsRNA treatment. As shown inTable 2, for uninjected and dsEGFP-\ninjected groups, 100% and 94.3% of the cages contained bisexual progeny at a ratio of nearly\n1.0 (S1 File). While in the cages that contained males which developed from embryos injected\nwith dsBdtra_79, dsBdtra_613, dsBdtra-2_422, nearly 80% of the RNAi males mated and the\nmated females laid eggs, but only 42.9%, 48.6 and 40% of the RNAi males could produce proge-\nny in each treatment (Table 2). Among the RNAi males with progeny, a little more than 20% of\nthe RNAi males could only produce female progeny (Table 2). These males were considered to\nbe XX-reversed males. In addition, all of the intersex individuals could not produce progeny\ndue to a lack of females laying eggs or eggs failing to hatch.\nIn order to investigate the effects ofBdtra-2 and Bdtra on Bdtra and their downstream tar-\nget geneBddsx, the transcript levels ofBdtra and Bddsx were investigated in XX-reversed males\nand intersex individuals. As shown inFig 4, both male and female forms ofBdtra were detected\nin both XX-reversed males and intersex individuals (Fig4A, 4C and 4E). The bands of female-\nspecific Bdtra in intersex individuals were stronger than that of male-specificBdtra. ForBddsx,\nmale-specific Bddsx transcripts were detected, whereas female-specificBddsx transcripts were\nundetected or produced a very faint band in the XX-reversed males.

XX-reversed males and intersex individuals had no ovaries, but testes of a similar\nstructure were observed. In contrast to testes of XY males (Fig 5A), XX-reversed males and in-\ntersex individuals showed aberrant gonads, such as a well-developed testis plus a poorly devel-\noped testis (Fig 5B), hypertrophic testes (Fig5C and 5F), underdeveloped testes (Fig 5D)o r\nonly one testis (Fig 5E). After dissecting the testes, motile sperm were observed in all cases.\nDiscussion\nIn this work, the isolation, expression and function ofB. dorsalis traand tra-2 genes were re-\nported. The genomic structure ofBdtra and Bdtra-2 are very similar to that ofC. capitata [17–\n18] andA.suspensa [25]. Bdtra has sex-specific transcripts: one female-specific transcript,\nwhich encodes a functional Tra protein of 422 amino acids in length, and two male-specific\ntranscripts with in-frame stop codons, which leads to the production of non-functional, trun-\ncated Tra protein. In contrast,Bdtra-2 has a non-sex-specific transcript which leads to the pro-\nduction of Tra-2 protein that is 251 amino acids in length. The BdTra-2 protein shows classic\nFig 5.

Similar results were obtained for dsBdtra and dsBdtra-2 injections. Scale bars are all the same and indicate 0.2mm.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0128892.g005\nRoles oftransformer and transformer 2in Sex Determination\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0128892 June 9, 2015 10 / 15\nfeatures of RNA-binding proteins, with a conserved RRM domain and the presence of ISS and\nRBP1 sites. Tra protein seems to lack an RNA binding domain, and its effects on splicing regu-\nlation require interactions with other proteins containing RNA-binding domains, such as Tra-\n2[ 36]. In the tephritids, housefly and calliphoridstra genes, at least one Tra/Tra-2 binding site\nwas found in the male-specific exon that is downstream of the first protein coding exon [17, 20,\n37]. This suggests that binding of Tra/Tra-2 to the male-specific exon plays an important role\nin splice site selection oftra in females. InBdtra, two Tra/Tra-2 binding sites were found in the\nfirst male-specific exon. Tra/Tra-2 binding sites were also found inBddsx [32]. These results\nsuggest that the Tra/Tra-2 complex inB. dorsalis, similar to that inD. melanogaster and C.\ncapitata, regulates the alternative splicing oftra and dsx by specifically interacting with their\npre-mRNAs.\nIn medfly, housefly andL. cuprina, female forms oftra are maternally transcribed for the\npresence of female forms oftra in very early precellular embryos of mixed sex, whereas male\nform oftra starts the transcription at different developmental stage in different species, such as\nembryos of 4 and 5 h after egg laying in the medfly and the first instar larvae stage inL. cuprina\n[17, 20, 22, 38]. In addition, in medfly, male and femaletra transcripts were found in both\nmale and female embryos between 4 to 8 h after the eggs were laid; by 9 h after the eggs were\nlaid, only the sex-specific transcripts were found, which suggested that the postulatedM-factor\nacts by inhibiting the Tra protein activity [38]. In the oriental fruit fly, the female form ofBdtra\nwas detected in newly emerged adult ovaries and embryos of 0–0.5 h after egg laying, which\nsuggested that the female form ofBdtra was maternally inherited in the embryos as the flies\nabove. The maletra transcript of the oriental fruit fly was detected from 1–2 h embryos on-\nward, much earlier than that of the medfly andL. cuprina.\nIn contrast toBdtra, Bdtra-2 produces a non-sex-specific splicing pattern, a single band was\ndetected in both sexes at all the developmental stages and in different adult tissues analyzed. It\nis the same as that inM\n. domestica [19], C. capitata [18] andAnastrepha fruit flies [24], but dif-\nfers inD. melanogaster as twotra-2 transcripts are detected in male and female, two othertra-2\ntranscripts are present only in male germ cells, due to alternative splicing and transcription\nstart sites [39–40]. Among these transcripts, one of them is transcribed at a high level in the\ngerm line and is indispensable to male fertility [41]. Thus, the function oftra-2 on male fertility\nmight be lost inB. dorsalis.\nFurther characterization ofBdtra and Bdtra-2 was performed by transient knock-down\ntheir transcripts using dsRNA. Nearly 500 eggs were injected in each treatment. Knock-down\nof Bdtra or Bdtra-2 by the injection of dsBdtra_79, dsBdtra_613 or dsBdtra-2_422 effectively\nled to sex reversion of XX females to phenotypic males. In particular, the injection of\ndsBdtra_613 resulted in 95.8% males (XY and XX males) and three intersex individuals (4.2%).\nMoreover, male-specific transcripts ofBdtra and Bddsx were detected in XX-reversed males\nand intersex individuals. Upon dissection, both XX reversed males and intersex individuals\nhave no clear female gonadal morphology but the testes similar structure. The fertility test of\nRNAi males including the intersex individuals showed that the XX-reversed males could mate\nand produce only female progeny, whereas no progeny was produced from the intersex indi-\nviduals in spite of the presence of motile sperm. These results suggest that the level of masculin-\nization might affect fertility. In addition, eggs from almost half of the cages failed to hatch. This\nmay be attributed to incomplete knock-down ofBdtra and Bdtra-2 for the infertile mating of\nXX-reversed males or their roles in other embryonic developmental events inB. dorsalis as the\nsimilar results also occurred when knock-down oftra-2 during the early embryonic stage ofA.\nmellifera resulted in the death of embryos after approximately 70 h of development [42] and\nparental RNAi oftra-2 in Tribolium castaneumled to hatching failure of a few eggs [43]. The\nmechanism of the function oftra and tra-2 in embryonic development is unknown at this\nRoles oftransformer and transformer 2in Sex Determination\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0128892 June 9, 2015 11 / 15\ntime. However, inT. castaneum, the role oftra-2 during embryonic development was consid-\nered to be related to regulation of Tra/Tra-2 target genes coding for proteins such as those in-\nvolved in the formation of the dosage compensation complex [43].\nThe isolation ofBdtra will facilitate the development of a transgenic sexing system. InC.\ncapitata, a differential splicing intron oftra was introduced in a construct to transfer female-\nspecific splicing to a bacterial toxin gene, leading to the development of a female-specific lethal\nstrain [26]. In addition, tetracycline-suppressible transgenic embryonic sexing systems were\ndeveloped forA. suspensa [27] andC. capitata [28]. In this study, the sex reversion induced by\neither Bdtra or Bdtra-2 in B. dorsalis was highly efficient. These XX-reversed males could mate\nwith wild type females, which is a prerequisite for competition in future SIT programs. These\nfindings suggest that it may be possible and promising to develop heritableBdtra or Bdtra-2\ndeficient strains through a transgene-based RNAi strategy for the production of male-only\nstrains. The successfully tested male-only strain could then be irradiated to render all progeny\nsterile. Alternatively, fertile male flies carrying a conditional female transformation system\ncould be used for a RIDL program. Indeed, modeling [44] suggests such a strategy could be\nvery efficient system for population suppression, which would be advantageous when dealing\nwith a species such asB. dorsalis that can be present in high densities in fruit-growing regions.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Fig. Alignment of Tra proteins of insect species from Diptera.Identical and similar\namino acids are shown in black and gray shade.
