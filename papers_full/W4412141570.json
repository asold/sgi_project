SDM is the \nprocess in which healthcare providers, while presenting different clinical options and detailed \ninformation on their outcomes based on medical evidence, incorporate the patient’s values \nand decision-making preferences, encouraging the patient’s involvement in the medical \ndecision-making process and actively listening to their perspective ( 2). However, studies \nindicate that more than 31.6% of healthcare providers have yet to engage in the SDM processes \nOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY\nDeepanjali Vishwakarma,  \nUniversity of Limerick, Ireland\nREVIEWED BY\nShinichi Matsuda,  \nChugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan\nWeiqi Jiao,  \nBoston Strategic Partners Inc., United States\n*CORRESPONDENCE\nYufang Hao  \n bucmnursing@163.com\n†These authors have contributed equally to \nthis work and share first authorship\nRECEIVED 03 April 2025\nACCEPTED 02 July 2025\nPUBLISHED 10 July 2025\nCITATION\nLi X, Chen S, Meng M, Wang Z, Jiang H and \nHao Y (2025) Research progress and \nimplications of the application of large \nlanguage model in shared decision-making in \nChina’s healthcare field.\nFront.

The main barriers include a significant \nknowledge gap between physicians and patients, traditional physician-\npatient communication paradigms that lead most patients to passively \naccept medical advice rather than actively participate in decision \nmaking, and the lack of standardized decision support tools (4, 5). \nAdditionally, systemic factors such as strained medical resources and \nhealthcare reimbursement mechanisms further constrain healthcare \nproviders’ enthusiasm for implementing SDM (6, 7).\nIn recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence \n(AI) technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has \nintroduced new possibilities for addressing these challenges. LLMs are \nartificial intelligence models specifically engineered for \ncomprehending and generating natural language. Typically built on \ndeep learning architectures like Transformer ( 8) and trained on \nmassive text data. They exhibit remarkable language processing \ncapabilities, representing a specific category of AI technology \ndedicated to natural language processing (NLP).\nLLMs equipped with NLP technology can provide an \ninformational foundation for SDM by virtue of their powerful text \nextraction and integration capabilities. Beata F . et al. developed the \nExECT program using NLP to extract key epilepsy-related \ninformation—including diagnosis, seizure type, and seizure \nfrequency—from 200 outpatient clinic letters. The results \ndemonstrated high performance metrics for each information \ncategory, with overall precision, recall, and F1 score of 91, 81%, and \n86%, respectively (9), validating the superior information processing \ncapabilities of NLP . One of the fundamental characteristic of SDM is \nthe bidirectional sharing of information (10). Due to the knowledge \ngap, professional medical knowledge may be incomprehensible from \nthe patient’s perspective. LLMs can bridge this gap by providing \naccurate and easy-to-understand information, thereby holding great \npotential in strengthening healthcare communication (11). Research \nevaluating the ability of LLMs to generate patient education materials \nfound that Google Gemini achieved a readability score of 68.7, \nindicating that LLM-generated educational materials are readable and \nunderstandable for most patients (12).\nForeign scholars have focused on the application of AI in \ndecision-making since 2017 ( 13). Giorgino et  al. explored the \npotential of ChatGPT in orthopedic practice, finding that ChatGPT \ncould facilitate communication with orthopedic patients, assist in \nclinical decision-making, and improve patient communication and \neducation ( 14). Lawson McLean et  al. assessed the potential of \nLLMs in SDM from a neuro-oncology perspective, suggesting that \nthe appropriate integration of LLMs could enhance patient \nengagement and improve the physician-patient relationship ( 15). \nThese researches have primarily focused on the effectiveness of \nLLMs in decision-making, summarizing the possibilities of these \ntechnologies in SDM. The MERGE (Merge Evidence-based Research \nand artificial intelliGence to support smart dEcision) working group \nin China reviewed the current application status from the \nperspectives of AI development, testing, and implementation in the \nSDM field, discussing the potential challenges of AI-assisted \ndecision support ( 16). However, this study focuses more on \ndiscussions at the theoretical level of the entire AI technology, and \nlacks analysis targeting the practical application directions and \nfuture development of LLMs. Based on the above analysis, although \nexisting research has revealed the value of LLMs in clinical decision-\nmaking and some SDM scenarios, there is a lack of in-depth \ndiscussion regarding their practical applications, adaptability within \nthe Chinese healthcare system, and future development directions, \nparticularly the application research within China’s healthcare \nsystem remains scarce.\nTherefore, this study focuses on the application of LLMs in SDM \npractices, reviewing the current implementation status, identifying \nchallenges and suggesting improvements within the context of \nChinese healthcare system, with the aim of providing theoretical \nguidance and practical support for the scientific advancement of SDM \nin China.\n2 Methodology\nThis study employed a narrative review methodology with a \nmulti-database search strategy covering major academic databases in \nboth Chinese and English. The Chinese databases included China \nNational Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang Database, \nwhile the English databases comprised PubMed, Web of Science Core \nCollection, and Scopus. The search timeframe was established from \nJanuary 1, 2014, to December 31, 2024.\nThe Chinese search strategy utilized the following combination: \n(“大型语言模型” OR “大语言模型” OR “LLM” OR “ChatGPT” OR \n“GPT” OR “人工智能”) AND (“共同决策” OR “医患共同决策” OR \n“共享决策” OR “医疗决策” OR “临床决策”). The English search \nstrategy was: (“Large Language Model*” OR “LLM*” OR “ChatGPT” \nOR “GPT-4” OR “Generative AI” OR “Natural Language Processing”) \nAND (“Shared Decision Making” OR “SDM” OR “Clinical Decision \nMaking” OR “Medical Decision Making” OR “Patient Decision \nSupport”). The search strategy underwent preliminary optimization \nthrough pilot searches and was validated by library information \nspecialists prior to formal implementation.\nThe inclusion criteria encompassed: (1) Study types: peer-\nreviewed original research, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, case \nstudies, and technical reports; (2) Research topics: studies explicitly \ninvolving the application of large language models in medical decision \nsupport, including but not limited to information extraction, decision \nsupport tool development, and patient education functions. The \nexclusion criteria were established as: (1) Publication types: conference \nabstracts, brief reports, editorials, correspondence articles, and \npreprints; (2) Research quality: non-peer-reviewed literature or \nstudies with apparent methodological deficiencies; (3) Accessibility: \nliterature for which full text could not be obtained.\nLiterature screening employed a two-stage independent screening \nmethod. In the first stage, two researchers independently conducted \ntitle and abstract screening using standardized screening forms to \ndocument the decision-making process. The second stage involved \nfull-text evaluation of potentially relevant literature, with strict \napplication of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements during \nthe screening process were resolved through discussion, with \nconsultation of third-party expert opinion when necessary.\n3 Result\n3.1 Literature selection process\nStudy selection process is detailed in Figure 1.\nLi et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1605212\nFrontiers in Public Health 03 frontiersin.org\n3.2 Barriers to the implementation of SDM \nin China\nRobust SDM theoretical frameworks and evidence-based Decision \nAids (DAs), supported by mature clinical protocols, policy \ninfrastructure, and multisectoral support systems in foreign countries, \nestablish a substantive foundation for leveraging LLMs in SDM \napplications. Conversely, SDM research in China remains at the \nexploratory stage, with implementation confronting multidimensional \nsystemic challenges. Identifying these barriers will enable critical \nassessment of LLMs’ capacity to bridge context-specific SDM \nimplementation gaps in China.\nSignificant regional disparities exist in China’s healthcare resource \nallocation, characterized by excessive concentration of high-quality \nresources. This maldistribution creates heavy clinical workloads. \nZhang’s study revealed that 70.5% of tertiary care hospital outpatient \nphysicians averaged ≤10 min per consultation, constraining SDM \nimplementation (17). A critical barrier is the knowledge gap and \ninformation asymmetry between physicians and patients. Research by \nLi et al. indicates that patients have varying comprehension levels, and \ninconsistent online information complicates communication (18). \nMost Chinese DAs constitute direct translations without adequate \ncross-cultural adaptation, failing to address context-specific values \nand health beliefs ( 19). Furthermore, prevailing fee-for-service \nreimbursement structures and clinical productivity-focused \nperformance metrics create insufficient incentives that disincentivize \nSDM adoption (20). Cognitive barriers also exist; while the philosophy \nof SDM has gained theoretical acceptance, substantial discrepancies \npersist in physician and patient perceptions of their respective roles \nduring this process. A survey by Wang et  al. found that surgical \nproviders worried that excessive information disclosure might \nincrease medical risks, while patients often passively accepted \nrecommendations (21). These challenges (summarized in Figure 2) \nhighlight the limitations of traditional SDM models and the potential \nfor innovative technological solutions to enhance SDM practices.\n3.3 Current applications of LLMs in SDM\nIn the context of multiple challenges faced in the implementation \nof SDM in China, technological innovation has become a key pathway \nfor promoting the localization of SDM. The introduction of \ntechnologies such as LLMs can optimize physician-patient \ncommunication, bridge the information gap, and enhance the \nfeasibility and practical effectiveness of SDM while respecting \ncultural characteristics.\nIn healthcare, LLMs are classified into general-purpose models \n(e.g., GPT series) ( 22) and those pre-trained for medical \napplications (e.g., BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, PubMedBERT) ( 23). \nTheir applications include: (1) Intelligent assistant tools integrated \ninto electronic health record (EHR) systems for information \nextraction and summarization ( 24); (2) Natural-language-based \nintelligent diagnostic and treatment recommendation systems, \nwhich support clinical decision-making ( 25); (3) Personalized \nFIGURE 1\nLiterature selection process.\nLi et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1605212\nFrontiers in Public Health 04 frontiersin.org\npatient education and decision-support platforms, enhancing \npatient engagement in the decision-making process ( 26); (4) \nMedical literature analysis and knowledge management tools, \nenabling efficient retrieval and synthesis of scientific findings ( 27); \n(5) Clinical trial design and drug-development support systems, \nassisting in the design and evaluation of research methodologies; \nand (6) Conversational agents for physician-patient communication, \nimproving interaction efficiency and patient comprehension ( 28). \nBuilding on the aforementioned applications of LLMs in the \nhealthcare field, their potential pathways for implementation in \nSDM can be explored.\n3.3.1 Information retrieval and integration\nAccurate and comprehensive information exchange constitutes \nthe foundational element of SDM. LLMs enhance this by extracting \nkey insights from vast amounts of unstructured data, such as EHRs, \nclinical notes, and medical literature, providing evidence-based \nsupport for decision-making ( 29). By utilizing LLM technology, \nhealthcare professionals and patients can make more informed, \ndata-driven decisions. For example, LLMs can extract critical \ninformation like medical history, treatment records, and risk \nfactors, automatically integrate and present these insights to both \nhealthcare professionals and patients. This enhances information \ntransparency and improves communication efficiency (preliminary \nfindings) (30). Research by Du et al. indicates that LLMs streamline \nthe extraction of clinical information from EHRs, reducing \nprocessing time and enhancing decision-making quality \n(preliminary findings) ( 31).\n3.3.2 Development of personalized DAs\nAdvancements in NLP have facilitated the development and \nwidespread adoption of personalized patient DAs. These tools simplify \nmedical terminology and generate patient-friendly, personalized \nreports, delivering tailored recommendations aligned with patient-\nspecific needs. Amit Gupta utilized five LLMs (GPT-4o, Google \nGemini, Claude Opus, Llama-3.1-8B, and Phi-3.5-mini) to simplify \noncology CT reports and compared patients’ comprehension of the \noriginal versus the simplified versions (32). The results indicated that \npatients in the simplified report group had a significantly better \nunderstanding of the primary site and extent of their disease, and \nreported notably higher confidence and comprehension regarding the \ncontent of the report (32). Especially, LLM-driven interactive dialogue \nsystems can accurately identify patient preferences, health conditions, \nand concerns. These systems analyze patient inputs to generate \ndetailed explanations of treatment options, potential risks, and \nexpected outcomes, empowering patients to actively participate in the \ndecision-making process. For example, Brian D. Earp developed a \nPersonalized Patient Preference Predictor (P4) based on LLMs, which \nhas the potential to predict patients’ actual treatment preferences more \naccurately than current approaches that rely on surrogate decision-\nmakers ( 33). These outcomes substantiate LLMs’ transformative \npotential in SDM and offer actionable guidance for designing \nculturally adaptive DAs. Studies indicate that LLMs help patients \nbetter understand their medical options, leading to more active \nparticipation in the decision-making process ( 34). Rietjens et  al. \nreported that LLM-enhanced DAs dynamically adjust information \ndelivery based on the needs of cancer patients making palliative care, \nFIGURE 2\nInfluence factors for SDM implementation in China.\nLi et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1605212\nFrontiers in Public Health 05 frontiersin.org\nincreasing their perceived control and engagement in the decision-\nmaking process (35).\n3.4 Patient sentiment analysis and \npsychological support\nIn the SDM process, patients’ emotional and psychological \nstates significantly impact their decision-making experience and \ntreatment adherence. LLMs use sentiment analysis to detect \nemotional cues like anxiety and confusion, enabling healthcare \nproviders to adjust communication strategies and offer targeted \npsychological support ( 36). Specifically, LLM technology relies on \nNLP and machine learning to annotate emotional expressions in \npatient interactions. By analyzing linguistic cues such as tone, word \nchoice, and sentence structure, LLMs can accurately assess a \npatient’s emotional state (36). For instance, if heightened anxiety is \ndetected, the system flag this concern and notify healthcare \nproviders. Research by Lei et  al. indicates that LLM-driven \nsentiment analysis systems not only recognizes patient emotions \nbut also generates tailored communication recommendations, \nallowing healthcare professionals to provide necessary emotional \nsupport during the decision-making process ( 37) and ensure \npatients feel understood for throughout their medical journey. \nImel’s research highlights that LLM-based sentiment analysis \nenhances communication effectiveness in primary healthcare \nsettings, particularly among emotionally vulnerable patients, \nimproving their decision-making experience ( 38). Consequently, \nleveraging its sentiment analysis capabilities and personalized \nmessaging abilities, LLMs can enhance the quality of physician-\npatient communication.\nIn conclusion, LLMs significantly impact SDM in three areas: \ninformation extraction and integration, personalized DAs, and patient \nsentiment analysis. Empirical evidence demonstrates direct patient \nbenefits in clinical settings. A systematic review synthesizing findings \nfrom seven studies revealed that for brain tumor patients, LLMs \nprovided interactive question-answer sessions explaining the \nindications and side effects of surgery, radiotherapy, and \nchemotherapy, while adjusting information complexity based on \npatients’ cognitive status (15). This personalized approach yielded \nmeasurable outcomes in clinical trials, with patients using \nLLM-assisted decision support reporting a 23% increase in decision \nsatisfaction and 18% improvement in treatment adherence (15). These \nfindings directly address the need for patient-centered applications of \nLLM technology beyond healthcare provider assistance. LLMs boost \npatient engagement, provide evidence-based recommendations and \nimprove physician-patient communication, optimizing the healthcare \ndecision-making experience (Figure 3).\nFIGURE 3\nCurrent applications of LLMs in SDM.\nLi et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1605212\nFrontiers in Public Health 06 frontiersin.org\n3.5 Challenges in implementing LLMs in \nSDM\n3.5.1 The existing universal problems\n3.5.1.1 The limitations of LLMs itself\nPrior to the clinical deployment of large language models \n(LLMs), several inherent challenges must be considered. On one \nhand, while general-purpose LLMs leverage algorithms to produce \nfluent text, their deficiency in foundational medical knowledge can \nlead to the generation of misunderstandings and misinformation; \nOn the other hand, general-purpose LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) lack real-\ntime knowledge updates ( 39). They are limited to retrieving \ninformation available only up to their last training date cutoff. This \nmay lead to their mechanism becoming overloaded, resulting in a \nreduction in the accuracy of the information they provide. Research \nutilizing EHR data from 660 patients demonstrated that the accuracy \nof current models in managing complex clinical conditions remains \nto be improved (40). This suggests that researchers need to conduct \nmore pre-training targeting specific medical and nursing domains \nto improve the performance of general-purpose large language \nmodels (41). Nevertheless, within the clinical medicine domain, data \navailability is often constrained by privacy concerns and regulatory \nrequirements. This poses difficulties for effectively training models. \nFurthermore, how to avoid the biases introduced by using training \ndata from a specific population group is also a major challenge. Data \ntransparency is another obstacle faced by LLMs when applied to \nSDM. Due to the opacity regarding the sources, copyright status, and \nconsent policies of the underlying training data, there are legal and \nethical blind spots. The algorithmic “black box” of LLMs causes the \ntransformation process from input to output to be  partially or \nentirely hidden, resulting in a reduction in their data interpretability \nas well.\n3.5.1.2 The clinical practicality problems existing in LLMs\nThe practical implementation of LLMs in decision support faces \npractical challenges. The recommendations generated by these models \noften lack specific clinical guidance, requiring healthcare professionals \nto spend considerable time on interpretation and modification. \nSystem integration is another major challenge, as most hospital \ninformation systems are relatively closed environments, posing \ntechnical barriers to interfacing with novel AI tools. A systematic \nreview of 26 studies by Y e et  al. highlighted that the absence of \nstandards addressing patient-generated health data (PGHD) use cases \nand consensus on interoperability standards results in variations in \ndata representation and coding that impede data exchange, \nnormalization, and integrity. Significant disparities in system \ncompatibility markedly diminish the utility value of these tools (42). \nFurthermore, information exchange between different hospital \ndepartments and across healthcare institutions remains fragmented, \naffecting the continuity of decision support. Healthcare professionals’ \nacceptance of LLM-based systems also presents a significant barrier. \nDespite ongoing technological advancements, studies indicate that \nover 60% of healthcare providers are hesitant to adopt AI-driven \nsystems due to concerns about transparency and data security. \nAlthough Explainable AI (XAI) has improved the interpretability of \nthese models, lingering concerns regarding model transparency and \ndata security continue to hinder adoption ( 43). This skepticism \ndirectly impacts the effectiveness of AI-driven decision support in \nclinical practice.\n3.5.2 The adaptability issues of LLMs in China\nThe application of LLMs in China’s healthcare system faces \nsignificant localization challenges. One major issue is linguistic and \ncultural adaptation. Most LLMs are trained on English-language \ncorpora, leading to difficulties in processing Chinese medical \nterminology, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). \nResearch by Cao et  al. found that non-localized models had an \naccuracy rate below 60% in TCM diagnostic dialogues, often \nmisinterpreting symptom and syndrome differentiation (44).\nAnother challenge is the adaptation of decision-making model. \nInfluenced by Confucian culture, the family plays a central role in \nmedical decisions ( 19), often limiting patient autonomy, especially \nin cases of major illnesses and geriatric care ( 45). This family-\ncentered decision-making model conflicts with the individual \nautonomy emphasized by modern medicine, necessitating that \nSDM respects patient preferences while also considering family \ninvolvement. In China, medical decision-making typically involves \nmultiple stakeholders, including family members and social \nnetworks, complicating the decision process and increasing \ndemands on LLMs.\nAdditionally, regional adaptability is crucial in China due to \nuneven healthcare resource distribution and varying medical \nconditions across regions. The effectiveness of LLMs in China may \nalign with findings from a multi-center study by Gulnoza et al., which \nemphasized the need for AI decision-support systems to adapt to \nsocio-cultural and dietary differences, particularly in Central Asia \n(46). This underscores the importance of considering regional \ndisparities in healthcare infrastructure for more flexible AI \ndecision-making.\nLastly, compatibility with China’s healthcare insurance policies \nposes another challenge. China’s complex medical insurance and \nreimbursement system influences clinical decision-making. Research \nby He et al. highlighted that current AI decision support systems often \noverlook key policy factors such as reimbursement restrictions and \nthe hierarchical medical system, leading to discrepancies between AI \nrecommendations and actual clinical practices ( 47). To enhance \npractical utility, future optimizations should integrate healthcare \npolicy constraints and align recommendations with China’s \nmedical system.\n4 Discussion and future directions\nConsidering the characteristics of Chinese healthcare system, the \noptimization of LLMs should focus on integrating domain-specific \nknowledge tailored to the Chinese medical landscape.\n4.1 Integration of traditional Chinese \nmedicine and biomedicine knowledge\nMost current LLMs are mainly trained on Western medical \nknowledge, limiting their understanding of TCM theories and \npractices. To improve their applicability, a combined knowledge graph \nof biomedicine and TCM is recommended to enhance interpretation \nLi et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1605212\nFrontiers in Public Health 07 frontiersin.org\nof TCM terminology, syndrome differentiation, and treatment \nmethodologies. Research by Ren Haiyan et al. on the standardization \nof TCM terminology suggests that integrating a TCM ontology-based \nknowledge base with deep learning techniques can significantly \nenhance model accuracy in interpreting TCM clinical dialogues (48). \nAdditionally, enhancing the model’s understanding of culturally \nspecific symptom descriptions in Chinese contexts would improve the \naccuracy of medical history collection.\n4.2 Optimization of multilevel expression \ncapabilities\nDue to health literacy disparities among Chinese patients, LLMs \nshould adjust their language complexity to individual cognitive levels. \nZhou et al. ’s multilevel medical knowledge framework indicates that a \nprogressive explanation strategy enhances comprehension across \ndifferent education levels ( 49). Furthermore, improving dialect \ncomprehension is vital in primary healthcare, as it can increase patient \nengagement in rural areas.\n4.3 Enhancing decision-making \ntransparency and traceability\nImproving the integrity of the decision-making process is another \ncritical area for LLMs optimization. Besides generating decision \nrecommendations, these models should offer explanations to justify \ntheir suggestions, enabling providers to audit the rationale and ensure \ncompliance with clinical guidelines. A study on the interpretability of \nneural network models by Han Wei et al. found that systems with \ndecision traceability capabilities significantly outperformed black-box \nmodels in clinical usability (50).\n4.4 Optimization of family-inclusive \ndecision-making support\nGiven China’s family-centered healthcare decision-making model, \nAI-driven SDM tools should support enable collaborative platforms \nfor remote family participation and provide a comprehensive record \nof the decision-making process. Such platforms would better \naccommodate the socio-cultural context of Chinese healthcare and \nimprove patient and family engagement in shared medical decisions.\n4.5 The role of LLMs in China’s healthcare \nreform\nAs China’s healthcare reform deepens, LLM-driven SDM is \nexpected to promote the fairness, efficiency, and quality of healthcare \nservices. China’s healthcare reform emphasizes goals such as \nhierarchical diagnosis and treatment, improving the capabilities of \nprimary healthcare services, and promoting “Internet+Healthcare. ” \nThe application of LLMs in these areas can significantly enhance the \ncapacity of primary healthcare services and support the \nimplementation of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment. For example, \nLLMs, by incorporating evidence-based medical evidence, can help \nbridge the gap in primary healthcare experience and assist patients in \nunderstanding treatment options ( 51). Additionally, through \nintegration with remote consultation systems, LLMs can facilitate \nefficient communication between primary healthcare providers and \nspecialists from higher-level hospitals, optimizing referral processes. \nFurthermore, LLMs can optimize medical resource allocation and \nreduce costs. By analyzing patient symptoms, LLM-driven dialogue \nsystems can assist with consultations, medical history collection (52), \ndiagnostic recommendations, and more, alleviating the workload of \nhealthcare providers and minimizing the waste of medical resources. \nBy providing transparency in the rationale behind treatment decisions \n(53), LLMs help both patients and healthcare providers collaboratively \nchoose more cost-effective treatment plans, thereby reducing the \nburden on health insurance.\n5 Conclusion\nThis study systematically analyzed the application, challenges, and \nfuture prospects of LLMs in SDM within China’s healthcare system. \nThe findings indicate that SDM in China faces unique challenges, \nincluding cultural traditions, family-centered decision-making \nmodels, and knowledge gap, while also constrained by healthcare \nresource disparities and limited primary care capacity. As an emerging \ntechnological tool, LLMs demonstrated significant potential in \nimproving decision-making efficiency, optimizing information \ntransmission, and enhancing patient engagement, particularly in \naddressing the supply–demand imbalance in China’s healthcare \nsystem. However, the application of LLMs in SDM remains in an \nexploratory stage. From a technical perspective, further advancements \nare needed in integrating TCM knowledge, enhancing multi-level \nexpression capabilities, improving the interpretability of decision-\nmaking processes and optimizating of family-inclusive decision-\nmaking support. As China’s healthcare reform continues to advance, \nthe application of LLMs will further expand. Through ongoing \noptimization of algorithms and datasets, LLMs will play an \nincreasingly significant role across all stages of healthcare service \ndelivery. Looking ahead, as technology matures and practical \nexperience accumulates, LLMs have the potential to become a crucial \ndriving force in advancing SDM in China, ultimately contributing to \na more patient-centered, efficient, and culturally adaptive healthcare \ndecision-making process.\nAuthor contributions\nXL: Writing – original draft, Project administration, Methodology, \nConceptualization.
