  "abstract": "A high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) may pose a significant threat to the electrical power grid. In this context, the present study considers here the potential impact of the HEMP early-time component (E1) on the winding of a typical transmission power line transformer. A time-domain, fully electromagnetic, three-dimensional, finite-element model was used to simulate the propagation of an E1-induced voltage surge into the transformer winding. The analysis is focused on the first few turns of the winding, the ones that are impacted by the largest electric field resulting from the applied pulse. The model follows the transient dynamics, while the pulse is traveling along the conductor, and the electric field is established across the insulation gaps through capacitive coupling. The simulations also considered the effect of an electrically floating, “shield” winding conductor. This is used as a countermeasure to improve the voltage uniformity across the winding during fast-rise transients. In this case, the propagation of the E1-induced pulse is compared with that from a slower rising, lightning standard waveform. The simulation results show that the presence of the shield conductor can effectively reduce the peak electric field between winding turns, in the presence of either E1 or lightning waveforms.",
