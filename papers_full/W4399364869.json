  "abstract": "<ns3:p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer advanced text generation capabilities, sometimes surpassing human abilities. However, their use without proper expertise poses significant challenges, particularly in educational contexts. This article explores different facets of natural language generation (NLG) within the educational realm, assessing its advantages and disadvantages, particularly concerning LLMs. It addresses concerns regarding the opacity of LLMs and the potential bias in their generated content, advocating for transparent solutions. Therefore, it examines the feasibility of integrating OpenLogos expert-crafted resources into language generation tools used for paraphrasing and translation. In the context of the Multi3Generation COST Action (CA18231), we have been emphasizing the significance of incorporating OpenLogos into language generation processes, and the need for clear guidelines and ethical standards in generative models involving multilingual, multimodal, and multitasking capabilities. The Multi3Generation initiative strives to progress NLG research for societal welfare, including its educational applications. It promotes inclusive models inspired by the Logos Model, prioritizing transparency, human control, preservation of language principles and meaning, and acknowledgment of the expertise of resource creators. We envision a scenario where OpenLogos can contribute significantly to inclusive AI-supported education. Ethical considerations and limitations related to AI implementation in education are explored, highlighting the importance of maintaining a balanced approach consistent with traditional educational principles. Ultimately, the article advocates for educators to adopt innovative tools and methodologies to foster dynamic learning environments that facilitate linguistic development and growth.</ns3:p>",
