  "abstract": "Inductive current transformers are characterized by different transformation accuracies for higher harmonics of distorted primary currents. Therefore, it is highly required to perform the tests of their metrological properties to choose the best unit that ensures the lowest values of current error and phase displacement. This study presents a comparison of two manufactured inductive current transformers. The results indicate that some inductive current transformers may be used to accurately transform distorted currents, enabling proper distortion of power metering and quality evaluation. However, to obtain adequate transformation properties in the wide frequency range, the cross-section of the magnetic core of the inductive current transformer should be oversized. Moreover, it is required to use a permalloy magnetic core instead of the typical transformer steel core. In the analyzed case, the metrological performance depends mainly on its accuracy for transforming the main component of the distorted primary current and self-generation of the low-order higher harmonics. This paper constitutes the starting point to define the limiting values of current error and phase displacement for the future wideband accuracy class extension for inductive CTs.",
