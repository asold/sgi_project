INTRODUCTION\nD\nUE TO transportation constraints, the physical size of\nlarge power transformer is very compact, and hence its\nelectromagnetic (EM) load density is very high [1], [2]. The\nstrong ﬁelds will induce heavy eddy current loss in some\nmetallic parts of the transformer, such as the clamp plates, tank\nwall, and the ascending ﬂange of the bushings. There could\nbe local overheating problems and detrimental transient forces\n[3]–[5] if these strong EM ﬁelds are not mitigated carefully in\nthe design stage.\nTo obtain an accurate distribution of the leakage magnetic\nﬁeld in the transformer being studied, tests are carried out and\nthe EM ﬁelds on the up clamp and on the inside surface of the\ntank walls of the transformer are measured. It is found that in the\nvicinity of the clamp plate corresponding to the center lines of\nthe C-phase coils, the maximum ﬂux density\nis higher than\nthe critical overheating limit stipulated by the designer. In a one-\nphase model of the transformer which is constructed to validate\nthe simulation studies, the overheating problem in the clamp\nplates and ascending ﬂange of the bushings are also measured\nusing infrared radiation thermometer.\nEven the clamp plates in the transformer being studied are\nmade of steel with low magnetic permeability and a shield\nis installed on the inside surface of the ascending ﬂange of\nthe bushings to alleviate the overheating problem, they are not\nvery effective in reducing the losses [6], [7]. In this paper a 3-D\nopen boundary eddy current ﬁeld induced by the heavy winding\nand terminal lead current of the transformer being studied is\ncomputed and reported. Eddy current loss and local overheating\nin the tank wall and the ascending ﬂange of the bushings\nare also studied. Proposed means to alleviate overheating and\nexcessive losses in power transformers are also analyzed and\nreported.\nDigital Object Identiﬁer 10.1109/TMAG.2007.914858\nII. FORMULATIONS\nTo analyze the eddy current and losses in transformers, the\n3-D open boundary eddy current ﬁelds satisfying the following\nequations are evaluated [8]–[10]:\nin\n (1)\nin\n (2)\nwhere\n is the source current area;\n is the other area without\nsource current.

It can be seen that the\ncalculated results agree well with the measured ones, thus con-\nﬁrming the proposed approach is an accurate methodology in\nthe study of eddy current ﬁeld and losses in large transformers.\nIII. A\nNALYSIS ANDCALCULA TION\nThe method above is employed to compute the eddy current\nﬁelds and eddy loss in a 720-MV A/500-kV transformer. In the\nnumerical calculation of the eddy current ﬁeld, the total elements\nand nodes are 53 768 and 42 106 and there are 136 732 unknown\nvariables. The preconditioned complex biconjugate gradient\n(PCBCG) method is used to solve the equations. The compu-\ntation time is 282 min using a Pentium IV personal computer\n(2.6 GHz and 1-GB memory). The source programs (FE method)\nsuch as mesh generation, stiffness matrix generation and the\nequation solver are written in Fortran by our research group.\nThe transformer is a newly developed high-power transformer\nwith heavy leakage magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld will induce eddy\ncurrent losses in metallic parts such as the clamp plates, as-\ncending ﬂange of the bushings and tank walls. There are also\nlocal overheating in the aforementioned parts because the losses\nare concentrated in speciﬁc locations. These will induce pyrol-\nysis in the oil and cause degradation in the insulation materials\nto result in reduced reliability. In order to study these problems,\na one-phase transformer model having the same capacity of\none core leg of the 720-MV A three-phase transformer being\nstudied is calculated and tested. The hot spots are all measured\nin the model. It is found that there are indeed overheating in the\nascending ﬂange of the bushings which are made of A3 steel\nplates. The overheating mainly occurs in the edge parts near the\nheavy current leads. There are also overheating in the clamp\nplates as well. In the vicinity of the end windings there are heavy\nleakage ﬁelds that could induce eddy current in the clamp plates\nand pull plates. Though the clamp plates are made of steel with\nlow magnetic permeability, there are still overheating problems\nFig. 2. Sketch of the ascending ﬂange of the bushings of the transformer.\nFig. 3.

Hence it is most likely that the 720-MV A trans-\nformer might also suffer overheating unless effective measures\nare implemented. In order to solve these problems, the 3-D eddy\ncurrent ﬁeld arising from both the heavy current leads and\nthe windings are calculated and analyzed. It is found that the\ntotal loss is 1799 kW, which is the sum of the constant loss of\n320.4 kW and the load loss of 1478.6 kW.\nA. Eddy Current Field Calculation in the Ascending Flange\nof the Bushings\nThe heavy current leads are connected to the phase buses\nthrough the ascending ﬂange of the bushings.

Loss density in the cover plate of the ascending ﬂange for the bushing.\nleads is lager than those in other areas. The distribution of the\neddy current in the cover is not uniform. This may give rise to\nlarge local losses and overheating.\nIn order to alleviate the overheating problems, steel plates\nwith low magnetic permeability (i.e., a relative permeability\nof unity) are used instead of A3 steel plates for the ascending\nﬂange of the transformer bushings. This makes the calculation\nof the 3-D eddy current ﬁeld very complex because it is difﬁ-\ncult to deﬁne the boundary of the solution area. By using steel\nwith low magnetic permeability, the eddy current density in the\ncover is found to have decreased by about 40% as compared\nwith those before. There is no local overheating in the cover\neven though the eddy current density at the edge of the cover is\nstill larger than those in the other areas. Fig. 4 shows the eddy\ncurrent density along the length direction in the cover of the as-\ncending ﬂange of the bushings. Fig. 5 shows the distributions of\nthe losses density in the cover along the length direction.\nB. Eddy Current Field Calculation in the Clamp Plates\nand the Tank Wall\nThe large leakage ﬁeld near the winding ends will induce not\nonly heavy eddy current losses in the clamp plates, it also gives\nFig. 6. Sketch of transformer with magnetic bypass plates.\nFig. 7. Field distribution on the outside surface of the HV coil.\nrise to local overheating. In the transformer, all the clamp plates\nare made of steel with low magnetic permeability in order to\nalleviate the leakage ﬂux problems. In order to obtain an ac-\ncurate distribution of the leakage magnetic ﬁeld in the trans-\nformer, tests have been carried out in which the electromag-\nnetic ﬁelds on the outside surface of the C-phase of the HV\ncoil, on the up clamp and on the inside surface of the tank walls\nhave all been measured. In the region of the clamp plates cor-\nresponding to the center lines of the C-phase coils, the max-\nimum\nis 126 mT which is larger than the critical overheating\nlimit of 26.7 mT. The maximum loss density is 46 kW/m\nbe-\nfore installing the magnetic bypass plates (MBP) to be described\nlater. In the one-phase transformer model of the 720-MV A trans-\nformer, the thermal proﬁle in the clamp plates are measured\nusing infrared thermometers to check whether there are poten-\ntial overheating problems. Besides using low magnetic perme-\nability steel clamp plates, the MBP scheme is designed to reduce\nthe losses of the clamp plates to alleviate local overheating. The\nMBP plates, which are made of silicon sheets, are installed near\nthe clamp plates so as to provide a path for the leakage magnetic\nﬁeld at the end of the three phase coils in the MBP plates. The\nleakage magnetic ﬁeld in the clamp plates, pull plates and so on\ncan be reduced with this arrangement. Fig. 6 gives the sketch of\nthe windings, clamp plates, and the MBP.\nFig. 7 gives the ﬁeld distribution on the outside surface of\nthe HV coil. Fig. 8 shows the distribution of the\n-direction\nmagnetic ﬂux density\n along the length direction of the up\nclamp plate. The analyzed area is corresponding to a region\nof the C-phase coil. The maximum magnetic ﬂux density is\n16.6 mT which is less than the aforementioned criterion after\ninstalling the MBP plates. Hence there is no local overheating\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Downloaded on March 13, 2009 at 04:11 from IEEE Xplore.

Meanwhile, the maximum loss density is re-\nduced to 2.2kW/m\n. The calculated results of the magnetic ﬂux\ndensity in the up clamp plate are observed to agree well with the\ntest results. By designing the parameters of the MBP plate, such\nas the parameters a, b, c, d, and e in Fig. 6, the maximum loss\ndensity in the plates can be reduced by 94%. In this scheme,\nmm,\n mm,\n mm,\n mm, and\nmm. Table III gives a comparison of the loss density\nin the clamp plate from the middle to the end along the axial\ndirection. In other words, the MBP plate is effective in reducing\nthe losses of these parts to avoiding local overheating.\nIn computing the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the MBP plates, the\nmaximum magnetic ﬂuxdensity isfoundtobe1.33Twhich is less\nthan the saturation ﬂux density. Moreover, the measured value is\n1.23 T and this compares well with the computed one. The eddy\ncurrent loss in the MBP plate is small because they are made of\nsilicon sheets. The design of the MBP plates is thus successful.\nAs the loss in the tank wall is high, a 4-mm-thick copper\nshield is used to alleviate the overheating problem in the tank\nwall. The total losses in the copper shield and tank wall are then\nreduced by 80% as compared to that with an unshielded tank\nwall. Meanwhile, the maximum loss density is reduced from\n1400 to 60 kW/m\nin the tank wall. Fig. 9 gives the distribution\nof the eddy current loss density in the tank wall along the length\ndirection from the transformer center.\nIV . CONCLUSION\nThis paper presents an accurate 3-D formulation to study the\nboundary eddy current ﬁeld arising from the heavy winding and\nterminal lead currents in a compact power transformer. Eddy\ncurrent loss and local overheating in the tank wall and the as-\ncending ﬂange of the bushings are also studied.\nAfter identifying the hotspots, the designers propose to use\nsteel plates with low magnetic permeability as the ascending\nﬂange for the bushings, and it is found that the eddy current\ndensity of the cover becomes lower than those in the A3 steel\nplates. With this arrangement overheating can be avoided in the\n720-MV A transformer. Even though it is very costly to build\na full-size model to validate the ﬁndings, a very comprehen-\nsive test has been carried out on a full-size one-phase model\nto validate the predictions. Proposed means to alleviate over-\nheating and excessive losses in power transformers are also an-\nalyzed. The transformer losses are reduced signiﬁcantly after\nthe magnetic bypass plates are optimized and overheating in the\nclamping plates is avoided.\nA\nCKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by the Polytechnic University,\nunder Project 1-BBZ7 and by the Research Grant Council of\nthe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, under\nProject PolyU 5242/04E.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] R.
