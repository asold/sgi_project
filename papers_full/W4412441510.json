    "abstract": "Radiology education is challenged by increasing clinical workloads, limiting trainee supervision time and hindering real-time feedback. Large language models (LLMs) can enhance radiology education by providing real-time guidance, feedback, and educational resources while supporting efficient clinical workflows. We present an interpretation-centric framework for integrating LLMs into radiology education subdivided into distinct phases spanning predictation preparation, active dictation support, and postdictation analysis. In the predictation phase, LLMs can analyze clinical data and provide context-aware summaries of each case, suggest relevant educational resources, and triage cases based on their educational value. In the active dictation phase, LLMs can provide real-time educational support through processes such as differential diagnosis support, completeness guidance, classification schema assistance, structured follow-up guidance, and embedded educational resources. In the postdictation phase, LLMs can be used to analyze discrepancies between trainee and attending reports, identify areas for improvement, provide targeted educational recommendations, track trainee performance over time, and analyze the radiologic entities that trainees encounter. This framework offers a comprehensive approach to integrating LLMs into radiology education, with the potential to enhance trainee learning while preserving clinical efficiency.",
