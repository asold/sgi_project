  "abstract": "This paper proposes a transformer fault diagnosis method based on ACGAN and CGWO-LSSVM to address the problem of misjudgment and low diagnostic accuracy caused by the small number and uneven distribution of some fault samples in transformer fault diagnosis. Firstly, generate adversarial networks through auxiliary classification conditions, The ACGAN method expands a small and imbalanced number of samples to obtain balanced and expanded data; Secondly, the non coding ratio method is used to construct the characteristics of dissolved gases in oil, and kernel principal component analysis is used, KPCA method for feature fusion; Finally, using the improved cubic gray wolf optimization algorithm, CGWO for least square support vector machines, optimize the parameters of the LSSVM model and construct a transformer fault diagnosis model. The results show that the proposed method has a low false alarm rate and a diagnostic accuracy of 97.66%, compared to IGOA-LSSVM the IChOA-LSSVM and PSO-LSSVM methods improved accuracy by 0.12, 1.76, and 2.58%, respectively. This method has been proven to solve the problems of misjudgment and low diagnostic accuracy caused by small sample sizes and uneven distribution. It is suitable for multi classification fault diagnosis of transformer imbalanced datasets and is superior to other methods.",
