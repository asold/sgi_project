    "abstract": "The transition from the conventional power systems to smart grids has led to the modernisation of the measuring infrastructure used for their monitoring and control. Among the devices used to accomplish these tasks, phasor measurement units (PMUs) play a key role since they can provide extremely accurate synchronised voltage and current phasor measurements. The optimal PMU placement (OPP) problem, which focuses on minimising the number of PMUs for full system observability, has long been a popular research topic. The vast majority of the available OPP techniques have treated each transformer tap setting (voltage turns ratio and phase‐shifting angle) as a fixed network parameter. Such an assumption can lead to misdirecting residuals in adjacent valid measurements when the modelled tap setting is incorrect. The aim of this study is to propose a substation‐oriented OPP method based on a binary semidefinite programming algorithm, considering the observability of the transformer tap settings and the limited PMU channel capacity. The method is illustrated using an 8‐bus test system. Numerical results using different size IEEE systems are presented and discussed. The proposed approach is further applied to the Polish 3120‐bus system to show its efficacy in solving the OPP problem for large‐scale power systems.",
