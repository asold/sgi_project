  "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those capable of natural language processing, are increasingly becoming integral to diverse aspects of human life and interaction. Understanding the cultural biases embedded within AI, especially in how it aligns with specific cultural values, is crucial for ensuring its effective and equitable deployment. This research examines the alignment of AI-generated responses with mainstream Chinese cultural values, such as Confucian harmony, Daoist balance, collectivism, respect for authority, and family-centric principles. By analyzing responses in both Chinese and English, the study highlights the discrepancies and cultural biases inherent in AI systems, offering valuable insights into their implications for AI development. The findings reveal that while AI demonstrates general alignment with Chinese values, significant variations exist between language contexts, emphasizing the importance of cultural and linguistic specificity in AI interactions. Quantitative metrics and thematic analyses demonstrate the necessity for culturally aware AI, contributing to the broader discourse on ethical AI development and providing guidance for creating more inclusive and adaptable AI systems.",
