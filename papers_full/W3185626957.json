  "abstract": "Phase shifting transformers (PSTs) are currently widely used in power systems to control power flow. In this manuscript, the results of the asymmetrical PST (APST) with the in-phase PST (called asymmetrical controllable PST-ACPST) were compared, allowing to control both longitudinal and quadrature voltage. The MATLAB simulation model of the ACPST was built to obtain influence of PST in selected models for selected parameters. Then the 30A laboratory PST device was built in the laboratory. The parameters of the MATLAB model were then adjusted to parameters of the real life PST model. This allowed verifying the results of the real life and computer simulations. Based on the ACPST simulation model, the APST model was built; for the given work conditions, the influence of both PSTs were compared. APST construction always resulted in higher output voltage than the input one. ACPST achieved the same power transfer for the lower output PST voltage, which is its main advantage. This dependency is a result of the greater ACPST angle compared to the classical APST. The ACPST also allowed adjusting longitudinal and quadrature voltages; therefore, this PST type can be installed in places where high flexibility is required, especially in systems with high renewable energy sources penetration.",
