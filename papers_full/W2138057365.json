  "abstract": "The overall life of oil-immersed power transformers depends on the long-term life of the oil–paper insulation system throughout continuous operation. Studying the reliability assessment methods for oil–paper insulation can help determine the reliability level of power transformers accurately, and ensure their safe and stable operation. In the present paper, the life of oil–paper insulation is proven to obey the Weibull distribution under eight different temperatures set by the Weibull reliability probability paper; the failure mechanisms of the different temperatures are highly consistent. The Weibull distribution reliability curve cluster of oil–paper insulation is plotted under different temperatures by which an oil–paper insulation reliability assessment method is proposed. Lastly, the statistical validation experiment of the proposed method is conducted, which proves its theoretical validity. Thus, the present study puts forward a simple and effective method for the oil–paper insulation reliability assessment of power transformers under different temperatures at different life stages.",
