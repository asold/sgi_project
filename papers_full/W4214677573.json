With that observation, \ntool use was relegated to the ever-growing list of traits that \ndo not make us human. Since then, the list of animals that \nuse tools has been growing, and definitions of what consti-\ntutes tool use have also changed. Current definitions gener-\nally describe tools as objects derived from the environment \nthat animals use to modify or adjust other objects or them-\nselves (Bentley-Condit 2010). The best known animal tool \nusers are vertebrates, of course. Perhaps that is why the phy-\nlogenetic breadth of animal tool use remains under-appre-\nciated, and why it is still surprising to learn that tool use \nalso occurs in at least 38 genera of invertebrates, including \nmolluscs, crustaceans, and insects, (Bentley-Condit 2010). \nAmong insect tool users are eight ant genera, in which tool \nuse is mainly associated with foraging behaviour.\nAnt tool use was first documented in four Aphaenogaster \nspecies that use tools to carry liquid food to their nests \n(Fellers and Fellers 1976). These ants lack extensible crops, \nso are unable to carry large volumes of liquids internally. \nThis means that when they discover liquid or very soft food \nsources, they cannot efficiently carry the food back to their \nnests. A solution to this problem is to use a tool that, like a \nsponge, can absorb or be coated with the food and then car-\nried home. Ants accomplish this by dropping grains of soil, \nsand, pieces of leaf, small twigs, or other absorbent objects \ninto the liquid food, waiting a short time for the tool to \nabsorb the food, then retrieving it and carrying it to the nest. \nAnts that can use tools like this not only might forage more \nefficiently, but might also be more competitive against other \nants using the same food sources, but without tools (Fell-\ners and Fellers 1976). Subsequent studies of Aphaenogaster \nhave suggested that within colonies, only some workers use \ntools (Banschbach et al. 2006), that they are selective in the \ntools that they choose, and that tool usage can improve with \nexperience (Maák et al. 2017). In some cases, ant workers \neven use pieces of sponge for this task, cutting the sponge \ninto apparently more manageable pieces (Maák et al. 2017).\nIn this issue, Gábor Módra and colleagues continue \ntheir studies of foraging tool use by ants, with a compari-\nson of two species with different foraging habits (Módra \net al. 2021). They test the hypothesis that tool use should \nbe more frequently observed in ants in which soft or liquid \nfood, such as honeydew, rotten fruit or liquefying corpses \nof arthropods, represents a significant portion of their diet. \nGranivores, such as Messor structor that rarely exploit liq-\nuid foods would have little need for tools, and so might be \nexpected to use them less frequently or not at all. In con-\ntrast, omnivores such as Aphaenogaster subterranea that do \nexploit liquid food sources could benefit substantially from \nusing tools, and so would be expected to use tools more fre-\nquently. Módra and colleagues predicted that Aphaenogaster \nworkers would use tools sooner and more frequently than \nMessor workers, and would also be choosier about which \ntools they selected.\nMódra et al.’s study was carried out in a laboratory set-\nting. Five colonies of each species were collected and estab-\nlished in plastic boxes connected by tunnels to a foraging \narea where foraging workers could be observed. After being \nstarved for four days to ensure that they would be hungry, \nants were supplied with honey–water and six types of objects \nthat could be used as tools: sand grains, small and large soil \ngrains, pieces of pine needles, pieces of leaves, and pieces \nof sponges. The tools were mixed together and placed near \nthe honey–water baits, as previous studies suggest that ants \nare more likely to use tools near the food source. Once the \nfirst workers found the honey–water, observations com-\nmenced, continuing for 5 h. As predicted, Aphaenogaster  \ncolonies dropped and retrieved tools much more often than \nMessor colonies. Their latency to tool usage was also much \nshorter—they dropped and retrieved tools sooner in the \nexperiments. In fact, Aphaenogaster  colonies used tools \nso efficiently that they used up all their food by the end of \nthe 5-h experiment, whereas Messor colonies consumed \nonly a small portion of their food. In other words, having \nInsectes Sociaux\n * M. H. Richards \n mrichards@brocku.ca\n1 Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada\n2 M. H. Richards \n1 3\nappropriate tools for carrying home the groceries, really did \nenhance foraging efficiency.\nAn enduring mystery is how this tool use behaviour came \nto evolve. One possibility is that before objects such as sand \ngrains were used as sponges, they were used to cover or hide \nfood sources from competitors. Another proposal is that ants \ncould prevent entanglement of foragers in sticky messes by \ncovering them with small objects. Addressing these hypothe-\nses would require observations of tool use in natural settings, \nbut as yet, there is almost no direct evidence of ant tool use \nin natural settings without artificial baits. Observations of \nants licking or carrying objects with absorbed food are not \nenough to demonstrate tool use—it is necessary to demon-\nstrate that the ants select objects, put them in the food, and \nthen carry the objects back to their nests. Field studies of ant \ntool use would undoubtedly be challenging, but perhaps a \nfirst step would be inducing field colonies to forage at food \nbaits near nest entrances.\nReferences\nBanschbach VS, Brunelle A, Bartlett KM et al (2006) Tool use by the \nforest ant aphaenogaster rudis: ecology and task allocation.
