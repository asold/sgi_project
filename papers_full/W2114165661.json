In the context of a\ntrial to improve newborn health in southern Tanzania, a counselling card was developed that incorporated a\nnewborn foot length measurement tool to screen newborns for low birth weight and prematurity. This was used\nby community volunteers at home visits and shows a scale picture of a newborn foot with markers for a‘short foot’\n(<8 cm). The tool built on previous hospital based research that found newborn foot length <8 cm to have\nsensitivity and specificity to identify low birthweight (<2500 g) of 87% and 60% respectively.\nMethods: Reliability of the tool used by community volunteers to identify newborns with short feet was tested.\nBetween July-December 2010 a researcher accompanied volunteers to the homes of babies younger than seven\ndays and conducted paired measures of newborn foot length using the counselling card tool and using a plastic\nruler. Intra-method reliability of foot length measures was assessed using kappa scores, and differences between\nmeasurers were analysed using Bland and Altman plots.\nResults: 142 paired measures were conducted. The kappa statistic for the foot length tool to classify newborns as\nhaving small feet indicated that it was moderately reliable when applied by volunteers, with a kappa score of 0.53\n(95% confidence interval 0.40– 0.66) . Examination of differences revealed that community volunteers systematically\nunderestimated the length of newborn feet compared to the researcher (mean difference−0.26 cm (95% confidence\ninterval −0.31— 0.22), thus overestimating the number of newborns needing extra care.\nConclusions: The newborn foot length tool used by community volunteers to identify small babies born at home was\nmoderately reliable in southern Tanzania where a large number of births occur at home and scales are not available.\nNewborn foot length is not the best anthropometric proxy for birthweight but was simple to implement at home in\nthe first days of life when the risk of newborn death is highest.\n* Correspondence:Tanya.Marchant@lshtm.ac.uk\n1Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Disease, London School of Hygiene and\nTropical Medicine, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, UK\n2MARCH (Maternal, Adolescent, Reproductive and Child Health Centre),\nLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London\nWC1E 7HT, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2014 Marchant et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Public Health2014, 14:859\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/859\nBackground\nIn 2012, the identification of low birth weight infants\n(<2500 g) within 48 hours of birth among those born at\nhome was ranked by scientists and public health practi-\ntioners as the number one research priority to reduce\nglobal mortality from preterm birth and low birth weight\n[1]. Low birth weight infants need additional care: each\nyear in sub-Saharan Africa an estimated 1.2 million new-\nborns die during the first month of life [2]. Being born\ntoo small – because of low birth weight, prematurity, or\nintra-uterine growth retardation – is a very strong pre-\ndictor of newborn mortality [3,4]. Life saving interven-\ntions [5] implemented in the community and in health\nfacilities could save as many as 85% of African maternal,\nnewborn and child deaths if optimal coverage was\nachieved, [6] but despite some improvements, interven-\ntion coverage still remains low for the majority of fam-\nilies across Africa [7].\nOne immediate obstacle to realising the full potential\nto save lives is that, despite a global increase in skilled\nattendance at birth in the last decade, around half of all\nbirths in Africa continue to occur at home, [8,9] and\nmost families have no contact with formal health ser-\nvices during the first week of a newborn’s life. In such\nsettings, community health workers or volunteers have\nconsiderable potential to improve newborn survival by\npromoting skin-to-skin contact, thermal care, immediate\nand frequent breastfeeding, and active care seeking [10].\nA meta-analysis of studies to evaluate the impact of\nhome visits to newborns in programmatic settings esti-\nmated a 12% reduction in newborn mortality, equivalent\nto a five percent reduction in overall child mortality [11].\nOne persistent limitation of home visits is that com-\nmunity members, including volunteers, usually lack the\ntools and measurement skills with which to identify\nnewborns as small and at-risk. We previously reported a\nhospital based study showing that short foot length had\nthe potential to be used as a low-cost tool to identify\nlow birth weight or preterm newborns born at home in\nthe event that weighing scales and clinical assessment\nwere not available [12].\nHere we report on a community based study to esti-\nmate the reliability of a simple foot length measurement\ntool used by community volunteers to identify low birth\nweight or premature babies born at home in the first\ndays of life.\nMethods\nSetting\nThe INSIST project (Improving Newborn Survival in\nSouthern Tanzania, clinical trials identifier NCT01022788)\naimed to develop, implement and evaluate a community\nbased package for improved newborn care, focussing on\nhome-based counselling visits by community volunteers\nto women in pregnancy and the early neonatal period.\nThe community-based package was implemented in half\nof all wards in six districts of Lindi and Mtwara Regions\nwhich are characterised as rural with a predominantly un-\npaved road network. The most common occupations are\nsubsistence farming and small scale trading, and neonatal\nand infant mortality are high [13,14]. Neonatal and infant\nmortality in the area are high (estimated to be 43/1000\nand 76/1000 live births respectively) [13]. Around half\nof babies are born in a health facility, [15] and the public\nhealth system offers a varying quality of care [13,14].\nThe INSIST project developed a counselling card for\ncommunity volunteers to use when promoting healthy\nnewborn behaviours in the home (Figure 1). Families are\ngiven their own copy of this card, and community volun-\nteers have a laminated version. To aid community iden-\ntification of low birth weight or preterm newborns, the\ncard also shows a scale picture of a newborn foot show-\ning cut-offs for very short (<7 cm) and short (7.0-\n7.9 cm) feet, and not short (8.0 + cm) . These categories\nof foot length were reported to be indicative of low birth\nweight or prematurity [12]. It is this measurement tool\nthat is evaluated here.\nStudy design and participants\nThis was a cross sectional study of paired observations\nof newborn foot length, using the laminated counselling\ncard, with one observation in each pair being done by a\nproject researcher and the second by the community\nvolunteers. In addition, the researcher and volunteers\nalso measured foot length using a plastic ruler. Based on\nprevious research [12] 50% of newborns were expected\nto have a foot length shorter than 8 cm (a proxy for\nbirth weight less than or more than 2500 g). 143 obser-\nvation pairs would be sufficient to estimate an expected\nkappa of 0.4 and its 95% confidence interval (indicating\nfair agreement between different observers using the\nsame measurement tool) for rating newborns as having\nfeet shorter or longer than 8 cm.\nFigure 1Using the counselling card to categorise newborn\nfoot length as“very short” (<7 cm),“short” (7–7.9 cm) or“not\nshort” (8 + cm) in Mtwara Region, Tanzania (here showing a\nnewborn with“not short” foot length).\nMarchant et al. BMC Public Health2014, 14:859 Page 2 of 6\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/859\nThe community volunteers attend quarterly review\nmeetings to share results, review their experience of\ncounselling families, and plan for the next quarter. Be-\ntween July and December 2010, volunteers attending\nthese review meetings in all six districts of the INSIST\nproject were asked to identify any newborns in their vil-\nlages who were less than 7 days old at the time of the\nmeeting. Within 24 hours of each review meeting a joint\nhome visit was then made to these infants by a member\nof the research staff (EM) and the individual community\nvolunteer.\nAt the home visit, the age of the newborn was con-\nfirmed, and consent to proceed sought from the care-\ngiver, with the exception of those newborns who were\nover seven days of age on the day of visit, or who\nshowed signs of distress. For consenting newborns, a\nstandard operating procedure was followed to measure\nnewborn foot length. First, the community volunteer\ncategorised the newborn foot length using the laminated\ncounselling card by placing the right foot against the\nprinted picture and reading whether length was above or\nbelow labelled measurement lines), then recorded the\nnewborn foot length (right foot) in centimetres (to one\ndecimal place) using a hard transparent plastic ruler. Fi-\nnally, the researcher repeated both measures. Each new-\nborn was assigned a unique identification number and\nall measures were conducted independently and findings\nrecorded on separate forms.\nTraining and quality control\nImmediately prior to the start of data collection, the re-\nsearcher spent two consecutive days at Ligula hospital,\ntogether with a paediatrician, each day measuring the\nfoot length of a minimum of ten newborns using both\nthe counselling card and the ruler. Community volun-\nteers received an explanation about how to measure\nnewborn foot length as part of their initial 5-day training\nby INSIST, were provided with written instructions\nabout how to use the counselling card, and had the\nopportunity to ask questions about its implementation\nduring quarterly review meetings. One in ten home visits\nwas accompanied by a second researcher (JJ) to check\nthat standard procedures were being followed.\nData processing and statistical analysis\nData were recorded on paper forms at the newborn ’s\nhouse and within 48 hours forms were returned to the\nproject office where they were double entered and rec-\nonciled in Epi-info.\nCharacteristics of the newborns, their mothers, and\nthe community volunteers were summarised, and the\nfoot length outcomes derived from the ruler and the\ncounselling card calculated. The intra-method reliability\nof the counselling card used by the volunteers or the\nresearcher to detect small babies was estimated using\nkappa statistics [16]. Foot length measures were sum-\nmarised, and the mean difference and standard deviation\ncalculated. The extent of agreement between the two\nmeasurers was further examined by generating Bland\nand Altman plots [17] which plot the differences be-\ntween pairs of measurement against the mean of each\npair of measures.\nEthical approval\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of Ifakara Health Institute, Tanzania, the Medical\nResearch Coordinating Committee, Tanzania, and the\nLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.\nWritten, informed consent was obtained from the care-\ngiver of each infant in the study.\nResults\nStudy population\nBetween 21 July 2010 and 7 Jan 2011 the researcher\naccompanied 119 community volunteers (median age\n30 years) to the homes of 144 mothers (median age\n26 years) and their newborns (median age 4 days, range\n1– 7), from across all 6 districts of the project. Complete\ndata were recorded for 142 newborns and are analysed\nhere. All volunteers had completed primary education,\nand 27% (32/119) had attended some secondary schooling.\nCategorising babies as small using the counselling card\nForty six percent (95% CI 38– 55, n = 66/142) of newborns\nwere categorised as having short foot length (<8 cm) by\nthe researcher, and 59% (95% CI 51– 67, n = 84 of 142) by\nthe community volunteer (Table 1).\nTable 1 Newborn foot lengths measured by community\nvolunteers and researcher using a hard transparent\nplastic ruler and using the counselling card\nCommunity volunteer\nN = 142\nResearcher N = 142\nMean length in cm (SD) 7.8 (0.3) 8.1 (0.3)\nRange (cm) 7.0 - 8.7 7.2 – 8.8\nn,% (95% confidence\ninterval)\nn,% (95% confidence\ninterval)\nRuler measures\ncategorised:\n<7 cm 0 0\n7.0-7.9 cm 77, 54% (46 –63) 49, 35% (27 –43)\n≥8 cm 65, 46% (37 –54) 93, 65% (57 –73)\nCounselling card\ncategories:\n<7 cm 4, 3% (0 –7) 1, 1% (0 –4)\n7.0-7.9 cm 80, 56% (48 –65) 65, 46% (37 –54)\n≥8 cm 58, 41% (33 –49) 76, 54% (45 –62)\nMarchant et al. BMC Public Health2014, 14:859 Page 3 of 6\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/859\nReliability of the counselling card tool\nThe kappa statistic for agreement between the researcher\nand volunteer assessments using the counselling card was\n0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.40-0.66; expected agree-\nment 49%, actual agreement 76%), a value usually inter-\npreted as reflecting moderate agreement [16].\nPattern of difference between measurers\nThe pattern of difference was examined in more detail\nusing the plastic ruler foot length estimates, recorded in\ncentimetres. On average, the researcher recorded longer\nfoot lengths than did the community volunteers (Table 1).\nThe mean foot length recorded by the researcher was\n0.26 cm longer that that recorded by the volunteers (SD\n0.27, 95% confidence interval of difference between the\nmeans 0.22-0.30). There was a positive skew in the distri-\nbution of difference between researcher and volunteer\nmeasures (Figure 2), and after plotting the difference\nagainst the average of paired measures no evidence of bias\nfor different sized feet was observed (Figure 3).\nDiscussion\nIn this community based study we have shown that a\nnewborn foot length measurement tool, printed on a\ncounselling card, can be used at the community level\nwith moderate reliability by community volunteers who\nhave received 5 days of training in total, which included\napproximately 5 hours on foot size measurement. This\ntraining was supplemented by quarterly review meetings,\nlasting a few hours each time, at which volunteers were\nencouraged to discuss their experiences from the field.\nQualitative and quantitative evidence from the study\narea [15,18] informed the healthy newborn behaviours\nto be promoted by INSIST volunteers during the main\nINSIST trial. The key behaviours were hygiene during\nchildbirth, immediate and exclusive breastfeeding, and\nextra care, including skin to skin care, for low birth weight\nor premature babies. In order to identify low birth weight\nor premature newborns, volunteers required a simple and\neasily sustainable identification tool. Key stakeholders at\nnational level advised that weighing scales would not be\nsustainable, and many primary health care facilities do not\nhave scales, thus the foot length tool was developed [19].\nOur findings show that community volunteers tended to\nunder estimate newborn foot length. The implication of\nthis may have been that a large number of newborns were\nsaid to be in need of extra care, something that could have\nled volunteers and parents to lose confidence in the iden-\ntification tool. Nonetheless, by putting focus on examining\nthe newborn, the tool may have provided a starting point\nfor discussion with parents about whether or not they\nthought that their baby needed extra care– beyond that\nrecommended for every newborn - in the first days of life.\nThe issue of early care seeking from formal health pro-\nviders urgently needs to be addressed. A meta-analysis of\ncare seeking for neonatal illness in low and middle income\ncountries [20] highlighted that there is a paucity of high\nquality data on the subject, especially from Africa, and es-\ntimated that just 20% of caregivers of sick newborns re-\nported seeking care from a health care provider outside\nthe home. In southern Tanzania, previous studies have\nsuggested that care seeking is particularly low for babies\nborn at home [14]– precisely the group of newborns that\nwere targeted by the foot length tool.\nThe goal of health care providers is to have contact\nwith every newborn at birth (through facility delivery) or\nFigure 2Distribution of differences between researcher and community volunteer ruler measures of 142 newborn feet (cm).\nMarchant et al. BMC Public Health2014, 14:859 Page 4 of 6\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/859\nimmediately after (through post-natal care) and take a\nhigh quality measure of birth weight to inform decision\nmaking about any care needed. But sub-optimal cover-\nage of institutional deliveries and post-natal care means\nthat around half the newborns of sub-Saharan Africa\ndo not have this opportunity and alternative methods\nto identify small babies should be encouraged if they\ncan be linked to identification of newborn danger signs.\nIn an analysis of Demographic and Health Survey\ndata from three countries, [21] mother’s perception of a\nbaby’s size at birth was found to be closely linked to\nbirth weight at national levels, although within commu-\nnities there was considerable variation in size percep-\ntions. The authors concluded that care was needed when\ninterpreting individual maternal perceptions because of\nthe influence of other variables such as gender of the\nchild, place of birth, and the size of other babies in the\nlocal community.\nMeasuring newborn foot length has been found to be\nacceptable, [12] but of the anthropometric proxies for\nlow birth weight it is not the most accurate. Our earlier\nhospital based study estimated the sensitivity and specifi-\ncity of foot length <8 cm to predict low birth weight\n(<2500 g) to be 0.87 and 0.60 respectively [12]. A meta-\nanalysis of evidence from hospital studies concluded\nthat chest circumference had the highest accuracy when\npredicting low birth weight, compared to other an-\nthropometric measures, [22] but its main limitation for\napplication in a community setting was that it can be\ndifficult to measure accurately without medical training,\nand can be disruptive to the newborn since it requires\nundressing [23,24]. Further to this, integrating the foot\nlength tool as a printed image on a counselling card may\nnot have been the most accurate method of determining\nfoot length, and some discordant categorisation was ob-\nserved between the counselling card and the ruler. But\nhaving just one simple, cheap, locally produced tool for\nvolunteers to carry and explain, and being able to leave a\ncopy of this tool with families, may have outweighed this\nlimitation by removing important barriers to its use.\nConclusions\nA simple newborn foot length measurement tool can be\napplied by community volunteers with moderate reliabil-\nity. However, using this tool volunteers over estimated\nthe number of small newborns needing extra care by\nthirteen percent compared to estimates by the project\nresearcher. Newborn foot length is simple to understand,\neasy to construct and can be implemented at home in\nthe first days of life when the risk of newborn death is\nhighest, but monitoring its use and providing supportive\nsupervision to users of the tool is important.\nCompeting interests\nNo competing interests are declared.\nAuthors' contributions\nTM and JAS were responsible for the study concept and design and\nstatistical analysis.
