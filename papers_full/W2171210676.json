INTRODUCTION\nImpedance transformers are one of the important components\napplied in microwave and millimeter-wave circuits, such as microwave\nampliﬁers, power dividers, mixers, the feeding networks for a smart\nantenna array [1–12]. The quarter-wavelength transmission line (TL)\nis a conventional basic impedance transformer designed to operate\nat a single band. In 2002, Chow and Wan introduced a dual-band\ntwo-section 1/3-wavelength transformer operating at the fundamental\nfrequency and its ﬁrst harmonic in [7]. Then Monzon analyzed and\nderived its close-form solutions [8], and further proposed a small two-\nsection dual-frequency transformer working at any two uncorrelated\nReceived 29 April 2013, Accepted 31 May 2013, Scheduled 9 July 2013\n* Corresponding author: Xin-Huai Wang (xinhwang@mail.xidian.edu.cn).\n34 Wang et al.\nfrequencies on purely real impedance transformation [9]. An L-\ntype impedance transformer is also developed for the same purpose\nin [10]. The meaningful improvements have been reported in [11],\nand [12], extending the impedance transformer for complex load at\nthe third harmonics’ frequency or independent frequencies. Dual-band\nimpedances transformers are widely applied to generalized branch-\nline couplers, power dividers, etc. [13–23]. The growing trend\ntowards multi-band products has increased the demand for multi-band\nimpedance transformers. Extending from the concept of the dual-band\ntransformer in [9], the tri-band transformers bases on three-section\ntransmission lines for matching real impedances at three frequencies\nare proposed in [18], which can only work at the frequency ratio\nrange between assigned frequencyf0 and its third harmonic. Then we\npresent a compact quad-frequency impedance transformer composed\nof a two-section coupled-line to achieve ideal impedance matching four\nfrequencies in [24]. In addition, a new analytical method to synthesize\npassive networks uncorrelated and unlimited number of frequencies\nis presented in [25]. However, it can only design to match purely\nimaginary loads. In recent years, researchers further focus on the\nareas of increasing the operating bandwidth and matching a complex\nimpedance load [26–29].\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach to match a real\nimpedance load at three uncorrelated frequencies by using a stubbed\ncoupling line impedance transformer. The presented transformer\nconsists of two parts. Each part is constructed from parallel-\ncoupled transmission lines. Two diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the\nproposed transformer are analyzed and discussed. The design\nequations are carefully derived and analyzed by using transmission\nline theory. Furthermore, the range of frequency ratio is analytically\nand numerically deduced. To certify the feasibility and validity of the\nproposed impedance transformer, three diﬀerent cases are numerically\nevaluated. A transformer working at 0.9 GHz/1.8 GHz/3.2 GHz is\nfabricated and measured to verify the proposed structure, which may\nbe applied in the present global system for mobile communication\n(GSM), the personal communication (PCS) and Wi-Max. Good\nagreements between simulated and measured results are obtained.\n2. THE STRUCTURE AND ANALYTICAL EQUATIONS\nThe schematic structure of the proposed tri-band transformer line is\nshown in Fig. 1. The circuit is simply consists of two coupled line\nsections T and S, which one is the transmission coupled line section\nT and the other is the stubbed coupled line sectionS shunted at the\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 141, 2013 35\n(a) stub at the load (b) stub at the source\nFigure 1.Structure of the proposed tri-band transformer line (a) stub\nat the load, (b) stub at the source.\nload end (Fig. 1(a)) or at the source end (Fig. 1(b)).\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the coupled line sectionT and S odd- and\neven-mode characteristic impedance areZte, Zto and Zse, Zso and the\nimage impedance of coupled-line sectionT and coupled-line sectionS\nare Zt and Zs. The insert phase of coupled-line sectionT and coupled-\nline sectionS are φt and φs. According to Jones’ theory in [30], here we\nset the two coupled line sections with the same ratioρ (ρ >1) of even-\nand odd-mode characteristic impedance, and the electrical lengths of\nthe odd- and even-modes are equal. We can express the equations as\nfollowing:\nZte\nZto\n= Zse\nZso\n= ρ (1)\nZt =\n√\nZte · Zto (2)\nZs =\n√\nZse · Zso (3)\ncos φt = ρ − tan2 θt\nρ + tan2 θt\n(4)\ncos φs = ρ − tan2 θs\nρ + tan2 θs\n(5)\nThe impedance transformation ratio parameter of the source\nimpedance and the load impedance is deﬁned as:\nK = Z0\nZL\n= Zin\nZL\n(6)\nHere, the structures in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) are discussed\nrespectively.\n36 Wang et al.\n2.1. Stubbed Coupled Line Section Shunted at the Load\nIn Fig. 1(a), according to the transmission line theory, the input\nimpedance Zin of the two-section line is given by:\nZin = Zt\nZ′\nL + jZt tan φt\nZt + jZ′\nL tan φt\n(7)\nZ′\nL = jZs tan φsZL\njZs tan φs + ZL\n(8)\nApplying Equation (8) to (7) and separating the real and imaginary\nparts, we can obtain the following equations:\n{ jZinZtZs tan φs = jZtZsZL tan φs + jZ2\nt ZL tan φt\nZinZtZL − ZinZsZL tan φs tan φt = −Z2\nt Zs tan φs tan φt\n(9)\nEquation (9) can be rewritten as:\n\n\n\ntan φt\ntan φs = ZinZs−ZsZL\nZtZL\ntan φs tan φt = ZinZtZL\nZinZsZL−Z2\nt Zs\n(10)\nTo simplify the expression, letθt = θs = θ, thusφt = φs = φ, then we\nobtain: { 1 =ZinZs−ZsZL\nZtZL\nα ≡ tan2 φ = ZinZtZL\nZinZsZL−Z2\nt Zs\n(11)\nFinally, solving Equation (11), we obtained:\n\n\n\nZt =\n√\nZinZL − Zin(Zin−ZL)\nα\nZs = ZtZL\nZin−ZL\n(12)\nFor θt = θs = θ, thusφt = φs = φ, together to solve the Equations (4),\n(5) and (11): {\ntan2 θ = ρ1−cos φ\n1+cos φ\nα = tan2 φ\n(13)\nBy solving above equations forθ, we can obtain:\nθ = mπ ± arctan\n(√ρ tan\n(nπ ± arctan √α\n2\n))\n(14)\nwhere m, n are arbitrary integers, which means that there are four\nunrelated solutions. Since θ > 0 and we are interested in a small\ntransformer, we should pick the (+) sign in Equation (14) when\nm = n = 0 and pick the (−) sign in Equation (14) whenm = n = 1.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 141, 2013 37\nWithout loss of generality, we assume thatf1 < f2 < f3 < f4, and the\nfour fundamental solutions from Equation (14) are obtained as follows:\n\n\n\nθ1 = arctan\n(√ρ tan arctan √α\n2\n)\nθ2 = arctan\n(√ρ tan π−arctan √α\n2\n)\nθ3 = π − arctan\n(√ρ tan π−arctan √α\n2\n)\nθ4 = π − arctan\n(√ρ tan arctan √α\n2\n)\n(15)\nwhere 0< θ1 < θ2 < θ3 < θ4 < π, which means that the transformer\nproposed in this paper can provide perfect impedance matching at four\nfrequencies. Furthermore, we obtained the relationships from Equation\n(15) as following:\ntan θ1 tan θ2 = ρ (16)\ntan θ1\ntan θ2\n= tan2\n(arctan √α\n2\n)\n(17)\nθ1 + θ4 = θ2 + θ3 = π (18)\nApplying the electrical length deﬁnition, we obtain\nθi = βil0 = 2πfi\nc l0 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) (19)\nwhere c is the velocity of light,l0 is physical length of the single coupled\nline.\nFrom Equations (18) and (19), we obtain a frequency variablef0\nas follow:\nf0 ≡ f1 + f4\n2 = f2 + f3\n2 = c\n4l0\n(20)\nWith the frequenciesf1, f2, f3 known, the physical length of a single\ncoupled-line section can be calculated from Equation (20) by\nl0 = c\n4f0\n(21)\nAnd the electrical lengthsθi, ρ and α can be calculated by\nθi = βil0 = π\n2\nfi\nf0\n(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) (22)\nρ = tan\n(π\n2\nf1\nf0\n)\ntan\n(π\n2\nf2\nf0\n)\n(23)\nα = tan2\n(\n2 arctan\n√\ntan\n(π\n2\nf1\nf0\n)\n/ tan\n(π\n2\nf1\nf0\n))\n(24)\n38 Wang et al.\nThis completes the derivation of the design equations for the proposed\ntransformer of Fig. 1(a). Obviously, seen from the circuit conﬁguration\nshown in Fig. 1 and the above mentioned equations, the structure is\ncompact, and the procedure and the equations are rigid. If the values of\nf1, f2, f3 are known, ﬁrstlyf0 and l0 are obtained from Equations (20)\nand (21), and ρ and α are calculated from Equations (23) and\n(24). Secondly, the image impedancesZt and Zs are calculated from\nEquation (12), and thenZto, Zte, Zso and Zse are obtained according\nto Equations (1)–(3). Once above design parameters are obtained,\nthe tri-band transformer can be implemented on the special substrate\ndirectly.\n2.2. Stubbed Coupled Line Section Shunted at the Source\nThe design solutions with the stubbed coupled line section shunted at\nthe source as shown in Fig. 1(b) can be obtained similarly. According\nto the transmission line theory, the impedance matching condition for\nthe structure is given by:\nZin = jZs tan φsZin1\njZs tan φs + Zin1\n(25)\nZin1 = Zt\nZL + jZt tan φt\nZt + jZL tan φt\n(26)\nBy solving the equations similarly, the solutions is obtained as follows:\n\n\nZt =\n√\nZinZL − ZL(ZL−Zin)\nα\nZs = ZtZin\nZL−Zin\n(27)\nFor both these structures are the mirror of each other, the design\nprocedure is the same as the descriptions in Section 2.1. Furthermore,\nit can be seen that Z0 should be larger than ZL in solution\nEquation (12) and smaller thanZL in solution Equation (27), which\nmeans diﬀerent structures for diﬀerent cases.\n3. ANALYSIS AND NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\nThe above-mentioned solution is elementary in nature and in close\nform. However, it is necessary to consider the available ranges of\nfrequency ratios in application. Here, let f2 = pf1, f3 = qf2, and\nf3 = pqf1, where p, q is the frequency-ratio and 1< p <pq. Using\nthese in Equation (23) results in\nρ = tan π\np(q + 1)tan pπ\np(q + 1) (28)\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 141, 2013 39\nSince ρ >1, from Equation (25), we obtained\nsin π\np+pq\ncos π\np+pq\nsin pπ\np+pq\ncos pπ\np+pq\n> 1 (29)\nSince 1 < p < pq, we get cos π\np+pq > 0 and cos pπ\np+pq > 0. After some\nrearrangement and using trigonometric formula, the Equation (26) can\nbe derived as\ncos (p + 1)π\np + pq < 0 (30)\nThe solution of Equation (30) is given by\n2 − (4n + 1)p\n(4n + 3)p < q <2 + (1− 4n)p\n(4n + 1)p (31)\nwhere n is an arbitrary integer. Since 1< p <pq, in this limit, the\nEquation (31) can be reduced to\n1 < q <2 +p\np (32)\nWith this, we obtain\nf1 < f2 < f3 < 2f1 + f2 (33)\nFigures 2 and 3 show the relationships between the impedance\nratio ρ and frequency-ratio p, q, which clearly demonstrate that the\ndecrease rate ofρ is reducing with the increase ofp and q.\nFigure 2. Relationship between\nρ and frequency-ratiop.\nFigure 3. Relationship between\nρ and frequency-ratioq.\nAccording to the previous equations and analysis, some numerical\nexamples are demonstrated under condition thatK = 2. As illustrated\nin Table 1,f1 and f2 are ﬁxed at 1 GHz and 2 GHz withp = 2, andf3\n40 Wang et al.\nand ρ varied. Fig. 4 shows the theoretical return losses as a function\nof ρ for ﬁxedf1 and p = 2. We can ﬁnd that the return losses are well\nmatched at three design frequencies, and the bandwidth andρ reduce\nwith the increase ofq. Especially, whenp = 2 andq = 2,ρ equals 1.00.\nTable 1.Design parameters on conditionK = 2 andp = 2.\nf1 (GHz) f2 (GHz) f3 (GHz) p q ρ\nCase 1 1 2 2.7 2 1.35 3.31\nCase 2 1 2 3.0 2 1.5 2.24\nCase 3 1 2 3.3 2 1.65 1.66\nCase 4 1 2 4 2 2.00 1.00\nFigure 4.

Fig. 5 shows the theoretical return\nlosses as a function ofρ for ﬁxed f3 and q = 1.5. We can ﬁnd that\nthe return losses are well matched at three design frequencies, and the\nbandwidth andρ reduce with the increase ofp.\nFigure 6 shows theoretical return losses as a function ofK under\nthe condition that ﬁxedp = 2, q = 3 andρ = 1.66. It is shown that\nthe bandwidth decreases with the increase ofK.\n4. IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS\nTo certify the eﬀective impedance matching at three arbitrary\nfrequencies, a tri-band impedance transformer working at the\nfrequencies 0.9 GHz, 1.8 GHz, and 3.2 GHz has been fabricated,\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 141, 2013 41\nTable 2.Design parameters on conditionK = 2 andq = 1.5.\nf1 (GHz) f2 (GHz) f3 (GHz) p q ρ\nCase 1 3.2 4 6 1.25 1.5 3.31\nCase 2 2 4 6 2.00 1.5 2.24\nCase 3 1.6 4 6 2.50 1.5 1.66\nFigure 6. Theoretical return\nlosses as a function ofK for ﬁxed\np = 2,q = 3 andρ = 1.66.\nFigure 7.The model of tri-band\nimpedance transformer with the\ndimension being marked.\nwhich could be applied in GSM, PCS and Wi-MAX. The proposed\ntransformer is designed on Taconic TLX-6 PCB (tanδ = 0.0019)\nwith a dielectric constant of 2.65 and thicknessh = 1.0 mm. Here\nZ0 = 50 Ω andZL = 100 Ω are chosen. As shown in Fig. 7, based\non the real microstrip line, resistor and substrate, the model is built\nup with the dimension marked. The single section of coupled-line\nis replaced by stepped impedance coupled-line in model building to\novercome non-TEM behavior in microstrip realization. The numerical\nresults are calculated by Matlab 7.01, and the simulation results have\nbeen obtained by an EM simulation software Microwave Oﬃce 2004.\nWith the same process as that using above design procedure, we\ncan obtain Zte = 62.99 Ω,Zto = 46.70 Ω,Zse = 62.99 Ω andZso =\n46.70 Ω. Then the ﬁnal optimum dimensions are determined as follows:\nW0 = 2.73 mm,WL = 0.7 mm,Ws1 = 1.75 mm,Ls1 = 9.63 mm,\n42 Wang et al.\nFigure 8.Photograph of the fab-\nricated tri-band impedance trans-\nformer.\nFigure 9. Simulation and mea-\nsurement results ofS-parameters\nfor magnitude ofS11.\nWs2 = 2.58 mm,Ls2 = 8.59 mm,Gs = 0.68 mm,Wt1 = 1.75 mm,\nLt1 = 9.63 mm,Wt2 = 2.58 mm,Lt2 = 9.96 mm,Gt = 0.68 mm.\nA photograph of the fabricated impedance transformer is shown in\nFig. 8. The area of the proposed impedance transformer is 2.5×5.2 cm2.\nAll the measured data are collected from the Agilent N5230A\nnetwork analyzer. Fig. 9 demonstrates the measured and simulated\nresults of return-loss. The measured results of the return loss are about\n−25.7 dB at 0.9 GHz,−34.3 dB at 1.8 GHz, and−25.6 dB at 3.2 GHz,\nrespectively. It is seen that the measured results are in good agreement\nwith simulated ones for the load at the assigned frequencies. Some\nslight diﬀerences at higher frequency between measured and simulated\nresults may be due to serious parasitic eﬀects arisen from via holes,\nsoldering, and the limited precision of fabrication and measurement.\n5. CONCLUSION\nA novel tri-band impedance transformer is presented in this paper.\nBy using stubbed coupling line, the proposed transformer line can\nmatch a real impedance load at three uncorrelated frequencies and\ncan shorten the horizontal length. Two structures with two diﬀerent\nconﬁgurations of the proposed transformer have been given and\nanalyzed. Design equations are analytically derived, and the range of\nfrequency ratio is numerically deduced for the transformer parameters.\nThe numerical examples are evaluated to certify the feasibility of the\nproposed impedance transformer. In addition, a transformer operating\nat 0.9 GHz/1.8 GHz/3.2 GHz is fabricated and measured to verify the\nproposed structure, which may be applied in the present global system\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 141, 2013 43\nfor mobile communication (GSM), the personal communication system\n(PCS) and Wi-Max. The measured results show good agreements with\nthe simulated ones. The tri-band transformer could be widely applied\nin compact multi-band component including power dividers, couplers\nand antennas’ matching.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by the fundamental research funds for the\nCentral Universities (K50511020021) and the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China under Grant 61201298.\nREFERENCES\n1.
