Theoretical model refers to \nan energetic transformer with concentrated parameters  \nwith consideration of parameters of mutual inductance \nM.

The \ncomputer simulation confirmed the possibility of \ntransitional process analysis in transformer’s windings \nwith concentrated parameters. \n \nIndex Terms — Computer, Simulation, Transient \nProcess, Model, Transformer, Concentrated Parameters \n  \nI. Introduction \nTransformer’s load causes a change in voltage. This \nchange is usually manifested as a decrease (down) of \nvoltage relative to the idle. The transformer should be \ndesigned to withstand the possible tension throughout \nits life. This paper describes changes in the transformer \nduring load changes through computer simulations that \nindicate a failure or defect. \nComputer simulation today presents one of the \nleading methods for solving, describing, understanding \nand analysis of complex dynamic systems in the fields \nof technical sciences.  \nThe MATLAB software is designed for solving \nvarious mathematical and engineering problems Which \nwere modeled by the application of linear algebra and a \nmaster computer where this s imulation has been \nperformed, and that is why the simulation was \nperformed precisely in this software package.  \nMathematical model of power transformer is \ncompletely derived from the literature  [1], and is based \non the model derived in the software package  \nMATLAB and Simulink[7]. The simulation’s goal of the \nset theoretical models is to obtain relevant information \nabout the behavior of the power transformer in the \ntransition processes. \nIn the first example of a transformer of high power \nand a second example  of a transformer of low power it \nhas been shown that such a computer simulation in a \nqualitative way can describe the transient processes and \nby doing so a better analysis of their behavior can be \nperformed. \nThe remainder of this paper is organized  as follows:  \nSection 2 gives a  theoretical model of the transition \nprocess in the ideal and the real transformer with linear \nmagnetic characteristics. Section 3 describes dynamic \nchanges in real power transformer in MATLAB \nSimulink. It describes two simulations: Simulation 1- \nSimulates idling of transformer. Secondary current is \nequal to zero. Simulation was performed for the real \nthree-phase power transformer SIEMENS - ONAF / \nONAN.  \nSimulation 2- Simulates a short circuit and controls a \nsecondary current set to the rated current for the real \nthree-phase power transformer SIEMENS - ONAF. \nGraphs fluxes, current magnetization and voltages on \nthe primary and the secondary are given at the end of \nthe simulation process.  Conclusion and future work are \npresented in the final section.  \n \nII. Theoretical Model of Transient Process in \nTransformer  \nThe transformer consists of ferromagnetic circuit and \noperates as electromagnetic connection of two electric \nwindings: 1. primary is connected to the source of \nalternating current and 2. the secondary winding to \nwhich electric loading is connected. The task of the \nmagnetic circuits is to create spatial distribution of \n2 Computer Simulation of Theoretical Model of Electromagnetic Transient Processes in Power Transformers  \nCopyright © 2014 MECS                                            I.J.

Conclusion \nThe application of a computer simulation of dynamic \nbehavior of a power transformer in the software \nprogram MATLAB-SIMULINK at transient processes, \nthe validity of a given theoretical model in extreme \nregimes as idle operation has been confirmed.  \nMeasurement results a) in idle operation- time change \nof the flux verifies the value of expression (61) time \nflow of a current of magnetization verifies the value of \nexpression (59), and time flows of voltages of pri mary \nand secondary relations (47) and (48) at b) short circuit \ndiagram verifies the value, figure 5. \nIn the first example of  a transformer of high power \nand a second example of a transformer of low power it \nhas been shown that such a computer simulation in  a \nqualitative way can describe the transient processes and \nby doing so a better analysis of their behavior can be \nperformed. This paper described dynamic changes in \nreal and ideal power transformer through MATLAB \nSimulink, which indicates possible malfunction or \ndefect. \n \nReferences \n[1] B.
