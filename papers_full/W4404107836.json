  "abstract": "Background Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in general domains, they may output information in the medical field that could be incorrect, incomplete, or fabricated. They are also unable to answer personalized questions related to departments or individual patient health. Retrieval-augmented generation technology (RAG) can introduce external knowledge bases and utilize the retrieved information to generate answers or text, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. Method We introduced internal departmental data and 17 commonly used gastroenterology guidelines as a knowledge base. Based on RAG, we developed the Endo-chat medical chat application, which can answer patient questions related to gastrointestinal endoscopy. We then included 200 patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy, randomly divided into two groups of 100 each, for a questionnaire survey. A comparative evaluation was conducted between the traditional manual methods and Endo-chat. Results Compared to ChatGPT, Endo-chat can accurately and professionally answer relevant questions after matching the knowledge base. In terms of response efficiency, completeness, and patient satisfaction, Endo-chat outperformed manual methods significantly. There was no statistical difference in response accuracy between the two. Patients showed a preference for AI services and expressed support for the introduction of AI. All participating nurses in the survey believed that introducing AI could reduce nursing workload. Conclusion In clinical practice, Endo-chat can be used as a highly effective auxiliary tool for digestive endoscopic care.",
