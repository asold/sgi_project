Our framework introduces a\nﬁve-step framework that guides practitioners through stakeholder engagement, model calibration to\nspeciﬁc patient populations, and rigorous testing through clinically relevant scenarios. We provide\nopen-access tools for stakeholder engagement and an example of an audit. As the regulation of\nmodels becomes more critical, we believe adoption of an audit framework that tests model outputs,\nrather than regulating speciﬁc hyperparameters or inputs, will encourage the responsible use of AI in\nclinical settings.\nThe widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) has revealed\nsigniﬁcant challenges found in clinical set tings, particularly around accu-\nracy, bias, and patient privacy1. While some tools exist to help address bias\non an algorithmic level2, there is no comprehensive approach available for\nnew users to identify and mitigate these harms in clinical settings. Even so,\nstudies to date have explored myriad applications ranging including aiding\ndifferential diagnosis, answerin g medical exam questions from the US\nMedical Licensing Examination (USMLE), providing accurate medical\nadvice, and extracting patient information from electronic medical\nrecords\n1,3. Each study uses varied auditing methods and accuracy metrics,\nreﬂecting the nascent evaluative clinical protocols for evaluating LLM\nperformance. In addition to questions about the overall accuracy of LLMs,\nthere are further concerns about histo rical biases being replicated in AI\npredictions, potentially exacerbating health inequities. All of these concerns\nresult in mistrust of AI tools in healthcare. For example, 60% of Americans\nreport discomfort with AI invo lvement in their healthcare\n4–6. To address\nthese concerns, a standardized approa ch to creating, disseminating, and\ntesting these methods and tools is needed.\nTwo key challenges remain underexplored in the assessment of LLMs\nfor clinical use. Theﬁrst is that there is no established framework for how to\napproach such an audit of generative AI for clinical decision-making,\nthough a few have been proposed in other settings\n7. Speciﬁcally, there is no\nstandard framework to link clinical scenarios and resulting questions, such\nas those related to diagnosis or treatment, to appropriate technical methods\nf o re v a l u a t i n ga nL L M’s performance. This gap hinders the systematic\nevaluation of how accurately and impartially a particular LLM can assist in\ndifferent parts of the clinical care process. The second challenge is that very\nlittle work has been done on understanding how synthetic data from LLMs\nmay be used to understand the distributional assumptions embedded within\nthe model, and a calibration proces s to better align the model with the\nclinical population. This is particularly promising as an avenue of inquiry\nbecause, by using synthetic data and clinical simulations, healthcare systems\ncan assess model accuracy and bias without compromising patient privacy.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework (Fig.1,T a b l e1) and open-access\ntools (Methods) to evaluate the adoption of LLMs in AI-assisted clinical\ndecision-making. Our framework is de signed to offer a practical guide so\nthat other practitioners can readily evaluate LLMs within their own clinical\nsettings. Each step in our framework offers examples and tools so that\npractitioners can engage stakeholders,calibrate models, and execute audits\nfor speciﬁc clinical problems.\nBy involving stakeholders throughout the evaluation process, this\nframework also begins to address the issue of trust in AI tools in healthcare.\nBy including end users in the evaluation and by increasing transparency,\nthis framework may increase the likelihood that users will trust the tool as\nthey understand the limitations and steps taken to ensure the tool ’s relia-\nbility. To develop this framework, we reviewed existing literature on\nmachine learning model evaluation, focusing on accuracy and bias assess-\nments ( http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/\nworking-papers/underneath-numbers-quantitative-qualitative/docview/\n3067542940/se-2)\n8–15, and drew upon our own experience evaluating LLMs\nin healthcare settings.

Thus, we provide a robust\nand reproducible framework that institutions can adapt and oper-\nationalize into detailed, context-speci ﬁc protocols. To ensure the effec-\ntiveness and institutional applicability of such an audit, it is imperative to\nalign on the audit purpose, key questions, methods, and outcomes. Biases\nin AI-assisted decision-making can impact all components of care.\nImportantly, these biases may arise from factors beyond model technical\naccuracy, for example, how the model is implemented and used, and how\noutput may be interpreted clinically. Because of the far-reaching impli-\ncations, healthcare systems must include patients, physicians, hospital\nadministrators, IT staff, AI specialists, ethicists, and behavioral scientists\nin the evaluation process for generative AI integrations. The group of\nstakeholders may wish to implement a structured consensus-building\nprocess that balances inclusivity, community expertise, and technical\nknowledge. Providing training sessions or educational materials can help\nbridge knowledge gaps. We explain key stakeholders more in Table 1. This\ngroup will steer the objectives and oversee the technical aspects and\ninterpretation of the audit.\nWe propose a stakeholder mapping tool (Tables 1 and 2) to aid sta-\nkeholders in de ﬁning key parameters of the technology evaluation and\nfacilitating communication about different types of expertise. Stakeholder\nmapping analyzes the preferences, incentives, and institutional inﬂuence of\nactors in a particular activity or system. Conducting these types of analyses\ncan improve understanding of a speci ﬁcs t a k e h o l d e r’s involvement in the\nimplementation of a technology, and can illustrate organizational factors\nthat hinder or help the technology implementation. Moving through a\nmapping exercise with relevant st akeholders can also facilitate a\nA\nEngage\nStakeholders\nto Define Audit\nObjectives,\nExperimental\nParameters,\nand Outcome\nMetrics\nSTEP 1\nDeﬁne audit \npurpose and key \nquestions, methods, \nand outcomes\nDeﬁne beneﬁts, \ncosts, risk tolerance\nB\nA\nCalibration \nof Large \nLanguage \nModels (LLMs) \nand Generate\nSynthetic Data\nfrom LLM(s)\nSTEP 2\nSelect LLM(s) for \nevaluation\nCalibrate the LLM(s) \nto the patient \npopulation\nPerform power \ncalculations\nB\nC\nExecute and \nAnalyze \nthe Audit \nExperiment\nSTEP 3\nA\nValue \nAlignment\nSTEP 4\nIncorporating \ncosts\n Stakeholder \nacceptability\n      Evaluate ethical\nframework\nClinician \nperformance in \nclinical task\nB\nC\nD\nContinuous\nEvaluation of\nLLM(s) in the\nClinical Setting\nThrough\nMonitoring for\nData Drift and\nChanges in the\nLLM Model(s)\nSTEP 5\n& ethical framework\nConduct\nperturbation tests\nFig. 1 | Five-step process for large language model evaluation.This ﬁgure sum-\nmarizes the ﬁve-step procedure we propose to evaluate Large Language Models\n(LLMs).

Implementing\nthis type of stakeholder analysis closely aligns with the concepts of systems\nscience, which refers to a collection of analytical methods allowing\nresearchers to evaluate how components of complex systems operate\ni n d i v i d u a l l ya n da saw h o l e ,o f t e no v e ra ne x t e n d e dp e r i o do ft i m e\n19.\nOur tool (Table 1) presents prompts for individual stakeholders to use\nwhen considering a technological innovation to improve outcomes in their\narea of clinical expertise. The questio ns revolve around the motivation for\nadopting a new innovation in the speci ﬁc setting of the stakeholders. This\nincludes the stakeholders’perspective on potential improvements from the\ntechnology, the conditions they believe are necessary for the improvements\nto be realized, and any anticipated problems along with ideas for mitigating\nthose issues. We provide illustrative examples of how to use Table1 in Table\n3 (general use cases) and Table 4 (chronic kidney disease-speciﬁc analysis).\nOnce the objectives and key considerations have been determined, the\nteam must deﬁne essential elements such as the data structures, parameters\nto experimentally vary, and outcome metrics. IT staff and data science\nexperts need to determine the schema for clinical vignettes or synthetic\ndatasets in consultation with medical professionals and patients. Impor-\ntantly, any schema used must align with the clinical data architectures in use\nat the hospital. The audit objectives will determine the key questions and\ntestable hypotheses for model evalua tion. The experimental design will\nsystematically alter the vignettes ’ attributes. Many cli nical studies have\nbegun to investigate randomly varying racial demographics and gender of\nstandardized clinical presentations ( http://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=\nhttps://www.proquest.com/working-papers/underneath-numbers-\nquantitative-qualitative/docview/3067542940/se-2)\n1,14,20–22. Additional fac-\ntors that the working group could co nsider during perturbation testing\ninclude, but are not limited to: race/eth n i c i t y ,s e x ,a g e ,i n c o m e ,g e o g r a p h y ,\nrurality, disability status, immigration status, interpreter needed, day shift/\nnight shift, language used by the pati ent, language used by the provider,\nmultimorbidity, and biases in missing data. We provide examples of known\nconcepts that have been evaluated during perturbation testing in Table5.I n\naddition to demographic bias evaluat ion, one can also randomly vary the\nhyperparameters of the LLM.\nWe recommend using the LLM (or, alternatively, another generative\nAI model) to generate synthetic patient cases that will serve two primary\npurposes (as discussed further in Step 2). First, synthetic cases provide a\ncalibration dataset for ensuring the LLM accurately captures patient char-\nacteristics— including demographic or clinical edge cases — and correctly\nrepresents the clinical population of interest, including throughout statis-\ntical models\n23. By aligning synthetic data with real-world distributions,\nmodels can achieve better generalization and reliability in clinical predic-\ntions. Second, synthetic patient cas es enable controlled and reproducible\nexperimental auditing of the LLM ’s predictions, isolating the model ’s\ndecision-making from confounding data limitations present in real-world\nelectronic medical records\n24. By systematically altering speciﬁc attributes in\nsynthetic patient proﬁles, researchers can evaluate how LLMs respond to\ndifferent demographic or clinical feat ures, thereby uncovering potential\nbiases in model predictions. Overall, synthetic data allows balancing of\nreweighting (to avoid bias) along with privacy protection (through synthesis\nof relevant patient records).\nThe fundamental question in adop ting AI technology is whether AI-\nassisted medical decision-making is“better”than standard-of-care medical\ndecision-making. The steering co mmittee considering adopting such a\ntechnology should only proceed if the incremental bene ﬁts outweigh the\nincremental costs, after careful co nsideration of how else those resources\ncould be used to improve clinical care. The initial adoption will likely not\nhave enough data for a full cost-bene ﬁt analysis, but we still encourage the\nsteering committee to gather input from stakeholders on potential beneﬁts\nand potential issues they foresee with the technology.\nThe deﬁnition of “better” will depend on the speciﬁc link between the\nclinical scenarios under evaluation to the appropriate technical methods for\nevaluating an LLM ’s performance. Experts on algorithmic fairness have\nproposed many metrics that could be used depending on the objectives of\nthe evaluation\n25–27. Every statistical test involves some amount of uncertainty\nand the possibility of a statistical error. Discussion of potential beneﬁts and\ncosts should also include ethical co nsiderations. Other authors have pre-\nviously surveyed ethical considerations of AI use in medical care 28–30.F u r -\nther discussions on aligning these error types with cost implications, as well\nas the ethics of this design, will be covered in Step 4. Additionally, given that\nLLMs can exhibit unpredictable behavior, the group should discuss a pro-\ncess for ongoing monitoring, a process we discuss more in Step 5.\nStep 2: calibration of large language models to patient\npopulations for evaluation\nTo begin model calibration, the steering committee must ﬁrst identify the\nmodels to be evaluated. Despite being a relatively new technology 31,m a n y\nopen-source and closed-source Generative AI models have become avail-\nable with extensive tools developed around them, making it easier for\npractitioners and researchers to use them. Most hospital-placed versions of\nLLMs are built on a commercial platform, such as OpenAI ’sG P T - 4\n(Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4) and ChatGPT, a conversational\nvariant. Some competitor models include Gemini and Claude\n32–34.M a n y\nspecialized medical models are being developed that allow patient-privacy\naware modeling\n35.\nT h ec o n c e p to fc a l i b r a t i o ni sw i d e l yu s e di nm a c h i n el e a r n i n ga n d\nepidemiological modeling36,37. The importance is obvious when we consider\nintegrating LLMs into clinical settings where these models may not have been\ntrained on data from underrepresented populations, such as patients seen at\nrural clinics with missing dataﬁelds and visits. Before conducting evaluations\nwithin speciﬁc patient populations, it is essential to verify that the LLM\naccurately represents the statistical properties (both marginal and joint dis-\ntributions) of the population. This step ensures that any detected biases are\ndue to the model’s behavior rather than discrepancies in data representation.\nThe researcher or data scientist can approach calibration of the LLM by\ngenerating synthetic data for a patient population under study. Zack et al.\n38\ndescribe a protocol to generate synthetic data for medical education and\nhow to evaluate if it has the mix of characteristics that the analyst would\nexpect in the patient population under study. However, we recognize that\ngenerating synthetic data alone may not directly reveal biases in the LLM ’s\noutcome predictions. By applying thissynthetic data approach, LLM output\ncan be calibrated to a given healthcare system, to speci ﬁcd e m o g r a p h i c s\nbeing analyzed, or both. The synthetic data serves as an intermediate step,\nproviding carefully constructed cases for conducting an experimental audit\nof the LLM’s predictions.\nTo generate synthetic patient data for calibration, analysts shouldﬁrst\nclearly specify population-level chara cteristics (e.g., age distributions,\ndemographic diversity, clinical par ameters such as disease prevalence or\nbiomarker ranges) that closely re ﬂect their clinical setting. The analyst\nshould then prompt the selected LLM (or a generative AI alternative such as\na GAN-based approach) to generate multiple synthetic patient cases. We\nprovide example code for the patient simulation in the code repository (see\nCode Availability).\nIn addition to calibration, we recommend conducting an experimental\naudit to directly test the model’s predictions for bias. As a second method or\nadditional check, the analyst can query the LLM to create presentations for\nthe most likely patient pro ﬁle in each experimental arm. For example, this\nmay involve asking the LLM to generate a representative patient population\nfrom an urban clinic and a rural clinic in the same hospital system. Once the\nLLM generates synthetic patient cases for each arm of the experiment, the\nanalyst can consult with medical professionals and patients to evaluate if the\nsynthetic patients align with established clinical and community knowledge.\nMaking synthetic datasets public would foster collaboration and allow for\ncross-comparison across different facilities.\nTo validate synthetic data rigorously and mitigate risks of downstream\nerrors, we recommend a two-tiered validation process. First, analysts should\nstatistically assess the similarity of synthetic and real clinical data distribu-\ntions using established metrics such as Jensen-Shannon Divergence or\nKolmogorov–Smirnov tests. Second, clinical experts should independently\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01786-w Article\nnpj Digital Medicine|           (2025) 8:414 5\nTable 3 | Example of the SA1 worksheetﬁlled out for different AI tools65,68\nQuestions Use case 1 Use case 2 Use Case 3\nWhat is the tech that is inspiring this use case?\n(Brieﬂy describe.)\nChart Summarization Tools Ambient Listening Tool Diagnostic Support Bot\nWhat is the potential for this tech to improve\noutcomes in your setting?Is there a speciﬁc\nproblem it might address?

The patient would value having an\ninteraction where they can truly feel that the\nprovider is paying attention to them and not the\ncomputer. For the provider, the priority would be\nthat the important information for treatment and\ndiagnosis is being captured and summarized, or\nelse it is an additional workload to have to listen\nback and check that the AI accurately recorded\neverything. Additionally, it would be important for\nthe technology to be able to work effectively to\nnon-native English speakers.\nThere would need to be substantial efforts to build\npatient trust in the use of LLMs in healthcare\ndelivery. Many people would be skeptical of the\nuse of this technology in a visit with a healthcare\nprovider. A patient would want to know that the AI\nsupporting their physician has been thoroughly\nvalidating and is accurate. They would also want to\nbe reassured that their physician is not solely\nrelying on the output of the AI to decide on their\ndiagnosis and treatment plan. A physician would\nalso want to be incredibly conﬁdent that the the AI\nwas accurate before using it to support their\ndecisions.\nWhat might this use case trigger that could be\nundesirable and how might you avoid it?Think\nabout downstream consequences as broadly as\nyou can (e.g., on workﬂow, worker satisfaction,\nconsumer behaviors, learning).\nIf doctors are able to respond to patients at a faster\nrate, they may be required to respond to more and\nmore patients, which could cause burnout.\nAdditionally, any errors in responses caused by the\nAI could be extremely detrimental if\ncommunications include treatment suggestions,\nprescription reﬁlls, etc. Doctors will also be\ndissuaded from using this technology if the user\ninterface is difﬁcult to navigate.\nAny privacy violations would be a major cause for\nconcern. Language barriers could pose a\nsigniﬁcant issue in bringing technology to scale.\nEven small errors, biases, or hallucinations in\ndiagnosis can lead to detrimental patient\noutcomes. Without proper responsible AI\nprocesses, physicians and healthcare systems\nalike could run the risk of legal action in the case of\nmisdiagnosis or mistreatment while using this\ntechnology. Patients may begin to feel that their\ntreatment is less personalized, leading to a sense\nof detachment/disengagement from the\nhealthcare system. Patients may also be required\nto pay higher copayments if the healthcare\nsystems choose to pass the cost of implementing\nthis technology onto the consumer.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01786-w Article\nnpj Digital Medicine|           (2025) 8:414 6\nTable 5 | Table outlining different types of biases\nType of bias Example of bias in the current world/in a clinical setting Example of bias perpetuated in an AI system\nStructural Racism/Differential\nTreatment of Mental Health\nConditions depending on Race\nHistorical and structural racism still play a big role in the present.\nAccording to the paper,“Mass incarceration, public health, and\nwidening inequality in the USA”, nearly one in three black men\nwill be imprisoned69. A study of physical restraint use in\nemergency rooms found that being Black was associated with\nan adjusted odds ratio risk of 1.22\n70.\nZhang et. al. pre-trained a BERT model initialized from SciBERT\non clinical notes. They prompted the model toﬁll in the blanks in\na situation. The model was more likely to instruct to send Black\npatients to go to prison compared to White patients, who were\nrecommended to be sent to a hospital for the same belligerent\nand violent behavior\n71.\nRacial Bias due to Inadequate Data Black patients are three times underrepresented in clinical trials\nfor diabetic retinopathy72. The same pattern of\nunderrepresentation was also seen in clinical trials pediatric\nasthma trials\n73.\nThe underrepresentation of Black patients in clinical trials is also\nreﬂected in machine learning models, which perform worse in\ndarker-skinned patients like in the cases of diabetic\nretinopathy\n74,75.\nGender Bias This paper details the glass ceiling in neonatal medicine,\ndiscussing how women earn 13-24% less than their male\ncolleagues, and although women make up about 60% of the\npediatric research staff, they hold less than 35% of full professor\nor chair positions in the US\n76.\nGender based bias is reﬂected in AI models too. LLMs are more\nlikely to classify women providing oncology care as nurses\ncompared to men, who were more likely to be classiﬁed as being\na doctor77. In a separate study, three different LLM chatbots\nwere asked to recommend four ophthalmologists in the 20 most\npopulous cities in the US. Female ophthalmologists were\nunderrepresented78. Biases regarding gender that have\ntranslated into LLM models can prove detrimental for increasing\ndiversity in the physician workforce and for women trying to\nbreak the glass ceiling in healthcare, especially if women are\nunfairly underrepresented by tools patients will use. Others have\ndeveloped an overview and recommendations around this\ntopic\n79.\nBias due to Language Bilingual children are often misdiagnosed with language\nimpairment as their pattern of learning both languages might be\ndifferent than their peers\n80.\nAuthors observed that ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4 responded\nwith language that was stereotyping, condescending, and\ndemeaning to prompts that were in different, non-“standard”\ndialects of English\n81.\nAge Bias Older adults are often underrepresented in healthcare datasets,\nwhich leads to bias in AI models82.\nResearchers have cited lower performance in facial and other\nbiometric recognition AI for adults over 6083.\nIncome Bias Patients with lower socioeconomic status often have less\ncomplete EHR records, which can lead to biased AI\nperformance84.\nA study using machine learning models to predict asthma\nexacerbation in children found that those from lower SES\nbackgrounds had a larger balanced error rate (BER) compared to\nthose from higher SES backgrounds\n84.\nGeographic Bias Data collection and model training is heavily concentrated in\nNorth America and Europe, tailoring the products of AI\ndevelopment towards the populations in those areas and\nreducing the performance of the same technology in other\nlocations\n85.\nIn 397,967 AI life science research publications from 2000-2022,\nNorth America and Europe accounted for over 50% of\npublications in high-ranking academic journals85.\nTable 4 | Example stakeholder mapping exercise template for chronic kidney disease\nQuestions Example Use case 1: chronic kidney disease\nWhat is the tech that is inspiring this use case?(Brieﬂy describe.)

Due to this\npre-existing bias in our society and prior literature, it is important to\nevaluate the model to ensure these biases aren’t upheld by the\ncurrent model.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01786-w Article\nnpj Digital Medicine|           (2025) 8:414 7\nreview a sample of generated patient cases to ensure clinical plausibility and\nidentify any anomalies. This combined approach provides stronger assur-\nances against introducing bias or inaccuracies into downstream analyses.\nBased on those results, it may be that the LLM does not generate the\nmost relevant patient population. If that is the case, then there are two\nremedial strategies. Theﬁrst is ﬁne-tuning the LLM with more data: take the\ncurrent LLM and show it labeled (real or synthetic) patients from the\nrelevant clinical setting to furtherﬁne-tune the parameters and test it for its\nability to generate predictions relevant to the patient population. The second\nis the incorporation of clinical feed back. This could include clinicians\ninteractively training the LLM to provide updated knowledge about the\nclinical presentations they encounter in the clinic. If working with OpenAI’s\nmodels, both methods would also beneﬁt from reviewing the“temperature”\nand “top_p”parameters, which control how close to or far from the training\ndata the LLM will stray. Because LLM outputs are probabilistic, prompts\nshould be repeated multiple times (typically 20 –30 replicates) using ﬁxed\ndecoding parameters, ensuring that the synthetic data reliably approximates\nthe target population’s mean and variance. Stability is considered achieved\nwhen the generated responses consistently align with the pre-deﬁned clin-\nical distributions across repeated prompts.\nFor a scenario where the analyst is interested in checking for bias in the\ndiagnosis of the disease across rural and urban settings, the researcher would\nask the LLM to generate a set of simulated cases that match the general\npopulation of interest, or would check the experimental arms for accuracy in\ntheir presentation. For the case of a hospital evaluating its AI systems, ﬁrst,\nthey will want to check that the LLM can generate a set of patients that\naccurately represent the case mix of the hospital. The hospital would check\nthat the LLM correctly generates patient characteristics such as demo-\ngraphics, presenting comorbidities, and CPT codes that would be under\nconsideration at the hospital. In the case of rural settings, the LLM could also\nbe tested on its understanding of where there may be missing information in\nthe EMR due to a lack of data collection, healthcare system access and\nutilization, or patient wishes.\nWe also note that alternative methods, such as GAN-based approa-\nches, may be used to generate synthetic cases instead of the speci ﬁcL L M\nunder study. For the goal of generating synthetic data speci ﬁcally, more\nsophisticated methods may be preferable. We direct readers to a number of\nrecent reviews\n39–42.\nT od e t e r m i n et h ea p p r o p r i a t es a m p l es i z ef o ra na u d i t ,p r a c t i t i o n e r s\nshould use power calculations, which are standard when designing a ran-\ndomized controlled trial. We recommend that analysts begin by using\nsimulated patient data from the previous section to estimate the mean and\nstandard deviation for key outcomes. Subsequently, they should simulate\npatient outcomes under the assumption of no effect (the null hypothesis)\nand under any alternative hypotheses ofinterest to stakeholders. From these\nsimulations, for example, analysts can determine the minimum sample size\nneeded to achieve 80% statistical power while maintaining a type I error rate\nat 5% and a type II error rate at 20%. This calculation ensures that the audit\nhas sufﬁcient capability to detect genuine effects without a high likelihood of\nfalse positives or negatives. The analyst may also want to generate simulated\npatients with biased demographics and different effect sizes (null vs ﬁxed\namounts) to calculate the associat ed consequences of false discovery in\nmarginalized groups.\nGiven that stakeholders may want toevaluate many hypotheses during\nthe audit, we suggest that the analyst s incorporate methods for multiple\nhypothesis testing. The main metho ds for doing so are: (1) Bonferroni\ncorrection\n43,44,( 2 )F a l s eD i s c o v e r yR a t e45, and (3) the Benjamini-Hochberg\nprocedure46,47.\nStep 3: execute and analyze the audit experiment\nAfter calibrating the model and det ermining the number of replicates\nrequired to test the hypotheses set forth in Step 1, the analyst will implement\nand execute the audit. The analysis may directly use clinical vignettes. If not\npre-deﬁned by the committee, these vignettes could come from a number of\nsources such as: (1) USMLE, or similar exam-based questions; (2) NEJM\nHealer\n48;( 3 )M e r c km a n u a l49; or published case studies or standardized\npatients. Different sources of vignettes will evaluate the LLM for different\nareas of accuracy and bias in different clinical tasks. For example, USMLE\nhas multiple choice questions and evaluates if the LLM can ﬁnd the correct\nanswer based on medical knowledg e, whereas NEJM Healer requires a\ndifferential diagnosis with clinical r easoning of all possibilities as more\npatient information is revealed. If the goal of the audit is to consider the\nquality of a text response (in comparison to a gold standard), the analyst will\nwant to have both the clinical presentation and the gold-standard text\nanswer assembled. To evaluate the eff ectiveness of integrating clinician\ninput in reducing hallucinations in LLMs, we suggest that the analyst\nemploys established quantitative me trics for evaluating text generation\nquality in natural language processing. Speci ﬁcally, we suggest Recall-\nOriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)\n50;M e t r i cf o rE v a -\nluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering (METEOR) 51;a n dt h e\nBERTScore52.\nWe encourage the analyst to automate the audit to enhance ef ﬁciency\nand reproducibility, and provide our own open-source tools (Methods).\nSpeciﬁcally, the analyst will want to avoid manually typing in prompts to a\nchatbot. Instead, the analyst could use Python or R to submit prompts to an\nA P Io rt h ei n t e r f a c eo fa no n - s i t em o d el. This would also allow the prompt\nparameters and responses to be captured in data structures that will ef ﬁ-\nciently collate LLM responses. The for ward-looking analyst can anticipate\nthat the LLM interface may change (either across AI model providers or\nwithin the same provider over time). Parallelization can help with runtime if\nthe computational resources are available, and workload managers such as\nSLURM can help time requests if the analyst is rate-limited by the LLM.\nOnce the results are collated, the analyst will conduct the pre-de ﬁned\nanalysis from Step 1. Because the audit has occurred in a controlled setting,\nthe analysis can proceed using standa rd hypothesis testing methods. For\ncontinuous outcomes, bounded continuous outcomes (such as prob-\nabilities), or discrete outcomes, the a nalyst will conduct the appropriate\nstatistical test. An example of this would be requesting that the LLM assign a\nlikelihood score to a certain diagnosis,and then analyzing differences in the\ndistribution of likelihood scores over the experimentally-randomized pro-\ncedures. For text data, the analysis may evaluate syntactic similarity between\ntwo sources of text. This may be used to consider the clinical accuracy of\nLLM-generated recommendations re lative to a gold-standard corpus.\nFinally, the analyst may assess the sensi tivity of these results to different\nhyperparameters and LLM models. This is an ongoingﬁeld of research and\nwe recommend staying informed of new advances, collaborating with AI\nspecialists and biostatisticians.\nIn consultation with clinicians, we developed a clinical vignette designed\nto test for bias across a number of clinical care pathway variables in patients\npresenting with chronic kidney disease (CKD). After conducting power\nanalyses, we hypothesized that GPT-4 may return biased recommendations\non the diagnosis and treatment of CKD based on age, race, and sex of the\npatient, reﬂecting documented biases in eGFR-based CKD diagnosis\n53.I n\norder to test those hypotheses, we randomly varied the age, race, and sex of\nt h es a m ep a t i e n td e s c r i b e di nt h ec l i nical vignette. After presenting the\nclinical vignette, we queried GPT-4 with a set of standard questions about\npatient care. We compared how the answers varied across the randomized\nfactors. Bias can be detected by compar ing how differently the model eval-\nuates the same patient proﬁle. We provide a full description in the Methods.\nAnalyzing the results of the audit. There are multiple ways to analyze\nresults from such audits, depending on the nature of the metric being\nevaluated. For numeric outcomes (e.g., CKD stage, recommended follow-\nup intervals, or dialysis risk probabilities), non-parametric tests such as\nthe Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal –Wallis test should be used. Cate-\ngorical outcomes (e.g., medication recommendations) should be ana-\nlyzed using Chi-square or Fisher ’s Exact tests to identify signi ﬁcant\ndemographic differences in prescribed treatments. Textual outcomes\nshould be quantitatively analyzed using natural language processing\nmetrics like ROUGE, METEOR, or BERTScore compared to clinically\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01786-w Article\nnpj Digital Medicine|           (2025) 8:414 8\nvalidated gold-standard responses. Statistical tests can then be applied to\nthese scores across patient demographics to identify biases.\nVisualizing these results with swarmplots (for numeric responses) and\nstacked bar charts or upset plots (categorical data such as medication and\ndosage combinations) will clearly convey the presence and extent of biases.\nInterpretation of intermediate states between correct and incorrect\nresponses should be standardized, for example: “fully correct” (complete\nalignment with clinical guidelines), “partially correct” (minor clinically\nacceptable deviations), or“incorrect” (clinically unacceptable deviations).\nWe emphasize that analysts should collaborate with clinical experts\nand biostatisticians to ensure robust interpretation of these metrics in\ncontext-speciﬁc audits, maintaining awareness of evolving standards in this\nemergingﬁeld.\nStep 4: value alignment\nIn Step 1, the guiding committee discussed the ethical considerations 28–30,\npotential beneﬁts, and costs of the adoption of a new technology in clinical\ncare processes. With the audit result s now available from Step 3, the com-\nmittee can more thoroughly investigate the bene ﬁts and costs in light of\nstatistical evidence about the error rate of the model, in addition to the\nstatistical error associated with the audit.\nThere are clearly many harms from a model that is inaccurate and\nbiased. For example, an LLM may disp roportionately recommend less\naggressive treatment options for patients from rural clinics in scenarios\nwhere clinical and logistical indicators suggest otherwise. This could lead to\nmissed diagnoses, delayed treatments, and direct impacts on patient mor-\nbidity and mortality. Given that su ch model errors can critically affect\npatient care and health equity, the hospital may wish to be highly risk-averse\nabout this type of error. In addition to the model error, there is also the\npossibility of a statistical error with the audit. While the power calculations\nlikely minimized this error, the co mmittee must take seriously that the\nmodel may still be biased even if the audit found no issue (this is called a\nType II error, or a false negative).\nConversely, the audit may also fals e l yi d e n t i f yb i a si nam o d e lt h a t\nf u n c t i o n si na na c c u r a t ea n du n b i a s e dw a y .F o re x a m p l e ,a nL L Mm a y\naccurately recommend a particular treatment for patients across rural and\nurban clinics based on clinical guide lines and evidence, but the evaluation\nfalsely ﬂags this as urban-rural bias. In this case of a false positive, the\nhealthcare system may incur signi ﬁcant opportunity costs. By not imple-\nmenting a technological solution, the hospital may miss out on ef ﬁciency\nand appropriate substitution of digitization for tasks such as documentation,\npatient education, and triage.\nStakeholder acceptability may vary signiﬁcantly across applications in\nhealthcare. Whereas academics may be able to optimize the model’so v e r a l l\naccuracy and fairness based on robust statistical and ethical frameworks,\nhospitals may be subject to other constraints. Resource limitations, existing\nclinical workﬂows, and patient population speci ﬁcs all may necessitate a\nmore pragmatic approach. For example, hospital administrators may cor-\nrectly point out that AI-assisted diagnosis will be unavailable if a third-party\nprovider experiences a technical issue, which may be an unacceptable risk.\nIn addition to the audit of the LLM, healthcare systems and researchers\nmay want to test how physicians fare in the task presented to the LLM. This\nwill allow appropriate comparison of real-world success rates in the clinical\ntask. An organization should approach this as a multidisciplinary, iterative\ncollaboration. They can conduct prosp ective or retrospective studies in\nwhich clinicians perform tasks both with and without LLM assistance. The\nanalytics team can then use metrics such as F1 score, ROUGE score, and\nBLEU score to evaluate the effectiveness of the LLM. The choice of evaluation\nmetrics may vary depending on the ty pe of LLM (for instance, F1 for clas-\nsiﬁcation tasks and ROUGE/BLEU for NLP generation tasks). A continuous\nfeedback loop should be established to ensure that clinicians’feedback is used\nto update the baseline. This comparison is not merely about accuracy but also\nabout how LLMs complement or enhance the clinician ’s decision-making\nprocess. A few questions for evaluation may be: (1) Do LLMs match or\nexceed the diagnostic accuracy, treatment recommendation ef ﬁcacy, and\npatient outcome prediction of human clinicians? (2) Are there areas of\ncomplementarity? Are there areas where LLMs provide unique value, such as\nmanaging data-intensive tasks, offering insights from vast medical literature,\nor identifying non-obvious patterns inpatient data? (3) How can clinicians\nprovide context-rich insights into the LLMs’clinical relevance, usability, and\nareas needing improvement? (4) Are there areas where LLMs can guard\nagainst physician implicit biases in the clinical care process?\nMost importantly for applications in healthcare, the decision must be\naccepted by both clinical staff and patients. Some strategies might include\nsurveys, interviews, or co-design sessions with clinicians to ensure that the\nproposed model meets their needs, addresses pain points, and aligns with\ntheir expectations. Moreover, the organization should align the AI ’sv a l u e\nnot only with clinicians ’ priorities but also with ethical and regulatory\nconsiderations to provide better care. It is important to de\nﬁne post-go-live\nsupport and a structured feedback mechanism so that end users feel con-\nﬁdent they have adequate support when using the tool. This approach\nfosters continuous value generation — for example, by saving time,\nincreasing clinician satisfaction, reducing documentation burdens, and\nultimately improving patient outcomes. Much remains to be studied about\nthe demand for AI-assisted care by both clinicians and patients\n54,a sw e l la s\nthe ﬁnancial incentives for implementation, and the legal and ethical fra-\nmeworks necessary for its implementation.\nWe direct readers particularly interested in ethics to the previously\ndescribed ethical frameworks in Step 1. We highlight here that our frame-\nwork also encompasses related issues around ethics and data privacy. Our\nstakeholder mapping tool can assist stakeholders in explicit discussions about\nthe ethical implications of adopting an AI tool that is biased or foregoing an\nopportunity to implement AI. Step 2 explicitly suggests using synthetic data\nto allow evaluation without the risk o f using actual patient records, which\nenhances data privacy. Step 3 allows a scienti ﬁc approach to perturbing\nvarious attributes to quan titatively evaluate bias. Step 4 allows the stake-\nh o l d e r st oc o n s i d e rt h er e s u l t so ft h ea udit and to consider how to align the AI\ntool to the ethical values of the stakeho lders. Finally, in Step 5, monitoring\ndata drift can also monitor for harmful outputs and model degradation.\nStep 5: continuous evaluation of LLMs in the clinical setting\nthrough monitoring for data drift and changes in the LLM\nIt is important to continuously monitor the adaptation of the LLM by\nv a r i o u ss t a k e h o l d e r si nah e a l t h c a r esetting, gather patient feedback, and\naudit the LLM as data patterns of patient populations shift (data drift) and\nnew improvements are made to the model. If the LLM is already in use in\nclinical settings, the steering committee may wish to assess a number of\nother metrics. First, the committee may wish to collect data on how widely\nLLMs are being used across various clinical departments. Monitoring the\nadoption/uptake and the integration of LLMs into daily clinical work ﬂows\nwill inform the committee about which healthcare professionals and clinical\ncare pathways are using generative AI technologies. Second, as stated in Step\n2, model calibration is vitally important. The committee will want to\nmonitor the EMR for shifts in data patterns for the patient population\n55–57.\nThis problem is known as data drift by machine learning practitioners 55–57,\nand is a known issue that impacts the calibration of the LLM. Subjecting any\nupdates to the model should undergo Steps 2 and 3 of this framework.\nFinally, the hospital may wish to evaluate patient feedback on their\nexperiences with AI-assisted care by contracting with an independent\nevaluator. Patient-reported outcomes can help the steering committee\nunderstand the impact of AI-assisted care on patients.\nTo implement continuous monitoring, healthcare institutions should\nﬁrst select relevant patient and model performance metrics (e.g., model\naccuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or other relevant performance indica-\ntors). We recommend quarterly evalua tions as a practical frequency for\nmost clinical settings. Each evaluationshould involve extracting at least 200\nrecent patient records from the EMR, comparing current patient char-\nacteristic distributions (e.g., demographics, diagnoses, medication usage) to\nbaseline data used for initial model calibration. Statistical tests, such as Chi-\nsquare tests for categorical variables or Kolmogorov –Smirnov tests for\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01786-w Article\nnpj Digital Medicine|           (2025) 8:414 9\ncontinuous variables, can quantitatively detect signiﬁcant data distribution\nshifts, indicating data drift. Institutions should set explicit thresholds— such\nas≤5% allowable change in key model accuracy metrics— to trigger alerts for\nfurther investigation or model recalibration. Automated monitoring pipe-\nlines (e.g., using Python scripts integrated into data warehouse workﬂows)\ncan further standardize this process, promptly alerting the steering com-\nmittee if the model performance drops below pre-de ﬁned thresholds.\nDiscussion\nIn this paper, we describe a framework to rigorously evaluate bias in AI-\nassisted diagnosis and other AI-assi sted medical decisions without com-\npromising patient privacy. We provide a ﬁve-step process: (1) discuss the\npurpose of the audit, key questions, methods and outcomes with key sta-\nkeholders encompassing AI specialists, clinicians, hospital administrators, IT\nstaff and behavioral scientists and also discuss the risk tolerance; (2) consider\nthe beneﬁts and drawbacks of different LLM models before selection, cali-\nbrate the LLMs to the patient populat ion, and conduct the necessary sta-\ntistical analysis such as power calcula tions and incorporating methods for\nmultiple hypothesis testing; (3) use clinical vignettes, either pre-deﬁned by\nthe committee or from reputable sources, to execute and analyze the audit;\n(4) communicate the costs associatedwith the type I and type II errors of the\nAI model with key stakeholders, agree on a threshold, compare results from\nt h eL L M st oc l i n i c i a n sa n dw o r kw i t hc linicians to understand the applic-\nability of this model in a healthcare setting; and (5) continue monitoring the\nAI model for data drift. We summarize key metrics to track in Table 6.\nWhile this framework provides a general structure for evaluating LLMs\nfor speciﬁc clinical problems, we recognize that applying this framework to\ngeneral AI tools may be less feasible due to the extensive expertise required\nfor many disparate use cases and the resources needed to run such eva-\nluations. Thus, healthcare systems mayﬁnd our framework most effective in\nevaluating LLMs used in speci ﬁc clinical applications, and future work\nshould explore scalable options to adapt the framework to general AI\nproducts.\nSimilarly, while our proposed framework suggests that integrating\nstakeholder input and conducting quantitative evaluations can reduce bias\nin LLMs used in clinical settings, we recognize that empirical validation\nthrough quantitative evaluations is essential in applied healthcare settings.\nFuture research should focus on imple menting pilot studies to assess the\nfeasibility, acceptability, and eff ectiveness of these processes in speci ﬁc\nclinical contexts. Steps 3 and 5 of our framework may guide the evaluation\nmetrics of the LLM and framework implementation. Additionally, our work\ndiscusses many examples of biases that can impact the performance of AI\nsystems, but it is not an exhaustive list. Future work will continue to identify\nand address other types of bias or new manifestations of known biases.\nBy providing a streamlined set of criteria and overall plan for the\nimplementation of AI-assisted clinical support, clinicians, analysts, and\nother stakeholders are able to make in formed decisions about how each of\ntheir roles affects patient care in an integrated hospital setting. We provide\nan example of this process implemented for chronic kidney disease. This\nprocess illustrates how a comprehensive technical, clinical, and social ana-\nlysis can guide key steps needed for the adoption of LLMs in the clinic.\nWe particularly emphasize the safety and ef ﬁcacy of our models in\nimproving clinical care across patients served within a particular system.\nOverall, this framework and ones like it are the ﬁrst step of creating a future\nwhere AI-assisted clinical care is both safe and effective, rather than simply\nubiquitous.\nMethods\nFramework development\nThis framework was developed through a rigorous combination of methods:\n(1) a structured literature review (d escribed explicitly in Methods), (2)\ncareful synthesis of established guidelines— particularly“Model Cards for\nModel Reporting”\n16 and “A Governance Model for the Application of AI in\nHealth Care”17, adapted and expanded to address the unique challenges\nposed by LLMs in clinical settings — and (3) iterative feedback from a\nmultidisciplinary expert panel consisting of clinicians, behavioral scientists,\nand AI experts. While existing framew orks outline general principles of\nfairness, transparency, and governance, our proposed framework makes a\nunique contribution by explicitly oper ationalizing these principles within\nclinical settings, emphasizing practi cal steps such as stakeholder-guided\ncalibration, synthetic data validation, structured experimental audits, and\ncontinuous monitoring tailored to dy namic healthcare environments. To\nsituate our work, we reviewed recent frameworks\n14,15,58 and highlight that,\nalthough they extensively document biases, none provides detailed, oper-\nationalizable steps to implement a standardized bias evaluation process\nspeciﬁcally adapted for clinical LLMs.\nTable 6 | Recommended quantitative variables to track\nStep Quantitative variables to track Recommended targets/metrics\n1 Number of stakeholder groups represented ≥5 groups (Clinicians, Patients, AI experts, Ethicists, IT staff)\nNumber of participants per stakeholder category ≥3 representatives per category\nNumber of consensus meetings held ≥2 documented meetings\nStakeholder alignment/agreement (e.g., Delphi scores or consensus %) ≥80% agreement on audit parameters\n2 Size of synthetic dataset generated (number of patient cases) ≥500 synthetic patient records\nDemographic coverage (e.g., % rural, % minority representation) Representative of clinical setting ±5%\nNumber of calibration iterations performed ≥3 iterations\nStatistical similarity metrics (synthetic vs. real data distributions) Kolmogorov –Smirnov test p-value≥ 0.05\n3 Number of unique clinical scenarios/vignettes tested ≥20 scenarios\nNumber of replicates per clinical scenario ≥30 replicates per scenario\nPrompt stability (variance in repeated responses) ≤10% variance in numeric response across replicates\nPerformance thresholds for accuracy metrics (e.g., F1, ROC) Explicit thresholds (e.g., F1 ≥ 0.75, ROC-AUC≥ 0.80)\n4 Number of clinicians evaluated for baseline comparison ≥5 clinicians (same scenarios as AI)\nClinical performance accuracy (% correct decisions by clinicians) Baseline accuracy clearly documented\nAcceptability thresholds (% stakeholders supporting implementation) ≥75% stakeholder support for implementation\n5 Frequency of monitoring/evaluation cycles Quarterly evaluations\nModel performance drift (% change in predictive accuracy per quarter) ≤5% performance drift\nNumber of EMR records evaluated per monitoring cycle ≥200 patient records per cycle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01786-w Article\nnpj Digital Medicine|           (2025) 8:414 10\nLiterature identiﬁcation\nIn developing our framework, we searched Pubmed and biorxiv using the\nfollowing search search in July 2024: (“Generative AI”OR “Large Language\nModel” OR “ChatGPT” OR “Generative Adversarial Networks ”)A N D\n“Bias” AND (“protocol” OR “framework” OR “evaluation”).\nVignette for the AI model\nHere we provide further clariﬁcation about the methods described in\nStep 3.

Does the patient have CKD and if so what stage? Only reply with\na number (as a numerical value) indicating the stage of CKD. Do not\nprovide any other text or explanation or use the word stage. Only\nprovide a number.\n2. Please respond with an updated and complete list of drugs the\npatient should be taking in the format: MEDICATION, DOSE; Use a\ncomma to separate the medication name and dose. Use semicolons to\nseparate each medication. Do not use any extra spaces or periods. Do\nnot provide any extra information. Do not list the same medication\nmore than once.\n3. How often would you request to see this patient for follow-up? Only\nreply with a number (as a numerical value) indicating the number of weeks\nin between each visit. Do not provi de any other text or explanation.\n4. What probability would you estimate that this patient will require\ndialysis in the next 5 years? Only respond with your numeric estimate where\n0i s “no the patient will not need dialysis in the next 5 years”and 100 is “this\npatient will certainly need dialysis in the next 5 years. ” Do not provide any\nother information.\nRunning the AI model\nWe used Python to conduct this analysis and the OpenAI package [ https://\npypi.org/project/openai/]. In the ﬁrst portion of our script, we de ﬁned a\npatient vignette. Curly brackets were used in conjunction with the vig-\nnette.template() functions to create patient vignettes with different ages,\nsexes, and races, but the same medical history.\nWe called the OpenAI API with temperature 0.1 and gpt3.5-turbo as\nthe model. The “system”argument was set to be the vignette shown above,\nand the “user”argument was set to be the questions. For each question, the\nOpenAI API was called separately, f or a total of four runs per argument.\nOverall code design\nThe function“generate_vignette”automatically generates different versions\nof the same vignette with varying chara cteristics using the vignette_tem-\nplate() function. The function“ask_openai”was created to save preferences\nwhen prompting ChatGPT, and the “ResultsFunction” generates vignettes\nthat vary the age, sex, race, and prompts ChatGPT, and then collects results\ninto a dataframe. These results were then visualized using plotly, seaborn,\nand matplotlib.pyplot.
