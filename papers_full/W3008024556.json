    "abstract": "With the development of Industry 4.0, as a pivotal part of the power system, large-capacity power transformers are requiring fault diagnostic methods with higher intelligence, accuracy and anti-interference ability. Considering the powerful capability for extracting non-linear features and the sensitivity differences to features of deep learning methods, this paper proposes a deep parallel diagnostic method for transformer dissolved gas analysis (DGA). In view of the insufficient and imbalanced dataset of transformers, adaptive synthetic oversampling (ADASYN) was implemented to augment the fault dataset. Then, the newly constructed dataset was normalized and input into the LSTM-based diagnostic framework. Then, the dataset was converted into images as the input of the CNN-based diagnostic framework. At the same time, the problem of still insufficient data was compensated by the introduction of transfer learning technology. Finally, the diagnostic models were trained and tested respectively, and the Dempster–Shafer (DS) evidence theory was introduced to fuse the diagnostic confidence matrices of the two models to achieve deep parallel diagnosis. The results of the proposed deep parallel diagnostic method show that without complex feature extraction, the diagnostic accuracy rate could reach 96.9%. Even when the dataset was superimposed with 3% random noises, the rate only decreased by 0.62%.",
