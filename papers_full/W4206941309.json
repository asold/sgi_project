    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a novel model for facial micro-expression (FME) recognition. The proposed model basically comprises a transformer, which is recently used for computer vision and has never been used for FME recognition. A transformer requires a huge amount of data compared to a convolution neural network. Then, we use motion features, such as optical flow and late fusion to complement the lack of FME dataset. The proposed method was verified and evaluated using the SMIC and CASME II datasets. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 0.7447 and 73.17% in SMIC in terms of unweighted F1 score (UF1) and accuracy (Acc.), respectively, which are 0.31 and 1.8% higher than previous SOTA. Furthermore, UF1 of 0.7106 and Acc. of 70.68% were shown in the CASME II experiment, which are comparable with SOTA.",
