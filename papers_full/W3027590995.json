  "abstract": "Frequency response analysis (FRA) is regarded as the most effective technique to detect mechanical faults of transformers. Over the years, FRA measurement data have been collected by utilities into transformer asset databases. The characteristic of FRA data is fundamentally determined by the transformer's equivalent electrical circuit, which consists of inductance and capacitance parameters that are windings' design and structure dependent. Different winding types tend to have different FRA characteristics, and a transformer's design information such as winding type, dimension etc. is often not known to the utility but critically important for asset management. This study reviews the state‐of‐the‐art transformer FRA databases and application of machine learning techniques in this field, and proposes to apply a support vector machine (SVM) model onto the FRA data to identify the winding type. The SVM model is first trained by FRA traces of transformers with known winding types, and after testing, the SVM model is then applied to FRA traces with unknown winding information. A set of data from the UK's National Grid FRA database, was used to demonstrate and verify the SVM model. All transformers used in this study are 400/275/13 kV transmission transformers, which were designed using four different winding types, namely multiple layer, plain disc, interleaved disc and single helical windings. The proposed method can successfully identify the correct winding type.",
