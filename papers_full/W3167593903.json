INTRODUCTION\nHigh voltage power transformers are mainly required for the\nassociated heavy and powerful applications in an industrial\nenvironment. These transformers use particular insulation\nsystems that depend primarily on the voltage levels. Indeed,\nthe higher the voltage, the greater the impact on the trans-\nformer’s lifetime and reliability [1]. Otherwise, the trans-\nformer insulation systems may deteriorate when exposed to\nnumerous defects arising from overheating, paper carboniza-\ntion, arcing, and discharges of low or high energy [2]. There-\nfore, early-stage detection of faults should be conducted to\nensure an efﬁcient service of these transformer [3], [4]. For\nthis purpose, several methods were proposed in the litera-\nture. Among them, Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) represents\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Baoping Cai\n .\none of the fastest, economical, and widely used techniques\nreferring to those related to the dielectric insulation sys-\ntems [5], [6]. Hydrogen (H 2), Methane (CH 4), Acetylene\n(C2H2), Ethylene (C2H4), and Ethane (C2H6) might be gener-\nated within the oil during a faulty mode [7]. Hence, the power\ntransformer’s abnormal state can be identiﬁed by the DGA\nmethod according to the dissolved gases composition and\ncontent. The concentrations of these gases are associated with\nsix basic electrical and thermal faults, which might occur\nseparately or in a combination [1], [8].\nBased on DGA, different approaches have been developed\nto diagnose the multiple transformer faults and quantita-\ntively indicate each fault’s likelihood. These approaches are\nmainly based on (i) graphical (e.g., [2], [9]), (ii) artiﬁ-\ncial intelligence techniques (e.g., [10], [11]), and (iii) other\nimproved coupled techniques (e.g., [12]). Overall, the analy-\nsis is generally based on the concentration of the ﬁve principal\nVOLUME 9, 2021 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Kherifet al.: Accuracy Improvement of Power Transformer Faults Diagnostic Using KNN Classifier\nhydrocarbon gases where the said concentration is used\ndirectly in ppm or percentages to the total sum. Likewise,\nvarious methods are based on a combination of ratios of some\nspeciﬁc gases. For instance, three-gas ratios (C 2H2/C2H4,\nCH4/H2, and C 2H4/C2H6) are used in Roger’s method [6]\nand IEC 60599 [8], three relative percentages in Duval’s\ntriangle (%CH4, %C2H2 and %C2H4) [2], and four-gas ratios\n(CH4/H2, C 2H2/CH4, C 2H4/C2H6, and C 2H2/CH4) in Dor-\nnenburg method [1]. Such techniques are mostly required\nfor the associated heavy and powerful applications. These\ntechniques and other ones (e.g., [13], [14]) are presented in\nthe literature to identify the different kinds of faults occurring\nin operating transformers. However, their diagnostic accuracy\nrequires further improvement. In this light, Duval’s pentagon\nhas been developed as a complementary tool for interpreting\nthe DGA in power transformers [9].\nFor this technique, ﬁve relative percentages of the (ﬁve)\nleading hydrocarbon gases (%H 2, %CH 4, %C 2H2, %C 2H4,\nand %C 2H6) are used. In the same context, probabilistic\nclassiﬁers based on Parzen Windows, Bayesian and Mexican\nhat functions (e.g., [15], [16]) have been employed for trans-\nformers fault classiﬁcation using actual DGA data. More-\nover, various artiﬁcial intelligence techniques have been also\napplied for the transformer fault diagnosis, such as a fuzzy\nlogic technique [17]. On the other hand, bootstrap and genetic\nprogramming have been developed to extract classiﬁcation\nfeatures for each fault class. These extracted features have\nbeen employed as the inputs to an artiﬁcial neural network\n(ANN), a support vector machine (SVM), or a K-Nearest\nNeighbor (KNN) classiﬁer to perform multicategory fault\nclassiﬁcation [18]. Also, combined Duval pentagon with\nSVM and KNN algorithms have been proposed to improve\nthe fault diagnostic accuracy [7]. It is worth noting that\nthe KNN algorithm was ﬁrst suggested by Cover and Hart\nin 1967 [19]. This algorithm has encountered several recent\nimprovements (e.g., [20]–[23]).\nOverall, the originality of this work consists in introducing\nseveral input vectors into the KNN classiﬁcation algorithm\nbased on a decision tree principle (DT) in order to select\nthe best one that achieves high accuracy for the transformer\nfaults diagnostic. Various types and combinations of input\nvectors have been employed, namely, the concentration of\ngas in ppm, relative concentration of gas in percentage, IEC\nratios, Rogers four-ratios, Dornenburg ratios, Duval triangle\ncoordinates, Duval pentagon coordinates, a combination of\nRogers and Dornenburg ratios, and the combination of Duval\ntriangle-pentagon coordinates. The accuracy rate has been\nanalyzed to select the most appropriate input vector for the\nproposed method.\nThe current paper is organized as follows: In Section 2,\nwe formulate the faults classiﬁcation problem in power trans-\nformers and describe the database set used in this inves-\ntigation. A general description of the KNN technique’s\ntheory is introduced in Section 3, including the basic theory\nof the KNN technique. In Section 4, the interpretative\nmethods based on DGA are reported. The selection of an\nappropriate input feature for each classiﬁcation layer and the\nproposed combined KNN classiﬁer’s performance with the\ndecision tree rule are accomplished in Section 5 to demon-\nstrate the proposed method effectiveness. Finally, conclusions\nare summarized, and potential future works are discussed in\nSection 6.\nII. PROBLEM FORMULATION\nHighly reliable transformers are mainly made of iron core\nand windings. Both components are placed in a tank ﬁlled\nwith insulating oil. Figure 1 shows a cross-section of a typical\noil-immersed power transformer.\nFIGURE 1. Representation of oil-immersed power transformer\ncross-section.\nDissolved gases, that are liberated under particular\nelectrical or thermal constraints, represent a powerful feature\nindicating the affection of oil properties. In general, the most\nimportant gases are H 2, CH 4, C 2H2, C 2H4, and C 2H6. The\nconcentration of these gases is strongly related to the type of\ntransformer fault, and the rate of gas generation can be used\nto identify the fault type [24]. For instance, acetylene is asso-\nciated with arcs where temperatures reach several thousand\ndegrees. Ethylene is related to hotspots between 150 ◦C and\n1000 ◦C, and hydrogen with cold gas plasma from corona\ndischarges. Although mixtures of all gases, including other\nsaturated hydrocarbons, are generally obtained in most cases\nof faults where their relative proportions have been correlated\nwith the different fault types [25].\nOil samples in small volumes are periodically taken from\nthe drain valve at the bottom of the transformer tank for the\nDGA test using chromatography as described in [25], [26].\nThe most common defects are partial discharge (PD), low\nenergy discharges (D1), high energy discharges (D2), thermal\nfaults <300 ◦C (T1), thermal faults of 300 ◦C to 700 ◦C (T2),\nand thermal faults >700 ◦C (T3) [7].\nA database set of 501 samples is used to train, test, and\nvalidate the proposed classiﬁer in the present investigation.\nThis database is collected from the literature [4], [28]–[31].\n81694 VOLUME 9, 2021\nO. Kherifet al.: Accuracy Improvement of Power Transformer Faults Diagnostic Using KNN Classifier\nTABLE 1. Database distribution.\nThe fault type samples distribution (number of samples asso-\nciated with each defect) is explained in Table 1.\nIII. K NEAREST NEIGHBORS CLASSIFIER (KNN)\nKNN algorithms are ranked among the simplest intelligent\nalgorithms that do not require any learning phase. It is based\non calculating the distances between the sampling points to\nthe nearest neighbors of the set of assigned points [19]. The\ndecision is based on the majority vote of the KNN. Many\ntypes of distances can be used to decide the nearest neighbors,\nsuch as Gaussian, triangular, cosine ... etc. [10].\nFigure 2 illustrates the principle as well as the inﬂuence\nof the choice of neighbors number. The three closest star\nneighbors selection allows the star classiﬁcation as a square\n(objects inside the small circle in a continuous line). However,\nthe star is classiﬁed as a triangle if we consider ﬁve closest\nneighbors (items inside the large ring in discontinuous line).\nIndeed, the choice of the neighbor’s number k is a leading\nfactor during the classiﬁcation process.\nFIGURE 2. Influence of the number of neighbors on the classification\nresults (reproduced from [7]).\nA. 1-NN ALGORITHM (KNN WITH K= 1)\nWe consider L the data set of awarded points given by :\nL :{(yi,xi),i =1,..., n}\nwhere yi ∈{1,..., c} denotes the class of sample i and\nthe vector xi =(xi1,..., xip) represents the variables that\ncharacterize the sample i.\nThe distance function d(.,.) determines the nearest neigh-\nbor. P variables characterize the Euclidean distance between\na sample xi and an attributed point x j and is deﬁned by :\nd((xi1,xi2,..., xip),(xj1,xj2,..., xjp))\n=\n√\n(xi1 −xj1)2 +(xi2 −xj2)2 +... +(xip −xjp)2 (1)\nThe observation of the sample ( y, x) by the nearest neigh-\nbor (y(1), x(1)) in the learning sample is determined by :\nd(xi,xj) =minj(d(xi,xj)) (2)\nWe designate by ˆy =y(i) the estimated class of the nearest\nneighbor. This class is selected for the prediction of y.\nConsidering the Minkowski formula of equation (3),\nthe Euclidian distance is obtained by replacing p by 2 and\nis given by equation (4)\nd(xi,xj) =\n( p∑\ns=1\n⏐⏐xis −xjs\n⏐⏐p\n)1\np\n(3)\nd(xi,xj) =\n( p∑\ns=1\n(xis −xjs)2\n)1\n2\n(4)\nB. KNN ALGORITHM\nIn applications, several closer neighbors are usually\nemployed. The decision favors the classes majority repre-\nsented by the k neighbors obtained from equation 5, k r being\nthe number of observations from the group of closest neigh-\nbors belonging to class r and ‘‘ c’’ the number of classes.\nc∑\nr=1\nkr =k (5)\nThe observation is predicted in class l, only if l =max (kr)\nwith k ∈N.\nIt is recommended to choose the odd k, o avoid equal votes\nin the binary classiﬁcation. However, in the case of multi-\nclasses, the best choice of k depends on the nature of the\ndata. The noise effect on classiﬁcation (risk of overlearning)\nis reduced when k takes large values. However, this choice\nmakes the boundaries between classes less distinct. The best\nselection of k is the one that minimizes the classiﬁcation\nerror [27].\nC. KERNEL FUNCTION\nThe classiﬁcation is inﬂuenced by parameter k and the type\nof the kernel function K(x). The K function must check the\nfollowing properties:\nVOLUME 9, 2021 81695\nO. Kherifet al.: Accuracy Improvement of Power Transformer Faults Diagnostic Using KNN Classifier\n- K(d) ≥0 for all d ∈ℜ;\n- K(d) reaches its maximum for d =0;\n- K(d) decreasing for d →±∞.\nSeveral kernel functions [27] are rectangular\n(uniform law), triangular, Epanechnikov, cosine, Gaussian,\nand reverse.\nD. KNN ALGORITHM ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES\nThis technique is easy to implement and apply to any data,\nincluding complex ones such as geographic information, text,\nimages, and sound. Also, it is robust to noise. The intro-\nduction of new data does not require the reconstruction of a\nmodel. The class is assigned to an object with ease and clarity\nonce the closest neighbors are displayed.\nAs mentioned, the method performance depends on the\ndistance type, and the number of neighbors, and how the\nneighbors’ responses are combined. The results could be\nof poor quality if the number of relevant attributes is low\nrelative to the total number of characteristics. The distances\non the irrelevant attributes will drown out the proximity\non the appropriate attributes. The calculations made in the\nclassiﬁcation phase can be very time-consuming.\nIV. DGA–BASED INPUT VECTOR\nMany interpretative methods based on DGA were reported\nin the literature to detect the incipient fault nature within an\noil-immersed power transformer [7], [10]. These techniques\nmainly include the following input vectors:\n• Vector 1:Since the database contains the concentrations\nof the ﬁve gases in parts per million or ppm, each\nsample X is represented as follows:\nX =[H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6] (6)\n• Vector 2:Since the weight percent of the gases would\nresult in an inopportunely small number, percent con-\ncentration to the total sum is also used where each\nsample X =[x1, x2, ···, x5] is scaled as follows:\nX ← X\n5∑\ni=1\nxi\n×100%\nX =[%H2, %CH4, %C2H2, %C2H4, %C2H6] (7)\n• Vector 3:The IEC Ratios method is used to produce\nthe following input vector containing three ratios of the\ndissolved gases given by:\nX =[CH4\nH2\n,C2H2\nC2H4\n, C2H4\nC2H6\n] (8)\n• Vector 4:Roger’s four-ratio method has been selected\nin this case to transform each sample to the following\none:\nX =[CH4\nH2\n,C2H2\nC2H4\n, C2H4\nC2H6\n,C2H6\nCH4\n] (9)\n• Vector 5:Dornenburg’s method is also investigated in\nthis study. In this method, the input consists of four ratios\ncomputed as a function of the dissolved gases in ppm as\nfollows:\nX =[CH4\nH2\n,C2H2\nC2H4\n, C2H4\nC2H6\n,C2H2\nCH4\n] (10)\n• Vector 6:Duval triangle is a graphical method that use\nonly the concentration of three gases (CH 4, C 2H2, and\nC2H4) to produce the input vector as follows:\nX =[Cx ,Cy] (11)\nwhere the components Cx and Cy are computed by :\nCx =1\n3\nn−1∑\ni=0\n(xi +xi+1)(xiyi+1 −xi+1yi)\nn−1∑\ni=0\n(xiyi+1 −xi+1yi)\n(12)\nAnd\nCy =1\n3\nn−1∑\ni=0\n(yi +yi+1)(yixi+1 −yi+1xi)\nn−1∑\ni=0\n(yixi+1 −yi+1xi)\n(13)\nThe parameters xi are deﬁned as follows :\nx0 =%CH4 cos(π\n2 )\nx1 =%C2H4 cos(π\n2 +α)\nx2 =%C2H2 cos(π\n2 +2α) (14)\nThe parameters yi can be found by replacing the cosine\nwith the sine in the previous expressions with α=2π3.\n• Vector 7:The input vector, in this case, has two compo-\nnents given as follows:\nX =[Cx ,Cy] (15)\nX is computed according to the Duval pentagon that uses\nthe concentration of ﬁve gases in percentages. The compo-\nnents Cx and Cy are calculated by :\nCx =1\n6\nn−1∑\ni=0\n(xi +xi+1)(xiyi+1 −xi+1yi)\nn−1∑\ni=0\n(xiyi+1 −xi+1yi)\n(16)\nAnd\nCy =1\n6\nn−1∑\ni=0\n(yi +yi+1)(yixi+1 −yi+1xi)\nn−1∑\ni=0\n(yixi+1 −yi+1xi)\n(17)\nwhere the parameters xi are deﬁned as follows :\nx0 =%H2 cos(π\n2 )\nx1 =%C2H6 cos(π\n2 +α)\n81696 VOLUME 9, 2021\nO. Kherifet al.: Accuracy Improvement of Power Transformer Faults Diagnostic Using KNN Classifier\nx2 =%CH4 cos(π\n2 +2α)\nx3 =%C2H4 cos(π\n2 +3α)\nx4 =C2H4 cos(π\n2 +4α) (18)\nThe parameters yi can be found by replacing the cosine\nwith the sine in the previous expressions with α=2π5.\nOther possible combinations of the above technique have\nalso been proposed to give strong credibility to the obtained\nresults. Two combinations are given below.\n• Vector 8: The ﬁrst combination consists of an input\nvector of ﬁve ratios given by:\nX =[CH4\nH2\n,C2H2\nC2H4\n, C2H4\nC2H6\n,C2H2\nCH4\n,C2H6\nCH4\n] (19)\nEquation (14) refers to the mixture of Roger’s and Dornen-\nburg’s methods.\n• Vector 9:The input vector, in this case, has four com-\nponents given as follows:\nX =[Cx1,Cy1,Cx2,Cy2] (20)\nAccording to Duval’s triangle and pentagon, this vector\nhas computed that use the concentration of ﬁve gases in\npercentages. Cx1 and Cy1 are calculated according to the\ntriangle method, while Cx2 and Cy2 employ the pentagon\ntechnique.\nV. SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS\nThe database of 501 samples, already used to evaluate the\nKNN classiﬁer’s accuracy rate, has been also employed in\nthis section. Randomly selected, 321 samples have been\nutilized for the training phase,160 samples for the testing\nphase, and 20 samples to examine the validity of the proposed\nclassiﬁer. Each previous vector has been used independently\nas an input of a KNN classiﬁer. Several types of distance have\nbeen used, namely ‘‘Euclidean’’, ‘‘Cityblock’’, ‘‘Cosine’’,\nand ‘‘Correlation’’. For the training phase, the number of\nneighbors k has been varied from 1 to 321 where the value\ncorresponding to the better accuracy rate is maintained. This\nprocedure has been repeated for the nine types of the previ-\nously deﬁned input vectors. Figure 3 shows an example of\nthe classiﬁcation results obtained when using the ﬁrst input\nvector (gases in ppm).\nFrom the obtained results in Figure 3, an accuracy rate\nof 88.75% has been developed for both distances ‘‘Correla-\ntion’’ and ‘‘Cosine’’ with the same neighbors number k =6.\nWhereas, an accuracy rate of 77.50% (respectively 76.25%) is\nobtained for ‘‘Cityblock’’ (respectively Euclidean) achieved\nfor a distance k =8 (respectively k =4).\nFor several neighbors and distance types, all input vectors\nhave been separately tested. Based on the obtained results,\nthe best classiﬁcation accuracy rate is selected for each input\nvector. Figure 4 regroups the best nine classiﬁcation results.\nFrom this ﬁgure, it is clear that the accuracy rate is affected\nby both the type and the number of the neighbors. Higher\nFIGURE 3. Impact of input vector ‘‘type 1’’ and number of neighbors on\nthe classification performance (accuracy rate).\nFIGURE 4. Performance of KNN classifier as function of the number of\nneighbors for different input vectors.\naccuracies are obtained for a relatively low number of neigh-\nbors, tending toward a plateau of about 28%. In order to\nquantify the results of Figure 4, the best accuracy rate over the\nnumber of the neighbors is subtracted for each input vector.\nThe obtained results are given by Table 2.\nAs shown in Table 2, it is found that the highest accu-\nracy rate, of 91.88%, is obtained when employing vector 2\n(gas in percentage) as an input of the KNN with Cityblock\ndistance and k =10. Furthermore, the combined triangle and\npentagon coordinates (vector 9, using Cityblock distance and\nk = 6) came in second place with an accuracy rate\nof 90.63%. Finally, the combined Roger’s and Dornen-\nburg’ gave the poorest results (29.88%) compared to the\nothers.\nAs stated in the introduction, the novelty of this\ninvestigation is to examine several types of input vector, in the\nVOLUME 9, 2021 81697\nO.

The accuracy rate of the validation phase.\nthe best number of neighbors k and the selected distance types\nwere employed in the following study.\nElaborating the whole of the previous input vectors,\nan analysis has been made to compute the accuracy rate\nat each node. Table 3 illustrates a detailed analysis of the\naccuracy rate leading to selecting the more appropriate input\nvector and neighbor number for each node.\n81698 VOLUME 9, 2021\nO. Kherifet al.: Accuracy Improvement of Power Transformer Faults Diagnostic Using KNN Classifier\nTABLE 6. Comparison between the proposed algorithm and other traditional methods.\nFrom these results, one can clearly see that the input\nvectors 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9 separate the electrical and thermal\nfaults with the same accuracy rate of 98.75%. Indeed, both\nnodes of electrical faults are suitable with the input vector\nin ppm. Regarding the thermal faults node, the ﬁrst node\n(T3 vs. T1&T2) is more compatible with both input vectors,\nin percentage, and the combined Duval triangle and pen-\ntagon. The accuracy rate in this stage reaches 93.24%. The\nsecond thermal node is consistent with the combined Duval\ntriangle and pentagon input vector, with an accuracy rate\nof 91.67%.\nBased on the results of Table 3 as well as the accuracy rate\nby nodes and type of fault, it can be concluded that the use of\nthe input vectors 2 and 9 in the same algorithm can improve\nthe overall accuracy of the diagnostic. This reasoning can be\nrecapitulated in the ﬂowchart given by Figure 6 (denoted by\nmodel 1).\nTable 4 shows the diagnostic accuracy rate of the KNN\nalgorithm when using the input vector of DGA in ppm and\nthe combined Duval triangle and pentagon input vectors and\nthe proposed enhancement of diagnostic accuracy of the KNN\nalgorithm by the strategy of a decision tree.\nOne can see that the diagnostic accuracy rate achieved a\nvalue of 92.5% with the proposed method. It was 91.88%\nwith the input vector of DGA in ppm and 90.63% with the\ncombined Duval triangle and pentagon input vector when\nused alone (Table 3). The ﬁrst thermal fault node detected\nmany cases by T3, but the actual fault was T2. Therefore,\nanother model has been proposed, as in Figure 7, to overcome\nthis situation.\nThe second proposed model shows a high accuracy rate\nof 93.75% compared with the previous application given by\nTable 4. This imply that the second model is more accurate.\nFor further veriﬁcation, all proposed models are tested by an\nindependent new dataset of 20 samples. Table 5 shows the\nresults of both proposed models along with those related to\nthe KNN classiﬁer with input vectors 2 and 9.\nFor the validation phase, the results of Table 5 conﬁrm that\nthe second proposed model (model 2) gave the best accuracy\nrate compared to the other ones. An accuracy rate of 90%\nVOLUME 9, 2021 81699\nO. Kherifet al.: Accuracy Improvement of Power Transformer Faults Diagnostic Using KNN Classifier\nFIGURE 6. Proposed flowchart of improved diagnostic accuracy (Model 1).\nFIGURE 7. Proposed flowchart of improved diagnostic accuracy (Model 2).\nwas obtained against 80% when employing the ﬁrst proposed\n(model 1). Both models are more accurate than the traditional\nmethods of power transformer diagnosis as shown in Table 5.\nTable 6 illustrates the comparison between the KNN-DT\n(with model 2) diagnosis results and the Duval triangle,\nRogers ratios, and IEC 60 599 methods, the common DGA\nmethods in the literature. The results in Table 6 explained the\nhigh performance of the KNN- DT for correctly diagnose of\ntransformer faults where the KNN-DT accuracy succeeded\nin detecting 18 samples of 20 with 90% accuracy. On the\nother hand, the other three methods developed poor diag-\nnostic accuracies, which are 30% (6/20), 25% (4/20), and\n30% (6/20) for Duval triangle, Rogers’ ratio, and IEC code,\nrespectively. Therefore, the KNN-DT has high reliability to\ndiagnose transformer faults.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nOil-immersed power transformer fault diagnosis was inves-\ntigated using different DGA methods, in which a database\nset of 501 samples was exploited. A decision tree algorithm\nwas improved the KNN classiﬁer to enhance the accuracy\nof the transformer faults diagnostic. The neighbor’s number\nand distance type of the KNN algorithm were optimized to\nimprove the classiﬁer’s accuracy rate. Several input vectors\nwere assessed for each fault to select the most appropriate\nvector associated with this type of fault for the combina-\ntion of the KNN classiﬁer with the decision tree principle.\nThe obtained results were discussed, and two models were\nproposed in order to improve the global accuracy rate. Both\nproposed models conﬁrmed their accurateness where the\nglobal accuracy rate exceeded 93% for the power transformer\ndiagnosis. A complementary validation phase of the proposed\nresearch was also considered using an independent database.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the ﬁnancial sup-\nport received from Taif University Researchers Supporting\nProject Number (TURSP-2020/34), Taif University, Taif,\nSaudi Arabia.\nREFERENCES\n[1] IEEE Guide for the Interpretation of Gases Generated in Mineral Oil-\nImmersed Transformers, IEEE Standard C57.104-2019 (Revision IEEE\nStd C57.104-2008), Nov. 2019, pp. 1–98.\n[2] M.
