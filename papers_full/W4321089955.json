  "abstract": "Objectives Recurrence risk evaluation is clinically significant for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). We investigated the ability of transformer network in recurrence risk stratification of LACC based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Methods A total of 104 patients with pathologically diagnosed LACC between July 2017 and December 2021 were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent CT and MR scanning, and their recurrence status was identified by the biopsy. We randomly divided patients into training cohort (48 cases, non-recurrence: recurrence = 37: 11), validation cohort (21 cases, non-recurrence: recurrence = 16: 5), and testing cohort (35 cases, non-recurrence: recurrence = 27: 8), upon which we extracted 1989, 882 and 315 patches for model's development, validation and evaluation, respectively. The transformer network consisted of three modality fusion modules to extract multi-modality and multi-scale information, and a fully-connected module to perform recurrence risk prediction. The model's prediction performance was assessed by six metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, f1-score, sensitivity, specificity and precision. Univariate analysis with F-test and T-test were conducted for statistical analysis. Results The proposed transformer network is superior to conventional radiomics methods and other deep learning networks in both training, validation and testing cohorts. Particularly, in testing cohort, the transformer network achieved the highest AUC of 0.819 ± 0.038, while four conventional radiomics methods and two deep learning networks got the AUCs of 0.680 ± 0.050, 0.720 ± 0.068, 0.777 ± 0.048, 0.691 ± 0.103, 0.743 ± 0.022 and 0.733 ± 0.027, respectively. Conclusions The multi-modality transformer network showed promising performance in recurrence risk stratification of LACC and may be used as an effective tool to help clinicians make clinical decisions.",
