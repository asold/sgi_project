Our study demonstrates that investigating LLMs with methods from \npsychology has the potential to reveal otherwise unknown emergent traits. \n \nKeywords: large language models, machine behavior, intuition, cognitive reflection test, semantic \nillusions, computational social science \n \n  \n \n \n2 \n \n \nIntroduction \nAs the range of applications for large language models (LLMs) rapidly expands, it is of paramount \nimportance to understand the mechanisms through which LLMs reason and make decisions. Recent \nresearch has revealed that with the increasing complexity of LLMs, they exhibit a multitude of emergent \nproperties and abilities that were not explicitly anticipated or intended by their creators.1 Among these \nnewfound capabilities are the capacity to generate computer code, tackle mathematical problems, learn \nfrom examples, engage in introspection, solve theory of mind tasks, and a plethora of other skills.2–6 In \nthis paper, we aim to explore yet another emergent phenomenon, namely LLMs’ reasoning capabilities, \nwhile shedding light on the intricacies of their cognitive processes. \nResearch on humans often distinguishes between two broad categories of reasoning or—more broadly—\ncognitive processes: Systems 1 and 27–14. System 1 processes are fast, automatic, and instinctual. They \noften involve heuristics, or mental shortcuts, which enable quick judgments and decisions without \nconscious effort. System 1 is essential for everyday functioning, as it allows humans to navigate their \nenvironments and make rapid decisions with minimal effort. System 2 processes, on the other hand, are \ndeliberate and require conscious effort. This system is employed in logical reasoning, critical thinking, \nand problem-solving. System 2 processes are slower and more resource-intensive, but they are also more \naccurate and less susceptible to bias.  \nOn the surface, current-day LLMs are System 1 thinkers: The input text is processed by consecutive \nlayers of neurons to produce a distribution of probabilities of all possible single-token (word) \ncompletions. This process is automatic, unidirectional, and involves a single wave of propagation \nthrough the neural network for each consecutive predicted word.15 Current-day LLMs lack cognitive \ninfrastructure (such as short-term memory), which is needed for re-examining the starting assumptions, \ntesting alternative solutions, feedback loops, and other cognitive strategies typically associated with \ndeliberate System 2 processes.16 Yet, past research and the results presented in this paper suggest that, \nlike humans, LLMs can engage in both System 1 and System 2 cognitive processes. While generating \neach consecutive word, LLMs re-read the context, including the original input (e.g., a task provided by a \nuser) as well as the words they have thus far generated. As a result, the context may serve as an external \nshort-term memory, which LLMs can use to engage in chain-of-thought reasoning, re-examine the \nstarting assumptions, estimate partial solutions, or test alternative approaches. This is akin to how people \nuse notepads to solve mathematical problems or write essays to sharpen and develop their arguments.  \nIn this work, we build on psychological research on human reasoning and decision-making to explore \nSystem 1 and 2 processes in LLMs. We develop bespoke versions of two tests widely used in this field: \nthe cognitive reflection test (CRT)17 and semantic illusions18 (see Table 1 and Table S1 in \nSupplementary Materials). The CRT comprises three types of mathematical tasks that appear to be \nsimpler than they really are, thus triggering an intuitive but incorrect System 1 response. CRT Type 1 \ntasks, such as the widely known “A bat and a ball” task, use a “more than” phrase to trick participants \ninto subtracting two of the values rather than solving a somewhat more complex equation. Type 2 tasks \nexploit people’s tendency to complete a numerical triplet series, such as five machines making five \nwidgets in five minutes because two machines make two widgets in two minutes. Type 3 tasks describe \nan exponential process but trick the participants into treating it as linear. Solving CRT tasks correctly \nrequires engaging in deliberate System 2 reasoning or possessing well-developed System 1 intuitions. \nSemantic illusions are questions containing a disguised error aimed at triggering an intuitive but \n \n \n3 \n \n \nincorrect System 1 response. In the well-known Moses Illusion,18 for example, participants tend to be \ntricked into claiming that Moses took two animals of each kind on the Ark (it was Noah). \nPast research emphasized that LLMs tend to fall for the same traps as human participants in CRT \ntasks.19 Here we show that LLMs can also engage in processes resembling deliberate System 2 \nreasoning. Moreover, we show that as LLMs’ performance increases, their System-1-like next-word \ngeneration process becomes sufficiently acute to avoid falling for the traps embedded in the tasks. We \nalso address some of the limitations of past studies. First, while past research focused on a single model \n(GPT-3), we study reasoning capabilities across a range of models of different sizes and complexities. \nSecond, as solving CRT tasks requires mathematical abilities,20 LLMs’ performance could be limited by \ntheir mathematical skills. To address this issue, we complement the CRT tasks with semantic illusions \nthat do not rely on mathematical skills. Third, past research relied on three CRT tasks copied verbatim \nfrom human studies19. This is problematic, as observing LLMs’ performance on three CRT tasks does \nnot allow for meaningful statistical comparisons. Moreover, these tasks (as well as their solutions) were \nlikely present in LLMs’ training data.21 To circumvent these issues, we designed 50 bespoke versions of \neach type of task (200 in total; see Table S1).  \nFor brevity and convenience, we use words such as “behavior,” “intuition,” “deliberation,” or “ability” \nwhen referring to LLMs. Yet, we do not mean to equate artificial intelligence (AI) and human cognitive \nprocesses. While AI’s outputs are often similar to the ones produced by humans, it typically operates in \nfundamentally different ways.  \n \nTable 1.

CRT Type 1 and 2 tasks were generated automatically. All tasks can \nbe found in Table S1. The code and data used here are available at https://osf.io/w5vhp/. \nThe tasks were administered to the family of OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) \nmodels ranging from GPT-1 to ChatGPT-4.6,22–24 To minimize the variance in the models’ responses and \nthus increase the replicability of our results, the “temperature” parameter was set to 0. The response \nlength was set to 100 tokens but was extended as needed. The models’ responses were trimmed once \nthey started repeating themselves or stopped responding to the task. The LLMs’ responses were \nreviewed and scored manually. For clarity, the scoring is discussed in detail in the results section.  \nThe same tasks were also administered to 500 human participants recruited on Prolific.io. Each \nparticipant was presented with a random set of four tasks (one of each kind) followed by a control \nquestion inquiring whether they used a language model or another external resource. (45 participants \nresponded positively and were excluded from the analysis.) Human respondents’ performance suggests \nthat our tasks were of similar difficulty to those used in past human studies. In CRT, 38% of responses \nwere correct, compared with 41% in the original study (n=3,428)9 (difference (𝛿) = 3%; 𝜒2 =\n3.60; 𝑝 = .06). In semantic illusions, 64% of participants responded intuitively, compared with 52% in \nthe original study (n=61; they did not report the fraction of correct responses; (𝛿 = 12%; 𝜒2 =\n2.41; 𝑝 = .12).29  \nStudy 1: Cognitive Reflection Test \nWe first test the LLMs’ performance on CRT tasks. To help the reader interpret the results, we discuss \nthem in the context of LLMs’ exemplary responses to CRT Type 3 task #14: \n \n \n5 \n \n \n“In a cave, there is a colony of bats with a daily population doubling. Given that it takes 60 days \nfor the entire cave to be filled with bats, how many days would it take for the cave to be half-\nfilled with bats?” \nThe correct response to this task is “59 days,” but it was designed to appear easier than it really is, \ntempting participants to simply divide the total time by two, triggering an intuitive (but incorrect) \nresponse of “30 days.” LLMs and humans’ responses to this and other CRT tasks were divided into three \ncategories: correct, intuitive (but incorrect), and atypical, which includes all other incorrect responses. \nMoreover, in each category of responses, the fraction of LLMs’ responses preceded by a written chain-\nof-thought reasoning are marked by black dots (only one human described their reasoning process).  \nThe overall performance of humans and LLMs across 150 CRT tasks is presented in Figure 1 (the Study \n1 section). The results, split by CRT task types, are presented in Table S2. Four trends are apparent in \nFigure 1. First, most of the responses of early and smaller LLMs (up until GPT-3-curie) were classified \nas atypical (gray bars). This category includes responses that were evasive (e.g., GPT-1’s response “a \nlot”); indicated failure to comprehend the task (e.g., GPT-2XL’s response “The colony would take 60 \ndays to double in size”); or were incorrect in ways different from one that the task was designed to \ntrigger (e.g., GPT-3-babbage’s response: “It would take about 10 days for the cave to be half-filled with \nbats”). Moreover, while 15% of responses of both GPT-3-babbage and GPT-3-curie were categorized as \ncorrect (green bars), they seemed accidental. All but one were given to CRT Type 2 tasks (see Table \nS2), which can be solved by simply repeating the number mentioned most frequently in the prompt—\nwhich these models tended to naively do in this and other tasks.  \nSecond, as the models grew larger and their ability to comprehend the task increased, atypical responses \nwere replaced by intuitive (but incorrect) responses (blue bars), which the tasks were designed to trigger \n(e.g., GPT-3-davinci-003: “30 days”). They constituted below 5% of responses of early models (up to \nGPT-3-babbage); increased to 21% for GPT-3-curie (difference (𝛿) = 16%; 𝜒2 = 16.98; 𝑝 < .001); \nand further increased to 70%–90% for the GPT-3-davinci family (𝛿 ≥ 49%; 𝜒2 ≥ 69.64; 𝑝 < .001), a \nfraction much higher than one observed in humans (55%; 𝛿 ≥ 15%; 𝜒2 ≥ 11.79; 𝑝 < .001). \nIn humans, such responses are interpreted as evidence of System 1 reasoning and failure to engage \nSystem 2, but they could also stem from deliberate—but erroneous—System 2 reasoning. The \ngenerative process behind the LLMs’ responses is less ambiguous. As we discuss in the introduction, \ncurrent-day LLMs lack the built-in cognitive infrastructure necessary to internally engage in System 2 \nprocesses. Consequently, their intuitive responses can only stem from a System-1-like process.  \nImportantly, LLMs’ tendency to respond intuitively is unlikely to be driven by their insufficient \nmathematical skills. First, prior research showed that LLMs can solve basic mathematical problems.2,5 \nSecond, responding intuitively to CRT Type 1 and 3 tasks also requires solving a simple equation (e.g., \nhow much is “half of 60”; responding intuitively to CRT Type 2 tasks requires no computation). \nMoreover, as we show in Study 3, GPT-3-davinci-003’s performance can be significantly improved by \npresenting it with training examples. \nThird, LLMs’ strong tendency to respond intuitively stops abruptly with the arrival of ChatGPT. The \nfraction of correct responses equaled 59% for ChatGPT-3.5 and 96% for ChatGPT-4. This is much \nhigher than 5% of tasks solved correctly by GPT-3-davinci-003, an otherwise very apt model (𝛿 ≥\n54%; 𝜒2 ≥ 102.44; 𝑝 < .001) or 38% achieved by humans (𝛿 ≥ 21%; 𝜒2 ≥ 25.60; 𝑝 < .001). \nChatGPT’s tendency to respond correctly was accompanied by a significant drop in their tendency to \n \n \n6 \n \n \nrespond intuitively: 15% for ChatGPT-3.5 and 0% for ChatGPT-4 versus 80% for GPT-3-davinci-003 \n(𝛿 ≥ 65%; 𝜒2 ≥ 125.81; 𝑝 < .001) and 55% for humans (𝛿 ≥ 40%; 𝜒2 ≥ 86.30; 𝑝 < .001). \n \nFigure 1. Overall human and LLM performance on CRT tasks.  \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nA closer look at ChatGPT models’ responses reveals that the dramatic increase in their performance was \naccompanied by a novel response style. While pre-ChatGPT LLMs responded with brief phrases or \nsingle sentences (e.g., GPT-3-davinci-003: “30 days”), 97% of ChatGPT-3.5’s responses and 85% of \nChatGPT-4.5’s responses included some form of chain-of-thought reasoning (such responses are marked \nwith black dots on bars on Figure 1). See, for example, ChatGPT-3.5’s response to CRT Type 1 task \n#14:  \nChatGPT-3.5: “If the population doubles every day, then the number of bats in the cave after n \ndays is 2^n times the original population. Let P be the original population of the colony. \nAfter 60 days, the population is 2^60 * P, which is the capacity of the cave. \nTo find the number of days it takes for the cave to be half-filled with bats, we need to find the \nvalue of n such that the population is half of the capacity of the cave. \n0.5 * 2^60 * P = 2^n * P \nDividing both sides by P, we get: \n0.5 * 2^60 = 2^n \nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get: \nn = 60 + log2(0.5) = 60 - 1 = 59 \nTherefore, it would take 59 days for the cave to be half-filled with bats.” \n \nAs we discussed before, there is nothing deliberate in how ChatGPT-3.5 and other current-day LLMs \ngenerate the next word. Yet, each time the word is generated, LLM re-reads the task and the response it \ngenerated so far, combining System-1-like next-word generation into something resembling a System 2 \nprocess: generating a strategy needed to solve the task, dividing the task into more tractable subtasks, \nand solving them one by one. This is akin to how humans use a notebook to solve mathematical tasks \nwithout the need to process them in their short-term memory. In Study 2, we will show evidence \nsuggesting that chain-of-thought responses not only resemble but also serve as a System 2 process. \nStudy 2: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in CRT Tasks \nThe results of Study 1 show that the abrupt increase in LLMs’ performance on CRT tasks was \naccompanied by their employment of the chain-of-thought reasoning. Past research suggests that \ninstructing LLMs to engage in chain-of-thought reasoning improves their ability to solve various tasks.3 \nCould it be that we observed a similar phenomenon here?  \nTo answer this question, we first instruct GPT-3-davinci-003 to engage in the chain-of-thought \nreasoning by adding the following suffix after the prompt: “Let’s use algebra to solve this problem.” The \nresults presented in Figure 1 (in the Study 2 section) show that our manipulation was successful: The \nfraction of chain-of-thought responses increased from 0% in Study 1 to 100% (𝛿 =  100%; 𝜒2 =\n147.01; 𝑝 < .001). The model seemed to design and execute a task-solving strategy. In some cases, it \nwas sound, boosting the fraction of correct responses from 5% to 28% (𝛿 = 23%; 𝜒2 = 28.20; 𝑝 <\n.001). Most of the time, it was poorly conceived or executed, leading to the increase of atypical \nresponses from 15% to 43% (𝛿 = 28%; 𝜒2 = 14.72; 𝑝 < .001). Most importantly, it significantly \nreduced a model’s tendency to fall for the trap embedded in the task, as illustrated by the drop in the \nfraction of intuitive responses from 80% to 29% (𝛿 = 51%; 𝜒2 = 75.66; 𝑝 < .001).  \nNext, we prevent ChatGPT models from engaging in chain-of-thought reasoning by adding the \nfollowing suffix: “Provide the shortest possible answer (e.g., ‘$2’ or ‘1 week’), do not explain your \n \n \n8 \n \n \nreasoning.” The results presented in Figure 1 (the Study 2 section) show that our manipulation was \nsuccessful: The fraction of chain-of-thought responses fell from 97% to 0% for ChatGPT-3.5 (𝛿 =\n97%; 𝜒2 = 276.79; 𝑝 < .001) and from 84% to 0% for ChatGPT-4 (𝛿 = 84%; 𝜒2 = 213.81; 𝑝 <\n.001). The fraction of correct responses for ChatGPT-3.5 did not significantly change (𝛿 = 4%; 𝜒2 =\n0.47; 𝑝 = .49). For ChatGPT-4, the fraction of intuitive responses increased from 0% to 10% (𝛿 =\n10%; 𝜒2 = 13.75; 𝑝 < .001), and correct responses fell from 95% to 88% (𝛿 = 7%; 𝜒2 = 4.36; 𝑝 <\n.05). \nThe results of Study 2 suggest that chain-of-thought reasoning helps LLMs to avoid falling for the traps \nembedded in the CRT tasks and improves their ability to solve them correctly. Yet, they also reveal that \nChatGPT models can solve a great majority of CRT tasks even when forced to provide a System-1-like \nresponse. This suggests that ChatGPT models have well-developed intuition, enabling them to solve \nCRT tasks without engaging in chain-of-thought reasoning. This is consistent with ChatGPT-4’s \nperformance in Study 1, where it solved 24% of the CRT task without using chain-of-thought reasoning. \nStudy 3 explores this phenomenon in greater detail. \nStudy 3: Improving LLMs’ Intuition in CRT Tasks \nThe results of Study 2 suggest that the most recent of the LLMs examined here—the ChatGPT family—\ncan avoid falling for the trap embedded in CRT tasks and solve them correctly, even when prevented \nfrom engaging in the chain-of-thought System-2-like reasoning. In humans, this would be taken as \nevidence of a well-developed intuition stemming from previous exposure to CRT or similar tasks25,26 \n(although the persistence and size of this effect is disputed27,28). Here we show results suggesting that \nthe same applies to LLMs. This is in line with past results showing that LLMs can learn, even from a \nsingle example. \n \n \nFigure 2. Change in the fraction of correct responses of GPT-3-davinci-003 against the number of \ntraining examples that the task was prefixed with.  \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nAs ChatGPT models already seem to possess well-developed intuition, we attempt to improve the \nSystem-1-like responses of GPT-3-davinci-003. We present it with CRT tasks, each time preceding it \nwith 0 to 49 remaining tasks of the same type, accompanied by the correct solution. CRT tasks of the \nsame type are semantically very similar, enabling the model to develop System-1 intuitions akin to one \nexpressed by the ChatGPT model family.  \nThe results presented in Figure 2 show that GPT-3-davinci-003’s ability to answer correctly (rather than \nintuitively) increased with each additional example. The fastest gains were observed for CRT Type 2 \ntasks, where the accuracy increases from 2% to 92% after two examples (𝛿 = 90%; 𝜒2 = 77.72; 𝑝 <\n.001). This is to be expected, as they can be solved correctly by simply repeating the duration listed in \nthe task. To solve CRT Type 3, one needs to respond with the total time minus one unit. They proved to \nbe somewhat more complex: The accuracy increased from 12% to 92% after seven training examples \n(𝛿 = 80%; 𝜒2 = 60.94; 𝑝 < .001). It took most examples to develop the model’s intuition to solve CRT \nType 1 tasks, where the correct answer equals \n𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒−𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒\n2 . But even here, the model’s \naccuracy increased from 0% to about 78% accuracy after 30 examples (𝛿 = 78%; 𝜒2 = 60.70; 𝑝 <\n.001).  \nStudy 4: Semantic Illusions \nCRT tasks employed in Studies 1 to 3 rely heavily on mathematical skills and are highly semantically \nuniform. To make sure that the results generalize beyond the CRT tasks, we examine LLMs’ \nperformance on much more semantically diverse tasks: semantic illusions. Like CRT tasks, semantic \nillusions contain a disguised error aimed at triggering an intuitive but incorrect System 1 response. \nUnlike CRT tasks, semantic illusions do not require mathematical skills, instead relying on participants’ \ngeneral knowledge.  \nTo help the reader interpret the results, we discuss them in the context of LLMs’ exemplary responses to \nsemantic illusion #47: \n“Which famous artist designed the famous church, la Sagrada Familia, located in Madrid?” \nAs in the context of CRT tasks, responses were divided into three categories: intuitive, correct, and \natypical. The question was designed to trigger an intuitive System-1 response “Antoni Gaudí” while \noverlooking the embedded invalid assumption (e.g., la Sagrada Familia is in Barcelona). Yet, responding \n“Antoni Gaudí” can be treated as indicative of System 1 processing only if the respondent has the \nknowledge necessary to recognize the error. Thus, given an intuitive response, the model was reset, and \nits underlying knowledge was tested using an additional question (here: “Where is the famous church, la \nSagrada Familia, located?”; see Table S3). Intuitive responses given by LLMs that failed this post-hoc \ntest were recategorized as atypical, along with responses revealing a further lack of necessary \nknowledge (e.g., GPT-3-babbage: “Francisco Goya”) and nonsensical responses (e.g., GPT-1 “the \nchurch of san francisco”). Responses that recognized that this question is invalid were categorized as \ncorrect (e.g., ChatGPT-4’s response: “La Sagrada Familia is actually located in Barcelona, not Madrid, \nand was designed by the famous Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí.”). \nThe results presented in Figure 3 show a pattern similar to the one observed in the context of CRT tasks. \nMost of the responses of early and smaller LLMs (up to GPT-3-babbage) were atypical (gray bars), as \nthey struggled to comprehend the question or lacked the necessary knowledge. As LLMs grow in size \nand sophistication, the fraction of atypical responses fell from 52% for GPT-3-babbage to 10% for GPT-\n \n \n10 \n \n \n3-davinci-003 (𝛿 = 42%; 𝜒2 = 18.70; 𝑝 < .001). They were replaced by intuitive responses (blue bars): \nGPT-3-davinci-003 fell for the semantic illusion 72% of the time. As in the context of CRT tasks, this \ntrend changes dramatically with the introduction of ChatGPT. The fraction of correct responses \nincreased from 18% for GPT-3-davinci-003 to 74% and 88% for ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, \nrespectively (green bars; 𝛿 ≥ 56%; 𝜒2 = 29.35; 𝑝 < .001). As we discussed before, there is nothing \ndeliberate in LLMs’ next-word generation process. Yet, this System-1-like process proved to be very apt \nat detecting invalid assumptions embedded in semantic illusions.  \n \nFigure 3. Overall human and LLM performance in semantic illusions tasks. Confidence intervals are \nreported in Table S1.  \nStudy 5: Improving LLMs’ Performance on Semantic Illusions \nThe results of Studies 2 and 3 suggest that LLMs’ propensity to commit reasoning errors in CRT tasks \ncan be reduced by instructing them to examine the task more carefully and providing them with \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nexamples of correct solutions to similar tasks. Study 5 replicates those results in the context of semantic \nillusions.  \nWe first add the suffix “Think carefully and check the question for invalid assumptions” to each \nsemantic illusion and administer them to GPT-3-davinci-003. The results presented in Figure 3 (the \nStudy 5 section) show that the fraction of correct responses increased threefold, from 18% in Study 4 to \n54% (𝛿 = 36%; 𝜒2 = 12.54; 𝑝 < .001), while the fraction of intuitive responses decreased from 72% to \n28% (𝛿 = 44%; 𝜒2 = 17.64; 𝑝 < .001).  \nNext, as in Study 3, we precede each semantic illusion with 0 to 49 other semantic illusions, \naccompanied by the correct solution. The results presented in Figure 4 show that GPT-3-davinci-003’s \nability to answer correctly increased from 18% for 0 examples to over 64% for 10 and more examples \n(𝛿 ≥ 46%; 𝜒2 = 20.01; 𝑝 < .001).  \nIn summary, LLMs’ performance on semantic illusions mirrored the one observed in CRT: The early \nmodels struggled with comprehending the tasks, the later models showed an above-human tendency to \nrespond intuitively (but incorrectly), and the most recent ChatGPT models showed an above-human \nability to avoid succumbing to semantic illusions. Moreover, as in the context of CRT tasks, GPT-3-\ndavinci-003’s performance could be significantly improved by instructing it to engage in careful \nreasoning and by boosting its intuition by exposing it to training examples.  \n \n \nFigure 4. Change in the fraction of correct responses of GPT-3-davinci-003 against the number of \ntraining examples that the task was prefixed with.  \nDiscussion \nIn this work, we studied reasoning processes in LLMs using CRT and semantic illusions, widely used to \nstudy reasoning processes in humans. Our results reveal three major patterns. First, Studies 1 and 4 show \nthat as LLMs grow in size and their ability to comprehend the tasks increase, they tend to fall for the \ntrap embedded in the tasks and respond intuitively—which, in humans, would be interpreted as evidence \nof fast, automatic, and instinctual System 1 processing. GPT-3-davinci-003, for example, responded \n\n \n \n12 \n \n \nintuitively in 80% CRT tasks and 72% semantic illusions, a fraction higher than the one observed in \nhumans (55% and 64%, respectively). How would one explain pre-ChatGPT models’ tendency to \nrespond intuitively, despite their sufficient mathematical abilities and factual knowledge demonstrated in \nStudies 3, 4, and 5? As we discuss in the introduction, LLMs lack the cognitive infrastructure necessary \nto engage in System 2 processes, which some humans may successfully activate when answering such \nquestions. Thus, in the absence of well-developed intuition or explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, they \nare particularly prone to fall for the traps embedded in the tasks. \nSecond, the tendency to respond intuitively changed abruptly with the arrival of ChatGPT models, \nwhich responded correctly to a great majority of tasks, avoiding semantic traps embedded in them. \nChatGPT-4, for example, responded correctly to 95% of CRT tasks and 88% of semantic illusions, \ncompared with 38% and 26% in humans, respectively. The majority of ChatGPT’s responses to CRT \ntasks involved chain-of-thought reasoning, where the models developed strategies needed to solve the \ntask, examined the starting assumptions, estimated partial solutions, or tested alternative approaches. \nThis confirms past results showing that LLMs can engage in System-2-like reasoning using their input-\noutput context window, in a way akin to how people use notepads to solve mathematical problems or \nwrite essays to develop their arguments. The results of Study 2 further confirm that chain-of-thought \nreasoning can boost LLMs’ performance: The fraction of GPT-3-davinci-003’s correct responses to \nCRT tasks increased from 5% to 28% when it was made to engage in chain-of-thought reasoning in its \noutput-input context window. \nThird, further analysis reveals that while ChatGPT models tended to engage in chain-of-thought \nreasoning in their responses to CRT tasks, they could solve both CRT tasks and semantic illusions \nwithout it. Study 2 shows that ChatGPT models answer correctly to the great majority of CRT tasks \neven when prevented from engaging in chain-of-thought reasoning. Also, Study 4 shows that their \nresponses to semantic illusions were both predominantly correct and did not include chain-of-thought \nreasoning. This suggests that ChatGPT models have well-developed intuitions enabling them to solve \nCRT tasks and semantic illusions without engaging System-2 like processes. This finding is further \nsupported by Studies 3 and 5 showing that GPT-3-davinci-003’s performance on both CRT tasks and \nsemantic illusions can be significantly increased by presenting it with example tasks and their correct \nsolutions.  \nWhat drove the steep shift in accuracy and response style between GPT-3 and ChatGPT? Some progress \nis to be expected. In humans, CRT and semantic illusions are good predictors of ability to engage in \nunbiased, reflective, and rational decision-making,29–32 as well as overall cognitive ability.17,32 Thus, \nLLMs’ ability to solve CRT and semantic illusions should increase as their overall ability increases. Yet, \nthe shift observed in this study seems to be steeper than the increase in LLMs’ overall abilities. We can \nonly speculate, given that OpenAI shares limited information on the technical specification and training \nprocess of their models. First, it is unlikely that the shift was driven merely by larger model size. \nAccording to OpenAI, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo was derived from text-davinci-003 by fine-tuning it for chat. \nBoth models are likely of similar size. Second, it could be that the shift was driven by the employment \nof reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).33,34 In RLHF, human-written demonstrations \non example prompts are used to train supervised learning baselines. Next, human “AI trainers” rank \nmodel outputs on a larger set of API prompts, and a reward model is trained to predict their preferences. \nThis reward model is then used to fine-tune the models using Proximal Policy Optimization \nAlgorithms.35 While RLHF was employed since GPT-3 text-davinci-002,33 this procedure was enhanced \n \n \n13 \n \n \nin ChatGPT training: AI trainers played both sides—the user and an AI assistant.36 Third, it is likely that \nChatGPT models were exposed to sufficient CRT-like tasks in their training to be able to respond to \nthem intuitively. Those tasks are highly semantically similar and, as the results of Study 3 illustrate, \nexposure to training examples can rapidly boost an LLM’s ability to solve them correctly. This \nexplanation is less likely in the context of semantic illusions, which are much more irregular and \ndiverse. This question will hopefully be addressed by further research or more transparency in LLMs’ \ndevelopment.  \nNext to the analysis of LLMs’ performance on reasoning tasks, one can approach the issue from a \nnormative perspective, asking whether phenomena of intuitive decision-making are desirable in LLMs. \nIn the cognitive science literature, researchers stress that the notion of intuitive errors relies on a \nnormative concept of logics and statistics, which can be inappropriate for real-world situations. Instead, \ndecision-making processes should be evaluated in the sense of “ecological rationality,” meaning based \non how well they fit the structure of the environment in which they occur.37–39 In this vein, CRT tasks as \nwell as semantic illusions create a “hostile” test environment, which intentionally aims to mislead \nhumans. Regarding an ecologically rational response to semantic illusions, one can ask: Should LLMs \ngo with the conversational flow and just “overlook” small mistakes instead of correcting factually \nincorrect questions? In conversations between humans, rapid turn-taking between communication \npartners demonstrates high degrees of communicative coordination, which avoids interruption.40 This \nprocess is likely to fail if semantic structures would be continuously checked in a verbatim analysis. If \nlanguage models behave similarly, this would mean that they promote fluent communication, which \nmight be an important capability as soon as these models are natural interlocutors in ordinary social \ncontexts. On the other hand, “hallucinated” outputs, factual incorrectness, and misinformation harms are \na major problem in LLMs.41,42 Nevertheless, and apart from normative discussions regarding the \nevaluation and intuitive “errors,” it remains noteworthy that even in hostile test environments such as the \nCRT or semantic illusions, state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 can (in most cases) be \ntriggered to not make mistakes. This speaks for their remarkable reasoning abilities, no matter whether \nthese reflect “logical intuitions”7 or deliberate reasoning, which are likely to have effects in numerous \nareas other than our test environment. \nThe progress in LLMs not only increased their capabilities, but also reduced our ability to anticipate \ntheir properties and behavior. It is increasingly difficult to study LLMs through the lenses of their \narchitecture and hyperparameters.19,43,44 Instead, as we show in this work, LLMs can be studied using \nmethods designed to investigate another capable and opaque structure, namely the human mind.45,46 Our \napproach falls within a quickly growing category of studies employing classical psychological tests and \nexperiments to probe LLMs’ “psychological” processes such as judgment, decision-making, or cognitive \nbiases.19,44,47–49 \nReferences \n1.
