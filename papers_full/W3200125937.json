  "abstract": "Transformers are one of the primary device required for an AC (Alternating Current) distribution system which works on the principle of mutual induction without any rotating parts. There are two types of transformers are utilized in the distribution systems namely step up transformer and step down transformer. The step up transformers are need to be placed at some regular distances for reducing the line losses happening over the electrical transmission systems. Similarly the step down transformers are placed near to the destinations for regulating the electricity power for the commercial usage. Certain regular check-ups are must for a distribution transformer for increasing its operational life time. The proposed work is designed to regularize such health check-ups using IoT sensors for making a centralized remote monitoring system.",
