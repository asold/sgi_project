Drosophila body size is determined by various developmental cues that coordinate tissue\npatterning with growth, and by environmental cues such as nutrients and oxygen, that regulate\nwhole body metabolism. One important, but often overlooked, determinant of size inDrosoph-\nila is sex– adult females are significantly, and visibly, larger than males [3, 4]. This sexual size\ndimorphism (SSD) arises due to differences in larval growth: males and females have a similar\noverall duration of larval development, but females achieve critical weight at a larger size and\ngrow more during the terminal growth period [5]. While over two decades of genetic research\nhave identified many conserved signaling pathways that link developmental and environmen-\ntal cues to the control of tissue and body size [6– 9], the genetic and physiological mechanisms\nthat account for the larger female body size remain unclear.\nIn flies, sex is determined by the ratio of sex chromosomes to autosomes (X:A) [10]. In\nfemales, the X:A ratio is 1, and a functional protein is produced from theSex-lethal (Sxl) locus\n[11, 12]. In males, the X:A ratio is 0.5, and no Sxl is produced. Sxl is a master regulator of\nfemale sexual development (eg. sexual differentiation, reproduction), and Sxl mutant females\nare smaller than wild-type females. This is due, in large part, to the sex-specific splicing of its\ndownstream target genetransformer (tra)[ 13– 16]. As a result of this Sxl-dependent splicing, a\nfunctional Tra protein is produced in females, but not males. Tra is a splicing factor, and has\nonly two known direct targets:doublesex (dsx) andfruitless (fru)[ 17– 22]. While Tra is thought\nto mediate most of Sxl’s effects on sex determination, the control of sex differences in body size\nis thought to be independent of the Tra/Dsx/Fru branch of the sex determination pathway\n[23]. Here, we identify for the first time a role for Tra as a key regulator of SSD inDrosophila.\nFurther, we show that Tra’s effects on SSD are mediated by a novel pathway that is indepen-\ndent ofdsx and fru, and of other aspects of sexual dimorphism.\nResults\nTra regulates sex differences in body size\nFemale and maleDrosophila larvae show no difference in their rate of development [5]. How-\never, by the end of larval life, female body size is approximately 30% larger than male body size\n(Fig 1A and 1B). These differences are not due to sex differences in food intake or feeding\nbehaviour (S1A and S1B Fig). Although the prevailing view is thattra does not regulate sex dif-\nferences in body size [24], one study showed that adult weight intra mutant females was\nreduced compared to wild-type females [25]. However, this weight reduction can be explained\nby the lack of ovaries intra mutant females. We therefore tested whether the decreased weight\nwas due to an effect oftra on growth by measuring pupal volume intra mutant animals. We\nfound that body size was significantly reduced intra mutant females compared to wild-type\nfemales (Fig 1C and 1D). Thus while wild-type females are 30% larger in body size than males,\ntra mutant females are only 10% larger than males. This suggests thattra contributes to estab-\nlishing SSD inDrosophila. Body size was unchanged intra mutant males, consistent with the\nlack of a functional Tra protein in males (Fig 1D). We also performed loss-of-function experi-\nments withtra, using an RNAi transgene directed againsttra’s splicing co-factortra2 (UAS-\ntra2-RNAi). We found that ubiquitous expression of theUAS-tra2-RNAi transgene using the\nAct5c-GAL4 driver successfully transformed female animals into phenotypic males (S1C Fig),\nand led to a reduction in body size (S1D Fig).\nWe next examined whether lack of Tra expression in males could explain their smaller body\nsize.

Interestingly, overexpression\nof Tra also stimulated growth in females, showing Tra has growth-promoting effects in both\nsexes. While previous studies have shown that high levels of Tra expression can cause artifacts\nsuch as lethality [26], this is the first report of an alternative splicing factor promoting body\nFig 1.

To further confirm these Tra-dependent changes in body size, we mea-\nsured adult weight. In order to ensure thattra’s effects on adult weight are not confounded by\nits effects on ovary or testis development, we weighed 5-day-old animals from which the\ngonads were removed by dissection. As with pupal volume, we found thattra mutant females,\nbut nottra mutant males, were significantly smaller than controls (S2A Fig). Overexpression of\nUAS-tra caused an increase in body weight in males (S2B Fig). Together, these results suggest\nthat male-female differences in body size are created in part by the presence of Tra in females,\nand the absence of Tra in males. This defines a new role for Tra in the regulation of sex differ-\nences in body growth.\nTra regulates growth in a cell-autonomous manner\nAs with body size, female cell size in the wing [27], and the fat body (Fig 2A) are larger. Since\none previous study showed that wing cell size intra mutant females was intermediate in size\nbetween female and male cells [25], we tested whether Tra expression could mediate cell-\nautonomous effects on growth by expressing eitherUAS-tra or theUAS-tra2-RNAi transgenes\nin the fat body (polyploid cells) and the wing disc cells (mitotic cells) of developing larvae. We\nfound thatflp-out-mediated mosaic expression ofUAS-tra2-RNAi in female fat body caused a\nsignificant reduction in cell size (Fig 2B). Consistent with the lack of a functional Tra protein\nin males, similarUAS-tra2-RNAi expression in males did not affect cell size (Fig 2B). In con-\ntrast, overexpression ofUAS-tra in fat body cells was sufficient to increase cell size in both\nsexes (Fig 2C). We next examined whether Tra expression could affect sex differences in\nanother larval tissue, the wing disc. Usingengrailed (en)-GAL4, we expressed eitherUAS-\ntra2-RNAi or UAS-tra transgenes in the posterior compartment of the wing, and measured\ncompartment size. We found a significant reduction in compartment size in female wings\nwhen we knocked down Tra function byUAS-tra2-RNAi expression (Fig 2D). This effect was\nalso seen when we used a secondUAS-tra2-RNAi transgene (S3A Fig). In contrast, male com-\npartment size was unaffected (Fig 2D). To determine whether this reduction in compartment\nsize was due to a decrease in cell number or cell size, we counted wing hairs in a fixed area in\nthe posterior compartment in females. Each wing cell secretes one hair, thus by counting wing\nhairs we can accurately determine how many cells are present in a specific area. We found that\nthe number of cells in the counting area was significantly increased in the compartments\nexpressing UAS-tra2-RNAi compared to controls (Fig 2E). This suggests that the reduction in\ncompartment size is due to a reduction in cell size, rather than cell number. Indeed, the esti-\nmated cell number in the posterior compartment of the wing was not significantly altered by\nexpression ofUAS-tra2-RNAi (Fig 2F). Overexpression ofUAS-tra using en-GAL4 caused no\nsignificant increase in compartment size in either males or females (S3B Fig). Together, these\nresults demonstrate a cell-autonomous requirement for Tra in females to promote increased\nfemale cell size in both mitotic and endoreplicating cells. This result supports previous findings\nfrom early gynandromorph studies, where sex differences in cell size were regulated in a cell-\nautonomous manner [28]. More recently, Sxl expression in the wing disc was shown to pro-\nmote growth [29]; however, altering either the X:A ratio or Sxl expression also affects the pro-\ncess of dosage compensation. Since Tra does not affect this process [30], our results\ndemonstrate that sex differences in cell size can be uncoupled from dosage compensation.\nTra function in the fat body controls growth in a non cell-autonomous\nmanner\nAn emerging literature inDrosophila has highlighted the importance of noncell-autonomous\nsignaling in the control of body growth [31– 34]. This signaling relies on organ-to-organ\ntransformer Regulates Sex Differences in Body Size\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005683 December 28, 2015 4/2 3\nFig 2.tra regulates growth in a cell-autonomous, and a non cell-autonomous manner.(A) Fat body cell size is significantly larger in wild-type females\n(p = 7.6 x 10−7; Student’s t-test).

We therefore tested whether sex differences in overall body size\nmay also involve non-autonomous effects of Tra function specific tissues. We used a number\nof tissue-specific GAL4 drivers to express theUAS-tra2-RNAi transgene in larvae, and mea-\nsured pupal volume in these animals. We found that loss of Tra in the fat body caused a signifi-\ncant reduction in female body size (Fig 2G). This reduction in body size was also observed in\nfemales expressing a secondUAS-tra2-RNAi transgene in the fat body (S3C Fig). Expression of\nUAS-tra2-RNAi in neurons, glia, ring gland or in muscle did not reproduce the female-specific\neffects of the fat body (S4A Fig), and male body size was unaffected by expression of theUAS-\ntra2-RNAi transgene in any tissue (S4B Fig). We next asked whether expression ofUAS-tra in\nspecific tissues was sufficient to drive an increase in body size. Tissue-specific expression of\nUAS-tra using a panel of GAL4 drivers did not significantly affect body size in wild-type\nfemales or males (S5A and S5B Fig). We then asked whether tissue-specific expression of Tra\ncould rescue the body size defects oftra mutant females. We found that ubiquitous, or fat-spe-\ncific, expression of Tra was sufficient to rescue a normal body size totra mutant females (Fig\n2H). Together, these results suggest that the decreased body size intra mutant females is due to\nfat-specific loss of Tra function. Tra controls many aspects of sexual differentiation, including\ngonad and germline differentiation, and previous studies inC. elegans showed that the germ-\nline can influence body growth [35]. We therefore tested whether Tra expression in these tis-\nsues could explain its effects on female body size. However, we found that gonad- or germline-\nspecific expression of aUAS-tra2-RNAi transgene using thec587-GAL4 or nanos (nos)-GAL4\ndrivers, respectively, caused no significant reduction in body size in females (S6A and S6B Fig).\nSimilarly, body size was unaffected in males and females completely lacking a germline (the\nprogeny oftudor\n1 homozygous mutant females crossed to wild-type males;S6C Fig). Decreased\nbody size intra mutant females is therefore not due to the presence of a male gonad or germ-\nline. Instead, our results suggest the sex of the fat body, as determined by Tra expression, con-\ntrols body growth in a non cell-autonomous manner.\nTra’s regulation of body size is independent offru and dsx\nTra is a splicing factor, and has only two known direct targets:doublesex (dsx) andfruitless\n(fru)[ 17– 22]. Dsx is expressed in a handful of tissues throughout the body and in a restricted\nexpression pattern in the central nervous system (CNS) in both males and females [36– 40]. In\nfemales, Tra binding todsx pre-mRNA causes a female-specific Dsx isoform to be produced\n(DsxF). In males, which express no functional Tra protein, a default splice indsx pre-mRNA\ngenerates a male-specific isoform of Dsx (DsxM)[ 19, 20]. Tra binding to the pre-mRNA of\ntranscripts from thefru P1 promoter causes the introduction of a stop codon, and no Fru P1\nprotein is expressed in females. In males, the lack of Tra leads to the use of a default splice in\nfru P1 transcripts, generating a male-specific Fru P1 protein (FruM)[ 17, 18]. FruM expression\nis limited to males in approximately 2000 neurons in the CNS and peripheral nervous system\n(PNS) [18, 41]. Importantly,dsx and fru are thought to mediate most, if not all, effects of Tra\non sex determination and behaviour [42, 43].

We first examined whether mutants lacking Dsx or FruM\nexpression phenocopied any of Tra’s effects on growth. We found thatdsx mutant animals\n(genotype dsx1/Df(3R)dsx15), had no significant difference in pupal volume compared to con-\ntrols in either males or females (Fig 3A). We also examined the effect of Dsx knockdown in the\nfat body using aUAS-dsx RNAiline. Using theflp-out system, we found that mosaic expression\nof UAS-dsx RNAiled to reduced fat cell size in both males and females, suggesting thatdsx reg-\nulates cell size in this tissue (Fig 3B). However, expression ofUAS-dsx-RNAi throughout the fat\nbody usingr4-GAL4 did not recapitulate the non cell-autonomous reduction of body size\nobserved upon Tra inhibition in this tissue (Fig 3C). While it seems counterintuitive that Dsx\ncauses a reduction in size in the fat body, but does not affect body size,dsx expression is\nrestricted to specific tissues in larvae [37, 39]. Thus while loss ofdsx may affect cell size in a rel-\natively small number of tissues, the expression may not be broad enough to cause a reduction\nin overall body size. Also, in the context of our findings withtra, loss ofdsx throughout the fat\nbody does not phenocopy the non cell-autonomous effects of loss of Tra on body size. Similar\nto dsx, we found that males lacking FruM expression, or females ectopically expressing FruM\nproteins [44], showed no difference in body size compared to controls (Fig 3D and 3E). We\nnext asked whetherdsx was required for Tra-induced growth. Usingda-GAL4 to overexpress\nTra in adsx mutant background, we found that Tra’s ability to drive body growth was unaf-\nfected by loss ofdsx (Fig 3F). Our results suggest Tra controls growth in a pathway that is inde-\npendent of its effects on sexual differentiation and behaviour.\nIIS, and not TOR, is required for sex differences in body growth\nIn Drosophila, the conserved insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) and Target-of-\nRapamycin (TOR) pathways are two main regulators of tissue and body growth [7, 45, 46].\nBoth pathways play a central role in linking dietary nutrients to regulation of larval metabolism\nand growth [34, 47– 49]. We therefore tested whether IIS/TOR also plays a role in creating sex\ndifferences in body size. We first measured pupal volume in males and females grown in either\nnutrient-rich food (which promotes high levels of IIS/TOR signaling), or in food with reduced\nnutrition (which inhibits IIS/TOR signaling). We found that sex differences in body size were\nabolished in low nutrient conditions (Fig 4A). Since previous studies have shown that IIS/TOR\ncan act in separate pathways to activate downstream effectors [48, 50], we wanted to specifi-\ncally inhibit the TOR pathway, and examine the effects on body size. When we grew larvae on\nfood containing rapamycin, a specific TOR inhibitor, we found an overall reduction in body\nsize in both sexes; however, the SSD between males and female remained at 25% (S7A Fig).\nThus IIS, but not TOR, is required for male-female body size differences. This finding is consis-\ntent with a recent study that showed sex differences in adult body weight were eliminated in\nanimals heterozygous for two hypomorphic mutations in theinsulin receptor(InR) gene [5].\nWe next examined whether we could detect any sex differences in IIS activity during devel-\nopment. The serine/threonine kinase Akt is phosphorylated and activated downstream of IIS.\nMeasuring the ratio of the phosphorylated active form of Akt (P-Akt) to total Akt therefore\nprovides a read-out of IIS activity. When we compared male and female larvae collected 96 hr\nand 120 hr after laying (AEL) at 25°C, we found that females had a significantly higher ratio of\nP-Akt:Akt at 120 hr AEL (S7B and S7C Fig). To further confirm higher IIS activity in females\nduring development, we used an antibody staining in the larval fat body to detect the subcellu-\nlar localization of the transcription factor FOXO. When IIS activity is high, FOXO is phosphor-\nylated by P-Akt, and is evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. When IIS is\ninhibited, FOXO re-localizes to the nucleus, where it regulates expression of its target genes\n[51]. We found the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio of FOXO was significantly higher in males than\ntransformer Regulates Sex Differences in Body Size\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005683 December 28, 2015 7/2 3\nFig 3.

This may be due to additional FOXO-\nindependent factors required for their expression [55,56]. While the differences in IIS we report\nhere are not as dramatic as seen with genetic or starvation-mediated perturbation of IIS, they\nare consistent with females having a modest increase in IIS activity compared to males.\nTra function in the fat body affects ILP release\nTo understand how females achieve a modest increase in IIS compared to males, we examined\ninsulin-like peptide (ILP) expression in larval insulin-producing cells (IPCs). The IPCs express\nthree Drosophila ILPs (dilps 2,3 and 5)[ 57, 58]. Nutrients have been shown to regulate both\nmRNA transcription and secretion of thesedilps [33, 57, 58]. Thus in response to amino acid\ninput to the fat body, an as-yet-unidentified secreted factor is released that acts upon the IPCs\nin the brain to trigger dILP2 and dILP5 release into the larval hemolymph. These dILPs bind to\nthe insulin receptor on target cells to activate IIS and promote body growth. In contrast, when\nnutrient abundance is low, the fat-to-brain signal is reduced and secretion of dILPs is inhibited,\nleading to decreased systemic IIS and body growth. Given our finding that Tra function in the\nfat body is required for normal growth in females, we examined whether Tra expression in the\nfat body influences brain dILPs.\nWe first examined dILP transcript levels and release in wild-type males and females. Using\nqRT-PCR, we found that onlydilp3 transcript levels were different between the sexes, where\nmales had a significant increase indilp3 compared to females (Fig 4B). We next wanted to\ndetermine whether we could detect any differences in dILP secretion. This can be assayed by\nimmunostaining for dILP2 expression in the IPCs. When dILP secretion is high, dILP2 levels\nseen in IPC are low. Conversely, when secretion is decreased, dILP2 levels in the IPCs are\nhigher [33]. When we compared males and females, we found that male IPCs had a signifi-\ncantly higher average pixel intensity with anti-dILP2 (Fig 4C). Sincedilp2 transcript levels are\nnot different between males and females (Fig 4B), this result suggests that dILP2 secretion is\nhigher in females than males.\nGiven the importance of the fat body as a regulator of IPC dILP release, we tested whether\nmale-female differences in dILP2 secretion occur as a result of Tra expression in the female fat\nbody. Usingr4-GAL4, we expressed theUAS-tra2-RNAi transgene to inhibit Tra function spe-\ncifically in the fat body, and measureddilp transcript levels (in the larval carcass that was\ndevoid of fat body), or ILP2 staining intensity in the IPCs. We found that loss of Tra in the fat\nbody did not affect transcript levels ofdilp2, dilp3 or dilp5 in either males or females (S7G Fig).\nHowever, the average pixel intensity of dILP2 staining in the IPCs was significantly higher in\nFig 4.tra function in the fat body regulates male-female differences in dILP2 secretion.(A) Females are normally 30% larger than males in nutrient-rich\n(high IIS/TOR activity); however, in nutrient-poor food, sex differences in body size are abolished (p = 0.082, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD post-\nhoc test). (B) Male and female transcript levels ofinsulin-like peptides 2, 3 and 5(dilp2, dilp3, dilp5) were analyzed in larval carcasses devoid of fat body at\n120 hr AEL at 25°C. Levels ofdilp2 and dilp5 were not different between males and females (p = 0.051, 0.19, Student’s t-test), but levels ofdilp3 were\nsignificantly higher in males (p = 0.0004; Student’s t-test). (C) Males (C’) have significantly higher dILP2 retention in the insulin producing cells (IPCs) in the\nbrain than females (C) (p = 0.001).

(F) Loss oftra significantly reduces body size in females. However, body size intra\nmutant animals that also have loss of one copy of PTEN, a repressor of IIS, rescues the reduced size oftra mutant females, but has no effect ontra mutant\nmales (seeS1 Tablefor complete list of p-values from one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD post-hoc test).

Male dILP2 levels were\nunchanged by loss of Tra function in the fat (Fig 4E). These results suggest that Tra expression\nin the female fat body can enhance levels of dILP secretion compared to males, to control sys-\ntemic insulin signaling and consequently body size.\nTo test this, we measured pupal volume intra mutants in which we genetically increase IIS\nactivity via heterozygous loss of PTEN, a known inhibitor of IIS. We found that loss of one\ncopy of PTEN rescued the decreased body size intra mutant females (Fig 4F). We next wanted\nto test whether a reduction in IIS could suppress the ability of Tra to drive growth. Usingda-\nGAL4 to drive ubiquitous expression of theUAS-tra transgene, we measured body size in larvae\nheterozygous for null or hypomorphic alleles of the InR. This genetic inhibition of IIS blocked\nTra-induced overgrowth (Fig 4G). Together, these results support a model of sex-specific\ngrowth in which Tra function in the female fat body stimulates the release of dILPs from the\nIPC. Higher dILP levels stimulate IIS activity to promote increased body growth in females.\nOverall, our results identify sex determination gene Tra as an additional regulator of the highly\nconserved IIS pathway.\nDiscussion\nIn almost all animals, sex is an important determinant of body size [4]. While sex hormones\nhave been shown to control the rate and duration of growth in mammals to achieve SSD, the\nmechanisms underlying male-female differences in growth in invertebrates are less clear [3,\n59]. We therefore usedDrosophila larvae as a model to study the mechanisms underlying SSD.\nWe identified clear male-female differences in the control of cell and body size that precede the\ndifferentiation of adult sexual morphology (eg. sex combs, abdominal pigmentation, genitalia).\nSince the duration of larval growth does not significantly differ between male and female larvae\n[5], these results implicate the sex-specific regulation of growth as a key determinant of SSD in\nDrosophila. While previous studies showed that master sex determination geneSxl contributes\nto sex differences in body size [23], it was unclear whether these effects on growth were medi-\nated by Sxl’s regulation of the sex determination pathway, or the process of dosage compensa-\ntion. Also, Sxl’s role as a master sex determination gene is not conserved in all insects [60],\nsuggesting other genes may contribute to SSD in these other species.\nIn our study, we show that sex determination genetra contributes to SSD inDrosophila.\nThis suggests that the sex-specific regulation of growth is at least partly independent of dosage\ncompensation, as Tra does not regulate this process [30]. Sincetra’s role in sex determination\nis widely conserved in insects, many of which show SSD, the sex-specific regulation of growth\nby Tra may be a conserved mechanism to create dimorphic body size across many insect spe-\ncies [61, 62]. It is important to note, however, that in spite of our results demonstrating an\nimportant role for Tra in creating SSD inDrosophila, loss of Tra function in females does not\nfully ‘masculinize’ body size, astra mutant females remain significantly larger than wild-type\nmales. There must therefore be other genes that contribute to increased female body size. One\nobvious candidate isSxl, whereSxl mutant females have a male-like body size. Thetra-inde-\npendent effects of sex on body size may therefore be regulated by Sxl. This could occur in one\nof two ways: first, by Sxl acting on targets in addition to Tra, or second, by the effects of Sxl on\ndosage compensation. A recent study by Evans and Cline [63] showed that one female-specific\nbehaviour, ovulation, was controlled by Sxl in atra-independent manner. This‘tra-insufficient\nfeminization’ branch of the pathway does not cause any misregulation of the dosage compensa-\ntion pathway, providing strong evidence that additional, as yet unknown, targets of Sxl mediate\nits effects on ovulation. In the case of SSD, then, other targets of Sxl may explain thetra-inde-\npendent effects of sex on size. In addition to potential targets other thantra, the effects of Sxl\ntransformer Regulates Sex Differences in Body Size\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005683 December 28, 2015 11 / 23\non SSD may alternatively be mediated by its regulation of dosage compensation. In females,\nthe presence of Sxl prevents the activation of the dosage compensation complex, whereas\nabsence of Sxl in males allows dosage compensation to be activated to promote male develop-\nment [11]. Loss of Sxl in females causes the inappropriate activation of this complex. Thus the\ndecreased body size ofSxl mutant females may be explained by the ectopic activation of the\ndosage compensation complex. In the future, it will be interesting to dissect the individual con-\ntributions ofSxl, tra, the dosage compensation complex, and additionalSxl targets, to the con-\ntrol of male-female differences in body size inDrosophila. Further, it will be interesting, where\npossible, to determine whether these genes perform similar roles in SSD in other insect species.\nOne key finding from our work is that sex differences in body growth are regulated by Tra\nindependently of sexual differentiation, behaviour and reproduction. To date, most studies\nhave shown that Tra’s effects on sexual development are mediated by its known targetsdsx and\nfru [43]. Together,dsx and fru regulate most aspects of sexual development and behaviour.\nHowever, our data shows that Tra’s effects on body size are independent ofdsx and fru. Com-\nbined with our data showing that masculinizing or feminizing the gonads or germline has no\neffect on body size, this shows that that sex differences in body size are not simply a conse-\nquence of sexual differentiation, reproduction and behaviour. Instead, SSD inDrosophila is\nregulated by Tra in a separate pathway, separate from other sex determination genes and\naspects of sexual dimorphism. One possible explanation for SSD to be regulated separately of\nother aspects of sexual development is that while increased female body size is an important\nsexual trait, as it is related to fecundity [64], the inability to adjust body size in response to envi-\nronmental factors such as low nutrition can compromise survival during larval life [47]. There-\nfore, unlike aspects of sexual dimorphism that must be fixed to permit reproduction (eg. gonad\nand germline differentiation, female neural circuits for egg-laying), body size must show a\nhigher degree of plasticity. Indeed, studies have shown that male genital discs inDrosophila are\nless sensitive to growth perturbation than other imaginal discs [65]. We therefore propose that\nsexually dimorphic body growth is regulated independently from other aspects of sexual differ-\nentiation to allow body size to be co-ordinated with environmental conditions.\nAnother finding from our work is that Tra function in the fat body can regulate the growth\nof other tissues to influence body size in a non cell-autonomous manner. Previous studies have\nalso identified non cell-autonomous interactions that determine the sex of the genital disc, the\ndevelopment of the male-specific muscle of Lawrence, or sexual dimorphism in the gonad [66–\n69]. Combined with our data that sex differences in body size are also regulated in a non cell-\nautonomous manner, this suggests that inDrosophila, like in mammals, some aspects of sex\ndetermination and sexual dimorphism are regulated in a non cell-autonomous manner. Our\nidentification of sex differences in the secretion of dILP2 suggest that this conservation extends\nto the cell-cell signaling pathways that mediate growth, as sex hormones in mammals are\nknown to control male-female differences in body size via regulation of the growth hormone\n(GH)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) axis [59]. Several recent studies have shown that\nhigher levels of circulating dILPs can increase body growth by augmenting IIS activity [70,71].\nOur findings therefore suggest a model of sex-specific growth inDrosophila in which the sex of\nthe fat body, as determined by the presence (females) or absence (males) of Tra, is one contri-\nbution to the sex differences in body size via regulation of dILP secretion. Higher dILP secre-\ntion in females leads to elevated IIS activity, and consequently an increase in body size. This\nmodel of increased female body size is supported by data that flies lacking all three IPC-derived\ndILPs (dilp2-3,5 triple mutants) show a 40% reduction in body weight in females, but no effect\non body weight in males [72]. Similarly, female body size is more strongly affected than in\nmales in animals with loss-of-function mutations in components of IIS such as\nchico or InR\ntransformer Regulates Sex Differences in Body Size\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005683 December 28, 2015 12 / 23\n[73,74]. Together, these findings highlight the importance of sex as a critical determinant of\ndILP secretion, and IIS-mediated body growth.\nDuring larval development, the fat body responds to a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic cues\nsuch as nutrients and hormones to control body growth. For example, in response to nutrient\ninput, the fat body releases an as-yet-unidentified factor into the larval hemolymph [33]. This\nsecreted factor acts in an endocrine manner to control the release of dILPs from the IPC in the\nbrain. Our studies have identified sex as an additional factor that alters the function of the fat\nbody to influence body growth in a non cell-autonomous manner. In particular, we identified a\nrole for the function of sex determination gene Tra in the fat body as one factor influencing\nSSD in flies. Yet it is unclear how Tra function in the fat body influences the molecular and\nphysiological properties of this tissue to influence body size. Tra is a member of the conserved\nfamily of SR proteins. These proteins play well-characterized roles in the regulation of alterna-\ntive splicing, and have also been shown to influence other aspects of RNA metabolism, such as\nregulation of mRNA translation [75– 77]. Tra may therefore act in two ways in the fat body to\ncontrol dILP2 release: 1) via sex-specific splicing to facilitate production or secretion of the\nsecreted factor(s), or 2) in a more general mechanism by influencing mRNA translation to ele-\nvate production or secretion of these fat-to-brain signals. Although the regulation of dILP\nsecretion is an established mechanism to regulate body growth, the molecules that are released\nby the fat body to control dILP release are only beginning to be identified. For example, the\ncytokine-like moleculeunpaired 2(upd2), and the peptide hormone CCHa2 play roles in cou-\npling fat body function to regulation of dILP secretion and body size [32, 78]. Similarly, Hedge-\nhog was also identified as a factor that can control dILP secretion in an endocrine manner [31].\nIn adults, fat body-derived dILP6 ordawdle, an Activin-like ligand in the TGF-β superfamily,\ncould both influence the secretion of IPC-derived dILPs [79, 80]. In addition, several neuro-\npeptides and neurotransmitters have also been shown to regulate IPC activity and dILP release\n[81]. In the future, it will be interesting to determine whether Tra directly regulates any of\nthese known secreted factors to control dILP2 release. However, an additional possibility is\nthat tra does not directly regulate any secreted factors; instead,tra’s effects on growth may be\nmediated by effects on mRNA translation. Many studies have identified the regulation of\nmRNA translation in the fat body as a limiting factor for growth during development. For\nexample, two studies identified significant effects of TOR and Myc in the fat body in promoting\ndILP release [33, 82]. TOR is an important regulator of mRNA translation, and Myc’s effects\nwere thought to involve elevated levels of ribosome synthesis. A more recent study showed that\nstimulation of tRNA synthesis, and consequently mRNA translation, in the fat body could\ndrive increased body growth [83]. Future studies will allow us to determine which of Tra’s\nmolecular functions (splicing vs. mRNA translation) determine its contribution to fat body\nfunction and consequently growth. Given the increasing awareness of functional similarities\nbetween the fly fat body and mammalian liver/adipose tissue, our results suggest the intriguing\npossibility that the function of these important endocrine organs may be similarly regulated by\nsex to control systemic growth and physiology in mammals.\nIn addition to Tra’s non cell-autonomous effects on body size, we found that Tra also has\ncell- and organ-autonomous effects on size. While our data suggests that Tra’s effects on body\nsize are independent offru and dsx, since loss of neither gene affects overall body growth or\nnon cell-autonomous growth, it is possible that Tra’s cell-autonomous effects on cell size are\nmediated bydsx. In the larval fat body, we identified a cell-autonomous requirement fordsx in\nboth males and females to promote growth in fat body cells. We believe the reason that these\ncell-autonomous effects ofdsx on cell size do not affect overall body size is due to the restricted\nnature of Dsx expression in larvae. Indeed, two studies showed that Dsx expression in larvae is\nlimited to the fat body, CNS, gonads, some regions of the gut, and subsets of imaginal discs\ntransformer Regulates Sex Differences in Body Size\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005683 December 28, 2015 13 / 23\n[37,39]. However, in spite of the lack of effect on overall body size, previous studies inDrosoph-\nila have identified a role fordsx in regulating organ size in other tissues. For example, expres-\nsion of the male- or female-specific isoforms of Dsx (DsxM and DsxF, respectively) control the\nsex-specific growth of the genital disc via Wingless and Decapentaplegic signaling [84]. In\naddition, DsxF has been shown to promote sex-specific programmed cell death in both the lar-\nval ventral nerve cord, and in male-specific gonadal precursor cells [85– 87]. Our findings iden-\ntify an additional mechanism by which Dsx controls organ size: regulation of cell growth.\nWhile the molecular mechanism by which Dsx controls cell size is unclear, Dsx has been\nshown to control horn size in stag beetles by regulating tissue sensitivity to a circulating hor-\nmone, juvenile hormone [88]. Interestingly, a recent paper identified theinsulin receptor(InR)\nand theecdysone receptor(EcR) as potential Dsx targets [89]. Since both pathways have been\nshown to control fat body cell size [47, 82], Dsx may influence fat body cell growth by regulat-\ning tissue sensitivity to circulating dILPs or the steroid hormone ecdysone, integrating signals\nfrom both the primary sex-determining signal (X:A) and circulating hormones to control tissue\ngrowth. In the future, it will be interesting to determine whether the integration of sex and\nenvironmental cues is a general feature of Dsx-mediated tissue growth, or whether this mecha-\nnism is limited to specific tissues, such as the fat body.\nIn conclusion, our studies identify Tra as one regulator of sex differences in growth and\nbody size. Moreover, we provide the first link between Tra and IIS in the control of sex differ-\nences in body growth. Interestingly, sexual dimorphism in phenotypes such as stress resistance,\nimmune responses and lifespan have been noted inDrosophila [90– 95]. These phenotypes are\nalso affected by altering IIS [96– 99]. Tra may therefore control sexual dimorphism in a wide\nvariety of phenotypes via regulation of dILP secretion and IIS activity. Deregulation of insulin\nsecretion and IIS activity have been implicated in diseases such as diabetes and cancer [45,\n100]. Interestingly, sex differences in incidence have been previously reported for both diabetes\nand some forms of cancer [101, 102]. Thus future studies on the link between sex and insulin\nsecretion/IIS activity may explain why one sex is predisposed to these diseases.\nMaterials and Methods\nFly stocks\nLarvae were raised on food at a density of 50 larvae per vial at 25°C [83, 103]. The following fly\nGAL4 stocks were used in this study:da-GAL4, r4-GAL4 (fat body),cg-GAL4 (fat body),elav-\nGAL4 (neurons), repo-GAL4 (glia), P0206-GAL4 (ring gland),Mef2-GAL4 (muscle), Act5c-\nGAL4 (ubiquitous), en-GAL4 (posterior compartment of the wing),nos-GAL4 (germline),\nc587-GAL4 (gonad). We used the following UAS lines:UAS-tra2-RNAi (TriP), UAS-tra2-RNAi\n(VDRC), UAS-tra, UAS-dsx-RNAi (TRiP). The following mutant strains were used:w1118,\nfoxoΔ94, tra1/TM6B, Df(3L)st-j7/TM6B, dsx1/TM6B, Df(3R)dsx15, tud1/CyO::GFP, fruF/TM6B,\nfru4-40/TM6B, fruΔtra/TM6B, pten100;CyO::GFP;MKRS/TM6B. We used the following stocks for\nflp-out experiments:hsflp;;UAS-tra2-RNAi, hsflp;UAS-tra, hsflp;;UAS-dsx-RNAi, act>-\nstop>CD2>stop>GAL4. Larvae were sexed using gonad size. Where gonad size could not be\nused to sex larvae (eg. dsx or tra mutants, da>UAS-tra, Mef2>UAS-tra, Act5c>tra2-RNAi or\nAct5c>UAS-tra), males with a GFP on the X chromosome (Ubiquitin-GFP) were crossed to\nthe virgin females of the correct genotype. In the progeny of the cross, females were GFP-posi-\ntive and males were GFP-negative [5].\nPupal volume\nPupal volume was measured as previously described [82]. n>60 per genotype.\ntransformer Regulates Sex Differences in Body Size\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005683 December 28, 2015 14 / 23\nCell size, compartment size and cell number\nMeasured as previously described [83, 103]. n>40 per genotype.\nAdult weight\nFive-day-old adult flies lacking gonads were weighed in groups of six in 1.5 ml tubes on an ana-\nlytical balance.
