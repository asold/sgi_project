    "abstract": "We have been developing a light weight and high efficiency superconducting traction transformer for railway rolling stock. We designed and fabricated a prototype superconducting traction transformer of a floor-mount type for Shinkansen rolling stock in 2004. We performed the type-test, the system-test, and the vibration-test. Consequently, we could verify that the transformer satisfied the requirement almost exactly as initially planned. However, there have been raised some problems to be solved to put superconducting traction transformer into practical use such that AC loss of the superconducting tape must be lower and the capacity of the refrigerator must be larger. Especially it is the most important to reduce the AC loss of superconducting windings for lightweight and high efficiency. The AC loss must be reduced near the theoretical value of superconducting tape with multifilament. In this study, we fabricated and evaluated the Bi2223 tapes as introduced various measures to reduce the AC loss. We confirmed that the AC loss of the narrow type of Bi2223 tapes with twist of filaments is lower, and we fabricated windings of this tape for use in superconducting traction transformer.",
