Introduction\nThe residual ﬂux within a transformer core not only de-\npends on transformer speciﬁcations but also on transformer\nequipments as a circuit breaker’s grading capacitor and its\nchopping level. Previous work from CIGRE\n(1) reported,\nbased on the simulation result in Refs. (2) (3), that the resid-\nual ﬂux within a no-loaded transformer core can be aﬀected\nby the power ﬂow through a circuit breaker’ grading capaci-\ntor. This paper veriﬁes now the reported phenomena based\non measurements and a mathematical evaluation, because\nan actual dynamic magnetic-current simulation after a trans-\nformer de-energization is very diﬃcult to perform. Further,\nthe residual ﬂux characteristic of diﬀerent transformer sys-\ntems at a varied de-energization instant has to be described\nin order to provide the scientiﬁc information for the devel-\nopment of future controller systems. Therefore, this paper\nprovides de-energization measurements of two transformer\nsystems with a varied grading capacitor and especially points\nout its inﬂuence on controlled transformer switching.\n1.1 Purpose of Grading Capacitances High volt-\nage circuit breakers often uses two or more breaking cham-\nbers in order to reduce dielectric and mechanical stresses\ncompared to a system with only one chamber. Similar ca-\npacitances divide the applied source voltage equally on each\nbreaking chamber. Regarding Ref.

Power ﬂow through the grading capacitances of\na porcelain-type circuit breaker after a transformer deen-\nergization\nbreaking chamber. However the speciﬁcation can vary de-\npending on circuit breaker parameters as the breaking current\nand voltage, the physical dimensions or the breaker type. In\nthat reason grading capacitors up to several thousand Pico-\nFarads [pF] across all chambers have been applied.\nFigure 1 illustrates the power ﬂow through the grading ca-\npacities of a porcelain-type circuit breaker, while a trans-\nformer system is deenergized. The indicated disconnecting\nswitches (DS) can be manually switched and as long as they\ndo not interrupt the power ﬂow, the residual ﬂux characteris-\ntic can be strongly aﬀected—The residual ﬂux level will de-\ncrease and oscillations around this ﬂux level can be observed.\n1.2 Steady State and Residual Flux Characteristic\nA transformer core’s magnetic ﬂux is characterized by the\nmagnetic ﬂux density B, which depends on the transformer\ncore’s magnetismM as well as on the applied ﬁeldH—The\nmagnetism M depends itself on the applied ﬁeldH as can be\nc⃝2010 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. 484\nInﬂuence of Grading Capacitors on Controlled Transformer Switching\nFig. 2.

A fer-\nromagnetic transformer core exhibits a nonlinear, hysteretic\npermeability, which can be characterized by a hysteresis\nloop\n(5). In practice the hysteresis loop is often deﬁned by the\ncurrent I and the magnetic ﬂuxΦinstead of the applied ﬁeld\nH and the magnetic ﬂux densityB, because Φand I can be\nmeasured. Eqs. (2) and (3) deﬁne the relationship betweenΦ\nand B and betweenI and H: The magnetic ﬂuxΦis equal to\nthe area integral of the magnetic ﬂux densityB and the mea-\nsurable current corresponds to the applied ﬁeldH multiplied\nby the number of winding turns and divided by the length of\nthe windings.\nΦ=\n∫\nA\nBdA ···································· (2)\nI =H ·l\nn ······································· (3)\nFigure 2 illustrates an exemplary steady state hystere-\nsis measurement of a 50 kV A single phase transformer\n(6.6 kV:210 V), whereby one cycle within the loop corre-\nsponds to one period of the applied source voltage. During\nsteady-state conditions a transformer is often used up to its\nsaturation level and will therefore pass the full hysteretic am-\nplitude of the magnetic ﬂuxΦ. At the hysteresis loop’s cur-\nrent zero crossing the remanent ﬂuxR\nm can be measured and\nIC is the coercive force(6).\nAfter a transformer deenergization oscillations around the\nresidual ﬂux level (micro oscillations) will appear that de-\npend on the deenergization instant and therefore on the actual\nposition at the steady-state hysteresis loop. In Fig. 3 it can\nbe observed that the frequency of the micro oscillations cor-\nresponds to the frequency of supply during the steady state\nconditions and the center of these micro oscillations is de-\nﬁned as the residual ﬂux level. It is widely accepted that the\nresidual ﬂux is “locked” within a transformer core and does\nFig. 3. An exemplary residual ﬂux measurement after a\ntransformer deenergization: A ﬂux decay, micro oscilla-\ntions and the residual ﬂux level can be observed\nnot change over time, unless there are external inﬂuences(1).\nUnder this assumption the residual ﬂux level and the micro\noscillations determine the next re-energization conditions.\nThe decay in Fig. 3, from the ﬂux level at the de-\nenergization instant to the residual ﬂux level, is a very dif-\nﬁcult parameter to estimate without any measurement—A\nPreisach model have been applied in Ref. (7). Therefore, the\nﬂux value is typically obtained by integral of the measured\ntransformer terminal voltage\n(8).\n2. Preliminary Evaluation of a Grading Capaci-\ntance’s Inﬂuence on the Residual Flux\nTypical transformer models have been summarized in\nRef. (9). A simpliﬁed transformer model is considered for\nthe preliminary evaluation of a grading capacitor’s inﬂuence\non the residual ﬂux characteristic. In Fig. 4 it is illustrated\nthat the model contains of a linear transformer capacitance\nC\nT , a linear core loss represented byR and a linear induc-\ntive transformer reaction after the de-energization instant in-\ndicated byL.\nI\nS corresponds to the measurable current from the sec-\nondary transformer windings. In case of a no-loaded, single-\nphase transformer I\nS as well as IP can be considered to be\nzero. In that reason the currentI summates the approximated\ninductive current through L, the capacitive current through\nCT as well as the resistive current throughR (10).A f t e r t h e\ntransient deenergization process, the transformer’s pole to\nground voltagevcan be calculated by a phasor-analysis, re-\ngarding a sinusoidal sourceV\nSource.

(8) the ﬂux is typically approximated\nby the voltage integral and therefore the micro oscillation am-\nplitude as illustrated in Fig. 3 corresponds to the magnitude\nof the integrated voltagev. Regarding Eq. (6) it can be con-\ncluded that the amplitude of the micro oscillations have to\nincrease for a larger grading capacitance.\n࿦ Bɼ130ר5ɼ2010 ೥ 485\nFig. 4.

In that reason a non-linear hys-\nteresis loop as illustrated in Fig. 2 should be considered. So\nfar no analytic expression of the hysteretic inductance after a\ncircuit breaker’s breaking point could be found in literature,\nbut transient simulation programs as ATP/EMTP will apply\na piecewise linear, hysteretic inductance depending on the\ndeenergization instant and its position in the steady state hys-\nteresis loop.

Therefore only the homogeneous so-\nlution without any source voltage is calculated. Considering\nthe start conditions in Eq. (10), the voltagev(t) can be calcu-\nlated as in Eq. (11). Generally, the circuit breaker’s breaking\npoint is not always at the breaking point and therefore an ad-\nditional cosine function multiplied with an exponential term\nwould be added to Eq. (11).

If the grading capacitance in\nEq. (13) is increased, the residual ﬂux level will decrease, be-\ncause the factork is negative in case of the start conditions in\nEq. (10). More transient energy will pass through the over-\nall transformer capacitance and the residual ﬂux, represent-\ning the energy “locked in the transformer core”, will become\nsmaller.\n3. Single-Phase Transformer Measurements\n3.1 Transformer Measurements The previous chap-\nter analytically evaluated the inﬂuence of a grading capaci-\ntance on the residual ﬂux characteristic: With an increased\ngrading capacitance, the residual ﬂux level will decrease\nand the amplitude of the micro oscillations will become\nlarger. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate these phenomena by deen-\nergization measurements of two single phase transformers.\nBoth systems are 50 kV A transformers with a voltage ra-\ntio of 6.6 kV to 210 V , but they have been made by diﬀer-\nent manufacturers—One system was a core and the other a\n486 IEEJ Trans.

Deenergization of a 50 kV A, 6.6 kV:210 V ,\nsingle-phase transformer (B) at 162 degree of the mea-\nsured voltage; The ﬂux is the integral of the measured\nvoltage\nshell-type transformer. Interruptions were performed by a\ngas circuit breaker. The deenergization instant was in case\nof transformer A at 145 degree of the measured voltage. For\ntransformer B the deenergization point of time was at 162\ndegree of the measured voltage. Due to mechanical scat-\nter, errors of (+/−) 2 degree from the deenergization point\nof time are included in the measurements of Figs. 5 and 6.\nIn Fig. 5 at 0.5 seconds: It can be observed that for a grad-\ning capacitance of 2600 pF the residual ﬂux level is 0.2 [p.u.],\nwhile a grading capacitance of 450 pF leads to a residual ﬂux\nlevel of 0.52 [p.u.]. In contrary the micro oscillation ampli-\ntude for a grading capacitance of 2600 pF is 0.16 [p.u.] and\nfor a grading capacitance of 450 pF it is 0.01 [p.u.]. The same\ndeenergization behavior of the residual ﬂux can be seen in-\nside the steady state hysteresis loop—The micro oscillations\naround the residual ﬂux level have been combined with the\ncorresponding current measurements. Figure 7 illustrates the\nmicro hysteresis of transformer A for the same deenergiza-\ntion measurements as in Fig. 5. The residual ﬂux decay can\nbe very well observed as well as the micro oscillations, which\nstabilizes around a residual ﬂux level.\nAs a next step the deenergization instant was varied for\nthe diﬀerent values of the grading capacitance. Each of this\nmeasurement can be plotted as dot in a two dimensional area\nFig. 7.

Figs. 9, 10 illustrates\nsuch a plot for the two transformer systems A and B. In ad-\ndition, the dots of each grading capacitor have been approxi-\nmated by a median.\n3.2 Discussion of the Measurements The inﬂuence\nof a grading capacitor on the residual ﬂux can be very well\nobserved in the measurements of Figs. 5 and 6. Additionally,\nin Figs. 8 and 9 it is illustrated that the ratio between the mi-\ncro oscillation amplitude and the residual ﬂux level is almost\nconstant at any de-energization instant. Figures 8 and 9 show\nas well that this ratio is determined by the grading capacitor.\nFor a larger grading capacitor the ratio increases, because the\nmicro oscillation amplitude increases relatively more then the\nresidual ﬂux decreases.\nEven if the measurements in Figs. 5 and 6 represent not\nexactly the same deenergization instant, it can be observed\nthat the inﬂuence of the applied grading capacitor on the\nresidual ﬂux characteristic was smaller in case of transformer\n࿦ Bɼ130ר5ɼ2010 ೥ 487\nA. Regarding that both transformers A and B are 50 kV A,\n6.6 kV:210 V systems, the linearly approximated transformer\ncapacitance C\nT might be assumed as equal. Therefore, the\ndiﬀerence can be referred to the transient inductive behav-\nior L and the core lossR of the preliminary evaluated trans-\nformer model as illustrated in Fig. 4. Section 2 explains step\nby step that several assumptions have been taken in order to\nanalytically evaluate the residual ﬂux and therefore for an ex-\nact evaluation of the residual ﬂux, a numerical evaluation of\na more detailed model should be considered. However, the\nanalytically evaluated Eqs. (6) and (13) can come up with an\neasy to use and straightforward approximation of the micro\noscillation amplitude as well as the residual ﬂux level. Ap-\nplying these calculations on transformer A, the system can be\nparameterized by the following values:C\nT =900 [pF],L =\n1600 [H] andR =150 [kΩ]. The calculations have been ap-\nproximated for the same de-energization instant as the mea-\nsurements in Fig. 5.

Inﬂuence on Controlled Transformer Switch-\ning\n4.1 Switching Theories Hysteresis loops as illus-\ntrated in Figs. 2 and 10 indicate at the current-ﬂux peak the\nsaturation characteristic of the hysteresis loops. Regarding\nthat during steady-state condition a transformer is usually\nused up to its saturation level, the energization instant of a no-\nloaded transformer systems becomes important. A complete\nrandom energization can lead to very large inrush currents.\nSeveral controlled switching strategies, taking into account\nthe residual ﬂux level within a transformer core, have been\ndeﬁned in order to reduce these inrush currents\n(11)–(13) .T h e\noptimal re-energization target is when the prospective ﬂux\nfrom the source side is identical to the residual ﬂux. If the\nresidual ﬂux level at the re-energization instant does not cor-\nrespond to the ﬂux from the source side, the superimposed\nﬂux inside the transformer core will drift into the saturation\ncharacteristic and inrush currents will occur.\n4.2 Eﬀect of the Grading Capacitor on Inrush Cur-\nrents An exemplary, optimal re-energization of a single-\nphase transformer system is illustrated in Fig. 11. The os-\ncillations after the de-energization instant are based on the\npower ﬂow through the circuit breakers grading capacitances.\nIn addition, the ﬂux decay can be observed as well. Figure 12\nenlarges the re-energization instant of Fig. 11 and regarding\nthe deﬁnition of the optimal re-energization target, several\ncrossings of the prospective ﬂux from the source and the\nresidual ﬂux would fulﬁll this condition. However, the opti-\nmal re-energization targets for a circuit breaker with grading\ncapacitor diﬀer to a circuit breaker without grading capacitor\nand future transformer systems have to consider these phe-\nnomena.\n4.3 Line Faults After a Transformer Deenergization\nIf a power ﬂow through the grading capacitances is en-\nabled, line faults and its clearing operation inﬂuence the\nresidual ﬂux level and therefore the optimal re-energization\ntarget of a no-loaded transformer as well—An exemplary\nmeasurement is illustrated in Fig. 13.\nThe line fault causes a transient reaction containing high\nFig. 11.

Exemplary optimal re-energization targets;\nSquares for a circuit breaker without a grading capacitor,\ncircles for of a transformer system switched by a circuit\nbreaker with grading capacitor\nFig. 13. Exemplary line failure after a transformer deen-\nergization by a circuit breaker equipped with a grading\ncapacitor\nfrequencies, which will aﬀect the residual ﬂux level. In ad-\ndition, after the immediate instant of the line fault, the micro\noscillations will disappear, because the energy of the source\nwill divert into fault. The remaining residual ﬂux level and\nthe induced ﬂux of the micro oscillation might cross each\nother during the instant of the fault clearing. In that reason\nthe residual ﬂux level can be decreased or increased by up\nto two times the amplitude of the micro oscillations. In the\nexample of Fig. 13 the resulting residual ﬂux level was de-\ncreased, based on these two phenomena, from 42% to 38%\nof the magnetic ﬂux peak. The decay will aﬀect the optimal\nenergization target as described in the previous chapter.\n5. Conclusion and Outlook\nThe investigation on the ﬂux behavior could reveal the in-\nﬂuence of a grading capacitor on the residual ﬂux by mea-\nsurements and mathematical analysis: A larger grading ca-\npacitor increases the micro oscillation’s amplitude and de-\ncreases the residual ﬂux. The ratio between these phenom-\nena have been measured as constant at any de-energization\ninstant and therefore mainly depend on the grading capacitor\nand the hysteretic characteristic of a transformer core. These\ntwo phenomena will become strong for a comparably large\ngrading capacitor. The residual ﬂux behavior will directly af-\nfect the optimal re-energization targets of a no-loaded trans-\nformer system, because the locked in residual ﬂux can not\nanymore be assumed as stable.\nAs a next step the eﬀect of a 3-phase transformer connec-\ntion on these phenomena shall be evaluated. Further, a de-\ntailed investigation on the residual ﬂux behavior can improve\nthe residual ﬂux estimation and might provide a sophisticated\ntransformer model used for controlled switching analysis.\n(Manuscript received July 29, 2009,\nrevised Dec. 11, 2009)\nReferences\n( 1 ) CIGRE Working Group A3.07: “Controlled Switching of Unloaded Power\nTransformers”, ELECTRA, V ol.39, No.212, pp.45–46 (2004)\n( 2 ) E.
