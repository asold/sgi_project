  "abstract": "This paper presents the development and implementation of a coupled electromagnetic transformer model for the simulation of three-phase power and distribution transformers affected by the presence of winding inter-turn short-circuits. Generically, the coupled electromagnetic transformer model is based on the simultaneous consideration of both magnetic and electric equivalent circuits. To incorporate the internal faults in this model a suitable equivalent circuit of the faulty winding is proposed. Both simulation and laboratory tests results are presented in the paper, which demonstrate the adequacy of the proposed model.",
