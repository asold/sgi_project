The global \npool of talent is shrinking (Botha, Buss in, de Swartd 2011) . Attracting high quality \napplicants becomes rather challenging in the recent years. Companies with better \nreputation attract more and higher quality of candidates (Turban and Cable 2003). \nEmploying the right candidates does not limit on ly to placing the advertis ement and \noffering relevant pay. C ompanies try to develop their image as an “employer of \nchoice”, the one who employee wants to work for . So employer branding became an \nimportant part of company long term strategy.  There is a numb er of research that \ndemonstrates that employer brand strongly influence the attractiveness of the \ncompany to prospective employees (Minchington,2010; Crous, 2007; Willock 2005). \nDue to the talent shortage ability to attract skilled employees and retaining talents is \none of the main factors strengthening competitive advantage on the market (Hallen \n2007, Prinsloo 2008; Mohaptra 2005) as talent shortage make companies vulnerable \nand less sustainable (Minchington, 2006; Prinsloo, 2008).  \nWhen looking for a job  recruits often consider several firms and use corporate \nreputation as a source of information about working environment, company culture \nand job prospects. \nEmployer branding promotes and profiles the company to potential employees. This \nrequires creating and communicating compelling and unique perception of company in \nthe minds of both prospective recruits to attract them and current employees to retain \nthem. Any organization that want s to build its competitiveness o n the market \nconsciously, should also build its brand of “employer of choice”. \nEmployer brand of specific organization is determined by such factors as: \nattractiveness of the sector, company‟s reputation, quality of products and service, \nlocation, work environment, pay, economic conditions, em ployee benefits, people and \nculture, work/life balance . Company needs to shape its image consciously to be able \nto influence on how it is perceived as an employer. \nThe objective of this paper is to present the preliminary results of investigating \nexternal tools of employer branding used by energy companies listed on the Warsaw \nStock Exchange. This paper will look at which external employer branding tools are \nmostly used by energy sector companies‟ listed at Warsaw Stock Exchange to attract \ngraduates. It also investigate similarities and differences within this sector.  \n29 May 2017, 8th Economics & Finance Conference, London ISBN 978-80-87927-38-0 , IISES\n201http://www.iises.net/proceedings/8th-economics-finance-conference-london/front-page\nWhat is it employer branding? \nEmployer branding is a growing field and the  concept has been defined in several \nways. Employer branding was first ly defined by Ambler and Barrow(1996), who \nclaimed that an employer brand is a package of functional, economic and \npsychological benefits provided by employment, and identified with the employing \ncompany.  \nAccording to Sehgal and Malati (2013) employer branding is the image of an \norganisation that is perceived by stakeholders, shareholders and employees. It should \nshow the uniqueness of the firm, allow to differentiate from competitors and encourage \nemployees that the company is a good place to work at. Lloyd (2002) emphasises that \nemployer branding comprises of various company efforts to communicate to exis ting \nand upcoming employees as a  desirable place to work  at. Employer branding is a \npromise given to current and prospective employees. \nOne of the most important factors that influence recruits dec ision of which company \napply to is their perception of company brand (Turban and Cable 2003, Highhouse et \nal 1999) . CIPD research shows that for 75% of companies the employer branding \nhelps with making recruitment process effective (Dyer,2007)  \nMark and Toelken (2009) as well as Wheeler et al. (2006) emphasised that employer \nbranding strategies should be aligned with overall company brand and company \nstrategy. Employer branding becoming long term company strategy to manage the \nperception of current and pro spective employees  and related stakeholders about \nparticular firm (Sullivan 2004). \nHudson (2014) reports shows that almost 63% of the 324 largest World businesses \ndefined employer branding in their strategies and undertake activities related to this \narea. In addition research conducted in 2011 by LinkedIn indicated that there are three \nreasons to develop good employer branding concept (Linkedin,2012): \n spending less on hiring – it can lower by 50% per hire the company cost, \n boosting retention - it can reduce employee turnover by up to 28%, \n influencing candidates decision. \n \n29 May 2017, 8th Economics & Finance Conference, London ISBN 978-80-87927-38-0 , IISES\n202http://www.iises.net/proceedings/8th-economics-finance-conference-london/front-page\nThe principles of employer branding \nEmployer branding is nowadays perceived as a necessary part of long -term strategy. \nIt should help to manage the awareness and perceptions of employees, potential \nemployees, and related stakeholders with regard to particular organisations.  \nThere are two main models of employer branding strategy (Kantowicz-Gdańska2009)  \n Martin‟s model – employer branding is a process used to create company image. \nIt is determined by corporate identity and deeply embedded in organisational \nculture. The company image is basis of firm reputation that attracts employees. \n Backhouse and Tikoo‟s model  – employer branding is a group of functional, \neconomic and psychological benefits provided by employment, and identified with \nthe employing company. It establishes the identity of the firm as an employer. It \ncomprises of company value system, policies and behaviours that can attract \nmotivate, and retain the firm‟s current and potential employees (Backhaus & \nTikoo, 2004). \nAccording to ManpowerGroup (2015)  there are eight essential factors in developing \neffective employer branding strategy: \n Be Candidate Centric  – company need to use marketing tools in their recruiting \nprocesses. They should use customized approaches that will engage applicants in \nways they are not being engaged before. Company need to understand \ncandidates‟ unique motivators, needs and life stages etc. \n Be Authentic  - emotional connection with candidates is vital as separates one \nemployer from another. Trust brand ambassadors with social media, don‟t try to \ninfluence their voice as contrived or forced messages  as it will seem inauthentic \nand could harm good employer brand. \n Be consistent – the employer brand should have consistent tone and core values \nthroughout the whole process. The objective and message should be clear to all \nparties that supporting the process to avoid “bait and switch” perception. \n Be informed – companies need to be aware of what is being said about them – \ngood and bad – true and untrue as this create recruits perceptions about \ncompany. The company should continuously monitor and assess all the t ools that \nare available like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Glassdoor, Get Rated! etc as they \nhave real influence in the marketplace. \n Be creative – employers need to make sure that their job descriptions are up to \ndate and reflect  current trends on the marke t. They should reflect why the \n29 May 2017, 8th Economics & Finance Conference, London ISBN 978-80-87927-38-0 , IISES\n203http://www.iises.net/proceedings/8th-economics-finance-conference-london/front-page\ncompany is the best choice, why it is good to be employed by them and stay \nthere. Companies should use innovative approaches such as employee \nambassadors‟ videos of daily workplace activity or their testimonials. Company \nshould have clear and efficient strategy how efficiently use \nEmployment/Career/Work section of the company‟s website. \n Be proactive – company should continuously nurture talent communities before i \nneeds to fill vacancies as this will allow company to secure re al competitive \nadvantage for attracting best talents when new position arise. \n Be reactive – if employer spot any negative reviews/opinion about the firm the \nissues arising should be follow up and then rectified. The positive reviews give an \nopportunity to provide deeper insight into company values and how it reinforces \nthe EVP1. \n Be bold – employer reputation is increasingly being formed online often by factors \nthe company have a little control over. So employers should be proactive and \nclosely monitor marketplace dynamics. \n \nTypes of employer branding \nCompanies can build employers brand in different . In practice, employer branding is \nmost frequently divided into internal branding and external branding (Kozłowski, 2012)  \nInternal employer branding is primarily focused on creating a friendly work atmosphere \nand a possibility of employees‟ development inside the organisation. It is directed \nprimarily to existing and leaving employees and  focus on developmental programs \nand building a well -defined corporate culture . Firms try to build good employee \nexperience and turn them into brand advocates. This is extremely important as \ntalented recruits conduct thorough research about th e prospective employer by \nspeaking with employees of the company.  \nExternal employer branding is directed to professionals, students, graduates and other \nstakeholders. It is executed by using modern communication channels, building \nrelations with the acad emic community, co -operation with opinion -leading media, \nimage-enhancing recruitment projects etc. It concentrates on creating strong company \nvisibility on the target ed talent markets by designing  complex approach including \nwebsites with content on the com pany culture, compensation  and benefit  practices \nand career opportunities and why they are  a great company to work for. If external \nbranding is expected to be successful it requires dissemination of the relevant, reliable \nmessage on the market . External em ployer branding may perform two functions . \nFirstly image-creating function that aims at increasing candidates‟ awareness of the \n                                                           \n1 Employee Value Proposition \n29 May 2017, 8th Economics & Finance Conference, London ISBN 978-80-87927-38-0 , IISES\n204http://www.iises.net/proceedings/8th-economics-finance-conference-london/front-page\nbrand, informing the job market of the company and the advantages of working in it, \npresenting the competitive advantage or impl ementing the corporate social \nresponsibility principles. Secondly recruitment-oriented function whose most important \nobjective is finding the most appropriate candidates and  influencing them to apply for \nthe available vacancies. \nWhen assessing prospective employer recruits look for (Simmons, 2009): \n Recruitment and selection procedures, \n Job role, competitive compensation and benefits, job satisfaction, \n Challenging, stimulating and fulfilling work environment, \n Health and safety,  \n Training and development,  \n Contribution to societal well being, \n Employer brand value proposition, \n Work life balance. \nAs stress by Shah (2011) external branding only achieve its  results if it is  able to \ncreate positive experience for employees (positive internal branding). \nRegardless of the chosen approach, employer branding requires involving employees \nat all levels of the organisational structure in the process so that the employer's brand \ncould reflect the actual aspirations and challenges of all managers and employees. \nThe values which are included or which will be included in the brand have to comprise \ninformation related to organisational culture, management styles, expectations of \ncurrent employees and future recruits. This will help in developing group of values \noffered by a company to its employees (Backhaus, Tikoo, 2004). \n \nEmployer Branding Tools \nThe fast growing development of social media made it very attractive to employers as \na way to disseminate information about their brand, values and opportunities to \nprospective recrui ts. Every month over two million jobs are posted via social media \nmainly on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter Kaur et al. (2015) . It is quick, easy a nd wildly \naccessible for substantial public. Internet search has been broadly use by candidates \nas well as the Human Resource Department. \n29 May 2017, 8th Economics & Finance Conference, London ISBN 978-80-87927-38-0 , IISES\n205http://www.iises.net/proceedings/8th-economics-finance-conference-london/front-page\nSocial media become essential element of company talent management strategy \n(Kaur 2015 et al.). In recent years the use of social media for recruitment and \nscreening candidates significantly increased (Clark and Roberts 2010). Kaur et \nal.(2015) stressed that using social media for employer branding has two sides and it  \ncan be a boom or  bane depending how it is used, so c ompanies need to closely \nmonitor information that are posted online. \nCurrently some of the most ly used approache s in employer branding are \n(ManpowerGroup, 2015); \n Talent Communities - group of people who may not be quite ready to apply for a job \nor for which there is no appropriate position open. Prospective candidates may try \nto stretch their skills in order to qual ify for a vacancy. Talent communities leverage \nthat behaviour. Community members may include entry-level job seekers as well as \nthose of u pper-management positions. C ompany need s to comm unicate with \ncommunity members on continues basis and keep them engage d and demonstrate \nthat the company is an employer of choice, whether or not they are actively job \nseeking. It allows company to build and maintain a robust cluster of talent before \nthe need arises. It also presents an opportunity to better understand and p rofile \ntalent for future opportunities. \n Employer Ambassadors – involving employees as brand ambassadors. It requires \nfinding engaged employees to speak out about the company and the workplace. \nThis can be one of the most effective and cost -efficient recruiting tools available. \nProspective applicants are more likely to find employee peer experiences more \ncredible than many other sources of information.  \n Gamification - employers are increasingly looking to games and new technology as \na means of immersing people in real-life challenges that demonstrate their job skills \nand simultaneously engage candidates with the employer. Some companies hire \ngame developers within their recruitment budgets.  \n Social Media - proactive companies encourage employees to use social  media, \nhowever this strategy should be carefully introduced and involves some training on \nwhat is expected in terms of tone, content and overall appropriateness.  \nAll this tools are available to Polish companies, however the most frequently used \nwhen developing an employer branding strategy  are preparing talent management \nand development programme, defining EVP, developing a communication strategy of \nthe employer's brand, including a separate „career‟ page or a „career‟ tab on the \ncompany's website, develo ping social media strategy, remuneration strategy , \nreference programmes for employees, an effective le adership development \nprogramme (HRM INSTITUTE, 2016). \n \n29 May 2017, 8th Economics & Finance Conference, London ISBN 978-80-87927-38-0 , IISES\n206http://www.iises.net/proceedings/8th-economics-finance-conference-london/front-page\nResearch methodology  \nThe aims of this research is to investigate the use of external employer bran ding tools \nby selected companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW).

They \nalso offer on-line application process. \n Most of the companies offers not only graduate roles, bu t also work experience, \ninternships and placements. \n The scope of the description of the recruitment process presented to applicants \nvaries, with some companies showing very detailed information about various \nrecruitments stages (including graphs).  \n All companies have “Career/Job” Page as a Tab on the company homepage. \n All surveyed companies participate in job fairs, as they believe that this is the  \nfastest and most effective communication channel with prospective applicants. \nThey also regard job fairs as a great opportunity to create a database of \nprospective job applicants .

This is in line with research conducted by Kaur et al \n(2015). \n \nConclusion \nEmployer branding concept has evolved from a novelty and solution originally \naddressed only to large businesses to one of the tools used nowadays to build \ncompetitive advantage and oriented towards attracting the most talented candidates, \nas well as a method of limiting fluctuation of key employee.  \n29 May 2017, 8th Economics & Finance Conference, London ISBN 978-80-87927-38-0 , IISES\n211http://www.iises.net/proceedings/8th-economics-finance-conference-london/front-page\nThe content analysis reveals that in energy sector companies use similar e xternal \nemployer branding tools to attract talents such as social media, job fairs, companies‟ \nwebsites.  However the collaboration with universities still follows the  old fashion \napproach of mainly guest lectures. So  there is no proper partnership between  \ncompanies and Universities. More interactive approaches such as brand \nambassadors, on Campus designates events or open days are still very rare. \n \nReferences \nAmbler T., S.
