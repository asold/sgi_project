Indeed, the very\nnotion of tool use itself implies the appropriation of an object\n(external to the organism) from the environment. More impor-\ntantly though, the purpose of tool use generally is to extend one’s\nability to effect change upon the environment ( Leroi-Gourhan,\n1964; Baber, 2006 ). Any instance of tool use behavior should\ntherefore be regarded primarily as a goal directed action and thus\ncan only be effectively evaluated in relation to the demands of the\nsituation or task at hand ( Bril et al., 2010; Nonaka et al., 2010 ).\nDetermining the efﬁcacy of a tool use action however, is not as\nsimple as it may appear. Like most other motor tasks, an effective\ntool use action may be generated using a multitude of differ-\nent postural combinations (refer to Figure 1). The question of\nhow the brain goes about choosing one particular movement is\na central theme in the study of motor control and is commonly\nreferred to as the motor equivalence problem ( Bernstein, 1967 ).\nIn effect, successful achievement of the desired outcome in any\nmotor problem requires only that the actor satisfy the constraints\nof the task at hand. It is thus the mechanics of the task that\nimpose the characteristics of the action ( Bril et al., 2009, 2010 ).\nAdaptive behavior then emerges as the nervous system learns to\nexploit the mechanical properties that exist in the different body-\nenvironment conﬁgurations ( Bernstein, 1967; Chiel and Beer,\n1997).\nWhen compared with other motor tasks though, the distin-\nguishing feature of tool use behavior is the incorporation (by\nthe actor) of an external device in order to mediate the physical\ninteraction constitutive of the goal ( Preston, 1998; Bongers et al.,\n2004; Baber, 2006 ). It is a permutation that effectively entails\nseveral consequences. On one hand, the introduction of the tool\nadds greater complexity to the existing body-environment system.\nAnd beyond the evident addition of the physical characteristics\nof the tool itself, each and any variation of the tool’s relation-\nship to the body and to the environment may have signiﬁcant\nrepercussions upon task performance ( van Leeuwen et al., 1994;\nBongers et al., 2004 ). In purely mechanical terms, introducing a\ngreater number of degrees of freedom to the system necessitates\nmore sophisticated methods of control. On the other hand, mod-\nifying the dynamics of the system can afford potential beneﬁts,\nnot the least of which may be greater precision or mechanical\nadvantage. In this respect, tool use may be considered a game of\nfunctional dynamics, of learning and mastering a complex system\nof mechanical conditions in a body-task-environment interaction\nto the desired effect ( Roux et al., 1995; Smitsman, 1997 ).\nThe ability to perceive and manage varying complexity of\nphysical interactions is thus fundamental. It deﬁnes adaptive tool\nuse behavior. Remarkably though, very few studies of tool use\nplace emphasis upon these phenomena as part of their experi-\nmental design, focusing rather on action plans and neural rep-\nresentations. Frequently, studies on tool use behavior have either\nsought to eliminate the need for subjects to negotiate the physical\ninteractions for which that tool is conceived, (e.g., pantomime,\nnaming, or recognition of tools, observing tool action, imagin-\ning tool use) or otherwise signiﬁcantly reduced the degrees of\nfreedom existing between actor and tool (see among others Choi\net al., 2001; Kellenbach et al., 2003; Johnson-Frey et al., 2005;\nLewis, 2006; Goldenberg et al., 2007; Stout et al., 2008; Peeters\net al., 2009, 2013; Ramayya et al., 2010; Massen and Sattler, 2012 ).\nImportantly, several recent papers have confronted the cogni-\ntive processes involved in understanding the physical interactions\nwww.frontiersin.org April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 1\n\nParry et al. Functional dynamics in tool use\nFIGURE 1 | In order to successfully learn goal directed actions, the\nactor must learn the functional dynamics of the task.Whilst different\nmovements or tools may be used, each person is obliged to learn how\nbody-object-environment relationships combine to satisfy task constraints.\nIn these examples, the weight of the box (mass× gravity), indicated by the\nwhite arrow remains constant. The force applied by the actor (indicated\nhere by the red arrow) may however vary as conditions change.(A) In the\nexample of lifting a box, an individual may use any number of postural\ncombinations. Successfully lifting the box requires only that the person\ngenerates enough force to overcome the mass of the box with the\ncombined effect of gravity.(B) Upon introduction of a simple tool such as a\nlever, the dynamics of the task change considerably.(C) Adjusting\nrelationships between tool-person-environment conﬁgurations may\nsigniﬁcantly change functional dynamics of the situation. Here this may be\ndue to adjusting the location of the load and pivot, or alternatively by\nincreasing the size of the lever.\ninvolved in tool use. In examples of clinical studies, Goldenberg\nand Hagmann (1998) and Hodges et al. (1999) proposed that a\nform of “mechanical reasoning” may support functional tool use,\nenabling an individual to determine appropriate actions by means\nof comparison between structural properties of the objects (both\ntool and target material) with respect to task demands. More\nrecently, Osiurak et al. (2009) expanded upon this work using\nthe notion of “technical reasoning”—a capacity that presents\nas being distinct from those involved in object representation.\nIn all cases though, the basis of these types of mechanical rea-\nsoning processes have been examined in the context of tool\nselection or by classiﬁcation of the action demonstrated (e.g.,\ncorrect/incorrect; object error/action error). As yet these stud-\nies have not yet been extended to include the use of quan-\ntitative evaluation (by means of kinetic analysis, for example)\nof subject ability to control the physical interactions critical to\nthe task.\nUndoubtedly, these technical and mechanical reasoning\nframeworks above have proven themselves to be rather informa-\ntive, most notably in the study of apraxia. Still, the interest of these\nmodels has been found primarily in their utility for determin-\ning the roles played by the various cognitive processes involved\nin tool use ( Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009; Osiurak et al., 2009 ).\nIndeed for the most part in tool use research, the human ability to\nengage in complex tool use has been perceived predominantly as\na function of cognitive capacity. The overwhelming prevalence of\nresearch methods focused primarily upon cognitive and cerebral\nactivity does seem to be somewhat at odds with the problematic\nitself. After all, unlike certain other skills that frequently occur as\nexclusively internal cognitive processes (e.g., planning, recall, or\narithmetic), tool use does not “happen in the brain.” The tool use\naction itself may be seen to embody the actor’s capacity to per-\nceive relevant stimulus and coordinate an efﬁcient response with\nrespect to the situation at hand ( Preston, 1998; Baber, 2006; Bril\net al., 2009 ). As such, functional approaches to the analysis of tool\nuse behavior may provide particularly rich information regarding\nthe cognitive abilities of actor ( Bril et al., 2009 ).\nAccordingly, it is imperative to recognize that that locus of\ncontrol does not rest exclusively in the brain. Effective tool use\nnecessitates organization across an exceptionally intricate system\nspanning both the central and peripheral nervous systems. More\nthan just a question of internal representation, adaptive tool use\nis equally a question of dexterity ( Bernstein, 1996 ). To focus\nexclusively upon mechanisms for transforming sensory represen-\ntations of the body and environment into motor programs is thus\ninsufﬁcient for explaining the complexity of tool use behavior.\nMoreover, the division made between cognitive and motor aspects\nof performance implied by such methods appears to be more an\nacademic convenience than a physiological reality ( Newell, 1991;\nSummers and Anson, 2009 ). Indeed, the very notion of the motor\nprogram, though an ever-present paradigm in both research and\nclinical perspectives, is obscure at best and no real consensus\nexists on whether it should be regarded as a literal or metaphori-\ncal concept (Newell, 1991; Morris et al., 1994; Ostry and Feldman,\n2003; Latash, 2008a; Summers and Anson, 2009 ).\nThe study of motor control thus provides a rather privileged\nmanner for evaluating cognitive and neural bases of tool use.\nThrough the study of motor control, one may effectively see what\nis controlled in terms of mechanical principles (e.g., velocity,\nforce, energy). Further to this, motor control allows the observer\nto see how the action is controlled, most commonly in the form\nof kinematic organization. Looking at a series of tool use actions\nin this manner provides valuable insight into how the nervous\nsystem as a whole prioritizes or controls different aspects of the\naction. This is, in essence, the same logic used by Bernstein in\nsome of the earliest studies of motor control in tool use (reviewed\nby Latash, 2000; Biryukova and Bril, 2002 ). Conducted during\nthe 1920s and at the height of Taylorism, Bernstein’s studies had\nbeen organized under the direction of the Soviet Ministry for\nScientiﬁc Labor Organization. Their purpose had been to facili-\ntate the standardization of labor techniques and thereby increase\nworker efﬁciency. When analyzing the hammering techniques of\nexpert blacksmith’s however, Bernstein made a rather remarkable\nobservation. Although it had been expected that variability in\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 2\nParry et al. Functional dynamics in tool use\njoint contributions would be indicative of poor hammer control,\nthis was not the case. Rather, despite considerable variability of\njoint angle contributions through the striking arm, expert black-\nsmiths exhibited minimal variability of the hammer’s working\npoint trajectory.\nThe results of these experiments highlight in a simple yet ele-\ngant manner some interesting points regarding expert movement\nand neural organization. Evidently, in the case of these expert sub-\njects, the nervous system did not seek to exploit any unique move-\nment pattern, a variety of functionally equivalent movements\nwere used to comparable effect. For Bernstein, it seemed unlikely\nthat the brain would speciﬁcally prescribe different kinematic and\nkinetic proﬁles upon each trial, with individually programmed\njoint trajectory and muscle activation patterns. He concluded that\nduring these expert movements, the ensemble of joints compris-\ning the multi-segmental effector system was compensating for\nvariability arising from each individual articulation.\nToday the terms “synergy” and “coordinative structure” are\ncommonly used to describe this functionally speciﬁc organization\nof neural, muscular, and skeletal elements evoked in Bernstein’s\nobservations ( Latash, 2008b; Kelso, 2009 ). It is maintained that\nthe arrangement of motor apparatus in such a way permits the\nhighly ﬂexible and responsive movement characteristic of dexter-\nous tool use. Assembled across the nervous system as the situation\nor context evolves, the synergy facilitates sensory and mechan-\nical feedback—effectively modulating network activity so that\nthe task speciﬁc objectives may be stabilized. This theory that\nmotor control is organized by these coordinative structures is also\nconsistent with physiological literature. For example, it has been\ndemonstrated that descending tract activity is in fact unable to\ndirectly prescribe muscle activity in terms of torque or trajec-\ntory. The central commands instead appear to regulate postural\nand movement responses by changing threshold values of mus-\ncle length ( Matthews, 1959; Ostry and Feldman, 2003; Houk and\nRymer, 2011 ). It has been argued that the existence of synergies\nis evidenced by the exceptionally rapid adaptation of movement\nin response to perturbation during goal directed activity ( Kelso,\n2009). The Uncontrolled Manifold Hypothesis (UCM; Scholz and\nSchöner, 1999) provides a method of measuring the coordinative\nstructure by separating the movement variability that does not\naffect the performance outcome (compensated variability) from\nthe movement variability that does compromise one’s ability to\nsatisfy the task requirements (non-compensated variability).\nWhilst the blacksmiths of Bernstein’s early work on percus-\nsive tool use indicated that experts tend to exploit the abundant\ndegrees of freedom at their disposal in actual tool use activity, the\nrelationship between functional dynamics and movement vari-\nability is less clear during other phases of motor learning. In a\nrecent theoretical article, Latash (2010) described a novel view\non stages of motor learning using this principle of synergies. It\nwas proposed that initial stages of learning, obliged the actor\nto explore functional dynamics of the task at hand to allow for\nthe discovery of effective movement parameters. With increased\nexperience, task performance would then become stabilized as\nsynergies became more robust—thus allowing greater ﬂexibility\nof movement as the neuromotor system became more adept at\nregulating the mechanical conditions necessary for successful task\nperformance. Finally, once movement synergies reached a stage\nwhere uncompensated variability could not be further reduced,\ntheir composition may be altered in order to optimize other rele-\nvant factors secondary to task performance, favoring for example,\nenergy conservation or the aesthetic features of movement.\nIn this paper we use an experimental protocol to explore\nhow movement synergies develop in tool use. This will be done\nthrough the observation of coordinative structure at different lev-\nels of expertise. We propose here that tool use capacity is ﬁrst and\nforemost a learned ability to manipulate the functional dynamics\nof the task at hand. Given this, our analysis will focus upon subject\nability to satisfy task constraints and its relationship to kinematic\nmovement patterns.\nThe data presented here adds to the existing body of work\nbased around the technique of stone knapping. It is a technique\nthat involves the removal of stone ﬂakes from a ﬂint core and\nwas widely employed by prehistoric man in the production of\nedged cutting tools. Certain knapping techniques continue to be\nused today, in the production of architectural ﬂint and artisanal\ncrafts for example. Given that stone knapping provides the ear-\nliest known evidence of human tool use and tool production, it\nis often considered to reﬂect both cognitive and manual skills\nthat distinguish human tool use abilities from those of other\nspecies. Previous studies have linked stone knapping to the evo-\nlution of anatomical and biomech anical properties of the upper\nlimb ( Marzke and Marzke, 2000; Rolian et al., 2011; Williams\net al., 2012 ); the expansion of cortico-cerebellar circuitry sup-\nporting motor control ( Bril et al., 2012 ) and the acquisition of\nthe cognitive capacities supporting language and communication\n(Toth et al., 1993; Stout et al., 2008; Stout and Chaminade, 2012;\nUomini and Meyer, 2013 ).\nIn certain respects, the removal of a stone ﬂake is similar to\nother percussive tasks such as driving a nail into wood, hitting a\ngolf ball, or breaking the hard shell of a nut. All require the use\nof forceful, striking movements to achieve the goal at hand. What\ndistinguishes one of these tasks from any other though are the\nobjectives of the activity, the materials involved and the functional\ndynamics of each situation. Here we use the framework developed\nby Bril and colleagues ( Bril et al., 2009, 2010, 2012; Nonaka et al.,\n2010; Rein et al., 2013 ) in their previous studies on the mastery\nof percussive techniques as a practical framework for deﬁning the\ncharacteristics of the task and the performance of the actor (see\nFigure 2).\nIn this model, the task constraints are the conditions necessary\nto effectuate the desired goal. To satisfy task constraints, the actor\nmust generate speciﬁc values of functional parameters (kinetic\nenergy, angle of blow, and point of percussion). The actor may do\nt h i sb yu s i n ga n yo n eo fav a r i e t yo fm u t u a l l yd e p e n d e n tc o m b i n a -\ntions of control parameters (hammer mass, velocity at impact). In\nturn, a multitude of potentially valid strategies (potential energy,\ntrajectory, muscular effort) are at the disposal of the actor as he\nattempts to regulate the relationship between these combinations\nof control parameters. Finally, given that the number of degrees\nof freedom deﬁning the task constraints is fewer than the num-\nber found in the multi-segmental effector system, there exist an\ninﬁnite number of combinations of movement parameters (kinet-\nics, kinematics, muscle control) that could serve as valid motor\nwww.frontiersin.org April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 3\nParry et al. Functional dynamics in tool use\nFIGURE 2 | Framework for the study of percussive tool use actions.\nSuccessful task performance is dependent upon satisfying task constraints.\nThe experiment presented here used a series of sensors to record upper limb\nmovement. Reconstruction of this data using a biomechanical modeling\nprocess then enabled the study of how subjects controlled the various\nparameters involved in the percussive task (adapted fromBril et al., 2010, 2012).\nsolutions. This framework facilitates the study of percussive tasks\nby highlighting interplay between the complexity of a percussive\ntask, the strategy chosen by the actor, and the coordination of the\nmovement during the performance of the action.\nAs with other ﬁne grain materials such as glass, cornelian and\nquartz, the intentional shaping, or reduction or a ﬂint core is\nmade possible through conchoidal fracture ( Roux et al., 1995 ).\nSuccessfully removing a stone ﬂake by this action is dependent\nupon relationships between several variables; the external plat-\nform angle, the point of percussion, the angle of the blow and\nthe kinetic energy delivered to the point of impact (see Figure 3).\nThe conchoidal fracture is contrasted with “split breaking,” which\ncan occur independently of these other variables upon the appli-\ncation of a sufﬁciently large force. The removal of ﬂakes by split\nbreaking offers very limited control over the form and number of\nﬂakes produced (see Pelegrin, 2005; Bril et al., 2012 for further\ndiscussion).\nIn practice, producing a stone ﬂake of a pre-determined form\nis by no means a trivial accomplishment; it requires highly\nattuned perceptual-motor capacities. For example, in the research\npresented by Nonaka et al. (2010) , participants of varying levels of\nexperience in Oldowan stone knapping techniques were required\nto trace an outline indicating the dimensions of the ﬂake they\nintended to produce prior to each attempt. Only those subjects\nhaving extensive knapping experience demonstrated the capacity\nto reliably predict and control the ﬂake removal process, effec-\ntively revealing their expert appreciation for the higher order\nrelationships existing between the multiple functional parameters\nat play.\nAs part of the experiments presented by Bril et al. (2010) ,p a r -\nticipants in a series of stone knapping activities were required to\nuse hammerstones with varying mass. Several particularly inter-\nesting observations were made through the course of the analysis.\nFirstly, only expert knappers were able to adapt their movements\nin such a way that left the resulting kinetic energy unaltered\nbetween hammer conditions, proving their remarkable sensitiv-\nity to this key functional parameter. Secondly, whereas novice\nand intermediate subjects tended to compensate for lower ham-\nmer masses by increasing the muscular force they applied, expert\nsubjects maintained resultant kinetic energy by increasing trajec-\ntory length and thereby the potential energy upon initiation of\nthe movement. In other words, when adapting to different con-\ntrol parameters, experts sought motor solutions that harnessed\nexternal forces, namely that of gravity.\nThe movement parameters involved in stone knapping tasks\nhave also drawn the attention of several recent studies. In a\npaper by Williams et al. (2010) , kinematic analysis revealed a\nproportionately high level of movement at the wrist in four\nbeginner/novice stone knappers. Together with a proximal-distal\nsequencing pattern, the high level of wrist activity was judged\nto be advantageous in developing greater accuracy and velocity.\nConversely, in a study with four experts and eight novices, Rein\net al. (2013) observed that the elbow joint provided a greater con-\ntribution to the knapping task than both the shoulder and wrist\njoints. Reﬂecting the ﬁndings of Bril et al. (2010) , expert subjects\nin this experiment were also observed to exhibit smaller hammer\nvelocities than subjects of the novice group.\nAs part of the data analysis process, Rein et al. (2013) also\nattempted to characterize movement variability using the UCM\nand determined that stone knappers coordinate their movement\nto minimize the variability of the hammerstone’s working point\ntrajectory (one should be mindful however, that the UCM anal-\nysis of this study was limited to movement characteristics per-\ntaining to the striking arm and did not test hypotheses regarding\ncontrol as it related to the functional parameters themselves). And\nwhile novice subjects did exhibit greater variability of working\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 4\nParry et al.

Overestimating\nthe importance of velocity at the time of impact will inevitably\nhave negative consequences upon precision ( Fitts, 1954 ;s e ea l s o\nDomkin et al., 2002 , for another example of this effect in a UCM\nanalysis).\nIn addition to studies on Oldowan stone ﬂaking, stone knap-\nping by counterblow, a technique used by artisanal craftsmen in\nIndia, has also been the subject of several studies on complex tool\nuse behavior. In relation to the movement capacities of these arti-\nsans, Biryukova and Bril (2008) found the kinematic patterns of a\ngroup of expert subjects to be strikingly individual. More intrigu-\ning still was the fact that the most expert and versatile subject\namongst the craftsmen demonstrated far greater joint angle con-\ntribution variability than other subjects. They concluded that the\nnumber of joints involved and similarly the potential number of\neffective joint angle contributions available to a subject increased\nas a function of skill.\nIn contrast to the prior studies, the following experiment\nincorporates actors of varying levels of expertise. Included are\nsubjects having no prior experience at all on the set task, nor\nan academic appreciation of stone tool techniques (referred to\nhereon as uninitiated subjects). Other subjects of this study\npresent with a varying range of skill and experience in stone\nknapping. This design hence permits study of the stone ﬂak-\ning action at novice, intermediate, and expert levels. Instead of\nexploring movement performance through tools for measuring\ncentral tendency, this study will place the emphasis on the fea-\ntures of a series of individual movements. In doing so, we intend\nto observe if certain movement patterns or strategies are typical\nat a given stage of expertise in tool use.\nHere, tool use is considered primarily as a goal directed activ-\nity, fundamentally deﬁned by task speciﬁc mechanical principles.\nWe suggest that rather than seeking to learn a speciﬁc move-\nment, the nervous system seeks to learn the action ( Bernstein,\n1996; Reed and Bril, 1996 ) through exploration of the func-\ntional dynamics of the body-tool-environment system. As such,\nwe hypothesized that numerous kinematic patterns would prove\neffective in the stone ﬂaking task. In other words, we anticipated\nthat successful tool use actions would not be characterized by any\nparticular kinematic proﬁle.\nOur second hypothesis was that kinematic movement vari-\nability would ﬂuctuate according to a subject’s sensitivity to\nfunctional dynamics. It was expected that subjects having no\nprior experience on this novel task (the uninitiated group) would\nemploy highly variable movement patterns as they would be\no b l i g e dt oe x p l o r et h ed y n a m i c so ft h i sc o m p l e xt o o lu s ea c t i v i t y .\nHaving discovered a limited set of body-tool-environment conﬁg-\nurations in satisfying task constraints, novice, and intermediate\nsubjects were expected to have more regular kinematic move-\nment proﬁles. Lastly, expert tool use performance was expected\nto demonstrate a high level of sensitivity to the functional param-\neters during the stone ﬂaking task ( Bril et al., 2010; Nonaka et al.,\n2010). We anticipated that these subjects would have more vari-\nable kinematic movement proﬁles as robust synergies ensured the\nstability of functional parameters through the ﬂexible covariation\nof upper limb segments.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 19 human subjects (8 males, 11 females) participated\nin this study. The mean age of the sample was 35.3 years (median\n28 years; standard deviation 14.5 years; range 23–71 years). The\nabsence of pathology impacting upon upper limb function was a\ncondition for participation in this experiment. Only one subject, a\nﬂint worker by profession, was remunerated for his participation.\nAll other subjects were unpaid volunteers. The majority of the\nsubjects having a background understanding of lithic tool pro-\nduction were recruited through academic institutions in the Paris\nregion. The ﬂint-working professional (P18-JL) and one expe-\nrienced hobbyist (P19-BM) were recruited separately through\nexisting professional relationships. Subjects having no knowl-\nedge or experience in stone knapping techniques (the uninitiated\ngroup) were sourced from visitors and staff at the Paris-Descartes\nUniversity campus.\nAPPARATUS\nBasalt hammerstones were used for this experiment. Each was\nspeciﬁcally selected as having the properties required for hard-\nhammer percussion in Oldowan lithic tool production (corre-\nsponding to the lower Paleolithic period between 2.6 Myr to 1.7\nwww.frontiersin.org April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 5\nParry et al. Functional dynamics in tool use\nMyr ago; see Roche, 2005 for further detail). The task analyzed for\nthe purposes of this study involved the use of hammerstones that\nwere roughly ovoid in shape. Flint stone cores served as the raw\nmaterial for stone ﬂake production. Having been acquired from\none unique source, there was limited variability in the quality of\nthe ﬂint itself. All cores had been pre-formed into the shape of\na frustrum (a truncated pyramid) by a commercial ﬂint work-\ning professional prior to the experiment. This measure served to\nfacilitate immediate ﬂake production by all participants whilst\nalso ensuring that all subjects started under relatively similar\nconditions.\nMovement parameters were recorded using a spatial tracking\nsystem (Polhemus Liberty, Polhemus Corporation; Colchester,\nVT—referred to heron as STS), a device which determines posi-\ntion and orientation of its associated sensors relative to a sta-\ntionary system by means of an electromagnetic ﬁeld. This STS\npermits the recording of movements in six degrees of freedom\n(x,y,z and rotation along the axes, x,y,z). All data was sampled at\na frequency of 240 Hz and recorded online using MotionTracker\nv1.43 (BIOMETRICS France; Gometz-le-Châtel, Île de France).\nPROTOCOL\nThe experimental protocol used here respected the ethical guide-\nlines of the American Psychological Association (APA). Following\nthe provision of clear information on the conditions of partic-\nipation, each subject gave their written consent. Prior to com-\nmencing the experimental procedure, personal data (e.g., height,\nweight, age) was collected and anthropometrical features of the\nstriking arm were recorded in order to permit geometric model-\ning of the upper limb at a later stage.\nSTS sensors were applied to the striking arm with adhesive tape\nat the dorsal surface of the hand, the dorsal surface of the lower\narm, the lateral aspect of the upper arm and the dorsal aspect of\nthe coracoid process of the scapula, reﬂecting the protocol used by\nBiryukova and colleagues ( Biryukova et al., 2000; Biryukova and\nBril, 2008)( s e eFigure 5).\nThe ﬁnal stage of preparation involved using the STS stylus\nto record the location of various anatomical landmarks of the\nupper limb and thorax in relation to the STS sensors, follow-\ning the calibrated anatomical system technique (CAST; Cappozzo\net al., 1995 ) and in accordance with the International Society of\nBiomechanics (ISB) recommendations on joint coordinate sys-\ntems ( Wu et al., 2005 ). In addition to the stated anatomical\nlandmarks, working surfaces were also deﬁned. This was done by\nusing the STS stylus to record the striking surface of the frustrum\nin relation to an STS sensor ﬁxed at its base. Similarly, the point\nof impact used on each hammerstone was recorded in relation to\nthe STS sensor ﬁxed to each subject’s striking hand as it was held\nduring the habitual striking grasp.\nAll subjects received the same instructions and model stone\nﬂakes (small and large) were provided to subjects in order to\ndemonstrate the general dimensions of the desired end product.\nNo restriction was placed upon the subjects’ seated posture and\nno time was imposed for completion of the task, allowing sub-\njects to freely explore the materials at hand. Each subject was then\nrequired to carry out a series of ﬂaking tasks in a total of six con-\nditions (small and large ﬂake production with hammers of three\nvarious masses) in order to determine level of expertise ( Bril et al.,\n2010). Three strikes only were permitted in an attempt to pro-\nduce one stone ﬂake and subjects were requested to produce three\nﬂakes in each condition. All stone ﬂakes removed during this pro-\ncess were collected, weighed and labeled. The image of an expert\nsubject carry out a stone ﬂaking task is provided in Figure 3C.\nALLOCATION OF SKILL LEVEL\nEach individual’s level of expertise was next attributed based upon\ntheir ability to produce small and large ﬂakes with a series of dif-\nferent tools (per Protocol). No qualitative distinction was made\nto classify the form of a ﬂake as being characteristic of con-\nchoidal fracture or split breaking. Measures of mean ﬂake mass\nand standard deviation (SD) were used as the basis to determine\none’s ability to intentionally and consistently control stone ﬂake\ndimensions, as per Figure 4.\nAllocation to both intermediate and expert groups was depen-\ndent upon the ability to consistently produce both small and\nlarge ﬂakes upon command. Expert status was then attributed\nto those individuals who produced ﬂakes with a high level of\nregularity—as indicated by mean ﬂake masses relative to SD.\nNovices were deﬁned as subjects with irregular stone ﬂake pro-\nduction. This included ﬁrstly those subjects who produced small\nand large ﬂakes on an inconsistent basis and; secondly, subjects\nwho removed ﬂakes of regular mass and dimension, incapable of\nproducing ﬂakes of varying size during the experiment. Subjects\nof the uninitiated group were unable to produce ﬂakes of the pre-\nscribed size, having highly variable ﬂake masses over the different\nconditions. The ﬁnal composition of each group is presented in\nTa b l e 1.\nBIOMECHANICAL MODELING\nThe ﬁrst stages of biomechanical modeling involved the creation\nof the anatomical frame of reference by calculating the offsets of\nthe anatomical landmarks (recorded with the STS stylus) from\nthe adjacent sensors (refer to Figure 5). The geometric model\nof the arm, drawn from the manually measured anthropomet-\nrical features, was then integrated using the method described\nby Hanavan (1964) . With upper limb and thorax positions in\nplace, the offset of the shoulder joint center from the acromion\nprocess was calculated using the sphere ﬁtting process ( Leardini\net al., 1999; Stokdijk et al., 2000 ). Following this, elbow and wrist\njoint centers were calculated based upon the assumption that all\njoint centers could be found at the center of the axes constructed,\nrespectively, by the two epicondyles at the elbow and the two\nstyloid processes at the wrist (see Figure 5). This method pro-\nvided one unique joint center at each articulation around which\njoint axes could then be calculated ( Grood and Suntay, 1983;\nZatsiorsky, 1998).\nAn optimization process was then used to eliminate artifacts\nin the movement data, evident in the form of temporal variations\nin the distance between adjacent joint centers—a consequence\nof STS sensor displacement relative to the underlying anatom-\nical landmark and usually the consequence of the deformation\nof skin and underlying muscular and adipose tissues during the\nrapid, forceful movement characteristic of percussive tasks. This\nprocess involved the recalculation of segment lengths for each\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 6\nParry et al.

These recalculated segment lengths were then imposed\nupon the axes already in place. The ﬁnal model presented here\npresents movement relative to three degrees of freedom at each\njoint for a total of nine degrees of freedom. All movement anal-\nysis was performed using customized scripts which were coded\nusing MotionInspector v1.43 (BIOMETRICS France; Gometz-le-\nChâtel, Île de France).\nANALYSIS OF TASK PERFORMANCE\nOnly one speciﬁc ﬂaking task was analyzed for the purposes of the\npresent study, that of small ﬂake production with a 600 g ham-\nmerstone. This measure ensured that the striking action analyzed\ncorresponded to reasonably equivalent task constraints. This\nparticular task was chosen ﬁrstly because most knappers typically\nprefer hammerstones of this approximate weight and secondly\nbecause small ﬂakes tend to be easier to produce than larger ﬂakes\n(Bril et al., 2010 ). Measures of ﬂake mass variability were used to\ndetermine each subject’s ability to intentionally and consistently\ncontrol stone ﬂake production. These measures included range,\nSD, and coefﬁcient of variation (CV = SD/mass × 100). The\nstatistical signiﬁcance of CV between each group was calculated\nusing one way t-tests with a Bonferroni correction ( p = 0.05/6)\nto determine if CV reduced as a function of expertise.\nREGULATION OF FUNCTIONAL PARAMETERS\nRelationships between key functional parameters were calculated\nusing data extracted from the biomechanical model. Maximal\nkinetic energy was determined with reference to the working\npoint of the hammer according to the formula E\nk = 1/2 mv2.\nPotential energy was calculated with respect to vertical distances\nbetween the frustrum and the working point of the tool accord-\ning to the formula E\np = mgh (g = 9.81 ms−2). Ratios of kinetic\nenergy to potential energy ( Ek/Ep) were also calculated in order to\nhighlight movement strategies in terms of muscular effort (refer\nto Figure 2).\nTwo way t-tests were used to determine if statistically signif-\nicant differences existed between the four groups in terms of\nmaximal kinetic energy, potential energy, and the ratio of kinetic\nenergy to potential energy. The Bonferroni correction described\nabove was used in all cases. Whilst data relating to the angle of\nblow and point of percussion may be extracted from the task spe-\nciﬁc biomechanical model presented here, this is unfortunately\noutside the scope of the present paper.\nwww.frontiersin.org April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 7\nParry et al. Functional dynamics in tool use\nFIGURE 5 | Location of upper limb movement sensors and calculation\nof joints using the CAST method (calibrated anatomical system\ntechnique). Rectangular blue markers correspond to the approximate\nplacement of movement sensors whilst circles indicate anatomical\nlandmarks recorded using the stylus of the spatial tracking system.\nPOSTURAL ORGANIZATION AND MOVEMENT ANALYSIS\nVideo recordings of ﬂaking tasks were synchronized with their\ncorresponding biomechanical reconstruction and permitted an\ninitial qualitative evaluation of joint coordination proﬁles. The\nstriking movement itself was determined according the displace-\nment of the STS sensor ﬁxed to the striking hand. The beginning\nof the movement was deﬁned as the moment where the sen-\nsor reached its highest point on the vertical axis prior to the\nstrike. The movement was deemed to have ended when the STS\nsensor reached either its lowest point or when it slowed to a\nspeed inferior to 4 .17 × 10\n−3 m/s (the time between two frames\nat 240 Hz).\nANALYSIS OF COORDINATION BY SEGMENTAL CONTRIBUTION\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA), one of the more classic sta-\ntistically driven techniques for recognizing patterns in movement\ndata was applied to kinematic data of striking movements. This\nmethod was chosen for two reasons. Firstly the PCA facilitated\nthe comparison of movements through compression of the mul-\ntidimensional datasets. Secondly, use of the covariation matrix\nserved to represent the data in a way that reﬂects the under-\nlying movement synergies ( Ting and Chvatal, 2011 ). The PCA\nwas applied to each striking movement, following the equation\nϕ\ni (t) − ϕMi (t) = ∑\nk wkiξk (t),w h e r et h ev e c t o ro ft e m p o r a l\nvariation of joint angles around their mean values is deﬁned as\nbeing equal to the sum of the principal components. Using this\nmathematical technique, each principal component is presented\naccording to its magnitude so that the ﬁrst principal compo-\nnent (PC1) corresponds with the axis along which the dataset is\nmost spread; the second principal component (PC2) describes an\northogonal axis which describes the next most important data\nvariance and so on. Use of this method generally permits the\ndescription and analysis of a signiﬁcant percentage of movement\ndata through one or two matrices ( Rein, 2012).\nFinally, the regularity of joint angle contributions to PC1 was\nthen calculated for each subject’s three successful attempts. This\nwas done using by comparing absolute values of Pearson’s cor-\nrelation coefﬁcient from the PC1 loadings across each of the\nnine degrees of freedom represented in the biomechanical model\nstrikes (successful strike 1 vs. successful strike 2; successful strike\n1 vs. successful strike 3; successful strike 2 vs. successful strike 3).\nThe correlation coefﬁcient was considered to be signiﬁcant at a\nvalue greater than 0.7.\nRESULTS\nTASK PERFORMANCE\nThe data pertaining to the speciﬁc task of small ﬂake produc-\ntion with the 600 g hammerstone yielded a total of 89 strikes, of\nwhich 53 produced a ﬂake. From the three attempts granted to\neach subject per trial, uninitiated subjects employed an average of\n2.2 strikes in order to remove a ﬂake while novices used an aver-\nage of 1.6 strikes. Intermediate and expert group subjects used an\naverage 1.3 and 1.4 strikes per trial respectively in removal of the\nstone ﬂakes.\nGiven that successfully controlling the size of stone ﬂake\nproduction was the goal of the set task, ﬂake mass variabil-\nity was used as the primary indicator of task performance.\nSummary statistics of ﬂake mass production by group are pro-\nvided in Ta b l e 2. Overall, uninitiated subjects produced ﬂakes\nwith highly variable results ( SD = 65.1g ; r a n g e = 1–232 g),\nas did members of the novice group ( SD = 30.5g ; r a n g e =\n2–94 g). The intermediate ( SD = 23.7g ; r a n g e = 1–75 g) and\nexpert groups ( SD = 19.7g ; r a n g e = 2–56 g) were more con-\nsistent in their stone ﬂake production. Importantly, SD and\nrange of the mass of ﬂakes produced by each group can be\nseen to decrease according to the level of expertise (as can be\nseen in Ta b l e 2). It is also interesting to note that the median\nﬂake mass of the expert group is the same as the model ﬂake\nprovided (12 g).\nNo statistically signiﬁcant difference of CVs between the\nrespective groups was found following t-tests. It should be rec-\nognized however that the power of any statistical test would be\nlimited given the small sample sizes.\nREGULATION OF FUNCTIONAL PARAMETERS\nNovice, intermediate and expert subjects all produced rela-\ntively similar levels of kinetic energy across the task in question\n(mean E\nk = 4.20 J, SD = 1.27 J; mean Ek = 5.21 J, SD = 2.36 J;\nmean Ek = 4.44 J, SD = 2.56 J, respectively). Uninitiated subjects\ndemonstrated exceptionally high levels of kinetic energy, at an\naverage of 12.30 J ( SD = 4.88 J), a factor which proved to be\nstatistically signiﬁcant to all other groups.\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 8\nParry et al.

Mean values for\npotential energy did however show a tendency to decrease as a\nfunction of expertise with mean values of 2.24 J ( SD = 0.47 J)\nfor the novice group, 2.13 J ( SD = 1.34 J) for the intermediate\ngroup and 1.37 J ( SD = 0.45 J) for the expert group. This differ-\nence proved to be statistically signiﬁcant between the novice and\nexpert groups.\nThe average ratio of kinetic energy to potential energy was\nalso very high amongst uninitiated subjects (mean E\nk/Ep =\n3.64, SD = 0.82). Conversely, novice subjects demonstrated\nparticularly low average ratios of kinetic energy to poten-\ntial energy ( E\nk/Ep = 1.90, SD = 0.50), with intermediate and\nexpert subjects demonstrating respectively higher ratios of mean\nkinetic energy to potential energy ( E\nk/Ep = 2.82, SD = 0.94\nand Ek/Ep = 3.04, SD = 1.39, respectively). Multiple t-tests with\nBonferroni corrections proved all groups to be signiﬁcantly differ-\nent to each other. Data on the regulation of functional parameters\nis presented in both Ta b l e 2and Figure 6.\nPOSTURAL ORGANIZATION AND MOVEMENT ANALYSIS\nIndividual differences in terms of postural preference and move-\nment proﬁles were evident upon analysis of video data synchro-\nnized with the reconstructed kinematic model. Some subjects\npositioned the core upon or against their leg whilst other sub-\njects held the core in front of their body (see also Bril et al., 2010 ).\nWhilst the majority of subjects carried out the task whilst seated\non a stool, certain subjects chose to be seated on the ground for\nthe duration of the ﬂaking tasks.\nSpatiotemporal aspects of striking movements were also seen\nto be vary both on intraindividual and interindividual bases.\nSome subjects demonstrated striking movements characterized\nby high levels of wrist contribution, other subjects demonstrated\nmovements characterized by high levels of elbow contribution.\nNo apparent relationship between kinematic movement organi-\nzation and expertise was evident. An example of two expert strikes\n(P18-JL strike 2 and P19-BM strike 2) is provided in Figure 7.I ti s\ninteresting to note that while angular variations and the duration\nof the striking movements are quite different in these two strikes,\nthe working point trajectories appear remarkably similar.\nJOINT ANGLE CONTRIBUTION\nOverall, PC1 accounted for 71% of joint angle variation\n(median = 72%; SD = 8%; range 55–81%), while PC2 accounted\nfor 17% (median = 18%; SD = 5%; range = 11–25%) of joint\nvariation in the ﬂaking task. The percentage of joint angle varia-\ntion accounted for by PC1 in the uninitiated group members was\nobserved to be considerably lower than that of other groups at\n64%. Limited differences were evident in the percentages of joint\na n g l ev a r i a t i o na c c o u n t e df o rb yP C 1i nt h eo t h e rt h r e eg r o u p s ,\nwith PC1 accounting for 74, 75, and 76%, respectively, for the\nnovice, intermediate and expert groups. PC1 and PC2 combined\naccounted for greater than 90% of joint angle variation in all\ngroups except for the uninitiated group for whom the sum of\nPC1 and PC2 accounted for 84%. Having this amount of vari-\nance expressed by the ﬁrst two principal components is indicative\nof a level of compression sufﬁcient for valid data analysis ( Rein,\n2012).\nThe loading factors of PC1 and PC2 were used to analyze rel-\native joint contributions to each movement and the regularity\nof coordinative structure in each subject’s attempts at the task\nin question. Figure 8 provides joint angle loadings on PC1 for\nthree subjects representative of each group. This Figure highlights\nthe exceptional variability of movement strategies employed by\nthe subjects of this experiment, on both interindividual and\nintraindividual bases.\nThe variability of coordinative structure in strikes that success-\nfully removed a ﬂake was also examined on an individual basis\nusing Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients (these strikes are indi-\ncated by an “F” in Figure 8). No subject had joint angle loadings\nwith signiﬁcant correlation coefﬁcients in all three comparisons.\nThese results indicate that successful ﬂake production was not\ndependent upon consistent patterns of joint angle coordination.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study examined tool use actions in a healthy adult popula-\ntion by means of kinematic movement analysis. From the outset,\nit was proposed that tool use capacity was based upon a learned\nability to manipulate the functional dynamics of a given situation,\nas opposed to being a skill determined by movement character-\nistics per se . As such, we expected individuals to demonstrate a\nvariety of motor patterns during a functionally equivalent (having\nthe same task constraints) tool use activity. Using stone ﬂake pro-\nduction by hardhammer percussion (based upon the Oldowan\ntradition) as the tool use activity in the experimental procedure,\nthis study included participants of varying levels of experience\nat the task; from those with no prior exposure to the activity,\nthrough to individuals with many years of regular practice.\nRelationships between the regulation of functional param-\neters and movement parameters (see Figure 2) were observed\nwww.frontiersin.org April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 9\nParry et al.

In addition to this, it was\nhypothesized that the variability of a subject’s joint angle con-\ntributions in the striking action would vary as a function of\nexpertise. Speciﬁcally, we expected that uninitiated group sub-\njects would use varied combinations of movements as they\nexplored functional dynamics while novice and intermediate sub-\njects would have comparably less movement variability, indica-\ntive of the limited number of task-speciﬁc movement patterns\nin their motor repertoire. Finally, movement variability was\nexpected to be relatively high in experts, as robust synergies\nwould exploit the multiple degrees of freedom at play in the\nbody-tool-environment system in order to stabilize the functional\nparameters of the task.\nT h er e s u l t so ft h i se x p e r i m e n tp r o v e dt h eﬁ r s to ft h e s e\nhypotheses to be correct; successful task performance was not cor-\nrelated with any speciﬁc movement pattern. The second of these\nhypotheses proved incorrect. Indeed, both subjects with highly\nvariable joint contribution proﬁles and subjects with compara-\nbly less variable joint contribution proﬁles were present in each\nskill level group (see Figures 8, 9). These particular results hold\ninterest ﬁrstly in the context of the existing body of work on stone\nknapping and skill acquisition in early man; and secondly, in the\nbroader context of understanding the cognitive and neurological\nbases of human tool use.\nThe analysis of the kinematic movement data presented here\nrevealed that successfully removing stone ﬂakes from a ﬂint\ncore by the Oldowan method was not contingent upon speciﬁc\nwww.frontiersin.org April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 11\nParry et al.

Effective stone\nﬂaking actions characterized by relatively high contributions of\neach joint were observed through the course of the experiment\n(see Figure 8, P7-AG; P4-CKB; and P18-JL for respective exam-\nples). This result may be seen to validate previously contrasting\nﬁndings of experiments that found stone ﬂaking actions to be\ncharacterized by high levels of wrist contribution ( Williams et al.,\n2010) and others ﬁnding the elbow to have the most important\ncontribution to the action ( Rein et al., 2013 ).\nAlthough based upon a different technique, the highly indi-\nvidual nature of upper limb kinematics demonstrated by the\nsubjects in this study reﬂects the ﬁndings of Biryukova and col-\nleagues ( Biryukova and Bril, 2008; Biryukova et al., in press ).\nFurther to this, the results of the present study also indicate that\npatterns of kinematic movement variability are not a reliable\nmeasure of skill (cf. B i r y u k o v ae ta l . ,i np r e s s). Rather, relative\ntool use ability—expertise as it were, was manifested princi-\npally by the stability and intentional control of task performance.\nFurther differences between those with no task speciﬁc experi-\nence (uninitiated) through to expert practitioners of the stone\nknapping technique were also apparent through the regulation\nof and sensitivity to key functional parameters ( Bril et al., 2010 ).\nRelationships between these different parameters is highlighted\nhere in Figure 2 and facilitates the analysis of tool use ability in\nterms of action.\nWith respect to actual stone ﬂake production, members of the\nuninitiated group demonstrated particularly erratic performance\nas evidenced by high measures of statistical dispersion. This vari-\nability of stone ﬂake production (indicated by ﬂake mass) was\ng e n e r a l l yo b s e r v e dt or e d u c ew i t he a c hr e s p e c t i v el e v e lo fe x p e r -\ntise, as shown by the corresponding reduction in range and SD of\nﬂake mass. Expecting identical ﬂake dimensions upon successive\nstrikes is of course unrealistic as even despite pre-shaping, each\ncore varied slightly in terms of form, reﬂective of a real life\nsituation.\nThe values of kinetic energy produced by members of the\nrespective groups was coherent with the characteristics of the\nﬂakes produced. Subjects of the uninitiated group exhibited\nexceptionally high levels of kinetic energy, signifying their lack of\nunderstanding in fracture mechanics. Whilst no qualitative clas-\nsiﬁcation of stone ﬂakes was conducted to discern between split\nbreaking and conchoidal fracture in this experiment, it may safely\nbe assumed that such amounts of kinetic energy would typically\nhave been in excess of the threshold at which split breaking occurs,\nthereby producing ﬂakes of highly variable dimensions. In con-\ntrast, the values of kinetic energy produced by novice group\nmembers is approximately half that of the uninitiated group. One\nmay infer that these subjects, having already been inducted into\nbasic stone knapping techniques, possessed a sound awareness of\nmanaging this key functional parameter when attempting to con-\ntrol stone ﬂake dimensions. Although having somewhat greater\nranges, the intermediate and expert groups produced mean values\nof kinetic energy similar to that of the novice group. It is inter-\nesting to note however, that expert subjects tended to produce\nlarger ﬂakes on average than their intermediate counterparts (as\nindicated by mean and median ﬂake mass, see Ta b l e 2). The uti-\nlization of more energy efﬁcient motor solutions exhibited by\nexpert subjects here reﬂects those ﬁndings of Nonaka et al. (2010) .\nIt suggests that beyond an appreciation of kinetic energy, higher-\nlevel stone knappers have a greater appreciation of the nested\nrelationships between existing between the angle of blow, point\nof percussion, and external angle (see Figures 2, 3).\nA general trend in the use of potential energy is also evi-\ndent between the four skill level groups. As can be observed in\nFigure 6B, subjects tend to reduce the amplitude of their move-\nments (and in such a way the amount to which they harness\ngravity in generating the necessary energy for stone ﬂake removal)\na se x p e r t i s ei n c r e a s e s .I nt h ec a s eo ft h eu n i n i t i a t e dg r o u p ,g e n e r -\nating large amounts of potential energy is clearly representative of\ntheir limited understanding of task constraints (per above). The\nratios of kinetic energy to potential energy shown in Figure 6C\ngive further insights into these movement strategies and indicate\nan increase in the use of muscular energy from novices to experts.\nThe reason for this trend however, is not clearly evident. It may\nbe position that this effect is simply a reﬂection of conﬁdence,\nwhereby subjects who are sure of their actions employ less ample\nmovement but with notably greater velocity. Or it could be that\nthis strategy is of functional importance, and that the greater lev-\nels of acceleration (deduced here from the relationship between\nresultant velocity and length of hammer trajectory) may improve\npropagation of the shock involved in conchoidal fracture, reduc-\ning the likelihood of step fractures or the production of other\nundesirable features upon the core.\nAs opposed to task performance and the regulation of func-\ntional parameters, kinematic aspects of upper limb movement in\nterms of joint angle contribution were not capable of distinguish-\ning subjects of different levels of tool use ability. Subjects with\nhighly variable movement patterns and subjects with comparably\nregular movement patterns were present in each of the four skill\nlevel groups. Furthermore, it is also interesting to note that on\nseveral occasions, two movements with quite similar PC1 load-\nings produced different results. For example, P18-JL is shown to\nemploy movements with almost identical PC1 loadings on both\nhis ﬁrst and second strikes (see Figure 8), but whilst the ﬁrst is\nunsuccessful, the second strike successfully produces a ﬂake. Of\ncourse, what cannot be discerned from the present analysis, is if\nand how this subject may have adjusted other factors, such as the\norientation of the core at the time of the strike. Again, one cannot\ntruly determine the efﬁcacy of the movement independently of\nthe tool-environment system with which it must be synchronized.\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 306| 12\nParry et al. Functional dynamics in tool use\nThis ﬁnding that the regularity of kinematic movement pat-\nterns does not correspond with levels of expertise in this per-\ncussive tool use activity may initially appear to be contrary to\nintuition. Indeed, movement variability is often (incorrectly)\nperceived as being related to error, and is typically thought to\ndecrease with improved task performance ( Stergiou and Decker,\n2011). From a strictly mechanical perspective however, countless\ncombinations of joint angle contributions may produce viable\nmotor solutions to a given problem. The considerable variabil-\nity of movement patterns demonstrated in and across each skill\nlevel group in this experiment support our assertion that during\ntool use, the nervous system learns to manage the action rather\nthan the movement. In any case, perfect reproduction of a certain\nmovement in no way affords the possibility of adaptable behav-\nior. Instead, it seems apparent that humans learn to improve the\neffects of their actions by increasing their understanding of func-\ntional dynamics. And rather than a hindrance, this variability\nwitnessed in patterns of joint angle coordination could be seen\nto enhance this process of motor learning ( Wu et al., 2014 ).\nAt the outset of this experiment, the hypothesis regarding the\nevolution of movement variability and expertise was founded\nupon this idea of exploring, then exploiting the mechanical prop-\nerties comprising the body-tool-environment system. In addition,\nwe contended that synergies provided a viable means for the\nneural control of functional dynamics during dexterous tool\nuse activities. The experimental results presented here did not\nhowever, reﬂect a varying composition of coordinative struc-\ntures across the skill level continuum (see Figures 8, 9). Despite\nthis outcome, we do not interpret this result as meaning that\nindividuals of all skill levels possess equally ﬂexible families of\ntask speciﬁc motor solutions. The simple fact is that predicting\nwhether movement variability is a good or a bad thing is not\na straightforward matter. In the study of Rein et al. (2013) for\nexample, novice subjects actually exhibited greater magnitudes\nof compensated variability of working point position than their\nexpert counterparts—the effect of this was just negated by a level\nof uncompensated variability that was also higher than that of the\nexperts.\nIn the present study, certain differences in joint contribution\nproﬁles appear simply to reﬂect changes in the positioning of the\ncore, adjustments of tool grip or other such postural preference.\nThe causes of these postural variations may in effect have limited\nrelation to an individual’s level of expertise; to maintain exactly\nthe same posture over any duration of time is, under normal cir-\ncumstances, not only uncommon but rather challenging in itself.\nIn order to observe the highly adaptable movement synergies that\nwould distinguish novice subjects from expert subjects, it is likely\nthat more challenging conditions would need to be introduced to\nthe experimental protocol (e.g., using a different tool, performing\nunder stress/fatigue, responding to external perturbations).\nIn conclusion, this study has found that tool use ability\ndepends primarily upon an understanding of the functional\ndynamics that exist across the body-tool-environment system,\nand that kinematic movement proﬁles alone are not sufﬁcient\nto indicate relative skill levels. In other words, when learning\na tool use activity, what the individual learns is the functional\ndynamics of the task rather than any particular movement per se .\nWe argue that functional approaches such as the one employed\nhere are imperative to the understanding of goal directed activity\nin cognitive neuroscience. Logically, it must ﬁrst be understood\nwhat a person is controlling in terms of task relevant parame-\nters in order to understand that which is being represented by\nthe brain.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work presented here uses experimental data collected as part\nof the Masters thesis of Mr. Ross Parry (Master RIM, UPMC,\nParis), under the direction of Blandine Bril and Gilles Dietrich.\nThis project was supported by the EHESS and funded in part by\nthe PHC Programme Sakura, 2013–2014 Bilateral Joint Research\nProjects between the French Ministères des Affaires Étrangères et\nEuropéennes (MAEE) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of\nScience (JSPS).
