    "abstract": "In this paper, a cell balancing topology for a series-connected Lithium-Ion battery string (SCBS) in electric vehicles is proposed and experimentally verified. In particular, this balancing topology based on the modular balancer consists of an intra-module balancer based on a multi-winding transformer circuit and an outer-module balancer based on a switched capacitor converter, both offering the potential advantages and over conventional balancing methods, including short equalization time, simple control scheme, elimination of voltage sensors. In addition, a number of cells in the SCBS can be easily extended in this circuit. Furthermore, a system structure and an operating principle of the proposed topology are analyzed and experimentally verified for three different cases. The voltages of all cells in the SCBS reached the balanced state regardless of the various arrangement of the initial voltage, where the energy efficiency of the circuit reached 83.31%. Our experimental realization of the proposed balancing topology shows that such a technique could be employed in electric vehicles.",
