PCB (CAS number 1336-36-3), C12H10-\nnCln, are manmade organic aromatic hydrocarbons that have 1 to 10 \nchlorine atoms attached to biphenyl, which is a molecule composed \nof two benzene rings each containing six carbon atoms [2]. The \nvariable molecular composition of PCB allows different structural \nconfigurations due to possibility of different arrangements of chlorine \natoms on the benzene rings of the PCB molecule. Theoretically, 209 \ndifferent congeners (isomers), depending upon the number and \npositions of the chlorine atoms, are possible comprising the entire \nset of homologues and isomers, but only about 130 of these are likely \nto occur in commercial products [3]. All congeners of PCBs are \nlipophilic but different congeners sometimes act differently from one \nanother and water solubility decreases as the degree of chlorination \nincreases [4]. \nPrevious studies revealed that the Al alloys in T4 temper leads \nto strengthening by a combination of the G.P zone and δ'(Al\n3Li) \nprecipitates [7]. The alloy in this temper displays a rapid and strong \nnaturally aging response, even without prior cold working. For \nexample, the tensile strength of Weldalite grade alloy in the T4 temper \nis 20% greater than that of the leading, weldable alloy AA2219 in the \nT87 temper [8]. Other noteworthy characteristics of these substances \ninclude low electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity and \nhigh resistance to thermal degradation. Unlike other chemicals, all \nvarieties are chemically very stable (inactive) and don't change their \nchemical status over long time and distance without resting. PCBs \nare non-polar and are thus soluble in non-polar environments like \nin diethyl ether, dichloromethane, chloroform, petroleum ether and \nhexanes, but not soluble in polar environments like water. Moreover, \ndue to the whole set of properties, these molecules have low flash \npoint and no fire point. Although there are no known natural sources \nof PCBs in the nature, the widespread prevalence are related to \ncommercial manufacture, industrial use, storage and disposal.

PCBs were sold under a variety of trade \nnames, the most commons were Aroclor, Apirolio, Phenoclor, \nPyroclor, Inerteen, Colphe and Kanaclor and the total amount \nproduced world-wide is estimated at 1.5 million tons [6]. PCBs were \nmainly used as coolants and insulating fluids in electrical equipment \nlike transformers and capacitors, the so-called closed systems. The \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer and the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) has classified PCBs as a Group B2, probable \nhuman carcinogen [7]. And because of their classification as a human \ncarcinogen, the further manufacture of PCBs was banned by the \nFigure 1: Structure and numbering for PCBs [5].\nInt J Metall Mater Eng                                                                                                                                                                                          IJMME, an open access journal                                                                                                                                          \nISSN: 2455-2372                                                                                                                                                                                                    Volume 1. 2015. 114\nUnited States Congress and by the Stockholm Convention on \nPersistent Organic Pollutants. In Europe, the use of PCBs as a raw \nmaterial or chemical intermediate has been banned since 1985 \n(85/467/EEC, 6th amendment to Directive 76/769/EEC) [8].\nCurrently the production of PCBs is prohibited today, those \nproducts manufactured before the prohibition are still used and \ncontamination still continues.  Transformers and capacitors, which \nwere manufactured prior to 1970s, may contain certain levels \n(ppm) of PCBs in insulating oils. Therefore, all holders of electrical \nequipment should determine whether their equipment contains PCBs \nor verify the absence of PCBs. Although the quantification of PCBs in \nelectrical transformers may seem simple, the diversity of congeners, \nas well as their similar physical and chemical properties makes PCBs \ndifficult compounds to analyses based on the limited information \npresently gathered and published in the scientific literature [9]. \nIn order to determine potential threats, identify the probability of \noccurrence and the potential impact to public and environmental \nhealth, transformers that come out of service must sampled and \nanalyzed. In this study the investigation was carried out on twenty \ntransformers. These transformers operate for long years, different \nloads and operation condition in Turkey. The levels of PCBs expressed \nas sum of the concentrations of six indicators (28, 52, 101, 138, 153 \nand 180) which were suggested by Commitment Bureau of Reference \n(BCR) [10]. And the samples were also tested for the presence of the \nchlorine and total halogens and comparedwith Category I Waste Oil \nin the Regulation on Control of WasteOils [11].\nExperimental\nSample collection\nTwenty samples of transformer oils from various regions of Power \nStation were collected in Turkey. Sampling activities were conducted in \naccordancewith applicable European Union: Council Directive 96/59/\nEC sampling requirements [12]. Before sampling the transformer oil, \nthe working zone was typically marked by signs and disconnecting \npower by electrician. And, prior to sampling, transformers were \ninventoried of which were suspected to be contaminated with PCBs.\nSample preservation and storage\nAll samples were stored in the dark at 4oC until they were processed \nin the laboratory. No other preservatives were added to the samples \nand analyses were completed in 2 days after sample preparation.\nGlassware\nAll the glassware was washed with acetone and n-Hexane, oven-\ndried for at least 8 hr at 100°C and allowed to cool under nitrogen \natmosphere before use. After cooling, the glassware was sealed with \nplugs and/or Teflon® tape to prevent the accumulation of dust or other \ncontaminants.\nPCBs\nInstrumentation\nAn Agilent 6890 Series GC (USA) equipped with a liquid \nautosampler, split/splitless inlet and with Electron capture detector \nwas used in the experiment. Data was acquired and processed by \nAgilent ChemStation. The ChemStation was operated at a data \nacquisition rate of 10 Hz. The detector acquisition rate is fast enough \nto record peak changes in the detector. The software performs system \ncontrol, database management, data handling and output.\nChemicals\nAll chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further \npurification. PCB congeners (28, 52, 101, 118, 153 and 180) standards \nwere obtained as individual stocks from Supelco, Accustandard and \nUltra Scientific. All stock solutions were stored in the dark in a freezer. \nSupelco SCX SPE cartridges were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and \nsilica gel was also from Merck Co. Analytical grade hexane (% 99) was \npurchased from Merck.\nExtraction procedure\nSolid phase extraction procedure was applied to remove the \ninterfering components of the complex matrices in order to obtain \na cleaner extract containing the analytes of interest. According to \nEN 12766, acidified silica and silica adsorbent is used. The SPE \ncartridges were activated by Hexane. Then transformer oil samples \nwere passed through cartridge using Supelco vacuum manifold \nsystem. The extracts were concentrated for about 5 minutes under \nnitrogen gas to remove excess solvent and before GC-ECD analysis \nextracts transferred to an auto sampler vials containing 100 µL insert. \nConcentrated extracts included PCB 30 and 209 internal standards \nprior to extraction. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were done \nby comparison with internal standards. This method has shown a very \ngood recovery (80 – 110%) and accuracy for investigated samples.\nAnalysis\nA gas chromatograph wasequipped with a HT-8 (25 m, 0.22 mm, \n0.25 ID) capillary column and ECD was connected to Agilent 6890 \nintegrator. The analysis was carried out using mass range from 50 to \n500 amu and in Scan mode (EI) [13]. Samples of 1 µl were injected \nin split mode with a split ratio 1:10. The column was temperature \nprogrammed at 75-300°C with a 10oC/min rise. The detector \ntemperature was set at 350°C and the injector temperature at 300°C. \nHelium was used as carrier gas at 1.0 mL/min flow.The limit of \ndetection of the method was below 0.01 ppm.\nQuantitation\nA calibration curve obtained from standards was used for the \nquantification of individual PCBs isomers. Before each run GC-ECD \nsystem performance and calibration are verified for all analytes. \nTotal halogens and chlorine\nFor chlorine and total halogensanalysis, the transformer oils were \ntreated according to EPA Method5050 (bomb preparation) and \nanalyzed according to EPA Method9056A (ion chromatography).A \nDionex ICS 1000 ion chromatography with Dionex DS6 conductivity \ndetector, Dionex isocratic pump and Dionex AS9-HC 4 mm \ncolumnwas used for the analysis.Total Halogen Content in oils was \nexpressed as sum of chlorine (Cl-), fluorine (F-) and bromine (Br-) in \nppm.The limits of quantitation for Cl-, F- and Br- were 0.2, 0.02 and \n0.1 ppm, respectively.\nResults\nThe regulatory guidelines classify materials with levels equal to \nor greater than 50 parts per million (mg/kg) of PCB content to be a \ncontrolled hazardous waste material and require special handling and \ndisposal by law. Generally, transformer oil is a mixture of aliphatic, \nalicyclic, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons but in some cases \nmay contain only PCB mixtures. Because of their highly regulated \nuse and disposal, all oils from transformers need to be sampled\nCitation: Pelitli V , Doğan O, Köroğlu HJ (2015) Transformer Oils Potential for PCBs Contamination. Int J Metall Mater Eng 1: 114. doi: http://dx.doi.\norg/10.15344/2455-2372/2015/114\n       Page 2 of 8\nprior to disposal of the oil and analyzed to determine PCBs content. \nBecause of the obligation, different fundamental machines were used \nto investigation of PCBs in transformer oils. The transformer oil \nsurvey results showed that for the most of the samples, no detectable \nPCBs were observed. The results of peak pattern analysis have \nexplained that except sample 1-3, 4 from 20 transformer oils were not \ncontaminated with PCBs. But sample 1 was exceed the legal limit of \n50 ppm. The sample 1 showed an average PCBs content of 150 ppm \nand was considered a hazardouswaste and must treated accordingly. \nThe results are shown in Table 1. The reported levels raise concern and \ntake appropriate measures to prevent their environmental dispersion \nin global environment.\nThe total halogens and chlorine results of twenty oil samples are \nshown in Table 2. The total halogens and chlorine values range is \nfrom 10 to 337.7 and 10 to 321.8, respectively. There was a significant \nrelationship PCBs and total halogens and chlorine.\nThe significant relationship between PCBs and total halogens \nand chlorine suggests that these ions have significant effect on the \npersistence and concentration of PCBs.\nFurthermore, the characteristics of contaminated transformer \noils were comparedwith Waste Oil Categories in the Regulation on \nControl ofWasteOils (Offical Gazette No. 26952) in Turkey[11].For \nthis purpose, PCBs,total halogens and chlorine results compared \nwith the limit values.The pollutants in sample 1 are upper the limit \nvalues given in the Regulation on Controlof Waste Oils for Category \nI. The Category I Waste Oil is available for recovery through refining \nand regeneration as feedstock or suitable for useas supplementary \nfuel in the facilities licensed by the Ministry of the Environment \nand Urbanization such ascement and/or lime kiln. The comparison \nof contaminated transformer oils and Category I Waste Oil are given \nin Table 3. According to this table, it was shown thatsample 1 results \n(PCBs, total halogens and chlorine) are over the limit values of \nCategory I Waste Oil.\nPCB-containing transformer from which sample 1 was taken \nis located in electricity generating facility (power plant) in \nunincorporated.  The transformer can be seen in Figure 2. The owner \nof the PCB-transformer must take measures as soon as practically \nand safely possible to contain and control any potential releases of \nPCBs. In any case the newly-identified PCB Transformer immediately \nregisters in the national database and must be disposed of in a carefully \ncontrolled manner in accordance with regulations administered by \nMinistry of Environment and Urbanization (MEU).\nFour major PCB disposal methods have been authorized by the \nMEU. These are as follows:\n1. High temperature combustion in incinerations and high efficiency \nboilers (if PCBs are not burnt at high enough temperatures, \ndioxin is formed and this substance, which is even more toxic \nthan the PCBs, would be released into the atmosphere),\n2. Chemical dechlorination,\n3. Landfilling and\n4. Alternate disposal techniques which achieve a level of \nperformance equivalent to an approved incinerator or boiler.\nThese highly specialized techniques are required to permanently \neliminate or reduce the threat of contamination from PCBs. Such \ntechnical specifications and specific conditions vary depending on the \nprofession to destroy PCBs on a tonnage scale.\nConclusion\nTwenty transformer oils were collected and analyzed as a main \nsource of PCBs into environment in Turkey. The levels of PCBs in \ntransformer oils were ranged from < 0.01 to 150 ppm. It was determined \nthat PCBlevels of one sample are overthe limit values of 50 ppm. \nInt J Metall Mater Eng                                                                                                                                                                                          IJMME, an open access journal                                                                                                                                          \nISSN: 2455-2372                                                                                                                                                                                                    Volume 1. 2015. 114\nCitation: Pelitli V , Doğan O, Köroğlu HJ (2015) Transformer Oils Potential for PCBs Contamination.
