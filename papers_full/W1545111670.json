    "abstract": "A novel synthesis of the title compound was achieved by direct amination using Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution (VNS) methodology. Reaction of 1,1,1-trimethylhydrazinium iodide with 3,5-dinitropyrazole in DMSO produces 4-amino-3,s-dinitro-1H-pyrazole as a 1:1 crystal solvate with DMSO. Recrystallization from water yields the monohydrated crystal. Recrystallization of the monohydrate from butyl acetate yields the compound in pure form. Crystallographic data and results of small-scale safety tests are reported. These data indicate that LLM-116 is a promising candidate as an insensitive high explosive.",
