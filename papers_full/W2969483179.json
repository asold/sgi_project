    "abstract": "Fault arc detection is an important technology to ensure the safe operation of electrical equipment and prevent electrical fires. The high-frequency noise of the arc current is one of the typical arc characteristics of almost all loads. In order to accurately detect arc faults in a low-voltage alternating-current (AC) system, a novel differential high-frequency current transformer (D-HFCT) sensor for collecting high-frequency arc currents was proposed. The sensitivity and frequency band of the designed sensor were verified to ensure that the acquisition requirements of the high-frequency current were satisfied. A series arc fault simulation experiment system was built, and resistive, inductive, and non-linear load and high-power shielding load experiments were carried out. Experiments showed that the sensor output signal was close to zero in the non-arc state, and the sensor output response was a high-frequency glitch in the arc state. The results were consistent for different loads, and the discrimination between normal and fault states was obvious, which proved that the sensor is suitable for series arc fault detection.",
