A minor fault on it\ncould seriously affect the reliability and stability of power system. However, oil-immersed\ntransformers which contain large quantity of insulating oil are susceptible to internal arcing\nfaults. Once the tank rupture or explosion occurs under overpressure due to the high-energy\narcing faults, its internal combustible substance would spray to nearby staffs and power equip-\nment and thus lead to disastrous consequences in personal, property and environmental safety.\nAccording to the law of energy conservation, power energy of the faults converts into heat,\nkinetic and other forms of energy during internal arc duration. In 2009, the task force of IEEE\npower transformer subcommittee summarized the following [1]: the overpressure phenome-\nnon inside transformer occurs when an internal arcing fault causes generation of large volume\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0133851 July 31, 2015 1/1 7\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Yan C, Hao Z, Zhang S, Zhang B, Zheng T\n(2015) Numerical Methods for the Analysis of Power\nTransformer Tank Deformation and Rupture Due to\nInternal Arcing Faults.

Alstom Grid provided\nsupport in the form of salary for author SZ, but did not\nhave any additional role in the study design, data\ncollection and analysis, decision to publish, or\npreparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests:Co-author Song Zhang is\nemployed by Alstom Grid, Redmond, WA. There are\nof decomposed gas; once the combined effect of the static overpressure and dynamic pressure\nwave propagation exceed the mechanical strength of the transformer tank, tank deformation or\nexplosion is inevitable.\nBeing aware of the great hazard of transformer internal pressure which rises sharply when\nlow-impedance faults occur, much theoretical and experimental effort on the tank overpres-\nsure, rupture and mitigation has been devoted since 1970s. The first significant contribution\nwas presented by W. R. Mahieu in [2]. Mahieu assumed that the oil is incompressible, based on\nwhich the amplitude of pressure induced by an arc in a gas blanket located at the top of the\ntank was computed. In 1988, a more accurate method was invented by M. Foata, M. Iorda-\nnescu, and C. Hardy, who built a 2D potential flow model and used finite element method to\nstudy the dynamic response of transformer tanks under overpressure regardless of the fact that\nthe oil is compressible and viscous [3]. Later in 2003, J. B. Dastous, A. Hamel, and M. Foata ini-\ntiated a method using semi-experiment to calculate the overpressures generated by diverse arcs\nfor different tank geometry parameters [4]. Recently in the CIGRE International conference\n2010, they discussed and analyzed the major causes of tank rupture, tank containment capabil-\nity and the performances of the protection devices[5].\nAs the computation capability advances, a 3-D numerical tool was presented in the study of\ncomplex physical phenomena after transformer internal faults [6]. The kernel of the numerical\ntool is based on a simplified 5-equation model proposed in [7], which was to describe the\nhydrodynamic behavior of the compressible 2-phase flows. In addition, physical effects such as\nelectromagnetic forces, viscous, thermal and gravity effects were taken into account. In [6], it\nwas assumed that the gas bubble is created instantaneously and the energy of the internal faults\nis used to entirely decompose the oil rather than increase the pressure. In fact, arc energy\ninjects continually within the faults duration. The quantity and the internal pressure of gas\nbubble increase accordingly. As a result, there are obvious variances between their calculated\nand measured results in [6].\nIn 2010, a refined 3D numerical simulation method about mechanical effects of transformer\ninternal faults was presented in [8]. With the assumption that the gas generation process from\ndecomposition of the oil is adiabatic and the plates are modeled by shell elements without\nthickness, the paper simulated the fairly complex rupture of transformer tank, especially for\nthe chimney, under overpressure caused by low-impedance arcing faults. Besides, A. Hackl and\nP. Hamberger put forward a static finite element analysis of a transformer tank under static\noverpressure with three material models [9]. Unfortunately, this work fails to solve the actual\nmechanical behaviors of tank wall due to the fact that the dynamic process of overpressure\ninside the tank was ignored. The previous investigations focus, including but not limited to the\ntransformer tank rupture and mitigation, provides encouraging and representative results\nwhich are useful for tank structural design and fault overpressure analysis.\nIn order to study the transient characteristics of transformer tank under internal overpressure\ndue to high-energy arcing faults, the whole process was considered as a particular acoustic and\nmechanical problem in this paper. Firstly, the basic models of transformer internal faults over-\npressure, tank mechanical deformation and acoustics-mechanical field coupling were proposed.\nSecondly, according to the practical geometric and nameplate parameters, a 3-D simulation\nmodel for the representative 360 MVA/220 kV power transformer was built as a study case.\nBesides, the transformer tank was considered as elastic-plastic body, described by a trilinear iso-\ntropic hardening model, for calculating accurately in our work. Thirdly, to illustrate the effective-\nness of the proposed method, a 17.3MJ and a 6.3MJ arcing fault were assumed and the\ntransformer internal overpressure distribution, wave propagation, von-Mises stresses distribu-\ntion were solved by taking advantage of 3-D FEM. The simulation results show that there is a\npositive correlation between the mechanical stress and the overpressure amplitude, which is\nAnalysis of Power Transformer Tank Deformation and Rupture\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0133851 July 31, 2015 2/1 7\nno patents, products in development or marketed\nproducts to declare.

Rapid fault clearance is an effective way to reduce the faults energy\ninjection. Furthermore, both the pressure and mechanical stress distribution are far from being\nuniform inside the tank and the stress is always concentrated at some particular joints.\nMethods\nTransformer Internal Fault Overpressure Model\nGenerally, low impedance faults, such as turn-to-turn faults, are in the form of arc inside\npower transformer tanks once the oil or other insulating medium lose their dielectric proper-\nties. The energy generated by the arc is [10]:\nWarc ¼\nðDt\n0\nuarciarcdt ð1Þ\nwhere Warc (kJ) is the total arc energy;uarc (V) is the voltage drop across the arc;iarc (kA) is the\narc current;Δt (s) is its duration.\nIn order to facilitate the integral of (1), it is assumed that the arc voltageuarc is always posi-\ntive and the arc currentiarc is changed into absolute value:\nWarc ¼\nðDt\n0\nuarcjiarcjdt ð2Þ\nRegardless of the voltage drop near the electrode and extinguish peak of the arc, it is consid-\nered that the strength of electric field per unit length of arc column is constant during each cur-\nrent half wave [11]. In fact, the effective arc length is longer than the insulation distance in\nmany cases and it is related to the pressure as well. According to [5, 12], a more accurate\nexpression is recommended:\nuarc ¼ 55larc\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\np=p0\nq\nð3Þ\nwhere larc (m) is its length which is relevant to the fault severity andp/p0 represents the absolute\npressure, the atmospheric pressurep0 equals to 101.3 kPa.\nIn order to discuss the method to estimate the arc current, a single-phase two-winding\ntransformer turn-to-turn arcing fault equivalent circuit was provided inFig 1.\nAccording to the Kirchhoff’s current law, the arc currentiarc is equal to the sum of primary\nside currenti11 (kA) and inter-turn fault circulationi12 (kA). The transformer models presently\nbeing used of winding faults, have some deficiencies [13– 15]. The differences among these mod-\nels are the degree of approximation of reactance and inductance parameters. In this paper, the\ncommon method proposed in [13] is used to calculate the arc energy considering that its error is\nacceptable. Hence, the transformer turn-to-turn arcing fault energy can be calculated by\nWarc ¼ 55larc\nðDt\n0\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\np=p0\nq\ni11þi12jj dt ð4Þ\nBased on the law of energy conservation, the released arc energy must be converted into\nenergy loss, thermal transmission, chemical energy, mechanical energy and other forms [16].\nHere, the energy to heat the gas bubble at constant volume can be denoted asWheat (kJ) and its\ndifferential form is:\ndWheat ¼ kheat dWarc ¼ kheat Parcdt ð5Þ\nAnalysis of Power Transformer Tank Deformation and Rupture\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0133851 July 31, 2015 3/1 7\nThe heat transfer coefficientkheat determines the fraction of the arc energy which contrib-\nutes to the gas internal pressure rise. The typical value forkheat is 22% from the value ranging\nfrom 15~45% [12]. Parc (kW) is the arc power.\nAccording to [12], the volume fraction of hydrogen, acetylene, methane and ethylene in\nmixed gas are 70%, 15%, 10% and 5% respectively. Besides, with the accumulation ofWheat, the\ngas internal temperatureTgas rises up constantly. This dynamic heating process at constant vol-\nume can be expressed as the following form:\ndQgas ¼ dWheat ¼ CvmgasdTgas ð6Þ\nwhere Qgas (kJ) is the quantity of heat;Cv is the speciﬁc heat at constant volume of gas mixture,\nestimated to be 2.84kJ/kg/C1 K; mgas (kg) is the gas mass.\nThe internal pressure of the gas is determined using the perfect gas equation. Its differential\nform is:\nVgasdpgas ¼ mgasRdTgas ð7Þ\nwhere pgas (kPa) is the gas internal pressure;Vgas (m3) is the gas volume; the gas constantR is\nequal to 1.002 kJ/kg/C1 K for the molar mass of gas mixture of 8.3 g/mol.\nBringing (5), (6) into (7), it can be obtained the relationship between arc energy and corre-\nsponding gas internal pressure at average volume/C22V gas:\ndpgas ¼ kheat ðg /C0 1Þ\n/C22V gas\nParcdt ð8Þ\nwhere γ is the speciﬁc heat capacity ratio of 1.364 for the gas mixture in this paper.\nCorrespondingly, the change in temperature during arc duration can also be calculated as\ndT ¼ kheat\nmgasCv\nParcdt ð9Þ\nA logarithmic expression was proposed by SERGI [17,18], and two experimental test cam-\npaigns of 62 tests had been carried out from 2002 to 2004 in France and Brazil. Their investiga-\ntion demonstrated that with the accumulation of arc energy, the gas volume generated\nincreases more and more slowly, which can be approximately regarded as a process of the\nFig 1.

In our work, the logarithmic function relation is used in this\npaper considering that its error is acceptable:\nVgas ¼ 0:44lnðWarc þ 5474:3Þ/C0 3:8 ð10Þ\nAs the aforementioned analysis, the surrounding liquid inertia prevents the expansion of\ngas bubble, the pressure differenceΔp (kPa) on the interface is given as\nDp ¼ pgas /C0 p0 /C0 poil /C0 2soil=rgas ð11Þ\nwhere poil (kPa) is the oil pressure at fault location;σoil/rgas is the ratio between the surface ten-\nsion coefﬁcient of the decomposed gas and its radius of curvature and the surface tension coef-\nﬁcient is evaluated at 27×10−3 N/m.\nThe propagation and superposition of the pressure waves, which is generated by internal\narcing fault, plays a significant role in tank rupture. Taking into account the attenuation of\npressure wave propagation in the insulating oil, the transient pressure acoustic governing equa-\ntion is given as [19]\n1\nrc2\n@2pt\n@t2 /C0r rpt\nr /C0 q /C0 1\nrc2\n4m\n3 þ mB\n/C18/C19 @rpt\n@t\n/C20/C21\n¼ Q ð12Þ\nwhere ρ (kg/m3) refers to the medium density;c (m/s) denotes the speed of pressure wave prop-\nagation; ρc2 is called bulk modulus;t (s) is time;pt (kPa) is the pressureﬁeld; q is the dipole\nsource (N/m3); Q is monopole source (1/s2); the dynamic viscosityμand the bulk viscosityμB\nare 5.3×10−3 Pa/C1 s and 0.2 Pa/C1 s respectively. The pressureﬁeld pt is the sum of the background\npressure ﬁeld pb (kPa) and the pressure differenceΔp (kPa).\nTank Wall Mechanical Model\nThe overpressure due to high-energy arcing faults usually leads to mechanical stress and defor-\nmation to transformer tank. The mechanical field characteristics are governed by the three gov-\nerning equations, which are the transient equilibrium equation, the constitution equation and\nthe compatibility equation, respectively [20]. The transient equilibrium equation (load-stress)\nwith the structural inertia introduced is expressed as\nr\nt\n@2u\n@t2 /C0r/C1 st ¼ Fv ð13Þ\nwhere ρt (kg/m3) is the material density;u (m) is the displacement of the inﬁnitesimal; σt (N/\nm2) is the stress tensor,Fv (N/m3) is the total load. Its value equals to the ratio between the\noverpressure ps (Pa) acting on tank wall and the thicknessd (m) of tank wall.\nAccording to the Duhamel-Hooke's law, the constitution equation (stress-strain) is\nexpressed as follow:\nst /C0 s0 ¼ C : ðεt /C0 ε0 /C0 εp /C0 εthÞð 14Þ\nwhere σ0 and ε0 are initial stress and strain respectively; C is the 4th order elasticity tensor; ':'\nstands for the double-dot tensor product (or double contraction);εp is the plastic strain tensor;\nthe impact of the thermal strain sensorεp is ignored.\nAnalysis of Power Transformer Tank Deformation and Rupture\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0133851 July 31, 2015 5/1 7\nThe total strain tensorε is then written in terms of the displacementu gradient as the com-\npatibility equation:\nε ¼ 1\n2 ½ðruÞþð r uÞ\nT\n/C138ð 15Þ\nThe displacement and deformation on the tank under internal overpressure can introduce a\nstructural acceleration based on the second derivatives of the displacements with respect to\ntime. From the acoustics field perspective, this outward-pointing acceleration acting on the\nboundaries between the solid and the fluid plays a loss role in acoustics pressure boundary [21]:\n/C0 n /C1/C0\n1\nr ðrpt /C0 qÞ\n/C20/C21\n¼/C0 n /C1 €u ð16Þ\nwhere n is the unit normal vector andü is the acceleration.\nAcoustics-mechanical Field Coupling Calculation\nAs shown inFig 2, there is a multi-field coupling relation between the internal overpressure\nacoustics field and the tank mechanical field. On the one hand, the combined effects of the\nstatic overpressure and dynamic pressure wave propagation result in the increase of mechani-\ncal stresses that acts on the tank wall, up to rupture sometimes. On the other hand, the\nFig 2.

Additionally, the geometric variation of the tank wall under\nthe impact from overpressure could influence the wave propagation and change the original\npressure field distribution.\nPower Transformer 3-D Simulation Model\nTransformer Geometric Model. According to the practical geometric and nameplate\nparameters, a 3-D simulation model for the representative 360 MVA/220 kV power transformer\n(14 m × 5.6 m × 7.6 m) was built as a study case. The simulation transformer 3D geometric\nmodel is provided inFig 3below, where the numbers①~ ③refer to three measuring positions,\ni.e., the broadside, frontal and top faces of the tank, respectively. The letters‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ refer\nto the three phases inside the transformer. Since the mesh size and number of elements could\nsignificantly influence the calculation time and the accuracy of the simulation results, the mesh\nmodel are consisted of 135338 tetrahedral elements, 41730 triangular elements, 3694 edge ele-\nment and 338 vertex elements. Moreover, some relevant parameters are listed inTable 1and the\nacoustic properties of transformer elements involved are summarized inTable 2.\nMechanical Property of Tank wall.The transformer tank is made of S355J0 carbon struc-\ntural steel and its elastic-plastic behavior is described by a trilinear isotropic hardening model\nin our work. As shown inFig 4, the first stage is the linear Young's modules of S355J0 steel up\nto the yield stressR\np = 355 MPa where the gradient is 200 GPa [22]. In this stage, the material\npresents elastic deformation without any unrecoverable behavior. When the tank material\ndeforms beyond the strain that elastic deformation persists, the permanent plastic deformation\noccurs. The tank wall tensile strength is taken as 560 MPa. Once the mechanical stress reaches\nthe tensile strength, the material would be ripped. Additionally, the Poisson ratio of S355J0 car-\nbon structural steel used is 0.3 and its density is 7850 kg/m\n3.\nThe acoustic and mechanical effects of the arcing faults inside the transformer are calculated\nnumerically using the FEM supported by the acoustic-solid interaction module in COMSOL\nMultiphysics (version 4.3a) within the transient state [23]. In FEM calculation, the Multi-fron-\ntal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver has been applied for the transient calculation. The\ntime step has been set as 1μs in later three examples according to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy\ncriterion proposed in [24]. The simulations were performed on an Inter(R) Xeon(R) E5620,\nFig 3.

In the simulation tests, a 5% turn-to-turn fault in phase A high-voltage(HV) winding\nside and a 1.25% turn-to-turn fault in phase C low-voltage(LV) winding side were applied. As\nshown inFig 5, the cumulated arc energy curves in the examples are approximately a linear\nfunction of the simulation time. In the first example, the 5% inter-turn fault generates more\nthan 17MJ arc energy within 80ms. Similarly, nearly 6.3MJ arc energy was released by 1.25%\ninter-turn fault in the second example.\nExample One: 5% Turn-to-turn Fault\nA 5% turn-to-turn fault was provoked outside the phase A high voltage winding side and the\nfault location is at 1/3 of the total winding height. The fault occurs at 0 ms, and the arc duration\nis 80 ms corresponding to the average response time of a traditional circuit breaker.Fig 6illus-\ntrates the transformer tank internal overpressure distribution caused by 17.3MJ arcing fault at\n20ms, 40ms, 60ms and 80ms, respectively.\nCorrespondingly, the transformer tank internal overpressure curves at three positions have\nbeen plotted inFig 7.\nBy analyzing the simulation results about the overpressure characteristics inside tank, some\nconclusions have been drawn below.\n1. As shown in Figs6 and 7, the pressure level inside tank rises up drastically with the accumu-\nlation of arc energy. The maximum transient rate is more than 30MPa/s. When the simula-\ntion time evolves to 80ms, the average pressure level at the three locations is greater than\nTable 1.

It is also found that the pressure is not spatially uniform inside the tank, the positions close\nto the arc actually has much larger pressure than other regions. This is because the mechani-\ncal deformation of the transformer tank has absorbed a certain amount of arc energy during\nthe transfer of pressure wave. The further the position is away from the fault center, the\nsmaller the pressure measures.\nFig 4.

Since the pressure of fault center varies with the change of arc energy and also considering\nthe impact of metal components and insulation fabrics on reflection of pressure waves, the\nthree internal pressure rise curves corresponding to the three points are different from each\nother with respect to the frequency of variation on curves though they share some similari-\nties in the increase trend.\nTo understand the essence of tank deformation or explosion, the tank mechanical behavior\nunder overpressure has been simulated in the test, which is the key factor to determine whether\nor not the transformer can withstand overpressure caused by high-energy arc without being\nruptured. The von-Mises stresses evolution in tank wall over time was plotted inFig 8.\nAs shown inFig 8, we solved the transient mechanical effects of arcing faults within the\ntransformer tank: as the internal pressure varies, the mechanical stress in the tank has a signifi-\ncant increase accordingly. At 40ms after initiation of the fault, the von-Mises stresses have\nexceeded 360MPa in the joint between frontal face and chimney (close to the fault location),\nwhich are less than the tensile strength of steel, but more than the yield stress. It means that\nthese parts of tank have been unrecoverable deformed without being ripped. Furthermore,\nwhen the arcing fault duration is longer than 60ms, the von-Mises stresses rise up to 560MPa\nalong the joints on the chimney bottom. This value reaches the tensile strength of steel. As a\nresult, the tank wall has already ruptured.\nExample Two: 1.25% Turn-to-turn Fault\nA 1.25% turn-to-turn fault was provoked outside the phase C low voltage winding, and the\nfault location is at 2/3 of the total winding height in example two. With the same parameters\nand conditions as applied in the above example, the transient mechanical stress distribution in\ntank wall was given inFig 9.\nFig 6.

As demonstrated inFig 9A– 9C, the mechanical stresses in\nthe tank are smaller than 355 MPa (the steel yield stress) during the first 60ms. Namely, when\nthe accumulated arc energy is less than 5 MJ, this type of transformer tank could resist the\nimpact from internal overpressure with the elastic deformation. Then, when the total energy\nrises, a higher stress concentration, more than 355 MPa but less than 560 MPa, can be seen in\nsome joints at 80 ms. At this value, these local joints in the transformer tank experienced plastic\ndeformation rather than rupture.\nAnalysis and Discussion\nPreviously, both the acoustics and mechanical effects of the internal arcing faults within the\nsame transformer were simulated in the above examples. The fault severity and fault location\nin these two examples are different from each other. By comparing their results, some conclu-\nsions have been drawn below.\n1. The simulation examples reveal that when an electrical arcing fault occurs inside trans-\nformer tank, a huge volume of explosive gas is created within tens of milliseconds. This\nhuge gas yielded by the fault stimulates pressure wave propagation and overpressure inside\ntank. Once the superposition of static overpressure and dynamic pressure due to the wave\npropagation exceed the mechanical strength of the transformer tank, tank deformation or\nexplosion is inevitable. Moreover, it appears from the above two examples that there is a\npositive correlation between the severity of tank deformation and the arc energy.\n2. The arc energy is determined by arc voltage, current and its duration. In general, the magni-\ntude of the arcing fault, especially arc current associated X/R (ratio of reactance to resis-\ntance) of the circuit, is uncontrollable. If the faults can be cleared in a timely manner, less\nenergy would be released. In the second example, the von-Mises stresses in tank wall do not\nexceed the elastic limit in the first 60 ms, though the internal overpressure is more than 0.2\nMPa (the maximum operating pressure) at that time. Obviously, if the short circuit fault in\nthis case can be cleared in less than 60 ms, the transformer tank would endure the internal\noverpressure without any permanent plastic deformation. As mentioned above, the rapid\nfault clearance is an effective way to control the released arc energy as well as to prevent\ntransformer tank permanent deformation, even explosion.\n3. In the aforementioned simulations, there appear some conspicuous stress concentrative\npoints in connecting parts of tank wall, such as the joint at the chimney to the tank wall,\njoint at the cover to tank wall and joint at the tank wall to the base plate. In order to prevent\nthe tank from unrecoverable deformation or explosion, the mechanical stresses in tank wall,\nespecially in these highest stress parts, must be kept lower than the steel yield stress. In other\nwords, one good way to improve the strength of transformer tank is increasing the mechani-\ncal property of the local high stress areas.\n4. The inner diameter of the duct connecting tank and conservator is only 80 mm, and its\nlength is more than 11000 mm, which has played a role in damping overpressure wave\npropagation. As shown in Figs6– 9, the acoustics and mechanical effects of the arcing fault\nwithin the conservator are negligible. In fact, the air space in conservator has considerable\npressure enduring capability due to its excellent compressibility. Hence an expansion of\ncross-sectional area of the connection duct or extra pipes with a larger inner diameter which\nAnalysis of Power Transformer Tank Deformation and Rupture\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0133851 July 31, 2015 13 / 17\nFig 9. von-Mises stress in transformer tank with 6.3MJ arcing fault.(A) t = 20ms.

With the proposed model, the dynamic propaga-\ntion and distribution of the overpressure wave are described. The tank transient deformation\nand physical rupture, particularly resulting from internal arcing faults, are also explained. The\nsimulation results show that the pressure and mechanical stress increase significantly within a\nfew milliseconds after an internal fault occurs. During this very short time, an approximate pro-\nportional relationship exists between the overpressure amplitude and the energy released by the\narc fault. The overpressure wave propagates along the tank wall and is prone to exert huge stress\non some connecting parts, such as the joint at the chimney to the tank wall, joint at the cover to\ntank wall and joint at the tank wall to the base plate. The longer the fault lasts, the higher the\npossibility of occurrence of tank deformation at these points is. Therefore, the quality and condi-\ntion of these areas of highest stress are critical in determining the capability of transformer tank\nto withstand the high energy arcing fault without being deformed or ruptured.\nMore importantly, the theoretical model and simulation method proposed in this paper pro-\nvide a guidance for fault characteristics analysis and mitigation of oil-immersed transformers,\nwhich could be an economic and safe alternative approach of costly and dangerous field tests.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Text.
