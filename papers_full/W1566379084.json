  "full_text": "Chapter 5\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on\nAcoustic Emission Method\nWojciech Sikorski and Krzysztof Walczak\nAdditional information is available at the end of the chapter\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n1. Introduction\nPartial discharge (PD) diagnostics is a proven method to assess the condition of a power\ntransformer. Too high level of PD in a transformer may quickly degrade its insulation system\nand lead to damage. If PDs are detected and located quickly, then the transformer may be\nrepaired or replaced, thus preventing power outages (Bartnikas, 2002; Gulski & Smitt, 2007).\nPartial discharges in power transformers in service are most often detected with DGA\n(Dissolved Gas Analysis) and afterwards located using acoustic emission method (AE) (Duval,\n2008; Lundgaard, 1992; Bengtsson & Jönsson, 1997).\nIn regard to the possibility of location of defects generating partial discharges, acoustic\nemission is an important diagnostic method of power transformers and other HV equipment.\nWidely applied techniques for the fault location based on AE method are: (i) measurement of\nthe time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the acoustic signals, (ii) measurement of the acoustic\nsignal amplitude in different areas of a transformer tank (standard auscultatory technique,\nSAT), (iii) advanced auscultatory technique (AAT), (iv) estimation of the direction of arrival\n(DOA) of the acoustic signal based on the phased-array signal processing (Markalous et al.,\n2008; Tenbohlen et al., 2010; Qing et al., 2010).\nMore and more frequent breakdowns of large power transformers, often ending with fire\ndifficult to put out, compel to more critical evaluation of traditional diagnostics techniques\nbased mostly on periodic testing. Ageing of network infrastructure causes that the possibility\nof insulation system damage resulting from defect developing in short period is becoming\nmore and more real. This fact favours different kinds of monitoring systems, which, through\ncontinuous investigation of the most important transformer parameters, allow to early\ndetection of coming damage.\n© 2013 Sikorski and Walczak; licensee InTech.

Therefore the PD intensity monitoring as well as monitoring of its dynamics changes in\ntime, in selected, neuralgic points of transformer seem to be a very important indicator\ninforming on coming damage.\nCurrently there are only a few commercial systems for partial discharge monitoring in the power\ntransformer in the world. These systems are based on the method of measuring AE ( Acoustic\nEmission) or UHF (Ultra High Frequency) signal and offer limited capabilities (Markalous et al.,\n2003; Rutgers et al., 2003). A drawback of these systems is that as autonomous devices they do not\ncooperate with superior systems, and only transmit information or alerts about the status of the\nunit, what makes difficult a subsequent analysis of the causes of failure and looking for correla‐\ntion with other parameters recorded by the monitoring system of the transformer.\nProject assumptions of the partial discharge online monitoring system, developed at the Insti‐\ntute of Electric Power Engineering of Poznan University of Technology, were quite different. The\nsystem was, of course, so designed and constructed that it can work as a standalone device, what\ncorresponds to the demand on emergency short-term monitoring (e.g. by day or a few days).\nHowever, the authors designing device have made all effort to ensure that it can be also integrat‐\ned with any system of full monitoring of the transformer, such as e.g. Mikronika SYNDIS ES, which\nhas already been installed on tens transformers in the European transmission networks. Through\nopen collaboration of systems, the data collected by the PD monitoring system are visible in the\nsuperior system, so that it is possible to perform a full correlation analysis with other recorded\nparameters (load, voltage, oil temperature, OLTC operations etc.). The first prototype implemen‐\ntation of the integrated system for PD monitoring and SYNDIS ES was performed on one of the\npower substations. Currently the authors have already got the annual experience related to the\nwork of the system, what will be discussed later in the chapter.\n2. Superior power transformers monitoring system — Mikronika SYNDIS\nES\nIn the power transformer monitoring Mikronika SYNDIS ES system, which has been installed\non a few substations, the functionality of the expert system was acquired due to implementa‐\ntion of the knowledge base consisting of mathematical functions and models of phenomena\noccurring in a power transformer. Basing on logical operations and implemented inference\nrules, the expert functions generate (in online mode) summary alarms, emergency signals and\nprompts for substation staff. Expert functions assign specific logical value to the rules and\nrelations contained in the knowledge base. On their basis, the transformer condition is defined\nas Normal, Warning, Alarm or Emergency. The simulating calculations conducted in real-time\nare significant elements of evaluation of power transformer condition. Therefore, the special‐\nized mathematical model of thermal state was elaborated basing on the elementary relations\npresented in the IEC 60076-7 – Part 7: Loading guide for oil-immersed power transformers . The\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications92\nmodel includes relation between load losses and the temperature mean of the separate bushing\nand tap changer position. The model was expanded on the work of the three power transformer\ncoils as well as the relation between cooling effectiveness and number of working coolers or\nradiator batteries was included in the model. Basing on simulations, possibilities of a power\ntransformer load at the current surroundings temperature are calculated every minute. In\norder to efficiently manage the resources, besides load and temperature analysis one can\ndistinguish the following thematic groups in the monitoring system:\n• moisture content in oil,\n• dissolved gas analysis,\n• cooling system,\n• on-load tap changer,\n• bushings,\n• partial discharges.\n3. Partial discharge online monitoring system\nThe prototype system for partial discharge monitoring presented in this chapter is the effect\nof several years of research, the results of which have already been presented, among others\nin (Sikorski & Walczak, 2010; Sikorski, 2012). In the mentioned literature items one can find\nmore information on project assumptions and criteria for the selection of individual compo‐\nnents of the system.\nThe system works basing on the detection of acoustic emission pulses recorded by piezoelectric\ncontact sensors (PAC WD), which are mounted on the transformer tank. A practical solution\nenabling easy mounting of AE sensor with a constant force to the tank is the use of special handles\nfitted with strong permanent magnets and such solution was used in the prototype. The pream‐\nplifier is also mounted in the handle. The amplifier and filters are located in standard 19-inch, fully\nscreened industrial housing. From the conditioning module signals are transmitted to the\nacquisition module. Its integral element is a powerful workstation, based on multi-core architec‐\nture, with specialized software and ultrafast acquisition card installed. Procedures for the\nacquisition and analysis of data are implemented in National Instrument LabView program‐\nming environment and realized in real time. Acquisition module, like conditioning module, was\nplaced in a separate screened industrial housing, compatible with mechanics standard 19-inch.\nThe housing is waterproof and equipped with automatic temperature control system.\nThe system is designed for continuous, multi-month fieldwork, therefore specialized software\nallows not only for continuous registration of partial discharge activity, but also for correctness\nof the work of the system itself (e.g. temperature and humidity inside the enclosure or\noperation of electronic measuring circuits). The program is equipped with advanced data\nprocessing modules, which make it easier to evaluate events and noise filtering. In addition to\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n93\nthe registration and calculation of basic PD parameters (like the number of pulses, their energy\nand amplitude), the program creates also event log, whose goal is to inform, with a specified\nfrequency (service station or the superior system), about the work of the PD monitoring system\nor threat to the transformer resulting from the intensity discharge growth. External commu‐\nnication is provided using a GSM modem (with an additional antenna) or LAN/WLAN\nnetwork. The second solution was used in case of cooperation with the superior system of\ntransformer monitoring SYNDIS ES.\nThe schematic diagram of developed partial discharge on-line monitoring system, which was\nin detail described in (Sikorski & Walczak, 2010), was presented in figure 1.\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of developed partial discharge on-line monitoring system\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications94\n4. Partial discharge location techniques in power transformer\n4.1. Standard and advanced auscultatory technique\nStandard auscultatory technique (SAT) is one of the simplest methods of PD location. It\ninvolves the AE amplitude measurement in different areas of a transformer tank and thereby\nin different distance from the PD source. The SAT allows finding an area on a tank, in which\nthe pulses of the highest amplitude/energy are recorded. One may assume that in this location\nunder the surface of the tank, some depth in the object, the source of partial discharges’ source\nis located.\nThe main advantages of the method are: (i) the possibility to carry out the measurements with\none sensor, (ii) straightforward measurement procedure, (iii) the possibility of detection of the\nmulti-source discharges, the occurrence of which in old transformers with aged insulation\nsystem is very probable (Sikorski et al., 2007, 2008, 2010).\nUnfortunately,  while  employing  the  SAT  method,  very  often  one  may  expect  errors  in\nlocation of PD sources. This is because the amplitude of AE signal depends not only on\nthe distance of a piezoelectric sensor from the discharge source (which is the basis of this\nmeasuring technique), but also depends on the energy fluctuations of partial discharges.\nTherefore  satisfactory  accuracy  in  the  PD  location  with  the  SAT  technique  can  be  ob‐\ntained only when discharges are stable (not self-extinguishing) and their energy does not\nchange in time for the duration of the measurement. But taking into consideration that PD\nis  a  non-linear,  dynamic  phenomenon  and  has  strongly  stochastic  character,  this  ideal\nsituation is not very probable during the lengthy measurements performed on a real high\nvoltage  power  transformer.  The  influence  of  small  fluctuations  of  the  PD  energy  on\naccuracy of discharges location with the use of standard auscultatory technique can easily\nbe mitigated when one may determine the value of simple moving average (SMA) of the\nregistered AE pulses’ energy, e, and monitor the value of their standard deviation, σ. In\ncase of fluctuations of the PD pulses’ energy (e.g. their apparent charge q changes in a\nwide range, from hundreds pC to some nC), the procedure of AE-pulses energy averag‐\ning, does not give satisfactory results. The largest errors of the PD source location while\nemploying the SAT method occur when the partial discharge activity is not-stable and after\nthe period of high intensity we observe their extinction for a certain time.\nIn order to improve the efficiency and reliability of auscultatory technique, the authors\npropose to simultaneously monitor in each measuring point on the surface of a transform‐\ner tank the simple moving average of: (i) AE waveforms energy, SMA(e), and (ii) the PD\napparent charge, SMA(q). Additionally, the parameter p is introduced that is equal to the\nquotient of the measured values SMA(e) end SMA(q). Due to this operation, the correct‐\ned value of the AE pulses energy depends mostly on the acoustic waves’ attenuation effect,\nand so depends on the distance between a piezoelectric sensor and the PD source. The\ninfluence  of  the  changes  of  PD  energy  on  the  result  of  the  PD  source  location  is  then\nnegligible.\nThe proposed algorithm of the AAT method consists of the following steps:\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n95\nStep 1. Using the conventional electric method, identify the transformer phase, in which the\npartial discharges occur.\nStep 2. On the transformer tank mark a grid of the measurement points, consisting of m-rows\nand n-columns (see Figure 2).\nStep 3. For the given measurement point a(i,j), where i=1,…,m and j=1,…,n, simultaneously\nregister r-values of partial discharge apparent charge q=(q1,q2,…,qr) and s AE-waveforms\nX=[x1,x2,…,xs].\nStep 4. For the registered AE waveforms [x1,x2,…,xs] calculate their signal energy e=(e1,e2,..,es).\nStep 5 . For the registered values of the apparent charge ( q1,q2,..,qr) and the calculated AE\nwaveforms energy ( e1,e2,..,es) determine their simple moving average (SMA): SMA(q) and\nSMA(e).\nStep 6. Calculate standard deviation σ of SMA(e).\nStep 7. If σ ≤ 0.1 stop the acquisition, else repeat steps 3 through 6.\nStep 8 . Calculate the value of parameter p, which takes into account the influence of PD\nenergy fluctuations on the energy of registered AE pulses in time for the duration of the\nmeasurements.\n p =\nSMA(e)\nSMA(q)   (1)\nStep 9. Repeat steps 3 through 8 for all measurement points.\nStep 10. Create matrix P=[pi,j].\nStep 11. Create matrix Pnorm=[pnormi,j], which constitutes normalized values of matrix P in the\nrange [0;1]:\npnormi, j\n=\n( pi, j - pmin)\n( pmax - pmin)  (2)\nStep 12 . On the base of the Pnorm and the bilinear interpolation function generate a high\nresolution intensity graph (called Acoustic Emission Map).\nStep 13.  Superimpose the Acoustic Emission Map  image on the photograph or construction\ndrawing of the investigated transformer’s phase, to find on the tank the areas which are the\nclosest to the PD source.\nBecause the Acoustic Emission Map shows the result of PD source location on the 2D plane (see\nFig. 3), it is recommended, if possible, to perform the additional measurements with the TDOA\ntriangulation technique, by placing the AE sensors on the tank wall close to the area of highest\np values localized with AAT.\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications96\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of AAT measurement procedure\nFigure 3. Two-dimensional visualization (Acoustic Emission Map) of PD-source location results in advanced auscultato‐\nry technique (AAT).\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n97\nThe most important modification, comparing to the SAT method, is application of the\nparameter p which, to a very significant degree, minimizes the negative influence of the\ntemporal changes of PD energy on the defect location results. This positive feature is illustrated\nby a simulation shown in figure 4. For simplification, it was assumed that the defect is present\nin the ‘B’ phase of the transformer, and the AE pulses were registered only in 7 measuring\npoints. In the first case, it was assumed that the partial discharges are stable and their energy\ndoes not change in time for the duration of the measurements. Of course, with such an idealistic\nand almost unrealistic assumption, both techniques achieve identical and correct result of the\ndefect location (Fig. 4a). As for the second analysed case, when energy of PD varies (fluctuate)\nduring the acoustic emission signals’ measurements, only the AAT technique allows to obtain\nthe proper location of the defect (Fig. 4b).\nThe on-site PD measurement using a standard IEC-60270 PD detector is complicated. There‐\nfore, the new AAT method is dedicated mainly for the transformer manufacturing plants and the\nrepair companies. However, modern PD-detectors with the integrated noise-gating channel for\nnoise-suppression via an external antenna and the software for noise reduction and filtering may\nalso expand the AAT usage to transformers installed at substation (Kraetge et al., 2010).\nFigure 4. The diagram illustrating the result of PD location employing the parameter SMA(e) (standard auscultatory\ntechnique) and parameter p (advanced auscultatory technique) in case when the apparent charge of partial discharg‐\nes is: a) stable, and b) varying in time during the measurement.\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications98\nDue to a low sensitivity of the PD detection procedure using acoustic emission method, the\nAAT method is the best for location of the defects that are the source of discharges with high\nenergy (e.g. surface and creeping discharges, sparks), or defects that are close to a transformer\ntank (e.g. discharges in bushing and near the winding at the bushing connection, on the surface\nof outer pressboard barriers and spacers, etc.). Unfortunately, location of the internal PD\nsources (e.g. within the winding), is very difficult or even impossible. It concerns not only the\nuse of AAT method, but any other technique that is based on acoustic emission.\nFurthermore, it should be stressed, that complex and non-homogeneous internal construction\nof the transformer (pressboard barriers, supporting beams made of wood or phenolic resin\netc.) and transformer tank (corrugated walls, magnetic or non-magnetic shields, stiffeners,\ngussets or ribs reinforcing the mechanical strength, welds etc.) impedes a proper interpretation\nof the AAT results because it causes a strong suppression of the acoustic signal.\n4.2. Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) technique\nThe PD source location based on TDOA technique is usually applied during on-site diagnostic\ntests of large power transformers. At least four AE sensors are used for spatial location of a\ndefect PD(x, y, z) in transformer tank. The sensors theoretically are fixed in different distances\nfrom the PD source (Fig. 5). The position of the defect is estimated basing on measured time\ndifference of arrival of acoustic signals. In order to find the coordinates of defect one should\nsolve the following nonlinear system of equations:\n(x - xs1)2 + (y - ys1)2 + (z - zs1)2 =(νoil ∙T )2 (3)\n(x - xs2)2 + (y - ys2)2 + (z - zs2)2 =(νoil ∙(T + t12))2 (4)\n(x - xs3)2 + (y - ys3)2 + (z - zs3)2 =(νoil ∙(T + t13))2 (5)\n(x - xs4)2 + (y - ys4)2 + (z - zs4)2 =(νoil ∙(T + t14))2 (6)\nwhere: x, y, z – unknown PD-source coordinates in space, T – unknown acoustic wave\npropagation time from PD-source to the nearest sensor numbered as S1, x S1..4, yS1...4, zS1…4 -\nCartesian coordinates of the four AE sensors S1...S4, t12, t13, t14 - propagation time delay between\nthe sensor 1 and the sensors 2, 3 and 4 respectively (t12 < t13 < t14), voil – acoustic wave propagation\nvelocity in transformer oil (1413 m/s at 20ºC, 1300 m/s at 50ºC, 1200 m/s at 80ºC).\nThis nonlinear system of equations can be solved with one of direct (non-iterative) solver\nalgorithms or with a least square iterative algorithm, which efficiency strongly depends on\ninitial values selected by user.\nThe most common errors in accurate location of PD source coordinates using TDOA technique\nin large power transformers result from:\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n99\n• simplifying assumption that the acoustic wave propagates only in oil with the velocity voil\n< 1500 m/s. This ignores the fact that acoustic wave propagates in transformer tank wall with\nvelocity 5100 m/s as well.\n• incorrect time-of-arrival estimation of signal propagating along the shortest geometric path.\nIn regard to the fact that the velocity in metal is greater than in oil, the acoustic wave, which\nmost of its way travels in tank wall (structure-borne path), arrives at the sensor first.\nAfterwards the sensor registers the wave, which propagated in oil slowly (direct acoustic\npath).\n• inaccurate measurement of coordinates of the AE sensors as a result of complex transformer\ntank structure.\nTime-of-arrival of partial discharge pulses is usually estimated by an experienced expert. It is\nalso possible to apply an algorithm dedicated for automatic time-of-arrival estimation (so-\ncalled auto-picker). Currently used algorithms giving satisfying results base on the following\ncriteria: (i) Signal Energy (EC), (ii) Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), (iii) Discrete Wavelet\nDecomposition (DWT), (iv) Gabor centroid, (v) Maximum Likelihood (ML), (vi) Phase in\nfrequency domain and (vii) trigger level.\nFigure 5. Schematic diagram of Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) technique for partial discharge location in power\ntransformer\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications100\nIn most cases, when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high, the auto-pickers allow to estimate time-\nof-arrival with satisfying accuracy. In the rest of cases, it is necessary to apply additional\nadvanced signal denoising methods, which increase the SNR.\nThe figure 6 presents the example of the time-of-arrival estimation of partial discharge pulse\nbased on AIC and energy criterion.\nFigure 6. Exemplary estimation of the time-of-arrival of partial discharge pulse based on AIC and energy criterion\nThe application of triggering with an electrical (IEC-60270 detector, only in laboratory\nconditions) or an electromagnetic (RFCT or UHF sensors, both in laboratory and on-site\nconditions) partial discharge signal is another variant of defects location technique ( Fig. 7).\nThe main advantages of simultaneous use of electrical/electromagnetic triggering and acoustic\nemission method are: (i) obtaining information on time of partial discharge initiation and (ii)\nreduction in the number of AE sensors required for measurement procedure (three are\nsufficient). In order to locate PD-source the following system of equations should be solved:\n (x - xs1)2 + (y - ys1)2 + (z - zs1)2 =(νoil ∙t1)2 (7)\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n101\n(x - xs1)2 + (y - ys1)2 + (z - zs1)2 =(νoil ∙t2)2 (8)\n(x - xs1)2 + (y - ys1)2 + (z - zs1)2 =(νoil ∙t3)2 (9)\nwhere: x, y, z – unknown PD-source coordinates in space, xS1..3, yS1...3, zS1…3 - Cartesian coordi‐\nnates of the sensors S1...S3, t 1, t2, t3 – measured absolute arrival times, voil – acoustic wave\npropagation velocity in transformer oil.\nFigure 7. Schematic diagram of Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) technique with electrical/electromagnetic trigger‐\ning for partial discharge location in power transformer\n5. Examples of partial discharge location and on-line monitoring\n5.1. Case study 1 — Short-term monitoring (daily) of the 160 MVA transformer\nInvestigations were carried out in a power transformer 125000/220 manufactured in 1978 with\nthe parameters shown in Table 1.\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications102\nParameter Value\nType RTdxP 125000/220\nVoltage 230/120/10.5 kV\nPower 160/160/50 MVA\nTable 1. Main parameters of investigated transformer\nThe main reason for performing the partial discharge investigation was a disturbing level of\nflammable gases in the insulating oil, especially hydrogen. It was noticed just after a flashover\nwhich occurred in 2002 in a distribution line that caused a flow of the short-circuit current in\nthe local power system. In successive years the periodic diagnostic measurements revealed a\ncontinuous increase of the amount of gases dissolved in the oil. In 2008 a sudden increase of\ngases in the oil was noticed. The amount of hydrogen exceeded the level of 2000 ppm, and the\nbreakdown voltage of oil decreased to 18 kV, while the permissible value is not less than 50\nkV for this type of transformer.\nUnfortunately, even after oil treatment process, continuous increase of flammable gases in oil\ncontent was still observed. In 2009 SFRA (Sweep Frequency Response Analysis) investigation\nwas made, and the results suggested that the axial displacement, as well as the radial buckling\nof low voltage and compensating winding was probable. In April 2011 the concentration of\nhydrogen exceeded 2200 ppm (with permissible value of 350 ppm), and content of CO 2\nexceeded 3100 ppm, approaching the permissible value equal to 4000 ppm.\nIn order to estimate the danger of a transformer failure, the owner decided to make additional\nmeasurements of PD using the electrical method. For that reason, the 220/110 kV transmission\noverhead lines connected to this transformer had to be temporarily switched off. It should be\nnoted that due to very intensive interference originating mainly from the corona on the\ntransmission lines, it was not possible to detect the PD with the use of the conventional\nelectrical method according to IEC 60270. However in this case, the substation was equipped\nwith one transformer only, so when the transformer and the transmission lines were de-\nenergized for the PD measurement system calibration, the interference did not exceed the level\nof 300 pC. Next, during the PD measurement procedure, when the transformer and the lines\nwere switched on, the interference level changed from 400 pC (110 kV side) to maximum 8 nC\n(220 kV side), depending on investigated phase and transformer load. Measurements with the\nelectrical method were done for all phases of the transformer (on 110 kV and 220 kV side) using\nthe measuring taps of the bushings.\nThe measurement procedure was repeated for each transformer phase and consisted of:\n1. Disconnection of transmission line and switching the transformer off,\n2. Connection of the measuring impedance to the measuring tap of a bushing,\n3. Calibration of the measuring system with the use of a standard PD calibrator,\n4. Energization of the transformer and detection of the partial discharges.\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n103\nTransformer phase Apparent charge [nC]\nHV 1 10\nHV 2 17\nHV 3 11\nLV 1 N/A*\nLV 2 1\nLV 3 N/A*\n* No PD activities or PD buried in background noise\nTable 2. Maximum value of PD apparent charge registered during test\nThe  result  of  the  PD  measurements  carried  out  with  conventional  electrical  method\nrevealed the presence of strong discharges in phase HV 2  (Table 2). The maximum value\nof apparent charge reached 17 nC (Fig. 8), however the range of a phase angle, in which\nthe discharges appeared, was mainly from 30° to 90°. In other phases of 220 kV side ( HV\n1 and HV 3 ) the PD pulses were also recorded, but their apparent charge value did not\nexceed 10-11 nC. The range of phase angle was identical as in HV 2  phase. On the basis\nof the obtained results it was concluded that the signals observed in phases HV 1  and HV\n3 were the same as those coming from the HV 2, but attenuated, indicating their origin as\nHV 2 . In the case of 110 kV side, only the low-energy signals were registered with the\napparent charge up to 1 nC, and in LV 2  phase only.\nFigure 8. The results of PD apparent charge measurement in phase HV 2 of investigated transformer.\nOn the basis of the results obtained with the use of conventional electrical method, it was\ndecided that the procedure of PD source location should be restricted to HV 2 phase only.\nThe time of investigation was not limited, as well as it was possible to carry out the continuous\nmonitoring of the apparent charge level. It was also possible to perform the PD location using\nboth the AAT and the TDOA triangulation.\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications104\nIn case of the AAT, in the first step, the measurement points on the surface of transformer tank\nwere chosen and marked. These points formed a measurement grid. In order to increase the\nreliability of measurements, and simplify the interpretation of the obtained results, the\nfragments of tank walls with higher thickness were omitted (e.g. corrugated walls and welds).\nThe measurement grid consisted of 36 points, as it is shown in figure 9a.\nPower<$%&?>Transformer<$%&?>Diagnostics<$%&?>Based<$%&?>on<$%&?>Acoustic<$%&?\n>Emission<$%&?>Method \nWojciech<$%&?>Sikorski<$%&?>and<$%&?>Krzysztof<$%&?>Walczak \nPoznan<$%&?>University<$%&?>of<$%&?>Technology \nPoland \n \n \n  \n(a) (b) \n \n1.<$%&?>Introduction \nPartial<$%&?>discharge<$%&?>(PD)<$%&?>diagnostics<$%&?>is<$%&?>a<$%&?>proven<$%&?>method<$%&?>to<$%&?>assess<\n$%&?>the<$%&?>condition<$%&?>of<$%&?>a<$%&?>power<$%&?>transformer.<$%&?>Too<$%&?>high<$%&?>level<$%&?>of<\n$%&?>PD<$%&?>in<$%&?>a<$%&?>transformer<$%&?>may<$%&?>quickly<$%&?>degrade<$%&?>its<$%&?>insulation<$%&?>s\nystem<$%&?>and<$%&?>lead<$%&?>to<$%&?>damage.<$%&?>If<$%&?>PDs<$%&?>are<$%&?>detected<$%&?>and<$%&?>locat\ned<$%&?>quickly,<$%&?>then<$%&?>the<$%&?>transformer<$%&?>may<$%&?>be<$%&?>repaired<$%&?>or<$%&?>replaced,<$\n%&?>thus<$%&?>preventing<$%&?>power<$%&?>outages<$%&?>(Bartnikas,<$%&?>2002;<$%&?>Gulski<$%&?>&<$%&?>Smitt,<\n$%&?>2007).<$%&?> \nPartial<$%&?>discharges<$%&?>in<$%&?>power<$%&?>transformers<$%&?>in<$%&?>service<$%&?>are<$%&?>most<$%&?>oft\nen<$%&?>detected<$%&?>with<$%&?>DGA<$%&?>(Dissolved<$%&?>Gas<$%&?>Analysis)<$%&?>and<$%&?>afterwards<$%&?\n>located<$%&?>using<$%&?>acoustic<$%&?>emission<$%&?>method<$%&?>(AE)<$%&?>(Duval,<$%&?>2008;<$%&?>Lundgaar\nd,<$%&?>1992;<$%&?>Bengtsson<$%&?>&<$%&?>Jönsson,<$%&?>1997). \nIn<$%&?>regard<$%&?>to<$%&?>the<$%&?>possibility<$%&?>of<$%&?>location<$%&?>of<$%&?>defects<$%&?>generating<$%\n&?>partial<$%&?>discharges,<$%&?>acoustic<$%&?>emission<$%&?>is<$%&?>an<$%&?>important<$%&?>diagnostic<$%&?>met\nhod<$%&?>of<$%&?>power<$%&?>transformers<$%&?>and<$%&?>other<$%&?>HV<$%&?>equipment.<$%&?><$%&?> \nWidely<$%&?>applied<$%&?>techniques<$%&?>for<$%&?>the<$%&?>fault<$%&?>location<$%&?>based<$%&?>on<$%&?>AE<$\n%&?>method<$%&?>are:<$%&?>(i)<$%&?>measurement<$%&?>of<$%&?>the<$%&?>time<$%&?>difference<$%&?>of<$%&?>arri\nval<$%&?>(TDOA)<$%&?>of<$%&?>the<$%&?>acoustic<$%&?>signals,<$%&?>(ii)<$%&?>measurement<$%&?>of<$%&?>the<$%\n&?>acoustic<$%&?>signal<$%&?>amplitude<$%&?>in<$%&?>different<$%&?>areas<$%&?>of<$%&?>a<$%&?>transformer<$%&?\n>tank<$%&?>(standard<$%&?>auscultatory<$%&?>technique,<$%&?>SAT),<$%&?>(iii)<$%&?>advanced<$%&?>auscultatory<$%\n&?>technique<$%&?>(AAT),<$%&?>(iv)<$%&?>estimation<$%&?>of<$%&?>the<$%&?>direction<$%&?>of<$%&?>arrival<$%&?>(\nFigure 9. The measurement grid (36 points) used for PD source location with advanced auscultatory technique (a) and\nthe result of PD source location presented as an Acoustic Emission Map applied in the picture of the HV 2 phase of the\ninvestigated power transformer (b).\nOn the basis of the results obtained with the use of AAT, the Acoustic Emission Map  was\nprepared and superimposed on a photograph of the transformer tank. The analysis of the\nAcoustic Emission Map image showed that in the HV phase 2 two sources of partial discharges\nwere present (Fig. 9b).\nWhen the acoustic emission measurements with the AAT were finished, a procedure of the\nPD sources location was initiated with the use of a triangulation technique. The AE sensors\nwere placed on the tank wall in the locations identified by the Acoustic Emission Map image\nanalysis. Placing the sensors in region of the strongest AE signals was done to increase the\nprecision of XYZ coordinates’ estimation of the PD source location using the triangulation\nmethod.\nThe analysis of the results of PD source location, obtained with the triangulation method\nshowed that both sources of discharges were placed near the symmetry axis of the phase HV\n2 bushing and the transformer tank (Fig. 10a and 10b). On the basis of the investigation results,\na hypothesis was assumed that partial discharges were generated inside the insulation of the\nwinding leads or in the support beam that is close to the transformer tank.\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n105\n \n(a) (b) \nFigure 10. The result of the PD source location obtained with the use of triangulation method presented in the XYZ\ncoordinates system (the XZ plane illustrates the wall of tank from the HV side) (a) and projection of calculated PD co‐\nordinates (XYZ) to the XZ plane (b).\nBased on the obtained results of defect location and the analysis of the external structures of\nthe transformer tank, the places, where acoustic emission sensors of monitoring system should\nbe mounted, were selected (Fig. 9b). Due to the fact that AE sensors were placed close to located\ndefect, on each of the four channels a similar number of acoustic events was recorded ( Fig.\n11). The amplitude of the signal recorded by each sensor was similar as well.\nThe same was also the average amplitude of the signal recorded by each sensor (Fig. 12) .\nHowever, when looking at the distribution of number of AE events, it can be noted that daily\nactivity profiles of the partial discharges recorded by pairs of sensor (00&01 and 02&03) were\nsimilar. This fact suggests the existence of two defects, which was already mentioned after the\nanalysis of the location results with the use of Advanced Auscultatory Technique (see Fig. 9b).\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications106\nFigure 11. The number of AE events registered during daily monitoring of 160 MVA transformer\nFigure 12. Amplitude of AE events registered during the daily monitoring of 160 MVA transformer.\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n107\nFurther interesting conclusions arise when comparing both the number of events and the\naverage amplitude of the acoustic signal with daily load of the unit (Fig. 13). One can observe\nthat the increase in the load is associated with increase of intensity and amplitude of partial\ndischarges. Load peaks, occurring at 21:00 and 12:00, are accompanied by the largest PD\nintensity and highest average amplitude of registered acoustic signals. Probably, the temper‐\nature increased closed to defect, which was a consequence of the growth in the value of the\ncurrent, causing intensification of the partial discharge phenomenon. Analysis of the impact\nof voltage changes caused by tap changes of the autotransformer, did not show any significant\ncorrelation with respect to the recorded acoustic signal (voltage change were small indeed).\nFigure 13. The value of daily load of the monitored transformer, registered in SYNDIS ES system\nObservation of daily profile of PD activity changes also shows the advantages of on-line\nmonitoring and imperfections of the standard approach to measuring partial discharges.\nAs one can observe in Fig. 11-12, the time of measurement can determine the quality of the\nanalysis. During the day, both periods occurred in the monitored unit: extinction of partial\ndischarges and their particular intensification.\nTherefore one can conclude, that the choice of date and time for the implementation of periodic\ndiagnostic tests by AE method (lasting usually no longer than a few hours) may have a\nfundamental importance for correct and reliable assessment of transformer insulation system.\nOf course, due to the stochastic nature of the partial discharge phenomenon, the most reliable\nresults are obtained by monitoring the unit for a period of time at least one day.\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications108\n5.2. Case study 2 – Short-term monitoring (weekly) of 250 MVA transformer\nA reason for installing the monitoring system to 250 MVA transformer was to observe from\nthe beginning of 2011, the systematic increase of dissolved gases in oil (mostly hydrogen). The\nsame year, in June, the location of the partial discharge sources by means of acoustic emission\nmethod was performed.\nDuring the tests, several areas were located on tank in which recorded acoustic emission pulses\nwere characterized by high amplitude. In the case of the lower voltage side (110 kV), repeatable\npulses with the largest amplitude were recorded close to neutral point bushing (N). In addition,\non the same side, sporadically occurring high amplitude PD pulses localized in phase LV 1\nand LV 3 were recorded. During the measurements, any discharge pulses in phase LV 2 were\nnot registered (Fig. 14). In the case of the high voltage side (400 kV) sporadically occurring\npartial discharge pulses were also recorded, however, they were characterized by much\nsmaller amplitude than it was in the case of the low voltage side.\nFigure 14. Results of PD source location ( Acoustic Emission Map ) obtained using advanced auscultatory technique\n(AAT) on low voltage side of the 250 MVA transformer\nDue to further systematic increase in the level of hydrogen dissolved in oil and the alarming results\nof the detection and location of partial discharges, in December 2011 the transformer owner\ndecided to install a monitoring system for a period of one week. Based on the results of the location,\nobtained before, three AE sensors have been mounted on the tank on the low voltage side near\nselected areas of greatest loudness (phase LV 1 – sensor ’02’, phase LV 3 – sensor ‘00’, proximity to\nneutral point insulator – sensor ‘03’). The last sensor ’01’ was mounted in phase LV 2 (as refer‐\nence sensor), where the test results showed that it is free from partial discharges. Such arrange‐\nment of AE sensors allowed the simultaneous monitoring of all phases of the transformer, with\nparticular emphasis on critical points, which were fixed on the tank before. In the characteristics\nof the number of acoustic events registered during the weekly monitoring of the transformer were\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n109\nsummarized in figure 15. In turn, on figure 16 the values of the oil temperature in top layer and\nvoltages of monitored transformer registered in SYNDIS ES system were presented.\nFigure 15. The number of EA events registered during the weekly monitoring of tested 250 MVA transformer\nFigure 16. The value of the top layer of the oil temperature and voltages of the monitored 250 MVA transformer reg‐\nistered in SYNDIS ES system\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications110\nAnalysis of the characteristics showing the number of AE events recorded by the monitoring\nsystem confirmed the presence of partial discharges in phase LV 1 and LV 3 and the absence\nor presence of a few discharges in phase LV 2 and close to neutral point bushing ( Fig. 15).\nMonitoring showed that pulses with the highest intensity and energy are generated in phase\nC. The recorded PD pulses were unstable, and their ignition took place only in periods of\nvoltage growth (Fig. 16). Moreover, it was noted that the moment of PD ignition correlates\nwith temperature minima of top layer of oil, which may have a relationship with some dynamic\nchanges in moisture at the interface of oil-paper insulation, described for example in (Borsi &\nSchroder, 1994; Buerschaper et al., 2003; Sokolov et al., 1999).\n5.3. Case study 3 ─ Long-term (continuous) monitoring of 330 MVA transformer\nIn this case the choice of the research object, on which continuous monitoring was tested, did\nnot resulted from bad condition of the transformer. The primary purpose was integration of\nthe PD monitoring system with the superior system (SYNDIS ES) and evaluation of opportu‐\nnities for their cooperation. However, as in other cases, place of sensors location were selected\nbasing on previously carried out detection and PD sources location using Advanced Ausculta‐\ntory Technique (Fig. 17).\nFigure 17. Results of PD source location ( Acoustic Emission Maps ) obtained using advanced auscultatory technique\n(AAT) on HV and OLTC side of the 330 MVA transformer\nAcoustic sensors were installed in each HV-phase and on the tank of on-load tap changer\n(OLTC), in the place, where the pulses with the highest amplitude were recorded.\nFor the moment, the system worked continuously and without failure for about 9 months. At\nthat time, it registered several periods of partial discharge activity, but their low intensity not\nsuggested the possibility of a serious threat. However, the ability to correlate, e.g. the moment\nof PD initiation with different parameters recorded by the SYNDIS ES system (oil temperature,\nload, voltage etc.), seems to be interesting, especially from a scientific point of view and the\npossibilities for development and improvement of inference rules implemented in the software\nof monitoring system.\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n111\nFigure 18. The number of AE events registered on 330 MVA transformer, where the long-term test of partial dis‐\ncharge monitoring system was carried out.\nFigure 19. The oil temperature at top layer and values of voltages of the monitored 330 MVA transformer registered\nin SYNDIS ES system\nAcoustic Emission - Research and Applications112\nFor example, figure 18 shows the number of PD pulses registered by two sensors with numbers\n‘01’ and ‘02’, installed respectively in phase HV 1  and HV 2 . As one can observe, partial\ndischarges were transient, but comparison with other parameters, such as temperature and\nvoltage (Fig. 19), allows to detect a correlation. As it was described in the previous case, the\nmoment of PD initiation and growth of its intensity were connected not only with an increase\nin voltage, but at the same time, with relatively low value of oil temperature (20-30°C).\nParticularly high partial discharge activity has been reported in cases, in which the period of\noil cooling and at the same time the growth of voltage lasted at least several hours. In the phase\nHV 1 (sensor ‘01’) this situation took place from 25 until 27 February, and in phase HV 2 (sensor\n‘02’) between 12 and 13 day of the same month.\n6. Conclusions\nThe chapter presents detailed description and features of the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)\ntechnique and new Advanced Auscultatory Technique  (AAT) for location of partial discharge\nsources, as well as some examples of its practical application in power transformer diagnostics.\nThe developed by the authors Advanced Auscultatory Technique  constitutes a synergistic\ncombination of two diagnostic methods: (i) the acoustic emission (AE) and (ii) the conventional\nelectrical PD detection method according to IEC 60270.\nThe presented research results proved numerous advantages of the AAT, among which the\nmost important are:\n• reduction of influence of partial discharge energy fluctuations on energy of registered AE\npulses, which are the main reason of the PD source location errors with the standard\nauscultatory technique,\n• clear and readable presentation of the fault location results in form of a high-resolution\nintensity graph (Acoustic Emission Map),\n• the possibility of correlation between AE parameters and apparent charge,\n• uncomplicated and quick PD location technique, particularly useful for transformer\nmanufacturing plants and repair companies equipped with electrically shielded HV\nlaboratory.\nThe partial discharge online monitoring in power transformer based on AE method was\nanother important topic covered in the chapter.\nThe presented results largely confirmed the advantages offered by the partial discharge\nmonitoring using the acoustic emission method, of which the most important are:\n• ability to assess the profile of daily, weekly or monthly partial discharge activity,\n• possibility of linking the partial discharge activity with other events or parameters recorded\nby the service station or other systems monitoring transformer work,\nPower Transformer Diagnostics Based on Acoustic Emission Method\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/55211\n113\n• ability to assess the dynamics of defect development,\n• elimination of the interpretative errors which might arise in the standard and short-lived\nmeasurement procedures, and\n• possibility of partial discharge sources location.\nAuthor details\nWojciech Sikorski and Krzysztof Walczak\nPoznan University of Technology, Poland\nReferences\n[1] Barnikas, R.
