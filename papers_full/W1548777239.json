    "abstract": "Precise absolute measurement of the errors in a potential transformer (PT) can be achieved using high voltage capacitance bridge (HVCB) and capacitive divider. The uncertainty in a PT measurement using the HVCB system was evaluated by considering the overall factors affecting during the calibration of a PT. The expanded uncertainties are found to be not more than <TEX>$30{\\times}10^{-6}$</TEX> for ratio and <TEX>$30{\\mu}rad$</TEX> for phase up to the primary voltage of <TEX>$V_p=22kV$</TEX>. For same PTs, the measured errors in KRISS (Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science) using our bridge are well coincide with those in NMIA (National Measurement Institute of Australia) and PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) within the corresponding uncertainties.",
