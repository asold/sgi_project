While this development is ex-\nciting, LMs still suffer from some problems (Li\net al., 2022): 1) performance and model parame-\nter size follow a power law relationship (Kaplan\n*Corresponding Author\n1https://github.com/TrustedLLM/RegaVAE\nModel Future Info. in Aggreg-\nationQuery Key Value\nKNN-LM /enc-37 /enc-37 /enc-34Explicit\nRAG /enc-37 /enc-37 /enc-37Explicit\nREALM /enc-37 /enc-37 /enc-37Explicit\nSPALM /enc-37 /enc-37 /enc-34Explicit\nFiD /enc-37 /enc-37 /enc-37Implicit\nEMDR2 /enc-37 /enc-37 /enc-37Implicit\nEPR /enc-37 /enc-37 /enc-37Explicit\nRe2G /enc-37 /enc-37 /enc-37Implicit\nRETRO /enc-37 /enc-37 /enc-34Implicit\nRegaV AE /enc-34 /enc-34 /enc-34Implicit\nTable 1: Differences between RegaV AE and existing\nrepresentative models. Query, Key and Value respec-\ntively indicate whether future information is contained\nin query, key and value parts. Aggregation represents\nthe aggregation method of retrieved documents and\nsource text.\net al., 2020), which results in model parameters\nhaving to grow exponentially in order to gain more\nworld knowledge; 2) difficulty in adjusting for time-\nsensitive knowledge (Lewis et al., 2020); 3) may\nproduce \"fact hallucination\" problem (Guu et al.,\n2020; Marcus, 2020).\nRecently, the advent of retrieval-augmented text\ngeneration has emerged as a novel paradigm aimed\nat addressing these pertinent issues (Borgeaud et al.,\n2022; Li et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023). Compared\nto generative-only models, this paradigm not only\nexplicitly exploits similar texts to generate more\nfluent sentences but also leverages expertise to gen-\nerate difficult responses. Nonetheless, we contend\nthat there are two primary challenges associated\nwith current retrieval-augmented language models.\nFirstly, not only current semantic information, but\nalso future semantic information need to be consid-\nered during retrieval. Previous studies (Khandelwal\net al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020)\n2500\neither directly use the entire text as key and value\nparts at the same time, and then use cosine similar-\nity (Xu et al., 2023), TF-IDF and other indicators to\nsearch, which leads to the value part is only similar\nto the source text (query), and does not necessarily\nserve the best for generator. Another way is to di-\nvide a piece of text into two parts, where the first\npart and the second part are regarded as current in-\nformation and future information, such as RETRO\n(Borgeaud et al., 2022). However, RETRO adds\nfuture information to value part, but ignores the\nfuture information in query and key, which leads to\nthe fact that candidate documents with high simi-\nlarity do not necessarily contain future information\nthat can help the generator. Secondly, explicitly\naggregating retrieved documents and source texts\nis limited by the length of the model input and\nintroduces too much noise. Implicit aggregation\nis inefficient in irregular embedding spaces, and\nretrieval vectors are not generalizable.\nTo address the above challenges, we design Re-\ngaV AE, a Retrieval-augmented language model\nbased on gaussian mixture Variational Auto-\nEncoder. Unlike previous methods that directly\nencode unlabeled corpora (Karpukhin et al., 2020;\nLewis et al., 2020) or only adding future informa-\ntion to the value part (Borgeaud et al., 2022), as\nshown in Tab. 1, our model considers future in-\nformation through a latent space, given an x, we\ndecode it into a y using a conditional V AE, which\nensures that the latent variables contain information\nfrom both source and target data. In addition, in or-\nder to implicitly aggregate the retrieved documents\nand source texts, we also use the probabilistic form\nof the retrieval generation paradigm to theoretically\nextend the prior Gaussian distribution to a Gaussian\nmixture distribution. This allows the latent space\nto satisfy continuity and uniformity, and the latent\nvector after aggregating retrieved documents and\nsource text has better representation ability. Tab. 1\nsummarizes the differences between RegaV AE and\nexisting representative methods. Overall, our con-\ntributions are as follows:\n• We propose a retrieval method that implic-\nitly combines current and future information,\nwhich introduces future information into the\nquery, key, and value parts at the same time,\nso that the higher the document similarity, the\nmore helpful it is for the generator.\n• We integrate the V AE and retrieval generation\nprobabilistic framework to efficiently aggre-\ngate retrieval information into the generation\nprocess. Furthermore, we derive an upper\nbound on the optimization of this framework.\n• Experiments have shown that RegaV AE is\ncompetitive in generating quality, generating\ndiversity, and eliminating hallucinations.\n2 Related Work\nWe classify related studies into two categories, ex-\nplicit aggregation and implicit aggregation, accord-\ning to the way the retrieved documents and source\ntext are aggregated. Explicit aggregation refers\nto concatenating retrieved documents directly into\nsource text to construct augmented input. Implicit\naggregation refers to adding retrieved documents to\nthe generator in the form of vectors or distributions.\nExplicit Aggregation Guu et al. (2020) proposed\nan end-to-end framework REALM that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on three open-domain\nQA. A representative work is RAG (Lewis et al.,\n2020), which first uses DPR (Karpukhin et al.,\n2020) to retrieve relevant documents, and then\nlinks relevant documents with the source text for\nsequence-to-sequence generation. Different from\nRAG and REALM, Rubin et al. (2022) proposed\nEPR, which is a method for retrieving prompts and\ncan improve the effect of prompts. Re2G (Glass\net al., 2022) is an enhanced version of RAG, which\nimproves the quality of retrieved documents by\nintegrating multiple retrieval methods. Explicit ag-\ngregation is simple and effective, but it suffers from\nthe limitation of the input length of the language\nmodel and cannot fully utilize the large number\nof retrieved documents. In addition, it is easy to\nintroduce noise, making the model performance un-\nstable. Unlike these methods, our model implicitly\naggregates retrieved documents into the generation\nprocess.\nImplicit Aggregation FiD (Izacard and Grave,\n2021) uses a DPR to retrieve candidate documents,\nand then splices and encodes the candidate docu-\nments with the source text, and inputs them into the\ngenerator in the form of vectors. EMDR2 (Sachan\net al., 2021) is similar to FiD, and it provides an\nend-to-end framework to train both the retriever\nand the generator. However, the query, key and\nvalue parts of FiD and EMDR2 do not contain fu-\nture information, which will cause the value part to\nbe similar to the query part and not conducive to\nthe generation of future tokens.

Based on the training data, we first train a V AE to construct a compact latent\nspace, which ensures that the latent variable zcontains both current and future information (see § 3.1). We then\nbuild a retrieval database and then aggregate the retrieved information into the generator (see § 3.2). V AE Encoder\nand Decoder parameters are the same in all steps. In order to ensure fairness, the Corpus data and the Source data in\nthe training set are the same. Grepresents the Gaussian mixture distribution, and πis the corresponding parameter.\net al., 2022) and KNN-LM (Khandelwal et al.,\n2020) set key and value parts as a piece of text,\nand added the continuation and the next token of\nthis text in value part, respectively. However, they\nonly calculate the similarity between the query and\nkey while ignoring future information in value part,\nresulting in high similarity documents containing\nfuture information that may not necessarily help\nthe generator. Our model sets both key and value\nparts as latent variables of a piece of text and its\nfuture continuation, and the query encoded by the\nV AE encoder also contains future information, so\nfuture information is also taken into account when\ncalculating the similarity between query and key,\nmaking up for the shortcomings of previous stud-\nies.\n3 Methodology\nMost text generation tasks can be formulated as\na mapping from a source text x to a target text\ny: y= f(x), while retrieval-augmented text gen-\neration can be further formulated as: y= f(x,r),\nwhere ris the relevant document retrieved based\non x. Specifically, this approach generally encom-\npasses the utilization of a retriever denoted as R\nand a generator denoted as G. The retriever Rob-\ntains rfrom the retrieval source Sby the retrieval\nmetric D and x. Then r and xare fed into Gto\nobtain ythrough a predefined integration method I.\nCommonly used retrieval indexesDinclude cosine\nsimilarity, TF-IDF, etc. This paradigm can also be\nexpressed in probabilistic form:\np(y|x) =\n∑\nr∈top-k(p(·|x))\np(y|x,r)p(r|x). (1)\nNext, the framework of RegaV AE is introduced,\nwhich consists of three steps. Firstly, in order to\nconstruct a compact space, we introduce the V AE\nstructure. Since transformers based on V AE all\nsuffer from the posterior collapse (Fu et al., 2019),\nwe follow a previous study (Hu et al., 2022) which\ncombines low-rank tensor products for latent vari-\nables and decoders (see § 3.1 and step 1 in Fig. 1).\nSecondly, to introduce retrieval information into\nthe latent space, we first introduce how the retrieval\nlibrary is constructed (see step 2 in Fig. 1), and\nthen replace the prior Gaussian distribution in the\noriginal V AE with a Gaussian mixture distribution\nto derive RegaV AE (see step 3 in Fig. 1). This\nallows for deep aggregation of retrieved and input\ndocuments and simultaneously incorporates future\ninformation into query, key and value parts, which\nhelps to generate more fluent sentences (see § 3.2)\n. Finally, to train RegaV AE, we derive an optimiz-\nable upper bound on the loss function for unclosed\nsolutions (see § 3.3). Fig. 1 shows the whole frame-\nwork diagram.\n2502\n3.1 Introduce Retrieval Information into\nLatent Space\nWe consider using the V AE structure to make the\nspace compact and continuous. As a kind of gen-\nerative model, V AE estimates the intractable data\ndistribution p(x) by deriving and maximizing its\nEvidence Lower BOund (ELBO) as:\nlog p(x) ≥LELBO =\nEqϕ(z|x)[log pθ(x|z)] −KL(qϕ(z|x)||p(z)), (2)\nwhere z is the latent variable. p(z) and p(z|x) is\nthe prior and posterior distribution of z, respec-\ntively. qϕ(z|x) and pθ(x|z) represent Encoder and\nDecoder. θand ϕare corresponding parameters.\nDue to the power of the decoder, transformers\nbased on V AE usually have the problem of posterior\ncollapse. According to Hu et al. (2022), we use\na low-rank tensor product in the l-th layer of the\nmodel:\n˜v(l)\ni = (\nr∑\nj=1\nW(l,j)\nv v(l)\ni ) ◦(\nr∑\nj=1\nW(l,j)\nz zl), (3)\nwhere zl and v(l) represent latent variable and hid-\nden variable of l-th layer respectively. v(l)\ni repre-\nsents the hidden vector of thei-th token inl-th layer.\nris a hyper-parameter, and ◦means element-wise\nmultiplication. Wv and Wz are learnable param-\neters which are shared across all positions (i) but\nnot shared with l-th layer.\nIn order not to introduce additional data, we use\nthe training set as the data for training V AE. By\noptimizing ELBO, each sample is encoded into the\nlatent space and then restored by the decoder to\nobtain a compact latent space.\n3.2 Build the RegaV AE Model\nBuild Retrieval Database With a compact latent\nspace, we use an encoder to encode xand rfrom\nSinto the latent space. The latent variables of x\nand rare denoted by zx and zr, respectively. Then\nwe store zr as key and value parts in the retrieval\ndatabase. Given a query zx, we compute the inner\nproduct of it and zr to obtain the similarity.\nD(zx,zr\ni) = cos(zx,zr\ni), (4)\nwhere zr\ni ∼N(µi,σ2\ni) represents the latent vector\nof the i-th retrieved sample in S. µi and σ2\ni are\nthe corresponding mean and standard deviation,\nrespectively. Since our framework is trained end-\nto-end, the parameters of the encoder change with\neach training step, resulting in changes in the latent\nspace. Considering that it is impractical to update\nthe retrieval database in real-time, and previous\nwork (Guu et al., 2020) has shown the practicality\nof updating the index intermittently during training,\nwe follow this approach and update the index of\nretrieval database every fixed number of training\nsteps.\nAggregate Retrieved Information Inspired by\nthe retrieval-generated text generation paradigm,\nwe assume y is influenced by latent variables zx\nand zr. To obtain the ELBO of RegaV AE, we first\nmodel log p(y) as:\nlog p(y) = log\n∫∫\np(y,zr,zx)dzrdzx\n≥\n∫∫\nlog p(y,zr,zx)dzrdzx\n=\n∫∫\nlog q(zr,zx|x)log p(y,zr,zx)\nlog q(zr,zx|x) dzrdzx\n= Eq(zr,zx|x) log[p(y,zr,zx)\nq(zr,zx|x) ].\n(5)\nFrom the first step, the Jensen inequality can\nbe used to transform to the second step, and then\nthe expression of the desired form can be obtained.\nAccording to Bayes formula:\np(y,zr,zx) =p(y|zr,zx)p(zr,zx). (6)\nSubstituting Eq. 6 into Eq. 5:\nEq(zr,zx|x) log[p(y,zr,zx)\nq(zr,zx|x) ]\n= Eq(zr,zx|x) log[p(y|zr,zx)p(zr,zx)\nq(zr,zx|x) ]\n= Eq(zr,zx|y)[log p(y|zr,zx)]\n−KL(q(zr,zx|x)||p(zr,zx)),\n(7)\nwhere KL stands for calculating the KL divergence\nbetween two distributions. Eq. 7 is the ELBO of\nRegaV AE. At this point, Eq. 7 and Eq. 2 have the\nsame form, but the latent variable z is replaced\nby zx and zr. Since each zr\ni follows a Gaussian\ndistribution, we consider using a Gaussian mixture\ndistribution to combine zx and zr. So q(zr,zx|x)\ncan be expressed as:\nq(zr,zx|x) =w0q(zx|x) +\nn∑\ni=1\nwiq(zr\ni|x), (8)\nwhere nrepresents the number of retrieved docu-\nments.\nwi = softmax(D(zx,zr\ni)), (9)\n2503\nwhere ∑n\ni=0 wi = 1makes q(zr,zx|x) satisfy the\nrequirement of Gaussian mixture distribution. So\nfar, we have obtained the theoretical framework for\nintroducing retrieval information in latent space.\n3.3 Training RegaV AE\nWe can optimize RegaV AE by optimizing Eq. 7. In\nthe KL divergence term of Eq. 7, the closed-form\nsolution cannot be obtained because the two distri-\nbutions are mixed Gaussian distributions. There-\nfore, we continue to use previous research (Dilok-\nthanakul et al., 2016), that is, to optimize its upper\nbound. First we assume two Gaussian mixture dis-\ntributions as:\np=\n∑ n\ni=1\nπigi, ˆp=\n∑ n\ni=1\nˆπiˆg. (10)\nThe KL divergence between them can be ex-\npressed as:\nKL(p||ˆp) =\n∫\n(\n∑\ni\nπigi) log\n∑\niπigi∑\ni ˆπiˆgi\n≤\n∫ ∑\ni\nπigilog πigi\nˆπiˆgi\n=\n∑\ni\nπilog πi\nˆπi\n+\n∑\ni\nπi\n∫\ngilog gi\nˆgi\n= KL(π||ˆπ) +\n∑\ni\nπiKL(gi||ˆgi).\n(11)\nIn the variational distribution q(zr,zx|x), the\ntrainable parameter is only wi and q(zx|x). And\nthe prior distribution p(zr,zx) is defined as:\np(zr,zx) = ˆw0p(zx) +\n∑ n\ni=1\nˆwip(zr\ni), (12)\nwhere zx ∼N(0,1) and zr\ni ∼N(0,1). So the\nupper bound for the KL term in Eq. 7 can become:\nKL(q(zr,zx|x)||p(zr,zx)) ≤\n∑ n\ni=0\nKL(wi||ˆwi)\n+ KL(q(zx|x)||N(0,I)) + C,\n(13)\nwhere C is a constant that has nothing to do with\nmodel parameter updates. We do not update the\nretrieval library in real time, but regularly update it\naccording to the number of training steps. In this\nsetup, wi is constant, so Eq. 13 becomes:\nKL(q(zr,zx|x)||p(zr,zx))\n≤KL(q(zx|x)||N(0,1)) + C. (14)\nSubstituting Eq 14 into Eq 7, we can get the final\noptimized loss function:\nL= Eq(zr,zx|y)[log p(y|zr,zx)]\n−KL(q(zx|x)||N(0,1)).\n(15)\nEq. 15 can be regarded as an optimizable upper\nbound of Eq. 8. When given a dataset, we first en-\ncode the source text to obtain a retrieval database.\nThe top-k documents are then retrieved for each x\nseparately. Then the corresponding latent variables\nzx and zr are aggregated in the form of Gaussian\nmixture distribution and then input into Gto ob-\ntain the output. Finally, we use Eq. 15 to train\nRegaV AE.\n4 Experiment\nThis section provides the experimental datasets,\nexperimental settings, and experimental results.\n4.1 Datasets\nFor experiments, we employ three datasets, namely\nYelp (Yang et al., 2017), Yahoo (He et al., 2019)\nand WritingPrompts (WP) (Fan et al., 2018). As\nin previous studies (Hu et al., 2022), due to the\nlimitation of computing resources, we adopt the\nmethodology established in previous research and\nsample 100,000 data instances from the training\nset of Yelp and Yahoo for model training. This\nconsistent approach ensures a fair and equitable\nbasis for comparison across the evaluated models.\n4.2 Metrics\nGeneration Quality In the context of the text\ngeneration task, we present the evaluation metrics\nof perplexity (PPL), Self-BLEU (Zhu et al., 2018),\nDist2 (Li et al., 2016), and Activation Units (AU)\n(Burda et al., 2016). For the WritingPrompts, in ad-\ndition to PPL, we also report the metrics of BLEU\n(Papineni et al., 2002), Rouge-1, Rouge-2, Rouge-\nL (Mithun et al., 2012), and BERTScore (Zhang\net al., 2020).\nHallucination We use SelfCheckGPT (Manakul\net al., 2023) to detect hallucinations produced by\nthe model. There are four indicators in total,\nnamely SBERT, SQA, Sa\nn and Sm\nn . The higher their\nvalue, the more likely the model is hallucinating.\n4.3 Experiment Settings\nWe have chosen two distinct categories of models\nas our baselines.

For transformers based on V AE, results of Optimus are directly copied\nfrom the original paper with λ = 0.5. The activation threshold of AU is 0.2. For retrieval-augmented language\nmodels, RETRO, FiD and RAG are reproduced by ourselves under the same parameter size. KNN-LM employs the\ntraining set data as the retrieval corpus. In addition, to ensure fairness, all retrieval sources are training sets. The\nCost column provides an indication of the temporal investment(h) required for training the respective model on an\nA40-48G GPU.\nTransformers based on V AEFor a comprehen-\nsive comparison, we choose Optimus (Li et al.,\n2020) and ADA V AE (Tu et al., 2022) as the base-\nline models, along with four distinct paradigms:\nEmbed (Li et al., 2020), Memory (Fang et al.,\n2021), Softmax (Wang and Wan, 2019) and\nDELLA (Hu et al., 2022). Optimus is a large-scale\nmodel based on V AE that utilizes a pre-trained\nBERT model as its encoder and a pre-trained GPT-\n2 model as its decoder. In order to ensure the fair-\nness of the evaluation, RegaV AE uses the same\npre-trained language model as Embed, Memory,\nSoftmax and DELLA. This selection facilitates a\nrigorous and unbiased comparative analysis across\nthese models.\nRetrieval-augmented Language Model Ac-\ncording to the division method of related work,\nwe select representative works from different cate-\ngories of retrieval-augmented language models as\nbaselines. Specifically, RAG, FiD, and RETRO rep-\nresent models with explicit aggregation, implicit\naggregation without future information, and im-\nplicit aggregation with only future information in\nvalue part, respectively.\nOur Model Consistent with prior research, we\nadopt the GPT2 model as the underlying backbone\nnetwork for our experimentation. The dimension of\nthe hidden variable is set to 32, and KL annealing\n(Fu et al., 2019) is implemented to mitigate the is-\nsue of KL term disappearance. The learning rate is\nfixed at 5×10−5 to ensure stable training. Our train-\ning procedure entails an initial 10 epoch training\nphase on the original DELLA model to establish\na robust initial V AE space. Subsequently, we con-\nduct approximately fifteen epochs of training on\nthe RegaV AE model until it achieves convergence.\nTo make the training process more efficient, we\nprecomputed document embeddings for the train-\ning dataset and created a FAISS index (Johnson\net al., 2021) for fast similarity searches. We use the\nbert_score library 2 to calculate the BERTScore\nfor our models and baselines.\n4.4 Automatic Evaluation\nText Generation Tab. 2 presents the results at-\ntained by RegaV AE model on text generation\ndatasets. Compared to the three baseline mod-\nels for retrieval augmentation, our model achieves\nsubstantial improvements in all metrics, and per-\nforms particularly well in generating quality met-\nrics. The enhanced PPL, Self-BLEU, and Dist2\nscores demonstrate that latent variables, which con-\ntain both source and target information, combined\n2https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score\n2505\nModel PPL ↓ BLEU↑ R1↑ R2↑ RL↑ BERTScore↑ Self-BLEU↓ Dist2↑\nGPT2 - 27.89 27.72 7.96 14.30 78.12 53.78 22.99\nEmbed - 39.67 36.17 7.96 15.78 81.64 64.55 14.31\nMemory - 40.79 36.13 8.04 16.16 81.68 67.56 12.90\nSoftmax - 41.04 36.14 8.12 16.30 81.75 67.02 13.08\nDELLA 2.16 41.39 35.46 8.78 17.20 81.77 56.28 20.91\nRegaV AE 1.18 43.83 32.21 9.62 30.57 84.31 52.70 23.28\nTable 3: Results for the WritingPrompts.

This empirical validation corrobo-\nrates the theoretical strength of our model.\nNotably, in comparison to the transformer-based\nV AE model, RegaV AE with retrieval demonstrates\nsuperior performance in terms of both generative\ndiversity and quality. This enhancement can be at-\ntributed to the utilization of a Gaussian mixture dis-\ntribution, which offers the ability to capture multi-\nmodal distributions more effectively than a single\nGaussian distribution. Leveraging the source data,\nRegaV AE retrieves auxiliary latent variables that\nfacilitate the generation of the target data, thereby\nyielding improved text generation outcomes. Fur-\nthermore, the significant improvement in the AU\nvalue indicates that the aggregation we employ pos-\nitively contributes to the generative process of de-\ncoder. This alleviates the problem of collapsing at\nthe rear of the model to a considerable extent.\nHallucination Evaluation We evaluate halluci-\nnations of RegaV AE on the Yelp dataset. Specif-\nically, we sample the text generated by the same\nlatent variable three times, and then feed the sam-\npling results into SelfCheckGPT to obtain evalu-\nation scores. The results are shown in the Tab. 4.\nFrom the experimental results, it can be seen that\nthe text generated by RegaV AE is the least halluci-\nnatory compared with other models.\n4.5 Human Evaluation\nIn addition to automated evaluation, we conducted\na human evaluation to assess and compare the per-\nformance of baseline models against our proposed\nmethod. Five professionals with expertise in the\ndomain were enlisted to participate in the manual\nevaluation process. Each evaluator was tasked with\nrating the attributes of fluency (Flu.), coherence\n(Coh.), diversity (Div.), and hallucination (Hal.) on\na scale ranging from 1 to 5. A rating of 1 denoted\nvery low performance, while a rating of 5 indicated\nvery high performance. A total of 50 test samples\nwere randomly selected and evaluated across dif-\nferent models. The final human evaluation result\nwas obtained by averaging the scores provided by\nthe evaluators.\nTab. 5 presents the outcomes of human evalu-\nation conducted on the Yelp dataset. RegaV AE\noutperforms the baseline models in almost all di-\nmensions, demonstrating superior performance in\ncomparison. To further establish the correlation\nbetween human and automated evaluation results,\nwe calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient\nand presented the corresponding values in Tab. 6.\nThe results obtained from human evaluation align\nclosely with those derived from partially automated\nevaluation metrics. For example, the correlation\nbetween the human evaluation metrics (Flu., Coh.)\nassociated with PPL and PPL itself is nearly identi-\ncal.\n2506\n5 10 25 50 100\nNumbel of neighbors\n7.0\n7.5\n8.0\n8.5\n9.0\n9.5PPL\nYelp\nYahoo\nWP\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nFigure 2: Performance of RegaV AE on test sets as a\nfunction of the number of retrieved neighbors.

We\nalso give a case to verify the model performance.\n5.1 Number of Retrieved Neighbors\nFig .2 depicts the performance trends in relation to\nthe number of retrieved neighbors. Notably, as the\nnumber of retrieved neighbors increases from 5 to\n100, we observed a reduction in PPL by 0.64 on\nthe Yelp dataset and 0.69 on the Yahoo dataset, and\nPPL on the WP dataset is reduced by 0.59. This\nupward trend proves that implicit aggregation meth-\nods can effectively filter noise compared to explicit\naggregation methods, and moreover, aggregations\nusing Gaussian mixture distributions are effective\nfor retrieving documents and source texts.\nCorp-value Flu.

In-\nterestingly, we observed that the model augmented\nwith retrieval performed even worse than the model\nwithout retrieval when the V AE structure was ab-\nsent. We speculate that the retrieved variables in\nthis particular scenario reside in a space that fails to\nmeet the requirements of uniformity and continuity.\nAs a result, the model struggled to generate valid\nsamples based on cosine similarity, introducing\nunwanted noise instead.\nCompared with other retrieval methods, it can\nbe seen that the performance of traditional retrieval\nmethods is obviously insufficient. This discrepancy\ncan be attributed to our approach incorporating\nfuture information into key, value, and query parts\nsimultaneously, thus taking future information into\naccount in both retrieval and generation phases,\nfurther validating our motivation.\n2507\n5.3 Case Study\nWe present a compelling example to examine the\nquality of RegaV AE-generated text and explore the\nintegration of retrieval information into the gener-\nated content, as illustrated in Fig. 3.\nThrough our observations, we have noted that\nthe text produced by RegaV AE demonstrates a re-\nmarkable ability to establish a coherent connection\nwith the source text while being vivid and specific.\nMoreover, despite encoding only the retrieved doc-\nument into the latent space and subsequently inte-\ngrating it into the generation process, it is evident\nthat RegaV AE-generated text effectively incorpo-\nrates future information from the retrieved docu-\nment.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we summarize two major challenges\nof existing retrieval-augmented language model\nmethods, and propose RegaV AE to address them.\nWe find that RegaV AE outperforms traditional re-\ntrieval generative models in terms of both gener-\native quality and reduce hallucinations. In addi-\ntion, ablation experiments and three analysis exper-\niments verify the correctness of the model motiva-\ntion. In future work, we will consider migrating\nRegaV AE to large language models.\nLimitations\nAt present, almost all large language models are\npre-trained on large-scale corpus, and due to the\nlimitation of computing resources, we cannot pre-\ntrain RegaV AE on large-scale corpus, which will\nlead to performance degradation.\nFurthermore, the model is not stable to train due\nto the posterior collapse problem. Even if we adopt\na low-rank tensor product, this problem still cannot\nbe completely solved.\nEthics Statement\nWe honor and support the EMNLP code of Ethics.\nThis paper mainly studies the use of retrieval gen-\neration to eliminate the illusion in the language\nmodel and make the generated text more fluent.\nOur method can introduce canonical text to make\nlanguage models more reliable. In addition, the\ndata sets used in this article are all open source and\ndo not involve any privacy or ethical issues.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by the National Key\nR&D Program of China (2022YFB3103700,\n2022YFB3103704), the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (NSFC) under Grants No.\n62276248, and the Youth Innovation Promotion\nAssociation CAS under Grants No. 2023111.\nReferences\nSebastian Borgeaud, Arthur Mensch, Jordan Hoffmann,\nTrevor Cai, Eliza Rutherford, Katie Millican, George\nvan den Driessche, Jean-Baptiste Lespiau, Bogdan\nDamoc, Aidan Clark, Diego de Las Casas, Aurelia\nGuy, Jacob Menick, Roman Ring, Tom Hennigan,\nSaffron Huang, Loren Maggiore, Chris Jones, Albin\nCassirer, Andy Brock, Michela Paganini, Geoffrey\nIrving, Oriol Vinyals, Simon Osindero, Karen Si-\nmonyan, Jack W.
