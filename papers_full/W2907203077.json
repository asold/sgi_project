In this \ninverse assessment problem, soilRfoundation compliance is often not explicitly \nconsidered rigorously during design and/or purely numerical assessment. The \npresent work aims to investigate the correlation between subsoilRfoundation \nstiffness and modal characteristics of bridges, as a means to identify a threshold \nbeyond which rigorous subsoil modelling is a prerequisite for reliable model \nupdating. The 2nd Kavala Ravine bridge, in Greece, serves as the case study for this \npurpose for which a reasonably reliable finite element (FE) model is developed and \nupdated based on ambient vibration measurements. Alternative soil profiles and \nsubsequently redesigned foundation systems are then used to examine the effect \nthat the correspondingly variable soil compliance would have on the natural \nfrequencies of the bridge. It is shown that soil stiffness alone is not an adequate \nproxy to decide on the necessity for subsoil modelling, as the foundation stiffness \n(particularly in cases of softer soil profiles) tends to balance the dynamic properties \nof the holistic soilRfoundation system. The soilRfoundation stiffness is therefore the \nkey parameter that dictates the need for refined modelling of soilRstructure \ninteraction in the framework of SIRbased model updating.   \nKeywords: Bridges; monitoring; soil dynamics; identification; calibration; finite \nelement method. \nIntroduction \nSystem Identification serves as an increasingly useful for assessing the structural health \nof infrastructure systems, which operates supplementary to visual inspection and to other \nnonRdestructive evaluation techniques (Chang, Flatau & Liu, 2003). It aims to provide \ninsight into the current health state of a structure and/or its residual lifetime, commonly \nby detecting alteration in vibration properties (mainly natural frequencies and mode \nshapes) that are indicative of damage. The latter may be identified either via: (i) outputR\nPage 2 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nonly ambient vibrationRbased system identification techniques, where only the structural \nresponse is recorded (Peeters & De Roeck ,1999; Brincker, Zhang & Andersen , 2001; \nGauberghe, 2004), or (ii) inputRoutput methods, where both the response and the \nexcitation are measured (Werner, Beck & Levine, 1987; Chaudhary, Abé, Fujino & \nYoshida, 2000;\n Seo, Hu & Lee, 2016). One approach is to follow the evolution of the \nidentified modal properties during the structure’s operation (Dervilis, Worden & Cross, \n2015; Spiridonakos, Chatzi & Sudret, 2016; Reynders & De Roeck, 2009), to investigate \nwhether observed variations can be attributed to structural stiffness degradation. When \nlongRterm monitoring data is unavailable, which is the most common case, the identified \nmodal properties can be compared with finite element (FE) model predictions. \nAppropriate model updating is then applied, until a correlation is achieved between the \nidentified and numerically calculated modal characteristics (Mottershead & Friswell, \n1993). This procedure may draw important information regarding both the structural \nintegrity and the reliability of the nominal FE numerical model of the ‘asRbuilt’ structure.  \nSeveral studies have demonstrated that apart from damageRrelated stiffness \ndegradation, deviations between the identified and the reference modal properties may be \nalso attributed to soilRstructure interaction (SSI) effects. Luco (1980), identified shifts of \nthe soilRstructure stiffness of the nineRstory reinforced concrete Milikan library in \nCalifornia, during the 1971 San Fernado earthquake (notably, period elongation was \npartially recovered at the end of ground shaking). Todorovska (2009), further studying \nmeasurements from the same building between 1970 and 2002, quantified the amplitudeR\ndependence of the system frequency. This was driven by the fact that during the strongest \nWhittierRNarrows 1987 earthquake, the system frequency decreased by 40%, finally \nrecovering to 15% decrease, compared to the initial state of 1970. In Trifunac, Ivanovic \nand Todorovska (2001b), the amplitude dependence of system frequency of a sevenRstory \nPage 3 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nreinforced concrete hotel in Van Nuys, California was studied based on recordings from \n12 earthquakes. The observed changes were attributed to both the geometric nonlinear \nresponse of the foundationRsoil system (in terms of the idealised depth of foundation \nfixity) and to variation of soil properties due to consolidation induced by low amplitude \naftershocks. The authors highlighted the importance of modelling soilRfoundation systems \nwith sophisticated models as part of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM).  \nSimilarly, Chaudhary et al. (2001, 2008), examined the effect of SSI on the \nmeasured properties of permanently monitored bridges in Japan, highlighting higher \nimpact on weaker soils. In that case, the frequency of the flexible base structure was \nmeasured half to the corresponding fixedRbase, varying as a function of the column to \nfoundation stiffness ratio. An additional 10% to 30% reduction in the shear modulus was \nobserved during earthquake excitation. Lately, in Gomez, Ulusoy and Feng (2013), the \nmodal characteristics of a bridge in California were identified based on six earthquake \nrecords, concluding that larger earthquake intensities may result in reduced natural \nfrequencies, due to softening of the foundation soil. It is noted for completeness, that \nvariability in the environmental conditions such as humidity, traffic loading and wind \nspeed may also lead to additional, indeed small but not negligible (up to 5%) \ndiscrepancies in the identified dynamic characteristics of bridges (Cross, Koo, Brownjohn \n& Worden, 2013; Yuen & Kuok, 2010).   \nEven though the above research has highlighted the importance of soil \ncompliance in the measured properties of both bridges and buildings, only a few studies \nthat utilize system identification data to calibrate finite element models, do account for \nsoil stiffness (see Crouse, Hushmand & Martin, 1987; Huang, Yang, Ku & Chen, 1999; \nChaudhary, 2004; Teughels & De Roeck, 2004; Morassi & Tonon, 2008; Sextos, \nFaraonis, Zabel, Wutke, Arndt & Panetsos, 2016), while others simply adopt the \nPage 4 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nassumption of fixed support conditions (Wu &Li, 2004; Caetano, Cunha, Gattulli & \nLepidi, 2005; Jaishi & Ren, 2005; Macdonald & Daniell, 2005; Zivanovic, Pavic & \nReynolds, 2009). Admittedly, it is not straightforward to assess in advance neither the \nnecessity of detailed modelling (Chaudhary, 2015; Chaudhary, 2017) nor the accuracy of \nthe fixedRbase assumption. This is mainly due to the fact that the dynamic properties of a \nsoilRstructure system are inevitably dependent on the intensity of excitation, which is not \nknown in advance and on the salient subsoil conditions which may considerably vary in \nspace.  \nAlong these lines, the scope of this paper is to study numerically the sensitivity of \ndynamic properties (natural frequencies, modal participating mass ratios and mode \nshapes), of a permanently monitored bridge structure, on alternative assumptions made \nregarding its soilRfoundation stiffness. Having updated a FE model and studied the \ndependency of the soilRstructure system dynamic properties on the compliance of the \nsupporting subsoil, it is further aimed to determine the conditions under which boundary \nconditions need to be tuned in order to match the globally measured quantities. To serve \nthe above purpose, existing modal identification data are employed for a wellRstudied \nbridge structure in Greece (Ntotsios et al., 2008) that has been continuously monitored \nsince 2005. The methodology adopted, the results obtained, and the observations made \nfor different soil conditions and, subsequently, different bridge foundation configurations \nare discussed in the following.  \nMethodology \nIn FE model updating applications an evolutionary (search) algorithm is commonly \nutilized to determine the optimal values of a set of \nn structural parameters \n{ }1 2, ,..., nθ θ θ θ= , of the initially developed numerical model, minimizing a userRdefined \nPage 5 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nobjective function ( )Jθ .

The heuristic nature of the algorithm allows tackling of nonR\nconventional optimization problems (nonRlinear nonRconvex blackRbox optimisation) and \ncan be applied both to unconstrained and bounded constraint continuous optimization \nproblems. It is a second order approach estimating, within an iterative procedure, a \ncovariance matrix, for convexRquadratic functions closely related to the inverse Hessian. \nThis renders the method applicable to nonRseparable and/or badly conditioned problems. \nIn contrast to quasiRNewton methods, the CMARES neither computes nor uses gradients. \nThus, the method is efficiently applied on problems for which the gradients are not \navailable or are inconvenient to compute.  \nHerein, the CMARES was selected to be used since it offers a convenient, though \ncomputationally more costly alternative, to solve the opitimization problem. Even though \nin our case the\n objective function is smooth and continuous (Figure 1), CMARES can be \nalso efficiently applied on nonRsmooth and even nonRcontinuous problems, as well as on \nmultimodal and/or noisy problems (Hansen & Ostermeier, 2001; Hansen & Kern, 2004). \nA comparative assessment regarding the efficiency of the selected algorithm with respect \nto other available options is presented in a following section. \nIt is noted that as the objective of the postulated parameterization was to calibrate \nthe properties of individual elements such as the modulus of elasticity of the bridge \nbearings, deck and piers to match the identified modal characteristics of the structure,  \nlocal changes or spatially variability of soil stiffness was not considered. This would also \nrequire a much denser array of sensors and hence, it was deemed as falling outside the \nscope of this study. \nDescription of the studied bridge \nThe 2\nnd Kavala bypass Ravine bridge is studied herein, located along the Egnatia \nPage 7 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nMotorway, which is major lifeline crossing the northern Greece from its western to its \neastern border (Figure 2). The construction of the bridge was completed in 2004 and its \ntotal length is approximately 180m. The structural system comprises of two statically \nindependent branches, with four identical simply supported spans of 45m (Ntotsios et al., \n2008). Each span is built with four precast postRtensioned IRbeams of 2.80m height that \nsupport a continuous deck of 26cm thickness and 13m width. The four spans of the deck \nare interconnected through a 2m long and 20cm thick continuity slab over the piers \n(details in Figure 2). The IRbeams are supported by two abutments (A\n1 and A 2) and by \nthree piers (M1, M2 and M3) through laminated elastomeric bearings. Each abutment has 4 \ncircular bearings (Φ650×195mm) and each pier has 8 rectangular bearings \n(600×400×99mm for M1 and M3, 600×300×52mm for M2).  \nThe piers have a 4×4m hollow crossRsection with 40cm wall thickness and heights \nequal to 26.50m (M 1, M3) and 48.90m (M 2).  All piers are supported on 6m diameter \nsolid concrete caissons, of 10m, 9.80m and 12.20m length (M 1, M2, M3, respectively), \nembedded into the subsoil. Based on the geotechnical report of the bridge and 5 \nboreholes at the two abutments and the base of piers M1RM3, the soil was described as \nvolcanic rocks, in particular felsic granite and shale with a Rock Mass Rating RMR of 40 \n(poor), and a Rock Quality Designation index RQD<25% (very poor). Given a uniaxial \ncompressive strength σ c=40MPa, the Young’s modulus of elasticity 0E  is identified \nequal to 3.5GPa based on the following expression (Hoek & Brown, 1997): \n10\n40\n10100\nRMR\ncE σ\n− \n  =      (3) \nThe shear wave velocity 0SV  was computed to be 820m/sec (for Poisson ratio v\n=0.3 and mass density ρ=2 t/m3) also corresponding to rock, according to the Eurocode \n8 soil classification (rock, type A ,30SV > 800m/sec):  \nPage 8 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n 0 00\n2(1 )\nS\nG E vV ρ ρ\n+= =  (4) \nNotably, even though the subsoil of the studied bridge was very stiff, the bridge was not \nfounded on shallow foundation but using large caissons. This was due to the fact that the \nfoundation slope was very steep with a high landslide susceptibility, hence, \nconstructability and accessibility eventually dictated the design.  \nIdentified structural modes via ambient vibrations \nThe structural modes of the southern branch of the 2\nnd Kavala bypass Ravine bridge were \nalready identified via low amplitude (8mg maximum measured acceleration in the \nhorizontal direction and 43mg in the vertical direction) ambient vibrations by Ntotsios et \nal. (2008). More specifically, the bridge was instrumented with 24 uniaxial Kinemetrics \nEpisensor accelerometers (±2 g full scale), as shown in Figure 3. The first letter in the \nsensor labels denotes their orientation (L: longitudinal, T: transverse, V: vertical), while \nthe last their number. From the total of 24 accelerometers, 18 were installed on the deck \n(2 longitudinal, 10 vertical and 6 transverse), and 6 at the top of the three piers.  \nThe methodology adopted to identify the structural modes via ambient vibrations \nwas based on a least squares minimization of the measure of fit between the cross power \nspectral density (CPSD) matrix \n0 0ˆ( ; ) N NS k Cωψ ×∆ ∈  and the CPSD matrix, \n0 0( ; ) N NS k Cωψ ×∆ ∈  where 0N  is the number of measured degrees of freedom (DOF), \nω∆  is the discretization step in the frequency domain, { }1,...,k N ω= is the index set \ncorresponding to frequency values kω ω= ∆ , Nω is the number of data in the indexed \nset, and ψ is the parameter set to be estimated.

(2008) seven mode shapes (Figure 4a) \nwere reliably identified; three transverse modes, one longitudinal and three bending \nmodes of the deck. Their respective natural frequencies were in the range of 0.81HzR\n3.51Hz, as shown in Table 1 and they were deemed representative of the structural \ndynamic response since additional measurements conducted under alternative \nenvironmental conditions in terms of temperature and humidity led to similar modal data \nwith a discrepancy of less than 2%. \nNumerical modelling \nGeometry and assumptions \nA detailed FE model of the Kavala bridge was developed in ABAQUS 6.14 (Figure 4b), \nto numerically predict the modal characteristics of the bridge. In contrast to the, twoR\nnode, beamRtype finite elements used in the initial work of Ntotsios et al. (2008), this \nmodel used threeRdimensional, eightRnode, brickRtype finite elements (C3D8 type in \nABAQUS) to simulate the subsoil and all the structural components of the bridge \nincluding the deck, IRbeams, piers, bearings, caissons and abutments. The prestress forces \nin the girders were not simulated on the grounds of not significantly affecting the \ndynamic behaviour of prestressed beams (Hamed & Frostig, 2006). Overall, the \nnumerical model consists of approximately 247,000 hexahedral brick elements that \ncorrespond to 407,000 degrees of freedom. The mesh size was set equal to 0.75m for the \nPage 10 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nelements modelling the concrete sections, 0.25m for the bearings and 2m for the large \nvolume of soil. \nPrior to the development of the FE model, an inRsitu measurement of the bridge \ngeometry was performed to verify the drawings and update the ‘asRbuilt’ condition of the \nstructure. All materials are numerically assumed to be elastic, isotropic and homogenous. \nTheir nominal, uncracked values are given in Table 2. The subsoil static stiffness \n0E , \nwas considered equal to 3.5GPa, based on the geotechnical investigation report. The \nelastomeric laminated bearings are horizontally anchored at both ends through friction \nunder both operational and vibration monitoring conditions. However, due to the high \nfriction coefficient between the bearing and the top and bottom reinforced concrete \nsurfaces, the assumption of a full bong was made and the Abaqus “tie” constrain type was \nused.  \nFor the abutment backfill, a well compacted material was adopted with a Young’s \nmodulus equal to 60MPa (Taskari & Sextos, 2015). The volume of the soil surrounding \nthe caissons that was modelled was \n2 6 6C C CH D D× × , where CH  and CD  denote the \ncaisson height and diameter respectively (Figure 5). The abutment foundation soil \nvolume modelled was 5 62 A AW L l× × , with AW  being the abutment width, AL  the \nabutment height and l the abutment plus the embankment length El  (Figure 6).

Absorbing \nboundary conditions were not considered in the analysis since it was only modal analysis \nthat was employed without response in the time domain. A sensitivity analysis was \ncarried out to verify that the geometry of the selected soil mass did not affect by more \nthan 2% the predicted dynamic characteristics in comparison to an extensively refined FE \nmodel where the entire valley was modelled (Figure 7). \nModal analysis  \nThe numerically predicted dynamic characteristics of the threeRdimensional FE model \ndescribed above were compared with the structural modes identified via ambient \nvibrations by Ntotsios et al. (2008). As it is evident by the results summarized in Table 1 \n(Column 2), the initially developed numerical model fails to predict the measured \nresponse, as it exhibits large deviations from the identified modal frequencies. More \nspecifically, the initial FE frequency prediction is approximately 55% lower than the \nmeasured one in the longitudinal direction, and about 33% R 58% lower in the transverse \ndirection. In general, it is observed that the modes predicted by the initial 3D FE model \nare on average 32% lower than those measured via ambient vibrations, thus, the real \nstructure is identified as being significantly stiffer. This is mainly attributed to the fact \nthat the stiffness values used for the initial FE prediction were based on the bridge design \nbrief, which correspond to high levels of shear strain that are expected to occur in case of \nthe design earthquake (Yura, Kumar, Yakut, Topkaya, Becker & Collingwood, 2001). \nModel updating framework \nGiven the above discrepancies between the identified (i.e., measured) and the numerically \nPage 12 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\npredicted natural frequencies and the predicted response, a finite element model updating \nframework was deemed necessary to reduce the observed error. The parameters that were \nconsidered to be uncertain and assumed to potentially affect the efficiency of the initial \n3D FE model (Table 3) were: (i) the Young’s modulus of elasticity of the superstructure, \nincluding the deck and the IRbeams, hereafter termed deckθ , (ii) the modulus of elasticity \nof the piers, piersθ , (iii) the modulus of elasticity of the bearings used for the abutment \nand piers, bearθ and (iv) the stiffness of the backfill backθ . Note that the since the bearings \nare fully modelled using 3D (solid) elements, it is the Young’s modulus of the rubber that \nis to be updated (considering the modulus of the steel plates constant) and not the shear \nmodulus of the entire bearing that is typically used in case the bearing is modelled with a \n1D shear spring. Further, \nθ is defined as the aspect ratio of the updated over the initial \nparameter values, thus, the initial (nominal) FE model corresponds to parameter values \n1θ= . It is clarified that the influence of the backfill stiffness backθ  was found negligible \nas shown in Figure 1. This is due to the presence of the 25cm expansion joint between the \ndeck and the abutment, and the fact that the force transfer to the abutment is made \nthrough the bearing only, being almost directly transferred to the rock in which the \nabutment is founded.  \nThe same applies to the subsoil Young’s modulus, which was not updated, since \nits high value (3.5GPa) almost corresponds to fixedRbase conditions. Sensitivity analyses \nconfirmed that even a ±50% variation around its mean value did not affect the modal \ncharacteristics of the bridge. In fact, this was the primary reason for studying the \nparticular bridge, since its stiff soil conditions reduce the epistemic uncertainty associated \nwith model updating of the superstructure so that the soil stiffness itself can then be only \nvaried parametrically numerically for comparative investigation of different soils and \nfoundations. As shown in Table 3, the significant parameters to be updated are assumed \nPage 13 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nto be bounded within prescribed ranges of variation (i.e., 0.70< deckθ <1.30, 0.70< piersθ\n<1.30 and 1< bearθ <15), to avoid updating solutions that lack physical meaning. The \njustification for these bounding values is presented below. \nPier and deck constraints  \nThere is a series of factors that may affect the modulus of elasticity of concrete that is \nidentified using ambient vibrations in relation to its actual design value. First, the \nnominal design value of concrete is not calculated based on the results of compression \ntests of cored concrete samples but is instead assumed equal to the mean elastic modulus \nof concrete ( cmE ). Compression tests of cored concrete samples usually display a ±10% \ncovariance of the concrete Young’s modulus compared to the cmE . Moreover, according \nto the definition of the cmE  in Eurocode 2, this is calculated for higher strain levels (i.e., \nstrain levels that correspond to 40% of concrete’s mean compressive strength) than those \ndeveloped under ambient vibrations. Additionally, concrete strength increases with time \ndue to aging and this further increases its stiffness, for instance, by 5%R10% in 4 years, \nfor the case of cmE =34GPa, as defined in Eurocode 2. Overall, the identified modulus of \nelasticity of concrete can be indeed identified higher than the nominal one, however, this \nincrease shall not exceed 30% in total, hence, an upper bound for Young’s modulus equal \nto 1.3 is deemed reasonable.   \nOn the other hand, limited cracking in concrete sections induced by traffic loads, \ncan also decrease their stiffness after some years of bridge operation. More extensive \ncracking could be further identified for structures that experienced earthquake excitations \ndepending on their intensity. Considering that the bridge studied did not experience any \nstrong earthquake event since its construction in 2004, one shall not expect any decrease \nto the concrete Young’s modulus by more than 10%. In any case, the lower bound for \nPage 14 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nconcrete Young’s modulus was set to 0.7 to account for any other, potentially unknown, \nsource of damage. \nBearing constraints \nBased on similar studies of baseRisolated bridges (Chaudhary et al., 2001; Ntotsios et al., \n2008) and buildings (Stewart , Conte & Aiken, 1999), it is evident that at low level of \nexcitation, such as ambient vibrations, the identified values of the bearing stiffness can be \nup to 2R10 times greater than their nominal design ones. This is mainly due to the \nconstitutively different nonlinear behaviour of bearings at small (serviceability) shear \nstrain levels (γ<100%) and the ones expected during an earthquake ground motion \n(100%<γ<200%) that essentially dictate their design. Another reason for identifying \nhigher bearing stiffness compared to their nominal one is additional friction mechanisms, \ndislocations, aging, corrosion, humidity, etc. Based on the above considerations, bearing \nstiffness was bounded between 1 to 15. Notably, a lower bound below unity was not \nconsidered since the bridge was rather new and bearing damage was not deemed probable \nat least to such an extent that it would override the difference between ambient and \nearthquake vibration. \nEffect of alternative weighting factors on model updating results  \nThe natural frequencies of the updated numerical models of the Kavala bridge are \npresented in Table 1. Three cases are examined with different weighting factors for mode \nshape and natural frequencies matching (i.e., for case A the weighting factor \nw, is \nconsidered equal to 1, for case B equal to 0.5 and for case C equal to 0). It can be \nobserved that all the investigated model updating cases provide natural frequency \nestimates that are in good agreement with those identified via ambient vibration \nmeasurements. The average error in the natural frequencies is now reduced from 32.34% \nPage 15 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nto 1.89% for case A, to 1.78% for case B and to 1.72% for case C. Regarding the \nidentified and the numerically predicted mode shapes, good agreement is also observed, \nsince the MAC values at all three cases are close to 1, for all 7 considered modes.  \nThe optimal values of the significant structural parameters that were updated in \norder to reduce the initially observed discrepancies in the dynamic characteristics of the \ninitial (nominal) FEM, are summarized in Table 3. It can be observed that the three cases \nconclude to consistent results, regarding the Young’s modulus of elasticity \nE of the \nsuperstructure ( deckθ =1.19R1.21) and the bearings’ E modulus ( bearθ =11.63R11.99). On \nthe contrary, greater, though not excessive, deviation was predicted for the E modulus of \nthe piers, ( piersθ =1.12R1.25), showing that the piersθ  optimal value depends on the \nassumption made for the w weighting factor and the contributionof the mode shapes in \nthe objective function ( )Jθ . \nTaking into consideration that the three, equally legitimate, model updating cases \nprovide equally reliable results, but lead to different estimation of the piers’ stiffness, an \ninvestigation was made, to examine the reliability of the three estimations (12%, 18% or \n25% concrete stiffness increase). There are two things that need to be checked. One is \nwhether the nonRdamage prediction is valid in a seismic prone area, as that of the bridge \nstudied, and secondly to interpret the source of the identified stiffness increase. Along \nthese lines, data were collected from the national observatory of Athens database \nregarding the strong motion events (\nSM >4) that had taken place at the vicinity of the \nbridge for the period between 2004 (bridge construction year) and 2008 (when ambient \nvibration measurements took place).

Based on the rebound \nhammer graph, those R values correspond to characteristic compressive strength ckf  \nequal to 41.60MPa for M1 and 40MPa for M3. Eventually, the M1 and M3 piers’ Young’s \nmodulus of elasticity were predicted equal to 35.56GPa and 35.22GPa, respectively, \naccording to Eurocode 2:  \n \n0.3822 10\n+ =   \nck\ncm\nfE  (9) \nPage 17 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nThe results of the Schmidt rebound hammer indicate a 17% increase at the piers’ nominal \nE=30GPa modulus and are in closer agreement with the 18% increase, predicted by case \nB of model updating.  \nBased on the above detailed justification and considering that the two \nmeasurements (ambient vs. Schmidt tests) were conducted under similar temperature \nconditions (10ºC), the second model updating scenario (case B with a ‘balanced; \nweighting factor w=0.5) is deemed more reliable and is used thereafter.  \nEffect of alternative optimization algorithms \nAn investigation is next presented to compare the results obtained from the covariance \nmatrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMARES) algorithm with those obtained using \ndifferent algorithms available within the Matlab environment. For this, the model \nupdating framework, described in the previous sections, was repeated with three \nalternative Matlab local optimization algorithms: (i) \nfmincon interiorM point and (ii) \nfminunc quasiMΝewton, that are gradient based algorithms, as well as (iii) fminsearch that \nis a gradientRfree method that uses the simplex search method (Lagarias, Reeds, Wright \n& Wright, 1998). The optimal results obtained by the CMARES algorithm (Table 3, case \nB) are then comparatively assessed with the optimal solutions obtained by the three \nalternative algorithms (\nfmincon,  fminunc and  fminsearch).  \nAs illustrated in Figure 10 and Table 4, fmincon and fminunc converges \nprematurely in a neighbourhood of the optimum obtained by CMARES, failing to give \naccurate estimates of the model parameters (see Table 4), mainly due to the fact that the \ngradients are estimated numerically. Analytical estimation of the gradients to improve the \nestimates of gradientRbased optimization algorithms is possible for special cases of model \nparameterization but it was not pursued further in this manuscript.

Even though this investigation \nhas highlighted the computational advantages of fminsearch, employment of CMARES \nwas finally deemed necessary to ensure that the global optimum could be obtained and to \nverify that the fminsearch solution was not a local minimum.  \nEffect of alternative soil-foundation conditions \nSoilMfoundation stiffness assumptions \nHaving established a level of confidence regarding the dynamic behaviour of the 2 nd \nKavala bypass bridge and selecting the most suitable weighting factor and optimization \nalgorithm for the purposes of this study, a parametric analysis was then performed, \nutilizing the more reliable (as shown in the previous Section) updated numerical model \nFEM B (Table 1 and Figure 4b). In this parametric analysis, the actual subsoil stiffness (\n0SV =820 m/sec or 0E =3.5 GPa) was gradually numerically reduced in order to \ninvestigate how the dynamic characteristics in terms of natural frequencies, mode shapes \nand modal participation mass ratios of the Kavala bridge studied would be influenced. \nThree alternative types of soil profiles were investigated, according to the Eurocode 8 \nground classification, namely: rock (type A, \n,30SV > 800m/sec), dense sand, gravel  or \nstiff clay (type B, 360m/sec < 0SV < 800m/sec) and deep deposits of dense to medium \nsand (type C, 180m/sec < ,30SV < 360m/sec). The soil stiffness of the aforementioned \nprofiles corresponds to small ( γ <10R6) soil strain levels induced under ambient \nvibrations. Extremely soft soil conditions (type D, ,30SV < 180m/sec) require different \nfoundation systems and/or soil improvement and were not considered in the parametric \nstudy.  \nPage 19 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nFor the three alternative soil profiles studied herein (namely, types A, B and C) \nthree different foundation systems had to be designed. For the reference case of the rock \nsoil profile (type A), the actual foundation system of the bridge was kept unchanged, \nwhereas for the other two soil profiles (B and C) the foundation system was redesigned \naccording to the Eurocodes 7 and 8 (Figures 8 and 9), assuming that there were no \nconstructability limitations of the actual case study, such as the steep slope and landslide \nsusceptibility. The design quantities are indicatively summarized in Table 5 and Table 6, \nderived through response spectrum analysis of the soilRbridge system for each soil type as \nper Eurocode 8, adopting a behaviour factor q=1.8 based on the actual superstructure \ndesign and a peak ground acceleration of 0.16g, which is the design seismic acceleration \nat the site of interest. \nThe three resulting foundation configurations are summarized below: \n• Soil type A (actual, reference case): 6m diameter caissons of 9.80R12.20m length \n(Figure 5). \n• Soil type B (20m of dense sand down to the bedrock level): 7x7x2 rectangular \nshallow foundation (Figure 8). \n• Soil type C (20m of mediumRdense sand over 5m of soil B and a bedrock at a \ndepth of R25m): 3x3 pile group of 1m diameter at a spacing over diameter ratio \nS/D=2.0 with 23m length connected to a 6x6x2 pile cap, embedded by 3m into the \nstiffer subsoil B (Figure 9). Soil type B was assumed for the foundation subsoil of \nthe abutments.  \nThe water table was ignored in all cases.  \nModal characteristics for alternative soil profiles \nHaving updated the FE model for soil A (FEM B) and redesigned the foundation for soils \nPage 20 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nB and C, the anticipated natural frequencies f of the Kavala bridge, calculated \nnumerically for the three studied soil profiles, were normalized to the natural frequencies \n*f , calculated with the updated numerical model FEM B (Table 1) that considers the \nactual rock soil conditions ( 0SV =820 m/sec, type A) of the bridge. Therefore, the ratio \n/ *f f , in Figure 11, can be interpreted as a soilRstructure interaction index, illustrating \nhow the reduction of soil stiffness in terms of shear wave velocities affects the natural \nfrequencies of Kavala bridge. It is observed that, as anticipated, the natural frequencies of \nthe seven considered mode shapes reduce as soil stiffness reduces. Specifically, the \nnatural frequencies of the Kavala bridge reduce up to 8%  for type B (360m/sec < \n,30SV < \n800m/sec) of soil conditions founded on shallow foundations and up to 12% for type C \n(180m/sec < \n,30SV < 360m/sec) of soil conditions founded on a pile group.  \nThe influence of soil compliance on the modal participating mass ratios of Kavala \nbridge as computed using the modal analysis results of the developed FE models, is \nfurther shown in Figure 12. This figure illustrates that for type A rock soil and caisson \nfoundation, 78% of the structural mass is activated by the first transverse mode (T1), 91% \nby the first longitudinal mode (L1) and 33% by the first bending mode (B1) of the deck. \nIt is also shown that the reduction of soil stiffness for the case of soil type B with a \nshallow foundation or type C with a pile group, is not expected to influence significantly \n(<1%) the modal participation mass ratios in the transverse degree of freedom (\nyu ) \nassociated with mode T1 and longitudinal degree of freedom ( xu ), associated with mode \nL1. On the contrary, an approximately 30% increase is predicted for the modal \nparticipating mass ratios in the vertical degree of freedom (relevant to mode B1), for the \nsofter, type C, soil profile.  \nPage 21 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nThe Kavala bridge modal vectors, predicted for the actual soil conditions ( ,30SV\n=800 m/sec, type A, rock), are compared in Figure 13 with those predicted for the \nalternative values of  ,30SV  (for soils B and C), to examine the influence of soil \ncompliance on the mode shapes of Kavala bridge. The MAC criterion is used to calculate \nthe mode shapes correlation of the alternative soil compliant scenarios. For low ambient \nvibrations, where soil strain is less than 10\nR6, the Kavala bridge mode shapes were not \nfound to vary and deviations were less than 5% for the studied soil profiles (180m/sec < \n,30SV < 800m/sec).  \nSummarizing, it can be concluded that Kavala bridge dynamic characteristics as \nidentified by ambient vibrations were not significantly influenced by assuming different \nsoil profiles and subsequently redesigned foundations, except for soil type C (180m/sec < \n,30SV < 360m/sec) and a pile group foundation, where a variation of 12% was observed. \nNotably, in case of seismic excitation the potential influence of soil compliance is \nexpected to be significantly higher (Chaudhary et al., 2001), however, this is something \nthat cannot be captured by modal analysis and model updating based on ambient \nvibration measurements. \nConclusions \nThe present work examines the potential influence of soil compliance on the numerical \npredictions of the dynamic characteristics of a bridge in terms of natural frequencies, \nmodal participating mass ratios and mode shapes, in the framework of FE modelling for \nsystem identification purposes. It also investigates the conditions under which detailed \nsoil modelling is necessary to achieve a reliable system identification of the studied \nbridge. To facilitate the above purpose, the 2 nd Kavala bypass bridge in Greece is used as \na case study. This is a bridge founded on very stiff soil formations through a large caisson \nPage 22 of 47\nURL: http:/mc.manuscriptcentral.com/nsie\nStructure and Infrastructure Engineering\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nfoundation, thus minimizing the epistemic uncertainty associated with subsoil modelling. \nInitially, a reliable FE model of the structure is developed after refined model updating, \nutilizing ambient vibration measurements. Alternative weighting factors for natural \nfrequencies and mode shape matching are explored along with different optimization \nalgorithms to identify the most suitable approach for the problem studied. Having \nestablished a level of confidence for the FE modelling of the piers and superstructure, a \nparametric numerical analysis is then performed for three alternative soil profiles (type A, \nB and C according to Eurocode 8 or B, C and D to ASCE 7R10 site classification) and \nthree alternative foundation configurations that are redesigned to Eurocode 7 and 8 \ninvolving caissons, shallow foundations and pile groups. \n It is shown that for small soil strain levels (\nγ <10R6) that are induced under \nambient vibrations, the actual Kavala bridge dynamic characteristics (computed for soil \ntype A, ,30SV =800 m/sec) do not significantly (<1%) vary when the caissons compliance \nis accounted for, given that the system, as anticipated, is effectively responding as \npractically fixed at its base. For the bridge resting on soil type B and shallow foundations, \nrefined FE modelling of the soilRfoundation system leads to a variation of less than 10% \nin the identified natural frequencies. Greater deviations are shown for the case of type C \nand a pile group foundation, of the order of 12% in terms of natural frequencies, 30% \nmaximum increase in the modal participating mass ratios in the vertical direction and 5% \nin the mode shape vectors of the three bending modes.  \nIt is therefore shown that during model updating based on the identified natural \nfrequencies and modes of the bridge, the decision to consider subsoil compliance or \nassume foundation fixity, shall be based on the stiffness of the soilRfoundation subR\nsystem of the bridge and not on the properties (i.e., subsoil type) of the soil volume alone, \nas previously observed by Chaudhary, Abé & Fujino, 2001 .

This ratio is not as low as one would expect considering soil variation only, \nhowever, it is restrained by the design practice itself that tends to balance a softer soil \nformation with a stiffer foundation. Further research is required before making more \ngeneral statements involving different structural systems and spatially variable or softer \nsoil conditions.  \nAcknowledgments  \nThe authors would like to thank EGNATIA S.A. highway for providing the design \ndrawings of the bridge studied and to the anonymous Reviewers for their constructive \nfeedback. \nReferences \nABAQUS 6.14 [Computer software].
