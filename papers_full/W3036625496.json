This \nsystem, called PRIMA-eDS (polypharmacy in chronic \ndiseases: reduction of inappropriate medication \nand adverse drug events in older populations by \nelectronic decision support), automatically generates \na comprehensive drug review based on individual \npatient data and current best evidence\n6 to support \ndoctors in deprescribing.\nIn this multicentre cluster randomised controlled \ntrial we tested whether use of the electronic decision \nsupport tool led to a reduction in inappropriate \npolypharmacy and thus improvements in patient \nrelevant endpoints. Our principal hypothesis was \nthat deprescribing based on the electronic decision \nsupport tool would reduce the composite endpoint of \nunplanned hospital admission or death in patients \naged 75 or older.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial was \ncarried out in four countries. General practitioners \nwere recruited in five study centres: Manchester, \nUnited Kingdom; Bolzano, Italy; Salzburg, Austria; \nand Rostock and Witten, Germany. The doctors were \nrecruited between May 2013 and September 2015. \nParticipating doctors in turn recruited patients aged 75 \nor older who were using eight or more drugs on a regular \nbasis (including those prescribed by any doctor, and \nnon-prescription drugs). We decided to use the cut-off  \npoint of at least eight drugs based on a previous study.\n7 \n8 Patients were excluded if they had a life expectancy \nof less than 12 months, were unable to give informed \nconsent, or were receiving chemotherapy or radiation \nfor systemic malignant disease.\nDoctors in prespecified regions around each study \ncentre were informed about the trial and invited to \nparticipate. After they had agreed to participate and \nprovided written informed consent, we asked them to \nidentify all potentially eligible patients in their practice \nand to check them for inclusion and exclusion criteria. \nGroup practices were limited to one participating \ndoctor only. The doctors were then asked to recruit 11 \neligible patients at their discretion to participate in the \ntrial. Recruiting procedures varied slightly between \ncentres according to local conditions.\nOverall, 3904 patients were enrolled between \n7 January and 5 October 2015. A more detailed \ndescription of the PRIMA-eDS trial protocol is available \nelsewhere.\n9 Further details of the trial’s electronic \ndecision support tool and the randomised controlled \ntrial have been presented elsewhere,\n10 11 and baseline \ndata have been published previously.12\nRandomisation and masking\nAfter patient recruitment and baseline data collection \nhad been completed, we randomised the doctors \nto either the electronic decision support tool \n(intervention group) or treatment as usual (control \ngroup). Randomisation was at doctor level to avoid \ncontamination should a doctor use the decision \nsupport tool for some patients but not for others. \nA trial statistician masked to allocation performed \ncomputerised block randomisation, stratified by \nstudy centre to ensure balanced groups. Owing to the \nnature of the intervention, doctors, participants, and \nstudy assistants could not be blinded, but statisticians \nundertaking analyses were masked.\nProcedures\nThe trial’s observation period was two years. Follow-up \npatient consultations and data collection took place at \n8, 16, and 24 months. At each time point the doctor \nor an authorised staff member collected patient data \nand entered these into an electronic case report form \n(see appendix fig 3a). At some UK practices, a regional \nClinical Research Network research nurse working \nwith the practice assisted in data collection. During a \nroutine visit to the practice, the participant completed \non paper the SF-12v2 health survey, a shortened \nversion of the second version of the SF-36.\nThe intervention consisted of a computerised \ndecision support tool providing a comprehensive drug \nreview (see appendix figs 1a and 2a) generated from \npatient data recorded in the electronic case report \nform. The intervention is a novel and comprehensive \napproach to reducing potentially inappropriate and \nnon-evidence based polypharmacy. It is not limited \nto any specific drug or drug classes but rather uses an \nall inclusive approach to a patient’s drugs. It provides \na check of the indications for current drugs based \non recorded diagnoses; a summary of measurement \nresults with alerts; recommendations about amending \ncurrent drugs according to best available evidence; \nadvice on dosage adjustment in renal malfunction; \nalerts for potentially harmful drug-drug interactions; \nwarnings for possible contraindications; dose \nwarnings; and a table listing each current drug and \nthe associated degree of risk for nine common adverse \ndrug reactions (see table 1). Although the decision \nsupport tool was intended to encourage deprescribing \nof potentially inappropriate drugs, the final decisions \nabout treatment remained at the discretion of the \ndoctor and patient in a shared decision making \nprocess. The electronic decision support tool was web \nbased and could also be saved as a PDF and printed.\nThe baseline data collected on each participant \nconsisted of age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, \nall drugs (prescribed and over the counter) with an ATC \n(anatomic therapeutic chemical) code,\n27 all diagnoses \n(using the international classification of diseases, 10th \nrevision (ICD-10) codes\n28), smoking status, current \nsymptoms (within past month), medical procedures, \nfrailty (clinical frailty scale\n29), number of falls (during \npast three months), and laboratory values (creatinine, \nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on 5 November 2025 https://www.bmj.com/Downloaded from 18 June 2020. 10.1136/bmj.m1822 on BMJ: first published as \nRESEARCH\nthe bmj |  BMJ 2020;369:m1822 | doi: 10.1136/bmj.m1822  3\nblood glucose, alanine aminotransferase, glycated \nhaemoglobin (HbA 1c), platelet count, international \nnormalised ratio, cholesterol, low density lipoprotein \ncholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, \ntriglycerides, potassium, and sodium) when available. \nWe also recorded health related quality of life (SF-\n12v2: physical and mental component scores\n30) and \neducational level (international standard classification \nof education 1997 (ISCED-97)\n31). The participating \ndoctors were advised to collect up to date data at a \nroutine appointment. All these data, including primary \nand secondary outcomes, were recorded by the doctors \nor their staff in the electronic case report form and \nstored centrally on a server designated to this study.\nAfter randomisation, doctors in the intervention \ngroup were given access to the computerised decision \nsupport tool. They received training and instructions \non use, interpretation of the output, the evidence base \nunderpinning the output, and the principles of shared \ndecision making. Training was provided face to face, by \nwebinar and by video tutorials through the PRIMA-eDS \nwebpage. A telephone hotline was available to doctors \nin case of questions. Doctors in the intervention group \nwere instructed to use the electronic decision support \ntool directly after randomisation, and at all three follow-\nup consultations. Furthermore, they were free to use the \nelectronic decision support tool at any other time point.\nDoctors in the control group treated participants \naccording to their normal practice and only completed \nelectronic case report forms at the scheduled follow-\nup visits. They were free to change any drug if they \nthought it appropriate, but they did not have access \nto the electronic decision support tool to guide their \ndecision making.\nDoctors in both groups were instructed to collect \nthe data during routine appointments. They were \nnot specifically asked to make extra appointments \nwhenever possible for the study, but were free to do so \nif they wished.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was a composite of unplanned \nhospital admission or death from any cause during the two \nyear observation period. We combined these measures \ninto a composite endpoint because they can be competing \noutcomes. The key secondary outcome was the number \nof drugs prescribed at final follow-up, controlling for \nbaseline, in line with the key objective of the intervention \nto reduce inappropriate prescribing. Other secondary \noutcomes were unplanned hospital admission and all \ncause mortality (as single endpoints), self-reported falls, \nrecorded fractures, adverse drug reactions (symptoms), \nand quality of life. We further examined the number and \ntypes of recommendations given by the decision support \ntool to improve drug appropriateness.\nAt each follow-up visit the practice staff collected \ndata pertaining to each outcome and entered these \ninto the electronic case report form, with the exception \nof the SF-12, which was collected on a paper form at \neight and 24 months. Practice staff recorded ongoing \ndata on patients who dropped out or died.\nStatistical analysis\nThe sample size was based on binary analysis to \ntest superiority of the primary composite endpoint \non unplanned hospital admission or death within \ntwo years. We powered the study to detect a relative \nrisk reduction of 20% in the decision support group \nat 80% power and an α level of 5%, assuming an \nintracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01 (based on an \nearlier cluster trial\n32) and a 10% attrition rate in both \npatients and practices.9 On this basis we required 3542 \npatients across 322 general practices with a mean of \n11 participants in each practice. About 10% excess \nrecruitment over this was achieved in the actual trial.\nAn independent statistician blind to trial group \nallocation analysed the data following a prespecified \nstatistical analysis plan. Mixed effect multilevel models \nwere applied, with participants nested within general \npractices, grouped within study centres. We treated \nthe practices as a random effect and the five centres as \nfixed effects.\nWe applied linear models for continuous outcomes, \nlogistic for binary outcomes, Poisson or negative \nbinomial (when the Poisson was not a good fit) for \ncounts, and Cox regression for time-to-event outcomes. \nTable 1 | Components of the computerised decision support tool for comprehensive drug review in people with \npolypharmacy for chronic diseases\nComponents Data sources\nCheck of indications for current drugs Evidence-Based Medicine Guidelines and evidence summary \ncollection13\nMeasurement results (laboratory, anthropometric) with alerts Evidence-Based Medicine Guidelines 13 and consensus of EBMeDS \nclinical editorial team 14\nRecommendations about amending current drugs based on best \navailable evidence\nEBMeDS evidence based rules and reminders.\n15 Systematic reviews \non drugs commonly prescribed to older people 6 16-21 \nEU(7)-PIM list 22\nDosage adjustment in renal malfunction RENBASE database23\nPotentially harmful drug-drug interactions INXBASE database24\nContraindications Pharmacological literature and summary of medicinal product \ncharacteristics by European Medicines Agency\n25\nDose warnings Pharmacological literature and product summaries approved by \nregulatory authorities\nPossible adverse drug reactions (risk of bleeding, renal toxicity, risk \nof seizures, anticholinergic effects, constipation, orthostatism, QT \nprolongation, sedation, serotonergic effect)\nRISKBASE database\n26\nEbMeDS=evidence based medicine electronic decision support; EU(7)-PIM=European Union (7)-potentially inappropriate medications.\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on 5 November 2025 https://www.bmj.com/Downloaded from 18 June 2020. 10.1136/bmj.m1822 on BMJ: first published as \nRESEARCH\n4 d oi: 10.1136/bmj.m1822  |  BMJ 2020;369:m1822 | the bmj\nBaseline outcome values were included as covariates \nin the relevant model when available (number of \nfalls, number of drugs, SF-12 physical and mental \ncomponent scores) along with four prespecified \ncovariates, judged prognostic of outcomes: participant \nsex, age, number of drugs prescribed at baseline, \nand number of medical diagnoses, with the last three \ntreated as continuous variables. These and all other \ncollected variables were well balanced between trial \narms (see table 2).\nAll models included a fixed factor for study centre \nin line with the randomisation scheme and to \ncontrol for any within country imbalance in patient \nnumbers between trial arms. Baseline data indicated \nhigh heterogeneity in patient populations between \ncountries, so to reduce risk of bias from factors such as \nSimpson’s paradox, we also adjusted for the interaction \nbetween treatment group and study centre. We then \nused a post-estimation contrast to estimate and test the \nmean effect between trial arms.\nBaseline data were missing only on one variable—\nnumber of diagnoses—and for only six participants \n(0.15%). Before further analysis we imputed these \nmissing values using simple linear regression based \non age, sex, number of drugs, and study centre.\n33 In \nline with the trial protocol, 9 we analysed missing \n24 month follow-up data on the primary outcome \nas reaching the endpoint, with sensitivity analysis \nperformed using multiple imputation with the chained \nequations procedure and 10 multiple imputation \ndatasets, utilising the full set of variables, including \nthe interaction term between group and study centre. \nFor the key secondary outcome of number of drugs, \nwhere 24 month follow-up data was missing we used \nthe last recorded value (at eight or 16 months) and \ncontrolled for number of consultations attended; we \nalso conducted a multiple imputation sensitivity using \nimputed values at 24 months.\nFor other secondary outcomes, when 24 month \nfollow-up data were missing we analysed the last \nrecorded outcome score and, when appropriate (ie, \nfor number and duration of hospital admission and \nnumber of falls), controlled for length of time in the \ntrial as an exposure factor. We treated SF-12 scores \nas completely missing if they were not collected at 24 \nmonths.\nWhen the data suggested that an outcome lacked \nadequate fit to the assumed distribution, we checked \nstatistical significance using bootstrapped standard \nerrors, based on 1000 bootstrapped samples and \nrandomly assigned seed values. We also ran sensitivity \nanalyses to assess the stability of key results to \nmodel specifications: analysing unplanned hospital \nadmission and death as time-to-event variables rather \nthan as binary outcomes, with patients censored \non reaching the outcome or loss to follow-up; and \nanalysing change in number of drugs from baseline as \na continuous variable, in place of number of drugs at \nlast follow-up as a Poisson count.\nIn addition to the primary intention-to-treat analysis, \nwe re-ran all analyses with the sample restricted to \npatients who fully followed the trial protocol. For \nthe per protocol sample we excluded a small number \nof participants who, although randomised, did not \nmeet the trial criteria of using eight or more drugs at \nbaseline or age 75 or older (n=60) and a larger number \nwho officially withdrew (or were withdrawn when \ntheir practice withdrew) before the 24 month follow-\nup (n=349), or did not attend the 24 month follow-up \n(n=101).\nNo adjustment for multiple testing was applied and \nan α value of 5% was used throughout. Analyses were \nconducted using Stata V15, with the exception of \ndata derived from the electronic decision support tool \n(number and types of recommendations generated), \nwhich were analysed using SPSS V24.\nMonitoring\nStaff independent of the research team at each \nstudy centre carried out monitoring according to a \nprespecified protocol. An independent safety and \ndata monitoring committee, masked to randomisation \nallocation, regularly reviewed the accumulated trial \ndata for safety reasons. However, no concerns arose to \nterminate the trial.\nPatient and public involvement\nNo patients were involved in setting the research \nquestion or developing plans for design of the study, \nnor were they asked to advise on interpretation or \nwriting up of results.\nResults\nA total of 359 practices recruited 3904 participants. \nAfter randomisation, the computerised decision \nsupport group consisted of 181 practices and 1953 \nparticipants (intervention group) and the treatment \nas usual group of 178 practices and 1951 patients \n(control group). The characteristics of the two groups \nwere similar at baseline (table 2). On average, the \nparticipants were aged 81.5 (SD 4.4) years, used 10.5 \n(SD 2.4) drugs, and had 9.5 (SD 4.9) diagnoses; 2240 \n(57.4%) were women. Small numbers of practices \nand participants were lost between follow-ups owing \nto withdrawal or death (fig 1). Final follow-up data \nwere collected for 77% of participants (88% including \ndeaths).\nPrimary outcome\nOf 1953 participants in the intervention group, \n871 (44.6%) experienced the primary outcome of \nunplanned admission to hospital or death by 24 \nmonths, and a further 126 (6.5%) were lost to follow-\nup. Of 1951 participants in the control group, 944 \n(48.4%) were admitted to hospital or died, and a \nfurther 111 (5.7%) were lost to follow-up. In an \nintention-to-treat analysis (in which participants who \nwere lost to follow-up were included as having reached \nthe outcome) no evidence was found of a difference \nbetween the intervention and control groups (odds \nratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.07; \nP=0.19).

A new dataset was recorded each time \na participant’s drug was changed or a study visit was \nmade. The doctors in the intervention group created \n18.7 (SD 8.8) datasets for each participant throughout \nthe study, whereas doctors in the control group created \nonly 12.1 (SD 5.1) datasets.\nDiscussion\nThis large randomised controlled trial of elderly \npeople (≥75 years) with polypharmacy investigated the \neffects of a decision support tool for comprehensive \ndrug review provided electronically to doctors. No \nconclusive evidence was found that first unplanned \nadmission to hospital or all cause mortality differed \nbetween the intervention and treatment as usual \n(control) groups, but the number of drugs was reduced \nin the intervention group.\nEven though we found no conclusive evidence in the \nintention-to-treat analysis for an effect on the primary \noutcome, the upper 95% confidence interval of the \nodds ratio of 1.07 (which corresponds to an estimated \n3% increase in risk\n34) makes it unlikely that the \nreduction in drugs prompted by the decision support \ntool leads to any appreciable increase in number of \nhospital admissions or deaths, as does the statistically \nsignificant reduction in hospital admissions or deaths \namong participants visiting their general practice \naccording to protocol. Taken together, the results \nsuggest that the number of drugs was reduced without \nincreasing harm to patients, which is a positive result \nin itself.\n35\nIt might be possible that the two year observation \nperiod was too short to observe a clear positive effect. \nThis is also suggested by the Kaplan-Meier survival \nplot of combined hospital admissions and deaths, \nas the curves for both treatment groups split after \nabout a year and gradually move apart. Although the \ndegree of deprescribing appears modest (on average \n0.45 drugs from a baseline of 10.5), at the population \nlevel this would represent a substantial reduction in \noverall treatment burden and in prescribing costs. \nThat deprescribing was directly related to use of \nthe electronic decision support tool is supported \nby the corresponding reduction in the number of \nrecommendations appearing in follow-up drug \nreviews for intervention participants compared with \ncontrols, which in itself implies improvement of drug \nappropriateness.\nTable 3 | Primary and secondary outcomes at last follow-up\nOutcomes\nDecision support group Control group Adjusted comparison estimate \n(95% CI) P value (sensitivities)No Estimate* No Estimate*\nPrimary outcome\nFirst unplanned hospital admission or death† 1953 997 (51.0%) 1951 1055 (54.1%) OR: 0.88 (0.73 to 1.07) 0.19 (MI‡ 0.114)\nSensitivity: time to first unplanned hospital \nadmission or death 1953 0.46 (0.01)§ 1951 0.50 (0.01)§ HR: 0.93 (0.82 to 1.05) 0.24\nKey secondary outcome\nLast recorded No of drugs 1953 10.12 (3.01) 1951 10.52 (2.94) Coefficient¶: 0.95 (0.94 to 0.97) <0.001 (MI<0.001) (BS<0.001)\nSensitivity: change in No of drugs from baseline 1953 −0.42 (2.16) 1951 0.06 (2.04) MD: −0.45 (−0.63 to -0.26) <0.001 (MI<0.001) (BS<0.001)\nOther secondary outcomes\nDeath† 1953 380 (19.5%) 1951 366 (18.8%) OR: 1.01 (0.73 to 1.38) 0.96\nSensitivity: time to death 1953 0.11 (0.01)§ 1951 0.12 (0.01) § HR: 0.90 (0.71 to 1.13) 0.35\nFirst unplanned hospital admission† 1953 945 (48.4%) 1951 990 (50.7%) OR: 0.92 (0.76 to 1.10) 0.36\nSensitivity: time to hospital admission 1953 0.49 (0.01)§ 1951 0.52 (0.01)§ HR: 0.95 (0.83 to 1.07) 0.38\nNo of unplanned hospital admission 1953 0.76 (1.24) 1951 0.87 (1.34) IRR: 0.91(0.69 to 1.20) 0.51 (BS 0.351)\nDuration of unplanned hospital admission (days) 1949 7.89 (17.43) 1948 8.47 (18.18) IRR: 0.95 (0.67 to 1.35) 0.79 (BS 0.707)\nNo of falls over trial period 1798 0.50 (1.26) 1785 0.51 (1.24) IRR: 1.08 (0.88 to 1.34) 0.44 (BS 0.287)\n≥1 fractures during trial period 1953 59 (3.0%) 1951 45 (2.3%) OR: 1.37 (0.87 to 2.16) 0.17\nSF-12:\n Ph\nysical component score (0-100) 1223 36.73 (9.44) 1146 36.32 (9.11) MD: 0.07 (-0.69 to 0.83) 0.85\n M\nental component score (0-100) 1224 46.66 (11.09) 1145 46.27 (11.18) MD: 0.34 (-0.69 to 1.37) 0.52\nOR=odds ratio; MI=multiple imputation; HR=hazard ratio; BS=bootstrap; MD=mean difference; IRR=incidence rate ratio.\n*Mean (standard deviation) or number (%) unless otherwise indicated.\n†Participants who dropped out were analysed as having reached the endpoint.\n‡Participants who dropped out were analysed using multiple imputation.\n§Estimated proportion (standard error) reaching endpoint by 24 months, from survivor function.\n¶Coefficient represents the adjusted ratio of the number of prescribed drugs in participants assigned to electronic decision support versus those assigned to treatment as usual (control group).\nDays since baseline\nNo at risk Proportion alive or not\nadmitted to hospital\n0 200 400 600 800\n1951\n1953\nTreatment as usual group\nElectronic decision support group\n1587\n1616\n1272\n1282\n1019\n1055\n0\n0\nTreatment as usual group\nElectronic decision support group\n0\n40\n60\n100\nHazard ratio (95% CI) = 0.93 (0.82 to 1.05); P = 0.24\n80\n20\nFig 2 | Kaplan-Meier survival plot of time to death or first unplanned hospital admission \nfor participants assigned to an electronic decision support tool or treatment as usual \n(control group): results from intention-to-treat analysis\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on 5 November 2025 https://www.bmj.com/Downloaded from 18 June 2020. 10.1136/bmj.m1822 on BMJ: first published as \nRESEARCH\n8 d oi: 10.1136/bmj.m1822  |  BMJ 2020;369:m1822 | the bmj\nStrengths and weaknesses of this study\nWe postulate that the results of our large randomised \ncontrolled trial are generalisable to the wider elderly \npopulation. Since most of the participants were not \nfrail, however, our results might not translate so well \nto a frailer population.\nAnother strength of our trial was the two year \nobservation period, which is longer than in most other \ntrials in this specialty. The pragmatic nature of the trial \nprovides real world evidence of a clinically relevant \nintervention. That the electronic decision support \ntool was not always used as intended, as shown by \nour process evaluation,\n10 11  reflects daily clinical \npractice. However, this reduces potential effectiveness \nof the tool, which might be reflected by the differing \nresult between our intention-to-treat and per protocol \nanalyses.\nThe lack of blinding of doctors and patients because \nof the nature of the trial could be considered a \nweakness. However, we collected baseline data before \nrandomisation to assure allocation concealment, and \nwe blinded all statisticians involved in data analysis to \nminimise bias.\nAlso, selection bias might have occurred when \ndoctors identified participants. We advised the doctors \nto select a random sample of eligible patients, but we \nwere not able to verify this owing to the pragmatic \nnature of the trial. Besides, not all doctors followed the \ninstructions to include 11 patients—recruitment varied \nfrom 1 to 30 participants per practice.\nAs our trial was international it has the advantage \nthat we were able to test the electronic decision support \ntool in various healthcare settings, thus increasing \ngeneralisability. Important differences do, however, \nexist between the participating countries. Italy and \nthe UK have a primary care centred healthcare system, \nhence although we standardised instructions for the \nrecording of data, Italian and British doctors might have \nhad a better overview of all drug data and diagnoses \ncompared with German and Austrian doctors. Any \nimpact of this should be balanced between groups by \nthe stratified randomisation within research centres, \nand we adjusted for centre effects in the analysis.\nIn addition, true drug consumption is difficult to \nassess: we instructed doctors to ask their patients \nabout all current drugs, but we were not able to verify \nactual drug consumption.\nWe used a cluster design to avoid contamination \nof the treatment as usual group. However, control \ndoctors were aware of the purpose of the trial and this, \ntogether with regular completion of the electronic case \nreport form plus any additional patient consultations, \nmight have resulted in more changes to drugs among \ncontrols than under typical usual care. Any effects of \nthis on outcomes would have been conservative in that \nit would have tended to reduce differences between the \ntreatment groups.\nWe were not able to assess whether drug related \nhospital admissions or other drug specific adverse \nevents were reduced; however, drugs often associated \nwith preventable hospital admissions such as \nantiplatelets or diuretics\n36 were among the commonly \ndeprescribed drugs in the electronic decision support \ngroup.\nA weakness of the decision support tool is that \nit cannot deal with individual patient needs. The \ntool is intended to support doctors and provide \nadditional useful information that would otherwise \nbe time consuming to obtain. It will never be able to \nreplace doctor care as it relies entirely on data that \nare encoded and extracted from the patient record. \nIt cannot consider patient preferences. For optimal \ndrug treatment it is therefore important that doctors \ndiscuss the recommendations provided by the \ndecision support tool in a shared decision making \nprocess with patients. Although we asked doctors in \nour trial to use the decision support tool as instructed, \nour process evaluation showed that not all doctors \ncomplied. This probably led to a lower adherence to \nthe recommendations of the tool.\nComparison with other studies\nPrevious research on the appropriate use of drugs \nin people with polypharmacy consists of a range \nof interventions in different settings using diverse \nstudy designs and outcomes. Few interventions have \nprovided electronic decision support to doctors in their \nown practice.\n4 Although several studies have shown \nsome positive effects, mainly on drug appropriateness, \nin general these interventions had little or no effect on \nhospital admission\n4 or all cause mortality. 5 Our study \nalso did not find a conclusive effect on these outcomes, \nbut per protocol analysis and the Kaplan-Meier-curve \nmake it likely that proper use of the decision tool for a \nlonger period could be beneficial.\nDespite different definitions of number of drugs used \nand considerable heterogeneity in results, a systematic \nreview of polypharmacy interventions estimated a \nmean reduction in drug numbers of 0.2 under the \nintervention but an increase of 0.2 under the control \ncondition.\n5 This is consistent with our finding of a \nreduction of 0.45 between groups.\nImplications of the findings and suggestions for \nfuture research\nWe postulate that the evidence derived from this study \nis strong enough to support implementation of the \nelectronic decision support tool for comprehensive \ndrug review on a wider scale. Furthermore, efforts \nat the policy level are needed to provide resources \nto use the tool in daily practice routine, discuss \nthe recommendations of the tool with patients in a \nshared decision making process, and deprescribe \ninappropriate drugs during regular consultations. \nEventually, this should lead to an improved integration \nof the support tool into doctors’ workflow.\nFuture efforts should focus on integrating the \ndecision support tool into the electronic health records \nused by doctors, as the extra entry of patient data into \nthe electronic case report form is time consuming.\n11 \nConsideration should also be given to adding drug start \nrecommendations to the electronic decision support \nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on 5 November 2025 https://www.bmj.com/Downloaded from 18 June 2020. 10.1136/bmj.m1822 on BMJ: first published as \nRESEARCH\nthe bmj |  BMJ 2020;369:m1822 | doi: 10.1136/bmj.m1822  9\ntool to avoid underuse. Widespread implementation of \nan adapted version of the tool should be accompanied \nby research to assess intended and unintended effects \nin daily routine practice.\nConclusions\nAlthough no conclusive evidence for the reduction \nof a composite of unplanned hospital admission \nor death was found within the follow-up period of \ntwo years, a reduction in prescribing was achieved \nwithout detriment to patient outcomes. We feel this \nevidence is strong enough to support implementation \nof the electronic decision support tool on a wider \nscale, preferably integrated within electronic health \nrecords.\nAUTHOR AFFILIATIONS\n1Institute of General Practice and Family Medicine, Witten/Herdecke \nUniversity, Alfred-Herrhausen-Strasse 50, 58448 Witten, Germany\n2National Institute for Health Research School for Primary Care \nResearch, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester, UK\n3Institute of General Practice, Rostock University Medical Center, \nRostock, Germany\n4Institute of General Practice, Family Medicine and Preventive \nMedicine, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria\n5Centre for Biostatistics, School for Health Sciences, University of \nManchester, UK\n6Department of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, \nRuhr-University Bochum, Germany\n7Duodecim Medical Publications, Helsinki, Finland\n8Institute for General Practice of Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy\n9Institute for Mountain Emergency Medicine, Eurac Research, \nBolzano, Italy\n10Department of General Practice and Family Medicine, Center of \nPublic Health, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria\nWe thank the participating doctors and patients; the PRIMA-eDS \nteam for their support in conducting the trial—in particular, Annette \nBarber, Vicky Bell, Barbara Faller, Jennifer Höck, Anna Renom-Guiteras, \nSophie Keller, Celine Kriechmayr, Joonas Mäkinen, Yolanda Martinez, \nPeter Nyberg, Giulio Pirolo, Angela Swallow, Anne-Lisa Teichmann, \nSabine Weißbach, and Martina Valentini; the SVEMG (Società Veneta \ndi Medicina Generale) for its support in recruiting doctors in Italy; \nand the five National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research \nNetworks that supported recruitment in the UK (Eastern, North \nEastern, Wales, North West Coast, and Greater Manchester).\nContributors: AS (primary investigator), MF, IK, and AE conceptualised \nthe development of the electronic decision support tool and the \nPRIMA-eDS project.
