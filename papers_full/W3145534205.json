INTRODUCTION\nTransformers are an important component of the power sys-\ntem for the transmission of electricity and are more expensive\nto maintain and monitor than other power generation and\ntransmission equipment. When a transformer is damaged,\nit not only incurs high repair or replacement costs but may\nalso result in greater economic losses due to the temporary\nloss of power transmission capacity of the power system.\nTherefore, for the safe and stable operation of the power\nsystem, power transformers need to be studied for failure\nprevention to avoid affecting normal power transmission.\nThe power transformer faults studied in this paper refer\nmainly to the winding vibrations caused by electromagnetic\nforces in the presence of high currents and the resulting\ndamage to the insulation between the transformer windings.\nOne of the ﬁrst concerns and discussions about this phe-\nnomenon was the high current action of short-circuit currents.\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Hui Ma\n.\nThe literature [1] used the ﬁeld-path coupling method to\ncalculate the leakage magnetic ﬁeld and the short-circuit\nelectromagnetic force under short-circuit conditions, and the\nwinding ﬂexure analysis according to the actual parameters\nto study the spoke stability of the winding. Transient analysis\nis used to determine the location of maximum transformer\nwinding deformation, and dynamics analysis is performed\nat this location to determine whether spoke instability will\noccur. In [2], a comparative analysis of the low-voltage wind-\ning of a dual-winding transformer with a distributed structure\nunder different short-circuit conditions was carried out using\nthe ﬁeld-path coupling method, and the leakage and the elec-\ntromagnetic forces generated in each case were analyzed. The\nliterature [3], [4] analyses the electromagnetic characteristics\nof the transformer windings and the dynamic characteristics\nof the electromagnetic forces in the case of short-circuit\ncurrent shocks using the ﬁnite element method. The varia-\ntion patterns of the winding forces and displacements were\nobtained, and the electromagnetic forces and displacements\non the middle and both ends of the winding were compared.\nVOLUME 9, 2021\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.\nFor more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ 73335\nC. Zhanget al.: Comprehensive Analysis of Winding Electromagnetic Force and Deformation\nIn the literature [5], the effect of the width of the spacer on\nthe critical yield stress of the winding was analyzed using\nthe ﬁnite element method, and a method for calculating the\ncritical yield stress of the transformer winding was proposed.\nIn some cases, the no-load operation of the transformer\nwill produce a large excitation inrush current, the duration\nof the excitation inrush current can reach tens of seconds,\nits amplitude not only far exceeds the rated current of the\ntransformer, and even exceed the peak short-circuit current.\nExcessive excitation inrush current can lead to transformer\nwinding deformation, damage winding insulation, and cause\ndifferential protection false operation, affecting the safe and\nstable operation of the power system. Normally, transformers\nare tested for short-circuit resistance, but tests relating to\ntransformer excitation inrush currents are not abundant.\nAt present, research on transformer excitation inrush is\nfocused on the identiﬁcation of the excitation current ﬂow,\nand a series of research results have been achieved. In [6]\na new controlled switching control strategy is proposed to\nreduce the excitation inrush taking into account core satura-\ntion and residual ﬂux. A transient transformer model based\non electrical and magnetic circuits is also proposed. A com-\nparison of experimental and simulation results shows that the\nabove proposed scheme can effectively reduce the excitation\ninrush current. However, the non-linearity, randomness, and\ndiversity of the excitation current make the existing solutions\nimperfect.\nIt is important to study in-depth the mechanism of the\ngeneration of excitation inrush current and to fully grasp the\nlaw of its variation, the effect on the transformer winding,\nand the difference with the short-circuit current. In the litera-\nture [7] a mathematical expression for the transient variation\nof the magnetic ﬁeld is obtained by solving a differential\nequation. At the same time, the expression is expressed as an\nalternative form of the iterative equation. Through simulation,\nthe ﬂux and current relationship curves are obtained and the\ncharacteristics of the variation of the relationship curves and\nthe corresponding causes are analyzed. Finally, through the\nderivation of the formula, the reason for the decay of the\nexcitation inrush current, the variation law of the decay rate\nof the excitation inrush current, and the factors affecting the\ndecay rate of the excitation inrush current are analyzed. How-\never, on this basis, the comparative analysis of the impact of\nexcitation current and short-circuit current on the transformer\nwinding is less studied. Literature [8] used a 15 KVA con-\ncentric double-winding single-phase transformer as a model\nusing ﬁnite element analysis to analyze the magnetomechan-\nical effects of transformer windings under the same condi-\ntions of excitation inrush current and short-circuit current.\nIn [9], a two-dimensional and three-dimensional model of a\nthree-phase transformer was established to analyze the forces\nand deformation of the transformer winding for different peak\nratios of excitation inrush and short-circuit currents. In [10],\na 50 MVA transformer is modeled and the peak excitation\ninrush current is obtained by transient simulation. The radial\nand axial forces on the transformer winding under the peak\nand the deformation of the winding under electromagnetic\nforces are analyzed. The literature [11] begins to propose a\nmodel that takes into account the change in leakage induc-\ntance under transient conditions and takes the transformer\ngeometry into account. The electromagnetic forces generated\nby short-circuit currents and excitation inrush are analyzed\nby combining the Jiles-Atherton model with a ﬁxed-point\niterative approach, taking into account the hysteresis charac-\nteristics of the core.\nAt present, most of the research on excitation inrush is\nthe principle of analysis, identiﬁcation, and inhibition, for\nshort-circuit current and excitation inrush on the transformer\nwinding impact involved and most of them only analyze\nthe difference between the two generating electromagnetic\nforce, for both the principle of comparison and generation\nof magnetic ﬁeld difference is not described. In this paper,\nwe will compare the principles of both, magnetic ﬁeld dis-\ntribution, electromagnetic force size, and other aspects of\nthe short-circuit current and excitation inrush current of a\ncomprehensive analysis. The ﬁeld-path coupling method is\ncombined with ﬁnite element analysis to model a 66.7 KVA\ntransformer with dual windings and to analyze the electrome-\nchanical characteristics of the transformer windings during\nexcitation inrush and short-circuit currents. A comprehen-\nsive comparison of the electromechanical characteristics of\nthe windings produced by both is analyzed by the leakage\nmagnetic ﬁelds generated by both and the effects of both on\nthe windings and conclusions are drawn.\nII. FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS\nA. CALCULATION OF SHORT-CIRCUIT CURRENT\nShort-circuit faults can be divided into three-phase, two-\nphase, and single-phase short-circuits, with three-phase\nshort-circuits producing the largest fault currents. The\nshort-circuit current can be obtained from the following for-\nmula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU =Um sin(ωt +θ)\n=Lsc\ndisc\ndt +iscrsc\nisc = Um√\nr2sc +(ωLd )2\n[\nsin(ωt +θ−α) −sin(θ−α)e\nrsc\nLsc\n]\n(1)\nwhere: isc is the symmetrical short-circuit current, A; Lsc is\nthe system short-circuit inductance; rsc is the short-circuit\nimpedance value; U is the rated voltage, V .\nAssuming rsc/Lsc =0, the short-circuit current is maxi-\nmum when O is assumed to be 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n√\n2Isc =100\n√\n2\nVsc\nIn\nIsc = Um√\nr2sc +(ωLd )2\n(2)\n73336 VOLUME 9, 2021\nC.

Short circuit high and low voltage winding current waveform.\nAs shown in Figure 1 is a single-phase transformer sudden\nshort-circuit, high-voltage, and low-voltage side of the short\ncircuit current waveform.\nB. CALCULATION OF EXCITATION INRUSH CURRENT\nUnder normal stable operation, the no-load excitation current\nof a transformer is 2%-10% of the rated current, and for large\ntransformers, it is even less than 1%. However, when the\ntransformer is closed at no load or when the transformer is\nreclosed at fault, the excitation current will increase sharply\ndue to the over-saturation of the iron core, forming an excita-\ntion inrush. Compared to the short-circuit current, the excita-\ntion inrush current has more high-frequency generation, the\ngreater the hazard and other characteristics.\nThe transformer needs to go through a transient mode after\nreclosing before it can reach steady state mode. The voltage\nwaveform, the phase angle at the moment of closing the\nswitch, and the amplitude and direction of the remanence\nare the main factors in how long the transient mode can be\nmaintained. When the secondary side is open, the current on\nthe primary side may increase to more than ten times the\nrated transformer current. Neglecting the winding resistance\nvalues, the relationship between the voltage Um sin (ωt +t)\nand the magnetic ﬂux φcan be expressed as\nu =N dφ\ndt =Um sin(ω1t +α) (3)\nN is the number of turns on the primary side of the winding,\nand the integration of the two side yields φas.\nφ=−φm cos(ω1t +α) +φm +φr (4)\nwhere φr is the residual magnetism in the core, i.e. φ(0) =φr .\nAt the same time, the excitation inrush current is related to\nthe primary side inductance LT and the applied voltage u as\nfollows.\nu =−L T\ndi\ndt (5)\nTherefore, the excitation inrush can be expressed as.\ni = 1\nLT\n∫\nUm sin(ωt +α) (6)\nFIGURE 2.

LEAKAGE FIELD ANALYSIS AND CALCULATION\nWhen a large power transformer fails, the leakage ﬁeld\nin the air gap will increase dramatically, and the rapidly\nincreasing leakage ﬁeld will lead to increased losses, com-\nponent overheating, and even winding structure deformation,\nwhich seriously threatens the stability and reliability of the\ntransformer as well as the operation of the entire power\ngrid.\nThe path of the leakage ﬂux is divided into four main\ncomponents.\n(a) Forming a closed circuit of the air gap between the\nwinding.\n(b) Flowing through the insulated parts of the upper end of\nthe winding into the core clamp to form a closed circuit.\n(c) Forming a closed circuit of the air gap between the high\nand low voltage windings.\n(d) Forming a closed circuit of the transformer’s tank.\nThe magnetic line of leakage will be bent at both ends of\nthe winding, resulting in leakage of magnetic ﬂux at both\nends of the winding with axial and radial components. When\na short-circuit or fault reclosing, short-circuit current or exci-\ntation inrush and spoke leakage component of the common\nrole of production into axial and radial electromagnetic force,\nthe huge electromagnetic force will destroy the structure of\nthe winding as well as insulation, serious cases may make the\ntransformer collapse.\nAnalysis of electromagnetic phenomena by solving\nMaxwell’s system of equations under a given set of boundary\nVOLUME 9, 2021 73337\nC.

ANALYSIS AND CALCULATION OF WINDING\nELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE\nThe interaction between the current and the leakage ﬁeld\ngenerates electromagnetic forces, and the magnitude of the\nelectromagnetic forces is proportional to the square of the cur-\nrent so that the generation of short-circuit current or excitation\ninrush current will generate a huge electromagnetic force on\nthe transformer winding. When the electromagnetic force is\ngreater than the winding can withstand the limit, transformer\ndamage will occur.\nThe electromagnetic force generated by the transformer\nwindings is shown in equation (10).\n⃗F =⃗J ×⃗B (10)\nwhere: J is the current density, A/m2; B is the leakage mag-\nnetic density, T .\nThe magnitude of the electromagnetic force is related to\nthe axial and radial components of the leakage magnetic ﬁeld,\nrespectively. The radial and axial electromagnetic forces are\ngenerated under the action of the axial and radial leakage\nmagnetic ﬁelds, respectively, as shown in equation (11).\n{\nFr =Bz ×J8\nFz =Br ×J8\n(11)\nwhere: Fz is the axial electromagnetic force, N; Fr is the\nradial electromagnetic force, N; Bz is the axial leakage den-\nsity, T ; Br is the radial leakage density, T .\nThe diagram below shows the irradiation force due to\nexcitation inrush and short circuit currents.\nThe short-circuit current affects both the inner and outer\nwindings, while the inner winding is also subject to the sup-\nport forces of the core, while the excitation inrush generated\nby energizing the transformer usually only affects the outer\nwinding.\nFIGURE 3. The radial force of winding under excitation inrush and\nshort-circuit current.\nThe axially averaged magnetic density Br can be expressed\nas.\nBz =µoH =µo\nId max ·W\n2H\n=0.4πId max ·W ρ\n2HK\n×10−6 (12)\nwhere: ρis the Lowe’s coefﬁcient; H is the actual height of\nthe winding, m; HK is the height of the winding reactance, m;\nIdmax is the maximum short-circuit current amplitude, A; W\nis the number of rated turns.\nSo, the radial force can be expressed as:\nFr =0.4πI2\nd max ·W 2ρDpj\n2HK\n×10−6 (13)\nFor concentric windings, the radial shear force is:\nσx = Fx\nW ·S = Fx\n2πWAx\n(14)\nwhere: Ax is the cross-sectional area of each turn of wire.\nThe direction of the axial force generated by the short-\ncircuit current and the excitation inrush is the same, i.e. both\ncompress the windings. The difference is that in the case\nof a short circuit, both the inner and outer windings are\nsubjected to compression forces, while the electromagnetic\nforces generated by the excitation inrush only affect the outer\n73338 VOLUME 9, 2021\nC.

Figure 4 shows a diagram of the axial force on the\nwinding.\nThe axial force at the ends of the transformer winding is\ndirected towards the middle of the winding. Under the same\nconditions, the magnetic ﬂux generated at the moment of\nreclosing the transformer is higher than that generated by the\nshort-circuit current, therefore, the axial force generated by\nthe excitation inrush is also higher than that generated by the\nshort-circuit current.\nThe radial leakage density Br can be expressed as.\nBr =0.4πId max ·W ρs\n2λ×108\nm−n∑\n1\n(am +am−1)Wm (15)\nwhere λ is the radial leakage width; ρs is the rock well\ncoefﬁcient of radial leakage; am is the maximum unbalanced\nampere-turn percentage.\nThe axial electromagnetic force can be expressed as.\nFz = 8.04\nλ×1011 ×K2\nchK2\nI (IN W )2Rpjρs\nm−n∑\n1\n[\n(am +am−1)Cpm\n]\n(16)\nwhere Cpm is the percentage of regional turns.\nTABLE 1.

MODELING AND SIMULATION ANALYSIS\nA. TRANSFORMER MODEL BUILDING AND RELATED\nPARAMETERS SETTING\nA 66.7KVA single-phase double-winding transformer is used\nto analyze its magnetic leakage, electromagnetic force, and\nwinding deformation. The main parameters of the trans-\nformer are shown in Table 1.\nThe transformer model’s main structural parameters are\nshown in Table 2.\nB. TRANSIENT SIMULATION OF WINDING\nELECTROMAGNETIC CHARACTERISTICS UNDER THE\nINFLUENCE OF EXCITATION CURRENTS\n1) TRANSIENT SIMULATION OF WINDING\nELECTROMA-GNETIC FORCE UNDER THE EXCITATION\nINRUSH\nWhen the transformer is closed at no load, the excitation\ninrush current reaches a maximum. The maximum excitation\ninrush current is reached when the transformer is closed with\nno load. With a residual ﬂux of 0.8 φm and a closing phase\nangle of 0 o or 180o. Figure 5 shows the variation curve of the\ntransformer air gap leakage ﬁeld.\nThrough the transformer winding air gap leakage magnetic\nﬁeld distribution curve can be seen, the air gap between each\npoint of the leakage magnetic change trends are generally\nconsistent, low-voltage winding and core between the air\ngap leakage magnetic density are smaller than the high and\nlow-voltage winding air gap between the leakage magnetic\ndegree. Between the low-voltage winding and the iron core,\nVOLUME 9, 2021 73339\nC. Zhanget al.: Comprehensive Analysis of Winding Electromagnetic Force and Deformation\nFIGURE 5. Air gap leakage field distribution.\nthe leakage magnetic density of both ends of the winding is\nthe largest, with a maximum of 39.6mT, and the minimum\nmagnetic density in the middle is close to zero. Between the\nhigh voltage winding and the low voltage winding, the mag-\nnetic density at both ends of the winding is a maximum\nof 40 mT. As the electromagnetic force is interacted by the\nexcitation current and the leakage magnetic ﬁeld, the distri-\nbution of the electromagnetic force and the leakage magnetic\nﬁeld remains essentially consistent.\nFigure 6 shows the volumetric force density cloud of the\nwinding forces caused by the excitation inrush.\nAs can be seen from the diagram, the electromagnetic\nforces at the ends of the winding are greater than those in\nthe middle, with a maximum value of 203 960 N/m3.\nFigure 7 shows the stress and displacement clouds of the\nwindings.\nFrom the ﬁgure can be obtained, in the action of the\nexcitation current, the central winding by electromagnetic\nforce is greater than the two ends, the maximum value\nreached 10621Pa, winding the upper end of the most serious\nwinding deformation, the maximum winding deformation for\n6.3511 ×10−6mm.\n2) TRANSIENT SIMULATION OF WINDING\nELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE UNDER SHORT-CIRCUIT\nCURRENT CONDITION\nAt the short-circuit occurrence of about 0.01s [7],\nthe short-circuit current will reach the peak of the ﬁrst wave,\nthe maximum short-circuit current is 2050A, selected and the\nprevious section of the same location to measure the leakage\nof magnetic density curve as shown in Figure 8.\nCompared to the leakage ﬁeld generated by the excitation\ninrush current, the leakage ﬁeld generated by the short-circuit\ncurrent is larger, and the variation is somewhat larger, and\nFIGURE 6.

Compared to\nthe electromagnetic force density under excitation inrush,\nthe maximum electromagnetic force density generated by the\nshort-circuit current is slightly larger, with a maximum value\nof 194119N /m3.\nFigure 10 shows the stress cloud and displacement cloud\nof the high voltage winding under short circuit current condi-\ntion.\nAs can be seen from the diagram, under the impact of the\nshort-circuit current, the maximum force on the high-voltage\nwinding, the maximum deformation variables are at both\nends, the maximum force value of 10324Pa.\n3) TRANSIENT SIMULATION ANALYSIS OF WINDING\nELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF\nEXCITATION CURRENT\nThis paper mainly simulates and analyses the magnitude and\ndirection of the electromagnetic force generated in the trans-\nformer winding by no-load and short-circuit excitation. The\nabove simulation results lead to the values of the parameters\naffecting the winding in the case of short-circuit and no-load\nreclosing in Table 3 and the results of the comparison of the\ntwo.\nFrom the above table, the peak excitation inrush current\nis only 73.55% of the peak short-circuit current, the elec-\ntromagnetic force generated by the two on the high-voltage\nwinding is almost equal, and the ratio of the two is 1.0507;\nthe variation law of the leakage magnetism and the variation\nlaw of the excitation current are relatively close.\nThrough simulation analysis, it can be demonstrated that\n(a) In the case where the peak excitation inrush current is\nonly 70% of the peak short-circuit current, the magnitude of\nthe electromagnetic force generated by the excitation inrush\nFIGURE 10. Winding stress and displacement cloud map of the high\nvoltage winding under the influence of short circuit current.\nTABLE 3. Effect of short circuit and reclosing on winding parameters.\ncurrent is approximately equal to the magnitude of the elec-\ntromagnetic force generated by the short-circuit current.\n(b) The two are again very different when analyzed from\nthe point of view of the magnetization of the core as well as\nthe magnetic ﬁeld. When a short circuit occurs in a trans-\nformer, high currents are generated in both the high voltage\nand low voltage windings, whereas the excitation inrush cur-\nrent generated during no-load closing is only present on the\nhigh voltage winding side, a no-load condition.\n(c) When the excitation amplitude is the same, the overall\nimpact of the excitation inrush on the winding is slightly\nless than the impact of the short-circuit current, but in local\nlocations, the magnetic ﬁeld and electromagnetic force of\nthe excitation inrush are greater than the impact of the\nshort-circuit current.\nC. ANALYSIS OF WINDING DEFORMATION VARIABLES\nUNDER INRUSH CURRENT\nThe effects of excitation inrush current and short-circuit cur-\nrent on the transformer winding are not identical. To show the\neffect of both conditions on the windings clearly, a compar-\native analysis of the winding deformation variables through\nthe X, Y, Z axis is presented below.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 73341\nC.

Deformation of the winding in three directions under\nshort-circuit current.\nFigure 11 shows the deformation of the winding in the X\nand Y-axis directions under the effect of the excitation inrush\nin the middle of the winding, and the deformation in the\nZ-axis direction is greater than the deformation in the other\ntwo directions.\nFigure 12 shows the deformation of the high voltage wind-\ning along with the three directions under the inﬂuence of\nthe short circuit current. Similar to the excitation inrush,\nthe deformation of the winding under short-circuit current is\nmainly in the Z-axis direction, but the deformation caused\nby the short-circuit current to the winding is more uniform\ncompared to the excitation inrush.\nExcitation inrush current and short-circuit current on the\ntransformer winding produced by the impact is not identi-\ncal, to more clearly show the impact of both on the wind-\ning, the following will be through the X, Y, Z-axis three\ndirectional comparative analysis of the winding deformation.\nTable 4 shows the short-circuit current and excitation inrush\ncurrent under the effect of winding deformation of compara-\ntive analysis.\nAs can be seen from the above table, the Z-axis direc-\ntion of the excitation inrush current on the winding has\na greater impact on the winding, the maximum winding\ndeformation is about 1.11 times the short-circuit current\ncondition, the average deformation is about 1.23 times the\nshort-circuit current. In the role of the excitation inrush\ncurrent, X-axis and Y-axis winding deformation variables\nTABLE 4. Effect of short circuit and inrush current on winding parameters.\nTABLE 5.

X-axis direction maximum deformation vari-\nable is about 0.86 times the short-circuit current condition,\nthe average deformation variable is about 0.63 times the\nshort-circuit current. Y-axis direction maximum deformation\nvariable and the short-circuit current deformation variable is\nequal, the average deformation variable is about 0.72 times\nthe short-circuit current condition.\nThe winding deformation curves in Figure 13 enable a\ncomparative analysis of the difference between the elec-\ntromagnetic forces generated by short-circuit current and\nexcitation inrush on the transformer winding. In the Z-axis\ndirection, the inﬂuence of the inrush current on the wind-\ning deformation is somewhat greater, the maximum wind-\ning deformation being approximately 1.11 times that of the\nshort-circuit current. However, in both the X- and Y-axis\ndirections, the winding deformation is slightly lower than the\nwinding deformation under short-circuit current condition.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\nBy comparing the results of the simulation analysis in the\nprevious section, the impact of the excitation inrush on the\ntransformer winding can be determined. To further verify\nthe accuracy of the simulation analysis results, experiments\non the effect of excitation inrush current on the winding\nare conducted.

Figure 14 shows the\ntransformer high-voltage winding volume force density under\nexcitation inrush.\nSince the leakage in the middle of the high voltage winding\nis smaller under the effect of excitation inrush, the electro-\nmagnetic force in the middle of the winding is smaller com-\npared to the two ends. Compared to the electromagnetic force\nFIGURE 15. High-voltage winding stress and displacement cloud\ndistribution.\nFIGURE 16. The experimental measurement site.\ndensity under short-circuit current, the maximum electro-\nmagnetic force density generated by the excitation inrush is\nslightly larger, with a maximum value of up to1.96 10 6N/m3.\nFigure 15 shows the stress cloud and displacement cloud\ndistribution of the high-voltage winding.\nAs can be seen from Figure 15, the maximum value of\nthe electromagnetic force on the high-voltage winding under\nthe action of the excitation inrush can reach 1.329 104KPa,\nmaximum shape variation up to 6.645 10 −2mm.\nTo verify the simulation results, an experimental platform\nis built. During the experiment, the PC sends the phase angle\nsetting value to the main control chip on the control board\nthrough serial communication. After the forward AC voltage\ncrosses zero, the trigger angle of the forward thyristor is\ncontrolled to generate a different phase signal, and the reverse\nthyristor voltage crosses zero to trigger the renewal, while\nthe AC contactor is turned on to keep the circuit connected.\nWhen the system is stabilized, the set value is sent to the\nmaster chip through the host computer to control the exci-\ntation loading values to form different remanences. Using\nWave Recorder DL850 for current and voltage signal record-\ning and storage, and oscilloscope TEK DPO3054 to display\nvoltage and current signals, the multi-pass data acquisition\nfunction is used to collect circuit voltage signals throughout\nthe experimental process. Furthermore, the test process uses\nthe laser doppler micrometer LV-S01 to measure the winding\ndeformation displacement under the inﬂuences of different\nremnant magnetism of the surge.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 73343\nC.

CONCLUSION\nThe electromechanical stress characteristics generated by\nthe excitation inrush current and the short-circuit current in\nthe transformer windings are different. The electromagnetic\nforces generated by short-circuit currents have an impact on\nboth the high and low voltage windings of the transformer,\nwhereas the electromagnetic forces generated by the excita-\ntion inrush only act on one side of the high voltage winding.\nAs the excitation inrush causes the transformer core to be\noversaturated and the permeability to be reduced, the compo-\nnent generated by the leakage ﬂux can be ignored. Therefore,\nwhen analyzing the transformer windings under the excitation\ninrush, the ﬁeld component generated by the current in the\nhigh voltage winding is generally only considered.\nAs the duration of the excitation inrush is signiﬁcantly\nhigher than the short-circuit current, even if the peak of\nthe excitation inrush is 30% lower than the peak of the\nshort-circuit current, the magnitude of the electromagnetic\nforce generated by the two conditions is essentially the same,\nand compared with the operation of the short-circuit current,\nthe excitation inrush will produce greater displacement in the\nwinding, so the danger to the transformer of the excitation\ninrush cannot be ignored.\nThe magnetic lines of force are bent at the ends of the wind-\nings and have their greatest value. The leakage in the core\nwindow is greater than outside the window due to the inﬂu-\nence of the yoke etc. The leakage caused by different faults\nis different and the path of the leakage ﬂux is also different.\nThe leakage from an excitation inrush is slightly greater than\nthat from a short circuit, resulting in a somewhat greater\nelectromagnetic force.\nIn addition, when a short circuit occurs, the protection\ndevice will act quickly and the fault can be cleared within a\nfew tens of milliseconds, but the excitation inrush not only\nlasts for a long time and occurs with high frequency, but\noften the system does not consider it to be a fault. As the\noccurrence of excitation inrush is not considered a fault,\nthe frequency of excitation inrush is much higher than the\nfrequency of short-circuit currents. Many power transform-\ners under no-load conditions frequently energized insulation\ndamage accidents have also shown that the impact of excita-\ntion inrush current is not weaker than short-circuit current or\neven greater than the impact of short-circuit current.\nTherefore, through this paper on the power transformer\nwinding in the excitation inrush current and short-circuit\ncurrent excitation under the simulation results of the compre-\nhensive comparison, clear the two on the power transformer\nelectromechanical performance of the impact; at the same\ntime, in the short-circuit current and excitation inrush current\nin the same amplitude or excitation inrush current amplitude\nslightly lower, analysis of its impact on the same side of the\nwinding, can better determine the cause of winding deforma-\ntion, to take the corresponding preventive and control mea-\nsures, effectively extend the operating efﬁciency and service\nlife of power transformers. Effectively extend the operating\nefﬁciency and service life of power transformers.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. Lan, Z.-P. Hu, F.-W. Liao, and Y.-B.
