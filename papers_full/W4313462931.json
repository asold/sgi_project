  "abstract": "A running transformer frequently experiences interturn faults; they are typically difficult to detect in their early stages but eventually progress to interturn short circuits, which cause damage to the transformer. Therefore, finding out the fault mechanism of the full interturn fault process can provide a theoretical basis for transformer fault detection. In this paper, an electromagnetic-solid mechanics coupled finite element model consistent with an actual oil-immersed three-phase transformer is established. The transient process of winding from interturn discharge to interturn short circuit is simulated to study the electromagnetic characteristics as well as the mechanical characteristics during transformer failure. The model parameters of the transformer are simulated to obtain the fault current, electromagnetic parameters and other performance parameters to study the characteristics of the magnetic field and coil force when interturn faults occur. Finally, the vibration of the transformer casing is used to detect as well as diagnose the transformer fault situation, providing a theoretical basis for the study of transformer detection and diagnosis capability improvement measures.",
