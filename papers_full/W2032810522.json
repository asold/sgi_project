Post  abortion counseling is introduced by using\nproper communication skills an d with using appropriate methods to women. In this study we\nintroduced contraceptive usage of women who ha d induced abortion one year ago and followed\nby DTFPA's clinic.\nResults: 55.3% of our clients were not using contraceptive methods before abortion. At the end\nof the one year, 75.9% of our followed-up clients revealed that they were using one of the modern\ncontraceptive methods. There wa s no woman with IUD before induced abortion. At the end of\none year 124 (52.3%) women had IUD. \"A modern  method was introduced immediately after\nabortion\" was the most important factor increasing modern method usage.\nConclusion: Our results advocate that post-abortion counseling may be an effective tool to\nincrease the usage of contraceptives. Improved and more qualified post-a bortion family planning\ncounseling should be an integral part of abortion services.\nBackground\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that,\nworldwide, almost 20 million unsafe abortions take place\neach year, with 95% of these performed in developing\ncountries. About 80,000 maternal deaths per year are\nthought to be due to abortion complications, accounting\nfor about 13% of all maternal deaths in the world, one in\neight pregnancy-related deaths [1]. An estimated 123 mil-\nlion couples, mainly in developing countries, do not use\ncontraceptives, despite wanting to space or limit their\nchildbearing [2]. Post-abortion counseling incorporated\ninto post abortion care has been regarded as an appropri-\nate venue or vehicle to decrease unwanted pregnancies\nand induced abortions [3].\nAbortion services have been readily available in Turkey\nsince 1983, when it was first legalized. According to the\nfamily planning law (1983), induced abortions can be\nperformed to pregnancies not exceeding 10 weeks. In Tur-\nkey, 12.4% of the women have had at least one induced\nPublished: 15 January 2009\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:20 doi:10.1186/1471-2458-9-20\nReceived: 28 February 2008\nAccepted: 15 January 2009\nThis article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/20\n© 2009 Ceylan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:20 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/20\nPage 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nabortion [4]. Most of the public hospitals and maternal\nhealth clinics perform abortion; however, these services\nare mainly provided without sufficient family planning\ncounseling. Turkish National Health Survey (TNHS)\nreported that 42.5% of the women have used a modern\ncontraceptive method while 28.5% of them have used tra-\nditional methods, and 40% of the women had unmet\nfamily planning need [5].\nOur study was conducted in Diyarbakir, which is consid-\nered to be an underdeveloped province in Turkey. The\navailability of health facilities and the utilization of family\nplanning are low in the province [6]. In this city, only\n28.1% of the women have used one of the modern con-\ntraceptive methods and most of the women had no\nchance to reach the abortion services [7,8]. The Diyarbakir\nOffice of Turkish Family Planning Association is one of a\norganization which introduce induced abortion services\nin slums of Diyarbakir.\nThe Diyarbakir Office of Turkish Family Planning Associ-\nation (DTFPA) is a nonprofit and nongovernmental\norganization which runs a family planning clinic to serve\nthe lower socio-economic populations, in Diyarbakir and\nall health services are free of charge. In our clinic, the\nnurses and physicians work voluntarily and were trained\nin counseling methods by professional trainers from the\nDicle University. Post abortion family planning coun-\nseling was provided to all clients attending our clinic for\nmedical abortion.\nIn this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of post abor-\ntion family planning counseling on contraceptive usage.\nBeside this we tried to answer the question of why the\nwomen did not use contraceptive methods although they\nhad life training induced abortion.\nMethods\nSubjects\nThe records of 322 women who underwent induced abor-\ntion and who had been provided post-abortion coun-\nseling between May 2003 and April 2004 were the main\nsource of this study. One year after the abortion date\nwomen were invited to clinic by telephone call or periodic\nhome visits. But only 237 women could be reached, fol-\nlowed and interviewed. Sixty two women could not be\nreached, and 23 women reluctant to participate in the\nstudy. Interviews were carried out with emphasis on the\nage of women, marital status, education level, attitudes\nand practices towards contraception.\nThe study carried out in compliance with the Helsinki\nDeclaration. Only women who gave informed verbal con-\nsent were included in the study. The Investigators were\naware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for\nresearch on human subjects in Turkey as well as applica-\nble international requirements. We obeyed the Turkish\nlegal rules for performing induced abortion.\nStudy Setting\nThe study conducted in Diyarbakir which is a city in the\nleast developed region of Turkey. Illiteracy rate in women\nwas 44% in Diyarbakir [9]. DTFPA's clinic was settled in\nsuburban area of Diyarbakir so the situation women were\nworse.\nIntervention and training of health staff\nIn accordance with the goal of our Association, appropri-\nate post abortion family planning counseling has been\nprovided to all of our clients. Post abortion counseling\nincluded proper communication skills of our providers\nand application of principles in adults learning. The prin-\nciples that we tried to apply were that adults learn easier if\nthe subject is relevant to their interest and previous expe-\nriences, if their feelings and attitudes are identified, and if\nthey are actively involved in the learning process. Various\nkinds of teaching techniques were used [10]. Three physi-\ncians and seven nurses were trained on adult training\nprinciples by a trainer from Dicle University. Physicians\nand nurses were also trained on good interpersonal com-\nmunication skills, including the ability on effective ques-\ntioning, active listening, summarizing, paraphrasing\nclients' comments or problems, and adopting a non-judg-\nmental, helpful manner. The training session of physi-\ncians and nurses took two weeks (40 hours), in which,\nhalf of the lectures were based on practice.\nApplications\nCounseling was conducted in a private room, with suffi-\ncient time (20 to 45 minutes) and confidentiality\nassured. We tried to help our clients to understand their\nreproductive legal rights, to learn to reach their self deter-\nmined goals through well-informed choices. Informa-\ntion about modern contraceptive methods was given.\nCondoms, combined oral contraceptive pills and intra\nuterine device (IUD) were introduced by physicians and\nnurses of our clinic. We followed up our clients by tele-\nphone calls or by home visits to take information on\ntheir complains about the chosen contraceptive method.\nAfter the abortion, each woman visited in her home with\n6 months intervals, women that we couldn't find her at\nhome interviewed by telephone call. Trainers from Dicle\nUniversity also supervised physicians and nurses of\nDTFPA on the manner of proper counseling rules men-\ntioned above. If a woman decided to tubal ligation or\nother methods that were not available in our clinic, we\nreferred them to public maternal health clinics or to the\nUniversity Hospital.\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:20 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/20\nPage 3 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nStatistical Analysis\nThe information obtained was recorded and analyzed by\nusing EpiInfo 2000 (CDC, USA) computer program. We\ndicotomised modern contraceptive usage (yes or not). To\nshow the effect of proper counseling on contraception\nusage, adjusted odds ratios were calculated for age, educa-\ntion level, parity, and desire for future fertility. The odds\nratio and 95% CI for not using contraception were calcu-\nlated by using logistic regression analyses.\nResults\nDemographic and fertility features\nAge groups were similar in three different groups (p =\n0.164). Illiteracy rate was 51.9% (123 women) (Table 1),\n14.8% of the women (35 women) had one induced abor-\ntion and 11.8% (26 women) had more than one induced\nabortion. Most of the women (68.4%) were wanted to\nstop childbearing, and 31.6% of them were planning to\npostpone childbearing.\nContraceptive usage after abortion\nThe contraceptive usage ratios of 237 women who had\ninduced abortion at least a year ago are shown in Table 2.\nBefore induced abortion performed the total contracep-\ntion usage (modern methods + traditional methods) rate\nwas 44.7% and this rate increased to 80.1% at the end of\none year. 180 (75.9%) women were still using one of the\nmodern contraceptive methods. The modern method\nusage rate increased 62.0%. The major increasing was in\nIUD there was no woman with IUD before induced abor-\ntion. But now 124 (52.3%) women had IUD one year\nafter the induced abortion performed.\nFactor effecting contraceptive usage\nThe factors associated with contraceptive usage in women\nwho had induced abortion one year ago were shown in\nTable 3. Twenty four percent of the 237 women were not\nusing any contraceptive methods. There was no difference\namong age groups and education level groups regarding\nto contraceptive usage. According to univaried analyses\nnulliparous and primiparous women were more tends to\nnot using contraceptives. Future fertility plan and previ-\nous induced abortion had no effect on contraceptive\nusage. If a contraceptive method was introduced immedi-\nately after abortion contraceptive usage could be higher\nfollowing one year.\nIn Table 4 reasons determined by women for why they did\nnot use contraceptives were shown. Most of the women\nhad no answer for this manner and some of them believe\nthat they could not get pregnant.\nDiscussion\nAs declared at the 1994, International Conference on Pop-\nulation and Development in Cairo, the primary propose\nof the family planning programs should be to help\nTable 1: Descriptive features of 237 women according to the \nhealth center abortions, Diyarbakir-2004.\nVariables DTFPA\nn (%)\nAge (years)\n15–19 19 (8.0)\n20–24 55 (23.2)\n25–29 61 (25.7)\n30–39 63 (26.6)\n> 40 39 (16.5)\nEducation level\nIlliterate 123 (51.9)\nLiterate 20 (8.4)\nPrimary school 60 (25.3)\nSecondary school 29 (12.2)\nHigh school or more 5 (2.1)\nParity\nNulliparous 4 (1.7)\nPrimiparous 21 (8.9)\nPara 2–4 95 (40.1)\nPara 5–7 80 (33.8)\n> Para 8 37 (15.6)\nPrevious induced abortion\nNone 174 (73.4)\n1 35 (14.8)\n> 1 28 (11.8)\nFertility choices\nStop childbearing 162 (68.4)\nPostpone childbearing 75 (31.6)\nMarital status\nCurrently married 237 (100.0)\nTotal 237 (37.4)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:20 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/20\nPage 4 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwomen avoid unwanted pregnancies and achieve their\nfertility goals safely [11]. Every woman who decides to\nreceive abortion reflects unwanted pregnancy and shows\na failure in meeting the Cairo goals. To meet the Cairo\nchallenge, we need better family planning counseling and\nhigher quality family planning services. In accordance\nwith a study conducted in Turkey, the main reasons for\ninduced abortion are: being unable to afford raising a\nbaby, unwillingness to raise children, willingness to post-\npone childbearing, advanced maternal age, risk to fetal\nhealth, and risk to maternal health [12]. In our study, we\ntried to answer the question why women do not use con-\ntraception; instead, they receive abortion. In addition, we\ntried to support the conclusion that improved post abor-\ntion family planning counseling is an important argu-\nment of reducing unwanted pregnancies.\nThe study conducted in a small area of Diyarbakir and the\nregion was least developed setting so the results may not\nreflect the women living Diyarbakir. As this is a follow-up\nstudy 85 women couldn't be reached and this may lead selec-\ntion bias and may negatively effect the results of our study.\nAmong our clients, 51.9% of the women were illiterate\nand 73.4% of them underwent abortion for the first time.\nThe rate of women with parity over 4 was 49.4%. Age dis-\ntributions, education levels, and parity of our clients were\nnot very different from the result of Turkish National\nHealth Survey [4]. In our study group, 55.3% of the\nwomen did not use any contraceptive method although\nthe contraceptives are available in all primary health care\ncenters and maternity hospitals in Turkey. In Brazil, 61%\nof the women who had induced abortion did not use any\ncontraceptives and the women with higher education\nlevel, younger age, and unmarried status would tend to\nhave abortion [13]. In USA, women undergoing abortions\nwere likely to be young (i.e., age < 25 years), white, and\nunmarried; slightly more than one-half were having an\nabortion for the first time [14].\nAt the end of one year, 75,9% of the women followed by\nour clinic were using one of the modern contraceptive\nmethods. Contraceptive usage was increased 36.3% for\ntotal contraceptives and 62.0% for modern methods. This\ndifference seems to be caused by post-abortion coun-\nseling. The use of postabortion family planning signifi-\ncantly decreased the postabortion pregnancy rate. In\nTurkey similar to our study a post abortion family plan-\nning counselling programme was applied and he use of an\nIUD was the preferred immediate method of choice [15].\nTable 2: Distribution of currently used methods 12 months or more after induced abortion, in Diyarbakir, in 2004.\nContraceptive Methods Before After\nn (%) n (%)\nNone 131 (55.3) 45 (19.0)\nCoitus interrupts and other traditional methods 73 (30.8) 12 (5.1)\nTotal modern methods 33 (13.9) 180 (75.9)\nIUD - 124 (52.3)\nContraceptive pills 8 (3.4) 18 (7.6)\nCondom 25 (10.5) 27 (11.4)\nInjectables -2  ( 0 . 8 )\nTubal ligation -5  ( 2 . 1 )\nVasectomy -4  ( 1 . 7 )\nodds ratio for total contraception (95% CI) 0.19 (0.12–0.29) p = 0.000\nodds ratio for modern contraception (95% CI) 0.05 (0.13–0.25) p = 0.000\nrate increase for total contraception usage %36.3\nrate increase for modern contraception usage %62.0\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:20 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/20\nPage 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 3: Factors influencing contraceptive usage in women who had induced abortion, Diyarbakir-2004\nNW o m e n  n o t  u s i n g  \ncontraceptives (%)\np Crude odds ratios (95% C.I.)

In Turkey, all contra-\nceptive methods are available in the primary health care\ncenters and the governmental maternal hospitals includ-\ning the abortion units. In England, majority of the abor-\ntion units indicated that they provided contraceptive\nadvice but only 74% of the units provided written infor-\nmation and even fewer units were able to provide a fol-\nlow-up appointment within 2 weeks [17]. It was reported\nthat the quality of counseling was critical to improving\nacceptance of post abortion contraception [18]. In our\nstudy, we gave the post abortion counseling by an appro-\npriate method. All of our doctors and nurses were trained\non communication skills and adult learning principles for\ngiving more qualified counseling. Our clients were also\nfollowed by telephone call or home visits. Contraceptive\nmethods were introduced immediately after the abortions\nand we monitored our clients in the meantime. These are\nthe main factors in increased usage of contraceptives by\nour clients.\nIn public hospitals and maternity clinics, the physicians\nand nurses mentioned that they have never given coun-\nseling to their attendants because over crowding.\nAlthough the physicians believe in the benefit of post\nabortion family planning counseling, they have never had\nenough time to give counseling appropriately. In private\nclinics, gynecologists/obstetricians advised some contra-\nceptive methods to their patients but not with proper\ncommunication skills. Additionally, in our clinic the wait-\ning time of clients was also short. In Mexico, the doctors\nand nurses also agreed that the women should be well\ninformed about the post abortion contraception, but the\ndoctors and nurses commented not having enough time\nto support their clients in post abortion period and unmet\ncontraception need was found 53% in a Mexico study\n[19]. This ratio is about as high as it is in Turkey. By means\nof better family planning counseling, unmet contracep-\ntion need may also be reduced. Nevertheless 88.6% of our\nclients met their contraceptive need.\nThe contraceptive usage was reported to be affected by\nparity, particularly in Islamic faith [20]. Contraceptive\nusage was also affected with the education level [21,22].\nWe studied in specific group. Because of this we could not\nfind relation between education level and contraceptive\nusage and we also could not find relation between parity\nand contraceptive usage. But the introducing of contracep-\ntive methods immediately after induced abortion effected\ncontraceptive usage.\nThis study was a pilot study and we tried to show the effect\nof postabortion family planning counselling to health\nauthority of Diyarbakir city. Today most of the clinics per-\nforming abortion services was giving family planning\ncounselling in Diyarbakir. In the study we couldn't\nresearch the effect of male partners. this is one of an other\nweakness of our study.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, post abortion period is the right time to\nintroduce contraceptive advices because women are more\nready to receive massages. We also concluded that intro-\nducing some advices or methods is not sufficient; more\nqualified counseling techniques including proper com-\nmunication skills is required in post abortion period.\nAbbreviations\nDTFPA: Diyarbakir Office of Turkish Family Planning\nAssociation; IUD: Intra Uterine Device; FP: Family Plan-\nning; WHO: World Health Organization; TNHS: Turkish\nNational Health Survey.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAC designed the study, carried out the area work, partici-\npated in the data collection, contribute drafting manu-\nscript and entering the data to computer.
