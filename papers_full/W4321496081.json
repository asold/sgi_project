  "abstract": "Synthesized multimedia is an open concern that has received much too little attention in the scientific community. In recent years, generative models have been utilized in maneuvering deepfakes in medical imaging modalities. We investigate the synthesized generation and detection of dermoscopic skin lesion images by leveraging the conceptual aspects of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks and state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViT). The Derm-CGAN is architectured for the realistic generation of six different dermoscopic skin lesions. Analysis of the similarity between real and synthesized fakes revealed a high correlation. Further, several ViT variations were investigated to distinguish between actual and fake lesions. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 97.18% which has over 7% marginal gain over the second best-performing network. The trade-off of the proposed model compared to other networks, as well as a benchmark face dataset, was critically analyzed in terms of computational complexity. This technology is capable of harming laymen through medical misdiagnosis or insurance scams. Further research in this domain would be able to assist physicians and the general public in countering and resisting deepfake threats.",
