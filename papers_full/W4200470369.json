    "abstract": "The magnetizing inductance of the high-frequency transformer in the dual-active bridge (DAB) converter is usually assumed to be much larger than its leakage inductance, thereby the magnetizing current can be negligible. However, ignoring the magnetizing current will lead to an error in the DAB converter design process. This paper analyzes the operation and performance of the DAB converter for a general case in which the transformer magnetizing inductance is taken into consideration. The analysis shows that the magnetizing inductance impacts the soft-switching region, the power transfer capability, and the leakage inductor current. A simulation case study is provided to verify the analysis. A DAB converter prototype is built to experimentally validate the analysis as well.",
