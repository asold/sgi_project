    "abstract": "Abstract Transformers are essential equipment to the operation of electrical power systems, a failure causes the lack of electricity supply to end-users, affecting the operating indicators of companies in the distribution sector. The investigation presents an identification of the faults in transformers through a fishbone diagram, an evaluation of the variables that cause the identified failure using the cross-impact matrix method and a proposal to improve the performance. The results will enable a plan to be developed for taking action with monitoring plans to avoid faults that could put the electrical asset at risk and achieve a better performance of the distribution network.",
