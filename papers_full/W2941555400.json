INTRODUCTION\nA power transformer is one of the most important and expen-\nsive equipment in electric power transmission. Speciﬁcally,\nit considerably inﬂuences the reliability of the entire power\nnetwork. Mineral oil impregnated paper is used extensively in\ntransformers as an insulating medium. As the main electrical\ninsulation and heat-eliminating medium, mineral oil directly\ndetermines the safe operation of the power transformer. It is a\nmixture of alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons\nthat contains many impurities. Although large particles can\nbe removed by oil ﬁlter with high vacuum and high preci-\nsion, the remaining small impurities can agglomerate together\nto form large particles under a high electrical stress. Some\nimpurity particles can deposit on the surface of transformer\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Bora Onat.\ntank and parts in manufacturing and assembling. During the\noperation of transformers, these impurities may fall and mix\ninto the transformer oil due to the vibration of the power\ntransformer or the ﬂushing of oil ﬂow [1]. Other major\nsources of impurities are insulation aging and failures, such\nas partial overheating [2], partial discharge (PD) [3]–[5], and\nspark discharge. Metal particles and bubbles are two typi-\ncal impurities in transformer oil. As conductive impurities,\nmetal particles can be charged, which have a big threat to\ntransformer insulation. Bubbles can lead to PD due to the low\ndielectric strength of gas and the high electric ﬁeld in bubbles.\nTo study the damage of impurities to the insulation per-\nformance of transformer oil, numerous experiments have\nbeen conducted [6]–[8]. Bell and Trinh studied the inﬂu-\nence of impurities on the breakdown voltage of transformer\noil at the early stage. They discovered that impurities can\ndecrease the breakdown voltage, and the larger the impurity\n48098\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Zhanget al.: Comparison of PD and Breakdown Characteristics\nsize is, the more evident this effect will be [9], [10]. Pompili\nconducted PD experiments using a needle-to-plane electrode\nsystem and suggested that the ﬁrst PD may generate bub-\nbles or vapors and the following PD pulse bursts occurred in\nthese bubbles [11]. Moreover, bubble clusters can be gener-\nated by Joule heating under the application of pulsed voltage,\nwhich can ignite the streamer and then lead to direct ioniza-\ntion in liquid [12]. The size and position of bubbles can affect\nthe PD intensity, and PD tends to occur in large bubbles [13].\nConductive particles are generally the most dangerous impu-\nrities. Li focused on the PD characteristics of steel balls with\na radius of 1 mm in a quasi-uniform electric ﬁeld. The author\nfound that the motion of metal balls could be divided into\noscillating and jumping stages, which directly affected the\nPD behavior [14]. Sarathi focused on the PD induced by an\naluminum ball with a radius of 1.25 mm. The result showed\nthat the PD induced by large metal balls could excite ultrahigh\nfrequency (UHF) signals with frequency contents of 0.5 GHz\nto 1.2 GHz and 1 GHz to 3 GHz under AC and DC conditions,\nrespectively [15].\nPrevious studies have usually focused on one type of impu-\nrity, either bubbles or metal particles. However, comparing\ntheir discharge characteristics is difﬁcult due to differences in\ntest condition. The ambiguity of the discharge characteristics\nis not conducive for detecting the PD in the actual transformer\nnor for clarifying the breakdown mechanism of transformer\noil contaminated by impurities. Moreover, previous investi-\ngations have mostly focused on stationary transformer oil;\nhowever, the oil moves in a large running transformer due\nto various cooling systems. Therefore, studies on ﬂowing\ntransformer oil are important for engineering applications.\nOur research team recently investigated the effect of oil veloc-\nity on PD activities induced by bubbles and metal particles\n[16], [17]. We found remarkable differences between PD\nactivities in ﬂowing and stationary states. Particularly, PD\nactivities further become weak as oil velocity increases. This\nﬁnding is consistent with the research of Li et al.[18]. Hence,\nall experiments in the present paper were conducted on the\nbasis of ﬂowing transformer oil.\nIn the present work, we aim to clarify different charac-\nteristics of PD and breakdown induced by metal particles\nand bubbles in ﬂowing transformer oil. PD and breakdown\nexperiments were performed on an experimental platform\nof ﬂowing transformer oil. We adopted several methods to\nmeasure PD signals and obtained single PD waveforms and\nphase resolved PD (PRPD) patterns. Then, we summarized\nthe different effects of the two types of impurity on the insula-\ntion performance of transformer oil. Finally, we explained the\ndifferent discharge characteristics on the basis of the motions\nof impurities and electric ﬁeld analysis.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND METHOD\nA. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nTo perform PD and breakdown experiments, we established\nan experimental platform of ﬂowing transformer oil [17],\nas shown in Fig. 1. The main oil duct was composed of\nFIGURE 1. Circulation device of flowing transformer oil for PD and\nbreakdown experiments.\npolymethyl methacrylate, which is a transparent lightweight\ninsulation material. We designed two ﬂat plate electrodes\nwith a diameter of 200 mm and a thickness of 10 mm to\ncreate a uniform electric ﬁeld. The distance between the two\nelectrodes was 10 mm. A ﬂange above the main oil duct\nwas prepared for the changes of electrodes and impurities.\nWe used a net sieve with 3 mm openings to limit the diameter\nof bubbles below 3 mm. The temperature of the entire device\nwas controlled using a temperature sensor, thermoelectric\ncooler, and heating pipe. Oil circulation was achieved with an\noil pump. Generally, oil velocity is lower than 0.5 m/s in the\nactual transformer, and most transformers operate in the range\nof 40 ◦C to 80 ◦C [19], [20]. Hence, all of the experiments\nwere conducted at a velocity of 0.30 m/s in the main oil duct\nand temperature of 60 ◦C.\nB. MEASUREMENT METHOD\nWe used several methods in detecting PD signals to investi-\ngate fully the differences between PDs induced by bubbles\nand metal particles. First, a noninductive resistor was uti-\nlized to obtain the PD current pulses, which were closer to\nthe real discharge current waveforms. Second, two types of\nantenna were used to measure the electromagnetic radiation\nof PD due to their wide application in online monitoring. One\ntype was a microstrip patch antenna with a center frequency\nof 390 MHz and a bandwidth of 340 MHz to 440 MHz\n(UHF antenna), which has been applied to online monitor-\ning. The other type was a sleeve monopole antenna with a\ncenter frequency of 100 MHz and a bandwidth of 20 MHz\nto 250 MHz (very high frequency (VHF) antenna). Although\nthe two antennas do not cover all frequency bands of VHF and\nUHF, they can effectively reveal the differences in the electro-\nmagnetic radiation signals of PD induced by metal particles\nand bubbles. However, the antenna method cannot completely\ndetermine the amount of charge. Hence, the conventional\nmeasurement method recommended by IEC 60270 was also\nadopted [21]. The PD waveform obtained by the conven-\ntional method is completely different from the real discharge\nVOLUME 7, 2019 48099\nY. Zhanget al.: Comparison of PD and Breakdown Characteristics\nFIGURE 2. Experimental circuit and measurement system.\ncurrent waveforms. Thus, this method was only used to deter-\nmine the amount of charge and repetition rate. Fig. 2 shows\nthe experimental measurement system. The circulation device\nCx was placed in a shielding room. R1 was a protec-\ntion resistor. The measuring circuit recommended by IEC\n60270 comprised an impedance detector Zm and a coupling\ncapacitor Ck. PD signals detected by Zm were set as the trigger\nsignals for oscilloscope (DPO 7104). A transient voltage\nsuppressor (TVS), which was connected in parallel to a 50 \nnoninductive resistor R, could protect the oscilloscope from\noverloading when a breakdown occurred accidentally. The\nsignals measured by the antenna (VHF or UHF), the non-\ninductive resistor R, the impedance detector Zm, and the\ncapacity voltage divider Cd were synchronously inputted into\nthe oscilloscope.\nBefore test, the mineral oil (Karamay No. 25) was ﬁltered\nto remove impurities larger than 5 µm in diameter. Then, the\noil was carefully dried and degassed with a vacuum degassing\nand dehydration system. The breakdown voltage of the pro-\ncessed transformer oil was 75 kV according to the procedure\nand the cell-container described in IEC 60156 [22], which\nreached the engineering application requirements. To avoid\nthe PD disturbances from high-voltage lines, the maximum\nof the allowable applied voltage of the following PD tests was\nmeasured. The oil duct was ﬁlled with processed oil (without\nany artiﬁcial insulation defect). PD disturbances occurred\nwhen the voltage rose to 35 kV . Hence, if the applied voltage\nof following PD experiments was below 35 kV , the exper-\niment results were free of disturbances from high-voltage\nlines.\nIn an actual transformer oil, the diameter of metal particles\nranges from 5 µm to 200 µm [7]. Large particles generally\ncause more serious harm to oil insulation than smaller ones;\nthus, the diameter of particles was set to 150 µm. The con-\ncentration of metal particles was set to 1.0 g/L [23]. In the\nbubble experiments, 250 mL dry air was injected into the\noil duct through the air scoop. The air mass was broken into\nsmall bubbles by the oil pump, and the net sieve controlled\nthe diameter of bubbles below 3 mm [24].\nIII. MOTIONS OF IMPURITIES\nSmall metal particles and bubbles can move with oil ﬂow\nin an actual transformer. Their motions can affect the\ncharacteristics of PD and breakdown [25]. We used a camera\nto capture the motions of bubbles. However, it is quite difﬁ-\ncult to capture the motions of metal particles because the size\nof particles is greatly smaller than that of the oil duct. Thus,\nwe constructed a physical mode involving multiple forces to\nsimulate the motions of metal particles.\nA. MOTIONS OF BUBBLES\nThe motions of bubbles are dominated by buoyancy, oil drag\nforce, pressure gradient force, Maxwell stress tensor, and sur-\nface tension. The motions were recorded by a video camera\nthat was operated at 120 frames s −1. Fig. 3 shows the motions\nof small and large bubbles at the applied voltage of 10 kV .\nFIGURE 3. Motions of bubbles with diameters of (a) 0.8 mm and\n(b) 2.0 mm.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, bubbles gradually approached the top\nelectrode while moving in the direction of oil ﬂow. The large\nbubble (diameter of 2.0 mm) reached the upper electrode at\nt =0.23 s, whereas the small bubble (diameter of 0.8 mm)\ndid not reached the upper electrode until t =0.74 s. Hence,\nthe large bubble was mainly distributed near the upper elec-\ntrode, and the small bubble was mainly distributed in the\noil bulk. Besides, the large bubble required longer time to\npass through the electrode than the small bubble did due to\nthe viscidity of liquid. The viscidity function slows the oil\nvelocity near the electrode, and the velocity in the central\nregion is the largest. Therefore, the velocity of the large\nbubble (near the electrodes) was low, whereas that of the\nsmall bubble (in the oil bulk) was high. The position and\nduration of bubbles in the high electric ﬁeld may further affect\nthe PD and breakdown characteristics.\nB. MOTIONS OF METAL PARTICLES\nAs conductive impurities, metal particles can be charged\nby contacting with electrodes; hence, the Coulomb force\nplays an important role in the movement of metal parti-\ncles. The motion equation of charged metal particles can be\n48100 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY. Zhanget al.: Comparison of PD and Breakdown Characteristics\nFIGURE 4.

Fother is considerably\nlower than Fdrag,Fe, and Fg; thus, it can be neglected [26].\nThe motion in the vertical direction of metal particles is\ndetermined by Fe and Fg. The direction of Fdrag is related to\nthe oil velocity and particle velocity. Hence, Fdrag can affect\nthe vertical and horizontal motions.\nF other =FS +FM +FP +FB +FVM (5)\nFig. 4 plots the trajectories of metal particles with a diam-\neter of 150 µm under an AC voltage of 10 kV and a velocity\nof 0.30 m/s. Metal particles moved back and forth between\nthe two electrodes while moving horizontally with the oil\nﬂow. The repeated collisions with two electrodes were similar\nto the report in [29]. The motion of metal particles was\ncompletely different from that of bubbles. The variations in\nconductivity, volume, and density of the two impurities result\nin the completely different motions that also have various\neffects on the insulating properties of the transformer oil.\nIV. RESULTS\nA. PD INCEPTION VOLTAGE\nWe continuously increased the applied voltage to the PD\noccurrence (PD ≥100 pC) at a rate of 1 kV/s to obtain\nthe partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) in accordance\nwith IEC 61294 [30]. The PDIV measurements were repeated\n10 times because PD has a stochastic nature in principle. The\naverage PDIVs of metal particles and bubbles in transformer\noil were 8.4 kV and 23.2 kV , respectively, as Fig. 5. The PDIV\nof bubbles was higher than that of metal particles. The test\nvoltage of PD experiments was set to 1.2 times the PDIV .\nHence, the applied voltages were set as 10.0 kV and 27.9 kV\nin the following PD tests of metal particles and bubbles,\nrespectively.\nFIGURE 5. The average PDIVs of metal particles and bubbles.\nFIGURE 6. (a) Electromagnetic radiation signals of metal particles and (b)\nFFT analysis.\nFIGURE 7.

Zhanget al.: Comparison of PD and Breakdown Characteristics\nTABLE 1. Characteristic parameters of current pulses (ns).\nbubbles were approximately 250 ns and 700 ns, respectively.\nThe frequency content of PD induced by metal particles was\nin the range of 300 MHz to 2.3 GHz (in the UHF range),\nwhereas that of bubble-induced PD was below 200 MHz\n(in the VHF range). Although the excitation mechanism of\nelectromagnetic signals is not completely clear at present,\nelectromagnetic signal is generally related to the short rise\ntime of current pulse [31]. Therefore, we further measured\nthe current pulses by a 50 noninductive resistor, which will\nbe discussed in the next section.\nFIGURE 8. Current pulses of metal particles measured by R: (a) positive,\n(b) negative.\nFIGURE 9. Current pulses of bubbles measured by R: (a) positive,\n(b) negative.\nC. PD CURRENT PULSES MEASURED BY\nNONINDUCTIVE RESISTOR\nFigs. 8 and 9 show the typical positive and negative current\npulses of metal particles and bubbles measured by R, respec-\ntively. We extracted 90% rise time tr, 90% fall time td, and\n50% amplitude pulse duration tw to quantitatively compare\nthe current pulses induced by the two impurities, which are\nalso illustrated in Fig. 9a. The average results of 100 PD\ncurrent pulses are shown in Table 1.\nThetr of the current pulse of metal particle-induced PD and\nof bubble-induced PD were only 3.1 ns and 25.1 ns, respec-\ntively. As shown in Table 1, the tr, td, and tw of metal particles\nwere shorter than those of bubbles. The durations of the PD\ncurrent pulses induced by metal particles and bubbles were\napproximately 150 ns and 250 ns, respectively. Moreover, the\noscillation of the current pulse of metal particles was consid-\nerably more severe than that of bubbles. The waveforms of\npositive and negative current pulse were similar, except for\nthe opposite polarity.\nFIGURE 10. PRPD patterns of metal particles: (a) ϕ–q, (b) ϕ–n.\nFIGURE 11. PRPD patterns of bubbles: (a) ϕ–q, (b) ϕ–n.\nD. PRPD PATTERNS\nThe distribution of bubbles and metal particles has strong\nrandomness, and PD signals have obvious randomness in\namplitude and phase. Thus, a single PD cannot represent the\nPD characteristics. We conducted continuous PD experiments\nfor 30 minutes to reveal the differences between PDs induced\nby the two impurities. The discharge phase ϕ, apparent charge\nq, and the number of PDs n were extracted on the basis of\nthe PD signals measured by the conventional method. The\namplitude of the PD occurring in the negative half-cycle is\nnegative. To clearly compare the magnitudes of PDs occur-\nring in the positive and negative half-cycles, the following\napparent charges were replaced by their absolute values. PD\nexperiments of each impurity were repeated ﬁve times. The\nresults of the ﬁve experiments were consistent. As such,\nthe experiments had good repeatability. Figs. 10 and 11\nshow the PRPD patterns of metal particles and bubbles,\nrespectively.\nWe observed remarkable differences in PRPD patterns of\nthe two impurities. For metal particles, PDs almost occupied\nthe entire power frequency cycle. The graphs of positive and\nnegative half-circles were similar. For bubble-induced PD, all\nthe discharges were distributed in the range of 60 ◦to 104 ◦\nand 236 ◦ to 305 ◦. The phase with the largest number of\nPDs was 270 ◦. Most PDs occurred in the negative half-\ncycle, and the polarity effect was evident. The comparison of\nFigs. 9 and 10 showed that although the apparent charge of PD\n48102 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY. Zhanget al.: Comparison of PD and Breakdown Characteristics\ninduced by metal particles was small, its frequency was high.\nBy contrast, although the apparent charge of bubble-induced\nPD was large, its frequency was low. To show the differ-\nences clearly, we further extracted statistical characteristics,\nnamely, the pulse repetition rate, average apparent charge,\nand accumulated apparent charge in unit time, which will be\ndiscussed in the next section.\nE. PD STATISTICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nThe number of PDs occurring in positive and negative\nhalf-cycles and the total number of PDs were recorded as\nN+, N−, and N, respectively. We deﬁned the unit time as\n1 minute. Thus, the number of PDs was converted to pulse\nrepetition rate in 1 minute. The results are shown in Table 2.\nThe pulse repetition rates N of metal particles and of bubbles\nwere 394.43 and 13.70 per minute, respectively. The pulse\nrepetition of metal particles was extremely higher than that of\nbubbles. No considerable difference was observed between\nthe N+and N−of PD induced by metal particles. How-\never, the N−of bubble-induced PD was greatly higher than\nthe N+.\nTABLE 2. Pulse repetition rate (per minute).\nAverage apparent charge is the ratio of the total PD appar-\nent charge to the number of PDs. The average apparent charge\nof PD that occurred in the positive half-cycle, negative half-\ncycle, and the total average apparent charge were recorded as\nQave+,Qave−, and Qave, respectively. The results are shown\nin Table 3.\nTABLE 3. Average apparent charge (pC).\nGiven the two preceding characteristic parameters, PD\ninduced by metal particles had high repetition rate, whereas\nbubble-induced PD had high apparent charge. In view of\nthe PD intensity, the repetition pulse only covers the PD\nfrequency; however, it lacks information on amplitude.\nMoreover, the average apparent charge lacks information\non frequency. Hence, the accumulated apparent charge in\nunit time (1 minute) was calculated. It contains frequency\nand amplitude information. The accumulated apparent charge\nwas recorded as Qacc, and Qacc+ and Qacc− for positive\nand negative half-cycles, respectively. The results are shown\nin Table 4. From the table, the accumulated apparent charge of\nTABLE 4. Accumulated apparent charge (pC).\nmetal particles was considerably higher than that of bubbles,\nand the PD intensity of metal particles was more severe than\nthat of bubbles.\nF. BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE\nBreakdown voltage is an important parameter that can evalu-\nate the effects of bubbles and metal particles on the insulation\nperformance of transformer oil. The experiment conditions\nwere the same as PD tests. The applied voltage was continu-\nously increased to breakdown at a rate of 2 kV/s. Breakdown\nexperiments were repeated 10 times. The average breakdown\nvoltage of the 10 experiments of ﬂowing transformer oil with\nmetal particles and bubbles were 42.0 kV and 31.6 kV , respec-\ntively. Their relative standard deviations were 4.5% and 6.2%,\nrespectively. The bubbles had a substantial inﬂuence on the\ndecrease in breakdown voltage.\nV. DISCUSSIONS\nA. PDIV\nThe PDIV of metal particles was considerably lower than\nthat of bubbles; thus, metal particles can easily cause PD.\nThis phenomenon may be related to the discharge mechanism\ndetermined by the nature of the two impurities.\nFIGURE 12. Motions of metal particles under different applied voltages.\n(a) 6 kV. (b) 8 kV. (c) 9 kV. (d) 10 kV.\nSarathi found that PD incepted when the spherical parti-\ncle jumped from one electrode to another [32]. The motion\nof metal particles was determined by the applied voltage.\nTherefore, the PDIV of metal particles could be estimated\non the basis of the particle movement. We simulated the\nmotions of the metal particles under different applied voltages\nusing the previous model. The results are shown in Fig. 12.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 48103\nY. Zhanget al.: Comparison of PD and Breakdown Characteristics\nWhen the applied voltage was 6 kV , the metal particle moved\nnear the ground electrode because of the limitation of alter-\nnating voltage, as Fig. 12a. The jumping height of the particle\nincreased with the applied voltage due to the increase of\nCoulomb force. When the applied voltage reached 10 kV ,\nthe charged metal particle regularly collided with the two\nelectrodes, which meant the PD inception. Therefore, the cal-\nculated PDIV of metal particles was 10 kV . The initial posi-\ntion of the metal particles was on the surface of the ground\nelectrode in this simulation. Some charged metal particles\nwere suspended in the transformer oil and could easily col-\nlide with the two electrodes, as shown in Fig. 4. Therefore,\nthe PDIV of metal particles should be lower than 10 kV .\nThe experimental measurement was 8.4 kV , which was in\nagreement with the simulations.\nThe PD induced by bubbles is the breakdown progress\nin bubbles. Therefore, we can estimate the PDIV of the\ntransformer oil containing bubbles based on the breakdown\nstrength of the bubble. Since the bubble diameter was lim-\nited to less than 3 mm and the electric ﬁeld in bubbles\nwas uniform, Paschen’s law is available here. The break-\ndown strength Eb of bubbles derived from Paschen’s law are\nexpressed as follows [33]:\nEb = Bp\nln(pd) +k , (6)\nwhere constant B is 2737.5 V/kPa ·cm, p is the pressure, d is\nthe diameter of bubbles, and k can be expressed as\nk =3.5134(pd)0.05999, (7)\nwhen pd is in the range of 0.2 to100 kPa ·cm. The change of\nEb with the bubble diameter can be obtained by (6) and (7),\nas Fig. 13. Fig. 13 shows that Eb declines with the increase\nof bubble diameter. On the other hand, the electric ﬁeld\nstrength inside the bubbles of different sizes is almost equal.\nTherefore, PD ﬁrst occurs in large bubbles. Hence, we only\nfocused on the Eb of the bubble with a diameter of 3 mm,\nwhich was as low as 35.81 kV/cm.\nFIGURE 13. Change of Eb with the bubble diameter.\nTo determine the applied voltage on the electrodes by\nthe Eb (35.81 kV/cm), we performed electrostatic ﬁeld sim-\nulation. The deformation of the bubble was ignored for\nsimplicity. As shown in Fig. 14, the electric ﬁeld in bubbles\nFIGURE 14. Electric field distribution in transformer oil containing a\nbubble with applied voltage of 1 kV and distance of 1 cm.\nwas 1.30 times that in transformer oil. Therefore, the peak\nvalue of the applied voltage between the two electrodes\nwas 27.55 kV . Accordingly, the calculated effective volt-\nage was 19.48 kV . The experimental PDIV was 23.2 kV ,\nwhich was larger than the calculation. The deviation may\narise from several reasons. First, the applied voltage was\nalternating, so PD may not occur until the electric ﬁeld in\nbubbles was higher than Eb for a period. Second, the effect\nof space charge was not considered, which resulted in the\nactual electric ﬁeld in bubbles being slightly lower than the\ncalculation. Then, the actual bubble size may be smaller than\n3 mm, which also enhanced the experimental PDIV .\nB. PD WAVEFORM\nElectromagnetic radiation signals measured by antennas and\ncurrent pulses measured by noninductive resistor showed\nobvious differences in PDs between the metal particles and\nbubbles. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, PD induced by metal\nparticles could excite UHF signals, whereas bubble-induced\nPD could only excite VHF signals. In accordance with the\nmeasurement of noninductive resistor, the rise time of the cur-\nrent pulse induced by metal particles and bubbles were 3.1 ns\nand 25.1 ns, respectively. Some researchers have proposed\nthat short PD current pulses had more spectral energy at high\nfrequencies [31]. Therefore, the short rise time of the current\npulse is responsible for the UHF PD signals induced by metal\nparticles. Hence, the measurements of current pulses are in\nagreement with the electromagnetic radiation signals. Next,\nwe explain the reasons for the differences between the rise\ntime of the two types of PD via theoretical calculation.\nThe rise time of current pulse corresponds to the prop-\nagation time of streamer [34], [35]. The propagation time\nof the streamer induced by metal particles is determined\nby the discharge gap and the propagation speed. Initially,\nwe calculated the discharge gap. Birlasekaran discovered\nthat microdischarges occur when the electric ﬁeld reaches\n70 MV/m [36].\nThe electric ﬁeld distortion changes with the distance\nbetween the metal particles and the electrode. Before calcu-\nlating the changes of electric ﬁeld with distance, we initially\ncalculated the amount of charge of metal particles. The metal\nparticles had the same potential with the electrode after col-\nliding with it [37]. Therefore, the amount of charge of the\n48104 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY. Zhanget al.: Comparison of PD and Breakdown Characteristics\nFIGURE 15. Surface charge density of the charged metal particle.\nFIGURE 16. Changes of the maximum electric field with the distances\nbetween the metal particles and the upper electrode.\nmetal particles could be obtained according to the potential.\nAn extreme case was considered, in which the potential of\nhigh voltage electrode was at peak value for simplicity. The\nsurface charge density of the metal particles with a diameter\nof 150 µm is shown in Fig. 15 under the applied voltage of\n10 ×\n√\n2 kV . The total charge of the metal ball equaled to 3.7\npC, which was calculated by integrating the surface charge\ndensity along the spherical surface. Birlasekaran also pro-\nposed a formula for calculating the charge of metal particles,\nas shown in (8) [27].\nq =2\n3π3r2\np εrε0E (8)\nIn accordance with (8), the charge q of metal particles was\n3.2 pC, which was nearly equal to the simulation result in the\npresent work, thereby proving the accuracy of the simulation.\nWe set the upper electrode as kV in the simulation model\nof electrostatic ﬁeld. The charges of metal particles were\nset as 3.7, −3.7, and 0 pC. Fig. 16 shows the changes of\nthe maximum electric ﬁeld with the distance between the\nmetal particles and the upper electrode. When the polari-\nties of metal particles and the electrode were opposite, the\ndistortion of electric ﬁeld was the most serious. For ground\nelectrodes, the inﬂuence of distance and polarity on electric\nﬁeld distortion were the same as that of the upper electrode.\nWe only considered the case of opposite polarity for sim-\nplicity. The closer the particle was to the electrode, the more\nsevere the electric ﬁeld distortion was. When the distance was\n2 µm, the maximum electric ﬁeld in oil reached 70 MV/m.\nTherefore, the discharge gap was approximately 2 µm. The\nnext step is to obtain the streamer velocity.\nWang et al. found that the velocity of a streamer was\napproximately 1.5 km/s by a high-speed video [38]. Thus,\nthe propagation time of the streamer induced by metal par-\nticles was 1.33 ns in accordance with the discharge gap and\nthe velocity. The theoretical result was slightly less than the\nexperimental measurement. This deviation may be caused\nby the response delay of the measure system. The short\ncurrent pulses induced by metal particles that occurred in the\ntransformer oil excited the UHF PD signals.\nThe PD induced by bubbles occurs in bubbles. Therefore,\nthe propagation time of streamer was determined by the size\nof the bubbles and the propagation speed of the streamer in the\nair. Fig. 13 shows that PD tends to occur in large bubbles. The\nbubble diameter was limited to less than 3 mm in the present\nword. Briels et al.found that the average speed of the streamer\nwas approximately 0.123 mm/ns [39]. Thus, the propagation\ntime of the streamer induced by bubbles was 24.39 ns, which\nis close to the measurement. The rise time of current pulses\nwas slow. Hence, PD induced by bubbles only excited VHF\nsignals.\nUHF antennas have been used for online monitoring of\npower transformers. However, this technology cannot ﬁnd\nPD induced by bubbles, as veriﬁed by the experiments. The\npresence of bubbles easily resulted in the breakdown of the\ncomplete oil gap. Therefore, monitoring of bubbles should\nbe further studied.\nC. PRPD PATTERNS\nThe phase distribution of metal particle-induced PD nearly\ncovered the entire power frequency cycle, and the PRPD\npatterns in the positive and the negative half-cycles were\nsymmetrical. The wide phase distribution of metal particle-\ninduced PD may be due to the randomness of colli-\nsions. As shown in Fig. 4, the initial positions could\naffect the particle trajectories, thereby further changing the\nPD phase.\nIn comparison with the PD induced by metal particles,\nthe phase distribution of bubble-induced PD was relatively\nnarrow. As previously mentioned, bubble-induced PD is the\nbreakdown of bubbles. PD would not occur until the electric\nﬁeld in bubbles exceeds Eb. In the PD experiments of bubbles,\nthe applied voltage was 27.9 kV . Thus, the phases exceeding\nthe Eb of bubbles with a diameter of 3 mm (35.81 kV/cm)\nwere in the range of 65 ◦ to 115 ◦ and 245 ◦ to 295 ◦. The\nexperiment measurement was in the range of 60 ◦ to 104 ◦\nand 236◦to 305◦. Therefore, the calculations agree with the\nmeasurements. Besides, the narrow phase distribution may be\nresponsible for the low pulse repetition rate of bubbles.\nAnother considerable difference was the ϕ–n pattern\nbetween the two types of PD. The ϕ–n patterns of metal\nparticles were symmetrical, whereas those of bubble-induced\nPD were concentrated in the negative half-cycle. PD occurs\nwhen metal particles collide with the opposite electrode.\nTherefore, we counted the number of collisions in the positive\nVOLUME 7, 2019 48105\nY. Zhanget al.: Comparison of PD and Breakdown Characteristics\nand negative half-cycles in Fig. 4, which were 43 and 44,\nrespectively. Hence, the ϕ–n patterns of metal particles were\nsymmetrical, and the numbers of PDs in the negative and pos-\nitive half-cycles were almost equal. Frequent collisions were\nalso responsible for the high repetition rate of PD induced\nby metal particles. Then, the high repetition rate led to the\nhigh accumulated apparent charge of metal particles shown\nin Table 4.\nFIGURE 17. Different types of bubble: (a) isolated bubble; (b) boundary\nbubble.\nThe polarity effect of bubble-induced PD may be related\nto the sources of seed electrons, which associate with the\nlocation of the bubbles. The motions of bubbles (Fig. 3)\nindicated that bubbles either existed in the oil bulk (deﬁned\nas isolated bubbles) or near the upper electrode (deﬁned as\nboundary bubbles) [11], as shown in Fig. 17. For isolated\nbubbles, the polarity of the applied voltage has no effect on\nPD induced by isolated bubbles because the different polari-\nties only indicate the exchange of electrode positions. If only\nfor this case, then the ϕ–q and ϕ–n patterns should be sym-\nmetrical. However, the experiment results showed obvious\npolarity effect. There should be another situation, in which\nPD easily occurs in the negative half-cycle. This type might\nbe the PD induced by boundary bubbles. Fig. 3 shows that\nlarge bubbles are mainly distributed near the upper electrode\nand take longer to pass through the two electrodes, which\nmean that boundary bubbles stay longer in electric ﬁeld and\ntheir size is large. Furthermore, large bubbles are more likely\nto cause PD, as depicted in Fig. 13. The interface of boundary\nbubbles directly connects with the metal electrode, which can\nprovide additional sources of free electrons in the negative\nhalf-cycle. Therefore, most PDs induced by bubbles occurred\nin negative half-cycles.\nD. BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE\nThe breakdown voltages of ﬂowing transformer oil contain-\ning metal particles and bubbles were 42.0 kV and 31.6 kV ,\nrespectively, at the same oil gap in this experimental condi-\ntion. The presence of bubbles had a considerable effect on\nthe decrease in breakdown voltage. The phenomena may be\nrelated to the high average apparent charge of bubble-induced\nPD (Table 3). The higher the apparent charge, the more\nsevere the local overheating. Then, local overheating causes\nthe expansion of bubbles and the further decomposition of\nliquid, thereby producing additional gas. The streamer prop-\nagates with the development of the gas channel [40], [41].\nBreakdown occurs when the streamer connects the upper and\nlower electrodes. In addition to the high average appar-\nent charge, bubbles can directly participate in the process\nof streamer propagation, which also contributes to the low\nbreakdown voltage of transformer oil containing bubbles.\nAlthough the PD intensity induced by bubbles was smaller\nthan that of metal particles (Table 4), the breakdown voltage\nof transformer oil containing bubbles was lower than that of\nmetal particles, which suggests that bubbles also pose a great\nthreat to transformer insulation. Hence, it is important to ﬁrst\nidentify the type of defect in assessing the effect of insulation\ndefects on the insulation performance of transformer on the\nbasis of PD intensity.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, we obtained the motions of metal particles\nand bubbles in ﬂowing transformer oil. PD and breakdown\nexperiments in ﬂowing transformer were performed. The\neffects of the two impurities on the insulation performance\nof transformer oil was analyzed on the basis of their motions\nand the distortion of electric ﬁeld. The results showed that\nthe PDIV of metal particles was considerably lower than\nthat of bubbles. PD induced by metal particles had high\npulse repetition rate and small apparent charge, whereas PD\ninduced by bubbles had low pulse repetition rate and large\napparent charge. The PRPD patterns of metal particles were\nsymmetrical, whereas those of bubbles had remarkable polar-\nity effect, which may be used for fault identiﬁcation in the\nfuture.\nThe PD current pulses induced by metal particles had a\nshorter rise time and a severe oscillation, which could excite\nUHF signals. By contrast, the current pulses induced by bub-\nbles had a longer rise time and a weaker oscillation, and they\ncould not excite UHF signals. Therefore, as an online mon-\nitoring approach, the UHF method could not detect bubble-\ninduced PDs. In addition, the breakdown voltage of ﬂowing\ntransformer oil contaminated by bubbles was considerably\nlower than that of metal particles. Thus, the bubble detection\nshould be given further attention.\nThe oil ﬂow in an actual transformer is relatively compli-\ncated. Thus, oil ﬂows in horizontal and vertical directions.\nThe ﬂow direction directly affects the motions of impurities\nand discharge characteristics. For future studies, vertical oil\nﬂow direction should be considered.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Bagheri, A. Zollanvari, and S.
