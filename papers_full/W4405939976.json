Introduction\nIn recent years, the application of large language models (LLMs) in machine translation has become\nincreasingly widespread. Their breakthroughs in understanding and generating language have brought\nmachine translation closer to the essence of language. For example, Baidu Translate has launched an\nintelligent translation service based on large model technology, offering a one-stop professional\ntranslation solution for all scenarios, addressing issues that traditional machine translation struggles\nwith, such as understanding the original text and incorporating context. In October 2024, Alibaba\nintroduced its newly upgraded AI translation tool, MarcoMT, which was performance-evaluated based\non the Flores translation benchmark framework. DeepL, a company specializing in high-precision AI\ntranslation, launched new features for its DeepL Pro in 2024. The new version not only offers\nwww.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/eltls English Language Teaching and Linguistics Studies Vol. 6, No. 6, 2024\nPublished by SCHOLINK INC.\n115\nhigher-quality translation services but also includes industry-specific terminology databases.\nAdditionally, there are many other developments and upgrades in AI translation tools.\nWith the advancement of AI translation technology, the efficiency of information transmission is often\nconsidered the most important goal, while cultural representation is often regarded as secondary. This\nhas sparked new reflections on the development of translation technology and ethical issues,\nchallenging cultural subjectivity. Modern internet technology is the technical cause behind cultural\nnihilism (Zhang, 2024, p. 28). Furthermore, the use of AI translation tools, especially popular ones like\nChatGPT, brings about a series of problems. In the translation process, ChatGPT may exhibit biases on\nsensitive topics such as gender, race, and religion (Zhang, 2023, p. 80). In addition, ChatGPT may\nshow biases toward certain cultures and languages in its translations, such as overly emphasizing the\nvalues of some cultures while ignoring the characteristics and needs of others (Yu & Guo, 2024, p. 119).\nThis can affect the fairness and accuracy of the translation.\nThis paper will conduct an in-depth analysis of the challenges to cultural subjectivity in the AI\ntranslation process and the strategies for addressing them. By examining specific translation cases, it\nwill reveal the cultural subjectivity dilemmas currently faced by AI translation in the context of\nglobalization and propose corresponding optimization strategies. The aim of this research is to enhance\ntranslation quality and efficiency, ensuring that AI translation tools can more accurately reflect cultural\ndifferences. It also seeks to promote the gradual improvement of cultural adaptability in translation\ntools during cross-cultural information transmission, thereby achieving more precise, efficient, and\nculturally sensitive cultural representation.\n1.1 The Conflict between Hegemony in AI Translation and Cultural Subjectivity\n1.1.1 Cultural Hegemony\nThe issues in AI translation are primarily manifested in the fact that these models may inherit the\nviewpoints and biases of the original authors, and human intervention in the translation process can\nalso introduce the subjective biases of the reviewers. Since the pre-training corpora mainly come from\nWestern societies and cultures, the models are prone to being influenced by Western centrism. (Wen &\nTian, 2024, p. 32) For example, the political term “Publicity Department of the Communist Party of\nChina Central Committee” has many AI translation tools that translate it as “Propaganda Department of\nthe Communist Party of China”. Obviously, although “propaganda” means “advocate”, But it also\ncontains the derogatory meaning of “to advocate in a biased or misleading way”, which is easy to\nmislead the target language readers. Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained using vast\namounts of internet data, which often contain biases. For example, internet data may primarily be\ngenerated by young male authors from developed countries, which could lead to the model exhibiting\nbias when handling certain topics. (Jurafsky, 2000, p. 207) This can result in the transmission of\nincorrect values to readers. Translators have found that AI translation frequently translates “XX\nLeader” as “Mr. XX.” Furthermore, on January 16, 2024, International Business Machines Corporation\n(IBM) released the 2023 Global AI Adoption Index which surveyed 8,500 global IT professionals\nwww.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/eltls English Language Teaching and Linguistics Studies Vol. 6, No. 6, 2024\nPublished by SCHOLINK INC.\n116\nregarding the fastest-growing enterprise use cases for generative AI—IT automation, digital workforce,\nand customer service. The survey revealed that 42% of companies use AI screening tools, but many\nexperiments have shown that these tools tend to use biased parameters, such as favoring younger\ncandidates or men over women.\n1.1.2 Information Technology Hegemony\nJohn Zysman (2006) introduced the concept of the “algorithmic revolution” in his article (Zysman,\n2006), which became a core element driving the transformation of the entire digital economy. (Li, Y., &\nLi, J., 2023, pp. 73-84) Subsequently, American scholar Frank Luciano explicitly proposed “digital\nimperialism” in 2003. (Frank & Huang, 2003) Comprehensive algorithms are forming a global\nsurveillance system, leading to digital hegemony. (Liu, 2021) Information technology, as a derivative of\n“algorithms,” along with large language models and AI translation tools, represents a new era of\ninformation technology. These technologies, in their data collection, algorithm analysis, and text\nprocessing, reflect the values and culture of Western countries. Moreover, according to data released by\nthe China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, the Americas region has the\nlargest AI market, projected to reach $288.6 billion in 2023, accounting for 64.3% of the AI software\nmarket. In contrast, the Asia-Pacific market is smaller, estimated at $55 billion in 2023, which shows\nthat production and capital are increasingly concentrated in the hands of large digital multinational\ncorporations. This concentration gives rise to a series of issues. AI translation systems, when processing\ninformation, may replicate mainstream viewpoints and marginalize alternative knowledge, thereby\nreinforcing existing power structures and knowledge systems, resulting in a form of informational\nhegemony. (Lindemann, 2024, pp. 1-14) Furthermore, OpenAI’s release of the trillion-parameter\nmultimodal pre-trained model GPT-4, along with currently circulating AI chips and artificial large\nmodels such as AIGC, still see Western countries dominate the market. These developments\ndemonstrate their absolute control over the global digital market.\nIn this context, AI translation tools, whether in data input, text analysis, translation generation, or\noutput processes, are inevitably influenced by Western culture. The text analysis in AI translation tools\nprimarily involves natural language processing (NLP). As one of the key tools in the field of natural\nlanguage processing, large-scale language models describe patterns mathematically and learn from\nmassive amounts of textual data for text selection. The corpus, as the foundation of large-scale\nlanguage models, directly affects AI translation in terms of its size and diversity. However, not all data\nretrieved from large datasets are necessarily accurate. (Veljko, 2020, p. 206) Issues in the algorithm\ndesign of foreign large language models can lead to translation results that tend to reflect Western\ncultural perspectives and expressions. (Wang & Li, 2024) For example, when translating the political\nterm “make China a favored destination for foreign investment”, large language models may\nsimplistically translate it as “Invest in China,” Such translation methods fail to fully consider China's\nunique historical context, development process, and cultural connotations, resulting in an inability to\naccurately convey the political and cultural significance contained in the original text, which could\nwww.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/eltls English Language Teaching and Linguistics Studies Vol. 6, No. 6, 2024\nPublished by SCHOLINK INC.\n117\npotentially affect students’correct understanding of China’s political system and development path.\n2. The Impact of Hegemony in AI Translation on Cultural Subjectivity\n2.1 The Marginalization of Traditional Culture\nWith the widespread use ofAI translation tools, many local cultural traditions and folk arts in translated\ntexts may be influenced by hegemonic cultures and thus marginalized. The rapid development and\ntechnological progress of modern society promote a “more efficient” and “universal” cultural model,\noften neglecting the uniqueness and depth of traditional cultures. Cultural values rooted in history,\nreligion, language, and customs may be regarded as outdated or inconsistent with modern trends, and\neven gradually disappear. (Wang, Li, & Liang, 2024) Under the influence of cultural hegemony, the\nsubjectivity of traditional cultures may be weakened, and many indigenous values may be seen as\n“irrational” or “useless,” accelerating their decline in the context of globalization.\n2.2 Cultural Homogenization\nThe development of AI translation technology may exacerbate the erosion of cultural subjectivity by\nhegemonistic forces, leading to the marginalization or neglect of certain cultures, thereby weakening\nthe value of cultural diversity in global society. Driven by this cultural hegemony, different cultural\ntraits and traditions are easily replaced by a unified global cultural standard, resulting in the\ndisappearance of minority cultures, non-mainstream cultures, or local cultures. During the process of\nglobalization, the uniqueness of specific regions, ethnic groups, and belief systems may be overlooked,\nmaking cultural diversity more vulnerable. This uniformity of cultural hegemony not only erases\ncultural pluralism but may also lead to the loss of traditional knowledge and cultural creativity, and\neven trigger the dissolution of national character and identity.\n2.3 The Diminution of Cultural Identity\nAI translation tools often assume that all cultural differences are relative, and that the boundaries\nbetween cultures can be blurred or even dissolved. This hegemonic way of thinking may gradually\nweaken people's sense of identification with their own original culture. Traditional cultural values,\ncustoms, and historical memories are increasingly viewed as outdated and unnecessary. Especially\nunder the influence of globalization and information technology, many local cultural features and\ntraditions are replaced by standardized global culture, making cultural identity increasingly vague.\nCultural hegemony, by diminishing cultural differences, may reduce individuals’ or groups’ attachment\nto and pride in traditional culture, thereby affecting the formation of cultural subjectivity.\n3. Strategies to Counteract Hegemony inAI Translation\n3.1 At the National Level\nCurrently, bilingual parallel corpora internationally are largely centered around English, and the\nmultilingual service industry has become the main arena for the United States to seek its discourse\ninfluence. Therefore, it is imperative for the country to accelerate the construction of multilingual\nwww.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/eltls English Language Teaching and Linguistics Studies Vol. 6, No. 6, 2024\nPublished by SCHOLINK INC.\n118\nChinese-centered parallel corpora. (Wang, 2022) The government should actively promote the\ndevelopment of large-scale localized training datasets to ensure the diversity and compatibility of these\ndatasets, reducing biases and mistranslations caused by data imbalance. This not only helps break the\nWestern-centric model of corpus construction but also allows for the proactive control of cultural\ndissemination. (Wang, 2024) In addition, the government should actively support the research and\ndevelopment of large language models led by Chinese, enhancing the ability to process Chinese\ninformation and improve Chinese-to-foreign translation capabilities. Through policy support, financial\ninvestment, and talent cultivation, the country can gradually reduce dependence on foreign models,\nthus avoiding infiltration or manipulation by hegemonic national ideologies. The development of AI\ntranslation tools requires the state to strengthen the governance of artificial intelligence, actively\npromote international cooperation in the field of AI development, and form consensus to prevent\ncertain countries or regions from using AI technology to promote unilateralism and hegemonism. Of\ncourse, this requires the international community to work together to build a fair and reasonable AI\ngovernance framework.\n3.2 At Social Level\nIn today’s rapidly developing global society, it is important for society to focus on cultivating the\npublic's cultural critical awareness, guiding people to recognize the limitations of AI translation tools,\nand encouraging the use of language expressions that align with local cultural values. This approach\nhelps avoid the risks of cultural homogenization and unification, prevents political conflicts arising\nfrom cultural clashes, and highlights the cultural tension unique to China. (Sun, 2008) Especially when\ntranslating texts related to values, moral norms, and social ethics, it is essential to deeply understand\nthe cultural background behind them. When applying large language models, the human-centered\napproach should be adhered to, strengthening critical thinking abilities, enhancing awareness of\ntechnological ethics, and clarifying the boundaries and relationships in human-machine collaboration.\nThis ensures that translation teaching is not only humane but also deep and innovative, effectively\naddressing the challenges brought about by over-reliance on large language models. (Wang & Xie,\n2024)\nSociety should strengthen the ethical and legal regulation of AI translation to ensure that AI translation\ntools respect user privacy, protect intellectual property, and avoid generating misleading information or\nbiases. (Li, Du, & Ma, 2022) Furthermore, AI translation systems need to have cultural awareness,\nenabling them to understand and address language differences caused by cultural disparities; otherwise,\nmisunderstandings or even offenses may occur.\n3.3 At the Individual Level\nIndividuals should first enhance their cultural awareness and cultural confidence, cultivate\ncross-cultural sensitivity, and fully recognize that language is not just a conversion of words but a\ncarrier of culture. When using AI translation tools, they should remain vigilant and avoid blindly\nadopting Western cultural expressions. In addition, individuals should continually improve their\nwww.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/eltls English Language Teaching and Linguistics Studies Vol. 6, No. 6, 2024\nPublished by SCHOLINK INC.\n119\ntranslation skills, especially when translating content involving complex cultural and ideological topics,\nand try to avoid relying solely on AI translation tools. By employing human editing and proofreading,\ntranslation quality can be enhanced to ensure both accuracy and cultural appropriateness. In daily life,\nindividuals can participate in translation practices, such as literary translation and academic translation,\nto hone their translation abilities, while also reflecting on and improving the limitations of AI\ntranslation tools. By comparing the effects of AI translation and human translation, individuals can\nbetter understand the limitations of algorithms and the creativity inherent in human translation.\n4. Conclusion\nWith the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the widespread application\nof advanced large language models like ChatGPT in the field of translation, translation teaching and\npractice are undergoing profound changes. However, the use of these technologies has also raised\nissues of cultural hegemony, particularly in areas such as data sources, algorithm design, values, and\ndiscourse structures. For example, foreign large language models, which rely primarily on data trained\nfrom Western societies, often carry Western-centric biases, which are particularly evident when\ntranslating texts related to Chinese history, culture, and politics. To address these challenges, research\nhas proposed several strategies. First, it is necessary to build diverse and inclusive corpora to reduce\nbiases and mistranslations caused by data imbalance, thus breaking the Western-centric model of\ncorpus construction. Second, the logic of AI translation must be carefully examined to avoid\nover-reliance on technology. Students should be encouraged to combine their professional knowledge\nto verify and optimize AI translation results, thus preventing cultural misinterpretation and other\nfundamental errors. In addition, it is essential to strengthen cultural critical awareness, cultivate\nstudents' cultural consciousness and confidence, safeguard cultural diversity, and promote the healthy\ndevelopment of ideology in translation education. Through these strategies, the cultural hegemony traps\nposed by large language models can be effectively avoided, fostering the sustainable development of\ntranslation education and contributing to the protection of national cultural security and the\nenhancement of cultural soft power.\nReferences\nFrank, L.
