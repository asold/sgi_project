INTRODUCTION \nSustaining the distribution power substation's health and \ndependability has been an issue for many years. As a result, \nmaintenance staff would occasionally turn off transformers \nand circuit breakers to see if they were functioning properly. \nThere are still catastrophic failures with this strategy, not to \nmention unnecessary maintenance. The introduction of \nonline monitoring and artificial intelligence analysis \ntechniques has been used to the electrical distribution power \nsubstation in response to a rising need for lower cost and more \nefficient diagnostic tools . In this research, an intelligent \nmonitoring system that can check the temperature level of the \ntransformer continuously and predict faults such as \noverheating, overcurrent, after which the fault diagnosis is \nrelayed to the base station through the Global  System for \nMobile Communications (GSM) modem will be developed. \nAs a result, maintenance may be done as needed rather than \nregularly. The ATmega Microcontroller -based system has \nbeen created to continually monitor the temperature during its \noperation.

In addition, the \nsystems show the values all through the operation for the \nuser's reference and provide further inform ation about the \ntransformer's present state. As a result, the technology \nimproves the transformer's security, intelligence, and \nrobustness. \nThere are some flaws and concerns with the monitoring \nequipment or systems that are currently employed to monitor \ndistribution transformers. The following are a handful of \nthem [10]-[15]: \n(a) A typical transformer measurement system detects only \none transformer parameter, such as power, current, voltage, \nor phase. While some methods can detect several factors, the \nacquisition time and operation parameters are too long, and \nthe testing speed is insufficient. \n(b) Several monitoring systems convey data using \"power \ncarrier communication\", but this method has some \ndrawbacks, including serious frequency interference, signal \nattenuation as distance increases, and large electrical noise \ncaused by load variations. As a result, if data is sent through \n\"power carrier communication, real -time data\"  transfer and \nreliability may be compromised [10]-[13]. \nBased on the given specificati ons, we need a distribution \ntransformer real-time monitoring system to detect all system \nparameters and report them to the monitoring centre \npromptly. It allows for real -time tracking of important \noperating characteristics of the transformer, which can giv e \nvaluable data on transformer health. This will allow utilities \nto make the most of existing transformers and keep them in \nservice for longer. This will aid in the early detection of \nissues, resulting in considerable cost reductions and increased \nreliability. The extensive application of mobile networks and \nGSM equipment such as GSM modems, as well as their lower \ncosts, have rendered them an appealing alternative not only \nfor voice media but also for other large network applications \n[10]-[13]. \nAn embedded system, GSM modem, mobile users, cellular \nnetworks, and sensors deployed at the transformer's location \nmake up the online tracking system. On the transformer, \nsensors measure the physical quantity from the distribution \ntransformer before converting it to a n analogue signal. The \ntransformer's location houses the integrated module.

The GSM module is the second. It connects the \nembedded system with the public GSM network. The third is \na utility module, which is controlled by a PC -based server at \nthe utility control centre. The server is connected to a GSM \nmodem and receives and sends SMS to and from the \ntransformer [1]-[3], [10]-[13]. \nLi et al. in [12] developed an electromagnetic environment \nmulti-parameter monitoring system for distribution \ntransformers capable of relaying the health status of the \ntransformer in real -time to an observer. The system, which \nused GSM, ensured a safe and reliable power grid. Srivastava \nand Tripathi [4] and Pawar et al.  [22] proposed the \nimplementation of this notion using the internet of things \n(IoT) to obtain the real -time state of the distribution \ntransformer. The proposed health monitoring system \nincorporates a temperature sensor, a potential transformer, \nand a current transformer to monitor the temperature, voltage, \nand current of the distribution transformer and send this \ninformation to a remote server where it can be monitored, and \nnecessary action taken to avoid a power outage. The authors \nin [22] observed that transformers decrease the primary \nvoltage to the usage voltage for customer use in energy \ndistribution and transmission. The study of Pawar and co \noffered a system which monitor different paramet ers of the \ndistribution transformer. The system consisted of both the \nremote terminal unit (RTU) and the monitoring unit. Remote \nterminal unit includes of evaluating factors such as current, \ntemperature, rise and fall in oil level, vibration and humidity \nwith the help of PIC 18F4550. All monitoring parameters are \nevaluated and if any irregularity happens, the system sends \nalert messages to the mobile phones and recorded in system \nmemory through the analogue to digital converter. General \nPacket Radio Service  (GPRS) was used to deliver all \nparameter values to the monitoring node. If an emergency \nsituation arises, a message will be sent to the corresponding \nengineer by GSM, and we will be notified via GPRS on our \nwebpage. A buzzer will sound near the remote ter minal \ndevice, and an LCD will display information regarding the \nemergency situation. Because an engineer at a transformer \ncannot keep a constant check on the transformer, the \nsuggested solution used a GSM/GPRS module to \ncommunicate with us in the event of a distribution \ntransformer emergency. \nBhavarkar et al. [1], Kadam et al. [2] and Kepa et al. [3] \nsuggested a remote mobile embedded system that combines a \nGSM/GPRS module with an Arduino microcontroller board \nas well as sensor packages. \nMahesar et al . [5] designed and implemented mobile \ninterfaced systems to monitor and record critical \ncharacteristics of a 500 KVA Distribution Transformer, such \nas load current, voltage, oil level, transformer vibration, and \ntemperature. This monitoring system combined  a GSM \nmodem with a standalone single -chip Raspberry PI3 \ncontroller, functions as a mini -computer and interfaces with \nnumerous sensors. This system was situated at the \ndistribution transformer position, and the above -mentioned \nparameters were recorded by an embedded system's analogue \nto digital converter (ADC). The parameter received is then \nprocessed and stored in the system memory. When an \nabnormal or emergency state occurs, the system sends a short \nmessage to the mobile phone via a GMS -based mobile \nnetwork. In addition, Fahim et al. [6] noted the prevalence of \nthe theft of small transformers in their locality in southeast \nAsia and consequently devised a GSM -based transformer \ntheft protection and monitoring system. A transformer's \nhealth parameters can als o be monitored by the system. The \nsystem proposed in the study utilises many sensors, including \na magnetic sensor, infrared sensors, and weight sensors, to \ndetect nearby people who want to steal or vandalize the \ntransformer and contact the authorities via GSM technology's \nSMS service. Furthermore, the authorities can keep track of \ntransformer health indicators like temperature and oil level.  \nShetty and Co [10] sought to prevent the distribution \ntransformer from overload damage by devising a method that \ncontinually monitors the transformer's load and transmits that \ninformation to a smartphone.  An observer can see the \ncontinuous information about the transformer on the display. \nThe information reported include why the transformer failed, \nwhen the electricity was restored, and so on. The department's \nmaintenance personnel can keep a constant eye on the \ntransformer with the aid of this type of technology. Therefore, \nthis study develops a monitoring system that can continually \ncheck the temperature level of the transformer and predict \ndefects such as overheating and overcurrent, after which the \nfault diagnosis is transmitted to the base station through a \nGSM modem. Hassan developed and built a mobile system to \nmonitor and record important distribution transformer  data \nlike load current, oil level, and ambient temperature in [11]. \nBefore any disaster, an online monitoring system includes a \nworldwide service mobile (GSM) modem, a freestanding \nsingle-chip microprocessor, and other sensors. It is installed \nat the dist ribution transformer site and records the above \nparameters using the system's ADC. The parameters acquired \nare processed and stored in the system memory. If an \nabnormality or an emergency scenario arises, the system \nsends an SMS to the phone with informati on about the \nanomaly, based on predetermined instructions encoded in the \nmicrocontroller. This transportable device will assist \ntransformers in running smoothly and detecting failures. \nChavan and Co [13] noted accurately that monitoring of a \ntransformer's physical properties presents a number of \ndifficulties. Currently, distribution transformers require the \ncreation of a data collection system that can be utilized for \ncondition monitoring. This in turn will aid in fault \nidentification and prevention. Subsequently, the authors used \nGSM to remotely monitor the transformer's characteristics, \nwhich saves time and effort. To monitor characteristics such \nas voltages, currents, and temperatures, we developed an \nembedded system architecture. This system reads sensor s, \nanalyses data, and provides remote monitoring. An \nATMEGA2560 Arduino was utilized to operate, process, and \ncommunicate between modules. \nA. Sensors Used in Transformer Monitoring System \nIn the authors in [20] recognised  that power transformers \nare critical components in power transmission networks that \ntransport energy from a source to a consumer. And that in situ \ndiagnostics of power transformer performance offers a \nnumber of advantages for ensuring dependable energy \ntransmission. Its immunity to electromagnetic interference, \n    European Journal of Engineering and Technology Research \nISSN: 2736-576X \n \nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.24018/ejeng.2022.7.2.2733   Vol 7 | Issue 2 | March 2022 24 \n \nhigh sensitivity, good insulation, and tiny optical sensing \ndimensions makes it ideal for power transformer monitoring \napplications. Therefore, partially discharge, dissolved gases, \ntemperature and other essential sensing, and optical detection \nwere all discussed in the authors work as diagnostic \nprocedures for power transformers. The benefits and \ndrawbacks of various monitoring strategies were thoroughly \naddressed and weighed. Finally, the current technical barriers \nto optical monitoring systems for power transformers were \ndiscussed, as well as their future potential. \nAnother area of concern is transformer insulation. The \ninsulating state of a transformer often determines its life span. \nThe authors i n [21] noted that partial discharge is the most \ncommon cause of insulation failure. Partial discharges (PDs) \nare electrical discharges that occur in the transformer \ninsulation system. The presence of PDs causes the \ntransformer insulation system to deterior ate. To avoid \ncatastrophic transformer breakdown, it is vital to measure and \ndetect the PD at an early stage. For PD monitoring in power \ntransformers, different PD detection and measurement \ntechnologies, such as electrical, chemical, acoustic, UHF, and \noptical methods, are being used. Traditional PD monitoring \nmethods, such as electrical or chemical, have certain \ndrawbacks. To address these challenges, the optical Fiber \nBragg Grating (FBG) Sensor was employed as a PD sensor \nfor PD monitoring in the power tr ansformer. The authors \nwork examined the use of FBG sensors as a PD monitoring \nsensor in an oil-filled power transformer. \n \nII. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION \nThe block and circuit diagram of the proposed GSM-based \ntransformer monitoring system is shown in Fig. 1 and 2 \nrespectively. \n \nFig. 1. The block diagram of the system. \n \nFrom Fig. 1, it will be noticed that the key components of \nthe proposed system include a microcontroller, temperature \nand current sensor, GSM modem, liquid crystal display \n(LCD) and an ADC. \nA. Component Description \n1) Microcontroller  \nIn this study, the ATmega328 was used. It has the \nfollowing characteristics: 8 Kbytes of Read -While-Write In-\nSystem Programmable Flash, 512 bytes of EEPROM, 1 \nKbyte of SRAM, 18 general -purpose I/O lines, configurable \ntimer/counters with comparison modes, interrupts, and a 6 -\nchannel ADC with 10-bit accuracy The CPU is turned off in \nidle mode, while the SRAM, timer/counters, SPI port, and \ninterrupt system continue to work [16], [17].  \n \n \nFig. 2. Circuit diagram of the monitoring system. \n \n2) Sensors  \nWithin the transformer premises, sensors are used to read \nand measure the physical quantity from the distribution \ntransformer before converting it to an analogue signal. The \nload current, ambient temperature, winding temperature,  oil \ntemperature, and oil level are all monitored via sensors. When \nthe sensor is triggered, it receives and responds to a signal. \nFor real -time tracking, a variety of different quantifiable \nvariables can be gathered. However, using the complete \nspectrum is rarely necessary. As a result, the sensor must be \ntailored to the individual needs of a transformer -based on its \noverall condition. The two sensors used are discussed next. \n2.1) LM 35-aTemperature Sensor \nThe LM35 is a temperature sensor that can measure \ntemperatures from 0 to 150 degrees Celsius. It's a three -\nterminal gadget that outputs an analogue voltage proportional \nto temperature. The output voltage increases as the \ntemperature rises. The output analogue voltage can be \nconverted to digital form using  an ADC and then processed \nby a microcontroller. Commercially available temperature \nand current sensors are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b) \nrespectively. \n \n \n(a) (b) \nFig. 3. Sensors (a)LM 35- temperature sensor (b)ACS712 current sensor \n[8]. \n\n    European Journal of Engineering and Technology Research \nISSN: 2736-576X \n \nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.24018/ejeng.2022.7.2.2733   Vol 7 | Issue 2 | March 2022 25 \n \n2.2) ACS712 Current Sensor \nFull-scale readings of 30A are available for this current \nsensor. This sensor is based on the Allegro ACS712ELC chip, \nwhich works on the Hall -effect concept. The concept is \ndefined as when a current -carrying conductor is put in a \nmagnetic field, a voltage is formed across its edges that is \nperpendicular to both the current and the magnetic field \ndirections. \n2.3) LM35 Temperature Sensor Interfacing with \nATmega323 \nThe LM35 temperature sensor has three terminals, the VCC, \nout and the ground, the VCC is connected to the 5v dc supply \nof the regulated power supply, and the out terminal is \nconnected to Pin 40 of the ATmega328 then the third terminal \nis connected to the g round. The connection is shown in Fig. \n4. \n \nFig. 4. LM35 temperature sensor interfacing with ATmega328 [7] \n \n2.4) ACS712 current sensor interfacing with ATmega328 \nThe ACS712 current sensor has VCC, out, ground and the \ntwo outputs going to the load. The conn ections with the \nmicrocontroller and with load are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. \n \n \nFig. 5. ACS712 Current Sensor Interfacing with Atmega328 [8]. \n \n \nFig. 6. Connection of ACS712 current sensor with the load. \nB. Power Supply  \nAfter programming the microcontroller, it  needs to be \npowered to standalone, so there is a need for a power supply \nsystem. The power supply provides the required dc voltage \nfor the other circuits to operate. Although we receive 220  V \nAC from the mains, the remaining components of our circuit \ndemand 5 V DC. This is achieved by employing a step-down \ntransformer and a bridge rectifier. The step-down transformer \nis employed to provide 12 V AC, which is then rectified to \n12 V DC. The rectifier's output still has some ripples, which \nare eliminated by me ans of a capacitor serving as a filter \ncircuit.  A positive voltage regulator chip, 7805, reduces the \n12 V DC to 5 V.  \nC. The GSM Modem and Interfacing with LCD and \nAtmega328 \nA GSM modem is a type of wireless modem that connects \nto a GSM network. A wireless modem functions similarly to \na dial -up modem. The main distinction is that a dial -up \nmodem sends and receives data through a fixed telephone \nline, whereas a wireless modem sends and receives data via \nradio frequency (GSM 900/1800 bands). A GSM mod em \nneeds a SIM card from an operator to function [14], [15]. Fig. \n7 shows a commercially available GSM modem. \n \n \nFig. 7. GSM modem. (https://www.indiamart.com/). \n \nSerial connections between the modem and the \nmicrocontroller are accomplished in the system b y \nconnecting Txd and Rxd pins to the modem Rxd and Txd \npins, respectively. The modem's third pin is also grounded. \nWe have an interface modem to microcontroller directly \nwithout the usage of Max232 or RS232 in our hardware \narchitecture, and we are getting good results with good \ncommunication. Logic converters such as Max232 and \nRS232 are also utilized [15]. \nThey may both operate at the CMOS and TTL logic levels. \nIf the microcontroller is TTL and the GSM modem is CMOS, \na logic converter such as RS232 is used to bring the two logic \nlevels together. However, because both the Microcontroller \nand the GSM Modem in our model operate at the TTL logic \nlevel, we have not used Max232 or RS232. The modem and \nthe microcontroller are connected directly [15]. The \nconnection is depicted in Fig. 8. \n \n\n    European Journal of Engineering and Technology Research \nISSN: 2736-576X \n \nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.24018/ejeng.2022.7.2.2733   Vol 7 | Issue 2 | March 2022 26 \n \n \nFig. 8. GSM modem interfacing with ATmega328 [9]. \n \nD. The Relay and Its Interfacing with ATmega328 \nRelays are switches  that open and close circuits \nelectromechanically or electronically. \n \n \nFig. 9. Relay interfacing with ATmega328. \n \nRelays control one electrical circuit by opening and closing \ncontacts in another circuit. As relay diagrams show, when a \nrelay contact is normally open (NO), there is an open contact \nwhen the relay is not energized. When a relay contact is \nNormally Closed (NC), there is a closed contact when the \nrelay is not energized. In either case, applying electrical \ncurrent to the contacts will change their state. The connection \nis shown in Fig. 9.  \nE. Liquid Crystal Display \nThe display is a 16x2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), which \nmeans there are 16 characters per line and two lines. The \nHD44780U standard refers to the controller chip that accepts \ndata from a n external source (in this case, the Atmega328) \nand communicates directly with the LCD. The LCD is set to \nits 8-bit mode, which means it uses an 8-bit data bus. EN, RS, \nand RW are the three control lines. \"Enable\" is the name of \nthe EN line. This control l ine is used to inform the LCD that \ndata is being sent. The application should first set the other \ntwo control lines or put data on the data bus before delivering \ndata to the LCD. \nBring EN high and wait for the minimum amount of time \nspecified by the LCD datasheet before bringing it low again. \nThe RS line stands for \"Register Select.\" The data is \nhandled as a command or special instruction when RS is low \n(0) (such as clear screen, position cursor, etc.). The data \ndelivered when the RS is high (1) is text data that is displayed \non the screen. Set RS high, for example, to display the letter \n\"B\" on the screen. The \"Read/Write\" control line is the RW \nline. The information on the data bus is written to the LCD \nwhen RW is low (0). The software successfully questions (or \nreads) the LCD when RW is high (1). The read command \nconsists of only one instruction (\"Get LCD status\"). All of the \nother instructions are written commands, so RW will always \nbe below [18,19]. \nThe lines of an 8-bit data bus are designated as DB0, DB1, \nDB2, DB3, DB4, DB5, DB6, and DB7. \n \nIII. PROCEDURE FOR HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION   \nThe sequence of methodologies followed in the monitoring \nof distribution transformer via GSM technology are \nhighlighted as follows [15]: \na. First, sensors positioned at the transformer site sense \nvarious transformer properties and convert them into \nanalogue signals that may be processed in signal \nconditioning circuits. \nb. The SCC, which is made up of op -amps and \nresistors, then converts the analogue signal to a \nvalue that can be read by the embedded system. \nc. A microcontroller is then used to process the signal. \nThe ADC is utilized to read the parameters, and the \nembedded software program that handles parameter \nacquisition, processing, displaying, transmitting, \nand receiving is hou sed in the built -in EEPROM. \nThe observed parameters well as the hourly and \ndaily averages are saved in the onboard EEPROM. \nd. The microcontroller is connected to the GSM \nmodem through a RS 232 adaptor, which allows it \nto post and retrieve SMS messages contain ing \ninformation on the transformer's characteristics and \nstatus.  \ne. The modem then delivers a short message service to \nmobile users with information on the  transformers' \nsettings and values. \n \nFig. 10. Snapshot of the developed transformer monitoring system. \n\n    European Journal of Engineering and Technology Research \nISSN: 2736-576X \n \nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.24018/ejeng.2022.7.2.2733   Vol 7 | Issue 2 | March 2022 27 \n \nTo make the construction, testing, and maintenance easier, \nthe system was built in modules as intended and then \nconnected after completion. A prototype of the system \ndepicted in Fig. 10 was built on a breadboard first, then \nmoved to Veroboard once it was proven to be functional. The \nwhole system circuit was meticulously planned out to reduce \nerror and simplify troubleshooting. \n \nIV. TESTING AND RESULTS \nDuring the development of the overall system, the \nhardware and software components were spli t into units. \nSmaller components of the system were built and tested, \nmaking it more manageable and efficient. The power supply \nunit was initially tested to confirm that it could provide the \ncircuit with the necessary power. Before connecting with the \nmicrocontroller, the temperature sensing device was also \ntested, and it was discovered to be capable of generating an \naccurate output signal corresponding to varying \ntemperatures. The current sensor was then verified before \nbeing connected to the microcontroller. The outputs from the \nmodule were conditioned and supplied to the microcontroller \nonce it was determined that the temperature sensing unit and \ncurrent sensing unit gave accurate data.  \nThe GSM modem was tested with a DC 9V battery before \ninterfacing wit h the microcontroller. After the final testing \nand coupling of the modules, the device was found to be \nworking.  The snapshot of the device observing transformer \nstatus is shown in Fig. 11(a)-(d). \n \n \nFig. 11. Results of the testing of the GSM modem. \n \nV. CONCLUSION  \nGSM-based transformer monitoring is more convenient \nand more reliable than manual monitoring since it is \nimpossible to manually monitor environmental temperature \nrise and load current all of the time. We may take prompt \naction after getting a notice  of any irregularity to avert \ndisastrous system breakdowns. There are numerous \ndistribution transformers in a distribution network, and by \nidentifying each transformer with a system, we can quickly \ndetermine which transformer is experiencing a problem based \non the message provided to mobile. We don't need to inspect \nall transformers and their phase currents and voltages, so the \nsystem may be recovered in less time. Although the time it \ntakes to receive messages may vary owing to public GSM \nnetwork traffic, it is still more effective than manual \nmonitoring. \nThis system can contain a server module that receives and \nstores transformer parameter information from all of a \nutility's distribution transformers in a database application \nregularly. This database will be a valuable resource for utility \ntransformer information. Analyses of the recorded data will \nassist the utility in monitoring the functioning of its \ndistribution transformers and identifying issues before they \nbecome catastrophic, resulting in considerab le cost savings \nand improved system dependability. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to appreciate those who helped in \nthe typesetting of this manuscript, provided technical \nassistance during the course of this study and the reviewers \nof this the manuscript. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Bhavarkar S, Kore P, Ambare V, Dalne A, Amane G, Kapse S.
