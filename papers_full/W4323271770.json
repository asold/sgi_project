(2023) and Grimaldi and Ehrler (2023) \nthat these tools will inevitably be introduced to scientific writing and publishing. In \nfact, LLMs may soon become integrated in the process of writing articles, and even \npeer review and editorial decisions. \nFor this reason, and following suggestions made in (Nature, 2023) and (van Dis, \n2023), we will for now require all authors of submissions to JDIS to acknowledge \nthe use of an LLM if they did so.\nLike many colleagues, we are following the developments involving LLMs with \ngreat interest and excitement about their potential to accelerate and improve the sci-\nentific publishing process.\nCo Editors-in-Chief \nRonald Rousseau & Liying Yang\nVice Editors\nJohan Bollen & Zhesi Shen\nReferences\nvan Dis, E.
