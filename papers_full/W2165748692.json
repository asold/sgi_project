    "abstract": "This paper presents and investigates planar and coaxial high frequency power transformers used for DC/DC converters in a three phase photo voltaic (PV) power systems. The winding structure including a Faraday shield between the primary and secondary windings is designed to minimize eddy current losses, skin and proximity effects, and to reduce the leakage inductance, and the inter winding coupling capacitance. Finite Element Method is employed to analyze the magnetic flux and eddy current distributions. The two different kinds of prototype high frequency transformers are designed and tested. The simulation and experiment results are demonstrated and compared with non-shielded transformers. The shielded transformers have achieved the expected results with a relatively small coupling capacitance, compared with the conventional high frequency transformer. This shield decreases the inter-winding coupling capacitance Cps.",
