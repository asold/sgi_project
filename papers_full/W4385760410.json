[1]” is interesting. Mal-\nlio et al. observed that artificial intelligence applications in \nmedicine are rapidly expanding. Large language models \n(LLMs) have lately gained popularity as useful tools in radi-\nology, and they are currently being explored for the crucial \ntask of structured reporting [1 ]. Mallio et al. analyzed four \nLLMs models in terms of structured reporting knowledge \nand template proposal. LLMs have a lot of potential for \ncreating structured reports in radiology, but further formal \nvalidations are needed [2].\nGiven how quickly AI is progressing, we both believe \nit is critical to thoroughly analyze any new technological \napplication. AI, a computational tool, based its response on \npublicly available information that could have come from \nlegitimate or questionable sources. Sensitive information \ncannot be created, reviewed, or approved by AI. Without \nhuman assessment, AI should not be used to develop, assess, \nor approve sensitive information [2]. A significant and con-\ntentious issue in AI is data accuracy. However, it is crucial to \nconsider how AI should be applied ethically. The ChatGPT \nmay generate information that is immediately relevant even \nwithout user interaction. Adequate intake control measures \nmay stop abuse from increasing. However, it might still be \nbeneficial. It may be necessary at this time to offer rules for \nthe ethical and effective usage of AI. It is crucial to keep in \nmind that people, not AI, decide whether or not AI is effec-\ntive and moral to employ.\nAuthor contributions AK involved in 50% ideas, writing, analyzing, \nand approval.
