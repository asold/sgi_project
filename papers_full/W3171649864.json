The necessity of the primary transformers rapidly increases due \nto the fast development of the microprocessing automated control systems \nand operation of the railway transport power supply devices, transferring to \nthe flexible automated output. These transformers , besides high metrology \ncharacteristics, have to be highly reliable, have a wide range of change, \nstability, little dimensions. \n1 Introduction \nToday, not only in our country but worldwide, microprocessor -based automated control \nsystems are developing rapidly. The need for primary transformers is growing rapidly due \nto the operation of railway power supply equipment, the transition to flexible aut omated \nproduction. First of all, these transformers must be highly reliable, have a wide range of \nvariability, stability,  and dimensions, in addition to high metrological properties . \nElectromagnetic current transformers meet these requirements most of all.  Increasing \nmarket demand makes producers constantly enlarge the number of issued current \ntransformers. \n2 Methods \nAccording to the Research Institute of Physics Research (RIPR) [1], there exist about 400 \nphysics phenomena nowadays , which can become ground  for creating modern measure \nmeans – primary measure transformers.  Some loom capacity control methods of weaving \nmachines are known today [2]. One of the side effects of each electrical device's work is the \nelectromagnetic field generated near its workplace. All organisms, including humans, are \nexposed daily to the influence of different types of this field, characterized by distinct \nphysical parameters [3]. \nThe most labor - and time-consuming is the initial period of project -making when it is \nnecessary to define the primary transformer's physical principle and construction realization \n[4, 5]. \n                                                 \n* Corresponding author: mustafoali777@gmail.com \n© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

In the case of \nthe alternative current transforming, the necessity of modulation disappears. \n \nFig.1. Principles of construction of parameter structural schemes ECT \nIt is important to notify that the number of structural schemes can be increased , taking \ninto account inter-chain passages presented as topogrammes. In this case, the transformer is \nconsidered the complex of elementary chains, each of them reflects the primary \ntransforming of one quantity into another quantity or parameter. \nCoefficients of these parts transferring are either parameters of chains if relative parts \nreflect transformation within the chain of the same physical nature, or the coefficient of \nphysical effects between chains if parts reflect the transformation of quantities of one \nphysical nature into the quantity or parameter of the other physical nature. \nGraphically the set of the elementary inter chain dependences is presented as a \ntopogram. Topogram of the i nter-chain dependences for the chains of different physical \nnature, connected with each other by graphic symbols of between chain physical effects,  \nform general topogram of inter -chain dependences and between chain physical effects. \nTopograms of the inter-chain dependencies are the same for all chains of different physical \nnature. \nIt is presented in the article that from the topogram of dependences of only two different \nchains – electric and magnetic – the number of possible variants of the structural schemes \nof the electric current transformer into electric voltage is quite big. \nIn the case of using three chains of different nature (optic -magnetic-electric, mechanic-\nmagnetic-electric, or nuclear -magnetic-electric), the number of possible variants of the \nstructural scheme of the electric current transformer into electric voltage will exceed seven \nsymbols figure. \nTo define most construction realizations, reflecting each PTE, method of morphology \nanalysis and synthesis of technical decisions is chosen [10, 11].  According to this method, \nthe stage of composing the morphology matrix (MM), i.e. , achieving the generalized \ndescription of the technical device all construction realizations , is called morphology \nanalysis, and the stage of extracting the technical device construction realizations from MM \nis called morphology synthesis. \nThe morphology matrix for PTE synthesis, chosen by PSS, is presented in figure 2. \nThe number of classification characteristics in it is equal to the number of PTE and \nparameters of PSS. The number of possible realizations of each PTE or parameter is equal \n3\nE3S Web of Conferences 264, 05038 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202126405038\nCONMECHYDRO - 2021\nto the number of  single and pair opposite characteristics, for example, sensitivity (S) , \nerror (γ), nonlinearity (ε ), sensitivity-price (S – P), error-price (γ –P), and so on. Total \nnumber of possible construction realizations of ECT is equal to N = 5.5.5 = 125. \nClassification of the morphology characteristics notions is made with the following \nassumptions: 1) each morphology characteristics notion can be estimated independently \nfrom the other characteristics notions; 2) morphology characteristics have the same \nparameters as PTE itself. Considering  these assumptions, each morphology \ncharacteristic notion is classified on the chosen characteristics on the method of pair \ncomparison for non-strict classification. \nEstimation of morphology characteristics notions method is realized as follows: on \nthe base of pair comparison of each morphology characteristics notion with every other \nmatrix of comparison is built ),1;,1( njniijA  . For each characteristic separate \nmatrix is built. \nElements of the main diagonal are equal to zero.

Morphology matrix for PTE synthesis \nFor example, on the nonlinearity for m orphology matrix, presented in figure 2, mentioned \nmatrix for characteristics – PTE amper-coils have the following image: \n0111\n1001\n1001\n1000\nA , \n3\n2\n2\n1\nB ,  \n1\n2\n2\n3\nC . \n \nLet's assume we need the synthesis of EPT with maximal possible sensitivity. \nEstimation of characteristics notions is made by the method of pair comparison for non -\nstrict classification. The supposition is made that the variant, fixing the best notions in the \nmorphology matrix, will be the best  from the point of view of the searched goal. The \ncharacteristics notion for which sensitivity is maximal is registered on ea ch line in every \nmorphology matrix.  \nFor the considered EPT , we receive the following combination of characteristics \nnotions: implementation of PTE amper -coils – multicoil core with general  winding, \nimplementation of the magnetic capacity parameter – core with high magnetic inductivity, \nHall's effect – electric magnetic induction – multicoil core with general measuring winding. \nAs a result of morphology synthesis , we receive EPT construction [11, 12 ] with high \nsensitivity and regulated range, presented in figure 3. \nThe construction consists of a metal circle, fulfilled in the form of two axes ring \nelements 1 and 2 with diameter connection 3 and 4, in the body at the opposite sited of \nwhich there are holes \n \n \nFig.3. Construction of EPT with increased sensitivity and regulated range \n1 , ring elements 1 and 2 are insulated from each other by dielectric 5 and are situated in \nthe mirror reflection , iron magnetic closed core 6with measuring winding 7, staged on the \nconnections 3 and 4, situated on the opposite edges of the circle of the current receiving \noutputs 8. \nThis implementation of the metal circle allows decreasing the sensitivity limit (to \nincrease sensitivity) of the transformer. \nEPT works on the following principle. Through the  chain of the current receiving \noutputs 8 current under control passes. Measuring winding 7 is switched to the meter. \nIn the controlled chain , the maximal current of the meter range is established. Turning \nthe metal ring in the scale , the necessary quantit y of the outgoing signal is established.  \n5\nE3S Web of Conferences 264, 05038 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202126405038\nCONMECHYDRO - 2021\nMultiple limits are arranged by creating and regulating the opposite MDC using \nchanging the resistance of the primary winding.
