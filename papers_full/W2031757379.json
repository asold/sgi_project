It is therefore necessary to \ndevelop reliable and effective techniques to provide a \ncomprehensive assessment on transformer condition to \nfacilitate the decision making involving transformer operation \nand maintenance [2-4]. Recently, a health index (HI) method \nhas been proposed for power transformer condition \nassessment. In this approach, it firstly collects a variety of data \nand information from operating observations, field inspections, \nonline and offline measurements and then performs scoring \nand weighting on different measurements and tests results on \nthe basis of utilities practices and related standards (i.e. IEC, \nIEEE and CIGRE recommendations) [5]. Finally, it computes \nan index value regarding the health condition of the \ntransformer under investigation.  \nHowever, the approaches reported in the literature for \ncomputing the health index of in-service transformers still \nsuffer some limitations. For example, the calculated health \nindexes might not be consistent. This is because the scoring \nand weighting in the health index computation are subjective \nin nature (i.e. decided by utility experts) and may vary from \nutility to utility. Moreover, on some occasions it might be \ndifficult to provide an explicit health index on some \ncombinations of data collected from different online and \noffline measurements. To address these limitations, this paper \ndevelops a suite of intelligent algorithms, which utilises the \nhistoric measurement data of oil tests and the insulation \ncondition of corresponding transformer to construct a \nmathematical model to approximate the underlying \nrelationship between oil tests data and transformer insulation \ncondition.  \nThis paper adopts a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) \ntechnique for automatically determining the health index of the \ninsulation system of in-service transformers by using \ntransformer oil characteristic test data. Two key issues of \napplying FSVM to the transformer health index computation \nare addressed in the paper. The first issue is the construction of \na training database which will be utilised by the FSVM \nalgorithm to exploit the underlying relationship between the oil \ntest results and the health index of the transformer insulation \nsystem. The second issue is dealing with the imbalanced \ntraining dataset, in which the number of power transformers \nwith poor insulation condition is limited. Such an imbalanced \ntraining dataset exhibits an unequal distribution between \ndifferent levels of health index and normally have reverse \nimpacts on the performance of FSVM.  \nThe organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 \nprovides a brief introduction of different characteristic tests of \nManuscript received on 18 November 2012, in final form 21 January \n \ntransformer insulating oil. Section 3 describes the procedure of \nconstructing the training dataset for FSVM. Section 4 presents \nthe mathematical formulation and implementation of FSVM \ntechnique for determining the health index of the transformer \noil-paper insulation system. A number of approaches for \ndealing with the effects of class imbalance in the training \ndatabase are also presented in this section.  Section 5 provides \na case study to demonstrate the applicability of the developed \nalgorithms in evaluating a transformer insulation system using \nthe health index. Section 6 concludes the paper. \n2 BRIEF  REVIEW  OF  TRANSFORMER  OIL  \nCHARACTERISTIC  TESTS \nMineral insulating oil is commonly used in power \ntransformers. Ageing and various chemical and electrical \nstresses lead to the separation of molecular bonds of insulating \noil and may generate fragments that can easily interact with \neach other or some external molecules. Consequently, various \ndissolved gases, moisture, acid components and some other \ncontaminants might be formed inside the insulating oil [2]. \nTherefore, routine transformer oil characteristic tests are \nconducted by utilities to reveal the condition of transformer oil \nand the overall insulation system for ensuring the proper \noperation of transformers.   \nAmong oil characteristic tests,  Dissolved Gas Analysis \n(DGA) technique is one of the well-established preventative \nmaintenance tools and its interpretation schemes include \nDoernenburg, Rogers, IEC Ratio, Duval’s Triangle and Single \nGas Ratio method [6]. DGA technique can identify \ntransformer fault conditions such as internal arcing, partial \ndischarge, overheating and hot spots [6]. Other than DGA, \nthere are also a number of physical and chemical oil tests to \nreveal insulation conditions such as moisture test, acidity test, \ndielectric strength test, dielectric dissipation factor test and \nresistivity test [7]. \nIn a transformer the moisture content comes \nfrom the atmosphere or it is produced  due to the deterioration \nof solid insulating material, e.g. paper/pressboard [7]. When \nmoisture content increases beyond the oil saturation level,  free \nwater will be formed and as a result the electrical strength and \nresistivity of insulating oil will decrease [8]. Acids mainly \noriginate from oxidation products in the insulating oil [9]. \nThey can also be produced from atmospheric contamination \n[9]. Together with moisture content and solid contaminants, \nacids and other oxidation products will affect different \nproperties of insulating oil [8]. The dielectric losses in the oil \ncan be measured by dielectric dissipation factor (DDF) test. \nResults obtained from this test are very sensitive to the \npresence of ageing products and  soluble polar contaminants in \nthe insulating oil [8]. Hence, the DDF measurement result is a \ngood indication of the contaminant variations in insulating oil. \nMoreover, oil resistivity measures the degree of losses in the \ninsulating oil and breakdown voltage (BDV) of insulating oil \nmeasures the strength of oil to withstand electrical stress \nwithout any failure [10], [11]. In principle, the condition of \ntransformer insulating oil can be evaluated using the above oil \ncharacteristic tests [12].  \nOn the other hand, various thermal and electrical stresses \nmay also eventually cause the decomposition of cellulose \npaper and lead to the formation of water and carbon oxides \n(CO and CO 2) [2]. Moreover, the paper ageing by-product can \nbe detected through the measurement of 2-furfuraldehyde in \ninsulating oil. Therefore, among the above oil characteristic \ntests, 2-furfuraldehyde test and measurement of dissolved \ncarbon oxides in oil can be used to evaluate the condition of \npaper insulation in a transformer. This paper makes use of the \noil characteristic test results to evaluate the condition of \ntransformer oil-paper insulation and subsequently determine \nthe health index for a transformer insulation system. \n3 COMPREHENSIVE METHOD OF \nCONSTRUCTING TRAINING DATABASE  \nThis paper applies fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) to \ncompute the health index of transformer insulation systems. In \nFSVM, a training database consisting of oil characteristic test \nresults with already known transformer insulation conditions is \nrequired. By using such a database, it is possible for FSVM to \nfind optimal parameters and build up a mathematical model to \npredict a health index for a transformer of interest (this \ntransformer is not in the training database).  \nThis section details the procedure of constructing a training \ndatabase, in which each record consists of the oil characteristic \ntest results of an in-service transformer and its health index. In \nthis paper, the health index is categorized into five different \nlevels by combining the diagnosis results obtained from \nindustry standards, Duval’s triangle method and fuzzy c-means \nalgorithm. Moreover, utility experts’ judgments are also \nincorporated into the health index calculation as a supplement \nto the above three methods.  \n3.1 DETERMINING HEALTH INDEX ON THE BASIS \nOF INDUSTRY STANDARDS (HI 1) \nThis section computes the health index by using a similar \napproach as proposed in [5], which is based on ASTP, IEC \nand IEEE standards and CIGRE recommendations. By \nconsidering different dissolved gas limits recommended by the \nstandards [13, 14], the DGA Factor (DGAF) on determining \nthe health index can be defined as:  \n∑\n∑\n=\n=\n×\n= 7\n1\n7\n1\ni\ni\ni\ni i\nW\nWS\nDGAF \n                                 \n(1) \nwhere i denotes seven dissolved gases (H2, CH 4, C2H 6, C2H 4, \nC 2H 2, CO and CO 2), Si is the score value based on the volume \nof dissolved gases, and W i represents the weighting factor of \neach individual dissolved gas [5].  \nSimilarly, by considering the oil test limits recommended by \nIEEE, ASTM and IEC [15, 16], the Oil Quality Factor (OQF) \non determining the health index can be defined as: \n \n∑\n∑\n=\n=\n×\n= 4\n1\n4\n1\ni\ni\ni\ni i\nW\nWS\nOQF \n                                  \n(2) \nwhere i denotes four oil tests (BDV, acidity, moisture content \nand DDF), Si is the score based on the value of oil test results \nand W i represents the weighting factor of each individual oil \ntest [5]. Moreover, the Paper Insulation Factor (PIF) on \ndetermining the health index is defined based on the amount of \nfurfural content of the insulating oil, which can be traced using \nIEC 61198 [17]. Table 1 shows the PIF values based on their \nlevel of furfural content. In the case of the transformer oil \nhaving been changed, the information by 2-furfuraldehyde test \ncannot determine the paper degradation; therefore, PIF \nreceives a low weighting value in the final Health Index \ncalculation using Equation 3. \n \nTable 1. 2-furfuraldehyde test rating [5]. \nRating Code \n     Concentration \n            [ppm] \n1 0-0.1 \n2 0.1 -0.5  \n3 0.5 -1 \n4 1-5 \n5 >5 \nFinally, the above three factors, i.e. DGAF, OQF, and PIF \nare combined into a single health index as defined by Equation \n3:   \n∑\n∑\n=\n=\n×\n= 3\n1\n3\n1\n1\nj\ni\nj\ni i\nK\nKF\nHI \n                              \n(3) \nwhere Fi represents factor values of DGAF, OQF and PIF. \nK i values for DGAF, OQF and PIF are 10, 8 and 4 respectively \nwhich are decided based on the importance and reliability of \ndiagnosis techniques included in each factor (Fi). \n The health index value obtained from Equation 3 is \nnormalized into five levels from level 1 to level 5, which \ncorrespond to excellent, good, fair, poor and unsatisfactory \nconditions of a transformer insulation system.  \n3.2 DETERMINING HEALTH INDEX ON THE BASIS \nOF UTILITY EXPERTS’ JUDGEMENTS (HI 2) \nAlong with oil characteristic tests results, utility experts \nhave access to further information regarding the transformer \nunder investigation. The information may include loading \nhistory, operating conditions (temperature and weather \nconditions), maintenance history and the information obtained \nfrom a visual inspection. Moreover, the utility experts have \nwell-established knowledge and expertise to analyse every \npiece of information to make an assessment on the condition of \na transformer. \nIn this paper the oil test records provided by the utility are \naccompanied with utility expert comments on the condition of \neach transformer. In order to incorporate expert advice into the \nhealth index, this paper quantifies expert comments into five \ndifferent levels of excellent, good, fair, poor and unsatisfactory \nregarding insulation conditions of a transformer.   \n3.3 DETERMINING HEALTH INDEX ON THE BASIS \nOF DGA INTERPRETATION RESULTS (HI 3) \nDGA is one of the most important tools for transformer fault \ndiagnosis. Its interpretation methods include Dornenburg \nRatios, Rogers Ratios, Duval’s Triangle and IEC/IEEE \nstandards.  In the authors previous study, it has been found that \nthe Duval’s Triangle could attain a higher diagnosis accuracy \ncompared to other methods [6]. In this paper, the DGA data of \neach oil test record was evaluated by Duval’s Triangle method.  \nAccording to the faults identified by Duval’s Triangle method, \nthe corresponding transformer insulation condition (health \nindex) is quantified into five levels, from level one of excellent \ncondition to level five of severe condition as shown in Table 2. \n \nTable 2. Duval triangle rating. \nRating Code  (HI 3) Fault detected by Duval Triangle method  \n1 Normal \n2 Normal but high TCG  \n3 D1, T1  \n4 PD, T2  \n5 D2,T3 \nNote: TCG: T otal C ombustible G ases , D1: discharge of low energy, D2: discharge of high \nenergy, T1: low thermal fault, T2: medium thermal fault, T3: high thermal fault, PD: Partial \nDischarge .\n3.4 DETERMINING HEALTH INDEX USING FUZZY C-\nMEANS ALGORITHM (HI 4) \n  Due to measurement errors and influences from any \nenvironmental interference, there may exist a certain degree of \ninaccuracy to oil tests data (i.e. noises). This may cause a \ndiscrepancy among the above three sets of health indices, \nwhich are determined by industry standards, expert judgements \nand Duval’s Triangle respectively.  \nTo deal with noisy data and to assure the consistency of the \nhealth index calculated by different methods, this paper adopts \nthe Fuzzy C -Means (FCM) algorithm to investigate which \nextent that each oil test record belongs to one particular health \nindex (i.e. health index from level one to level five).    \n FCM is an unsupervised clustering method, in which data \ncan belong to more than one cluster (group) with different \nmembership values. The membership value indicates the \nconfidence of the association between that data and a \nparticular cluster [18]. Fuzzy clustering is a process of \nassigning these membership levels and then using them to \nassign data elements to one or more clusters [18]. In this \npaper, FCM is used to calculate membership values for each \noil test record with respect to each of the five clusters (each \ncluster corresponds to one health index level). Then FCM \nassigns the above test record to the cluster, to which this \nrecord has the highest membership value.   \n3.5 ASSIGNING FINAL HEALTH INDEX AND \nFORMING THE TRAINING DATABASE (HI)  \nAfter obtaining four sets of health index based on industry \nstandard, Duval’s Triangle method, Fuzzy C -means algorithm  \n \n \n \nTable 3.

Since the four \nmethods compute the health index based on different criteria, \nthere may exist discrepancies among different methods.  To \ndeal with such possible discrepancies, the majority vote \nstrategy is adopted for deciding the final health index level.  \nTable 3 exemplifies the determination of final health index for \nthe insulation system of ten in-service transformers. \nIt can be seen from Table 3 that the health index ranked by \nfour assessment criteria are consistent for health index level \none (excellent condition) and level two (good condition). For \nexample, FCM assigns the related records (data) into these two \nhealth index levels with a high membership value (94%, and \n93% in Level one, 54% and 70% in Level Two) and Duval’s \nTriangle identifies the transformers are in normal condition. \nThus the determinations of final health index for health index \nlevel one and two are straightforward. It can also be seen that \nfor health index level three, four assessment criteria only have \na slight discrepancy.     \nCorrectly determining health index levels four and five for \ntransformer insulation system is crucial since these two health \nindex levels indicate the faults are occurring in a transformer \ninsulation system and immediate action needs to be taken. As \nshown in Table 3, transformers 7 to 10 are assigned with a \nhealth index of level four or five based on both industry \nstandards  criteria and utilities expert judgements. Duval’s \nTriangle also reveals these four transformers may have either \nmedium to high temperature overheat or partial discharge or \ndischarge of high energy faults. However, FCM could not \nmake explicit determination of the health index level for these \nfour transformers. Based on the majority vote, transformers 7 \nand 8 are assigned with health index level four since three out \nof four criteria indicate the health index level is at four. \nSimilarly, transformers 9 and 10 are assigned with health index \nlevel five since three out of four criteria indicate the health \nindex level is five. \nThe above procedure of determining the health index level \nfor a transformer insulation system is applied to 181 power \ntransformers to form the training database. Table 4 presents \nthe distribution of health index levels of this database. This \ndatabase will be used for training the FSVM algorithm, which \ncan then automatically determine the health index. \nTable 4.

This section starts with the introduction of support \nvector machine (SVM) and then presents the key ideas behind \nFSVM. Since the training database as shown in Table 4 is \nimbalanced (e.g. the transformers with health index level five \nare outnumbered by transformers with other health index \nlevels) a number of pre-processing approaches are also \nimplemented in this section.   \n4.1 SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)  \nOn the basis of a statistical learning principle, the SVM is \none of the commonly adopted machine learning techniques for \ndata classification [19, 20]. The SVM makes use of a training \ndatabase, which is a collection of samples and each sample \nconsists of a number of features. In this paper, each feature \ncorresponds to a particular oil test result.  Moreover, each \nsample in the above training database has been labelled with a \ntarget value (i.e. health index level), which is decided by \nindustry standard, utility expert judgment, Duval’s Triangle \nand Fuzzy c-means algorithm (refer to Section 3). Using this \ntraining database SVM will build up a mathematical model \nthat can later be applied to determine the health index for the \ninsulating system of an in-service transformer solely based on \nits oil characteristic test results. In general, the samples in the \n \ntraining database can be represented as X =[x\n1,…,xl] and each \nsample belongs to one of the K  independent categories (health \nindex levels) [ y1,…, yK ]. Making use of the training dataset, the \nSVM is tasked to construct a hyperplane (model) to separate \nthe samples into different categories. Such hyperplane (model) \nwill later be used to classify any new sample into one of the \nabove categories (health index levels).  \nTo find the optimal separation hyperplane that maximizes \nthe margin between different categories of samples in SVM \nalgorithm, the samples are mapped into a higher dimensional \nfeature space. The margin maximization is then formulated as \na quadratic programming (QP) problem [19]:   \n∑\n=\n+\nl\ni\ni\nT\nb w\nC\n1, , 2\n1Min ξ\nξ\nww  \ns.t.  ,1))(( ii\nT\ni by ξφ −≥+xw   . 0≥iξ\n  \nli ,..., 1=           (4) \nIn Equation 4, function Ø  maps the training samples xi into \na higher dimensional space. The separation hyperplane is \ndefined by ( w ,b) . The slack variable ξi > 0 is an indication of \nmisclassification error. Parameter C  in Equation 4 controls the \ntrade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the \nnumber of misclassifications. The above QP problem can be \ntransformed into its dual form with the  introduction of  the \nLagrange multipliers αi [19]. \n) ( ).

To deal with noises and outliers in the training \ndataset, a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) is applied in \nthis paper. In FSVM the samples are assigned with different \nweights; the sample closer to the centre of its belonging class \nis assigned with a higher weight [21]. FSVM is formulated as \nfollows [22]:  \n∑\n=\n+\nl\ni\ni i\nT\nb w\nC\n1, , 2\n1Min ξ ρ\nξ\nww  \ns.t.  ,1))(( ii\nT\ni by ξφ −≥+xw   . 0≥iξ\n         \n(7) \n    where the original training dataset becomes { xi, yi, ρi}, \ni=1,…,l, and ρi (0 < ρi< 1) are the weights. The dual form \nequation for FSVM with the Lagrange multipliers αi can be \ncalculated as [22]: \n) ( ).

This can be achieved by calculating the Euclidean \nmean of the samples of each class. After obtaining the  centres \nof each class in  the training dataset, the sample weight ρ(xi) \ncan be calculated by using  an exponentially decaying function \n[22]: \n,)exp( 1\n2)( cen \ni\ni\ndβρ +=x         ] 1 , 0 [∈β\n          \n(9) \nwhere di\ncen  =|| xi – ci || 1/2  is the Euclidean distance between \nthe sample xi and its cluster center ci. In this equation β \ndetermines the steepness of the decay. \n4.3 PRE-PROCESSING METHODS FOR DEALING \nWITH CLASS IMBALANCE \nThe training database (Table 4) exhibits an unequal \ndistribution between different classes (health index levels); the \nsamples in health index level five are significantly \noutnumbered by the samples in other health index levels.  Such \nphenomenon is called a class imbalance problem and may lead \nto biased classification. This paper implements three data pre-\nprocessing methods namely over-sampling, under-sampling \nand Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling technique (SMOTE) to \ndeal with class imbalance problems in the training database. \nThese three methods will be integrated with SVM and FSVM \nfor determining the health index. \n4.3.1 OVER-SAMPLING \nOver-sampling changes the samples distribution in the \ntraining dataset by duplicating the samples with the higher cost \nof misclassification.  The duplication process is a random \nover-sampling with replacement and it will be repeated until \nthe numbers of different training samples are proportional to \ntheir costs of misclassification. For a classification problem \nwith K  classes, the function Cost [i, c ] ( i=1,… K , c=1,… K ) \nrepresents the cost of misclassifying a sample of the i-th class \nto the c-th class. The overall misclassification cost of each \nclass can be calculated as follows [23]: \n∑\n=\n=\nC\nc\nc iCost iCost \n1\n] , [] [                        (10) \nAfter calculating the misclassification cost of each class, the \nnumber of training samples *\nkN in the k-th class after \nresampling can be decided as [23]: \n\n\n\n\n\n=\nλ\nλ NCost \nkCost N k\n] [\n] [*                         (11) \nwhere λ  refers to the class which has the smallest number of \ntraining samples to be duplicated and it can be identified as \n[23]: \nj\ncCost \nc\nj N\nNcCost \njCost \nc\n] [min arg \n] [min \n] [\nmin arg =λ             (12) \nIf N *\nk > N k (N k is the sample number of k-th class before \noversampling), then ( N *\nk - N k) number of training samples in \n \nthe k-th class should be re-sampled [23]. \n4.3.2 \n UNDER-SAMPLING \nUnder-sampling modifies the training sample distribution by \ndeleting some training samples with lower costs of \nmisclassification. This process will continue until the sample \nnumber of different classes is proportional to their costs of \nmisclassification. As in the over-sampling, the k-th class will \nhave N\n*\nk training samples after re-sampling. This can be \ncomputed according to Equation 11. However, λ refers to the \nclass which has the smallest number of training samples to be \nremoved [23]: \nj\ncCost \nc\nj N\nNcCost \njCost \nc\n] [max arg \n] [max \n] [\nmax arg =λ           (13) \nIf N *\nk < N k (N k is the number of k-th class before under-\nsampling),  then ( N k - N *\nk) training samples in the k-th class \nshould be removed [23]. \n4.3.3  SYNTHETIC MINORITY OVER-SAMPLING \nTECHNIQUE (SMOTE) [24] \nSMOTE algorithm adopts a hybrid approach, which \nperforms over-sampling on the minority classes and under-\nsampling on the majority classes. It over-samples minority \nclasses by keeping all the original samples and generating \nsynthetic samples to join the minority classes. The procedure \nof generating synthetic samples for the minority class can be \nsummarized as follows: (1) finding k-nearest neighbours for \neach sample in the minority class; (2) for an individual \nminority sample randomly selecting j samples from its k-\nnearest neighbours based on the amount of total samples \nrequired; (3) generating the synthetic samples along the line \nsegments connecting the minority sample and its j neighbours; \n(4) adding the new samples to the dataset. The advantage of \nSMOTE’s over-sampling over random over-sampling is that \nthe decision region for the minority classes is larger and less \nspecific. This helps to avoid the over fitting problem. On the \nother hand, in SMOTE the sample number of the majority \nclasses will be reduced by the under-sampling method using \nEquations 10, 11 and 13. \n5 NUMERIC RESULTS AND ANALYSIS \nThis section presents the numeric results of applying FSVM \nalgorithm to determine the health index of a transformer \ninsulation system. In this section, the dataset preparation, \nnumeric simulation setup and the performance of a variety of \nalgorithms is presented.   \n5.1 TRAINING DATABASE ANALYSIS   \nAs mentioned earlier in this paper , the training database \n(Table 4) exhibits imbalanced class distributions; the samples \nin the health index level One and Two (excellent and good \ncondition) outnumbers the samples in the health index levels \nthree, four, and five (fair, poor and unsatisfactory conditions).  \nHealth index level five only has ten records. However, such a \nphenomenon is not unusual since the faulty rate of a \ntransformer is rather low. As discussed in the previous section, \nthis paper will adopt under-sampling, over-sampling and \nSMOTE approaches to deal with the class imbalanced \nproblem. \nOn the other hand, due to the imprecise nature of \nmeasurement equipment and environmental noises, the \ninsulating oil test data may have considerably high levels of \noutliers. Figure 1 illustrates the oil test and DGA test data \ndistribution of the training database. It can be seen that some \noil test data have considerably high outliers where the outliers \nare named based on their transformer ID. The outliers are far \naway from other data and may have reverse impacts on the \nclassification performance of SVM. This paper applies FSVM \nalgorithm, which assigns different weights to the samples. The \noutliers are far away from their class centres and will be \nassigned with lower weights in FSVM. It is expected that the \nintroduction of sample weights will improve the classification \naccuracy. This will be proven in the next Section.  \n \nFigure 1.  Distribution of transformer oil tests data in training database. \n5.2 NUMERIC EXPERIMENT SET-UP \nIn the numeric experiment, SVM and FSVM algorithms and \nSVM and FSVM algorithms integrated with the three data pre-\nprocessing methods (under-sampling, over-sampling and \nSMOTE), a total of eight algorithms are implemented and \nevaluated. These eight algorithms are: SVM, SVM with under-\nsampling, SVM with over-sampling, SVM with SMOTE, \nFSVM, FSVM with under-sampling, FSVM with over-\nsampling and FSVM with SMOTE. In the algorithmic \nimplementation, Libsvm software package has been used with \nthe necessary modification and extension [25].   \n   In the numeric experiment, the original database of 181 oil \ntest records is randomly split into two parts of a training \ndataset and a testing dataset for validating the classification \naccuracy of the above eight algorithms, where 70% of samples \nof the original dataset considered for the training dataset and \nthe remaining 30% for the testing dataset.  \n \nThe radial-basis function (RBF) kernel \n( ) ( )\n2\n,\nj i\neK j i\nx x\nx x\n−−\n=\nγ is adopted in  eight algorithms. Tenfold \ncross validations are conducted on the training dataset to \ndecide the optimal values for the pair of (C, γ ),  where C  is the \nregularization parameter in SVM and FSVM to balance the \nmargin maximization and misclassification and γ is the \nvariance parameter of RBF kernel [25]. The obtained optimal \npair of ( C , γ) of each individual algorithm is then used to train \nthe algorithm on the whole training dataset. Finally, the trained \nalgorithms are applied to compute the health index level for \nthe transformers in the testing dataset. It is worthy to point out \nthat the data is scaled to [-1, 1] interval before running any \nalgorithm. The above dataset split, cross-validation and testing \nwill be repeated 10 times for each of the eight algorithms. \n5.3 NUMERIC EXPERIMENT RESULTS \nThe numeric experiment results of SVM, SVM integrated \nwith pre-processing methods, FSVM and FSVM integrated \nwith pre-processing methods are summarized in Tables 5 and \n6.  Three different types of algorithm performance measures \nare investigated in this paper, which   include the averaged \nclassification accuracy on the testing dataset, the best \nclassification accuracy on the testing dataset and the averaged \nclassification accuracy for each class in the testing dataset.    \nIt can be seen from Table 5 that SVM integrated with the \ndifferent data pre-processing method attained different \nclassification accuracy. SVM integrated with the under-\nsampling method attained the lowest classification accuracy on \nthe testing dataset compared to the original SVM algorithm \n(i.e. the SVM without the integration with any pre-processed \nmethods). The  under-sampling method is originally applied to \nthe  binary (two-class) classification problems  [24]. However, \nthis numeric experiment deals with a multiple class (five \nclasses) dataset and has high sample population variations \namong different classes. This may lead to the undesirable \nclassification accuracy of the SVM integrated with the under-\nsampling method. \nOn the other hand, the SVM integrated with the over-\nsampling method and SMOTE technique attained much better \nclassification accuracy. As can be seen from Table 5, the \naverage classification accuracy on the testing dataset of SVM \nintegrated with over-sampling increased to 85% from 82% of \nthe original SVM. The SVM integrated with SMOTE also \nsignificantly improves the classification accuracy on the \ntesting dataset to about 86% from 82% of the original SVM. \nTable 6 presents the classification accuracy obtained from \nFSVM algorithm with and without the integration of different \ndata pre-processing methods. It can be seen that the FSVM \nintegrating with the under sampling data pre-processing \nmethod has lower classification accuracy compared to the \noriginal FSVM (i.e. the FSVM without the integration with \nany pre-processing methods). Thus, it can be concluded that \nthe under sampling method cannot effectively deal with the \nclass imbalance problem and improve the classification \naccuracy of both SVM and FSVM algorithms in this numeric \nexperiment. However, the FSVM integrated with over-\nsampling and SMOTE methods attained higher classification \naccuracy compared to the original FSVM. The FSVM \nintegrated with the SMOTE method attains the highest \nclassification accuracy among seven algorithms in this case \nstudy, its overall averaged classification accuracy on the \ntesting dataset is 87.8 %.  \nIt can also be observed from Tables 5 and 6 that FSVM \noutperforms SVM. The averaged classification accuracy of the \noriginal SVM is 82.2% while that of the original FSVM is \n84.1%. FSVM integrated SMOTE also attains higher \nclassification accuracy than SVM integrated with SMOTE \ndoes. The better performance of FSVM is due to its capability \nin dealing with outliers in the training dataset. \nTables 5 and 6 show that the classification accuracies of the \nsamples for health index level five are lower than the \nclassification accuracies for the rest of the health index levels. \nThis is due to the small sample size of health index level five, \nwhich has only ten samples.  As described in Table 4, the \nsamples in health index level five correspond to the \ntransformers with the critical conditions of their insulation \nsystem. And in the utilities the chance of having transformers \nwith critical conditions of insulation system is relatively rare, \nthus only a few pieces of data are collected in this paper. \nHowever, SVM-SMOTE and FSVM-SMOTE still can \nimprove the classification accuracy on the samples of health \nindex level five to some extent. From the above discussions, it \ncan be found that the SVM and FSVM integrated with over-\nsampling and SMOTE could attain classification accuracy \nabove 85%. This demonstrates the applicability of the \nintelligent algorithms based on SVM and FSVM approaches \nfor determining the health index of a transformer insulation \nsystem. \nTable 5.

The health index approach intends to \nimprove the quality of condition assessment of the transformer \ninsulation system by combining results from various chemical \nand electrical tests, onsite inspections, and information \nregarding the transformer’s operation and loading history. A \ncase study using a real dataset with oil quality tests and DGA \ntest records for 181 in-service power transformers is provided. \nThe case study demonstrates the applicability of the developed \nintelligent algorithms in determining the health index of the \noil-paper insulation system of the in-service transformers. The \nresults illustrate that the FSVM integrated with SMOTE pre-\nprocessing method could attain the highest classification \naccuracy. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Z. Xiang and E.
