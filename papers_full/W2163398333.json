INTRODUCTION\nT\nODAY’S competitive market drives utilities more and\nmore to the use of the available instead of the intended\nlifetime of a HV component. In principle, this option may\nbe within the bounds of the conservative design of the HV\nconstruction, however, in the end it may be counteracted by\nlong term aging processes of the electrical insulation system. A\npredisposition for such a failure mode can be very minor, e.g.,\na material irregularity introduced during manufacture. Due to\nits inactivity in the beginning of service life of a transformer,\nthe defect passes detection for a long time, until operational\nstresses accelerate detrimental growth. Considering the damage\nthat can be caused by a failing insulation system, it is important\nto develop diagnostic methods which recognize a so-called\nhidden fault as soon as its activity increases [1].\nToday, utilities have to adapt to a lot of changing technical\nand economical requirements in industrialized countries [2], [3].\nDeregulation measures have created an increasingly competi-\ntive working environment which has to lead to a more cost-ef-\nfective power delivery system. Also, more high voltage installa-\ntions have reached a service life of over 35 years, so the fraction\nof equipment in the terminative stage increases. Additionally,\nthe preservation of maintenance expertise will become impor-\ntant in case the experts retire.

In general, the utilities\nare driven to redesign their maintenance approach by three pri-\nmary factors:\n• the need for cost reduction;\n• lifetime extension;\n• increasing liability awareness.\nTo meet these challenges, the electrical power branch in the\nNetherlands is now making the transition from the usual cor-\nrective (at failure) and time based strategies toward condition\nbased maintenance. This need for condition based maintenance\nhas encouraged the development of adaptable and cost-effective\ndiagnostics. For HV transformers in addition to regular mea-\nsurements like gas in oil analysis, several measuring tools have\nbeen introduced: dielectric measurements like RVM, relaxation\ncurrent, tangens\n, and partial discharge patterns [4]\n(Fig. 1).\nII. FACTORS INFLUENCING THE Q UALITY OF\nTRANSFORMER INSULATION\nThe aspects of aging in an electrical insulation system (EIS)\nhave generated a lot of attention. The IEC TC 98 working group\n0885-8977/02$17.00 © 2002 IEEE\nV AN BOLHUIS et al.: MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC OF TRANSFORMER SOLID INSULATION 529\nFig. 2. Aging of an EIS [5].\nis considering the evaluation of EIS and, in particular, the influ-\nence of aging upon EIS.\nIn Section II-A “General aspects of aging,”part of the ap-\nproach of the TC 98 is given because the general aspects are\nalso applicable to the EIS of transformers.\nA. General Aspects of Aging [5]\nThe insulation system of a transformer consists mostly of oil\nand paper which are subject to aging. Aging is defined as the\nirreversible changes of the properties of an electrical insulation\nsystem (EIS) due to action of one or more factors of influence.\nAging stresses may cause either intrinsic or extrinsic aging. In\nmost EIS, extrinsic aging predominates because, in practice,\nthey include imperfections and contaminants. A schematic rep-\nresentation of the basic process is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe type and level of contamination and/or the extent of im-\nperfections in an EIS will significantly affect the service per-\nformance. In general, the fewer and less severe the contami-\nnant and/or defects in the EIS, the better the performance of the\nequipment.\nThe aging factors produce electrical, thermal, mechanical, or\nenvironmental aging mechanisms that eventually lead to failure.\nDuring aging applied stresses, which initially may not affect the\nEIS, can come aging factors that, as a result, modify the rate of\ndegradation.\nWhen aging is dominated by one aging factor, this is referred\nto as single-factor aging. Multifactor aging occurs when more\nthan one aging factor substantially affects the performance of\nthe EIS. Aging factors may act synergistically, that is, there may\nbe direct interactions between the stresses. Interaction may be\npositive or negative.\nThe aging of a practical EIS can be complex and failure is\nusually caused by a combination of aging mechanisms, even\nthough there may be only one dominant aging factor [5] (see\nFigs. 3 and 4).\nBased on the study as given in [5] for consideration of trans-\nformer insulation, the following factors are important.\n1) Thermal Aging [5]:Thermal aging involves the progress\nof chemical and physical changes as a consequence of chemical\ndegradation reactions, polymerization, depolymerization, diffu-\nsions, etc. It also involves the thermomechanical effects caused\nby the forces due to thermal expansion and/or contraction.\nThe rate of thermal aging and the aging caused by thermome-\nchanical effects, as far as chemical reactions are concerned, are\nvery much influenced by the operating temperature.\nFig. 3. Example of possible aging mechanisms as a function of time [5].\nFig. 4. Aging as a function of time for the example in Fig. 3 [5].\n2) Electrical Aging [5]:Electrical aging, either AC, DC, or\nimpulse, involves the following:\n• the effects of partial discharges when the local field\nstrength exceeds the breakdown strength in liquid or\ngaseous dielectric adjacent to, or included in, the EIS;\n• the effects of tracking;\n• the effects of treeing;\n• the effects of electrolysis;\n• the effects, related to those above, on the adjacent surfaces\nof two insulation materials where tangential fields of rel-\natively high value may occur;\n• the effects of increased temperatures produced by high\ndielectric losses;\n• the effect of space charges.\nElectrical aging is influenced by the field strength.\n3) Mechanical Aging [5]:Mechanical aging involves the\nfollowing:\n• fatigue failure of insulation components caused by a large\nnumber of low-level stress cycles;\n• thermomechanical effects caused by thermal expansion\nand or contraction;\n• rupture of insulation by high levels of mechanical stress\nsuch as may be caused by external forces or operation\ncondition of the equipment;\n530 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY , VOL. 17, NO. 2, APRIL 2002\n• abrasive wear caused by relative motion between equip-\nment components;\n• insulation creep or flow under electrical, thermal, or me-\nchanical stresses.\nMechanical aging is influenced by the rate of occurrence of\nrepetitive mechanical stresses and the magnitude of nonrepet-\nitive stresses.\n4) Environmental Aging [5]:Environmental aging involves\nthe chemical reaction processes mentioned under thermal aging.\nEnvironmental factors may also influence, in various ways, the\nkind and degree of degradation caused by other stresses to which\nan EIS is exposed. Other important aspects are the redistribution\nof stresses by changes in the environment and the influences\nof dust and other contamination on electrical behavior. At the\npresent time there are no documented general rules for corre-\nlating the acceleration factors relating to environmental aging.\nB. Aging in the Transformer Insulation System\n1) Winding Insulation:Most windings in large power\ntransformers consist of paper wrapped insulation on the\nwindings. The paper is prepared from wood pulp and contains\n90% cellulose. The latter is a natural polymer of glucose and\nconsists of around 1200 monomer units once in its paper form.\nThere is some destruction of the structure during manufac-\nture, winding, and processing. Paper on a new transformer\nwould start with an average chain length, in monomer units\nor degree of polymerization (DP) of around 1000. Laboratory\nexperiments [6], [7] showed that over most of the aging range\nthere is a linear relationship between time and the logarithm\nof the chain length. The aging rate is enhanced by increasing\ntemperature, increasing moisture, and presence of air (oxygen)\n[8]. The strength of paper, in turn, is critically dependant\nupon the DP. For DPs of between 1000 and 500 the strength\nis virtually constant, but in the range 500 to 200 the strength\nis directly related to DP [6]. At a value of\nand\nbelow, the strength is inadequate to withstand any winding\nmovement [9]. The influence of temperature on the rate at\nwhich paper degrades is most commonly taken as Fabre and\nPichon’s ten degree rule—where the life halves for every\n10\nC increase in temperature [7]. The same workers [6], [7]\nshowed that aging under air rather than vacuum introduces\nan additional acceleration factor of 2.5. The role of moisture\nis more complex. Water may enter the transformer from the\noutside, but it is also produced by the degradation process\nitself—the greater the degree of degradation, the greater the\nrate of moisture production. Dry paper may have a moisture\ncontent of 0.5%; but the rate of degradation when the paper has\n4% moisture is 20 times greater [10].\nSome rating guides will use a 70\nC, 40 year life criterion and\napply the 10C rule to trade overload periods with times op-\nerating at less than 70C. The latter temperature relates to the\nrating ascribed to the design during a factory heat run. Since\ntransmission units will generally operate at less than 70\nC for\nmost of their lives, a longer life before aging occurs can be ex-\npected than for generation units [10].\nExperience in the U.K. [10], Australia [11], and the U.S. [12]\nindicates that even after 40 years of service the aging of trans-\nmission units is generally consistent with midlife. The excep-\nTABLE I\nSOME FAULTS W ITH C ORRESPONDING K EY G ASES\ntions arise where there have been hot spots at design specific\nareas. Early deterioration of the general winding insulation was\nfound where moisture ingress had occurred. Reference [12] re-\nlates the relatively slight aging in 40 year old U.S. transformers\nbut contrasts with 10 to 13 year old units where the oil had been\nallowed to sludge. Here, paper had reached DP values of 150 and\nthe end of life. Therefore, for oil/paper systems, it is essential\nfor designers and operators to maintain low moisture content.\n2) Oil Insulation:The essential requirement for the oil is to\nmaintain dielectric performance in the oil gaps and across solid\nsurfaces, to age very slowly, and to have adequate thermal and\nviscosity properties to achieve factory heat run performance. A\nlow quality oil, or one with a poor aging rate, is often associ-\nated with low transformer lives. The use of additives can allow\na poorer oil to achieve adequate initial properties for perfor-\nmance. Hence, if used, the additive content must be monitored\nand maintained, since the loss of property values can be very\nrapid [10].\nIII. M\nEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES\nThis section will describe eight often used/mentioned diag-\nnostic techniques for evaluating the transformer insulation. A\nshort summary of the techniques, their status of development,\nfield of application, and type of users can be found in Table II.\nA. Gas in Oil Analysis\nDielectric oil [13] and solid cellulose dielectric materials will\ndegrade and break down under thermal and electrical stresses.\nThis process will produce gases in varying composition and in\nconcentrations relating to the severity of the stresses applied to\nthese materials. These gases will dissolve in the oil. The nature\nand concentrations of the gases sampled and analyzed are in-\ndicative of the type and severity of the fault in the transformer.\nThe changes in the production of each gas and their rate of pro-\nduction are important factors in determining the type of fault(s)\ninvolved and of the evolution of the fault(s). Some specific gases\nare recognized as being indicative of certain types of faults.\nDegradation of oil, be it due to overheating of the oil, partial\ndischarge or arcing, will produce hydrogen, methane, ethane,\nethylene, and acetylene. With each fault type, key gases are as-\nsociated. The production of these gases and their rate of produc-\ntion are in direct relation to the materials involved, the temper-\nature, and the energy released at the fault location.\nThermal degradation of oil-impregnated cellulose will pro-\nduce carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide [13]. Table I and\nFig. 5 show the key gases for several faults.\nV AN BOLHUIS et al.: MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC OF TRANSFORMER SOLID INSULATION 531\nTABLE II\nEIGHT O FTEN U SED /M ENTIONED M EASUREMENT TECHNIQUES W ITH U SE ,D EVELOPMENTS ,STATUS ,AND A PPLICATION\nFig. 5. Examples of key gases for typical faults.\nUsually, an oil sample is taken collected from the transformer\nand analyzed using DGA.\nThe DGA is performed in the following three steps:\n1) extraction of all the gases in the oil sample;\n2) measurement of the quantity of each gas in the extracted\ngas;\n3) calculation of the concentration of each gas in the oil\nsample.\nThe most commonly measured gases are: oxygen, nitrogen,\nhydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethane,\nethylene (or ethene), acetylene (or ethyne). Other extracted\ngases are sometimes analyzed, such as C\nH ,C H ,C H\nrefine a diagnostic. However this approach is not widely used.\nInstead of taking periodical samples online, gas-in-oil moni-\ntors are commercially available that measure the concentration\nof nine different gases (hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene,\nacetylene, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, C\nH , and CH ).\nA high degree of success has been achieved in the area of\ndetermining a link between the following: 1) ratios of common\nfault gas concentration and specific fault types and 2) the evolu-\ntion of individual fault gases and the nature and severity of the\ntransformer fault.\nThe most commonly used gas-in-oil diagnostic methods in-\nclude the following:\n• IEEE C57.104-1991;\n• Doernenburg;\n• Rogers;\n• IEC 599;\n• Duval;\n• GE.\nB. Degree of Polymerization\nThe measurement of the degree of polymerization is intended\nto determine the condition of the paper winding insulation.\nPaper samples are taken from the transformer and the degree\n532 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY , VOL. 17, NO. 2, APRIL 2002\nFig. 6. Parameters for a recovery voltage measurement.\nof polymerization, i.e., the average length of the cellulose\nchains, is determined by measuring the tensile strength of the\nsamples [14]. New paper has an average chain length of 1000\n[10] to 1500 [14]. After an extended period of service at high\ntemperature in an oil with a high content of water and oxygen,\nthe paper becomes brittle, changes color to brown, and its\ndegree of polymerization falls to 150 [10], [14]. A drawback\nof this method is that, in order to take a paper sample, the\ntransformer tank must be opened. Furthermore, there is no\nguarantee that the sample taken from a certain location of the\npaper winding is representative of the complete winding [14].\nC. Furfural\nThermal degradation of cellulose paper also results in genera-\ntion of furane (C\nH O—a colorless, water insoluble liquid) and\nvarious other furane derivates (for ease, furane and its derivates\nwill be called furfural in the rest of this paper). Measurement of\nthe furfural content of the oil can be used for a bulk measure-\nment of the degree of polymerization of the paper insulation [8],\n[14], [15].\nD. Recovery Voltage Measurement (RVM)\nThe rate of paper degradation depends on several parame-\nters. The principal parameters are type of papers, pulp composi-\ntion, thermal upgrading, moisture content, and temperature. The\nhigher the water content of the paper, the higher the degradation\nrate. The RVM technique uses the dielectric response of the in-\nsulation to evaluate the condition of the insulation with respect\nto moisture content and aging [16]–[19].\nThe principle of RVM is shown in Fig. 6. First a sample is\ncharged for a time\n. Then, the sample is isolated from the HV\nsource and short-circuited for a time . At the end of\ntime , the short-circuit is removed and the return voltage ap-\npearing at the electrodes can be measured. Three characteristic\nparameters of the return voltage can be defined. They are: the\nmaximum of the return voltage, the time at which the max-\nimum is reached , and the initial slope of the return voltage\n[20].\nBy plotting the value for(and, additionally forand\n) for increasing charge time(with constant ) a po-\nlarization spectrum can be obtained.\nThe maximum in that polarization spectrum is called the\ndominant time constant.\nThe technique measures the dielectric polarization in oil–\npaper insulation. Impurities, such as moisture, aging products,\netc., tend to collect at the interfaces between the components of\nFig. 7. RVM spectra for three transformers of different age [22].\nFig. 8. Influence of moisture on the RVM spectrum [21].\nthe insulation and increase the electrical conductance at the in-\nterface. The increased conductivity in turn enhances interfacial\npolarization in the composite dielectric [16].\nIf the condition of the oil–paper insulation is homogeneous,\nthat is, if the distribution of the temperature, moisture, aging\nbyproducts, etc., in the insulation is uniform, the resulting\ncurves have one dominant time constant, because the dominant\ntime constant and the intensity of elementary polarization have\nuniform values (see Figs. 7 and 8) [21], [22].\nA reciprocal method for measuring the polarization at inter-\nfaces is the relaxation current method [23], but the RVM method\nseems to be less influenced by disturbances, so may be better\nsuited for application in the field [21], [24], [25].\nE. Tangens Delta\nThe Tangens delta [14], [26] is a property of the electrical\ninsulation system and a measure of the electrical losses in the\ninsulation. Low values of tangens delta are usually required as\nproof of quality of the insulation. Sudden increases in value of\ntangens delta over time, are taken as a sign of deterioration of\nthe insulation condition.\nPortable instruments have been developed for field measure-\nments of the tangens delta at a test voltage of 10 to 12 kV . The\ndielectric stress applied to the examined insulation during mea-\nsurements at 10 to 12 kV is much lower than the rated voltage,\nnevertheless, such measurements have gained popularity since\nthey can be conveniently performed in a substation, and a com-\nparison of readings taken on the same unit at regular time inter-\nvals effectively reveals a deterioration of the insulation dielec-\ntric properties [14].\nV AN BOLHUIS et al.: MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC OF TRANSFORMER SOLID INSULATION 533\nFig. 9. Tangens/100/101 /108/116 /97 /40 /102 /41 measurement at different voltages on the insulation\nof a current transformer [20].\nF . Insulation Resistance Test and Polarization Index\nThe insulation resistance test [26] [IEEE Std. 43-1974] is a\nuseful indicator of contamination and moisture on the insulation\nsurfaces of a winding. The insulation resistance is the ratio of the\ndc voltage applied between the winding copper and ground, to\nthe resultant current. When a dc voltage is applied, three current\ncomponents flow: a charging component into the capacitance of\nthe winding, a polarization or absorption current involving var-\nious molecular mechanisms in the insulation, and a leakage com-\nponent over the surface between exposed conductors and ground.\nThe polarization index is a variation on the dc insulation re-\nsistance test. The charging current, or indirectly the insulation\nresistance, is measured at two moments, often 15 s\nand\n60 s after energizing the winding with the dc voltage. A\nratio of indicates the presence of strongly po-\nlarizable material [14] (like water).\nG. Tangens Delta as Function of the Frequency\nThis method measures the tangens delta as a function of the\nfrequency of the test voltage [14], [20]. The tangens\ncharacteristic describes the spectrum of energy absorption by\nthe dielectric. This spectrum has several poles, i.e., relaxation\nfrequencies at which the applied signal reaches the frequency\nlimit of polarization of certain molecules in the dielectric.\nAn applied alternating voltage polarizes these molecules,\nwhich behave as dipoles. As the frequency of the applied field\nincreases, some of the molecules cannot follow the imposed\nfast changes of polarity, and stop their participation in the\npolarization process. This is observed on the dielectric constant\nfrequency characteristic\nwhich decreases with\nfrequency in steps, corresponding to different molecules active\nin the respective frequency interval (Fig. 9) [14], [20].\nThe tangens spectrum (Fig. 9) has a complemen-\ntary character, i.e., it shows resonant poles at each transition\nfrequency from one step to another on the curve.\nAn aging of the cellulose insulation has an influence on its po-\nlarization properties, which can be detected by an examination\nof the\nas well as the tangens characteristic.\nIn a simple form, this method has been implemented for sev-\neral years. A special bridge measuring the insulation capaci-\ntance at 2 Hz and 50 Hz was developed to detect high water\ncontent in the insulation. A high ratio of\nindi-\ncated an excessive water content [14].\nFig. 10. Test voltage as a function of time during the induced voltage test.\nCurrently, much research toward applying this method toward\npaper insulation condition estimation is going on.\nH. Partial Discharge\nPartial discharge is an electrical phenomenon that occurs\nwithin a transformer whenever the voltage load is sufficient to\nproduce ionization, and partially bridges the insulation between\nconductors. Although the magnitude of such discharges is\nusually small, they cause progressive deterioration and may\nlead ultimately to failure.\nEach partial discharge occurring within the transformer pro-\nduces an electrical pulse [28], [29], a mechanical pulse [29],\n[30], and TEM waves (radio) [31].\nSeveral detection techniques exist for partial discharges.\nConventional partial discharge detection, also called IEC 270\nis suited for sensitive laboratory, but cannot easily be used in\nnoisy environments, although research is being done toward\nnoise suppression [32]–[35]. Nevertheless, important informa-\ntion about PD processes, PD patterns, and fault mechanisms\ncan be obtained under laboratory conditions [36], [37], [39]. To\napply all this experience under service conditions, the so-called\nVHF PD detection has been developed [40]. In contrast to the\nconventional method, it uses narrowband detection tuned to\na frequency where an optimal signal/noise ratio can be found\n[29], [32], [41]–[43].\nAcoustical detection can be used to locate the partial dis-\ncharge source within the transformer [29], [30], [44]–[47]. Mul-\ntiple sensors are placed on the tank of the transformer and by\ncomparing propagation times of the partial discharges for each\nof the sensors, an estimated location for the PD source is gen-\nerated.\nIn case of UHF PD detection (500–1000 MHz), an antenna is\ninserted in the transformer tank through an oil valve. The TEM\nwaves generated by partial discharges are picked up by the an-\ntenna and a broadband filter is used to pick or select a suitable\nfrequency area between 500 and 1000 MHz [4], [31].\nImportant conclusions [1] are made regarding the insulation\ncondition of power transformers based on a 1-h voltage- induced\ntest (see [38], Fig. 10, and [48]). These HV apparatus are not\ndischarge free and in general a discharge level\n500 pC is tol-\nerated. However, the interpretation of the measuring results may\nstrongly depend on the opinions of the test engineers.\nAfter the PD patterns of the test setup are localized and iden-\ntified, PD patterns originating from the power transformer are\nrecorded during the enhanced voltage test. Experiences show\nthat in practice, two types of patterns are measured: 1) reg-\nular PD patterns, which are patterns that are characteristic for a\n534 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY , VOL. 17, NO. 2, APRIL 2002\nFig. 11. Regular/72 /40/8 /59/113 /41 pattern as measured during off-line measurements\non a 203-MV A transformer in good condition [37].\nFig. 12. Irregular/72 /40/8 /59/113 /41 pattern observed during off-line measurements on\na 55-MV A reactor containing PD due to a damaged screen inside the test object\n[37].\nFig. 13. /72 /40/8 /59/113 /41 pattern of a VHF measurement at 13 mHz showing PD\nactivity on phase V at 16 kV .\npower transformer in good shape (see Fig. 11), and 2) irregular\nPD patterns, which are patterns that represent intolerable PD\nsources that can relate to insulation defects after manufacturing\nor aging effects during service life (see Fig. 12). When a large\npopulation of power transformers is available for testing, a PD\ndatabase can be developed for classification of such defects in\nother transformers by their PD patterns [38]. Furthermore, such\na PD database also provides information about general trends\nin regular and/or irregular PD patterns as they occur during in-\nduced voltage tests. This information may contribute to a clearer\ninsight when assessing the insulation condition of power trans-\nformers and scheduling maintenance. As an illustration, Fig. 13\ndepicts an on-site PD measurement of the condition using the\nVHF-technique on a 50-kV/10-kV 14- MV A power transformer.\nThe measurement shows a regular PD pattern, as can be con-\ncluded from comparison with the pattern in Fig. 11. No defects\nwere found in the transformer [43].\nI. Special Aspects\n1) Furans and Moisture:The life expectancy of a high\nvoltage transformer may be determined by the state of the\ninsulation paper. Unfortunately, the insulation paper cannot\neasily be sampled from a working transformer, therefore,\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 14. RVM polarization spectra for two transformers of the same age.\n(a) Transformer 1. (b) Transformer 2 .\nthe degradation products of the paper dissolved in oil must\nbe analyzed. Trace analysis of furanic compounds (further\nmentioned as furfural) can be done by high performance liquid\nchromatography using ultraviolet detection [8], [14], [15].\nFurfural is known to be sensitive to degradation of paper,\nbut little is known of its behavior in real transformers. Recent\nstudies show that the furfural content of oil depends on the sam-\npling location and on the time elapsed between degradation and\nsampling. Since furfural is hydrophilic (or at least some com-\npounds) [opzoeken], it will tend to accumulate in humid paper.\nThe amount of adsorbed furfural depends on the partition coef-\nficients at given temperature and the humidity in the paper. At\nlower temperature, the absorption of furfural is higher and will\nbe enhanced by a higher amount of absorbed water. One can\nassume that absorption and desorption processes occur simulta-\nneously. Last but not least the decomposition of furfural will be\na key factor which will influence the concentration of degrada-\ntion products.\nThe distribution of degradation products between oil and\npaper is influenced by the\nvalue of the compounds and\nthe moisture content of the paper. The moisture content of\ninsulation paper can be inferred from the polarization spectrum\nmeasurement technique (RVM). The results [16] showed a sig-\nnificant improvement in diagnostic effectiveness by combining\nthe singular furfural method with the RVM technique.\nFig. 14 shows the results of RVM tests performed on two\ndifferent old transformers of the same type (Transformer 1 and\nTransformer 2). Transformers 1 and 2 had been in service for 36\nyears and had similar histories. They were selected to show the\ninfluence of moisture in paper on the furfural analysis. The po-\nlarization spectra of both units are relatively similar, indicating\nseveral elementary processes. Regarding these strongly inhomo-\ngeneous spectra, we can see that both units have aged insula-\ntion. The other important characteristic is the water content in\nV AN BOLHUIS et al.: MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC OF TRANSFORMER SOLID INSULATION 535\nthe paper. As known the moisture in paper plays the dominant\nrole, that is, the dominant time constant is strongly influenced\nby water content. Comparing the dominant time constants of\nthese units with data from laboratory experiments, we can esti-\nmate the equivalent moisture content in unit 1 at about 2.3%, in\nunit 2 over 3%. The furfural analysis showed 0.14 ppm in Trans-\nformer 1. For Transformer 2, this value was below the detection\nlimit of 0.01 ppm. If the RVM and furfural results are compared,\nit is clear that the RVM result is inconsistent with the furfural\nanalysis. A possible explanation for this contradiction is as fol-\nlows: if the water content in paper is high, the furfural is much\nmore strongly adsorbed than if the paper is dryer. In this case\nthere will be less furfural in the oil. The RVM method indicates\nthat the water content in the paper in Transformer 1 is higher\nthan in Transformer 2 [49]. For a more precise quantification\nof the influence of moisture on the furfural concentration in oil,\nmore research is required.\nIV . C\nONCLUSION\nIn respect to solid insulation condition estimation, there cur-\nrently are eight often used (mentioned) techniques, each with its\nown area of application and applicability. The techniques, their\nuse, development, and applicability are mentioned in Table II.\nBecause of developments in microtechnology some methods\nare undergoing development that most certainly will improve\nthe measurement and the corresponding interpretation of the\ninsulation system behavior. For successful application of mea-\nsurement results toward condition based maintenance, further\nresearch is needed, in corrobation with practical experience.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] J. J.
