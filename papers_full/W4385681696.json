This advancement\nstems, in part from the recent surge of pre-trained foundation\nmodels [41], and in part from the enthusiasm for designing task-\nspecific architectures [19, 24, 40].\nScrutinizing the recent progress [14, 15, 19, 24, 40] in VideoQA,\nwe systematize a dominant paradigm as a composition of three\nmodules: 1) a video encoder that embeds the cross-frame dynamic\non top of the frame representations, 2) a question encoder that\ncontextualizes the question semantic to acquire text embeddings,\nand 3) aacross-modal fuser that encapsulates the video and question\nembedding to the multi-modal representations, and then makes the\nprediction on top of that. Clearly, a correct prediction requires a\ncareful processing of visual clues and coordinating the interactions\nof vision-language elements to reflect the answer reasoning as a\nmutual agreement between video and question.\narXiv:2308.03267v1  [cs.CV]  7 Aug 2023\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Li et al.\nAlthough existing works have extensively adopted this para-\ndigm, we argue that the potential of current practices is seriously\nundermined due to their inability in handling the substantial re-\ndundancy of VideoQA. Specifically, the redundancy comes from\ntwo aspects:\n•The prevailing video encoder [4, 15, 41], typically models the\ninput video as a multi-level hierarchy where visual features at\ndifferent granularities are merged together in a bottom-up man-\nner (as shown in fig. 1a). However, videos are temporally re-\ndundant, the neighboring frames are similar in general because\nthey share identical environment or background, despite the\nminor differences in foreground objects. Therefore, recklessly\nmerging all adjacent frames together is neither effective nor nec-\nessary, which introduces the neighboring-frame redundancy that\nwill overwhelms the detail movement of foreground objects in\nadjacent frames. Thus, as shown in fig. 1b, we argue that an\neffective video modeling approach should focus on the object-\nlevel changes in adjacent frames rather than merging all visual\nelements in each frame together. Moreover, frame-level merging\nshould only be imposed on distant frames, where the gradual\nchanges of objects have accumulated into a qualitative change at\nthe frame level.\n•The existing cross-modal fuser [4, 10, 15, 25] performs exhaus-\ntive feature fusing, that is, merging all information from the video\nand language inputs, without differentiating the pairwise inter-\nactions between them. However, various interactions contribute\ndifferently, and only a small proportion of critical interactions\nare responsive to answering the question, leaving the rest bulk\nas cross-modal redundancy . This redundancy lead to a highly\nsparse target signal in VideoQA, making the answer reasoning\nextremely challenging. Taking fig. 1c as an example, the inter-\nactions between the query words \"girl, apple, and dog\" and the\n\"feeding\" scene in the last two clips contain the causal informa-\ntion that best supports the answer, while interactions involving\nother clips contain only environmental information and should\nbe ruled out to avoid derailing the reasoning process [3, 19, 30].\nTo resolve these limitations, we propose a novel VideoQA frame-\nwork, named Redundancy-aware Transformer (RaFormer) that\nintroduces two fundamental advancements: 1) a novel video en-\ncoder that emphasizes the object-level change within a temporal\nneighborhood by modelling object movement in adjacent frames,\nwhile avoid neighboring-frame redundancy by imposing attention\nonly on distant frames, and 2) an adaptive sampling module that en-\nables the cross-modal fuser to discover the answer critical frames in\nan interaction-aware manner. Specifically, our video encoder aims\nto model the detailed change of objects in adjacent frames, while\nimposing out-of-neighborhood message passing at frame-level to\navoid redundancy. To achieve this, we first introduce a window\ncross-attention that enhances a single frame representation using\nobjects within its temporal window. Then, on top of all enhanced\nframe representations, we adopt leap attention [46] to impose con-\nnection only between two temporal distant frames, which avoid\nthe neighboring-frame redundancy in a dilate manner. Notably, un-\nlike conventional hierarchy-based methods [4, 15, 41] that merge\nvisual elements in different granularities into a single packed rep-\nresentation (see fig. 1a), our video encoder uses a series of object\nenhanced frames to represent a video, which coordinates our fuser\ndesign. In cross-modal fusing, we first adopt a transformer-style\nencoder to exert all pairwise interactions. Then, based on encoder’s\ncross-attention map, we design an adaptive sampling module to\npinpoint a small set of critical interactions, which enables their\ncorresponding frame being collected in an adaptive manner. Upon\nthese collected critical frames, we can naturally infer the answer.\nIntuitively, such a frame down-sampling scheme acts as an infor-\nmation bottleneck [34] that condenses the critical information for\nanswering and makes it easier for a VideoQA model to capture the\nlearning pattern, thus leading to a significant improvement over\nthe original input.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n•We address the long-ignored redundancy issue in VideoQA, which\nis elicited by the neighboring-frame redundancy in current prac-\ntice of video encoder and the cross-modal redundancy of fuser.\n•We propose RaFormer, a fully transformer-based VideoQA model\nthat avoids neighboring-frame redundancy by highlighting object-\nlevel change in adjacent frames and the out-of-neighborhood\nmessage passing at frame-level. In addition, it also handles the\ncross-modal redundancy via a novel adaptive sampling module.\n•We perform extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets\nto demonstrate the effectiveness of RaFormer. The results show\nsignificant improvements over previous arts. (The absolute im-\nprovements w.r.t. accuracy are: NExT-QA [39] +3.5%, CausalVid-\nQA[16] +3.9%, MSVD-QA [42] +2.3%, MSRVTT[42] +2.6%.)\n2 RELATED WORKS\nVideo Question Answering (VideoQA). Video Question Answer-\ning (VideoQA) is a fundamental extension of ImageQA that incorpo-\nrates a temporal component. Typically, previous efforts either lever-\nage frame-level features as video representation or incorporated\nregion features as an additional input, which brings extra benefit\nfor detail-oriented question. Regardless of the input representation,\ncurrent designs tend to merge all visual elements together as the\nvideo-level representation, using some inductive biases. [14] and\n[24] pioneered graph-based structures for video modeling based\non the heterogeneity of input modality, while [41] enabled relation\nreasoning via dynamic object graphs. In recent years, a prevailing\nline of research tend to extract a multi-level hierarchy from the\nvideo sequence. [15] built a bottom-up pathway by assembling in-\nformation from clip-level to frame-level, while subsequent works\nsuch as [4] and [40] extended their approaches with an additional\nstep in the object region. Despite these advances, existing methods\noverlook the redundant nature of VideoQA tasks. In contrast, we\ndeveloped RaFormer to emphasize the two types of redundancy\nand mitigate their negative impact on answer reasoning.\nRedundancy in Video. Video related tasks [5, 6, 11–13, 21, 32, 33,\n43–45, 48] have seen significant advancements in recent years, pri-\nmarily driven by the adoption of 3D CNNs [8] or transformer archi-\ntecture [17, 35]. While these models have shown promising results\non different video tasks (including video understanding [20, 31, 38]\nand video-language tasks), there is a growing interest in devel-\noping more efficient techniques to maintain or even improve the\nperformance, due to the redundancy nature of video. In video under-\nstanding domain, previous works have explored various approaches\nRedundancy-aware Transformer for Video Question Answering MM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n[22, 36, 46] to reduce the computational cost and redundancy, such\nas using hybrid 2D-3D architectures, group convolution, or select-\ning salient clips. For the video-language tasks, [1] is the first work\nthat emphasizes the “single-frame redundancy ” issue in video.\nHowever, its a analytical work that aims to provide suggestion for\na dataset construction view. To the best od our knowledge, none\nof existing work focus on how ruling out redundancy in video can\nbring extra benefit to the VideoQA. Intuitively, a concise represen-\ntaion with limited redundancy makes model easier to capture the\ncausal pattern, thus outperforms the model trained with original\ninputs [34].\nRationale Discovery. The pursuit of explainability has led to re-\ncent developments in deep neural networks (DNN) that aim to\nreveal the intuitive evidence behind their predictions, known as\nrationales. Rationale discovery is a widely adopted practice in the\nnatural language processing (NLP) community [29], as well as in\nthe graph [37] and vision fields [47]. Recently, this trend has also ex-\ntended to the multi-modal community, with ImageQA-based tasks\nthat request additional textual evidence [7, 23] and causalvid that\napplies the concept to videoQA. Despite the progress, existing solu-\ntions often require a rationale finder with significant computation\noverhead [19] or need to be trained in a contrastive manner [18].\nRaFormer, however, can identify rationales (i.e., the critical frames)\nwithout requiring additional training loss.\n3 PRELIMINARIES\nTaking a holistic view of existing methods, we summarize the para-\ndigm of VideoQA and provide a formal definition in this section.\nThroughout the paper, we use upper-cased (e.g., 𝐴) and lower-cased\n(e.g., 𝑎) letters to denote a variable and its deterministic value, re-\nspectively.\nModeling. Given the video 𝑉 and the question 𝑄, the VideoQA\nmodel 𝐺 aims to exploit information in both visual and textual\nstreams to yield the predictive answer ˆ𝐴. In leading VideoQA meth-\nods, 𝐺 is a combination of a video encoder 𝐺𝑉, a question encoder\n𝐺𝑄 and a fuser 𝐺𝐹. It aims to encapsulate the visual content and\nlinguistic semantics into multi-modal knowledge and then generate\nthe predictive answer ˆ𝐴. Typically, an entropy-based risk function\nis adopted to abridge the predictive answer ˆ𝐴and the ground-truth\nanswer 𝐴:\nmin L((𝐺𝑉(𝑉),𝐺𝑄(𝑄))◦𝐺𝐹, 𝐴). (1)\nData representation. We take a video of 𝑇 clips and select the\nframe in the middle of each clip to serve as a representation of\nthe entire video. Each of these frames is presented by extracting a\nframe feature f𝑡 through a pretrained image recognition backbone,\nas well as 𝑆 object features o𝑡,𝑠 using a pretrained object detector,\nwhere 𝑡 and 𝑠 are the indices for frame and object, respectively. To\nrepresent the text, we use a pretrained language model as question\nencoder, which takes in the question as a sequence of𝐿tokens, and\nproduces a textual representationq𝑙 for each token. During training,\nthe visual backbones are fixed while the language backbone is\nfine-tuned end-to-end, following the approach described in [ 41].\nTo create a common𝑑-dimensional space for the representations,\nwe apply three linear mappings to f𝑡, o𝑡,𝑠, and q𝑙, respectively,\nresulting in F = {f𝑡}𝑇\n𝑡=1 ∈R𝑇×𝑑, O =\n\b\no𝑡,𝑠\n\t𝑇,𝑆\n𝑡=1,𝑠=1 ∈R𝑇×𝑆×𝑑, and\nScoring & Sampling\n! \"\n Answer Query\nTrans -Decoder !!\"(#)\nScoringSampling\nRationalizer #!#(%)\n!!\n!\" Ground-Truth%∗\n12345\n3Trans -Encoder !!%(#)\nMulti-Modal Knowledge \nWindow Cross-AttentionLeap Self-Attention\nScoring\nVideo Encoder\nRationalizer #!#(%)\n!!\nTransformer Layer\nAnswer Decoder\nAttentionMap\nCross-modal Fuser\nObject tokenFrame tokenQuestion token\nMLP[CLS] feed the cat  [CLS] pick up toy [CLS] want to feed it [CLS] touch the dog  \nABCDTrans-DecoderMLP\nPrediction\nMulti-Choice QAOpen-Ended QA\nAnswer Set Trans-Decoder!!\"Answer Query!#$\nPrediction\nQuestion\n(b) Multi-grain AggregationMulti-modal representation%\n&o&,( 8'),* 7'),* 6'),* !\"&o+,*&o+,( \"f#\nTransformer Layer...\n...q$\nq%\nq&\nCritical ObjectsCriticalFrame\nCross-Attention\nVideo Encoder\nf&\nCross-attention\nAnswer Decoder\nAtt-Map\nCross-modal Fuser\nObject tokenFrame tokenQuestion token\nQuestionLeapSelf-Attention (Step Size = 2)\nStepSizeE=4\nAdaptiveSamplingWindow Cross-Attention (Window Size = 3)\nFigure 2: Overview of RaFormer. We made the advancement\non two modules: the video encoder and the cross-modal\nfuser. The video encoder incorporates a window-based cross-\nattention that aggregates objects within a temporal window\nto enhance the representation for each frame. On top of that,\nit also adopts a leap self-attention mechanism that avoid\nneighboring-frame redundancy by imposing attention only\nto distant frames. In the Cross-modal Fuser, a cross-attention\ntakes the video and question tokens as input, yielding multi-\nmodal knowledge and a cross-modal attention map. Based\non this attention map, an adaptive sampling module identi-\nfies critical frame representations, which are then fed into a\nanswer decoder for prediction.\nQ = {q𝑙}𝐿\n𝑙=1 ∈R𝐿×𝑑, which represent the features of the frame,\nobject, and question, respectively.\n4 METHODOLOGY\nIn the existing literature, the temporal redundancy in video-language\ntasks has been analyzed by [1] from the dataset construction angle.\nHowever, a comprehensive solution for VideoQA has been missing\nuntil now. To fill this gap, we propose a novel VideoQA framework\nnamed Redundancy-aware Transformer (RaFormer). As depicted in\nfig. 2, RaFormer consists of a novel video encoder that incorporates\na window cross-attention and a leap self-attention to mitigate the\nneighboring-frame redundancy. Additionally, it tackles the cross-\nmodal redundancy by introducing an adaptive sampling module\nto cross-modal fuser, which discover the critical frames from a\nvision-language interaction perspective.\n4.1 Video Encoder\nTo encode a video instance, our video encoder aims to generate con-\ntextualized frame representations that focus on the detailed changes\nof objects within neighboring frames while avoiding neighboring-\nframe redundancy. Specifically, unlike previous encoder designs\nthat resort to multi-level hierarchy [ 4, 40, 41], which introduces\nneighboring-frame redundancy that can overwhelm the object de-\ntails, RaFormer focuses on the detail movement of objects within\nneighboring-frame by adopting a window cross-attention. It en-\nhances the representation of center frames by aggregating the ob-\njects in its temporal neighborhood. On top that, we leverage a leap\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Li et al.\nattention [46] to avoid imposing attention on neighboring frames,\nresulting a concise representation for input video.\n4.1.1 Window Cross-Attention. Window Cross-Attention (WCA)\naims to model the detailed movement of objects within a temporal\nwindow 𝑊, which helps to enhance a frame representationf𝑡 ∈R𝑑\nby aggregating all objects within its temporal window. Concretely,\nwe first add spatio-temporal position encoding to each object fea-\nture following [41], and then apply an intra-frame self-attention\nto contextualize all objects within a single frame o𝑡∈R𝑆×𝑑. Based\non the output tokens o′𝑡, we flatten the objects within a temporal\nwindow 𝑊 (denote as o𝑊\n𝑡 =\n\b\no𝑡,𝑠\n\t𝑡+(𝑊−1)/2,𝑆\n𝑡−(𝑊+1)/2,𝑠=1 ∈R𝑊×𝑆×𝑑) to the\nshape of (𝑊𝑆)×𝑑 and feed it as query to window cross-attention\ntransformer decoder, along with the corresponding frame embed-\nding f𝑡 as key and value:\no′𝑡 = Self-Attention(o𝑡)+o𝑡, (2)\nf′𝑡 = Cross-Attention𝑊(o𝑊\n𝑡 )+o𝑊\n𝑡 , s.t. |𝑊|= 𝑤 (3)\nwhere Cross-Attention𝑊 denotes window cross-attention with win-\ndow size 𝑊. In practice, we apply window cross-attention in multi-\nhead manner, where each head is set to different window size. We\nempirically show that such multi-scale temporal reception fields\nare more flexible to cater different video content, and thus bringing\nin extra benefits.\n4.1.2 Leap Attention. To avoid neighbor-frame redundancy and\npreserve object details obtained in window cross-attention, we re-\nsort to leap attention [46] that computes self-attention on discrete\ntemporal frame pairs. With this dilated strategy, we could build\nconnection only between the distant frames, instead of recklessly\nmerging all neighboring frame together, thus maintaining the de-\ntailed visual clue at object-level. Here, we use 𝐸 to denotes the\ntemporal skipped step size. For example in fig. 2, when 𝐸=2, we get\nattention connection on following frame pairs for a sequence of\nfour frames: (0,2), (1,3). Formally, by applying leap attention on the\nenhanced frame representations f′, we acquire the final output of\nvideo encoder f′′∈R𝑇×𝑑 as:\nf′′= Leap-Attention𝐸(f′)+f′, s.t. |𝐸|= 𝑒, (4)\nwhere Leap-Attention𝐸 refers leap attention with step size of𝐸. For\nsimplicity, we omit the superscript and use f ∈R𝑇×𝑑 to denote the\noutput of video encoder.\n4.2 Cross-modal Fuser with Adaptive Sampling\nAlthough we have alleviated neighboring-frame redundancy with\nthe video encoder design, cross-modal redundancy can still over-\nwhelm the critical information when fusing frame and question\ntokens. To address that, we introduce Adaptive Sampling (AS), a\nparameter-free module that adaptively down-samples frame tokens\naccording to their interaction activeness with question embedding.\nAs shown in fig. 3, we first use the attention map between frame\nand question tokens to indicate their interaction activeness. Then,\nwe flatten and normalize all 𝑇 ×𝐿interactions to get a probability\ndistribution 𝑝 over all interactions. Next, we calculate cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF) based on 𝑝, and then select a subset of\ninteractions using inverse transform sampling. Finally, we softly\ndown-sample the frames by selecting tokens that corresponds to the\nhigh\nlow\n1.ride the bike 2.look the girl 3.push the bike 4.repair road 5.turn around\nWhat does the lady do after stopping her bike?\n<CLS>\n<CLS> ride the bike<CLS>  look the girl<CLS> push the bike <CLS> repair road <CLS> turn around\n×\n×\nAttention Map A\n在此处键入公式。\nNormalize &Flatten to 1-D\n Accumulative Sum\nCDF\nFlattened interaction index\nUniformly select N samples from y-axis\nCollect sampled interactions\nMap back to 2-D\nCritical Frames f&\nScoring\nSelect tokens\nT x L\nT\nL\nL\nT\nN=4\nNormalize &Flatten to 1-D\n Accumulative Sum\nCDF\nFlattened interaction index\nUniformly select N samples from y-axis\nCollect sampled interactions\nMap back to 2-D\nSelect tokens\nProbability P in size of 1x(TL)\nCritical Frames f&\nL T\nNumber of selected interaction N=4\nL\nT\nCross-attMap z\n1\n2\n3\n45\n)\n(()\nFigure 3: Illustration of Adaptive Sampling process.\nsampled interactions, which adaptively remove redundant frames\nwith the minimal computational overhead.\n4.2.1 Interaction Scoring. To gather the critical frames, a naive\nsolution is to generate an importance vector in size of 1 ×𝑇 by\nprepending a ⟨CLS⟩token to the question, which denotes the contri-\nbution of each of frame tokens, and then we can collect the critical\nframes by selecting from this importance vector. However, the col-\nlection under such a scheme suffers from uni-modal bias [2]. As a\nresult, tokens with similar background can exert a high attention\nscore, and will be more likely to be selected, while ignoring the the\nquestion-critical ones. Instead, we identifies the critical frames via\nthe cross-modal interactions – a mutual agreement of vision and\nlanguage modalities. As shown in the right part of fig. 2, first apply\na cross-attention using encoded framesf as query and and question\nembedding q as key and value, which yields the frame token ¯f as\nwell as the pre-normalized cross-attention mapz ∈R𝑇×𝐿 as output:\n¯f,z = Cross-Attention(f,q)+f. (5)\nBased on the cross-attention mapz, we apply our adaptive sampling.\n4.2.2 Adaptive Frame Sampling. Adaptive Sampling (AS) aims to\nselect 𝑁 interactions from z ∈R𝑇×𝐿 (𝑁 ≪𝑇 ×𝐿), then we can\ncollect the corresponding 1-D tokens from the 2-D interactions\nview. Notably, by keeping only one frame when selected repetitively,\nwe end up with an adaptive frame collection where only a small\nproportion of ¯𝑓 are selected as critical frames f𝑐 (i.e., |f𝑐|<= 𝑁).\nSpecifically, to select N interactions from z, a naive approach\nis to select top-N with highest score. However, this deterministic\napproach does not perform well, because it discards all interactions\nwith lower scores. Some of these interactions, however, can be\nuseful particularly at the earlier stages when the features are less\ndiscriminative. Therefore, we resort to inverse transform sampling\nto sample interactions in an differentiable manner. As shown in\nfig. 3, we first flatten z into the shape of 1 ×(𝑇𝐿), and then apply a\nsoftmax over all interactions to obtain the significance scores that\ncan be interpreted as probabilities p ∈R1×(𝑇𝐿):\np = Softmax(Flatten(z)).

(8)\nIn other words, the significance scorep is used to calculate the map-\nping function between the indices of the original interactions and\nthe sampled interactions.

Since DCF−1 ∈\nR, we consider the indices of the tokens with the nearest significant\nscores as the sampling indices.\nAfter acquiring the 𝑁 sampled interactions, we collect their\ncorresponding frame tokens as critical framesf𝑐. It is worth noticing\nthat gathering 1-D tokens from the 2-D interaction view can incur\nrepetition. Thus, we only keep one frame if it is selected multiple\ntimes, which enables an adaptive collection of critical frames.\n4.3 Answer Prediction\nTo generate the predicted answer, we use a transformer-based an-\nswer decoder that receives an answer query to extract the predictive\ninformation from the multi-modal features, and select the the pre-\ndicted answer ˆ𝐴 from the answer candidates. According to task\nsetting, the answer candidates can be provided as |𝐴𝑚𝑐|sentences\nthat are tailored for each instance in the case of multi-choice QA, or\nas global answer categories of size |𝐴𝑜𝑒|that are shared among all\ninstances (a.k.a. , Open-ended QA). This lead to the two formations\nof answer query (see in fig. 4).\n4.3.1 Multi-Choice QA. In the Multi-Choice setting (see fig. 4 left),\nthe answer candidates are given as multiple sentences tailored\nfor each instance. To generate a holistic representation for each\ncandidate answer, we prepend a ⟨CLS⟩token and use the same\nlanguage model in the question encoder to process the each answer\ncandidate in parallel. Then we gather the processed ⟨CLS⟩tokens\nfrom |𝐴𝑚𝑐|answer candidates representations and form the answer\nquery Q𝑚𝑐 ∈ R|𝐴𝑚𝑐 |×𝑑. During decoding, we feed the answer\nquery Q𝑚𝑐 as the query and the concatenation of critical frames and\nquestion (i.e., [f𝑐; q]) as key and value to the transformer decoder,\nand the decoder outputs the embedding h𝑚𝑐 ∈R|𝐴𝑚𝑐 |×𝑑 as:\nh𝑚𝑐 = Transformer-Decoder(Q𝑚𝑐,[f𝑐; q]) (9)\nTable 1: Dataset statistics.

Notably, since\nthe correctness of a answer candidate is invariant to its position,\nanswer query is free of position encoding. Finally, we apply a linear\nprojection on h𝑚𝑐 to obtain the predictive answer ˆamc ∈R|𝐴𝑚𝑐 |.\nˆa𝑚𝑐 = MLP(h𝑚𝑐) (10)\n4.3.2 Open-ended QA. In the open-ended setting, it is common\npractice [19, 40] to treat each candidate answer in the global answer\nset as a category, which makes the size of the answer set too large\nto be processed as multi-choice. Therefore, we initialize a single\nlearnable embedding, denoted as Q𝑜𝑒 ∈R𝑑, as the answer query\nfor this setting.\nSimilar to eq. (9), we use the transformer decoder to process the\nanswer query Q𝑜𝑒 along with the concatenation of critical frames\nand question ([f𝑐; q]) as the key and value. This results in a decoded\nrepresentation ℎ𝑜𝑒 ∈R𝑑. Finally, we projectℎ𝑜𝑒 to the answer space\nR|𝐴𝑜𝑒 |to obtain the prediction ˆa𝑜𝑒.\nˆa𝑜𝑒 = MLP(ℎ𝑜𝑒). (11)\nTo align the predictive answer with the gold answer, we establish\nour objective on a cross-entropy loss.\n5 EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we show the experimental results that answer the\nfollowing research questions:\n•RQ1: How effective is RaFormer compared with the State-of-the-\nArt (SoTA) models?\n•RQ2: How do modules of Raformer and parameter setting affect\nthe performance?\n•RQ3: What learning pattern does RaFormer capture?\nDatasets: To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed design, we\nconduct experiments on four benchmark datasets that challenge\nRaFormer from different aspects. Specifically, we use the prevalent\nMulti-Choice setting of NExT-QA [39] and Causal-VidQA [16]\nto test the model’s temporal reasoning ability with complex causal\nand commonsense relations. As a complement, we also use the\nOpen-Ended setting of MSVD-QA [42] and MSRVTT-QA [42],\nwhich mainly emphasize the description of video objects, activities,\nand their attributes. For detailed statistics of the datasets, please\nrefer to Tab. 1.\nImplementation Details: We followed the standard procedure\nestablished in [18, 19, 41] for sampling videos, where each video\nis represented as a sequence of 𝑇 = 16 frames, and each frame is\nencoded using a ViT-L [27] model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k. To\nextract object-level features, we used a Faster-RCNN [28] model pre-\ntrained on the Visual Genome, which detects𝑆 = 20 objects on each\nframe. For encoding the textual input (questions and answers), we\nused a pre-trained Deberta-base model [9] as the question encoder.\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Li et al.\nTable 2: Accuracy (%) comparison on Causal-VidQA.

Specifically, our observations are as follows:\n•QA settings. When comparing RaFormer’s performance across\nfour datasets, we observe that it provides a greater improve-\nment to Multi-Choice QA than to Open-Ended QA. Specifically,\nNExT-QA and Causal-VidQA saw an increase of 3.9% and 3.5%,\nrespectively, while MSVD-QA and MSRVTT only saw an increase\nof 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively, compared to previously reported\nresults. This difference can be explained by two aspects: Firstly,\nMulti-Choice QA datasets tend to have longer videos with more\nobjects, which inevitably introduce more neighboring-frame re-\ndundancy, compared to the Open-ended setting. Luckily, our\nvideo encoder is better suited to handle neighboring-frame re-\ndundancy, thus can bring more favorable improvement to Multi-\nChoice QA. Secondly, Multi-Choice datasets involve complex\nreasoning scenarios with composite question sentences and long\nvideos, leading to more cross-modal redundancy. In contrast,\nOpen-Ended datasets typically feature simpler questions and\nshorter videos. Therefore, our adaptive sampling strategy is par-\nticularly well-suited for this scenario, which achieves a larger\ngain in Multi-Choice QA by wiping out more environmental\nframes.\n•Question type. Narrowing down the analysis to Multi-Choice\ndatasets (NExT-QA and CausalVid-QA), it is apparent that the\nperformance gain is primarily due to improvement in the com-\nposite question type (including: Acc@C&Acc@T in NExT-QA,\nAcc@E& Acc@P& Acc@C in Causal-VidQA), which involves\ndeeper understanding such as causal relation and counterfactual\nthinking. In contrast, the improvement in the descriptive ques-\ntion type is much more moderate (Acc@D: +0.5% on NExT-QA,\nand +1.0% on CausalVid). This highlights RaFormer’s exceptional\nreasoning ability for complex questions. In particular, there is a\nsignificant improvement in reason-based questions on Causal-\nVidQA (Q→AR: Acc@P +2.8%, Acc@C +6.9%), where the model\nhas to justify its prediction by selecting the correct evidence.\nThis naturally aligns with the mechanism of adaptive sampling,\nmaking RaFormer an ideal solution for this question type.\n•Benchmark size. Regarding the performance improvement on\nOpen-Ended datasets, it is interesting to note that the gain on\nMSRVTT-QA (+2.6%) is larger than that on MSVD-QA (+2.3%),\ndespite sharing the exactly same question type. We suggest that\nthe difference in dataset volume may have played a role in this\nobservation, since MSVD-QA is five times smaller than MSRVTT-\nQA (cf. Tab. 1). This could limit the reasoning ability of Raformer\non MSVD-QA due to a smaller amount of training data. This\nhighlights the potential of Raformer when trained on larger and\nmore diverse datasets.\n5.2 In-Depth Study (RQ2)\n5.2.1 Ablative Results. We scrutinize some key designs in RaFormer\nby performing model ablation and discussing other implementation\nalternatives. The observations of Tab. 4 are as follows:\n•In the top section, we study the design of our video encoder. In the\n1st row, we study the effectiveness of window cross-attention by\nreplacing it with a conventional object merging method [40, 41]\n(i.e., apply mean pooling to merge all objects in a single frame,\nthen add the pooled representation to the frame feature), where\nthe performance drop of this alternative (“w/o WCA”) demon-\nstrates the necessity of capturing the object transition details\nRedundancy-aware Transformer for Video Question Answering MM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada\nTable 4: Ablative study on NExT-QA and MSRVTT-QA.\nVariants NExT-QA MSRVTTAcc@C Acc@T Acc@D Acc@All\nw/o WCA 57.7 57.3 67.9 59.2 41.1\nw/o LA 58.4 57.0 65.7 59.2 41.3\nw/o WCA & LA 57.1 56.3 65.6 58.2 40.8\nw/o AS 57.1 56.6 67.3 58.7 41.4\nHard TopN 56.9 57.6 68.3 59.0 41.7\n⟨CLS⟩Sampling 57.0 56.2 65.0 58.1 41.3\nw/o Enc & AS 57.3 55.4 64.1 57.9 40.3\nRaFormer 58.2 57.7 67.8 59.6 42.3\nin adjacent frames. In 2nd row, we verify the efficacy of Leap-\nAttention (LA) in reducing the neighboring-frame redundancy\nby replacing it with a vanilla self-attention. As a result, we also\nwitness a performance drop on this variant (“w/o LA”), which\ndemonstrates cutting off connections between adjacent frames\nand restricts them to the distant frames can remove the redun-\ndancy from temporal dimension. In the 3rd row, we ablate the\nwhole encoder design by removing both window attention and\nleap attention, the denote this variant as “w/o WCA & LA”. We\nnotice the performance of this variant drops more significantly,\nwhich means the benefits of WCA and LA focus on different\naspect of video encoding, (WCA for modelling object detail in ad-\njacent frames, LA help to restrict neighboring-frame redundancy)\nand their contribution can be added together.\n•In the bottom section, some mutants of the adaptive sampling are\ninvestigated. First, we study the impact of our sampling strategy\nby removing the adaptive sampling module (“w/o AS”), where\nall frames are used for answer prediction without differentiating\ntheir interactions with question. As expected, the accuracy drop\ndemonstrates the negative impact of in redundant interactions in\nanswer reasoning as well as the necessity of critical frame down-\nsampling. Next, we show that collecting critical interactions via\nhard ranking of (i.e., Hard TopN) interaction scores results in sub-\noptimal performance. The reason is that, in hard topN, interaction\nwith a relatively smaller score will not be explored, even if the\nscores itself are far from discriminative at the early stage, thus\nleading to poor optimization. However, RaFormer circumvents\nthis issue by sampling from inversed cumulative distribution\nfunction, which enable a better exploration of the interactions\nin a differentiable manner. As discussed in Sec. 4.2.1, we also\nanalyze the benefits of interaction-aware sampling by comparing\nto an alternative that collects critical frames from a probability\nvector generated ⟨CLS⟩token. As expected, this variant causes\na sharp performance decline. We empirically find that this is\nbecause of the uni-modal bias issue mentioned in Sec. 4.2.1, i.e., ,\nthe high correlated adjacent frames can induce a selection bias\nthat prompts visually similar tokens as critical frames, instead of\nthe answer-responsive ones.\n•Finally, we show the effectiveness of our overall design by ab-\nlating both encoder (implemented as “w/o WCA & LA”) and\nadaptive sampling (implemented as “w/o AS”). We show this\nvariant, denoted as “w/o Enc & LA”, performs poorly comparing\nto RaFormer, which testifies that our overall design is reasonable.\n5.2.2 Study of Window Size. In order to investigate the effect of\nwindow cross-attention, the performance of RaFormer is studied\nusing different window sizes 𝑊. Specifically, the default setting\nuses 4-head attention, where different heads can have the same\nwindow size or varied ones. As shown in Tab. 5, when setting all\nheads’ window size to 1, the model delivers the worst accuracy,\nwhich demonstrates the necessity of modeling the objects in the\nneighboring frame. As the window size increases, the model delivers\nbetter results on MSRVTT when the window size is equal to 3,\nwhile NExT-QA reaches its peak at 𝑊=5. This discrepancy may\nbe caused by the complexity of the video source. Videos in NExT-\nQA feature relational reasoning among multiple objects, where a\nlarger window size can incorporate more temporal related objects,\nthus benefiting the relational reasoning. In comparison, MSRVTT\ntypically questions the attributes of a single object, making a smaller\nwindow size sufficient to capture the answer information. Finally,\nthe results in last row show that none of the single-size window\nsettings can beat the multi-scale encoding, where four attention\nheads are equipped with different window sizes. This demonstrates\nthat multi-scale window settings are more flexible in catering to\ndifferent video content.\n5.2.3 Study of Sample Size N. To validate how the size of the sam-\npled interaction 𝑁 affect RaFormer, we conduct experiments with\na variation of 𝑁 and show the results in fig. 6. In both datasets, we\nobserve constant performance gains as 𝑁 increases from 1, and the\npeaks are reached at around 10. Then, as𝑁 keeps growing, the accu-\nracies in both datasets drop since more redundancies are introduced.\nIt is worth noticing that, RaFormer can surpass all existing meth-\nods even with 𝑁 equal to 1 (i.e., only one frame is select and used\nto infer the answer), which shed light on the redundancy nature\nof VideoQA task, and the deficiency of currents methods as their\nignorance of this inherent redundancy. Compare to MSRVTT-QA,\nfluctuation on NExT-QA is more drastic when 𝑁 is small, where\nthe altering can cause a 5% difference in accuracy. This is because\nquestions of MSRVTT-QA generally focus on the description of a\nsingle entity, where the crtical frames are more perceivable even\nwith small 𝑁. In contrast, the NExT-QA typically questions the tem-\nporal relation in a composite scenario, where a small 𝑁 is unable\nto cover the golden frames that delivers the answer information,\nthus leading to sub-optimal performance.\n5.2.4 Study of Critical Frames. To grasp the learning insight of\nRaFormer, we analyzed the number of identified critical frames in\nthe original videos and present the statistics in fig. 7. As expected,\nour adaptive sampling can identify a small group of tokens as crit-\nical frames while leaving the rest as redundant. Specifically, we\nobserved that NExT-QA requires more frames to answer questions\nthan MSRVTT-QA. This is due to the relational reasoning nature of\nNExT-QA, which requires clues from multiple entities, and are typi-\ncally associated with more frames. In contrast, MSRVTT-QA mainly\nfocuses on the description of a single object, which can be encoded\nwith fewer frames. Interestingly, although RaFormer’s peak perfor-\nmance on MSRVTT-QA and NExT-QA is achieved with almost the\nsame size of critical interaction group (both around 𝑁=10 cf. fig. 6),\nthe number of critical frames differs significantly between the two\ndatasets. This demonstrates that our frame selection strategy can\nadaptively cater to different VideoQA instances.\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Li et al.\nQ2.

Following this line, fig. 5 shows\nsome predictive results on NExT-QA along with the identified criti-\ncal frames. To better understand learning pattern of adaptive sam-\npling, we also mark the question tokens that corresponds to the\nsampled interactions, which can be interpreted as \"critical words\".\nHere, each video instance comes with two questions that inquire\nabout visual clues at different frames. Generally, RaFormer can\nlocate very few indicative elements that involve the interaction of\nhigh activitness. For the critical words, RaFormer tends to imply the\nentity in the video (e.g., “man\", “lady\") as well as words that serve as\na temporal indicator (e.g., “after\", “end\"). As for the identified critical\nframes, we notice that our adaptive sampling tends to select frames\nthat contains the key entities in the question (e.g., “man\", “lady\").\nSimilarly, it also select frames that corresponds to the temporal in-\ndicator, which benefits critical frames selection by narrowing down\nthe target scope. This is attributed to our cross-modal sampling\nstrategy, where the answer is referred to as a mutual agreement\nbetween critical frames and question words. Apart from that, we\nalso notice that, even for the same video, RaFormer can accredit\ndifferent scenes as the critical frames in response to the question\nclues. Such adaptiveness demonstrates the design philosopy of our\nsampling module, where frames are differentiate base on their inter-\naction activeness with question, making different question target\nat different scene.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we pinpoint the redundancy issue in current VideoQA\nparadigm. Specifically, we design a novel video encoder to empha-\nsize the modelling of detailed object movement within the neigh-\nboring frames, while address the neighboring-frame redundancy by\nimposing the leap attention that models the frame-level represen-\ntations in a dilate manner. To tackle the cross-model redundancy\nin prevailing fuser design, we incorporate an adaptive sampling\nstrategy that select a small set of critical frames according to their\ninteractions with question tokens.
