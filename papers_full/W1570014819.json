Introduction\nPower transformers are some of the most important equipment for the transmis sion and\ndistribution of electric power . A single failure in a transformer causes disturbances in the\nelectric network and may cause severe conﬂicts in hospitals, banks, industrial installations or\nurban areas in general.\nIn Mexico, the transmission network is composed by 350 power substations and 2,580\npower transformers.

For this\nreason, it is important to observe and register the amount and type of failures that have\npresented the transformers in the country .\nT able 1 shows the type of transformer failures from 1997 to 2007 (CFE, 2010).\nFailure 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 T otal\nwinding insulation 11 65 1 0 5294656 69\ncore 00000000002 2\nbushing 32531311575 36\non load tap changer 20222211231 18\nexplosion with ﬁre 13002020300 11\nother failures 10102412000 11\nTOT AL 18 11 13 15 12 11 14 8 16 15 14 147\nT able 1. T ype of failures in transformers since 1997.\nNotice that the highest percentage of failures corresponds to isolation in the windings .\nProblems with insulation represent 80% of the failures for contamination, aging and co re\ninsulation. Other causes can be overvoltage or short circuits. The insulation failure s can be\nslow degradation, while overvoltage and short circuits represent instantaneous failures. The\nMexican case is not unique. Failures in transformers in United States and Russiashow similar\nresults.\nAll these common failures can be considered as mechanical failures, in contrast to other\nchemical based failures. Consequently , mechanical failures cause vibration.\n6\nwww.intechopen.com\n2 Vibration Analysis\nLiterature reports different methods for the diagnosis of power transformers. Among the most\nimportant are the following:\n• dissolved gas analysis: analyzes the chemical composition of the isolating oil. Pe rcentages\nof different gases are found and tables provide a relation between these percentages and\nthe status of the transformer . It is widely used to detect all the faults relatedwith oil.\n• frequency response analysis: analyzes the transformer response given a vol tage or current\nexcitation. The response is analyzed in the domain of frequency in magnitude and phas e.\nLater , this response is compared with known reference responses and then, a difference\nfrom the correct operation can be detected. Also, a signature of certain faults can be\nobtained and compared.\n• partial discharge: utilizes acoustic sensors to detect the location of partial discharges\noccurrence inside the transformer . A partial discharge is a transient electric discharge that\nbridges the isolation gap between two conductors. It is then possible to detect deﬁciencies\nin the transformer isolation.\nAn alternative method for detecting failures in transformers is the analysis of the vibration\nproduced inside the transformer due to its operation. Normally , the transform er produces\nvibrations in the windings and the core, and these vibrations vary according to certain\noperative conditions. Also, in the presence of mechanical failures, the vibration patter n is\ndifferent than in normal conditions. One advantage of this alternative method for de tecting\nfailures, with respect to the mentioned methods is that it is possible to design an on-line\ndiagnosis system. This implies that the detection of the incipient failures can be achieved\nat all times, while the transformer is working.\nThis chapter presents the development of a probabilistic model of the vibrations in a\ntransformer given all the possible combinations of operating conditions. The probabilistic\nmodels are Bayesian networks (BN). The BN are directed acyclic graphs that represent the\nprobabilistic relation between the variables in a domain. In this case, we obtain a Bayesian\nnetwork that codiﬁes the relation between the vibration signals with all the variables that\nconform the operative conditions. The model is obtained using automatic learning algorithms\napplied to historical data of the transformer working at different conditions. The BN is used\nto calculate the probability of a failure, given the evidence from the operative conditions.\nThe next section establishes the central problem in this project, namely the vibrations in a\npower transformer . Also, section 2 reviews reviews some of the related work reported in the\nliterature.\n2. Power transformers\nThe transformer is an electrical device without moving parts, that is used to transf er energy\nfrom one circuit to another through a common magnetic ﬁeld, with no direct electrical\nconnection between the two circuits, (Harlow, 2007).\nBasically consists of two or more windings (coils) and a common core of steel. When a voltage\nis applied in the exciting coil, the coils exchange energy via magnetic induction that occurs\nwhen an electric current variation in time is passed in one of them.\nFigure 1 shows the idealized model of a two windings transformer with steel co re. When\napplied an alternating voltage (V1) to the exciting winding, a current (I1) ﬂows and generates\na magnetic ﬂux ( φ). The ﬂux circulates in the steel core so that the voltage ( V2) is induced\n104 Recent Advances in Vibrations Analysis\nwww.intechopen.com\nProbabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power T ransformers 3\nin the second winding. The ratio of applied voltage and induced voltage ideall y depends\non the number of turns of each coil. For example, if the number of turns in the pr imary\nwinding is twice that of the secondary winding, then the voltageV2 induced in the secondary\nis half of V1. This considering that almost 100% of the ﬂow is driven by the core. In power\ntransformers is commonly used steel laminated core for high capacity that has to drive the\nmagnetic ﬂux (steel core laminated from very thin sheets, such as .23 mm for reduced eddy\nand hysteresis losses). The ability of a material to conduct magnetic ﬂux is called permeability .\nCurrently , there are electrical steels for power applications with permeability in the order of\n1,500 compared with 1.0 for air .\nFig. 1. Ideal transformer: two coils applied on steel core.\nT ransformers can be classiﬁed according to their application, construction or power\ncapabilities. In the electricity transmission process, the utilized power transformers are\ncharacterized by the high levels of voltage and current that they handle. Power transmission\nrequires power transformers to transmit energy from voltage production ce nters over long\ndistances to consumption areas. Here, power transformers decrement the voltage down again\nfor distribution to consumers. The distribution process requires transformers with less voltage\nand current. They are called distribution transformers.\nFor the design and construction of power transformers, regardless of size and power , various\nmaterials are used such as:\n• Thin magnetic steel plates in the core.\n• Copper or aluminum as conductor material in the coils (see Fig. 2).\n• Cellulose products like high density paper and pressboard as solid insulation material.\n• Mineral oil as liquid insulating material, which also functions as a coolant.\n• Steel for the tank.\nAdditionally , the transformer has several external accessories such as (see Fig. 3):\n• Radiators, fans and oil circulating pumps for the cooling function.\n• Bushings as an insulating structure, for connection of windings to the outside.\n• Oil temperature indicators.\n• Oil Level Indicator\n105Probabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power Transformers\nwww.intechopen.com\n4 Vibration Analysis\nFig. 2. Inner part of the transformer . The core and coils assembly is shown at the\nmanufacturing stage. (Courtesy of Prolec GE ).\n• Pressure relief devices.\n• Winding temperature indicator .\n• Sudden pressure relay .\n• Desiccant breathers.\n• Liquid preservation systems.\n2.1 Vibration in transformers\nT ransformers always vibrate while operating. Vibration can be detected at differe nt\nfrequencies, in different places of the transformer and caused by different sources. According\nto the literature, vibration below 100 Hz. is caused by cooling fans and oil pumps. Vibration s\nabove 1000 Hz. are caused by small elements not related to the state of the core or\nwinding (Golubev et al., 1999). Thus, the vibration frequency range of interest in t ransformer\ndiagnosis is between the power frequency of 60 Hz (50 in Europe) and multiples of this up to\n960 Hz.\nIn normal operating conditions, the main sources of vibration are the core and the winding\nof the power transformers. This vibration is transmitted to the transformer tank through the\n106 Recent Advances in Vibrations Analysis\nwww.intechopen.com\nProbabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power T ransformers 5\nFig. 3. Power transformer at the electrical substation. (Courtesy of Prolec GE ).\ncooling oil and through the solid structure. Different levels of vibration can be measured at\ndifferent locations of the transformer .\nVibration in the winding is caused by Lorenz forces that depend on the current density\nand the leakage ﬂux density . Since the leakage ﬂux and the current density have different\ndirections, the winding force density has components in the radial and axial directions. Also,\nboth components are a function of loading current, so the total Lorenz forces are quadratic\nfunctions of the current. It is worth to mention that the vibration caused by the winding is not\ntoo signiﬁcant under normal operating conditions, but it is signiﬁcant under several kinds of\nfailures.\nVibrations at the core are caused by the magnetostriction process. It consists of changes\nof the dimension of core laminations, made by ferromagnetic materials, due t o changes of\norientation of the material crystals for magnetic ﬁelds. Thus, magnetostrictive effe cts are\nfunction of the magnitude of the applied ﬁeld. Also, it is known that these magneto strictive\nforces have a fundamental frequency of 120 Hz. i.e., twice the exciting frequency . Other source\nof core vibration is the air gap produced by the magnetic repulsion among laminations. This\nrepulsion forces are mostly present at the corner joints of the core legs with the jokes, and it\nhas also a fundamental frequency of 120 Hz (Lavalle, 1986).\nIn case of a failure like a short circuit, the mechanical integrity of the transformer can be\naltered. Certain changes, such as loss of winding clamping pressure, will lead to insulation\n107Probabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power Transformers\nwww.intechopen.com\n6 Vibration Analysis\ndeterioration, and therefore, the vibrational response will be altered. In general, m ost of the\nfailures occurring in the transformer , produce mechanical deformations in the windin g, and\nhence, a change in the vibrational signature of the transformer . T ypical failures occurring\nat the transformer core are caused by short circuits between core laminations or between\nthe core and the tank. Since the tank is grounded, if several contact points between core\nand tank exist, a current will ﬂow and temperature will rise. Also with laminations shor t\ncircuits, the temperature increases. In general, temperature changes will produce changes\nin the insulation system that will produce mechanical changes that provoke changes in the\nvibrational signature of the transformer .\nSummarizing, most of the failures in the winding and core of the transformer , will produce\nmechanical changes and will turn out in changes in the vibration pattern of the transformers.\n2.2 Related work in transformers diagnosis by vibrations\nSeveral technical groups have worked in the study of vibrations for identifying and\ndiagnosing mechanical faults. The basic approach followed by all the research groups i s\nthe development of a model that represents the behavior of the transformer under different\nconditions. Later , when new readings are obtained, the model estimates or predicts the\nbehavior of the transformer and a comparison with the current behavior can identify abnormal\nevents. The key question here ishow can this model be deﬁned?. This question has been answered\ndifferently by some research groups.\nThe Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the Massachusetts Institute\nof T echnology (MIT) elaborated a series of Master of Science thesis devoted to the\ndevelopment of vibration models for faults identiﬁcation in transformers (Crow ley, 1990;\nLavalle, 1986; McCarthy, 1987). First, they ut ilized an analytical model that relates the\nharmonic content of one input (square of the current) to one output (the vibration in the\nwinding). The basic model has the form y = Cu where y is a vector whose components\nare the amplitude of the vibrations discomposed at frequencies multiple of 120Hz. u is the\ncurrent squared vector at the some frequencies andC is the matrix with parameters that relate\nthem. The elements cij of C are estimated in a set of experiments made to a transformer free\nof faults at different conditions of load. For a given load condition, and for each frequency ,\nseveral measurements were averaged and related with a Least-Squares algorithm to deﬁne\nthe cij parameters. Other experiments were made to relate effects of the temperature in the\nsame structure of measures. A third set of experiments was carried out in presence of a fault:\na loosened up the windings. Other experiments consider the effects of the core vibr ations\nin the winding vibrations. When both the winding and the core are excited simultaneously ,\nthe sources of vibration may have phase differences. They proposed a model that includes\nlinear compensation for winding temperature, weighted by the harmonic ampl itudes of the\nloading current squared, and linear compensation terms for core temperature and excitati on\nvoltage. Summarizing, the MIT theses propose a model that requires the acquisition of certain\nparameters from experiments implemented off-line. Later , these parameters are compared\nwith the on-line parameters to detect changes in the normal behavior of the transformer.\nSpanish Unión Fenosa proposes a model that is also based on vibrations (García et al.,\n2006a;b). They measure vibrations at the tank of the transformer , claiming that the vibrations\nare transmitted to the tank from two sources: the winding and the core. Thus, the vibration at\nthe tank results from the vibration of the windings plus the vibration of the core, multiplied\nby a coefﬁcient of transmission. The winding vibration is proportional to the square of the\n108 Recent Advances in Vibrations Analysis\nwww.intechopen.com\nProbabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power T ransformers 7\ncurrent, and the vibration at the core is proportional to the square of the voltage. They also\nconsider the temperature of the transformer as an important parameter in their mode l, so\nthey complemented their analytical model with complex variables that represent the real and\nimaginary part of the amplitude of the vibration, the current and the voltage respectively , at\nthe main frequency component. Other parameters are the oil temperature, and the geography\nof the transformer . These parameters must be deﬁned through measurements taken off -line\nfor each kind of transformer . Their diagnosis method consists of the estimati on of the tank\nvibration and its comparison with the real measure. If the difference is greater that certain\nthreshold, then a fault is detected.\nThe Russian experiments (Golubev et al., 1999) install accelerometers in both sides of the\ntransformer in order to acquire vibration measurements while the transformer is worki ng\nproperly . They executed two sets of experiments. In the ﬁrst experiments, no load is included\nin order to detect the vibration pattern due to the core. In the second set of ex periments,\nload is included for detecting vibration from both, core and winding. Thus, they subtract\nthe effect of both minus the effect of the core to deduce the effects of the winding. With\nthis information, they calculate four coefﬁcients that reﬂect the clamping pressures. If these\ncoefﬁcients exceed 90%, then the clamping pressure is in a good state. Between 80% and\n90%, the pressure is in a fair state but the transformer can continue operating. Below 80%,\nthe pressure is critical and requires immediate attention. This approach has been te sted in\nmore than 200 transformers 110-500 kV to 50 MV A in Russia with a rate of more than 80%\nconﬁrmed diagnosis. Also, Manitoba Hydro power plants in Canada tested their large power\ntransformers with this methodology with good results.\nThe approaches commented above, and our approach have similar basis. All utilize vibration\nmeasures in the tank of the transformer . All transform the vibration signals to the frequency\ndomain in order to process the vibration components at the different frequencies. All\npropose a model that is utilized to estimate vibration amplitude values, and then compare\nwith real measurements in order to detect changes in the behavior . In the revised work,\nmodels are deduced with analytical equations to deﬁne certain parameters that have to\nbe acquired off-line over a testing transformer . Experiments are required over different\noperating conditions and also, in presence or absence of different faults. All these approaches\ndeduce a general model for all kind of transformers where the experiments deﬁne the speciﬁc\nparameter for each kind of transformer .\nThe approach proposed in this chapter also utilizes a model. However , this model\nrepresents the probabilistic relations between condition operational variables and vibrat ion\nmeasurements. This implies some special advantages:\n• several automatic learning algorithms are available for model construction,\n• empirical human expertise can be included in the models,\n• the models can be adapted constantly for each kind of transformer in its real op erational\ncondition. This means that the diagnosis may still work even if the transformer i s old and\nvibrates more that when new , but still working properly .\n• other sources of information can be included, for example, structural characteristics of a\ntransformer .\nThe next section describes basis for the proposed model.\n109Probabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power Transformers\nwww.intechopen.com\n8 Vibration Analysis\n3. Probabilistic modeling\nThe basic idea in this work is the representation of the vibration behavior of the transfor mer\nunder different operational conditions. This allows detecting deviations of the normal\nbehavior of the transformer . Therefore, the idea is to calculate the probability of an abnormal\nbehavior , given the operational conditions and the vibration measured. The representation of\nthe behavior is built using probabilistic models and speciﬁcally Bayesian networks.\nThe basic idea is the following. Calculating the probability of an abnormal behavior\n(hypothesis H) can be made using the evidence recollected ( E) and the Bayes theorem as\nfollows:\nP(H | E)= P(E | H)P(H)\nP(E) (1)\nFor example, if we want to calculate the probability of a windings loosened up hypothesis\n(P(H | E)) given that we observe high vibration as evidence, we could easily calculate by\ncounting the times that we observe high vibration given that we knew that the transformer\nhas loosened up windings ( P(E | H)). However , if multiple hypotheses exist, and multiple\nevidence can be obtained, then the Bayes theorem in this form is not practical. What is needed\nis a practical representation of the dependencies and independences between the variables in\nan application. This representation is formed by the Bayesian networks (BN).\nFormally , a Bayesian network is deﬁned as a directed acyclic graph, whose nodes represent\nthe variables in the application, and the arcs represent the probabilistic dependency of\nthe connected nodes (Pearl, 1988). The Bayesian network represents the joint probability\ndistribution of all variables in the domain. The topology of the network gives direct\ninformation about the dependency relationship between the variables involved.\nAs an example, assume that some application deals with the following variables: temperature\n(temp), excitation with voltage ( voltage), load ( load), amplitude of the acceleration ( amplitude)\nand frequency ( freq). Suppose for this example that voltage excitation of the transformer\nproduces an increase of the temperature and a variation on the load fed. Also, the load\nproduces an increment on the acceleration and variations of the frequency of this acceleration.\nThis knowledge can be represented in a Bayesian network as shown in Fig.4. In this case,\nthe arcs represent a relation of causality between the source and the destination of the arcs,\naccording to the text above. V ariables load and temperature are probabilistically dependent of\nvariable voltage. Also, variables frequency and amplitude are dependent on load.N o t i c e t h a t\nbesides the representation of the dependencies, the representation of the independences is an\nimportant concept in BN. In this example, frequency is probabilistically independent of voltage\ngiven load.A l s o ,amplitude is independent of temperature.\nUsing the dependency information represented in the network, and applying the chain rule,\nthe joint probability function of the set of variables in the application is given by:\nP(t, l, v, f , a)= P( fr e q| load )P(amplitude | load )P(load | voltage )P(temp | voltage )P(voltage )\nThis corresponds to the product of P(node i | parents (node i )).\nBesides the knowledge represented in the structure, i.e., dependencies and independencies,\nsome quantitative knowledge is required. This knowledge corresponds to the conditional\nprobability tables (CPT) of each node given its parent (corresponding to the term P(E | H)\nin the Bayes theorem) and a-priori probability for the root nodes (corresponding to the term\nP(H) in the Bayes theorem).\n110 Recent Advances in Vibrations Analysis\nwww.intechopen.com\nProbabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power T ransformers 9\nFig. 4. Example of a Bayesian network with 5 variables.\nThus, a complete probabilistic model using Bayesian networks is formed by the structure of\nthe network, and the CPT tables corresponding to each arc, and a-priori vectors corresponding\nto the root nodes (nodes without parent).\nOne of the advantages of using Bayesian networks is the three forms to acquire the required\nknowledge. First, with the participation of human experts in the domain, whocan explain the\ndependencies and independencies between the variables and also may suggest the conditional\nprobabilities. Second, with a great variety of automatic learning algorithms that utilize\nhistorical data to provide the structure, and the conditional probabilities corresponding to\nthe process where data was obtained (Neapolitan, 2004). Third, with a combination of the\nprevious two, i.e., using an automatic learning algorithm that allows the partic ipation of\nhuman experts in the deﬁnition of the structure.\nOnce that the probabilistic model has been constructed, it can be used to calculate t he\nprobability of some variables given some other input variables. This consists of assigning\na value to the input variables, and propagating their effect through the network to update the\nprobability of the hypotheses variables. The updating of the certainty measures is consistent\nwith probability theory , based on the application of Bayesian calculus and the dependencies\nrepresented in the network.\nFor example, in the network in Fig. 4, if load and temp are measured and freq is unknown, their\neffect can be propagated to obtain the posterior probability of freq given temp and load.\nSeveral algorithms have been proposed for this probability propagation. For singly connected\nnetworks, i.e., networks in what all nodes have at most one parent as in Fig. 4, there is\nan efﬁcient algorithm for probability propagation (Pearl, 1988). It consists on propagating\nthe effects of the known variables through the links, and combining them in each unknown\nvariable. This can be done by local operations and a message passing mechanism, in a time\nthat is linearly proportional to the diameter of the network. The most complete and expressive\nBayesian network representation is multiply connected networks. For these network s, there\nare alternative techniques for probability propagation, such as clustering, conditioning, and\nstochastic simulation (Pearl, 1988).\nThis project obtains historical data from different accelerometers collo cated in different parts\nof the prototype transformer . The transformer is operated at different conditio ns of load,\ntemperature, and excitation. The data acquired is fed to an automatic learning algorithm\nthat produces a probabilistic model of the vibrations in the transformer working under\ndifferent conditions. Thus, given new readings in a testing transformer , the model calculates\nthrough probabilistic propagation, the probability of certain vibration amplitudes at certa in\n111Probabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power Transformers\nwww.intechopen.com\n10 Vibration Analysis\nfrequencies. Therefore, a deviation of this behavior can be detected when reading the current\nvalues of acceleration and frequency . The next section explains this process detailed.\n4. Probabilistic vibration models\nT wo approaches were considered for the diagnosis of transformers based on vibration signals.\nThe ﬁrst approach consists of inserting failures in a transformer and mea sures the vibration\npattern according to the operational conditions. The diagnosis becomes a pattern re cognition\nprocedure according to the set of failures registered. Some examples of common failures are\nloosening the core or loosening the windings. These failures are similar to those failures\ncaused by strikes or short circuits. The second approach consists of the measurement of\nvibration signals of a correct transformer working at different operatio nal conditions. These\nmeasures allow the creation of a vibrational pattern of the transformer working properly . Only\none model is obtained in this approach. Only measures in a correct transformer are required.\nAs a consequence, this second approach is reported in this chapter , i.e., the construction of a\nmodel for the correct transformer .\nAdditionally , two sets of experiments were conducted. In the ﬁrst, experiments considered\nthe operational tests performed at the factory in the last steps of the construction of the\ntransformers. These tests increments the number of factory acceptance tests (F A T). The second\nset of experiments considers the normal operational conditions of the transformer and detects\nabnormal behavior in site (SA T).\nIn the next section, we include a description of the experiments conducted, and the\nconstruction of the model of correct transformer . Finally , we discuss the difference between\nFAT a n d S AT m o d e l s .\n4.1 Experiments\nThe creation of a model for the correct functioning of the transformer requires correct\ntransformers. The experiments were done at the Prolec-General Electric transform er factory\nin Monterrey , Mexico. W e had access to the production line at the last step of the new\ntransformers tests. W e installed 8 sensors around the transformer as shown in Fig. 5 : two in\neach side, one in the lower and the other in the upper part of every side. This array of sensors\npermits us to identify the speciﬁc points of the transformer where the vibrations si gnals can\nbe detected properly .\nExperiments in Prolec GE factory consisted in 19 different types of operational co nditions.\nT able 2 shows the operational conditions and the effect we wanted to study .\nT emperature\nExcitation Cold Hot Condition\nV oltage Effect of voltage Effect of voltage 70%, 80%, 90%,\nin core vibrations and temperature 100%, 110%\nin core vibrations\nCurrent Effect of current in Effect of current and 30%, 60%, 100%, 120%\nwinding package vibrations temperature in\nwinding package vibrations\nT able 2.

The experiments with cold transformer\nexcited with voltage and no current are used to study the effects of voltage in core vibrations.\nCold transformers excited with current and no voltage are used to study the effects of\ncurrent in winding packages. Hot transformers with voltage study effects of temperature and\nvibration in the core. Finally , hot transformers and current study the effects of temperature\nand vibrations in the winding. Additionally , the experiments that study the effects when\nexcited with current and no voltage, included variations between 30%, 60%, 100% and 120%\nof the nominal current for each transformer . Every transformer report its nominal current and\nnominal voltage. Similarly , the effects when excited with voltage and no current included\nvariations between 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% and 120% of the nominal voltage. In total, 19\ndifferent types of experiments were conducted to all the transformers.\n113Probabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power Transformers\nwww.intechopen.com\n12 Vibration Analysis\nFor each experiment, once that the transformer is prepared to a speciﬁc test, our data\nacquisition system collects vibration data at 5 K samples per second during two second s for\neach sensor .

Vibration signals when excited with voltage at sensor 2 in all frequencies.\naxis represents each one of the ten (or twelve) repetitions of each experiment with the same\noperational condition.\nFigure 7 shows the vibration signals when excited with current at 120 Hertz in all senso rs.\nNotice that the steps shown in the ﬁgure correspond to excitations of 30% of the nominal\ncurrent (lower amplitudes) and then 60%, 100% and 120%. Figure 8 shows the vibration\nsignals captured at sensor 2 in all the frequencies of the same experiment. Notice that the\namplitude of the vibration increases when current increases. Notice also that the freque ncies\nof 120 and 240 Hertz are the only representatives of the vibrations compared to other multiples\nof 60 Hertz.\nFigures 9 and 10 show the experiments with voltage and no current. Figure 9 shows the\nvibration signals at 120 Hetrz in all sensors, and Fig. 10 shows the vibration at sensor 2 in all\nfrequencies.\nThese graphs are examples of the kind of variations that we found in the vibrational patte rn,\nunder different operational conditions.\n115Probabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power Transformers\nwww.intechopen.com\n14 Vibration Analysis\nFollowing the transformation of the vibration signals in their frequency components, a\nnormalization procedure is applied. Normalization in this context means that all variabl e\nvalues lie between 0 and 1. This is because we only need to compare the behavior between all\nthe vibration signals. The normalization is obtained dividing all the vibration sig nals by the\nhighest measure of each sensor . Figure 11 shows an example of normalized signals. Notice\nthat all signals detected at all sensors behave similar even if their amplitude are different as\nwas shown in Fig. 7.\nFig. 11. Comparison between the behavior of all the signals when normalized.\nFinally , a discretization is required since the probabilistic model utilizes Bayesian networks\nwith discrete signals. Discretization is the division of the complete range of value s in a ﬁxed\nnumber of intervals. In our experiments, the vibration signals were discretized in 20 intervals\nor states S0 , S1 ,..., S19 . Since normalized, the states consists in 5% of the normalized signals,\ni.e., 0 − 0.05, 0.05 − 0.1 and so on.\nT able 3 resumes the variables utilized in the diagnosis and the values that they can take.\nVa r i a b l e Va l u e s\nT emperature Cold, hot\nExcitation V oltage, Current\nNominal V oltage 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%\nNominal Current 30%, 60%, 100%, 120%\nSensors A 1 , A 2 , ..., A 8\nFrequencies 6 0 H z . , 1 2 0 H z . , 1 8 0 H z . , ..., 9 0 0 H z . , 9 6 0 H z .\nT able 3.

Foll owing\nthe experts’ advice, we consider two possible set of models. The ﬁrst is a model relating\n116 Recent Advances in Vibrations Analysis\nwww.intechopen.com\nProbabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power T ransformers 15\noperational conditions and frequencies. One model for each sensor . The sec ond possible set\nof models relates operational conditions and sensors. One model for each frequ ency . W e\ndecided to try a set of models that relates conditions and sensors, i.e, o perational conditions\nand vibrations detected in certain parts of the transformer . Figure 12 shows one ins tance of\nthe resulting model.\n \n \n \nFig. 12. Model that relates operational conditions with the amplitude measured by each\nsensor .\nActually , the complete model is formed by two BNs like the one shown in Fig. 12. One\ncorresponding to the 120 Hz component and the second corresponding to 240 Hz. Once\ndeﬁned the structure, the EM (Estimation-Maximization) algorithm (Lauritzen, 1995) is\nutilized to obtain the conditional probability tables. W e used 10 experiments of each type as\nindicated in T able 2 and applied in 5 transformers. The structure and the parameter learned,\ncomplete the models for the diagnosis. Next section describes the diagnosis procedure in the\nfactory ﬂoor .\n4.3 Diagnosis procedure in F A T\nUtilizing the models described above, the algorithm 1 is applied to identify abnormal\nvibrations in the sensors given certain operational conditions:\nAlgorithm 1 Detection of abnormal vibrations.\nRequire: Operational conditions of temperature and excitation.\nassign a value (instantiate) to the temperature and excitation nodes\nfor all sensors (frequencies) in the network do\npropagate probabilities and obtain a posterior probability of all sensors (frequencies)\nnodes\ncompare the real value measure and the estimated value\nevaluate if there is an error in the sensor (frequency)\nend for\nAs an example, T able 4 shows the measures that have been obtained and normalized in the\nsensors of a cold transformer excited with 100% of nominal current.\nSensor 1 Sensor 2 Sensor 3 Sensor 4 Sensor 5 Sensor 6 Sensor 7 Sensor 8\n0.3284 0.3710 0.0895 0.4161 0.0811 0.7084 0.6531 0.2333\nT able 4. Example of vibration measured in the sensors.\nAccording to the algorithm 1, one sensor vibration is estimated using the rest of the sensor\nsignals and the operational conditions. The probabilistic propagation in the BN produc es a\n117Probabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power Transformers\nwww.intechopen.com\n16 Vibration Analysis\nposterior probability distribution of the estimated sensor value. The problem is to map the\nobserved value and the estimated value to a binary value: { correct , fa u l t y}. For example,\nFig. 13 left shows an example of a posterior probability distribution, and Fig. 13 right shows\na wider distribution. In both cases, the observed value of the estimated sensor is shown by\nan arrow . Intuitively , the ﬁrst case can be mapped as correct while the second can be taken as\nerroneous.\nFig. 13. Example of two posterior probabilistic distributions and the comparison with the\nvalue read.\nIn general, this decision can be made in a number of ways including the following.\n1. Calculate the distance of the real value from the average or mean of the distribution, and\nmap it to faulty if it is beyond a speciﬁed distance and to correct if it is less than a speciﬁed\ndistance.\n2. Assume that the sensor is working properly and establish a conﬁdence level at which this\nhypothesis can be rejected, in which case it can be considered faulty .\nThe ﬁrst criterion can be implemented by estimating the mean μ and standard deviation σ of\nthe posterior probability of each sensor , i.e., the distribution that results after the propagation.\nThen, a vibration can be assumed to be correct if it is in the range μ ± nσ ,w h e r en = 1, 2, 3.\nThis criterion allows working with wider distributions where the standard deviation is high\nand the real value is far from the mean μ value as shown in Fig. 13 right. However , this\ntechnique can have problems when the highest probability is close to one, i.e., the standard\ndeviation is close to zero. In such situations, the real value must coincide with that interval.\nThe second criterion assumes as a null-hypothesis that the sensor is working properly . The\nprobability of obtaining the observed value given this null-hypothesis is then calculated.\nIf this value, known as the p-value (Cohen, 1995), is less than a speciﬁed level, then\nthe hypothesis is rejected and the sensor considered faulty . Both criteria were evaluate d\nexperimentally . Here, it is worth mentioning that using the p-value w i t ha0 . 0 1r e j e c t i o nl e v e l ,\nworks well.\n4.4 Experiments for F A T\nW e designed a computational program that utilize the measurements obtained in the\nexperiments described in T able 2. W e run experiments and identify if there is a failure.\nAn experiment consists in establishing the operational conditions of excitation and\ntemperature. Next, the system obtain the measurements of the sensors, and executes the\n118 Recent Advances in Vibrations Analysis\nwww.intechopen.com\nProbabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power T ransformers 17\nalgorithm for detection of abnormal vibrations. Since we have 16 indicators of fault (eight\nsensors in two frequencies), a sensor fusion technique is required. W e de cided to make a\nweighted sum of the conclusion of each sensor . If one sensor issensible and detects deviations\neasily , then a low weight is assigned. Other less sensible sensors may have higher weights.\nGiven the sum of each frequency , we can conﬁgure ranks for declare a transformer as {correct,\nsuspicious, faulty}.\n \nFig. 14. User interface of the diagnosis software (in Spanish).\nFigure 14 shows the results of one experiment (in Spanish). In the upper le ft of the window ,\nthe operational conditions are indicated. First, load (carga en %) with 100% of current, and\ncool transformer temperature (frio). In the middle left of the window , there are two lights. One\ncorresponds to a model for 120 Hz. and the other corresponds to 240 Hz. As mentioned above,\nwe are using one model for each frequency . These lights become green if the transformer is\ncorrect, yellow if the transformer is suspicious and red if there is deﬁnite a failure. Below , in\nthe lower left of the window , there are a little box for each sensor in the transformer . The ﬁrst\n8 corresponding to 120Hz and the last corresponding to 240 Hz. If the posterior probability\nobtained in a node (sensor) corresponds to the vibrational value currently detected , then an\nOK mark is described, and a NO-OK mark otherwise. Notice that the sixth sensor detected\na deviation in the model of 240 Hz. In the upper right of the window , four rows of data\nare included. The ﬁrst two correspond to the current vibration amplitude measured i n the\n8 sensors in the transformer . The next two rows correspond to the normalized i nformation.\nThey are actually the inputs to the BNs. The lower right part of the window displays othe r\nprototype information.\n119Probabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power Transformers\nwww.intechopen.com\n18 Vibration Analysis\nSeveral transformers have been tested in factory and some faults have been detected. The next\nsection describes the changes made to the model in order to run SA T tests.\n4.5 Preliminary experiments for SA T\nExperiments in site have certain differences with F A T experiments. The main difference is that\ntransformers always operate at their ﬁxed nominal voltage but variable current. The current\nvalue corresponds to the demanded power by the consumers.\nIn order to utilize the information acquired in F A T experiments, one assumption was\nnecessary: vibration corresponds to the sum of vibration by current (produced at the winding)\nplus vibration by ﬁxed voltage at 100% of nominal value (produced at the core). This\nassumption is valid at the transformer operational condition below the saturation condi tion.\nV oltage is always ﬁxed at its nominal value (controlled by the grid), and the current is always\ntried to keep in normal conditions. In reality , we use all the information acquired for F A T\nexperiments, modiﬁed with this assumption.\nAdditionally , we run experiments in power transformers working on site. Of course, we could\nnot modify the working conditions and we took only data in certain loads.\nT able 5 shows an example of the experiments carried out at the power transformer in Prolec\nGE substation. The transformer provides power to the entire plant. Columns indicate the\nmeasurement obtained by all every sensor . The ﬁrst row indicates the real amplitude obtained\nby the sensor and normalized. Once normalized, the signals are discretized in 2 0 intervals.\nThe second row indicates the interval number , from 0 to 19. Third row indicates the posterior\nprobability obtained after the propagation in the probabilistic model. This number indicates\nthe probability of being a normal measurement, so the fourth row decides if there is a failure\n(1 value) or there is no failure (0 value). This decision is based on the assumption that the\nposterior probability distribution is Gaussian given certain operational conditions. Thus, the\nreal value measured is compared with ±σ from the media.\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8\nReal value measured 0.159 0.121 0.184 0.178 0.083 0.016 0.729 0.141\nCorresponding interval 3 2 3 3 1 0 14 2\nPosterior probability 0.312 0.312 0.0 0.0 0.687 0.0 0.0 0.375\nDecision 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\nT able 5. Example of one experiment.\nFor example in T able 5 , sensor 2 measured a normalized value of 0.121 that corresponds to\nthe interval number 2. Propagation indicates 31% of the value that corresponds to no failure.\nOn the contrary , sensor 7 reads a normalized value of 0.729, corresponding to interval 14 and\nthere is no probability of being correct. The decision is 1. Notice however , that sensor 6 has\nthe same 0 probability but the standard deviation may be very wide and the decision marked\n0.\nThe prototype was constructed using thehugin platform (Andersen et al., 1989), so the off–line\nautomatic learning and the on–line propagation are carried out with the Java APIs of this\npackage.\nSeveral tests were made in this Prolec GE substation transformer and the model resulted in a\ncorrect tool for transformer diagnosis.\n120 Recent Advances in Vibrations Analysis\nwww.intechopen.com\nProbabilistic Vibration Models in the Diagnosis of Power T ransformers 19\n5. Conclusions and future work\nThe main contribution of this work is the construction of a probabilistic vibration model\nobtained with the vibration signals measured in a power transformer . Thus, i f a model of\ncorrect behavior can be obtained, then early deviations of this behavior can also be achi eved.\nOur approach utilizes Bayesian networks as the formalism for constructing and utilizing the\nmodels. W e used 8 sensors situated all around the tank of the transformer . Every me asure\nwas transformed to the frequency domain and only amplitude multiples of the 60 Hz were\nconsidered. Experiments were carried out at different operational conditions to construct the\nmodels. Finally , a diagnosis program receives vibration data from a transfo rmer , inserting it\nas evidence and probability propagation allows calculating the probability of proper behavior .\nBayesian networks have the advantage of generate conclusions even when the evidence is\nincomplete. This means that even with less sensors or less frequencies, a conclusion can be\nobtained. Also, BNs include several algorithms that automatically adapt the models, based on\nvibration in the normal life of the transformer . This means we can detect the normal behavior\nof old transformers even if they vibrate much more that their vibration when new .\nFuture work is needed in the determination of additional operation conditions variabl es, like\nparameters in the construction of each transformer . W e can detect the vibration transmission\nbetween different parts of the transformer and identify more clearly if the behavior is normal\nor not.\nFinal results will be available after months of tests in new and old transformers, in site and at\nthe factory .\n6.
