  "abstract": "The research for new mineral oil substitutes focuses on vegetable oils known for their biodegradability and low toxicity.This paper focuses on the development and analysis of physicochemical and dielectric properties of a bio-based insulating liquid from castor oil.Castor oil is an inedible tropical resource.It has a good annual oil yield and is widely available in developing countries.Cold pressing of castor seeds is the most appropriate non-chemical process for extracting oil.A refining process was used to remove metal and chemical residues.Refined Castor Oil was filtered and degassed in order to minimize the dissolved gases, solid particles and moisture.A transesterification operation was performed to significantly reduce viscosity oil.Finally, obtained Castor Oil Methyl Esters (COME) are finally distilled in a rotary evaporator under vacuum to remove traces of water and methanol.Physicochemical properties as visual examination, relative density, kinematic viscosity, and acidity were measured in accordance with ASTM D6871.AC Breakdown voltage was performed according to IEC 60156, and had been analyzed using Weibull distribution.Processed Castor Oil (PCO) has low viscosity than certified transformer vegetable oils (BIOTEMP, FR3) and high Dielectric Strength (74.67 kV/2.5 mm).Partial Discharges characteristics including the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage and the Partial Discharge Propagation Voltage were also investigated according to the recommendations of IEC 61294.PCO has satisfactory properties for their use as an insulating oil for transformer.",
