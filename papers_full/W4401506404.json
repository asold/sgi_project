    "abstract": "The growing demand for efficient and scalable AI solutions has driven research into optimizing the performance and energy efficiency of computational infrastructures. The novel concept of redesigning inference clusters and modifying the GPT-Neo model offers a significant advancement in addressing the computational and environmental challenges associated with AI deployment. By developing a novel cluster architecture and implementing strategic architectural and algorithmic changes, the research achieved substantial improvements in throughput, latency, and energy consumption. The integration of advanced interconnect technologies, high-bandwidth memory modules, and energy-efficient power management techniques, alongside software optimizations, enabled the redesigned clusters to outperform baseline models significantly. Empirical evaluations demonstrated superior scalability, robustness, and environmental sustainability, emphasizing the potential for more sustainable AI technologies. The findings underscore the importance of balancing performance with energy efficiency and provide a robust framework for future research and development in AI optimization. The research contributes valuable insights into the design and deployment of more efficient and environmentally responsible AI systems.",
