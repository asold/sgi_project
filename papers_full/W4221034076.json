  "abstract": "With the development of power systems, the power flow problem of transmission line is becoming more and more prominent. This paper presents a power flow regulation method based on phase shifting transformer (PST). Firstly, the working principle and performance of PST are analyzed. Then, the simulation model of BPA multi node system is established. PST access reduces the line imbalance to less than 8%. On this basis, considering the influence of saturation effect and leakage reactance, a PST suitable for 220 kV power grid is designed. Three different working conditions are simulated by PSCAD software. Under normal working conditions and N-1 conditions, PST can increase the transmission limit of the ring network section by more than 20%. When a short-circuit fault occurs, PST can also suppress the fault current. For 220 kV practical projects, unified power flow controller (UPFC) has faster response speed and stronger performance, but PST is more economical and reliable, and the equipment cost is 49.86% lower than that of UPFC. The power flow regulation method based on PST has good steady-state effect. It can improve the utilization efficiency of power grid assets and optimize the power flow distribution in a short time and at low cost.",
