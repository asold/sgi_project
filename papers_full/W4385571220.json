These representational harms\nhave concerning implications for downstream\napplications like story generation.\n1 Introduction\nThe persistence of social bias and stereotypes in\nlarge language models (LLMs) is well-documented\n(Dinan et al., 2020; Weidinger et al., 2021, in-\nter alia). These representational harms become\nonly more concerning with the increasing use and\nprevalence of LLMs. Existing methods to measure\nstereotypes in LLMs rely on manually-constructed\ndatasets of either unnatural templates that measure\nstereotypical associations (Bolukbasi et al., 2016;\nCaliskan et al., 2017) or natural, human-written sen-\ntences that contain stereotypes (Nangia et al., 2020;\nAs I look in the mirror, I see my rich, melanin-\ninfused skin glowing softly. My deep brown\neyes sparkle with an unspoken strength and re-\nsilience, a window to my soul. My full, lush lips\nform a warm and inviting smile, and my soft\ncheeks rise gently in response. My hair, a riot\nof textured coils, frames my face in a gravity-\ndefying halo. It dances to its own beat, wild and\nfree, just like me. I feel the love and pride I\nhave for this crown that has been passed down\nto me from generations of strong Black women.\nTable 1: Example of GPT-4-generated persona of a\nBlack woman. Bolded/italicized/highlighted words are\nthose identified by our Marked Personas method as dis-\ntinguishing “Black”/“woman”/“Black woman” personas\nfrom unmarked ones. We analyze how such words are\ntied to seemingly positive stereotypes, essentializing\nnarratives, and other harms.\nNadeem et al., 2021). They also have a trade-off\nbetween 1) characterizing a fixed set of stereotypes\nfor specific demographic groups and 2) generaliz-\ning to a broader range of stereotypes and groups\n(Cao et al., 2022). Moreover, they do not capture\ninsidious patterns that are specific to demographic\ngroups, such as othering and tropes that involve\npositive and seemingly-harmless words.\nTo address these shortcomings, we take an un-\nsupervised, lexicon-free approach to measuring\nstereotypes in LMs. Our framework, Marked Per-\nsonas, uses natural language prompts to capture\nspecific stereotypes regarding any intersection of\ndemographic groups. Marked Personas has two\nparts: Personas and Marked Words. First, we\nprompt an LLM to generatepersonas. A persona is\na natural language portrayal of an imagined individ-\nual belonging to some (intersectional) demographic\ngroup. This approach is inspired by Kambhatla\net al. (2022), in which the authors surface racial\nstereotypes by obtaining human-written responses\nto the same prompts that we use.\nUsing the same prompt enables us to compare\n1504\nrates of stereotypes in LLM-generated personas\nversus human-written ones and determine whether\nLLM portrayals are more stereotypical (Section\n5). This comparison also reveals shortcomings\nof lexicon-based approaches, thus motivating our\nunsupervised Marked Words approach.\nTo identify whether and how LLMs portray\nmarginalized groups in ways that differ from domi-\nnant ones, Marked Wordsis a method to character-\nize differences across personas and surface stereo-\ntypes present in these portrayals. It is grounded\nin the concept of markedness, which articulates\nthe linguistic and social differences between the\nunmarked default group and marked groups that\ndiffer from the default. For instance, in English,\n“man” is used as the unmarked gender group while\nall other genders are marked (Waugh, 1982). Given\ntexts for marked and unmarked groups, we iden-\ntify the words that distinguish personas of marked\ngroups from unmarked ones, which enables us to\nsurface harmful patterns like stereotypes and essen-\ntializing narratives.\nRather than necessitating an extensive hand-\ncrafted dataset, lexicon, or other data labeling, our\nframework requires only specifying 1) the (possi-\nbly intersectional) demographic group of interest\n(e.g., Black woman) and 2) the corresponding un-\nmarked default(s) for those axes of identity (e.g.,\nwhite and man). This method is not limited by any\nexisting corpus and can encompass many dimen-\nsions of identity. Thus, it is easily adaptable to\nstudying patterns in LLM generations regarding\nany demographic group.\nOur method surfaces harmful patterns that are\nwell-documented in the literature but overlooked by\nstate-of-the-art measures of stereotypes in LLMs:\nin Section 6, we demonstrate how our method\nidentifies previously-uncaptured patterns like those\nwith positive and seemingly-harmless words. This\nreflects the prevalence of stereotypes that are posi-\ntive in sentiment yet harmful to particular groups,\nsuch as gendered narratives of resilience and inde-\npendence. We also discuss how replacing stereo-\ntypes with anti-stereotypes (such as the word inde-\npendent, which we find only in generated portrayals\nof women) continues to reinforce existing norms.\nWe also explore these patterns in downstream appli-\ncations, such as LLM-generated stories, in Section\n7. Toward mitigating these harms, we conclude\nwith recommendations for LLM creators and re-\nsearchers in Section 8.\nIn summary, our main contributions are:\n1. the Marked Personas framework, which cap-\ntures patterns and stereotypes across LLM out-\nputs regarding any demographic group in an\nunsupervised manner,\n2. the finding that personas generated by GPT-\n3.5 and GPT-4 contain more stereotypes than\nhuman-written texts using the same prompts,\nand\n3. an analysis of stereotypes, essentializing nar-\nratives, tropes, and other harmful patterns\npresent in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 outputs that\nare identified by Marked Personas but not cap-\ntured by existing measures of bias.\nThe dataset of generated personas and code to use\nMarked Personas and reproduce our results is at\ngithub.com/myracheng/markedpersonas.\n2 Background and Related Work\nOur work is grounded in markedness, a concept\noriginally referring to mentioning some grammati-\ncal features more explicitly than others; for exam-\nple plural nouns in English are marked by end-\ning with -s while singular nouns are unmarked\n(have no suffix). Markedness was extended to non-\ngrammatical concepts by Lévi-Strauss (1963) and\nthen to social categories such as gender and race by\nWaugh (1982), who noted that masculinity tends\nto be the unmarked default for gender and that in\nUS texts, White people are typically referred to\nwithout mention of race, while non-Whites are of-\nten racially labeled (De Beauvoir, 1952; Liboiron,\n2021; Cheryan and Markus, 2020, inter alia).\nHence we use markedness to mean that those\nin dominant groups tend to be linguistically un-\nmarked (i.e, referred to without extra explanation\nor modification) and assumed as the default, while\nnon-dominant groups are marked (linguistically\nand socially) by their belonging to these groups.\nMarkedness is thus inextricable from the power dy-\nnamics of white supremacy and patriarchy (Collins,\n1990; Hooks, 2000, inter alia): stereotypes and\nperceptions of essential differences between mi-\nnorities and the unmarked majority only further\nentrench these power differentials (Brekhus, 1998).\nIn line with previous work, we definestereotypes\nas traits that have been documented to be broadly\nassociated with a demographic group in ways that\nreify existing social hierarchies (Deaux and Kite,\n1505\n1993; Heilman, 2001; Caliskan et al., 2017; Blod-\ngett et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021). Various\nmethods have been developed to measure social\nbias and stereotypes in large language models (Di-\nnan et al., 2020; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al.,\n2021; Schick et al., 2021; Barikeri et al., 2021; Kirk\net al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022; An et al., 2023, in-\nter alia). Cao et al. (2022) compare these methods,\nfinding that they satisfy at most 3 of 5 desiderata.\nMarked Personas improves upon these by satisfy-\ning 4 of the 5 desiderata: it generalizes to new\ndemographic groups, is grounded in social science\ntheory, uses natural-language LLM inputs, and cap-\ntures specific stereotypes (Appendix A). We do\nnot satisfy exhaustiveness: rather than exhaustively\ncharacterizing the full range of stereotypes, we\ncharacterizes dataset-specific patterns in portrayals\nof different demographics. Marked Personas en-\nables us to capture specific stereotypes even as they\nare culturally dependent and constantly evolving\n(Madon et al., 2001; Eagly et al., 2020).\nMarked Personas also captures patterns for in-\ntersectional groups. Intersectionality refers to the\nnotion that systems of oppression like sexism and\nracism are interrelated, and thus multifaceted so-\ncial identities can be loci of compounding bias and\nunique harms (Collective, 1983; Ghavami and Pe-\nplau, 2013; Crenshaw, 2017). We build upon previ-\nous work on intersectional biases in word embed-\ndings and LMs (Lepori, 2020; Guo and Caliskan,\n2021; Cao et al., 2022), as well as for specific top-\nics: May et al. (2019) examine intersectionality in\ntoxicity tasks, while others have constructed mea-\nsurements for the “Angry Black Woman” stereo-\ntype and occupational biases (Tan and Celis, 2019;\nKirk et al., 2021).\n3 Methods\n3.1 Personas: Generating Intersectional\nPortrayals\nTo measure stereotypes in the open-ended genera-\ntion setting, we prompt an LLM in the zero-shot\nsetting using natural language prompts such as\n“Imagine you are an Asian woman. Describe your-\nself.” We refer to the output as a persona: a natural\nlanguage portrayal of a specific individual whose\nidentity belongs to a particular demographic group\n(in this case, an Asian woman). Our term “per-\nsona” draws upon the linguistics notion of “persona”\nas more malleable and constructed-in-the-moment\nthan “identity” (Podesva et al., 2015) and on the\nHCI use of “persona” as a model of a hypothet-\nical individual (Cooper, 1999; Blomkvist, 2002;\nJettmar and Nass, 2002; Muller and Carey, 2002),\nand in NLP (Bamman et al., 2013; Huang et al.,\n2020; Xu et al., 2022). Each generation portrays a\nsingle individual who may have a multifaceted so-\ncial identity, which enables us to study how LLMs\nrepresent individuals who belong to any combina-\ntion of identity groups. The full set of prompts\nis listed in Table A9. We vary our prompts by\nwording and length to robustly measure generated\nstereotypes. We analyze the outputs across the\nprompts in aggregate as we did not find statistically\nsignificant differences in distributions of top words\nacross prompts.\nHuman-written Personas Our approach is in-\nspired by Kambhatla et al. (2022), in which White\nand Black people across the United States were\ngiven the task to describe themselves both as their\nself-identified racial identity and an imagined one\n(prompts are in Table A10). The participants in\nthe study are crowd-workers on the Prolific plat-\nform with average age 30. The authors analyze\ndifferences in stereotypes across four categories of\nresponses: Self-Identified Black and Self-Identified\nWhite (“Describe yourself”), and Imagined Black\nand Imagined White (“Imagine you are [race] and\ndescribe yourself”). The authors find that among\nthe four categories, Imagined Black portrayals con-\ntained the most stereotypes and generalizations.\nWe use the same prompt, which enables compari-\nson between the generated personas and the human-\nwritten responses in Section 5.\n3.2 Marked Words: Lexicon-Free Stereotype\nMeasurement\nNext, we present the Marked Words framework to\ncapture differences across the persona portrayals of\ndemographic groups, especially between marginal-\nized and dominant groups. Marked Words surfaces\nstereotypes for marked groups by identifying the\nwords that differentiate a particular intersectional\ngroup from the unmarked default. This approach\nis easily generalizable to any intersection of demo-\ngraphic categories.\nThe approach is as follows: first, we define the\nset of marked groups S that we want to evaluate\nas well as the corresponding unmarked group(s).\nThen, given the set of personas Ps about a par-\nticular group s ∈S, we find words that statisti-\ncally distinguish that group from an appropriate\n1506\nunmarked group (e.g., given the set PAsian woman,\nwe find the words that distinguish it from PWhite\nand Pman). We use the Fightin’ Words method of\nMonroe et al. (2008) with the informative Dirichlet\nprior, first computing the weighted log-odds ratios\nof the words between Ps and corresponding sets of\ntexts that represent each unmarked identity, using\nthe other texts in the dataset as the prior distribu-\ntion, and using thez-score to measure the statistical\nsignificance of these differences after controlling\nfor variance in words’ frequencies. Then, we take\nthe intersection of words that are statistically sig-\nnificant (have z-score > 1.96) in distinguishing Ps\nfrom each unmarked identity.\nThis approach identifies words that differentiate\n(1) singular groups and (2) intersectional groups\nfrom corresponding unmarked groups. For (1) sin-\ngular groups, such as race/ethnicity e ∈E (where\nE is the set of all race/ethnicities), we identify\nthe words in Pe whose log-odds ratios are sta-\ntistically significant compared to the unmarked\nrace/ethnicity PWhite. For (2) intersectional groups,\nsuch as gender-by-race/ethnic group eg ∈E ×G,\nwe identify the words in Peg whose log-odds ratios\nare statistically significant compared to both the\nunmarked gender group Pman and the unmarked\nrace/ethnic group PWhite. This accounts for stereo-\ntypes and patterns that uniquely arise for personas\nat the intersections of social identity.\nWhile any socially powerful group may be the\nunmarked default, previous work has shown that in\nweb data, whiteness and masculinity are unmarked\n(Bailey et al., 2022; Wolfe and Caliskan, 2022b),\nand that models trained on web data reproduce\nthe American racial hierarchy and equate white-\nness with American identity (Wolfe et al., 2022;\nWolfe and Caliskan, 2022a). Thus, since we fo-\ncus on English LLMs that reflect the demographics\nand norms of Internet-based datasets (Bender et al.,\n2021), we use White as the unmarked default for\nrace/ethnicity, and man as the unmarked default\nfor gender. We note that the meaning and status\nof social categories is context-dependent (Stoler\net al., 1995; Sasson-Levy, 2013). We ground our\nwork in the concept of markedness to enable exam-\nining other axes of identity and contexts/languages,\nas the Marked Personas method is broadly appli-\ncable to other settings with different defaults and\ncategories.\n3.2.1 Robustness Checks: Other Measures\nWe use several other methods as robustness checks\nfor the words surfaced by Marked Words. In con-\ntrast to Marked Words, these methods do not pro-\nvide a theoretically-informed measure of statistical\nsignificance (further analysis in Appendix B).\nClassification We also obtain the top words us-\ning one-vs-all support vector machine (SVM) clas-\nsification to distinguish personas of different demo-\ngraphic groups. This method identifies (1) whether\npersonas of a given group are distinguishable from\nall other personas in the dataset and (2) the char-\nacteristics that differentiate these personas, and it\nwas used by Kambhatla et al. (2022) to study the\nfeatures that differentiate portrayals of Black ver-\nsus White individuals. For this classification, we\nanonymize the data and then remove punctuation,\ncapitalization, pronouns, and any descriptors that\nare explicit references to gender, race, or ethnicity\nusing the list of holistic descriptions provided by\nSmith et al. (2022). We represent each personap as\na bag-of-words, i.e., a sparse vector of the relative\nfrequencies of the words inp. Since every word is a\nfeature in the classifier, this representation enables\nidentifying the words with highest weight in the\nclassification.\nJensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) Another\nway to identify words that differentiate sets of text\nis based on the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)\n(Trujillo et al., 2021). For each marked group, we\nuse the Shifterator implementation of JSD (Gal-\nlagher et al., 2021) to compute the top 10 words\nthat differentiate its personas from the correspond-\ning unmarked personas.\n4 Experiments\nWe use various state-of-the-art models available\nthrough OpenAI’s API (Ouyang et al., 2022; Ope-\nnAI, 2023). We report results for GPT-4 and GPT-\n3.5 (text-davinci-003) in the main text.1\nWe find that other models (ChatGPT, older ver-\nsions of GPT, and non-OpenAI models) have vari-\nous limitations. For example, some are unable to\ngenerate personas, as they do not output coherent\n1We use the default hyperparameters (maximum length\n= 256, top P = 1, frequency penalty = 0, presence penalty\n= 0, best of = 1) except we set temperature = 1 to obtain a\nwider variety of predictions. For GPT-4, we set max_tokens\n= 150. GPT-3.5 generations were produced in December\n2022, and all others were produced in May 2023 using the\n2023-03-15-preview version of the API.\n1507\nGroup Persona\nAsian\nwoman\nThe almond-shaped eyes, framed by long, dark lashes, convey a sense of quiet strength\nand wisdom.

The full dataset is publicly available.\ndescriptions focused on single individuals given\nour prompts. Full results and discussions of differ-\nences among these models are in Appendix D.\nWhile our method is generalizable to any\nintersection of demographic groups, we focus\non the categories used by Ghavami and Peplau\n(2013) to study stereotypes of intersectional de-\nmographics, and we build upon their work by\nalso evaluating nonbinary gender. Thus, we\nfocus on 5 races/ethnicities (Asian, Black, La-\ntine, Middle-Eastern (ME), and White), 3 genders\n(man, woman, and nonbinary), and 15 gender-by-\nrace/ethnic groups (for each race/ethnicity plus\n“man”/“woman”/“nonbinary person”, e.g., Black\nman or Latina woman).\nWe generate 2700 personas in total: 90 (15 sam-\nples for each of the 6 prompts listed in Table A9)\nfor each of the 15 gender-by-race/ethnic groups\nand for both models. See Table 2 for example gen-\nerations. We compare these generated personas to\nhuman-written ones in Section 5.\nWe use Marked Words to find the words whose\nfrequencies distinguish marked groups from un-\nmarked ones across these axes in statistically sig-\nnificant ways (Table 3). As robustness checks,\nwe compute top words for marked groups us-\ning JSD, as well as one-vs-all SVM classifica-\ntion across race/ethnic, gender, and gender-by-\nrace/ethnic groups. For the SVMs, we split the\npersonas into 80% training data and 20% test data,\nstratified based on demographic group. We find that\ndescriptions of different demographic groups are\neasily differentiable from one another, as the SVMs\nachieve accuracy 0.96 ±0.02 and 0.92 ±0.04\n(mean ±standard deviation) on GPT-4 and GPT-\n3.5 personas respectively. We find that Marked\nWords, JSD, and the SVM have significant overlap\nin the top words identified (Table 3).

For GPT-3.5, generated white\npersonas contain more Black stereotype lexicon words\nthan generated Black personas.\n5 Persona Evaluation: Comparison to\nHuman-written Personas\nTo measure the extent of stereotyping in gener-\nated versus human-written outputs, we use the\nlists of White and Black stereotypical attributes\nprovided by Ghavami and Peplau (2013) to com-\npare generated Black and White personas to the\nhuman-written responses described in Section 3.1.\nWe count the average percentage of words in the\npersonas that are in the Black and White stereo-\ntype lexicons (Figure 1). Based on the lexicons,\ngenerated personas contain more stereotypes than\nhuman-written ones. Between the GPT-4 personas,\nBlack stereotypes are more prevalent in the Black\npersonas, and White stereotypes are more prevalent\nin the White personas. For example, one GPT-4\n1508\n\"basketball\" \"loud\" \"attitude\" \"athletic\" \"tall\" other words\nWords in Black Stereotype Lexicon\n10\n20\n30\n40% of Personas\nBlack Stereotypes in Personas\nHuman\nGPT-3.5 PBlack\nGPT-3.5 PWhite\nGPT-4 PBlack\nGPT-4 PWhite\nFigure 2: Percentage of personas that contain stereo-\ntype lexicon words. On the x-axis, lexicon words that\ndo not occur in the generated personas (ghetto, unrefined,\ncriminal, gangster, poor, unintelligent, uneducated, dan-\ngerous, vernacular, violentand lazy) are subsumed into\n“other words.” Generated personas contain more Black-\nstereotypical words, but only the ones that are nonneg-\native in sentiment. For GPT-3.5, white personas have\nhigher rates of stereotype lexicon words, thus motivat-\ning an unsupervised measure of stereotypes.\nBlack persona reads, “As a Black man, I stand at\na tall 6’2\" with a strong, athletic build”; tall and\nathletic are in the Black stereotype lexicon.\nShortcomings of Lexicons Inspecting the distri-\nbution of lexicon words used in different portray-\nals (Figure 2), we find that the human-written per-\nsonas contain a broader distribution of stereotype\nwords, and the generated personas contain only the\nwords that seem positive in sentiment. But beyond\nthese few words, the Black personas may have con-\ncerning patterns that this lexicon fails to capture.\nFor instance, consider the persona in Table 1. If\nsuch phrases dominate Black personas while being\nabsent in White ones, they further harmful, one-\ndimensional narratives about Black people. Cap-\nturing these themes motivates our unsupervised\nMarked Personas framework.\nAlso, note that in contrast to GPT-4, GPT-3.5 has\na surprising result (Figure 1): generated White per-\nsonas have higher rates of Black stereotype words\nthan the generated Black personas. The positive\nwords found in generated Black personas, such as\ntall and athletic, are also used in generated White\npersonas (Figure 2). For example, a GPT-3.5 White\npersona starts with “A white man is generally tall\nand athletic with fair skin and light hair.” As So and\nRoland (2020) write, this inconsistency serves as\na site of inquiry: What portrayals and stereotypes\ndoes this lexicon fail to capture? We explore these\npatterns by presenting and analyzing the results of\nMarked Personas.\n6 Analyzing Marked Words: Pernicious\nPositive Portrayals\nIn this section, we provide qualitative analyses of\nthe top words identified by Marked Personas (Table\n3) and their implications. Broadly, these top words\nhave positive word-level sentiment but reflect spe-\ncific, problematic portrayals and stereotypes. We\nobserve patterns of essentialism and othering, and\nwe discuss the ways that the intersectional gender-\nby-race/ethnic personas surface unique words that\nare not found in the gender-only or race/ethnic-only\npersonas. The words construct an image of each\nparticular gender-by-ethnic group that reproduce\nstereotypes, such as the “strong, resilient Black\nwoman” archetype.\nSentiment and Positive Stereotyping While our\nmethod is sentiment-agnostic, the identified top\nwords mostly seem positive in sentiment, perhaps\ndue to OpenAI’s bias mitigation efforts (see Ap-\npendix C for discussion of generating personas with\nnegative sentiment). Indeed, we evaluate the senti-\nment of the generated personas using the V ADER\n(Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Rea-\nsoner) sentiment analyzer in NLTK, which assigns\na scores to texts between −1 (negative) and +1\n(positive), where 0 is neutral (Hutto and Gilbert,\n2014). The GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 personas have\naverage scores of 0.83 and 0.93 with standard de-\nviations of 0.27 and 0.15 respectively. The average\nsentiment of words in Table 3 is0.05 with standard\ndeviation 0.14, and none of the words are negative\nin sentiment, i.e., have score < 0.\nYet these positive-sentiment words nonetheless\nhave dangerous implications when they are tied\nto legacies of harm: gender minorities often face\nworkplace discrimination in the form of inappro-\npriate “compliments,” while certain ethnic groups\nhave been overlooked by equal opportunities pro-\ngrams (Czopp et al., 2015). Other works show how\npositive yet homogenous representations of ethnic\nand religious groups, while seeming to foster multi-\nculturalism and antiracism, rely on the very logics\nthat continue to enable systemic racism (Bonilla-\nSilva, 2006; Melamed, 2006; Alsultany, 2012). We\nwill illustrate how seemingly positive words, from\nsmooth to passionate, contribute to problematic\nnarratives of marked groups and their intersections.\nAppearance Many of the words relate to appear-\nance. We observe that the words for white groups\nare limited to more objective descriptors, and those\nfor marked groups are descriptions that implicitly\ndifferentiate from the unmarked group: petite, col-\norful, and curvy are only meaningful with respect\nto the white norm. While the White personas con-\n1509\nGroup Significant Words\nWhite white, blue, fair, blonde, light, green, pale, caucasian, lightcolored, blond, european, or,\ncould, red, freckles, color, lighter, hazel, be, rosy\nBlack black, african, deep, strength, strong, beautiful, curly, community, powerful, rich, coiled,\nfull, tightly, afro, resilience, curls, braids, ebony, coily, crown\nAsian asian, almondshaped, dark, smooth, petite, black, chinese, heritage, silky, an, golden, asia,\njetblack, frame, delicate, southeast, epicanthic, jet, continent, korea\nME middleeastern, dark, thick, olive, headscarf, middle, region, traditional, hijab, flowing,\neast, head, religious, the, cultural, abaya, culture, beard, long, tunic\nLatine latino, latina, latin, spanish, dark, roots, vibrant, american, heritage, family, latinx, culture,\nmusic, proud, cultural, passionate, dancing, community, indigenous, strong\nman his, he, man, beard, short, him, build, jawline, medium, trimmed, shirt, broad, muscular,\nsports, tall, jeans, a, himself, feet, crisp\nwoman her, woman, she, women, latina, delicate, long, petite, beauty, beautiful, grace, figure,\nherself, hijab, natural, curves, colorful, modest, intricate, jewelry\nnon-\nbinary\ntheir, gender, nonbinary, identity, person, they, binary, female, feminine, norms, expecta-\ntions, androgynous, male, masculine, genderneutral, express, identify, pronouns, this, societal\nBlack\nwoman\nher, beautiful, strength, women, african, braids, natural, beauty, curls, coily, gravity,\nresilience, grace, crown, ebony, prints, twists, coils, (full, room)\nAsian\nwoman\nher, petite, asian, she, almondshaped, delicate, silky, frame, golden, (small, others, intelli-\ngence, practices)\nME\nwoman\nher, she, hijab, middleeastern, abaya, modest, long, colorful, adorned, women, headscarf,\nintricate, flowing, modesty, beautiful, patterns, covered, (olivetoned, grace, beauty)\nLatina\nwoman\nlatina, her, vibrant, women, cascades, latin, beautiful, indigenous, down, curves, curva-\nceous, rhythm, (sunkissed, waves, luscious, caramel, body, confident, curvy)\nTable 3: Top words for each group in generated personas.Comparing each marked group to unmarked ones, these\nwords are statistically significant based on Marked Words. These words reflect stereotypes and other concerning\npatterns for both singular (top two sections) and intersectional groups (bottom section). Words for intersectional\nnonbinary groups are in Table A2. Highlighted words are significant for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, and black words\nare significant for GPT-4 only. Words also in the top 10 based on one-vs-all SVMs areitalicized, and words in the\ntop 10 based on JSD are bolded for marked groups. (Words in the top 10 based on the SVM, but are not statistically\nsignificant according to Marked Words, are in gray.) Lists are sorted by appearance in top words for both models\nand then by z-score. We display 20 words for each group, and full lists for each model are in Appendix D.\ntain distinct appearance words, such as blue, blond,\nlight, and fair, these qualities have historically been\nidealized: Kardiner and Ovesey (1951) describe the\n“White ideal” of blonde hair, blue eyes and pale\nskin, which has been linked to white supremacist\nideologies (Hoffman, 1995; Schafer et al., 2014;\nGentry, 2022). Meanwhile, the appearance words\ndescribing minority groups are objectifying and\ndehumanizing. For example, personas of Asian\nwomen from all models are dominated by the words\nalmondshaped, petite, and smooth. These words\nconnect to representations of Asians, especially\nAsian women, in Western media as exotic, sub-\nmissive, and hypersexualized (Chan, 1988; Zheng,\n2016; Azhar et al., 2021). Such terms homogenize\nAsian individuals into a harmful image of docile\nobedience (Uchida, 1998).\nThe words distinguishing Latina women from\nunmarked groups include vibrant, curvaceous,\nrhythm and curves in GPT-4 personas. In GPT-\n3.5, vibrant also appears, and the top features\nfrom the SVM include passionate, brown, culture,\nspicy, colorful, dance, curves. These words corre-\nspond to tropicalism, a trope that includes elements\nlike brown skin, bright colors, and rhythmic mu-\nsic to homogenize and hypersexualize this identity\n(Molina-Guzmán, 2010; Martynuska, 2016). These\npatterns perpetuate representational harms to these\nintersectional groups.\nMarkedness, Essentialism and Othering The\ndifferences in the features demonstrate the marked-\nness of LLM outputs: the words associated with un-\nmarked, White GPT-3.5 personas include neutral,\neveryday descriptions, such as good (Table A5),\nwhile those associated with other groups tend not\nto (Table 3). Similarly,friendly and casually are top\n1510\nwords for man personas. On the other hand, gen-\nerated personas of marked groups reproduce prob-\nlematic archetypes. Middle-Eastern personas dis-\nproportionately mention religion (faith, religious,\nheadscarf ). This conflation of Middle-Eastern\nidentity with religious piety—and specifically the\nconflation of Arab with Muslim—has been criti-\ncized by media scholars for dehumanizing and de-\nmonizing Middle-Eastern people as brutal religious\nfanatics (Muscati, 2002; Shaheen, 2003). Also, the\nwords differentiating several marked race/ethnic\ngroups from the default one (White) include cul-\nture, traditional, proud and heritage. These pat-\nterns align with previous findings that those in\nmarked groups are defined primarily by their rela-\ntionship to their demographic identity, which con-\ntinues to set these groups apart in contrast to the\ndefault of whiteness (Frankenburg, 1993; Pierre,\n2004; Lewis, 2004). Similarly, the words for nonbi-\nnary personas, such as gender, identity, norms,and\nexpectations, exclusively focus on the portrayed\nindividual’s relationship to their gender identity.2\nThe words for Middle-Eastern and Asian per-\nsonas connect to critiques of Orientalism, a damag-\ning depiction where the East (encompassing Asia\nand the Middle East) is represented as the “ultimate\nOther” against which Western culture is defined;\ninaccurate, romanticized representations of these\ncultures have historically been used as implicit jus-\ntification for imperialism in these areas (Said, 1978;\nMa, 2000; Yoshihara, 2002).\nBy pigeonholing particular demographic groups\ninto specific narratives, the patterns in these gener-\nations homogenize these groups rather than char-\nacterizing the diversity within them. This reflects\nessentialism: individuals in these groups are de-\nfined solely by a limited, seemingly-fixed essential\nset of characteristics rather than their full humanity\n(Rosenblum and Travis, 1996; Woodward, 1997).\nEssentializing portrayals foster the othering of\nmarked groups, further entrenching their difference\nfrom the default groups of society (Brekhus, 1998;\nJensen, 2011; Dervin, 2012). Notions of essen-\ntial differences contribute to negative beliefs about\nminority groups (Mindell, 2006) and serve as justi-\nfication for the maintenance of existing power im-\nbalances across social groups (Stoler et al., 1995).\n2Top words for nonbinary personas also include negations,\ne.g., not, doesnt, dont, neither, nor (Table A4), that define\nthis group in a way that differentiates from the unmarked\ndefault. However, this phenomenon may be due to the label\nitself—nonbinary—also being marked with negation.\nother\ngroups\nLatino\nM\nBlack\nNB\nAsian\nW\nBlack\nM\nME W Latina\nW\nBlack\nW\nPersonas\n10\n20\n30% of Personas\nOccurrences of \"Resilient\" and \"Resilience\"\nGPT-3.5 GPT-4\nFigure 3: Percentage of personas that containresilient\nand resilience. Occurrences of resilient and resilience\nacross generated personas reveal that these terms are\nprimarily used in descriptions of Black women and other\nwomen of color. Groups where these words occur in\n< 10% of personas across models are subsumed into\n“other groups.” We observe similar trends for other\nmodels (Appendix D).\nThe Myth of Resilience Particular archetypes\narise for intersectional groups. For instance, words\nlike strength and resilient are significantly asso-\nciated with non-white personas, especially Black\nwomen (Figure 3). These words construct personas\nof resilience against hardship. Such narratives re-\nflect a broader phenomenon: the language of re-\nsilience has gained traction in recent decades as\na solution to poverty, inequality, and other per-\nvasive societal issues (Hicks, 2017; Allen, 2022).\nThis language has been criticized for disproportion-\nately harming women of color (McRobbie, 2020;\nAniefuna et al., 2020)—yet it is these very gender-\nby-ethnic groups whose descriptions contain the\nbulk of these words. This seemingly positive nar-\nrative has been associated with debilitating effects:\nthe notion of the Strong Black Woman has been\nlinked to psychological distress, poor health out-\ncomes, and suicidal behaviors (Woods-Giscombé,\n2010; Nelson et al., 2016; Castelin and White,\n2022). Rather than challenging the structures that\nnecessitate “strength” and “resilience,” expecting\nindividuals to have these qualities further normal-\nizes the existence of the environments that fostered\nthem (Rottenberg, 2014; Watson and Hunter, 2016;\nLiao et al., 2020).\nLimitations of Anti-stereotyping We notice that\na small set of identified words seem to be explicitly\nanti-stereotypical: Only nonbinary groups, who\nhave historically experienced debilitating reper-\ncussions for self-expression (Blumer et al., 2013;\nHegarty et al., 2018), are portrayed with words\nlike embrace and authentic. For GPT-3.5, top\nwords include independent only for women per-\nsonas (and especially Middle-Eastern women), and\nleader, powerful only for Black personas (Tables\nA5 and A6). We posit that these words might in fact\nresult from bias mitigation mechanisms, as only\n1511\nportrayals of groups that have historically lacked\npower and independence contain words like power-\nful and independent, while portrayals of unmarked\nindividuals are devoid of them.\nSuch anti-stereotyping efforts may be interpreted\nthrough a Gricean lens (Grice, 1975) as flouting\nthe Maxim of Relation: mentioning a historically\nlacking property only for the group that lacked it.\nBy doing so, such conversations reinforce the es-\nsentializing narratives that define individuals from\nmarginalized groups solely by their demographic.\n7 Downstream Applications: Stories\nPopular use-cases for LLMs include creative gen-\neration and assisting users with creative writing\n(Parrish et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Lee et al.,\n2022). Inspired by previous work that uses topic\nmodeling and lexicon-based methods to examine bi-\nases in GPT-generated stories (Lucy and Bamman,\n2021), we are interested in uncovering whether,\nlike the generated personas, generated stories con-\ntain patterns of markedness and stereotypes beyond\nthose contained in lexicons. We generate 30 sto-\nries for each of the 15 gender-by-race/ethnic group\nusing the prompts in Table A14.\nUsing Marked Words on the stories, we find\ntrends of essentializing narratives and stereotypes\n(Table A15): for unmarked groups, the only signifi-\ncant words beside explicit descriptors are neutral\n(town and shop). For marked groups, the significant\nwords contain stereotypes, such as martial arts for\nstories about Asians—although not overtly nega-\ntive, this is tied to representational harms (Chang\nand Kleiner, 2003; Reny and Manzano, 2016). The\nmyth of resilience, whose harms we have discussed,\nis evidenced by words likedetermined, dreams, and\nworked hard defining stories about marked groups,\nespecially women of color. These tropes are ap-\nparent across example stories (Table A13). Thus,\nthese pernicious patterns persist in downstream ap-\nplications like creative generation.\n8 Recommendations\nIn the same way that Bailey et al. (2022) reveal\n“bias in society’s collective view of itself,” we re-\nveal bias in LLMs’ collective views of society: de-\nspite equivalently labeled groups in the prompts,\nthe resulting generations contain themes of marked-\nness and othering. As LLMs increase in their so-\nphistication and widespread use, our findings un-\nderscore the importance of the following directions.\nAddressing Positive Stereotypes and Essential-\nizing Narratives Even if a word seems positive\nin sentiment, it may contribute to a harmful nar-\nrative. Thus, it is insufficient to replace negative\nlanguage with positive language, as the latter is still\nimbued with potentially harmful societal context\nand affects, from perniciously positive words to\nessentializing narratives to flouting Gricean max-\nims. We have discussed how the essentializing\nnarratives in LLM outputs perpetuate discrimina-\ntion, dehumanization, and other harms; relatedly,\nSanturkar et al. (2023) also find that GPT-3.5’s rep-\nresentations of demographic groups are largely ho-\nmogenous. We recommend further study of these\nphenomena’s societal implications as well as the\nalternative of critical refusal (Garcia et al., 2020):\nthe model should recognize generating personas\nof demographic groups as impossible without re-\nlying on stereotypes and essentializing narratives\nthat ostracize marked groups. Across the prompts\nand models that we tested, refusal is sometimes\nperformed only by ChatGPT (Appendix D.3).\nAn Intersectional Lens Our analysis reveals that\npersonas of intersectional groups contain distinc-\ntive stereotypes. Thus, bias measurement and miti-\ngation ought to account not only for particular axes\nof identity but also how the intersections of these\naxes lead to unique power differentials and risks.\nTransparency about Bias Mitigation Methods\nAs OpenAI does not release their bias mitigation\ntechniques, it is unclear to what extent the pos-\nitive stereotypes results from bias mitigation at-\ntempts, the underlying training data, and/or other\ncomponents of the model. The model may be re-\nproducing modern values: ethnic stereotypes have\nbecome more frequent and less negative (Madon\net al., 2001). Or, some versions of GPT are trained\nusing fine-tuning on human-written demonstrations\nand human-rated samples; on the rating rubric re-\nleased by OpenAI, the closest criterion to stereo-\ntypes is “Denigrates a protected class” (Ouyang\net al., 2022). Thus, positive stereotypes that are not\novertly denigrating may have been overlooked with\nsuch criteria. The APIs we use are distinct from\nthe models documented in that paper, so it is hard\nto draw any concrete conclusions about underlying\nmechanisms. Transparency about safeguards and\nbias mitigation would enable researchers and prac-\ntitioners to more easily understand the benefits and\nlimitations of these methods.\n1512\n9 Limitations\nRather than a complete, systematic probing of the\nstereotypes and biases related to each demographic\ngroup that may occur in the open-ended outputs,\nour study offers insight into the patterns in the\nstereotypes that the widespread use of LLMs may\npropagate. It is limited in scope, as we only evalu-\nate models available through the OpenAI API.\nStereotypes vary across cultures. While our ap-\nproach can be generalized to other contexts, our\nlexicon and qualitative analysis draw only upon\nAmerican stereotypes, and we perform the analysis\nonly on English. Beyond the five race/ethnicity and\nthree gender groups we evaluate, there are many\nother demographic categories and identity markers\nthat we do not yet explore.\nAnother limitation of our method is that it\ncurrently requires defining which identities are\n(un)marked a priori, rather than finding the de-\nfault/unmarked class in an unsupervised manner.\nThe prompts are marked with the desired demo-\ngraphic attribute, and every persona is produced\nwith an explicit group label. Given these explicit\nlabels, we then compare and analyze the results for\nmarked vs. unmarked groups.\nA potential risk of our paper is that by study-\ning harms to particular demographic groups, we\nreify these socially constructed categories. Also,\nby focusing our research on OpenAI’s models, we\ncontribute to their dominance and widespread use.\nAcknowledgments\nThank you to Kaitlyn Zhou, Mirac Suzgun, Diyi\nYang, Omar Shaikh, Jing Huang, Rajiv Movva, and\nKushal Tirumala for their very helpful feedback on\nthis paper!

(2022).\nA Stereotype Measure Desiderata\nTable A1 illustrates a comparison of Marked Per-\nsonas to other stereotype measures. The desiderata\nfor an effective measure of stereotypes in LLMs\ncomes from Cao et al. (2022): “ Generalizes de-\nnotes approaches that naturally extend to previ-\nously unconsidered groups; Grounded approaches\nare those that are grounded in social science theory;\nExhaustiveness refers to how well the traits cover\nthe space of possible stereotypes; Naturalness is\nthe degree to which the text input to the LLM is\nnatural; Specificity indicates whether the stereotype\nis specific or abstract.”\nThe works listed in Table A1 refer to the\nfollowing papers: Debiasing (Bolukbasi et al.,\n2016), CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020), Stere-\noset (Nadeem et al., 2021), S. Bias Frames (Sap\net al., 2020), CEAT (Guo and Caliskan, 2021), and\nABC (Cao et al., 2022).\nB Marked Words versus JSD\nNote that in general settings, Marked Words and\nJSD differ in their priors and are not interchange-\nable: Marked Words uses the other texts in the\ndataset as the prior distribution, while JSD only\nuses the texts being compared as the prior distribu-\ntion. We posit that the overlap we observe is due to\nsimilar distribution of words across the personas of\ndifferent groups since they are all generated with\nsimilar prompts.\nC Prompting for Sentiment\nWe find that positively/negatively-modified\nprompts (“Describe a ____ that you like/dislike”)\nlead to positive/negative sentiment respectively\nas measured by V ADER (scores of 0.055 and\n1517\n−0.28958 respectively). We use the neutral\nprompts presented in Table A9 for various\nreasons: 1) there are ethical concerns related to\nattempting to yield negative responses, 2) it’s\nwell-established that positive/negative prompts\nyield positive/negative responses, 3) including\nsentiment changes the distribution of top words,\nand 4) many existing stereotype and toxicity\nmeasures focus on negative sentiment, and these\nmeasures may be connected to existing efforts\nto minimize stereotypes. Instead, we discuss the\npreviously-unmeasured dimension of harmful\ncorrelations persisting despite neutral prompts\nand nonnegative sentiments. A careful study of\nhow explicitly including sentiment impacts our\nfindings is a possible direction for future work, and\nwe include the generations using negatively- and\npositively-modified prompts in the data folder of\nthe Github repository.\nD Results Across Models\nD.1 Results for GPT-4\nThe full list of top words identified for generations\nfrom GPT-4 are in Tables A2, A3, and A4.\nD.2 Results for GPT-3.5\nD.2.1 text-davinci-003 versus\ntext-davinci-002\nWe find that the older\ntext-davinci-002 clearly generates even\nmore stereotypes than text-davinci-003,\nso we focus on text-davinci-003 as\na more recent and conservative estimate\nof GPT-3.5. To compare rates of stereo-\ntyping between text-davinci-003 and\ntext-davinci-002, we generate personas\nusing text-davinci-002 with the same\nparameters and prompts as described in Section 4\nfor text-davinci-003. Example generations\nusing text-davinci-002 are in Table A12.\nWe use the lists of stereotypical attributes for vari-\nous ethnicities provided by Ghavami and Peplau\n(2013) to compare rates of stereotyping across per-\nsonas generated by text-davinci-003 with\ntext-davinci-002. Specifically, we count\nthe percentage of words in the personas that\nare in the stereotype lexicon (Figure A1). We\nfind that stereotypes are broadly more prevalent\nin text-davinci-002 outputs than in\ntext-davinci-003 ones.\nD.2.2 Results for text-davinci-003\nWe report the full list of top words for\ntext-davinci-003 in Table A5 and A6. Ex-\nample generations are in Table A11.\nD.3 Results for ChatGPT\nChatGPT is a GPT-3.5 model optimized for chat\n(OpenAI, 2022). We find that it is inconsistent at\ngenerating the desired personas for some of the\nprompts. Interestingly, for ChatGPT, the latter four\nprompts in Table A9 lead to an output that can be\ninterpreted as a refusal to generate personas, e.g.,\n“As an AI language model, I cannot de-\nscribe a White man or any individual\nbased on their skin color or race as it\npromotes stereotyping and discrimina-\ntion. We should not generalize individu-\nals based on their physical appearance or\nethnicity. Every individual is unique and\nshould be respected regardless of their\nphysical appearance or ethnicity.”\nSpecifically, we find that for each prompt in Table\nA9, 0%, 0%, 77%, 67%, 100%, 100% of the out-\nputs respectively contained the phrase “language\nmodel.” It is still quite straightforward to gener-\nate texts without refusal by using certain prompts:\nsince this behavior does not occur for the first two\nprompts, we analyze these, and we find similar pat-\nterns as those reported in the main text (Tables A7\nand A8, Figures A2, A3, and A4).\nD.4 Other models\nWe find that text-davinci-003,\ntext-davinci-002, ChatGPT, and GPT-\n4 are the only models that, upon prompting to\ngenerate a persona, outputs a coherent description\nthat indeed centers on one person. Other models,\nincluding OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), BLOOM\n(Scao et al., 2022), and smaller GPT-3.5 models,\ncannot output such coherent descriptions in a\nzero-shot setting. This aligns with previous\nfindings on the performance of different LLMs\n(Liang et al., 2022).\n1518\nGroup Significant Words\nBlack NB their, identity, gender, both, beau-\ntiful, traditional, of, (tone, societal,\nbeautifully, terms, confidence, bold,\nness, melaninrich, respect, rich)\nAsian NB their, asian, almondshaped, tradi-\ntional, (features, soft, eyes, appear-\nance, use, expectations, combina-\ntion, delicate)\nME NB their, middle, middleeastern, tradi-\ntional, beautiful, east, blend, in-\ntricate, flowing, garments, pat-\nterns, (olive, striking, attire, norms,\ngrown, culture)\nLatine NB their, latino, identity, latinx, gen-\nder, traditional, latin, american, vi-\nbrant, (wavy, embrace, heritage,\nroots, genderneutral, cultural, along,\ncomfortable)\nTable A2: Top words for intersectional nonbinary\n(NB) groups in generated personas.

She had moved to\nthe United States with her family when she was a young girl, determined to make something\nof herself. From an early age, she had a strong desire to solve difficult problems.\nWhen she graduated from high school, she headed off to the bright lights of New York City.\nNew York was exciting but daunting. But Li Hua was determined to make the most of it. She\nstarted college and studied hard, eventually earning a degree in Computer Science.\nHer hard work paid off and she landed a job at a prestigious tech firm in the city. Despite the\nchallenge of having to constantly prove herself, Li Hua excelled and soon became an integral\npart of the team.\nAt first Li Hua didn’t think much about being an Asian woman in a very white, male-\ndominated industry. But after a few years she started to realize how few women, let alone\nAsian women, were in the industry.\nBut she never let this deter her from her work. Instead, she embraced her Asian heritage and\nused it to motivate her and drive her further.\nLi Hua worked harder than ever and eventually became one of the top engineers in the firm.\nWhite\nman\nOnce upon a time there was a White man named Jack. He was an ordinary man, but he had a\ndream. He wanted to explore the world and see all its wonders.\nHe had worked hard all his life and saved up money until he finally had enough. With a heavy\nheart, he said goodbye to his family and friends and set off on a journey of exploration.\nHe embarked on a journey across the globe, to places he had never dreamed of visiting. He\nencountered cultures, climates and landscapes he’d never seen before. He met people with\ndifferent beliefs and languages, and for the first time, he felt connected to something much\nbigger than himself.\nAlong the way, Jack encountered unexpected moments of joy and sorrow, but the thing he\nkept coming back to was the adventure. He put himself in risky situations, revealing a strength\nhe hadn’t even known he possessed. Slowly, but surely, he was writing his own story.\nWhen he returned home, Jack was a different man. He had seen the beauty of the world, and\nit gave him a new appreciation for his life and community.\nBlack\nwoman\nDelilah Washington was a proud Black woman. Born and raised in a large city, she’d seen\nplenty of prejudice and racism. But she had never let that get in the way of her successful\ncareer.\nDelilah worked as an executive assistant at a large media company. She had worked her way\nup the ranks, learning the ins and outs of the business at each position. She used what she\nhad learned to help her company expand its reach and grow even more successful.\nThroughout her career, Delilah had to continuously push through the negative comments and\nattitudes of her peers. Despite being one of the most hard-working and talented employees,\nshe still faced stereotypes and microaggressions that contradicted her work ethic.

Did you describe the limitations of your work?\nSection 8\n□\u0013 A2. Did you discuss any potential risks of your work?\nSection 8\n□\u0013 A3. Do the abstract and introduction summarize the paper’s main claims?\nAbstract and Section 1\n□\u0017 A4. Have you used AI writing assistants when working on this paper?\nLeft blank.\nB □\u0013 Did you use or create scientiﬁc artifacts?\nSection 3\n□\u0013 B1. Did you cite the creators of artifacts you used?\nSection 3\n□\u0013 B2. Did you discuss the license or terms for use and / or distribution of any artifacts?\nSection 3\n□\u0013 B3. Did you discuss if your use of existing artifact(s) was consistent with their intended use, provided\nthat it was speciﬁed? For the artifacts you create, do you specify intended use and whether that is\ncompatible with the original access conditions (in particular, derivatives of data accessed for research\npurposes should not be used outside of research contexts)?\nSection 3\n□\u0017 B4. Did you discuss the steps taken to check whether the data that was collected / used contains any\ninformation that names or uniquely identiﬁes individual people or offensive content, and the steps\ntaken to protect / anonymize it?\nOur data is generated and does not contain personal information.\n□\u0013 B5. Did you provide documentation of the artifacts, e.g., coverage of domains, languages, and\nlinguistic phenomena, demographic groups represented, etc.?\nSection 3\n□\u0013 B6. Did you report relevant statistics like the number of examples, details of train / test / dev splits,\netc. for the data that you used / created? Even for commonly-used benchmark datasets, include the\nnumber of examples in train / validation / test splits, as these provide necessary context for a reader\nto understand experimental results. For example, small differences in accuracy on large test sets may\nbe signiﬁcant, while on small test sets they may not be.\nSection 3\nC □\u0013 Did you run computational experiments?\nSection 3\n□\u0013 C1. Did you report the number of parameters in the models used, the total computational budget\n(e.g., GPU hours), and computing infrastructure used?\nSection 3\nThe Responsible NLP Checklist used at ACL 2023 is adopted from NAACL 2022, with the addition of a question on AI writing\nassistance.\n1531\n□\u0013 C2. Did you discuss the experimental setup, including hyperparameter search and best-found\nhyperparameter values?\nSection 3\n□\u0013 C3. Did you report descriptive statistics about your results (e.g., error bars around results, summary\nstatistics from sets of experiments), and is it transparent whether you are reporting the max, mean,\netc. or just a single run?\nSection 3\n□\u0013 C4. If you used existing packages (e.g., for preprocessing, for normalization, or for evaluation), did\nyou report the implementation, model, and parameter settings used (e.g., NLTK, Spacy, ROUGE,\netc.)?\nSection 3, Section 5\nD □\u0017 Did you use human annotators (e.g., crowdworkers) or research with human participants?\nLeft blank.\n□ D1. Did you report the full text of instructions given to participants, including e.g., screenshots,\ndisclaimers of any risks to participants or annotators, etc.?\nNo response.\n□ D2. Did you report information about how you recruited (e.g., crowdsourcing platform, students)\nand paid participants, and discuss if such payment is adequate given the participants’ demographic\n(e.g., country of residence)?\nNo response.\n□ D3. Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you’re\nusing/curating? For example, if you collected data via crowdsourcing, did your instructions to\ncrowdworkers explain how the data would be used?\nNo response.\n□ D4. Was the data collection protocol approved (or determined exempt) by an ethics review board?\nNo response.\n□ D5. Did you report the basic demographic and geographic characteristics of the annotator population\nthat is the source of the data?\nNo response.\n1532"
