    "abstract": "This paper presents a method to obtain an electric model for transformers and inductors, including both frequency and geometry effects in the windings, which can be linked with existing core models. One-dimensional distributions for magnetic and electric fields are assumed, and from Maxwell's equations an equivalent electric circuit is easily obtained. This equivalent circuit has been included in analog simulators (Spice, AnalogWorkBench, Saber ...), and comparisons between measured and simulated results are shown, both in time domain and in AC sweep, which verify the model accuracy. The model described in this paper allows designers to deal with key issues in the design of high-frequency magnetic components (copper losses, leakage inductance, skin and proximity effects) by using analog simulators, which are usually more familiar to them than finite-element analysis tools.",
