  "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and language models such as ChatGPT-4 (Generative Pretrained Transformer) have made tremendous advances recently and are rapidly transforming the landscape of medicine. Cardiology is among many of the specialties that utilize AI with the intention of improving patient care. Generative AI, with the use of its advanced machine learning algorithms, has the potential to diagnose heart disease and recommend management options suitable for the patient. This may lead to improved patient outcomes not only by recommending the best treatment plan but also by increasing physician efficiency. Language models could assist physicians with administrative tasks, allowing them to spend more time on patient care. However, there are several concerns with the use of AI and language models in the field of medicine. These technologies may not be the most up-to-date with the latest research and could provide outdated information, which may lead to an adverse event. Secondly, AI tools can be expensive, leading to increased healthcare costs and reduced accessibility to the general population. There is also concern about the loss of the human touch and empathy as AI becomes more mainstream. Healthcare professionals would need to be adequately trained to utilize these tools. While AI and language models have many beneficial traits, all healthcare providers need to be involved and aware of generative AI so as to assure its optimal use and mitigate any potential risks and challenges associated with its implementation. In this review, we discuss the various uses of language models in the field of cardiology.",
