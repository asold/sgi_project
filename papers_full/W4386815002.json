It aims to provide a thorough \nunderstanding of the environmental implications \nassociated with the entire lifecycle of a product, \nincluding the extraction of raw materials, \nproduction, use, and disposal (Buyle, Braet and \nAudenaert, 2013). The rigorous methodology of LCA \nensures that all relevant environmental impacts are \nVolume 2 – Digital Design Reconsidered – eCAADe 41 | 39\nconsidered, providing a holistic and reliable \nassessment of the enviro nmental footprint of a \nproduct or system. \nLCA is applicable across a wide range of \nindustries and sectors, including manufacturing, \nconstruction, transportation, and consumer goods \n(Hellweg, Mila and Canals, 2014). It provides valuable \ninsights for designers, policymakers, and businesses \nto make informed decisions about the \nenvironmental impact of  their products and \nprocesses (Zhang et al., 2020). LCA can inform the \ndevelopment of new products, help improve \nexisting products and processes, and support the \nimplementation of sustainable practices. It is used to \nevaluate the trade-offs between different materials, \ntechnologies, and design alternatives, as well as to \ncompare and evaluate the environmental \nperformance of competing products (Bishop, Styles \nand Lens, 2021). In recent years, LCA has become \nincreasingly important for companies to \ndemonstrate their commitment to sustainability and \nmeet the growing demand for environmentally-\nfriendly products from consumers (Roos et al., 2016).  \nIn the field of architectural design and \nconstruction, LCA provides a framework to consider \nthe environmental impact of buildings and \ninfrastructure over their entire life cycle (Evangelista \net al., 2018). It enables architects, engineers, and \nconstruction professionals to make informed \ndecisions about materials selection, construction \nmethods, and building operations that minimize \nenvironmental impact (Bas bagill et al. 2013). The \nbenefits of LCA in architectural design and \nconstruction are numerous. It can inform the \nselection of materials that are not only aesthetically \npleasing but also environmentally responsible \n(Pollini and Rognoli, 2021). It can also help to \noptimize building operations, such as energy and \nwater usage, to minimize environmental impact \n(Zabalza et al., 2013). Additionally, LCA can help \nidentify opportunities for waste reduction, recycling, \nand other sustainability initiatives (Maria, Eyckmans \nand Acker, 2020). \nThe implications of LCA in architectural design and \nconstruction have the pote ntial to drive innovation \nin sustainable building practices and materials, \nsupport the transition to a low-carbon built \nenvironment, and promote environmentally \nresponsible design. LCA can also help to educate \ndesign and construction professionals about the \nenvironmental impact of their decisions and raise \nawareness about the role of the built environment in \naddressing global sustainabi lity challenges (Malkki \nand Alanne, 2017). By integrating LCA into the \ndesign process, designers and builders can \ncontribute to a more sustainable future by creating \nbuildings and infrastructure that are \nenvironmentally responsible , economically viable, \nand socially responsible. There are several \ntechnologies and tools associated with LCA that \nsupport the collection and analysis of data and help \nmake the LCA process more efficient and accessible. \nLife Cycle Inventory (LCI) databases such as \nEcoinvent and the GaBi databases provide pre-\nexisting information about the environmental \nimpact of various materials, products, and processes, \nallowing for a faster and more accurate assessment \nof a product's life cycle (Pauer, Wohner and Tacker, \n2020). Software such as SimaPro and GaBi, \nautomates the LCA process, allowing users to \nperform assessments with a high degree of accuracy \nand consistency (Herrmann and Moltesen, 2015). \nEnvironmental Product Declarations (EPDs) provide \na standardized and independently verified report on \nthe environmental impact of a product, allowing for \nthe comparison of products across different \ncategories (Rasmussen et al., 2021). Carbon footprint \ncalculators allow users to calculate the carbon \nemissions associated with a product or process and \ncan be used as a simplified form of LCA (Zhong et al., \n2019). These technologies and tools make it easier \nfor designers, builders, and manufacturers to \nunderstand and reduce the environmental impact of \ntheir products and processes and support the \ntransition to a more sustainable future. \nOn top of these technologies, recently released \nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to \n40 | eCAADe 41 – Volume 2 – Digital Design Reconsidered\nrevolutionize various industries, including the field \nof LCA. LLMs can be integrated with LCA to enhance \nthe accuracy and speed of the assessment process, \nas well as to provide a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of the environmental impact of \nbuilding materials, processes, and products. LLMs \ncan automate the data collection and analysis \nprocess by extracting and analyzing data from a \nvariety of sources, includ ing product specifications, \nproduct databases, and scie ntific articles (Trummer, \n2022). They can provide insights into product \nsustainability by analyzin g product specifications \nand assessing the environmental impact of different \nmaterials, products, and processes, allowing \ndesigners, builders, and manufacturers to make \ninformed decisions about product selection. LLMs \ncan support the development of new materials and \nproducts by analyzing pr oduct specifications and \nsuggesting alternative materials and products that \nhave a lower environmental impact. LLMs can \nstreamline the communication of LCA results by \ngenerating reports and summaries of LCA results, \nmaking the results more accessible and \nunderstandable to a wider audience. Overall, the \nintegration of LLMs with LCA has the potential to \ntransform the way that the environmental impact of \nbuilding materials, processes, and products is \nassessed, enabling more informed and sustainable \ndecision-making in the fiel d of architectural design \nand construction. \nLARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs) \nThe LLMs are neural network architectures, typically \nutilizing variants of recurrent neural networks such \nas the transformer, which are trained on large \ncorpora of textual data using techniques such as \nunsupervised pre-training and fine-tuning (Veres, \n2022). These models learn to generate text by \npredicting the next word in a sequence based on the \ncontextual information provided by the previous \nwords and are able to prod uce coherent and fluent \nsentences that resemble human-written text (Aliyu \nand Kotzee, 2022) with po tential applications in \narchitectural design and construction and related  \n \ndesign fields. The architecture of large language \nmodels (LLMs) typically consists of several layers of \nneural networks (Arnold, Paugam-Moisy and Sebag, \n2010). These layers may include attention \nmechanisms, transformer blocks, or other \nspecialized modules depending on the specific \nmodel (Bahdanau, Cho and Bengio, 2014).  \nOne key aspect of LLM architecture is the use of self-\nattention mechanisms, which allow the model to \nattend to different parts of the input text when \nmaking predictions enabli ng the model to capture \ncomplex dependencies between words and phrases, \nwhich is particularly useful for tasks like language \nmodeling and machine translation (Skrlj et al., 2021). \nAnother important component of LLM architecture \nis the use of pre-training, where the model is first \ntrained on a large corpus of text using unsupervised \nlearning techniques enabling the model to learn a \nrich representation of the underlying structure of \nlanguage, which can then be fine-tuned on specific \ndownstream tasks (Zhang et al., 2020). \nOverall, the architecture of LLMs is designed to \nenable the model to learn high-level representations \nof language that can be used for a wide range of \nFigure 1 \nThe architecture of \nGenerative Pre-\ntrained Transformer \n3 (GPT-3) \nVolume 2 – Digital Design Reconsidered – eCAADe 41 | 41\nnatural language processing (NLP) tasks, from simple \ntext classification to more complex tasks like \nquestion answering and text generation. LLMs can \ndo a variety of tasks beyond just predicting the next \nword in a sequence when combined with different \nmethods and tools. The capabilities of LLMs and their \narea of use include language understanding, text-to-\ntext translation, text-to-image generation, text \ncompletion, reinforcement learning etc. (Zhou et al., \n2021).  \nIn order to have a better understanding of the \nprocess, the architecture of Generative Pre-trained \nTransformer 3 (GPT-3) was investigated (Figure 1). It \nis a deep neural network (DNN) that consists of \nmultiple transformer blocks, which are a type of \nneural network module specifically designed for NLP \ntasks (Gillioz et al., 2020). At a high level, GPT-3 takes \nas input a sequence of text, such as a sentence or \nparagraph, and processes it through a series of \ntransformer blocks to generate a corresponding \nsequence of output text.  \nIn Figure 1, the blue components represent the \ninput text and the related encodings. The input text \nis tokenized (i.e., split into individual words or \ntokens) and then passed through various encoding \nlayers to convert it into a numerical representation \nthat the model can work with. These layers typically \ninclude a token embedding layer that maps each \ntoken to a vector representation and a positional \nencoding layer that adds information about the \nposition of each token in the input sequence. The \ngreen components represent the layers of the \ntransformer model that comprise the bulk of the \nGPT-3 architecture. These layers include multiple \nlevels of self-attention (or multi-head attention) and \nfeed-forward networks, wh ich enable the model to \ncapture complex patterns in the input text and \ngenerate high-quality output. The green \ncomponents also include residual connections and \nnormalization layers, which help to prevent \nvanishing gradients and stabilize the training \nprocess. The orange components represent the \ndropout layers used for re gularization. Dropout is a \ntechnique used to prevent overfitting in deep \nlearning models by randomly \"dropping out\" some \nof the neurons in a layer during training. This helps \nto prevent the model from becoming too reliant on \nany one feature and can improve its generalization \nperformance on new data. The purple component \nrepresents the output text generated by the model. \nThis is the final result produced by the GPT-3 \narchitecture, which is based on the input text and \nthe context provided to the model. \nSome of the components that have been \nidentified as particularly important for the \nperformance of the LLMs include the self-attention \nmechanism, the use of pre-training on large \ndatasets, and the size and depth of the model \narchitecture. Additionally, the quality and quantity \nof the training data used to train the model can also \nbe a critical factor in the performance of the model. \nThe recently released ChatGPT, developed by \nOpenAI, is an implementation of the GPT \narchitecture specifically designed for the tasks of \ngenerating natural language texts (Mijwil, Aljanabi \nand Ali, 2023). The architecture consists of multiple \nlayers of self-attention and feed-forward neural \nnetworks, similar to the original GPT architecture. \nIn the ChatGPT, the components mentioned \nearlier are crucial in the sense that they allow the \nmodel to process and understand the input text and \ngenerate coherent and contextually relevant \nresponses. The token embedding layer is responsible \nfor converting each word in the input text into a \nnumerical representation. The positional encoding \nlayer helps the model to understand the position of \neach word in the input text, which is important for \nmaintaining the context. The multi-head self-\nattention layer allows the model to attend to \ndifferent parts of the input text and gather \ninformation from them. The residual connection and \nnormalization layers improve the flow of information \nthrough the layers and prevent the model from \nlosing information. The po sition-wise feed-forward \nlayer processes the information further and adds \nadditional context. Finally, the dropout layer is used \nfor regularization, which helps prevent the \noverfitting of the model. Overall, these components \n42 | eCAADe 41 – Volume 2 – Digital Design Reconsidered\nwork together to allow the ChatGPT to understand \nand generate natural language text, making it a \npowerful tool for various natural language \nprocessing tasks such as chatbot development and \nlanguage translation. \nAs an open-source language model, ChatGPT's \narchitecture and pre-trained models are publicly \navailable for developers to build upon for specific \napplications. The pre-trained models can be fine-\ntuned on a specific dataset to specialize the model \nfor a specific task, such as sentiment analysis or \nchatbot development. This allows for the \ndevelopment of highly customized language \nmodels that can perform specific tasks at a high level \nof accuracy. \nIn addition to the pre-trained models, ChatGPT \nprovides an API that can be used for integrating the \nlanguage model into specif ic tools or applications. \nThe API allows for easy integration of ChatGPT's \nnatural language proce ssing capabilities into \nexisting software, such as chatbots or virtual \nassistants. Furthermore, ChatGPT can be integrated \nwith a wide variety of open-source tools, libraries, \nand frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, \nwhich makes it easy for developers to incorporate \nChatGPT into their existing workflows. This flexibility \nallows for a wide range of use cases and enables \nd e v e l o p e r s  t o  c r e a t e  h i g h l y  c u s t o m i z e d  l a n g u a g e  \nmodels that meet specific  requirements. There are \nmany software and tools that have been built on top \nof the ChatGPT architecture. Some examples include \nCopy.ai, a web application that generates marketing \ncopy, taglines, and slogan s using GPT-3 language \nmodels; Jarvis, a mobile application that uses GPT-3 \nto generate natural language responses to user \nqueries; Hugging Face, a platform that provides a \nsuite of natural language processing tools, including \ntransformers and language models, that can be used \nfor a wide range of applications; AI Dungeon: a web-\nbased game that uses GPT-3 to generate interactive \nstories and game scenarios based on user input; \nGPT-3 Sandbox, a web-based playground that allows \ndevelopers to experiment with GPT-3 models and \nbuild their own applications. These are just a few \nexamples of the many applications and tools that \nhave been built using the ChatGPT architecture. \nWith the open-source nature of the platform and the \navailability of APIs, there is virtually no limit to the \nkinds of tools and applications that can be built on \ntop of this technology. The first step is to tokenize \nthe input text, breaking it down into a series of \nindividual tokens or words. These tokens are then \npassed through a layer of positional embeddings, \nwhich encode the position of each token in the \nsequence. The token embeddings are then \nprocessed through a series of encoder and decoder \nlayers, each consisting of multiple transformer \nblocks. The encoder layers analyze the input text and \ngenerate a series of hidden representations that \ncapture the meaning and context of each word or \nphrase, while the decoder layers use these \nrepresentations to generate the corresponding \noutput text. The final output of GPT-3 is a sequence \nof tokens corresponding to the generated text. This \narchitecture enables GPT-3 to generate high-quality \ntext that is fluent and coherent and can be used for \na wide range of NLP tasks. \nLEVERAGING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT \n(LCA) THROUGH LLMs \nThe architecture of ChatGPT, namely GPT-3, has the \npotential to be used as a “text-to-LCA” bot in \nevaluating materials' sustainability. One possible \napplication is through anal yzing the language used \nin materials' specifications and comparing it against \nestablished sustainability standards. For example, \nGPT-3 could be used to identify the use of materials \nthat are known to be unsustainable, such as those \nwith high carbon footprints or that are non-\nrenewable. GPT-3 could also be used to assess the \nsustainability of a given design or construction \nproject by analyzing text descriptions of the project's \nmaterials, energy usage, and other factors. The \nmodel could be trained to recognize patterns and \nassociations that are indi cative of environmentally \nfriendly design and construction practices, such as \nthe use of renewable energy  sources or low-impact \nbuilding materials. Another potential use of GPT-3 in \nVolume 2 – Digital Design Reconsidered – eCAADe 41 | 43\nevaluating materials' sustainability is through \nanalyzing text descriptions of materials themselves, \nsuch as their composition, production processes, \nand expected lifespan. By analyzing this information, \nthe model could identify mate rials that are likely to \nbe more sustainable or environmentally friendly, \nsuch as those that are recyclable or biodegradable. \nOverall, GPT-3's ability to analyze and understand \nnatural language could be harnessed to support \nefforts in evaluating materials' sustainability, as well \nas in other areas of sustainable design and \nconstruction. \nConventional construction materials, such as \nconcrete, steel, and wood, are widely used in the \nbuilding industry. However, producing these \nmaterials can have significant environmental \nimpacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, water, \nand air pollution, and th e depletion of natural \nresources. Their LCA studies have been widely \nconducted, and these environmental challenges \nhave been reported. These LCA studies have \nprovided valuable insights into the environmental \nimpact of conventional construction materials, and \nhave supported the development of more \nsustainable building materials and construction \npractices. The results of these studies have also been \nused to develop sustainability standards, such as the \nISO 14040 series for Life Cycle Assessment, which \nprovides guidelines for conducting LCA studies and \ncomparing the sustainability of different materials \nand products. \nOn top these materials, biologically active \nmaterials are a relatively novel class of biobased \nmaterials that have recently gained attention for \ntheir potential applications in building construction. \nThese materials incorporate living microorganisms, \nsuch as bacteria, fungi, and algae, into building \nmaterials to enhance their functional properties and \ncreate new opportunities for sustainable design. \nExamples of biologically active biobased materials \ninclude bio-concrete, a type of concrete that \nincorporates bacteria into the mixture, which \nproduces calcium carbonat e in the presence of \nwater. This process helps to heal cracks and extend \nthe life of the concrete, reducing the need for repairs \nand maintenance; algae-based building materials \nthat incorporate living algae into building materials, \nsuch as insulation and wall panels, to provide \ninsulation and improved air quality; mycelium-based \nmaterials that are made from the fast-growing \nunderground network of fungal filaments known as \nmycelium. These materials have high insulation and \nthermal performance, and can be used as an \nalternative to conventional insulation materials. \nIn contrast to various databases for conventional \nbuilding construction materials, these biologically \nactive materials as construction materials do not \nhave any databases. The reason is that these \nmaterials have emerged with the application of \ndifferent material formulations, and the production \nis often altered based on the desired qualities, such \nas increasing the tensile strength or coloring. This \nstudy aims to leverage the LCA of biobased materials \nthrough LLMs, focusing on evaluating a bacterial \ncellulose-based (BC-based) partition wall as a case \nstudy. Since the traditional LCA processes can be \ntime-consuming and resource-intensive, especially \nwhen dealing with complex and living materials w,th \nintricate processes such as the growth and \nproduction of bacterial cellulose (BC). LLMs, on the \nother hand, have shown promising results in \nstreamlining and automating various tasks, \nincluding data gathering and analysis. \nMETHODOLOGY \nThis methodology (Figure 2) aims to integrate the \ncapabilities of LLMs into the LCA process, to enhance \nits efficiency and accuracy. The methodology is \ndivided into five main stages: Defining the functional \nunit; identifying the life cycle stages; collecting \nenvironmental and social impact data; interpreting \nand evaluating; building a web-based tool.  \nStage 1: Defining the Functional Unit.  The first \nstage of the methodology involves defining the \nfunctional unit, which is the unit of product or \nprocess that will be evaluated in the LCA. In this case, \nthe functional unit is defined as a 1x2 square meter \nof BC-based partition wall surface.  \n44 | eCAADe 41 – Volume 2 – Digital Design Reconsidered\nStage 2: Identifying the Life Cycle Stages.  The \nsecond stage of the methodology involves \nidentifying the life cycle st ages of the partition wall. \nThe life cycle stages are divided into the following \nphases based on the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044: Raw \nmaterial production and processing, manufacture of \nthe partition wall, transportation and distribution, \ninstallation and use of the partition wall, disposal or \nend of life. \nStage 3: Collecting Environmental and Social \nImpact Data.  The third stage of the methodology \ninvolves collecting environmental and social impact \ndata for each life cycle stage identified in stage 2. \nThis data can be gathered through a combination of \nprimary and secondary sources, including database \nsearches and academic articles. LLMs is used to \nautomate the data collection process, and to identify \nthe relevant and up-to-date data sources. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStage 4: Interpreting and Evaluating.  The fourth \nstage of the methodology involves interpreting and \nevaluating the environmental and social impact data \ncollected in stage 3 based on CML 2001. This can be \ndone using a variety of impact assessment methods \nand tools, such as life cycle impact assessment \n(LCIA), sustainability assessment, and life cycle \ncosting (LCC). LLMs is used to automate the impact \nassessment process, and to provide more accurate \nand comprehensive results. \nStage 5: Building a web-based tool. The final stage \nof the methodology involves ChatGPT API \nintegration to Superblock in order to analyze the \nenvironmental impact potentials of the products \nand suggest improvements based on the results. The \nChatGPT was trained on the available qualitative and \nquantitative data for the first three steps in a \nfeedback-based conversati onal way, then it was \nasked to interpret and evaluate the data in the fourth \nstep, while generating results on defining \noptimization potentials in the last step. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 \nMethodology  \nVolume 2 – Digital Design Reconsidered – eCAADe 41 | 45\nIMPLEMENTATION  \nAfter specifying the unit of production, which was \ndefined as 1x2 m2 of a partition wall, data was \ncollected from the life cycle inventory databases, \nacademic articles and project reports. The collected \ndata was assessed in terms of quality and reliability \nthrough multiple comparisons. The environmental \nand social impacts of the product was then analyzed \nthrough CML 2001 impact assessment method. CML \n2001 impact assessment method, which is a widely \nused life cycle impact assessment method for \nenvironmental analysis of products, services and \nprocesses. It was developed by the Center for \nEnvironmental Science at Leiden University in the \nNetherlands. The CML 2001 method (Table 2) covers \na wide range of impact categories related to the \nenvironment, such as cl imate change (GWP100a), \nozone layer depletion (ODP), human toxicity (HTP),  \n \nfreshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (FWAETP), marine \naquatic ecotoxicity (MAETP),  terrestrial acidification \n(TAP), terrestrial eutrophication (TEP), \nphotochemical ozone creation (POCP), and \nparticulate matter formation (PMFP). It is often used \nin the construction sector for the environmental \nassessment of building materials, products, and \nsystems, as well as for the assessment of \ninfrastructure projects. The whole qualitative and \nquantitative data collected since the beginning of \nthe study, which covers the process from the \nproduction of BC biofilm to its disposal, was \nintroduced to OpenAI’s generative pre-trained \ntransformer ChatGPT for training on the desired data \nsets.

The \nproduction and transportation of wooden partitions \nhave higher impacts on cl imate change, fossil fuel \ndepletion, and water consumption. For instance, the \nGWP100a of the BC-based partition wall is 0.02 kg \nCO\n2 eq/m2, while the GWP100a of the wood partition \nwall is around 3.08 kg CO 2 eq/m2. The difference in \nimpact can also be observed in other categories as \nwell.  \n After the results were retrieved successfully, an \nonline browser-based pl atform (Figure 3) was \ndeveloped by using Superblocks, a blockchain \nplatform that allows developers to create \ndecentralized applications, by integrating the API of \nChatGPT to retrieve LCA for biobased materials. \nOnce the smart contracts are deployed, the API \nprovides a range of endpoints that allow developers \nto read and write data to the blockchain, as well as to \ninteract with smart contracts.  \n \nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION \nThe results of this study have shown that the \ndesigners can incorporate sustainable thinking in \nthe design process by using LLMs integrated to LCA, \nultimately contributing to a more sustainable future \nagainst the impacts of the Anthropocene. The \nproposed implementation of an online interface can \nalso be integrated into Building Information \nModeling (BIM) software such as Autodesk Revit and \nArchiCAD to streamline the process of data \ncollection and analysis in building design and \nconstruction. \nFuture studies can delve into the integration of \nthis tool into building information modeling \nsoftware or computational design software in order \nto perform LCA for 3D structures. Different scales of \nsuch applications in design practices, such as fashion \ndesign, product design or service design can also be \nconducted by questioning how LCA can be \ncombined with LLMs to leverage novel sustainable \ndesign solutions. \nREFERENCES \nMijwil, M.M., Aljanabi, M., and Ali, A.
