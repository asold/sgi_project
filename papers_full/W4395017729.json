INTRODUCTION\nT\nHe rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) empowered face\nmanipulation/generation technologies have enabled in-\ndividuals’ expressions or appearances to be realistically al-\ntered with minimal expert knowledge [1]–[6]. This technol-\nogy poses a severe and large-scale societal threat, as it fa-\ncilitates the creation and dissemination of malicious content,\nsuch as digital kidnapping, ransomware, and other forms of\ncriminal activity [7], [8] that are among the most insidious\nforms of misinformation [9]. Consequently, the development\nof reliable deepfake detection methods has become an urgent\nneed and has garnered significant attention in recent years.\nAlthough several efforts have been made to defend against\nthe growing threat of forged digital media, the effectiveness\nof these approaches have primarily been limited to in-dataset\nsettings [5], [10]–[17]. Therefore, the need to develop more\nrobust and effective deepfake detection methods that can op-\nerate in real-world scenarios irrespective of the forgery type,\nappearance, or quality has become increasingly pressing.\nIn the domain of deepfake detection, previous investiga-\ntions have predominantly relied upon low-level texture fea-\ntures to capture common artifacts that are inherent to the\ngeneration process. Nonetheless, such approaches are sus-\nceptible to severe performance degradation when applied to\nnovel types of forgeries, rendering the detection of real-world\ndeepfakes a challenging task, especially when the differences\nbetween genuine and manipulated media are nuanced. As\na result, an effective deepfake detection model ought to be\nimpartial towards forgery type, appearance, and quality, in\norder to ensure applicability in real-world scenarios. To this\nend, several techniques have been proposed to enhance the\nperformance and generalization of deepfake detectors, such\nas targeting the blending boundary between the background\nand the altered face [12], utilizing 3D decomposition [18],\ntruncating classifiers [19], amplifying multi-band frequen-\ncies [14], and augmenting data [20]. Despite their effective-\nVOLUME 11, 2023 1\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Consequently,\nit is imperative to develop novel high-level features that are\ninvariant to image manipulations and exhibit resilience to\npost-processing manipulations to enhance the current state-\nof-the-art in deepfake detection.\nMoreover, The widely-used convolutional neural network\nand Transformer treat the image as a grid or sequence struc-\nture, which is not flexible to capture irregular and complex\nfacial landmarks. Instead of the regular grid or sequence\nrepresentation, this work processes the deepfake image in a\nmore flexible way. Human facial images can be viewed as\na composition of parts, such as eyes, ears, nose, etc. These\nfacial regions naturally form a graph structure. This graph\nrepresentation of deepfakes offers a better understanding\nof local pixels and their interconnection with other parts.\nMoreover, the graph is a generalized data structure that grid\nand sequence can be viewed as a special case of the graph.\nViewing an image as a graph is more flexible and effective\nfor visual perception.\nGiven the limitations of existing methods, building a de-\ntection model that capitalizes on high-level visual represen-\ntations, which tend to be more resilient to post-processing\nperturbations, could potentially mitigate the dependence on\ndataset-specific patterns, leading to improved recognition\nperformance across various forgery types. In light of this, this\nstudy first proposes a self-supervised pre-training approach\nfor deepfake facial representation learning. This approach\nutilizes a contrastive learning framework based on masked\nimage modeling to extract high-level visual representations\nof facial landmarks that are invariant to variations in lighting,\npose, and other factors that are irrelevant to the identity of the\nobject or scene. The contrastive learning method maximizes\nthe agreement between two different augmentations of the\nsame image using a contrastive loss in the latent space [21]–\n[23]. This means that the learned representation is not biased\ntowards any particular class or label, but rather captures the\nunderlying structure of the input data.\nMoreover, the present work offers an innovative approach\nthat integrates the unique characteristics of Graph Convo-\nlutional Networks (GCNs) and Transformer architectures to\ncapture complex dependencies between distinct regions of\nan image and acquire more informative representations for\ndeepfake detection. In the context of deepfake detection,\nthe input data can be projected as a graph, wherein nodes\ndenote various regions of the image, such as eyes or ears, and\nedges represent the association between these regions. This is\nparticularly useful in detecting deepfakes, where only certain\nregions of the image may be manipulated to create realistic\nbut false identities. The utilization of GCNs allows for mod-\neling local relationships between nodes in the input graph,\nproviding the ability to learn complex features that capture\nthe spatial correlations between different facial landmarks.\nIn contrast, Transformers exhibit exceptional efficacy in en-\ncoding long-range correlations and global interdependencies\nbetween pixels, rendering them especially appropriate for\ndeepfake detection tasks. Given that adversarial entities can\nmanipulate multiple regions of an image concurrently, the\nability to model such complex relationships is crucial for\nreliable detection. Finally, this work introduces a graph Trans-\nformer relevancy map that contributes valuable insights into\nthe model’s explainability. By generating a saliency map that\nhighlights the importance of individual regions towards the\noutput class label, this component facilitates a more fine-\ngrained analysis of the model’s decision-making process and\nallows for a better understanding of the specific features and\nregions of the image that are crucial for deepfake detec-\ntion. Figure 1 shows the general framework of the proposed\ndeepfake detection model using a self-supervised contrastive\nlearning approach and graph Transformer architecture.\nContributions. Together, these contributions offer a promis-\ning solution to the urgent need for robust and effective deep-\nfake detection methods that can operate irrespective of the\nforgery types, appearances, or qualities in real-world scenar-\nios. The proposed framework’s use of high-level visual repre-\nsentations that are invariant to post-processing perturbations,\ncombined with the ability to capture complex interdependen-\ncies between regions of an image, provides a comprehensive\nsolution that outperforms existing methods. Below are the key\ncontributions of this study:\n• The present study introduces a self-supervised pre-\ntraining approach based on contrastive learning to ex-\ntract more high-level visual representations that are in-\nvariant to variations in compression, blur, and other\nfactors irrelevant to the subject’s identity.

DEEPFAKE DETECTION\nRecent years have witnessed a growing body of research\naimed at addressing the pressing challenges posed by deep-\nfakes and developing robust detection models capable of\nthwarting their nefarious effects on society. A variety of\ntechniques have been proposed in the literature to this end,\nwith a rich diversity of approaches being explored [8], [10]–\n[13], [16], [17], [24].\nOne popular strategy is to leverage the implicit visual arti-\nfacts of deepfakes’ generation process to construct a reliable\ndetection framework [12], [25]. These approaches capitalize\non the inconsistencies and discrepancies that inevitably arise\nduring the creation of deepfakes, such as blending artifacts\nor anomalies in the frequency spectrum. Examples of such\napproaches include Patch-wise Consistency Learning [26]\nand Face X-ray [12], which exploit image blending incon-\nsistency traces between the manipulated face region and the\nbackground. These approaches exemplify the diverse range\nof methods used to detect deepfakes, with some leveraging\nspecific visual artifacts while many mainstream deepfake de-\ntection methodologies rely heavily on the versatility of convo-\nlutional neural networks. For instance, [5], [8], [27], [28] rely\non the exceptional ability of convolutional neural networks\nto capture complex spatial features and relationships as the\nprimary building block of their proposed deepfake detection\nframework.\nAdditionally, recent research has explored alternative av-\nenues, such as analyzing the temporal dynamics of videos or\nusing frequency spectrum analysis to detect deepfakes based\non unique spectral signatures. For instance, the temporal dy-\nnamics of videos have been explored as a means to recongnize\nfake videos [29]–[32]. This approach involves examining the\ndirectional changes in the video’s temporal characteristics,\nthereby detecting any inconsistencies or abnormal patterns\nindicative of deepfakes. Furthermore, frequency spectrum\nanalysis is gaining significant traction in research interest\n[13]–[15], [33]–[36]. This technique capitalizes on leveraging\nthe identification of spectral signatures exhibited by deep-\nfakes, such as the existence of high-frequency noise or low-\npass filtering artifacts, enabling the detection of manipulated\ncontent.\nIn light of recent advancements in deepfake generation\ntechniques that have reduced the visual anomalies, the detec-\ntion methods have shifted focus towards more sophisticated\napproaches such as attention mechanisms [8], [16], [29], [37],\n[38] and vision Transformers [17], [24], [39]. For example,\nWang et al. [24] proposed a multi-regional attention mecha-\nnism to enhance deepfake detection performance. Addition-\nally, vision Transformers have been employed to establish\nan end-to-end deepfake detection framework [17], [40]. Fur-\nthermore, recent research has utilized pre-trained networks\nand developed Lipforensics [11] for analyzing lip prints in\nlip-reading tasks. This work highlights that while a robust\npre-trained lip feature extractor could have far-reaching im-\nplications, acquiring a large-scale and well-annotated dataset\ncould be a daunting task. Given the potential limitations of re-\nlying on annotated data, this study proposes a self-supervised\nvision Transformer for pretraining the feature extractor with-\nout the need for annotation or labels. The resulting framework\nis scalable and achieves good performance.\nB. SELF-SUPERVISED CONTRASTIVE LEARNING\nA meaningful visual representation of a given input image\ncould be learned through self-supervised contrastive learn-\ning methods without relying on labeled data [41]. Recently,\nself-supervised contrastive learning approaches have gained\ntremendous attention in building pre-trained models that can\nbe used for fine-tuning different downstream tasks. Con-\ntrastive learning maximizes the similarity between positive\npairs while repelling features of negative pairs [21]. Although\ncontrastive learning approaches have been utilized for dense\nvisual representation learning tasks [42], [43], recent studies\nsuggest that removing negative pairs yields better perfor-\nmances [44]–[47]. While Random augmentations have been\nwidely used to generate diverse views of the same image [21],\n[48], [49], this work, inspired by [50], proposes a masked\nimage modeling approach to extract more robust semantic\nfeatures through a contrastive learning methodology. In con-\ntrast to previous work that only focused on mouth regions for\nlip-forensics [51], this work leverages the entire facial region\nto improve the detection performance. The proposed masked\nimage modeling approach was utilized to train a pre-trained\nmodel, with a vision Transformer serving as its backbone.\nThrough this approach, complex semantic features from input\nimages were captured by the model, resulting in improved\ndeepfake detection performance.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 3\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

The general framework of the proposed deepfake detection model using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach and graph\nTransformer architecture. In this approach, each input image is partitioned into smaller patches, where each patch is considered as a node in an\nundirected graph. A feature extractor model based on vision transformer architecture, which is pre-trained based on contrastive learning methodology, is\nthen applied to each patch to obtain its visual features. These nodes and associated feature vectors are restructured in the form of a graph based on the\nadjacency matrix. The constructed graph is subsequently fed into a graph convolutional network, which is followed by a Transformer network that\nfunctions as a deepfake discriminator, with the purpose of forecasting image class labels. Finally, the Transformer relevancy map is utilized to identify\npotentially manipulated facial regions. The suggested deepfake detection mechanism capitalizes on the merits of both high-level visual characteristics\nand the interconnectivity of local and global regions through the pre-trained feature extractor and graph Transformer classifier, respectively.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nThe proposed deepfake detection method entails four fun-\ndamental components, as illustrated in Figure 1, which are\ndeepfake graph construction, deepfake encoder based on vi-\nsion Transformer architecture that is pre-trained using a self-\nsupervised contrastive learning approach, graph Transformer\nclassifier, and graph Transformer relevancy map. This section\nis dedicated to elaborating on each of these components in a\nmore comprehensive manner.\nA. DEEPFAKE GRAPH REPRESENTATION\nThe irregularity of facial regions’ shape constitutes a major\nobstacle in employing conventional techniques, such as grid-\nbased architectures in CNNs or sequence-based structures\nin Transformers, to process facial images. Such approaches\nare characterized by redundancy and inflexibility, rendering\nthem incapable of efficiently addressing the complex struc-\ntural nuances of facial regions. As a consequence, there is\na need for more sophisticated and adaptive techniques that\ncan account for the varying geometries and topologies of\nthese regions. In this regard, the present study advocates the\nadoption of graph representation of deepfakes as a highly\npromising method to tackle the issue of deepfake detection,\nowing to its capacity to account for the varying topologies and\ngeometries of the facial regions. By leveraging this approach\nto represent deepfake images as graphs, it becomes possible\nto capture the underlying structural and relational features of\nkey facial landmarks, such as the eyes, lips, and ears. This\ncapability, in turn, enables the identification of potentially\nmanipulated regions and their relationship within the image,\nthereby capturing more complex features for enhanced and\nrobust deepfake detection.\nThe construction of an undirected graph from an image\ninput is a pivotal step in the proposed deepfake detection\nmethodology. In essence, the process of representing a given\ninput image I as a graph G = ( V ,E) involves partitioning\nit into N patches, where V = {v1,v2, . . . ,vN } signifies the\nnodes of the graph and E denotes its corresponding edges.\nThis entails representing feature embeddings extracted from\nimage patches as graph nodes, denoted by vi ∈ RD, where D\nis the dimensionality of the embedding vector. The adjacency\nrelationship among these patches constitutes the graph edges\nE. Notably, edges within the graph are established by means\nof a spatial proximity criterion that determines the association\nof each patch with its neighboring counterparts, allowing for\nat least one, and up to K connections between K nearest\nneighboring patches. To encode the adjacency relationship\nbetween patches, an adjacency matrix, A = [ Aij], is formu-\nlated, is formulated, where Aij = Aji = 1 if the nodes vi and\nvj are in the neighborhoods, and Aij = Aji = 0 otherwise,\nthat is if (vi,vj) /∈ E. By modeling deepfake images in this\nway, the structural relationships and dependencies among the\nvarious facial components can be captured and analyzed in a\nmore comprehensive manner. Furthermore, the efficacy of the\nproposed methodology depends crucially on the feature vec-\ntor’s ability to provide a potent and resilient representation of\nthe node in question. To achieve this, the present study utilizes\nself-supervised contrastive learning and a vision Transformer\nstructure to extract high-level visual representations of deep-\nfake images. This enables the detection system to capture the\nsalient attributes of the underlying image regions, resulting in\nmore informative and discriminative features. As high-level\n4 VOLUME 11, 2023\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

SELF-SUPERVISED CONTRASTIVE LEARNING\nExisting deepfake detection methodologies heavily rely on\nweakly supervised learning approaches for visual feature ex-\ntraction. While such approaches exhibit high detection perfor-\nmance on in-distribution samples, their ability to generalize to\nunseen samples is limited. This generalizability issue poses\na significant challenge to real-world applications where the\nmodel must be robust to unseen scenarios. To overcome this\nissue, this study proposes the utilization of self-supervised\ncontrastive learning for robust visual feature extraction with-\nout the need for explicit labels. Specifically, the proposed\napproach employs masked image modeling, which applies\na random mask to an input image with N token sequences\nand a prediction ratio of r, to train a vision Transformer for\ngenerating patch representations. The model maximizes the\nconcordance between two distinct views of the same image\nthrough contrastive loss in a latent space. This approach\nis inspired by recent studies on self-supervised contrastive\nlearning, including [21], and builds on the successful applica-\ntion of masked image modeling in [50], [52]. Figure Figure 2\nillustrates the proposed self-supervised contrastive learning\nframework for deepfake representation learning. The result-\ning visual features are expected to be more informative and\ndiscriminative, improving the model’s ability to generalize\nto unseen data and achieve high performance on downstream\ntasks.\nThe proposed training methodology commences with the\nrandom selection of an image x from the training set, followed\nby the application of random augmentations to generate two\ndistorted views of the same image, denoted as u and v. To en-\nhance robustness, blockwise masking [50] is then applied to\nproduce masked views of the augmented images, denoted as\nˆu and ˆv. Subsequently, the masked views undergo processing\nby a student-teacher network to yield predictive categorical\ndistributions. Both the student and teacher networks share\nan identical architectural configuration and are parameterized\nby θ and θ′, respectively. This framework enables the self-\nsupervised training of the student network, which endeavors\nto reconstruct the masked tokens by leveraging the guidance\nof the teacher network’s output.\nIn self-supervised frameworks, it is customary for the stu-\ndent network to acquire distilled knowledge from the teacher\nnetwork by minimizing the cross-entropy loss [22], [44], [46].\nHowever, in the present study, the deepfake images’ visual\nrepresentations are acquired through the minimization of two\nconcurrent loss functions, namely: 1) L[CLS], which repre-\nsents the self-distillation between cross-view [CLS] tokens,\nand 2) L[MIM], which represents the self-distillation be-\ntween in-view patch tokens. Specifically, the self-distillation\nprocess regarding the [CLS] tokens of cross-view images,\ndenoted by u and v, can be formulated as a symmetric loss, as\nshown in Equation 1.\nL[CLS] = 1\n2\n\u0010\n−P[CLS]\nθ′ (v)T log P[CLS]\nθ (u)\n\u0011\n+\n1\n2\n\u0010\n−P[CLS]\nθ′ (u)T log P[CLS]\nθ (v)\n\u0011 (1)\nwhere uCLS\ns = PCLS\nθ (u), vCLS\ns = PCLS\nθ (v), uCLS\nt =\nPCLS\nθ′ (u), and vCLS\nt = PCLS\nθ′ (v) are student and teacher\nnetwork outputs for cross-view images, i.e.,u and v, of [CLS]\ntoken.\nThe student and teacher network outputs for the masked\nview with a given mi masking ratio for ˆu, ˆv and non-\nmasked view u, v projections of patch tokens are calculated\nas ˆupatch\ns = Ppatch\nθ (ˆu), ˆvpatch\ns = Ppatch\nθ (ˆv) and upatch\nt =\nPpatch\nθ′ (u), vpatch\nt = Ppatch\nθ′ (v), respectively. Similarly, the\nself-distillation between in-view patch tokens can be formu-\nlated as a symmetric cross-entropy loss as Equation 2.\nLMIM = = 1\n2\n \n−\nNX\ni=1\nmi · Ppatch\nθ′ (ui)T log Ppatch\nθ (ˆui)\n!\n+\n1\n2\n \n−\nNX\ni=1\nmi · Ppatch\nθ′ (vi)T log Ppatch\nθ (ˆvi)\n!\n(2)\nThe overall loss function is expressed as a combination\nof two individual loss functions, L[CLS] and LMIM, as pre-\nsented in Equation 3. The loss function L[CLS] involves self-\ndistillation between cross-view [CLS] tokens, whereas LMIM\nis related to self-distillation among in-view patch tokens.\nThe proposed approach leverages the collective information\nobtained from both loss functions to effectively learn the\ndeepfake image representations.\nL = L[CLS] + LMIM (3)\nC. GRAPH TRANSFORMER CLASSIFIER\nThe methodology employed in this study involves the use of\na vision Transformer as a feature extractor, which has been\ntrained using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach.\nThis approach is effective in computing the visual represen-\ntation of each node in the graph. An image representation\nmatrix F ∈RN×D is constructed by subjecting all N nodes\nwithin the image to the aforementioned pre-trained ViT fea-\nture extractor. Specifically, each node vi is associated with a\nfeature vector fi ∈ RD, where D denotes the dimensional-\nity of the feature vector. The resultant matrix is defined as\nF = {f1,f2, . . . ,fN }. It is noteworthy that the combination\nof F with the adjacency matrix A facilitates the construction\nof a graph representation of deepfake images. The resulting\ngraph-structured data can be analyzed using a multi-layer\ngraph convolutional network f (F,A) [53], which utilizes a\nlayer-wise propagation rule as specified in Equation 4.\nHl+1 = ReLU\n\u0010\nˆAHl Wl\n\u0011\n, l = 1,2, ..,L\nˆA = ˜D−1\n2 ˜A˜D−1\n2\n(4)\nhere, L represents the total number of graph convolution\nlayers, and the activation matrix of the lth graph convolutional\nVOLUME 11, 2023 5\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

General framework of the vision Transformer-based feature extractor trained through self-supervised contrastive learning. Given a deepfake\nimage, x, two different views,u and v, are passed through student and teacher networks. The student network tries to reconstruct masked tokens with\nthe supervision of teacher networks’ output by minimizing self-distillation between cross-view [CLS] tokens and self-distillation between in-view patch\ntokens.\nlayer is denoted as Hl . The activation matrix Hl captures the\nlearned representations at each layer, with the initialization of\nH0 as the input feature matrix F. The weight matrix Wl is spe-\ncific to each layer and is learned during training. Moreover,\nthe graph’s adjacency matrix with added self-connections to\neach node is represented by ˜A and is defined as the sum of\nthe adjacency matrix A and the identity matrix I. A diagonal\nmatrix ˜D is used to normalize the adjacency matrix, where ˜Dii\nis defined as the sum of the entries in row i of the normalized\nadjacency matrix ˜A. The resulting matrix ˆA is the symmetric\nnormalized adjacency matrix of A.\nAlthough graph convolutional layers have been successful\nin learning node-level features and have been widely used\nin graph neural networks, they have limitations in learning\nhierarchical visual features that capture the global context\nof the graph. In contrast, the attention mechanism in Trans-\nformer models has shown remarkable success in natural lan-\nguage processing tasks by capturing the long-range depen-\ndencies between tokens and their relative importance for the\nfinal prediction [54]. This ability is particularly important\nin graph-structured deepfake images, where the relationships\nbetween nodes can be complex and far-reaching. Therefore,\nthe present work proposes to leverage attention mechanisms\nto analyze graph-structured data by treating the feature nodes\nas tokens in a sequence, and adjacency matrices as positional\nencodings to preserve their spatial relationship. By synergiz-\ning the attention mechanism with graph convolutional layers,\nthe proposed model proficiently assimilates both localized\nand global features, and adeptly captures intricate inter-nodal\nrelationships within the graph. Notably, the transformation\nof graph space data into Transformer space is enacted via a\nTransformer layer, as specified in Equation 5 to Equation 8.\nz0 =\nh\nxclass; h(1); h(2); . . .; h(N)\ni\n, h(i) ∈ H (5)\nz′\nℓ = MSA (LN (zℓ−1)) + zℓ−1, ℓ = 1 . . .L (6)\nzℓ = MLP (LN (z′\nℓ)) + z′\nℓ, ℓ = 1 . . .L (7)\ny = LN\n\u0000\nz0\nL\n\u0001\n(8)\nHere, the model architecture entails a multihead self-\nattention mechanism MSA, featuring k Self-Attention (SA)\nheads, as delineated in Equation 10 and Equation 9, respec-\ntively. Furthermore,MLP represents a Multilayer Perceptron,\nand Layer Norm is indicated by LN. Here, L corresponds\nto the number of Transformer blocks, and y signifies the\nclass label [55]. The Transformer model utilizes the graph\nfeature embeddings, as outlined in Equation 4, to facilitate\nself-attention operation SA (Q,K,V ), based on Transformer\narchitecture as presented in Equation 10.\nMSA (Q,K,V ) = Concat (SA1, . . . ,SAk) W O\nwhere SAi = SA\n\u0010\nQW Q\ni ,KW K\ni ,VW V\ni\n\u0011 (9)\nSA (Q,K,V ) = softmax\n\u0012QKT\n√dk\n\u0013\nV (10)\nwhere, N represents the number of patches, D is the di-\nmension of patch embeddings, and SA (Q,K,V ) denotes the\npairwise similarity of two nodes based on their correspond-\ning Query (Qin), Key (K), and Values (V ). Notably, the\nprojections are parameter matrices W Q\ni ∈ RD×dk ,W K\ni ∈\nRD×dk ,W V\ni ∈ RD×dv and W O ∈ Rkdv×D [54], [55].\nFinally, it is imperative to acknowledge that the conven-\ntional self-attention mechanism computes attention scores for\nall possible pairs of nodes, leading to an exponential increase\nin memory and time complexity as the number of nodes\nincreases, with a complexity of O(n2). Thus, a technique that\nreduces the number of nodes while retaining local informa-\ntion is indispensable. In this investigation, a learnable pooling\nlayer, referred to as the min-cut pooling layer [56], has been\nemployed on the output of the final graph convolutional layer\nto effectively reduce the number of nodes.\n6 VOLUME 11, 2023\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

GRAPH TRANSFORMER RELEVANCY MAP\nTo pinpoint areas within a given image that are likely to have\nbeen manipulated, and which exhibit a significant correlation\nwith deepfake class labels, the present study builds upon\nprevious research in this field [57] and presents a graph Trans-\nformer relevancy map. This innovative approach involves\ncomputing the class activation maps from the output class\nand then propagating them to the inner graph space through\na propagation procedure. The current study shows that the\nattention relevancy of the ℓth Transformer block ¯A(ℓ) can be\nobtained by representing the attention map of its Transformer\nblock as Aℓ, which facilitates the calculation of the layer\nrelevance score Rnℓ and gradient ∇A(ℓ) values pertaining to\nclass t. It should be noted that nℓ corresponds to the layer\nthat aligns with the softmax operation in the ℓth Transformer\nblock. Finally, as depicted in Figure 3 the Transformer’s\nfinal relevancy maps are represented by a weighted attention\nrelevance, as described by Equation 11.\n¯A(ℓ) = Eh\n\u0010\n∇A(ℓ) ⊙ R(nl )\n\u0011\n+ I\nCt = ¯A(1) · ¯A(2) · . . .· ¯A(L)\n(11)\nHere, Eh signifies the mean value calculated across the\ndimension of the self-attention heads of the Transformer\nmodel, whereas ⊙ denotes the Hadamard product. To pre-\nvent self-inhibition for each node, the identity matrix I is\nadded. In the final step, the Transformer relevance map Ct is\nmapped to each node in the graph, based on the min-cut dense\nlearned assignments [56]. This min-cut approach ensures that\nthe most relevant nodes are assigned the highest relevance\nscores, thereby facilitating more accurate identification of\nmanipulated regions within an image. The proposed method-\nology represents a significant advancement in deepfake detec-\ntion and image forensics, by incorporating a highly effective\ngraph-based approach with Transformer architectures that\nimproves accuracy and enhances practical utility.\nIV. EVALUATION SETTINGS\nThe present section endeavors to appraise the performance\nand efficacy of the proposed methodology through a series\nof challenging experiments, and subsequently compare the\nresults against those achieved by current state-of-the-art tech-\nniques.\nA. DATASETS\nTraining datasets.In accordance with recent developments\nin the field of deepfake detection [12], [13], [17], [35], [36],\nthis study endeavors to evaluate the efficacy and performance\nof the proposed self-supervised graph Transformer model\nagainst different real-world settings through a comprehensive\nset of experiments. To this end, the model is trained and evalu-\nated using several well-established and challenging deepfake\nforensics datasets, including FaceForensics++ [5], Celeb-DF\n(V2) [4], and WildDeepfake [6]. A concise overview of these\ndatasets is provided below.\nFaceForensics++. The FaceForensics++ dataset encom-\npasses a diverse range of four distinct types of im-\nage forgeries, specifically Deepfakes [58], FaceSwap [59],\nFace2Face [60], and NeuralTextures [61]. The FaceForen-\nsics++ dataset is thoughtfully curated and available in three\nvarying compression rates, namely heavily compressed (LQ),\nslightly compressed (HQ), and uncompressed (Raw). While\nthe Raw dataset exhibits relatively facile identification of\ndeepfakes, the process becomes considerably more challeng-\ning with higher compression rates. In this manuscript, the\nHQ version of the dataset is predominantly utilized, unless\nspecified otherwise. Celeb-DF (V2). The Celeb-DF (V2)\ndataset represents a significant advancement in synthetic\nvideo generation due to its superior face-swapping strategy\nthat elevates its visual quality above previous efforts. The\ndataset encompasses an extensive collection of 5639 videos,\nall of which exhibit a high level of visual quality, making it\nan ideal resource for training and testing deepfake detection\nmodels. WildDeepfake. The WildDeepfake is a collection of\nfabricated videos sourced entirely from the Internet, making it\na distinct and demanding real-world dataset. Unlike other AI-\ngenerated deepfakes, such as Celeb-DF (V2) and FaceForen-\nsics++, the WildDeepfake dataset incorporates multiple facial\nexpressions and encompasses a wider range of scenarios, with\nnumerous individuals appearing in each scene.\nTesting datasets.In addition to the aforementioned datasets,\nthe official test set of several additional benchmarks are\nutilized to investigate the generalizability of the proposed\nmodel. Specifically, these benchmarks are the DeeperForen-\nsics [2], FaceShifter [62], and DeepFake Detection Chal-\nlenge (DFDC) [1] datasets. The DeeperForensics dataset\ncontains over 11,000 synthetic videos generated by lever-\naging a specific Variational Auto-Encoder (V AE) on the\nreal videos from FaceForensics++. Similarly, the FaceShifter\ndataset is a collection of videos created by applying ad-\nvanced face-swapping techniques to the real videos from\nthe same dataset.

IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICS\nDeepfake Encoder Training.The present study adopts an\narchitecture based on vision Transformers [55] as the fun-\ndamental building block of the feature extractor f , which is\ntrained through the utilization of the previously mentioned\ncontrastive learning approach expounded upon in §III-B.\nSpecifically, the feature extractor model undergoes pre-\ntraining and fine-tuning on images of size 320 × 320, with\npatch sizes of 20×20 yielding a total of 256 patch tokens. The\nprojection head h, which plays a central role in feature extrac-\ntion, is established using a multi-layer perceptron compris-\ning three layers. Importantly, to foster effective information\nsharing between the CLS and the patch tokens, the projection\nhead parameters are shared, notably, hs\n[CLS] = hs\npatch and\nht\n[CLS] = ht\npatch. This enables the feature extractor model\nto capitalize on both the global and local context provided by\nthe CLS and patch tokens, respectively. The training regimen\nis executed for 800 epochs with a learning rate that exhibits\na linearly scaled progression following the batch size, as\ndetermined by the expression: lr = 5e−4 × batchsize/256.\nThe preeminent implementation specifications at hand en-\ntail the pre-training of a self-supervised feature extractor\non a conflation of training sets procured from three distinct\nbenchmarks explicated in §IV-A.\nUpon the conclusion of training, the parameters of the fea-\nture extractor are fixed and employed as a pre-trained feature\nextractor for the purpose of node feature vector extraction,\nwhich in turn facilitates the representation of the deepfake\nimages as a graph. The graph Transformer classifier is com-\nprised of a graph convolutional layer, and three blocks of\nTransformer layers, each of which comprises 8 self-attention\nheads, a dimensional parameter of D=256, and an MLP size\nof 512 (Equation 10). This construction is indicative of the\nsophistication that underlies the proposed approach.\nThe experimental evaluation of the proposed framework\nwas carried out on a Lambda Quad deep learning work-\nstation machine equipped with 4 NVIDIA GeForce GTX\n1080 Ti Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), 64 GB DDR4\nRAM, an Intel Core™ i7-6850K CPU, and running the Ubuntu\n20.04.3 LTS operating system. This machine configuration\nfacilitated the efficient training and evaluation of the models,\nthanks to its high-performance computing capabilities. The\nperformance evaluation of the proposed framework was con-\nducted using accuracy and area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUC) metrics in different experimental\nsettings. Comprehensive assessment of the proposed frame-\nwork’s performance was enabled through the use of these\nTABLE 1.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION\nTo fully ascertain the proficiency of the presented deepfake\ndetection framework, an exhaustive set of experiments was\nconducted, with a multifaceted approach to examine its per-\nformance across various perspectives. The scope of investi-\ngation encompassed the generalization ability of the frame-\nwork in detecting deepfakes originating from heterogeneous\ndatasets and manipulation techniques, as well as its resistance\nagainst compression and perturbations, and other ablation\nstudies that are critical in appraising the framework’s efficacy.\nTo this end, three distinct models were meticulously trained\nand evaluated in an in-dataset setting using each of the preem-\ninent deepfake forensics datasets, namely FaceForensics++,\nCeleb-DF (V2), and WildDeepfake, with the corresponding\naccuracy rate and AUC scores reported in Table 1.\nA. CROSS DATASET GENERALIZATION\nThe proliferation of fake videos in the real world poses a\nformidable challenge for the deployment of deepfake detec-\ntion models, given the diverse forgery techniques, hetero-\ngeneous source videos, and extensive post-processing tech-\nniques. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of\nany deployed deepfake detection model from a domain gen-\neralization perspective. Although evaluating domain general-\nization is complicated due to significant disparities between\ndeepfake forensics datasets, this can be addressed through\n8 VOLUME 11, 2023\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

This study adopts a similar approach\nto the existing literature by utilizing the training set of the\nFaceForensics++ dataset to construct a deepfake detection\nmodel and then evaluate its performance on other datasets.\nMore specifically, the model is trained on four distinct types\nof forgeries that make up the FaceForensics++ dataset. The\nmodel’s performance is then evaluated on the test sets of four\nseparate benchmark deepfake detection datasets, including\nDeeperForensics [2], FaceShifter [62], Deepfake Detection\nChallenge [1], and Celeb-DF (V2) [4]. This evaluation pro-\ncess aims to determine the model’s ability to generalize across\ndifferent forgery techniques and datasets, thus assessing its\ndomain generalization capabilities. It is noteworthy that this\nevaluation setup is exceedingly arduous since the original\nand forged videos in DFDC and Celeb-DF (V2) are different\nfrom those in FaceForensics++ and were not seen during the\ntraining process.\nThe results obtained from this cross-dataset evaluation are\npresented in Table 2. Based on the results shown in the table,\nit is evident that the proposed graph Transformer model out-\nperforms all other methods in terms of average AUC scores,\nachieving an impressive score of 90.8%. The RealForensics\nmethod comes in second place with an average AUC score of\n90.5%, while other methods have lower scores, ranging from\n63.1% to 89.7%. It is worth noting that some methods, such as\nFace X-ray and DSP-FWA, perform well on specific datasets\nbut have lower scores on others. This indicates that their\nperformance may be dataset-dependent and may not gener-\nalize well across different datasets. On the other hand, the\npresented method in this study and some other methods, such\nas FTCN, DFDT, and RealForensics, achieve consistently\nhigh scores across all datasets, indicating that they are robust\nand generalize well across different datasets. In particular,\nthe presented method achieves the highest AUC score on the\nDeeperForensics, FaceShifter, and Celeb-DF (V2) datasets\nand the second-highest score on the DFDC dataset. It is\npertinent to mention that due to the fact that DeeperForensics\nand FaceShifter utilize the same source videos as FaceForen-\nsics++, they tend to perform better than DFDC and Celeb-\nDF (V2) in terms of deepfake detection. This is because the\nmodels have already been trained on similar data, making it\neasier for them to generalize to these datasets.\nB. CROSS MANIPULATION GENERALIZATION\nIn the real world, deepfakes can be generated using vari-\nous techniques, including different source videos and post-\nprocessing methods, resulting in a vast array of manipulated\nvideos. A deepfake detection model that is only trained on\na specific dataset may fail to detect deepfakes generated\nusing different techniques, rendering the model ineffective.\nTherefore, any deployed deepfake detection algorithm must\nperform well on unseen forgery types [11], [12], [63], [65].\nThis means that cross-manipulation generalization is critical\nfor deepfake detection as it enables the detection model to\nperform effectively on unseen and potentially more sophisti-\ncated manipulated videos. To this end, the cross-manipulation\nTABLE 3. Cross-manipulation generalization results on FaceForensics++\ndataset.

Robustness of the model against different compression levels.\nModels are trained over the FaceForensics++ dataset with a compression\nlevel of 23 and evaluated against five different compression levels.\nsented in Table 4. It can be observed that while competi-\ntive generalization was demonstrated by the proposed graph\nTransformer model when the compression level was kept con-\nstant during training and testing. However, a significant drop\nin performance was noted once tested against compressed\nsamples, as evidenced in Figure 4. This is unsurprising, given\nthat highly compressed images are subject to the loss of\ntextural features and low-level clues. Therefore, FTCN and\nLipForensics were highly affected by compression levels.\nHowever, the proposed self-supervised graph transformer\nmodel achieves slightly better performances as it leverages\nhigh-level facial representations, which are less susceptible\nto low-level artifacts.\nD. RESILIENCE TO PERTURBATION\nGiven that real-world forgeries are vulnerable to various\nforms of corruption on social media, such as saturation,\ncontrast, blur, etc., it is essential that the deployed deepfake\ndetector can withstand such post-processing perturbations.\nThe procedure proposed in [11] is taken into account to\ninvestigate the resilience of the model against common post-\nprocessing filters, including applying Gaussian noise & blur,\nmodifying saturation & contrast, pixelation, and block-wise\nocclusions [2]. The model is trained over grayscale clips of\nthe FaceForensics++ dataset, with only horizontal flipping\nand random cropping augmentations, and evaluated against\nfive different intensity levels of aforementioned perturba-\ntions. The resulting average AUC scores are listed in Table 5.\nThe presented graph Transformer model is significantly less\nvulnerable to aforementioned corruptions compared to other\nmethods that utilize low-level cues such as Patch-based and\nFace X-ray. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms\nFTCN and LipForensics, while exhibiting comparable results\nto RealForensics, thus showcasing its competitive perfor-\nmance.\nE. COMPARISON WITH SOTA\nA comprehensive evaluation was carried out to assess the\nsuperiority of the presented deepfake detection framework\nover state-of-the-art models. In particular, the model’s per-\nformance was compared against state-of-the-art deepfake\ndetection models that were trained and tested using same\ndatasets, and the resultant outcomes are presented in Table 6.\nRemarkably, the model exhibited competitive performance\nwhen evaluated on the FaceForensics++ dataset, while out-\nperforming other models when tested on Celeb-DF (V2)\nand WildDeepfake datasets. The obtained results unequivo-\ncally highlight the exceptional potency of the proposed graph\nTransformer model, underscored by its superlative generaliz-\nability attributable to the high-level deepfake representations\nobtained by a self-supervised framework. Furthermore, the\nproposed model’s ability to leverage the underlying graph\nstructure of the deepfake images enables the identification of\nboth local and global subtle discrepancies and artifacts that\nmay evade detection using traditional methods. This high-\nlights the significance of the proposed model, which offers a\ncompelling alternative to existing deepfake detection methods\nand has the potential to significantly enhance the reliability\nand robustness of deepfake detection systems.\nF. ABLATION STUDIES AND MODEL CONFIGURATION\nThe proposed framework was comprehensively evaluated\nthrough a series of meticulous ablation studies, aiming to in-\nvestigate the role of different components of the model and its\nhyperparameter values.

The combination of\nvisual representations obtained from the proposed construc-\ntive learning vision Transformer architecture with the graph\nTransformer classifier exhibited superior performance com-\npared to utilizing a pre-trained feature extractor, specifically\nResNet50, in combination with the same graph Transformer\nclassifier.\nA series of experiments were conducted using both sets\nof feature extractors to investigate different hyperparameters’\nimpacts. For example, the influence of the number of included\nneighboring patches, denoted as K, on the graph construction\nprocess and the overall efficacy of the deepfake detection task\nis investigated. Table 7 reveals that the best performance\nwas achieved when K = 8 . Smaller values of K yield a\nreduction in the receptive field of the constructed graph,\nconsequently resulting in lower performance. Lastly, the im-\npact of other critical hyperparameters, such as the number of\ngraph convolutional layers and the number of Transformer\nblocks, on the overall performance of the deepfake detection\npipeline is investigated. The obtained results demonstrated a\nslight degradation in performance when the number of graph\nconvolution layers decreased from three layers to one layer.\nThis observation can be attributed to the concept of node\nreceptive field, where a greater number of graph convolution\nlayers allows for the incorporation of long-term information\nduring model development. Moreover, it was observed that\nutilizing three Transformer blocks facilitated more effective\npooling of discriminative information, leading to improved\nperformance in deepfake detection tasks.\nThe conducted ablation studies collectively showcased the\nsuperior performance of the proposed self-supervised graph\nTransformer framework for deepfake detection.

Furthermore, the current\nwork leverages the expressive power of graph convolutional\nnetworks and Transformer blocks to capture intricate inter-\ndependencies among both local and global regions of an im-\nage, rendering them particularly suited to deepfake detection\ntasks. In addition, the proposed graph Transformer relevancy\nmap provides a comprehensive understanding of the com-\nplex interdependencies and salient features which leads to\nenhanced transparency and accountability of the detection\nmodel. Finally, the efficacy and generalizability of the pro-\nposed framework were rigorously evaluated via a comprehen-\nsive set of experiments, encompassing a diverse range of chal-\nlenging scenarios spanning both in-distribution and out-of-\ndistribution settings. The experimental results unequivocally\nestablish the framework’s superiority, with exceptional in-\ndataset detection accuracy being achieved. Moreover, the pro-\nposed self-supervised pre-training feature extractor consti-\ntutes a significant contribution to the field, having markedly\nimproved the framework’s ability to generalize across multi-\nple datasets while simultaneously enhancing its resilience to\npost-processing perturbations, such as compression and blur.\nREFERENCES\n[1] B.
