These power electronics-\nresources do not offer rotational inertia, resulting in a decrease\nof the total system inertia and thus in larger frequency deviations\nduring disturbances. Among several corrective solutions studied\nin literature, controlling the load consumption is a promising\none. Fast in power response and widely distributed in the grid,\nload control is able to work as power reserve (both upwards and\ndownwards) during frequency variations. In this regard, a Smart\nTransformer (ST) based solution is proposed. The ST is able to\nshape load consumption accurately by means of an On-Line Load\nsensitivity Identiﬁcation-based (OLLI) control, and can support\nthe primary frequency regulation in the power system. This paper\npresents an ST-based Real Time Frequency Regulation (RTFR)\ncontroller that varies load consumption by means of a voltage-\nbased load control, in response to the frequency deviation in the\npower grid. The proposed method is described analytically and\ntested by means of a Power-Hardware-In-Loop experiments, in\norder to show the effectiveness of the RTFR controller in real\ntime conditions and applications.\nIndex Terms—Smart Transformer, Solid State Transformer,\nload sensitivity identiﬁcation, frequency regulation, load control,\ndemand response.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nT\nHe increasing integration of Distributed Generation\n(DG), due to the converter-based connection, reduces the\ninertia of the grid, increasing frequency deviation following\ndisturbances. A reduced grid inertia can affect the grid stability\nin the most severe cases [1] [2]. With this assumption, an\nunexpected event (e.g., fault, generator disconnection, or line\ntripping) challenges the stability of the system. A violation of\nthe power quality standard (under- or over-voltage/frequency\nviolations) can occur, and, in extreme cases, it may trigger a\ncascade of failures that leads to regional or national blackouts.\nControl actions for supporting the frequency are based on\nﬁrm under-frequency load shedding [3], inertia control and\nfrequency droop characteristic of wind turbines [4] [5], and\nThe research leading to these results has received funding from the\nEuropean Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework\nProgramme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant Agreement n.

The advantages in\ncontrolling the load consumption lie on the distributed avail-\nability of control points in the grid and the fast dynamics in\nresponding to operator requests [9]. For example, the demand\nresponse strategy enables the use of the demand consumption\nas spinning reserve in the case of active power deﬁciency [10]\nor to provide primary frequency regulation support [11]–[13].\nHowever, several issues are expected in this direction, due to\nthe need of a large communication infrastructure and privacy\nconcerns on the data requested by smart meters, that may limit\nthe application of demand response [14]. As an alternative,\nthe load consumption can be modulated by controlling the\ngrid voltage [15], [16] or using the concept of Electric Spring\n(ES) [17]–[20]. Exploiting voltage-sensitive loads, the voltage\ncan be varied to adapt the load consumption to the desired\nlevel. This gives the possibility to manage load consumption\nin a practical and manageable manner, without involving\ncomplex and extensive communication infrastructure. As noted\nin [16], load power controllability in the order of 2 GW can\nbe achieved in UK. In addition to the academia proposal,\nENTSO-E has shown interest in letting the loads participate\nto services provision [21], whereas in countries like France,\nSpain, Belgium and Poland, loads can participate actively to\nbalancing services.\nAn overview of the power system is shown graphically in\nFig. 1, where several agents are involved in frequency regula-\ntion: conventional synchronous generators vary their power\noutput ∆Gi through governors action and energy storage\nsystems or High V oltage DC (HVDC) systems can respond\nto frequency variations by adapting their power output ∆Ei.\nIn the case of the HVDC systems, a Frequency Limit\nControl [8], [22] can be implemented, exploiting the fast\nramp characteristics offered by the power electronics. In the\ncase of frequency variation, the HVDC can provide an excess\nor a reduction of power in order to compensate for the\nfrequency oscillation. Although an effective solution, given\nthe availability of a considerable power reserve, to reduce the\nimpact on the power systems, rate limiters are used to shape\nthe power variation proﬁle.\nAs highlighted in Fig. 1, this paper proposes a ”Real Time\nFrequency Regulation” (RTFR) controller, realized by Smart\nTransformers (STs), power electronics transformer that in-\nterface the MV and LV grids.

Reactive power of the MV\ngrid is unaffected because of the power electronics.\nThe paper is structured as follows: section II describes\nthe Smart Transformer concept and the Real Time Frequency\nRegulation controller is explained; the contribution of the\nRTFR controller to the frequency regulation in the power grid\nis shown in section III; the validity of the approach is tested\nby means of a Power-Hardware-In-Loop setup described in\nsection IV , and the results shown in section V . Section VI\ndraws the conclusion.\nII. ST- BASED REAL TIME FREQUENCY REGULATION\nCONTROL\nThe Smart Transformer is a power-electronic based trans-\nformer [23] [24], which can shape the load consumption of\nvoltage-sensitive loads controlling the output voltage wave-\nform [25]. An on-line estimation of the active power load\nsensitivity to voltage (as in [26]) allows for a high control\naccuracy of voltage-based control actions.\nA. Concept and Control\nIn Fig. 2 two alternative ST asynchronously-connection\nsolution are shown: (a) the solid state transformer (SST)\n(Fig. 2a), with the isolation in the DC/DC stage, and (b)\nthe back-to-back solution (Fig. 2b), where the isolation is\nguaranteed by an external conventional transformer. Both con-\nﬁgurations allow for the independent control of the distribution\ngrid. It may be argued that the initial investment for STs can be\nhigher than other proposed methods. However, business cases\ndeveloped within LV-ENGINE project have demonstrated that\nthe ST can bring cost savings up to £60mby 2030 and more\nthan £500mby 2050 at national level in UK [27], and reduce\ngrid infrastructure reinforcements, like larger cables or higher\nratings transformers.\nRTFR\nPower System\nFig. 2. Frequency regulation by means of ( a) Solid State Transformer-based\nST, and ( b) back-to-back ST solution.\nThe RTFR controller shown in Fig. 2 can help regulate large\nfrequency variations in the power system and thus avoid the\nactivation of load shedding schemes.\nTo achieve the desired power change, the active power load\nsensitivity to voltage has to be calculated in advance. It has\nalready been demonstrated in [26], that, the ST, by means\nof the OLLI algorithm, is able to estimate load sensitivity\nin real time and to update it within a certain time interval.\nThe sensitivity measurement only lasts few seconds so it can\nbe repeated every few minutes or more often, if deemed\nnecessary. The basic idea of the OLLI is to apply a ramp\nvariation of the chosen variable (e.g., voltage) and to measure\nthe active and reactive power consumption during the ramp,\nallowing the voltage and frequency load sensitivity coefﬁcients\ncomputation. In this paper, only the voltage dependence of\nload active power is considered. The ST-fed grid is asyn-\nchronously connected to the main power system. Whereas\nthe active power consumption has an impact on main grid\nfrequency, the load reactive power is provided by the LV\nconverter without affecting on the main power system. The\n\n3\nconcept to vary the voltage to control a certain load has been\nalso explored with the Electric Spring concept [17], [18],\nwhere the voltage across a non-critical load is controlled to\nshape the power consumption for providing services to the\ngrid (e.g., voltage regulation). However, the Smart Transformer\ndoes not require active/reactive support to control load power,\nwhile it can also control reactive power injection in the MV\ngrid. Also, the Electric Spring has to be implemented in each\nload, and thus it requires to be spread in the distribution\ngrid, whereas, the Smart Transformer replaces the conventional\ntransformer, and thus has higher control.\nB. Control Implementation\nAt speciﬁed time instants during the voltage variation the\nline currents and phase-to-ground voltages are measured, and\nthe single-phase active and reactive powers P and Qand rms\nvoltage V are calculated. Using the measured values at time tk\nand the previous time instant tk−1, the active power sensitivity\nto voltage Kp and Kq at time tk are computed as in [26]:\nKp =\nP(tk)−P(tk−1)\nP(tk−1)\nV (tk)−V (tk−1)\nV (tk−1)\n(1)\nThis sequence is repeated in the following time instant until the\nend of the voltage ramp. The ﬁnal value of the sensitivities\nis obtained averaging all the values stored during the time\nwindow considered.\nOnce the active power sensitivity to voltage is calculated\nfor all three phases, the balanced voltage V to be applied to\nobtain the desired power variation ∆P is derived, as described\nin [25]:\nV = ∆P + (PAKpA + PBKpB + PCKpC)\nPA\nVA\nKpA + PB\nVB\nKpB + PC\nVC\nKpC\n(2)\nwhere KpA, KpB, and KpC are the active power sensitivity\nto voltage in phase A, B, and C respectively. Assuming the\ninitial three phase voltages with equal amplitude simpliﬁes (2)\nusing VA=VB=VC=V0:\nV\nV0\n= 1 + ∆P\nPAKpA + PBKpB + PCKpC\n(3)\nThus the p.u. voltage variation to be applied for achieving\na certain power variation ∆P is obtained. The voltage set-\npoint, however, must be constrained within the minimum and\nthe maximum voltage limit.\nThe power set-point ∆P is calculated by measuring system\nfrequency in the MV side of the ST. As shown in Fig. 3,\nif a variation of frequency is measured, the controller sets\nthe power modulation ∆P∗ following the droop characteristic\nshown in Fig. 4. A dead-band (e.g. d = ±200 mHz) is\nassumed, in order to avoid the ST intervention in case of small\nfrequency variations, caused by temporary load/generation\nunbalances. This value has been chosen in order to have a\ndead-band 10 times bigger than the one implemented in the\ngenerators governor: in [28] it is stated that the generator dead-\nband may vary from 0.02 % to 0.06 % of the nominal speed,\nthat corresponds to 10 mHz to 30 mHz for a 50 Hz system,\nP, V, I\nLimit\nController\nLoad\nIdentiﬁcation\nVoltage and \nCurrent Controller\nReal Time Frequency Controller\nLV\nGrid\nMV\nGrid\nFig. 3.

Lower case letters in Fig. 3 (e.g. v, i) refer to\ninstantaneous values v(t), i(t).\nSince the proposed system implies a closed-loop control,\nthe damping effect could be achieved even without a precise\nsystem identiﬁcation. However, with the OLLI algorithm, the\npower can be precisely controlled, offering superior service\nquality and guaranteeing to the customers that the curtailment\nis within the terms of agreement. The power modulation\nrequest ∆P∗ is limited, as seen in Fig. 4, in order to maintain\nthe power quality in the ST-fed LV grids. If the ST measures\na frequency deviation, it applies the voltage variation to\nshape the load consumption, applying relation (3). In order\nto limit the power quality impact on the LV grid, the ST\nrestores the voltage nominal value after the frequency transient\nends and the frequency value is inside the controller dead-\nzone. The RTFR goal is to support synchronous generators\nduring primary frequency control, increasing system damping,\ndecreasing transient frequency deviations, and not to provide\nsecondary frequency regulation. Since the secondary frequency\nregulation lasts for tens of minutes, the ST-fed loads could be\naffected by large voltage deviations (e.g., ±5%) for several\nminutes, decreasing the quality of the service for a too long\ntime window.\n\n4\nGovernor\n Turbine Power system inertia\nand load damping\nConventional Generation ST\ncontribution\nVariable load\nand generation\nFig. 5. Equivalent power system model with ST RTFR controller (in blue).\nC. Voltage dependent loads in distribution grids\nSince the RTFR approach exploits the load dependence on\nvoltage, it is of concern to discuss the availability of such loads\nin distribution grid. In recent years, the control of electric\nappliances goes more in the constant power load direction,\ndue to the converter interface with the grid. However, a large\namount of voltage dependent loads are still present in the\ndistribution grid. As highlighted in [29], these loads, such as\nair conditioner, induction lights, microwaves, and refrigerators,\nhave a consistent constant impedance contribution in the power\nabsorption. If these loads are considered in a residential grid\ntogether with other constant power loads, the aggregate load\nis still sensitive to voltage variation, even if in less-than-\nlinear way (i.e., Kp < 1 pu) [29]. Field experiments have\nbeen carried out to determine the aggregate load sensitivity to\nvoltage. In [30], the Serbian distribution grid showed voltage\nsensitivity Kp varying from 1.1 pu to 1.4 pu, that indicates a\nmore-than-linear power change following a voltage variation.\nIn a more recent publication [16], ﬁeld trials have shown that\nthe UK distribution network behaves as constant current load\n(i.e., Kp ≈ 1 pu), guaranteeing reasonable power margin for\nvoltage-based control actions.\nThus the RTFR control by means of Smart Transformer is\na viable solution to provide primary frequency regulation.\nIII. S YSTEM FREQUENCY REGULATION ANALYSIS\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the RTFR controller\nto regulate the transmission grid frequency, the frequency\nregulation loop shown in Fig. 5 is considered.\nThe analyzed system consists of an equivalent governor -\nturbine (reheat steam system), the rotating machines inertia\nand load self-regulation. The governor control is represented\nwith a frequency/power droop characteristic −1/R. The gov-\nernor dynamic behavior is simulated with a ﬁrst-order transfer\nfunction with time constant TG. The turbine transfer function\nincludes the reheater time constant TRH, the power fraction\nof the high pressure section of the turbine FHP , and the time\nconstant of the main inlet volume TCH . R is the governor\ndroop. The output of the turbine is the mechanical power\nvariation ∆Pm. The equilibrium of the system is reached\nwhen the mechanical power is exactly equal to the electrical\npower. When the two powers are not balanced, the frequency\ndeviation ∆ωr becomes non-zero. The system has inertia\nM and a load damping factor D, to emulate the load self-\nregulation [31]. The equivalent system parameters are listed\nin Table I. Several turbines with different time constants and\ntransient behavior can be considered, however, the frequency\nsupport impact will not differ substantially from case to case.\nThis power system linear model has been chosen due to the\nsimplicity in analyzing mathematically the impact of the ST\nRTFR controller on the main grid, and in the implementation\nin the real time digital simulator for the PHIL evaluation.\nIn Fig. 5, the contribution of the STs is highlighted in blue.\nThis system is a proof of concept and it is not meant as a\nreal system application. The STs integrated in the distribution\ngrid contribute to system frequency regulation with load power\nmodulation ∆PST , deﬁned by the droop curve of Fig. 4\nand approximated in this analysis by means of linearization\n(neglecting the deadband effect) using a simple constant gain\nKdr. The same gain of the droop characteristic is used for\nthe linearization, with the effect that the following analysis is\nvalid for when the system is outside the deadband area. The\neffect of the deadband on the frequency variation damping is\nnegligible, as it will be shown in the experimental veriﬁcation.\nThe power variation contribution of each single ST is linked\ndirectly to the frequency change (Fig. 4, dashed line), and is\ndeﬁned by the relation\n∆Pi = −Kdr\nf − f0\nf0\n= −Kdr∆ω (4)\nwhere, f and f0 are the measured and nominal system\nfrequency respectively, ∆ω is the per unit frequency variation\nand ∆Pi is per unit power variation referred to nominal\nconsumption of load Li connected to ST i. Assuming that all\nSTs have the same droop, the total power modulation provided\nin response to frequency variation in per unit on total system\nload Lo is:\n∆PST = −\n∑Li\nL0\nKdr∆ω= −KST Kdr∆ω (5)\nwhere:\nKST =\n∑Li\nL0\n(6)\nAs seen above, KST indicates the amount of the power system\nload fed by STs, and it varies between 0 and 1. The remaining\nload (1 − KST )L0 remains synchronously connected, thus\n\n5\nit will respond to frequency variations ∆ω with the self-\nregulation constant D. Referred to the total load L0, this\ncontribution is D(1 − KST ), as seen in Fig. 5.\nTo analyze the RTFR controller contribution, the inner loop\nin Fig. 5 is analyzed, without the effect of the conventional\ngeneration. The close-loop transfer function is deﬁned as:\nE(s) = 1\nMs + D(1 − KST ) + KST Kdr\n= 1\nMs + Deq\n(7)\nwhere\nDeq = D+ KST (Kdr − D) (8)\nAs seen in (7), the ST RTFR controller effectively adds\ndamping to the system. Note that Kdr is larger than D, for\ninstance in Fig. 4, Kdr is 5 pu, whereas self-regulation D is\nclose to 1 pu.\nTo evaluate the effect of the ST-based RTFR control on the\ncomplete control system response, the close loop transfer func-\ntion of the linear power system shown in Fig. 5 is analyzed.\nThe contribution to the equivalent conventional generator is:\nEGen(s) = − 1\nR\n1\n1 + sTG\n1 + sFHP TRH\n(1 + sTCH )(1 + sTRH) (9)\nThe total contribution of generator and ST is then:\nEGen,ST (s) = −KST Kdr + EGen(s) (10)\nand considering the system inertia M and load damping D\ntransfer function:\nI(s) = 1\nMs + D(1 − KST ) (11)\nthe response of the system frequency following an electrical\nload variation is described by the transfer function and the\nroot locus shown in Fig. 6:\n∆ω\n∆Pe\n= I(s)\n1 + I(s)EGen,ST (s) (12)\nIn Fig. 6a, the ST-controlled load share KST is increased\nfrom 0 % to 50 % ( KST =0.5) in steps of 10%, considering\na load damping equal to D=1. In all the aforementioned\nscenarios, a maximum controllable active power of 10 % has\nbeen assumed for each ST. Thus, the maximum load variation\nis 5 % of total system load for the highest considered ST\npenetration. The equivalent damping of the system increases\nfrom Deq=1, in the case without RTFR control to Deq=3.0\nin case of 50 % ST-controlled load. The participation of the\nRTFR controller reduces the frequency oscillations, moving\nthe poles toward the real axis of the root locus In a scenario\nof ST-controlled load of 20 %, the inﬂuence of the variable\nload damping ( D varying within [0 − 2] pu) is described in\nFig. 6b. As can be seen, the equivalent damping Deq varies\nin the range 1-2.8 due to the contribution of RTFR controller.\nThe comparison of the increase of the system inertia M and\ngovernor gain 1/R are shown in Fig. 6c,d, respectively. It\ncan be concluded that the RTFR controller enhances system\ncapacity to handle frequency disturbances, avoiding the need to\nincrease generator support, that may involve new investments.\nTABLE I\nEQUIVALENT SYSTEM PARAMETERS\nParameter Value Parameter Value\nR 0.05 TG 0.2 s\nTCH 0.2 s FHP 0.3\nTRH 7 s M 10 s\nD 1 Kdr 5\nThe step response of the system is depicted in Fig. 7a. Under\na variation of 20 % of electrical load, the system frequency\ngoes below 48.9 Hz. With the implementation of STs in the\ngrid, the frequency variation decreases, and frequency stays\nabove 49.2 Hz in case of 50 % ST-fed grid share. The response\nof the equivalent generator changes also in the presence of ST\ncontrol. The RTFR algorithm supports the generator during the\ntransient, reducing and damping the generator power response\n(Fig. 7b). As a consequence of ST-based RTFR control, less\ngenerator regulation capability is needed in order to suppress\nlarge frequency variations. This represents an important feature\nfor the power grids, mostly in those systems where building\nnew generators or upgrading the old ones represent a chal-\nlenge.\nIn the previous simulation results, a system inertia M=10 s\nwas assumed. However, with the increasing integration of\npower electronics-based generators the inertia can decrease\nconsiderably. The cases with different system inertia are shown\nin Fig. 8.

P OWER HARDWARE IN LOOP EVALUATION\nThe effectiveness of the real time frequency support con-\ntroller has been proved by means of PHIL evaluation, which\nscheme is shown in Fig. 9. The PHIL allows analyzing the\nbehavior of the hardware under test (HuT), i.e. the ST, when\nconnected to a large LV grid, not replicable in lab. In this\nspeciﬁc case, the PHIL is used to investigate the performances\nof the RTFR controller implemented in the ST in real time\nconditions using real measurements from the ST-fed grid. The\nHardware under Test, in this case the ST, controls the voltage\nvL on the ﬁlter capacitor.

Here the voltage is applied directly\nin the ST-fed grid by means of an ideal controlled voltage\nsource. The current demanded by the grid i∗\ng is sampled in\nRTDS and sent to a current controller, that controls the current\ninjection ig of the linear power ampliﬁer in order to reproduce\naccurately the grid current i∗\ng, closing the loop. Between the\nsimulated grid and the ST hardware, a current scale factor\nof 100 pu has been introduced in the current to cope with\nthe limited power capability of the hardware in lab. It means\nthat 1 kW power change in the hardware side corresponds to\n100 kW power change in RSCAD at nominal voltage. The\nPHIL dynamic model has been presented in [32] [33], together\nwith its stability and accuracy analysis.\nTo simulate the transmission grid, a power system equiva-\nlent model is realized in RSCAD. This model emulates the\ngrid transient behavior during disturbances. The ST power\nmeasurement PST comes from the LV grid simulated in\nRSCAD and the machines mechanical power Pm and electrical\npower variation ∆Pe are external set point. The output of the\npower system model is the frequency deviation that is sent to\nthe ST real time frequency support controller.

E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe PHIL evaluation has been performed applying a elec-\ntrical power variation ∆Pe to the equivalent power system in\norder to create under-frequency or over-frequency condition. In\nthis Section the exact nonlinear power/frequency characteristic\nof Fig. 4 is implemented for the ST frequency control. Two\nevents are considered in the PHIL evaluation: an under-\nfrequency case, creates by an increase of the system load\npower request of 20 %; and an over-frequency case, caused\nby a decrease of the system load power equal to 20 %.\nA. Under-frequency event\nTo simulate an under-frequency event, the power system\nelectrical power Pe has been increased with a step of 20 %.\nThis contingency can be the consequence of the loss of a\nbig power plant or the disconnection of an area supplying\nthe transmission system under investigation. From Fig. 11\nplotted in RSCAD, it can be seen that without any control\nthe frequency tends to decrease below 49 Hz.\nIncreasing the presence of ST in the grid ( KST ), two im-\nportant effects can be noticed. Firstly, the transient frequency\ndrop is reduced for increased ST participation. With 20 %\nST presence in the grid, the frequency drop is reduced by\n100 mHz, while for the case of half load controlled by ST\n(50 % case), the frequency drop is reduced by more than\n200 mHz.\n50.2\n50.0\n49.8\n49.6\n49.4\n49.2\n49.0\n48.8\n0 4 8 12 16 20\nHV Frequency (Hz)\nTime (s)\nFig. 11. System frequency during under-frequency condition\nSecondly, the ST power deviation ( ∆PST , Fig. 12) shows\na faster control action than the conventional power system\n(governor and turbine). In Fig. 12, it can be noted how the ST\npresence helps to reduce the mechanical power transient peak\n∆Pm, from 23 % to 20.5 % in case of 20 % ST-fed load, till\nit reaches an over-damped behavior in case of 50 % of ST-\ncontrolled load. Two major effects are achieved: the system\npower oscillations are more damped than the case without any\ncontrol; the STs reduces the generator effort to reestablish a\nconstant frequency value.\nTo depict the operation of the real time frequency controller\nin LV grid, the test case of 20 % ST-fed controlled load has\nbeen chosen. Applying the on-line load sensitivity identiﬁca-\ntion, the grid KP has been found equal to 1.25 pu. During the\npower variation in the power grid, and the following under-\nfrequency conditions, the ST reduces the voltage set-point in\n\n8\n0 4 8 12 16 20\nTime (s)\nElectrical power variation (%)\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\nFig. 12. System power during under-frequency condition\nthe grid up to 0.92 pu (Fig. 13). The grid experiences an under-\nvoltage condition, with the buses farther from the ST slightly\nbelow 0.9 pu. However, this condition is found still acceptable\ndue to the short duration of the under-voltage. The control,\nafter a 20 second transient, restores the voltage nominal value\nin order to not affect the LV grid power quality.\n0 4 8 12 16 20\nTime (s)\n1.02\n1.00\n0.98\n0.96\n0.94\n0.92\n0.90\n0.88\nVoltage (pu)\nFig. 13.

The\nﬁrst graph shows the measured active power in the hardware\nside. In the second graph the LV grid active (black line)\nand reactive (red line) power have been plotted. As can be\nnoticed, there is a factor 100 between the measured power in\nhardware and software side. During the frequency transient,\nthe frequency reaches almost 49 Hz. Following the droop\ncharacteristic in Fig. 4, it corresponds to a power variation of\n10 %. The ST converter in the hardware side, varies the active\npower from 1.05 kW to 0.95 kW during the frequency negative\npeak, as expected from the droop characteristic. Where, the\nLV grid power consumption varies from 105 kW to 95 kW.\nThis demonstrate the accuracy of the on-line load sensitivity\nidentiﬁcation algorithm.\nB. Over-frequency event\nSimilarly to the under-frequency case, the ST is able to\nsupport the transmission grid during over-frequency transients.\n120\n110\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\nST Power (kW,kVAr)\n0 4 8 12 16 20\nTime (s)\n1.20\nST Power (kW)\n1.00\n1.10\n0.90\n0.90\nFig. 14.

In terms of active power contribution ( ∆PST ), the\nST contribution is similar to under-frequency case (Fig. 16).\nIncreasing the presence of ST, the power contribution from\nthe transmission grid generators ∆Pm is more damped.\n0 4 8 12 16 20\nHV Frequency (Hz)\nTime (s)\n51.2\n51.0\n50.8\n50.6\n50.4\n50.2\n50.0\n49.8\nFig. 15. System frequency during over-frequency condition\nA substantial difference with respect to the under-frequency\ncase can be noticed in the proﬁle of the LV-grid voltage\nFig. 17. The maximum voltage deviation in the grid is limited\nto +7 % and it is related to ST bus, while in the under-\nfrequency case (Fig. 13), the voltage deviation reaches −11 %\nin the farther bus in the grid. The reason is the natural\nvoltage drop in the LV grid, due to load absorption. For\nthis reason, the maximum voltage variation in the ST-fed LV\n\n9\n0 4 8 12 16 20\nTime (s)\nElectrical power variation (%)\n0%\n-5%\n-10%\n-15%\n-20%\n-25%\nFig. 16.

The power availability of single ST depends\nalso on the grid composition and power injection of the DG.\nIn case of limited DG power injection, the real time frequency\ncontroller has more capability upwards (over-frequency case)\nthan downwards (under-frequency case), and vice-versa in case\nof high DG power production.\n0 4 8 12 16 20\nTime (s)\n1.08\n1.06\n1.04\n1.02\n1.00\n0.98\n0.96\nVoltage (pu)\nFig. 17.

C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, Smart Transformers are used to control the\nload consumption to provide primary frequency regulation to\nthe transmission grid. By identifying the load sensitivity to\nvoltage variations, the power can be accurately changed during\na frequency transient to increase the equivalent system primary\nfrequency regulation. In this work, it is proved that a 20 %\nof ST-controlled load is sufﬁcient to decrease the transient\nfrequency drop by 100 mHz in the power grid, avoiding to hit\nthe load shedding schemes threshold (set to 49 Hz). Applying\nthe ST-based RTFR control is equivalent to increase the load\ndamping contribution, avoiding to request additional regulation\ncapability from generators. The proposed frequency regulation\nservice respects power quality limits (e.g. voltage variation in\nthe ±10 % range), but it may require some remuneration to\nthe ST-fed loads (e.g., reduced bills).\nREFERENCES\n[1] ”Contribution to Bulk System Control and Stability by Distributed\nEnergy Resources connected at Distribution Network” , IEEE PES\nTechnical Report Std.
