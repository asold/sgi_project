  "abstract": "Purpose of review Last year marked the development of the first foundation model in ophthalmology, RETFound, setting the stage for generalizable medical artificial intelligence (GMAI) that can adapt to novel tasks. Additionally, rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) technology, including models such as GPT-4 and Gemini, have been tailored for medical specialization and evaluated on clinical scenarios with promising results. This review explores the opportunities and challenges for further advancements in these technologies. Recent findings RETFound outperforms traditional deep learning models in specific tasks, even when only fine-tuned on small datasets. Additionally, LMMs like Med-Gemini and Medprompt GPT-4 perform better than out-of-the-box models for ophthalmology tasks. However, there is still a significant deficiency in ophthalmology-specific multimodal models. This gap is primarily due to the substantial computational resources required to train these models and the limitations of high-quality ophthalmology datasets. Summary Overall, foundation models in ophthalmology present promising opportunities but face challenges, particularly the need for high-quality, standardized datasets for training and specialization. Although development has primarily focused on large language and vision models, the greatest opportunities lie in advancing large multimodal models, which can more closely mimic the capabilities of clinicians.",
