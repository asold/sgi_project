Introduction \n \n Due to increasing gasoline prices, environmental concerns and depletion of fossil fuels, \na growing concern for using electric vehicles has emerged. This is while, penetration of large \nresidential loads such as electric vehicles (EVs), is a potential power quality problem. In order \nto suitably prepare for this problem, utilities must be able to predict the EVs battery charging \nloads. Since many distribution systems were designed decades ago considering the load levels \nat that time, major changes might be required in the distribution system components and load \n                                    H.

Unbalanced conditions, reactive power requirements of the charger \nand the distorted currents drawn by the battery chargers are the power quality issues, which \nshould be studied. Harmonics and overloading problems caused by vehicular battery chargers \naffect distribution equipment: transformers, cables, circuit breakers, and fuses [1]. Among \nthese equipments, transformers as the vital and costly elements for pr oper operation of power \ndistribution systems are most important. \n Generally, distribution transformers are designed to supply loads with rated frequency. \nTherefore, much effort has b een devoted for estimation of transformer losses and the required \nderating due to non-sinusoidal currents [2, 3]. A derating technique based on direct measure-\nments performed at fundamental and harmonic frequencies is introduced in [4]. In [5], a finite \nelement method is used for computation of th e losses. A digital data acquisition method for \nmeasuring derating is proposed in [6]. Here, the derating method introduced in [7] will be \nused. \n To carry out studies on electric vehicle batte ry charging load impacts on distribution grid \nequipments, the first step is forecasting the char gers (aggregate) load. Research on this issue \ngoes back to the 1980s, reference [8] gives an  account of some of these studies. In [9] quad-\nratic and dynamic programming is developed to explore household EV charging impacts on \npower losses and voltage deviations in reside ntial distribution systems. Recently, Mullan et \nal., in [10], set out that electricity suppliers can achieve significant benefits if vehicle charging \npatterns are controlled from the outset through structured tariffs. \n Accordingly, there have been few studies about effect of EV battery charging on distribu-\ntion transformers. In [11], authors conclude that there is a quadratic relationship between re-\nduction of the transformer life expectancy and the total harmonic distortion of the battery \ncharger current. They assumed that the statistical distribution of battery chargers currents has \nan exponential increase and decrease, for the fundamental as well as for the odd harmonics. \nThis assumption neglects diversity factors to the current harmonic distribution, while this \nleads to overestimation of the harmonic problem [12]. Masoum et al., in [13], have presented \ntheir study on transformer derating emerged due to PEV penetrations, without considering the \nstochastic nature of the EV charging load. In [12, 14], prediction of the EV charging load and \ntransformer derating procedure are done using a method that neglects the effect of charging \nrates on the start time of EV battery charging loads.  \n In this paper the uncertainties in load diversity duo to charging rate structures will be de-\nliberated while, a model which takes into accoun t the traffic habits, battery charging profile \nand the resultant stochasticity in the charging load will be used. Besides, the test system is \ndivided into different industrial, commercial and residential areas for investigation of residen-\ntial charging in presence of industrial harmonic sources.  \n The rest of the document is organized as fo llows: Section 2 introduces the current electric \nvehicle charging standards and power quality requirements. Section 3 presents the stochastic \nmodel used for EV charging load modeling. Section 4 deals with harmonic spectra of the \nloads. Section 5 discusses the effects of harmonics generated by chargers on transformers and \nformulates this impact. Section 6 presents the test system. Section 7 delivers the simulation \nresults and their discussion. The last section concludes this paper. \nVol. 61(2012)                     Influence of electric vehicle charging rates on transformer 485 \n2. Electric vehicle charging and its standards \n \n In 1991, the Infrastructure Working Council was formed by the Electric Power Research In-\nstitute in the direction of bringing together organizations that are involved in the electric vehicle \nindustry to establish consent items about the methods and requirements of electric vehicle charg-\ning. Three charging levels were defined by the Electric Power Research Institute [15]. \n $ level 1: 120 V, 15 A or 20 A: equipment typically installed on vehicle, \n $ level 2: for both private and public facilities 240 V, 40 A, single phase \n conductive or inductive connection, \n $ level 3: fast charging 480 V, 60-80 A, three phase circuit not considered as a requisite for \nthe establishment of a rich charging infrastructure. \n Besides, society of automotive engineers (SAE) J2894™ document, deals with power \nquality requirements for electric vehicle chargers. This document has three main sections: \nCharger power quality requirements, Characteristics of AC service, and Charging control [16]. \n According to IEEE standard 5 19-1992, for the case of  loads such as EV battery chargers, \ncurrent harmonic limit is 15% for harmonics order lower than 11th – values for other har-\nmonic orders are also documented. Also, the guidelines set by National EV IWC, based upon \nIEC 1000-3-4, recommend a minimum total power factor of 95% and a maximum current \nTHD of 20% [17]. \n Similar to the previous works on this issue massive three-phase PEV charger models – \nwith all batteries connected in parallel, are pr esumed to represent the charging load (Princi-\npally, single phase charging units are more detr imental since they are more available to pro-\nvide easy plug and charge, while they usually use PWM technology which harmonics are rich \nin lots of single phase chargers). Furthermore,  non-linear loads are considered to be current \nsources of different frequencies. \n \n \n \n3. Stochastic modeling of PEV charging loads \n \n Considering that lithium-ion batteries are become more and more popular these days, \na lithium-ion battery which is used in Nissan Altra EVs, is selected for our assessment [18]. \n Figure 1 illustrates the charging cycle for this battery [19]. \n The stochastic model is obtained from [18] , a random variable with probability density \nfunction (pdf) f(t), as the charging start time variable and another random variable with a pro-\nbability density function fE (E), representing the initial state-of-charge SOCi, are defined.  \n \nA) Initial battery state of charge \n The variable Ei, initial battery SOC, has a linear relationship with the distance driven (d); i.e., \n  ,1 ⎟\n⎠\n⎞⎜\n⎝\n⎛ −=\nR\ni\nd\ndE α  (1) \n                                    H.

Charging characteristics of a lithium-ion battery (Nissan Altra) \n \n \nwhere dR is the maximum possible range driven by a fully charged battery and α represents the \nnumber of days the PEV has traveled since last charging. Based on information available on \nprivate vehicle travel, the pdf  for daily distance driven ( d), in miles, is found to be of log-\nnormal type [18]. Consequently, using the fundamental theorem introduced in [20], equation \n(2) will be derived for the pdf of E\ni. \n  ()\n()\n() ( ) ()()\n,10\n21\n1 2\n2\n2\n/ln1ln\n2\n<<\n−\n=\n−−−−\nEe\nE\nEf\nRdE\nE σ\nαμ\nπσ\nβ  (2) \nwhere β is the coefficient used to eliminate the truncation of the pdf, and thus, justifying it as \na density function. This pdf and battery charging profile (Fig. 1) will be used to evaluate the \nprobability of the battery charger power demand. \n \nB) PEV battery charger load demand \n According to the charging profile of a lithium-ion battery a vector ( P) is assigned, in which \neach item at index  j  represents a power demand. Assuming that initial state of charge and \ncharging start time are independent variables, the expected value for the charging load at time \ninstant t for an individual battery will be: \n  () () ,,Φ\n1\n∑\n=\n=\ncn\nj\njj tPPPμ  (3) \nwhere, nc represents the length of the power demand vector for each battery and Ф(Pj, t) is the \nprobability of a charging load with operating power demand Pj at time instant t. Besides, \nФ(Pj, t) can be expressed as: \n  () ()() ( ) ,,Φ\n1\n∑\n=\n−−=\nj\nk\nj kkjtftP H  (4) \nVol. 61(2012)                     Influence of electric vehicle charging rates on transformer 487 \nwhere f(t) is the charging start time function and is defined in the next part for different sce-\nnarios. Furthermore, in Equation (4), H(k) is the probability of charging power P(k). \n Each element of the vector, H, can be evaluated using Equation (2) and the charging pro-\nfile shown in Figure 1. \n Equation (3) will be used to estimate fundam ental current drawn by the chargers, and by \nusing the harmonic spectrum, other harmonic orders currents can be determined. Total load \ndemand at each bus will be μ(P), derived from Equation (3), multiplied by number of vehicles \nat that bus – since similar batteries and battery chargers for all the PEVs are assumed. \n \n1) Charging start time for a fixed electricity rate scenario \n When the charging rate is fixed all day long, the vehicle owners do not have any incentive \nto avoid charging during peak load hours. Therefore, this case might result in a worst case sce-\nnario. Hence, for our test system the charging start time function, f(t), is a partly uniform pdf: \n  () ,241meanyotherti0\n181 ≤≤\n⎩⎨⎧\n=\n== tt\nttf  (5) \ni.e., it is assumed that charging is done at the peak load hours – justifying a worst-case scenario. \n \n2) Charging start time for a TOU charging rate scenario \n In structures that provide en couragement for EV owners to r echarge their vehicles during \noff-peak times, the following uniform discrete distribution can be employed as a representa-\ntive for the possible charging start time pattern. (It is assumed that for the times between \n21 p.m. and 7 a.m. the charging rate is lower than the other daily hours). \n  () .241meanyotherti0\n23,22,2133.0 ≤≤\n⎩⎨\n⎧\n=\n== tt\nttf\n (6) \n \n3) Charging start time for a real time charging rate scenario \n As a general common sense rule, the higher th e price of charge, the fewer the tendencies to \ncharge (at that time) and the higher the traffic at a time, the less the availability of a vehicle to \nbe charged in a station. Therefore by plotting the reciprocal of the product of the curves shown \nin Figure 2(a), an insight to the shape of the distribution of the charging start time can be \ngained. Accordingly, it has been demonstrated in [18] that the distribution of charging start \ntime for this scenario can be a Gaussian distribution due to its bell-shape. \n  ()\n()\n.\n2\n1,,\n2\n2\n2\n2\nσ\nμ\nπσ\nσμ\n−−\n=\nt\netf  (7) \n Figure 2(b) depicts the resultant distribution of charging start time represented by Equa-\ntion (7). \n                                    H.

Harmonic spectra of the loads \n \nA. Non-linear non-EV loads \n An industrial area is included in the test case system which involves using of variable fre-\nquency drives and adjustable speed drives. \n The harmonic current spectra of these VFD an d ASDs [21] are used to model their non-\nlinearity as harmonic current sources – see Table 1. \n \nB. Battery chargers harmonic spectra \n As it is mentioned in [11], although some manufacturers and researchers claim of having \ndesigns with extremely low THD, but commercial chargers with THD values as high as 60% \ncould be found. Therefore, no general agreement exists among the THD values generated by \ndifferent battery chargers. Accordingly, some re searchers consider the charger as highly con-\ntaminating load, with suggested average THD value of about 30%. Staats et al., [12] perfor-\nVol. 61(2012)                     Influence of electric vehicle charging rates on transformer 489 \nmed an elaborate statistical study based on Monte Carlo simulations that investigate uncer-\ntainties in load diversity due to different start times, variable initial battery state-of-charge and \ndifferent charging profiles. Typical harmonic current content of PEV chargers obtained from \n[12] is shown in Table 2. \n \nTable 1.

Furthermore, similar to our \nmodeling for other non-linear loads, current sources with the aforementioned harmonic spectra \nwill represent the non-linearity of the charging load in our harmonic load flow. As additional \npoints, it should be mentioned that differences in the phase angle of current harmonics result \nin phase cancellation phenomena. Furthermore, when considering the impact of harmonic cur-\nrents on transformer deration, the THD is a mi sleading factor, since the magnitude at each or-\nder of harmonic current, is more important when thermal effects are concerned. Also, due to \n                                    H. Jouybari-Moghaddam, A. Alimardani, S.H. Hosseinian                Arch. Elect. Eng. 490 \nunavailability of the required data, in our study, the harmonic content of the charger (in per-\ncentage of the fundamenta l current) is assumed to be constant during the whole charging pe-\nriod but in fact, as the fundamental frequency current drawn by the charger changes during the \ncharge cycle, there is no significant change in harmonic current magnitudes. \n \n \n5. Effect of EV charging on transformers \n \n Higher heating by fundamental current and additional heat by harmonics (due to losses) \nare effects of battery charging load on transformer. The non-uniform current distribution in the \nwindings (skin and proximity effects) and st ray losses from electromagnetic flux in areas \nwhere it was not intended, result in extra losses [11]. Thus, life span reduction by higher hot-\nspot temperature is introduced. The decrease in  the life span can be mitigated by appropriate \nload reduction, known as required transformer derating. The IEEE standard C57.110 standar-\ndizes this transformer life reduction or the derating factor. Making use of the winding eddy-\ncurrent loss, harmonic current magnitudes, and harmonic order values the derating factor can \nbe evaluated. In general a transformer in wh ich the current distortio n exceeds 5% is usually \nconsidered for derating for harmonics [17]. \n \nA) Dry-type transformer capability equivalent calculation using design eddy-current loss \ndata \n Conventionally, a single number to determine the capabilities of a transformer in supplying \npower to a load is defined. The term F\nHL is a proportionality factor applied to the winding \neddy losses. It represents the effective rms heating caused by the harmonic load current. Equa-\ntion (8) formulates this term, in which PEC  is the total winding eddy current losses due to the \nharmonics, and PEC-o is the winding eddy current losses at the power frequency, when no \nharmonic currents exist. Equation (9) defines the K-factor which can be obtained from FHL in \nEquation (8). A higher K-factor indicates that th e eddy current loss in the transformer will be \nK times the value at the fundamental frequency. \n  ,\nmax\nmax\n1\n2\n1\n22\n∑\n∑\n=\n=\n−\n==\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nOEC\nEC\nHL\nI\nhI\nP\nPF  (8) \n  \n()\n.factor 2\n1\n1\n2\nmax\nrms\nh\nh\nh\nHL\nI\nI\nFK\n∑\n==−  (9) \n In order to maintain normal life of the tr ansformer, IEEE std C57.110 recommends that the \ntransformer loaded under non-sinusoidal conditions, shouldn't be loaded at its rated capacity. \nVol. 61(2012)                     Influence of electric vehicle charging rates on transformer 491 \nEquation (10) derives the factor that must be multiplied by the rated current for determination \nof the recommended maximum load current that can be continuously drawn from the trans-\nformer under standard conditions (the maximu m permissible rms non-sinusoidal load current \nunder rated conditions) [7]. \n  .p.u1\n.p.u1.p.umax\nRECHL\nREC\nPF\nPI\n−\n−\n×+\n+= .

Note  that for the transformers in the test sy-\nstem, the average winding eddy-cu rrent loss under rated conditions, PEC-R, at the point of \nmaximum loss density is assumed to be 8% of the local RI2  loss [17]. \n \n \n6. System under study \n \n An 11-kV 38-bus system, Figure 4(a), with base power of 1 MVA is selected as the case \nstudy system. It is assumed that laterals 2-19, 3-23, 7-8, 6-26 supply commercial loads, indu-\nstrial loads, composite loads and residential load s, respectively. The daily  load curves for the \naforementioned load types are depicted in Figure 4(b), where the load curve for composite loads \nis assumed to be the mean of the three other curves. With reference to Table 1, for industrial \nloads a VFD is placed at bus 23, and two ASDs at  buses 24 and 25. For the parameters of the \nsystem and the loads (excluding the battery charging loads) refer to [18].  \n \n \nFig. 4. Test system, schematic (a), test system, (b) daily load curves \n                                    H. Jouybari-Moghaddam, A. Alimardani, S.H. Hosseinian                Arch. Elect. Eng. 492 \n The number of vehicles is considered to be 2840 with a penetration level of 20%, i.e. the \ncharging PEVs percentage of the total number of vehicles. Besides, all of the charging cars are \nassumed to be charged at the residential area and are spread evenly between the residential \nbuses. Note that the daily load curves, charging rates, traffic pattern and the number of \nvehicles are all selected from [18] and none of the system constraints (bus voltages and line \nlimits) have been violated. \n \n \n \n7. Simulation results and discussion \n \n A backward/forward sweep-based  harmonic load flow using the method presented in [22] \nwas developed in MATLAB for a symmetrical th ree phase harmonic analysis for distribution \nsystems. \n Our study will be focused on the impact of non-sinusoidal PEV charging load on trans-\nformer standard loading, using the stochastic model developed in section 3-B. Note that in \nreality most of the EV charging is done at residential areas, therefore the charging is presumed \nto be done at this area. Besides, it is taken fo r granted that a distribution transformer supplies \nthe residential area. Therefore we will use the harmonic dist ribution of the corresponding cur-\nrents drawn from the residential transformer, to illustrate our points. Figures 5-7 depict the \nchanges in the K-factor, total harmonic distor tion and the recommended derating of the trans-\nformer current for the fixed charging rate (worst  case scenario), respectively. Similarly, Figu-\nres 8-10 and 11-13 illustrate the previous poin ts for the TOU and real time rate (RTR) sce-\nnarios, respectively. In these figures the filled bars represent the case where the charging load \ngenerates harmonics and the non-filled bars stand for the case assuming that the charger cur-\nrents are free of harmonics (i.e. only background harmonics from industrial area are present). \n As can be seen from Figures 5-7, by introdu cing the nonlinear chargi ng load a noticeable \nrise will occur in the transforme r K-factor and current THD, resulting in a negative effect on \nthe transformer life. This effect  may become devastating when higher penetration of EVs is \nconsidered. \n \n \nFig. 5.

Daily residential transformer current THD, fixed rate scenario \n \n \nFig. 7. Residential transformer recommended derating in percentage of the rated load capability, fixed \nrate scenario \n \n For the TOU charging rate scenario, Figures 8-10 show that although the resultant current \nTHD is less than the fixed rate scenario but still derating should be performed for utilization of \nthe transformer life span. The improvements are due to the direct impact of charging start time \npattern on the expected value for the charging load \n:(P), which is, in equation form, the \ninfluence of substitution of Equation (4) in (3). \n \n \nFig. 8.

A cur-\nrent THD of less than 5% and K-factors near to on e, ensure that there is no need to derate the \ntransformer. Again the influence of charging start time distribution on :(P) can be seen in the \nfigures. In fact, in this scenario :(P) has been spread over the da y in a more even way, result-\ning in an acceptable transformer operation during the whole 24 hour time interval. The merits \nof this refinement will become more tangible when a higher penetration of plug-in electric \nvehicles exists.  \n \nFig. 11.

Conclusion \n \n The simulation developed in this study, investigates statistical modeling of plug-in electric \nvehicles charging load in order to assess its impact on transformer life, in a realistic way. \nSince the model includes battery charging star t time variable, three corresponding charging \nrate scenarios were considered to evaluate ho w they might affect transformer current distor-\ntion and its k-factor derating. Results showed a maximum of 1.25, 13.25% and 4.34% rise in \nthe K-factor, THD and derating, respectively, for the worst case scenario of fixed charging \nrate. Besides, simulations demonstrated that applying real time rate billing is the most promis-\ning scenario by which the distribution system operator could ensure operation with least stress \non the supplying transformer due to spreading of  the expected charging load during the day. \nTherefore, as we know that derating has some disadvantages (such as low efficiency, possible \nlong-term maintenance problem (overload) and over-current protection false tripping), instead \nof derating or using expensive k-rated transformers (that are designed to handle the heat gene-\nrated by harmonic currents while keeping the losses low), deploying real-time charging rate \nfor vehicle charging statio ns can preferably prevent transfor mer failure even in case of high \npenetration of harmonic-rich EV charging loads.  \n                                    H.

In fact its discussion was from the distribution system \noperator point of view. With the development of  smart programmable chargers researches on \nalgorithms that take into account both EV owners and system operator points of view (includ-\ning optimum charging cost and various network operating issues such as the explained trans-\nformer derating) are getting attention.    \n \n \n \nReferences \n [1] Onar O.C., Khaligh A., Grid Interactions and Stability Analysis of Distribution Power Network with \nHigh Penetration of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles .
