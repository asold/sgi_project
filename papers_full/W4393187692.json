  "abstract": "Diseases of tomato leaves can seriously damage crop yield and financial rewards. The timely and accurate detection of tomato diseases is a major challenge in agriculture. Hence, the early and accurate diagnosis of tomato diseases is crucial. The emergence of deep learning has dramatically helped in plant disease detection. However, the accuracy of deep learning models largely depends on the quantity and quality of training data. To solve the inter-class imbalance problem and improve the generalization ability of the classification model, this paper proposes a cycle-consistent generative-adversarial-network-based Transformer model to generate diseased tomato leaf images for data augmentation. In addition, this paper uses a Transformer model and densely connected CNN architecture to extract multilevel local features. The Transformer module is utilized to capture global dependencies and contextual information accurately to expand the sensory field of the model. Experiments show that the proposed model achieved 99.45% accuracy on the PlantVillage dataset. The 2018 Artificial Intelligence Challenger dataset and the private dataset attained accuracies of 98.30% and 95.4%, and the proposed classification model achieved a higher accuracy and smaller model size compared to previous deep learning models. The classification model is generalizable and robust and can provide a stable theoretical framework for crop disease prevention and control.",
