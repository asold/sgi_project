INTRODUCTION \nower transformers are vital links and one of the most \ncritical and expensive assets in electrical power systems.  \nThe majority of in -service power transformers have already \nexceeded their expected rated life as they were mostly installed \nprior to 1980 [1]. This poses a significant risk for utilities as \nimpacts of in -service transformer failures can be catastrophic. \nFurthermore, the day -by-day increase in load demand, global \ntrend to develop  smart grids and the growing number  of \nnonlinear loads such as smart appliances and electric vehicles \nwill further increase  the likelihood of non -sinusoidal \ntransformer operation and failures. Therefore, it is essential to \nadopt simple, reliable and accurate diagnostic tools to \ndetermine the current state, detect incipient faults and estimate \nremaining life of the existing in -service power transformers in \norder to prevent failures, decrease maintenance cost and \nimprove reliability of the power systems  [2-4]. Conventional \ntransformer windings are made of copper strands covered with \npaper or continuously transposed coated copper strands with an \noverall paper covering, while more recent technologies use soft \nor hard pressboard for interlayer, inter-turn, end insulation and \nwinding cylinders [5]. Aging of transformer paper and \npressboard which is a function of temperature, moisture and \noxygen will reduce the dielectric strength of the insulation due \nto the pr esence of contaminants including oxidation products \nfrom oil and moisture. This will reduce insulation tensile \nA.S. Masoum is a Graduate Electrical Engineer at Western Power, Perth WA, \nAustralia. N. Hashemnia , A. Abu -Siada, M.A.S. Masoum and S. Islam are \nwith Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, \nWA, Australia. Emails:  ali.sherkatmasoum@postgrad.curtin.edu.au , naser. \nhashemnia@postgrad.curtin.edu.au, a.abuSiada@curtin.edu.au, m.masoum@ \ncurtin.edu.au, s.islam@curtin.edu.au.  \n \nstrength and eventually results in losing clamping pressure \nleading to winding deformation. Furthermore, due to thermal \nstress that in-service transformer exhibits and because of short \ncircuit faults, oil and paper decomposition takes place evolving \nsubsequent gases that dissolve in oil, reduce its dielectric \nstrength and may lead to partial discharge or sustained arcing if \na proper corrective acti on is not taken  [6]. Although a \ntransformer with minor winding deformation can continue to \nwork normally, its capability to withstand further faults is \nsignificantly reduced. Therefore, it is vital to continuously \nmonitor and quickly detect winding deformation as it is one of \nthe first and fundamental precursors to a decline in transformer \ncondition. Physical inspection of core and winding \ndeformation is not recommended since it requires removal of \noil and exposure of insulation to air which increases the \ntransformer failure risk. The most common and widely \naccepted approach to detect transformer winding deformations, \ncore and clamping structure is the frequency response analysis \n(FRA) [7]. FRA is an offline test based on the measurement of \nthe impedance, admittance or transfer function of a particular \nphase as a function of a wide frequency range which is used as \na transformer fingerprint that can be compared with its \nprevious signatures to detect any winding displacements [8]. \nAlthough FRA is a powerful diagnostic tool for detecting \nwinding deformation, its offline nature and reliance on \ngraphical analysis are considered as the main drawbacks [9]. A\n \npractical and simple online transformer internal fault detection \ntechnique has recently been proposed [6, 10]. This online \ntechnique is  based on considering the correlation of the \ntransformer input and output ins tantaneous voltage difference \n(∆V= v 1(t)-v2(t)) and input current (I= i(t) ) as a transformer \nfingerprint that could be measured every cycle at the network \npower frequency and compared with the previous locus to \nidentify any incipient changes within the internal mechanical \nstructure of the transformer. While this online approach is \nimmature and its performance and accuracy have not been \nthoroughly validated, it looks very promising and deserves \nfurther research and investigation. In this paper , a detailed \nthree-dimensional finite element transformer model is \ndeveloped to val idate the performance of the proposed ∆V-I \nfault detection on line technique [6] and also to investigate its \nperformance under non-sinusoidal operating conditions . As it \nis difficult to implement faults on practical transformer without \nharming it, a transformer nonlinear finite -element model is \nused to readily emulate various transformer internal physical \nfaults. Power transformer is simulated for (non)sinusoidal \noperations subjected to four types of internal faults and the \ncorresponding ∆V -I loci are generated. Simulation s and \nlaboratory measurements are used to validate the on line \ndetection approach by investigating  the impacts of various \nfault types and levels, as well as harmonic orders and \nmagnitudes on the ∆V -I locus.  Simulations are performed  \nusing Simplorer and Maxwell finite element software packages \n[11]. \n \nOnline Transformer Internal Fault Detection Based on Instantaneous \nV oltage and Current Measurements Considering Impact of Harmonics  \nAli S.

ONLINE INTERNAL FAULT DETECTION TECHNIQUE \nCONSIDERING HARMONICS   \nThe online internal fault detection technique presented in [6] is \nbased on the construction of a locus diagram relating a \ntransformer input current on the x -axis and the difference \nbetween the input and output voltages on the y -axis. The \nrelationship relating th e above parameters in the presence of \nharmonics can be derived based on  the single-phase \ntransformer equivalent circuit of Fig. 1 using superposition. \n1hLjω 2hLjω\nmLjω)t(v1\n1R 2R\ncR\n)t(i1\n)t(e\n)t(ie\n)t(ic)t(im\n)t(v2\n(non)sinusoidal \nutility voltage\n)t(i2\n(non)linear \nloadLZ\n \nFig. 1.

Transformer ∆V-I Locus for Non-Sinusoidal Operation \nAssuming a linear transformer model (Fig. 1), the concept of \nsuperposition can be applied to Eqs. 1 and 2. Therefore, the \nCartesian relation for a non-sinusoidal  transformer excitation \nwith fundamental and h th harmonic components will be the \nsuperposition of two ellipse s (∆V(1+h)-I(1+h)). The ellipses will \nhave different radiuses on the x and y axis as most standards \nlimit the harmonic voltage distortion to five percent  of the \nfundamental component. Fig. 2(b) illustrates formation of the \ndistorted ellipse locus with minor loops. The shape, magnitude \nand number of minor loops depend on the harmonic order, \nmagnitude and phase.     \nD. Graphical Representation of Fault Detection Approach \nThe on line fault detection approach is graphically \ndemonstrated in Fig. 2 (a) for sinusoidal excitation with  a \nlagging power factor (PF) of 0.8 where the instantaneous \nvalues of y=∆V(1) and x=I(1) are measured at a particular time \nto calculate the corresponding point on the ∆V(1)-I(1)\n locus (Eq. \n1). The phase shift between primary and secondary voltages \nδ(1) is relatively small and its impact on the proposed locus is \ninsignificant and can be neglected [6]. Furthermore, the phase \nshift φ(1) between primary current and secondary voltage is \nalmost equal to the load impedance phase angle since phase \nshift between primary and secondary currents is negligible [6]. \nt\nmeasured instantaneous \ntransformer input and \noutput voltage difference \nmeasured instantaneous \ntransformer input current \non-line \ngenerated \nΔV-I locus  \nt\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1 2\n3 3\n3\n4\n4\n4\nI =1 i (t)\nΔV\nI\nΔV = 1 v (t) – v (t)2\n \n(a) \nt\nmeasured instantaneous \ntransformer input and \noutput voltage difference \nmeasured instantaneous \ntransformer input current \non-line \ngenerated \nΔV-I locus  \nt\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1 2\n3 3\n3\n4\n4\n4\nΔV = 1 v (t) – v (t)2\nI =1 i (t)\nΔV\nI\n \n(b) \nt\nmeasured instantaneous \ntransformer input and \noutput voltage difference \nmeasured instantaneous \ntransformer input current \non-line \ngenerated \nΔV-I locus\n  \n2\n1\n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\n4\nΔV = 1 v (t) – v (t)2\nI =1 i (t)\nt\n4\n2\n3\nI\n1\nΔV\n \n(c) \nFig. 2.

In these cases, the \nshapes of locus are distorted ellipse with peaky and flat minor \nloops (Eq. 2). It is worth mentioning  that the ΔV-I locus \nis generated by plotting the instantaneous values \nof Δv(t)=v1(t)-v2(t) versus the instantaneous values of i1(t) at \na particular time  step. Therefore, the extreme limits of both I \n(x axis) and ΔV (y axis) swap between their corresponding \nmaximum positive and minimum negative limits as illustrated \nin Fig. 2. \nIII.  TRANSFORMER MAGNETIC AND ELECTRIC MODELS  \nThe conventional transformer equivalent distributed -\nparameters electrical model [8] is shown in Fig. 3(a). For the \nanalyses and simulations  of this paper, the detailed three-\ndimensional finite -element nonlinear model comprising \ntransformer magnetic and electric components of a single-\nphase, shell -type transformer as shown in Fig. 3 (b) is \ndeveloped using the Maxwell/Simplorer finite element \nsoftware [11] based on the transformer physical dimensions as \ngiven in the Appendix . The transformer equivalent electrical \ncircuit parameters including self/mutual inductance, resistance \nand capacitance are obtained by solving the three-dimensional \ntransformer model in magneto-static and electr o-static solvers \nusing Maxwell’s equations as will be briefly elaborated below.   \nCsRp\nRs Cg/2\nLs\nCw/2\nCHL\nG GHL\nCs Rp\nG\nRs \nCg\nG G\nLs\nGHL\nCg\nCg/2\nMij\nMi’j’\nMij’\nRi\nRo\nVin\nLV Winding HV Winding \nVout\n \n(a) \n)t(v1\n(non)sinusoidal \nutility voltage\n(non)linear \nload\nnonlinear three-dimensional finite-element\n transformer magnetic core model\n)t(i1\n)t(v2\n)t(i2\nLZ\nHV windings LV windings\n(b) \nFig. 3.

Winding Short Circuit Fault Considering Harmonics \nStudies show that about 80% of transformer breakdown are \nattributed to mechanical deformations [16-18] due to the short \ncircuit faults. In the model under study, different number of \nwindings has been short circuited and the ∆V-I locus is plotted \nand compar ed with the healthy locus as shown in Fig. 6. \nAccording to Fig. 6(a), winding short circuit faults rotates the \n∆V-I\n locus in clockwise direction with respect to the reference \nlocus while a substantial increase in the entire area of the \nellipse can be obser ved. The ellipse angle of rotation and its \nentire area increases with the increase of fault level.  This is \nattributed to the fact that the entire transformer impedance is \ndecreased when a winding short circuit takes place and, for the \nsame input voltage (Fig. 6(a)), the input current increases.  \nFigs. 6(b)-(e) compare the ∆V -I locus of healthy and faulty \ntransformer with 5% and 10% short -circuited coils for non -\nsinusoidal excitation with 10% of 3 rd, 5th and 7 th voltage \nharmonics at phase angles of 0 o and 180o. According to these \nfigures, similar impact on the locus area and ellipse major axis \nrotation as in sinusoidal excitation can be noticed . However, \nthe ellipse shape of the locus is distorted with minor peaky and \nflat loops depending on the order,  magnitude and phase angle \nof the harmonics.   \nB.  Axial Displacement Fault Considering Harmonics \nThis fault occurs due to the magnetic imbalance between the \nlow and high voltage windings as a result of short circuit \ncurrents [19]. The axial displacement between the magnetic \ncenters of the windings results in unbalanced magnetic force \ncomponents in each half of the winding which leads to a \nchange in its relative position [6]. This causes the impacted \nwinding to shift axially with respect to the other winding. \n \nAxial forces lead to tilting or bending of conductors and are \nknown to be more destructive when the windings are not \nplaced symmetrically [20]. Titling and bending of conductors \nbetween spacers are the most common reported deformations \ndue to axial forces [21]. Furthermore, any small displacement \nduring transformer transportation or due to earthquake would \nresult in intensified axial forces when short circuit occurs [22]. \nAxial force due to the axial leakage flux at the gap between \nthe two windings is calculated as [24]: \n7\neff\nm2\nmaxaxial 10D)NI(a2F −×\n\n\n\n\n ππ= \n                             (11) \nwhere a, N, I max, D m and ℓ eff are fractional difference in \nwinding heights, maximum current, mean diameter of the \ntransformer limb (mm) and effective length of the path of the \nradial flux, respectively. \nIn the transformer model under study, axial fault is simulated \nby shifting the HV winding axially as shown in Fig. 5(a) [23]. \nFig. 7 shows impact of two axial fault levels on the ∆V -I \nlocus. As shown in Fig. 7(a), axial displacement slightly \ndecreases the entire area of the locus while no rotation of the \nlocus major axis is observed. Th is is attributed to the fact that \naxial displacement will slightly change the mutual inductance \nbetween the faulted winding and the adjacent winding. \nAccording to Figs. 7(b) -(e), similar comments apply for non -\n \n \n0885-8977 (c) 2013 IEEE.

Radial Displacement Fault Considering Harmonics \nInteraction of leakage flux and windings current can cause \nradial electromagnetic forces that may cause the conductors to \nbend in each span or in alternate spans between the axial \nsupporting strips  [25]. Radial forces produced by the axial \nleakage field acting outwards on the outer winding can stretch \nthe conductors, cause hoop stress and at the same time  lead \ninner winding to experience radial compressive stress  [25]. \nRadial force due to the axial leakag e flux at the gap between \nthe two windings is calculated as [18,26]: \n( )NI2H2\nNI2DF\nw\n0\naveradial \n\n\n\n\n µπ=                                   (12) \nwhere Hw, D ave, N, I and µ 0 are respectively winding height, \naverage winding diameter, number of turns, RMS winding’s \n \n \n0885-8977 (c) 2013 IEEE.

This force pulls the inner \nwinding close to the core (buckling stress) while pushing the \nouter winding toward the limb (tensile stress)  [27]. Various \ntypes of deformations due to radial forces have been discussed \nin the literature  [28]. The most common classes of \ndeformation are the free and forced buckling types.  Radial \nfault may influence the entire windings or only a portion of the \nwindings.  \nFig. 8 shows the impact of radial movement of the HV disks \nas shown in Fig. 5(b) on the ∆V -I locus. According to Fig. \n8(a), radial fault slightly decreases the locus area and rotates \nellipse major axis clockwise direction. The impact is more \npronounced as the fault level increases.

Disk Space Variation Fault Considering Harmonics \nOne of the frequently occurring mechanical faults in power \ntransformers is the disk space variation [29-30] which changes \nthe geometry of transformer windings as shown in Fig. 5(c).  \nFig. 9 shows the impact of disk space variation fault on the  \n∆V-I locus with sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal excitations. \n \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \n \n(c) \n \n(d) \n \n(e)  \nFig. 9.

Similar to short circuit, axial \nand radial faults, non -sinusoidal excitation of the transformer \nsubject to disk space variation will also introduce minor loops \nin the ∆V-I locus (Figs. 9(b)-(e)). \n \nE.  Core Deformation Fault Considering Harmonics \nCore deformation failures result in variations of the core’s \nmagnetic circuit (Fig. 5(d)). Core defects include shorted core \nlaminations, burnt core laminations, multiple/unintentional \ncore grounds, joint dislocations and lost core ground  [31-33]. \nIn addition, there are s ome core defects as a result of  poor \ninsulation of the core tightening screws or an obstructed oil \ncooling duct that cause s excessive heat to the core. A poor or \nloose tightening between the core and the clamps of the \nwindings can also cause damaging vibra tions [31-33]. Fig. 10 \nshows the impact of core  outer limbs deformation (as shown \nin Fig. 5(d)) on the ∆V-I locus with sinusoidal excitation. Fig. \n10 shows that core deformation has a slight impact on the ∆V-\nI locus as it slightly increases its perimeter without introducing \nany rotation to the ellipse major axis. This slight impact is \nattributed to the fact that deformation of the outer limbs will \naffect the flux distribution in the vicinity of the transformer \nwinding that in turns slightly changes the inductance of the \nwindings.  \n \nFig. 10. Impact of core deformation fault (Fig. 5(d)) on the online ∆V -I locus \nwith sinusoidal excitation. \nF.  Impact of Load Level and Power Factor on ΔV-I Locus \nAccording to [6], load level and PF have minor impacts on the \nproposed ∆V-I locus. To further investigate these impacts, \nsimulations are performed and presented in Fig. 11 for \nresistive, series RL and parallel RC loads.  As expected and \nreported in [6], loa d level and PF don’t have significant \nimpacts on the ellipse shape of the ∆V-I locus and will slightly \nchange its area.      \nV.  ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF RESULTS  \nTable I compares and summaries the impacts of the \ninvestigated internal winding faults (short c ircuit, axial, radial \nand disk space variation) on ∆V -I locus area and major axis \nrotation based on the detailed simulation results of Figs. 6 -9. \nEllipse entire area and the angle of ellipse major axis with the \nx-axis have been calculated using an image pr ocessing-based \nMatlab code. The observations below can be drawn:  \n• Table I (rows 3 -4, 13-14, 19- 20, 25-26) confirms the \npreviously reported [6, 18] impacts of internal winding \nfaults for sinusoidal operation. However, results are more \naccurate as these references have used a distributed linear \nmodel to simulate faults by modifying circuit parameters \nwhile this paper utilizes an accurate nonlinear finite -\nelement transformer model to precisely simulate each fault.      \n(a)  \n              \n(b)  \nFig. 11. Impacts of load type, level and PF on ∆V -I locus; (a) resistive loads, \n(b) inductive and capacitive loads.  \n \n• All observations about impacts of various faults on ellipse \nshape ∆V-I locus generally hold in presence of harmonics \nwith the exception of the formation of minor loops. \n• Harmonics and non-sinusoidal transformer excitations will \ninfluence the online fault detection approach by introducing \nminor loops in the ellipse ∆V -I locus. The numbers, \nmagnitudes and type (peaky, flat) of the minor loops \ndepend on the orders, magnitudes and phase angles of the \nvoltage harmonics. \n• According to Fig. 6 and Table I (rows 3-12), winding short \ncircuit faults with (non)sinusoidal excitation result in \nclockwise rotation of the ∆V -I locus while substantially \nincreasing its entire area. This is attributed to the  fact that \nthe entire transformer impedance is  decreased when a \nwinding short circuit takes place and as a result, for the \nsame input voltage, the input current increases.   \n• According to Fig. 7 and Table I (rows 13-18), axial \ndisplacement faults with (non) sinusoidal transformer \nexcitation slightly decrease ∆V-I locus area with no rotation \nof the major axis.  This is expected as axial displacement  \nslightly changes mutual inductance with respect to adjacent \nwindings. This mutual inductance is usually smaller than \nwinding self-inductance and its variations can be neglected. \n• According to Fig. 8 and Table I (rows 19-24), radial  faults \nwith sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal transformer excitations \ndecrease the locus area while slightly rotating the major \naxis. The sli ght locus rotation discriminates this type of \nfault from the winding axial fault. \n• According to Fig. 9 and Table I (rows 25-30), disk space \nvariations faults under sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal \noperating conditions significantly rotates the ∆V -I locus in \nclockwise direction while increasing its entire area.   \n \n \n0885-8977 (c) 2013 IEEE.

It is worth mentioning that the transformer  \nprotection schemes such as differential protection relays are \nnot capable of detecting transformer internal faults . \nDifferential relays have rapid response and are effective in \nisolating power transformers during transformer faults \nhowever, they are greatly desensit ized so that they do not \nfalsely trigger due to circuit breaker actions, capacitor bank \nswitching, and transformer tap changing , as well as during \nenergizing period of the transformer. This means that for a \nminor winding deformation, the differential relay  would not \npotentially operate. The new online ∆V -I fault detection \napproach is meant to detect incipient winding deformation and \nit does not necessarily have to be used to trip the transformer. \nThe proposed technique can be used as a flagship to alarm the  \ncontrol center that something is being wrong within the \ntransformer winding mechanical structure so that an \nappropriate remedial action or further investigation can be \nmade on a proper time to avoid catastrophic failures.  \n \n \n0885-8977 (c) 2013 IEEE.

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF ∆V-I LOCUS FOR SHORT \nCIRCUIT FAULT AND (NON)SINUSOIDAL EXCITATION \nFurther investigations of the online fault detection approach \nbased on ∆V -I locus  were carried out through experimental \nlaboratory tests for the setup shown in Fig. 12 under sinusoidal \nand non-sinusoidal transformer excitations (Fig. 13).  \nThe d etailed technical setup shown in Fig. 12(b) consists of \ntransformer, digital oscilloscope, power source , computer, \nFluke digital multimeter, load and current sense resistor.

CONCLUSION \nThis paper presents detailed finite -element based simulations \nand analysis to evaluate the performance of an online internal \ntransformer fault detection approach for sinusoidal and non -\nsinusoidal operating conditions. Based on extensive  \nsimulations and analyses for short circuit, axial, radial and \ndisk space variation faults, as well as laboratory measurements \nfor winding short circuit faults, the main conclusions are: \n• Under sinusoidal operating conditions, the ∆V-I locus of the \nhealthy/faulty transformer is an ellipse. Harmonics distort \nthe shape of locus by introducing minor loo ps. The shape, \nmagnitude and number of minor loops depend on the order, \npercentage and phase angle of harmonics.  \n• For sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal operating conditions, t he \n∆V-I locus of health y transformer can be used as the \nfingerprint and can be continuously compared with the \nonline measured locus to detect internal faults. \n• Each fault impacts the ∆V-I locus shape, area and major axis \nrotation in a unique way with a certain degree of change that \ndepends on the fault type and level, as well as harmo nic \norder, magnitude and phase angle. \n• In contrast to conventional off-line sweep frequency \nresponse techniques, the ∆V -I locus is conducted at the \npower frequency, does not require taking the transformer out \nof service and hence continuous online evaluatio ns of \ntransformer winding mechanical integrity can be realised. \n• The online ∆V -I locus can identify and qualify transformer \ninternal faults under (non) sinusoidal operating conditio ns. \nHowever, its application to practical three-phase power \ntransformers has not been explored and requires more \nresearch. \n• Impacts of nonlinear loads on the ∆V-I locus of transformer \nwith (non)sinisoidal excitation depend  on characteristics of \nthe injected input voltage and output current harmonics at its \nterminals which are not investigated in this paper. \nA\nPPENDIX \nTABLE A: DETAILS OF THE FINITE ELEMENT TRANSFORMER MODEL. \nSIMULATED TRANSFORMER PARAMETERS \nS / f Rated pow / frequency 5 kVA, 50 Hz \nVH / VL Rated HV / LV voltage 22kV / 11kV \nNP / NS Primary/secondary windings 510 / 260 \nDP / DS Primary/secondary disks 200 / 100 \nTRANSFORMER DIMENSIONS  \nRegion Loss density \n[W/m3] \nDimensions [mm] \nHeight Inner Outer \nCore Window 12800.12 1700  -- \nHV Winding 36812.58 1700 722 835 \nLV Winding 71510.13 1650 462 532 \nREFERENCES \n[1] \"IEEE Guide for the Application and Interpretation of Frequency \nResponse Analysis for Oil -Immersed Transformers,\" IEEE Std C57.149-\n2012, pp. 1-72, 2013. \n[2] A.
