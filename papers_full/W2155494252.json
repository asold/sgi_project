The Institute of Medicine report \nT o Err Is Human highlighted the importance of safety culture by \nstating that “health care organizations must develop a culture of \nsafety such that an organization’s care processes and workforce \nare focused on improving the reliability and safety of care for \npatients” (2000: 14). Pronovost and Sexton (2005) suggest that \nhaving a culture that promotes safety within your organiza -\ntion is an important and necessary precursor to improving the \ninsufficiencies in patient safety. In January 2005, the Canadian \nCouncil on Health Services Accreditation (CCHSA) formally \nrecognized the importance of culture in healthcare standards \nby including a culture of safety as one of their patient safety \ngoals and also specifying five required organizational practices \nto promote a positive culture. The emphasis on creating the \nright culture to support patient safety is recognition that a poor \nculture is a significant risk factor that can threaten patient \nsafety (Nieva and Sorra 2003) and that until the culture within \nhealthcare changes, nothing else will (Vincent 2005). There are \ntwo fundamental assumptions underlying much of the safety \nculture research: (1) a positive safety culture is associated with \nimproved safety performance (Clarke 1999) and (2) it is possible \nto improve the culture of an organization (Guldenmund 2000). \nYet, there is a lack of empirical data on what a good culture looks \nlike (Cox and Cox 1996) and how to develop a good safety \nculture (Parker et al. 2006).\nCurrently, patient safety culture is commonly assessed via \nself-completion questionnaires. This process typically involves \nmailing questionnaires to all staff and collating and calculating \nmean responses to items or factors (see Fleming and Hartnell \n2007). Safety culture surveys provide much information about \nemployee attitudes, but it is difficult to use the results to identify \npractical actions to improve the culture. In fact, safety culture \nPatient Safety Culture  \nImprovement Tool: Development \nand Guidelines for Use\nMark Fleming and Natasha Wentzell\nAbstract\nThe Patient Safety Culture Improvement Tool (PSCIT) \nwas developed to assist healthcare organizations in \nidentifying practical actions to improve their culture. \nThis article describes the development process of the \nPSCIT and provides a guide to using the PSCIT.  The \ntool is based on a safety culture maturity model, which \ndescribes five stages of cultural evolution, from patholog-\nical to generative. The PSCIT consists of nine elements \nthat cover five patient safety culture dimensions, namely, \nleadership, risk analysis, workload management, sharing \nand learning and resource management. Each element \ndescribes the systems in place at each level of maturity, \nenabling organizations to identify their current level of \nmaturity and actions to move to the next level. The PSCIT \nshould be used with caution as there is currently a lack of \nreliability and validity data.\nHealthcare Quarterly  Vol.11 Special Issue  2008   11 \nsurveys have been likened to “describing the water to a drowning \nman; they tell you how bad things are but do little to help in \nsolving the problem” (Fleming 2003). Therefore, there is a need \nto provide healthcare organizations with more solution-focused \nsafety culture instruments. This can be achieved by identifying \nthe organizational practices required to promote a positive \npatient safety culture since an effective way to improve a culture \nis by changing the organization’s systems and processes. \nSafety culture surveys have been likened \nto “describing the water to a drowning man; they \ntell you how bad things are but do little to help in \nsolving the problem.”\nSchein (1990) argues that organizational culture is shaped \nthrough leadership action and systems that promote desired \nbehaviours, including the following: \n• Areas that leaders pay attention to, measure and control\n• Deliberate role-modelling and coaching by leaders\n• Operational criteria for the allocation of rewards and status \n• Operational criteria for recruitment, selection and  \npromotion\n• The organization’s design and structure \n• Organizational systems and procedures\nSchein’s (1990) view of culture suggests that the patient \nsafety culture is a reflection of the extent to which the above \nmechanisms support patient safety. For example, if managers are \nrewarded for reducing cost or cutting budgets with no consid -\neration for quality or patient safety, this is likely to limit the \npriority they place on safety, which is a key component of safety \nculture (Flin et al. 2000; Zohar 2000). \nSimilarly, Parker et al. (2006) argue that safety culture is \naffected by organizational changes, such as a change in leadership \nor the introduction of new systems and processes. This suggests \nthat safety culture is influenced by the systems, processes and \npractices of the organization. For example, an organization with \na poor safety culture will have limited safety systems, while an \norganization with a positive culture will have many systems in \nplace to promote patient safety. This argument suggests that \nit should be possible to assess the extent to which systems and \nprocesses promote a positive safety culture by evaluating organ-\nizational practices that influence the culture. This approach \nis supported by Zohar (2000) and Parker et al. (2006), who \nhave demonstrated that safety culture consists of both concrete \nand abstract aspects. The concrete aspects of safety culture are \ntangible and observable and can therefore be used to develop \na list of organizational practices that support a positive safety \nculture. More recently, Flin (2007) has argued that organiza -\ntional indicators of a positive safety culture allow management \nto both monitor patient safety culture and influence patient \nsafety outcomes. This argument is further supported by the \nrecent development and initial validation of a safety culture \nimprovement tool for the petrochemical industry by the current \nauthors. This tool uses concrete organizational indicators to \nassess the maturity of the safety culture (Fleming et al. 2007). \nBased on the success of the petrochemical industry tool, we \ndecided to develop a similar tool for healthcare. The Patient \nSafety Culture Improvement Tool (PSCIT) was developed to \nassess a number of important organizational practices that influ-\nence patient safety culture.\nDeveloping the Tool\nThe development of patient safety culture indicators requires \nthe specification of the cultural attributes that distinguish \nbetween “poor” and “good” safety cultures. Safety culture \nmaturity models describe the stages of safety culture develop -\nment (Fleming 2000). They are useful to organizations as they \nenable them to assess their current level of maturity (Paulk et al. \n1993) and to identify areas of particular strength and weakness \n(National Patient Safety Agency and School of Psychological \nSciences, University of Manchester 2006) and actions that \nneed to be taken to reach the next level of maturity (Paulk et \nal. 1993). The safety culture maturity model of Ashcroft et al. \n(2005) describes the stages of safety culture development; thus, \nit is a useful framework to use for the basis of the patient safety \nculture indicators. \nThe safety culture maturity model used by Ashcroft et al. \n(2005) to develop the Manchester Patient Safety Framework \nwas based on the work of Westrum (2004) and Reason (1998). \nAshcroft et al. (2005) described five levels of culture: patholog-\nical, reactive, calculative, proactive and generative. At the patho-\nlogical level of maturity, organizations see safety as a problem; \nthey suppress information and focus on blaming individuals to \nsupport the personal needs, power and glory of those in charge. \nOrganizations at the reactive level view safety as important but \nrespond only after significant harm has occurred. Calculative \norganizations tend to be fixated on rules, positions and depart-\nmental territory. After a safety incident has occurred, informa-\ntion may be ignored by this type of organization and failures \nexplained away or resolved, with no deeper inquiry into them. \nOrganizations at the proactive level focus their efforts on antici-\npating safety issues before they occur by involving a wide range \nof stakeholders in safety. Generative organizations actively seek \nout information to understand why they are safe and unsafe. \nInquiries into safety-related events serve as a means to attack \nthe underlying conditions, not just the immediate causes of the \nfailures. The characteristics of a high-reliability organization \ncan be likened to the characteristics of an organization that has \nMark Fleming and Natasha Wentzell  Patient Safety Culture Improvement Tool: Development and Guidelines for Use\n12    Healthcare Quarterly  Vol.11 Special Issue  2008\nreached the generative level of cultural maturity. This model \ncan be used to describe how organizations at different levels of \nmaturity approach safety culture improvement (Table 1).\nAlthough this model provides a useful framework for safety \nculture improvement and general guidance on the nature of a \npositive culture, it does not specify the systems and processes \nassociated with a positive patient safety culture. Therefore, \npatient safety culture indicators were developed by reviewing \nthe literature on patient safety culture perception surveys and \ncurrent guidelines on safety culture improvement (e.g., CCHSA \nRequired Organizational Practices).\nPatient safety culture is commonly assessed via a self-report \nperception survey (Fleming and Hartnell 2007). Reviews \nof patient safety culture instruments (e.g., Colla et al. 2005; \nFlin et al. 2006; Singla et al. 2006) have identified common \ncultural dimensions. Given that these instruments were devel -\noped independently using different populations, the common \nelements identified could be considered the fundamental \nbuilding blocks of patient safety culture. Table 2 identifies the \ncommon dimensions from these patient safety survey reviews. \nFrom the literature review on patient safety culture surveys, five \nmain patient safety indicators were identified and included in \nthe PSCIT . T o fully assess the systems and processes influencing \npatient safety, these five patient safety indicators were further \nbroken down into more detailed elements of patient safety (see \nTable 2). \nConsultation with Patient Safety Experts \nThe content and face validity of the original version of the \nPSCIT was tested by interviewing patient safety experts across \nTable 2.

Experts were sent the PSCIT in advance of the inter -\nview and asked to evaluate the tool for clarity, the extent to \nwhich the indicators were objective and the completeness of the \ntool. They were also asked to consider the extent to which the \nindicators would differentiate between organizations at different \nlevels of cultural maturity. \nFive interviews with patient safety experts were completed. \nInterviews were conducted over the telephone or face to face and \nwere tape-recorded with the participant’s permission. During \nthe interviews, participants commented on their ability to \nassess their own organization’s maturity and benefits of using \nthe PSCIT. The participants identified a number of potential \nimprovements to the PSCIT, such as the need to clarify some \nof the terms used as they differ across organizations. All the \nparticipants indicated that the PSCIT covered the important \naspects of patient safety culture and that it was easy to assess the \nmaturity of their systems using the instrument. Participants also \nindicated that reviewing the PSCIT was a useful exercise. In the \nwords of one participant, “This was excellent. I have identified a \nlist of improvement actions.” The PSCIT was revised as a result \nof the feedback provided during these interviews. \nUsing the PSCIT \nThe PSCIT was developed to enable healthcare organiza -\ntions to assess the maturity of the systems currently in place \nto promote a positive patient safety culture. (See Appendix 1 \nat http://www.longwoods.com/product.php?productid=19604 \nfor the revised PSCIT .) The PSCIT outlines increasing levels of \ncultural maturity and describes the systems associated with each \nlevel. The PSCIT provides organizations with a straightforward \nand structured process for reviewing the extent to which current \nsystems promote a positive safety culture. Improvement actions \nare identified by comparing current systems with the practices \nassociated with the next level of maturity. \nFor the best results, the PSCIT should be completed by a \nmultidisciplinary team, consisting of those with expertise in the \noperation of current patient safety systems, those with budgetary \nauthority and healthcare providers. The PSCIT can be used at \nthe organizational or departmental level. The appropriate level \nof analysis depends on the organizational structure; the impor-\ntant issues are budgetary authority and the ability to implement \nnew systems. For example, a surgical department could use the \ntool to identify opportunities for improvement as long as it has \nthe autonomy to implement new systems such as leadership \ntraining. If departments or units do not have control over all the \nelements (e.g., leader performance evaluation), they should skip \nthose elements that they cannot change and focus on evaluating \nthe elements that they can improve. \nInitially, team members should individually complete the \ntool, after which they should meet as a group to discuss their \nresults and reach a consensus. For each element, the team should \nassess the level of maturity of each indicator (e.g., incident \nreporting) by reviewing each level of maturity (from 0 to 4) and \nchoosing the maturity level that best describes the systems and \nFigure 1.

Once the level of maturity \nhas been chosen, the team should assess the degree of imple -\nmentation within their organization. Thus, for every indicator, \nthe team assesses the degree to which the systems described have \nbeen implemented across the organization or department by \nclassifying it as low (i.e., implemented in less than a third of \nthe organization/target group), medium (i.e., implemented in \nless than two thirds of the organization/target group) or high \n(i.e., implemented in over two thirds of the organization/target \ngroup) and inserting L, M or H in the box that corresponds to \nthis level. Figure 1 provides an example of what one indicator \nfrom the PSCIT looks like upon completion. The next step in \nthe process is to discuss the current systems and processes in \nmore detail (e.g., why it was developed, how effective it is) and \nto consider barriers to moving to the next level of maturity. The \nteam should only use the practices associated with the next level \nof maturity as a starting point for discussion and should not \nautomatically adapt these practices as an action plan. The focus \nof the discussion should be the development of a strategic plan \nfor improving the culture, including specific action plans that \ndescribe the steps the organization is going to take to reach the \nnext level of maturity. \nConclusions\nCreating a positive culture that promotes patient safety is one \nof the key challenges facing healthcare organizations. Recently, \nmany healthcare organizations have conducted safety culture \nsurveys to assess their current culture and identify areas for \nimprovement. It is likely that these organizations have experi -\nenced similar difficulties as those encountered by other indus -\ntries when they try to use their survey results to identify concrete \nactions to improve their culture (Fleming and Hartnell 2007). \nThe PSCIT was developed to assist organizations in their efforts \nto improve their culture. It assesses the organizational practices, \nsystems and processes related to nine patient safety culture \nelements. The results of the PSCIT provide a description of the \ncurrent state of an organization’s patient safety culture and can \nbe used to develop strategic plans to improve its level of patient \nsafety culture maturity. \nThe PSCIT has only recently been developed; thus, the \npsychometric properties (i.e., the reliability and validity) have \nnot been determined. Therefore, this tool should be used with \ncaution to facilitate discussion and support the identification \nof actions for cultural improvement. Given the early develop -\nmental stage, the PSCIT may not be a comprehensive assess -\nment of patient safety culture and should be considered a guide; \ntherefore, improvement teams should not limit the coverage of \npatient safety culture aspects they may wish to improve to those \ncovered by this tool. The maturity model approach to safety \nculture improvement is only one way to improve patient safety \nculture and is offered as a tool that healthcare organizations \ncan use on their journey to creating a positive safety culture. \nAdditional research is currently being developed and conducted \nto address the lack of reliability and validity data.  \nAbout the Authors \nMark Fleming, PhD, is with Saint Mary’s University in Halifax, \nNova Scotia.

Patient Safety Culture Improvement: Self Assessment Tool\nCompleted by: ______________________________________________________ \nDate: ________________________\nLevel of Assessment (Organization/Department): ________________________________\nSafety culture consists of shared perceptions and beliefs about safety. These perceptions are formed in part by leadership priorities and systems that promote \nthe relative importance of safety. Improving the culture involves organizational change by implementing new systems and processes. The first step in developing \nan action plan is reviewing the current systems in place to promote a positive patient safety culture. Once this has been established, then the organization must \nidentify opportunities for improving current systems. This tool is designed to support improvement teams to develop a strategic plan for improving the culture. \nInitially, team members should individually complete the assessment and then meet as a group to discuss their results and reach consensus. Then, for each \nelement, the team should consider ways of improving their current systems. It is often useful to use the description of the next highest level as a starting point for \ndiscussions, although teams should not simply use the descriptor of the next level as their action item. \nAssess your current systems by selecting the maturity level corresponding to the most accurate description of the systems that exist within your organization. \nIndicate the degree to which it has been implemented across the organization/department by classifying it as low (L – implemented in less than a third of the \norganization/department), medium (M – implemented in less than two thirds of the organization/department) and high (H – implemented in over two thirds of the \norganization/department). For example, if you judged the “Patient Safety Leader Education and Training” for senior managers in your organization to be at level \n1 and more than two thirds of senior managers had been provided with the information, you would insert an “H” in the box that corresponds to level 1 under the \nsenior managers column. If you have no knowledge of a particular system, then leave that section blank. \nPatient Safety Leadership\nSelect Level\nMaturity \nLevel\nPatient Safety Leader Education and Training   \nSenior \nManagers\nPhysician \nLeaders\nMiddle \nManagers\nFront-Line \nManagers\n0 No patient safety education/training is provided to leaders. \n1 General information on patient safety, including how it is measured, policies and procedures, is provided \nto leaders. \n2 Leaders receive information about their role in improving patient safety.   They receive nonrecurring \nknowledge-based training about leadership behaviours that promote patient safety. \n3 Leaders are taught interpersonal competencies (through skill-based training) to motivate colleagues and \nsubordinates to improve patient safety. Training is recurrent (at least annual) and includes target setting \nto improve interpersonal skills.\n4 Leaders receive mandatory individualized patient safety leadership development based on upward \nappraisal and evaluation. There is a formal ongoing evaluation of leaders’ behavioural change. \nPatient Safety Culture Improvement Tool: \nDevelopment and Guidelines for Use\nMark Fleming and Natasha Wentzell\nCreating a Patient Safety Culture\n\n2    Healthcare Quarterly  Vol.11 Special Issue  2008 \nSelect Level\nMaturity \nLevel\nPatient Safety Leader Performance Evaluation\nSenior \nManagers\nPhysicians \nLeaders\nMiddle \nManagers\nFront-Line \nManagers\n0 Leaders are not evaluated on patient safety. \n1 Promoting and assessing patient safety is included in the leaders’ job description. Leader performance \nis evaluated following a significant patient safety event (e.g., unexpected death) within their area of \nresponsibility.   \n2 There is a formal system in place to monitor performance and performance reviews are conducted for \nleaders. Leaders’ performance is monitored through regular discussions of cases and outcomes. \n3 Performance is routinely monitored using a variety of techniques (e.g., performance reviews, \nretrospective chart reviews). Input from colleagues is sought. Results from monitoring are discussed \nwith individual being reviewed. \n4 Performance is monitored with leading indicators of patient safety. Ongoing and systematic \nobservations of practice are conducted. The results from performance monitoring are used to develop \nindividual learning plans. Peers routinely monitor each other’s performance and provide constructive \nfeedback for improvement.   \nWorkload Management \nSelect Level\nMaturity \nLevel\nWorkload\nPhysicians \nNurses \nResidents\nAllied Health \nProfessionals\n0 No consideration of the impact of workload on patient safety. \n1 Guidelines for the ratio of healthcare workers to patients are used to manage workload levels. \n2 Minimum healthcare worker–to–patient ratios are set based on available evidence and best practice. \nThese levels are monitored closely and actions taken when minimum standards are not met.    \n3 In addition to evidence-based minimum staffing levels, staffing decisions take into consideration \nclient group’s needs and the experience and skill mix of the healthcare team. \n4 There is a holistic approach to workload management that considers all the demands placed on \nhealthcare workers, such as the intensity of the work environment (i.e., the tasks to be performed, \nnumber of client interactions), client acuity and the skill mix of the healthcare team. This approach \ninvolves providing additional resources for high-intensity situations, where treatment must be \nprovided immediately and when members of the healthcare team are less experienced. \nPatient Safety Culture Improvement Tool: Development and Guidelines for Use  Mark Fleming and Natasha Wentzell  \nPatient Safety Leadership cont’d\nHealthcare Quarterly  Vol.11 Special Issue  2008   3 \nSelect Level \nMaturity \nLevel\nFatigue Management\nPhysicians\nNurses \nResidents\nAllied Health \nProfessionals \n0 No consideration of the impact of fatigue on patient safety. \n1 Fatigue is acknowledged as a patient safety risk factor. Fatigue-management efforts focus on limiting \nthe number of hours worked per shift and per week. \n2 Strategic plan developed to redesign shift rotations (length and timing) that are increasing fatigue or \nare contrary to evidence and best practice.\n3 Fatigue-management plan (ensures shift rotation does not contribute to increasing healthcare worker \nfatigue) is implemented and monitored. This plan includes leading practices in fatigue management \nsuch as sleep contracts (formal agreements about the amount of sleep between shifts that encourage \nhealthcare workers to rest while they are off shift).\n4 Fatigue is identified as a form of impairment influencing cognitive performance (e.g., decision-making, \ndigit span). Performance is routinely monitored using validated instruments to provide information on \nthe level of impairment and enables healthcare workers to self-assess their performance and take \nremedial action (e.g., request support from colleagues). \nResource Management \nSelect Level\nMaturity \nLevel\nTraining \nClinical \nNon-clinical\nManagers\n0 No resource management training (interpersonal skills, communication, team working, personal awareness or \ndecision-making) is provided. \n1 Information about resource management is provided to promote working effectively within a team environment. \n2 Knowledge-based interdisciplinary resource management training is provided. \n3 Skill-based (includes practice and feedback) resource management training is provided. The training program is \ndeveloped/adapted to address the specific needs of the interdisciplinary team and is based on analysis of team \nworking challenges.\n4 Resource management training includes practice in a simulated environment and is followed by behavioural \nobservation of performance using validated indicators. Feedback is provided to all individuals after training, and a \nformal evaluation of the training’s effectiveness is conducted.\nWorkload Management  cont’d\nMark Fleming and Natasha Wentzell  Patient Safety Culture Improvement Tool: Development and Guidelines for Use\n4    Healthcare Quarterly  Vol.11 Special Issue  2008 \nSharing and Learning   \nMaturity \nLevel\nOrganizational Learning Select \nLevel\n0 There are no systems in place to support organizational learning. \n1 Events that result in significant harm (e.g., wrong-site surgery) are investigated, and actions are specified to prevent the \nreoccurrence of this specific event. \n2 All event reports are investigated using validated tools and processes (e.g., root-cause analysis). Patient safety improvement \nactions are identified from the investigation and implementation tracked. \n3 An integrated investigation system is implemented (e.g., incident reporting system, retrospective chart reviews and clinical audit \nprocess). Detailed results of investigations for each department are discussed with staff on a regular basis, and summary results \nare shared across the organization. \n4 A comprehensive organizational learning system is in place that includes incident reporting, retrospective chart review and audits.   \nThe organization learns from both negative and positive outcomes by identifying the practices that protect patients as well as those \nthat increase risk. \n \nMaturity \nLevel\nIncident Reporting Select \nLevel\n0 There are no reporting systems in place. \n1 Incident report forms or electronic reporting system is available to enable staff to report patient safety events and concerns. \n2 Incident reporting system (either paper or electronic) is in place. Training on how to use the system is provided to all staff. Learning \nfrom reported incidents is used in patient safety training. Reports have the option for individuals to identify themselves so that \nadditional information about the incident can be obtained.\n3 Independent incident reporting system is used to facilitate confidential (not anonymous) reporting. Managers identify common \nthemes from the reports and discuss them at department meetings. There are mechanisms in place to provide information to all \nstaff (e.g., monthly summaries are provided to all staff). \n4 Incident reporting system includes detailed description of the event. Events are coded by a human factors expert and follow-up \ndiscussions (e.g., by telephone) are conducted with the person who reported the incident. There is a formal process in place to \ntrack every incident and the outcomes associated with it. Incidents are used as learning tools; each incident is described to all staff \nmembers and the actions resulting from the report are explained.   \nMaturity \nLevel\nDisclosure* Select \nlevel\n0 No disclosure policy in place.\n1 Disclosure policy in place as per the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation (CCHSA) guidelines.†\n2 Disclosure training offered to all staff (including physicians) including requirements under the policy. \n3 Disclosure training is given to all staff (including physicians). Patients and families of those involved in an adverse event provide \ninput into the training and are consulted on an ongoing basis to seek feedback on how disclosure is managed. \n4 Use of retrospective chart audit to assess quality (and extent) of disclosure when harm has occurred. \n*The core elements of disclosure as identified by CCHSA are discussing the adverse event itself, acknowledging/apologizing for the adverse event, reviewing the actions taken to mitigate the circumstances, \ndiscussing the corrective action to prevent further adverse events and answering the questions of the patient/client and/or family.\n†CCHSA (2007) guidelines state that a “formal (transparent) policy and process of disclosure of adverse events to patients/families, including support mechanisms for patients, family and care/service providers” \nmust be implemented.\nPatient Safety Culture Improvement Tool: Development and Guidelines for Use  Mark Fleming and Natasha Wentzell  \nHealthcare Quarterly  Vol.11 Special Issue  2008   5 \nRisk Analysis\nMaturity \nLevel\nSafety Analysis Systems Select \nLevel\n0 No systematic use of safety analysis systems to promote patient safety. \n1 Safety analysis tools are used for major events. For example, retrospective analysis tools (e.g., root-cause analysis) are used to \ninvestigate the causes of events that resulted in significant harm (e.g., wrong-site surgery), and prospective analysis tools are used \nwhen planning major organizational changes such as a new building. \n2 Safety analysis tools are used frequently. The analysis is led by patient safety specialists with involvement of healthcare workers. \n3 A wide range of healthcare workers are competent in using safety analysis tools. Healthcare workers regularly use these tools to \nlearn from incidents and identify ways of improving patient care. \n4 Safety analysis systems are integrated into the routine activities of healthcare workers; the effectiveness of the system is \nmonitored. For example, actions identified during a prospective analysis are tracked to ensure they were implemented and worked \nas intended. \nMark Fleming and Natasha Wentzell  Patient Safety Culture Improvement Tool: Development and Guidelines for Use"
