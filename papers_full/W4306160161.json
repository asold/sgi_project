    "abstract": "A shell-type medium frequency transformer (MFT) using amorphous alloy material is designed for high-power electronic applications. The optimal area product design method is adopted to design an MFT, which maximizes the high efficiency and power density, minimizes the loss and volume, and meets the limitations of insulation and temperature rise. Then, a 20 kVA/10 kHz MFT is designed. To ensure the rationality of the MFT design, the magnetic properties of the amorphous alloy material are measured, and finite element simulations are carried out based on measured magnetic properties. The magnetic flux density, loss, and temperature rise of the designed MFT are analyzed. Finally, a 20 kVA/10 kHz MFT prototype is fabricated, and experimental tests are carried out. The loss and temperature rise of the MFT prototype are within reason, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",
