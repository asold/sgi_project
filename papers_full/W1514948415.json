  "full_text": "The manual skills and cognition that lie behind hominid tool use\nRichard Byrne\nUniversity of St Andrews, Scotland\n[In A E Russon and D R Begun (Eds.) Evolutionary origins of great ape intelligence.  Cambridge\nUniversity Press, in press.]\nTool use is an important aspect of being human that has assumed a central place in accounts of\nthe evolutionary origins of  human intelligence.  This has inevitably focused a spotlight on any\nsigns of tool use or manufacture in great apes and other non-human animals, to the relative\nneglect of skills that do not involve tools.  The aim of this chapter is to explore whether this\nemphasis is appropriate. Could it be that we may learn as much about the origin of human\nintelligence from skilled manual behaviour in general?  Suppose we take this broader view,\naccepting evidence from all manifestations of manual skill, what can we learn of the mental\ncapacities of the great apes and ourselves?  My own ultimate purpose is to use comparative\nevidence from living species to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the many cognitive traits\nthat came together to make human psychology.  The cognition of great apes is the obvious\nstarting point, to trace the more primitive (i.e. ancient) cognitive aptitudes that are still important\nto us today.  In this chapter, I focus on great ape cognition as it is expressed in manual skills,\nbased on cognitive aspects of tool use and manufacture considered significant in the human\nevolutionary lineage.\nWhy is tool use important in the study of human evolution?\nConsider first what aspects of tool use have recommended it as “special” to physical\nanthropologists and archaeologists.  Most obviously, tools are convenient things for investigators.\nAs physical objects, they can be collected, measured, and compared with ease.  Often durable,\nthey can be investigated long after the tool user or maker is dead.  For archaeologists, this\ncharacteristic alone adds enormous value to tools in the study of human origins.  Convenience\nalone would be little recommendation if tool skills were trivial.  But of course, quite the reverse is\nbelieved to be the case.\nThe significance of tools is what they imply about the cognitive abilities of their users.\nFrom examining the products of tool making and using, researchers hope to discern the thinking\nthat governed these activities: everyday physics, means-end analysis, coordination of dextrous\n2\nmanipulations towards a predefined goal, recognizing and coping with local difficulties in a\ncomplex process, and so on.  I contend that these cognitive abilities are equally required by many\ntasks that do not involve tool use, especially complex manual skills, and that neglect of the study\nof manual skills has been an impediment to understanding great apes’ technological abilities, and\ntherefore to understanding the evolutionary origins of human technological ability (Byrne 1996,\n1999; and see Yamakoshi, this volume, for a related view).\nMoreover, little help in understanding the origins of complex manual skills has been\navailable from psychology.  The mechanisms controlling reaching and grasping and their\ndevelopment have been carefully analysed (Connolly 1998; Fitts & Posner, 1967), but until\nrecently little attention has been paid to what is done with an object once grasped (Bril, Roux, &\nDietrich, 2000; Roux, 2000).  This chapter, then, also constitutes something of a plea for\nbroader-based research on the psychology of skill acquisition, and the relationship between\ncomplex manual tasks and mental abilities.\nWhat is special about human tool use?\nIdentification of qualitative differences between human and non-human tool making may\nenable us to identify which facets of cognition and which particular aspects of technical skills\nwere likely to have been crucial in human evolution.  Some clear differences have been\nsuggested.  All known human populations fabricate composite tools out of many component parts\n(Gosselain, 2000; Reynolds, 1982): nets, hafted spears, and even boats.  Also, human tools are\noften used to make or assist other tools, in a range of ways, from slings and throwing sticks, to\ncarving wood with adze and knife or smelting metal.  And human tool materials range from wood\nand stone to hair, bone, horn, plant seeds, and metal, according to the task in hand.  Tools of\nnon-humans are poor things in comparison (unless bee and wasp nests, and the bowers and\nnests of birds, are treated as tools, in which case the contest is a closer one: but these feats are\nspecies-typical and presumably innately coded).\nHowever, those highly distinctive characteristics of human tool making—composite\ntools, tool-use to make tools, the rich array of raw material—may be relatively new even in\nhuman evolution (Mellars & Stringer, 1989).  In hominin deposits that date from before the\narrival of anatomically modern humans, archaeologists are hard pressed to find uncontroversial\nevidence of tools going beyond single items, made by removing parts rather than combining\nitems, and only of stone or sometimes wood. The animals that made these simpler tools were\nanatomically much closer to modern humans than they were to living great apes.  We may fairly\nask, then, whether there exist critical aspects of human tool making, and the cognitive abilities\n3\nthat they imply, that predate anatomically modern humans.  If so, other less ostentatious\ncapacities may represent derived cognitive features of the human lineage, “special” nonetheless\nbecause they are shared by some of our extinct relatives but not by any other living animal1.\nAlternatively, the tools of the earliest members of the human lineage and their relatives may have\ntapped only primitive cognitive capacities shared with living non-human primates.  It is of course\npossible that all these accounts are true for different aspects of tool-related cognition: some\nuniquely human, some unique to the human line, some shared with living great apes, and some\nshared with a much wider range of species.  Modern human competence with tools may have a\nlong evolutionary history.\nTo find out, the most crucial species to examine are our closest living relatives, the great\napes. All great apes sometimes use tools (McGrew, 1989).  The lesser apes do not use tools and\nlittle is known of their manual skills, so they will not be considered further; “apes”, hereafter, will\nrefer to great apes.  Are there unique features of the tool skills of the great ape clade (including\nhumans)?  To find out, it is necessary first to establish a baseline, asking: what tools do non-ape\nanimal species use?\nTool using in animals other than apes\nAlthough most species use none, tool use is quite widely distributed across animal taxa\n(Beck, 1980).  In many cases, the available evidence constitutes only a single reported instance of\na particular individual making a particular tool, and provides little detail on method (e.g.\nChevalier-Skolnikoff & Liska, 1993).  This picture is as true of monkeys as it is of most other\nanimals.  Some species of animal, but not monkeys, do use tools habitually, in consistent ways\nIn these cases, individuals are often found to use one sort of tool for one purpose, but members\nof closely related species show no tool use or any other exceptional behaviour.  Famous\nexamples are the woodpecker finches of the Galapagos (where no true woodpeckers exist),\nwhich use cactus spines as probes; Egyptian vultures, which use stones to break ostrich eggs; and\nCalifornian sea otters, which use stones to break the shells of molluscs.  Other species of\nDarwin’s finch, and other species of otter, do not use tools.\nSince habitual tool use of non-apes is generally limited to one species in a large clade, and\nthe tool use functions in a highly specific way, the distinction might be that ape tool use is learnt\nfrom experience, while tool use in other animals is innate, coded on the species’ genes.\nUnfortunately for this tidy partitioning, some non-apes do learn their tool using habits.  Only\ncertain populations of Egyptian vultures have discovered how to use stones to break into ostrich\neggs; others cannot exploit this valuable resource; and learning is likely involved (Goodall and\n4\nvan Lawick, 1966).  The most telling signs of learning tool use come from the sea otter where\nand traditional transmission is involved.  Alaskan sea otters do not use tools but Californian\notters (the same species) show either of two tool techniques, with different sized stones, to break\neither abalones and crabs.  Abalones and crabs occur in the range of all otters, but individuals\nspecialize on one or the other, and daughters acquire the same tool technique as their mothers\n(Riedman, Staedier, Estes, & Hrabrich, 1989).\nIf incidental/habitual and learned/innate distinctions do not hold up, will some other\nsplit serve to characterise the uniqueness of ape tool use?  Otters, vultures and finches may use\ntools, but do not manufacture them (unless detaching cactus spines is accepted as manufacture).\nOrangutans (van Schaik, 1994) and chimpanzees (Goodall, 1964) do sometimes manufacture\ntools.  Until recently, the possibility that the crucial distinction is that manufacture of tools is\nunique to apes worked well.  Now, however, some local populations of New Caledonia crows\nCorvus moneduloides have been found to manufacture tools, modifying stems and leaves to create\nhooks and barbs for extracting insects from crevices (Hunt, 1996, 2000).\nA chimpanzee’s view of the archaeological record of tool use\nAlthough no such simple dichotomy marks out ape tool use from that of all other\nanimals, for an evolutionist the behaviour of apes nevertheless has a special relevance to the\nunderstanding of human origins.  When humans and apes are alike in some trait, not shared by\nother anthropoid primates, the trait is likely to exist by virtue of common descent—whereas any\nsimilarity with crows and otters doubtless results from convergent evolution.  .  What ape tool\nuse amounts to and whether it differs in any crucial way from that of the early representatives of\nthe human lineage, then, potentially informs us about the evolutionary history of distinctively human\nmental abilities.\nOne living ape, the chimpanzee, is famous for its range of habitual tool use and tool\nmanufacture in the wild.  Found stones are employed to hammer open nuts on wood or stone\nanvils, sticks are used to pick up ants, stems and vines to “fish” for termites in their mounds or\nants within arboreal nest-holes, leaves as rain shelters or sponges or cleaning tissues, etc. (Boesch\n& Boesch, 1990; Goodall, 1986; McGrew, 1992; Nishida, 1986; Sugiyama, 1994; Sugiyama &\nKoman, 1979; Yamakoshi, this volume).  Their methods of making tools from plants alone\ninclude detaching plant material, cutting it to length, removing leaves or bark, and sharpening the\nend—or all of these methods, for a single tool.  Orangutans also make tools of plant material\n(Fox, Sitompul, & Van Schaik, 1999), for probing and scraping.\n5\nThese discoveries make it impossible to disregard the potential importance of plant\nmaterial and found objects in ancestral humans’ tool use, although archaeologists will seldom\ndetect them.  Archaeology nonetheless reveals one characteristic not shown by any living great\nape under natural conditions, percussion flaking of stone.  One line of argument would have us\nstop there.  Humans make stone tools, (some of) their extinct ancestors and relatives did too, but\napes (and other animals) don’t.\nHowever, the significance of stone tool use and manufacture is not simply the kind of\nphysical material is used and modified, but what we can glean about the cognitive capacities of\nthe tool user.  In exploring what stone flaking tells us about the mind of the tool-maker, we are\nvery dependent on the quality of the evidence and the level of analysis it can sustain.  At one\nlevel, percussion flaking is simply the modification of a found object by detachment of parts.  As\nsuch, it falls in the same category as a chimpanzee stripping off the leaves and sharpening the tip\nof a stem.  At another level, the particular method of stone modification may imply greater\ncognitive abilities in our extinct ancestors, but in the case of stone tools traditionally described as\nOldowan, this implication has been disputed (Wynn & McGrew, 1989).\nWithout necessarily accepting the conclusion, the process of point-by-point comparison\nin this argument is informative (see Joulian, 1996, for detailed analysis of chimpanzee behaviour\nfrom an archaeological perspective).  Percussion flaking shows the ability to aim blows with care\nand precision.  So, however, does a chimpanzee’s hammering open a Panda nut (Boesch &\nBoesch, 1990).  Young chimpanzees’ blows are usually ineffective, only knocking the nut away,\nand it takes years for a chimpanzee to become proficient, so comparable levels of precision may\narguably be required.  Oldowan tools are clearly made to a simple design concept: small enough\nto hold and with a sharp edge (Roche, 1989; Toth, 1985b).  But so are a chimpanzee’s termiting\nprobes:  sufficient flexibility, length, and smoothness to penetrate deep into a termite mound\n(Goodall, 1964).  Because the probes are sometimes made in advance of reaching the mound, the\nchimpanzee must possess some concept of an adequate tool (Goodall, 1986).  Percussion flaking\nalso normally implies bimanual handling.  But Oldowan stones may sometimes have been flaked\nby throwing them against a hard surface, a techinique that one bonobo discovered and used\nsuccessfully (Toth, 1985b; Toth, Schick, Savage-Rumbaugh, Sevcik, & Rumbaugh, 1993).\nFor the more advanced products of the middle and upper Paleolithic, and even some\nlower Paleolithic stone cultures (e.g. Acheulean), a very different picture emerges.  Precision\nhandling (Napier, 1961), bimanual role differentiation in which the two hands perform in\ndifferent but complementary tasks (Elliott & Connolly, 1984), very precise aiming of powerful\nblows, and a sequential plan of flake removal are all essential to make tools characteristic of these\n6\ncultures.  Also evident within the process are hierarchical organization and exquisite guidance by\nan anticipatory schema of the finished product—in Acheulean hand-axes, for instance, iterative\ndetachment of large flakes followed by corrective detachments towards a straight edge  (Wynn,\n1988), and in Levallois “tortiseshell flakes”, elaborate preparations before the final blow\n(Oakley, 1949).  Until recently, it was possible to argue for a relatively late origin for these\ndistinctively human skills in tool manufacture, and to portray the earlier, Oldowan skills as ape-\nlike, differing only in the matter of the material used.\nRemarkable evidence now shows that this picture is not correct, and also illustrates the\nfragility of deduction from the patchy archaeological record, especially concerning ascriptions of\nincompetence.  Roche et al (1999) excavated stone material from Lokalalei , Kenya, dating from\n2.34 Mya (well before typical Oldowan dates), that allows reconstruction of the process of\ndetachment of up to 30 flakes from a single artefact, by a “refit” of the debris.  A large series of\nstone cores show the same principles applied to each, and knappers were clearly able to maintain\nthe precise strike angle for successful flaking throughout these long manufacturing sequences.\nThe tools and their debris are not associated with skeletal material, so which species made them\nis not known.  What is clear is that these human-like capacities of tool manufacture, well beyond\nthe cognitive capacities shown in ape tool use, are more ancient than ever suspected.\nAssessing the cognition of ape manual skills\nWe can then use the distinctive cognitive characteristics known to be associated with tool\nuse in Homo sapiens, whether extinct hominins or modern people who still make their own tools,\nas a guide to what evolutionary precursors of modern human skills might in principle be found\nin living apes.  In the following list, I have omitted those cognitive features that seem\ncharacteristic only of anatomically modern humans: use of tools to make tools, constructing new\nobjects out of multiple components, and using a wide range of raw material for tools.  In\naddition, I largely omit discussion of an important archaeological feature, material transport, in\nwhich raw material is carried to a suitable working site or working takes place where material\noccurs and finished tools are then transported. Living apes are primarily forest animals with\nrelatively small home ranges: they have little or no need of systematic transport of materials, so\nlack of it tells us little of their cognitive capacities.  The aim of the following list is to concentrate\non features likely to offer helpful guidance to manual skills in apes, skills that therefore predate\nthe divergence of the human lineage.\n• precision handling: e.g. tip-to-tip precision grips, rather than whole-hand power grips useful\nonly in rough and ready manipulation (Christel, 1993; Marzke & Wullstein, 1995).\n7\n• accurate aiming of powerful blows: e.g. to detach a useful flake, blows must be highly accurate\nin placement, yet still forceful (Inizian, Reduron-Ballinger, Roche, & Tixier, 1999).\n• bimanual role differentiation: e.g. holding a stone securely while aiming a blow at it with a\nhammer—the two hands perform different actions but in a complimentary way, so that they\nwork together to achieve a single purpose (Connolly, 1998; Elliott & Connolly, 1984).\n• regular and sequential plan: e.g. in percussion flaking, the order of detachments is normally\ncrucial to the final result (Inizian, et al., 1999; Pelegrin, 2000).\n• hierarchical organization with use of subroutines (Bruner, 1970; Elliott & Connolly, 1974;\nLashley, 1951; Miller, Galanter, & Pribram, 1960): e.g. flake detachments may be grouped into\nseveral series, of variable length according to the particular properties of the stone being worked,\nand each series achieves a distinct purpose—the overall plan of manufacture therefore consists\nof several subroutines, each performed to a local criterion of completeness (Inizian, et al., 1999;\nPelegrin, 2000).\n• corrective guidance by anticipatory schema, i.e. actions corrected to attain a goal specified in\nadvance (de Groot, 1965): e.g. if there is no appropriate angle for flaking, then first construct a\nplatform; if the main flakes do not produce a straight cutting edge, then make additional small\ndetachments until straightness is achieved (Pelegrin, 2000; Wynn, 1988).\n• high individual manual laterality: e.g. in a community of tool-makers, each individual always\nuses the same hand for the same task (Marchant, McGrew, & Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1995).\n• population right-handedness: e.g. for tool-making, a significant majority of individuals are\nsimilarly lateralized, such that the left hand provides support while the right applies precision\nactions (Marchant, et al., 1995; McManus, 1984).\nWith this perspective, we can now examine evidence from the living great apes.  As\nemphasized earlier, this evidence need not be restricted to tools.  In particular, manipulation of\nplant material may tap the same cognitive processes as tool use: both deal with operations that\nchange the physical world, often by applying force, so both rely heavily on understanding cause-\neffect and organizing simple movements into complex programs (and see Yamakoshi, this\nvolume).  I therefore draw also on the gathering and processing of plant foods by great apes, as\nmanifestations of manual skill.\nTwo provisos should be mentioned, to avoid misunderstanding: both concern the\nmeaning of skill.  Firstly, to ethnographers and social anthropologists, skilled manual activity is\nseen as necessarily “situated”: not the actions of single, clever individuals but within a social\nnetwork of knowledge and support.  Almost all the great ape skills described here are sometimes\nperformed in social circumstances, and social transmission of this expertise is considered crucial.\n8\nHowever, to date, most study has focused on individual apes rather than a social nexus.  The aim\nof this chapter is therefore a more modest one, to characterize the cognitive processes of great\napes relating to their ability to master complex manual skills.  Secondly, in some branches of\npsychology (e.g. sport psychology), “skill” refers to the degree of perfection of muscle control in\na movement, such as throwing a ball or pushing a cursor.  Primatologists do not doubt that\ndifferences in muscle control are sometimes important to apes engaged in the sort of activities\ndiscussed here; however, we have no way of studying this in wild animals.  Rather, the focus of\nall work discussed here will usually be higher level analysis, the organization of individual\nelements of action (such as throwing or pushing) into complexes that serve to accomplish tasks.\nManual skill, therefore, is here taken to be the sum of psychological processes that enable the\ndevelopment and perfection of complex, goal-directed manual skills by individuals.\nCognition in the manual skills of living great apes\nEvidence on living apes comes from very different sources, for good reason when it\nreflects ecological specialization in different species, and also because of coincidences of what\naspects have attracted the most research.  This means comparison is not straightforward.  I first\nexamine the different genera, before attempting an overall summary of cognitive capacities\ncommon to the clade.\nPan: the chimpanzee species\nThe two species of chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus, were recognized as\ndistinct from each other in the 1920s, but scientific study has always focused on the more\ncommon species, Pan troglodytes.  The discovery that common chimpanzees not only use but\nmake tools (Goodall, 1964) has accentuated this research emphasis.  Little field data was available\non Pan paniscus, the bonobo or pygmy chimpanzee, until the 1970s (Badrian & Badrian, 1984;\nBadrian & Malenky, 1984; Kano, 1982, 1983).  Long-term study at two sites has subsequently\nfailed to find any tool use involving skilled manipulation or tool manufacture in bonobos (but\nsee Ingmanson, 1989, 1996), and their foraging and food processing skills have yet to be studied.\nOne captive bonobo, however, readily learned to make stone flakes to cut rope securing a food\nbox (Toth, et al., 1993).  He largely worked by throwing his stone core at a hard substrate, with\nno need of careful aim, so there may be no real difference in mental capacities between P. paniscus\nand P. troglodytes (see McGrew, 1989).  The manual skills of Pan, then, are better gauged from\nbehaviour recorded in P. troglodytes\n9\nMost chimpanzee tool use shows no particular sign of mental capacities beyond the\nassociation of tool and task, and it is hard to establish how deeply tool users understand the\ncause-and-effect relations of what they are doing—the main cognitive ability that is relevant (but\nsee Limongelli, Boysen, & Visalberghi, 1995).  However, there is evidence that chimpanzee tool\nuse is pre-planned, not evoked by stimuli in the situation of use.  Stone hammers are sometimes\nselected in advance of use, according to criteria of fitness for purpose, then transported up to 0.5\nkm to the nut-cracking site (Boesch & Boesch, 1983, 1984); insect fishing probes are sometimes\nmade in advance to a simple pattern, then carried to the termite mound (Goodall, 1986, 1973).\nTool selection or manufacture prior to transport to the site of use clearly indicates mental\nspecification of the goal in advance of need (anticipatory schema).  Their tool making has not\nshown corrective guidance, on-line, with detailed comparison with the goal specification: no\nerror-correction during manufacture has been described.  However, this may be a function of the\ndifficulty of detection.  Error correction in tool use has been seen, a stone wedge used to\nstraighten an anvil stone for more efficient use (Matsuzawa, 1996).  This may have been a\nresponse to practical failure, so we cannot be sure that the modification reflected recognizing a\nmismatch with a pre-conceived plan.  Chimpanzees at Mt Niéniokoué, Ivory Coast, apparently\nevaluate nuts they intend to crack, giving a single blow and then sometimes abandoning the task:\nthey appear to observers to be testing nuts’ weight, maturity and density, all factors affecting the\ntask of cracking (F Joulian, pers. comm.).  These impressions, if confirmed, may reflect on-line\ncorrective guidance of the nut-cracking task.\nDespite the awkwardness of the chimpanzee hand, with relatively long fingers and short\nthumb (Napier, 1960), chimpanzees show precision handling and bimanual role differentiation in\nnumerous ways when they make and use tools.  They make probe tools used to “dip” for ants\nare by holding a stick in one hand and stripping protruding leaves or bark with the other, using a\nprecision grip; they steady wobbly anvils with one hand while the other wields the hammer-\nstone; etc. (Boesch & Boesch, 1983, 1990)  In addition, bimanual role differentiation and precise,\nvisually-guided handling are shown in manual body grooming (Goodall, 1986), and in manual\npreparation of woolly-surfaced leaves of the sugar mulberry Broussonettia, difficult to eat without\nrolling (Stokes & Byrne, 2001).\nOne task that nicely shows the advantage of precision handling and bimanual control is\nthat of eating aggressive Dorylus ants.  To capture these ants, chimpanzees insert a stick into a\nmass of ants and agitate it, provoking the ants to attack and climb the stick.  At Taï, chimpanzees\nwait until about 10cm of a relatively short stick is covered with ants and then pick off the ants\nwith the lips (Boesch & Boesch, 1990). At Gombe, chimpanzees wait until around 30cm of a\n10\nlong wand is covered with ants.  Then, with a sweeping movement of the other hand, half-closed\nin a precision grip, they accumulate a mass of ants which they eat rapidly (McGrew, 1974).  This\ndifference in technique probably reflects local adaptation to the various species of Dorylus ants,\nwhich vary in aggressiveness, since at Bossou, Guinea, where several species occur, individual\nchimpanzees use both techniques differentially, according to the species of ant and its current\nactivity (T. Humle, pers comm).\nThe manual technique for eating Broussonettia leaves gives some evidence of hierarchical\norganization (Stokes & Byrne, 2001).  Hierarchical structure has not been explicitly shown for\nany chimpanzee tool using task, although this is most likely only because cognitive organization\nhas seldom been examined.  Matsuzawa (2001), suggests that a wide range of chimpanzee tool-\nusing shows hierarchical organization, in a somewhat different way.\nCertainly, sequential task organization towards an eventual goal, sometimes in several\nstages, is shown in many chimpanzee tool-using tasks.   Examples are insect fishing and\nhammer-and-anvil use, in each of which the sequence may start with preparing or selecting a tool\nand transporting it to the site of use.  Iteration of a regular string of actions until a criterion is\nreached gives evidence that the iterated string constitutes a subroutine of the main process\n(Byrne, 1999a):  repeatedly agitating a dipping stick until ants reach a predetermined point, or\nrepeatedly moving a stone anvil about until it is level, suggest this form of organization.\nMoreover, the manufacture and use of several different tools in series to obtain a single goal has\noccasionally been noted (Brewer & McGrew, 1990; Suzuki, Kuroda, & Nishihara, 1995), again\nsuggesting the ability to apply a regular and systematic sequence of actions, although each tool\nmight have been made in response only to the outcomes of the previous tool’s use.\nManual laterality in chimpanzees has been studied for many years, with controversy in\nboth methods and conclusions (see Finch, 1941; Hopkins & Morris, 1993; Marchant & McGrew,\n1991; McGrew & Marchant, 1991).  Now a clearer picture is beginning to emerge.  In most\nspontaneous manual actions in the wild, individuals are generally ambidextrous (Marchant &\nMcGrew, 1996).  However, individual lateralization has been found to be high in termite fishing\n(McGrew & Marchant, 1992), stone tool use (Boesch, 1991; Sugiyama, Fushimi, Sakura, &\nMatsuzawa, 1993), and manually cracking large Strychnos fruits (fruits must be pounded,\naccurately, against a hard object to break them: McGrew, Marchant, Wrangham, & Klein, 1999).\nThis collection of tasks suggests that lateralization is a strategy for enhancing manual precision,\nparticularly if accurately aimed blows are necessary: presumably, one hand can specialize in\nperfecting a particularly difficult skill.  In termite fishing, exclusively lateralized chimpanzees\nworked more quickly than weakly lateralized or ambidextrous individuals (McGrew & Marchant,\n11\n1999), although they must suffer corresponding disadvantages, compared with ambidextrous\nindividuals, from having to adjust their posture to each termite mound.  However, manual\nlaterality is found in a plethora of other contexts and animal species (see review by Bradshaw &\nRogers, 1993), suggesting there may be reasons for lateralized function beyond simple efficiency.\nBimanual role differentiation, which also serves task complexity, may be one of these other\nreasons: in captive chimpanzees, strong laterality was evoked by a task requiring bimanual\nsolution, prising out food from a hollow object held in the other hand (Hopkins, 1995).\nAssessment of whether population right-handedness occurs depends on which statistical\nmethods are considered adequate (Hopkins, 1999; McGrew & Marchant, 1991), but on current\nevidence there is no sign of this distinctively human trait in wild chimpanzees (McGrew &\nMarchant, 1996).\nGorilla: the gorilla species.\nGorillas exist in two widely separated populations, whose obvious morphological\ndifferences are at last leading towards their recognition as species (Groves, 2000), the western\nGorilla gorilla and the eastern Gorilla beringei.  All captive studies concern the former, whereas all\nfield studies on manual behaviour concern one subspecies of the latter, the mountain gorilla G. b.\nberingei.  The gorilla hand is more human proportioned than the chimpanzee hand (Christel,\n1993; Napier, 1960, 1961), and in captivity, western gorillas readily make tools (McGrew, 1989;\nParker, Kerr, Markowitz, & Gould, 1999), but no tool use of any sort has been reported from\nthe wild.  Instead, mountain gorillas use complex and skilful techniques for gathering and\nprocessing plant material (Byrne & Byrne, 1991; Byrne & Byrne, 1993; Byrne, Corp, & Byrne,\n2001a; Schaller, 1963), and it is in these tasks that the clearest evidence of cognitively driven\nmanual skill is shown.\nMountain gorillas need considerable manual skill to obtain adequate nutrition, because\ntheir four major foods are all plants that are “defended” physically in ways that impede\nconsumption  (Byrne, 1999b).  Thus, Laportea nettles are covered with stinging hairs; Carduus\nthistles, with spines; Peucedanum celery, with hard outer casing; and Galium bedstraw, with tiny\nhooks.  Gorillas’ techniques for dealing with these problems are complex, with several different\nactions organized into a regular sequence that is effective in removing or rendering harmless the\nvarious defences while efficient in rapidly amassing plant matter ready for eating (Byrne, Corp, &\nByrne, 2001b).\nIndividual actions show considerable precision handling and bimanual role\ndifferentiation (Byrne, et al., 2001a): for instance the deft folding and re-grasping of a whorl of\n12\nsting-covered nettle leaves, which wraps the worst stings safely inside a single leaf.  The\norganization of the tasks is not simply a chain, but a flexible hierarchy of control (Byrne &\nByrne, 1993; Byrne & Russon, 1998). Hierarchical control means that processing stages which\nare occasionally unnecessary may be omitted (e.g., cleaning off debris before eating), local\ndifficulties during the execution of a sequence can be handled by several alternative processes\n(e.g., substituting unimanual for normal bimanual accumulation of leaves, when one hand is\nneeded for support in a tree), and series of processes may be treated as a single subroutine (such\nas iteration of the processes of procuring a nettle, stripping the stem of leaves, and removing\npetioles from those leaves, to the criterion of an adequately sized handful).\nFinally, mountain gorilla manual lateralization is very strong in plant preparation.\nTechniques for consuming these four main foods are all bimanual, with left- and right-handed\nforms differing in which particular actions are done by each hand. For all four foods, almost\nevery individual in the study population of 38 showed very strong preference for either right- or\nleft-handed methods: almost none were ambidextrous (Byrne and Byrne, 1991).  Moreover, for\nprocessing both celery pith and thistle leaves, individuals with the strongest lateralization were\nthe quickest to prepare handfuls for eating: as in chimpanzees, lateralization makes for more\nefficient performance (Byrne & Byrne, 1991).  Intriguingly, a mountain gorilla seems to have two\n“hand preferences”, for leaf and stem processing respectively.  For the three very different\ntechniques by which leaves are processed, gorillas that were (say) right-handed on one task were\nalso right-handed on the other two, just as in most skilled manual tasks in humans.  However,\nknowing an individual’s laterality of leaf-processing does not in the slightest predict its (equally\nstrong) hand preference for stem-processing.  At the population level, no handedness was found\nfor stem-processing but hand preferences for each of the three leaf-processing tasks were\nsignificantly skewed.  More individuals preferred performing the most delicate actions right-\nhanded, with the left hand giving grip support (Byrne & Byrne, 1991).  The strongest bias was\nfound for Carduus thistle, 64% right-handed and individuals with an exclusive hand-preference\n(i.e. 100% for left or right) were significantly right biased (McGrew & Marchant, 1996).  This\npattern seems to be the closest to human handedness yet found in any animal: several different\ntasks each evoke strong behavioural laterality, such that individuals have the same preference for\neach, and over the population there is a significant bias towards right-handed fine manipulation\nin all of them.\nComparing the gorilla data with the cognitive skills evidenced in human tool-making,\nconspicuous absences are the lack of aimed blows (which may simply reflect lack of need) and of\ncorrective guidance based on anticipatory schema (which, as already noted, is difficult to detect).\n13\nWhat is striking is that gorilla plant-feeding without tools provides remarkably similar evidence\nof complex cognition as that provided by chimpanzee tool use and manufacture.  Indeed, but for\nwest African chimpanzees’ stone hammer and anvil use, gorillas would furnish better evidence of\ncognitive sophistication in manual skill, because hierarchical organization is more firmly\nestablished and hand-preferences at individual and population level are stronger.  This\nPan/Gorilla comparison supports a picture of the two genera as cognitively rather similar (Byrne,\n1996), rather than of the gorilla as having lost many cognitive capacities still present in the\nchimpanzee (Povinelli, 1993).\nPongo: the orangutan subspecies\nAlthough Bornean Pongo p. pygmaeus and Sumatran Pongo p. abelii orangutans differ as\nmuch genetically as the two chimpanzee species (Begun, 1999), they are usually treated as the\nsame species.  Comparing the two is complicated by the fact that their forest ecology differs\nmarkedly, at least at well-studied sites.   Bornean forests are impoverished in fruit production\ncompared to Sumatran.  In Sumatra, tigers still range and large fruiting trees occur that act as\nmagnets to orangutans.  Therefore, Sumatrans more often congregate in groups  and Borneans\nmay rely more heavily on difficult fall-back foods like bark (van Schaik et al, 1999).\nWild orangutan tool use is rare.  Individuals probe into arboreal bees’ nests with a stick\nto obtain grubs and honey; they use a stick to scrape out irritating hairs within Neesia fruit, then\nprise the edible seeds from the husk so they can be safely eaten (Fox et al., 1999).  These tool\nhabits reveal a basic difference from African apes. Whereas chimpanzees or gorillas would use\ntheir hands for the fine motor control needed in comparable tasks, orangutans often transfer the\nstick to the mouth (Fox, et al., 1999; see also O’Malley & McGrew, 2000, Russon 2002).\nOrangutan tool using  may involve precision “mouthing” more than precision “handling”.  The\nmuch greater mobility of chimpanzee lips from those of gorillas has often been remarked, but\nthe difference with orangutans is apparently even more marked.\nLike gorillas, orangutans also confront many challenging plant foods, which often\npresent multiple rather than single defences (Fox et al., 1999; Russon, 1998, 1999a, in press), and\nin addition their efforts to copy various complex human activities have been studied closely\n(Russon, 1997, 1999b; Russon & Galdikas, 1993, 1995).  These behaviours provide a rich source\nof data on manual skill.  Delicate care in visually-guided precision handling is evident: for\ninstance, when a rehabilitant poured kerosene onto smouldering embers of a fire, poured coffee\nfrom one narrow necked bottle into another, or threaded a rope through a metal ring.\nHierarchical organization of plans has also been described: for instance, attaining the (prohibited)\n14\ngoal of “washing” laundry with stolen soap entailed a whole series of actions—untying a canoe,\nrocking it side to side to remove the bilge water, punting it to the otherwise inaccessible raft\nwhere laundry and soap could be had, etc. (Byrne & Russon, 1998).  In eating meristematic tissue\nfrom the base of new Borassodendron borneensis palm leaves, free-ranging rehabilitants show a\nsystematic and hierarchically organized approach (Russon, 1998).  The long action sequence in\nthis process is evident, from constructing a clear working zone in the palm’s crown, to complex\nsubdivision and extraction of the leaf, to final departure while still eating carefully cached\nleftovers .   Orangutans often begin by lightly fingering the leaf, as if checking it; then they either\nabandon it (as if it were undesirable) or proceed to prepare a work zone to facilitate extraction;\nthey may also pause mid-sequence to correct errors or handle interruptions (Russon, pers.\ncomm.). These adjustments suggest the use of on-line corrective guidance; leaf-testing, like Mt.\nNiéniokoué chimpanzees’ nut testing, suggests correction based on anticipatory schema.  Like\ngorillas, orangutans may have little natural need for percussive tool use, but rehabilitants\nspontaneously bang termite nest chunks together to crack them open and once hammered a hole\nthrough the concrete floor of their cage with scavenged chunks of cement (Russon, 2000, pers.\ncomm.), and one captive readily learned to flake stone to produce sharp flakes (but with human\ntuition and assistance: Wright, 1972).  Most of these examples concern individuals with some\ndegree of human experience, so better confirmation from wild orangutans is desirable, but\npresent evidence indicates that orangutans show most of the cognitive attributes evident in\nAfrican great apes.\nEvidence on manual lateralization in orangutans is relatively sparse, but Rogers and\nKaplan (1996) found no population trend in hand preferences when food processing, and even\nindividual lateral preferences varied widely.  Considerable use of bimanual role differentiation in\nfeeding was found in some individuals (e.g. CID, in Fig 5 on p.21), suggesting that such motor\ncontrol is quite possible in orangutans.\nConclusions\nTable 1 offers an attempt to summarize current evidence on the cognitively driven\nmanual skills of the living great apes.  Living great apes, to summarize briefly, can use their\nconsiderable abilities of precise handling of objects and bimanual role differentiation to construct\nmotor skills that involve a regular, sequential plan of many actions, some of which are\nhierarchically organized—with resulting flexibili ty of tool and manual problem-solving in the\nphysical domain.  Characteristically, these complex skills involve lateralized processing in\nindividuals.\n15\nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE\nInevitably, these judgements have an element of subjectivity, but in general the lack of\ndifference across species is clear, especially among the African apes, as are the cognitive\nsimilarities underlying manual and tool skills. (see Yamakoshi, this volume, for consistent\nfindings using a different approach.)  Partly, this conclusion may reflect the lack of descriptive\nwork sensitive enough to characterize fine details of motor control and planning, and real\ndifferences may yet appear.  But on the aspects analysed here, it seems more likely that as\nevidence accumulates (especially from the less-studied Pongo and Gorilla) apparent differences are\nmore likely to disappear, except in so far as they reflect responses to ecological need.\nIn many ways, this suite of capacities in living apes closely resembles that inferred for\nextinct, bipedal apes on the human line (Paranthropus, Australopithecus, Homo habilis, etc.).  Other\naspects of the behaviour of living apes also suggest similarities in cognition to those extinct\nspecies.  In the elegantly flaked tools from Lokalalei, conclusive evidence of on-line guidance\nfrom comparison with a mental anticipation (schema) is apparently lacking (Roche et al, 1999).\nOnly with the visible traces of corrections during the manufacture of much later hand axes, of\nHomo erectus and subsequent species, does this become incontrovertible.  Alternatively, many\narchaeologists would argue that guidance by mental schema is strongly suggested in more ancient\nstone tool repertoires; but equally, many primatologists would argue the same from the skilled\nbehaviour of living apes.  Nothing like the 90% right handedness typical of modern human\npopulations is known in any living ape population.  However, claims of right-handed\nmanufacture of early stone tools are also controversial (Toth, 1985a).  Further, until the reasons\nfor laterality in living apes are better understood, no useful comparison can be made.  Strong\nindividual laterality is associated with increased efficiency (Gorilla: Byrne and Byrne, 1991; Pan:\nMcGrew and Marchant, 1999), but population right-handedness is at best relatively weak, and\nshown convincingly in the wild only in gorilla leaf-processing tasks (Byrne & Byrne, 1991;\nMcGrew & Marchant, 1996).\nThe question then becomes, where do the real differences in cognitive capacities lie, and are\nthese differences likely to be critical ones for human evolution?  In Table 1, chimpanzees (and,\nless conclusively, orangutans) are noted as able to aim relatively accurate and powerful blows,\nmost clearly shown by chimpanzees using stone hammers and anvils.  Hammer and anvil use is\nmuch slower to acquire than any other manual skill in any ape species (Boesch & Boesch, 1983),\nand experimental induction of stone flaking in one orangutan and one bonobo did not result in\n16\neither individual learning to strike flakes off a hand-held core.  Evidently, accurately aimed\nhitting does not come easily to living apes.  Moreover, apes’ level of accuracy is unlikely to be\nanywhere near that shown in the stone tools of Lokalalei, where there is evidence of very precise\ncontrol of force and blows to detach flakes in a regular, planned sequence.  The ability to control\nblows this precisely aimed but still powerful seems to be a crucial adaptation of the human\nlineage.  Incorporating these refined actions into an organized, planned sequential program is\nsomething that apes already do.  (It seems a suspicious coincidence that the cognitive capacity\nthat emerges as crucial happens to be almost the only one that current archaeological methods\nare capable of showing before 2Ma.  Perhaps the Lokalalei tool-makers had other skills we can\nonly guess at.)\nThese conclusions suggest that human manual skill has a relatively long evolutionary\nhistory, that can usefully be studied in living apes as well as archaeologically.  The extinct bipedal\napes of 4 Mya to 2 Mya that made stone tools were very different animals to any other living\nspecies, but the cognitive capacities of chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans are appropriately\ncompared to those of these first stone tool-makers.\nIn beginning to make such comparisons, and developing an integrated understanding of\nthe cognition that lies behind manual skills in both human and non-human apes, it is important\nthat all evidence of advanced manual skill be utilized.  My frequent and (I hope) telling uses of\ndata from plant processing show that evidence should not be sought only from skills involving\ntools.   Tool use per se has a mystique that risks distorting our perspective away from recognizing\nother manifestations of complex manual ability.  Focusing attention on the cognitive capacities\nthat skilled behaviour can indicate, whether or not tools are involved, should allow a better\nunderstanding of great ape as well as human intellectual origins.\n17\nFootnote\n1.  A single name for this group of species would be convenient, and traditionally the term was\n“hominids”: defined as extinct relatives of modern humans that were bipedal, more closely\nrelated to ourselves than to any living animal, but not quite human. Usage varied slightly in\nwhether Homo species other than sapiens were described as “hominids” or simply humans, but\ngenera like Australopithecus, Paranthropus and Ardipithecus were always referred to as (early)\nhominids.  Unfortunately, “hominid” now has at least two meanings. Modern taxonomy\nrecognizes the remarkably close relationship between humans and the living great apes (Begun,\n1999), and now includes some or all of them among the hominids.  Sometimes only the African\ngreat apes, including Homo, are included, with the Asian orangutans remaining in the family\nPongidae; sometimes all the great apes, including Homo and also Pongo, are treated as hominids.\nMeanwhile, many palaeontologists keep to the original usage. For clarity, the term is avoided in\nthis chapter.\n18\nTable 1\nPan Gorilla Pongo\nprecision handling 999\naccurately aimed, powerful blows 9 ?
