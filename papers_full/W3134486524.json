  "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is the subject of intense research in remote sensing. The tremendous success of deep learning in computer vision has recently sparked the interest in applying deep learning in hyperspectral image classification. However, most deep learning methods for hyperspectral image classification are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). Those methods require heavy GPU memory resources and run time. Recently, another deep learning model, the transformer, has been applied for image recognition, and the study result demonstrates the great potential of the transformer network for computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a model for hyperspectral image classification based on the transformer, which is widely used in natural language processing. Besides, we believe we are the first to combine the metric learning and the transformer model in hyperspectral image classification. Moreover, to improve the model classification performance when the available training samples are limited, we use the 1-D convolution and Mish activation function. The experimental results on three widely used hyperspectral image data sets demonstrate the proposed model’s advantages in accuracy, GPU memory cost, and running time.",
