  "abstract": "Educators use many methods in their classrooms to aid in teaching. One commonly used method of instruction is the use of cases as a teaching tool in IS education. Cases can allow students to develop high-order reasoning skills, bring real world examples into the classroom, allow students to learn by doing, bring organizational impacts, social values, and ethical issues to the forefront of discussion, and include realistic content, objectives and knowledge transfer. As part of its mission to support Information Systems (IS) education, JISE is pleased to publish this special issue devoted to IS teaching cases. The twelve teaching cases in this issue are divided into five IS areas. These teaching cases may be copied and used by IS faculty for any teaching purposes.",
