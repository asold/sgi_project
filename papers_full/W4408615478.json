  "abstract": "To unlock more aspects of human cognitive structuring, human–AI and human–robot interactions require increasingly advanced communication skills on both the human and robot sides. This paper compares three methods of retrieving cultural heritage information in primary school education: search engines, large language models (LLMs), and the NAO humanoid robot, which serves as a facilitator with programmed answering capabilities for convergent questions. Human–robot interaction has become a critical aspect of modern education, with robots like the NAO providing new opportunities for engaging and personalized learning experiences. The NAO, with its anthropomorphic design and ability to interact with students, presents a unique approach to fostering deeper connections with educational content, particularly in the context of cultural heritage. The paper includes an introduction, extensive literature review, methodology, research results from student questionnaires, and conclusions. The findings highlight the potential of intelligent and embodied technologies for enhancing knowledge retrieval and engagement, demonstrating the NAO’s ability to adapt to student needs and facilitate more dynamic learning interactions.",
