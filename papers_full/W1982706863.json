Fungicide treatment\n1 Introduction\nAs Meynard and Sebillotte (1989) pointed out, the design and\ndevelopment of decision support tools in agriculture has be-\ncome a major objective for agronomists. More and more tools\nare now being offered, based primarily on advances in mod-\nelling and automated data capture in the field. These tools\nincreasingly make use of the access to facilities afforded by\nthe internet. Yet, although this engineering activity (design\nand development of decision support tools) is a crucial part of\nmany agronomist-researchers' work, the improvement of de-\nsign methodologies is rarely discussed within the agronomic\ncommunity. In fact, even though numerous papers have been\npublished about decision support systems (3,806 papers over a\nM. Cerf (*) : L.

(2012) 32:899–910\nDOI 10.1007/s13593-012-0091-z\n\n40-year period, according to the results of a search proce-\ndure run in the CABI database with the TOPIC request\n‘decision support system*’), few focus on describing and\ndiscussing design methodologies. The papers which discuss\nthese aspects are often those which question the lack of use\nof the so-called ‘decision support tools’ by farmers, advi-\nsors or policymakers (see Boote et al. 1996;C o x1996;\nHammer et al. 2002;M a t t h e w se ta l .2002;M c C o w na n d\nParton 2006, and Woodward et al.2008). To explain the\nlow level of use of decision support tools, these authors\nhave often mentioned the contrast between the model of-\nfered and the way farmers make decisions, which has\nmostly led them to advocate participatory design methods\n(McCown 2002;C a r b e r r ye ta l .2002;B r e u e re ta l .2008;\nJakku and Thorburn2010). Participation has become a very\nfashionable term. As Pretty pointed out several years ago\n(Pretty1995), ‘the term“people's participation” [is] now part\nof the normal language of many development agencies, includ-\ning nongovernment organizations, government departments\nand banks [… ]. It is such a fashion that almost everyone says\nthat participation is part of their work. This has created many\nparadoxes. [… ]. More often than not, people are asked or\ndragged into partaking in operations of no interest to them, in\nthe very name of participation’. The vision of participation that\nwe advocate here would match the one described by McCown\n(2001) suggesting the need for a shift from‘a design paradigm\nto one featuringdialogue in order to construct relevance to\npractice’. But in this paper, we additionally insist on the fact\nthat dialogue is required not only to put a model into use in a\ndecision support system, but also to design the model itself. We\ntherefore propose that such participatory design be called a\ndialogical design process, and suggest some methodological\ninsights on such a process.\nOur dialogical design methodology was developed from\ntwo participatory projects on agronomic decision support\ntools. This methodology emphasizes two main stages: the\ndiagnosis of uses and the setting up of an arrangement\nbetween designers and users based on the use of a prototype.\nWe first present the two design projects from which we\ndeveloped our methodology, and the two stages of this\nmethodology. We then describe the outcomes of both stages.\nBefore concluding, we open the discussion on some more\ngeneric considerations about design methodology and pro-\npose that the design of decision support in agriculture be\nbased on the challenging of three main dimensions which\nare intertwined in the design process: (1) a newconcept to\ndevelop (i.e. the first idea for a tool to be designed), (2)\nknowledge, notably scientific, to be incorporated into the\ntool, which already exists or has yet to be produced, and (3)\nwork situationsin which the tool may or may not find a use.\nWe then discuss the idea that dialogical design is aimed at\ncreating learning environments for both practitioners and\nscientists.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 Agronomic tools designed in the two projects\nOur two examples concern the design of decision support tools\nintended to promote more environmentally friendly agriculture.\nThe first, which we worked on from 2000 to 2004, aimed to\navoid applying unnecessary fungicide treatments for sclerotinia\non oilseed rape. To develop more environmentally friendly\npractices as regards crop disease control, CETIOM (French\ntechnical institute for the development of oil crops) decided\nin the 1990s to design a decision support system to avoid\nroutine treatments for sclerotinia (sclerotinia sclerotiorum\n(lib.) de Bary) in oilseed rape. Whereas the disease significantly\naffects yields only 2 years out of 10 on average in France\n(Penaud and Kazmar2001), most farmers spray routinely in\nregions where rape is frequent in the rotation. The objective of\nthe new decision support system was to allow advisors or\nfarmers to evaluate infection in the field at an early stage, before\nthe effects of the disease were noticeable, and thus to identify\nsituations where the treatment could be avoided. When our\nstudy began in 2000, different tools were being designed\nsimultaneously to respond to this need: an evaluation table of\nrisks in the field, based on information on the cropping systems\n(Taverne et al.2001); a‘petal kit’measuring the percentage of\ninfected flowers by incubating a sample of flowers in a Petri\ndish (Cacérès et al.2001; Taverne et al.2003); and agro-\nclimatic simulation models of the infection of rape by scleroti-\nnia (Taverne 2001). Only the kit was tested beforehand in\nexperimental conditions.\nThe second project, which we studied from 2003 to 2008,\nwas designed to characterize winter wheat cultivars in order to\nidentify those best suited to different agronomic situations.\nAfter being aimed mainly at increasing yields, plant breeding\nfor winter wheat in France now includes other factors such as\ngrain quality and disease tolerance (Lonnet1997). Perfor-\nmance regarding these factors is required for a cultivar to be\nofficially registered and commercialized. This registration is\nbased on experimental data from a national network of trials\ncoordinated by the GEVES (study group for cultivars and\nseeds). Other experimental networks exist, set up by the\nbreeders or the R&D bodies, to give advice on the cultivars\nto choose and how to grow them. To make the most of such\nnetworks of cultivar trials and to better define cultivar toler-\nance to certain limiting factors (nitrogen deficiency, water and\nheat stress, diseases, etc.), agronomists proposed a model\nbased on yield gap analysis. This model reveals the limiting\nfactors found in a given network. It then assesses the tolerance\nto these limiting factors of the different cultivars in the net-\nwork (Lecomte et al.2010), by analysing the differences in\nbehaviour of the cultivars from one trial site to another, due to\ngenotype–environment interactions (GEI) (Brancourt-Hulmel\net al.1999). At the beginning of our work on that project, a\n900 M. Cerf et al.\n\nstatistical model using input variables to be collected on the\nnetworks had been built and validated on several datasets. The\ndesigners planned to implement this model so that it could\nbecome a tool used by plant breeders, specialists in charge of\ncultivar registration and advisors, to characterize the cultivars\nbetter and to integrate GEI more fully into the assessment of\ncultivar performance.\nIn both projects, the researchers were aware that the repre-\nsentations of the biophysical situations they had elicited in the\nmodel they had built may differ from the representations that\nthe practitioners would have to handle in these situations.\nThey were likewise aware that tools introducing new infor-\nmation and new ways to assess this information would have to\nfit with current decision processes and with the purposeful and\ncollective activity for which they were to be used. They\ntherefore decided to develop rough prototypes whose interface\nor even underlying model could be reworked.\n2.2 Methodology to take account of uses when designing\nagronomic support tools\nOur methodology emphasizes two main stages: the diagno-\nsis of uses and the setting up of an arrangement between\ndesigners and users based on the use of a prototype.\n2.2.1 First stage: the diagnosis of uses to analyse\nthe users' work situations and the uses of existing tools\nMany prototyping approaches start the design process with a\ndiagnosis in order to formulate the requirements better, mainly\nfor the design of cropping or livestock systems (e.g. Dogliotti et\nal. 2003; Stoorvogel et al.2004). This is usually anagronomic\ndiagnosis which identifies the diversity of cropping or hus-\nbandry practices and relates them to the performance obtained\n(e.g., yield, qualitative variables, environmental impacts). The\naim of this diagnosis is to detect the causes of failure to reach\nthe expected performance (Doré et al.2008); it may also\nsuggest solutions. We suggest that such a diagnosis be com-\npleted by a‘diagnosis of uses’on the way the decision tools are\napplied in various work situations. This has two objectives. The\nfirst is to identify the diversity of situations in which the tools\nwill help to solve a problem (e.g. to control a rape disease or to\nidentify useful characteristics for new cultivars). The situation,\nas we understand it, includes: (1) the way potential users take\ntheir decisions when faced with a problem; (2) the constraints\n(technical, organizational, etc.) they may face when implement-\ning solutions to this problem; (3) their own representation and\ninterpretation of the biophysical processes and of their action\non it. The second objective is to characterize better the uses that\npotential users make of the existing tools for taking such\ndecisions. We try to identify how the users have fitted the\nexisting tools into their decision and action processes, how\nthe new tool will complement or replace these tools, and what\nshould be modified to render this process more effective from\nthe users' points of view. Note that when the Sclerotinia design\nproject started, neither farmers nor advisors had tools to make\ndecisions on treatments. We have therefore set out to under-\nstand the ways in which farmers and advisors operate on\nrelatively similar problems, by studying how they use manage-\nment tools to decide on treatments for wheat diseases.\nThis diagnosis of uses was built from semi-structured inter-\nviews with potential users of the tools under design (see Fig.1\nfor details, as well as Lecomte et al.2010 and Taverne and\nCerf 2009). To characterize the diversity of uses of existing\ntools in our two design projects, we proposed three comple-\nmentary points of view. The first iscognitive. It characterizes\nthe diversity of ways of representing the agronomic problem.\nThe second one concerns the diversity of ways in which the\ntools are used to take decisions. It is afunctional point of view\nwhich combines the‘why’we use the tool with the‘how’we\nproduce reliable and useful information with it. The third point\nof view allows us to take account of the constraints which the\nactors may experience in using the tools efficiently. Might\nthese constraints influence the way the tool is used in a\ncompatible way with its validity domain, or not? We call this\nan operational point of view. These three points of view\nenrich the way agronomists look at users, as they rarely take\non board the cognitive dimension.\n2.2.2 Second stage: setting up an arrangement around\na prototype to put into motion the concept, the knowledge\nand the users' work situations\nThe second stage of our methodology aims at building\ninteractions with users around prototype tools, based on\nthe characteristics of their work situations and the assump-\ntions about how they could use the tools, identified during\nthe diagnosis. The challenge is to set up an arrangement\nwhich may set in motion the knowledge contained in the\ntool, the problems likely to be resolved by using it, and the\nways of making decisions or a diagnosis. The arrangement\nshould bring to light what may appear to be impossible or\nincomprehensible during the use of the tool in work situa-\ntions. Successive loops might be required to settle agree-\nments about: (1) the way to describe and to interpret the\n‘real world’at least in the working situations of the potential\nusers, and (2) the concept and the way of making it opera-\ntional through a coupling between the tool and its users'\nwork situations. The setting up of the designers–users ar-\nrangement was based on two inseparable stages in our two\ndesign projects: the handling of the tool by the users in\nwork-like situations, and the‘debriefing’.\n– The handling is based on the idea of putting the users\ninto a realistic work situation in which the prototype\nmay be used. At this stage, the designers have to solve\nParticipatory design of agricultural decision support tools 901\n\nthe tension between developing a prototype that is com-\nplete enough to be manipulated easily, and keeping options\nopen enough. In our two design projects, usable prototypes\nthen had to be built (Fig.1). The validity of their outputs\nwas however not sufficient for them to be used in real-\nwork situations, although it would have improved the\nprocess to be able to observe a few such situations. The\nobservation cannot be representative, but should enable\ndesigners to grasp more fully how users apply the tools\nand what they say about them during the debriefings.\nCollective and individual sessions for handling the proto-\ntype, according to different scenarios of work situations,\nwere then organized in our two design projects.\nIn the case of sclerotinia, users did not all handle the\nprototypes in the same way. Advisors from two regions\nwith different rotations and treatment practices used the\nprototype kit and table (for details, see Fig.1)w h e nr a p e\nwas flowering (stage G2) and before it was necessary to\ndecide on fungicide treatments. Kits were not provided to\nfarmers, but at meetings we showed them the kit and\nphotos of its use, and explained how it was used, from\nthe gathering of petals to the analysis of the results. The\ntable was filled in during this meeting as well. In the focus\ngroups, discussions were organized around various sce-\nnarios which each combined the stages of collection and\ntreatment of data differently. The scenarios included var-\nious contexts of use, emphasizing most particularly the\ndynamics of infection and the effect of using products of\nvarying costs to treat the crop. These methods of handling\naimed at: (1) including the diversity of users and agro-\nnomic conditions during this stage; (2) bringing to light\nthe organizational conditions to guarantee the interpreta-\ntion of the results from the kit and provide timely advice\nto rule out the idea of treating; (3) allowing the users to\nassess the validity of the kit in conditions which differ\nfrom those for which its reliability had already been\nevaluated, and (4) weighting criteria (price of treatments,\neffects on the environment and on yield) in order to reveal\nthe dependence of the intervention threshold on various\ncombinations of these criteria.\nFig. 1 Details about our two design projects: description of the work context, of the tools and of the methods used for each of the two stages. At the\ntop, cultivar assessment design project; at thebottom, sclerotinia treatment design project\n902 M. Cerf et al.\n\nIn the case of cultivar assessment, the Diagvar proto-\ntype computer program was tried out by three groups of\npeople (a group of plant breeders from four different firms,\none of the advisors from the French R&D institute for\ncereals, and one of the specialists of cultivar registration;\nsee Fig.1), during a quiet period for those involved, and\nnot at the actual time when cultivars have to be evaluated.\nTo stick as much as possible to their work situations, we\nproposed that the users experience the tool on a range of\ntheir own recent datasets, over a 1- to 3-week period. We\nasked those involved to choose, within this dataset, the\ncombination of trials for which they wanted to do a\ndiagnosis. We then could discuss whether the tool yielded\nresults consistent with the limiting factors identified by the\nusers in the trials on the basis of their own expertise. We\nalso discussed the diversity of configurations which inter-\nested them and how this might influence the stability of\nthe results provided by the tool.\nThe work of handling the tools in the two projects was\nusually done on an individual basis (one prototype per\nperson), although a prior group stage was organized to\npresent the prototypes and explain that the aim was to go\nback over its characteristics, be they cognitive, functional\nor operational. The work on the scenarios combining\ndifferent actors in the sclerotinia case was organized in\ngroups (a group of farmers only, farmers together with\nadvisors, and advisors alone; see Fig.1) as it aimed to\ndiscuss the organizational assumptions and to find out\nwhat was possible or unacceptable\n– The debriefing allows the participants to go back over\nwhat they have done with the tool, what they did not\nsucceed in doing, and what they would have liked to have\ndone. It consists in looking back, mainly collectively, on\nthe way the prototype has been used, the information it has\ngiven and its relevance, the difficulties of its use, and its\nadvantages. It may deal with results the users did not\nunderstand, discrepancies between diagnoses made with\nthe tool and those they would have made without it, etc.\nDue to the diversity of users and the places and times in\nwhich they operated, we were unable to observe directly\nwhat they did with the prototypes. They were therefore\nasked to note down their achievements in this respect, or\nt h ec a u s e so fd i f f i c u l t i e so re r r o r s .H o w e v e r ,t h eu s e r s\ngenerally did not have time to note down such informa-\ntion. We therefore organized debriefing sessions, making\nthe best of whatever records the users did have concerning\nthe prototype and whatever they were able to remember.\nFor sclerotinia, the petal kit was used by a large number\nof participants (50, Fig.1). The debriefing on use of the kit\nand the table was done on an individual basis. We tried to\nfind out what had been done with them, and to explore the\nproblems that the users had been able to identify when\ntrying them out. This exploration was done during an\ninterview organized to discuss the tools and their use from\nthe cognitive, functional and operational points of view.\nFinally, the interview ended with a discussion on changes\nthat could be made to resolve the problems identified. In the\nwork with focus groups the prototype was not really used,\nand the discussion revolved around scenarios, often with a\ncombination of simulation and evaluation of the scenarios.\nFor the cultivar assessment tool, the debriefing was\norganized by forming groups of users working together\nbut possibly having different occupations (for example a\nplant breeder and a head of cultivar development in a plant\nbreeding firm). During the debriefings, they went over the\nproblems they had encountered with the various datasets\nthey chose to analyse with the prototype tool Diagvar.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 First stage: a way to devise new concepts for tools and to\nwork on the flexibility required in the tools\n3.1.1 Characteristics of the use situations\nAs explained in the preceding section, we used three comple-\nmentary points of view to characterize the diversity of situa-\ntions in which the tools may help to solve a problem, and the\nuses of existing tools in these situations. Table1 shows these\nthree points of view within each project. The study of the\ncognitive point of view shows significant differences between\ndesigners' and users' representations of the problem. For in-\nstance, in the case of sclerotinia, whereas the agronomists are\ninterested in the frequency of occurrence of a severe attack\n(justifying a treatment), the farmers (‘users’) are mostly inter-\nested in avoiding situations resulting in such an attack. From a\nfunctional point of view, there is a diversity of aims and ways of\nproducing information: for instance, in the case of cultivar\nassessment, the users distinguished different aims (registering,\nbreeding, developing, range designing, indexing and scoring\ntechnological suitability), corresponding to different types of\ntrial networks (see Lecomte et al.2010). Finally, the operational\npoint of view highlights the deepconstraints to action experi-\nenced by each actor. In the case of sclerotinia, the farmers have\nto treat before the appearance of the disease, which means that\nfarmers and advisors have littletime for gathering information.\nIn the case of cultivar assessment, the actors have little time to\ncollect useful data and to process the data from the trials.\n3.1.2 The diagnosis of uses: a way to develop new concepts\nfor tools\nThe diagnosis of uses can help in devising new concepts for\ntools, by revealing ways of using existing tools, not envisaged\nParticipatory design of agricultural decision support tools 903\n\nin their design, or by identifying problems peculiar to the users\nwhich will modify the original concept of the tool under\ndesign. Thus, in the case of sclerotinia, farmers and advisors\noften combine the available tools to evaluate the risk of\ninfection over the course of time, by means of a rather sophis-\nticated arrangement described by Cerf and Meynard (2006).\nThese authors have developed the concept of Information and\nAdvice Systems (IAS) to account for this arrangement bet-\nween tools, advisors and farmers. Likewise, the difference in\nthe perception of the risk, as well as the designers' wish to\nfavour low-input agriculture, led some designers involved in\nthe sclerotinia project to consider the possibility of coupling\nan insurance device to the evaluation of the level of infection\nby the petal kit, and thus to develop a new concept for a tool to\nlimit the fungicide treatments.\nIn the second case study, discussions about the function-\nality of the tool brought to light a major challenge for those\ninvolved in the assessment of new cultivars: the cost of the\nnetworks and the advantage of reducing the number of trials.\nThis appeared to be possible once more information could\nbe extracted from each of the trials. Thus the tool was to\nfacilitate the optimization of the networks. The diagnosis of\nlimiting factors, by means of the tool, was used to identify\nthe trial sites which were redundant because they had the\nsame limiting factors and thus resulted in the same cultivar\nrankings.\n3.1.3 Integrating the diversity of uses: what flexibility\nto introduce into the tool?\nAcknowledging diversity among the cognitive, functional\nand operational points of view is important to foster discus-\nsions among the participants on the agricultural paradigm\nand on the use and user models on which the tool is based.\nThis raises questions on the flexibility required in the tool.\n‘Flexible’ here means that the tool produces information\nwhich will be relevant and reliable for a range of decision\ncontexts and operating methods.\nHence, in the case of sclerotinia, in order to discuss the\neffect of different agricultural paradigms on the threshold\nfor deciding to spray, we borrowed and adapted some meth-\nods from the world of medicine (see Makowski et al.2005).\nTable 1 Cognitive, functional and operational points of view in the two design projects\nCase study Sclerotinia treatment Cultivar assessment (Diagvar)\nCognitive point of view: diversity\nof representations of the problem\nbetween designers and users\nUsers: The risk of a severe attack of sclerotinia is\nassessed in relation to the absence of a curative\ntreatment, the severity of the damage, and the low\ncost of the current fungicide (carbendazime)→the\nquestion for the users is not the frequency of\noccurrence of a severe attack but rather avoiding\nsituations resulting in such an attack.\nUsers: Most commonly, they aim to find a versatile\ngenotype, on a scale ranging from regional to\nnational level or even beyond. Some users aim to\nfind a genotype which renews the available range\nof cultivars (quality and earliness).\nUsers treat the data by comparing the trials in pairs:\nno analysis of the overall data on the network\nscale.\nAgronomists: The tools targeted the treatment of\nsclerotinia and do not include the possibility of\ncomplex pathogens. The risk is assessed by the\nfrequency of occurrence of an attack to justify\ntreatment.\nAgronomists: They work on a network scale to\nextract information on the limiting factors. To\nassess the adaptation of the genotype to the\nenvironment, they try to analyse the GEI within\nthe overall network.\nFunctional point of view: diversity\nof aims and ways of producing\ninformation\nIn the case of wheat, the users combine different\ntools to identify the years, the regions and the\nfields at risk.\nSix different work assessment objectives were\nidentified: registering, breeding, developing, range\ndesigning, indexing and scoring technological\nsuitability\nTo provide advice on the scale of a small region,\nadvisors use the tools designed to support\ntreatment decisions on the field scale. Some\nfarmers use the management tools only when\nfaced with unusual situations (see Cerf and\nMeynard 2006)\nNine types of cultivar trial networks were identified:\nregistration, start/end of breeding process,\nindexing of company's new breeds, commercial\ndevelopment, seed producers, market development\nindexing, technical indexing and milling. (see\nLecomte et al.2010)\nOperational point of view: main\nconstraints to action\nFarmers: In the absence of a curative treatment, they\nhave to treat before the appearance of the disease.\nMost farmers do not want to spend too much time\ngathering information.\nAll the actors face strong organizational constraints:\n(1) to collect useful data for the interpretation of\nlimiting factors in a network, (2) to process the\ndata from the trials. This must be done in the\nperiod from harvest to next sowing.Advisors: They work on a network of fields (tens of\nkm\n2) and have little time for gathering\ninformation.\n904 M. Cerf et al.\n\nThe idea was to allow users to evaluate more efficiently the\nquality of different indicators (the one provided by the petal\nkit, the one which combines the decision grid with the petal\nkit, etc.) regarding the effects of the disease on the yield,\naccording to the decision rule for fungicide application. The\nchoice of the decision rule also determined how to treat the\nrisks of type 1 and type 2 errors in the interpretation of an\nindicator of the occurrence of the disease in the field (the\nincidence of infected flowers). The designers first and fore-\nmost wanted the tool to allow for a reduction in the frequency\nof treatments (accordingly, they tried to give priority to reduc-\ning type 2 errors‘to treat even if in the end it turns out to be\nunnecessary’), whereas the farmers were particularly anxious\nnot to risk having the disease (thus giving priority to reducing\ntype 1 errors, i.e.‘not treating even if it would have been\nnecessary to do so’). Being flexible here means getting round\nthis difference while nevertheless keeping the key idea of\navoiding unnecessary treatments.\nIn the case of the assessment of winter wheat cultivars,\nflexibility first had to address the operational diversity among\nfuture users. For example, the future users did not all collect the\nsame data on the trials: some collected weather data and data on\ndevelopmental stages, while others did not. Some data might\nmoreover be incomplete, or the precision might not always be\nthe same because of the organizational constraints of those\ndoing the assessment. For example, for a growth stage record,\nsome tried to locate the precise day of appearance of the stage\nwhereas others went past on a given day and noted the stage\nreached for each cultivar. The designers thus envisaged the\npossibility of making up for the absence of measured data on\nthe trial networks by introducingqualitative data obtained while\nthe assessors were visiting the trials. Flexibility also had to\naddress functional and cognitive diversity among users and\ndesigners. The range of objectives identified (Lecomte et al.\n2010) questioned the outputs which might be presented to the\nusers, and their precision (functional diversity). In fact, the\nprecision required was not the same if the aim was to exclude\nthe worst genotypes or to rank all the tested genotypes correctly.\nRelevant and significant information differed among the users,\nand the tool should have allowed this diversity to be taken into\naccount. It also had to take on board the fact that most users\ntried to identify cultivars which were stable over a range of\nenvironments (which means giving priority to economic con-\nsiderations), even though the tool was originally designed to\nidentify cultivars that were suited to certain environments with\nwell-known characteristics. This discrepancy on the way to\nacknowledge GIE should therefore be discussed.\n3.2 Second stage: a prototype mediating dialogue\nbetween designers and users\nDialogue around the prototype took place in different ways.\nFirst, as Schön (1983) also found, while using the prototype\nthe potential users dialogued with their working situations.\nSuch dialogue enabled them to formulate claims which they\nwould then address to the designers. Such claims were based\non their experiencing the tool as well as its ability to overcome\nsome of the problems they wanted to solve. This experience\nwas then used by the designers to question the model, the tool\nand the user's decision making and practices during the\ndebriefing sessions. Dialogue was thus established not only\namongst the designers and the users (Hatchuel1996) but also\nmore generally between humans, artefacts and situations.\nDebriefing sessions create learning environments in which\ndialogue is supported by the way the prototype responds to\nthe use made of it in work-like situations: what the tool can or\ncannot do for the users, the capabilities which the users ascribe\nto it, the difficulties encountered in understanding what the\noutput means, and finally the difficulties in obtaining the input\ndata for the tool. During the debriefings, users related the\nproblems they had encountered and the solutions they had\ndevised to solve them, when possible. They also spoke about\ntheir discoveries, and the way they started to change their\nviews on how to go about decision making (the information\non which they grounded their decisions, the usefulness of new\ninformation). It is therefore important for the designers to\naccept the fact that the knowledge introduced into the tool,\nthe capabilities which they envisage, and the ways of using the\ntool will be reviewed, and that a new version of the prototype\nshould be developed.\nDebriefings are opportunities to capture discrepancies in\nthe way participants build a representation of the problem\n(collect and interpret information) and their appraisal of the\nuncertainty they face in solving this problem. In the case of\ncultivar assessment, for instance, the users pointed out prob-\nlems in the choice of indicators for limiting factors, in the\nprecision needed for the input data, in the factors that the\ntool sorts out as limiting yield in the network, in the inten-\nsity they attributed to these factors, etc. In doing so, they\ndiscussed the assumptions made in the agronomic model\nunderlying the tool. This was also an opportunity for the\ndesigners to point out the limitations of working on a dataset\nwhich is too homogeneous (variability is needed in the\nintensity of the limiting factors on a network scale if they\nare to be located).\nThe exploitation of the debriefings then enabled the partic-\nipants to identify what should, or could, be initiated as regards\nboth the tool and the users' practices. This was done by\neliciting the cognitive, functional and operational points of\nview to which the discussions during the debriefing sessions\nrefer.\nFor sclerotinia and from afunctional point of view, the\ndebriefing showed that the challenges of using tools in a local\nnetwork, for combining the results in a range of agronomic\nsituations, was not yet clear for the potential users, although\nthey usually knew‘how it works\n’(Cerf and Meynard2006).\nParticipatory design of agricultural decision support tools 905\n\nBut anticipating the way such a network can operate remained\na difficult task. From acognitive point of view, the debriefing\nalso allowed us to point out the lack of reliable knowledge on\nthe protocols for testing the tool on the scale of a small region.\nLikewise, it was an opportunity for lending support to design\nconcepts which had already emerged during the diagnosis of\nuses (insurance scheme, Information and Advice System\n(IAS)), and led to the identification of a new design concept,\ni.e. ‘an indicator for better timing of treatment in relation to\nlate infections’. It enabled the designers to further elaborate on\nthe design concepts which had been experienced during the\nprototype use (for example redesign the kit use protocol).\nFrom the operational point of view, proposals emerged to\nfacilitate the data collection (how to place the petals on the\nculture medium for example) or to interpret the results of the\nkit (photos to create a reference for classifying the colours\nobserved in the Petri dishes). On the other hand, little emerged\nabout what might change as regards the farming practices. In\nfact, the farmers lacked confidence in the results of the kit in\nrelation to the risk they thought they were taking when skip-\nping a treatment. As a result, they did not commit themselves\nas to whether they would be willing to change their farming\npractices, and discussions mainly focused on how risk was\nassessed differently among the participants.\nFor the cultivar testing computer program and from a\ncognitive point of view, the debriefing indicated numerous\nproblems calling for knowledge development (see Table2)\nbut only two of them were taken into account in a new\nversion of the tool (for details see Prost and Jeuffroy2007;\nProst et al. 2008). Indeed, compromises had to be found\nhere between improving the model underlying the tool and\nallowing the users to benefit from it while being aware of its\npossible shortcomings. From afunctional point of view, the\nusers confirmed the value of the diagnostic stage as such, as\nan opportunity to optimize the network and not just a step-\nping stone to testing the tolerance of cultivars to limiting\nfactors. From an operational point of view, changes were\nsuggested by the potential users, such as modifying their\nexperimental protocols to assess certain data not currently\nmeasured, or improving their expertise (through training or\nby hiring specialists in statistics and modelling). Moreover,\nthey asked for a change in the user interface so that they\ncould go back over the calculations of indicators of the\nintensity of limiting factors and the thresholds defined, in\norder to assess the limitations expressed by these indicators.\nWith hindsight, the collective nature of the debriefing\nappeared to have several advantages First, the users definitely\nfelt more legitimate in questioning the designers and discussing\nthe knowledge and hypotheses embedded in the tool. Second,\nin discovering what others have done or intend to do, the users\nquestioned much more critically their own way of using the\ntool. Finally, the questions asked helped users to explore what\nothers have done. The debriefing was also a way of discussing\nwhat should be taken into account for the prototype to evolve or\nwhat should be done to change the users' own situations.\n3.3 Changes in the tools and current state\nTable 2 summarizes the changes made to the tools after the\nanalysis of the users' work situations and after the users had\nTable 2 Changes in the tools and knowledge explored following the use of prototypes\nCase study Sclerotinia treatment Cultivar assessment (Diagvar)\nChanges in the tools after having\nanalysed the users' work situations\nand after the use of the prototypes\nChanges in sampling methods and in the\nergonomics of the kit.

Cerf et al.\n\nused prototypes of the tools. It also shows how this process\nenabled the researchers to identify the need to extend scientific\nknowledge. Note that some choices made to include the users'\nproposals in a new version of the tool or in the users' working\nenvironment were to some extent opportunistic taking account\nof the time scale of the project, the cost of achieving a\nsolution, our ability to mobilize other researchers skilled in\nthe new fields identified, etc. Nevertheless, we kept track of\nthe users' suggestions and of the scientific questions that the\ndebriefings raised.\nTo end this section, we briefly report on the way these\ndecision support tools are now in use. In 2008, in the case of\nsclerotinia, an operational kit for use in a network (vigicolza)\nwas developed by CETIOM (Penaud and Duroueix2009). It is\nnow used extensively throughout France, by advisors mainly.\nIn the case of Diagvar, a new prototype integrating modifica-\ntions to the input data, new statistical methods and a new\ninterface, was implemented in 2009. In 2010, it was tested on\nexisting databases by the potential users in interaction with the\ndesigners, and in 2011 by the potential users alone (the design-\ners only interacted afterwards, to obtain feedback). It is\nexpected to be applied in‘real-work’situations on the 2012\nharvest. The four plant breeding firms are still involved, as well\nas the agency in charge of cultivar registration and INRA's\nbreeders. Convinced by the results of the first tests of Diagvar\non winter wheat, they have begun its adaptation to other\nspecies (sugar beet, potatoes, peas and maize). The software\nhas been developed using an open-source language so that\ninterested parties can take over the formalisms of the tool and\nadapt them to their own situation and experimental databases.\n4 Taking it further: lessons for design\n4.1 Dialogical design is compulsory to incorporate new\ntheories of action in the redesign of agricultural practices\nWhen practices are to be redesigned to face new challenges\nwhich cannot be addressed with the incumbent theory of\naction, decision support will be grounded in new principles\nwhich can result in new theories of action. We suggest that\ndialogical design of such decision tools will create opportu-\nnities for the users to start developing such new theories of\naction, and for designers to better identify the support that\nthe tool can afford in making decisions based on new\nprinciples. In the case of sclerotinia control, deciding not\nto treat, due to environmental impacts, leads to a change of\nthe guiding principles. The learning environments created\naround the use of the prototype offered opportunities to\nidentify the obstacles to be overcome by users when devel-\noping the new practice, and the way the decision support\ntool could be included within the new work situation.\nParticipatory design has for a long time advocated for the\nusers' legitimacy to decide on an achievable and relevant\nlevel of change. Here, the design process is meant to also\nrecognize users' theories of action and the knowledge they\nhave built to make sense of the ‘real world’ in order to\nachieve their objectives and goals. We therefore propose to\ncall it a dialogical design, to recognize the need to create\nmulti-level dialogue amongst various practitioners around a\nprototype, as well as dialogue between these practitioners,\nthe prototype and the work situations, as shown by Schön\n(1983). A dialogical design methodology is intended to\naddress the following questions: ‘have we made realistic\nassumptions about the way potential users make their deci-\nsions nowadays when faced with the type of decision that\nthe tool should support? To what extent is the underlying\nagricultural paradigm shared among designers and users?\nHow can the tool improve users' ability to take effective\ndecisions? How will this tool be used, and to what extent\nwill this use be compatible with the conditions of its valid-\nity? Will the tool fit in with existing procedures, or will it\nreplace them?’Our methodology involving two key stages\nis an attempt to answer these questions.\nBased on our work in the two design projects, we address\nthese questions via the diagnosis of uses which highlights\nvarious uses requiring flexibility if the tool is to be adapted\nto them. The second stage affords the opportunity for\ndesigners and users to discuss the agricultural paradigm, as\nwell as the use and user models embedded in the prototype.\n4.2 Use of a prototype to foster a dialogical design process\nConstructing prototypes in collaboration with users and\ntesting them so that they evolve already exists in agronomy,\nfor the design of cropping and farming systems (Vereijken\n1997; Langeveld et al.2005; Mischler et al.2009; Oenema\net al. 2001). Nevertheless, the attention we give to users'\nwork situations, regarding not only their soil and weather\nconditions and the technical operations applied, but also the\ncognitive, functional and operational points of view, is im-\nportant if we are to take account of uses and users in the\ndesign process. This raises questions on some characteristics\nof the prototype and the way to create work-like situations.\nThe first point concerns the development of the tool. As the\nprototype approaches the final version, it is difficult for the\ndesigner to backtrack, due to the costs and time invested. On\nthe other hand, exploring the most operational aspects with a\nhighly conceptual artefact (for example a non-implemented\nmodel of agronomic diagnosis in the cultivar trials) is diffi-\ncult. In our two examples it was the exploration of the\noperational point of view, by directly using the kit or the\nDiagvar software, which initiated creativity at the functional\nor cognitive levels and led the participants to explore new\nfunctionalities, new problems to solve and the concepts\nParticipatory design of agricultural decision support tools 907\n\nwhich could contribute to this. The second point deals with\nthe flexibility to give to a tool, starting with the prototype.\nSince the design continues into use, the tool created will\nnecessarily be transformed by the user. The designer thus\nhas to devise systems which are sufficiently flexible so that\ntheir use allows room for manoeuvre (Béguin2007). In this\nsearch for flexibility, there is a paradox: the designer must\nproduce a tangible and practical tool but also a flexible one.\nTaking into account users' work situations and their diver-\nsity through a diagnostic of use situations and through the\nuse of a prototype is a way of equipping oneself to create\nthis flexibility in the design process. This helps to reduce the\nsearch for flexibility to an acceptable level for the design as\nit specifies boundaries to action, as suggested by Vicente\n(1999). In most agronomic engineering activity, diagnosis is\nintended to identify the diversity which has to be considered\n(e.g. Meynard1988; Tittonell et al.2009), sometimes struc-\ntured in typologies. Here, we propose that this diversity\nshould be organized not only by the soil, weather and\ntechnical factors normally taken into account by agrono-\nmists, but also by the cognitive, functional and operational\npoints of view associated with the use of tools. This suggests\nhow the flexibility of the tool could be limited accordingly,\nto avoid uses which are not compatible with the model\nembedded in the tool.\n4.3 Design as an interacting process between concepts,\nknowledge and users' work situations\nOn the basis of numerous studies carried out in R & D depart-\nments of industrial firms, Hatchuel and Weil (2009)s u g g e s t\nthat design is a key contribution in the process of creating\nknowledge. They argue that design requires a particular form\nof reasoning organized around the interaction between two\nspaces: that of the concept (C), which is the idea of the\ninnovation to be designed, and that of the knowledge (K)\nneeded to design and specify the concept. According to them,\nthe design process aims at enabling a coordinated expansion\nof these two spaces, e.g. enabling the gradual specification of\nthe concept (or the exploration of new concepts) thanks to\navailable knowledge and to new knowledge acquisition and\nuse. In their work, the knowledge space includes both scien-\ntific knowledge and users' knowledge about their work sit-\nuations. It does not pay attention to the well-known fact that\nthe relevance and significance of a description of a situation\non which one has to act can differ between scientists and\npractitioners, as many researchers have already pointed out\n(see for example Cerf and Meynard2006;H u b e r te ta l .2009;\nMcCown 2001). Moreover, it underestimates, from our point\nof view, the tangible aspects of the concept, the knowledge\nand the decision-making processes. Therefore, as part of our\nreflection on agronomic engineering, we propose to elaborate\non their proposal by redefining the C and K spaces and by\ndistinguishing a third space, which we call the U space (for\nuse space). For us, the C space is that of the concept, under-\nstood as an idea but also as a prototype which is the tangible\npart of the concept and which can be handled. The K space is\nthat of the scientific and technical knowledge which is built\nand aggregated through tangible research practices (for in-\nstance, modelling or conducting experiments or interviews).\nAnd finally, the U space gives account of users' knowledge. It\nincludes their theories of action and their decision-making\nprocesses, as well as their tangible work situations. Separating\nthe U space from the K and C spaces is a way to make explicit\nthe necessity of dialogue among various practitioners (includ-\ning the researchers who design decision support systems) on\nwhat is relevant and significant for acting in the situation, as\nMcCown (2001) has already suggested. Moreover, recogniz-\ning the tangibility of each space is a way to make explicit the\nneed to ground the dialogue in tangible working situations\nrather than handling it only at a discursive level. The purpose\nof our methodology is therefore to create learning environ-\nments in which the discrepancies between the theories of\naction of users and designers are made explicit through the\nhandling of the prototype in work-like situations. We show\nthat this way of organizing the dialogue has the result of\nexpanding the concept of design and enabling further devel-\nopment of the prototype, as well as expanding the knowledge\nand practices of all the participants. Indeed, we propose a\nmethodology that organizes the dialogue around a prototype\nso that it fosters a coordinated expansion of all three spaces.\nTable 2 shows for example how the C space was moved\nfollowing the use of the prototypes. For instance, in the case\nof sclerotinia, the C space was expanded by new concepts\nsuch as the ‘Information and Advice Systems (IAS)’ (see\nTaverne and Cerf2009), the‘insurance system’or ‘an indica-\ntor for better timing of treatment in relation to late infections’.\nNext, thanks to the debriefings, which explored the cognitive,\nfunctional and operational limits encountered during the use\nof the prototype, we notably identified new knowledge needed\non statistical methods to balance type 1 and type 2 errors. In\nthe Diagvar case, the C space expanded as users acknowl-\nedged the advantages of using the tool to‘optimize a network\nof cultivar trials’. Knowledge was produced to test the reli-\nability of a non-destructive test for assessing the nitrogen\nstatus of plants in a range of cropping situations similar to\nthat encountered by the operators (Prost and Jeuffroy2007),\nand to build new statistical methods to identify limiting factors\nin different dataset configurations (Prost et al.2008). Several\nquestions could not be addressed immediately but were noted\nfor further discussion.\nAt this stage of our work, we cannot affirm that the two\nstages of our methodology are neither necessary nor suffi-\ncient to encourage the coordinated expansion of the spaces\nof concepts or of knowledge. Other researchers (Hatchuel et\nal. 2009, in the industrial world, or Groot Koerkamp and\n908 M. Cerf et al.\n\nBos 2008, in the agricultural domain) monitor this expan-\nsion by not only increasing creativity but also including a\nvariety of actors. Even if further investigation is needed, our\nexamples show that thinking about uses in practice also\nraises the possibility of a coordinated expansion of the\nspaces of concepts and knowledge.\n4.4 A call for more debates about design methodology in the\nagronomic community\nThe proposals explained in this paper aim to show the value of\nscientific reflection on design methodologies. They are\nintended to go beyond the usual vision of engineering activity\nin agronomy, often regarded as a simple gathering of knowl-\nedge produced in the discipline. Our examples show that\ndesign involves both the application of existing knowledge\nand the production of new knowledge. They also show that\nthe production and exploitation of knowledge (whether agro-\nnomic or from other disciplines) during this engineering ac-\ntivity would be worthy of methodological and conceptual\ndevelopments. This will result in greater professionalism on\nthis aspect of the researcher's work. They suggest that it could\nbe useful to create opportunities, first for discussion and\nexchange within the agronomic community, on theoretical\nand methodological aspects worthy of study, and second for\ncarrying out such activities.\n5 Conclusion\nBased on two design projects, we have developed and dis-\ncussed some propositions for a new participatory process for\nthe design of agronomic decision support tools. The added\nvalue of this methodology is to enable designers and users to\ninteract in the joint development of the tool and the working\nsituations. To develop the methodology, we have focused on\nthe need to take into account the use situations of the tools\nbeing designed, including their special features and their\ndiversity, and have proposed two stages to achieve this.\nThe first stage aims at completing a diagnosis of uses, which\nis a new way to start the process of designing decision\nsupport tools. This diagnosis aims to understand the work\nsituations in which the tools may help to solve a problem.\nThree points of view are used to observe and characterize\nthe work situations: a cognitive one focused on the ways of\nrepresenting a problem, a functional one focused on the\ntools used to take decisions in that context, and an opera-\ntional one focused on the constraints of the activity in which\nthe tools will be used. We have shown from our two case\nstudies that such diagnosis is the first way to devise new\nconcepts (or ideas) of tools and to rethink the flexibility to\ngive to the tools. The diagnosis is also crucial to be able to\nstart the second stage as it identifies the work situations in\nwhich the prototype could be used. This second stage ena-\nbles the users to use the prototype in real situations and to\ndebrief on this use. It is also unusual as it allows them to\ncontinue the design into use. Our methodology enabled the\nparticipants of our two design processes to point out diffi-\nculties encountered during use and to decide how these\nproblems should be solved within a new design cycle.\nWe hope to have provided the agronomic research com-\nmunity with elements for reflection on a participatory design\napproach based on dialogue around a decision support tool,\nelaborating on the idea suggested by McCown (2001). We\nbelieve that the dialogue has to take place quite early in the\ndesign process so that it becomes possible to simultaneously\nexpand the concept, the knowledge and the use spaces, e.g.\nexpanding both the intangible and tangible dimensions of\nthese spaces. We invite the community to develop further\nmethodological discussions on design, since dialogical de-\nsign is conducive to the dynamic production and use of\nagronomic knowledge.\nReferences\nBéguin P (2007) In search of a unit of analysis for designing instru-\nments.
