    "abstract": "The electronic power transformer (EPT) raises concerns for its notable size and volume reduction compared with traditional line frequency transformers. Medium frequency transformers (MFTs) are important components in high voltage and high power energy conversion systems such as EPTs. High voltage and high power make the reliable insulation design of MFT more difficult. In this paper, the influence of wire type and interleaved winding structure on the electric field distribution of MFT is discussed in detail. The electric field distributions for six kinds of typical non-interleaved windings with different wire types are researched using a 2-D finite element method (FEM). The electric field distributions for one non-interleaved winding and two interleaved windings are also studied using 2-D FEM. Furthermore, the maximum electric field intensities are obtained and compared. The results show that, in this case study, compared with foil conductor, smaller maximum electric field intensity can be achieved using litz wire in secondary winding. Besides, interleaving can increase the maximum electric field intensity when insulation distance is constant. The proposed method of studying the electric field distribution and analysis results are expected to make a contribution to the improvement of electric field distribution in transformers.",
