Abrams\nPublished online: 10 January 2012\n# Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2011\nAbstract Recent research has shown that being able to inter-\nact with an object causes it to be perceived as being closer than\nobjects that cannot be interacted with. In the present study, we\nexamined whether that compression of perceived space would\nbe experienced by people who simply observed such interac-\ntions by others with no intention of performing the action\nthemselves. Participants judged the distance to targets after\nobserving an actor reach to an otherwise unreachable target\nwith a tool (Experiment 1) or illuminate a distant target with a\nlaser pointer (Experiment 2). Observing either type of inter-\naction caused a compression of perceived space, revealing that\nap e r s o n’s perception of space can be altered through mere\nobservation. These results indicate that shared representations\nbetween an actor and observer are engaged at the perceptual\nlevel easily and perhaps automatically, even in the absence of\ncooperation or an observer’s own intention to interact.\nKeywords Visual perception. Mirror effect\nHumans use tools to interact with objects that would other-\nwise be beyond reach, whether it is knocking a piece of fruit\nout of a tree or changing the TV channel from across the\nroom. Importantly, one’s choice to use a tool not only\nenables different behavioral outcomes, it can also funda-\nmentally alter one’s perception of the physical environment.\nFor example, extending one’s physical or functional reach\nwith a tool has the consequence of making otherwise out-of-\nreach objects appear closer (e.g., Witt, Proffitt, & Epstein,\n2005) even in the absence of visual feedback about the\ninteraction (Davoli, Brockmole, & Witt, in press). This\nspatial compression is thought to reflect a perceptual system\nthat represents the environment in terms of one’s ability to\ninteract within it (e.g., Witt,2011a). Hence, objects that are\nmore easily reachable are perceived to be closer. As social\nanimals, however, we rarely act within our environment in\nisolation, but rather do so in the presence of others or\nobserve another as he or she acts. This raises the question\nof whether observing an interaction such as what occurs\nduring tool use has the ability to cause perceptual changes\nfor the observer as it does for the actor. We examined this\nquestion in the present study.\nWhat reasons might there be to suspect that one who\nobserves tool use would perceive space in the same way as\nan actor? First, there is precedent for observer–actor mim-\nicry in the visual system: Spatial attention is known to be\nautomatically directed by social cues such as eye gaze\n(Friesen & Kingstone,1998), head gaze (Langton & Bruce,\n2000), pointing (Langton, O’Malley, & Bruce,1996), and\nimplied body motion (Gervais, Reed, Beall, & Roberts,\n2010). Furthermore, when performing collaborative tasks,\npeople tailor their attention and perception in response to\nwhat their partner is doing (see Sebanz, Bekkering, &\nKnoblich, 2006). For example, people spontaneously\ncoordinate the deployment of their own visual attention\nwith that of a partner when conversing about a common object\n(Richardson, Dale, & Kirkham,2007) or searching through\nNoam Roth is now affiliated with the Department of Neuroscience,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nWe would like to thank Emily Ehrman, Bryan Golubski, and Sarah\nWiesen for their help with data collection\nE.

Brockmole\nUniversity of Notre Dame,\nNotre Dame, IN, USA\nPsychon Bull Rev (2012) 19:177–183\nDOI 10.3758/s13423-011-0200-z\nthe same display (Brennan, Chen, Dickinson, Neider, &\nZelinksy, 2008; Welsh et al.,2007). Representation of a part-\nner’s task occurs even when it is unnecessary for completing\none’s own task (Sebanz, Knoblich, & Prinz,2003), and it\nseems that people automatically take into account what a co-\nviewer sees when considering their own perspective (Samson,\nApperly, Braithwaite, Andrews, & Scott,2010). At a neural\nlevel, these behavioral effects are mirrored by evidence that\nbrain areas that are active while performing a goal-directed\naction are also active during observation of that same action\n(e.g., Iacoboni et al.,2005; Rizzolatti & Craighero,2004),\nincluding areas that are responsible for perception–action\nintegration and that may be involved in action-induced per-\nceptual modulation. Taken together, these findings support the\nnotion that socially contextualized tasks engender a“common\nground,” or shared representation, amongst viewers that\nreflects an awareness of what the other person is doing (cf.\nSebanz et al.,2006, but compare Hommel, Colzato, & van den\nWildenberg, 2009, and Vlainic, Liepelt, Colzato, Prinz, &\nHommel, 2010).\nAlthough individuals may engage shared representations\nwhen performing cooperative tasks requiring mutual effort\nand participation with a partner, it is unknown whether the\nshared representations share a common perceptual basis. Ad-\nditionally, it is not known whether cooperation is necessary in\norder to form such shared representations. In the present study,\nwe directly investigated these issues. To determine the neces-\nsity of cooperation, we asked participants to observe the\nactions of another individual in the absence of any intention\nof performing the action themselves. In fact, the observer did\nnot even need to attend to the actor in order to successfully\ncomplete his or her task. To determine whether observer\neffects are perceptual, we asked whether the spatial compres-\nsion of distance seen in tool users is also present among\nparticipants observing tool use. InExperiment 1, participants\nwatched as their partners either reached (unsuccessfully) to an\nout-of-reach target with their arms or reached (successfully) to\nthe target with a reach-extending tool. Previous studies\nemploying this type of paradigm have demonstrated that\nactors estimate targets that can be reached as closer than those\nthat are out of reach (Witt,2011b;W i t te ta l . ,2005;W i t t&\nProffitt, 2008). If observation of an interaction is sufficient to\ncause spatial compression, then we should find that observers’\nestimates mimic that pattern. Previewing our results, we in-\ndeed found that those who observe another person using a tool\nshow the same perceptual distortions as the tool user.\nIn Experiment 2, we considered the fact that not all tools\nact to extend a user’s physical reach, but can act as a\nfunctional extension of one’s body by allowing a user to\nremotely affect a distant object, such as when a person turns\noff the TV with a remote or illuminates a projection screen\nwith a laser pointer. Despite the mechanistic differences\nbetween direct and remote tool use, both types cause spatial\ncompression for the user (Davoli et al.,in press; Witt et al.,\n2005). We thus sought to test the limits of spatial compres-\nsion for observers by asking whether that effect could result\nfrom watching remote tool use.\nExperiment 1: Observed direct tool use\nIn Experiment 1, we examined the possible modulation of\ndistance perception among participants observing another\nperson reach for an object. Researchers in previous studies\nhave found that using a tool to reach to an object that is\nbeyond the reach of one’s ar\n m reduces the perceived distance\nof that object (Witt et al.,2005). In order to determine whether\nobservation of tool use causes a similar compression of per-\nceived space, we asked one group of participants to make\ndistance estimates to a target while watching another group\nreach toward the target either with their arm or with a reach-\nextending tool. If observation has similar perceptual conse-\nquences as action, then observers should perceive targets to be\ncloser on trials in which their partners are able to reach to them\nwith a tool, even when the physical distance of the objects\nremains unchanged. If the spatial compression associated with\ntool-use only occurs for actors, however, then observers\nshould give equivalent distance estimates regardless of wheth-\ner their partners can successfully reach to the target or not, and\nthus regardless of whether they reach with their arm or a tool.\nMethod\nParticipants Thirty-two right-handed Washington University\nundergraduates participated for course credit.\nApparatus, stimuli, procedure, and design Participants\ncompleted the experiment in pairs, with one participant\nin each session randomly assigned to the role of actor\n(16 total) and the other assigned as observer (16 total).\nPairs of participants were seated side by side at the end\nof a table that was 152 cm wide and 152 cm long, with\none participant assigned to the “actor” condition and the\nother to the “observer” condition. The table was placed\nat a diagonal in the room and was covered with a black\ncloth to minimize environmental anchors by which par-\nticipants could judge distances. All participants used a\nchin rest to maintain head position across trials. A metal\nball that was 2.54 cm in diameter was the target stim-\nulus. The ball could be placed at 10 possible locations,\nall beyond reach of participants’ arms: 75 cm, 80 cm,\n85 cm, 90 cm, 95 cm, 100 cm, 105 cm, 110 cm,\n1 1 5c m ,o r1 2 0c ma w a yf r o mt h et a b l e’se d g en e a r e s t\nthe participants’ bodies; this comprised a set of distance\njudgments. Eight sets were presented sequentially, with\n178 Psychon Bull Rev (2012) 19:177–183\nthe order of distances within each set independently\nrandomized. There were two conditions, arm pointing\nand tool pointing. During the arm pointing condition,\nparticipants pointed toward the target with the index\nfinger of their dominant hands. During the tool pointing\ncondition, participants used a 65-cm long pointing stick\nto point toward the target.\nAt the beginning of each trial, participants were asked to\nclose their eyes while the experimenter placed the ball at one\nlocation. When the ball was in place, actors then pointed to\nit with either their arm or the tool while the observer\nwatched the movement. After the pointing was completed,\nobservers provided a written estimate of the target’s distance\nin whatever units they were most comfortable using (inches\nor centimeters). All measurements were converted to centi-\nmeters for the analysis. The pointing conditions were pre-\nsented in two blocks of four sets, with the pointing condition\nfixed within a block and with condition order counterbalanced\nacross participants.\nResults and discussion\nData are depicted in Fig.1. We eliminated the three farthest\ntarget distances (110 cm, 115 cm, and 120 cm) from analysis\nbecause some actors were unable to reach those targets even\nwhen using the tool. Therefore, the included distances are\nones that all actors were able to reach with the tool. Distance\nestimates were submitted to a 2 (observation type: arm\npointing, tool pointing) x 7 (distance: 75 cm, 80 cm, 85 cm,\n90 cm, 95 cm, 100 cm, 105 cm) repeated measures ANOV A.\nNot surprisingly, as physical distance increased, so too did\ndistance estimates,F(6, 90) 0 156.36, p <. 0 0 1 ,η\np\n2 0 .91.\nMore importantly, observers judged targets to be closer after\nwatching actors reach with the tool as compared with their\narms, F(1, 15)0 5.78, p <. 0 5 ,η\np\n2 0 .22. Tool pointing had a\nregression equation ofy 0 5.89x +6 3 . 6 5 ,R2 0 .997, and arm\npointing had a regression equation ofy 0 6.07x +6 5 . 4 0 ,R2 0\n.999. The effects of distance and observation type did not\ninteract, F(6, 90)0 6.16, p >. 3 0 ,ηp\n2 0 .02.\nResults indicate that simply observing another person use\na tool to reach toward an otherwise unreachable object is\nsufficient to cause a compression of perceived space, mim-\nicking the pattern of perceptual distortion experienced by\nactors (e.g., Witt et al.,2005). This finding suggests that\nindividuals who observe others directly interacting with\nobjects share a common perceptual representation with the\nactors themselves. InExperiment 2, we tested the limits of\nthis shared representation by examining whether the same\ncompression could occur when observing remote interac-\ntions— ones in which a user’s reach is still functionally\nextended, but not physically extended.\nExperiment 2: Observed remote tool use\nIn Experiment 2, we examined whether perceptual compres-\nsion would be found when participants observed another\nFig. 1 Mean estimated distance\nto the target as a function of\nobservation type.Lines are the\nlines of best fit\nPsychon Bull Rev (2012) 19:177–183 179\nperson performing a remote interaction with a distant object\n(i.e., illuminating a target with a laser pointer). Although\ncompression of perceived space has been demonstrated in\nparticipants who themselves remotely interact with an object\n(Davoli et al.,in press), it is unclear whether that perceptual\ndistortion would also be experienced by one who simply\nobserves a remote interaction. Thus, in the present experi-\nment, participants judged the distance between themselves\nand a target while another person either illuminated or\nsimply pointed at the target. If observing a remote interac-\ntion with the environment is sufficient to influence the\nperception of the observer, then participants who watch\nanother person illuminate a target with a laser pointer should\nperceive it to be closer as compared with those who just\nwatch another point to a target. If spatial compression in this\ncase is perceptually restricted to the one who performs the\ninteraction, however, then distance judgments should not\ndepend on whether participants observe an interaction be-\ntween another person and the target.\nMethod\nParticipants Thirty-six experimentally naive University of\nNotre Dame undergraduates participated in exchange for\ncourse credit.\nApparatus, stimuli, procedure, and designThe experiment\nwas conducted in a basement hallway (42.5 m long and\n2.6 m wide) of the psychology building at the University\nof Notre Dame. The target was a standard shooting target,\nmounted on a wooden stand. The center of the target was\n127 cm above the floor. The target could be placed at eight\npossible locations: 1.8 m, 5.2 m, 8.8 m, 13.4 m, 19.2 m,\n22.6 m, 26.2 m, or 30.5 m away from the participant. There\nwere two observations per location, for a total of 16 exper-\nimental trials. The order of locations was randomized with\nthe exceptions that each of the eight unique locations had to\nbe used before a location could be repeated, and a location\ncould not be repeated within three trials of its first\noccurrence.\nEach experimental session involved a confederate,\nplayed by the same undergraduate research assistant in all\nsessions. The experimenter explained that the participant\nand the confederate would be working together to complete\nthe experiment. The role of the confederate was to first point\nto the target with either a metal baton or a laser pointer, and\nthe role of the participant was to then estimate the distance\nto the target. Although the assignment of those roles was\nposed to participants as being randomly determined, in\nactuality, it never varied. An equal number of participants\nobserved the confederate use the laser pointer (i.e.,observed\ninteraction condition) or the baton (i.e.,observed pointing\ncondition), and the assignm ent to those conditions was\nrandomly determined. The laser pointer and baton were both\ncylindrical in shape and measured 15 cm in length and\n1.4 cm in diameter. Both were constructed from metals to\nequate, as much as possible, their look.\nThe participant and the confederate stood next to each\nother at a fixed location at one end of the hallway. Before\neach trial, the participant and the confederate both turned\naround so that they could not see the experimenter position\nthe target. Trials began with the confederate either pointing\nto the center of the target with the baton or illuminating the\ntarget with the laser pointer. The confederate verbally\naffirmed when he believed to be pointing as close to center\nas possible, at which point (while he continued to hold his\naim) the participant estimated the distance to the target.\nParticipants were encouraged to use whatever they believed\nto be their most accurate unit of measurement (feet, yards,\netc.). For analysis, all measurements were converted to\nmeters.\nResults and discussion\nData are depicted in Fig.2. Mean distance estimates were\nsubmitted to a 2 (observation condition: interaction or\npointing) x 8 (physical distance to target: 1.8 m, 5.2 m,\n8.8 m, 13.4 m, 19.2 m, 22.6 m, 26.2 m, 30.5 m) mixed\nfactors ANOVA.\nAs would be expected, verbal estimates increased as\nthe distance to the target increased, F(7, 238) 0 217.45,\np < .001, η\np\n2 0 .87. Importantly, participants in the\nobserved interaction condition estimated the targets to\nbe closer than did participants in the observed pointing\ncondition, F(1, 38) 0 5.73, p <. 0 5 ,ηp\n2 0 .14. Obser-\nvation condition also interacted with physical distance\nsuch that the differences in estimations between the two\nobservation conditions incr eased as physical distance\nincreased, F(7, 238) 0 4.21, p <. 0 5 ,ηp\n2 0 .11. Planned\ncomparisons revealed significantly shorter distance esti-\nmates in the observed interaction condition than in the\nobserved pointing condition at the farthest four target\nlocations, ts(34) > 2.07, ps<. 0 5 .A t8 . 8ma n d1 3 . 4m ,\nthe differences between distance estimates did not reach\nstatistical significance, but there is a clear trend in the\nsame direction, ts(34) > 1.85, ps < .075. The regression\nequation for observed pointing was y 0 1.144x +. 6 9 8 ,\nR\n2 0 .997, and the regression equation for the observed\ninteraction was y 0 .869x +. 0 2 1 ,R2 0 .999. These\nresults suggest that when the target was further than\n13.4 m away, participants who observed a remote inter-\naction between another person and a target perceived\nthe target to be significantly closer than did participants\n180 Psychon Bull Rev (2012) 19:177–183\nwho observed another person pointing at but not inter-\nacting with a target. The spatial compression found here\nduring observed remote tool-use replicates the previous\nfinding of the presence of spatial compression during\nactual remote tool-use (Davoli et al., in press).\nIt is worth noting that although spatial compression\nwas found during observed tool use in bothExperiments\n1 and 2, the pattern of compression appears to be\ndifferent. In Experiment 1 , the compression manifests\nas a constant underestimation across distances, whereas\nin Experiment 2, compression effects increase with in-\ncreasing target distance. This difference likely originates\nfrom the nature of spatial compression effects. Compres-\nsion appears to be proportional to target distance, mean-\ning that the graded pattern can emerge only over large\ndistances. The restriction of range in Experiment 1\ncauses the proportional reduction to be virtually identi-\ncal across all distances, whereas the larger range in\nExperiment 2 allows this pattern to be apparent.\nGeneral discussion\nEfficient perception of the actions of others is of fundamental\nimportance for humans. For instance, it is through observation\nthat we generate and inform our own motoric vocabularies,\nfrom basic movements at the earliest stages of development\n(Meltzoff & Moore,1977; Piaget,1952)t os o c i a l l yr e l e v a n t\nbehaviors (Bandura, 1977; Reed & McIntosh, 2008)a n d\ncomplex new skills (Hayes, Ashford, & Bennett, 2008)\nthroughout adulthood. And indeed, our visual system is well\nsuited toward the task of observing what others do, since we\nare able to rapidly and accurately extract human motion from\notherwise ambiguous environments (e.g., Blake & Shiffrar,\n2007). In the present study, we found that participants who\nmerely observed an actor interact with a target using a tool,\neither directly or remotely, showed the same pattern of spatial\ncompression as has been found previously in actors. What this\ndemonstrates is that not only are we expert processors of\nhuman action, but that we also are able to have our own\nperception altered by observing this action.\nWhy might it be the case that observing an action can\nalter perception in the same way as performance? One\npossible explanation is that some brain regions that are\nactive when performing an action are also active when\nobserving it (Buccino, Binkofski, & Riggio,2004; Chong,\nCunnington, Williams, Kanwisher, & Mattingley, 2008).\nThere are some reasons why such dual influence may be\nbeneficial. One is that by forming representations of others’\nactions, we are better able to understand their intentions\n(e.g., Brass & Heyes, 2005; Iacoboni, 2005). It has also\nbeen suggested that representing the actions of others\nduring observation aids in the selection of appropriate\nactions for ourselves (Hickok & Hauser,2010). Regardless of\nthe purpose, the results of the present study are consistent with\nan account positing shared activation for both action and\nobservation. The neural activity that leads to modulated dis-\ntance perception for actors using a tool may be similar for\nparticipants merely observing tool use, causing spatial com-\npression in both groups.\nFig. 2 Mean estimated distance\nto the target as a function of\nobservation type.Lines are the\nlines of best fit\nPsychon Bull Rev (2012) 19:177–183 181\nAnother possible explanation for why observers showed\nsimilar perceptual effects to those expected among actors\nrelates to the deployment of attention for both the actor and\nobserver. Davoli et al. (in press) found spatial compression\nin participants performing remote interactions by shining a\nlaser pointer on a distant target, and suggested that this may\nhave occurred because participants engaged more attention-\nal resources during the interaction. In order to interact suc-\ncessfully, participants likely needed to focus attention on the\ndistant target, leading to a simultaneous altering of the\nperceptual attributes of the target. This alteration may arise\ndue to a common coding of perception and action (Hommel,\nMüsseler, Aschersleben, & Prinz,2001). According to this\nview, cognitive representations inform not only perception,\nbut action planning as well. Thus, the ability to act on an\nobject may also change the corresponding perception of that\nobject. In the present studies, the observer did not need to\ninteract with the targets him- or herself. However, people are\nknown to coordinate the deployment of their own visual\nattention with that of a partner (Brennan et al., 2008;\nRichardson et al.,2007; Welsh et al.,2007) and represent\na partner’s task even when it is unnecessary for completing\ntheir own task (Sebanz et al., 2003). This type of joint\nattention has been shown to lead to shared perceptual input\n(Sebanz et al.,2006). Thus, it is possible that if the actor in\nour experiments engaged more attentional resources during\ninteraction, the observer may have done so as well. It\nremains to be seen to what extent attentional resources\naccount for the mechanisms that underlie perceptual alter-\nations during interaction.\nIn the present study, participants who were assigned to\nobserve the actor never had any intention of performing the\naction themselves, and in fact they did not even need to\nattend to the actor to successfully complete their task. This\neliminated two important reasons for the observer to form a\nshared representation with the actor: intention to perform the\naction and cooperation needed to complete the task. It has\nbeen shown that merely holding a tool without the intention\nto use it does not alter perception (Witt et al.,2005), and\ncollaborative tasks cause participants to tailor their percep-\ntion to their partner (Sebanz et al.,2006). In spite of this lack\nof cooperation and intention, observers still established a\nshared representation with the actors that showed effects at a\nperceptual level. This indicates that shared representations\nbetween an actor and observer are easily, and perhaps even\nautomatically, established.\nThere is convincing evidence that humans understand the\nworld in terms of action and interaction (e.g., Witt,2011a).\nWatching someone perform an action not only provides\ninformation about the object of the action, but also informs\nthe observer of what is necessary for that interaction to be\nsuccessful. Additionally, as the present experiments have\nshown, observing an interaction can change the perception\nof an object, perhaps increasing the likelihood of a success-\nful interaction by the observer in the future. These findings\nprovide support for the notion that we not only learn about\nthe world through our own physical experiences, but that we\nalso have the ability to learn through the experiences of\nothers.\nReferences\nBandura, A.
