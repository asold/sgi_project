  "abstract": "DGA is one of the most recent techniques developed to diagnose the fault condition on oil filled insulation transformers. There are more than 6 known different methods of DGA fault interpretation technique and so there is the likelihood that they may vary in their interpretations. A series of combined interpretation methods that can determine the power transformer condition faults in one assessment is therefore needed. This paper presents a computer program- based system developed to combine four DGA assessment techniques; Rogers Ratio Method, IEC Basic Ratio Method, Duval Triangle method and Key Gas Method. An easy to use Graphic User Interface was designed to give a visual display of the four techniques. The result shows that this assessment method can increase the accuracy of DGA methods by up to 20% and the no prediction result had been reduced down to 0%.",
