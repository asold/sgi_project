  "abstract": "In modern manufacturing, making accurate and timely decisions requires the ability to effectively handle multiple types of data. This paper presents a multimodal system designed specifically for smart manufacturing applications. The system combines various data sources including images, sensor data, and production records, using advanced multimodal large language models. This approach addresses common limitations of traditional single-modal methods, such as isolated data analysis and poor integration between different data types. Key contributions include a unified method for representing different data types, dynamic semantic tokenization for better data processing, strong alignment strategies across modalities, and a practical two-stage training method involving initial large-scale pretraining and later fine-tuning for specific tasks. Additionally, a novel Transformer-based model is introduced for generating both images and text, significantly improving real-time decision-making capabilities. Experiments on relevant industrial datasets show that this method consistently performs better than current state-of-the-art approaches in tasks like image–text retrieval and visual question answering. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed methods, offering important insights and practical solutions to enhance intelligent manufacturing, predictive maintenance, and anomaly detection, thus supporting the development of more efficient and reliable industrial systems.",
