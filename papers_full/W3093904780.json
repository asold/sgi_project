  "abstract": "A mathematical model has been developed to study the wave processes of two-winding transformers, taking into account the electromagnetic connections between the turns of the winding and between the windings. To solve differential-integral equations in partial derivatives, a method of separation of variables is proposed. References 12, figures 2.",
