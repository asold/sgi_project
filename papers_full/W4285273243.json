Through quanti-\ntative benchmarks, we show that this is a viable\nway to reduce prejudice in pre-trained language\nmodels while remaining cost-effective at scale.\n1 Introduction\nTransformer-based language models such as GPT-2\n(Radford et al., 2019), GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020),\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al.,\n2019), and ALBERT (Lan et al., 2020) have pro-\npelled advances in Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) for tasks including language modeling, text\ngeneration, and more (Zhang et al., 2022). While\nthese powerful language models pick up useful pat-\nterns such as English grammar and syntax, they\nalso learn harmful and nuanced information. Anal-\nysis by Sheng et al. (2019) reveals that GPT-2 will\nreveal gendered, racial, and religious stereotypes.\nThus, practitioners must ensure that their language\nmodels benefit all people fairly before deploying\nthem into the real world.\nIn recent work, Solaiman and Dennison (2021)\ndemonstrate that fine-tuning GPT-3 on a curated\ndataset will mitigate biased output. However, their\napproach requires fine-tuning the entire model,\nwhich has a few fundamental limitations. First,\ntraining a large language model such as GPT-2 or\nGPT-3 from scratch takes considerable time, costs\non the order of millions of dollars, and emits hun-\ndreds of tons of CO2 into the environment (Ben-\nder et al., 2021). Second, fine-tuning all param-\neters may significantly drop the language model-\ning performance due to “catastrophic forgetting”:\nThe phenomenon when an AI model unlearns old\nknowledge when trained with additional informa-\ntion (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017).\nWe propose a novel approach to modify a GPT-2\nlanguage model that overcomes the aforementioned\nlimitations. In particular, our approach is inspired\nby Lu et al. (2021), who adapt an existing GPT-\n2 model (trained on English text) to completely\ndifferent task modalities such as image classifica-\ntion. They froze over 99% of the model’s trainable\nparameters (namely the attention and feedforward\nlayers, which do the bulk of the computation) while\nonly modifying the layer norm parameters, posi-\ntional embeddings, and applying a linear transfor-\nmation to the input and output layer. A natural\nquestion arises—\nIf it is possible to adapt a language model to\ncompletely different tasks and modalities in such\nan efficient way, then is it possible to mitigate lan-\nguage model prejudice through similar means?\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\nFirst, we show that fine-tuning less than 1% of the\nGPT-2 language model can reduce prejudice on\nquantitative benchmarks. Second, we publicly re-\nlease our fine-tuned model on GitHub1 and provide\na live demo on Hugging Face Spaces to qualita-\ntively compare our model output side-by-side with\nthe original GPT-2 output.2\n1https://github.com/michaelgira23/\ndebiasing-lms\n2https://huggingface.co/spaces/\nmichaelgira23/debiasing-lms\n59\n2 Related Work\nBias Issues in Machine Learning Unfair be-\nhaviors have been found in many machine learning\nand artificial intelligence applications, including fa-\ncial recognition (Raji and Buolamwini, 2019), rec-\nommendation systems (Schnabel et al., 2016), and\nspeech recognition (Koenecke et al., 2020). One\nmajor source of bias comes from training datasets\nthat render models to behave negatively towards\nunderrepresented groups (Mehrabi et al., 2021).\nFor example, Shankar et al. (2017) found that Im-\nageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) and the Open\nImages dataset (Krasin et al., 2017) disproportion-\nately represented people from North America and\nEurope. To mitigate biased behaviors in machine\nlearning models, researchers have proposed meth-\nods targeting different tasks and domains, such as\nclassification (Menon and Williamson, 2018; Roh\net al., 2021), regression (Agarwal et al., 2019; Berk\net al., 2017), and adversarial learning (Xu et al.,\n2018).\nBias Issues in NLP Models Traditional static\nword embedding models are no exception to this\ntrend and also demonstrate gender bias. Bolukbasi\net al. (2016) showed that in word2vec (Mikolov\net al., 2013), the embedding vector “doctor” is\ncloser to “male” than to “female.” Similarly,\nCaliskan et al. (2017) found that GloVe (Penning-\nton et al., 2014) and word2vec (Mikolov et al.,\n2013) contained the same stereotype associations\nfound in classic human psychology studies (Green-\nwald et al., 1998). Sheng et al. (2019) and May\net al. (2019) revealed harmful stereotypes in pre-\ntrained language models and their contextual word\nembeddings such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018),\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), and BERT (Devlin\net al., 2019).\nEarly works measured bias at the word level us-\ning the cosine similarity between embedding vec-\ntors such as Bolukbasi et al. (2016) and the Word\nEmbedding Association Tests (WEAT) (Caliskan\net al., 2017). May et al. (2019) extended WEAT\nto the Sentence Encoder Association Test (SEAT)\nto measure bias in ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019). However, they found\ninconsistencies in such cosine-based measurements\napplied to contextual word embeddings. Later, Ku-\nrita et al. (2019) proposed a more consistent met-\nric by masking combinations of target words and\nattributes and measuring the predicted token prob-\nabilities from a BERT model. Sheng et al. (2019)\ndefined and measured a concept of regard and sen-\ntiment for GPT-2 output. Finally, Nadeem et al.\n(2021) proposed a new benchmark called StereoSet.\nIt includes sentence- and discourse-level measure-\nments that cover bias among genders, races, pro-\nfessions, and religions. In this work, we applied\nStereoSet to evaluate our models.\nMitigating Bias in NLP Models Bolukbasi\net al. (2016) mitigated bias by subtracting the pro-\njected gender direction from words that should be\ngender-neutral while also maintaining equal dis-\ntance between non-gendered words and pairs of\ngendered words. Zhao et al. (2018b) reserved cer-\ntain dimensions of embedding vectors for gender in-\nformation, where gender-neutral words were made\northogonal to the gender direction. Gonen and\nGoldberg (2016) pointed out a limitation in the\ntwo previous methods that the relative similarity\namong words still exists; i.e., words that are biased\ntowards the same group remain close to each other.\nZhao et al. (2018a) and Zhao et al. (2019) used data\naugmentation to replace gendered words with their\nopposites in the original training corpus, and they\ntrained a new model on the union of both corpora.\nHowever, this method requires re-training that is ex-\npensive with large-scale neural networks. Finally,\nPeng et al. (2020) applied normative fine-tuning on\nGPT-2 to reduce the frequency of non-normative\noutput.\nTransfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Trans-\nfer learning studies how to transfer machine-\nlearned knowledge to different but related domains\n(Zhuang et al., 2020). Fine-tuning, one approach\nof transfer learning, has been widely used for\nneural network models (Ge and Yu, 2017; Jung\net al., 2015; Maqsood et al., 2019; Shin et al.,\n2016). Specifically in the field of NLP, fine-tuning\ncan transfer language models such as transform-\ners (Vaswani et al., 2017) into various other task\nmodalities (Abramson et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy\net al., 2020; Lu et al., 2021; Radford et al., 2021).\nFor example, Lu et al. (2021) fine-tuned transform-\ners pre-trained on English text to perform well on\nsequence classification tasks in the domains of nu-\nmerical computation, vision, and biology.\n60\n3 Method\n3.1 Dataset\nWe curated a fine-tuning dataset by combining the\nWinoBias (Zhao et al., 2018a) and CrowS-Pairs\n(Nangia et al., 2020) datasets to obtain a total of\n4,600 sentences, further split into training (80%),\ncross-validation (10%), and testing sets (10%). We\ndescribe the contents of each dataset below.\n3.1.1 WinoBias\nThe WinoBias dataset provided by Zhao et al.\n(2018a) contains 1,584 training sentences involving\nboth genders and professions such that professions\nare described with an equal distribution of mascu-\nline and feminine pronouns.\n3.1.2 CrowS-Pairs\nAdditionally, we incorporated the CrowS-Pairs\ndataset provided by Nangia et al. (2020), containing\n1,508 pairs of sentences. The first sentence of each\npair targets a stereotype of a historically marginal-\nized group; the second sentence is a minor edit of\nthe first, but it targets a different demographic or\nattribute. We use both the stereotyped and anti-\nstereotyped sentences to remain impartial towards\neach demographic.\n3.2 Fine-Tuning\nWe modified the GPT-2 small model publicly avail-\nable via the Hugging Face Transformers library.3\nFor each experiment, we froze the entire model and\napplied one or more of the following modifications:\n1. Unfreezing the layer norm parameters\n2. Unfreezing the word embeddings\n3. Unfreezing the word positioning embeddings\n4. Adding a linear input transformation\n5. Adding a linear output transformation\nThe linear input and output transformation layers\nare initialized as an identity matrix with unfrozen\nparameters.\nWe trained the models with a cross-entropy loss\nand a batch size of 50. See Table 3 for the learning\nrate and training epochs of each model combina-\ntion. After fine-tuning each altered model with\noptimized hyperparameters according to the cross-\nvalidation dataset, we applied the StereoSet bench-\nmark.\n3https://huggingface.co/docs/\ntransformers/model_doc/gpt2\n3.3 StereoSet Benchmark\nStereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021) provides a quanti-\ntative assessment regarding how prone a language\nmodel is to stereotypical bias. The benchmark con-\nsists of various fill-in-the-blank tests (called Con-\ntext Association Tests or CATs) with three multiple\nchoice answers. A CAT prompt partially describes\na person or situation. The model in question must\ncomplete the prompt with one of three given op-\ntions. One response reflects a traditional stereo-\ntype; another response reflects the opposite of that\nstereotype, and the last response is nonsensical.\nStereoSet contains two types of tasks: intrasen-\ntence and intersentence. Intrasentence prompts con-\nsist of one sentence with the final word redacted,\nand the model must complete that sentence. In-\ntersentence prompts begin with one complete sen-\ntence, and the model must choose the logical next\nsentence. While the original StereoSet work used\nboth intrasentence and intersentence tasks, we fo-\ncused only on intrasentence.\nStereoSet calculates three scores according to\nhow the model completes the prompts. The lan-\nguage modeling score (LMS) represents the per-\ncentage of tests when the model picks a logical\nanswer (either the stereotyped or anti-stereotyped\nanswer) over the nonsensical answer. For the ideal\nlanguage model, its LMS would be 100. The\nstereotype score (SS) represents the percentage\nof tests where the model picks a stereotyped an-\nswer over the anti-stereotyped answer. An ideal\nlanguage model’s SS would be 50, where the model\nprefers both the stereotyped and anti-stereotyped\nresponse with equal probability. StereoSet makes\nthe assumption that both of these answers should be\nequally likely, despite any real-world context such\nas the actual gender distribution across professions.\nFinally, the Idealized CAT score (ICAT)is a com-\nbination of the LMS and SS with the following\nformula:\nICAT = LMS · min(SS, 100 − SS)\n50\nThe ICAT score has the following properties: it\nreaches 100 when the LMS is 100 and the SS is\n50, representing the perfect ideal model; when\nthe model always picks the stereotyped or anti-\nstereotyped answer (representing an SS of 100 or\n0, respectively), then the ICAT will be 0; finally,\na completely random model will have an ICAT of\n50.\n61\nSTEREOSETINTRASENTENCESCORES\nOVERALL GENDER PROFESSION RACE RELIGION\nMODIFICATIONSLM SS ICATLM SS ICATLM SS ICATLM SS ICATLM SS ICAT\nBASELINE\n(UNMODIFIED) 91.11 61.93 69.37 93.2862.67 69.65 92.29 63.97 66.50 89.76 60.35 71.18 88.46 58.02 74.27\nLN 92.3261.24 71.57 92.62 60.0773.9693.61 61.30 72.45 91.4761.73 70.01 88.74 58.57 73.51\nLN + WPE 92.31 61.04 71.9392.61 60.34 73.45 93.7761.17 72.8191.33 61.38 70.54 88.45 57.91 74.45\nLN + WPE + WTE90.18 60.89 70.54 91.60 64.71 64.64 91.71 61.12 71.31 88.90 60.0471.05 85.54 56.05 75.20\nLN + WPE + WTE+ INPUT/OUTPUT\nLAYER\n90.79 60.8871.03 91.08 66.08 61.79 92.15 60.6972.45 89.72 60.10 71.6089.0554.8580.45\nFULLMODEL\nUNFROZEN\n91.22 61.41 70.40 92.53 61.47 71.31 92.80 62.46 69.67 89.89 60.87 70.34 87.04 57.27 74.38\nTable 1: Various model combinations and their corresponding StereoSet Intrasentence scores. The baseline is an\nunmodified GPT-2 model. Models with LN fine-tune the layer norm parameters. Models with WPE fine-tune the\nword positioning embeddings. Models with WTE fine-tune the word embeddings. Models with Input/Output Layer\nadd a linear transformation to both the input and output of the model. All other parameters in the modified models\nremained frozen. Each experiment was run n=10 times, with their average displayed in the table. The best score for\neach column is bold. See Table 4 for the standard deviations of each cell.\n4 Results\nSee Table 1 for experimental results. Across the\nboard, fine-tuning these models (excluding the fully\nunfrozen model) resulted in an average of 0.29\npoint increase in the StereoSet LMS, 0.92 decrease\nin the StereoSet SS, and a 1.90 point increase in\nthe StereoSet ICAT score.\nWe hypothesize that the slight average increase\nin the LMS can be attributed to the model better\nfitting the task itself; i.e., the curated dataset more\nclosely resembles the StereoSet CAT prompts com-\npared to the heterogeneous repository from which\nGPT-2 was originally trained (Radford et al., 2019).\nThe StereoSet SS decrease signifies that the models\ncorrectly balance the word distributions away from\ntraditional stereotypes. Overall, this leads to an\nICAT increase of about 2.73% by training only a\nrelatively small portion of the model.\nRoughly a third of the fine-tuning dataset comes\nfrom WinoBias (Zhao et al., 2018a), which fo-\ncuses on gender and profession bias, which may\nexplain why the StereoSet gender and profession\ncategories observed particularly good results. For\nStereoSet intrasentence gender, the top-performing\nmodel (LN) observed a 2.59 point decrease in its\nSS, which is a 4.14% improvement from baseline\nleading to an ICAT increase of 4.31 (6.19%).\nThe top-performing overall model was the LN +\nWPE model, which we fine-tuned on only 0.66%\nof the original GPT-2 parameters (Table 2). The\nfine-tuned models show only a slight decrease or\neven increase in the LMS, demonstrating that this\nmethod is resilient to catastrophic forgetting. Addi-\ntionally, the performance of the partially fine-tuned\nmodels matches or exceeds the StereoSet perfor-\nmance of fine-tuning the entire model. These re-\nsults suggest that the prejudice tested in StereoSet\nresides in a relatively small portion of the GPT-2\nlanguage model.\n5 Conclusion\nBefore successfully deploying these powerful lan-\nguage models in real-world applications, society\nmust take steps to ensure that it does not marginal-\nMODIFICATIONS NUMBER OF\nUNFROZEN\nPARAMETERS\nTIME PER\nTRAINING\nEPOCH(S)\nBASELINE\n(UNMODIFIED)\n0 -\nLN 38K (0.03%) 9.10\nLN + WPE 824K (0.66%) 9.02\nLN + WPE + WTE 39M (31.68%) 10.98\nLN + WPE + WTE\n+ INPUT/OUTPUT\nLAYER\n40M (32.32%) 11.07\nFULL MODEL\nUNFROZEN\n124M (100%) 13.23\nTable 2: Various model combinations and their num-\nber of unfrozen parameters.

We propose a method of mitigating\ngender bias in a GPT-2 language model by fine-\ntuning less than 1% of the original model on a cu-\nrated training set of only 3,680 sentences. Through\nthe StereoSet quantitative benchmark, we demon-\nstrate that fine-tuning can help to reduce model\nprejudice at scale while preventing catastrophic\nforgetting. Future work may look at reducing prej-\nudice in other demographics beyond the four types\ntested in StereoSet. We may also look into how\nmuch training data is required to effectively miti-\ngate bias in these language models and what types\nof training data work best. Finally, we want to\ninvestigate the limitations of such methods and in-\nquire if any prejudice is embedded in the model\nbeyond what we measured in our initial experi-\nments.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by NSF/Intel Part-\nnership on Machine Learning for Wireless Net-\nworking Program under Grant No. CNS-2003129,\nand the Understanding and Reducing Inequalities\nInitiative of the University of Wisconsin–Madison,\nOffice of the Vice Chancellor for Research and\nGraduate Education with funding from the Wiscon-\nsin Alumni Research Foundation.\nReferences\nJosh Abramson, Arun Ahuja, Iain Barr, Arthur Brussee,\nFederico Carnevale, Mary Cassin, Rachita Chhaparia,\nStephen Clark, Bogdan Damoc, Andrew Dudzik,\net al. 2020.
