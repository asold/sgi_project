    "abstract": "Optical Current Transformers (OCTs) and Optical Voltage Transformers (OVTs) are an alternative to the conventional transformers for protection and metering purposes with a much smaller footprint and weight. Their advantages were widely discussed in scientific and technical literature and commercial applications based on the well-known Faraday and Pockels effect. However, the literature is still scarce in studies evaluating the use of optical transformers for power quality purposes, an important issue of power system designed to analyze the various phenomena that cause power quality disturbances. In this paper, we constructed a temperature-independent prototype of an optical voltage transformer based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and piezoelectric ceramics (PZT), adequate to be used in field surveys at 13.8 kV distribution lines. The OVT was tested under several disturbances defined in IEEE standards that can occur in the electrical power system, especially short-duration voltage variations such as SAG, SWELL, and INTERRUPTION. The results demonstrated that the proposed OVT presents a dynamic response capable of satisfactorily measuring such disturbances and that it can be used as a power quality monitor for a 13.8 kV distribution system. Test on the proposed system concluded that it was capable to reproduce up to the 41st harmonic without significative distortion and impulsive surges up to 2.5 kHz. As an advantage, when compared with conventional systems to monitor power quality, the prototype can be remote-monitored, and therefore, be installed at strategic locations on distribution lines to be monitored kilometers away, without the need to be electrically powered.",
