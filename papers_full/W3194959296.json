However, most of the proposed\ntransformer variants highly demand storage, run-time memory, and\ncomputational resource requirements, which impede their wide\ndeployment on edge devices, e.g., robotics and mobile phones. Al-\nthough massive effective techniques have been developed for com-\npressing and accelerating convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nincluding low-rank decomposition [ 7, 20, 22, 33, 44], quantiza-\ntion [1, 11, 28, 28, 43], network pruning [ 14, 19, 34, 35, 42], and\nknowledge distillation [15, 21, 26, 29, 36], there still exists an ur-\ngency to develop and deploy efficient vision transformer.\nTaking advantage of different designs [17, 31, 46, 47, 49], trans-\nformer can be compressed and accelerated to varying degrees. AL-\nBERT [18] reduces network parameter and speed up training time\nby decomposing embedding parameters into smaller matrices and\nenabling cross-layer parameter sharing. Star-Transformer [10] spar-\nsifies the standard transformer by moving fully-connected structure\nto the star-shaped topology. Based on knowledge distillation tech-\nniques, the student networks in [ 17, 32] learn from the logits in\nthe larger pre-trained teacher networks. Some effective pruning\nalgorithms have been proposed to reduce the attention heads [27]\nor individual weights [ 9]. The previous methods focus on com-\npressing and accelerating the transformer for the natural language\nprocessing tasks. With the emergence of vision transformers such\nas ViT [ 8], PVT [ 40], and TNT [ 13], an efficient transformer is\nurgently need for computer vision applications.\nTo address the aforementioned problems, we propose to prune\nthe vision transformer according to the learnable importance scores.\nInspired by the pruning scheme in network slimming [23], we add\nthe learning importance scores before the components to be prune\nand sparsify them by training the network with L1 regulation.\nThe dimensions with smaller importance scores will be pruned\nand the compact network can be obtained. Experimental results\non the benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm. Our vision transformer pruning (VTP) method largely\ncompresses and accelerates the original ViT (DeiT) models. As the\nfirst pruning method for vision transformers, this work will provide\na solid baseline and experience for future research.\n2 APPROACH\n2.1 Transformer\nThe typical vision transformer architecture [8, 38] consists of Multi-\nHead Self-Attention (MHSA), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), layer\nnormalization, activation function, and shortcut connection. MHSA\nis the characteristic component of transformer to perform informa-\ntion interaction among tokens. In particular, the input 𝑋 ∈R𝑛×𝑑 is\ntransformed to query𝑄 ∈R𝑛×𝑑 , key𝐾 ∈R𝑛×𝑑 and value𝑉 ∈R𝑛×𝑑\nvia fully-connected layers, where 𝑛is the number of patches. 𝑑 is\nthe embedding dimension. The self-attention mechanism is utilized\nto model the relationship between patches:\nAttention(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉 )= Softmax\n\u0010\n𝑄𝐾T/\n√\n𝑑\n\u0011\n𝑉. (1)\nFinally, a linear transformation is applied to generate the output of\nMHSA:\n𝑌 = 𝑋 +FC𝑜𝑢𝑡 (Attention(FC𝑞 (𝑋),FC𝑘 (𝑋),FC𝑣 (𝑋))), (2)\nwhere the layer normalization and activation function are omitted\nfor simplification. As for the two-layer MLP, it can be formulated\nas\n𝑍 = 𝑌 +FC2(FC1(𝑌)). (3)\nIntuitively, the widely-used fully-connected layers in the trans-\nformer lead to computation and storage burden.\n2.2 Vision Transformer Pruning\nTo slim the transformer architecture, we focus on decreasing the\nFLOPs of MHSA and MLP. We propose to prune the dimension\nof the linear projection by learning their associated importance\nscores. For the features 𝑋 ∈R𝑛×𝑑 , where 𝑛 denotes the number\nof features that need to be pruned and 𝑑 denotes the dimension of\neach feature, we aim to preserve the generated important features\nand remove the useless ones from the corresponding components\nof linear projection. Suppose the optimal importance scores are\narXiv:2104.08500v4  [cs.CV]  14 Aug 2021\nMingjian Zhu, Yehui Tang, and Kai Han\nHuawei Confidential4\n0.95 0.820.320.120.020.880.780.250.660.860.17\nDimension Pruning\nLinear\nDimension Pruning\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\nDimension Pruning\nLinear\nLinear\nDimension Pruning\nLinear\nDimension Pruning\nSoft gate\nHard gate\nFeatures n\nd\nFigure 1: Vision Transformer Pruning.\na∗ ∈{0,1}𝑑 , that is, the scores for generated important features\nand their corresponding components are ones while the scores for\nuseless ones are zeros. With the importance scores, we can obtain\nthe pruned features:\n𝑋∗= 𝑋diag(a∗). (4)\nHowever, it’s hard to optimize a∗in the neural network through\na back-propagation algorithm due to its discrete values. Thus, we\npropose to relax a∗ to real values as ^ a∈ R𝑑 . The soft pruned\nfeatures are obtained as\n^𝑋 = 𝑋diag(^ a) (5)\nThen, the relaxed importance scores ^ acan be learned together with\nthe transformer network end-to-end. In order to enforce sparsity\nof importance scores, we apply ℓ1 regularization on the importance\nscores: 𝜆∥^ a∥1 and optimize it by adding on the training objective,\nwhere 𝜆is the sparsity hyper-parameter. After training with sparsity\npenalty, we obtain the transformer with some importance scores\nnear zero. We rank all the values of regularized importance scores in\nthe transformer and obtain a threshold𝜏according to a pre-defined\npruning rate. With the threshold 𝜏, we obtain the discrete a∗by\nsetting the values below the threshold as zero and higher values as\nones:\na∗= ^ a≥𝜏. (6)\nAfter pruning according to the importance scores a∗, the total\npruned transformer is fine-tuned to diminish the accuracy drop.\nThe above pruning procedure is denoted as\n𝑋∗= Prune(𝑋). (7)\nAs shown in Figure 1, we apply the pruning operation on all\nthe MHSA and MLP blocks. The pruning process for them can be\nformulated as\n𝑄,𝐾,𝑉 = FC′\n𝑞 (Prune(𝑋)),FC′\n𝑘 (Prune(𝑋)),FC′\n𝑣 (Prune(𝑋)), (8)\n𝑌 = 𝑋 +FC′\n𝑜𝑢𝑡 (Prune(Attention(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉 ))), (9)\n𝑍 = 𝑌 +FC′\n2(Prune(FC′\n1(Prune(𝑌)))). (10)\nwhere FC′𝑞,FC′\n𝑘,FC′𝑣,FC′\n𝑜𝑢𝑡 ,FC′\n1, and FC′\n2 are pruned linear projec-\ntion corresponding to the pruned features and a∗. The proposed\nvision transformer pruning (VTP) method provides a simple yet\neffective way to slim vision transformer models. We hope that this\nwork will serve as a solid baseline for future research and provide\nuseful experience for the practical deployment of vision transform-\ners.\n3 EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed VTP\nmethods to prune vision transformer models on ImageNet dataset.\n3.1 Datasets\nImageNet-1K.. ImageNet ILSVRC2012 dataset [30] is a large-scale\nimage classification dataset including 1.2 million images for train-\ning and 50,000 validation images belonging to 1,000 classes. The\ncommon data augmentation strategy in DeiT [ 37] is adopted for\nmodel development, including Rand-Augment [6], Mixup [48], and\nCutMix [45].\nImageNet-100. ImageNet-100 is collected as a subset of ImageNet-\n1K. We first randomly sampled 100 classes and their corresponding\nimages for training and validation. We adopt the same data aug-\nmentation strategy for ImageNet-100 as ImageNet-1K.\n3.2 Implementation Details\nBaseline. We evaluate our pruning method on a popular vision\ntransformer implementation, i.e., DeiT-base [ 37]. In our experi-\nments, a 12-layer transformer with 12 heads and 768 embedding\ndimensions is evaluated on both ImageNet-1K and Imagenet-100.\nFor a fair comparison, we utilize the official implementation of DeiT\nand do not use techniques like distillation. On the ImageNet-1K, we\ntake the released model of DeiT-base as the baseline. We finetune\nthe model on the ImageNet-1K using batch size 64 for 30 epochs.\nThe initial learning rate is set to 6.25 ×10−7. Following Deit [37],\nVision Transformer Pruning\nTable 1: Ablation Study on ImageNet-100.\nSparse Penalty Pruning Rate Params (M) Params Reduced FLOPs (B) FLOPs Reduced Top1 (%)\n0.0001\n0.6 29.0 ↓66.4% 6.4 ↓63.5% 90.00\n0.5 38.0 ↓56.0% 8.2 ↓53.4% 91.46\n0.4 47.3 ↓45.3% 10.0 ↓43.0% 92.58\n0.2 66.1 ↓23.5% 13.7 ↓22.0% 93.54\n0.00001\n0.6 28.2 ↓67.4% 6.3 ↓64.4% 89.88\n0.5 37.5 ↓56.6% 8.1 ↓54.0% 91.40\n0.4 47.1 ↓45.5% 10.0 ↓43.2% 92.38\n0.2 66.1 ↓23.5% 13.7 ↓22.0% 93.44\nTable 2: Results on ImageNet-100.\nModel Params (M) FLOPs (B) Top1 (%) Top5 (%)\nDeit-B (Baseline) 86.4 17.6 94.50 98.94\nVTP (20% pruned) 66.1 13.7 93.54 98.36\nVTP (40% pruned) 47.3 10.0 92.58 98.04\nTable 3: Results on ImageNet-1K.\nModel Params (M) FLOPs (B) Top1 (%) Top5 (%)\nCNN based\nResNet-152 60.2 11.5 78.3 94.1\nRegNetY-16GF 83.6 15.9 80.4 -\nTransformer based\nViT-B/16 86.4 55.5 77.9 -\nDeiT-B (Baseline) 86.4 17.6 81.8 -\nVTP (20% pruned) 67.3 13.8 81.3 95.3\nVTP (40% pruned) 48.0 10.0 80.7 95.0\nwe use AdamW [25] with cosine learning rate decay strategy to\ntrain and finetune the models.\nTraining with Sparsity Regularization and Pruning. Based on the\nbaseline model, we train the vision transformer with ℓ1 regular-\nization using different sparse regularization rates. We select the\noptimal sparse regularization rate (i.e. 0.0001) on Imagenet-100 and\napply it on ImageNet-1K. The learning rate for training with sparsity\nis 6.25 ×10−6 and the number of epochs is 100. The other train-\ning setting follows the baseline model. After sparsity, we prune\nthe transformer by setting different pruning thresholds and the\nthreshold is computed by the predefined pruning rate, e.g., 0.2.\nFinetuning. We finetune the pruned transformer with the same\noptimization setting as in training, except for removing the ℓ1 reg-\nularization.\n3.3 Results and Analysis\nImagenet-100 Experiments and Ablation Study. We firstly conduct\nablation studies on Imagenet-100, as shown in Table 1. From the\nresults, the amount of pruning rate matches the ratio of parameters\nsaving and FLOPs saving. For example, when we prune 40% dimen-\nsions of the models trained with 0.0001 sparse rate, the parameter\nsaving is 45.3% and the FLOPs saving is 43.0%. We can see that the\nParameters and FLOPs drop while the accuracy maintains. Besides,\nthe sparse ratio does not highly influence the effectiveness of the\npruning method. In Table 2, we compare the baseline model with\ntwo VTP models, i.e., 20% pruned and 40% pruned models. The\naccuracy drops slightly with large FLOPs decrease. When we prune\n20% dimensions, 22.0% FLOPs are saved and the accuracy drops by\n0.96%. When we prune 40% dimensions, 45.3% FLOPs are saved and\nthe accuracy drops by 1.92%.\nImagenet-1K Experiments. We also evaluate the proposed VTP\nmethod on the large-scale ImageNet-1K benchmark. The results are\nshown in Table 3. Compared to the base model DeiT-B, the accuracy\nof VTP only decreases by 1.1% when 40% dimensions are pruned.\nThe accuracy only drops by 0.5% while 20% dimensions are pruned.\nThe effectiveness of VTP can be generalized to large-scale datasets.\n4 CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we introduce a simple yet efficient vision transformer\npruning method. L1 regulation is applied to sparse the dimen-\nsions of the transformer and the important dimensions appear\nautomatically. The experiments conducted on Imagenet-100 and\nImageNet-1K demonstrate that the pruning method can largely\nreduce the computation costs and model parameters while main-\ntaining the high accuracy of original vision transformers. In the\nfuture, the important components such as the number of heads and\nthe number of layers can also be reduced with this method, which\nis a promising attempt to further compress vision transformers.\nMingjian Zhu, Yehui Tang, and Kai Han\nREFERENCES\n[1] Zhaowei Cai, Xiaodong He, Jian Sun, and Nuno Vasconcelos. 2017.
