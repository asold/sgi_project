    "abstract": "Microtools require exceptionally high-quality surface features controlled to the nanometer level. The specialized cylindrical desktop grinder we designed with electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID) features two opposed grinding-wheel heads arranged to pinch the workpiece. Grinding performance was demonstrated in fabricating staged pins with an end diameter of 50 microns and an aspect ratio of 30, together with other polygonal shapes, including quadrangular, hexagonal, and octagonal cross-sections. Satisfactory results were also achieved using microtools produced with this grinder for fine milling experiments involving the fabrication of microgrooves and micromolds.",
