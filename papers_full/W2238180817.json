INTRODUCTION \nOil chromatographic analysis (DGA) is the main \nmethod for status detection and fault diagnosis of a \ntransformer. Based on study and analysis of existing \ninternational technologies, reducing a status detection and \ndiagnostic system ’s complexity, increasing the \ninformation collect ed by the system, and obtaining the \noptimization balance between the two are the development \ntrends of online monitoring of power transformer s, which \nis key to improv ing a system’s performance. In China, \ntransformer fault diagnosis technology is mainly based on \nexperimental data, using artificial intelligence and expert \nsystems. Castro applied fuzzy theory to fault pattern \nrecognition and information recognition to deal with the \nuncertain and incomplete information and data effectively. \nRacoceanu presented a new fault diagnosis method for \ntransformers. Although to a certain extent it can solve the \ncontradiction between diagnosis system complexity and \nthe system acquisition information, it is still difficult to \nmap relation ships between the high dimensional \ninformation parameter space and the state space. \nThis paper combines rough set  theory and an improved \nPetri network, applies a rough set to the effective \nreduction of monitoring information, uses an improved \nPetri network to conduct diagnostic analysis, and applies \nthis method to the complex changes in transformer fault \ndiagnosis. \nII. R\nOUGH SET THEORY SUMM ARY \nRough set refers to sample sets {x 1, x2, ..., xn}, sample \nattribute sets , and attribute range system s as the \ninformation system, expressed as A. If the attribute set can \nbe divided into the condition attribute set L and decision \nattribute set D, a decision system can be constructed  as \nrough set constructs sample data in the form of table s, in \nwhich the rows represent sample individuals and the \ncolumns represent attributes . T his table can be called a \ndecision table, which is the expression of a  decision \nsystem form. When it comes to pattern classification \nproblems, we refer to conditional attributes as \ndiscrimination factors, and decision attributes present \ncategories of sample individual s. Classification is used to \ndetermine the individual category by the individual \ncondition attribute values, namely the decision attribute \nvalues. \nAccording to the collected  data and information, we \nestablished a multiple attribute information system, use d \nrough set theory to deal with the decision table, and then, \naccording to the following steps , created a vertical \nreduction of a decision table: \na.   Deleting the repeated rules in the table; \nb. Eliminating redundant condition attribute s in the \ntable; \nc. Reducing the decision rule, that is deleting redundant \nattributes of the classification rules; \nd. Minimizing decision -making algorithm s further and \nremoving redundant decisio ns from the simplified \ndecision-making table; \ne. Deci ding activities based on the decision rules we \nhave found. \nThrough the above process, we can reset the remaining \nproperties, simplify them on the horizontal level, calculate \nthe attribute ’s importance, and obtain a reduced set of \ndecision tables. \nIII. I\nMPROVED PETRI NET METHOD \nA. Traditional Petri Net \nPetri net is an important theory in the field of fault \ndiagnosis, mainly including place, transition , and arc. It \nrepresents a system model by net graph s to describe \nparal\nlel or sequential system events. In the complex \nsystem model, a Petri net is applied when a model state \nspace complexity problem exists, appearing as it increases \nexponentially with the increase of actual system size . In \naddition, a traditional Petri net has problems such as \nconflict, collision, and a deadlock. \niJOE ‒ Volume 11, Issue 8, 2015: \"Online Engineering Innovations based on Intelligent Information Processing\"\n25\nPAPER \nMETHOD BASED ON ROUGH SET AND IMPROVED PETRI NET FOR TRANSFORMER FAULT DIAGNOSIS \n \nB. Improved Petri Net  \nAn Improved Petri Net (IPN) is necessary to adapt to \nthe process and result s of the transformer state change \nevents, and the traditional Petri net is redefined. \nThe form of a decision table with an Improved Petri Net \nis as follows: \nU)M,G,W,J,E, T,(P,A =  \nHere P represents the event set, T represents the event \nchange set, event set , and change sets, respectively: \nP={Pi}, (i=1,2,...,n) and T={t j}, (j=1,2,...,m). E represents \nthe transfer event, which is related to the events change \ncaused by different event symptom s. A Petri Net library \nindicates an abnormal state when the token is 1, otherwise \nnormal. \nJ represents the capacity function, with the  form of P\u0001\n(0,1). W={w i}(i=1,2,...,n) is the weight function, !wi\u0002\nW:wi=1. \nG represents the time stamp set for change, G j(n) \nrepresents that the change G j ignites at the moment of \nafter ignition, G=G+{G j(n)}. Introducing  the time stamp \nset of change can identify the event propagation path  and \nat the same time prevent the ignition of change repeatedly. \nM represents the change time tag set. M 0={M0(P1), \nM0(P2),...,M0(Pn)} is called the initial identification, which \nrepresents the distributi on of an abnormal state in the \nsystem. In the development of an abnormal state in the \nsystem, each time change is identified as M1, M2,..., Mend. \nFor the Petri Net, the correlation matrix V=[v ij] is as \nfollows: \n)U V(M Mk 1 k ! \"=+                        (1) \nWhere M k, M k+1, respectively, represent the initial \nmarking set and result set for the change ignition at the K \nmoment; U represents the transition firing sequence at  the \nK moment, which is a n m column matrix composed of 0 \nand 1. T o make the state equa tion comply with the event \npropagation characteristics, it introduces an identity \noperator\" !\"and\" !\". \nb a u : R u , b , an l !=\" #$\n ,so: \nn i 1 ), b , a (i ii ! ! \"=u                        (2) \nWhere operator \" !\" takes the maximum value symbol. \n\" !\"is the logical and operator symbol, which means that \nthe value of v depends on the parameters of a and b. When \na and b are within 0 and 1, the value range of u is {0,1}. \nl nm n R U , R V!! \" \" #,so:  \n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n\"\n#\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n%\n&\n' (\n' (\n' (\n=\n!\n!\n!\n!\n\"\n#\n$\n$\n$\n$\n%\n&\n)\n!\n!\n!\n!\n\"\n#\n$\n$\n$\n$\n%\n&\n=)\n=\n=\n=\njnj\nm\n1 j\nj2j\nm\n1 j\nj1j\nm\n1 j\nm\n2\n1\nnmn2 n1\n2m22 21\n1m12 11\n, ,\n, ,\n, ,\nU V\nu v\nu v\nu v\nu\nu\nu\nv v v\nv v v\nv v v\n!!\n\"\n! # !\n\"\n\"\n       (3) \n\" ! \" is the logical multiplication operator symbol, \nwhich means the system state value may only transfer in \nthe associated event. By introducing the identity operator, \nthe complicated matrix operation  can be transferred into \nlogic operations or the addition operation, which \nsimplifies the process of calculation. \nIV. E\nXAMPLES \nThere are running records of power transmission and \ntransformation equipment in a certain area  from \nlongitudinal and transverse stati stics. T his is part of the \nvalue shown in Table I. Traditional fault analysis adopts a \nthree ratio method, the diagnosis results of which ha ve \nsmall deviation from the actual fault. By a three ratio \ncalculation, the corresponding fault state of each sample  \ndata can be obtained. \nTABLE I.   \nDETECTED FAULT DATA \nNo. \nFault feature parameters (µL!L-1) \nFault state H2 CH4 C2H6 C2H4 C2H2 CO CO2 Total  \nhydrocarbon \n1 147.20 20.70 10.90 76.00 6.00 220.80 2047.80 113.60 High temperature overheat \n2 19.00 431.00 214.00 772.00 0.00 996.00 2 087.00 1 417.00 High temperature overheat \n3 15.30 35.49 20.50 118.43 7.30 421.87 4769.60 182.17 High temperature overheat \n4 25.60 142.80 339.90 82.60 1.50 451.00 931.00 566.80 Low temperature overheat \n5 26.10 162.30 370.60 88.80 1.60 765.60 2 241.00 623.30 Low temperature overheat \n6 47.90 5.20 2.90 54.80 1.70 366.50 4 374.80 64.60 Low temperature overheat \n7 112.00 93.30 32.00 123.60 0.50 147.60 471.00 245.60 Middle temperature overheat \n8 179.00 323.00 184.00 393.00 0.00 1 032.00 2 415.00 899.00 Middle temperature overheat \n9 218.00 120.70 26.60 142.10 0.90 230.00 1 066.00 289.00 Middle temperature overheat \n10 141.00 131.00 13.00 139.00 19.00 513.00 1 558.00 302.00 Low energy discharge \n11 30.10 17.10 2.20 5.50 5.20 596.00 1 186.00 30.00 Low energy discharge \n12 44.30 21.50 7.10 98.70 76.70 288.60 2 761.00 204.00 Low energy discharge \n13 198.00 39.00 7.10 27.00 22.50 240.00 1 468.00 95.60 Low energy discharge \n14 410.00 32.99 2.59 24.79 191.15 406.00 1 519.00 284.51 High energy discharge \n15 86.13 31.82 8.58 8.52 21.05 564.48 4 536.00 69.97 High energy discharge \n26\nhttp://www.i-joe.org\nPAPER \nMETHOD BASED ON ROUGH SET AND IMPROVED PETRI NET FOR TRANSFORMER FAULT DIAGNOSIS \n \nThe key of a three ratio method is to compare the \nabsolute value of each gas in the sample data to analyze \nthe gas/ oil ratio in different failure modes based on the \nangle of relative change. The main objects of analysis are \nthe hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases. A lthough there are \nchanges in the ingredients of the carbon and oxygen \ncompounds, the impacts on the fault condition are not \nobvious. The r easoning model is not sufficient, so it is \noften expressed by expert experiences and other forms of \nrepresentation in the knowledge system. \nA. Optimization of parameters in condition monitoring  \nBased on the different working conditions of the \nmonitoring transformer s, sample s of different status can \nbe found. Through a trend discretization algorithm, we set \nthe decision table as shown in Table II. Among them , the \ncondition attribute is L={ l\nj}, 1 \u0002 j \u0002 5, respectively , \npresenting hydrogen l1, hydrocarbon gases (including total \nhydrocarbon) l2-6; the decision attribute is D={d j}, 1\u0002j\u00025, \nrespectively, representing an overheating fault (Q1\u0002300\u0001, \n300<Q2\u0002700\u0001, Q 3>700\u0001), and a discharge fault (low \nenergy discharge F 1, high energy discharge F 2). The limit \nvalues of the hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases are referred \n[9]. \nIn accordance with the reduction step for the decision \ntable, we calculate d the  significance of the attributes to \nfind the core of the decision table, said {c 1, c2, c4, c5}. To \navoid the missing of part of the association rules during \nthe reduction process, we chose { l1, l2, l 4, l5, l6} as the \nmeasurement parameters set, i.e. hydrogen, methane, \nethylene, acetylene, and total hydrocarbon, because there \nis a certain indiscernibility relation among carbon and \noxygen compounds and other gases. The importance is not \nhigh about the fault status. The measurement parameter \nset is not exclusive ; the  fault state space and parameter \nspace should construct reasonable mapping combined \nwith the actual situation. \nTABLE II.   \nTYPE SIZES FOR CAMERA-READY PAPERS \nNo. Condition attribute Decision attributes \nD l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 \n1 2 2 2 3 3 2 Q3 \n2 1 5 4 5 1 5 Q3 \n3 1 2 2 4 3 3 Q3 \n4 1 4 5 3 2 4 Q1 \n5 1 4 5 3 2 4 Q1 \n6 1 1 1 2 2 2 Q1 \n7 2 3 2 4 1 1 Q2 \n8 3 5 4 5 1 4 Q2 \n9 3 4 2 4 1 3 Q2 \n10 2 4 2 4 4 4 F1 \n11 1 2 1 1 3 1 F1 \n12 1 2 1 3 5 3 F1 \n13 3 2 1 2 4 2 F1 \n14 4 2 1 2 5 3 F2 \n15 4 5 5 5 5 5 F2 \n \nB.

The \nfailure condition is that the ontology oil ethylene content \nis relative high ; the local transformer is overheating, \nwhose type is high temperature overheating ; and the total \namount of hydrocarbon gas increases and the fault \naggravates. If the signs of the initial event are ethylene, \nacetylene and total hydrocarbon, the analysis results are \nthe same. The possible cause of the problem is the lead \nwire overheating or the drive pipe shunting . S uggestions \ninclude core grounding, insulation resistance tests, and dc \nresistance tests. L ift core checks occur if there are severe \ncases. The real failure of this sample is the transformer’s \nhigh temperature overheating . T hrough spot sampling \nanalysis and a tracking test, we found that gases in oil all \nhave significant growth. H2 changes relatively gently, but \nhydrocarbon gas content is relatively high . The results of \nthe survey are that the conductive material overheating  is \ncaused by the vortex, the lead heats up, and the insulation \nperformance degrades. \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nAn i mproved Petri net model, which is based on  a \nrough set, can identify association rules of multiple \nattributes implicated in complex systems and can conduct \ndiagnostic analysis of the concurrent and propagation \ncharacteristics of fault decision attributes, whose \nalgorithm has parallel reasoning ability . At the same time , \nit can find all the status values of a system after reasoning. \nUsing the change time tag set we can find a fault \npropagation path quickly and easily . It perfects the \ntransformer fault diagnosis method on the basis of a \ntraditional Petri network. \nREFERENCES \n[1] A. R. G. Castro, and V.
