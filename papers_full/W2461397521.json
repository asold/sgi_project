Tjelta (201 5) thoroughly explains the development of 77 \nsuction foundation technology including historical overview and main features. Currently, 78 \ninterest is growing for building extraPlarge, but still relatively light and very slender wind turbines 79 \nin deep waters. Compared to an oil platform, a larg e wind turbine has a small selfPweight. To 80 \nstand in deep water, a wind turbine can be supporte d on a multiPfoundation system. Thus, the 81 \nlarge horizontal loading coming from wind and waves  would be transferred to dominating axial 82 \nloads on each foundation. An optimal foundation des ign solution for extraPlarge wind turbines 83 \nshould be found, and it is not a straight forward p rocess for two reasons: firstly, the foundations 84 \nshould be costPeffective; and secondly, they should  be able to resist tensile loading. In some 85 \ncases, a longPterm cyclic tensile loading would be unavoidable unless the spacing between 86 \neach foundation is increased or an additional deadPload is placed.  87 \n 88 \nUntil today, a significant number of bucket foundat ion studies were performed at several 89 \nresearch institutes and universities, among the bes t known are Oxford University, Norwegian 90 \nGeotechnical Institute and Aalborg University. At A alborg University, monopod bucket 91 \nfoundations were analysed in detail by Feld et al. (1999 and 2000), Larsen et al. (2013), Foglia 92 \nand Ibsen (2013) and Barari et al. (2015).  93 \n 94 \nAn extensive study at Oxford University focussed on axially loaded suction caisson foundations. 95 \nIt included tests with caisson foundation models in different soils in a pressure chamber (Kelly et 96 \nal. 2003) as well as a largePscale field testing (K elly et al. 2006 a). Most of the times, the 97 \nperformed cyclic loading tests had mean compressive  loading and a small part of the loading 98 \namplitude was tensile; the highest number of cycles  was 1000. It was claimed that, to have a 99 \nsafe design, the highest tensile loading acting on a bucket foundation should be limited to the 100 \ndrained friction resistance (Kelly et al. 2003, 2004, 2006 a and 2006 b). Thus, the tensile capacity 101 \nwould consist of friction on the outer skirt, selfP weight of the structure and the lower of the soil 102 \nplug weight and the inner skirt friction. Byrne and  Houlsby (2006) stated that the tension on the 103 \nupwind foundation should be generally avoided. Howe ver, limited amount of model testing data 104 \nPage 3 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n3 \n \nis publicly available focussing on the cyclic tensi le loading on bucket foundations, especially 105 \nwith high cycle number and various mean tensile loads. 106 \n   107 \nA mediumPscale bucket foundation model, corresponding to 1:10 prototype size, was used for 108 \nthe testing of load, displacement and pore pressure  response in a 1 g testing rig. Cyclic loading 109 \nprogram consisted of up to 40,000 constant load amplitude cycles followed by a final monotonic 110 \npullPout quantifying the cyclic degradation of the frictional resistance. Furthermore, dimensional 111 \nanalysis on stiffness and displacement was applied according to Kelly et al. (2006 a). Through 112 \nthe physical model testing, this paper aims at visu alizing the bucket foundation behaviour under 113 \nlongPterm cyclic loading conditions. The influence of the axial tensile load on the displacement 114 \nand cyclic degradation is studied. 115 \n 116 \nEquipment and testing 117 \nQuasiPstatic and permanent loads, such as mean cyclic loads, induce drained conditions in soil. 118 \nUnder drained conditions, the tensile capacity of the bucket foundation corresponds to the dead 119 \nload of the structure and the frictional resistance  generated in the soilPstructure interface. 120 \nFurthermore, it is a lower bound solution for the t ensile capacity. This was taken as a starting 121 \npoint in the present model testing program which fo cussed on the drained response of the 122 \nbucket foundation model examined by a specially designed laboratory test setPup. 123 \n 124 \nThe laboratory test facility was launched in 2013 a nd presented for the first time by Vaitkunaite 125 \net al. (2014). The test setPup consisted of a large sand container, an installation, a loading frame 126 \nequipped with two hydraulic cylinders and an automa tic load regulation system. The tests 127 \npresented in this article were performed with bucke t foundation model of 1 m in diameter D, 0.5 128 \nm in skirt length d and 3 mm skirt thickness t, which corresponds to prototype foundation with 129 \nd/D  ratio 0.5. The bucket is made of steel and has a s elfPweight of 204 kg including the 130 \nconnection flange between the model and the load application point, see Fig. 1.  131 \n 132 \n 133 \nPage 4 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n4 \n \nSand  134 \nThe rigid sand container had an inner diameter of 2 .5 m. It was filled with 0.3 m of gravel used 135 \nfor drainage and 1.2 m of Aalborg University sand No. 1 (Fig. 1). The latter is quartz sand which 136 \ncontains a small part of biotite and feldspar. The small sand particles are subPangular while the 137 \nlarger particles are rounded. The main sand propert ies were as follows: specific grain density 138 \n2.64 g/cm 3, lowest void ratio emin  0.549, highest void ratio emax  0.858, 50%Pquantile 0.14 mm, 139 \nuniformity coefficient 1.78. Borup and Hedegaard (1 993) and Ibsen and Boedker (1994) 140 \nthoroughly reported the sand properties. Fig. 3 sho ws particle size distribution performed by 141 \nsieve analysis. The sand was saturated and compacte d to a planned density level before every 142 \ntest. Aalborg University sand No. 1 has a hydraulic  conductivity of 8×10 P5 m/s when prepared to 143 \nrelative density DR = 80%. Sjelmo (2012) performed a permeability anal ysis of Aalborg 144 \nUniversity sand No. 1 through a falling head apparatus.  145 \n 146 \nTesting procedure and data sampling 147 \nVaitkunaite et al. (2014) described testing procedure that was applied for this program. To begin 148 \nwith, the sand was loosened with an upward gradient . Afterwards, the sand volume was 149 \ncompacted by a rod vibrator. Later on, at least fou r smallPscale laboratory cone penetration 150 \ntests (CPT) were performed to inspect soil conditio ns. Larsen (2008) described the laboratory 151 \nCPT device and the methodology for the CPT interpre tation. Ibsen et al. (2009) estimated DR 152 \nfrom the laboratory cone resistance. Tests presente d in this article were performed in dense 153 \nsand with DR ≈ 80%, see Table 1.  154 \n 155 \nMechanical push installation of bucket foundation m odels was used by Kelly et al. (2003), Kelly 156 \net al. (2006 a) and Foglia (2015). Kelly et al. 2006 a compared installation by suction and pushing 157 \nand documented that the soil disturbance due to suc tion installation was more visible in smallP158 \nscale model tests, probably, because of local soil disturbances which do not increase in 159 \nproportion to caisson diameter. It is expected that  suction installation loosens soil in the inner 160 \ninterface zone and reduces the strength properties of soilPstructure interface in a shortPterm. 161 \nHowever, the properties are probably regained after some time due to small cyclic wave loading 162 \nwhich is typical in summer weather conditions.  Nie lsen (2016) performed laboratory tests with 163 \nPage 5 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n5 \n \nbucket foundation models. He showed that a bucket f oundation model gained 1.6 times larger 164 \nbearing capacity when prePloaded with small load cy cles. This study dealt with the foundation 165 \nmodel installed by mechanical pushing, because the focus was operational loading discharging 166 \nthe installation impact.  167 \n 168 \nInstallation started with positioning the bucket ri ght on the soil surface level, zeroing the signal 169 \nof the load cell and penetrating the bucket skirt d own to the soil with 0.2 mm/s velocity. Two 170 \nlarge valves were kept open during the installation  to let the air flow out. The installation ended 171 \nwhen approximately 70 kN force was reached. Right a fter that, the model was completely 172 \nunloaded. The installation required about 50 kN for ce from the hydraulic cylinder. An elastic 173 \ncompressive preload of 20 kN ensured that the bucke t was fully installed and kept the 174 \nprocedure repetitive (Fig. 4). In most of the cases , during the installation, the water table was 175 \nabout 3 cm above sand surface. During installation procedure, it was noticed that the load cell 176 \nreacted to the lid contact with the water table. In  a few tests, were the water table was at the 177 \nsame level of the sand surface, only one change in the response was noticed corresponding to 178 \nthe level of the soil surface. This means that the installation rate was slightly higher than would 179 \nbe required for completely drained soil response. H owever, the installation velocity was limited 180 \nby the equipment and could not be lower than 0.2 mm /s. Thus, bucket model was left to rest in 181 \nthe sand at least 2 hours allowing pore pressure di ssipation. Load and position signals were 182 \nmeasured during the installation process with sampling frequency of 1 Hz.  183 \n 184 \nThe testing program of the monotonic tensile loadin g and cyclic loading tests is presented in 185 \ndetails in the following section. Load, displacemen t and pore pressure responses were 186 \nmeasured during the tests. Load cell had a capacity  of 250 kN and was positioned right above 187 \nthe foundation model. Position of the hydraulic cyl inder piston was measured with a 188 \ndisplacement transducer. Additionally, two displace ment transducers were placed on the lid of 189 \nthe foundation model; they could measure displaceme nts of up to 125 mm. To analyse the 190 \ndrainage conditions, pore pressure response was mea sured at different levels on the model 191 \nskirt. Pore pressure transducers were placed above the bucket model and connected to 192 \nmeasuring positions via narrow waterPfilled pipes. As the cyclic tests typically took up to five 193 \nPage 6 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n6 \n \ndays, the atmospheric pressure changes were also me asured and separated from the pore 194 \npressure measurements. Fig. 2 shows all the mention ed transducers. Data sampling rate 195 \ndepended on the type of loading, i.e. 1 Hz frequenc y was chosen for monotonic loading tests 196 \nand 2 Hz frequency for cyclic loading tests.  197 \n 198 \nMOOG modular test controller was used to control an d monitor various loading regimes; for 199 \nexample, tension, compression and periodic loading with various force or displacement 200 \namplitudes and frequencies. The system was able to work continuously for several days, which 201 \nwas important for the high cycle number loading tests.  202 \n 203 \nLoading program 204 \nBefore describing the loading program, it is worth mentioning that tensile loading, upward 205 \ndisplacement and suction pore pressure are marked w ith a negative sign or drawn on the 206 \nnegative axis.  207 \n 208 \nFor the presentation of the load cases, two paramet ers were used to characterise the cyclic 209 \naxial loading, i.e. ξA and ξm. Ratio ξA (eq. 1) describes the cyclic loading amplitude Fcyc  210 \nnormalized with reference monotonic tensile load  FTR. ξA takes a value from 0 to 1, where  Fcyc  211 \nequal to FTR  results in ξA=1 and the smaller Fcyc  results in ξA<1. The second parameter (eq. 2) 212 \nexpresses the ratio between the mean cyclic load  Fmean  and the reference monotonic tensile 213 \ncapacity FTR. ξm takes a value from P1 to 1, where mean tensile cyclic load equal to FTR  results in 214 \nξm=P1 while mean compressive cyclic load equal to |FTR | results in ξm=1. A perfect twoPway 215 \ncyclic loading with Fmean =0 results in ξm=0. Fig. 5 visualizes the mentioned loading parameters.  216 \n(1)   \nTR\ncyc\nA\nF\nF−=ξ    217 \n(2)   \nTR\nmean\nm\nF\nF−=ξ    218 \nPage 7 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n7 \n \nIn the first set of tests, the monotonic tensile ca pacity was measured. The tests were position 219 \ncontrolled with maximum vertical pullPout velocity of 0.002 mm/s which ensured that the soil 220 \nresponse was drained.  221 \n 222 \nThe second set of tests focussed on drained behavio ur of bucket foundation subjected to cyclic 223 \naxial loading. Sinusoidal cyclic loading with const ant amplitude and mean load was applied on 224 \nthe model. Loading frequency f was 0.1 Hz, except in one test presented in this paper where the 225 \nfrequency was 0.05 Hz. Each time, the testing progr am consisted of more than 20,000 load 226 \ncontrolled cycles followed by a position controlled monotonic pullPout FPc .  227 \n 228 \nTest results 229 \nAll monotonic tensile loading tests showed very sim ilar behaviour and similar tensile peak 230 \nresistance. Pore pressures did not exceed 1.3 kPa d uring the loading sequence (Fig. 6), which 231 \nwas within the measuring accuracy of the transducer s. Two different displacement rates were 232 \napplied in the four monotonic tests: two tests with  0.001 mm/s and two with 0.002 mm/s. No 233 \ninfluence on the pore pressure transducers was seen  for the different displacement rate tests. 234 \nThe displacement rate was extremely low for water s aturated sand and it took 1.4P2.8 hours to 235 \nlift the model only 10 mm. Thus the response was assumed to be drained. 236 \n 237 \nIt was noticed that the peak tensile load FT was reached within the first 6 mm upward 238 \ndisplacement (0.006D), which was followed by a continuous decrease in l oad resistance due to 239 \na decrease in the soilPstructure interface area and softening behaviour of the soil. The reference 240 \nmonotonic tensile resistance FTR  was chosen as the average of FT. 241 \n 242 \nThis paper presents five cyclic loading tests with mean tensile load, three tests with mean 243 \ncompressive load and one with zero mean load. Fig. 7 shows a cyclic loading test followed by a 244 \npostPcyclic monotonic pullPout. The bucket foundation model was allowed to move up to P65 mm 245 \nupwards (0.065 D). In Table 1, two tests are marked as “pulled”; it  refers to vertical upward 246 \ndisplacement of P65 mm.  247 \n 248 \nPage 8 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n8 \n \nIf no significant displacement rate and pore pressu re change were seen, then it was expected 249 \nthat there was no cycle that could exceed the drain ed tensile capacity. However, during four 250 \ncyclic loading tests, i.e. A0.3mP0.4:1, A0.3mP0.4:2, A0.7mP0.4:1 and A0.7mP0.4:2, pore pressure 251 \nbuild up during the loading sequence was noticed. L oading rate analysis showed that the pore 252 \npressure build up was present in the tests where the loading rate was higher than 0.77 kN/s and 253 \nmean tensile load was applied in the loading sequen ce (see Table 1). Pore water pressure 254 \nduring cyclic loading is addressed in section Pore pressure vs. cycles .  255 \n 256 \nSome of the tests are referred as critical loading tests or tests where a critical load is reached. 257 \nThe critical load in this loading program is the dr ained tensile resistance FTR . The drained soil 258 \nresponse is normally assumed for longPterm loading conditions. As the main subject of this 259 \ntesting program is drained soil response, the loads reaching FTR  are referred as critical.  260 \n 261 \nDisplacement vs. cycles 262 \nAll the tests had a tendency to either keep the buc ket in the initial position or develop upward 263 \ndisplacement. During tests with ξm=0.3 and ξA ≤0.7, the foundation model stayed in the initial 264 \nposition (A0.4m0.3, A0.7m0.3:1, A0.7m0.3:2). Very s mall upward displacements (<0.006 D) 265 \ndeveloped in tests with ξm ∈[P0.4, 0] and ξA ≤0.3 (A0.2m0, A0.3mP0.4:1 and A0.3mP0.4:2). Fig. 8 266 \nclearly shows that when critical loading was exceed ed P the tensile load reached  FTR P the 267 \nbucket eventually was pulled out (A0.7mP0.4:1, A0.7 mP0.4:2). However, the foundation model 268 \nhad to be subjected to more than 1,000 cycles of such critical loading to be lifted up to 0.05 D. 269 \n 270 \nTests A0.7mP0.4:1 and A0.7mP0.4:2 had identical loa ding conditions, but slightly different 271 \nbehaviour, the first test required 8 times more cyc les to lift the bucket model to P60 mm (Fig. 8). 272 \nObviously, the displacement rate was changeable in the tests A0.7mP0.4:2 while in      A0.7mP273 \n0.4:1 was rather constant. Furthermore, the inner p ore pressure in test A0.7mP0.4:2 decreased 274 \nconstantly (Fig. 13) whereas in the test A0.7mP0.4:1 it was around 0 kPa during the first 5,000 275 \ncycles (Fig. 14). This indicated that the accumulat ion of negative pore pressure resulted in 276 \nhigher displacement. As the loading rate was identi cal, it should be expected that slightly lower 277 \nsoil permeability (thus, higher DR) could result in the lower negative pore pressure of test 278 \nPage 9 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n9 \n \nA0.7mP0.4:2 compared to test A0.7mP0.4:1. Unfortunately, the density ratio was not estimated 279 \nfor the test A0.7mP0.4:2 due to technical issues. 280 \n 281 \nKelly et al. 2006b analysed incremental and cumulative cyclic displacement during one test with 282 \nmean compressive load (referred as Test15) and show ed that the incremental displacement 283 \ndecreased within the first 200 cycles and, afterwar ds, kept constant with a small positive value 284 \npushing the bucket model down to the soil at a constant rate. Positive incremental displacement 285 \nindicates a safe foundation design range, because the bucket cannot be lifted due to the loading 286 \nconditions.  287 \n 288 \nDuring the present testing campaign it was seen tha t in most of the examined cases the 289 \nincremental displacement wi.d  became constant within the first 200 loading cycles . Fig. 9 shows 290 \naccumulated and incremental cyclic displacement dur ing test A0.7m0.3:2. The incremental 291 \ndisplacement changed within the first 200 cycles an d continued almost constant with a very 292 \nsmall positive increment of 10 P6 mm until the end of the test. Within the first 200  cycles, the 293 \nmodel reached the uppermost position and, afterward s, it was slowly pushed downwards to the 294 \ninitial position (0 mm). The accumulated displaceme nt during this longPterm cyclic loading test 295 \nwas very small (<10 P3D). Similar behaviour was seen in tests A0.7m0.3:1 and A0.4m0.3.  296 \n 297 \nHowever, all tests with ξm≤0 resulted in negative incremental displacements, where average wi.d  298 \nwas in the range from P10 P7 mm to P10 P2 mm depending on loading conditions (see Table 2). 299 \nFurthermore, under the critical tensile loading, th e displacement increment varied during the 300 \nloading sequence, as seen in Fig. 10. Overall, the negative incremental displacements are 301 \nsmall, but they would eventually lead to an inadmis sible accumulated displacement of the 302 \nfoundation.  303 \n 304 \nPost-cyclic load 305 \nCyclic degradation is a very important factor that should be evaluated when designing offshore 306 \nfoundations. In this testing program, the cyclic degradation was evaluated comparing the virgin 307 \nloading response and the postPcyclic loading response. The measured monotonic load 308 \nPage 10 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n10 \n \ndecreased continuously due to a decrease in the soilPstructure interface area and softening 309 \nbehaviour. Thus, the corresponding shaft friction was calculated dividing the measured load by 310 \nthe area of the shaft in contact to soil (Fig. 11). The peak postPcyclic shaft friction was very 311 \nsimilar to or lower than the virgin shaft friction; in the performed tests, up to 25% difference in 312 \nthe peak capacity. The peak resistance was reached within the upward displacement of P10 313 \nmm, which corresponded to 0.01 D.  314 \n 315 \nPore pressure vs. cycles 316 \nShear and dilation occur when dense sands are subje cted to external loads. Negative pore 317 \npressure occurs if water is unable to flow into the  pores when the soil dilates. Dilation is 318 \nespecially high in low soil stresses (shallow depth ). As mentioned earlier, the negative pore 319 \npressure is limited by the cavitation.  320 \n 321 \nUntil now, no tensile high cycle number tests were performed measuring pore pressure 322 \nbehaviour at different depths of the bucket model s kirt. In this testing campaign, it was noticed 323 \nthat pore pressure depends not only on loading rate , but can also change/develop during longP324 \nterm cyclic loading as seen in Fig. 12 (test A0.3mP 0.4:2). It should be noted that any influence 325 \nfrom the atmospheric pressure change during the tes ts was removed from data, so it shows 326 \nonly the pore pressure state in the soil contact to  the foundation model, see also Fig. 2 for the 327 \npore pressure measuring positions.  328 \n 329 \nNo pore pressure development (thus, fully drained r esponse) was seen during full loading 330 \nprogram in tests A0.2mP0.4, A0.7m0.3:1, A0.7m0.3:2,  A0.4m0.3and A0.2m0. Small suction 331 \naccumulation during cyclic loading was visible in t ests A0.3mP0.4:1 and A0.3mP0.4:2 that were 332 \nsubjected to a higher loading rate of 0.77 kN/s and  mean tensile load (Table 1). The highest 333 \nmeasured pore pressure reached P8.5 kPa in test A0.7mP0.4:2 which was small compared to the 334 \ncavitation limit of P100 kPa (Fig. 12 and Fig. 13).  However, the generated suction pressure of P335 \n8.5 kPa under the bucket lid resulted in 6.7 kN res istance to tensile load which was larger than 336 \nFTR. As seen in Fig. 13, negative pore pressure was co ntinuously generated through all the 337 \nloading sequence. Due to measuring accuracy of the pore pressure transducers (+/P2 kPa) it is 338 \nPage 11 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n11 \n \nhard to say the exact time when drained behaviour c hanged to partially drained and the tensile 339 \nresistance was induced by negative pore pressure ad ditionally to the interface friction. 340 \nMoreover, the pore pressure transducers measured di fferent suction in different levels on the 341 \nbucket skirt, i.e. the inner part of the bucket was  subjected to more suction than the outer 342 \nindicating partial drainage conditions, see Figs. 2 and 13. As mentioned in section Displacement 343 \nvs. cycles , the accumulation of the negative pore pressures i nfluenced the displacements. 344 \nVaitkunaite et al. 2016 performed experimental anal ysis with a bucket foundation model in a 345 \npressure tank. The analysis confirmed that pore suc tion level is closely related to upward 346 \ndisplacement rate. More analysis of this matter was out of the focus of the present research.  347 \n 348 \nStiffness during monotonic and cyclic loading 349 \nMonotonic loading stiffness during the first 10% of  load, k10%  was  about 11 MN/m, see Fig. 15 350 \nfor the definition of stiffness. Peak loading stiff ness kpeak , from the beginning to the peak of the 351 \nload, was 1.1 MN/m. PostPcyclic tensile load resulted in rather high stiffness. Here k10%  was very 352 \nhigh, i.e. from 46 MN/m to 3300 MN/m, while the pea k loading stiffness kpeak  was from 1.0 to  353 \n7.3 MN/m. 354 \n 355 \nIt was noticed that cyclic loading and unloading st iffness were significantly higher than the 356 \nmonotonic loading stiffness and it had similar valu es to postPcyclic pullPout values of  k10% . 357 \nMoreover, the stiffness was rather constant during the loading sequence except tests        358 \nA0.3mP0.4:2 and A0.7mP0.4:2, where the stiffness dropped at some point. Fig. 16 shows that 359 \ntest A0.7m0.3:2 unloading stiffness kcyc  was about 230 MN/m (mean). On the contrary, kcyc  was 360 \nquite low (only 24 MN/m) in test A0.7mP0.4:2 where large tensile loading dominated. Clear 361 \nstiffness degradation during cyclic loading was vis ible only when critical tensile cyclic loading 362 \nwas applied and no degradation in other loading cases.  363 \n 364 \nKelly et al. 2006a performed cyclic loading tests w ith mean compressive load and showed that 365 \nunloading cyclic stiffness had no degradation durin g cyclic loading, i.e. it was constant or 366 \nincreasing during the loading sequence. Such tenden cy is confirmed with the present tests, 367 \nexcept when critical tensile cyclic loading was applied (tests A0.7mP0.4:1 and A0.7mP0.4:2).  368 \nPage 12 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n12 \n \n 369 \nDimensional analysis 370 \nKelly et al. 2006 a provided equations for comparison of laboratory an d field tests which 371 \nindicated that the method used for data normalizati on was very successful. Indeed, the study 372 \nshowed good comparability of stiffness in any of th e cycles. However, accumulation of 373 \ndeformation during the cyclic loading (90 cycles) h ad smaller similarity when comparing 374 \nlaboratory and field test data. Analysis of vertica lly loaded caissons showed that disturbance 375 \ndue to suction installation was less important for field caisson. It is worth mentioning that the 376 \ndimensional analysis was applied to test data with foundation models having 0.15, 0.2 and 1.5 377 \nm diameter while the present study analyses a found ation model with 1 m in diameter. 378 \nMoreover, the loading conditions were quite differe nt compared to the present study, since 379 \nherein more attention is given to the tensile loadi ng. Model testing data provides valuable 380 \nknowledge for the fullPscale foundation design. The refore, the application of the theoretical 381 \nbackground is of interest. 382 \n 383 \nFig. 17 shows the first, middle and last cycles of the corresponding loading sequence in the 384 \nnormalized space. It is clearly seen that test with  mean compressive loading (A0.7m0.3:2) 385 \npresented significantly stiffer behaviour compared to test with mean tensile loading          386 \n(A0.7mP0.4:2). Softer behaviour of an axially loade d bucket foundation model in tension was 387 \nalso noticed by Kelly et al. 2006 a. Actual unloading stiffness is plotted in Fig. 18 which shows 388 \nthat the unloading stiffness was approximately 6.5 times higher in test A0.7m0.3:2. It is 389 \nimpossible to compare directly Kelly et al. 2006 a results to the present data, because the load 390 \namplitudes herein are much smaller. The softer beha viour of tensile loading tests with negative 391 \nFmean  resulted in progressive uplift of the foundation mode is as seen in Fig. 19.  392 \n 393 \nConclusions 394 \nThe study drew attention to the cyclic tensile load ing on a bucket foundation model. The paper 395 \npresented results from four monotonic and nine cycl ic loading model tests where several tests 396 \nhad a mean tensile load which has not been publical ly documented until now. The medium 397 \nscale bucket foundation model, corresponding to 1:1 0 prototype size, was subjected to large 398 \nPage 13 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n13 \n \nnumber of load cycles with various mean loads. Cont inuous measurements of load, 399 \ndisplacement and pore pressures visualized the actu al tensile loading behaviour. Based on the 400 \nperformed laboratory tests, the following findings can be drawn: 401 \n• Displacement during longPterm cyclic loading: All the tests had a tendency to either 402 \nkeep the bucket in the initial position or develop upward displacement. During tests with 403 \nξm from P0.4 to 0.3 and ξA≤0.3, the accumulated displacement was smaller than 0.006 D. 404 \nTests with ξm=P0.4 and ξA=0.7 resulted in gradual pullPout. However, the fou ndation 405 \nmodel had to be subjected to more than 1,000 cycles  of such critical loading to be lifted 406 \nup to 0.05 D. 407 \n• A constant negative incremental displacement devel oped in the tests with ξm≤0 which 408 \nindicated that the bucket foundation would be event ually moved to an inadmissible 409 \nupward displacement.  410 \n• Pore pressure during longPterm cyclic loading: Neg ative pore pressures developed 411 \nduring four tests indicating partially drained behaviour. Consequently, it was noticed that 412 \npore pressure can continuously accumulate during longPterm cyclic loading. 413 \n• Cyclic loading stiffness during longPterm cyclic l oading: During tests where the mean 414 \ncompressive loading dominated, the cyclic unloading  stiffness was higher compared to 415 \ntests where mean tensile loading dominated. General ly, cyclic stiffness was much 416 \nhigher than monotonic loading stiffness. Clear stif fness degradation during cyclic 417 \nloading was visible only when critical tensile cycl ic loading was applied and no 418 \ndegradation in other loading cases. Unloading stiff ness was slightly higher compared to 419 \nloading stiffness. 420 \n• Cyclic degradation: The peak postPcyclic shaft fri ction was very similar to or lower than 421 \nthe virgin shaft friction; in the performed tests, up to 25% difference in the peak 422 \ncapacity. The peak tensile resistance was reached within upward displacement of 1% of 423 \nbucket diameter (0.01 D).   424 \n• Dimensional analysis by Kelly et al. 2006 a was applied and visualized well the different 425 \ntrends in the tests for load, displacement and cyclic stiffness development. The 426 \nPage 14 of 39\nhttps://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cgj-pubs\nCanadian Geotechnical Journal\nDraft\n14 \n \ndimensional analysis can be validated only performing similar loading program on 427 \nbucket foundation models of different size.   428 \n 429 \nAcknowledgements 430 \nThe research was sponsored by project “Cost Effective Foundation and Installation of Wave 431 \nEnergy Converters” through the program ForskEl.
