    "abstract": "Abstract Graphical genome maps are widely used to assess genome features and sequence characteristics. The CGView (Circular Genome Viewer) software family is a popular collection of tools for generating genome maps for bacteria, organelles and viruses. In this review, we describe the capabilities of the original CGView program along with those of subsequent companion applications, including the CGView Server and the CGView Comparison Tool. We also discuss GView, a graphical user interface-enabled rewrite of CGView, and the GView Server, which offers several integrated analyses for identifying shared or unique genome regions relative to a collection of comparison genomes. We conclude with some remarks about our current development efforts related to CGView aimed at adding new functionality while increasing ease of use.",
