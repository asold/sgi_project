  "abstract": "Abstract Implementation of stationary systems of continuous monitoring technical state of power transformers is considered to be an important and relevant task. The paper provides a summery on the systems implemented at transformers of OJSC Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works. It characterizes the transformer of the power generating set of the thermal power plant equipped with the system for monitoring technical state. It lists diagnostic methods and offers an integrated system structure. The monitoring system is based on TDM package developed by OAO Dimrus. As a device for oil condition control, the Hydran M2 analyzer identifying gases dissolved in oil was used. Functions of separate modules, their version and arrangements are under consideration. The system interface is characterized, too. The main screen of controlled parameter of the transformer is provided in Inva-format. There is a challenge to develop methods for fault localization and identification based on the total of diagnostic features. The paper highlights a practical need for investigation of discharge activity with portable devices for control of partial discharges.",
