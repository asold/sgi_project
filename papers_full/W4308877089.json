  "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems have found diverse applications in fulfilling the increasing energy demand worldwide. Transformer-less PV inverters convert the DC energy from PV systems to AC energy and deliver it to the grid through a non-isolated connection. This paper proposes a new transformer-less grid-connected PV inverter. A closed-loop control scheme is presented for the proposed transformer-less inverter to connect it with the power grid. The proposed transformer-less inverter reduces extra leakage current and holds the common-mode voltage at a constant point. To eliminate extra leakage current, as well as achieve constant common-mode voltage, a midpoint clamping method is utilized to operate the inverter. The proposed transformer-less inverter is formed of seven insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) employing a unipolar sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) technique for switching purposes. An LCL filter is employed to reshape the two-level inverter output voltage and current to obtain closer sinusoidal waveforms. The output voltage and current total harmonic distortion (THD) of the proposed transformer-less inverter were found to be 1.25% and 0.94%, respectively, in the grid-connected mode. The leakage current elimination mechanism with the proposed transformer-less inverter is deeply analyzed in this paper. The performances of the proposed transformer-less inverter were evaluated with MATLAB/Simulink simulation and validated in a laboratory scale experiment.",
