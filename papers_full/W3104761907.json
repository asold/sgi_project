INTRODUCTION\nHigh power transformers (HPT) are one of the most expensive\nequipment of electricity Transmission Systems (TS). Also,\nthe reliability of these systems depends importantly on HPT’s\nsuitable performance, [1]. For that reason, any proposed\nimprovement of these electrical machines that could affect to\nthese evaluation criteria (cost and reliability) must be deeply\ntested before their ﬁnal implementation.\nThese static electrical machines are usually cooled by\nmineral oil. In fact, the HPT ﬂeets of TS use this liquid\ndue to its proven reliability from the dielectric and cooling\nstandpoint, [2]. However, the replacement of this type of\nliquid by others with better environmental and ﬁre safety\nproperties is currently being studied. These alternative liquids\nare ester-based and are produced from harvest products such\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Gang Mei\n.\nas soybean, palm, rapeseed, sunﬂower..., [3]. In fact, several\nstudies can be found in the scientiﬁc literature analyzing\ndifferent aspects of these new dielectric liquids. For instance,\nseveral authors have analyzed the impact of these liquids\non the aging of winding insulation paper since the trans-\nformer lifetime strongly depends on it, [4]–[7]. Also, the\ndielectric behavior of these ﬂuids has been also studied by\nother researchers, [7]–[9]. Finally, their cooling capacity is\ncurrently under study.\nRegarding the latter topic, the use of numerical tech-\nniques based on ﬁnite element method, e.g. Computa-\ntional Fluid Dynamics (CFD), has spread in the last two\ndecades. Many authors have used both commercial and non-\ncommercial codes to study the thermal-hydraulic behavior\nof the ﬂuid considering different type of winding geome-\ntries. For instance, several authors used a vertical cooling\nchannel conﬁguration to ensure both the cooling and dielec-\ntric insulation, [10]–[12]. By contrast, other works present\n207054 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/VOLUME 8, 2020\nR. Altayet al.: Use of Alternative Fluids in Very HPT: Experimental and Numerical Thermal Studies\na zig-zag oil channel conﬁguration in the winding cooling\nsystem, [13]–[19].\nHowever, all these works previously cited used mineral\noil as dielectric liquid. More recently, several authors have\nused this technique to analyze the cooling performance of\nthe new liquids in transformers. For instance, in 2015, Park\net al. compared the temperatures got in two 2D numerical\nmodels of two different 3-phase windings (power transformer\nof 66 kV , 16.5 MV A, with zig-zag cooling system and a\ndistribution transformer of 22 kV , 2.3 MV A with axial-radial\ncooling system) cooled with two types of ester-based alterna-\ntive liquids with those get with mineral oil. The considered\ncooling method was ON. The main conclusion of this work\nwas that the use of ester-based liquids highly increases the\nhotspot temperatures in the windings, [20]. In the same year,\nLecuna et al. carried out the same type of study using a 3D\nmodel of a power transformer of 66/6.3 kV , 14 MV A and\nONAN cooling in axial channels, reaching similar conclu-\nsions to those got in the previous work, [21]. Finally, in 2017,\nSantisteban et al. published a work in which a 2D axisymmet-\nric model of 25/26.4 kV , 66 MV A, ONAN/ONAF transmis-\nsion transformer with zig-zag cooling, [22]. In contrast with\nthe previous results, those obtained in this work showed that\nthe hot-spot temperature was lower for the vegetal oils if min-\neral oil cooling system design was considered. Further sim-\nulations seemed to conﬁrm these results, not only by CFD,\nalso by Thermal Hydraulic Network Models (THNM) [23].\nIn short, few works about the cooling performance of\nthe alternative liquids in HPTs can be found. Also, these\nworks use different types of numerical models to analyze\ntransformers with different rated power and different type of\ncooling systems. Last but not least, the results of these works\nare not conclusive: in some cooling systems, the tempera-\ntures obtained with alternative liquids are higher than those\nobtained with mineral oil, [20], [21], and in the other case is\nthe opposite, [22], [23]. Therefore, more studies are needed to\nbetter understand the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the ester-\nbased dielectric liquids in HPTs.\nFollowing the above, this work presents the results of an\nexperimental thermal test and, also, a numerical study, allow-\ning the cooling performance comparison of two alternative\nliquids (synthetic and natural esters) with mineral oil. This\ncomparison has been done in the axial cooling system of the\nLow V oltage Winding (LVW) of a 100 MV A HPT. For this\npurpose, a 3D CFD model of this LVW has been developed.\nThe heat-run test of this transformer with mineral oil was\nused to validate the CFD model. Then, this model was used\nto compare the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the ester-based\noils with that of the mineral oil at rated power. As far as this\nresearch group know, this type of study has not yet carried\nout in transformers of this power rating and with this type of\ncooling system.\nNext sections present the experimental setup and the\nnumerical model developed to carry out the study. Then,\nthe model validation is carried out. Later, the numeri-\ncal results of the alternative liquids are compared with\nthose of the mineral oil. Finally, some conclusions are\ninferred.\nIn the other hand, a mesh independence test has been\ncarried out to check that the number of the elements does\nnot have inﬂuence in the results. A mesh with approximately\n38·106 hexahedral elements was ﬁnally used. Also, as can\nbe seen in Fig. 6, a boundary layers-type mesh with inﬂation\nwas used close to the walls of the cooling ducts to capture\nthe temperature and velocity gradients that occur in these\nparts. Finally, the average values of the aspect ratio, orthogo-\nnal quality and skewness are obtained to measure the mesh\nelement quality. These values are 6.18, 0.99, and 7·10 −3,\nrespectively.\nFIGURE 1. Thermographic photo of the transformer during the test\n(temperature in◦C). Source: [24].\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nA heat-run test has been carried in the three-phase power\ntransformer of 170/36 kV , 100 MV A, ONAN/ONAF shown\nin Fig. 1.\nA. GEOMETRICAL DESCRIPTION\nFig. 2 shows the two main windings of a phase: LVW in the\ninner part and High V oltage Winding (HVW) in the outer part\nof the ﬁgure.\nRegarding the LVW, as can be seen in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, it is\ncomposed of an internal cardboard cylinder (3 mm thick and\n792 mm of inner diameter) surrounded by 5 concentric layers\nwith 25 copper turns by layer. Each turn has 4 parallel plates\n(plate dimensions: 15.95 mm x 14.95 mm) that are wrapped\nwith a dielectric paper of 0.8 mm width. The copper layers\nare separated by means of 80 wooden sticks of 6 mm thick.\nThis way, 80 ducts of 3.1 degrees of amplitude are created\nbetween internal cylinder and ﬁrst layer, another 80 cooling\nchannels between the ﬁrst layer and the second layer, and so\non. Finally, the total height of the LVW is 1.634 mm.\nAs can be seen in the Fig. 4, the monitoring of the tem-\nperatures inside the LVW was performed using Fiber Optic\nSensors (FOSs) located in the inner part of the fourth layer of\nboth phases V and W (numbering from the inside part of the\nwinding), at approximately 100 mm of the top of the winding.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 207055\nR. Altayet al.: Use of Alternative Fluids in Very HPT: Experimental and Numerical Thermal Studies\nFIGURE 2. 3D drawing of a phase and detail of the LVW.\nFIGURE 3. Geometrical information of the phase.\nThe accuracy of these sensors is ±1 ◦C. Also, according the\nIEC Standard 60076-2 [25], the ambient temperature was\nmeasured using 4 thermocouple sensors located all around the\ntransformer (one in front each face of the tank, two meters\naway from its perimeter and from the cooling surfaces) at\nabout halfway height up the cooling surfaces. Finally, ther-\nmometers are placed in the thermometer pockets located in\nthe transformer cover but also in the inlet and outlet of the\ntransformer oil cooler. The temperature measurements were\nrecorded by a commercial datalogger. In addition, a commer-\ncial transformer Loss Measuring System was used.\nB. EXPERIMENTAL TEST PROCEDURE\nAs mentioned previously, a heat-run test has been carried out\nusing the previously described experimental setup, ONAN\ncooling and a commercial mineral oil. Short-circuit method\nis used to determine whether the oil and winding tempera-\ntures are in accordance with the standard speciﬁcations, [25].\nBefore starting the test (cold transformer), the sensors tem-\nperatures were measured and recorded. Then, the test was per-\nformed in two steps. The ﬁrst one was carried out supplying\nFIGURE 4. a) Fiber optic sensors installation. b) Plant drawing with the\nfiber optic sensors location.\nthe total losses (highest losses of the transformer). According\nto [25], the temperature registration was done regularly with\nan elapsed time between each measure (in this case, 60 min-\nutes) until reaching steady-state condition. This condition has\nbeen fulﬁlled when the rate of change of top-liquid temper-\nature rise has fallen below 1 K/h and has remained there for\na period of 3 h. Then, in the second step, the transformer is\nloaded with the rated current of the test tap position for one\nhour. Meanwhile, all temperatures continued to be measured.\nThe total test duration was 14 hours.\nIII. NUMERICAL MODEL\nThis section presents the description of the numerical model\nthat allows to study the heat transfer and ﬂuid mechanics\nphenomena that occur in the LVW of the transformer during\nits operation. A 3D section of the LVW of a phase of this\ntransformer is used in the CFD model since the highest\ntemperatures usually appears in this winding due to its highest\nelectric currents and its location in the inner part of the phase.\nThis way, the computational domain considered, the mesh\n207056 VOLUME 8, 2020\nR.

Meshing detail.\ndeﬁned, the governing equations involved, and the bound-\nary conditions applied in a steady state study of this model\nare presented. Also, material properties and computational\nrequirements are shown.\nA. COMPUTATIONAL DOMAIN AND MESH\nThe computational domain considers both the oil and solid\nparts of the 1/80 (4.5 degrees) of the LVW of a phase. This\nsimpliﬁcation is based on the replicability of this section\nallowing the drawing all the winding. As can be seen in Fig.\n5, ﬁve layers of copper conductors and six cooling ducts are\nonly considered. Also, bottom and top oil parts are shown in\nthe same ﬁgure. Finally, the cellulosic materials (cardboard\nand sticks) are not considered due to their very low thermal\nconductivity.\nOn the other hand, a mesh independence test has been\ncarried out to check that the number of the elements does\nnot have inﬂuence in the results. A mesh with approximately\n38·106 hexahedral elements was ﬁnally used. Also, as can\nbe seen in Fig. 6, a boundary layers-type mesh with inﬂation\nwas used close to the walls of the cooling ducts to capture\nthe temperature and velocity gradients that occur in these\nparts. Finally, the average values of the aspect ratio, orthogo-\nnal quality and skewness are obtained to measure the mesh\nFIGURE 7. Physical properties of the three dielectric oils.

GOVERNING EQUATIONS\nThe ﬁnite volume-based numerical method solves the\nNavier–Stokes equations, which state the conservation of\nmass, momentum and energy for a ﬂuid ﬂow. For an incom-\npressible ﬂuid (oils can be considered this way), the equa-\ntions that state mass, momentum, and energy conservation\nare (1-3). On the other hand, for the solid domain, the equa-\ntion that state energy conservation is (4).\n∇·(ρu) =0 (1)\nVOLUME 8, 2020 207057\nR.

The latter\nrepresents the force that drives the ﬂow in natural convection\nregime and it is related to density gradients in the ﬂuid. Also,\nthe right-hand second term of (4) represents the heat source\n(in this case, the heat losses in the 3D section of the LVW\nconsidered, 0.275 kW).\nFollowing the assumptions of other authors, [14]–[16],\n[22], since the oil velocities in the channels are low (bulk\nvelocity in the hydraulic circuit smaller than 100 mm/s), it is\nconsidered a laminar ﬂow to solve (1-3).\nC. SIMULATION PARAMETER\nThis subsection presents the material properties involved in\nthe model and boundary conditions considered.\n1) MATERIAL PROPERTIES\nThe physical properties of the oils considered in the model\nsolved are presented in Fig. 7 with their mathematical\nexpressions. These expressions depend on the temperature\nexpressed in Kelvin and are calculated using data that are\navailable in public datasheets since all the liquids are com-\nmercial oils.\nOn the other hand, as shown in Fig. 5, the turns of the\nwinding layers are made of Continuously Transposed Con-\nductors (CTC). This type of conductor is made with several\ncopper plates that are wrapped all of them with an insulation\npaper, [26]. The thermal conductivity of this CTC is modelled\nwith an equivalent value that consider the same heat trans-\nfer behavior than the copper and paper arrangement, [27].\nAlso, this equivalent thermal conductivity of the conductor\nis orthotropic in cylindrical coordinates, with a radial, axial,\nand tangential conductivity of 1.5, 1.1 and 385 W/(m·K),\nrespectively. Finally, the other two thermal properties are\nconsidered with constant values: 381 J/(kg·K) for speciﬁc\nheat and 8978 kg/m 3 for density.\n2) BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\nIn this subsection, the boundary conditions used in the model\nare presented. First of all, the contact surfaces of the cel-\nlulosic materials (sticks and cardboard cylinders) with the\nﬂuids and with the electrical conductors are considered as\nadiabatic due to the very low thermal conductivity of these\ncomponents. In fact, they have been eliminated from the\nmodel. This way, the heat ﬂux to the outside of the winding\nis avoided, leading to a more conservative scenario, [13]. No-\nslip condition is used in the ﬂuid domain walls. A conjugate\nheat transfer model has been considered for the ﬂuid-solid\ninterface to enable the heat ﬂux from the winding conductors\nto the dielectric liquid. This way, the solvers couple the solid\nand ﬂuid domains from a thermal point of view. The heat\ngenerated in the LVW is modeled as a heat source in the\nconductors as it was explained in the previous section.\nRegarding the ﬂuid inlet and outlet conditions, following\nother works in this knowledge area, [14]–[16], an inlet veloc-\nity and an outlet pressure have been ﬁxed in order to give\ngood numerical stability to the solver. To get the ﬁrst value\n(0.00266 m/s), CFD and experimental results carried out by\nÖzben Kaymaz were used, [28]. This value was applied at\nthe bottom surface of the model. Regarding the second value,\na zero-gauge pressure was applied at the oil volume outlet\nlocated 30 mm from the top of the conductors of the LVW,\nat the upper right side. The exit location is based on the\nassumption that most of the oil ﬂows up following this path.\nFinally, an oil inlet temperature was considered, 337 K. This\ntemperature was obtained at the bottom of the transformer in\nthe heat-run test.\nD. COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS\nA second-order discretization was chosen to avoid diffusion\nerrors and the solver was set with double precision in a\ncoupled scheme. The convergence residuals accepted were\n207058 VOLUME 8, 2020\nR. Altayet al.: Use of Alternative Fluids in Very HPT: Experimental and Numerical Thermal Studies\nFIGURE 9.

This software\nwas run in a Dell PowerEdge R730 server using 36 processors\nat 2.30 GHz and 500 GB of RAM.\nIV. RESULTS\nExperimental and numerical results are presented in this\nsection. In a ﬁrst step, the ﬁrst ones are used to verify the\nvalidity of the numerical model. Then, once this validation\nhas been done, thermal-hydraulic behavior of the three dielec-\ntric liquids are compared using the numerical results.\nA. MODEL VALIDATION\nThe validity of the CFD model developed was carried out\nby comparison of the average temperatures measured by the\nFOSs in the test with that obtained in the same position of the\nmodel with mineral oil. The temperature calculated on the\nCFD model was 89.3 ◦C, whereas the average temperature\nobtained experimentally in steady state during the heat-run\ntest was 89 ◦C. This way, the CFD model is validated and it\nwill be used to compare the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the\nmineral oil with those of the ester-based oils.\nB. MINERAL OIL VS. ESTER OILS TEMPERATURES AND\nVELOCITIES\nAs can be seen in Fig. 8, the hot spots (the hottest temperature\nof winding conductors in contact with solid insulation or\ninsulating liquid, [25]) location of the three liquids is well\nabove the position of the FOSs in the real transformer. That\nis, the FOSs are not positioned where the hot spots appear.\nHowever, the temperature differences between both locations\nare not signiﬁcance.\nRegarding the layer in which hot spots are located, they\nare in the second layer in alternative liquids whereas in the\ncase of the mineral oil is in the innermost layer. This different\nFIGURE 10. Maximum (a) and Average (b) temperatures in CTCs’ layers.\nFIGURE 11. Temperature evolution with height in 3rd CTC layer.\nlocation can be explained using Reynolds (Re) number: both\ntypes of liquids have different Re numbers due to higher vis-\ncosity of ester-based oils, leading to different mass ﬂow rate\ndistribution through the axial ducts, as can be seen in Fig. 9.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 207059\nR. Altayet al.: Use of Alternative Fluids in Very HPT: Experimental and Numerical Thermal Studies\nFIGURE 12. Velocity profiles at the top of the winding.\nAs a result, hot spot locations changes for the alternative\nliquids.\nOn that same topic, Fig. 10 presents maximum and aver-\nage temperatures in CTCs’s layers. The highest hot spots,\nshowed in Fig. 8 and Fig. 10.a, are those belonging to ester-\nbased liquids, 91.2 and 91.8 ◦C. Nonetheless, there is not a\nsigniﬁcant difference between the hottest hot spot (synthetic\nester) and the coldest one (mineral oil), less than 2 ◦C. On the\nother hand, considering each liquid individually, the variation\nof the layers maximum temperatures is pretty small. That is,\nif it is considered the worst case, natural ester, a maximum\ndifference of 0.9 ◦C can be seen between layers. In the\nopposite case, mineral oil, this difference is not signiﬁcant,\n0.3 ◦C. This fact can be also seen even more pronounced\nwhen the average temperatures of the layers are considered,\nin Fig. 10.b. In fact, there is a slight variation of the mean\ntemperatures with the layer for each liquid. That is, regardless\nthe dielectric liquid considered, the cooling system of the\nwinding leads to uniform cooling of the layers, i.e. there is\nno bad cooling in one individual layer.\nMore thermal information is provided in Fig. 11, in which\nthe temperature evolution with height in the third layer of the\nwinding cooled by the best and worst coolant is shown. It is\nneeded to point out that the temperature evolution in the rest\nof the layers presents the same pattern. Three parts can be\nclearly distinguished in the curves. The ﬁrst one is that in\nwhich the ﬂow is thermally developing and the temperature\nof the CTC layer increase rapidly with height since the ﬂuid\nthermal layer is being developed and heat exchange between\nsolid and ﬂuid is bad. The second one (constant slope) is that\nin which the thermal layer of the ﬂow has been developed.\nAs a result, the temperature increases linearly with height in\nthis part of the winding. Another point to highlight of this part\nis that the alternative oil curve slope is smaller than that of the\nmineral oil, thus leading to higher temperatures. Finally, the\nthird one shows the temperature decrease due to the cooling\neffect of the top oil.\nFig. 12 presents the comparison of the velocity proﬁles\nof both ﬂuids, mineral oil and synthetic ester, at the top of\nthe winding. It can be appreciated that in both-side heated\nchannels the velocity proﬁles at the end of the duct shows a\nfully developed behavior.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn the present work, the cooling performance of three dielec-\ntric liquids (a mineral oil and two ester-based ﬂuids) in a\n100 MV A HPT with axial cooling system and ONAN cooling\nmode has been studied using a 3D CFD model of its LVW.\nThis model was successfully validated by comparing with the\nexperimental results of the transformer heat-run test.\nNumerical results show that all ﬂuids keep the winding\nlayers cooling uniformly although mineral oil is a slightly\nbetter coolant at rated power. This in due to the higher vis-\ncosity of biodegradable liquids, which negatively affects their\ncooling capabilities. However, the temperature increments in\nthe winding using alternative liquids regarding mineral oil are\npretty small.\n207060 VOLUME 8, 2020\nR. Altayet al.: Use of Alternative Fluids in Very HPT: Experimental and Numerical Thermal Studies\nIn accordance with the foregoing, ester-based liquids could\nbe used as substitute liquids of the mineral oils in this type of\nHPT when they are going to work in a range of powers close\nto the rated one.\nREFERENCES\n[1] V .
