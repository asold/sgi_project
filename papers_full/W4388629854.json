    "abstract": "Facial emotion recognition (FER) has a huge importance in the field of human–machine interface. Given the intricacies of human facial expressions and the inherent variations in images, which are characterized by diverse facial poses and lighting conditions, the task of FER remains a challenging endeavour for computer-based models. Recent advancements have seen vision transformer (ViT) models attain state-of-the-art results across various computer vision tasks, encompassing image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Moreover, one of the most important aspects of creating strong machine learning models is correcting data imbalances. To avoid biased predictions and guarantee reliable findings, it is essential to maintain the distribution equilibrium of the training dataset. In this work, we have chosen two widely used open-source datasets, RAF-DB and FER2013. As well as resolving the imbalance problem, we present a new, balanced dataset, applying data augmentation techniques and cleaning poor-quality images from the FER2013 dataset. We then conduct a comprehensive evaluation of thirteen different ViT models with these three datasets. Our investigation concludes that ViT models present a promising approach for FER tasks. Among these ViT models, Mobile ViT and Tokens-to-Token ViT models appear to be the most effective, followed by PiT and Cross Former models.",
