  "abstract": "Abstract: The Gemini MultiPDF Chatbot represents a groundbreaking advancement in natural language processing (NLP) by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with the Gemini Large Language Model. This innovative chatbot is designed to handle multiple document retrieval and generation tasks, leveraging the extensive knowledge base of the Gemini model. By harnessing RAG methods, the chatbot enhances its ability to acquire, comprehend, and generate responses across diverse knowledge sources contained within multiple PDF documents. The integration of Gemini's powerful language understanding capabilities with RAG facilitates seamless interaction with users, offering comprehensive and contextually relevant responses. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Gemini MultiPDF Chatbot, demonstrating its effectiveness in navigating complex information landscapes and delivering high-quality conversational experiences.",
