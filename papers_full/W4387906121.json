Inspired by the\nprogrammability of RNA-guided CRISPR genome editing\n5,i n\nrecent work, we have previously used linear motifs identiﬁed\nfrom the binding interfaces of bound co-crystal structures of\nprotein-protein interactions (PPIs) to serve as“guide” peptides\nfor subsequent generation of target-degrading uAbs2. However,\nour structure-based method relies on experimentally-validated\nco-crystals of target proteins, which exist for only <25% of the\nhuman proteome (Fig.1a). Gold-standard PPI databases contain\nbinder sequences to over 75% of the human proteome, and thus\nrepresent a rich source of information for guide peptide genera-\ntion (Fig. 1a)6– 8. As such, we hypothesize that leveraging PPI\ninformation to identify protein interaction sites from the\nsequence of a partner protein may enable more broad-scale\nprioritization of guide peptides for uAb-mediated TPD.\nIn this work, we apply protein language models (pLMs) to\nidentify binding motifs from input protein sequences, without the\nrequirement of three-dimensional protein structures. By accu-\nrately predicting these protein binding sites on veriﬁed interacting\npartners, we prioritize guide peptides for downstream uAb gen-\neration. To do this, we create a Structure-agnostic Language\nTransformer & Pep tide Prioritization (SaLT&PepPr) model\nbased on the state-of-the art ESM-2 pLM9, thatﬁrst predicts the\ninteraction sites along an input interacting partner sequence, and\nvia integration with PPI databases, enables isolation of con-\ntinuous guide peptide candidates for an input target protein. As a\nﬁrst proof-of-concept, we leveraged known interaction informa-\ntion to generate high-afﬁnity, speciﬁc peptide-guided degraders of\nβ-catenin, a core transcriptional regulator whose dysregulation\nfrequently leads to cancer cell proliferation10. We then showed\nthat SaLT&PepPr can effectively prioritize guide peptides to 4E-\nBP2 and TRIM8 in a data-driven manner, which were integrated\ninto the uAb architecture and found to induce target degradation.\nTRIM8-targeting uAbs, speciﬁcally, induced apoptosis in Ewing\nsarcoma cells, in line with previous genetic studies\n11. In total, our\nwork showcases how integrating natural protein interactions,\nbinding site prediction via pLMs, and genetically-encoded protein\nconstructs enables the rapid generation of uAbs for modular TPD\napplications.\nResults\nFine-tuned language model for interface prediction. We trained\na model to predict interaction sites on a given partner sequence\nfor a target protein. We based our model architecture on the 650-\nmillion parameter ESM-2 pLM, from Meta AI, which enables\nfeaturization of protein sequences without the need for multiple\nsequence alignment (MSA) generation9.W e ﬁne-tuned the ﬁnal\nthree layers of ESM-2 together with a multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) classiﬁcation head, where each protein sequence was\npassed to the model with a per amino acid binary class as the\ntarget, employing a binary cross entropy loss (Fig.1b). We trained\nand assessed our model separately on two datasets of PPI sites:\nthe protein-protein binding site (PPBS) dataset from ScanNet and\nour own PPI site data, derived using the PeptiDerive method on\nco-crystal structures in the PDB (Supplementary Fig. 1)12,13. For\nboth datasets, a nonhomologous test and validation set were used\nto assess the generalization of the model in predicting interaction\nhotspots.\nOverall, SaLT&PepPer exhibited robust performance on non-\nhomologous validation and test sets, demonstrating\ngeneralizability of our model. When trained and tested on the\nPDB-derived dataset, SaLT&PepPr achieved a test set area under\nthe ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.77 (Fig.1c). Alternatively, when\nkeeping ESM-2 weights frozen, the test AUROC was 0.7,\ndemonstrating the beneﬁto f ﬁne-tuning the ﬁnal layers of the\noriginal model. This approach, which utilizes the sequence of the\nbinding partner, has a Spearman correlation to PeptiDerive\nenergy scores of 0.4 on the test set with sequence homology <25%\n(Fig. 1c). We also trained and tested on the ScanNet PPBS dataset\nto compare our model to baseline and state-of-the-art models\nwhich require tertiary structure and/or multiple sequence\nalignments (MSAs) to identify protein interacting residues\n12,14.\nDespite not using structure as input, our model achieved\ncompetitive performance compared to structure-based bench-\nmarks, and decreased performance compared to ScanNet\n(Fig. 1d). Speciﬁcally, on the “Test none” split which reﬂects\nmost distant proteins, SaLT&PepPr exhibited superior perfor-\nmance to baseline methods based on structural homology and\nhandcrafted feature selection, suggesting strong generalization to\nnon-homologous proteins from different families (Fig. 1d).\nFinally, we visualized SaLT&PepPr predictions on partner\nproteins with available crystal structures from the PDB, high-\nlighting the model’s capability to identify concise interacting\ninterfaces, both in isolated structures of single binding proteins\n(Fig. 1e) and within co-crystals (Fig.1f).\nPeptide prioritization using predicted interfaces on binding\npartners. Previously, we demonstrated the utility of using inter-\nacting partners to derive functional peptides for uAb generation\nby executing the Rosetta-based PeptiDerive protocol on existing\nco-crystals containing the target protein, identifying the linear\npolypeptide segments suggested to contribute most to binding\nenergy2. However, this method relies on experimentally-derived\nco-crystals, which only capture a small percentage of the\n~650,000 known human protein-protein interactions (PPIs)15.T o\nameliorate this shortcoming, we integrated our model with\navailable PPI datasets to identify linear peptide guides for a given\ntarget protein by predicting the binding sites on partners that\ninteract with the target of interest (Fig.1a)6– 8. As a result, pep-\ntides can be sampled across the partner sequence to both max-\nimize breadth of selection or incorporate prior knowledge of\nknown target-selective binding domains. Speci ﬁcally, as our\nmodel predicts the probability of each amino acid in the partner\nprotein sequence being an interaction site, continuous peptides\nwere “cut” from the full partner sequence via a local-maximum\nsampling approach to isolate peptides of a user-speciﬁed length\nwith highest predicted probability of binding that also represent\nlocal maxima in the predicted binding likelihood (Fig.1g). In\ntotal, the inference time for a single target protein in SaLT&PepPr\ntook about one minute on a standard machine with 2 CPU cores,\n8 GB of RAM, and no GPU, far more efﬁcient than methods\nrequiring structure prediction (Supplementary Fig. 2)16,17.\nCharacterization of interface-derived uAbs for targeted β-\ncatenin degradation. Recently, based on the seminal work of\nPortnoff et al.1, our group reprogrammed the speciﬁcity of a\nmodular human E3 ubiquitin ligase called CHIP (carboxyl-ter-\nminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) by replacing its natural\nsubstrate-binding domain, TPR, with designer“guide” peptides to\ngenerate minimal and programmable uAb architectures2,18,19.T o\ndemonstrate that guide peptides derived from known, selected\ninteracting partners can function as robust guide peptides, weﬁrst\nfocused on designing uAbs to β-catenin, as aberrant Wnt/β-\ncatenin signaling is widely implicated in numerous cancers,\nincluding colorectal, hepatocellular, lung, and pancreatic 10,20.\nARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05464-z\n2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY|          (2023) 6:1081 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05464-z | www.nature.com/commsbio\nSpeciﬁcally, mutated β-catenin accumulates in the cytosol of\naffected cells, while wild-typeβ-catenin binds to the transmem-\nbrane protein, E-cadherin 20.

PPBS dataset, test splits, as well as model\ntest scores are obtained from Tubiana et al.12 The PPBS dataset splits represent: 70% (at least 70% sequence homology with one training example),\nhomology (at most 70% homology with a train set example, although at least one train set belongs to the same protein superfamily), topology (at least one\ntrain set has a similar protein topology with none in the similar protein family) and None (none of the above groups). The structural homology baseline\nuses template protein chains with known binding sites, a local pairwise structural comparison, and an alignment weighting scheme. The handcrafted\nfeatures baseline includes 58 features based on the structural, atomic, and sequence information, with an XGBoost algorithm. Note that MaSIF-site was not\nretrained for the per-residue task.e Comparison between the predicted SaLT&PepPr scores and experimentally-annotated PPBS binding sites on different\nprotein structures in the PPBS dataset.

Immunoblots of the cytosolic\nfractions revealed that all but one uAb promoted statistically\nsigniﬁcant β-catenin degradation relative to non-transfected\nDLD1 control cells, with several (SnP_3, SnP_5, SnP_8)\ndegrading >60% of the cytosolicβ-catenin pool (Fig.2a). Using\nTOPFlash22, a luciferase reporter that serves as a reliable readout\nof β-catenin– dependent transcriptional activity, we observed that\nthe strong SnP_8 degrader dramatically decreased the transcrip-\ntional response toβ-catenin relative to empty vector control cells\n(Fig. 2b). For comparison, the SnP_7 degrader induced a more\nmodest inhibitory effect onβ-catenin signaling, in line with its\nintermediate degradation activity.\nWe con ﬁrmed that peptide-guided uAbs promoted target\ndegradation through speciﬁc, peptide-mediated binding of β-\ncatenin as demonstrated by quantitative ELISA (Fig. 2c).\nSpeciﬁcally, puriﬁed versions of SnP_7 and SnP_8 uAbs exhibited\nstrong afﬁnity to immobilizedβ-catenin with virtually no binding\nto the immobilized bovine serum albumin (BSA) control. The\nstrong β-catenin binding exhibited by SnP_7 and SnP_8 was\nattributable to the SaLT&PepPr peptides as evidenced by the lack\nof binding for the CHIPΔTPR ubiquitination domain alone. We\nnote that the relatively high binding activity of these uAbs forβ-\ncatenin was in line with the binding afﬁnity measured for other\nuAbs1,23. Given the similar binding activity yet different levels of\nβ-catenin silencing, other factors such as proximity/orientation\nupon binding must also contribute to the efﬁcacy of peptide-\nguided uAbs.\nFinally, to test the off-targeting propensity of our peptide-\nguided uAbs, one dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem\nmass spectrometry (1D-LC-MS/MS) analysis was performed on\ntotal proteins harvested from cells overexpressingβ-catenin, with\nor without treatment with the uAb candidates, with ~6700\nproteins were quantiﬁed. Our analysis demonstrated the expected\nincrease in uAb-associated proteins, including tryptic peptides\nassigned to the human CHIP protein (STUB1), and a corre-\nsponding decrease in β-catenin abundance between the control\nand treated samples for both tested uAbs (Fig. 2d and\nSupplementary Fig. 3). In contrast, there were no signi ﬁcant\nchanges in the abundance of other proteins as a function of uAb\nexpression, conﬁrming that there were no statistically signiﬁcant\noff-target effects associated with uAb expression or degradation.\nFig. 2 Characterization of peptide-guided uAbs for targetedβ-catenin degradation. aDegradation of endogenousβ-catenin in cytosolic fraction of\nDLD1 cells analyzed via immunoblotting with anti-β-catenin and anti-β-tubulin antibodies.

Having established the\nability to use interacting partners as effective scaffolds for guide\npeptide generation, we sought to test SaLT&PepPr’s ability to\nprioritize effective guide peptides in a data-driven manner. To do\nthis, weﬁrst chose eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein\n2 (4E-BP2), a relatively small and disordered protein involved in\neukaryotic translation initiation that has also been implicated in\ncancer24,25. 4E-BP2 has a single known speci ﬁc interactor:\neukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)26. Using the eIF4E as input\ninto SaLT&PepPr, we derived the top six high-scoring peptides\nfrom its sequence (Supplementary Table 1). These peptides were\ncloned into our uAb plasmids, and transfected into A673 Ewing\nsarcoma cells, where 4E-BP2 is highly expressed. Following\nWestern blotting post treatment, we successfully identiﬁed two\ndegraders, 4E-BP2_SnP_3 and 4E-BP2_SnP_6, demonstrating\nover 50% degradation of endogenous 4E-BP2 as compared to that\nof a non-targeting control plasmid (Fig.3a-b), highlighting the\nutility of our algorithm.\nWe next turned our focus to TRIM8, an E3 ubiquitin ligase\nitself that regulates the levels of the core fusion oncoprotein\ndriving Ewing sarcoma, EWS-FLI111. Loss of TRIM8 induces\nEWS-FLI1-mediated overdose in Ewing sarcoma cells, leading to\nupregulation of apoptosis\n11. Using TRIM8 as an input into our\ncurated PPI database to identify multiple interacting partners\n(Fig. 1a), we used SaLT&PepPr to derive the top six highest-\nscoring peptides from various partners and integrated them into\nour uAb architecture (Supplementary Table 1). Next, we\ntransfected these uAbs into A673 Ewing sarcoma cells, and\nsuccessfully identi ﬁed two candidates, TRIM8_SnP_5 and\nTRIM8_SnP_6, that degraded endogenous TRIM8 with statistical\nsigniﬁcance (Fig. 3c, d). We then co-transfected these six uAbs\nalongside a GFP-basedﬂuorogenic caspase reporter of apoptosis\nin A673 cells, termed ZipGFP27, and observed that our most\nFig. 3 Characterization of SaLT&PepPr-derived uAbs for endogenous target degradation. aDegradation of endogenous 4E-BP2 in protein extracts of\nA673 cells analyzed via immunoblotting with anti-4E-BP2 and anti-Vinculin antibodies.

Fusing these partner protein-derived guide peptides to E3\nubiquitin ligase conjugation domains yields a simple, genetically-\nencoded uAb architecture for downstream TPD. While we\ndemonstrate success onβ-catenin, 4E-BP2, and TRIM8 by using\nknown interacting partner information, the af ﬁnity and off-\ntargeting propensity of a partner protein-derived guide peptide\nare expected to vary based on the speciﬁc downselected peptide as\nwell as properties of the partner protein, and future work to apply\npartner-derived guides to a greater number of targets will increase\nconﬁdence in our approach.\nOur work further demonstrates the application of pLMs to\nidentify protein– protein binding interfaces, which while less\neffective on structured targets than current state-of-the-art\napproaches, are competitive with structural homology or\nfeature-based methods. We envision that future models, which\ncombine larger language models with evolutionary and structural\ninformation and directly consider both interacting proteins, may\nfurther improve performance both computationally and experi-\nmentally. In total, by integrating pLM-based binding predictions\nwith uAbs for protein degradation, our work motivates the uti-\nlization of protein interactions to design programmable tools for\nbroad-scale proteome editing applications.\nMethods\nDataset generation. The PDB-derived dataset for this paper was\ngenerated by mining the RCSB PDB for veriﬁed, high-resolution\nPPI structures. Every interaction of every assembly of every co-\ncrystal in the PDB was retrieved, and then the interactions were\nﬁltered for uniqueness (a unique interaction was one with a\nunique pair of partners, or with signiﬁcantly different (>100Å2)\nburied surface area for the same pair of partners). Filtration\nyielded 420,000 PPIs. Next, all interaction structures with amino\nacid sequence length greater than 50 and less than 1023 (for\ncomputational training speed) were processed with Rosetta\nPeptiDerive13, extracting a list of derived peptides and their\nassociated Rosetta energy scores (REUs), with lower scores\nindicating higher predicted stability. Afterﬁltering entries with\nlower than -1000 REU, the REU scores for 10-mer peptides at\neach position were averaged to estimate a per amino acid position\nenergy score. The per position energy score was averaged between\nmatching derived protein sequences, so that the dataset does not\ninclude redundant entries. The energy score was thresholded at -1\nand converted to a binary classiﬁcation task with less than -1\nenergy being a protein binding amino acid and energy greater\nthan -1 being a non-binding amino acid. Protein sequences were\nthen clustered using MMseqs connected component clustering at\n0.25 minimum sequence identity to group homologous proteins.\nTraining, validation and testing sets were created with 26,423\ntrain, 3487 validation, and 3817 test sequences, with no entries\nacross different sets belonging to the same cluster. Thus, valida-\ntion and test metrics do not reﬂect memorization of the prop-\nerties of homologous protein sequences. Proteins which were\nclustered by MMseqs to partner proteins selected for in vitro\ntesting were also moved to the test set. For benchmarking, the\nDockground-based PPBS dataset used in ScanNet was\nutilized12,28. The dataset was processed into a sequence-to-binary\ntarget list format for the model.\nInteractome curation and calculations . The percentage of\nthe human proteome with at least one binding partner was\nestimated by screening three databases: IMEx ( https://www.\nimexconsortium.org/), BioGRID ( https://thebiogrid.org/), or\nPROPER (https://genemo.ucsd.edu/proper/)6– 8. Only databases\nthat explicitly provide experimental evidence of physical binding\nwere considered. This criterion excluded StringDB, which does\nnot guarantee physical interaction. The gene symbols corre-\nsponding to each human protein were downloaded from UniProt\n(20601 total). For each database, pandas was used to scan for\nsymbols and compile lists of proteins involved in at least one PPI.\nScreening was performed separately for heterogeneous interac-\ntions and homogeneous (self-binding) interactions. To account\nfor varying curation standards, the entire process was repeated\ntwice with different sets of ﬁlters. The most stringent or least\ninclusive ﬁltering included PROPER entries with p < 0.01, all\nIMEx entries, and BioGRID entries justiﬁed by low throughput\n(LTP) physical evidence. The least stringent or most inclusive\nﬁltering included PROPER entries withp < 0.05, all IMEx entries,\nand BioGRID entries justiﬁed by either LTP or high throughput\n(HTP) physical evidence. Results are provided for both cases.\nTo quantify the availability of structural data on PPIs, the PDB\nwas scanned for co-crystal complexes of two human proteins.\nComplexes were divided into two categories: heteromeric and\nhomomeric. The PDB provides an Entry ID for each co-crystal and\nFASTA sequences for its two constituent proteins. Because species\nindications and constituent Entry IDs were not directly available,\ndetermining the co-crystal composition required a multistep\nprocess: (i) mapping co-crystal Entry IDs to organisms and\nﬁltering for human-human interactions only (reference: source.idx\nfrom the PDB archive, https://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/derived_\ndata/index/) (ii) mapping the constituent proteins in each co-\ncrystal to Entry IDs based on their FASTA sequences (reference:\npdb_seqres.txt from the PDB archive,https://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/\npdb/derived_data/) (iii) mapping Entry IDs to UniProt KB\nidentiﬁers and UniProt gene symbols (references : SIFTS database\npdb_chain_uniprot.csv, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts/\nquick.html, UniProt Retrieve/ID Mapping tool) (iv) comparing\nthe list of PDB-derived UniProt gene symbols to the full human\ngenome. The ﬁnal result represents the total number of human\nproteins involved in at least one co-crystal in PDB.\nModel training. The model is based upon Meta AI’s ESM-2\nmodel (https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm) with a neural\nnetwork head trained to classify the per amino acid interacting\npositions9. Theﬁnal three layers of ESM-2 650 M wereﬁne tuned\ntogether with a four layer fully connected neural network classi-\nﬁcation head which processes each position output of ESM-2 to\npredict a per position probability. Each protein is passed to the\nmodel with the per amino acid binary class as the target for cross\nentropy loss:−(ylog(p) + (1 − y)log(1 − p)) wherey is the binary\nclass label (0= nonbinding and 1= binding) and p is the pre-\ndicted probability of the amino acid belonging to a binding site.\nThe model was implemented using PyTorch and trained until\nvalidation loss began to increase. When using the PPBS dataset,\nthe weighting method used in Tubiana, et al., was adopted by\nmultiplying the loss by the speciﬁed weight for for consistency\nwith ScanNet12.\nModel evaluation. The model was evaluated and tested on held\nout binding partner proteins. Metrics are chosen to reﬂect the\ncomputational task (AUROC, Spearman correlation) and the\ndownstream laboratory task (topn amino acid energy scores, % of\ntop predicted amino acids meeting a minimum binding energy\nthreshold).\nARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05464-z\n6 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY|          (2023) 6:1081 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05464-z | www.nature.com/commsbio\nPPBS benchmarking. PPBS dataset, test splits, as well as model\ntest scores were obtained directly from Tubiana, et al.12 The PPBS\ndataset splits represent: 70% (at least 70% sequence homology\nwith one training example), homology (at most 70% homology\nwith a train set example, although at least one train set belongs to\nthe same protein superfamily), topology (at least one train set has\na similar protein topology with none in the similar protein\nfamily) and None (none of the above groups). The structural\nhomology baseline uses template protein chains with known\nbinding sites, a local pairwise structural comparison, and an\nalignment weighting scheme. The handcrafted features baseline\nincludes 58 features based on the structural, atomic, and sequence\ninformation, with an XGBoost algorithm. Note that MaSIF-site\nwas not retrained for the per-residue task. Additional details and\nimplementation of baseline models and test data splits can be\nfound in Tubiana, et al.\n12 Comparisons between the predicted\nSaLT&PepPr scores and experimentally-annotated PPBS binding\nsites on different protein structures in the PPBS dataset were\nvisualized in PyMol, with a red-to-blue color scheme. Red indi-\ncates high binding probability amino acids, with blue as low\nbinding probability, normalized for each protein chain.\nGeneration of plasmids. All uAb plasmids were generated from\nthe standard pcDNA3 vector, harboring a cytomegalovirus\n(CMV) promoter and a C-terminal IRES-mCherry cassette.\nTarget coding sequences (CDS) were synthesized as gBlocks from\nIntegrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Sequences were ampliﬁed\nwith overhangs for Gibson Assembly-mediated insertion into the\npcDNA3-SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD-sfGFP backbone (Addgene\n#141184) linearized by digestion with NheI and BamHI. An Esp3I\nrestriction site was introduced immediately upstream of the\nCHIPΔTPR CDS andﬂexible GSGSG linker via the KLD Enzyme\nMix (NEB) following PCR ampliﬁcation with mutagenic primers\n(Genewiz). For uAb assembly, oligos for candidate peptides were\nannealed and ligated via T4 DNA Ligase into the Esp3I-digested\nuAb backbone. Assembled constructs were transformed into\n50 µL NEB Turbo CompetentEscherichia coli cells, and plated\nonto LB agar supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic for\nsubsequent sequence veriﬁcation of colonies and plasmid pur-\niﬁcation (Genewiz). For protein puriﬁcation, genes encoding each\nof the uAb constructs were PCR ampliﬁed from pcDNA3-based\nplasmids using primers that introduced HindIII and XhoI over-\nhangs. The resulting PCR amplicons were ligated in an empty\npET28a vector, which had been doubly digested with HindIII/\nXhoI. This process yielded plasmids which encoded each of the\nselected peptides followed by CHIPΔTPR, now bearing a 6xHis\ntag at its C-terminus. All plasmids were conﬁrmed by DNA\nsequencing by Genewiz or at the Biotechnology Resource Center\n(BRC) Genomics Facility of the Cornell Institute of Biotechnol-\nogy, and subjected to plasmid puriﬁcation.\nCell culture. The DLD1 cell line was a generous gift from Dr.\nPengbo Zhou. DLD1 cells (ATCC CCL-221), HEK293T cells\n(ATCC CRL-3216), and A673 cells (ATCC CRL-1598) were\ncultured in DMEM supplemented with 100 units/mL penicillin,\n100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10% FBS. Unless otherwise noted,\nthe day before the transfection, 0.3 × 10\n6 cells were seeded in each\nwell of a 6-well plate. uAb-expressing plasmids were prepared\nusing the PureYield miniprep kit to remove endotoxins. On the\nday of transfection, plasmids were transfected by Lipofectamine\n3000. After 3 days of incubation post-transfection, cell lysates\nwere collected for immunoblotting.\nCell fractionation and immunoblotting. For probingβ-catenin\nin Fig.2, on the day of harvest, cells were detached by addition of\n0.05% trypsin-EDTA and cell pellets were washed twice with ice-\ncold 1× PBS. Cells were then lysed and subcellular fractions were\nisolated from lysates using a Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit\n(ThermoFisher) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Speciﬁcally,\nice-cold cytosolic extraction buffer was added to the cell pellet,\nthe mixture was placed at 4 °C for 10 min with gentle shaking\nfollowed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The\nsupernatant was collected immediately to a pre-chilled PCR tube\nand placed on ice followed by immunoblotting or stored at\n−20 °C for future usage. The pellet was then added with ice-cold\nmembrane extraction buffer. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for\n10 min followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. The\nsupernatant was immediately transferred to a pre-chilled tube.\nProtein concentration was quantiﬁed using the Pierce BCA Protein\nAssay Kit (ThermoFisher). An equivalent amount of total protein\nwas loaded into Precise Tris-HEPES 4−20% sodium dodecyl sul-\nfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels (ThermoFisher) and separated by\nelectrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed according to\nstandard protocols. Brieﬂy, proteins were transferred to poly(-\nvinylidene ﬂuoride) (PVDF) membranes (Millipore), blocked with\n5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Carnation) in 1× tris-buffered saline\n(TBS) with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for\n1 h, washed three times with TBST for 10 min, and probed with\nrabbit anti-β-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling, Cat # 8480 S; diluted\n1:1000) or rabbit anti-β-Tubulin (Cell Signaling Cat # 2146; diluted\n1:1000). The blots were washed again three times with TBST for\n5 min each and then probed with a secondary antibody, donkey\nanti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Abcam, Cat # 7083;\ndiluted 1:2500), for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were detected by\nchemiluminescence using a ChemiDoc MP imager (Bio-Rad).\nDensitometry analysis of protein bands in immunoblots was per-\nformed using ImageJ software as described here:https://imagej.nih.\ngov/ij/docs/examples/dot-blot/.B r i eﬂy, bands in each lane were\ngrouped as a row or a horizontal “lane” and quantiﬁed using\nImageJ’s gel analysis function. Intensity data for the uAb bands was\nnormalized to band intensity for empty plasmid control cases from\nsix independent experiments.\nFor probing TRIM8 and 4E-BP2 in Fig. 3, on the day of\nharvest, cells were detached by addition of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA\nand cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS. Cells\nwere then lysed and subcellular fractions were isolated from\nlysates using a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor cocktail\n(Millipore Sigma) in Pierce RIPA buffer (ThermoFisher).\nSpeciﬁcally, the protease inhibitor cocktail-RIPA buffer solution\nwas added to the cell pellet, the mixture was placed at 4 °C for\n30 min followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at\n4 °C. The supernatant was collected immediately to a pre-chilled\nPCR tube, and after adding 4× Bolt ™ LDS Sample Buffer\n(ThermoFisher) with 5% β-mercaptoethanol in a 3:1 ratio, the\nmixture was incubated at 95 °C for 10 min prior to immunoblot-\nting. Immunoblotting was performed according to standard\nprotocols. Brieﬂy, samples were loaded at equal volumes into\nBolt™ Bis-Tris Plus Mini Protein Gels (ThermoFisher) and\nseparated by electrophoresis. iBlot™ 2 Transfer Stacks (Invitrogen)\nwere used for membrane blot transfer, and following a 1 h room-\ntemperature incubation in SuperBlock™ Blocking Buffer (Ther-\nmoFisher), proteins were probed with rabbit anti-TRIM8 anti-\nbody (Cell Signaling, Cat # 4936, diluted 1:500), rabbit anti-4E-\nBP2 antibody (Cell Signaling, Cat # 2845 T, diluted 1:500), rabbit\nanti-Vinculin antibody (ThermoFisher, Cat # 700062, diluted\n1:500), or mouse anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat #\nsc-47724; diluted 1:500) for overnight incubation at 4 °C. The\nblots were washed three times with 1× TBST for 5 min each and\nthen probed with a secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG\n(H + L), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (ThermoFisher, Cat #\n31460, diluted 1:5000) or goat anti-mouse IgG (H+ L) Poly-HRP\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05464-z ARTICLE\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY|          (2023) 6:1081 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05464-z | www.nature.com/commsbio 7\n(ThermoFisher, Cat # 32230, diluted 1:2000) for 1– 2 h at room\ntemperature. Following three washes with 1× TBST for 5 min\neach, blots were detected by chemiluminescence using an iBright\n1500 Imaging System (ThermoFisher). Densitometry analysis of\nprotein bands in immunoblots was performed using FIJI software\nas described here: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/examples/dot-\nblot/. Brieﬂy, bands in each lane were grouped as a row or a\nhorizontal “lane” and quantiﬁed using FIJI’s gel analysis function.\nIntensity data for the uAb bands wasﬁrst normalized to band\nintensity of GAPDH (for TRIM8) or vinculin (for 4E-BP2) in\neach lane then to the average band intensity for empty uAb vector\ncontrol cases across replicates.\nTOPFlash assay. A total of 1 × 10\n4 DLD1 cells were seeded on a\nwhite-bottom 96-well plate 20– 24 h prior to transfection. On the\nday of transfection, each well received the following plasmids:\nM50 Super 8× TOPFlash plasmid (Addgene plasmid # 12456) or\nM51 Super 8× FOPFlash (TOPFlash mutant; Addgene plasmid #\n12457), pCMV-Renilla 29, and pcDNA3-SnP_7 or pcDNA3-\nSnP_8. A total of 100 ng of plasmid DNA in a ratio of TOP-\nFlash/FOPFlash : Renilla : SnP_7/SnP_8 uAb= 1:0.1:3 was mixed\nwith Lipofectamine 3000 reagent in serum free Opti-MEM\nmedium and added dropwise to each well after incubation at\nroom temperature for 15 min. After 48 h of incubation, cells were\nlysed and the ﬁreﬂy and Renilla luminescence signals were\nmeasured sequentially by the dual-luciferase reporter kit (Pro-\nmega). Plates were read on a microplate reader (Tecan). The\nluciferase activities were measured and normalized against the\ncontrol Renilla activities.\nProtein expression and puriﬁcation. All puriﬁed uAb constructs,\nand unfused CHIPΔTPR were obtained from cultures ofE. coli\nBL21(DE3) cells carrying pET28a-based plasmids encoding the\nSnP_7 the SnP_8 uAbs or CHIPΔTPR\n3. Cells were grown in\nLuria-Bertani (LB) medium according to protocols described\npreviously3. Brieﬂy, protein expression was induced with 1 M\nisopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when the culture\ndensity, determined by optical density at 600 nm (OD 600),\nreached 0.5– 0.7 and proceeded for 12– 16 h at 37 °C. Following\nexpression, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for\n10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 10 mL\nof phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed using an\nEmulsiFlex-C5 high-pressure homogenizer (Avestin). Lysates\nwere cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 10,000 × g\nfor 10 min at 4 °C. Clariﬁed lysates containing 6xHis-tagged\nproteins were subjected to gravity-ﬂow Ni2+-afﬁnity puriﬁcation\nusing HisPur Ni-NTA resin (ThermoFisher) following the man-\nufacturer’s protocols. Puriﬁed proteins were stored at 4 °C for up\nto 2 weeks. The ﬁnal purity of all proteins was conﬁrmed by\nCoomassie-blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels.\nELISA. ELISA was performed according to previously published\nprotocols3. Brieﬂy, 96-well plates (MaxiSorp; Nunc Nalgene) were\nincubated with 1μg/mL ofβ-catenin (Biomatik, Cat # RPU40704)\ndiluted in PBS, pH 7.4, 50 µL/well, at 4 °C overnight. Plates were\nincubated with 200 µL blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk\n(Carnation) in PBS) overnight at 4 °C, then washed three times\nwith 200 µL PBS-T (PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) per well. Puriﬁed\nuAb constructs were biotinylated with EZ-Link ™ NHS-Biotin\n(ThermoFisher, Cat # 20217) following the manufacturer ’s\ninstructions. The biotinylated uAb constructs were appropriately\nserially diluted in triplicate in PBS and added to the ELISA plates\nfor 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS-T, then\nincubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of HRP-\nconjugated streptavidin (ThermoFisher, Cat # N100; diluted\n1:20,000), with shaking at 450 rpm. After another three PBS-T\nwashes, 100 µL of 3,3’-5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (1-Step\nUltra TMB-ELISA; ThermoFisher) was added to each well, and\nthe plates were incubated at room temperature in the dark. The\nreaction was stopped by adding 100 µL of 2 M H2SO4, and\nabsorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a\nFilterMax F5 microplate spectrophotometer (Agilent).\nProteomics. HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM supple-\nmented with 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin,\nand 10% FBS. Target-sfGFP (1 µg) and Target-sfGFP (1 µg)+\npcDNA-uAb (1 µg) plasmids were transfected into cells as tri-\nplicates (8 × 10\n4/well in a 6-well plate) with Lipofectamine 3000\n(Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Gibco). Three days post transfection,\ncells were harvested and washed four times with 500 µL 1X cold\nPBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in 200 µL Pierce RIPA\nbuffer (VWR) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The homogenates\nwere treated with 20% (w/v) SDS in triethylammonium bicar-\nbonate buffer, pH 8.5, followed by probe sonication and heating\nat 80 °C for 5 min. The supernatants were collected after cen-\ntrifugation and the concentrations were determined using\ndetergent-compatible Bradford assay. From each sample, 20 µg\nwas reduced and alkylated, and digested with trypsin using an\nS-trap micro device. Peptide eluents were lyophilized, and after\nreconstitution, equal volumes of each sample were mixed to make\nan SPQC pool. Approximately 1 µg of each sample, and three\nreplicates of the SPQC pool were analyzed by 1D-LCMS/MS.\nSamples were analyzed using a M-Class UPLC system (Waters)\ncoupled to an Exploris 480 high resolution accurate tandem mass\nspectrometer (ThermoFisher) via a Nanospray Flex Ion source\nand processed using Spectronaut 16. Thep values were calculated\nby performing a Student’s t-test on log2fc values. The log2fc\nvalues were calculated by the difference of average abundances of\nthe proteins in the presence and absence of uAb.\nFunctional assays. For the apoptosis assay, 3 × 105 A673 cells/well\nwere seeded on a 24-well plate 20– 24 h prior to transfection. On the\nday of transfection, each well received the following plasmids:\nZipGFP-Casp3 plasmid (Addgene plasmid #81241) and pcDNA3-\nSnP_TRIM8_#. A total of 500 ng of plasmid DNA in a ratio of\nZipGFP-Casp3:pcDNA3-SnP_TRIM8_#=1:1 was mixed with\nLipofectamine 2000 reagent in serum-free Opti-MEM medium and\nadded dropwise to each well after incubation at room temperature\nfor 20 min. After 60 h of incubation, cells were harvested and\nanalyzed similarly as mentioned for uAb screening. Cells expres-\nsing mCherry were gated, and normalized EGFP cellﬂuorescence\nwas calculated as compared to a sample transfected with a non-\ntargeting uAb, using the FlowJo software (https://ﬂowjo.com/). An\nexample gating strategy is found in Supplementary Fig. 4.\nStatistics and reproducibility. To ensure robust reproducibility\nof all results, experiments were performed with at least three\nbiological replicates and at least three technical measurements.\nSample sizes were not predetermined based on statistical methods\nbut were chosen according to the standards of theﬁeld (at least\nthree independent biological replicates for each condition), which\ngave sufﬁcient statistics for the effect sizes of interest. All data\nwere reported as average values with error bars representing\nstandard deviation (SD). For individual samples, unless described\notherwise, statistical signiﬁcance was determined by paired Stu-\ndent’s t tests (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.01;***p < 0.001;****p < 0.0001).\nAll graphs were generated using Prism 9 for MacOS version 9.2.0.\nNo data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were\nnot randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation\nduring experiments and outcome assessment.\nARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05464-z\n8 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY|          (2023) 6:1081 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05464-z | www.nature.com/commsbio\nReporting summary.
