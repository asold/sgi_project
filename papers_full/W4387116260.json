Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics           (2023) 10:99 \nIn an era of electronical medical records, rapidly expand -\ning publication rates of medical knowledge, and large-\nscale registries, orthopaedics is in a dire need of inno -\nvative approaches to facilitate the adoption of the latest \nknowledge in clinical practice. While machine learning \n(ML) has been heralded as one solution to many research \ntasks hampered by previous technological limitations \n[12], there is an increasing need to direct our attention \ntowards subdomains of ML that are convenient for the \nextraction of meaningful clinical information stored in \nmedical records. We believe natural language processing \n(NLP) to be one such domain of ML, with an immense \nfuture potential to catalyse rate-limiting steps in ortho -\npaedic research.\nFundamental concepts\nNatural language processing is a ML-based tool that \ninvolves quantitative encoding of information derived \nfrom human language. Data generated from speech- and \ntext-processing NLP algorithms can be used to solve a \nvariety of tasks with broad applications in medical prac -\ntice and research. Due to limited examples of NLP-based \nresearch in orthopaedics [3, 15], commonly used NLP \ntasks are best illustrated with examples of their potential \napplications across medical fields:\n• Text classification – Categorisation and clustering of \nscientific articles based on level of evidence and/or \nsub-topics, detected using abstract screening for rel -\nevant terms.\n• Information extraction – Identification of informa -\ntion related to patients, interventions, comparisons, \nand outcome variables (PICO elements) [2] from \nelectronic medical records (EMR) and publications \nusing, for example, named entity recognition (NER).\n• Question answering – Automated responses to fre -\nquently asked questions with a custom medical \nknowledge base used to generate conversational lay -\ners.\n• Sentiment analysis – Assessment of the emotions \nand opinions of patients about a medical service \nbased on analysis of the affective qualities of written \nreviews [4].\n• Summarization – Abstraction of a large volume of \nmedical evidence to generate a short summary with \nessential and easy to understand information for \npatients.\nUnderstanding of the inner workings and performance \nof ML models are key steps in identifying applications for \nNLP in orthopaedic research [10]. Accuracy (closeness), \nprecision (exactness), recall (positive predictive value) \nand the F 1 score (a combination of precision and recall) \nare key metrics used in the evaluation and interpretation \nof NLP models.\nBarriers to automated data extraction\nWhile there is no shortage of available data for orthopae -\ndic research, a major barrier to the accessibility of data \nis due to its storage as unstructured text. A previously \npublished editorial outlined the discrepancy between \nthe publication rate of primary research articles and the \nsynthesis of up-to-date evidence in the form of system -\natic reviews and meta-analyses [18]. Consequently, the \nconcept of living evidence synthesis was proposed to \ntackle this problem, which largely relies on NLP for near \nreal-time extraction and compilation of relevant medical \ndata. Additionally, the widespread adoption of EMRs by \nhealthcare systems across the globe provides a wealth of \nuntapped medical knowledge in the form of deidentified \npatient data. Unfortunately, the lack of standardization \nand consistency in medical documentation poses difficul-\nties for the automated extraction of relevant and accurate \ninformation. Early results show improved performance \nin clinical predictions when structured EMR data is \ncomplemented with NLP analysis of unstructured EMR \ntext [ 13]. While both supervised [9] and unsupervised \n[1] ML approaches are available for NLP , information \nextraction from medical text are likely to benefit from \ncontext-specific interpretation. Problematically, medical \ntext is heterogeneous in structure and style, with a vast \npossibility of syntactic and semantic variability (such as \nabbreviations), which in turn leads to ambiguous inter -\npretation by both humans and computers [7]. The design \nof automated frameworks for reliable entity and pattern-\nrecognition in such complex environments is a critical \nchallenge to overcome. Supervised ML methods using \nlabelling instructions agreed upon by domain experts \nmay reduce annotation errors, and lead to a higher qual -\nity of information extraction from context-specific text \ndata [11]. For example, a panel of experts in ACL surgery \nwould have the possibility to develop labelling instruc -\ntions and benchmarks for extracting data from medical \nrecords regarding postoperative outcomes after ACL \nreconstruction. The panel would need to reach a consen -\nsus on the essential components to label, such as graft \ntunnel placement, graft choice and thickness, presence \nor absence of anterolateral augmentation, among oth -\ners. Labelling instructions would thereby help establish \nbenchmarks for consistency and reproducibility in NLP-\ndriven research, and maximize the quality of evidence \nsynthesis across the international orthopaedic commu -\nnity. It is important to point out that the clinical utility \nof AI systems depends heavily on the magnitude and \nquality of training data, which leads to concern regard -\ning the ethical and secure access to patient information. \nPage 3 of 5\nZsidai et al. Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics           (2023) 10:99 \n \nConsequently, future efforts will also require carefully \nplanned regulatory supervision to safeguard the national \nand international distribution of patient data extracted \nfrom medical records with NLP [5].\nCondition‑specific annotation and NLP frameworks\nThe use of standardized knowledge bases is essential \nfor the design and implementation of NLP algorithms \ndesigned for specific research purposes. We believe the \nnext step towards solving the challenges associated with \ninformation extraction is to establish comprehensive \nknowledge-base of annotated disease- or injury-specific \nmedical text. This idea rests on the principle that an \nNLP model is more likely to perform well when trained \non a body of domain-specific information, with expert-\nlevel annotation and abstraction of the key element in \nthe text, even if it has been pre-trained for general lan -\nguage understanding. A recent study of biomedical image \nanalysis determined that improvements in labelling \ninstructions have an immense impact on the interrater \nvariability in the quality and consistency of annotations, \nand consequently, on the performance of the final algo -\nrithm [11]. Similarly, clearly formulated instructions \nestablished by domain experts may mitigate some of the \nerrors pervasive to labelling due to time pressure, vari -\nability in motivation, differences in knowledge or style, \nand interpretation of the text [7]. Importantly, expert \nannotation of training data for a given area of orthopae -\ndics should focus on creating a consistent and replicable \nframework for NLP application, which clearly distin -\nguishes entities, relationships between different entities, \nand multiple attributes specific to individual entities [17]. \nThis approach could then be considered a standard oper -\nating procedure for reliable and accurate extraction of \nessential medical information from medical charts and \nprimary research articles (Fig.  1). Consequently, we pro -\npose the creation of annotated collections of scientific \ntext based on expert consensus, specific to musculoskel -\netal conditions affecting the spine, shoulder, hip, knee, \nand ankle joints, to expedite data extraction and the syn -\nthesis of up-to-date evidence using NLP tools. Due to the \ninherent complexity of the task, the annotation of medi -\ncal knowledge will require the interdisciplinary coopera -\ntion of healthcare professionals, linguists, and computer \nscientists.\nThe potential of large language models\nOver the recent year, large language models (LLMs), \nsuch as GPT-4 [8], Med-PaLM 2 [14], among others, \nshowcased the revolutionary impact of medical ques -\ntion-answering with generative AI (GAI) on the health -\ncare sector. Expert-annotated, foundational datasets \ndesigned for NLP tasks may be integrated with LLMs \nto perform a variety of tasks, expediting both orthopae -\ndic research, the appraisal of existing evidence and the \ndelivery of orthopaedic care in the clinic. Annotation of \nimportant clinical concepts and their relations in EHRs, \noperative notes, radiology notes, and research studies \nbased on semantic similarity may be used to train LLMs \nfor performing clinically useful tasks with high efficiency \nand accuracy [16]. Additionally, GAI may be applied in \na broader sense, with the capability to interpret multi -\nmodal, domain-specific information, including labelled \nor unlabelled medical images, patient interviews and \npatient reported outcome data in the context of complex \nclinical scenarios [6]. Harnessing the potential of LLMs \nand GAI may catalyse the development of clinical deci -\nsion-support tools to optimize the quality of treatment \nFig. 1 Key steps in the collaborative collection, annotation, and extraction of medical data for living evidence synthesis and integration with LLMs\nPage 4 of 5Zsidai et al. Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics           (2023) 10:99 \nfor patients with orthopaedic conditions. Such endeav -\nours require strict emphasis on the quality of data used \nfor training foundational datasets, which necessitates \nexpert consensus to lay out standards for the information \nused to design systems with advanced medical reasoning \ncapabilities.\nConclusion\nWe believe the adoption of NLP frameworks to be one \nof the key steps in the evolution of medical data extrac -\ntion and evidence-synthesis. There is currently a need for \ninnovative solutions to obtain meaningful information \nfrom the growing availability of structured and unstruc -\ntured medical text, with the goal to improve the quality \nof patient care. Considering the immense potential in the \nclinical and research setting, there is a growing need for \nthe dedicated training of healthcare professionals in the \nfundamental concepts and applications of AI. The anno -\ntation of condition-specific training data and design of \nefficient NLP pipelines are complex tasks, which require \nclose collaboration between the healthcare and technol -\nogy sectors to establish high-quality and scalable systems \ndespite existing disparities across the global healthcare \nsector. Rather than solely being the end-users of AI sys -\ntems, healthcare professionals should take a more active \nrole in the development of frameworks for specific \naspects of orthopaedic research and clinical care. Finally, \nexpert consensus is required to integrated labelled and \nunlabelled orthopaedic datasets to train LLMs and GAI \nmodels to perform domain-specific tasks, such as clini -\ncal concept extraction, medical relation extraction, and \nmedical question answering, with high efficiency, accu -\nracy and reliability.\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\nData sharing statement\nNot applicable.\nPatient and Public Involvement\nNot applicable.\nAuthors’ contributions\nThe initial manuscript was drafted by BZ and RF.
