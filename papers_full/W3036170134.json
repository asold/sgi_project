  "abstract": "This paper intends to prepare a nanofluid sample by suspending Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) at 0.005g/L concentration and analyze the behavior of electrical and dielectric properties based on the International Electrotechnical Commision test method. In order to validate the effectiveness of MWCNT nanofluid, alternating current breakdown voltage (BDV), negative polarity lightning impulse (LI), dielectric permittivity, dissipation factor (DF), DC resistivity and Raman structural measurement are executed accordingly. In the following, an analysis of the statistical distribution using the two-parameter Weibull distribution law of BDV and LI are evaluated at four experimental conditions to predict the probability of breakdown occurring at different percentages. Based on the observation, the MWCNT filler has a substantial effect in improving the BDV and LI characteristics of disposed mineral oil. The permittivity, DF and resistivity performance of MWCNT nanofluid from 25 °C to 90 °C also produces comparable and reliable performance as a fresh transformer oil. As for Raman structure, the revolution of transformer oil by doping MWCNT does not disrupt the original chemical structure of mineral oil. Hence, this study proves the improvement of the electrical and the behavior of dielectric properties and chemical structure of nanofluid, providing a huge contribution towards the development of insulating materials for transformer application.",
