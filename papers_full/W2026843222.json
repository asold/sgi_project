  "abstract": "Performing a dynamic analysis of an offshore wind turbine with an aero-elastic solver relies on the inclusion of a model to represent the behavior of the piled foundations. The most commonly used solution is the p-y method, which was developed for offshore oil and gas applications and has been extended to the offshore wind energy industry. There are several shortcomings with this method, however, which can affect the accuracy of wind turbine simulations. These shortcomings are identified and explained in this work. More advanced pile foundations models which account for many nonlinear behaviors ignored by the traditional p-y method have been developed in the past for applications unrelated to offshore wind turbines. These models can nevertheless be applied to offshore wind turbine simulations and are discussed herein. A proposed method for incorporating these so called ‘dynamic p-y’ models into wind turbine simulations is laid out and discussed.",
