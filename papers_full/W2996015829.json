    "abstract": "With an increasing interest in ultra-high frequency (UHF) partial discharge (PD) measurements for the continuous monitoring of power transformers, it is necessary to know where to place the UHF sensors on the tank wall. Placing a sensor in an area with many obstructions may lead to a decrease in sensitivity to the UHF signals. In this contribution, a previously validated simulation model of a three-phase 300 MVA, 420 kV power transformer is used to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the most sensitive sensor positions on the tank wall when PD activity occurs inside the windings. A matrix of UHF sensors located on the transformer tank is used to perform the sensitivity analysis. Some of the windings are designed as layer windings, thus preventing the UHF signals from traveling through them and creating a realistic situation with very indirect propagation from source to sensor. Based on these findings, sensor configurations optimized for UHF signal sensitivity, which is also required for PD source localization, are recommended for localization purposes. Additionally, the propagation and attenuation of the UHF signals inside the windings and the tank are discussed in both oil and air.",
