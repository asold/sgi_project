    "abstract": "Abstract The paper presents theoretical and experimental analyses of a possible effect of the short-circuit forces on the transformer winding. The first part of the paper is focused on creation and activity of the radial and axial forces during a short circuit. It shows dimensions, direction and − of course − the resulting mechanical stress. The presented equation shows basic dependencies of these mechanical forces created in the transformer winding. Finally, the paper presents experimental methods of diagnosing and analysing the effects of short-circuit forces on the transformer winding.",
