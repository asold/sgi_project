Through\nextensive experiments,Grenade shows its su-\nperiority over state-of-the-art methods. Im-\nplementation is available at https://github.com/\nbigheiniu/GRENADE.\n1 Introduction\nText-Attributed Graph (TAG) (Yang et al., 2021)\n(a.k.a., Textual Graph) has been widely used for\nmodeling a variety of real-world applications, such\nas information retrieval (Cohan et al., 2020; Yang\net al., 2021), product recommendation (Zhu et al.,\n2021) and many more. In TAG, each node rep-\nresents a text document, while the relationships\namong these text nodes are depicted by the edges.\nFor instance, in citation networks, text nodes rep-\nresent academic papers, and edges are the citation\nrelationship between different papers. To conduct\ndifferent analytics tasks onTAG, the key is to learn\nexpressive node representations for the text nodes.\n∗Corresponding Author.\nRecent research has demonstrated that self-\nsupervised learning (SSL) can substantially im-\nprove the effectiveness of representation learning\non text data (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019; Gao\net al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020) without using human\nsupervision. Thosemethodsarecommonlylearned\nunder the assumption that text documents are inde-\npendently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), which\nneglects the structural interdependencies among\ntext nodes onTAG. However, the interdependen-\ncies between different text documents can provide\nvaluable insights for understanding their semantic\nrelationships. Takecitationnetworksasanexample,\nthose academic papers (text nodes) that have cita-\ntionrelationshipsoftensharesimilartopics. Hence,\nit is necessary forSSL models to account for not\nonly textual semantics but also structural context\ninformation.\nIn fact, self-supervised representation learning\non TAG remains in its infancy:(i) Though recent\nresearch efforts (Zhao et al., 2022; Chien et al.,\n2021; Cohan et al., 2020; Yasunaga et al., 2022)\ntry to empower pre-trained language models (PLM)\nwith structural context information, most of them\nstill stay superficial by designing local structure-\ndependent SSL objectives. For example, both\nGIANT (Chien et al., 2021) andSPECTER (Cohan\net al., 2020) train the language model by inferring\nthe local neighborhood based on representations of\ntext nodes. However, simply relying on thoseSSL\nobjectives cannot help thePLM fully understand\ncomplex graph structures, especially compared to\nmodels like graph neural networks (GNN) (Kipf and\nWelling, 2017; Velickovic et al., 2018; Hamilton\net al., 2017; Ding et al., 2022a);(ii) Meanwhile,\nanother line of research (Mavromatis et al., 2023;\nZhao et al., 2022) try to combine the advantages\nof bothPLM and GNN by distilling the knowledge\nfromonetotheother(Hintonetal.,2015)andhave\nshown promising results. Nonetheless, one major\nissue is that those methods are task-specific (e.g.,\n2745\nsemi-supervised node classification) and require\nhuman-annotated labels to enable knowledge distil-\nlation. Such an inherent limitation jeopardizes the\nversatilityoftheirmodelsforhandlingdifferentand\neven unseen downstream tasks, which runs counter\nto the goal ofSSL.\nTo go beyond the existing learning paradigms\nand capture informative textual semantic and graph\nstructure information, we develop a new model for\nself-supervised learning onTAG, namelyGrenade\n(Graph-Centric Language Model). Grenade is\nbuilt with a PLM encoder along with an adju-\nvant GNN encoder that provides complementary\nknowledge for it. More importantly,Grenade is\nlearned through two new self-supervised learning\nalgorithms: Graph-Centric Contrastive Learning\n(GC-CL), astructure-awareand augmentation-free\ncontrastive learning algorithm that improves the\nrepresentation expressiveness by leveraging the in-\nherentgraphneighborhoodinformation;andGraph-\nCentric Knowledge Alignment (GC-KA), which en-\nables thePLM and GNN modules to reinforce each\nother by aligning their learned knowledge encoded\nin the text node representations.\nSpecifically,GC-CL enforces neighboring nodes\nto share similar semantics in the latent space by\nconsideringthemaspositivepairs. Evenwithoutus-\ning data augmentation,GC-CL performs node-wise\ncontrastive learning to elicit the structural context\ninformation from TAG. In the meantime,GC-KA\nbridges the knowledge gap betweenPLM and GNN\nby performing dual-level knowledge alignment on\nthecomputedrepresentations: atthenodelevel, we\nminimize the distance between the representations\nlearned from two encoders that focus on different\nmodalities. Attheneighborhoodlevel,weminimize\nthe discrepancy between two neighborhood simi-\nlarity distributions computed fromPLM and GNN.\nBy virtue of the two proposed graph-centric self-\nsupervisedlearningalgorithms,weareabletolearn\nGrenade that can generate expressive and general-\nizablerepresentationsforvariousdownstreamtasks\nwithout using any human supervision. In summary,\nour work has the following contributions:\n• We developGrenade, which is a graph-centric\nlanguage model that addresses the underexplored\nproblem of self-supervised learning onTAG.\n• We propose two new self-supervised learning\nalgorithms forTAG, which allow us to perform\ncontrastive learning and knowledge alignment in\na graph-centric way.\n• We conduct extensive experiments to show that\nourmodel Grenade significantlyandconsistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on a wide\nspectrum of downstream tasks.\n2 Problem Definition\nNotations. We utilize bold lowercase letters such\nasd torepresentvectors,boldcapitalletterslike W\nto denote matrices and calligraphic capital letters\nlikeWto represent sets. LetG= (A,D) denote\na text-attributed graph with adjacency matrixA ∈\n{0,1}|D|×|D|and text setD. The Aij = 1when\nthere is a connection between nodeiand j. Each\nnode irepresents a text document which consists\nof a sequence oftokensDi = {wv}|Di|\nv=0.\nProblem 1Given an input text-attributed graph\n(TAG) denoted asG=(A,D), our goal is to learn\na graph-centric language modelPLM(·), that can\ngenerate expressive and generalizable representa-\ntion for an arbitray node i onG: di=PLM(Di).\nNote that the whole learning process is performed\nsolely on the input graphGwithout the utilization\nof human-annotated labels.\n3 Proposed Approach: Graph-Centric\nLanguage Model (Grenade)\nTo learn expressive representations fromTAG in a\nself-supervised learning manner, we propose our\nGraph-Centric Language ModelGrenade, which\nbridges the knowledge gap between Pre-trained\nLanguage Model (PLM) and Graph Neural Network\n(GNN). By optimizing two distinct encoders with a\nsetofnovelself-supervisedlearningalgorithms,the\nPLM encoder andGNN encoder mutually reinforce\neach other, and we can finally derive our Graph-\nCentric Language Model (Grenade). GNN. The\noverall framework is shown in Fig. 1.\n3.1 Model Architecture\nOurproposedmodel Grenade iscomposedofaPre-\ntrained Language Model (PLM) along with a Graph\nNeuralNetwork( GNN),whichareoptimizedbyaset\nof novel self-supervised learning algorithms. We\nfirst introduce the details about those two essential\ncomponents as follows:\nPLM Encoder. The primary componentPLM(·) is\naBERT (Devlin et al., 2018) based text encoder that\nprojects a sequence of tokensDi into a vectorized\ntext node representationdi:\ndi=PLM(Di), (1)\n2746\nGraph-Centric Knowledge Alignment\nNBH-KA \t𝑖 236 45\t𝑖6243\n5\nND-KA\t𝑖6243\n5 \t𝑖 236 45Graph-Centric CL\nGC-CL \t𝑖 236 45\t𝑖6243\n5\nPLMEncoderGNNEncoder\t𝑖6243\n5\nKL\nPositive InstanceNegative InstanceTAG\t𝑖6243\n5\nFigure 1: Illustration ofGrenade. Given a text-attributed graph (TAG), Grenade is jointly optimized by two graph-\ncentric self-supervised learning algorithms: graph-centric contrastive learningGC-CL and a dual-level graph-centric\nknowledge alignment, which comprises node-level alignment (ND-KA) and neighborhood-level alignment (NBH-KA).\nwhere di is the hidden representation of the[CLS]\ntoken computed from the last layer of thePLM\nencoder.\nGNN Encoder. As an adjuvant component, the\nGNN encoderGNN(·) isbuiltwithastackofmessage-\npassing basedGNN layers, which compute the node\ni’s representation by iteratively aggregating and\ntransformingthefeatureinformationfromitsneigh-\nborhood (Hamilton et al., 2017). For each node\ni, its representation learned from aL-layer GNN\nencoder can be denoted as:\nei=E[i,:],E=GNN(E0,A) (2)\nwhere the input node feature matrixE0 is obtained\nfrom the hidden representations of[CLS] token\nfrom the last layer of a pre-trainedBERT model.\n3.2 Graph-Centric Contrastive Learning\nIn order to improve the learning capability of those\ntwo encoders without using any human-annotated\nlabels, one prevailing way is to conduct contrastive\nlearningfromeitherthetextperspective(Gaoetal.,\n2021) or graph perspective (Ding et al., 2022c).\nHowever, most of the existing contrastive learn-\ning methods have the following two limitations:\n(1) conventional instance-level contrastive learning\nmethods merely encourage instance-wise discrimi-\nnation (Li et al., 2021b; Ding et al., 2023), which\nneglects the property ofTAG, i.e., the relational\ninformation among text nodes. Hence, those in-\nstances that share similar semantics may be unde-\nsirablypushedawayinthelatentspace; (2)existing\nmethods commonly rely on arbitrary augmentation\nfunctions to generate different augmented views\nfor applying contrastive learning, while those aug-\nmentations may unexpectedly disturb the semantic\nmeaning of the original instance (Lee et al., 2022).\nTo counter the aforementioned issues, we pro-\npose a new graph-centric contrastive learning\n(GC-CL) algorithm, which isstructure-awareand\naugmentation-free. GC-CL exploits inherent graph\nknowledge fromTAG and can be applied to both\nthePLM encoder andGNN encoder. As suggested by\nthe Homophily principle (McPherson et al., 2001),\nneighboring nodes commonly share similar seman-\ntics, meaning that their representations should also\nbe close to each other in the latent space. Based\non the PLM representation of nodei, its K-hop\nneighboring nodesN(i), and the nodeiexcluded\nmini-batch instancesB(i), theGC-CL objective for\nPLM can be defined as follows:\nLGC-CL1 = −1\n|N(i)|\n∑\np∈N(i)\nlog esim(di,dp)/τ\n∑\nj∈C(i) esim(di,dj)/τ,\n(3)\nwhere τ denotes the temperature and sim(·,·)\nrepresents the cosine similarity function. Here\nC(i) =N(i) ∪B(i). Note that for nodei, we con-\nsiderits PLM representationdiasthequeryinstance.\nThe positive instances are the representations of\nnodei’sK-hopneighboringnodes {dp|p∈N(i)}.\nMeanwhile, the negative instances are the represen-\ntations of other text nodes excludingiwithin the\nsame mini-batch{dj|j ∈B(i)}.\nSimilar to thePLM encoder, we also apply our\nGC-CL algorithmtothe GNN encoderGNN(·). Specif-\n2747\nically, the objective function is defined as follows:\nLGC-CL2 = −1\n|N(i)|\n∑\np∈N(i)\nlog esim(ei,ep)/τ\n∑\nj∈C(i) esim(ei,ej)/τ,\n(4)\nwhere ei is the query instance. The positive in-\nstances are{ep|p ∈N (i)}and the negative in-\nstances are{ej|j ∈B(i)}.\nApart from the conventional instance-level con-\ntrastive learning counterparts, our graph-centric\ncontrastive learning also enforces neighboring\nnodes to share similar representations. In a sense,\nthisself-supervisedlearningalgorithmisanalogous\nto performing link prediction task based on the rep-\nresentations learned from thePLM encoder, which\ninherently elicits informative graph knowledge dur-\ning the learning process.\n3.3 Graph-Centric Knowledge Alignment\nIn this work, our ultimate goal is to learn expres-\nsive and generalizable representations that encode\ninformativetextualsemanticswithineachtextnode\nas well as the relational information among nodes.\nHowever,individuallyconductingthegraph-centric\ncontrastive learning on eitherPLM or GNN is not\nenough due to the lack of knowledge exchange be-\ntweenthem. Tobetteralignandenhancetheknowl-\nedge captured by thePLM and GNN encoders, we\nproposeadual-levelgraph-centricknowledgealign-\nmentalgorithmfor TAG,whichincludesNode-Level\nKnowledgeAlignment( ND-KA)andNeighborhood-\nLevel Knowledge Alignment (NBH-KA).\nNode-Level Knowledge Alignment. Different\nfrom the previously introduced graph-centric con-\ntrastive learning, which only focuses on single-\nmodal contrasting,ND-KA tries to align the knowl-\nedge across the two encoders by performing graph-\ncentric contrastive learning in a cross-modal form.\nForeachnode i,basedonitsrepresentationslearned\nfromthe PLM encoderand GNN encoder(i.e., di and\nei, respectively), we formulate the objective of\nND-KA as follows:\nLND-KA= −1\n|˜N(i)|\n∑\np∈˜N(i)\n(\nlog esim(ei,dp)/τ\n∑\nj∈˜C(i) esim(ei,dj)/τ\n+ log esim(di,ep)/τ\n∑\nj∈˜C(i) esim(di,ej)/τ\n)\n/2,\n(5)\nwhere ˜N(i) = {i}∪N (i) and ˜C(i) = ˜N(i) ∪\nB(i). Note that for nodei, we first considerei\nthat is learned from theGNN encoder as the query,\nthen construct the positive and negative instances\nbased on the representations learned from thePLM\nencoder. Specifically,thepositiveinstancesinclude\nboth the representation of nodei as well as the\nrepresentations ofi’s K-hop neighboring nodes\n(i.e., {dp|p ∈ ˜N(i)}), and the negative instances\naretherepresentationsofotherinstanceswithinthe\nsame mini-batch{dj|j ∈B(i)}. In the meantime,\nwe also consider thedi as the query and construct\nits corresponding positive and negative instances\nin the same way. Here we omit the illustration for\nsimplicity.\nBy virtue of the proposedND-KA algorithm, the\nrepresentations of the same node learned from two\nseparate encoders will be pulled together in the la-\ntentspace. Inthemeantime, ND-KA alsoencourages\nneighboring nodes to have similar representations\nacross different modalities.\nNeighborhood-Level Knowledge Alignment.\nTo further facilitate knowledge alignment between\nPLM and GNN, we propose Neighborhood-Level\nKnowledgeAlignment( NBH-KA)toaligntheneigh-\nborhood similarity distributions learned from the\ntwo encoders. Specifically,NBH-KA first computes\nthe neighborhood similarity distribution between\nthe query nodeiand itsK-hop neighboring nodes\nN(i) aswellastherestnodeswithinthesamemini-\nbatch B(i) for each encoder. Then we minimize\nthe KL-divergence between the two distributions\nto align the knowledge between two encoders. The\ncorresponding learning objective is:\nLNBH-KA=\n(\nKL(PPLM(i)||Pγ(i))\n+ KL(PGNN(i)||PPLM(i))\n)\n/2,\nPPLM(i)=softmaxj∈C(i)(sim(di,dj)/τ),\nPGNN(i)=softmaxj∈C(i)(sim(ei,ej)/τ),\n(6)\nwhere PPLM(i) and PGNN(i) are the neighborhood\nsimilarity distributions forPLM encoder andGNN\nencoder respectively. From a certain perspective,\nour NBH-KA algorithm can be considered a self-\nsupervised form of knowledge distillation. Specif-\nically, NBH-KA leverages the neighborhood infor-\nmation as self-supervision to guide the knowledge\nalignment process. Moreover, we conduct two-way\nknowledge alignment across two encoders, which\nis different from original knowledge distillation.\n2748\n3.4 Model Learning\nIn order to learn our graph-centric language model\nGrenade onTAG without using human-annotated\nlabels, we jointly optimize the proposed graph-\ncentric contrastive learning and knowledge align-\nment algorithms. For the sake of simplicity, we\ndefine the overall training loss as follows:\nL=LGC-CL1 + LGC-CL2 + LND-KA + LNBH-KA. (7)\nOnce the training is finished, we can freeze the\nparametersofthe PLM encoderanduseittocompute\ntherepresentationsofeachtextnodewithaforward\npass. The computed representations can be further\nused for different downstream tasks.\n4 Experiment\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our approach\nGrenade, we conduct comprehensive experiments\non different datasets and various downstream tasks.\n4.1 Experimental Setup\nEvaluation Datasets. We evaluate the general-\nizability of the representations computed from\ndifferent methods on three Open Graph Bench-\nmark (OGB) (Hu et al., 2020) datasets: ogbn-arxiv,\nogbn-products, ogbl-citation2. These datasets are\nutilizedtoevaluatetheperformanceoffew-shotand\nfull-shot node classification, node clustering, and\nlink prediction tasks. It should be noted that ogbn-\narxiv and ogbn-products datasets are not originally\ndesigned for link prediction evaluation. There-\nfore, we create two link prediction tasks based on\nthese two datasets, respectively. Furthermore, we\nincorporate obgl-citation2 into our node classifica-\ntion experiment. The statistical information of the\ndatasets is shown in Tab. 1. More comprehensive\ninformation regarding the dataset extension can be\nfound in Appendix A.\nDataset #Nodes #Edges #Classes\nogbn-arxiv 169,343 1,166,243 40\nogbn-products 2,449,029 61,859,140 47\nogbl-citations2 2,927,963 30,387,995 172\nTable 1: Statistical information of the datasets.\nBaseline Methods. The baseline methods in-\ncluded in our study encompass three categories:\n(1) Untuned representations:BERT (Devlin et al.,\n2018)and OGB representations(Mikolovetal.,2013;\nHu et al., 2020). ForBERT, we extract the final\nlayer’s hidden state of[CLS] token from frozen\nbert-base-uncased as the text node representa-\ntion. As for OGB, we utilize the default features\nfrom benchmark datasets, such as averaged word\nembeddings and bag-of-words representations.(2)\nText-only self-supervised representation learning\nmodels: BERT+MLM andSimCSE (Gao et al., 2021);\nIn BERT+MLM, we apply masked language model-\ning toBERT for the targetTAG. SimCSE employs\ninstance-wisecontrastivelearningtolearntextnode\nrepresentation. (3) Structure-augmented language\nmodels: This category includes SPECTER (Co-\nhan et al., 2020),GIANT (Chien et al., 2021) and\nGLEM (Zhao et al., 2022).SPECTER applies graph-\ncentric contrastive learning on the language model,\nandGIANT employstheextrememulti-labelclassifi-\ncationtotrainthelanguagemodelforneighborhood\nprediction. It is noteworthy thatGLEM utilizes task-\nspecific labels to alternatively guide the pre-trained\nlanguage modelPLM and graph neural networks\nGNN through self-knowledge distillation. Com-\npared withGLEM, our proposed methodGrenade\nis fully self-supervised and does not rely on any\nhuman-annotated labels. The learned text node\nrepresentations can be efficiently and effectively\ngeneralized to downstream tasks.\nImplementation Details. To ensure a fair com-\nparison, we implemented all baseline methods and\nGrenade using the same language model, specif-\nically bert-base-uncased. For our proposed\nmethod,Grenade, we set theK-hop neighbor as\n1, set the temperature parameterτ to 0.05 in all the\nlossfunctions. Theoptimalhyperparameter |N(i)|\nis discussed in § 4.5. Please refer to Appendix B\nfor additional implementation details.\n4.2 Experimental Results\nFew-shotNodeClassification. Toassessthegen-\neralizability of learned representation to new tasks\nunder low-data scenarios, we conduct experiments\non few-shot node classification. Under this set-\nting, the classification models are trained with\nvarying numbers of labeled instances per class\n(k = {2,4,8,16}).

We aim to\nrank the positive candidates (1 or 2 positive in-\nstances) higher than the negative candidates (1,000\nnegative instances) for each query node. The eval-\nuation metric used for this task is the mean recip-\nrocal rank (MRR), which measures the reciprocal\nrank of the positive instance among the negative\ninstances for each query instance and takes the av-\nerage over all query instances.

This suggests\nthat 1-hop neighbors optimally capture structural\nknowledge within our algorithm. However, when\nextending to2-hop or3-hop neighbors, there’s a\nheightened risk of integrating noisy data. This in-\nsightalignswiththeconclusionsdrawnfromrelated\nresearch,specifically SPECTER (Cohanetal.,2020).\nWe contend that our methodology strikes a harmo-\nnious balance between assimilating structural data\nandfilteringoutextraneousnoise, therebyensuring\nconsistent performance in our assessments.\n1 2 3\nNode Classification\n71.7\n72.1\n72.5\n72.9\n73.4ACC (%)\n1 2 3\nNode Clustering\n59.6\n60.3\n61.0\n61.6\n62.3\n1 2 3\nLink Prediction\n47.2\n48.7\n50.1\n51.5\n53.0\nMRR (%)\nFigure 4: Hyperparameter evaluation forK-hop neigh-\nbors in the ogbn-arxiv dataset.

Thisprobleminvolveslearn-\ning text node representations that encode both tex-\ntual semantics and structural context information.\n2752\nA prominent approach uses structure-augmented\nSSL objectives to incorporate structure informa-\ntion into language models (Chien et al., 2021;\nCohan et al., 2020; Yasunaga et al., 2022; Os-\ntendorff et al., 2022). For example,SPECTER and\nLinkBERT focus on node-pair relationships (Co-\nhan et al., 2020; Yasunaga et al., 2022), while\nGIANT targets extreme multiclass neighborhood\nprediction (Chien et al., 2021). A concurrent\nwork PATTON (Jin et al., 2023) trains a language\nmodel through network-contextualized masked lan-\nguage modeling and link prediction. A parallel\nline of research tries to integrate pre-trained lan-\nguage models (PLMs) with graph neural networks\n(GNN) (Yang et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022; Mavro-\nmatis et al., 2023; Shang et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,\n2021). GraphFormers interweavesGNN withLMs’\nself-attentionlayers(Yangetal.,2021). GLEM (Zhao\net al., 2022),GraDBERT (Mavromatis et al., 2023)\nand LRTN (Zhang et al., 2021) leverage labeled\ndatasetsforco-trainingbetween PLM andGNN.While\nthey excel in node classification benchmarks, their\nreliance on labeled datasets limits the representa-\ntion’s generalization ability to new tasks.\nContrastive Learning. Contrastive learning is a\nself-supervisedlearningparadigmthataimstolearn\nrepresentations by distinguishing between positive\nand negative instances (Jaiswal et al., 2020). A key\npractice in contrastive learning is to use augmented\nversions of the same instance as positive instances\nandotherinstancesasnegativeinstances(Gaoetal.,\n2021; He et al.; Radford et al., 2021). For ex-\nample,SimCSE creates augmented views for each\ninstance based on dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014).\nHowever, conventional instance-level contrastive\nlearning only encourages instance-wise discrimi-\nnation (Li et al., 2021b) and commonly assumes\ndifferentinstancesare i.i.d.,whichneglectstherela-\ntionships among different instances onTAG. Hence,\nconventional contrastive learning methods are inef-\nfective to learn expressive representation learning\nonTAG. To address those limitations, many recent\nmethods seek to extend the design of positive pair\nconstruction by considering local neighborhood\ninformation (Cohan et al., 2020; Ostendorff et al.,\n2022). However, those methods cannot fully cap-\nture complex graph structures. In contrast, our pro-\nposed method,Grenade, leverages graph-centric\ncontrastive learning and graph-centric knowledge\nalignment to fully exploit the structural context\ninformation fromTAG.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce a self-supervised graph-\ncentric language model: Grenade, for learning\nexpressive and generalized representation from tex-\ntual attributed graphs (TAG). Grenade is learned\nthrough two self-supervised learning algorithms:\n(1) Graph-Centric Contrastive Learning, which\nenables Grenade to harness intrinsic graph knowl-\nedge through relational-aware and augmentation-\nfree contrastive learning; and(2) Graph-Centric\nKnowledge Alignment, which facilitates the ex-\nchange and strengthening of knowledge derived\nfrom the pre-trained language model encoder and\nthe graph neural network encoder, thereby en-\nhancing the capture of relational information from\nTAG. We conduct experiments on four benchmark\ndatasetsunderfew-shotandfulldatanodeclassifica-\ntion, node clustering, and link prediction tasks, and\nfind thatGrenade significantly and consistently\noutperforms baseline methods.\n7 Limitations\nIn this section, we acknowledge the following\nconstraints in our study:(1) Constraints on the\nChoice of Backbone Model. Our choice of the\nbackbone model was restricted to the initialization\nof “bert-base-uncased” in trainingGrenade.\nThis choice was necessitated by the limitations\nin computational resources available to us. Ex-\nploration with alternativePLM backbones such as\nGPT2(Radford et al., 2019) andRoBERTa(Liu et al.,\n2019) has not been carried out and represents a\npromising direction for subsequent studies. (2)\nComparisonwithLargeLanguageModels. Thenat-\nural language processing domain has recently seen\nbreakthroughs with state-of-the-art large language\nmodels likeLLaMA(Touvron et al., 2023) and Chat-\nGPT (OpenAI, 2023), which have demonstrated\nexceptionalperformanceinlanguageunderstanding\ntasks. Our experiment confirms thatGrenade sur-\npasses existing representation learning techniques\nin TAG, but the performance ofGrenade relative\nto these cutting-edge language models remains to\nbe ascertained.(3) Breadth of Evaluation.In this\nwork,weevaluate Grenade primarilythroughnode\nclassification, node clustering, and link prediction\ntasks. However, there are other relevant evaluation\ndimensions, such as retrieval, reranking, co-view\nandothers(Cohanetal.,2020).
