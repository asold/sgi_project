  "abstract": "As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to advance, we must understand their strategic importance in national security. This paper focuses on unique AI applications in the military, emphasizes strategic imperatives for success, and aims to rekindle excitement about AI's role in national security. We will examine the United States progress in integrating AI into the battle space, discuss the importance of securing these technologies from adversaries, and explore the challenges and risks associated with their integration. Finally, we will highlight the strategic significance of AI to national security and a set of strategic imperatives for military leaders and policymakers.",
