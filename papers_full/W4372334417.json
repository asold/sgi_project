[1], which delved into the limitations and \nethical implications of using ChatGPT in critical deci -\nsion-making processes. While we appreciate the authors’ \nconcerns and the importance of exercising caution when \nusing language models like ChatGPT, we would like to \nhighlight some alternative perspectives on this rapidly \nevolving technology.\nTo begin, we agree with the authors that new technolo-\ngies should not be blindly adopted without proper under-\nstanding and evaluation. It is indeed crucial to be aware \nof the strengths and limitations of tools like ChatGPT, as \nwell as their potential impact on various fields. However, \nit is also important to consider the remarkable advance -\nments that have been made in recent years and the ben -\neficial applications of language models.\nFor instance, following two major earthquakes in Tur -\nkey, OpenAI’s GPT model [2] was employed to identify \nsurvivors’ locations, as reported on Twitter. As a result, \nnearly thousand of people were rescued from the wreck -\nage. This example demonstrates that when used appro -\npriately and with human supervision, language models \nlike ChatGPT can play a significant role in disaster man -\nagement, public health, and other critical areas.\nFurthermore, the authors’ comparison of ChatGPT \nto a self-driving system navigating a rocket to low earth \norbit offers a valuable perspective. While it is true that \nwe should not use a tool designed for one purpose in an \nentirely different context, it is also essential to recognize \nthe potential of these models to be adapted and improved \nfor specific tasks. The development of specialized sys -\ntems for summarizing scientific articles, for example, is \nnot far-fetched and can significantly benefit researchers \nand practitioners across disciplines [3].\nIt is worth noting that the adoption of technology often \nfollows a pattern of initial resistance, gradual accept -\nance, and eventual obsolescence as newer, better solu -\ntions emerge [4]. A prime example of this can be seen in \nthe 1988 protest actions by mathematics teachers in the \nUSA, who sought to ban the use of calculators in primary \nschools, as well as Fig.  1. [5]. Fast forward to the present \nday, the use of calculators has become far less prevalent, \nparticularly in educational settings, as more advanced \ndevices have rendered them almost obsolete.\nIn conclusion, we would like to express my gratitude to \nAzamfirei et  al. for raising essential questions and con -\ncerns about the use of language models like ChatGPT. As \ntechnology advances at an accelerating pace, it is our col -\nlective responsibility to ensure that we understand, evalu-\nate, and harness these tools for the betterment of society. \nBy engaging in constructive discussions like the one \nThis reply refers to the comment available online at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ \ns13054- 023- 04393-x.\n*Correspondence:\nIzzet Turkalp Akbasli\nizzetakbasli@gmail.com\n1 Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, \nAnkara, Turkey\n2 The Center for Life Support Practice and Research, Hacettepe University, \nAnkara, Turkey\n3 Department of Pediatric Intesive Care Medicine, Hacettepe University, \nAnkara, Turkey\nPage 2 of 2Akbasli and Bayrakci  Critical Care          (2023) 27:172 \n•\n \nfast, convenient online submission\n •\n  \nthorough peer review by experienced researchers in your ﬁeld\n• \n \nrapid publication on acceptance\n• \n \nsupport for research data, including large and complex data types\n•\n  \ngold Open Access which fosters wider collaboration and increased citations \n \nmaximum visibility for your research: over 100M website views per year •\n  At BMC, research is always in progress.\nLearn more biomedcentral.com/submissions\nReady to submit y our researc hReady to submit y our researc h  ?
