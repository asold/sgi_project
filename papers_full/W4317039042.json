The current review of the literature was performed in order to shed more light on concepts, \nrationale, tools and uses of community health needs and assets assessment.\nMethods We conducted a scoping review of the literature published in English using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web \nof Science, PDQ evidence, NIH database, Cochrane library, CDC library, Trip, and Global Health Library databases until \nMarch 2021.\nResults A total of 169 articles including both empirical papers and theoretical and conceptual work were ulti‑\nmately retained for analysis. Relevant concepts were examined guided by a conceptual framework. The empirical \npapers were dominantly conducted in the  United States. Qualitative, quantitative and mixed‑method approaches \nwere used to collect data on community health needs and assets, with an increasing trend of using mixed‑method \napproaches. Almost half of the included empirical studies used participatory approaches to incorporate commu‑\nnity inputs into the process.\nConclusion Our findings highlight the need for having holistic approaches to assess community’s health needs \nfocusing on physical, mental and social wellbeing, along with considering the broader systems factors and structural \nchallenges to individual and population health. Furthermore, the findings emphasize assessing community health \nassets as an integral component of the process, beginning foremost with community capabilities and knowledge. \nThere has been a trend toward using mixed‑methods approaches to conduct the assessment in recent years that led \nto the inclusion of the voices of all community members, particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. A nota‑\nble gap in the existing literature is the lack of long‑term or longitudinal–assessment of the community health needs \nassessment impacts.\nKeywords Community, Health Needs Assessment, Needs Assessment, Assets Assessment, Population Health, \nScoping Review\n*Correspondence:\nZhaleh Abdi\nzh‑abdi@sina.tums.ac.ir\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 20Ravaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \nBackground\nThe population-based health approach aims to improve \nthe population’s health, promote community resilience \nand reduce health inequities across the socioeconomic \ngradient via inter-sectoral partnerships among com -\nmunity groups, government, healthcare systems, and \nother stakeholders [1]. One key feature for adopting a \npopulation-based health approach is to ensure that it is \ngrounded on a solid understanding of community health \nneeds and assets by triangulating evidence from service \nproviders and community members on services avail -\nability, accessibility, utilization and experience [2, 3]. \nThe process of identification of unmet health needs in a \npopulation is crucial for local authorities seeking to plan \nappropriate and effective programmes to meet these \nneeds [3, 4]. If these needs are ignored, then there is a risk \nof a top-down approach for providing health services, \nreflecting what a few people perceive to be the needs of \nthe population rather than what they actually are [4, 5].\nIn this context, community health needs assessment is \na means of developing a comprehensive understanding of \na community’s health and health needs as well as design -\ning interventions to improve community health [6]. \nThough the process of community health needs assess -\nment can be conducted in several ways, the primary \npurpose is to provide community leaders or healthcare \nproviders with an overview of local policy, systems, and \nenvironmental change strategies currently in place and \nhelp to identify areas for improvement [7]. Community \nhealth needs assessment can provide them with a more \nnuanced understanding of the communities they serve, \nmaking them aware of pressing issues that require sys -\ntem-level changes and support their efforts for resource \nmobilization to initiate innovative programmes [8, 9]. \nThe process to gather evidence on community health \nneeds can also serve as a springboard to strengthen com -\nmunity engagement [10].\nIn general, needs assessments are usually designed to \nevaluate gaps between current situations and desired \noutcomes, along with possible solutions to address the \ngaps. Recently, there has been a trend to move away \nfrom framing a community with a deficit perspective \n(need-based approach) to focus on community assets \nand resources, called community health needs and assets \nassessment [11, 12]. In contrast to a need-based perspec -\ntive which focuses on local deficits and resources outside \nthe community, an asset-based perspective focuses on \nhoning and leveraging existing strengths within the com -\nmunity to address community needs [12–14].\nStudies have shown that community health needs \nassessment is used widely by different users and across \ndifferent settings [15, 16]. However, these studies var -\nied widely in terms of purpose, process and methods of \nconducting community health needs assessment. Fur -\nthermore, the extent to which an asset-based approach is \nused is unclear, beyond the inclusion in guidance and rec-\nommendations. Thus, to support national or local deci -\nsion-makers to make informed choices about the scope, \ntools, methods and use of community health needs and \nassets assessment, this scoping review of the literature \naimed at: 1) Providing conceptual clarity on community \nhealth needs and assets assessment, 2) Determining for \nwhat purpose and with what methods community health \nneeds and assets assessment are used globally, 3) Drawing \nthe lessons learnt from previous experience with commu-\nnity health needs and assets assessment: what works in \nwhat context and under what conditions, 4) Document -\ning evidence of impact of community health needs and \nassets assessment, 5) Consolidating tools and methods \nused to collect evidence/data underpinning community \nhealth needs and assets assessment processes.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nTen databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, \nWeb of Science, PDQ evidence, NIH database, Cochrane \nlibrary, CDC library, Trip, and Global Health Library \nwere searched in February and March 2021. The search \nstrategy was developed through discussion with experts \nin the field of population health, a research librarian, and \na narrative review of the literature. Preliminary search \nterms were developed by the research team to reflect a \nnumber of core concepts including needs, population, \nneeds assessment, assets assessment and participation. \nThe search process was performed by a librarian with \nexpertise in the use of literature databases (SK). The \nsearch terms were pilot-tested and agreed upon within \nthe research team. The PubMed database search strategy \npresented in Additional file 1.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nStudies that focus on community health needs and assets \nassessment in terms of concepts, rationale, uses and \ntools were considered in both high-income countries \n(HICs) and low-and middle-income counties (LIMCs). \nWe included studies in the review if they met the follow -\ning criteria: 1) Papers providing conceptual clarity and \nexplaining rationale for community health needs and \n(assets) assessment (This can be articles describing com -\nmunity health needs assessment or community assets \nassessment or community health needs and assets assess-\nments at the same time or separately). The terms capabil-\nities/ strengths/ resources can be used in place of assets \nand were considered.); 2) Papers describing or evaluat -\ning experiences implementing community health needs \n(and assets) assessment in a single site or multiple sites; \nPage 3 of 20\nRavaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \n \n3) Methodological papers describing tools/approaches \nfor community health needs (and assets) assessment; 4) \nReview of the literature on community health needs (and \nassets) assessment.\nTypes of papers not include in the review were: 1) \nStudies without a clear description of the community \nhealth needs and (assets) assessment methods, 2) Stud -\nies assessed a single dimension (i.e. health outcomes \nonly, or healthcare providers’ capabilities only such as \npatient surveys, health outcomes dashboard, health \nfacility assessment), 3) Studies related to a single dis -\nease or programme, 4) Studies focused only on engag -\ning individual patient in their own care, and 5) Studies \nwere not in English.\nThree reviewers participated in the selection of the \nrelevant studies (HR, ZA, NN). The eligibility and rele -\nvance of the articles were determined by two reviewers \nindependently using the above predefined criteria. In the \nevent of disagreement, a consensus was found between \nall the reviewers about the status of the article.\nData extraction\nSeparate data extraction forms were developed for the \nextraction of the three main categories of papers: con -\nceptual, empirical and review papers. Totally, 121 empiri-\ncal papers (including 6 review papers) and 48 conceptual \nand methodological papers  were reviewed. Following \ntopics were extracted for empirical papers: 1) General \ncharacteristics including author(s), year of publication, \ncountry of implementation, study objective(s) and study \nmethod; 2) Community health needs and (assets) assess -\nment framing including rational, definitions of commu -\nnity health needs and (assets) assessment/ needs/ assets/ \ncommunity, initiator(s) or user(s) of the process;  3) Key \nsteps of the process, collected data, data collection tools; \n4) Community engagement and the level of engagement; \n5) Use of community health needs and (assets) assess -\nment findings, impact of community health needs and \n(assets) assessment; 6) Facilitators and barriers. Data \nextraction forms are presented in Additional file 2.\nData extraction forms were pilot-tested prior to the \nimplementation. Two authors (ZA, HR) independently \nperformed a pilot data extraction of a random sample of \nten original articles. After piloting, the authors assessed \nthe extracted data in relation to the scoping review \nquestions and revised them accordingly. The content of \nthe form was finalized by discussion within the team. \nRegarding conceptual papers, two authors (NN and ZA) \ninitially extracted data from three randomly selected \npapers and subsequently refined and amended the form \nhaving research team inputs.\nFour reviewers extracted included studies indepen -\ndently. The data extracted were cross-checked by one of \nthe authors and mutual consensus resolved discrepan -\ncies. Individual data extraction forms of empirical papers \nwere then merged into a single, unifying document used \nfor the interpretation and presentation of the results. Fol-\nlowing typical scoping review methods, the methodo -\nlogical quality of the included articles was not assessed \nFig. 1 Conceptual framework of the review\nPage 4 of 20Ravaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \nsystematically, however, only peer-reviewed articles were \nincluded in our review process [17].\nSynthesis of results\nFollowing reading and extracting conceptual papers, a \npreliminary conceptual framework (Fig. 1) was developed \nand discussed and agreed upon by team members. The \nintegrative synthesis of the evidence was employed. Spe -\ncifically, it involved the narrative description of concepts \nand definitions, key steps of the community health needs \nassessment and barriers and facilitators of the imple -\nmenting community health needs assessment.\nResults\nThe study selection process is summarized in Fig.  2. Just \nover 12,000 records were obtained from the ten data -\nbases searched. Articles with obviously irrelevant titles \nwere excluded, as were news items, letters, editorials, \nbook reviews, and articles appearing in newsletters or \nmagazines rather than peer review journals. The remain -\ning abstracts were retrieved, read and assessed. A total \nof 169 articles including both empirical papers and the -\noretical and conceptual work were ultimately retained \nfor analysis. A list of all studies with a short description, \nincluding the year of publication, key focus, study period, \nand methods, is presented in Additional files 3 and 4. The \nfirst part of the results section focuses on definitions and \nconcepts of community health needs assessment using \nboth conceptual and empirical papers. In the second \npart of the results section, we describe key steps of the \ncommunity health needs assessment and tools and meth-\nods used to collect data through content analysis of 121 \nincluded empirical papers. We also report some impor -\ntant challenges and facilitators faced by included studies \nwhile performing community health needs assessment. \nRole of community participation in the process and the \nspectrum and types of the participation is discussed in \nthe last part.\nGeneral characteristics of the included studies\nThe review showed that community health needs assess -\nment is used widely by different users and across different \nFig. 2 Information flow in scoping review\nPage 5 of 20\nRavaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \n \nsettings in both HICs and LMICs. Among included \nempirical studies, 81 (out of 121) were conducted in \nthe  United States (US). There were papers from Australia \n(n = 4), South Africa (n = 3), Kenya (n = 3), Uinted King -\ndom (UK) (n = 2), Canada (n = 2), China (n = 2), Domini-\ncan Republic (n = 2), Republic of Ireland (n = 2), Iran \n(n = 2), India (2), Honduras (n = 1), Netherland (n = 1), \nVietnam (n = 1), Sudan (n = 1), New Zealand (n = 1), \nMadagascar (n = 1), Malaysia (n = 1), Ecuador (n = 1), \nIndonesia (n = 1), Uganda (n = 1), Taiwan (n = 1), Kyr-\ngyzstan (n = 1), Saudi Arabia (n = 1), Haiti (n = 1), Hon-\nduras (n = 1) and Korea (n = 1).\nDefinition of needs\nThe review showed “need” was a multi-faceted con -\ncept with no universal definition. There was a differen -\ntiation between “health need” and “healthcare need” in \nthe reviewed literature. Healthcare needs can benefit \nfrom health care (health education, disease prevention, \ndiagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation  and terminal care). \nHealthcare providers usually consider needs in terms of \nhealthcare services that they can supply. However, health \nneeds incorporate the wider social and environmental \ndeterminants of health, such as deprivation, housing, \ndiet, education and employment. This broader defini -\ntion allows looking beyond the confines of the medical \nmodel based on health services, to the wider influences \non health [3].\nIn this review, relatively few empirical studies focus \nnarrowly on healthcare  needs, without attention to \nother determinants of health that can affect health \n[18–23]. Most of the included empirical studies looked \nbeyond “physical health needs” to consider wider “social \ndeterminants of health” or non-medical factors that can \naffect a person’s overall health and health outcomes as \nthe conditions—shaped by political, social, and eco -\nnomic forces—in which people are born, grow, live, \nwork, and age [24]. Notably, the need was recognised \nas a “dynamic concept” whose definition will vary with \ntime according to context and resources available to \naddress these needs [16].\nDefinition of community\nIn general, “community” has been defined as “people \nwith a basis of common interests and network of per -\nsonal interactions grouped either based on locality or \non a specific shared concerns or both” [25]. Shared com -\nmon interests are particularly important as they can \nbe assessed and, hopefully, met at a community level \n[26]. Importantly, community is a dynamic concept as \nindividuals can belong to several communities at vari -\nous times. In our review, community was defined by \nincluded studies, particularly those initiated by local \nauthorities or healthcare providers (e.g., hospitals), \nbased on geographical indicators such as county desig -\nnations or based on the location of the hospital’s/facil -\nity’s/authority’s existing or potential service users. Some \nincluded empirical studies considered community based \non shared interests or characteristics such as race/eth -\nnicity, sexual orientation, or occupation. Medically \nunderserved populations including rural areas [27– 30], \nimpoverished urban sectors [31], the homeless [32– 35], \npersons in poverty or of low socioeconomic status, vul -\nnerable children and families [18, 28, 36–38], the elderly \n[8, 39–42], women and girls [43– 47], LGBT (Lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, and transgender) individuals [48– 51], dis -\nplaced populations, immigrants and racial, ethnic and \nreligious minority groups [12, 19, 36, 42, 52–78] and per-\nsons with severe and chronic health problems [79] were \nconsidered as a “community” by a number of included \nstudies.\nWhile defining community, a number of its charac -\nteristics were determined by included studies including: \nhistory, existing groups, physical aspects (i.e. geographic \nlocation, community size, its topography  and etc.), \ninfrastructure (i.e. health and social care facilities, pub -\nlic transportation, roads, bridges, electricity, mobile tel -\nephone services and etc.), demographics (i.e. age, gender, \nrace and ethnicity, marital status, education, number of \npeople in household, first language and etc.), economic \nconditions, deprivation and/or inequalities, government/\npolitics, community leaders (formal and informal), com -\nmunity culture (formal and informal), existing institu -\ntions, crime and community safety, lifestyle and leisure, \ngeneral health problems and epidemiology.\nIn our review, community health needs and assets \nassessment were performed by different organizations as \nthe first step in community health promotion planning, \nincluding local health authorities (district/local), com -\nmunity entities [i.e. non-governmental organizations \n(NGOs), civil society organizations (CSOs), faith-based \norganizations (FBOs), community-based organizations \n(CBOs)] and hospitals (public/private). Included studies \nmostly conducted health needs assessment at the local \nlevel (e.g. cities, counties, or other municipalities). The \nbroader understanding of health and its determinants \nsuggests that many public and private entities have a \nstake in or can affect the community’s health. To engage \nstakeholders in the process, a number of included empir -\nical studies (n = 56, 49%) sought representatives from \nthe community that were best positioned to speak about \ncommunity health based on their specific knowledge or \nline of work. These stakeholders were individuals from \ncommunity and entities who may explicitly be concerned \nwith health or not, which varied by the community con -\ntext and culture. To have a comprehensive overview of \nPage 6 of 20Ravaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \na community needs, it was asserted that defining com -\nmunities needs to be dynamic and socially constructed \nto take into account all voices and members, especially \nthose not ordinarily included [80]. Community should \nbe defined in a manner that does not exclude medi -\ncally underserved, low-income, or minority populations. \nIntegrating community voices is especially important \nin designing plans and programmes aimed at reducing \nhealth disparities in the community [58, 81, 82].\nDefinition of assets\nOverall, there were limited definitions for “community \nassets” in the reviewed literature. Assets were described \nas resources, places, businesses, organizations, and \npeople that can be mobilized to improve the commu -\nnity [11, 83]. This includes members of the community \nthemselves and their capabilities. Assets can therefore \nbe described as the collective resources which indi -\nviduals and communities have at their disposal, which \nprotect against adverse health outcomes and promote \nhealth status [83, 84].\nOf 115 included empirical studies, 30 studies addressed \ncommunity assets while performing community health \nneeds assessment. A wide range of assets, from tangible \nresources to intangible ones, were considered that can be \nclassified into seven broad categories as follows:\n1) Community demographic characteristics: Literacy \nrates [13], youth population [58, 68], and elderly pop-\nulation [68];\n2) Natural capitals: Geographical location and natural \nresources [21, 81, 85];\n3) Economic and financial capitals: Community busi -\nness [12, 81] community members’ income [21], \nand housing land ownership [13];\n4) Community infrastructure: Level of technology/\nmobile phone coverage [13, 21], transportation [86], \nparks and sidewalks [12], sport and recreational facil-\nities [31, 87, 88], public libraries and community cen-\ntres [88];\n5) Community social and educational facilities: Non-\nprofit and non-governmental organizations [59, 87], \nmedia [89], educational institutions [12, 31, 81, 90], \nfaith communities [58, 81, 90], and community asso -\nciations [31];\n6) Community health and social facilities: Health and \nsocial facilities and providers [72, 81, 85, 86, 89], tra-\nditional medicine providers [72], and ongoing health \nprogrammes [13, 87];\n7) Community’s social and cultural values and resources: \nTribal and community culture [58, 68, 74, 91], cultural \ndiversity [81], spirituality and religion [58, 74], strong \nfamily bonds and values [59, 74], strong community \nconnections, teamwork and willingness to volunteer \n[21, 81, 86, 91], mutual support, social support and \nnetworks [45, 58, 81, 85], unity, community cohe -\nsion and collectivity [21, 59, 74], community capac -\nity [58], community-led activities [86, 91], and com -\nmunity values and traditions [68, 74, 86], resiliency \n[58], unifying power of communities [13], community \nadministration units e.g. women’s committees [13], an \nexisting group of dedicated healthcare providers [39], \na group of concerned citizens [39], community safety \n[12], the knowledge base of the community members \nthemselves [39] and members’ desire to be healthy \n[58].\nVarious qualitative methods such as individual inter -\nviews (one-on-one structured conversations) or focus \ngroups (guided, structured, small group discussions) with \ncommunity members, or key informants’ interviews (for -\nmal and informal conversations with leaders and stake -\nholder groups) or a combination of these methods were \nreported as the main methods to collect information on \ncommunity’s assets among reviewed studies. Of these, \nfocus group was the widely used method in community \nassets assessment [8, 21, 31, 45, 58, 59, 67, 81, 82, 85, 87, \n90, 92, 93].\nDefinition of community health needs (and assets) \nassessment\nThe terms “Community Needs Assessment (CNA)” , \n“Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA)” , and \n“Community Health Needs and Assets Assessment \n(CHNAA)” were used interchangeably in the literature \nreferring to the process of identifying health needs \n(and assets) of a given community. Since this review \nfocuses on both community needs and assets, we will \nuse the CHNAA term for the description of the pro -\ncess in this paper.\nNone of the papers reviewed provided a specific defi -\nnition for CHNAA. In general, reviewed papers defined \nCHNAA as: A collaborative, community-engaged, sys -\ntematic, ongoing, continuous, proactive, comprehen -\nsive, cyclical, regular, modifying method or process [28, \n33, 69, 92, 94–98]; For the identification, collection, \nassembly, analysis, distribution, and dissemination of \ninformation on key health needs, social needs, concerns, \nproblems, gaps, issues, factors, capabilities, strengths, \nassets, resources; About communities (or individu -\nals) [21, 23, 28, 31, 33, 37, 41, 45, 54, 79, 89, 94–97, \n99–102]; To achieve agreed priorities, create a shared \nvision, plan actions, garner resources, engage stakehold -\ners, work collaboratively, establish relationships, imple -\nment culturally appropriate, multi-sectoral/multilevel \nintervention strategies, empower residents and enhance \nPage 7 of 20\nRavaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \n \ncommunity capacity and participation in decision-mak -\ning process [12, 13, 20, 27, 28, 37, 45, 70, 79, 89, 91, 92, \n94, 95, 97–99, 101–104]; Towards improving health and \nwellbeing, building and transforming health of the com -\nmunities, increasing community benefits, reducing ine -\nqualities; Through which primary/secondary healthcare \ncan respond to local and national priorities [20, 23, 28, \n40, 51, 59, 69, 97, 103, 105, 106].\nThe included studies listed a number of reasons as the \nrationale for conducting CHNAA. Legislative require -\nments were most cited as the main rational for conducting \nCHNAA, particularly among studies conducted in the UK \nand US. Since the late 1980s, the concept of health needs \nassessment has gained increasing prominence within the \nNational Health Service (NHS) in the UK. This has been \nprompted by a series of policy initiatives requiring health \nfacilities to assess needs of their populations and to use \nthese assessments to set priorities to improve the health \nof their local population [107, 108]. In the US, several \nnational, federal, state, and local funding sources require \nentities to conduct CHNAA to demonstrate a significant \nneed for their services and programmes to be funded. \nThe most important one is Patient Protection and Afford-\nable Care Act (ACA-2010), requiring non-profit hospitals \nas tax-exempt entities to perform CHNAAs to maintain \nnon-profit status regularly [92]. Other reasons were men-\ntioned by included studies as the rationales for conduct -\ning CHNAA were: lack of information of health needs \nof a specific community, to facilitate health research and \nrelated interventions in a community, to inform the design \nof contextually relevant programmes and policies, to \ndevelop community health improvement plans or health \npromotion interventions, to develop or update strategic \nplans, and to receive resources and funds.\nKey steps to conduct CHNAA\nThe number and nature of CHNAA process steps varied \namong reviewed studies. However, broadly CHNAAs \ninvolved six main steps as follow:\nFormulation of a leadership team\nForming a leadership team, which was called by dif -\nferent names such as the steering committee/ the \nresearch advisory committee (RAC)/ the collaborative \ntask force/ or the community advisory board (CAB), \nwas known as the preliminary step of a CHNAA pro -\ncess. The steering committee was usually composed of \nlocal representatives from local agencies and organiza -\ntions (e.g. non-profit organizations, community ser -\nvice agencies, media outlets, county and municipal \ngovernments, colleges and universities, faith-based \norganizations, and healthcare providers), commu -\nnity members, community stakeholders and leaders, \nacademic partners, health and social officials, and rep -\nresentatives from the investigator body to help guide \nthe development of the CHNAA project.\nLeadership team responsibilities were reported as pro -\nviding inputs on the research purpose, selecting and veri-\nfying study methodology and design, providing inputs \nand feedback on initial survey/topic content and select -\ning final survey/ topic guide questions, reviewing survey/\ntopic guide length, and ensuring culturally relevant and \nresonant wording, comprehension and face validity, and \nmonitoring the progress of the data collection. Feedback \nand recommendations from the steering committee were \nincorporated throughout the CHNAA process as well. \nSteering committees usually met on a regular basis.\nIdentification of needs, assets and prioritisation\nTo collect information on community health, needs and \nassets, both primary and secondary data were utilized \nby included studies. Secondary data included informa -\ntion on community socio-demographic and indicators \non health status, access, utilization and satisfaction with \nhealth and social services at different levels (e.g. com -\nmunity, sub-national and national) to develop a picture \nof the overall community health. Primary data were col -\nlected through quantitative and qualitative methods and \nmixed-methods approaches.\nQuantitative studies  Some empirical studies used indi-\nvidual/household surveys as the only source to identify \ncommunity needs and concerns (n = 28, 24.%). Surveys \nwere a popular method of gathering opinions, preferences \nand perceptions of needs. Needs assessment surveys typ -\nically have written, closed-ended questions filled through \nthe interview (face to face/telephone) or self-completion \n(paper or online) by community members. Generally, two \nmain kinds of surveys were used by included studies: a) \ncommunity health assessment survey, and b) commu -\nnity concerns survey. A number of included studies used \nhealth assessment surveys as the key data sources of the \nCHNAA process (n = 22, 19%) or along with other types \nof data, mainly qualitative data (n = 21, 18.%). Health \nassessment surveys typically collected information on \ndemographics, socio-economic variables, respondents’ \nhealth status, choice of healthcare providers, and health -\ncare access issues among community members. Survey \nquestionnaires were mostly developed with inputs from \nthe literature review (similar health assessment surveys \nconducted at the local or national level), community \nmembers and project team discussions. Additional file  5 \nshows the most important data and indicators collected \nby included studies through conducting  community \nhealth  assessment surveys.\nPage 8 of 20Ravaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \nAnother form of surveys, used alone or in combina -\ntion with qualitative methods (n = 15, 13.5%), was the \ncommunity concerns survey in which people (commu -\nnity members and/or key informants) are asked to help \nidentify what they see as the most important issues fac -\ning their community leading to an inventory of their \nhealth priorities [12, 20, 23, 27, 29, 55, 69, 74, 101, 103, \n109–113]. A straightforward way to estimate the needs \nof a community was to simply ask residents their opin -\nion on what particular services are most needed in the \ncommunity. The focus of this methodology was to create \nan agenda based on the perceived needs and concerns of \ncommunity residents. The concerns surveys were based \non either focus group discussion with community mem -\nbers and experts or literature review by the researchers \nor both. Generally, while filling community concerns sur-\nvey, individuals were asked to rate the importance of each \nissue in their community on a scale (e.g. 0 = not impor-\ntant, 5 = extremely important) [23, 27, 29, 55, 74, 110]. \nParticipants could also add and rate concerns or service \nneeds that were not listed. Finally, each health problem \nidentified by the community was weighted based on the \nfrequency it was selected on the survey.\nGeneral coverage of the surveys was the population \naged 18 or over currently residing in the community \nfor a minimum period of time (at least a few months) \nand able to provide consent for participation. Most \nsurveys were written, closed-ended questions filled \nthrough face to face or telephone interviews or self-\ncompletion by community members. In addition to the \npaper-form survey, some studies used email and social \nmedia platforms to allow residents to anonymously \ncomplete online surveys [29, 51, 57, 96, 103, 110, 114]. \nA few studies reported that residents received mon -\netary or nonmonetary incentives for their participation \nupon survey completion [19, 71, 74, 77, 110]. Sampling \ntechniques commonly used are those that promote par -\nticipation in CHNAAs such as convenience sampling \n[20, 35, 40, 51, 52, 57, 64, 65, 71, 74, 75, 77, 86, 96, 101, \n103, 104, 110, 114, 115]. Only a few studies used ran -\ndom sampling or demonstrated the representativeness \nof their samples. Their response rates varied between \n8 to 95.5%. Most surveys recruited local surveyors and \nprovided them with research training to ensure consist -\nent survey administration to attract community partici -\npation. Some studies that assessed health needs among \nimmigrant communities or minority groups recruited \nbilingual surveyors or/and provided participants with \ntwo versions of the instruments, one in the native lan -\nguage to maximize community engagement [12, 27, \n52, 65, 71, 86, 103]. Surveys that took a participatory \napproach to the design, content, terminology, and lan -\nguage level, were reported more understandable and \nculturally relevant to the community members [52, 65, \n75].\nHealth needs assessment surveys (both concerns surveys \nand health assessment surveys) reported limitations to \ndata collection based on the assessment timing, data avail-\nability, and sample response. As said earlier, using a con -\nvenience sampling and non-representative samples, small \nsample size and inter-rater reliability between surveyors \nwere among some important methodological limitations \nreported by these studies, which limited the generalisabil-\nity of the study findings to the entire community popula -\ntion [35, 57, 65, 71, 74, 75, 77, 96, 106, 116]. Convenience \nsampling method and using community events as sam -\npling sites led to sampling bias in some studies (e.g., an \nover-representation of some specific groups of the popu -\nlation such as women and low –income or high-income \ngroups) [57, 63, 65, 66, 71, 74, 75, 78, 103, 114, 115].\nQualitative studies Among included studies, about 34% \n(n = 39) used qualitative methods as the main source of \ndata collection on community needs and assets. Some of \nthese studies justified the use of qualitative approach by \nexplaining how the overreliance on quantitative, popu -\nlation-level data resulted in CHNAAs failing to identify \nhealth needs and interests of all community members, \nparticularly those of vulnerable population and under -\nrepresented marginalized segments of the community. In \naddition, these studies concluded that integrating qualita-\ntive methods into the CHNAA process has the potential \nto involve community members in a more participatory \nfashion, perhaps improving future collaborations between \ncommunities and service providers. Such collaborations \ncan help to design focused initiatives, making them more \nmeaningful and culturally appropriate [12, 59, 91, 102].\nKey informant interviews, individual interviews with \ncommunity members, focus groups with community \nmembers and community forums were among the quali -\ntative data collection techniques used individually or in \ncombination with each other by these studies to collect \ndata on community needs and assets. They asserted that \nqualitative techniques specifically targeted to underrep -\nresented segments of the population proved to be effec -\ntive mechanisms to explore the participants’ percep -\ntions on issues surrounding community health needs \nand assets. The most used technique to elicit community \nmembers’ opinions were focus group discussions and key \ninformant interviews.\nPage 9 of 20\nRavaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \n \nSmall sample size and single-site setting were men -\ntioned as the most cited limitations of   the  qualita -\ntive CHNAAs that limit these studies generalisability. \nBecause the studied communities were unique com -\nmunities with unique assets, constraints, and health \nneeds, the CHNAA findings cannot be generalised to \nother communities [32, 39, 62, 70, 72, 73, 91, 117, 118]. \nAnother limitation mentioned by some studies was \nthat the demographic composition of the focus group \nparticipants, specifically with regards to race, gender, \nsocio-economic status and age group, did not fully \nreflect the population of studied community as a whole \n[13, 61, 62, 72, 97, 119]. Some studies reported that \nthey could not include all influencing key informants in \nthe community to facilitate broader understandings of \nhealth needs [13, 120].\nMixed‑ methods studies A variety of data collection meth-\nods were used in a number of included studies to ensure \nthat a comprehensive picture of community health needs \nand resources was obtained (n  = 48, 42%). Some of these \nstudies were two-phase explanatory mixed-methods stud-\nies, with the quantitative phase preceding the qualitative \nphase (n = 14, 12%). They conducted targeted focus groups \nor community listening sessions or interview with com -\nmunity members/key informants following needs assess -\nment survey to supplement the findings from the survey \nand provide further information about health status, needs \nof daily living, barrier to health and access to community \nresources [8, 21, 41, 53, 55, 66, 67, 93–95, 99, 113, 114, 121]. \nIn addition to these studies, some studies used triangulation \nmixed-method design to obtain complementary qualita -\ntive and quantitative data on community health needs and \nissues (n = 13, 11%). These studies confirmed that using \nmultiple data sources ensured researchers obtain a com -\nplete picture of  the community health needs. Applying \nqualitative methods in the form of focus groups and semi-\nstructured interviews enabled exploration of problems and \nneeds within their social context and provided a wider per-\nspective on issues raised. However, to conduct such studies \nCHNAA teams had to have members who have qualitative \nand quantitative expertise. There were some limitations spe-\ncific to the mixed-method studies, including lack of rigor \nin integrating qualitative and quantitative findings, relying \nheavily on quantitative data for health need determination, \nand absence of the voices of the communities most in need \n[69, 91].\nData analysis and interpretation\nQualitative data from focus group discussions and key \ninformant interviews were mainly audio-recorded and \ntranscribed verbatim by the research team and all iden -\ntifying information was removed. Different analytical \napproaches, mostly content analysis and thematic analysis, \nwere used to identify main themes related to assets, needs \nand gaps in the service system and priority populations.\nQuantitative data from surveys were analysed using \nstatistical software. Descriptive statistics were used to \ndescribe the sample in terms of socioeconomic back -\nground and present the prevalence of chronic diseases, \nrisk factors, and health behaviours. Statistical analytical \ntests were also used to compare results between differ -\nent groups of community members. Results also were \ncompared by those at the state/ national level or from a \nsimilar community. Those diseases or risk factors that \nhad a high prevalence among community members are \nregarded as priorities that to be addressed further.\nFormulation of recommendations across various levels \n(individual, institution, community, policy levels)\nFollowing analysis of the quantitative and qualitative \ndata, the studies included in the review provided a thor -\nough list of health needs and assets of the community. \nIncluded studies mainly used CHNAA outputs: 1) as a \nresource to provide baseline data of community’s health; \n2) as a resource to prioritize and plan services; 3) as a \nresource for writing grant applications; 4) as a resource to \nguide a comprehensive health promotion strategy.\nNot all included CHNAAs proposed interventions to \naddress identified needs and issues. Some of the included \nstudies (n = 45, 39%) just provided a snapshot of the most \nimportant issues faced by the studied community. They \ndemonstrated several areas where CHNAAs provide \nmore information to researchers, community organi -\nzations, and policy-makers. On the other hand, not all \nidentified issues and needs were addressed by those stud-\nies performed CHNAA in order to implement interven -\ntions or strategies. In practice, specific populations or a \nnumber of specific health conditions or health risks, or \noverarching issues such as health inequality and dispari -\nties were prioritized by these studies.\nIn most cases, decisions on implementation were \ncarried out by the CHNAA steering committees or \nthe research teams. Only a number of studies used a \nclear and explicit set of criteria for deciding the impor -\ntance of each issue [22, 27, 43, 67, 94, 118, 122]. A wide \nrange of criteria were used by included studies such as: \nimpact, urgency, community concern, achievability \nwithin the set time [94], seriousness, urgency, solvabil -\nity, and financial burden of the problems [27], perception \nof survey participants on importance of the identified \nissues and feasibility of intervention, prevalence, fatality, \nsocial and cultural stigma [22], possible interventions, \nPage 10 of 20Ravaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \norganizational capacity, and community assets and \nresources [13], importance and possibility of the effect -\ning change [43], prevalence, impact on the duration of \nsickness, impact on mortality, and the availability of \ntreatment [122], impact of the problem on the overall \nwellness, quality of life, and resources of their community \n[118], factors of health issue, size, seriousness, and effec -\ntiveness of available interventions [101], importance and \nfeasibility [67].\nDifferent techniques for ranking priorities were applied \nby included studies such as: 1) Multi-voting technique \n(decide on priorities by agreeing or disagreeing in group \ndiscussions and continuing process/rounds until a final \nlist is developed), 2) Strategy lists (determine if the \nhealth needs are of “high or low importance” by placing \nemphasis on problems whose solutions have maximum \nimpact, with the possibility of limited resource), 3) Nom -\ninal group technique (rate health problems from 1 to 10 \nthrough group discussion), and 4) Prioritization matrix \n(weigh and rank multiple criteria for prioritization with \nnumeric values to determine health needs with high \nimportance).\nOverall, health priority types were categorized into \nfour main categories by included studies:\n1) Medical conditions (e.g. obesity, diabetes, heart dis -\neases, asthma, mental health disorders, substance \nabuse, vision/ dental problems, HIV/AIDS and sexu -\nally transmitted diseases, injuries and health consul -\ntations).\n2) Health behaviours (e.g. physical activity, eating hab -\nits/ nutrition, tobacco consumption, teen preg -\nnancy and violence/gangs).\n3) Community conditions (e.g. poverty and unemploy -\nment, environmental and infrastructural conditions, \nsuch as air quality/pollution, transportation, access to \nclean water and sanitation, community collaboration, \nand access to healthy food, exercise facilities and \noccupational concerns).\n4) Health systems priorities (e.g. access to care, includ -\ning primary care and higher levels of care, specialty \ncare, mental/ behavioural health care and dental \ncare, quality and acceptability of health services, lack \nof cultural competence in health systems, flexible \nhours and waiting time).\nHowever, guided by a community-based participatory \nresearch (CBPR) approach, a number of studies involved \ncommunity members and stakeholders in priority iden -\ntification or ranking [12, 21–23, 27, 29, 31, 36, 41, 43, 49, \n53, 55, 56, 58–60, 62, 63, 68, 70, 74, 86–88, 90, 92, 99, \n100, 103, 104, 110, 114, 117–119, 121–129], in potential \nstrategy selection [13, 19, 67, 82, 89, 130], and in carrying \nout strategies [8, 37, 69, 81, 93, 105, 113]. They asserted \nthat by involving the perspectives of the relevant stake -\nholders, a comprehensive overview of the issues and pos -\nsible effective solutions was created.\nPlanning of programmes and interventions, implementation \nand evaluation\nThe results of CHNAA were used in various ways \nby included studies. In  some studies, particularly \nresearcher-led studies with limited support or involve -\nment of the local authorities, CHNAA just led to the \nidentification of new, locally relevant issues and pri -\norities without any further actions (n  = 45, 39%). The \nresults of these CHNAAs provided more information to \nresearchers, community organizations, and local policy-\nmakers. Their results also may guide further research \nagenda in the community [18, 21, 23, 29, 35, 39, 40, 42, \n44, 48–50, 52, 54, 55, 62, 64–66, 69–73, 76–78, 85, 96, \n106, 122, 123, 131–135]. Some of these studies tried to \npresent their results to the local authorities through var -\nious channels in the hope that it would modify existing \nprogrammes or implement new ones to meet the needs \nof the community residents. In addition to identifica -\ntion of relevant issues and priorities, included studies \nlisted at least one outcome associated with the reported \nCHNAA activity as follows:\n1) Development or modification of health and social \npolicy and programmes: The knowledge provided by \nCHNAAs helped develop better tailored, and thereby \npotentially more effective interventions by a number \nof studies. Further, the information gathered from \nthe CHNAA process was used as the baseline against \nwhich to measure future targets for assessment \nefforts and progress in areas were targeted (n = 36).\n2) Formation of new partnership: In some cases, a new \npartnership among entities involved in CHNAA was \nformed to address health issues. One of the partner -\nships reported successful was the community–aca -\ndemic partnership in which communities used the \nresearch capacity of academic institutions to conduct \nthe CHNAAs (n = 20). Another type of the partner -\nship reported by some studies was the collaboration \namong healthcare organizations serving the same \ngeographic area to conduct CHNAA jointly. Con -\nducting a joint CHNAA may avoid duplication of \nplanning efforts and obviate the creation of multiple \ncommunity health  needs assessments for the same \npopulation (n = 5).\n3) Development of new recommendations: Several \nsuggestions were proposed to be considered while \ndesigning health improvement interventions in the \nfuture by some of the included studies (n = 18).\nPage 11 of 20\nRavaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \n \n4) Setting or altering strategic direction: Strategic \nagency direction was established or altered in some \ncases, which might indicate that the CHNAA was \nused to redirect resources better to meet the needs of \nthe community (n = 4).\n5) Raising awareness about health issues: One of the \nmost important insights brought by CHNAA find -\nings was the recognition of the health priorities and \ncontributing factors by the community members, \nleaders and researchers, leading to an increased \nawareness of community issues among them (n = 8).\n6) Engaging and motivating policy-makers and stake -\nholders: A few studies reported that CHNAAs pro -\nvided health organizations with the opportunity to \nidentify and interact with key policy-makers, com -\nmunity leaders, and key stakeholders about health \npriorities and concerns, which might foster a sense \nof collective ownership and trust in the results and \nincrease the likelihood that the CHNAA will be \nused (n  = 5).\n7) Having an impact on obtaining resources and \nresource allocation: The CHNAAs provided the com-\nmunity partners with locally relevant information \nregarding the current status of health and perceived \ncommunity needs to inform resource allocation and \napplications for new grants for the initiation of new \nprogrammes (n = 14)\n8) Contribution to the development of CHNAA pro -\ncess: Some studies reported that the specific methods \nused in their CHNAA processes could contribute to \nmore relevant and effective community health need \nassessment process (n = 10).\nDissemination of findings\nDisseminating of the findings and knowledge gained to \nall partners involved was a foremost step of CHNAAs. \nThe most cited product of the CHNAA process in the \nincluded studies was the community needs assessment \nreport. This report includes information about the health \nof the community as well as the community’s capacity to \nimprove the lives of residents. The report provides the \nbasis for discussion and future actions. In addition to \nthe final report, other channels to disseminate CHNAAs \nfindings were reported as: publishing CHNAA main \nresults in local newspapers, communicating research \nresults with community members and stakeholders in \npublic forums or meetings, presentation results to the \nsteering committee and various stakeholders, posting the \nreport on the local authorities websites, individual meet -\nings with community leaders and stakeholders, posters, \nand presentation of findings in academic conferences.\nCommunity participation\nAmong included studies, around 50 studies (44%) \nreported using participatory approaches and tech -\nniques to encourage community members’ participa -\ntion in CHNAA process. Unlike traditional approaches \nto health needs assessment, participatory approaches \naimed to incorporate community inputs at all stages of \nthe research process to enhance capacity building and \novercome barriers to research raised by matters of trust, \ncommunication, cultural differences, power and rep -\nresentation. A variety of participatory approaches (e.g. \ncommunity based participatory research (CBPR), par -\nticipatory rural appraisal, participatory action research \n(PAR), rapid participatory appraisal (RPA), tribal partici -\npatory research, community-based collaborative action \nresearch (CBCAR), precede-proceed model, concept \nmapping and photovoice) were used by these studies to \nensure that communities participate in CHNAA, from \ndefining the community to identifying needs and assets \nand developing new interventions.\nPennel and colleagues classified the depth of the com -\nmunity participation in CHNAA activities into four main \ncategories [136]. In this classification, depth of the com -\nmunity participation was assessed by the types of activi -\nties in which participants were involved throughout the \nassessment and planning process as follows:\n1. No participation: No attempt to engage community \nstakeholders or members;\n2. Consultation-only: Engagement of health-related \nstakeholders, broader community stakeholders, and/\nor community members to identify health needs \nthrough surveys, interviews, and/or focus groups; \nverified or validated health needs/priorities with \nlocal experts;\n3. Moderate participation: Involvement of community \nstakeholders/ or community members in priority \nidentification; involvement of community stakehold -\ners in strategy selection;\n4. Extensive participation: Involvement of community \nstakeholders/or community members to develop and \ncarry out strategies.\nThe above classification was used to assess the depth of \nthe community participation by included studies. Based \non the content analysis, community participation in \nCHNAA process varied considerably across the included \nempirical studies, from minimal to in-depth participa -\ntion (Table 1). Around 65% of the included studies were \ninvolved in consultation-only to identify health needs \nthrough one-way communication using tools such as sur-\nveys, interviews, and focus group to identify community \nneeds and resources. Around 22% of the included studies \nPage 12 of 20Ravaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \nsolicited moderate participation from the community by \ninvolving community in verifying needs and final prior -\nity selection and only about 10% of the included stud -\nies reported a broad and deep community participation \nincluding community involvement in designing and \nimplementing strategies to improve community health.\nChallenges\nThree categories of challenges were cited by the reviewed \nstudies while performing CHNAA projects.\n1) Methodological challenges: These are mainly asso -\nciated with quantitative and qualitative data collec -\ntion methods, which were discussed earlier. Other \nmethodological challenges cited were: difficulties in \naggregating and making sense of data collected from \nvarious sources (triangulation), non-generalisabil -\nity of site-specific data and limitations of the use of \nexisting epidemiological data alone, which does not \nprovide a comprehensive view of health needs, yet \nis often the most available source of information. \nTraditional approaches to data collection were chal -\nlenging where language and literacy barriers existed \n[12, 52, 65, 71]. Another major challenge reported \nby studies used community-based participatory \nresearch approaches was the challenge of involv -\ning the community in decisions related to research \ndesign and data collection methods while maintain -\ning an appropriate level of methodological validity \nand reliability [56, 81, 121]. In addition, participation \nwas not without challenges. Including the perspec -\ntives of stakeholders and residents can lead to differ -\ning accounts of what services are seen as essential, \nand each party may push their own agenda based \non their personal or professional interests. Further, \nlinguistic and cultural barriers may be a major fac -\ntor among minority groups hindering participation \nin such endeavors [81, 137].\n2) Logistical challenges: The major logistical challenges \nreported were the need for a considerable amount \nof time (often inadequate), and resources required \nto conduct a comprehensive assessment [80, 138]. \nGood quality local data on the needs and utiliza -\ntion of health services are usually difficult to obtain \n[9]. Financial costs are considerable and the depth of \ninformation obtained will ultimately depend upon \nthe methods employed [139, 140]. In addition, health \nTable 1 Depth of participation by assessment and planning activity type\n\nPage 13 of 20\nRavaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \n \nprofessionals, managers and others involved in health \nservices planning and delivery may not have the req -\nuisite skills to conduct CHNAAs. This goes beyond \ntechnical skills and places an emphasis on soft skills \nand flexibility including good listening skills, the abil-\nity to establish trusting relationships, empathy, work-\ning with diverse groups and reflexivity [140, 141]. \nMoreover, limited health information infrastructure \nand systems in developing countries settings may \nhave hindered the availability of good quality infor -\nmation to conduct CHNAAs [13, 28, 30, 142].\n3) Ethical challenges: Concerns were raised about the \nethical issues associated with community consul -\ntation about felt needs followed by priority setting \nprocess that leaves many needs unaddressed and the \nbulk of expectations dashed. Labelling, stigma and \nstereo- typing are other problems raised by needs \nassessment [143]. Needs assessment results may \nnot be utilised, leaving unmet expectations and may \nrequire extensive financial and political support to \nlead to changes in health service planning and deliv -\nery [9]. Comprehensive health needs assessment \nis likely to produce different, potentially conflict -\ning needs, exposing hidden conflicts and tensions in \ncommunities without any mechanisms to address \nthese issues [5]. Further, local participation may only \nallow those who are able to voice their needs to do \nso, leaving behind the silent or hidden voices [81]. \nInvolvement of the community in the needs assess -\nment process also impacts upon possible outcomes \nof the project especially since it is likely that expecta -\ntions of changes to programmes and service delivery \nmay have arisen from local participation [144].\nFacilitators and enablers\nCHNAA projects need to be organized in such a way that \nthey have clear objectives, and are adequately resourced \nby experienced staff. In addition, factors such as clear \nobjectives, decisive leadership, teamwork, communica -\ntion, sound study design, adequate resourcing, skilled \nstaff, sufficient time and ownership by stakeholders \nare among those factors that contribute to the success -\nful implementation of CHNAAs [15, 145]. Most studies \ncited community participation as a major facilitator of \nthe CHNAA process and outcomes. Participation was \nshown to foster bidirectional learning and communica -\ntions, where both health authorities and the community \nlearnt about needs and priorities. Different benefits for \ncommunity engagement were mentioned by reviewed \nliterature including, improved participants’ recruit -\nment, enhanced capacity among stakeholders, productive \nconflict resolution, increased quality of outputs and out -\ncomes, increased sustainability of project goals beyond \nfunding and timelines and development of linguistically \nand culturally appropriate measures. In addition, incor -\nporating community voices has the potential to inform \nthe development of sound measures to tackle health dis -\nparities in the basis of race, social class and ethnicity [12, \n27, 30, 91, 103, 110, 126, 146].\nDiscussion\nThe main objective of our scoping review was to pro -\nvide an overview of why and how community health \nneeds and assets assessments (CHNAAs) have been \nused globally. Substantial variation was found among \nthe studies reviewed concerning definitions, process, \nparticipants, methods, goals, and products, yet there \nwere many common characteristics.\nSome CHNAAs focused narrowly on health care in \nassessing needs, with scant attention to other commu -\nnity issues that can affect health. However, most of the \nincluded studies looked beyond health needs and con -\nsidered social and environmental conditions influenc -\ning community health. We argue all CHNAAs should \napproach community health needs assessment holisti -\ncally, focusing on both individual physical and mental \nwellbeing as well as casting a social determinants of \nhealth lens on the population health.\nThe review showed that community health needs \nassessment is used widely by different users and across \ndifferent settings in both HICs and LMICs. However, \nin countries such as the US it has become institution -\nalized and has accordingly been developed, as service \nproviders, particularly hospitals, are mandated to per -\nform CHNAA to compliance with legislative man -\ndates. However, though federal and state laws impose \nrequirements on hospitals to conduct CHNAAs, the \nmethods for needs assessments are generally left to the \ndiscretion of each hospital [147]. As a result, assess -\nment methods vary widely. US-based CHNAAs either \ndevelop their own CHNAA processes or utilize a pro -\ncess developed at the state or national level to guide \ntheir efforts. A number of toolkits have been provided \nby different organizations across US to help health -\ncare providers to conduct CHNAA  projects [6 , 148, \n149]. This highlights the need for consensus guidance \nacross many countries and settings while maintain -\ning the responsiveness to contextual needs, assets and \npriorities.\nBoth qualitative and quantitative approaches were \nemployed to collect data on community health needs and \nassets. Overall, there has been a growing use of mixed-\nmethods approaches to conduct CHNAA in recent years, \nPage 14 of 20Ravaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \nowing to the recognition in the literature that using quali-\ntative and quantitative approaches simultaneously can \nprovide complementary insights determining community \nhealth needs and assets [69, 91, 104]. Although quantita-\ntive approaches yield concrete evidence of community \nneeds and assets, qualitative approaches provide a con -\ntext for how these issues can be addressed using available \nresources [91, 102]. Using qualitative methods in conjunc-\ntion with more traditional quantitative approaches is espe-\ncially appropriate for studying complex public health issues \nand promotes the alignment of implementation plans with \nthe local needs of community members [59, 69, 91]. The \ngrowing use of mixed-methods  approaches has practi -\ncal implications for research training and capacity build -\ning within entities performing CHNAAs. Organizations \nwho wish to conduct CHNAAs will need to ensure that \nthe competencies and expertise required for mixed-meth-\nods studies are available.\nAlthough only a small number of studies provided \ndefinitions of assets, there is a growing interest in the lit -\nerature in asset-based assessment, which examines and \nmobilizes community assets, instead of focusing on only \nthe needs of communities [11, 84]. Unlike need-based \nor deficit approaches, asset-based approaches docu -\nment resources and focus on strengths to enhance and \npreserve rather than deficits to be remedied. Related to \nprinciples of empowerment, it postulates that solutions \nto community problems already exist within a communi -\nty’s assets. By recognizing existing capacity, communities \ncan become empowered to take ownership of their health \nand improve as a population [11, 31, 125]. An asset-based \napproach was recognized as essential for enhancing \ntrust and community coalitions [83]. Further, it is more \nparticipatory in nature through involving community \nstakeholders throughout the needs assessment process \n[82, 83]. In particular, it highlights community resilience, \nresources, and opportunities for positive growth rather \nthan focusing solely on health problems or other con -\ncerns [14, 84, 88]. In developing countries, assets identi -\nfied from within the community are crucial for later use \nin the implementation of health programmes. The shift \nfrom a traditional needs-based perspective to an asset-\nbased perspective to health needs assessment can help \nto address resource constraints in these countries [13, 30, \n150].\nThere was a growing interest in the use of participa -\ntory approaches and in their value in identifying and \naddressing community health needs over recent years \namong included studies. About half of the reviewed \nstudies applied CBPR or other community-engaged \napproaches to perform CHNAA. There are several \nopportunities to fully engage patients, families, and com -\nmunities in healthcare delivery redesign to ensure that \nthey are provided in a way that address the community \nmembers’ needs and preferences. The CHNAA process \nis one mechanism for this engagement—and a good pre -\ncursor to deeper engagement and collaboration [91, 97, \n123]. Integrating community voices into CHNAA pro -\ncess may be crucially important for confronting health \ndisparities at the community level, which stemming \nfrom socio-historical processes, including racial and eth -\nnic discrimination and economic inequality [33, 74, 86, \n91]. To eliminate health disparities, it is critical first to \nunderstand social, cultural, and economic determinants \nof health. CHNAAs, particularly when they include the \nvoices of community residents, can provide an opportu -\nnity to understand local processes contributing to health \ndisparities. This knowledge can then be used to inform \nhealth and equity initiatives [91, 110, 126]. The develop -\nment process and implementation of a CHNAA  pro -\nject is an important example of evidence-based public \nhealth practice. It is a way to address health and health \ncare disparities experienced by medically underserved \npopulations [86, 92, 126]. Those studies used a participa -\ntory approach reported that by having community par -\nticipation, concerns and issues of the most marginalized \nand vulnerable populations were voiced. The inclusion \nof these voices allowed for a broader and deeper under -\nstanding of the concerns of those who are typically mar -\nginalized and that may be missed in traditional health \nneeds assessment methodologies [33, 56, 58, 74, 86, 110, \n137, 146]. Hence, defining communities while performing \nCHNAA needs to be dynamic and socially constructed \nto take into account all voices and members especially \nthose not ordinarily included. This deeper understand -\ning is critical to move public health practice and research \nupstream to address structural and social determinants of \nhealth necessary for population-level reductions in health \ninequities [80, 91].\nAlthough there is widespread theoretical recognition \nof the importance of in-depth community participation \nin CHNAA, this has not been fully embraced in prac -\ntice based on our review. Included studies reported \ncommunity involvement in various stages of CHNAA \nwith varying depth reflecting a continuum from no \nparticipation to extensive participation, in which most \nstudies were located at the middle of the participation \ncontinuum. The literature review suggests while certain \ncommunity stakeholders were engaged in the CHNAA \nprocess, most studies did not involve a broad range \nof stakeholders through adopting a full participation \napproach. One reason for this could be that for most \nstudies conducted in the US, CHNAA was performed \nto comply with ACA requirements, which requires hos -\npitals to incorporate inputs of the population served as \npart of the CHNAA process. Since community inputs \nPage 15 of 20\nRavaghi et al. BMC Health Services Research           (2023) 23:44 \n \nas well as the process as a whole is not well-defined \nby these regulations [20], it seems that the majority \nof included US-based studies tried to meet legislative \nrequirements by incorporating a minimum level of \ncommunity and stakeholders’ participation in CHNAA \nprocess. In addition, the concept of community engage -\nment in health services planning and implementation \nhas evolved over recent years, from one-way consul -\ntative processes to bi-directional collaboration and \nshared leadership. Although undertaking an in-depth \nparticipatory approach through extensive participa -\ntion of community stakeholders in CHNAAs may pose \ncertain challenges for healthcare providers including \nrequiring additional time and other resources to col -\nlaborate with community residents, we argue the ben -\nefits to this approach are important to improve health, \nas reported by some included studies [80, 118, 151].\nA notable gap in the existing literature is the lack of \nlong-term or longitudinal–assessment of CHNAA. The \nreview showed that additional research into CHNAA \nimplementation and outcomes is needed. Currently, \nthere are limited data describing the impact of CHNAAs \non health outcomes. However, there is ample evidence \non different short-term impacts associated with CHNAA \nimplementation, including, the development of health \nand social interventions, forming the new partnership, \nraising awareness on health issues, engaging policy-\nmakers, and facilitating obtaining resources. In other \nwords, it is unclear how CHNAA projects are linked \ndirectly to health outcomes. Furthermore, the mecha -\nnisms between the conduct and use of CHNAA remain \nlargely unknown in the literature [152, 153]. Clearly, not \nall CHNAA projects result in changes to policies or pro -\ngrammes, and conversely, many programme and policy \ndecisions are made in the absence of CHNAA data [154, \n155]. Still, further research to understand these mecha -\nnisms and the long term impact of CHNAA is needed to \nsupport evidence of its use and value in addressing indi -\nvidual and population health needs.\nConclusion\nThis scoping review aimed to provide clarity and sup -\nplement the evidence on the key concepts, rationale, \nmethods, tools and outcomes of community health \nneeds and assets assessments (CHNAAs). Importantly, \nit highlights the need for holistic approaches to needs \nassessments to focus on physical, mental and social \nwellbeing, along with considering wider systems fac -\ntors and structural challenges to individual and popu -\nlation health. Furthermore, the findings emphasize the \ninclusion of community assets in community health \nassessments, beginning foremost with community \ncapabilities and knowledge. It is encouraging to see \nthe use of pragmatic approaches including both quali -\ntative and quantitative methods in CHNAA process \nin the literature. This will help to ensure that a robust \nand in-depth exploration of needs and assets is avail -\nable to guide decision making. Although we recognize \nthe challenges with providing consensus on definitions, \nprocesses and tools for CHNAA, we argue that more \nclarity is needed on the key considerations, steps and \noutcomes for this process across various settings. This \nstudy attempts to provide some theoretical insights and \nempirical information concerning the process, which \nhopefully will provide useful guidance to community \norganizations, policy- makers, health service provid -\ners and researchers seeking to develop and implement \ncommunity health needs and assets assessment.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. \norg/ 10. 1186/ s12913‑ 022‑ 08983‑3.\nAdditional file 1.
