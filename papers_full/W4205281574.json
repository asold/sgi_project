  "abstract": "In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation, conventional approaches utilize U-Net models with encoder窶電ecoder structures, segmentation models using vision transformers, or models that combine a vision transformer with an encoder窶電ecoder model structure. However, conventional models have large sizes and slow computation speed and, in vision transformer models, the computation amount sharply increases with the image size. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a model that combines Swin transformer blocks and a lightweight U-Net type model that has an HarDNet blocks-based encoder窶電ecoder structure. To maintain the features of the hierarchical transformer and shifted-windows approach of the Swin transformer model, the Swin transformer is used in the first skip connection layer of the encoder instead of in the encoder窶電ecoder bottleneck. The proposed model, called STHarDNet, was evaluated by separating the anatomical tracings of lesions after stroke (ATLAS) dataset, which comprises 229 T1-weighted MRI images, into training and validation datasets. It achieved Dice, IoU, precision, and recall values of 0.5547, 0.4185, 0.6764, and 0.5286, respectively, which are better than those of the state-of-the-art models U-Net, SegNet, PSPNet, FCHarDNet, TransHarDNet, Swin Transformer, Swin UNet, X-Net, and D-UNet. Thus, STHarDNet improves the accuracy and speed of MRI image-based stroke diagnosis.",
