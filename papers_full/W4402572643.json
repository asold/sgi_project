  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe how autistic TikTok creators are using ChatGPT across various domains of their lives, their motivations for doing so, and resulting impacts. Using a framework of “disability expertise,” we document the knowledge that creators acquired through use of ChatGPT and then shared with peers via social media. We used deductive qualitative methods to analyze 25 TikTok videos from 25 unique creators. Themes were identified in connection with motivations for the use of ChatGPT, settings in which it was used, applications of this technology, and resulting impacts for creators. Findings indicate that autistic creators were motivated to use ChatGPT to navigate neurotypical environments, manage features of their neurodivergence, and unmask, with the technology often serving as a digital coach, communication assistant, and conversational partner. Use of ChatGPT resulted in harm reduction, time and energy savings, positive emotional experiences, and meaningful accomplishments in both personal and professional settings. These findings indicate that ChatGPT serves as an important resource for many autistic individuals, facilitating accommodations to often inaccessible environments and helping users manage stressors and pursue goals. The study also highlights the significance of social media platforms for disseminating disability expertise related to the use of large language models to improve quality of life.",
