    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a highly sensitive gas detection system based on a resonant photoacoustic cell for detecting dissolved gases in transformer oil. A simulation model of the resonant photoacoustic cell was studied and optimized the buffer chamber volume while ensuring signal enhancement. The volume of the photoacoustic cell was reduced by about 80% compared to the classical model. A resonant photoacoustic cell was then fabricated based on the optimized simulation optimization. The dual-resonance photoacoustic system was constructed by combining the resonant PA cell with a handmade cantilever fiber acoustic sensor. The system’s sensitivity was further improved by using an erbium-doped fiber amplifier, wavelength modulation, and harmonic detection technology. The experimental results showed that the system achieved a detection limit of 6 ppb and an excellent linear range under 1000 ppm for C2H2 gas. The developed gas detection system has potential applications for monitoring the condition of power transformers in power grids.",
