    "abstract": "It is found that a piezoelectric plate can serve as an excellent inductive component between its resonant and anti‐resonant frequencies. To compensate for the capacitance of a piezoelectric transformer (PT) at resonance, three piezoelectric plates with different inductances are chosen to match the PT in different exciting power. Experiments demonstrate that a piezoelectric ceramic can mimic an inductor effectively. Compared with the wirewound inductor, the mimic inductor made of piezoelectric ceramic can achieve a better compensation in a large power range to guarantee inductive impedance phase for the PT. With the excellent advantages in terms of compensation, cost and fabrication, ceramic inductor has potential use in PT‐based converter of high integration and efficiency without the need for conventional wirewound inductors.",
