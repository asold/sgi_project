    "abstract": "&lt;abstract&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clinical event detection (CED) is a hot topic and essential task in medical artificial intelligence, which has attracted the attention from academia and industry over the recent years. However, most studies focus on English clinical narratives. Owing to the limitation of annotated Chinese medical corpus, there is a lack of relevant research about Chinese clinical narratives. The existing methods ignore the importance of contextual information in semantic understanding. Therefore, it is urgent to research multilingual clinical event detection. In this paper, we present a novel encoder-decoder structure based on pre-trained language model for Chinese CED task, which integrates contextual representations into Chinese character embeddings to assist model in semantic understanding. Compared with existing methods, our proposed strategy can help model harvest a language inferential skill. Besides, we introduce the punitive weight to adjust the proportion of loss on each category for coping with class imbalance problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct a range of experiments on test set of our manually annotated corpus. We compare overall performance of our proposed model with baseline models on our manually annotated corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves the best precision of 83.73%, recall of 86.56% and F1-score of 85.12%. Moreover, we also evaluate the performance of our proposed model with baseline models on minority category samples. We discover that our proposed model obtains a significant increase on minority category samples.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/abstract&gt;",
