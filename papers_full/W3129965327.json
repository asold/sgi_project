Percentage differential relays operate\nwhen the differential current measured at the transformer termi-\nnals exceeds a predeﬁned percentage of the restraint current. Al-\nthough differential relays are commonly used, they must present\na suitable adjustment to take into account the transformer tap\nchanger, errors due to CT saturation, transformer overexcitation,\nand inrush currents.\nAiming to improve the conventional percentage differential\nrelays, additional harmonic restraint and harmonic blocking\nmethods have been used [4], [5]. Although those methods\nprovide security, the internal fault detection can be delayed\ndue to the digital ﬁltering process to compute harmonic com-\nponents. Furthermore, these methods may fail during inrush\nconditions because the second harmonic content may be smaller\nthan established thresholds, causing relay misoperation [6].\nBesides harmonic-based functions, a negative sequence unit is\nalso commonly used for detecting unbalanced internal faults,\nsuch as turn-to-turn and turn-to-ground faults. However, this\nunit is usually blocked during external faults and transformer\nenergizations [7].\nSeveral techniques based on artiﬁcial intelligence, digital\nsignal processing, and probability theory and statistics have\nbeen developed in order to improve the efﬁciency of transformer\ndifferential protection schemes [8]–[11]. For instance, in [8] a\nmethod based on the Clarke transform and fuzzy logic to single\nout internal faults on power transformers is presented. Clarke\ntransform was applied on instantaneous values of differential\ncurrents, which eliminated the need of a phasor estimation\nalgorithm and reduced the computational burden. However, the\nmethod did not ensure the protection for turn-to-ground faults\nbetween the ﬁrst 5% and the neutral point of the wye-connected\nwinding. Furthermore, the performance of the method was not\nassessed for CT saturation.\nResearch reported in [9] and [11] used high-order statistics\nand the second central moment techniques to distinguish be-\ntween internal faults and energizations, respectively. Both meth-\nods presented good success rates in the event discrimination, but\nonly [11] reported adjusts with no dependence of the transformer\nand system parameters. However, these methods did not consider\ntransformer overexcitation, which is an important situation for\nvalidating new power transformer protections.\nThe wavelet transform has been widely employed to as-\nsist power transformer differential protection [10], [12]–[15].\nIn [13], using the real-time boundary stationary wavelet\n0885-8977 © 2021 IEEE.

Instead of the phasor-based conventional\ndifferential protection, this method uses only high-frequency\ncomponents of CT secondary currents. Hence, neither funda-\nmental nor low-order harmonic components are necessary. This\nmethod presented: simplicity of implementation, fast operation,\ngood accuracy, and low computational burden. However, the\nmethod described in [13] is affected by CT saturation, evolving\nexternal-to-internal faults, and transformer energization with or\nfollowed by faults. Therefore, the method presented in [13] was\nupdated in [14] and [15] with additional functions to overcome\nthese issues. Considering these three references [13]–[15], the\nperformance assessment included general and challenging cases\nfor the transformer differential protection, such as external faults\nwith and without CT saturation, evolving external-to-internal\nfaults, transformer energization followed by internal faults, sym-\npathetic energizations, and several types of internal faults con-\nsidering few percentage of the winding. The 87TW and 87QW\nunits proposed in [13]–[15], which are segregated by phase,\nprovided a better performance and a faster fault detection than\nthe respective conventional ones. However, the performance of\nthese wavelet-based methods was assessed only in a simulation\nenvironment and, therefore, with no validation by using actual\nrecords. Furthermore, the negative sequence unit was blocked\nduring external faults, and the performance of these methods\nwas not assessed for transformer overexcitations.\nThis paper proposes a power transformer differential protec-\ntion by using both Clarke and wavelet transforms, named as\n87TWα, which extracts high-frequency transients induced by\nfaults to provide a fast operation in accordance with the time-\ndomain operation instead of the phasor-based idea. While [13]–\n[15] use positive and negative units segregated by phase and\nadditional inrush and CT saturation detection methods, the\nproposed method presents only the 87TW αunit, with no phase\nsegregation. In addition, all equations present only addition and\nmultiplication operations, and were designed to run in a real-time\nprocessing. Although the proposed method presents only one\ndifferential unit, it presents an automatic parameter setting to be\nused in any power transformer interchangebly. Furthermore, the\nproposed 87TW α unit can be used in power transformers with\nany number of windings.\nA differential protection based on high-frequency transients\ninduced by faults, such as proposed in this paper, requires\ncurrents in both transformer terminals sampled at a high rate\ncompared to sampling frequencies used by conventional pro-\ntective relays. Therefore, actual data to validate these methods\nare not readily available. Nevertheless, the proposed method\nwas validated with actual records from a power transformer\nin an actual transmission power system, containing internal\nfault, external fault, external fault clearance, and transformer\nenergization, where the actual relay failed in the last one.\nMoreover, the proposed method was further assessed by us-\ning representative simulations of internal faults, external faults\nwith and without CT saturation, evolving external-to-internal\nfaults, transformer overexcitations, transformer energizations,\nFig. 1.

The results revealed the\nproposed method was accurate, fast, and simple.

RT-BSWT (Block 2)\nThe scaling and wavelet coefﬁcients of the RT-BSWT are\nrespectively given by [16]:\nsΦ(l,k)= 1√\n2\nL−1∑\nn=0\nhϕ(n)\n◦\niΦ(k −L+n+1+ l), (1)\nwΦ(l,k)= 1√\n2\nL−1∑\nn=0\nhψ(n)\n◦\niΦ(k −L+n+1+ l), (2)\nwhere k ⩾ Δk −1 is always associated to the current sample\ntime k/fs, in which fs is the sampling frequency; 0 ⩽ l<L is\nthe border index; hϕ and hψ are low-pass scaling and high-pass\nwavelet ﬁlters, respectively; L is the ﬁlter length; Δk ⩾ L is\nthe sliding window length;\n◦\niΦ(k +m)= iΦ(k −Δk +m)with\nm ∈ N∗, which is a periodized current in Δk samples; sΦ =\n{sN\nA, sN\nB, sN\nC } and wΦ = {wN\nA , wN\nB , wN\nC } are related to iΦ =\n{iN\nA, iN\nB, and iN\nC }.\nC. The Clarke Transform (Block 3)\nThis paper proposes the application of the Clarke transform\nin the instantaneous boundary wavelet coefﬁcients in order to\ncompute the alpha-mode (α-mode) wavelet coefﬁcients (Clarke-\nwavelet coefﬁcients), as follows:\n⎡\n⎢⎢⎣\nwN\nαA(k)\nwN\nαB(k)\nwN\nαC(k)\n⎤\n⎥⎥⎦ =\n√\n2\n3\n⎡\n⎢⎢⎢⎣\n1 −1\n2 −1\n2\n−1\n2 1 −1\n2\n−1\n2 −1\n2 1\n⎤\n⎥⎥⎥⎦\n⎡\n⎢⎢⎣\nwN\nA (k)\nwN\nB (k)\nwN\nC (k)\n⎤\n⎥⎥⎦, (3)\nwhere wN\nφ ={wN\nαA, wN\nαB, and wN\nαC} are the respective α-mode\nwavelet coefﬁcients related to the primary transformer winding\ncurrents iN\nABC = {iN\nA, iN\nB, iN\nC }; φ = {αA, αB, αC}.\nD. Phase/Magnitude Adjustments (Block 4)\nThe magnitude, phase shift, and zero-sequence correction are\nperformed on the α-mode wavelet coefﬁcients as follows:\n⎡\n⎢⎣\nwN\nαA\nwN\nαB\nwN\nαC\n⎤\n⎥⎦ = 1\nTAPN\nMN\n⎡\n⎢⎣\nwN\nαA\nwN\nαB\nwN\nαC\n⎤\n⎥⎦, (4)\nwhere wN\nφ = {wN\nαA, wN\nαB, and wN\nαC}; TAPN is the tap of the\nCT; and MN is the matrix used for the transformer angular\ndisplacement [17], [18].\nE. Differential Wavelet Coefﬁcients (Block 5)\nBased on the classical differential currents [19], this paper\nproposes the differential Clarke-wavelet coefﬁcients instead of\ndifferential currents. The differential α-mode wavelet coefﬁ-\ncients are given by:\nwop\nφ (0,k)=\nN∑\nm=1\n1\n2wm\nφ (0,k), (5)\nwop\nφ (l ̸=0 ,k)=\nN∑\nm=1\nwm\nφ (l,k), (6)\nwhere 0 ≤ l<L ; wop\nφ = {wop\nαA, wop\nαB, wop\nαC}; m is the counter\nfor the number of windings; and the superscript op refers to\noperation Clarke-wavelet coefﬁcients.\nF . Differential Energy and the Automatic\nThreshold Deﬁnition (Block 6)\nBased on [16], this paper proposes the differential Clarke-\nmode wavelet coefﬁcient energies, named as differential Clarke-\nmode energies ( Ediff\nφ = {Eop\nφ , Eres\nφ }), where:\nEop\nφ (k)=\nL−1∑\nl=1\n[wop\nφ (l,k)]2 +\nk∑\nn=k−Δk+L\n[wop\nφ (0,n)]2, (7)\nand\nEres\nφ (k)=\nN∑\nm=1\nEm\nφ (k), (8)\nwhere 0 ≤ l<L ; Eop\nφ = {Eop\nαA, Eop\nαB, Eop\nαC}; and Em\nφ (k) is the\nwavelet coefﬁcient energy of the current of the mth winding,\nbeing computed in the same way as Eop\nφ .\nThe αA-, αB-, and αC-modes are combined into just one\nα-mode energy as follows:\nEop\nα (k)= Eop\nαA(k)+ Eop\nαB(k)+ Eop\nαC(k), (9)\nEres\nα (k)= Eres\nαA(k)+ Eres\nαB(k)+ Eres\nαC (k). (10)\nTherefore, α-mode protection is not segregated by phase, and\nthis block returns only two differential energy variables: Ediff\nα\n= {Eop\nα , Eres\nα }.\nThe threshold related to the energy Ediff\nα is automatic deﬁned\nas follows:\nEdiff\nα = P\nk2 −k1 +1\nk2∑\nn=k1\nEdiff\nα (n), (11)\nwhere [k1/fs k2/fs] is a previous steady-state time range and P\n=5. These thresholds are essential for detecting events after the\nsteady-state, such as internal faults, external faults, and trans-\nformer energization maneuvers, and are automatically deﬁned\nto a speciﬁc power transformer based on the noise statistic.\nG. Scaling Coefﬁcient Energy (Block 7)\nConversely to the wavelet coefﬁcient energy, the scaling co-\nefﬁcient energy of the currents are directly proportional to low-\nfrequency components, which is ideal to identify null-currents\nbefore transformer energization. Based on [16], the scaling\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Delft Library. Downloaded on February 02,2022 at 07:36:25 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Settings for Inrush Currents (Block 8)\nThe transformer can be identiﬁed as opened when currents are\nlower than pickup values, which is accomplished in the wavelet\ndomain as follows:\nEΦ(k) <E Φ, (13)\nwhere EΦ are thresholds related to EΦ.\nWhen (13) is fulﬁlled, the method automatically sets the\n87TWα unit slope to Kα = 0.9, sets the trip delay to Nα =\n3\n4Δk, and generates the pre-energizaton ﬂag. The slope Kα\nand the trip delay Nα are updated to make the protection more\nsecure during transformer energizations without sacriﬁcing its\nreliability in detecting internal faults during inrush currents.\nThen, the 87TW αunit will be able to recognize if the next event\nwill be related to an inrush current with or without a permanent\ninternal fault.\nI. Inception Time Detection of External Events (Block 9)\nAccording to the power transformer differential protection\ntheory, the ratio Iop/Ires tends to remain lower than the slope in\nexternal events to the power transformer protection zone, such\nas external faults, transformer overexcitations and sympathetic\ninrush conditions, avoiding possible relay misoperations [20],\nwhere Ires and Iop are operating and restraining currents at the\nfundamental frequency (low-frequency components). Based on\nthis premise, but using high-frequency components extracted\nwith Clarke-wavelet differential energy, external events are de-\ntected if:\nEop\nα (k) <K αEres\nα (k) (14)\nand ⎧\n⎨\n⎩\nEop\nα (k −1) <E op\nα\nEres\nα (k −1) <E res\nα\nEres\nα (k) >E res\nα\n(15)\nwhere kEF /fs = k/fs is the detected external fault inception\ntime when both (14) and (15) are fulﬁlled.\nWhen both (14) and (15) are met, the method sets Kα = 0.5\nand Nα = 1\n2Δk, automatically. Then, the 87TW α unit will be\nable to properly detect possible internal faults after external ones\n(evolving external-to-internal fault), as well as CT and power\ntransformer saturations in external events.\nJ. Differential Protection Units (Block 10)\nBased on the classical differential principle, the proposed\n87TWα unit detects an internal fault when:{Eop\nα (k) >K αEres\nα (k)\nEop\nα (k) >E op\nα\n. (16)\nFig. 2. Trajectory of the energy operating points for the most of events.\nThe default slope is Kα =0.5. However, it can change according\nto Sections II-H and II-I.\nWhen a pre-energization ﬂag is generated and (16) is fulﬁlled,\nthe algorithm identiﬁes the beginning of a transformer energiza-\ntion and the threshold Eop\nα is then updated along the time in\norder to provide security during the occurrence of this event, as\nfollows:\nEop\nα = MEop\nα (k), if Eop\nα (k) > Eop\nα (k −1), (17)\nwhere M =0.01 and Eop\nα =0 at the beginning of the energiza-\ntion.\nThe inception time of the internal fault ( kIF /fs) is identiﬁed\nwhen (16) is true and when\n{Eop\nα (k −1) <E op\nα\nEres\nα (k −1) <E res\nα\n(18)\nis also true, where kIF /fs = k/fs.\nWhen (16) is true, the α-mode energy Ediff\nα is in the operation\nregion and the trip command of the 87TW αunit is high ( Tα(k)\n= 1), otherwise Ediff\nα is in the restraining region and Tα(k)=\n0.\nK. Trip Management (Block 11)\nWhen the α-mode energy point is in the restraining region,\nthen Tα(k)= 0. Therefore, the operator 3Tα-2=-2, which\nproduces a decrease by 2 in the trip counter ΣTα(k), where\nΣTα(k) ≥ 0. Conversely, when the α-mode energy point is in\nthe operating region, then Tα(k)=1. As a consequence, 3Tα-\n2=1, which produces an increase in the trip counter ΣTα(k).\nThereafter, ΣTα(k) is compared to the related trip delay Nα,\nwhere the relay trips when ΣTα(k) > Nα (Fig. 1).\nThe default trip delay Nα is zero.

P ERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT WITH ACTUAL DATA\nThis section presents a thorough discussion about the perfor-\nmance of an existing protection system used in an actual power\ntransformer of a transmission system under internal fault, exter-\nnal fault, external fault clearance, and transformer energization\nas well as the performance of the proposed method.\nA. Power System Description\nFig. 3 depicts the simpliﬁed single-line diagram of two actual\npower transformers of a power system where disturbances were\nrecorded. The power system is represented by two equivalent\nsources (S1 and S2) for the sake of simplicity. T1 and T2 are\n100 MV A, 230/69 kV power transformers conﬁgured at YNd1.\nThe 230 kV and 69 kV CTs are connected at 500/5 A and\n1200/5 A taps, respectively. Details about the system parameters\nare described in [15].\nThe traditional phasor-based 87 T function was used to pro-\ntect the power transformer in the ﬁeld. Nevertheless, a digital\nfault recorder (DFR) monitored the power transformers with\na sampling frequency of 15360 Hz (256 samples per cycle of\n60 Hz), where both currents and voltages at the high-voltage\nFig. 4. Currents measurement in the transformer T1: (a) iH\nA, iH\nB,a n d iH\nC ;\n(b) iX\nA , iX\nB,a n d iX\nC ;( c ) α-mode operating and restraining energies; (d) logic\nstates for both circuit breakers and the differential relay which protects T1.\nside (230 kV) as well as currents at the low-voltage side (69 kV)\nwere measured as data records.\nThe proposed wavelet-based differential protection was as-\nsessed in an off-line analysis with the oscillographic records pro-\nvided by the DFR at 15360 Hz. The proposed method runs with\nthe Daubechies mother wavelet with four coefﬁcients (db(4)).\nB. Internal Fault\nA double-line fault between phases B and C took place at the\nterminals of the monitored transformer T1. Therefore, it is an\ninternal fault to the differential protection in T1. Fig. 4 depicts\nthe currents measured in T1, the differential α-mode differential\nenergies, and the digital status of the circuit breakers (T1/CB)\nand the differential protections (T1/87 T and T1/87TW α). The\ntransformer differential relay operated correctly, providing the\ntrip command to disarm T1 in about 2 cycles after the fault in-\nception time. The high- and low-voltage circuit breakers opened\nin about four cycles after the fault inception time [Fig. 4(d)].\nFig. 5 depicts the trajectory of the differential α-mode energy\noperating points during the ﬁrst cycle after the fault inception\ntime. In this type of fault, the proposed 87TW α differential\nunit must trip when the operation energy points are two times\nhigher than the restraining energy points after the internal fault\ninception time. Indeed, Ediff\nα presented a hard increase soon\nafter the fault inception time ( 2Eop\nα ≫E res\nα ) and detected the\ninternal fault successfully at 65 μs (Figs. 4(c) and 5). Therefore,\nthe trip provided by the proposed method would be faster than\nthe actual relay with the conventional protection system such as\nshown in Fig. 4(d).\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Delft Library.

External Fault and External Fault Clearance\nThe AB fault inside the T1 protection zone, described as\nan internal fault to T1 in Section III-B, is an external fault to\nthe differential relay that protects T2, as depicted in Fig. 3.\nFig. 6 depicts the currents measured in the transformer T2,\nthe differential α-mode energies, and the digital status of the\ncircuit breakers and the differential protections due to the AB\nfault on T1. As expected, the differential relay of T2 did not\ntrip. Therefore, the high- and low-voltage circuit breakers of\nT2 remained closed during the AB fault in T1 [Fig. 6(d)]. In\naddition, no false trip was issued by the relay in T2 during\nthe external fault clearance. Therefore, the existing protection\nFig. 7. α-mode energy operating points collected during the ﬁrst cycle after\nexternal fault initiation.\nsystem in T2 performed well for both the external fault and its\nclearance.\nFig. 7 depicts the trajectory of the differential α-mode energy\noperating points during the ﬁrst cycle after the fault inception\ntime. As expected, the 87TW α differential unit did not trip\nbecause 2Eop\nα ≪E res\nα from the beginning of the external fault\nto its clearance.\nD. Transformer Energization\nThe accurate detection of inrush currents is not a trivial task,\neven for existing commercial numerical differential relays. For\ninstance, several commercial numerical relays need additional\nprotection units based on the harmonic content, such as harmonic\nrestraint and harmonic blocking logics. Nevertheless, there is\nno guarantee of a proper performance during inrush current,\nespecially when the level of the second harmonic drops below a\nspeciﬁc threshold [6].\nAn actual energization maneuver took place at the monitored\ntransformer T1, in which the 230 kV terminal was energized\nunder no load. Fig. 8 depicts the currents measured at the\nhigh-voltage side of the transformer T1, the scaling coefﬁcient\nenergy of the high-voltage CT currents, the α-mode differential\nenergies, and the digital status of the circuit breaker CB1 and the\nactual differential protection. During the energization, the 2nd\nharmonic level of the phase C differential current dropped below\nthe 15% limit adjustment established for the harmonic blocking\nfunction. Therefore, the transformer differential relay operated\ninadvertently, providing a wrong trip command to disarm T1,\nwhich was opened in about two cycles after the beginning of\nthe maneuver. Therefore, Fig. 9 shows a case where the existing\nprotection in an actual power system failed during a transformer\nenergization. It is not the scope of this paper to address the\nperformance of the existing protection system and its settings.\nTherefore, more details about this case are unknown.\nIn Fig. 8(b), before the energization, the scaling coefﬁcient\nenergy is below the threshold related to the transformer load cur-\nrent. Therefore, a pre-energization was detected by the proposed\nmethod in accordance with (13). Furthermore, the threshold Eop\nα\nwas updated according to (17) and the slope Kα was increased\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Delft Library.

This fact did not happen during the internal\nfault, in which 2Eop\nα ≫E res\nα from the fault inception time to its\nclearance [Fig. 4(c)]. Therefore, this issue was properly solved\nwith the updating of both Eop\nα and Kα, as well as with the trip\ndelay in association with the trip counter, where the trip remained\nblocked from the beginning of the transformer energization\nmaneuver. Therefore, the transformer energization was properly\ndetected by the wavelet-based differential protection and no\nwrong trip would be provided to disarm T1 if the proposed\nmethod was installed to protect this power transformer.\nIV . P ERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT WITH SIMULATION DATA\nA power system with similar parameters to the actual system\ndescribed in section III (Fig. 3) was simulated in the ATP/EMTP\nsoftware environment for the performance assessment of the pro-\nposed method. Several challenging scenarios for the transformer\ndifferential protection were generated, as follows:\n1) Database 1 (internal faults):\na) turn-to-turn faults on phase A wye winding; turn-to-\nturn faults on the delta winding between phases A and\nB; turn-to-ground faults on phase A wye winding; and\nturn-to-ground faults on the delta winding between the\nA-to-B-winding and the earth. The percentage of the\nturns in the fault is equal to e={1,2,3,..., 98}% (392\nrecords).\nb) AG, BG, and CG faults on the high- and low-\nvoltage terminals of T1, inside the protection\nzone, with the fault inception angle of θf =\n{0,30,60,90,120,150,180} electrical degrees and\nfault resistance of Rf = {100,200,300} Ω (126\nrecords). θf corresponds to the phase A voltage angle\nat the fault point.\n2) Database 2 (external faults + CT saturation): AG, BG,\nCG, AB, BC, AC, ABG, BCG, ACG, and ABC faults\non the high- and low-voltage terminals of T1, but ex-\nternal to the T1 transformer protection zone, with θf =\n{0,30,60,90,120,150,180}electrical degrees and Rf =\n{1,10}Ω(280 records). The burden of CTs was intention-\nally increased in order to impose CT saturation.\n3) Database 3 (evolving external-to-internal faults): AG ex-\nternal faults with θf =90 ◦ and Rf =1 Ωon the high and\nlow voltage terminals of T1 evolving to turn-to-turn and\nturn-to-ground internal faults on transformer windings at\nthe same side of the faulted terminal. The percentage of the\nturns in the internal fault is equal to e={1,2,3,..., 98}%\n(392 records). Internal faults take place three cycles after\nthe external faults.\n4) Database 4 (transformer overexcitations): This event was\ninduced by applying a 140% overvoltage on the T1 high\nvoltage side with variations of θs ={0,1,2,..., 179,180}\nelectrical degrees (181 records), where θs is the phase A\nvoltage angle at the overvoltage point.\n5) Database 5 (transformer energizations): Switching per-\nformed by the high voltage side (230 kV) of T1, with\nits secondary terminal opened (CB2 opened) and with T2\nde-energized (CB3 and CB4 opened), and changing the\nhigh voltage circuit breaker closing time at angles θs =\n{0,1,2,..., 179,180} electrical degrees (181 records).\n6) Database 6 (transformer energizations with permanent\ninternal fault): Switching performed by the high voltage\nside of T1, with the secondary terminal opened (CB2\nopened) as well as the transformer T2 opened, changing\nthe high voltage circuit breaker closing time at angles θs =\n{0,90}electrical degrees for each case listed on database\n1 (784 records). There is a permanent internal fault at the\nswitching time;\n7) Database 7 (sympathetic inrushs): Switching performed\nby the high voltage side of T2, with its secondary ter-\nminal opened (CB4 opened) and with T1 previously\nenergized (CB1 and CB2 closed), and changing: the\nhigh voltage circuit breaker closing time at angles θs =\n{0,30,60,90,120,150,180} electrical degrees, the load\npower factor PF ={0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0}, and the X/R ratio\nof the circuit connected to the transformer high-voltage\nwinding X/R = {10.0,20.0} (56 records).\nThe databases 1-7 were generated by considering a typ-\nical signal-to-noise relation (SNR) of 60 dB.

The sampling frequency was fs = 1200 Hz and the\nfull-cycle Fourier algorithm was used in accordance with the\nreal situation in section III. Table I describes the settings used\nfor the conventional differential protection scheme according to\nrelay manufacturers’ recommendations [21], [22]. The 87Q unit\nis implemented with an intentional delay of two cycles in order\nto increase the security in its operation [18].\nThe proposed method presents only one function with neither\nphase segregation nor additional strategies such as harmonic\nrestraint and harmonic blocking, and it runs at fs = 15360 Hz,\nwhich is in accordance with the sampling frequency of the real\ndata shown in Section III. Its setting are automatically deﬁned\none shown in Sections II and III.\nTable II shows a performance comparison between both pro-\nposed and conventional methods regarding the success rate and\nthe delay in detecting the events of the databases 1-7.\nAccording to Table II, the external event detection mod-\nule of the proposed method (block 9) presented robust per-\nformance for all cases of external faults with CT saturation,\ntransformer overexcitations, and sympathetic inrushs, providing\nno trip (100% of success rate), and the inrush detection module\n(block 8) properly detected all single transformer energizations,\npresenting also a success rate of 100%, i.e., no trip in these cases.\nThe conventional method also presented a success rate of 100%.\nAn example of the proposed method performance for external\nevents is shown in Fig. 9, which depicts the CT currents and\nthe alpha-mode differential energies in a 140% overvoltage on\nthe 230 kV bus, but outside the transformer protection zone.\nAccording to Fig. 9(d), this event would be properly detected by\nthe block 9 as an external event and no trip would be provided\nbecause ΣTα(k) << Nα = 1\n2Δk during the event.\nRegarding the internal faults (databases 1 and 2), the proposed\n87TWα unit (block 10) was more accurate and faster than the\nconventional one, ensuring a success rate of 100% and detecting\nseveral faults with almost no change in the differential currents\nin which the conventional one failed, such as: turn-to-turn faults\non the delta side with less of 5% of the shorted winding, and all\nthe single-phase-to-ground faults between T1 and CT2 with Rf\n= 300Ω.\nThe proposed 87TW α unit was also more reliable and faster\nthan the conventional one regarding simultaneous events, such\nas evolving external-to-internal faults and transformer energiza-\ntions with permanent internal faults, presenting success rates\nand average operating time, respectively, of 98.47% and 9.51 ms\nagainst 96.43% and 54.54 ms, for evolving external-to-internal\nFig. 9.

Fig. 10 depicts the single-line diagram of the\nanalyzed three-phase power system. The system consists of a\n138 kV Thevenin equivalent connected to the primary winding\nof a transformer whose rated power is equal to 25MV A and ratio\nof 138:13.8 kV . A small distribution line connects a load of 10\nMV A and power factor of 0.92 to the secondary winding of the\ntransformer. The CTs connected to the primary and secondary\nwindings of the power transformer presented transformation\nratios equal to 200-5 and 2000-5 A, respectively. More details\nand information about the power system and power transformer\nparameters are ﬁnd in [23].\nThe same cases of the databases 1, 2, 5, and 7 were generated\nin order to verify the performance of the proposed method.

C ASE STUDIES\nA. A Single-Phase-to-Ground Fault Close to the Converter\nTransformer in an HVDC System\nFaults close to transformers in line-commutated converters\n(LCC)-HVDC systems can lead to transformer differential pro-\ntection relay misoperation due to high harmonic distortions in\nthe AC currents of the transformers. The performance of the\nproposed method was assessed considering two fault scenarios\nin the LCC-HVDC of the CIGRE benchmark test system [24]: a\nsingle-phase-to-ground fault between the 12-pulse rectiﬁer and\nthe transformer, but external to the transformer protection zone\n(external fault); and a single-phase-to-ground fault within the\ntransformer protection zone (internal fault). Both faults were\nsimulated with a fault resistance of 10 Ω. More details of the\nLCC-HVDC system can be found in [24].\nFig. 11 depicts the CT currents and the alpha-mode differen-\ntial energies monitored during the external fault. According to\nFigs. 13(a) and (b), the monitored currents on the AC side and on\nthe converter side presented a high harmonic content. However,\nthe proposed method was not affected and the external event was\nproperly detected by the external fault detection module, and no\ntrip was issued [Fig. 13(c)].\nFig. 12 depicts the CT currents and the alpha-mode differen-\ntial energies monitored during the internal fault. Similarly to the\nexternal fault, the monitored currents on the AC side and on the\nconverter side presented high harmonic content during the inter-\nnal fault [Figs. 12(a) and (b)]. Despite the high distortion level\nin currents, the proposed 87TW αelement properly detected the\ninternal fault in the ﬁrst cycle, 1.6 ms from the fault inception\ntime.\nFig. 11.

Therefore, it is expected\na good performance even in the presence of DC component\nand low-frequency harmonics, such as shown in these two case\nstudies. Nevertheless, it is necessary a more detailed evaluation\nof the proposed method in power transformers in HVDC systems\nin future works.\nB. A Lightning Conduction by a Surge Arrester Installed on\nthe Transformer Protection Zone\nThe impact on the proposed method performance caused by\nthe operation of surge arresters within the transformer differ-\nential protection zone is discussed in this Section. For this\nanalysis, the power system model shown in Fig. 3 was improved.\nA substation was modeled with the double bus single breaker\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Delft Library.

Coupling capacitor voltage\ntransformers (CCVTs) [27] and metal oxide varistor (MOVs)\nsurge arresters [26] were considered in each bay. Typical stray\ncapacitance values of power equipment such as circuit breakers,\ndisconnect switches, power transformers, and busbar [27] were\ntaken into account. A severe scenario was simulated considering\na 10 kA lightning striking directly on the transmission line, 1 km\naway from the substation. The currents in the secondary of the\nCTs in the HV and LV sides of the protected transformer, as well\nas the alpha-mode differential energies, are shown in Fig. 13.\nAccording to Fig. 13, the HV-side currents were affected\nby the lighting because the HV-side surge arresters are placed\nbetween the CT and the HV transformer winding. Conversely,\nthe LV-side currents were weakly affected by the lighting be-\ncause the HV-side surge arresters conducted during the lighting.\nBoth operating and restraining energies increased soon after the\nsurge transients in the power transformer. However, due to the\nfast and sharp decay of the surge wave, 2Eop\nα > Eres\nα just for\none sampling time [Fig. 13(c)]. Therefore, a small time delay\nstrategy could be used in the proposed protection to avoid the\nmisdetection of internal faults when the surge arresters conduct\nduring a lighting event. A more detailed evaluation of these cases\nwill be accomplished in future works.\nVII. C OMPUTATIONALBURDEN\nThe computational burden required by a protection method is\nan important parameter to verify the hardware implementation\npossibility. The basic requirement to a method run in real-time\nFig. 13. A surge arrester conduction inside the transformer protection zone:\n(a) iH\nA, iH\nB,a n d iH\nC ;( b ) iX\nA , iX\nB,a n d iX\nC ;( c ) α-mode differential energies.\nis that the computational burden must be less than the sampling\ntime 1/fs. Despite an ofﬂine assessment with massive data\nsimulated in the ATP/EMTP program, the proposed method\nwas implemented in the RTDS to demonstrate its practical\nfeasibility, presenting computational burden less than 50 μs.\nAnother possibility to evaluate the computational burden is\nto compute the number of ﬂoating-point operations (FLOPs)\nrequired by a protection method. FLOPs are considered to be\naddition and multiplication operations. Memory management\nwas not considered.\nThe proposed method needs only addition and multiplication\noperations, being quite simple. In addition, the number of FLOPs\nin the proposed method is regardless the sampling frequency. By\nusing the mother wavelet db(4), a boundary wavelet coefﬁcient\nenergy only requires 34 FLOPs per sampling time, which is the\nsame amount described in [16]. For any sampling frequency,\nthe proposed algorithm needs 790 FLOPs per sampling time by\nusing the mother wavelet db(4).\nAs a benchmark, the db(4) boundary wavelet coefﬁcient en-\nergy was implemented in a ﬂoating-point DSP for a real-time\nanalysis in [16], and the computational burden, per sampling\ntime, related to 34 FLOPs was about 1.70 μs. Considering\nthe same proportion, the proposed method would require about\n39.5 μs per sampling time (7.2 μs and 32.3 μs would be the times\nrequired to perform the processing of the Clarke and wavelet\ntransforms, respectively). Since the used sampling time is 1/fs\n= 65 μs, the proposed method could be properly implemented\nin that speciﬁc DSP.\nConsidering all sines and cosines stored in a buffer instead\nof computing them during the execution time, such as shown\nin [28], the conventional method based on the Fourier algorithm\nrequires addition, multiplication, and square root operations.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: TU Delft Library.

Restrictions apply. \nMEDEIROS et al.: CLARKE-WA VELET-BASED TIME-DOMAIN POWER TRANSFORMER DIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION 327\nSquare root operations consume several FLOPs depending on\nthe DSP. In addition, the computational burden of the con-\nventional Fourier-based method increases with the sampling\nfrequency. For instance, considering a sampling frequency of fs\n= 1200 Hz, such as set in this paper, the conventional method\nneeds 2406 FLOPs + 21 square root operations per sampling\ntime. This computational burden is higher than that provided\nby the proposed method. However, it must be accomplished\nduring 1/fs =833.33μs. By using the sampling frequency of the\nproposed method, i.e., fs =15 360 Hz, the conventional method\nneeds 27 894 FLOPs + 21 square root operations per sampling\ntime. This strong number of FLOPs must be accomplished\nduring 1/fs =65μs, requiring a powerful DSP. Nevertheless, it\nis not necessary to evaluate the phasor-based protection at fs =\n15 360 Hz, since one is interested until, at most, the 5 th harmonic.\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\nThis paper proposed a new time-domain transformer differen-\ntial protection based on the wavelet and Clarke transforms with\nonly one differential unit (87TW αunit), which is without phase\nsegregation and presents no need of additional harmonic content-\nbased functions. The performance of the proposed method was\ncompared to the conventional differential protection one consid-\nering both actual and simulated data.\nRegarding the actual data, the existing conventional protection\nfailed during an actual transformer energization due to the low\nharmonic content of the differential current, providing a wrong\ntrip, whereas the proposed method was successful in an ofﬂine\nanalysis of this case. Both existing and proposed methods prop-\nerly detected the actual internal fault. However, the proposed\nmethod detected it in 65 μs because it is based only in the\nhigh-frequency content of currents, whereas the existing one\ntook about two cycles to provide the trip.\nConsidering a great variety of simulated cases, both proposed\nand conventional methods presented security for all external\nevents. However, the proposed method presented the best per-\nformance and was the fastest for detecting internal faults, even\nin simultaneous events.\nThe use of both Clarke and wavelet transforms ensured a great\ncomputational efﬁciency and algorithm simplicity. Indeed, all\nequations present only addition and multiplication operations,\nwhich allows the method to be implemented in hardware envi-\nronment with a computational burden compatible with the used\nsampling frequency. In addition, the method was implemented\nin a real-time simulator, being a quite promising solution for the\npower transformer protection.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J. L. Blackburn and T. J.
