This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to fill this gap by synthesizing evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based CAs in improving mental health and factors influencing their effectiveness and user experience. Twelve databases were searched for experimental studies of AI-based CAs’ effects on mental illnesses and psychological well-being published before May 26, 2023. Out of 7834 records, 35 eligible studies were identified for systematic review, out of which 15 randomized controlled trials were included for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that AI-based CAs significantly reduce symptoms of depression (Hedge’s g 0.64 [95% CI 0.17–1.12]) and distress (Hedge’s g 0.7 [95% CI 0.18–1.22]). These effects were more pronounced in CAs that are multimodal, generative AI-based, integrated with mobile/instant messaging apps, and targeting clinical/subclinical and elderly populations. However, CA-based interventions showed no significant improvement in overall psychological well-being (Hedge’s g 0.32 [95% CI –0.13 to 0.78]).

These agents can\nassist with diagnosis, facilitate consultations, provide psychoedu-\ncation, and deliver treatment options\n1– 3, while also playing a role\nin offering social support and boosting mental resilience4– 6. Yet, a\nmajority of these CAs currently operate on rule-based systems,\nwhich rely on predeﬁned scripts or decision trees to interact with\nusers\n7. While effective to a certain degree, these rule-based CAs\nare somewhat constrained, primarily due to their limited capability\nto understand user context and intention. Recent advancements\nin artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), such as natural language processing\n(NLP) and generative AI, have opened up a new frontier--AI-based\nCAs. Powered by NLP, machine learning and deep learning, these\nAI-based CAs possess expanding capabilities to process more\ncomplex information and thus allow for more personalized,\nadaptive, and sophisticated responses to mental health needs\n8,9.\nDespite their advantages, AI-based CAs carry risks, such as\nprivacy infringement, biases, and safety issues10. Their unpredict-\nable nature may generate ﬂawed, potentially harmful outcomes\nleading to unexpected negative consequences11. To ensure the\nsafe and effective integration of AI-based CAs into mental health\ncare, it is imperative to comprehensively review the current\nresearch landscape on the use of AI-based CAs in mental health\nsupport and treatment. This will inform healthcare practitioners,\ntechnology designers, policymakers, and the general public about\nthe evidence-based effectiveness of these technologies, while\nidentifying challenges and gaps for further exploration.\nA plethora of research has examined the effectiveness of CAs in\ninﬂuencing mental health, indicating that CAs can effectively\nmitigate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and distress, while also\nfostering well-being and quality of life\n3,12– 15. However, these\nreviews have largely focused on speciﬁc types of CA12 or particular\ntypes of mental disorders 13,14. Two comprehensive systematic\nreviews and meta-analyses3,15 provide evidence that supports the\neffectiveness of various types of CAs across a range of mental\nhealth outcomes. However, the over-representation of studies\nutilizing rule-based CAs in these reviews leaves the effectiveness\nof AI-based CAs in improving mental health remains under-\nexplored. Moreover, the rapid progress in generative AI, such as\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), necessitates an exploration of this\ntechnology’s potential and pitfalls, amidst uncertainties associated\nwith its deployment in mental health care\n16. Yet, the latest studies\non these advanced technologies have not been incorporated into\nreview papers, and thus little is known about their effectiveness\ncompared to other types of AI-based CAs for mental health\nsupport. Beyond clinical effectiveness, user experience is vital in\nimpacting clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, prior reviews have not\nconclusively addressed user experience with AI-based CAs in\nmental health care or elucidated the factors driving the success of\nAI-based CA interventions.\n1Department of Communications and New Media, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117416, Singapore.2Department of Computer Science, National University of\nSingapore, Singapore 117416, Singapore.3Human-Computer Interaction Institute Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.4Center for Behavioral Intervention\nTechnologies, Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.5These authors contributed equally: Han Li, Renwen Zhang.\n✉email: r.zhang@nus.edu.sg\nwww.nature.com/npjdigitalmed\nPublished in partnership with Seoul National University Bundang Hospital\n1234567890():,;\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the\neffects of AI-based CAs on psychological distress and well-being,\nand to pinpoint factors inﬂuencing the effectiveness of AI-based\nCAs in improving mental health. Speci ﬁcally, we focus on\nexperimental studies where an AI-based CA is a primary\nintervention affecting mental health outcomes. Additionally, we\nconduct narrative synthesis to delve into factors shaping user\nexperiences with these AI-based CAs. To the best of our\nknowledge, this review is the most up-to-date synthesis of\nevidence regarding the effectiveness of AI-based CAs on mental\nhealth. Our ﬁndings provide valuable insights into the effective-\nness of AI-based CAs across various mental health outcomes,\npopulations, and CA types, guiding their safe, effective, and user-\ncentered integration into mental health care.\nRESULTS\nResults of systematic review\nSearches of twelve databases identi ﬁed 7834 unique citations\n(Fig. 1). We excluded 7301 records based on titles and abstracts,\nresulting in 533 records for full-text review. A total of 35 studies\nfrom 34 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria and were\nincluded in the systematic review for narrative synthesis. Among\nthe 35 studies, one randomized trial\n17 did not report sufﬁcient\ndata for calculating pooled effect size and 19 studies were not\nrandomized trials, leaving 15 randomized trials eligible for meta-\nanalysis to estimate the effectiveness of AI-based CAs on\npsychological outcomes. Table 1 presents selected major\ncharacteristics of studies included in the systematic review\n(additional details are presented in Supplementary Table 1 and\nSupplementary Table 2).\nOf the 35 studies included in our systematic review, 19\nemployed a quasi-experimental design, and 16 were randomized\ntrials. The studies involved 17,123 participants from 15 countries\nand regions. Most were single-site studies, with 14 conducted in\nthe United States and only one multi-site study conducted in the\nUK and Japan\n18. Studies were published between 2017 and 2023,\nwith 27 published since 2020. The majority of studies (n = 28) had\nsample sizes under 200. Participants’ ages ranged from 10.7 to 92\nyears. Five studies19– 23 focused on adolescents or children, while\nthe rest included adult populations. In terms of gender, one study\nexclusively evaluated female populations24, and the rest included\nboth genders.

We classiﬁed CA deployment into two categories: stand-alone: the CA operates independently without being part of any other system or application; integrated:the CA is incorporated into or combined with\nanother system, therapy, or service, which means that the CA is a component of a larger therapeutic system or framework.\n2. Study duration refers to the active period of the CA-based interventions, which did not include any subsequent follow-up periods.\nH. Li et al.\n5\nPublished in partnership with Seoul National University Bundang Hospital npj Digital Medicine (2023)   236 \nreport or screened symptoms of mental illnesses, and another\nseven studies19,24,35– 39 involved patients with diagnosed mental\nor physical issues. Study duration varied considerably, from several\nminutes to 6 months.\nWe extracted data on both the characteristics of the CA\nintervention and the technical design features of the CAs (see\nTable 2 for a summary). In total, 23 distinct CAs were evaluated\nacross the 35 studies. Most commonly, CAs were used for the\ndelivery of psychotherapy and/or psychoeducational content\n(n = 22). The integrative approach and CBT emerged as the most\nprevalent therapeutic approaches, represented in 11 and 6 studies\nrespectively. Additionally, several CAs were designed to offer\nsocial assistance, companionship, or act as a source of emotional\nsupport for users\n18,22,30,38,40– 43. There were also instances where\nCAs were employed for speciﬁc purposes such as coaching37,44,\ncounseling45, remote monitoring 42, teleconsultation 35 or to\ncoordinate within a larger system32. A signiﬁcant majority of the\nstudies ( n = 32) featured CAs as independent, stand-alone\nsystems.\nRegarding the design characteristics of CAs, smartphone and\ntablet applications emerged as the most popular platforms for\ndelivering CA interventions, featured in 16 studies. This was\nfollowed by widely used instant messenger platforms like Face-\nbook messenger ( n = 9), robots ( n = 5), web-based platforms\n(n = 3), and two studies used VR and EMDR, respectively. The\nmajority of the studies (n = 30) employed retrieval-based CAs to\ndirect conversations through a set of established responses. In all\nof these retrieval-based CAs, NLP was leveraged to analyze the\nintent and context of user inputs and to select the appropriate\nresponses. In some instances, this NLP capability was enhanced\nwith machine learning ( n = 7), emotion algorithm ( n = 6),\nreinforcement learning (n = 2), natural language understanding\n(n = 2), or neural network techniques (n = 2) to improve learning\nand contextual understanding. Conversely, a smaller set of studies\n(n = 5) implemented generative CAs for mental health interven-\ntions, which can generate wholly original dialogs. Of these, one\nemployed both GPT-2 and BERT\n27, the other four utilized GPT41,\nBERT45, LSTM 40 and DP 28, respectively. Regarding interaction\nmode, most studies used text-based CAs ( n = 24). In eight\nstudies22,29,38,42,43,45,46, CAs incorporated emotion AI, such as\nsentiment analysis, to understand users ’ emotional states and\naddress their in-situ needs. Other notable design features included\npersonalization and customization ( n = 20), regular check-ins\n(n = 10), mood tracking ( n = 8), empathic responses ( n = 7),\nmultimedia (n = 5), and human-like character and personality\n(n = 2). Despite the growing signi ﬁcance of safety concerns\nregarding CAs in mental health, only 15 studies incorporated\nsafety assessment or protection measures in CAs, such as access to\nhuman experts\n20,23,39, onboarding processes 19,20,25,26,31, assess-\nment of adverse events25,29,31,34 and automatic crises or harm\nidentiﬁcation17,19,25,31,34,36,41,42,46,47.\nThe studies evaluated a diverse range of mental health\noutcomes, with depression (n = 19) and anxiety (n = 18) being\nthe most frequently assessed (see Fig. 2 for a summary). In\naddition to the psychotherapeutic approaches, three studies\nincorporated social psychological theories including empathy\ntheory\n45, cultural competency theory 18 and goal attainment\ntheory44 to guide the CA intervention design. We did not identify\nany eligible studies that examined potential mediators accounting\nfor changes in mental health outcomes, highlighting a critical gap\nthat warrants further exploration. As for moderators, three studies\nprobed the moderating role of user engagement. Notably,\nincreased interactions were tied to enhanced effectiveness in\nreducing depression\n47 and anxiety symptoms 36,47. However,\nanother study20 observed divergent effects of interaction duration\nand amount on well-being, suggesting the need for more\nnuanced user engagement measurements to better understand\nthe relationship between user engagement with CAs and the\nmental health outcomes. Of the four studies examining\nparticipant-related moderators, those with severe baseline mental\nhealth symptoms reported greater reductions in psychological\ndistress\n34,48. Participants ’ concurrent therapies or treatments,\nhowever, showed inconsistent results. Speci ﬁcally, two studies\nnoted smaller reductions in anxiety25,34 and depression34 among\nthose engaging concurrent treatments, while another study\ndocumented larger reductions in depression in a similar cohort31.\nOne study34 also revealed that unmarried participants experi-\nenced greater reductions in depression and anxiety than self-\nidentiﬁed sexual minorities.\nNarrative synthesis of user engagement and experience\nOf the 35 studies, 19 detailed various measures of CA engage-\nment, including metrics such as the amount and length of\nconversations/messages (n = 13), frequency and duration of CA\nusage (n = 11), as well as the usage of speciﬁc modules or features\n(n = 5). User experiences with AI-based CAs were reported in\n16 studies, primarily focusing on satisfaction (n = 8), acceptability\n(n = 7), and usability (n = 5), followed by working alliance (n = 4),\nhelpfulness (n = 3), feasibility (n = 3), and likeability (n = 1). A total\nof 10 studies\n17,21,26,28,29,33,37,41,46,49 documented open-ended user\nfeedback on their experiences interacting with AI-based CAs.\nThrough inductive thematic analysis, these user feedbacks were\nclassiﬁed into positive and negative experiences and further\ncategorized into sub-themes (see Table3).

Participants from six studies emphasized the value of\nspeciﬁc therapeutic approaches or techniques ( n = 3) and the\nrichness of content ( n = 3). Moreover, participants from three\nstudies appraised the learning process facilitated by the CAs, and\ntwo favored accessibility. Text-based communication was\nregarded as a positive aspect in one study. Negative experiences\npredominantly revolved around communication\nbreakdowns– when the CA failed to effectively understand,\nprocess, and respond to user input ( n = 8). Content-related\nfactors, both in terms of topics and formats, were indicated as\nunsatisfactory elements during interactions (n = 4). The imperso-\nnal nature of CAs was highlighted in two studies as a contributing\nfactor to negative user experience while technical issues were\nreported in one study. Furthermore, in one study, participants\nvoiced dissatisfaction regarding the CA’s lack of initiative and its\ninteraction mode. Interestingly, one study found that participants\nsuffering from more severe symptoms expressed a preference for\nhuman support over CAs.\nResults of meta-analysis\nA total of 15 studies, involving 1744 participants, were eligible for\ninclusion in our meta-analysis. Among these, 13 trials examined\nindicators of psychological distress (Fig. 3), and eight trials\nassessed psychological well-being (Fig. 4). Compared to various\ncontrol conditions, participants interacting with AI-based CAs\nexhibited a signi ﬁcantly greater reduction in psychological\ndistress, with an effect size of g = 0.7 (95% CI 0.18– 1.22).

However, when we excluded two inﬂuential studies24,27, the\noverall effect sizes modestly decreased to 0.529 and 0.564,\nrespectively but maintained the same direction and signiﬁcance\n(refer to Supplementary Table 3). Interestingly, both of these two\nstudies employed generative CAs, suggesting that the response\ngeneration approach of CAs could potentially in ﬂuence their\neffectiveness. Although participants interacting with AI-based CA\nshowed improvements in psychological well-being, this enhance-\nment was not statistically signiﬁcant (g = 0.32; 95% CI – 0.13 to\n0.78), perhaps because of insuf ﬁcient power. Only eight trials\ninvestigated psychological well-being compared to 13 examining\npsychological distress. Additional meta-analyses on speci ﬁc\nmental health outcomes, detailed in Supplementary Figs. 1 – 4,\nindicated that CA interventions signiﬁcantly outperformed control\nconditions in ameliorating depression (g = 0.644, 95% CI\n0.17– 1.12). However, they did not signi ﬁcantly impact anxiety\n(g = 0.65, 95% CI – 0.46 to 1.77), positive affect (g= 0.07, 95% CI\n– 0.43 to 0.57) or negative affect (g= 0.52, 95% CI -0.67 to 1.71).\nAnalyses revealed signiﬁcant heterogeneity for both psycholo-\ngical distress (Q= 267.98, p < 0.001, I2 = 95.3%) and psychological\nwell-being (Q= 85.7, p < 0.001, I2 = 91.3%). Egger’s regression test\nsuggested no clear publication bias (Supplementary Table 4).\nWhile AI-based CAs demonstrated high effectiveness in addres-\nsing psychological distress, we graded the quality of evidence as\nmoderate. This decision was driven by the substantial hetero-\ngeneity observed across the studies and the wide con ﬁdence\ninterval of the effect estimate, which cast doubts on the\nconsistency and precision of the results. The grade of recommen-\ndation for AI-based CAs in enhancing psychological well-being\nwas rated as low (see Supplementary Table 5 for the Summary of\nFindings). The overall risk of bias was low for two studies, high for\nﬁve studies, and the remaining eight studies had unclear risk of\nbias. The most notable source of bias arose from performance\nbias, largely due to the lack of blinding of participants and\nFig. 3 Effects of AI-based CA interventions on psychological distress.Note: the pooled effect sizes (Hedges’g) on psychological distress\nwere reverse coded from their original values to align with the directionality of the pooled effect sizes on psychological well-being, i.e.,\npositive effect sizes indicate a more favorable outcome for the CA intervention compared to control conditions.\nFig. 4 Effects of AI-based CA interventions on psychological well-being.Note: positive effect sizes indicate a more favorable outcome for\nthe CA intervention compared to control conditions.\nH. Li et al.\n8\nnpj Digital Medicine (2023)   236 Published in partnership with Seoul National University Bundang Hospital\npersonnel, which aligns with ﬁndings from a previous study50.\nFurthermore, the presence of attribution bias in ﬁve studies,\ninﬂuenced by either improper methods of addressing missing\ndata or a signiﬁcant dropout rate, might have caused deviations in\nthe intended interventions (for a visual representation of risk of\nbias, see Supplementary Fig. 5).\nTo explore the potential sources of heterogeneity, we\nperformed subgroup analyses focusing on various participant-,\nstudy- and CA- related moderators. Regarding psychological\ndistress, the results showed that the ameliorative impact of CAs\nwas more pronounced for generative CAs (g= 1.244) in contrast\nto retrieval-based ones (g= 0.523, F(2, 19)= 4.883, p = 0.019), and\nstronger for multimodal/voice-based agents (g= 0.828) compared\nto text-based ones (g = 0.665, F (2, 19) = 3.655, p = 0.045).\nAdditionally, the effect was stronger when the intervention was\ndelivered through smartphone or tablet apps (g = 0.963) and\ninstant messengers (g= 0.751), than that observed for web-based\nplatforms (g = – 0.075, F (3,18)= 3.261, p = 0.046). As for partici-\npants’ characteristics, a larger effect size was observed in middle-\naged/older adults (g = 0.846) in comparison with adolescents/\nyoung adults (g= 0.64, F (2, 19)= 3.691, p = 0.044). Moreover, the\nreduction in psychological distress was more pronounced in the\nclinical/subclinical population (g = 1.069) compared to non-\nclinical population (g= 0.107, F (2,19)= 7.152, p = 0.005). Female\npercentage in the sample did not moderate the effects of CA on\npsychological distress (g = – 0.47, F (1, 19) = 0.105, p = 0.749).\nSimilarly, CA intervention effects on psychological distress did not\ndiffer by the type of control groups (F (5, 20)= 2.598, p = 0.06).\nYet, the effects of AI-based CA on psychological well-being did not\nexhibit signi ﬁcant variations associated with participants ’ age\n(F(2,12) =\n1.444, p = 0.274), gender (F(1, 12) = 0.462, p = 0.51),\nhealth status (F(2, 12)= 1.624, p = 0.238), the response generation\napproach (F(2, 12) = 1.253, p = 0.32), interaction mode (F(2,\n12) = 1.338, p = 0.299) and delivery platform (F(3, 11) = 1.677,\np = 0.23) of the CAs, or the type of control groups (F(4,14)= 0.175,\np = 0.948). The detailed results of subgroup analysis are presented\nin Supplementary Table 6.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we synthesized\nevidence on the effectiveness and user evaluation of AI-based CAs\nin mental health care. Our ﬁndings suggest that these CAs can\neffectively alleviate psychological distress, with the most pro-\nnounced effects seen in studies employing generative AI, using\nmultimodal or voice-based CAs, or delivering interventions via\nmobile applications and instant messaging platforms. CA-based\ninterventions are also more effective among clinical and\nsubclinical groups, and elderly adults. Furthermore, AI-based CAs\nwere generally well-received by the users; key determinants\nshaping user experiences included the therapeutic relationship\nwith the CA, the quality of content delivered, and the prevention\nof communication breakdowns.\nNotably, we observed a signiﬁcant and large effect size of AI-\nbased CAs in mitigating psychological distress (g= 0.7) compared\nto small-to-moderate effects (g ranging from 0.24 to 0.47)\nreported in a recent review that primarily included rule-based\nCAs\n15. This suggests that conversational agents enhanced by\nadvanced AI and machine learning technologies outperform their\nrule-based counterparts in managing psychological distress.\nFurthermore, the notably larger effect size of generative CAs\n(g = 1.244) relative to retrieval-based ones (g = 0.523) suggests\nthat the effectiveness of CA interventions may be inﬂuenced by\nthe response generation approach employed, which determines\nhow well these agents are capable of simulating human\nconversations. Given the rapid advancements in AI technologies,\nfurther investigations are warranted to explore the potential\nbeneﬁts and risks of generative CAs. Identifying conditions for\noptimal effectiveness of different response generation approaches\nis vital to developing evidence-based guidelines for the imple-\nmentation of various conversational agents across diverse clinical\ncontexts.\nWhile AI-based CAs consistently reduced psychological distress,\ntheir impact on psychological well-being was less consistent,\nwhich aligns with a previous review\n51. There are two possible\nexplanations for this result. First, fewer studies investigated\npsychological well-being ( n = 8) compared to psychological\ndistress (n = 13), which could potentially curtail the statistical\npower necessary to detect a signiﬁcant pooled effect on well-\nbeing\n52. Second, measures of psychological distress tend to be\nmore sensitive to recent experience-induced changes, while\nmeasures of psychological well-being are typically more stable\nover time, requiring sustained and long-term engagement. As\nsuch, future research should explore the long-term effects of AI-\nbased CAs to evaluate their effectiveness in promoting psycho-\nlogical well-being and to better understand CA effectiveness\nacross diverse mental health outcomes.\nMultimodal or voice-based CAs were slightly more effective\nthan text-based ones in mitigating psychological distress. Their\nintegration of multiple communication modalities may enhance\nsocial presence\n53 and deepen personalization, thus fostering a\nmore human-like experience 54,55 and boost the therapeutic\neffects56. In addition, a CA including text and voice functionalities\nmight support individuals with cognitive, linguistic, literacy, or\nmotor impairments. However, a recent study found text-based\nchatbots were better at promoting fruits and vegetable consump-\ntion\n57. This suggests that the effectiveness of chatbot modality\nmay vary based on context and desired outcomes, underscoring\nthe importance of adaptable, tailored CA designs. Moreover, a\nsigniﬁcant subgroup difference in psychological distress was\nnoted regarding CA’s delivery platform. Mobile applications and\ninstant messaging platforms may offer advantages in terms of\nreach, ease of use, and convenience when juxtaposed with web-\nbased platforms, potentially leading to enhanced outcomes.\nOur analysis also revealed that AI-based CAs were more\neffective in clinical and subclinical populations. This result echoes\nprevious studies suggesting that psychological interventions are\nmore effective for people with mental or physical health\nconditions compared to the general population\n51 and such effect\nis larger when mental health symptoms are more severe 58.\nHowever, prior research also shows that people with more severe\nsymptoms showed a preference for human support 37. This\nunderscores the need for research to untangle the complex\ninterplay between symptom severity, CA intervention, human\nsupport, and clinical outcomes, and to pinpoint the conditions\nunder which CAs are most effective and when human support is\nindispensable. Another interesting ﬁnding was that middle-aged\nand older adults seemed to beneﬁt more from AI-based CAs than\nyounger populations. One possible explanation might be the\nvariations in engagement levels, but due to the high hetero-\ngeneity across studies, we were unable to validate these\nassumptions. Future research is warranted, as a prior review\nsuggests a curvilinear relationship between age and treatment\neffects\n59. Notably, we did notﬁnd a signiﬁcant moderating effect\nof gender, consistent with earlier ﬁndings demonstrating that\ndigital mental health interventions are similarly effective across\ngenders60.\nIn terms of user evaluation, most studies included in our review\nreported positive feedback for AI-based CAs, suggesting their\nfeasibility across diverse demographic groups. Our analysis of\nopen-ended user feedback revealed that factors such as the\ntherapeutic relationship, content quality, and communication\nbreakdowns were key determinants of user experience, which\ncorresponds to previous psychotherapy research that identiﬁes\nthese common elements (e.g., therapeutic alliance, empathy, and\ntherapist effect) as active ingredients contributing to therapeutic\nH. Li et al.\n9\nPublished in partnership with Seoul National University Bundang Hospital npj Digital Medicine (2023)   236 \nchanges across various therapeutic frameworks61. Communication\nbreakdowns with CAs can lead to negative user experiences,\nmaking the intervention less likely to succeed. Although retrieval-\nbased CAs understand user context better than rule-based CAs,\ntheir limitations in generating responses can cause unnatural or\nrepetitive interactions, potentially reducing clinical effectiveness.\nDespite these factors being identi ﬁed as important based on\nqualitative user feedback, none of the included studies empirically\nexamined their mediating or moderating effects. Future research\nshould delve into these elements to understand the mechanisms\nof change and key components for successful CA interventions.\nThis review has its limitations. First, our broad search strategy,\nwhile exhaustive, led to considerable heterogeneity in outcome\nmeasures and results, making deﬁnitive conclusions and direct\ncomparisons challenging. Standardized evaluation methods for\nclinical and non-clinical outcomes in future studies would help\naddress this issue. Second, due to a limited number of studies\nreporting follow-up effects (n = 6) and the substantial variation in\nfollow-up durations, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis of\nthe long-term effects of CA interventions on psychological\noutcomes. Therefore, the lasting effects of CA interventions\nremain unclear. Third, by only including English-language pub-\nlications, we may have overlooked relevant studies in other\nlanguages, potentially limiting the generalizability of ourﬁndings.\nFourth, the narrative synthesis of user experiences heavily\ndepends on the interpretative reliability of the original studies,\nwhich may have methodological issues inﬂuencing their results.\nLastly, the realm of generative AI and LLMs is evolving at an\nunprecedented pace. While we identi ﬁed ﬁve studies using\ngenerative CAs powered by various generative AI models and\nframeworks, we were unable to examine the effect of speciﬁcA I\nmodels on outcomes due to the limited sample size. As the\nadoption of generative AI for mental health care expands, future\nresearch may beneﬁt from differentiating the impacts of various\ngenerative AI forms.\nAI-based CAs are surfacing as an impactful component in\nmental health care. This review provides preliminary and most up-\nto-date evidence supporting their effectiveness in alleviating\npsychological distress, while also highlighting key factors inﬂuen-\ncing effectiveness and user experience. While AI-based CAs are\nnot designed to replace professional mental health services, our\nreview suggests their potential to serve as a readily accessible and\neffective solution to address the expanding treatment gap. Future\nresearch endeavors need to delve deeper into the mechanisms\nand empirically evaluate the key determinants of successful AI-\nbased CA interventions, spanning diverse mental health outcomes\nand populations.\nMETHODS\nSearch strategy and selection criteria\nWe conducted a systematic search across twelve datasets, using a\nwide array of search terms. The search covered all data from the\ninception of each database up until Aug 16, 2022 and was later\nupdated to include new entries up to May 26, 2023. Weﬁne-tuned\nour search strategy based on previous systematic reviews\n3,51,62 to\nlocate sources related to AI-based CAs for addressing mental\nhealth problems or promoting mental well-being. The search was\nlimited to English-language publications. Complete lists of\ndatasets and search strategies are detailed in Supplementary\nTable 7.\nAfter removing duplicates, we screened all retrieved citations\nand abstracts in two stages: title/abstract screening and full-text\nreview. Two reviewers independently reviewed all titles and\nabstracts for eligibility, followed by a full-text review. At each\nscreening stage, a 10% subset of records was jointly reviewed to\nevaluate inter-rater reliability; disagreements were resolved\nthrough discussion, with the involvement of a third reviewer if\nneeded. Inter-rater reliability, assessed using Cohen ’s Kappa\n63,\nindicated near-perfect agreement for title/abstract screening (0.9)\nand full-text review (0.83).\nThe full description and examples of eligibility criteria are\noutlined in Supplementary Table 8. Brie ﬂy, we developed our\neligibility criteria based on PICOS framework: (1) Population: all\ndemographics or groups were eligible; (2) Intervention: we\nincluded studies that used an AI-based CA as the primary\nintervention, which entails a two-way interaction between a user\nand the CA. These AI-based CAs are deﬁned as software agents or\nbots that leverage NLP, machine learning or other AI models and\ntechniques to simulate human-like conversations. Unlike rule-\nbased systems that depend on predeﬁned rules or decision trees\nto formulate responses\n7, these agents possess the capability to\nunderstand user intent, analyze contexts, and retrieve or generate\nappropriate response based on the users’ input and the context of\nthe conversation; (3) Comparator: we included studies with any\ncomparison, ranging from active CA or human control groups to\nusual care, or those without a direct comparator, such as single\ngroup pre-post studies; (4) Outcome: we considered any outcomes\nrelated to psychological distress or well-being as eligible. These\ncould be measured through self-reported questionnaires, objec-\ntive metrics (e.g., audio or visual signals from passive sensing\nsystems) or third-party evaluations; (5) Study: we included any\nexperimental study design.\nData management and extraction\nWe developed a comprehensive data extraction form and pilot-\ntested it on a subset of included studies to ensure reliability and\nreproducibility. The following data were then extracted from all\nincluded studies: publication details (author, title, journal, year),\nstudy details (region, duration, method), participant characteristics\n(population type, sample size, demographics), CA intervention\ncharacteristics (deployment, session, role, target condition, safety\nmeasures), CA design features (name, delivery platform, AI model/\nframework/technique, interaction mode, and other reported\ndesign features), therapeutic orientation (e.g., cognitive behavioral\ntherapy; CBT), user evaluation approach (user engagement, user\nexperience, and other reported user feedback), psychological\noutcomes and measures, and mechanisms (theory, moderator,\nmediator).\nWe also extracted and narratively synthesized data related to\nengagement and user experience of AI-based CAs from studies\nreporting relevant information, encompassing users’ involvement,\ninteractions with CA interventions, and their affective and\ncognitive evaluations\n64. Moreover, we observed that some studies\nreported open-ended user feedback on their experiences with\nCAs, potentially providing insights into factors affecting the\nsuccess of CA interventions. To analyze user feedback, two coders\nperformed an inductive thematic analysis to identify prevalent\nthemes in user feedback and summarized these themes\nnarratively.\nMeta-analysis methods\nTo assess the effectiveness of AI-based CA interventions, we\nconducted a meta-analysis on randomized trials wherein partici-\npants were randomly assigned to an experimental group receiving\na target CA intervention or to control groups receiving alternative\ntreatments, information, or being placed on a waitlist. Since all of\nthe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported at least\none indicator of psychological distress (i.e., distress, depression,\nanxiety and stress)\n65 and/or psychological well-being (i.e.,\npsychological well-being, positive and negative affect, mental\nresilience, mental health self-efﬁcacy), we performed two separate\nmeta-analyses to estimate pooled effect sizes for these two overall\npsychological outcomes. Furthermore, we conducted meta-\nH. Li et al.\n10\nnpj Digital Medicine (2023)   236 Published in partnership with Seoul National University Bundang Hospital\nanalyses for speciﬁc psychological outcomes reported by at least\nthree trials, including depressive symptom, generalized anxiety\nsymptom, and positive affect and negative affect.\nThe meta-analyses were conducted using R software (version\n3.6.2) and themetafor package. Data were extracted from RCTs to\ncalculate pooled effect sizes of Hedges’ g, with corresponding\n95% conﬁdence intervals andP-values. Hedges’ g of 0.2 indicated\na small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect and 0.8 a large effect\n66. Since\nwe expected considerable heterogeneity among RCTs, random-\neffects models were used for all meta-analyses a priori. Hetero-\ngeneity among trials was assessed using Cochran’s Q test and I2.\nEgger’s regression test was used to evaluate publication bias. As\nmost trials contributed more than one observed effect size in\nassessing the two overall psychological outcomes, we ﬁt two\nthree-level random-effects meta-analytical models to account for\ndependencies between effect sizes, which allow effect sizes to\nvary between participants, outcomes, and studies67. We calculated\nHedges’g using post-intervention outcome data that provided\nmeans and standard deviations (SDs). When SDs were not\nreported, they were obtained by mathematical transformation68.\nWhen both intention-to-treat and completer analyses were\nreported, we extracted and analyzed the former. For studies with\nmulti-arm designs that included multiple experimental or control\ngroups, we combined the means and SDs from the different arms\nto create a single pair-wise comparison, as suggested by the\nCochrane guidelines for integrating multiple groups from a single\nstudy\n69. If a study did not report sufﬁcient data (mean, SD, SE, 95%\nCI) to calculate Hedges’g, we contacted corresponding authors for\nmissing data; studies lacking necessary data were excluded from\nthe meta-analysis. For sensitivity analysis, we employed a“leave-\none-out” method70 to identify inﬂuential studies and assess the\nrobustness of estimates.\nTo investigate potential sources of heterogeneity, we con-\nducted a series of subgroup analyses on the two primary\npsychological outcomes. In accordance with previous research,\nwe examined participant-speciﬁc characteristics (i.e., gender, age,\nand health status) as well as the type of control groups\n60.\nAdditionally, we considered three CA technical features (i.e.,\nresponse generation approach, interaction mode and delivery\nplatform) as potential moderators. We deﬁned response genera-\ntion approach as the technique a CA employs to formulate\nresponses to user inputs. For building AI-based CAs, there are two\nmajor response generation approaches: the retrieval-based\napproach and the generative approach. The key distinction\nbetween the two approaches stems from their underlying\nmechanisms in response generation. Retrieval-based CAs, like\nWoebot and Wysa, rely on dialog management frameworks to\ntrack the ﬂow of conversation and select appropriate responses\nfrom a pre-established repository of conversational utterances. In\ncontrast, generative CAs, such as ChatGPT and Replika, leverage\nmachine learning algorithms to learn and auto-generate\nresponses based on a large amount of training data\n71. In terms\nTable 4.

Li et al.\n11\nPublished in partnership with Seoul National University Bundang Hospital npj Digital Medicine (2023)   236 \nof the interaction mode, we categorized the CAs into text-based,\nwhere users communicate with the CA via textual messages, and\nmultimodal/voice-based, allowing users to engage with the CA\nusing either text or vocal inputs. Furthermore, based on the\nmedium through which the CA interacts with the users, the CAs\nwere grouped into smartphone/tablet app, instant messaging\nplatform, web-based platform, or robot.For categorical variables\nsuch as response generation approach, we used mixed-effects\nmodels for the subgroup analyses, while a meta-regression\napproach was employed for the continuous variable (i.e., gender).\nA detailed description of the moderators is outlined in Table4.\nWe employed the Cochrane risk of bias assessment\n72 to assess\nthe risk of bias in the included RCTs. This assessment tool\nevaluates seven domains of potential bias: selection bias,\nperformance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias\nand other bias. For each domain, a trial can be categorized as\nhaving a low, high or unclear risk of bias. For the overall risk-of-\nbias judgment, we adopted the approach from He et al.\n15\nSpeciﬁcally, a trial was deemed to have a low risk of bias only if all\ndomains were rated as low-risk. Conversely, any trial was judged\nto have a high risk of bias if it scored high in any domain, with the\nexception of performance bias. We excluded performance bias\nfrom this criterion due to the practical challenges associated with\nblinding participants and personnel in CA-based interventions\n50.\nTrials with at least one domain rated as unclear, but no domains\nrated as high risk were classiﬁed as having“some concerns”. For\nvisualization, the risk of bias was represented using Review\nManager (version 5.4).\nTo evaluate the quality of evidence presented in the two\nprimary meta-analyses of RCTs, we used the GRADE approach\n73,\nwhich provides a holistic assessment of the combined evidence\nfrom meta-analyses. It incorporates ﬁve key considerations, and\nthe quality of evidence may be downgraded if any of these are\nnot adequately met. Speciﬁcally, theﬁve considerations focus on\nstudy limitations (i.e., concerns about the risk of bias),\ninconsistency of the effects (i.e., variability in the effect\nestimates, often indicated by heterogeneity), indirectness (i.e.,\ndifferences in the population, intervention, or outcome from\nwhat was intended), imprecision (i.e., uncertainty in the effect\nestimate, e.g., wide con ﬁdence interval), and publication bias\n(potential underreporting of studies with negative or null\nresults). Conversely, factors like a large magnitude of effect or\nevidence of a dose-response gradient can lead to upgrades. The\noverall quality of evidence can be classiﬁed as high, moderate,\nlow, or very low.
