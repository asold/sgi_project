  "abstract": "Abstract The converter transformers are susceptible to more noise and vibration when compared to power transformers due to the presence of DC bias in the DC transmission line. DC bias occurs mostly due to inaccuracies in valve firing resulting in a small residual DC oscillating around zero. Measurement of magnetostriction becomes significant as it influences the vibration and noise from the core. Hence, a magnetostrictive model of a high‐voltage DC converter transformer has been developed. This work analyses the vibration and noise acoustics under such an occurrence. First, the core of the transformer model is designed in the stepped configuration for 240 MVA; then, magnetostrictive vibration is analysed by using suitable modules of COMSOL Multiphysics at different magnitudes of DC bias. The physics of noise has been interfaced using the Acoustics Module, and the results are recorded. Finally, artificial neural network model is developed for the prediction of vibration and noise characteristics of the model. The fitting process of neural network was then remodelled using various optimisation techniques, namely teaching–learning‐based optimisation, particle swarm optimisation, biogeography‐based optimisation, simulated annealing and binary coded genetic algorithm, and their results were compared to obtain the best‐suited method using % mean‐squared‐error evaluation.",
