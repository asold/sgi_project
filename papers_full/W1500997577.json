Introduction\nThe implementation of  lean methodologies has shown a significant improvement in \nthe terms of  increasing efficiency , reducing the total cost of  production and reducing \nthe wastes observed in processes. In order to achieve a lean environment in industry , a \nlarge number of  Lean Tools were developed such as Value Stream Mapping [VSM], \nLine Balancing, 5S, Kaizen and others. All these lean tools have their own capabilities \nand limitations. Some lean tools having a similar objective can provide good results, \nand we are always in search for tools that give fast results. It has been observed that \nin order to achieve leanness, many companies apply lean tools without a thorough \nanalysis and end up spending large amounts money , time and effort for little gain. \nApplying lean tools incorrectly results in a waste of  an organization’s time and money , \nas well as reduced confidence by employees in lean techniques and philosophy (Marvel \n& Standridge, 2009). It is a misconception that one lean tool is the solution to every \nproblem; therefore similar mistakes are repeated without achieving many results. \nThis paper focuses on the development of   based on an ANP [Analytic Network \nProcess] model. We tested the proposed approach with a manufacturing company \nthat wishes to remain anonymous. Based on its current situation the areas requiring \nimmediate attention are identified and suitable lean tools are suggested. The critical \naspects are followed with performance metrics. Finally , we will provide a prioritized list \nof  lean tools which needs to be implemented in order to reach the desired benchmark.\nII. Background\nA. Lean manufacturing\nThe concept of  Lean Manufacturing is the result of  the problems faced by Japanese \nmanufacturers after World War II. There were many problems such as shortage of  \nmaterial, human resources and many economies sunk into deficit as a result of  the \nwar. All these reasons forced the Japanese leaders to think towards improving their \nmethods in manufacturing. The great Japanese leaders like Kiichiro Toyoda, Shigeo \nShingo and Taiichi Ohno devised an altogether new, disciplined process-oriented \nsystem which was known as Toyota Production System or later Lean Manufacturing \n(Abdullah, 2003). \nKnowing the success stories of  the Japanese made the American leaders to actually \nvisit Japan and learn their techniques and style of  manufacturing. Thus the concept \nwas further extended in many ways and now we know it as Lean Manufacturing. \nThe core objective of  lean manufacturing is to add value to a product by minimizing \nthe resources required. This idea was later adapted in the US because the Japanese \ncompanies produced and distributed products with half  or less human effort, capital \n11\nRevista S&T, 12(28), 9-25. Cali: Universidad Icesi.\ninvestment, floor space, tools, materials, time and overall expenses (Womack, Jones & \nRoss, 1990).\nThe philosophy that the Japanese people follow of  doing business is somewhat \ndifferent than that followed by the Americans. The traditional belief  in the west was \nthat the only way to make profit was to add it on top of  the manufacturing cost in \norder to determine the selling price (Ohno, 1998). The Japanese approach believes that \nthe customers are the generators of  the selling price. The more quality one builds into \nthe product and the more service one offers, the higher the price the customer will pay. \nThe difference between this price and the cost of  the product is what determines the \nprofit (Ohno, 1998). The term lean indicates that the system should use less inputs \nthan mass-production systems to deliver the same output. It also aims at increasing \ncustomer satisfaction by providing a variety of  products. This business strategy has led \nto the evolution of  different terms such as Agile Manufacturing, Just-In-Time, World \nClass Manufacturing etc. these all different terms more or less run parallel with lean \nmanufacturing. Lean itself  means less. So this is applicable towards reducing most of  \nthe resources of  manufacturing such as cost, time, material and other resources. This \nis achieved by identifying and reducing wastes observed in the process. The Japanese \ncall waste ‘Muda’. \nShould the reader be interested in the implementation process, in details of  the lean \ntools and the results achieved by companies in industries, there are ample resources in \nthe literature that cover these topics in detail (Rivera, 2008; Womack and Jones, 1996; \nWomack, 2002; Liker and Convis, 2011; Nicholas, 2010).\nB. Analytic Network Process [ANP]\nAHP [Analytic Hierarchy Process] was proposed by Saaty (1980) as a method of  \nsolving socio-economic decision making problems and has been used to solve a wide \nrange of  problems. AHP requires the decision maker to provide judgments about the \nrelative importance of  each criterion and then specify a preference for each decision \nalternative using each criterion (Gungor, 2005). The output that AHP generates is a \nprioritized ranking of  the alternatives based on the overall preferences expressed by \nthe decision maker or the end customer. However, many decision problems cannot be \nstructured hierarchically because they involve the interaction and dependence of  higher-\nlevel elements on a lower level element (Saaty , 1996). Structuring a problem involving \nfunctional dependence allows for feedback among clusters of  decision elements, thus \nthey can be arranged in form of  a network showing one-to-one dependency of  cluster \nelements. Saaty suggested the use of  Analytic Network Process [ANP] to solve the \nproblem of  dependence among alternatives. ANP can be used as an effective tool \nin cases in which the interactions among the elements of  a system form a network \nstructure. ANP replaces hierarchies with networks, in which the relationships between \nlevels are not easily represented as higher or lower, dominated, or being dominated \ndirectly or indirectly (Saaty , 1996). \n12\nhttp://www.icesi.edu.co/revistas/index.php/sistemas_telematica  \nWan, H-d., Sahasrabudhe, A.M. & Rivera, L. (2014). Prioritization of lean tools using gap analysis and analytic network process...\nThe ANP is more of  a generalization of  the AHP . The feedback structure has cycles \nconnecting its components which are not described in levels. It also has loops which \nstates that somehow the component is connected to itself. A source node denotes an \norigin of  paths of  importance. A sink node is a destination of  paths of  importance. \nA full network can include source nodes; intermediate nodes that fall on paths from \nsource nodes, lie on cycles, or fall on paths to sink nodes; and finally sink nodes (Saaty , \n1996). Some networks can contain only source and sink nodes. Still others can include \nonly source and cycle nodes or cycle and sink nodes or only cycle nodes (Figure 2). \nThe main challenge that is observed in the formulation of  such a model is to determine \nthe priorities of  the elements in the network and also the alternatives of  the decision. \nBecause feedback involves cycles, and cycling is an infinite process, the operations \nneeded to derive the priorities become more demanding than has been familiar with \nhierarchies (Saaty , 1996).\n1. The fundamental scale\nTo make a comparison between the various components in the network or hierarchy , \nsome judgments are made in quantitative terms. Instead of  simply assigning a \ncomparison score on an arbitrary basis, a specific numerical value is assigned. Table 1 \npresents the fundamental scale.\n1 Equal Importance\n3 Moderate Importance of  one over \nanother\n5 Strong Importance\n7 Very Strong Importance\n9 Extreme Importance\n2,4,6,8 Intermediate Values\nReciprocals are used for Inverse Comparisons\nTable 1. Fundamental scale for Pairwise comparison\nThe values as shown in Table 1 are assigned during the pairwise comparison in such \na way that they will denote the importance of  one component over the other. It is \nassumed that when the inverse comparison is made, the reciprocals of  the respective \nassigned value are used. This helps in keeping the consistency of  the model.\n2. Pairwise comparison and dependency\nWithin the ANP network, there is sometimes dependency of  one component on other. \nThe same can be observed for the alternatives. In AHP , a hierarchy comprises of  a goal, \nlevels of  elements and then the alternatives. A network has a cluster of  elements and their \ndependencies on each other. A hierarchy can be considered as a special case of  network \nwhere the connections are unidirectional considering their respective dependencies. Figures \n1 and 2 give a general idea of  how a hierarchy and a network will look like.\n13\nRevista S&T, 12(28), 9-25. Cali: Universidad Icesi.\nThere are two types of  dependencies that are observed in either of  the models: \nouter and inner. An outer  dependency compares the influence of  one component on \nthe other. An inner dependency compares the influence of  one alternative on the other \nwithin the criteria or component as described in this paper. Figures 1 and 2 both show \nthe inner and outer dependencies of  components and alternatives.\nFigure 1. Linear Hierarchy model (Saaty , 1980, p.5)\nFigure 2. Network model (Saaty , 1980, p.5)\n\n14\nhttp://www.icesi.edu.co/revistas/index.php/sistemas_telematica  \nWan, H-d., Sahasrabudhe, A.M. & Rivera, L. (2014). Prioritization of lean tools using gap analysis and analytic network process...\nIII. The two-step decision model \nThe two-step model we propose consists of  two stages. The first one is the GAP \nanalysis and the second is the ANP used for prioritizing the lean tools. Figure 3 shows \nthe flow chart of  the two-step model. \nIn the first stage, performance metrics are evaluated on the basis of  urgency using \nthe GAP analysis technique. The data obtained is from the current state and the \nbenchmark. The second stage is to introduce the ANP tool to prioritize the lean tools. \nThe information obtained from the two stages when combined in a proper way will \ngive the required prioritized list of  lean tools.\nA. GAP analysis\nGAP analysis (which stands for ‘Good’, ’Average’ and ’Poor’) is a tool used to compare \nthe actual performance with the expected or ‘target’ performance. The purpose of  the \ngap analysis is to use self-study to quickly identify the most obvious gaps and then use \nthe existing resources to fill those gaps (Gilbert, 2008). It provides a foundation for the \nFigure 3. The two-step model\n15\nRevista S&T, 12(28), 9-25. Cali: Universidad Icesi.\nmeasurement of  investment done with respect to time, money and human resource. In \nthis research, GAP analysis is done on the critical areas observed in a manufacturing \nfirm, labeled as performance metrics. This gap in the performance is translated in \nterms of  percentages and the term used to denote this is urgency.\nThe urgency can be calculated using a simple formula (Equation 1). One important \nthing to be noticed is the use of  absolute values. The absolute values maintain the \nconsistency of  the problem.\nThe ANP model proposed in this research is based on a hypothetical case. The values \nare assumed after a careful study considering the consistency of  the model and do not \nrelate directly to any special cases. These values are just to demonstrate the working \nof  the model proposed.\nB. The ANP model\nThe proposed ANP model is shown in Figure 4. The blocks denote the components \nshowing dependency on each other. The description of  the blocks is as follows.\nFigure 4. The ANP model\nLean Tools: This block contains the list of  lean tools that needs to be ranked by their \npriority.\nPerformance Metrics: These denote the critical areas where the firm needs to focus its \nattention. They highlight the performance of  the firm.  \nCurrent State: It denotes the current situation of  the firm with respect to the identified \nperformance metrics.\nBenchmark: It is the target that the firm aims to achieve.\n16\nhttp://www.icesi.edu.co/revistas/index.php/sistemas_telematica  \nWan, H-d., Sahasrabudhe, A.M. & Rivera, L. (2014). Prioritization of lean tools using gap analysis and analytic network process...\nUrgency: This describes the level of  Importance of  the performance metrics over \neach other. \nThe output of  the model will be a prioritized list of  lean tools for every performance \nmetrics as well as for the whole scenario. \nIV . Example case study\nThe hypothetical case considered in the example below will demonstrate the working \nof  the proposed two-step model. The Table 2 shows four main critical areas of  the \nperformance metrics that the manufacturing firm needs to work upon.\nPerformance Metrics Current State Benchmark Urgency (%)\nLead Time 30 days 23 days 23.33\nSafety 7 incidents per \nquarter\n5 incidents per \nquarter\n28.57\nUtilization 72% 85% 18.06\nQuality 80% 95% 18.75\nPM's Lead Time Safety Utilization Quality\nLead Time 1  1/2 3 2\nSafety 2 1 4 3\nUtilization  1/3  1/4 1 1\nQuality  1/2  1/3 1 1\nSum 3.83 2.08 9 7\nTable 2. Hypothetical case\nThe component of  urgency plays an important part in determining the degree of  \nseriousness. There might be cases where a certain area exceeds others by a significant \nmargin. Then it is logical that one can make a decision of  directing all the efforts to \nimproving that area first. \nThe next step is performing the pairwise comparison of  those components that \nhave a direct influence on each other. In this paper we perform a pairwise comparison \nbetween Performance Metrics and Lean Tools.\nThe pairwise comparison of  the lean tools is for each of  the performance metrics \ndefined in the problem. The significance of  performing it was to obtain a cumulative \nvalue for each alternative. The alternatives are the lean tools to be applied. Tables 3 \nto 7 show the pairwise comparison made assigning the proper importance scale. The \nvalues from the fundamental scale (Table 1) are used.\nTable 3. Pairwise comparison of  the performance metrics\n17\nRevista S&T, 12(28), 9-25. Cali: Universidad Icesi.\nTable 4. Pairwise comparison of  the lean tools for Safety\nTable 5. Pairwise comparison of  the lean tools for Lead Time\n18\nhttp://www.icesi.edu.co/revistas/index.php/sistemas_telematica  \nWan, H-d., Sahasrabudhe, A.M. & Rivera, L. (2014). Prioritization of lean tools using gap analysis and analytic network process...\nTable 6. Pairwise comparison of  the lean tools for Quality\nTable 7. Pairwise comparison of  the lean tools for Utilization\n19\nRevista S&T, 12(28), 9-25. Cali: Universidad Icesi.\nOnce the proper values are inserted into the table, the sum of  the respective columns \nis found. This gives the numeric value of  the importance of  one lean tool over other. \nThe next step is to do the matrix multiplication. This is done to obtain a normalized \nmatrix. The matrix multiplication yields an Eigenvalue for each of  the components \nand alternatives. The matrix multiplication is carried out a number of  times equal \nto the number of  components/alternatives under consideration. It is denoted as ‘n’. \nThe Eigen value that corresponds to (n-1)th iteration is considered. The next step is to \nfind out the prioritized matrix by taking the values of  the sum of  rows as the weights \nof  the corresponding lean tool and taking an average of  those weights to get the \nnormalized matrix.\nThen we calculate the Lambda (\n ) values, which are the product of  the Eigenvalue \nand the sum of  weights for the respective lean tools.\nThe principal Eigenvector is the sum of  all the lambda values that we have obtained. \nThis term will determine the consistency of  the matrix in the model.\nNext, we check for the consistency of  the matrix. This is to know if  the weights \nthat have been considered are consistent and relevant in their approach. Since ANP \nis a decision making process, it is important that the preferences between lean tools \nexpressed are consistent. This is the purpose of  the Inconsistency Index. The \nInconsistency Index is a measure of  deviation from consistency and the value obtained \nshould be less than or equal to 10% of  the overall result. Equation 2 shows the formula \nfor the Inconsistency Index.\n= Principal Eigen Vector (sum of  all the lambda values)\nn= number of  components/alternatives\nThen we find the consistency of  the matrix (equation 3). \nThe Random Index (RI) is a predetermined number, given according to the ‘n’ value. \nFor this paper, RI values of  0.9 and 1.53 are considered for n values of  4 and 12, \nrespectively.\nV . Results and discussion\nWe demonstrate the use of  the model with calculations and results for Safety , one of  \nthe Performance metrics considered: \nPairwise Comparison results are shown in Table 8.\nThe lambda values obtained are as shown in the Table 9.\n20\nhttp://www.icesi.edu.co/revistas/index.php/sistemas_telematica  \nWan, H-d., Sahasrabudhe, A.M. & Rivera, L.

ANP can also reveal the complexity of  a particular decision. \nIts approach represents the interest of  the decision makers and expresses judgments \nabout the relationships among the decision criteria. It is a process that uses the \ninformation from the decision maker in a simple manner. The ANP makes pairwise \ncomparisons between the decision factors and provides fairly good results. Being \nsimple in its approach, the tool is widely used to address a variety of  concerns \nregarding opportunities, risks and benefits. The model does not require strong \nassumptions. It can be applied to even simple decision making processes as it does \nnot involve mathematical complexities that require specialized training. \nThe success of  any model depends upon the validation of  its results. In this \nresearch the ANP model provides a prioritized list of  lean tools which may not be \na perfect solution but a sensible one for the preferences expressed by the decision \nmakers. This is because of  the variations in the importance levels obtained from the \nuser’s side. The rankings obtained can vary. This is the main limitation of  using \nANP , thus it is important to have a good knowledge of  lean tools before providing \nthe importance levels during the pairwise comparisons.\nThe results obtained can be refined more using a more sophisticated method \nfor calculating lean scores. Building a simulation model will help to visualize the \nprocess and can be an extension of  the model. \n24\nhttp://www.icesi.edu.co/revistas/index.php/sistemas_telematica  \nWan, H-d., Sahasrabudhe, A.M. & Rivera, L.
