    "abstract": "A reverse approach to transformer design is presented in this paper. The physical characteristics&#13;\\nand dimensions of the windings and core are the specifications. By manipulating the amount and&#13;\\ntype of material actually to be used in the construction of the transformer, its performance can be&#13;\\ndetermined. Such an approach is essentially the opposite of the conventional transformer design&#13;\\nmethod. Both design methods are applied to two sample high voltage transformers. The measured&#13;\\nperformances of the as-built transformers highlight the limitations in using the conventional&#13;\\nmethod, which are overcome using the reverse approach.",
