Taking advantage of its recognized reliability and quality of the simulations, we developed a computer\nprogram that use parallel sessions of SIMNRA to perform self-consistent analysis for energy spectra of a given sample\nobtained using diﬀerent techniques or experimental setups. In this paper, we present a result using MultiSIMNRA on\nself-consistent analysis for a multielemental thin ﬁlm produced by magnetron sputtering. The results demonstrate the\npotentialities of the self-consistent analysis and its feasibility when using MultiSIMNRA.\nKeywords: Self-consistent analysis, ion beam analysis, computer simulation, SIMNRA, MultiSIMNRA\n1. INTRODUCTION\nComputational tools always played an important role\nin the data interpretation of ion beam analysis (IBA)\ntechniques during its historical development [1]. Since\nthe early times many advances occurred in the compre-\nhension of physical processes and measurement system\neﬀects, always followed by advances in the correspond-\ning computational modeling [2].\nCurrently, SIMNRA is a widely adopted software by\nthe IBA community [3]. Its strength lies on trusted\nmodeling of the physical processes involved in the scat-\ntering calculation and measurements system e ﬀects. It\nwas recently reported that upgrades can be expected\nfor its new version concerning the skewness of en-\nergy spread distributions, improved handling of reaction\ncross-sections with structure, generalized layer rough-\nness, and sample porosity [4].\nDuring the last decade, one approach that has become\na trend in the ﬁeld and represents a great advance for\nthe development of the analysis software is the simul-\ntaneous analysis of multiple measurements of ion beam\ntechniques, the so called self-consistent analysis. This\n1Corresponding author. e-mail: tfsilva@if.usp.br\napproach has gained attention since it ensures the reli-\nable and unequivocal modeling of the sample [5], but\nequally important, the self-consistent analysis inherits\nthe accuracy of the most accurate component of the\nanalysis [6,7].\nTaking advantage of the recognized reliability and\nquality of the simulations provided by SIMNRA, we de-\nveloped a program for self-consistent analysis based on\nSIMNRA calculations. MultiSIMNRA uses computa-\ntional algorithms to minimize an objective function run-\nning multiple instances of SIMNRA, ﬁnding the set of\nparameters that best ﬁts simultaneously all experimental\ndata. A more detailed information about MultiSIMNRA\nand its methods shall be published in the near future.\nIn this paper, in order to demonstrate its potentiali-\nties and feasibility, we present a result obtained using\nMultiSIMNRA for the self-consistent analysis of a mul-\ntielemental thin ﬁlm produced by magnetron sputtering.\n2. METHODS\n2.1. Sample description\nThe sample consisted of a thin ﬁlm of a mixture of\naluminum, titanium and tantalum deposited on top of\nPreprint submitted to Nuc. Instr. Meth. Nuc. Res. - Section B November 9, 2018\narXiv:1803.01946v1  [physics.ins-det]  1 Mar 2018\nan amorphous carbon substrate using magnetron sput-\ntering [ref]. Previous analysis found contamination of\nthe elements hydrogen, carbon and oxygen in the ﬁlm.\nThe aim of the present analysis is to determine the con-\ntamination depth proﬁles.\n2.2. Experimental measurements\nWe use diﬀerent techniques to obtain the depth pro-\nﬁle for each element and contaminants in this sam-\nple. For the quantiﬁcation of the major elements in the\nﬁlm (Al, Ti and Ta), a usual Rutherford Back-scattering\nSpectrometry (RBS) analysis provided the quantiﬁca-\ntion and depth proﬁle. However, for the contaminants\nit was necessary to perform speciﬁc measurements to\nincrease the sensitivity. Determination of O and C\nwith their respective depth proﬁles were obtained using\nElastic Back-scattering Spectrometry (EBS) with non-\nRutherford resonant cross-section for diﬀerent energies\nof incident beam. An Energy Recoil Detection Analy-\nsis (ERDA) analysis was used for the detection of the\nelement H.\nThese measurements were divided into four irradia-\ntions with a 4He beam. Detectors recording the energy\nspectra at two di ﬀerent scattering angles were used to\ncollect a total of eight spectra. In the ﬁrst three irra-\ndiations, surface barrier detector detectors (both with\n20-keV energy resolution) were placed at scattering an-\ngles of 170 ◦ (1.46-msr solid angle) and 120 ◦ (0.731-\nmsr solid angle) wherein three di ﬀerent beam energies\n(2.200, 3.044 and 4.274-MeV) were used to probe the\nsample. The fourth irradiation (also at 2.2-MeV) was\nused in a ERDA conﬁguration to enable the detection of\nrecoiled H atoms. In this setup, the beam incidence an-\ngle on the sample was 80◦ and one detector was placed\nat a scattering angle of 20 ◦ with a 12-mm thick alu-\nminum foil as absorber for stopping elastically scat-\ntered He (in this conﬁguration the detector solid angle\nis 0.485 msr and the detector increases to 65-keV due\nto the angular straggling). Simultaneously to this FRS\nmeasurement, another detector was placed at 170◦ scat-\ntering angle to collect data of the RBS measurement at\ngrazing angle increasing depth resolution, and complet-\ning the set of eight spectra.\n2.3. Basic physical data\nTwo important sources of uncertainty in IBA tech-\nniques are the stopping power and the cross-sections\ndata. In the special case of the self-consistent approach\nthe accuracies of these databases are critical since in-\naccuracies inevitably lead to discrepancies in the joint\ninterpretation of multiple spectra.\nThus, the choice of accurate databases for stopping\nand cross-section data is of major importance. For that,\nMultiSIMNRA has the option to use SRIM stopping\npowers for all spectra under analysis. Despite the good\ninternal database of SIMNRA, the use of SRIM [10]\ndata is preferable for traceability purposes, since its re-\nsults are intensively confronted to experimental data and\nvice-versa [11]. For the cross-sections case, evaluated\ndata provided by SigmaCalc [12] can be obtained in\n[13,14] and incorporated in the SIMNRA reaction list.\nAfter that, the appropriate cross-section must be con-\nﬁgured in each of the SIMNRA ﬁles. The beam en-\nergy in the EBS analysis (4.274-MeV for C and 3.044-\nMeV for O) was adjusted to the position of the reso-\nnance in the cross-sections for each case, increasing the\nsensitivity for quantiﬁcation (approximately 100 times\ngreater for C and 20 times greater for O at the surface).\nSigmaCalc data were also used in the calculation of\nthe FRS measurements since the p(a,p) a recoil cross-\nsection deviates from Rutherford being approximately\n10 times higher at 2.2 MeV .\n2.4. MultiSIMNRA features\nIn order to ﬁt the set of experimental data, the\nMultiSIMNRA code minimizes the mean reduced χ2 as\nan objective function. This is evaluated as follows:\nχ2\nred = 1\nS\nS∑\ns=1\n\n1\nNs − Ps − Pp\n·\n∑\nchannels\n(Mi − Ti)2\nσi\n(1)\nwhere Mi and Ti are respectively the calculated and ex-\nperimental value of counts in channel i of a spectrum\ns, S is the total number of spectra, Ns is the number of\nchannels in the ﬁtting region of the spectrum s, Ps is the\nnumber of ﬁtting parameters in the setup conﬁguration\nfor the measurement of the spectrum s, and Pp is the\nnumber of ﬁtting parameter in the sample depth proﬁle.\nThe use of the reduced χ2 as objective function en-\nsures that all spectra in the analysis have the same sta-\ntistical weights in the end of the minimization process.\nIn principle, in the beginning of the convergence it is\nexpected that spectra with more integrated counts have\nlarger statistical weight but, it is also expected that,\nwhen the simulated data converges to the experimen-\ntal data, this weights converges to the same values (all\nreduced χ2 values tends to the unity). What means that,\nthis objective function gives priority for the spectra with\nlarger integrated counts in the beginning of the mini-\nmization process but converges for the same statistical\nweights when getting closer to the minimum.\nMultiSIMNRA counts with four minimization algo-\nrithms to minimize the mean reduced χ2 of the set of\n2\nFigure 1: A thin ﬁlm of a mixture of Al, Ti and Ta analyzed using multiple techniques (the dots are experimental data) and the continuous line are\nthe ﬁt using MultiSIMNRA. A, C, E and G spectra were obtained with detector placed at 170 ◦ scattering angle. B, D and F spectra were obtained\nwith detector at 120◦ scattering angle. And spectra G, the detector was placed at 20◦ scattering angle. Incidence angle for the G and H spectra was\n80o.

In the case of this study, Simplex algorithm was\nused, and Evolutionary Annealing Simplex for reﬁne-\nments. Are also available: Di ﬀerential Evolution and\nLevemberg-Marquart. The ﬁrst and the latter are useful\nwhen the number of ﬁtting parameters is low, and the\nother two have a larger convergence time, but are more\neﬃcient when the number of ﬁtting parameters is high.\nThe features of MultiSIMNRA were designed to pro-\nvide to the user a smooth experience in self-consistent\nanalysis using SIMNRA. One of these features is the\n3\nFigure 2: Depth proﬁle obtained using MultiSIMNRA that best ﬁts\nall experimental data of Fig. 1.

A\nLink is a feature that says to MultiSIMNRA the rela-\ntionship between ﬁtting parameters. In the case of this\nanalysis, the detector electronics calibration, gain and\noﬀset for the spectra collected by the same detector were\nlinked, reducing the number of ﬁtting parameters from\n16 to 4. Also, for the EBS measurements the beam en-\nergy was left as ﬁtting parameter within a range of 0.3%\nof the energy read out. The beam energy of simultane-\nous measures was linked, reducing these number of ﬁt-\nting parameters from 8 to 4. The deﬁnition of Links in\nMultiSIMNRA is important not just because of the re-\nduction of the convergence time by the direct reduction\nof ﬁtting parameters, but also to establish conditions and\nreductions in degrees of freedom for the ﬁtting process.\nThe deﬁnition of links tying the ﬁtting parameters in-\ncreases the accuracy of the analysis. Another possibil-\nity of the Link feature is to correlate element concentra-\ntions simulating a chemical bound, but this feature was\nnot used in the present analysis.\n3. RESULTS\nFig. 1 shows the set of eight spectra with the\ncorresponding SIMNRA calculations according to the\nMultiSIMNRA ﬁtted parameters. The corresponding\ndepth proﬁles for the contaminants are shown in Fig.\n2. Besides, the beam energy for the EBS spectra was\nderived by the ﬁt, and deviation of 0.24% for the 3.044-\nMeV case and a 0.08% for the 4.274-MeV case were\nfound. These are excellent values and the ﬁtting uncer-\ntainties lie under 0.05\n4. DISCUSSIONS\nThe RBS measurements (spectra A and B) can give\ngood results for Al, Ti and Ta quantiﬁcation, but have\nlow statistics for the determination of the precise con-\ncentrations of C and O. These elements can be assessed\nusing EBS measurements taking advantages of the res-\nonances that occur at 4.400 MeV and 3.038-MeV beam\nenergies for scattering cross-sections of He in C (spectra\nC and D) and O (spectra E and F) respectively. Addi-\ntionally, an RBS measurement at grazing angle (spec-\ntrum G) can provide good depth resolution for proﬁle\ndetermination for all elements and the ERDA measure-\nment (spectrum H) complements the analysis providing\nthe concentration of H. Handling the data simultane-\nously and self-consistently, it was possible to obtain the\ndepth proﬁle for contaminants presented in Fig.2. It is\npossible to observe the oxidation of the ﬁlm in the in-\nterfaces, and the di ﬀusion of H through the substrate\ninterface (which lies approximately at 500 TFU).\n4\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nMultiSIMNRA can be a powerful tool to ﬁt multiple\nenergy spectra of scattering techniques using SIMNRA\ncalculations. The easy-to-use-philosophy implemented\nin MultiSIMNRA and inspired by SIMNRA can pro-\nvide a smooth experience for the user. Besides, the Link\nfeature provides a possibility to include prior knowledge\ninto the analysis.\n6.
