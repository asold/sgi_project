Introduction\nWe tackle the 2D human pose recognition problem\n[19, 1, 32, 22] where keypoints (e.g. head, shoulders, knees,\netc.) for multiple people in an RGB image are to be detected\nand localized. This is an important problem in computer vi-\nsion that can be adopted in a variety of downstream tasks in-\ncluding tracking, security, animation, human-computer in-\nteraction, computer games, and robotics.\nThere has been a steady progress in 2D human pose\nrecognition [1, 32, 36, 22, 17, 2, 25, 29, 24, 6, 5, 28, 41, 23]\nwith systems becoming increasingly practical without a\nstrong constraint ( e.g. present multiple people of varying\nsize). However, pose recognition is a challenging problem\n* indicates equal contribution.\nCode: https://github.com/mlpc-ucsd/PRTR.\nWork performed during internships of K. Li, S.Wang, and X.

The difﬁculty lies in various aspects\nsuch as large pose/shape variation, inter-person and self oc-\nclusion, large appearance variation, and background clutter.\nFor multiple people in an input image [19], the task of\npose recognition is to localize the human keypoints (17 in\nthe experiments) for the individual persons. This can be\nachieved by a two-stage process in which individual per-\nsons are detected ﬁrst, followed by keypoint detection from\nthe detected image region/patch; this is called a top-down\nprocess [28]. An alternative strategy is called a bottom-up\nprocess where human keypoints are detected directly from\nthe image without an explicit object detection stage [6]. A\ndiscussion about the top-down and bottom-up approaches\ncan be found in [6].\nAnother way to divide the existing literature in pose\nrecognition is based on the choice of using heatmap or\nregression. Heatmap-based approaches [37, 28] perform\ndense keypoint detection followed by subsequent processes\n1\narXiv:2104.06976v1  [cs.CV]  14 Apr 2021\nfor clustering and grouping; they deliver strong perfor-\nmance but are also subject to many heuristic designs that are\nmostly not end-to-end learnable. Regression based methods\n[29, 41, 35] perform regression for the keypoints directly\nwhich have less intermediate stages and speciﬁcations.\nRegression-based methods typically perform worse than\nheatmap-based ones, but can be made end-to-end and read-\nily integrated with the other downstream tasks. Reasons for\nthe existence of both heatmap-based and regression-based\nmethods are present. Heatmap-based methods are adopted\nwhen the accuracy is the priority whereas regression-based\napproaches can be considered as a convenient plug-and-play\nmodule.\nGenerally, heatmap-based methods adopt handcrafted\nor heuristic pre/post-processing to encode ground truth to\nheatmaps and decode heatmaps to predict keypoints. These\nmethods introduce design challenges and biases, making\nthem sub-optimal. They are hard to update and adapt as\nwell. In detail, SimpleBaseline [37] and HRNet [28] adopt\nthe standard coordinate decoding method designed empiri-\ncally according to model performance in [22], reﬁning the\ncoordinates 0.25 time from the maximum activation to the\nsecond maximum empirically in the heatmap. DARK [40]\npresents Taylor-expansion based coordinate decoding and\nunbiased sub-pixel centered coordinate encoding. UDP [15]\neven discovered a considerable accuracy decrease when us-\ning one-pixel ﬂip shift in heatmap-based paradigms. For\ngeneral-purpose regression methods, we aim at removing\nunnecessary designs by making the training objective and\ntarget output direct and transparent. Coordinates should be\noutput directly and the loss be calculated with predictions\nand ground truth coordinates straightforward.\nBearing this in mind, we present a top-down regression-\nbased 2D human pose recognition method using cascade\nTransformers consisting of a person detection Transformer\nand a keypoint detection Transformer. Two alternatives\nhave been developed, one being a two-stage process (shown\nin Figure 2) with the two Transformers learned sequen-\ntially and the other being a sequential process (shown in\nFigure 3) with the two transfomers learned jointly in an\nend-to-end fashion. We name our method Pose Regression\nTRansformers (PRTR). We apply multi-scale features in the\nkeypoint detection Transformer. Visualization for the key-\npoint queries across different attention layers in the decoder\nis given to illustrate the internal detection process. PRTR\nis a general-purpose approach for keypoint regression and\nwe show competitive results in pose recognition when com-\npared with the existing regression-based methods in the lit-\nerature. The contributions of our work include:\n• We propose a regression-based human pose recognition\nmethod by building cascade Transformers, based on a\ngeneral-purpose object detector, end-to-end object de-\ntection Transformer (DETR) [3]. Our method, named\npose recognition Transformer (PRTR), enjoys the tok-\nenized representation in Transformers with layers of self-\nattention to capture the joint spatial and appearance mod-\neling for the keypoints.\n• Two types of cascade Transformers have been developed:\n1). a two-stage one with the second Transformer tak-\ning image patches detected from the ﬁrst Transformer, as\nshown in Figure 2; and 2). a sequential one using spatial\nTransformer network (STN) [16] to create an end-to-end\nframework, shown in Figure 3.\n• We visualize the distribution of keypoint queries in var-\nious aspects to unfold the internal process of the Trans-\nformer for the gradual reﬁnement of the detection.\nOn the COCO 2D human pose recognition dataset [19],\ncompetitive results have been observed when compared\nwith the regression-based methods.\n2. Related Work\nGiven an image I, the goal of pose recognition is to pre-\ndict a possibly empty set of persons, {Pi}N\ni=1, where N is\nthe number of persons in the image. For each person, we\nneed to predict its bounding box position, bi, as well as its\nskeleton coordinates, si = {(xj,yj)}J\nj=1, where J is the\nnumber of joints pre-deﬁned in each dataset.\nWe discuss related work from several aspects. The\nﬁeld of human pose regression has witnessed a continuing\nprogress [1, 32, 36, 22, 17, 2, 25, 29, 24, 6, 5, 28, 41, 23], in\nparticular with the advancing of the deep learning technolo-\ngies [18, 12, 14]. One notable development in pose recogni-\ntion is the creation of the HRNet family model [28, 6] which\nis itself about a new convolutional neural network (CNN)\narchitecture targeting the modeling of high-resolution fea-\nture responses. HRNet [28] has shown its particular advan-\ntage in advancing the state-of-the-art for 2D human pose\nrecognition/estimation.\nHeatmap-based approaches include [2, 13, 25, 21, 17,\n24, 6, 5, 37, 28, 40, 39, 30] where various techniques have\nbeen developed to perform multi-class keypoint classiﬁca-\ntion. The classiﬁers produce dense heatmaps (classiﬁcation\nmap), followed by clustering and grouping processes. On\none hand, heatmap-based methods leverage ﬁne-grained de-\ntection for the keypoints by densely scanning all the pixels;\non the other hand, heatmaps create a disconnection from the\noverall estimation of the keypoints, making the intermedi-\nate clustering and grouping process not directly integrable\nto be end-to-end learning frameworks.\nRegression-based methods [4, 41, 23, 35, 29] aim to di-\nrectly approach keypoint detection with a direct loss mini-\nmization between predicted and ground truth coordinates,\nhence, they can be more easily integrated into an end-\nto-end learning framework. However, holistic regression\ncan be intrinsically more difﬁcult to optimize due to the\n2\nCrop Transformer EncoderSelf-AttentionFeed-ForwardSelf-AttentionFeed-Forward\nTransformer DecoderSelf-AttentionCross-AttentionFeed-ForwardSelf-AttentionCross-AttentionFeed-Forward… Person ClassifierBounding Box Regressor\nSet of Person Features\nTransformer EncoderSelf-AttentionFeed-ForwardSelf-AttentionFeed-Forward… Transformer DecoderSelf-AttentionCross-AttentionFeed-ForwardSelf-AttentionCross-AttentionFeed-Forward… Keypoint ClassifierCoordinate Regressor\nSet of KeypointFeatures ×N people\nℎ!\"#(%)\nℎ'(!!(%)\nℎ()*!(%)\n…\n\"𝑦()*!\n\"𝑦!\"#\n\"𝑦'(!!\nBackbone\nPositional Encoding\n\"𝑦+,(-ℎ+,(-(%)\n… …\n…\n…\n…\nPositional Encoding\nBackbone\n…\nFigure 2: The architecture of Pose Recognition with TRansformer (PRTR), two-stage variant. First, using whole-picture image feature\nand absolute positional encoding, a person-detection Transformer detects people in the image with a set of learned person queries. After\nﬁltering background queries, we crop the original image with predicted boxes. Cropped images are fed into a keypoint-detection Trans-\nformer, together with positional encoding relative to corresponding bounding boxes. Finally, we read out J keypoints from a larger set of\nkeypoint queries by Hungarian algorithm.

Furthermore,\nregression-based approaches typically have a recursive pro-\ncedure [9] that skips a large number of candidate locations,\ncreating a performance gap with the heatmap-based meth-\nods. Our work follows the line of regressive pose estima-\ntion, and formulates the process of step-by-step regression\n[9, 4] implicitly in a layered Transformer way.\nTransformers and self-attention The attention mech-\nanism [38, 33, 8] has greatly advanced the ﬁeld of rep-\nresentation learning in machine learning. The introduc-\ntion of Transformers [33] to object detection gives another\nleap-forward in building end-to-end object detection frame-\nwork that is free of proposal, anchor, and post process-\ning (non-maximum suppression). Here, we build cascade\nTransformers based on the DETR [3] framework to perform\nregression-based pose recognition. Our system, named\nPRTR, aims towards a general-purpose keypoint regression\nsolution without speciﬁc heuristic-driven designs.\nRecently, Transformer architecture and self-attention\nhave seen increasing application in computer vision tasks\n[26, 3, 10], yet there are limited visualization works com-\npared with those done on language application [7, 34]. As\nfar as we know, we are the ﬁrst to visualize the dynamic de-\ncoding process in Transformer decoder, which brings sig-\nniﬁcant insights to future Transformer designs.\n3. Method\nWe argue that the attention mechanism in Transformer\ncan act as a general-purpose inference engine for regres-\nsion in vision tasks by writing visual perception as a\nBayesian inference P(Y|I) ∝ P(I|Y)P(Y) with Y =\n(ˆyelb, ˆyknee,··· , ˆynose). Here, Transformer for regression\nperforms direct learning and inference by capturing com-\nplex joint relations between inputIand prediction hypothe-\nses (queries), P(I|Y), through cross-attention, and model-\ning the prior on conﬁguration of Y, P(Y), via hypothesis\n(query) self-attention. See Figure 1.\nIn this section, we instantiate this idea as Pose Recog-\nnition with TRansformer (PRTR) for multi-person pose\nrecognition. The overall architecture is shown in Figure 2.\nWe ﬁrst introduce a cascaded double Transformer architec-\nture for person and keypoint detection, then an end-to-end\nvariant to streamline the entire model.\n3.1. Person-Detection Transformer\nWe tackle multi-person pose recognition problem in a\ntop-down manner, and adopt a Transformer architecture\n[33] following DEtection TRansformer (DETR) [3] as the\nbackbone for the ﬁrst-stage person detection. In the encoder\nstage, image features generated by a CNN are ﬂattened and\nfed into a Transformer encoder to produce contextualized\nimage features; in the decoder stage, given a ﬁxed set of\nlearned query embedding as input, Transformer decoder\nreasons about the relations between objects under the con-\ntext of image features, and output all the object queries in a\nparallel way. At last, a classiﬁcation head is used to classify\nthe object as person or background ( ∅), and a 4-channel\nregression head is used to predict the bounding boxes.\n3.2. Keypoint-Detection Transformer\nAfter getting the bounding boxes, we crop the RGB im-\nage and use another CNN backbone to get feature maps per\n3\nPerson-detection\nTransformer \nEncoder\nBounding\nBoxes 𝐺\nPerson-detection\nTransformer\nDecoder\nPerson \nPredictions\nKeypoint\nPredictions\nGrid generator\nKeypoint-detection\nTransformer\nEncoder\nKeypoint-detection\nTransformer\nDecoder\n𝒯(G)\nSample\nBackbone\nSample\nSample\nFigure 3: The architecture of Pose Recognition with TRansformer ( PRTR), end-to-end variant.

Because only matched queries are involved in cal-\nculating the loss for keypoint-detection Transformer, we ﬁl-\ntered out unmatched ones. Like the process of person detec-\ntion, we use the encoder-decoder architecture of the Trans-\nformer to predict in a parallel fashion, but we use another\nset of queries (quantity denoted Q). Finally, a classiﬁcation\nhead predicts among J types of joints and background ( ∅)\nand a 2-channel regression head outputs the coordinate of\neach keypoint.\nSince PRTR infers a ﬁxed larger number of predictions\nthan ground truth (quantity denoted J), we need to ﬁnd a\nmatching between them to calculate the loss. We formu-\nlate this matching problem as anoptimal bipartite matching\nproblem, which can be solved efﬁciently by Hungarian al-\ngorithm [27]. In speciﬁc, we try to ﬁnd an injective function\nσ∈[J] →[Q] that ﬁrstly minimizes the matching cost Cin\na discrete way:\nC= arg min\nσ\nJ∑\ni\nC\n(\nyi,ˆyσ(i)\n)\n(1)\n, where ˆyσ(i) means the prediction to be matched with the\ni-th keypoint.\nAt training stage, we match our queries using a mix-\nture of classiﬁcation probabilities and coordinate deviation.\nFor instance, the cost function for the i-th keypoint and its\nmatched query σ(i) is:\nCi = −ˆpσ(i)(ci) +∥bi −ˆbσ(i)∥ (2)\n, where ˆpσ(i) is the class probabilities of the query and\nci is the class label for i-th keypoint. However, at infer-\nence stage, we do not have access to the ground-truth key-\npoint coordinates, thus we match J prototype keypoints to\nqueries using only the classiﬁcation probabilities. Therefore\nthe matching cost for i-th keypoint is simply:\nCi = −ˆpσ(i)(ci) (3)\nAfter running the bipartite matching algorithm, we re-\nturn the matched J keypoints as our prediction.\nThe loss function of the model is obtained by replac-\ning negative probabilities in Equation 2 with negative log-\nlikelihood −log ˆpσ(i)(ci) for matched queries. For un-\nmatched queries we only backpropagate the classiﬁcation\nloss. To address the class imbalance caused by ∅ class, as\nin [3], we set the weight of its log-probability term to 0.1.\n3.3. Multi-layer Cropping with STN\nIn the previous section, we introduce a two-stage\npipeline. However, under an end-to-end philosophy, it is\ndesired that the model is end-to-end tunable to exploit the\nsynergy between person detection and keypoint recognition\ntask. To this end, we incorporate the Spatial Transformer\nNetwork (STN) [11] to crop out image features needed by\nthe keypoint-detection Transformer directly from the fea-\nture map generated by the ﬁrst CNN backbone. This crop-\nping operation is differentiable not only to the feature maps,\nbut also to the bounding box coordinates.\nFor instance, an w × h grid generated by b =\n(xleft,xright,ytop,xdown) can be formulated by:\nxi = w−i\nw xleft + i\nwxright (4)\nyj = h−j\nh ytop + j\nhydown (5)\n, where bis relative to the original image, and w×his the\ndesired feature map size for the keypoint-detection Trans-\nformer.\nTo mitigate the resolution challenge commonly seen in\nkeypoint recognition, we apply the grid to feature maps of\ndifferent scales generated at different intermediate layers of\nthe CNN backbone using a bilinear kernel.

This multi-layer crop-\nping variant is illustrated in Figure 3.\n4. Experiment\nWe validate our proposed method on the COCO Key-\npoint Detection task and MPII Human Pose Dataset.\n4.1. Experiment Setup\nDatasets. We used two human pose estimation datasets,\nCOCO and MPII. The COCO dataset [19] contains over\n200,000 images and 250,000 person instances. Each per-\nson instance is labelled with 17 joints. We train our model\non COCO train2017 dataset with 57K images, and evalu-\nate our approach on the standard val2017 and test-dev2017\nsplit, containing 5K and 20K images respectively. The MPII\nsingle person dataset [1] consists of around 25K images and\n40K well-separated person instances. We follow the stan-\ndard train/val split.\nEvaluation metrics. We follow the common practice in\n[28] and use Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS) for COCO\nand Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) for MPII to\nevaluate the performance.\nPerson-detection Transformer ﬁnetuning. We ﬁrst\ntune a person detector by initializing from weights provided\nby DETR [3]. We keep all weights except prototype vec-\ntors for non-person class in the classiﬁer. The tuning lasts\nfor 10 epochs with a leaning rate of 1e −7 for ResNet-50\nbackbone and 5e−6 for the rest. For pose recognition task,\npeople without any visible keypoints are not desired to be\ndetected; these people have a common characteristic of be-\ning small in area. In fact, all people with a segmentation\narea less than 322 do not contain keypoints. Given this, we\nskipped person annotations without visible keypoints at this\nstage for both training and evaluation. After tuning, the per-\nson detector scores an mAP of 67.0 on the pruned val2017\nset, and an mAP of 50.2 on the standard val2017 set.\nTwo-stage variant. For the two-stage version of our\nmodel, we extend the human detection bounding box in\nheight or width to a ﬁxed aspect ratio ( 4 : 3 for COCO).\nA patch is cropped using the box and then resized to\na ﬁxed size, 384 ×288 or 512 ×384 for COCO. The\ndata augmentation follows [37], including random rotation\n([−40◦,40◦]), random scale ( [0.7,1.3]), and ﬂipping. The\ndata pre-processing remains the same for MPII, except for\naspect ratio set to 1 : 1and input size available in384×384\nor 512 ×512. For the Transformer part, number of encoder\nlayers, decoder layers and keypoint queries are set to 6, 6,\n100 respectively.\nWe use the AdamW optimizer [20]. The base learning\nrate is 1e −5 for ResNet backbone and 1e −4 for the rest,\nwith weight decay 1e −4. Multi-step learning rate sched-\nule is used, which halves the learning rate at the 120th and\n140th epoch respectively. The training process terminates\nwithin 200 epochs for both datasets.\nTesting. At test time, We use the person detection results\nfrom the tuned person detector (with AP 50.2 on COCO\nval2017 set) for both COCO val and test-dev set. Inspired\nby the common practice of ﬂip-test [5, 22, 37] used in\nheatmap paradigms, we compute the keypoint coordinates\nby averaging the outputs of original and ﬂipped images.\nEnd-to-end variant. For the end-to-end variant, we\nuse ground truth to match predicted people after person-\ndetection Transformer, and discard unmatched queries be-\n5\nTable 2: Comparisons on COCO test-dev set, excluding systems trained with external data. + means using multi-scale test.\n∗ means end-to-end model variant.

For images with more than 5 peo-\nple, we randomly sample 5 matched queries to reduce\ncomputational cost. Bounding boxes predicted by person-\ndetection Transformer are enlarged by 25% at both the\nheight and width dimension before sampling image features\nfrom backbone features, which helps predicting keypoints\nat the margin by taking in more contextual information.\nWe used the same data augmentation as DETR [3] ex-\ncept randomly resizing the image to having its shortest side\nbeing 760 to 1024 while not exceeding 1400.

The two-stage variant of our approach out-\nperforms the competing baselines in the regression based\ncategory. Our model with ResNet-101 backbone is compa-\nrable to PointSetNet [35] which leverages a more complex\nbackbone (HRNet-W48).

Our\nbest model achieves a 89.5 PCKh@0.5 score, comparable to\nthat of SimpleBaseline [37]. Not needing a person detection\nstage, MPII is not tried with the end-to-end variant.\n4.3. Ablation Studies\nWe perform ablation studies on COCO dataset to verify\nour design choices as listed in Table 4 and 5. The results\npresented are on COCO val2017, with ResNet-50 backbone\nand input size 384 ×288.\nNon class-speciﬁc queries. We make the queries of\nTransformer decoder to predict both keypoint coordinates\nand classes, and then select the required points from all\nthe queries via class probabilities. This way, we do not\nenforce a ﬁxed correspondence between J keypoint types\nand queries. Therefore, the queries are not class-speciﬁc\nTable 5: Ablation study on COCO val2017. ’GT Box’, ’∅\nLogit’ represent ground truth box for cropping, and inclu-\nsion of background logits during inference respectively.\nGT\nBox\n∅\nLogit\nFlip\nTest AP AP50 AP75 APM APL AR\n67.1 87.6 74.5 62.6 74.7 73.7\n\u0013 69.1 90.1 77.0 66.1 73.7 73.9\n\u0013 66.2 87.2 73.5 62.1 72.8 72.8\n\u0013 \u0013 68.2 89.7 75.5 65.3 72.5 72.9\n\u0013 67.7 87.7 74.9 62.6 75.7 74.2\n\u0013 \u0013 70.4 91.2 78.3 67.1 75.2 74.7\n\u0013 \u0013 66.4 86.9 73.0 62.0 73.4 72.8\n\u0013 \u0013 \u0013 68.9 89.9 75.8 65.7 73.4 73.2\nand can be used to predict different types of keypoints each\ntime. Here, we focus on two alternative designs: a) different\nnumber of queries used; b) when number of queries equals\nthe number of required points, the necessity for queries to\nbe non class-speciﬁc. From Table 4, it is clear that 100-\nquery version only has a small advantage over 50- and 17-\nquery counterparts. However, using class-speciﬁc queries\nwill greatly hamper the performance of the model, resulting\nin a large drop in AP (11.4). This illustrates the necessity\nthat each query dynamically predicts its preferred keypoint\ntype, and reads out the best estimation through Hungarian\nmatching during inference.\nExclusion of background prediction during infer-\nence. During inference, we exclude the logits of the\nbackground class ( ∅) before normalizing class probabili-\nties to provide more keypoint candidates for the Hungarian\nmatcher. From Table 5, we observe that including the logits\nof background class will result in a 0.9−1.5 drop in AP.\n7\nFigure 5: Visualization of 16 keypoint (excluding the background class) prediction out of Q = 100queries in the keypoint-detection\nTransformer on COCO val2017. Each colored dot represents a predicted keypoint for the corresponding class.\nFigure 6: Qualitative COCO human pose estimation results\non images of varying sizes and poses.\nFlip test. Flipping is a common test augmentation used\nin heatmap paradigms, where input image is horizontally\nﬂipped and fed to the model, and then ﬂip back, align and\naverage the predicted heatmaps to increase accuracy. The\nsame technique applies to regression models as well, with\nresults obtained by directly averaging the predicted key-\npoint coordinates. Since regression operates on continuous\ncoordinate space, one advantage is that it does not suffer\nfrom the inaccuracy caused by alignment errors in heatmap\nparadigms, as described in [15]. From Table 5, ﬂip test of-\nfers a consistent performance boost for our model.\nOracle results. We also explore the room for improve-\nment by replacing the bounding boxes predicted by person-\ndetector with ground truth (GT) ones, as in Table 5. It is\nevident that GT boxes improves AP by 2 −2.5, indicating\nthe potential beneﬁt of a stronger person-detector.\n4.4. Vis. for Keypoint Detection Transformer\nIn this section, we show visualizations for the keypoint\ndetection Transformer. In Figure 5 and Figure 7 we visu-\nalize the position and class distribution for keypoint pre-\ndictions by the queries. Different queries are observed to\nbias towards different keypoints ( e.g. in our model 92.3%\nof the predictions by the 89th query are nose keypoints).\nWe also observe that queries dedicated to certain keypoints\nare biased to speciﬁc locations ( e.g. the query focusing on\nthe nose tends to predict positions in the upper part of the\nimages) while the points predicted by queries focusing on\nbackground are uniformly distributed.\nnose\nL eye\nR eye\nL ear\nR ear\nL shoulder\nR shoulder\nL elbow\nR elbow\nL wrist\nR wrist\nL hip\nR hip\nL knee\nR knee\nL ankle\nR ankle\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 6\n0 0 99 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 13\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 99 0 2 0 2\n0 99 0 0 0 2 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 99 0 0 0 0 2 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 94 0 0 21 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 1 0 0 2 97 2\n0 0 0 0 0 85 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 1 2 16 0 0 0 0 98 3 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 43 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 4\n99 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 0 0 0 0 0 35 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 18 0 0 0 0 0 11 0 3\n0 0 0 0 98 2 38 13 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 43\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 91 0 0 0 1 0 2\n0 0 0 98 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 3\nFigure 7: Visualization of distributions of predicted key-\npoint classes for 16 out of a total of Q = 100 queries in\nthe keypoint-detection Transformer. Numbers on heatmap\ncorrespond to the probability (×100) for the individual key-\npoint classes. We observe that queries learn to specialize on\nkeypoint classes.\nIn Figure 4, we explore and visualize query output results\nin different decoder layers during inference. The ﬁrst row\n8\nshows the queries selected by the Hungarian algorithm and\ndemonstrate how their predictions move and reﬁne through\nlower-to-higher decoder layers. Initially, the predictions are\nrandomly located in the image. After passing some decoder\nlayers, queries predictions gradually approach the proper lo-\ncations. It is noteworthy that if a query’s prediction is close\nto the ground truth in lower layers, its prediction barely\nchanges in higher layers.\nThe second row shows the spatial probabilities of a cer-\ntain type of keypoint. For visualization, Gaussian heatmaps\nare ﬁrst generated around the predicted keypoint locations,\nwith their peak values proportional to class probabilities;\nthen the heatmaps of all Q queries are stacked to form a\nsingle probability map. Note that the initial query embed-\nding (the ﬁrst column) produces an equivocal keypoint dis-\ntribution. There exists confusion of keypoint locations in\nthe ﬁrst several layers of decoder, yet as the decoder layer\ngoes deeper, the reﬁnement proceeds and eventually yields\na salient keypoint probability map (the last column).\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have presented Pose Regression TRans-\nformer (PRTR), a new design for regression-based multi-\nperson pose recognition method based on the Transformer\nstructure [33, 3]. It treats the pose recognition task as a\nregression task, removes complex pre/post-processing pro-\ncedures and requires fewer heuristic designs compared with\nexisting heatmap-based approaches. Our method includes\ntwo alternatives, one as a two-stage and the other an end-to-\nend one. PRTR achieves state-of-the-art performance com-\npared with other existing regression-based methods on the\nchallenging COCO dataset. Distribution and reﬁnement vi-\nsualization of keypoint queries blazes the trail of revealing\nTransformer decoder inner mechanisms. In the future, we\nwould like to investigate more powerful backbone networks\nand combine regression-based human detection and pose\nrecognition in a more ﬂexible manner.\nReferences\n[1] Mykhaylo Andriluka, Leonid Pishchulin, Peter Gehler, and\nBernt Schiele. 2d human pose estimation: New benchmark\nand state of the art analysis.
