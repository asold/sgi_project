BMC Bioinformatics           (2024) 25:79 \nprocedures. The average cost of bringing a new drug to market exceeds about 2 billion \ndollars and 10–15 years before it can reach the pharmacy shelf [1–3]. Therefore, finding \nnew indications for existing drugs, also known as drug repositioning, is an economically \nviable and time-saving strategy [4, 5]. Computational methods for drug repositioning \nfacilitate the identification of potential drug–disease associations by screening large-\nscale data sources, enabling more rational design of clinical trials. Such strategies can \naccelerate the drug discovery pipeline and increase the availability of new treatments [6].\nThe utilization of computational methods for drug repositioning in drug discovery \nhas become widespread [7, 8]. During this time, a growing array of methodologies has \nemerged. For example, methods rooted in matrix decomposition, like the one by Cui \net al. [9] utilize dual-network  L2,1-collaborative matrix factorization for predicting novel \ndrug–disease interactions. Fu et al. [10] introduced MFLDA, a method that decomposes \nheterogeneous data sources’ matrices into low-rank forms using matrix tri-factorization, \nthus exploring and exploiting their inherent and shared structure. MFLDA facilitates \nthe selection and integration of these data sources by assigning varying weights to each \nsource. Matrix factorization diminishes data dimensionality by transforming matrices \ninto low-rank structures, extracting crucial features and patterns. However, with exten -\nsive or densely high-dimensional matrices, its computational demands might become \nexcessive, resulting in reduced efficacy in managing considerable noise.\nNetwork-based drug repositioning models have emerged to confront this challenge, \nstriving to capitalize on intricate relational networks among biological entities such as \ndrugs and diseases. These models amalgamate varied information sources, encompass -\ning protein–protein interaction networks, gene expression data, and drug compound \ninformation, to anticipate potential novel drug–disease associations. For instance, \nZhang et al. [11] proposed NTSIM to predict unobserved drug–disease associations and \nextended it to NTSIM-C for classifying therapeutic associations. Zhang et al. [12] pro -\nposed SCMFDD, projecting drug–disease associations into two low-rank spaces, reveal -\ning latent features, and introducing feature-based similarity and semantic constraints. \nLu et al. [13] proposed heterogeneous information network (HIN) based model, namely \nHINGRL. Zhou et al. [14] introduced NEDD, using varied-length metapaths to explic -\nitly capture internal relationships within drugs and diseases and obtain low-dimen -\nsional representation vectors. Martínez et al. [15] developed DrugNet, a network-based \nmethod predicting new drug uses and treatments for diseases. It utilizes a heterogene -\nous network formed from disease, drug, and target information, identifying novel asso -\nciations by information propagation.\nDespite the commendable interpretability inherent in network-based methodologies, \ntheir performance is deemed unsatisfactory. However, the drug–disease association \nnetwork naturally has a graph structure, which enables techniques that leverage graph \nneural networks to adeptly preserve essential information, eliminate noise, and extract \npivotal patterns and features. Therefore, this enhances the accuracy of information avail-\nable for prediction and analysis in graph-based data scenarios. Some methods have been \nproposed to exploit the advantages of graph neural networks for drug–disease associa -\ntion prediction. Yu et al. [16] proposed LAGCN, a method that integrates heterogene -\nous networks, employs graph convolutional operations, and incorporates an attention \nmechanism. Yang et  al. [17] introduced a model that infers drug–disease associations \nPage 3 of 18\nHe et al. BMC Bioinformatics           (2024) 25:79 \n \nby applying network-embedding algorithms alongside a random forest classification \napproach. Gu et al. [18] introduced REDDA, a heterogeneous graph neural network with \nthree attention mechanisms for sequential drug disease representation learning. Wu \net al. [19] proposed EMP-SVD, a novel framework that predicts drug–disease associa -\ntions by integrating multiple meta-paths and singular value decomposition. Li et al. [20]. \nproposed the NIMCGCN method, which integrates Graph Convolutional Networks \n(GCN) with Neural Inductive Matrix Completion (NIMC) models to discover associ -\nations between miRNA and diseases. VGAE [21]. introduced by Kipf et  al., is a graph \nneural network model based on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, which \nmodels node features through an encoder-decoder structure, mapping them to a latent \nspace distribution. Meng et al. [22] leveraged deep learning within a heterogeneous net -\nwork framework to identify potential drugs related to diseases. Their model, DRWBNCF, \nemploys weighted bilinear graph convolution operations, intricately fusing information \nabout drug–disease associations and drug–disease similarity networks. Tang et al. [23] \nproposed the DRGBCN model, which exploits the embedding of graph convolutional \nlayers and local interactions between drugs and diseases, thus significantly improving \nthe accuracy and reliability of predictions. Ghasemian et al. [24] applied meta-learning \nmethods in network analysis to develop a stacked model that integrates complex predic -\ntion algorithms from various domains, effectively mitigating changes in link prediction. \nAdditionally, many studies [25, 26] have indicated that collaborative drug combination \nprediction is widely applied in drug repositioning. For instance, the SNRMPACDC \nmodel proposed by Li et al. [27] combines Siamese convolutional networks and random \nmatrix projection to predict collaborative combinations of anticancer drugs. NLLSS [28] \nis a semi-supervised learning-based model that focuses on predicting collaborative drug \ncombinations, enhancing the model’s predictive performance through methods involv -\ning non-negative low-rank and sparse structures. They play a crucial role in revealing the \nassociations between drugs and biomolecules, as well as in drug repositioning.\nAlthough these methods can extract edge information through extensive informat -\nics learning, they often struggle to fully mine the complex interactions between nodes \nin heterogeneous graphs, which may affect the accuracy of predictions. To address \nthese challenges, we propose a heterogeneous information graph representation \nlearning method for predicting drug–disease associations, named WMAGT, which \nutilizes weighted multi-aggregate graph convolutional network and graph trans -\nformer to exploit discriminative node representations. The workflow of the proposed \nmethod is demonstrated in Fig.  1. Specifically, the proposed WMAGT approach \nfirst integrates drug–drug similarity networks, disease–disease similarity networks, \nand validated drug–disease association networks to construct a comprehensive het -\nerogeneous information network. Then, graph transformer combined with weighted \nmulti-aggregate graph convolutional neural network are used to learn efficient char -\nacterizations of drugs and diseases from this heterogeneous information network. \nPrior to the predictor, we integrated domain embeddings and interaction embeddings \nthrough neural collaborative filtering for the final link prediction scoring. To evaluate \nthe performance of the proposed method, we cross-validated the predictive perfor -\nmance of WMAGT on three benchmark datasets and compared it with four state-\nof-the-art methods while conducting ablation experiments. Experimental results \nPage 4 of 18He et al. BMC Bioinformatics           (2024) 25:79 \nprovide strong evidence of the effectiveness of WMAGT in discovering drug indica -\ntions, which is important for advancing drug repurposing and reducing adverse drug \nreactions in the field of drug discovery. The main contributions and advantages of \nWMAGT include:\n1. Proposing a representation learning method based on heterogeneous information \ngraphs, which fully utilizes the multi-source information of drugs and diseases and \nconsiders their multi-level relationships.\n2. Adopting a representation learning framework of Graph Transformer and Weighted \nMulti-Aggregation Graph Convolutional Neural Network, effectively eliminating the \nimpact of heterogeneity and capturing relationships to learn more effective node rep-\nresentations.\n3. Demonstrating through experiments on three public datasets that this method has \nbroad application prospects in the field of drug discovery. Our approach not only \noutperforms existing models in predictive performance but also shows significant \nimprovement in understanding complex biological networks.\nMethods\nIn this study, we propose a novel computational method, WMAGT, for drug repo -\nsitioning, aiming to discover new indications for existing drugs by inferring potential \ndrug–disease associations. First, we build a heterogeneous network that incorporates \nvarious types of relations in the data set, such as drug–drug similarity network, disease–\ndisease similarity network, and drug–disease association network. Then, we utilize an \nend-to-end model to learn the latent features of the network and predict the unknown \nassociations.\nFig. 1 The overall architecture of the proposed WMAGT. WMAGT involves three main steps. First, drug \nand disease similarity networks are jointly encoded using GCN and graph transformer for representation \nprojection. In the second step, matrix operations project drug and disease representations in the network, \ngenerating new information. Lastly, the domain information from the first step and interactive information \nfrom the second step are utilized in the NCF module, and multiple loss functions along with MLP are \nemployed to comprehensively model the drug–disease relationship\nPage 5 of 18\nHe et al. BMC Bioinformatics           (2024) 25:79 \n \nBenchmark datasets\nTo explore heterogeneous network prediction methods for drug–disease associations, we \nutilized three publicly available real datasets to assess the efficacy of our model. The first \ndataset, Fdataset [29], comprises 313 diseases from the OMIM database [30] and 553 drugs \nfrom the DrugBank database [ 31], along with 1933 known associations between them. \nAnother dataset, termed as Cdataset [32], consists of 663 drugs from the DrugBank data-\nbase and 409 diseases from the OMIM database, encompassing 2532 established associa-\ntions between drugs and diseases. The third dataset is LRSSL [ 33], which comprises 763 \ndrugs from the DrugBank database, 681 diseases from the MeSH database, and a collection \nof 3051 validated associations between drugs and diseases. The essential statistical informa-\ntion of these three datasets is presented in Table 1.\nThe construction of heterogeneous information graph\nTo predict potential drug–disease associations, this research employed network analysis \nmethods based on a known drug–disease association network denoted as G. G is repre-\nsented by an n × m binary matrix A, where n and m represent the number of drugs and dis-\neases, respectively. The matrix Aij holds a value of 1 or 0, indicating the presence or absence \nof an experimentally validated association between drug ri and disease dj.\nTwo additional similarity networks were constructed: a drug–drug similarity network Gr \nand a disease–disease similarity network Gd. These networks are represented by n × n and \nm × m matrices Ar and Ad, respectively. The values Ar(i, j) and Ad(i, j) represent the similari-\nties between drug ri and drug rj, and between disease di and disease dj, respectively. These \nsimilarities were computed based on various characteristics including chemical, pharmaco-\nlogical, therapeutic, phenotypic, genetic, and environmental properties of drugs or diseases.\nTo enhance accuracy and reduce noise, a k-nearest neighbor approach was employed. \nIt considered only the k most similar neighbors for each drug or disease. The extended \nk-nearest neighbor sets of drugs or diseases, represented as ˜Nk , comprised the individual \nentities along with their k nearest neighbors. Ar(i, j) and Ad(i, j) illustrate the similarities \namong drugs or diseases, considering their extended k-nearest neighbor sets ˜Nk . Mathe-\nmatical representation:\n(1)G = (Aij)n×m\n(2)G r = (A r i, j )n×n\n(3)G d = (Ad\n(\ni, j\n)\n)m ×m\nTable 1 Details of the three benchmark datasets\nDatasets Drugs Diseases Associations\nFdataset 593 313 1933\nCdataset 663 409 2532\nLRSSL 763 681 3051\nPage 6 of 18He et al. BMC Bioinformatics           (2024) 25:79 \nConsidering two sets representing drugs (R) and diseases (D), where each r ∈ R and \nd ∈ D introduces an association label Y r,d signifying the presence Y r,d = 1 or absence \nYr,d = 0 of an association between drug r and disease d. Consequently, inferring the asso -\nciation label Yr,d for a given drug r and disease d relies on known associations within the \nsets. The expression for the association label Yr,d remains defined as:\nThis representation aims to establish the foundation of the drug repositioning prob -\nlem, framing it as a task of predicting association labels.\nGraph convolutional network module\nIn a drug–disease heterogenous graph, nodes represent various drugs and diseases. Typ-\nically, each node contains its own similarity information, and the edges connecting two \nnodes represent the relationship between them. We employ Graph Convolutional Net -\nworks (GCN) [34–37] to integrate node information, which usually consists of aggrega -\ntion functions and update functions. Aggregation functions are applied to each node/\nedge to gather information from their neighbors, while update functions generate new \nrepresentations for each node/edge based on the collected information and the previous \nrepresentation. The update function is defined as follows:\nHere, H(l) represents the input features at layer l in the GCN. H(l+1) signifies the output \nfeatures at layer l + 1 after the convolution operation. σ is the activation function (com -\nmonly ReLU or Leaky ReLU). W (l) is the learnable weight matrix at layer. ˜A = A + In \nrepresents the adjacency matrix of the graph, where A is the original adjacency matrix, \nand In is the identity matrix. ˜D is the diagonal node degree matrix of ˜A.\nNode attentions in graph transformer module\nRecently, the Transformer model has extended its application beyond the field of natu -\nral language processing to include a wide range of tasks, including link prediction. In \nthe information integration module, we have incorporated both the graph transformer \n[38–41] and GCN, thereby enhancing the model’s flexibility and performance. The two \nfundamental components of the Transformer are the dot-product attention mechanism \nand the feedforward network, playing crucial roles in link prediction tasks.\nThe graph attention formula is:\nwhere h (l)\nj  is the i-th node’s feature vector in layer l, W(l) is the layer’s weight matrix, n is \nthe graph size, and α(l)\nij  is the attention weight between nodes i and j in layer l, computed \nby\n(4)Y r,d =\n{\n1 if r is associated with d\n0 otherwise\n(5)H (l+1) = σ\n(\n˜D−1\n2 ˜A ˜D−1\n2 H (l)W (l)\n)\n(6)h(l+1)\ni =\nn∑\nj=1\nα(l)\nij W (l)h(l)\nj\nPage 7 of 18\nHe et al. BMC Bioinformatics           (2024) 25:79 \n \nwhere e (l)\nij  is the similarity between nodes i and j in layer l, computed by:\nwhere a(l) is a differentiable similarity function in layer l, such as dot product, bilinear, \nmultilayer perceptron, etc.\nLayer-wise transformation At each layer of the Graph Transformer, the hidden states \nof nodes are updated using multi-head self-attention and feedforward neural networks. \nThe transformation can be summarized as [42]:\nAggregation across heads The outputs from multiple attention heads are aggregated to \nobtain the final node representations:\nwhere H represents the number of attention heads.\nOverview of the proposed WMAGT model\nAs shown in Fig.  1, this section will delve into the detailed description of the model, \ndelineating its architecture, methodologies employed, and the intricate components \ncontributing to its predictive capability.\nGraph representation learning with mixed aggregation parameters\nIn the context of learning node neighborhood information, a hybrid approach is \nemployed utilizing mixed parameters, integrating two distinct graph convolution opera -\ntions to acquire meaningful representations of graph data. The fundamental idea of \nhybrid parameters involves a weighted combination of the outputs of two graph convo -\nlution operations, thereby generating the final node features.\nhere, α and β control the relative influence of the two aggregation methods. The Recti -\nfied Linear Unit function (ReLU) [43] is employed as activation function, while Pool rep -\nresents a customized pooling operation involving specific manipulations of the \nadjacency matrix. This process involves the product of the adjacency matrix and node \nfeature matrix, square operations, and some matrix operations. The entire operation can \nbe expressed mathematically as follows: Z = (A · XW) 2−\n(\nA2⊙ XW 2\n)\n . Here, A is the \nadjacency matrix of the graph, XW is the node feature matrix, and Z represents the new \nnode representation matrix obtained after the graph pooling operation.\n(7)α(l)\nij =\nexp\n(\ne(l)\nij\n)\n∑ n\nk =1 exp\n(\ne(l)\nik\n)\n(8)e(l)\nij = a(l)\n(\nW (l)h(l)\ni , W (l)h(l)\nj\n)\n(9)h (l)\ni = MultiHeadAttention\n(\nh (l−1)\ni\n)\n+ FeedForward\n(\nh (l−1)\ni\n)\n(10)h(l)\ni = concat\n(\nh(l,1)\ni ,h(l,2)\ni ,... ,h(l,H )\ni\n)\n(11)out= β · ReLU (Pool(XW ,A)) + α · ReLU\n(\n˜D− 1\n2 ˜A ˜D− 1\n2 XW\n)\nPage 8 of 18He et al. BMC Bioinformatics           (2024) 25:79 \nThis operation introduces additional information into the graph structure, aiming to \nbetter capture the relationships between nodes. In general, the introduction of hybrid \nparameters imparts adaptability to the model, allowing it to determine the relative con -\ntributions of different graph convolution operations during the learning process and \nthus better adapt to diverse graph structures.\nComputing weighted matrices for drug and disease nodes\nTo compute the weighted matrices for drugs and diseases, we utilize the input feature \nmatrix X ∈ RN ×d , where N represents the number of nodes and d denotes the feature \ndimension. The weight matrix, denoted as W ∈ Rd×d′\n , corresponds to the output feature \ndimension d′. The graph’s adjacency matrix, A ∈{ 0, 1}N×N , demonstrates connections \nbetween nodes in a symmetric matrix form. The weighted feature matrix is obtained \nfrom this process, which can be represented as:\nthe iterative graph convolution concludes with the normalization of the resulting feature \nmatrix using a normalization matrix represented as:\nFurthermore, an element-wise addition of a bias term is performed to further refine the \noutput matrix.\nCompute the element‑wise product of drug and disease embeddings\nGiven an input drug embedding matrix as D ∈ RN drug×d , and a Disease Embedding \nmatrix as E ∈ RN disease×d , where Ndrug and N disease represent the quantities of drugs and \ndiseases respectively, and d represents the embedding dimension.\nProjection of Drug and Disease via Linear Mapping:\nthis involves computing the element-wise product of drug and disease embeddings. For \ninstance, let Dij represent the row and jth column element of matrix D, and E ij represent \nthe ith row and jth column element of matrix E. The element-wise product P can be \nobtained as: Pij= D ij× Eij . The resulting matrix P captures the element-wise products \nof the drug and disease embeddings. This process facilitates the exploration of interac -\ntions between drugs and diseases within a feature space defined by their embeddings.\nTo normalize the association matrix P ,  L2 normalization is applied row-wise post ele -\nment-wise product computation. Each row’s  L2 norm is computed, and its elements are \ndivided by this norm, ensuring unit  L2 norm per row. The normalization formula is: \nPnormij= Pij√\n/Sigma1N\nk=1P 2\nik\n , Where N denotes the column count, and the summation extends \n(12)\nXW = X· W\n(13)\nout = norm · out\n(14)out = out + self.bias\n(15)y = x1 · P1\n(16)y = x2 · P2\nPage 9 of 18\nHe et al.

This yields a matrix P normij with standardized rows, enhancing \nassociation representation and minimizing dataset bias.\nNeural collaborative filtering for drug and disease expression\nNeural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) [44] is a neural network-based collaborative fil -\ntering algorithm designed for learning relationships between users and items for \nrecommendation purposes. The implementation of NCF in our model involves key com-\nponents: Neighbor Embedding Process, defines the neighbor embedding process, and \nintegrating information from neighbors of drugs and diseases to better capture relation -\nships between nodes. Interaction Embedding Process, defines the interaction informa -\ntion between drugs and diseases. This section mainly involves calculating interaction \nembedding through element-wise multiplication and normalization operations. Decod -\ning Process, defines the decoder, transforming embedded node representations into final \nprediction scores. This process primarily involves linear transformations and non-linear \nactivation functions.\nIn summary, in the forward method of the model, node embedding representations \nare first obtained through processes such as neighbor embedding and interaction \nembedding. Subsequently, the decoder yields the final prediction scores. The core idea \nof Neural Collaborative Filtering involves learning implicit relationships between drugs \nand diseases through processes such as embedding, neighbor embedding, interaction \nembedding, and decoding.\nNeighbor‑weighted interaction decoding\nIn this module, the descriptions of drug–disease associations, drug proximity, and dis -\nease proximity are amalgamated into a unified vector ˜hr,d using the concatenation opera-\ntion ⊕ , defined as:\nHere, the operator ⊕ signifies concatenation, facilitating the formation of an encom -\npassing representation that merges established associations with contextual information \ndrawn from drug and disease proximities.\nSubsequently, linear transformations and ReLU activation were utilized in processing \nthe hidden layers. In each hidden layer i where i ranges from 1 to the length of hidden_\ndims, the use of linear transformations and ReLU activation generated zi. Afterwards, at \nthe output layer, linear transformations and Sigmoid activation were applied to handle \nthe outputs from the hidden layer zlen(hidden_dims) , producing the output y. The overall \nmodel output Y can be interpreted as probabilities for specific categories.\nMLP‑based prediction\nThe introduction of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is motivated by its ability to capture \nintricate nonlinear relationships, extract advanced features, manage sparse data, and \nexhibit a flexible architecture adaptable to various data traits. Within drug–disease \nassociation studies, integrating MLP aims to enhance the accurate prediction and inter -\npretation of complex drug–disease associations, thereby providing deeper insights into \ncorrelation studies within the pharmaceutical domain.\n(17)˜hr,d = hr,d ⊕ hr,d ⊕ ˜hr ⊕ ˜hd\nPage 10 of 18He et al. BMC Bioinformatics           (2024) 25:79 \nForward propagation in an MLP involves multiple layers, each with numerous neurons. \nAssuming inputs X, H neurons in the hidden layer, output Y , weight parameters W, and \nbiases b, the forward propagation can be represented as:\nParameters setting\nHyperparameter settings are crucial for fine-tuning the neural collaborative filtering model, \ncovering dimensions like node embedding, neighbor embedding, and decoder hidden \nlayers. Specifically, the node embedding dimension is set at 64, the neighbor embedding \ndimension at 32, and the decoder hidden layer dimension is specified as (64, 32). The learn-\ning rate is set to 5e − 4, and the dropout rate is 0.3. Additionally, a comprehensive set of \nloss functions is utilized, encompassing binary cross-entropy loss, focal loss, mean squared \nerror loss, and ranking loss. For the focal loss, parameters are configured with α set to 0.5 \nand γ set to 2.0. The graph transformer network parameter is defined as λ = 0.8. Through-\nout the training process, a holistic consideration of these loss functions is conducted, aim-\ning to comprehensively optimize the model. These configurations are designed to strike \na balance between model complexity and performance, ensuring optimal predictive out -\ncomes across diverse facets.\nLoss Function Formula:\nHere, α controls the balance of weights between positive and negative samples, and γ \nregulates the focus of the focal loss. We use the Adam [45] optimizer to update model \nparameters, ensuring efficient training. A cyclic learning rate scheduler dynamically \nadjusts the learning rate, enhancing training effectiveness. Additionally, the model \nincorporates two graph neural network layers (Graph Transformer and Graph Convolu -\ntion Network), employing different neighbor sampling quantities during training.\nEvaluation metrics\nWe adopted six widely used indicators to measure the predictive performance of the pro-\nposed model, including accuracy (Acc), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR), \nArea Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), F1 score, Precision and \nRecall. Since AUPR and F1 are more sensitive to severe imbalances data. Micro metrics are \nused for AUPR and AUC, while macro metrics are used for other measurements. The defi-\nnitions of these indicators can be described as follows:\n(18)Y = σ\n(\nW output · σ (W hidden · X + bhidden) + boutput\n)\n(19)Focal Loss =− α · (1 − p)γ · log(p)\n(20)Acc= TP + TN\nTN + TP + FN + FP\n(21)precision= TP\nTP + FP\nPage 11 of 18\nHe et al. BMC Bioinformatics           (2024) 25:79 \n \nwhere the TN , PN, FN and FP  denote the number of correctly predicted positive and \nnegative samples, wrongly predicted positive and negative samples, respectively. In addi-\ntion, we use the Micro mode to calculate AUC and Recall, which treats each element \nof the label indicator matrix as a label. In contrast, F1 calculates each label in a Macro \nmode and finds their unweighted average.\nBaseline methods\nNIMCGCN [20]. This study introduces a novel approach named Neural Inductive \nMatrix Completion with Graph Convolutional Network (NIMCGCN), amalgamat -\ning Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Neural Inductive Matrix Completion \n(NIMC) models to forecast the association between miRNAs and diseases. By optimiz -\ning parameters through supervised learning and demonstrating its superiority in predic -\ntion accuracy and forecasting new diseases during experimental validation, the method \nserves as an effective computational tool for swiftly identifying disease-associated \nmiRNAs.\nDRWBNCF [22]. This study introduces a new method called DRWBNCF for drug \nrepositioning, addressing limitations of traditional latent factor models. Leveraging \ndeep learning techniques and a heterogeneous network framework, DRWBNCF infers \npotential drugs for diseases. By amalgamating drug–disease association information \nand drug–disease similarity networks, employing a weighted bilinear graph convolution \noperation, and utilizing a multi-layer perceptron combined with α-balanced focal loss \nfunction and graph regularization, DRWBNCF demonstrates effectiveness in predicting \nunknown drug–disease associations.\nGhasemian ‘s model [24]. Ghasemian et al. employed a meta-learning approach within \nnetwork analysis to devise a stacked model, amalgamating various sophisticated predic -\ntion algorithms. This approach successfully mitigated the variations observed in link \nprediction across diverse domains of networks.\nVAGE [21]. Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (VGAE) is a graph neural network \nmodel built upon the framework of Variational Autoencoders (VAE). VGAE integrates \nthe encoder-decoder structure of VAE, modeling node features into latent space distri -\nbutions and reconstructing them back to the original feature space. Key features include \nprobabilistic modeling, representing node embeddings as Gaussian distributions using \nreparameterization techniques and KL divergence, while also considering graph struc -\nture through graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to efficiently capture local structural \ninformation.\nDRGBCN [23]. DRGBCN presents an approach that utilizes bilinear attention net -\nworks and local interactive learning to improve performance in drug repositioning tasks. \nSignificant performance gains are achieved by emphasizing local association and deep \nlearning applications in the medical domain.\n(22)Recall= TP\nTP + FN\n(23)F 1 = 2 × precision× recall\nprecision+ recall\nPage 12 of 18He et al.

In this regard, WMAGT dem-\nonstrated relatively superior average performance in both AUROC and AUPR, high -\nlighting its effectiveness across various datasets. After statistical testing and analysis, \nthe proposed WMAGT shows significant performance improvement compared to com -\npared models.\nAblation study\nIn this section, we delve deeply into the far-reaching impacts of two pivotal modules on \nour experimental framework:\n• ’w/o Transformer’: Our investigation goes beyond, scrutinizing the specific effects of \nexcluding the transformer mechanism on model performance. This involves under -\nstanding how the model handles information, learns representations, and ultimately \npredicts drug–disease relationships.\n• ’w/o NCF’: Further discourse is dedicated to the model’s performance in the absence \nof collaborative filtering. This decision plays a crucial role in determining the model’s \neffectiveness in handling user-item associations, particularly in our specific applica -\ntion scenario.\nIn WMAGT model, we employed a simplified approach, omitting the steps of neigh -\nbor embedding and interaction embedding, directly feeding the node representations \nobtained from the graph convolution module into the decoder. The rationale behind this \ndecision and its implications on model performance necessitate a broader contextual \nunderstanding. The results of the ablation study in Fig.  5 showcase the consequences of \nthese decisions. Notably, both the transformer module and the NCF module contrib -\nute significantly to enhancing the performance in predicting drug–disease relationships, \nwith the NCF module being particularly noteworthy. This indicates that, when consid -\nering multiple embeddings and the transformer comprehensively, the model can more \naccurately capture latent relationships between drugs and diseases, thereby improving \nthe predictive accuracy of drug–disease relationships. This finding provides profound \ninsights for future model optimization and further research endeavors.\nCase study\nTo assess the practical applicability of WMAGT, a case study was conducted with the \naim of predicting drug candidates for Parkinson’s disease. Specifically, the model was \ntrained using all known drug–disease associations in the F dataset, and a descending \norder ranking was performed after obtaining the probabilities of all drug–disease asso -\nciations. In this process, the top 10 drug candidates associated with Parkinson’s disease \nwere selected for in-depth investigation. Parkinson’s disease is a chronic neurological \ndisorder typically characterized by symptoms such as movement disorders, muscle stiff -\nness, and tremors. The primary cause of this disease is the loss of dopamine-produc -\ning neurons in the brain, where dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter controlling \nmovement. Currently, the treatment focus for Parkinson’s disease primarily revolves \naround alleviating symptoms, and the exploration of new drug treatment directions has \nPage 15 of 18\nHe et al. BMC Bioinformatics           (2024) 25:79 \n \nbeen a crucial area of scientific research. Encouragingly, the relevance of seven of these \ndrugs was further confirmed by additional literature, as depicted in Table  3. This dis -\ncovery not only enhances the reliability of our model but also indicates that WMAGT \nsuccessfully identifies potential drug–disease pairs by learning multi-source information \nabout drugs and diseases.\nConclusions\nIn this study, we propose a heterogenous information graph-based method for predict -\ning drug–disease associations, named WMAGT. WMAGT innovatively integrates Graph \nTransformer Networks and Neural Collaborative Filtering, with a core improvement \nlying in the deep aggregation of local neighbors around nodes to enhance traditional \nFig. 5 The performance of WMAGT and other variants under tenfold cross-validation on three benchmark \ndatasets\nPage 16 of 18He et al.

Simultaneously, the model autonomously learns to select \nweights for different types of convolutional networks, resulting in a significant perfor -\nmance improvement compared to a singular graph convolution network. Extensive experi-\nments were conducted to thoroughly assess the performance and robustness of WMAGT. \nWMAGT exhibited superior performance on three benchmark datasets, better than other \ncompared state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies further verified the importance of dif-\nferent modules introduced in the proposed framework. In addition, the case study show \nthat WMAGT has high practical predictive power, e.g., in Parkinson’s potential drug min-\ning, 7 of the top 10 drugs we predicted have been relevantly demonstrated. This study not \nonly introduces methodological refinements but also substantiates their feasibility and \nsuperiority through rigorous experimentation and empirical validation. It’s anticipated that \nthese results can serve as valuable references for fostering further drug development and \ndisease treatment.\nAuthor contributions\nS.-H.H. and L.-J.Y. conceived the algorithm, carried out analyses, prepared the data sets, carried out experiments, and \nwrote the manuscript.
