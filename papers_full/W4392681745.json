    "abstract": "This research project focuses on enhancing student teachers communication skills, particularly for prospective teachers, using digital learning tools and framing communication accordingly to Habermas` differentiation of strategic and understanding-oriented communicative action.Specifically, we conducted an experimental study to compare the effectiveness of avatar-based versus video-camera-based interactions in training communication skills.Our findings suggest that the avatar-based approach may be more effective in some aspects than the other.Building up on these results, we are planning to develop an AI agent as a facilitator.This agent will provide feedback and guidance to prospective teachers to support the development of their communication skills.Overall, this research project aims to contribute to the field of teacher education by exploring the potential of digital learning tools to enhance communication skills training.",
