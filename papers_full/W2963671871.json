It in-\nvolves building a neural network based language model (known asneural language\nmodel (NLM) [1]) given a set of training text token sequences and then using the\nlearned model to produce texts similar to the training data. With the development\nof deep learning algorithms, neural text generation has become an indispensable\ntechnique in the natural language processing ﬁeld as it can generate more ﬂuent and\nsemantically meaningful text than conventional methods [2]. Its application mainly\nincludes machine translation [3], image captioning [4], text summarization [5], dia-\nlogue generation [6], and speech recognition [7].\narXiv:1907.09177v2  [cs.CL]  3 Dec 2019\nAdelani et. al.\nReviews:\nGood …\nVery cheap and nice …\nI like this shirt …\nVery bad purchase experience.

A review with the desired sentiment (positive or neg-\native here) is taken from the target shopping website automatically and input to a fake review\ngenerator to produce a large number of fake reviews with the same sentiment.\nHigh-performance NLMs can also be used to generate fake reviews, fake com-\nments, and fake news. The generated fake reviews, fake comments, or fake news can\nthen be used to attack online systems or fool human readers. For example, a review\nsystem can be ﬂooded with positive reviews to increase a company’s proﬁt [8] or\nwith negative reviews to reduce a competitor’s proﬁt, and fake comments/news can\nbe posted on social websites for political beneﬁts. Previous work [9, 10] demon-\nstrated the feasibility of fake review attacks. However, because these methods apply\nbasic language models (LMs) and take some keywords or meta information as in-\nput, post-processing was needed to adjust the contents to match the desired topic.\nThis means that professional experts are needed to train a high performance LM and\ndesign an additional language processing method. It is, therefore, interesting and is\nalso more risky if a threat model with low-skilled but high-performance LM can be\neasily built. We hypothesize that this could be feasible since there are many state-\nof-the-art pre-trained high-performance LMs shared on the Internet for reproducing\nthe experimental results in the literature. With such publicly available LMs, it is\npossible for non-experts to build powerful threat models. In this work, we show an\nexample of such threat models and evaluate human- and machine-based detection.\nFigure 1 shows the threat model proposed in our investigation. We suppose that\nan attacker is able to access reviews (or comments) on a website (e.g., a shopping\nwebsite) and use a method to automatically identify reviews with a desired senti-\nment (i.e., positive or negative in this work). We also suppose that the attacker can\naccess a large database containing real reviews (written by people) to train an LM\nfor automatic text generation. The attacker then inputs the identiﬁed reviews to the\nLM to generate a large number of fake reviews. The generated reviews that have\nthe same sentiment as the original review are selected to a fake review pool. Since\nthe fake reviews are generated on the basis of an original review, the context of the\noriginal review (e.g., an Italian restaurant) should be implicitly embedded in them.\nFinally, the attacker submits the selected fake reviews to the site to increase or de-\ncrease the rating of a product, service, etc.\nTo generate sentiment-preserved fake reviews, we use a pre-trained GPT-2 NLM [11],\nwhich is able to generate length variable, ﬂuent, meaningful sentences, to generate\nGeneration and Detection of Fake Online Reviews\nreviews and then use a ﬁne-tuned text classiﬁer based on BERT [12] to ﬁlter out\nundesired-sentiment reviews. Since GPT-2 training data differs from the data used\nin our experiment (i.e., Amazon reviews [13] and Yelp reviews [14]), it may gener-\nate reviews with irrelevant topic. We solved this problem by adapting the original\nGPT-2 model to the two databases we used. Subjective evaluation with 80 partic-\nipants demonstrated that the fake reviews generated by our method had the same\nﬂuency as those written by people. It also demonstrated that it was difﬁcult for the\nparticipants to identify fake reviews given that they tended to randomly identify fake\nreviews as the one most likely to be the real review. Automatic detection with three\ncountermeasures, Grover [15], GLTR for detecting text generated by an LM [16],\nand OpenAI GPT-2 detector [17], was also investigated. The results reveal that auto-\nmatic detection has better performance than humans, but, the accuracy of detection\nof the fake reviews is far from perfect and has signiﬁcant room for improvements.\n2 Related Work\nThe most common attack on online review systems is a crowdturﬁng attack [18, 19]\nwhereby a bad actor recruits a group of workers to write fake reviews based on a\nspeciﬁed topic for a speciﬁed context and then submits them to the target website.\nSince this method has an economic cost, it is typically limited to large-scale attacks.\nAutomated crowdturﬁng, in which machine learning algorithms are used to gener-\nate fake review, is a less expensive and more efﬁcient way to attack online review\nsystems.\nYao et al. [9] proposed such an attack method. Their idea is to ﬁrst generate\nan initial fake review based on a given keyword using a long short-term memory\n(LSTM)-based LM. Because the initial fake review is stochastically sampled from a\nlearned distribution, it may be irrelevant to the desired context. Then speciﬁc nouns\nin the fake review are replaced with ones that better ﬁt the desired context. Juuti et\nal. [10] proposed a similar method for generating fake reviews that further requires\nadditional meta information such as shop name, location, rating, and etc.\nOur method differs from these methods in that we use a whole review as the seed\nfor generating a large number of fake reviews without using additional information\nor additional processing and then ﬁlter out the ones without the desired sentiment.\nOur method is thus more straightforward. We do not modify the generated reviews,\nso their ﬂuency is close to that of the training samples. Since the LM used is adapted\nfrom a pre-trained model, our method can be easily implemented even by low-skill\nattackers.\nIn addition, adversarial text examples can also be used for attacking online review\nsystems [20, 21]. The aim is to deceive text classiﬁers, not people, by adding small\nperturbations to the input. Unlike this type of method, fake reviews generated by\nour method are aimed at changing overall user impressions.\n3 Fake review generation\nThe most important part of the proposed method for generating sentiment-preserving\nfake reviews is the GPT-2 text generation model [11]. Details of our method are as\nbelow.\nAdelani et. al.\n3.1 GPT-2 Model\nThe task of an LM is to estimate the probability distribution of a text corpus or to\nestimate the probability of the next token conditioned on the context tokens. Given a\nsequence of tokens x = (x1, ...,xT ), the probability of the sequence can be factorized\nas\nP(x) =\nT\n∏\nt=1\nP(xt |x1, ...,xt−1). (1)\nThis probability is approximated by learning the conditional probability of each\ntoken given a ﬁxed number of k-context tokens by using a neural network with\nparameters Θ. The tokens used for training can be of different granularities such as\nword [22], character [23], sub-word unit [24], or hybrid word-character [25]. The\nobjective function of the LM is to maximize the sum of the logs of the conditional\nprobabilities over a sequence of tokens:\nΘ∗= argmax\nΘ\nT\n∑\nt=1\nlogP(xt |xt−k, ...,xt−1;Θ). (2)\nThe neural network parameters Θ can be learned using various architectures such\nas a feed-forward neural network [22], a recurrent neural network (RNN) such\nas a vanilla RNN [26, 27], an LSTM [28] and its variants [29], and the trans-\nformer [30, 31] architectures. A GPT-2 model based on the transformer architecture\nhas the lowest perplexity on various language modeling datasets and it generates\nhigh-quality ﬂuent texts.\nThe GPT-2 model was trained on a large unlabeled dataset — 8 million webtexts\nobtained by scraping all outbound links (about 45 million) from Reddit, resulting in\nabout 40 GB of text. This LM is easily generalizable to a corpus for domains that\ndiffer from that of the original training data. For instance, the GPT-2 LM attained\nstate-of-the-art lower perplexity on seven out of eight tested datasets in a zero-shot\nsetting. In addition, generative pre-trained models such as GPT-2 aretransferable to\nmany natural language understanding tasks such as document classiﬁcation, ques-\ntion answering, and textual entailment through discriminative ﬁne-tuning of the\nmodels within a few epochs. Moreover, the GPT-2 LM can be adapted to a new\ndomain by ﬁne-tuning the model on a corpus in that domain, e.g., online reviews.\nThere are four different GPT-2 models in terms of size. We used the smallest\none (117 million parameters, Θ)1. As of now, they have released only the smaller\nmodels — 117M and 345M — to prevent the malicious use of their larger models.\nEven with the smallest one, we were able to generate realistic reviews.\n3.2 Sentiment-Preserving Fake Review Generation\nAs shown in Figure 2, we use a two-step approach to generating sentiment-preserved\nreviews: generation and validation. In the generation step, the attacker provides an\noriginal review x with a given sentiment as the seed text to the GPT-2 LM, which\nthen generates a different reviewx′based on x. We refer tox′as a fake review; it dif-\n1 https://github.com/openai/gpt-2\nGeneration and Detection of Fake Online Reviews\nGPT-2\nx:  seed review\nx′: generated review\nx x′\n1. Generation step 2.

There is no strict guarantee that the original\nreview and the fake review have the same context because x′is sampled from the\nprobability distribution represented by the model while the context information may\nbe implicitly embedded in x′to some degree. Therefore, part ofx′can be thought of\nas a continuation or paraphrase of x.\nValidation step aims to ﬁlter out the generated reviews with undesired sentiment.\nIn this step, the attacker determines whetherx′has the same sentiment as x by using\nthe BERT text classiﬁer [12], which is similar to the GPT-2 in that it is also based on\nthe transformer, but it further takes into account bidirectional context information.\nWe assume that the attacker has access to such a classiﬁer and uses it to quickly\ncheck the generated reviews for their sentiment. If the sentiment ofx′is the same as\nthat of x, it is added to the fake review pool. Otherwise it is discarded.\n3.3 Fine-tuning Language Model on Review Data\nOne major advantage of LMs like GPT-2 is that they are very easy to adapt (i.e., ﬁne-\ntune) to a new dataset or domain. During ﬁne-tuning, the model is ﬁrst initialized\nbefore training with the pre-trained parameters rather than random weights. Fine-\ntuning takes less time than training a high-capacity LM from scratch with millions\nof web documents. Furthermore, text classiﬁcation and other natural language un-\nderstanding tasks beneﬁt from pre-training the model on a large amount of unlabeled\ntext. It has been shown that ﬁne-tuning using labeled data after initializing the model\nwith pre-trained parameters improves accuracy for downstream tasks [12]. There-\nfore, we ﬁne-tuned both the GPT-2 LM and the BERT classiﬁer. We used Amazon\nand Yelp review databases containing both positive and negative reviews written in\nEnglish. Following the approach of Yang et al. [14], we divided the reviews in each\ndatabase into training and test datasets, as shown in Table 1. The model was ﬁne-\ntuned on each training dataset, and evaluation was performed on the respective test\ndataset.\nAdelani et. al.\nTable 2Example reviews generated using pre-trained GPT-2 LM.\nMethod Seed (from Amazon)/generated review\nOriginal Review (SEED) I currently live in europe, and this is the book I recommend for\nmy visitors. It covers many countries, colour pictures, and is a\nnice starter for before you go, and once you are there.\nPre-trained GPT-2 fake review\nJust as I recommend before you go. And there are lots more\nthings to read. What are your favourite books of the day? This\nis my take on the day before a work trip to\nFine-tuned GPT-2 fake review\nGreat for kids too. Recommended for all young people as the\npictures are good (my kid’s are 11) favourite books of the day?\nThis is my take on the day before a work trip\nAs of now, the authors of GPT-2 have not released the training code, but we\nfound a reliable source code2 on GitHub for training the GPT-2 model, which is the\nimplementation we used to ﬁne-tune the pre-trained model on the review databases.\nWe ﬁne-tuned the GPT-2 by concatenating all reviews with anewline symbol into a\ngiant text ﬁle; we did not distinguish between positive and negative reviews during\nﬁne-tuning. We ﬁne-tuned the 117M GPT-2 model on the Amazon training set for\ntwo weeks (485K epochs) and on the Yelp training set for ﬁve days (190K epochs)\nby using the default hyper-parameters. We stopped the training when the validation\nerror was no longer decreasing. We found that the pre-trained GPT-2 LM sometimes\nproduced texts that were not review-like, as shown in Table 2. Nevertheless, after\nﬁne-tuning, the generated texts were review-like.\nSimilarly, we ﬁne-tuned the BERT text classiﬁer on the Amazon and Yelp train-\ning sets for three epochs to classify reviews as positive or negative. We achieved\n96.2% accuracy on the original Amazon test dataset and 96 .0% accuracy on the\noriginal Yelp test dataset. Fine-tuning BERT took only a few hours, and the perfor-\nmance was better than that reported for the character-level CNN [14] (94 .49% for\nthe Amazon test dataset; 94.11 % for the Yelp test dataset).\n3.4 Explicit sentiment modeling\nIn addition to the above basic attack method, which simply ﬁne-tunes the pre-trained\nGPT-2 LM, we further propose a “skill-up” method in which an LM is explicitly\nconditioned by a speciﬁed sentiment. This method requires a natural language pro-\ncessing expert to train a tailored LM.\nRadford et al. [32] reported that a sentiment neuron can be learned by using\na single-layer multiplicative LSTM (mLSTM) [29]. The sentiment neuron can be\nfound by manually visualizing the distribution of output values of hidden units, and\na unit for which the output values can be categorized into two groups across multiple\nsentiment databases can be considered as a sentiment neuron. It has reported that\nmLSTM outperforms LSTM because it allows each possible input to have different\nrecurrent transition functions [29], so fake review generation based on mLSTM is\nbetter than that based on LSTM [9]. By replacing the output values of the sentiment\n2 https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2\nGeneration and Detection of Fake Online Reviews\nneuron with +1 (positive) or −1 (negative), we can explicitly force the output to\nbe conditioned by a speciﬁed sentiment [32]. We refer to this method as “sentiment\nmodeling”. Our implementation is based on that of Puri et al. [33]3, which had 4,096\nunits.\n4 Experiment\n4.1 Measurements and Setup\nWe measured the effectiveness of the proposed method for generating sentiment-\npreserving fake reviews in three ways. 1) The sentiment-preserving ratewas used\nfor evaluating whether the sentiment of the original review was preserved, with\nthe BERT text classiﬁer used for sentiment prediction. It was deﬁned as the ratio\nof number of sentiment correctly preserved fake reviews to number of total fake\nreviews. Note that all generated reviews (without ﬁltering) were used. 2) Subjective\nevaluation was used for evaluating the ﬂuency of the generated reviews and how\nwell people could distinguish between the real reviews and the fake ones. 3) The\ndetection ratewas used for evaluating how well machine-based detection methods\ncould identify fake reviews.\nFour types of LMs were investigated: a pre-trained GPT-2 LM, a ﬁne-tuned GPT-\n2 LM, an mLSTM LM, and a sentiment modeling. Considering the high computa-\ntional cost, we randomly selected 1,000 reviews from each test dataset for use as\nseed texts under the assumption that most of the reviews were written by a person.\nFor each LM, we then generated 20 different fake reviews based on each real review.\nIn total, there were 20,000 fake reviews per LM per dataset. The generated reviews\ncontained from 1 to 165 words, with an average of 94 words. Training of the LMs\nand review generation were performed on a machine with a Tesla P100 GPU.\nFor the subjective evaluation, we ﬁrst asked 80 volunteers (39 native and 41\nnon-native English speakers) to evaluate the ﬂuency of reviews. Fifty real reviews\n(200 −300 characters) were randomly selected (half were positive and half were\nnegative) from each test dataset, and fake reviews were generated on the basis of\nthose reviews. We used the real reviews and the fake reviews with a sentiment most\nclosely matching the associated real review for ﬂuency evaluation. The evaluation\nwas done using a 5-point Likert mean opinion score (MOS) scale, with 5 being the\nmost ﬂuent. We then asked them to select from four reviews the one they thought\nwas the most likely real review, where the four reviews contain a real review and\nthree fake reviews. The average correct selection rate was used as the metric. To\nfacilitate evaluation, the reviews were shortened to only the ﬁrst three sentences. The\nevaluations were performed on a web interface4 with the real and fake reviews listed\nin random order. The participants evaluated a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 100\nrandom reviews. Most of the participants evaluated only ten reviews. We obtained\n1025 data points for ﬂuency and real/fake selection evaluation, respectively.\n3 https://github.com/NVIDIA/sentiment-discovery\n4 An image of the interface is available at https://nii-yamagishilab.github.io/\nfakereview_interface/\nAdelani et. al.\nTable 3Rate (in %) and standard error of fake reviews preserving sentiment of original review.\nLM Amazon Yelp\nPretrained GPT-2 62 .1 ±0.9 64 .3 ±1.4\nFine-tuned GPT-2 67 .0 ±1.4 67 .7 ±1.2\nmLSTM 63 .2 ±0.7 71 .0 ±1.3\nSentiment modeling 70 .7 ±1.3 70 .1 ±1.2\nFor machine-based fake review detection, we used the ﬁne-tuned GPT-2 LM as\nthe text generation model and we used the Grover [15], the GLTR [16], and the\nOpenAI GPT-2 detector [17] as countermeasures. The Grover is based on a neural\nnetwork and it can defend against fake news generated by an NLM such as the GPT-\n2 LM. Its reported detection accuracy is 92%. The GLTR does not directly judge\nwhether text is real or fake. Rather it helps a person to distinguish real from fake text\nby reporting how likely a word in the text was machine generated. This tool assigns\none out of four labels for each word. These labels could be the top-10, top-100,\nor top-1000 most frequent words used by a machine, or the least frequently used\nwords. We concatenate numbers of each of assigned labels as a four-dimensional\nfeature vector and then input it to a regression model to tell fake and real reviews\napart. The OpenAI GPT-2 detector is based on RoBerta [34] and we call it as GPT-\n2PD. We further fused these detectors using logistic regression at the score level.\nEqual error rate (EER) was used for measuring performance of these detectors.\n4.2 Sentiment-preserving fake review analysis\nAs shown in Table 3, the ﬁne-tuned GPT-2 model was better at preserving the sen-\ntiment of the original review than the pre-trained GPT-2 model for both databases.\nThis means that a large number of fake reviews can be efﬁciently generated with a\ndesired sentiment by just ﬁne-tuning an LM. The sentiment modeling method had\nthe highest rate for the Amazon database. This was because explicitly modeling\nsentiment beneﬁts from the additional sentiment information given before the fake\nreviews are generated. This indicates that explicitly modeling sentiment could be\na more efﬁcient way to generate desired sentiment reviews. For the Yelp reviews,\nﬁne-tuned GPT-2 was also clearly better than the pretrained GPT-2 and the mLSTM\nhad the highest rate. Further analysis revealed that the mLSTM model performs very\nwell only for food and restaurant reviews but it did not generalize well to other do-\nmains or it generates reviews completely outside the context of the original review.\nAs shown in Table 4, the fake review generated by the mLSTM model review talks\nabout a restaurant experience while the original review was about a shirt purchase.\nThis suggests that we need to further explicitly preserve context. (We leave this for\nfuture work.)\n4.3 Subjective Evaluation\nAs shown in Table 5, the non-native English speakers tended to give higher scores\nfor ﬂuency than the native English speakers to the original reviews while the native\nspeakers tended to give higher scores to most cases of fake reviews (5 of 8), but the\nGeneration and Detection of Fake Online Reviews\nTable 4 Examples of fake reviews generated by four models using original review as the seed.\nBold font indicates words expressing sentiment.\nSeed / Model Yelp\nOriginal Review (SEED)\nVery badpurchase experience.

The ﬁne-tuning improved the ﬂuency compared with that of\nthe reviews generated by the pre-trained GPT-2. This suggests that an attack can be\nmade more effective by simply ﬁne-tuning existing models. For the Amazon dataset,\nthe reviews generated by explicitly modeling the sentiment (sentiment modeling)\nhad the highest overall score, followed by those generated by the ﬁne-tuned GPT-\n2 model. Interestingly, the scores for all fake review were higher than that for the\noriginal review. This observation is similar to that of Yao et al. [9], who observed\nthat people tended to consider fake reviews highly reliable. This observation does\nnot hold for the Yelp database — the score for the original reviews is higher than\nthose for the fake ones. Among the fake review generation models, the ﬁne-tuned\nGPT-2 model had the highest score (3.30).\nTable 6 shows the results for judging which of the listed four reviews was the\nmost likely real review. It was surprising to ﬁnd that it was difﬁcult to identify\nthe real review from the four options. The lowest overall correctness were 25.4%\nand 20.8% and the highest ones were 29.1% and 34.6% for the Amazon and Yelp\ndatabases, respectively. These results demonstrate that the participants tended to\nrandomly judge which of the listed four reviews was the most likely real review\nbecause the rates were close to the chance rate of 25%.\nAdelani et. al.\nTable 6 Correctness (in %) for judging which of four reviews was the most likely real review.\nBold font indicates worst case.\nModel Amazon Yelp\nNative Non-native Overall Native Non-native Overall\nPretrained GPT-2 30 .5 27 .9 29 .1 20.0 21 .8 20 .8\nFine-tuned GPT-2 28 .6 23.6 25.9 30 .0 26 .9 28 .3\nmLSTM 22.0 28.4 25.4 32.8 36 .5 34 .6\nSentiment modeling 23 .8 34 .4 29 .1 22 .4 31 .3 26 .7\nTable 7 Equal error rate in distinguishing between fake and real reviews.

We used another set consisting of 120 real reviews and\n240 fake reviews per database for training the regression models used as fusion\nfunctions. Table 7 shows detection result. For a single detector, the lowest EER of\n23.5% was achieved by the GPT-2PD. When Grover and GTLR were fused, the\nEER was greatly reduced compared to individual detectors. When Grover or GTLR\nwas combined with GPT-2D, the EER on Amazon dataset was increased while the\nEER on Yelp dataset was reduced. The lowest EER of 22.5% was achieved by fusing\nthe three detectors or fusing GTLR and GPT-2PD. The accuracy of the automatic\ndetection is higher than the chance level and it means that there are some traces\nfound for identifying the fake reviews. However, the overall EERs are very high and\nwe see that it is not straightforward to precisely detect the fake reviews generated\nby the proposed low-skilled method.\n5 Conclusion\nWe proposed a low-skilled and sentiment-preservable fake review generation method.\nIt ﬁne-tunes GPT-2 model to generate a large number of reviews based on a review\nwith the desired sentiment taken from the website to be attacked. Then it uses the\nBERT text classiﬁer to ﬁlter out the ones with undesired sentiments. Since there is\nno post-processing or word modiﬁcation, the generated reviews may be as ﬂuent as\nthe samples used for language model training. Subjective evaluation of review ﬂu-\nency by 80 participants produced a mean opinion score of 3.23 (scale of 1 −5) for\nfake reviews based on Amazon real reviews and 3.30 for fake reviews based on Yelp\nreal reviews. The values for the real reviews were 2.95 and 3.49, respectively. This\nmeans that the generated reviews had the same ﬂuency as the reviews written by\na person. Subjective judgment of which of four reviews (one real review and three\nfake reviews in random order) was the most likely real review produced correctness\nGeneration and Detection of Fake Online Reviews\nbetween 20.8% and 34.6%. This is roughly equivalent to random selection. Appli-\ncation of three countermeasures to the detection of fake reviews, Grover, GLTR,\nand GPT-2 detector, demonstrated a detection equal error rate of 22.5%. Although\nthe error rate of automatic detection methods is smaller than chance and has better\nperformance than humans, these methods are still far from perfect, meaning further\nimprovements are needed.\nWe plan to investigate ways to further preserve both sentiment and context infor-\nmation by using cold fusion [35] or simple fusion [36]. Since the generated reviews\nis the most probable sequence, they lack diversity and the corresponding distribution\narea may be already covered by the countermeasures. This would further increase\ndetection errors. We also plan to develop a countermeasure for detecting these gen-\nerated reviews.\nAcknowledgments: This research was carried out when the ﬁrst and second authors were at\nthe National Institute of Informatics (NII) of Japan in 2018 and 2019 as part of the NII Inter-\nnational Internship Program.
