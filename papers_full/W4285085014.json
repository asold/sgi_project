I Cogan1,2, Aneta J. Gubala3, Peter T. Mee1, Kim J. O’Riley1, \nBrendan C. Rodoni1,2 & Stacey E. Lynch1\nOutbreaks of avian influenza virus (AIV) from wild waterfowl into the poultry industry is of upmost \nsignificance and is an ongoing and constant threat to the industry. Accurate surveillance of AIV in \nwild waterfowl is critical in understanding viral diversity in the natural reservoir. Current surveillance \nmethods for AIV involve collection of samples and transportation to a laboratory for molecular \ndiagnostics. Processing of samples using this approach takes more than three days and may limit \ntesting locations to those with practical access to laboratories. In potential outbreak situations, \nresponse times are critical, and delays have implications in terms of the spread of the virus that leads \nto increased economic cost. This study used nanopore sequencing technology for in‑field sequencing \nand subtype characterisation of AIV strains collected from wild bird faeces and poultry. A custom \nin‑field virus screening and sequencing protocol, including a targeted offline bioinformatic pipeline, \nwas developed to accurately subtype AIV. Due to the lack of optimal diagnostic MinION packages for \nAustralian AIV strains the bioinformatic pipeline was specifically targeted to confidently subtype local \nstrains. The method presented eliminates the transportation of samples, dependence on internet \naccess and delivers critical diagnostic information in a timely manner.\nThe avian influenza virus (AIV) is highly contagious and can cause a globally significant disease of both farmed \npoultry and wild bird populations with the capacity for human transmission and subsequent pandemic poten -\ntial. The disease manifests in the respiratory tract of avian  species1 which, in severe cases can cause widescale \ndeath, particularly in poultry farms where birds are in confined spaces, allowing easy transmission of the  virus2. \nSingle incursions of the disease can therefore spread rapidly within and between poultry  farms3, resulting in \nany detections of the virus leading to strict quarantine measures, mass depopulation and decontamination of \nthe area in order to stop the  spread4. Reports from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH formally \nOIE) estimated in 2007 that the direct costs of an epornitic would be over 42 billion USD and total indirect costs \nat 1.5 trillion  USD5. In more recent years, an agricultural outbreak of AIV in 2014–2015 in the United States of \nAmerica caused an economic impact of approximately 874 million  USD6 and more recently, a concurrent out-\nbreak of three AIV strains in Victoria, Australia resulted in the culling of over 400,000 poultry birds in less than \nsix  months7. These two examples, plus modelling from the OIE, demonstrate the need for proactive detection in \nfarmed poultry and monitoring of virus in wild  waterfowl8,9.\nThe disease is caused by infection with an avian derived, influenza virus (species Influenza A virus, family \nOrthomyxoviridae genus Alphainfluenzavirus,). The AIV genome consists of single-strand negative-sense RNA \nrepresented over eight distinct gene segments, contained within an enveloped virus  particle2,10. The virus is \ncategorised by two glycoproteins involved in virus cell entry and exit, encoded by the haemagglutinin (HA) and \nneuraminidase (N) gene segments. There are 18 (HA) and 9 (N) different  subtypes2,11,12. Of the 18 HA subtypes, \ntypes H1-16 are present in wild bird populations; the virus’ natural reservoirs, with H17 and H18 exclusively \nfound in  bats11,12. Disease in farmed poultry and wild bird populations has been reported for many HA  subtypes13.\nThe H5 and H7 haemagglutinin subtypes in particular can cause significant disease in  poultry14 and have been \nlinked to major mortality events in chickens, and other farmed  poultry15,16. On occasion, zoonotic transmis -\nsion has also been reported in humans. These two subtypes of AIV cause serious damage in poultry due to the \nOPEN\n1Agriculture Victoria, AgriBio, Centre for AgriBioscience, Bundoora, VIC 3083, Australia. 2School of Applied Systems \nBiology, La Trobe University, Bundoora, VIC 3083, Australia. 3Land Division, Defence Science & Technology Group, \nFishermans Bend, VIC 3207, Australia. *email: ellen.devries@agriculture.vic.gov.au\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2022) 12:11886  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16048-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\npresence of a specific cleavage site in the HA  segment17–20. In low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV), \nthey contain a monobasic cleavage site. This site is recognised by trypsin-like proteases which are responsible \nfor the cleavage of the HA protein precursor to support virus infectivity and restricting viral infection to the \nrespiratory and intestinal  tract19, so disease is often mild to moderate in farmed  poultry13. In high pathogenicity \navian influenza viruses (HPAIV), mutations in HA gene segments cause the HA protein precursor to contain a \nmultibasic cleavage site that can be cleaved by ubiquitously expressed furin and other closely related proteases \nwhich facilitates systemic spread and entry into multiple cell types, causing higher mortality in poultry.\nWithin wild bird populations, species within the orders Anseriformes (waterfowl) and Charadriiformes \n(shorebirds) are considered the main  reservoirs9,14. Migratory birds within these orders travel through various \nflyways across the world, with the ability to spread AIV across geographically distinct regions. One example of \nthis being the East Asia Australian Flyway, stretching from far north Russia to  Australia21. Due to the distance, the \nbirds undertake the journey in stages and therefore have contact with local avian wildlife and poultry, which can \nlead to transmission of viruses, introducing potential infection to naïve local  birds22. AIV detections in Australia \nare generally considered to be genetically distinct from North American and European strains and therefore \nongoing monitoring of viruses in local populations provides a baseline for any introductions of international \nnovel influenza strains.\nMonitoring of AIVs in wild bird populations is conducted world-wide and is undertaken to understand \ngenetic diversity and ecology of circulating strains, while ensuring diagnostics are fit for purpose to support \ncommercial poultry industries as well as animal, and human  health4. Protocols for AIV surveillance programs \nwithin wild bird populations currently have inherent delays due to sample transport to laboratories and the \nmolecular testing processes used. Currently, pathotype classification (HPAIV and LPAIV) requires in vivo and \nSanger genomic sequencing information, which is both slow and expensive. Revised in-field approaches and \nimproved assays would enable faster diagnoses to be made, resulting in better disease containment for the poultry \n industries8,14,25. Whole genome sequencing provides the ability to accurately subtype and identify AIV strains, \nespecially important for H7 and H5 strains where determination of the cleavage site will inform the pathogenicity. \nCurrent pathogenicity testing relies on 1st and 2nd generation sequencing (i.e., Sanger and Illumina, respec-\ntively), which take a minimum of 24 h to generate the necessary results to deliver the diagnosis; in outbreak \nsettings this sequencing lag time could have compounding effects on the spread of the virus.\nThe rise of 3rd generation sequencing (i.e., long-read) has enabled fast, on-location, real-time sequencing of \nwhole viral genomes as a viable option for surveillance and outbreak  tracing26–30. Pioneered by Oxford Nanopore \nTechnologies (ONT), the MinION, a small hand-held portable sequencer, allows remote real-time sequencing \nof samples out of the laboratory. Direct sequencing eliminates the need to transport samples for testing, which \nreduces the time to a diagnosis and any potential for sample degradation. Rapid detection and response are of \nthe upmost importance for containing viral outbreaks and supporting control measures, as illustrated in the Zika \nvirus outbreaks in South  America28. Many studies have progressed the application of molecular screening for \nviruses outside of standard laboratories in order to utilise the benefits that come with onsite  diagnostics27,28,30–37. \nThese studies still face the associated challenges encountered with processing samples away from gold-standard \nlaboratory-based facilities. Specifically, extracting nucleic acids and sequencing without cold chain, with mini -\nmal power requirements and subsequently undertaking comprehensive bioinformatics, has proved challenging. \nAlthough in-field pathogen detection of viruses has been shown to be possible, many of the challenges were not \nfully overcome and elements of mains connected electrical power or sophisticated cloud bioinformatics were \n required31,33,35. Several studies have also utilised reference mapping-based approach for consensus  generation34,37, \nwhich is not suitable to all viruses, especially segmented viruses with high levels of variation such as AIV .\nThis study aims to develop an end-to-end in-field protocol and bioinformatic pipeline to enable the diag-\nnostician to go from sample to result (Fig. 1), including nucleic acid extraction, detection, sequencing and bio-\ninformatic analysis of AIV samples collected from Anseriformes and domestic poultry with an emphasis on the \nclassification of the HA segment in minimal time. The specific aim is not to develop a revised perfect diagnostic \nassay but to develop a HA subtyping surveillance tool that can confidently detect and subtype the HA gene in \nfield. The process was developed to perform RNA extraction and PCR detection of AIV using instrumentation \nthat can be powered from a vehicle, and to complete the sequencing and bioinformatic analysis with no internet \naccess and only a laptop computer and a local preformatted database. Additionally, this study compares Min -\nION derived and Illumina derived sequences to examine inherent error rates and validate and benchmark the \naccuracy of the newly developed assay against current standards and to assess the use of an influenza MinION \npositive sequencing control to monitor variation between MinION runs and assess variation in MinION derived \nsequence reads.\nMaterials and methods\nAIV positive and negative samples. Samples used in this study consisted of material collected from wild \nwaterfowl and commercial chicken holdings in Victoria, Australia between 2010 and 2020. Three categories of \nsamples were used in the study: historical AIV positive samples from wild waterfowl (n = 13), commercial poul-\ntry (n = 1) and wild bird field samples (n = 36) of unknow AIV status. AIV positive samples consisted of a collec-\ntion of 13 AIV historical positive samples assembled from stored − 80 °C repositories at Agriculture Victoria and \nwere used in the database. MinION sequencing was performed on a subset (n = 4) of the historical samples and \nconsisted of subtypes H13, H16, H9 and H10. AIV historical samples, subtypes H9 and H10, consisted of cloa-\ncal swab samples collected from hunter shot ducks (Lake Bolac, Western District Region, Victoria) from 2019. \nAIV historical sample, subtypes H13 and H16, were environmental faecal swabs collected from the Werribee \nWater Treatment Plant (Werribee, Melbourne, Victoria, − 37.98941, 144.62386) in 2019. In addition, a further \n36 fresh Anseriformes environmental wild bird faecal samples (of unknown AIV status) were also collected at \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2022) 12:11886  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16048-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nthe Werribee Water Treatment Plant as part of the National Avian Influenza in Wild Bird (NAIWB) surveillance \nprogram (wildlife permit 10008927, Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, State Government \nof Victoria) for testing of the in-field deployable laboratory in June 2020. A single commercial chicken sample \nconsisted of pooled faecal material collected from a commercial property during an outbreak of highly patho-\ngenic (H7 subtype) AIV in Victoria in July 2020. All collected swabs were placed in 2 mL of viral transport media \n(VTM, comprised of brain–heart infusion (BHI) broth containing 2 ×  106 U/L penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomy-\ncin, 0.5 mg/mL gentamicin and 500 U/ml amphotericin B) transferred chilled at 4 °C to the laboratory, tested \nwithin a week of collection and stored at − 80 °C prior to subtype analysis and whole genome analysis.\nAustralian AIV HA sequence database. A customised HA gene reference database was developed for \nthe in-field detection and characterisation of AIV in Australia (Table 1). Sequences were obtained from NCBI or \nGISAID (https:// www. gisaid. org/) using the following search criteria: “Influenza database, full length, Austral-\nian with the selected HA subtype chosen” (Table 1). The 13 historical AIV samples were also sequenced as part \nof this study with the sequences deposited in NCBI (OL661617, OL661619, OL661620, OL661621, OL661622, \nOL661623, OL661624, OL661625, OL675252).\nWhere no Australian AIV HA subtype sequences could be found using the above database text searches and \nwere absent from the Agriculture Victoria historical collections, southern hemisphere full length sequences from \ncountries of the East Asia Australia  Flyway14, or neighbouring countries were used. HA segment sequences for \nthe H8 and H14 subtypes were identified as absent and two sequences for each subtype were included in the \ndatabase (Table 1).\nIllumina based genomic sequencing. Whole genome Illumina based sequencing was performed on the \n13 historical swab samples to enhance the AIV Australian database and for experimental MinION comparison \n(n = 4). RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), whole genome \n amplified38,39 and Illumina sequencing libraries prepared using PerkinElmer NEXTFLEX Rapid Directional \nRNA-Seq Kit 2.0 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The finished libraries were quantified using a dsDNA HS \nFigure 1.

The sequences were assembled \nthrough  IRMA40, an iterative assembler built for influenza construction, using the default FLU parameters.\nSynthetic AIV positive control for RT‑PCR and MinION sequencing. A positive control was \nincluded to monitor the inter-assay performance of AIV whole genome amplification, the MinION DNA library \npreparation and subsequent sequencing. The positive control consisted of a synthetic double stranded DNA \n(dsDNA) fragment (Gene block, Integrated DNA Technologies, Iowa, USA) encoding the H17 HA gene segment \n(Genbank accession number CY103892.1 bp 1–1784), flanked at either end by the influenza universal whole \ngenome amplification primer sequences (MB-Tuni12 and 13 primers)41. This enabled amplification of the syn-\nthetic positive control along with the AIV samples. A mass of 40 pg of the dsDNA gene fragment was amplified \nwith 45 µL Platinum PCR High Fidelity SuperMix (1U enzyme) (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and 1 µL of 10 µM \nsolution of each MB-Tuni12 and MB-Tuni1341 primers in a total volume of 50 µL. The mix was amplified with \nthe following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min. The \namplified product was purified using an Isolate II PCR and Gel Kit (Bioline, London, UK), diluted to 1/1000 and \nquantified using the Qubit (V3) HS dsDNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The cleaned, amplified \ndsDNA positive control was diluted to form three solutions of varying copy number: (1000, 10,000 and 100,000) \nbased on calculations using the molecular weight and Avogadro’s  number42. The 1000 copy number solution \nwas then used as a positive control in all batches of samples to monitor reproducibility of the PCR and MinION \nsequencing procedures.\nIn‑field RNA extraction method and laboratory comparison. RNA from all samples in this study \nwere extracted using the in-field Biomeme M1 Bulk Sample Prep Kit (Biomeme Inc., Philadelphia, USA). Opti-\nmisation for AIV detection required major modifications to the standard protocol. Briefly, 140 µL of the samples \nin VTM was mixed with 280 µL of Biomeme lysis buffer by carefully drawing the liquid mixture up and down \napproximately 30 times in the provided syringe with a silica membrane. The liquid was incubated in the syringe \nfor two minutes and expelled (removing all liquid). The syringe was washed with one pump of 500 µL of the \nBiomeme Protein Wash followed by 750 µL of either the Biomeme Wash Buffer, or the Invitrogen PureLink Viral \nRNA/DNA wash buffer II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), which was found to be equivalent (data not \nshown). A 1000 µL aliquot of the Biomeme Drying Wash solution was drawn up and expelled and the syringe air \ndried by repeated drawing up and expulsion of air for approximately 30 pumps until no droplets were expelled. \nThe syringe was left to air dry for one minute before 150 µL of the Biomeme Elution Buffer was drawn up into \nthe syringe and left to incubate for two minutes at ambient temperature. The liquid was expelled and drawn up \nfor seven pumps before final expulsion of the eluate into a clean 1.5 mL tube. The resulting 150 µL nucleic acid \nextract was used for testing and sequencing.\nRNA was also extracted using the Invitrogen PureLink Viral RNA/DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) \nfollowing the manufacturer’s instructions. Comparative analysis between the Biomeme M1 and Invitrogen Pure-\nLink Viral RNA/DNA spin extraction kit used serial dilutions of AIV-infected cell lines which were spiked into \nnegative field collected, environmental faecal material and the relative viral load was determined by RT-qPCR.\nIn‑field AIV screening of nucleic acid extracts using RT‑qPCR. Nucleic acid extracts were tested for \nAIV by RT-qPCR which amplifies the matrix segment of the virus. Briefly, samples were processed following the \nAIV Type A generic  assay38 with 1 µL of the primer/probe mix (containing 0.9 µM of both forward and reverse \nprimers and 0.25 µM of probe from Heine et al. 38), 5 µL of extracted RNA, 12.5 µL of X2 AgPath-ID One Step \nPCR RT buffer, 1 µL of X25 AgPath-ID RT PCR enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and molecular \ngrade water to make up a 25 µL volume. The samples were then run with the following conditions: 45 °C for \n60 min; 95 °C for 10 min; and 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 45 s. For the in-field deployable laboratory, \nthe RT-qPCR assay was conducted on a Mic PCR machine (BioMolecular Systems, New South Wales, Australia) \nsupported by a 12-V battery (Itech 120AH LifePo4) linked to an Itech 2000-W Sinewave inverter and powered \nby a 100 series 4 × 4 Toyota Landcruiser. AIV positive samples were taken forward for sequencing.\nIn‑field protocol for whole genome amplification of AIV. Whole genome amplification of the AIV \npositive samples was performed as  described38,39 with only 20 cycles of routine amplification. Briefly, samples \nwere mixed with 12.5 µL Superscript III One-Step PCR reaction buffer, 0.5 µL of SuperScript III RT/Platinum \nB: Exotic sequences used in phylogenetic analysis\nSubtype Description Accession number\nH13 A/Duck/China/Weihai/2017(H13N8) MH894208\nH15 A/duck/Bangladesh/24,697/2015(H15N9) KY635719\nH16 A/Herring Gull/Delaware/597/2019(H16N3) MN911206\nTable 1.

The samples were then run with the following conditions: \n42 °C for 60 min, 94 °C for 2 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 3 min, and 20 cycles of 94 °C \nfor 30 s, 57 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 3 min and a final extension of 68 °C for 5 min.\nIn‑field protocol for library preparation. Libraries for sequencing were prepared from the whole \ngenome amplified positive samples (7.5 µL per sample) using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004, \nprotocol version RBK_9054_v2_revN_14Aug2019) with modifications. No magnetic bead clean-up was used \nafter barcode pooling and 1.3 µL of RAP was used in the 13 µL library. 1.2 µL of nuclease free water was added in \nthe final library preparation step instead of the recommended 4.5 µL as the pooled barcoded samples was 14.3µL \nApproximately 500 copies in 5.5 µl of the H17 amplified gene segment made up the dsDNA positive control. The \nnegative control was a sample from a previous surveillance trip that tested negative that was carried through the \nsame process as the positive samples. Each sample had unique DNA barcodes ligated and were then pooled to \nform a single sequencing library. The volume of each sample pooled for library preparation was adjusted accord-\ning to the Ct detected using the AIV RT- qPCR, with post-amplification values ranging from 6.5 to 16.6. Nucleic \nacid extracts with a Ct of 20 and above had 2.5 µL of the whole genome amplified material added to the final \npooled library. A sample with a Ct value in the range of 10–15 had 1.5 µL added to the library and a sample with \na Ct value of less than 10 had 1.0 µL added. Bead cleaning was not performed and the ratio of rapid sequencing \nadaptors (RAP) to pooled barcoded DNA was maintained (1.3 µL for 13 µL of pooled DNA). The final pooled \nDNA library was diluted to a total volume of 15.5 µL.\nDevelopment of a deployable, in‑field avian influenza virus detection and characterisation \nsystem. The portable system consisted of three main components- (1) wet lab reagents and consumables \n(Supplementary data 1), (2) the Mic PCR machine for AIV screening of samples and whole genome amplifica-\ntion of positive samples, (3) and the portable sequencer (MinION Mk1B device) and associated high-powered \nlaptop. A minimal number of boxes and equipment were used to transport equipment needed to set up a small \ndiagnostic-like laboratory. Everything required for the analysis in-field was packed up and transported in a sin-\ngle box (Fig. 2a–c). The Dell Precision laptop was transported in a pelican case which had specific foam indents \nfor the MinION Mk1b to be stored in. A small camping table was also bought alongside.\nMinION sequencing and real‑time, offline basecalling. The pooled barcoded MinION library was \nloaded onto the MinION Mk1b (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, United Kingdom) sequencer with \nan R9.4 flow cell. The sequencer was powered by a custom Dell Precision 7740 laptop (64 GB SD RAM, 4 TB \nSSD, Intel® Xeon 8 Core Processor, Ubuntu 18.04, NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 GPU). The library was basecalled \nin real-time using MinKNOW version 3.0.4 with offline basecalling (Guppy version 3.2.10) enabled so to be \nindependent of any internet connection requirements (provided by Oxford Nanopore upon request). Basecalled \nreads were converted from fastq to fasta file format using seqtk (version 1.3) (https:// github. com/ lh3/ seqtk) for \nsubsequent analysis.\nAIV HA subtype characterisation. Fasta files from the test samples were BLASTn analysed (version 2.6.0) \nwith the following parameters specified; outfmt 6 -max_target_seqs 1 -max_hsps 1 -evalue 0.00001, against the \ncustomised Australian AIV database as part of this study (Table  1) to identify HA subtype which in turn was \nused for consensus sequence generation.\nThree distinct bioinformatic workflows were developed and evaluated to determine the best in-field bioin-\nformatic process for AIV HA subtype characterisation. The following parameters were selected and measured as \nbioinformatic performance metrics: time and computational power required to complete the analysis; nucleotide \nsimilarity (when compared to Illumina generated genomic sequences of the same sample); and HA gene segment \ncoverage. BLASTn 2 Sequences (version 2.6.0) program was used to compare the consensus sequence output for \nall three methods. Reads that mapped to the Australian AIV database (Table  1) are referred to as the mapping \nreads and were then processed through the following methods.\nMethod 1‑ CAP3 de novo assembly. The CAP3 tool for assembly and contig construction was evaluated, which \nuses nucleotide overlaps in reads to construct  contigs43. Generated contigs were then assembled into an HA \nsegment consensus sequence. Subsequently, the top two contigs, or the singular assembled consensus sequence \n(whichever was longer), were analysed using BLASTn. A BLASTn 2 sequence analysis was manually run locally \nwith the generated consensus sequence and sequence which it mapped to from the database. The identity and \ncoverage of the contigs were recorded. The CAP3 de novo assembly pipeline did not interfere with the ongoing \nsequencing and could be initiated at any time but would only uses the data generated up to that point in time.\nMethod 2‑ Geneious de novo assembly. MinION reads mapping to the Australian avian influenza HA sequence \ndatabase were imported into Geneious (Version 2020.1.1) and processed using the de novo assembler with high \nsensitivity/medium selected as an option. “Trim sequences” and “save contigs” (max 1000) were both selected. \nThe contig with the most mapped reads was used to generate the consensus sequence by selecting the “generate \nconsensus” option with a 25% strictness setting.\nMethod 3‑ Geneious reference mapping. A second method using Geneious (Version 2020.1.1) was used to pro-\nduce a HA consensus. MinION reads mapping to the Australian avian influenza HA sequence database were \n7\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2022) 12:11886  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16048-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nimported into Geneious. The viral Influenza Database subtype with the most corresponding hits was used as the \nreference and the MinION reads were mapped to the representative subtype sequence. The resulting mapped \nconsensus was used in subsequent analysis.\nPhylogenetic analysis. The custom-made database and method outputs from this study were made into \na phylogenetic tree which included avian associated HA subtypes (H1-H16) the existing Australian database, \nwhich was enhanced with exotic strains, resulting in 55 sequences in total (Table 1A and B). The sequence data \nwas processed using MEGA11, Maximum Likelihood tree builder, 1000 bootstrapping, nucleotide substitution, \nJukes-Cantor Model with partial deletion and the average site cut-off at 51%.\nResults\nGeneration of custom database for AIV diagnostics. A collection of 13 historical AIV positive swab \nsamples were identified, whole genome sequenced on an Illumina platform and assembled using IRMA to act \nas gold standard references. All assembled viral whole genome sequences were HA segment confirmed through \nonline BLAST analysis. These sequences along with other NCBI or GISAID sequences formed the Australian \nAIV database (Table 1A), resulting in a total of 40 sequences.\nIn‑field RNA extraction method for AIV detection and sequencing. An optimised in-field RNA \nextraction protocol was developed to support the detection and sequencing of AIV from avian cloacal swabs \nand environmental faecal samples. To assess the recovery of nucleic acid the in-field RNA extraction method \n(Biomeme M1 Bulk RNA) was compared with the laboratory based nucleic extraction kit (Invitrogen PureLink \nRNA/DNA extraction kit). The optimised in-field syringe-based extraction method yielded viral RNA levels \nFigure 2.  Deployed and functional portable laboratory set up.

The positive synthetic H17 control included in all batches processed, gave a \nconsistent indication of the quality of MinION runs and therefore whether the subsequent sequence data from \nfield samples could be used. The cut off for a successful run was deemed to be > 100 mapping reads from the \nsynthetic control to the database (data not shown).\nA subset of four (H9, H10, H13, H16) samples from the historical AIV positives repository, a commercial \npoultry sample (H7) as well as the ds DNA H17 positive and the negative control were processed through the \nin-field MinION HA characterisation tool (Table 2). Generated reads were characterised using a BLASTn com-\nparison to the HA Australian Database generated in this study (Table  1). The majority of samples generated \ndatabase hits that were identified as a singular predominant HA subtype (H9 = 5202 (99.8%), H10 = 9787 (99.9%), \nH16 = 227 (86.3%), H17 = 249 (90.5%), H13 = 1533 (98.9%), H7 = 22,503 (100%)). The AIV sample (H16 subtype) \nthat was detected and sequenced had the lowest number of correctly attributed reads with the majority of the \nreads (34) that were misattributed were designated as H13 (21, (7.9%)). The negative control generated 535,589 \nreads, with a single read mapping to the AIV Australian database (H9).\nHA subtype genomic characterisation. Following the HA sequence identification, the filtered reads \nwere sub-selected into a new fasta file and assembled through the three methods presented. The pipelines dif-\nfered in both the computational requirements and time to results (Table  3). A comparison of the percentage \nsequence identity and percentage coverage of the HA segment of six selected AIV isolates generated by the \nin-field MinION sequencing method was made with the corresponding Illumina sequences (Fig.  4; Table 3). \nAll of the samples generated consensus sequences that on average had over 75% coverage for the HA gene and \nwere > 90% identical to their relevant Illumina reference sequence (Table 3).\nAcross the different subtypes, CAP3 de novo assembly Method 1 generated results within 10 min for a single \nbarcode (single sample), could run multiple barcodes in parallel and showed the highest coverage (mean 87.6%; \nrange 78–93%) across the HA segment, with a high percentage identity (mean 94.09%; range 90.48–99.11%). \nGeneious de novo assembly Method 2 and reference mapping Method 3 required a longer processing time (up \nto 4 h), and as neither method could process multiple barcodes at the same time, would take an estimated 4–6 h \nto process eight barcodes. Method 2 had the lowest coverage (mean 75.2%; range 56–87%) with a percentage \nidentity comparable to Method 1 (mean 95.95%; range 87.61–99.13%), but also had the largest variance of both \nmean percentage identity and percentage coverage. Method 3 generated the highest percentage identity (mean \n99.39%; range 97.87–99.82%), which was consistent across the subtypes as demonstrated by the low standard \ndeviation (0.77) across more than two thirds of the HA segment (mean 77.8%; range 69–86%) (Table 3).\nPhylogenetic analysis of in‑field MinION derived consensus sequence. A comparison of the \nconsensus sequences generated using the three bioinformatic methods was undertaken through phylogenetic \nanalysis that included the sequences from the Australian avian influenza sequence database, in addition to \nexotic genomic sequences (Fig. 5). The HA subtypes created their own clades with some subtypes creating closer \ngenetic relationships (H13/H16, H15/H7 and H14/H4), suggesting higher degrees of evolutionary relatedness \nthan with other subtypes. The consensus sequences generated using the three bioinformatic methods described \nin this study, placed the derived genomic sequences within their respective HA subtype branches. Phylogenetic \nanalysis identified the consensus sequences derived using Method 3, most accurately matched the related Illu-\nmina derived sequences, (Fig. 5).\nIn‑field protocol deployment. The in-field deployable sequencing capability (Fig. 2a–c) was successfully \ntested in Werribee, Victoria. RNA was extracted from 36 field samples and screened for the presence of AIV \nusing whole genome  amplification38,39. No positive samples were identified from the 36 samples screened as \nconfirmed by the laboratory-based AIV qRT- PCR (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nEarly detection of viruses is critical for managing potentially detrimental impacts of a disease outbreak, as a fast \nand effective response increases the chances of pathogen containment and  eradication44. In this study, we describe \na field deployable laboratory that can, through a series of functional wet lab and bioinformatic processes, detect \nAIV in field collected samples as well as characterise and phylogenetically analyse the AIV HA gene sequence, \nall within hours of sample collection. Although the proposed methods presented here are most likely not at the \nsensitivity level of standard matrix gene qPCR assays, it is a fast, confirmatory test which allows faster and more \nspecific actions if required.\nThe rapid development of genomic technologies in the past decade has enabled the possibility of novel, point-\nof-care genomic diagnostics to become a  reality45. The in-field sequencing capability described in this paper \nhas been achieved using a range of recently available technologies and reagents including syringe-based RNA \nextractions, a rapid library preparation kit for in-field ONT sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of datasets. \nUse of syringe-based extractions has been effective in previous viral  studies46 and was effective in this study for \nthe detection and amplification of AIV RNA in a strictly in-field setting with extraction results comparable to \nthose generated by laboratory-based RNA extraction protocols (Fig. 3).\n9\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2022) 12:11886  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16048-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nAlthough AIV has been sequenced using the  MinION34,37,47–49, a field-deployable sequencing method for HA \nsubtype classification, has not been reported. The ONT sequencing protocols using the Rapid Barcoding Kit \n(SQK-RBK004) have been successful but required lab-based spin column extraction methods, quantification of \nnucleic acid concentrations with Qubit and magnetic bead clean-up of the pooled sequence libraries that requires \nextra utilities which increases the equipment footprint of the methods. The protocol for pooling Rapid Kit bar-\ncodes recommends that the clean-up of libraries using magnetic beads is required to remove excess adapters \nand nucleic acids. However, magnetic beads require extra equipment and a sterile environment, which are both \nimpractical for field work and pooling barcodes runs the risk of overloading the MinION flowcell with excess \nnucleic acid. In order to circumvent these requirements, the Rapid protocol was modified to vary the volume of \nsample added depending on the Ct value of the AIV samples derived from the qRT-PCR38,39 (and therefore the \nconcentration of nucleic acid). This method removes the need for quantification on instruments (i.e., Qubit) but \nalso allows the user to have control over the amount of nucleic acid used.\nThe ONT Rapid Kit uses transposon-based fragmentation of DNA resulting in short and variable read lengths \nof moderate quality as the output. These inherent differences mean that the ONT reads generated from the ONT \nRapid Kit are not suitable for short read specific de novo assembly programs that are designed specifically for pair \nend reads generated from Illumina sequencers. Reads generated in this study (ranging from between 160 and \n1800 bp) were also too short for conventional MinION de novo assemblers such as  wtdbg250,  Canu51 and  Flye52. \nAlthough the reads were of similar sizes to second-generation high-throughput sequence data, MinION reads do \nnot contain Phred scores and are not paired reads, two points of data which are used in the analysis of second-\ngeneration high-throughput sequence data. Consequently, reference-based approaches have been typically used \nto generate viral consensus sequences from the Rapid  Kit27–30,34,37,53.

IRMA is a well-accepted and efficient method of genomic characterisation of virus \ngenomes from short read and high quality ONT data that has been widely  used37,48. However, the AIV database \ndeveloped for IRMA is built and trained on sequence data of American viruses and strains and given the high \nvariability between HA subtypes and clades this is not currently an appropriate approach for ONT Rapid Kit \nderived sequence data in Australia.\nTo overcome these issues and to classify HA subtypes from MinION sequencing reads, a “BLASTn-to-data-\nbase method” was used in this study. Although similar approaches have been used  before34,47 the bioinformatic \napproaches did not have the initial BLAST based analysis step and employed the Method 3 (Geneious) approach \ntested here, which is impractical for in field deployment given the computational and time (~ 4 h) investment. \nReference mapping approaches also require prior knowledge of the samples, an issue when using unknown field \nsamples. McCuen et al.49 utilised a BLAST step to identify unknown field samples before lab-based processing \nusing the Influenza Research Database curated by the U.S National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \ncontaining over 10,000 sequences, mostly originating from the Northern Hemisphere. The Influenza Research \nDatabase contained only 92 Australian sequences, covering just 11 HA subtypes (missing H16, H13, H14, H8, \nH2, H17) and only 18 of these sequences were generated post-2000 (19.5% of sequences). The data set assembled \nand used in this study (Table 1) contains 26 unique sequences post-2000 (69% of sequences in the database, the \nH5 is identical in both databases) that covered 13 subtypes as well as four subtypes that haven’t been detected \nin Australia (H2, H8, H14, H17).\nTable 3.

Some subtypes \nare more closely related than others and therefore with minimal MinION data it is possible that misattributions \ncan occur in the BLASTn screening step as seen in this study with 7.9% of reads generated from the H16 sample \nattributed to the close relative H13 (Table 2). Methods 1, 2 and 3 presented here successfully classified the HA \nsubtypes within their respective clades (Fig.  5). Method 1 CAP3 de novo assembly was preferred over Method \n2 and 3 due to the speed (30 min vs. 6 h vs. 4 h respectively). The success of this method highlights the need \nfor further processing of the BLASTn analysis as it removes any reads that have been potentially misattributed.\nThe secondary analysis step involving Methods 1, 2 and 3 presented here (Fig.  1) successfully classified \nthe HA subtypes within their respective clades (Fig.  5). Although Method 1 CAP3 generated the lowest mean \npercentage identity comparison between the MinION and Illumina sequences of 94% (Table 3) this percentage \nsequence identity was much higher than the 70% sequence divergence observed between AIV  subtypes54. It is \ntherefore unlikely that misattribution of HA subtypes will occur using this method. By adding the basic second-\nary analysis consensus step of Method 1 CAP3 to the pipeline presented here, any lack of confidence from the \nBLASTn analysis can be easily removed. When combined with phylogenetic alignment to local and international \nstrains, the fast and accurate classification of the AIV subtypes is readily achievable. The ability to perform this \nclassification in-field and in a timely fashion highlights the utility of the methods presented here. The aim of this \nstudy was not to reach perfect identity and coverage of the HA segment, but to confidently detect and subtype \nAIV in-field in the most rapid manner as this information informs incursion response decisions.\nDespite the advances reported here for the in-field detection, sequencing and subtyping of AIV strains, there \nare further improvements that would facilitate faster sample processing of field samples. Advances in datasets \nand software applications could enable specific AIV sequence assemblers to be developed and trained on country \nor region-specific genome sequence data, for the specific identification of the HA subtype. The use of neural \nnetworks in genomics is also allowing a greater processing of data in a comprehensive and timely  manner55. With \nsuitable training, a neural network would overcome the inherent variability from the HA gene. A subsequent \nanalysis would determine the origin of all AIV genome segments, including the HA gene, thus giving compre -\nhensive data from the detected AIV in regional field settings, allowing determination of the origin of the virus \nand any biosecurity implications.\nThe in-field syringe-based extraction, although comparable to laboratory-based methods, was time con-\nsuming and unable to process multiple samples simultaneously. With the rising interest in viral genomic epi-\ndemiology, high throughput extraction methods are needed, and some advances are being made in this area. \nFor example,  QuickExtract56–58 has been successfully used in the extraction of SARS-CoV-2 for bulk RT-PCR \nscreening but it has yet to be tested in a field capacity.\nEnrichment of the target nucleic acid to be sequenced could be improved to enhance the ease and efficiency \nof sequencing targeted organisms and loci. In this study PCR was used to amplify the AIV genome prior to \nsequencing. However, the time required to amplify using PCR in-field took hours not minutes, which is a signifi-\ncant advance but still not optimal. Improved polymerase enzymes would remove these limitations and methods \nusing the loop-mediated  amplification59 (LAMP) Bst enzyme should be investigated. LAMP as an enrichment \nmethod could be deployed more widely as it has been proven to be effective in-field on viruses such as  Dengue60, \n Chikungunya61,62 and  Zika63. An alternative to enzymatic enrichment is via a more targeted sequencing approach. \nAdaptive sequencing approaches being developed by ONT enable the user to dictate which nucleic acid sequences \nare processed through the ONT sequencing  platform64,65. By using raw reads, Payne et al. 65 demonstrate the \nutility of sequencing selected reads on large human datasets and enriching for specific chromosome sequences. \nSimilarly, Martin et al.64 have used adaptive sequencing effectively on mock bacterial communities which showed \nenrichment up to a fourfold increase. This method has the potential to enable enrichment of the desired sequence \nwithout the issues associated with enzymatic amplification, increasing the specificity of the sequencing platform.\nBioinformatics is an ongoing issue with in-field sequencing but hopefully as MinION in-field work increases \nand the importance of fast diagnostics becomes increasingly prevalent, more work will be dedicated to filling \nin the caveats of field research identified here and in other studies. Having a standard MinION based protocol \nfor all viruses would be valuable, however the bioinformatics needs to be carefully crafted to the question at \nhand. Protocols such as the ARTIC networks’ RAMPART prove to be useful in constructing and identifying \nSARS-CoV-2 genomes in a real-time manner but when applied to viruses such as AIV they are not nearly as \napplicable as the number of reference genomes needed are much greater than those for the coronaviruses or \nEbola to accurately encompass the diversity present. As sequencing becomes increasingly essential and routine \nin a broader number of scenarios, the data sets developed will enable a more data rich future leading to the need \nfor ever faster diagnostics and methods, that the study has tried, in part, to address.\nConclusions\nThis study developed an in-field detection and sequencing methodology for AIV and overcame all of the chal -\nlenges faced to deliver outcomes that have the same level of similarity and accuracy as compared to the gold-\nstandard Illumina IRMA constructed genome. The in-field detection and sequencing methodology applied in \nthis study to historical AIV positive samples shows a high level of similarity and accuracy when compared to \nthe gold-standard Illumina IRMA constructed genomes. However there remains significant challenges regard -\ning in-field AIV detection and sequence analysis in both procedural and bioinformatic processes to deliver fast \nreal-time, in-field sequence characterisation of AIV .\n13\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2022) 12:11886  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16048-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nReceived: 17 December 2021; Accepted: 4 July 2022\nReferences\n 1.
