Tradi-\ntional FMEA methods are often time-consuming and labor-\nintensive, requiring signiﬁcant expertise and knowledge to\nbe effective. Recent advancements in artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) and machine learning (ML) have opened new possi-\nbilities for FMEA, allowing organizations to harness the\npower of language models like ChatGPT to transform their\nFMEA process and unlock new insights [ 1].\nChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI,\nwhich uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-\nlike responses to text-based inputs. ChatGPT can under-\nstand the context of a given text, generating appropriate\nresponses, and learning from new data to continuously\nimprove its performance. The information presented has\nbeen gathered from prior FMEA investigations that were\npreviously conducted. It is derived from a compilation of\nmore than 100 trillion past data sources, representing the\namassed knowledge acquired from online records. This\ntechnology has signiﬁcant potential in FMEA, enabling\norganizations to generate and evaluate failure modes,\nidentify potential consequences, and recommend mitiga-\ntion strategies more quickly and accurately than ever\nbefore.\nGPT stands for ‘‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer.’’\nIt is a type of deep learning model that uses a transformer\narchitecture to generate human-like language. The model is\npre-trained on large amounts of text data, allowing it to\ngenerate coherent and contextually appropriate responses\nto prompts or questions [ 2]. A schematic representation of\nthe ChatGPT workﬂow is shown in Fig. 1. The transformer\nconsists of multiple layers of nodes that process informa-\ntion from both past and future inputs, allowing it to\nunderstand the context of the text it is generating.\nGPT is pre-trained on massive amounts of text data\nusing unsupervised learning techniques, allowing it to learn\npatterns and relationships in language. Once pre-trained, it\ncan be ﬁne-tuned on speciﬁc tasks such as text completion,\ntranslation, summarization, and question–answering.\nWhen generating text, GPT takes a prompt as input and\ngenerates a continuation based on the patterns and rela-\ntionships it learned during pre-training. GPT generates text\none word at a time, with each word being conditioned on\nthe previous words in the sequence. The ﬁnal output is a\ncoherent piece of text that is like human-generated\nlanguage.\nThe training data for GPT comes from large corpora of\ntext, such as books, articles, and websites. The data is\ntypically sourced from the Internet or curated by organi-\nzations like OpenAI, who trained GPT on a diverse range\nof text, including books, articles, and websites.\nIn terms of reinforcement data, GPT can be ﬁne-tuned\non speciﬁc tasks using supervised learning techniques. For\nexample, to generate text that is more relevant to a speciﬁc\ndomain, GPT can be ﬁne-tuned on a smaller dataset of text\nfrom that domain. This ﬁne-tuning process provides the\nreinforcement data that helps GPT generate more accurate\nand relevant text for a particular task.\nThe ﬁrst step was to train the ChatGPT model on the\nexisting FMEA data, allowing the model to learn from the\nmanufacturer’s previous experiences and generate more\naccurate and relevant results. The manufacturer was then\nable to use ChatGPT to quickly generate and evaluate\nD. Thomas ( &)\nInﬁnity Space, Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, UK\ne-mail: ai@pixelai.co.uk\n123\nJ Fail.

This process signiﬁcantly reduced the\ntime and cost of the FMEA process while also increasing\nthe accuracy and thoroughness of the results.\nThe power of ChatGPT in FMEA lies in its ability to\ngenerate and evaluate failure modes, identify potential\nconsequences, and recommend mitigation strategies\nquickly and accurately. Here is how it works:\n1. Training the model The ﬁrst step in using ChatGPT for\nFMEA is to train the model on existing FMEA data.\nFig. 1 The system takes input data, such as historical failure training\ndata, design information, and engineering knowledge, and uses deep\nlearning algorithms to generate and evaluate failure modes, identify\npotential consequences, and recommend mitigation strategies. The\nmodel is continuously trained and reﬁned over time, allowing for even\ngreater accuracy and effectiveness in FMEA processes\n123\n912 J Fail. Anal. and Preven. (2023) 23:911–913\nThis allows the model to learn from previous experi-\nences and generate more accurate and relevant results.\n2. Generating failure modes Once the model is trained, it\nis used to generate a list of potential failure modes for a\ngiven system or process. ChatGPT uses deep learning\nalgorithms to analyze previous data and knowledge to\ngenerate these failure modes, ensuring that the possible\nfailure modes are considered.\n3. Identifying potential consequences After generating\nfailure modes, ChatGPT can be used to identify\npotential consequences of each failure mode. Again,\nthe model uses deep learning algorithms to analyze\nprevious data and knowledge to ensure that the\npotential consequences of a failure mode are identiﬁed.\n4. Assessing risk ChatGPT can also be used to help assess\nthe risk associated with each failure mode and its\npotential consequences. By analyzing the likelihood\nand severity of each failure mode and consequence,\nChatGPT can help prioritize mitigation strategies\nbased on the greatest potential impact on safety,\nquality, and cost.\n5. Recommending mitigation strategies Finally, ChatGPT\ncan recommend mitigation strategies based on the\nidentiﬁed failure modes and potential consequences.\nThese strategies may include design changes, process\nimprovements, or other actions that can reduce the\nlikelihood or severity of the failure modes and their\nconsequences.\nThe potential of ChatGPT in FMEA is just beginning to\nbe realized, and the future looks bright. As more organi-\nzations adopt AI and ML technologies, we can expect to\nsee even greater improvements in the efﬁciency, accuracy,\nand effectiveness of FMEA processes. One of the key\nbeneﬁts of ChatGPT is its ability to continuously learn and\nimprove over time. As the model is exposed to new data\nand experiences, it can adapt and reﬁne its understanding\nof failure modes and their consequences, allowing for even\nmore accurate and insightful results. In addition, ChatGPT\nhas the potential to be used in conjunction with other AI\nand ML technologies, such as computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing, to create even more powerful and\ncomprehensive FMEA systems. By combining these tech-\nnologies, organizations can gain deeper insights into\npotential failure modes and their consequences, leading to\nmore effective mitigation strategies and greater levels of\nsafety and quality.\nOne example of the transformative potential of\nChatGPT in FMEA is in the aerospace manufacturing\nindustry. A large aerospace manufacturer was facing\nincreasing pressure to reduce the time and cost of their\nFMEA process while still maintaining high levels of\nquality and safety. The manufacturer decided to partner\nwith a technology provider to implement ChatGPT in their\nFMEA process.\nAs AI and ML technologies continue to advance, we can\nexpect to see even greater improvements in the efﬁciency\nand effectiveness of FMEA processes. ChatGPT is just the\nbeginning of what promises to be an exciting future for\nFMEA and the organizations that use it to ensure safety,\nquality, and reliability.\nReferences\n1. J. Li, M.
