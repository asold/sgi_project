    "abstract": "The Random Language Model, proposed as a simple model of human languages, is\\ndefined by the averaged model of a probabilistic context-free grammar. This\\ngrammar expresses the process of sentence generation as a tree graph with nodes\\nhaving symbols as variables. Previous studies proposed that a phase transition,\\nwhich can be considered to represent the emergence of order in language, occurs\\nin the random language model. We discuss theoretically that the analysis of the\\n\"order parameter\" introduced in previous studies can be reduced to solving the\\nmaximum eigenvector of the transition probability matrix determined by a\\ngrammar. This helps analyze the distribution of a quantity determining the\\nbehavior of the \"order parameter\" and reveals that no phase transition occurs.\\nOur results suggest the need to study a more complex model such as a\\nprobabilistic context-sensitive grammar, in order for phase transitions to\\noccur.\\n",
