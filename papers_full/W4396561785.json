    "abstract": "Abstract Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been central to the Deep Learning revolution and played a key role in initiating the new age of Artificial Intelligence. However, in recent years newer architectures such as Transformers have dominated both research and practical applications. While CNNs still play critical roles in many of the newer developments such as Generative AI, they are far from being thoroughly understood and utilised to their full potential. Here we show that CNNs can recognise patterns in images with scattered pixels and can be used to analyse complex datasets by transforming them into pseudo images with minimal processing for any high dimensional dataset, representing a more general approach to the application of CNNs to datasets such as in molecular biology, text, and speech. We introduce a pipeline called DeepMapper , which allows analysis of very high dimensional datasets without intermediate filtering and dimension reduction, thus preserving the full texture of the data, enabling detection of small variations normally deemed ‘noise’. We demonstrate that DeepMapper can identify very small perturbations in large datasets with mostly random variables, and that it is superior in speed and on par in accuracy to prior work in processing large datasets with large numbers of features.",
