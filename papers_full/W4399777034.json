  "abstract": "Causal data discovery is crucial in scientific research by uncovering causal links among a variety of observed variables. Causal dataset discovery is the task of identifying datasets that contain columns that have causal relationships with columns in a query dataset. Discovering causal links from large-scale repositories faces three major challenges: vast scale of data, inherent sparsity of causal links, and incompleteness of variables present. Identifying causal relationships among datasets is a complex and time-intensive task, especially because it requires joining datasets, to bring all variables together, before applying causal link discovery. In this paper, we introduce the Causal Dataset Discovery problem and propose a large language model (LLM)-based framework to discover potential pairwise causal links between columns from different datasets. We heuristically improve LLM's grasp of causality through prompting and fine-tuning and prevent the extreme imbalance in causal candidate distributions due to natural sparsity of causal connections. We create benchmarks specific to this task1, experimentally show that our framework achieves remarkable performance with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We summarize the distinctive behaviors of different LLM strategies, and discuss improvements for future research.",
