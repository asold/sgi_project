INTRODUCTION \nDespite of being the prerequisite for engineering courses, a preliminary research has found that \nmany students perceived calculus as a high level of difficulties among any other mathematics courses.   An \nanalysis of mathematics results over a number of seme sters in the institution under study has shown an \nalarming rate of failure in the subject. There are varieties of factors that contribute to this failure rate. Class \nabsenteeism is one of the main factor that leads to lack of thorough knowledge of the subj ect [1]. \nFurthermore, insufficient practices in working out the problem -solving exercises also contributed to this \nproblem. Based on observation, students easily distracted by surrounding activities and this may contribute to \nloss of focus and attention. As a result, the basic mathematics skills and knowledge are not absorbed entirely \nin classrooms [2]. In addition to this, students perceived mathematics as a difficult subject. The difficulties in \nacquiring the mathematic skills and concepts may deteriorate if the teaching and learning process remain \nineffective for the students. \nLearning calculus can be such a dry subject with the traditional method of teaching, which involved \ntext book, the board writing a nd exercise handouts. Records showed that the failure rate for an engineering \ncalculus in one of the public university increases from 25 to 45 percent for the past few semesters. This rate \nis high since engineering students are expected to possess strong mathematical skills and thinking. From a \npreliminary survey participated by over 800 engineering students, factors that have contributed to this figure \n  ISSN:2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 9, No. 1, January 2018 :  131–138 \n132 \ninclude poor mathematics background, prob lems in memorizing formulas, misunderstood concept and \nmathematics anxieties. \n Nevertheless, with the advancement of technology, learning mathematics can be made interesting \nand joyful. Since the revolution of computer technology, many researchers have fou nd ways to catch student \ninterest in learning calculus. Many computer software and applications have been developed to help improve \nstudent understanding in many subjects.  A bulk of mathematics applications software on learning \nmathematics is available in the market, such as Maple, MATLAB, Mathematica and others. These softwares \nare continuously upgraded in order to make them more effective and  user-friendly. These systems have \nbenefited undergraduates and postgraduates in mathematics, engineering and physi cs courses by keeping \ntrack of the details in complicated manipulations [3].  \nThere are many challenges that teachers or lecturers have to face to ensure the understanding of the \nstudents in the subject matter. Among the challenges is the difficulty in teaching different types of students in \na classroom.  In general, there are two types of stud ent in classroom and these two groups have different \nperformance outcomes [4]. The first type is the mixed -ability group who tend to attribute their mathematics \nperformance to their teacher.  The second type is the vocational -and academic-track group who are more \nlikely to blame themselves when they failed to perform well. Other challenge include the exam anxiety, \nwhich is also a causative factor that answers why students are not able to successfully  complete the  \ncourse [5]. \nNowadays, students are more attracted to study using modern technology. Students can use \nmathematics software or applications to he lp them understand the subject better . In a recent survey, it was \nreported that about 55 percent of engineering students have admitted that they encountered difficulties in \nvisualizing 3 -dimensional space function.  This problem is closely related to spatia l ability. By definition, \nspatial ability is a capacity for mentally generating, rotating, and transforming visual images . This ability is \nimportant for developing expertise in learning and work settings since it is one of the three specific cognitive \nabilities. Unfortunately, not all  students have this particular ability and this weakness has force them to \nstruggle in understanding the topic of 3-dimensional functions. They are not able to solve the given problems \nif they failed to visualize the physical s hape of the solids involved in the question. These functions include \nsphere, cone, paraboloid or other quadric surfaces.  In view to this, it is the intention of this research to \nintroduce a customized computer application to assist their learning process in visualizing the 3-dimensional \nspace functions.  \nIn this modern era, there are ways to help student to improve the understanding of mathematics by \nmeans of interactive learning technology. Mathematical software can help students in solving a problem \nwhen dealing with complex questions [6]. It may help students to improve their programming skills and \nprepare them for future, specifically when their future working environment requires them to use \nprogramming languages. In add ition, these learning tools can also help the student in a simple task, such as \nplotting 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional functions by using the computer. As an example, by only changing a \nfunction parameter, different curve or graphs can easily be plotted. When this practical part has been made \neasier for them, students will have more time to focus on the fundamental knowledge of the subject. \nFurthermore, many research have shown that the use of software or any interactive tools have definitely \nincreases the students’ interest and understanding on the subject matter [7,8].  \n  As a whole, with these mathematical interactive tools, the learning process ca n be made interesting \nand enjoyable, besides improving the students’ understanding in the subject matter. Despite these advantages, \nsome of the downsides of these learning tools are due to the cost factor and the connectivity to the cloud \nserver.  \nThe objective of this research is to develop an interactive teaching and learning tools for engineering \ncalculus sub topic. The scope of the sub topic includes, vector field, curl, divergence and basic line integral, \nunder the section of vector calculus. This tool is uploaded into a cloud website to make it easily accessible for \nany students taking the subject. \nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the Research Method, Section 3 discusses the \nResults and Analysis; and the last section presents the conclusion of the paper.    \n \n \n2. RESEARCH METHOD \n This research is divided into four phases, as depicted in Table 1. The first phase involved a \npreliminary survey to gather information on the students taking the subject. The second phase involved the \ndevelopment of the application on three different topic s. Once the application is fully developed and \nintegrated, it will be utilized in classroom teaching and learning process and student will be given a survey \nquestion to evaluate the effectiveness.  \n  \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci ISSN: 2502-4752  \nDevelopment of Learning Tools using Maples for Engineering Mathematics… (Norlenda Mohd Noor) \n133 \nTable 1. Summary of the research flow \nPhase  Activities \nPhase I : Preliminary survey \nPhase II : Development of the application on each topic of the subject \nPhase III : \na. Pre-test \nb. Test run the application \nc. Post-test \nPhase IV : Analysis  \n \n \n2.1. Phase I \n A preliminary survey was conducted in July 2016, in which 800 engineering students took part in \nanswering a set of questionnaires. These students were selected from four engineering faculties, namely civil, \nmechanical, and electrical and chemical engineeri ng. They have different background education, in which \nthey came from engineering diploma programs, matriculation studies and science diploma programs. There \nare almost 80 percent of them managed to obtain at least A grade for their mathematics subject in diploma \nprogram.       \n \n2.2. Phase II \nThe engineering calculus subject contains three main topics, sequence and series, multiple \nintegration and vector calculus. The main idea is to develop the computer application for these three topics. \nIn this paper how ever, we focused on the third chapter, that is, vector calculus. The application was \ndeveloped by using Mathlet from Maple 2016. \nAs for the beginning, the chosen sub topics for the development under vector calculus are the line \nintegral, the gradient of a function, divergence and curl. Figure 1 shows the front page of MAPLE 2016 \nsoftware. The Text and Math mode button, Combo Box, Mathematical Expression, Plot container and some \nof other menus are used to create this Mathlet tool. \n \n \n \n  \n Figure 1. Front Page of Maple 2016                            \n \n \nFirst, the tables for Mathlet are created. Then the button, text, mathematical expression box and also \nthe plot box were added using component palette. For the development of the equation, Do command is used \nto generate the solution. Others command uses the Maple command and the Edit Click Action is clicked to \ninsert the source code of the sub-topic. Then, the file is saved in any preferred folder. Figure 2a and Figure 2b \nshows the component properties f or the created button. If a button consists of certain conditions that need to \nbe satisfied, Do command is required.  \n \n \n \n   \n\n  ISSN:2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 9, No. 1, January 2018 :  131–138 \n134 \n \n \n \nFigure 2a.

Once the other two topics have been \nfully developed, it will be integrated to one single application to cater the students taking this engineering \ncalculus subject.   \n \n2.3. Phase III and Phase IV \nIn this phase, students will b e given a set of survey questions regarding the subject. They will be \nasked to share the experience in learning and understanding the subject with and without the use of the \ndeveloped tool. A surv ey will be carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the new application.  The \nanalysis from the survey will be discussed in the future research paper. \n \n \n3. RESULT AND ANALYSIS \nThe following figures depicted the interface for solving gradient, divergence , curl, line integral and \nthe graph of the vector field that are designed in this tool .  Figure 4 shows the interface for solving gradient. \nA student is required to enter a scalar function in two or three variables in the empty box on the left column.  \nThe solution will appear in the right column once they clicked the Solve for Gradient button. The purpose of \nthe second row is to evaluate the gradient at any particular point \n zyx ,, . To evaluate a different gradient, \n\nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci ISSN: 2502-4752  \nDevelopment of Learning Tools using Maples for Engineering Mathematics… (Norlenda Mohd Noor) \n135 \nstudent can click the Reset All button. Figure 5 on the other hand, shows another sample for solving gradient \nof any function of 3 variables.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Result for 2-variable Gradient \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5. Result for 3-variable Gradient \n \n \nFor solving Divergence and Curl, Combo Box is used to choose either 2 -space or 3 -space.  The 2-\nspace will display a zero value at R box and value z box. The Divergence value will display incompressible if \nthe result value is zero. If the Divergenc e display s a positive value, it is compressible and source while \nnegative value means that the vector field is compressible and sink. For Curl, it will show irrotational and \nconservative if the result appears as zero value. Else, it will be rotational. Figure 6 and  7 shows sample of \nsolving for divergence and curl in 2-space 3-space, respectively. \nThe graph in Figure 8 displays the direction that is dispersed for vector field \n  22, xyyxyxf  . \nThe range of the graph for x-plane, y-plane and z-plane are -1 to 1, respectively. \nThe last interface shown in Figure 9 enables the student to solve the line integral, in which the curve \nthat a particle moves from point a to point b is a straight line. Students are required to enter the component of \nthe vector field, the starting and ending point.  Then, solution will appear at the second row on the right box. \nAs shown in Figure 9, student will find that evaluating a line integral or work done by any vector field is very \neasy, as long as they have the basic knowledge about the line integral itself. And, it is the intention of  this \nresearch to upgrade the application to different types of curves, such as circle, parabolic and others.  \n \n\n  ISSN:2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 9, No. 1, January 2018 :  131–138 \n136 \n \n  \nFigure 6.

Students from any part of the world are abl e to \naccess the application at any time, as long as they are connected to a network. In addition, the students are \nalso able to use this facility at any time convenient to them.  \nThe application needs many more enhancement and improvements series, as it is  only an \nintroductory part of a graphical user interface (GUI) development. There are also many other sub topics can \nto be added in the application, among them are Surface integral, Divergence theorem and Stokes theorem. \nDifferent types of surfaces and cur ves will also be added to cater variety forms of vector calculus problems. \nBesides that, the content on the other two topics will be developed and these will then be integrated as a \nsingle teaching and learning tools for student as well as the lecturers.    \nIn the future project, the application will be tested by users, the student, together with the lecturers. \nIt is anticipated that this application is able to help the student in their class assignment, tutorial and thus \ndeepen their understanding of the subject content.  \n \n \n4. CONCLUSION  \nIn conclusion, the teaching and learning tool using Mathlet was successfully developed for vector \ncalculus sub topics which are gradient, divergence, curls and line integrals. The tool can be used in a \nclassroom learning pr ocess and it is expected that it is able to improve the students’ understanding on the \nsubject content.  Furthermore, this tool can also help them with their tutorials and assignments. Further study \nwill be looking at  the analysis of the students’ performa nce after the interactive tool is introduced in \nclassroom and this will be followed by the next development of learning tools covering other topics in \nengineering calculus. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThis research is funded by the Institute of Research Management &  Innovation (IRMI), Universiti \nTeknologi MARA Malaysia (UiTM) under the ARAS Grant (600-IRMI/DANA5/3/ARAS (0184/2016)).
