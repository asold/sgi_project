An inverter-\nbased ring oscillator (RO) is the most common solution for\nwireline communications due to its wide tuning range and\nsmall area. However, it exhibits poor jitter and supply noise\nrejection, especially in ad vanced CMOS [4], [5]. A recent\ntrend of injection locking a RO to a reference clock requires\nthe clocking source and its distribution to be of very high\npurity [6], which is not readily available in a highly integrated\nSoC environment. An LC tank oscillator could solve these two\ndrawbacks, but it suffers from a narrow tuning range and large\narea due to the LC-tank inductor [7], [8].\nIn state-of-the-art ROs, a high current is needed to achieve\nreasonable phase noise. In [4], the phase noise is enhanced\nby increasing the current drawn by the RO. Three identical\nROs are connected in parallel to achieve the best phase noise.\nFor less demanding applications, two out of the three cores\ncould be shut down to reduce the power consumption 3 ×\nwhile degrading the phase noise by 5 dB. The RO-based phase-\nlocked loop (PLL) typically needs a low drop-out (LDO)\nregulator to address its poor power supply rejection (PSR)\nof noise and ripple [9], [10]. The supply sensitivity is usually\nseveral MHz per mV [14]. However, an LDO with a high PSR\nover a wide bandwidth is extremely challenging in advanced\nCMOS due to the decreasing dynamic resistance r\nout and\nincreasing parasitic capacitance of (long channel) devices.\nOn the other hand, the major issue of LC-PLLs is a\nnarrow tuning range (e.g. 15–30%) and large occupied area.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Block diagram of the proposed ADPLL.\nTo increase the tuning range, multiple oscillator cores are\nusually employed [7], [11], [12]. However, the large resulting\narea is usually cost prohibitive.\nAll-digital PLLs (ADPLL) are widely used in advanced\nCMOS, where they exploit the naturally ﬁne conversion\nresolution of time-to-digital converters (TDC) and digitally\ncontrolled oscillators (DCO), thus further reducing the area\nand power dissipation over analog PLLs [4]–[6], [8], [12]–\n[18]. FinFET technology provides an especially good solution\ndue to its faster switching transistors with lower propagational\nspeed and lower power consumption, all in a much smaller\narea than in the coplanar technology [19]. In this article,\nwe present an ADPLL fabricated in 10-nm FinFET technology\nto achieve a good supply noise rejection, wide tuning range,\nand reasonable jitter performance within a very limited area\nfor clock generation and wireline communications SoCs [20].\nBlock diagram of the proposed ADPLL is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe key innovation is a compact transformer-based DCO\ndescribed in Section III. Four further innovations are intro-\nduced: 1) an adjustable magnetic coupling technique to extend\nthe DCO tuning range to near octave (Section III-B); 2) a\ncompensation of tracking bank g ain for the reduced quantiza-\ntion noise ﬂoor (Section III-D); 3) a new metastability clock\nscheme in the TDC (Section IV); and 4) a low complexity\nK\nTDC estimator to minimize the digital area (Section V).\nII. ADPLL A RCHITECTURE\nAt the heart of this ADPLL lies the differential LC-tank\nDCO, as shown in Fig. 1. To save the power consumed by\nthe clock distribution network, a D2S block transforms the\ndifferential oscillator output waveform into a single-ended\nclock, which goes to the main output as FOUT at fout ≈10–\n20 GHz. FOUT is further divided by two stages of ÷2d i v i d e r s\ngoing to the secondary output, FOUT/4, and is also fed back\nto the TDC-based phase detector through another ÷2d i v i d e r .\nIn this RF synthesizer of wide tuning range, the divider\nselection is quite important due to its trade-off between con-\nsumed power and the capability of wide operational frequency.\nAn injection-locked divider, which is widely adopted in mm-\nwave/RF wireless applications, is not in consideration here due\nto the narrow tuning range and large area. Most designers will\nuse a D-ﬂip-ﬂop (DFF) based divider, TSPC divider, or CML\ndivider in wireline applications for the wide tuning range\noperation. Current-mode logic (CML) divider could handle\nvery high input frequency due to its fast response time. Since\nthe static current is required, the power consumption is quite\nlarge. True single-phase clock (TSPC) divider is an alternative\nsolution for medium frequency due to its requirement of full\nswing. In the ﬁrst two ÷2 divider stages after the ∼10–20 GHz\nDCO, the operational frequency band is >5 GHz, so TSPC\nappears suitable. For the third- stage divider feeding the DCO\n/Sigma1/Delta1modulator, the TSPC and static dividers could both meet\nthe speciﬁcation, so the DFF /Sigma1/Delta1to save power.\nThe 2\nnd-order /Sigma1/Delta1modulator provides dithering to the\nDCO to minimize the quantization noise with a sampling\nrate of fout/8 frequency. A digital-to-time converter (DTC)\nis inserted before the TDC to dither its FREF input in order\nto reduce the reference spurs a nd improve the in-band noise\n[16]. To achieve a compact implementation of a short dither\nsequence generator, a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is\nused for DTC control.\nIII. D ESIGN OF COMPACT-TRANSFORMER DCO\nA. Transformer-Based Oscillator\nAs stated above, the RO would burn excessive power just to\nproduce a relatively mediocre level of jitter performance. Fur-\nthermore, an RO-based PLL usually requires a wide bandwidth\nand high PSR LDO to decrease its high sensitivity to noise\nand perturbations on the power supply lines coupling from the\nrest of the SoC, especially switching digital circuitry.\nLI et al.: COMPACT TRANSFORMER-BASED FRACTIONAL-N ADPLL IN 10-nm FinFET CMOS 1883\nFig. 2. (a) Conventional inductor-based oscillators. (b) Transformer-based\nLC-tank oscillators.\nFig. 3. (a) Transformer’s half-c ircuit. (b) Small-signal models.\nAs an alternative, an LC-tank oscillator could easily improve\nthe Q-factor 5–20 ×, thus resulting in a much better jitter\nperformance. For the immunity to power supply noise, the LC\ntank oscillator usually features 100 × better frequency pushing\nthan the RO-based oscillator due to its resonating frequency\nbeing established by the product of the inductor ( L)a n d\ncapacitor (C) values only. If the single-coil inductor is replaced\nwith a multi-coil inductor (i.e. transformer), a larger loop gain\ncan be achieved to bring up a more reliable start-up condition\nat a low power consumption [21].\nAs mentioned in Section I, the LC-based oscillator usually\noccupies an excessive area due to the required high-Q of\ninductor which needs to be physically large. Since the inductor\nneeds to be minimized here, its Q-factor will be inevitably\ndegraded [8]. Hence the need for a transformer with a passive\nvoltage gain which also helps with an oscillation start-up in\nlow-Q conditions, as shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 3, if we put the\nprimary coil on the drain side and the secondary coil on the\ngate side, then the voltage loop gain could be enhanced by the\nproduct of the coupling coefﬁcient k\nm and turns ratio N,a si n\n(1).\nH (s) \u0004 Gm(rout||Zin (s))km N (1)\nwhere Gm and rout are the large-signal transconductance and\noutput impedance of cross-coupled MOS, respectively. Zin is\nthe input impedance of the transformer seen from the primary\nside, as shown in (2):\nZin(s) = s3(L P LSCS)(1−k2\nm) + sL P\ns4(L P LSCP CS(1−k2m)) + s2(L P CP +LSCS)+1\n(2)\nFig. 4. 3D layout of the transformer.\nFig. 5. Magnetic coupling technique.\nComponents L P (LS)a n dCP (CS) represent the inductor and\ncapacitor in the primary (secondary) side. In this topology,\nwe set k\nm and N to 0.707 and 2, respectively. Consequently,\nthe enhancing factor voltage gain is 141%. The extra 41% in\nthe enhanced voltage gain helps the oscillation start-up in the\nlow-Q condition.\nWe minimize the inductor area by using a compact multi-\nturn stacked transformer [8]. The 3D view layout is shown\nin Fig. 4. The transformer is designed as a stacked topology in\ntwo thick metal layers utilizing i nterconnecting vias. No ultra-\nthick metal is needed. Primary inductor L p h a st w ot u r n sa st h e\nred winding at the top and pink at the bottom. It is connected\nto the drain side and the supply voltage (VDD). Secondary\ninductor Ls has four turns marked as the blue winding at the\ntop and the light blue winding at the bottom. It is connected\nto the gate side and the bias voltage (V\nB ). There are ﬂoating\ndummy metals between the bottom winding and substrate.\nThe spacing between the primary and secondary windings is\noptimized to a proper coupling coefﬁcient k\nm of 0.707 for the\nproper class-F operation [21]. The dotted lines represent vias\nto connect the upper and lower metal layers. The transformer\nhas a turns ratio of 1:2. Its size is only 42 × 42 um2.T h et w o\nmetal layers shown in Fig. 4 are the uppermost thick layers.\nTo simplify the transformer arrangement and for easy design\nreuse, the AP layer, which is widely used for high Q-factor\ninductor/transformer designs, is not adopted here. To compare\nwith the conventional LC tank oscillator, the Q-factor is ∼ 4×\nsmaller but the area is also ∼ 4× smaller because the area is\nroughly proportional to the Q-factor.\nB. Magnetic Coupling Technique for Wide Tuning Range\nHaving addressed the area compactness of LC-tank, the next\nchallenge is to extend the narrow tuning range inherent in\nthe general LC-tank oscillators. The tuning range ( f\nmax : fmin )\n1884 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS—I: REGULAR PAPERS, VOL. 68, NO. 5, MAY 2021\nFig. 6. Layout of the magnetic coupling technique.\ncould be represented as (3):\nfmax\nfmin\n=\n√\nCmax\nCmin\n(3)\nAn octave 2:1 tuning range requires the ratio of Cmax to\nCmin to be greater than 4 [25]. The switched capacitor (sw-\ncap) network is typically built with an array of metal-oxide-\nmetal (MOM) capacitors, each connected in series with a MOS\nswitch [17], [26]. Cmax results when all switches are turned\non. Likewise, Cmin is reached when all switches are turned\noff and is established by the source/drain capacitances of the\nswitch transistors and parasitics of interconnect wires [27].\nThe switch transistors must be large enough to ensure a high\nQ-factor of the sw-cap at low frequencies, but not too large\nas that would prevent C\nmin from going low enough to reach\nhigh frequencies. Hence, due to this conﬂicting requirement\non the switch size, it is hard to enlarge the Cmax /Cmin ratio\nin the sw-cap. Practically, Cmax /Cmin c o u l da tb e s tb e3i n\nadvanced technology, which results in a tuning range of 1.7.\nConsequently, we must resort to an alternative, such as\nmagnetic tuning. Figure 5 shows the concept. The secondary\ncoil of inductance L\n2, coupled to the primary coil L1 (here\nrepresenting the transformer’s equivalent winding [21]) with\na coupling coefﬁcient km, is loaded by a variable resistor R.\nThe impedance seen from the primary side is:\nZeq (s) = sL 1\ns(1 − k2\nm)L2 + R\nsL 2 + R (4)\nBy inspection, if km is 0, the equivalent inductance ( Leq =\nZeq /s) naturally falls back to L1. The same happens if R\nbecomes very large. If R is close to 0, Leq is equal to\nL1(1 − k2\nm). For all other cases, the equivalent impedance\nwill show both real (resistive) and imaginary (inductive)\ncomponents. This has been studied in [31], [32] for mm-\nwave oscillators. Our goal is to increase k\nm to minimize\nthe equivalent inductance when R → 0 such that the ratio\nLeq (R →∞ )/Leq (R → 0) = 1/(1 − k2\nm) is maximized,\nas demonstrated later in Fig. 9(a). This allows to further extent\nthe maximum resonant frequency to a much higher value.\nFigure 6 shows the layout of transformers employing the\nmagnetic coupling technique. The red and blue traces represent\nthe original 2-winding transformer, as shown earlier in the\n3D view layout in Figure 4. The green trace represents the\nmagnetic coupling coil. The switch lies on the South side\nof the green turn. Once the switch turns on, the opposite\nFig. 7. Enhancement of resonant freque ncy by magnetic coupling of different\nturns.\nFig. 8. Quality factor in adjustable magnetic coupling technique.\nmagnetic ﬁeld will try to can cel the main one according\nto the Lenz’s law, thus decreasing the equivalent inductance\nseen by the transformer and increasing its resonant frequency.\nIn N = 1, the resonant frequency will be enhanced by 15%,\nas shown in Figure 7, but it is still not high enough. We further\nneed an extra 20% enhancement to reach the octave tuning\nrange. Hence, we start to increase the number of magnetic\ncoupling turns and enhance the coupling coefﬁcient. However,\nthe resonant frequency enhancement becomes saturated after\nN = 2 due to the parasitic capacitance. More turns simply\nresult in a larger parasitic capacitance. This parasitic capac-\nitance cancels the opposite magnetic ﬁeld and degrades the\nfrequency enhancement. Hence, we have chosen N = 2t o\nobtain the largest tuning range extension of 20.6%. Although\nthe main task of the magnetic coupling winding is to produce\nan opposite magnetic ﬁeld for the cancellation, the resistance\nin this coil will be seen at the transformer’s primary via\nmagnetic coupling. The width of the magnetic coupling coil\nneeds to be traded off between the resonant frequency boost\nand Q-factor degradation. In this design, the width is set to\n1/2 of the original transformer winding to help with the inter-\nwinding spacing.\nThe strong magnetic coupling technique will inevitably\ndegrade the transformer’s Q-factor. In (5), which assumes the\nseries resistance losses are dominant, if the inductance L is\nreduced by the Lenz’s law and the effective series resistance\nr\ns is increased due to the turn-on resistance of MOS switches,\nthe Q-factor could degrade heavily.\nQ = ωL\nrs\n(5)\nLI et al.: COMPACT TRANSFORMER-BASED FRACTIONAL-N ADPLL IN 10-nm FinFET CMOS 1885\nFig. 9. (a) Effective inductance versus the loading switch resistance R.\n(b) Layout of the adjustable magnetic coupling.\nAs shown in Figure 8, as the resonant frequency goes up,\nthe Q-factor increases in the original turn-off state of extra\nmagnetic coupling. Then, at the 16 GHz switch-over point,\nQ-factor goes down when the magnetic coupling turns on.\nFully turning on the switch would induce a worse quality\nfactor than in the case of softly turning it on. The Q-factor\nwill drop 33% from 5.3 to 3.5 while fully turned on. It could\neven brake the oscillation. Hence, we need to add a softer\nmid turn-on state (engage M\nM0 in Fig. 9(b)) to provide a\nmedium inductance a nd a lighter quality factor degradation\nof only 20%. The Q-factor then increases with the frequency\nincrease from 16 to 18 GHz. This way, the quality factor will\nalways stay above the lower bound (dotted segment) and so\nthe oscillator start-up condition c ould be safe across the entire\ntuning range.\nThe relationship between R and L\neq i ss h o w ni nF i g .9 ( a ) .\nThe effective inductance gets saturated at the lower bound\nwhen the resistance is smaller than 10 /Omega1. Thus, we could\nset different switch sizes for the magnetic-coupling tuning.\nA middle turn-on state could be set by the M M0 switch\nwhich has a 25 × smaller W/L ratio than in M M1,a ss h o w n\nin Fig. 9(b). Since the 10/Omega1value requires a large MOS switch,\nthe metal routing is done in such a way that it prevents from\nhorizontal and vertical coupling of the source and drain sides\nof the MOS switch.\nC. Oscillator Design\nFigure 10 shows a complete schematic of the DCO and\nits buffers. The primary tank is drawn in blue color. It is\nconnected to the coarse and ﬁne tuning capacitors. The\nsecondary tank is in red. The turns ratio is set to 1:2 for\nthe class-F operation. PVT and BAND banks contain the\ncoarse tuning capacitors and TRACK bank contains the ﬁne\ntuning capacitors. The magnetic coupling is in green with\ntwo switchable MOS transistors.

Using a dc-coupled buffer can\nFig. 10. Schematic of transformer-based oscillator with magnetic coupling\nand DC-coupled buffer with differential- to-single-ended conversion (D2S).\nFig. 11. Time-domain waveforms at major nodes of Fig. 10 oscillator.\nprevent these issues. However, the DCO outputs at a dc level\nof VB, at which it is difﬁcult to design an effective dc buffer.\nUsing the NMOS-only buffer could solve these problems. M5–\nM 6h a v ea4× larger W/L ratio than M3–M4 do in order to\nmaintain the duty cycle and DC level of the output signal.\nM7–M14 feature the same W/L ratio for PMOS and NMOS\ntransistors and form a high-speed differential-to-signal-ended\nbuffer (D2S) to provide the single-ended full-swing clock to\nthe true single-phase clock (TSPC) divider in the following\nstage. Using a single-ended buffer helps to reduce power\nconsumption in the divider chain. An oscillation waveform\nwith a dc level of V\nDD might cause reliability issues. Since\nthe oscillation amplitude is proportional to the quality factor,\nthe oscillation amplitude in this low-Q design is not exces-\nsively large as in the conventional LC-tank oscillators. We only\nneed to ensure that the peak of oscillation amplitude would\nnot exceed V\nMAX of the process.\nFigure 11 illustrates the corresponding time-domain wave-\nforms at each stage. VD lies at the dc level of VDD (0.8 V). VD\nshape exhibits a square-like wave due to the third harmonic\ntone present in this class-F oscillator [21]. VG is a 2 × larger\n1886 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS—I: REGULAR PAPERS, VOL. 68, NO. 5, MAY 2021\nFig. 12. Point-symmetric pseduo-differ ential layout of compact transformer-\nbased oscillator.\nwaveform than VD due to the transformer’s 1:2 turns ratio.\nAfter the NMOS-only buffer, BUF DC level is down to half\nof VDD (0.4 V). Since the oscillator buffer BUF produces a\ndifferential signal which might not be rail-to-rail, D2S circuit\nhelps to transform it to a single-ended clock with a rail-to-rail\nswing for the following TSPC and CMOS clock buffers.\nThe coarse PVT bank is a binary-weighted switched-\ncapacitor array split into the transformer’s primary and sec-\nondary to achieve the maximum Q-factor enhancement [21].\nTo improve the ﬁne-tune resolution without degrading the total\ntank’s Q-factor, TRACK bank is connected to the primary coil\nto beneﬁt from the capacitance transformation of 1/ N\n2.T h e\nPVT bank provides large steps of 140 MHz/LSB and domi-\nnates the DCO tuning range [29]. The COAR and TRACK\nbanks have a resolution of 15 MHz/LSB and 1.2 MHz/LSB,\nrespectively. The COAR bank is 4 bits in binary code and the\nTRACK banks is 5 bits in thermometer code. A time-averaged\nresolution of 37.5 kHz is achieved by 5 fractional tuning bits\nundergoing a 2nd-order /Sigma1/Delta1dithering [29], feeding a 3-bit\nunit-weighted capacitor bank at the transformer’s primary.\nFigure 12 shows the DCO layout. There are two pseudo-\ndifferential transformers. The G\nm transistors M1 and M2 lie\nat the center of this layout plan. The power and ground ring\nwith the decoupling capacitors provide the AC ground for each\ntransformer. The transformers are laid out as point-symmetric\nto the center. Blue and light blue lines represent the primary\nwinding in the differential mode. Red and light red lines\nrepresent the secondary coil. They connect the gates/drains\nof MOS transistors and the power ring. This ﬂoorplan allows\nfor the magnetic ﬁeld cancellation. The transformer in the\ntop right produces a magnetic ﬁeld in one direction, but\nthe opposite direction is produced by the transformer in the\nbottom left. Once the magnetic ﬁeld is substantially canceled,\nthe ﬁeld’s interference within the SoC will also be reduced.\nThe switched-capacitor ban k could occupy the remaining\n50% of area without any area being further wasting. In the\nconventional LC tank oscillators, the differential inductors\nusually dominate the occupied area. The total DCO size is\nonly 125 × 125 μm\n2 and so the core area is only 0.016 mm 2.\nFig. 13. Nonlinear DCO gain compensa tion: (a) compensation technique;\n(b) compensation design implementation.\nFig. 14. Metastability issue in fractional-N phase-domain ADPLLs: (a) block\ndiagram; (b) timing diagram.\nD. Nonlinearity of DCO Gain\nHaving achieved the small area and wide tuning range,\nwe still see yet another drawback naturally existing in wide\ntuning-range LC DCOs—the step size non-linearity. In (6),\nthe gain Ktrack variation due to a ﬁxed capacitive step /Delta1C is\na cubic rule of resonant frequency ( f = 1\n2π\n√\nLC ) [28].\nKtrack = 2π2(L/Delta1C) f 3 (6)\nIn this design, if the frequency tuning ratio is 2 ×, the gain\nvariation will be 8 ×. Because the quantization noise is pro-\nportional to the ﬁne-tuning DCO gain, Ktrack, we need to\ncompensate the tracking steps at high frequencies to prevent\nthe ADPLL phase degradation there.\nAs a solution, we use two MOM tracking capacitors stacked\ntogether and selected for different bands. In the lower band,\ntrack0 and track1 are both used. The capacitance of track0 and\ntrack1 is roughly the same. Thus, Ktrack can select between\ntwo non-zero values of 4.1 MHz and 8.2 MHz with 2 × ratio.\nWith the original Ktrack shown in red in Fig. 13(a), there might\nbe 470% variation of the DCO gain from fmin to fmax [28].\nTo minimize the gain variation, we set a threshold frequency to\nfth for the compensation to be triggered. Since the oscillation\nfrequency is highly related to the coarse tuning bank (PVT)\n[29], the PVT control code is ﬁxed after locking. We set a PVT\ncode as a threshold to judge whether the oscillation frequency\nis higher or lower than f\nth. The circuit implementation is\nshown in Fig. 13(b). The comparator is triggered at every\nfrequency reference cycle and lets the tracking bank to use\neither track1 only or both track0 and track1. Once the PLL is\nlocked, the PVT code should be ﬁxed and the tracking bank\ncompensation completed. With this technique, the variation of\nK\ntrack will reduce from 470% to 230%.\nLI et al.: COMPACT TRANSFORMER-BASED FRACTIONAL-N ADPLL IN 10-nm FinFET CMOS 1887\nFig. 15. Solution of metastability issue in fractional-N phase-domain\nADPLL: (a) timing diagram, (b) block diagram.\nIV . METASTABILITY IN FRACTIONAL PLL S\nHaving solved the key issues of the wide-tuning-range\nDCO, the next two techniques are related to the system\nlevel. Figure 14(a) shows a block diagram of the conventional\nADPLL [13], [15]. It has two independent clock domains,\nnamely FREF and CKV , thus it could experience metastability,\nfor example, in the resampling FF for the CKV counter.\nThis is prevented by employing the red-colored D ﬂip-ﬂop\n(DFF) which aligns the clock edges of FREF to CKV , and the\nresulting retimed clock (CKR) is adopted by all the lower-\nspeed digital blocks. The ADPLL works now correctly in\nthe integer-N case since the phase error is usually a small\nconstant after locking,\n1 as shown at the top of Figure 14(b).\nIn a fractional-N ADPLL, there might be a metastability issue\nin the red DFF itself, as shown in 14(b). The DCO phase\n(i.e. edge positions) versus FREF will vary in accordance\nwith FCW and so /Delta1θ\nn constantly changes. In the fractional-\nN mode, the red DFF could likely encounter the metastable\ntiming alignment between CKV and FREF. The metastability\nissue can have a detrimental effect in increasing the fractional\nspurs.\nFigure 15 shows a new metastability resolution scheme. The\nmain idea is using the edge selector from the TDC to select the\nsafe edge of CKV (rising or falling) for the FREF sampling\nand thus to prevent the metastability risk. In “case A” of\nFigure 15(a), if the FREF rising edge is close to the CKV\nfalling edge, we use the rising edge of CKV for reclocking.\nR\nV will be selected as path A (blue dotted line) in Figure 15(b).\nIn “case B” of Figure 15(a), the CKV falling edge is chosen\nfor the reclocking. The edge selector will set RV to select\npath B in the MUX where CKV will use an extra DFF with\nthe inverted CKV clock. The edge selector judges the phase\nrelationship by the TDC data output bit Qout. We monitor the\nﬁrst transition of 0 → 1o r1 → 0 to judge the CKV–FREF\nrelationship. For example, if the ﬁrst transition is 0 → 1, i.e.\nthe region within the 1/4-th of CKV cycle, the edge selector\nwill determine it is too close to the CKV’s rising edge and\nuse case B to get the correct result.\nV. T D C G\nAIN NORMALIZATION METHOD\nTo have a compact ADPLL, a simpliﬁed digital design is\nalso important. In this section, we try to minimize the digital\ncore area of a circuit that is potentially of high complexity if\nnot properly optimized. The TDC output with a gain ( KTDC =\n1In a type-II PLL, CKV will be substantially aligned with FREF but one\ncan add a small offset to avoid the metastability in the red DFF itself.\nFig. 16. Proposed method for 1 /KTDC estimation with progressive averaging\nand time-division multiplexing.\nTV / tinv) needs to be normalized by its inverse, 1/KTDC,w h e r e\nTV and tinv are the DCO clock period and inverter delay (TDC\nresolution), respectively [13]. We present a low-complexity\nadaptive estimator of 1 /KTDC with progressive averaging and\ntime-division multiplexing, as shown in Fig. 16.\nA progressive-average (PA) calculator smoothens the TDC\noutput roughness due to the quantization noise and is preferred\nover the straightforward moving-average implementation for\ncost reasons. It could be represented as:\nKTDC,PA = /Sigma1n−1\ni=0 KTDC,i\nn (7)\nwhere, KTDC,i represents the ith sampled data that is accumu-\nlated over n samples. The sampling clock is FREF. As shown\nin Fig. 16, the circuit implementation of progressive averaging\nis quite simple. It only requires two adders and one shift\nregister. For an alternative moving average method, the system\nwould need to save n data values within a certain period, which\ncosts signiﬁcant hardware to implement. The progressive-\naverage method only saves one data value each cycle. The\narea cost beneﬁts are n − 1 times better. Generally speaking,\nthe number of n would usually be larger than 10.\nIn [22], a least-mean-squared (LMS) calibration based on\nphase error is applied to estimate the reciprocal of K\nTDC,\nbut that might suffer from a non-convergence problem in the\nfractional-N mode, especially when it is close to integer-N\n[17]. A Newton-Raphson method is proposed here to provide\na reciprocal of K\nTDC with a recursive equation and guarantee\nabsolute convergence taking max 3–4 iterations even in face\nof a large step input. The Newton-Raphson equation for\nthe reciprocal [30] is represented in (8), which recursively\ncalculates the inverse of D = KTDC over internal steps of i.\nXi+1 = Xi + Xi · (1 − D · Xi ) (8)\nAfter 3–4 iterations, Xi+1 will approach 1 /D,w h e r e0.5 ≤\nD ≤ 1. The initial value of Xi is represented as Xi=0.\nTo minimize the peak of the approximation error, Xi=0 is\nrepresented as [30]:\nXi=0 = 48\n17 − 32\n17 · D (9)\nThe above coefﬁcients of the linear approximation are deter-\nmined by Chebyshev equioscillation theorem. Using this\napproximation, the absolute error of the initial value is less\nthan 1/17. Thus, three multipliers are required to get the recip-\nrocal of 1 /K\nTDC by employing (8) and (9). Multipliers cost\na huge area and power penalty due to the digital complexity.\n1888 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS—I: REGULAR PAPERS, VOL. 68, NO. 5, MAY 2021\nFig. 17. Measurements of K TDC estimator.\nIn this design, one multiplier needs a 19-bit output (6b +\n13b). The high input word-length further makes it area/power\nexpensive. A time-division multiplexing technique is proposed\nhere to reduce the number of multipliers from 3 to 1 while\ngetting the same result. In MUX1 and MUX2, they execute the\n0, 1 and 2 MUX input paths serially with each FREF cycle.\nConsequently, the digital core size is substantially minimized.\nFig. 17 shows the measurement results of the new estimator.\nThe calculation starts as early as the PVT acquisition. The\ntrk[3:0] bus signal controls the acquisition kick-off time in\neach bank. For example, the PVT bank starts the acquisition at\n5 μs, as shown by the rising edge of the red line. The vertical\nred dotted line indicates some early settling of the 1 /K\nTDC\nsignal starting to reveal the progressive average behavior. After\n3m s , 1/KTDC is well settled and its curve is ﬂat without any\nfurther changes. The value of 1 /KTDC is 82 in this case under\nfR = 150 MHz and fV = 1.5 GHz, where fR and fV are the\nreference and variable frequencies seen by the TDC. From\nthis, the inverter delay can be calculated as t\ninv = TV /KTD C\n= 8.2 ps, in which TV = 1/fV . There are different digitally\ncontrolled settings for fast/slow settling modes of 1 /KTDC\nestimation. In Fig. 17, the slow settling mode with accurate\nadaptation results is demonstrated. For the fast settling mode,\nthe settling time could be less than 6.4 μs with ≤ 1.1% error.\nIn practice, the trade-off be tween the accuracy and speed of\nthe adaptation loop is addressed by a dynamic switch-over of\nits loop bandwidth from wide to narrow, as typically done in\nADPLLs [15].\nVI.

The overall fractional division ratio in this case is\n20.5×4 = 82, but because of the DCO’s ÷8d i v i d e r ,t h eT D C\nsees FCW = 20.5. The fractional part is 2 −1 in this case,\nwhich shows the lowest phase jitter among all the fractional\nfrequency offsets in Fig. 19(b). In Fig. 19(c), the fractional-N\nspurs are −66 dBc outside of the loop bandwidth and they\nincrease going into the inband with a 6 dB slope, as shown\nin Fig. 19(d). As the fractional-N spurs go inside the loop\nLI et al.: COMPACT TRANSFORMER-BASED FRACTIONAL-N ADPLL IN 10-nm FinFET CMOS 1889\nFig. 20.

This mode could\nreach smaller integrated jitter 669 fs without the fractional\nspurs. Figure 20(b) shows the spectrum plot. The reference\nspurs can reach −74 dBc at 12.15 GHz (150 MHz× 81), which\nis a fairly low level.\nFigure 21 shows the measured ADPLL loop settling behav-\nior of the the three DCO tuning banks by means of capturing\nthe DCO tuning input signals into the SRAM memory during\nthe actual operation. This case corresponds to the locking\nfrequency of 14.4 GHz with 150 MHz FREF. The default PVT\ncode is close to the target frequency and no acquisition is\nrequired. The start-up time is within 5 μs and the lock time is\n22 μs.\nTable II shows the performance summary and comparison\nwith state-of-the-art in PLLs featuring a small area in advanced\ntechnology. Our operational frequency is the highest among all\nLC tank oscillators. The core area is compatible with the RO\nADPLL and as little as half of the analog LC PLL [7]. The\nphase jitter could achieve sub-ps due to the transformer-based\nDCO.

C\nONCLUSION\nIn this article, we have proposed a new fractional-N ADPLL\narchitecture with the followi ng features: Nearly one octave\ntuning range with a single LC tank oscillator, which does\nnot require ultra-thick metal layers, thus could be univer-\nsally used in all CMOS ﬂavors. The DCO is assisted by\nan adjustable magnetic couplin g technique that increases the\ntuning range by 17.2%. The compensation of tracking bank\nresolution can keep the DCO gain K\ntrack roughly constant\nover this wide tuning range, thus maintaining the quantization\nlevel. A new metastability re solution scheme is adopted to\novercome the fractional-N problem. The low complexity TDC\ngain estimator, 1 /K\nTDC, reduces the digital core area by the\nprogressive average and time division multiplexing. Among all\nthe fractional-N PLLs with an area smaller than 0.1mm 2,t h i s\nwork achieves a rms jitter of 725 fs in an internal fractional-N\nmode of ADPLL’s phase detector (i.e. fV /fR). This topology\nfeaturing small area, wide tuning range, and good supply noise\nrejection shows the potential to replace ROs which necessarily\nrequire wide bandwidth LDOs, which is currently the most\ncommon solution for wireline communications.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] Y .
