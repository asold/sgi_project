  "abstract": "The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) to ultra-high-frequency (UHF) partial discharge (PD) monitoring systems in power transformers for the localization of PD sources can help create a robust and reliable system with high usability and precision. However, training the AI with experimental data or data from electromagnetic simulation is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, electromagnetic simulations often calculate more data than needed, whereas, for localization, the signal time-of-flight information is the most important. A tailored pathfinding algorithm can bypass the time-consuming and computationally expensive process of simulating or collecting data from experiments and be used to create the necessary training data for an AI-based monitoring system of partial discharges in power transformers. In this contribution, Dijkstra’s algorithm is used with additional line-of-sight propagation algorithms to determine the paths of the electromagnetic waves generated by PD sources in a three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design (CAD) model of a 300 MVA power transformer. The time-of-flight information is compared with results from experiments and electromagnetic simulations, and it is found that the algorithm maintains accuracy similar to that of the electromagnetic simulation software, with some under/overestimations in specific scenarios, while being much faster at calculations.",
