Normal operation of PWR generates corrosion and wear products in the primary circuit which are\nactivated in the core and constitute the major source of the radiationﬁeld.

It is presented in this paper, as well as its use in the engineering studies at EDF.\nTo begin with, the code structure is described, including the physical, chemical and transport phenomena\nconsidered for the simulation of the mechanisms regarding PWR contamination. Then, the use of OSCAR is\nillustrated with two examples from our engineering studies. Theﬁrst example of OSCAR engineering studies is\nlinked to the behavior of the activated corrosion products. The selected example carefully explores the impact of\nthe restart conditions following a reactor mid-cycle shutdown on circuit contamination. The second example of\nOSCAR use concernsﬁssion products and disseminatedﬁssile material behavior in the primary coolant. This\nexample is a parametric study of the correlation between the quantity of disseminated fuel and the variation of\nIodine 134 in the primary coolant.\n1 Introduction\nIn a PWR, the release, the activation and the transfer of\ncorrosion products generate radiation ﬁelds which cause\noccupational dose rates. In addition, the cases of fuel\nfailures can cause the dissemination of actinides andﬁssion\nproducts in the primary coolant. The fuel damages are the\nsources of the contamination of the PWR circuits by alpha\nemitters. To optimize reactor design and to reduce risks\nduring reactor operations, it is essential to understand the\nbehavior of corrosion products, ﬁssion products and\nactinides in PWR circuits.\nIn France, since 1970s, many R&D studies have been\ncarried out by using test loops to simulate the behavior of\ncontaminant species in PWR conditions. Furthermore,\nmany engineering studies of PWR contamination have been\nbased on the examination of data from plant measure-\nments. The test loops and the data are key to understanding\nthe contamination phenomena in PWR. Nevertheless, to\nthoroughly understand and control the mechanisms of the\nPWR contamination, it is strongly advised to develop and\nuse tools for the numerical simulations of the contamination\nof the PWR circuits.\nThe simulation of PWR contamination is an important\nchallenge for the following reasons:\n– PWR contamination is the consequence of many physical\nand chemical phenomena impacted by a large number of\ndesign and operation parameters. It is difﬁcult to clearly\nidentify the individual impact of a speciﬁc parameter by\njust analyzing the plant data;\n– the concentrations of the species generating the contami-\nnation are very low. Some species, which could represent a\nvery low concentration, could paradoxically generate\nsigniﬁcant activities. However, it is very dif ﬁcult to\nreproduce and control the behavior of species at very low\nconcentrations in the test loops;\n– PWR primary circuit presents high operating conditions\nregarding temperature, pressure, neutronﬂux and ﬂuid\nvelocity. Measuring chemical and physical data in these\nconditions is not an easy matter.\n* e-mail:moez.benfarah@edf.fr\nEPJ Nuclear Sci. Technol.2, 15 (2016)\n© M. Benfarah et al., published byEDP Sciences, 2016\nDOI: 10.1051/epjn/e2016-50038-4\nNuclear\nSciences\n& Technologies\nAvailable online at:\nhttp://www.epj-n.org\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nSince 1970s, CEA, EDF and Areva have been\ncooperating for the development of a contamination\ntransfer code [1]. The OSCAR v1.3 code is a new version\nthat incorporates the most recent advances on corrosion\nproducts, ﬁssion products and actinides modeling.\nThe code has been quali ﬁed by comparing the\nsimulation results to measured contamination data from\nEDF ﬂeet [2,3]. It is used by CEA, EDF and Areva to assess\ncontamination of operating PWRs and to optimize new\nplant design.\nThe aim of this paper is to describe the OSCAR code\nand to illustrate its use at EDF through two examples of\nEDF engineering studies:\n– the study of the impact of restart conditions on\ncontamination by activated corrosion products following\na reactor mid-cycle shutdown;\n– the study of the connection between the quantity of\ndisseminated fuel and the evolution of Iodine 134 in the\nprimary coolant in the case of fuel damage.\n2 Code description\nFor corrosion products, the source term is the result of the\ncorrosion of the base metals. The corrosion phenomenon\nleads to the formation of oxide layers and induces the\nrelease of ions in the primary coolant. The metallic\nelements taken into account are those composing the main\nalloys found in PWR primary system: Ni, Co, Fe, Cr\nand Mn.\nIn the case of fuel failure, the source term of\ndisseminated ﬁssile material is deﬁned by the dissemination\nrate speciﬁed by the user in the inputﬁle. The code takes\ninto account U, Pu, Am, Cm isotopes as alpha emitter. The\nﬁssion products taken into account are I, Xe, Kr, Cs, Rb,\nBa, La, Ru, Sr and Te isotopes.\nThe OSCAR modeling is based on the subdividing of the\nPWR circuits into elementary regions:\n– each region is deﬁned by its geometric, thermal, neutron\nand hydraulic characteristics and by its base metal. These\ncharacteristics are the main input data required for an\nOSCAR simulation;\n– each region is characterized by six media: the base metal,\nthe oxide layer, the deposit layer, particles, ions and\npuriﬁcation media. These media have different concen-\ntrations of corrosion products, ﬁssion products and\nactinides.\nThe OSCAR calculation is based on the resolution of the\nmass balance equations for each isotope in each medium of\neach region using the following equation:\n∂mi\n∂t þ _mout /C0 _minðÞ ¼\nX\nsource\nJm /C0\nX\nsink\nJm;\nwith mi the mass of the isotope (i) in a given medium [kg],t\nthe time [s], _mout /C0 _minðÞ the convection term [kg·s/C0 1] and\nJm the massﬂux between two media [kg·s/C0 1].\nThe variations of the concentrations of the species in\nthe six media result from corrosion, release, diffusion,\nconvection, activation, puri ﬁcation, radioactive decay\nmechanisms and the exchange ﬂux between the media\n(dissolution/precipitation and erosion/deposition). Fig-\nure 1describes the different media andﬂux in an elemental\nregion. The main mechanisms involved in the transfers\nbetween the six media are dissolution/precipitation and\nerosion/deposition. A detailed description of these\nmechanisms has been reported by Dacquait et al. [ 2].\nThe dissolution of a deposit occurs when the concentration\nof a soluble species in the coolant is less than its\nequilibrium concentration . Soluble species precipitate\nwhen their concentration in the coolant reaches their\nequilibrium concentration. The dissolution and the\nprecipitation ﬂux are calculated using the following\nequations:\nJ\nelt\ndissol ¼ S\n1=h þ 1=V dissol\n· Celt\nequil /C0 Celm\n/C16/C17\n;\nJelt\nprecip ¼ h:S: Celm /C0 Celt\nequil\n/C16/C17\n;\nwith S the wet surface [m2], h the mass transfer coefﬁcient\nof ions in theﬂuid [m·s/C0 1], Vdissol the dissolution surface\nreaction rate coef ﬁcient [m·s/C0 1], Celt\nequil the equilibrium\nconcentration of the element elt [kg·m/C0 3]a n dC elm the\nbulk concentration of the elementelt [kg·m/C0 3].\nIt is important to note that the dissolution and the\nprecipitation phenomena depend on the equilibrium\nconcentration. The equilibrium concentration of each\nelement and the oxide speciation are calculated by an\nOSCAR chemistry module: PHREEQCEA, a version of\nPHREEQC code [ 4], associated to a thermodynamic\ndatabase developed by CEA [5].\nFor insoluble species, the depositionﬂux, J\ndepos [kg·s/C0 1],\nis calculated by:\nJdepos ¼ 4:V depos\nDh\n·mpart;\nwith Vdepos the deposition velocity of particles [m·s/C0 1], Dh\nthe hydraulic diameter [m] andmpart the mass of particles in\nthe ﬂuid [kg].\nFig. 1. Mass ﬂux between the different media in an elemental\nregion.\n2 M. Benfarah et al.: EPJ Nuclear Sci. Technol. 2, 15 (2016)\nThe erosion ﬂux, resulting from the coolant friction\nforces, is calculated by:\nJerosion ¼ mdep /C0 elim·rdep·Sdep\nTerosion\n;\nwith mdep the mass of the deposit [kg],elim the thickness of\nthe laminar sub-layer, rdep the density of the deposit\n[kg·m/C0 3], S dep the surface of the deposit [m2] andTerosion the\nerosion characteristic time [s].\nThe source term of the corrosion products results from\nthe base metal corrosion leading to the formation of oxide\nlayers and the release of ions in the primary coolant. In the\nOSCAR code, the release of corrosion products is modeled\nby a parametric law which has been determined from the\nresults of test loops.\nIn the case of fuel damage, the dissemination rate must\nbe speciﬁed by the user in the input ﬁle. The isotopic\ndistribution of the disseminatedﬁssile material is the same\nas at the surface of the fuel pellet. The isotopic distribution\ndepends on the fuel burn-up of the damaged fuel and is\ncalculated by a speciﬁc module integrated in the code.\nThe global code structure is schematically described in\nFigure 2. The code validation was reported in previous\npapers [2,3].\n3 The use of the OSCAR code\nfor engineering studies at EDF\n3.1 First example: study of the impact of the primary\ncoolant activities at reactor restart after a mid-cycle\nshutdown\nThe radiochemical speciﬁcations applied at EDF plants\nindicate two requirements concerning the activity of the\nprimary coolant before the reactor restart: 7 GBq/t for\n58Co\nactivity and 14 GBq/t for the total gamma activity. These\nspeciﬁcations have been designed to reduce the risk of\nrecontamination by precipitation of corrosion products at\nhigh temperature. The objective of this study is to examine\nthe impact of the\n58Co coolant activity on the contamina-\ntion of the reactor circuits. The study only concerns the\nreactor restart occurring after a mid-cycle shutdown.\nThe input data used for the OSCAR simulation\ncorresponds to the reference data for a 900 MWe PWR 3\nloops reactor. Only theﬁrst 10 cycles have been simulated.\nThe reference case refers to the case of 10 cycles without mid-\ncycle shutdown. The studied cases correspond to a mid-cycle\nshutdown and a restart occurring 6 months, 3 months or\n1 month before the end of the 9th cycle. The operating data\n(power, temperatures, concentrations of boron, lithium,\noxygen and hydrogen) from the beginning of the reactor\nshutdown to the end of the reactor restart are represented in\nFigure 3. The reactor restarts after oxygenation, during the\npuriﬁcation phase, when the primary activity is decreasing\n(Fig. 4).\nFigures 5and 6 illustrate the\n58Co activities deposited\non the surfaces of the hot legs, the steam generators and the\nletdown lines during cycle 9 and 10. Theseﬁgures compare\nthe reference case to the cases with mid-cycle shutdown\noccurring 6 months and 1 month before the end of the 9th\ncycle. Theseﬁgures also describe the cases of a restart when\nthe\n58Co activity in the coolant reaches 0.7, 7 or 14 GBq/t.\nFig. 2. Structure of the OSCAR code.\nFig. 3. Operating data used for the simulation of the mid-cycle\nshutdown and restart.\nFig. 4. Evolution of the activity of58Co in the primary coolant\nduring a mid-cycle shutdown occurring 6 months before the end of\ncycle.\nM. Benfarah et al.: EPJ Nuclear Sci. Technol.2, 15 (2016) 3\nThe simulation results show that:\n– the 58Co activity in the primary coolant at reactor\nrestart has no signiﬁcant impact on the contamination of\nthe main loop (legs and steam generators). The\ncontamination of the main loop surfaces from the reactor\nrestart to the end of the cycle remains lower than the\nreference case;\n– for the letdown line, the58Co deposited activity increases\nat the reactor restart. The higher the 58Co volume\nactivity at the restart, the more signiﬁcant the contami-\nnation. After the phase of the increase which occurs when\nthe reactor restarts, the contamination of the letdown line\ndecreases during the rest of the cycle. When the shutdown\nand the restart of the reactor occur 1 month before the\nend of the cycle, the contamination of the letdown line is\nnotably higher than the reference case.\nIn conclusion, this simulation has shown that the\ncriterion concerning the\n58Co coolant activity at the reactor\nrestart after a mid-cycle shutdown has no signiﬁcant impact\non the contamination of the main loop. This criterion could\nhave an effect on the contamination of the letdown line\nespecially when the shutdown and the restart of the reactor\noccur near the end of the cycle.\n3.2 Second example: study of the connection between\nthe quantity of disseminated fuel and the evolution\nof Iodine 134 in the primary coolant\nIn the case of fuel rod damage, the release of a small amount of\nﬁssile material can cause a serious risk of contamination of\ncircuits by alpha emitters. Furthermore, actinides dissemi-\nnated in the primary system essentially have a particulate\nbehavior and they depose easily on the primary circuit\nsurfaces [6]. The detection of actinides disseminated in the\nprimary ﬂuid is very difﬁcult when the reactor is operating.\nThe solution is the indirect monitoring of theﬁssile\nmaterial dissemination using the evolution of\n134I activity.\n134I is a product of theﬁssion reactions which occur in the\nﬁssile material deposited under neutronﬂux. The OSCAR\ncode allows us to calculate the activity of134I in the primary\nﬂuid which is generated by the release of a given quantity of\nfuel. Thus, in the case of an increase in 134I activity\nFig. 5. 58Co activities deposited on the hot legs (HL), the steam\ngenerators (SG) and the letdown lines (DSCH) in the case of a\nmid-cycle shutdown 6 months before the end of cycle.\nFig. 6. 58Co activities deposited on the hot legs (HL), the steam\ngenerators (SG) and the letdown lines (DSCH) in the case of a\nmid-cycle shutdown 1 month before the end of cycle.\nFig. 7. Comparison of plant measurement and OSCAR calcula-\ntion of134I variation in a case ofﬁssile material dissemination.\n4 M. Benfarah et al.: EPJ Nuclear Sci. Technol. 2, 15 (2016)\nmeasured in the primary circuit, iterative calculations using\nthe OSCAR code (Fig. 7) lead to the determination of the\nquantity of the releasedﬁssile material.\nThanks to the OSCAR code, we also managed to draw\ncharts that may be easily used to estimate the amount of\nfuel disseminated in the PWR primary coolant in the case of\nfuel failure (Fig. 8). These charts aim at assessing the\ndisseminated quantity by using the following criteria: (i)\n134I activity at the end of the cycle and (ii) the date of the\n134I increase.\n4 Conclusions\nOSCAR is a code that incorporates the French (CEA, EDF\nand Areva) scientiﬁc and industrial work focusing on the\nPWR circuit contamination phenomena. In addition to the\nloop experiments and the plant measurement campaigns,\nthe use of a simulation tool such as OSCAR is also essential\nin predicting the contamination of the PWR circuits by\ncorrosion products,ﬁssion products and actinides. Indeed,\nthe two examples described above illustrate the usefulness\nof the OSCAR code in the study of PWR contamination for\nthe improvement of PWR operating parameters, as well as\nthe optimization of new plant design.\nReferences\n1.
