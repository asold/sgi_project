  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a hot topic in AI due to their ability to mimic human conversation. This study compares the open artificial intelligence generative pretrained transformer-4 (GPT-4) model, based on the (GPT), and Google's artificial intelligence (AI), which is based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) framework in terms of the defined capabilities and the built-in architecture. Both LLMs are prominent in AI applications. First, eight different capabilities were identified to evaluate these models, i.e. translation accuracy, text generation, factuality, creativity, intellect, deception avoidance, sentiment classification, and sarcasm detection. Next, each capability was assessed using instructions. Additionally, a categorized LLM evaluation system has been developed by means of using ten research questions per category based on this paper's main contributions from a prompt engineering perspective. It should be highlighted that GPT-4 and Google AI successfully answered 85 % and 68,7 % of the study prompts, respectively. It has been noted that GPT-4 better understands prompts than Google AI, even with verbal flaws, and tolerates grammatical errors. Moreover, the GPT-4 based approach was more precise, accurate, and succinct than Google AI, which was sometimes verbose and less realistic. While GPT-4 beats Google AI in terms of translation accuracy, text generation, factuality, intellectuality, creativity, and deception avoidance, Google AI outperforms the former when considering sarcasm detection. Both sentiment classification models did work properly. More importantly, a human panel of judges was used to assess and evaluate the model comparisons. Statistical analysis of the judges' ratings revealed more robust results based on examining the specific uses, limitations, and expectations of both GPT-4 and Google AI-based approaches. Finally, the two approaches' transformers, parameter sizes, and attention mechanisms have been examined.",
