Introduction \nThe production of ceramic pottery involves numerous steps, each of which requires \ndifferent tools. Many studies focus on pottery, sometimes as tools from a functional point of \nview, sometimes as cultural markers used to date sites, and sometimes from the point of view \nof the raw material of which they are composed. The steps involved in pottery production are \noften studied based on the remains of the pottery itself with only minor mention of the tools \nused in its production.  \n242 O.N. Crandell et al. \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2016) vol. 3, nr. 1, p. 241-258 doi:10.2218/jls.v3i1.1134 \nIn the pottery chaîne opératoire, the pre -firing technological stages are important in \nobtaining good quality ware. The processing of the raw geological materials, i.e. clays and \ntemper, necessitates specialised tools, some suitable for extraction from the pit, some for \nreducing the size of boulders resulting from excavation, and others for mixing. The final \nmodelled object can be subject of surface treatment ( e.g., smoothing, burnishing, and \npolishing) and decoration, all steps requiring special tools.  \nThis paper presents an overview of tools with potential use in the production of ceramics \nduring the Neolithic and Chalcolithic found at sites in Teleorman county (Lower Danube \nregion, southern Romania) (Figure 1). Besides the stone tools,  fragments of ceramic ware \nhave been also found (Andreescu et al. 2009a; Andreescu et al. 2009b). A local production \nwas assumed for the pottery, based mainly on the richness of sherds but n o kilns have been \nfound which were contemporary with the artefacts . Nevertheless, the wide range of stone \ntools, some highly specialized, found associated with pottery sherds arose the question if there \nis any connection between these tools and the pottery.  \n \n \nFigure 1. Location of the archaeological sites: 1. & 2. Măgura ‘Buduiasca’, 2. ‘Boldul lui Moș Ivănuș’ \ncomponent; 3. Vităneşti ‘Măgurice’. The inset map of Romania shows the location of the map.  \n \nThe shape and the surface characteristics of the lithic tools were analysed by optical non -\ndestructive studies (wit h hand loupe and stereo microscope) in order to determine their \nfunction and usage traces, respectively. These characteristics might support a possible use in \ncertain stages of the chaîne opératoire of pottery production.  \n \n2. Archaeological context  \nIn th e southern part of Romania, along the Teleorman River (Figure 1), a number of \nprehistoric sites have been extensively excavated and numerous ceramic and lithic artefacts \nhave been uncovered (Mirea 2005a; b). Surface surveys were conducted by F. Florea in 1 980, \nand by P. Mirea and Şt. Nedelcuţă -Apope in 2001. Subsequently, test excavations were \nO.N. Crandell et al. 243 \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2016) vol. 3, nr. 1, p. 241-258 doi:10.2218/jls.v3i1.1134 \ncarried out from 2001 to 2005 by R. Andreescu, D. Bailey and colleagues within the \nframework of the ‘Southern Romania Archaeological Project’ (Andreescu & Bailey 2005).  \nAmong the investigated sites are Măgura ‘Buduiasca’ (including its ‘Boldul lui Moş \nIvănuş’ component) and Vităneşti ‘Măgurice’ (Figure 1), located near to each other and \nstratigraphically covering an almost complete time span from the Early Neolithic t o the Late \nChalcolithic (Table 1) (Andreescu 2006; Andreescu  et al. 2008b; Mirea 2009) . The artefacts \nfrom this study include polishers, smoothers, mortars, grinders, and possible mattocks or \nhatchets from the Neolithic and Chalcolithic contexts. Presently  the artefacts found here are \nhoused at the Teleorman County Museum in Alexandria. \n \nTable 1. Sites from Teleorman County indicating the cultures present at each (marked with an ‘x’). Note that \nnone of the sites had Boian occupations. Ages according to (Andreescu 2006; Andreescu  et al.  2008b; Mirea \n2009). \nPeriod \nEarly \nNeolithic \nMiddle / Late  \nNeolithic \nLate Neolithic \n/ Chalcolithic \nEarly \nChalcolithic \n Culture Starčevo-Criş Dudeşti Vădastra Boian Gumelniţa \nSites Phase I II III     \nMăgura ‘Buduiasca’ (including \n‘Boldul lui Moş Ivănuş’) \nx  x x x   \nVităneşti ‘Măgurice’       x \n \nThe Neolithic field settlement at Măgura ‘Buduiasca’ is located on the lower eastern \nterrace of the Teleorman River (about 300 m northeast of the current course of the river), \nabout 1 km SE of the village of Măgura and 7 km NE of the town of Alexandria (Figures 1 \nand 2). ‘Boldul lui Moş Ivănuş’ is a protrusion of a secondary terrace, located about 500 m \nESE of the rest of Măgura ‘Buduiasca’, registered by the ‘ Southern Romania Archaeological \nProject’ as a sector of the latter. Together they may also be referred to as ‘ Buduiasca-Boldul \nlui Moş Ivănuş’ . Note that although some earlier reports and articles treat them as separate \nsites, they are currently considered to be a single site. \nThe majority of the cultural remains found at Măgura ‘Buduiasca’ belong to the Late \nNeolithic Dudeşti culture, and include pit and surface houses, stone and bone tools, ceramic \npottery, and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic sculptures. In addition to the Dudeşti  \nmaterials, ceramics attributed to the Starčevo -Criş culture (phase III) and Vădastra culture \n(phase I) were also found, as well as possibly imported ceramics from the Karanovo III -\nVeselinovo Neolithic cultures. Various flint tools have been discovered at this site, in the \nVădastra context (Andreescu & Bailey 2002; 2004; 2005; 2006; Andreescu  et al.  2003; \nAndreescu et al. 2001; Crandell 2013; Mirea 2005a; b; 2009).  \nThe settlement at ‘Boldul lui Moş Ivănuş’ is attributed to the Early Neolithic (Starčevo -\nCriş) as well as the Late Neolithic (Dudeşti and Vădastra cultures) (Table 1). There are also \nsporadic remains from later periods not covered in this study. Similar to the rest of the \nMăgura ‘Buduiasca’ site, a long sequence throughout the Neolithic has been documented here \n(Andreescu et al. 2007; Andreescu et al. 2009b; Andreescu et al. 2008a). There were many \nearly Neolithic complexes found in this component of the site. Among the very early ones \nwere several surface dwellings and pits. The artefacts were co mprised largely of household \nwaste. A few whole pots were found. The ceramics from the Late Neolithic contexts belong to \nthe early phases of the Dudeşti culture (Andreescu et al.  2007; Andreescu  et al.  2009b; \nAndreescu et al. 2008a).  \nVităneşti ‘Măgurice’ is a tell settlement located about 7 km northeast of A lexandria \n(Figures 1 and 3). The tell is 40 x 45 m wide and 6.5 m high and is in a relatively good state \nof preservation. This site has been researched from 1993 until present (Andreescu 2006; \n244 O.N. Crandell et al. \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2016) vol. 3, nr. 1, p. 241-258 doi:10.2218/jls.v3i1.1134 \nAndreescu et al. 2009a; Andreescu et al. 2008b). The discoveries at this site are important as \nall three phases of the Gumelniţa culture (A1, A2 and B1) are present in the stratigraphy. The \nentire Gumelniţa B1 level, the last occupation layer, was uncovered, continuing the research \nwith level A2. Surveys were also carried out to establish the stratigraphy of the settlemen t. \nThe features at this site include surface dwellings, hearths and pits. Many artefacts have been \ndiscovered through excavations here. The artefacts are made from clay, flint and other rocks, \nbone, antler, copper and gold (Andreescu & Borțun 1995; Andrees cu et al. 1996; Andreescu \net al. 2009a; Andreescu et al. 2008b; Mărgărit et al. 2014).  \n \n \nFigure 2. Aerial photograph showing the location of the the Măgura ‘Buduiasca’ site and the ‘Boldul lui Moş \nIvănuş’ component. (Aerial photo from the ANCPI orthophoto dataset.) \n \n3. Tool typology \nThe tools studied have here been grouped based on their possible usage in various stages \nof pottery production. We start with those which may have been used to quarry the raw clay, \nsuch as picks. We also describe tools such as  mortars and pestles involved in processing the \nraw materials – particular by coarse and fine grinding. Finally, we come to surface finishing \ntools. \n \nPicks, mattocks, or hatchets \nThe earliest stage in the production of ceramics is the extraction of clay fr om the ground. \nFor this purpose the prehistoric populations used various tools, such as picks, hammers, axes, \ndiggers (Rosenberg & Gopher 2010; Wright 1992) . Picks and hoes are used to extract of clay \nfrom the ground. They are often made of ground magmatic  rocks or knapped chert. (See \nFigure 4 for examples.) Most of these type tools found at the study sites were fragmented. \nO.N. Crandell et al. 245 \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2016) vol. 3, nr. 1, p. 241-258 doi:10.2218/jls.v3i1.1134 \nDue to the type of damage, along or originating from the leading edge, it is likely that they \nwere damaged during use (Mirea 2005b).  \n \n \nFigure 3. Aerial view of Vităneşti ‘Măgurice’ tell settlement. Photo from Andreescu (2011). (The site, outlined \nin yellow, is approximately 100 m wide.) \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Examples of possible pick axe and chisel tools from Măgura ‘Buduiasca’.  \n \nGrinding slabs and handstones  \nWright (1992), Hamon (2008b) and (Bassetti & Zamboni 1997) have outlined systems of \nclassifying grinding and polishing tools based on function and form. Simplified versions of \nthese classification systems will be used here. Wright (1992)  defines grinding slabs (also \n246 O.N. Crandell et al. \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2016) vol. 3, nr. 1, p. 241-258 doi:10.2218/jls.v3i1.1134 \nknown as grinding stones or querns) as is the lower of two grinding tools. The grinding action \ntakes place on a relatively flat plain or indented, near flat surface. As the name implies, these \ntools are involved primarily in gri nding material and much less so in pounding it (compare \nthis with the use of mortars described below.) Whereas grinding slabs are passive tools, \nhandstones (also known as grinding stones or grinders) are the accompanying active tools for \ngrinding materials on grinding slabs. They generally have a large grinding surface which may \nvary in how flat or convex it is (Wright 1992). They must be easily gripped in a person’s hand \nand be easily wielded. They will show grinding marks on one or more faces. Both grindi ng \nstones are commonly found at sites around the world and are mentioned by various authors \n(for example, Kozlowski 1989; Özkaya 2009; Rosenberg & Gopher 2010; Simmons & \nRollefson 1984; Wayessa 2011; Wright 1992; Zurro et al. 2005). \nThe artefacts looked at  this study were often made of quartzite or sandstone (see \nexamples in Figures 5 to 7). Although the primary purpose of most would likely have been for \ngrinding cereals, they were likely also used to grind various other materials, including temper \n(sand, gravel, potsherds) or even coarse fragments of pigment ores. \n \n \nFigure 5. Examples of possible grinding slabs from Măgura ‘Buduiasca’. \n \nMortars and pestles \nWright (1992) describes mortars as the lower of two tools used for pounding and vertical \nrotary grinding. By necessity these tools have a deeper and more circular indent than grinding \nslabs and may be more bowl -like in appearance. Like grinding slabs, mortars are passive \ntools. Pestles are the active tools which accompany mortars. They may be used to crus h \n(through striking or a rocking motion) or grind (through circular movement) a material in a \nmortar. These tend to be thinner (relative to their length) than grinding handstones and have a \nmore rod-like appearance. Wear will be limited to one or both of t he ends of the pestle. As \npestles are used also for pounding, they may have flake scars near the striking faces. Also due \nto pounding, the working faces may have more peck marks than a grinding handstone. There \nmay also be deeper and more circular indent t han grinding slabs and may be more bowl -like \nin appearance. The faces themselves vary from flat to slightly convex or well rounded. Flat \nfaces may have bevelled edges. Wear can often occur along the sides near the working faces \ndue to materials being groun d on the vertical inner sides of the mortar. These tools are also \ncommon at Neolithic sites from other regions such as the Near East (see for example, Mithen \net al. 2005; Nadel & Rosenberg 2010; Özkaya 2009; Rosenberg & Gopher 2010; Wayessa \n2011; Wright 1992; Wright 1994).  \n \nO.N. Crandell et al. 247 \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2016) vol. 3, nr. 1, p. 241-258 doi:10.2218/jls.v3i1.1134 \n \nFigure 6. Examples of possible grinding hand stones from Măgura ‘Buduiasca’. Grinding and crushing marks are \nvisible on the lower surface. \n \n \n \nFigure 7. Example of a handstone on a grinding slab from Măgura ‘Buduiasca’. \n \n248 O.N. Crandell et al. \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2016) vol. 3, nr. 1, p. 241-258 doi:10.2218/jls.v3i1.1134 \nAlthough grinding handstones and pestles have similar purposes and forms, their usage \nor function may be predicted based on a few characteristics. The size of the tools may indicate \nwhether the tool was being used on a large or a small amount of material. The coarseness of \nthe tools may also indicate how fine the resulting material had to be. Too ls used to grind up \nsand or other materials for temper in the clay would likely be larger but not necessarily fine \ngrained. Tools for grinding or crushing pigment might be smaller (since not as much material \nwould be needed) but would need to be smoother. Of course, the tool would have to be harder \nthan the material which it was breaking up. Pestles may be quartz, quartzite, chert or \nmagmatic rock whereas mortars are often quartzite or sandstone. \nSeveral artefacts which appear to be mortars were found at the study sites (see Figures 8). \nThey may have been used for pigment grinding by rubbing against a small slab (Andreescu et \nal. 2008b; Mirea 2005a) . Likewise, a handstone may have also been used to grind materials \nagainst a slab (Dal Sasso  et al.  2014; Hamon  2008a; Šajnerová -Dušková et al.  2009). \nChemical analysis may be able to detect traces of pigment on handstones (Domingo et al.  \n2012).  \n \nBurnishing stones and smoothers \nBurnishing and smoothing are two very common methods of improving the appearance \nand fu nctionality of ceramic vessels. Basically, smoothing helps in obtaining a more even \nsurface of the ceramic objects by removing the rough parts and filling in the pits by using wet \nhand, cloth, grass, wool, pottery sherds, and others (Spaulding 1948; Valado  2008; Wayessa \n2011; Zhushchikhovskaya & Shubina 2006) . They may be used to burnish entire surfaces or \nto produce decorative patterns before firing. They are usually produced from quartz, quartzite, \nor chert. As burnishing and smoothing tools from these si tes are the focus of another paper, \nthey will not be dealt with here in detail. Examples from Măgura ‘Buduiasca’ are show in \nFigure 9. \nViewing the artefacts at 16 x magnification (or higher) through a stereomicroscope \nhelped to indicate more about the type of usage (parallel or random scratches, crushed or \npitted surfaces, and others), the intensit y of use, and in some cases whether they were used \nagainst coarse or fine materials. Many of the polishing stones show parallel surface scratching \nconsistent with the marks found on modern polishing stones (Crandell et al. 2012; Ionescu et \nal. 2015; Ionescu et al. 2012). (See Figure 10 for examples.) \nThere were many pottery fragments which had been ground flat or slightly curved on one \nedge. It is presumed that they were used to smooth pot surfaces before firing. Figure 11 shows \nexamples from Măgura ‘Buduiasca’. Vuković (2013) also provides examples of this type of \ntool. Figure 12 illustrates how they would have been used. \n \nBlades for decorating \nBlades knapped from chert are common at almost all Neolithic and Chalcolithic (for \nexamples, see Fig ure 13). Among their varied purposes, some were likely also used to \ndecorate pottery by incisions or by pressing designs into the surface of soft clay (see for \nexample, Khalaily & Kamaisky 2002).  \n \n \nO.N.

Discussion \nThere are possi bly other uses but this paper focus on their potential involvement in the \nceramics industry. This article is intended to help other researchers to identify possible tools. \nBy knowing what to look for and what might be present within artefact assemblages, t he \nfunction and usage of artefacts may be identified. It should be kept in mind that many of these \ntools likely had other more than one function. This paper simply focused on those which \nmight have been involved in the ceramics production. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe study was financed by the PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0881 project, granted to C.I. by the \nRomanian Ministry of Education and Research.
