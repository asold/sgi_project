Next, we derive the connec-\ntions of this region active during the execution and observation\nof tool action and confront the cognitive operations implied by\nthese results with views of the cognitive processes involved in tool\nuse derived from neuropsychological studies of apraxia. Finally we\ndiscuss the emergence of tool use during evolution.\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMANS AND MONKEYS IN\nTOOL USE\nHistorically, tool use was considered a typically human behav-\nior and the emergence of tool use was considered an important\nstep in the evolution of primates, even serving to delineate the\nappearance of the genus Homo ( Ambrose, 2001). It has, how-\never, become increasingly clear that other animals, particularly\nchimpanzees and other old and new world monkeys do employ\ntools (for a review,van Schaik et al., 1999; Baber, 2003). Y et, even\nif actions using tools are simply compared between humans and\napes, it becomes apparent that humans understand the causal rela-\ntionship between the use of the tool and the results obtained,\nwhile this appears not to be the case for chimpanzees (Povinelli\net al., 2000). It seems that in other species tool use can be under-\nstood by a combination of the affordances provided by the object,\nwhich can be manipulated in a tool-like fashion, and associative\nlearning linking the presumptive tool and the result. As pointed\nout by Osiurak et al. (2010), the differences between animals and\nhumans become even clearer if one makes the comparison both\nover the lifetime of an individual, in that humans use tools fre-\nquently and spontaneously, and at the species level, because all\nhuman societies develop technological devices which evolve and\nimprove (Osiurak et al., 2010). Accordingly, it has been recently\nsuggested that the striking differences between human and pri-\nmates tool use reﬂect evolutionary discontinuities in hand-eye\ncoordination, causal reasoning, function representation, executive\ncontrol, social learning, teaching, social intelligence, and lan-\nguage (V aesen, 2012), thus suggesting important differences with\nrespect to brain structures and functions involved in tool use. The\nstarting point of this review is that the study of the neural basis\nof tool use has made sufﬁcient progress to begin to understand\nwww.frontiersin.org April 2014| Volume 5| Article 310| 1\nOrban and Caruana The neural basis of human tool use\nwhy primates such as monkeys can use tools and why the\nhuman tool use is so radically different from that of non-human\nprimates.\nMore than 15 years ago, Iriki et al. (1996) observed that the\nbody scheme could be modiﬁed by training macaques to use a\nrake to retrieve food that was otherwise out of reach. Bimodal\nneurons in the anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS; presumably\nmedial bank) having somatosensory receptive ﬁeld (sRF) and\nvisual receptive ﬁeld (vRF) representing the ﬁnger tips expanded\ntheir vRF to include the entire tool after extensive tool use. A sim-\nilar extension of the properties of the biological effector to the\ntool was observed in monkey ventral premotor cortex (vPMC)\nF5. Umiltà et al. (2008) showed that, after extensive training,\nhand grasping premotor neurons also become active during grasp-\ning with ordinary pliers and, more interestingly, with reverse\npliers requiring ﬁnger extension, rather than ﬂexion, to grasp\nthe object. Such modiﬁcations of the neural apparatus involved\nin planning and controlling object manipulation are likely to\nunderlie the capacity of macaques, and probably apes, to use\nsimple tools, such as the twigs employed in ﬁshing for termites.\nSome evidence has been obtained for similar changes in humans\nMaravita and Iriki (2004), andRushworth et al. (2003)have sug-\ngested that such changes may underlie the responses to static\ntool images reported in left aSMG. Y et, these adaptations are\nunlikely to explain the causal understanding that humans have\nof tool use, or the extent of human tool use. In contrast, the\nsporadic use of tools in animals could be simply explained by\nsuch changes in the biological grasping circuit brought about by\nmere associative learning processes. T ypically this animal behav-\nior is based on using objects such as stones or twigs, readily\navailable in the environment. This use may become conditioned\nby repeated success, including the choice of most appropriate\nobjects. Indeed, in the above mentioned experiment of Umiltà\net al. (2008), the use of complex pliers required an extensive train-\ning (6–8 months) and was actually based on associative learning,\nachieved in three subsequent, rewarded, steps: grasping the pliers,\nopening/closing the pliers and, ﬁnally, operating the pliers to grasp\nfood.\nPeeters et al. (2009)have more recently provided evidence for\na neural substrate involved in tool use that is typically human.\nThese authors compared observation of biological actions such\nas dragging or grasping, with observations of tool action having\nsimilar goals, in both humans and monkeys. They discovered that\nwhen human subjects observed tool actions a region in left aSMG\nwas differentially active with respect to static controls, while the\nsame region was not differentially active when subjects simply\nobserved the biological actions, i.e., the factors tool and action\ninteracted. This ﬁnding was very robust as it was observed in\nnearly 50 subjects, and tested with three different tool actions:\nusing a screwdriver, a rake and pliers, as well as with actions\nperformed by a robotic arm. M ost interesting, when perform-\ning the same testing in monkeys, Peeters et al. (2009) failed to\nobserve any similar interaction in the monkey inferior parietal\nlobule (IPL), even after extensive training when the animals had\nbecome proﬁcient in using the rake and the pliers. These exper-\niments indicated that the activation of left aSMG by tool action\nobservations was a typically human trait. Since the same aSMG\nregion has been reported to be activated in humans by pantomim-\ning of tool use and the execution of tool actions (see below for\nreferences), Peeters et al. (2009) proposed that human, but not\nmonkey cortex includes a region in the left supramarginal gyrus,\ndevoted to executing and observing tool actions. It should be noted\nthat these results do not exclude the possibility that in monkeys\na few scattered neurons in the biological action observation cir-\ncuit (Nelissen et al., 2011) respond to observation of tool actions.\nEven then, the results would still imply that in the human case\nthe neurons responding to tool action observation are grouped\ntogether and therefore are computationally more powerful than\nthe isolated neurons in the monkey. Indeed, the grouping of neu-\nrons with similar function is an important principle of cortical\nprocessing, as columnar and topographic organizations demon-\nstrate. The clustering of face selective neurons in the face patches\nalso illustrates the same principle (T sao and Livingstone, 2008).\nImportantly, these ﬁndings of a left aSMG activation by tool\naction observation have been replicated in a new group of 12\nsubjects (Peeters et al., 2013), conﬁrming the robustness of this\nﬁnding.\nIn conclusion these studies allow us to understand how on one\nhand monkeys and apes can become efﬁcient tool users, by mod-\nifying their biological manipulative action observation/execution\ncircuit, and why humans use tools so extensively and so proﬁ-\nciently, by possessing a uniquely human cortical region devoted to\nthe observation/execution of tool actions.\nTHE LEFT aSMG REGION DEVOTED TO TOOL USE\nIn the original experiments ofPeeters et al. (2009), the left aSMG\nregion was deﬁned as the conjunction of all the interactions for\nobserving the different tool actions and the robot hand actions.\nThis conjunction yielded 75 voxels (red outlines in Figure 1)\nlocated in the anterior tip of left SMG and centered at T alairach\ncoordinates −60, −21, 31. These voxels likely underestimate the\nregion devoted to tool action observation. Indeed, the subsequent\nstudy (Peeters et al., 2013) yielded a similar region of interaction\nfor observation of all three tool actions (rake, pliers, screwdriver)\ncombined, but located just to either side of the original 75 voxels\n(yellow outlines in Figure 1). Furthermore, testing the interac-\ntion in individual subjects yielded a moderate dispersion of the\nlocal maxima, less so in female than in male subjects. Therefore\nin Figure 1 we consider the combination of the three components\n(red and yellow outlines) showing signiﬁcant interaction in either\nexperiment (Peeters et al., 2009, 2013) as a more realistic estimate\nof the left aSMG, but these 180+ voxels most likely still remain an\nunderestimate.\nThe area is located in the anterior part of the crown of the\nSMG (Figure 1), below SI, posterior to gustatory cortex (BA 43),\nand dorsal to the parietal opercular areas (Eickhoff et al., 2006).\nThus any further extension of aSMG is likely to occur in the\ndorso-caudal direction. Area aSMG largely overlaps with cytoar-\nchitectonic area PFt (Caspers et al., 2008; Peeters et al., 2013), a\nremarkable match given all the uncertainties of deﬁning each\nof these functional and anatomical entities in different groups\nof subjects by very different means, and ensuring that they are\nproperly registered to one another.

The aSMG region exhibits a considerable anatomical\nasymmetry with a left hemisphere bias ( V an Essen et al., 2012),\nand the action observation activation is also completely asymmet-\nric, being restricted to the left hemisphere (Peeters et al., 2009).\nActivation of the aSMG region is also strongly asymmetric in\nthe planning of pantomimes of tool use ( Króliczak and Frey,\n2009) and its functional connectivity is also asymmetric (Zhang\nand Li, 2013). This left lateralization only partially reﬂects the\nleading role of the right dominant hand in tool manipulation,\nas these activations have been shown invariant for handedness\n(Króliczak and Frey, 2009; but seeLewis et al., 2006;Martin et al.,\n2011). Finally it is worth remembering that deﬁcits in tool han-\ndling are a hallmark of apraxia, w hich is generally associated\nwith left IPL lesions ( Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998). In the\nopposite hemisphere the symmetrical region is occupied by the\nhigher-order parietal motion area devoted to the extraction of\nattention-based motion, including long range apparent motion\n(Claeys et al., 2003).\nThe aSMG region was originally discovered using movies show-\ning actions performed with tools and compared with similar\nactions performed with the hand, a paradigm which at that time\nhad never been tested in fMRI. The aSMG overlaps partially with\nthe left lateralized tAIPS region (Mruczek et al., 2013)d e ﬁ n e db y\nthe subtraction viewing static tools vs. viewing static animals. A\nlong list of imaging studies clearly indicate that the aSMG area\nis also activated by the sounds produced by tools when used\n(Lewis et al., 2005), as well as by executing tool actions, imag-\ning or pantomiming tool use or making decisions about tool use\n(Binkofski et al., 1998; Chao and Martin, 2000; Moll et al., 2000;\nOkada et al., 2000; Inoue et al., 2001; Rumiati et al., 2004; Bun-\nzeck et al., 2005; Creem-Regehr and Lee, 2005;Johnson-Frey et al.,\n2005; V alyear et al., 2007;Jacobs et al., 2009; Króliczak and Frey,\n2009; Gallivan et al., 2013). The activation during both observa-\ntion and execution of tool actions suggests that the aSMG may\nhouse mirror neurons (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004) for tool\nactions. Finally, the rostral part of SMG is activated when indi-\nviduals make prehistoric tools or observe their production (Stout\nand Chaminade, 2007; Stout et al., 2008, 2011). Most of these\nimaging studies report the activation of several parietal activa-\ntion sites, in addition to the aSMG. With respect to activation by\ntool action observation, Peeters et al. (2013) were able to show\nthe uniqueness of aSMG ( Figure 2). This region was the only\nparietal region of interest (ROI) out of 11 exhibiting a signiﬁcant\ninteraction between the factors action and tool. Indeed the activ-\nity proﬁle indicates that, as in the original Peeters et al. (2009)\nstudy, the differential activation for observing tool actions signiﬁ-\ncantly exceeded the differential activation for observing biological\nactions.\nPeeters et al. (2013)showed that the left aSMG was activated\nas much by the observation of rake actions as by the observa-\ntion of a human hand dragging an object like a rake. Although\nthe activation of the aSMG by rake action observation was rel-\natively weak, the same observation was made with two different\ngroups of subjects. This ﬁnding suggests that what is critical is\nthe observation of tool actions are the kinematics of the action,\nwhich are very different for tools and biological effectors. It fur-\nther suggests an important distinction between the activation of\nthe putative human homolog of anterior intraparietal (phAIP) and\naSMG during observation of tool actions. Area phAIP is activated\nby observing the tool being grasped (Jacobs et al., 2009), just as\nfor\nany other object, explaining why phAIP is also activated when\nobserving biological manipulative actions. On the other hand,\naSMG is activated by observing the tool being moved to achieve\nthe goal (picking up or dragging the object toward the actor). One\nmay therefore extrapolate and suggest that during execution phAIP\nand aSMG play similar roles, with phAIP planning the grasp of the\ntool and aSMG planning the movement of the tool to obtain the\ngoal.\nIn conclusion functional imaging provides compelling evidence\nthat the aSMG region, localized in the anterior tip of left IPL\nis specialized for processing of diverse aspects of tool use, using\nkinematics as the main visual feature of tool action.\nNEURAL NETWORKS FOR TOOL ACTION EXECUTION AND\nOBSERVATION\nIn this section we propose schemes for the afferent and effer-\nent connections of phAIP (bilaterally, but with left dominance\nif right-handed subject) and left aSMG, operating in parallel dur-\ning action execution and observation. These schemes will combine\nknowledge of connections of monkey cortical regions for which\nhomology is known or plausible, as well as some human connec-\ntivity data, which by nature are indirect and must be considered\nwith circumspection.\nHAND AND TOOL ACTION EXECUTION\nThe connections of phAIP and aSMG operating when agents plan\nfor the use of a tool are shown in Figure 3. Left phAIP and left\naSMG act in parallel, possibly exchanging lateral connections, and\nsend converging signals to vPMC. The parallel nature of this oper-\nation needs qualiﬁcation as only phAIP is active in planning hand\nactions, while both phAIP and aSMG operate during planning of\ntool actions. Convergence upon vPMC is supported by the evi-\ndence that, in the monkey, the same F5 neurons are active during\nthe last phase of the grasping, i.e., the closure of the effector,\nregardless of whether the action is performed with the hand, with\na tool, or even with a tool requiring an opposite biomechanical\nmovement (ﬁnger opening rather than closing) to grasp the object\n(Umiltà et al., 2008). It is noteworthy that the parallel operation\nof phAIP and aSMG is a further elaboration of the ventro-dorsal\nstream (Rizzolatti and Matelli, 2003) of the dorsal visual path-\nway, or its human homolog. This does not imply that planning\ntool and hand actions are the only function of the ventro-dorsal\nstream, or that the present scheme is the only possible elaboration\nof this stream. Our view is related to those ofDaprati and Sirigu\n(2006) and Binkofski and Buxbaum (2013), who both consider a\nrole for the ventro-dorsal stream in tool use, but also stress the\nrole of the dorso-dorsal stream in planning hand actions toward\nobjects.\nThe monkey AIP is involved in planning grasping and other\nmanipulative action using visual signals indicating the shape and\nsize of objects; more speciﬁcally, this region has a visual compo-\nnent, located in the posterior sector and housing neurons selective\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition April 2014| Volume 5| Article 310| 4\nOrban and Caruana The neural basis of human tool use\nFIGURE 2| Speciﬁcity of left aSMG amongst parietal regions for tool\naction observation (fromPeeters et al., 2013).Activity proﬁles of the 1 1\nROIs with locations of these ROIs shown in the middle panel. 10 ROIs were\ndeﬁned in left parietal cortex: aSMG, phAIP and DIPSA, DIPSM (Peeters et al.,\n2009), three tool related ROIs fromJohnson-Frey et al.(2005; JF1-3), two\nfrom Valyear et al.(2007; Va1-2) and one fromMahon et al.(2007; Ma).

The\nblack asterisks indicate the only ROI in which the interaction between tool\nand action was signiﬁcant (p\n< 0.05 corrected for 1 1 comparisons): aSMG.\nfor 3D shape from stereo (Srivastava et al., 2009), and a motor\ncomponent, located in the anterior sector and housing visuomo-\ntor and motor neurons (Murata et al., 1996, 2000). Like monkey\nAIP , its human homolog comprises an anterior sector with motor\nand visuomotor properties, phAIP , and a posterior visual sec-\ntor, the dorsal IPS anterior (DIPSA) region, probably equivalent\nto IPS5 (Mruczek et al., 2013), which, most likely, play similar\nroles in grasping various objects, including tools. In the monkey,\nAIP receives from caudal IPS (CIP), that itself receives from V3A\n(Nakamura et al., 2001). In humans, V7 and its twin area V7A\n(Georgieva et al., 2009; Kolster et al., 2011), likely equivalent to\nIPS0-1 (Silver et al., 2005), may correspond in the monkey to the\nCIP1-2 pair (Arcaro et al., 2011;Janssens et al., 2013). V7 overlaps\nheavily with a motion-sensitive area ventral intraparietal sulcus\n(VIPS; Sunaert et al., 1999) which is incorporated in the present\nscheme. In humans, the region corresponding to the monkey’s\nV3A may have expanded and may include the four areas described\nin the V3A complex byGeorgieva et al. (2009). Hence we indicate\nin Figure 3 input to DIPSA from the V3A complex via VIPS. In\nthe monkey AIP also receives input from the lower bank of supe-\nrior temporal sulcus (STS; Borra et al., 2008) which supposedly\nprovides input concerning object properties. In deference to the\nhomology between the monkey IT and the human lateral occipital\ncomplex (LOC;Denys et al., 2004), we show an input from a subre-\ngion of LOC (LOC\no), on the ventral occipito-temporal surface, to\nphAIP . LOC receives from the V4 complex in the ventral pathway.\nwww.frontiersin.org April 2014| Volume 5| Article 310| 5\nOrban and Caruana The neural basis of human tool use\nFIGURE 3| Connections of phAIP and aSMG during execution of\nactions: biological actions (blue) tool actions (blue+ red). Dashed\nlines: postulated connections; Abbreviations seeFigure 1.\nWith regard to aSMG, it has been demonstrated that this region\nis connected with vPMC and posterior middle temporal gyrus\n(pMTG; Ramayya et al., 2010). This latter region is presumed to\nrepresent the tool use associated motion (MTGt ; Chao et al., 1999;\nDevlin et al., 2002;Johnson-Frey et al., 2005;Mruczek et al., 2013),\ncorresponding to the “law” of the tool, i.e., deﬁning its nature (the\ntarget-movement mapping of the tool;Massen and Prinz, 2007).\nIt probably provides the main input to aSMG for its planning\nfunction. MTG\nt itself processes dynamic input (Beauchamp et al.,\n2002), and is located close to the MT cluster (Kolster et al., 2010),\nfrom which it may receive input. MTGt also receives input from\nthe fusiform gyrus representing semantic knowledge about tool\nproperties (LOC\nt ), a fusiform region also projecting directly to\naSMG (Mahon et al., 2007). Which exact part of LOC devoted\nto tools requires further exploration as more lateral regions have\nalso been implicated (Peelen et al., 2013; but see Mruczek et al.,\n2013). The connection between LOC\nt and aSMG, thus linking\nventral and dorsal streams, is similar in nature to that from\nLOC\no to phAIP . It is unclear to what extent aSMG needs visual\ninput from the ventro-dorsal stream. So far we have assumed\nthat aSMG receives no speciﬁc visual input. However, to utilize\nthe tool, it has to be positioned appropriately with respect to the\ntarget object (consider a screwdriver and the slot in the screw);\nin addition once the tool is moving, the target is subject to its\ninﬂuence and will also be moving (in this instance the screw get-\nting deeper). Both aspects, as they relate to the application of\nthe law of the tool, may require visual input for proper assess-\nment. Possible sources of such information may be the dorsal\nIPS medial (DIPSM) or VIPS (Figure 3). In this way the aSMG\nregion subserves the tool-object relationship, while phAIP takes\ncare of the tool-actor relationship (Osiurak et al., 2009). Finally,\naSMG is likely to receive tactile input indicating whether and how\nthe tool is being held by the hand. These inputs may originate in\nneighboring SII and reach aSMG directly or indirectly via phAIP .\nIndeed, the anterior part of monkey AIP receives input from SII\n(Borra et al., 2008).\nHAND TOOL ACTION OBSERVATION\nDuring the observation of tool actions phAIP and aSMG again\noperate in parallel and again their outputs converge onto vPMC\n(Figure 4). Although the exact homology of vPMC is under inves-\ntigation ( Orban et al., 2012) it likely includes the homolog of\nmonkey F5c, an area which contains the mirror neurons. This\nconvergence is supported by the evidences that, in trained mon-\nkeys, the observation of tool use triggers activity in hand grasping\nmirror neurons (Rochat et al., 2010), even if the ﬁring rate of these\nneurons was higher during hand grasping observation. Further-\nmore, the lack of interaction betweentool and action in the studies\nof Peeters et al. (2009, 2013), conﬁrmed that vPMC is as differ-\nentially active for observing biological actions as for tool actions.\nThe most plausible reason of this convergence in vPMC is that,\nduring both hand and tool action observation, the motor cor-\ntical areas respond in relation to the goal of the action, which\nis the same in both types of action, rather than to the move-\nment executed to accomplish the goal ( Järveläinen et al., 2004;\nCattaneo et al., 2009).\nIn the monkey the visual signals concerned with grasping obser-\nvation transit through two parietal stations, AIP and PFG (Nelissen\net al., 2011). The homolog of PFG (tentatively labeled phPFG) is\nstill unknown but some recent data (Ferri et al., 2013) suggest that\nit is located ventrally and slightly caudally from phAIP . The two\nparietal regions, AIP and PFG, receive input from monkey STS,\nmore precisely with middle superior temporal pole (STPm) in the\nupper bank feeding into PFG and a region in the rostral lower\nbank of STS located near that providing object property informa-\ntion, projecting to AIP . W e assume the same holds in humans and\ngiven the assumed homology (Jastorff and Orban, 2009;Jastorff\net al., 2012) of STPm with pMTG and of the rostral lower bank of\nSTS with lateral part of LOC (LOC\na ; Figure 1) we indicate such\nconnections in Figure 4. Both regions likely receive input indi-\nrectly from the MT cluster, which is very similar in monkeys and\nhumans (Kolster et al., 2009, 2010). In both species this cluster\nFIGURE 4| Connections of phAIP and aSMG during observations of\nactions: biological actions (blue) tool actions (red+ blue). Dashed\nlines: postulated connections; Abbreviations seeFigure 1.\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition April 2014| Volume 5| Article 310| 6\nOrban and Caruana The neural basis of human tool use\nincludes four areas sharing central representations in the center of\nthe cluster.\nWhile it is relatively clear how visual information about\nobserved biological actions reach phAIP , it is less clear how visual\nsignals related to observed tool actions reach aSMG. The most\nlikely origin is from posterior parietal cortex (PPC). One possibil-\nity is through DIPSM, another motion-sensitive region which is\nthe homolog of anterior LIP (Durand et al., 2009), also a motion-\nsensitive region in monkeys (Freedman and Assad, 2006; Orban\net al., 2006). LIP in the monkey receives from the MT cluster,\nand DIPSM likely does the same. The alternative is through VIPS,\nwhich we believe receives input from human V3A, which is also\nmotion-sensitive (T ootell et al., 1997), unlike it monkey counter-\npart (V anduffel et al., 2001). These routes over the PPC may explain\nwhy more parietal regions are activated by motion stimuli in\nhumans than in monkeys, whether by 3DSFM motion (V anduffel\net al., 2002) or translation (Orban et al., 2006).\nRELATIONSHIP WITH NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL AND\nCOGNITIVE STUDIES\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TOOL ACTIONS AND AFFORDANCES\nA difﬁculty in studying brain mechanisms involved in tool use\narises in attempting to formalize for scientiﬁc purposes the folk\ncategory of tool. In fact, each deﬁnition of a tool, attempting to dis-\ntinguish between tool use and other behaviors, has proven elusive\nand often led to paradoxical conclusions. Hence, many investi-\ngations into what would correspond to tool use have generally\nconcluded that this behavioral category is arbitrarily drawn, and\nthat any deﬁnition of tool use is one of convenience rather than\npsychological (Beck, 1980; Preston, 1998; Osiurak et al., 2010).\nPart of the problem arises from studies in animals, for which the\ndistinction between tool use and other purposeful behavior using\nnatural materials such as branches, e.g., building a nest, is less\nclear. These difﬁculties also reﬂect the fact that humans, who use\ntools proﬁciently, use many different types of artifacts with diverse\ngoals, i.e., extending various natural actions, e.g., using a car or\na riﬂe. The solution might be that a tool is any artifact extend-\ning the class of manipulative actions, with the understanding that\ntools will generally be man-made artifacts for humans, but not for\nanimals. Can a spoon or a knife be considered a tool? The answer\ndepends very much on the goal (Osiurak et al., 2010): if they are\nused to eat, rather than to cook or prepare food, they may not,\nstrictly speaking, belong to the category of tools, if we deﬁne tools\nas artiﬁcial implements intended to extend human manipulative\ncapability. The same applies to a toothbrush (Sunderland et al.,\n2013), which extends the interaction capabilities with the own\nbody and not with external objects. Recent evidence (Ferri et al.,\n2013) indicates that viewing actions directed to the own body acti-\nvates different parietal regions from viewing manipulation. While\nthe boundaries of what counts as a tool are still fuzzy, a number\nof manipulable objects can clearly not be considered tools and we\nwould emphasize the need for greater care in the selection of the\nappropriate stimuli for studying tool use. In contrast, some studies\nmake the opposite error, considering typical tools such as ham-\nmers or saws to be objects (Kalénine et al., 2010), and erroneously\nlabeling the aSMG as a region involved in action understanding in\ngeneral.\nA different sort of inappropriate stimuli concerns the use of\nstatic images instead of movies. The dynamical aspects, such as\nkinematics, are intrinsic characteristics of the tool actions detected\nby aSMG and for this reason static photographs of a gesture (Osiu-\nrak et al., 2009; Bach et al., 2010) are not optimal stimuli for\nstudying this region. Indeed, we used static gestures as control\nconditions. Finally, tool use implies a goal to be accomplished\nand for this reason one has to take care how pantomime tests\nare performed: if they simply imitate tool manipulation without\naddressing any goal (Osiurak et al., 2009), they may not actually\nﬁt the deﬁnition of a tool actionwhich, by deﬁnition, has a goal.\nIn fact, while little is known about the selectivity of aSMG for the\ngoal of the action, it is well known that other regions involved in\ntool use show dramatic changes in activity between observing an\nobject-directed tool action and observing the same actions devoid\nof any goal, i.e., when the object on which the tool operates is\nlacking (Järveläinen et al., 2004;Cattaneo et al., 2009).\nThe distinction between planning object-directed actions using\nthe natural effectors and planning actions directed to the same\nobject but using tools is consistent with the view (Osiurak et al.,\n2009) that affordances apply to tools only insofar as they are objects\nthat can be grasped. Considering only tool affordances to gain\ninsight into the use of tools may be counterproductive, as these\ncharacteristics fail to consider the relationship between the tool\nand the object, or target, of the tool action, e.g., the nail when\nusing a hammer, or the screw when using a screwdriver (Osiu-\nrak et al., 2009). Affordances are egocentric, while we need an\nallocentric framework to plan tool use, particularly that of novel\ntools (Osiurak, 2013). Hence, it is highly unlikely that only the\naffordance of tools, even very familiar ones, can explain the repe-\ntition suppression effects observed byV alyear et al. (2012)during\ntool observation. Indeed the suppression effects were induced by\nrepeated visual presentation of a tool, and not by repeating the tool\naction. Hence these effects are unlikely to track the existence of spe-\ncialized neuronal mechanisms for the use of these familiar tools,\nthe more that repetition suppression is known to overestimate\nselectivity (Sawamura et al., 2006).\nThe relationship between tool use and affordances can be clar-\niﬁed using Figure 3. It indicates that the tool action planning\nnetwork is more complex, as two parietal regions are involved in\nplanning tool use: phAIP to grasp the tool and aSMG to move it\naccording to its nature. Considering the ﬁnal goal to be reached by\nthe tool action, affordances apply only to the phAIP component\nof the planning, which is indeed the component common to both\nobjects and tools (Figure 5). However, this does not exclude the\npossibility that aSMG send some biasing signal to phAIP to favor\nthe selection of the affordance that best suits the proper use of the\ntool. The phAIP affordance component uses the visual analysis\nof size and shape to plan the appropriate grip aperture, a func-\ntion commonly associated with the canonical neurons described\nin monkey AIP and F5, i.e., with the ventro-dorsal stream, unlike\nwhat is proposed byOsiurak (2013). That visual analysis generally\nyields several affordances, one of which has to be selected accord-\ning to the goal of the action and the agent’s intentions, a function\nin which prefrontal cortex (PFC) afferents to AIP may play a role.\nAs far as tool grasping is concerned, aSMG is the primary candi-\ndate region for signaling the most appropriate affordance to phAIP .\nwww.frontiersin.org April 2014| Volume 5| Article 310| 7\nOrban and Caruana The neural basis of human tool use\nFIGURE 5| Relationship of wiring diagram of phAIP and aSMG (execution) to cognitive processes indicated as yellow boxes with green outlines:\naffordances, technical reasoning, and sematic knowledge.\nThis view is supported by the ﬁnding that patients with ideomotor\napraxia perform more poorly in grasping tools correctly than in\ngrasping abstract objects (Sunderland et al., 2013), thus suggesting\nthat the selection of the more appropriate grip of a tool depends\non both phAIP coding multiple affordances and aSMG providing\nknowledge of thelaw of the tool.\nAPRAXIA AND MECHANICAL PROBLEM SOLVING IN TOOL USE\nThe left lateralization of the planning of tool use is consis-\ntent the observation made repeatedly, that tool use is deﬁ-\ncient in apraxia due to left parietal lesions ( Goldenberg and\nHagmann, 1998). The difﬁculty has been in appreciating that\nthe various symptoms included in apraxia, typically deﬁcits\nin imitation of meaningless gestures and in tool use, need\nnot to be necessarily related. Attempts have been made to\nlink these two deﬁcits and ﬁnd a common underlying fac-\ntor such as the analysis of spatial relationships ( Goldenberg,\n2009), but recent studies have challenged this view show-\ning that apraxic patients perform more poorly in tool-related\nactions than in hand actions, even if the demands of these\ntasks on postural or spatial representation are identical ( Sun-\nderland et al., 2013 ). The common association of deﬁcits in\nreproducing meaningless gestures and tool use may simply indi-\ncate that the neural mechanisms of these two activities while\ndistinct, occupy neighboring IPL regions. This juxtaposition\ncould explain their common involvement in lesions which are\ngenerally due to stroke and typically involve large areas of\ncortex. More fundamental and productive was the realization\nthat the use of familiar tools which is generally impaired in\napraxia may in fact be dependent on two distinct mechanisms\n(Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009). One concerns semantic knowledge\nof the conventional use of familiar tools and the other the infer-\nence of function from structure (Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998;\nDaprati and Sirigu, 2006), also referred to as mechanical prob-\nlem solving (Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009) or technical reasoning\n(Osiurak et al., 2010).\nThe present review provides clear indications regarding the\nneural pathways that may underlie semantic knowledge of the\nconventional use of familiar tools, a circuit which relies on the\nLOC\nt and MTGt , two areas providing input to the aSMG. Thus\naSMG indeed constitutes the entry point of semantic informa-\ntion into the dorsal pathway, extending what was already known\nabout AIP/phAIP . In contrast, the present review has provided\nno additional information with regard to the other component\nof tools use, mechanical problem solving, which can be applied\nto new tools as well as to non-conventional uses of familiar\ntools. This type of reasoning refers to the ability to contem-\nplate the abstract principles and mechanics involved in tool\nuse, and is based on mental simulations (Hegarty, 2004) relying\non high-level allocentric spatial representations (Osiurak, 2013)\nand analog processes involved in rule-based reasoning. Impor-\ntantly, technical reasoning does not require semantic knowledge\n(Osiurak et al., 2010). Indeed, a decision that the tip of a screw-\ndriver is appropriate for the groove in a particular screw is\nrelatively independent of our semantic knowledge about screw-\ndrivers, in that the relevant information for turning screws is\nthe ﬁt of the tip of one object, whatever its’ nature (a screw-\ndriver, a knife, or a coin), into the slot of the other object.\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition April 2014| Volume 5| Article 310| 8\nOrban and Caruana The neural basis of human tool use\nThat aspect suggests some interesting parallelism with affordances,\nwhich also do not require explicit knowledge of object identity,\nthe main difference being that during tool use the hand-object\nrelationship, typical of affordances, is replaced by the relation-\nship between the tool and its receiver object ( Osiurak et al.,\n2010).\nThere is now mounting evidence from apraxia studies that\nmechanical problem solving/technical reasoning must be local-\nized in the left IPL (Goldenberg, 2009; Osiurak et al., 2010). One\npossibility is that the region located caudal to aSMG, between\naSMG and phAIP , extending toward the angular gyrus, is involved\nin this function (? in Figure 1). A possible indication is pro-\nvided by the originalPeeters et al. (2009). In this study, one of the\ntools, the screwdriver, was used in an unconventional way, to pick\nup an object. The activation for observing this action extended\nmuch further posterior that that evoked by observing the rake\nor the pliers being used conventionally (compare Figure 2B with\nFigures 2C,D in Peeters et al., 2009). The mechanical problem-\nsolving function was probably also active in the subjects ofStout\net al. (2011), who observed Acheulean tool making, compared to\nOldowan tool making. Again, the activation common to all type\nof subjects (novices, trained, experts) extended further caudally\n(LM −50, −36, 42) compared to the aSMG as deﬁned inPeeters\net al. (2009, 2013). Thus the aSMG (Figure 5) would be the entry-\npoint for not only semantic information into the dorsal stream,\nbut also for the output of technical reasoning, hence the locus of\nthe dialectic as described byOsiurak et al. (2010).\nTHE ORIGIN OF aSMG DURING THE EVOLUTION\nAs mentioned earlier the chimpanzee tool use differs fundamen-\ntally from that of humans ( Osiurak et al., 2010; V aesen, 2012),\ndepending primarily on a modiﬁcation of the biological grasp-\ning circuit centered on AIP . This is supported by recent evidence\nthat chimpanzees differ as much from humans as macaques do\nwith respect to action observation (Hecht et al., 2013). Hence the\nquestion arises as to when tool use based on left aSMG arose dur-\ning evolution. The ﬁrst ancestors equipped with this new neural\napparatus were most likely Homo Habilis, associated with the\nOldowan industrial complex or Homo Erectus, associated with\nthe Acheulean industrial complex. The former dates back 2.5 mil-\nlion years, the second to 1.7 million years before present (Asfaw\net al., 1992; Susman, 1994;Roche et al., 1999). Either choice would\nplace the development of tool use, between the emergence of the\ntwo other main human traits, bipedalism and language. Bipedal-\nism can be traced back to the Australopithecus, a species much\nolder than Homo Ergaster or Erectus, that emerged about 4 mil-\nlion years ago (W ood and Baker, 2011). However, Homo erectus\nwas probably the ﬁrst fully ﬂedged biped (Ruff, 2009). Language\non the other hand is a much more recent acquisition and may be\nas recent as 600 thousand years, or less, following the emergence\nof the premodern homo (Coqueugniot et al., 2004), who was a\nmaker of composite tools.\nThis timing suggests that these three developments may to some\ndegree be interdependent. Indeed bipedalism frees the hands for\nmanipulative purposes, and must have been an important step\ntoward tool use, insofar as tools are obviously manipulated by the\nhand. One possibility is that a region such as AIP was duplicated\nby a prolongation of the cell cycle and this region gradually came\nto be controlled by afferents carrying tool use related signals. On\nthe other hand, if tool use did indeed precede the emergence of\nlanguage, it may help understand the typical left lateralization of\nlanguage. Indeed tool use may in fact have triggered the develop-\nment of technical reasoning in left IPL, which in turn may have\nfavored a development of language in the left hemisphere. The\nlink between the emergence of tool making and language dur-\ning evolution has been postulated previously (Stout et al., 2008;\nStout and Chaminade, 2012). This view receives support from the\ninvolvement of certain IPL regions neighboring those involved in\ntechnical reasoning in literacy (Carreiras et al., 2009), the under-\nstanding of words, and probably also the planning of speech\n(W ernicke area or Spt, Hickok and Poeppel, 2007 ). An evolu-\ntionary link is also supported by the modest asymmetry favoring\nthe left hemisphere which has been observed in non-human pri-\nmates (Joly et al., 2012). It has been argued that the left asymmetry\nof language is much clearer for execution than for understanding\n(Hickok and Poeppel, 2007). Execution includes the planning of\nspeech and thus a parietal component, and we may consider W er-\nnicke’s area as a region of sensori-motor transformation (Cogan\net al., 2014), just as most other PPC regions.\nCONCLUSION\nA large body of imaging studies implicates the left aSMG region as\nan area involved in the execution and observation of tool actions.\nThe present review has attempted to make the implications of these\nﬁndings explicit, particularly with respect to pathways centered on\nthe anterior parietal sulcus regions: phAIP and aSMG, the latter\nappearing to be a specialization of phAIP for manipulating com-\nplex tools. Switching from hand to tool action requires, besides the\nvisual input regarding features of the target object provided by the\nIPS to phAIP and aSMG (for hand-object and tool-object inter-\naction, respectively), additional information speciﬁc to tool use\nand presumably converging upon aSMG. These afferents include\nsemantic information, which is particularly relevant when using\nfamiliar tools, technical reasoning, more crucial during the use of\nuncommon or new tools, and somatosensory feedback. It follows\nthat the affordances of a tool cannot, by themselves, account for\ntool use. Furthermore, postural and intentional constraints also\nplay a role during the planning of tool actions and consequently\nare probably provided by inputs to aSMG, which were not dis-\ncussed. This connectivity model is clearly more elaborated than\nthe two substreams of the dorsal visual pathway. At present it dis-\nplays a partial convergence with recent neuropsychological views\nin so far as the semantic input required for familiar tool use has\nbeen identiﬁed with some degree of conﬁdence, while the cortical\nlocalization of technical reasoning can only be conjectured. These\nviews also provide new support for the link between tool-making\nand language emergence during evolution.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by ERC Parietalaction to Guy A.
