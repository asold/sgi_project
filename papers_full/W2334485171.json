Ichinokura \nGraduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, 6-6-05 Aoba, Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8579, Japan \n \nMany offshore wind-power generators over MW-class are currently in operation in Europe and are now starting to be \nused in Japan. In order to develop large-scale offshore wind-power plants, we need to reduce the size and weight of power \nconverters, including isolating transformers. A dc-dc converter with a high-frequency transformer is one of the best ways \nto reduce the size and weight. However, copper loss of the transformer due to proximity effect is a problem because the \noperating frequency is increased from the commercial frequency to several kHz. In this work, we investigate an \ninterleaved winding arrangement for the high -frequency transformer. We compared the winding resistances of the \ninterleaved and non-interleaved winding arrangements in an experiment using a test amorphous transformer and found \nthat the interleaved winding arrangement inhibits the proximity effect and reduces the winding resistance. We designed \nan MW -class high -frequency amorpho us transformer with the interleaved winding and demonstrated its very high \nefficiency. \nKey words: dc-dc converter, amorphous transformer, interleaved winding, proximity effect \n \n1. Introduction \nOffshore wind-power generation is expected to \nsubstitute for conventional thermal power and nuclear \npower generations. In Europe, a large number of over \nMW-class offshore wind -power generators are already \noperated 1), and it has started in Japan. Such a large-scale \noffshore wind -power plant requires a MW -class dc -dc \nconverter to efficient ly send the generated power by high \nvoltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system 2). \nFig. 1 shows a basic configuration of the wind-power \ngeneration system by HVDC. In the system, a permanent \nmagnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is employed  \nbecause of high power, high efficiency, and maintenance \nfree operation. The dc -dc converter requires a MW -class \ntransformer for isolating and boosting. \nTo reduce size and weight of such a large -capacity \ntransformer, an amorphous core is employed and its \noperating frequency is increased from commercial \nfrequency to several -kHz. However, it is expected that \ncopper loss of the transformer becomes large  due to \nproximity effect \n3). \nTo overcome the above problem, this paper investigates \nan interleaved winding arrangement. First, leakage flux \ndistribution and current density distribution of the \ninterleaved and non -interleaved windings are compared \nby using finite elemen t method (FEM).

Comparison of the winding arrangements based on \nmeasurement and calculation   \n2.1  Calculated results \nFig. 2(a) illustrates shape and winding arrangement of \na test amorphous transformer with the non-interleaved \nwinding, and (b) shows with the interleaved winding. The \nheight, width, and thickness of the transformer are 235 \nmm, 135 mm, and 95 mm, respectively. As shown in the \nfigures, the winding shape is rectangular, and its size is 7 \nmm width by 0.8 mm thickness. The numbers of the \nprimary and secondary windings are 96 each. \nIn the FEM calculation, the primary winding is excited \nby ideal sinusoidal current, and the secondary winding is \nshorted in  the same way as a short -circuit test of the \ntransformer. The electric resistivity of the primary and \nsecondary wires  is 2.52 × 10\n-8 ·m and the relative \npermeability of the magnetic core is 5000. \nFigs. 3 and 4 indicate leakage flux density distribution \naround the non -interleaved and interleaved winding s at \nan operating frequency of 3 kHz. The figures reveal that \nthe interleaved winding arrangement can significantly \nreduce the leakage flux around the windings. \nFigs. 5 and 6 show current density distribution of the \nnon-interleaved and interleaved windings and their  \nenlarged view s. It is understood that the current \ndistribution of the non -interleaved winding is \nnon-uniform due to the proximity effect.

The figure \nreveals that the winding resistance of the non-interleaved \nwinding is increas ed remarkably in the same manner as \nthe calculation result shown in Fig.  7. It is proved \nexperimentally that the interleaved winding arrangement \ncan significantly reduce the winding resistance.  The \ncauses of error between the calculated and measured \nvalues of non -interleaved winding arrangement could be \nthat the calculated values are obtained from the 2D-FEM. \n \n3. Design of high-frequency amorphous transformer for \nMW-class dc-dc converters   \n3.1  Specifications of MW-class amorphous transformer \nBased on the above results, a MW -class amorphous \ntransformer with the interleaved winding is designed and \ncompared to the transformer with the non -interleaved \nwinding. In the  design of the amorphous transformer, \ninsulation distance of the adjacent windings  is different \naccording to t he winding arrangement. The insulation \ndistance of the non-interleaved winding arrangement is 1 \nmm, while the insulation distance of the interleaved \nwinding arrangement is increased to 5 mm because the \nprimary and secondary windings are adjacent to each \nother. \nTable 1 shows specifications of the amorphous \ntransformer for MW-class dc-dc converters. A turn ratio of \nthe transformer is 10.  \nFig. 10 illustrates shape and winding arrangement of \nthe amorphous transformers for MW -class dc-dc \nconverters, which  satisfy the required specifications \nshown in Table 1. The height, width, and thickness of the \ntransformer with the non-interleaved winding  are 321 \nmm, 234 mm, and 2 02 mm, respectively. On the other \nhand, the height, width, and thickness of the transformer \nwith the interleaved winding are  321 mm, 338 mm, and \n202 mm, respectively. As shown in the figure, the winding \nshape is rectangular . The size of the primary winding is \n100 mm width by 2.0 mm thickness , while the size of the \nsecondary winding is 10 mm width by 2.0 mm thickness . \nThe numbers of the primary and secondary windings are \n14 and 140, respectively. \n \nT\nable 1  Specifications of the amorphous transformer for \nMW-class dc-dc converters. \nFrequency f  3 kHz \nRated power P 1.0 MW \nInput voltage V1 1.65 kV \nOutput voltage V2 16.5 kV \nMax. flux density Bm 1.0 T \nCurrent density J 3 A/mm2 \n \n   \n(a) Non-interleaved winding arrangement \n \n(b) Interleaved winding arrangement \nFig. 10  Shape and winding arrangement of the \namorphous transformers for MW-class dc-dc converters. \n100 1000 100000.1\n1\n10\n100\nFrequency  f (Hz)\n r  ()\nNon-interleaved\nInterleaved\n100\n2\n10\n1\n20\n1\n2\n321\n234\n109\n56\n56\nThickness: 202\n(unit: mm)\n1\nPrimary\nwinding Secondary\nwinding\n56\n2 1020\n5\n2\n321\n338\n109\n100\n56\nThickness: 202\n(unit: mm)\n1\nPrimary\nwinding\nSecondary\nwinding\n37Journal of the Magnetics Society of Japan Vol.40, No.2, 2016\n3.2  Calculated results \nFig. 11 indicates calculated frequency dependence of \ncopper losses of the MW-class transformers. In the FEM \ncalculation, the primary winding is excited by the ideal \nsinusoidal current, and the secondary winding is shorted . \nThe figure reveals that the copper loss of the \nnon-interleaved winding is increased considerably,  and \nthat the interleaved winding arrangement can \nremarkably reduce the copper loss.  \nTable 2 shows calculated loss es of the MW-class \ntransformers.

The parameters Ah, Ae, and Aa can be found by \napproximating Wi / f – f curves of core material based on \nleast-square method as shown in Fig. 12. The parameters \nAh, Ae, and Aa are obtained as Ah = 4.31 × 10 –3, Ae = 1.81 × \n10 –7, and Aa = 6.38 × 10 –5, respectively. \nIt is understood from Table 2 that the interleaved \nwinding arrangement is very useful for the \nhigh-frequency transformer of the MW -class dc-dc \nconverters from the view point of the copper loss and the \nthermal design. \n \n \nFig. 11  Calculated frequency dependence of copper losses \nof the MW-class amorphous transformers. \n \nTable 2  Calculated losses of the MW- class amorphous \ntransformers ( f = 3 kHz). \n Non-interleaved \nwinding arrangement \nInterleaved winding \narrangement \nCore loss \nWi  (kW) 1.5 1.8 \nCopper loss \nWc (kW) 28.6 1.5 \nTotal loss \nWi+Wc (kW) 30.1 3.3 \nTransformer \nefficiency (%) 97.0 99.7 \n \nFig. 12  Wi /f - f curves and their approximate curves of \namorphous core. \n \n4. Conclusion \nThis paper investigated the winding arrangement of \nthe high-frequency amorphous transformer for MW -class \ndc-dc converters. By comparing the frequency \ndependences of the winding resistance of the interleaved \nand non -interleaved winding  arrangements, it was clear \nthat the interleaved winding arrangement can \nsignificantly reduce the winding resistance. \nIn addition, the 1.0 MW amorphous transformer with \nthe interleaved winding was designed. It was found that \nthe interleaved winding arrangement is very useful for  \nthe MW -class high-frequency amorphous transformer \nfrom the view point of the copper loss reduction. \nThis work was supported by Grant -in-Aid for JSPS \nFellows (26-5193). \n \nR\neferences \n1) J.
