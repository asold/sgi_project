    "abstract": "Abstract The wireless communication technology develop rapidly, signal modulation mode technology becomes increasingly important. Therefore, in order to enhance the ability of radio signal modulation mode recognition in the complex electromagnetic environment, a novel radio signal modulation mode recognition method is proposed on account of Transformer network. Firstly, raw data were split with a fixed size window. Then, the segmented data was projected into a vector sequence and fed into the Transformer module to model and mine the relationship between signal waveform and modulation method to achieve identification. Extensive experiments were conducted on the RML2016.10a data set generated by GNU radio in the real system. The experimental results show that the proposed Transformer-B/8×2 achieves optimal results for modulation mode recognition with signal-to-noise from -20dB to 18dB, and recognition accuracy reaches 86.75%, verifying the practicability and validity of the forenamed algorithm.",
