    "abstract": "The use of microprocessor devices for relay protection and automation, devices for measuring and determining electric power quality permits the introduction and development of digital circuits leading from primary current and voltage transformers. The use of optical channels for digital circuits addresses the problem of offsetting electromagnetic interference and voltage shift. Creating optical and digital current and voltage transformers with digitization of signals already at high measuring transformer voltage is the best solution for the above problem of mechanical engineering in the field of electromagnetic compatibility of high voltage measuring transformers. However, a difficulty arises in ensuring electromagnetic compatibility of sensors and microelectronic equipment adjoining live parts. The present study is devoted to examining the impact of electromagnetic fields on sensors and solving the problems of electromagnetic compatibility of optical and digital current and voltage transformers.",
