They can step down high voltages in \ntransmission at substations or step up currents to the \nneeded level of endNusers. Additionally, many functions, \nlike, isolation, noise decoupling or phaseNshifting can be \nachieved through transformers. The traditional \ndistribution transformer has many disadvantages \nincluding being heavy and bulky, secondary voltage \nvaries with the load and input voltage, lack of sel f \nprotection, having no ability of voltage and curren t \ncontrol, not having an intelligent function and the  \nexpensive components in electrical power system \n(Ratanapanachote, 2004). \nIn this study, a new type of Power Electronics \ndistribution Transformer (PET) is proposed, which \nrealizes the voltage transformation, galvanic isola tion \nand power quality improvements in one device. The \nproposed PET design is fundamentally different and \nmore complete approach by using power electronics o n \nthe primary and secondary sides of the transformer.  \nSeveral features such as instantaneous voltage \nregulation, voltage sags compensation and power fac tor \ncorrection can be combined into PET. In addition, t he \nPET is environmentally friendly since no liquid \ndielectrics are used for cooling. PET can be equipp ed \nwith advanced communication interface that includes  \nsmart metering, diagnostics and distance control features \n(Subramanya and Anjaneyulu, 2012). The distribution  \ntransformer can be classified as shown in Fig. 1.  \nThe prominent challenges in the new design of PET \nare to achieve smaller core size, higher power qual ity, \nhigher efficiency and minimum losses. The main \nchallenge is how to increase the efficiency of PET.  The \ngeneral objective of this research is to introduce and \nelaborate a new design approach for a PET system th at \ncan improve the performance of commercial power \nelectronic transformers. In particular this study aims at: \n \n• Design a new PET \n• Optimize the design to achieve best tradeNoffs of \nhighest efficiency, highest power quality, minimum \nsize and minimum losses \n• Prototyping and experimenting the design \n \nLITERATURE \n REVIEW \n \nThis section presents the different topologies for \nPET, in recent 30 years. The first idea of a power \nelectronic transformer has been introduced by Navy \nresearchers 1980, that consisted of an AC/AC buck \nconverter as shown in Fig. 2 to reduce the input vo ltage \nto a lower one (Brooks, 1980). This was followed in  \n1995 by a similar Electrical Power Research Institu te \n(EPRI) sponsored effort (Resischi, 1995). Both of t hese \nefforts yielded working prototypes, but they operat ed at \npower and primary voltage levels that were orders o f \nmagnitude below utility distribution levels. \nIn1996 the next attempt of a High Frequency (HF) \nAC link, termed an electronic transformer, was \nproposed. In this approach, the line side AC wavefo rm \nis modulated into a HF square wave coupled to the \n \n \nRes. J. App. Sci. Eng.

But it does not provide any  \nbenefit in term of control and power factor improvement \nand may not protect critical loads from momentary \npower interruptions due to the lack of an energy st orage \nsystem (Harada, 1996; Kang et al ., 1999; Krishnaswami \nand Ramanarayanan, 2005).  \nFigure 4 shows that the other type is a threeNpart \ndesign that utilizes an input stage, an isolation stage and \nan output stage, as addressed in Ronan et al . (2002), \nImanNEini and Farhangi (2006), ImanNEini et al . (2008), \nMaitra  et  al . (2009), Wang et al . (2005) and JihNSheng \net al . (2005). The first stage is an AC/DC converter \nwhich is utilized to form the input current, to correct the \ninput power factor and to regulate the voltage of t he \nprimary DC bus. The second stage is an isolation st age \nwhich provides the galvanic isolation between the \nprimary and secondary side. In the isolation stage,  the \nDC voltage is converted to a high frequency square \nwave voltage, coupled to the secondary of the HF \ntransformer and is rectified to form the DC link voltage. \n\n \n \nRes.

This \napproach can perform different power quality functi ons \nand can provide galvanic isolation but they need ei ther \ntoo much power electronic converters or DCNlink \nelectrolytic capacitors. The main disadvantage of t his \ntopology is the large number of components which \nresults in possibly lower efficiency and reliabilit y. \nMoreover in the near future it may be possible to b e \ncommercialized. The literature review data are \nsummarized in the Table 1. \nMETHODOLOGY \n   \nThis study is suggested to be carried out in three \nsteps, which are: \n \nPhase A: \n \n• Literature review:  The state of the art and basic \nconcepts of knowledge will be revised while related \nliterate and relevant data of PET will be collected . \nConsequently, the main feature of the proposed \nwork will be pointed out. \n \n \nRes. J. App. Sci. Eng. Technol., 7(9): 1734q1743, 2014 \n \n1737 \n \nPhase B: \n \n• Simulation and theoretical analysis:  MATLAB \nANN software will be used to obtain the optimum \nPET design parameter and then the efficiency result \nwill be checked against the traditional transformer. \n• Design the closed loop control for PFT. \n• Testing:  PET system will be tested under different \nload condition.  \n• The full scale prototype will be made for testing \nand the result will be compared with theoretical \nanalysis and simulation. \n \nPhase C: \n \n• Analysis of the result:  The results arising from \nstep B above are tabulated and analyzed. \n• Conclusion and recommendations will be drawn \nfrom the analysis.    \n \nPROPOSED \n TOPOLOGY \n \nThe new proposed topology of power electronic \ntransformer will have a three stages including; an input \nstage,  isolation  stage  and output stage, as show n in \nFig. 5. The input stage consists of three phase, th ree \nlevel PWM rectifier that reduces the  stress  ratio  of  the \ncomponent, where the reactive power and highNvoltage \ndcNlink voltage closedNloop controls provide the ability \nto adjust the reactive power and stabilize the dcNl ink \nvoltage in the highNvoltage side and improve the \nefficiency. The isolation stage employs three level  half \nbridge convertor connected with high frequency \ntransformer. The output stage has a matrix converter that \nis used to replace the rectifier and the inverter t o reduce \nthe isolation stage component resulting in an effic iency \nimprovement. On the other hand, the optimum design of \nHF transformer is done by ANN to reduce the losses.  \n \nPET mathematical model: By analyzing the new \ntopology of PET, the structure consists of the inpu t \nstage, middle stage and output stage (Fig. 6 and 7). \nBefore developing the PET models, we assume that \nthe power system is symmetrical and operates under a \nthree phase balanced condition. By neglecting the VSCs \nlosses, the dynamic differential equations of VSCN1 , \nVSCN2 and the modulatingNdemodulating block are \n(Wang et al ., 2007):  \n \n11\n1\n1 E\nE\nE uudt\ndIL −=                               (1) \n \n22\n2\n2 E\nE\nE uudt\ndIL −=                 (2) \n \n \n \nFig. 5: Methodology flow chart \n \n \nRes.

The \ncontrol scheme developed in rotating dNq reference \nframe would lead to better performance (Wang et al ., \n2007). The mathematical models of the input stage are: \n \ndEdqEE\ndE\nE uuiLdt\ndIL 1111\n1\n1 −+= ω                 (28) \n \nqEqdEE\nqE\nE uuiLdt\ndIL 1111\n1\n1 −+= ω              (29) \n \nTo implement the above functions, in the outerNloop \ncontrol, the feedback DC voltage is compared to the \nreference value. The difference is then passed thro ugh \nthe PI controlled to get the reference value of dNa xis \ncurrent. When the reference value of qNaxis current is set \nto zero, the rectifier can achieve unity power fact or \noperation. In the innerNloop, threeNphase input currents \nare transformed into dNaxis current and qNaxis curr ent \ncomponents in the synchronous rotating dNq referenc e \nframe. The components are compared with the reference \nvalues of both dNaxis current and qNaxis current, th e \ndifferences then formed the modulated wave signal b y \nthe PI controller.

When the load \nchanges within a certain range, the PET should main tain \nthe amplitude of the output voltage. The control \nprinciple diagram is shown in Fig. 10. The threeNph ase \noutput voltages are converted to the dNaxis u \nE2d  and qN\naxis u E2q  in the synchronous rotating dNq reference \nframe, respectively. The voltage is then compared w ith \nthe reference values of u E2 dref and u E2 qref . The modulated \nsignal is formed by the PI controller.

T he \noptimization of the whole system will be achieved b y \nusing close loop control, best core size, optimal \nfrequency operation and reducing the number of \ncomponents. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n \nThe author would like to thank the Universiti \nTeknologi PETRONAS for funding this research project \nunder the “Graduate Assistantship Scheme”. \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBrooks, J.L., 1980.
