Introduction \nSignificant progress has been made in the field of natural language processing with the advent of \nlarge language models. Examples of these models include OpenAI’s GPT -X [1] and Google’s \nBERT [2] models. These models are transformative because they can understand, generate, and \nmanipulate human language at an unprecedented scale. Vast Large language models are typically \ntrained on datasets that encompass a significant portion of the internet ’s text, enabling them to \nlearn the complexities of language and context.  These models are built upon a neural network \narchitecture called transformers  [3]. The transformer  architecture revolutionized NLP due to its \nparallelization, scalability, and ability to  capture long -range dependencies in text. Instead of \nrelying on recurrent or convolutional layers, transformers use self -attention mechanisms, as \npreviously described, which allow them to assess the importance of every word in a sentence when \nunderstanding context. This innovation is key to their remarkable performance. \nThe training regimen for large language models comprises two phases: pre-training and fine-tuning. \nDuring pre-training, the model is trained on an extensive corpus of text data to acquire proficiency \nin grammar, factual knowledge, reasoning abilities, and word understanding. Fine-tuning tailors \nthese models for specific tasks like translation, summarization, or question -answering. The \nadaptability of large language models is a major advantage; they can excel at  various NLP tasks \nwithout task -specific architectures.  However, they have found applications in diverse fields \nbeyond NLP, including biology, healthcare, education, finance, customer service, and more.  In \nparticular, there have been many successful applications of large language models in the field of \nbioinformatics. In this manuscript, we focus on the applications of large language models to \nseveral bioinformatic tasks through five areas:  DNA level, RNA level, protein level , drug \ndiscovery and single-cell analysis. Applications of LLMs in genomics focus on LLMs using DNA \nsequence; applications of LLMs focus on in transcriptomics using RNA sequence; applications of \nLLMs in proteomics focus on LLMs using protein sequence; a pplications of LLMs in drug \ndiscovery focus on LLMs using Molecular SMILES (seq) and applications of LLMs in single-cell \nanalysis focus on LLMs using scRNA-seq, scMulti-omics and spatial transcriptomics data (Figure \n1). \n \n2. Understanding the Building Blocks of Large Language Models in Bioinformatics \nBuilding large language models involves several critical components, including tokenization \nmethods, embedding techniques, attention mechanisms, transformer architectures, and the training \nprocesses for large-scale models. Each of these elements plays a vital role in enabling the models \nto process, understand, and generate complex data. \n2.1 Tokenization and input embedding \nTokenization methods are essential for processing raw input data, breaking it down into smaller, \nmanageable units (tokens) that can be analyzed and processed by models. The choice of \ntokenization method varies depending on the type of data being handled (Figure 2a, Table 1).  \nIn DNA and RNA sequence data, tokenization converts raw nucleotide sequences (A, T, C, G for \nDNA or A, U, C, G for RNA) into a numerical format suitabl e for computational models. A \ncommon method is one-hot encoding, where each nucleotide is represented as a binary vector with \na ‘1’ indicating its position (e.g., [1,  0, 0, 0] for A in DNA), as used in RNA -FM [4] and RNA-\nMSM [5]. Another widely adopted approach is k-mer tokenization, which segments sequences into \noverlapping substrings of fixed length ‘k’ (e.g., for k=3, “ATGC” becomes “ATG” and “TGC”). \nThis method is employed in models like DNABERT [6], DNAGPT  [7], and RNABERT  [8]. \nAdditionally, specialized tokens such as ‘[IND]’ can be introduced to mark the start or end of \nsequences or to handle unknown characters or gaps, as demonstrated in RNAErnie [9]. \nIn protein language models, the input data primarily includes multiple sequence alignments \n(MSAs), protein sequences, biomedical/biological text, and cDNA. The basic units of MSAs and \nprotein sequences are amino acids, leading most protein language models to use Single Amino \nAcid Tokenization, where protein sequences are segmented into individual amino acids. This \napproach is akin to the k -mers method used for DNA and RNA sequences and is employed in \nmodels such as ESM-1b [10], ProtTrans [11], and ProGen [12]. For biomedical and biological text, \nincluding general descriptions, conditioning tags in generative models, and resources like Gene \nOntology (GO), tokenization methods from natural language processing (NLP) are widely used. \nMethods like WordPiece Tokenization build vocabulary using frequency-based greedy algorithms \nand segment text into discrete tokens, as demonstrated in ProtST  [13]. For cDNA data, \ntokenization is similar to that of protein sequences but differs in the basic unit. Instead of amino \nacids, sequences are tokenized into codons, or triplets of nucleotides, as seen in CaLM [14]. \nIn drug discovery, small molecule drugs account for 98% of commonly used medications [1]. \nLLMs leverage four main tokenization methods to uncover molecular patterns and drug -target \ninteractions. Atom-level tokenization treats molecules as sequences of individual atoms, analogous \nto character-level text representation, as seen in K -BERT [15]. MolGPT [16] utilizes a SMILES \ntokenizer that segments molecular structures into units such as atoms, bond types, and ring markers. \nA Graph-based VQ-VAE approach enhances this by encoding atoms into context -aware discrete \nvalues, distinguishing roles like aldehyde versus ester carbons, based on latent codes derived from \na graph-based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ -VAE). This method categorizes \natoms into chemically meaningful sub -classes, enriching the molecular vocabulary. Fingerprint \ntokens, another met hod, represent molecules through binary or numerical vectors summarizing \nmolecular properties or structural patterns, as seen in SMILES-BERT [17].  \nTokenization methods for single -cell p rofiles include four main strategies. Gene \nranking/reindexing-based methods rank genes by expression levels and create tokens using ranked \ngene symbols or unique integer identifiers, as seen in Geneformer  [18] and tGPT [19]. Binning-\nbased methods divide gene expression into predefined intervals, assigning tokens based on the \ncorresponding bin, used in models like scBERT [20] and scGPT [21]. Gene set or pathway-based \nmethods group genes into biologically meaningful sets, such as pathways or Gene Ontology terms, \nwith tokens representing the activation of these sets, exemplified by TOSICA  [22]. Patch-based \nmethods segment gene expression vectors into equal -sized sub-vectors, as seen in CIForm [152]. \nAlternatively, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to transform the reshaped gene \nexpression matrix into several flattened 2D patches, as demonstrated by scTranSort [23]. Another \nvariation involves reshaping the sub-vectors into a gene expression matrix after segmentation, as \nemployed in scCLIP [24]. In addition to the four methods mentioned above, a more direct approach \ninvolves projecting g ene expression directly, as seen in models like scFoundation  [25], and \nscMulan [26]. Alternatively, some methods tokenize cells instead of genes, as exemplified by \nmodels such as CellPLM  [27], ScRAT [28], and mcBERT [29], which utilize cell tokens during \nmodel training  (Table 1 ). These strategies allow models to capture biological structure and \nvariability, tailoring tokenization to single-cell data characteristics.  \nAfter tokenization, embedding converts tokens into continuous vector representations, capturing \nthe semantic relationships between them. Positional encoding represents the token order by adding \nvectors that encode the relative or absolute positions of toke ns in the sequence. The final step \ninvolves combining the token embeddings with the positional embeddings to create a unified input \nembedding, which is then fed into the model for further processing (Figure 2b). \n2.2 Architecture of transformer models \nTransformers are the foundational architecture in large language models (LLMs) and consist of \ntwo main components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder takes the input data and processes \nit in parallel across multiple layers to capture relationships within the sequence. The decoder, on \nthe other hand, generates output sequences based on the encoder’s processed information, typically \nused in tasks like translation or text generation. Each component is built on layers of multi -head \nattention, add and norm layer, and feed-forward layer (Figure 2c). \nAttention Mechanism : A key innovation of the transformer is the attention mechanism, \nparticularly self-attention [3], which allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens \nin a sequence relative to each other. In self -attention, each token computes a score based on how \nmuch attention it should pay to other tokens in the sequence. This is done by calculating three key \ncomponents: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors for each token (Figure 2d). The attention \nscore is computed as the dot product between the Query of one token and the Key of another token, \nfollowed by a softmax operation to normalize the scores. These scores are then used to weight the \nValue vectors, which are aggregated to form the output representation for each token as following \n[3]: \n𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉) = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(\n𝑄𝐾𝑇\n√𝑑𝑘\n)𝑉                                           (1) \nMulti-head attention extends this idea by running multiple attention mechanisms (or “heads”) in \nparallel. Each attention head processes the input tokens in a slightly different way by using \ndifferent sets of learned weights for the Q, K, and V vectors. The results of all heads are \nconcatenated and linearly transformed, allowing the model to capt ure different aspects of \nrelationships between tokens simultaneously. This mechanism enables the model to focus on \nvarious parts of the input sequence at once, learning different types of interactions between tokens. \nFor example, in single -cell foundation models, self -attention can help identify important gene \ninteractions by determining which genes (tokens) should focus on each other during processing. \nIn this way, multi-head attention allows the model to capture complex relationships between genes \nin single-cell RNA-seq data, where multiple aspects of gene expression (such as co -expression \npatterns or functional relationships) need to be captured simultaneously.  \nAdd and norm layer: The add and norm layer performs layer normalization and residual \nconnections, which help stabilize training by ensuring that the output from each layer is added to \nthe input before being normalized. This allows for smoother gradient flow and avoids the vanishing \ngradient problem. \nFeed-forward layer: After the attention mechanism, the feed -forward network is a fully \nconnected neural network (Figure 2e), helping the model learn complex mappings and capture \nmore abstract representations of the input data. \n2.3 BERT and GPT models \nBERT and GPT stand as two exceptional language models. Both BERT and GPT leverage the \ntransformer architecture, employing attention mechanisms to grasp dependencies within input data. \nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) . BERT is basically an \nencoder stack of transformer architecture, which was introduced by Google in 2018 [2]. BERT is \ntrained using a bidirectional approach, meaning it considers context from both the left and right of \neach token during training. This enables BERT to capture richer, more context -aware \nrepresentations. BERT is typically pre-trained using a masked language model (MLM) task, where \nrandom tokens in a seq uence are masked, and the model is tasked with predicting them. This \nbidirectional training allows BERT to better understand the full context of a sequence or biological \nsentence, such as a cell (Figure 2f). For example, scBERT, a single -cell adaptation of BERT, \napplies this approach to single-cell RNA-seq data. By masking random gene tokens and predicting \nthem during pretraining, scBERT learns complex dependencies and co -expression patterns \nbetween genes. Th is enables it to capture the full transcriptional context of individual cells, \nimproving downstream tasks like cell type classification. \nGPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer ). Introduced by OpenAI  [1], GPT is based on a \ndecoder stack of transformer architecture . Unlike BERT, GPT uses a unidirectional training \napproach, processing the input sequence from left to right  (Figure 2 f). It is trained using \nautoregressive learning, where each token is predicted based on the previous ones, making it \nparticularly suited for generational tasks. GPT excels in zero-shot learning, where they perform \ntasks without needing task-specific training data. For example, DNAGPT leverages its pretrained \nknowledge to perform tasks like predicting DNA motifs or identifying regulatory elements without \nexplicit task-specific training. When prompted with a sequence such as “Find the transcription \nfactor binding motif in the following DNA sequence: AGCTTAGGCC...”, DNAGPT can identify \nor generate plausible motifs based on its understanding of DNA patterns learned during pretraining. \n \n3. Foundation models in bioinformatics \n3.1 Key components of biological foundation models \nFoundation models are a category of large -scale, pre-trained models designed to be versatile and \nadaptable to various downstream tasks. They are built upon several fundamental components that \nenable their widespread applicability and effectiveness across d omains. First, foundation models \nare trained on extensive and diverse datasets to capture broad, generalizable patterns. In single -\ncell biology, for example, datasets with millions of cells spanning multiple tissues and conditions \nare often used. Second, the architecture of foundation models is typically designed for flexibility \nand scalability. Their architecture, often transformer-based (e.g., GPT and BERT), are specifically \ndesigned for flexibility and scalability . Third, Self-supervised learning is a core training strategy \nfor foundation models. By creating tasks such as masked prediction, contrastive learning, or next-\ntoken prediction, models can learn representations without requiring labeled data. Fourth, \nfoundation models exhibit multi-task transferability, leveraging a two-step process of pre-training \nand fine-tuning (Figure 3). During pre-training, these models are trained on large -scale datasets \nto develop robust generalization capabilities by capturing broad patterns and knowledge. Fine -\ntuning involves adapting the pre-trained model to specific tasks by exposing it to unique data and \nadditional training. This approach enables foundation models to adjust effectively to diverse \napplications while maintaining their versatility across a wide range of domains. Last but not least, \ntraining foundation models requires significant computational resources, often involving GPU or \nTPU clusters. Foundation models typically feature billions or even trillions of parameters. \n3.2 Foundation models in different biological domains \nDNA foundation models. Currently, DNA sequence-based foundation models are powerful tools \nthat leverage advanced deep learning architectures to analyze and interpret genomic data  [30]. \nThese models are built on frameworks like BERT and GPT, which have been adapted for the \nspecific challenges of genomic sequences (Table 2). For example, DNABERT [6]is a BERT-based \nmodel trained on the human reference genome, enabling it to capture the contextual relationships \nbetween nucleotides and perform tasks such as sequence classification and variant prediction. \nExpanding beyond a single species, Nucleotide Transformer  [31] and Genomic Pre -trained \nNetwork (GPN) [32] are transformer-based models that incorporate the multiple species reference \ngenomes, providing a broader understanding of genomic diversity. DNABERT-2 [33] takes this a \nstep further by training on multi-species genomic data from 135 species, allowing for cross-species \ngenomic analysis. Similarly, GROVER [34], another BERT-based model, is focused on the human \nreference genome and is designed for applications such as understanding gene expression and \nfunctional genomics. On the other hand, DNAGPT, based on the GPT architecture, is trained not \nonly on the human reference genome but also on reference genomes from nine other species, \nfacilitating tasks such as sequence generation and evolutionary analysis. Together, these DNA \nsequence-based foundation models represent a leap forward in computational genomics, enabling \nmore accurate predictions, better understanding of genetic variation, and advancements in \npersonalized medicine. \nRNA foundation models. RNA sequence-based language models, particularly BERT -based and \nTransformer-based models, have gained significant traction in the analysis of RNA sequences due \nto their ability to understand the complex patterns and structures of RNA. These models are trained \nusing a wide variety of RNA types, including non -coding RNAs (ncRNAs), coding RNA, and \nuntranslated regions (UTRs), across diverse organisms  (Table 2). For instance, RNABERT  [8], \nRNA-FM [4], RNA-MSM [5], and UNI-RNA [35] focus on all ncRNA types from a broad range \nof species, enabling insights into RNA function and interactions. Models like SpliceBERT  [36] \nspecialize in coding RNA sequences from 72 vertebrates, while 3UTRBERT  [37] is specifically \ndesigned for human mRNA transcripts, particularly the 3' untranslated regions. Additionally, \nUTR-LM [38] focuses on 5' UTR sequences from five species, and RNAErnie [9], a Transformer-\nbased model, covers a wide range of ncRNAs. These models are part of a rapidly growing field \naimed at advancing RNA sequence analysis, facilitating the study of RNA biology and its role in \nvarious biological processes and diseases. Through the use of these RNA-based language models, \nresearchers can make significant strides in understanding RNA structure, function, and regulatory \nmechanisms. \nProtein foundation models.  Foundation models for proteins can be directly utilized to obtain \nhigh-quality protein embeddings and support various downstream applications. The foundational \nprotein models listed in Table 2  not only fulfill these requirements but also exhibit unique \ncharacteristics. For example, TAPE [39] made a significant contribution by introducing a \ncomprehensive benchmark for protein bioinformatics tasks. ESM-1b [40] applied the transformer \narchitecture of large language models in a highly standardized manner to protein representation \nlearning. This model has since been widely used to generate protein sequence embeddings, and its \nvariants can also be found via the sam e link provided in Table 2. ProtTrans [11], compared to \nESM-1b, significantly expanded the model architecture, the number of parameters, and the size of \nthe training dataset. It has been widely adopted as a frozen encoder for protein sequences. \nProtGPT2 [41], as its name suggests, extends GPT-2 into the protein domain (with links providing \ndetails on the GPT-2 training framework). Recent foundation models like ProtBert [42] and KeAP \n[43] integrate bio medical text information alongside protein sequences. Notably, KeAP \nincorporates a knowledge graph to enhance this integration . Both  models demonstrate that \nmultimodal fusion within proteomics often produces more expressive features. CaLM [14], on the \nother hand, represents proteins using cDNA, embedding cross-omics biological information. From \nthe perspective of algorithmic advancements, the integration of multimodal information within a \nsingle omics domain, as well as cross-omics data fusion, represents key strategies for constructing \nunified large-scale biological models. \nDrug discovery foundation models. It has been postulated that the total number of potential drug \nlike candidates range from 10 23 to 10 60 molecules[44]. Foundation models leverage diverse \ntokenization strategies, embedding techniques, and pre-training mechanisms to enhance molecular \nrepresentation learning, facilitating the optimization of various downstream tasks  (Table 2). For \ninstance, Mol-BERT [45] employs a context -aware tokenizer to encode atoms into chemically \nmeaningful discrete values, although this approach results in an unbalanced atom vocabulary. \nSMILES-BERT [46], a semi -supervised model incorporating an attention -based Transformer \narchitecture, utilizes datasets such as LogP, PM2, and PCBA-686978 to pre-train the model via a \nMasked SMILES Recovery (MSR) task. This model demonstrates strong generalization \ncapabilities, enabling its application to diverse molecular property prediction tasks through fine -\ntuning. Similarly, Mol-GPT [47] facilitates the generation of molecules with specific scaffolds and \ndesired molecular properties by conditioning the generation process on scaffold SMILES strings \nand property values. Notably, SynerGPT  [48] enables a pre -trained GPT model to perform in -\ncontext learning of “drug synergy functions” , showcasing potential for future advancements in \npersonalized drug discovery. These foundation models  developed based on distinct strategies, \neffectively learn representations from raw sequence data and molecular descriptors. They provide \nsignificant insights into the design of small -molecule drugs, drug -drug interactions, and drug -\ntarget interactions. \nSingle-cell foundation models. Foundation models in single-cell analysis are revolutionizing the \nfield by offering scalable and versatile solutions for a wide range of tasks, leveraging both cell and \ngene-level representations (Table 2). Models like scBERT  [20], tGPT [19], scMulan [26], UCE \n[49] and CancerFoundation [50] focus on learning robust cell representations, effectively \nsupporting applications such as cell clustering, cell type annotation, batch effect correction,  \ntrajectory inference and drug response prediction. These models excel at analyzing heterogeneous \ncellular populations and uncovering cellular dynamics. In contrast, models like scGPT [21], \nscFoundation [25], Geneformer [18]  GeneCompass [51] and scPRINT [52] combine the ability to \nlearn both cell and gene-level representations. They capture inter-gene relationships and regulatory \nnetworks, making them highly effective for tasks such as gene expression profiling, gene \nregulatory network (GRN) inference, gene pertur bation prediction, and drug dose -response \nprediction. Notably, scGPT can also handle single -cell multi-omics data, facilitating tasks like \nscRNA-seq and scATAC -seq integration. Another notable model is Nicheform er [53], a  \nfoundation model specifically designed for spatial transcriptomics. It focuses on learning cell \nrepresentations while being highly adaptable to various downstream tasks in spatial \ntranscriptomics, such as spatial label prediction (e.g., cell type, niche, and region labels), niche \ncomposition analysis, and neighborhood density prediction. Additionally, Nicheformer can \ngenerate joint embeddings of scRNA -seq and spatial transcriptomics data, facilitating the \nintegration of these modalities for a more comprehensive understanding of cellular and spatial \ninteractions. \n \n4. Applications of large language models in bioinformatics \nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen numerous successful applications in bioinformatics, \naddressing a wide array of tasks across DNA, RNA, protein, drug discovery, and single -cell \nanalysis (Figure 4 ). These applications highlight the adaptability and potential of LLMs in \novercoming bioinformatic challenges, enabling deeper insights into complex biological systems \nand fostering advancements across multiple domains. \n4.1 Applications of large language models in genomics \nThe DNA language models take DNA sequence as input, use transformer, BERT, GPT models to \nsolve multiple biological tasks, including genome -wide variant effects prediction, DNA cis -\nregulatory regions prediction, DNA-protein interaction prediction, DNA methylation (6mA,4mC \n5hmC) prediction, splice sites prediction from DNA sequence  (Table 3, Supplementary Figure \n1). A detailed list of DNA language models, their downstream tasks, and the datasets used can be \nfound in Supplementary Table 1. \nGenome-wide variant effects prediction. Genome-wide variant effects prediction is crucial for \nunderstanding the role of DNA mutations in species diversity. Genome -wide association studies \n(GWAS) provide valuable insights but often struggle to identify specific causal variants  [30, 54]. \nThe Genome Prediction Network (GPN)  [32]  addresses this by using unsupervised pre -training \non genomic DNA sequences. During this process, GPN predicts nucleotides at masked positions \nwithin a 512 -bp DNA sequence. This model is particularly effective at predicting rare variant \neffects, often mis sed by traditional GWAS methods. Additionally, models like DNABERT, \nDNABERT-2, and the Nucleotide Transformer also predict variant effects from DNA sequences. \nThese advancements highlight ongoing efforts to better understand how DNA mutations contribute \nto biological diversity. \nCis-regulatory regions prediction. Cis-regulatory sequences, such as enhancers and promoters, \nplay crucial roles in gene expression regulation, influencing development and physiology  [55]. \nHowever, identifying these sequences remains a major challenge  [56]. Pre -trained models like \nDNABERT, DNABERT-2, GROVER, and DNAGPT have been developed to predict promoter \nregions and their activities with high accuracy. BERT -Promoter [57] utilizes a pre-trained BERT \nmodel for feature representation and SHAP analysis to filter data, improving prediction \nperformance and generalization over traditional methods. Enhancers, which bind transcription \nfactors to regulate gene expression  [58, 59] , are predicted by iEnhancer -BERT [60], which \nleverages DNABERT and uses a novel transfer learning approach. This model employs output \nfrom all transformer encoder layers and classifies features with a Convolutional Neural Network \n(CNN). These advancements highlight the growing trend of treati ng biological sequences as a \nnatural language for computational modeling, offering new tools for identifying cis -regulatory \nregions and understanding their roles in diseases. \nDNA-protein interaction  prediction. Accurate identification of DNA -protein interactions is \ncrucial for gene expression regulation and understanding evolutionary processes  [61]. Several \nDNA language models, including DNABERT, DNABERT -2, and GROVER, have been \ndeveloped to predict protein-DNA binding from ChIP-seq data. TFBert [62] is a pre-trained model \nspecifically designed for DNA-protein binding prediction, which treats DNA sequences as natural \nsentences and k -mer nucleotides as words, allowing effective context extraction. Pre -trained on \n690 ChIP -seq datasets, TFBert delivers s trong performance with minimal fine -tuning. The \nMoDNA [63] framework introduces domain knowledge by incorporating common DNA \nfunctional motifs. During self-supervised pre-training, MoDNA performs tasks such as k-mer and \nmotif prediction. Pre -training on extensive unlabeled genome data, MoDNA acquires semantic -\nlevel genome representations, enhancing predictions for promoter regions and transcription factor \nbinding sites. Essentially, MoDNA functions as a biological language model for DNA -protein \nbinding prediction. \nDNA methylation  prediction. DNA methylation is a key biological process in epigenetic \nregulation and is linked to various medical conditions and applications, such as metagenomic \nbinning [64]. DNA methylation types depend on the nucleotide where the methyl group attaches  \n[65]. Several models predict DNA methylation with varying accuracy. BERT6mA [66] is designed \nfor predicting 6-methyadenine (6mA) sites, while iDNA-ABT [67], iDNA-ABF [68], and MuLan-\nMethyl [69] are versatile models predicting various methylation types (6mA, 5hmC, 4mC). iDNA-\nABT, a deep learning model, integrates BERT with transductive information maximization (TIM), \nthough it has yet to fully explore feature representation. iDNA-ABF uses a multi-scale architecture, \napplying multiple tokenizers for diverse embeddings, and MuLan -Methyl employs four \ntransformer-based models (DistilBERT [70], ALBERT[71], XLNet [72], and ELECTRA [73]) to \npredict methylation sites, enhancing performance through joint model utilization. \nDNA level splice site identification. Accurate pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper protein \ntranslation, driven by splice site selection. Identifying splice sites is challenging, particularly with \nprevalent GT-AG sequences [74]. To address this, DNABERT and DNABERT-2 were developed, \ntrained on 10,000 donor s, acceptor, and non -splice site sequences from the human reference \ngenome to predict splice sites. DNABERT showed high attention to intronic regions, suggesting \nthe functional role of intronic splicing enhancers and silencers as cis -regulatory elements in \nsplicing regulation. This highlights DNABERT’s potential in understanding splicing mechanisms. \n4.2 Applications of large language models in transcriptomics \nThe RNA language models take RNA sequences as input, use transformer, BERT, GPT models to \nsolve multiple biological tasks, including RNA 2D/3D structure prediction, RNA structural \nalignment,, RNA family clustering, RNA splice sites prediction from RNA sequence, RNA N7 -\nmethylguanosine modification prediction, RNA 2 ’-O-methylation modifications prediction, \nmultiple types of RNA modifications prediction, predicting the association between miRNA, \nlncRNA and disease, identifying lncRNAs, lncRNAs’ coding potential prediction, protein \nexpression and mRNA degradation prediction (Table 3, Supplementary Figure 1). A detailed list \nof RNA language models, their downstream tasks, and the datasets used can be found in \nSupplementary Table 1. \nSecondary structure prediction. RNA secondary structure prediction is a major challenge for \nRNA structural biologists, with models holding potential for RNA -targeting drug development  \n[75]. Several RNA language models, such as RNABERT [8], RNA-MSM [5], RNA-FM [4], and \nUNI-RNA [35], have been devel oped to predict RNA structures with varying sophistication. \nRNABERT uses BERT architecture to predict structural features like base-pairing and stem loops. \nRNA-MSM integrates sequence and structural information to predict local and long-range folding \npatterns. RNA-FM focuses on RNA folding, stability, and energetics, including pseudoknots. UNI-\nRNA combines sequence and structure predictions across various RNA types. These models \nadvance RNA structure prediction by applying deep learning and advanced techniques to improve \nunderstanding of RNA folding and function. \nRNA splicing prediction . RNA splicing is crucial for gene expression in eukaryotes, and \nadvancements have been made in sequence -based splicing modeling through models like \nSpliceBERT [36] and UNI-RNA [35]. SpliceBERT, based on BERT, is trained to predict RNA \nsplicing events by capturing lon g-range dependencies, identifying splice sites, and predicting \nalternative splicing events. UNI-RNA, a more generalized model, integrates multiple RNA tasks, \nincluding splicing, and combines sequence and structural data to predict splicing regulatory \nelements and interactions with splicing factors. These models enhance the understanding of RNA \nsplicing, gene regulation, and its role in diseases, providing powerful tools f or studying splicing \ndefects and mutations. \nlncRNAs identification and lncRNAs’ coding potential  prediction. Long non-coding RNAs \n(lncRNAs) play significant regulatory roles in cancer and diseases, and their small Open Reading \nFrames (sORFs), once thought weak in protein translation, are now known to encode peptides [76]. \nIdentifying lncRNAs with sORFs is crucial for discovering new regulatory factors. LncCat  [77] \naddresses this challenge by using category boosting and ORF-attention features, including BERT \nfor peptide sequence representation, to improve prediction accuracy for both long ORF and sORF \ndatasets. It demonstrates effectiveness across multiple species and Ribo-seq datasets in identifying \nlncRNAs with sORFs.  In predicting translatable sORFs in lncRNAs (lncRNA -sORFs), LSCPP-\nBERT [78]  is a novel method designed for plants, leveraging pre -trained transformer models for \nreliable coding potential prediction. LSCPP -BERT is poised to impact drug development and \nagriculture by enhancing understanding of lncRNA coding potential. \nRNA–RBP interactions prediction. RNA sequences differ from DNA sequences by a single base \n(thymine to uracil), maintaining largely congruent syntax and semantics. BERT ’s versatility \nextends to Cross -linking and Immunoprecipitation  data, particularly in predicting RNA -binding \nprotein (RBP) binding preferences. BERT-RBP [79]  is a model pre-trained on a human reference \ngenome, designed to forecast RNA-RBP interactions. It outperforms existing models when tested \non eCLIP -seq data from 154 RBPs and can identify transcript regions and RNA secondary \nstructures based on sequence a lone. BERT-RBP demonstrates BERT’s adaptability in biological \ncontexts and its potential to advance RNA-protein interaction understanding. \nRNA-RNA interaction prediction. RNA–RNA interactions occur between various RNA species, \nincluding long non-coding RNAs, mRNAs, and small RNAs (e.g., miRNAs and lncRNAs), driven \nby complementary sequences, secondary structures, and other motifs [80]. Accurate prediction of \nthese interactions provides insights into RNA -mediated regulation, enhancing understanding of \nbiological processes like gene expression, splicing, and translation.  RNAErnie, used for this \npurpose, employs a TBTH architecture combining RNAErnie with a hybrid network (CNN, Bi -\nLSTM, and MLP) to predict RNA –RNA interactions. This approach demonstrates RNAErnie's \npotential in advancing RNA-based regulatory network studies. \nRNA modification prediction. Post-transcriptional RNA modifications, such as N7 -\nmethylguanosine (m7G) and 2’ -O-methylation (Nm), regulate gene expression and are linked to \ndiseases [76, 81]. Identifying modification sites is essential but challenging due to the high cost \nand time required by experimental methods. Computational tools like BERT -m7G [82] and \nBert2Ome [83] address this issue. BERT-m7G uses a stacking ensemble approach to identify m7G \nsites directly from RNA sequences, offering an efficient, cost -effective alternative. Bert2Om \ncombines BERT and CNN to predict 2’ -O-methylation sites, outperforming existing me thods \nacross datasets and species. These tools enhance the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of RNA \nmodification site identification, advancing research into RNA modifications and their roles in gene \nregulation and disease. \nProtein expression and mRNA degradation prediction. mRNA vaccines are a cost -effective, \nrapid, and safe alternative to traditional vaccines, showing high potency [84]. These vaccines work \nby introducing mRNA that encodes a viral protein. CodonBERT  [85] is a model specifically \ndesigned for mRNA sequences to predict protein expression. It uses a multi -head attention \ntransformer architecture and was pre -trained on 10 million mRNA sequences from various \norganisms. This pre -training enables CodonBERT to excel  in tasks like protein expression and \nmRNA degradation prediction. Its ability to integrate new biological information makes it a \nvaluable tool for mRNA vaccine development. CodonBERT surpasses existing methods, \noptimizing mRNA vaccine design and improvin g efficacy and applicability in immunization. Its \nstrength in predicting protein expression enhances mRNA vaccine development efficiency and \neffectiveness. \n5’ UTR-based mean ribosome loading prediction and mRNA subcellular localization \nprediction. The 5’ UTR sequence plays a critical role in regulating translation efficiency. RNA \nsequence models like 3UTRBERT, UNI-RNA, UTR-LM, RNA-FM, and Nucleotide Transformer \nhave been developed to predict key features of the 5 ’ UTR, focusing on ribosome loading \nefficiency and mRNA localization. These models use Tran sformer-based architecture to analyze \nsequence patterns, motifs, and structural elements. For example, 3UTRBERT  [37] and RNA-FM \n[4] predict ribosome loading efficiency, identifying regions likely to recruit ribosomes for \ntranslation initiation. UTR -LM [38], UNI-RNA [35], and Nucleotide Transformer  [31] predict \nmRNA subcellular localization, determining where mRNA will localize in the cell (cyto plasm, \nribosomes, or nucleus), which is crucial for regulating mRNA stability and translation. Together, \nthese models provide valuable insights into gene expression, translation control, and RNA \nlocalization, advancing molecular biology research. \n4.3 Applications of large language models in proteomics \nProtein is an indispensable molecule in life, assuming a pivotal role in the construction and \nsustenance of vital processes. As the field of protein research advances, there has been a substantial \nsurge in the accumulation of protein data [86]. In this context, the utilization of large language \nmodels emerges as a viable approach to extract pertinent and valuable information from these vast \nreservoirs of data. Several pre -trained protein language models (PPLMs) have been proposed to \nlearn the c haracteristic representations of proteins data (e.g., protein sequences, gene ontology \nannotations, property descriptions), then applied to different tasks by fine -tuning, adding or \naltering downstream networks, such as protein structure, post-translational modifications (PTMs), \nand biophysical properties, which align with corresponding downstream tasks like secondary \nstructure prediction, major PTMs prediction, and stability prediction [87, 88].  \nEven though antibodies are classified as proteins, the datasets of antibodies and subsequent tasks \ndiffer significantly from those of proteins. Through the establishment and continuous updates of \nthe Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database [89], a substantial amount of antibody sequence \ndata has become available, which can be utilized to facilitate the development of pre -trained \nantibody large language models (PALMs). PALMs primarily delve into downstream topics \nencompassing therapeutic antibody  binding mechanisms, immune evolution, and antibody \ndiscovery, which correspond to tasks like paratope prediction, B cell maturation analysis, and \nantibody sequence classification (Table 3, Supplementary Figure 2).  \nIn this section, some of the popular protein -related large language models of recent years are \nintroduced, as well as corresponding important downstream tasks. It is important to emphasize that \nboth PPLM and PALM are capable of handling not only the downstream tasks introduced in this \nsection. For further details, additional information can be referenced within Supplementary Table \n2. \nSecondary structure and contact prediction . Protein structure is critical to its function and \ninteractions [90]. However, traditional experimental techniques for protein structure analysis are \ntime-consuming and labor-intensive. With the rise of deep learning, large language models have \ndemonstrated significant advantages in computational efficiency and prediction accuracy for \nprotein structure prediction [91]. MSA Transformer [92] introduces a protein language model that \nprocesses MSAs using a unique mechanism of interleaved row and column attention. Trained with \na MLM objective across diverse protein families, it outperformed earlier unsupervised approaches \nand showed greater parameter efficiency than previous models. Drawing on insights from BERT, \nlarge parameter models tend to achieve better performance for predicting secondary structures and \ncontacts.  Few models have more parameters than the largest models in ProtTrans [11], which \nincludes a series of  autoregressive models (Transformer-XL [93], XLNet [72]) and four encoder \n(BERT [2], Albert [71], Electra [73], T5 [94]) trained on datasets like UniRef [95] and BFD [96], \ncomprising up to 393 billion amino acids. Model sizes vary from millions to billions of parameters. \nNotably, ProtTrans made a significant breakthrough in per-residue predictions. \nProtein sequence generation. Protein sequence generation holds significant potential in drug \ndesign and protein engineering  [97]. Using machine learning or deep learning, generated \nsequences aim for good foldability, stable 3D structures, and specific functional properties, such \nas enzyme activity and antibody binding. The development of large language models, combined \nwith conditional models, has greatly advanced protein generation [98]. ProGen [12] incorporates \nUniprotKB keywords as conditional tags, covering over 1,100 categories like 'biological process' \nand 'molecular function'. Proteins generated by ProGen, assessed for sequence similarity, \nsecondary structure, and conformational energy, exhibit desirable structural properties.  In 2022, \nProtGPT2 [41] inspired by GPT-x was developed. ProtGPT2-generated proteins show amino acid \npropensities like natural proteins. Prediction of disorder and secondary structure reveals that 88% \nof these proteins are globular, resembling natural sequences.  Employing AlphaFold [99, 100] on \nProtGPT2 sequences produces well-folded, non-idealized structures with unique topologies not \nseen in current databases, suggesting ProtGPT2 has effectively learned “protein language”. \nProtein function prediction . Proteins are essential in cellular metabolism, signal transduction, \nand structural support, making their function critical for drug development and disease analysis. \nHowever, predicting and annotating protein functions is challenging due to their complexit y. \nPPLMs offer effective solutions to these challenges  [101, 102] . ProtST [103] introduced a \nmultimodal framework combining a PPLM for sequences and a biomedical language model (BLM) \nfor protein property descriptions. Through three pre -training tasks , unimodal mask prediction, \nmultimodal representation alignment, and multimodal mask prediction , the model excels in tasks \nlike protein function annotation, zero -shot classification, and functional protein retrieval from \nlarge databases.  While most methods focus on increasing model parameters to improve \nperformance, CaLM [14] introduces an alternative representation, the cDNA sequence, akin to an \namino acid sequence, as input. The core idea lies in the relationship between synonymous codon \nusage and protein structure  [104], and the information encoded in codons is no less than that of \namino acids. Experimental results demonstrate that even with a small parameter language model, \nusing cDNA sequences as input enhances performance in tasks such as protein function prediction, \nspecies recognition, prediction of protein and transcript abundance, and melting point estimation. \nMajor post-translational modification prediction.  Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are \nchemical changes, such as phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation, that alter protein \nstructure and function after translation. PTMs influence protein stability, localization, interactions, \nand function, making their study crucial for disease diagnosis and therapeutic strategies [105, 106]. \nLanguage models can effectively predict PTMs and related tasks like signal peptide prediction. \nProteinBERT [42] , with only ~16M parameters, is not large enough but performs well due to its \ninclusion of Gene Ontology (GO) annotation tasks. By incorporating GO interactions with protein \nsequences, ProteinBERT achieves strong performance on PTM prediction and other pr otein \nproperty benchmarks, outperforming models with larger parameter sizes. \nEvolution and mutation prediction . Protein evolution and mutation drive functional diversity, \naiding adaptation to environmental changes and offering insights into protein function origin, \nwhich can inform drug development and disease treatment [107, 108]. UniRep [109], built on the \nLSTM architecture, was trained on the UniRef50 [95] and excelled in tasks like remote homology \ndetection and mutation effect prediction. ESM-1b [40] , a deep transformer model trained on 250 \nmillion sequences, with 33 layers and 650 million parameters, captures essential protein sequence \npatterns through self-supervised learning. ESM-1b is also integral to frameworks like PLMSearch \n[110] and DHR  [111] , which enable fast, sensitive homology searches. PLMSearch uses \nsupervised training, while DHR relies on unsupervised contrastive learning and enhances structure \nprediction models like AlphaFold2 [100]. \nBiophysical properties prediction. Biophysical properties of proteins, such as fluorescence and \nstability landscapes [112], are crucial for understanding protein folding, stability, and \nconformational changes, with significant implications for drug design, protein engineering, and \nenzyme engineering. Deep learning advancements have enabled more accurate prediction of these \nproperties using PPLMs.  TAPE benchmark [39] established standardized tasks for evaluating \nprotein, including fluorescence and stability landscape prediction. In 2022, PromptProtein [113],  \na prompt-based pre-trained model, incorporated multi-task pre-training and a fine-tuning module \nto improve task -specific performance. It outperformed existing methods in function and \nbiophysical properties prediction, demonstrating substantial gains in predictive accuracy.  \nProtein-protein interaction and binding affinity prediction. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) \nare crucial for biological functions, and their prediction is also vital for drug discovery and design. \nPPLMs provide efficient, accurate predictions of PPI types and binding affinities [114, 115]. KeAP \nmodel [43], like ProtST, aims to integrate fine -grained information beyond OntoProtein [116]. \nKeAP uses a triplet format (Protein, Relation, Attribute) as input, processed by encoders and a \ncascaded decoder based on the Transformer architecture. Using MLM for pre -training, KeAP \nemploys a cross -attention fusion mechanism to capture detailed protei n information, achieving \nsuperior performance on tasks such as PPI identification and binding affinity estimation. \nAntigen-receptor binding and antigen -antibody binding prediction . Antigen proteins are \nprocessed into neoantigen peptides that bind to the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), \nforming pMHC complexes. These complexes are presented to T -cells, stimulating antibody \nproduction by B-cells, which triggers an immune response  [117] . Predicting peptide binding to \nMHC molecules is a key focus of language models in this process [118, 119]. MHCRoBERTa \n[120] uses a pretrained BERT model to predict pMHC -I binding by learning the biological \nmeaning of amino acid sequences. BERTMHC [121], trained on 2,413 MHC –peptide pairs, \nfocuses on pMHC-II binding prediction, filling a gap in this area.  \nAnother goal is predicting the binding specificity of adaptive immune receptors (AIRs), \nparticularly TCRs. TCR-BERT [122] learns TCR CDR3 sequences to predict antigen specificity \nbut lacks the ability to model the interaction between TCR chains. SC-AIR-BERT [123] addresses \nthis by pre -training a model that outperforms others in TCR and BCR binding specificity.  \nAdditionally, the Antiformer  [124] integrates RNA -seq and BCT -seq data in a graph -based \nframework to improve antibody development. In antibody modeling, three recent models focus on \nunique tasks. AbLang [125], built on RoBERTa [126], excels at restoring lost residues during \nsequencing and outperforms other models in accuracy and efficiency. AntiBERTa [127] \nunderstands antibody \"language\" through tasks like predicting immunogenicity and binding sites. \nEATLM [128] , with its unique pre -training tasks (Ancestor Germline Prediction and Mutation \nPosition Prediction), contributes a reliable benchmark for antibody language models. \n4.4 Applications of large language models in drug discovery \nDrug discovery is an expensive and long-term process that exhibits a low success rate. During the \nearly stages of drug discovery, computer -aided drug discovery, employing empirical or expert \nknowledge algorithms, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning algorithms, serve to \naccelerate the generation and screening of drug molecules and their lead compounds [129-131]. It \nspeeds up the entire drug discovery process, especially the development of small molecule drugs. \nAmong commonly used medications, small molecule drugs can account for up to 98% of the total \n[132]. The structure of small molecule drugs exhibits excellent spatial dispersibility, and their \nchemical properties determine their good drug -like properties and pharmacokinetic properties \n[133]. With the development of deep learning and the proposal of large language models, it has \nbecome easy to apply these methods to discover hidden patterns of molecules and interactions \nbetween molecules for drugs (such as small molecules) and targets (such as proteins and RNA) \nthat can be easily represented as sequence data. The Simplified Molecular -Input Line -Entry \nSystem (SMILES) string and chemical fingerprint are commonly used to represent molecules.  \nAdditionally, through the pooling process of graph neural networks(GNN), small molecules can \nbe transformed into sequential representations [134]. With the protein sequence, large language \nmodels can engage in drug discovery through various inputs. Within this section, key tasks within \nthe early drug discovery process that have effectively leveraged larg e language models will be \nintroduced (Table 3, Supplementary Figure 3). A detailed list of drug discovery language models, \ntheir downstream tasks, and the datasets used can be found in Supplementary Table 3. \nDrug-like molecular properties prediction . In drug discovery, significant focus is placed on \nproperties like ADMET and PK to develop more effective, accessible, and safe drugs [135, 136]. \nLarge language models (LLMs) are used for molecular property prediction, including these \nproperties. Since molecular SMILES representations are consistent, models can be easily improved \nand fine-tuned for specific tasks based on researchers' requirements. SMILES-BERT [17] departed \nfrom the usage of knowledge -based molecular fingerprints as input. Instead, it adopted a \nrepresentation method where molecules were encoded as SMILES sequences and employed as \ninput for both pre -training and fine -tuning within a BERT -based model.  This novel approach \nyielded superior outcomes across various downstream molecular property prediction tasks, \nsurpassing the performance o f previous models reliant on molecular fingerprints. ChemBERTa \n[137] is a BERT-based model that focuses on the scalability of large language models, exploring \nthe impact of pre -training dataset size, tokenizer, and string representation.  Subsequently, \nChemBERTa-2[138] improved upon ChemBERTa by using a larger dataset of 77 million \ncompounds from PubChem, enhancing its ability to learn from diverse chemical structures. It also \nintegrates advanced self -supervised learning techniques and fine -tuning strategies, resulting in \nbetter generalization performance across various downstream tasks . K-BERT [15] stands out by \nusing three pre -training tasks: atom feature prediction, molecular feature prediction, and \ncontrastive learning. This approach enables the model to understand the essence of SMILES \nrepresentations, resulting in exceptional performance across 15 drug datasets, highlighting its \neffectiveness in drug discovery. Giv en the importance of graph neural networks in the \ndevelopment of molecular pre-training models, Mole-BERT [139] introduces atom-level Masked \nAtoms Modeling (MAM) task and graph-level Triplet Masked Contrastive Learning (TMCL) task. \nThese tasks enable the network to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the “language” \nembedded within molecular graphs. By adopting this approach, the network demonstrates \nexceptional performance across eight downstream tasks, showcasing its adaptability and \neffectiveness in diverse applications. \nDrug-like molecules generation. It is very difficult to chase the full coverage of the enormous \ndrug-like chemical space (estimated at mo re than 10 63 compounds), and traditional virtual \nscreening libraries usually contain less than 10 7 compounds and are sometimes not available. In \nsuch circumstances, the utilization of deep learning methods to generate molecules exhibiting \ndrug-like properties emerges as a viable approach [140, 141] . Inspired by the generative pre -\ntraining model GPT, MolGPT [16] model was introduced. In addition to performing the next token \nprediction task, MolGPT incorporates an extra training task for conditional prediction, facilitating \nthe capability of conditional generation. Beyond its capacity to generate innovative and efficacious \nmolecules, the model has demonstrated an enhanced ability to capture the statistical characteristics \nwithin the dataset. \nDrug-target interaction predictions . The investigation of Drug -Target Interaction (DTI) holds \nparamount significance in the realm of drug development and the optimization of drug therapy. \nUnderstanding drug -target interactions aids in pharmaceutical design, accelerates drug \ndevelopment, and reduces time and resource costs in lab experimentation and trial -and-error \nmethods [142, 143]. During the exploration of DTI, diligent focus is placed on the prediction of \ndrug-target binding affinity. DTI-BERT employs a fine-tuned ProtBERT [144] model to process \nprotein sequences and applies discrete wavelet transform to drug molecular fingerprints. . \nTransDTI [145] is a multi-class classification and regression workflow. This model not only uses \nfine-tuned SMILES-BERT to extract drug features, but also expands the selection of fine -tuned \nlarge protein models. After acquiring potential representations of drug -target pairs, the authors \nsubject the representations to downstrea m neural networks for the completion of a multi -\nclassification task. Additionally, The Chemical-Chemical Protein-Protein Transferred DTA (C2P2) \n[146] method uses pre -trained protein and molecular large language models to capture the \ninteraction information within molecules. Given the relatively limited scale of the DTI dataset, \nC2P2 leverages protein-protein interaction (PPI) and chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) tasks to \nacquire knowledge of intermolecular interactions and subsequently transfer this knowledge to \naffinity prediction tasks [147]. It is worth highlighting that in scenarios involving the docking or \nwhen emphasizing the spatial structure of a complex, methodologies incorporating 3D convolution \nnetworks, point clouds -based networks, and graph networks are often employed [148-151]. In \nsituations where the molecular structure is unknown, but the sequence is available, the prediction \nof DTI using large-scale models still holds significant promise. \nDrug synergistic effects predictions. Combination therapy is common for complex diseases like \ncancer, infections, and neurological disorders, often surpassing single-drug treatments. Predicting \ndrug pair synergy, where combining drugs boosts therapeutic effects, is vital in drug development. \nHowever, it’s challenging due to many drug combinations and complex biology [152, 153] . \nVarious computational methods, including machine learning, help predict drug pair synergy. Carl \nEdwards et al. introduced SynerGPT [48], which is based on GPT trained to in-context learn drug \nsynergy functions without relying on domain -specific knowledge.  Wei Zhang et al. [154] \nintroduced DCE -DForest [154], a m odel for predicting drug combination synergies. It uses a \npretrained drug BERT model to encode the drug SMILES and then predicts synergistic effects \nbased on the embedding vectors of drugs and cell lines using the deep forest method. Mengdie \nXua et al. [155] utilized a fine-tuned pre-trained large language model and a dual feature fusion \nmechanism to predict synergistic drug combinations. Its input includes hashed atom pair molecular \nfingerprints of drugs, SMILES string encodings, and cell line gene expressio ns. They conducted \nablation analyses on the dual feature fusion network for drug-drug synergy prediction, highlighting \nthe significant role of fingerprint inputs in ensuring high-quality drug synergy predictions. \n4.5 Applications of large language models in single-cell analysis \nLarge language models have demonstrated significant applications in single -cell analysis, \nincluding cell-level tasks such as identifying cell types, determining cell states, and discovering \nnovel cell populations; gene-level tasks like inferring gene regul atory networks; and multi-omics \ntasks, such as integrating single -cell multi-omics (scMulti-omics) data (Supplementary Figure \n4). Additionally, this section will explore emerging language models based on spatial \ntranscriptomics (Table 3). A detailed list of single -cell large language models, their downstream \ntasks, and the datasets used can be found in Supplementary Table 4. \nCell-level tasks . Cell-level tasks, such as cell clustering, cell type annotation, novel cell type \ndiscovery, batch effect removal and trajectory inference, are critical in single-cell analysis. These \ntasks often rely on cell representations learned during pretraining, which are subsequently fine -\ntuned for different tasks. Single -cell language models derive cell representations in two primary \nways. The first method utilizes a special class token (<cls>) appended to the i nput sequence; its \nembedding is updated through the transformer layers, and the final embedding at the <cls> position \nserves as the cell representation. The second method generates a cell embedding matrix from the \nmodel output, where each row represents a specific cell. Both approaches facilitate downstream \ntasks, as demonstrated by TOSICA  [22], which uses the <cls> token to predict cell type \nprobabilities using the whole conjunction neural network cell type classifier to annotate single \ncells, and iSEEK [156], which generates cell embedding for cell clustering, cell type annotation, \nand developmental trajectory exploration. Models like scBERT [20] and UCE [49] leverage multi-\nhead attention mechanisms to extract information from diverse representation subspaces, \ndiscerning subtle differences between novel and known cell types. Their large receptive fields \ncapture long -range gene -gene interactions, enabling compr ehensive characterization of novel \ncellular states. Addressing batch effects, which arise from variations in species, tissues, operators, \nand experimental protocols, remains a significant challenge in single-cell analysis. Large language \nmodels, pretrained on extensive datasets, utilize attention mechanisms to incorporate prior \nbiological knowledge, enabling batch -insensitive data annotation. Without relying on explicit \nbatch information, models such as CIForm [152] have dem onstrated effectiveness in both intra -\ndataset and inter-dataset scenarios. They handle annotations across diverse species, organs, tissues, \nand technologies while also supporting the integration of reference and query data from various \nsequencing platforms or studies. This capability allows them to address batch effects in single-cell \nanalysis. Drug response or sensitivity prediction is a classification task akin to cell type annotation, \nwhere a classifier is appended to the learned cell embeddings to predict whether a cell will respond \nto or exhibit sensitivity to a specific drug. Models like sc Foundation [25] and CellLM  [157] \neffectively utilize this approach, leveraging the robust cell representations learned during \npretraining to enhance prediction accuracy. \nGene-level tasks. Gene-level tasks, such as gene expression prediction, gene regulatory network \n(GRN) inference, gene perturbation prediction, and drug dose-response prediction, are integral to \nunderstanding single -cell transcriptomics.  Self-attention mechanisms have transformed deep \nlearning by enabling context-aware models that prioritize relevant elements in large input spaces. \nThese models, particularly transformers, are well -suited for modeling the context -dependent \ndynamics of gene regulatory networks. By focusing on key interactions, transformers can \neffectively capture the complexities of regulatory relationships, such as  the attention matrix in \nGeneformer [18] and scGPT [21] reflect which genes that gene pays attention to and which genes \npay attention to that gene, aiding to infer gene regulation network. Geneformer is pretrained on a \nvast repository of single -cell transcriptomes to learn gene relationships for diverse downstream \napplications, including predicting dosage-sensitive disease genes, identifying downstream targets, \nforecasting chromatin dynamics, and modeling network dynamics. In addition, after pretraining \nand fine -tuning, single -cell language m odels output gene e mbeddings that can be utilized for \nfunctional analysis of scRNA-seq data. For instance, scGPT [21] serves as a generalizable feature \nextractor leveraging zero -shot learning, enabling applications in gene expression prediction and \ngenetic perturbation prediction. Similarly, in scFoundation [25], zero-expressed genes and masked \ngenes are combined with the output from the transformer -based encoder. This combined \ninformation is then input into the decoder and projected to gene expression values through a \nmultilayer perceptron (MLP). The gene context expression is employed to formulate a cell-specific \ngene graph, facilitating the prediction of perturbations using the GEARS [158] model. It is worth \nnoting that genes have a lot of prior knowledge that can be used to enhance many gene-level tasks. \nFor example, GeneCompass [51] incorporates four types of biological prior knowledge, including \nGRN, promoter information, gene family annotation and gene -co-expressed relationship, making \nit capable for various gene tasks.  \nscMulti-omics tasks. Studying single -cell multi -omics data requires integrating diverse \ninformation from genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics at the single-cell level. \nThe adaptability, generalization capabilities, and feature extraction strengths of large language \nmodels make them effective in addressing challenges such as feature variance, data sparsity, and \ncell heterogeneity inherent in single -cell multi-omics datasets. scMulti-omics integration can be \nviewed as a specialized form of batch effect removal. For example, scGPT  [21] treats each \nmodality as a distinct batch and incorporates a special modality token to represent input features \n(such as genes, regions, or proteins) associated with each modality. This approach helps the \ntransformer model balance attention across modalities, preventing overemphasis on intra-modality \nfeatures while integrating inter -modality relationships effectively. Another approach involves \nprocessing different modalities through separate transformers before projecting their embeddings \ninto a common late nt space. Models like scMVP  [159] use mask attention -based encoders for \nscRNA-seq data and transformer -based multi-head self-attention encoders for scATAC -seq. By \naligning variations between different omics in this latent space, scMVP captures joint profiling of \nscRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, achieving paired integration where gene expression and chromatin \naccessibility are studied within the same cells.  Graphs are increasingly recognized as powerful \ntools for characterizing feature heterogeneity in scMulti -omics integration. For example, \nDeepMAPS [160] leverages graph transformers to construct cell and gene graphs, learning both \nlocal and global features that build cell -cell and gene -gene relationships for data integration, \ninference of biological networks from scMulti-omics data and cell-cell communication.  \nRecent advances in sequencing technologies that capture multiple modalities within the same cell \nhave enabled the development of computational tools for cross-modality prediction. One approach \ninvolves training large language models on paired datasets to p redict one modality from another. \nFor instance, scTranslator [161], pre-trained on paired bulk and single-cell data, fine-tunes to infer \nprotein abundance from scRNA -seq data by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between \npredicted and actual protein levels. Another strategy leverages graph learning with prior \nknowledge to model feature relationships. For example, scMoFormer [162] can not only translate \ngene expression to protein abundance, but is also applicable to multi-omics predictions, including \nprotein abundance to gene expression, chromatin accessibility to gene expression, gene expression \nto chromatin accessibility using graph transformers. Taking protein prediction task as an example, \nscMoFormer constructs cell-gene graph, gene-gene graph, protein-protein graph, and gene-protein \ngraph based on gene expression profiles and prior knowledge from STRING database [163]. Each \nmodality has a separate transformer to learn the global information that may not be included in \nprior knowledge. Message -passing graph neural networks (GNNs) link nodes across various \ngraphs, while transformers are employed to precisely map gene expression to protein abundance. \nSpatial transcriptomics tasks. The rapid development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics \nhas advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and tissue architecture. Spatial \ntranscriptomics retains cells ’ native spatial context, enabling insights into cellular interactions. \nLarge language models address the challenge of high -dimensional spatial data analysis by \nintegrating spatial and molecular information, enhancing tissue-specific pattern interpretation. For \nexample, Nicheformer [53] is the latest large language model in spatial transcriptomics. It \nintegrates extensive spatial transcriptomics and single -cell transcriptomics data, leveraging \nmetadata across multiple modalities, species, and sequencing technologies. By doing so, \nNicheformer is capable of learning joint information from single -cell and spatial transcriptomics, \nenabling the resolution of various spatial prediction tasks even with limited data. Spaformer [164] \nis another transformer-based model designed for spatial transcriptomics data. Spaformer is \ndesigned to address two key challenges: how to encode spatial information of cells into a \ntransformer model and how to train a transformer to overcome the sparsity of spatial \ntranscriptomics data, enabling data imputation. Spatial transcriptomics, as one of the most popular \ntechnologies in recent years, focuses on integrating single -cell resolution gene expression data \nwith tissue spatial information to reveal spatial relationships and functional characteristics among \ncells. However, large language models (LLMs) specifically designed for spatial transcriptomics \nare still in their early stages of development. The creation of these models faces unique challenges, \nsuch a s effectively integrating high -dimensional gene expression data with complex spatial \ninformation and addressing the sparsity and irregularity of the data. \nIn addition to the single -cell large language models discussed  above, another category of single -\ncell prediction models leverages natural language , utilizing textual data such as human -readable \ndescriptions of gene functions and biological features to support various single -cell analyses. For \nexample, GPT-4 [165] leverages its strong contextual understanding for interpreting high -\ndimensional single-cell analysis for accurate cell type annotation. GenePT [166] utilizes OpenAI’s \nChatGPT text embedding to classify gene properties and cell types effectively . More and more  \nmodels demonstrate that natural language pretraining can significantly boost performance on \nsingle-cell downstream tasks, including cell generation [167], cell identity (e.g., cell type, pathway, \nand disease information)  [167-171], and gene enrichment analysis   [169]. These models \ndemonstrate significant potential in advancing single-cell analysis by integrating natural language \nprocessing techniques. However, the reliance on textual data  may constrain performance in less -\nannotated or novel datasets. \n5. Conclusion and Suggestions on large language models in bioinformatics \n5.1 Summary of large language models in bioinformatics \nLarge language models (LLMs) have catalyzed transformative progress across biological \ndisciplines, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery, and single -cell \nanalysis. These models, trained on vast datasets, address challenges like th e sparsity, high \ndimensionality, and heterogeneity of biological data while capturing the complexity of sequence \nrelationships. Tokenization methods are pivotal, converting sequences into manageable formats , \nsuch as, for genomics and transcriptomics, k -mer encoding is prevalent, segmenting DNA/RNA \nsequences into overlapping units. In proteomics, amino acid residue -based tokenization captures \nprotein structure and function. These preprocessing strategies enable LLMs to interpret biological \nlanguage effectively. \nRepresentation learning allows LLMs to uncover contextual and hierarchical relationships within \nbiological data, forming the basis for various downstream applications. These tasks can be grouped \ninto four primary categories: 1)  Classification/Prediction Tasks: Examples include identifying \nfunctional genomic elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers), predicting protein structures and \ninteractions, and cell type  annotation in single-cell data. 2) Generation Tasks: LLMs can create \nbiologically relevant sequences, such as gene expression imputation and synthetic DNA, RNA, or \nprotein sequences, aiding in vaccine development or enzyme engineering. 3) Interaction Tasks: \nThese involve modeling interactions like drug-target binding, cell-cell interaction, protein-protein \ninteractions, or cross-omics relationships (e.g., gene expression to protein abundance). 4) Transfer \nLearning Tasks: Pretrained LLMs, such as DNABERT and scGPT, are fine -tuned for specific \napplications, including single -cell data annotation or predicting RNA modifications like N6 -\nmethyladenosine sites. Despite their capabilities, challenges persist. Biological data often exhibit \nsparsity, as seen in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and irregularity due to sequencing errors \nor noise. To address this , LLMs must effectively integrate multi -modal data, balance \ncomputational efficiency, and ensure interpretability of their outputs. As foundational models \nevolve, their ability to unify diverse biological datasets into a single framework for prediction, \ngeneration, interaction, and transfer learning tasks will continue to reshape our understanding and \napplications of biological systems. \n5.2 Guidance on how to use and develop LLMs in practice \nLarge Language Models offer immense potential in bioinformatics and other fields, but their \neffective utilization and development require distinct approaches for end -users and developers  \n(Figure 5). \nFor LLM users, the process begins by clearly defining the research domain and task, specifying \nthe relevant omics level (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) and identifying whether the \nobjective involves classification or prediction, generation, interaction, or transfer learning. A well-\ndefined objective streamlines the selection of appropriate models and workflows. Next, users \nshould choose models pretrained on data relevant to their domain, as de tailed in Table 2, which \nincludes information on foundation models, their training data types, and availability. For instance, \nDNABERT is ideal for genomics tasks, while scGPT is tailored for single -cell analysis. \nAdditionally, users must assess computational requirements and ensure compatibility with thei r \ndataset size and complexity. Proper data preparation is critical, including aligning data with model \nrequirements, addressing missing values, and incorporating metadata like cell types or genomic \nregions. Table 1  provides common tokenization methods for reference. To leverage transfer \nlearning, users can fine -tune foundation models listed in Table 2  for their specific dataset, \noptimizing performance through hyperparameter tuning, early stopping, and cross -validation. \nAlternatively, users can utilize predeveloped models listed in Supplementary Tables 1 –4 for \nsimilar tasks to obtain results directly. Finally, rigorous evaluation using metrics l ike accuracy, \nprecision, and recall is essential, complemented by interpretation tools such as attention maps or \nfeature embeddings to extract meaningful biological insights (Figure 5). \nFor LLM developers, it is essential to first understand domain-specific challenges to address issues \nlike sparsity, heterogeneity, and high dimensionality. For example, single -cell and spatial \ntranscriptomics datasets often suffer from sparsity and noise, necessitating innovative solutions in \nmodel architecture. Second, developers should choose or develop tokenization strategies tailored \nto biological data. For instance, k-mer encoding works well for DNA/RNA sequences, while gene \nranking-based tokenization is effective for scRNA -seq data. Exploring hybrid tokenization can \nenhance cross-modal understanding. Third, in model development, developers should employ or \ndesign novel transformer structures. For example, scBERT utilizes Performer to improve \nscalability. Incorporating knowledge -based information into model training can further enhance \nperformance. For instance, GeneCompass integrates four types of biological  prior knowledge  \nincluding GRNs, promoter information, gene family annotation, and gene co -expression \nrelationships, making it versatile for various gene-related tasks. Similarly, basic protein language \nmodels, which are often limited to MSA and protein sequences, can be improved by incorporating \nadditional modalities like 3D structural data. This can be achieved by converting such modalities \ninto sequence formats or integrating large models to collectively capture multi-modal information \nusing fusion techniques. Moreover, combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with transformers \nhas led to significant advancements. For example, scMoFormer constructs cell -gene, gene-gene, \nprotein-protein, and gene-protein graphs for multi-omics predictions, while DeepMAPS uses cell-\ngene graphs to estimate gene importance. GNNs excel in capturing local interactions, while \ntransformers effectively model long-range dependencies, enabling comprehensive representations \nof intricate relationships in single-cell data. Fourth, novel tasks that can be explored in developing \nLLMs for bioinformatics include causal inference in multi-omics, such as determining how DNA \nvariations influence mRNA abundance or protein expression. Spatial transcriptomics \ninterpretation can model cell spatial organization within tissues. Epigenetic modulation prediction \nfocuses on regulatory roles of histone modifications, DNA methylation, or chromatin accessibility. \nSynthetic biology applications can involve generating optimized gene or protein sequences, while \ncross-species genomics identifies conserved functional genomic elements. These tasks exemplify \nhow LLMs can tackle emerging challenges in biological research. Fifth, developers should expand \nLLMs to accommodate emerging data types, such as CODEX imaging data and long -read \nsequencing data, which bring unique challenges in terms of data structure, preprocessing, and \nrepresentation. Lastly, validation, application, and interpretability should be prioritized. \nDevelopers should not only evaluate models on specific tasks but also ensure that foundational \nchallenges, such as the impact of sparsity in scRNA-seq data on cell type annotation performance, \nare fully addressed to enhance the robustness and utility of the models (Figure 5). \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to express our gratitude to our colleagues and friends who provided invaluable \nadvice and support throughout the duration of this study. \n \nFunding \nThis work was partially supported by the National Institutes of Health [ R01LM014156, \nR01GM153822, R01CA241930 to X.Z] and the National Science Foundation [2217515, 2326879 to \nX.Z].

Applications of large language models in bioinformatics include applications in genomics, \ntranscriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery  and single-cell analysis. Applications of LLMs in \ngenomics focus on LLMs using DNA sequence; applications of LLMs in transcriptomics focus on \nusing RNA sequence; applications of LLMs in proteomics focus on LLMs using protein sequence; \napplications of LLMs in drug discovery focus on LLMs using molecular data and applications of \nLLMs in single -cell analysis focus on LLMs using scRNA-seq, scMulti-omics and spatial \ntranscriptomics data. Each corresponds to a variety of biological downstream tasks. \n  \n\n \nFigure 2. Building blocks of large language models in bioinformatics. a, tokenization methods \ntailored to various data types, including DNA/RNA sequences, proteins, small molecules, and \nsingle-cell data. b, input embedding strategies used in large language models to encode tokenized \ndata. c, schematic representation of the transformer architecture, a foundational structure in LLMs. \nd, the attention mechanism, enabling models to focus on important features in sequences. e, the \nfeed-forward network, a critical component of transformers for learning hierarchical \n\nrepresentations. f, pre-training processes for BERT and GPT-based models, highlighting BERT's \nbidirectional prediction approach and GPT's left-to-right prediction strategy. \n  \n \nFigure 3. Schematic diagram of the large language model pretraining and fine-tuning process. \nThe workflow begins with tokenizing the input data, which is then fed into the embedding layer \nand transformer models. The training process comprises two stages: pretraining and fine -tuning. \nPretraining employs self -supervised learning on large -scale, unla beled reference datasets to \ndevelop a general-purpose model with robust generalization capabilities. Fine-tuning builds upon \nthe pretrained model, involving task -specific training to optimize performance for designated \napplications. \n  \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Downstream task s of large language models in bioinformatics. Large language \nmodels (LLMs) have seen numerous successful applications in bioinformatics, addressing a wide \narray of tasks across DNA, RNA, protein, drug discovery, and single-cell analysis. \n  \n \nFigure 5. Guidance for LLM users and developers on how to use and develop LLM in \npractice. Guidance for LLM users includes steps such as clarifying the task, selecting an \nappropriate model, preparing the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance. For \nLLM developers, the focus involves identifying domain -specific challenges, designing \ntokenization strategies, advancing model architectures, exploring novel tasks and data types, and \nassessing model capabilities comprehensively. \n \n \n\nTables \nTable 1.
