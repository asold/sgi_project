Introduction \nSeveral studies have investigated the use of artificial intelligence ( AI) in education. Chen et al. [1] focused on the \napplication of AI to help teachers manage administrative activities more effectively and adapt lesson plans to the unique \ndemands of each student, resulting in encouraging improvements in education’s overall quality. Dao et al. [2] integrated \ntext-to-speech and speech-driven-face technology to automatically create video lectures using the instructor’s voice and \nfacial expressions, lowering workload  and boosting learner engagement in online learning settings. Nguyen et al. [3] \nproposed an online learning platform that included a Vietnamese virtual assistant to help instructors with lesson \ndelivery and student assessment, combining presentation slid es with the instructor’s face, a synthesized voice, and \nsimple editing tools without the need for video capture. \nLarge Language Models (LLMs), a type of AI system, are trained on massive amounts of text data to understand \nnatural language and generate human -like responses. These models have become a potent tool for building chatbots \nwith appl ications in a variety of fields, including education. LLMs have the potential to revolutionize the way we \ninteract with technology and access information . The potential of LLMs in jobs like content creation, language \nLLMs Performance on Vietnamese High School Biology Examination \nVolume 15 (2023), Issue 6                                                                                                                                                                       15 \ntranslation, and instructional support  is enormous. Notable developments in LLMs include the release of BERT [4] by \nGoogle in 2018, its extension RoBERTa [5]  by Facebook in 2019, and T5 [6] by Google researchers in 2019. The 2020 \nrelease of OpenAI’s GPT -3 [7] received recognition for its outstanding results in a variety of  NLP tasks, even with a \nsmall amount of training data. \nThe potential for LLMs to revolutionize biology education is a topic of interest. However, a comprehensive \nunderstanding of their competence and limitations across different question types and difficul ty levels poses a \nsignificant challenge. Given that biology education involves the acquisition of factual knowledge, understanding of \ncontext, and the ability to apply critical thinking, it is crucial to assess the proficiency of LLMs in addressing these \ncomplexities. Given the aforementioned difficulties, the objective of this study is to conduct a thorough evaluation of \nChatGPT1, Microsoft's Bing Chat2 (BingChat), and Google Bard3 using the VNHSGE biology dataset [8]. Our objective \nis to provide insights that facilitate the effective integration of different models into educational platforms and \nassessment designs by highlighting their strengths and limitations. The primary objective is to make a valuable \ncontribution toward the adv ancement of customized LLM programs that are specifically designed to address the \ncomplexities of biology education. This will ultimately result in the promotion of a more enhanced and enriched \nlearning experience for students. \nThe topic of this article fo cuses on assessing LLMs' ability in relation to biology tests. The study provides various \ncontributions: (1) a thorough analysis of three cutting -edge LLMs, ChatGPT, BingChat, and Bard in the context of high \nschool biology education in Vietnam; (2) a compa rison of the performance of ChatGPT BingChat, and Bard with \nVietnamese students; and (3) a thorough investigation of the advantages and drawbacks of using LLMs in the field of \nbiology education in Vietnam. Through these contributions, this research highlig hts the issues that must be resolved for \nproper integration while illuminating the potential of LLMs to improve biology education.  \n2.  Related Work \n2.1.  Large Language Models \nChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI and based on the GPT -3.5 architecture, has the ability to provide \nhuman-like responses in natural language. It has the potential to be used in intelligent tutoring programs that enable \nassessment activities, offe r tailored feedback, and automate grading procedures. BingChat, based on the GPT -4 \narchitecture4, acts as a chatbot function within the Bing search engine and has a lot of potential as a teaching tool \nbecause it can deliver factual information. Google Bard  is an experimental, conversational AI chat service developed by \nGoogle that was initially powered by Google’s Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) 5  and later \nupgraded to use Google’s most advanced LLM, PaLM. These AI -powered solutions have the  potential to revolutionize \neducation by providing trustworthy and accessible educational support to both teachers and students.  \n2.2.  Biology datasets for evaluation of LLMs \nDue to their thorough training with enormous volumes of  data, LLMs have outstanding natural language \ncomprehension abilities. They are therefore excellent candidates for upholding academic and professional standards, \nespecially in the area of biology education. For LLMs working in the field of biology, existin g datasets like BioASQ [9] \nand SciQ [10] provide challenges. When it addresses tasks like question-answering and biomedical semantic indexing, \nBioASQ generally concentrates on the medical sector as opposed to the biological one. The SciQ dataset, on the other \nhand, utilizes multiple-choice questions to assess LLMs' understanding of and rational e for biological science principles. \nThe dataset presents a considerable challenge for LLMs because it contains 13,679 science exam questions from \ndisciplines including biology, chemistry, and physics as well as supporting data for the correct responses. T he biology \ndataset offered in MMLU dataset [11] also includes material from high school and college biology courses, covering a \nvariety of topic s like natural selection, heredity, the cell cycle, the Krebs cycle, cellular structure, molecular biology, \nand ecology. This dataset is used to evaluate the precision of LLMs in certain particular biological domains.  A \nmultimodal technique has been introd uced in ScienceQA dataset [12], with a focus on molecular and cellular biology. \nWith matching lectures, explanations, and photos captioned, it has approximately 21,000 multiple -choice queries. In \ncomparison to earlier datasets, this dataset offers a wide variety of research topics and annotations, which helps to create \na broader domain diversity.  Despite LLMs' promise to revolutionize education, they still need to do better in certain \nareas, like biology. On the AP Biology dataset,  ChatGPT-3.5 achieves an accuracy range of 62% to 85%, according to \nthe GPT-4 Report by OpenAI [13]. This shows that although LLMs like ChatGPT have a promising future in educatio n, \nmore work needs to be done to improve their accuracy and performance in biologically -related activities.  VNHSGE \nbiology dataset [8] encompasses information derived from the Vietnamese National High School Graduation \nExamination. This comprehensive dataset encompasses a wide array of biological topics, including genetic principles, \npopulation genetics, genetic applications, human genetics, evolution, ecology, plant organismal biology, and numerous \n                                                           \n1 https://chat.openai.com/  \n2 https://www.bing.com/chat  \n3 https://bard.google.com/  \n4 Confirmed: the new Bing runs on OpenAI’s GPT-4 | Bing Search Blog  \n5 Google AI updates: Bard and new AI features in Search (blog.google)  \nLLMs Performance on Vietnamese High School Biology Examination \n16                                                                                                                                                                       Volume 15 (2023), Issue 6 \nother facets of the field. It is essential to note that this dataset poses a formidable challenge to large language models \ndue to the intricate nature of inference tasks and the complexity of the Vietnamese language.  \n2.3.  Evaluation of LLMs on biology   \nThe st udy conducted by Agathokleous et al. [1 4] examines the effects and investigates the practical uses and \nconsequences of AI LLMs in the fields of biology and environmental science. The article examines the potential \nadvantages of LLMs in diverse domains, inc luding education, research, publishing, outreach, and societal translation. \nThe paper extends its analysis by presenting illustrative instances via interactive sessions with LLM, thereby \nshowcasing its capacity to streamline intricate undertakings. In a se parate scholarly investigation, Tong et al. [1 5] \nexamine the ramifications of ChatGPT within the domain of Synthetic Biology. This study investigates the potential of \nutilizing ChatGPT for the purpose of comprehending research patterns and enhancing resear ch endeavors within this \nparticular field. The paper acknowledges the dual nature of the sentiments surrounding the impact of LLMs on society \nand research, encompassing both enthusiasm and apprehension. In an alternative perspective, Kumar et al. [1 6] analyze \nthe usefulness and advantages of ChatGPT in the realm of academic writing within the field of biomedical sciences. The \nevaluation encompasses the measurement of various aspects, including the speed of response, the caliber of content, the \ndependability, and the level of novelty exhibited in the text generated by ChatGPT. The research acknowledges the \nvarious strengths and limitations associated with the use of ChatGPT in the context of academic writing. Finally, Shue \net al. [17] propose an iterative mod el that aims to refine instructions for guiding a chatbot, specifically ChatGPT, in the \ngeneration of code for bioinformatics data analysis tasks. This study evaluates the viability of implementing this model \nin various bioinformatics domains and examines the practical considerations and constraints associated with utilizing \nsuch a model for chatbot -supported bioinformatics instruction. The papers under review collectively highlight the \nsignificant influence of LLMs on different fields such as biology, envi ronmental science, synthetic biology, academic \nwriting in biomedical sciences, and bioinformatics. The authors emphasize the possible advantages and difficulties \nlinked to the incorporation of LLMs within these domains. Through the execution of our researc h, our objective is to \nmake a scholarly contribution to the ongoing discussion pertaining to the responsible and efficient incorporation of \nLLMs, namely ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Bard, within the realms of biology education.  \n3.  Methods \nFig.1 illustrates the evaluation process of LLMs on the VNHSGE biology dataset. Firstly, the Vietnamese National \nHigh School Graduation Examination biology test is converted into a text format so that LLMs can understand it, with \nmathematical formulas and symbols being convert ed into LaTeX format. Next, the questions in text format are sent to \nthe LLMs API via the zero-shot method. Finally, the LLMs’ responses are scored, analyzed, and evaluated.  \n \n \nFig. 1. Evaluation of LLMs on VNHSGE biology dataset \n3.1 Dataset \nThe biology questions in the VNHSGE dataset [8] are exceedingly challenging and intricate, necessitating a \nthorough understanding of biology in order to provide adequate answers. The VNHSGE dataset tests students' biology \nknowledge and abilities with a variety of questions of varying complexity. The dataset's questions are categorized as \n\"knowledge\" (easy), \"comprehension\" (intermediate), \"application\" (difficult), and \"high application\" (very difficult). \nThe dataset is intended to b e made up of 75% theoretical questions and 25% exercises, with a focus on higher -order \nthinking abilities and applications making up 30% of the questions and knowledge and comprehension levels being \nassessed by the remaining 70%. The dataset includes a ran ge of questions, with an emphasis on the capacity for \ncalculation and inference. While comprehension -level questions only call for one to three steps of deductive reasoning, \nknowledge-level questions necessitate a thorough understanding of biology. Applica tion-level questions concentrate on \nissues including genetic principles, population genetics, inheritance mechanisms, and mutation, requiring the synthesis \nof knowledge. High application -level questions provide another level of complexity because they requ ire on extensive \nanalysis and problem -solving abilities. Due to the complex nature of the VNHSGE biology dataset, LLMs encounter \nsubstantial challenges in comprehending and answering questions that cover a range of biology topics correctly.  \n \n\nLLMs Performance on Vietnamese High School Biology Examination \nVolume 15 (2023), Issue 6                                                                                                                                                                       17 \n3.2 Prompt \nIn this investigation, zero -shot evaluation was employed to gauge the effectiveness of LLMs in the evaluation of \nthe VNHSGE dataset denoted as D. This dataset comprises a collection of question -answer pairs, designated as Q and S, \nrespectively, where S represents the ground truth solutions. Th e contextual information represented by the term P is \ndefined. LLMs’ answer A is computed according to the formula presented below: \n \n                                                                                  A = f(P, Q)                                                                                  (1) \n \nHere, the function f is embodied by LLMs and takes into consideration both the context P and the question Q. The \ncontext P, in this instance, is a specific structure that guides the response o f LLMs. It instructs LLMs to generate the \nanswer in the following format: (Choice: \"A\" or \"B\" or \"C\" or \"D\"; Explanation: Explain the answer; The question is: \n[the actual question]). By adhering to this format, LLMs generates its response A, which can subs equently be assessed \nand compared against the ground truth solution S. In the case of multiple -choice questions sourced from the VNHSGE \ndataset, the questions are adapted to align with the expected answer format and are then sent to the LLMs' API . \n3.3 Grading \nTo assess the performance of LLMs in responding to questions, we conducted an evaluation by comparing LLMs' \nresponses to the ground truth solution. The evaluation process was executed through a binary grading system, whereby \nthe response provided by LLMs w as categorized as either correct or incorrect. The ground truth solution S for each \nquestion Q was determined by a human expert. The response A generated by LLMs was subsequently compared to the \nground truth solution using the subsequent equation: \n \n                                                                               G = g(Q, S, A)                                                                                 (2) \n4.  Experimental Results and Discussion \n4.1 Performance evaluation \nFig.2a illustrates LLMs performance on VNHSGE biology dataset  while Fig.2b shows their consistent responses.  \nIt is observed that Bard distinguishes itself with a mean performance score of 69.5% on the VNHSGE dataset, \nsuggesting a tendency to produce a greater number of accurate responses to biology questions compared to other models. \nThis observation implies that Bard possesses a co mprehensive understanding of concepts related to biology and is \ncapable of delivering precise and reliable responses within this field. Meanwhile, the performance of BingChat is \nnotable, as it exhibits a robust accuracy rate of 69.0%. It is worth mentionin g that BingChat consistently demonstrates a \ncommendable performance in addressing inquiries related to biology, as evidenced by its relatively limited range of \nperformance, spanning from 65.0% to 72.5%. The attribute of consistency is highly advantageous f or an educational \ntool. Another finding is that t he performance of ChatGPT, despite exhibiting the lowest mean performance of 58%, \nmanaged to attain a commendable degree of accuracy. It is noteworthy to mention that ChatGPT exhibited a marginally \nsuperior level of consistency in comparison to BingChat. This implies that ChatGPT could potentially serve as a \ndependable choice for educational applications, despite exhibiting a comparatively lower average accuracy.  \nFurthermore, one intriguing observation pertai ns to the notable variability observed in Bard's responses, which span a \nrange from 60.0% to 77.5%. Although Bard attained the highest average accuracy, the presence of variability suggests \nthat its responses may occasionally lack consistency. The observed  variability in LLM responses could potentially be an \naspect that warrants further attention, especially in relation to the dependability of these responses within educational \ncontexts. \nIn general, the findings of this study suggest that the three LLMs, na mely Bard, BingChat, and ChatGPT, exhibit \npromise for educational utilization within the domain of high school biology. Bard and BingChat exhibit commendable \nperformance with elevated mean accuracies, whereas ChatGPT, while marginally less accurate on aver age, showcases \ncommendable consistency. Nevertheless, it is imperative to take into account the balance between precision and \nuniformity when choosing an LLM for educational objectives, as both aspects play a role in the dependability of these \nmodels in supporting students and instructors in the field of biology education. Additional refinement and optimization \nefforts have the potential to improve the performance and reliability of these LLMs in the context of educational \napplications. \nLLMs Performance on Vietnamese High School Biology Examination \n18                                                                                                                                                                       Volume 15 (2023), Issue 6 \n  \na. Performance b. Stability of LLMs response \nFig. 2. Performance of LLMs on VNHSGE biology dataset  \n4.2 LLMs capabilities in different question levels \nAn essential component of this study involved examining the efficacy of various LLMs in addressing challenging -\nlevel inquiries. The objective of the analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of ChatGPT, BingChat, and Bard in addressing \nvarious categories of ch allenging inquiries. The findings of the analysis are succinctly presented in Fig.3b, which \nillustrates the proportion of accurate responses across different categories of challenging questions for ChatGPT, \nBingChat, and Bard. The taxonomy of inquiries enc ompasses Knowledge -based inquiries, Comprehension -based \ninquiries, Application -based inquiries, and High Application -based inquiries (refer to Fig.3a). The following are the \nprincipal discoveries:  \n \n  \na) b) \nFig. 3. a) Question levels proportion, and b) Performance of LLMs on question levels \nFirst, knowledge questions are commonly associated with the retrieval of factual information. Both BingChat and \nBard exhibited a significantly higher level of accuracy (92.11%) in responding to these inquiries when c ompared to \nChatGPT (71%). The reason behind this is that BingChat and Bard use extensive training data and painstaking fine -\ntuning to provide accurate and reliable information. The models may have been exposed to a variety of real facts, \nimproving their capacity to retrieve reliable information. Students seeking succinct explanations and definitions can use \nBingChat and Bard to quickly and accurately answer knowledge -based questions. However, these sources may not \nalways provide complete explanations or contextual information, limiting their use in complex dialogue. \nSecond, comprehension questions pertain to the process of comprehending and interpreting provided information. \nAll three models demonstrated comparable levels of accuracy in answering these questions. ChatGPT and Bard \nachieved an accuracy rate of approxima tely 61.82%, while BingChat slightly outperformed them in this regard. The \nsimilar efficacy of all three models in facilitating students' comprehension and interpretation of biology -related \ninformation indicates their overall capacity to grasp and elucidat e concepts. This suggests that students have the option \nto refer to any of these models as a resource for understanding the content of a biology text, diagram, or concept. \nEducators have the opportunity to integrate these models into their instructional ma terials, thereby offering students \nsupplementary explanations and alternative viewpoints, thereby augmenting their comprehension and fostering their \ncritical thinking abilities. \nThird, the application questions, which necessitate the utilization of acquire d knowledge in specific scenarios, were \nfound to be more difficult. Among the evaluated systems, BingChat demonstrated the most notable accuracy within this \nspecific category, achieving a percentage of 41.67%. Subsequently, Bard attained a lower accuracy r ate of 33.33%, \nwhile ChatGPT exhibited the lowest accuracy of 25.0%. This implies that although BingChat and Bard exhibit a greater \ncapacity for the application of knowledge in practical situations, all models encounter challenges in this regard.  \n\nLLMs Performance on Vietnamese High School Biology Examination \nVolume 15 (2023), Issue 6                                                                                                                                                                       19 \nFinally, high -application questions nec essitate the utilization of advanced analytical skills and the capacity to \nintegrate knowledge in intricate situations. In this category, Bard demonstrated the highest level of accuracy, achieving \na rate of 16.67%. Following closely behind was ChatGPT with  a rate of 29.1%. Conversely, BingChat did not produce \nany correct responses within this category. This underscores the notable difficulties that the models encounter when \nconfronted with inquiries that necessitate advanced cognitive abilities and the synt hesis of ideas.

False. Since there is only 1 gene determining the fur color and 4 \nalleles on the normal chromosome, there can be a maximum of 4 \ndifferent genotypes. \nII. False. Based solely on the F1 phenotype ratios, we cannot accurately \ndetermine the genotypes of the P mice. For example, b oth alleles a and \nb can produce black fur, so we cannot determine which P mouse carries \nallele a and which carries allele b. \nIII. False. This cannot happen because the fur color trait is determined \nby a single gene and is unrelated to the mating between mice. \nIV. True. Allele a is dominant over allele f, and allele f is dominant \nover allele e. Therefore, when mouse a mates with mouse f, the \noffspring can have a ratio of 50% black fur and 50% yellow fur. \nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 1. \n \n BingChat:  The number of correct statements is A. 2. Statements I and \nII are correct. Statement I is correct because the 3:1 phenotypic ratio in \nthe F1 generation of cross 1 suggests that the brown fur phenotype is \ndetermined by a homozygous recessive genotype. State ment II is \ncorrect because based on the phenotypic ratios in the F1 generation of \nthe crosses, we can determine that individuals a and b are heterozygous \n(Aa), individual c is homozygous dominant (AA), and individual d is \nhomozygous recessive (aa). Statements III and IV are incorrect. \nLLMs Performance on Vietnamese High School Biology Examination \n26                                                                                                                                                                       Volume 15 (2023), Issue 6 \nBard: Đáp án: C. 3 \nGiải thí ch: \n* Cho con (d) giao ph ối với con (e) t ạo ra đ ời con có  tỉ lệ kiểu gen \ngiống tỉ lệ kiểu hì nh. \n- Kiểu gen của con (d): A_a \n- Kiểu gen của con (e): a_A \n- Tỉ lệ kiểu gen đời con: 1/2 A_a: 1/2 a_A \n- Tỉ lệ kiểu hình đời con: 1/2 lô ng trắng: 1/2 lô ng nâ u \n* Cho con (a) giao ph ối với con (f), đ ời con có  thể có  tỉ lệ 50% con \nlông đen: 50% con lông vàng. \n- Kiểu gen của con (a): A_A \n- Kiểu gen của con (f): a_a \n- Tỉ lệ kiểu gen đời con: 1/2 A_A: 1/2 a_a \n- Tỉ lệ kiểu hình đời con: 1/2 lông đen: 1/2 lô ng và ng \nVậy, có  3 phá t biểu đúng. \nBard: Answer: C. 3 \nExplanation: \nF1 offspring from (d) x (e) have a genotype ratio equal to the \nphenotype ratio. \nGenotype of (d): A_a \nGenotype of (e): a_A \nGenotype ratio in F1 offspring: 1/2 A_a: 1/2 a_A \nPhenotype ratio in F1 offspring: 1/2 white coat: 1/2 brown coat \nF1 offspring from (a) x (f) can have a 50% black coat: 50% yellow coat \nratio. \nGenotype of (a): A_A \nGenotype of (f): a_a \nGenotype ratio in F1 offspring: 1/2 A_A: 1/2 a_a \nPhenotype ratio in F1 offspring: 1/2 black coat: 1/2 yellow coat \nTherefore, there are 3 correct statements. \nIn this instance, only Bard provides the correct answer, while ChatGPT and BingChat provide incorrect responses. \n \nCâ u hỏi: Một loà i thực vật lưỡng bội, xé t 3 cặp gen: A, a; B, b và  D, d \ntrê n 3 cặp NST cùng quy đ ịnh mà u hoa; kiểu gen có  alen A, alen B và  \nalen D quy định hoa tí m; kiểu gen chỉ có alen A và alen B quy định hoa \nđỏ; cá c kiểu gen cò n lại quy định hoa trắng.

However, these language models can provide accurate r esponses in some circumstances due to \ntheir exposure to comparable queries in their training data or their capacity to find pertinent material online. The \ninternet is a useful tool for LLMs, enabling them to look up pertinent material and obtain additional  viewpoints and \ninsights. However, relying on existing knowledge and internet research may have its drawbacks, particularly in difficult \nand subtle high application -level biology topics. Breakthroughs must be made in training techniques, data curation, and  \nreasoning skills for LLMs to perform better when answering high application -level queries. Their capacity to accurately \ninfer and respond to complicated biology problems can be improved by including more varied and difficult question \nsets, improving inference algorithms, and expanding domain-specific expertise.

B ased on the temperature range of each breed and the \ntemperature fluctuations throughout the months and years in this area, it \ncan be observed that Breed A is suitable for free-ranging in this area. \nII - False. If Breed D is raised from February, it will ex perience \ntemperature fluctuations outside its ecological limits, resulting in poor \ndevelopment. \nIII - False. The temperature ecological limit of Breed C deviates \nsignificantly from the temperature range of this area. \nIV - Correct. Comparing the temperature  limits of Breed B with the \ncontinuous six-month period in this area, it is evident that the temperature \nrequirements are not met. \nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \nChatGPT: Nhì n và o biểu đ ồ, gi ới h ạn sinh  thá i về nhiệt đ ộ của \ntừng giống vật nuô i và  yê u cầu về thời gian sinh trư ởng, ta có  thể \nsuy ra cá c nhận định sau đây: \nI.

Khô ng thể nuô i giống D t ừ tháng hai đ ể đảm bảo năng su ất \nkhi xuất chuồng là  cao nhất, vì  giới hạn sinh thá i của giống D và o \nkhoảng nhiệt độ 18-29° C và  thời gian sinh trư ởng tối thiểu là  160 \nngày, do đó không có thời gian đủ để nuô i giống D từ tháng hai đến \ntháng chín để đạt được năng suất cao nhất khi xuất chuồng. \nIII. Giống C là  phù  hợp nhất để chăn thả ở vù ng nà y, vì  giới hạn \nsinh thá i của gi ống C r ộng và  phù  hợp với môi trư ờng, thời gian \nsinh trưởng tối thiểu của giống C là  160 ngà y, phù  hợp với yê u cầu \nvề thời gian xuất chuồng. \nIV. Giống B có  giới hạn sinh thá i khá  rộng và  có  thể chăn thả ở \nvù ng nà y, tuy nhiê n, yê u cầu thời gian sinh trư ởng tối thiểu là  200 \nngày, vượt quá  thời gian t ối thiểu là 160 ngày đ ể đảm bảo đủ thời \ngian xu ất chu ồng, do đó không th ể nuôi được gi ống B trong 160 \nngày để xuất chuồng ở vù ng nà y. \nVì  vậy, có  3 nhận định đúng: II, III, IV, đáp án là B. 3 \nChatGPT: Based on the temperature ecological limits of each animal \nbreed and the growth time r equirements, we can infer the following \nstatements: \nI. Breed A is not suitable for free -ranging in this area because its \necological limits may not ensure their survival during winter (December to \nFebruary) when temperatures drop low. \nII. It is not possible  to raise Breed D starting from the second month to \nensure the highest productivity at the time of release, as its ecological \nlimits fall within the temperature range of 18 -29° C, and the minimum \ngrowth time required is 160 days. Therefore, there is not eno ugh time to \nraise Breed D from February to September to achieve the highest \nproductivity at the time of release. \nIII. Breed C is the most suitable for free -ranging in this area because its \necological limits are broad and compatible with the environment, an d the \nminimum growth time for Breed C is 160 days, which aligns with the time \nrequired for release. \nIV. Breed B has a relatively wide ecological limit and can be raised in this \narea. However, the minimum growth time required is 200 days, exceeding \nthe mini mum of 160 days needed to ensure sufficient time for release. \nTherefore, it is not possible to raise Breed B within 160 days for release in \nthis area. \nTherefore, there are 3 correct statements: II, III, IV, and the answer is B. 3. \nBingChat: Based on the information in Table 1 and Table 2, we can determine which animal breeds are suitable for rearing in this region. Breed \nA has an ecological temperature range of 12 -32° C. According to Table 1, the minimum temperature in this region is 1.5° C in January and th e \nmaximum temperature is 34° C in July. This means that breed A can survive in this region for most of the year, but may not sur vive during the \ncoldest and hottest months. Therefore, statement I is incorrect. \nBreed D has an ecological temperature range of 5-25° C. If breed D is reared starting in February, the minimum temperature would be 5° C and the \nmaximum temperature would be 15° C. Over the next 160 days (about 5 months), the maximum temperature would reach 32.5° C in June, which is \nabove the upper limit of breed D’s ecological temperature range. Therefore, statement II is incorrect. \nBreed C has an ecological temperature range of 14 -40° C. According to Table 1, the minimum temperature in this region is 1.5° C in January and \nthe maximum temperature is 34° C in July. This means that breed C can survive in this region for most of the year, but may not survive during the \ncoldest months. Therefore, statement III is incorrect. \nBreed B has an ecological temperature range of 8-26° C. According to Table 1, the minimum temperature in this region is 1.5° C in January and the \nmaximum temperature is 34° C in July. This means that breed B cannot survive in this region for a full 160 days due to both lo w and high \ntemperatures outside its ecological temperature range. Therefore, statement IV is correct. \nIn conclusion, only one of the statements (IV) is correct. The correct answer is D. 1. \nBard: Đáp án đúng là (A) 2. \nNhận định I đúng vì gi ống A có  giới hạn nhiệt độ thí ch hợp nằm \ntrong khoảng nhiệt độ trung bì nh của vù ng nà y. \nNhận định II sai vì  nhiệt độ trung bì nh của vù ng nà y từ thá ng 2 \nđến tháng 5 là dưới giới hạn nhiệt độ thí ch hợp của giống B. Do đó, \nnếu bắt đầu nuô i giống B từ tháng 2 thì năng su ất khi xuất chuồng \nsẽ khô ng cao nhất. \nNhận định III sai vì  giống C có  giới hạn nhiệt độ thí ch hợp nằm \ntrong kho ảng nhi ệt đ ộ trung bì nh của vùng này. Do đó, gi ống C \nkhô ng phải là  giống phù  hợp nhất để chăn thả ở vù ng nà y. \nNhận định IV đúng vì nhiệt độ trung bì nh của vù ng nà y từ thá ng \n1 đến thá ng 11 là  trê n giới hạn nhiệt độ thí ch hợp của giống B. Do \nđó, không thể nuô i giống B trong 160 ngày đ ể xuất chuồng ở vù ng \nnà y. \nVậy, có  2 nhận định đúng trong số cá c nhận định đã cho. \nBard: The correct answer is (A) 2. \nStatement I is correct because the temperature range of breed A is \nwithin the average temperature range of the region. \nStatement II is incorrect because the average temperature of the region \nfrom February to May is below the temperature range of breed B. \nTherefore, if breed B is raised from February, the yield at the time of sale \nwill not be the highest. \nStatement III is incorrect because the temperature range of breed C is \nwithin the average temperature range of the region. Therefore, breed C is \nnot the most suitable breed for grazing in this region. \nStatement IV is correct because the a verage temperature of the region \nfrom January to November is above the temperature range of breed B. \nTherefore, it is not possible to raise breed B for 160 days to sell in this \nregion. \nTherefore, there are 2 correct statements among the given statements. \nIn this particular case, Bard alone furnishes the accurate solution, whereas ChatGPT and BingChat supply incorrect answers. \n \nLLMs Performance on Vietnamese High School Biology Examination \nVolume 15 (2023), Issue 6                                                                                                                                                                       29 \nCâ u hỏi: Phả hệ sau đây (Hì nh 7) mô  tả sự di truyền bệnh A và  bệnh \nB.

Let's examine the probabilities of the \npossible genotypes for the couple III.2 and III.3: \nGenotype of III.2: AB, Ab, aB, or ab, with equal probabilities of 1/4 \neach. \nGenotype of III.3: AAbb. \nTo have a first -born son who is not affected by disease A, we need to \nselect a gamete from III.2 carrying the allele a and a gamete from III.3 \ncarrying the allele A, which means selecting the gametes Ab and Ab. The \nprobability of this is 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8. Therefore, the probability of having \na first -born son who is not affected by disease A and disease B in the \ncouple III.2 and III.3 is: \nProbability = Probability of having a first -born son without disease A * \nProbability of having a first -born son without disease B (both parents do \nnot carry the allele for disease B) = 1/8 ∗  1 =  1/8. \nThus, the correct answer is A. 51/160. \n\nLLMs Performance on Vietnamese High School Biology Examination \n30                                                                                                                                                                       Volume 15 (2023), Issue 6 \nBingChat BingChat: no answer \nBard: Đáp án: C. \nXá c suất sinh con trai khô ng bị bệnh và khô ng bị bệnh  của cặp vợ \nchồng III. 2 và  III.3 là : \n* Xá c suất cặp vợ chồng III. 2 và  III.3 sinh con trai là : 1/2. \n* Xá c suất con trai khô ng bị bệnh  là : 1 −  1/4 =  3/4. \n* Xá c suất con trai khô ng bị bệnh  là : 1 −  1/4 =  3/4. \nVậy xá c suất chung là : 1/2 𝑥 3/4 𝑥 3/4 =  9/32 =  3/40. \nVậy đáp án đúng là C. \nBard: Answer: C. \nThe probability of a son of couple III.2 and III.3 being born without \ndisease and without disease is: \nThe probability of couple III.2 and III.3 having a son is: 1/2. \nThe probability of a son not being affected by disease is: 1 −  1/4 =\n 3/4. \nThe probability of a son not being affected by disease is: 1 −  1/4 =\n 3/4. \nTherefore, the overall probability is: 1/2 𝑥 3/4 𝑥 3/4 =  9/32 =  3/\n40. \nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \nIn this instance, ChatGPT provides the correct answer by demonstrating relatively good mathematical ability, while Bard provi des an \nincorrect response and BingChat does not provide an answer. \n \n \n \n \nHow to cite this paper: Xuan-Quy Dao, Ngoc -Bich Le, \"LLMs Performance on Vietnamese High School Biology Examination \", \nInternational Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science(IJMECS), Vol.1 5, No. 6, pp. 14-30, 202 3. \nDOI:10.5815/ijmecs.2023.06.02 \n \n \n "
