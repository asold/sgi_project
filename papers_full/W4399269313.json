  "abstract": "Abstract As consumer electronics and tensor computation for machine learning (ML) continue to advance, model execution and training become more accessible. NVIDIA introduced the RTX 4090 graphics cards, marketed initially as gamer-oriented products, in late 2022. Though relatively expensive for consumer use, their manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of 1600 USD makes them affordable as a professional tool. These cards’ extensive video random access memory (vRAM), computational power comparable to last-generation flagship professional cards, and ability to use single-byte floats enable a pair of them to train, fine-tune, and run on-premises Large Language Models (LLMs) with up to 7 billion parameters per card. Until this release, such a feat would have required data center-level equipment. Although the RTX 4090 and H100 GPU represent a qualitative step forward, iterative improvements combined with the speculated lowering of computational precision to half-byte floats could make larger models even more accessible for on-premises use. This development might, in one aspect, lower the entry barrier for cyberattackers, simplifying the process for advanced persistent threats (APTs) to camouflage their activities amidst unsophisticated attackers or those employing generative LLMs for non-malicious purposes. Conversely, as an alternative to cloud-hosted models, on-site LLMs may limit the possibility of private information leakage or model poisoning while offering specialized capabilities for legitimate users.",
