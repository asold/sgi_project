The\nproposed approach is based on the A–V–A formulation in which\nthe eddy current field and the electric circuit equations are solved\nsimultaneously. The effectiveness of a magnetic bypass plate near\nthe coils ends for reducing the eddy current loss and the local over-\nheating is discussed. A simulation to study the transient short-cir-\ncuit behavior of a 720-MV A power transformer using the proposed\ncoupled approach is reported.\nIndex Terms— Eddy current loss, power transformer, transient\nforce.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nT\nHE ELECTROMAGNETIC forces on the windings of\nlarge transformer due to short circuits are generally\ndetrimental. A three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear transient\nelectromagnetic field is necessary when studying these tran-\nsient short-circuiting forces. A transient field study using\ncurrent source has been reported [1]. However, most large\ntransformers are connected to constant voltage sources, and the\nshort-circuit currents in the coils are unknown. Recently, there\nare algorithms to couple the magnetic and electric circuits in\nthe simulation of motors [2], [3], turbo-generators, and other\ndevices [4]–[6].\nCommon measures to alleviate the eddy current and over-\nheating problems are to reduce the magnetic flux density in the\nmetallic clamping plates and tank walls. Shields and metals with\nlow permeability are also used to reduce the eddy current losses.\nHowever, these measures are insufficient for large transformers\nrated up to 720 MV A. Indeed large transformers are commonly\nfitted with magnetic bypass (MBP) plates near the coil ends to\nreduce the eddy current losses.\nUnlike the normal pie windings in conventional transformers\nwith negligible axial current and torsional forces [7], the spiral\ncoils in large transformers may be acted upon by torsional forces\ndue to the presence of axial component of the current. Test re-\nsults show that coil damages due to torsional force are not un-\ncommon; hence, it is necessary to calculate the distribution of\ntorsional force on the coils.\nManuscript received July 1, 2003.\nS.

Magnetic Field and Electric Circuit Coupled Equations\nEquations (2) and (4) give the following coupled equation:\n(5)\nThe Newton-Raphson algorithm is used to take into account\nof the magnetic nonlinearity.\nIII. A NALYSIS AND CALCULATION\nEquations (1)–(5) are employed to compute the transient eddy\ncurrent fields and the electromagnetic forces upon the coils in\na 720-MV A/500 kV transformer. Fig. 1 shows a sketch of the\nstructure of a transformer with a magnetic bypass plate.\nTo validate the approach presented in this paper, a 17-MV A\ntransformer is selected as the magnetic field test model. The cor-\nresponding calculated values of magnetic flux density on the\nsurface of the iron core and the tested results are given in Table\nI, which shows that the calculated results agree well with the\nmeasured ones. For electric equations with known terminal volt-\nages, the coupled method is the most suitable one for transient\nanalyses of the transformer.\nAs it is difficult to measure the short-circuit (SC) forces of the\n720-MV A power transformer, the short-circuit tests have been\ndone on two smaller transformers. The forces on the up yoke\nof the iron core are measured by using pressure force sensors\nbetween the press plate and the clamp plate. Table II shows the\ncomputed and tested results.\nThe primary short-circuit currents are shown in Fig. 2. It can\nbe seen that the current computed using traditional method in\nwhich the inductance and the resistance of the transformer are\ntreated as constants is slightly larger than that obtained from\nthe field-circuit coupled method, which has a maximum current\nerror of about 16.7%.\nTABLE II\nSC FORCE ACTING ON THE UP YOKE OF CORE\nFig. 2. Primary short-circuit currents.\nFig. 3. Distribution of axial forces of coil-sections.\nA. Short-Circuit Forces on the Coils\nThe mechanical strength of the high voltage (HV) coil and\nthe mechanical stability of the low voltage (LV) coil are key in-\ndicators in assessing the robustness of the transformer against\nshort-circuit damages. Hence, the distribution of the forces on\nthe coils and the time variation of the forces have to be computed\nfor subsequent mechanical analysis. Fig. 3 depicts the distribu-\ntions of the axial electromagnetic force of the coil sections in\nthe B-phase LV and HV coils along the\ndirection (height of\nthe coil). From Fig. 3 it can be seen that axial forces of sec-\ntions near the end regions of the coils are larger than those near\nthe middle of the coils because of the radial magnetic flux den-\nsity and the nonuniform distribution of ampere-turns along the\nheight of coils. Fig. 4 gives the distribution of radial forces on\nthe coil sections.\nIn general, most power transformers are studied as pie coil\nmodels with no axial short-circuit current. Unlike traditional\nones, the 720-MV A transformer uses spiral coils with axial cur-\nrents. Fig. 5 shows the distributions of the torsional force on the\nB-phase LV coil along the\ndirection (height of coil). It can be\nseen that the torsional force of the coil sections near the end re-\ngion of the windings is larger than those near the middle.\nIn order to study the behavior of the coils due to the short-\ncircuit forces, it is necessary to check the mechanical robustness\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Distribution of the radial forces on the B-phase coils along the height\nof the coils.\nFig. 5. Distribution of the torsional force on the B-phase low-voltage coil\nalong the\n/122 direction (height of coil).\nand stability of the coils. To calculate the mechanical stress of\nthe HV coil, the coil is simplified as a ring model with uniform\ncircumferential supporting bars as well as cushion blocks and\nspace beam elements to describe the model. If the maximum\nradial forces of the HV coil sections are assumed as static load,\nthe static mechanical strength analysis can be carried out. The\ncomputed maximum static stress is 85 MPa, which acts on a coil\nsection at a location with a height of 1280 mm on the coil.\nBesides the maximum static stress, the dynamic stresses of\nthe coil sections need to be analyzed too. In the short-circuit\ntest of a large power transformer, the test time is usually 200\nms. In the dynamic mechanical strength analysis, the stress of\nthe coil sections during the test must be determined. Fig. 6 gives\nthe maximum stress of the HV coil sections along the\ndirection\nof the coil. The maximum dynamic stress is 59.6 MPa, which is\nless than the allowable stress of 100 –160 MPa for the copper\nwire in the coil. Hence, the test shows that the coils do have\nsufficient mechanical rigidity to withstand the short-circuit im-\npacts. Fig. 7 shows the time variation of the stress of one coil\nsection at a height of 1280 mm on the B-phase HV coil.\nFor low-voltage coils, the maximum radial force of the coil\nsections in the transformer is 23 207 N/m, which is less than\ncollapsing critical force of 36 355 N/m in the radial direction.\nHence, there is no radial destabilization danger for the coil.\nB. Eddy Current Field Calculation\nDue to transportation constraints, the physical size of the\n720-MV A transformer is very compact, and hence, its elec-\ntromagnetic load density is very large. The field will induce\nFig. 6. Maximum stress of the HV coil sections.\nFig. 7. Time variation of the stress of a coil section 1280 mm in height of the\nB-phase HV coil.\nFig. 8.

In the\ntransformer, all the clamp plates are made of the steel with\nlow magnetic permeability in order to alleviate the problem.\nIn order to obtain an accurate distribution of the leakage\nmagnetic field in the 720-MV A transformer, some tests have\nbeen done in which the electromagnetic fields on the outside\nsurface of the C-phase HV coil, on the up clamp and on the\ninside surface of the tank wall have been measured. In the\nregion of the clamp plate corresponding to the center lines of\nC-phase coils, the maximum\nis 126 mT, which is larger\nthan the critical overheating criterion value of 26.7 mT. The\nmaximum loss density is 46 kW/m\n before installing the MBP\nplates. In the single-phase transformer model of the 720-MV A\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Magnetic flux density /66\n on the area of the up clamp plate.\nTABLE III\nLOSS DENSITY IN THE CLAMPING PLATE\ntransformer, the overheating problem in the clamp plates has\nbeen measured using infrared radiation thermometer. Besides\nusing low magnetic permeability steel clamp plates, a magnetic\nbypassing plate scheme is designed to reduce the losses of the\nclamp plates to solve the local overheating problem. The MBP\nplates, which are made of silicon sheets, are installed near the\nclamp plates so as to provide a path for the leakage magnetic\nfield at the end of the three phase coils in the MBP plates. The\nleakage magnetic field in the clamp plates, pull plates and so\non can be reduced with this arrangement.\nFig. 8 gives the field distribution on the outside surface of the\nHV coil. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the\ndirection magnetic\nflux density\n along the length direction of the up clamp plate.\nThe analyzed area is corresponding to a region of the C-phase\ncoil. Because the maximum magnetic flux density is 16.6 mT,\nwhich is less than the aforementioned criterion after installing\nthe MBP plates, there is no local overheating in the clamp plates.\nMeanwhile, the maximum loss density is reduced to 2.2 kW/m\n.\nThe calculated results of the magnetic flux density in the up\nclamp plate is observed to agree well with the test results. By\noptimizing the parameters of the MBP plate, such as a, b, c, d,\nand e in Fig. 1, the maximum loss density in the plates can be\nreduced by 94%. In this scheme, a\nmm, b\n mm,\nc\n mm, d\n mm, and e\n mm. Table III gives\na comparison of the loss density in the clamp plate from the\nmiddle to the end along the axial direction. The MBP plate is\neffective to reduce the losses of these parts to avoiding local\noverheating problem.\nIn computing the electromagnetic field of the MBP plates, the\nmaximum magnetic flux density is found to be 1.35 T and that\nis less than the saturation flux density. Moreover, the measured\nvalue is 1.23 T and this compares well with the computed one.\nThe eddy current loss in the MBP plate is small because they\nare made of silicon sheets. The design of the MBP plates is thus\nsuccessful. Fig. 10 gives the distribution of the magnetic field\nin the up MBP plate.\nAs the loss in the tank wall is high, a 4-mm-thick copper\nshield is used to alleviate the overheating problem in the tank\nFig. 10. Distribution of the magnetic field in the up MBP plate.\nFig. 11. Distribution of eddy current density in the tank wall.\nwall. The total losses in the copper shield and tank wall is then\nreduced by 80% as compared to that with an unshielded tank\nwall. Meanwhile, the maximum loss density is reduced from\n200 kW/m\nto 25 kW/m\n . Fig. 11 gives the distribution of the\neddy current density in the tank wall.\nIV . CONCLUSION\nThis paper presents a 3-D A-V-A coupled formulation in\nwhich the eddy current field and the electric circuit equations\nin a power transformer are solved simultaneously.\nBesides axial and radial forces, the torsional force acting on\nthe spiral coils is computed. By checking the mechanical robust-\nness and stability of the coil, one can evaluate whether the coils\ncan withstand the short-circuit forces.\nBy optimizing the magnetic bypass plate, the losses are\nreduced significantly, and hence, overheating in the clamping\nplates is avoided.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] Y .
