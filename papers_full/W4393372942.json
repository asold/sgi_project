Our results suggest that LLMs can be used for automated harmonization with a high\naccuracy that can potentially be improved in the future by applying domain-trained models.\nBACKGROUND\nWith the rapid growth of collected cohort studies in the \u0000eld of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly\nAlzheimer's and Parkinson’s disease, achieving data interoperability across cohorts has become a signi\u0000cant\nchallenge. Cohort studies typically employ their own naming conventions for collecting measurements and\ndo not adhere to a standard naming system.1 This leads to a very time-consuming data preprocessing step\nthat would be essential for data-driven analysis across cohorts. Moreover, the set of measurements collected\nin each cohort study often depends on the speci\u0000c research questions for which the study was designed.1,2\nAs a result, not all cohort studies focus on the same biomarkers or measurements. Given these challenges, it\nbecomes essential to create a Common Data Model (CDM) that considers the variable naming convention of\ncohorts and demonstrates the availability of the measurements on a granular variable level. To our\nknowledge, no CDM has been developed for Parkinson’s disease (PD) data, unlike Alzheimer’s disease (AD)\ndata, for which multiple CDMs have been previously constructed.3,4 Given the importance of data\ninteroperability for disease investigation through data-driven analysis, it is of utmost importance to construct\na PD CDM. Considering patient privacy and data sharing restrictions, the adoption of a CDM could\nsigni\u0000cantly accelerate research areas, particularly in the context of federated learning systems.5\nThe person responsible for harmonization, maintenance, and FAIRi\u0000cation6 of data in an organization is\ncommonly the position of the data steward.7 While such curation efforts are important and necessary, they\nconsume a considerable amount of time and resources. Automated3,8 or assisted9,10 data harmonization\ntherefore has been an ongoing topic of research to facilitate the data harmonization process and improve the\ne\u0000ciency, accuracy, and overall effectiveness of integrating diverse datasets from disparate sources. This\nultimately enables seamless collaboration and informed decision-making in various \u0000elds, such as healthcare\nand \u0000nance, and fosters scienti\u0000c cross-cohort research.\nPage 3/23\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and in particular Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models have\nshown promising results in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation,\ntranslation11, summarization12,13, question-answering14,15, and sentiment analysis16. They have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding context, generating coherent and contextually\nrelevant responses, and capturing intricate language patterns. While LLMs, and speci\u0000cally implementations\nlike ChatGPT, have already been proposed to support tasks such as data management17,18, documentation18–\n20, or decision \u0000nding21,22 in a clinical setting, no efforts have yet been made to utilize the capabilities of\nLLMs in a data harmonization or data stewardship use case. To \u0000ll this gap and evaluate the utility of LLMs to\npotentially revolutionize data harmonization as a whole, we employed a novel PD CDM and used it as a base\nto benchmark the performance of an automated mapping approach that utilizes LLM-based text embeddings.\nWe discuss the potential of automated harmonization approaches using LLMs and compare them with a\ncommonly used string matching based baseline approach to illustrate the potential merit of utilizing LLMs for\nautomated data harmonization.\nRESULTS\nTo institute a consistent structure across diverse cohort studies, developing a CDM could facilitate laying the\ngroundwork for data interoperability. We established a PD CDM containing a variable naming system for six\ncohorts, harmonized against the OMOP CDM and ontology terms, resulting in 741 unique reference terms.\nTogether with our previously established AD CDM1, we evaluated pairwise harmonizations of a total of 19\ndifferent cohorts in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.\nWe employed our CDMs to benchmark the performance of LLM embedding-based automatic harmonization,\nas well as a simple string matching based approach. We calculated embeddings using OpenAIs most recent\nembedding model API as well as MPNet in a local setting to compute similarities between cohort\ndescriptions for an automated harmonization work\u0000ow. A detailed description of our work\u0000ow is shown in\nFig. 5 in the method section. Our results suggest that automatic harmonization of cohort data can be\nachieved for both PD and AD cohort studies.\nPASSIONATE\nWe created PASSIONATE23 (PArkinSonS dIsease cOmmoN dATa modEl), a PD CDM comprising cross-\nmappings of six distinct cohorts. We enriched the variable mappings of PASSIONATE with the OMOP CDM\nand ontology terms wherever the terms were available. As a result, PASSIONATE comprised 741 unique terms\nharmonized across eight different sources. The number of included variables from each source\n(Supplementary Table S1 online) and the number of overlapping variable mappings between combinations of\ncohorts are reported in Fig. 1. Within PASSIONATE, the total number of variables stemming from each source\nvaried across cohorts. For instance, the total number of variables that were included from the LuxPARK\ncohort was 534, while only 61 variables of the OPDC cohort could be encompassed (Fig. 1). This was a result\nof certain cohorts collecting a higher number of variables in comparison to others.\nWe observed that certain cohorts shared a large number of variables, whereas in other cohorts, the opposite\nwas noted. Among the LuxPARK and PPMI cohorts, 231 variables could be semantically harmonized. LCC\nPage 4/23\nand OPDC had the smallest variable overlap with a total of 27 variables. The mapping overlap among sets\nwith three or more cohorts varied across different sets. One notable example of having the most common\nvariables was the overlap among LuxPARK, PPMI, and LCC with a total of 196 variables. Replacing one of\nthose cohorts with another decreased the number of common variables noticeably. For instance, LuxPARK,\nLCC, and OPDC had 31 common variables that were included in PASSIONATE, and similarly, LuxPARK, LCC,\nand PRoBaND had 36 variables. We made PASSIONATE publicly available at Zenodo\n(10.5281/zenodo.10218362).\nCohort harmonization\nWe evaluated whether utilizing LLM embeddings could accelerate and automatize the semantic\nharmonization of PD datasets. After manually creating semantic mappings for six cohort studies and de\u0000ning\na reference term, we utilized OpenAIs embedding API to create an embedding space for each variable's\ndescriptions. We additionally computed embeddings for a local variant LLM using MPNet24 as well as fuzzy\nstring matching for a baseline comparison. By performing semantic harmonization for each pair of cohorts, in\naddition to harmonizing each cohort against the reference terms of PASSIONATE, we calculated the accuracy\nof each mapping (Table 1). Our results revealed that in 27 out of 30 cases of pairwise cohort harmonization,\nour proposed approach based on OpenAI embeddings achieved an accuracy above 80%. Cohort-to-cohort\nharmonization using MPNet showed an accuracy of above 80% in 18 cases. In contrast, string matching only\nachieved an accuracy above 80% in seven cases. Similarly, when harmonizing each cohort against the\nreference terms of PASSIONATE (i.e., using their descriptions), using both OpenAI embeddings and MPNet\napproaches obtained a signi\u0000cantly higher accuracy than string matching for all cohorts. LuxPARK\ndemonstrated the highest string matching accuracy in harmonizing a cohort against the PASSIONATE\nreference terms, achieving 31%. Utilizing the MPNet method increased the accuracy to 62% while employing\nthe OpenAI embedding approach further boosted it to 66%.\nPage 5/23\nTable 1\nCalculated Accuracy of the highest similarity match using OpenAI embeddings, MPNet approach, and theclosest match using fuzzy string matching. The total number of variables that could have been included inthis analysis is reported in parentheses. Note: these numbers are based on the variables’ descriptionavailability and existence of the variable within PASSIONATE.\nMappingfrom /mappingto\nMethod OPDC\n(n = 30)\nPRoBaND\n(n = 43)\nBIOFIND\n(n = 121)\nLCC\n(n = 147)\nLuxPARK\n(n = 175)\nPPMI\n(n = 223)\nPASSIONATE\n(n = 271)\nOPDC Fuzzy - 75% 15% 18% 25% 7% 0%\nMPNet - 100% 77% 45% 56% 71% 52%\nOpenAIembeddings- 100% 92% 91% 81% 79% 52%\nPRoBaNDFuzzy 85% - 21% 17% 32% 25% 3%\nMPNet 100% - 79% 72% 77% 80% 51%\nOpenAIembeddings100% - 79% 83% 86% 75% 51%\nBIOFIND Fuzzy 46% 47% - 94% 70% 93% 19%\nMPNet 92% 84% - 98% 81% 98% 57%\nOpenAIembeddings92% 89% - 95% 87% 98% 68%\nLCC Fuzzy 45% 50% 93% - 68% 88% 22%\nMPNet 73% 83% 96% - 83% 94% 58%\nOpenAIembeddings82% 89% 97% - 89% 92% 64%\nLuxPARK Fuzzy 44% 50% 75% 73% - 69% 31%\nMPNet 81% 82% 72% 76% - 71% 62%\nOpenAIembeddings88% 82% 90% 88% - 85% 66%\nPPMI Fuzzy 57% 60% 95% 89% 65% - 27%\nMPNet 86% 90% 97% 97% 79% - 64%\nOpenAIembeddings86% 90% 100% 96% 85% - 74%\nWe performed the same investigation using the previously established CDM for AD cohorts (i.e., AD-\nMapper3). We conducted semantic harmonization of 13 distinct AD cohort studies once utilizing OpenAI and\nMPNet embeddings and fuzzy string matching as a baseline approach. The accuracies of all strategies are\npresented in Fig. 2 and the individual values are shown in Supplementary Tables S2-S4 online. Due to the\nvolume of results, individual comparison was impractical. Therefore, we implemented a ranking system to\nPage 6/23\nassess model accuracy, indicating superior performance within a comprehensive table (Supplementary Table\nS5 online). Similarly to the previous experiment, OpenAI and MPNet embeddings resulted in much higher\naccuracy than the string matching approach (Fig. 2). In 90 cases, GPT demonstrated superior accuracy,\nfollowed by MPNet in 43 cases (Supplementary Fig. S1 online). Additionally, in 30 cases, both OpenAI and\nMPNet embeddings exhibited equal accuracies, all surpassing the performance of string matching. The\nremaining 4 cases did not show a clear preference (i.e., equal accuracy), while in 2 cases, string matching and\nOpenAI outperformed the MPNet embeddings. Lastly, using string matching for variable harmonization\nshowed 0% accuracy in 11 cases (e.g. harmonizing ABVIB to ARWIBO).\nTo evaluate to which degree the consideration of lower-ranked matches can potentially improve the accuracy\nof a (semi)-automated mapping, we inspected the k-nearest neighbors in terms of their highest cosine\nsimilarity up to a maximum rank of 20. We chose to evaluate the mapping from both PPMI and LuxPARK to\nour novel PASSIONATE CDM, as both contained the most variables out of all 6 evaluated PD cohorts and the\nautomatic mapping (c.f. Table 1) had the lowest accuracy when mapping to PASSIONATE. The results from\nthis enrichment approach are shown in Fig. 3.\nFor the mapping from PPMI to PASSIONATE (Fig. 3 (a)), we noticed that by considering each second closest\nneighbor, the overall accuracy improved for the embedding-based matching by over ten percent from 74–\n85%. When considering additional matches, the accuracy could be further improved up to 97% for a\nconsidered rank of 17, while it did not improve any further in our evaluation of a rank up to 20. While we\nobserved a similar increase in accuracy for the fuzzy string matching approach, the increase in accuracy was\nlower and capped earlier to a maximum of 29% at a rank of 17. Similarly, the embeddings based on the\nMPNet model also outperformed fuzzy string matching by a large margin, while mappings based on OpenAI\nembeddings still performed signi\u0000cantly better for most ranks, particularly for lower-ranking neighborhoods.\nWe found a similar result for the mapping of LuxPARK to PPMI (Fig. 3 (b)), where for the embedding-based\nmapping, considering the second closest match improved the accuracy from 66–75%, capping out at 94% at\nrank 16. The MPNet embeddings again performed similarly well with a starting accuracy of 62% at rank 1,\ncapping out at 93% at rank 19. The fuzzy string matching results also improved similarly to the mapping from\nPPMI, capping out at an accuracy of 26% at rank 16.\nClustering of cohort variable descriptions\nWe utilized t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to illustrate the embeddings of variable\ndescriptions across all examined cohorts. Figure 4 (a) shows the distribution of the embeddings computed\nfrom all available PD cohort variable descriptions (blue) versus the distribution of all available AD cohort\ndescriptions (red). As expected, we observed the formation of clusters within each disease’s variable\ndescriptions as well as distinct clusters within each disease. However, we noticed a signi\u0000cant overlap in\nvariable descriptions between both disease types, as depicted in the central cluster in Fig. 4 (a).\nIn the second visualization Fig. 4 (b), we color-coded each embedding according to their cohort origin,\nregardless of their association with AD or PD. We found again that some variable clusters are cohort-speci\u0000c\n(e.g. the two top side clusters belonging to DOD-ADNI), while others are formed by a mixture of different\ncohorts. We host an interactive version of Fig. 4 (b) (tsnepad.scai.fraunhofer.de), enabling users to toggle the\nPage 7/23\nvisibility of speci\u0000c cohorts and view the underlying variable description by hovering the mouse over the\ncorresponding data point.\nDISCUSSION\nThe semantic harmonization of six PD cohort studies through manual curation revealed two major aspects.\nHeterogeneity was observed regarding the granularity of variables within these cohorts. Different cohorts\ncollected speci\u0000c sets of variables, which were not always common across the investigated cohorts. This\nwas not surprising, as cohort studies often collected measurements based on the goals of their studies.2\nHowever, as such cohorts are often the basis for data-driven analysis, it was vital to investigate the variable\noverlap to determine potential cohorts that could be used as training and validating datasets.25 For instance,\namong the variable mappings done within PASSIONATE, LCC, and OPDC, cohorts shared 37 variables. The\nnaming conventions and the way that measurements were reported among investigated datasets differed\nsubstantially in most cases, except for PPMI and BIOFIND. This difference resulted from cohort studies often\nemploying their naming conventions for collecting measurements. Although similarities were observed\namong certain variables (e.g., the variable “gender” in LCC, PRoBaND, and OPDC), that was not the case for\nthe majority of variables. Nevertheless, by generating PASSIONATE, we emphasized the signi\u0000cance of a\nCDM in light of the limitations inherent in cohort studies. Such CDM could prove bene\u0000cial, particularly when\nemployed for data-driven analyses and investigations using federated learning.\nWe conducted semantic harmonization of AD and PD cohorts' variables by analyzing the similarities in the\nembeddings of variable descriptions generated using OpenAI and MPNet embeddings in addition to the string\nmatching approach. The results of our experiment indicated that OpenAI-based embeddings yielded the\nhighest accuracy, followed by the MPNet approach, with the string matching method being the least accurate.\nIn pairwise mappings for AD cohorts, although the accuracies based on OpenAI and MPNet were signi\u0000cantly\nhigher than string matching, they achieved an accuracy above 80% in only 38 and 32 out of 156 cases. String\nmatching, on the other hand, achieved an accuracy above 80% in only 16 cases. This could be the result of AD\ncohorts’ descriptions not being su\u0000ciently descriptive. For instance, in the I-ADNI cohort, the cohort's\ndictionary lacked information on all available variables, and the descriptions were not informative.\nThe harmonization of each PD cohort against PASSIONATE exhibited the lowest accuracy for all approaches,\nexcept for one case where MPNet was used to harmonize OPDC to LCC. This could potentially be the result of\ndissimilarities between PASSIONATE descriptions and the description of variables in each cohort, given that\nPASSIONATE descriptions were extracted from ontologies. While harmonizing the AD cohort to the AD-\nMapper variables, the accuracies varied and were not consistently the lowest. Nevertheless, utilizing OpenAI\nembeddings demonstrated a substantially higher accuracy than fuzzy string matching, with MPNet emerging\nas the second-best option. The accuracies we computed in Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S2-S4 online\nare non-symmetric for most pairwise mappings. This is due to the fact that the CDMs contained upper-level\nconcepts for several of the evaluated cohorts. As a result, one cohort mapping may have higher accuracies\ndue to correct matches to the upper-level concept in the other, while in the reversed matching case such an\nupper-level concept may not be present. For more details refer to the supplementary material online\n(Accuracy: A to B vs. B to A).\nPage 8/23\nBased on the results shown in Fig. 3, it is apparent that even though the automated OpenAI-based mapping\nresults perform notably well with an accuracy of over 80% for most of the pairwise PD mappings, considering\nlower-ranked matches can further enhance the harmonization accuracy by a considerable amount. Given that\nthe inclusion of the second match already improves performance by over ten percent and the total accuracy\ncan be enhanced to 97% when considering up to 17 closest matches, the merit of this approach becomes\nvery apparent. Data Harmonization is often approached in a semi-automatic process, where the Data Steward\nwill actively orchestrate curation with the support of Data-Stewardship Tools (DST)9,10. One way to take\nadvantage of a higher mapping accuracy of several close OpenAI embedding matches would be to provide\nthe Data Steward with a list of optimal suggestions for mapping. It could also be possible to threshold the\nlength of such a list based on the maximum allowed embedding distance. This would ensure that the Data\nSteward receives the most optimal and relevant number of recommendations without introducing an\noverhead of too many suggestions for manual curation.\nThe matching of embeddings can inherently be seen as a clustering task. Variables with a small semantic\nembedding distance from each other form semantic clusters when they describe a common concept. The\nprojection of variable description embeddings revealed signi\u0000cant overlap between AD and PD cohorts (Fig. 4\n(a)), with clusters emerging across various modalities, indicating similarities in variable space. However,\ndistinct clusters formed within each disease type, suggesting semantic dissimilarity, likely due to variations in\ndata collection across cohorts. For instance, MRI measurements were not included in the six PD cohort\nstudies analyzed. Additionally, encoding description embeddings with cohort origin (color-coded) revealed\nmixed clusters, indicating potential harmonization opportunities. Variables with similar descriptions were\nclosely located, suggesting harmonization potential within CDMs and associated cohorts.\nOne major limitation of our approach was the requirement for descriptions (e.g., in the form of data\ndictionaries) to compute \u0000tting mapping candidates. As the information solely present in variable names was\nvery limited, we found it unsuitable as a basis for any informative harmonization approach in most cases.\nConsequently, variables that did not provide descriptions could not be harmonized, leading to their exclusion\nfrom our evaluation. In the AD use case, we were obliged to exclude several cohorts that did not provide\ndescriptive information or offered supplementary data (i.e., a data dictionary) in a format that was\nirretrievable, such as having ambiguous Unicode encodings due to different language formats. We do,\nhowever, expect our OpenAI-based mapping approach to potentially harmonize cohorts with data dictionaries\nin different languages with a similar performance as demonstrated in this paper. This assumption still needs\nvalidation and is part of our current research. While we could potentially harmonize variables based on their\ndescriptions, our harmonization approach is meant to rely on a baseline of pre-curated data. Without a\nbaseline model in the form of a CDM or a curated terminology, even though variables could be mapped\nagainst each other, their mapping validity would be hard to assess. Lastly, the PASSIONATE CDM is limited to\nvariables collected in the investigated PD cohorts and, as such, does not represent the entire PD variable\nlandscape.\nCONCLUSION\nGiven that cohort data harmonization is essential and continues to be an area of ongoing research, and\nconsidering that cohort studies often serve as the foundation for data-driven analysis, we developed\nPage 9/23\nPASSIONATE, a PD CDM, and have made it publicly available. By leveraging PASSIONATE and a previously\nestablished AD CDM, we assessed the feasibility of automated variable harmonization across cohorts. We\nfound that LLM-based mapping approaches outperform string matching by a large margin for the majority of\ntested cohort use cases. Our study represents a signi\u0000cant milestone in demonstrating the transformative\npotential of LLMs, particularly when adapted and re-trained for domain-speci\u0000c tasks. By showcasing the\nremarkable performance of general-purpose GPT models, even in complex \u0000elds like neurodegenerative\ndiseases, our \u0000ndings underscore the imminent arrival of a new era in data stewardship. We foresee\nsigni\u0000cant advancements in the near future, where the strategic use of LLMs is expected to drive notable\nimprovements in data curation and harmonization practices.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nEvaluated PD datasets\nTo establish a consistent structure across diverse cohort studies, developing a CDM could facilitate laying\nthe groundwork for data interoperability. Given that a PD CDM has not been constructed to date, we collected\ndata dictionaries from six distinct PD cohort studies to create a PD CDM. We manually compared the\nvariables collected in each cohort (Table 2) and established a mapping for variables common across a\nminimum of two cohorts through manual curation. We continued this procedure until all common variables\nwere mapped across all cohorts. We created a reference term for each variable based on how variables were\ncommonly described in the literature. In addition, we semantically harmonized the mappings of all cohorts\nagainst the terms of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)26 CDM and mapped them to\nontologies that provided respective semantic context, where applicable. We included descriptions for each\nreference term by extracting from ontology descriptions or obtained through an extensive literature search\nusing standard search engines, including Google Scholar. Lastly, we populated the mapping space of our\nCDM by including additional variables from each cohort, guided by literature \u0000ndings and focusing on variable\nimportance. We deliberately excluded certain site-speci\u0000c variables (e.g., assessment date, site number) and\ninstead focused on including biomarkers that were both collected and of interest for data-driven disease\ninvestigation. The rationale behind our decision for the inclusion and exclusion of cohort variables was based\non those containing measurements rather than indicating whether a test was performed (i.e., yes or no).\nPage 10/23\nTable 2\nUnderlying sources that were used to generate the PD CDM.\nVariable Source Consortium\nCohort BIOFIND27 The Fox Investigation for New Discovery of Biomarkers in Parkinson'sDisease\nLCC28 LRRK2 Cohort Consortium\nLuxPARK29 The Luxembourg Parkinson's Study\nOPDC30 Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre Discovery Cohort\nPPMI31 Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative\nPRoBaND32 Tracking Parkinson's\nCDM OMOP26 The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership\nOther ReferenceTerm -\nOntology33 -\nWe mapped variables that were semantically equivalent across cohorts. Due to the common practice in\ncohort studies of reporting variables in different ways (e.g., the biological sex of participants: Female, F, 0),\nwe considered these variables as a match. This was done despite the variations in how the variable was\nrecorded, as long as comparability could be achieved with minimal preprocessing steps.\nInvestigated AD datasets\nTo assess whether the semantic harmonization of cohort studies using OpenAI and MPNet embeddings is\nlimited to PD datasets or can be applied to other diseases, we expanded our investigation to include AD\ndatasets. We utilized the previously established AD CDM (i.e., AD-Mapper3) for this analysis. We selected 13\ncohorts that were included in the AD-Mapper CDM based on the availability and usability of their data\ndictionaries (Supplementary Table S6, Fig. S3 online). Using the data dictionary of each cohort, we performed\nthe semantic harmonization of the cohort's variables to the reference terms of the AD-Mapper CDM by\napplying the harmonization work\u0000ow and methods which we elaborate on in the following sections.\nHarmonization work\u0000ow\nTo evaluate the potential merit of an automated harmonization approach based on LLM embeddings, we\nevaluated two different harmonization strategies using embedding similarity as well as a simple string-\nmatching comparison as a baseline approach. We assessed all strategies by harmonizing each cohort from\nour novel PD CDM as well as a pre-existing CDM in the context of AD. As variable names alone were often not\nself-explainable and did not contain enough information to su\u0000ciently describe the semantics of\nmeasurements, we instead utilized the variable descriptions that were provided in the data dictionaries of\neach cohort. For the LCC cohort, we parsed the dictionary tables from the PDF and converted them into CSV\nformat. To prepare a ground truth based on the CDM for later evaluation of computed mappings, we matched\nPage 11/23\neach description from each dictionary to the corresponding variable name in the CDM. We were only able to\nevaluate variables of each cohort where the descriptions were available in the data dictionary, since they were\nneeded for both string-matching and the computation of a description embedding.\nMapping evaluation methods\nAs for the \u0000rst strategy, we evaluated the accuracy of harmonization matches of each pair of cohorts, both\nwithin PD and AD, based on the cosine similarity of each available variable description. An exemplary\nwork\u0000ow for pairwise harmonization is shown in Fig. 5.\nIn the \u0000rst step, variable names and descriptions were extracted from each data dictionary and a high\ndimensional embedding is computed based on each variable description. The embeddings were retrieved\nfrom the OpenAI embeddings API for their most recent (text-embedding-3-large) embedding model.34 The\nMPNet embeddings were calculated locally using the all-mpnet-base-v2 model hosted at huggingface. We\nchose MPNet over an older architecture like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n(BERT), since it has been shown to outperform BERT by a large margin. Using the computed embeddings,\neach variable from the source cohort A can be mapped to a single variable in the target cohort B based on the\ncontextual similarity of their variable descriptions. As a measure of similarity, we calculated a cosine\nsimilarity matrix containing the similarities of each variable description from cohort A to each possible\ndescription match in cohort B. We then matched each variable in cohort A to the corresponding variable with\nthe highest possible similarity in cohort B. Based on the concept labels in the CDM that are provided for all\nvariables for both cohorts, we could then check for equality of the concept labels and assess whether the\ncalculated match was correct or not.\nTo have a baseline comparison to a more conventional approach, we also computed the closest description\nmatches using fuzzy string matching. The implementation used the calculated Levenshtein distance35,36 to\nrank the description strings based on their single-letter edit distance. The accuracy for both the embedding\nsimilarity match and the string matching approach for each pair of PD cohorts can be found in Table 1.\nWhile in the best case, the correct match should also be the closest in terms of description distance, it may\nbe useful to also consider the n closest matches instead. This especially applies if we consider a semi-\nautomated harmonization approach, where a data steward has the option to choose a match from a list of\npotential candidates. To evaluate this matching strategy, we computed embedding similarities and\nLevenshtein distances as in the closest match scenario and ranked the 20 best matches by their lowest\ncomputed distances. The results for 2 pairwise mappings can be found in Fig. 3.\nEmbedding visualizations\nTo further evaluate which variable descriptions get matched and clustered based on their embedding\nproximities, we used t-SNE37 to compute a two-dimensional representation of each available description\nembedding for all AD and PD cohorts. We created two plots, one visualizing all available data points color-\ncoded to their a\u0000liation to AD and PD, and the other visualizing their a\u0000liation to their respective cohort\nthrough a color-coded label. The two resulting plots are shown in Fig. 4.\nABBREVIATIONS\nPage 12/23\nA4: Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Disease\nABVIB: Aging Brain: Vasculature, Ischemia, and Behavior\nAD: Alzheimer’s Disease\nADNI: The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\nAIBL: The Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing\nARWIBO: Alzheimer’s Disease Repository Without Borders\nBIOFIND: The Fox Investigation for New Discovery of Biomarkers in Parkinson's Disease\nCDM: Common Data Model\nDOD-ADNI: Effects of TBI & PTSD on Alzheimer’s Disease in Vietnam Vets\nDST: Data Stewardship Tool\nEDSD: The European DTI Study on Dementia\nEMIF: European Medical Information Framework\nGPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer\nI-ADNI: The Italian Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\nJADNI: Japanese Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\nLCC: LRRK2 Cohort Consortium\nLLM: Large Language Model\nLuxPARK: The Luxembourg Parkinson's Study\nMRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nNLP: Natural Language Processing\nOMOP: Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership\nOPDC: Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre Discovery Cohort\nPASSIONATE: PArkinSonS dIsease cOmmoN dATa modEl\nPD: Parkinson’s Disease\nPharmaCog: Prediction of Cognitive Properties of New Drug Candidates for Neurodegenerative Diseases in\nEarly Clinical Development\nPage 13/23\nPPMI: Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative\nPREVENT-AD: Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease\nPRoBaND: Tracking Parkinson's\nt-SNE: t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding\nVITA: Vienna Transdanube Aging\nDECLARATIONS\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe wish to extend our gratitude to all data owners for their dedication to the principles of open science,\ndemonstrated by their willingness to share their data.\nThe A4 Study is a secondary prevention trial in preclinical Alzheimer's disease, aiming to slow cognitive\ndecline associated with brain amyloid accumulation in clinically normal older individuals.

The \u0000rst plot (a) shows the distribution between AD and PD variable descriptions, and the second\nplot (b) the distribution of each cohort. While some cohort variables form homogeneous clusters for their\ncohort-speci\u0000c descriptions, other clusters are comprised of variable descriptions from different cohorts with\nthe same underlying semantics. The same analysis has been done using MPNet embeddings and can be\nseen in Supplementary Figure S2 Online.\nPage 23/23\nFigure 5\nExemplary work\u0000ow for an automatic pairwise harmonization and match evaluation of two different cohorts.\nVariable descriptions are extracted from the corresponding data dictionaries and embedding vectors are\ncomputed via OpenAI API. The vectors are matched based on their smallest distance and the resulting\nmatches are evaluated based on the underlying CDM variable mappings.\nSupplementary Files\nThis is a list of supplementary \u0000les associated with this preprint.
