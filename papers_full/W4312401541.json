Misinformation\nis prevalent on social networking platforms and is often seen\nin product advertising. Since early 2020, the COVID-19\npandemic has offered a new medical condition for advertisers\nand sellers to exploit, who seek to profit from the crisis at the\nexpense of public health [2].\nAlthough some misleading posts regarding COVID-19 have\nbeen about the virus’s origins or the effectiveness and safety of\nmasks and vaccines [3-5], others have focused on false\ninformation about alternative products in treating or preventing\nCOVID-19. For example, since the onset of the pandemic, some\ncannabidiol (CBD) sellers have claimed that CBD can prevent\nor cure COVID-19 (Figure 1). Preclinical studies have suggested\nthat CBD could be effective in treating respiratory conditions\nand might confer cardioprotective, nephroprotective,\nhepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and anticonvulsant benefits\n[6]. Meanwhile, other evidence suggests that CBD could\ndecrease one’s ability to fight infections, countering its potential\nclinical use as an anti-inflammatory agent [7]. Because CBD\nhas not been thoroughly tested for efficacy and safety in treating\nCOVID-19, its benefits are mostly considered unsubstantiated\n[8]. However, there is plentiful web-based marketing for CBD,\ntouting these unverified benefits. This is not unique to CBD\nand COVID-19 and occurs with other loosely regulated\nsubstances (eg, kratom and herbal supplements) as well as other\nmedical conditions such as Alzheimer disease, cancer, and\nautism. Although the consumption of CBD is typically well\ntolerated, misinformation about its effectiveness in treating\nCOVID-19 has become widespread and poses a danger to public\nhealth [9,10]. Therefore, it is essential that this type of content\nbe efficiently identified so that its potential harmful effects on\npublic health can be minimized.\nFigure 1. Example of a tweet promoting cannabidiol (CBD) as a prevention or treatment for COVID-19.\nMisinformation has been shown to spread faster and further\nthan accurate information on social media, and Twitter serves\nas an example of a social media site where misinformation about\nsmoking products, drugs, vaccines, and diseases is abound\n[11,12]. Specifically regarding COVID-19, for example, in\nMarch 2020, a daily average of 46,000 misleading or inaccurate\nnews posts appeared on Twitter in Italy alone [13]. In Iran, a\nrumor originating on social networks claimed that ingesting\nneat alcohol could cure COVID-19, resulting in hundreds of\nalcohol poisoning deaths [14]. Furthermore, influential Twitter\nusers such as former President Donald J Trump and celebrity\nJoe Rogan suggested taking the antimalarial medications\nchloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, even\nthough there has never been scientific evidence to support these\nclaims [15-17]. Although the United States FDA warned against\nimproper consumption of these substances in July 2020, there\nwere still dozens of documented deaths and poisonings\nassociated with their use, including at least one person who\ningested fish tank cleaner containing chloroquine after being\ninfluenced by misinformation on Twitter [18-20]. Not only has\nmisinformation dissuaded consumers from seeking effective\ntreatments but also it has encouraged the use of dangerous and\nunfounded treatments.\nPrior research has shown some success in using supervised and\nunsupervised machine learning techniques to detect and explore\nCOVID-19 misinformation on social media platforms such as\nJMIR Infodemiology 2023 | vol. 3 | e38390 | p. 2https://infodemiology.jmir.org/2023/1/e38390\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTurner et alJMIR INFODEMIOLOGY\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nTwitter [21-24] and YouTube [25]. Although some studies used\nan annotated data approach [21,24,26], it was noted that the\nrigor and costs of this process could preclude its widespread\nutility [21]. One study used an unsupervised topic model to\nexamine inaccurate information about vaping CBD and\nCOVID-19 [27], which is a more cost-effective technique than\nannotation, but is a less explicit way to identify misinformation\nthan supervised approaches. Deep learning [23,28] and\ntransformer language models [22,23,25,29] are the most\ncommonly used techniques, likely because of their efficiency\nand highly advanced ability to interpret and understand natural\nlanguage, which is key to examining content on social media.\nThis study leverages the expertise of the FDA, the regulatory\nbody of the safety and efficacy of numerous products intended\nfor human or animal use in the United States, to define\nmisinformation regarding CBD and COVID-19 using Warning\nLetters as a gold standard. When the FDA becomes aware that\na company has violated FDA regulations, they often issue\nWarning Letters to the company that outline the nature of the\nviolation (eg, problems with claims about a product and\nincorrect directions for use), corrective action, and a timeframe\n[30]. The FDA then follows up to verify whether the company\nhas completed the corrective action, and if not, the FDA may\nenact regulatory actions such as seizure or civil penalties [31].\nThese Warning Letters are made available to the public on the\nFDA’s website [32]. By using verbatim quotes taken from\nrelevant FDA Warning Letters and transformer language models,\nwe propose an efficient and consistent approach to identify\ntweets that contain false claims regarding CBD and COVID-19.\nObjectives\nThis study has two primary objectives: (1) to examine\nmisinformation concerning CBD and COVID-19 disseminated\nby Twitter advertisers and (2) to propose a framework that helps\nidentify CBD- and COVID-19–related misinformation in tweets\nmore efficiently and can also be easily modified to detect\nmisinformation in advertisements about other substances and\nconditions.\nTraditional text classification requires labeled data for model\ntraining and testing, which can be both time consuming and\nexpensive. Transformer-based language models have shown\npromising results in various semantic textual similarity tasks,\nincluding in the medical domain [33].\nMethods\nEthics Approval\nThis study leverages publicly available data and was registered\nas approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Review\nBoard (approval protocol 20.1122).\nCollecting and Annotating Tweets\nWe used the Snscrape Python package to collect English\nlanguage tweets from the Twitter website from January 1, 2020,\nto April 28, 2021, by searching for tweets using the following\nkeywords: CBD or cannabidiol, and COVID-19, COVID, corona\n[34]. Although this method does not provide full access to\nTwitter’s past data, it does afford the ability to collect thousands\nof historical tweets retrospectively after an unexpected event\nhas occurred, such as the pandemic. Using this method of\nhistorical tweet searching, we were able to collect 37,526 tweets\nover a 484-day period.\nTo extract the commercial CBD tweets referencing COVID-19,\nwe used a model previously developed by our group [35]. The\nmodel was trained on an earlier collection of CBD tweets to\nidentify those that reflected commercial sales, promotion, and\nmarketing of CBD. Applying the commercial CBD tweet\nclassifier to the historical tweet collection resulted in 4937\ntweets that were classified as commercial CBD tweets\nreferencing COVID-19. We evaluated the performance of this\nmodel that identified commercial CBD tweets from the CBD\nor COVID-19 collection of tweets by annotating a random\nsample of classified 250 commercial CBD or COVID-19 tweets\nand 250 noncommercial CBD or COVID-19 tweets. We\nobserved an improvement in the commercial tweet classification\nperformance, with precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-scores of\n0.95 (Table 1).\nTable 1. Performance of 2019 commercial cannabidiol (CBD) classifier in differentiating tweets from 2020 to 2021 (N=500).a\nRandom sampleF1-scoreRecallPrecision\n2490.950.950.95Noncommercial CBD\n2510.950.950.95Commercial CBD\naAccuracy of the model: 0.95.\nThe United States FDA has warned CBD advertisers and sellers\nabout promoting CBD as a treatment or cure for several\nconditions, including COVID-19. These Warning Letters inform\nthe advertiser that CBD is not an approved treatment or\nprevention for the condition that the advertiser mentions, warn\nthe advertiser that further action will be taken if this style of\nmisleading advertising continues, and include the exact\nmisleading quote taken from the advertisement. This list of\nletters continues to grow as the FDA becomes aware of more\nadvertisers making false claims about the medical benefits of\nCBD. We drew directly from the FDA Warning Letters about\nCBD and COVID-19 to understand the types of statements that\nthe FDA had flagged as misinformation.\nWe used the statements from these FDA Warning Letters to\nidentify and label the CBD tweets containing COVID-19–related\nmisinformation. Instead of using our annotated set of tweets to\ntrain and test a tweet classification model, we used them to\nestablish the relationship of text similarity between the\nmisinformation tweets and the statements in the FDA Warning\nLetters via the transformer language model. The transformer\nJMIR Infodemiology 2023 | vol. 3 | e38390 | p. 3https://infodemiology.jmir.org/2023/1/e38390\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTurner et alJMIR INFODEMIOLOGY\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\narchitecture was introduced to address some of the shortcomings\nof the recurrent neural networks in tasks such as language\ntranslation [36].\nBecause the FDA’s CBD or COVID-19 Warning Letters did\nnot include CBD-infused hand sanitizers, we included the\nWarning Letters sent to advertisers of nonalcohol and essential\noil sanitizer products that had made false claims as guidance in\nour misinformation annotation process [37-43]. Figure 2 is an\nexample of one of the Warning Letters issued by the FDA about\nmisinformation surrounding the use of CBD for treating\nCOVID-19.\nThe extracted commercial CBD or COVID-19 tweets were\nannotated for misinformation (yes or no), according to the\nFDA’s definition of misinformation, by 3 university-trained,\nnonmedical, professional annotators; discrepancies were decided\nby a majority vote to determine the overall label of the tweet.\nBefore labeling the tweets, we reviewed several FDA Warning\nLetters with the annotators so that the annotators were familiar\nwith what the FDA considered a misleading statement. Because\ntweets are relatively short in length, if a tweet contained any\nmisinformation related to CBD and COVID-19, the entire tweet\nwas considered positive for misinformation. There were no\nnoticeable discrepancies among the annotators, and they had\nan intercoder agreement of 91%.\nThe Warning Letters on the FDA website provided some of the\nquotes that sellers used in their advertisements that the FDA\ndeemed misleading. Some examples of these letters are listed\nin Textbox 1. Along with the FDA’s definition of\nmisinformation, these quotes provided guidelines for annotating\nthe collection of tweets as to whether they contained\nmisinformation. Textbox 2 displays selected examples of the\nnonmisinformation and misinformation tweets encountered\nduring the annotation process.\nFigure 2.

CBD was also shown to reduce interleukin (IL)-2, IL-1α\nand β, interferon gamma, inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, and tumor necrosis\nfactor-α – all of which are associated with the pathology of severe cases of COVID-19.

The BERT model is trained on the\nnatural language processing tasks of masked language modeling\non English Wikipedia and the Brown Corpus texts and it predicts\nthe missing word in a sentence and performs next-sentence\nprediction. Masked language modeling allows the BERT model\nto understand the relationships between words, whereas\nnext-sentence prediction allows the BERT model to understand\nthe relationships between sentences.\nIn this study, we used a transformer language model to encode\neach of the commercial CBD tweets that we collected.\nSpecifically, we used the Sentence-T5 model because it is a\nstate-of-the-art language model that has outperformed other\nmodels in semantic textual similarity [45]. We also computed\nthe encoding for each statement containing misinformation\ntaken from the FDA website into vectors of size 768. We then\ncalculated the cosine similarity (Equation 1) between the\nencoding vectors of tweets (A) and the encoding vectors of the\nmisinformation quotes taken from the FDA Warning Letters\n(B).\nJMIR Infodemiology 2023 | vol. 3 | e38390 | p. 5https://infodemiology.jmir.org/2023/1/e38390\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTurner et alJMIR INFODEMIOLOGY\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nFigure 3 provides a theoretical illustration of how we isolated\ntweets that made false claims using the quotes taken from the\nFDA Warning Letters to find contextual similarities using cosine\nsimilarity. This example shows that when the tweets and quotes\nfrom Warning Letters are encoded into vectors, tweets\ncontaining CBD or COVID-19 misinformation will be closer\nin cosine distance to the FDA quotes than tweets without similar\nfalse claims about CBD and COVID-19. Using cosine similarity\nas the distance of similarity, we expected that the shortest cosine\ndistances would contain more misinformation, that is, tweets\nthat were contextually similar to the FDA’s samples.\nConversely, we expected the tweets with the longest cosine\ndistances to contain less misinformation. Using these points,\nwe identified a threshold at which we could confidently identify\nsets of tweets that mostly contained misinformation because of\ntheir semantic similarity to an established example of\nmisinformation. The optimal threshold should be the point at\nwhich the maximum number of tweets deemed as\nmisinformation is captured while minimizing the number of\nfalse positives (ie, tweets that do not contain misinformation)\nbeing captured.\nFigure 3. Representation of contextual similarity between cannabidiol (CBD) tweets and quotes from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Warning\nLetters.\nResults\nAnalysis of Misinformation\nAfter annotating the tweets for misinformation, we observed\nthat approximately 19% (938/4937) of the tweets contained\nmisinformation related to both CBD and COVID-19. Table 2\nshows some of the terms most frequently associated with CBD\nor COVID-19 misinformation. Aside from CBD-related terms,\nterms such as “help,” “boost,” “health,” “virus,” “sanitizer,”\nand “immune system” were among the most frequently\noccurring terms. We observed an increase in CBD or COVID-19\nconversations beginning in February 2020.

However, if the cosine distance was too small, few\nto no misinformation tweets were captured, and not all FDA\nstatements performed equally in capturing misinformation\ntweets.\nWe also examined the top 5 FDA statements that captured large\namounts of misinformation with high precision (Textbox 3).\nFigures 7-9 are equivalent to Figures 4-6 but include only the\nstatements displayed in Textbox 3. From these figures, we can\nsee that at a cosine distance between 0.10 and 0.13, we were\nable to capture between 21.9% (206/938) and 28.9% (272/938)\nof the misinformation tweets with a precision of above 80%.\nSpecifically, statement 8 was able to capture 34.4% (323/938)\nof tweets at a cosine distance of 0.105, and 84.8% (274/938) of\nthese tweets were labeled as misinformation. The 274 captured\ntweets represented 29.2% of the 938 misinformation in our data\nset.\nFigure 4. Cosine distance versus proportion of misinformation tweets captured.\nFigure 5.

CBD was also shown to reduce interleukin\n(IL)-2, IL-1α and β, interferon gamma, inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α,\nand tumor necrosis factor-α – all of which are associated with the pathology of severe cases of COVID-19. In addition to reducing these\npro-inflammatory cytokines, CBD has also been shown to increase the production of interferons, a type of signaling protein that activates\nimmune cells and prevents viruses from replicating”\n• Statement 8\n• “DML CBD: Immune Boost Pack...

Those consuming this misinformation may have\nmisconceptions about how the virus is transmitted, disease\nsymptoms, or health effects; they may communicate\nmisinformation to others who subsequently spread it and put\nthemselves and others at risk. Although there have been some\npreliminary studies on the benefits of cannabis in treating the\nsymptoms of COVID-19, findings are uncertain, and at the time\nof this writing, cannabis is not an approved treatment by the\nFDA [47]. Therefore, claiming that CBD products can\nunequivocally treat or prevent COVID-19 is a federal violation\nin the United States, where the FDA has made numerous\nattempts to warn web-based retailers making false claims about\ntheir products [1]. Our study demonstrates how FDA Warning\nLetters can be used with transformer language models to identify\ntweets containing misinformation that are semantically similar\nto Warning Letters. Our approach reduces the time, labor, and\npotential monetary costs of other text classification methods.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to use FDA Warning\nLetters as a foundation for identifying misinformation,\nparticularly as it relates to CBD and COVID-19, in web-based\nsocial networks.\nTransformer language models, such as the one used herein, are\npowerful tools that have been used for a number of purposes,\nsuch as translation [48,49] and text classification [50,51], and\nhave even been used to generate descriptions of images in text\n[52]. Because of their ability to understand and summarize\nnatural language, several studies have used these models to\nidentify web-based misinformation, which often includes\nnuanced language and requires techniques that recognize not\nonly semantic but also contextual similarities. Kumar et al [22]\nused Twitter to build a multilabel tweet classifier system in their\nstudy using a RoBERTa-large transformer language model to\nidentify COVID-19–related misinformation. Their model could\nidentify 4 classes: irrelevant, conspiracy, true information, and\nfalse information, and it achieved an F1-score of 76%. Although\nthis study focused on any class of misinformation that was\nidentified in the FDA Warning Letters, future studies could\nfurther classify the letters by type and evaluate the accuracy of\nour approach.\nAlthough this work was built on only Twitter platform, it is\npossible that it could also be applied to other social network\nplatforms. Serrano et al [25] used transformer-based language\nmodels to identify YouTube videos containing\nCOVID-19–related misinformation via comments posted on\nthe videos. They built a text classifier to identify\nconspiracy-related content and concluded that YouTube videos\ncontaining misinformation were accompanied by user comments\nwith a high percentage of conspiracy-related content [25]. Future\nstudies can assess the performance of our method on other\nplatforms.\nIn a recent approach to concept drift (changes in data and\nmeaning over time) in Twitter data streams, Bechini et al [53]\ntrained a semantic-based classifier using the BERT language\nmodel to examine the change in opinions about vaccines within\na corpus of Italian tweets; this model outperformed other\nstrategies, such as retraining the ensemble approaches. This\nsuggests that transformer-based models, such as the one\ndescribed herein, for identifying commercial tweets can be\nresilient over time. In addition, given more extensive (eg,\n“firehose” access) and future access to Twitter data, our\nmisinformation tweet classifier could identify newer and current\ntweets that were not included in our data set, as well as identify\ntweets making similar violations in near real time. Furthermore,\nas previously noted, this technology can be applied to other\nforms of misinformation that threaten public health and safety.\nOur approach to identifying tweets that make false claims about\nCBD and COVID-19 used quotes extracted from FDA Warning\nLetters to identify tweets that are semantically and contextually\nsimilar based on the cosine distance of sentence vectors.\nCompared with the approaches that require a large amount of\ndata annotation, this substantially reduces the time required to\nidentify the tweets making false health-related claims and flag\nJMIR Infodemiology 2023 | vol. 3 | e38390 | p. 12https://infodemiology.jmir.org/2023/1/e38390\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTurner et alJMIR INFODEMIOLOGY\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nthem with a high amount of confidence. This is attributed to 2\nfactors: we used minimal manually annotated data for validation\npurposes and we used a simple calculation of cosine similarity\nbetween tweets and quotes.\nOur study not only illustrates the scope of misleading\ninformation about CBD and COVID-19 in particular but also\ndemonstrates an efficient and affordable approach to identifying\nother instances of this widespread problem—an approach that\ncan be used by government entities, social networks, and\nmessage board administrators concerned with minimizing false\nadvertising and misinformation and the potential threats they\npose.\nLimitations\nThis study had several limitations. First, it was built only on\nthe Twitter social networking platform. In addition, although\nwe did not explicitly acknowledge “bots” on Twitter, this was\nimplicitly addressed during the annotation process where the\ntweets that appeared to be machine-generated were not\nconsidered cases of commercial CBD or misinformation. In\naddition, this model was trained on a collection of CBD tweets\nfrom before the COVID-19 pandemic, that is, before words like\n“COVID,” “COVID-19,” “corona,” and “coronavirus” would\nhave been associated with “CBD” and “cannabidiol.” In this\ncase, we applied a CBD commercial tweet classifier that was\ntrained on tweets that were primarily authored in 2019 to a\ncollection of tweets between 2020 and 2021. Although we did\nobserve satisfactory results in testing this model’s extraction of\ncommercial CBD tweets that also mentioned COVID-19, we\nacknowledge that concept drift is always a potential factor in\nclassifying streaming and should always be considered.\nConclusions\nThere is a clear and pronounced advertising presence on Twitter\nof loosely regulated substances touted to treat COVID-19,\nalthough this type of self-treatment lacks evidentiary support.\nTwitter is a medium known for rapid spread of medical\nmisinformation, perhaps especially concerning substances like\nCBD [54-57]. The COVID-19 pandemic has been yet another\nopportunity for CBD marketers and sellers to mislead the public\nabout CBD’s role in treating or preventing the disease.\nIllegitimate web-based CBD sellers pose a public threat by\nspreading misinformation, selling unregulated products, and\ngenerally sidestepping regulations. Our approach to addressing\nthis issue identified a semantic relationship between tweets\ncontaining false claims about CBD in treating COVID-19 and\nFDA Warning Letters. Using transformer language models and\nquotes from FDA Warning Letters to other CBD advertisers,\nthis framework can be easily adapted to find misinformation\nabout other conditions and substances, thereby potentially\nserving a crucial purpose in benefiting public health.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors wish to thank Mr Steve Claas at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health Office of Scientific Writing\nfor reviewing this manuscript.\nAuthors' Contributions\nJT, MK, and RV-S conceived and designed the study and cowrote and revised the final manuscript.
