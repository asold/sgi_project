  "abstract": "Ultra-high frequency (UHF) partial discharge (PD) measurements in power transformers are becoming popular because of the advantages of the method. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the basic understanding of the propagation of signals inside the transformer tank and the factors that influence the sensitivity of the measurement. Since the winding represents a major obstacle to the propagation of the UHF signals, it is necessary to study the effect of winding design on signal propagation. Previous research activities have studied these effects using simplified models, and it is essential to consider the complexity of propagation in a complete transformer tank. Additionally, the quality of UHF PD measurements depends, to a large extent, on the sensitivity of the UHF sensors. In this contribution, a simulation model consisting of a simple, grounded enclosure with multiple winding designs is used to study the propagation characteristics of UHF signals when an artificial PD source is placed inside the winding. After analysis of the results, the winding designs are incorporated in an existing and validated simulation model of a 420 kV power transformer and analyzed to observe the influence in a more complex structure. Two commonly used sensor designs are also used in the simulation model to receive the signals. In all cases, the propagation and signal characteristics are analyzed and compared to determine the influence of the winding and sensor design on the UHF signals. It is found that the level of detail of winding design has a significant impact on the propagation characteristics. However, the attenuation characteristics of the UHF signals received by the two sensor designs are similar, with the electric field distribution around the sensor being the key difference.",
