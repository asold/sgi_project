    "abstract": "Wireless embedded systems have seen rapid growth. Nonetheless, the further growth of these systems is now threatened due to the complexities of programming, networking, and deploying them. Developing embedded systems today is a challenging task primarily due to the vast diversity in radio standards, network stacks, microcontrollers, sensors, and other parts of the embedded system ecosystem. This complexity makes it a task suited only for experts, thus hindering the broader adoption of embedded systems.",
