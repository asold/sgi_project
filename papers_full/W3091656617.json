  "full_text": "ORIGINAL PAPER\nA method for the taphonomic assessment of bone tools using 3D\nsurface texture analysis of bone microtopography\nNaomi L. Martisius 1,2 & Shannon P. McPherron 2 & Ellen Schulz-Kornas2,3,4 & Marie Soressi 5 & Teresa E. Steele 1,2\nReceived: 6 March 2020 / Accepted: 6 September 2020\n# The Author(s) 2020\nAbstract\nIncreasingly researchers have employed confocal microscopy and 3D surface texture analysis to assess bone surface modifica-\ntions in an effort to understand ancient behavior. However, quantitative comparisons between the surfaces of purported archae-\nological bone tools and experimentally manufactured and used bones are complicated by taphonomic processes affecting ancient\nbone. Nonetheless, it may be reasonable to assume that bones within the same deposits are altered similarly and thus these\nalterations are quantifiable. Here we show how unworked bones can be used to quantify the taphonomic effect on bone surfaces\nand how this effect can then be controlled for and incorporated into an analysis for evaluating the modified surfaces of purported\nbone tools. To assess the baseline taphonomy of Middle Paleolithic archaeological deposits associated with typologically\nidentified bone artifacts, specifically lissoirs, we directly compare the surface textures of ancient and modern unworked ribs.\nWe then compare the ancient unworked ribs and lissoirs to assess their differences and predict the ancient artifacts ’original\nsurface state using a multilevel multivariate Bayesian model. Our findings demonstrate that three of five tested surface texture\nparameters (Sa, Spc,a n d IsT) are useful for distinguishing surface type. Our model predictions show that lissoirs tend to be less\nrough, have more rounded surface peaks, and exhibit more directionally oriented surfaces. These characteristics are likely due to\nanthropogenic modifications and would have been more pronounced at deposition. Quantifying taphonomic alterations moves us\none step closer to accurately assessing how bone artifacts were made and used in the ancient past.\nKeywords 3D surface texture . Confocal microscopy .

A particular\nfocus of the study of ancient material culture is to tease out the\nnuances of an object ’s production process, use, disposal, and\npost-depositional alterations. Microscopic alterations of an ar-\ntifact’s surface provide insight into such processes. Attempts\nat understanding the microscopic traces left on an artifact dur-\ning its use life date back to the mid-twentieth century or even\nearlier (Curwen 1930; Semenov 1964; Vaughan 1981).\nMethodological developments continued in this field through\nthe last half of the twentieth century, though most approaches\nremained qualitative in nature and therefore subject to discrep-\nancies between researchers (Stemp et al. 2016) .T h en e e df o r\nquantitative development was recognized early on (Beyries\net al. 1988; Grace 1989; Grace et al. 1985) but did not begin\nto take hold until the twenty-first century (Evans and Donahue\n2008; Stemp and Stemp 2001, 2003). While various 3D quan-\ntitative methods have been employed (Stemp et al. 2016), the\nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article\n(https://doi.org/10.1007/s12520-020-01195-y) contains supplementary\nmaterial, which is available to authorized users.\n* Naomi L.

Even so, these methods have only infrequently been\ndirectly applied to the archaeological record (Caux et al. 2018;\nGalland et al. 2019;I b á ñ e ze ta l . 2014;I b á ñ e ze ta l . 2016;\nStevens et al. 2010). Largely, this is due to the uncertainty\nof post-depositional effects such as striations and rounding\nof artifact surfaces as well as those with patinas (Caux et al.\n2018; Galland et al. 2019;W e r n e r2018). There has been little\nmethodological development devoted to the study of surface\ntextures on other materials such as ochre (Rosso et al. 2017)o r\nbone (Bradfield 2020; d'Errico and Backwell 2009; Lesnik\n2011; Martisius et al. 2018;W a t s o na n dG l e a s o n2016), and\neven more rarely on taphonomic alterations of bone (Vietti\n2016). Other 3D quantitative techniques applied to bone sur-\nface modifications such as cut marks, trampling traces, and\ntooth marks on archaeological materials have benefited from a\nfair amount of methodological advancement (Archer and\nBraun 2013;B e l l oa n dS o l i g o 2008; Bello et al. 2011;\nGümrükçü and Pante 2018;H a r r i se ta l . 2017; Otárola-\nCastillo et al. 2018; Pante et al. 2017; Valtierra et al. 2020),\nwhich has been largely motivated by a debate over a report of\ncut-marked bones substantially older than 2.5 Ma\n(Dominguez-Rodrigo et al. 2010; McPherron et al. 2010).\nTo ensure that interpretations of these controversial marks\nare secure, new methods including the use of Bayesian statis-\ntical analyses have been advanced (Harris et al. 2017; Otárola-\nCastillo et al. 2018). Employing Bayesian modeling with data\nderived from 3D models allows for probabilistic interpreta-\ntions about the form of the bone modifications (Otárola-\nCastillo and Torquato 2018). However, there is currently no\ncodified set of procedures for assessing the surface texture of\narchaeological bone microtopography. This study aims to be-\ngin this process and advance our ability to interpret ancient\nbone artifacts modified through post-depositional effects.\nAs current 3D quantitative methods stand, there are few\nbaselines against which functional interpretations of bone\nmicrotopography can be made (d'Errico and Backwell 2009;\nLesnik 2011; Martisius et al. 2018; Watson and Gleason\n2016). In order to understand how and why a bone object\nwas made and used, and directly relate modification to\nbehavior, certain comparative metrics must be in place.\nEspecially when dealing with innovative quantitative technol-\nogies, it may not be enough to replicate a bone tool, use it, and\nthen immediately apply those findings to the archaeological\nrecord. A number of post-depositional effects will have likely\naltered the ancient artifact to some extent, obscuring or per-\nhaps imitating manufacturin g and microwear traces.\nTraditionally, objects with clear taphonomic effects have ei-\nther been excluded from such analyses or the entire surfaces\nwere scrutinized to locate unaffected areas (Burroni et al.\n2002). Though these qualitative initial assessments should\nalways be undertaken, this may be a more difficult endeavor\nwhen studying objects made from organic components such\nas bone that have undergone chemical and physical alterations\nsince initial deposition (Hedges 2002; Nielsen-Marsh and\nHedges 2000).\nLittle is known about how the changes in bone geochem-\nistry alter the microtopography of bone artifact surfaces\n(Krajcarz 2019;O rłowska 2018). There is evidence that some\nphysical post-depositional processes partially affect surface\ntexture on teeth (Böhm et al. 2019) and cut marks on bone\n(Gümrükçü and Pante 2018). In addition, it has been shown\nthat bone surface roughness increases with bone weathering\nstages (Behrensmeyer1978;V i e t t i2016), but it is not yet clear\nhow other post-depositional alterations may affect surface\nroughness and other surface texture parameters of bone\nmicrotopography including microwear. Resolving this is es-\nsential since many of the earliest bone technologies may pre-\nserve ambiguous microwear traces obscured by post-\ndepositional effects. An essential component of the ground-\nwork needed to understand these potentially ambiguous bone\nobjects is the ability to quantitatively isolate taphonomic sig-\nnatures. Assuming that each archaeological assemblage or\ndeposit has its own measurable taphonomic effect due to dia-\ngenetic factors such as collagen loss, increased crystallinity, or\ndissolution (Hedges 2002; Nielsen-Marsh and Hedges 2000),\nprecise measurements like those taken for surface texture anal-\nysis may be useful in this endeavor. Therefore, in this study,\nwe show how unworked bones coming from the same archae-\nological deposit as purported bone tools can be used to quan-\ntify the taphonomic effect on bone surfaces and how this effect\nc a nt h e nb ec o n t r o l l e df o ra n di n c o r p o r a t e di n t oa na n a l y s i sf o r\nassessing modifications that occurred prior to the deposition\nof those purported bone tools. We do not aim to determine\nwhich diagenetic processes have affected the assemblages as\nchemical analyses would be required for an accurate assess-\nment (Hedges 2002). This direct comparison should allow for\nthe isolation and quantification of the taphonomic effects in\nthe archaeological assemblages and the anthropogenic quali-\nties of the worked bone in the sample, which will then provide\nthe opportunity to predict the initial surface texture of the\narchaeological bone artifacts. By doing so, we aim to resolve\nsome of the many confounding factors that can muddy the\nArchaeol Anthropol Sci (2020) 12: 251Page 2 of 16251\ninterpretation of these artifacts. A further aim of this article is\nto establish an initial sampling protocol for applying 3D sur-\nface texture analysis to archaeological bones. The protocol\nwill serve as a framework for the development of methods\nfor the quantitative analysis of archaeological bone material.\nMaterials and methods\nBone tools, or technological objects made from an animal ’s\nskeletal remains, are commonly found in archaeological sites\nattributed to recent humans, i.e., after 50 ka (e.g., Bradfield\net al. 2018;H u b l i ne ta l .2020; Langley et al. 2016;L e g r a n d\n2007; Sidéra 1993;T e j e r o2014;T e j e r oe ta l . 2016;Z h a n g\net al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2018), and sometimes preserved in\narchaeological layers of other hominins (e.g., Backwell and\nd'Errico 2001;G a u d z i n s k i1999;J u l i e ne ta l .2015; Mania and\nMania 2005; Radmilli and Boschian 1996;S a n oe ta l . 2020;\nSoressi et al. 2013). Purported Neandertal-made formal bone\ntools, those manufactured with techniques specific to bone\nsuch as scraping and grinding (d'Errico et al. 2012), come\nfrom two late Middle Paleolithic sites in southwest France\n(Martisius et al. 2020; Soressi et al. 2013). Five rib fragments\nhave been preserved in three different layers at Abri Peyrony\nand Pech-de-l’Azé I (Fig. 1 a ,b ,c ,d ,a n de) and are interpreted\nto be lissoirs, a French typological term meaning “smoothers”\n(Leroi-Gourhan 1968). All five of these objects exhibit mor-\nphological characteristics consistent with lissoir typology\nsuch as their elongated overall shape with a rounded or ogival\ndistal end that exhibits polish (Averbouh 2000; Camps-Fabrer\n1966;L a r t e t 1861; Mons and Stordeur 1977; Sonneville-\nBordes 1960; Tartar 2009). We note that unless stated other-\nwise, here we use the term lissoir in this typological sense only\nwithout the implied function in the same way that retouched\nflakes in the Middle Paleolithic are called scrapers.\nFour of the five artifacts were taxonomically identified\nusing nondestructive zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry,\nall of which were attributed to aurochs or bison (Martisius\net al. 2020). The consistent use of large bovid ribs as the raw\nmaterial for making these tools suggests they were strategical-\nly selected by Neandertals. The indications that these artifacts\nwere shaped prior to use come from parallel striations along\nsome of the artifact edges and surfaces, which are consistent\nwith grinding against a coarse stone and scraping with a flint\nedge (Martisius 2019; Soressi et al. 2013). The initial publi-\ncation describing four of these tools suggested they are the\nfirst specialized bone tools in Europe, due to their standard-\nized shape and similarity to tools specifically made for work-\ning animal skins (Soressi et al. 2013). In addition, one of the\nartifacts preserves characteristics such as rounding of the up-\nper reliefs and smoothing of furrows of the microtopography,\nfeatures consistent with the use on a material like animal skin\n(Soressi et al. 2013). These types of bone tools are often found\nin later assemblages such as those from the Upper Paleolithic\n(Tartar 2009), and similar bone tools are even used by modern\nleather workers (Soressi et al. 2013). The presence of the same\ntool type in Neandertal contexts could suggest that Neandertal\nuse of lissoirs was similar to humans during the subse-\nquent Upper Paleolithic. Arguments for grouping these\ntools into a common category of use that spans\nNeandertal to modern times will require better quantita-\ntive data from the tools themselves.\nThough qualitative observations are informative for de-\nscribing bone surface modifications, a complementary quan-\ntitative approach will allow for the precise measurement of\nspecific features of the bone microtopography and the\nFig. 1 Photographs of the lissoirs\n(a, b, c, d, e) and some of the\nunworked rib fragments (f, g, h, i,\nj, k, l) in this study at (a, g, i, j, k)\nPech-de-l’Azé I (PA I) and (b, c,\nd, e, f, h, l) Abri Peyrony (AP); (a)\nPA I G8-1417, layer 4; (b) AP-\n4209, layer 3A; (c) AP-4493,\nlayer 3B; (d) AP-10818, layer 3B;\n(e) AP-7839, layer 3B; (f) AP-\n6347, layer 3B; (g) PA I G8-\n1116b, layer 4; (h) AP-3468a,\nlayer 3B; (i) PA I G8-1116a, layer\n4; (j) PA I G8-1386b, layer 4; (k)\nPA I G8-1386a, layer 4; (l) AP-\n3468b, layer 3B.

The aim\nof this study is to quantify the microtopographic differences\nbetween modern and ancient bone fragments and develop a\nmethod for predicting the initial surface texture states of an-\ncient bone artifacts. Specifically, we compare modern un-\nworked ribs and ancient unworked rib fragments preserved\nin the Middle Paleolithic archaeological layers associated with\nthe lissoirs at Abri Peyrony and Pech-de-l ’Azé I (Fig. 1f, g, h,\ni, j, k, and l). We expect the modern and ancient unworked rib\nfragments to exhibit quantitative differences indicative of\n50,000 years of post-depositional microscopic alterations to\nthe bone microstructure. The amount of surface texture differ-\nences obtained in this assessment will allow us to estimate the\nbackground taphonomy of the archaeological assemblages.\nHaving the ability to quantitatively assess the changes that\nhave occurred over millennia will be key in our ability to\npredict ancient unobserved surface textures for bone artifacts.\nThe lissoir surfaces will then be compared with this tapho-\nnomic baseline to predict the range of their original surface\ntextures. With the ability to quantify the taphonomic effect of\nancient bone surfaces and utilize this effect to estimate the\ninitial surfaces of purported bone tools, we aim to develop a\nmethod that can ultimately be used to assess the manufacture\nand use traces of archaeological bone artifacts. The study\nsample is systematically targeted based on qualitative obser-\nvations of the different bone surfaces. We expect that observ-\nable microscopic distinctions (e.g., striations and smoothed\nsurface features) between the lissoirs and the unworked rib\nfragments, both ancient and modern, should correspond to\nmeasurable quantitative differences. In fact, it would be sur-\nprising to find no distinctions between the surface types. This\nstudy is not meant as a replacement of traditional microwear\nanalyses, but as a proof of concept to demonstrate the useful-\nness of quantifying the differences between bone surfaces. In\nconducting this analysis on both ancient and modern un-\nworked bones to ones that are proposed to be manufactured\nand used as tools in the past, we begin to develop a framework\nfor employing surface texture parameters in a meaningful\nway. With a more complete understanding of these parameters\nand how they relate to the various surface types, we can begin\nto formulate theoretical frameworks for applying more\ntargeted analyses such as those aimed at distinguishing mate-\nrial wear as well as investigations into other bone objects that\nare even more challenging to analyze.\nSamples\nFive bone tools typed as lissoirs and 20 unworked rib frag-\nments from the two Middle Paleolithic sites in France, Pech-\nde-l’Azé I and Abri Peyrony, were used in this study (Fig. 1;\nTable 1;T a b l eS1). We targeted ungulate rib fragments pre-\nserved within the same archaeological layers and located in\nclose proximity to the lissoirs knowing that taphonomy can\nvary across archaeological deposits. In one case, we were able\nto include an unworked rib fragment that was found in the\nsame bucket of screened material as one of the artifacts\n(lissoir : AP-4493, ancient unworked rib: AP-4493b;\nTable S1). Recently, it has been shown that ungulate ribs\nexhibit similar surface roughness values (Vietti 2016), so\ncomparisons including differing ungulate species should not\nbias results. The partially fresh modern cow ( Bos taurus)r i b s\nobtained from Archeoshop and scanned for a previous exper-\nimental study were used for comparative purposes (Martisius\net al. 2018). These scans originated from surface molds taken\nfrom the flattest surfaces of eight unworked rib fragments at\ntime 0 of the experiment. The lissoirs were scanned directly,\nwhile the unworked ribs had surface molds taken (President\nJet Plus Light Body, Coltène, Altstätten, Switzerland), which\nwere brought to the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary\nAnthropology (MPI-EVA), Department of Human Evolution\nin Leipzig, Germany, for further analysis (Table S1;\nTable S2). Because the modern and ancient unworked ribs ’\nscans were directly made on surface molds, comparisons be-\ntween these two sample types will not be confounded by the\ntype of material scanned, if these differences are significant at\nall. Previous research has shown that low-viscosity molding\nmaterial adequately replicates microscopic surfaces for most\nquantitative measurements (Goodall et al. 2015; Martisius\net al. 2018), so direct comparisons between the bones and\nmolds should be reasonable. However, a recent study on min-\niaturized technological components showed molding material\nto underestimate the original surface (Baruffi et al. 2017).\nThough little research on quantifying replicated bone surfaces\nhas been performed, our previous study found that molding\nmaterial may not accurately replicate the shape of the peaks on\nthe bone, resulting in decreased values for one surface texture\nparameter, arithmetic mean peak curvature [ Spc] (Martisius\net al. 2018). Because of this, we use Spc on molded bone\nsurfaces with caution. Other surface texture parameters did\nnot seem to differ appreciably between measurements on the\nTable 1 Number of specimens used in this study by type including the\nsite and layer in which they were preserved\nSource Layer Specimen type Number of pieces\nModern sample Unworked rib fragment 8\nAbri Peyrony L-3A Lissoir 1\nUnworked rib fragment 2\nL-3B Lissoir 3\nUnworked rib fragment 11\nPech-de-l’Azé I 4 Lissoir 1\nUnworked rib fragment 6\nII-4 Unworked rib fragment 1\nTotal 33\nArchaeol Anthropol Sci (2020) 12: 251Page 4 of 16251\noriginal bone and those on molding material (Martisius et al.\n2018). Further, inconsistencies may arise at higher magnifica-\ntions or due to human error in the molding process (Baruffi\net al. 2017; Macdonald et al. 2018; Mihlbachler et al. 2019).\nGiven that our analysis is conducted using a × 20 lens, mold-\ning inconsistencies are less likely to affect our results. In ad-\ndition, each rib fragment had multiple molds taken, so their\nsubsequent comparison was undertaken prior to scanning.\n3D surface texture analysis\nThe Middle Paleolithic lissoirs and molds of the unworked\nribs (modern and ancient) were scanned at multiple loci with\na confocal disk-scanning microscope ( μsurf mobile,\nNanofocus AG, Oberhausen, Germany), using a × 20 lens\n(numerical aperture = 0.4, field of view = 0.8 mm 2) provided\nby the MPI-EVA in Leipzig, Germany. An attempt was made\nto scan the distal ends of the lissoirs in a systematic way using\na crosswise formation with one scan in the center, two along\nthe longitudinal axis, and two along the horizontal axis (Fig.\nS1). However, differential preservation did not allow for sys-\ntematic sampling to this degree, so other scanning locations\nwere incorporated using a coding system developed to identi-\nfy where each scan originated (Fig. S1). For many of the\nartifacts, differential preservation constrained our ability to\ntake multiple scans of the distal ends, so sampling was ex-\npanded to other areas of the tool. In doing this, we intend to\nquantify an overall “lissoir effect,” which may include sur-\nfaces modified by manufacturing, use, or handling, rather than\nsubject our statistical analysis to the stochastic effects of the\nsmall sample restricted to the distal end. All artifacts were\norientated so that the longitudinal axis of the artifact was along\nthe X-axis of the μsurf mobile with the distal end (tip) posi-\ntioned at the extent of the X-axis. The distal end of the molds\nof the unworked rib fragments was arbitrarily assigned. From\nthis point, a grid was set up from a central (C) position, most\noften 3.375 mm proximally from the tip. Given the field of\nview, each possible scan in the grid was 0.8 mm 2 with a\nminimal amount of overlap in each area (Fig. S1). After each\nscan was taken, scan quality was reviewed. Those with 95%\nor more of the surface points measured were accepted for\nfurther study (Martisius et al. 2018;S c h u l ze ta l . 2010,\n2013a). Scans of lesser accuracy were remeasured altering\npitch, gain, exposure, or brightness values until 95% of the\nmicrotopography was captured.\nThe scans were then transferred to the MountainsMap\nPremium v. 7.4.8076 Analysis software (Digital Surf,\nBesançon, France) for 3D surface texture analysis. To con-\nstruct meshed axiomatic 3D models of the modern\nand archaeological pieces (Fig. 2), the following procedures\nwere applied: leveling (least square method), mirroring the y-\nand z-axes for surface molds, and removal of outliers (isolated\nand edge outlier removal, with normal strength, and hole fill in\n< 225 points, noise removal), non-measured points fill in\n(smoothing method), and form removal using a polyno-\nmial of 2nd degree (Martisius et al. 2018;S c h u l ze ta l .\n2010, 2013a;S c h u l ze ta l . 2013b).\nBefore the meshed axiomatic 3D models of the artifacts\ncould be analyzed, an additional in-house step was taken to\nensure data would be informative. All models and correspond-\ning digital images were visually inspected for indications of\nsizable taphonomic alterations that removed the cortical bone\nsurface and exposed internal structures (Fig. S2). Surfaces\nwith large craters or a number of exposed pores were excluded\nfrom further analyses because measurements of these surfaces\nwould be skewed towards capturing the variation of the bone\nstructure and not the effects indicative of anthropogenic alter-\nations (Martisius et al. 2018). Similarly, modern rib scans with\nlarge irregular trenches that may have been formed during\nperiosteum removal were excluded from further analyses\n(Fig. S2). Only the meshed axiomatic 3D models with at least\n90% of the cortical surface preserved were kept for statistical\nmodeling. Consequently, many of the surface scans did not\nmeet this threshold and only a small number of meshed axi-\nomatic 3D models of each specimen were kept for analysis\n(Table S1;T a b l eS2). Models from both ancient and modern\nunworked ribs were included in similar proportions (modern\nunworked ribs, 68%; ancient unworked ribs, 67%), while\nmodels of lissoir surfaces were disproportionately affected\nby large irregular surface features thus included at a rate of\nonly 8%. Figure 3 shows an example of one of the artifacts\nand its surface locations used for statistical modeling.\nStatistical modeling\nWe chose five ISO 25178 parameters for statistical modeling:\narithmetic mean height [ Sa], autocorrelation length [ Sal], ar-\nithmetic mean peak curvature [ Spc], upper material ratio\n[Smr1], and isotropy [ IsT]( F i g .4; International Organization\nfor Standardization 2012). The first four ISO 25178 parame-\nters were selected because in a prior experimental study they\nshowed some degree of differentiation between variously\nmodified bone surfaces (Martisius et al. 2018). The fifth pa-\nrameter, IsT, was also included because it should be an indi-\ncator of the anthropogenic traces on the lissoirs given that\ntheir surfaces retain nonrandomly oriented striations from\nmanufacture and use.\nStatistical modeling follows protocols in Martisius et al.\n(2018). The five ISO 25178 parameters were log transformed\nto stabilize variances and distributions. The statistical model\nfor the observations Y, a matrix of p = 5 columns (log-trans-\nformed ISO 25178 parameters), and n = 136 rows (3D\nmodels) is a multivariate mixed model of the form:\nY ¼ XB þ ZU þ E;\nArchaeol Anthropol Sci (2020) 12: 251 Page 5 of 16 251\n(Amemiya 1994) where XB represents the fixed effects,ZU the\nrandom effects, and E the residual error.

After fitting two\nmodels of increasing complexity with different effects, we\ncompared widely applicable information criterion (WAIC)\nscores (Vehtari et al. 2017) and found that a design (M1) with\nthe single fixed effect specimen type (ancient lissoir,a n c i e n t\nunworked rib, and modern unworked rib) generated model\npredictions best (Table 2). For M1, B is a 3 × 5 matrix of fixed\neffects for each specimen type, for each surface texture param-\neter. The design matrix X is a 136 × 3 matrix of zeros\nand ones. E is a 136 × 5 residual matrix. Therefore, M1\nis a multilevel, multivariate Bayesian model, including a\nfixed effect ( specimen type ), random effects ( specimen\nand source), and error (Table 2).\nCompared with the results in Martisius et al. ( 2018), vari-\nation in surface texture parameter values was over-dispersed\nwith respect to the Gaussian distribution, so we chose the\nmultivariate Student t distribution. The specimen and source\nrandom effects were adequately modeled by multivariate\nGaussian distributions, based on goodness of fit checks. See\nMartisius et al. ( 2018) for further details of the multivariate\nmixed model.\nWe used a Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo method\nto estimate statistical model effects, using the library rstan\nversion 2.19.3 (Stan Development Team 2019) of the statisti-\ncal computing language R version 4.0.0 (R Core Team 2020).\nWe allowed a 4000-iteration warm-up for all four chains and\ngenerated 2000 samples per chain for a total of 8000 posterior\nsamples for inference. Scaled and squared Mahalanobis dis-\ntances between observations and predicted values were exam-\nined to check goodness of fit. Theoretical quantiles of the F-\ndistribution (Roth 2013) were used to compare Mahalanobis\ndistances using a quantile-quantile plot (Fig. S3).\nThe posterior samples were used to predict the lissoir initial\nsurface state for the five ISO 25178 parameters using\nΔISO ¼ ARISO−MRISO\nILISO ¼ ALISO−ΔISO\nwhere Δ ISO represents the contrast of the two unworked rib\nspecimen types (AR: ancient unworked rib and MR:m o d e r n\nunworked rib) for each ISO 25178 parameter.

Because\nspecimen and source were adjusted for in the statistical model,\nthe model predictions should have captured the differences\nbetween the specimen types.\nA pairwise scatterplot matrix of the five surface texture param-\neters displays all observations, and colored ellipses indicate 95%\nposterior probabilities for the estimated means of each parameter\npair, forspecimen type(ancientlissoir, ancient unworked rib, and\nmodern unworked rib) and the predicted initiallissoirsurface state\n(Fig. 5). Paired comparisons are useful for determining which\nsurface texture parameters best distinguish the specimen types.\nThere is some degree of overlap between most of the comparisons,\nbut many of the parameter comparisons show clear trends\ndistinguishing the ancient unworked rib fragments from both the\nmodern ribs and the lissoirs. Surprisingly, many of the compari-\nsons do not distinguish the modern unworked ribs from the ancient\nlissoirs, though thelissoirvalues are often clustered in one area of\nthe modern samples’total variation, values that tend to be inter-\nmediate between the modern and ancient unworked ribs (Fig.5).\nThe modern and ancient unworked ribs show the clearest\ndistinctions using the three parameters, Sa, Spc,a n d IsT,a n d\nin the comparison, Spc:IsT, the model predictions show no\noverlap between these two bone types (Fig. 5). Generally,\nthe comparisons with Sa, Spc,a n d IsT indicate that the ancient\nunworked ribs have higher values than the modern unworked\nribs. This demonstrates that the ancient samples are more\nrough, have more pointed surface peaks, and have more iso-\ntropic surfaces when compared with the modern unworked\nribs. Sal shows a slight trend with the ancient samples having\nFig. 5 Scatterplot matrix of bone specimen type effects.

There is no clear trend using Smr1, which indicates\nthat the ancient and modern unworked ribs have similar por-\ntions of material in the peaks of their surfaces.\nThe model predictions indicate similar trends when focus-\ning on the two ancient specimen types (lissoirs and ancient\nunworked ribs), though these distinctions are less prominent\nthan those of the two unworked rib samples (Fig. 5). There is\nlittle overlap for three of the parameters, Sa, Spc, and IsT,\nwhile Sal and Smr1 are less informative. In the three clearest\ncomparisons (Sa:Spc, Spc:IsT,a n dSa:IsT), the lissoir surfaces\nhave the lowest values, while the ancient unworked rib frag-\nments have higher values. This indicates that the lissoir sur-\nfaces are less rough, have more rounded surface peaks, and\nhave more anisotropic surface textures as compared with the\nancient unworked rib fragments. Smr1 also shows a slight\ntrend with lissoirsgenerally having lower values implying that\nthey have a smaller portion of material in the peaks of the\nsurface. Sal values are not well distinguishable between the\nancient specimen types indicating that both types of artifact\nsurfaces have similar wavelengths or frequencies.\nThe initial surface states of the lissoirs are predicted to have\nthe lowest values for most of the surface texture parameters,\nbut these predictions also have the largest variance due to the\nuncertainty in all aspects of the model used to make these\npredictions. When compared with the modern unworked ribs,\na similar trend like what is observed for the two ancient spec-\nimen types (lissoirs and ancient unworked ribs) is observed.\nThe model predicts that the initial lissoir surfaces would have\nbeen less rough, have more rounded surface peaks, and have\nmore anisotropic surface textures compared with the un-\nworked ribs deposited alongside them.\nDiscussion\nOur results indicate that there are quantifiable differences be-\ntween some of the surface types and that these differences\nhave significant implications for directly applying surface tex-\nture data of experimentally worked bone to ancient artifacts.\nWhen doing so using 3D quantitative data, a correction factor\nrepresentative of the background taphonomy will need to be\nemployed in order to make accurate interpretations based on\nmodern experimental data.\nWhen analogous bones differ\nOf importance are the quantitative differences between the\nancient and modern unworked rib samples. Given that these\ntwo sample types are distinct in many of the pairwise compar-\nisons (Fig. 5), it would not be wise to make interpretations\nbased on a direct comparison of the surface texture values for\nmodern and ancient bones. If we assume by analogy that\nungulate ribs in the past have a similar microstructure to un-\ngulate bones today, then we would assume that any differ-\nences observed are likely the result of taphonomic alterations\nthat have accumulated over 50,000 years (Soressi et al. 2013).\nPinpointing the exact diagenetic alterations is beyond this\nstudy, because there are likely to be multiple correlated factors\nat play that are more easily detected via chemical analyses\n(Hedges 2002). Because of multiple possible taphonomic fac-\ntors, the microtopography of the unworked ribs have become\nrougher with more pointed surface peaks over time (Fig. 6). A\npossible explanation could be related to the dissolution of the\nbone surface, which increases porosity and contributes to the\nloss of collagen (Hedges 2002). Additionally, the ancient sur-\nfaces tend to be more isotropic, which means that they are less\ndirectionally oriented. Bone is a naturally oriented and hierar-\nchically organized structure (Fig. 2c; Rho et al. 1998); this is\nexhibited by the low IsT values of the modern unworked ribs\n(Fig. 5). Because the ancient unworked ribs have higher IsT\nvalues and therefore have less oriented surfaces, the tapho-\nnomic processes that affected the bone likely occurred in a\nfairly consistent manner over the bone surface obscuring the\nstructure of the bone fibers.\nThough the differences between the modern and unworked\nbone samples are likely the result of microscopic changes to\nthe bone surfaces over millennia, there are a few other factors\nto consider. It is possible that one or both sample types are\nbiased in some way. For example, the modern specimens\nderive from cow ribs, but it is not clear which ungulate spe-\ncies the ancient unworked rib fragments originate from. Due\nto their fragmentary nature, it is difficult to make species\nidentifications of ancient ribs based on morphological char-\nacteristics (Martisius et al. 2020). For this study, we used\nancient ungulate ribs because it is likely that the bone\nFig. 6 Trajectory of surface texture parameters after millennia of\ntaphonomic effects.

The filled-in ellipses represent the bone samples\nwith unknown taphonomic alterations. The dashed ellipse represents the\nhypothesized initial state of the lissoirs for the two displayed parameters\nArchaeol Anthropol Sci (2020) 12: 251 Page 9 of 16 251\nmicrotopography of differing ungulate species are very sim-\nilar given their evolutionary history and common growth de-\nvelopment (Currey 2006;G i f f o r d - G o n z a l e z2018). In addi-\ntion, it has been demonstrated that the rib shafts of some\nungulates (deer, elk, horse, and llama) have statistically sim-\nilar initial surface roughness values (Vietti 2016), but other\nsurface texture parameters have not been tested. Further, there\nmay be variation from one animal to another including sex\nand age differences resulting in a broader range of variation;\nother factors including bone freshness may also bias the anal-\nysis and contribute to the patterning observed in this analysis\n(Karr and Outram 2015). Even so, the archaeological un-\nworked rib sample should capture a reasonable amount of\nvariation as it derives from 20 rib fragments from three dif-\nferent archaeological layers at two sites. The modern un-\nworked ribs derive from one source, so it is possible that this\nsample does not include the full extent of modern cow rib\nvariation. It should be noted that the statistical model indi-\ncates that the modern unworked rib sample has greater vari-\nation than the comparable ancient sample for most of the\nsurface texture parameters (Fig. 5), which demonstrates that\nthere is considerable variation within the one source. It is not\nclear if any of the aforementioned factors contributed to the\ndifferences in the two samples, so we can only speculate on\nthe main causes for their distinctions. Whether the difference\nis a result of a biased sample or due to taphonomic alterations\nthat accumulated over 50,000 years, we should be aware of\nthe possible biases in our modern comparative specimens and\ndirectly compare surface texture of modern and ancient sam-\nples with caution (Karr and Outram 2015).\nThe effect of being a lissoir\nGiven that the ancient bone specimen types (ancient unworked\nribs and lissoirs) originate from the same archaeological de-\nposits and in close proximity to each other, it is likely that the\nquantifiable differences between these two samples are not the\nresult of differing taphonomic alterations but of the anthropo-\ngenic qualities of the Neandertal-worked bone. This outcome\nis not surprising but expected given the nonrandom sampling\nstrategy employed and the observed qualitative microscopic\ndifferences (Fig. 2; Fig. 3). Of importance is our ability to\nquantitatively describe these differences.\nSa, or surface roughness, is distinctly lower in the lissoir\nsurfaces compared with the ancient unworked ribs (Fig. 5).\nThis and other surface roughness parameters have been shown\nto distinguish unworked and worked surfaces in experimental\nsamples, especially in those worked for long time intervals\n(Bradfield 2020; Martisius et al. 2018). In our previous study,\nwe showed that Sa values decrease as a bone is worked over\ntime (Martisius et al. 2018). Even in the examples where Sa\nwas the highest at the beginning of the experiment due to\nmodification using stone implements, the Sa values steadily\ndecreased and in some cases were lower than the original\nunworked bone surfaces as the experiment progressed\n(Martisius et al. 2018). Deep parallel striations along some\nof the edges and surfaces of the lissoirs are consistent with\nshaping using a stone implement (e.g., Fig. 2i), though it is not\nclear how extensively the bones were shaped prior to use\n(Martisius 2019; Soressi et al. 2013). The overall lower Sa\nvalues indicate that the lissoirs were likely modified through\nuse, possibly after shaping, which led to the reduction of sur-\nface roughness.\nThough most of the lissoir 3D models used in the statistical\nanalysis are located within 1.5 cm of the distal end ( n =1 4 ) ,a\nsmall portion comes from other locations beyond the main\nworking area of the tools ( n = 5). These locations were added\nto increase the number of usable 3D models without irregular\nsurface features such as sizable pores (Fig. S2) and reduce the\nstochastic effects of small sample size in the statistical model.\nThese 3D models, including the ones in the active area of the\ntools, preserve a variety of empirically observed microwear\ntraces including regularly oriented striations indicative of\nmanufacturing and use (e.g., Fig. 2 g, h, and i). The inclusion\nof a variety of locations within the lissoir sample should re-\nduce the lissoir effect for Sa and increase its variance.\nSpecifically, Sa values would presumably be lower if only\nlocations with visible use-related wear and without larger fea-\ntures resulting from likely contact with a stone implement\nwere included (Fig. 2i), but the model predictions still indicate\noverall low values compared with the unworked bone (Fig. 5).\nThe cause of the reduced Sa values is most likely from the use\nas a tool given that the majority of 3D models are located\nwithin the vicinity of the distal end, but other factors such as\nhandling or rubbing inside a sack may have a similar effect\nand should be quantitatively examined. Nonetheless, the vast\nmajority of the lissoir surfaces are less rough compared with\nthe ancient unworked bone; if we restricted the analyses of the\nlissoirs to only the clearly worked surfaces, then we would\nexpect the differences to be even more extreme.\nAnother surface texture parameter that indicates that the\ntwo ancient bone samples differ is IsT or isotropy (Fig. 5).\nIsotropic surfaces are not patterned with respect to direction\n(Fig. 4). This is in contrast to anisotropic surfaces that have\ndirectional properties. Though natural bone surfaces should\nshow some degree of anisotropy due to its differently oriented\nand hierarchically organized structure (Fig. 2c, f ; Rho et al.\n1998), the ancient unworked rib surfaces (Fig. 2d, e, f )i nt h i s\nstudy are more uniform in their directional properties (more\nisotropic) than those of the lissoirs (Fig. 2 g, h, i; Fig. 3). The\nmore extreme anisotropic properties of the lissoirslikely result\nfrom the striations and grooves produced during unidirection-\nal manufacture and use. Our study indicates that these anthro-\npogenic traces are more directionally patterned than the an-\ncient unworked bone structures. Interestingly, some of the\nmodern unworked bone surfaces are even more anisotropic\nArchaeol Anthropol Sci (2020) 12: 251Page 10 of 16251\nthan the lissoirs(Fig. 5). It is possible that the same factors that\ncaused the ancient unworked bones to be more isotropic also\nhad the same effect on the lissoirs, partially obscuring the\ndirectionally oriented striations.\nSpc, peak curvature, is the third surface texture parameter\nthat indicates that the two ancient surface types differ (Fig. 5).\nSpc was included in the analysis with caution knowing that the\ndental molds used on the unworked bone surfaces (both an-\ncient and modern) may lead to the reduction of their values\ndue to possible replication inconsistencies of the shape of the\nbone peaks (Martisius et al. 2018). Even so, Spc is lower in the\nlissoir surfaces indicating that they have more curved surface\npeaks compared with the ancient unworked rib fragments.\nFurther, if scans were made directly on the unworked bone\nsurfaces and not on the dental impression material, this differ-\nence between the two surface types might be more pro-\nnounced. This pattern is expected, especially if the\nlissoirs were used on a soft, supple material such as\nanimal skin as was originally determined for one of\nthe Middle Paleolithic lissoirs (Soressi et al. 2013).\nDue to its material properties, animal skin should pene-\ntrate all levels of the bone m icrotopography rounding\nout the peaks of the surface. This pattern was demon-\nstrated in Martisius et al. ( 2018), which showed that the\nexperimental samples worked with leather and fresh\nhide had the lowest Spc values. Though other uses are\nlikely to produce rounded peaks, the distinct values of\nthe lissoirs compared with the unworked ribs indicate\nthat the lissoir surfaces were most likely modified by\na soft, supple material.\nThough Smr1 is less informative as there is considerable\noverlap in the values of this surface texture parameter (Fig. 5),\nthere is some indication that lissoir surfaces are different com-\npared with the ancient unworked rib surfaces. The lissoir\nSmr1 values are slightly lower than the majority of ancient\nunworked bones, meaning less of the material is in the peaks\nof the lissoir surfaces. Significantly, all of the Smr1 values of\nthe ancient specimens are within the overall range of the mod-\nern specimens. This indicates that Smr1 may not be useful for\ndistinguishing bone surface microtopography.\nSal, or autocorrelation length, which describes the frequen-\ncy of wavelength of the surface (Fig. 4), does not distinguish\nthe two ancient bone types (Fig. 5). It does, however, indicate\nthat there may be differences between the modern and ancient\nbones as the ancient specimens cluster at the higher range of\nthe overall Sal values. This demonstrates that the ancient bone\nspecimens generally have low frequency or long wave-\nlength surfaces, while the modern bone tends to have\ngreater diversity in this respect. This pattern could be\nexplained through the dissolution of the bone surface, a\nchemical process that is more likely to cause the micro-\nscopic loss of bone material over the whole surface\nrather than in isolated areas (Hedges 2002).\nTowards an understanding of ancient bone through\nsurface texture\nA surprising result of the analysis is that the surface texture\nparameters for the modern unworked ribs and the ancient\nlissoirs overlap (Fig. 5). Taking the statistical results at face\nvalue, one might assume that the purported lissoirs are not\nbone tools at all but unworked ribs. This line of reasoning\nwould only work if the lissoir sample was not affected by\nthe same taphonomic alterations as the ancient unworked ribs,\na highly unlikely scenario. A more likely explanation is that\nthe modern ribs and the lissoirs exhibit converging surface\ntexture values but from different causes. Even though quanti-\ntative methods allow us to be more precise with our analyses,\nmany of the surface texture parameters are still subject to\nequifinality and are thus statistically indistinguishable\n(Lyman 2004). These parameters are averaged values over\nthe area of a measured surface, so a variety of surfaces may\nproduce similar values (International Organization for\nStandardization 2012). For example, Figs. 7 and 8 demon-\nstrate two different examples of one of each of the specimen\ntypes whose surface texture values cluster together in the\npairwise space of parameters in Fig. 5. The 3D models from\nFig. 7 cluster closely in the comparison with Spc and Smr1,\nwhile those in Fig. 8 cluster in the comparison with Sa and\nSpc. All values for each surface parameter are displayed indi-\ncating differences in the non-highlighted values. It is impor-\ntant to recognize the visual differences between each specimen\ntype, yet they exhibit similar values for at least two of the\nsurface texture parameters (Fig. 7; Fig. 8). Employing these\nparameters on bone microtopography is helpful for comparing\nand describing broad trends but the parameters and what they\nare measuring need to be completely understood when trying\nto discriminate smaller differences. To employ this type of\nanalysis, a good understanding of the samples is required.\nThis includes predictions about what values the surface tex-\nture parameters might show, as those parameters should not be\nblindly applied to a sample in search of differences or simi-\nlarities. Given that each of the measured surface areas has one\nvalue per surface texture parameter, it is highly likely that\nvariously affected surfaces could exhibit a similar value.\nIncluding one or two parameters in an analysis will result in\nthe loss of the bigger picture. Employing multivariate\nanalyses on this type of data should reduce the effects\nof equifinality. Similarly, a qualitative component\nshould be incorporated into this type of analysis to ob-\ntain a fuller understanding of the analyzed surfaces.\nThough surface texture does not always distinguish two\ndifferently modified bone surfaces (Martisius et al. 2018;\nWatson and Gleason 2016), especially when using a small\nnumber of parameters, identifying and utilizing the parameters\nthat can help explain the differences in two bone samples are\ncrucial. In this analysis, the differences between the ancient\nArchaeol Anthropol Sci (2020) 12: 251 Page 11 of 16 251\na n dm o d e r nu n w o r k e db o n es a m p l e sc a nb eu s e di na na t t e m p t\nto understand how taphonomy changes bone over time and\nwhat this might mean for assessing bone artifacts with a vari-\nety of surface alterations. Given that the archaeological bones\nin this study derive from sediments that are about 50 ka\n(Soressi et al. 2013), taphonomic alterations are the most like-\nly cause of the differences between the ancient and modern\nunworked bone samples. Bone surface loss through dissolu-\ntion is proportional to the external surface area (Hedges 2002),\nand because ribs are roughly of the same size, their alterations\nwithin the same deposits should be comparable. It is possible\nthat taphonomy affects differently modified surfaces in\nslightly different ways. For example, there is some evidence\nto suggest that compressed and polished bone surfaces resist\nthe effects of weathering (Bradfield 2020;M o o r e 2013),\nwhich might apply to other taphonomic alterations, though\nthis concept has not yet been tested on the surface texture of\nbone microtopography. Alternatively, exposing the internal\nstructure of a bone during the manufacture and use of bone\ntools may accelerate diagenetic processes leading to bone sur-\nface microtopography that has been altered to a greater extent.\nThe percentage of surface scans with sizable irregular features\nremoved from this study could support this ( lissoirs =9 2 % ,\nancient unworked ribs = 33%) (Fig. S2).\nFig. 7 Meshed axiomatic 3D models (0.8 mm 2) of one of each of the\nspecimen types with the values for each of the surface texture parameters.\nThe highlighted rows indicate values that are similar and cluster in the\npairwise space of parameters (peak curvature [ Spc] and upper material\nratio [Smr1]) when plotted\nFig. 8 Meshed axiomatic 3D models (0.8 mm 2) of one of each of the\nspecimen types with the values for each of the surface texture parameters.\nThe highlighted rows indicate values that are similar and cluster in the\npairwise space of parameters (surface roughness [ Sa] and peak curvature\n[Spc]) when plotted\nArchaeol Anthropol Sci (2020) 12: 251Page 12 of 16251\nFor the purposes of this study, we have estimated the\namount of change that may have occurred on the lissoirs over\n50,000 years, while developing a hypothesis for how they\nchanged. We realize that a substantial amount of methodolog-\nical development including experimental analyses on possible\npost-depositional alterations is still needed to accurately re-\nconstruct the surface texture of ancient artifacts. Because it\nis likely that the two ancient specimen types were affected\nby similar taphonomic processes, it should be reasonable to\nassume that their surface textures were altered in relatively\nsimilar ways. Having the ability to measure multiple surface\nfeatures allows us to quantify the changes that have occurred\nover this time frame and may be useful in predicting the initial\nstate of an ancient worked bone. Therefore, the amount of\ndifferences between the modern and ancient unworked rib\nsamples should be relatively comparable to the differences\nbetween the ancient lissoir specimens and what their initial\nstate would have been 50 ka. Using the pairwise comparison\nfor Sa and Spc as an example, we predict that both of these\nvalues have increased over time since the initial deposition of\nthe lissoirs (Fig. 5;F i g .6). Because the ancient unworked ribs\ntend to be rougher with sharper surface peaks compared with\nthe modern unworked bones, it is likely that the ancient\nlissoirs observed today are rougher with more pointed surface\npeaks than they were 50 ka. Therefore, the lissoirs that were\ndeposited in their respective archaeological sites were most\nlikely less rough with more rounded surface peaks, values that\nwould have likely been lower than those of the modern un-\nworked ribs (Fig. 6).\nThe overall results of this study indicate that there is a\n“lissoir effect”that is quantitatively different from the ancient\nunworked rib fragments of the same archaeological deposits.\nIn addition, the ancient and modern unworked ribs show\ndistinguishing quantifiable features that likely result from\ntaphonomic alterations, a key finding that should be helpful\nfor reconstructing the original state of ancient worked bone.\nOnce an archaeological bone artifact ’s surface texture is con-\nfidently reconstructed, these parameters can then be compared\nwith those of modern experimentally worked bone in an effort\nto understand how the ancient bone object was manufactured\nand used. This study provides a first step towards predicting\nthe original surface texture values of the ancient lissoirs.W i t h\nmore research into how bone surfaces are altered over time,\nwe should be able to make even more accurate predictions\nabout an artifact ’s original surface state. Extensive analyses\nare needed to assess various taphonomic effects. This could\ninclude chemical analyses with an effort to correlate diagenet-\nic factors such as collagen loss, increased crystallinity, or dis-\nsolution with changes to the microtopography of bone\n(Hedges 2002; Nielsen-Marsh and Hedges 2000). In addition,\nexperimental analyses assessing how differentially worn sur-\nfaces are altered through simulated taphonomic effects will be\nimportant for making better predictions about the original\nstate of ancient bone (Gümrükçü and Pante 2018). Further,\nextensive experimentation on how varying materials affect\nbone from differing skeletal elements and species will be\nkey in our ability to quantitatively estimate the use of bone\nartifacts (Martisius et al. 2018;W a t s o na n dG l e a s o n2016).\nContinued methodological refinement including selection of\nmultiple meaningful surface texture parameters and combin-\ning data from differing sources will increase the accuracy of\nmodel predictions about the original state of bone artifacts and\nhow they were used in the past. Even so, the assessment of an\noverall effect of taphonomy on Middle Paleolithic bone tools\nprovides a starting point for future analyses of ambiguous\nbone artifacts.\nConclusions\nQuantitative comparisons between the surfaces of purported\narchaeological bone tools and experimentally manufactured\nand used bones are complicated by taphonomic processes.\nThis study demonstrates how unworked bones can be used to\nquantify the taphonomic effect on bone surfaces and how this\neffect can then be controlled for and incorporated into an anal-\nysis for evaluating the modified surfaces of purported bone\ntools. Using insights from a previous experimental study that\nemployed a similar Bayesian statistical model and surface tex-\nture parameters to bone surfaces (Martisius et al. 2018), we are\nable to demonstrate the quantitative differences of three spec-\nimen types (modern unworked ribs, ancient unworked ribs, and\nancient lissoirs) and use this information to predict surface\ntexture values for the initial state of Middle Paleolithic bone\ntools typed as lissoirs. Importantly, our results demonstrate that\nmodern and ancient unworked ribs are distinguishable and that\ntaphonomic alterations are quantifiable using three of five test-\ned surface texture parameters ( Sa, Spc,a n d IsT). These differ-\nences have implications for directly applying surface texture\nvalues from experimentally worked bones to archaeological\nspecimens, which could lead to erroneous results. Modified\nbones from archaeological contexts often have complex se-\nquences of alterations that are further complicated by overlying\ntaphonomic effects. With the ability to quantify taphonomic\nalterations after deposition by assessing the differences be-\ntween modern and ancient bones of the same skeletal element,\nwe develop a framework for estimating initial bone artifact\nsurface textures. Crucially, this outcome brings us one step\ncloser to meaningfully applying surface texture data of modern\nexperimental samples to archaeological specimens in order to\nevaluate how ancient bone objects were manufactured and\nused. In addition, our results show that there are quantifiable\ndifferences between the surfaces of the lissoirs and ancient\nunworked ribs, which corroborate qualitative observations.\nResults indicate that lissoir surfaces are less rough, have more\nrounded surface peaks, and are more directionally oriented\nArchaeol Anthropol Sci (2020) 12: 251 Page 13 of 16 251\ncompared with the unworked rib fragments in the archaeolog-\nical deposits. This same trend is observed for the predicted\ninitial lissoir surface states and the modern ribs, though more\nvariance exists due to uncertainty in the combined model pre-\ndictions. These differences indicate that the lissoirs were an-\nthropogenically modified through extended use, which may\ninclude secondary factors like handing. Though we did not\nset out to infer the function of the Middle Paleolithic artifacts\nin this study, our results could be consistent with a previous\ninvestigation that concluded the use on a soft, supple material\nfor one of the artifacts (Soressi et al. 2013). As a proof of\nconcept, this study provides an important methodological\nstarting point for applying 3D surface texture analysis to ar-\nchaeological bone artifacts. This analysis of differentially pre-\nserved Middle Paleolithic bones compared with modern bone\nsurfaces is a first step towards assessing more ambiguous bone\nartifacts. Continued methodological refinement will contribute\nto our ability to accurately interpret ancient bone artifacts and\nultimately contribute to our understanding of ancient human\ntechnological choices and decision-making.\nAcknowledgments We are grateful to Mark N.
