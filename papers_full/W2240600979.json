  "abstract": "Abstract: This paper presents the development and im-plementation of a digital simulation model of a three-phase, three-leg, power transformer. The proposed model, imple-mented in MATLAB environment, is based on the physical concept of representing windings as mutually coupled coils, and it is intended to study its adequacy to incorporate, at a later stage, the influences of the occurrence of windings in-ter-turn short-circuits. Both simulation and laboratory tests results, obtained so far, for a three-phase, 6 kVA transformer, demonstrate the adequacy of the model under normal operat-ing conditions.",
