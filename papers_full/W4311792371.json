  "abstract": "Inductive voltage transformers are the basic components of the switchgear equipment or electrical substations. This article presents problems related to their operation. Inductive voltage transformers were exposed to specific working conditions in the form of ferroresonance oscillations with the participation of measurement and protective transformers. The disadvantage and negative significance of the phenomenon contributed to the development of the most convenient elimination methods, which is the main goal and achievement of the publication. The analysis of the proposed solutions were carried out on a theoretical model of a 30 kV power network model created and run in the Electromagnetic Transients Program/Alternative Transients Program (EMTP/ATP). The article presents several results of computer simulations carried out together with their complete characteristics (phase voltage waveforms on the primary side of voltage transformers), which allowed us to indicate the disadvantages and advantages of the solutions developed, and choose the most favorable methods to eliminate nonlinear oscillations. In the article, we present an analysis of all aspects contributing to the solution to the problem. This has permitted an appropriate conclusion to be made indicating the advantage of the method based on the use of a damping resistor in the open delta circuit compared to other solutions. Current solutions are largely based on a product using active variation of the resistance of an open delta attached resistor. The concept in this paper is based on a fixed resistance value, which is a different approach to the problem. By using a switch, the resistor is only connected when a fault occurs. Thanks to this solution, the secondary winding of the open delta is not additionally loaded (despite the very high resistance) at all times during the operation of the power network, as is the case with the available solution.",
