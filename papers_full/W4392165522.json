Cyber threats can take various forms,\nincluding malware, phishing, ransomware, DDoS\nattacks, social engineering, zero-day exploits, in-\nsider threats, and advanced persistent threats [1,\n2]. Adapting to these many threat types is criti-\ncal for protecting organizations and digital assets\nin an increasingly linked world [3]. Developing cy-\nber threat exercise scenarios is essential for the\nplanning process as it functions as both a train-\ning ground for security professionals and a test-\ning ground for system defenses. Constructing these\nscenarios, which require both authenticity and com-\nplexity, is a process that necessitates a detailed un-\nderstanding of the threat environment as well as\nthe capacity to predict the activities of possible\nadversaries. With organizations generating signif-\nicant volumes of data daily, there’s an increasing\nrisk that this data that could be used for malicious\nactivities, eﬀectively turning seemingly harmless\ninformation into a weapon for potentially breach-\ning security. Given this context, there is an ur-\ngent requirement to address novel approaches that\ncan convert this data into valuable training sce-\nnarios, thereby transforming potential weaknesses\ninto strong defenses [4]. Within this context, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) emerge as transforma-\ntive tools, oﬀering the ability to generate detailed\nand intricate content that can simulate potential\ncyber threat scenarios. Given their generative abil-\nities, LLMs can go beyond simulating known cyber\nthreat scenarios and have the potential to gener-\nate diﬀerent types of novel and sophisticated cyber\n2\nthreats, thus expanding the scope of cybersecurity\nawareness and training.\nIn this paper, we propose an innovative use of\nLLM hallucination to create a sophisticated and\nadaptive cyber threat scenario. Our approach trans-\nforms this hallucination into a useful tool for gen-\nerating diverse cyber threat exercise scenarios. We\nestablish a pipeline involving multiple LLMs that\ninteractively communicate, setting up a dynamic\nenvironment for cyber-attack scenarios. In this setup,\none LLM adopts the role of a ’Cyber Security Ex-\npert’, while the other acts as a ’CISO of an Orga-\nnization’. Uniquely, the ’CISO’ is aware of docu-\nments containing various organizational functions\nlike ﬁnance, HR, and IT infrastructure while the\n’Cyber Security Expert’ is aware of the current\ncyber threat landscape. The documents serve as\na prompt for the ’CISO’ to utilize its hallucina-\ntion capability in generating diﬀerent types of cy-\nber threats. This method not only capitalizes on\nthe often-overlooked hallucinatory aspect of LLMs\nbut also elevates it as a pivotal feature in craft-\ning realistic, adaptable, and comprehensive cyber\nthreat scenarios. This novel application of LLM\nhallucination in cybersecurity represents a signif-\nicant advancement, transforming a perceived lim-\nitation into a vital asset for strengthening digital\nsecurity infrastructures. Just like in Alan Turing’s\n”Imitation Game” where we have three characters\nan integrator and two individuals discussing a sub-\nject to identify who is a machine and who is a\nhuman. In our case we have predeﬁned prompts\nacting as interrogators while two LLMs discussing\nthe threat landscape for creating a cyber security\nscenario. We identiﬁed that our approach is suit-\nable for generating new and unique cybersecurity\nexercise scenarios and can have other potential use\ncases. The structure of the remainder of this paper\nis organized as follows: Section (2) reviews the cy-\nber security scenarios. Section (3) details the sce-\nnario design process. Section (4) is dedicated to\nthe proposed system design. Section (5) is based\non the case study. In the concluding phase, Sec-\ntion (6) concludes the paper and outlines future\nwork.\n2 Background and Related Work\n2.1 Cyber security scenarios\nThere are two primary types of cybersecurity exer-\ncises: tabletop discussions and hands-on operation-\nbased exercises [5–7]. Tabletop exercises involve\ndiscussions and are often conducted through sem-\ninars, workshops, and idea exchanges, primarily\nfocusing on policy-related issues. In comparison,\noperation-based cybersecurity training programs\nemphasize practical, hands-on activities aimed at\nenhancing participants’ technical skills and abili-\nties. These exercises take place in simulated, em-\nulated, physical, or hybrid practice environments.\nRecent studies have found that the creation of these\npractice environments, known as cyber-ranges, of-\nten relies on manual setup and conﬁguration. This\napproach is not only ineﬀective but also prone to\nerrors, making it a tedious process [8]. A similar\napproach was introduced by C. Chindrus et al. [9],\ntheir research study proposed a practical approach\nto enhancing cybersecurity readiness through a sim-\nulated ’Red’ and ’Blue’ cybersecurity competition.\nThe study assesses its impact on incident response\ncapabilities and cybersecurity skills development,\nemphasizing the value of immersive training expe-\nriences and knowledge exchange for proactive cy-\nbersecurity mindsets and cyber resilience [10].\nIn their study, M. Yamin et al. [11] developed\na serious game designed to enhance the develop-\nment of cyber-security exercise scenarios, address-\ning the ineﬃciencies in traditional exercise prepa-\nrations. Their study made use of a Domain Spe-\nciﬁc Language (DSL) and infrastructure coordina-\ntion which allows users to mimic real-time cyber-\nsecurity scenarios as attackers or defenders. This\napproach not only streamlines the scenario cre-\nation process but also allows for extensive test-\ning in a simulated environment before deployment\nin realistic settings. Their proposed method repre-\nsents a signiﬁcant advancement in cyber-security\ntraining, focusing on operational strategy devel-\nopment and eﬀective scenario modeling.\nR. Nakata et al. [12] introduced a Docker-based\ncyber range system, designed to address the grow-\ning need for eﬀective information security educa-\ntion by automatically generating multiple random-\nized scenarios using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)\ntechniques [13–15]. With the increasing reliance on\ninformation technology, the importance of cyber\nrange exercises in security training is highlighted.\nTraditional methods often suﬀer from the overuse\nof limited scenarios, which can reduce educational\nimpact due to predictability and information leak-\nage. CyExec* overcomes these challenges by pro-\nviding diverse, randomized scenarios that maintain\nthe same learning objectives, enhancing teaching\neﬀectiveness and mitigating the risk of cheating.\nCompared to VM-based systems, CyExec* demon-\nstrates signiﬁcant improvements in resource eﬃ-\nciency, using less memory, CPU, and storage, thus\nenabling more complex scenarios to be run simul-\n3\ntaneously. This paper has described the architec-\nture and eﬀectiveness of CyExec*, comparing it to\nexisting platforms, and discusses future enhance-\nments aimed at enriching scenario variety, online\nexercise application, and evaluating educational im-\npact.\nM. Yamin et al. [16] introduced an innovative\nsystem designed to address the ineﬃciencies in con-\nducting cyber-security exercises within cyber ranges\nafter conducting a detailed study on unclassiﬁed\ncyber-ranges [17]. It acknowledges the complexity\nand resource-intensive nature of current practices,\nwhich often fail to replicate the dynamic nature\nof real-world systems. To counter this, the authors\nintroduced an automated approach using model-\ndriven methods to streamline the cyber-security\nexercise life cycle. Their system models the roles\nof various teams such as White, Green, Red, and\nBlue, and generates automation artifacts to exe-\ncute these functions autonomously, adding real-\nism to the exercises. The system was evaluated\nthrough case studies involving national-level com-\npetitions and university classes in Norway, demon-\nstrating its ability to rapidly create complex in-\nfrastructures and improve participant skills. The\npaper addressed four key research questions focus-\ning on eﬃciency, adaptability, autonomy, and skill\nenhancement in cyber-security exercises.\nM. Yamin et al. [18] presented an advanced\nagent-based system for realistic and eﬃcient cyber-\nsecurity training, utilizing a newly developed for-\nmal model called the Execution Plan (EP) to au-\ntomate cyber attack and defense scenarios in cyber\nexercises. This approach addresses the challenges\nof involving human teams in large-scale cybersecu-\nrity exercises, which often lead to ineﬃciencies and\ninconsistencies. The system is evaluated through a\ncase study, demonstrating its eﬀectiveness in pro-\nviding realistic training environments. It also em-\nphasizes the use of domain-speciﬁc language for\nscenario modeling and the integration of various\ncyber exercise components, aiming to automate\nthe entire cybersecurity exercise life cycle. In their\nstudy, F. Lemjan et al. [19] investigated the secu-\nrity vulnerabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) de-\nvices, emphasizing the need for autonomous pene-\ntration testing to address these risks. The research\nexplores automated attack execution models for\nsimulating attacks in cyber ranges and applies these\nmodels to autonomously test IoT device security.\nA case study shows the eﬀectiveness of these mod-\nels in identifying known Wi-Fi vulnerabilities in\ncurrent IoT products. The study also highlights\nthe limitations and potential improvements in pen-\netration testing methodologies, such as network in-\nterface range and password cracking techniques,\nunderscoring the evolving nature of cybersecurity\nthreats and the need for continuously updated au-\ntomated testing tools. The research advocates for\nstronger security measures, like the adoption of\nWPA3 and robust password policies, to mitigate\nthe vulnerabilities found in widely used IoT de-\nvices.\nA. Zacharis et al. [20] described a novel method\nfor automating the creation of structured cyber-\nsecurity exercise scenarios. Their proposed work\nincluded Machine Learning (ML), more especially\nName Entity Recognition (NER), to evaluate un-\nstructured data and provide meaningful, structured\nscenarios for cybersecurity training. The document\ndescribes the creation and implementation of a\nunique ontology, the cyber exercise scenario on-\ntology, which aims to structure created content in\na way that is both machine and human-readable.\nTheir research methodology intends to increase the\nspeed, quality, and relevance of cybersecurity exer-\ncise scenarios scenario development, primarily aid-\ning exercise planners with little experience in sce-\nnario building. These exercises are crucial in en-\nabling IT professionals and cybersecurity teams\nto eﬀectively prevent and mitigate cyber threats.\nThe methodology being explored intends to im-\nprove these training modules by proposing a novel\ntechnique for creating cyber exercise content. This\nstrategy uses AI and machine learning technology\nto create situations that are detailed, technically\nsound, realistic, and imaginative. However, this re-\nsearch study’s proposed framework AI-Assisted Cy-\nber Exercise Content Generation Framework using\nNamed Entity Recognition (AiCEF) has certain\nlimitations, such as the need to expand the range\nof data sources, including threat intelligence re-\nports and alerts, to enhance scenario generation\nwithin AiCEF. Moreover, reﬁning the text synthe-\nsis mechanism to exclusively utilize cybersecurity-\nspeciﬁc resources would improve the accuracy of\ntechnical terminologies. Additionally, the threat\nactor description component of AiCEF requires\ntargeted enhancements to more eﬀectively address\nthe intricate dynamics of cybersecurity threats. By\nusing basic AI, the method may not fully capture\nthe nuanced dynamics of cyber threats and oper-\national challenges, emphasizing the need for more\nadvanced solutions like LLMs to enhance scenario\ndevelopment with greater creativity and intricacy.\n4\n2.2 LLMs\nIn the ﬁeld of Machine Learning (ML), the prac-\ntice of initially training models on general tasks\nand then ﬁne-tuning them for speciﬁc applications\nhas been a well-established technique in 2010, par-\nticularly in computer vision. However, signiﬁcant\nadoption of this method began in the latter half\nof the decade, with the development of the Trans-\nformer architecture [21,22]. The advent of the Trans-\nformer model revolutionized the ﬁeld of Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) by addressing some\nof the key limitations of previous architectures,\nsuch as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Un-\nlike RNNs that process data sequentially, Trans-\nformers parallelize the computations, which signif-\nicantly speeds up training. RNNs heavily relied on\npredicting the next word based on the previous\none, often leading to inaccurate predictions. The\nself-attention mechanism of a Transformer allows\neach position in the encoder to attend to all po-\nsitions in the previous layer of the encoder, simi-\nlarly for the decoder enabling the model to capture\nlong-range dependencies with ease [23, 24]. Build-\ning upon the Transformer architecture, pre-trained\nmodels such as Bidirectional Encoder Represen-\ntations from Transformers (BERT) and Genera-\ntive Pretrained Transformers (GPT) represent the\nclass of LLMs. These LLMs are trained on massive\namounts of data, learning a rich representation of\nlanguage that captures a wide spectrum of linguis-\ntic patterns, idioms, and structures. They excel\nover prior models by being adept at a wide range\nof tasks without task-speciﬁc architecture modiﬁ-\ncations, largely due to their extensive pretraining,\nwhich imparts a broad understanding of language.\nThis pretraining aspect allows them to be ﬁne-\ntuned for speciﬁc tasks with relatively little addi-\ntional data, making them highly versatile and pow-\nerful tools for NLP applications. LLMs are used in\nchatbots, virtual assistants, and customer service\nautomation to understand and generate human-\nlike responses [25] [26]. These advanced language\nmodels also assist in writing articles, generating\ncreative content, and summarizing texts [27] [28].\nThe mechanism of self-attention within the Trans-\nformer can be mathematically formulated as fol-\nlows:\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK⊤\ni\n√ dk\n)Vi (1)\nwhere:\nQ: is the loss to minimize\nK: is the key matrix\nV : is the value matrix\ndk: is the dimension of the key vectors\nN: is the length of the input sequence\ni: is the index of the query vector\nLLMs represent a signiﬁcant leap in Artiﬁcial\nIntelligence (AI) capabilities, having been trained\non trillions of words over extensive periods using\nconsiderable computational resources. The expan-\nsive parameter sets in these models endow them\nwith extensive ’memory’, allowing them to tackle\nincreasingly complex tasks. While LLMs are pow-\nerful out-of-the-box tools, their full potential can\nbe utilized through ﬁne-tuning, which adapts them\nto particular tasks beyond their initial training\nscope. LLMs excel at interpreting natural language\ninstructions and executing tasks with a proﬁciency\ncomparable to human performance [29–32]. The\ninput text provided to an LLM serves as a ’ prompt’\nwithin what is known as the ’ context window’\nthe active ﬁeld where the model processes infor-\nmation. Utilizing LLMs to generate text, a pro-\ncess termed ’inference,’ relies on the foundational\ntechnique of next-word prediction, which supports\nmany of their diverse text-generating tasks [33–36].\nIn the context of LLMs, the term ’ completion’\nsigniﬁes the output generated, which may encom-\npass more than just single-word predictions and\noften constitutes full sentences or even paragraphs\nin response to given prompts.\nThrough ﬁne-tuning and the prompt engineer-\ning, LLMs can be informed about speciﬁc tasks\nthat are not covered during pretraining, thus em-\npowering them to interact eﬀectively with real-\nworld scenarios. It is within the multitude of pa-\nrameters that LLMs encapsulate their understand-\ning of language, enabling them to analyze, deduce,\nand resolve the challenges presented to them. In\naddition to their impressive capabilities, it’s im-\nportant to acknowledge that LLMs are not with-\nout their limitations. One notable concern is the\npotential for hallucination, where they generate in-\nformation that is not grounded in reality or might\npropagate false or misleading content. We utilised\nthis feature of LLMs in our study to provide them\ncontext of cybersecuirty scenarios through prompt\nengineering.\n5\n2.3 Hallucination in LLMs\nHallucination in LLMs is an issue that arises due\nto the vast amount of data they have been trained\non, which may include inaccuracies or biased in-\nformation, this issue emerges as a result of the\nmodel’s capacity to generate text that adheres to\nlearned patterns from its training data, even when\nthe generated content diverges from reality [37]\nand this phenomenon could pose serious risks in\ndiverse ﬁelds, including law and medical consul-\ntation, potentially leading to disasters. Address-\ning and mitigating the risk of hallucination is an\nongoing challenge in the development and deploy-\nment of LLMs, requiring careful monitoring, ethi-\ncal guidelines, and continuous reﬁnement of their\nalgorithms and training data. One of the various\nreasons for hallucination in LLMs, as identiﬁed by\n[38], is that nonsensical Out-of-Distribution (OoD)\nprompts, composed of random tokens, can also elicit\nhallucinatory responses from these language mod-\nels. Some methods to minimize hallucination in-\nclude SELFCHECKGPT [39], robust instruction\ntuning [40], knowledge injection [41], self-reﬂection\nmechanisms [42], and contrastive learning [43]. While\nhallucination in LLMs is often regarded as a limita-\ntion and potential source of misinformation, there\nare several situations in which it could be advan-\ntageous if used correctly. Controlled hallucination\ncan serve as a valuable tool in various creative and\nexploratory contexts. For instance, LLMs can be\nused to generate imaginative and creative content,\nsuch as ﬁction, poetry, or art descriptions, push-\ning the boundaries of traditional human creativ-\nity [44–46]. This kind of creativity is required for\ngenerating new and unique cybersecuirty exercises\nscenarios and LLMs hallucination can play an im-\nportant role in it.\n3 Scenario Design Process\nTaking inspiration from eLuna [47] game design\nprocess we theorized to use the same approach to\ncreate scenarios for cybersecurity exercises. The\neLuna framework exempliﬁes a methodical brain-\nstorming process tailored for the collaborative de-\nsign of narrative Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL)\nexperiences. It facilitates a creative dialogue be-\ntween educators and game developers, employing\na visual language to articulate and merge edu-\ncational objectives with engaging gameplay ele-\nments. In the initial co-design phase, this brain-\nstorming approach allows for the ﬂexible integra-\ntion of diverse ideas, nurturing an innovative envi-\nronment that captures the educational intent within\nthe game’s narrative. As the process transitions\nto the co-speciﬁcation phase, the brainstorming\nbecomes more structured, converging towards a\ndetailed and technical blueprint that guides the\ngame’s development. LLMs can signiﬁcantly en-\nhance this brainstorming activity by generating\nrich, context-aware content that aligns with the\nestablished educational themes, thereby enriching\nthe narrative depth and bolstering the learning ex-\nperience [ ?]. By leveraging the generative capabil-\nities of LLMs, the eLuna Framework can produce\nDGBL solutions that are not only captivating and\neducational but also infused with the creative in-\nsights obtained from a comprehensive brainstorm-\ning process. Furthermore, in the ﬁelds of art and\nmusic composition, controlled hallucination can re-\nsult in the creation of one-of-a-kind and innova-\ntive works oﬀering a fresh perspective that might\nresonate with certain audiences. In cybersecurity\nexercises, we have a scenario design process with\nvarious phases: preparation, dry run, execution,\nevaluation, and repetition. In this work we focused\non the preparation phase of cybersecuirty exercises\nscenarios and use similar conpets to eluna to de-\nscribe requirements for cyberscuirty exercises sce-\nnarios.\n3.1 Preparation\nIn the ”preparation” phase of the scenario design\nprocess, we have six crucial modules including story,\nentity, infrastructure, conditions, events, and TLO’s.\nFigure 1 represents the all steps in the preparation\nphase which has been discussed in detail below.\n1. Story: The story of a cybersecurity exercise\nsets the ﬁctional backdrop and events for the\nscenario. In cybersecurity exercises, the main\nstory sets the overall context, such as a cyber-\nattack on a ﬁnancial institution. Sub-stories,\nwhich detail related incidents like internal net-\nwork breaches or customer data theft, support\nand elaborate on the main story, adding depth\nand complexity to the scenario. These sub-stories\n(scripts), may also include incidents like at-\ntacks on third-party vendors. The story can be\nbroken down into diﬀerent scripts, each con-\ntaining a series of events that form a narrative.\nEach script presents a part of the story from\nthe viewpoint of one or more entities. A story\nalso has an internal speed that governs the ex-\n6\nFig. 1: Preparation Architecture\nercise’s overall pace with an optional descrip-\ntion1.\n2. Scripts : Scripts are the sub-stories that dic-\ntate the timeline of a cybersecurity exercise,\nwith a start and end time expressed in seconds,\nand a speed indicating how quickly the script\nprogresses. Events within the script are sched-\nuled to start at precise times, such as ’event-1’\nat the outset and ’event-2’ ﬁve minutes later.\n3. Events :Events serve as sets of rules that out-\nline speciﬁc conditions. When these conditions\nbecome valid, the associated injects within that\nevent are activated. Events involve the actions\nof attackers, the responses of characters or or-\nganizations, and the injection of challenges into\nthe scenario. They serve to comprehensively as-\nsess participants’ response capabilities. In Deputy,\nthe ”Source” attribute speciﬁes the package con-\ntaining an Event markdown ﬁle, which subse-\nquently gets transformed into HTML and pre-\nsented to participants upon the event’s activa-\ntion.\n4. Injects :Injects are speciﬁc actions that unfold\nwithin the narrative of an exercise scenario,\nserving as catalysts for various script develop-\nments. They can take various forms, from exe-\ncuting cyberattacks between entities to dissem-\ninating information through a simulated news\nbroadcast. The origin of these actions is de-\nﬁned by the ’Source’, which identiﬁes where\nthe inject’s command is executed. Each inject\nis aligned with Terminal Learning Objectives\n(TLOs) and associated capabilities, which in-\nclude a primary executive function and, op-\ntionally, additional supportive capabilities. For\n1https://documentation.opencyberrange.ee/docs/\nsdl/reference\nricher context, injects may include descriptive\nannotations. Furthermore, the ’Environment’\nparameter details the necessary variables to fa-\ncilitate the execution of Deputy packages. While\nthe ’from-entity’ and ’to-entities’ ﬁelds are not\nfunctional in the current parsing mechanism,\nthey hold potential for utilization in scenarios\nsuch as tabletop exercises.\n5. Conditions : Conditions in cybersecurity ex-\nercises include a set of tools that are linked\nto Virtual Machines (VMs) and used to moni-\ntor their status. Installed during feature setup,\nthey report a status value ranging from 0 to 1,\nwhich is used for scoring and triggering events.\nEach condition has a unique name and requires\neither a periodic command or a deﬁned source.\nWhen completely stated, the command and ex-\necution frequency take precedence over the source.\nConditions can also include environment vari-\nables 2.\n– Command : This command provides the\nﬁle path to the executable and yields a ﬂoating-\npoint value ranging from 0 to 1. The ”in-\nterval” parameter speciﬁes the time gap, in\nseconds, between successive command exe-\ncutions.\n– Source : The ”source” ﬁeld speciﬁes the\nidentity and version of the image ﬁle or pack-\nage stored in the Digital Library.\n6. Infrastructure : Infrastructure includes both\nthe physical and virtual components linked to\ndiﬀerent entities, along with the vulnerabilities\nexisting within them. Characters and organi-\nzations need to establish conditions governing\n2https://documentation.opencyberrange.ee/docs/\ndeputy/\n7\ntheir responses to potential attacks. These con-\nditions encompass elements such as detection\nmechanisms, available tools, requisite skills, and\ngranted authority. Each entity needs to possess\ncapabilities that align with their designated roles\nwithin the scenario.\n– Count : The count value indicates the de-\nsired number of VMs and switches to be\nutilized.\n– Dependencies : Dependencies comprise a\nlist of VMs that rely on other nodes. A VM\ncan establish connections with none, one, or\nmultiple nodes. In practical terms, this de-\ntermines the order in which nodes are de-\nployed.\n– Links : Links are a list of switches that are\ndependent upon other nodes.\n7. TLOs : TLOs explain an individual’s speciﬁc\ntraining objectives, which include the skills and\ncapabilities that they are expected to achieve\nduring the exercise. Each TLO has a name and\na written description. The ”Evaluation” ele-\nment assigns a value to assess the TLO’s achieve-\nment, and the TLO’s scope can be further de-\nﬁned by an optional list of associated capabili-\nties.\n8. Evaluation: The Evaluation block outlines the\nevaluation criteria for a TLO. Within this block,\nthere are three key components:\n– Description: This provides a textual de-\nscription of the evaluation criteria.\n– Metrics: This comprises a list of speciﬁc\nmetrics used to assess the TLO’s achieve-\nment.\n– Min-score: This represents the minimum\nscore that an individual must achieve for\nthe TLO to be considered complete.\n4 System Design\nOur system design is based on generating cyber ex-\nercise scenarios using two LLMs in parallel. LLM1\nacts as the Chief Information Security Oﬃcer (CISO)\nof the organization and possesses knowledge about\nthe organization, while the second LLM is a se-\ncurity expert well-informed about the current cy-\nber environment 3. Both LLMs operate within the\nbounds of their rationality and pre-trained knowl-\nedge. Furthermore, these LLMs have been conﬁg-\nured with a RAG technique to generate more re-\nalistic scenarios.\n3https://mitre.org/news-insights/publication/\ncyber-exercise-playbook\n4.1 Bounded Rationality\nHerbert A. Simon introduced the concept of bounded\nrationality, which questions the idea of humans\nmaking purely rational decisions 4. This theory posits\nthat individuals operate within three inherent lim-\nitations:\n1. Limited Information: Individuals do not have\naccess to all information in their environment.\nThey are limited by the amount and accuracy\nof the information they have. Apart from envi-\nronmental limitations, individuals’ backgrounds,\nexperiences, and perceptual biases play signiﬁ-\ncant roles in determining the information they\nseek out and rely on. This selective exposure\ncan result in what is referred to as ’bounded ra-\ntionality,’ wherein decision-making occurs within\nthe conﬁnes of an individual’s understanding\nand cognitive capacity.\n2. Limited Cognitive Capacity: Individuals have\na limited capacity for processing information\nand cannot realistically grasp all possible al-\nternatives or consequences when making deci-\nsions. Cognitive constraints may prompt the\nadoption of heuristic mental shortcuts, which\ncan be eﬃcient but also prone to errors. The\nimpact of cognitive load is signiﬁcant in com-\nplex tasks where the individual must hold mul-\ntiple pieces of information in working memory\nwhile attempting to discern relevant patterns\nor implications.\n3. Limited Time: Individuals must make deci-\nsions within certain time constraints, meaning\nthey cannot always analyze every option thor-\noughly. The advantage of having more time per-\nmits a more comprehensive collection of infor-\nmation and analysis, leading to more deliberate\ndecisions. Nevertheless, in high-speed scenar-\nios, the necessity to respond swiftly can often\noutweigh the need for detailed analysis, result-\ning in decisions that are practical rather than\nthorough.\n4.2 Retrieval Augmented Generation\nRAG is a strategy used in LLMs to improve the\nmodel’s ability to oﬀer accurate and detailed infor-\nmation by combining the retrieval of relevant texts\nfrom a large corpus with LLM creation capabili-\nties. This method ﬁrst retrieves a list of documents\nthat are likely to contain information relevant to a\n4https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/\nbounded-rationality/\n8\nFig. 2: Excercise Design Framework with LLMs\nquery. Then, it uses these papers as extra context\nto generate a response, to improve the output’s\nquality and relevancy. In our study, both LLMs\nare conﬁgured with their respective RAG environ-\nments and are also subject to bounded rationality.\nWe have utilized Llama-2 5, a model boasting 13\nbillion parameters, for the creation of cybersecu-\nrity exercise scenarios. The following list 1 displays\nthe prompt which was given to launch the ﬁrst\niteration. Along with this prompt, RAG will be\nconﬁgured with LLMs to create realistic cyberse-\ncurity exercise scenarios. If the LLMs do not have\nan answer based on the provided context, the in-\nstruction ’make up an answer’ will prompt them\nto generate a relevant scenario that highlights po-\ntential hallucinations.\n5https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b\nListing 1: Prompt Based Instruction Fine-Tuning\nwith RAG\ntemplate = \"\"\"Use the following pieces of context to answer t he question at the\nend.֒→\nIf you don't know the answer, make up an answer.

Unlike the common transformer models that\ndefault to a greedy decoding strategy selecting the\n9\nmost probable next word, we employed advanced\ntext generation strategies for a more authentic out-\nput. Speciﬁcally, we used techniques such as top-\nk and top-p sampling, which introduce controlled\nrandomness to enhance the output’s creativity and\nvariability [48] [49].\nTop-k sampling involves choosing the k highest\nprobability words from the model’s distribution as\ncandidates for the next word in the sequence. The\nformula is as follows:\nP (w) =\n{ e(P (w)\n∑\nw′ e(P (w′) if w is in the top- k\n0 otherwise\n(2)\nwhere:\nw: is the word being sampled,\nP (w): is the probability of word,\nV : is the vocabulary of possible words.\nTop-p sampling, also known as nucleus sampling,\nselects the smallest set of words whose combined\nprobability surpasses a predetermined threshold p.\nThis method is deﬁned by the following mathemat-\nical formula [50]:\nP (w) = 1\n∑\nw′∈V :P (w′)≥p P (w′) (3)\nwhere:\n∑\nw′∈V :P (w′)≥p\nP (w′): sum of probabilities\nFurthermore, we integrated an additional set of\nconﬁguration options into our methodology, specif-\nically the ”temperature” parameter. This param-\neter signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the model’s calculated\nprobability distribution for the upcoming token\nprediction. Acting as a scaling mechanism within\nthe softmax layer of the transformer models, the\ntemperature value modulates the degree of ran-\ndomness in the output. Elevating the temperature\nparameter enhances the diversity in the output by\nincreasing randomness, whereas diminishing the\ntemperature narrows down the selection of poten-\ntial words, leading to more predictable text. This\nﬂexibility allows us to achieve the desired balance\nbetween creativity and coherence in our scenario\ndevelopment [51] [48].\nFollowing is the mathematical expression for ran-\ndom sampling with temperature [50],\nP (w) = exp(P (w)/τ )\n∑\nw′ exp(P (w′)/τ ) (4)\nwhere:\nτ: temperature parameter controlling distribution\n∑\nw′\nexp(P (w′)/τ ): normalization factor\nTable 1 provides an overview of the hyperparame-\nters employed during the ﬁne-tuning of our models,\nincluding details on class type and the tokenizer\nused.\nTable 1: Hyperparameter and Conﬁguration De-\ntails\nmodel temp top-k top-p\nLLM1 1 5 0.3\nLLM2 1 3 0.5\nThe CISO LLM received a prompt accompanied by\nPDF ﬁles, serving the purpose of conﬁguring the\nRAG, whereas LLM2 received the prompt along\nwith a cybersecurity handbook.\n4.3.1 CISO LLM\nThe bounded rationality of this LLM, enhanced\nby RAG, is deﬁned by its speciﬁc pre-training on\norganizational knowledge, complemented by dy-\nnamic retrieval of relevant, up-to-date organiza-\ntional documents. While its decision-making and\noutputs are tailored to the scope of its initial train-\ning data and programmed understanding of orga-\nnizational roles, infrastructure, and objectives, the\nRAG component allows it to incorporate the latest\norganizational documents and data into its narra-\ntive generation. This integration ensures the pro-\nduced story prompt and subsequent narrative de-\ntails are not only relevant and speciﬁc to the orga-\nnization but also reﬂect the most current context.\nThe following list 2 represents the context role of\nCISO LLMs.\nListing 2: CISO LLM Context\nFROM llama2-uncensored\nPARAMETER temperature 1\nSYSTEM \"\"\"\nAs the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of our Smal l to Medium-sized\nEnterprise (SME), I am dedicated to initiating and overseei ng cybersecurity\nexercises within our organization.

The iterative process between the two mod-\nels enables the creation of advanced and adaptive\nexercises, taking into account both the distinctive\nfeatures of the organization and the latest devel-\nopments in the cybersecurity ﬁeld. These sections\nhighlight how the Retrieve and Generate approach\nenhances the capabilities of each LLM, allowing\nthem to draw on both their pre-trained knowledge\nand dynamically retrieved information to generate\nmore accurate, relevant, and contextually rich cy-\nbersecurity scenarios.\n4.4 LLM-Based Cyber Exercise Design\nFramework\nOur developed framework, as depicted in Figure\n2, employs two distinct LLMs in a RAG (Retrieve\nand Generate) approach: LLM1, acting as a CISO\nwith organizational knowledge, and LLM2, serving\nas a ’Cyber Security Expert’ well-versed in the cur-\nrent cyber landscape, including CISA guidelines.\nThe CISO LLM (LLM1) initiates the exercise with\na story prompt based on a deep understanding\nof the organization’s unique context. This setup\nhighlights the current security state and potential\nthreat scenarios. LLM1 crafts this initial narrative,\nwhich LLM2 then reﬁnes by applying established\ncyber security frameworks to formulate a detailed\nand actionable cyber exercise narrative. This iter-\native process results in a clear, actionable story,\noutlining speciﬁc threats and a sequence of inci-\ndents for the exercise.\nIn the second iteration, LLM1 expands the sce-\nnario by integrating characters and agents reﬂect-\ning the organization’s roles and responsibilities.\nLLM2 assigns speciﬁc tasks to these entities within\nthe exercise context, ensuring actions align with\nthe organization’s policies and the broader train-\ning objectives. As the narrative progresses, LLM1\ndetails the organization’s infrastructure, laying out\nthe technological framework and security mea-\nsures. LLM2 then crafts the virtual environment\nfor the exercise, mirroring the actual infrastruc-\nture to provide a realistic setting for scenario en-\nactment.\nIn the fourth iteration, the ’Events and In-\njects Prompt’ prompts LLM1 to introduce var-\nious planned events and spontaneous ’injects’,\nemulating the unpredictability of real cyber in-\ncidents. LLM2 incorporates these elements, cre-\nating dynamic challenges that test participants’\ndecision-making and adaptability. Finally, the\n’TLOs Prompt’ has LLM1 deﬁne the Training\nand Learning Objectives (TLOs), identifying de-\nsired skills and knowledge outcomes. LLM2 en-\nsures the exercise’s design and content align with\nthese TLOs, facilitating measurable improvement\nin cybersecurity capabilities.\n4.5 Evaluation Methodology\nTo objectively assess the eﬀectiveness and educa-\ntional value of the cyber exercise scenarios gen-\nerated by LLM1 and LLM2, we employ a multi-\ndimensional evaluation framework. This frame-\nwork consists of six key criteria: Details, Technical\nSoundness, Realism, Creativity, Usability in Exer-\ncises, and Expandability with Human Inputs. Each\ncriterion is assigned a value between 0 to 5, where 0\nrepresents the minimum and 5 the maximum score,\nto quantify the scenarios’ attributes comprehen-\nsively. These factors ensure that exercises are real-\nistic, engaging, and technically accurate, reﬂecting\nthe complexity of real-world cyber threats. They\nenrich the creativity, encouraging learners to think\ncritically and innovatively. Usability ensures exer-\n11\ncises are accessible and beneﬁcial for a wide range\nof users, while expandability with human inputs\nallows for continuous updates and relevance in a\nrapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape. The six\ncrucial criteria have been utilized for evaluating\nboth scenarios, whereby we assessed them with the\nguidance of security experts (Human Evaluators)\nand also employed the GPT model for evaluation.\nSubsequently, we validated our ﬁndings to ensure\na comprehensive assessment and robust results.\n1. Details: Details are the precision and speci-\nﬁcity in the generated cyber exercise scenarios,\nensuring that they accurately reﬂect the com-\nplexity of real-world cybersecurity threats and\nincidents.\n2. Technical Soundness: The extent to which\nthe generated cyber threat scenarios are built\non cybersecurity concepts and accurately rep-\nresent the technological aspects of cyber\nthreats, vulnerabilities, and defenses.\n3. Realism: Realism is the incorporation of ac-\ncurate, contemporary cyber threat environ-\nment and attack methodologies into the sce-\nnarios, ensuring they mirror the intricacies and\nunpredictability of actual cybersecurity inci-\ndents. This aspect demands the scenarios to\nbe grounded in current cyber threat intelli-\ngence, including the latest vulnerabilities, at-\ntack vectors, and threat actor tactics, tech-\nniques, and procedures (TTPs). Realism en-\nhances the training’s eﬀectiveness by providing\nparticipants with experiences that closely sim-\nulate real-world challenges, preparing them to\nrespond more eﬀectively to actual cybersecu-\nrity incidents.\n4. Creativity: Creativity can be deﬁned as the\nframework’s ability to generate novel and var-\nied scenarios that go beyond standard or pre-\nviously known cybersecurity incidents, encour-\naging innovative thinking and responses.\n5. Usability in Exercises: The practicality and\neﬀectiveness of the generated scenarios in cy-\nbersecurity training exercises, including how\neasily they can be integrated into training ses-\nsions and understood by participants.\n6. Expandability with Human Inputs: The\ncapability of the framework to incorporate\nexpert feedback and real-world developments\ninto the scenario generation process, allowing\nfor continuous improvement and adaptation to\nemerging cyber threats.\n5 Case study\nIn this case study, we included listings depict-\ning scenarios created by Large Language Models\n(LLMs), following the design outlined in Figure\n1. We assessed the performance of LLMs across\nvarious dimensions, including primary narratives,\nscripts, characters, infrastructure, and events. Ad-\nditionally, this study aims to understand the depth\nand versatility of LLMs in generating complex and\ndetailed scenarios. We used our developed artifact\nto generate 2 scenarios and evaluated them based\non expert feedback and other LLM models.\n5.1 Scenario 1\nScenario 1 employs a complex cyber exercise to\nassess Electronic Empire’s preparedness against\na diverse set of cyber threats, following the\nSmartHome product launch. The methodology in-\ntegrates real-world cyber threat simulations, in-\ncluding email compromise, malware attacks, in-\nsider threats, DDoS, ransomware, cyber espi-\nonage, data loss, and unauthorized access inci-\ndents. This scenario tests the company’s inci-\ndent response strategies, technical defense capa-\nbilities, and decision-making processes, involving\nroles such as Incident Responders, SOC Analysts,\nSecurity Engineers, and the CISO, to foster a\nhands-on understanding of navigating a multi-\nthreat cybersecurity landscape.\n5.2 Scenario 2\nScenario 2 involves a ﬁnance company targeted by\nan APT group, leading to unauthorized data ma-\nnipulation and exﬁltration over months. The in-\ncident response team, comprising security experts\nfrom IT, legal, and compliance, faces challenges in-\ncluding an insider threat, data exﬁltration, a ran-\nsomware attack, regulatory compliance issues, and\nstakeholder management. This scenario is designed\nto test the organization’s ability to contain ad-\nvanced threats, secure sensitive ﬁnancial informa-\ntion, ensure regulatory compliance, and manage\nstakeholder communication eﬀectively.\n5.3 Generated Scenario\nIn the following list 4 ”main story”, upon dis-\ncovering the unauthorized access by an advanced\npersistent threat (APT) group, our incident re-\nsponse team, composed of specialists from IT, le-\n12\ngal, and compliance, immediately enacted con-\ntainment measures.

Fol-\nlowing are the evaluation rankings for scenario 1\nand scenario 2 achieved by both LLMs and also\nfrom human evaluators (experts).\n5.4.1 Evaluation for Scenarios by Expert 1\nThe scores provided by two cybersecurity experts\nfor Scenarios, generated by LLM1 and LLM2, re-\nﬂect their diverse perspectives shaped by their ex-\nperience. In the evaluation of both scenarios, ex-\npert 1, with an extensive background of 30 years,\nincluding 25 in IT security, oﬀers a critical view,\nappreciating the scenario’s detail but noting a lack\n14\nof coherent design and realism, especially concern-\ning modern organizational and technological con-\ntexts. This expert sees potential oversaturation\nwith high-impact events and questions its usability\ndue to reliance on licensed tools. These evaluations\nhighlight the scenario’s strengths in detail and cre-\nativity, alongside areas for improvement in realism\nand coherence.\nThe following ﬁgure 3 visualizes the evaluation of\nboth scenarios by Experts.\nFig. 3: Evaluation by Expert 1\n5.4.2 Evaluation for Scenarios by Expert 2\nExpert 2, with a more focused 5 years in cyberse-\ncurity exercises, rates the scenarios higher in cre-\nativity, usability, and expandability, suggesting a\npositive reception of its innovative approach and\nadaptability for training purposes. The evaluations\nfor both scenarios by Expert 1 view them as highly\ndetailed but criticize technical coherence and real-\nism, suggesting they might not accurately reﬂect\norganizational capabilities and may have limited\ndirect applicability in exercises without further de-\nvelopment. In contrast, Expert 2 gives high marks\nacross the board, particularly praising its realism,\ntechnical soundness, and creativity, indicating a\nbelief that the scenario oﬀers a highly realistic and\nengaging training tool that is both usable and ex-\npandable. This contrast highlights the subjective\nnature of evaluating the utility and eﬀectiveness of\ncybersecurity scenarios, underscoring the value of\nincorporating a range of expert feedback in their\ndevelopment and reﬁnement.\nThe following ﬁgure 4 visualizes the evaluation of\nboth scenarios by Experts.\nFig. 4: Evaluation by Expert 2\n5.4.3 Evaluation for Scenarios 1 using LLMs\nBased on the content and context of Scenario 1\ngenerated by LLM1 and LLM2, here are the rank-\nings across the speciﬁed criteria:\n1. Details: 4 - The scenario is richly detailed, cov-\nering a wide array of cyber threats and im-\nplications for the company, showcasing a deep\nunderstanding of potential cyber security inci-\ndents.\n2. Technical Soundness: 5 - The technical aspects\nof the scenario are sound, reﬂecting a realistic\nunderstanding of cybersecurity threats, defense\nmechanisms, and the complexities of respond-\ning to incidents.\n3. Realism: 4 - This scenario is highly realis-\ntic, mirroring the multifaceted nature of cyber\nthreats that companies face today, including\ninsider threats, malware, and DDoS attacks,\nwhich are common in real-world cyber inci-\ndents.\n4. Creativity: 3 - While the scenario is compre-\nhensive and well-constructed, its creativity is\nmoderate as it follows familiar patterns of cy-\nbersecurity exercises. The inclusion of diverse\nthreats is expected but crucial for comprehen-\nsive training.\n5. Usability in Exercises: 5 - Its detailed and real-\nistic approach makes it highly usable for cyber-\nsecurity training exercises, providing a practi-\ncal framework for incident response teams to\npractice and reﬁne their skills.\n6. Expandability with Human Inputs: 4 - The sce-\nnario allows for signiﬁcant expandability with\nhuman inputs, oﬀering a solid foundation that\ncan be adapted and expanded based on evolv-\ning cybersecurity threats and company-speciﬁc\nneeds.\n15\n5.4.4 Evaluation for Scenario 2 using LLMs\nBased on the evaluation framework previously dis-\ncussed for Scenario 1, here are the anticipated\nscores for Scenario 2, considering a general under-\nstanding of such cybersecurity scenarios:\n1. Details: 5 - Assuming Scenario 2 is as intri-\ncately designed as Scenario 1, it should oﬀer\na comprehensive exploration of cybersecurity\nissues relevant to its context, likely providing\nextensive detail on attack vectors, defensive\nstrategies, and the roles involved in mitigating\ncyber threats.\n2. Technical Soundness: 4 - Given the necessity for\naccuracy in depicting cybersecurity challenges,\nespecially in a potentially complex sector like\nﬁnance, the scenario is expected to exhibit a\nhigh level of technical soundness, showcasing\nan understanding of both existing and emerg-\ning cyber threats.\n3. Realism: 4 - The ﬁnance sector’s unique vul-\nnerabilities to cyber-attacks, including sophis-\nticated threats like APTs, phishing, and insider\nthreats, suggest that Scenario 2 would priori-\ntize realism, reﬂecting the nuanced and high-\nstakes environment of ﬁnancial cybersecurity.\n4. Creativity: 3 - Creativity in such scenarios is of-\nten demonstrated through the innovative pre-\nsentation of threats and problem-solving ap-\nproaches. However, the balance between cre-\nativity and realism is crucial to maintain the\nscenario’s educational value without straying\ntoo far from plausible threats.\n5. Usability in Exercises: 4 - The practical appli-\ncation of the scenario in training exercises is\nvital. A scenario that eﬀectively simulates real-\nworld challenges while allowing participants to\npractice their response strategies would score\nhighly in usability.\n6. Expandability with Human Inputs: 4 - The\nability to adapt and expand the scenario based\non new information, threats, and organiza-\ntional changes is essential for keeping cyber-\nsecurity exercises relevant and engaging, sug-\ngesting a high score for expandability.\nThe following ﬁgure 5 visualizes the evaluation of\nboth scenarios by LLM1 and LLM2.\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis study demonstrates that using LLMs to cre-\nate cybersecurity exercise scenarios is both inno-\nvative and eﬀective for training. The methodology\nFig. 5: Evaluation by LLMs\neﬀectively prepares security professionals to tackle\na broad spectrum of cyber threats by simulating\nreal-world challenges, encompassing both familiar\nand emerging cybersecurity issues. The integration\nof RAG adds depth and relevance to the scenar-\nios, eﬀectively utilizing LLM-generated content for\nmore authentic simulations. Despite the critical\nscores in scenario 1, the overall quantitative mea-\nsures provided us with good results. Future work\nshould focus on further reﬁning the integration of\nLLMs into cybersecurity training programs, par-\nticularly by expanding parameter coverage (LLMs\nwith larger parameters) for more detailed scenar-\nios and implementing generative conﬁgurations for\nincreased creativity which will also assess the real-\nworld impact of these scenarios on enhancing cy-\nbersecurity skills and readiness.\nDeclarations\n1.
