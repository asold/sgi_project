In North America, that is the case for the Paleoindian Clovis culture (ca. 13,000–\n12,700 cal. BP), where most Clovis artifacts are stone tools [1:1, 2]. Using two-dimensional\nlandmark-based geometric morphometrics (LGM), we examine aspects of Clovis points from\ninitial manufacture to ultimate discard or loss. Whether projectile armature or knife or both\n[2, 3], the Clovis point garners outsized attention and focus.

We start the\ninquiry on a significant feature of Clovis points in the archaeological record: Whether the\nshapes and sizes of points and their component parts (proximal hafts and distal blades)\nchanged from initial design through discard or loss, and if so, how that change can be under-\nstood in functional and life-history contexts. In short, we examine whether Clovis points were\nsubject to the phenomena of allometry, modularity, and integration from our dataset of 100\npoints collected from cache (n = 26) and non-cache (n = 74) sites west of the Mississippi River\n(Tables 1 and S1 and S1 Fig). Caches are special Clovis site types, such as burials or provision-\ning loci, that “consist of artifacts or materials in useful condition and forms that appear to have\nbeen set aside for later use” [4:1, 5].\nAllometry is discussed in more detail below, but succinctly: if an artifact shape changes\nnon-uniformly as its size changes, such as resharpening just the blade of a point but leaving its\nhaft unchanged, the change is allometric (Fig 1C). If a tool’s shape changes uniformly with\nchanges in its size, perhaps by resharpening and reworking the tool around its circumference,\nthe two-dimensional shape-change is isometric (Fig 1A) [48]. Allometric effects can manifest\nas a change in the entire shape or the relative proportions of the tool-components’ shapes with\nchange in overall size of the tool. Next, we explore related concepts of modularity and integra-\ntion of Clovis point blades and hafts, which provide insight into how Clovis people thought\nabout point-design and rejuvenating a dull or broken tool. Modularity refers to the different\nfunctional parts of a tool. Although created from a single stone, hafts and blades are modular,\nin that they are designed for different functions, but also integrated so they function as a single\ntool. Modularity analysis can reveal how stone tools were designed to be used safely and effec-\ntively from manufacture through discard or loss as the blade was resharpened or repaired.\nIntegration is how the functional parts work together. Integration analysis explores whether\nthe haft and blade covary in concert or independently. We look at each of these properties sta-\ntistically to determine whether they are present in Clovis points, and then consider the con-\ncepts together to better understand how the points were designed and used. These concepts\nalso are used to interpret statistical differences between cache and non-cache points. Lastly, we\nuse the allometry, modularity, and integration results along with linear dimensions and cen-\ntroid sizes to understand the design constraints on hafts and blades, i.e., how big or small a\nhaft must be to safely and effectively hold different-sized blades.\nIn North America, chipped stone points are typically composite tools made of two modules:\na proximal haft, which is attached to an organic haft, such as a handle or shaft (we use the term\n“handle” to distinguish the organic haft from the point haft), and a distal working end, which\nmay be used for cutting, scraping, piercing, or other function (we use the term “blade” as a\ncatchall designation [49:179–180]. We infer blades were sharpened or repaired, whereas hafts\nmay have been reworked to repair damage, maintain edge continuity, or fit new handles. To\nclarify the discussions that follow, we define resharpening as the removal of flakes from dull or\ndamaged blade edges to create new sharp edges. In contrast, reworking is the removal of flakes\nto change the haft’s shape or size without sharpening, although distal edges of a haft may be\nsharpened and incorporated into the blade.\nThe distinction between blade and haft modules is usually obvious. For example, in Early\nArchaic (ca. 11,500–8,000 years BP) notched or hafted points in the southeastern US, notch\nsize and haft width appear set within a narrow range because the blade-haft intersections can-\nnot be modified without fundamentally altering the haft shapes in obvious ways [50]. This is\nnot the case with Clovis and other lanceolate-shaped points in which the transitions from haft\nto blade are often not obvious. We agree with the general consensus that the distal extent of\nproximal lateral grinding or abrasion marks the transition and divide hafts and blades accord-\ningly (dotted lines in Fig 1) [35, 51, 52:38,cf. 53].

Using non-\ntechnological criteria to define blades and hafts, such as using constant percentages of overall\npoint size [e.g., 54] or a single length to define the haft [e.g., 55] masks the variation in point\nsizes and shapes produced in the past, leading to potentially skewing analyses and inferences.\nIncidence of allometry, modularity, and integration in archaeology\nThe phenomenon of allometry is generally well-accepted in the analysis of chipped stone\npoints and other tool types [56:82–83 and references cited therein] and probably accepted\nintuitively by most analysts [57, 58], but modularity and integration are rarely discussed.\nAllometry is manifested as the tool is reduced in size during repair, resharpening, or refurbish-\ning to satisfy a different function. Allometric variation is documented in flake tools, [e.g., 59–\n62] and especially in bifaces [55, 63–70: 93–99, 71–74:108–120, 75]. That bifaces should be par-\nticularly susceptible to allometric reduction is no surprise; on the contrary, their design, use\nand the damage they often suffer suggest that point blades, especially tips, require much more\nrepair by resharpening than do other segments or modules [65:163].

More extensive damage in other experiments also was concentrated on blades [56:Fig\n1]. Any similar prehistoric damage, whether repaired in hafts or not, would require resharpen-\ning and therefore reduction concentrated on point blades. The result would be disproportion-\nate size reduction on blades compared to other modules like hafts.\nAs above, most lithic analysts, including many Paleoindian ones, interpret much of the vari-\nation expressed in Paleoindian points as allometric. They agree, that is, that “Abundant experi-\nmental and allometric studies on projectile points have shown that. . .major size and shape\nchanges most frequently occur in the point blade, especially in its length” [77:163], a conclu-\nsion also reached in Buchanan’s [64] classic Folsom study.\nIn several studies over the last decade, Buchanan and colleagues have argued that Clovis\npoints do not show significant effects of allometry, concluding: Clovis points were not often\nresharpened, which was only a minor source of Clovis point variation [78:19]; Clovis points\nwere resharpened allometrically but blades were likely resharpened isometrically despite the\nauthors’ own general conclusion that in their dataset Clovis “allometric relationships were pro-\nduced primarily through resharpening” [79:11]; resharpening did not result in more shape var-\niation in blades than bases [54:728, see also 80:5], and resharpening and allometry may occur\nbut that fluted-point types preserve their original shape against allometry’s minor effects\n[81:356]. To resolve the difference between the general consensus of allometry’s common\nexpression and Buchanan and colleagues’ positions that allometry either does not occur or has\nminimal effects, we undertake the first explicit test of allometric variation in Clovis points\nFig 1.

It is important\nto note that whereas allometry is simply a scaling relationship of a changing variable (e.g.,\nshape, size, or number), the explanations for the phenomenon are discipline-specific. The clas-\nsic example of allometry in biology is the way size and shape of the human head changes from\nbirth to maturity relative to other body parts [82]. In contrast, isometry occurs when size and\nshape are independent, meaning shape change is not correlated with size change [48]. Changes\nin allometric rate and timing can make profound differences in an organism’s final phenotype\n[83]. In contrast to biological growth, allometric changes in chipped stone tools are in the oppo-\nsite direction, tools becoming smaller through time, but mathematically the processes are iden-\ntical [65, 84, 85]. LGM data are well-suited for allometry analysis because it treats shape\nindependently of size. Shapes are rescaled to minimize size differences, so the shapes of a large\nClovis cache point can be compared with a small non-cache point without the confounding\neffect of size. Allometry in LGM is identified by a line of best-fit in multivariate regression of\nshape on log-transformed size variables, usually centroid size (CS) [48, 86], but allometry also\ncan be studied in traditional tool dimensions, such as weight and length [e.g., 85].\nIn archaeology, allometry is surprisingly complex, with conceptual difficulties related to\nmanufacture, use, and discard behaviors. In biology, researchers know how extant organisms\ngrow and can fit their shapes in a growth continuum, making allometric inferences straightfor-\nward [87]. In contrast, we rarely know the starting shape or size of a prehistoric point for cer-\ntain [e.g., 88, 89], nor do we know whether the point we excavate was discarded at exhaustion\nor lost beforehand. This situation is more akin to paleontologists trying to reconstruct growth\nhistories of odd extinct organisms with sparse or noncontinuous data [90]. Some of the diffi-\nculties in interpretation are explained below.\nAllometric concepts have been used to infer patterns of tool use, seasonal movements, and\ndistances to quarries [63, 84, 91]. But allometry is also an important consideration in the analy-\nses of prehistoric social patterns [92, 93]. Point shapes are commonly used to infer prehistoric\nsocial relationships and organization or migration, under the general assumption that related\nsocial groups share social behaviors, such as making similar point shapes [94–97]. Changes to\nthe initial shape of a tool through damage, resharpening, or reworking potentially skew the sta-\ntistical analyses from which social relationships are inferred [98, 99]. Entire point shapes are\nthe most commonly used proxy for social relatedness, so ensuring shape variation created dur-\ning initial manufacture and subsequently changed through resharpening are not conflated is\nimportant [93]. If shape change from reworking or resharpening is isometric, then shape anal-\nyses without accounting for allometry will be unproblematic. But if allometric shape change is\nsignificant, then conflating equifinal causes of shape variation is likely.\nAllometry in points can be analyzed in several ways. The simplest is to examine whether the\nentire point shape varies with the entire point size. But allometry can also be analyzed using\ncomponents of the entire point-shape. In this case, the hafts and blades of the entire point are\nnatural components to consider because they are intentionally created parts of the point’s\ndesign. Examining the effects of the blade and haft on the point’s allometry can provide insight\ninto initial design and subsequent use of the tool.\nWhat are modularity and integration?. The concepts of modularity and integration are\nclosely related but not simply two ends of a continuum [100]. We naturally think of the blade\nPLOS ONE\nExploring Clovis Point Allometry, Modularity, and Integration using Geome tric Morpho metrics\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02894 89 August 16, 2023 5 / 24\nand haft modules of Clovis and other prehistoric points as integrated into a functional whole\n[101–103:2]. This common conceptualization of modularity and integration concerns func-\ntion–how the two modules contribute to the functionality of the tool. A knife with a handle\nand a blade is a good analogy for these concepts. The handle and blade are independent mod-\nules of the knife, and each module can be analyzed independently. But, although independent,\nthe modules are integrated and function together for the knife to work properly. One would\nnever use a handle without a blade and using a blade without a handle could be dangerous or\nineffective. Also, different blade shapes can require different handle types. In contrast, a pencil\nwith an eraser is modular but not integrated. Each module can function independently with\nno loss of effectiveness. We may seek to understand whether a different tool design would be\nmore or less effective, or how module designs evolved through time or varied across space, and\nfrom these infer why the human choices were made. But in the end these inquiries concern\ntool function. Modularity and integration are used differently in shape analyses, where the\ngoal is to understand how and the degree to which module shapes vary independently. In biol-\nogy the concepts are used to investigate developmental, genetic, or functional linkages within\nand among taxa (see [104] for examples). In archaeology, the concepts can provide insight into\ntool function and use-life.\nHere, we are interested in the relative independence of the Clovis blade and haft compo-\nnents, i.e., the relative degree to which their shapes covary [105:591] because that provides\ninsight into how the tools were used and changed through their use-lives. Modularity means\ncomponents have greater within-component than between-component covariation. But mod-\nularity is not an either-or condition; shapes can be more or less modular [100:121]. A shape\nstructure is integrated if its components are correlated. Perfect integration means the variation\nin a small region of the shape would perfectly predict the rest of the shape [106:44]. To illus-\ntrate the concept for Clovis points, perfect integration hypotheically could mean every time\nthe haft changes by 1% (however that might be measured), the blade changes by 5%. The\nchanges are not necessarily isometric because change may not be uniform, but they are per-\nfectly integrated. Shape components can be modular and not integrated, integrated and not\nmodular, neither integrated nor modular, and both modular and integrated.\nThis last possibility may seem counterintuitive but can occur in part because of ways modu-\nlarity and integration are tested; the modularity signal will be relatively stronger or weaker\ndepending on the strength of integration [100:597, 105]. Allometry can contribute substan-\ntially to integration of shape components [105:594]. Even if modularity is significant, strong\nsignals of allometry affecting most or all of the structure can produce strong integration\n[106:47] and obscure strong but relatively weaker modular structure [107:416]. A structure\nwith strong within-module covariation but even stronger between-module covariation may\nresult in an erroneous inference of no modularity.\nMaterial and methods\nOur dataset (Tables 1 and S1) came from 2D images collected by Slade [108] and Williams\n[109, 110] by scanning or photographing original artifacts or casts, obtaining images from\nmuseum staff or archaeologists, or from the internet. We chose to use 2D mainly to make our\nanalyses more directly comparable with earlier work but also because the 2D data was readily\navailable. We suspect the third dimension–thickness–wo uld not have a significant effect on\nthe results, but this is a hypothesis worth testing in future work. Other than abrasion length,\nwhich was always taken from actual points or high-quality casts, linear dimensions were usu-\nally measured by calipers on points or casts, but sometimes from images. Using high-quality\ncasts does not affect the accuracy of the linear measurements [64] or the detection of lateral\nPLOS ONE\nExploring Clovis Point Allometry, Modularity, and Integration using Geome tric Morpho metrics\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02894 89 August 16, 2023 6 / 24\nabrasion. Casts analyzed by Shott and Ota ´ rola-Castillo [56] retained clear evidence of edge\nabrasion that correlated with independent measurement of the haft-blade juncture on the cor-\nresponding stone points by Hunzicker [111]. Images deemed too low quality for accurate land-\nmark placement or linear measurement were not used. Linear measurements taken from well-\nscaled and scanned images have been found to produce accurate results [109, 112]. The lateral\nextent of abrasion was identified by lightly running fingers along the edges several times to\nfind where the abrasion ended and then measured with calipers. Points that did not have\nunambiguous transitions were not used. All lateral abrasion measurements were done by Slade\nto eliminate inter-observer variation. We defined the haft-blade juncture as the longest abra-\nsion-length when it differed on each side. Data on individual points, including site name and\ntype, haft-length, haft-width, blade-length, maximum-length, heuristic haft-size class, and the\nratio of haft-length to maximum-length are in S1 Table.\nFluted points, including Clovis points, have been analyzed with LGM frequently, although\ntechniques vary [55, 56, 81, 93, 94, 96, 98, 99, 113]. Here we focus on two approaches, ours and\nthose used by Buchanan and colleagues in several publications. Most of the details are the\nsame, but we mainly differ in how the hafts and blades are defined, which makes a substantial\ndifference in analysis, results, and inferences. The question is which approach is a better proxy\nfor capturing the haft and blade shapes: our actual measurements based on technological indi-\ncators of blade/haft transition, or Buchanan and colleagues’ approximations based on percent-\nage of total point length to define the blade/haft dimensions on all points. We find the\napproach taken by Smith et al. [55:103245] to use a single standard measurement (13 mm) of\nthe proximal end of each point to define the “bases and blade portions” of fluted points to be\nuseful in some analyses, but neither are appropriate proxies for hafts and blades (Fig 2). The\nanalytical effects of the different LM placement strategies are discussed in more detail in the\nDiscussion.\nWe defined the outline of the points with 23 total LMs using tpsDig2 v. 2.31 [115]: five reg-\nular LMs at the blade-haft juncture (LMs 1, 4), haft ears (LMs 2–3) and blade tip (LM 5) and\nfive connecting curves with a total of 18 evenly spaced semi-landmarks between them, which\nwere converted to regular LMs in tpsUtil v. 1.76 [115]. Three of us (DT, MS, JW) placed LMs\nand semi-landmarks, estimating LM locations for small breaks on tips, ears, and edges, and the\nresults were averaged. Points with large breaks were not used. The 23-LM configuration (Fig\n3A) mimics the 23-LM configuration used by Buchanan et al. [54:Fig 2]. We did not slide\nsemi-landmarks because we do not see an anthropological reason justifying the practice. In\ncontrast, Buchanan and colleagues [54:Fig 2] defined the outline of points using 3 LMs at the\ntip and 2 ears. Then semi-landmarks were presumably evenly placed along the outline with\ntpsDig2 and converted to LMs. We note that the LM configuration in the 2018 publication is\ndifferent from those used earlier [78, 94, 116], where the program MakeFan6 [117] was used.\nMakeFan6 creates equally spaced lines perpendicular to a base line that intersect the edges for\nLM placement. Both techniques are perfectly acceptable but produce slightly different LM con-\nfigurations that are not precisely comparable.\nLGM analyses employ entire shapes as single multivariate units of spatial relations and\ninterrelations of the landmarks that define them [48]. LGM eliminates the need to rely on a set\nof “traits”, such as linear dimensions, angles, ratios, or categorical data, which usually are lim-\nited shape descriptors [56, 106, 118–120]. Our 100 Clovis point shapes were translated, rotated,\nand rescaled to unit size for comparative analyses through generalized Procrustes analysis\n(GPA), which minimizes the distances between homologous LMs on each shape through a\ngeneralized least squares process [120]. After GPA, the shapes are orthogonal to (i.e., indepen-\ndent of) size unless allometry is present. Thus, LGM allometric analysis determines whether\nPLOS ONE\nExploring Clovis Point Allometry, Modularity, and Integration using Geome tric Morpho metrics\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02894 89 August 16, 2023 7 / 24\nsize covaries with shape after GPA, i.e., whether the shapes of the Clovis points, or their parts,\nchange nonuniformly as points get smaller through resharpening or reworking.\nFig 2.

CS is the standard size\nproxy in LGM analyses [106:47], although other measurements may also be appropriate [85].\nWe use centroid sizes of the entire point (CSE), blade (CSB), and haft (CSH) shapes, which are\ncalculated as the square root of the sum of the squared distances from all the LMs defining the\nshape to the shape’s center [48, 83]. The natural logarithm of CS (lnCS) was used in all analy-\nses. Significance of the covariation of size and shape is tested with a nonparametric permuta-\ntion test based on Goodall’s [121] F statistic.\nProcrustes-aligned entire point, blade, and haft shapes were regressed upon their respective\nlnCS using the generalized linear model (procD.lm function) in the geomorph package [122] in\nR 4.2.2 [123] run in RStudio v.2022.12.0+353 [124]. The presence of allometry was tested by\ncomparing the regression slopes against a null model of isometric change in a Procrustes\nANOVA performed using the sum of squared Procrustes distances [121]. Isometric change\nwould have a slope of zero, i.e., no change in shape as size changed, whereas allometric change\nwould have a non-zero slope. Geomorph implements a residual randomization permutation\nprocedure (RRPP) that randomizes model residuals to estimate a probability distribution for\nthe interaction effects [125–127]. Among its many benefits, RRPP facilitates nonparametric\nANOVA analyses. R code used in the analyses and to create most of the figures is in S1 File.\nThe first allometry test is straightforward: whether the entire point shape shows an allome-\ntric signature. It does, as do the haft and blade modules. The results are highly significant for\nFig 3. LM configur ation and LM distribution s after GPA. The dotted horizontal lines show the stem and blade\njuncture .\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0289489.g0 03\nPLOS ONE\nExploring Clovis Point Allometry, Modularity, and Integration using Geome tric Morpho metrics\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02894 89 August 16, 2023 9 / 24\nthe entire shape (F = 55.22; df = 1, 98; p < .001), the haft shape (F = 26.95; df = 1, 98; p < .001),\nand the blade shape (F = 69.67; df = 1, 98; p < .001), and we confidently reject the null hypoth-\nesis of “no allometry” (full results in S2 Table 1 in S2 Table). The ANOVA results also show\nmost of the shape changes occur in the blades. The r\n2\ncoefficient of determination is a measure\nof the amount of shape variation explained by changes in size. Here, 36% of shape variation in\nthe entire point is explained by overall size, and 22% of the haft-shape change is explained by\nhaft-size. In contrast, 42% of blade-shape change is explained by changes in blade-size, sup-\nporting an inference that most allometric change in Clovis points is due to blade resharpening.\nAllometry of cache and non-cache points\nExploring further, we examined differences between cache and non-cache points. Caches are\nclassic Clovis site types (e.g., [4]) that others have analyzed to determine whether either or both\nClovis point shapes or allometries are different. We relied on previously published cache site\nidentifications (S2 Table 1 in S2 Table). Buchanan, Kilby, et al. [79:4] inferred the shapes of\ncache and non-cache Clovis points were not significantly different. We found the opposite;\nentire, blade, and haft-shapes were all highly significantly different (Entire: F = 16.87; df = 1,98;\np = .001; Blade: F = 22.78; df = 1,98; p = .001; Haft: F = 12.97; df = 1,98; p = .001; S2 Table 2 in S2\nTable). Fig 4 shows mean cache and non-cache shapes and illustrates the differences in the posi-\ntions of their haft-blade junctures. They also inferred [79:4] the allometries of cache and non-\ncache Clovis points were not significantly different, meaning they were resharpened and\nreworked in the same ways. We tested the differences in allometries by comparing the common\nallometry of all 100 points with the unique allometries of the cache and non-cache points. We\nfound that allometry patterns of cache and non-cache entire point shapes were significantly dif-\nferent (F = 9.843; Resdf = 97,96; p = .002; S2 Table 3 in S2 Table). Fig 5 plots the unique allome-\ntries of cache (black triangles) and non-cache points (red open circles) for entire shapes on their\nlnCSs (function plotAllometry). Shapes are described by Regression Score, which “is the shape\nvariable that has the maximal covariation with. .. log-transformed centroid size” [48:122]. In\ngeomorph, regression scores are projections “of data on [a] normalized vector that expresses the\ncovariation between shape and the regression coefficients for size.” [48:122, 123]. Plots of\nregression scores versus lnCSs capture both the projected variation due to size and the residual\nvariation, which is typically the error component. Here, some error can be understood as varia-\ntion due to other factors, which could include region, raw material type and package-size, site\nfunction, time period, tool-function differences, or statistical error. These findings complement\nand do not contradict our earlier finding that Clovis points overall show robust allometries in\ntheir entire shapes, blades, and hafts (S2 Table 1 in S2 Table).\nModularity and integration analyses\nModularity and integration in geomorph are evaluated to identify “exceptional” correlations\nrelative to some H\n0\n. Modularity is assessed with a covariance ratio (CR), measured against a\nnull of no modularity using a permutation test. The CR statistic is the ratio of between-mod-\nules and within-module covariances. Thus, a CR statistic of 1 means the covariance between\nand within modules is the same. A CR statistic below 1 means the covariance within modules\nis higher than between modules, which translates to a signal of modularity [104]. Our CR is\n1.0018, which >1, but the distribution is skewed and the p = .017 indicates the null hypothesis\nof “no modularity” should be rejected).\nFor integration we use a Multivariate Association measure (r-PLS), and the best of those is\nPartial Least Squares (geomorph’s integration.test function). We ask whether there is greater\ncovariation between modules than expected by random association of modules. Unlike the\nPLOS ONE\nExploring Clovis Point Allometry, Modularity, and Integration using Geome tric Morpho metrics\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02894 89 August 16, 2023 10 / 24\nmodularity test, integration.test does not concern within-module covariation and is evaluated\nby shuffling the rows (objects) of one module while leaving the other module the same [104].\nThe null hypothesis is no integration. Our data had a r-PLS value of 0.943 and p = .001, with\nan effect size of 7.5694, which indicates the blade and haft are very strongly integrated (Dean\nAdams, personal communication 2020).\nOur interpretation is that Clovis points have a strong signal of modularity but also very\nstrong integration; these interpretations do not conflict. The allometry and modularity results\nindicate much of the variation in Clovis points lies in changes in location of the haft-blade\njunction. Strong integration manifests in the fact that Clovis points are readily identifiable by\ntheir general lanceolate shape with no dramatic transition from haft to blade regardless of size.\nChanges in small parts of the point shape are somewhat predictive of overall point shape\nchange. Contrast this with a Paleoindian Dalton point, in which the size and shape of the haft\nis not predictive of blade size and shape [58, 128, 129].\nDiscussion\nIn sum, our results show that Clovis point shapes produce a strong signal of allometry, and we\nreject the null hypothesis of isometry (Fig 1A). We conclude that Clovis people made, used,\nand resharpened the point blades at rates and in manners different from point hafts, and the\nFig 4. Mean shapes for (A) cache and (B) non-cache points.

Most of the shape changes are in the blade, although the haft also\nchanges, indicating at least some resharpening was likely. The modular blade and haft shapes\nare strongly integrated, meaning they were designed, resharpened, and reworked in concert,\nalthough not in the same ways. By closely examining how the haft and blade dimensions\ncovary, we can get a better understanding of how these integrated modules were constrained\nin size and shape during their initial designs and use-lives.\nWhy do our results differ so markedly from Buchanan and colleagues’? The main reason\nseems to be the definition of the blade/haft transition. Both analyses divided the points into\ntwo modules: a blade and a haft, indicated by dotted lines in Fig 3 and Buchanan et al. [54:Fig\n2]. Although the images look similar, especially at the important blade-haft juncture, the crite-\nria for setting that juncture are different. We used specific LMs to define the lateral extents of\nthat transition whereas Buchanan and colleagues did not. Buchanan et al. [54] used a single\napproximation of the juncture, and we measured it. Measuring along the midline from the\npoint tip (LM 1) to the top of the basal concavity, the Buchanan and colleagues’ haft-length is\nabout 40% of the entire length. This technique ensures the haft and blade will maintain their\n*40/60% relative dimensions regardless of the actual location of the juncture as measured by\nabrasion length. If a blade was shortened through resharpening but the haft untouched,\nBuchanan and colleagues’ relative position of the juncture would ensure that the blade was\nalways *40% of the entire length, whether that actually happened in the past.\nIt is also important to note that the LGM estimate of blade-haft juncture in Buchanan and\ncolleagues’ [54] analysis is different from their prior estimates of juncture location that used\nunivariate estimates of haft and blade size. Buchanan and colleagues used an arbitrary estimate\nFig 5.

Because the edge boundaries are\ncurved, 1/3 of their lengths will be near but not precisely the same as 1/3 of the total midline\nlength. Our measured lengths produced a range of values for haft length as a percentage of\nmaximum length (S1 Table). For all data, the mean and median are 32% but ranges from 12–\n50%. Interestingly, the mean and median of non-cache points is 33%, but cache points are 27%\nand 25%, respectively. Further, cache points range from 12–46% and non-cache points from\n16–50%. Fig 3 compares the measured juncture locations on the cache East Wenatchee (21%)\nand non-cache Leikem (48%) points (S1 Table) with Buchanan and colleagues’ 33% and 40%\nestimates, and Smith et al. [55] 13 mm measurement.\nIt is unclear whether Clovis points were made in a single large size and resharpened and\nreworked before discard (Pattern 1), several standard sizes and only resharpened before dis-\ncard (Pattern 2), or many sizes and rarely resharpened before discard (Pattern 3). These three\ndesign-and-use patterns are illustrated in Fig 1C. Pattern 1 Clovis points would have been\nmade in a large size (with variation due to raw material, haft size, conflated time-trends, and\nother local conditions) and got gradually smaller as the working edges of the blades were\nresharpened and the haft was shortened and then narrowed to maintain the integration pat-\ntern. In Fig 1C1, a large point was manufactured, then the blade was progressively shortened\nthrough resharpening (1C2-1C3). The point was then removed from the haft, the blade reshar-\npened, haft reworked, and haft-blade juncture moved proximally by sharpening the abraded\ndistal end of the haft (1C4). In 1C5, the point was removed from the haft to move the juncture\nproximally by resharpening the abraded distal edges of the haft to create a longer blade, and\nthen reattached to the same haft. In 1C6, the blade was resharpened. Then the point was not\nfurther resharpened and discarded. The actual sequence for any particular point is unknown\nand likely variable depending on circumstances. Pattern 2 might involve two original sizes,\nrepresented by 1C1 and 1C4. The large size 1C1 would be reduced through 1C3, when it was\ndiscarded. The smaller size 1C4 was reduced through 1C5, when its juncture was moved, and\nthe point reused and resharpened until reaching 1C6 when it was discarded. In Pattern 3, 1C1,\n1C3, 1C4, and 1C5 represent the initial sizes, which were never reworked and either never or\nminimally resharpened before discard.\nWe start with the assumption that in the integrated Clovis point design, hafts must be of\nsufficient size and shape to hold blades safely and effectively for the tool to function. Our use\nof technological criteria to define blade/haft junctions allow us to explore these haft design cri-\nteria. Neither module is independent of the other in the proper functioning of the tool, but\neach has different functional limitations. Hafts that are too short or narrow might allow the\ntool to slip or come loose in the handle rendering its use unsafe or ineffective. This assumption\ndoes not depend on how the point was attached to the handle or its shape, which for Clovis\nTable 2.

Regardless of how hafts were\nhafted, the strong integration of point hafts and blades indicates that proper functioning of the\nClovis point required the haft and blade to be about the same width. Additionally, configura-\ntions of hafts and blades were intended to maximize useable blade-lengths because blades did\nthe work and hafts were designed to hold the blades securely in the correct position. We can\nexamine the haft and blade modules design constraints by comparing linear dimensions of the\nmodules in three bivariate plots of haft length and width and blade width (Figs 6–8).\nTo facilitate analysis and visualization of haft functional constraints, four heuristic haft-\nwidth size classes were designated in the scatterplot of haft-width to haft-length (Fig 6), with\nhaft-width as the discriminating size-class dimension. Eighteen small category points (solid\nblue circles) have haft-widths between 17 and 24 mm; 23 medium category points (green\nsquares) ranged from 25 to 29 mm, and 28 large points (solid red triangles) ranged from 30–40\nmm. Five small points (three from Blackwater Draw and two from Lehner) were included in a\nseparate “very small” category (open circles with crosses) because they have significantly\nshorter haft-lengths ranging from 5 to 8 mm. Boxes enclose the main concentrations of each\ncategory. Whether these size-classes represent intention at manufacture or just capture varia-\ntion in a continuum of resharpening and reworking is unknown. Nonetheless, the classes are\nheuristics for illustrating the functional constraints of covarying haft and blade linear measure-\nments. The dimension ranges for haft, blade, and maximum lengths organized by haft-width\nsize-classes are listed in Table 2. We agree with Kilby [5] that at least some cache points had\nspecial uses, which can be inferred from Figs 4, 5 and the linear data in S1 Table, so we limit\nour analyses of functional constraints to the 74 non-cache points.\nFig 6.

Within the haft, shape is allometric with\nhaft-length but not haft-width (S2 Table 4 in S2 Table), meaning that of the two heuristic size-\nclasses, haft shapes are primarily affected by changes in haft-lengths but not haft-widths. This\ninference is confirmed by the coefficient of determination (r\n2\n) results where haft-length con-\ntributes to about 9% of the variation but haft-width contributes about 1%, essentially no\ncontribution.\nThe scatterplot of haft-length to haft-width (Fig 6; dot color and shapes are the same in Figs\n7 and 8) illustrates that haft-lengths are variable with high overlap between heuristic haft-width\nsize-classes, supporting the earlier analyses showing haft-lengths capture most of the haft shape\nvariation (S2 Table 4 in S2 Table). Fig 7, a plot of haft-widths and blade-lengths, clarifies func-\ntional limits of hafts. For the small class, blades were no longer than *48 mm and rarely longer\nthan *40 mm, from which we infer small hafts could not adequately hold blades larger than 48\nmm. The medium-width hafts held blades up to *67 mm, and large-width hafts could hold\nblades up to *90 mm in length. Haft-length also had functional constraints. Fig 8 plots haft-\nlength against blade-length, and the majority of points in the four heuristic haft-length size clas-\nses are circumscribed by boxes. In the very small category, haft lengths between 5 and 8 mm\ncould only hold blades up to 31 mm in length. Usually, haft-lengths must have been at least\n*10 mm, and small category haft-lengths (10–19 mm) could hold blades no more than *48\nmm in length. Medium-length hafts typically held blades no longer than 61 mm. Hafts *26\nmm and longer were needed to hold larger blades between *62 to *90 mm long.\nLOWESS (LOcally WEighted Scatterplot Smoothing) lines are plotted in Figs 6–8 and pro-\nvide some insight into how a Clovis point might have been resharpened, regardless of its start-\ning size. LOWESS lines, which are nonparametric regressions that express local relationships\n(i.e., without outliers) with smooth lines in a scatterplot, are often used in exploratory data anal-\nysis for time series data. We can think of the bivariate plots as capturing either several initial\nsizes or the changes through time in several dimensions of Clovis points from manufacture to\ndiscard. In the latter case, the LOWESS line approximates the dimensional changes experienced\nby individual Clovis points that transit most of the resharpening trajectory. A typical larger\npoint might have been made with a 90 mm blade and a haft that was *32 mm long (Fig 8) and\n*37 mm wide (Fig 7). The blade was resharpened or repaired by removing flakes around its\nedges, thereby narrowing and shortening it. Earlier we proposed that when large Clovis point\nblades were resharpened, point hafts could have been shortened to maintain a long blade until\nreaching a length where the shortened haft could no longer adequately hold the blade in place.\nWe also know from the strong integration results, the width of the haft was generally the same\nas the blade, so hafts should have been narrowed as the blades were resharpened.\nThe LOWESS lines in Figs 7 and 8 indicate that as the blade was resharpened, the haft-\nlength stayed the same until the blade reached *60 mm, but the haft-width gradually nar-\nrowed until it reached *31 mm. At *60 mm blade-length, the haft-length reached an inflec-\ntion point and began to shorten at a constant rate until it reached about 12 mm. Haft\nshortening would be necessary to maximize usable blade length. Otherwise, usable stone that\ncould be used in the tool’s function would be “wasted” in the haft. The haft-length shortened\nat half the rate as the blade (*1 mm for every 2 mm of blade length loss). The haft-width nar-\nrowed *1 mm for every 6 mm of blade length loss until the blade reached 47 mm, at which\ntime the rate of haft narrowing increased to *1 mm for every 2 mm of blade length loss. In\nsum, as predicted, haft-width started narrowing as soon as blades shortened (and presumably\nnarrowed) to maintain the general haft-width/blade-width parity. In contrast, haft-length was\nsteady until blade-length reached about 60 mm and then started to shorten. We interpret the\n60 mm as generally the longest blade-length at which shorter hafts could safely hold the blade,\nand it also marked the maximum blade-length for the medium-size haft-lengths (Fig 8). But\nPLOS ONE\nExploring Clovis Point Allometry, Modularity, and Integration using Geome tric Morpho metrics\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02894 89 August 16, 2023 16 / 24\nthere certainly were exceptions to this general trend as shown by points outside the boxes. At\nblade-length *47 mm, haft-width also reached an inflection point at which its rate of narrow-\ning increased until about 18 mm (Fig 7). Haft narrowing became more pronounced at an\ninflection point of * 30 mm, when blade-length was about *45 mm. Hafts narrowed and\nshortened at about the same rate when hafts reached *30 in length and 32 mm in width (Fig\n7). Fig 9 summarizes the haft and blade size variation by presenting the largest and smallest\npoints in each haft-width size-class and illustrates the overlap in haft-length and blade-length\nin each class.\nConclusion\nWhy does it matter that Clovis points are allometric and their blades and hafts are modular and\nintegrated? First, we get a more accurate understanding of Clovis point design and life-history,\nand it is satisfying to demonstrate that Clovis points follow a general allometry pattern like the\nrest of North American points, with blade shapes more variable than haft shapes. Second, the\nhigh integration of haft and blade modules puts overall Clovis point shape in clearer context.\nWe can better understand how Clovis point-makers and users thought about safety, effective-\nness, and efficiency and how those concerns were manifested in the points. Third, if one is inter-\nested in using Clovis point shapes to infer spatial or temporal social relationships, the fact that\nblade-shape variation contributes to nearly 35% of total point shape variation must be taken\ninto consideration when using entire point shapes for such analyses [92, 93, 132].\nOf course, allometry should be neither assumed nor assumed away. We explicitly tested for\nallometry in a sample of Clovis points using LGM methods designed in part for that purpose.\nResults corroborate the general consensus on allometry’s relationship to resharpening. Previ-\nous LGM studies that failed to detect allometry in Paleoindian tools either are interesting\nexceptions to a general pattern recognized by most lithic analysts or limited by their research\ndesign and methodology. To resolve those possibilities, the datasets should be reanalyzed but\nFig 9. Longest and shortest points in each non-cache haft-widt h size-class. Maximum lengths of points are listed;\nhaft-blad e juncture s indicated by dotted lines and italicized haft-lengths . Width variation in each size-clas s is not\nillustrated.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0289489.g0 09\nPLOS ONE\nExploring Clovis Point Allometry, Modularity, and Integration using Geome tric Morpho metrics\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02894 89 August 16, 2023 17 / 24\nonly after defining stem and blade modules independently of their landmarking or similar cod-\ning schemes. Then original design and the possibility of subsequent allometry can be distin-\nguished as sources of morphometric variation in Paleoindian points. Only if allometry is\nsought can its absence be demonstrated rather than assumed. The sometimes far-reaching\nimplications drawn (e.g., tempo and mode of prehistoric colonization, the rates, patterns and\ncauses of type diversification, standardization and its relationship to functional specificity,\nscaling laws among types) from studies that do not explicitly test for and therefore control for\nallometry also can be evaluated.\nFinally, this work demonstrates the importance of considered LM placement. Most LGM\nanalyses of LMs use many more semilandmarks than regular LMs, which may significantly\naffect statistical results and interpretations [93]. Here we show that LM placement criteria\nshould capture the technological aspect of the artifact that is being studied. We were interested\nin the relationships between the blades and hafts, so defining those precisely with LMs was\ncritical, but that LM pattern will not be appropriate for all artifact shape analyses [e.g., 55]. If\nLM placement is not technologically justifiable, the results will be suspect.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Site locations.
