  "abstract": "Abstract Objective Patients with rheumatic diseases often have multiple comorbidities which may impact well‐being leading to high psychosocial complexity. This scoping review was undertaken to identify complexity measures/tools used in rheumatology that could help in planning and coordinating care. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched from database inception to 14 December 2019 using keywords and Medical Subject Headings for “care coordination”, “complexity” and selected rheumatic diseases and known complexity measures/tools. Articles describing the development or use of complexity measures/tools in patients with adult rheumatologic diagnoses were included regardless of study design. Included articles were evaluated for risk of bias where applicable. Results The search yielded 407 articles, 37 underwent full‐text review and 2 were identified during a hand search with 9 included articles. Only 2 complexity tools used in populations of adult patients with rheumatic disease were identified: the SLENQ and the INTERMED. The SLENQ is a 97‐item patient needs questionnaire developed for patients with systemic lupus (n = 1 study describing tool development) and applied in 5 cross‐sectional studies. Three studies (a practice article, trial and a cross‐sectional study) applied the INTERMED, a clinical interview to ascertain complexity and support coordinated care, in patients with rheumatologic diagnoses. Conclusions There is limited information on the use of patient complexity measures/tools in rheumatology. Such tools could be applied to coordinate multidisciplinary care and improve patient experience and outcomes. Patient contribution This scoping review will be presented to patient research partners involved in co‐designing a future study on patient complexity in rheumatic disease.",
