Pre-trained on the large-scale gen-\neral corpus, PLMs (Devlin et al., 2019) can be\neffectively transferred into new domains or tasks\nby continual pre-training on task-specific datasets.\nDifferent from traditional text comprehension tasks,\nas shown in Figure 1, math problems usually in-\nvolve a complex mixture of mathematical symbols,\nlogic and formulas, which becomes a barrier to the\naccurate understanding of math problems.\nHowever, previous works (Reusch et al., 2021;\nShen et al., 2021) mostly oversimplify the issues\nof math problem understanding. They directly con-\ncatenate the formulas with the textual description\nas an entire sentence, and then perform continual\npre-training and encoding without special consid-\nerations. Therefore, two major shortcomings are\nlikely to affect the understanding of math problems.\nFirst, formulas (the most important elements of the\nproblem) contain complex mathematical logic, and\nmodeling them as plain text may incur the loss of\nimportant information. Second, the textual descrip-\ntion contains essential explanations or hints about\nthe symbols and logic within the formulas. Hence,\nit is necessary to accurately capture fine-grained\n5923\ncorrelations between words from the description\ntext and symbols from math formulas.\nTo better model the computational logic of for-\nmulas, operator trees are introduced to represent the\nmath formulas (Zanibbi and Blostein, 2012), which\nare subsequently encoded by graph neural network\n(GNN). Although these methods can improve the\ncomprehension capacity of math problems to some\nextent, there still exists a semantic gap between\ngraph encoding and text encoding due to the hetero-\ngeneity of formulas and texts. With simple concate-\nnation or self-attention mechanisms (Peng et al.,\n2021), it is still hard to capture the fine-grained\nassociations among tokens and symbols, e.g., the\ndependency relation between math symbols and\ncorresponding explanation tokens.\nIn order to better fuse the information from for-\nmulas and texts, our solution is twofold. First, we\nconstruct a syntax-aware memory network based\non a structure called math syntax graph (Figure 1),\nwhich integrates operator trees from formulas and\nsyntax trees from texts. The key point lies in that\nwe store the node embeddings from the GNN and\ndependency relation embeddings as entries of mem-\nory networks, and then design the corresponding\nread and write mechanism, using token embed-\ndings from the PLM as queries. Such a way can\neffectively associate the representation spaces of\nthe text and formulas. Second, we devise specific\ncontinual pre-training tasks to further enhance and\nfuse the text and graph representations, including\nthe masked language model and dependency triplet\ncompletion tasks to improve the understanding of\nmath symbols in the text and formulas logic in\nthe syntax graph, respectively, and the text-graph\ncontrastive learning task to align and unify the rep-\nresentations of the text and graph.\nTo this end, we proposeCOMUS, to continually\npre-train language models for math problem\nunderstanding with syntax-aware memory network.\nIn our approach, we first encode the textual de-\nscription and math syntax graph via PLM and GAT,\nrespectively. Then, we add syntax-aware memory\nnetworks between the last k layers of PLM and\nGAT. In each of the lastk layers, we first conduct\nthe multi-view read and write operation to fuse\nthe token and node representations, respectively,\nand then adopt the next layer of PLM and GAT\nto encode the fused representations. All parame-\nters of our model are initialized from PLMs and\nwill be continually pre-trained by our devised three\ntasks, namely masked language model, dependency\ntriplet completion and text-graph contrastive learn-\ning. Experimental results on four tasks in the math\ndomain have demonstrated the effectiveness of our\napproach, especially with limited training data.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n(1) We construct a novel syntax-aware memory\nnetwork to capture the fine-grained interactions\nbetween the text and formulas.\n(2) We design three continual pre-training tasks\nto further align and fuse the representations of the\ntext and graph data.\n(3) Experiments on four tasks in the math do-\nmain demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.\n2 Preliminaries\nIn this section, we formulate the problem statement\nand then introduce the math syntax graph.\nProblem Statement. Generally, a math problem\nconsists of a textual description d and several for-\nmulas {f1, f2, ··· , fm}. The textual description\nprovides necessary background information for the\nmath problem. It is formally denoted as a sequence\nof tokens d = {t1, t2, ··· , tl}, where ti is either\na word token or a mathematical symbol ( e.g., a\nnumber or an operator). The formulas describe the\nrelationship among mathematical symbols, which\nis the key to understand and solve the math problem.\nEach formula consists of a sequence of mathemati-\ncal symbols, denoted as fi = {s1, ··· , sn}.\nBased on the above notations, this work focuses\non continually pre-training a PLM on unsupervised\nmath problem corpus for domain adaptation. After\nthat, the PLM can be fine-tuned on various tasks in\nthe math domain (e.g., knowledge point classifica-\ntion), and improve the task performance.\nMath Syntax Graph. In order to understand the\nmathematical text and formulas, it needs to capture\nthe complex correlations within words, symbols\nand operators. Inspired by previous works (Man-\nsouri et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2021), we construct\na syntax graph, where the textual description is\nrepresented as a syntax dependency tree and the\nformulas are represented as operator trees (OPT).\nSpecifically, given a math problem consisting\nof a textual description d and several formulas\n{f1, f2, ··· , fm}, we first utilize the open-source\ntoolkit TangentS1 to convert each formula into an\n1https://github.com/BehroozMansouri/TangentCFT\n5924\nOPT, and Stanza2 to convert the textual description\ninto a syntax dependency tree. Then, we com-\nbine the syntax dependency tree and the OPTs to\ncompose an entire graph, where a special token\n“[MATH] ” is applied to link them. We call such\na composite graph as the math syntax graph G of\nthe math problem. Let N and R denote the set\nof nodes and relations on G, respectively. We can\nextract dependency triplets from G, where a depen-\ndency triplet (h, r, t) denotes that there exists an\nedge with the relation r ∈ Rto link the head node\nh ∈ Nto the tail node t ∈ N.\n3 Methodology\nAs shown in Figure 2, our approach aims to effec-\ntively encode the textual description and formulas,\nand fuse these two kinds of information for under-\nstanding math problems. In what follows, we first\npresent the base models for encoding math prob-\nlems, and then introduce the devised syntax-aware\nmemory network and continual pre-training tasks.\n3.1 Base Models\nEncoding Math Text. We use BERT (Devlin et al.,\n2019) as the PLM to encode the math text, i.e., the\ntextual description d. Given d = {t1, t2, ··· , tL}\nof a math problem, the PLM first projects these to-\nkens into corresponding embeddings. Then, a stack\nof Transformer layers will gradually encode the em-\nbeddings to generate the l-th layer representations\n{h(l)\n1 , h(l)\n2 , ··· , h(l)\nL }. Since the textual description\nd may contain specific math symbols that were not\nseen during pre-training, we add them into the vo-\ncabulary of the PLM and randomly initialize their\ntoken embeddings. These new embeddings will be\nlearned during continual pre-training.\nEncoding Math Syntax Graph. We incorporate a\ngraph attention network (GAT) (Veliˇckovi´c et al.,\n2018) to encode the math syntax graph, which is\ncomposed of an embedding layer and a stack of\ngraph attention layers. Given a math syntax graph\nG with N nodes, the GAT first maps the nodes\ninto a set of embeddings {n1, n2, ··· , nN }. Then\neach graph attention layer aggregates the neighbors’\nhidden states using multi-head attentions to update\nthe node representations as:\nn(l+1)\ni =\nK\n∥\nk=1\nσ(\nX\nj∈Ni\nαk\nijW(l)\nk n(l)\nj ). (1)\n2https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/\nwhere n(l+1)\ni is the representation of the i-th node\nin the l + 1layer, ∥ denotes the concatenation op-\neration, σ denotes the sigmoid function, K is the\nnumber of attention heads, Ni is the set of neigh-\nbors of node i in the graph, W(l)\nk is a learnable\nmatrix, and αk\nij is the attention value of the node i\nto its neighbor j in attention head k.\n3.2 Syntax-Aware Memory Network\nTo improve the semantic interaction and fusion\nof the representations of math text and the syntax\ngraph, we add k syntax-aware memory networks\nbetween the last k layers of PLM and GAT. In the\nmemory network, node embeddings (from the math\nsyntax graph) with dependency relations are con-\nsidered as slot entries, and we design multi-view\nread/write operations to allow token embeddings\n(e.g., explanation tokens or hints) to attend to highly\nrelated node embeddings (e.g., math symbols).\nMemory Initialization. We construct the mem-\nory network based on the dependency triplets and\nnode representations of the math syntax graph.\nGiven the dependency triplets {(h, r, t)}, we treat\nthe head and relation (h, r) as the key and the\ntail t as the value, to construct a syntax-aware\nkey-value memory. The representations of the\nheads and tails are the corresponding node rep-\nresentations from GAT, while the relation repre-\nsentations are randomly initialized and will be\noptimized by continual pre-training. Finally, we\nconcatenate the representations of heads and rela-\ntions to compose the representation matrix of Keys\nas K(l) = {[n(l)\nh1 ; r1], [n(l)\nh2 ; r2], ··· , [n(l)\nhN\n; rN ]},\nand obtain the representation matrix of Values as\nV(l) = {n(l)\nt1 , n(l)\nt2 , ··· , n(l)\ntN }.\nMulti-view Read Operation. We read important\nsemantics within the syntax-aware memory to up-\ndate the token representations from PLM. Since\na token can be related to several nodes within\nthe math syntax graph, we design a multi-view\nread operation to capture these complex seman-\ntic associations. Concretely, via different bilinear\ntransformation matrices {WS\n1 , WS\n2 , ··· , WS\nn},\nwe first generate multiple similarity matrices\n{S1, S2, ··· , Sn} between tokens and keys (head\nand relation) within the memory, and then aggre-\ngate the values (tail) to update the token represen-\ntations. Given the token representations from the\nl-th layer of PLM H(l) = {h(l)\n1 , h(l)\n2 , ··· , h(l)\nL },\n5925\nGiven that sin xis equal to 0.6and xis an acute angle, find …\nGATLayer1\nGATLayer𝑀−1\nGATLayer𝑀\n⋯ Keys\nsin\nValues\ncompxequalobl0.6x amodacute⋯⋯\nGate\n0.6\nequal\nsin\nx\nPLMLayer1\nPLMLayer𝑁−1\nPLMLayer𝑁CLSmeanTGCLMLM DTC\nAggregateAggregateSyntax-Aware Memory Network\nToken RepresentationsNode Representations\n⋯\nx\nacute\nequalnsubjsin\namod\noblnsubj\ncomp\n0.70.3\n0.10.20.20.40.5(sin, comp)(equal, obl)\nsinx0.6\n0.3\n0.3(x, amod)\nsoftmaxsoftmax\nFigure 2: Illustration of our COMUS. We encode the textual description and the math syntax graph using PLM and\nGAT, respectively, and insert the syntax-aware memory networks in the lastk layers to fuse their representations. In\nthe syntax-aware memory network, we utilize the token representations and the node representations as the queries\nand values, respectively, and implement theread and write operations to update them.\nthe similarity matrix Si is computed as\nSi = H(l)WS\ni K(l)⊤\n(2)\nwhere WS\ni is a learnable matrix, and an entry\nSi[j, k] denotes the similarity between the j-th to-\nken and the k-th key in the i-th view. Based on\nthese similarity matrices, we update the token repre-\nsentations by aggregating the value representations\nas\nˆH(l) = H(l) + [α1V; α2V; ··· ; αhV]WO (3)\nαi = softmax(Si) (4)\nwhere WO is a learnable matrix and αi is the at-\ntention score distribution along the key dimension.\nIn this way, we can capture the multi-view corre-\nlations between tokens and nodes, and the token\nrepresentations can be enriched by the represen-\ntations of multiple semantic-related nodes. After\nthat, the updated token representations ˆH(l) are fed\ninto the next layer of PLM, where the Transformer\nlayer can capture the interaction among token rep-\nresentations to fully utilize the fused knowledge\nfrom the syntax graph.\nMulti-View Write Operation. After updating\nthe token representations, we update the represen-\ntations of nodes from GAT via memory writing.\nWe still utilize the multi-view similarity matrices\n{S1, S2, ··· , Sh}. Concretely, we compute the at-\ntention score distribution β using softmax function\nalong the token dimension of the similarity matri-\nces, and then aggregate the token representations\nas\nV(l)\nnew = [β1H(l); β2H(l); ··· ; βhH(l)]WR (5)\nβi = softmax(S⊤\ni ) (6)\nwhere WR is a learnable matrix. Based on the\naggregated token representations, we incorporate a\ngate to update the representations of the values as\nz = σ(V(l)\nnewWA + V(l)WB) (7)\nˆV(l) = z · V(l)\nnew + (1− z) · V(l) (8)\nwhere WA and WB are learnable matrices. The\nupdated node representations ˆV(l) are also fed into\nthe next layer of GAT, where the graph attention\nmechanism can further utilize the fused knowledge\nfrom the text to aggregate more effective node rep-\nresentations.\n3.3 Continual Pre-training\nContinual pre-training aims to further enhance and\nfuse the math text and math syntax graph. To\nachieve it, we utilize the masked language model\nand dependency triplet completion tasks to improve\nthe understanding of math text and math syntax\ngraph, respectively, and the text-graph contrastive\nlearning task to align and fuse their representations.\n5926\nMasked Language Model (MLM).Since the math\ntext contains a number of special math symbols,\nwe utilize the MLM task to learn it for better under-\nstanding the math text. Concretely, we randomly se-\nlect 15% tokens of the input sequence to be masked.\nOf the selected tokens, 80% are replaced with a spe-\ncial token [MASK], 10% remain unchanged, and\n10% are replaced by a token randomly selected\nfrom the vocabulary. The objective is to predict the\noriginal tokens of the masked ones as:\nLMLM =\nX\nti∈Vmask\n−log p(ti) (9)\nwhere Vmask is the set of masked tokens, and p(ti)\ndenotes the probability of predicting the original\ntoken in the position of ti.\nDependency Triplet Completion (DTC). In the\nmath syntax graph, the correlation within the de-\npendency triplet (h, r, t) is essential to understand\nthe complex math logic of the math problem. Thus,\ninspired by TransE (Bordes et al., 2013), we design\nthe dependency triplet completion task to capture\nthe semantic correlation within a triplet. Specifi-\ncally, for each triplet (h, r, t) within the math syn-\ntax graph, we minimize the DTC loss by\nLDTC = max\n\u0000\nγ+d(nh+r, nt)−d(nh+r\n′\n, nt), 0\n\u0001\n(10)\nwhere γ >0 is a margin hyper-parameter, d(·) is\nthe euclidean distance, and r\n′\nis the randomly sam-\npled negative relation embedding. In this way, the\nhead and relation embeddings can learn to match\nthe semantics of the tail embeddings, which en-\nhances the node and relation representations by\ncapturing the graph structural information.\nText-Graph Contrastive Learning (TGCL).Af-\nter enhancing the representations of the math text\nand math syntax graph via MLM and DTC tasks re-\nspectively, we further align and unify the two types\nof representations. The basic idea is to adopt con-\ntrastive learning to pull the representations of the\ntext and graph of the same math problem together,\nand push apart the negative examples. Concretely,\ngiven a text-graph pair of a math problem (di, Gi),\nwe utilize the representation of the [CLS] token\nhd\ni as the sentence representation of di, and the\nmean pooling of the node representations nG\ni as\nthe graph representation of Gi. Then, we adopt the\ncross-entropy contrastive learning objective with\nin-batch negatives to align the two representations\nLTGCL = −log exp(f(hd\ni , nG\ni )/τ)P\ni̸=j exp(f(hd\ni , nG\nj )/τ)\n(11)\nwhere f(·) is a dot product function and τ denotes\na temperature parameter. In this way, the represen-\ntations of the text and graph can be aligned, and the\ndata representations from one side will be further\nenhanced by another side.\n3.4 Overview and Discussion\nOverview. Our approach focuses on continually\npre-training PLMs to improve the understanding\nof math problems. Given the math text and math\nsyntax graph of the math problem, we adopt PLM\nand GAT to encode them, respectively, and utilize\nsyntax-aware memory networks in the last k layers\nto fuse the representations of the text and graph.\nIn each of the last k layers, we first initialize the\nqueries and values of the memory network using\nthe representations of tokens and nodes, respec-\ntively, then perform the read and write operations\nto update them using Eq. 3 and Eq. 8. After that,\nwe feed the updated representations into the next\nlayers of PLM and GAT to consolidate the fused\nknowledge from each other. Based on such an ar-\nchitecture, we adopt MLM, DTC and TGCL tasks\nto continually pre-train the model parameters using\nEq. 9, Eq. 10 and Eq. 11. Finally, for downstream\ntasks, we fine-tune our model with specific data\nand objectives, and concatenate the representations\nof text hd and graph nG from the last layer for\nprediction.\nDiscussion. The key of our approach is to deeply\nfuse the math text and formula information of the\nmath problem via syntax-aware memory networks\nand continual pre-training tasks. Recently, Math-\nBERT (Peng et al., 2021) is proposed to continually\npre-train BERT in math domain corpus, which ap-\nplies the self-attention mechanism for the feature\ninteraction of formulas and texts, and learns simi-\nlar tasks as BERT. As a comparison, we construct\nthe math syntax graph to enrich the formula in-\nformation and design the syntax-aware memory\nnetwork to fuse the text and graph information. Via\nthe syntax-aware memory network, the token from\nmath text can trace its related nodes along the rela-\ntions in the math syntax graph, which can capture\nthe fine-grained correlations between tokens and\nnodes. Besides, we model the math syntax graph\n5927\nTask Train Dev Test\nKPC 8,721 991 1,985\nQRC 10,000 2,000 4,000\nQAM 14,000 2,000 4,000\nSQR 250,000 11,463 56,349\nTable 1: Statistics of the datasets.\nvia GAT, and devise the DTC task to improve the\nassociations within triplets from the graph, and the\nTGCL task to align the representations of the graph\nand text. In this way, we can better capture graph\nstructural information and fuse it with textual infor-\nmation. It is beneficial for understanding logical\nsemantics from formulas of math problems .\n4 Experiment\n4.1 Experimental Setup\nWe conduct experiments on four tasks in the math\ndomain to verify the effectiveness of our approach.\nPre-training Corpus . Our pre-training corpus\nis collected from a Chinese educational website\nZhixue 3, which consists of 1,030,429 problems of\nhigh school math exams and tests. Each math prob-\nlem contains the information of problem statement,\nanswer and solution analysis. For data preprocess-\ning, we first transform these collected problems\nfrom the HTML format into plain text format, then\nextract and convert the formulas and mathematical\nsymbols into a unified LaTex mathematical format.\nEvaluation Tasks. We construct four tasks based\non the collected math problems for high school\nstudents, which cover math problem classification\nand recommendation. The statistics of these tasks\nare summarized in Table 1.\n• Knowledge Point Classification (KPC) is a\nmulti-class classification task. Given a math ques-\ntion, the goal is to classify what knowledge point\n(KP) this question is associated with. The knowl-\nedge points are defined and annotated by profes-\nsionals, and we finally have 387 KPs in this task.\n• Question-Answer Matching (QAM) is a bi-\nnary classification task to predict whether an an-\nswer is matched with a question. For each question,\nwe randomly sample an answer from other prob-\nlems as the negative example.\n• Question Relation Classification (QRC) is\na 6-class classification task. Given a pair of math\nquestions, this task aims to predict their relation\n3http://www.zhixue.com\n(e.g., equivalent, similar, problem variant, condi-\ntional variant, situation variant, irrelevant).\n• Similar Question Recommendation (SQR) is\na ranking task. Given a question, this task aims to\nrank retrieved candidate questions by the similarity.\nEvaluation Metrics. For classification tasks (KPC,\nQRC, QAM), we adopt Accuracy and F1-macro\nas the evaluation metrics. For the recommen-\ndation task (SQR), we employ top- k Hit Ratio\n(HR@k) and top- k Normalized Discounted Cu-\nmulative Gain (NDCG@k) for evaluation. Since\nthe length of candidate list is usually between 6 and\n15, we report results on HR@3 and NDCG@3.\nBaseline Methods. We compare our proposed ap-\nproach with the following nine baseline methods:\n• TextCNN (Kim, 2014) is a classic text classifi-\ncation model using CNN on top of word vectors.\n• TextRCNN (Lai et al., 2015) combines both\nRNN and CNN for text classification tasks.\n• GAT (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018) utilizes the at-\ntention mechanism to aggregate neighbors’ repre-\nsentations to produce representation for each node.\n• R-GCN (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) extended\nGraph Convolutional Network with multi-edge en-\ncoding to aggregate neighbors’ representations.\n• BERT-Base(Devlin et al., 2019) is a popular\npre-trained model. We use the bert-base-chinese,\nand add some new tokens into the original vocab to\nrepresent specific symbols in math problem dataset.\n• DAPT-BERT(Gururangan et al., 2020) con-\ntinually pre-trains BERT on the domain-related\ncorpus. We use our collected math problem dataset\nwith the masked language model task for imple-\nmentation.\n• BERT+GATconcatenates the [CLS] embed-\nding from BERT and mean node embedding from\nGAT as the representation of a math question.\n• DAPT-BERT+GAT replaces BERT in\nBERT+GAT with the DAPT-BERT.\n• MathBert (Peng et al., 2021) continually pre-\ntrain BERT on the math corpus with similar pre-\ntraining tasks, and revises the self-attention layers\nfor encoding the OPT of formulas.\nImplementation Details. For baseline models, all\nhyper-parameters are set following the suggestions\nfrom the original papers. For all PLM-related mod-\nels, we implement them based on HuggingFace\nTransformers 4 (Wolf et al., 2020).

And we set the number of\nsyntax-aware memory network layers k as 2 for\nour proposed COMUS.\nIn the continual pre-training stage, we initialize\nthe weights of all models with bert-base-chinese 5\nand pre-train them on our pre-training corpus with\nthe same hyper-parameter setting as follows. We\ncontinually pre-train the parameters with a total\nof 128 batch size for 100,000 steps. And the max\nlength of input sequences is set as 512. We use\nAdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) optimiza-\ntion with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and apply learning\nrate warmup over the first 5% steps, and linear de-\ncay of the learning rate. The learning rate is set\nas 1e−4. We set τ as 0.07 for our TGCL tasks.\nIt costs about 40 hours to perform the continual\npre-training on 4 Tesla-V100-PCIE-32G GPUs.\nDuring fine-tuning on downstream tasks, we use\nAdamW with the same setting as pre-training. And\nbatch size for all experiments is set as 32. The\nlearning rate is set to 3e−5 for pre-training based\nmethods, and 1e−3 for other methods.\n5https://huggingface.co/bert-base-chinese\n4.2 Main Results\nThe results of all the comparison methods on four\ntasks are shown in Table 2. Based on these results,\nwe can find:\nAs for non-pre-training methods, text-based\nmethods (i.e., TextCNN and TextRCNN) outper-\nform GNN-based methods (i.e., GAT and R-GCN).\nIt indicates that text representations are more ca-\npable of understanding math problems than graph\nrepresentations in our dataset. Overall, non-pre-\ntraining methods perform worse than pre-training\nbased methods, since pre-training based models\nhave learned sufficient general knowledge during\nthe pre-training on large-scale corpus.\nAmong the five pre-training methods, we can\nhave two major findings. First, combining PLMs\nwith GNN yields performance improvement in\nmost cases. The reason is that GNN can capture\nthe structural semantics from formulas as the aux-\niliary information to help PLMs understand the\nmath problem, but the improvement is unstable,\nsince these methods simply concatenate the rep-\nresentations of the text and graph without deeply\nfusing them. Second, continual pre-training brings\na significant improvement on all the evaluation\n5929\nKPC QRC\nMethod Acc F1 Acc F1\nCOMUS 72.6 57.9 88.9 81.4\n- w/o GAT 69.4 49.2 87.9 78.3\n- w/o BERT 41.7 27.2 64.1 39.6\n- w/o Memory 69.4 49.2 88.1 73.7\n- w/o MLM 36.5 21.9 70.2 51.2\n- w/o DTC 70.8 55.3 87.8 73.5\n- w/o TGCL 71.9 56.5 87.9 69.8\nTable 4: Ablation study of our approach on the KPC\nand QRC tasks.\ntasks. General-purpose PLMs can’t effectively un-\nderstand mathematical semantics, and it is the key\nto adapt them to the math domain via continual\npre-training.\nFinally, by comparing our approach with all the\nbaselines, it is clear to see that our model performs\nconsistently better than them on four tasks. We\nutilize the syntax-aware memory network to fuse\nand interact the representations of textual descrip-\ntions and formulas, and adopt three continual pre-\ntraining tasks to further align and enhance these\nrepresentations. Among these results, we can see\nthat our model achieves a large improvement on\nthe KPC task. A possible reason is that it requires\na deeper semantic fusion of formulas and text for\nidentifying the correct knowledge points.\n4.3 Few-shot Learning\nTo validate the reliability of our method under the\ndata scarcity scenarios, we conduct few-shot exper-\niments on KPC and QRC tasks by using different\nproportions of the training data, i.e., 5%, 10%, 20%\nand 40%. We compare our model with DAPT-\nBERT, DAPT-BERT+GAT and MathBERT.\nTable 3 shows the evaluation results with dif-\nferent ratios of training data. We can see that the\nperformance substantially drops when the size of\ntraining set is reduced. However, our model per-\nforms consistently better than the others across\ndifferent tasks and metrics. It demonstrates that our\nmodel is capable of leveraging the data more effec-\ntively with the help of the syntax-aware memory\nnetworks and continual pre-training tasks. With\n5% training data, our model exceeds the best base-\nline by a large margin. It further indicates that our\nmodel is more robust to the data scarcity problem.\n4.4 Ablation Study\nOur proposed approach contains several comple-\nmentary modules and pre-training tasks. Thus, we\nconduct experiments on KPC and QRC tasks to\n20k 40k 60k 80k 100k65.00\n71.25\n77.50\n83.75\n90.00\nKPC\nQRC\n(a) Pre-training Steps\n0 3 6 9 1265.00\n71.25\n77.50\n83.75\n90.00\nKPC\nQRC (b) GAT Layers\nFigure 3: Performance comparison w.r.t. the number of\npre-training steps and GAT layers\nverify the contribution of these modules and tasks.\nConcretely, we remove the module GAT, BERT,\nSyntax-Aware Memory Network, or the task MLM,\nDTC and TGCL, respectively.\nIn Table 4, we can see that the performance\ndrops by removing any modules or pre-training\ntasks. It shows the effectiveness of these mod-\nules or pre-training tasks in our proposed model.\nEspecially, the model performance significantly\ndecreases when we removing the textual encoder\nBERT, which implies that the text representations\nare more important for math problem understand-\ning. Besides, we can see that removing MLM also\nresults in a large performance drop, since it is the\nkey pre-training task for our text encoder.\n4.5 Hyper-Parameters Analysis\nOur proposed model contains a few parameters to\ntune. In this part, we tune two parameters and\nexamine their robustness on model performance,\ni.e., the number of GAT Layer and the continual\npre-training steps. We conduct experiments on\nKPC and QRC tasks and show the change curves\nof Accuracy in Figure 3.\nWe can observe that our model achieves the best\nperformance in 80k steps. It indicates that our\nmodel can be improved by continual pre-training\ngradually and may overfit after 80k steps. Besides,\nour model achieves the best performance with 6\nGAT layers, which shows that 6 GAT layers are suf-\nficient to capture the information in syntax graph.\n5 Related Work\nIn this section, we review the related work from the\nfollowing two aspects, namely math problem un-\nderstanding and continual pre-training of language\nmodels.\nMath Problem Understanding . Math problem\nunderstanding tasks focus on understanding the\ntexts, formulas and symbols in math domain. A\n5930\nsurge of works aim to understand the math for-\nmulas for problem solving or mathematical infor-\nmation retrieval. In a typical way, the formula is\nusually transformed as a tree or graph (e.g., Oper-\nator Tree (Zanibbi and Blostein, 2012)), then net-\nwork embedding method (Mansouri et al., 2019)\nand graph neural network (Song and Chen, 2021)\nare utilized to encode it. Besides, a number of\nworks focus on understanding math problem based\non the textual information. Among them, Math\nWord Problem (MWP) Solving is a popular task\nthat generates executable mathematical expression\nfor the math word problem to produce the final an-\nswer. Numerous deep learning based methods have\nbeen proposed to tackle the MWP task, including\nSeq2Seq (Chiang and Chen, 2019; Li et al., 2019),\nSeq2Tree (Wang et al., 2019; Qin et al., 2020), and\nPre-trained Language Models (Kim et al., 2020;\nLiang et al., 2021). More recently, several stud-\nies attempt to model more complex math prob-\nlems (Huang et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2021)\nthat require a deep understanding of both textual\nand formula semantics.\nContinual Pre-training of Language Models .\nContinually pre-training can effectively improve\npre-trained model’s performance on new domains\nor downstream tasks (Gururangan et al., 2020). To\nachieve it, most of previous works either continu-\nally optimize the model parameters with BERT-like\ntasks on domain or task related corpus (e.g., scien-\ntific (Beltagy et al., 2019) and bio-media (Lee et al.,\n2020)), or design new pre-training objectives for\ntask adaption (e.g., commonsense reasoning (Zhou\net al., 2021) and dialogue adaption (Li et al., 2020)).\nBesides, several works (Wang et al., 2020; Xiang\net al., 2020) utilize both domain-related corpus\nand new pre-training objectives for continual pre-\ntraining, or revise the Transformer structure of\nPLMs for better adaption (Ghosal et al., 2020). For\nmath problem understanding, the recently proposed\nMathBERT (Peng et al., 2021) adopts math domain\ncorpus and formula-related pre-training tasks for\ncontinual pre-training.\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\nIn this paper, we proposed COMUS, a continual\npre-training approach for math problem understand-\ning. By integrating the formulas with the syntax\ntree of mathematical text, we constructed the math\nsyntax graph and designed the syntax-aware mem-\nory network to fuse the semantic information from\nthe text and formulas. In the memory network,\nwe treated tokens from the text and triplets from\nthe graph as the queries and slot entries, respec-\ntively, and modeled the semantic interaction be-\ntween tokens and their semantic-related nodes via\nmulti-view read and write operations. Besides, we\ndevised three continual pre-training tasks to fur-\nther enhance and align the representations of the\ntextual description and math syntax graph of the\nmath problem. Experimental results have shown\nthat our approach outperforms several competitive\nbaselines on four tasks in the math domain.\nIn future work, we will consider applying our\nmethod to solve more difficult math-related tasks,\ne.g., automatic math problem solving and analysis\ngeneration. Besides, we will also consider incor-\nporating external math domain knowledge into our\nmodel to improve the understanding of mathemati-\ncal logic and numerical reasoning.\nEthical Consideration\nIn this part, we discuss the main ethical considera-\ntion of this work: (1) Privacy. The data adopted in\nthis work (i.e., pre-training corpus and fine-tuning\ndata) is created by human annotation for research\npurposes, and should not cause privacy issues. (2)\nPotential Problems. PLMs have been shown to cap-\nture certain biases from their pre-trained data (Ben-\nder et al., 2021). There are increasing efforts to\naddress this problem in the community (Ross et al.,\n2021).\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was partially supported by Beijing Natu-\nral Science Foundation under Grant No. 4222027,\nand National Natural Science Foundation of China\nunder Grant No. 61872369, Beijing Outstand-\ning Young Scientist Program under Grant No.\nBJJWZYJH012019100020098, the Outstanding In-\nnovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs 2021\nand Public Computing Cloud, Renmin University\nof China.
