Distance learning using\ndigital tools can be defined as “the use of electronic\ntechnology to deliver, support and enhance both learn-\ning and teaching and involves communication between\nlearners and teachers utilizing online content ” [2]. Dis-\ntance learning may facilitate a pedagogical transition\nfrom a teacher-centered approach in which lectures may\nresults in a one-way communication, to a learner-\ncentered approaches which involve the student ’s inter-\naction with their teachers and other students. Education\nvia distance learning with digital tools can facilitate vari-\nability in learning situations and course content [ 3, 4].\nIn nursing education, campus based lectures are a major\npart of the learning activities [5]. A campus based lecture ap-\nproach can manifest in a teaching culture and become perva-\nsive within an organization or discipline, leading to a\nreluctance to adopt new and emerging practices and tech-\nnologies [6]. Barriers to implementation and use of distance\nlearning in nursing education may be related to teachers ’\nlimited experience and knowledge in using digital tools when\norganizing learning activities. The implementation can also\nbe affected by teachers’ fear that distance education may re-\nduce or remove traditional campus based lectures [6].\nThe pedagogical transition from traditional to distance\nlearning is a challenge for nursing education. Experi-\nences from courses that included a combined peda-\ngogical approach with both distance and campus based\nlearning showed that students found campus based edu-\ncation valuable for their learning [ 7]. Compared with\ndistance learning only, a blended learning approach in-\ncluding campus based learning and distance learning,\nmay give students increased motivation in their learning\nprocess [ 8]. A literature review revealed that online\nlearning in nursing education was as effective as trad-\nitional campus based learning [ 9]. In addition, previous\nstudies reported contradictory or equivalent results re-\ngarding the benefits and hindrances of traditional cam-\npus based learning and distance learning using digital\ntools for nursing education [ 10, 11].\nAs a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak during\nspring 2020, a number of universities worldwide were\nforced to rapidly change the pedagogical approach from\ntraditional campus based learning to distance learning\nusing digital tools. This change constituted a major chal-\nlenge for both teachers and students and warrants exten-\nsive evaluation. Overall, more knowledge about students ’\nexperiences when using different pedagogical ap-\nproaches, including distance learning, is needed to im-\nprove didactic strategies in nursing education.\nTherefore, this study aimed to describe and evaluate\nnursing students ’ experiences of pedagogical transition\nfrom traditional campus based learning to distance\nlearning using digital tools.\nMethods\nDesign\nThe overall flow of events in the study and the different\nevaluation and analysis steps of the study is illustrated in\nFig. 1. This research used a combination of qualitative\nand quantitative methodologies. The evaluation started\nwith focus groups interviews, and the analysis of these\ninterviews formed the basis of the questionnaires used in\nthis study (Additional file 1), which was delivered to all\nstudents taking this class. The evaluation was performed\nimmediately after the course ended to avoid recall bias.\nThe research team, consisted of teachers involved in the\ncourse, invited students to participate in focus group\nsessions and a questionnaire after the course through\noral (video meeting) and written information (via the\nlearning platform).\nSetting, participants and description of the evaluated\ncourse\nThis study was conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden and\nincluded nursing students who participated in the sec-\nond semester during spring 2020. In general, students\nparticipating in nursing program are approximately 90%\nfemale and the vast majority are between 20 and 30 years\nold, these demographics were also observed in present\nstudy. The second semester in the Gothenburg Univer-\nsity nursing program includes three courses, starting\nwith a 3-week course on microbiology. The second\ncourse is an 11-week course called Symptom and signs of\nillness (16.5 ECTS), which focuses on a range of\nLangegård et al. BMC Nursing           (2021) 20:23 Page 2 of 10\nFig. 1 An illustration of the different phases of the study. The study is divided into two phases: The teaching and learning phase and evaluation\nand analysis phase. Each phase is divided into several steps illustrated by boxes\nLangegård et al. BMC Nursing           (2021) 20:23 Page 3 of 10\ncommon diagnoses and the pathology, symptoms and\nsigns, treatment, and nursing related to each diagnoses.\nThe semester ends with a 6-week pharmacology course.\nWhen students were in the fifth week of the second\ncourse ( Symptom and signs of illness ), the COVID-19\noutbreak resulted in the pedagogical transition from\ntraditional campus based lectures to distance learning\nusing digital tools. Originally, this course consisted of\nseveral campus based lectures, oral examinations, a writ-\nten examination, practical training on campus, and 3\nweeks of clinical practice. As of the fifth week of this\ncourse, students had experienced approximately half of\nthe campus based lectures, two oral examinations, and\ncampus based practical training. Because of the COVID-\n19 outbreak, the transition from traditional campus\nbased learning to distance learning using digital tools\nwas rapid. The lecturers scheduled for teaching were in-\nformed about the change to distance learning using\ndigital tools, but some external lecturers were not famil-\niar with using digital tools as a teaching method. The\nlecturers had to decide if they had the capability to tran-\nsition to teaching using digitals tool and prepare the\nnew learning activities within 3 weeks. Some teachers\nreadily adapted to this change, some had more difficulty\nadapting, and some declined because of an increased\nclinical burden.\nLearning activities during the distance teaching period\nWe identified three forms of learning activities during\nthe distance teaching period. The first form was elec-\ntronic live lectures, which were delivered using Zoom\nsoftware (San Jose, USA) and included slide shows or\nwhite-screen writing by the teacher. The second form\nwas pre-recorded video lectures. These lectures were\ncreated using Power Point (Microsoft, Redmond, USA),\nand included the teacher ’s narration of the slide show.\nSome teachers also included animation highlights to\nemphasize specific aspects in the slide show. The third\nform of learning activity was self-study using the course\nliterature and lecture slide shows without direct partici-\npation of the teacher. The self-study category was pri-\nmarily to accommodate the lectures that were canceled\nby clinicians that had to prioritize clinical work due to\nthe COVID-19 situation.\nFocus group interviews and qualitative analysis\nA focus group is a semi-structured group interview in\nwhich members interact and exchange their opinions and\nviews on a certain experience in an informal discussion\nthat is focused on a particular topic or issue [ 12, 13]. The\nfocus group technique is commonly used in nursing edu-\ncation research because of its capacity to generate spon-\ntaneous data on multiple perspectives, opinions, and\nattitudes of participants in a fast and efficient way [ 13].\nGroup debriefing should be used after each interview ses-\nsion to verify the initial interpretation and concurrent data\nanalysis [14].\nIn this study, interactive focus groups were used to\ncapture students ’ experiences of the pedagogical transi-\ntion from traditional campus learning to distance learn-\ning using digital tools. All students ( n = 132) were\ninvited to participate in the focus groups interviews and\nnine students agreed to participate. Two focus group in-\nterviews via video meeting were conducted by the two\nfirst authors (UL, KK) for this study to capture what the\nstudents had experienced. The focus groups consisted of\nfour students in the first group and five in the second\ngroup (Fig. 1) and lasted 60 – 70 min. The interviews were\nperformed on April 27 and 29, 2020. An interview guide\nwas developed using open-ended questions; for example:\n“How did you experience the transition from traditional\nto distance education ” and “Have the changes affected\nyour commitment to your studies? ” Follow up questions\nwere asked, such as “What has it meant for you? ” These\nquestions aimed to elicit deeper narratives where the\nstudents reflected on educational aspects and what the\npedagogical transition had meant for them. The focus\ngroup proceedings were audiotaped and transcribed. In\naddition, notes were taken during the interviews to cap-\nture participants ’ non-verbal expressions. The same re-\nsearchers moderated both groups to ensure consistency\nof perceptions and analysis of textual and non-textual\ndata.\nThe transcribed interviews and written observation\nnotes were organized and prepared for qualitative ana-\nlysis. Data were analyzed using qualitative content ana-\nlysis following the approach by Graneheim and\nLundman [ 15], as recommended for focus group re-\nsearch [ 13]. To identify similarities and differences in\nthe student ’s experiences, the text was divided into\nmeaning units by identifying sentences containing as-\npects related to each other through their content and\ncontext. The process included identification of codes\nwhich were condensed into subthemes and main themes.\nTo ensure the trustworthiness of findings, researchers\nused member checking and group debriefing, as de-\nscribed by Lincoln and Guba [ 14]. To confirm the ana-\nlysis was rigorous, the researchers documented and\nwrote extensive and detailed notes of the emergent ana-\nlytical and theoretical insights.\nQuestionnaire and quantitative analysis\nData from the focus group interviews were used to con-\nstruct a web-based questionnaire (Additional file 1). The\nquestionnaire comprised 14 items and included two\nopen-ended questions. The questions were delivered in a\nsemi-scrambled order to avoid revealing the identified\ndimensions. A Swedish version of the questionnaire was\nLangegård et al. BMC Nursing           (2021) 20:23 Page 4 of 10\nused. All students in the class ( n = 132) were invited to\nparticipate and to answer the questionnaire. A total of\n96 students choose to participate (Fig. 1). Data from the\nquestionnaire were collected using Microsoft Forms\nsoftware (Redmond, USA) during May 12 – 18, 2020.\nQuantitative data from the questionnaire were analyzed\nwith descriptive statistics using Microsoft Excel 2016\n(Redmond, USA), and presented as percentages or abso-\nlute numbers of replies. The students ’ comments in the\nopen-ended questions were used to interpret and high-\nlight the quantitative data, and are presented as quotes\nin the Results section.\nEthical considerations\nThis study did not collect sensitive personal information\nand therefore did not require formal approval from an\nethics committee [ 16]. The Head of Department\nreviewed and approved this study. An invitation to par-\nticipate in the focus group interviews and questionnaire\nwas made both orally and in writing to inform potential\nparticipants about the study and its purpose. The stu-\ndents were informed that participation in the focus\ngroup interviews or taking the questionnaire was viewed\nas informed consent. Students were informed that study\nparticipation was voluntarily and that they could end the\ninterview at any time. The students ’ participation in the\nweb-based questionnaire was also voluntary and\nanonymous.\nResults\nFocus group interviews and qualitative analysis\nThe focus group interviews provided a spectrum of ex-\nperiences regarding the pedagogical transition from\ncampus based learning to distance learning using digital\ntools. The analysis of the focus group interviews through\nqualitative content analysis resulted in meaning units\nand were condensed and labelled with 12 codes that\nwere sorted and abstracted into 9 subthemes and,\nthrough a process of interpretation, further abstracted in\nthree main themes: didactic aspects of digital teaching ,\nstudy environment , and student’s own resources.\nThe first main theme, didactic aspects of digital learn-\ning, was related to students ’ experiences of navigating in\ndigital learning environment in regard to practical and\neducational aspects of the course. This theme was di-\nvided into following subthemes: digital learning activity\npreference, and availability and information related to\ncourse content and the communication within the course .\nThe second main theme, study environment, included\nsubthemes of experiences regarding students ’ physical\nand psychosocial study environment and learning activ-\nities attendance . The third main theme, student’s own re-\nsources, reflected students’ experiences of the subthemes,\nstudy motivation and study discipline and students own\nresponsibility ( Additional Table 1). Comments for all di-\nmensions were associated with how social interactions\naffected students ’ learning process; this emerged as an\noverall theme for the three dimensions (Fig. 2).\nQuestionnaire and quantitative analysis\nThe questionnaire comprised 14 items based on the\ncodes identified in the focus groups interviews: six items\nrelated to didactic aspects of digital learning , three items\nrelated to study environment , and three items covered\nstudents’ own resources . The questionnaire also included\ntwo open-ended questions, one concerning the technical\nlimitations of distance learning using digital tools and\none devoted to general comments. These general com-\nments are presented as quotes to illustrate students ’ ex-\nperiences of the pedagogical transition to distance\nlearning using digital tools. The questionnaire was com-\npleted by 96 (74%) of the 129 students registered on the\ncourse.\nQuestionnaire results for didactic aspects of digital\nlearning\nTwo-thirds of the students reported they preferred regu-\nlar campus based education to distance learning (Fig. 3a).\nThree forms of distance learning were used in the\ncourse:\nelectronic live lectures , pre-recorded video lectures , and\nself-study. Students reported that the most preferred\ntype of learning activity was pre-recorded video lectures ,\nfollowed by electronic live lectures (Fig. 3b). However,\nsome students considered electronic live lectures the\nleast preferred type of learning activity. Few students re-\nported self-study was the most preferred type of learning\nactivity. Technical limitations of distance learning using\ndigital tools were reported by 18% of students (Fig. 3c).\nThe majority of technical limitations were related to the\ndigital tool used for electronic live lectures. Limitations\nin the teacher ’s management of the digital tool as well as\nInternet limitations were commonly reported.\nThe didactic aspects dimension also included ques-\ntions related to learning course content , student– teacher\ncommunication, and practical information related to the\ncourse content. Students were asked if the pedagogical\ntransition to distance learning using digital tools had im-\npacted their ability to learn the course content. The ma-\njority of students reported deterioration in learning\ncourse content after the transition to distance learning\nusing digital tools (Fig. 3d). Face-to-face communication\nwith teachers and classmates were experienced as im-\nportant factors for a deeper understanding of the course\ncontent.\n“It has become very clear to me that the human fac-\ntor and non-verbal communication has an impact to\nLangegård et al. BMC Nursing           (2021) 20:23 Page 5 of 10\nhow I learn. It is more difficult to understand and\nremember the information received though pre-\nrecorded video lectures because I cannot see the per-\nson who is talking. To read slides or a book does not\ngive me much if I had not seen or heard the lecture\nbefore.”\n“I think that the collaboration with my class-\nmates did not work so well. Before, I learned\nthrough discussions with classmates, asking for\nhelp and explanations. I don ’tt h i n ki ti sp o s -\ns i b l et oh a v et h es a m eo p p o r t u n i t yt h r o u g h\ndigital tools. ”\nFig. 2 Results from the focus groups interviews regarding the transition to distance teaching using digital tools. The figure visually presents the\noverall theme, social interaction, and its associations with the three main themes (within circles), which were condensed from the focus group\ninterviews. Social interaction is based on the idea that human development depends more on a person ’s interaction with the environment and\nother individuals than their personal process. The statements in italics in each dimension circle represent the 9 subthemes identified and the12\nitems covered in the questionnaire. The 2 open-ended questions are not included in the illustration\nFig. 3 Results relating to the didactic aspects of digital teaching dimension.

BMC Nursing           (2021) 20:23 Page 6 of 10\nThe pedagogical transition also impacted student–\nteacher communication , with almost two-thirds of the\nstudents reporting deterioration in this communication\n(Fig. 3e).\n“The downside is that you can ’t have a personal dia-\nlog with the teacher, to be able to go to the teacher\nand ask questions. ”\nA functional deductive approach requires accessible\npractical information related to the course .H o w e v e r ,t w o -\nthirds of the students experienced deterioration in accessi-\nbility to practical information after the transition (Fig. 3f).\n“It has been difficult to know what to learn, when\nthe lectures are held, and how to navigate in the\nlearning platform. ”\nQuestionnaire results for study environment\nThe second dimension, which included the physical and\npsychosocial study environment , was also affected by the\npedagogical transition. Students reported deterioration\nin both the physical and psychosocial study environment\n(Fig. 4a and b), although the deterioration was more pro-\nnounced for the psychosocial study environment. How-\never, other students experienced improvements in both\ntheir physical and psychosocial study environment.\n“To not be able to study at the library is also a great loss for\nme. It provides a very good study environment, with access\nto course literature and unlimited access to use printers.”\n“I think you have more time to study when you don ’t\nhave to travel back and forth to school. ”\n“I miss my classmates during the breaks and talking\nto the persons next to me. ”\nDespite the deterioration in the study environment,\nlearning activity attendance was not affected by the\npedagogical transition (Fig. 4c).\nQuestionnaire results for students ’ own resources\nThe third dimension was related to the students’ own re-\nsources and included questions about study motivation ,\nstudy discipline , and students’ own responsibility . Deteri-\noration was found in study motivation (Fig. 5a). The re-\nsponses indicated that students felt that face-to-face\nsocial interaction with other classmates was important\nfor their study motivation. Some students commented\nthat they lost their social context as students, and com-\npared this to being unemployed:\n“It feels like you are not acquiring knowledge as\nmuch as you should, which makes you feel more\nunsecure and unmotivated. ”\n“When everything is digital, and I don ’t have the op-\nportunity to meet my classmates, I don ’t have a con-\ntext. It feels like I am unemployed even though I am\nnot. Much of the motivation disappears since I get\nmy energy and motivation from meeting others. ”\nIn the absence of study motivation, a well-disciplined\nstudent may still meet the course requirements. How-\never, more than half of the students reported a decline\nin study discipline (Fig. 5b).\n“Distance teaching is not for me since I experience\nthat it is hard to keep track of everything around me\nand very hard to maintain the discipline when you\nstudy at home. ”\nThe pedagogical transition to distance learning required\nstudents to take more responsibility to understand and in-\nterpret the course requirements. It also required an in-\ncreased capability among students to sort and navigate the\ncourse information that was communicated via the learning\nplatform. The majority of st udents reported an increased\nlevel of responsibility for their own learning (Fig. 5c).\n“For me, the distance education has contributed to\nvery positive changes within me. Feeling of better\nFig. 4 Results relating to the study environment dimension during distance teaching using digital tools.

I can do everything\nin my own pace, which is not very fast. ”\nWhen students meet face-to-face on campus with\ngroup projects as a learning activity, they take different\nroles in the group. The transition to distance learning\npresented a barrier for students to identify their respon-\nsibility in a group setting.\n“The group projects are difficult to manage with\ndigital tools; this puts more responsibility on me as a\nstudent, and the question is who takes the initiative\nin the group. ”\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this study was to describe and evaluate nurs-\ning students ’ experiences of the pedagogical transition\nfrom traditional campus based learning to distance\nlearning using digital tools. The main finding was that\nthe pedagogical transition reduced students ’ opportun-\nities for social interactions in their learning process.\nEven though our results predominantly showed deterior-\nation in all three investigated dimensions, a minority of\nstudents favored distance learning using digital tools.\nTherefore, our results support a blended learning ap-\nproach, including both campus based and distance learn-\ning, which may offer pedagogical benefits, including\nimportant social interactions that amplify students ’\nlearning process and motivation.\nSimilar to other studies [ 8, 17, 18], this study\nhighlighted the importance of social interactions among\nstudents and between students and teachers as an im-\nportant part of the students ’ learning process. The im-\nportance of social interaction is not a new concept in\nteaching. This theory was first developed by Vygotskij\n[19], and introduced in Europe in 1960 as sociocultural\neducational theory. According to this theory, human de-\nvelopment depends more on a person ’s interaction with\ntheir environment and other individuals than on a per-\nsonal process. Vygotskij argued that there is a difference\nbetween what a person learns on their own and what\nthat person learns through interaction with others. De-\npending on the context in which learning occurs, a per-\nson can be either at their actual level of development or\nat their potential level of development. The actual level\nof development refers to when a person learns some-\nthing by their own power, and the potential level of de-\nvelopment is when learning opportunities increase\nthrough interactions with others with more knowledge\nand experience [ 19, 20]. The need for social interaction\nin distance education is evident, and poses a major chal-\nlenge for teachers to create learning activities that sup-\nport social interaction. For example, digital group\nassignments, digital group discussions, or group chats\nmay be good ways to increase students ’ social interaction\nin the digital environment and enable students to reach\ntheir potential level of development.\nThe first dimension of this study was didactic aspects\nin distance learning using digital tools . Digital tools in\neducation are important because they may facilitate\nlearning and also because they change how we learn\n[21]. Säljö [ 21] argued that fitting digital tools into an\nestablished way of teaching may create suboptimal learn-\ning conditions. In the present study, students were not\nalways satisfied with the digital learning activities and re-\nported difficulty finding and understanding the informa-\ntion that was communicated through the digital learning\nplatform. Therefore, the results of this study emphasized\nthe importance of adapted learning activities, clear in-\nstructions, and a visible course structure when using\ndigital tools. These results are in line with Delgaty [ 22],\nwho discussed the importance of clear guidance sur-\nrounding strategies to support changes in distance learn-\ning. The rapid transition in the context of the COVID-\n19 pandemic forced educators to incorporate digital\ntools in a course planed for traditional campus based\nteaching. A longer preparation time for the pedagogical\ntransition to digital tools might have resulted in more\npositive experiences of distance learning. It is the\nteacher’s responsibility to include a clear structure when\ndesigning learning activities that does not leave students\nFig. 5 Results relating to the student’s own resources dimension during distance teaching using digital tools. Changes experienced by the\nstudents after the implementation of distance teaching using digital tools in relation to study motivation ( a), study discipline ( b), and students ’\nown responsibility ( c). Data are based on 96 responses and presented as percentages\nLangegård et al. BMC Nursing           (2021) 20:23 Page 8 of 10\non their own in their learning process [ 17, 23]. This\nstatement was echoed in a recent publication by Porter\net al. [ 24] that described the academic experiences of\ntransitioning to blended online learning, and highlighted\nthe importance of teachers ’ preparation and planning in\nthe pedagogical transition to distance learning using\ndigital tools. Adapting learning activities to a digital en-\nvironment and improving practical information about\nthe course and the course structure are key components\nin creating successful distance learning.\nPrevious research showed that there were differences\nbetween the digital learning activities that students pre-\nferred and what leads to effective and efficient learning\n[25]. In this study, students preferred pre-recorded video\nlectures to electronic live lectures or study on their own.\nThe preference for electronic live lectures might have\nbeen reduced because of technical problems with this\nform of learning activity. The students reported that the\nmajor benefits with pre-recorded video lectures were\nthat they could be completed at any time, at their own\npace, and viewed multiple times. However, it remains\nunclear whether students learn best through pre-\nrecorded video lectures; further studies are needed to\nanswer such questions.\nIn terms of the second dimension, participating stu-\ndents stated that the lack of social interaction with other\nstudents and teachers negatively affected their psycho-\nsocial study environment. Consistent with this finding,\nWalsh [ 18] showed that reduced social interaction had a\nnegative effect on nursing students ’ mental health. In a\nuniversity environment, emphasis is placed on individual\nachievement, but students clearly stated the importance\nof social processes in how they coped with the demands\nof higher education [ 18]. Our findings and previous re-\nsearch support the idea that teachers need to develop di-\ndactic strategies that compensate for the lack of social\ninteraction to improve the psychosocial study environ-\nment in distance learning. This is especially important as\neducators have limited potential to influence the physical\nstudy environment during distance teaching.\nFinally, in the third dimension, students reported their\nown responsibility for their studies had increased as a\npositive effect of the pedagogical transition. Transition\nfrom campus based learning to distance learning placed\nmore responsibility on students ’ capacity to adapt to\nchanges associated with this transition. Salmon [ 23]\nclaimed that students need to develop new skills to man-\nage information and knowledge obtained in a digital\nlearning environment. We suggest that teachers may\nneed to take a more active role in improving digital liter-\nacy to reduce the number of students struggling with\nthe technical aspects of the digital tools. If students have\ndifficulty adapting to these changes and the new study\nenvironment in addition to academic requirements, it\nmay result in decreased motivation and high occurrences\nof issues such as anxiety, dissatisfaction, stress and social\nisolation [ 26]. In addition, Nilsson et al. [ 27] highlighted\nthe need for educational organizations to maintain stu-\ndents’ motivation, which may be more important in a\ndigital setting than a traditional setting. Further, a de-\ncrease in social interaction may lead to social isolation,\nwhich may also affect students ’ motivation. Students\nneed to maintain their motivation without the constant\ninteraction that campus based learning offers, and must\nbe disciplined to meet the course requirements, although\nstudy discipline may be difficult for teachers to influ-\nence. By creating tasks and assignments that stimulate\nstudents to interact with each other or with teachers,\nstudents’ motivation may be improved and social isola-\ntion prevented [ 17]. Blended teaching methods have\nbeen suggested as an effective method to reach students\nwith low motivation [ 28]. This also accords with previ-\nous research by Jowsey et al. [ 29] which suggests that\nwhen blended learning is delivered purposefully and ef-\nfectively in terms of managing and supporting student\nactive learning, it positively influences the achievements\nof students.\nLimitations and strengths\nThis study was limited because it was only performed\nduring a single course and at one university. It was also\nlimited in that the pedagogical transition to distance\nlearning was not pre-planned, and therefore might not\nhave been optimally designed. Few participants in the\nfocus groups and lack of validated questionnaires ad-\ndressing this research topic are also limitations. Our\nquestionnaire was based on the focus groups interviews\nresponses and had not undergone any validation pro-\ncesses. Hence, the reliability and validity are therefore\nunknown. The major strengths of this study were the\nhigh participation rate (74%) and that the same students\nexperienced the two forms of teaching within a single\ncourse.\nConclusion\nThe successful implementation of digital tools depends\non several factors, such as students ’ level of motivation\nand level of social interaction between students and\nteachers. It is clear that there is variability in students ’\npreferences for education forms and digital learning ac-\ntivities, which have an impact on how teachers design\ncourses. Therefore, a blended learning structure with\nboth campus based and distance learning using digital\ntools should be considered, with a focus on the compo-\nnents of the course that are best suited for distance\nlearning. These considerations need to reflect the topics\nunder study as well as the specific learning objectives of\nthe course. The lack of social interaction in distance\nLangegård et al. BMC Nursing           (2021) 20:23 Page 9 of 10\nlearning is a major challenge, and teachers need to cre-\nate learning activities that improve social interactions.\nDistance learning using digital tools also requires a well-\ndesigned course structure to compensate for the lack of\nsocial interaction.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s12912-021-00542-1.\nAdditional file 1.
