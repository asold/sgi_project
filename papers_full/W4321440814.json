Data are available from conclusion of\nagreement for data usage with Meltwater\ncompany. The data underlying the results\nIntroduction\nA worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus spread rapidly starting in early 2020, and had\na severe effect on millions of lives and the global economy, with varying degrees of severity\nand mortality rates, depending on factors such as comorbidities [1, 2]. Vaccinations are an\neffective way to end this pandemic [1], and multiple countries are actively vaccinating their cit-\nizens to eradicate the virus. According to the COVID-19 vaccination dataset, 43.7% of the\nglobal population had completed fully vaccination as of November 2021 [3]. This result means\nthat many countries, as well as individuals, are preparing to return to normalcy.\nSome of these vaccines were developed using transformative new technologies to exploit\nmRNA. However, the unavoidable, rare adverse events can cause concern among the general\npublic. We hope to illuminate the statistics of adverse events in this study, using real data and\nobjective methods.\nWe used Meltwater (Media Monitoring and Social Listening Platform, www.meltwater.\ncom) and Google Trends (trends.google.com/trends/) to investigate social media reactions to\nthe side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. Meltwater is a platform that provides news and vari-\nous social network services (SNSs) data concerning Twitter, blogs, YouTube, and other social\nmedia platforms, and simple data analysis. Google Trends provides data regarding the search\nvolume for various keywords searched using Google. On Meltwater, we set (“covid” and “vac-\ncine” and “side effect” not “RT”) as a search query from November 2020 to October 2021 and\nreceived 291,960 total mentions, most frequently in April. As shown in Fig 1, the keyword\nanalysis confirmed that some negative words such as risk, blood clots, and deaths were men-\ntioned. Similarly, when we analyzed the result of the search word “covid vaccine side effect” on\nFig 1. Word cloud of top 26 keywords regarding side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine from Meltwater . Keywords\ninclude negatively connoted words such as risk, blood clots, and deaths.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0282119.g0 01\nPLOS ONE\nAnalysis of COVID-19 vaccine adverse event using AI model\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02821 19 February 21, 2023 2 / 19\npresented in the study are available by login from\nthe url (https://a pp.meltwater .com/).\nFunding: Our research was supported by the\nNational Research Council of Science &\nTechnology (NST) grant, funded by the Korean\ngovernmen t (MSIP) (No. CRC-16- 01-KRICT) ; and\nit was also based on research 「A Next Generation\nSurveillance Study for Epidemi c Preparedne ss」\nfunded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

The funders had no role in study\ndesign, data collection and analysis, decision to\npublish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting interests : The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nGoogle Trends over the same period, the highest interest was found in April 2021. Various\nsymptoms showed as a result of related topics and queries. Furthermore, we confirmed that\nwhen “covid vaccine” is searched, “side effect” and “side effects covid vaccine” rank as the 7th\nmost popular related topic and 12th most popular related query, respectively. The results of\nour analysis of news, SNS, and Google searches indicated significant interest in the side effects\nof the COVID-19 vaccine.\nThe side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine exhibit various symptoms, so clear information is\ndifficult to obtain. Therefore, we applied data mining techniques to actual data about adverse\nevents to analyze the symptoms and characteristics associated with adverse events to the vac-\ncine. Other studies have pursued a similar goal of analyzing adverse events of COVID-19 vac-\ncines [4, 5]. Some focused on four of the more common adverse reactions such as cerebral\nthrombosis, Guillain-Barre ´ syndrome, myocarditis, and pericarditis [6, 7]. Moreover, other\nstudy was performed using data collected from the smartphone-based application [8] and eval-\nuated the epidemiological of post-vaccine using adverse event data [9].\nWe used the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data to analyze adverse\nevent information on various vaccines [10–13], and applied data mining methods. Data min-\ning is used in many fields to discover and extract meaningful information from big data [14].\nIn particular, association rule analysis is one of the data mining techniques to identify frequent\npatterns in transactions and to quantify their usefulness [15–17]. Recently, this technique has\nalso been shown to be useful in the biomedical field and related studies [18–20].\nWe collected the total number of vaccinations in the United States from Our World in Data\nto analyze with the VAERS data [10]. As of August 31, 2021, the total number of vaccinations\nis 369,860,644 doses, including 210,054,512 Pfizer doses (57%); 145,447,491 Moderna doses\n(39%); and 14,358,641 Jansen doses (4%).\nWe analyzed adverse case statistics, emergency room visits, fatalities, and allergy data asso-\nciated with medications or other products. The ratio of total adverse reactions was ranged\nfrom ~ 1/1200 (Pfizer) to ~ 1/500 (Janssen) and the mortality rate ranged from ~1/120,000\n(Pfizer) to ~1/43,000 (Janssen) as presented in Table 1. Although the numbers of adverse cases\nare small, anyone who has been vaccinated can be concerned about the possibility of\nexperiencing them. In other words, the actual fear index might be much greater than the inci-\ndence rate.\nIn this study, we analyzed adverse event symptoms of the COVID-19 vaccine in the VAERS\ndataset. Then we vectorized adverse event symptoms by using Word2Vec language model [21]\nand reduced the dimensionality of symptom vectors. Then we clustered the results into groups\nby using Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) unsupervised\nmachine learning model [22] and analyzed the characteristics of symptom clusters. We also\nidentified association rules between symptoms by using the Apriori algorithm [16] and used\nthe results to determine as to which symptoms may be comorbid.\nTable 1.

Moreover, the\nresults can help to relieve public anxiety of distrust and to refute false information about\nCOVID-19 vaccines.\nMethod\nData sources\nThe VAERS dataset is a vaccine adverse event dataset provided by the CDC and the US FDA\n[10]. It is a national early warning system that is used to monitor the safe administration of\nlicensed vaccines in the US. VAERS receives adverse event reports from healthcare providers,\nvaccine manufacturers, and the public through a standard form that includes partially narra-\ntive text input. The reports can be submitted by online, mail, or fax. Then medical terms are\nassigned by specialists using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)\nschema [23]. However, it is especially notable that not all VAERS reports contain complete,\nprecise, and evincible information [10]. Therefore, we excluded indeterminate values and pre-\nprocessed the data to avoid misinterpretation.\ni. The VAERS DATA dataset consists of features including ID, gender, age, vaccination date,\nand health history.\nii. The VAERS Symptoms dataset consists of adverse event symptoms by ID.\niii. The VAERS Vaccine dataset consists of ID, vaccine type, manufacturer, lot, number of\ndoses administrated, route, site, and name.\nData preprocessing\nThe VAERS datasets were merged and sorted by ID, with all duplicated ID rows being removed.\nWe extracted only data whose vaccine type is COVID-19 vaccination. We used the data period\nfrom January 1 to August 31, 2021. We analyzed 396,443 cases of adverse events to the vaccine in\nour study. We divided the age variable into categories for simplicity. To ensure accurate analysis, all\nrecords with uncertain gender, age, vaccine manufacturer, and dose of vaccinations were removed.\nIn addition, the VAERS DATA contains information on what medications the vaccine recip-\nients took; what allergies to medications, food, or other products they have; and what illnesses\nthe vaccine recipients were suffering at the time of vaccination. Because these data values are in\ntext format, the preprocessing is very important and complicated. First, data was converted to\nlowercase letters, then for tokenization, expressions like “and” and “;” were changed to “,”. Then\nwe tokenized the data into units bounded by pairs of ‘,’. To eliminate any special characters in\nthe data, we used regular expressions. Then, we compiled a list of words that meant “not appli-\ncable” such as “no”, “none”, “no reported”, “no known drug allergies” and “NKDA”, and con-\nverted these values to nulls. To remove unnecessary terminology, we used stopwords of the\nNatural Language Toolkit [24]. Furthermore, we removed inaccurate keywords in each feature.\nFor example, the allergy feature contains symptoms like vomit and fever, and medication terms\nlike disp and mg. In addition, most spelling errors and abbreviations were edited to unify word;\nfor example, ‘penicillan’, ‘penecillin’, and ‘pennicillin’ were corrected to ‘penicillin’, and ‘htn’,\n‘high blood pressure’, and ‘blood pressure high’ were unified to ‘hypertension’.\nGenerating word embeddings using Word2Vec vectorizer\nWord2Vec is a natural language processing technique (NLP) and word-embedding model\ndeveloped by Google in 2013 [21]. Word2Vec uses the statistical properties of word\nPLOS ONE\nAnalysis of COVID-19 vaccine adverse event using AI model\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02821 19 February 21, 2023 4 / 19\nrelationships in certain contexts to extract semantic information by using vector spaces.\nWord2Vec is composed of two neural network-based language models: a continuous bag of\nwords (CBOW) and a Skip-gram. The CBOW model is trained to predict the word in the cen-\nter of a sliding window by using context words. Conversely, the Skip-gram model is trained to\npredict context words in the sliding window by using the word in the center [25, 26]. Skip-\ngram model produces better performances than CBOW model on semantic tasks [21].\nAdverse events to the COVID-19 vaccine include a wide variety of symptoms, and the\nextensive range of variability of the dataset makes symptoms difficult to classify. To solve this\nchallenge, symptom-related words were vectorized to create clusters grouped together with\nsimilar symptoms, then the characteristics of the clusters were analyzed. As Word2Vec yields\ngood results for big data, it was used to generate large word vectors. There are hyperparameters\nin Word2Vec; Size means the size of the word vector; Window means the maximum distance\nbetween the current word and the predicted word; Minimum count means the minimum\ncount threshold; iteration means the number of iterations (epochs) over the corpus; sg to 0\nmeans the CBOW method, and 1 means the Skip-gram method. In our study, each hyperpara-\nmeter was set to size to 500, window to 5, minimum count to 50, iteration to 100, and sg to 1,\nwhich is the appropriate architecture because symptom words are usually infrequent [27].\nDimensionality reduction of word vectors via t-SNE\nt-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is an unsupervised learning model that\nis generally used for visualizing high-dimensional data [28]. It uses a Student-t distribution to\ncompute the similarity between two points in low-dimensional space and transforms the m-\ndimensional data set X ¼ fx\n1\n; x\n2\n; . . . ; x\nt\ng � R \nm\nto n-dimensional data\nY ¼ fy\n1\n; y\n2\n; . . . ; y\nt\ng � R \nn\n, where n�m and most commonly n = 2 or 3. We used the t-SNE\nalgorithm to reduce the dimension to 2 to visualize this word vector.\nClustering 2-D word vectors with the DBSCAN algorithm\nDBSCAN is a non-parametric, clustering technique that considers density by hierarchical clus-\ntering and partitioning methods [22]. The basic assumption of DBSCAN is that a cluster is a\nhigh-density region in the data space [29].\nWe used the DBSCAN algorithm to ensure effective clustering. Two parameters of\nDBSCAN, eps and min samples, must be set to appropriate values, because they significantly\naffect the results. For this purpose, we used the KneeLocator package provided by Python to\nfind knee points at specific minimum sample values then used them as the hyperparameter\nvalues of DBSCAN [30]. We set hyperparameters of the DBSCAN algorithm for eps to 0.686\nand min samples to 5. Twenty-five clusters were created, but Cluster 0 was composed of resid-\nual data that were not otherwise classified, and was omitted. The characteristics of each of the\nother clusters were analyzed and visualized.\nAssociation rule analysis using the Apriori algorithm\nThe Apriori is a data mining algorithm that finds patterns indicating the degree to which spe-\ncific items co-occur in one transaction; the algorithm is often used in association rule analysis\n[16]. Three scales are used to evaluate the associations as follows [31].\nSupport: The ratio of transactions that include items X and Y simultaneously among all\nitems.\nsðX¼ )YÞ ¼ P ðX; YÞ an d sðX Þ ¼ P ðX Þ\nPLOS ONE\nAnalysis of COVID-19 vaccine adverse event using AI model\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02821 19 February 21, 2023 5 / 19\nConfidence: when item X occurs, the probability that item Y will also occur.\ncðX¼ )YÞ ¼ P ðYjXÞ\nLift: A measure of whether a rule is caused by chance. If Lift is less than 1, X and Y have a\nnegative relationship; if Lift is 1, X and Y are unrelated (that is, occur randomly relative to\neach other); and if Lift is greater than 1, X and Y have a positive relationship.\nL X¼ )Yð Þ ¼\ncðX ¼ )YÞ\nP ðY Þ\n¼\nP ðX ; Y Þ\nðP ðX ÞP ðY ÞÞ\nWe performed association analysis using the Apriori algorithm to determine the regularity\nof symptoms that appear as adverse events to the COVID-19 vaccine. Minimum support is\nspecified as a hyperparameter of the Apriori algorithm, which is the minimum support value\nof an itemset that can be a frequent itemset. However, it is varied that the range of the support\ncount values of the symptom lists used as the input itemset. Therefore, if input consist of items\nthat occur at low frequency, it can complicate that the algorithm discovers a meaningful associ-\nation between them [32]. Consequently, to overcome this limitation of the Apriori algorithm,\nwe created two transaction-type input datasets and set the minimum support for each transac-\ntion. First, Transaction-1 was constructed based on symptom lists in all clusters obtained from\nDBSCAN. Transaction-2 consisted of some clusters. We set hyperparameters of transactions\nwith different minimum support thresholds as shown in Table 2. All results were displayed as\nnetwork graphs using the Plotly package in Python.\nResults\nTable 3 summarizes the VAERS data collected from January 1 to August 31, 2021. Results indi-\ncated that there were approximately 2.5 times as likely to be female (72.0%) as to be male\n(28.0%) among people who experienced adverse events without normalizing for population\nsize. Furthermore, of these people who experienced adverse events slightly more had used\nModerna (51.3%) than Pfizer (41.6%), whereas very few had used Janssen (7.1%). Most vaccine\ndoses were first and second. In addition, most of them were mainly in their 30s to 60s (67.4%);\nvery few were under 10 or over 100 years old (0.1%).\nBecause the medication, illness, and allergy data of people who experienced adverse events\nwere recorded as unstructured text from the narrative, a complex pre-processing was per-\nformed. Simple statistics for the top 30 keywords in each of the three health statuses were visu-\nalized using heatmaps, as shown in Figs 2–4. These figures represent the results of the\nnormalized counting ratio of unique values in features including gender, vaccine manufactur-\ners, vaccine does, and age for the top 30 keywords of medication, illness, and allergy,\nrespectively.\nFig 2 lists statistics for the top 30 medications of what some people who experienced adverse\nevents took at the time of vaccination. Vitamins ranked at the top, followed by thyroid medi-\ncines such as Levothyroxine and hypertension medicines including Lisinopril. For all\nTable 2.

The most common were Hypertension, Diabetes, Asthma,\nCovid, and Seasonal allergy. As in all other cases, the ratio was higher for women than for\nmen, for Moderna than for Pfizer or Janssen, and for the first dose than for the second dose.\nAdverse events were also found to be high in middle-aged and older adults, mostly between\ntheir 50s and 70s; seasonal allergy, sinus infection, migraine, headache, and anemia were high\nin those between their 30s and 50s.\nFig 4 shows the top 30 allergies what some people who experienced adverse events had at\nthe time of vaccination. Penicillin, Sulfa, Latex, Codeine, and Amoxicillin were ranked at the\ntop tier. The results were similar to those described previously; however, patients who had a\npeanut allergy experienced the highest rates with the Pfizer vaccine. The age groups were\nevenly distributed from the 30s to the 70s.\nTo summarize the data statistics of these three health history attributes, the ratios were\nhigher for women, Moderna, and the first dose vaccination than for others, and the number of\npatients who had adverse effects included a high number of those suffering from high blood\npressure, thyroid, diabetes, and heart disease.\nThe VAERS Symptoms data identified 9,415 symptoms of adverse events to the COVID-19\nvaccine; the most common were headache (97,219), pyrexia (81,095), fatigue (79,222), and\nchills (72,559). The diversity of the symptoms complicates the task of identifying and analyzing\nthem. Therefore, we approached the VAERS dataset by grouping adverse event symptoms to\nanalyze the vaccine recipients by symptoms. We vectorized the complete lists consisting of\nsymptoms of adverse events using Word2Vec. As a result, Word2Vec generated 1,560 symp-\ntom vectors. We clustered these results by using DBSCAN after reducing the dimension of\nsymptom embeddings through t-SNE. At this time, eps and min samples as the DBSCAN\nparameters were set to 0.686 and 5, respectively considering the result of KneeLocator.\nTable 3.

Cluster 10 included improper vaccination procedures such as product\nstorage error and expired product administered.\nWe summarized the representative medications, illnesses, and allergies for each cluster.\nMedications seen in many clusters included levothyroxine (a treatment for the thyroid gland),\nlisinopril (a treatment for hypertension), atorvastatin (which lowers cholesterol), and vitamins.\nAs shown in Fig 2, these medications were also among the top 30 represented in the overall\ndataset. Conversely, some medications that were not part of the top 30 (albuterol, furosemide,\npantoprazole, prenatal vitamin, and spironolactone) appeared often in specific clusters. In par-\nticular, furosemide, a loop diuretic treatment for cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure, appeared\nfrequently in Cluster 5.\nOut of the top 30 illnesses represented by the dataset, those that appeared in the most clus-\nters included hypertension, asthma, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. Conversely, illnesses out-\nside of the top 30 that appeared in specific clusters included congestive heart failure, dementia,\nDowns syndrome, glaucoma, polycystic ovarian syndrome, ADHD, and pregnancy. In partic-\nular, congestive heart failure was seen most frequently in Cluster 5, and Downs syndrome was\nseen most frequently in Cluster 20. Furthermore, polycystic ovarian syndrome and pregnancy\nappeared mainly in the female disease cluster.\nFinally, out of the top 30 allergies, penicillin, sulfa, amoxicillin, codeine, and latex appeared\nin the most clusters. Allergies outside of the top 30 that appeared in specific clusters included\natorvastatin, statin, and tree nut allergies. In particular, statin allergies were counted the most\nfrequently in Cluster 5. From the overall results, clusters associated with specific diseases\nexhibited different patterns commonly in medications, illnesses, and allergies.\nTable 5 lists the number of vaccine adverse events varied by gender and vaccine manufac-\nturer. For gender, the ratio of females was high in most clusters except 5, 9, and 15. For vaccine\nmanufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer had a similar ratio; this result differed from the initial\nresult due to the exclusion of Cluster 0. Table 5 also can be interpreted by considering average\nvalues. Clusters 6, 11, 13, 17, and 23, which all exhibited higher values than the average female\nratio, were symptom clusters related to vaccine site pain and gynecologic diseases. The Mod-\nerna ratios in Clusters 6, 13, and 20 were higher than its average ratio. For Pfizer and Janssen,\nTable 5.

Thus, the ratio in each\ncluster exhibited a slightly different ratio from the overall ratio.\nNext, the adverse events in each cluster were compared by age group. These events were\nmainly distributed in the 30s to 60s, Clusters 1, 8, 11, 17, 20, and 22 displayed a similar trend.\nHowever, Clusters 9, 15, 13, and 23 were more frequently represented by the younger group\nthan the older group, whereas Clusters 5, 6, 7, and 19 mostly consisted of the elderly. Preg-\nnancy-related Cluster 13 and menstruation-related Cluster 23 usually included a specific\ngroup (female and twenty to forty), however 9.4% of Cluster 23 were women over 50.\nFig 7.

The Apriori algorithm was used to perform two association\nanalyses with different input datasets. Because the distribution of symptoms was unbalanced\n(e.g., headache appeared 76,900 times, whereas bell’s palsy appeared 2,044 times), we built two\ntransactions with different compositions of the items. Transaction-1 included all symptoms\nobserved in DBSCAN clustering, and Transaction-2 excluded the categories of product errors,\nmedical test results, and all of cluster 0, which contained symptoms with a large number of\nappearances in common. In addition, we set the hyperparameters of each transaction differ-\nently and set the minimum support value smaller for Transaction-2, which consisted of symp-\ntoms with a low frequency of appearance, than for Transaction-1.\nFirst, we conducted the association analysis of Transaction-1 for all symptoms as shown in\nFig 6. Fig 6A displays a graph of all the rules, and Fig 6B shows an enlargement of the most con-\nnected rules of Fig 6A. Fig 6B displays an association map between the 23 most common\nadverse event symptoms. Among them, the symptom that had the highest comorbidity with\nother symptoms was headache, which was linked to 17 symptoms. The highest support value\nwas 0.087, which was represented by the {chills $ pyrexia} rule. The highest confidence value\nwas 0.858, represented by the {body temperature ! pyrexia} rule. As shown in Fig 7, symptom\nassociation patterns were statistically calculated using all symptom data and visualized as a polar\nplot. Fig 7A shows that the most common symptoms accompanying headache were pyrexia,\nchills, and fatigue. Rules with antecedent to headache also showed high support and confidence\nvalues in a similar order. Fig 7B shows that the symptoms most associated with nausea were\nheadache, chills, and fatigue. Support and confidence values of nausea for those were also high.\nTransaction-2 was constructed considering 13 clusters: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22,\nand 23. Table 6 displays examples of Transaction-2. The results of the association analysis on\nTransaction-2 are shown in Fig 8. Fig 8A shows a graph of all the rules. In Fig 8A, the area\nwith the most symptoms is shown in Fig 8B. Death was associated with the most symptoms,\nconnected to five symptom clusters in Fig 8B. The highest support value was 0.046, corre-\nsponding to the {vaccination site pruritus $ vaccination site erythema} rule. The highest con-\nfidence value was 1, corresponding to the {visual ! hallucination} rule and {auditory !\nhallucination} rule.\nConclusion\nThe VAERS data is a more useful dataset in that vaccination is an important approach to pre-\nventing ever-increasing infectious diseases along with non-pharmacological interventions.\nTable 6.

We performed symptoms\nvectorization using Word2Vec. To identify various other symptoms, we reduced the dimen-\nsion of embedding vectors and performed clustering experiments on the vectors by using the\nDBSCAN algorithm. The process identified 25 symptom clusters, but cluster 0 was a generic\ngroup, and was excluded from further analysis. Various symptoms such as pain at the injection\nsite, gynecologic disease, lung and heart disease, and death were clustered.\nFurthermore, we extrapolated that the vaccine adverse events of COVID-19 were evidently\ndifferent from the same respiratory virus, Influenza vaccine, as obtained from the VAERS\ndata. According to the data, the main symptoms of the Influenza vaccine adverse events are\ninjection site pain, pain, and pyrexia [10]. Also, the symptoms were less diverse than for the\nCOVID-19 vaccine.\nWe summarized various symptom clusters of adverse events to the COVID-19 vaccine.\nMoreover, our study concludes that symptom clusters have different characteristics according\nto gender, vaccine manufacturer, and age. For example, Clusters 9 and 15 included a higher-\nthan-average ratio of young males who received the Pfizer vaccine. Consequently, it is neces-\nsary to be aware that symptoms may appear depending on the underlying diseases (medica-\ntions, illnesses, and allergies) of the person receiving the vaccine. Notably, Cluster 5 included\nrecipients who have taken furosemide, or who have congestive heart failure, even though the\npercentages were small.\nIn addition, the results of the association analysis indicated that headache occurred with\nmild symptoms including fatigue, chills, pyrexia, and nausea. Moreover, the findings suggest\nthat death is significantly related to Cluster 19. We expect that this study can help to anticipate\nadverse events that a vaccinated person might experience, and to prepare for them.\nOur study presents overall symptoms that can appear as adverse reactions following\nCOVID-19 vaccination, and demonstrates the characteristics of groups who have specific\nsymptoms. However, our study has the limitation that the VAERS data only includes people\nwho had adverse reactions among vaccinated people. In other words, it cannot determine\nwhether adverse events will occur even if vaccine recipients have similar characteristics to the\npatient in this data. In addition, since the human body is complicated system, causal relation-\nships cannot be confirmed unconditionally.\nTherefore, our results provide overall factual information and trends that can be presented\nto people who are deciding whether to vaccinate, considering the experiences of previous\nrecipients, and can facilitate preparation for vaccination. In addition, we contribute to devel-\noping shreds of evidence to verify the authenticity of uncertain information related to adverse\nevents of COVID-19 vaccines.\nIn further studies, we expect to access additional data sources such as VAERS data from\nother countries. We will also continue to study the predictability of adverse events by using\nmachine-learning techniques with additional datasets.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: Saeyeon Cheon, Insung Ahn.\nData curation: Saeyeon Cheon, Thanin Methiyothin.\nFormal analysis: Saeyeon Cheon.\nInvestigation: Saeyeon Cheon.\nPLOS ONE\nAnalysis of COVID-19 vaccine adverse event using AI model\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02821 19 February 21, 2023 17 / 19\nMethodology: Saeyeon Cheon.\nProject administration: Insung Ahn.\nResources: Insung Ahn.\nSoftware: Saeyeon Cheon.\nSupervision: Insung Ahn.\nValidation: Saeyeon Cheon, Insung Ahn.\nVisualization: Saeyeon Cheon, Thanin Methiyothin.\nWriting – original draft: Saeyeon Cheon, Thanin Methiyothin, Insung Ahn.\nWriting – review & editing: Saeyeon Cheon, Thanin Methiyothin, Insung Ahn.\nReferences\n1.
