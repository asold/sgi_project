Introduction  \nThe evolution of technology, specifically the transition from basic process \nautomation to the realm of AI, has been nothing short of transformative (Chu et \nal., 2022; Xu et al., 2021). AI, with its cognitive mimicry of human mental \nprocesses, enables the real-time generation of original content  in the form of  \ntexts, music,  or images (Mukhamediev et al., 2022). This capacity has \nrevolutionised industries, enhancing efficiency through task and process \n \n*Corresponding author: Ramiz Zekaj, ramiz_zekaj@hotmail.com \n\n121 \n \nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter \nautomation. In the domain of education, AI's impact has been profound ; it has  \nautomated administrative tasks, acted as a  tutoring system, and promoted \ncollaborative learning for both students and educators (Çağataylı & Çelebi, 2022; \nRaj, 2022). \n \nThe application of AI in education has been widely explored across various \ndomains, and its potential has been well-documented in scholarly literature. The \nintegration of AI has been shown to boost teachers' self -efficacy in science \ninstruction ( Al Darayseh, 2023) and aid computer scientists when solving \ncomplex programming problems. Furthermore, AI -driven applications have \nexhibited promise in facilitating language acquisition, thereby aiding students in \nachieving fluency in foreign languages (Newar, 2022). \n \nDespite the transformative potential, there are numerous challenges associated \nwith AI use . AI's impact on education is tenuous  (Gunawan et al., 2021; \nHrastinski et al., 2019; Zawacki -Richter et al., 2019) and familiarity gaps impede \nthe seamless integration of AI technologies. To bridge these gaps, \ncomprehensive review studies are imperative. Although existing review papers \nhave explored various facets of AI in higher education (AIHEd), there remains a \nneed for a more holistic analysis to comprehend AI's influence across all four \neducational domains—learning, teaching, assessment, and administration —and \nmajor learning outcomes. This study aims to fill these gaps  by offering a \npanoramic evaluation on AIHEd's opportunities and challenges  to catalyse  \nimpactful discourse among researchers, policymakers, educators, engineers, and \nstudents regarding the future trajectory of AIHEd. \n \nThis paper delves into the realm of AI in higher education (AIHEd), \nencompassing intelligent tutoring systems, chatbots, robots, and automated \nassessment tools that amplify and enrich the educational experience. AIHEd \nholds immense potential to revolutioni se learning and teaching, rendering \npersonalised and adaptable learning experiences, fostering educators' insights \ninto students' learning trajectories, and enabling instant, machine -supported \nqueries and feedback.  \n \nIn this context, the central research objective is to investigate how AI integrates \nwithin the realm of faculty instructional support, including feedback generation, \ngrading systems, and tutoring mechanisms. To fulfil this aim, a meticulous \nsystematic review of scholarly articles from reliable databases such as Science \nDirect, Emerald Insight, and Springer is conducted. The study seeks to identify \nthe diverse modes of instructional support that AI effectively influences, thereby \ncontributing to a more comprehensive understanding of AI's role in enhancing \nhigher education. \n \nIn subsequent sections, this paper closely evaluates the  systematic review, the \nmethodology employed, findings, and implication s. Through this \ncomprehensive analysis, the study aims to  shed light on the transformative \npotential of AIHEd and contribute to the ongoing conversation on the future of \neducation in an AI-enhanced landscape. \n122 \n \nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter \n2. Methodology \n2.1 Selection Criteria \nIn this research study, a  robust set of criteria were followed in the process of \nscholarly article  selection. These standards made sure that the chosen articles \nadhered to the requirements of academic rigor and relevance while also aligning \nwith the objectives of the research. \n \nThe inclusion criteria stipulated that the chosen articles had to come from peer -\nreviewed journals in order to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data. \nFurther, to  guarantee that the literature was current, only journals published \nfrom 2020 were selected.  \n \nAdditionally, it was essential that the articles contained certain keywords, such \nas \"artificial intelligence,\" \"education,\" \"grading system,\" \"tutoring systems,\" \n\"feedback,\" and \"faculty instructional support,\" to ensure that they were directly \nrelevant to the research focus. This keyword requirement made it easier to \ninclude articles that directly contributed to the investigation of how artificial \nintelligence can support instructional faculty. \n \nArticles that did not contain the designated keywords were also disqualified as \nthey did not adhere to the established research framework.  To ensure the \ncredibility of the sources, exclusion criteria, on the other hand, covered academic \narticles from journals without a peer review. Journals published before 2019 \nwere ignored in favour of the most recent and ongoing research developments. \nThis research study's foundation is a cohesive, trustworthy, and pertinent \ndataset of scholarly articles built using carefully determined selection criteria. \nThe integrity and reliability of the research findings were guaranteed by \nadherence to these criteria.  After initially scrutinising and reviewing 171 \njournals, a total of 52 articles were included in the selection. \n \n2.2 Search Strategy \nThe search strategy used in this study sought to comprehensively compile \nacademic articles from reputable databases recognised for their credibility and \nimpact. In order to do this, a methodical search of databases like Science Direct, \nTaylor & Francis, and Emerald Insight was required. Due to their track record of \nhosting peer-reviewed journals and publications pertinent to the research field, \nthese databases were chosen. The search strategy used targeted queries with \nwords and phrases related to the study's subject. The researchers made sure that \narticles directly related to the use of artificial intelligence in instructional faculty \nsupport were retrieved with this targeted approach. \n \n2.3 Construction of the Database \nEach scholarly article that was located using the search strategy was carefully \nexamined and evaluated as part of the database construction process. All articles \nunderwent a thorough evaluation to determine the quality of content, relevance \nto the research objectives , and compliance with the predetermined selection \ncriteria. \n123 \n \nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter \nThe use of keywords within the articles was given special consideration when \nthe database was being built. The presence of pertinent keywords, as described \nin the research framework, was a key factor in choosing the articles for inclusion. \nThis step was crucial in ensuring that the chosen articles offered insightful \nanalysis of the research topic and added to the overall breadth of the review. \n \n3. Results \n3.1 Location of Studies \nThe studies used in this research came from reputable, international scholarly \ndatabases. Databases with a large selection of peer -reviewed journals and high -\nimpact publications, like Science Direct, Taylor & Francis, and Emerald Insight, \nwere selected. The richness of the study's findings was increased by the \nperspectives on artificial intelligence in instructional faculty support that these \ndatabases offered.  \n \nThe majority of the scholarly articles used in this study's sources came from the \nScience Direct database. Figure 1 displays a breakdown of database usage when \nexamining the  relationship between artificial intelligence and faculty \ninstructional support. \n \n \nFigure 1: Contribution of Databases \n \nTable 1 lists the top contributing papers and authors in the fields of instructional \nfaculty support and artificial intelligence based on the total number of citations. \nIn light of this, the list also showed that at the time of writing (2021), the Ouyang \narticle \"Artificial Intelligence in Education: The Three Paradigms\" had 102 \ncitations overall. \n \nTable 1: Highest citations per paper \nPaper Year Author Citation \nArtificial intelligence in \neducation: The three \nparadigms \n2021 Ouyang, F. & Jiao, P. 102 \n5\n38\n2 4 3\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nResearch\nGate\nScience\nDirect\nSpringer Others Emerald\nInsight\n124 \n \nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter \nStudent engagement with \nautomated written corrective \nfeedback (AWCF) provided \nby Grammarly: A multiple \ncase study \n2020 Koltovskaia, S. 98 \nA multi-perspective study on \nArtificial Intelligence in \nEducation: grants, \nconferences, journals, \nsoftware tools, institutions, \nand researchers \n2020 Chen, X., Xie, H., & \nHwang, G.-J. 97 \nSo what if ChatGPT wrote \nit?” Multidisciplinary \nperspectives on \nopportunities, challenges \nand implications of \ngenerative conversational AI \nfor research, practice and \npolicy \n2023 \nDwivedi, Y.

Each chosen article underwent a \nthorough evaluation that considered its calibre as well as how well it \ncomplemented the methodology and research focus. Useful insights were \ngathered from a variety of sources thanks to the systematic approach's use of  \ninformation organisation and synthesis. \n \nThis study's decision to use the systematic literature review methodology was \ninfluenced by the research questions it aimed to answer. The transparency, \naccuracy, and replication of the chosen methodology are directly related to the \nstudy's objectives, which include a thorough investigation of AI's role in \nassisting instructional faculty. The systematic approach solidifies a compelling \nargument by combining data from various sources  to mirror  the evolving \nlandscape of AI and its impact on educational support. This methodology \nenables a thorough examination of pertinent scholarly literature, illuminates \ncrucial patterns and emerging trends, and provides a solid framework to \naddress the research questions. \n \nA thorough overview of how artificial intelligence can improve the capabilities \nof academic faculty was successfully provided by the systematic literature \nreview approach  when addressing the  research questions. AI’s potential for \nreplication, openness, and meticulousness are the review’s strongest points. \n \n3.3 Source of Data \nFor the purpose of this study, data were gathered from a variety of scholarly \nsources, including journal articles  and reliable online references. Collectively, \nthese sources increased the dataset's depth and breadth. Editorial notes, white \npapers, and commentary were purposefully left out to ensure data accuracy. \nThis methodical approach gave precedence to literature that had undergone \nacademic validation and peer review s, upholding the validity of the research \nfindings and the scholarly integrity of the authors. To develop a thorough \nunderstanding of the ways in which artificial intelligence can assist academic \nfaculty, the chosen data sources were carefully analysed. \n \n4. Discussion \n4.1 Artificial Intelligence \nArtificial Intelligence is defined as a technological advancement that mimics \nhuman reasoning, providing ideas and information while streamlining processes \nand reducing the need for human intervention (Bozkurt et al., 2021). It combines \nscience, robust datasets, algorithms, machine learning, and expert systems. \n126 \n \nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter \nThe application of AI in different sectors has been extensive. Gupta et al. (2023) \nemphasised its importance in clinical services, specifically in handling big data \nto improve healthcare practices. Di  Vaio (2023) highlighted AI's role in supply \nchain management , inventory organi sation, and logistics. The use of AI in \neducation, according to Keiper (2023), led to  more precise answers to brief \nquestions and increased grammatical accuracy. \n \nWhile there are many benefits to AI, some authors have expressed concerns \nabout its drawbacks. According to Horodyski (2023), one disadvantage of the \nhiring process is the lack of human discretion. Tableau (nd) pointed out that AI \nusage can be costly, particularly when considering the  risk of machine \ndegeneration. \n \nThe complexity of AI and the potential for data processing, automation, and \nbetter decision -making to advance a number of industries are highlighted by \nthese findings overall. Care should be exercised  in order to address the \nchallenges and limitations related to its implementation. Further research and \nongoing advancement in this field are necessary to comprehensively understand \nthe potential benefits of AI and minimise its drawbacks. \n \nThe analysis of AI's advantages and disadvantages demonstrates the diversity of \nthis technological advancement. Horodyski's concerns surrounding the lack of \nhuman discretion remind us of the ethical issues, even though it is undeniable \nthat AI has the potential to improve healthcare, supply chains, and education. \nThe need for sustainable AI implementation is highlighted by Tableau's mention \nof cost and machine degeneration. Further, the importance of a balanced \napproach to AI adoption —one that maximi ses its benefits while addressing \nchallenges and ethical implications—is stressed by this discussion. \n \n4.2 Artificial Intelligence and Education \nExisting academic literature makes a convincing case for the relationship \nbetween artificial intelligence and education. Al Darayseh (2023) investigated \nthe adoption rate of AI usage among science educators by highlighting its \npotential to enhance instructional techniques. Cooper (2023) promoted the use of \nmore effective assessment methods by highlighting the value of AI as a tool for \ndeveloping quizzes, units, and rubrics. The use of AI in education for student \nlearning, teaching strategies, management, and assessment was examined by \nChiu (2023). \n \nJimenez (2021) also highlighted the potential for AI-powered intelligent tutoring \nsystems to aid teachers and students in fully comprehending lessons. This serves \nas an example of how artificial intelligence can support personalised and flexible \nlearning environments. In his study of the six levels of teaching and AI usage, \nHuang (2021) focused on the potential of AI to improve instructional strategies \nand academic results. Conversely, Mertala et al.’s (2022) study reveals that the \nusage of artificial intelligence tools in education requires further knowledge on \ntechnology as oftentimes both learners and students are misled by the \ninformation these tools provide. \n127 \n \nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter \nThese findings collectively suggest that the util isation of AI in education holds \npromise for enhancing teaching practices, promoting personali sed learning \nexperiences, and optim ising administrative processes. AI -driven tools and \nintelligent tutoring systems have the potential to facilitate more effective \ninstruction, enable adaptive learning, and foster improved educational \noutcomes. It is evident that the application of AI in education is a dynamic area \nof research, with studies showcasing the benefits and possibilities that AI offers \nto educators and learners. \n \nThe research examined in this section sheds light on the revolutionary potential \nof AI in education. The different viewpoints, which range from improving \ninstructional methods to individuali sed learning through intelligent tutoring \nsystems, highlight AI's adaptability to different educational needs. The need for \neducators and students to be knowledgeable about these tools' capabilities is \nemphasised by Mertala's caution about the limitations of AI tools. With the \ncaveat that proper training and ongoing research are necessary for effective \nintegration, this section discusses AI's potential to reshape education. \n \n4.3 Artificial Intelligence and Instructional Faculty Support \nIn this study, several articles were reviewed and analysed to further understand \nthe connection between artificial intelligence and instructional faculty support. \nAs elaborated in the previous literatures, instructional faculty support involves \nfeedback generation, grading and scoring infrastructure, and tutoring systems. \nWith artificial intelligence, these forms of instructional support can be processed \nfaster with increased efficiency. \n \nArtificial intelligence has been shown to enable process improvement, enhance \nteaching practices, and offer innovative solutions for faculty members. Several \nauthors discussed the presence of artificial intelligence in education, \nemphasising the need to address ethical concerns and algorithms in the future \n(Alqahtani et al., 2023). The use of artificial intelligence in the classroom and \nfaculty members' self -efficacy, attitudes, benefits, and behavioural intentions \nwere found to be positively correlated by Al Darayseh et al. (2023). \n \nSimilar results were seen in the study by Halagatti (2023), which highlighted the \nadvantages of integrating AI in schools. AI facilitates continuous, seamless, and \njust-in-time feedback on students' performance, which improves the learning \nprocess. One well-known AI programme discussed in the literature is ChatGPT, \nwhich was found to facilitate knowledge access through its human -like \nconversation interface (Deng et al., 2023).  \n \nThe potential of AI to assist instructional faculty in education is highlighted by \nthese findings. By providing prompt feedback and expanding access to \ninformation, the incorporation of AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, can \npromote more efficient and individuali sed learning experiences. It is clear that \nAI has the potential to improve instructional strategies, encourage student \nengagement, and generally raise academic standards. \n128 \n \nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter \nAn optimistic picture of AI's effects on instructional faculty support is presented \nby the research synthesis in this section. The associations between faculty \nattitudes and AI usage have been found to positively highlight AI's potential to \npromote more effective teaching methods. The continued need for personali sed \nlearning is supported by the emphasis on timely feedback and individual \nlearning experiences. The discussion suggests that AI can be a catalyst for \npedagogical innovation, although the ethical and algorithmic concerns raised by \nAlqahtani et al. remind us that responsible integration is imperative. \n \n4.4 Artificial Intelligence and Tutoring Systems \nOne type of identified instructional support available for faculties in this study is \ntutoring systems. Tutoring systems are sophisticated, knowledge-based \nstructures that aim to provide human-like knowledge. \n \nThis study reveals some literatures published in the past that discuss the linkage \nbetween artificial intelligence and tutoring systems. For instance, Mahdaoui ’s \n(2022) study focused on the benefits of including artificial intelligence in tutoring \nsystems as a technique to create better rapport with students. On the other hand, \nSpitzer (2023) explored the possibilities of creating  seamless tutoring systems \nduring the height of pandemic in Austria. Consequently, Gobert (2023) and \nCastro-Schez (2021) also explored the potential of building competencies and \nnew idea generation in the field of education.  \n \nOther literatures also discuss AI benefits : Arnau- González (2023) talks of  \nintroducing a RASA framework to create better dialogue flow and Newar (2022) \ndetails how AI can troubleshoot and debut a certain programming language . \nGan’s (2022) study also introduced a new model (KIEDLKD) that provides \ndiagnosis and proficiency assessment for students to the faculty members. \n \nThe exploration of AI -powered tutoring systems opens a realm of possibilities \nfor personali sed education. Mahdaoui's focus on rapport, Spitzer's adaptation \nduring the pandemic, and the potential for building competencies showcased by \nGobert and Castro -Schez underscore AI's versatility in enhancing various \neducational dimensions. The mention of AI's role in dialogue flow and \ntroubleshooting demonstrates its potential to create more engaging and effective \nlearning experiences. However, as studies show, continuous monitoring and \nfine-tuning are necessary to ensure AI's positive impact. \n \n4.5 Artificial Intelligence and Feedback \nOne of the identified instructional supports available for faculties in this study is \nfeedback generation. Feedback serves as an important aspect of faculty support \nthat is given to a student to further improve its performance.  \n \nIn this study, there were several related literatures that were selected to better \nunderstand the linkage of artificial intelligence and feedback generation. For \ninstance, Iftikhar (2022) explored an exploratory sequential framework in \nevaluating MT-FDP in the faculty’s training program me at a university level in \nPakistan. Zarei’s (2023) study examined the integration of artificial intelligence \nwith improvements for feedback on emerging sociotechnical systems. \n129 \n \nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter \nPannekoeke (2023) explored feedback generation using simulation -based \nlearning in the healthcare industry. Consequently, Kazemier ’s (2021) study \nrevealed that artificial intelligence helps in the development of futures literacy \n(FL) through instructional strategies and further research. \n \nMeanwhile, findings from Celik ’s (2023) study show that there is a need for \nintegration and the combination of technological and pedagogical knowledge \nwith artificial intelligence tools to generate better educational purposes. \nMoreover, Udupa’s (2022) study revealed that through artificial intelligence, \nfaculty members can provide just-in-time and seamless feedback to the students. \nThe integration of AI in generating feedback presents both opportunities and \nchallenges. The varied applications, from faculty training to simulation -based \nlearning, highlight AI's potential to enhance both theoretical and practical \naspects of education. The emphasis on combining technological and pedagogical \nknowledge, as discussed by Celik, points to the importance of holistic AI \nimplementation. While the promise of just -in-time and seamless feedback by \nUdupa is compelling, the potential for errors and misclassifications, as noted by \nRivera-Trigueros (2021), serves as a reminder of AI's current limitations. This \nsection reinforces the view that AI can significantly improve educational \nprocesses, but careful design and continuous refinement are crucial for its \nsuccess. \n \n4.6 Artificial Intelligence and Grading Systems \nAnother important aspect of instructional faculty support is the grading systems \nprovided to the students. T he t imely release of grades is considered to be a \ncrucial task for faculty members to help students and faculty members assess \nwhether a certain subject matter is understood well or if there is  still a need for \nsome improvements. \n \nIn this study, the researcher was able to locate selected scholarly articles that \ndiscuss the linkage between artificial intelligence and grading systems. For \ninstance, Ramnarain -Seetohul (2022) explored the usage of automated essay \nscoring systems (AES). Ramesh (2021) also supported this idea by stating that \nautomated scoring systems reduce consumption time  and address reliability \nissues but lack  cohesion and coherence on tested essay exams. Uto (2021) also \nexamined the reliability of automated essay scoring (AES) using a deep neutral \nnetwork (DNN -AED) method. Aside from the reliability issues, Mizumoto \n(2023) also tested the accuracy of the grammar and language translation of the \nexams using GPT. \n \nMeanwhile, Zarei (2023) assessed the integration of artificial intelligence with \nthe improvements for feedback on emerging sociotechnical systems. Rivera -\nTrigueros (2021), on the other hand explored the use of artificial intelligence as \nan aid to check foreign language exam s but later revealed that more than half of \nthe tested materials resulted in errors and misclassifications. \n \n \n \n130 \n \nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter \n5. Conclusion \nThis paper set out on a thorough exploration of the field of artificial intelligence \nin higher education (AIHEd), examining its plethora of potential applications to \nimprove administrative, teaching, learning, and assessment procedures. AIHEd \nhas established itself as a dynamic field with promising prospects, despite not \nbeing without its difficulties, as is clear from the systematic review of scholarly \narticles. \n \nAs this study comes to a close, it is clear that the nexus of artificial intelligence \nand higher education (AIHEd) has the power to fundamentally alter the way \nthat education is practiced. A thorough agenda for future research must be \nestablished in order to fully reali se this potential and address the challenges it \npresents.  \n \nThe investigation of novel theoretical perspectives is one of the directions for \nfuture research in AIHEd. Although the applications and effects of AI in \neducation have been discussed in existing literature, new theoretical frameworks \nthat delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of AI's \ninfluence are still needed. This is to think of  AI not just as a tool but also as a \ntransformative force that engages with cognitive processes, educational theories, \nand pedagogical practices.  \n \nFuture research can concentrate on a variety of educational contexts, including \ninformal learning environments, online learning platforms, and career training \nprogrammes. Examining how AI affects various learning scenarios, such as \nlifelong learning and professional development, can reveal opportunities and \nchallenges specific to particular contexts.  \n \nAnother crucial area for future research is the investigation of novel \nrelationships and constructs within AIHEd. This requires exploring new \nvariables and factors that affect how AI technologies are integrated and impact \neducation.  \n \nNew data collection and analysis methods must be developed in order to keep \nup with the rapid advancement of AI technologies. The use of chatbots, \nintelligent tutoring systems, and AI -driven educational platforms should all be \nconsidered for future research, and novel methods of collecting and analy sing \nthe data they produce should be investigated.  \n \n6.
