Chimpanzees ( Pan troglo-\ndytes) in Africa use a di Verent combination of stones as\nanvils and hammers to crack nuts (Matsuzawa 1994). Stone\ntool use has also been observed in wild cebus monkeys\n(Cebus libidinosus ) in South America (Fragaszy et al.\n2004; Moura and Lee 2004) and long-tailed macaques\n(Macaca fascicularis) in Asia (Malaivijitnond et al. 2007).\nThe type of tool used by these primates is called a “motor\ntool” (Asano 1994; Yamazaki et al. 2009) and can enhance\nthe animals’ motor abilities. Considering that Old and New\nWorld monkeys evolutionarily divided more than\n33 million years ago (Glazko and Nei 2003), it is possible\nthat they developed di Verent tool-use behaviours due to\nethological factors in their habitats. In fact, the motor tool is\nwell developed among animals, such as crows (e.g. Hunt\n1996).\nHowever, evidence of spontaneous tool use is very lim-\nited in both Japanese macaques ( Macaca fuscata) (but see\nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this \narticle (doi:10.1007/s00221-011-2778-9 ) contains supplementary \nmaterial, which is available to authorized users.\nY.

In the training procedures\napplied in our studies, the spatial relationship between tools\nand food items was carefully arranged to allow the animals\nto move the tool appropriately to get the food items. Using\nthese procedures, naive Japanese macaques quickly learned\nto manipulate the rake-like tools within 2 weeks (Quallo\net al. 2009; Yamazaki et al. 2009). This suggests that pri-\nmates that do not use tools in the wild may be equipped\nwith brain mechanisms that support the learning of novel\ntool-use behaviours, if given the appropriate training.\nIn the present study, we sought to broaden our under-\nstanding of how tool-use behaviours can be manipulated in\nthe common marmoset, a New World monkey. There has\nbeen no report of tool usage in common marmosets in the\nwild. If common marmosets can successfully learn to use\ntools, as macaques can, then the common marmoset could\nbe used to further investigate the molecular basis for the\nacquisition of novel behaviours involving changes in neural\ncircuitries and morphologies (e.g. Iriki et al. 1996; Ishib-\nashi et al. 2002; Hihara et al. 2006; Quallo et al. 2009) in\ntransgenic marmosets (Sasaki et al. 2009).\nPrevious reports have suggested that marmosets can dis-\ncriminate between objects based on the presence or\nabsence of a physical association and can learn relevant\naspects of the objects’ spatial relationships (Yamazaki\net al. 2011). In a task used to examine the understanding of\nphysical associations, an object is placed out of a subject’s\nreach and rests on a cloth that is within the subject’s reach.\nThe test entails observing whether the subject pulls the\ncloth supporting the object to obtain the object, thereby\ndemonstrating an understanding that the object on the cloth\nwill move closer when the supporting cloth is pulled. The\nsubject is required to understand that the object is resting\non the supporting cloth and would not be pulled closer if it\nwas only in contact with the cloth or covered by the cloth.\nIn the case of the rake, which was used as a tool in the pres-\nent study, a similar understanding of the physical relation\nbetween objects is required; in other words, the attractive\nobject (e.g. the food item) is contacted and supported by\nthe rake tip on the table. The objective of the support prob-\nlem is to assess the subjects’ ability to discriminate\nbetween alternatives depending on the support. Similarly,\nthe rake problem requires the subjects to understand the\nrelation of the support between two objects and to modify\nthis relation by voluntarily manipulating the tool. Thus, the\nsuccessful training of tool use would support the notion\nthat these animals can comprehend support from both the\nproduction (tool use) and recognition (discrimination of\nsupport) perspectives.\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\nFive adult female common marmosets (subject 1, 2, 3, k1\nand k3), weighing approximately 310–460 g, were used in\nthe experiments. The animals were laboratory-born, and\ntheir ages ranged from 1 y 3 m to 2 y 4 m at the beginning\nof the experiment (see Table 1). Subjects 1 and 3 were\nraised by human caretakers. The other 3 animals were\nraised by their parents at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute\nin Wako (hereafter referred to as RIKEN). All animals were\nhoused individually in a breeding room on a 12-h light–\ndark cycle. The temperature and humidity in the breeding\nroom were kept, on average, at 27°C and 50%, respectively.\nTesting sessions were always conducted a few hours before\ndaily feeding. The animals we re fed regularly, and water\nwas freely available in their cages.\nThis study complied with the current laws of Japan,\nincluding the Act on Welfare and Management of Animals.\nAll experimental procedures and handling methods were\nperformed in accordance with the “Guidelines for Conduct-\ning Animal Experiments” of RIKEN. The experiments\nwere approved by the Animal Experiment Committee at\nRIKEN.\nApparatus\nThe experimental chamber was 42 (h) £ 34 (w)£ 35 (d) cm\nand was made of stainless steel. At the bottom of the front\npanel, there was an aperture [26 (w) £ 2 (h) cm] through\nwhich the subjects could extend their forearms and hands to\nmove the tool to retrieve food items (described below). The\naperture was shaped like a comb with 2 £ 5 cm teeth. The\nexperimental materials, such as the rake-shaped tool and\nthe food items, were placed on a black acrylic table\n[9.5 (h) £ 35 (w) £ 24 (d) cm], which was connected to\nthe experimental chamber thr ough the aperture. The height\nof the table surface was 5.7 cm above the Xoor of the exper-\nimental chamber, so that the subjects could manipulate the\nrake in a sitting position.\nThe tool was shaped like a rake, with a 4.0 (w) cm £\n2.5 (h) cm white acrylic tip connected to an aluminium rod,\n7.0 cm length in total (see Fig. 1a). The tip was connected\nto the rod with dental plastic and was painted light green, so\nTable 1 Age of the subjects at the beginning of the experiment\ny Year, m month\nSubject 1 2 3 k1 k3\nA g e 2y  4m 1y  3m 1y  3m 2y  2m 1y  9m\nExp Brain Res (2011) 213:63–71 65\n123\nit would be easily detected by tracking software. As\ndescribed below, the size of the tool tip was reduced to\n4.0 cm (w) £ 1.5 cm (h) in Stage 4 of the tool training pro-\ntocol. There was a handle, made of dental plastic, on the\nedge of the rod [2.0 cm (w) £ 1.5 cm (d)], so that the mar-\nmosets could manipulate it to move the tool to the desired\nposition.\nPieces of fruit-Xavoured sweet jelly (coloured red, green\nand yellow) of roughly 0.5 cm in length were used as rein-\nforcers for the marmosets. The colour of the food item had\nno relation to any speci Wc condition; they were randomly\npresented to the marmosets.\nBecause the subjects were quite nervous when they were\nalone in the experimental chamber, we placed another mar-\nmoset in a cage [27.5 (h)£ 23.0 (w) £ 42.0 (d) cm] near the\nexperimental chamber. The companion animal could see the\nexperimental marmoset; however, it could not see the details\nof the experimental conditions because the cage was placed\nin a lower position than the experimental chamber.\nDuring the experimental sessions, the subject’s behav-\niour was recorded using video cameras (HDR-HC9; Sony,\nTokyo, Japan) that captured side views (from the left) and\ntop views. These videos were integrated into one output\nthrough a multiviewer unit (MV-400, FOR-A). The video-\ntapes were used to count the number of successful trials. In\naddition, specialised software (Ethovision 3.0, Noldus)\ntracked the tool trajectory in the video recordings.\nProcedure\nTo habituate the subjects to th e experimental situation and\nset-up, we Wrst transferred them from the breeding room to\nthe experimental chamber using a carrying cage and then\nfed them jelly for several days. Once they were consistently\ncoming to the experimenter’s hand to retrieve the food, the\nexperimenter introduced the rake on the table and put a\npiece of food on its tip to en courage the animals to pull the\nrake to get the food item. After the animals repeatedly\nFig. 1 a Rake-shaped tool used by common marmosets in the training\nsessions. The tool has a 4 £ 2.5 cm rectangle tip connected to the rod\nwith dental plastic, which was painted light green, so that it would be\neasily detected by tracking software.

The training protocol consisted of 4 stages. Each\nstage consisted of several steps, as indicated by the Arabic number\nnext to the food item (in orange). In Stage 1, the food item was placed\ninside the tool tip. It was placed 1 cm from the edge of the tool tip, with\n0, 1 and 2 cm vertical distance for steps 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The\nfood was placed on the edge of the tip in step 4. In Stage 2, the food\nitems were placed 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 cm horizontally apart from the edge\nof the tool tip in steps 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. In this stage, the ver-\ntical distance from the tool tip to the food was 1 cm. In Stage 3, the\nfood items were placed on the opposite side of the tool tip. There were\nfour steps in Stage 3, with increasing vertical distances from the edge\nof the tool (0, 0.5, 1 and 2 cm, respectively). The horizontal distance\nwas set at 1 cm. In Stage 4, the food item was placed behind and above\nthe tool tip. The horizontal distance relative to the tool edge was 0 (at\nthe edge), 1 and 2 cm in steps 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The vertical dis-\ntance from the tool tip was set at 1 cm. Note that the conditions where\nthe food items were placed to the right of the tool were trained Wrst for\nsubjects 1, 2 and 3 in Stages 1 and 2.

The protocol had four main stages; the relative posi-\ntions of the food item and the tool varied across the stages.\nFigure 1b is a top view of the tool and the food item, show-\ning the di Verence in the positional relationship between\nthem in these stages. Each stage contained several steps\n(indicated by the Arabic nu mber near the food items in\nFig. 1b), which varied in terms of the distance that the sub-\njects had to move the tool. In Stage 1, the food item was\nplaced at the side of the tool tip closest to the subjects, so\nthat the subjects were rewarded if they pulled the tool\nstraight. In Stage 2, they were required to move the tool to\nthe left or right in addition to pulling the tool forward. In\nStages 3 and 4, they had to learn to move the tool forward\nfrom the original position to get the food item, which was\nplaced far away from the tip of the tool.\nStage 1\nFigure 1b shows a schematic representation of the spatial\nrelation between the tool and the food item in each stage of\nthe training. In Stage 1, the food item was placed inside of\nthe tool tip. If the animal pulled the tool forward, then the\nfood item was likely to be retrieved. The vertical distance\nbetween the tool tip and the food item was 0 cm (i.e. the food\nitem was in contact with the tool tip) in step 1 of Stage 1 (for\nconvenience, step 1 of Stage 1 is described as “Stage 1–1”\nhereafter), 1 cm in Stage 1–2 and 2 cm in Stage 1–3. In these\nsteps, the horizontal position of the food item was 1 cm from\nthe edge of the tool tip. In Stage 1–4, the vertical position of\nthe food item was 1 cm from the tool tip, and the horizontal\nposition was 0 cm (i.e. just beneath the edge of the tip).\nStage 2\nIn this stage, the animals were  required to pull the tool for-\nward and to the left or right to cover areas where the tool tip\nwas not accessible with a straight pulling movement. There\nwere four steps in Stage 2, with increasing horizontal dis-\ntances from the edge of the tool to the food item (0, 0.5, 1 and\n2 cm in Stage 2–1, 2–2, 2–3 and 2–4, respectively). The ver-\ntical distance from the edge of the tool was set at 1 cm.\nStage 3\nIn Stage 3, the subjects were required to push the tool\nvertically. There were four steps in Stage 3, with increasing\nvertical distances from the edge of the tool to the food item\n(0–2 cm). The horizontal distance was set at 1 cm.\nStage 4\nIn the Wnal stage of the training, the subjects were required\nto retrieve the food item from behind the tool tip. In the Wrst\nstep of the stage, the food item was placed 1 cm behind and\nabove the tool tip, at the same position as the edge of the\ntool tip. Then, the horizontal  distance relative to the tool\nedge was increased to 1 and 2 cm in steps 2 and 3, respec-\ntively. The vertical distance from the tool tip was set at\n1 cm in both steps. In steps 2 and 3, the food item was com-\npletely hidden by the tool tip at the beginning of the trial;\ntherefore, the subjects were occasionally reluctant to move\nthe tool and retrieve the food item. Thus, during these steps,\nwe reduced the upper area of the tool tip to 4 cm £ 1.5 cm\nto make it easier for the animals to Wnd the food item\nbehind the tool tip. If they were reluctant to work, we\nrepeatedly showed them the food item and then put the tool\nin place after we conWrmed that the animals were interested\nin the food item.\nWe applied two di Verent sequences of training steps\nduring Stages 1 and 2. For subjects 1, 2 and 3, the food\nitems were placed to the right of the tool until Stage 2. In\nthis training sequence, Stages 1–1, 1–3 and 1–4, where the\nfood was to the left of the tool, were omitted. For subject 2,\nwe additionally omitted Stage 1–2 left and 2–1 left. The\nanimals took a relatively long time to master these condi-\ntions; therefore, we tried to apply the protocols by which\nthey were trained to retrieve the food item on the left and\nthe right concurrently for subjects k1 and k3. In this modi-\nWed protocol, if the subject met the acquisition criterion\nwhen the food item was placed on the left, we did not\nmove on to the next step but waited until they met the cri-\nterion on the right in the same training step. After the con-\nditions on both sides were mastered, then the subjects\nmoved on to the next training step. The numbers of trials\nwith food on the left or right of the tool was nearly equal\nwithin each session. All of the animals were trained fol-\nlowing the same procedure for Stages 3 and 4. Although\nsome conditions were not present in the early protocol\n(e.g. steps 1, 3 and 4 on the left for Stage 1), the basic spa-\ntial plan for the placement of the food items relative to the\ntool was the same for all animals.\nThroughout the experimental sessions, one experimenter\nin front of the panel presented the food item and the tool on\nthe table in front of the animals. Daily training sessions\nlasted up to 20 min. The number of trials executed in a\ndaily session varied greatly among subjects and among\ntraining days, especially at the beginning of Stage 1. The\nsubjects completed more than  70 trials/day at maximum,\nbut there were some sessions during which they would not\nExp Brain Res (2011) 213:63–71 67\n123\nwork at all. There was no daily trial assignment that the\nsubjects had to complete; the number of trials they engaged\nin was completely dependent on their motivation to partici-\npate in the experiment. After a subject ate the food item, the\nnext trial started. A successful performance was de Wned as\nthe retrieval of the food item by the animals without any\nhelp from the experimenter. A trial in which the animals\nrepeatedly grasped the tool handle to manipulate the tool\nwas also considered successful. The acquisition criterion to\nmove on to the next training step was deWned as 5 consecu-\ntive successful trials. During training, the subjects were not\nforced to use a particular hand/arm for tool use; they freely\nchose which hand/arm to use. If the subject was reluctant to\nwork, especially in the early phases of a new step, we occa-\nsionally reintroduced the pr eceding conditions to motivate\nthem to participate.\nResults\nAll subjects were successfully trained to use the tool and\nWnished the Wnal step of the training protocol (Stage 4–3 in\nFig. 1). The time course of acquisition in each step varied\nconsiderably between subject s and training steps (Fig. 2).\nThe step that required the largest number of trials to\nachieve mastery also varied by subject: Stage 2–2 on the\nleft for subject 1 (3,290 trials), Stage 2–2 on the right for\nsubject 2 (1,108), Stage 3–3 on the left for subject 3\n(2,048), Stage 3–4 on the right for subject k1 (2,967) and\nStage 4–1 on the left for subject k3 (2,112).\nConsiderable individual di Verences were found in the\nnumber of trials required to  reach the acquisition criterion,\nas shown in Fig. 3a.

A two-way ANOVA [Stage (4) £ Position\n(left or right)] revealed a signi Wcant e Vect of the stages\n[F (3, 126) = 9.673, P < 0.001]. A multiple comparison\nanalysis (Fisher’s LSD test) indicated that the speed at\nStage 4 was slower than the other three stages ( P < 0.001).\nThere were no other e Vects of position [F (1, 126) = 0.141,\nP = 0.708) or interactions [F (3, 126) = 2.134, P =0 . 0 9 9 ) .\nThere was no clear handedness preference in our sub-\njects. While subject 1 consistently used unilateral hand\nmovements, the other subjects ( n = 4) used both hands to\nmove the tool depending on the location of the food item.\nThat is, when the food reward was located to the left of\nthe tool, they always used their right hand to manipulate it\nand vice versa. In Stage 4–3, the Wnal training step, all of\nthe subjects except for subject 1 used one hand to displace\nthe tool Wrst and then used the other hand to retrieve the\nfood items (Table 2). Subjects 2, k1 and k3 used the left\nhand Wrst and then the right hand; subject 3 used the oppo-\nsite orientation (see SI video 1, 2 and 3 for videos of the\nperformance by subject 1, 3 and k1). Finally, the subjects\nlearned to retrieve the food wherever the food items were\nplaced on the table (see SI video 4 for the performance by\nsubject 3).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, common marmosets were successfully trained\nto manipulate a rake-shaped tool after numerous trials. This\nis the Wrst time that this has been reported in this species.\nThis Wnding indicates that marmosets have a high learning\nability. A parametric analysis of the velocity of the tool tip\n(Fig. 4) conWrmed the gradual change in their motor con-\ntrol. Successful acquisition of tool use further supports the\npresence of the cognitive and physical ability of these ani-\nmals to use the concept of support from both production\n(tool-use learning) and recognition (discrimination of sup-\nport) perspectives.\nWhen comparing common marmosets to Japanese mon-\nkeys, the following three critical points have to be consid-\nered. First, there is a di Verence in hand structure between\nthe common marmosets and the Japanese macaques. While\nmacaques have nails on all of their Wngers, marmosets have\nclaws (Soligo and Müller 1999). This may considerably\nreduce their dexterity for tool manipulation. Thus, we mod-\niWed the rake-shaped tool that had been used with Japanese\nmacaques, creating a special handle that attached to the\nshaft of the tool, so that the common marmosets did not\nneed to use a precision grip to grasp the handle. Second,\nthere are some diVerent features in the cortical hand enervation\nFig. 4 Velocity (cm/s) of the tool in each step. Data were averaged for the Wve consecutive successful trials, which were de Wned as such by the\nacquisition criterion for a given step.

While humans and macaques have\ncortico-motoneuronal projections, there is no such projec-\ntion in common marmosets (Lemon and Gri Yths 2005).\nAdditionally, the gene expression of secreted phosphopro-\ntein 1 (SPP1), which is thought to correlate with dexterous\nmotor control in primates, is distributed in the thalamus,\nbrainstem and spinal cord of both rhesus macaques and\ncommon marmosets; however, SPP1 distribution in the\nsensorimotor cortex was found in macaques but not mar-\nmosets (Higo et al. 2010). Third, macaques may use their\nhands more often than marmosets. In the wild, marmosets\ndepend on plant exudates and gums heavily (20–70% of\ntheir total intake) for their daily food intake (Ferrari 1993).\nWhen feeding, they pierce the trunks of trees and lick the\nexudates directly (Stevenson and Rylands 1988), without\nusing their hands. In additio n, captive marmosets often eat\nfood pellets without using their hands.\nThese di Verences may in Xuence the speed of learning.\nCompared with the results obtained with a Japanese\nmacaque (Yamazaki et al. 2009), the marmosets required\nmany more trials to achieve the acquisition criterion. Our\nmarmosets required 7,026 trials at minimum (subject k3,\nFig. 3a); one Japanese macaque required only 513 trials to\nachieve the Wnal step of the training protocol (which was\ncomparable to the number of trials in the present study;\nRake I–VII in Yamazaki et al. 2009). In addition, the num-\nber of trials executed in a daily session was very di Verent\nfor the marmosets and the Japanese macaques. While the\nmacaques executed 100–500 trials on average (Yamazaki\net al. 2009), the marmosets only executed around 40 trials\nand sometimes even fewer in a daily session. This di Ver-\nence may partly be responsible for the slow skill acquisition\nin marmosets. We used two di Verent training orders in\nStages 1 and 2. In these stages, subjects 1, 2 and 3 learned\nto master the conditions with the food items on the right\nWrst, whereas subject k1 and k3 learned both sides simulta-\nneously. The diVerence between these two training orders is\nreXected in the percentage of required trials, as shown in\nFig. 3b. In the case of subjects k1 and k3, the required trials\nfor mastering a given stage were similar for both sides,\nalthough there was an individual di Verence between the\ntwo subjects. This was not the case with subjects 1, 2 and 3.\nThe training protocol for subjects k1 and k3 is therefore felt\nto be more eVective than the protocol for subjects 1, 2 and 3\nbecause it likely enhanced th e transfer of performance\nbetween the left and right sides.\nWith the exception of subject 1, all of the marmosets\nmanipulated the tools bimanually. This also di Vered from\nthe macaques’ performance, which showed an individual\nhand preference as the training proceeded (e.g. Yamazaki\net al. 2009). This lack of hand preference was also di Verent\nfrom the results of the studies using prosimians (e.g. Forsy-\nthe and Ward 1988), orangutans (Rogers and Kaplan 1996)\nand chimpanzees (e.g. Hopkins et al. 2005), all of which\nshowed a population bias for a left- or right-handed prefer-\nence during engaging activities, such as grasping food,\ntouching faces and tool use. The marmosets preferred\nadduction to abduction when th ey made an arc to retrieve\nthe food items, resulting in bimanual tool use that depended\non the spatial relationship between the tool and the food.\nHowever, in Stage 4–3 where there were no position biases\nfor the tool and the food item (because the food item and\ntool were placed in a row), the marmosets showed consis-\ntent tendencies in hand use (Table 2\n). Our results are con-\nsistent with previous Wndings on hand use in common\nmarmosets, which con Wrmed the lack of a population bias\neven when the task dema nd was increased and became\ncomplex. However, the incr eased task complexity a Vected\nthe degree of hand preference in each subject (Hook and\nRogers 2008).\nDespite several di Verences listed above, the kinematic\nchange in tool-use learning was similar to that of Japanese\nmacaques. In Ishibashi et al. ( 2000), the trajectory of the\ntool head became circular, and the velocity became more\nstable, without a rapid increase before impacting the food\nitem, as tool-use training proceeded. Our parametric analy-\nsis also indicated that the velocity of the tool tip slowed and\nstabilised in the Wnal stage of the training. In addition, tool\ntip movement became smooth, as shown in the video clips\n(See SI videos 1–4). As with Japanese macaques, it is plau-\nsible that some neurological features, such as extension of\nthe axon (Hihara et al. 2006), expression of brain-derived\nneurotrophic factors (Ishibashi et al. 2002) and volume\nchanges in some brain regions (Quallo et al. 2009), may\ncontribute to the learning a novel behaviour. Thus, the fact\nthat common marmosets learned to use the rake-shaped tool\npaves the way for future enquiries to examine the biological\nmechanisms underlying cognitive abilities for tool use at\nthe molecular and genetic levels, using this primate species.\nAcknowledgments The study was supported by the Centre for\nAdvanced Research on Logic and Sensibility, The Global COE Program,\nat Keio University, Japan, and the Funding Program for World-leading\nInnovative R&D on Science and Technology, at RIKEN, Japan.\nConXict of interest The authors declare that they have no conXict of\ninterest.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Crea-\ntive Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any\nnoncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nprovided the original author(s) and source are credited.\nReferences\nAsano T (1994) Tool using behavior and language in primates.
