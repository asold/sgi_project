  "abstract": "Attempts to verify power losses deduced from simulation by direct measurement are highly respectable. It is the only means to become confident in models that limit simulation accuracy. Unfortunately, in the power electronics area, power measurements are often very difficult. Despite the fact that it is difficult to built, costly, and time consuming, calorimetric apparatus remains the only way to accurately measure the losses of low-loss components such as some capacitors. This paper presents the validation of the power loss model of high-frequency copper losses in transformers using calorimetric measurements.",
