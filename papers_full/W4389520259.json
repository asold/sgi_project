The core recipe of HuatuoGPT is to lever-\nage both distilled data from ChatGPT and real-\nworld data from doctors in the supervised fine-\ntuning stage. This is not only because purely\nusing ChatGPT-distilled data might cause\n‘model collapse’, but also because real-world\ndata from doctors would be complementary to\nChatGPT-distilled data. The responses from\nChatGPT are usually detailed, well-presented,\nfluent, and instruction-followed, but it cannot\nperform like a doctor in many aspects, e.g.\nfor interactive diagnosis. Therefore, the extra\ndoctors’ data could tame a distilled language\nmodel to perform like doctors. To synergize\nthe strengths of both data sources, we introduce\nRLMF (Reinforcement Learning from Mixed\nFeedback) where a reward model is trained to\nalign the language model with the merits that\nboth sources (ChatGPT and doctors) bring. Ex-\nperimental results (in GPT-4 evaluation, human\nevaluation, and medical benchmark datasets)\ndemonstrate that HuatuoGPT achieves state-of-\nthe-art results in performing medical consulta-\ntion among open-source LLMs. It is worth not-\ning that by using additional real-world data and\nRLMF, the distilled language model (i.e., Hu-\natuoGPT) outperforms its teacher model (i.e.,\nChatGPT) in most cases.\n1 Introduction\nMedicine stands as a paramount pillar in human\nexistence, with its effectiveness heavily relying\non the expertise and experience of professionals.\nYet, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nlike ChatGPT heralds a transformative era for such\nexperience-driven domains (Wang et al., 2023a).\nLLMs learn and mimic human language by lever-\naging retrospective data and generating prospective\n∗Corresponding author. †The first three authors con-\ntributed to this work equally.\noutput. Considering the confluence of experience-\ndriven foundations in both LLMs and medicine, we\nbelieve that LLMs hold significant potential to im-\nprove medical consultation and diagnostic support.\nLearning from ChatGPT? Recent stud-\nies (Taori et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Chen\net al., 2023) show distilling from ChatGPT could\nequip a language model with fluent chat capability\nin some common scenarios. However, ChatGPT,\nand even GPT-4, exhibit relatively poorer perfor-\nmance in vertical domains (such as medicine)\ncompared to domain experts. One contributing\nfactor to this phenomenon is that annotators for\nChatGPT did not reach the expert level and lack\nof proficiency in medical knowledge that medical\ndoctors have. Therefore it is problematic to\npurely distill a medical LLM from a poor teacher\n(i.e., ChatGPT), as popular general democratized\nLLMs did (Chiang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023).\nMoreover, purely using ChatGPT-distilled data\nmight cause ‘ model collapse’ (Shumailov et al.,\n2023) and therefore limits the generalization of\nmedical LLMs.\nLearning from Doctors? On the other hand,\nwhen a model only learns from real-world med-\nical diagnosis dialogues (Wei et al., 2018; Xu et al.,\n2019; Xia et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020), it pro-\nduces overly concise responses and lacks the neces-\nsary level of detail due to the time constraints doc-\ntors face during the diagnostic process, leading to a\ncondensed presentation of information. Compared\nto the responses from ChatGPT that are detailed\nand well-presented (e.g., with well-organized para-\ngraphs, tables and bullets), doctors’ responses are\nnot friendly enough in terms of patience, level of\ndetail, and logical organization.\nPhilosophy of HuatuoGPT To overcome the\nabove issues, the core recipe of this work is to\nleverage both real-world data from doctors and\n10859\nChatGPT vs. Doctor\nUser:我肚子痛(I have a stomachache.)\nChatGPT:我很抱歉听到你肚子痛。肚子痛可能有许多不同的原因，包括消化问\n题、感染、肠道问题或其他健康状况。我是一个语言模型，无法给出确切的医\n疗诊断，但我可以给你一些建议来缓解肚子痛的不适。(I’m sorry to hear that you\nhave a stomachache. Stomachaches can have various causes, including digestive issues,\ninfections, gastrointestinal problems, or other health conditions. As a language model, I\ncannot provide a precise medical diagnosis, but I can give you some advice to alleviate\nthe discomfort of a stomachache.)\n以下是一些可能有助于缓解肚子痛的常见方法(Here are some common methods that\nmay help alleviate a stomachache)：\n• 休息(Rest)：给自己一些时间休息，放松身体，避免过度活动。(Give yourself\nsome time to rest, relax your body, and avoid excessive physical activity.)\n• 热敷(Warm compress)：可以尝试在肚子疼痛的区域放置热水袋或热毛巾，这\n有时可以缓解不适。(You can try placing a hot water bottle or warm towel on the\narea of the stomachache. This can sometimes help alleviate discomfort.)\n......\n• 医疗咨询(Medical consultation)：如果肚子痛持续或加重，或伴随其他严重症\n状（如持续呕吐、高烧、血便等），请尽快咨询医生，以获取专业的建议和治\n疗。(If your stomachache persists or worsens, or if it is accompanied by other severe\nsymptoms such as persistent vomiting, high fever, bloody stools, etc., please consult a\ndoctor as soon as possible for professional advice and treatment.)\n记住，以上建议仅供参考，如果你的症状持续存在或加重，最好咨询医生以获取\n专业的诊断和治疗建议。(Please remember that the above suggestions are for reference\nonly. If your symptoms persist or worsen, it is best to consult a doctor for a professional\ndiagnosis and treatment advice.)\nDoctor: 肚子哪个部位痛？是剧烈的还是轻微的？持续多\n久了？(Where is your abdominal pain? Is it severe or mild?\nHow long has it been going on?)\nUser: 下腹部，有点疼，昨晚开始的，有小半天\n了。(Lower abdomen, a bit painful, started last night, been\nabout half a day.)\nDoctor: 是否伴随其他症状如恶心、呕吐或发热等？(Are\nthere any accompanying symptoms such as nausea, vomiting,\nor fever?)\nUser:有点呕吐。(I vomited.)\nDoctor:昨晚吃什么了？(What did you eat last night?)\nUser: 昨晚吃了点小龙虾。会不会是这个导致的？(Eating\nsome crayfish last night, could that be the cause?)\nDoctor:很可能是急性肠胃炎，通常是由于食物中毒引起\n的，而小龙虾中含有细菌和寄生虫，很容易引起肠胃感\n染。(It’s highly possible that you haveacute gastroenteritis,\nwhich is often caused by food poisoning. Crayfish, in particular,\ncan contain bacteria and parasites that easily lead to gastroin-\ntestinal infections.)\nFigure 1: Example of ChatGPT responses (left) and doctor responses (right), where texts are translated from\nChinese to English. Questions raised by doctors are in blue, and medical diagnoses are underlined. Note that\nChatGPT usually does not raise questions in response to patients or provide medical diagnoses like doctors.\ndistilled data from ChatGPT. We name our model\nHuatuoGPT1 mainly designed for Chinese. Techni-\ncally, we propose a two-stage training framework\nthat fully leverages the strengths of ChatGPT and\ndoctors. The complementarity between real-world\nmedical data from doctors and distilled data from\nChatGPT is further discussed in Sec. 2.\nIn the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage, we\nleverage both real-world data from doctors and\ndistilled data from ChatGPT . The distilled data\nfrom ChatGPT is used to tame language models to\nfollow medical instructions and talk fluently. The\nadditional real-world medical data not only inject\nmedical knowledge into language models but also\ntame the language models to perform medical diag-\nnoses like a doctor. Moreover, the two sources of\ndata are aligned with each other by role-enhanced\npromoting and ChatGPT polishing respectively.\nAfter the SFT stage, to further leverage the\nstrengths of ChatGPT and doctors and meanwhile\nmitigate their weaknesses, we propose Reinforce-\nment Learning with Mixed Feedback (RLMF),\ninspired by RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022) and\n1To commemorate the renowned Chinese physician Hua\nTuo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Tuo).\nRLAIF (Bai et al., 2022). It is used to reward gen-\nerated responses that are not only patient-friendly\n(learned from ChatGPT with better presentation\nquality, detailed, instruction-following abilities,\nand fluent chat), but also doctor-like (learned from\ndoctors with professional and interactive diagno-\nsis).\nEvaluation We propose a comprehensive eval-\nuation method that includes both manual and\nautomatic evaluations for medical LLMs, cover-\ning single-turn and multi-turn medical consulta-\ntions. The experimental results show that our Hu-\natuoGPT outperforms existing open-source med-\nical LLMs and ChatGPT in automatic and man-\nual evaluation. More impressively, our model sur-\npasses the performance of GPT-3.5-turbo in terms\nof automatic evaluation and doctors’ evaluation.\nMoreover, HuatuoGPT achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) zero-shot performance in several medi-\ncal benchmarks such as CmedQA (Zhang et al.,\n2018), webmedQA (He et al., 2019), and Hu-\natuo26M (Li et al., 2023a) datasets. We will open-\nsource our training data, code, HuatuoGPT model,\nand the reward model at https://github.com/\nFreedomIntelligence/HuatuoGPT.\n10860\nModel Language Instruction Data Conversation Data Training MethodDistilled Real-world Distilled Real-world\nChatDoctor English ✓ ✓ - - SFT\nMEDALPACA English ✓ ✓ - - SFT\nVisual Med-Alpaca English ✓ - - - SFT\nMedicalGPT-zh Chinese ✓ - - - SFT\nBenTsao Chinese ✓ - - - SFT\nDoctorGLM Chinese ✓ ✓ - ✓ SFT\nHuatuoGPT (Ours) Chinese ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ SFT+RLMF\nTable 1: Comparison of Data Sources and Training Method Across Popular Medical Models.\n2 Motivation\nAs shown in Figure 1, the responses from ChatGPT\nand doctors are different but complementary.\nChatGPT Responses Although ChatGPT usu-\nally generates informative, well-presented and log-\nical responses, ChatGPT does not perform like\ndoctors that conduct interactive diagnosis. For\nexample, when a user provides too little informa-\ntion to make a diagnosis decision, it usually enu-\nmerates multiple possibilities and provides general\nyet unprofessional advice while doctors usually ask\nclarifying questions before giving advice.\nDoctors’ Responses Doctors are adept at inquir-\ning about the symptoms and providing accurate\ndiagnoses. Their responses typically exhibit pro-\nfessionalism that meets the personalized consulta-\ntion. However, due to limited time at inquiry, their\nreplies are often informal and concise in nature,\nand sometimes incoherent. Our preliminary study\nshows that training from purely patient-doctor in-\nteraction data is not satirized: (1) it cannot fluently\nfollow diverse instructions; (2) the responses are\nshort, poorly presented, and sometimes uninforma-\ntive, which are not patient-friendly.\nComplementarity between ChatGPT and Doc-\ntors By distilling from ChatGPT, the model could\ngenerate informative, well-presented, and logical\nresponses. Conversely, real-world data, harvested\nfrom authentic doctor-patient interactions, provide\nan indispensable perspective into the complexities\nof actual medical scenarios. The primary strength\nof real-world data lies in their high accuracy and\nprofessionalism. Therefore, we believe that re-\nsponses from ChatGPT and Doctors could be com-\nplementary; we expect a model to not only chat\nfluently like ChatGPT but also behave like doctors.\n3 Methodology\nFollowing the above motivation, we propose to\ncombine the strengths of both distilled data (from\nChatGPT) and real-world data (from Doctors) to\ntame the medical LLM to perform like a doctor,\nas illustrated in Table 1. For example, it is ex-\npected to not only provide detailed, informative,\nand well-presented content but also conduct ac-\ncurate and interactive diagnostics (usually posing\nclarifying questions) like doctors. To this end,\nour approach focuses on integrating the charac-\nteristics of both doctor and ChatGPT to enhance\nthe quality of responses in medical consultations\nthrough a two-stage training strategy: our approach\nfirst hybrid distilled and real-world data in the su-\npervised fine-tuning stage (SFT) and then employ\nthe Reinforcement Learning from Mixed Feedback\n(RLMF) to further leverage the strengths of both\ndata and meanwhile mitigate their weaknesses. The\nschematic of HuatuoGPT is shown in Figure 2.\n3.1 SFT with Hybrid Data\nIn the first stage, we employ a blend of distilled data\nand real-world data, capitalizing on both strengths\nto endow the model with Doctor-like and Patient-\nfriendly characteristics. Within each data category,\nwe collect instruction data and conversation data to\nimbue the model with the capacity for instruction-\nfollowing and interactive diagnosis. It is notewor-\nthy that all of the real-world data we use is pub-\nlicly available. The single-turn real-world data is\nsourced from Huatuo26M (Li et al., 2023a), and the\nmulti-turn data is sourced from Med-dialog (Zeng\net al., 2020).\nDistilled Data from ChatGPT We collect syn-\nthetic instructions and conversations from Chat-\nGPT using different manners. Following the work\nof self-instruct (Wang et al., 2022; Taori et al.,\n2023; Chen et al., 2023), we construct a set of\n10861\nHuatuoGPT\nSFT ed model\nRLMF\nFeedback\nChatGPT\nSFT\nPatient-friendly\n 😊\nDoctor-like\n \u0000\nInstruction-following\n 🎯\nDoctor\nResponse\nInteractive diagnostic\nHybrid Data\nMedical\nInstructions\nMedical\nConversations\nQuestion\nAnswers\nDiagnostic\nConversations\nReal-world Data (from Doctors)\nDistilled Data (from ChatGPT)\nRole-enhanced\nLLM-polished \n1. 2. \n💡\nFigure 2: Schematic of HuatuoGPT.\nmedical instruction data to enable the model to fol-\nlow the user’s medical instructions. Especially, we\nhave employed a top-down manner to create more\nnatural and comprehensive responses: we design\na taxonomy to collect or manually create seed in-\nstructions based on the roles and use cases, and\ngenerate instructions separately using self-instruct.\nIt provides a wide range of instructions and, mean-\nwhile, keeps enough instructions for each role and\nuse case. More details are shown in App. A.1.\nFor the distilled conversation dataset, we em-\nploy two ChatGPTs, each assigned a specific\nrole—either as a doctor or a patient. Initially, we\nsource real-world data as a foundation for medical\nknowledge, using it to inspire synthetic dialogue.\nThe conversation synthesis involves alternating di-\nalogue utterances generated by the two ChatGPTs.\nThe patient ChatGPT derives its responses from\nbackground patient information, while the doctor\nChatGPT only references the final diagnosis. It’s\nworth noting that the doctor ChatGPT doesn’t have\naccess to the patient’s data, and vice versa. The\ndialogues produced by these large language mod-\nels (LLMs) tend to be informative, detailed, well-\nstructured, and stylistically consistent. Additional\ninformation can be referenced in App. A.2.\nReal-world Data from Doctors Real-world data\nconsists of question-answering and conversations\nbetween doctors and patients from real scenarios,\nwhere doctors’ responses are professional, with\nhigh conciseness and relevance to the patient’s\nquestions. Especially in multi-turn medical con-\nsulting conversations, doctors’ responses often de-\nmand diverse abilities, including long-range rea-\nsoning and raising questions to guide patients in\ndescribing their symptoms. However, raw data is\nunsuitable to be fed directly to LLMs because they\nare usually very colloquial and contain noisy infor-\nmation such as typos, slang, and irrelevant informa-\ntion. To mitigate this, we utilized language models\nto polish the original content. Our goal with this\npolishing process is to make the doctors’ responses\nwell-presented, detailed, and more patient-friendly.\nFor additional specifics, please see App.A.3 and\nApp.A.4.\n3.2 RL with Mixed Feedback\nIn the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase, we\nintroduced a diverse dataset to enable HuatuoGPT\nto emulate the inquiry and diagnosis strategy of\ndoctors while maintaining the rich, logical, coher-\nent characteristics of LLMs’ responses. In order to\nfurther align the model’s generation preferences to\nour needs, we propose reinforcement learning with\nmixed feedback to improve the quality of the mod-\nels’ responses. Previously, OpenAI introduced rein-\nforcement learning with human feedback (Ouyang\net al., 2022) to align LLMs with human preference\nbut at a significant cost of time and labor. Bai\net al. (2022) demonstrated that with a carefully de-\nsigned prompt, AI could imitate human preferences\nand give relatively consistent scores on generated\nresponses. Inspired by these alignment methods,\nwe design a new pipeline by considering different\nsources of feedback to force the model to generate\ninformative and logical responses without deviat-\ning from the doctor’s diagnosis.\n10862\nReward Model We employ a reward model\ntrained on mixed feedback to align with the traits of\nboth doctors and ChatGPT. Our training data com-\nprises authentic instructions and dialogues, from\nwhich we extract multiple responses using our re-\nfined model. In the case of multi-turn interactions,\nthe dialogue history is incorporated to streamline\nour model’s response generation. Subsequently,\nwe prompt ChatGPT to evaluate on different re-\nsponses. The scoring isn’t solely based on fac-\ntors like informativeness, coherence, and alignment\nwith human preferences; it also weighs the fac-\ntual accuracy by comparing them against responses\nfrom real doctors. The paired responses receive\nscores from ChatGPT, which are then incorporated\ninto the reward model. The details for ChatGPT\npreference scoring can be found in App. B. To\naccount for potential positional bias in ChatGPT,\neach evaluation is conducted twice, with data po-\nsitions swapped. Only selections that consistently\nachieve high scores in both positions are taken into\nconsideration.\nReinforcement Learning In the RL process, we\nsample kdifferent input samples {x1,...,x k}and\ngenerate responses {y1,...,y k}by current policy\nπ. Each sample yi is fed to our reward model to\nprovide a reward score rRM . To ensure that the\nmodel does not deviate too far from the initial state\nπ0, we add the empirically-estimated KL penalty\nterm(Schulman et al., 2017), and the final reward\nfunction is as follows:\nr= rRM −λKLDKL(π||π0) (1)\nwhere λKL is a hyperparameter for KL penalty,\nDKL is the KL penalty function. Input queries are\nde-duplicated and sampled from the remaining SFT\nhybrid data. This ensures a diverse range of inputs\nwhile retaining the model’s response preferences\nin both the single-turn instruction and the multi-\nturn conversation scenarios. The training details of\nHuatuoGPT can be seen in App. E.\n4 Experiments\nIn this section, we first introduce the baselines and\nthen present the evaluation protocol and results in-\ncluding pairwise evaluation by GPT-4/Doctors on\nsingle-turn questions and multi-turn conversations.\nConsidering the small scale of pairwise evaluation,\nwe also evaluate our model on the large-scale med-\nical QA benchmark to validate HuatuoGPT.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol\n4.2 Baselines\nWe select the following three groups of models\nas baselines: (1) Two popular general models:\nChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) and GPT-4 2, which\nare the strongest language models in the gen-\neral domain; (2) Two open-source general mod-\nels specialized in Chinese: ChatGLM-6B (Zeng\net al., 2023) and Ziya-LLaMA-13B3; (3) Two most\nrepresentative open-source Chinese medical mod-\nels: BenTsao 4 (Wang et al., 2023b) and Doctor-\nGLM (Xiong et al., 2023).\n4.3 Pairwise Evaluation by GPT-4/Doctors\nWe comprehensively evaluate HuatuoGPT perfor-\nmance by pairwise evaluation with it and other\nbaselines on single-turn questions and multi-turn\nconversations.\nFor the single-turn questions, we extract 100\nquestions representing 10 intents (shown in Ta-\nble 4 in App. G) from the validation set of the\nKnowledge-based Universal Automated Knowl-\nedge Extraction for Query Intent Classification\n(KUAKE-QIC) in Chinese Biomedical Language\nUnderstanding Evaluation (CBLUE (Zhang et al.,\n2021))5. KUAKE-QIC is collected from search\nengine queries, which makes it suitable for single-\nturn questions. To filter noisy data, these questions\nare initially scored by ChatGPT, and a manual fil-\ntering process is conducted to select higher-quality\ncandidate questions for the test set.\nFor the multi-turn conversations, we utilize the\npatient cases from Med-dialog (Zeng et al., 2020),\nselect 20 departments (shown in Table 5 in App. G)\nand randomly sample 5 patient cases from each de-\npartment, resulting a total of 100 real patient cases.\nThese cases are provided to ChatGPT, which plays\nthe role of the patient, interacting with each doctor\nmodel to obtain the diagnosis results. When eval-\nuated by doctors, we randomly sample 50 patient\ncases from 100 test cases.\nIn both single-turn question and multi-turn con-\nversation scenarios, we use GPT-4 and human eval-\nuation as metrics to compare responses generated\nfrom different models.\n2We use the gpt-3.5-turboand gpt-4-0314 API.\n3https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL/\nZiya-LLaMA-13B-v1\n4https://huggingface.co/thinksoso/\nlora-llama-med\n5https://github.com/CBLUEbenchmark/CBLUE\n10863\n(b) Doctor Evaluation(a) GPT -4 Evaluation\nFigure 3: Response Comparison of HuatuoGPT with Other Baselines on the Single-turn Question.\n(b) Doctor Evaluation(a) GPT -4 Evaluation\nFigure 4: Response Comparison of HuatuoGPT with Other Baselines on the Multi-turn Conversations.\nGPT-4 Evaluation We prompt GPT-4 to con-\nsider the following aspects of responses: doctor-\nlike language, symptom inquiry capability, the ef-\nfect and reliability of the treatment recommenda-\ntions and prescriptions, and helpfulness. Given the\nquestion and the two corresponding responses from\ndifferent models, GPT-4 is asked to first compare\nthe advantages of each response and then select the\nbetter response. Recent studies show that GPT-4\nhas a high agreement with human judgment (Zheng\net al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b), but\nthere is no study on the agreement between GPT-4\nand expert doctors. Concerned about the impact\nof the response position (Wang et al., 2023c), we\nrandomly switched the position of two responses.\nDoctor Evaluation We invite three doctors to\ncompare responses from pairwise models accord-\ning to the guidelines: (1) diagnosis accuracy, (2)\ntreatment recommendation accuracy, and (3) med-\nication knowledge and prescription accuracy. In\nevaluation, doctors are asked to provide assess-\nments of different responses generated by two mod-\nels for the same context. We ensure that each re-\nsponse data is scrambled and anonymized with the\nutmost strictness. See App. F for details.\n4.4 Medical QA Benchmarks\nWe select three existing Chinese medical QA\ndatasets, namely cMedQA2 (Zhang et al., 2018),\nwebMedQA (He et al., 2019) and Huatuo-\n26M (Li et al., 2023a). cMedQA2 is a publicly\navailable dataset based on Chinese medical ques-\ntions and answers consisting of 108,000 questions\nand 203,569 answers. webMedQA is a real-world\nChinese medical QA dataset collected from online\nhealth consultancy websites consisting of 63,284\nquestions. Huatuo-26M (Li et al., 2023a) is the\nlargest Chinese medical QA dataset which has 26M\nQA pairs from online medical consultation, knowl-\nedge bases and encyclopedias. Following the pre-\nvious works (Li et al., 2023a), we utilize metrics\nsuch as BLEU, ROUGE, GLEU, and Distinct.\n4.5 Experimental Results\nResults on Single-turn Questions For the evalu-\nation of the single-turn questions, all the model per-\nformance results are shown in Figure 3 and the com-\nparison among models for each category is shown\nin Table 4 in App. G. According to the evaluation\nof GPT-4 and doctors, HuatuoGPT outperforms all\nbaselines except GPT-4. From Table 4, HuatuoGPT\nis much better than BenTsao and DoctorGLM in\nall categories. Compared with Ziya-LLaMA-13B,\n10864\nChatGLM and ChatGPT, HuatuoGPT stands out\nin terms of efficacy, medical expense and indica-\ntors interpretation. However, HuatuoGPT is still\nworse than GPT-4 in many categories, where it\nattains similar performance to GPT-4 in two cat-\negories (Efficacy and Medical Expenses). Such\nresults confirm the validity of our approach, and\nHuatuoGPT can receive more preference compared\nto other models.\nResults on Multi-turn Conversations As shown\nin Figure 4, HuatuoGPT performs exceptionally\nwell against all models in multi-turn conversations,\nwhich reveals that HuatuoGPT excels in extended\ndialogue contexts, evidenced by a 97% win rate\nagainst DoctorGLM and 62% against ChatGPT.\nThis result is made possible by our conversation\ndata, which comprise informative synthetic conver-\nsation data, and real conversation data that contains\nthe diagnostic capability of doctors. From Table 5\nin App. G, it shows that HuatuoGPT outperforms\nother models in almost all departments. This again\nconfirms the effectiveness of our approach: Hu-\natuoGPT has a more prominent interactive diag-\nnostic capability in patient consultation scenarios\nand its performance is preferred by both GPT-4 and\ndoctors.\nResults on Public QA Benchmark HuatuoGPT\ndemonstrates impressive performance across vari-\nous Chinese medical benchmarks, achieves consis-\ntently high scores across all metrics, and demon-\nstrates a high level of accuracy, fluency, and di-\nversity in its generated responses. In cMedQA2,\nHuatuoGPT even outperforms fine-tuned T5, sug-\ngesting that it has a robust generalization capability\nand is able to effectively handle a wide range of\nmedical question-answering tasks.\n4.6 Ablation Study\nIn this section, we delve into an exploration of how\ntwo distinct types of data, real-world and distilled,\nalong with the RLMF process, influence our model.\nTo do so, we trained three distinct models. The first,\nHuatuoGPT (w/ real data), exclusively utilizes\nreal-world data. The second, HuatuoGPT (w/ dis-\ntilled data), solely relies on distilled data. Lastly,\nwe have HuatuoGPT (w/o RLMF), a model that\ndoes not incorporate the RLMF process.\nGPT-4 Evaluation In order to investigate the in-\nfluence of different types of data, we perform au-\ntomated evaluation experiments. Following the\nHuatuoGPT (w/o RLMF) (w/ dist) (w/ real)\nModel\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8Win rate\n0.575\n0.505\n0.47\n0.385\n0.66 0.645\n0.43\n0.64\nSingle-turn Questions\nMulti-turn Conversations\nFigure 5: The win-rate of our ablation models com-\npared with ChatGPT, with ties evenly divided between\nwins and losses. (w/o RLMF) represents HuatuoGPT\nwithout RLMF, while (w/ dist) and (w/ real) denote Hu-\natuoGPT (w/ distilled data) and HuatuoGPT (w/ real\ndata), respectively.\nevaluation methodology used previously, we com-\npare all four models to ChatGPT in both single and\nmulti-turn situations and employ GPT-4 to score\nthe responses of a pair of models. The results of the\nevaluation are shown in Figure 5. The results show\nthat HuatuoGPT (w/ real data) performs better\nin multi-turn conversations while HuatuoGPT (w/\ndistilled data) performs better in single-turn ques-\ntion answering. It confirms that distilled data from\nChatGPT can bring more of a boost to the model\nin single-turn situations, allowing the model to bet-\nter follow instructions and provide more complete\nanswers to a single question. In contrast, real data\nfrom doctors can bring more of a boost to the model\nin multi-turn conversations, allowing the model to\nbetter learn from doctors to perform the interactive\ndiagnosis, obtain patient information and provide\na diagnosis in multi-turn conversations. Compar-\ning HuatuoGPT (w/o RLMF) with HuatuoGPT,\nit can be seen that the RLMF process further im-\nproves the performance of the model in both single-\nturn and multi-turn cases, widens the gap in per-\nformance comparing to ChatGPT. This suggests\nthat the RLMF process can pull the model further\ntoward being both patient-friendly and doctor-like.\nCase Study We compare the variations in re-\nsponses between four models for the same set of\nquestions shown in Table 9 in App.G.HuatuoGPT\n(w/ real data)has a tendency to ask clarifying ques-\ntions to patients, performing as expected, similar to\na doctor. However, a minor flaw is that the question\nis superficial and appears less well-organized for\nreading. On the other hand, HuatuoGPT (w/ dis-\ntilled data) generates well-organized, detailed, and\n10865\nDataset Model BLEU-1 BLEU-2 BLEU-3 BLEU-4 GLEU ROUGE-1 ROUGE-2 ROUGE-L Distinct-1 Distinct-2\nT5 (fine-tuned) 20.88 11.87 7.69 5.09 7.62 27.16 9.30 20.11 0.41 0.52\ncMedQA2\nDoctorGLM 13.51 7.10 3.72 2.00 5.11 22.78 5.68 12.22 0.85 0.96\nChatGPT 19.21 7.43 3.14 1.24 5.06 20.13 3.10 12.57 0.69 0.99\nChatGLM-6B 24.90 12.74 6.99 3.87 8.49 28.52 7.19 18.21 0.68 0.99\nZiya-LLaMA-13B 27.03 13.87 7.48 4.09 7.77 28.24 7.10 14.81 0.78 0.93\nHuatuoGPT 27.39 14.38 8.06 4.55 8.52 29.26 8.02 15.46 0.74 0.93\nT5 (fine-tuned) 21.42 13.79 10.06 7.38 8.94 31.00 13.85 25.78 0.37 0.46\nwebMedQA\nDoctorGLM 9.91 5.20 2.78 1.54 4.67 23.01 5.68 11.96 0.84 0.95\nChatGPT 18.06 6.74 2.73 1.09 4.71 20.01 2.81 12.58 0.65 0.87\nChatGLM-6B 23.42 12.10 6.73 3.83 8.04 28.30 6.87 18.49 0.63 0.87\nZiya-LLaMA-13B 22.16 11.70 6.53 3.74 6.91 27.41 6.80 13.52 0.76 0.93\nHuatuoGPT 24.85 13.42 7.72 4.51 7.50 28.30 7.72 14.50 0.73 0.93\nHuatuo-26M\nT5 (fine-tuned) 26.63 16.74 11.77 8.46 11.38 33.21 13.26 24.85 0.51 0.68\nDoctorGLM 11.50 6.00 3.14 1.69 4.65 22.39 5.47 12.14 0.85 0.96\nChatGPT 18.44 6.95 2.87 1.13 4.87 19.60 2.82 12.46 0.69 0.89\nChatGLM-6B 24.46 12.75 7.20 4.13 8.50 28.44 7.31 18.58 0.67 0.89\nZiya-LLaMA-13B 25.58 13.39 7.46 4.24 7.30 28.14 7.18 14.78 0.77 0.93\nHuatuoGPT 27.42 14.84 8.54 4.96 8.01 29.16 8.29 15.84 0.74 0.93\nTable 2: Benchmark on Chinese medical QA dataset (Li et al., 2023a).

Nevertheless, its responses\ntend to provide suggestions rather than making a\ndiagnostic decision. To assess the impact of RLMF,\nwe also compare HuatuoGPT and HuatuoGPT\n(w/o RLMF). It is worth noting that HuatuoGPT\n(w/o RLMF) does not ask additional questions to\npatients. This might be attributed to the fact that\nits training data could be biased towards the Chat-\nGPT data, while real-world data may have been\noverlooked. In contrast, our default model, Hu-\natuoGPT, can function like a doctor by asking\nfollow-up questions to patients to get more accu-\nrate diagnoses.\n5 Related Work\nThe medical language model has always been a con-\ncern for researchers. The early models were mainly\nbased on the GPT-2 series models to continue pre-\ntraining in the domain, such as BioMedLM 6 and\nBioGPT (Luo et al., 2022). Recently, the success of\ndistilled from ChatGPT (Taori et al., 2023; Chiang\net al., 2023) has stimulated some efforts to fine-tune\nlarge-scale language models using medical-related\ninstruction data.\nChatDoctor (Li et al., 2023c) is a medi-\ncal model based on LLaMA (Touvron et al.,\n2023) trained on the real-world instruction data\n(HealthCareMagic-100k and icliniq-10k) between\npatient and physician and the distilled instruction\n6https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/\nintroducing-pubmed-gpt\ndata from ChatGPT (GenMedGPT-5k and disease\ndatabase). Based on the dataset of ChatDoctor,\nMEDALPACA(Han et al., 2023) added more data\npoints across a diverse range of tasks, including\nopenly curated medical data transformed into Q/A\npairs with ChatGPT and a collection of established\nNLP tasks in the medical domain. Different from\nthe previous work, Visual Med-Alpaca7 is only\ntrained on the distilled instruction dataset while the\n54K samples are filtered and edited by human ex-\nperts. Recently, Med-PaLM2 (Singhal et al., 2023)\nwas published, which is based on PaLM2 and fine-\ntuned in MultiMedQA for expert-Level medical\nquestion answering.\nIn Chinese, BenTsao (Wang et al., 2023b) is\na knowledge-enhanced Chinese Medical LLM\ntrained on over 8K instructions generated from\nCMeKG by ChatGPT without real-world data.\nMedicalGPT-zh (Liu et al., 2023) is a Chinese\nmedical model based on ChatGLM-6B LoRA\nwith 16-bit instruction fine-tuning. The training\ndataset was obtained from Chinese medical knowl-\nedge question-and-answer pairs and clinical guide-\nline texts from 28 medical departments. Doctor-\nGLM (Xiong et al., 2023) is a Chinese medical\nChatGLM-based LLM trained on multiple medical\ndatasets. In addition to the distilled instruction data\nfrom ChatDoctor through translation, they incorpo-\nrate some Chinese medical conversation data into\nthe training dataset. See App. H for more details\n7https://github.com/cambridgeltl/\nvisual-med-alpaca\n10866\non medical LLMs.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper presents HuatuoGPT, a medical large\nlanguage model, which leverages hybrid data and\nincorporates reinforcement learning from mixed\nfeedback with ChatGPT and doctors. Gathered\nmerits distilled data from ChatGPT and real-world\ndata from doctors, HuatuoGPT is able to gener-\nate patient-friendly and doctor-like responses. By\nrefining its responses based on mixed feedback,\nthe model can improve its conversational abilities\nwhile maintaining the reliability necessary for med-\nical applications. The experimental results of au-\ntomatic and manual evaluations indicate that our\nmodel surpasses the existing medical open-source\nLLMs and even outperforms ChatGPT in most\ncases. As we continue to explore and develop this\napproach, we believe that further research in this\narea holds significant potential for advancing the\nfield of AI in medicine.\nLimitations\nKnowledge-intensive Benchmarking Recent\nstudies tend to evaluate large language models us-\ning knowledge-intensive tasks e.g. multiple-choice\nquestions (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Huang et al.,\n2023). We argue that such benchmarking perfor-\nmance highly depends on the foundation models,\nwhich is unaffordable for us in terms of computing\nresources. Therefore, we leave it for future work.\nHuatuoGPT for more Languages Our models\nare specific to Chinese, where healthcare inequality\nin China is a significant issue. We wish it could\nleverage high-quality medical resources in first-tier\ncities and then distribute it via online HuatuoGPT\nto rural areas. We will release new versions in\nother languages following the same philosophy of\nHuatuoGPT.\nEthic Statement\nData Collection In our study, we relied solely\non publicly accessible datasets and did not utilize\nany in-hospital data. Details can be found in the\nMethodology section. To address potential privacy\nconcerns, we meticulously reviewed the dataset\nto ensure the absence of any private or sensitive\ninformation. Our commitment to data privacy and\nsafety is unwavering. We greatly value the ethical\nhandling of information and are grateful for the\nscholarly community’s diligence in upholding these\nstringent standards.\nCompensation and Ethical Collaboration with\nMedical Professionals We collaborated with\nthree esteemed doctors, including a chief physi-\ncian, whose expertise and insights were invaluable\nto our work. Each of these doctors was compen-\nsated at a rate of 200 RMB per hour for evaluations,\nculminating in a total of 800 RMB. This compen-\nsation rate aligns with the prevailing local salary\nstandards and has been determined to ensure that\ntheir specialized knowledge and time are fairly re-\nmunerated.\nConcerning Accurateness of Medical Advice\nWe emphasize the potential risks associated with\ngeneration-based medical consultation. The main\nconcern lies in the challenge of verifying the accu-\nracy and correctness of the generated content. In\nthe medical domain, the dissemination of mislead-\ning information can have severe ethical implica-\ntions. Although generative QA has shown promise,\nespecially with the success of models like Chat-\nGPT, they are not yet prepared for real-world\ndeployment in the biomedical domain.\nWhile generation methods currently hold great\npotential, it is important to exercise caution and\nprudence before deploying them in real-world ap-\nplications. Further research and development are\nnecessary to refine these models, enhance their\naccuracy, and establish robust mechanisms for\naccurateness-checking and error correction. Only\nthrough scrutiny and continual improvement can\nwe minimize the risks and ethical concerns associ-\nated with generation-based medical QA.\nAutonomy We respect the principle of auton-\nomy for AI. The decisions made by our LLMs are\nnot intended to replace doctor decision-making pro-\ncesses but rather to augment doctor capabilities and\noffer additional insights.\nTo demonstrate that the effectiveness of our pro-\nposed method is independent of the scale of the\nbackbone, we also used Bloom-7B1-mt as the back-\nbone for the internal evaluation for comparison, as\nshown in Table 10 in App. J. We acknowledge its\nlicense and won’t release the Bloom-based model.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported by Chinese Key-\nArea Research and Development Program of\nGuangdong Province (2020B0101350001), the\n10867\nShenzhen Science and Technology Program\n(JCYJ20220818103001002), the Guangdong\nProvincial Key Laboratory of Big Data Com-\nputing, The Chinese University of Hong Kong,\nShenzhen, Shenzhen Key Research Project\n(C10120230151) and Shenzhen Doctoral Startup\nFunding (RCBS20221008093330065).\nReferences\nYuntao Bai, Saurav Kadavath, Sandipan Kundu,\nAmanda Askell, Jackson Kernion, Andy Jones,\nAnna Chen, Anna Goldie, Azalia Mirhoseini,\nCameron McKinnon, et al. 2022.

The prompt is shown below:\n你被要求设计20个不同的<角色，指令，输\n入>三元组，第一行是角色，第二行是该角\n色希望GPT帮助他提升生活工作效率的指令，\n第三行是该指令对应的输入。\n要求：\n1.角色可以很具体，需要跟医疗场景有关，如\n果是医生的话，甚至可以细化到医疗科室，例\n如“呼吸内科医生”。\n2.每个指令的描述应该是多样化的，指令的类\n型应该是多样化，动词尽量不要重复，以最\n大限度地提高多样性。每个指令应该是GPT语\n言模型能够完成的事情，不能生成绘制图片，\n不能阅读音频和网页链接; 指令应该是1到2句\n话的长度，既可以是命令句，也可以是疑问\n句;指令通常有一个占位符，placeholder，\n例如“下面这个”或者“某个”，“输入”字段会指\n定。\n3.输入应该为指令的具体例子，提供真实的\n实质性内容，因为指令可能很空洞，需要用\n一个具体的输入来限定，输入不能是只有一\n个链接或者文件名,或者没有特指的“一篇论\n文”，而应该是具体的内容。输入最好不要超\n过200字。\n4.角色、指令和输入大多是中文的，角色、指\n令和输入都不要重复。指令是必须需要，请尽\n量提供角色和输入。 输入可以为空\n20个三元组的清单如下：\nTranslation:\nYou are asked to design 20 different triplets\nof<characters, instructions, input>. The first line\nis the character, the second line is the instruction\nthat the character wants GPT to help him improve\nhis work efficiency, and the third line is the corre-\nsponding input for the instruction. requirement:\n1.

We initial-\nize the model parameters using Ziya-LLaMA-13B-\nPretrain. It was a LLaMA-13B model continue pre-\ntrained on a massive Chinese corpus, which enables\nit better follow Chinese instruction and store more\n8https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index\n9https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx\n10872\nChinese knowledge. We leverage ZeRO (Rajbhan-\ndari et al., 2020) strategy to distribute the model\nacross 8 A100 GPUs for training. In the supervised\nfine-tuning process, we set the learning rate, batch\nsize, and maximum context length to 5e−5, 128,\nand 2048, respectively. All models are trained for\n3 epochs and weights performed the best on the\nvalidation set are saved. During the reinforcement\nlearning process, we only update the parameters of\nthe last two layers. The entire process encompasses\n16,000 steps, undertaken at a learning rate of1e−6.\nWe establish a rollout size of 64, chunk size of 8,\nand 4 PPO epochs. The initial kl divergence co-\nefficient is set at 0.1. In addition, to enhance the\nmodel’s conversational and instruction-following\ncapabilities in the general domain, we have incorpo-\nrated Chinese instruction data (the Chinese Alpaca\ndataset (Peng et al., 2023) and conversation data\n(ShareGPT10). This enhances the model’s ability\nto effectively understand and generate responses\nin various conversational scenarios and accurately\nfollow instructions across different domains.\nF Evaluation Guidelines for doctors\nIn the manual evaluation of the HuatuoGPT, we\nthink that the following three aspects should be\nconsidered, particularly in medical consultation\nand medication prescription, and take them as the\nguidelines for evaluation:\nDiagnosis accuracy. This aspect evaluates the\nmodel’s accuracy and comprehensiveness in diag-\nnosing patient symptoms. Evaluators are provided\na set of medical cases or symptom descriptions\nand assess the correctness, relevance, and reason-\nableness of the model’s diagnosis. Comparisons\ncan be made with assessments made by medical\nprofessionals to ensure the model’s accuracy.\nTreatment recommendation accuracy. This\naspect assesses the accuracy and appropriateness\nof the model’s treatment recommendations for pa-\ntients. Evaluators are provided a set of medi-\ncal cases or symptom descriptions and evaluate\nwhether the model’s treatment recommendations\nalign with medical knowledge and real-world ap-\nplications that are effective and reliable for the\npatient’s main condition and problem.\nMedication knowledge and prescription accu-\nracy. This aspect evaluates the model’s understand-\ning of medications and the accuracy of its prescrip-\n10https://huggingface.co/datasets/philschmid/\nsharegpt-raw\ntion recommendations. Evaluators are provided a\nset of medical cases or symptom descriptions and\nassess the accuracy and reliability of the medication\nrecommendations based on medical knowledge and\nguidelines.\nG Details of Evaluation\nWe present detailed evaluation scores correspond-\ning to each category in Table 4 and Table 5. Sam-\nple responses from four models for ablation study\nare shown in Table 9.\nH Details of Popular Medical Language\nModels\nThe details of popular medical language models\nare shown in Table 6.\nI Cases\nI.1 Single-turn Question Cases\nSingle-turn question cases are shown in Table 7.\nI.2 Multi-turn Question Cases\nMulti-turn conversation cases are shown in Table 8.\nI.3 Ablation cases\nAblation cases are shown in Table 9.\nJ Evaluation on Other Backbones\nUsing the same method and data described in this\npaper, we have also conducted a simple study\non Bloom-7B1-mt and compared the performance\nwith ChatGPT on human evaluation, which is\nshown in Table 10. This shows that even with a\nmuch-smaller backbone model, HuatuoGPT could\nalso achieve competitive performance with Chat-\nGPT.

The doctor said it was due to dry skin, and prescribed Er Fu Kang lotion. After using it, the\ncondition improved. However, recently the child started scratching again. We initially thought it was still due to dryness\nand continued to apply Er Fu Kang lotion, but it didn’t help. Later, we found something similar to goosebumps on the\nchild’s skin, which wasn’t red but itchy. Whenever he took off his clothes, he started scratching severely, often causing\nbleeding. This happened on his arms, back, waist, buttocks, legs, and the back of his neck. After scratching, a thick layer\nwould form, similar to ringworm. The doctor at the hospital said it was an allergy and prescribed Fu Le skincare cream\nfrom Peking Union Medical College Hospital (we started applying it yesterday afternoon) and Desloratadine syrup. But\ntoday it seems to have worsened, with patches of red appearing on his legs. When he was young, he ate shrimp, but\nafter his skin condition worsened, we stopped it for a while. When we tried again, he developed bumps all over his body,\nso we dared not feed him shrimp anymore. After eating eggs, bumps would appear around his mouth but they would\ndisappear after a while. He usually eats very little, but four days ago when we visited a friend’s house, he grabbed a raw\negg, and frighteningly, his mouth was filled with bumps, and wherever his hand touched, bumps would form. However,\nthey disappeared after he woke up from sleep.\nHelp needed: Is this an allergy? Do we need to use other medicines?\nDuration of illness: Within a month\nSummary of the condition: Urticaria, Eczema\nAdvice: Take Desloratadine syrup orally as per the instructions.

Based on the information you have provided, you may be\nexperiencing an allergic reaction. However, in order to determine your situation more precisely, I need to know more\nabout your symptoms and physical condition.\n1. Have you been exposed to substances such as new cosmetics or skin care products?\n2. Have you taken any new medications or eaten certain specific foods?\n3. Where is your skin area? Does it occur with other symptoms such as itching, redness, swelling, pain, etc.?\n4. What is the treatment you are currently using? What is the effect?\nIn response to the above questions, please describe your situation in as much detail as possible, so that I can make a more\naccurate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment recommendations.)\n病人：1. 我没有接触任何新的化妆品或护肤品等物质。\n2. 没有食用任何新的食物，也没有服用任何新的药物。\n3. 皮肤部位主要在手臂，后背，腰部，屁股，腿和后颈，出现像鸡皮疙瘩一样的小疙瘩，会引发瘙痒，抓后会\n出现类似癣的厚厚的一层疙瘩，最近腿部开始成片成片地发红。除此之外，我没有其他明显的身体不适症状。\n4. 目前使用的治疗方法是北京协和的肤乐护理霜和地氯雷他定糖浆，效果似乎并不是很好。\n(Patient: 1. I have not been exposed to any new substances such as cosmetics or skin care products.\n2. I have not consumed any new foods or taken any new medications.\n3. Skin areas mainly on my arms, back, waist, buttocks, legs and the back of my neck, appearing as small bumps like\ngoose bumps that trigger itching and a thick layer of bumps similar to ringworm when scratched, and recently my legs\nhave started to glow red in patches. Other than that, I have no other significant physical symptoms.\n4. The treatments currently used are Skin Care Cream and Desloratadine Syrup from Peking Union Medical College,\nwhich do not seem to be very effective.)\nHuatuoGPT：非常感谢您提供的详细信息。结合您的症状，初步考虑您可能患有荨麻疹（urticaria），也称为\n风团性皮炎 (hives)，它属于一种过敏性疾病。由于荨麻疹的表现多种多样，而且症状通常会反复出现，所以需\n要根据具体情况来制定相应的治疗方案。\n基于您目前已经尝试了肤乐护理霜和地氯雷他定糖浆，但没有得到良好的缓解效果，因此我建议您到就近的医\n院皮肤科门诊就诊，让专业医生检查您的症状，并根据实际情况进行个体化的治疗。同时，避免暴晒阳光，穿\n宽松透气的衣服，保持室内环境清洁卫生，避免接触可能引起过敏的物质。希望您早日康复！\n(HuatuoGPT: Thank you very much for the detailed information. With your symptoms, it is initially considered that\nyou may be suffering from urticaria, also known as hives, which is an allergic disease. Since urticaria has a variety of\nmanifestations and the symptoms are usually recurrent, a treatment plan will need to be developed on a case-by-case basis.\nBased on the fact that you have tried Skin Care Cream and Desloratadine Syrup without getting good relief, I recommend\nthat you visit the dermatology clinic of your nearest hospital to have your symptoms examined by a professional doctor\nand individualize your treatment according to the actual situation. At the same time, avoid exposure to sunlight, wear\nloose and breathable clothes, keep your indoor environment clean and hygienic, and avoid contact with substances that\nmay cause allergies. Hope you will recover soon!)\n病人：好的，非常感谢您的建议，我会尽快前往皮肤科就诊，遵照医生指导进行治疗，并注意日常预防，谢谢\n您的帮助。再见！\n(Patient: Yes, thank you very much for your advice, I will visit the dermatologist as soon as possible, follow the doctor’s\ninstructions for treatment and pay attention to daily prevention, thank you for your help.
