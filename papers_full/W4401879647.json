The healthcare cyber-\nphysical systems (HCPS) combine physical and cyber components\nto improve the healthcare industry. While HCPS has many\nadvantages, it also has some drawbacks, such as a lengthy data\nentry process, a lack of real-time processing, and limited real-\ntime patient visualization. To overcome these issues, this paper\nrepresents an innovative approach to integrating large language\nmodel (LLM) to enhance the efficiency of the healthcare system.\nBy incorporating LLM at various layers, HCPS can leverage\nadvanced AI capabilities to improve patient outcomes, advance\ndata processing, and enhance decision-making.\nIndex Terms —Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Healthcare\nCyber-Physical systems (HCPS), Large Language Model (LLM)\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nHealthcare cyber-physical systems (HCPS) embody the\nconvergence of cybernetics, software, and physical compo-\nnents, offering profound advancements in medical care [1].\nThese systems, which are critical facilitators of automated\nhealthcare procedures and data-driven medical decisions, are\nfoundational to modern healthcare infrastructures. However,\nHCPS faces significant challenges, such as data fragmentation,\nthe complexity of data interpretation, maintaining effective\npatient communication, manual data processing inefficiencies,\nand privacy concerns, which compromise system performance\nand patient outcomes. These issues highlight the critical need\nfor innovative solutions that can seamlessly integrate and\nsynthesize disparate data sources, enhance data security, and\nautomate complex processes. Large Language Model (LLM)\nhas the potential to transform HCPS by offering cutting-edge\nAI technologies. These cutting-edge LLM models, like the\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models from Ope-\nnAI, can read, understand, and produce human-like content\nat remarkable lengths [2]. A vast family of LLM models,\nincluding the popular GPT model, is revolutionizing Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP). LLM uses a large training cor-\npora of natural language, structured data, and code that are\ncapable of processing database tuples and schemas, and plots.\nThus, the wide-ranging effects of data on LLM can adapt to\nnew industry standards and best practices. By incorporating\nLLM within different layers in HCPS frameworks, we can\nsignificantly streamline data collection, improve the accuracy\nof medical data entry, and facilitate more intuitive patient-\nprovider interactions through natural language interfaces. This\npaper proposes the integration of LLM into the HCPS frame-\nFig. 1. The three-layered architecture of the HCPS, where the data collection\nlayer, data management layer, and application service layer are connected to\nthe Large Language Model (LLM).\nwork to tackle existing shortcomings and optimize healthcare\ndelivery. Our objective is to examine how LLM can enhance\ndecision-making processes, boost system efficiency, and ulti-\nmately lead to superior patient outcomes.\nII. S YSTEM ARCHITECTURE\nThis study investigates the integration of LLMs into HCPS\nby structuring HCPS into three disctince layers: the data col-\nlection layer, the data management layer, and the application\nservice layer [1], as depicted in the Figure 1.\n1) Data Collection Layer: The data collection layer plays a\ncrucial role in acquiring multi-source, heterogeneous medical\ndata from various resources in HCPS. An essential part of this\nlayer is the data node. In traditional HCPS frameworks, data\nnodes gather information from a variety of sources, including\nhospitals, public health agencies, and research institutions [1].\nLLM can include data on individual activities, clinical data,\nand medical history. For instance, patients can communicate\nwith LLM through a natural language interface, entering their\nmedical history, symptoms, and other relevant information\nconversationally. Therefore, the data entry process can be\nautomated by generating electronic health records (EHRs)\nor other databases at the data collection layer. This reduces\nthe possibility of human error and saves time for healthcare\npractitioners by eliminating the need for manual data entry. In\naddition, by integrating LLM into the data collection layer, pa-\ntients’ health status can be monitored in real-time by querying\narXiv:2407.18407v1  [cs.LG]  25 Jul 2024\npatients’ symptoms, medication adherence, and other relevant\ninformation. It helps healthcare professionals identify changes\nor patterns in their patients health and take preventive measures\nthrough this continuous monitoring. In this layer, data privacy\nis imperative and for that, we need a reliable platform for\ndeveloping custom LLMs. There are two options: develop a\ncustom LLM or use third-party companies. Notable companies\nsuch as OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, etc. have trained their\nLLM chatbots to collect usage data, which poses a significant\nrisk when handling sensitive information. Sharing sensitive\ndata to third parties is dangerous, and developing LLM through\nthird-party companies also has disadvantages because these\norganizations constantly invent and may change, deprecate, or\nmodify their products without prior notice. Though custom\nLLM also has development and maintenance costs, using\ncustom LLM takes less risk considering the security and\nprivacy of medical data than using third-party LLM.\n2) Data Management Layer : In the data management\nlayer, LLM can improve the handling and analysis of medical\ndata efficiently. In contrast to conventional data management,\nLLM depicts text material encoded as high-dimensional vec-\ntors of floating-point values, where each dimension corre-\nsponds to a distinct semantic aspect of the text. Rather than\nlooking for particular symbols, query evaluation in LLM in-\nvolves algebraic operations on numerical data representations.\nAdditionally, we can use LLM as a tool for information\nretrieval. By posting inquiries as natural language prompts,\ndata is retrieved as response [3]. For further analysis, we\ncan divide the data management layer into two modules: dis-\ntributed file storage (DFS) and distributed parallel computing\n(DPC) modules. The Distributed File Storage (DFS) mecha-\nnism is essential for large amounts of data in the healthcare\nsystem because it provides efficient storage, high-efficiency\ndata upload, and versatile user management. Furthermore,\nthe distributed parallel computing (DPC) module provides\noffline calculation of massive volumes of data [4]. These\ntwo modules help LLM excel in enhancing data storage and\nreal-time data processing capacity [5]. When an LLM-based\nchatbot in healthcare deals with patient data, the doctor can\nquery information about a patient’s family medical history and\nmedication history in natural language, and the chatbot can\ngenerate an SQL command to query the entire database.\n3) Application Service Layer: The traditional application\nservice layer of HCPS includes statistical and data mining\ntechniques to visualize patient data. We aim to incorporate\nLLM into this layer so that the user can see the results\nof the visual data analysis by displaying patient data us-\ning statistical or predictive methods through queries. For\ninstance, a physician can ask a chatbot with an LLM to\nuse graphs creation, which helps make decisions based on\na patient record. Furthermore, this layer can improve patient\nengagement and data accuracy through medication reminders,\ninformation about the patient’s current medications like side\neffects, dosage, etc., and notifying them if there are any\nmedication conflicts. Additionally, it is helpful to have services\nlike chatbots for appointment scheduling to establish new\nappointments as well as edit existing ones. We can also\nuse the LLM to resolve scheduling conflicts as needed. In\nthis layer, we introduce the patient portal integrating LLM\nthat allows patients and healthcare providers to access their\nmedical information. Finally, this layer’s integration of LLM\nwill provide a real-time interface for patients and healthcare\nprofessionals to make decisions.\nIII. R EALIZATION CHALLENGES\nThe realization of an LLM-integrated HCPS architecture\npresents several challenges that must be meticulously ad-\ndressed to ensure the successful deployment and operation\nof such systems. Technical challenges include ensuring com-\npatibility with existing systems, managing scalability, and\nachieving interoperability across diverse healthcare systems\nand applications. Privacy and security are paramount, with\na need for robust data protection measures, compliance with\nstringent healthcare regulations, and effective anonymization\ntechniques to safeguard patient privacy. Ethical considerations\nsuch as preventing bias in AI algorithms, maintaining trans-\nparency in AI decision-making, and preserving the integrity\nof the patient-provider relationship are critical. Additionally,\nthe sustainability of deploying such advanced technologies in-\nvolves assessing the environmental impact of the massive data\ncenters required to train and run LLMs, promoting energy-\nefficient computing practices, and considering the lifecycle\nmanagement of these systems [6]. Furthermore, economic and\noperational challenges, such as cost justification, professional\ntraining, and continuous system updates, are critical for the\neffective integration of LLM in HCPS.\nIV. C ONCLUSION\nThis paper introduces a novel framework for healthcare\nsystems that incorporates LLM. Although LLM can have some\npotential misuse, the overall performance of medical applica-\ntions increases when LLMs are integrated into data collection,\ndata management, and application service layers. Addressing\nchallenges like security, privacy, cost, and integration, the\nLLM can revolutionize the current HCPS.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y . Zhang, M. Qiu, C.-W. Tsai, M. M. Hassan, and A.
