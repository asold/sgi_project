  "abstract": "The processing of aluminum alloys in optimal conditions is a problem that has not yet been fully resolved. The research carried out so far has proposed various intelligent tools, but which cannot be used in the presence of cooling-lubricating fluids. The objective of the research carried out in the paper was to design intelligent tools that would allow a control of the vibrations of the tool tip and to determine a better roughness of the processed surfaces. The designed intelligent tools can be used successfully in the processing of aluminum alloys, not being sensitive to coolants-lubricants. In the research, the processing by longitudinal turning of a semi-finished product with a diameter Ø = 55 mm of aluminum alloy A2024-T3510 was considered. Two constructive variants of smart tools were designed, realized, and used, and the obtained results were compared with those registered for the tools in the classic constructive variant. The analysis of vibrations that occur during the cutting process was performed using the following methods: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT); Short-Time Fourier-Transformation (STFT); the analysis of signal of vibrations. A vibration analysis was also performed by modeling using the Finite Element Method (FEM). In the last part of the research, an analysis of the roughness of the processed surfaces, was carried out and a series of diagrams were drawn regarding curved profiles; filtered profiles; Abbott–Firestone curve. Research has shown that the use of smart tools in the proposed construction variants is a solution that can be used in very good conditions for processing aluminum alloys, in the presence of cooling-lubrication fluids.",
