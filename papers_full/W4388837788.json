Agricultural safety, Artificial intelligence, Bias, ChatGPT, Consultation, Ex-\ntension, Generative AI, Health, Education, Intellectual Property, Large language models, \nLLM, Teaching. \nhe age of smart digital technology is upon us, and some authors have suggested we \nhave entered the fourth industrial age, sometimes cited as “Industry 4.0” (Liu et al., \n2020). This includes the development and widespread deployment of a range of \ntools that include artificial intelligence, machine learning, and a host of closely intercon-\nnected methods such as deep learning. Ther e are obviously significant implications and \napplications for agriculture and food production, including within the profession of agri-\ncultural safety and health. \nOne significant AI form—Large Language Models (or LLMs) have seemingly burst \nonto the scene over the past year. While these AI-based tools are not new, the release and \nwidespread publicity surrounding the release of the various versions of “ChatGPT” by the \ncompany OpenAI is a new phenomenon that has pushed the idea of generative artificial \nintelligence quickly and aggressively into the mainstream. \nGenerative AI, a category of artificial intelligence that includes LLMs, is already find-\ning its way deeply into research (Stokel-Walker and Van Noorden, 2023). These models \ncan serve as a support tool in a range of business areas (George et al., 2023) like healthcare \n(Xue et al., 2023), education (Cooper, 2023), and service or travel industries (Dogru et al., \n2023). Descriptions of AI in today’s media conversations reflect both hopeful anticipation \nas well as anxiety (Anderson and Rainie, 2023) that it will change our economy, commu-\nnities, and lives. Those of us in higher education will see shifts in how we do our research \n  \n  \nSubmitted for review on 2 October 2023 as manuscript number JASH 15841; approved for publication as an\nInvited Editorial by Community Editor Dr. Michael Pa te of the Ergonomics, Safety, & Health Community o f\nASABE on 3 October 2023. \nT \n \n206  Journal of Agricultural Safety and Health \n(Peres et al., 2023), teaching (Smolansky et  al., 2023), and outr each/Extension activities \n(Ray, 2023a) as we apply AI-based tools to pressing societal challenges and research ques-\ntions. This technology will also continue to impact how we work. \nSince the arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT 3.0 (OpenAI, 2023a), followed soon after by \nthe paid “Plus” version of ChatGPT 4.0 (OpenAI, 2023b), I have spent considerable time \nexploring, thinking about, and deploying this tool in my workflow as an Agricultural Safety \nand Health specialist and professor in our bi ological systems engineering department at \nUW-Madison. I have used LLMs and generative AI image generation such as Midjourney \n(Midjourney, 2023) in several facets of my extension, research, and classroom teaching. In \nthis article, I suggest and demonstrate five specific use cases that I believe will have a place \nsoon for practitioners in agricultural safety and health. I will also discuss three issues, bar-\nriers, and hurdles that we will need to over come as generative AI becomes more heavily \nused in our field as well as other sectors of health, agriculture, and connected industries. \nNote that every week, the landscape around generative AI changes with new models, use \ncases, and an ever-evolving legal landscape. I have attempted in this editorial to capture \nnot only current use cases but also the nature of the evolving issues and concerns that will \nbe with us for several years to come. \nUse Case 1: Responding to Technical Questions \nThe most obvious use case for a well-traine d LLM is to answer technical questions \ncommon for people who work in agricultural safety and health. This can include extension \nexperts, clinicians, educators, engineers, researchers, and other experts who get queried by \nindividual producers, the media, healthcare providers, or agricultural professionals. The \nAppendix shows the responses from ChatGPT 4.0 to several common questions I get sev-\neral times a year, depending on the season, conditions, and other factors. The specific ques-\ntions shown are: \n• What are the main hazards associated with working around stored manure on a typi-\ncal livestock or dairy farm? \n• What safety-related advice should I provide to a retired man and woman who recently \npurchased a hobby farm and plan to purchase a tractor? \n• A farm parent asks at an event if you think it is safe for their 11-year-old child to \ndrive a tractor. How would you answer? \n• What questions and concerns should the transplant team at the local research hospital \naddress or at least consider with farmers who undergo lung transplants and plan to \nreturn to the farm, given that there is little literature available on the topic? (note, this \nwas a unique and one-time question from 2023) \nSince I have over three decades of research  and Extension experience in each of these \ngeneral areas, a quick review of each of the LLM generated responses seems concise, rea-\nsonably accurate, and serves at least to be an  adequate starting point to guide further ex-\nploration. In the case of the lung transplant inquiry, I had found very little in the academic \nliterature, but I had brainstormed with the gr oup who inquired, and later found that the \nLLM response to be helpful and suggested some avenues for questions I had not previously \nfully considered. \nThe “prompts” (Ekin, 2023) used to respond to technical questions of an LLM are im-\nportant, and I have found it helpful to provide as much context as possible, in some cases \nexplaining the “role” that you want ChatGPT 4.0 to play as it formulates its response. I have \n \n29(4): 205-224  207 \nalso found it helpful to ask the AI, “What te n questions are among the most important in \nhelping answer a question such as __________?” This ensures more thorough considera-\ntion, often suggesting new avenues for conversation, which often leads to my clientele \narriving at an acceptable solution simply by helping them to think critically about problems \nor situations. As an example, here is an al ternative way to ask one of the aforementioned \nquestions: \n• I am a farm safety and health specialist at a Midwest university. After a presentation \non farm safety, a dairy farm couple approached me asking if I think it is safe for their \n11-year-old child to drive a tractor during routine work on their family farm. What \nare ten questions I should as k that will help us arrive at an acceptable and accurate \nanswer? The questions should be based on evidence or research-based information. \n(the response is provided in the Appendix) \nAgain, from the responses in the answer pr ovided by the LLM, these would generally \nbe the types of questions I would use to lead parents of a child through this process of \nthinking, considering, discussing, and arriving at a recommendation or decision. Often, in \nthese roles we play as ASH professionals, it is our job to help our clientele eventually arrive \nat a suitable and safe answer by “asking the right questions” and/or encouraging the client \nto arrive at the most important questions that get to the root of their concerns. In this case, \nChatGPT has been helpful for me in this role. \nIt is beyond the scope of this editorial, but several LLMs also provide the opportunity \nto include consideration of known, trusted, publicly acce ssible websites and documents \nthat the model considers in formulating an answer. While ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 only con-\nsiders “training data” collected and processed through late 2021 (Ray, 2023b) in its foun-\ndation in providing its responses, there are “plugins” available for free or at low cost that \nallow the user to specify specific technical information from which to formulate its answer. \nAdditionally, in the latter months of 2023, ChatGPT Plus does provide the opportunity to \n“browse” and include more current web-based information (Reuters, 2023). \nUse Case 2: Interpreting Research  \nArticles and Technical Information \nAs of the time of this writing, there are several methods that can be used to provide \nChatGPT 4.0 with more contextually important data from a specific article, paper, tran-\nscript, or other source of data and information. Recently, I had a specific need for a concise \nsummary of a public hearing done by California OSHA’s board on the safety and regula-\ntory stance for highly automated and autonomous agricultural machines and tractors in the \nstate (California OSHA Standards Board, 2023). In this situation, audio from the public \nhearing was available. After downloading the audio file, it was transcribed with software \n(Temi, San Francisco, CA), and the transcription was uploaded to ChatGPT 4.0 with a \nprompt to “summarize key points” from the hearing. The process to prepare the data and \nquery the LLM took less than 15 minutes, allo wing me to grasp critical findings from a \ntwo-hour hearing that was quite difficult to follow given irrelevant parts of the conversa-\ntion, breaks, various interruptions, and its ov erall length. There are ChatGPT 4.0 plugins \nand other tools that will similarly directly summarize YouTube videos and other “public \ninformation” videos. These plugins use transcripts as text-based input data, providing con-\ncise summaries, outlines, or responses to other user prompts. \n \n208  Journal of Agricultural Safety and Health \nUse Case 3: Summarizing Incident  \nReports and Suggesting Trends, Common  \nDenominators and Appropriate Messaging \nIn 2020, well prior to the release and widespread use of ChatGPT, we presented a paper \non the “learnings” from the analysis of a large collection of publicly available tractor fatal-\nity reports from NIOSH through the FACE program (Sandner et al., 2021). This work was \nintensive and required manual coding of detailed incident reports, analysis using traditional \ndescriptive data, ANOVA, and other analysis. In addition, a simple program was developed \nin Python to randomly select data from the coded selection of all reports (items like tractor \nmodel and configuration, terrain, slope, obstacles, operation at the time of rollover, envi-\nronmental conditions, etc.), generating entirely new, synthesized cases that can be used to \nperform risk analysis by engineers and technologists. \nLLMs present an alternative but important and interesting option for these same data \nthat are now only available in a narrative, text-only format, such as incident investigation \nreports, news accounts, and coroner’s reports. As an example of what is possible, I have \nselected three FACE state reports from three states, all of which involved an overturned \ntractor. I selected the three most recent overt urns from the state-FACE website (NIOSH, \n2023), also with the criteria of having three different states represented. The reports se-\nlected were from Washington State (WA Stat e FACE Program, 2023), Michigan (Michi-\ngan FACE Program, 2019), and Iowa (Iowa State FACE Program, 2006). The case inves-\ntigation PDF files were downloaded and combined into a single document. The plugin \nAskYourPDF Pro (AskYourPDF, 2023) was used to upload the combined file to be used \nin ChatGPT 4.0. The Appendix contains the responses to these three prompts: \n1. There are three specific reports—one from Iowa, one from Michigan, and one from \nWashington. Can you provide a brief summary of each using the information and \nspecific factual information from the report. \n2. As you examine these three incidents, please provide a ten item list of incident trends, \ncommon denominators, or lessons learned that would be important to discuss if you \nwere doing a safety presentation using case studies for a group of farmers or hired \nfarmworkers? All should have some tie to these specific cases. \n3. We are planning to implement a social media campaign. Please provide five tweets \non farm safety and tractor rollover or overturn protection that considers the specifics \nof these three incidents. The tweets should not reference the specific states or specific \ndetails from the individual cases, but should instead be more general in nature, yet \nshould be specific to tractor rollover safety. \nUse Case 4: Support Tool to Interpret and Guide  \nthe Use of Engineering and Regulatory standards \nEngineering and regulatory standards and practices documented via standards are often \ndensely written, complex, and confusing, but they are foundational to much of the work in \nagricultural safety and health. Examples include the standard Lighting and Marking of Ag-\nricultural Equipment on Highways - (ASABE Standards, 2019) and the Manure Storage \nSafety Engineering Practice (ASABE Standards, 2022). These documents usually contain \ntechnical language, jargon, or cross-references  to other standards, practices, and specific \n \n29(4): 205-224  209 \nterms or phrases that are defined within the standard itself. As will be described in the \nsection that follows, the process of training  an LLM using the specific content within an \nASABE, ANSI, or ISO standard presents difficulty because these documents are obtained \nthrough purchase and are copyrighted and are not considered “sharable” or open-source \nintellectual property. \nHowever, there are ASABE standards that are made “publicly available” through vari-\nous means. In preparing to write this article, I experimented using ChatGPT 4.0, the previ-\nously mentioned PDF conversion plugin, and the ASABE standard Cotton Module Cover \nMaterial Performance (ASABE Standards, 2022), as it was publicly available for use with-\nout concerns on copyright infringement of misuse of intellectual property. While this stand-\nard is not explicitly connected to safety, it is complex and structured in a similar way to \nmany ASABE (and ISO) safety standards. Queries about that standard’s content included \nthings like drafts of compliance checklists, bulleted summary outlines of the standard, or \nother key features. The prompts I provided yielded accurate, though somewhat incomplete, \nsummaries from the LLM. This application woul d seem useful as a tool to understand, \ninterpret, and create actions that are based on  standards, but should not be viewed as a \nreplacement for thoroughly understanding all aspects of specific engineering standards or \nengineering practices. \nSimilarly, regulatory standards can be queried. As an example, the entire OSHA Part \n1928 Occupational Safety and Health Standards for Agriculture standard (OSHA, 1971) \nfor agriculture was uploaded to ChatGPT 4.0 through the PDF plugin. Queries included: \n• I am an agricultural safety and health specialist at a land grant university. I have been \nasked to provide a 30-minute summary of key parts of the OSHA Part 1928 Occupa-\ntional Safety and Health Standards for Agriculture standard. My audience is crop and \ndairy farmers in Wisconsin. What are key topics I should include in my presentation? \nPlease provide at least 10 bulleted, high-lev el issues to cover based on the standard \nwith three to four sub bullets under each of the main topics. \n• Now, assume I am a farmer and I want to develop a compliance checklist with spe-\ncific things I need to do, conditions I ne ed to examine for regulation compliance, \nspecifically with tractor and machinery safety, and other actions necessary to comply \nwith pertinent sections of OSHA 1928. Please provide a comprehensive checklist \nthat will help me to comply. \n• As a farmer, I think all of these are important. But, I would like to have you expound \nmore on the checklist item that says: \"Train operators to reduce speed when turning, \ncrossing slopes, and on ro ugh or slippery surfaces.\" Please provide more detail and \nsuggestions of where I might learn more about this particular item. \nNote that an LLM trained on specific data and information can provide summary and \nexplanatory detail at various levels, starting with a high-level overview, translating regula-\ntory text into actionable things like checklists, and then drilling down on specific content \nthrough further inquiry. Of course, the resulting output would need to be reviewed, cross-\nreferenced with the original source material, and fact-checked for accuracy, especially in \nsituations where highly specific recommendations are being given. \n \n210  Journal of Agricultural Safety and Health \nUse Case 5: Outlining and Brainstorming Content  \nfor Presentations, Articles, and Research Questions \nIn my professional role, the ability to quickly use an LLM to brainstorm content for a \nlecture, presentation, outline for a press release,  or draft set of research questions is an \namazing timesaver. In my Extension role, I get called on to do about 8-10 major keynote \npresentations each year at organizational annual conferences, national or state meetings, or \nother specialty events for industry organizations. This is in addition to many smaller local \nor regional sessions. These begin with an exploratory phone call or email from an outside \norganizer who might have a general idea for a desirable topic(s). After the conversation, \nwe will narrow the focus of the request. There is usually a promise that I will formulate a \ntitle, bulleted summary, and short descriptor that can be printed in the promotional materi-\nals. The use of ChatGPT 4.0 has saved me dozens of hours on this follow up task. \nIn my workflow prior to using an LLM, I would capture notes during a conversation \nand then try to meet the organizer’s final deadlines, often two or three months down the \nroad—often as they were preparing to print a final program agenda. This workflow was \npart procrastination, but also part wanting to really give the request adequate thought over \ntime. However, as deadlines near, the process of reconstructing the original conversation, \nremembering my thoughts several months prior, and then sending the information before \nthe deadline is stressful and takes much last minute mental rumination. As I have begun to \nuse ChatGPT to assist with this workflow in recent months, here is an example of a very \nrecent prompt that I have since used several times with success: \n“I was just contacted by a national organization whose members provide (fill in info) \nagricultural services for (fill in info) growers throughout North America. They have \nasked me to provide a 50-minute presentatio n that covers three topics. These are: \nstress and mental health in (fill in info) production; specific safety recommendations \nto consider during busy times of the year for (fill in info) production; and an overview \nof new and exciting digital technologies coming in the next five to ten years in the \n(fill in info ) industry. Please provide an interesting and compelling title for this \npresentation. Also provide a short, compelling, and fun sounding 125-word summary \nof my talk and a suggested outline that will cover each of my main topics dividing it \ninto three equal pieces, with two to three bullets per section and three bullets under \neach major point.” \nAs an outcome of using this prompt in recent months, in one instance, I was given ten \npotential titles by the LLM. I picked one that resonated and asked it to iterate on my favor-\nites with three alternative versions, deciding immediately on one. The 125-word summary \nwas well-crafted from my iterated title, and I was able to immediately send it to the sponsor \nwith just a few minutes of minor edits that better reflected my writing style and tone. The \nentire follow-up process took less than a half hour, and I met my deadline for the organizer \nthat same afternoon. This would have normally taken days of thought, and I would have \nlikely waited until the last minute to meet dead lines, often with an end result of lesser \nquality due to the time lag from the initial conversation and the rush to meet the deadline. \nI have had similar success in planning and organizing clas sroom lectures, brainstorming \ntitles, and outlining papers. While these might seem to be simplistic workflow examples, \nthe time savings has been significant, allowing me to spend more time on the science and \n \n29(4): 205-224  211 \ncontent, developing deeper understandings, concentrating on analysis and nuance, and im-\nproving the quality of the end product. \nThree Caveats, Pitfalls, and Cautions \nI am convinced, through my experimentation this past year, that LLMs and generative \nAI, more broadly, are game changers. This includes impacts on time management and \nproduct quality and the ability to use these tools to expand one’s thinking and creativity. \nThey can also add a degree of confidence and thoroughness by making suggestions and \nproviding new ideas that the user may not have considered without an additional tool that \nhelps with thinking. I view generative AI as an assistant—not a replacement. Output needs \nto be carefully examined for completeness and accuracy and should never be viewed as a \n“replacement for” expert human-based guidance. Despite my enthusiasm for this technol-\nogy, here are some specific caveats.\n \nPotential for Misleading, Inaccurate, or even “Hallucinated” Outputs \nIt is quite possible and even common for an LLM to provide superficial, out-of-context, \nor inaccurate responses, often due to a lack of training data (Ray, 2023b). Future versions \nare likely to improve over time. But LLMs function by ingesting prompts, converting them \nfor model use, and then responding through natural human language in a serial way, word-\nby-word, using probabilities and statistical methods that predict what word “should” come \nnext based on billions or trillions of data points based on training data (Wolfram, 2023). \nIn cases where the model does not have access to adequate training data, many models will \nhallucinate or make up answers (Alkaissi and McFarlane, 2023). Users must be extremely \ncautious and always double check, cross-reference, and use past education and experience-\nbased knowledge. This issue can be somewhat alleviated by supplying key information \nthrough thorough prompts or using plugins that reference specific websites, data sets, or \nother online information. It is concerning to hear that “AI could fully takeover” the role of \nexperts (Liu et al., 2020) in key areas, but it still takes skill and knowledge to develop \nprompts, review output, and especially to continue to develop the knowledge bases that feed \nand train these tools through research and communication. It is also important that future \nLLM models that are used for these purposes have a greater degree of transparency, enabling \nthe user to understand sources of key information and to provide accurate citations. \nUse of Copyrighted or Proprietary Information in Open Source Commercial Models \nCopyright and intellectual property implications associated with LLM use are in a state \nof flux as LLMs are a technology still in its infancy stages (Kahveci, 2023; Strowel, 2023). \nCurrently, with ChatGPT 4.0, the last data that was used for base model training purposes \nis from 2021. Other models and future versions can reference more current websites and \nother specific resources and references. It is and will be tempting to use plugins to upload \nthe kinds of materials discussed in this ar ticle—engineering standards, journal articles, \ntextbook chapters, etc. But it is very important to understand the legal implications of pro-\nprietary data uploaded and used to inform a specific LLM “session.” In some cases, there \nare concerns that the data fed into and used by the model will eventually become part of \nthe model’s current or future training, making it available for all users. This sharing of \ncopyrighted or proprietary information in “training” would not be legal via other historical \nforms of media and technology (like sharing copyrighted content on a website, distributing \nphotocopies, etc.). There are enterprise versions of these tools (OpenAI, 2023b) that tout \n \n212  Journal of Agricultural Safety and Health \nthe use of private data that can only be accessed by the local user who owns or has the \nrequisite permissions to use these data in analysis, guaranteeing that use will only remain \nlocal and that it will not be used broadly for base model training. But this is an area that is \ncomplex, in flux, and will likely be the subject of litigation and legal scholar analysis for \nat least the next decade. For now, be careful and know the law as well as the terms of \nservice for any model or application you might use. \nBias \nThere are many forms of bias that can result from the perspectives that are digitally \nembedded in the billions of pieces (tokens) of data used to train LLMs like ChatGPT 4.0. \nThese are extensively described by Ray (2023b), who describes examples of cultural, lin-\nguistic, ideological, temporal, and other biases in detail. As an example, in the farm safety \nand health “practice,” there is much techni cal information and best practice content for \nfarmers and ranchers in the public domain. These data are likely to have been gathered and \nsummarized during the training of commercially available LLMs through access to univer-\nsity extension websites, fact sheets, posted videos, news reports, and other forms of infor-\nmation. These data, when used to train a commercial LLM, could tend to bias the responses \nof users more toward U.S. perspectives as an audience and, even more specifically, toward \nWhite (European American) farm owners and operators, who have tended toward being \nthe most targeted historical audience that mu ch content has been developed for over the \nlast several decades. Further, responses and the content used would be more concentrated \nin specific geographic regions of the country where there have been more university spe-\ncialists preparing and posting such information, more funding, and more research activity. \nResponses could likely tend toward not fully considering the current and future needs of \nimmigrant and migrant farmworkers, non-English speakers, and other underserved audi-\nences who are becoming increasingly important to feeding a growing global population. \nAnd this does not even consider that the vast majority of people worldwide involved in \nfood production are actually located outside of the U.S. and North America (FAO, 2020). \nWe will need to continue to be aware of and account for other forms of bias and make \nadditional adjustments both in terms of the development of LLMs as well as their judicious \nuse. \nConclusion \nWe stand on the threshold of a new era—the widespread use of different forms of AI \nand especially the integration of Large Language Models into everyday work, including \nthe efforts of those in the field of Agricultural Safety and Health is now here. Developing \nan understanding of these tools, their uses, limitations, and risks is not just an option—it's \nan imperative. These tools offer opportunities to accelerate and translate technical data and \nresearch, enhance education, and improve on-the-ground safety practices. However, they \ncome with a set of ethical and practical challenges that we must navigate conscientiously. \nThe call to action is clear: it is time for practitioners in our field to collaborate and discuss \nhow we might best harness the power of these digital tools. By doing so, we can unlock \nthe full potential of AI to make groundbreaking contributions to agricultural safety and \nhealth, setting a global standard for responsible innovation. \n \n29(4): 205-224  213 \nAcknowledgments \nThis work has been partially supported by  the USDA National Institute of Food and \nAgriculture, Hatch Project 1022349. \nReferences \nAlkaissi, H., & McFarlane, S.
