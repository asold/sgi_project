INTRODUCTION\nP\nOWER transformers that have been in operation for over\n20 years in the state grid are slowly approaching the end\nof their lifetime service [1]. These aged transformers may con-\ntinue to serve technically; however, the safety and reliability\nof the power system is threatened due to the deterioration of\npower transformer insulation systems, and the high cost of\noperation and maintenance that increases over time, resulting\nin high risk costs [2]. Therefore, the problem of improper\nmaintenance or premature retirement of power transformers\nis an ongoing research focus in the electrical power industry.\nCurrently, most transformers are replaced based on service\ntime. Parts of transformer that are performing well are retired\nin advance due to ignorance of their economic performance,\nManuscript received February 10, 2015; revised May 12, 2015; accepted\nJuly 3, 2015.

Thus,\nin order to maximize the lifetime of transformers and to\nensure their operational reliability, it is necessary to assess\nthe economic life of transformers [3]–[6].\nIn current practice, there is not yet a uniﬁed assessment cri-\nterion to determine a power transformer’s economic life since\nvery little research has been devoted to this area. Reference [7]\nhas proposed a method for evaluating the economic life of\npower transformers that take into consideration many factors\nsuch as energy cost, social beneﬁts and environmental beneﬁts.\nIt then evaluates the economic life quantitatively using an\noptimized index of a synthesis of economic beneﬁts. Refer-\nence [8] divides the economic life model into two modes—\na dynamic mode, which considers the time value of money,\nand a static mode, which does not. The dynamic mode is\nsuitable for assessing long-term device investment strategies.\nReference [9] analyzes the economics based on the operation\nrange of transformer distributions for load adjustment and load\ndistribution, and then proposes a load adjusting method by\nreducing peaks and ﬁlling up valleys. However, these works\nhave limitations in engineering applications, because they only\nconsider the device’s economic beneﬁts in particular cases,\nand fail to conclude an economic assessment index system\nfor power transformers. In [10] Liu analyzes the economic\nfactors of power transformers, and establishes an economic\nlife model based on a maintenance and retirement strategy for\npower transformers, which has seen favorable engineering ap-\nplicability. However, accurate and efﬁcient assessment is still\na challenge due to the imperfect analysis of economic factors,\nwhich is why an economic life model based on continuous\noperation should be set up for comparison purposes.\nIn this study, the economic life model of a power trans-\nformer is further analyzed. A new economic life model based\non continuous operation is proposed, and more factors such as\noperation energy cost, system load shedding cost, fault recov-\nery cost—all are taken into the index system. The improved\neconomic life model complies better with the requirements\nof engineering applications, and is of optimal use for power\ntransformers. The model can also provide practical value\nto raising the economic efﬁciency of the power grid while\nimproving the management of electrical equipment.\nII. M ODEL ESTABLISHMENT\nA. Factors of Economic Life\nThe remainder life of power transformers consists of their\ninsulation life, reliability life, and economic life. While the\n2096-0042 c⃝ 2015 CSEE\nW ANGet al.: ECONOMIC LIFE ASSESSMENT OF POWER TRANSFORMERS USING AN IMPROVED MODEL 69\nformer two parts can be speciﬁcally assessed [11]–[14], the\neconomic life, which is a game between revenue and cost,\nis difﬁcult to assess. The common method for economic\nlife assessment is comparing the revenue and the cost of\ntransformers in a given period, accompanied by a retirement\nstrategy that is acceptable only if the revenue is less than the\ncost in that period.\nMany factors must be taken into consideration in the as-\nsessment of transformer revenue and cost, making the process\nboth subjective and random. As such, a relevant economic\nlife model needs to be established for quantifying the various\nfactors before the economic life assessment. The indices in the\nmodel should be consistent with the actual situation in order\nto satisfy the requirements of accuracy and applicability. Since\nthere is no agreed upon index system available for economic\nlife assessment, this paper will establish an index system for\nthe economic life assessment of power transformers on the\nbasis of [10], [15], as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe revenue of power supply\nThe operation maintenance cost\nThe fault risk cost\nThe generalized depreciation cost\nThe revenue of power supply\nThe operation maintenance cost\nThe fault risk cost\nThe generalized depreciation cost\nThe overhual cost\nThe revenue of power supply\nThe operation maintenance cost\nThe fault risk cost\nThe generalized depreciation cost\nIndex system of \ntransformer \neconomic life\nContinuous \noperation\nOverhaul\nRetirement\nFig. 1. Assessing index system of transformer economic life.\nThe index system is comprised of three sections: continuous\noperation, overhaul, and retirement. Each model comprises re-\nvenue of power supply, operation and maintenance costs, fault\nrisk costs, and generalized depreciation costs, whose value\nvaries with different models. In addition, the overhaul cost\nis considered independently in the overhaul model [16], [17].\nB. Assessment Procedure\nIn this section, the transformer economic life is divided\ninto three sections. The indices in the respective strategies are\nanalyzed and beneﬁts during different periods are calculated to\nobtain the economic life. It is assumed that the transformer’s\neconomic life begins to decline when the overhaul beneﬁts out-\nweigh the beneﬁts of continuous operation; it is also assumed\nthat the end of the economic life occurs when retirement\nbeneﬁts are greater than overhaul beneﬁts. This means that the\ntransformer needs to be retired immediately. The assessment\nprocedure is adopted as follows (Fig. 2):\nFirst, relevant economic indices of the transformer are\nanalyzed. Second, the fault probability curve of the operational\npower transformer is simulated, and then beneﬁts and cost of\ndifferent strategies in the given period are calculated. Finally,\nthe net income of each strategy is compared to obtain the\neconomic life.\nTransformer \neconomic life\nContinuous \noperation Overhaul Retirement\nIndies \nanalysis\nEconomic \nlife model\nBasic \nassumption\nLoad \ncondition\nAnnual net \nincome 1\nAnnual net \nincome 2\nAnnual net \nincome 3\n Economic life \nassessment\nFig. 2. Assessment procedure of transformer economic life.\nC. Basic Assumptions\nTo simplify the model without loss of generality, the fol-\nlowing basic assumptions are proposed through an analysis of\nexisting operating data [18].\n1) The fault probability curve of power transformers can\nbe calculated.\n2) Overhaul can decrease the fault probability of power\ntransformers. As shown in Fig. 3, the amplitude change\nincreases ﬁrst and then decreases as the operating time\nextends.\n3) The annual preventive maintenance cost of the trans-\nformers increases linearly with the operating time.\n4) Time consumption in terms of the overhaul increases\nlinearly with the operating time.\n5) The overhaul cost increases linearly with the operating\ntime.\n6) After the overhaul, the fault probability decreases to a\nnew point, and then follows the same fault probability\ncurve as before.\nIII. A NNUAL NET INCOME IN CONTINUOUS\nOPERATION MODEL\nAssuming the current moment t0, the transformer continues\nto operate at some moment t after t0. Then, we can calculate\nthe net income in this period.\n70 CSEE JOURNAL OF POWER AND ENERGY SYSTEMS, VOL. 1, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2015\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nService Age (year)\nDecrease Rate of Fault Probability (%) \nFig. 3. Inﬂuence of maintenance on the probability of failure.\nA. Revenue of Power Supply\nThe revenue of power supply comes from the beneﬁts of\nelectricity selling. This is primarily related to the load factor\nin the period and the price difference of electricity, which can\nbe expressed by:\nIP1 = ξSη∆p(t− t0) (1)\nwhere ξ indicates the contribution rate of power transformers\nthroughout the power supply chain. ∆pis the price difference\nof electricity. S is the capacity of power transformers. η is the\naverage load factor of power transformers.\nB. Operation Maintenance Cost\nThe operation maintenance cost is the sum of all the costs\nduring the entire transfomer life cycle, which can be estimated\nas follows:\nCO1 = COe1 + COm1 (2)\nwhere COe1 is the energy consumption cost of the transformer\nand COm1 is the preventive maintenance cost, including labor\ncost, environmental cost, maintenance fees, and so on.\n1) Energy Consumption Cost COe1: Energy consumption\ncost mainly refers to the loss of the transformer. According to\nthe calculation method in [19], energy consumption cost COe1\ncan be deﬁned as follows:\nCOe1 = (P0 + η2PK)p1µ(t− t0)8760 (3)\nwhere P0 indicates the no-load loss of power transformers\n(kW). PK indicates the load loss of power transformers (kW).\nη is the average load factor. µ is the annual load loss rate,\nwhich here takes 0.608 [19]. p1 is the purchase price per unit\nof electricity paid by users (Yuan/kWh).\n2) Preventive Maintenance Cost COm1: Based on as-\nsumption 3), the preventive maintenance cost COm1 can be\nestimated as follows:\nCOm1 = COb\nt∫\nt0\n(1 + α1t)dt (4)\nwhere COb is the annual basic maintenance cost obtained from\nstatistical data. α1 is the linear dependent coefﬁcient between\nthe maintenance cost and the age growth, which here takes\n0.004.\nC. Fault Risk Cost\nSince the transformer is a core equipment in the power\nsystem, a fault here can easily induce a fault in other connected\nelectrical equipment, leading to even accidents. The risk\nassessment can be written as follows:\nCR1 = LOTF · λ(t) (5)\nwhere CR1 is the risk value of the transformer (Yuan), λ(t) is\nthe occurrence probability of transformer fault, LOTF is the\neconomic losses of transformer fault, including system load\nshedding cost, fault recovery cost, personnel security cost, and\nenvironmental cost.\nLOTF = Loss1 + Loss2 + Loss3 + Loss4. (6)\nLoss1, Loss2, Loss3, and Loss4 are the system load shedding\ncost, the fault recovery cost, the cost of personnel security risk\nand the cost of environmental impact respectively.\nOnce a transformer breaks down, the loss of the system load\nshedding can be expressed by:\nLoss1 = SFθηβ1tr cos ϕ (7)\nβ1 = β11β12β13 (8)\nwhere S indicates the transformer capacity. cos ϕ is the\naverage power factor, here takes 0.9. η is the load factor\nof transformer. F is the probability of load shedding in\nthe sudden fault, here takes 0.05. tr is the mean time to\nrepair. θ is the value at risk per unit of electricity, here\ntakes 10,472.1 Yuan/MWh. β1 is the corrected parameters\nof system risk, including the signiﬁcance of substation β11,\nthe signiﬁcance of transformer load β12 and the factor of\nmaintenance environment β13 (shown in Table I).\nThe fault recovery cost includes material cost, manual work\ncost, and other expenses. The average fault recovery cost can\nbe estimated as follows:\nLoss2 = Cf β2 (9)\nβ2 = β21β22 (10)\nwhere Cf indicates the statistical fault recovery cost, according\nto the expert advice. β2 is the corrected parameters of repair\ncost, which consists of the factor of manufacturer β21 and the\nfactor of maintenance environment β22 (shown in Table I).\nThe personnel security risk refers to the personal injury\ncaused by fault. The severity can be assorted by the levels of\nminor injury, serious injury and death, and can be expressed\nas follows:\nLoss3 =\n3∑\ni=1\nSiri (11)\nwhere Si (i = 1, 2, 3) indicates the fault cost at different\nseverity levels, and takes 50,000 Yuan, 100,000 Yuan, 500,000\nYuan respectively. ri (i = 1, 2, 3) presents the different\nprobability, and takes 2%, 0.5%, and 0.1% respectively.\nThe cost of environmental impact means the risk cost of\nenvironmental pollution such as oil leaking, emission of CO 2\nand other poisonous gas after a transformer fault. The risk cost\ncan be estimated by the statistical data combined with expert\nadvice.\nW ANGet al.: ECONOMIC LIFE ASSESSMENT OF POWER TRANSFORMERS USING AN IMPROVED MODEL 71\nTABLE I\nCORRECTED PARAMETERS OF SYSTEM RISK AND REPAIR COST\nFactors The Selection of Corrected Parameters\nSigniﬁcance of\nsubstation\nLoad-center substation: β11 = 1.16. Connection\nsubstation: β11 = 1. Terminal substation: β11 =\n0.8.\nSigniﬁcance of\ntransformer load\nCritical load: β12 = 1.16. Moderate load or default:\nβ12 = 1.\nMaintenance en-\nvironment\nOutdoor substation: β13, β22 = 1. Indoor substation:\nβ13, β22 = 1.16.\nManufacture Local: β21 = 0.9; Domestic: β21 = 1. Overseas:\nβ21 = 1.3.\nFinally, the fault risk cost can be concluded as follows:\nCR1 =\nt∫\nt0\nλ(t)dt· LOTF (12)\nD. Generalized Depreciation Cost\nThe generalized depreciation cost refers to the entire dis-\nposable investment of the transformer during its lifetime. It\ncomprises equipment investment cost, installation cost, decom-\nmissioning disposal cost, retired residual, and other expenses;\nthe expression can be presented as follows:\nCD1 = (CI + CD+ Crc)t− t0\nTd\n(13)\nwhere CI is the initial investment cost, which consists of\nequipment procurement cost, installation cost and other ex-\npenses. CD is the decommissioning cost, which involves the\ndisposal cost and residual value. Crc indicates the loss of\noutage in the period of the equipment replacement. Td is the\ndesigned life of the transformer, provided by the manufacturer.\nThe initial investment cost can be estimated using engineer-\ning methods as follows:\nCI = CIE + CII + CIO (14)\nwhere CIE is the equipment procurement cost. CII is the\ninstallation cost, and CIO presents the spare cost in the\ninitial investment, which comprises the employee training cost,\nthe debugging cost of special projects, and the cost of the\ncondition monitoring devices.\nThe decommissioning cost is expressed as follows:\nCD = CDT − CDR (15)\nwhere the CDT is the disposal cost, which means the cost of\ndismantlement, transportation, and labor. CDR is the residual\nvalue based on the equipment procurement cost, which approx-\nimately equals 5% of the equipment procurement cost [16].\nCDT can be calculated as follows:\nCDT = CII · CCR (16)\nwhere CID is the direct cost of equipment installation, and\nCCR is the rate of equipment disposal, and CCR generally\ntakes 32% [15].\nIn conclusion, the total cost in continuous operations can\nbe presented as follows:\nC1 = CO1 + CR1 + CD1. (17)\nThe corresponding annual net income is shown as follows:\nW1 = IP1 − C1\nt− t0\n. (18)\nIV. A NNUAL NET INCOME MODEL IN OVERHAUL\nAssuming the current moment t0, the transformer will be\noverhauled at some moment t after t0. The fault probability\nand the risk cost will decrease after the overhaul based on\nassumption 2). The fault probability, which follows the origianl\ncurve will increase to λ(t) after ∆t based on assumption 6),\nwhich means the related period, is extended from t− t0 to\nt+ ∆t− t0 (shown in Fig. 4). Then, we calculate the net\nincome in this period.\nX 䖤\nY 䖤\nFund\nTimet + Δ ttt0\nΔ t\nCost\nIncome\nFig. 4. Cost income analysis of overhaul case.\nA. Revenue of Power Supply\nThe total revenue of power supply in the period after\noverhaul can be expressed by:\nIP2 = ξSη∆P(t+ ∆t− t0) (19)\nwhere the indicators are explained in Section III A.\nB. Operation Maintenance Cost\nThe operation maintenance cost in the overhaul model is\nexpressed by:\nCO2 = COe2 + COm2 = (P0 + η2PK)p1µ(t+∆t−t0)8760\n+ COb\nt+∆t∫\nt0\n(1 + α1t)dt (20)\nwhere the indicators are explained in Section III B.\nC. The Fault Risk Cost\nThe related fault risk cost can be presented by:\nCR2 = [\nt∫\nt0\nλ(t)dt+\nt∫\nt−∆t\nλ(t)dt] · LOTF (21)\nwhere the indicators are explained in Section III C.\n72 CSEE JOURNAL OF POWER AND ENERGY SYSTEMS, VOL. 1, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2015\nD. The Generalized Depreciation Cost\nThe generalized depreciation cost is shown as follows:\nCD2 = (CI + CD+ Crc)t− t0\nTd\n(22)\nwhere the indicators are explained in Section III D.\nE. Overhaul Cost\nThe overhaul cost in the moment tis shown as follows, and\nmainly involves the overhaul expense and the cost of outage\nrisk.\nCM2 = CMt + CMR (23)\nwhere CMt is the overhaul expense and CMR is the loss of\nthe outage risk.\nAccording to assumption 5), the calculation of CMt is\nexpressed by:\nCMt = (1 + α2t)Cb (24)\nwhere Cb is the basic cost for a single overhaul, and the value\nis determined by the average of statistical data combined with\nthe expert advice. t represents the transformer’s service age\n(year), and α2 is the linear dependent coefﬁcient between the\noverhaul cost and the age growth, here taken as 0.005.\nThe cost of outage risk can be calculated by\nCMR = trs · Crb (25)\nwhere Crb indicates the cost of outage risk per hour due to the\ndecline of redundancy rate of the grid, and estimated by (26).\ntrs is the overhaul time estimated by (27) based on assumption\n4).\nCrb = S∆p20% (26)\ntrs = tb + α3t (27)\nwhere tb represents the basic time of overhaul, and α3 is the\nlinear dependent coefﬁcient between the overhaul time and the\nage growth, here taken as 0.02.\nThe total cost in overhaul can be concluded as follows:\nC2 = CO2 + CR2 + CD2 + CM2. (28)\nThe related annual net income is shown as follows:\nW2 = IP2 − C2\nt+ ∆t− t0\n. (29)\nV. A NNUAL NET INCOME MODEL IN RETIREMENT\nAssuming the current moment t0, the transformer will be\ndecommissioned at some moment t after t0. Then we can\ncalculate the net income in the related period, namely t− t0.\nA. Revenue of Power Supply\nThe total revenue of power supply in the retirement strategy\ncan be expressed by:\nIP3 = ξSη∆P(t− t0) (30)\nwhere the indicators are explained in Section III A.\nB. Operation Maintenance Cost\nThe operation maintenance cost in the retirement model is\nexpressed by:\nCO3 = COe3 + COm3 = (P0 + η2PK)p1µ(t− t0)8760\n+ COb\nt∫\nt0\n(1 + α1t)dt (31)\nwhere the indicators are explained in Section III B.\nC. Fault Risk Cost\nThe related fault risk cost can be presented by:\nCR3 =\nt∫\nt0\nλ(t)dt· LOTF (32)\nwhere the indicators are explained in Section III C.\nD. Generalized Depreciation Cost\nThe generalized depreciation cost is shown as follows. It is\nimportant to note that the transformer designed life is replaced\nby the acutal service life in the denominator of the expression.\nCD3 = (CI + CD+ Crc)t− t0\nt (33)\nwhere, the indicators are explained in Section III D.\nThe total cost in retirement can be concluded as follows:\nC3 = CO3 + CR3 + CD3 + CI3. (34)\nThe related annual net income is shown as follows:\nW3 = IP3 − C3\nt− t0\n. (35)\nVI. E CONOMIC LIFE ASSESSMENT\nThe transformer’s economic life is divided into three sec-\ntions based on the criterion of annual net income: If the max-\nimum of annual net income is W1, this means the transformer\nought to be continuous operation; if the maximum of annual\nnet income is W2, this means the economic life begins to\ndecline, and the power transformer ought to be overhauled;\nﬁnally, if the maximum of annual net income is W2, this\nmeans the economic life has reached its end, and the power\ntransformer ought to be decommissioned.\nWe can also input all the relevant data of the current moment\nt0 to obtain the two intersections of three strategies, which\nrepresents the transformer’s economic life.\nVII. C ASE STUDY\nA power transformer of 31.5 MV A in Chongqing substation\nof 110 kV is studied here. The relevant data are shown in Table\nII and Table III.\nThe fault probability curve of the power transformer can be\ncalculated as follows:\nλ(t) = m\nη ( t\nη)m−1 = 0.1934(t+ 4.1\n28.65 )4.566.

Annual Net Income in Continuous Operation\nIn order to compare the economic life models of different\nstrategies, the period in the continuous operation model should\ncorrespond with that in the overhaul model, namely, the period\nin the calculations should be t+ ∆t− t0.\nAccording to Table III and (1), the revenue of power supply\nshould be:\nIP1 = 1655640(t+ ∆t− t0). (39)\nThe operation maintenance cost is calculated as:\nCO1 = 149993.49(t+ ∆t− t0) + 20000\nt+∆t∫\nt0\n(1 + 0.004t)dt.\n(40)\nThe fault risk cost is needed to calculate the economic\nloss of the transformer fault ﬁrst. Since the connection is\nthe outdoor substation, and the load is classiﬁed as moderate\nloading, then β1 takes 1. The mean time to repair tr takes\n17.57 h [20]. In this way, the system load shedding cost is\nobtained:\nLoss1 = 156487.57. (41)\nSince the transformer is a domestic product, the β2 takes\n0.9, according to Table III. Then the fault recovery cost can\nbe obtained:\nLoss2 = 80 · 104 · 0.9 = 720000 (42)\nThe cost of personnel security risk and the cost of environ-\nmental impact are respectively presented as follows:\nLoss3 = 2000Loss4 = 130000. (43)\nThe fault risk cost can be calculated according to (12):\nCR1 =\nt∫\nt0\nλ(t)dt· 1008487.57. (44)\nThe equipment procurement cost of this transformer is two\nmillion Yuan. The installation cost is CII = 20,470 Yuan, and\nthe spare cost CIO = 200,000 Yuan, as stated in [15].\nThe disposal cost CDT is 6550 Yuan, the residual value\nCDR is 100,000 Yuan, so the decommissioning cost CD is\n−934,500 Yuan, according to (15) and (16).\nConsequently, the generalized depreciation cost is shown as\nfollows:\nCD1 = 2157000t− t0\n30 .

(48)\nThe generalized depreciation cost is obtained as follows:\nCD2 = 2157000t− t0\n30 . (49)\nThe overhaul cost is obtained as follows:\nCM2 = 120000 + 200000\nt+∆t∫\nt0\n(1 + 0.005t)dt\n+ 1260 · (120 + 0.48t).

Annual net income for three strategies.\nThe current service time of the power transformer is 25\nyears. This can be obtained from Fig. 5 where before T =\n28.39, the strategy of overhaul has a higher net income, and the\nstrategy of retirement will be accepted for more beneﬁts after\nT = 28.39. We may safely conclude that the economic life\nof this transformer is about 3.39 years based on the principle\nof the maximum annual net income. If we assume the current\nservice age is 15 years, then it will be proﬁtable to adopt the\nstrategy of continuous operation; in other words, the economic\nlife of this transformer will begin to decline after 8.85 years.\nIn order to prove the validity of the proposed model, 5\ndifferent transformers in Chongqing have been assessed, and\nthe results are revealed in Table IV .\nAccording to the results presented in Table IV , the proposed\nmodel can assess the residual economic life of a power\ntransformer effectively. Results show the total economic life\nis basically around 30 years, which corresponds to the opera-\ntional situation.\nTABLE IV\nEXAMPLES OF ECONOMIC LIFE ASSESSMENT\nNo. V oltage\nLevel (kV)\nCommissioning\nDate Testing Date Residual\nEconomic Life\n1 110 2000-05-01 2013-12-17 13.53\n2 110 2008-11-18 2011-10-14 25.82\n3 220 2001-06-30 2014-02-20 16.31\n4 220 2011-11-01 2013-09-17 29.13\n5 500 2001-06-19 2010-12-25 26.79\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the economic life model of three strategies\nis established for the assessment of transformer economic\nlife. First, the economic indices in the different strategies\nare analyzed, and the maximum average annual net income\nis determined as a criterion of comparison. Next, on the\nbasis of reasonable assumptions, the revenue and the costs\nare calculated respectively under different situations. Finally,\nthe transformer economic life is assessed quantitatively by\ncomparing the annual net income of the different strategies.\nThe proposed model is generally applicable in most cases.\nThe fault probability curve of the power transformer can\nbe ﬁtted by the statistical data. Consequently, the decreased\ndegree of fault probability after overhaul will be taken into\naccount. The relevant parameters in the model can be obtained\nby the manufacturer’s information and operation data. The\nresidual economic life of testing the transformer will be\nachieved ultimately by comparing the different strategies.\nThe case study proves preliminarily the feasibility and\nvalidity of the proposed economic life model and its ability to\nprovide the electric power enterprise with a reference method\nto develop a more proﬁtable plan for the maintenance and\nretirement of power transformers.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Yiyi Zhang and M.S.\nFanjin Meng for their kind support in the research.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “The 2010 annual professional summary report of transformer equip-\nment in State Grid,” China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing,\nChina, 2011.\n[2] H.
