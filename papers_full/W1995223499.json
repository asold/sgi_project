  "full_text": "Tool use in the tuskﬁsh Choerodon schoenleinii?\nJane Goodall describes tool use as the use\nof an external object as a functional\nextension of mouth or hand in the\nattainment of an immediate goal (van\nLawick-Goodall 1970). Tool use is often\nobserved in a foraging context in a wide\nrange of species, and complex feeding\nbehaviors are not uncommon among marine\nﬁshes. For instance, wrasses crunch sea\nurchins against corals and use anvils to\nsmash food into more manageable pieces\n(Pas´ko 2010, reviewed in Brown et al.\n2006). In spite of the anecdotal evidence for\nthe use of tools in marine ﬁshes, there are\nfew documented cases, particularly those\nbased on observations in the wild. Here, we\npresent evidence of a black spot tuskﬁsh,\nChoerodon schoenleinii, Valenciennes,\n1839 using a rock as an anvil to open a\ncockleshell that conforms to Goodall’s\ndeﬁnition of tool use.\nOn 12 November 2006, S. Gardner was\nreturning from an 18-m dive in the Keppel\nregion of the southern Great Barrier Reef\n(–23.199/C176S, 151.099/C176E) when he heard a\ncracking noise and saw a tuskﬁsh\nhovering just above a sand patch near a\nrock grasping a cockle in its mouth. The\nphotographs span 75 s and show the ﬁsh\ngrasping the shell in its jaws and rolling\nonto its side to land alternate blows on the\nrock until the shell fractured (Fig. 1a–f).\nThe use of a rock as an anvil rather\nthan a hammer could be considered\na sign of intelligence considering the\nineffectiveness of manipulating a freely suspended tool in water. The images certainly provide an interesting starting point for\nfurther comparative studies on tool use in ﬁshes.\nReferences\nBrown C, Laland K, Krause J (2006) Fish cognition and behaviour.
