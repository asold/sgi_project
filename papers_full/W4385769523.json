    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), in particular, diverse versions of Chat GPT, have been setting the agenda for expectations of artificial general intelligence (AGI) once again. Here, it will be argued that such expectations will not be satisfied by LLMs. The argumentation will not focus on concrete technical specifics of LLMs that hinder the materialization of AGI. It is rather the AGI itself that lacks the means for being realized. From a techno-social systems perspective, neither LLMs nor AGI can be called intelligent. Only (human) social systems, including techno-social systems, or humans or living systems or other physical systems that self-organize can show the feature of intelligence, but not man-made technological tools. The argumentation will cover praxiological, ontological and epistemological considerations.",
