The main reason of\ntransformer failure is due to failure in its insulation, such as\nbushing and windings [2]. The failure is mainly due to partial\ndischarge (PD), which is the energy dissipation caused by the\nlocalized electric-ﬁeld intensity buildup [3]. The charge buildup\nand its release during PD can be the indication of problems\nrelated to aging, such as the presence ofﬂoating components,\ndegradation, and failure of transformer insulation. Therefore,\nPD detection is used in power systems as a diagnostic tool\nto investigate the condition of a new or in-service insulation\nsystem of high-voltage (HV) equipment [4].\nIn the high-frequency range, thetransfer function-based (TF)\nanalysis of the power transformers’ winding is commonly used\nin various power engineering applications. These include tran-\nsient analysis, insulation coordination, and transformer design.\nTF applications were used for diagnostic purposes, which led to\nthe detection of turn-to-turn short circuit or insulation defects,\nsuch as PD within insulation [5]. If a PD is detected, the exact\nlocalization of the defect in the transformer is very important for\nmaintenance or repair. Although localization of the PD in trans-\nformer winding using the winding transform function is pos-\nsible, the method has limitations[5], [6]. This is especially for\nold transformers, where the design data, such as winding type,\nnumber, and type of disks, turnnumber in each disk, and dimen-\nsion of the winding do not exist. This information is needed in\nthe winding TF technique to localize the PD in a transformer.\nThese days, there are various ways or techniques to localize\nPD occurrence in a transformer. The standard conventional\ntechnique measures the short current pulse whichﬂows through\nthe insulation defect where the discharge occurs [7]. These\nPDs are detected through a recharge process from a coupling\ncapacitance. Another electrical method use RF antennas to\nmeasures the RF emissions occurring due to very short duration\nelectrical pulses created by PD current in the defect/void [8].\nPD sources, which emit acoustical waves directly through oil\nto the transformer tank wall,can be localized by measuring\nacoustical and electrical PD signals simultaneously. The loca-\ntion of the PD source is then calculated from the time delay\nbetween the electrical and acoustical PD signals using the\ntriangulation method [4], [9]. On the other hand, the location\nof PD in the transformer winding can also be established\nusing the multiconductor transmission-line model (MTLM).\nThrough this model, a comparison between the measured and\ncalculated transfer function allows the best model parameters to\nbe obtained, which are then usedfor PD localization [10]. The\ncapability of optical sensors for PD detection has already been\nproven [11]–[13]; however, the methodology for identiﬁcation\n0885-8977 © 2014 IEEE.

General overview of system classiﬁcation.\nand localization of PD sources using optical sensors is still\nunder investigation [14].\nPrevious attempts toﬁnd features that localize PD in trans-\nformers in general were found to be less successful. Therefore,\nthis paper proposed a technique to localize PD in transformers\nin general, which depends on a system that changes its rules ac-\ncording to a certain case. In this technique, a system that can\nﬁnd a nonlinear relationship between features and PD location\nis required for transformers without design data. The proposed\ntechnique adapted a neurofuzzysystem that uses unsupervised\npattern recognition, based on the changes in the shape of PD\nsignals. In the experimental work, PD signals were injected into\n30 transformer-winding points and detected at the bushing and\nneutral ends. They are corona, void, and surface discharge. The\nreason for taking PD measurements at both bushing and neutral\nends in this work is to compare which point of measurement\nwill give a better correct prediction of different types of PDs.\nThe PD localization was determined for each measurement re-\nsult using orthogonal transforms, the calibration line method,\nand the proposed neurofuzzy technique. The results were com-\npared to evaluate the advantages of the proposed method.\nThe work is organized as such. Section II explains the\nmathematical background of pattern-recognition methods that\nwere used, Section III presents the methodology of the work,\nSection IV shows the measurement and test circuit diagram,\nand Section V describes the results that were obtained from\npower transformer testing and PDlocalization results. Finally,\nSection VI concludes this paper and suggests future work for\nthe improvement of the proposed method.\nII. P\nATTERN-RECOGNITION METHOD\nIn machine learning, patte rn recognition is assigned ac-\ncording to a speciﬁc algorithm of an output value (or label) to\na given input value (or instance) [15]. Orthogonal transforms\nin pattern recognition enable a noninvertible transformation to\na reduced dimensionality of the feature space from a pattern\nspace. In PD localization, the main reason for orthogonal trans-\nforms is the generation of the output signal, which has valuable\nfeatures. The transform-based features are reliable because\nan appropriately chosen transform can remove redundancies\nof information, which normally exist in samples from the\nmeasuring instrument [16], [17].\nTo ﬁnd the location of the PD, thedistance between features\nby using appropriate orthogonal transforms is obtained by using\nsimilarity and dissimilarity formulas on the transformed signals.\nFig. 1 shows a general overview of system classiﬁcation. Test\nand training patterns were processed for its feature measurement\nand classiﬁcation.\nA. Karhunen–Loève Transform (KLT)\nThe Karhunen–Loève Transform (KLT) is a well-known\nlinear transformation technique that removes redundancy by\ndecorrelating the data. Thus, a signal can be stored more\neffectively and can be usedfor data compression andﬁltering\n[18], [19]. KLT was ﬁrst used in optimal transformation of\nrandom signals of 3.4 (the optimal here means a minimization\nof mean square error between data vector “x” and the trans-\nformed vector “X”, with the number of coefﬁcients used for the\nretransformation being smaller than the number of coefﬁcients\nof the original vector [20]). The orthogonal KLT transformation\nmatrix\ncalculation is assisted by an autocorrelation matrix\nA of an “x” random sequence. For any sequence of “x.,” the\nautocorrelation matrix A is given by\n(1)\nThe eigenvalues of the autocorrelation matrix computation\nallow its eigenvectors to be calculated, which are the columns\nof transformation matrix\nfor KLT. The eigenvectors arrange-\nment, which corresponds to the absolute values of their eigen-\nvalues, yields in a transformation matrix, as follows:\n(2)\nIn order to localize PD in transformers, the computation of\nthe features of the signals transformed by KLT is advantageous.\nThe share of relative energy of a reference signal in a data signal\nexempliﬁes a good choice.\nB. Discrete Cosine (DCT) and Sine (DST) Transforms\nThe discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete sine trans-\nform (DST) are Fourier-related transforms, such as the discrete\nFourier transform (DFT). However, only real numbers are used\nin DCT and DST. Therefore, they are equivalent to DFTs of\napproximately twice the length. The applications of DCT and\nDST are in digital signals, image processing, and in trans-\nforming coding systems for data compression/decompression\n[21]. However, the energy compaction method of DCT and\nDST is better than DFT, that is, input data can be packed into\na few numbers of coefﬁcients [22], [23]. Also, the amount of\nenergy packing by DCT and DST is higher than DFT for highly\ncorrelated signals. The DCT for a data vector of\nsamples is\ndeﬁned by the transform matrix, as deﬁn e db y( 4 ) ,w h i l ef o r\nDST, it is deﬁned by\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\nwhere is the DST and DCT in convolution form,and are\na number, and is the block size.\n2068 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY , VOL. 29, NO. 5, OCTOBER 2014\nC. Hadamard and Haar Transforms\nThe wavelet has been popular in various transient analysis\napplications, especially in signalsynthesis and analysis, pattern\nrecognition, signal and image processing, denoising, and com-\npression. Hadamard and Haar transforms are computationally\nadvantageous over DCT and DST transforms. The Haar func-\ntion is deﬁned as a characteristic function of an interval (0, 1).\nThe shape of the family of\nHaar functions, and of a\ngiven index depends on two parameters and\n(6)\nFor , and are determined uniquely, so that\nand is the remainder, where .W h e n ,\nthe Haar function is deﬁned as\n(7)\nWhen\notherwise.\nAn example of a 44 Haar transformation matrix is as follows:\nThis indicates that\n(8)\nThis shows the orthogonality of . The main advantage of\nthe Haar transform is its provision of a multistage analysis rather\nthan a unique transform, and itscapability for data compression\nat some resolution levels in pattern-recognition problems [24].\nMost of the energy that is focused in some samples consists of\na considerable amount of information.\nThe Hadamard transform is regarded as exemplifying a gen-\neralized class of Fourier transforms. The Hadamard transform\nis considered as being built out of size-2 DFTs through decom-\nposing an arbitrary input vector into a superposition of Walsh\nfunctions. The Hadamard unitary matrix of order “\n”\nis a matrix and is generated by the iteration rule as shown\n(9)\nD. Similarity and Dissimilarity Formulas for Clustering\nFig. 2 shows a clustering method that is proposed in this work\nfor PD localization in transformers. The algorithm is mainly\nbased on assigning N featuresvector to M clusters, with\n.T h eﬁrst feature vector is allocated to theﬁrst cluster.

METHODOLOGY\nTechniques to locate PD sources are important in transformer\ndiagnosis and maintenance. However, locating PD source accu-\nrately is difﬁcult due to the complex structure of transformers.\nPD pulses suffer from dispersion and attenuation when they\ntravel from the original location to the measuring point. Al-\nthough the PD signal detected bymeasuring device is highly\nattenuated compared to its original location, it contains useful\ninformation regarding the location and nature of PD. If this in-\nformation is extracted and analyzed, the PD source location can\nbe determined [25].\nThere have been many investigations on PD localization\ntechniques. However, most of them use functions based on\nsupervised pattern recognition, i.e., some experiments were\nperformed ofﬂine on the winding, producing a technique that\nfunctions according to the extracted features. Sometimes, there\nis also no data available for old transformers or due to the\nlost of documents. Thus, supervised pattern recognition-based\nmethods cannot be used for these cases. In order to have a\ncomprehensive method that can be used for data-less trans-\nformers, in this work, a localization technique, which relies\non the features of the signal propagating from the neutral and\nbushing ends are used.\nFig. 3 shows theﬂowchart of the performed experimental test.\nThe main problem in PD signalsr e c o r d i n gi sah u g en u m b e r\nof samples, where each signal vector has more than 6000 sam-\nples. Therefore, only valued information was observed via or-\nthogonal transformation of the vectors. As long as there was\nparallel information in a signal vector, orthogonal transforms\nwere used to reduce the number of samples and eliminate any\nworthless information. For KLT and Hadamard transforms, the\nnumber of samples must be\n, e.g., if a signal vector\nhas 6000 samples, the vector can be fed with only 2048 or 4096\nsamples.\nFive transform methods were used to localize PD signals;\nthey were KLT, DST, DCT, HAAR and HADAMARD. They\nwere used in the calculation of similarity and dissimilarity for-\nmulas to evaluate the effectiveness in locating PD signals in a\ntransformer. To be more precise, the injected signals in neutral,\nclamp no. 3 and clamp no. 15 are called as A, B and C respec-\ntively. Using similarity and dissimilarity techniques, the simi-\nlarity between B/A is checked if it is more than C/A once all\nsignals are recorded in neutral.\nPD signals are localized with an interval error within the\nrange of the PD injection point. For example, it is assumed that\nthe method is successful if it estimates PD location in the neigh-\nborhood radius of 10% from the injection point. The calibration\nline and similarity and dissimilarity formulae were used to esti-\nmate the PD location. Then, the error for the actual PD location\nwas calculated.\nPreviously, authors had shown that statistical features of sig-\nnals are not a reliable value to determine the location of PD [17].\nEach orthogonal transforms were used and similarity and dis-\nsimilarity formulas made a feature. However, the linear feature\nof the signals will not lead to successful localization. Therefore,\na new neuro-fuzzy based technique was proposed in this work.\nT h em o s ts u i t a b l ef e a t u r ew a sused to create a feature vector of\nthe neuro-fuzzy system. The feature vectors of 30 injected sig-\nnals were tested using the proposed method to show the ability\nof the proposed neuro-fuzzy method in localizing the PD.\nIV. M\nEASUREMENT\nIn this section, the experiment setup and measurement circuit\nare described. The results obtained using different localization\nmethods are shown in this section.\nThe test object was one phase of 63 kV/20 kV , 30 MV A trans-\nformer winding, which the transformer’s tank was removed. The\nhigh-voltage winding is a disk type and has 58 disks. To ac-\ncess the internal points along the winding, a small portion of\npaper insulation with bordered winding turns was removed and\nconnections along the winding were established. A connection\nwas brought out from each odd disk (i.e. 28 brought out con-\nnection). Taking into account theline-end and neutral-end con-\nnections, 30 connections along the winding were available for\nPD signal injections. The low-voltage winding and regulating\nvoltage winding with coarse andﬁne parts were installed in-\nside and outside of the main high-voltage winding. This was\ndone to replicate test conditions which are similar to the ac-\ntual test conditions. An aluminum cylinder was placed inside\nthe low-voltage winding to simulate the effect of the core.\nFig. 4 shows the test object before the installation of\nvoltage-regulating winding. PD signals for different kind of\nPD (i.e. corona, surface discharge and void) were created with\nPD signal generator and were injected into all 30 connections\nthat are available along the winding while they were detected\nusing clamps at neutral and bushing ends (refer to step 1 and 2\nof ﬂowchart Fig. 3). Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) shows the experiment\ns e t u pf o rr e c o r d i n gt h eP Di nbushing end and neutral end\nrespectively. The test circuit consists of a transformer winding,\noscilloscope, personal computer (PC), PD calibrator and a\ncoupling capacitor\nof 1000 pF.\nThe coupling capacitor is used for the transfer of the high-\nfrequency PD signal appearingacross the transformer winding\nto the measuring impedance at low attenuation.

Experimental setup with detection impedance for recording at (a) the\nbushing end and (b) neutral end.\nbehavior of the transformer bushing can also be represented,\nin principle, to . In these cases, the bushing tap test of the\nbushing that is usually used for loss factor measurement, is used\nfor recording the PD signal. Hence, if the transformer under test\nhas bushing tap on the line side, the separate\nfor recording\nthe PD in the line end [Fig. 5(a)] can be removed. The same\nconcept is used for removing the external\nfor recording PD\nin the neutral end [Fig. 5(b)] if the neutral side has a bushing tap\ntest (for transformers with bushings in the neutral).\nThe sampling rate of the used oscilloscope was 500 Mb/s. It\nshould be noted that the applied corona and void voltage were 2\nkV while the applied surface voltage was 4 kV. During the test,\nthe tap position of the regulating-voltage winding was such that\nthe coarse andﬁne parts were pointing outward. Thus, modeling\nthe regulating-voltage winding was not needed. Channel 1 of the\noscilloscope was connected to the bushing and channel 2 was\nconnected to neutral. Both bushing end connections and neutral\nend of the winding are connected to the detection impedance,\nas shown by\nand , which consist of the equivalent resistor,\ninductance, and capacitor. In thistest, two detection impedances\nof 50 were used as the detection impedance to decouple the\nPD signals. The calibration signals were 500 pC.\nSix signals were used in the proposed localization technique\nof this paper. They are as follows:\n1) a calibration signal injected at the neutral end and mea-\nsured at the bushing end, produced an input feature vector\nwhich is equal to one for the output;\n2) a calibration signal injected at the neutral end and mea-\nsured at the neutral end, produced an input feature vector\nwhich is equal to zero for the output; this signal enables the\neffect of the detection equipment on the waveform of the\nPD signal to be evaluated;\n3) a calibration signal injected at the bushing end and mea-\nsured at the neutral end, produced an input feature vector\nwhich is equal to one for the output;\n4) a calibration signal injected at the bushing end and mea-\nsured at the bushing end, produced an input feature vector\nwhich is equal to zero for the output;\n5) an actual PD signal that originated from the transformer\nand reached the neutral end which needs to be localized;\n6) an actual PD signal that originated from the transformer\nand reached the bushing end which needs to be localized.\nSince PD signals deteriorate when they travel through the\nwindings, PD location will affectits features. Therefore, the\nrelationship between PD location and the features of the mea-\nsured signal needs to be obtained. For the proposed method, the\nwinding length is normalized to one. This means that if a signal\nis injected into neutral and received at the bushing end, it has a\nfeature that indicates 1. If a PD signal is injected in the middle\nof the windings, it indicates 0.5.\nDifferent kinds of PD signals were created by the PD signal\ngenerator. The device can create a signal similar to the char-\nacteristic of actual corona/surface discharge/void PD which are\ndifferent in terms of rising time, energy of signal, etc.\nIn this experiment, the detected signals at the bushing end and\nneutral end were displayed on an oscilloscope. To eliminate the\nsurrounding effect, the experiment was repeated four times for\neach clamp. Hence, 360 PD signals were injected to the trans-\nformer (three different kinds of PD signals\n30 disks 4 times\nfor each disk). The features of the signals were observed so that\nthe most suitable feature for PDlocalization can be selected.\nFinally, the estimated location of PD, based on its features, was\ncompared with the actual PD location.\nV. R\nESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIn this section, a case study on an actual power transformer is\nexplained.

Figs. 6–11 show\nthe recorded raw signals in bushing and neutral ends due to the\ninjection of different PD signals to disks number 1, 21, and 51.\nTo make all of the signals comparable, they were normalized\nﬁrst. All signals were divided on the maximum value of itself.\nIt can be seen from the following rawﬁgures that the recorded\nsignals consist of many data. To eliminate parallel information\nand reduce the number of samples, the signals need to be trans-\nformed ﬁrst by applying orthogonal transforms to each signal.\nSince providing normalized signals for all of the recorded\nsignals will make the manuscript lengthy, only normalized\nrecorded signals at the neutral and bushing ends due to corona\npulses injection into the winding disks no. 1, 21, and 51 are\nshown in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively.\nDistortions of the recorded signals depend on the distance in\nwhich the pulses traveled through the winding.

PD Localization Using the Calibration Line Method\nThrough Orthogonal Transforms\nThe analysis wasﬁrst performed on the recorded signals with\ninjected corona signals. Since the location of the injection as the\ncorona signal is known, the combination of different orthogonal\ntransfers with similarity and dissimilarity formula on recorded\nsignals was tested if it can successfully localize the corona. The\nsuccessfully localized disks were deﬁned since the estimation\nof the location of PD injection points has an error of less than\n20%. Tables I and II show the number of disks successfully lo-\ncalized from recorded signals at the neutral and bushing ends\nfor corona discharge. The calibration method was used to cal-\nculate the location of the PD and localization error.\nThe best localization featuresfor corona discharge are shown\nby the highlighted cells in TablesI and II, that is, they localized\nthe corona signals for more than half of the number of injection\npoints (i.e., 30 points). From Table I, KLT and HADAMARD\nHOMAEI et al.:P DL O C A L I Z A T I O NI NP O W E RT R A N S F O R M E R S 2073\nTABLE III\nNUMBER OF DISKS SUCCESSFULLY LOCALIZED FROM THE RECORDED SIGNALS\nAT THENEUTRAL AND BUSHING ENDS FOR SURFACE DISCHARGE\ntransforms can be said to be the most successful transforma-\ntion for corona signals localization when recorded at the bushing\nend. From Table II, DST, DCT, and HADAMARD transforms\nare regarded as successful transformations for corona-injected\nlocalization when recorded at the neutral end. From Tables I and\nII, the HAAR transform did not localize PD successfully. Thus,\nit was omitted from further analysis. Besides, among six dif-\nferent similarity and dissimilarity formulas, which were tested\nat this level, since similarity formula 16 and dissimilarity for-\nmula 12 were not successful in recording from the bushing and\nneutral ends, these two formulas were omitted for further anal-\nysis as well.\nThe experiment was repeated for surface discharge. All pro-\ncedures were similar to corona discharge, except surface dis-\ncharge signals were injected into the winding.\nTable III shows the number of disks successfully localized\nfrom recorded signals at the neutral and bushing ends for surface\ndischarge injection. The same as the previous test, the best lo-\ncalization features for surface discharge are shown by the high-\nlighted cells in this table too. The results show that the transform\nmethods, which successfully localized the number of disks for\nsurface discharge injection and recorded in neutral and bushing\nends, are the same as that of the corona discharge, although\nthere are differences in corona and surface discharge signals.\nSince all four different similarity and dissimilarity formulas at\nthis stage have shown successful behavior in their combination\nwith at least one of the orthogonal transfers, none of them were\nomitted. However, since there was no successful result in using\nthe Hadamard transform when the signal was recorded in the\nbushing, this transform was omitted for further analysis in the\nnext stage.\nThe same experiment was repeated for void discharge.\nTable IV shows the number of disks successfully localized\nfrom the recorded signals at the neutral and bushing ends for\nvoid discharge. From Table IV, the highest number of disks\nsuccessfully localized is in the bushing-end recording for void\ndischarge and obtained from the combination of KLT transform\nand dissimilarity formula no. 11 (with\n3).\nLooking back at Tables I–IV, the best combination of or-\nthogonal transfers with a similarity and dissimilarity formula\nthat are suitable for all kinds of PD injection is from the result\nrecorded in the bushing end from the KLT transfer with dis-\nsimilarity formula no. 11 and\n3. The recorded signal from\nthis combination was the most comprehensive and the method\nTABLE IV\nNUMBER OF DISKS SUCCESSFULLY LOCALIZED FROM RECORDED SIGNALS AT\nTHE NEUTRAL AND BUSHING ENDS FOR VOID DISCHARGE\nwas “semi-successful” in localizing the PD with maximum ac-\ncuracy. However, the highest number of successful localization\nwith this combination for void discharge is 14 out of 30 (refers\nto Table IV) which means that maximum successful localiza-\ntion is less than 50%. Thus, this indicates that the method of\ncombining orthogonal transfers with the similarity and dissim-\nilarity formula is not very successful in localizing PD in the\ntransformer winding for various kinds of discharge.\nC. PD Localization Using the Calibration Line Method\nThrough the Granular Clustering Technique\nSince the previous method was not totally successful, lo-\ncalization of the PD was performed using the calibration line\nmethod through the granular clustering technique. In this tech-\nnique, after recording the signals in bushing and neutral ends,\nthey were normalized and, then, the respective granular were\nmade using the granular clustering techniques. The generated\ngranular showed a point in the space which can represent the\nentire signal’s feature. The distance between this point with the\nrepresentative point of the recorded signal in bushing or neutral\nends was considered as the estimated point of PD location\nby the granular clustering technique. Like previous tests, if\nthis estimated location by granular clustering was in the 10%\nneighborhood radius of the actual location of the signal, the\nestimated localization was considered successful.\nThe number of disks successfully localized from the recorded\nsignals at the neutral and bushing ends using the calibration line\nmethod through the granular clustering technique are shown\nbrieﬂy in Table V. It can be seen that this method is reason-\nably good in PD localization, especially for corona discharge\nwhich was recorded in the bushing with 23 successful local-\nizations out of 30. Looking back at sections B and C and all\ncompleted tests showed that the linear calibration method ei-\nther by using orthogonal transform techniques and similarity\nformulas or using the granular clustering technique was not a\nreliable method and it was an incomprehensive method to lo-\ncalize the PD location. Thus, the aforementioned fact pushed\nthe author to propose a new nonlinear technique. Creating the\nproposed nonlinear system was done by using MATLAB Neuro-\nfuzzy functions. The descriptionis provided in the next section.\nD. Proposed Nonlinear-Based Technique for PD Localization\nAs shown in the last two sections, using orthogonal trans-\nforms and similarity and dissimilarity formulas, the success rate\n2074 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY , VOL. 29, NO. 5, OCTOBER 2014\nTABLE V\nNUMBER OF DISKS SUCCESSFULLY LOCALIZED FROM RECORDED SIGNALS AT\nTHE NEUTRAL AND BUSHING ENDS USING THE CALIBRATION LINE METHOD\nTHROUGH THE GRANULAR CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE\nFig. 15. Flowchart of the proposed nonlinear-based PD localization system.\nof PD localization can be seen low, by referring to Tables Ito IV.\nAlthough the granular clustering technique is better than the\northogonal transform in terms of the number of successful PD\nlocalizations, it can only be considered as a semisuccessful\nmethod. In this section, a new technique, which shows a better\nresult than even granular clustering for PD localization, will be\nintroduced.\nSince no speciﬁc linear relation between PD localization and\ntwo previous studied methods was found, the new technique\noffered was based on a nonlinear system. To avoid any bias\nand unsupervised technique, two neuro-Fuzzy functions that can\ngenerate a rules-based nonlinearsystem were chosen. In these\nsystems, rules were created based on the relation between in-\nputted data which are signals features and outputted data which\nare PD locations. Consequently, the neuro-fuzzy localization\nsystem has no bias. This is because neuro-fuzzy functions have\na priority of calculation without any bias. The neuro-fuzzy sys-\ntems were produced using two MATLAB functions. Then, the\nsystems were trained and the system parameters were optimized\nvia test feature vectors. Theﬂowchart of the new technique is\nshown (Fig. 15).\nTo create the 0 and 1 of the system, theﬁrst four signals out\nof 6 signals were generated, which were described in Section IV\n(measurement section). The signals, which were recorded in the\nsame point where the injection was done, were representative\nof 0, and the signal which was recorded in the other side of the\ninjection point represented 1. Thus, in this stage, there are two\n0’s and two 1’s as the location for the system.\nTABLE VI\nFIRST EIGHT MOST SUCCESSFUL FEATURES INLINEAR PD LOCALIZATION\nBased on Fig. 3, a feature vector should be produced for each\nof the previous four signals. A feature vector (FV) represents\nthe recorded signals and feeds to the localization system. The\nFV has a structure foreach disk as follows:\nwhere Gclus is the granular clustering, and features 1 to 8 are the\nﬁrst eight most satisfying features that had a maximum number\nof successful linear localizations from Tables I– IV. The afore-\nmentioned nine elements of the feature vector were bolded and\nhighlighted in red in Tables I–V. The characteristics of each fea-\nture in the aforementioned vector based on Tables I–V are given\nin Table VI again.\nIn this paper, two standard MATLAB fuctions—genﬁs1 and\ngenﬁs2—were used. The ﬁrst function genﬁs1 generated a\nsingle-output Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system (FIS) using\na grid partition on the data (no clustering) while the second\nfunction genﬁs2 generates a Sugeno-type FIS using subtractive\nclustering.\nFour signals, which are the same four signals recorded\nthroughout different experiments, were injected four times into\neach disk and were injected repeatedly to create, train, and\ntest the neuro-fuzzy system. After that, the feature vector was\nproduced for each of the 30 other clamps. The results were 30\nfeature vectors (FV1 to FV 30), wh i c hw e r ef e dt ot h et r a i n e d\nneuro-fuzzy system and 30 estimated PD locations obtained\nHOMAEI et al.:P DL O C A L I Z A T I O NI NP O W E RT R A N S F O R M E R S 2075\nTABLE VII\nNUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL PD LOCALIZATIONS FOR EACH SYSTEM\nUSING THE NEURO-FUZZY TECHNIQUE\nTABLE VIII\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN MINIMUM ANDMAXIMUM SUCCESSFUL LOCALIZATION\nESTIMATION FOR DIFFERENT PD LOCALIZATION METHODS\nfrom the neuro-fuzzy system’s output. The estimated PD lo-\ncations from each neuro-fuzzy system were compared by the\nactual location of PD injection,and successful or unsuccessful\nlocalization was obtained.\nTable VII shows the number ofsuccessful PD localizations\nfrom each neuro-fuzzy system. Theresults show that the neuro-\nfuzzy system genﬁs2, which is based on subtractive clustering,\nis more reliable for PD localization.\nTable VIII summarizes the ability of successful localization\nfor different PD localization methods. The minimum and max-\nimum successful estimation of the proposed technique using the\ngenﬁs2 neuro-fuzzy system was 73% (i.e., 22 successful local-\nizations out of 30 disks) and 93% (i.e., 28 successful localiza-\ntions out of 30 disks), respectively, which is a great improve-\nment over the calibration method with a maximum successful\nlocalization of 76% (i.e., 23 successful localizations out of 30\ndisks), which is better than genﬁs1.\nVI. C\nONCLUSION\nA nonlinear neuro-fuzzy localization system that uses unsu-\npervised pattern recognition wassuccessfully proposed in this\npaper to localize PD in power transformers. From the test per-\nformed on an MV transformer winding in the laboratory, the\nresults have shown a signiﬁcant improvement in localizing PD\nfor three types of PDs comparedto the linear calibration method\nthrough orthogonal transforms or granular clustering. The pro-\nposed nonlinear method was based on a PD localization system\nwhose rules were created based on the relation between inputted\ndata which are signals features and outputted data, which are PD\nlocations. Since the four signals, which are needed to create and\ntrain the proposed nonlinear-based method in this work, were\ninjected or recorded at accessible bushing and neutral ends, the\nproposed method can be used to localize the PD for live trans-\nformers. Future work will consider the optimization of feature\nvectors, the development of neuro-fuzzy systems, the impact of\ntransformer bushing on the signal waveform, and using the pro-\nposed method on multiple locations of PD occurring at the same\ntime.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] A.
