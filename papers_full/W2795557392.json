  "abstract": "Multi-conductor transmission line (MTL) model of power transformer winding for frequency response analysis (FRA) has been successfully applied for the purpose of studying the characteristics of winding deformations. Most of the time it is considered that, at a frequency above 10 kHz, the flux does not penetrate the core, and the iron core losses due to hysteresis and eddy current can be neglected accordingly. However, in fact, there is still a little flux residing in the core, and it has a significant influence on inductances and resistances of transformer winding even up to approximately 1 MHz. In this paper, by introducing the anisotropic complex permeability of the lamination core into calculating inductances and resistances of the MTL model, a new MTL model considering the frequency-dependent property of the lamination core for FRA is presented. In addition, the accuracy and effectiveness of the MTL model are validated by means of a comparison between measured and emulated FRA results in a wide frequency range from 10 Hz up to 10 MHz. This precise MTL model of the transformer winding provides us a more objective and positive condition for simulation research of winding deformation detection.",
