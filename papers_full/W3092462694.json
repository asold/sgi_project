However,\nit suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution, due to the\nlimitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature maps. To\nmitigate these issues, we proposed Deformable DETR, whose attention modules\nonly attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Deformable\nDETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects)\nwith 10×less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is released at https://\ngithub.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nModern object detectors employ many hand-crafted components (Liu et al., 2020), e.g., anchor gen-\neration, rule-based training target assignment, non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing.\nThey are not fully end-to-end. Recently, Carion et al. (2020) proposed DETR to eliminate the need\nfor such hand-crafted components, and built the ﬁrst fully end-to-end object detector, achieving very\ncompetitive performance. DETR utilizes a simple architecture, by combining convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) encoder-decoders. They exploit the ver-\nsatile and powerful relation modeling capability of Transformers to replace the hand-crafted rules,\nunder properly designed training signals.\nDespite its interesting design and good performance, DETR has its own issues: (1) It requires\nmuch longer training epochs to converge than the existing object detectors. For example, on the\nCOCO (Lin et al., 2014) benchmark, DETR needs 500 epochs to converge, which is around 10 to 20\ntimes slower than Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015). (2) DETR delivers relatively low performance\nat detecting small objects. Modern object detectors usually exploit multi-scale features, where small\nobjects are detected from high-resolution feature maps. Meanwhile, high-resolution feature maps\nlead to unacceptable complexities for DETR. The above-mentioned issues can be mainly attributed\nto the deﬁcit of Transformer components in processing image feature maps. At initialization, the\nattention modules cast nearly uniform attention weights to all the pixels in the feature maps. Long\ntraining epoches is necessary for the attention weights to be learned to focus on sparse meaning-\nful locations. On the other hand, the attention weights computation in Transformer encoder is of\nquadratic computation w.r.t. pixel numbers. Thus, it is of very high computational and memory\ncomplexities to process high-resolution feature maps.\nIn the image domain, deformable convolution (Dai et al., 2017) is of a powerful and efﬁcient mech-\nanism to attend to sparse spatial locations. It naturally avoids the above-mentioned issues. While it\nlacks the element relation modeling mechanism, which is the key for the success of DETR.\n∗Equal contribution. †Corresponding author. ‡Work is done during an internship at SenseTime Research.\n1\narXiv:2010.04159v4  [cs.CV]  18 Mar 2021\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nDecoder\nObject Queries\nBounding Box Predictions\n× 4\nMulti-scale Feature Maps\nEncoder\nMulti-scale Deformable\nSelf-Attention in Encoder\nMulti-scale Deformable \nCross-Attention in Decoder\nTransformer \nSelf-Attention in Decoder\nImage\nImage Feature Maps\n× 4\nFigure 1: Illustration of the proposed Deformable DETR object detector.\nIn this paper, we propose Deformable DETR, which mitigates the slow convergence and high com-\nplexity issues of DETR. It combines the best of the sparse spatial sampling of deformable convo-\nlution, and the relation modeling capability of Transformers. We propose the deformable attention\nmodule, which attends to a small set of sampling locations as a pre-ﬁlter for prominent key elements\nout of all the feature map pixels. The module can be naturally extended to aggregating multi-scale\nfeatures, without the help of FPN (Lin et al., 2017a). In Deformable DETR , we utilize (multi-scale)\ndeformable attention modules to replace the Transformer attention modules processing feature maps,\nas shown in Fig. 1.\nDeformable DETR opens up possibilities for us to exploit variants of end-to-end object detectors,\nthanks to its fast convergence, and computational and memory efﬁciency. We explore a simple and\neffective iterative bounding box reﬁnement mechanism to improve the detection performance. We\nalso try a two-stage Deformable DETR, where the region proposals are also generated by a vaiant of\nDeformable DETR, which are further fed into the decoder for iterative bounding box reﬁnement.\nExtensive experiments on the COCO (Lin et al., 2014) benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach. Compared with DETR, Deformable DETR can achieve better performance (es-\npecially on small objects) with 10 ×less training epochs. The proposed variant of two-stage De-\nformable DETR can further improve the performance. Code is released at https://github.\ncom/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR.\n2 R ELATED WORK\nEfﬁcient Attention Mechanism. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) involve both self-attention\nand cross-attention mechanisms. One of the most well-known concern of Transformers is the high\ntime and memory complexity at vast key element numbers, which hinders model scalability in many\ncases. Recently, many efforts have been made to address this problem (Tay et al., 2020b), which can\nbe roughly divided into three categories in practice.\nThe ﬁrst category is to use pre-deﬁned sparse attention patterns on keys. The most straightforward\nparadigm is restricting the attention pattern to be ﬁxed local windows. Most works (Liu et al.,\n2018a; Parmar et al., 2018; Child et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2019; Wang et al.,\n2020a; Hu et al., 2019; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Ainslie\net al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020) follow this paradigm. Although restricting the attention pattern\nto a local neighborhood can decrease the complexity, it loses global information. To compensate,\nChild et al. (2019); Huang et al. (2019); Ho et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2020a) attend key elements\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nat ﬁxed intervals to signiﬁcantly increase the receptive ﬁeld on keys. Beltagy et al. (2020); Ainslie\net al. (2020); Zaheer et al. (2020) allow a small number of special tokens having access to all key\nelements. Zaheer et al. (2020); Qiu et al. (2019) also add some pre-ﬁxed sparse attention patterns to\nattend distant key elements directly.\nThe second category is to learn data-dependent sparse attention. Kitaev et al. (2020) proposes a\nlocality sensitive hashing (LSH) based attention, which hashes both the query and key elements to\ndifferent bins. A similar idea is proposed by Roy et al. (2020), where k-means ﬁnds out the most\nrelated keys. Tay et al. (2020a) learns block permutation for block-wise sparse attention.\nThe third category is to explore the low-rank property in self-attention. Wang et al. (2020b) reduces\nthe number of key elements through a linear projection on the size dimension instead of the channel\ndimension. Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Choromanski et al. (2020) rewrite the calculation of self-\nattention through kernelization approximation.\nIn the image domain, the designs of efﬁcient attention mechanism (e.g., Parmar et al. (2018); Child\net al. (2019); Huang et al. (2019); Ho et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2020a); Hu et al. (2019); Ramachan-\ndran et al. (2019)) are still limited to the ﬁrst category. Despite the theoretically reduced complexity,\nRamachandran et al. (2019); Hu et al. (2019) admit such approaches are much slower in implemen-\ntation than traditional convolution with the same FLOPs (at least 3 ×slower), due to the intrinsic\nlimitation in memory access patterns.\nOn the other hand, as discussed in Zhu et al. (2019a), there are variants of convolution, such as\ndeformable convolution (Dai et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2019b) and dynamic convolution (Wu et al.,\n2019), that also can be viewed as self-attention mechanisms. Especially, deformable convolution\noperates much more effectively and efﬁciently on image recognition than Transformer self-attention.\nMeanwhile, it lacks the element relation modeling mechanism.\nOur proposed deformable attention module is inspired by deformable convolution, and belongs to\nthe second category. It only focuses on a small ﬁxed set of sampling points predicted from the\nfeature of query elements. Different from Ramachandran et al. (2019); Hu et al. (2019), deformable\nattention is just slightly slower than the traditional convolution under the same FLOPs.\nMulti-scale Feature Representation for Object Detection. One of the main difﬁculties in object\ndetection is to effectively represent objects at vastly different scales. Modern object detectors usually\nexploit multi-scale features to accommodate this. As one of the pioneering works, FPN (Lin et al.,\n2017a) proposes a top-down path to combine multi-scale features. PANet (Liu et al., 2018b) further\nadds an bottom-up path on the top of FPN. Kong et al. (2018) combines features from all scales\nby a global attention operation. Zhao et al. (2019) proposes a U-shape module to fuse multi-scale\nfeatures. Recently, NAS-FPN (Ghiasi et al., 2019) and Auto-FPN (Xu et al., 2019) are proposed\nto automatically design cross-scale connections via neural architecture search. Tan et al. (2020)\nproposes the BiFPN, which is a repeated simpliﬁed version of PANet. Our proposed multi-scale\ndeformable attention module can naturally aggregate multi-scale feature maps via attention mecha-\nnism, without the help of these feature pyramid networks.\n3 R EVISITING TRANSFORMERS AND DETR\nMulti-Head Attention in Transformers. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) are of a network\narchitecture based on attention mechanisms for machine translation. Given a query element (e.g.,\na target word in the output sentence) and a set of key elements (e.g., source words in the input\nsentence), the multi-head attention module adaptively aggregates the key contents according to the\nattention weights that measure the compatibility of query-key pairs. To allow the model focusing\non contents from different representation subspaces and different positions, the outputs of different\nattention heads are linearly aggregated with learnable weights. Let q∈Ωq indexes a query element\nwith representation feature zq ∈RC, and k∈Ωk indexes a key element with representation feature\nxk ∈RC, where C is the feature dimension, Ωq and Ωk specify the set of query and key elements,\nrespectively. Then the multi-head attention feature is calculated by\nMultiHeadAttn(zq,x) =\nM∑\nm=1\nWm\n[ ∑\nk∈Ωk\nAmqk ·W′\nmxk\n]\n, (1)\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nwhere mindexes the attention head, W′\nm ∈RCv×C and Wm ∈RC×Cv are of learnable weights\n(Cv = C/M by default). The attention weights Amqk ∝exp{\nzT\nq UT\nm Vmxk√Cv\n}are normalized as∑\nk∈Ωk\nAmqk = 1 , in which Um,Vm ∈ RCv×C are also learnable weights. To disambiguate\ndifferent spatial positions, the representation features zq and xk are usually of the concatena-\ntion/summation of element contents and positional embeddings.\nThere are two known issues with Transformers. One is Transformers need long training schedules\nbefore convergence. Suppose the number of query and key elements are ofNq and Nk, respectively.\nTypically, with proper parameter initialization, Umzq and Vmxk follow distribution with mean of\n0 and variance of 1, which makes attention weights Amqk ≈ 1\nNk\n, when Nk is large. It will lead\nto ambiguous gradients for input features. Thus, long training schedules are required so that the\nattention weights can focus on speciﬁc keys. In the image domain, where the key elements are\nusually of image pixels, Nk can be very large and the convergence is tedious.\nOn the other hand, the computational and memory complexity for multi-head attention can be\nvery high with numerous query and key elements. The computational complexity of Eq. 1 is of\nO(NqC2 + NkC2 + NqNkC). In the image domain, where the query and key elements are both of\npixels, Nq = Nk ≫C, the complexity is dominated by the third term, as O(NqNkC). Thus, the\nmulti-head attention module suffers from a quadratic complexity growth with the feature map size.\nDETR. DETR (Carion et al., 2020) is built upon the Transformer encoder-decoder architecture,\ncombined with a set-based Hungarian loss that forces unique predictions for each ground-truth\nbounding box via bipartite matching. We brieﬂy review the network architecture as follows.\nGiven the input feature maps x ∈RC×H×W extracted by a CNN backbone (e.g., ResNet (He et al.,\n2016)), DETR exploits a standard Transformer encoder-decoder architecture to transform the input\nfeature maps to be features of a set of object queries. A 3-layer feed-forward neural network (FFN)\nand a linear projection are added on top of the object query features (produced by the decoder) as\nthe detection head. The FFN acts as the regression branch to predict the bounding box coordinates\nb ∈[0,1]4, where b = {bx,by,bw,bh}encodes the normalized box center coordinates, box height\nand width (relative to the image size). The linear projection acts as the classiﬁcation branch to\nproduce the classiﬁcation results.\nFor the Transformer encoder in DETR, both query and key elements are of pixels in the feature maps.\nThe inputs are of ResNet feature maps (with encoded positional embeddings). Let Hand W denote\nthe feature map height and width, respectively. The computational complexity of self-attention is of\nO(H2W2C), which grows quadratically with the spatial size.\nFor the Transformer decoder in DETR, the input includes both feature maps from the encoder, and\nN object queries represented by learnable positional embeddings (e.g., N = 100). There are two\ntypes of attention modules in the decoder, namely, cross-attention and self-attention modules. In the\ncross-attention modules, object queries extract features from the feature maps. The query elements\nare of the object queries, and key elements are of the output feature maps from the encoder. In it,\nNq = N, Nk = H ×W and the complexity of the cross-attention is of O(HWC2 + NHWC ).\nThe complexity grows linearly with the spatial size of feature maps. In the self-attention modules,\nobject queries interact with each other, so as to capture their relations. The query and key elements\nare both of the object queries. In it, Nq = Nk = N, and the complexity of the self-attention module\nis of O(2NC2 + N2C). The complexity is acceptable with moderate number of object queries.\nDETR is an attractive design for object detection, which removes the need for many hand-designed\ncomponents. However, it also has its own issues. These issues can be mainly attributed to the\ndeﬁcits of Transformer attention in handling image feature maps as key elements: (1) DETR has\nrelatively low performance in detecting small objects. Modern object detectors use high-resolution\nfeature maps to better detect small objects. However, high-resolution feature maps would lead to an\nunacceptable complexity for the self-attention module in the Transformer encoder of DETR, which\nhas a quadratic complexity with the spatial size of input feature maps. (2) Compared with modern\nobject detectors, DETR requires many more training epochs to converge. This is mainly because\nthe attention modules processing image features are difﬁcult to train. For example, at initialization,\nthe cross-attention modules are almost of average attention on the whole feature maps. While, at\nthe end of the training, the attention maps are learned to be very sparse, focusing only on the object\n4\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n0.2\n0.3\n0.5\n0.4\n0.2\n0.4\n0.3\n0.4\n0.3\nAggregate\nAggregate\nAggregate\nValues \n{\n𝑾\n𝑚\n′\n𝑥\n}\nSampling\nOffsets\n{\n∆\n𝒑\n𝑚𝑞𝑘\n}\nAttention Weights \n{\n𝑨\n𝑚𝑞𝑘\n}\nOutput\nQuery Feature\n𝒛\n𝑞\nInput Feature Map \n𝒙\nReference Point\n𝒑\n𝑞\n(\n𝑝\n𝑞𝑥\n,\n𝑝\n𝑞𝑦\n)\nHead\n1\nHead\n2\nHead\n3\nHead\n1\nHead\n2\nHead\n3\nHead\n1\nHead\n2\nHead\n3\nSoftmax\nLinear\nLinear\nLinear\nLinear\nHead\n1\nHead\n3\nHead\n2\nAggregated Sampled Values\nFigure 2: Illustration of the proposed deformable attention module.\nextremities. It seems that DETR requires a long training schedule to learn such signiﬁcant changes\nin the attention maps.\n4 M ETHOD\n4.1 D EFORMABLE TRANSFORMERS FOR END-TO-END OBJECT DETECTION\nDeformable Attention Module. The core issue of applying Transformer attention on image feature\nmaps is that it would look over all possible spatial locations. To address this, we present adeformable\nattention module. Inspired by deformable convolution (Dai et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2019b), the\ndeformable attention module only attends to a small set of key sampling points around a reference\npoint, regardless of the spatial size of the feature maps, as shown in Fig. 2. By assigning only a\nsmall ﬁxed number of keys for each query, the issues of convergence and feature spatial resolution\ncan be mitigated.\nGiven an input feature map x ∈RC×H×W , let qindex a query element with content feature zq and\na 2-d reference point pq, the deformable attention feature is calculated by\nDeformAttn(zq,pq,x) =\nM∑\nm=1\nWm\n[ K∑\nk=1\nAmqk ·W′\nmx(pq + ∆pmqk)\n]\n, (2)\nwhere mindexes the attention head, k indexes the sampled keys, and K is the total sampled key\nnumber (K ≪HW). ∆pmqk and Amqk denote the sampling offset and attention weight of the\nkth sampling point in the mth attention head, respectively. The scalar attention weight Amqk lies\nin the range [0,1], normalized by ∑K\nk=1 Amqk = 1 . ∆pmqk ∈R2 are of 2-d real numbers with\nunconstrained range. As pq + ∆pmqk is fractional, bilinear interpolation is applied as in Dai et al.\n(2017) in computingx(pq+∆pmqk). Both ∆pmqk and Amqk are obtained via linear projection over\nthe query feature zq. In implementation, the query feature zq is fed to a linear projection operator\nof 3MK channels, where the ﬁrst 2MK channels encode the sampling offsets ∆pmqk, and the\nremaining MK channels are fed to a softmax operator to obtain the attention weights Amqk.\nThe deformable attention module is designed for processing convolutional feature maps as key ele-\nments. Let Nq be the number of query elements, whenMK is relatively small, the complexity of the\ndeformable attention module is of O(2NqC2 + min(HWC2,NqKC2)) (See Appendix A.1 for de-\ntails). When it is applied in DETR encoder, whereNq = HW, the complexity becomesO(HWC2),\nwhich is of linear complexity with the spatial size. When it is applied as the cross-attention modules\n5\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nin DETR decoder, where Nq = N (N is the number of object queries), the complexity becomes\nO(NKC2), which is irrelevant to the spatial size HW.\nMulti-scale Deformable Attention Module. Most modern object detection frameworks beneﬁt\nfrom multi-scale feature maps (Liu et al., 2020). Our proposed deformable attention module can be\nnaturally extended for multi-scale feature maps.\nLet {xl}L\nl=1 be the input multi-scale feature maps, where xl ∈RC×Hl×Wl . Let ˆpq ∈[0,1]2 be\nthe normalized coordinates of the reference point for each query element q, then the multi-scale\ndeformable attention module is applied as\nMSDeformAttn(zq,ˆpq,{xl}L\nl=1) =\nM∑\nm=1\nWm\n[ L∑\nl=1\nK∑\nk=1\nAmlqk ·W′\nmxl(φl( ˆpq) + ∆pmlqk)\n]\n, (3)\nwhere mindexes the attention head, l indexes the input feature level, and k indexes the sampling\npoint. ∆pmlqk and Amlqk denote the sampling offset and attention weight of the kth sampling point\nin the lth feature level and the mth attention head, respectively. The scalar attention weight Amlqk\nis normalized by ∑L\nl=1\n∑K\nk=1 Amlqk = 1. Here, we use normalized coordinates ˆpq ∈[0,1]2 for\nthe clarity of scale formulation, in which the normalized coordinates (0,0) and (1,1) indicate the\ntop-left and the bottom-right image corners, respectively. Function φl( ˆpq) in Equation 3 re-scales\nthe normalized coordinates ˆpq to the input feature map of the l-th level. The multi-scale deformable\nattention is very similar to the previous single-scale version, except that it samples LK points from\nmulti-scale feature maps instead of Kpoints from single-scale feature maps.\nThe proposed attention module will degenerate to deformable convolution (Dai et al., 2017), when\nL = 1 , K = 1 , and W′\nm ∈RCv×C is ﬁxed as an identity matrix. Deformable convolution is\ndesigned for single-scale inputs, focusing only on one sampling point for each attention head. How-\never, our multi-scale deformable attention looks over multiple sampling points from multi-scale in-\nputs. The proposed (multi-scale) deformable attention module can also be perceived as an efﬁcient\nvariant of Transformer attention, where a pre-ﬁltering mechanism is introduced by the deformable\nsampling locations. When the sampling points traverse all possible locations, the proposed attention\nmodule is equivalent to Transformer attention.\nDeformable Transformer Encoder. We replace the Transformer attention modules processing\nfeature maps in DETR with the proposed multi-scale deformable attention module. Both the input\nand output of the encoder are of multi-scale feature maps with the same resolutions. In encoder, we\nextract multi-scale feature maps{xl}L−1\nl=1 (L= 4) from the output feature maps of stagesC3 through\nC5 in ResNet (He et al., 2016) (transformed by a 1 ×1 convolution), where Cl is of resolution 2l\nlower than the input image. The lowest resolution feature map xL is obtained via a 3 ×3 stride 2\nconvolution on the ﬁnal C5 stage, denoted as C6. All the multi-scale feature maps are of C = 256\nchannels. Note that the top-down structure in FPN (Lin et al., 2017a) is not used, because our\nproposed multi-scale deformable attention in itself can exchange information among multi-scale\nfeature maps. The constructing of multi-scale feature maps are also illustrated in Appendix A.2.\nExperiments in Section 5.2 show that adding FPN will not improve the performance.\nIn application of the multi-scale deformable attention module in encoder, the output are of multi-\nscale feature maps with the same resolutions as the input. Both the key and query elements are\nof pixels from the multi-scale feature maps. For each query pixel, the reference point is itself. To\nidentify which feature level each query pixel lies in, we add a scale-level embedding, denoted asel,\nto the feature representation, in addition to the positional embedding. Different from the positional\nembedding with ﬁxed encodings, the scale-level embedding {el}L\nl=1 are randomly initialized and\njointly trained with the network.\nDeformable Transformer Decoder. There are cross-attention and self-attention modules in the\ndecoder. The query elements for both types of attention modules are of object queries. In the cross-\nattention modules, object queries extract features from the feature maps, where the key elements are\nof the output feature maps from the encoder. In the self-attention modules, object queries interact\nwith each other, where the key elements are of the object queries. Since our proposed deformable\nattention module is designed for processing convolutional feature maps as key elements, we only\nreplace each cross-attention module to be the multi-scale deformable attention module, while leaving\nthe self-attention modules unchanged. For each object query, the 2-d normalized coordinate of the\n6\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nreference point ˆpq is predicted from its object query embedding via a learnable linear projection\nfollowed by a sigmoid function.\nBecause the multi-scale deformable attention module extracts image features around the reference\npoint, we let the detection head predict the bounding box as relative offsets w.r.t. the reference\npoint to further reduce the optimization difﬁculty. The reference point is used as the initial guess\nof the box center. The detection head predicts the relative offsets w.r.t. the reference point. Check\nAppendix A.3 for the details. In this way, the learned decoder attention will have strong correlation\nwith the predicted bounding boxes, which also accelerates the training convergence.\nBy replacing Transformer attention modules with deformable attention modules in DETR, we es-\ntablish an efﬁcient and fast converging detection system, dubbed as Deformable DETR (see Fig. 1).\n4.2 A DDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AND VARIANTS FOR DEFORMABLE DETR\nDeformable DETR opens up possibilities for us to exploit various variants of end-to-end object de-\ntectors, thanks to its fast convergence, and computational and memory efﬁciency. Due to limited\nspace, we only introduce the core ideas of these improvements and variants here. The implementa-\ntion details are given in Appendix A.4.\nIterative Bounding Box Reﬁnement. This is inspired by the iterative reﬁnement developed in\noptical ﬂow estimation (Teed & Deng, 2020). We establish a simple and effective iterative bounding\nbox reﬁnement mechanism to improve detection performance. Here, each decoder layer reﬁnes the\nbounding boxes based on the predictions from the previous layer.\nTwo-Stage Deformable DETR. In the original DETR, object queries in the decoder are irrelevant\nto the current image. Inspired by two-stage object detectors, we explore a variant of Deformable\nDETR for generating region proposals as the ﬁrst stage. The generated region proposals will be fed\ninto the decoder as object queries for further reﬁnement, forming a two-stage Deformable DETR.\nIn the ﬁrst stage, to achieve high-recall proposals, each pixel in the multi-scale feature maps would\nserve as an object query. However, directly setting object queries as pixels will bring unacceptable\ncomputational and memory cost for the self-attention modules in the decoder, whose complexity\ngrows quadratically with the number of queries. To avoid this problem, we remove the decoder and\nform an encoder-only Deformable DETR for region proposal generation. In it, each pixel is assigned\nas an object query, which directly predicts a bounding box. Top scoring bounding boxes are picked\nas region proposals. No NMS is applied before feeding the region proposals to the second stage.\n5 E XPERIMENT\nDataset. We conduct experiments on COCO 2017 dataset (Lin et al., 2014). Our models are trained\non the train set, and evaluated on the val set and test-dev set.\nImplementation Details. ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) pre-trained ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016)\nis utilized as the backbone for ablations. Multi-scale feature maps are extracted without FPN (Lin\net al., 2017a). M = 8 and K = 4 are set for deformable attentions by default. Parameters of the\ndeformable Transformer encoder are shared among different feature levels. Other hyper-parameter\nsetting and training strategy mainly follow DETR (Carion et al., 2020), except that Focal Loss (Lin\net al., 2017b) with loss weight of 2 is used for bounding box classiﬁcation, and the number of\nobject queries is increased from 100 to 300. We also report the performance of DETR-DC5 with\nthese modiﬁcations for a fair comparison, denoted as DETR-DC5 +. By default, models are trained\nfor 50 epochs and the learning rate is decayed at the 40-th epoch by a factor of 0.1. Following\nDETR(Carion et al., 2020), we train our models using Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with\nbase learning rate of 2 ×10−4, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and weight decay of 10−4. Learning rates\nof the linear projections, used for predicting object query reference points and sampling offsets, are\nmultiplied by a factor of 0.1. Run time is evaluated on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU.\n5.1 C OMPARISON WITH DETR\nAs shown in Table 1, compared with Faster R-CNN + FPN, DETR requires many more training\nepochs to converge, and delivers lower performance at detecting small objects. Compared with\n7\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nDETR, Deformable DETR achieves better performance (especially on small objects) with 10×less\ntraining epochs. Detailed convergence curves are shown in Fig. 3. With the aid of iterative bounding\nbox reﬁnement and two-stage paradigm, our method can further improve the detection accuracy.\nOur proposed Deformable DETR has on par FLOPs with Faster R-CNN + FPN and DETR-DC5.\nBut the runtime speed is much faster (1.6 ×) than DETR-DC5, and is just 25% slower than Faster\nR-CNN + FPN. The speed issue of DETR-DC5 is mainly due to the large amount of memory access\nin Transformer attention. Our proposed deformable attention can mitigate this issue, at the cost of\nunordered memory access. Thus, it is still slightly slower than traditional convolution.\nTable 1: Comparision of Deformable DETR with DETR on COCO 2017 val set.

For\nDeformable DETR, we explore different training schedules by varying the epochs at which the\nlearning rate is reduced (where the AP score leaps).\n5.2 A BLATION STUDY ON DEFORMABLE ATTENTION\nTable 2 presents ablations for various design choices of the proposed deformable attention module.\nUsing multi-scale inputs instead of single-scale inputs can effectively improve detection accuracy\nwith 1.7% AP, especially on small objects with2.9% APS. Increasing the number of sampling points\nKcan further improve 0.9% AP. Using multi-scale deformable attention, which allows information\nexchange among different scale levels, can bring additional 1.5% improvement in AP. Because the\ncross-level feature exchange is already adopted, adding FPNs will not improve the performance.\nWhen multi-scale attention is not applied, andK = 1, our (multi-scale) deformable attention module\ndegenerates to deformable convolution, delivering noticeable lower accuracy.\n5.3 C OMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE -ART METHODS\nTable 3 compares the proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods. Iterative bounding box\nreﬁnement and two-stage mechanism are both utilized by our models in Table 3. With ResNet-101\nand ResNeXt-101 (Xie et al., 2017), our method achieves 48.7 AP and 49.0 AP without bells and\nwhistles, respectively. By using ResNeXt-101 with DCN (Zhu et al., 2019b), the accuracy rises to\n50.1 AP. With additional test-time augmentations, the proposed method achieves 52.3 AP.\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nTable 2: Ablations for deformable attention on COCO 2017 val set. “MS inputs” indicates us-\ning multi-scale inputs. “MS attention” indicates using multi-scale deformable attention.

Given the sampling coordinate offsets and attention weights, the complexity\nof computing Equation 2 is O(NqC2 + NqKC2 + 5NqKC), where the factor of 5 in 5NqKC\nis because of bilinear interpolation and the weighted sum in attention. On the other hand, we can\nalso calculate W′\nmx before sampling, as it is independent to query, and the complexity of computing\nEquation 2 will become asO(NqC2 +HWC2 +5NqKC). So the overall complexity of deformable\nattention is O(NqC2 + min(HWC2,NqKC2) + 5NqKC + 3NqCMK). In our experiments,\nM = 8 , K ≤ 4 and C = 256 by default, thus 5K + 3MK < C and the complexity is of\nO(2NqC2 + min(HWC2,NqKC2)).\nA.2 C ONSTRUCTING MULT-SCALE FEATURE MAPS FOR DEFORMABLE DETR\nAs discussed in Section 4.1 and illustrated in Figure 4, the input multi-scale feature maps of the\nencoder {xl}L−1\nl=1 (L = 4) are extracted from the output feature maps of stages C3 through C5 in\nResNet (He et al., 2016) (transformed by a1×1 convolution). The lowest resolution feature mapxL\nis obtained via a 3×3 stride 2 convolution on the ﬁnal C5 stage. Note that FPN (Lin et al., 2017a) is\nnot used, because our proposed multi-scale deformable attention in itself can exchange information\namong multi-scale feature maps.\n𝐻8 ×𝑊8 × 512\n𝐻16 ×𝑊16 × 1024\n𝐻32 ×𝑊32 × 2048\n𝐻8 ×𝑊8 × 256\n𝐻16 ×𝑊16 × 256\n𝐻32 ×𝑊32 × 256\n𝐻64 ×𝑊64 × 256\n𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣 1 × 1,𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑒 1\n𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣 1 × 1,𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑒 1\n𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣 1 × 1,𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑒 1\n𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣 3 × 3,𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑒 2\nInput Multi-scale Feature Maps{𝒙𝑙 }𝑙=1\n4\n𝑪3\n𝑪4\n𝑪5\nResNet Feature Maps\nFigure 4: Constructing mult-scale feature maps for Deformable DETR.\nA.3 B OUNDING BOX PREDICTION IN DEFORMABLE DETR\nSince the multi-scale deformable attention module extracts image features around the reference\npoint, we design the detection head to predict the bounding box as relative offsets w.r.t. the reference\npoint to further reduce the optimization difﬁculty. The reference point is used as the initial guess\nof the box center. The detection head predicts the relative offsets w.r.t. the reference point ˆpq =\n(ˆpqx,ˆpqy), i.e., ˆbq = {σ\n(\nbqx+σ−1(ˆpqx)\n)\n,σ\n(\nbqy +σ−1(ˆpqy)\n)\n,σ(bqw),σ(bqh)}, where bq{x,y,w,h}∈\nR are predicted by the detection head. σ and σ−1 denote the sigmoid and the inverse sigmoid\nfunction, respectively. The usage of σ and σ−1 is to ensure ˆb is of normalized coordinates, as\nˆbq ∈[0,1]4. In this way, the learned decoder attention will have strong correlation with the predicted\nbounding boxes, which also accelerates the training convergence.\nA.4 M ORE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nIterative Bounding Box Reﬁnement. Here, each decoder layer reﬁnes the bounding boxes based\non the predictions from the previous layer. Suppose there are D number of decoder layers (e.g.,\nD = 6), given a normalized bounding box ˆbd−1\nq predicted by the (d−1)-th decoder layer, the d-th\n12\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\ndecoder layer reﬁnes the box as\nˆbd\nq = {σ(∆bd\nqx+σ−1(ˆbd−1\nqx )),σ(∆bd\nqy+σ−1(ˆbd−1\nqy )),σ(∆bd\nqw+σ−1(ˆbd−1\nqw )),σ(∆bd\nqh+σ−1(ˆbd−1\nqh ))},\nwhere d ∈ {1,2,...,D }, ∆bd\nq{x,y,w,h} ∈ R are predicted at the d-th decoder layer. Prediction\nheads for different decoder layers do not share parameters. The initial box is set as ˆb0\nqx = ˆpqx,\nˆb0\nqy = ˆpqy, ˆb0\nqw = 0.1, and ˆb0\nqh = 0.1. The system is robust to the choice of b0\nqw and b0\nqh. We tried\nsetting them as 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and achieved similar performance. To stabilize training, similar\nto Teed & Deng (2020), the gradients only back propagate through∆bd\nq{x,y,w,h}, and are blocked at\nσ−1(ˆbd−1\nq{x,y,w,h}).\nIn iterative bounding box reﬁnement, for the d-th decoder layer, we sample key elements respective\nto the box ˆbd−1\nq predicted from the (d−1)-th decoder layer. For Equation 3 in the cross-attention\nmodule of the d-th decoder layer, (ˆbd−1\nqx ,ˆbd−1\nqy ) serves as the new reference point. The sampling\noffset ∆pmlqk is also modulated by the box size, as (∆pmlqkx ˆbd−1\nqw ,∆pmlqky ˆbd−1\nqh ). Such modiﬁ-\ncations make the sampling locations related to the center and size of previously predicted boxes.\nTwo-Stage Deformable DETR. In the ﬁrst stage, given the output feature maps of the encoder, a\ndetection head is applied to each pixel. The detection head is of a 3-layer FFN for bounding box\nregression, and a linear projection for bounding box binary classiﬁcation (i.e., foreground and back-\nground), respectively. Let iindex a pixel from feature level li ∈{1,2,...,L }with 2-d normalized\ncoordinates ˆpi = (ˆpix,ˆpiy) ∈[0,1]2, its corresponding bounding box is predicted by\nˆbi = {σ(∆bix+σ−1(ˆpix)),σ(∆biy+σ−1(ˆpiy)),σ(∆biw+σ−1(2li−1s)),σ(∆bih+σ−1(2li−1s))},\nwhere the base object scale sis set as 0.05, ∆bi{x,y,w,h} ∈R are predicted by the bounding box\nregression branch. The Hungarian loss in DETR is used for training the detection head.\nGiven the predicted bounding boxes in the ﬁrst stage, top scoring bounding boxes are picked as\nregion proposals. In the second stage, these region proposals are fed into the decoder as initial boxes\nfor the iterative bounding box reﬁnement, where the positional embeddings of object queries are set\nas positional embeddings of region proposal coordinates.\nInitialization for Multi-scale Deformable Attention. In our experiments, the number of at-\ntention heads is set as M = 8 . In multi-scale deformable attention modules, W′\nm ∈ RCv×C\nand Wm ∈ RC×Cv are randomly initialized. Weight parameters of the linear projection for\npredicting Amlqk and ∆pmlqk are initialized to zero. Bias parameters of the linear projection\nare initialized to make Amlqk = 1\nLK and {∆p1lqk = ( −k,−k),∆p2lqk = ( −k,0),∆p3lqk =\n(−k,k),∆p4lqk = (0 ,−k),∆p5lqk = (0 ,k),∆p6lqk = ( k,−k),∆p7lqk = ( k,0),∆p8lqk =\n(k,k)}(k∈{1,2,...K}) at initialization.\nFor iterative bounding box reﬁnement, the initialized bias parameters for ∆pmlqk prediction in the\ndecoder are further multiplied with 1\n2K , so that all the sampling points at initialization are within the\ncorresponding bounding boxes predicted from the previous decoder layer.\nA.5 W HAT DEFORMABLE DETR LOOKS AT ?\nFor studying what Deformable DETR looks at to give ﬁnal detection result, we draw the gradient\nnorm of each item in ﬁnal prediction (i.e., x/y coordinate of object center, width/height of object\nbounding box, category score of this object) with respect to each pixel in the image, as shown in\nFig. 5. According to Taylor’s theorem, the gradient norm can reﬂect how much the output would\nbe changed relative to the perturbation of the pixel, thus it could show us which pixels the model\nmainly relys on for predicting each item.\nThe visualization indicates that Deformable DETR looks at extreme points of the object to deter-\nmine its bounding box, which is similar to the observation in DETR (Carion et al., 2020). More con-\ncretely, Deformable DETR attends to left/right boundary of the object for x coordinate and width,\nand top/bottom boundary for y coordinate and height. Meanwhile, different to DETR (Carion et al.,\n2020), our Deformable DETR also looks at pixels inside the object for predicting its category.\n13\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n∥∂x\n∂I ∥\n∥∂y\n∂I ∥\n∥∂w\n∂I ∥\n∥∂h\n∂I ∥\n∥∂c\n∂I ∥\nFigure 5: The gradient norm of each item (coordinate of object center (x,y), width/height of object\nbounding box w/h, category score cof this object) in ﬁnal detection result with respect to each pixel\nin input image I.\nA.6 V ISUALIZATION OF MULTI -SCALE DEFORMABLE ATTENTION\nFor better understanding learned multi-scale deformable attention modules, we visualize sampling\npoints and attention weights of the last layer in encoder and decoder, as shown in Fig. 6. For\nreadibility, we combine the sampling points and attention weights from feature maps of different\nresolutions into one picture.\nSimilar to DETR (Carion et al., 2020), the instances are already separated in the encoder of De-\nformable DETR. While in the decoder, our model is focused on the whole foreground instance\ninstead of only extreme points as observed in DETR (Carion et al., 2020). Combined with the visu-\nalization of ∥∂c\n∂I ∥in Fig. 5, we can guess the reason is that our Deformable DETR needs not only\nextreme points but also interior points to detemine object category. The visualization also demon-\nstrates that the proposed multi-scale deformable attention module can adapt its sampling points and\nattention weights according to different scales and shapes of the foreground object.\n14\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nlow\nhigh\n(a) multi-scale deformable self-attention in encoder\nlow\nhigh\n(b) multi-scale deformable cross-attention in decoder\nFigure 6: Visualization of multi-scale deformable attention.

The\nreference point is shown as green cross marker, which is also equivalent to query point in encoder. In\ndecoder, the predicted bounding box is shown as a green rectangle and the category and conﬁdence\nscore are texted just above it.\n15\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nA.7 N OTATIONS\nTable 4: Lookup table for notations in the paper.\nNotation Description\nm index for attention head\nl index for feature level of key element\nq index for query element\nk index for key element\nNq number of query elements\nNk number of key elements\nM number of attention heads\nL number of input feature levels\nK number of sampled keys in each feature level for each attention head\nC input feature dimension\nCv feature dimension at each attention head\nH height of input feature map\nW width of input feature map\nHl height of input feature map of lth feature level\nWl width of input feature map of lth feature level\nAmqk attention weight of qth query to kth key at mth head\nAmlqk attention weight of qth query to kth key in lth feature level at mth head\nzq input feature of qth query\npq 2-d coordinate of reference point for qth query\nˆpq normalized 2-d coordinate of reference point for qth query\nx input feature map (input feature of key elements)\nxk input feature of kth key\nxl input feature map of lth feature level\n∆pmqk sampling offset of qth query to kth key at mth head\n∆pmlqk sampling offset of qth query to kth key in lth feature level at mth head\nWm output projection matrix at mth head\nUm input query projection matrix at mth head\nVm input key projection matrix at mth head\nW′\nm input value projection matrix at mth head\nφl( ˆp) unnormalized 2-d coordinate of ˆp in lth feature level\nexp exponential function\nσ sigmoid function\nσ−1 inverse sigmoid function\n16",
