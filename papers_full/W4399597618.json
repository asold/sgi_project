Users primarily\ninteract with VAs through voice commands, where users initiate a\nretrieval request by uttering a query.\nThe Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) component of the\nVA system transcribes the spoken user query, which is then sub-\nsequently processed by the retrieval engine. However, the ASR\nsystem is trained on audio/text pairs that are expensive and time-\nconsuming to obtain. During the recognition process, the ASR sys-\ntem employs a query prior trained solely on text to disambiguate\nbetween phonetically-similar recognition candidates. Hence, the\nquery prior is a powerful mechanism to modify the ASR system’s\nbehavior, and has been shown to be an effective manner to improve\nthe recognition of tail named entities [3, 8, 10, 14, 17].\nIn order to correctly recognize emerging entities [4], the ASR\nsystem’s query prior is estimated using a mixture of usage-based\nand synthetic text data. Synthetic queries are typically generated\nusing a template-based approach [2, 13]. A query template, such\nas “play music by $ARTIST” , representing the generic intent of a\nuser wanting to play music by a specific artist, is instantiated using\na popularity-weighted list of entities. However, template-based\napproaches are stringent, may only represent a limited set of use-\ncases, and are not well-suited to generate synthetic queries for use-\ncases that are specific to particular entities. For example, the query\n“play Taylor Swift’s debut performance at the Grammy’s” represents\nthe user’s intent to play the song “Fifteen” by Taylor Swift which\nwas Swift’s debut performance at the Grammy’s in 2009. While\ncreating a template based on this query would be possible, it does\nnot generalize across entities: some entities may not have performed\nat the Grammy’s and finding the relevant venue would require\nmanual curation. Hence, synthetic query generation methods that\ncan generate queries tailored to specific entities are necessary.\nRecent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) have shown\nimpressive improvements in language understanding tasks [ 5]\nthrough their emergent capabilities [ 16]. In IR, there have been\nvarious works focusing on the generation of queries using LLMs\n[1, 11, 15].\nIn this paper, we perform a preliminary analysis of the use of\nLLMs to produce query priors in VA ASR. We generate synthetic\nqueries by prompting LLMs using a description of the artist gath-\nered from Wikipedia. Then, we evaluate the generated queries in\narXiv:2406.06729v1  [cs.IR]  10 Jun 2024\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Sonal Sannigrahi, Thiago Fraga-Silva, Youssef Oualil, and Christophe Van Gysel\nFigure 1: Proposed pipeline to generate queries for a VA via an LLM.\nterms of their similarity to randomly sampled, representative, and\nanonymized user queries from a popular VA, in addition to the\nqueries’ ability to retrieve the entity for which they were gener-\nated. More specifically, the research questions addressed are as\nfollows: (RQ1) Can LLMs generate VA queries that are similar to\nuser queries extracted from VA query logs (i.e., domain match)?\n(RQ2) Are the LLM-generated queries good at retrieving the entity\nfor which they were generated (i.e., specificity)?\nOur contributions are as follows: (1) We propose a prompt for\nLLMs to produce natural queries for the music domain for VAs,\nand perform extensive experiments comparing the LLM-generated\nqueries to queries generated using template-based methods, (2) We\nprovide insights through analysis into the differences between\nqueries generated using the various methods.\n2 METHODOLOGY\nFig. 1 shows an overview of our approach, which consists of the\nfollowing three main components: (1) entity descriptions extracted\nfrom Wikipedia to provide context for synthetic query generation,\n(2) the prompt which incorporates the entity description and for-\nmulates a request to the LLM to generate synthetic data, where we\nalso specify the intent the queries need to represent, and (3) the\nLLM, which takes the prompt as input and subsequently generates\na list of synthetic queries as output.\n2.1 Knowledge Base\nWe build our music artist knowledge base by linking Wikipedia data\nwith artist profiles on a popular streaming service. The paragraphs\nin the Wikipedia articles are used as contexts to generate synthetic\nqueries using LLMs (§2.2). The combination of the Wikipedia arti-\ncle, and the artist profile retrieved from the streaming service, are\nused to build a search engine to evaluate the end-to-end perfor-\nmance of the generated queries (§4.2). We obtained a catalog of mu-\nsic artist entities by downloading the list of most popular artists on\na streaming service in July 2023 and linking them to their respective\nWikipedia profile using property P2850 (i.e., “Artist ID Number” )\nthrough Wikidata’s SPARQL query service1. We also use theMusic-\nGroup2 metadata object, embedded in the source of each artist page\non music.apple.com, with entries that include artist name, biogra-\nphy, an unique artist ID, as well as discography information. Be-\ntween both the Wikipedia dumps and the artist database, we main-\ntain a direct linking to produce a knowledge base of 14 161 artists.\n2.2 Prompt & LLMs\nOur prompt is depicted in Fig. 2. For each entity in the knowl-\nedge base (§2.1), we create prompts by populating the artist name\n1https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service\n2https://schema.org/MusicGroup\n[ ARTIST DESCRIPTION ]\nGenerate [K] queries based on the information\nabove about [ ARTIST NAME ] to play music or learn\nmore about [ ARTIST NAME ].\nHere are some examples : [ EXAMPLES ]\nFigure 2: LLM prompt used during our experiments. [ARTIST\nDESCRIPTION] and [ARTIST NAME] are replaced with an entity descrip-\ntion, and the entity name, resp. [EXAMPLES] are a list of example VA\nqueries for the specific intent. We fix [EXAMPLES] to the following\n\"play, queue, turn on, etc\". [K] is the number of queries.\nand use the lead section (i.e., the introduction) as their descrip-\ntion. For music artists, the lead section typically references no-\ntable audiography, collaborations and life events. The number of\nqueries, 𝐾, is set to 40 (§3.1) in this paper. We use the OpenAI API\nto generate queries with four model variants3. More specifically, we\nexperiment with babbage-002, gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo-\ninstruct, and gpt-4 (see §3.1 for details).\n3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n3.1 Query generation methods under\ncomparison\nWe generate queries for all 14 161 entities from our knowledge\nbase (§2.1) using (a) the entity name by itself, (b) a template-based\napproach using the top-𝐾 (according to prior probability) music\nquery templates released as part of [13] (excluding the templates\nthat consist of only the entity name by itself in order to differen-\ntiate from approach (a)), and (c) four different LLMs available via\nOpenAI’s API using the prompt in Fig. 2 (§2.2) where we ask the\nLLM to generate 𝐾 queries: babbage-002, gpt-3.5-turbo (v0613),\ngpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, and gpt-4; with 𝐾 = 40. During our\nexperiments, we report evaluation measures at various values of\n𝐾 ≤40, in which case we extract the first 𝐾 queries from the list of\n40 queries (rather than issuing multiple requests to the LLM with\nvarying 𝐾). Generated queries that start with a VA wakeword (e.g.,\n“hey V A”where V Arefers to the name of the assistant), have the pre-\nfix corresponding to the wakeword removed. For example, a query\n“hey VA play Moderat” is normalized to “play Moderat” . This step\naims at avoiding biases towards methods that frequently generate\nthe wakeword during domain match evaluation (§4.1).\n3.2 Evaluation measures\nTo answerRQ1, we measure the likelihood of the generated queries\nunder a 4-gram back-off language model [6] estimated on randomly\nsampled and anonymized user queries over a span of 2 years from\na popular VA. We apply Good Turing smoothing, and N-grams\n3https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview\nSynthetic Query Generation using Large Language Models for Virtual Assistants SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\nentity name templates babbage-002 gpt-3.5-turbo gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct gpt-4\n# entities 14161 14161 13848 14161 14156 14161\n# unique queries per entity 1.00 ±0.00 39 .51 ±0.50 9 .64 ±14.74 41 .60 ±3.61 40 .09 ±2.27 39 .99 ±0.13\nquery length per entity 1.58 ±0.80 3 .78 ±1.24 52 .30 ±122.05 8 .11 ±2.66 8 .42 ±4.03 8 .31 ±2.47\n% of queries with > 15 terms 0.01% 0.01% 40.85% 1.17% 1.44% 1.16%\nTable 1: Statistics of generated queries across the approaches under consideration (§3.1).\nthat occur infrequently (less than 3 times) in the data are filtered\nout. The negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a single query 𝑞 with\n|𝑞|terms is defined as NLL (𝑞)= −\n\u0010Í|𝑞|\n𝑖=1 log 𝑃(𝑞𝑖 |𝑞1 ...𝑞 𝑖−1)\n\u0011\n,\nwhere 𝑃(𝑞𝑖 |𝑞1 ...𝑞 𝑖−1)represents the probability of the term 𝑞𝑖\nunder the 4-gram LM. Using a 4-gram LM, rather than looking for\nexact matches in query logs, provides us with a flexible approach to\nscore the likelihood of a query, while also having the ability to assign\na score to queries not present in the query logs. The lower the NLL,\nthe more a query is likely under VA user query behavior. We report\nmedian NLL across a query set of the first 𝐾 queries for each entity.\nFor RQ2, we measure to what capacity the generated queries\ncan retrieve the entity for which they were generated in order to\nmeasure query specificity. We build an index of our knowledge base\n14 161 entities where each entity is represented by its Wikipedia\npage and its profile on a music streaming service (§2.1), including\nbiography and most popular discography. Both indexed documents\nand queries are pre-processed by lower-casing, removing punctua-\ntion and non-alphanumeric characters, removing stopwords, and\napplying a Porter stemmer. We use the BM25-L retrieval model [12,\n§3.2] with 𝑘1 = 1.5, 𝑏 = 0.75 and 𝛿 = 0.5. Since for each query, there\nis only one relevant entity, we report reciprocal rank (RR), aver-\naged over the top-𝐾 queries 𝑞and entities 𝑒, with RR defined as\nRR (𝑞,𝑒)= 1\nrank (𝑞,𝑒)\nwhere rank (𝑞,𝑒)equals the rank of the entity 𝑒 for which query 𝑞\nwas generated under the BM25-L retrieval model. The higher the\nRR, the better a query is able to retrieve the entity it was generated\nfor (and, hence, the more specific an entity is). We report mean RR\nacross a query set for the first 𝐾 queries generated for each entity.\n4 RESULTS\nTable 1 shows statistics on the generated queries using the vari-\nous methods (§3.1). In Fig. 3a, we see that while the standalone\nentity-name and template-based methods generate relatively short\nqueries (1–4 terms), the LLM-based methods tend to be more ver-\nbose (∼8 terms). A sample of generated queries for entity Post Mal-\none (Q21621919) is depicted in Table 2. The babbage-002 LLM, a\nGPT base model not trained with instruction following [ 7], per-\nforms poorly and fails to generate reasonable queries. As expected,\nthe template-based approach generates queries that are stylistically\nsimple, since the template is independent from the entity for which\nthe queries are being generated. On the other hand, queries gener-\nated by LLM-based methods are able to refer to information present\nin the artist description that was fed as context to the LLM. We will\nnow answer the research questions raised in §1 and further defined\nin §3.2.\nMethod Sample of generated queries\nentity name “Post Malone”\ntemplates\n“play Post Malone” , “play the song Post Malone” ,\n“play Post Malone music”\nbabbage-002 “Start with CTRL + M” , ...\ngpt-3.5\n“play White Iverson by Post Malone” ,\n“queue Congratulations by Post Malone” ,\n“turn on Post Malone’s album Beerbongs & Bentleys”\ngpt-3.5\n(instruct)\n“play Post Malone’s debut single White Iverson” ,\n“play Post Malone’s hit song Rockstar” ,\n“play Post Malone’s song Sunflower from the\nSpider-Man Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack”\ngpt-4\n“play White Iverson by Post Malone” ,\n“add Rockstar by Post Malone to my playlist” ,\n“turn up the volume for Psycho by Post Malone”\nTable 2: Example of queries generated by the various methods (§3.1).\n4.1 Similarity to VA usage queries\nFor RQ1, Fig. 3b shows the negative log likelihood (§3.1) for the\nmethods under consideration. The entity name by itself aligns\nclosest with user behavior, while the template-based approach is\na close second. This is not surprising, since the templates we used\nwere created by domain experts by analyzing high-frequency use-\ncases in a representative sample of VA usage [13, §3.1]. Hence, the\nentity name and template method represent frequent use-cases\nat the head of the query distribution.\nNext up, at approximately half the log-likelihood, queries gener-\nated by the LLMs seem to represent infrequent, tail use-cases. While\nnot entirely absent from VA usage, they are not as common as the\nstraight-forward templates. This is explained by the fact that the\nLLM-generated queries often reference specific songs or albums by\nthe artist—extracted from the artist’s description—resulting in less\ngeneric queries. However, this lack of generality yields queries that\nreference multiple entities and, hence, tend to be at most as—and\noften, significantly less—likely as queries referencing only a single\nentity. Note that in our prompt (Fig. 2), we did not instruct the LLMs\nto exhibit this behavior. We answerRQ1 as follows: queries gener-\nated by LLMs trained with instruction following correlate with VA\nuser behavior, although they tend to be more specific than queries\ngenerated using template-based approaches. This raises the ques-\ntion whether template- and LLM-based approaches are complemen-\ntary when it comes to synthetic query generation. In fact, compar-\ning the query sets generated by the template-based method and\ngpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, the mean/std. dev of the Jaccard coef-\nficient across entities equals 0.0038 ±0.0084, indicating very low\noverlap, and hence, complementarity.\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Sonal Sannigrahi, Thiago Fraga-Silva, Youssef Oualil, and Christophe Van Gysel\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n0\n100000\n200000 entity name\ntemplates\nbabbage-002\ngpt-3.5-turbo\ngpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\ngpt-4\n(a) Distribution of generated query lengths across the approaches under consideration (§3.1).

See Fig. 3a for the legend.\nFigure 3\n4.2 Query specificity\nFor RQ2, Fig. 3c depicts the reciprocal rank for the various meth-\nods (§3.1) at various cut-offs of the list of generated queries. The\nentity name method performs best, since it does not contain any\nsuperfluous terms and matches directly the specific entity mention\ncontained within the entity’s textual representation. Thetemplate-\nbased method performs nearly as well as the entity name method,\nsince it generates queries that contain the entity name padded with\ncarrier terms that are non-specific to the entity (e.g.,“play”, “song”).\nThe LLM-based methods score slightly worse than the entiy name\nand template methods, since the queries generated using LLMs are\nmore verbose and can include terms that match non-relevant enti-\nties. For example, song titles often consist of generic, non-specific\nterms and multiple songs can have the same title. Between the LLM-\nbased generated query collections, gpt-4 performs worst. When\nexamining the effect of query cut-off (𝐾), we see that as𝐾increases,\nRR generally decreases. This is due to the fact that, as 𝐾 increases,\nqueries become more complex and can contain terms that con-\nfuse the retrieval model. We answer RQ2 as follows: entity-centric\nqueries generated by LLMs achieve an average reciprocal rank of\n0.70; indicating that the correct entity is often ranked highly. How-\never, since LLMs generate more verbose queries, there are more\nterms in the queries that can throw off the retrieval model.\n4.3 Complementarity\nFinally, following the conclusions to RQ1 and RQ2 above, and the\nqualitative examples in Table 2, we find that template- and LLM-\nbased methods are complementary as follows: (1) template-based\nmethods allow to generate synthetic queries for frequent use-cases\n(e.g., for tail entities) that apply across all entities (e.g., “play mu-\nsic by $ARTIST” ) and are computationally inexpensive, whereas\n(2) LLM-based methods can generate specialized/infrequent use–\ncases (e.g., for popular/controversial entities) specific to the entity\nin question (e.g., “play Taylor Swift’s duet with Ed Sheeran” )—while\nhaving a higher computational cost. Hence, template- and LLM-\nbased methods can be combined to build a richer synthetic query col-\nlection with coverage for both (a) tail entities, and (b) tail use-cases.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we performed a preliminary analysis of the use of LLM-\nbased approaches for the generation of synthetic queries for training\na query prior used within a VA speech recognition system. We find\nthat template- and LLM-based approaches are complementary since\n(a) template-based methods can generate queries for frequent use-\ncases and infrequent entities, and (b) LLM-based methods are better\nsuited to target infrequent use-cases tailored to a specific entity. One\nlimitation of this work is that we relied on OpenAI’s API for LLMs.\nHowever, we did not observe any significant differences in behavior\nbetween the LLMs we experimented with, and we believe that the\noverall conclusion that template- and LLM-based query generation\nmethods are complementary will remain valid. Another limitation\nis that the LLM training data can bias the generated query priors,\nhowever addressing this is out of the scope of the current work.\nFuture work includes approaches to mix together the results of the\nmultiple query generation methods, such that the final collection\naligns with user behavior; in addition to exploration of the prompt\nused to query the LLM, use of more advanced prompting techniques\n(e.g., chain of thought), and LLM fine-tuning.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Manos Tsagkias, Lyan Verwimp,\nRuss Web, Sameer Badaskar, and the anonymous reviewers for their\ncomments and feedback.\nSynthetic Query Generation using Large Language Models for Virtual Assistants SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\nSPEAKER BIOGRAPHY\nSonal Sannigrahi is a PhD student at Instituto Superior Técnico\nin Lisbon, Portugal working on multi-modal Natural Language\nProcessing.
