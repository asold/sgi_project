    "abstract": "Abstract\\n The initial state development of breakdown is explained on the basis of bubble theory. Application of dc voltage to electrodes immersed in oil results in the creation of small channels. In the next phase an arc channel between the electrodes is formed. Resistance of the plasma channel changes from a few ohms to a few hundreds m? due to Joule heating caused by high arc currents which flows through this channel. The dynamics of the arc current depends on the parameters of the outer circuit and is \\nrepresented by the RLC circuit.",
