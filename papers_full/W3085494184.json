  "abstract": "The paper describes the use of a single-phase three-stage solid-state transformer in networks with non-sinusoidal voltages in order to improve the quality of electricity. An active-inductive load was chosen as the load. The solid-state transformer was simulated by the Matlab/Simulink software. Its performance was analyzed and the parameters for optimal performance were specified. The voltage and current graphs on the load and their spectral analysis are given. Total harmonic distortion was evaluated for current and voltage. As a comparison, the operation of a classic transformer was simulated. Modeling shows that solid-state transformer copes with improving the quality of electricity better than a classical transformer. In addition to improving the quality of the load current, the solid-state transformer protects the consumer from overvoltage, voltage dips, and other transient phenomena, due to the accumulated supply of electricity in the capacitors of the DC-Bus.",
