    "abstract": "Abstract When we look at the global knowledge graph landscape, we quickly find that there are billions of interconnected facts that have the potential to answer all kinds of questions. However, a persistent challenge lies in finding corresponding questions that align with these facts. The availability of these questions along with matching SPARQL queries is an important prerequisite for fine-tuning Large Language Models for domain-specific query generation, which is why we propose Queryfy , a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models to automate the task of deriving questions and queries from knowledge graphs, empowering users to harness their full potential.",
