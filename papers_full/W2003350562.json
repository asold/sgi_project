I NTRODUCTION\nHigh voltage pulse transformers are widely used in klystron\nmodulators. For these topologies, the quality of the modulator\noutput voltage is strongly dependent on the pulse transformer\nperformance. An optimal design process is a necessity, par-\nticularly when the speciﬁcations of the output voltage are\ntight such as in the case of the CLIC klystron modulator\nunder study at CERN [1]. With these new speciﬁcations\nfar above the present state of the art, the feasibility of the\nmonolithic pulse transformer based modulator topology needs\nthe development of a speciﬁc and accurate design methodology\nof High Power & High V oltage Pulse Transformers. This\npaper presents the development of a CAD environment that\nis using a dimensioning model based on 2D Finite Element\nAnalysis (FEA) only and a non-linear optimization procedure.\nFor each iteration of the non-linear optimization process, the\ntransformer parameters used to compute the objective and\nconstraints functions are directly derived from the 2D FEA\ndimensioning model.\nII. H IGH VOLTAGE PULSE TRANSFORMERS IN KLYSTRON\nMODULATORS\nA. Modulator topology using monolithic pulse transformer\nFig. 1 presents the structure of a solid state klystron modu-\nlator using a monolithic pulse transformer based topology. It is\ncomposed of a capacitive storage charger and a pulse forming\nsystem. The main capacitor bank is charged at 10kV by the\ncapacitor charger power converter.\nA high voltage fully controllable solid state switch (made of\nIGBT or IGCT stacks) is used to apply the capacitor voltage\nCAPACITOR CHARGER\nPULSE\nTRANSFORMER\n(PT)\nCAP.

Monolithic pulse transformer based topology\nto a pulse transformer that rises up the voltage to get a 150kV\noutput voltage pulse. At the end of the pulse, the main switch\nis opened and the core magnetizing energy is absorbed by\nan undershoot network. The bouncer is used to compensate\nthe discharge droop of the main capacitor bank during the\npulse. It can be passive (realized with reactive components)\nor active (realized with an auxiliary power converter) [2] [1].\nA fast solid state crowbar is also placed in parallel with the\ncapacitor bank to provide emergency fast discharge capability.\nB. High Voltage Pulse Transformer Structure\nThe HV (High V oltage) pulse transformer is immersed in\nan oil tank. Its core is made of high grade laminated material.\nSeveral winding conﬁgurations can be adopted [4], but the\nconventional topology is presented in Fig. 2. Two primary\nwindings P1 and P2 are placed on each core leg and con-\nnected in parallel. With the usual transformer speciﬁcations,\neach section can be realized with only one single layer of\nconductors. The secondary HV winding is composed of two\nsections SHV and SLV wound above the primary windings on\neach core leg and connected in series.\nBoth secondary sections are using a disc winding conﬁg-\nuration with several horizontal discs spaced along the axial\nlength of the core leg. In each disc, turns are wound in a radial\ndirection, with one turn per layer. With such a conﬁguration,\nadditional insulation between layers is minimized. The use\nof a single layer winding on the primary side and a disc\nwinding on the secondary side usually leads to a minimization\nFig. 2. Simpliﬁed Structure of Oil Immersed High V oltage Pulse Transformer\nin its Tank (Primary Windings in blue, Secondary windings in red)\nof the inter-turn winding capacitance. Along each core leg, the\nspace between the primary and secondary coils can be constant\nor adapted to try to operate the transformer with a constant\nvoltage gradient between them by use of conical shape of\nthe secondary windings in order to minimize the leakage\ninductance [5]. The core is also equipped with an auxiliary\nwinding supplied by a DC current source associated to an\nexternal inductor to provide a pre-magnetization of the core\nwith a negative ﬂux density before application of the voltage\npulse to the primary windings. With such an arrangement, a\nbipolar magnetic ﬂux excursion ∆B = 2 Bs (where Bs is\nthe saturation ﬂux density of the core magnetic material) is\nobtained when the unipolar voltage pulse is applied to the\nprimary windings and the pulse transformer core mass and\nvolume can be minimized [4].\nThe grounding connections of the transformer core, tank\nand windings are presented on Fig. 3.\nC. HV Pulse Transformer Equivalent Circuit\nBecause the modulator monolithic transformer is supplied\nwith a high voltage and operated in pulsed mode, the dis-\ntributed capacitances between the primary and secondary\nwindings, between the windings and the grounded core and\ntank cannot be neglected. They have a high inﬂuence on the\ndynamic characteristics of the output voltage pulse, according\nto the pulse length and the modulator instantaneous pulse\npower.

Electrical Equivalent Circuit of High V oltage Pulse Transformer\nunder study, the lumped-parameter equivalent circuit of Fig. 4\ncan be adopted to model a transformer with distributed capac-\nitance. The distribution of the magnetic energy stored in the\ntransformer is represented by a magnetizing inductance and\ntwo leakage inductances.\nWith such an assumption, the propagation phenomenon is\nneglected and the electromagnetic model can be decoupled in\nan electrostatic model and a magnetostatic model [5] [6]. If a\nlinear-distributed voltage in windings is assumed, it is possible\nto establish a dimensioning model of the different components\nof the electrical equivalent circuit (see Fig. 5). Transformer\ncapacitances and inductances can be respectively derived from\nthe computation of the electric and magnetic energy stored in\ndifferent regions of the device [5].\nFor practical presentation purpose, the following ﬁgures\npresent the electrical equivalent circuit of a non-inverting\ntransformer only; the case of an inverting transformer is similar\nin terms of circuit structure.\nIII.

High V oltage Pulse Transformer Generic Dimensioning Model\nare an important issue in terms of dynamical specs, droop,\nefﬁciency, power to volume and power to mass ratios, long\nterm reliability and cost [1]. With the required pulse width\nand repetition rate, the minimization of the total power con-\nsumption highly depends on the rise and fall times of the\noutput voltage pulse. The output voltage pulse quality is\nstrongly dependent on pulse transformer leakage inductances\n& parasitic capacitances that must be controlled during the\ndesign process. An accurate dimensioning model and an\noptimal design process of such transformers are required.\nB. HV Pulse Transformer Generic Dimensioning Model\nThe transformer dimensioning model can be derived from\nthe electrical equivalent circuit and the determination of its\ncomponents in terms of dimensions and material data. A\ngeneric dimensioning model of the monolithic HV pulse\ntransformer is presented on Fig. 6. It includes the preceding\nelectromagnetic dimensioning model, a simpliﬁed thermal\nmodeling tool and a simple mechanical modeling tool used\nto evaluate the structural behavior of the transformer operated\nin pulsed mode. The output voltage pulse is determined\nby simulation of the modulator electrical modeling that is\nincluding a transformer equivalent circuit derived from the\nelectromagnetic dimensioning model.\nTransformer \nDimensions \nMaterials \nData \nFixed Power \nSwitches \n \nOutput Voltage \nPulse simulation  \nDimensioning Model using 2D FEA \n2D FEA  \nIdentification \nEquivalent Circuit  \nThermal  \nModelling \nMechanical  \nModelling \nKlystron Rated \nOperation Point \nUser Input \nOutput \n \nModulator \nPerformance \nEvaluation \n \nUser \nInput \nFig. 7.

O PTIMAL DESIGN OF HIGH VOLTAGE PULSE\nTRANSFORMER USING 2D F INITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS\nIn the case of high voltage transformers, it is difﬁcult to\nobtain an analytical electromagnetic dimensioning model that\nis sufﬁciently accurate to perform an optimal design of the\ntransformer in terms of dynamical performances. In a previous\ndesign approach developed by the authors, ﬁeld computation\ntechniques based on 2D FEA have been already implemented\nin the CAD environment to validate or correct the analytical\nelectromagnetic dimensioning model [5]. In this paper a new\nefﬁcient optimal design methodology is presented that is using\na direct 2D FEA electromagnetic dimensioning model during\nthe transformer optimization process. The dimensioning model\nbased on 2D FEA only is presented on Fig. 7.\nThe simulated experiment concept has been applied to per-\nform direct FEA identiﬁcation tests of the electrical equivalent\ncircuit components. With such an approach, no simpliﬁed\nanalytical expressions of the inductances and capacitances are\nused.\nA. 2D FEA identiﬁcation of transformer inductances\nTwo FEA identiﬁcation tests based on magnetostatic ﬁeld\ncomputations are performed for the determination of the\nmagnetizing & leakage inductances:\n• Open Secondary FEA test: the magnetizing inductance\nis derived from the FEA computation of the magnetic\nenergy stored during transformer no-load operation.\n• Short-circuit FEA test: the total leakage inductance is\nderived from the FEA computation of the magnetic\nenergy stored during transformer short-circuit operation.\nB. 2D FEA identiﬁcation of transformer capacitances\n2D Electrostatic ﬁeld computations have been performed to\nidentify the three lumped capacitors of the electrical equivalent\ncircuit of Fig. 4. The three lumped capacitors C1, C2 & C12\ncan be derived from the electrostatic FEA simulations of\nthree different tests presented in Fig. 8: (a) Secondary short\ncircuited & grounded, (b) Primary short circuited & grounded,\n(c) Primary & secondary with V2n linear voltage distribution.\nOne can compute the three capacitances from the three values\nLmRm\na=n1/n2\nl11\nR2R1\nC11 C22\nC12\nl12\nV2=0\nV1=V1n\nV1n\nLmRm\na=n1/n2\nl11\nR2R1\nC11 C22\nC12\nl12\nV2=V2n\nV1=0\nV2n\nLmRm\na=n1/n2\nl11\nR2R1\nC11 C22\nC12\nl12\nV2=V2n\nV1=V1n\nV1n-V2n\nFig. 8.

The identiﬁed\nparameters derived from 2D FEA are used to compute the ob-\njective and constraints functions of the non-linear optimization\nprocedure to deliver the optimal transformer design.

E XAMPLE OF PULSE TRANSFORMER OPTIMIZATION\nThe proposed methodology has been applied to investigate\nthe preliminary design of the pulse transformer for the CLIC\nklystron modulator under study at CERN [1][3]. The Compact\nLinear Collider (CLIC) will need 300MW of average power\nfeeding 1638 klystron modulators with tight dynamical speciﬁ-\ncations in terms of rise time for a relatively long ﬂat-top width\n(Fig. 11) and high efﬁciency for minimizing the total power\nconsumption of the accelerator complex. The modulators will\nbe operated at 150kV/160A (24MW) in pulsed mode.\nA.

Two transformer conﬁgurations have been optimized: one\nconﬁguration with a constant space between the primary and\nsecondary coils, one conﬁguration with a conical shape of the\nsecondary windings. The optimization procedure was operated\nin multistart mode to avoid the convergence on local minima\nof the objective function in the space of solutions bounded\nby the constraints. The feasibility of the CLIC monolithic\npulse transformer with the the imposed speciﬁcations has\nbeen demonstrated. All the constraints including the voltage\nrise time and voltage overshoot speciﬁcations are respected\nfor the optimal solutions found for both conﬁgurations under\nstudy. The optimal transformer weights are listed on Table III.\nThe conical winding conﬁguration complicates the transformer\nTABLE I\nSPECIFICATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS OF CLIC PULSE TRANSFORMER\nOPTIMAL DESIGN\nPulse speciﬁcation Value Unit\nPeak output power 24 MW\nPrimary nominal voltage V1n 15 kV\nSecondary nominal voltage V2n 150 kV\nPulse length tp 140 µs\nV oltage pulse rise time trise < 5 µs\nV oltage pulse overshoot < 5% -\nPulse repetition rate 1\nTrep\n50 Hz\nMaterial speciﬁcations Value Unit\nBreakdown ﬁeld of insulating material 9 MV/m\nRelative permittivity of insulating material 3 -\nRelative permeability of magnetic material 4000 -\nSaturation ﬂux density of magnetic material 1.15 T\nConstraint Value unit\nCopper losses < 3% -\nMax. overall dimensions 1 x 0.5 x 1.2 m\nTABLE II\nCHARACTERISTICS OF OPTIMAL CLIC TRANSFORMER CONFIGURATION\nWITH CONSTANT SPACE BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY COILS .\nCharacteristic 2D FEA 3D FEA Unit Difference [%]\nMagnetizing inductance Lm 0.148 0.151 H -2%\nLeakage inductance l11 + a2l12 21.3 24.2 µH -14%\nPrimary capacitance C11 2.43 2.55 nF -5%\nSecondary capacitance C22 1080 775 pF 28%\nInter-windings capacitance C12 907 629 pF 31%\nV oltage pulse rise time 5 5.15 µs 3%\nV oltage pulse overshoot 0 0 % 0%\nproduction process but it does not signiﬁcatively increase the\nperformance.\nB. Validation of the optimal design by 3D FEA simulation\nThe optimal solution of the ﬁrst transformer conﬁguration\nwas simulated with a 3D Finite Element Analysis code to\nfurther investigate the inﬂuence of the 2D FEA assumptions\nused in the proposed design methodology. The results of the\n2D and 3D FEA simulations in terms of equivalent circuit\nparameters and voltage pulse characteristics can be compared\nin Table II. One can notice that the difference on the pulse rise\ntime and overshoot are 3% and 0% only. This is an important\nresult for the validation of the use of the 2D assumption in\nthe proposed transformer optimization process because time\nconsuming 3D FEA simulations are not well adapted to an\niterative process. The error on the rise time is low despite the\nfact that the most important errors related to the 2D assumption\noccur on the capacitance values. The rise time depends on both\ncapacitance and inductance values and in the the absence of\novershoot imposed by the speciﬁcations constraints, the errors\non the inductance and capacitance values partially compensate\neach other in the computation of the rise time. Both 3D and\n2D models are then in accordance when no pulse overshoot\nis allowed.\nThe induction spatial distribution plot for short circuit op-\neration (Fig. 12) and the electric ﬁeld spatial distribution plot\nfor the test V1 = 0 and V2 = 150kV (Fig. 13) with 2D FEA\nand 3D FEA can be compared.

The differences between 2D\nand 3D FEA mainly occur in the windings corners where one\ncan see that the magnetic ﬁeld is more homogeneous than the\nelectrostatic ﬁeld. Consequently the error on the capacitances\nis bigger than the error on the leakage inductance. There is no\nsigniﬁcative difference between 2D and 3D approach for the\nmagnetizing inductance estimation because only a negligible\namount ot magnetizing energy is stored outside the core under\nno-load operation .\nTABLE III\nCHARACTERISTICS OF OPTIMAL CLIC TRANSFORMER CONFIGURATIONS .\nCharacteristic Constant space windings Conical shape windings Unit\nWeight 264 255 Kg\nDimensions 0.407 x 0.225 x 0.678 0.372 x 0.240 x 0.663 m\nVI. C ONCLUSION\nAn efﬁcient optimal design methodology of monolithic\nhigh voltage pulse transformers based on the direct 2D FEA\nidentiﬁcation of the electrical equivalent circuit parameters has\nbeen presented. It can be used for a wide range of pulse\ntransformer applications.
