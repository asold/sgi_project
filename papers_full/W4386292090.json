However, further research is needed to investigate\nits use and effectiveness in diverse contexts.\nKeywords: artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, foreign language learning, writing skills, language\neducation for refugees/migrants\n1 Introduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI), according to McCarthy’s definition (McCarthy, 2007), is often\nreferred to as the “father of AI”, which is the science and engineering of making intelligent\nmachines brilliant computer programs (Karakose et al., 2023). It is related to the similar task\nof using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to\nbiologically observable methods (p.2). The beginning of the conversation on AI was marked in\n1950 by Alan Turing’s seminal work “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, by setting the\nquestion, “Can machines think?” (Turing, 1950). Since then, he has been offering a test known\nas the “Turing Test”, a method for determining whether a computer has intelligence. Depending\non the tasks an AI system is designed and trained to complete, it can be categorized as either\nWeak AI or Strong AI (What is Strong AI? IBM. 2023). The first category includes systems that\ncan perform a specific task, such as virtual personal assistants and Industrial robots.\nAt the same time, the Strong AI indicates that a machine has intelligence comparable to a\nhuman being with self-aware consciousness and can solve problems, learn, and plan for the\nfuture. Considering that humans are the most intelligent creatures, AI aims to create systems\nthat simulate human acts intelligently (What Is Artificial Intelligence and How Does AI Work?\n2023). For every human function, several computer science technologies attempt to imitate that\nact intelligently (TechEmergent, 2023). For instance, humans’ ability to write and read texts in a\nlanguage is the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Additionally, humans can listen and\nspeak, which belongs to speech recognition; because much of speech recognition is statistically\nbased, it is referred to as statistical learning. In this frame, various projects, as the augmentor\n(Lavidas et al., 2023) apply AI that takes advantage of big data and learning analytics to give\nAdvances in Mobile Learning Educational Research • SyncSci Publishing 818 of 824\nVolume 3 Issue 2, 2023 Stavros Athanassopoulos, Polyxeni Manoli, Maria Gouvi, et al.\nmultiple stakeholders intelligible proposals for effectively finding and recognizing educational\nresources, as well as for creating customized learning profiles that take into consideration\nindividual actors’ qualities, needs, and inclinations (Karakose et al., 2023).\nMoreover, the human brain can acquire knowledge, generate new ideas, and make decisions\nbased on the inside and machines, known as machine learning. At the same time, neural networks\nare the tool for their implementation. Depending on the nature of the data and the desired\noutcome, machine learning can be categorized as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised\nor reinforced learning. As mentioned above, NLP is the AI technology that simulates human\nwriting and reading. Sentiment Analysis, Machine Translation, Speech Recognition, Chatbots\nand Virtual Assistants are some applications that use this technology. In particular, Chatbots\nare software applications that perform specific functions, imitating human written and spoken\nspeech as well as possible. Namely, software answers our questions automatically and is used\nin various contexts, such as customer support, e-commerce, and personal assistance. Their\nfunctionality ranges from rule-based chatbots to more advanced AI-based chatbots.\nVery recently, on November 30, 2022, a new chatbot called ChatGPT appeared and became\ntrendy quickly. ChatGPT has over 100 million users within the first two months (NapSaga, 2023).\nAlthough chatbots have been used in educational contexts since the early 1970s, ChatGPT’s\npotential to simulate human conversation as realistically as possible opens a new and exciting\npath in language learning (Huang et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022; Kohnke et al., 2023). ChatGPT\nwas developed by OpenAI, drawing on various cutting-edge technologies to implement an\nadvanced language model that uses deep learning and NLP techniques to generate humanlike\ntexts in excellent quality according to the input provided. More specifically, it is an improved\nversion that builds upon the successes and lessons learned from earlier versions, such as GPT-\n3, which have employed the Transformer architecture and have yielded remarkable results\nin various NLP tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, problem-solving,\ncontent and grammar correction and question answering (OpenAI, 2023). Its ability to work on\ncomplicated tasks that require human intelligence, such as answering exam-style questions in\nbusiness, law, and medicine or writing academic texts, has placed it as an innovative learning\ntool, attracting researchers’ interest (Zhai, 2022).\nMoreover, ChatGPT supports multiple languages, including English and Korean and can\nmodify the content and format of the generated text to meet the user’s demands and needs,\nsimultaneously creating a natural conversational experience. The most striking feature of\nChatGPT is that it can generate text based on the user’s instruction, which means that the\ndesired answer can be gradually modified and developed depending on the users’ request for\nthe reader to be more detailed or succinct (Kim et al., 2023). In this context, the affordances of\nChatGPT for language learning and teaching have already been explored and acknowledged by\nresearchers, indicating promising results.\n2 Literature review\nSince the study focuses on exploring the use of ChatGPT in education, particularly L2 learn-\ning, the following literature review will be mainly restricted to it. However, many researchers\nhave explored the potential applications of ChatGPT in various fields, such as customer service,\nmental health, social media, etc., highlighting its potential to revolutionize multiple areas and\nimprove human-AI interactions in diverse settings.\n2.1 Education\nEducation aims to obtain knowledge; however, comparing education of the past with edu-\ncation of the future, this aim has been modified considering the advancement of technology\nand the digital era offering education a wide range of semiotic resources and communication\nchannels focusing on how to search for information and combine and edit knowledge (Cope &\nKalantzis, 2009). The use of ChatGPT, the latest offspring of technology, in education has been\ninvestigated by researchers, indicating a wide range of capabilities. In particular, in mathematics,\nPardos and Bhandari (2023) explored ChatGPT’s effectiveness in producing hints compared to\nthose made by human tutors in algebra. They revealed that both human tutors and ChatGPT had\npositive learning outcomes, highlighting that only the human tutor-generated hints resulted in\nstatistically significant gains. Simultaneously, Frieder et al. (2023) examined its potential in\nmathematical problems, indicating that ChatGPT’s math skills are much lower than those of a\ntypical graduate student in mathematics. As an AI language model, broader language uses of\nChatGPT have been explored. For instance, Feng et al. (2023) studied ChatGPT as a sentence\nsimplification tool and found that the results were close to the simplified sentences produced by\nhumans.\nAdvances in Mobile Learning Educational Research • SyncSci Publishing 819 of 824\nVolume 3 Issue 2, 2023 Stavros Athanassopoulos, Polyxeni Manoli, Maria Gouvi, et al.\nMoreover, Jiao et al. (2023) investigated the ability of ChatGPT to translate. They indicated\nthat it performed similarly to commercial translation products, such as Google Translate, for\nmore widespread European languages but struggled with less widespread ones. They suggested\nusing the source sentence into a more widespread pivot language before translating it into the\ntarget language. Mitrovic et al. (2023) probed into the way ChatGPT could answer different\nquestions by using specific patterns and found that it tended to describe experiences rather\nthan express feelings, use uncommon (unusual) words while refraining from using personal\npronouns, aggressive and rude language, which are usually attributed to human-generated texts.\nFurthermore, Zhai (2022) investigated whether the ChatGPT could write an academic paper,\nrevealing that ChatGPT could assist researchers in academic writing while reducing the time\nto complete the whole writing process within 2-3 hours. Another line of research (Khalil &\nEr, 2023) investigated whether essays produced by ChatGPT could be detected for plagiarism\nthrough the use of two popular plagiarism detection tools and showed that ChatGPT written\nproductions avoided detection by plagiarism detection software while having a high potential\nfor producing sophisticated text outputs.\n2.2 ChatGPT and language learning\nResearchers have already explored and acknowledged the affordances of ChatGPT for\nlanguage learning and teaching (Jurayev, 2023; Sukmayasa & Sudiana, 2023). However, the\nnumber of relevant studies still needs to be improved, as ChatGPT has been launched recently.\nTo begin with, Kohnke et al. (2023) discussed its affordances and indicated some uses in\nlanguage learning by providing examples of learning tasks produced by ChatGPT, such as\ntext production of various genres, text translation, grammar and content correction, vocabulary\nexplanation in multiple ways, production of reading comprehension questions (De La Cruz et\nal., 2023), which could be used by teachers and learners arguing that AI-driven digital tools,\nlike ChatGPT, are becoming increasingly important in language education. Other studies, for\nexample, Kim et al. (2023) discussed the functions and misconceptions of ChatGPT, supporting\nthat teachers and educational institutions should be encouraged to change their mentality to\nadapt teaching and assessment in consideration of the inevitable progress of technology. Kim et\nal. (2023) explored its effectiveness in designing course content based on Task-Based Language\nTeaching (TBLT). They indicated promising results, suggesting that ChatGPT has the potential\nto act as a language-learning tool.\nMoreover, Baskara and Mukarto (2023) discussed its use in language courses to generate\ntexts on various topics. They indicated that ChatGPT’s potential for language learning is signifi-\ncant, such as providing personalized language instruction and developing authentic language\nmaterial for learners, highlighting, simultaneously, concerns about the ethical implications of the\nsubstitution of human language teachers and the use of a machine learning system to generate\ntext. Similarly, Yan (2023) examined the use of ChatGPT in an L2 writing practicum, finding\nthat it had the potential to improve efficiency in writing and contribute to L2 writing pedagogy,\nexpressing, at the same time, concerns about threats to academic honesty and educational equity.\nHong (2023) explored the potential benefits of ChatGPT for foreign language teachers and the\nissues and risks associated with its use, arguing that ChatGPT offers significant opportunities for\nteachers and educational institutions to improve language teaching and assessment (Sholekah\net al., 2022). Despite some drawbacks, mainly focusing on ethical implications, ChatGPT has\nbeen seen as a versatile and valuable tool with significant potential to support learners and\npromote engaging and adaptive language learning. At the same time, simultaneously, researchers\nencourage language teachers to explore its pedagogical affordances.\n3 Methods\n3.1 Research rationale aims and questions\nConsidering, on the one hand, the contribution of AI technology to language learning and,\non the other hand, the first promising findings of the use of ChatGPT as an L2 learning tool\n(e.g., Hong, 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Kohnke et al., 2023; Yan, 2023), the present study\naimed to explore the effectiveness of ChatGPT as a feedback tool on L2 writing, especially\nfor refugees/migrants, who face extra language difficulties. According to relevant research,\nrefugees/migrants who belong to socially vulnerable populations differ not only in age, gender,\nand socio-cultural background but also in first language(s), language proficiency, and pre-\nsettlement experiences, making teachers’ work even more challenging (Beacco et al., 2017;\nDryden-Peterson, 2015; Kantzou et al., 2017). This socially vulnerable population often needs\nextra help to overcome language barriers and learn an L2, whose inclusion in the educational\nsystem of a hosting country can be challenging. At the same time, the number of pertinent\nAdvances in Mobile Learning Educational Research • SyncSci Publishing 820 of 824\nVolume 3 Issue 2, 2023 Stavros Athanassopoulos, Polyxeni Manoli, Maria Gouvi, et al.\nstudies on its use in language learning remains relatively limited, as Chat GPT has been recently\nlaunched. Therefore, there is a need for further research to unravel ChatGPT’s potential and\nlimitations in language learning. In this context, the following research question was formulated:\nTo what extent can the use of ChatGPT contribute to improving L2 writing in terms of\nvocabulary and grammar for students with a refugee/migrant background?\n3.2 Research participants and educational setting\nThe study was conducted in a Junior High School (Gymnasium) in an urban city, Patras,\nin south Greece. Two hundred forty-seven students attended the specific school, while its\nstaff consisted of 35 teachers. The school included reception classes for 42 students with\nspecial educational needs, while 50 students with a refugee/migrant background attended the\nmainstream classes. The school director and most educators have worked in this academic\nsetting for a long time (from 5 to 22 years) and have gained experience working with students\nfrom diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds.\nMore specifically, 8 Junior High School students aged 15 with a refugee/migrant background\nparticipated in the study. Their countries of origin varied, as most came from Albania, while\nothers came from Italy, Russia and the Philippines. Seven of the participants were females,\nwhile one student was male. Four participants were born and raised in Greece, while the\nrest have lived in Greece for ages ranging from 8 to 12 years. All participants could speak\nGreek proficiently. The research participants attended the third grade of Junior High School,\nparticularly the German class, which was offered twice weekly (45 minutes for each category).\nThey have been learning German as a foreign language for five years (level A2 according to the\nsixth level scale of the CEFR for Languages). The course book used in the third grade of High\nSchool was “Deutsch – ein Hit 2” “Issue A”.\n3.3 Research procedure\nThe research procedure took place for two weeks and was thematically integrated into the\ncurrently used syllabus, fitting with the main principles of the Integrated Foreign Languages\nCurriculum (IFLC, 2016). More specifically, at the first stage of the research, the students were\nasked to write a personal email to a German friend describing their favourite sport. Then, the\nChatGPT was used to correct their written outputs regarding grammar and vocabulary. ChatGPT\nwas particularly asked to improve their written texts’ vocabulary and grammar. In the second\nstage, the students received an improved version of their original emails regarding language\nand grammar. They were asked to study them thoroughly while discussing all the revisions\nand suggestions offered by ChatGPT, which students should pay attention to improve their\nfinal work. At the final stage, students were asked to be involved in the writing procedure by\naddressing a similar topic to their first attempt; namely, they were asked to write a personal\nemail to a German friend expressing their thoughts about sports and healthy life. The choice of\na related topic aimed to motivate students to use new but pertinent words and expressions used\nby ChatGPT in the improved texts to foster their writing skills.\n4 Results\nFor a more objective comparison of each student’s texts, we measured several qualitative\ncharacteristics, including Total Words, Unique Words, Average Words Per Sentence, and Most\nFrequent Words. These measurements were performed using the same ChatGPT platform to\nwhich we provided the text and requested the corresponding analyses. Subsequently, for each\nqualitative characteristic, we calculated the mean of the optimization across all students, as well\nas the best and worst-case scenarios.\nAccording to the results of the research, it was revealed that after using ChatGPT as a\nfeedback tool in L2 writing, there was an increase in the total number of words used by students\nin the improved version of their work. In particular, the increase in the total number of words\nranged from 2% in the case of Student 1 to 62% in the case of Student 6, while the mean of\nthe increase was 38%. Simultaneously, it was found that there was an increase in the unique\nwords that students used in their improved version of their work, with an average mean of 19,1\nper student, except for Student 1, whose final text had one unique word less than his first draft.\nOn the contrary, the maximum increase was observed in the case of student 6, who had 36\nmore unique words than in his initial work. The findings also showed that students made longer\nsentences using more words, which indicated improved L2 writing skills. More specifically,\nthe mean average of words per sentence was approximately 42%, while only Student 4 had a\ndecrease. Finally, in the last column of Table 1, we indicate each student’s most frequently used\nwords in the pre- and post-intervention texts.\nAdvances in Mobile Learning Educational Research • SyncSci Publishing 821 of 824\nVolume 3 Issue 2, 2023 Stavros Athanassopoulos, Polyxeni Manoli, Maria Gouvi, et al.\nTable 1 Results before and after ChatGPT use\nStudent\nTotal words Unique words Average Words Per Sentence Most frequent words\nBefore After Before After Before After Before After\n1 90 92 63 62 5.3 9.2 Mannschaft (3) Sport (4)\n2 91 127 62 75 6.1 11.5 Lieblingssport (4) gesund (5)\n3 82 131 62 89 8.2 11.9 V olleyball (2) gut (3)/ Gesundheit (3)\n4 113 146 80 97 10.3 9.7 V olleyball (3) gut (3)/ Sport (3)\n5 100 160 71 99 8.3 9.4 Tag (2)/ Lieblingssport (2) lieben (4)\n6 84 136 53 89 7.0 12.4 Lieblingssport (3)/ Leichtatletik (3) Tag (3) / lieben (3)\n7 91 101 62 74 6.5 9.2 V olleyball (2) trinken (2)/ trainiren(2)\n8 91 122 63 84 6.1 8.7 Lieblingssport (3) schwimmen (3)/ liebeb(3)\n5 Discussion\nChatGPT, an AI language model, is regarded as a multifaceted learning tool, as it can support\nlanguage learning in various ways, such as text generation in multiple genres (e.g., stories,\nrecipes, emails), translation, summarization, problem-solving, content and grammar correction,\nvocabulary enhancement and question answering (OpenAI, 2023) for many languages, skills,\ntopics, and levels (e.g., Huang et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022; Kohnke et al., 2023). Thus,\nChatGPT provides learning experiences in various contexts depending on learners’ needs (Kim\net al., 2023).\nConsidering the first promising findings of the use of ChatGPT as a language learning tool\n(e.g., Hong, 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Kohnke et al., 2023; Yan, 2023), the aim of the present\nstudy, which was a pilot study, was to explore how the use of ChatGPT could improve foreign\nlanguage writing in terms of vocabulary and grammar in a multilingual and multicultural\nclassroom. In particular, after the students’ first writing attempt, the researchers asked ChatGPT\nto improve the vocabulary and grammar of the texts, while the students received an improved\nversion in terms of language and grammar; then, the students were asked to produce another\nwriting piece of work on a similar topic to their first attempt. The study results indicated an\nincrease in the total number of words, the unique words and the average word number per\nsentence in the improved version of their work (Can & Bardakci, 2022; Kallou & Kikilia,\n2021). Overall, the results of the study were promising, indicating that ChatGPT could act\nas a language learning tool in L2 writing and contribute to a supportive learning environment,\nwhich is in line with the few relevant studies (Baskara & Mukarto, 2023; Yan, 2023). To the\nbest of the researcher’s knowledge, the focus has not been put on multilingual classrooms, as\nstudents with a refugee/migrant background, who belong to socially vulnerable populations,\nhave different language needs, face extra language difficulties and need extra help and support\non the educators’ part to overcome language barriers and become efficient learners (Beacco et\nal., 2017; Dryden-Peterson, 2015; Kantzou et al., 2017).\nSince the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, there has been considerable debate about\nits impact on the field of education, as some researchers acknowledged its potential as a learning\ntool to support education, while others pointed out some drawbacks, highlighting that its use\nshould be viewed with an amount of scepticism. Namely, ChatGPT can be abused and possibly\nhinder the learning process, as it can be used for cheating by directly providing answers or\nperforming tasks instead of learners (Kim et al., 2023; Kohnke et al., 2023). Turnitin was\nrecently upgraded to detect text written by AI. Simultaneously, it was mentioned that ChatGPT\ncould not provide detailed and systematic feedback that could lead learners to improve their\ncommunication skills (Kim et al., 2023). Moreover, a critical stance is required on the learners’\npart, as the information’s accuracy and the responses provided by ChatGPT should always be\nchecked (Kim et al., 2023; Kohnke et al., 2023). To avoid possible abuse of the latest model of\nAl, it is strongly advised that a human educator is needed to supervise learners while employing\nChatGPT in the educational context, as was the case of the present study. Kr¨ugel et al. (2023)\nsuggested that relevant training should be provided to enhance users’ digital literacy skills.\nDespite the ethical and societal impact of rapidly advancing technologies, such as ChatGPT,\nthis study provides insights into its use as a foreign language learning tool to support writing\nin multilingual classrooms. It paves the way for more classroom-based research to exploit\nChatGPT’s potential. However, there are some limitations of the present study that we need\nto consider, such as the relatively small sample of participants and the short duration of the\nteaching intervention, which does not allow us to generalize the findings of the research. After\nall, as mentioned above, this was a pilot study, which constituted the researchers’ first attempt\nto apply ChatGPT in multilingual classrooms and explore its feasibility. In this context, further\nAdvances in Mobile Learning Educational Research • SyncSci Publishing 822 of 824\nVolume 3 Issue 2, 2023 Stavros Athanassopoulos, Polyxeni Manoli, Maria Gouvi, et al.\nresearch is needed, including a more significant number of learners in different educational\nsettings and language skills, to verify and prove the potential of ChatGPT in L2 language\nlearning.\nOverall, the promising findings of the current study testify that the integration of AI language\nmodels, such as ChatGPT, into the education setting has just begun, providing learners with\ndynamic and effective learning environments beyond traditional classrooms, which is consistent\nwith relevant research (˙Ipek et al., 2023); they pointed out that performing high-level cognitive\nskills, such as information production, analysis, and synthesis through technological means\nhas paved the way for a new paradigm, which education should take advantage of. However,\nto avoid the negative aspects of AI language models, they should be used in a responsible,\nethical and wise manner, while users, educators and learners should hold a healthy amount of\nscepticism about their use (Aljanabi, 2023; ˙Ipek et al., 2023). Finally, apart from the deficient\nand convenient sample, another limitation is that the study that uses self-reports runs the risk of\nsocially desired responses and measurement bias (Lavidas et al., 2022).\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n6 Fields of AI.
