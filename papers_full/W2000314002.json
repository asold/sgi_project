Several\nstudies on tool-use in both healthy and brain-damaged popula-\ntions have consistently reported that tool use alters our percep-\ntion of space. Two main interpretations have been put forward\nto account for perceptual changes observed following tool-use:\neither space perceptionper sewould be altered in such a way that\nfar stimuli become processed as if they were nearer (Berti and\nFrassinetti, 2000; Maravita et al., 2001; Farnè et al., 2005; Witt\nand Profﬁtt, 2008; Holmes, 2012; Osiurak et al., 2012; Bourgeois\net al., 2014), or alternatively tool-use would displace the atten-\ntional focus to the tip of the tool (Holmes et al., 2007). These\neffects have been related to plastic features of the multisensory\nprocessing of the peripersonal space, as identiﬁed electrophysio-\nlogically in non-human primates: in monkeys trained to retrieve\ndistant objects with a rake,Iriki et al. (1996)revealed that visuo-\ntactile hand centered receptive ﬁelds appeared to extend along the\ntool axis (see for review,Maravita and Iriki, 2004; Cardinali et al.,\n2009a; Brozzoli et al., 2012). In addition, tool-use modiﬁes the\nspatial metric of our own body. When asked to point to touched\nlandmarks on their arm (middle ﬁngertip, wrist, elbow) after\nusing a mechanical grabber to reach and grasp objects, neurotyp-\nical participants localized these landmarks as if their touched\nbody-parts were more distant from each other than before tool-\nuse (Cardinali et al., 2009b, 2011a; Sposito et al., 2012; Miller\net al., 2013). Most interesting for the present study, besides mod-\nifying space and body perceptual metrics, tool-use shapes our\nactions. The body representation we use for action (i.e., the body\nschema) is modiﬁed when using tools in a way such that the\ntool is incorporated and becomes part of our body (Baccarini\nand Maravita, 2013). In humans, we demonstrated that using a\nmechanical grabber that extends the arm’s functional length by\n40 cm, extends the subject’s arm length representation (Cardinali\net al., 2009b, 2012). Our sensorimotor system seems to be able\nto immediately transfer the control from the arm to the new\narm + tool conﬁguration (Van der Steen and Bongers, 2011).\nThe motor control of free-hand reaching movements performed\nright after use of this tool exhibits an altered kinematics: the rep-\nresentation of an elongated arm in the body schema translates in\nthe later occurrence and reduced amplitude of some kinematics\nevents (acceleration, velocity, deceleration peaks). Such changes\nin motor control of the arm have been considered as the key\nkinematics signatures for the incorporation of the tool into the\nbody schema (Cardinali et al., 2011b) and revealed the latter is a\nhighly plastic representation that quickly builds-up on previous\nexperience.\nwww.frontiersin.org M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 9 2| 1\n\nBaccarini et al. T ool-use imagery alters body representation\nStrikingly, mere mentally simulated motor experiences are\nsufﬁcient in some cases to trigger subsequent actions modiﬁca-\ntions and athletes commonly use motor imagery to improve their\nperformance (Driskell et al., 1994; Roure et al., 1999). Motor\nimagery might be sufﬁcient to acquire functional object knowl-\nedge, however the built representations have been shown to be\nless detailed than when experiencing actual movement with the\nobject (Macuga et al., 2012; Paulus et al., 2012). Moreover, brain\nareas recruited to perform actual or imagined movement exe-\ncution are not strictly overlapping (Imazu et al., 2007;s e ef o r\nreview Dietrich, 2008). Nevertheless a contagion from movement\nimagery to movement execution is possible as both evolve on a\nsimilar time-scale and follow very similar biomechanical rules.\nMotor imagery follows so faithfully the constraints imposed to\nthe motor system that the postural adjustments normally accom-\npanying a voluntary reaching movement while standing up are\nalso present in an imagined reaching situation ( Boulton and\nMitra, 2013). Execution time of mentally simulated movements\nhas been shown to be comparable in duration to actually executed\nmovements (Papaxanthis et al., 2002;f o rr e v i e w ,s e eJeannerod\nand Frak, 1999; Guillot and Collet, 2005). An important con-\nstraint of the motor system is the speed accuracy trade-off known\nas Fitts law (1954). According to this law, increasing the veloc-\nity of execution of an action leads to decrease in accuracy, and\nconversely, increasing the accuracy demands increases the time\nneeded to perform the task. Several studies have demonstrated\nthat Fitt’s law holds in motor imagery, imagined movement times\nlinearly increasing with task difﬁculty (Decety and Jeannerod,\n1995; Maruff et al., 1999). In a prehension task paradigm,Frak\net al. (2001)had subjects to physically or mentally grasp a cylin-\nder between the index and thumb while varying the orientation\nof the axis formed by the opposed ﬁngertips on the object, the\nso-called opposition axis. When free to adopt a natural ﬁnger\npositioning on the object, subjects typically tend to keep the\nopposition axis invariant from trial to trial, as changing it deter-\nmines an additional cost on the musculo-articulatory system\n(Paulignan et al., 1997). Frak et al. (2001)elegantly demonstrated\nthat prehension movements requiring different pre-determined\norientations of the opposition axis induce similar modulations\nof movement time for both physically executed and imagined\nmovements. Recently,Jacobs et al. (2010)used a similar paradigm\nto investigate free-hand grasping and grasping with a handheld\ntool. Subjects’ performance during mental imagery respected\nthe bio-mechanical constraints imposed by the tool during real\nmovement execution (see alsoRieger and Massen, 2014). T ool-\nuse imagery has been less explored but is known to modify space\nperception as tool execution does (Witt and Profﬁtt, 2008; Davoli\net al., 2012; Gabbard and Caçola, 2013) and to follow Fitt’s law\n(Macuga et al., 2012). Most recently it has been reported that\nexpert tool-users are sensitive to the held tool during imagery\nwhereas naive tool-users are not (Bisio et al., 2014).\nOn the one hand, thus, evidence from real tool-use indicates\nthat it modiﬁes the kinematics of subsequent free-hand move-\nments as if they were performed with a longer arm; on the other\nhand, mental imagery of tool-use seems to reproduce tool-use\nexecution quite accurately. Taken together, these ﬁndings raise the\nquestion of whether mere tool-use imagery is sufﬁcient to modify\nthe representation of the arm’s length. T o answer this question we\ndesigned an experiment in which the rationale was the follow-\ning: if imagining using the same mechanical grabber that extends\nthe arm’s length by 40 cm (Cardinali et al., 2009a,b, 2012) is suf-\nﬁcient for this tool to be incorporated into the body schema\nand thus increases the subject’s represented arm length, then the\nreal execution of free hand prehension movements subsequent to\ntool-use imagery should display those kinematics signatures that\nwe observed after actual tool-use. Since motor imagery is known\nto be modulated by task difﬁculty, varying task difﬁculty is an efﬁ-\ncient way to control that motor imagery was properly performed\n(Lotze and Halsband, 2006). We therefore applied the paradigm\nintroduced by Frak et al. (2001), and manipulated the orienta-\ntion of the opposition axis to be used to grasp a cylinder in order\nto vary movement’s difﬁculty. In different sessions separated by\none day, participants were required to perform prehension move-\nments toward objects with different oppositions axes before and\nafter having mentally simulated these movements with their free\nhand (as a control), or using the mechanical grabber.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPARTICIPANTS\nSixteen neurologically healthy subjects (8 male; mean age 22.4\nyears; SD: 3.7; range from 18 to 32) participated in the study.\nAll were right-handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal\nvision. All participants gave written informed consent to par-\nticipate in the study, which was approved by the local ethics\ncommittee and conformed to the Helsinki Declaration.\nAPPARATUS AND PROCEDURES\nParticipants were comfortably seated in front of a table with the\nright hand closed in a pinch-shaped grip on a switch. The left\nhand, palm down, was pressing a response button. The target\nobject was a plastic cylinder (5 cm in diameter and 17 cm height)\nplaced on the table at a distance of 35 cm along the sagittal axis, in\nline with subjects’ right shoulder. Two colored dots on the upper\nedge of the cylinder marked the grasp landing positions required\nfor the tips of the thumb (red) and index ﬁngers (yellow). The\nvirtual line connecting these two points of contact determined\nthe Opposition Axis (OA) of the grip. At the beginning of each\ntrial, the cylinder was presented with one of three possible OA,\nnamely −22\n◦,0 ◦ and +22◦ with respect to the subject trunk.\nEach OA was presented an equal number of times in a pseudo-\nrandomized order. A horizontal arrow was taped at 13 cm of\nheight from the table on a wooden block, located about 10 cm to\nthe left of the cylinder and served to indicate the height at which\nthe participants had to lift the object (Figure 1).\nThe experiment consisted of three tasks, each presented\nover two consecutive days: Pre-imagery free-hand grasping task\n(18 trials), Motor Imagery task (54 trials), and Post-imagery\nfree-hand grasping task (18 trials). During the Pre- and Post-\nimagery free-hand grasping task, participants were required to\nreach, grasp and lift the target object up to the arrow with their\nright hand (seeFigure 2). They were instructed to grasp the object\nusing a precision grip by placing their thumb and index ﬁngertips\non the respective colored dots. Once the trial was performed, par-\nticipants got back to the starting position, closed their eyes and\nFrontiers in Psychology | Cognition M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 9 2| 2\nBaccarini et al. T ool-use imagery alters body representation\nFIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of the experimental set up from\nthe subject’s point of view (upper panel) and from above (lower\npanel). Subjects placed their right hand on a starting switch (purple) and\nthe left hand on a response button (green). The target object was a\ncylinder, located 35 cm from the starting point. On its upper side were\ntwo colored dots indicating the location of the ﬁngers (red for the thumb\nand yellow for the index); the line between these two dots constituted\nthe opposition axis, which could be of three orientations: −22◦,0 ◦ and\n+22◦. On the left an arrow indicated the height to which the object\nshould be lifted.\nFIGURE 2 | Experimental design and procedure. The experiment took\nplace during two consecutive days, each including three experimental\nsessions: Pre-imagery free-hand execution session (18 trials), Motor Imagery\nsession (54 trials), Post-imagery free-hand execution session (18 trials).\nwaited for an acoustical “go” signal to open their eyes and perform\nthe next trial.\nDuring the Motor imagery task of day 1, subjects were required\nto imagine using their right hand to reach for, grasp and lift\nthe cylinder up to the height indicated by the arrow. They were\ninstructed to wait for an acoustical go signal to open their eyes\nand start imagining performing the task. Participants had to raise\ntheir left hand to release the switch as they started their imagery\ntrial, and to put their hand back down to press the switch once\nit was accomplished (i.e., the object was lifted at the height indi-\ncated by the arrow). Participants’ right hand was kept still on the\nright switch during the whole duration of the imagery task. Two\npauses were planned after 18 trials and 36 trials respectively. Other\npauses were delivered if required. During pauses participants were\nallowed to open and close the ﬁngers of their right hand and to\nmove their arms. The Motor imagery task of day 2 was identical\nto that of day 1, except that subjects had to imagine performing\nthe prehension movement with a grabber they were holding still\nin their right hand. The grabber was constituted of an ergonomic\nhandle (9 cm) ﬁtted with a lever, a 33-cm-long rigid shaft, and a\n“hand” with two articulated ﬁngers (10 cm). Squeezing the lever\n(vertically) made the “ﬁngers” of the tool close (horizontally). The\ngrabber used here was identical to that used in previous work\ndocumenting effects of actual too-use on subsequent free-hand\nkinematics (Cardinali et al., 2009b). During the whole duration\nof the imagery task the “tool ﬁngers” were kept in a pinch grip\nposture on the start switch. During pauses, subjects were allowed\nt om o v et h ea r m ,b u tc o u l dn o td r o pt h et o o l .I no r d e rt ob e\nable to imagine using the grabber, at the end of day 1 subjects\nwere familiarized with the tool by performing 18 grasping trials\n(6 for each opposition axis). T ool-use imagery never took place\non day 1 to avoid potentials tool integration effects to carry over\non day 2.\nKINEMATIC RECORDING\nThree infrared light emitting diodes (IREDs) were placed on the\nsubjects’ right hand: on the medial lower corner of the thumb\nnail, on the lateral lower corner of the index ﬁnger nail and on the\nwww.frontiersin.org M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 9 2| 3\nBaccarini et al. T ool-use imagery alters body representation\nskin proximal to the styloid process of the radius at the wrist. The\nreaching component of the movement was characterized by the\nwrist marker displacement, while the grip component was charac-\nterized by the thumb and index displacement. Spatial localization\nof the markers was recorded with an Optotrak 3020 (Northern\nDigital Inc; sampling rate: 200 Hz; 3D resolution: 0.01 mm at\n2.25 m distance). Analyzed parameters included latencies and\namplitudes of acceleration, velocity and deceleration peaks for\nthe transport component, and latency and amplitude of the max-\nimum grip aperture for the grip component. The total movement\nduration of imagined movements (from release to press of the\nleft response button, corresponding to the same events of actual\nmovements) was also extracted.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nT o assess the effect of the OA on imagined movements, sub-\njects’ average imagined movement durations (MD) were sub-\nmitted to a repeated measure ANOV A with Effector (hand/tool)\nand Opposition Axis ( −22\n◦/0◦/+22◦) as within-subject fac-\ntors. In order to establish the effect of motor imagery with\nthe tool on subsequent free-hand movements, we performed a\nrepeated measure ANOV A on movement kinematic parameters\nwith type of Imagery (hand/tool), Session (pre / post imagery)\nand Opposition Axis (−22\n◦/0◦/+22◦) as within-subject factors.\nWhen necessary, Newman-Keulspost-hoc test were used.\nRESULTS\nMOVEMENT DURATIONS DURING MOTOR IMAGERY\nAs shown in Figure 3, the analysis revealed no signiﬁcant\ndifference between hand and tool imagined movement dura-\ntions [F\n(1, 15) = 0.60, p = 0.45; MD = 2538 vs. 2633 ms]. A\nmain effect of Opposition Axis [F(2, 30) = 16.0, p < 0.001; η2\np =\n0.52] highlighted that the most difﬁcult OA( −22◦) required\nlonger performance time ( MD = 2702 ms) compared to the\nother orientations (0◦ MD = 2489 ms;+22◦ MD = 2565 ms, all\np-values < 0.002), which tended to differ between them (p =\n0.055). The interaction between Effector and Opposition Axis\nalmost reached signiﬁcance [F(2, 30) = 3.0, p = 0.065], poten-\ntially suggesting that OA may have a slightly different impact on\ntool and free-hand imagery.\nTaken together these results highlight the difﬁculty raised by\nthe most unnatural opposition axis (−22\n◦)i r r e s p e c t i v eo ft h e\nused effector, indicating that participants performed free-hand\nand tool imagery tasks reliably.\nEFFECT OF FREE-HAND vs. TOOL MOTOR IMAGERY ON SUBSEQUENT\nFREE-HAND MOVEMENTS\nT o investigate the effects of tool-use imagery on the subsequent\nfree-hand movement execution, the following section focuses\non the critical interaction between the factors type of Imagery\n(hand vs. tool) and Session (pre vs. post imagery) across the\nkinematic parameters of the transport and grasping compo-\nnents (see Ta b l e s 1 , 2for an exhaustive report of the statistical\nresults and means respectively). Two of such interactions were\nfound to be signiﬁcant, for the wrist velocity peak [F\n(1, 15) =\n11, p < 0.01; η2\np = 0.42] and the deceleration peak [F(1, 15) =\n9.76, p < 0.01; η2\np = 0.39; see Figure 4]. Free-hand imagery did\nFIGURE 3 | Imagined movement duration.

The pre imagery session of day 1\ndiffered from that of day 2, in that subjects reached higher veloc-\nity and deceleration peaks -before motor imagery- in day 2 as\ncompared to day 1 (allp < 0.0 1 ) ,c o m p a t i b l ew i t hs o m ep r a c -\ntice effects. Critically, participants’ free-hand movements per-\nformed after tool-use imagery exhibited signiﬁcantly decreased\nwrist velocity peak (pre 827 mm/s vs. post: 785 mm/s,p < 0.02)\nand deceleration peak (pre:−2829 mm/s\n2 vs. post:−2569 mm/s2,\np < 0.04) with respect to those performed before tool imagery. As\nexpected, no signiﬁcant interaction was found on the kinematic\nparameters of the grasping component.\nDISCUSSION\nHere we investigated the effects of tool-use imagery vs. free\nhand imagery on subsequent free-hand grasping movements. As\nmovement imagery is sensitive to task difﬁculty we asked par-\nticipants to conform their ﬁnal grip to three opposition axes\nof varying difﬁculty. In line with our expectations, the opposi-\ntion axes differently taxed imagined movement durations, thus\nconﬁrming that participants successfully engaged in the imagery\ntasks. Our analysis then focused on the differences of free-hand\nimagery vs. tool-use imagery on subsequent movements. While\nfree hand grasping imagery did not affect actual free-hand move-\nments, the latter movements performed after tool-use imagery\nwere characterized by signiﬁcant decrease of both wrist velocity\nand deceleration peaks. T ogether with previous ﬁndings from our\ngroup, these results indicate that imagery of tool-use may be suf-\nﬁcient to update the representation of the arm length used to\ne x e c u t ef r e e - h a n dm o v e m e n t s .W eh a v ei n d e e dr e p o r t e dp r e v i -\nously that using a tool to grasp an object modiﬁes the kinematics\nof subsequent free-hand movements as if the participant per-\nformed object prehension with a longer arm (Cardinali et al.,\nFrontiers in Psychology | Cognition M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 9 2| 4\nBaccarini et al.

Here we investigated whether\ntool-use imagery could be sufﬁcient to induce such modiﬁcations\nof the body schema. While imagery has been largely explored in\npsychology and cognitive sciences, tool-use imagery has become a\nﬁeld of investigation only recently.Rieger and Massen (2014)have\nexamined how different tools translate in different tool imagery\nperformances by requiring participants to color a rectangle using\npens with different thicknesses. As it was the case for physically\nexecuted actions, imagined actions were inﬂuenced by the pen’s\nthickness, the thinnest one giving rise to longer movement times\nwww.frontiersin.org M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 9 2| 5\nBaccarini et al.

(2012)\nreported that despite some inaccuracy, the Fitt’s law holds for\nmovements imaginarily performed with tools.\nT o make a step forward, here we tested whether tool-use\nimagery effects, besides inﬂuencing ongoing performance dur-\ning the tool-use imagery task, can last sufﬁciently to modify\nactual movements performed afterwards,w i t h o u tt h et o o l .W e\nﬁrst aimed to ensure that imagery was accurately performed. T o\nthis aim, we varied the difﬁculty of an object prehension task\nby requiring participants to grasp a cylinder putting their index\nand thumb or the tool’s “ﬁngers” in predetermined positions on\nthe cylinder, thus creating different orientations of the opposition\naxis(OA) between the ﬁngertips. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm and extend\nthose ofFrak et al. (2001)as we show that the−22\n◦ orientation\nof the OA is the most difﬁcult and hence time consuming one,\nirrespective of whether movements were imagined with the hand\nor the tool.\nWhen considering the effects of tool imagery on subsequent\nmovements, our results make a considerable step further by\ndemonstrating that tool-use imagery is sufﬁcient to warrant tool\nincorporation in the body schema (i.e., the representation the\nbrain uses to plan and execute actions). When comparing free\nhand movements performed before and after tool-use imagery,\nmovement kinematics presented wrist velocity and deceleration\npeaks of decreased amplitude. Previously, after physical tool-use,\nwe reported such reductions in amplitude for the very same\nkinematic parameters, accompanied by protracted latencies and\ndiscussed these kinematics modiﬁcations as the hallmark of tool\nincorporation in the body schema (Cardinali et al., 2009b, 2012).\nSimilar to previous work, here the direction of the changes\ntriggered by tool-use imagery on the subsequent movement kine-\nmatics (i.e., the reduction of maximum velocity and deceleration\npeaks) is compatible with a change of the represented length of\nthe arm in the direction of its elongation. Compared to short-arm\npeople, long(er)-armed participants naturally tend to perform\nthe same grasping action with reduced velocity and decelera-\ntion peaks. For such movements, they also tend to display longer\nlatencies of these parameters (see supplemental data inCardinali\net al., 2009b). In the present study, a relatively brief tool-use\nimagery task appeared sufﬁcient to reduce the maximal amplitude\nof transport component parameters, thus suggesting profound\nconsequences for real movements, from imagined movement exe-\ncution. In contrast to our previous work, the latencies of the same\nparameters were not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by tool-use imagining\nFrontiers in Psychology | Cognition M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 9 2| 6\nBaccarini et al. T ool-use imagery alters body representation\nsuggesting that although very similar, tool-use imagery is not in\nall respects identical to actual tool-use execution. Nevertheless the\nmodiﬁcations in motor control did replicate those found after\nactual tool-use both in the direction (i.e., reduction) and speci-\nﬁcity, affecting selectively the transport component parameters\nand leaving the grasping ones unaltered (Cardinali et al., 2009b,\n2012).\nNoteworthy, the modiﬁcations on real hand movements\ninduced by tool-use imagery unambiguously points to a tool\nincorporation in the body schema (e.g., reduced wrist velocity)\nand as such differ from the learning effects typically reported\nafter mental practice (increased performance due to increased\nvelocity). This observation ﬁnds additional support in the results\nof free-hand imagery performed in day 1. Indeed, normal sub-\njects are by essence experts in performing manual prehension\nand hence mental training with the very same effector was inef-\nfective in triggering any signiﬁcant kinematic modiﬁcation of\nsubsequent executed movements (Allami et al., 2007). Moreover,\nthe pre imagery session of day 2 as compared to that of day\n1 displayed increased velocity and deceleration peaks, an effect\nthat is exactly opposite to the one observed after tool-use\nimagery.\nFinally, potential limitations of our study need to be addressed.\nFirst, the lack of execution session with the tool, before motor\nimagery, prevented us from directly comparing execution and\nimagery movement duration with the tool. Our main aim was\nnot to compare tool execution and tool imagery (seeRieger and\nMassen, 2014and Macuga et al., 2012for this comparison), rather\nour study focused on tool-use vs. free-hand imagery effects on\nsubsequent free-hand movements. A second potential limitation\narises from the fact that to avoid potential carry-over effects free-\nhand imagery and tool-use imagery were not counterbalanced,\ntool-use imagery occurring always on day 2 after hand imagery.\nThe post-test performed on day 2 is thus the fourth time subjects\nexecuted the free-hand grasping task. One could have expected\na facilitation effect similar to that observed between the pre ses-\nsion of day 1 and 2; by contrast, velocity and deceleration peaks\ndecreased after tool-use imagery, an effect that is thus compat-\nible with our previous results obtained after physical tool-use.\nThird, it might have been of interest to directly compare the con-\nsequences of both tool-use execution and tool-use imagery. Since\nwe used the very same paradigm and grabber as the one we used\nfor evaluating the effects of tool use execution (Cardinali et al.,\n2009b, 2012), the results obtained here nevertheless point to some\ndifferential effect of imagined vs. real tool-use, as the velocity and\ndeceleration peaks, but not the latencies of these parameters, were\naffected by tool-use imagery.\nT o conclude, tool-use imagery not only adheres to most of the\nphysical rules of actual movement execution, but has protracted\nconsequences on the real execution of movements performed\nafterwards without the tool that are readily understandable as the\nproduct of previous tool incorporation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by FRC (Fondation pour le Recherche\nsur le Cerveau), the Labex/Idex (ANR-11-LABX-0042), the James\nS.
