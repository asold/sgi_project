In an electrical machine the dif-\nferent electrodynamic, thermodynamic and mechanic fields inter-\nplay simultaneously. Therefore a lot of technical and economic \nfactors need to be harmonized in the design process. Moreover by \nthe large number of the optimized parameters this task belongs to \nthe branch of the most general mathematical optimization prob-\nlems [1, 2]. Because of the complexity of this task the transformer \ndesign process is split up two main different stages in practice \n(Fig. 1): the preliminary and the final design stages [3-7].\nThe subject of this paper is only the preliminary design \nstage. Here the main challenging task is to find the key perfor -\nmance parameters of a cost optimal solution in a limited time \nto give a decent answer for a price quotation request. Gener -\nally, the main objective of the large electrical machine design \nis to minimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) by reducing \nthe lifetime cost of the power losses and the manufacturing \ncosts. Kapp mentioned this optimization problem in his book \n[8] at the beginning of the last century and showed a simple \nanalytical approach to determine the key design parameters of \nthe cost optimal transformer design. Since then a wide range of \nanalytical and numerical method based algorithms have been \nproposed in the literature, from the simple approximative solu -\ntions [9] to the solvers which use the recent achievements of \ncomputational mathematics (e.g. neural networks, Monte Carlo \nmethods, genetic algorithms, etc.) [9-11]. This shows that trans-\nformer design optimization is an active research field nowadays.\nThe focus of this paper - a geometric programming (GP) \nbased meta-heuristic design optimization method - has been \npresented in the previous article of the authors [12]. This \nGeometrec Programming based novel solution has compared \nto three multi design transformer methods (MDM) [2, 13].\nThese three MDM subvariants which are examined in this \npaper, contain the same calculation methods as shown in [12] \nregarding meta-heuristic optimization, however, different opti -\nmum search algorithms are implemented (brute force search, \nparticle swarm optimization (PSO) and gray wolf optimization \n(GWO)) to search the optimal design.

Tamus\na simple brute force search or combined with several genetic, \nevolutionary algorithms like PSO can be found in the literature \n[2, 9, 14, 15], but the GWO algorithm has not been used previ -\nously for this transformer design optimization problem.\nFig. 1 Stages of a transformer design process [16]\nThe paper is organized in the following way. The first sec -\ntion gives a brief overview of the main design formulas of the \nrealized transformer model. After that, in the second section the \nfour examined optimum search models are shown, and finally \nin the Results and Discussion section, the performance of these \nfour transformer design algorithms are discussed and compared \nin a real world transformer optimization task. \n2 Design formulas for the preliminary design \noptimization\nThis section describes briefly the applied design formulas of \na three phase core type power transformer optimization. This \ndesign process is the same as the geometric programming based \nalgorithm [12, 17]. At this rough preliminary design stage the \ntransformer is modelled by the active part (the core and wind -\nings) because its mass and dimensions determine the total cost \nof the equipment ( Table 1). The generally used two winding \nmodel extended with a regulating winding and the dimensions \nof the transformer tank, which are already capable to take into \nconsideration the limitations of the outer dimensions and the \nmass of the tank. By the sake of simplicity, in the examined \nmodels the high voltage winding is regulated with an on-load \ntap changer. The GP based algorithms take every performance \nparameter into consideration with a separate variable ( Table 1) \nin the constraint equalities and inequalities which are formulated \nin a special posynomial and monomial format [18]. In contrast \nto the MDM based algorithms – which use the design formulas \nin their classical form – the new method contains and varies \nonly the independent variables of this optimization problem.\nFig. 2 The figure shows the steps of the realized MDM algorithm.\n71\nPerformance Comparison 2017 61 1\nTable 1 List of the transformer model’s performance parameters to be optimized.\nIndependent variables\nQuantity Dimension Variable  \nCore diameter mm Dc\nFlux density in the core T B\nMain insulation distance mm g\nCurrent density\nsecondary A\nmm 2 js\nprimary A\nmm 2 jp\nregulating A\nmm 2 jr\nWinding height secondary mm hs\nDependent variables  \nLoad Loss kW Pll\nNo Load Loss kW Pnll\nWidth of the working window mm s\nCore mass t Mc\nTank length mm L\nTank width mm W\nTank height mm H\nWinding thickness\nsecondary mm ts\nprimary mm tp\nregulating mm tr\nMean radius\nsecondary mm rs\nprimary mm rp\nregulating mm rr\nAbstract variables for short-circuit impedance calculation  \na, b, c, d, e, f  \n2.1 Objective function\nThe objective function in each examined transformer opti -\nmization algorithm is based on the capitalized cost of the trans-\nformer. This function contains the manufacturing cost of the \nactive part and the cost of the calculated losses: \nfK PK PC Mnlll lk k\nk\nn\n01 2\n0\n=⋅ +⋅ +⋅ ,\n=\n∑\nwhere  f0  is the TCO of the transformer’s active part in € and \nalso the objective function of this optimization method.  K1  is \nthe capitalized cost of the no-load loss and  K2  is the load loss \ncapitalization cost in €/kW.  Pnll  is the no-load loss of the trans-\nformer in kW and  Pll  is the sum of the load losses generated in \nthe transformers’ active part in kW unit.  Mk  is the mass of the \npart of the model which is represented by  k  in kg.  Ck  repre-\nsents the specific cost of the transformer part in €/kg.\n2.2 Turn voltage\nThe turn voltage of the windings is calculated from the given \npower and the independent variables, the calculation can be \nformulated in the next form: \nPR fh tjwl cc in in in in= 44 4 22. λλ\nwhere  Pw  is the power of a single wounded limb,  λc  is the \nfilling factor of the transformer’s core.\n2.3 Core and no-load loss calculation\nSimilarly to the meta-heuristic method in [12], in the case of \na three phase three legged core, the core mass can be calculated \nby the following formulas:\nMM MMcl eg yoke corner=+ +,\nMRcorner cc fe=⋅ ⋅⋅ ⋅,3 λπ ρζ\nMR EI EI hcolumn cc fe TO PB OT in=⋅ ⋅⋅ ⋅+ +() ,2 λπ ρ\nMR sp Ryoke cc fe dc=⋅ ⋅⋅ ⋅⋅ +⋅ +⋅() ,2 42 6λπ ρ\nwhere  Mcorner  is the mass of the corners of the core,  Mleg  is \nthe mass of the leg,  Myoke  is the mass of the yoke.  λc  is the \nfilling factor of the core, it depends on the quality of the ap -\nplied electrical steel and the construction technology.  ζ  is a \ntechnology dependent factor for the core volume calculation,  \nρfe  is the density of the electrical steel.  EITOP  and  EIBOT  are the \nend insulation distances, between the bottom and the top of the \nyoke and the inner winding and  pd  is the phase insulation. The  \nhin  winding is used as a reference height in the model as in the \nmeta-heuristic method based optimization [12]. The height of \nthe outer and the regulating windings are taken into considera -\ntion by a simple multiplication of one factor. \nA loss function is fitted to the applied electrical steel [19] \nlike in the case of the meta-heuristic method [1, 12, 20].: \nPM fpnllc bn ll=⋅ ⋅\nwhere,  fb  is the building factor which depends on the tech -\nnology. The effect of the manufacturing technology and the \nbuilding-factor whose typical value is 1.2 in the case of a rough \ncalculation at the preliminary design stage.\n2.4 Winding mass and loss calculation\nThe mass of a transformer winding is formulated in the next \nform: \nmR tt hkk kk kk in=+ ()2πρλ α\nwhere  ρ  is the copper density and  λk  is the copper filling \nfactor in the winding  k .  αk  is a constant multiplier, which \ntakes the height of the winding into account.  Rk ,  tk  are the \n(1)\n(2)\n(8)\n(7)\n(6)\n(4)\n(3)\n(5)\n72\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci. T. Orosz, B. Borbély, Z. Á.

(Rk + tk )  takes \ninto consideration that \nPm jllkC uk k, =⋅ +()∑ ρκ 1\nwhere  ρCu  is the copper resistance  Ω ∙ m  at  75 °C,  k  repre-\nsents the winding,  jk  is the current density in the  k th winding \nin  A / mm2\n .  κ  is an empirical constant which consider the \noptimal ratio  PAC / PDC  of the losses [1, 22].\n2.5 Short Circuit Impedance (SCI)\nThe SCI can be calculated by analytically in the following \nway:\nSC I% fP\nUh s\nRt Rt Rgwl\nT\nin in ou ou\nm() = +.()\n⋅+ +\n \n\n2\n03 23 3\n0\n2\nπµ\nwhere the  SCI  is given in [%]. The  UT  means the turn volt -\nage,  Pwl  the built-in power in a wounded limb. In this type of \ntransformer core it holds that  Pwl = Pphase  where  Pphase  is the \nphase power of a transformer.  Rm  is the mean diameter of the \nmain gap of the transformer. \n3 Meta-heuristic method\nThe modern interior-point method based GP solvers can \nbe applied to solve the transformer design optimization task, \nwhich guarantees that the obtained solution is the global opti -\nmum [17]. Moreover, even large scale geometric programs can \nbe solved extremely efficiently and reliably [18, 23]. However, \nthe description of this branch of mathematical optimization \nmethods is quite restrictive. The expressions of the equality \nand inequality constraints are prescribed to be special mathe -\nmatical formulae called monomials (Eq. (11)) and posynomials \n(Eq. (12)). Here  ck > 0  and the  α  parameters are real numbers. \nEvery  x  variable value has to be positive as well. \nmx cx xxgn\nn() =⋅ ⋅⋅ ⋅12\n12αα α\npx cx xxk\nk\nn\nk\nk\nK\nkn() =⋅ ⋅⋅ ⋅\n=\n∑ 12\n1\n1 2α α α\nBut as the authors have shown, this method cannot been \nused in the case of core-form transformers, where the short cir -\ncuit impedance is required [12, 20]. To solve this problem a \nmeta-heuristic algorithm was created along the lines of Branch \nand Bound search (BB). The BB executes a binary search in \nsense that the solution space is divided into several subspaces, \nwhich can be described in appropriate convex terms [12, 20]. \nThe BB can produce large number of sub-cases, but the BB \nis usually quite efficient in the practice because it employs \nadvanced techniques to remove certain parts of the search tree \nbefore evaluation. The general solution for core-form power \ntransformers are deeply described in [12].\n4 Evolutionary algorithms\nIn the optimization process, besides the brute force tech -\nnique and geometric programming, two different meta-heuris -\ntic procedures were considered as well, namely particle swam \noptimization (PSO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO). Such \ncomputational methods, regardless the problem on which they \nare applied, do not guarantee the globally optimal solution to be \nfound. In return, they provide the ability of much faster scan -\nning of large search spaces, which are not feasible to be sam -\npled completely and finely enough. On the other hand, since \nthey do not use the gradient of the problem as opposed to the \nclassic optimization methods, they do not require the problem \nto be differentiable.\n4.1 Particle swarm optimization\nParticle swarm optimization, first proposed by Ebenhard and \nKennedy [24], was intended to model social behaviour, e.g. in \na bird flock. The main idea is based on a so called swarm, an \ninitial population of candidate solutions, which are moved in \nthe search space during optimization, i.e., during the search \nfor the global extrema of a function  f :  n →   called the \ncost function in a search space  S Ì  n . Without the loss of \ngenerality let us confine ourselves to a minimization problem, \nwhen the goal is to find  a Î S  such that  \" b Î S , f (a) ≤ f (b) . \nLet  N  be the number of particles (candidate solutions) in the \nswarm and define  xi  and  vi  to be the position and the velocity \nof a particle in the search space, respectively, for  i = 1, …, N. \nMoreover, let  pi  denote the best known position of the  i th \nparticle and  g  the best known position of all the particles in \nthe swarm. Let us introduce three freely chosen scalar values,  \nω, φp  and  φg  controlling the efficiency and behaviour of the \noptimization process. On assigning an appropriate value to \nthese variables see [25] and [26]. The algorithm consists of the \nfollowing simple steps: \n1. Initialize the position  xi  of every particle in the swarm \nwith a uniformly distributed random vector from the \nsearch space  S, \n2. Initialize  pi ← xi , i = 1, …, N  and then  g  with the  pi  \nof the least cost, \n3. Initialize the components of every  vi  with a uniformly \ndistributed random values from  { vi, j | bl, j ≤ vi, j ≤ bu, j ,  \nj = 1, …, N }, where  bl  and  bu  are the lower and upper \nbounds of the search space, \n4. Do until iteration  M  is reached or termination criterion \nis met: \n• For every particle  i = 1, …, N , do: \n- For every dimensions  d = 1, …, n , do: \n* Pick random numbers  rp , rg  from  [0,1], \n* Update particle velocity:  xi ← xi + vi, \n- Update position  xi  of each particle by  xi ← xi + vi , \n- Update  pi  and  g  such that  vi, d ← ω vi, d + φp rp \n(pi, d − xi, d) + φg rg (gd − xi, d),\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n73\nPerformance Comparison 2017 61 1\nff\nff\nii ii\nii\n() ()\n() ()\nxp px\npg gp\n<← ,\n<← ,\n5. The most optimal solution found is contained in  g .\n4.2 Grey wolf optimization\nThe grey wolf optimization, proposed by Mirjalili et. al. \n[27], mimics the social characteristics in grey wolf packs and \nsimulates their hunting behavior. Similarly to PSO, GWO is \na swarm-based meta-heuristic. The population is divided into \nfour groups, referred to as alpha ( α), beta ( β), delta ( δ) and \nomega ( ω), respectively. The three best instances having the \nminimal fitness values are alpha, beta and delta in ascending \norder. The remaining instances are the omega, which during the \noptimization are re-positioned in the search space according to \nthe  α , β  and  δ . Let  X \n(i)\n  denote the position of a grey wolf in \nthe i th iteration, X p\ni()  the position of the prey in the  i th itera-\ntion and the operator ∙ element-wise multiplication between \nvectors of the same size. \nThe mathematical model of the encircling, a notable part in \nthe hunting process, can be described by the following formulas\nDC XX=⋅ −,p\nii() ()\nXX AD() ()i\np\ni+ =− ⋅,1\nwhere  A  and  C  are coefficient vectors, given by \nAa ra=⋅ −,2 1\nCr=,2 2\nwhere  r1 , r2  are random vectors with components from  [0,1] \nand  a  varies linearly from 2 to 0 according to iteration. \nSince the position  Xp  of the prey, the global optimum, is \nnot known, the   α , β  and  δ  wolves are assumed to have a bet-\nter knowledge about it. Consequently, the position of a wolf is \nupdated according to the following equation \nXX()i\nj\nj\n+\n=\n=, ∑\n1\n1\n31\n3\nwhere \nXX AD11=− ⋅,αα\nXX AD22=− ⋅,ββ\nXX AD33=− ⋅,δδ\nand\nDC XXαα =⋅ −,1\nDC XXββ =⋅ −,2\nDC XXδδ =⋅ −.3\nThe general steps of the GWO algorithm are the following: \n1. Initialize the pack of wolves randomly within the bounds \nof the search space, \n2. Do until iteration  M  is reached or termination criterion \nis met:\n(a) Calculate the value of the objective function for all \nthe wolves in the population, \n(b) Chose the three instances with the best objective \nvalue to be the  α , β  and the  δ , respectively, \n(c) Update the position of the  ω  wolves according to\n Eq. (17), \n(d) Update a , r1  and  r2 , \n3. The position of the  α  wolf is the best approximated op -\ntimum.\n5 Results and Discussion\n5.1 Test Case Transformer Specification\nThe above mentioned four optimization methods have been \ncompared regarding a three-phase, 80 MV A power transformer. \nFor this comparison two different sets of capitalisation factors \nhave been selected (k1 , k2 ) from [28]. Thereforethe value of the \nno-load loss capitalization is  k1 = 7000, the value of the load \nloss capitalization factor in €/kW  k2 = 1000 €/kW. The detailed \ndata-sheet with all of the required electrical and mechanical \nparameters are presented in Table 2. \nFor the sake of simplicity, the transformer cooling was cho -\nsen to be ONAN and the ambient temperature was specified to \n40 °C. The allowed winding oil temperature rise was defined to \nΘwo=65 K, according to the IEC-60076 standard [29]. There-\nfore a winding current density limit was set to  3 A / mm2  in the \nmain windings and  3.5 A / mm2  in the regulating winding. The \nwindings were modeled by their copper filling factors which \nfactors were based on the technology and the manufacturing \nexperience. \nThe applied core material in this case was a TRAN-COR \nH1 grade electrical steel [19]. The maximum of the flux den -\nsity was limited to 1.7 T considering the saturation of the core \nmaterial and the over-voltages in the power grid. \nThe minimal insulation distances were chosen by a priory  \nempirical rules [1, 21, 30, 31]. These methods were based on \nthe lightning impulse test and AC test requirements.\n5.2 Discussion of the Results\nTable 3  summarizes the optimal design variables which \nwere calculated by the four different optimization methods. \nThe value of the objective functions and the computational \nresource of the different methods can be compared. \nOne calculation step in the different algorithms has a simi -\nlar calculation effort. The MDM method which iterates over \nthe given set of variables is the slowest from the compared \n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n74\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng.

Fig. 3 shows the shape of the optimal TCO in \nthe function of the turn voltage, and illustrates the large amount \nof possible solutions. For this graph  n = 200000  is made, but \nas the results of Table 3 shows this algorithm haven’t found the \nglobal optimum as the meta-heuristic method. Because of the \nimproper discretization of the variable spaces.\nTable 2 List of the transformer model parameters.\nParameter Dimension Value\nNominal power M VA 80\nFrequency Hz 50\nConnection group YNd11\nNumber of phases # 3\nShort circuit impedance % 16.5\nMain gap mm 71\nSum of the end insulation distance mm 370\nLV side distance mm 155\nHV side distance mm 330\nPhase distance mm 71\nCore-Tank insulation top mm 60\nCore-Tank insulation bottom mm 90\nCore\nNumber of legs # 3\nFlux density limit T 1.73\nFilling Factor % 90\nMaterial Type 27H074\nMaterial Price €/kg 3\nLow V oltage \nWinding\nLine V oltage kV 33\nPhase V oltage kV 19.05\nPhase Current A 1399.64\nCopper filling factor % 70\nMaterial and \nmanufacturing price €/kg 8\nHigh V oltage \nWinding\nLine V oltage kV 225\nPhase V oltage kV 129.9\nPhase Current A 205.28\nBIL kV 1050\nAC kV 460\nCopper filling factor % 50\nMaterial and \nmanufacturing price €/kg 7\nRegulating \nWinding\nRegulating range % 15\nInsulation Fully insulated\nRegulated winding High voltage\nFilling factor % 70\nFig. 3 The optimal value of the TCO in the function of the turn voltages in the \ncase of the multi design optimization method.\nFig. 4 Average performance of the applied PSO and the GWO algorithms.\nTable 3 and Fig. 4  shows that the two evolutionary algo -\nrithm improves the convergence of the MDM significantly, \naccording to the literature [9, 32]. Fig. 4 shows that less than \n50 iterations are enough by the presented PSO or GWO based \nmethods to achieve the accuracy of the simple iteration based \nMDM method. Fig. 4 compares the average convergence rate \nof the two evolutionary algorithm based methods. This aver -\nage performance representation is made of 50 runs with linear \ntopology, in both cases. The GWO algorithm shows a greater \nconvergence rate than the PSO algorithm after few iterations, \nbut after 100 iterations no significant difference can be seen \nbetween the average performances ( Fig. 4). \nIn this case the meta-heuristic method has found the optimal \nsolution after only one iteration. Therefore, in this application \nthe meta-heuristic search is the fastest from the four compared \nalgorithms. But it should be noted that the convergence speed \nof the meta-heuristic method is depends on the value of the \nrequired SCI. As the previous study showed [12] if the opti -\nmal value of the SCI is lesser or equal to the requirement, only \none iteration can be enough otherwise it can be complicated. \nThe number of the iterations in this algorithm depends on the \ndistance between the optimal value of the impedance and the \n75\nPerformance Comparison 2017 61 1\nrequired SCI. If the optimal value of the SCI is lower than the \nrequired, the algorithm finds the global optimum in the first \nstep, but if the impedance is greater, about 100 iterations are \nenough to find an accurate solution. The value of the objec -\ntive function is significantly better in this case than in that of \nthe MDM method. The difference between the objectives is \nlesser than 1%, but the difference between the current densities \nis about 20% because of the non-linearity of the transformer \ndesign problem. In contrast to the PSO and GWO algorithms, \nno significant difference can be shown.\n6 Conclusion\nThe paper presents and compares the performance of four \ndifferent design optimization methods in the case of core-form \npower transformers. The MDM method can be implemented \nand applied easily, but it has a large computational require -\nment, and does not guarantee to find the global optimum of the \ntransformer optimization problem. The difference between the \nrelative values of the object functions are relatively small, but \nthe difference between the computational cost is significant. \nThe meta-heuristic algorithm which combines the geometric \nprogramming with the method of branch and bound gives more \naccurate results in much shorter time than any other examined \nmethod. The gray wolf optimization algorithm was applied \nsuccessfully for the transformer optimization problem, and has \na better performance for low iterations than the particle swarm \noptimization. By the application of these evolutionary strate -\ngies the performance of the MDM method can be improved \nsignificantly and can reach about the accuracy of the meta-\nheuristic method. \nReferences\n[1] Del Vecchio, R.
