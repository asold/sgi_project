Introduction\nAs the practical use of wide-band-gap switching devices,\nsuch as ones based on SiC and GaN, the e ﬃciency and\nswitching frequency of power-conversion systems utilizing\nthese devices have become higher. A solid-state transformer\n(SST) is one of the suitable power-conversion systems to\nwhich these devices are applied\n(1)–(3). Usually, an SST in-\ncludes an isolated DC /DC converter with a high-frequency\ntransformer driven at more than several kilohertz. This fre-\nquency range is signiﬁcantly higher than that at which a com-\nmercial transformer is driven, namely, 50 or 60 Hz. Since the\nvolume of a transformer reduces as the driving frequency be-\ncomes higher, the size and weight of the transformer can be\nreduced, thereby reducing the size and weight of the power-\nconversion system. Furthermore, as for an SST, the boost\nratio between input and output voltages can be changed by\ncontrolling the DC/DC converter. Accordingly, an SST is ex-\npected to be applied to next-generation power systems such\nas smart grids\n(4)–(7). Also, as mentioned above, SiC devices\nare suitable for application as SSTs. The frequency of SiC\ndevices can be made higher than that of conventional ones\nsuch as Si devices. Applying SiC devices to SSTs is thus\neﬀective for not only improving e ﬃciency but also reducing\nsize and weight of the system.\nRecently, a modular-multi-level converter (MMC) for ap-\nplication to a high-voltage and large-power-supply system\nhas been actively researched\n(8)–(10). An MMC consists of\na) Correspondence to: Mizuki Naka hara.

It outputs a multi-level voltage by controlling the out-\nput of each unit. As a result, a sinusoidal output voltage with\nfew harmonics can be generated. One of the features of an\nMMC is that it makes it possible to apply switching devices\nwith lower rated voltage than a conventional power converter\n(such as two- or three-level converters) because the series-\nconnected unit shares the output or input voltage. Since\nswitching devices with lower rated voltage are more com-\nmonly used for various applications, the cost of such devices\nis lower than those with higher rated voltage. For this rea-\nson, MMCs have the potential to reduce the cost of a power-\nconversion system compared to a conventional system using\nswitching devices with higher rated voltage.\nGiven the above-described situation, we have researched\na multi-level power converter consisting of SST units whose\ninputs are connected in parallel and outputs are connected in\nseries. A high-frequency (HF) transformer is implemented\nin each SST unit, and the input and output are insulated by\nthe HF transformer. It is therefore possible to attain both a\ncompact and lightweight system and insulation between the\ninput and output. We previously applied a multi-level con-\nverter with multiple SST units to a power-conditioning sys-\ntem (PCS) for PV generation (PV-PCS). Each SST unit has\nan LLC converter as the isolated DC/DC converter. The LLC\nconverter has both the high e ﬃciency and low noise charac-\nteristics. Therefore, the size of each SST unit can be made\nsmall. However, as one of the features of the LLC con-\nverter, the controllable voltage range with high e ﬃciency is\nnarrow\n(11). In the case of PV-PCS, the input voltage ﬂuctu-\nates depending on the weather and time. Therefore, the wide\ncontrollable voltage range is needed to each SST unit.\nc⃝2019 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. 652\nDevelopment of LLC Converter for Input-Parallel-Output-Series Inverter SystemʢMizuki Nakahara et al.ʣ\n(a) Conventional PV system\n(b) Proposed PV system (multi-level converter)\nFig. 1. Conﬁguration comparison of PV-PCSs\nIn this paper, ﬁrst of all, a concept of the multi-level con-\nverter assuming PV-PCS is described. Then, the control\nmethod which can satisfy with the wide controllable voltage\nrange with high eﬃciency of an LLC converter is described.\n2. Multi-level Converter with SST Units for PV-\nPCS\nThe system conﬁguration of the developed multi-level con-\nverter for PV-PCS, as well as the circuit conﬁguration and\nstructure of the SST unit for PV-PCS, are described below.\n2.1 Circuit Conﬁguration of Developed Multi-level\nConverter for PV-PCS In a PV-PCS, a converter re-\nceives DC power generated by PV panels. The PCS controls\nthe DC voltage of the PV panels in order to maximize the\ngenerated power from the PV panels using a method called\n“maximum power point tracking (MPPT)”. Fig. 1(a) shows a\nconventional PV system. Each PV panel has a PCS, and its\noutput is a three-phase AC voltage of several-hundred volts.\nThen, in the case of a PCS with a conventional converter,\nthe three-phase AC voltage is boosted up to several kilovolts\nwith a commercial sub-transformer connected to a commer-\ncial main transformer. These transformers are driven at 50\nor 60 Hz. Therefore, in the power-conversion system, the\nsize of these transformers are dominant. On the other hand,\nin the case of the developed multi-level converter shown in\nFig. 1(b), the DC power is directly converted to several kilo-\nvolts AC without using the sub-transformer. Therefore, the\nspace and cost can be saved with the developed converter.\nThe system conﬁguration of the developed converter for a\nPV-PCS is shown in Fig. 2. The voltage range of the DC input\nfrom the PV panels is assumed to be up to 600 V . Also, the\nvoltage range of the AC output is assumed to be 6.6 kVrms.\nTherefore, in the case of the developed converter, the in-\nputs of the SST units are connected in parallel and the out-\nputs are connected in series. Each SST unit consists of a\nlow-voltage side (input side), high-voltage side (output side),\nand a DC/DC converter. The output voltage is boosted, and\nFig. 2. Detailed system c onﬁguration of the proposed\nmulti-level converter for PV-PCS\nthe insulation is provided without using a commercial trans-\nformer because each SST unit has an HF transformer driven\nat more than several kilohertz—which is several-hundred-\ntimes faster than that of a commercial transformer. The size\nof a transformer is generally decreased by making the driving\nfrequency high. Therefore, the size of the developed multi-\nlevel converter can be much smaller than that of a conven-\ntional system with a commercial transformer. Furthermore,\nthanks to the multi-level voltage output, the output ﬁlter can\nalso be smaller.\n2.2 Circuit Conﬁguration and Structure of SST Unit\nIn an SST unit, an LLC converter is used as an iso-\nlated DC/DC converter. By applying the LLC converter, the\nswitching losses of the switching devices on the low-voltage\nside can be reduced because the turn-oﬀcurrent can be made\nsmall due to current resonance caused by the magnetizing\ninductance of the transformer ( L\nm), the leakage inductance\nof the transformer ( Lr), and the capacitance of the capacitor\n(Cr). Soft turn-on switching is also made possible with the\nLLC converter. Therefore, higher switching frequency, along\nwith high conversion eﬃciency of the LLC converter, can be\nattained\n(12) (13). In the case of the circuit conﬁguration shown\nin Fig. 2, the maximum voltage di ﬀerence between the low-\nvoltage side (LV side) and the high-voltage side (HV side)\nis obtained by adding the DC voltage on the LV side to the\npeak phase voltage on the HV side, which corresponds to a\ntotal voltage of about 6.6 kV . Therefore, the performance of\nthe insulation between the LV and HV sides in each SST unit\nshould be enough to withstand 6.6 kV . Furthermore, because\nof the voltage diﬀerence between the LV and HV sides, cool-\ning of the devices is challenging. The devices which need\nfor cooling are on both the LV and HV sides. As mentioned,\nthe insulation between the LV and HV sides are necessary.\nTherefore, the cooling design which satisfy the performance\n653 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.8, No.4, 2019\nDevelopment of LLC Converter for Input-Parallel-Output-Series Inverter SystemʢMizuki Nakahara et al.ʣ\nFig. 3. Appearance of prototype SST unit\nFig. 4. Schematic view of the s ectional structure of the\nSST unit\nTable 1. Speciﬁcations of the developed system and\nSST unit\nof the insulation is needed.\nThe appearance of a prototype SST unit is shown in Fig. 3,\nand a schematic view of the sectional structure of the SST\nunit (as seen from the X-axis direction) is shown in Fig. 4.\nThe prototype has two printed circuit boards (PCBs). The\nlower one is for the LV side, and the upper one is for the HV\nside. The cooling ﬁns are equipped in the space between the\ntwo PCBs. In this prototype, cooling is provided by forced\nair. As shown in Fig. 4, air ﬂows from the left side of the SST\nunit into the space between the two PCBs. By applying this\nstructure, the devices on both the HV and LV sides can be\ncooled while ensuring good insulation performance because\nthe distance between the cooling ﬁn on the LV side and that\non the HV side is designed enough to withstand the voltage\nstress of 6.6 kV . As a result, the SST unit can be miniaturized,\nand it can be eﬃciently cooled. The speciﬁcations of the de-\nveloped system and SST units are listed in Table 1. The rated\npower is 300 kW, and 8 SST units are connected per phase\n(totaling 24 units in the whole system). Therefore, the output\nof each SST unit is under 1 kV , which means the switching\ndevices whose rated voltage is 1.2 kV can be used. The rated\npower of the SST unit is 12.5 kW. In the LLC converter in the\nSST unit, 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFETs are used for the switching\nFig. 5. Circuit schematic of an LLC converter\ndevices, and SiC-SBDs are used for the rectiﬁer on the HV\nside.\n3. High-eﬃciency Control of LLC Converter\nA control method for highly e ﬃciently driving the devel-\noped converter for PV-PCS—from the viewpoint of operation\nof the LLC converter—is described below.\n3.1 Operation Modes of LLC Converter Each SST\nunit has an LLC converter, which controls DC link voltage\non the HV side. The circuit of an LLC converter is shown\nschematically in Fig. 5. Generally, the LLC converter con-\ntrols the output voltage by means of changing switching fre-\nquency F\nsw of Q1 to Q4, and the operation mode of the LLC\nconverter depends on the relationship between Fsw and reso-\nnance frequency Fr. It is commonly known that an LLC con-\nverter has two resonance frequencies. Hereafter, the higher\nresonance frequency is focused on and taken as Fr,w h i c hi s\ngiven as\nFr ≃ 1\n2π√\nLrCr\n,································· (1)\nwhere Lr is the leakage inductance of an HF transformer, and\nCr is the capacitance of a capacitor connected to the wind-\nings of the HF transformer in series. The operation mode\nof an LLC converter varies according to F\nsw. Waveforms of\ngate-source voltage vgs of Q1 to Q4, current of Q1 iq1,a n dt h e\ncurrent of the LV-side windings of the HF transformer itr in\neach operation mode are shown in Fig. 6. In this LLC con-\nverter, one pair of switches (Q\n1 and Q4) and the other pair\n(Q2 and Q 3) are turned on or o ﬀcomplementarily. When\nFsw < Fr, the output voltage (i.e., DC link voltage on the\nHV side) is boosted from the voltage determined by the turn\nratio of the HF transformer (i.e., boost mode). In this mode,\nthe switches are turned oﬀafter the load current ﬂowing into\nthe HV side becomes zero. Therefore, the turn-o ﬀcurrent of\nthe switches (which corresponds to the magnetizing current\nof the HF transformer) becomes lower than the peak value.\nAs a result, the switching losses can be suppressed. How-\never, in boost mode, the peak current becomes larger than\nthat in other modes; therefore, the conduction losses become\nlarger than that in other modes. When F\nsw ≃Fr, DC link\nvoltage on the HV side is determined by the turn ratio of the\nHF transformer (i.e., resonance mode). In other words, the\nvoltage-boost ratio becomes one. In this mode, the switches\nare turned o ﬀwhen the load current becomes zero. There-\nfore, switching losses of the switches can be suppressed in the\nsame manner as in boost mode. Furthermore, the peak cur-\nrent becomes lower than that in boost mode. Therefore, the\nconduction losses can also be suppressed, thereby increasing\neﬃciency. When F\nsw >Fr, DC link voltage is stepped down\nfrom that determined by the turn ratio of the HF transformer\n654 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.8, No.4, 2019\nDevelopment of LLC Converter for Input-Parallel-Output-Series Inverter SystemʢMizuki Nakahara et al.ʣ\n(a) Boost mode (voltage boosting ratio is over 1)\n(b) Resonance mode (voltage boosting ratio is 1)\n(c) Buck mode (voltage boosting ratio is under 1)\nFig. 6. Operation modes of the LLC converter\n(i.e., buck mode). In this mode, the switches are turned o ﬀ\nbefore the load current reaches zero. Therefore, the turn-o ﬀ\ncurrent becomes larger than that in other modes, resulting in\nlarger switching losses than those in other modes. As ex-\nplained above, the e ﬃciency of the LLC converter becomes\nhigh when the LLC converter operates in resonance mode; on\nthe other hand, if it operates in boost and buck modes, the ef-\nﬁciency decreases. Therefore, to apply the LLC converter to\na PV-PCS, the high-eﬃciency operation of the LLC converter\nbecomes a problem because the input voltage may ﬂuctuate\nwith time or weather, meaning the voltage-boost ratio always\nchanges.\n3.2 Cooperative Control of DC Link Voltage for LLC\nConverter As a solution to the problem described in Sec-\ntion 3.1, a method to cooperatively control DC link voltage\n(and thus enhance e ﬃciency compared to the conventional\ncontrol method) is proposed. For example, in the case of the\nconventional method, if the input voltage is high, the LLC\nconverter operates in buck mode, resulting in low e ﬃciency\nFig. 7. Relationship between input voltage and DC link\nvoltage when the conventional control method is applied\nFig. 8. Relationship between input voltage and DC link\nvoltage when the proposed control method is applied\nbecause of large switching losses. On the other hand, in the\ncase of the proposed method, the voltage-boost ratio between\nthe input and output voltages (DC link voltage) is kept to 1\nin a certain input-voltage range. As a result, DC link voltage\nchanges according to the input voltage. By adopting the pro-\nposed method, the LLC converter can operate in resonance\nmode in a wider input-voltage range than that possible with\nthe conventional method. As a result, it is possible to en-\nhance the eﬃciency of the LLC converter. The relationships\nbetween input voltage and DC link voltage in the case of ap-\nplying the conventional and proposed methods are shown in\nFigs. 7 and 8, respectively. In the case of the conventional\nmethod shown in Fig. 7, DC link voltage is kept constant in\nany input voltage. Therefore, the high-eﬃciency operation of\nthe LLC converter can only be achieved near the resonance\npoint, which is a small part of the MPPT range. On the other\nhand, in the case of the proposed method shown in Fig. 8,\nDC link voltage is changed according to the input voltage. In\ndetail, DC link voltage is controlled so that DC link voltage\nis proportional to the input voltage when the input voltage\nbecomes over certain value. The value means the voltage\nthat the voltage boosting ratio becomes 1 with considering\nthe turn ratio of an HF transformer. Therefore, by applying\nthe proposed method, the LLC converter can keep operating\nwith the voltage-boost ratio of 1. In other words, the LLC\nconverter can operate in the resonance mode over the wide\nvoltage range, resulting in high-e ﬃciency operation of the\nLLC converter. In Fig. 8, DC link voltage is proportional to\nthe input voltage from 640 V to 720 V . The minimum value of\n640 V is determined by the limitation of the modulation rate\nof the inverter in each SST unit. Furthermore, the maximum\nvoltage of 720 V is determined by the rated voltage of DC\n655 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.8, No.4, 2019\nDevelopment of LLC Converter for Input-Parallel-Output-Series Inverter SystemʢMizuki Nakahara et al.ʣ\nTable 2. Parameters of LLC converter in prototype SST\nunit\nTable 3. Loss analysis conditions\nlink capacitors (800 V). Incidentally, the eﬀect to the inverter\nloss is quite small by using the proposed method because of\nchanging DC link voltage. The inverter output of each SST\nunit is connected in series (in this case, 8 units), which means\nthat switching frequency of each inverter doesn’t have to set\nhigh (for example, several hundreds Hz). Therefore, the in-\ncrease of the switching loss is few.\n4. Evaluation of Prototype SST Unit\nTo evaluate the proposed method, a prototype SST unit\nshown in Fig. 3 was designed and implemented. The cir-\ncuit parameter is shown in Table 2. Firstly, the LLC con-\nverter losses in the case of the conventional and the pro-\nposed method are compared analytically. Secondary, the ex-\nperimental evaluations are implemented. The measured e ﬃ-\nciency according to the load characteristics under two input\nvoltages are presented.\n4.1 LLC Converter Loss Analysis Firstly, in order\nto evaluate the proposed method, the LLC converter losses\nare analyzed under the rated load condition. The analysis\nconditions are shown in Table 3. Under the conventional\ncondition, DC link voltage is controlled of 640 V at the in-\nput voltage of 500 V . On the other hand, under the proposed\ncondition, DC link voltage is controlled of 720 V at the same\ninput voltage as the conventional condition. Furthermore,\nthe output power is 12.5 kW (rated load) in both conditions.\nThe circuit parameters are assumed as the prototype SST unit\nshown in Table 2. In this analysis, the current values such as\nthe turn-oﬀcurrent which is needed for the loss calculation\nare estimated by the circuit simulation.\nFigure 9 shows the loss calculation results. In the case of\nthe conventional condition, the switching loss is dominant in\nthe total loss. In this case, the LLC converter operates in the\nbuck mode, which results in large turn-o ﬀcurrent. This is\nthe reason why the switching loss becomes dominant. On\nthe other hand, in the case proposed condition, the switching\nloss becomes smaller than that of the conventional. This is\nbecause the LLC converter can operate in the resonant mode,\nwhich results in the lower turn-oﬀcurrent. As a result, the to-\ntal loss decreases by 13.3% by the proposed method. There-\nfore, the validity of the proposed method is conﬁrmed analyt-\nically.\nFig. 9. Analysis results of LLC converter losses\nFig. 10. Experimental conﬁguration of LLC converter\nTable 4. Experimental conditions (half voltage condi-\ntions)\n4.2 Experimental Conditions Figure 10 shows the\nexperimental conﬁguration. A DC electronic load is used as\nthe resistance load, and a power analyzer which has multiple\nchannels is used for measuring the input and output power to\ncalculate the eﬃciency. In the experiments, two voltage con-\nditions are considered. The experimental conditions are listed\nin Table 4. As for condition 1, input voltage was 250 V , and\nDC link voltage was 360 V . As for condition 2, input voltage\nwas 200 V , which was 50 V (20%) lower than that in condi-\ntion 1, and DC link voltage was 320 V . Thus, DC link voltage\nwas changed according to input voltage. In these conditions,\ninput voltage and DC link voltage were set to about half of\nthe rated voltage because of the limitation of the experimen-\ntal equipment. Under these conditions, the e ﬃciency of the\nprototype SST unit was measured by varying the load factor\nfrom 5% to 100%. Moreover, to conﬁrm the validity of the\nexperiments under the half-voltage condition, the experiment\nwas also performed under the rated-voltage condition. In that\nexperiment, input voltage was 475 V , and DC link voltage\nwas 640 V . Also, in the experiments, the eﬃciency was mea-\nsured by varying the load factor from 5% (625 W) to 100%\n(12.5 kW).\n4.3 Experimental Results The waveforms of each\nvoltage and current when the load factor is 100% under con-\nd i t i o n s1a n d2a r es h o w ni nF i g .1 1 .v\ngs, vtr,a n dvds are the\nvoltages between the gate and source of an SiC-MOSFET,\nbetween the terminals of the HF transformer on the LV side,\nand between the drain and source of the SiC-MOSFET, re-\nspectively, and i\ntr is the current of the HF transformer on the\nLV side.

Therefore, the turn-o ﬀcurrent is lower than\nthe peak, resulting in high-e ﬃciency operation. It is clear\nfrom Fig. 11(b) that itr also becomes sinusoidal; however,\nthe period in which the magnetizing current ﬂows is slightly\nlonger than that under condition 1. This result means that\nthe LLC converter operates in so-called “light” boost mode.\nTherefore, as under condition 1, turn-oﬀcurrent is lower than\nthe peak. Furthermore, the experimental waveforms under\nthe rated voltage condition are shown in Fig. 12. The current\nof Q\n1 iq1 is shown instead of vtr. From the waveforms, itr\nbecomes also sinusoidal in the same manner as under condi-\ntion 1. The measured e ﬃciencies under conditions 1 and 2\nFig. 13.

It is clear that the measured e ﬃcien-\ncies at a load factor of 100% under conditions 1 and 2 are\nover 98%. Moreover, even at load factor of 10%, the eﬃcien-\ncies are over 94%. Under condition 1, maximum e ﬃciency\nis 98.3% at load factor of 70%. As mentioned above, the ef-\nﬁciency under condition 1 is almost the same as that under\ncondition 2. This means that the high e ﬃciency operation\ncan be kept even if the input voltage changes by the proposed\nmethod. Therefore, the validity of the proposed method was\nexperimentally conﬁrmed. Additionally, the measured e ﬃ-\nciency under the rated-voltage condition is shown in Fig. 14.\nThe maximum eﬃciency is 98.4% at road factor of 70%, and\nthat at load factor of 100% (12.5 kW) is 98.3%. Moreover,\neﬃciency at load factor of 10% is over 94%. It is concluded\nfrom these results that the experimental results under the half-\nvoltage condition can be used instead of those obtained under\nthe rated voltage condition. Furthermore, the loss calculation\nresults shown in Fig. 9 and the measured loss are compared\nin Fig. 15. The both results correspond well, and the error\nis only 3.7%. Therefore, the validity of the loss calculation\nresults is also conﬁrmed.\n5.
