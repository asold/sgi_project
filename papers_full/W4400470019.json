  "abstract": "Conventional tutoring approaches are confronted with limitations such as restricted availability, inconsistent pedagogical quality, and scalability con-straints. Furthermore, the exclusive use of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in education has its shortcomings, including the potential for incorrect responses and the lack of customized guidance aligned with specific course con-tent. This research proposes an innovative intelligent chatbot tutoring system, in-tegrating the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with a custom LLM. The developed system aims to overcome the limitations of traditional tu-toring and general-purpose LLMs by providing accurate, contextually relevant, and personalized assistance, thereby enhancing student understanding and en-gagement. The system, powered by an intelligent agent, retrieves relevant information from curated academic sources, incorporates interactive features for user feedback, and utilizes machine learning algorithms for ongoing performance enhancement, ensuring a robust and effective tutoring experience. The anticipated outcome is an enriched educational experience for university students, advance-ment in personalized learning, and improved student engagement, retention, and academic performance. Through continuous research and refinement, it is expected that the intelligent chatbot tutor will assume an important role in enhancing and supporting the educational journey of students.",
