However, these features are ob-\ntained via open-domain toolkits that are dialog-\nagnostic or heavily relied on human annota-\ntions. In this paper, we show how DialoGPT\n(Zhang et al., 2020b), a pre-trained model for\nconversational response generation, can be de-\nveloped as an unsupervised dialogue annotator,\nwhich takes advantage of dialogue background\nknowledge encoded in DialoGPT. We apply\nDialoGPT to label three types of features on\ntwo dialogue summarization datasets, SAM-\nSum and AMI, and employ pre-trained and\nnon pre-trained models as our summarizers.\nExperimental results show that our proposed\nmethod can obtain remarkable improvements\non both datasets and achieves new state-of-the-\nart performance on the SAMSum dataset1.\n1 Introduction\nDialogue summarization aims to generate a suc-\ncinct summary while retaining essential informa-\ntion of the dialogue (Gurevych and Strube, 2004;\nChen and Yang, 2020). Theoretically, Peyrard\n(2019) point out that a good summary is intuitively\nrelated to three aspects, including Informativeness,\nRedundancy and Relevance.\nTo this end, previous works have taken the above\nthree aspects into account by incorporating auxil-\niary annotations into the dialogue. To improve\ninformativeness, some works annotated linguisti-\ncally speciﬁc words (e.g., nouns and verbs), do-\nmain terminologies and topic words in the dialogue\n(Riedhammer et al., 2008; Koay et al., 2020; Zhao\net al., 2020). To reduce redundancy, some works\n∗Corresponding author.\n1Our codes are available at: https://github.com/\nxcfcode/PLM_annotator\nused sentence similarity-based methods to anno-\ntate redundant utterances. (Zechner, 2002; Murray\net al., 2005). To improve relevance, some works\nannotated topics for the dialogue (Li et al., 2019;\nLiu et al., 2019; Chen and Yang, 2020). How-\never, these annotations are usually obtained via\nopen-domain toolkits, which are not suitable for\ndialogues, or require manual annotations, which\nare labor-consuming.\nTo alleviate the above problem, we explore the\npre-trained language model as an unsupervised an-\nnotator to automatically provide annotations for the\ndialogue. Recently, some works have investigated\nthe use of pre-trained language models in an unsu-\npervised manner. For example, Sainz and Rigau\n(2021) exploited pre-trained models for assigning\ndomain labels to WordNet synsets. The successful\nrecipe is that a model is obtained extensive knowl-\nedge via pre-training on a huge volume of data.\nWhen it comes to the dialogue domain, DialoGPT\n(Zhang et al., 2020b) is a SOTA conversational\nresponse generation model, which is pre-trained\non the massive dialogue data. Therefore, we draw\nsupport from DialoGPT and present our DialoGPT\nannotator, which can perform three dialogue anno-\ntation tasks, including keywords extraction, redun-\ndancy detection and topic segmentation, to measure\ninformativeness, redundancy and relevance of the\ninput dialogue, respectively.\nKeywords Extraction aims to automatically\nidentify important words in the dialogue (shown\nin Figure 1(a)). Our DialoGPT annotator extracts\nunpredictable words as keywords. We assume that\nkeywords contain high information, which are dif-\nﬁcult to be predicted considering both background\nknowledge encoded in the DialoGPT and contex-\ntual information of dialogue context. Redundancy\nDetection aims to detect redundant utterances that\nhave no core contribution to the overall meaning of\nthe dialogue (shown in Figure 1(b)).

(c) Topic segmentation aims to divide the whole dialogue into several\nﬁne-grained topics. All three auxiliary information can do good to ﬁnal summary generation.\nannotator detects utterances that are useless for di-\nalogue context representation as redundant. We\nassume that if adding a new utterance does not\nchange the dialogue context representation, then\nthis utterance has no effect on predicting the re-\nsponse, so it is redundant. Topic Segmentation\naims to divide a dialogue into topically coherent\nsegments (shown in Figure 1(c)). Our DialoGPT\nannotator inserts a topic segmentation point before\none utterance if it is unpredictable. We assume that\nif an utterance is difﬁcult to be inferred from the\ndialogue context based on DialoGPT, this utterance\nmay belong to a new topic.\nWe use our DialoGPT annotator to annotate the\nSAMSum (Gliwa et al., 2019) and AMI (Carletta\net al., 2005) datasets. Each annotation is converted\ninto a speciﬁc identiﬁer and we insert them into the\ndialogue text. Then, we employ pre-traind BART\n(Lewis et al., 2020) and non pre-trained PGN (See\net al., 2017) as our summarizers. Extensive experi-\nmental results show that our method can obtain con-\nsistent and remarkable improvements over strong\nbaselines on both datasets and achieves new state-\nof-the-art performance on the SAMSum dataset.\n2 Preliminaries\nIn this section, we will describe the task deﬁnition\nas well as the background of DialoGPT.\n2.1 Task Deﬁnition\nGiven an input dialogue D, a dialogue summa-\nrizer aims to produce a condensed summary S,\nwhere Dconsists of |D|utterances [u1,u2,...u|D|]\nand Sconsists of |S|words [s1,s2,...s|S|]. Each\nutterance ui is compose of a sequence of words\n[ui,1,ui,2,...ui,|ui|,EOSi], where i ∈ [1 : |D|]\nand EOSi indicates the end of the utterance. Be-\nsides, each utterance ui associates with a speaker\npi. Thus, this task can be formalized as producing\nthe summary Sgiven the dialogue sequence: D=\n[p1,u1,1,..., EOS1,...,p |D|,u|D|,1,..., EOS|D|]\n2.2 DialoGPT\nDialoGPT (Zhang et al., 2020b) is a neural con-\nversational response generation model, which in-\nherits from GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and is\ntrained on 147M conversation-like exchanges ex-\ntracted from Reddit comment chains. There are\n3 different sizes of the model with total parame-\nters of 117M, 345M and 762M respectively. It\nachieves state-of-the-art results over various dia-\nlogue generation benchmarks. Given the dialogue\ncontext ui−1 = [ui−1,1,...,u i−1,|ui−1|,EOSi−1],\nDialoGPT aims to produce the response ui =\n[ui,1,...,u i,|ui|,EOSi], which can be formalized as\nthe conditional probability of P(ui|ui−1). It ﬁrst\ntakes the context word sequence of no more than\n1024 tokens and outputs the representation of the se-\nquence hi = (hi−1,1,..., hi−1,|ui−1|,hi−1,EOSi−1 ),\nwhere hi−1,EOSi−1 can be viewed as the repre-\nsentation of dialogue context ui−1. Then, Di-\naloGPT starts decoding the response by attend-\ning to the context token representations and par-\ntially decoded response tokens until reaching EOS.\nThe loss function is the negative log-likelihood\nof the response word sequence LDialoGPT =\n−∑|ui|\nt=1 log p(ui,t|ui,1 ...u i,t−1,ui−1). It’s worth\nnoting that DialoGPT tokenizes texts with the same\nbyte-pair encoding as GPT-2, thus either context or\nresponse tokens are tokenized into subwords.\n1481\nContext:yooguys.EOS1Response: hey wassup.

(I) Given one dialogue, we preprocess it into two formats:\ncontext-response pairs and the dialogue sequence. (II) We input them into the DialoGPT, after the forward pass,\nwe can get the word-level and utterance-level predicted losses and representations for dialogue context. (III) We\nperform three annotation tasks: keywords extraction, redundancy detection and topic segmentation. Finally, we\ncan get a labelled dialogue. #KEY#, [RD] and [TS] are speciﬁc tags, which are inserted into the dialogue.\n3 Method\nIn this section, we will ﬁrst introduce our DialoGPT\nannotator. The workﬂow consists of three steps\n(1) dialogue preprocessing; (2) DialoGPT forward\npassing; (3) annotation. The overall framework\nis shown in Figure 2. Then, we will describe our\ndialogue summarizer, including BART and PGN.\n3.1 Dialogue Preprocessing\nDialogue preprocessing aims to trans-\nform the original dialogue D =\n[p1,u1,1,..., EOS1,...,p |D|,u|D|,1,..., EOS|D|]\ninto the format that DialoGPT can process.\nSpeciﬁcally, we transform it into two formats.\nThe ﬁrst one is context-response pairs (shown in\nFigure 2(a)). Given a dialogue D, two adjacent\nutterances (ui−1,ui) are combined into a context-\nresponse pair, where i∈[2 :|D|] . The second one\nis dialogue sequence (shown in Figure 2(b)). All\nthe utterances in the dialogue Dare serialized into\na sequence [u1,1,..., EOS1,...,u |D|,1,..., EOS|D|],\nwith EOS separates each utterance.\nNote that either for context-response pairs or the\ndialogue sequence, we do not take speaker infor-\nmation p into consideration. The reason is that\nDialoGPT is trained on a huge volume of conver-\nsational data without speaker information. Even\nso, Zhang et al. (2020b) proved that DialoGPT can\nsimulate real-world dialogues in various scenes and\nhas already learned diverse response generation\npatterns between the same speakers or different\nspeakers according to the given context.\n3.2 DialoGPT Forward Passing\nDialoGPT forward passing has two purposes. (1)\nFor each context-response pair, we aim to get the\nword-level and utterance-level predicted losses for\nthe response (shown in Figure 2(c)). (2) For the di-\nalogue sequence, we aim to get the representations\nfor each EOS (shown in Figure 2(d)).\nFor the ﬁrst purpose, given one context-response\npair (ui−1,ui), we input the context words ui−1 =\n[ui−1,1,ui−1,2,...,u i−1,|ui−1|,EOSi−1] into the Di-\naloGPT and start to decode the response. At\neach decode step t, we calculate the negative log-\nlikelihood between the predicted distribution and\nthe golden target from the given response.\nlossi,t = −log p(ui,t|ui,<t,ui−1)\nlossi = 1\n|ui|+ 1\n|ui|+1∑\nt=1\nlossi,t\n(1)\nwhere lossi,t and lossi are the predicted losses for\neach word and each utterance respectively2.\nFor the second purpose, after the single forward\npass of DialoGPT over the dialogue sequence, we\ncan get representations H for each token on the\ntop of the DialoGPT. Afterward, we extract all\nrepresentations for each EOS.\nhEOS1 ,hEOS2 ,..., hEOS|D| = H (EOS) (2)\nwhere each hEOSi can be viewed as the representa-\ntion for the dialogue context [u1,...,u i].\n2Note that DialoGPT uses BPE to tokenize texts, thus,\nlosses are calculated at the sub-word level. We recover the\nword-level predicted loss by averaging the losses of multiple\nsub-words. Besides, since the ﬁrst utterance u1 can only be\nserved as the context, so we do not compute loss for u1.\n1482\nFigure 3: Illustration of redundancy detection process.\nThe initial redundant utterances set is ∅. hEOSi is the\nrepresentation for dialogue context covering the ﬁrst i\nutterances. We detect redundant utterances based on\nthe cosine similarity between representations of dia-\nlogue context. For example, the similarity score be-\ntween hEOS4 and hEOS5 exceeds the pre-deﬁned thresh-\nold (tRD is 0.99), which means adding utteranceu5 into\nthe dialogue context brings little information, thus the\nutterance u5 is detected as redundant.\n3.3 Annotation\n3.3.1 Keywords Extraction: DialoGPT KE\nMotivation Considering both background knowl-\nedge encoded in the DialoGPT and contextual in-\nformation of the dialogue context, if one word in\nthe golden response is difﬁcult to be inferred from\nDialoGPT, we assume that it contains high infor-\nmation and can be viewed as a keyword.\nGiven a dialogue D, we have loss lossi,j for\neach word ui,j, where i ∈[2 : |D|]. We extract\nrKE percent of words with the highest loss as key-\nwords, where rKE is a hyper-parameter 3. More-\nover, the names of all speakers P mentioned in\nthe dialogue are also added into the keywords set.\nFinally, we append a speciﬁc tag #KEY# and the\nkeywords to the end of the original dialogue D.\nThe new dialogue with keywords annotation is\nDKE = [p1,u1,1,...,  \nD\n#KEY#,P,Key1,Key2,...  \nkeywords\n].4\n3We use a heuristic rule to predetermine the possible value\nof rKE by calculating the average of length of summaries\n(remove stopwords) divided by the length of dialogues in the\ntrain set. We search the best rKE based on the calculated score.\n4In experiments, we ﬁnd that the predicted loss for the ﬁrst\nword of each utterance is extremely high, probably due to the\nﬁrst word in the response is the most uncertain and hard to be\npredicted. Thus, we ignore the ﬁrst word of each utterance.\n3.3.2 Redundancy Detection: DialoGPT RD\nMotivation DialoGPT inherits a decoder archi-\ntecture, where one token attends to all previous\ntokens to aggregate information. Thus, given\nthe representation hEOSi for each EOSi, it can be\nviewed as the representation for the dialogue con-\ntext [u1,u2,...,u i]. Adding a new utterance ui+1,\nif the new context representation hEOSi+1 is simi-\nlar to the previous hEOSi , we assume that the new\nutterance ui+1 brings little information and has\nsmall effects on predicting the response, thus ui+1\nbecomes a redundant utterance.\nWe start with the last two dialogue context repre-\nsentations hEOS|D|−1 and hEOS|D|, and calculate the\ncosine similarity between them. If the similarity\nscore exceeds the threshold tRD, the utterance u|D|\nis detected as redundant. tRD is a hyper-parameter.\nIf the similarity score doesn’t exceed the threshold\ntRD, we move forward one step to calculate the\nsimilarity between hEOS|D|−2 and hEOS|D|−1 , and\nrepeat the process until reaching hEOS1 . An exam-\nple is shown in Figure 3.\nWe insert a speciﬁc tag [RD] before each\nredundant utterance. For example, if utter-\nance u1 is redundant, the new dialogue with\nredundant utterances annotation is DRD =\n[p1,[RD],u1,1,..., EOS1,...,p |D|,..., EOS|D|].\n3.3.3 Topic Segmentation: DialoGPT TS\nMotivation DialoGPT is skilled in generating the\ncontext-consistent response. Therefore, if the re-\nsponse is difﬁcult to be predicted given the context\nbased on DialoGPT, we assume the response may\nbelong to another topic and there is a topic segmen-\ntation between the context and response.\nGiven a dialogue D, we have loss lossi for each\nutterance ui, where i ∈[2 : |D|]. We select rTS\npercent of utterances with the highest loss as topic\nsegmentation points. rTS is a hyper-parameter 5.\nBefore each selected utterance, we insert a speciﬁc\ntag [TS]. For example, if there is a segmenta-\ntion point between utterance u1 and utterance u2,\nthe new dialogue with topic annotation is DTS =\n[p1,u1,1,..., EOS1,[TS],p2,u2,1,..., EOS2,...].\n5We use a heuristic rule to predetermine the possible value\nof rTS by calculating the average of the number of summary\nsentences divided by the number of dialogue utterances in the\ntrain set. This is based on the observation that each sentence\nin golden summary tends to correspond to one topic of the\ndialogue. We search the bestrTS based on the calculated score.\n1483\n3.4 Summarizer\nWe employ two kinds of summarizer, one isBART\n(Lewis et al., 2020), which is a Transformer-based\nmodel and pre-trained on a huge volume of data.\nThe other one is PGN (See et al., 2017), which is\na LSTM-based model. Both models inherit a typi-\ncal sequence-to-sequence framework, which ﬁrst\nencodes the source dialogue Dto distributed repre-\nsentations and then generates the target summary\nSwith the decoder.\nBART BART adopts the Transformer (Vaswani\net al., 2017) as the backbone architecture. It ﬁrst\nmap the source dialogue into distributed represen-\ntations, based on which a decoder generates the\ntarget sequence:\nXN = ENCODER (X0)\nN\n:=\nn=1\nFFN\n(\nATT(Xn−1)\n)\nY M = DECODER (Y 0,XN)\nM\n:=\nm=1\nFFN\n(\nATT\n(\nATT(Y m−1),XN))\n(3)\nwhere\nN\n:=\nn=1\ndenotes N identical encoding layers,\nM\n:=\nm=1\ndenotes M identical decoding layers, X0 de-\nnotes the sum of the word embeddings Xemb and\nposition embeddings Xpos of D, Y 0 denotes that\nof the shifted right S, FFN(·) denotes a position-\nwise feed-forward network, and ATT(·) denotes\na multi-head attention. Residual connection (He\net al., 2016) and layer normalization (Ba et al.,\n2016) are used in each sub-layer, which are sup-\npressed in Equation 3 for clarity. Finally, the output\nrepresentation Y M of the decoder is projected into\nthe vocabulary space and the decoder outputs the\nhighest probability token.\nPGN PGN is a hybrid model of the typical\nSeq2Seq Attention model (Nallapati et al., 2016)\nand Pointer-Network (Vinyals et al., 2015). The\ninput dialogue is fed into the LSTM encoder token\nby token, producing the encoder hidden states. The\ndecoder receives word embedding of the previous\nword and generates a distribution to decide the tar-\nget token, retaining decoder hidden states. PGN not\nonly allows to generate from the ﬁxed vocabulary,\nbut also allows to copy from the input tokens.\nTraining Objective Model parameters θ are\ntrained to maximize the conditional likelihood of\nTrain Valid Test\nSAMSum\n# 14732 818 819\nAvg.Turns 11.13 10.72 11.24\nAvg.Tokens 120.26 117.46 122.71\nAvg.Sum 22.81 22.80 22.47\nAMI\n# 97 20 20\nAvg.Turns 310.23 345.70 324.40\nAvg.Tokens 4859.52 5056.25 5257.80\nAvg.Sum 323.74 321.25 328.20\nTable 1: Statistics for SAMSum and AMI datasets.\n“#” means the number of dialogue-summary pairs,\n“Avg.Turns”, “Avg.Tokens” and “Avg.Sum” mean the\naverage number of turns of dialogues, tokens of dia-\nlogues and tokens of summaries respectively.\nthe outputs in a parallel training corpus (D,S):\narg max\nθ\n∑\n(D,S)∈(D,S)\nlog p(S|D; θ). (4)\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Datasets\nWe experiment on 2 datasets (statistics in Table 1):\nSAMSum (Gliwa et al., 2019) is a human-\ngenerated dialogue summary dataset, which con-\ntains dialogues in various scenes of the real-life.\nAMI (Carletta et al., 2005) is a meeting summary\ndataset. Each meeting contains four participants\nand is about a remote control design project.\n4.2 Implementation Details\nDialoGPT We initialize DialoGPT withDialoGPT-\nlarge6. For SAMSum, we set keywords extraction\nratio rKE to 15, similarity threshold tRD to 0.99 and\ntopic segmentation ratio rTS to 15. For AMI, rKE\nis 4, tRD is 0.95 and rTS is 5 7.\nBART We initialize BART withbart.large8 . For\nﬁne-tuning on SAMSum, the learning rate is set to\n3e-05, the dropout rate is 0.1, the warmup is set to\n400. At the test process, beam size is 5, minimum\ndecoded length is 5 and maximum length is 100.\nPGN The word embedding size is set to 300 and\ninitialized with the pre-trained GloVe vector. The\ndimension of encoder and pointer decoder is set\nto 200. The dropout is set to 0.5. The learning\nrate is 0.001. At the test process, beam size is 10,\nminimum decoded length is 280 and maximum\nlength is 4509.\n6https://huggingface.co/transformers\n7We show more hyper-parameter search results for SAM-\nSum and AMI datasets in the supplementary ﬁle.\n8https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq\n9https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py\n1484\nModel R-1 R-2 R-L\nExtractive\nLONGEST-3 32.46 10.27 29.92\nTextRank 29.27 8.02 28.78\nAbstractive\nTransformer 36.62 11.18 33.06\nD-HGN 42.03 18.07 39.56\nTGDGA 43.11 19.15 40.49\nDialoGPT 39.77 16.58 38.42\nMV-BART 53.42 27.98 49.97††\nOurs\nBART 52.98 27.67 49.06\nBART(DKE) 53.43†† 28.03†† 49.93\nBART(DRD) 53.39 28.01 49.49\nBART(DTS) 53.34 27.85 49.64\nBART(DALL ) 53.70† 28.79† 50.81†\nTable 2: Test set results on the SAMSum dataset,\nwhere “R” is short for “ROUGE”.

DALL means the\nSAMSum with all three annotations. †and ††indicate\nthe ﬁrst-ranked and second-ranked results respectively.\n4.3 Baselines and Metrics\nFor SAMSum, LONGEST-3 views the ﬁrst three\nutterances as the summary. TextRank (Mihal-\ncea and Tarau, 2004) is a traditional graph-based\nmethod. Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a\nseq2seq method based on full self-attention oper-\nations. D-HGN (Feng et al., 2020a) incorporates\ncommonsense knowledge to help understand di-\nalogues. TGDGA (Zhao et al., 2020) uses topic\nwords and models graph structures for dialogues.\nDialoGPT (Zhang et al., 2020b) means that ﬁne-\ntuning DialoGPT on the SAMSum. MV-BART\n(Chen and Yang, 2020) is a BART-based method\nthat incorporates topic and stage information.\nFor AMI, SummaRunner (Nallapati et al.,\n2017) is an extractive method based on hierar-\nchical RNN network. UNS (Shang et al., 2018)\nis a fully unsupervised and graph-based method.\nTopicSeg (Li et al., 2019) incorporates topics to\nmodel the meeting. HMNet (Zhu et al., 2020) is a\ntransformer-based method that incorporates POS\nand entity information and is pre-trained on news\nsummarization dataset.\nWe adopt ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and BERTScore\n(Zhang et al., 2020a) for evaluating our models.\nModel R-1 R-2 R-L\nExtractive\nTextRank 35.19 6.13 15.70\nSummaRunner 30.98 5.54 13.91\nAbstractive\nUNS 37.86 7.84 13.72\nTopicSeg 51.53†† 12.23 25.47†\nHMNet 52.36† 18.63† 24.00\nOurs\nPGN 48.34 16.02 23.49\nPGN(DKE) 50.22 17.74 24.11\nPGN(DRD) 50.62 16.86 24.27\nPGN(DTS) 48.59 16.07 24.05\nPGN(DALL ) 50.91 17.75†† 24.59††\nTable 3: Test set results on the AMI dataset.\nPGN(DKE), PGN(DRD) and PGN(DTS) represent train-\ning PGN on the AMI with keywords, redundancy and\ntopic annotation respectively.\nSAMSum AMI\nModel BS Model BS\nBART 86.91 PGN 80.51\nMV-BART 88.46 HMNet 82.24\nBART(DALL ) 90.04 PGN(DALL ) 82.76\nTable 4: Test set results on the SAMSum and AMI.\n“BS” is short for BERTScore.\n4.4 Automatic Evaluation\nThe results on SAMSum and AMI are shown in Ta-\nble 2 and 3 respectively. We can see that using our\nannotated datasets DKE, DRD and DTS, both BART\nand PGN can obtain improvements. Furthermore,\nour BART(DALL ) achieves SOTA performance.\nFor SAMSum, it’s worth noting that BART(DKE)\nperforms better compared with BART( DRD) and\nBART(DTS). We attribute this to the fact that key-\nwords can retain essential information for shorter\ndialogues. For AMI, PGN( DRD) contributes the\nmost, which shows the importance of detecting re-\ndundancy in verbose meeting transcripts. Although\nHMNet and TopicSeg achieve better scores, HM-\nNet needs news summarization dataset to pre-train\nthe model and TopicSeg designs complex attention\nmechanism to incorporate topic information.\nIn terms of new embedding-based metric\nBERTScore (shown in Table 4), our method\nBART(DALL ) and PGN(DALL ) can consistently out-\nperform the baseline models10.\n10Evaluation details are shown in the supplementary ﬁle.\n1485\nModel Info.

For SAMSum, the inter-annotator agreement\n(Fleiss’ kappa) scores for each metric are 0.46, 0.37 and\n0.43 respectively. For AMI, Fleiss’ kappa scores are\n0.48, 0.40 and 0.41 respectively.\n4.5 Human Evaluation\nWe conduct a human evaluation of the dialogue\nsummary to assess its informativeness, conciseness\nand coverage. Informativeness measures how well\nthe summary includes key information. Concise-\nness measures how well the summary discards the\nredundant information. Coverage measures how\nwell the summary covers each part of the dialogue.\nWe randomly sample 100 dialogues (SAMSum)\nand 10 meetings (AMI) with corresponding gener-\nated summaries to conduct the evaluation. In order\nto reduce variance caused by humans, we have 4\nhuman evaluators and they were asked to rate each\nsummary on a scale of 1 to 5 (higher is better) for\neach metric. The results are shown in Table 5.\nWe can see that our method can achieve higher\nscores in all three metrics. Especially, combined\nwith DRD, our model can get the best score in con-\nciseness. Besides, combined with DTS, our model\ncan perform better in coverage. However, HMNet\ngets the best score in informativeness and coverage.\nWe argue this is because HMNet forces a minimum\nsummary length of 400. Due to this, it scores the\nworst in conciseness. For the AMI, we also ﬁnd\nthere is still a gap between the scores of generated\nsummaries and the scores of golden summaries,\nindicating that the AMI is more difﬁcult.\nMethod R-1 R-2 R-L\nRule-Based Methods\nEntities 53.36 27.71 49.69\nNouns and Verbs 52.75 27.48 48.82\nTraditional Methods\nTextRank 53.29 27.66 49.33\nTopic words 53.28 27.76 49.59\nPre-trained Language Model-Based Methods\nKeyBERT\nw/ BERT emb 52.39 27.14 48.52\nw/ DialoGPT emb 53.14 27.25 49.42\nOurs\nDialoGPTKE 53.43 28.03 49.93\nTable 6: Test set results of ﬁne-tuning BART on the\nSAMSum that is annotated with keywords using vari-\nous methods.

To verify the effective-\nness of our DialoGPTKE method, we ﬁne-tune\nBART on SAMSum, which is annotated by var-\nious keywords extraction methods. The results are\nshown in Table 6. We can see that our method\nachieves higher scores. The results also show that\nentities play an important role in the summary gen-\neration. Besides, combined with DialoGPT embed-\ndings, KeyBERT can get better results.\nTo give a quantitative evaluation, we view ref-\nerence summary words as golden keywords and\ncalculate the precision, recall and F1 scores for ex-\ntracted keywords. The results are shown in Table\n7. Directly using entities as keywords can get the\nbest precision score. However, both TextRank and\nEntities perform poorly in recall. Our method gets\nthe best score in terms of F1 and its advantage is\nmainly reﬂected in recall score, which shows our\nmethod can extract more diverse keywords.\n1486\nModel R-1 R-2 R-L\nSAMSum\nRule-based 53.00 27.71 49.68\nDialoGPTRD 53.39 28.01 49.49\nAMI\nRule-based 50.19 16.45 23.95\nDialoGPTRD 50.62 16.86 24.27\nTable 8: Test set results on the SAMSum and AMI\ndatasets that are annotated with redundant utterances.\n“Rule-based” indicates annotating utterances that con-\ntain no noun, verb and adjective as redundant.\nEffect of DialoGPT RD. To verify the effective-\nness of our DialoGPTRD method, we compare it\nwith a Rule-based method (Dinarelli et al., 2009),\nwhich annotates utterances without noun, verb and\nadjective as redundant. The results are shown in Ta-\nble 8. We can see that our method performs better.\nEspecially, our method shows more advantages for\nlong and verbose meeting transcripts in the AMI.\nEffect of DialoGPT TS. To verify the effective-\nness of our DialoGPTTS method, we compare it\nwith the C99 algorithm (Choi, 2000), which is\na sentence similarity-based segmentation method.\nChen and Yang (2020) enhance it with BERT (De-\nvlin et al., 2019) embeddings. We further combine\nthe algorithm with DialoGPT embeddings. The\nresults are shown in Table 9. We can see that\nour method can get comparable results with the\nstrong baseline C99(w/ DialoGPT emb). For AMI,\ncombined with golden topic annotation, PGN can\nachieve the best result, which shows modeling top-\nics is an essential task for dialogue summarization.\n4.7 Case Study\nFigure 4 shows summaries generated by different\nmodels for an example dialogue in the SAMSum\ndataset. We can see that BART (Lewis et al., 2020)\ntends to generate long and redundant summaries.\nBy incorporating topic and stage information, MV-\nBART (Chen and Yang, 2020) can generate sum-\nmaries that cover main topics of the dialogue. How-\never, it still suffers from redundancy problem. Our\nBART(DALL ) can get higher ROUGE scores while\ngenerating better summaries. The generated sum-\nmary can include extracted keywords and corre-\nspond to each topic of the dialogue. We also ﬁnd\nthat even some redundant utterances have already\nbeen detected, our model still generate the sum-\nmary contains some redundant information.

Beside, the AMI has golden topic\nsegmentation annotations.\nattribute this to the fact that the small dataset leads\nto insufﬁcient training of the model.\n5 Related Work\nDialogue Summarization Current works mainly\nincorporate auxiliary information to help better\nmodeling dialogues. Some works used various\ntypes of keywords to identify the core part of the\ndialogue, including entities (Zhu et al., 2020), do-\nmain terminologies (Koay et al., 2020) and topic\nwords (Zhao et al., 2020). Some works aimed to\nreduce redundancy, Zechner (2002); Murray et al.\n(2005) used sentence-level similarity-based meth-\nods. Some works incorporate topics as a coarse-\ngrained dialogue structure (Li et al., 2019; Liu et al.,\n2019; Chen and Yang, 2020). Other works also\nexplored dialogue act (Goo and Chen, 2018), dia-\nlogue discourse (Feng et al., 2020b) and common-\nsense knowledge (Feng et al., 2020a). In this paper,\nwe combine three types of auxiliary information\nto help better modeling dialogues, including key-\nwords, redundant utterances and topics.\nPre-trained Language Models Pre-trained mod-\nels such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT-3\n(Brown et al., 2020) have advanced various NLP\ntasks. On one hand, some works utilized the\nknowledge contained in pre-trained models by ﬁne-\ntuning on supervised data of downstream tasks\n(Qin et al., 2019; Liu and Lapata, 2019; Qin et al.,\n2020). On the other hand, some works examined\nthe knowledge in an unsupervised manner (Jiang\net al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020). Ku-\n1487\nRob : Hey there , what's up ?

Association for Computational Linguis-\ntics.\nA Evaluation Details\nFor ROUGE (Lin, 2004), we employ Py-rouge 11\npackage to evaluate our models following Gliwa\net al. (2019). For BERTScore (Zhang et al.,\n2020a), we use the ofﬁcial implementation 12\nto evaluate our models. The detailed com-\nmand line for BERTScore is bert-score -r\ngolden.txt -c gen.txt --lang en.\nB Ablation Studies for Annotations\nTo further verify the effectiveness of our method,\nwe conduct ablation studies for each annotation.\nThe results are shown in Table 10 and Table 11.\nWe can ﬁnd that: (1) For both datasets, train-\ning summarizers based on datasets with two of\nthree annotations can obtain improvements. (2)\nFor both datasets, training summarizers based on\n11https://pypi.org/project/py-rouge/\n12https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert score\nModel R-1 R-2 R-L\nOurs\nBART 52.98 27.67 49.06\nBART(DKE) 53.43 28.03 49.93\nBART(DRD) 53.39 28.01 49.49\nBART(DTS) 53.34 27.85 49.64\nBART(DKE+RD) 53.56 28.65 50.55\nBART(DKE+TS) 53.51 28.13 50.00\nBART(DRD+TS) 53.64 28.33 50.13\nBART(DALL ) 53.70 28.79 50.81\nTable 10: Test set results on the SAMSum dataset.\nBART means ﬁne-tuning BART on the original SAM-\nSum.

PGN(DKE+RD) represent\ntraining PGN on the AMI with both keywords and re-\ndundancy annotations.\ndatasets with two of three annotations can sur-\npass corresponding summarizers that are trained\nbased on datasets with one type of annotation (e.g.,\nBART(DKE+RD) is better than BART( DKE) and\nBART(DRD)). (3) Compared with summarizers\nthat are trained on DRD+TS and DKE+RD, summa-\nrizers that are trained on DKE+TS get relatively\nsmall improvements on both datasets. Neverthe-\nless, it indicates thatDialoGPTKE and DialoGPTTS\nstill have non-overlapping parts. (4) Combining all\nthree annotations, both summarizers can achieve\nthe best results in all ROUGE scores.\n1491\nC Hyper-parameter Search Results\nTables 12 to 17 show the hyper-parameter search\nresults. Finally, for SAMSum (Gliwa et al., 2019),\nwe set keywords extraction ratio rKE to 15, simi-\nlarity threshold tRD to 0.99 and topic segmentation\nratio rTS to 15. for AMI (Carletta et al., 2005), rKE\nis 4, tRD is 0.95 and rTS is 5.\nModel rKE R-1 R-2 R-L\nBART(DKE) 10 52.17 26.64 48.34\nBART(DKE) 15 53.43 28.03 49.93\nBART(DKE) 20 53.20 28.01 49.46\nBART(DKE) 25 52.78 27.35 48.67\nTable 12: Test set results on the SAMSum dataset.\nBART(DKE) means ﬁne-tuning BART on SAMSum\nwith keywords annotation. rKE means different key-\nwords extraction ratios.\nModel rKE R-1 R-2 R-L\nPGN(DKE) 3 49.76 16.03 23.64\nPGN(DKE) 4 50.22 17.74 24.11\nPGN(DKE) 5 49.63 16.71 23.88\nPGN(DKE) 6 49.70 16.92 24.42\nTable 13: Test set results on the AMI dataset.\nPGN(DKE) means training PGN on AMI with key-\nwords annotation. rKE means different keywords ex-\ntraction ratios.\nModel tRD R-1 R-2 R-L\nBART(DRD) 0.95 52.29 26.71 48.53\nBART(DRD) 0.96 53.20 27.98 49.68\nBART(DRD) 0.97 52.17 27.10 48.34\nBART(DRD) 0.98 53.29 27.89 49.71\nBART(DRD) 0.99 53.39 28.01 49.49\nTable 14: Test set results on the SAMSum dataset.\nBART(DRD) means ﬁne-tuning BART on SAMSum\nwith redundant utterances annotation. tRD means dif-\nferent similarity thresholds.\nModel tRD R-1 R-2 R-L\nPGN(DRD) 0.95 50.62 16.86 24.27\nPGN(DRD) 0.96 49.68 16.54 24.70\nPGN(DRD) 0.97 50.18 16.12 24.56\nPGN(DRD) 0.98 48.63 15.17 23.50\nPGN(DRD) 0.99 47.15 13.94 22.53\nTable 15: Test set results on the AMI dataset.\nPGN(DRD) means training PGN on AMI with redun-\ndant utterances annotation. tRD means different similar-\nity thresholds.\nModel rTS R-1 R-2 R-L\nBART(DTS) 10 53.21 27.38 49.32\nBART(DTS) 15 53.34 27.85 49.64\nBART(DTS) 20 52.82 27.34 49.05\nBART(DTS) 25 53.04 27.49 49.70\nTable 16: Test set results on the SAMSum dataset.\nBART(DTS) means ﬁne-tuning BART on SAMSum\nwith topic annotation. rTS means different topic seg-\nmentation ratios.\nModel rTS R-1 R-2 R-L\nPGN(DTS) 4 49.39 16.02 23.89\nPGN(DTS) 5 48.59 16.07 24.05\nPGN(DTS) 6 49.89 16.04 23.01\nPGN(DTS) 7 49.37 16.07 23.46\nTable 17: Test set results on the AMI dataset.\nPGN(DTS) means training PGN on AMI with topic an-\nnotation. rTS means different topic segmentation ratios."
