Turning . Tool wear\n1 Introduction\nThe automation of manual tasks is an important part of com-\npetitive and capable manufacturing processes. It is important\nto prevent productivity losses due to excessive tool changes or\nquality losses due to excessive tool wear or breakage [ 1]. In\nterms of tool wear, not only can such a tool failure be avoided\nbut also maximum use should be obtained from the tool. Re-\ncent developments in cutting tool materials and optimisation\nof machining process parameters have allowed longer tool\nlife, but the tools still wear out when used over extended\nperiods of time. Worn tools have a direct effect on the surface\nfinish and geometrical accuracy of the finished workpiece [ 2].\nUnplanned tool replacement can cause machine downtime\nand part non-conformance leading to economic loss [ 3]. To\navoid this, tool condition monitoring systems have been de-\nveloped which can warn the operator of the condition of the\ntool.\nTool wear monitoring systems have been developed over a\nlong period of time and numerous methods have been pro-\nposed such as those summarised by Siddhpura et al., Teti et al.,\nand Rehorn et al. [ 1, 3, 4]. An all-encompassing system has\nyet to be developed but success has been found with some\nresearch efforts. Methods can be categorised into direct (ra-\ndioactive, optical, electrical resistance, etc.) and indirect\nmethods (acoustic emission, spindle motor current, cutting\nforce, vibration, temperature, sound, etc.) [ 5].\nCurrently, the use of multi-sensory signals, such as acoustic\nemission, cutting force, vibration, current or power consump-\ntion of spindle motor, has been adopted and all sensory data is\nfused using artificial intelligence (AI) such as neural network\nand fuzzy logic to increase the reliability and robustness of the\n* T.

Several AI algorithms and signal processing tech-\nniques have been used to develop the tool wear monitoring\nsystem summarised by Teti et al. [ 4] and Worden et al.[ 6].\nAbellan-Nebot et al. [ 7] suggested the six key issues for the\ndevelopment of intelligent machining systems: sensor selec-\ntion, signal processing techniques, sensorial features normally\nused, feature extraction and selection, design of experiment\n(DoE) and characteristics of AI techniques. Several systems\nbased on AI approach have been successfully developed in the\npast as reported in this article. However, the majority of tool\nmonitoring research has applied expensive sensing systems\nnot suitable for production, such as force dynamometers. Even\nwith expensive data acquisition hardware, obtaining high-\nquality data to train the system is difficult and time-\nconsuming because of the complexity of the signals that can\nbe recorded from an operating machine. Ultimately, the reduc-\ntion of the cost, intrusive nature and number of sensors will\npromote industry application of these systems.\nIn this present work, audio signature in t process was\nreviewed to extract features which are sensitive to tool wear.\nMuch of the vibrations being excited in the cutting zone dur-\ning machining are in the range at which they can be heard by\nthe operator, and therefore be recorded by a standard audio\nmicrophone. Machine operators have been effective in the\ndetection of unacceptable cutting conditions, inferred through\nthe audible emissions from the cutting process. Microphones,\nbeing a non-contact sensor, are very easy and flexible to instal\nin the machine and there are a wide variety of inexpensive\nmodels with different performance characteristics. Micro-\nphones have been used extensively for chatter detection and\nhave also been used on occasion to monitor tool wear in turn-\ning processes [ 8– 10].\nIn previous studies, Teti et al. [ 4] reviewed several sound\nmeasurement techniques used to monitor flank wear during\nthe turning process. Several studies confirm that tool wear\nstate is correlated to the sound emitted during the machining\nfound in the following reviews.\nSound signature in the turning process was studied in order\nto find the relationship between sound signal and cutting\nspeeds and feed rates. Sound pressure in a time domain has\nbeen used by several studies to observe the change in ampli-\ntude according to tool wear [ 8, 9, 11, 12].\nTekiner used a microphone connected to a computer to\nrecord the cutting sounds in order to determine the best cutting\nparameters for cutting AISI 304 stainless steel according to\nprocess sound [11]. It was observed by Raja that the change of\ncutting parameters, cutting sound pressure levels also change\na n da ni n c r e a s ei nt o o lw e a rr e s u l t e di na ni n c r e a s eo fs o u n d\nsignal amplitude [ 8]. Similarly, Kopac et al. concluded that\nprogressive tool wear correlates with an increase in amplitude\nof the recorded sound between 6 and 20 kHz which is above\nthe frequency range within which machine background noise\nis normally found [ 9]. Audio techniques were also used by\nQuintana to determine the stability lobe diagram (SLD) in a\nmilling process by applying 3D sound mapping methodology.\nA microphone was mounted inside the milling machine, and\naudio signals from 600 cutting conditions were recorded and\nprocessed. The sound pressure level of each condition was\nplotted on a grid to identify the stable and unstable cutting\nconditions that are a key to avoiding chatter in the milling\nprocess [12].\nThe analysis of fast fourier transforms (FFT) of audible\nsound generated from the turning process was used by Lu\net al. to introduce the model for tool wear monitoring [ 13].\nThis model includes the main effects of tool wear on system\ndynamics during stable cutting of lathe machine. Alonso et al.\nproposed a sound-processing technique using singular spec-\ntrum analysis (SSA). This processing technique was used to\nextract the sound features from the cutting zone during the\nturning process. The results showed that the extracted features\nfrom sound and feed motor current signals correlate with tool\nwear state [ 14]. Raja used sound signal analysis, using the\nHilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), to monitor flank wear [ 8,\n15]. Cutting sounds from three states of tool wear (fresh,\nslightly worn, and severely worn) were recorded under several\ncutting conditions, and it is claimed that this signal processing\nmethod can be considered as simple and reliable for flank\nwear monitoring.\nAs flank wear has a direct effect on the surface finish of a\nmachined workpiece, measuring roughness of machined sur-\nfaces is normally performed to monitor the flank wear devel-\nopment. Surface roughness by machine vision techniques and\nso\nund processing techniques were attempted to develop the\ntool condition monitoring systems, which can be found in a\nnumber of studies. Manan et al. investigated the correlation\nbetween tool wear and machined surface and sound pattern\nfrom turning process. Sensorial features from a sound signal\nwere extracted for classifying tool wear states. The results\nfound that the propose system developed by machine vision\nand sound processing techniques can be utilised to effectively\nmonitor the condition of the cutting tool [ 10]. Similarly, flank\nwear, the surface roughness of machined sample, and machine\nTable 1 Typical composition (wt%) of EN24 steel\nC S i M n S P C rM o N iF e\n0.36/0.44 0.10/0.35 0.45/0.70 0.040 Max 0.035 Max 1.00/1.40 0.20/0.35 1.30/1.70 Bal.\n2782 Int J Adv Manuf Technol (2016) 86:2781 – 2790\ntool power consumption were used by Tekiner et al. as a\ncriteria to determine the best cutting condition for the machin-\ning of AISI 304 stainless steel [ 11]. Downey used a micro-\nphone, connected to a laptop via a sound card, in order to\nrecord the cutting sound in the turning machine. The cumula-\ntive magnitude of sound spectrum and surface roughness (Ra)\nwas compared for the full life of cutting tool. The variation of\nsound spectrum can be compared to the state of the cutting\ntool interface. It can also notice the change in audible sound\nspectra between normal tool and end of tool life [ 16].\nTo enhance reliability, multi-sensorial features from several\nsensors can be combined in order to develop a tool wear pre-\ndiction and classification model by using artificial intelligence;\nthis is known as sensor fusion. Alonso et al. used sound and\nfeed motor current to develop the monitoring system to detect\nthe tool wear. The features extracted from sound and feed mo-\ntor current signals by SSA correlate with tool wear state and\nwere trained by neural network to estimate the tool flank wear\n[14]. A radial basis function was used by Manan to train the\nnetwork which consists of features extracted from sound signal\nand surface roughness [10].This classification model is able to\nrecognise tool wear states which classify tool states (defined as\n‘sharp’, ‘semi-dull’ and ‘dull’), and the proposed system can be\nutilised to effectively monitor the condition of the cutting tool.\nTangjitsitcharoen et al. used a sensor fusion-based approach to\nmonitor tool wear using sound, force, vibration and AE signals\nand found that the energy spectrum density of sound and AE\nsignals are sensible to tool wear [ 17].\nNevertheless, the major limitation of using a microphone to\nrecord the cutting sound is the background noise from the\nenvironment. This can be from vibrations in the cutting zone,\nvibrations caused by the machine tool drive system, external\nsources and, in particular, noise from the flowing coolant.\nThis article describes an inexpensive method of obtaining\ntool condition information from an operating machine tool by\nrecording the sound emitted during machining and filtering\nthe unwanted noise to improve the effectiveness of an in-\nprocess tool wear monitoring system. The data obtained can\nalso be used as a basic tool condition monitoring system in its\nown right.\nIt should be noted that throughout this article, unless spe-\ncifically referred to as ‘signal noise ’ (as in ‘signal to noise\nratio’), all references to ‘noise’ should be taken to mean the\nsound (noise) that is emitted from the cutting zone or from the\nmachine itself.\n2 Experimental setup and procedure\n2.1 Equipment and cutting conditions\nA CNC lathe (MORI SEIKI NT4300DCG) was used to ma-\nchine EN24 steel (Table 1). The workpiece was a round bar\nwith a diameter of 200 mm and of a length always shorter than\nits diameter. It was cantilevered in the machine using a three-\njaw chuck with a face turning process performed across its\nfree end. All trials were conducted using CVD-coated carbide\ntooling inserts of a grade commonly used for the basic turning\no fE N 2 4a n dm e e t i n gI S OD N M G1 50 60 8 - P M( A N S I\nDNMG 442-PM). In production, an operator would typically\nuse the process parameters for cutting as suggested by the\ntooling manufacturer for the workpiece in question. In this\nwork, in order to accelerate tool wear and to consume less\nworkpiece material, process parameters were deliberately cho-\ns e nt ob ei ne x c e s so ft h o s et y p i c a l l yu s e df o rt h e s ei n s e r t s .\nSimilarly, in order to reduce the number of machining trials\nconducted, only two of the three main process variables, feed\nand cutting speed, were varied (Table 2), with depth of cut\nbeing constantly set at 0.5 mm. The cutting zone was flood\ncooled with Hocut795b throughout all the experimental trials.\nThe experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.AP C B\nPiezotronics 130E21 microphone (Fig. 1a) was used to\nrecord the cutting sound during the machining process.\nThese types of microphones are of a free-field condenser\nFig. 1 Arrangement of experimental apparatus showing the microphone\n(a) and its position in the machine tool ( b, c)\nTable 2 Process parameters used during machining trials\nCondition Cutting speed\n(Vc) (m/min)\nFeed rate ( F)\n(mm/rev)\nDepth of cut\n(D) (mm)\n1 300 0.30 0.5\n2 300 0.35 0.5\n3 300 0.40 0.5\n4 280 0.35 0.5\n5 280 0.40 0.5\n6 320 0.35 0.5\n7 320 0.40 0.5\nInt J Adv Manuf Technol (2016) 86:2781 – 2790 2783\ntype and have a frequency response of 20– 10,000 Hz with\na dynamic range >122 dB. They also are prepolarised and\nhave an integral preamplifer which reduces the complexity\nand cost of installation.\nPrior to the experimental trials, the machine was ob-\nserved conducting a typical flood-cooled turning operation\nto assess the optimum position for the microphone. It was\ndiscovered that a position 1.2 m away from the cutting\nzone was the best compromise between achieving a high\nquality recording, minimising potential damage from cool-\nant spray and providing a secure location to attach a\nmagnetic stand to the machine (Fig. 1b). The microphone\nwas also suitably enclosed to further minimise the chance\nof damage from the coolant. (Fig. 1c). The location of the\nmicrophone inside a machine also isolates it from any sig-\nnificant noise from nearby machines.\nThe microphone was connected to a National Instruments\nNI-9234 DAQ. The sound was sampled at 50 kS/s; analysis\nwas performed using National Instruments LabView and The\nMathworks Matlab software. All sound signals recorded from\nthe microphone were transformed into the frequency domain\nby FFT.\n2.2 Experimental methodology\nAll trials were conducted until the observable flank wear\nwidth (FWW) on the main cutting edge exceeded 0.4 mm.\nFor each condition, the inserts were removed from the tool\nholder and the flank wear width was measured optically (to\nISO-3685) every 10, 20 and 30 cuts. The frequency of\nmeasurement was then increased as the wear limit was\napproached. The tool wear measurements and the audio\nsignature for each test were then compared in order to\nestablish the relationship between tool wear and sound sig-\nnal. Figure 2 illustrates the observe d relationship between\nthe width of flank wear width and the number of cuts for\nthree typical data sets obtained in the experiment. In this\nparticular example, the three datasets represent the mea-\nsured flank wear width produced by three feed rates,\n0.30, 0.35 and 0.40 mm/rev, at constant cutting speed\n(a) 10th cut (b)20th cut \n(c) 30th cut (d)34th cut\nFig. 3 Flank wear development\nfrom cutting condition\nVc = 300 m/min and\nF = 0.35 mm/rev\nFig. 2 Typical tool wear evolution dataset for cutting conditions 1 – 3\nclassified into three wear states\n2784 Int J Adv Manuf Technol (2016) 86:2781 – 2790\n300 m/min (cutting conditions 1 – 3i nT a b l e 2). Each data\npoint represents a single measurement. It is seen that the\ntool wear state is classified into three regions; breaking-in\nperiod, steady-state wear region and failure region as\nshown by red dash lines. Figure 3 shows flank wear width\ndeveloped on the cutting insert, which was used in cutting\ncondition 2.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Observation of the sound from a cutting cycle\nThe multiple sources of sound in the cutting process in-\nclude those from the cutting mechanism itself, sound from\nthe machine tool spindle, drives and coolant delivery and\nsound from adjacent machines and workshop activities in a\nproduction environment. Previous studies have shown cor-\nrelation between sound emitted from the cutting mecha-\nnism and the flank wear of the cutting insert and that the\namplitude of sound signal increases with increasing tool\nflank wear when cutting low carbon and mild steels [ 8, 9,\n15]. It has also been reported that the machine and work-\nshop sound is an unwanted disturbance with respect to the\ntool monitoring task [ 9].\nIn this work, the audio recorded from each test was\nanalysed in the time-frequency domain by short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT) in order to establish the frequency content\nin the audio signature that could be then used for tool condi-\ntion monitoring. The analysis produced a spectrogram that\nrepresents the sound signal resulting from the machining pro-\ncess. The example spectrogram shown in Fig. 4 displays the\n(a) (b) \nFig. 5 Power spectrum of ( a)\nmachine background noise with\nno tool engagement ( b)d u r i n g\ncutting operation\nFig. 4 Spectrogram of audio recorded from cutting cycle\nInt J Adv Manuf Technol (2016) 86:2781 – 2790 2785\nmagnitude of frequency spectrum of the cutting sound record-\ned by the microphone during a 25-s cutting cycle at cutting\ncondition 1. The horizontal axis represents time, whilst verti-\ncal axis displays frequency. The amplitude of a particular fre-\nquency is represented by the colour intensity of each point.\nThe various events that occurred during the turning pro-\ncess are labelled. Each of these is clearly heard by the\nhuman ear when observing the machining process. It is\nseen that throughout the cycle, the sound signal was con-\ntaminated by machine background noise (A) which has a\nfrequency of 0– 3 kHz. The machine spindle is shown run-\nning by the higher amplitude horinzontal line between\npoints (B and D) with an example of spindle speed shifting\nat point (C). The increase in noise amplitude representing\nthe engagement of the cutting tool with the workpiece is\nshown at point (E). All trials were conducted in a wet\ncondition so a broadband frequency of coolant being ap-\nplied to the cutting zone is also depicted (F to G). To iso-\nlate the machine background noise, a recording of the ma-\nchine running with no cutting occurring was made and\nFig. 5a shows the test result in the frequency domain by\nthe power spectrum of the sound signal.\nClearly, the background noise frequency in Fig. 5a and b\nis in the range of 0 – 3 kHz, and several studies agree that\nbackground machine noise can be identified in the range of\n0– 2k H z[ 9]. It should be noted that although the machine\nused in these experiments has not been studied to fully\ncharacterise the stability of its noise output, the data pre-\nsented in Fig. 5 can be considered typical across all the\nexperiments conducted for this work. This means that this\npart of the signal can be easily filtered without any effect to\nthe signal of interest. It should be noted, that whilst chatter\ndetection systems should include this frequency content,\nthe tool condition monitoring objective in this case study,\nunder non-chatter conditions , may benefit from removing\nthis data.\nSimilarly, further observation of Fig. 4 identify the noise\nfrom spindle motor and can be seen as a long horizontal\nhigh-intensity line from point (B) to (D). This noise of\nspindle motor is found at 5.86 kHz as shown by power\nspectrum in Fig. 5b. This peak spindle-sound frequency\nmagnitude is defined as a promising feature of tool condi-\ntion monitoring.\nPoint (B) depicts the spindle start time as the motor is\nspeeding up to the desired rotational speed. Note the spindle\nis accelerating due to the facing operation requiring constant\nsurface speed. The maximum RPM of the spindle is reached in\nthe middle of cutting time (point C), where the spindle in-\ncreased its rotational speed automatically to keep surface\nspeed constant. Finally, the spindle was stopped (point D).\nFig. 8 Spindle noise for each individual cut at different cutting\nconditions\nFig. 7 Cumulative magnitude for a varying feed rate and constant cutting\nspeed\nFig. 6 Peak spindle-sound frequency magnitude vs the number of cuts\nfor a varying feed rate and constant cutting speed\n2786 Int J Adv Manuf Technol (2016) 86:2781 – 2790\nThe frequency band representing the coolant entering the cut-\nting zone can be seen from point F to G.\nOver the range of spindle noise frequency, it can be\nobserved that during cutting both intensity and frequency\nof cutting sound change from high to low represented by\nthe broad sweep of higher intensity from top left to bottom\nright of Fig. 4. Many of the previous studies in this area use\nthe sound signals present in the frequency range above\nmachine background noise to develop the tool wear mon-\nitoring system [ 6– 15]. However, as there is little reporting\nof using spindle noise in tool wear monitoring, this present\nwork concentrates on the spindle noise signal as a signal of\ninterest to extract a promising feature for tool condition\nmonitoring. The changes in frequency and magnitude of\nspindle noise were observed by FFT. This observation\nwas repeated for all of the machining trials performed\nand it was observed that the spindle noise was detected at\n5.86 kHz regardless of cutting conditions used on this par-\nticular machine.\nThis indicates that there is no significant correlation\nbetween the frequency of spindle noise and the develop-\nment of tool wear. In order to study the influence of cutting\nparameters on the magnitude of spindle noise frequency,\npower spectrum of spindle noise frequency were plotted in\ncombination of cutting speeds and feed rates which are\nnow discussed.\n3.2 The effect of feed rate on the spindle noise\nand detecting tool wear\nFor the trials where cutting speed was held constant and feed\nrate was varied (Fig. 6), it is seen that the onset of the rise in\nmagnitudes of the power spectrum of spindle noise occurs\nearlier as the feed rate is increased. This means that the amount\nof warning (time) the system can give the operator is depen-\ndent on the feed rate being used, i.e. the greater the feed, the\nearlier the warning.\na) Vc = 280, F = 0.35 b) Vc =  300, F = 0.35 c)   Vc = 320, F = 0.35\nd) Vc = 280, F = 0.4 e) Vc = 300, F = 0.4 f) Vc = 320, F = 0.4\nFig. 10 Magnitude of power spectrum of spindle noise and flank wear width (FWW) vs. varying cutting speed and feed rate\nFig. 9 Cumulative magnitude of spindle noise for each cut at different\ncutting conditions\nInt J Adv Manuf Technol (2016) 86:2781 – 2790 2787\nThe cumulative magnitude of spindle noise frequency\nwas plotted in Fig. 7 that each of curve was clearly\nseparated and has a warning signal at the turning point\nitself.\nIt is apparent that when the data set appears to grow expo-\nnentially, this is the point at which the tool should be replaced\nor warning occurs. In this case, for simplicity, a threshold\nvalue has been set as a tool change criteria. For example, using\na threshold do 0.008, the ending points of tool usage are about\ncut number 25, 30, 35 in feed 0.3, 0.35 and 0.4, respectively. It\nis seen that the magnitudes of spindle noise increase according\nto increasing of feed rate which suggests that the amount of\nwarning (time) the system can give the operator is dependent\non the feed rate being used, i.e. the greater the feed, the earlier\nthe warning.\n3.3 The effect of cutting speed on the spindle noise\nand detecting tool wear\nIn order to observe the effect of cutting speed on spindle noise,\nthe magnitude of the spindle noise frequency performed at\nconstant feed rate 0.35 mm/rev as shown in Fig. 8.I tc a nb e\nseen that the spindle noise frequency of a new tool has a low\nmagnitude in the power spectrum (cuts 1 – 20) and high mag-\nnitude for the worn tool. The magnitude of spindle noise fre-\nquency gradually decreases until the cutting insert becomes\ndull and broken.\nThe average magnitude of spindle noise increases with cut-\nting speed (V\nc). As is expected, the cuts performed at a higher\ncutting speed (Vc 320) have shorter tool life (cut 30) compared\nto the lower cutting speed (V c 280) (cut 40).

The\nabrupt change in the power spectrum magnitude of spindle\nnoise can be used as a warning signal for tool replacement.\nIt is worth noting that prior to the characteristic increase in\nmagnitude indicating the onset on tool failure, the relative\nmagnitudes of the signals from each of the different cutting\nspeeds vary with the number of cuts (Fig. 8). Similarly, when\nconsidering the cumulative magnitude, although the warning\nsignals are in the positions expected, the relative magnitude of\nthe signals prior to those points are not as expected (Fig. 9). It\nis suggested that the cutting conditions used in these experi-\nments are not different enough from each other to ensure any\nvariation in the results due to non-uniformity of workpiece\nmaterial and error in the experimental setup (e.g. changing\nworkpiece position in the machine as it is consumed) do not\noverlap.\n3.4 Detecting tool wear\nAlthough the frequency of the spindle noise remains constant,\nthis study found that the magnitude of spindle noise frequency\nalters in conjunction with the tool wear progression. The pow-\ner spectrum of all cuts was individually calculated and illus-\ntrates that the magnitude of the power spectrum of the spindle\nnoise frequency (multiple green lines) varies with tool wear\n(single blue line) as cutting takes place for the cutting condi-\ntions used in the machining trials (Fig. 10).\nIn general, and regardless of either considering the effect of\nvarying cutting speed or feed, the magnitudes of the power\nspectrum of spindle noise are low when the tools are in their\nbreak-in period and until half way through their steady-state\nwear region. As cutting progresses, the power spectrum mag-\nnitudes of spindle noise increase rapidly until reaching their\nmaximum value just prior to a sudden decrease just before tool\nfailure.\nThe cumulative of spectrum magnitudes comparing to\nflank wear during cutting are shown in Fig. 11.I ti so b s e r v e d\nthat the trends of the cumulative data slightly increase from\nthe start to half of the steady-wear period. Later, an abrupt\nchange is observed in the second half of the steady-state wear\nperiod. This can be used as a warning signal to indicate im-\nminent tool failure.\nBy considering the derivative of cumulative value, the con-\ndition of the tool can be monitored. It is normally low in the\nfirst and middle of the second periods of tool wear curve or\ntool flank wear less than 0.2 mm. The significant change of\nderivative value is warned at the middle of steady wear. In\nfailure region of tool wear curve, the derivative value intends\nto decrease to zero which is the point of tool failure.\nIt has been seen that an increase in the spectrum magnitude\nof spindle noise results from tool wear. As flank wear width\nincreases, the contact area between flank face and workpiece\nincreases which requires more cutting force and consequently,\nthe spindle motor requires more power to rotate the workpiece\nat the desired speed to overcome the increasing friction force\non the cutting contact area. The power consumption of spindle\nmotor was monitored and Fig. 12 shows the power used of\nspindle motor during cutting, which increase significantly.\nThis increasing power for workpiece rotation produces\nmore spindle noise. The increase in noise that this process\nproduces is clearly recorded by the microphone and can be\nused as an indicator of the onset of unwanted levels of tool\nwear; therefore, using spindle noise can be a candidate feature\nfor tool wear monitoring in a turning process.\nIt should also be noted that although a constant depth of cut\nwas used in this work (as discussed in Section 2.1)i ti se x -\npected that a similar relative change in the signal would be\nobserved if it was also varied because the power consumption\nof a cutting process is related to the material removal rate (i.e.\nthe product of depth of cut, cutting speed and feed). Similarly,\nit would be expected that repeating this work using different\nworkpiece materials would produce measureable differences,\nfor example using a workpiece of higher hardness (e.g.\nInconel) would lead to higher tool wear (and therefore more\nnoise) for a given cutting condition.\nA limitation of this work, however, is that monitoring tool\nwear using spindle power consumption is not adequate for low\ncutting force turning operations, and also has fluctuated pat-\ntern resulted from the temperature effect of spindle motor.\n4C o n c l u s i o n s\nThe conclusions of this work were as follows:\n1. It has been shown that the use of relative simple and\ninexpensive instrumentation can produce data that is of\nhigh enough quality to contribute to the condition moni-\ntoring of a running cutting process.\n2. The sound analysis process described can be used to eas-\nily characterise a particular machining process by record-\ning its audio signature and remove any unwanted environ-\nmental noise.\n3. There is no significant correlation between the frequency\nof spindle noise and tool wear, but it is possible to infer\nbasic knowledge about tool condition from the response\nof the magnitude of power spectrum of noise from the\nspindle to changing cutting speed and feed rate.\nInt J Adv Manuf Technol (2016) 86:2781 – 2790 2789\n4. The magnitude of spindle noise frequency spectrum and\nits cumulative value could be used as monitoring features\nin tool condition monitoring to assist with the selection of\nmore expensive instrumentation hardware or in combina-\ntion with similarly cost-effective sensors to provide a low\ncost tool wear monitoring system.\nAcknowledgments This research has been supported by the University\nof Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre with Boeing\n(AMRC) for experimental facilities.
