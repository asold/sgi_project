INTRODUCTION\nThe fundamentals of electronic transformers were born\nbetween 1968-1970, when William McMurray ﬁled his\npatent on high frequency magnetic links on AC-AC power\nelectronics converters. The magnetic link is related to a\nhigh/medium frequency transformer (HFT/MFT), which pro-\nvides insulation and step-up or step-down voltage levels [1].\nAdditionally, the electronic transformer brought about new\nfunctionalities when compared to the conventional bulky low\nfrequency transformer (LFT), such as: voltage regulation and\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Zhixiang Zou\n.\nprotections, e.g., voltage sag/swell compensation and current\ninterruption/saturation. The Solid-state transformer (SST)\ndesignator was introduced for the ﬁrst time in 1980 [2].\nHowever, on the contrary as presented in [1], a non-isolated\nconverter was proposed, i.e., in absence of a high frequency\nmagnetic link. It was intended to be used as replacement of\nthe US Navy’s LFTs that supplies energy to berthed ships.\nThe conventional LFTs were bulky and heavy, in addition\nto ﬁre risk due to the old fashioned Ascarel insulating oil\nsystems [2].\nThe ﬁrst technical report of an SST dates back 50 years, but\nonly in the past few decades has it been getting real attention\n[3], as consequences of: the wide band gap semiconductors\n141182 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\ntechnologies improvements, the smart grid concept rise, the\nrenewable energy growth and the new application areas of the\nSST. There are many different designators in the literature\nthat refer to SSTs according to each area of application,\nsuch as: Universal Power Electronics [4]; IUT - Intelligent\nUniversal Transformer [5]; ECC - Energy Control Center\n[6]; Energy Router [7]; PETT - Power Electronics Traction\nTransformer [8]; ST - Smart Transformer [9], [10].\nIt can be seen that there are many acronyms for SSTs and,\nin fact, for new readers, it may cause confusion. According\nto [1] and [11], the basic idea of the SST is the voltage\nlevel transformation by means of an HFT/MFT transformer,\nin such way that it could lead to volume and weight savings\nwhen compared to the power grid LFTs. However, other\nauthors [12] classify the SST as a three-port converter with\na high frequency magnetic link, where, regarding voltage,\nthe following characteristics of each port must be observed:\nmedium voltage AC, low voltage AC and low voltage DC.\nIn this way, the SST is able to interface with the power grid\nwith AC loads, energy storage and renewable energy systems.\nOther authors [13] claim that an SST is compounded by\npower electronics static converters that allow isolation among\nmedium voltage and low voltage systems through medium\nfrequency transformers. Regardless Brooks [2] named his\nnon-isolated converter an SST. It can be noted that all the\nauthors state that the galvanic isolation is a fundamental\ncharacteristic of the SST. Thus, the key concepts of an SST\nare summarized:\n• Capacity to work with distribution grid voltage levels;\n• Galvanic isolation through high/medium frequency\ntransformers;\n• Controllability.\nThe SSTs can have multiple stages of energy conversion\nand they can be classiﬁed in regard to the characteristic of\nthe DC link. Different types of AC-AC SSTs are illustrated\nin Fig. 1, as presented in [11], [14].\nFIGURE 1. Solid state transformer architectures classification regarding\nposition of the DC link or in absence of DC link [11].\nIt is well known that the commercial Silicon Carbide (SiC)\nMetal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOS-\nFET) devices are still limited to 1.7 kV , as well as in the case\nof the Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) that remains\nlimited to 6.5 kV . Thus, in the medium voltage (MV) environ-\nment the series connection of semiconductors or converters is\nmandatory to reduce the voltage stresses on devices. The MV\nstages of the four types of SSTs in Fig. 1 can be implemented\nas input-series output-parallel (ISOP) of nm modules.\nThe direct type AC-AC SST was classiﬁed as type I and it\nuses matrix and/or cycle-converters, which result in a solution\nwithout a DC link. The lack of energy storage devices, such\nas a DC link, deteriorate the converter controllability. As a\nresult, the output frequency is equal to the input frequency,\nthere is no reactive compensation and neither output voltage\nbalancing due to single-phase fault of the MV grid. On the\nother hand, in general, due to the reduced energy conversion\nstages, the SST based on type I architecture results in higher\nefﬁciency with minimized weight and volume [3], [15].\nThe SSTs based on type I architecture which have a\nfront-end low frequency (LF) rectiﬁer, without a DC link,\ncan be used to generate a unipolar |AC| voltage pulsating\nat twice the grid frequency. As a result, the medium fre-\nquency (MF) stage can be implemented with an |AC|-AC or\nwith an |AC|-|AC| converter, wherein, e.g., the two-quadrant\nswitches (TQSs) can be employed to reduce the total switch\ncount on the MV side. In regard to the SSTs based on\n|AC|-|AC| converters, another back-end |AC|-AC LF inverter\nis needed to unfold the output voltage of the MF stage. Then,\nthe SST’s output LV AC port is generated. The |AC| symbol\ncan be read as ‘‘rectiﬁed AC’’ in reference to unipolar voltage\nthat has a sinusoidal component. This nomenclature was\nalso used in [3], [16]–[18], and it highlights a differentiation\nfrom the AC-DC converters, because on rectiﬁers the low\nfrequency components (100 Hz or 120 Hz) must be absorbed\nby a bulky low frequency ﬁlter.\nThe type II architecture has a low voltage DC link (LVDC)\nand two energy conversion stages, whose ﬁrst AC-DC stage is\nan isolated front-end rectiﬁer and the second stage, a DC-AC\nconverter. According to [14], this kind of solution has the\nfollowing disadvantages: the 120 Hz voltage ripple on the\nDC link; the volume occupied by the DC link in regard to\nthe total volume of the converter; and lower efﬁciency. The\ntype III architecture is similar to type II, both have two stages,\nbut the DC link is located on the medium voltage side and the\nisolation is implemented in the back-end DC-AC converter.\nBoth type II and III have a higher degree of controllability\nthan type I, as the type II also enables an interface with\nrenewable energy by means of the LVDC link.\nLastly, the type IV has three energy conversion stages and\ntwo DC links (MVDC and LVDC), which bring a higher\ndegree of freedom to the control, modulation and hardware\ndesign, since there are a world of topologies that can be used\nin each stage. However, when compared to the other types it\nhas higher complexity and cost, due to the large amount of\ncomponents and cascaded converters.\nRecently, articles from big companies researching SST in\ntraction environments have been published (Siemens [19],\nBombardier [20], Alstom [21] and ABB [22]). The controlla-\nbility and volume and weight savings are attractive attributes\nof the SSTs for traction systems [13]. The SSTs in MV grid\napplications remain as academic research (PES-ETHz [13],\nVOLUME 8, 2020 141183\nR. L. DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\n[23], FREEDM [24]–[26] and CAU-Kiel [9], [27]), but indus-\ntry applications can be found, such as in [28], [29] from Gen-\neral Electric (GE), and a mixed consortium among industry\nand university (UNIFLEX [30], [31]). There is a consensus\namong many authors that the SSTs on power grid applications\nare still a major challenge [10], [11], [13], [23], [32].\nThe Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and\nManagement (FREEDM) project, e.g., was created by the\nNational Science Foundation (NSC) to establish research\nand development of new technologies for the improvement\nof electrical grid systems. The SST is one area of interest,\nin which results of three generations of SSTs can be seen\nin [15], [26], [33]. In these projects, the new 15 kV rated\nSiC devices, as well as the 6.5 kV IGBTs, were employed\nto minimize the number of modules on ISOP arrangements,\nor even to convert energy from the MV side to the LV side of\nthe power grid with only one converter.\nThe Power Electronic System Laboratory-ETHz has many\npublished works on SSTs in all different application areas.\nIn a distribution grid, the project called MEGAlink [23] devel-\noped a type IV three-phase SST with 1 MV A rated power to\ninterface with an MV grid of 10 kV with an LV grid of 400 V ,\nwherein each phase is compounded by ﬁve isolated AC-DC\nmodules on ISOP arrangements and by two back-end three-\nphase DC-AC converters working in parallel. The number\nof modules was deﬁned from an optimization routine [34]\nand interesting reliability aspects regarding redundancy were\nshown. The modules have two stages, wherein the ﬁrst one\nis an AC-DC neutral-point clamped (NPC) converter using\n1.7 kV IGBTs and the second one is an isolated DC-DC LLC\nseries resonant converter (SRC) [35], [36]. More details and\ncomparisons with LFTs can be seen in [13], [23]. Another\nproject focused on smart grids is the MEGACube, in which a\nDC-DC SST is proposed. Lastly, the Swiss SST (S 3T ) project\nsupported by the Swiss government has the goal of modern-\nizing the electrical grid, i.e., smart grid concept applications.\nIn this project, there are many publications on SST, based\non 10 kV SiC devices [16], [17], [37]–[39].\nThe University of Kiel started a project called HEART\n(Highly Efﬁcient And Reliable Smart Transformer) in 2014.\nThey proposed a smart transformer concept along with the\nmodular architecture of static converters based on type IV\nSSTs. A communication scheme between the loads and the\npower distribution company was also subject of discussion\n[9], [27]. The quadruple-active bridge (QAB) converter was\nemployed on the DC-DC stage of the SST using the 1.2 kV\nIGBTs for the integration of an MV grid of 10 kV with an LV\ngrid of 400 V at 1 MV A rated power [40].\nThe Universal and Flexible Power Management\n(UNIFLEX-PM) project was born out of a consortium among\ncompanies and universities in Europe. An SST was proposed\nto interface with two MV AC grids of 3.3 kV with an\nadditional DC port for energy storage systems integration.\nThe experimental efﬁciency of the SST was 93% [31], [41].\nThe Solid State Power Substation (SSPS), with a rated\npower of 1 MV A, was a project developed by GE for energy\nconversion from a single-phase MV AC grid of 13.8 kV to\nan LV AC grid of 265 V by means of an SST [28], [29].\nThe proposed structure is a type I SST and it is composed\nof four modules on ISOP arrangements, wherein the new SiC\ndevices of 10 kV / 120 A were employed. According to [28],\nthe implemented SSPS prototype achieved an efﬁciency of\n97% with output power of 855 kV A. The ﬁnal weight of the\nprototype was a quarter of a conventional LFT, as the volume\nwas also halved.\nFIGURE 2. The proposed three-phase SST showing the block diagram of\neach independent phase. One phase is compounded by 12 modules\n(Folding bridge+HSCSRC) with single back-end unfolding bridge and line\nconditioner. The processed power of each module is 1.67 kW, which\nresults in 20 kW per phase. The unfolding bridge is rated at 20 kW, while\nthe line conditioner works with a small percentage of the total power.\nIn this work, a type I three-phase SST with a rated power\nof 60 kV A, illustrated as a block diagram in Fig. 2, is being\nproposed for a Brazilian distribution grid of 13.8 kV/380\nV (line-to-line voltages). The full scale prototype is under\ndevelopment, and for that reason, experimental results will\nbe shown for the reduced scale prototype highlighted in\nFig. 2. It can be seen that twelve AC-|AC| modules were\narranged on the ISOP conﬁguration to deal with the medium\nvoltage of the power grid. Each module of the SST was\nimplemented in two stages: the ﬁrst one is a front-end\nAC-|AC| folding-bridge working at the grid frequency; and\nthe second one is a medium frequency |AC|-|AC| Hybrid\nSwitched Capacitor Series Resonant Converter (HSCSRC)\n[42], [43] shown in Fig. 3. Finally, a back-end |AC|-AC\nunfolding-bridge is implemented to generate the LV AC out-\nput port of the SST. In addition, a line conditioner can also be\nimplemented on the output port to regulate the output voltage\nof the SST, enabling voltage sag/swell compensation.\nThe FB topology with rectangular three-level PWM mod-\nulation can be used to implement the voltage regulator, which\ngenerates a positive or negative sinusoidal voltage 1vo to\ncompensate an increase or decrease of the load’s voltage\n(va, vb or vc). The power processed by the conditioner is\njust a small percentage of the total power, and it can be\npreviously deﬁned in the design stage. More details of the\nprinciple of operation of this line conditioner can be seen in\n141184 VOLUME 8, 2020\nR. L. DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\nFIGURE 3. The simplest configuration of the proposed SST, in which it is composed of a single-phase with\nonly one module (Folding bridge+HSCSRC) cascaded with the unfolding-bridge.\n[44]. Another solution to control the output voltage could be\nan |AC|-|AC| buck-boost stage before the unfolding bridge,\nbut it could be detrimental regarding efﬁciency. These kind\nof series and parallel voltage compensation by means of an\nauxiliary converter is being studied, and is a subject for an\nanother article.\nThe proposed SST on the single-phase conﬁguration and\nwith only one module, as well as without the line conditioner,\nis illustrated in Fig. 3. In the MV stage of the HSCSRC\nconverter, the SiC devices of 1.2 kV available on the market\nwere employed. The switches on the MV side of the HSCSRC\nconverter (S1,..,6 in Fig. 3) are subjected to half of the input\nvoltage of the module, due to the switched-capacitor (SC)\nladder cell. This allows a reduction in the total module count\non the ISOP arrangement when compared to the other SSTs\nbased on ISOP arrangements with the full-bridge (FB) and\nhalf-bridge (HB) SRC converters, in which the voltage across\nthe switches on the MV side is equal to the total input voltage\nof the module (v iMx ).\nUnder nominal operation, e.g., the peak voltage across the\nswitches S1,..,6 of the HSCSRC converter is equal to 813 V\n(\n√\n2\n2 1150 V), which results in 68% of the SiC MOSFET max-\nimum voltage of 1.2 kV . For instance, it would be necessary\nfor at least twenty four modules on the ISOP arrangements to\nmaintain the same percentage of 68% between peak and max-\nimum voltage on the switches of the SSTs based on FB [45]\nand HB [17] topologies. As another example, the FB-LLC\nconverter (with SiC switches of 1.2 kV) was employed on the\nMV side of an SST [45], and ﬁfteen modules were necessary\nto work with an input voltage of 7.2 kV . In the proposed\nSST with the HSCSRC converter, just twelve modules are\nnecessary to work with an input voltage of 13.8 kV with the\nsame SiC switches of 1.2 kV .\nThe following advantages of an HSCSRC-based SST\ncan be highlighted: minimized switching losses on\nHard-switching or Soft-switching (e.g., in situations of partial\nzero voltage switching (ZVS)) due to the reduced voltage\nstress on the switches; natural balance between the divider\ncapacitors of the SC ladder cell due to the SC principle of\noperation; reduction of the conduction losses (lower voltage\nrated semiconductors are required, which means lower drain\nto source resistances); minimized voltage derivatives (dv/dt )\nleading to the reduced electromagnetic interference (EMI)\nproblems; and lower differential mode insulation stresses in\nthe MFTs due to lower primary voltage (v Mx /2).\nAnother characteristic of the SST based on the HSCSRC\nconverter is the ﬂexibility in regard to the switch technology\nthat can be used in the power stage, instead of the usual\nMOSFET-based SC topologies. This is possible because the\nSC charge/discharge time constant (τ =RscCsc) is adjusted\nby means of the resistor Rsc which is purposely added in series\nwith the Csc capacitor (see Fig. 3), rather than the drain to\nsource resistance of the MOSFETs switches on typical SC\nconverters. As a consequence, e.g., the commercial 6.5 kV\nIGBTs can be used to implement the switches S1,..,6, in the\nway that a single module solution could be employed on the\ndistribution systems of 7.2 kV and 4.16 kV .\nThe main purpose of this article is to present the funda-\nmentals of the proposed SST in Fig. 2, and in Fig. 3, using\nthe |AC|-|AC| HSCSRC converter as the principal block of\nenergy conversion from the MV side to the LV side. The\ntheoretical analysis is shown in sections II and III, in which\nthe topological stages, the static and switching analysis, the\ncurrent stresses of the SC ladder cell and the main design\nparameters are discussed. In section IV , the design methodol-\nogy of the HSCSRC converter, as well as the selection criteria\nin the number of modules, are presented. Finally, in section V ,\nexperimental results will be shown with the single-phase and\nsingle-module reduced scale prototype highlighted in Fig. 2,\nwith a rated power of 1.67 kW with an input voltage of\n1.15 kV and output voltage of 220 V .\nII. THE LOW FREQUENCY STAGES’ OPERATION MODE\nAs already discussed, the proposed SST is composed of\ntwo low frequency stages: the front-end AC-|AC| folding\nbridge; and the back-end |AC|-AC unfolding bridge. The\nisolation and voltage level transformation is implemented\nwith the medium frequency |AC|-|AC| HSCSRC converter.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 141185\nR. L. DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\nThe switches’ gate signals of the folding and unfolding\nbridges are synchronized with the MV grid. The topological\nstages at the grid frequency (f g) are illustrated in Fig. 4(a)-(b).\nThe gate signals shown in Fig. 4(c) are generated with a sim-\nple zero-crossing detector of the MV grid voltage. A draw-\nback of this solution is the measurement of the MV grid\n(twelve times the module’s input voltage shown in Fig. 4(d)),\nconsidering the required insulation level of the 15 kV class.\nFIGURE 4. Topological stages of the front-end folding bridge and\nback-end unfolding bridge at the grid frequency. The medium frequency\nHSCSRC stage can be considered as simple as a gain.

(g) Rectified load current. (h) Rectified output voltage\nof the HSCSRC stage (vo,SRC ). (i) Output AC voltage (vo).\nWhen looking at the topological stages at the grid fre-\nquency, the MF HSCSRC converter can be seen as a voltage\ngain block, since it works with a switching frequency (f s)\nideally equal to the resonance frequency (f o) of the series\nelements Lr and Cr in Fig. 3. Consequently, there is no\nadditional impedance seen by the LF converters, only the\nvoltage level between the MV and LV sides are modiﬁed\nthrough the MFT of the HSCSRC converter. As can be seen\nin Fig. 4(e) and in Fig. 4(h), the rectiﬁed AC input voltage\nof the HSCSRC converter (|v iM |) is in phase-disposition with\nthe stepped-down rectiﬁed output voltage (v oSRC ). As a conse-\nquence, the output AC vo voltage in Fig. 4(i) remains in phase\nwith the input voltage of the module (v iM ).\nThe folding/unfolding bridges were also employed in [15]\nand [45]. These LF converters allow the use of the TQSs on\nthe HSCSRC converter, reducing the switch count working\nat medium frequency. As a consequence, the efﬁciency is\nincreased, since the total switching and conduction losses are\nminimized. The major beneﬁt of the front-end and back-end\nLF converters are: robustness; simplicity; the ZVS switching\nof the Sf 1,..,4 and Su1,..,4 switches; and the high efﬁciency\n(efﬁciencies higher than 99% are easily achievable).\nIII. ANALYSIS OF THE |AC|-|AC| HSCSRC CONVERTER\nThe |AC|-|AC| HSCSRC converter shown in Fig. 3 was\noriginated from the integration between the SC ladder cell\nwith the FB-LLC series resonant converter (LLC-SRC) with\nsynchronous rectiﬁcation. The switches S1,..,6 of the hybrid\nSC ladder cell (MV side), as well as the switches So1,..,4\nof the synchronous rectiﬁer (LV side), are controlled using\nthe pulse width modulation (PWM) with constant duty cycle\n(50%) and invariable switching frequency (f s). The input and\noutput rectiﬁed AC voltages (|AC|) of this MF stage are\nshown in Fig. 4(e) and (h), in which the 120 Hz frequency\ncomponent can be seen. The input voltage of the module\nis halved by means of the divider capacitors Cd1 and Cd2.\nThe voltage balance is guaranteed through the SC capacitor\n(Csc in Fig. 3) and, then, the voltage across the switches\nS1,..,6 are equal to half of the module’s input voltage without\nany additional control. The switching frequency fs is almost\nmatched with the resonance frequency fo (fo = 1\n2π√Lr Cr\n) of\nthe series elements (actually the fs frequency is selected a\nlittle bit lower than fo). Thus, ideally, all the switches have\nzero current switching (ZCS), ZVS switching can also be\nachieved through a proper design of the MFT’s magnetizing\ninductance (Lm). The soft-switching on all MF switches is the\nmain attribute of the HSCSRC converter. Another well known\nfeature of SRC-based converters is that the output voltage is\nalmost load-independent when operating near the resonance\nfrequency.\nA. HIGH FREQUENCY TOPOLOGICAL STAGES\nDuring a switching period (T s), the input voltage of the HSC-\nSRC converter can be assumed constant (V iM ,Ts), because the\nswitching frequency fs is much higher than the grid frequency\nfg. Thus, high frequency topological stages can be analyzed\nfrom the equivalent circuits shown in Fig. 5(a)-(b).\nIn the ﬁrst stage, the odd switches are turned on (Fig. 5(c)).\nThen, a positive vab voltage (V iM ,Ts/2 due to the SC ladder\ncell) is applied to the input port of the resonant tank formed\nby the series elements Lr and Cr (see Fig. 5(a) and (d)). The\niLr current through the series elements is the same primary\ncurrent of the MFT (i.e., Lr is all primary referred MFT’s\nleakage inductance), and it is composed of the magnetizing\ncurrent (i Lm ) and the fundamental sinusoidal current on the\nresonance frequency (f o) of the series elements, as illustrated\nin Fig. 5(d). The second topological stage begins when the\nodd switches S1,3,5 and So1,3 are turned off and, then, the even\nswitches S2,4,6 and So2,4 are turned on. The equivalent circuit\nis presented in Fig.5(b). In this stage, a negative vab voltage\n(vab =−V iM ,Ts/2) is applied to the input port of the resonant\ntank, then the iLr current is negative and the magnetizing\ncurrent has a negative slope as well.\nThe voltages across the series elements Lr and Cr are\nshown in Fig. 5(e). It can be seen that they are in quadrature\nwith the iLr current, the exact behavior of a pure AC sinu-\nsoidal circuit, in which the vLr voltage leads the current by\n90◦, while the vCr voltage lags the current by 90 ◦. Thus, the\n141186 VOLUME 8, 2020\nR. L. DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\nFIGURE 5.

(h) Current through the capacitorsCd1, Cd2 and Csc .\nresulting total voltage across the series elements is zero at\nany time (v Lr +vCr =0, see Fig. 5(e)), because the voltages\nvLr and vCr are shifted by 180 ◦. It means that the impedance\nis null on the iLr current path, and it only happens when the\nswitching frequency equals the resonance frequency of the\nseries elements. As a consequence, the vab and vcd voltages\nstay in phase.\nB. STATIC GAIN\nAs a conclusion from the previous topic, the total voltage drop\nis zero across the Lr and Cr elements (Fig. 5(e)). Thus, from\nFig. 5(a)-(b) it can be seen that the vab voltage is directly\napplied to the output port. Thus, the value of the output\nvoltage voSRC is proportional to the vab voltage by means of\nthe transformer gain (n), as shown in (1). Ideally, the gain\nof a transformer is the turns ratio (n t ) itself deﬁned as the\nquotient between the secondary (N s) and primary (N p) turns\n(n = nt = Ns/Np). However, on the following topics,\nit will be shown that the leakage and magnetizing inductances\nof the transformer should be considered on the MFT’s gain\ncalculation, specially in cases with large leakage inductance\nvalues. The HSCSRC converter’s static gain (G v,HSCSRC ) is\ndetermined by\nGv,HSCSRC =VoSRC\n|Vab|=n, (1)\nwhere |Vab|is equal to ViM ,Ts/2, which results in (2).\nGv,HSCSRC =VoSRC\nViM ,Ts\n=n\n2 (2)\nThe gain of the single-phase SST in regard to a stack of\nnm modules on the ISOP arrangement and of the MV grid\nvoltage (vg) is determined in (3).

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF THE HSCSRC RESONANT\nCONVERTER\nThe peak value of the iLr current at the grid period (I Lr,pk_Tg)\ncan be determined in function of design parameters, as well\nas the equations of the series elements Lr and Cr . All\nthe current stresses on the HSCSRC converter can also\nbe related to ILr,pk_Tg, such as the current through the\nSC capacitor (i Csc ). The calculation and variables which\nrefer to the switching period have the index symbol Ts,\nwhile the ones related to the grid period have the index\nsymbol Tg.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 141187\nR. L. DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\nFIGURE 6. Discontinuous sinusoidal component of theiLr current due to\nthe outputCo capacitor influence. The magnetizing current is neglected to\nreinforce the discontinuous sinusoidal component.\n1) THE RESONANCE FREQUENCY AND PEAK VALUE OF THE\niLr CURRENT\nThe iLr current through the series elements shown in Fig. 5(d)\nis composed of the magnetizing current iLm and the sinusoidal\ncomponent of the resonant tank related to the output power.\nThe low capacitance values of the output Co capacitor (µF\nrange) have inﬂuence on the resonance frequency fo, because\nwhen it is referred to the MV side through n2 (where n ≤\n1) it has a similar value of the resonant Cr capacitor (nF\nrange). The SC ladder cell’s capacitors have values on the\nµF range, and they can be neglected regarding resonance.\nThus, the inﬂuence of the output capacitor can be considered\non the resonance calculation (4) by means of an equivalent\ncapacitance (Ceq), determined by the series connection of the\nCr and n2Co capacitors in (5), because the high frequency\ncomponent of the iLr current also passes through the Co\ncapacitor. As a result, the equivalent resonance frequency\n(fo,eq) is higher than fo, because the equivalent capacitance\nCeq is lower than Cr , resulting in the discontinuous iLr current\nwaveform as illustrated in Fig. 6.\nfo,eq = 1\n2π√Lr Ceq\n(4)\nCeq = Cr n2Co\nCr +n2Co\n(5)\nThe zero interval (T z) of the iLr current shown in Fig. 6 is\nnot a problem, in view of the guarantee of ZCS switching.\nA precise method of determination of Tz and of the iLr\ncurrent half cycle duration was shown in [46]. For the sake\nof simplicity, in this work the half cycle duration is estimated\nthrough the calculation of To,eq (To,eq =1/fo,eq) which leads\nto good results, as will be shown.\nAs a consequence of the rectiﬁed AC input voltage of\nthe HSCSRC converter, all the voltage and current wave-\nforms of this MF stage also have the low frequency envelope\nof 120 Hz, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Thus, the peak value of the\niLr current changing at each switching period is ILr,pk_Ts. This\nvariation can be related to the angular frequency of the grid\n(ωg), as presented in (6), wherein ILr,pk_Tg is the peak value of\nthe iLr current at the grid period Tg presented in Fig. 6, and it is\na design parameter. It can be related to the output power (P o)\nand output voltage (peak value of Vo,pk_Tg) of one module,\nby calculating the average value of the rectiﬁed output current\n(io) of the HSCSRC converter (shown at high frequency in\nFig. 5(f)). The io current is the sinusoidal component of the\niLr current itself, but rectiﬁed and referred to the LV side (as\nillustrated in Fig. 4(f)). Thus, the average calculation can be\nﬁrst performed at the switching period Ts (7), resulting in (8).\nILr,pk_Ts\n(\nωgt\n)\n=ILr,pk_Tg sin\n(\nωgt\n)\n(6)\nIo,avg_Ts\n(\nωgt\n)\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nTs\n·\nTo,eq\n2∫\n0\nILr,pk_Ts\n(\nωgt\n)\nn sin\n(\nωo,eqt\n)\ndt\n(7)\nIo,avg_Ts\n(\nωgt\n)\n= 2\nπ\nfs\nfo,eq\nILr,pk_Ts\n(\nωgt\n)\nn (8)\nApplying (6) into (8) and integrating at the grid period Tg\n(9), is how the average value of the output io current (Io,avg_Tg)\nof the module is determined (10).\nIo,avg_Tg = 1\nπ\nπ∫\n0\n(\n2\nπ\nfs\nfo,eq\nILr,pk_Tg sin\n(\nωgt\n)\nn\n)\ndωgt (9)\nIo,avg_Tg = 4\nπ2\nfs\nfo,eq\nILr,pk_Tg\nn (10)\nThe average value of the load’s rectiﬁed |iRo|current\nshown in Fig. 4(g), which is determined in (11), must be\nequal to the average value Io,avg_Tg of the module’s output\ncurrent (10). Then, equating (10) and (11), the peak value\nILr,pk_Tg of the iLr current is found (12). It can be seen that\nthe peak value is related to the ratio between the equivalent\nresonance frequency fo,eq and the switching frequency fs, due\nto the inﬂuence of the output Co capacitor. When the Co\ncapacitor is much higher than the Cr capacitor, the frequency\nratio fo,eq/fs is unitary (C eq ∼=Cr ) and, then, the ideal case of\nfo,eq =fo =fs can be achieved.\nIRo,avg_Tg = 2\nπIRo,pk_Tg =4\nπ\nPo\nVo,pk_Tg\n(11)\nILr,pk_Tg =fo,eq\nfs\nn πPo\nVo,pk_Tg\n(12)\n2) DESIGN EQUATIONS OF THE SERIES ELEMENTSLr AND\nCr\nThe voltage across the Cr capacitor (v Cr ) also has the low\nfrequency envelope, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

Thus, when\nthe iLr current is maximum (I Lr,pk_Tg), the vCr voltage is\nalso maximum (V Cr,pk_Tg). In this way, the interpretation\nof the second integral in (17) is the maximum variation of\nelectric charge ( 1Qmax ) through the Cr capacitor, because∫To,eq/2\n0 ILr,pk_Tg sin\n(\nωo,eqt\n)\ndt =1Qmax =Cr ·2VCr,pk_Tg.\nThus, replacing the second integral by 1Qmax , the Cr capac-\nitance is determined (18) in regard to the design parame-\nters, such as: output power of the module (P o); MFT’s gain\n(n); peak value of the output voltage (V o,pk_Tg); peak value\nof the voltage across the Cr capacitor (V Cr,pk_Tg); and the\nswitching frequency (f s). It can be seen that the expression\nis independent of the equivalent frequency fo,eq, due to the\ncapacitor’s voltage ripple being independent of the shape of\nthe iLr current. Actually, it is only a function of the maximum\namount of exchanged charge.\nCr = n P o\n2fs Vo,pk_Tg VCr,pk_Tg\n(18)\nThe Lr inductor value can be determined by means of (19).\nOn the other hand, the Lr inductor can be the leakage induc-\ntance of the MFT transformer itself, in order to minimize\nthe losses and the volume of the converter. Then, it is not\nnecessary to have an additional inductor on the power circuit.\nThus, the leakage inductance of the MFT is determined in\nthe design stage, in which the Lr inductance is obtained by\nmeans of analytical methods, or by ﬁnite element software\nor via experimental measurements. Later, the calculation of\nthe required Cr capacitance is done by (4) and, then, the peak\nvalue of the voltage across Cr is obtained using (18).\nLr = 1\n4 π2 f 2o,eq Ceq\n(19)\n3) DESIGN EQUATION OF THE OUTPUT CAPACITOR\nThe main waveforms of the output port of the HSCSRC\nconverter are shown in Fig. 8 to obtain the design equation\nof the Co capacitor related to the output voltage ripple (1v o).\nThe waveforms at the switching period Ts are illustrated at the\npeak value of the output voltage (V o,pk_Tg), i.e., at the point\nwhere the higher voltage ripple is observed due to the higher\ncurrent ripple of the output io current.\nThe output voltage ripple can be obtained assuming that\nthe high frequency component of the io current passes only\nthrough the output Co capacitor. Moreover, for simplicity, the\nideal case where fo,eq =fs is considered, then, the current\nthrough the Co capacitor can be mathematically described\n(20), which results in the waveform of the Fig. 8(c).\niCo (t)=io (t)−|iRo (t)|\niCo (t)=\n⏐⏐sin\n(\nωgt\n)⏐\n⏐\n(ILr,pk_Tg\nn |sin (ωst)|−IRo,pk_Tg\n)\n,\n0 ≤t ≤Tg (20)\nThe current through the Co capacitor at the peak value\nof the output voltage, as well as at the switching period,\nis shown in Fig. 8(g).

(c) Second equivalent topological stage.\n4) ANALYSIS OF THE SC LADDER CELL\nThe analysis of the SC ladder cell can be performed assuming\nthat the LLC-SRC stage is a perfect sinusoidal current source\nbetween the a and b points, as shown in Fig. 9(a), with a\nfrequency equal to fo = 1\n2π√Lr Cr\n. In other words, only the\nfundamental component of the iLr current is represented in\nphase with the vab voltage. When neglecting the magnetizing\niLm current and the effect of the output Co capacitor on\nthe resonance frequency, the errors are relatively small in\ndetermining the voltages and currents in the SC ladder cell.\nThe peak value of the current source is determined accord-\ning to (6), in function of the grid period Tg. The equiv-\nalent circuits are illustrated in Fig. 9(b) and Fig. 9(c),\nwhere the voltage and current deﬁnitions for the theoreti-\ncal analysis are shown. It can be seen that the equivalent\ncircuits are symmetrical, and, then, the time constant of\nthe Csc capacitor are equal on both circuits. This symme-\ntry is beneﬁcial to the charge/discharge process of the SC\ncapacitor, resulting in lower current stresses and a better\nequilibrium on the voltage across the divider capacitors Cd1\nand Cd2.\nThe differential equation of the voltage across the Csc\ncapacitor (28) is obtained from the analysis of the equivalent\ncircuit shown in Fig. 9(b). On the second topological stage\n(Fig. 9(c)), the differential equation is the same. The divider\nCd1 and Cd2 capacitors are equal and deﬁned by Cd , the\ntime constant is determined by τ/α and the other deﬁnitions\nare presented in (28). The peak value of the iLr current\n(ILr,pk_Ts\n(\nωgt\n)\n) is considered inside the deﬁned δparameter,\nbecause at the switching period it is assumed constant. It can\nalso be noted that, due to the symmetry of the equivalent\ncircuits, as well as operation with a constant duty cycle of\n50%, the initial and ﬁnal voltages across the Cd1 and Cd2\ncapacitors are equal and deﬁned by VCd,max_Ts and VCd,min_Ts\n(see Fig. 5(g)). Moreover, the frequency of the voltage ripple\nacross the Csc capacitor is twice that the switching frequency\nfs, so that at each half switching period the vCsc voltage returns\nto its initial condition of VCsc,min_Ts (see Fig. 5(g)), which\n141190 VOLUME 8, 2020\nR.

After this, the rms value at the\nswitching period Ts is obtained, as well as the rms value at\nthe grid period Tg. Thus, the squared rms value (at the grid\nperiod) of the normalized iCsc current (I 2\nCsc,rms,norm), in which\nthe normalization was performed in regard to the peak value\nof the iLr current at the grid period\n(\nI2\nCsc,rms_Tg\nI2\nLr,pk_Tg\n)\n, is presented\nin (34), as shown at the bottom of the page, associated with\nfsτ, Kc and α parameters. Reminding as that α =1 +Kc\n2\nand Kc is the ratio between the capacitances Csc/Cd , and\nτ = CscRsc. The losses in the Rsc resistor are calculated\nthrough (35), as shown at the bottom of the page.\nThe multiplication of fs by τ is a design parameter that\ndeﬁnes the operation mode of the SC-based converters. The\noperation modes are classiﬁed as: Complete charge (CC)\nfsτ ≤0.1 (as deﬁned in [47]); Partial charge (PC) 0.1 <\nfsτ ≤ 1.44 (as deﬁned in [48]); and No charge (NC)\n1.44 < fsτ (as deﬁned in [48]). The operation modes have\na direct relationship with the shape of the current through\nthe SC capacitor, in which it can be exponential (CC mode),\nquasi-linear (PC mode) and constant (NC mode), as broadly\ndiscussed in [47]–[51]. The nomenclatures CC, PC and NC,\nwere introduced in the literature by [49], [51]. On the pro-\nposed |AC|-|AC| HSCSRC converter, due to the current source\ncharacteristics of the LLC-SRC stage, the vCsc voltage (29)\nand the iCsc current have sinusoidal and exponential compo-\nnents, so that the exponential component is highly sensitive\nto the fsτ parameter, i.e., with the CC, PC and NC operation\nmodes.\nI2\nCsc,rms,norm =\n( Kc\n16π√fsτ\n)2\n·\n[\n4π4(fsτ)3 +π2α2fsτ+2α3]\ne\nα\n2fsτ −\n(\n4π4(fsτ)3 +π2α2fsτ−α3)\n(\ne\nα\n2fsτ −1\n)[\nπ2(fsτ)2 +α2\n4\n]2 (34)\nPRsc =Rsc I2\nCsc,rms,norm I2\nLr,pk_Tg (35)\nVOLUME 8, 2020 141191\nR. L. DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\nUsually, on the DC-DC SC-based converters, the intrinsic\nRds resistance of the switches that compose the Rsc resistor\nshown in Fig. 9, because when associated with high Csc\ncapacitance values, the fsτ values higher than 0.1 are easily\nachieved, which leads to the PC/NC operation modes. How-\never, this is not possible on the |AC|-|AC| HSCSRC converter,\nbecause of the low capacitance values of the Csc, Cd1 and Cd2\ncapacitors (from the nF to tens of µF). Since these capacitors\nhave inﬂuence on the power factor seen by the grid, there is a\ncompromise on the capacitance values with the required input\npower factor. Thus, when combining the low capacitance\nvalues at the medium frequencies of 50 to 100 kHz, with the\nlow Rds resistances of the SiC switches, e.g., from 50 to 100\nm, extremely low fsτ values are acquired, in this way they\nresult in the CC operation mode, e.g., with 0.001 ≤fsτ ≤\n0.02 (high peak and rms current). For that reason, on the\nproposed |AC|-|AC| HSCSRC converter, the addition of an\nexternal Rsc resistor (with a value in the range of 1 to 10 )\nin series with the Csc capacitor is required, with the goal of\nminimizing the current stresses through the SC capacitor by\noperating in the PC/NC region with fsτ >0.1 (lower peak\nand rms current).\nThe normalized squared I2\nCsc,rms,norm value of the iCsc cur-\nrent in function of the fsτ and Kc parameters is shown in\nFig. 10. The losses in the Rsc resistor (35) are directly related\nto the illustrated surface in Fig. 10. Lets start the analysis\nat the boundary of the CC and PC modes (highlighted in\nFig. 10). It is observed that the higher Kc value (C sc > Cd ),\nthe higher the rms value of the current. On the other hand,\nif Kc <1 (Csc <Cd ), the rms value of the current decreases\nconsiderably, even at the CC mode. The operation point at the\nPC mode with fsτ =0.35 and Kc =1 is shown in Fig. 10,\nwhich leads to a normalized current I2\nCsc,rms,norm =1.17%.\nHowever, if Kc =0.5 and fsτ =0.163 (near the CC operation\nmode boundary), the same normalized current value of 1.17%\nis achieved. Then, it is possible to minimize the volume of\nthe converter, because lower capacitance values can be used\nin the capacitors due to the lower fsτ value, while the losses\nin the Rsc resistor are the same, because the normalized value\nI2\nCsc,rms,norm was not changed.\nStill looking at Fig. 10, if the designer wants to work with\nextremely low values of the normalized current by means of\nincreasing the fsτvalue (reminding as that τ =CscRsc), there\nis no advantage in using the Csc capacitor higher than the Cd\ncapacitor. If Kc >1 (C sc > Cd ), the rms value of the current\nis increased for any fsτ value, as can be easily visualized in\nthe region with 0.05 <fsτ <0.2 (from red to the cyan blue\ncolors on the surface in Fig. 10). As a conclusion, according\nto Fig. 10 the best design region is in the PC mode region\nwith Kc ≤1 and 0.1 <fsτ <0.5, because with these ranges\nthe lower rms I2\nCsc,rms,norm current values are obtained with a\ncompromise regarding power density and losses.\nThe voltage ripple across the divider Cd1 and Cd2 capac-\nitors is another important design parameter. So, from the\nanalysis of the circuit shown in Fig. 9(b), the Kirchhoff’s Cur-\nrent Law (KCL) is found (36), knowing that iCd1 =−i Cd2 ,\nFIGURE 10.

It is known that the ILr,pk_Ts(ωgt)\nvalue is maximum and equal to ILr,pk_Tg (12) current when\nωgt =π/2. Then, when integrating (37) into Ts/2, the varia-\ntion of charge through the Cd capacitor is found (38), which\nresults in (39), assuming that 1vCd =1vCd% VCd,pk_Tg.\n2iCd2 =iLr +iCsc (36)\n⟨\niCd2\n⟩\nTs/2 =1\n2\n2ILr,pk_Ts\n(\nωgt\n)\nπ (37)\nCd 1vCd =\nTs/2∫\n0\n⟨\niCd2\n⟩\nTs/2dt =\nTs/2∫\n0\nILr,pk_Tg\nπ dt (38)\n1vCd% =\nILr,pk_Tg\n2 π fs Cd VCd,pk_Tg\n(39)\nThe ﬁnal design equation of the SC ladder cell is the\nrelationship between the equivalent capacitance seen by the\ngrid (C eq,g) and the SST’s input power factor (PF ).

The iLr current with the effect of the magnetizing current.\nAt the dead time (1td ), theiLr current is, approximately, equal to the\npeak value of the magnetizing current (ILm,pk_Ts), enabling ZVS switching.\nseen in Fig. 12 along with the switches’ gate signals. At the\nend of the half cycle, during the dead time interval, the iLr\ncurrent is approximately equal to the peak value of the magne-\ntizing current (I Lm,pk_Ts). As a consequence, ZVS switching\ncan be performed on the switches S1,..,6.\nThe switching analysis is performed during the turn\noff transition of the even switches S2,4,6. The switch-\ning of the odd switches S1,3,5 are similar to the even\nswitches, but the magnetizing current ﬂows in the oppo-\nsite direction. Moreover, for the sake of simplicity, the\nmagnetizing current is assumed constant (I Lm,pk_Ts) dur-\ning the dead time and the intrinsic Coss capacitance of the\nMOSFETs are identical. The equivalent circuits during the\nswitching can be seen in Fig. 13(a)-(b), where the Csc,\nCd1 and Cd2 capacitors are replaced by voltage sources,\nbecause Cd ≫ Coss and Csc ≫ Coss, and the switches\nS1,..,6 are replaced by their intrinsic capacitances (C S1,..,6).\nThe voltage waveform across the switches are shown\nin Fig. 13(c).\nThe switching process can be split into two stages. The\nequivalent circuit of the ﬁrst stage is shown in Fig. 13(a),\nwhose time interval is deﬁned as 1tS5,6 . The ILm,pk_Ts cur-\nrent is equally divided in the a node and, then, the current\nthrough the CS5 and CS6 capacitors are equal to ILm,pk_Ts/2,\nas illustrated in Fig. 13(a). Accordingly, the CS5 and CS6\ncapacitors are linearly discharged and charged, respectively.\nThe voltages across the switches S5 and S6 are shown in\nFig. 13(c). Therefore, the switching time of the switches S5\nand S6 is calculated through\n1tS5,6 =Coss\n(\nViM,Ts/2\n)\nILm,pk_Ts/2 =Coss ViM,Ts\nILm,pk_Ts\n, (42)\nFIGURE 13.

From the waveform analysis, it can be noted that the\nswitching time of the switchesS5 and S6 is lower than the switches\nS1,..,4.\nin which the peak value ILm,pk_Ts of the magnetizing current\nis obtained from (43), leading to (44).\n2ILm,pk_Ts =\n(\nViM,Ts/2\n)\n(Ts/2)\nLm\n(43)\nILm,pk_Ts =ViM,Ts\n8Lm fs\n(44)\nThus, applying (44) into (42), the switching time 1tS5,6 of\nthe switches S5 and S6 is found (45).\n1tS5,6 =8 Coss Lm fs (45)\nThe switching process of the switches S1,..,4 are similar to\nthe switches S5,6, but the current through the intrinsic capac-\nitors of the switches S1,..,4 is equal to ILm,pk_Ts/4, because\nthe ILm,pk_Ts/2 current is halved again among the capacitors\nCS1,2 and CS3,4, as shown in Fig. 13(a). When the CS5\ncapacitor is fully discharged, at the end of the time interval\n1tS5,6 , the intrinsic diode of the switch S5 (DS5) is forward-\nbiased, so that the current through the capacitors CS1,..,4\nremains the same (I Lm,pk_Ts/4), as illustrated in Fig. 13(b).\nThus, the switching time of the switches S1,..,4 (1tS1,..,4 )\nVOLUME 8, 2020 141193\nR.

Thus, to complete the ZVS switching\non all switches, it is necessary that 1td >1t S1,..,4 .\n1tS1,..,4 =2 1tS5,6 (47)\nThe switching analysis presented herein was performed\nconsidering an operation point at a switching period Ts of\nthe rectiﬁed |AC| input voltage (V iM ,Ts) of the HSCSRC con-\nverter. However, the intrinsic Coss capacitance of the switches\nhave non-linear behavior in regard to the Vds voltage across\nthe switch (a well known phenomena). Then, due to the\nlow frequency envelope of the input voltage (the 120 Hz\nfrequency component), the switches’ capacitance changes in\nfunction of the angular ωg frequency of the input voltage.\nAs a consequence, the switching times could be rewritten\nas 1tS1,..,4\n(\nωgt\n)\n= 16 Coss\n(\nωgt\n)\nLm fs, representing\nthe switching time variation regarding the angular frequency\ndue to the capacitance change. The critical point is at the\nzero-crossing region of the input voltage, where the switches’\nintrinsic capacitance goes towards high values. A solution to\nthis problem is using variable dead time according to angular\nfrequency, as presented in [17], to guarantee ZVS switching\nover the entire grid period. Thus, the dead time 1td would\nbe increased at the zero-crossing region of the input voltage.\nHowever, in this scenario the constant dead time approach is\nused, assuming that partial-ZVS switching will occur at the\nzero-crossing region of the input voltage.\nIV. DESIGN METHODOLOGY\nBased on the theoretical analysis presented in section III, the\ndesign methodology of the modules that compose the ISOP\narrangement of the proposed SST (Fig. 2) will be shown.\nInitially, a case study regarding the number of modules (n m)\nand the SiC switches available on the market that can be\nemployed on the MV side of the converter are discussed.\nAfter this, the design methodology of the HSCSRC converter\nis covered. The reduced scale prototype was developed for\nthe validation of the theoretical analysis and experimental\nveriﬁcation of the proposed converter. For that reason, the\nrequired insulation levels regarding 15 kV voltage class was\nnot covered, and it is under development in the full-scale\nprototype (such as the MFT’s insulation design). On the other\nhand, the electronic components employed in the reduced\nscale prototype are suitable for the full scale version of the\nSST, such as the capacitors and switches that will be shown\non the following topics.\nA. SiC SWITCHES AND THE NUMBER OF MODULES\nNowadays, the SiC technologies available on the market\nare limited to the drain-to-source voltages of 1.7 kV and\n1.2 kV . There are efforts of big companies in the research\nand development of 10-15 kV SiC switches, as already dis-\ncussed, but they are not yet commercialized. In general, on the\nlargest electronic component vendors, it can be seen that the\n1.7 kV SiC switch’s cost is almost three-times of the 1.2 kV\nSiC device, when comparing switches with similar values of\ndrain-to-source Rds resistance, e.g., the series C2M0080170P\nof 1.7 kV with 80 m @ 25◦C and the series C3M0075120K\nof 1.2 kV and 75 m @ 25◦C.\nTwo different solutions with those SiC devices of 1.7 kV\nand 1.2 kV are presented in Table 1, to verify which switch is\nbetter for the proposed SST on the ISOP arrangement (Fig. 2)\nparticular for the costs and losses. The switches were selected\nwith the same package type and with similar series, but\nwith voltage/current ratings more suitable for each situation.\nIn each case, the maximum allowed voltage across the S1,..,6\nswitches was 70% regarding the switch’s maximum drain-to-\nsource voltage of 1.7 kV or 1.2 kV . As a consequence, it leads\nto twelve modules with the 1.2 kV switches and nine modules\nwith the 1.7 kV switches, as shown in Table 1. The same\ncriteria were adopted when choosing the IGBTs technology\nto implement the folding bridge’s switches (S f 1,..,4).\nDifferent module’s voltage, current, and power levels are\nshown in Table 1 for each case with a distinct number of\nmodules nm. Ideally, when the modules’ input voltages are\nequally divided on the ISOP arrangement, the efﬁciency of\none module represents the overall efﬁciency of the full con-\nﬁguration, as experimentally veriﬁed in [22], [43]. Thus, the\nanalysis of the losses along with the costs can be performed\nto choose the best solution regarding an SiC switch and the\nnumber of modules.\nThe conduction losses of the switches S5, S6, and So1,..,4\nare analyzed. The current stresses are calculated through (48)\nin function of the ILr,pk_Tg peak value (12). However, for\nsimpliﬁcation, the ideal case of fs = fo,eq is considered,\nleading to (49). The calculation of the average value of the\ncurrent through the Sf 1,..,4 switches is performed in (50). The\ncurrent stresses of the different cases were shown in Table 1.\nIS5,6,rms =\n√\nfs\nfo,eq\nILr,pk_Tg\n2\n√\n2\nISo1,..,4,rms =\n√\nfs\nfo,eq\nILr,pk_Tg\n2n\n√\n2\n(48)\nIS5,6,rms,ideal = n πPo\n2\n√\n2 Vo,pk_Tg\nISo1,..,4,rms,ideal = πPo\n2\n√\n2 Vo,pk_Tg\n(49)\nISf 1,2,3,4,avg = n P o\nπ Vo,pk_Tg\n(50)\nThe SC ladder cell’s switches S1,..,4 currents are related to\nthe current through the Csc capacitor, as can be seen on the\ntopological stages shown in Fig. 5(a)-(b). In each operation\nstage, the current through the S2 and S3 switches is equal to\niCsc current, while in the switches S1 and S4 the current is\ncomposed of iCsc and iLr . When the SC ladder cell’s operation\n141194 VOLUME 8, 2020\nR. L. DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\nTABLE 1.

The single-phase SST rated power is 20 kW and the\nline-to-line input voltage is 13.8 kV.\nmode is properly designed (e.g., the PC or NC region), the\nmagnitude of the iCsc current is much lower than the iLr cur-\nrent. Then, the current stresses through the S1 and S4 switches\nare approximately the same as the S5 and S6 switches, while\nin the S2 and S3 switches the current stresses are insigniﬁcant.\nThus, at this moment the conduction losses in the S2 and\nS3 switches are neglected and the losses in the S1, S4, S5\nand S6 switches are assumed equal. The switching losses are\nalso neglected, due to partial-ZVS and ZCS switching in the\nHSCSRC converter.\nThe conduction losses in each case are shown in Fig. 14.\nAs can be seen, regarding the output power of each case, the\ntotal losses with 12 modules are higher in percentage than the\ncase with 9 modules. As a consequence of the higher losses\nin the So1,..,4 switches of the case with 12 modules due to the\nhigher Rds resistance of the switches (see Table 1). Moreover,\nthe conduction losses of the LV side’s switches are the efﬁ-\nciency bottleneck, but it can be overcome using switches with\nlower Rds resistance values, expecting cost increase given the\nlarge switch count on the ISOP arrangement.\nFIGURE 14. Total conduction losses in the modules’ switches for reported\ncases in Table 1. (a) Case with 12 modules. It has the higher total\npercentage losses regarding the output power of each module, due to the\nhigher percentage losses of the LV CoolMOS switchesSo1,..,4. (b) Case\nwith 9 modules. It has the lower total percentage losses, which would\nresult in better efficiency results than the other studied case.\nThe total costs for each case regarding switches are shown\nin Table 2. The quantity and unit price of the switches are\nlisted as well. From the data presented in Table 2, the nor-\nmalized cost per module (US$/mod) along with the total\nswitches’ quantity (Qty) of the single-phase SST are illus-\ntrated in Fig. 15. It can be seen that, despite the lower number\nof modules and reduced switch count, the 9 modules scheme\nis more expensive than the 12 modules solution, because\nthe unit price of the IGBTs switches of 3.6 kV and the 1.7\nkV SiC switches are, respectively, twice and three times\nhigher than the 12 modules scheme. Consequently, the cost\nof the 9 modules solution is 75% higher.\nIn this way, after the losses and cost analysis, it can be seen\nthat the case with twelve modules using the SiC switches\nof 1.2 kV is the best solution regarding costs, even when\nemploying a higher number of modules. The speciﬁcations\nand design parameters of one module that composes the\nsingle-phase ISOP arrangement with 12 modules are shown\nin Table 3.\nB.

The capacitance range is\n1.35 µF ≥Cd,max ≥0.15 µF (according to (52)) corresponding a\nfrequency sweep of 46.6kHz ≤fs,min ≤420 kHz. WhenCd,max =1 µF\nyields fs,min =63 kHz, while forCd,max =0.5 µF leads to\nfs,min =126 kHz. For eachRsc value, there is a correspondingfsτ\nparameter (Rsc =5 / fsτ =0.315, Rsc =10 / fsτ =0.63, Rsc =15 /\nfsτ =0.945, Rsc =20 / fsτ =1.26).\nI2\nCsc,rms,norm current (34), in which is related to the fsτparam-\neter (reminding as that τ =RscCd , Cd =Csc). Thus, the\nPRsc losses linked to the Rsc and Cd,max values are shown\nin Fig. 16, in which the sweep of the switching frequency\nis performed varying the Cd,max value in (53) (so that the\ndeﬁned 1vCd % value is satisﬁed).\nOn each point of the surface shown in Fig. 16, there is a\ncorresponding fs,min frequency related to the Cd,max value by\nmeans of (53). For each Rsc value, different fsτ parameters\nare also found (parameter that deﬁnes the operation mode of\nthe switched capacitor). As a conclusion evident in Fig. 16,\nthe different values of capacitance and switching frequency\nyield the same PRsc losses. It can be seen that for values\nhigher than Rsc ≥3 , the design criteria of PRsc % ≤0.25%\nis achieved (P Rsc ≤ 4.17 W) and the PC operation mode\nwith 0.1 ≤fsτ ≤0.5 is satisﬁed as well (f sτ =0.189 at\nRsc =3 ). Therefore, two surface mounted device (SMD)\nresistors in parallel connection of 10 and with rated power\nof 3 W were employed to compose the Rsc resistor of 5 ,\nwhich leads to a maximum loss of 2.953 W (as highlighted in\nFig. 16) and the fsτ =0.315.\nThe proposed design methodology of the Rsc resistor\nenables the free variation of the Cd capacitance and the fs\nfrequency, as long as the minimum and maximum values of\nfs,min =46 kHz and Cd,max =1.368 µF are respected. Then,\nthe volume of the Cd and Csc capacitors can be minimized,\nand the MFT’s design can be optimized as well.\n3) SC LADDER CELL’S CAPACITORS CHOICE\nThe low Cd capacitance values (lower than 0.5 µF) yields\nhigh switching frequencies (higher than 126 kHz). For exam-\nple, in the MFT transformer it can be a problem regarding\ncore and winding losses due to reinforcement of skin and\nproximity effects. Thus, Cd,max capacitance values between\n0.5 µF and 1.386 µF should be chosen, yielding the switching\nfrequency range in (54) (calculated using (53)).\n46 kHz ≤fs ≤126 kHz (54)\nThe rms current stresses at the grid period through the\ndivider capacitors Cd1 and Cd2 (ICd,rms_Tg) (55) were found\nusing the same calculation method shown in section III to\nﬁnd the iCsc current through the Csc capacitor. However,\nassuming that Kc =1 as previously deﬁned, which leads to\nα=3/2 (reminding as that Kc and αparameters were deﬁned\nin the vCsc voltage’s differential equation (28)). The ICd,rms_Tg\ncurrent (55) is related to the design parameters deﬁned in\nTable 3 and associated with fsτ as well. As discussed in the\nRsc resistor’s calculation, the corresponding fsτvalue is 0.315\nwhen Rsc is equal to 5 . Then, using the design parameters\nin Table 3 and considering fsτ =0.315 in (55), the ICd,rms_Tg\nvalue of 1.607 A is found. Similarly, when applying those\nvalues in (34), the ICsc,rms value of 0.77 A is found as well.\nICd,rms_Tg = n πPo\n4Vo,pk_Tg\n√fsτ\n·\n√\n(K4 +K5)e\n3\n4fsτ −(K4 −K5)\n(\ne\n3\n4fsτ −1\n)[\nπ2(fsτ)2 +9\n16\n]2\nK4 =π4(fsτ)5 +13\n16π2(fsτ)3 + 9\n64 (fsτ)\nK5 =9\n8(fsτ)2 + 27\n256π2 (55)\nThe ﬁlm capacitor technology was chosen due to higher\nrated voltages with reduced volume and the lower equivalent\nseries resistance (ESR) compared to electrolytic capacitors,\nwhich leads to better current ratings as well. Thus, consider-\ning the deﬁned capacitance range, regarding the calculated\nfrequency range in (54), the voltage stresses and the rms\ncurrent values (I Cd,rms_Tg of 1.607 A, and ICsc,rms of 0.77 A),\nthe KEMET R76 capacitor series was the suitable one among\nothers analyzed. Two capacitors on parallel connection with\n0.47 µF each were chosen, which yields Cd = Csc =\n0.94 µF. The rated voltages of these capacitors are: DC\nvoltage of 1600 V; and rms voltage of 650 V .\nWhen the Cd capacitance is known, the fsτ = 0.315\nremains the same, but the minimum switching frequency\nmust be recalculated using (53), which yields fs,min =67 kHz\nwhen Cd =Csc =0.94 µF.\n4) OUTPUT CAPACITOR\nThe output Co capacitor is designed considering the minimum\nswitching frequency of 67 kHz recalculated in the previous\ntopic. Then, applying the design parameters of the Table 3\ninto (27), the minimum output Co,min capacitance is found\n(56). Thus, the value of 2 µF and ﬁlm capacitor technology\n(KEMET series C4ASMBW4200A3HJ) were chosen as well.\nCo,min =\narcsin\n(\n2\nπ\n)\nPo\nπfs,min 1vo% V 2\no,pk_Tg\n=1.128 µF (56)\nVOLUME 8, 2020 141197\nR.

TRANSFORMER CHARACTERISTICS AND SERIES\nELEMENTS DESIGN\nThe electrical insulation of the MFT transformers that com-\npose the SSTs must be in accordance with the existing stan-\ndards of LFTs, such as IEEE Std. C57.12.01 for dry-type\npower transformers. As a consequence, the constructive\naspects should be carefully designed, specially the wind-\ning arrangements in order to acquire the desired insulation\nregarding applied voltage and basic insulation level (BIL).\nIn the 15 kV voltage class, e.g., the applied voltage between\nthe MV and LV sides is 34 kV and the BIL level is +/−\n95 kV . There are several MFT’s prototypes presented in the\nliterature with the insulation requirements according to IEEE\nStd. C57.12.01 [20], [52], [53]. Design and manufacturing\nmethods regarding insulation are subjects of research as well\n[20], [32], [52]–[54]. Usually, as a result of the high insula-\ntion, high leakage inductance is observed and, so, it can be\nused as the resonant Lr inductor of the HSCSRC converter.\nIn this way, insulation distances among the MV and LV\nwindings and the core, along with the leakage inductance\nof the transformer, become design parameters. Although all\nthose constructive aspects are out of the scope of this article,\nsome important points will be shown, such as the MFT’s gain\nwith high leakage inductance and the ﬂow chart design, that\nis presented in Fig. 18.\nThe MFT transformer of the HSCSRC converter’s reduced\nscale prototype is illustrated in Fig. 17. The slotted bob-\nbin assembly method along with the economic transformer\ndesign (ETD) ferrite core were chosen. Thus, the MV side’s\nwinding is separated from the LV side by an insulator. It is a\nwell known solution in the literature regarding LLC convert-\ners, also called as magnetic integration in LLC converters,\npresented in [55], where the Lr inductor is implemented\nusing the leakage inductance of the MFT. The effect of the\nmagnetic integration is a boost to the transformer gain (n int ),\nanalyzed in [55] and determined by (57) in an all primary\nreferred transformer model (such as illustrated in Fig. 3),\nwhere Lr and Lm are the all primary referred leakage and\nmagnetizing inductances, respectively, and nt represents the\ntransformer turns ratio ( nt =Ns/Np). Thus, the static gain of\nthe HSCSRC converter must be determined as in (58), so that\nthe ratio between the Lr and Lm inductances (deﬁned as the\nλparameter) have inﬂuence on the acquired output voltage,\nbecause the λparameter modiﬁes the transformer gain (n int )\nand, consequently, the converter’s gain.\nnint (nt ,λ) = nt\n√\n1 −λ\n, λ =Lr\nLm\n(57)\nGHSCSRC,int = Vo,pk_Tg\nViM,pk_Tg\n=n\n2 =nint (nt ,λ)\n2 (58)\nThe leakage inductance of the transformer shown in Fig. 17\ncan be found calculating the energy of the magnetic ﬁeld in\nthe window area, as presented in [55], yielding (59), in which\ndh,p is the height of the primary side’s bobbin, dh,s is the\nheight of the secondary side’s bobbin, dins is the thickness of\nthe insulating material, dw is the window width of the core,\nNp represents the primary turns, MLT is the mean length of\na turn, and µo is the air magnetic permeability. The magne-\ntizing inductance Lm is found from the reluctance of the gap,\nwhere the fringing ﬂux is neglected, yielding (60), in which\ndgap is the gap’s thickness and Ae is the cross-sectional area of\nthe core. This simpliﬁed calculation is valid for dgap\ndh,tot ≤0.01\n[56], in which dh,tot is the sum of dh,p, dh,s and dins. For values\nhigher than that ratio, a model that includes the fringing ﬂux\nis required, but the maximum gap distance was deﬁned as\nequal to that ratio.\nLr ∼=\nµoN2\np\n3 dW\n[\nMLTp\n(\ndh,p +3 dins\n)\n+MLTs dh,s\n]\n(59)\nLm =\nN2\np\nℜgap\n, ℜgap ∼\n= 1\nµoAe\n(\ndgap +dgap\n2\n)\n(60)\nThe magnetizing Lm inductance is a design parameter\nrelated to the switching time 1tS1,2,3,4 calculated in (46). This\nswitching time was deﬁned as equal to 2.5% of the total\nswitching period Ts into (46), which leads to (61). The Coss\ncapacitance is corrected to a quarter of the maximum voltage\nacross the switch, in which Coss,data and Vds,data are taken\nfrom the datasheet of the switch. Therefore, the gap thickness\nis found equating (60) and (61), yielding (62).\nLm = 2.5%Ts\n16Cossfs\n, Coss =2Coss,data\n√\nVds,data\n1\n4\nViM,pk_Tg\n2\n(61)\ndgap =\n32µo Ae N2\np Coss fs\n3 (2.5%Ts) (62)\nFinally the switching fs frequency is deﬁned regarding the\nMFT’s design, which is performed according to the ﬂowchart\nshown in Fig. 18. So, after many iterations, the fs frequency\nof 75 kHz was found. A summary of the main parameters of\nthe MFT along with theoretical results is presented in Table 4.\n141198 VOLUME 8, 2020\nR. L. DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\nFIGURE 18. Medium frequency transformer flow chart design.\nThe calculation of Lr using (59) (theoretical value of\n146 µH) can lead to errors of about 30%. In practice,\nafter acquiring the leakage inductance of the MFT through\nan impedance analyzer, the resonant Cr capacitor must\nbe adjusted to obtain the desired resonance fo frequency.\nThus, a capacitance range (63) can be found using fs =\n1\n2π√Lr Cr\n, considering an error of +/−30% regarding Lr\ninductance.

LOSSES DISTRIBUTION\nAfter all the design steps previously described, the parameters\nof the HSCSRC converter are known, then, the losses analysis\nwas performed and shown in Fig. 19. The fsτparameter of the\nSC ladder cell must be recalculated regarding the switching\nfrequency of 75 kHz deﬁned in the last design stage, which\nleads to fsτ =0.352 (reminding as that the previous value\nwas 0.315 regarding fs,min =67 kHz).\nIn the stages synchronized with the grid (Folding and\nUnfolding bridges), the conduction losses were determined,\nwhile the switching losses were neglected since those stages\nwork at low frequency and the switching happens at the\nzero-crossing of the grid’s voltage. In the MF stage performed\nthrough the HSCSRC converter, the losses in the MFT trans-\nformer, switches, and capacitors were found. The conduction\nlosses in the SiC switches on the MV side (S 1,..,6) and in the\nCoolMOS switches on the LV side (S o1,..,4) were calculated\nVOLUME 8, 2020 141199\nR. L. DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\nFIGURE 19. Graphical representation of the theoretical losses at the rated\npower of the designed prototype. The losses in the Folding and Unfolding\nbridges, as also in the HSCSRC converter, were found. In the MFT\ntransformer, the core and winding losses were determined using the\nmethods presented in [57] and [58], respectively. The theoretical\nefficiency resulted in 96.61%.\nrelated to the rms value of the iLr current. The current stresses\nwere determined in (48), while the current stresses through\nthe S2 and S3 switches were found regarding the iCsc current\n(34), which in turn was also found related to the iLr cur-\nrent. Despite the ZCS switching, on the LV side’s switches\n(So1,..,4) the switching losses regarding the Coss capacitance\nwere accounted for (total of 1.58 W regarding four switches).\nThe same loss calculation were done for the S1,..,6 switches\non the MV side, in which ZCS and partial-ZVS switching\nare performed. When calculating the losses due to the Coss\ncapacitance (total of 2.3 W regarding six switches), the volt-\nage across the S1,..,6 switches was assumed as equal to a\nquarter of the maximum voltage, the estimated point where\nthe ZVS switching is lost due to the signiﬁcant rise of the Coss\ncapacitance (the non-linear variation regarding the module’s\nrectiﬁed input voltage as previously discussed). The losses in\nthe Rsc resistor are calculated using (35).\nWhen analyzing Fig. 19, it can be noted that the higher\nlosses are on the LV side, 35% in the IGBT Su1,..,4 switches\nof the Unfolding bridge and 30% in the CoolMOS So1,..,4\nswitches of the HSCSRC converter, hence a 65% of the total\nlosses. So, the bottleneck to increasing the efﬁciency of the\nSST is to optimize the losses in the switches on the LV\nside, due to the higher conduction losses. Nevertheless, the\ntheoretical efﬁciency results in 96.61%.\nV. PROTOTYPE, SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL\nRESULTS\nThe reduced scale prototype built to experimental validation\nof the proposed SST’s main block of energy conversion,\nas well as to experimental validation of the presented theo-\nretical analysis and design methodology, is shown in Fig. 20.\nThe main speciﬁcations were summarized in Table 3.

THEORETICAL EQUATIONS VALIDATION\nA simulation of the single-phase/module SST (Fig. 20(a))\nwas performed on the PSIM software with the speciﬁcations\nin Table 3 and components in Table 5 to verify the accuracy\nof the equations presented in section III. Thus, a comparison\nis shown among the theoretical and simulation results in\nTable 6. Errors of about 12% can be observed, due to sev-\neral simpliﬁcations performed during the analysis, e.g., the\nreplacement of the resonant stage of the HSCSRC converter\nby a sinusoidal current source in-phase with the vab voltage\n(Fig. 9) in order to obtain the voltage and currents of the SC\nladder cell. Some parameters neglected during the theoretical\nstatic analysis, such as: the drain-to-source Rds resistance of\nthe switches, the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the\ncapacitors, and the dead time, were considered in simulation,\nwhich affects the results. On the other hand, due to the\nanalysis complexity of the structure, the theoretical results are\nsatisfactory.\nB. EXPERIMENTAL WAVEFORMS\nThe experimentation was performed using the Itech IT7326\nAC power supply (maximum values of 300 V AC and 3 kV A)\nalong with a step-up LF transformer for the generation of\nthe module’s input viM voltage of 1.15 kV . The results\nwere taken with a resistive load. The input ﬁlter com-\nposed of the Lg inductor shown in Fig. 20(a) represents\nthe leakage inductance of the step-up transformer itself\n(12.5 mH @ 60 Hz).\nTABLE 6. Comparison among theoretical and numerical simulation\nresults of the current and voltage stresses at the rated power. The voltage\nripples were also evaluated.\nFIGURE 21. The waveforms show the input/output voltages and currents\nof the SST at the grid frequency with the output power of 1 kW. Input (viM\n- 420 V/div) and output (vo - 250 V/div) voltages. Input (ig - 2 A/div) and\nload (iRo - 3 A/div) currents. Time scale (4 ms/div). It can be seen that the\ninput/output voltages are in-phase, while the grid current leads theviM\nvoltage due to the capacitive behavior of the HSCSRC converter.\nThe SST’s input (v iM ) and output (v o) voltages, as well as\nthe input current (i g) and the load current (i Ro ) are shown in\nFig. 21. The input current is the grid ig current itself (on the\nMV side) because it does not change when another module\nis associated with the ISOP arrangement shown in Fig. 2.\nIt can be noted that the proposed SST, which is composed of\nthe Folding/Unfolding bridges along with the HSCSRC con-\nverter, does not impose any signiﬁcant distortion on the grid\nig current and output vo voltage. When feeding resistive loads,\nthe ig current always leads the input viM voltage by an angle\nrelated to the displacement power factor, due to the capacitive\ncharacteristics of the HSCSRC converter. It can be observed\nthat the output (v o) and input (v iM ) voltages are in phase\ndisposition as well, validating the Folding/Unfolding bridges\nsynchronous operation with the grid’s voltage. In addition,\nwe can verify that the HSCSRC converter does not impose\nphase-shift on the voltages due to the operation at near the\nresonance frequency (f s/fo =0.974).\nThe iLr current measured directly on the primary side of\nthe MFT transformer is shown in Fig. 22(a) along with the vab\nand vcd voltages (see Fig. 20(a) e Fig. 5(a),(b) e (d)).

(b) Voltage\nacross theCr capacitor (vCr - 250 V/div) and current through the primary\nside of the MFT transformer (iLr - 2 A/div).\nbe seen, the vab and vcd voltages are in-phase, which means\nthat the HSCSRC converter is working near the resonance\nfrequency of the series elements Lr and Cr , resulting in null\nimpedance in the iLr current path. The shape of the iLr current\nis similar to the predicted waveform shown in the theoretical\nanalysis, it can be compared with the waveform shown in\nFig. 5(d). The iLr current along with the vCr voltage are\nshown in Fig. 22(b). The shape of the vCr voltage is close\nto a perfectly sinusoidal waveform, and it is another example\nof working near the resonance frequency. At this operation\npoint with the Po ∼=1 kW, the experimental peak value of the\nvCr voltage is 275 V , while the calculation through (18) leads\nto 256 V . The same comparison is done with the peak value of\nthe iLr current. The experimental measurement resulted in 4.8\nA, while the theoretical calculation through (12) leads to 4.5\nA. The theoretical predictions perform well with the experi-\nmental measurements. Still looking at Fig. 22, the frequency\ncomponent of 120 Hz can be seen in all high-frequency\nvariables, as previously discussed in the theoretical\nanalysis.\nFIGURE 23. Switched capacitor ladder cell experimental results of the\nHSCSRC converter at the output power of 1 kW. (a) Voltage across the\ncapacitor Cd1 (vCd1 - 250 V/div) andCd2 (vCd2 - 250 V/div).

The peak values are half of the input viM voltage, the\nsame as in the switches S1,..,6 on the MV side. The voltage\nbalance is guaranteed through the switched capacitor Csc at\nany operation point and it is load-independent. Moreover,\nthe 120 Hz envelope of the |AC|-|AC| HSCSRC converter can\nbe seen as well. In Fig. 23(b), the iLr current and the vRsc volt-\nage across the Rsc resistor are shown. The Rsc resistor of 5 \nis responsible for adjusting the fsτparameter, to guarantee the\noperation of the SC ladder cell in the PC region (f sτ =0.352)\nwith reduced current stresses, as discussed in the theoretical\nanalysis and design methodology sections. The waveform of\nthe iCsc current that ﬂows through the Csc capacitor is equal\nto the vRsc voltage, but divided by the 5 resistance. This\nexperimental waveform can be compared to the theoretical\none in Fig. 5(h).\nThe voltage stresses across the switches S1 and S2 on the\nMV side of the HSCSRC converter (see Fig. 20(a) for refer-\nence) are shown in Fig. 24(a). It is veriﬁed that the voltage\nacross the switches are half of the input viM voltage and\nthe switching happens at the zero-crossing of the iLr current.\nThe waveforms across the switches S3 and S4 are analogous\nto the the switches S1 and S2, respectively.

The gap thickness of the MFT transformer was found\nregarding the necessary Lm inductance to perform the ZVS\nswitching during that time interval. Thus, the dead time was\nadjusted as equal to 350 ns. However, in Fig. 24(b) it can be\nseen that the ZVS switching is not complete, because the S1\nswitch is turned on while the vS1 voltage is still around 250 V ,\nequivalent to, approximately, a third of the vS1 voltage. Never-\ntheless the ZVS switching is partial, the switching losses can\nbe neglected, due to the low voltage and low current values\nat that point. Another dead time value equal to 500 ns was\nevaluated as well, to guarantee the full ZVS switching in the\nS1,..,4 switches, but the efﬁciency results were not positively\naffected. Then, the designed value of 350 ns was chosen. Still\nlooking at Fig. 24, despite the partial-ZVS switching it can be\nseen that there are no voltage spikes on the voltage across the\nswitches. The measurements were performed by means of the\nTHDP0200 active differential probe using its full bandwidth\nof 200 MHz.\nThe voltage stresses across the switches S5 and S6 are\nshown in Fig. 25.

Above 30% of the output power (0.5\nkW) the efficiency is higher than 96%, which its maximum value is 97% at\n73.5% of the output power.\nFIGURE 27. Graphical 3D representation through CAD software of the\nsingle-phase SST composed of twelve modules on the ISOP arrangement\nshown in Fig. 2. (a) The cabinet integration for operation at 13.8 kV/220 V\n@ 20 kW of twelve modules along with the Unfolding bridge and the\nauxiliary transformers for MV measurement and auxiliary power\nsupply (APS) implementation. (b) The MFT transformer with an insulation\ndesign for the 15 kV voltage class according to IEEE Std. C57.12.01.. The\nMV/LV bushings and the coil former will be developed using the Selective\nLaser Sintering (SLS) technology with polyamide material. The\nslotted-bobbin assembly method on the core type transformer was\nchosen with the core model U 93/76/30 with I 93/28/30.\nwent to a temperature steady-state. Then, after 60 minutes of\nworking with an overload of 6.2% (output power of 1.77 kW),\nthe load was gradually reduced and the efﬁciency points were\nrecorded. Under overload, the efﬁciency was 96.7% and the\nmaximum efﬁciency was 97% for an output power of 1225 W\n(73.5% of the rated power). The efﬁciency is 96.77% at the\nrated power of 1.67 kW, and it is higher than 96% for a wide\nload range. After 60 minutes, the temperature rise of the MFT\ntransformer was 57 ◦C (under room temperature of 23 ◦C),\nwhile the predicted temperature rise was 68 ◦C for the room\ntemperature of 40 ◦C.\nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nA three-phase SST ISOP architecture based on the HSCSRC\nconverter was proposed. The modules that are used in the\nISOP scheme, which are composed of the front-end AC-|AC|\nrectiﬁer and the |AC|-|AC| HSCSRC converter, were ana-\nlyzed, designed and veriﬁed, as well as an |AC|-AC unfold-\ning bridge was designed and veriﬁed for validation of the\nsingle-phase and single-module reduced scale SST proof of\nconcept prototype. One of the main advantages of the pro-\nposed SST based on the HSCSRC converter is the reduction\nof the number of modules when comparing it to other SSTs\nbased on the FB and HB topologies, due to halving the voltage\nstress across the switches on the MV side. Reduced module\ncount is very important regarding reliability and power den-\nsity. Moreover, the voltage balance among the switches and\nthe divider capacitors are guaranteed through the switched\ncapacitor’s principle of operation. The simplest PWM modu-\nlation with both constant duty cycle and switching frequency\nis employed. Another advantage is the full or partial-ZVS\nswitching on the MV side’s switches, as shown in the exper-\nimental results, along with the ZCS switching in all switches\nof the HSCSRC converter, due to working near the resonance\nfrequency. This feature leads to a quiet converter regarding\nelectromagnetic compatibility. The proposed architecture is\nsuitable for line frequency in the range of 16 Hz to 400 Hz.\nThe theoretical analysis and design methodology were\nvalidated through simulation and experimental results. The\nSST presented a maximum efﬁciency of 97%, and the critical\npoint regarding efﬁciency was identiﬁed as the conduction\nlosses on the LV side’s switches. Thus, if higher efﬁciency\nis needed, the switches with lower Rds resistances must be\nemployed in the synchronous rectiﬁer, or even use switches\nin parallel connection, expecting cost increase. The proposed\ndesign methodology enables the free variation of the switch-\ning frequency in the MFT transformer’s design stage, respect-\ning the minimum switching frequency found regarding the\ndesign speciﬁcations. This enables an optimum design of the\nMFT transformer, which is the heart of the proposed SST.\nThus, the SC ladder cell’s components were designed related\nto the fsτ parameter, input power factor, and the losses in\nthe Rsc resistor. That resistor is purposely added to a series\nconnection with the Csc capacitor for a suitable design of\nthe operation mode of the switched capacitor (the PC mode).\nThe case study presented in the design methodology section\nhas shown that the 1.2 kV SiC MOSFET is suitable for the\nproposed distribution grid application, regarding cost and\nefﬁciency when compared to the 1.7 kV SiC technology. Even\nwhen employing a higher number of modules, the solution\nwith twelve modules using the 1.2 kV SiC switches is bet-\nter than the case with nine modules employing the 1.7 kV\nswitches, because it leads to similar losses with lower costs\n(43% lower).\n141204 VOLUME 8, 2020\nR. L. DA Silvaet al.: SST for Power Distribution Grid Based on a Hybrid Switched-Capacitor LLC-SRC Converter\nThe medium voltage dry-type prototype of the single-phase\nSST composed of twelve modules is under development, but\na 3D graphical representation of the mechanical structure\ndesigned for the 15 kV voltage class is shown in Fig. 27.\nThe modules (Folding bridge +HSCSRC) were split into two\ndifferent PCBs (the MV and LV sides, as shown in Fig. 27(a)),\nenabling an adequate design regarding the differential and\ncommon mode insulation requirements. The voltage trans-\nformer can be seen as well, and it is used to measure the\nMV input voltage of 13.8 kV to accomplish the synchronous\noperation of the Folding/Unfolding bridges with the MV grid.\nThe control boards are shown, in which all the gate signals of\nthe switches are sent to the modules through ﬁber-optic links.\nThe MFT transformer designed for the 15 kV voltage class\ncan be seen in Fig. 27(b). It is observed that the core-type\ntransformer is used, wherein the windings are assembled\nusing the slotted-bobbin method and epoxy resin is used to\ncover the necessary insulation along with the proper design of\nthe coil former with polyamide material. Additional elements\nmust be used in the coil former for improving the insulation\nrequirements, enabling the proper design of the creepage and\nclearance distances between the MV and LV sides.\nREFERENCES\n[1] W.
