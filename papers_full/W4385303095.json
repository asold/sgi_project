T o avoid crucial\ndamage, it is necessary to detect the winding deformation at an early stage (Deng et al., 2023).\nMany scholars all over the world devote themselves to the research of transformer\nwinding deformation fault diagnosis. Different methods have been developed and applied\nto the transformer fault diagnosis program, and achieved good results. Due to its own\nadvantages, frequency response analysis (FRA) has become the most widely accepted\ntransformer winding deformation fault method among many commercial technologies.\nFRA relies on the fact that the transformer winding is equivalent of an electrical network\nconsisting of resistance, capacitance and inductance in high frequency range, and its\nfrequency response signature can represent the status of the winding ( Portilla et al., 2014).\nFrontiers in Energy Research 01 frontiersin.org\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2023.1175808\nThe proposal of ladder network provides a good framework for\nmodeling the high frequency response of transformer windings\n(Abeywickrama et al., 2008 ). Many attempts have been made to\nmodel transformer windings through ladder circuits (Mondal et al.,\n2018). It is still the mainstream to determine the value of circuit\nparameters (denoted by R, L, M and C) by using the finite element\nmethod (FEM) (Abeywickrama et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2014). This\nmethod is adopted in this paper.\nIn recent years, the concept of Digital Twin (DT) technology\nhas developed vigorously and gradually spread to various fields.\nDT technology was proposed by Professor Michael grieves of\nSchengen University in 2003. It was initially defined as “virtual\ndigital expression equivalent to physical model” ( Grieves, 2015). In\nthe electrical power industry, people hope to use DT technology to\npromote the digitization and intelligence of electrical equipment.\nAt present, the relevant research is in the preliminary development\nstage. Reference ( Zhou et al., 2020 ) propose to build a model of\ndefect text mining and transformer asset status evaluation based on\nLong Short-T erm Memory (LSTM), which provides a basis for the\nestablishment of DT system. The DT is constructed to realize the\nreal-time monitoring of the medium voltage winding of distribution\ntransformer in (Moutis and Alizadeh-Mousavi, 2021). An approach\nestablishes a DT model of power transformer and acquires the\nsample data and labels from the simulation process and state\nevaluation under various condition is also developed ( Y ang et al.,\n2019). These sample data and labels will guide the decision making\nof state evaluation in the real situation. These forward-looking work\nhave made great contributions to the development of DT technology\nof transformer, which have great referential significances. For the\ntopic of transformer winding deformation, it is impractical to stage\nvarious fault types with different levels on operating transformers\nto examine their effects on the FRA signature ( Abu-Siada et al.,\n2020). And it is costly to carry out destructive experiments on\nan actual transformer. As a result, transformer winding failure\ncases has always been hard to obtain. Further, the lack of fault\ndata samples leads to the intellectualization of transformer fault\ndiagnosis is blocked and remain stagnant. However, with the help\nof DT technology, this problem will no longer be a problem. In\na virtual space, any destructive simulation can be carried out at\nalmost zero cost. This paper will also try to introduce the DT\ntechnology into the winding deformation diagnosis, establish the\nDT model of transformer, and obtain more data for analysis through\nthe simulation experiment of DT .\nIt is a general trend that artificial intelligence is introduced\ninto transformer fault diagnosis. As a popular way to realize\nartificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) has been widely\nrecognized in many application areas. Neural network, one of many\nmachine learning algorithms, is a highly complex nonlinear system\nwith strong classification ability, which can solve very complex\nclassification problems. It is naturally used to realize the diagnosis of\ntransformer windings. In the previous work of transformer winding\nfault diagnosis, due to the lack of fault cases, only some neural\nnetwork classifiers suitable for small sample classification can be\nused, of which the most typical case in point is support vector\nmachine (SVM). SVM is a small sample learning method with solid\ntheoretical foundation. It has been partially successfully applied in\ntransformer fault diagnosis. However, with the introduction of DT\ntechnology, the problem of data has been solved, and then other\nneural networks can also shine on this topic. Over the past few\nyears, deep neural network (DNN) has indeed proved its ability, and\nbeen a real hit in the academic community. Recently, Google’ s work\nhas brought multi-layer perceptron (MLP) back to people’ s vision\n(T olstikhin et al., 2021). MLP is not a new concept, and MLP’ s return\nto the spotlight just proves its strength. This paper also attempts to\nuse MLP to locate winding deformation fault, and compares it with\nsome other tools.\nIn the existing literature on transformer fault diagnosis, most of\nthem focus on the task of fault classification. Due to the difficulty\nof fault location task, only a few scientific researchers make efforts\nto overcome this problem. V S B Chaitanya Duvvury presents an\ninnovative FRA measurement technique to identify the faulty phase\n(whether the middle or either of the two outer phases) in ‘delta-\nconnected’ HV windings (Duvvury and Pramanik, 2021). However,\nthis paper can only identify the fault phase, the more specific location\nrange of the fault cannot be further spot. In ( Ma et al., 2021 ), a\ntest optical fiber is mounted on the outside surface of the power\ntransformer windings to achieve the purpose of fault location. The\noperation of the proposed method is complex, and it is basically\nimpossible to realize for a large number of transformers that have\nbeen put into operation. And such an avant-garde approach has a\nlong way to go before it is widely accepted by the traditional electrical\nappliance manufacturing industry. Therefore, to avoid such complex\noperation, this work will realize fault location in a data-driven way.\nIn view of the above background, the work flow of this study is\nas follows. The design parameters of a transformer are used for 3D\nmodeling, and the distributed parameters of windings are obtained\nthrough the calculation of FEM. On this basis, the ladder network\nof transformer winding is constructed. Through the circuit analysis\nof the ladder network, the FRA signature of the transformer can\nbe obtained. It is worth mentioning that the ladder network is\nessentially the DT of the transformer winding. Failure cases can\nbe collected by fault simulation of DT s. After that, some artificial\nintelligence methods are introduced and compared. By using the\ndata to train the neural network, the winding fault location model\nis constructed to realize the fault location. The proposal proposed in\nthis paper is finally verified on an actual transformer. The relevant\nwork was disclosed in ICHVE-2022 (Liu et al., 2022), but due to the\nlength limit of the conference paper, the technical details were not\npresented. Additionally, this paper provides a detailed mathematical\nderivation to prove that the phase spectrum does not provide more\ninformation about the winding condition.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2 describes\nthe construction of DT and fault simulation settings. The theoretical\nsupport of un-tenability of phase-based FRA interpretation and the\nwhole process of fault location model establishment are illustrated in\nSection 3. Section 4 is the case verification of the proposed method.\nSection 5 concludes the outcome of this work.\n2 Construction of DT and fault\nsimulation\n2.1 Construction of DT\nRef ( Wu et al., 2021 ) mentioned that, according to the data\ninteraction mode between DT s and physical entities, the current\nFrontiers in Energy Research 02 frontiersin.org\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2023.1175808\nTABLE 1 Detailed design parameters of transformer.\nHV winding parameters LV winding parameters\nHeight/mm 775 Height/mm 785\nNumber of disks 20 Number of disks 11\nT urns per disks 24 T urns per disks 4\nOuter diameter of disk/mm 1,213 Outer diameter of disk/mm 833\nInner diameter of disk/mm 1,055 Inner diameter of disk/mm 720\nCore parameters\n Core model B30P120\n Distance between core legs/mm 1,385\n Distance between yokes/mm 1,000\n Equivalent diameter of core legs/mm 690\nFIGURE 1\n3D view of the constructed transformer model.\ndefinition of DT can be divided into three levels. The primary DT\nmainly emphasizes the mirror model of a physical object. And there\nis no automatic data exchange between the physical. At present, it\nis in the early stage of the development of DT technology related to\ntransformer winding, so this work only takes the construction of the\nprimary level of DT as a challenge.\nThe idea of the proposed methodology is based on\ncharacterizing transformer winding with ladder network. Based\non the design parameters of an actual transformer, the modeling\ncan be carried out. See Table 1 for detailed design parameters of\ntransformer object. The constructed model is shown in Figure 1.\nMany literature have reported the calculation of winding\ndistributed parameters by FEM ( Hashemnia et al., 2015a ;\nHashemnia et al., 2015b), which will not be described too much in\nTABLE 2 Distributed parameter value of winding.\nHV winding disk LV winding disk\nRsH /mΩ 2.04 RsL/μΩ 185\nLsH /mH 1.168 LsL/μH 23.293\nCgH /nF 1.630 CgL/nF 1.800\nGgH /S 1/7 M GgL/S 1/7 M\nCsH /nF 1.183 CsL/nF 1.190\nGsH /S 1/7 M GsL/S 1/7 M\nMs/μH 877.196 Ms/μH 15.210\nCHL/pF 252.5\nGHL/S 1/7 M\nMHL/μH 96.434\nthis paper. By solving Maxwell equations and using energy balance\nmethod, the distributed parameters of the winding in healthy\ncondition can be calculated. The numerical solution can be seen\nin Table 2.\nThe specific physical meaning of parameters in Table 2 is\nexplained as follows. RsH and LsH represent the resistance and the\nself-inductance of each HV winding disk respectively. Obviously,\nRsL and LsL represent the corresponding physical quantity of\neach LV winding disk respectively. CHL and GHL mean the\ncapacitance and conductance between the HV winding disk and\nthe corresponding LV winding disk. CgH , CgL, GgH , GgL are\nthe capacitance and conductance to the ground of HV winding\ndisks and LV winding disks respectively. CsH , GsH , CsL, GsL\non behalf of the capacitance and conductance between adjacent\ndisks in HV winding and LV winding. MS and MHL represent\nmutual inductance within and between HV and LV windings\nrespectively.\nAfter obtaining the distributed parameters, the ladder network\ncan be built successfully. The equivalent double-ladder network\nis presented in Figure 2. So far, the construction of transformer\nwinding DT is completed.\n2.2 Fault simulation\nDisk space variation (DSV) is one of the most common\ndeformation faults of transformer windings. It is of great significance\nto successfully locate DSV fault. As the FRA traces of transformer\nwinding has different characteristics under different types of faults,\nin order to eliminate the influence of fault types on fault location,\nthis study pay all attention to DSV fault location. For the DSV\nfault concerned in this paper, it has been pointed out that the DSV\nfault has been revealed that the capacitance parameter dominates\nthe effect and this fault could be emulated by changing the inter-\ndisk capacitance parameter ( Abu-Siada et al., 2013). Therefore, this\nstudy achieves the purpose of DSV fault simulation by paralleling\ncapacitors with different capacitance values at different positions, so\nas to obtain a large number of frequency response data under fault\nconditions.\nFrontiers in Energy Research 03 frontiersin.org\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2023.1175808\nFIGURE 2\nThe constructed equivalent double-ladder network and shunt capacitance representing DSV Fault.\nAs seen in Table 1, the high voltage winding is composed of 20\ndisks. When simulating DSV fault, 19 different fault positions can be\nsimulated by paralleling capacitance between two adjacent winding\ndisks. In order to obtain sufficient fault cases, the shunt capacitance\nof each fault location sweeps from 50pF to 1 nF (the sweep step is\n50 nF), so as to achieve the effect of simulating different degrees of\nfaults. Figure 2 shows the shunt capacitance representing DSV fault;\nFigure 3 gives the FRA curves at different fault positions under the\nsame fault degree (The capacitance value of shunt capacitors are both\n1 nF).\n3 MLP-based fault location model\n3.1 Proof of the phase/amplitude part’s\ndependency\nThere are two main directions for the FRA interpretation code.\nOne is based on the mathematical statistical indicators of frequency\nresponse data. Many studies have adopted this method and reported\ngood results. The other is to start with the image information of FRA\nsignature, combined with digital image processing (DIP) technology\nto extract image features, finally realize the interpretation of FRA.\nResearchers following the latter method hold the views that, the\nmost of the current work only focuses on the amplitude information\nof frequency response, and introducing the phase information of\nfrequency response can provide more mechanical state information\nof the winding. Based on this opinion, some related work is derived.\nIn fact, the above two interpretation methods have been used\nin previous contributions ( Liu et al., 2019 ; Liu et al., 2020 ). The\naccuracy of fault type classification achieved by using traditional\nmathematical statistical indicators (96.3%) ( Liu et al., 2019 ) is\nalmost the same as that by using FRA signature texture features\n(97.8%) (Liu et al., 2020). It turns out like the introduction of phase\ninformation cannot provide more information. The explanation\ncombined with the linear system theory will be given below to\nFIGURE 3\nFRA curves at different fault positions.\nprove that the introduction of phase information is not of additional\nhelp.\nIn the frequency range of more than 1kHz, the influence of core\ncan be ignored. FRA regards the transformer winding as a linear\nsystem composed of RLC. It should be highlighted that linear system\nis the foundation of FRA theory. In the theories of linear systems,\ncausality is defined as follows:\nFor any input signal, if the output signal value of the system at\nany time only depends on the input signal value at that time and\nbefore that time, and has nothing to do with the input signal value\nat the future time, the system has causality.\nCausality can be explained by the following mathematical\nexpression:\ny(t) = f{x(t − τ), τ ≥ 0} (1)\nFrontiers in Energy Research 04 frontiersin.org\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2023.1175808\nwhere y(t) is the output of system, and x(t) represents the system\ninput. Eq. 1 means that the output of the system is determined by\nand only by the current and previous inputs.\nAs transformer winding is a physical real system, the system\nmust meet the definition of causality. Therefore, from the perspective\nof FRA, the transformer winding is a causal linear system.\nFurthermore, in linear system theory, it can be proved that the real\nand imaginary parts of the causal linear systems frequency response\nsatisfy Hilbert transform.\nLet f (t) be the impulse response of the system, then its Fourier\ntransform is the frequency response of the system. Its Fourier\ntransform is expressed as real part R (ω) and imaginary part I (ω):\nf(t)\nFFT\n→ F(ω) = R(ω) + jI(ω) (2)\nBecause of the causality of the system, f (t) satisfies:\nf(t) = f(t)u(t) (3)\nWhere u(t) is the step signal.\nu(t) =\n{\n{\n{\n0, t < 0\n1, t ≥ 0\n(4)\nTaking Fourier transform on both sides of Eq. 3, we can get:\nR(ω) + jI(ω) = 1\n2π [R(ω) + jI(ω)] ⋆ [πδ(ω) + 1\njω ]\n= [ R(ω)\n2 + 1\n2π I(ω) ⋆ 1\nω ] + j[ I(ω)\n2 − 1\n2π R(ω) ⋆ 1\nω ] (5)\nThe real and imaginary parts on both sides of Eq.  5 are equal\nrespectively. It should be noted that the \"*\" in the equation represents\na convolution operation, which denotes the integral of the product\nof the overlapping portions of two functions after one of them has\nbeen flipped and shifted with respect to the other, over the range of\noverlap.\nR(ω) = 1\nπ I(ω) ⋆ 1\nω = 1\nπ ∫\n∞\n−∞\nI(δ)\nω − δ dδ (6)\nI(ω) = − 1\nπ R(ω) ⋆ 1\nω = − 1\nπ ∫\n∞\n−∞\nR(δ)\nω − δ dδ (7)\nIn a word, the real part and imaginary part of the frequency\nresponse of the transformer winding are not independent of each\nother. Naturally, it means that the amplitude spectrum and phase\nspectrum of frequency response are not independent of each other\neither. The phase spectrum can be calculated from the amplitude\nspectrum, and the converse is equally true, the amplitude spectrum\ncan be expressed from the phase spectrum.\nIn summary, the phase information is not of additional help.\nTherefore, this paper extracts the mathematical statistical indicators\nof frequency response data to characterize the samples. Figure 4\nshows the flow chart of this work.\n3.2 Dataset composition\nThe mathematical statistical indicators have the advantages of\nsimple and fast calculation, and the calculation result is not sensitive\nto noise. This paper selects 8 indicators, which are listed in Table 3.\nFIGURE 4\nFlow chart of this work.\nTABLE 3 Indicators used in this paper.\nDefinition Formula\nCorrelation Coefficient\nn\n∑\ni=1\nXiYi\n√\nn\n∑\ni=1\nXi2\nn\n∑\ni=1\nYi2\nEuclidean Distance √\nn\n∑\ni=1\n(Yi − Xi)2\nMaximum of difference max(Yi − Xi)\nSum Squared Error 1\nn\nn\n∑\ni=1\n(Yi − Xi)2\nSum Squared Ratio Error 1\nn\nn\n∑\ni=1\n( Yi\nXi\n− 1)\n2\nIntegral of Absolute difference ∫ |Y( f) − X( f)|d f\nSum Squared Max-Min Ratio Error 1\nn\nn\n∑\ni=1\n(\nmax(Yi,Xi)\nmin(Yi,Xi) − 1)\n2\nRoot Mean Square Error √ 1\nn\nn\n∑\ni=1\n(\n|Yi|−|Xi|\n1\nn\nn\n∑\ni=1\n|Xi|\n)\n2\nAs mentioned above, this paper expects to be able to locate the\nfault location, so the fault location is set as three categories, namely,\ntop, middle and bottom. The 120 samples with the fault located\nranging from the first to seventh winding disc are labelled as ‘T op’ .\nAnd flag the 120 samples with the fault located ranging from the 14th\nto 20th winding disc as ‘Bottom’ . The remain 140 samples marked as\n‘Middle’ . After labeling each sample, the dataset is formed.\n3.3 MLP training and testing\nThe re-popularity of MLP is closely related to the development\nof computing resources. Previous work has tried to add a priori\nknowledge to the network topology to reduce the resources required\nfor parameter optimization ( T olstikhin et al., 2021). Thanks to the\nupgrading of hardware, the current trend is to let this part of\nFrontiers in Energy Research 05 frontiersin.org\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2023.1175808\nFIGURE 5\nTypical structure diagram of MLP .\nTABLE 4 Average performance of MLP model in 10 repeated experiments.\nValidation\naccuracy (%)\nTraining\naccuracy (%)\nTesting\naccuracy (%)\n93.257 98.8 96.333\npriori knowledge can be learned through a large amount of data.\nFigure 5 depicts a typical structure of the MLP . It can be seen from\nFigure 5 that the full-connected structure makes MLP have far more\nparameters to be adjusted through learning compared with other\nneural networks This also means that the potential mapping ability\nof MLP is stronger than other neural networks. Recent studies\n(T olstikhin et al., 2021) have shown the potential ability of MLP .\nA three-layer MLP was involved in this study. After receiving\nthe input, the input layer is connected to the hidden layer, and\nthe hidden layer outputs to a softmax classifier to classify the fault\nlocation. The input layer is composed of 8 neurons, while the hidden\nlayer is composed of 133 neurons. It is a common sense in the field\nof neural network that, the width of neural network determines its\nability of feature extraction, while the depth determines its ability\nof nonlinear mapping. Such a wide network structure enables the\nmodel to extract rich information from the input for fault location.\nThe nonlinear mapping between FRA features and fault location may\nnot require a very deep neural network structure. So the hidden\nlayer structure of MLP constructed in this study prefers width rather\nthan depth. The activation function is set to Rectified Linear Unit\n(Relu), which not only enhances the nonlinear expression ability\nof the network, but also speeds up the training of the network and\nprevents the gradient from disappearing. The number of iterations\nis set to 2,500.\nIn order to evaluate the performance of the model more\nobjectively, the dataset is divided into two parts: training set and\ntesting set. 30 samples are randomly selected from the dataset as the\nFIGURE 6\nThe confusion matrix on testing set.\nTABLE 5 Average performance of SVM model in 10 repeated experiments.\nValidation\naccuracy (%)\nTraining\naccuracy (%)\nTesting\naccuracy (%)\n87.143 90.857 85.667\nFIGURE 7\nThe confusion matrix of SVM.\nFrontiers in Energy Research 06 frontiersin.org\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2023.1175808\nFIGURE 8\nThe actual photographic of transformer and the DSV fault simulation real-taken image.\nFIGURE 9\nSome FRA curves of the transformer under DSV fault.\ntesting set, and then the rest constitute the training set. In addition,\nin order to reduce the generalization error, the k-fold cross validation\nmethod is also introduced. The value of k is 10, so the size of the\nvalidation set is one-10th of the training set.\nAs mentioned earlier, the training and testing sets are randomly\nselected from the dataset. Due to the randomness in the division\nprocess of training set and test set, 10 repeated experiments were\ncarried out in this paper to rule out chance as the cause.Table 4offers\nthe performance of the model in training set, verification set and\ntesting set.\nFrom the above results, it can be seen that the model has been\nwell trained and really learned the mapping relationship between\nfault location and FRA features. Figure 6 is the confusion matrix\nobtained by testing the trained MLP model with the testing set. In\nFigure 6, labels 1, 2 and 3 represents the top, middle and bottom\nrespectively. The labels at the bottom of Figure 6 are the actual\nlabels of the winding fault, which are the targets of the model. The\nleft labels in Figure 6 are the labels output by the model. Taking\nthe output and target of the model as the index, the classified\nnumber of corresponding samples and their percentage to the total\nnumber of samples is also displayed in the box. If the classification\nresult is correct, the box is displayed in green; if incorrect, the\nbox is displayed in red. The correct classification rate and error\nclassification rate of corresponding classes are calculated in the Silver\nFrontiers in Energy Research 07 frontiersin.org\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2023.1175808\nFIGURE 10\nThe confusion matrix of MLP fault location model on the testing set.\nbox. The final statistical results of the correct classification rate and\nthe error classification rate of all samples are shown in the gray box.\nFrom the confusion matrix, the model can achieve very good results\nin the testing set. Only a few samples cannot be accurately located,\nwhich proves the generalization ability of the MLP model.\nFor a specific fault class X, the expressions of recall and precision\nare shown in Eqss 8, 9 (Li, Hou, and Sheng, 2020):\nλrecall = NTP\nNTP + NFN\n× 100% (8)\nλprecision = NTP\nNTP + NFP\n× 100% (9)\nWhere λrecall is recall and λprecision is precision. NTP is the number\nof true positive cases, that is, the number of samples with predicted\nclass X and actual class X. NFN is the number of false negative cases\n(NTP + NFN ) refers to the total number of samples with actual class\nX. NFP is the number of false positive cases (NTP + NFP) refers to the\ntotal number of samples with predicted class X.\nThe recall and precision of the model for each category are listed\non the bottom and right of the confusion matrix in Figure 6. It can\nbe seen that no matter where the fault occurs, the model can locate\nit with an accuracy of more than 95.9%. For the output results of the\nmodel, the judgment of the model can be agreed with the reliability\nof 95.3% at least.\n3.4 Comparison and discussion\nIn the field of transformer fault diagnosis, SVM remains a hot\ntopic. Its principle is introduced in many papers, which will not be\nexpanded in this paper. In this paper, the same repeated randomized\ntrial is also used to train SVM to compare with the MLP in this\npaper. The confusion matrix of SVM and average performance in 10\nrepeated experiments is provided inTable 5and Figure 7. The results\nshow that SVM is far inferior to MLP .\nThe essence of MLP and SVM is to map the problem to high-\ndimensional space, and then complete the classification task in high-\ndimensional space. In principle, the effect of classification is directly\naffected by the mapping method. If the patterns show obvious\ndifferences in high-dimensional space, good classification results\ncan be achieved. On the contrary, the effect will be poor. In this\nsense, the result of MLP must be better than SVM. Because MLP\nis finding effective mapping mode in an active way, while SVM\nare in a passive way. For SVM, once the kernel function is fixed,\nthe mapping method is uniquely determined, unless the kernel\nfunction is changed. Therefore, it is a hit-and-miss affair whether the\nchosen kernel function is suitable, so the performance is worse than\nMLP .\n4 Case verification\nIn order to verify whether the MLP-based fault location model\nproposed in this paper is competent for DSV fault location of\nactual transformer, DSV fault simulation is carried out on an\nactual transformer. And the effectiveness of the proposed method\nis verified by the obtained frequency response data.\nThe simulation of DSV fault is also completed by paralleling\na certain capacitance between two adjacent disks. All experiments\nwere carried out using FRA end-to-end open circuit connection.\nRefer to Figure 8 for the actual photographic of transformer and the\nDSV fault simulation real-taken image. More detailed descriptions\nof this transformer can be found in ( Zhao et al., 2018).\nThree fault locations are fully considered and simulated with\nthe fault degree represented by the capacitance of 50pF , 67pF ,\n100pF , 200pF , 400pF , 600pF , 800 pF . The frequency response dataset\nobtained under DSV fault consists of 42 cases, and some of them are\nput in Figure 9.\nThe method proposed in this paper is applied to the frequency\nresponse data set of actual transformer. Similarly, the data set is\ndivided into training set and test set, 30 samples are included in the\ntraining set, and the remaining 12 samples form the test set. After\n10 repeated random experiments, the confusion matrix of MLP\nfault location model on the testing set is finally got and placed in\nFigure 10.\nAs shown in Figure 10, it can be seen that the MLP-based DSV\nfault location model can work out well on the actual transformer,\nand the results are satisfactory. It can be noted from Figure 10\nthat the number of misjudged samples above the diagonal of the\nconfusion matrix is much more than that below the diagonal of\nthe confusion matrix. This phenomenon illustrates that the trained\nMLP model tends to locate the fault closer to the top area. Through\ncomprehensive observation of Figure 6 and Figure 10, it is found\nthat class 3 has the lowest recall and the highest precision. This also\nproves the above speculation about the judgment tendency of the\nmodel.\nFrontiers in Energy Research 08 frontiersin.org\nLiu et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2023.1175808\n5 Conclusion\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows.\n1) DT of transformer winding is constructed based on double\nladder network. Through the fault simulation of DT , the fault\nsamples are obtained, which solves the dilemma of insufficient\nfault data to a certain extent.\n2) This paper proves that the phase information of transformer\nfrequency response does not provide additional winding\ndeformation information.\n3) The mathematical indexes of the frequency response data are\nextracted, and the MLP model is trained to locate the DSV fault\nThe superiority of MLP is demonstrated by comparison with\nSVM.\n4) The proposed method has been verified on an actual transformer,\nand its excellent performance tells the potential of MLP in fault\nlocation.\nFuture work can focus on modeling DT more accurately. More\nfrequency response data can be obtained through DT to strive for\nfurther spot the fault location. Moreover, the diagnosis of fault\ndegree can also be studied and discussed.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in\nthe article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed\nto the corresponding author.\nAuthor contributions\nJL: designed and wrote this manuscript.
