Several populations of wild\nchimpanzees use tools to raid bee nests, but preliminary observations of chimpanzees in\nthe Congo Basin indicate that these apes may have developed sophisticated technical\nsolutions to gather honey that differ from those of apes in other regions. Differences in\ntool using strategies may reflect responses to different bee taxa, functional tactics for\ncoping with target beehives, or socially transmitted traditions that differ between groups\nof chimpanzees (McGrew1992). We attempt to precisely identify differences in tool-\nusing strategies among populations by compiling reports from across the species\nrange. This provides an informative context for presenting the first full descriptions of\ntool-using behaviors in honey-gathering by a population of the central subspecies of\nchimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes).\nChimpanzees typically gather the honey of African honey (Apini) and\nstingless (Meliponini) bee species that is stored in wax or resin vessels within\nthe nest, but they also dip for the honey of carpenter bees ( Xylocopa sp.) at\nsome sites in West Africa (TableI). Nests ofApis may contain several kilograms of\nhoney, whereas stingless bees rarely store >1 kg (Roubik 1989). Bees have\ndeveloped effective means of protecting their hives that most often involve the\nfortification and concealment of their nests. Different bee species show particular\nnesting habits, but there is also variation in nest building within species (Roubik\n1989). Bee nests of Apidae are most often builtin tree hollows or other preexisting\ncavities (Roubik 1989). Other bees may find lodging underground, in the forest\ncanopy, or within the nests of other insects such as ants or termites. Certain bees\nalso restrict or close the nest entrancewhen an intruder is detected. Another form\nof nest defense is to pursue or sting the intruder.Apis and Meliponini both have\nalarm pheromones that mark the hive raider so as to direct their conspecifics to the\nthreat. The task of the honey-gathering chimpanzee is to overcome the defensive\nstrategies of the bees themselves, breach the protective structure of the hive, and\nextract the honey and larvae.\nPrevious reports of chimpanzee tool use in honey-gathering describe several\ndifferent tools and associated behaviors (TableII), which together are referred to\nhere as tool strategies. Inserting a probe into a beehive to extract honey (dipping) is\nthe most widespread tactic used by chimpanzees in honey-gathering (Ivory Coast:\nBoesch and Boesch1990; Guinea: Ohashi2006; Central African Republic: Fay and\nCarroll 1994; Gabon: Boeschet al. in press; Tutinet al. 1995; Republic of Congo:\nBermejo and Illera1999; Sanz and Morgan2007; Tanzania: Izawa and Itani1966;\nUganda: Nishida and Hiraiwa1982, Stanford et al. 2000, Watts 2008, Wrangham\nand Muller,pers. comm.). Chimpanzees may also manually detach an entire hive\nor a branch segment that contains a bee nest, and then use a dipping tool to\nextract the honey (Ohashi 2006).

The function of this tool is to weaken or break the area near\nthe entrance of the hive to provide a larger access point. The pounding action\noften causes the end of the club to become blunt and smooth.\nBai Hokou, C.A.R. (Fay and Carroll1994); Ndakan, C.A.R. (Fay and Carroll1994); Ngotto\nF o r e s t ,C . A .

(Bermejo and Illera1999)Honey pound\nHoney hammer\nFluid dip Chimpanzee inserts twig or stick into entrance of hive. The stick is extracted and\nhoney is transferred to the mouth. The function of this tool is to collect honey from\nthe hive. Some populations have been reported to use frayed dip sticks, but dip\nsticks may also become frayed as a byproduct of repeated dipping into the hive.\nTaï, Ivory Coast (Boesch and Boesch1990); Bossou, Guinea (Ohashi2006); Bai\nHokou, C.A.R.

Chimpanzee holds one end of a twig or stick tool and pushes the\nother end either into the hive entrance or on the area near the hive entrance. This\naction may be repeated several times, and the chimpanzee may visually examine\nor smell the end of the tool between probing. Tool function seems to be\ndetermining the presence of bees, verifying access into the hive, or testing the\nstructural integrity of the nest.\nTaï, Ivory Coast (Boesch and Boesch1990); Gashaka, Nigeria: (Fowler and\nSommer 2007); Kanyawara, Uganda: (Wrangham and Muller pers comm.)Investigatory probe\nb\nLever-open Chimpanzee inserts stick tool into hive entrance and then moves the tool\nvigorously within the nest. Insertion of the tool into the nest and pressing\nagainst the sides of the hive structure may provide leverage to widen access to\nthe inner chambers of the hive or break the inner structures of the hive. The\nsides or ends of the tool may show wear from friction with the hive entrance or\ninner nest chambers.\nLoango, Gabon (Boeschet al. in press); Ngotto Forest, C.A.R.

Morgan\nTable III (continued)\nBehavior Definition in honey gathering context Localities of known observations\nFlail/club Chimpanzee hits side of stick or club against hive entrance. Sides of tool show\nwear. Rather than focusing specifically on the hive entrance, these forceful\nblows with the side of the club may serve to weaken the structure of the area\naround the hive as well as the hive entrance.\nGoualougo, R.O.C. (this study)\nPress and hold Chimpanzee holds midsection of tool and places end of tool at the hive entrance,\nand pushes for several seconds. In addition to possibly weakening the hive\nstructure, pressing and holding for several seconds may also provide\ninformation about the structural integrity of the hive.\nGoualougo, R.O.C. (this study)\nRotate/twist Chimpanzee places end of tool at hive entrance and then rotates tool as if drilling into\nthe nest. Tool stays in contact with nest while rotated. The function of this tool is to\nprovide a larger access point into the hive.\nGoualougo, R.O.C. (this study)\nWhisk/swat Chimpanzee uses leaves or leafy twig to dispel insects that mob the hive attacker.\nThe tool is vigorously whisked or swatted at insects near the entrance of the\nhive or around the body of the tool user.\nGoualougo, R.O.C. (Sanz and Morgan2007); Gombe, Tanzania (Goodall1986);\nNgogo, Uganda (Watts2008)Brush\nDig/pry Chimpanzee uses a stick tool to access a subterranean beehive. Tools are used to\npry soil from entrance or dig into earth. The function of the tool may be to\nlocate the exact location of the underground hive, provide an access point to\nthe hive, or perforate the hive structure itself to access to honey.\nLa Belgique, Cameroon (Deblauwe2006); Loango, Gabon (Boeschet al. in\npress); Ngotto Forest, C.A.R.

The authors have grouped terms from the literature thatare likely to represent the\nsame behavior.\na Boesch et al.(in press) determined the function of tools recovered at tool sites based on the size, thickness, and types of wear on the tool. C. Boeschet al.(pers. comm.) related\nthe tool types they have recovered (pounder, collector, enlarger, perforator, swabber) in Loango, Gabon to the definitions of tool using behaviors defined in this table.\nb Beehive probing is likely to be identified at most sites as investigatory probing that is not limited to the honey-gathering context. Goodall (1968) defined investigatory probe as“probe\nuse to examine location (usually hole/recess), then sniffed.” Investigatory probe is considered a universal behavior across long-term chimpanzee study sites (Whitenet al.2001).\nChimpanzee Tool Strategies in Honey-gathering 417\nCameroon, Central African Republic, and Tanzania, it is less common for\nc h i m p a n z e e st ou s eat o o lt od i go rp r yo p e ns u b t e r r a n e a nh i v e s( D e b l a u w e\n2006; Fay and Carroll1994;F o w l e ra n dS o m m e r2007; Goodall1986;H i c k set al.\n2005). Researchers have observed chimpanzees using a tool as a lever to widen the\naccess point to extract honey in Tanzania, Central African Republic, Gabon, and\nRepublic of Congo (Bermejo and Illera1999; Fay and Carroll1994;H i c k set al.\n2005; Sanz and Morgan 2007; Tutin et al. 1995; Wallauer, pers. comm .).\nResearchers have rarely observed pounding or hammering of beehives with the\nend of a large club to break the hive, but it seems exclusive to chimpanzee\npopulations of the Congo Basin (Central African Republic: Fay and Carroll1994,\nHicks et al. 2005; Republic of Congo: Bermejo and Illera1999;S a n za n dM o r g a n\n2007). Based on the geographical distribution of particular behaviors (Fig. 1),\nHicks et al.( 2005) hypothesized that there are regional honey-gathering traditions\namong wild chimpanzees. However, it is important to define tool-using behaviors\nmore precisely so that observers can accurately identify similarities and differences\nbetween sites (TableIII).\nAlthough there are several published reports spanning >50 yr, the available\ninformation on the honey-gathering by wild chimpanzees in central Africa has\nbeen limited to recovered tool assemblages or fleeting observations of\nunhabituated apes. We examined if previous suggestions of regional tool using\ntraditions in honey-gathering are supported by direct observations of chimpan-\nzees in central Africa. We analyzed vide o recordings of honey-gathering to\ndefine tool behaviors more precisely in this context and examine the plausibility\nof regional patterns of tool use. We also summarize information on the\ntaxonomic composition of bee species to i nvestigate if characteristics of the\ntarget hives may be shaping the honey-gathering strategies of wild chimpanzees\nacross sites.\nLopé\nTa1\nBossou\nGoualougo\nLossi\nNdakanDja\nMahale-K\nKasakati\nBwindi\nGashaka\nAssirik\nKanyawara\nNgotto\nBai Hokou\nKahuzi Biega\nHive Pound\nLever\nHoney Dip\nDig/Pry\nProbe\nBee Kill\nWhisk/Swat\nSwab\nLoango\nGombe\nNgogo\n˙˙\nFig. 1 Location of sites where chimpanzees use tools to gather honey. Symbols indicate the types of tool\nuse at each site.\n418 C.M. Sanz, D.B. Morgan\nMethods\nStudy Site\nThe Goualougo Triangle is located in the southern portion of the Nouabalé-Ndoki\nNational Park, Republic of Congo. The study area covers 380 km\n2 of evergreen and\nsemideciduous lowland forest, with altitudes ranging between 330 and 600 m. The\nclimate is transitional between the Congo-equatorial and subequatorial climatic\nzones. Rainfall is bimodal, with a main rainy season from August through November\nand a short rainy season in May.\nStudy Population\nBetween February 1999 and December 2006, we spent 88 mo in the Goualougo Triangle\nhabituating and studying wild chimpanzees. We conducted reconnaissance surveys in\nseveral community ranges, but the majority of this time was concentrated on the\nsemihabituated Moto community, which consists of 70 individuals, including immatures.\nData Collection\nWe documented chimpanzee tool-using behaviors via direct observation. For all\ninstances of tool using behavior, we recorded the actor, type of object used, target of\nobject, actions, context or goal of the tool-using behavior, and the outcome, which\nwe used to define tool function. We recorded digital video of tool-using behaviors,\nduration of honey-gathering episodes, other chimpanzees present, and collected tools\nwhenever possible. We recorded the location of each tool site, species of targeted\nbeehive, materials used to make the tool, length, diameter, and any modifications to\nthe raw materials. Tool measurements are reported in Sanz and Morgan (2007).\nWe also collected information about the height, size of the hive entrance, and other\nphysical defenses of the target beehive. We adopted Roubik’s( 1989)c l a s s i f i c a t i o no f\nbee nesting biology, which includes digger bees, lodger bees, and mason bees. Digger\nbees excavate nests in the ground or other substrate. Lodger bees modify preexisting\ncavities. Mason bees construct nests that are not enclosed in a substrate.\nVideo Data Analysis\nWe archived data from digital video cassettes on external hard drive devices and converted\nthem to MPEG files for review. We conducted video analysis using INTERACT Version\n8.04 (Mangold2006). We scored video recordings astool-using episodes and bouts\n(Yamakoshi and Myowa-Yamakoshi2004). An episode begins when the chimpanzee\nmanufactures a tool or the first moment after which they are observed with the tool and\nends when the tool is discarded or the task is abandoned. A bout begins when a\nchimpanzee uses a tool toward achieving a goal and ends when he/she attains the goal,\nbegins using another tool, discards the tool, or pauses use of the tool for >5 s.\nUsing an ethogram of tool behaviors compiled from reports of honey-gathering at\nother sites (TableII), we scored tool using actions within video recorded episodes of\nhoney-gathering. If we did not find an observed behavior on the list of existing\nChimpanzee Tool Strategies in Honey-gathering 419\ndefinitions, then we operationally defined the novel behavior. We calculated Cohen’s\nκ to assess point-by-point agreement for tool actions (pound, dip, lever-open, push\nwith foot, flail/club, press and hold, rotate/twist, whisk/swat) between Sanz and an\nundergraduate student assistant. We scored tool actions as events, and the interval\nwidth for accuracy was 5 frames. Interobserver reliability between 2 coders wasκ=\n0.84 (n=23 episodes), which is considered excellent (Fleiss1981).\nElements are defined as functionally distinct behavioral units (Byrne and Byrne\n1993; Byrne et al. 2001). To illustrate examples of multiple tool use, we graphed\nsequences of behavioral elements (including tool actions) as they occurred in honey-\ngathering episodes. Sanz and Morgan (in press) define the essential elements and\nstructures of several tool-using behaviors observed in the Goualougo Triangle\nchimpanzee population.\nResults\nBetween 2002 and 2006, we observed 40 episodes of chimpanzees using tools to gather\nhoney. We video recorded 30 of these episodes, representing 12 different individuals and\nsubsequently analyzed them in greater detail. Chimpanzees in Goualougo most often used\ntools to open and raid arboreal Meliponini hives, but also targeted beehives located in fallen\ntrees and subterranean hives. We often located beehives in areas that were difficult to access\n(Fig.2), such as tree hollows, under the bark of living and rotting trees, and embedded in\narboreal ant nests. The most common defenses of the bees were the structure of the hive\nand mobbing of the nest invader. Attempted beehive raids took place throughout the year\nin Goualougo, with no apparent seasonal trends. There were slightly higher frequencies of\nhoney-gathering in April and from August to September, which coincides with\nenvironmental cues such as minimum temperature in the dry season which trigger\nflowering events that influence honey production by bees.\nThe average duration of honey-gathering observations was 19 min (n=26, which\ninclude the full episode), with successful episodes lasting 31 min on average and\nunsuccessful episodes <5 min on average. Chimpanzees were successful in obtaining\nhoney in half (52%) of our video-recorded observations. It was clear that they\nexpended significant effort to open the hive and attain relatively small amounts of\nhoney. The average number of tool using bouts in a successful honey-gathering\nepisode was 14±15.7 ( n= 1 4e p i s o d e s ) ,c o m p a r e dt oo n l y2 . 6 7 ± 2 . 7 4i n1 2\nunsuccessful attempts. The ratio of tool actions to goals for honey-gathering\nchimpanzees showed that an average of 6 tool actions (n=6, average=6.10±8.15,\nrange=0.23 –22.8) were required for every taste of honey. The total number of tool\nactions ranged from 1 to >1000 beehive pounding actions in a single episode.\nIn total, we observed 8 distinct types of tool actions during video recordings of\nhoney-gathering (TableIII). Beehive pounding was the most common tool tactic,\naccounting for 94% of all tool actions and shown by 11 individuals (adults/subadults=\n6, juveniles=5). Fluid dipping accounted for 2.1% of tool actions and was exhibited\nby 5 individuals (adults/subadults=3, juveniles=2). Lever-opening comprised 1.8% of\ntool actions, and was shown by 7 individuals (adults/subadults=4, juveniles=3). Five\nindividuals (adults/subadults=3, juvenile =2) exhibited a press-and-hold action, but\nthis behavior comprised only 0.3% of tool actions. Two juveniles flailed and clubbed\n420 C.M. Sanz, D.B. Morgan\nthe bee nest with the side of a branch, consisting of 0.4% of tool actions. Push with\nfoot, rotate/twist, and whisk insects were exhibited by a single juvenile, and comprised\n1.1%, 0.2%, and 0.04% of tool actions, respectively.\nMost honey-gathering episodes in Goualougo involved 1 or 2 tools, but up to 5 tools\nwere used by a single individual during a successful honey-gathering episode (Fig.2).\nAlthough limited samples sizes prevented us from making a statistical assessment,\nsuccessful tool-using episodes typically involved more tools (average=2.14,n=14)\nthan unsuccessful honey-gathering episodes (average=1.54,n=12). Subjects did not\nuse multiple tools simultaneously, but one after another in a serial fashion. We observed\nthem using the same tool repeatedly during different bouts, or alternately with other\ntools. Most of the tools had a single function, but we also observed that a single object\ncould be associated with several different tool-using functions (Fig.3). Chimpanzees\nalso frequently conserved pounding tools between bouts. Tools were placed in the\ncanopy or held (in the foot, hand, mouth, groin pocket, or neck pocket) while the\nchimpanzee inspected the hive or between bouts of tool use. In Fig.3a, we present a\ntool-using episode in which a chimpanzee first used a large pounding club that was\neventually placed on an adjacent branch while she manufactured a smaller pounding\nclub. After several bouts of pounding with the second club, she retrieved and reused her\nfirst tool. The female then subsequently manufactured a dipping probe to extract honey\nafter succeeding to open the hive. This sequence of behaviors provide evidence of\nhierarchical structuring of tool use, with the opening task preceding the extraction task.\nComparing Observations Across Sites\nThe greatest diversity of tool-using behaviors in honey-gathering has been exhibited\nby the central subspecies of chimpanzee. In addition, pounding is almost exclusively\nobserved within the Pan troglodytes troglodytes range, with the single exception\nreported from Ituri, Democratic Republic of Congo. In contrast, fluid dipping is the\nmost commonly reported tool-using behavior in honey-gathering across sites and has\nbeen observed in all chimpanzee subspecies. The other most common tool-using\nFig. 2 Images of chimpanzees using tools to pound beehives. On the right, an adult female uses a large\nclub to pound open a hive of Meliponini attached to the bark of a large tree. The left image shows a\nsubadult female pounding the rotten bark of a dead tree to access a hive of Meliponini.\nChimpanzee Tool Strategies in Honey-gathering 421\nbehaviors are probing, prying/digging, and lever-opening. Researchers have\nattributed multiple functions to chimpanzee tools at several sites, including Lossi\nand Goualougo in Republic of Congo (Lossi: Bermejo and Illera1999; Goualougo:\nthis study) and Loango in Gabon (Boeschet al. in press).\nTo examine whether tool dimensions differed between tool functions, we compiled\nthe diameter and length of tools reported from different sites. We excluded tools\nassociated with multiple functions from this comparison. Tools used to pound and lever-\nopen were consistently larger than tools used to dig, dip, and probe. Pounding (4.64±\n3.59 cm,n=48) and lever-opening (3.40±3.14 cm,n=68) tools had a larger diameter\nthan tools used to dig (1.67±1.25 cm,n=25), dip (0.98±0.37 cm,n=286), and probe\n(0.54±0.08 cm, n=179). Tools used to pound (59.99±18.60 cm,n=48) and lever-\nopen (59.83±34.67 cm,n=68) were longer than tools used to dig (44.15±17.59 cm,\nn=25), dip (49.93±20.54 cm, n=286), and probe (25.05±14.50 cm, n=179).\nHowever, one should interpret these results with caution because we found evidence\nthat terms were not used consistently to define tool behaviors across sites.\nDiscussion\nWe provide the first repeated direct observation and systematic documentation of\nchimpanzee tool use in honey-gathering in the Congo Basin. Researchers have\nobserved some of these behaviors (dip) in other populations of chimpanzees,\nwhereas others (pound/hammer) may be limited to this region.

The y-axis summarizes behavioral elements (whisk, pound, lever, dip,\nconserve tool, inspect hive, and reach goal) important in achieving the honey-gathering task (Sanz and\nMorgan, in press) and thex-axis shows the progression of behavioral elements as the chimpanzee foraged\nfor honey.(a) A tool-using episode of an adult female that used multiple tools to open a hive and then\nextract honey. The first 2 tools were stout branches used to pound the hive, while the third was a slender\ndipping probe fashioned from a twig. The first part of the episode was dominated by pounding actions that\nare separated by inspection of the hive. There were only 2 times that the chimpanzee consumed a small\namount of honey. After the hive was opened with the reuse of the first tool, the chimpanzee manufactured\na third tool to extract honey.(b) A tool using sequence of a juvenile male that first whisked away bees and\nthen used another tool to dip for honey. The chimpanzee discarded the dipping tool and then gathered\nhoney with his fingers, but subsequently manufactured another dipping tool. The chimpanzee then\nmanufactured a fourth tool to pound and lever the hive entrance. The final tool was used as a lever to open\nthe hive, after which the chimpanzee resumed eating honey.\n422 C.M. Sanz, D.B. Morgan\nbehaviors may have been misidentified across sites owing to the lack of precise\ndefinitions of tool actions or functions. However, pounding of beehives is a\ndistinctive behavior, with tools that surpass the size of any other honey-gathering\ntools used by wild chimpanzees (TableI). We confirm that pounding of beehives is\nhabitual, defined as “seen repeatedly in several individuals, consistent with some\ndegree of social transmission ” by Whiten et al. (1999, p. 1488) among the\npopulation of wild chimpanzees in the southern portion of the Nouabalé-Ndoki\nNational Park. Chimpanzees showed a high degree of persistence, as indicated by\nduration of tool using episodes and number of actions toward raiding beehives.\nPounding was the most successful technique to open a hive, but chimpanzees\nexhibited flexible strategies and insightful problem solving in honey-gathering. We\nmade repeated observations of sequential use of ≥2 types of tools, which is a\nbehavior pattern that is rarely observed in other wild ape populations (Foxet al.\n1999; Sugiyama1997). Although tools may initially be manufactured for a specific\nfunction, we also found that chimpanzees were capable of using a tool for multiple\nfunctions. Such complex and flexible tool using behavior has not previously been\nreported for chimpanzees in West or East Africa, suggesting that their may be\nspecific factors affecting their promulgation throughout this region.\nBees of Apis sp. and Meliponini occur throughout the range of all studied\nchimpanzee populations. It is plausible that bee ecology or hive structures vary\nacross the chimpanzee range, but we had the impression that each hive was\nstructurally unique and presented a challenge to the chimpanzee targeting it. This\nmay be due to the prevalence of mason and lodger bees that opportunistically exploit\nsubstrates to encase their hives. Such varied targets may necessitate the tool user to\npossess multiple tactics that can be flexibly implemented or hierarchically structured\nrelative to the conditions of each hive encountered.\nBrewer and McGrew (1990) defined the use of a tool set as the consecutive use of\n>1 type of tool for a single task. Chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle used\nmultiple tools in serial order, and showed hierarchical organization of tool-using\nbehaviors with opening tools and actions preceding those to extract honey. Brewer\nand McGrew (1990) reported a clear instance of serial tool use by a young female\nchimpanzee that used several tools to open a hive and extract honey. During their\nlong-term field research on gorillas in Republic of Congo, Bermejo and Illera (1999)\nobserved a chimpanzee using the opposite ends of a single tool as a chisel and a\nbodkin to open a beehive. Chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle regularly use tool\nsets in other foraging contexts (Sanzet al.2004), which could increase their overall\ntechnical competence or increase the likelihood of generalizing skills between tasks.\nIn particular, these chimpanzees seemed to have developed the technological skills\nof using certain tools to overcome the defenses of their prey, and then another tool to\ngather/extract the item. For example, a perforating twig is used to open the exit\ntunnels of termites on the outer surface of elevated termite nests, which provides\naccess for an herbaceous fishing probe used to extract the termites from the inner\nchambers of the nest. These chimpanzees also forage for termites in subterranean\nnests, which requires creating a tunnel into the nest with a stout puncturing stick, and\nthen using a fishing probe to extract the termites. We have recently documented\nanother tool set that is used by chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle to forage on\narmy ants.\nChimpanzee Tool Strategies in Honey-gathering 423\nChimpanzees in central Africa reside in sympatry with western lowland gorillas\nthroughout most of their range. There is a high degree of dietary overlap between\nthese species (Morgan and Sanz2006), which may have prompted the development\nof advanced tool behaviors in these chimpanzees. Tool use in foraging contexts has\nbeen suggested to provide increased access to resources that results in a net energy\ngain for the tool user. Gunther and Boesch (1993) found a nutritional return of 9\ntimes the energy output of nut-cracking behaviors. However, there are several\nindications that honey-gathering is a not a particularly beneficial foraging strategy.\nFirst, rewards for honey-gathering were variable and ranged from only a few drops\nof honey to several handfuls of comb. Even if bee larvae were consumed, the\nnutritional return of gathering wild honey, which is composed of 69–80% sugar\n(Roubik 1989), is not likely to provide remarkable nutritional returns for the amount\nof energy expended. Second, a high degree of effort was expended to open beehives\nand attempts were not always successful. The success rate for honey-gathering in\nGoualougo was only 52% for the episodes we observed, with an average of 6 tool\nactions required for each taste of honey. Third, there is an element of risk inherent in\nthis tool activity, which often occurs in the high canopy. Chimpanzees suspend\nthemselves at precarious angles to access beehives, and a juvenile fell to the ground\nwhile gathering honey on the side of a large tree. Finally, overcoming the defenses of\nthe beehives is technically challenging and there could be costs associated with\nindividually inventing effective tool behaviors. For example, we observed younger\nindividuals frequently engaging in tool practice, using a detached object in an\nappropriate fashion toward a location that did not contain honey or the hive was\nimpossible to open. Based on the widespread observations of hive pounding and\nhammering in this region, there is likely to be some social facilitation of tool\ntechniques. We observed tool transfer and sharing of tool sites between individuals,\nwhich is similar to a previous report of chimpanzees in the Taï forest sharing a honey\ndipping tool (Boesch and Boesch2000, p. 193).\nBased on our literature review and field research on this topic, we identified\nseveral steps that could advance the understanding of chimpanzee tool-using\nbehavior in honey-gathering. As demonstrated by recent reviews of chimpanzee\ntool use in army ant predation (Schöning et al. 2007), more systematic and\ncoordinated sampling of bee taxa across field sites is likely to provide important\ninformation about ecological factors influencing tool use in honey-gathering. Our\naim in compiling a list of tool behaviors observed in honey-gathering (TableIII) was\nto provide an ethogram for future observations that we hope will assist in\nstandardizing the identification of behaviors between sites. We strongly advocate\nthat scientists record video footage of tool-using behaviors because this provides the\nmeans to review each tool using episode for detailed information that can aid in\nidentifying or defining specific behaviors, measure interobserver reliability in\nidentifying tool behaviors, and share the observations with other scientists. Several\nscientists have discussed the possibility of creating a video ethogram of tool-using\nbehaviors for their individual site or as a collaborative effort among several sites,\nwhich would be an important resource that could greatly improve the quality of\ncomparisons across sites.\nThe rich behavioral diversity and technological traditions of wild chimpanzees\nhas important, but often overlooked conservation value. Each wild chimpanzee\n424 C.M. Sanz, D.B. Morgan\npopulation has a distinct repertoire of tool using behaviors, and the preservation of\nthese technological traditions should be another consideration for long-term\nconservation strategies (McGrew2004). Conservation initiatives on behalf of great\napes have focused on mitigating negative human impacts on ape density or\ndistribution, but it is important to determine whether human disturbances are\naffecting the traditional behaviors of wild apes. Expanding human influence on wild\norangutans and their behaviors prompted van Schaik ( 2001) to propose “The\nDisturbance Hypothesis for the Loss of Local Traditions in Orangutans,” which\nsuggests that local extinction, hunting pressure, logging, and habitat loss may disrupt\nthe transmission processes of traditional behaviors among wild apes. Initial studies\nof chimpanzees in the Congo Basin have expanded our understanding of the\nbehavioral diversity of this species, and future research promises even more\ndiscoveries that will be possible only if we ensure the long-term preservation of\nthese great apes and their habitats.\nAcknowledgments We thank the Ministry of Forest Economy of the Republic of Congo and the\nWildlife Conservation Society for their support and collaboration.
