    "abstract": "It has been proven that the introduction of the systems for continuous control of the power transformer technical state predetermines the need for improvement of the methods for calculation of the thermal modes, insulation wear and remaining service life of the equipment. Disadvantages of the existing methods recommended by domestic and foreign regulatory documents are noted. It is appeared to be practically to consider parameters of the environment, thermal mode retention and non-linearity of the thermal characteristics. The structure of algorithm for calculating temperature charts according to the load parameters with regard to the influence of the above factors is proposed. The developed software is briefly specified, too. The ultimate purpose is to develop and study the improved model for thermal characteristic calculation designed for the systems of on-line monitoring transformer technical state.",
