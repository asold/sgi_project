    "abstract": "Defect object detection for printed circuit boards (PCBs) is one of the most important tasks in the field of industrial inspections. For this task, deep learning-based object detection algorithms are generally used. Regardless of whether one-stage or two-stage object detection algorithms are used, image features are extracted using multi-layer convolutional neural networks, which makes it hard to focus on global features. Few methods use Transformer-based models to extract features because of their computational complexity, which is proportional to the square of the length of the input, and they also lack the ability to extract multi-scale features. In our paper, we design a variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract features at multiple scales. We use a multi-stage ViT to extract image features, and then 1 × 1 convolution is used to connect the adjacent stages to enhance the feature dimensionality. Although the conventional ViT does not have the ability to extract multi-scale features, we use convolution to downsample the output of each stage of the ViT to obtain multi-scale features of the image. The size and stride of the convolution kernel used to downsample also change as the feature dimensionality changes. In addition, to reduce the computational complexity, we introduce window attention into each stage of the ViT, and as the feature dimensionality changes, the window size also changes. We construct a feature pyramid network and a path aggregation network based on the multi-scale features obtained as described above, and we adopt the detection head from YOLOx to implement the final multi-scale ViT-based object detection algorithm. Experimental results show that our improved model achieves a mean average precision of 69.3% on the MSCOCO 2017 test dataset, 86.0% on the PASCAL VOC 2007 test dataset, and 99.9% on our PCB ultrasonic image dataset.",
