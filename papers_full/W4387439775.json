  "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image sizeThis article refers to:AUTOGEN: A Personalized Large Language Model for Academic Enhancement—Ethics and Proof of Principle DISCLOSURE STATEMENTNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1 In this commentary, we will limit our remarks to issues that are unique to AUTOGEN and will not address broader issues related to the use of LLMs in research (see Hosseini et al. Citation2023a, Citation2023b). Furthermore, we will focus our criticism on examining the potential outcomes of using AUTOGEN to improve productivity.Additional informationFundingDr. Resnik's contribution to this editorial was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH).
