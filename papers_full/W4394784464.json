Email:\nm.amanzadeh@arums.ac.ir\nReceived2024January9;Revised2024February21;Accepted2024March12.\nKeywords: Large Language Model, LLM, Medical Education, ChatGPT\nDear Editor,\nIn recent years, the integration of artificial\nintelligence (AI) technologies (1, 2) into medical\neducation has brought significant advancements,\nparticularly through the development of large language\nmodels (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Bard. These AI-based\ntools have transformed medical education by offering\nnew ways to learn and teach (3). This letter explores the\nrole of large language models in modern medical\neducation, highlighting both opportunities and\nchallenges.\nLarge language models represent the cutting edge in\nAI, using deep neural networks to generate responses\nthat mimic human conversation (2). The ability of LLM-\nbased tools, such as ChatGPT and Bard, to engage in\ninteractive discussions and provide relevant\ninformation has made them invaluable in education (2).\nThey hold the promise of altering traditional learning\nmethodologies, fostering skill development, and\nencouraging cooperative learning.\nKey applications of LLM in medical education\ninclude:\n1. Virtual Teaching Assistant\nLarge language models, like ChatGPT, can serve as\nvirtual teaching assistants. Their capability to quickly\nprovide information on a wide range of medical\nsubjects around the clock makes them an invaluable\nresource for students (4). ChatGPT is adept at answering\ndiverse questions related to medical topics, including\nanatomy and physiology, and can even suggest further\nstudy resources when necessary. Furthermore, this\nsystem has the ability to create a variety of exercises and\nassignments for students (5).\n2. Interactive Learning and Knowledge Acquisition\nUnlike conventional education methods, which often\nrely on passive delivery of information, LLMs promote\nan interactive learning experience. This approach\nfacilitates active participation, enhances critical\nthinking, and ensures learners remain abreast of the\nlatest medical developments and treatments (6).\n3. Personalized Learning and Adaptive Teaching\nPersonalized learning and adaptive teaching\naccommodate the unique needs and preferences of each\nstudent. Large language models are capable of tailoring\nthemselves to match the requirements and capabilities\nof individual learners by offering personalized learning\npaths. They can adjust the content, pace, and complexity\nbased on the learner's knowledge and skills, providing\nexplanations, guidance, and resources that are\nspecifically suited to their needs (7). Through ongoing\ninteraction, LLMs can track students' progress, pinpoint\nareas where knowledge is lacking, and supply targeted\nresources and exercises for additional learning. This\nadaptive method fosters personalized learning, boosts\nstudent engagement, and improves the learning\nexperience.\n4. Clinical Reasoning and Decision Support\nFor healthcare professionals, clinical reasoning is\nessential. Large language models can simulate patient\nMahdavi A et al.\n2 Shiraz E-Med J. 2024; 25(5): e144847.\nscenarios, guiding learners through diagnostic\nprocesses and treatment decisions. By presenting\ncomplex cases, these models challenge students to apply\ntheir knowledge practically, thereby bridging the gap\nbetween theory and practice. The integration of LLMs\ninto medical education presents a promising future,\ntransforming learning experiences, personalizing\neducation, and preparing students for real-world\nclinical challenges (8).\n5. Continuous Assessment and Rapid Feedback\nAssessment plays a crucial role in medical education\nby offering feedback on students' knowledge, skills, and\nabilities. Large language models-based tools deliver\ninstant feedback on student performance, assessing\ntheir diagnostic and communication abilities. They also\nevaluate adherence to evidence-based guidelines and\nbest practices, identifying knowledge gaps and\nweaknesses, thereby enhancing self-assessment skills\nand encouraging focused learning (4).\n6. Research Assistant\nAs research assistants, LLMs support medical\nstudents in various research tasks, such as developing\nresearch plans, formulating research questions,\nconducting literature reviews, translating articles,\nsummarizing scientific papers, and analyzing data. They\nalso help in summarizing relevant articles and\nidentifying key findings, enabling efficient navigation\nof the vast amount of information available online (5).\nWhile LLM-based tools in medical education offer\npromising opportunities, it's crucial to address\npotential ethical concerns and risks.\n7. Privacy and Data Security\nIntegrating LLMs in medical education necessitates\nensuring patient data privacy and security. It's\nimperative to implement robust data protection\nmeasures, including encryption, access controls, and\nsecure storage, to safeguard patient confidentiality.\nWhen using patient data with LLM tools, obtaining\nexplicit consent is essential (9).\n8. Bias and Discrimination\nAI systems, including LLMs, can inherit biases from\ntheir training data. These biases can perpetuate\nhealthcare inequalities and exacerbate disparities. For\ninstance, studies have shown that models like ChatGPT\nmight reproduce gender and racial biases (10). In\nmedical education, this issue could lead to inaccurate\ninformation or discriminatory experiences, limiting\ndiverse perspectives. Addressing and mitigating bias in\nLLM outputs is critical for ensuring fairness and\nequality.\n9. Ensuring Accuracy and Reliability\nThe accuracy and reliability of information provided\nby LLM-based tools are paramount in medical\neducation, where inaccuracies can have serious\nimplications. Despite being trained on vast datasets,\nerrors and issues with the quality of training data can\noccur. Ensuring the use of high-quality, up-to-date\nmedical data and implementing verification\nmechanisms are crucial for maintaining accuracy and\npreventing misinformation (11).\n10. Maintaining Professionalism\nThe use of LLMs in medical education raises\nquestions about maintaining professionalism. Although\nthese tools can simulate patient interactions and\nprovide diagnostic suggestions, the importance of real\npatient and healthcare professional interactions cannot\nbe understated. It's vital for students to understand the\nlimitations of LLMs and for machine-generated\nresponses to be clearly identified as such to prevent\nconfusion and misinformation (12).\n11. Over-Reliance on Technology\nOver-reliance on technology, particularly on LLMs,\ncould detract from students' development of critical\nthinking and medical knowledge. Although LLMs offer\nan enriched learning experience, it's vital to maintain a\nbalance between technological aids and human\nexpertise. Excessive dependence on LLMs for\ninformation and decision-making may impede the\ncultivation of critical thinking abilities and clinical\njudgment. It's imperative for students to critically assess\nand verify information provided by LLMs (4).\n12. Increase in Cheating\nThere's a concern that reliance on tools like ChatGPT\nmight encourage academic dishonesty or \"cheating,\"\nwhere a student might use ChatGPT for completing\nassignments without fully understanding the content\nor solutions. To mitigate this risk, educators should set\nclear guidelines and communicate the implications of\nacademic dishonesty, alongside promoting assignments\nthat demand critical thinking, creativity, and synthesis\nof information, and employing plagiarism detection\ntools (6).\nMahdavi A et al.\nShiraz E-Med J. 2024; 25(5): e144847. 3\n13. Accountability and Transparency\nAs LLMs become increasingly integrated into medical\neducation, establishing accountability and\ntransparency is essential. Institutions should develop\nclear guidelines on the usage of LLM-based tools,\ndelineating their limitations, risks, and appropriate\napplications. Mechanisms for reporting concerns about\nbias, inaccuracies, or ethical issues are also necessary\n(6).\nWhile LLMs offer the potential to revamp clinical\nreasoning and assessment, they should complement\nrather than replace human expertise, critical thought,\nand compassionate patient care. Students are\nencouraged to scrutinize and appraise the information\nprovided by these systems, viewing them as adjuncts to\ntheir learning. The implementation of LLMs promises to\nrevolutionize the acquisition of knowledge, the\ndevelopment of clinical skills, and foster collaborative\nlearning, preparing future healthcare professionals for\nevidence-based and empathetic care.\nFootnotes\nAuthors' Contribution: Conception and design of the\nstudy were carried out by M.A., A.M., and M.H.
