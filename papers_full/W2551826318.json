I NTRODUCTION\nMany changes in the past 15 years lead the distribution\ngrids to new assets. The increasing penetration of distributed\npower generation (DPG) such as photovoltaics [1], [2], wind\nturbine systems [3] and combined heat and power (CHP)\n[4] systems has heavily affected the medium voltage (MV)\nand low voltage (LV) grids, impacting mostly on the grid\nmanagement. In addition, new loads such as electric vehicle\ncharging stations are introduced into the grid. As a result,\nvoltage constraints [5]- [6] and line ampacity violations, in\naddition to a poor power quality (harmonics, ﬂicker, voltage\ndrops) [7], are increasingly present in the distribution grids.\nIt is worth adding how the “ﬁt and forget” policies for the\nDPG integration adopted in the last years have worsened the\nalready difﬁcult situation. The inadequate spread of DPG in\nthe territory has brought to severe limitations of grid hosting\ncapability. Particular attention is dedicated on the presence\nof harmonics in the grid: in case of massive penetration of\nDPG, the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) limit imposed by\nthe national regulatory frameworks is easily exceeded, and\nthis represents a bottleneck in the amount of DPG that can\nbe installed [8]. Mostly, the concerns of distribution system\noperators (DSO) are to build new infrastructure in order to\nmeet the new loads and DPG requests and not violate the\nvoltage and current limits. This represents a non cost-effective\nsolution, both in economical and technical terms.\nMany approaches have been proposed for solving the\naforementioned issues, such as active demand or real-time\nmanagement of distributed energy resources (DER). In this\ndirection the smart metering plays a key role in the realization,\nbut it comes at a cost. Indeed, the number of appliances present\nin a LV or MV grid can be so large that monitoring all of\nthem is not a simple task: the big data problem in the smart\nmetering remains still one of the major challenge in the future\nsmart grids [9].\nThe smart transformer (ST) solution [10] can deal with the\nintegration of the DPGs and new loads, offering a good power\nquality at the same time. The ST is a solid-state transformer,\nalready adopted in railway, harbor and data center applications.\nThe use in the electric grid can lead to a great change,\nwhere the transformer is still a traditional component, without\n“smart” features. The ST can perform tasks a traditional\ntransformer cannot achieve, as for example unbalanced control\nof voltage and power [11]. In order to provide services to the\ngrid, a frequency different from the fundamental can be used.\nIn communication systems multiple frequencies are used to\ntransmit information independently within a medium among\nseveral senders and receivers. Recently, multi-frequency ap-\nproaches emerge to transfer power in the kilowatt range. In\n[12] a distributed power ﬂow controller (DPFC) is proposed,\nwhich is based on the utilization of the 3rd harmonic to\ntransfer power between shunt and series inverters through the\nline. Compared to the uniﬁed power ﬂow controller (UPFC)\nit has the advantage of avoiding a common dc-link between\nshunt and series compensator, thus decreasing the cost of\nthe system. Moreover, multiple single-phase inverters can be\nused as series compensator offering an additional redundancy\nin case of series inverter failures and further cost reduction\ndue to lower ratings of the components. In [13], [14] it is\nproposed to use an additional frequency in multilevel modular\nconverters (MMC) to implement nestled secondary power\nloops in order to balance the voltages across the sub-module\ncapacitors, independently of the main power loop. Another\nﬁeld of application is the inductive power transfer (IPT) by\nmeans of multiple frequencies [15], where single-frequency\npick-ups can be tuned to different transmission frequencies\nreceiving power simultaneously and independently.\nThis paper shows the possibility of multi-frequency power\ntransfer (MF-PT) in presence of a ST in a distribution grid.\nPulse width modulated voltage source inverters (PWM-VSI)\nhave the capability to modulate more than one output fre-\nquency. Utilizing this potential a different frequency from the\nfundamental frequency can be used to send power from one\nDistribution Grid\nST\ndirect path at \nfrequency fT\nMain Grid\nS\nR\nFig. 1. Multi-frequency operation in a ST based distribution grid where S is\nthe sender and R is the receiver\npoint to another part of the network. The focus of this work\nis to investigate the synchronization between the senders and\nreceivers and to show the advantages and drawbacks of multi-\nfrequency grid operations.\nIn Section II the potentials and limitations of MF-PT are\ndiscussed, followed by a description of a possible current-\ncontrol scheme in Section III, which enables MF-PT for PWM-\nVSIs. Finally, simulation results are presented in Section IV,\nwhere the functionality of the proposed control scheme is\nveriﬁed. In addition, the impact of MF-PT in a distribution\ngrid gets analyzed. Conclusions are ﬁnally drawn in Section\nV.\nII. M ULTI -FREQUENCY POWER TRANSFER : POTENTIALS\nAND LIMITATIONS\nAs far as the general literature concerns, signal frequencies\napart from the line frequency at 50/60 Hz have been treated\nas a disturbance in the grid or they have been used for\ncommunication purpose [16]. The impact of harmonics on the\nlifetime of the transformer [17]–[19], the increase of losses in\nthe grid [20], and the limitation on the breaking capacity of the\nbreakers [21] are well known. The voltage harmonics involve\nmostly the transformer level, affecting the ﬂux. The current\nharmonics, instead, introduce higher heating losses, due to the\nrising of the Root Mean Square (RMS) value of the current\n[22]. In [18] the evaluation of the transformer loss of life due\nto the harmonics has been critically described. The harmonics\naffects also the rotating machine creating a pulsating torque,\nproduced due to the interaction of the harmonics magnetic\nﬁeld and the fundamental one [21]. The presence of a large\npopulation of distributed generators in the grid cause high\ncurrent harmonics that can introduce resonance problems. If\none of the current harmonics corresponds to the resonance\nfrequency of the grid, high voltage distortion occurs in the\ngrid [23].\nThe proposed approach aims to use an additional transmis-\nsion frequency fT different from the fundamental frequency,\nto send power to a particular receiver located in another part\nof the grid. The concept is shown in Fig.1. It is based on\nthe fact that the current ﬂows through the lower impedance\npath, represented by the circuit between the sender and the\nreceiver, without involving the local loads. The simulation\nresults in Section IV describe how the current component of\nthe frequency fT does not affect the local loads, but only\nthe line linking the converters. The main advantage of this\napproach is the possibility to transmit energy from point to\npoint in the grid. Through this capability, an energy storage\nsystem can be charged independently from the line frequency.\nThis can be used for a power ﬂow management to smooth the\npower variation at transformer level, for example. If the power\nsuddenly decreases the storage system is discharged at line\nfrequency, while it is still receiving power at the frequency fT.\nAnother possible application is islanding prevention. When the\ncurrent capacity of the line at transformer level is reached, it\nis possible to send power from one part of the distribution grid\nto where it is required, not affecting the current congestion.\nIn this paper the third harmonic has been chosen as carrier\nfrequency fT for the above mentioned extra services, because\nthis harmonic has the lowest limitations in grid standards [24].\nCurrents and voltages are supposed to be of direct sequence, in\nphase respectively with the 50 Hz currents and voltages. The\nreasoning behind this choice lies in the cross components of the\npower: indeed, applying a direct sequence for 150 Hz voltage\nand current instead of a zero-sequence, leads the system to\nhave an oscillating power of 2nd harmonic instead one of\n6th harmonic. The result is the avoidance of higher frequency\noscillating power and the effect is the reduction of the losses\nand interferences with the grid communication system. Consid-\nering the aforementioned hypothesis, the voltage and current\nequations systems are implemented as follows:\nva = V1sin(ωt) + V3sin(3ωt)\nvb = V1sin(ωt + 120◦) + V3sin(3ωt + 120◦)\nvc = V1sin(ωt + 240◦) + V3sin(3ωt + 240◦)\n(1)\nia = I1sin(ωt + ϕ1) + I3sin(3ωt + ϕ3)\nib = I1sin(ωt + 120◦ + ϕ1) + I3sin(3ωt + 120◦ + ϕ3)\nic = I1sin(ωt + 240◦ + ϕ1) + I3sin(3ωt + 240◦ + ϕ3) .\n(2)\nLooking to the equations (1) and (2) the 50 Hz and 150 Hz\nvoltage components are supposed to be in phase. The currents\ndiffer only for the angle ϕ. In order to compute the power ﬂows\nand evaluate the impact of the 150 Hz components in the grid,\nthe pq theory has been chosen. The real and imaginary power\nare deﬁned as [25]:\np(t) = Va ∗Ia + Vb ∗Ib + Vc ∗Ic (3)\nq(t) = 1√\n3 [(Vb −Vc) ∗Ia + (Vc −Va) ∗Ib + (Va −Vb) ∗Ic] .\n(4)\nCarrying out the products between voltage and current equa-\ntions, the instantaneous and imaginary power has been ob-\ntained:\np(t) = ¯p(t) + ˜p(t) = 3\n2 [V1I1cos(ϕ1) + V3I3cos(ϕ3)\n+V1I3cos(2ωt + ϕ3) + V3I1cos(−2ωt + ϕ1)] .\n(5)\nq(t) = ¯q(t) + ˜q(t) = −3\n2 [V1I1sin(ϕ1) + V3I3sin(ϕ3)\n−V3I1sin(2ωt −ϕ1) −V1I3sin(−2ωt −ϕ3)] .\n(6)\nH-VSI\niinv\nLf,1\nCf\nLf,2\niPCC\nVDC vinv vPCC\nPR\nCurrent \nControl\nPWM IPCC,50*\nPLL50\nθPCC,50\nIPCC,150*\nθPCC,150\nPLL150\nHDN\n+\nMSOGI\nFLL\nFig. 2.

C ONTROL OF PWM-VSI AS SENDERS AND\nRECEIVERS\nTo control the power transmission between the sender and\nreceiver, different strategies are conceivable. In general, a\nPWM-VSI can be operated to act as a voltage or current source\nby applying a voltage control (VC) or current control (CC)\nscheme, respectively. An overview of the possible concepts\nin a ST based distribution grid is given in Table I. In the\nﬁrst approach, both the sender and receiver behave as current\nsources, while the ST regulates the voltage in the network,\nproviding a 50 Hz and 150 Hz component. In the second and\nthird concepts, either the sender or the receiver is operated\nas a voltage source, while the other represents a current\nsource. The inverter with VC regulates the 150 Hz component\nof the voltage in the network, whereas the ST controls the\n50 Hz voltage component. The fourth approach consists of two\nvoltage sources as sender and receiver.\nIn this paper the ﬁrst concept is discussed in order to show\nthe functionality of multi-frequency grid operation and the\nimpact on other loads in the network. A detailed comparison\nof the four approaches will be subject to future work. It is\nassumed that the control schemes of the sender and receiver\nare identical. The current control strategy of a PWM based\nsingle-phase H-bridge VSI with LCL-ﬁlter is shown in Fig.2.\nDue to the ability of tracking high frequency sinusoidal\nreferences a P+Resonant (PR) controller with harmonic com-\nTABLE I. C ONTROL STRATEGIES IN ST BASED DISTRIBUTION GRID\nConcept Sender Receiver\nI CC CC\nII CC VC\nIII VC CC\nIV VC VC\npensator (HC) is chosen for current control [26], which are\ndeﬁned as:\nGPR(s) = KP + KI\ns\ns2 + ω2\n0\n(7)\nGHC(s) =\n∑\nn=3,5,7,...\nKI,n\ns\ns2 + (ω0n)2 . (8)\nTypically, the HC is tuned to compensate the current harmonics\nof the 3rd, 5th and 7th order as they are the most present\nharmonics of the grid current. In this scheme the capability to\ncontrol harmonics is used to track the 150 Hz reference instead\nof compensation purposes.\nFor grid synchronization a synchronous reference frame\nbased phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) [27] is implemented for\neach frequency (50 Hz and 150 Hz). By applying two frequen-\ncies the voltage at the output of the LCL-ﬁlter is superimposed,\nnaturally, for which reason ﬁltering of the measured signal\nbecomes inevitable. Therefore a frequency adaptive multiple\nsecond order generalized integrator frequency-locked loop\nscheme (MSOGI-FLL) [28] is added to the PLL. In combina-\ntion with a harmonic decoupling network (HDN) the MSOGI-\nFLL is capable of detecting the fundamental frequency and its\nrelevant harmonics under highly distorted grid conditions that\nmakes it suitable for multi-frequency power transfer.\nThe VDC is assumed to be constant, hence no VDC con-\ntroller has been implemented.\nIV. S IMULATION RESULTS\nThe aim of this section is to show the effectiveness of\nthe power converter control strategies described in Section\nIII to transfer power point-to-point and its impact on a low\nvoltage distribution grid. Particular attention has been paid to\nthe power quality at loads level, underlining the impact of the\n150 Hz components in the grid. This section is divided into\nthree subsections: the ﬁrst subsection introduces the model of\nthe tested distribution grid; the second subsection shows the\nresults of the application of two current-controlled VSIs in\nparallel; the third subsection analyzes the impact of the 150 Hz\ncomponent on the loads.\nA. Model of the Tested Distribution Grid\nHere a 8-bus LV grid is proposed, as show in Fig. 3. A ST\nhas been chosen as interface with the main grid, acting like a\nslack bus. The sender is located at bus 4 and the receiver at\nbus 7, linked by line 6. Table II gives the lines conﬁguration,\nwith the resistance and inductance values.\nTable III deploys the amount of load in the grid, assuming\nthe load balanced. The composite loads have been modeled as\nsuggested by [29], considering the loads voltage and frequency\ndependency. Both industrial, commercial and residential ty-\npologies have been chosen, in order to obtain an heterogeneous\ngrid. The total amount of power requested by ST is 125 kW\nwith an average cosϕ = 0.86.\nB.

The ST is modeled as a constant\nvoltage source with an amplitude of 325 V at 50 Hz and an\namplitude of 5% of the fundamental value at 150 Hz, connected\nto the VSI through the impedance Zg (Table II, line 1+3). The\nsender is controlled in such a way as it receives current at\n50 Hz and sends current at 150 Hz into the grid. In contrast,\nthe receiver receives current at 150 Hz and provides current at\n50 Hz.\nAs it is shown in Fig. 5(a) the references of the 50 Hz\ncurrents are held constant. Moreover, all current references\nare in phase with the grid voltage, thus only active power ﬂow\nis considered. The 150 Hz-power proﬁle depicted in Fig. 5(b)\ncan be split into two phases. In the ﬁrst phase the sender\nVSI\nST\nZline,6\nSender\nZ =g Zline,1+3\nVSI\nReceiver\nFig. 4. Two VSIs in parallel as sender and receiver\nand receiver are not synchronized, resulting in a distorted grid\ncurrent ig (see Fig. 6(a)). In the second phase the amplitudes of\nthe 150 Hz current references are set equal. In consequence, the\nmagnitudes of the 150 Hz power become equal, too, except for\na small variation due to the losses in the line. As a result it can\nbe seen in Fig. 6(b) that the grid current ig has no component\nat 150 Hz and therefore the it is nearly undistorted. The current\nbehavior during the transition from phase I to phase II is shown\nin Fig. 7.\nOn the basis of this behavior it can be concluded that the\nsender and the receiver need to be well synchronized in order\nto avoid unwanted distortions of the grid current. The analysis\nand realization of an optimal communication between sender\nand receiver is subject of future work.\nC. Impact of MF-PT on the Grid\nA steady state simulation has been performed, based on\nthe grid described above. For the evaluation of the proposed\napproach we have considered the following hypothesis: 1)\ncurrent injection and absorption are synchronized between the\ntwo converters in order to take in account the losses caused\nby the 150 Hz current, 2) there is no reactive power injected\n(sender) or absorbed (receiver) by the converters, 3) the lines\nare oversized, so they can manage the injection of the 150 Hz\ncurrent component, and 4) the ST acts as slack bus imposing\n0\n5\n10\n15\n(a)\nI*\nPCC,50 (A)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n(b)\nI*\nPCC,150 (A)\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n(c)\n|P150 Hz| (W)\nTime (s)\nFig. 5.

These hypotheses avoid the increase of the current and\nvoltage THD, due to the reduction of 150 Hz current withdrawn\nfrom the grid. The 150 Hz active power generated from the\nsender is 9.18 kW, while the power absorbed by the receiver\nis 6.65 kW, and the ST supplies 0.21 kW the grid\nIf the overall efﬁciency of power transfer is deﬁned as the\nreceiver’s absorbed power divided by the sum of the sender’s\ngenerated power and the ST’s supplied power, it stands around\n70.8%. The remaining 29,2% represents the losses along the\nlines and the 150 Hz current absorbed by the loads. Table IV\nshows the voltage and current THD, after the application of\nthe proposed approach. The voltage THD in the grid is in each\npoint below 5%, being in agreement with the standard [24].\nThe current THD lies around 4%, avoiding great disturbances\nfor the loads.\nTABLE IV .

Fig. 8 verify what can be\ninferred from the mathematical formulation: a 2nd harmonic\ncomponent is present in the power proﬁles, creating oscillating\npowers. The oscillating component in the instantaneous power\nis relevant when referred to the two converters (Fig. 8 (a)-(d)),\nwhere the capacitors in the DC links works as a storage,\nbut it becomes negligible when referred to the ST (Fig. 8 (e)).\nThe imaginary power, being composed only by an oscillating\ncomponent, represents only the imaginary power exchanged\namong the phases, and so it does not involve any power\ntransferred in the grid.\nRegarding the impact on the loads, Fig.9 shows the in-\nstantaneous and imaginary power proﬁle of the Commercial\nLoad (Fig.9 (a)) and the Residential Load 1 (Fig.9 (b)) placed\nrespectively in bus 5 and 7. The Residential Load 1 has been\nchosen because its high current and voltage THD, instead\nthe Commercial Load has been chosen because it takes place\nin the same bus as the receiver. As can be deducted Fig.9\nactive and reactive absorption of power are not affected by\nthe 150 Hz power transmission. The instantaneous power of\nthe Commercial Load shows how the oscillating power (2nd\nharmonic component) is far smaller than the active power\n(constant component). The same results valid for the reactive\npower absorption. This trend demonstrates how the loads are\n−30\n−15\n0\n15\n30\npsender (kW)\n(a)\n−30\n−15\n0\n15\n30\nqsender (kVAi)\n(b)\n−30\n−15\n0\n15\n30\npreceiver (kW)\n(c)\n−30\n−15\n0\n15\n30\nqreceiver (kVAi)\n(d)\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.100\n50\n100\n150\np,qST (kW,kVAi)\nTime (s)\n(e)\nFig. 8.

C ONCLUSION\nThis paper has investigated the possibility to manage\npower transfer at different frequencies in a smart transformer\nbased distribution grid. The presented approach enables the\npower transfer point-to-point in the grid, exploiting the lower\nimpedance path that the two converters offer to the energy. The\nresulting impact on the loads is still small in comparison with\nthe power injected and can be reduced further if an optimal\nsynchronization is adopted. This approach shows a promising\nway to provide service in the future smart grid remaining in\ncompliance with the actual harmonics standards.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe research leading to these results has received funding\nfrom the European Research Council under the European\nUnions Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC\nGrant Agreement n.
