Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) using Large Language Models (LLMs) are \namong the next big things and all domains would do well to adapt and adopt the new \ntechnology. As the UNESCO framework for the adoption of Information and Communication \nTechnologies (ICTs) (2018) emphasizes, incorporating technological developments is essential \n\nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 2  \n \n \nand inevitable, but the important thing to ensure is that those who use these technologies \ndevelop appropriate competencies that will enable them to use the technologies ethically and \nsustainably to build an equitable, peaceful and fair ecosystem (p.7). The responsibility to develop \nsuch competencies and transfer them to the younger generation is compounded in the field of \neducation since for sustainable development, education is the only domain, one may argue, that \ncould bring about transformation from the grassroots and empower individuals with the \n“knowledge, skills, and attitudes” imperative to sustainable development (UNESCO, 2017, p. 7). \nOf the eight competencies UNESCO identifies for Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) \n- Systems thinking, Anticipatory, Normative, Strategic, Collaboration, Critical thinking, Self -\nawareness, and Integrated problem -solving (p. 10) - no one competency is expected to be \ntaught or acquired in isolation. In fact, these competencies form part of the metanarrative on \nliteracy proposed by UNESCO (2023). Cognizant of the necessity to have a similar all -\nencompassing approach to literacy in the face of rapid technological advancements, especially \nin the digital world, researchers have for some years now explored various iterations of Critical \nDigital Literacy (CDL). However, as digital innovations in AI like LLMs are on the rise, literacy as \nenvisioned in the educational domain must build  further on the ‘critical’ and ‘digital’ in ‘critical \ndigital literacy’ to account for AI. Since LLMs are advancements in Natural Language Processing \n(NLP) (Milano, McGrane, & Leonelli, 2023), it seems natural to focus our efforts on developing \nrelevant critical AI literacy in language education. English language has a global reach in the \ndigital world (Lazou & Tsinakos, 2023), and therefore, English language teaching would be an \nexcellent opportunity to develop relevant literacies to critically navigate the digital world. While \nthe field of CDL in language education is well-researched, there are few pedagogical frameworks \non incorporating emerging technological advancements like LLMs in teaching learning of \nlanguages (Kostka & Toncelli, 2023, p.4). This paper aims to propose a framework for Critical AI \nLiteracy (CAIL) that could be used when integrating LLMs like ChatGPT -3 in language classes. \nThe framework would be synthesized based on the cognitive, affective, and conative domains of \nESD to ensure that Critical AI Literacy would empower individuals towards sustainable cognitive \nstructures. \n \nCritical Digital Literacy \nThe foundations of critical digital literacy is in the confluence of academic preoccupations with \nthe concept of literacy that went beyond mere reading, writing, or technical skills, and included \nraising awareness about the socio-cultural, political and ultimately the power equations involved \nin the use of language, and the role of digital technology in everyday experiences and meaning-\nmaking (Pötzsch, 2019; Bacalja, Aguilera, & Castrillon -Angel, 2021). CDL involves an \nunderstanding of the sociocultural implications in the permeation of digital technologies into \neveryday living while exploring its contextual and cultural dimensions. True to its roots in critical \nliteracy, CDL promotes a transformative pedagogy in an attempt to engender a more equitable, \nempowered and inclusive society (Pangrazio, 2016). \nJoseph, S. | Page 3  \n \n \n \nEducation for Sustainable Development \nThe eight competencies that UNESCO ESD propounds intend to achieve cognitive development, \nattitudinal change and sustainable action -oriented disposition in learners. Systems thinking \nencourages individuals to understand how systems function in themselves and within contexts. \nAnticipatory competency enables individuals to think in terms of future actions, consequences, \nand risks. Normative competency enlightens the ideological context in which individuals exist \nand provides opportunities to negotiate conflicting situations mindful of all concerned. Strategic \ncompetency is about action in the local context and beyond to promote sustainability. \nCollaborative competency as the term suggests encourages individuals to be open to multiple \nperspectives and be able to resolve conflicts and solve problems in the multidimensional \ncontexts. Critical thinking empowers individuals to question one’s own and others’ norms, \nvalues, and belief systems which taking a stance on sustainability. Self -awareness is an attitude \nof understanding oneself as a local and global agent of action. Integrated problem solving \nintegrates all competencies and enables individuals to be inclusive and equitable when solving \nproblems sustainably. The Systems thinking, Normative, and Critical thinking competencies \nseem to promote cognitive transformation, while the Anticipatory, Strategic, and Integrated \nproblem-solving competencies encourage action. Collaborative and Self -awareness \ncompetencies seem more inclined to encourage attitudinal transformation towards compassion, \nrespect, inclusion, and equitable practices. For Critical AI literacy to be aligned to education for \nsustainable development, the CAIL skills should be a combination of cognitive, affective and \nconative elements. \n \nMethodology \nThis research follows the premises of the Integrative literature review methodology as \ndelineated by Torraco (2016). Integrative literature review is the recommended methodology \nwhen developing frameworks for relatively new fields of study (Torraco, 2005; Whittemore & \nKnafl, 2005; Snyder, 2019). The process involves establishing the need for integrative literature \nreview, conducting the review, analyzing and synthesizing the findings. Torraco (2005, 2016), \nalso states that synthesis in integrative literature review provides opportunities for establishing \nnew relationships between concepts from diverse disciplines. In this paper, an attempt is to use \nan integrative literature review approach to synthesize the recommendations of ESD with the \nexisting research on CDL to propose a framework for the newly emerging field of Critical AI \nLiteracy (CAIL) in language education. The review was informed by the PRISMA flow diagram \n(Figure 1) developed by Page et al. (2021) and it used a specific set of search strings (Table 1). \nThe researcher explored peer-reviewed journal articles published in English between 2018 and \n2023 and indexed in databases like Google Scholar and Science Direct. 2018 was used as the \nstarting point for the integrative review since it was in June 2018 that OpenAI lunched GPT-1 the \nprecursor to GPT-3 and now GPT -4 (Ray, 2023) which has sent the academic community into a \nflurry of activity about incorporating LLMs in education.   \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 4  \n \n \nThe initial search yielded 1038 records which were reviewed and 1009 abstracts and titles were \nscreened using the criteria (Table 2) formulated based on the research objective. 927 search \nrecords were removed and 82 potential papers were identified for in depth screening. After \nexcluding papers that did not provide any explicit framework for teaching critical digital literacy, \nor were focused only on defining the concept, or were not about language teaching, or were \ntargeted specifically toward pre -service/teacher training, 17 peer -reviewed articles were finally \nselected for in depth study. \n \n \nFigure 1: Adaptation of PRISMA flow diagram 2020 \nTopic Search term \nCritical digital literacy Critical digital literacy \nAND \nLanguage Teaching \n“English” OR “English as Second language” \nOR “English as Foreign language” \nTable 1: Initial search string \nRecords identified from*: \nGoogle Scholar (n = 1006) \nScienceDirect (n = 32) \nAbstracts and Titles screened \n(n = 1009) \nPapers excluded \n(n = 892+25+10 = 927) \nPotential papers sought for retrieval \n(n = 82) \nPapers not retrieved \n(n = 12) \nFull text papers assessed for eligibility \n(n = 70) \n Papers excluded: \nNo explicit framework for critical \ndigital literacy teaching (n = 16) \nFocused only on re/defining the \nconcept (n = 7) \nNot about language teaching (n = \n21) \nFor pre-service teachers or teacher \ntraining (n = 9) \nStudies included in review \n(n = 17) \nIdentification \nScreening \n \nIncluded \nJoseph, S. | Page 5  \n \n \n \nInclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria \nPublished between 2018 -\n2023 \nEnglish Language \nIndexed in Google Scholar \nand ScienceDirect \nPeer-reviewed Journal \narticles \nFramework for Critical digital \nliteracy identified \nThe context of research is \nEnglish language classroom  \nPublished before 2018 \nNot in English \nNot Peer -reviewed Journal \narticles \nConference Proceedings \nPolicy reports \nThesis \nDissertations \nNo framework for Critical \ndigital literacy \nNot situated in English \nlanguage classes \nTable 2: Inclusion and Exclusion criteria \nOne of the limitations of this integrative review study would be the exclusion of variants of \ncritical digital literacy nomenclature. Moreover, the study is limited to articles published in \nEnglish and those that appear in the two databases.   \nThe articles identified were synthesized using the ESD competencies domains namely, the \ncognitive, affective and conative. The CDL framework proposed in each of the 17 studies was \nmapped to these three domains. The mapping revealed the extent to which the proposed CDL \nframeworks aligned with the sustainable pedagogy outlined by UNESCO’s ESD. \n \nResults \nThe 17 articles that were reviewed suggested CDL frameworks for language teaching. When \ntallied (see Appendix A) against the three major domains of ESD, 16 studies provided CDL \nframeworks that focused on the development of competencies in the ESD cognitive domain that \nfosters Systems thinking, Normative, and Critical thinking competencies. Systems thinking \npedagogy primarily focused on encouraging students to examine the interplay between the \nvisual, semiotic, and semantic in texts (Nguyen, Chambers, & Abbo tt, 2022; Schildhauer, Gerlach \n& Weiser -Zurmühlen, 2023; Blume, 2022; Barnes & Tour, 2023; Molin & Godhe, 2020), the \nstructural manipulations in texts that shape meaning (Valdez, Ugalingan & Garinto, 2022) and \nthe contextual influences on texts (Tour, Gindidis. & Newton, 2021; Mustifa & Lestari, 2023; \nKhasbani, 2018; Heafner, Triplett, Handler, & Massey, 2018). Normative thinking competencies \npromoted by these studies include the ability to question assumptions and beliefs that inform \ntexts (Valdez, Ugalingan & Garinto, 2022 ), examine the power dynamics implied in the way texts \ngive or suppress voices and promote biases (Schildhauer, Gerlach & Weiser -Zurmühlen, 2023; \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 6  \n \n \nO’Byrne, Crandall,  Dail, Goering, Mora, Price -Dennis, & Witte, 2022), and also examine the \nideological, political, and individual contexts that situate the structure, information, and \nintention of texts (Janusz, 2022; Molin & Godhe, 2020; Khasbani, 2018; Ostenson & Silva, 2019). \nCritical thinking competencies suggested in these CDL frameworks insist on familiarizing \nstudents with multimodal texts in the contexts of both production and reception (Kustini, \nSuherdi,  & Musthafa, 2020; Reinhardt & Thorne, 2019; Mustifa & Lestari, 2023; Molin & Godhe, \n2020), empowering learners to identify and filter the nature of information obtained from online \nmedium (Nguyen, Chambers, & Abbott, 2022; Ostenson & Silva, 2019), and developing their \nabilities to analyse and evaluate factual (Schildhauer, Gerlach & Weiser -Zurmühlen, 2023), \nrhetorical (Khasbani, 2018; Heafner, Triplett, Handler, & Massey, 2018; Molin & Godhe, 2020; \nJanusz, 2022), structural (Valdez, Ugalingan & Garinto, 2022), and metacognitive (Lazou & \nTsinakos, 2023) aspects of texts and the meaning-making process.  Molin & Godhe’s (2020) \nempirical research is a representative sample of comprehensive pedagogy focusing on the \ndevelopment of Systems thinking, Normative, and Critical thinking competencies using CDL \nframework. The authors situate their study in a Swedish language lesson. Students were \nexpected to deconstruct a video clip following a five resources model of CDL (Hinrichsen & \nCoombs, 2014 as cited in Molin & Godhe, 2020, pp. 154 -155) including practices such as \nbreaking codes, meaning -making, using texts functionally, analysing texts, and persona. They \nensured that the video clip was chosen from the students’ lived experience since this is an \nessential aspect of the five resources model. Students then watched the entire video clip and \nengaged in small group activity discussing the perspectives in terms of the content, the creator’s \nintentions, the prominent voices in the clip, the perspectives hidden in the video, and the \ncontext of reception of the video clip. It could be noted that the discussion activity enabled \nstudents to examine to some extent the visual, semiotic and semantic relations in the text and \nalso explore the contextual implications thus engaging students in Systems thinking. The \nexploration of the creator’s intentions and the dominant and hidden voices promoted \nNormative competency. Critical thinking was an inherent skill exercised during these activities \nsince all discussions were based on the analysis and evaluation of the content design, hidden \nassumptions and intentions, and the students’ interpretation of the video clip. The authors \ncontend that including digital multimodal texts positively impacts the critical awareness of the \ntexts and their contexts. \nSix of the 17 studies examined, explicitly included strategies to transfer competencies that \nmatched the ones in the ESD affective domain. Nguyen, Chambers, & Abbott (2022) proposed \nthat language classes should be venues for learners to manage their own online identities while \ndeveloping intercultural understanding and keeping an open mind to multiple perspectives from \nacross the virtual world. Reinhardt & Thorne (2019) agree to the identity-building opportunity \nprovided by CDL and add that the teaching strategies should also focus developing skills of self-\nregulation when engaging in online communication. Lazou & Tsinakos (2023) explore the \nadvantages of collaborative content creation that encourages interpersonal and intercultural \nunderstanding. They also include a final component of reflective content creation at the end of \ntheir lessons to enable students to develop awareness about their learning process, choices, and \nlearning. Reinhardt & Thorne (2019), Blume (2022), Nguyen, Chambers, & Abbott (2022), Valdez, \nUgalingan & Garinto (2022) and Mustifa & Lestari, (2023) also recommend taking advantage of \nJoseph, S. | Page 7  \n \n \nthe possibilities offered by the participatory nature of language learning immersed in digital \ntechnology to collaboratively question the norms dictating the use of language in the \nproduction and reception of texts. The authors reinforced the need to collaboratively explore \nperspectives and narratives that shape realities. Lazou & Tsinakos’ (2023) study is an empirical \nexploration of the use of Augmented Reality (AR) applications incorporated into the Content \nand Language Integrated Learning. Conducted in a transnational English as Foreign Language \nsetting, the researchers developed AR-based learning materials to enable students to develop \nsubject knowledge, learning, thinking and creative abilities, communication skills, and \nintercultural understanding.  The focus on developing Collaborative competency was built into \nthe collaborative content creation activity that the researchers had designed. The activity \nrequired students to teach and learn from one another, work as a team, and participate in group \ndecision-making and negotiation. The researchers observed that the collaborative learning \nprocess had a significant impact on the students’ intercultural understanding. The researchers \nalso required students to make a reflective film at the end of the course, where the students had \nto reflect on how they learned, the challenges they faced, the choices they made, and their \noverall learning. This exercise in reflection mediated by digital technology was a fruitful exercise \nfor students applying their awareness about the nature, advantages and limitations of the digital \ntext. \nThe most action-oriented competencies posited by ESD Conative domain are the Anticipatory, \nStrategic, and Integrated problem-solving competencies. Eight studies propose CDL frameworks \nthat promote action -oriented pedagogy in language teaching.  Kustini, Suherdi,  & Musthafa, \n(2020), Nguyen, Chambers, & Abbott, (2022) and Novianti, Thomas  & To, (2021) adopted the \ncall to design and redesign using multiliteracies (Vasquez, Janks & Comber, 2019) in order to \nformulate a transformative pedagogy. By redesign, the authors required learners to use \nmultimodal digital technologies to rework the dynamics of power, equity, and voice to shape \nmore inclusive, just and equitable realities. Though not directing referring to principles of \nredesign, Schildhauer, Gerlach & Weiser -Zurmühlen, (2023), Lazou & Tsinakos, (2023), Valdez, \nUgalingan & Garinto, (2022), O’Byrne, Crandall,  Dail, Goering, Mora, Price -Dennis, & Witte, \n(2022) and Barnes & Tour, (2023) use CDL frameworks to assert the need for learners to act \nthrough expository discourses, open -minded discussions, interrogative explorations, and \ncreative actions that promote social justice and understanding. Kustini, Suherdi,  & Musthafa’s \n(2020) study situated in an English for Specific Purposes classroom provides an empirically \ntested strategy to develop Anticipatory and Strategic competencies in students. Students were \ntasked to collaboratively create an ‘e -MiniMagz’, a magazine-like image text using multiple \nmodes on a given topic. Second, students were also required to individually create a video \npresentation, a digital multimodal expository text. Clearly, the individual task developed \nstudents’ anticipatory and strategic competencies to address issues of significance in real world \nthrough an examination of the issue and exploring possible solutions.   \nTaken together the CDL frameworks in the 17 studies are unequivocal about the feasibility of \nlanguage classes as spaces for cognitive development, emotional maturation, and change-\noriented action when integrating digital technologies. Empirical studies examined showed that \nCDL frameworks promoted not only language acquisition and proficiency development but also \nenabled the development of the key competencies for sustainable development. Examined in \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 8  \n \n \nlight of the premises of Education for Sustainable Development, the pedagogical proposals in \nthese studies have the potential to be adapted and adopted for significant revolutions in the \ndigital world. \n \nDiscussion \nThe results of the integrative review inform the proposed framework for Critical AI Literacy. \nLanguage teachers could use the latest in the Large Language Model Generative Pre -trained \nTransformers to generate texts when integrating the CAIL framework. CAIL framework (Figure 2) \nwill be an organic evolution of the CDL frameworks for language teaching synthesized using the \nESD domains. The much-discussed innovative edge of LLMs like GPTs is in their ability to reason \nlike humans (Huang & Chang, 2023). However, this apparent ability to reason like humans is also \na cause for concern since developers and researchers are unable to confirm if these models are \nactually reasoning like humans or generating reasoning-like responses (Huang & Chang, 2023;  \nKasneci et al., 2023). In English language classes, the CAIL framework applied to texts generated \nby LLMs could enable learners to understand and be mindful of this uncertainty.  \nThe CAIL framework is founded on the cognitive, affective and conative ESD domains that \nincorporate the development of the eight key competencies essential to achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. The framework builds on the main pedagogical strategies identified in the \nreview of CDL frameworks for English language classes. In the cognitive domain of CAIL, learners \nwould hone their Systems thinking, Normative, and Critical thinking competencies. To develop \nthe Systems thinking competency, learners shou ld examine the apparent reasoning used in the \ngenerated text, identify the contextual implications of the reasoning, and examine how the text \ntype and its conventions inform the nature of the generated text. This should be followed by \nimmersion in Normative competency strategies like identifying the values, beliefs, and \nideologies in which the generated text is situated, examining one’s own ideological stance, belief \nsystems and values that are brought to the interpretation of the text, examining the voices  \nheard and suppressed in the text. Critical thinking competency is something that learners will \nengage in during the entire exercise. Learners will verify facts used in the generative texts, \nanalyse the structure and components of the arguments in the generative text, and evaluate the \nmeaning and message in the digital and real world contexts. The learners will now be ready to \nmove into the affective domain of the framework where they will fine-tune their Collaborative \nand Self -awareness competencies. Learn ers should discuss with in-class and virtual peers the \nperspectives on the generated text. They should use multiple modes of interacting with virtual \npeers. They should then examine how the mode of communication with peers affects the \nproduction and interpretation of perspectives. These strategies will help learners develop \nCollaborative competency which should be simultaneously developed along with the Self -\nawareness competency. To engage in self-reflection, learners should follow the codes for the \nchosen mode of communication when presenting one’s perspective. They should examine how \nthe mode of communication affects the production and interpretation of their own perspectives. \nThe learners will then move into the final phase of the CAIL framework that addresses the \nconative domain including Anticipatory, Strategic and Integrated problem -solving \ncompetencies. To develop anticipatory competency, learners will engage in a reflective planning \nJoseph, S. | Page 9  \n \n \nprocess. They will plan to redesign LLM-generated text by identifying the assumptions and \npower dynamics that influence the text. They should also verify facts that will be used in the \nredesigned text. They should then both individually and collaboratively brainstorm how the \nredesigned text could represent the power dynamics and ideological positions in an inclusive \nand just manner. Learners should then identify and use multiple modes of production to \ngenerate redesigned text. With that , they will engage their Strategic competency. During this \nstage, they should also ensure that local contextual considerations are factored into the \nredesign. If the text type permits, learners should ensure that the redesigned text is expository, \nanalytical, and self -evaluative in nature. For the CAIL to effectively contribute to ESD, the final \nstage of Integrated problem -solving is crucial. Learners should use the redesigned texts in real \nworld contexts to address issues of local and global significance. They should consciously ensure \nthat values of inclusion, social justice, and collaboration inform the redesigned text. Moreover, \nlearners should iteratively evaluate redesigned texts for sustainability indicators and go back to \nthe drawing board for constant refinement. Language teachers are advised to repeatedly use the \nCAIL framework throughout the academic year to empower learners to contribute to the \nachievement of SDGs. \n \nFigure 2: Critical AI Literacy (CAIL) framework \n \nSample application of CAIL to a generative text \nTo exemplify the application of CAIL in the context of language teaching, the researcher used \nOpenAI’s ChatGPT-3 to prompt the model to generate text on the analysis of the poem, ‘The \n\nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 10  \n \n \nTraitress’ by the Indian poet, Meena Kandasamy. The following prompt was used by the \nresearcher: Write an essay on the use of allusion in Meena Kandasamy's poem \"Traitress\". The \nprompt was deliberately made specific to avoid ambiguities that might affect the response \ngenerated. The ChatGPT -3 generated response (Figure 3 ) is then analysed using the CAIL \nframework, to show how the framework enables the development of the  key competencies for \nESD. \n \nFigure 3: ChatGPT-3 generated response to the sample prompt \nTitle: The Multilayered Significance of Allusion in Meena Kandasamy's Poem \"Traitress\"  \nIntroduction \nMeena Kandasamy, a contemporary Indian poet, is known for her powerful and thought -provoking \npoems that delve into issues of social justice, identity, and feminism. Her poem \"Traitress\" is \na compelling example of her use of allusion to convey layered meanings and engage the reader in \na complex dialogue. In this essay, we will explore how Kandasamy employs allusion in \"Traitress\" \nto evoke historical and cultural references, creating a rich tapestry of meaning and challenging \nconventional narratives. \nHistorical Allusions \nOne of the primary functions of allusion in \"Traitress\" is to draw upon historical references, \nthereby enriching the poem's thematic depth. Kandasamy subtly references figures and events from \nhistory to shed light on contemporary issues. For instance, she alludes to Draupadi, a character \nfrom the Indian epic Mahabharata, who is known for her resilience and resistance against \noppression. By invoking Draupadi's name, Kandasamy highlights the enduring struggle of women \nagainst patriarchal systems, making a connection between anc ient mythology and contemporary \nfeminist movements. \nAdditionally, the poem alludes to the historical figure of Joan of Arc, the French heroine who \ndefied societal norms and led her country in battle. By referencing Joan of Arc, Kandasamy \nunderscores the co urage and determination of women who have challenged established power \nstructures throughout history. This allusion serves to empower and inspire readers to recognize \nand confront contemporary injustices. \nCultural Allusions \nIn \"Traitress,\" Kandasamy also u tilizes cultural allusions to provide insight into the \ncomplexities of identity and heritage. She mentions \"the bitter turmeric of betrayal,\" a \nreference to the significance of turmeric in Indian culture, which is often used in ceremonies \nand rituals. By i nvoking this cultural symbol, Kandasamy highlights the profound impact of \nbetrayal within the context of one's cultural heritage, suggesting that acts of betrayal can \ncarry significant cultural and personal consequences. \nFurthermore, the poem refers to the \"mythical border of decency,\" which serves as an allusion to \nthe boundaries and norms that societies impose upon individuals, especially women. This allusion \ninvites readers to question and challenge these societal expectations, encouraging them to break \nfree from the confines of tradition and embrace their authentic selves. \nChallenging Conventional Narratives \nKandasamy's use of allusion in \"Traitress\" goes beyond mere references to historical and \ncultural figures; it challenges and subverts conventional n arratives. By reimagining these \nfigures in a contemporary context, she disrupts traditional interpretations and encourages \nreaders to reconsider established viewpoints. The use of Draupadi and Joan of Arc as symbols of \nresistance and defiance against oppre ssion challenges the idea that women should conform to \nsocietal norms without question. \nMoreover, the poem's title, \"Traitress,\" itself carries an allusion to the label often placed on \nindividuals who deviate from societal expectations or betray the status  quo. Kandasamy subverts \nthis label, suggesting that being a \"traitress\" can be an act of courage and liberation rather \nthan betrayal. \nConclusion \nMeena Kandasamy's \"Traitress\" is a profound exploration of the use of allusion to convey complex \nhistorical, cultural, and feminist themes. By drawing upon references from history and culture, \nKandasamy creates a multi-layered narrative that challenges conventional narratives and invites \nreaders to reflect on issues of identity, resistance, and empowerment. Through her skillful use \nof allusion, she transforms these references into powerful tools for social critique and \ncommentary, making \"Traitress\" a compelling and thought-provoking work of poetry. (OpenAI, 2023) \nJoseph, S. | Page 11  \n \n \nAnalysis of ChatGPT-3 generated response \nSystems thinking competency \n1. Examine the apparent reasoning used in the generated text : The reasoning in the \nintroduction that connects the poem to the themes of justice, identity and feminism is \nconvincing even on a cursory reading of the poem.  \n2. Identify the contextual implications of the reasoning : However, the rest of the introductory \nparagraph includes sweeping statements that do not contextualize or locate the response in the \nactual text of the poem. For instance, the themes of representation, identity, and the subaltern \nare not identified by the model. \n3. Examine how the text type and its conventions inform the nature of the generated text : The \nprompt requires the model to generate an essay and the response clearly uses the conventions \nof an essay structure including an introduction, thematically organized body paragraphs, and a \nconclusion. Being a literary essay, the model also uses what appears to be quotes from the \npoem to develop a point. \nNormative competency \n1. Identify the values, beliefs, and ideologies in which the generated text is situated : By using \nphrases and words like ‘the patriarchal systems’, ‘power structures’, ‘injustices’, ‘betrayal’, \n‘boundaries’, and ‘norms’ in the analysis, the response seems to situate itself in feminist critical \ntraditions.  \n2. Examine one’s ideological stance, belief systems , and values that are brought to the \ninterpretation of the text : The researcher’s ideological understanding of historicity, feminist \nidentity, Dalit poetics, and subversive literature informs the interpretation of both the poem and \nthe response generated by ChatGPT-3. \n3. Examine the voices heard and suppressed in the text : Though the response seems to identify \nwith the narrative voice in the poem, the factual errors and the lack of depth in the analysis \nsuggest that the generated response does not highlight any voice. \nCritical thinking competency \n1. Verify facts used in the generative texts : The generated text claims that the historical allusion \nin the poem is to Draupadi, a character in the Indian epic, The Mahabharata and to Joan of Arc, \nthe historical figure and patron saint of France. However, both allusions are factually wrong. The \nallusion in Kandasamy’s poem is to Shoorpanaka, a character in the Indian epic, The Ramayana. \nThough there is no direct allusion to Joan of Arc, one could argue that Shoorpanaka’s \nassociation in the political future of her nation makes her comparable to the historical figure. \nMoreover, all the apparent quotes from the poem are erroneous. These quotes seem fabricated \nby the model. The discussion of the cultural allusion to turmeric and its association with betrayal \nis not factually verifiable. The model seems to have syllogistically connected the significance of \nturmeric in the Indian culture to the feminist theme of betrayal because the two seem to occur \nin similar contexts. \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 12  \n \n \n2. Analyse the structure and components of the arguments in the generative text : The model \nuses the argument, evidence, explanation, and evaluation structure in all the body paragraphs.  \n3. Evaluate the meaning and message in the digital and real world contexts : If the factual errors \nwere overlooked, the response seems to be superficially discussing a relevant message about \nthe poem, that is , the call to disrupt and subvert the traditional narratives and encourage \nreaders to perceive social and cultural narratives of women from a new perspective. The \nmeaning conveyed by the generated text, however, is superficial and factually incorrect. \nCollaborative competency \n1. Discuss with in-class and virtual peers the perspectives on the generated text : Use multiple \nmodes of interacting with virtual peers. The researcher would recommend engaging in a close \nreading of the text in small groups within the class. One could also communicate with the \nauthor, Meena Kandasamy, using digital multimodalities and engage in a conversation about \nthe poem. The researcher and students could also engage in conversation with or explore the \ninterpretations provided by other readers, commentators, and reviewers of the poem including \nthose available in academically published papers.  \n2. Examine how the mode of communication with peers affects the production and \ninterpretation of perspectives: The researcher and students could examine the difference in the \nperspectives they come across when using formal and informal means of digital multimodal \ncommunication. For example, the perspective exchanged over a video chat might be \nsignificantly different from those expressed in an email since most people perceive email as a \nwritten record. \nSelf-awareness competency \n1. When presenting one’s perspectives, follow the codes for the mode of communication : The \nresearcher along with the students could explore the codes for multimodalities of digital \ncommunication and maintain a checklist to ensure that the codes are adhered to. \n2. Examine how the mode of communication affects the production and interpretation of one’s \nperspectives: Entries in a self-reflection journal of the entire process would enable the researcher \nand students to note how the mode of communication changed the way they produced \ninterpretative texts and shared perspectives. \nAnticipatory competency \n1. Plan a redesign of the generated text : The plan would be to ensure factual correctness, in-\ndepth analysis and theoretical grounding of the response. \n2. Identify assumptions and power dynamics that one should be cognizant of : The theoretical \ngrounding in Dalit poetics, feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytical, or New criticism should help \nidentify the power dynamics implicit in the poem \n3. Verify facts that will be used in the redesigned text : This would entail a detailed examination \nof facts using various reliable sources in multiple modes.  \nJoseph, S. | Page 13  \n \n \n4. Brainstorm how the redesigned text could represent the power dynamics and ideological \npositions in an inclusive and just manner : A mapping of the redesigned response would help to \ncollate all the information gathered. \nStrategic competency \n1. Use multiple modes of production to generate redesigned text : The researcher and students \ncould individually generate their responses to the prompt using digital multimodalities and then \npeer evaluate the responses. Moreover, the researcher could explore multiple variations of the \nprompt to feed the model with information that could revise the generated response more \ncomprehensively. \n2. Ensure that local contextual considerations are factored into the redesign: An exploration into \nthe local context of Dalit poetics would enable readers to understand the sociocultural and \npolitical underpinnings of the poem.  \n3. If the text type permits, ensure that the redesigned text is expository, analytical, and self -\nevaluative in nature: The response to the use of allusions in Kandasamy’s poem will invariably be \nexpository in nature since the text is an act of subversion giving voice to the marginalized and \nthe disenfranchised. \nIntegrated problem-solving competency \n1. Use the redesigned texts in real world contexts to address issues of local and global \nsignificance: The researcher would recommend collaborating with organizations that develop, \ntrain, and fine-tune LLMs to provide them with datasets that are more inclusive in nature.  \n2. Values of inclusion, social justice, and collaboration should inform the redesigned text : The \nredesigned response could be responsibly shared with stakeholders to initiate and engage in \ndiscussions and actions on the issues represented in the poem. \n3. Evaluate redesigned texts for sustainability indicators and go back to the drawing board for \nconstant refinement: All discussions and actions should be accompanied by an individual and \ncollaborative reflective exercise to identify the gaps and bridge them. \nConclusion \nThis integrative review is a foundational activity that addresses the urgent need to incorporate \nAI and its language models. By situating the study in the English language classes, the research \ncontextualizes the nature of the pedagogy in terms of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a fast \nadvancing AI technology. The transformative potential of the proposed CAIL framework is \nimmense if teachers and students were to engage in using sustainable cognitive structures in \nlanguage use to understand, analyse, eval uate, and solve issues of local and global proportions. \nCAIL would empower individuals to effectively use technological advancements in AI to promote \ndiscourses and create narratives that are just, inclusive, and equitable in nature. The CAIL \nframework proposed in this study is a theoretical notion and therefore, needs empirical testing \nin diverse local conditions to understand its real life implications. Future research could also \nfocus further on the integrative approach adopted by this paper, where the C DL discourse is \nsynthesized with the ESD competencies. The participatory, social justice and action-oriented \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 14  \n \n \nCAIL pedagogy in language teaching is the need of the hour if human intelligence and artificial \nintelligence is to coexist in a sustainable space. \n \nDeclaration of Conflicts of Interests \nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest. \nFunding Disclosure/Acknowledgement \nThe author declared that no funding has been received for the research or/and publication. \n \nReferences  \nBacalja, A., Aguilera, E. & Castrillon-Angel, E.
