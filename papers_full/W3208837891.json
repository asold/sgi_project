INTRODUCTION\nReinforcement learning has revolutionized the way to model\nthe dialogue policy which decides the next action of the dia-\nlogue system suited to the current state [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. On\nthe ﬂip side, one notorious limitation of reinforcement learn-\ning is reward sparsity issue where here the system usually\nreceive a positive (or negative) reward signal when the dia-\nlogue ends successfully (or unsuccessfully). Thus, the reward\nsignal is delayed and sparse, making it extremely difﬁcult to\nconnect a long series of actions to a distant future reward es-\npecially for complex goals across multiple domains [6].\nA typical reward function, for example, often apply a\nminor negative penalty (i.e., -1) in the middle of the ses-\nsion to encourage the system to accomplish the task in fewer\nturns, with a huge positive (i.e., +40) or negative (i.e., -40)\nreward at the end [1]. This kind of global reward based\non (state,action) pairs is not informative and lead to ex-\nploration in large action space inefﬁcient [8]. To get more\n∗Corresponding Author\ndense and enlightening reward signals, most previous works\nrecovers the intrinsic local reward from expert demonstra-\ntions through reward shaping [5, 9]. More speciﬁcally, some\nworks train a discriminator to differentiate (state,action)\ngenerated by dialogue agents from (state,action) by expert\nand then regards the discriminator as a reward estimator to\nprovide intrinsic reward signals, where the dialogue policy\nmodel and discriminator updates alternately on the ﬂy [10, 6].\nA further line of work decomposes the whole training into\ntwo steps by ﬁrstly training the discriminator with an aux-\niliary dialogue generator and secondly incorporating it into\ncommon RL method, since the alternative update mechanism\nlimits the policy model to policy-gradient-based algorithms\n[7]. However, the vast bulk of annotated(state,action) pairs\nfrom expert demonstration is hard to acquire. Moreover, the\nreward model based on state-action pair might cause unstable\npolicy learning and affect optimization speed with the limited\namount of annotated dialogues [11].\nOur work keeps in line with the methods to decompose the\nwhole training into two sequential steps. We incorporate the\npretrained language model as the reward model into common\nRL method to provide denselocal rewardsignals, guiding the\naction decision of dialogue policy learning. Speciﬁcally, we\nre-formulate one of the pre-training sub-tasks of BERT Next\nSentence Prediction as Next Action Predictionat the ﬁrst step.\nGiven current user action au, the classiﬁer will distinguish\nwhether or not the response system action as is suitable or\nacceptable. Intuitively, if the system chooses the right action\nto answer user’s query at each turn, then the dialogue natu-\nrally succeeds at the end. Secondly, the trained classiﬁer as\nthe dialogue reward model will be incorporated into the RL\nprocess to guide the dialogue policy learning without updates.\nThere are several advantages of our proposed method: 1) Our\nmethod is model-agnostic which can be incorporated in any\nRL algorithm to guide the policy learning, 2) Only action-\npairs demonstration reduce the cost of annotation compared\nwith state-action pairs demonstration, and 3) Pre-trained lan-\nguage model has been proved powerful and transferable in\nmany NLP tasks which can capture the subtle difference of\naction-pairs, providing more dense reward signal at each turn.\nThe main contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) we\npropose a simple yet effective reward estimator at the action-\narXiv:2111.01398v1  [cs.CL]  2 Nov 2021\nlevel to guide the action decision, and 2) We investigate the ef-\nfects of global reward and local reward, and the experimental\nresults on MultiWOZ [12] show that our methods outperform\nsingle global rewardabout 4.4%, and furthermore, almost 8%\nwhen combined with global reward, which indicates the com-\nplementary effects of these two types of reward.\n2. RELATED WORK\nThe ﬁrst focus of reward shaping is recovering the intrin-\nsic local reward from expert demonstration by inverse rein-\nforcement learning or adversarial training. Peng et al. [10]\nproposed an adversarial advantage actor-critic (Adversarial\nA2C) method based on (state,action) pairs from simu-\nlation and expert demonstration. Similarly, Takanobu et\nal. [6] utilizes Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning\nto jointly estimate reward and optimize dialogue policy in\nmulti-domain task-oriented dialog. Wang et al. [8] directly\nestimate potential-based reward function from demonstra-\ntions. Nevertheless, methods alternately learning the reward\nmodel and policy cannot be extended to off-policy methods\nwhich beneﬁt from self-learned reward functions [7].\nThe second focus of reward shaping is to train reward\nmodel and dialogue policy consecutively, rather than alterna-\ntively as mentioned above [7]. Li et al. [7] appropriate the\nreward model with multilayer perceptron (MLP) to train a\ndiscriminator based on (state,action) pairs. Besides that,\nGabriel et al. [13] propose a No Label Expert (NLE) that uses\nan unannotated dialog dataset consisting of pairs of sentences\n(su,ss), representing user utterances and the corresponding\nagent responses, guiding the dialogue policy. Distinguishing\nfrom these works, we tackle reward sparsity by incorporat-\ning pretrained language model as a reward estimator and train\na discriminator at action-level rather than sentence-level or\n(state,action) pairs.\n3. METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we ﬁrstly introduce the detail of next ac-\ntion prediction (namely, how to train the discriminator), and\nthen presents an algorithm that incorporates the reward signal\ngiven in the ﬁrst step (namely, how to update the dialogue pol-\nicy). Figure 1 shows the overall framework of our proposed\nmethod.\n3.1. Next Action Prediction\nNext Sentence Prediction is one of pre-trained task in BERT,\naiming to predict whether, for a given pair of sentences\n(s1,s2), s2 is an next sentence to s1. Similarly, Next Action\nPrediction task is to determine whether or not the current\nsystem action as is an appropriate response to the last user\naction au in dialogue. An action (i.e., au and as) consists of\n[CLS]HotelInform{area=don’tcare;choice=any}[SEP]HotelInform{area=east;name=starwars}[SEP]\nSystemactionUseraction\nSigmoidlayerPolicyLearning\nUserSimulator𝑠LocalDenseReward ExpertDemo\nDialogueStateTracking𝑎!,𝑟\n𝑎\"\n𝑠\n… …BERT[CLS]\nFig. 1.

In this case, we represent the action as:\nau = [A1\nu,A2\nu,..., An\nu] as = [A1\ns,A2\ns,..., An\ns] (2)\nThen, we concatenate the user action au and system ac-\ntion as and feed it into BERT. Two special tokens[CLS] and\n[SEP] are added to indicate the start and separation of ac-\ntions respectively. The input representations consist of token\nembedding, segment embedding and positional embedding.\nH = BERT(emb(au,as)) (3)\nThe embedding of ﬁrst token (i.e. [CLS]) then is then feed\ninto a sigmoid layer to do classiﬁcation as deﬁned:\nf(x) = sigmoid(Wh1 + b) (4)\nThe ﬁnal output of the binary classiﬁer f(x) is a probabil-\nity that indicates the conﬁdent score that the system action is\nsuitable and appreciate given last user action. The objective\nof the classiﬁer Dφ can be represented as follows:\nLD = E(log(1−Dφ(au,as)sim))−E(Dφ(au,as)real) (5)\nAfter the discriminator is trained, we will keep it as the\nreward function for future dialogue policy learning without\nupdates, which is illustrated at later section.\n3.2. PPO-OFF\nA trajectory (s0,a0,s1,a1,...) is generated by sampling ac-\ntions according to the policy at ∼ π(at|st) consecutively,\nuntil the terminal states is reached. Here, the action at can be\nfurther divided into the user actionau and system action as in\ndialogue. A reward signal rt is received at each time step.\nT = [(s0,(au,as),r0,s1),..., (sn,(au,as),rn,sn+1)] (6)\nwhere st,au,as,rt,st+1 represents the dialogue state,\nuser action, system action, reward and next state at time step\nt respectively. The main objective of agent is to maximize\nthe cumulative reward R = ∑T\n0 γtrt, where γ is a discount\nfactor. Given the objective function, the gradient can be\ncomputed as follows:\ng= E[\nT∑\n0\nΨt∇θlogπθ(at|st)] (7)\nwhere Ψt can be estimated with different methods. We\nadapt generalized advantage function Aπ(st,at) here as fol-\nlows 1:\nAGAE(γ,λ)\nt =\n∞∑\nl=0\n(γλ)lδV\nt+l (8)\nwhere δV\nt = −V(st) + rt + γV(St+1). Both γ and λ\nplays key roles in the bias-variance trade-off and serve differ-\nent purposes when using an approximate value function. To\nstabilize the policy updates, we adapt the clipped surrogate\nobjective as follows [15].\nLCLIP = E[min(rt(θ)AGAE\nt ,clip(rt(θ),1−σ,1+σ)AGAE\nt )]\n(9)\nwhere rt(θ) = πθ(at|st)\nπθold(at|st) . In addition to policy, we also\nparametrize the value function and add entropy bonus to en-\nsure sufﬁcient exploration[15]. The whole training objective\nis deﬁned as follows:\nLCLIP+VF +S = E[LCLIP −c1 ∗LVF +c2 ∗S[π](s)] (10)\nwhere c1,c2 are coefﬁcients, and S denotes an entropy\nbonus, and LVF is a squared-error loss (Vθ(st) −Vtar\nt )2.\nIt is obvious that the reward model plays a key role in di-\nalogue policy learning since it directly affect the training ob-\njective. To investigate the effects of different reward signals,\nwe replace the rt in the trajectory with three different types of\nreward: global reward, local reward and combination.\nFor global reward, we simply assign it a large positive\n(v.s. negative) reward +40 (v.s. -40) when the dialogue ends\nsuccessfully (v.s. unsuccessfully), while -1 during the middle\nof session to encourage shorter session. For local reward,\nwe remap the output conﬁdent score to a range of [-1, 1] as\nfollows, aiming to encourage the policy to decide more high\nqualiﬁed actions.\nrlocal = −1+2 ∗Dφ(au,as) rcomb = rglobal+rlocal (11)\n1at refers the system action as while au is decided by a user simulator\n4. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS\n4.1. Dataset and Evaluation Metric\nAll models are evaluated on MultiWOZ [12], a multi-domain,\nmulti-intent task-oriented dialog corpus that contains 7 do-\nmains, 13 intents, 25 different slots and 10483 dialog ses-\nsions. We report the average number of dialog turns, averag-\ning over successful dialog sessions and all dialog sessions re-\nspectively, to measure the efﬁcient of accomplishing a task. A\ndialog turn consists of a user utterance and a subsequent sys-\ntem (i.e. utterance pairs). Precision, recall and F1 are calcu-\nlated based on dialog acts (i.e. action pairs) [16]. Match rate\nassesses whether the offered entity meets all the constraints\nspeciﬁed in a user goal. The dialog is marked as successful if\nand only if both inform recall and match rate are 1.\n4.2. Baselines\nMLE: One of representative work of supervised learning to\nlearn dialogue policy, which employs a multi-class classiﬁca-\ntion via imitation learning (i.e., behavioral cloning) with a set\nof compositional actions where a compositional action con-\nsists of a set of dialog act items.\nGDPL: [6] A method which alternatively updates dialogue\npolicy and reward estimation model by using adversarial in-\nverse reinforcement learning. It is noted that reward estimator\nrecovers the reward signal form the state-action pairs at each\ndialogue turn.\nPPO [15] A policy-based reinforcement learning method\nwhich uses multiple epochs of stochastic gradient ascent and\na constant clipping mechanism the soft constraint to perform\neach policy update.

Similarly, PPO-OFF-Local only\nreceives local dense reward from pre-trained language model\n(i.e., BERT) and PPO-OFF-Global receives only global re-\nward respectively.\n4.3. Implementation Details\nFor next action prediction, we ﬁrstly build the binary classi-\nﬁcation dataset from MultiWoZ [12] automatically and get\n99370, 13157, 13073 labeled samples for training, testing\nand validation respectively 2. And then we use BERT[17]\nas backbone and Adamas optimization algorithm. The spe-\nciﬁc hyper-parameters are deployed as follows: batch size as\n4, learning rate as 5e-5, epochs as 10, adam epsilon as 1e-8,\nthe max sequence length as 512 3.\n2We sample user action au with system action as from same dialogue\nas positive sample, and randomly sample another system action from other\ndialogue to form negative sample.\n3It is noted that the trained BERT model achieved 97.34% accuracy at\nthe binary classiﬁcation task, which proves the pre-trained language model is\nModel Agenda\nPrecision/Recall/F1 Match Success\nHuman 81.9/93.4/85.3 92.1 82.7\nMLE 63.1/72.6/64.5 50.1 47.0\nGDPL 63.1/73.0/64.6 50.0 47.2\nPPO 64.4/78.3/68.2 64.7 61.2\nPPO-OFF-Global 63.0/81.2/67.8 70.8 63.2\nPPO-OFF-Local 60.9/82.9/67.4 70.9 67.6\nPPO-OFF-Comb 67.2/85.7/72.7 79.6 71.4\nTable 1.

In this case, other components in\ntask-oriented dialogue system are BERTNLU, RuleDST and\nTemplate-based NLG. More speciﬁcally, we set the maximum\nturn of one conversation as 20, which means the dialogue will\nbe terminated and regarded as failure when the turn excesses\n20. We sample 1024 trajactories each epoch and the max\nepoch is set as 200. Other hyper-parameter settings follows\nTakanobu et al. [6].\n4.4. Main Result\nTable 1 demonstrates the performance of different methods\non the MultiWoZ dataset [12]. Consistent with intuition, the\ncombination (i.e., PPO-OFF-Comb) of global and local re-\nward reaches highest performance in both match rate (9% im-\nprovement) and success rate (8% improvement). Besides that,\nPPO-OFF-Local achieves comparable match rate but much\nhigher success rate compared with PPO-OFF-Global. We at-\ntribute this to more semantic frame are correct in the dialogue\nsince success rate is much harder to improve than match rate.\nCompared with previous methods such as PPO, our proposed\nmethods demonstrate superior performance by improving al-\nmost 10%.\nFig. 2.

Analysis\nWe also conduct evaluation at the action-level (i.e., without\nNLU and NLG part) to learn the converge speed and perfor-\nmance under different domains respectively.\nConverge SpeedThe learning curves under different reward\ntypes are presented in Fig 2. We can see that the comb re-\nward converge faster than only local and only global reward,\nleading to higher performance. Besides, the error band of\ncomb reward is dramatically smaller than the other two re-\nwards which indicates more stable policy learning. Therefore,\nwe conclude that local reward signals serve as a complement\nof global reward to better guide and stabilize the behavior of\ndialogue policy.\nThe Effects of Different DomainsWe also report the F1\nscore of different domains with policy learned from differ-\nent rewards as shown in Fig 3. The comb reward consistently\noutperforms single global or local reward signals, especially\nat the hotel, restaurant, taxi and hospital domain. We empha-\nsize that the hotel domain contains the most slots (i.e., 14 dif-\nferent slots) which have the biggest improvement over such\na large action space. However, we noticed that there still a\nlarge gap between different domains. We conjecture this to\nthe data distribution of the original dataset and the difﬁculty\nand complexity of different domains.\n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we integrates pre-trained language model (i.e.\nBERT) as a reward model to provide local reward that com-\nplements with global reward, guiding the dialogue policy\nlearning. The experimental results demonstrate the com-\nbination of global reward and local reward reaches highest\nperformance compares with only global or only local reward.\nWe left more investigation such as pretraining in future work.\n6.
