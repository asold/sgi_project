In\nlower secondary grades, functions mainly have an operational character\nand are seen as an input–output ‘machine’that process input values into\noutput values. In higher grades, functions have a more structural character\nwith various properties (Sfard,1991). They become mathematical objects\nthat are represented in different ways, are ordered into different types\naccording to their properties, and are submitted to higher-order processes\nsuch as differentiation and integration. We argue that the transition from\nfunctions as calculation operations to functions as objects is fundamental\nfor conceptual understanding in this domain.\nCan computer tools help here? Computer tools offer opportunities for\nthinking and learning as they can mediate the learning activities in which\nstudents engage (Sfard & McClain,2002). The availability of sophisti-\ncated tools for mathematics education, however, also raises questions.\nInternational Journal of Science and Mathematics Education (2012) 10: 1243Y1267\n# The Author(s) 2012. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nRepresentations and techniques in such computer environments often\nsignify mathematical concepts that are still to be constructed in students’\nminds. This inherent circularity is known as the learning paradox\n(Bereiter, 1985; Gravemeijer et al.,2002; Heuvel-Panhuizen, 2003). The\nchallenge, therefore, is to avoid these pitfalls and to integrate the use of\ncomputer tools in such a way that it fosters the learning of the concept of\nfunction.\nThe above is summarized in the research question of this study:How\ncan a learning arrangement with computer tools foster the transition\nfrom a procedural calculation understanding to a structural correspon-\ndence and co-variation understanding of functions?\nThe object of study in this report is a newly designed learning\narrangement in which the intertwinement of activities using both paper-\nand-pencil and computer tools, in combination with the careful guidance\nby the teacher, is meant to foster grade 8 students ’ conceptual\ndevelopment of functions. We are particularly interested in activities\nwith computer tools that help students to construct mathematical\nrepresentations and actions, to explore these representations and to start\nreasoning with them (Falcade, Laborde, & Mariotti,2007).\nT\nHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\nWhat theoretical perspectives may help to design and use a learning\narrangement in which the use of computer tools is embedded and which\nfosters the transition from an operational to a structural understanding of\nfunction? First, we need domain-specific knowledge for analyzing the\ncharacter of this transition. Second, from the general background of a\nconstructivist view on learning, the notion of emergent modeling may guide\nthe design. Third, theories on tool use and instrumentation may guide a\ncareful integration of computer tools in the designed learning arrangement.\nThe Concept of Function\nThe teaching and learning of the concept of mathematical function is a\nwidely researched topic. Vinner & Dreyfuss (1989) show that students’\nmental images of functions may be different from its mathematical\ndefinition. Other studies confirm that students’ function conceptions in\nmany cases are limited. For example, Bloch (2003) and Skaja (2003)\nshow that students cannot think of different functions that provide a graph\nthrough the same pair of points. Based on the model by Pirie & Kieren\nMICHIEL DOORMAN ET AL.1244\n(1989), Meel (1998) shows that many of the participants in his study held\na rule-based interpretation of the function concept, which prevents them\nfrom an object-view on the concept, which is needed, among others, for\nthe understanding of the notion of composite function. In their study on\nthe understanding of function, Oehrtman, Carlson & Thompson (2008)\nstress the relevance of students’reasoning abilities and on a conceptual\norientation on the notion of function, which needs time:\nWe advocate for greater emphasis on enculturating students into using the language of\nfunction in order to develop facility in speaking about functions as entities that accept\ninput and produce output, a more conceptual orientation to teaching function inverse and\ncomposition, the inclusion of tasks requiring simultaneous judgements about entire\nintervals of input or output values, and the development of student’s ability to mentally\nrun through a continuum of input value while imagining the changes in the output values,\nwith explicit efforts to also promote, at developmentally appropriate time, the covaria-\ntional reasoning abilities. (Oehrtman, Carlson & Thompson,2008, p. 39).\nIn line with the previous research described above, we want to design a\nlearning arrangement for the topic of function that goes beyond the input–\noutput conception, that provides room for reasoning, and that helps to\novercome a too-limited concept image of function. In order to do so, Sfard’s\ntheory on the dual nature of mathematical conceptions plays a central role and\nis exemplified by the transition from a calculation view to an object view on\nfunction (Sfard,1991). Sfard distinguishes operational and structural concepts,\nthe first concerning mathematical processes and the latter mathematical\nobjects. A function may operationally be seen as a computational process, as a\nrecipe to transform one number into another (or to link one number to\nanother), whereas, structurally, a function can be thought of as a set of ordered\nnumber pairs. The operational and structural conceptions are complementary.\nSfard observes that, historically, the operational aspect preceded the structural\naspect and argues that the same should be the case for the individual learning\nprocess, because the structural approach is more abstract than the operational.\nSimilar dualities are described by Tall (1996) and Dubinsky (1991).\nThis dual nature of function appears difficult for students to\ncomprehend. Most remain entrenched in an operational-based conception\n(Carlson, Jacobs, Coe, Larsen & Hsu, 2002; Breidenbach, Dubinsky,\nHawks & Nichols, 1992). Suggestions have been made to promote\noperational and structural conceptualizations of functions, for example, by\nemphasizing the coordination of the dynamics of input–output dependen-\ncy relationships (Oehrtman et al.,2008; Malle,2000). Various viewpoints\ncan be chosen while analyzing the dynamics, like a correspondence view\nand growth-oriented view (Slavit,1997).\nTOOL USE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 1245\nDifferent function representations afford different views on functions.\nNone of these, however, provides a complete description (Elia, Panaoura,\nEracleous & Gagatsis, 2007). Students will have to coordinate various\nrepresentations to come to get a handle at the phenomena they are\nstudying and to understand the relation between these phenomena and a\ncoherent conception of functions (Duval, 2006; Even, 1998; Janvier,\n1987). To the most common representations, such as verbal descriptions,\ntables, graphs, and formulas, Freudenthal (1983) adds the arrow chain\nrepresentation, in which subsequent operations are chained. He considers\nthe arrow chain as a didactically powerful representation for introducing\nthe operational input–output view.\nThese findings focused us on the transition from operational to\nstructural aspects of functional thinking and on the importance of using\nvarious representations. Based on these findings, our design will be\nguided by the following three interrelated aspects of the function concept:\nY The function as aninput–output assignment\nY The function is an input–output assignment that helps to organize\nand to carry out a calculation process. This initially somewhat vague\nand operational notion gradually gets more nuances: How does the\noutput depend on the input; how does the input determine the output;\nwhat patterns can be seen? The representation of an input –\ncalculation–output chain is appropriate for this view on function.\nY The function as adynamic process of co-variation\nY This aspect concerns the notion that the independent variable,\nwhile running through the domain set, causes the dependent variable\nto run through a range set. The dependent variable co-varies with the\nindependent. Initially, the linked change may be noticed in a\nsomewhat phenomenological way. Next, the question emerges of\nhow and why this process of joint dynamics takes place. Helpful\nrepresentations for studying co-variation are tables and graphs,\nwhich can be scrolled through or traced.\nY The function as amathematical object\nY A function is a mathematical object which can be represented in\ndifferent ways, such as arrow chains, tables, graphs, formulas, and\nphrases, each providing a different view on the same object. The more\nstructural view on functions may be promoted by tasks focusing on a\nglobal level, for example, on families of functions, on function\ncomparison, and later on function differentiation or integration.\nIn terms of Sfard’s process-object duality, the input–output assignment\nview stresses the operational character of functions: It is an action, which\nMICHIEL DOORMAN ET AL.1246\ntakes the input and processes it until it becomes the output. The\nmathematical object view clearly relates to the structural character of\nthe function: It is a ‘thing’, which can be member of a family, or be\nsubmitted to higher-order processes such as differentiation.\nDifferent function representations stress different aspects and uses of\nthe function concept. For example, one single arrow chain is suitable to\nan operational, process view, while a family of graphs is more holistic in\nnature and more suitable to a structural perspective.\nEmergent Modeling\nEmergent modeling is a design heuristic which originated in the frame of the\ntheory of realistic mathematics education (RME) (Gravemeijer1999, 2007).\nRME builds on Freudenthal’s( 1991) image of mathematics as‘ah u m a n\nactivity’: While engaging in mathematics as an activity, students should be\nsupported in reinventing mathematics. The emergent modeling design\nheuristic is a means for organizing such areinvention process. The approach\ntakes its starting point in the activity of modeling contextual problems. In this\nsetup, models initially come to the fore as context-specific models that refer\nto realistic or paradigmatic situations. Then, while the students gather more\nexperience with similar problems, attention may be shifted toward the\nmathematical relations involved. This helps them to further develop those\nmathematical relations, which enables them to use the model in a different\nmanner. The model starts to derive its meaning from these mathematical\nrelations and becomes a base for more formal mathematical reasoning. Or in\nshort: Amodel ofinformal mathematical activity develops into amodel for\nmore formal mathematical reasoning (e.g. Gravemeijer,1999;C o b b ,2002;\nRasmussen & Blumenfeld, 2007; Doorman & Gravemeijer, 2009). The\nlearning paradox, as described in the“Introduction,”can be circumvented by\ndesigning a chain of activities and a process of emergent modeling that\nfosters a reflexive process in which representations and meaning co-evolve\n(Cobb, 2002;M e i r a ,1995). This approach is consistent with conceptual\nchange literature, which argues that students must first explore a domain and\nrecognize limitations or a need for more sophisticated tools, before they are\nready to learn complex concepts (Lehrer & Schauble,2002).\nIn this study, the notion of emergent modeling is used as an important\ndesign heuristic. It stresses the importance of starting with contextual\nproblems that offer opportunities to develop situation-specific reasoning and\ntentative representations for organizing repeated calculations and that have\nthe potential to evoke the need for more sophisticated— mathematical— tools\nand concepts (Gravemeijer,2007). For instance, the table representation is\nTOOL USE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 1247\ninitially understood as a tool for administrating values of two quantities (like\ntime and temperature). In a learning arrangement on functions, the table can\ncome to the fore as a tool for organizing corresponding input–output values\nin contextual problems. Next, on the computer, this table can be used as a\ntool for scrolling and zooming in or out these values for various purposes (e.\ng. analyzing growth behavior or finding break-even points). This imagery—\ntable and actions— initially signifies repeated calculations and emerges into a\nmodel for a structural understanding of dependency relationships. Taking\nthis process seriously asks for a design in which a table tool is not introduced\ntoo quickly, but builds upon previous activities.\nTools and Instrumentation\nEmergent modeling as a design heuristic does not particularly focus on\nthe use of computer tools and the relationship between computer\ntechniques, paper-and-pencil techniques, and conceptual understanding.\nDrawing upon Vygotsky’s views on the dialectic relation between tool\nuse and cultural practices, it is important to understand and carefully plan\nthe role of tools in a learning process (Vygotsky,1986; Wertsch, 1998).\nAs a point of departure, we follow Hoyles & Noss (2003) in observing\nthat tool characteristics do affect student learning:\nTools matter: they stand between the user and the phenomenon to be modeled, and shape\nactivity structures. (Hoyles & Noss,2003, p. 341)\nInstrumentation theory focuses on the mediating role of tools by\nstressing the co-emergence of tool techniques and meaning in a process of\ninstrumental genesis (Artigue, 2002; Trouche, 2004). Instrumental\ngenesis comprises the development of cognitive schemes containing\nconceptual understanding and techniques for using a tool for a specific\ntype of task. The resulting instrument integrates the tool and mental\nschemes. As a consequence, a bilateral relationship between the tool and\nthe user exists: While the student’s knowledge guides the way the tool is\nused and in a sense shapes the tool, the affordances and constraints of the\ntool influence the student ’s problem-solving strategies and the\ncorresponding emergent conceptions.\nInstrumentation theory reveals the problems that may arise when starting\nto use a ready-made computer tool and explains the importance of aligning\ntechniques that emerge in the contextual problems with the techniques in the\nlearning arrangement with computer tools. Instrumental genesis can be\nhindered by discrepancies between tool techniques and conventional paper-\nand-pencil techniques (Drijvers et al.,2007). These insights help us to avoid\nMICHIEL DOORMAN ET AL.1248\nstudents carrying out computer tasks satisfactorily without mastery of the\nunderlying mathematical concepts and not knowing what to do in problem\nsituations without the tool at hand (Hennessy, Ruthven & Brindley,2005).\nFor instance, we inserted preliminary paper-and-pencil activities as a\npreparation on techniques with the computer tool and carefully sequenced\nthe use of tool options in the learning arrangement.\nIn general, computer tools are able to dynamically and flexibly deal with\ndifferent function representations such as tables, graphs, and formulas\n(Ponte, 1992). This may help to overcome the difficulty of integrating the\noperational and structural aspects of the function concept and its different\nrepresentations (Falcade et al., 2007). Computer tools can support\nexploratory activities for coordinating dependency relationships and\ninvestigating the dynamics of co-variation (Kaput & Schorr,2007). In this\nparticular study, a computer applet called AlgebraArrows is used to support\nthe transition from a calculation understanding to an object understanding of\nfunctions. The tool, together with the tasks that aim to exploit the tool’s\naffordances, will be presented in more detail in the“Methods\n” section.\nMETHODS\nThe design of, and teaching experiments with, the learning arrangement\nnot only aim at fostering students’ functional thinking, but also at an\nunderstanding of why the particular instructional setting potentially\nsupports learning. This requires cumulative cyclic, classroom-based\ndesign research that allows for analyzing and improving learning\narrangements (Gravemeijer & Cobb, 2006). Design research involves\nformulating, testing and refining conjectures, designing instructional\nactivities, and teaching experiments with these activities. The conjectures\nprovide for a connection between the teaching experiments and an\nunderstanding of how students can be supported in the development of\nfunctional thinking. Such a progression should take into account both the\ncognitive development of the individual students, as well as the social\ncontext in which the teaching experiments are to take place (Cobb &\nYackel, 1996; Gravemeijer & Cobb,2006). We describe successively the\ndesign phase, teaching experiments and analysis in this research.\nDesign Phase\nAn important part of the design phase involved both the literature study which\nled to the theoretical framework described in section“Theoretical Framework,”\nTOOL USE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 1249\nand the design of the learning arrangement. In this section, we report on the\ndesign as it resulted from the sequence of three design cycles. As such, it is an\nimportant result from the study.\nThe learning arrangement includes (a) a computer tool called\nAlgebraArrows, (b) a student textbook with both paper-and-pencil and\ncomputer tasks, (c) a teacher guide describing the various activities and\ntheir possible orchestrations, and (d) a computer and written test.1\nThe computer toolis an applet called AlgebraArrows, which allows for\nthe construction and use of chains of operations (so-called arrow chains)\nand provides options for creating tables, graphs, and formulae and for\nscrolling and tracing. Figure 1 shows an AlgebraArrows window, in\nwhich students create and use their representations.\nAlgebraArrows is meant to support the construction of input–output\nchains of operations as a model of a dependency relationship. The applet\nis embedded in an electronic learning environment, and the researchers, as\nwell as the teacher, can monitor and compare the students’responses with\nclass results. The activity of investigating this applet in pairs is expected\nto foster a learning process of ‘trial-and-improve’ and ‘negotiation-of-\nmeaning’. During these investigations, students can find patterns and\ndevelop functional thinking while dealing with dynamic input–output\ndependencies. As such, the computer tool is expected to provide students\nFigure 1. The computer tool AlgebraArrows\nMICHIEL DOORMAN ET AL.1250\nwith a means to structure inquiry about dependency relationships through\nconstructing and modifying arrow chains and through generating and\ncomparing argumentations.\nThe student textbook describes the activities for eight lessons. The\nlearning arrangement starts with three open-ended small-group activities\nabout different dependency relationships:\nY A first one on the area of a flexible quadrilateral, which students first\nexplore using a paper model and which then leads to choosing a\nvariable and finding a linear formula.\nY A second one on the comparison of two cell phone offers, with a\nfocus on break-even points, which have proved to be suitable\nproblem situations for addressing the concept of function (Ainley,\nBills & Wilson,2005; Kalchman & Koedinger,2005; Küchemann,\n1981). As in the first activity, the functions involved are linear.\nY A third one on the braking distance of a scooter for various speeds. It\nincludes a quadratic function.\nThese three activities are meant to create an exploratory stage that\nreveals the students’ current thinking, creates the need for organizing\nseries of calculations, and provides opportunities for the teacher to\nintroduce the computer tool. The students are asked to show their\nreasoning on posters that are discussed with the whole class. This\ndiscussion focuses on differences and similarities between the three\nproblem situations and their solutions for reaching consensus about a\nmodel of a series of calculations (an arrow chain) as a sensible way to\nproceed when investigating dependency relationships. This way, lessons\nwith paper-and-pencil in the regular classroom prepare for lessons in the\ncomputer lab, which is meant to promote the integration of both\nconventional and computer tool techniques.\nAfter these three initial lessons, the arrangement continues with two\ncomputer lessons. During the computer activities, students use the computer\ntool to construct input–output chains of operations as representations of\ncalculation procedures. The chains can be applied to single numerical values\nas well as to variables, and corresponding tables, formulas, and (dot) graphs\ncan be created (Boon,2008; Drijvers et al.,2007). To shift focus towards the\ninquiry of dependency relationships, students are confronted with break-\neven problems that ask for the generation and comparison of tables of input\nand output values, and moving around in a space of possible values. This\nway, the computer tool’s slider bar and table scrolling options, in conjunction\nto the tasks, invite the students’ development of a dynamic notion of a\nvariable (see Figure1).\nTOOL USE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 1251\nThe computer activities are expected to offer students opportunities for\ncreating new mathematical goals that relate to co-variation and functions\nas mathematical objects. The emergent modeling heuristic suggests a shift\nfrom sub-models that signify repeated input –output calculations to\nmodels for reasoning about dependency-relationships, co-variation, and\nof function object properties.\nAfter these five lessons, the arrangement continues with a reflective\nlesson for aligning computer techniques with paper-and-pencil techni-\nques, and finally a computer lesson with applications and a closing lesson\nfor summarizing results and creating consensus on representations and\nfunctional reasoning. In total, the arrangement consisted of eight lessons.\nThe teacher guide describes the different activities and their possible\norchestrations. It suggests different classroom arrangements, such as small-\ngroup work, poster presentations, computer activities in pairs, and whole class\ndiscussions on the results, supported by projections of computer work (Stein,\nEngle, Smith & Hughes,2008). The whole class discussions about students’\nstrategies and inventions are to provide a basis for focusing and converging\nstudents’learning and helping them in developing their current thinking in\nanticipation of future activities (Sherin,2002). This variety of classroom\narrangements, in the intention of the designers, fosters social interaction, which\nis expected to promote the articulation of tool use and exchange of strategies as\nwell as reflection, generalization, and preparation of what is to come.\nThe final part of the learning arrangement consists of acomputer test\nand awritten test. This mixed media assessment reflects the arrangement\nas a whole and contains paper-and-pencil questions about break-even\npoints and computer tasks where students could use the applet\nAlgebraArrows.\n2 Test items in the two tests are comparable in length\nand difficulty and have similar scoring instructions.\nTeaching Experiments and Data Collection\nAfter a first small-scale pilot study, the learning arrangement was tested\nand improved in two successive teaching experiments in grade 8, with\nmid- and high-achieving 13–14-year-old students. The experiments took\neight 50-min lessons. The first teaching experiment was conducted with\nthree classes at three different schools. The second teaching experiment\nwas conducted at a somewhat larger scale. In this paper’s analysis, we\nfocus on qualitative screencast data from pairs of students in the first\nteaching experiment, backed up with quantitative posttest data from 155\nstudents from the second teaching experiment (five classes at two\ndifferent schools). The students were selected by their teachers based\nMICHIEL DOORMAN ET AL.1252\nupon following criteria we provided: average level of mathematical\nperformance, communicative attitude, and audible articulation.\nIn both teaching experiments, whole class teaching sessions, group work,\nand work in pairs were videotaped in two of the participating classes, and, in\neach of these classes, screencast-audio videos of two pairs of students\nworking with the computer tool were collected. These videos were used to\nanalyze the students’ activities during group work and during computer\nsessions. In addition, students’answers and results to the written and the\ncomputer tests administered at the end of the experiment were collected.\nAnalysis\nThe data analyses started with organization, annotation, and description of\nthe data with software for qualitative data analysis (ATLAS.ti3;s e ev a nN e s\n& Doorman,2010). Initially, the tasks in the learning arrangement served as\nthe unit of analysis for clipping the videos. Codes were used to organize and\ndocument the data. Remarkable events from the perspective of the research\nquestion were transcribed and discussed in the research team.\nIn analyzing the first teaching experiment, we constructed a storyline as a\nreconstruction of the students’learning process. The qualitative data sources\nwere discussed with two external experts to identify illuminating examples of\nthe resulted learning process. This discussion resulted in recognizing a shift in\nthe students’reasoning with functions. Next, illuminating and representative\nexamples for important steps in the shift were identified. In order to investigate\nthis shift quantitatively, we revised the computer activities for the second\nteaching experiment with a stronger emphasis on break-even points as a\nmotivation for investigating the dynamics of relationships. In addition, we\nwanted to establish to what extent the students’final performance depended\non the use of the available computer tool. We therefore added both a written\ntest and a computer test to the end of the learning arrangement.\nTo allow for quantitative analyses of these hypotheses in the second\nteaching experiment, we designed specific paper-and-pencil activities that\naimed at investigating these conjectures. We identified characteristics of\nstudent answers to codify written student material.\nNext, we distinguished solution strategies used on two similar\ncomputer tasks that were designed for studying the development of\nstudents’reasoning with the computer tool. One task was situated at the\nbeginning of the computer lessons and the other at the end. The strategies\nled to the construction of codes with respect to the use of representations\nin the computer tool. These codes could be used to codify screenshots of\nstudents’final work on the two computer tasks.\nTOOL USE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 1253\nFor the quantitative analyses, we used data from 155 students in five\nclasses. These students concluded the experiment with both the computer test\nand the written test. For 150 students, we coded their answers to the paper-\nand-pencil activity concerning the arrow chain (the booklets of five students\nwere missing). We coded the screenshots of the answers to the two computer\ntasks for all 155 students. A second researcher coded 55 out of 306 items\n(18%). Good inter-rater-reliability was achieved (with a Cohen’s Kappa of\n0.79) on these items. For a comparison of the results on the written test and the\ncomputer test at the end of the learning arrangement, we used a pairedt test.\nR\nESULTS\nThe results of the study are presented in the form of a storyline of\nstudents’learning process. This storyline is illustrated with examples of\nstudent work and is empirically supported by quantitative findings.\nThe Initial Cell Phone Offer Task: Organizing Calculations\nThe results of the initial open-ended group activities of the first teaching\nexperiment show a variety of solution strategies. Figure2 (top) shows the\ncell phone offer task. The students ’ posters that describe the two\ncellphone offers are illustrative for their attempts to organize the\nsituations mathematically, i.e., to organize repeated calculations, construct\nFigure 2. Cellphone offer task and students’posters\nMICHIEL DOORMAN ET AL.1254\nvariables, and use various representations. Some students tried to organize\ntheir repeated calculations by systematically writing them in a list (left\nposter in Figure2). This helped them to see the pattern in the calculation\nand to apply this pattern to a new input value. In fact, the way in which\nthese students listed their calculations already resembles an input–output\nrelationship (the first number varying over the input values).\nThe right poster in Figure 2 illustrates attempts of students to use\nformulas to describe their repeated calculations. Although their formulas\nare not in conventional form, they show that these students identified the\ntwo variables of the dependency relationship (m for minutes and b for\ncosts). The repeated calculations reflect how the operational aspects\nprecede the structural aspects of functions (Sfard,1991). The operational\naspects were helpful for the teacher during the discussion of the posters in\nevoking the need for determining variables, dependency relationships,\nand more efficient notations and tools for finding break-even points.\nIntroducing Arrow Chains: Visualize Functions\nThese results provide support for the argument that rather open problems\nin the beginning of a learning arrangement can result in various solutions\nof students that (1) provide information about the students ’ current\nthinking and that (2) create starting points for discussing the need for\nmore sophisticated tools.\nThese strategies were exploited by the teacher by linking the students’\ninitial ideas to the intended tool use during a classroom discussion. During\nthis discussion, new mathematical goals emerged: Repeated calculations are\ntime-consuming; what is the general pattern in the calculation procedures?\nHow can this pattern be described to calculate results‘automatically’?H o w\ncould a‘calculator’help in comparing cellphone offers?\nA calculation recipe that exists of a fixed chain of operations emerged\nfrom these activities. This arrow chain is the central representation of the\ncomputer tool. In the next activity, the last one before the computer\nlessons, the students had to draw calculation chains for the two cellphone\noffers. Figure 3 shows an illustrative answer to the task to construct a\ncalculation chain.\nThe arrow chain as a model of repeated calculations appeared to be\ngrounded in students’previous activities and could begin to function as a\nmathematical model for (in terms of the theory of emergent modeling)\nreasoning about dependency relationships. This assumption is backed up\nwith an analysis of the results of student booklets from the second\nexperiment. The analysis shows that 124 out of 150 students (83%) drew\nTOOL USE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 1255\na similar chain while another eight (5%) drew this chain, but used it only\nfor one specific calculation and did not label input and output boxes.\nUsing the Computer Tool to Create Arrow Chains\nThe third lesson, the first computer lesson, started with some introductory\nactivities and then continued with the cellphone problem (see Figure3).\nThe task was to determine, with the computer tool at hand, when it is\nadvisable to change from one offer to the other. Two students, Lily and\nRosy, worked together on this task. After reading the problem on the\ncomputer screen, they started to construct arrow chains with the computer\ntool.\n[Rosy drags an input box into the drawing area. The box is connected to the operation−80\nand that one is connected to x 0.15.]\nLily: And that added to the fixed costs.\n[R agrees and connects the chain to +22.5. Finally, they connect the chain to an output\nbox.]\nL: Well, when you call 100 min\n[Enters 100 as input in both chains. TomSeldom (Soms) is cheaper than the other offer.].\nR: … . Well, maybe 50.\n[L enters 50 as input for both chains. They look at the results and are still not satisfied.\nThey try some more input values. Finally, they enter 200 in the input box of both chains.\nFor the first time TomOften (Vaak) is cheaper than the other offer. They are satisfied with\nthis result and proceed to the next task.]\nThe vignette illustrates how the arrow chain has become a means to\norganize the situation and the calculation procedure. Lily and Rosy built\nthe chain from the input box, adding operations and finally connecting an\noutput box. This construction signifies their previous calculations. They\nfocused on specific cases by entering respectively 100, 50… and finally\n200 for comparing the differences between the two offers. The arrow\nchain is used for repeated calculations.\nFigure 3. Written calculation chains for cellphone offers (called‘Soms’and ‘Vaak’)\nMICHIEL DOORMAN ET AL.1256\nUsing the computer tool to create reverse chains\nOne of the following questions was to construct a reverse calculation chain for\ncalculating the number of calling minutes when you know the total costs. The\nfollowing vignette shows how three students (Ali, Bert, and Carl) discussed\ntheir reverse arrow chain by using the dimensions of the involved variables.\nA: You subtract that from that [points to total costs and the monthly fee] that results in an\namount.\nB: Yes, say 10 euros.\nA: And then you divide it by… what do you get… per minute or… ?\nB: per minute.\nA: Well, then you subtract 22,50 euro and divide it by 15 cent, and this results in minutes,\nand then you add 80, that are the free minutes which you receive.\n(...)\nC: amount−amount and that is still an amount and you divide that by an amount, 15 cent\n[the costs per calling minute]. The result is a number, not an amount, and that are calling\nminutes.\nThe students had to stepwise analyze and unpack the function chain\nand to reverse the operations with help of their contextual meaning. This\nvignette illustrates how the contextual activity on the reverse arrow chain\nafforded an understanding of the structure and the aim of the chain. The\ntool technique to construct chains supports this, and the chain became a\nmeans for analyzing and discussi ng relationships and successive\noperations, as a sequel to merely solving repeated calculations.\nWhole-class Discussion Capitalizing on Hands-on Experience\nThe start of the second computer lesson, the fourth in the learning\narrangement, consisted of a teacher guided classroom discussion of students’\ncomputer work by using a beamer. Topics of discussion were the possibility\nto label input and output boxes and to use tables. These tool techniques were\nalready used by some of the students and now became‘institutionalized’\nthrough the whole class discussion. The teacher starts the discussion with an\narrow chain for one of the cell phone companies.\nT: I heard different ways to find out how much I have to pay, how the amount changes,\nhow can you demonstrate that? [Silence] For example if I call 10 min. What ways do I\nhave to find out how much I pay for 10 min?\nS1: Put 10 in the input box\nT enters 10 into the input box. This gives an odd result (first 30 free minutes are subtracted).\nThe result is discussed and the teacher varies the input by entering some more values.\nT: Suppose I want to know the output from many input values, what more can I use?\nS1: The table.\nTOOL USE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 1257\nT clicks for the table tool and shows how you can scroll through the input and output\nvalues.\nT: Does anyone know another way to show how the output values change for different\ninput values?\nS2: With a graph…\nAfter this suggestion, the teacher clicks for the graph tool. She\ndemonstrates how to connect an arrow chain to the graph window.\nFurthermore, together with the students, she investigates the possibilities to\ntrace a graph and to zoom in and out. In this way, together with demonstrating\nthe tool techniques, the teacher discusses aspects of dependency relationships\nand how tables and graphs can be used to analyze their dynamics. In the\nprevious computer activities, Lily and Rosy did sometimes click for a table or\ngraph, but didn’t use it for scrolling or tracing values.\nThis vignette shows how the teacher used the computer tool to create\nwhole class consensus on how to use it for investigating input–output\nrelationships. Both the techniques and related concepts were part of the\ndiscussion. She did not show how to use these features for finding break-\neven points. That was still a task for the students.\nA Different View on Function\nDuring the third computer lesson, the sixth lesson of the learning\narrangement, we observed that the strategy of Lily and Rosy for using the\ncomputer tool had changed while solving a question about two handyman\noffers by contractors called Pieters and Tweehoog (see Figure4). The task\nis quite similar to the cellphone activity. However, the way in which they\nanalyzed the problem situation, phrased the structure of the solution\nprocedure, and how they used the representations in the tool changed\nfrom case-by-case calculations to investigating the dynamics of relation-\nships with the tools at hand. In the following vignette, Lily starts the\ndiscussion and operates the mouse and the keyboard.\nL: Company Pieters charges start costs and an hour rate… that is …\nR: Plus 92, times 30…\nFigure 4. Handyman task\nMICHIEL DOORMAN ET AL.1258\n[L drags an input and an output box into the drawing area and creates a label for the in-box]\nL: First company Pieters… I write only Pieters here, eh?\nR: Euro … plus costs per hour Pieters… and the total costs will come in here.\n[The mouse moves from inbox to outbox and she creates a label and types the name of the\noutbox. The variables are identified.]\nL: Yes, here are the costs.\n[The chain of operations is constructed and connected to the input and output boxes]\n(...)\nL: And the other is TweeHoog…\n[The inbox and outbox are positioned in the drawing area. Labels are created according to\nthe corresponding variables, with‘uurloon’for ‘hourly rate’and interpreted as number of\nhours.]\nR: Strange costs per hour 32.75.\n[The arrow chain of operations is constructed.]\nR: Now you have to connect it to a table.\n[They start to scroll in the table of the input values and quickly see that the break-even\npoint is at 18 h.]\n(...)\nL&R: From 18 h.\n[They type in their answer: from 18 h.]\nThis vignette illustrates a different view on, and use of, the arrow chain\ncompared to the initial operational left-to-right construction of a chain for\nTOOL USE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 1259\nrepeated calculations. More specifically, the vignette illustrates how the arrow\nchain had become a tool for analyzing dependency relationships. Lily and\nRosy organized the dependency relationship by identifying, positioning, and\nlabeling boxes for input and output variables and filling the gap between them\nwith operations. This construction signifies an understanding of the problem\nas a question about two dependency relationships. For investigating the\ndynamics, they successfully operated the table tool to zoom in and out for\nfinding the break-even point. The students’understanding of the problem and\nphrasing of the related mathematical goals changed and new goals did emerge\n(e.g. what are the involved variables?).\nBacking Up Case Study Findings\nThe second teaching experiment was used to quantitatively verify this\nconjecture concerning the shift in tool use during the computer activities.\nWe found that for the initial task 130 out of 155 students (84%) used the\ntool for just calculating successive input–output values, while in the task\nat the end, 89 out of 152 students (58%) used the tool for structuring and\ninvestigating the dynamics of the relationships.\nWhereas the students’ initial technique with the applet suggested a\nprocedural view on functions, this more advanced technique reflects a\nshift towards a structural view. In other words, the shift in the use of the\ntool reflects the development from viewing calculation recipes as tools for\nrepeated calculations (as processes) to reasoning with structural character-\nistics of dependency relationships (as objects).\nTo investigate whether this shift also encompassed students’written work\nduring the eight lessons, we compared the scores of the computer test and the\nwritten final test. In a pairedt test, we found no significant difference (p = 0.20)\nbetween the final scores on the written test and the computer test. The\ncorrelation of 0.38 between these scores was moderate (p = 0.001). This\nsuggests that students who improved their reasoning through the described\nshift were also shown to benefit from this during the paper-and-pencil test.\nOverview of the Findings\nTo summarize, we found useful and illuminating pointers to what a\nsequence on functions might help to achieve. The three preparatory open-\nended group activities, in the beginning of the sequence, offer students an\nopportunity to start from their own informal representations (see Figure2).\nThe initial modeling processes resulted in tentative reasoning and\nrepresentations that the teacher could build on by introducing the arrow\nchain as model of a calculation recipe. The arrow chain representation\nMICHIEL DOORMAN ET AL.1260\nmight derive its meaning from the students’previous activities and might\nsupport the emergence of the notion of dependent and independent variables\nand of chains of operations during the subsequent activities (e.g. identifying,\npositioning, connecting, and labeling input and output boxes). The notion of\narrow chains and varying input values preceded the scrolling through tables\nand zooming in graphs for finding break-even points. This is a key element\nof what is denoted‘imagery’ in the emergent modeling approach: New\nrepresentations or sub-models signify earlier activities with earlier repre-\nsentations. Table1 summarizes this envisioned development.\nC\nONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\nConclusion\nThe central question we formulated in the introduction of this paper is: How\ncan a learning arrangement with computer tools foster the transition from a\nprocedural calculation understanding to a structural correspondence and co-\nvariation understanding of functions? Although the arrangement had the\npotential to offer students opportunities to work with correspondence and co-\nvariation, in which functions represented by arrow chain and tables are starting\nto become mathematical objects for the students, we cannot claim that all\nstudents reached a structural understanding of functions within the timeline of\nthe teaching sequence. Nevertheless, we can identify the following character-\nistics of a rich learning arrangement that foster a transition from a calculation\nunderstanding to working with correspondence and co-variation:\n1. The three initial open-ended problems and the poster activity helped\nstudents in coming to see input–output structures in problems about\ndependency relationships and to use representations to explore them.\nTABLE 1\nGlobal outline of the intended learning outcomes\nStart of the learning\narrangement End of the learning arrangement\nTask\nperception\nFind value Find relationship\nTool use Construct chain (from left to\nright) and enter successive\nvalues\nConstruct chain (after identifying variables)\nand scroll table or trace graph\nTool imagery Repeated calculations Dependency relationship\nTOOL USE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 1261\n2. By enabling students to design and use arrow chains as a means of\nsupport for reasoning about calculation recipes that bear meaning in\neveryday-life phenomena, the computer tool supported the students in\ndeveloping the notion of a chain of operations.\n3. By generating the results of a series of calculations for a variety of\ninput values, the computer tool strengthened the students’notion of a\nfunction as a calculation recipe that seizes on input values and\nproduces output values.\n4. By generating output values for series of input values, by generating\ntables of input and output values, and by enabling the students to move\nup and down along these tables, the computer tool supported the\nstudents in developing a dynamic notion of a variable that can move\naround in a space of possible values.\n5. By displaying arrow chains, tables, and graphs, the computer tool\noffers representations, which the students could construe as affordan-\nces for treating functions as objects before they had become objects for\nthem.\n6. By discussing students’ work with the tool and showing specific\nfeatures that some of the students discovered, the teacher appeared\nsuccessful in having most students start using the table represen-\ntation.\nIn summary, we conclude that the learning arrangement with a\ncomputer tool helped students to overcome the difficulty of integrating\noperational and structural aspects of the concept function (Falcade et al.,\n2007; Sfard,1991). In particular, the use of the tool supported explorative\nactivities for coordinating and investigating the dynamics of co-variation\n(Kaput & Schorr,2007).\nDiscussion\nBefore discussing the conclusions of this study from a theoretical\nperspective, we first address its limitations. The sequence of eight lessons\nfostered conceptual development in the domain of functions. However,\nthe possibilities in the final tests were limited for assessing whetherall\nstudents made a similar step towards a dual conceptualization, with\nprocedural and structural views, of functions. Moreover, the validity of\nthe strategy coding for underpinning the conjecture that emerged from\nanalyzing the screencast-audio videos can be debated. The screen-audio\nvideos and the observations during the computer lessons showed that the\nfinal screenshots of an activity sometimes are only poor representations of\nMICHIEL DOORMAN ET AL.1262\nthe students’ reasoning. Students could be close to a good answer and\nthen delete everything as a result of a sudden doubt. Final screenshots\ndon’t capture this entire reasoning process. Additional information is\nneeded for a full understanding of students’conceptual development in\nrelation to their tool techniques. However, the balance between a\nmanageable data collection and as much information as possible will\nremain a problematic issue for this. A comparison with a control group is\nneeded to better understand to what extent the improvement is the result\nof this learning arrangement and the computer tool.\nFinally, the results cannot be generalized beyond this particular\nsetting. The extensive description of the interventions is intended to\nenable researchers to implement the experiment in other settings as a way\nto evaluate our findings and to contribute to the development of a more\nencompassing theory. This study started from domain-specific theories\non the acquisition of the concept of function and theoretical notions of\nemergent modeling, tool use, and instrumentation. How did the latter two\nperspectives work out? First, the notion of emergent modeling and its\nfocus on the shift from“model-of” to “model-for,” not only guided the\ndesign of the learning arrangement; indeed, the students ’ cognitive\ndevelopment, and their ways of using the tool initially as a tool for\ncalculations and later as a tool for reasoning with function, reflect this\nshift.\nSecond, instrumentation theory focuses on the interrelated develop-\nment of techniques and concepts. The careful integration of computer\nactivities and paper-and-pencil activities prevented discrepancies between\ntool techniques and conventional paper-and-pencil techniques. The\nprocess of instrumental genesis was enhanced by this alternation between\nclassroom discussion, small-group activities, and computer activities. The\nrepertoire of applet techniques, however, was small and comprised rather\nsimple technical skills. Even if we observed changes in how students built\narrow chains, the main evolution concerned the reasoning attached to\ndependency relationships and was not a technical one.\nO\nPEN ACCESS This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the\nsource are credited.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
