Hughes1,2 & Mark Warner1,2*\nWe explore the driving of LEDs by untransformed AC. An extreme case is driving 1.9 V threshold (red) \nLEDs with UK mains, peak voltage 325 V. Commonly, driving is by transformed, rectified (DC) supply \nwith a series resistor (where a significant fraction of the power is wasted) to limit current in the LED. \nWith AC, one can instead reactively limit to a maximum current safe for an LED by employing a series \ncapacitive impedance. Cheaper and simpler supplies can thus be employed in some cases. We analyse \nsuch non-linear circuits, and also explore questions of duty cycle and power experimentally.\nLight emitting diodes, LEDs, ubiquitous in modern electronic devices and lighting, are typically driven by low \nvoltages, rectified to give DC, with a current limiting series resistor, in which a significant fraction of the supplied \nenergy is dissipated. LED lamps, by contrast, have power supplies of considerable sophistication; see a  review1 \nand also here in the context of  capacitors2,3. Such lamps are still miraculously cheap, permitting their mass use \nfrom mains power and thereby revolutionising domestic and industrial lighting.\nThis paper is concerned with an obvious, very low tech alternative to drive LEDs that is never taught to phys-\nics and engineering students when they are introduced to these low voltage components. Current limiting can \ninstead be achieved reactively by a single capacitor, even when mains voltage AC is directly applied to individual \nLEDs, eliminating transformers and rectifiers, and resistive losses in associated resistors. Our simple analysis of, \nand experiment on, LEDs in non-linear operation shows that they conduct and emit light even in phases when \nthe overall applied voltage is in reverse, and the duty cycle can be extremely high or low, depending on choice of \ntotal threshold voltage of (chained) LEDs compared with the driving voltage. The ideas are partially  patented4 \nand aspects are employed in a few commercial LED lamps. They are apparently little applied elsewhere, though \nthey could in some applications reduce circuit complexity and cost.\nCapacitive coupling of AC-driven LEDs\nDC-driven LEDs need series resistors to limit current flow because of the extremely steep I –V variation after \ntheir threshold voltage Vc . See Fig. 1a,b. The characteristic in (b), with an exponential switch-on 5,6, we initially \napproximate as flat, followed by a steep region (slope 1/R) starting abruptly at Vc . We note in experiments where \nthe true exponential switch-on is revealed and discuss the time scales that thereby arise. We return elsewhere \nto the quantitative analysis of this feature. AC driving is clearly more efficient since power is only developed in \nthe LED. For a supply VDC , the ratio of the power from the LED to that in the resistor is ∼ Vc/(VDC − Vc) since \ncurrent, once it flows, is dropped through essentially Vc in the LED. This ratio of powers is often ∼ 1 , and thus the \nfraction of power wasted can be significant. By contrast, AC (mains) driving reduces the need for control/power \ncircuitry by using a series capacitor, see Fig. 1c, which offers lossless current limiting, independently of load.\nOnly capacitors and LEDs, along with elementary notions of reactive impedance, are  employed7. Simple \ncircuit analysis mostly suffices since the RC = τ timescale is short compared with the 10−2 s for the mains. The \ndifferential resistance for forward conduction, Fig. 1b, is R ∼ 10–30 /Omega1 . Even C = 1 µ F , which will be quite large \nin what follows, and a differential resistance for an LED of R = 20 /Omega1 , gives τ ∼ 2 × 10−5 s, that is ∼× 10−3 \nsmaller than the mains period. [Our examples are of UK mains at 50 Hz and 230 V RMS, 325 V peak.] We take \nthese simple concepts into a less familiar, non-linear sphere since the diode character of LEDs predominates.\nCapacitive current limiting. Maximum current in the LEDs of Fig.  1c is  limited7 by the series capacitive \nimpedance |Z|=1/ω C , where ω is the angular frequency of the AC supply, represented by V (t) = V 0 sin(ωt) \nwhere V0 is the peak voltage. Current flows when either LED is conducting, changing the charge on the capacitor \nand thus the voltage across it. Given that the point a of the capacitor is pinned close to either ±Vc during con-\nduction, then the current flow is determined by the rate of voltage change of the other end of the capacitor, that \nis of the supply. Hence the rate of change of charge is I = C dV /dt . The maximum current flows when dV /dt is \nOPEN\n1Isaac Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, 19 JJ Thomson Avenue, Cambridge CB3 0HE, United \nKingdom. 2These authors contributed equally: Robin W.

Hence, as expected for such a reactive system, Imax = CωV0 for a given supply, \nand C is simply chosen so that Imax is safe for the LEDs being driven.\nCircuit analysis. Consider the circuit of Fig.  1c, driven by V (t) = V 0 sin(ωt) . The voltage applied is \n balanced7 by that across the capacitor, Q/C, plus that at point a across the LED(s), Va:\nwhere the second form is simply the time derivative of the first. The dependence of V a(I) is complicated, with \ninitial and final approximate linearity separated by a shoulder region, a behavior that needs to be considered in \nforward and reverse condition for the LED pair. The resulting differential equation in I (t) is thus highly non-\nlinear. The signature of the full form of V a(I) emerges in the experimental data below, but the essence of a rich \nproblem, with unexpected results, arises already with the simple model form of I (V) in Fig. 1b, which ignores \nthe knee details and has I = 0 for V < Vc and I = (V − V c)/R for V > Vc , with R the differential resistance. \nWe return in a future paper to the fully non-linear analysis. We also assume below that the response time of the \ncircuit is fast compared with the driving period T = 2π/ω.\nFurther idealising the LEDs, the contribution to the diode voltage from the V − V c = IR differential resistive \nterm is taken for the moment to be small; when current flows, it is governed by the impedance of C, and the LED \nvoltages Va are pinned to ±Vc . For voltages |Va| < Vc , the diodes ensure zero current flow, I = 0.\nConsider a pair of thus idealised diodes (the circuit diagram of Fig.  1c) with a forward conduction voltage \nVc : the AC applied voltage V (t) is dropped across the capacitor as Q /C, and across the LEDs with a potential \ndependent upon their state of ON/OFF , with Va at point a. For switch-on with the capacitor initially uncharged, \nas V(t) rises from zero at t = 0 , the point a, initially at 0 V , will follow V(t) upwards as the LEDs are in the OFF \nstate; no charge flows and the lower plate of the capacitor is at the same potential as its upper plate. As Va reaches \nVc , the LED L 1 conducts whilst V(t) continues to rise, with Va now held at Vc by the action of  L1. With  L1 ON, \nthe capacitor charges with a current that varies, but only to a designed maximum. However, at V (t) = V 0 , the \nvoltage is maximal, dV /dt = 0 . Hence the capacitor no longer charges, and  L1 goes to the OFF (dark) state. \nThe time is t = T /4 , a quarter period. The voltage across the capacitor is /Delta1V= V0 − Vc and remains so until \ncharge can flow off it.\nWith V(t) now decreasing, the potential of point a decreases below Vc : it is fixed to that of the lower capacitor \nplate which follows V(t) down since the capacitor is isolated and the potential across it remains fixed. When V(t) \nhas fallen to V0 − Vc , then Va is at 0V and successively when V(t) drops to V0 − 2Vc , then Va will drop to −Vc . \nAt this point  L2 then switches to the ON state. Whilst a current flows through  L2, this will remain the state, until \nV (t) =− V 0 at which point the capacitor no longer charges, and  L2 is OFF . The time is t = 3T /4 . See Fig. 2 where \nthe switch-on time for L 2 is marked as t2 . The inset shows V a(t) constant at Vc for times after switch-on of L 1 but \n< T/4 , then dropping between T/4 and t2 , and then constant at −Vc from t2 to beyond 3T/4.\nThe time t2 , when V a(t) reaches −Vc , is determined by\n(1)Q /C + V a =V 0 sin(ωt) → I/C + dI\ndtdV a/dI = ωV 0 cos(ωt)\n(2)V 0 sin(ωt2 ) = V 0 − 2V c ⇒ t2 = T\n2π sin−1 (1 − 2V c/V 0 ).\nFigure 1.

(b) The I–V characteristic of an LED is really exponential in the forward direction around Vc , \nstarting at a voltage Vq say.

(c) An anti-parallel pair of LEDs, L1 and L2 , in series with \na capacitor C. These two LEDs could also represent two anti-parallel chains of LEDs. Conduction through L1 \nor L2 starts when the voltage at point a in the circuit (below the capacitor) is Vc or −Vc respectively [light lines: \nA transient voltage suppressor (TVS) diode (A) in parallel with the LED chains to avoid current surges at first \nswitch-on].\n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:963  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80617-2\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nReverse flow (through L 2 ) starting at the time t2 can occur before  the supply voltage reverses (at t = T /2 ) if \nVc < V0/2 (case (i)). See Fig.  2 and its inset where Vc/V0 = 0.2 is chosen as an illustration. For Vc > V0 (case \n(ii)), Eq. (2) shows that reverse flow first occurs for t2 > T /2 , that is when the supply has reversed. In both cases, \nthe on-time extends to 3T/4, where V (t) =− V 0 is at a minimum.\nAs V(t) then rises from −V0 for t > 3T /4 , point a is again isolated and the lower capacitor plate is at a poten-\ntial V0 − Vc higher than the upper plate. The lower plate thus rises as V(t) does. When V(t) has risen by 2Vc from \n−V0 , point a is at +Vc and L 1 then switches to the ON state. This time is shown as t1 in Fig. 2 and for convenience \ndepicted in the interval t > −T /4 in this periodic scheme. The continuing response of L 1 is not like its initial \nswitch-on we started with. For instance, it will switch on at a t1 < 0 with V (t)< 0 for case (i).\nThe current, normalised by the magnitude of the maximum current the capacitor can pass, I(t)/(C ωV 0) , is \nshown as a heavy trace in Fig. 2. The optical power is roughly IVc and thus proportional to the current. It is non-\nmonotonic for case (i) where Vc < V0/2 , the maxima being at t = 0 and t = T /2 when V (t) = 0 and |dV /dt| is \nmaximal. For case (ii) where Vc > V0/2 , the maxima in brightness are at switch-on, that is at times t1 and t2 of \nmaximum gradient in V(t) during the interval that conduction is occurring. These regimes are seen graphically \nin our experiments, see Fig. 3.\nChains of LEDs, power, duty cycle. The number of LEDs in the LED chains, for a given V0 \nof the supply, determines whether Vc < V0/2 or not: Vc increases linearly with the number of LEDs. \nThe maximum current is purely determined by the capacitor in case (i), Imax = CωV0 . In case (ii), \nImax = C ω cos(ωt1) = 2C ωV 0\n√\nV c/V 0 − (V c/V 0)2—as the threshold becomes comparable with V0 , the cur -\nrent from the supply reduces (since the LEDs are switched on in increasingly the “right” phase), and the capaci-\ntor has to become larger to deliver the same current. In all cases the maximum current passed by the capacitor \nmust be set to be less than the maximum of the LED; Imax < Im .\nThe power delivered is most easily estimated from the charge on the capacitor which varies between \n±C(V0 − Vc) , all of which is alternatingly dropped through roughly ±Vc of the LED chains. Thus during each \nof (t1 ,T /4) or (t2 ,3T /4) an energy of 2C(V0 − Vc)Vc is delivered. The mean power, P, is\nconsidering that the energy is delivered over a time of T /2. The estimate has some approximation since there \nis an IR voltage drop in the LED(s) too on exceeding Vc . See the supplementary material (SM) for examples of \nanti-parallel chains in LED lamps.\nThe duty cycle (in effect the fraction of time switched on) for the antiparallel pair(s) is\nwith D → 1 as t1 →− T /4 (for Vc ≪ V0).\nLEDs are often driven with peak, pulse currents far in excess (perhaps ×5 ) of their maximal steady current \nrating. Capacitive driving, because the duty cycle for any individual LED is less than 1/2, and there is a part \n(3)P = 4CV0 Vc(1 − Vc/V0 )/T,\n(4)D = (T /4 − t1 )/(T /2) = 1\n2 − 2t1 /T ,\nFigure 2.  On top of the V (t)/V 0 = sin(ωt) AC supply, the periods of emission of the LEDs L 1 and L 2 are \nshown (heavy, magenta on-line), starting at times t1 and t2 respectively. The times tc and t′\nc are when the supply \ncrosses the threshold, V 0 sin(ωtc) =± V c (light horizontal lines at ±V c ) where conduction would start in simple, \nresistively-coupled, DC-driven LEDs. Here, conduction starts well before then, indeed for this Vc < V0/2 , at a \nt1 < 0 when the supply is actually in reverse. This example is for Vc = 0.2V0 , whereupon t1 =− 0.102T  . For 50 \nHz mains, the off time is t1 − T /4 = 3.0 ms. The solid black curves are the current normalised by the maximum \ncurrent passed by the capacitor, I/(ωCV 0) . Inset: V (t)/V 0 and V a(t)/V 0 against time. While L 1 is conducting \n(until t = T /4 ), the voltage Va is pinned to Vc , that is Va = Vc . From t = T /4 until t2 , it drops with the supply as \nV a = V (t) − �V  and can be seen to reach −Vc , in this case well before V (t) = 0.\n4\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:963  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80617-2\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nof the on-time where the emission is below peak, is suited to exploiting over-driving, subject to flicker fusion \nthresholds (see discussion of flicker below).\nTo dim a lamp with a given driving capacitance, note that the power simply reduces as V2\n0 as V0 is reduced. \nThe lamp continues to emit, so long as V0 > Vc , the only effect being that the off period gets longer as Vc/V0 \ngets larger. No special circuitry is required.\nThe chains forming the anti-chain pairs do not have to be identical. For instance if some LEDs differ (to \npossibly change the colour balance), one could have unequal threshold voltages V(1)\nc  and V(2)\nc  . Repeating the \nargument leading to Eq. (2), at t = T /4 the voltage across C is �V(1) = V0 − V(1)\nc  . Switch on of L 2 is when\nwhere Vc = 1\n2\n(\nV(1)\nc + V(2)\nc\n)\n is the mean threshold voltage for the two chains. At t = 3T /4 the voltage across C \nis �V(2) = V0 − V(2)\nc  . Switch-on of L 1 is when\nso the switch on times t1 and t2 are exactly equivalent, having voltages equally displaced from ±V0 by 2Vc . There \nis no asymmetry in operation, despite the two members of the anti-chain pair differing, allowing scope for sub-\nstitution of LEDs, e.g. for tuning colour, which is equivalent to tuning the individual Vc s that make up V(1)\nc  and \nV(2)\nc  . However, there can be problems with reverse bias breakdown in some asymmetric chain pair cases: The \nreverse bias on chain L 2 is V(1)\nc  and, vice versa, that for L 1 is V(2)\nc  . A standard diode in series will offer reverse \nbias protection.\nRobustness of LED assemblies. LEDs, as distinct from conventional, rectifying diodes, are less able to withstand \nreverse bias. Indeed organic LEDs may have a reverse breakdown threshold, VZ , comparable in magnitude to \ntheir forward conduction threshold. Some typical, white, inorganic LEDs have a reverse breakdown at 5 V with \na threshold of 3 V . Each chain in the anti-parallel chain pair is subject to a reverse voltage equal to the forward \nthreshold voltage of the chain it is paired with. Certainly, without additional protection, it is not good policy \nto have chains of unequal length paired with each other. We have seen, for such cases, (short-circuit) failure of \nLEDs in chains probably due to this cause. Fluctuation analysis of threshold and breakdown variation shows \nthat LEDs where VZ = Vc exactly are completely unstable as anti-parallel, equal length/character chains. The \nproblem of LED chains of different lengths or different colours can be solved by putting in series with each paired \nLED chain a standard diode to offer reverse bias protection of a few volts.\nPotentially more serious are surges in forward current at switch on: If the assembly is connected to the \nmains when V(t) is in the interval (−Vc ,Vc ) , then initially the current flow is zero. However, if for instance V(t) \nis outside this voltage range and the capacitor is uncharged, then there would be a large current surge until the \ncapacitor is charged. In fact, the worst case would be switch on when V (t) = V 0 , the capacitor happens to be \nreverse charged to −V0 , and the LED chain is short, e.g. 1 LED, so that Va ∼ 2V0 . In that event, the forward \n(5)V (t2 ) = �V (1) − V (2)\nc = V 0 − (V (1)\nc + V (2)\nc ) ≡ V 0 − 2V c,\n(6)V (t1 ) = �V (2) − V (1)\nc = 2V c − V 0 ,\nFigure 3.

Simple red LEDs we \nhave experimented with seem reasonably robust, but other types are evidently more susceptible to such surges. \nThe LED chains are simply and cheaply protected by being in parallel with a reversed, back to back pair of ava-\nlanche diodes, that is connecting points a  and 0 in Fig. 1c (light lines). In practice this is a single component, a \n“Transient Voltage Suppressor” (TVS–bi-directional in our case).\nExperiments and closer examination. Applying 325 V AC mains to a 1.9 V LED reversed pair is straight \nforward, but the difference between Vc and V0 is so extreme that the off period is very short and harder to illus-\ntrate; see “Methods” below. We accordingly used a signal generator with peak voltage in the range V0 = 0–10.5 \nV and chain pairs of 1 and of 4 red LEDs, offering Vc = 1.9 V < V0/2 and Vc = 7.6 V > V0/2 respectively (In \nseries, the LEDs carry the same current, but the voltages add since potential is successively dropped across each \nchain member. The shoulder voltage is thus multiplied by 4.), corresponding to cases (i) and (ii); see Fig. 3. One \ncan indeed see that the LED switch-on for (i) is before the supply reaches the expected sign, and in (ii) when the \nsupply is of the expected sign, the difference being due to the ratio Vc/(V0/2).\nIn case (i), one sees that peak optical power of L  2 is close to t = T /2 , that is when V (t) = 0 and the rate of \nchange of voltage is maximal. One also sees that switch-off is slightly after t = 3T /4 , the peak of the supply, at \nvariance with the analysis above which was for a sharp cut off at Vc , see Fig. 1b. Rather, we see the effect of the \nexponential knee extending δV , say, below Vc , roughly the voltage across the LED chain when the current is low \nas V (t) →− V 0 at t = 3T /4 . After this time, V (t) and Va (which is not quite pinned, as in the simple analysis) \ndecrease by δV in an additional time, δt , given by:\nthe latter form on expanding the sine for small ωδt . Taking δV ∼ 0.2 V , one obtains for the shift of switch off  \nfrom peak supply of δt = 0.5 ms, as observed.\nCase (ii) follows the same trend—switch on is a little after V (t) = 0 for the supply, again due to the I–V shoul-\nder. This time, peak optical power is close to the switch-on time, but shifted by amounts related to the shoulder. \nSwitch-off is again after the peak in the supply, by a greater amount since the shoulder is ∼× 4 greater than in (i), \nthere being 4 LEDs in series in each chain, rather than 1. The highly non-linear character of the I − V  relation \nmakes the full analysis complicated, to which we return elsewhere.\nMains driving a single, Vc = 1.9 V anti-parallel LED pair. Consider a maximum current of, say, \nIm = 20 mA (giving peak 35  mW output). Given V0 = 325 V and ω = 100π radians.s−1 , then the required \ncapacitance is C = Im /(ωV0) = 196 nF , and needs to withstand /Delta1V= V0 − Vc ∼ 325 V of alternating sign. A \nceramic capacitor is required. The off-time of magnitude t2 − T /4 for each of L 1 and L 2 with Vc/V0 ∼ 1/200 \n(see Fig. 2) is, from Eq. (2), about 0.5 ms. At first sight phosphors should cover this very short time of no emis-\nsion, but one has to note that as t approaches T/4, the emission of L 1 , and hence the stimulation of phosphors, \nis getting small, albeit linearly. The power can be estimated from Eq. (3) and gives 23 mW , as compared with the \npeak of 35 mW; over-driving is easily possible.\nFlicker. The frequency up to which the human eye sees variation of light intensity depends acutely on the inten-\nsity ratio of the temporally varying component to the static background. The faster the variation, the larger this \nratio needs to be to perceive intensity variation. It has been found, over about a century of investigation, see for \ninstance the classic  works8,9, that the eye responds ever more poorly when variation is faster than 50 Hz. Only \nin extreme cases of the ratio of AC to DC optical power does one perceive flicker at or above 50 Hz. We have \nfound that e.g. red LEDs do not appear to flicker at 50 Hz, while super-brilliant, white (i.e. blue with phosphors) \nLEDs noticeably flicker in the circuit of Fig. 1c. If connected to a 100 Hz supply (as discussed in SM), there is no \nperceptible flicker even in extremely brilliant cases.\nOne can see if LEDs are being driven in the time-dependent way we discuss in this paper by viewing them \nin the camera of a mobile phone, where there is beating between the 50 Hz and the phone’s frame rate. But it \nseems that if one perceives residual flicker in a lamp, for instance a fluorescent tube, it is due to other faults and \nany perceived disturbance is not at 50 or 100 Hz or more. The mobile phone test was a reliable indicator in the \n10 types of lamp we took apart (see SM) as to whether an AC or DC drive was being used.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nWe conclude there are advantages to AC driving some LED assemblies capacitively, requiring one, or at most \ntwo, driver components and providing quasi continuous optical power, if the LED chain voltage shoulder is \nsmall compared with the peak AC voltage. Such methods induce students, and readers generally, to think fur -\nther about capacitor and diode operation—our approach is very uncommon and seemingly most unfamiliar: \nInitially counter-intuitive effects are presented, for instance that LEDs can conduct when the supply voltage is \nstill in reverse. Non idealised aspects of LED characteristics, for instance exponential instead of abrupt switch-\non, confront the reader immediately our experiments are analysed, and can be understood in terms of finite \nshoulder regions in the I–V characteristic.\n(7)V 0 − δV = V 0 sin[ω(3T /4 + δt)]⇒δ t= T /(2π)\n√\n2δV /V 0 ,\n6\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |          (2021) 11:963  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80617-2\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nLEDs are extremely non-linear components and the circuit analysis, though not difficult, requires applying \nthe ideas of reactive circuits carefully. We return to a more fundamental analysis at higher frequencies, that is \nwhere 1/RC is comparable to driving frequencies.\nBecause of the high efficiencies of LEDs and the rather small capacitances needed to drive them reactively, \ncapacitive effects already arise from mains wiring. Odd phenomena, such as the “ghosting” of lamps that glow \neven when isolated from the mains by an open switch, are examined in the supplementary materials (SM). There \nwe also discuss strategies for LED lamps related to the AC drive principles above, though in the literature other \ndirections seem to have been taken, still involving complex circuitry, despite resorting to anti-parallel chain pairs.\nMethods\nRather generic LEDs, red, white and green, were taken to drive capacitively. Typically the maximum current was \nIm ∼ 50 mA. Output was ∼ 20, 000  mcd at a forward current of If ∼ 30 mA. A specific red LED was OSHR5111P \n(TruOpto, from Rapid Electronics). Generally, red LEDs appeared more robust against EOS (electrical overstress-\ning) during switch-on surges and reverse bias when the other (anti) chain was conducting, than were the white \nand green LEDs.\nCeramic capacitors were used (to withstand reverse bias voltages) and bought from RS. They were in the \nrange 0.1–1 µ F , withstanding 100 - 600 V . A specific example used was a 630 V DC multi-layer Kemet capacitor, \nRS 9060660. Values were checked with a Fluke 79III multi-meter and found to be ±5% of the nominal value.\nFor protection of LEDs, a P6KE (Transil) transient voltage surge (TVS) suppressor was adopted. LEDs then \nsuffered no damage, irrespective of how the circuit was switched on.\nWhen not driving the LEDs by the mains directly, signal generators were used, for instance an Agilent 33120A \n15 MHz Function / Arbitrary Waveform Generator. Other signal generators from an undergraduate teaching lab \nwere also perfectly adequate. The mains itself, for precision measurements was not suitable since it was highly \nnon-sinusoidal due, presumably, to local loads being applied to it. Indeed the LED non-linearity turned out to \nbe a sensitive tool for examining the character of the mains.\nThe optical power output was measured from a single LED from the chain pairs of LEDs being investigated. \nThe LED fitted tightly into a very short black plastic tube at one end. At the other end was an equally tightly \nfitting photo-diode essentially facing head to head with the LED. We employed an Osram BPX65, silicon pin \nphoto-diode.\nThe driving voltage V 0 sin(ωt) and the optical power from the photo-diode voltage output were measured \nwith a PicoScope, USB 2000 & 3000 Series from which the presented signal traces were derived.\nTo reduce noise, an earthed aluminium foil cover was employed.\nReceived: 1 February 2020; Accepted: 22 December 2020\nReferences\n 1.
