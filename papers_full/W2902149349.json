    "abstract": "Diagnoses of power transformers by partial discharge (PD) measurement are effective to prevent dielectric failures of the apparatus. Ultra-high frequency (UHF) method has recently received attention due to its various advantages, such as the robustness against external noise and the capability of PD localization. However, electromagnetic (EM) waves radiated from PD tend to suffer attenuation before arriving at UHF sensors, because active part of the transformer disturbs the EM wave propagation. In some cases, that results in poor detection sensitivity. To understand propagation and attenuation characteristics of EM waves and to evaluate the detection sensitivity quantitatively, a computational approach to simulate the EM wave propagation is important. Although many previous researches have dealt with EM wave simulation for transformers, validations of those simulations by comparing with the experimental ones have seldom been reported. In this paper, cumulative energies, signal amplitudes and propagation times of EM waves were measured using a 630 kVA transformer. EM wave propagation was computed using the time-domain finite integration technique and the results were compared with the experimentally obtained ones. These simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental ones. The results can serve as guidelines to improve the efficiency of UHF PD detection and offer the possibility to achieve optimal placement of UHF sensors in power transformers.",
