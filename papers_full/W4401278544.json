  "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> The challenge of maintaining long-term factual accuracy in response to dynamic real-world entity queries is critical for the reliability and utility of AI-driven language models. The novel integration of external knowledge bases and fact-checking mechanisms in the modified Llama 3 model significantly enhances its ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. Through architectural modifications, including multi-head attention mechanisms and domain-specific modules, the model's performance was rigorously evaluated across various metrics such as factual precision, recall, F1 score, and contextual accuracy. The extensive experimental setup, involving high-performance computing resources and sophisticated training methodologies, ensured robust testing and validation of the model's capabilities. Comparative analysis with baseline models demonstrated substantial improvements in accuracy and relevance, while error analysis provided insights into areas requiring further refinement. The findings highlight the potential for broader applications and set new standards for the development of reliable language models capable of handling dynamically evolving information. Future research directions include optimizing real-time data integration and exploring hybrid models to further enhance the factuality and robustness of language models.",
