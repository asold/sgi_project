INTRODUCTION \nTransformers are a vital and expensive component of electrical power systems. The protection of \ntransformers is essential to achieve high quality performance in modern electric networks. The winding faults \non power transformers caused by high sensitivity, selectivity and fast response will be deterred by the \ndifferential protection relay [1]. Transformers with a high capacity are usually protected by a harmonic \nrestraint percentage differential relay [2]. The faults that occur in transformers are either: internal incipient \nfaults or internal short circuit faults [3]. Short circuit faults constitute about 70-80% of transformer failures, \nand these can be (1) phase-to-ground fault or (2) turn-to-turn faults [4].  \nDue to the nonlinearities in the transformer core, or in the CT core or in both case a substantial \ndifferential current may flow, when there is no fault. These false differential currents are generally sufficient \nto cause a percentage differential relay to trip. Some of these phenomena are magnetizing inrush current \nduring energization or fault removal, transformer over-excitation and CT saturation. However, in modern \ndigital relays some algorithms were developed to avoid the false tripping in percentage differential relays. \nSome of these algorithms have been developed based on different techniques, such as, artificial neural \nnetworks, fuzzy logic, wavelet transforms and principa l component analysis [5-8]. These approaches have \nlimitations that may affect their speed of operation, dependability and security. They also require complex \ncomputations and are susceptible to changes in transformer parameters.  \n \n\nInt J Pow Elec & Dri Syst ISSN: 2088-8694  \n \nSimulink model of transformer differential protection using phase angle difference … (Nassim A. Iqteit) \n1089 \nThe differential protection on magnetizing inrush currents can be averted by many effective \nmethods [9-12]. One of those methods is making the phase voltage as a control signal. And this way \nguarantee that the protected transformer is explicitly decreased in the terminal voltage. Also, implementing a \ncore-flux or transformer which is equivalent circuit for electing inrush from internal fault currents could be \nanother remarkable method. Those ways could achieve major success concerning their applications if the \ntransformer terminal voltage measured and the measurement process will be quite costly [13]. Additionally, \ncomputational burden on the differential relay would be increased so that causes a slow motion in winding \nshort circuits [14-16].  \nPhase angle difference technique, proposed by [1] is used to avoid limitations in previous \ntechniques, and to improve the reliability and fast response in percentage differential relay. In this paper to \ndiscriminate magnetizing inrush currents and short circuit faults in power transformer, the PAD technique \nwith percentage differential relays will be modeled and simulated using Simulink package in MATLAB \nsoftware. Also, the real circuit model of power transformer and CTs transformer will be considered in the \nsimulation model in both cases.  \n \n \n2. METHODOLOGY OF DIFFERENTIAL RELAY WITH PAD \n2.1.   Percentage differential (87T) characteristic \nPower transformers that are rated above 10 MVA are most commonly protected with percentage \ndifferential relay (87T) for the purposes of avoiding internal short circuits. The 87T-relay has been found to \noffer important ground and speed phase protection for 2 and 3 winding power transformers [17]. The relay \nfeatures an additional harmonics restraint unit in which massive transformer magnetizing inrush is present as \nwell as ratio matching taps. The unit prevents relay operation on transformer magnetizing inrush current.  \nThe second harmonics restraint unit is factory calibrated to restrain 15% second harmonic current, but may \nbe adjusted if required. An unrestrained instantaneous unit which operates on magnitude of difference current \nis provided to back up the percentage differential un it. The unit is adjustable from approximately 8 to 20 \ntimes tap [18]. The characteristic of percentage differential relay is providing following in Figure 1 [19, 20].  \nThe characteristic In this case the differential current is false, they still can cause a trip in a percentage \ndifferential relay. Sometimes during energization inrush current is magnetized. The situation can also occur \nduring transformer over-excitation, or fault removal, or  CT saturation. However, recently, algorithms have \nbeen developed to avoid the false tripping in percentage differential relays. Various techniques such as \nprincipal component analysis, fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks helped to to develop these \nalgorithms. These techniques have their parameters in Figure 1 are as follows:  \nI\ndiff : is magnitude of 50 Hz component for differential current.  \nIres: is magnitude of 50 Hz component for restraint current. \nIop1: is the minimum operation current. \nIop2: is the adjusted minimum operating current \nIres, min: is minimum restraint current. \nk: gradient of the functional characteristic which are, 10, 20 or 40%.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

Fault discrimination techniques in power transformers \n2.2.1. Transformer current transient components technique \nThe described technique is utilized to discern between external and internal faults within power \ntransformers. The phase transient currents (all three) of the transformer go through conversion into the modal \ncurrent components by way of Clarke's transformation to give ground mode I0, areal mode I1 as well as areal \nmode I2. High and low tension sides of the transformer give transient modal currents which are used with the \nFault Discrimination Equation (FDE), which in turn is able to discern internal from external faults based on \npolarity of its output. The polarity of the FDE, for internal faults, will register negative whereas it will be \nlargely positive for external faults. The following equation provides the fault discrimination equation:  \n \n𝐹𝐷𝐸 ൌ 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒ሼሺ𝐼\n଴ሻ௧௛ ∙ሺ𝐼଴ሻ௧௟ ൅ሺ𝐼ଵሻ௧௛ ∙ሺ𝐼ଵሻ௧௟ ൅ሺ𝐼ଶሻ௧௛ ∙ሺ𝐼ଶሻ௧௟ሽ (5) \n \nWhere,  \n(I0)th , (I0)tl : are the currents (transient ground mode) on high and on low tension sides. \n(I1)th , (I1)tl : are the currents (transient aerial mode) 1 on high and on low tension sides. \n(I2)th , (I2)tl : are the currents (transient aerial mode) 2 on high and on low tension sides. \n \n2.2.2. Fault detection process in power transformers applying the Discrete Wavelet Transform \nThe Discrete Wavelet Transform technique is used for on-line fault detection within power \ntransformers. Wavelet technique is a time-scale domain approach, which is applied to locate short circuit \nfaults and incipient faults through comparison of performance during normal operation of the power \ntransformer. The following steps outline the fault detection algorithm [23]: \nStep 1: Obtain and record current signals from power transformer terminals.  \nStep 2: Analyze the signal applying a wavelet taken from a wavelet family, for the required level of \ndecomposition.  \nStep 3: Assess the approximate coefficients and detail of Discrete Wavelet Transform with time \nthrough firstly plotting a sample—coefficient graph.  \nStep 4: Locate the fault via wavelet coefficient interpretation.  \nStep 5: Differentiate fault current (incipient), from internal short circuit current and ordinary \noperation current.  \n \nInt J Pow Elec & Dri Syst ISSN: 2088-8694  \n \nSimulink model of transformer differential protection using phase angle difference … (Nassim A. Iqteit) \n1091 \nDiscrete wavelet transform is also a technique that is used. It can be applied together with back \npropagation neural networks and is applied to classify different internal fault types in a three-phase \ntransformer [24].  \n2.3.   Phase angle difference (PAD) principle technique \nTo differentiate the internal fault current from a different disturbance in a power transformer,  \nthe PAD in the fundamental frequency components will be used as the guide [25, 26]. It is not necessary that \nthe exact PAD is used. The location of  relative to the PAD scheme operating characteristic can be \nestimated to find the status of a given power transformer. Figures 2 and 3 highlights that the operating mode \nof the power transformer is the main determinant of the principle of Phase Angle Difference. Under normal \noperation as well as in external fault, the line currents flow are parallel with the variance in phases being \nalmost zero as shown Figures 2(b) and 2(e) respectively. However, during the magnetizing inrush currents, \nthe PAD is approximately 90o since it is largely inductive as seen in Figure 2(a). Subjecting the transformer \nto winding short current reverses either, if the transformer is exposed to a winding short circuit, either I1 or \nnI2 current. In this case the PAD becomes greater that 90o  in turn-to-turn fault and turn-to-ground fault as is \nvisible in Figures 2(c) and 2(d). Now, through using Idiff and Ires, we can estimate PAD without placing \nmuch strain on the relay with great computations which would in turn slow its response. Figure 3 shows how \nto estimate PAD in a power transformer on different operation modes.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. PAD between the 50Hz components of phase A respective currents.

Figures 10(a) and 10(b) compares the proposed Simulink model and EMTP-RV simulation \npackage [1] in the case of inrush currents, where the results were found close to each other. In the obtained \nresults of Figure 10(a), the breaker BA was switched on after one cycle of running model. A magnetizing \ninrush current of amplitude up to 8 times the transformer rated current is simulated. It is obvious that such \ninrush current causes the mal-operation of the differential relay.

The Simulink model is \nsimulated at different modes: normal loading, inrush currents and internal and external faults. The simulation \nresults show that the proposed algorithm has good reliability, largely independent of harmonic contents in the \n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n-10\n0\n10\nia1 (pu)\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n-2\n0\n2\n(b)\nia2 (pu)\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n-1012\nX: 0.02639\nY: 1 (c)\n87T relay\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n-1012\nX: 0.03715\nY: 1 (d)\nPAD\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n-1012\n(e)\nTime\nFinal Trip\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n-20\n0\n20\nia1 (pu)\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n-20\n0\n20\n(b)\nia2 (pu)\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n-1012\n(c)\n87T relay\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n-1012\n(d)\nPAD\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n-1012\n(e)\nTime\nFinal Trip\nInt J Pow Elec & Dri Syst ISSN: 2088-8694  \n \nSimulink model of transformer differential protection using phase angle difference … (Nassim A.
