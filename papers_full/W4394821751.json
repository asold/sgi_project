  "abstract": "Abstract The paper explores the potential applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in the legal field, focusing on how they can enhance access to law. We begin by elucidating the fundamental workings of LLMs and their current and future general applications. The core of our study predicts the utilization of LLMs in various legal domains, especially where tasks like text retrieval, generation, labeling, and classification are prevalent. We argue that tools like ChatGPT could play a pivotal role in these areas. Additionally, we discuss the limitations and customization requirements of LLMs, particularly for legal uses. An experiment conducted by one of the authors, involving a tailored version of GPT for small law firms, serves as a practical example, but building on this, the paper also proposes ways in which LLM-based applications could democratize access to justice, making legal assistance more accessible and efficient for the broader public. This study contributes to the understanding of the intersection between AI technology and legal services, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges in this field.",
