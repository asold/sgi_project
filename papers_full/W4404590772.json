  "abstract": "Abstract Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have spurred interest in their potential applications across various fields, including actuarial work. This paper introduces the use of LLMs in actuarial and insurance-related tasks, both as direct contributors to actuarial modelling and as workflow assistants. It provides an overview of LLM concepts and their potential applications in actuarial science and insurance, examining specific areas where LLMs can be beneficial, including a detailed assessment of the claims process. Additionally, a decision framework for determining the suitability of LLMs for specific tasks is presented. Case studies with accompanying code showcase the potential of LLMs to enhance actuarial work. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs can be valuable tools for actuarial tasks involving natural language processing or structuring unstructured data and as workflow and coding assistants. However, their use in actuarial work also presents challenges, particularly regarding professionalism and ethics, for which high-level guidance is provided.",
