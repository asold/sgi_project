  "abstract": "Prediction of foundation or subgrade settlement is very important during engineering construction. According to the fact that there are lots of settlement‐time sequences with a nonhomogeneous index trend, a novel grey forecasting model called NGM (1,1, k , c ) model is proposed in this paper. With an optimized whitenization differential equation, the proposed NGM (1,1, k , c ) model has the property of white exponential law coincidence and can predict a pure nonhomogeneous index sequence precisely. We used two case studies to verify the predictive effect of NGM (1,1, k , c ) model for settlement prediction. The results show that this model can achieve excellent prediction accuracy; thus, the model is quite suitable for simulation and prediction of approximate nonhomogeneous index sequence and has excellent application value in settlement prediction.",
