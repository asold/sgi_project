  "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing tasks, revolutionizing the field with their ability to understand and generate human-like text. As the demand for more sophisticated LLMs continues to grow, there is a pressing need to address the computational challenges associated with their scale and complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of hardware accelerators designed to enhance the performance and energy efficiency of large language models. By examining a diverse range of accelerators, including GPUs, FPGAs, and custom-designed architectures, we explore the landscape of hardware solutions tailored to meet the unique computational demands of LLMs. The survey encompasses an in-depth analysis of architecture, performance metrics, and energy efficiency considerations, providing valuable insights for researchers, engineers, and decision-makers aiming to optimize the deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.",
