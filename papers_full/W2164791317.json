INTRODUCTION\nThe multisection transformer is a standard tool in micr owave\nengineering to obtain impedance matching in transmission line circuits\nsupporting transverse electromagnetic (TEM) propagation [1, 2]. In\nthe 1950s classical design methods, e.g., binomial and Chebyshev\nsynthesis [1], were introduced to design transformers giving impedance\nmatching in a single passband. Classical transformers consist of a\ncascade of uniform transmission line sections which are a quarterwave\nlong at the central frequency of the matching band. Other methods to\ndesign multisection transformers consisting of uniform or nonuniform\ntransmission line sections are dealt with in [3–5].\n306 Castaldi, Fiumara, and Gallina\nHowever, the above mentioned methods faced the problem of\ndesigning impedance transformers working in a single passband. On\nthe other hand, in many cases of practical interest (cellular/PCS,\nWLAN, GSM/DCS and other dual-band applications [6–9]) impedance\nmatching over two separate bands can be required. So, in the last\nyears various design methods for dual-band impedance transformers\nhave been proposed [10–14]. In particular, the synthesis problem of a\ndual-band two-section one-third wavelength transformer with the two\nbands centered at a given frequencyf\n1 and at its ﬁrst harmonic 2f1 is\ndealt with in [10] and [11]. The more general problem of designing a\ntransformer working in two bands centered at two arbitrary frequencies\nis solved in [12] and [13], but only for a two-section transformer.\nFinally, the problem of designing a transformer with an arbitrary even\nnumber of quarter-wavelength uniform sections working in two bands\ncentered at two frequencies f\n1 and f2 ≤ 3f1 is solved in [14], but\nunder the small-reﬂections approximation. In particular, the method\nintroduced in [14] is a generalization of the standard approximate\nsingle-band Chebyshev transformer design [1] in which the input\nreﬂection coeﬃcient obtained using the small-reﬂection approximation\nis expressed as a Chebyshev polynomial with argument cosθ, θ being\nthe electrical length of the transformer sections. The basic idea of\nthe dual-band synthesis in [14] consists in replacing the argument\ncosθ by a suitable second order polynomial in cos θ. Note that this\nmethod gives accurate results only if the range of the ratio Z\nL/Z0 is\nabout 1/2 ≤ ZL/Z0 ≤ 2, where ZL is the real valued impedance to\nbe matched to the transmission line with real valued characteristic\nimpedance Z\n0 [1].\nIn this paper we present a dual-band design method which\novercomes the limits on the ratio of the impedances ZL/Z0 and\nfrequencies f2/f1 of the procedure in [14]. The method is based on\nthe exact Collin-Riblet design procedure [15, 16] which allows the\ncharacteristic impedances of the transformer sections to be iteratively\ncalculated once the power loss ratio (the power available from the\ngenerator divided by the power delivered to the load) is given. In\nthe exact synthesis of single-band equi-ripple transformers the power\nloss ratio is enforced to be a suitable function of the Chebyshev\npolynomial with argument cos θ [1]. Our method for the exact dual-\nband design is based (as in [14]) on replacing the argument cos θ by\na suitable second order polynomial in cos θ. In this way, we can\nobtain impedance transformers, consisting of a cascade of N =2 M\nuniform transmission line sections which are a quarter wave long at\nthe frequency f\n0 =( f1 + f2)/2, working in two bands Ω 1 and Ω2\ncentered at two arbitrary frequencies f1 and f2, respectively, without\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, PIER 86, 2008 307\nany restriction on the ratio ZL/Z0 and on M.\nIn terms of passband tolerance (largest reﬂection coeﬃcient absolute\nvalue) in the two required bands Ω\n1 and Ω 2, the N-section\ntransformer obtained using our method outperforms the exact single-\nband Chebyshev N-section transformer whose passband encompasses\nboth Ω\n1 and Ω2, which is perhaps the most obvious alternative design.\nWe also analyze the robustness of our method with respect to the\nabsorption, showing that moderate dielectric losses in the transmission\nline sections do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the transformer performance.\nMoreover, we explore the possibility of using our synthesis procedure\nalso in the case of waveguiding structures supporting quasi-TEM\npropagation, showing that our method gives very good results in facing\nthe impedance matching problem in microstrip line circuits.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Our method is introduced and\ndiscussed in Section 2. Results follow under Section 3. Section 4 deals\nwith the design of microstrip transformers. Conclusions follow under\nSection 5.\n2. ANEXACTDUAL-BANDCHEBYSHEVIMPEDANCE\nTRANSFORMER\nIn this section we present our method to design a dual-band Chebyshev\nimpedance transformer based on the exact Collin-Riblet synthesis\nprocedure [15,16].\nConsider the synthesis problem of an impedance transformer\nconsisting of N-sections having the same electrical length θ =2 πl/λ,\nl and λ being the optical length of the sections and the wavelength\nin the vacuum, respectively, that matches a load of impedance Z\nL to\na transmission line of characteristic impedance Z0 (both ZL and Z0\nare assumed to be real-valued) in two separate equal-width frequency\nbands, namely Ω1 =[ f1 − ∆f,f 1 +∆ f] and Ω2 =[ f2 − ∆f,f 2 +∆ f],\nwhere f1 and f2 are two arbitrary frequencies. Following the Collin-\nRiblet procedure, we consider the power loss ratioPLR [1]\nPLR(θ)= PG\nPL(θ) = 1\n1 −| Γ(θ)|2 (1)\nwhere PG and PL are the power available from the generator and the\npower delivered to the load, respectively, and Γ is the input reﬂection\ncoeﬃcient. It can be shown that P\nLR can be expressed as [16]\nPLR(θ)=1+ Q2\nN (cosθ) (2)\nwhere QN (·) is an even or odd polynomial of order N. Once\nthe polynomial QN (·) is given, the Collin-Riblet design method\n308 Castaldi, Fiumara, and Gallina\nallows the characteristic impedances of the transformer sections to be\ncalculated [15,16].\nThe polynomial QN (·) can be chosen so that the impedance\nmatching condition is obtained in the two separate equal-width bands\nΩ\n1 and Ω2. To this end, we choose N =2 M and l = c/(4f0), where c\nis the velocity of the light in the vacuum and f0 =( f1 + f2)/2. The\nelectrical length of each section is θ = πf/ (2f0), and the two bands\nΩ1 and Ω2 can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless variable θ,\nnamely Θ1 =[ θ1 − ∆θ, θ1 +∆ θ] and Θ2 =[ θ2 − ∆θ, θ2 +∆ θ], where\nθ1 = πf1/(2f0), θ2 = πf2/(2f0)= π − θ1 and ∆θ = π∆f/(2f0). In\norder to obtain an equi-ripple power loss ratio in the two bands Θ 1\nand Θ2, we enforce\nQ2M = kTM (a cos2 θ + b) (3)\nwhere TM is the Mth-degree Chebyshev polynomial anda, b and k are\nconstants to be determined. Note that our method is a variation of the\nsingle-band Chebyshev synthesis, using the second order polynomial\na cos\n2 θ + b as the argument of the Chebyshev polynomial instead of\nthe ﬁrst order polynomial used for the single-band design [1]. In order\nto obtain the impedance matching in the two bands Θ\n1 and Θ2,w e\nenforce the condition −1 ≤ a cos2 θ + b ≤ 1 for θ ∈ Θ1 ∪ Θ2, which,\nin view of the symmetry of the polynomiala cos2 θ + b with respect to\nπ/2, can be obtained enforcing\n{\na cos2(θ1 − ∆θ)+ b = −1\na cos2(θ1 +∆ θ)+ b =1 (4)\nEquation (4) gives the constanta and b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na = 2\ncos2(θ1 +∆ θ) − cos2(θ1 − ∆θ)\nb = −cos2(θ1 +∆ θ) + cos2(θ1 − ∆θ)\ncos2(θ1 +∆ θ) − cos2(θ1 − ∆θ)\n(5)\nFinally, the constantk can be obtained by considering\nPLR(0) = |R +1 |2\n4R (6)\nwhere R = ZL/Z0.

REPRESENTATIVERESULTS\nAs an illustration of our method, in this section we present some\nrepresentative results. Given the two frequency bands Ω\n1 and Ω2\nand the impedances Z0 and ZL, following the method described in\nthe above section we computed the characteristic impedances of the\ntransformer sections. In all calculations we performed, the values\nof these impedances resulted to be real and positive according to\nthe physical realizability stated by the Riblet theory. Once the\ncharacteristic impedances of the N-sections of the transformer had\nbeen computed, we calculated the input reﬂection coeﬃcient of the\ntransformer Γ\nin(θ) using the transmission matrix method [1]. In\nall simulations |Γin(θ)| exactly agreed with the reﬂection coeﬃcient\nabsolute value |Γ(θ)| obtained substituting Equations (3) and (2) in\nEquation (1), that is\n|Γ(θ)| = |kTM (a cos2 θ + b)|\n[\n1+ k2T 2\nM (a cos2 θ + b)\n]1/2 (8)\nAs a ﬁrst case, we considered R =4 , N =4 , θ2/θ1 =2 .5 and\n∆θ/θ1 =0 .2. In Fig. 1, |Γin| of our dual-band exact Chebyshev\ntransformer (henceforth called dual-band transformer) is displayed as\na function of the electrical lengthθ and compared to the one of a four\nsection single-band exact Chebyshev transformer (henceforth called\nsingle-band transformer), synthesized using the exact Collin-Riblet\nmethod, with a passband Θ encompassing both required passbands,\ni.e., Θ = [θ\n1−∆θ, θ2+∆θ]. The passband toleranceρm of the dual-band\ntransformer is about 6.3dB lower than the single-band transformer one.\nIn order to perform an extensive comparison between the dual-\nband transformer and the single-band transformer, we analyzed the\ninput reﬂection coeﬃcient spectrum of both transformers by varying\nthe parameters R, N,∆ θ/θ\n1 and θ2/θ1. Fig. 2 shows the passband\ntolerance ρm of the dual-band transformer and the single-band\ntransformer as a function ofR for N =4 , θ2/θ1 =2 .5 and ∆θ/θ1 =0 .2.\nAs expected, the ρm of both transformers increases with R, and the\ndual-band transformer outperforms the single-band transformer by\nroughly 6.3dB for all R values.\nIncreasing the number of the sectionsN, obviously theρ\nm of both\ntransformers decreases, while the diﬀerence between the ρm of the\n310 Castaldi, Fiumara, and Gallina\n0.0000π 0.7854π 1.5708π 2.3562π 3.14\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n|Γin|  (dB)\nθ\n0                    π/4                    π/2                  3π/4                     π0.0000π 0.7854π 1.5708π 2.3562π 3.14\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n|Γin|  (dB)\nθ\n0                    π/4                    π/2                  3π/4                     π0                    π/4                    π/2                  3π/4                π\nFigure1.

The ρm of both\ntransformers increases with θ2/θ1, while the diﬀerence increases from\n1.3dBto13 .7dB with θ2/θ1 ranging from 1.7t o4 .7.\nFinally, Fig. 5 shows the passband toleranceρm of the dual-band\ntransformer and the single-band transformer as a function of ∆θ/θ1 for\nN =4 , R = 4 andθ2/θ1 =2 .5. For low values of ∆θ/θ1 the dual-band\n312 Castaldi, Fiumara, and Gallina\ntransformer exhibits very low values of ρm outperforming the single-\nband transformer by about 38.5dB. Both the dual-band transformer\nand the single-band transformer ρm increase with ∆ θ/θ1 while the\ndiﬀerence decreases up to zero for ∆ θ/θ1 =0 .75, corresponding to\nθ1 +∆ θ = θ2 − ∆θ.\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\nρm  (dB)\n∆θ/θ1\nFigure 5.

Dual-band transformer and single-band\ntransformer input reﬂection coeﬃcient absolute values are shown in\nFig. 6 forR =4 ,N =4 ,θ\n2/θ1 =2 .5 and ∆θ/θ1 =0 .2. The single-band\ntransformer is forced to have the same passband tolerance of the dual-\nband transformer, namely ρ\nm = −30.06dB. It is seen in Fig. 6 that\nthe single-band transformer does not cover both passbands of the dual-\nband transformer. The same behavior has been observed also varying\nthe parametersR, N, θ\n2/θ1 and ∆θ/θ1. Figs. 7 and 8 show the ratio of\nthe single-band transformer passband ∆θ to ∆Θ = (θ2+∆θ)−(θ1−∆θ)\nas a function of θ2/θ1 and ∆θ/θ1, respectively. As expected, ∆θ/∆Θ\ndecreases with θ2/θ1 and increases with ∆ θ/θ1.

MICROSTRIPTRANSFORMERS\nThe method presented and discussed in the previous sections works\nin the case of TEM propagation in transmission lines. On the other\nhand, wave-guiding structures supporting not-TEM propagation are\nbeing used more and more in current micr owave applications. For\nexample, planar microwave circuits based on microstrip lines have\n316 Castaldi, Fiumara, and Gallina\nreceived intensive development in the last few decades [17–19]. A\nmicrostrip line supports quasi-TEM mode propagation which can be\napproximated by TEM propagation in a transmission line with eﬀective\ndielectric constant and characteristic impedance evaluated via a quasi-\nstatic approximation [2]. In this section we demonstrate that our\nmethod can also be used in the design of a microstrip transformer,\nshowing that quasi-TEM to TEM approximation has negligible eﬀects\non the transformer performance.\nLet us consider the problem of synthesizing a microstrip\ntransformer matching, in two separate bands, a given microstrip line\nto a known planar load Z\nL. Given the height and the dielectric\nconstant of the substrate, the design procedure consists in ﬁnding\nout the widths of the microstrip sections. At ﬁrst, we compute the\ncharacteristic impedance of the transmission line equivalent to the\ninput microstrip line using the quasi-static approximation formulas\nreported in [2]. Then, using our method, we perform the synthesis of\nthe transformer matching the equivalent transmission line to a load of\nimpedance Z\nL in the two desired bands, obtaining the characteristic\nimpedances Zi (i =1 ,...,N ) of the transformer sections. Finally,\nusing again the quasi-static approximation formulas, we compute the\nwidths of theN sections of the microstrip transformer corresponding to\nthe Z\ni (i =1 ,...,N ). The performance of the microstrip transformer\nis then analyzed via a full-wave commercial software package [20].\nAs a ﬁrst example, we consider a microstrip line with a substrate\nconsisting of 0.20mm height RT/duroid 5880 having relative dielectric\nconstant equal to 2.2. The width of the microstrip line isw =0 .62mm,\ncorresponding to a characteristic impedance Z0 = 50Ω, the load\nimpedance is ZL = 200Ω. At ﬁrst, we consider the problem faced\nin the ﬁrst case of Section 3, for which R =4 , N =4 , θ2/θ1 =2 .5\nand ∆ θ/θ1 =0 .2, giving a transformer with monotonous step to\nstep impedance variation. The input reﬂection coeﬃcient absolute\nvalue |Γ\nin| of the microstrip transformer, computed via the full-wave\nanalysis, is compared with the |Γ| given by Equation (8) in Fig. 10,\nwhere |Γ| and |Γin| are displayed as functions of θ. As it can be seen,\nthe |Γin| proﬁle well agrees with the|Γ| one. As a further example, we\nconsider the matching problem with parameter values as above but for\nθ\n2/θ1 =3 .5, giving a transformer with a non-monotonous step to step\nimpedance variation as shown in Section 3.|Γ| and |Γin| are displayed\nin Fig. 11, showing a very good agreement between the two proﬁles\nalso in this case.\nAll simulations performed using diﬀerent parameter values\nconﬁrmed these results.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, PIER 86, 2008 317\n0.00π 0.25π 0.50π 0.75π\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n|Γ|, |Γin|  (dB)\nθ\n0                    π/4                    π/2                  3π/4                     π0.00π 0.25π 0.50π 0.75π\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n|Γ|, |Γin|  (dB)\nθ\n0                    π/4                    π/2                  3π/4                     π\nFigure 10.Reﬂection coeﬃcient absolute value vs. θ: theoretical\nvalues |Γ| (solid line) and full-wave analysis values|Γin| (dashed line)\nfor R =4 , N =4 , θ2/θ1 =2 .5 and ∆θ/θ1 =0 .2.\n0.00π 0.25π 0.50π 0.75ππ\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n|Γ|, |Γin|  (dB)\nθ\n0                    π/4                    π/2                  3π/4                     π0.00π 0.25π 0.50π 0.75ππ\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n|Γ|, |Γin|  (dB)\nθ\n0                    π/4                    π/2                  3π/4                     π\nFigure 11.Reﬂection coeﬃcient absolute value vs. θ: theoretical\nvalues |Γ| (solid line) and full-wave analysis values|Γin| (dashed line)\nfor R =4 , N =4 , θ2/θ1 =3 .5 and ∆θ/θ1 =0 .2.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have introduced a new exact synthesis method of multisection\nimpedance transformers for transmission line circuits supporting TEM\npropagation. Our method allows the design of dual-band transformers\nwith N =2 M sections working in two bands Ω\n1 and Ω2 centered\nat two arbitrary frequencies f1 and f2, respectively, without any\n318 Castaldi, Fiumara, and Gallina\nrestriction on M and on the values of the impedances to be matched.\nIn terms of passband tolerance in the two required bands Ω1 and Ω2,\nour transformer, which consists of a cascade of uniform transmission\nline sections which are a quarter wave long at the frequency f\n0 =\n(f1 +f2)/2, outperforms the exact single-band Chebyshev transformer\nwhose passband encompasses both Ω 1 and Ω2, which is perhaps the\nmost obvious alternative design. We have also explored the possibility\nof using our synthesis in the case ofwaveguiding structures supporting\nquasi-TEM propagation, showing that our method gives very good\nresults in designing impedance transformers for microstrip circuits.\nREFERENCES\n1.
