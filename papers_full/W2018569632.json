    "abstract": "Remaining Life of the oil-immersed transformer is decided due to deterioration of the winding insulation paper (WIP). The DGA method is conventionally used to estimate the WIP deterioration status condition. This paper presented the four status conditions assessment of paper deterioration for oil-immersed transformer using fuzzy-logic (FL). In this paper the correlation between accumulated values of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) with insulation resistance in oil-filled power transformers is studied using FL. The authors have estimated the insulation paper deterioration condition using proposed method for 20 transformers or more. As a result, appropriate maintenance scenario can be planned.",
