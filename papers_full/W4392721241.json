    "abstract": "Disinformation has been fueled in recent years, and inoculation theory offers an approach to supply the tools that will enable citizens to identify disinformation.It proposes that interventions can act like \"vaccines\" by exposing individuals to controlled doses of false or misleading information.This project draws on that theory to design a conversational agent that uses language modeling to surface strategies commonly used in disinformation.This paper lays out the motivation for the work, points to referential literature and related work, presents core design elements, and delineates future design directions based on testing data.",
