Large power transformers are the most expensive and strategica lly important components of any \npower generation and transmission system. Their reliability has crucial importance for the energy system \noperation. Insulation breakdown can  generate a serious failure of a large power transformer, which causes \nsubstantial costs to repair and financial loss due to power out age. Most power utilities are, therefore, highly \nmotivated to assess the actual condition of the transformer ins ulation system. The majority of transformer \ncondition check methods are only available for off-line periodi c diagnostics. The acoustic emission (AE) \nmethod as a complex online dia gnostics technique to identify ev olving failures is proposed. Results of \nmeasuring the acoustic signals generated by the presence of imp urities in transformer oil and determining \nthe impurities influence on its condition as an indicator of the transformer condition is presented. \n1 Introduction  \nThe power transformers are the most important and \nexpensive part in a power system and considered to be \nreliable components of electrical stations if their design \nlife is 20-35 years (increasin g to 50 years in practice \nwith appropriate maintenance). Effective condition \nmonitoring of these assets can protect loss of supplies to \nlarge populations of customers, while the threat of \nexplosions and fire, causing irreparable damage, can \ninjury the station and personnel and pose a risk to safety \nand the environment with pot entially serious legal and \nregulatory implications. Therefore, the welfare of \ntransformers remains at the forefront of utilities’ asset \nmanagement and obligations [1]. \nA survey of senior utility managers [2] showed that \nmore than two-thirds of answers were related to the \nadverse stock of transformers, an issue which was one of \nthe most important problems for utilities. The majority \nof power transformers currently in operation were \ninstalled in the 60’s and 70’s of the previous century. \nThey might have reached a critical age with an operating \ntime of 30 years and more. Based on obtained answers, \nKurtz et al. [2] determined that the amount of \nproblematic units is maximal when transformers reach \n35-40 years (Fig. 1). \nUtilities have to perform modernization or \nreplacement of service-aged transformers, depending on \neach transformer technical c ondition and operational \ncosts. A modernized transformer may serve 10-15 years \nbut requires a careful maintenance, regular inspections \nand checks. Therefore, the investment in a new \ntransformer may be postponed. The modernization costs \nare significantly less than a new unit cost [3]. \n \nFig. 1. Typical demographic data sorted by condition [2]. \nMalewski et al. [3] calculated the  costs of a typical \ntransformer. The cost of components and labor involved \nin modernization was 23% of a new transformer cost. At \nthe same time the cost of condition assessment (1%) was \nnegligible compared to the modernization cost. It was \nespecially relevant for high  power transformers because \ntheir investment cost in relation to the total cost of \ntransmission, division and distribution devices was about \n20%. In extreme cases transformer failure cost might \nexceed its construction cost five times [4]. \nTherefore, EAM is an important issue of operation \nmanagement and should be applied to power transformer \nmaintenance including adva nced fault prevention and \nimmediate diagnostics to a void unexpected breakdowns. \nSome components of EAM systems in the majority of \ncountries were discussed in [5-11]. \nTherefore, that the utility managers were unanimous \nin their assessment that improved methodologies are \nnecessary for power transformers [2]. Currently, there \nhas been a growing interest in the condition assessment \nof transformer insulation. Since the majority of \ntransformer components are located within the main \ntank, the transformer oil sample can provide the \ninformation about its condition [12].  \n    \n \nDOI: 10.1051/, 01008 (2017) 711301008MATEC Web of Conferences 113\n12th International  Scientific-Technical  Conference  on  Electromechanics  and  Robotics  \"Zavalishin's  Readings\"  -  2017\nmatecconf/201\n© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Practically, it means that \nestimated lifetime of a 50 year-old transformer is \nreduced to 25 years if maximum allowed operating \ntemperature (90°C) is exceeded on average by 8°C [13]. \nThere is variety of reason s to increase operating \ntemperature. This study prefers to discuss water content, \ncellulose and gas phrase as the main reasons.  \n2 Effect of impurities on transformer oil \ncondition \n2.1 Water influence \nThe importance of moisture presence in paper-oil \nsystems has been recognized  since the 1920s [14]. Pure \ntransformer oil consists of saturated hydrocarbons such \nas paraffins and naphthenes. Because of their nonpolar \nmolecule structure, pure oil can dissolve only a very \nsmall quantity of water dispersed as water vapour \naccording to Henry’s law [15]. One drop of water is \nenough to saturate one liter of new oil [16].  \nWater causes three dangerous effects: it decreases the \ndielectric withstand strength, accelerates cellulose aging, \nand causes the emission of bubbles at high temperatures \n[17-20]. The knowledge about the actual moisture \nconcentration is required to control transformer \ncondition. Therefore, different methods and \ninstrumentation are used to measure moisture. \nEquilibrium diagram methods attempt to derive \nmoisture in solid insulation from moisture content in oil \n(Du el al. [14], Fabre et al. [18], Oommen [21], Griffin et \nal. [22]) However, the methods fail, where aging of oil \nand water titration has the major impact [23]. \nKarl Fischer introduced the titration method in 1935. \nTitration basically means adding a reagent of a known \nconcentration (titr e) to an unknown substance until the \nconcentrations are balanced. It measures moisture \ncontent related to oil weight (ppm as µg water/g oil) or \nas relative moisture saturation to saturation value (%). \nNowadays this method is considered to be the most \nreliable method and it also serves as a benchmark for \nother methods. Nevertheless, this method is subject to \nseveral faults, which may lead to a bad comparability of \nresults. They are listed below: \n- there is always a moisture ingress from atmosphere \nduring sampling, transportation and sample preparation; \n- cellulose binds water with chemical bonds of \ndifferent strengths and releases water under the influence \nof heating and time; \n- laboratories differently treat constraints that are not \ncovered by standards, e.g. the solvent for oil extraction; \n- sometimes direct injection and the heating method lead \nto different results of moisture measurement due to the \ninfluence of oil additives and ageing products [15].  \nIn addition, the Karl Fischer titration method is not a \nreal-time one, and requires appropriate chemical \ninstrumentation. It is also prone to a high level of error \nand its results are often difficult to interpret. \nA group of methods have attracted a lot of attention \nin recent years. They rely on the measurement and \nanalysis of insulation dielectric properties. This \ndiagnostics is based on the fact that paper and oil change \ntheir dielectric properties when  moisture levels increase. \nTherefore, measuring paramet ers can be the dissipation \nfactor, polarization and depolarization currents (PDC) \nand return voltages (RVM). Also, to evaluate water \ncontent in oil, polymer relative humidity/relative \nsaturation sensors are frequently used [16]. \nHowever, the majority of dielectric methods do not \ndistinguish moisture impact on an insulation aging from \nimpact of other processes. This creates a lot of confusion \nover the reliability of dielectric response methods. \nWater in a solid insulation is known to play a role of \nan ageing process catalyst. However, transformer oil in \npower transformers is polluted with refining remains, \nageing byproducts and cellulo sic particles. In aged oil, \nwater can be adsorbed by impurities, e.g. cellulose \nfibres, when the saturation level is exceeded and water \nsolubility increases [15]. \n2.2 Cellulose influence \nPaper used as an insulation material includes 85 % of \ncellulose, 3-7 % of lignin and 10 % of hemicelluloses. \nTransformer paper ages under the influence of heat, air \nand moisture and eventua lly loses all mechanical \nintegrity, with risk increasing dramatically due to \ninsulation damage [24]. \nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) and near-infrared \n(NIR) spectroscopy are used to characterize ageing of \ncellulose and assess paper insulation condition. They \ndetermine the differences in spectra of new and aged \nmaterials e.g. Ali et al. [25] studied aged cellulose and \nobtained a 0.994 correlation between the spectra and \nageing time, with an error of 95 hours prediction for \npaper samples with up to 3000 hours of ageing. \nGenerally, the methods studying cellulose in \ntransformer focus on determining its condition, although, \nbrittle paper may break away from transformer windings \nand block ducts [26]. We propose to determine cellulose \nsediment influence on transformer oil condition with the \nAE method and use obtained information to evaluate \ntransformer condition.  \n2.3 Influence of dissolved gases \nAnother detrimental eff ect which can occur in \ntransformer oil is gaseous bubbles. This phenomenon \nresults in dangerous effects, such as formation of \nvapour-filled cavities on insulation surface and in oil, \nwith dramatic decrease of ins ulation dielectric strength; \ndeimpregnation of the turn insulation. \nThe breakdown process starts with a microscopic \nbubble, an area of large distances between corpuscles, \nwhere ions or electrons can initiate avalanches. These \nmicroscopic bubbles originate from current impulses on \nan electrode. The next current impulse injects charge \ncarriers into the bubble, leading to current amplification \nand finally to breakdown [27]. \n    \n \nDOI: 10.1051/, 01008 (2017) 711301008MATEC Web of Conferences 113\n12th International  Scientific-Technical  Conference  on  Electromechanics  and  Robotics  \"Zavalishin's  Readings\"  -  2017\nmatecconf/201\n2\n \nApplying method of dissolved gas analysis (DGA) \nand taking samples of mineral oil inside transformer, we \ncan determine what gases are present and find out their \nconcentration levels. Available gases from \nchromatographic analysis of insulation oil could contain \nconcentrations of dissolved carbon monoxide (CO), \ncarbon dioxide (CO\n2), nitrogen (N 2), hydrogen (H 2), \nmethane (CH 4), acetylene (C 2H2), ethylene (C 2H4), and \nethane (C2H6) [28]. \nHalstead [29] argued that there was a relationship \nbetween fault temperature and the composition of gases \ndissolved in oil. In [30] Griffin determined key gases and \nw ha t  f a ul t s  t he s e  ga s e s  c oul d  i de nt i f y .  Z ha ng  e t  a l  [ 3 1]  \nestablished diagnostics criteria for types and amounts of \ngases in oil. Compositions of the dissolved gases, rates \nof generation, and specific content ratios can be used to \nindicate transformer condition.  \nSome artificial intelligence techniques present \ndiagnostic schemes to analyze the dissolved gas data e.g. \nH u a n g  e t .  a l .  [ 3 2 ] ,  I s l a m  e t  a l .  [ 3 3 ] ,  Z h a n g  e t .  a l  [ 3 4 ] .  \nEach of these techniques can identify a single impurity \nin transformer oil. Therefore, applying a combination of \nthese techniques to determine three impurities is \ninexpedient, requires much time, incurs financial and \nlabour costs. We propose to use the AE method to \ndetermine these impurities and their influence on \ntransformer oil condition as an indicator of transformer \ncondition. \n3 Acoustic emission method \nThe AE method has been studied for 25 years [35], in \nparticular in Poland, Brazil and Taiwan, to determine \npartial discharge impact [35-38]. Various physical \nphenomena accompany the occurrence and development \nof partial discharges (PDs) in insulation systems. They \nare chemical changes of insulation, the occurrence of the \ncurrent pulse and emission of an electromagnetic wave, \nand a percussive elastic strain with an acoustic wave \ngeneration [35]. To avoid these effects, the AE method \ncan be used. It is now a significant supplement for other \nmeasuring methods used in diagnostics of transformer \ninsulation systems, current and voltage measuring \ntransformers, power condensers and bushing insulators.   \nThe most significant merit of the AE method is the \npossibility of its application in difficult operation \nconditions. It enables detecting the PD occurrence \ntracing in power equipment operation, locating the \nplaces of PD generation in insulation systems. Therefore, \nthe AE method fills the gap in PD metrology of high-\npower equipment. Procedures of AE pulses’ measure and \nregistration are discussed in [39]. \nWe used the AE method to measure acoustic signals \ngenerated by impurities (water, cellulose, gas phrase) in \ntransformer oil and to analyze their frequency spectrum \nto acquire the information about transformer condition. \n4 Materials and methods \nAs the studied sample the transformer oil of T-750 and \nT-1500 brands was applied, the independent variables \nwere quantity of impurities in oil samples and generator \nfrequency, the dependent variable was sound wave \npower value. \nThe measurement setup consisted of a transformer \ntank filled with electro-insulating oil and impurities, two \nelectro-mechanical (piezoelectric) transducers, AE signal \ngenerator, a personal computer (PC) and designed \nsoftware. The principal scheme of acoustic signal \nprocessing is presented in Figure 2.  \n \nFig. 2. Principal scheme of acoustic signal processing: 1 - \ngenerator; 2 - piezoelectric transducers, 3 - measuring system. \nTo measure the AE pulses, a  piezoelectric transducer \nwas used, it was placed inside the tank. Its application \nmade the measurement of sinusoidal acoustic signals \npossible at amplitude characteristics in the frequency \nr a n g e  f r o m  1  k H z  t o  1 0  k H z  w i t h  a  s t e p  f r o m  2  t o  2 0  \nkHz properly. \nThe registration of the AE pulses was done with the \noriginal software compatible with a PC and, to the best \nof our knowledge, new to the field. The AE pulses \nregistered underwent the analysis in the time, frequency \nand time-frequency domains and were visualized with \nthe computer program Matlab 6.0. \nFirst, the comparison test of a new and aged \ntransformer oils was performed to check the AE method \nsensitivity. The acoustic signals of both oils were studied \nin 1-10 kHz frequency range at room temperature. \nTo determine the effect of water, cellulose, gas on \ntransformer oil condition, we added them to different \nsamples of new oil and measured the AE signals. \nWater was added to the first transformer oil sample \nwith a pipette. The mixture was weighed. Sound wave \npower was measured in 4 points, where percentage scale \nof water mass concentration in transformer oil was 0%, \n0,224%, 0,355%, 0,0994%. This range was chosen in \nview of oil hygroscopicity. Measurement error did not \nexceed 0,000496 g [40-43]. \nSimilarly, we added cellulose to the second \ntransformer oil sample. Cellulose mass concentration in \ntransformer oil being 0%, 0,06%, 0,18%, 0,31%. Gas \naddition was performed by air input through a slotter \np i p e  w i t h  t h e  s p e e d  o f  3 , 3 3  m l / s  i n  a  t a n k  w i t h  o i l  \nsample [42]. \n5 Results \nThe comparison test showed that the AE signals \nmeasured in the samples of new and aged transformer \noils were significantly different. Therefore, the content \nof impurities in transformer oil had an impact on sound \nwave power (see Fig. 3). The obtained AE signals were \nrecorded and the response characteristics of transformer \noil with impurities were represented.  \n    \n \nDOI: 10.1051/, 01008 (2017) 711301008MATEC Web of Conferences 113\n12th International  Scientific-Technical  Conference  on  Electromechanics  and  Robotics  \"Zavalishin's  Readings\"  -  2017\nmatecconf/201\n3\n \n \nFig. 3. Response characteristics of a new and aged transformer \noils: 1 new transformer oil, 2 aged transformer oil. \nThe obtained sound power vs. frequency diagrams of \noil samples with water, with cellulose and gas phrase \nwere represented in Figures 4-6 respectively. \nThe response characteristics of model oils without \nimpurities differed from the response characteristics of \noil sample with impurities. Therefore, the presence of \nimpurities influenced transformer oil condition.  \nThe effect of impurities was determined applying the \nFisher’s test. As a result, wat er and cellulose influenced \ntransformer oil quality, in con trast to gas phase. The AE \nmethod was not sensitive to determining gas phase in \ntransformer oil in the selected the frequency range. \n \nFig. 4. Response characteristics of transformer oil with water: \n1 - water 0,355%; 2 - water 0,224%; 3 - model oil (water 0%), \n4 - water 0,0994%. \n \nFig. 5. Response characteristics of transformer oil with \ncellulose: 1 - cellulose 0,06%; 2 - cellulose 0,18%; 3 - cellulose \n0,31%; 4 - model oil (cellulose 0%). \n \nFig. 6. Response characteristics of transformer oil with/without \ngas phase: 1 - gas phase presence; 2 - gas phase absence. \nApplying the regression procedure to the 2 kHz, 5 \nkHz, 8 kHz frequencies were studied to obtain a \ncorrelation between the sound wave power and water \ncontent in oil. The correlation coefficient values were \n0,96, 0,84, 0,94 for the 2 kHz, 5 kHz, 8 kHz frequencies \nrespectively. Therefore, the dependence between the \nsound wave power and water in the range from 0 to \n0,335% was established as linear which had type:  \n     Y  =  b\n0 + b1X        (1) \nDetermining the regression coefficients, for the 2 \nkHz, 5 kHz, 8 kHz frequencies the following equations \nwere obtained: \n   Y\n2 kHz = 9,94•10-9-2,76•10-8•X       (2) \n   Y 5 kHz = -4•10-8+1,22•10-6•X        (3) \n   Y 8 kHz = 8,54•10-10+4,1•10-9•X       (4) \nFigure 7 represented modal and experimental \ndependences between sound wave power and water \nconcentration for the 2 kHz frequency [44]. \n \nFig. 7. Comparison of model and experimental curves of water \ncontent for 2 kHz frequency: 1 - model dependence; 2 - \nexperimental dependence. \nS i m i l a r l y ,  t h e  1  k H z ,  1 , 6  k H z ,  5  k H z  f r e q u e n c i e s  \nwere studied to obtain a correlation between the sound \nwave power and cellulose. The correlation coefficients \nwere 0,03, 0,02 and 0,53. Therefore, this dependence \nwas not linear and had more sophisticated character. \nOur future work may include  determination of more \nsophisticated model of the correlation between the sound \n    \n \nDOI: 10.1051/, 01008 (2017) 711301008MATEC Web of Conferences 113\n12th International  Scientific-Technical  Conference  on  Electromechanics  and  Robotics  \"Zavalishin's  Readings\"  -  2017\nmatecconf/201\n4\n \nwave power and cellulose content in transformer oil and \nestablishing a gas effect on transformer oil condition.  \nCompared to other methods, the AE method had a \nnumber of advantages. For example, its possibility to \ndetermine the content of several impurities applying the \nsame equipment in field, e.g. in a substation or in a \npower station. Therefore, this method is available for \ncomplex online diagnostics. Compared to other methods \nit is simpler, cheaper, less time-consuming as we do not \nneed to transport oil samples to an equipped laboratory, \nuse sophisticated reagents, and skills.  \n6 Conclusion \nWater, cellulose and gas phase were determined as the \nmain reasons of transformer oil degradation. Various \nmethods used to determine the impact of the impurities \nwere presented in the paper. The AE method was \nhighlighted as the most perspective method for online \ncomplex diagnostics of transformer oil condition. A \ndetailed explanation of the experiments with the AE \nmethod was presented. \nTaking into account the fact that transformer oil \ncontains about 70% of the available diagnostics \ninformation, the obtained results can be important for the \nutilities which aim to reduce maintenance costs, lengthen \ntransformer’s life, increase operation safety, minimize \naccidental and severe failures of power transformers, and \nfor energy consumers who aim at reliable energy supply \nfor the low cost.  \nReferences \n1.
