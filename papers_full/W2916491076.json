  "abstract": "The paper reports on the solution, principles, and application results related to a system for diagnosing main transformers in power plants via the radiofrequency method. The subject of the diagnostics is the occurrence of partial discharge activity in transformers. The technical solution of the system is characterized in the introductory section of the article. There then follows a description of the operating principle and the implemented novel advanced methods for signal detection and source localization. The results obtained from practical application of the system within the diagnostics of high-power transformers are presented as well. Because ambient electromagnetic disturbance was recognized as a major issue during the system development, novel detection methods were proposed, implemented, and verified. The principal approach utilizes an external radiofrequency sensor to detect outer impulse disturbance and to eliminate disturbance-triggered acquisitions, and it also ensures direct real-time visualization of the desired impulse signals. The ability of weak signal detection was verified via artificial impulse signal injection into the transformer. The developed detection methods were completed with localization techniques for signal source estimation. The desired impulse signal was detected and localized during full operation of the main transformer, despite the presence of strong electromagnetic interference.",
