E-mail: yamada-shin@ks.kyorin-\nu.ac.jp\nA\nrtificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving and \ndynamic field with the potential for widespread \nuse in healthcare. ChatGPT, an AI tool developed \nby OpenAI in November 2022 (1), uses advanced \nalgorithms and machine learning techniques and has \npotential for use in many applications within the medi­\ncal field (2–4). Numerous exploratory efforts have \nalso assessed its use in evidence­based medicine (5) \nand obstetrics and gynaecology (6), identifying both \nadvantages and limitations in its use in these fields. \nThe potential application of ChatGPT in the field of \nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) should be \nexplored. PMR is a specialized field of medical prac­\ntice that focuses on improving impaired function and \npreventing secondary disorders. PMR requires multi­\ndisciplinary collaboration and communication through \na teamwork model. As coordinators, PMR clinicians \nmust possess extensive knowledge and experience to \nmanage and organize information from various special­\nties, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, \nspeech­language pathology, prosthetics and orthotics, \nnutrition, and psychology. This equips them to inte ­\ngrate information from these specialties and develop \ncomprehensive rehabilitation prescriptions. However, \nit is not known whether the integration of large langu­\nage models (LLMs) into this multidisciplinary team \nmanagement model could improve productivity in the \ncontext of rehabilitation clinical practice. Therefore, \nthe aim of this single case report study is to investigate \nJRM JRMJournal of Rehabilitation MedicineJRM Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine\nUse of artificial intelligence large language models\np. 2 of 4\nthe potential of the new AI LLM in the field of rehabi­\nlitation medicine, focusing specifically on its ability to \nfacilitate the creation of rehabilitation prescriptions and \nInternational Classification of Functioning, Disability \nand Health (ICF) codes.\nMETHODS\nA stroke case from textbook (7) was utilized for this \nqualitative evaluation. All responses were generated by \nChatGPT­4, the most advanced LLM from OpenAI, \nreleased on 15 March 2023 (1). Prompts were provid­\ned to ChatGPT ­4 to generate information based on \nthis stroke case, including medical problems, medical \nmanagement plans, rehabilitation problems, rehabilita­\ntion management plans, risk management plans, and \nrehabilitation goals. ChatGPT ­4 was also instructed \nto generate physical therapy prescriptions, and oc ­\ncupational prescriptions, and advice was sought on \nspeech­language therapy and assistive device usage. In \naddition, recommendations were requested regarding \npsychology, sociology, interpersonal relationships, and \nother relevant factors requiring intervention. Finally, \nChatGPT was instructed to generate ICF codes for the \npatient. A standard approach from the textbook (7) \nwas used for comparison. 2 licensed PMR clinicians \nreviewed the recommendations generated by ChatGPT \nand provided comments regarding each item, in order \nto facilitate further discussion.\nCase report\nA 62­year­old man presenting with sudden onset of \ndifficulty moving his left hand presented to our hospital \non foot. He was diagnosed with cerebral infarction \nin the right precentral gyrus. Prior to onset he was \nindependent in his activities of daily living (ADL) and \ngait, and lived with his wife and daughter, and worked \nin a bank. His usual work included object transferring \nwith both hands, less­frequent document writing, and \ncommuting 60 min by bus and train. He was taking \nmedication for hypertension and diabetes mellitus.\nTwo days post­onset, antiplatelet treatment was ini­\ntiated for probable thrombosis. The inpatient treatment \nand follow­up were estimated to take 2–3 weeks. When \nrehabilitation was initiated, he had a blood pressure of \n141/71 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 bpm, with no arrhyth­\nmia; motor and sensory disturbances: left hemiparesis \nwith stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS) motor \nscores (8): knee ­mouth test 4, finger Function test \n4, hip­flexion test 5, knee­extension test 5, foot­pat \ntest 5; grip strength: right 32 kg, left 19 kg; range of \nmotion of joints: no restriction; abnormal reflex: clo­\nnus –, Babinski reflex –, tendon reflexes of the patella \nand Achilles tendon, attenuated; sensory disturbance: \nthermal sensation, mildly impaired; touch sensation, \nmildly impaired; and proprioception, intact. His motor \nfunctionality was independent, and gait abnormality \nwas not observed. His balance function was intact. His \nADL were independent with self­correction (he felt \ndifficulty when lifting an object with his left hand). The \npatient wanted to return to work as early as possible.\nRESULTS\nPrompts were provided to GPT ­4 to generate infor ­\nmation based on this stroke case, including medical \nproblems, medical management plans, rehabilitation \nproblems, rehabilitation management plans, risk ma ­\nnagement plans, and rehabilitation goals (Table I, see \ndetails in Appendix S1).\nA thorough review of the standard clinical ICF code \nassigned by 2 PMR clinicians was then conducted, \ncomparing it with the table produced by the GPT ­4 \nmodel (Table II). The 3­digit codes generated by the \nLLM were accurate, aptly representing the aspects of \nfunctioning, disability, and health. No discrepancies \nwere found in the ICF code concerning the inclusion \ncriteria. Furthermore, the personal factors, which were \nnot delineated in the ICF code, were included in the \ndescription. However, an error was found when revie­\nwing the case record in the body structures category \n(s730). The patient had had a stroke, and the original \nimpairment should have been classified as affecting \nthe right precentral gyrus (s110.1), as outlined in the \ncase section. Instead, the table displayed the damage \nas being in “the upper extremity, left hand.”\nDISCUSSION\nIn this case study, ChatGPT pinpointed crucial rehabili­\ntation problems, such as motor/sensory impairment and \nADL difficulty, and formulated reasonable, yet general, \nrehabilitation prescriptions (Table I), providing ratio­\nnale to support its recommendations (Appendix S1). In \naddition, the LLM automatically generated ICF codes \n(Table II) within seconds, based on the key problems \nidentified from the patient. \nWhereas application of the ICF has the potential \nto bring ground­ breaking changes to the field of \nrehabilitation, it is time­consuming to apply, which \nhinders its widespread adoption in clinics (9). To \ntackle this issue, researchers have been working on \ndeveloping a supportive tool (10). We believe that \nthe advancement of LLM technology, exemplified \nby ChatGPT, has the potential to make application \nof the ICF more practical.\nIn this comparative study PMR clinicians identified \nerrors and inaccuracies (Table II and Appendix S1) in \nJ Rehabil Med 55, 2023\nJRM JRMJournal of Rehabilitation MedicineJRM Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine\nUse of artificial intelligence large language models\np. 3 of 4\nthe output of the LLM, which focused primarily on \nexpert judgement to optimize rehabilitative interven­\ntion. Specifically, ChatGPT demonstrated weakness in \ndetermining the chronicity of the disease and selecting \nappropriate approaches based on prognosis prediction. \nHowever, the majority of ChatGPT’s responses aligned \nwith recent rehabilitation management requirements \nfor this stroke case. These findings indicate the poten­\ntial of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, to be integrated into \nworkflow systems or education in the field of rehabili­\ntation medicine as a tool for use by human clinicians.\nIt is important to note that the stroke case mentioned \nis merely a straightforward textbook example, whereas \nreal­world clinical medicine and rehabilitation involve \nmore complex and uncertain circumstances, both \nmedically in the acute phase and holistically in the \nchronic phase. Further evaluation is required to assess \nthe ability of ChatGPT to handle intricate scenarios in \na clinical rehabilitation setting. In addition, it is crucial \nto emphasize the significance of using specific and \nappropriate prompts for generating accurate outcomes \n(Appendix S1). Clinicians must construct prompts that \nare understandable to ChatGPT when composing their \ninputs (2). Furthermore, caution must be exercised as \nlanguage models such as ChatGPT may occasionally \ngenerate “hallucinations”, resulting in nonsensical \nTable I.

Therefore, LLMs are \nnot suitable for replacing human decision­making in \nrehabilitation medical practice. \nDespite the potential of pre­trained models for vari­\nous applications, LLMs lack the ability to update their \nknowledge, as they are trained on large datasets up to \n2021, and their learning process halts once training is \ncompleted (5,6). Moreover, ChatGPT, being grounded \nin general knowledge, lacks specificity in rehabilitation \nmedicine, limiting its application in this area. To enhance \nits applicability, specific training in rehabilitation medi­\ncine may be necessary for this pre­trained LLM. \nAlthough the application of ChatGPT or other LLMs \nin rehabilitation medicine is currently at an early stage, \nwe conclude that the potential benefits are promising \nas AI technology continues to advance. \nIn conclusion, ChatGPT shows potential for  \napplications in both clinical practice and education \nwithin rehabilitation medicine. However, limitations \nsuch as lack of specificity in rehabilitation medicine, \nexist. Currently, it should not be used to replace \nthe expertise of medical professionals or independently \njudge medical issues. Future developments, such as \nspecialized models, may enhance its applicability. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported by The Education/Research \nFund of Kyorin University School of Medicine to \nZL, ST and SY , JSPS KAKENHI (grant number \nJP20K16467), The Nakatomi Foundation, The General \nInsurance Association of Japan, The Daiwa Securities \nHealth Foundation to ST.\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\nREFERENCES\n1.
