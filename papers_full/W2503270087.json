Furthermore, the number of\nparticipants in these studies has not exceeded a few hundred. To overcome these limitations, we have determined,\nin a multicenter study, the prevalence of delirium over a single day among a large population of patients admitted\nto acute and rehabilitation hospital wards in Italy.\nMethods: This is a point prevalence study (called “Delirium Day ”) including 1867 older patients (aged 65 years or\nmore) across 108 acute and 12 rehabilitation wards in Italian hospitals. Delirium was assessed on the same day in all\npatients using the 4AT, a validated and briefly administered tool which does not require training. We also collected\ndata regarding motoric subtypes of delirium, functional and nutritional status, dementia, comorbidity, medications,\nfeeding tubes, peripheral venous and urinary catheters, and physical restraints.\nResults: The mean sample age was 82.0 ± 7.5 years (58 % female). Overall, 429 patients (22.9 %) had delirium.\nHypoactive was the commonest subtype (132/344 patients, 38.5 %), followed by mixed, hyperactive, and\nnonmotoric delirium. The prevalence was highest in Neurology (28.5 %) and Geriatrics (24.7 %), lowest in\nRehabilitation (14.0 %), and intermediate in Orthopedic (20.6 %) and Internal Medicine wards (21.4 %). In a\nmultivariable logistic regression, age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.01 – 1.05), Activities of Daily\nLiving dependence (OR 1.19, 95 % CI 1.12 – 1.27), dementia (OR 3.25, 95 % CI 2.41 – 4.38), malnutrition (OR 2.01,\n95 % CI 1.29 – 3.14), and use of antipsychotics (OR 2.03, 95 % CI 1.45 – 2.82), feeding tubes (OR 2.51, 95 % CI 1.11 – 5.66),\nperipheral venous catheters (OR 1.41, 95 % CI 1.06 – 1.87), urinary catheters (OR 1.73, 95 % CI 1.30 – 2.29), and physical\nrestraints (OR 1.84, 95 % CI 1.40 – 2.40) were associated with delirium. Admission to Neurology wards was also associated\nwith delirium (OR 2.00, 95 % CI 1.29 – 3.14), while admission to other settings was not.\nConclusions: Delirium occurred in more than one out of five patients in acute and rehabilitation hospital wards.\nPrevalence was highest in Neurology and lowest in Rehabilitation divisions.

BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:106 \nDOI 10.1186/s12916-016-0649-8\nBackground\nDelirium is an acute and fluctuating disorder of attention\nand cognitive functioning, which is almost always triggered\nby underlying medical causes and is often accompanied by\nabnormal arousal and perceptual disturbances [1]. Delirium\nis associated with many adverse clinical outcomes, includ-\ning reduction of functional independence, worsening of\ncognitive performance, and increased mortality [2 – 4].\nImportantly, the mortality risk is associated with delirium\nper se, independent of the associated medical conditions,\nand is strongly related to delirium duration [2, 5]. Delir-\nium is also associated with increased costs of care, with\nmore than US$ 164 billion per year expended in the USA\nand more than 182 billion Euros per year in Europe [6, 7].\nFurthermore, delirium causes higher distress for patients,\ncaregivers, and healthcare professionals [8, 9].\nHowever, despite this burden, delirium often goes\nunrecognized, and its detection is still grossly inadequate\nin clinical practice [10 – 12]. Physicians often do not assess\nap a t i e n t’s cognition [13, 14], and even if they do, they\noften fail to recognize the importance of delirium as the\ninterface between mental and physical health [12, 15]. This\nis particularly relevant because the inability to detect delir-\nium implies an increased risk of poor outcomes for pa-\ntients [16]. Conversely, increased knowledge concerning\ndelirium might allow the staff to implement preventive in-\nterventions [17] which have been consistently shown to\nreduce the incidence of delirium in hospitalized patients\n[18, 19] and to ultimately improve their outcomes [20].\nA recent review of 35 studies published between 1990\nand 2012 reported a prevalence of delirium ranging from\n11– 42 % in acute hospitals and from 14 – 18 % in long-\nterm care and post-acute rehabilitation [4, 21, 22]. How-\never, most of these estimates refer to only a few hundred\npatients, are based on pooled results from different\nstudies carried out in single wards or hospitals [23 – 26],\nand are limited by some methodological heterogeneity.\nFurthermore, all of them have been performed using\ndiagnostic tools that require preliminary training and/or\nlongstanding experience to be used efficiently [14, 27, 28],\nwith consequent poor transferability of results to clinical\npractice. To date, only one study assessed delirium\nacross multiple wards of a tertiary hospital within a 24-\nhour period, finding an average prevalence of 20 %,\nbut, again, the diagnostic procedures to assess delirium\nwere strongly dependent on the researcher ’se x p e r t i s e\nin delirium [26].\nWe report here the first nationwide point prevalence\nstudy to assess delirium in older (i.e., aged 65 years or\nmore) patients admitted to acute and rehabilitation hos-\npital wards, using a standardized tool that requires nei-\nther longstanding experience nor a preliminary training\nof the assessors [29]. This study was a part of a larger\nsurveillance project, called “Delirium Day,” which involved\nnot only acute and rehabilitation hospital wards but also\nnursing homes, and was widely distributed across Italy.\nMethods\nDuring the 14th National Congress of the Italian Associ-\nation of Psychogeriatrics (AIP), held in Florence in 2014,\nan interdisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers\nbelonging to four Italian scientific associations (the AIP,\nthe Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics [SIGG],\nthe Italian Society of Hospital and Community Geriatrics\n[SIGOT], and the Italian Society of Neurology for Demen-\ntia [SINDEM]) discussed the current state of delirium\nknowledge among healthcare ope rators in Italy and shared\nideas on advancing the best-care practices in this field. The\nDelirium Day was the result of this collaborative effort. This\ninitiative was conceived both as a method to assess delirium\nprevalence in various settings of care and as an innovative\nproject to assess delirium to disseminate culture and aware-\nness of the issue among healthcare staff.\nBrief description of the Italian hospital care system\nThe hospital care in Italy is delivered by more than 600\npublic and more than 500 private hospitals, especially\nnot-for-profit institutions, which provide both outpatient\nand inpatient services. The number of hospital beds is\napproximately 330,000, i.e., less than 3.7 per 1000 inhab-\nitants and there are about 1.78 hospital doctors per 1000\nresident population [30]. The facilities participating in\nthis study are all part of the Italian hospital care system.\nStudy design\nThe invitation to participate in this multicenter “point\nprevalence” study was sent via email to the members of\nthe four scientific associations (globally about 5000),\nwith publication on their websites. Each member was\nalso encouraged to advertise the project and to invite\nparticipation by other facilities. Members who voluntarily\nagreed to participate were invited to send a confirmation\nemail to the following address: deliriumday2015@gmail.\ncom by 15 August 2015. No incentives were offered to\nparticipants.\nSubjects and study protocol\nSeptember 30, 2015 was the day chosen for the study\n(index day). All patients admitted to the participating\ncenters from 00:00 to 23:59 of the index day were con-\nsidered potentially eligible if they were aged 65 years and\nolder, were native Italian speakers, and if they or a proxy\nprovided a written informed consent. Exclusion criteria\nwere coma, aphasia, and end-of-life status, as defined by\nclinical judgment.\nThe assessment of the eligible patients was performed\nby the attending physicians with the following two-step\napproach.\nBellelli et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:106 Page 2 of 12\nStep 1 (mandatory for all patients) (a)Formal cognitive\nassessment: physicians assessed the eligible patients\nusing the Assessment test for delirium and cognitive\nimpairment (4AT) [29]. The 4AT has recently been\nvalidated for the assessment of delirium in patients\nadmitted to acute and rehabilitation hospital wards,\nshowing a sensitivity of 89.7 % and a specificity of\n84.1 % for delirium. Its administration is brief\n(generally less than 2 minutes), and it requires no\nspecial training, making delirium assessment feasible\nby untrained physicians or nurses. A score of 0\nsuggests neither delirium nor cognitive impairment;\nscores between 1 and 3 suggest possible general\ncognitive impairment (that is, corresponding to\nmoderate to severe impairment on standalone\ndementia screening tools), while a score of 4 or\nabove suggests likely delirium, based on the\nperformance of the 4AT in the original validation\nstudy [29]. Thus, in the present study, delirium is\ndefined as a score of 4 or more on the 4AT\ninstrument. The 4AT form is shown in Additional\nfile 1: Appendix A.\n(b)Clinical assessment: For all patients a comprehensive\nsociodemographic and medical history was collected,\nincluding date of hospital admission and functional\nstatus prior to admission, using the Activities of\nDaily Living (ADL) score [ 31] and the Charlson\ncomorbidity index [ 32]. Patients were deemed to\nhave dementia if they had documented diagnosis in\nthe medical record and/or were prescribed\nacetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-I) or\nmemantine prior to admission. Their nutritional\nstatus was evaluated referring to the time of\nassessment and classified according to clinical\njudgment of the attending physician, as “well\nnourished,”“ at risk of malnutrition, ” or\n“malnourished.” The total number of medications\ntaken by each patient on the index day and the use\nof specific pharmacological classes (i.e.,\nantihypertensives, antiplatelets, antiarrhythmics,\nstatins/lipid lowering drugs, antidiabetics, antiulcer\ndrugs, antibiotics, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics,\nantidepressants, antiepileptics, and AChE-I/meman-\ntine) were also recorded, together with the use of\nfeeding tubes (i.e., nasogastric tube [NT] or percu-\ntaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [PEG] tubes), per-\nipheral venous catheters, urinary catheters, and\nphysical restraints (vests, wrists, inguinal restraints,\nand bedrails).\nStep 2 (for patients scoring ≥4/12 on 4AT) Motor sub-\ntype of delirium: this was measured using the Delirium\nMotor Subtype Scale (DMSS) [33, 34]. The DMSS is a\nscale using 11 motor items derived from items used in\nprevious motor subtyping methods but with relative spe-\ncificity for delirium and demonstrated correlation with\nobjective measures of motor behavior, including electronic\nmotion analysis [35]. It can be rated by any healthcare\nprofessional who is familiar with patient behavior, and it\ncan be used to rate the previous 24 hours or more. Each\nof the 11 symptoms (4 hyperactive and 7 hypoactive fea-\ntures) is rated as present or absent where at least 2 symp-\ntoms must be present from either the hyperactive or\nhypoactive list to meet subtype criteria. Patients meeting\nboth hyperactive and hypoactive criteria were deemed\n“mixed subtype, ” while those meeting neither criterion\nwere deemed “no subtype” [34].\nData collection and ethical procedures\nAn electronic case report form (e-CRF) was created to\ncollect clinical data, and each center was provided with a\nusername and a password. After accessing the e-CRF,\neach clinician was asked to indicate the number of eli-\ngible patients and the number of those who accepted to\nparticipate. Then, an automatic message allowed the\nclinician to complete the data collection in the e-CRF. It\nwas not possible to submit the data form without the\nmandatory clinical data. The submission was possible\nonly after clicking on the “Finish survey ” button when\nat least the mandatory assessment was terminated. All\ntranscripts were anonymized, and none of the participants\nwas allowed to see the data of patients from other centers\nor to identify their names.\nThe Ethical Committee of the IRCCS Fondazione\nSanta Lucia, Rome (Prot CE/PROG.500) approved the\nstudy protocol. Informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants or from their next of kin when the partici-\npants were not capable of giving informed consent\nthemselves because of delirium or severe cognitive im-\npairment. Those who declined to participate in the study\nwere excluded.\nStatistical analysis\nThe descriptive analysis for quantitative variables was\nbased on calculation of the mean and standard deviation\n(SD) for parametric distribution or median and inter-\nquartile range (IQR) for nonparametric distributions,\nwhile qualitative variables were reported as frequencies\nand percentages. Comparisons between groups were per-\nformed using the one-way ANOVA or t test and the\nKruskal-Wallis test or Mann-Whitney U test for nor-\nmally and abnormally distributed data, respectively. Post\nhoc analyses were performed with the Tukey test or\nDunn test when appropriate. The categorical variables\nwere compared between groups using the chi-square\ntest, and Bonferroni corrections were used for pairwise\ncomparisons. We used univariate logistic regression ana-\nlysis to evaluate the association of variables with delirium.\nBellelli et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:106 Page 3 of 12\nVariables found to be statistically significant in the univari-\nate analysis were included in a multiple age- and gender-\nadjusted logistic regression model in order to determine\nthe factors independently associated with delirium. The\nlevel of significance was established as 95 % ( p <0 . 0 5 ) .A l l\nanalyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nA total of 161 centers responded to the invitation letter\nby sending a confirmation email; of these, 37 centers\nwere excluded because they did not collect data on the\nindex day, 2 because they recruited only one patient per\ncenter, and 2 because they included patients aged less\nthan 65 years. Overall, 108 acute and 12 rehabilitation\nhospital wards were involved in the study, of which 60\nwere located in Northern Italy (30 Geriatrics, 11 Neur-\nology, 9 Rehabilitation, 5 Orthopedics, and 5 Internal\nMedicine divisions), 40 in Central Italy (24 Geriatrics,\n5 Internal Medicine, 5 Neurology, 4 Orthopedics, and\n2 Rehabilitation divisions), and 20 in Southern Italy (8\nGeriatrics, 7 Internal Medicine, 3 Orthopedics, 1 Neur-\nology, and 1 Rehabilitation division). On the study day,\n2221 patients were eligible. Of these, 354 did not consent\nto participate, leaving a sample of 1867 patients included in\nthe study (Fig. 1). Of these, 1154 patients were from acute\nGeriatrics, 198 from Internal Medicine, 158 from Neur-\nology, 107 from Orthopedics, and 250 from Rehabilitation\nw a r d s .T h em e a na g eo ft h ew h o l es a m p l ew a s8 2 . 0 ±\n7.5 years, and 58 % were female. Four hundred twenty-nine\npatients (22.9 %) had delirium, and of those the motoric\nsubtype was characterized in 275 (64.1 %): hypoactive in\n106 patients (38.5 %), mixed in 75 (27.3 %), hyperactive in\n59 (21.5 %), and nonmotoric in 35 (12.7 %), according to\nDMSS scores.\nTable 1 shows the demographic, cognitive, functional,\nnutritional, and clinical characteristics of subjects with\nand without delirium. Those with delirium were older\nand less educated than those without. Moreover, they\nwere also more dependent in functional status, more\noften malnourished or at risk of malnutrition, and more\nfrequently affected by dementia. There was no difference\nin regard to medications taken by patients with and\nwithout delirium, except for antihypertensives, statins/\nlipid lowering drugs, antiulcer drugs, and antibiotics,\nw h i c hw e r em o r ef r e q u e n t l yp r e s e n ti nn o n d e l i r i o u s\npatients, and for antipsychotics, antidepressants, and\nAChE-I/memantine, which were more frequently present\nin delirious patients. Finally, NTs/PEG tubes, peripheral\nvenous and urinary catheters, and physical restraints were\nmore prevalent among patients with delirium than in\nthose without.\nTable 2 shows the characteristics of patients according\nto the different settings. Those in Geriatrics wards were\nthe oldest and also the most disabled and malnourished.\nPatients in Neurology wards were the youngest, the least\nmalnourished, and the most frequently affected by de-\nmentia; they also were more often treated with benzodi-\nazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiepileptics,\nand AChE-I/memantine, and least often with diuretics\nFig. 1 Disposition of participants in the study\nBellelli et al.

Patients in Orthopedic\nwards had the highest prevalence of peripheral venous\nand urinary catheter use, those in Internal Medicine\nwards had the highest antibiot ic use, and those in Rehabili-\ntation wards were the most educated and had the lowest\nfrequency of peripheral venous and urinary catheters.\nThe prevalence of delirium was highest in the Neur-\nology (28.5 %; 45/158) and Geriatrics wards (24.7 %;\n285/1154), lowest in Rehabilitation (14.0 %; 35/250), and\nintermediate in Orthopedic (20.6 %; 22/107) and Internal\nMedicine wards (21.2 %; 42/198) (Fig. 2).

Prevalence was highest in Neurology and Ge-\nriatrics and lowest in Rehabilitation hospital wards. Delir-\nium occurrence was independently associated with the\nmore elderly, ADL dependence, dementia, malnutrition,\nand use of antipsychotics, feeding tubes, peripheral venous\nand urinary catheters, and physical restraints. Moreover,\ntaking admission to Rehabilitation as a reference category,\nbeing admitted to Neurology wards was also associated\nwith delirium occurrence, wh ile admission to other set-\ntings was not.\nAlthough our findings are consistent with those of the\nexisting literature [4, 36], previous studies have assessed\nthe prevalence of delirium in a single hospital [23 – 25,\n37– 39] or at no more than three hospitals [40, 41] and/\nor involved only one type of specialist ward per study\n(i.e., only Internal Medicine, Geriatrics, or Orthopedic\nunits). Other studies conducted in Neurology and Ortho-\npedic wards have mainly focused on the incidence of delir-\nium rather than on its prevalence [4, 42 – 45], which\nexplains the lack of such data in these settings. The few\nstudies in Rehabilitation settings found a delirium preva-\nlence ranging from 13 – 18 % [21, 22], but, again, these data\nreferred to a single hospital or were combined. The results\nof the only point prevalence delirium study [26] available\nto date were similar to those of our study. Ryan and\ncolleagues included 280 patients from different wards\nof a medium-size tertiary hospital in Ireland. Using a\nset of well-validated tools, a trained team of delirium\nexperts found in this population a delirium prevalence\nof 19.6 % with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders (DSM)-I Vc r i t e r i a ,1 7 . 6%w i t ht h e\nConfusion Assessment Method (CAM), and 20.7 % with\nthe Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R98) [26].\nSeveral hospital wards were screened for delirium preva-\nlence, including Geriatrics and Internal Medicine, Oncol-\nogy and Radiotherapy, General Surgery, Neurosurgery,\nand Orthopedics [26]. However, data from some wards\nwere very limited in number, preventing the researchers\nfrom establishing a setting-specific prevalence of delirium.\nIn the present study, we achieved a large participation\nfrom Geriatric, Internal Medicine, Neurology, and Ortho-\npedic wards distributed in 18 out of 20 Italian regions,\nallowing us to obtain a representative picture of the impact\nof delirium across Italian hospitals. These data confirm that\ndelirium is not exclusive to specific healthcare settings, but\nis common in all studied hospital wards, in spite of the\nclear differences observed among patients in the different\nsettings. The highest prevalence of delirium observed in\nGeriatric and Neurology war ds might be explained by the\nhighest prevalence of risk factors for delirium: old age,\ndisability, and malnutritio n, which were most frequent\nin Geriatrics, while both dementia and use of psychotropic\nmedications were highest in Neurology wards. The inde-\npendent association between the admission to Neurology\nwards and delirium might have several explanations. Con-\nsistent with patients ’ features, the unmeasured confound-\ning of behavioral and psychological symptoms associated\nwith dementia might be more frequent in this setting. The\nFig. 2 Prevalence of delirium according to different settings\nBellelli et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:106 Page 7 of 12\npresence of such symptoms might both increase the risk\nof delirium [45] and be misdiagnosed as delirium itself,\nespecially for the features “alertness” and “fluctuating\ncourse” of the 4AT. Alternatively, a selection bias might\nbe present, with delirium cases being referred more\noften to Neurology from emergency departments.\nOverall, these findings stron gly suggest that delirium in\nacute Neurology wards should be regarded as a potential\ntarget of interest for future studies.\nThe other variables associated with delirium in the\npresent study have all been recognized as predictors in\nprevious prospective researches [4]. In particular, ac-\ncording to Inouye ’s model [46], we found that both\npredisposing (i.e., age, disability, dementia, and malnutri-\ntion) and precipitating factors (i.e., use of antipsychotics,\nfeeding tubes, peripheral venous and urinary catheters,\nand physical restraints) were associated with delirium oc-\ncurrence in the whole population, thus confirming the\nmultifactorial nature of this syndrome.\nThe frequency of the delirium motoric subtypes in our\nstudy is in keeping with previous ones carried out on\nsmaller populations [47, 48]. Because the most prevalent\ndelirium subtype was the hypoactive one, which is at\nhighest risk of underdetection [28], we also claim the\nimportance of an active case finding in clinical practice\nusing standardized tools in order to avoid misdetection.\nConversely, the hyperactive form of delirium, which is\nthe most readily recognized, was also found to be the\nleast prevalent.\nThe present study has several implications for clinicians\nand policymakers. Indeed, because delirium prevalence is\nin keeping with previous studies that used more accurate\ndiagnostic methods [4, 26], our study indirectly shows that\nmulticenter studies in this field are both feasible and reli-\nable, even with physicians untrained in the diagnosis of\ndelirium. We also pose that the use of 4AT in similar ini-\ntiatives might be an aid in the comparison of delirium\nprevalence among different healthcare settings, increasing\ndelirium awareness among healthcare providers. Finally,\nalthough a causal relationship could not be established\nin our study due to its cross-sectional design, the high\nprevalence of modifiable factors associated with delirium\n(malnutrition, antipsychotic use, feeding tubes, peripheral\nvenous and urinary catheters, and physical restraints)\nTable 3 Univariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with delirium\nUnivariate analysis Multivariate analysis\nNumber OR 95 % CI p value OR 95 % CI p value\nAge 1.07 1.05 – 1.09 <.001 1.03 1.01 – 1.05 .006\nFemale sex 180/785 .99 .80 – 1.24 .97 –– –\nEducation, years .96 .93 – .99 .008 1.00 .97 – 1.04 .77\nRehabilitation wards 35/250 Ref Ref\nGeriatrics wards 285/1154 2.02 1.38 – 2.95 <.001 1.15 .72 – 1.83 .56\nOrthopedic surgery wards 22/107 1.59 .88 – 2.87 0.12 –– –\nNeurology wards 45/158 2.45 1.49 – 4.02 <.001 2.00 1.10 – 3.64 .02\nInternal Medicine wards 42/198 1.65 1.01 – 2.71 .05 1.40 .77 – 2.57 .27\nADL (functions lost) 1.45 1.38 – 1.53 <.001 1.19 1.12 – 1.27 <.001\nDementia (yes/no) 243/465 7.16 5.64 – 9.08 <.001 3.25 2.41 – 4.38 <.001\nMalnutrition (yes/no) 58/133 2.84 1.98 – 4.08 <.001 2.01 1.29 – 3.14 .002\nAntihypertensives (yes/no) 241/1180 .68 .55 – .85 .001 .84 .64 – 1.09 .18\nStatins/lipid lowering (yes/no) 45/342 .45 0.32 – 0.63 <.001 .79 .53 – 1.17 .23\nAntibiotics (yes/no) 186/619 1.78 1.42 – 2.22 <.001 1.24 0.93 – 1.64 .14\nAntipsychotics (yes/no) 132/263 4.43 3.38 – 5.82 <.001 2.03 1.45 – 2.82 <.001\nAntidepressants (yes/no) 112/390 1.47 1.15 – 1.90 .003 1.03 .76 – 1.41 .83\nAntiulcer drugs (yes/no) 270/1250 .79 .63 – .99 .04 .86 .65 – 1.13 .27\nAChE-I/memantine (yes/no) 15/39 2.14 1.11 – 4.11 .03 .91 .42 – 1.97 .81\nFeeding tubes (NT or PEG) (yes/no) 20/40 3.47 1.85 – 6.51 <.001 2.51 1.11 – 5.66 .03\nPeripheral venous catheters (yes/no) 244/848 1.82 1.47 – 2.27 <.001 1.41 1.06 – 1.87 .02\nUrinary catheters (yes/no) 199/539 2.79 2.23 – 3.50 <.001 1.73 1.30 – 2.29 <.001\nPhysical restraints (yes/no) 268/695 3.94 3.15 – 4.94 <.001 1.84 1.40 – 2.40 <.001\nOR odds ratio, 95 % CI 95 % confidence interval, Ref reference value for the hospital wards, ADL Activities of Daily Living score, AChE-I acetylcholinesterase\ninhibitors, NT nasogastric tube, PEG percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy\nBellelli et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:106 Page 8 of 12\nsuggests that a relationship may exist between delirium\nand these factors. Hence, future studies are needed to\ninvestigate potential relati onships between these care\npractices and delirium.\nStrengths of the present study include the large sample\nand the inclusion of more than 100 healthcare facilities\nfrom different settings. A second strength is the adoption\nof a common assessment protocol based on the detection\nof delirium with the 4AT, a simple tool that requires nei-\nther preliminary training nor longstanding experience to\nbe administered. In fact, previous studies have generally\nused diagnostic instruments and/or criteria that are time-\nconsuming or difficult to implement in clinical practice\n[27, 49], which may represent potential barriers to improv-\ning delirium detection in clinical practice [13, 50].\nSome limitations of this study should be acknowledged.\nFirst, the participation in our study was on a volunteer\nbasis, and therefore ours is a convenience sample. Second,\nit might be possible that centers participating in the\npresent survey self-selected for a moderate-to-high atten-\ntion to the issue and were therefore not fully representa-\ntive of acute hospitals and rehabilitation settings in Italy.\nThird, we did not collect data regarding the main reasons\nof hospital admission, thus preventing us from assessing\nthe role of precipitating factors of delirium, such as stroke\nand infections. Fourth, it might be possible that the diag-\nnosis of dementia may have been underreported in med-\nical records and that only a percentage of people with\ndementia would have been prescribed AChE-Is or mem-\nantine, leading to dementia being underreported in our\nstudy, and consequently, some cases of dementia may\nhave been misclassified as delirium. Fifth, delirium in this\nstudy was defined with a brief assessment tool, the 4AT,\nrather than with a comprehensive reference standard. This\nwas necessary for reasons of practicality; nevertheless, the\ntool has good sensitivity and specificity for delirium in the\noriginal study and in other published studies [51, 52].\nLastly, we cannot exclude the possibility that the 4AT may\nhave at least partially overestimated the prevalence of de-\nlirium in subjects with pre-existing dementia. Indeed, in\nthe validation study, the 4AT was shown to have good\nsensitivity but lower specificity in these patients [29].\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, this is so far the largest point prevalence\nstudy of delirium on a national level, showing a prevalence\nof more than one out of five patients across different\nhospital wards. A reliable and widespread assessment of\ndelirium may be obtained through the use of a simple and\nvalidated tool, thus allowing large-scale detection of this\ntoo often unrecognized condition. We suggest that “Delir-\nium Day” might be performed in different countries and re-\npeated over time in Italy, both as a supportive educational\nstrategy to improve delirium awareness and as a potential\nbenchmarking platform to assess the quality of assistance\nprovided in different facilities.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: The 4AT test.
