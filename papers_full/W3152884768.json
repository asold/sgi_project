The code\nis available at https://github.com/\nHunter-DDM/knowledge-neurons.\n1 Introduction\nLarge-scale pretrained Transformers (Devlin et al.,\n2019; Liu et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2019; Clark\net al., 2020; Bao et al., 2020) are usually learned\nwith a language modeling objective on large-scale\ncorpora, such as Wikipedia, where exists oceans\nof factual knowledge. Pretrained language models\nnaturally play as a free-text knowledge base by pre-\ndicting texts (Bosselut et al., 2019). Petroni et al.\n(2019) and Jiang et al. (2020b) probe factual knowl-\nedge stored in pretrained language models by ﬁll-\nin-the-blank cloze queries. The evaluation shows\nthat pretrained Transformers have a strong ability\nto recall factual knowledge without any ﬁne-tuning.\nRoberts et al. (2020) use closed-book question an-\nswering to show that the larger a model is, the more\nknowledge it can store.

In this paper, we\nattempt to look deeper into pretrained Transformers\nand investigate how factual knowledge is stored.\nAs shown in Figure 1, we propose a knowl-\nedge attribution method to identify the neurons\nthat express a relational fact, where such neurons\nare named knowledge neurons. Speciﬁcally, we\nview feed-forward network (i.e., two-layer percep-\ntron) modules in Transformer as key-value memo-\nries (Geva et al., 2020). For the example in Figure 1,\nthe hidden state is fed into the ﬁrst linear layer\nand activates knowledge neurons; then, the second\nlinear layer integrates the corresponding memory\nvectors. The key-value-memory nature (Geva et al.,\n2020) inspires us to propose the knowledge attribu-\ntion method, which identiﬁes knowledge neurons\nin feed-forward networks by computing the contri-\nbution of each neuron to the knowledge prediction.\nExtensive analysis shows that the activation of\nthe identiﬁed knowledge neurons is positively cor-\nrelated to the knowledge expression, which shows\n8493\nFeed-Forward \nNetwork\nFFN(key)\nActivation\ninner product\nweighted sum\nFFN(val)\nFFN Output\nHidden State\nThe capital of Ireland is [MASK] \nSelf-Attention Layer\nFeed-Forward Network\nDublin\n… …\n… …\nKnowledge\nNeurons\n… …\n𝐿×\nFigure 2: Illustration of how an FFN module in a Transformer block works as a key-value memory.

We hypothesize that\nknowledge neurons in the FFN module are responsible for expressing factual knowledge.\nthe effectiveness of the proposed knowledge at-\ntribution method. First, suppressing and ampli-\nfying knowledge neurons notably affects the ex-\npression of the corresponding knowledge. Second,\nwe ﬁnd that knowledge neurons of a fact tend to\nbe activated more by corresponding knowledge-\nexpressing prompts. Third, given the knowledge\nneurons of a fact, the top activating prompts re-\ntrieved from open-domain texts usually express\nthe corresponding fact, while the bottom activating\nprompts do not express the correct relation.\nIn our case studies, we try to leverage knowl-\nedge neurons to explicitly edit factual knowledge\nin pretrained Transformers without any ﬁne-tuning.\nWe present two preliminary studies: updating facts,\nand erasing relations. After identifying the knowl-\nedge neurons, we perform a knowledge surgery\nfor pretrained Transformers by directly modify-\ning the corresponding parameters in feed-forward\nnetworks. Such surgery shows promising results,\nkeeping a moderate inﬂuence on other knowledge.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n• We introduce the concept of knowledge neu-\nrons and propose a knowledge attribution\nmethod to identify the knowledge neurons that\nexpress speciﬁc factual knowledge in the ﬁll-\nin-the-blank cloze task.\n• We conduct both qualitative and quantitative\nanalysis to show that knowledge neurons are\npositively correlated to knowledge expression.\n• We present preliminary studies of leveraging\nknowledge neurons to edit factual knowledge\nin Transformers, even without any ﬁne-tuning.\n2 Background: Transformer\nTransformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is one of the\nmost popular and effective NLP architectures. A\nTransformer encoder is stacked with L identical\nblocks. Each Transformer block mainly contains\ntwo modules: a self-attention module, and a feed-\nforward network (abbreviated as FFN) module. Let\nX ∈Rn×d denote the input matrix, two modules\ncan be formulated as follows:\nQh = XWQ\nh ,Kh = XWK\nh ,Vh = XWV\nh , (1)\nSelf-Atth(X) = softmax\n(\nQhKT\nh\n)\nVh, (2)\nFFN(H) = gelu (HW1) W2, (3)\nwhere WQ\nh ,WK\nh ,WV\nh ,W1,W2 are parameter ma-\ntrices; Self-Atth(X) computes a single attention\nhead; H, the hidden state, is given by projecting\nthe concatenation of all heads; gelu denotes the\nGELU activation function (Hendrycks and Gimpel,\n2016). For simplicity, we omit the scaling factor in\nself-attention and the bias terms.\nConnections Between Self-Attention and FFN\nComparing Equation (2) and Equation (3), we no-\ntice that the formula of FFN(·) is quite similar to\nSelf-Att(·), except the activation function gelu in\nFFN and softmax in self-attention. Thus, similar\nto the query-key-value mechanism in self-attention,\nit is reasonable to regard the input of the FFN as a\nquery vector, and two linear layers of the FFN as\nkeys and values, respectively. Similar observations\nare also described in (Geva et al., 2020).\n8494\n3 Identifying Knowledge Neurons\nSimilar to (Geva et al., 2020), we view FFNs in\nTransformer as key-value memories as illustrated\nin Figure 2. We hypothesize that factual knowl-\nedge is stored in FFN memories and expressed by\nknowledge neurons. In this section, we propose a\nknowledge attribution method and a reﬁning strat-\negy to identify these knowledge neurons.\n3.1 Knowledge Assessing Task\nWe employ the ﬁll-in-the-blank cloze task to assess\nwhether a pretrained model knows a fact. Follow-\ning Petroni et al. (2019), each relational fact is in\nthe form of a triplet⟨h,r,t⟩, where his the head en-\ntity, tis the tail entity, and ris the relation between\nthem. Given a fact, pretrained models answer the\ncloze query x that expresses the fact but leaves\nthe tail entity as a blank. For example, given the\nfact ⟨Ireland, capital, Dublin⟩, a pos-\nsible query is “The capital of Ireland is ”. We\nalso call the query a knowledge-expressing prompt.\nPetroni et al. (2019) describe that a model knows\na fact if it can predict the correct answer. In this\npaper, rather than just examining the model out-\nputs, we identify the speciﬁc knowledge neurons\nthat express factual knowledge.\n3.2 Knowledge Attribution\nInspired by Hao et al. (2021), we propose a knowl-\nedge attribution method based on integrated gradi-\nents (Sundararajan et al., 2017). Our method can\nevaluate the contribution of each neuron to knowl-\nedge predictions. In this paper, we examine FFN\nintermediate neurons for the masked token, where\nthe answer is predicted.\nGiven an input prompt x, we ﬁrst deﬁne the\nmodel output Px( ˆw(l)\ni ) as the probability of the\ncorrect answer predicted by a pretrained model:\nPx( ˆw(l)\ni ) = p(y∗|x,w(l)\ni = ˆw(l)\ni ), (4)\nwhere y∗denotes the correct answer; w(l)\ni denotes\nthe i-th intermediate neuron in the l-th FFN; ˆw(l)\ni\nis a given constant that w(l)\ni is assigned to.\nIn order to calculate the attribution score of a neu-\nron Attr(w(l)\ni ), we gradually change w(l)\ni from 0 to\nits original value w(l)\ni calculated by the pretrained\nmodel, and meanwhile integrate the gradients:\nAttr(w(l)\ni ) = w(l)\ni\n∫ 1\nα=0\n∂Px(αw(l)\ni )\n∂w(l)\ni\ndα, (5)\nwhere ∂Px(αw(l)\ni )\n∂w(l)\ni\ncalculates the gradient of the\nmodel output with regard to w(l)\ni . Intuitively, as\nα changes from 0 to 1, by integrating the gradi-\nents, Attr(w(l)\ni ) accumulates the output probability\nchange caused by the change of w(l)\ni . If the neuron\nhas a great inﬂuence on the expression of a fact,\nthe gradient will be salient, which in turn has large\nintegration values. Therefore, the attribution score\ncan measure the contribution of the neuron w(l)\ni to\nthe factual expressions.\nDirectly calculating continuous integrals is in-\ntractable. We instead use Riemann approxima-\ntion ˜Attr(w(l)\ni ) = w(l)\ni\nm\n∑m\nk=1\n∂Px( k\nm w(l)\ni )\n∂w(l)\ni\n, where\nm = 20 is the number of approximation steps.\nWith the attribution algorithm, we can identify a\ncoarse set of knowledge neurons whose attribution\nscores are greater than a threshold t.\n3.3 Knowledge Neuron Reﬁning\nIn order to identify knowledge neurons more accu-\nrately, we further propose a reﬁning strategy. Be-\nsides “true-positive” knowledge neurons that ex-\npress factual knowledge, the coarse set of knowl-\nedge neurons may contain “false-positive” knowl-\nedge neurons that express other information (e.g.,\nsyntactic or lexical information). The reﬁning strat-\negy aims to ﬁlter out these “false-positive” neurons.\nFor different prompts corresponding to the same\nfact, we hypothesize that they share the same set\nof “true-positive” knowledge neurons, since they\nexpress the same factual knowledge. Meanwhile,\nwe hypothesize that they do not share the “false-\npositive” knowledge neurons as long as the prompts\nare diverse enough. Therefore, given multiple\ndiverse prompts, we can reﬁne the coarse set of\nknowledge neurons by retaining only neurons that\nare widely shared among these prompts.\nSpeciﬁcally, given a relational fact, the complete\nprocess to identify its knowledge neurons is de-\nscribed as follows: (1) produce ndiverse prompts;\n(2) for each prompt, calculate the knowledge at-\ntribution scores of neurons; (3) for each prompt,\nretain the neurons with attribution scores greater\nthan the attribution thresholdt, obtaining the coarse\nset of knowledge neurons; (4) considering all the\ncoarse sets together, retain the knowledge neurons\nshared by more than p% prompts.\n8495\nRelations Template #1 Template #2 Template #3\nP176 (manufacturer) [X] is produced by [Y] [X] is a product of [Y] [Y] and its product [X]\nP463 (member_of) [X] is a member of [Y] [X] belongs to the organization of [Y] [X] is afﬁliated with [Y]\nP407 (language_of_work) [X] was written in [Y] The language of [X] is [Y] [X] was a [Y]-language work\nTable 1: Example prompt templates of three relations in PARA REL. [X] and [Y] are the placeholders for the head\nand tail entities, respectively. Owing to the page width, we show only three templates for each relation. Prompt\ntemplates in PARA REL produce 253,448 knowledge-expressing prompts in total for 27,738 relational facts.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Experimental Settings\nWe conduct experiments for BERT-base-cased (De-\nvlin et al., 2019), one of the most widely-used pre-\ntrained models. It contains 12 Transformer blocks,\nwhere the hidden size is 768 and the FFN inner\nhidden size is 3,072. Notice that our method is\nnot limited to BERT and can be easily general-\nized to other pretrained models. For each prompt,\nwe set the attribution threshold tto 0.2 times the\nmaximum attribution score. For each relation, we\ninitialize the reﬁning threshold p% (Section 3.3)\nas 0.7. Then, we increase or decrease it by 0.05\nat a time until the average number of knowledge\nneurons lies in [2, 5]. We run our experiments on\nNVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs. On average, it costs\n13.3 seconds to identify knowledge neurons for a\nrelational fact with 9 prompts.\n4.2 Dataset\nWe examine knowledge neurons through the ﬁll-\nin-the-blank cloze task based on the PARA REL\ndataset (Elazar et al., 2021). PARA REL is curated\nby experts, containing various prompt templates\nfor 38 relations from the T-REx dataset (ElSahar\net al., 2018). We show some example templates\nin Table 1. For each relational fact, we ﬁll in the\nhead entity in prompt templates and leave the tail\nentity as a blank to predict. In order to guarantee\nthe template diversity, we ﬁlter out relations with\nfewer than 4 prompt templates and ﬁnally keep\n34 relations, where each relation has 8.63 differ-\nent prompt templates on average. These prompt\ntemplates produce 253,448 knowledge-expressing\nprompts in total for 27,738 relational facts.\n4.3 Attribution Baseline\nOur baseline method takes the neuron activation\nvalue as the attribution score, i.e., Attrbase(w(l)\ni ) =\nw(l)\ni , which measures how sensitive a neuron is\nto the input. After computing attribution scores,\nwe follow the same pipeline to obtain the reﬁned\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nLayer\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\nPercentage\nFigure 3: Percentage of knowledge neurons identiﬁed\nby our method in each Transformer layer.\nType of Neurons Ours Baseline\nKnowledge neurons 4.13 3.96⋂of intra-rel. fact pairs 1.23 2.85⋂of inter-rel. fact pairs 0.09 1.92\nTable 2: Statistics of knowledge neurons. ⋂denotes\nthe intersection of knowledge neurons of fact pairs.\n“rel.” is the shorthand of relation.

For a fair comparison, we\nemploy the same method to choose the hyper-\nparameters t and p% for the baseline to ensure\nthe average number of knowledge neurons for each\nrelation lies in [2,5].\nThe method based on neuron activation is a rea-\nsonable baseline. It is motivated by FFNs’s analogy\nwith the self-attention mechanism (as described in\nSection 2), because self-attention scores are usu-\nally used as a strong attribution baseline (Kovaleva\net al., 2019; V oita et al., 2019; Hao et al., 2021).\n4.4 Statistics of Knowledge Neurons\nFigure 3 presents the layer distribution of knowl-\nedge neurons identiﬁed by our knowledge attri-\nbution method. We notice that most fact-related\nneurons are distributed in the topmost layers of pre-\ntrained Transformers. The ﬁnding also agrees with\nTenney et al. (2019) and Geva et al. (2020).\nTable 2 shows statistics of knowledge neurons.\nOn average, we identify 4.13 knowledge neurons\nfor each relational fact using our knowledge attri-\nbution method, and 3.96 using the baseline method.\n8496\nP101P103P106P108P127P1303P136P1376P138P140P1412P159P176P178P19 P190P20 P264P27 P279P30 P36 P364P37 P39 P407P413P449P463P47 P495P530P740P937\n-60%\n-50%\n-40%\n-30%\n-20%\n-10%\n0%\n10%\n20%\nCorrect Probability Change Ratio\nOurs\nBaseline\nFigure 4: Results of suppressing knowledge neurons for various relations.

Amplifying knowledge neurons increases\nthe correct probability by 31.17% on average. For the baseline, the correct probability even decreases by 1.27%.\nTheir same order of magnitude guarantees the fair-\nness of the subsequent comparisons in the paper.\nWe also compute the knowledge neuron inter-\nsection of different relational facts. Table 2 shows\nthe average number of pair-wise knowledge neu-\nron intersections. For our proposed method, (1)\nfact pairs with the same relation (intra-relation fact\npairs) share 1.23 knowledge neurons on average;\n(2) fact pairs with different relations (inter-relation\nfact pairs) share almost no knowledge neurons. In\ncontrast, for the baseline, (3) most identiﬁed neu-\nrons are shared by intra-relation fact pairs; (4) even\na substantial portion of neurons are common for\ninter-relation fact pairs. The difference in knowl-\nedge neuron intersections suggests that our method\ncan identify more exclusive knowledge neurons.\n4.5 Knowledge Neurons Affect Knowledge\nExpression\nWe investigate how much knowledge neurons can\naffect knowledge expression in Figure 4 and Fig-\nure 5. Given a relational fact, we manipulate its\nknowledge neurons in two ways: (1) suppressing\nknowledge neurons by setting their activations to\n0; (2) amplifying knowledge neurons by doubling\ntheir activations. Then, for each relation, we plot\nthe average change ratio of the probability for the\ncorrect answer, corresponding to the manipulation.\nFor comparison, we also plot the results of manipu-\nlating baseline-identiﬁed knowledge neurons.\nFigure 4 shows that suppressing knowledge\nneurons identiﬁed by our knowledge attribution\nmethod leads to a consistent decrease (29.03% on\naverage) in the correct probability. By contrast, for\nbaseline-identiﬁed neurons, the suppressing oper-\nation has a negligible inﬂuence (1.47% decrease\non average) on the correct probability. Notably, for\nthe relation P178 (developer), the correct prob-\nability abnormally increases by using the baseline.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we have similar observa-\ntions for amplifying the knowledge neurons iden-\ntiﬁed by our knowledge attribution. We see a con-\nsistent increase (31.17% on average) in the cor-\nrect probability. By contrast, the baseline even de-\ncreases the average correct probability by 1.27%.\nIn summary, the knowledge neurons identiﬁed\nby our knowledge attribution method tend to no-\ntably affect knowledge expression. Notice that the\nabove assessment is affected by the distribution of\nknowledge neurons. For example, if the knowledge\nneurons for a relation are distributed more widely,\nwe need to manipulate more top-kneurons for bet-\nter control. We use the above experiments as a\nproof of concept while leaving precise control for\nfuture work.\n8497\nRelational Facts Neurons Top-2 and Bottom-2 Activating Prompts (Average Activation)\n⟨ Ireland,\ncapital,\nDublin ⟩\nw(9)\n2141, w(10)\n1122\nTop Our trip ... in Dublin, the capital and largest city of Ireland ...

The activation of neurons iden-\ntiﬁed by our method can distinguish the knowledge-\nexpressing prompts (T1) clearly.\n4.6 Knowledge Neurons are Activated by\nKnowledge-Expressing Prompts\nIn order to study what prompts can activate knowl-\nedge neurons, we compare the average activation of\nknowledge neurons for different types of prompts.\nBING REL Dataset We build a new dataset BIN-\nGREL by crawling the Bing search engine to collect\nnew prompts, for a more extensive comparison be-\nyond the PARA REL dataset. For each of the 27,738\nfacts in PARA REL, we crawl two types of texts: (1)\nup to ten texts containing both the head and the tail\nentities (210,217 texts crawled in total); (2) up to\nten texts containing only the head entity without\nrestricting tail entities (266,020 texts crawled in\ntotal). Following the distant supervision assump-\ntion (Mintz et al., 2009), the ﬁrst type of texts tends\nto express the whole relational fact, while the sec-\nond type does not. We mask tail entities for the\nﬁrst type of texts to obtain knowledge-expressing\nprompts (T1). In order to conduct a controlled ex-\nperiment, we mask random words for the second\ntype of texts, forming a control group (T2). More-\nover, we employ randomly sampled prompts as\nanother control group (T3).\nResults As shown in Table 4, for our method,\nthe identiﬁed knowledge neurons are more signiﬁ-\ncantly activated by knowledge-expressing prompts\n(T1 = 0.485), compared with the control groups\n(T2 = 0.019 and T3 = −0.018). By contrast, for\nthe baseline, the activation of identiﬁed neurons\ncannot distinguish three types of prompts. In ad-\ndition, since our comparison is based on the web-\ncrawled BING REL dataset, we validate the general-\nization of knowledge neurons to open-domain texts\nthat are unseen in PARA REL.\nExample Prompts In Table 3, we present exam-\nple prompts that activate knowledge neurons the\nmost and the least, respectively. Given a fact, we\nﬁrst identify its knowledge neurons with our knowl-\nedge attribution method. Then, we calculate the\naverage activation of knowledge neurons for each\ncrawled prompt that contains both the head and the\ntail entities in BING REL. Finally, we demonstrate\ntwo prompts with the highest average activation\nvalues and two with the lowest (denoted as top-2\nand bottom-2 activating prompts, respectively).\nAs shown in Table 3, the top-2 activating\nprompts express exactly the corresponding rela-\ntional fact. In contrast, despite containing the\nsame head and tail entities, the bottom-2 activating\nprompts do not express the correct relation. For\nexample, although the bottom-2 activating prompts\nfor ⟨Ireland, capital, Dublin⟩express\n8498\nErased Relations Perplexity (Erased Relation) Perplexity (Other Relations)\nBefore Erasing After Erasing Before Erasing After Erasing\nP19 (place_of_birth) 1450.0 2996.0 (+106.6%) 120.3 121.6 (+1.1%)\nP27 (country_of_citizenship) 28.0 38.3 (+36.7%) 143.6 149.5 (+4.2%)\nP106 (occupation) 2279.0 5202.0 (+128.2%) 120.1 125.3 (+4.3%)\nP937 (work_location) 58.0 140.0 (+141.2%) 138.0 151.9 (+10.1%)\nTable 5: Case studies of erasing relations.

The examples\nsupport again that knowledge neurons are activated\nby corresponding knowledge-expressing prompts.\n5 Case Studies\nWe present two preliminary studies to demonstrate\nthe potential applications of knowledge neurons.\nWe use the case studies as a proof of concept while\nleaving precise fact editing for future work.\n5.1 Updating Facts\nBy leveraging knowledge neurons in pretrained\nmodels, we try to update a learned relational fact\nfrom ⟨h,r,t⟩to ⟨h,r,t′⟩.\nMethods First, we identify the knowledge neu-\nrons of ⟨h,r,t⟩. Then, we retain the knowledge\nneurons that are shared by less than 10% of intra-\nrelation facts, to reduce the inﬂuence on other\nfacts with the same relation. Finally, we directly\nmodify the corresponding value slots in FFN(val)\n(i.e., the second linear layer of FFNs; see Fig-\nure 2): FFN(val)\ni = FFN(val)\ni −λ1t + λ2t′, where\nFFN(val)\ni denotes the value slot corresponding to\nthe i-th knowledge neuron; t and t′are the word\nembeddings of tand t′, respectively; λ1 and λ2 are\nset to 1 and 8 in our experiments.\nSetup We conduct experiments on PARA REL.\nFor each relation, we randomly sample ten facts\nlearned by the pretrained model. For each fact\n⟨h,r,t⟩, we randomly choose a different entity t′\nwith the same type as t(e.g., both tand t′belong\nto city), and then update t′as the target entity.\nWe only manipulate about four top knowledge neu-\nrons as in Section 4.4. For reference purposes, we\nalso perform the same update process on the same\nnumber of random neurons.\nEvaluation Metrics We report two metrics to\nevaluate the fact updating: (1) change rate, the\nratio that the original prediction tis modiﬁed to\nanother; (2) success rate, the ratio that t′becomes\nthe top prediction. In addition, we measure the\ninﬂuence on other knowledge by the following two\nmetrics: (1) ∆intra-relation PPL, the increase of\nperplexity on the prompts with the same relation r;\n(2) ∆inter-relation PPL, the increase of perplexity\non the prompts with different relations.\nResults As shown in Table 6, the surgery of\nknowledge neurons achieves a nontrivial success\nrate for updating facts, while random neurons are\ninsufﬁcient. Moreover, we ﬁnd that such manipu-\nlation has little negative inﬂuence on other knowl-\nedge predictions. It is promising that we can\nchange very few (i.e., about four in the above exper-\niments) neurons to affect certain facts in pretrained\nTransformers. We can further improve the success\nrate by including more top knowledge neurons in\nthe update process.\n5.2 Erasing Relations\nWe explore how to leverage knowledge neurons\nto erase speciﬁc relations in pretrained Trans-\nformers. Speciﬁcally, we take four relations in\nPARA REL as examples, i.e., place_of_birth,\ncountry_of_citizenship, occupation,\nwork_location, that typically express sensi-\ntive personal information.\n8499\nMethods Given a relation r, we ﬁrst identify\nknowledge neurons for all relational facts with r.\nThen, we retain 20 knowledge neurons that appear\nmost frequently among these facts. Finally, we\nset the value slots in FFN(val) (see Figure 2) cor-\nresponding to these knowledge neurons to 0, i.e.,\nzero vectors.\nResults As shown in Table 5, we report model\nperplexity before and after knowledge erasing.\nWith the erasing operation, the perplexity of the re-\nmoved knowledge increases as expected. Moreover,\nthe model perplexity of other relations remains sim-\nilar. We argue that knowledge neurons provide a\npromising way to erase undesired knowledge with\nminimal efforts.\n6 Related Work\nProbing Knowledge in Pretrained Models\nMany pieces of previous work aim to measure\nknowledge stored in pretrained models. Petroni\net al. (2019) propose to retrieve knowledge in pre-\ntrained models (such as BERT) using cloze queries.\nTheir experiments show that BERT has a strong\nability to recall factual knowledge without any ﬁne-\ntuning. Jiang et al. (2020b) improve the cloze\nqueries with mining-based and paraphrasing-based\nmethods. Roberts et al. (2020) propose the closed-\nbook question answering to measure how much\nknowledge a pretrained model has stored in its pa-\nrameters. Elazar et al. (2021) measure and improve\nthe consistency of pretrained models with respect\nto factual knowledge prediction. Rather than exam-\nining only the model outputs, we provide an open-\nthe-black-box analysis for the knowledge neurons\nin pretrained Transformers.\nAttribution Methods In order to open the black\nboxes of deep learning models, attribution meth-\nods aim to attribute the model output to input fea-\ntures using different measures. The product of\nthe gradients (of the output with respect to input\nfeatures) and feature values is a reasonable base-\nline (Baehrens et al., 2010; Simonyan et al., 2014).\nBesides, a set of attribution methods (Shrikumar\net al., 2017; Binder et al., 2016; Zeiler and Fergus,\n2014; Springenberg et al., 2015) back-propagate\nthe ﬁnal output to input features. However, as\nstated by Sundararajan et al. (2017), none of these\nmethods can simultaneously satisfy sensitivity and\nimplementation invariance, two fundamental ax-\nioms. Taking the axioms as guidance, Sundarara-\njan et al. (2017) propose the integrated gradient\nmethod. Our knowledge attribution method is built\nupon integrated gradients.\nAnalysis of Transformer As one of the most\npopular and effective NLP architectures, Trans-\nformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) has attracted ex-\ntensive studies. Most previous work focuses on\nthe self-attention module (V oita et al., 2019; Clark\net al., 2019; Vig and Belinkov, 2019; Hao et al.,\n2021). Recently, Wu et al. (2019) and Dong et al.\n(2021) have pointed out that the feed-forward net-\nwork module also matters to Transformer. Geva\net al. (2020) attempt to connect feed-forward net-\nworks with key-value memories by qualitative anal-\nysis. In this paper, we identify and analyze knowl-\nedge neurons in feed-forward networks for given\nfactual knowledge. Moreover, we present how to\nleverage knowledge neurons to explicitly edit fac-\ntual knowledge stored in pretrained Transformers.\n7 Conclusion and Future Directions\nWe propose an attribution method to identify knowl-\nedge neurons that express factual knowledge in pre-\ntrained Transformers. We ﬁnd that suppressing or\namplifying the activation of knowledge neurons\ncan accordingly affect the strength of knowledge\nexpression. Moreover, quantitative and qualitative\nanalysis on open-domain texts shows that knowl-\nedge neurons tend to be activated by the corre-\nsponding knowledge-expressing prompts. In addi-\ntion, we present two preliminary case studies that\nattempt to utilize knowledge neurons to update or\nerase knowledge in pretrained Transformers.\nDespite the effectiveness of identifying knowl-\nedge neurons, our current studies still have limita-\ntions. First, we examine knowledge neurons based\non the ﬁll-in-the-blank cloze task, while knowl-\nedge can be expressed in a more implicit way. It is\nan open question whether Transformer can utilize\nstored knowledge in a generalized way, such as for\nreasoning. The interactions between knowledge\nneurons also remain under explored. Second, we\nfocus on factual knowledge for ease of evaluation,\neven though our method is also applicable for other\ntypes of knowledge. Third, we use the single-word\nblank in cloze queries for simplicity, which requires\nmulti-word extensions (Jiang et al., 2020a). Be-\nsides, an interesting future direction is to ﬁgure out\nhow knowledge neurons work in multilingual pre-\ntrained Transformers (Conneau and Lample, 2019;\nConneau et al., 2020; Chi et al., 2021).\n8500\n8 Acknowledgement\nDamai Dai, Zhifang Sui, and Baobao Chang are\nsupported by the National Key Research and De-\nvelopment Program of China 2020AAA0106701\nand NSFC project U19A2065.\nReferences\nDavid Baehrens, Timon Schroeter, Stefan Harmel-\ning, Motoaki Kawanabe, Katja Hansen, and Klaus-\nRobert Müller. 2010.
