The \ninnovative Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) \ndevices have been proposed during the last three \ndecades for improving transient stability of power \nsystems (Barbuy et al ., 2009). There are various forms \nof FACTS devices such as Static Synchronous Series \nCompensator (SSSC), Static Synchronous Compensator \n(STATCOM), Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) \nand Inter line Power Flow Controller (Bhownick et al ., \n2009; Hannan et al ., 2009; Magaji and Mutafa, 2009; \nZhang, 2003; Leon and Zanetta, 2008; Parimi  et al ., \n2008; Azbe and Mihalic, 2008).  \n A Thyristor Controlled Phase Shifter Transformer \n(TCPST) consists of a shunt transformer, a series \ntransformer and a converter. The classification of \nTCPPS depends on the type of converter used. The \nconverter can be of ac-ac bridge type, Pulse-Width \nModulation  (PWM)  type,  ac controller type (Badran \net al ., 2008; Daut et al ., 2006). To verify the capability \nof TCPST on transient stability improvement, its \nsuitable mathematical model and control strategy are \nneeded to be presented.  \n This study presents the mathematical model of \npower system equipped with a TCPST. The presented \nmathematical model is applied to design control \nstrategy of a TCPST. The simulation results are tested \non a Single Machine Infinite bus system.  \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nMathematical model:  Figure 1a shows the schematic \ndiagram of the Thyristor Controlled Phase Shifter \n(TCPS). The series transformer injects the voltage in \nseries in the system. The active and reactive power \ninjected by the series transformer is taken from the \nshunt transformer. For sake simplicity of analysis, the \ninsignificant losses from transformer and converter is \nneglected. Thus the net complex power (real and \nreactive power) exchange between the TCPS and the \nsystem is zero. The injection of this complex power \ndepends on the injection of a series voltage controlled \nby a converter.  \n Figure 1b shows the equivalent circuit of Fig. 1a. \nV\ns and Vsh  are represented by the synchronous voltage \nsources in series and shunt, respectively. Xsh  is the \nleakage reactance of the shunt transformer. sX ′ is the \nleakage reactance seen from primary side of series \ntransformer is given by \n2\ns s sh X X n X ′= +  where n is the \nturn ratio number of the shunt transformer and Xs is the \nleakage reactance of the series transformer.   \nAm.

A shunt injected current \nis composed of in phase current (Ip) and in quadrature \ncurrent (Iq) which respect to the Vm . Thus Ish  is given by:  \n \nmj\nsh p q I (I jI )e θ= −   (1) \n \n Consider the single machine infinite bus system \nequipped with a TCPS at bus m as shown in Fig. 2a and \n2b shows the equivalent circuit of Fig. 2a. Note that X\n1 \nis the sum of generator transient reactance, transformer \nleakage reactance and equivalent reactance of line 1 and \n2; X2 is the equivalent reactance of sX ′, line 3 and 4. \nThe complex power injected by the series transformer \ncan be written as: \n \n*\n* m s 2 \ns s \n2\nV V E S V ( I) V jX \ns\n  − + + = − =   \n  \n  (2) \n \n(a) \n \n \n(b) \n \nFig. 2: A simple single machine infinite bus system \nwith a TCPST; (a) single line diagram; (b) \nequivalent circuit \n \n The active (P\ns) and reactive (Qs) powers injected \nby the series transformer are given by:  \n \ns s \ns m s m s 2 s \nP [S ] \nbV V sin( ) bV E sin( ) θ θ θ \n= ℜ \n= − −  (3) \n \ns s \n2\ns m s m s s 2 s \nQ [S ] \nbV V cos( ) bV bV E cos( ) θ θ θ \n= ℑ \n= − − + + \n  (4) \n \n Here b = 1/X \n2.

The range of α  depends on the type of \nTCPST. Now let the rage of α  is π α π − ≤ ≤ . Figure 3 \nshows the phasor diagram of a series injected voltage \nand shunt injected current. \n Thus in phase current as given Eq. 8 is written as: \n \np m 2 m I abV sin( ) abE sin( ) α θ α = − + +   (9) \n \n Similarly, the balancing of reactive power \nexchange is given by: \n \ns sh Q Q =  (10) \n \n Thus the in quadrature current of a shunt current \ninjection (I\nq) can be written as: \n \n2\nq m m 2 m I abV cos a bV abE cos( ) α θ α = − − +  (11) \n \n The series injected voltage V\ns with X2 of Fig. 2b \ncan be transformed into   the  current Is as  shown in \nFig. 4a.  \n The value of I\ns is given by:  \n \nmj( 90) s\ns m \n2\nVI aV be jX \nθ α + − = =  (12) \n \n The current source connected between bus m and \nthe infinite bus can be replaced by two shunt current \nsource as shown in Fig. 4b.

It indicates that the voltage \nand the angle at bus m can be controlled by a series \ninjected voltage. The electrical output power of \ngenerator (P\ne) is given by:  \n \n1 m \ne 1 m \n1\nE V P sin( ) X δ θ = −   (21) \n \n The generator dynamics, in classical model of \nsystem, can be represented by following two first order \ndifferential equation: \n \nδ ω =ɺ   (22) \n \n[ ]m e \n1 P P Mω = − ɺ   (23) \n \n Here δ, ω , P\nm , Pe and M are the rotor angle, speed, \ninput mechanical power, output electrical power and \ninertia,  respectively,  of  the  generator.  Solving the \nEq. 22 and 23 yields the variation of δ and ω  that can \nbe used to study the dynamic behavior of the generator. \nEquation 23 clearly indicates that the output electrical \npower (Pe) of the generator is the main factor that \ndictates the dynamic behavior of the generator because \nboth Pm  and H are usually considered as constant. The \nproposed model of the TCPST indicates clearly that the \nV m  can be controlled by a series injected voltage. Thus \nthis proposed model of the TCPST is very easy to \nimplement it to study its behavior on transient stability \nimprovement of the simple system. However, the \nTCPST can help the system improve transient stability \nof the system when a series injected voltage is properly \ncontrolled. Thus the control strategy of a TCPST should \nbe carefully designed. \n \nControl strategy: This study uses the machine speed \ncontrol parameters on a TCPST. When the speed \ndeviation is positive ( ω >0), the P\ne is raised by \ncontrolling parameters on TCPST; When the speed \ndeviation is negative ( ω <0), the P\ne is raised by \ncontrolling parameters on TCPST. \n \nRESULTS \n \n The presented mathematical model and control strategy \nis used to study the effect of TCPST on transient \nstability improvement of the system of Fig. 3. In all \ncases, it is considered that a three phase self clearing \nfault appears at bus m and the fault is cleared without \nchanging the network configuration. Figure 5 shows the \nswing curve of the system without a TCPST for \nclearing time (t\ncl ) = 144 msec. Figure 6 shows the \nswings curve of the system with and without an TCPST \nfor tcl = 145 m sec. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n From the results in Fig. 5 and 6, we found that \nthe critical clearing time of the system without a \nTCPST is144-145 msec. It can be seen from the Fig. 5 \nthat with fault clearing time (t\ncl ) = 144, the system is \nconsidered as stable and the system is considered as \nunstable  with  tcl   =  145  msec as can been in Fig. 6. \n \n \n \nFig. 5: Rotor  angle of the system without TCPST for \nt\ncl  = 144 msec \nAm. J. Applied Sci., 7 (11): 1495-1499, 2010 \n \n1499 \n  \n  \n \nFig. 6: Rotor angle of the system without and with an \nTCPST for t\ncl  = 145 msec   \n \nHowever, the system with a TCPST control can \nstabilize the system with t\ncl  = 145 msec. The simulation \nresults indicate that a TCPST can improve stability of \nthe system. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n This study investigates the capability of the \nThyristor Controlled Phase Shifter Transformer \n(TCPST) on transient stability improvement of the \nsystem. The mathematical model is systematically \nderived. The presented mathematical model has shown \nthat power flow and stability of system can be regulated \nby TCPST. This study uses machine speed to control \nparameters on TCPST. The speed deviation is the main \nfactor to decrease and increase power flow of the \nsystem. The simulation results are tested on Single \nMachine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system. From the \nsimulation results, it indicates that a TCPST can \nimprove transient stability of the system. \n \nREFERENCES \n  \nAzbe, V. and R. Mihalic, 2008.
