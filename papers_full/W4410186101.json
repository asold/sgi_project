This integration is facilitated by advancements in\nemerging technologies and their interplay such as artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), distributed\nledger technologies (DLT), the internet of things (IoT), extended reality (XR), and quantum\ncomputing (QC). The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) deﬁnes Web\n4.0 as the anticipated evolution of the internet, building upon the decentralized Web 3.0 and\nemphasizing applications such as the fully automated, long-distance initiation and control\nof actions (ISO, 2017). Although the concept of Web 4.0 is still in its early stages, with most\nenterprises still focused on adapting to and realizing the potential of dezentralization\npresented by Web 3.0, the European Commission presents its strategic vision for Web\n4.0 highlighting transformative potentials of the beforementioned technologies.

It focuses on empowered\nhuman-machine interactions altering commerce and societal\nstructures, while protecting people’s rights and economic growth\n(EU4Digital, 2024; European Commission, 2023). Similarly, the\nWeb4Hub presents a Web 4.0 deﬁnition that adds the use “of\nadvanced artiﬁcial and ambient intelligence, the internet of things,\nand trusted blockchain transactions to enable truly intuitive, immersive\nexperiences” (Web4Hub, 2024). According to Zhou et al., the advanced\nuse of AI agents– as distinctive entities in the network– is the biggest\ndifferentiator compared to the service-only AI applications in Web 3.0\n(Zhou et al., 2023).\nWhile the global Web 4.0 and virtual worlds market is projected\nto grow from $27 billion in 2022 to over $800 billion by 2030\n(European Commission, 2025 ), the integration of Web\n4.0 applications still brings forth numeours challenges,\nparticularly related to the integration of AI agents capable of\noperating within decentralized infrastructures ( La Roche et al.,\n2025; Zhou et al., 2023). AI agents play a pivotal role in enabling\nnetwork intelligence but still require a network evolution of\nintegrated computing and networking nodes with decentralized\ncontrollers. Key issues therefore include ensuring interoperability,\nmaintaining security, and developing robust governance\nframeworks (Gürpinar et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2023). In light of\nthese developments, this paper addresses the following question:\nWhich foundational layers enable Web 4.0 and facilitate the\ndeployment of autonomous AI agents within decentralized\nenterprise networks?\nTo explore this question, the paper explores the\nfollowing sections:\n Web 4.0 foundational layers: This section introduces a layered\nframework detailing the infrastructural, behavioral, and\ngovernance dimensions essential for enabling autonomous AI\nagents within decentralized ecosystems.\n Web 4.0 enterprise readiness: This section examines critical\nconsiderations for enterprises aiming to integrate Web\n4.0 applications into their networks, focusing on strategic\nadoption, risk mitigation, and alignment with relevant regulations.\n Discussion, conclusion, and future outlook: This section\nsynthesizes the insights from the previous sections,\ndiscussing the ﬁndings and offering recommendations and\nfuture outlooks on the integration of Web 4.0 applications in\nenterprise contexts.\nBy providing a comprehensive analysis of the frameworks and\nkey considerations for Web 4.0, this paper aims to contribute to the\ndiscourse on effectively harnessing the potential of autonomous AI\nagents within decentralized enterprise environments.\n2 Web 4.0 characteristics enabling AI\nagents in decentralized systems\nUnlike previous iterations of the web, Web 4.0 emphasizes\ninteroperability, intelligent automation, and immersive human-\nmachine collaboration, allowing AI agents to initiate and execute\ncomplex transactions along human team members (Dennis et al.,\n2023). A key enabler of this transformation is the integration of AI\nand DLT infrastructures to provide a trustless environment for AI\nagents to interact securely. These technologies should work in\ntandem to enhance autonomy, transparency, and security as\ncrucial elements for systems coordinating multi-agent and\nhuman teams.\nThis section explores (and visualizes inFigure 1) the essential\ncharacteristics of Web 4.0 that empower AI agents, highlighting\nhow decentralization, adva nced knowledge systems, and\nseamless machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions create an\necosystem where intelligent agents can function ef ﬁciently\nwhile maintaining alignment wit h ethical, legal, and economic\nconsiderations ( Almeida, 2017 ; Gürpinar et al., 2022 ;\nHawlitschek et al., 2018; Trausan-Matu, 2020 ). The framework\nserves as a conceptual suggestion for progressing toward the\nhighest governance layer, where AI agents operate on DLT and\nevolve into self-governing DAOs with natural language-based\nbrain-computer interfaces enabling direct human interaction.\nThe environmental layer forms the foundation of Web 4.0,\nintegrating physical and digital worlds to create an ecosystem\nwhere autonomous AI agents can operate effectively. The\nexpansion of decentralized AI systems and blockchain\nnetworks brings energy demand s, highlighting the need for\nenergy-ef ﬁcient solutions ( Grünewald et al., 2024 ). Without\nsustainable energy strategies, the large deployment of AI\nagents in decentralized environments may become both\neconomically and environment ally unfeasible. At the same\ntime, IoT sensors, edge computin g ,a n de x t e n d e dr e a l i t y( X R )\nplay a critical role in gatheringand processing data, enabling AI\nagents to perceive, interpret, and respond to real-world\nconditions ( Dennis et al., 2023 ; Küpeli and Gürpinar, 2023 ).\nTo fully realize Web 4.0, its underlying economic structures must\nevolve to accommodate AI-driven decentralized commerce and\ndigital labor economies. AI agents will increasingly participate in\nautonomous transactions, su pply chain optimization, and\ndecentralized ﬁnance (DeFi), shifting away from traditional\neconomic models toward self-e xecuting smart contracts and\ntokenized economic i nteractions. For thi s transformation, it\nwill be crucial to reduce reliance on intermediaries while\nensuring transparency, fairness in and regulatory compliance\nof AI-powered business ecosystems. It should be noted that AI-\ndriven decision-making in d ecentralized environments\nintroduces new risks related t o accountability, bias, and\nlegality, necessitating clear guidelines on how AI agents can\nautonomously transact and interact. Regulatory frameworks,\ntherefore, have to evolve in tandem with technological\nadvancements, providing clarity on data privacy, liability, and\nalgorithmic developments or changes.\nThe infrastructure layer forms the backbone for autonomous AI\nagents in decentralized ecosystems. As agents become more\nsophisticated, they require signiﬁcant computational power and\ndata storage to process vast amounts of real-time information\n(Hwang, 2018). DLT, storage solutions, and edge devices will be\nnecessary to support AI workloads while reducing latency.\nInnovations such as neuromorphic computing and quantum-\nresistant cryptographic hardware could further enhance the\nefﬁciency and security of these networks (Liu et al., 2023). Peer-\nFrontiers inBlockchain frontiersin.org02\nGürpinar 10.3389/fbloc.2025.1591907\nto-peer (P2P) networks eliminate central points of failure, allowing\nAI agents to communicate and transact without intermediaries.\nConsensus mechanisms and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), play\ntheir role in maintaining data integrity, ensuring transaction\nvalidity, and enhancing privacy while optimizing computational\nefﬁciency. Additionally, cross-chain interoperability protocols and\nstandards are essential to enable AI agents to interact across multiple\nnetworks, facilitating exchanges of data and value while relying on\nveriﬁable digital identities to authenticate and negotiate, and\ntransact autonomously (Wasserman, 2023).\nThe data and knowledge layer allows agents to access and\nexchange information securely, fostering collaborative\nintelligence without reliance on centralized authorities.\nResearch into decentralized AI l earning, including federated\nand swarm learning, is essentia l as these methods enable AI\nagents to be trained on distributed datasets while preserving\nprivacy and ensuring that no single entity controls the ﬂow of\nknowledge ( Abdulrahman et al., 2021 ; Zhu et al., 2023 ).\nDecentralized markets will faci litate AI-to-AI transactions,\nallowing agents to negotiate, execute contracts, and provide\nservices in a trustless manner . Establishing mechanisms for\nverifying AI reasoning, account ability, and ethical compliance\nwill be critical to maintaining trust. On-chain knowledge\nvalidation frameworks can help assess AI-generated insights,\nwhile zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic attestations\ncan ensure data integrity without exposing sensitive\nFIGURE 1\nWeb 4.0 characteristics enabling AI agents in decentralized systems.

Furthermore, aligning decentralized AI models with\nhuman values and governance f rameworks will be crucial to\npreventing bias, misinformation, and unintended\nconsequences in AI decision-making.\nThe agent, behavioral, and governance layers deﬁne how AI\nagents operate autonomously, interact with humans, and\nparticipate in larger governance structures, ensuring a functional\nand ethically aligned decentralized system. At the agent layer, AI\nagents act as independent economic and decision-making entities\ncapable of interacting and transacting with other agents,\nrepresenting and negotiating on behalf of users or organizations,\nand executing smart contracts to automate agreements without\nintermediaries. These agents must be equipped with adaptive\nlearning models, secure identity frameworks, and the ability to\nverify and enforce contractual obligations in a decentralized\nsetting. The behavioral layer extends agent capabilities by\nintegrating human-AI interactions through natural language\ncommunication, transparent learning, and ethical decision-\nmaking frameworks. AI agents must learn, adapt, and maintain\ntransparency to gain trust and adoption. They must also align their\nactions with ethical and economic principles, ensuring they\ncontribute positively to digital and real-world economies\nwithout reinforcing biases or engaging in harmful activities\n(Real de Oliveira and Rodrigues, 2021). At the governance layer,\nAI agents function as self-governing decentralized autonomous\norganizations (DAOs) or collaborate in multi-agent systems,\ninteracting with digital twins to optimize complex systems. This\nlayer ensures that AI-driven ecosystems remain coordinated,\ncompliant, and scalable by embedding governance mechanisms\nthat allow agents to self-regulate or collectively make decisions.\nAdditionally, advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCI)\nwill enable direct human-agent interaction, opening new frontiers\nfor AI-enhanced cognition and decision-making.\nTogether, these layers charac terize a Web 4.0 ecosystem,\nwhere AI agents autonomously engage in decentralized\neconomic and governance str uctures while maintaining\nalignment with human values and societal objectives. Building\non this foundation, the next section shifts focus to the practical\nconsiderations enterprises must address when integrating and\nleveraging Web 4.0 applications.\nFIGURE 2\nGuidelines for integrating web 4.0 application into enterprises. Own graphic.\nFrontiers inBlockchain frontiersin.org04\nGürpinar 10.3389/fbloc.2025.1591907\n3 Guidelines for integrating Web\n4.0 application into enterprises\nIn this section, guidelines are presented and summarized in\nFigure 2for enterprises seeking to adopt Web 4.0 applications and\nintegrating autonomous AI agents in a decentralized manner. These\nguidelines are structured across two core dimensions: foundational,\ninfrastructure, and trust, as well as autonomy, interaction, and\ngovernance. Each dimension plays a critical role in ensuring that\nenterprises can harness the full potential of Web 4.0 while navigating\nthe complexities of decentralized AI deployment.\nThe foundational, infrastructure, and trust dimension\nemphasizes the importance of creating a robust technical and\nregulatory environment that supports the operation of\nautonomous AI agents. This includes the development of a\nreliable infrastructure for data and computing resources, as well\nas establishing trust frameworks that ensure transparency,\naccountability, and security (Grosse et al., 2021). Enterprises need\nto focus on ensuring that the underlying technological layers, such as\ndecentralized hardware and communication protocols, are designed\nto operate seamlessly while adhering to legal standards and\ncompliance requirements. A clear, consistent approach to trust-\nbuilding within the decentralized network will be essential,\nespecially as autonomous agents begin to interact and transact\nwithin complex, open systems (Gillespie et al., 2023).\nOn the other hand, the autonomy, interaction, and governance\ndimension focuses on the role of AI agents in autonomous decision-\nmaking, their ability to engage in decentralized governance, and\ntheir interactions within enterprise networks. Autonomous AI\nagents need to operate independently yet in alignment with\nhuman values, legal regulations, and organizational goals.\nFurthermore, enterprises must ensure that agents can effectively\ninteract with each other and with human stakeholders through\nintuitive interfaces, including natural language processing and\ntransparent communication methods ( Chen et al., 2024 ). Web\n4.0 enables DAOs and facilitates interactions with digital twins,\nwhich necessitate new governance frameworks that support both AI\nand human-led decision-making processes.\nIn the center of this Web 4.0 ecosystem lies the enterprise\nnetwork, which consists of multiple stakeholders, each\ncontributing to and interacting with the shared system. These\nstakeholders are interconnected through the ﬂow of products,\ninformation, and ﬁnancial transactions, which must be efﬁciently\nmanaged to ensure smooth operations (Düdder et al., 2021). Web\n4.0’s decentralized nature allows theseﬂows to occur autonomously,\nreducing the reliance on traditional intermediaries and increasing\noverall efﬁciency. However, to make this a reality, enterprises must\nadopt the proper strategies to ensure that these complex interactions\nare transparent, ethical, and aligned with long-term objectives.\n4 Conclusion\nIn summary, this paper outlines the critical characteristics of\nWeb 4.0 that enable the deployment of autonomous AI agents\nwithin decentralized systems. It explores the foundational,\ninfrastructure, and trust dimensions that provide the necessary\ntechnical and regulatory environment, as well as the autonomy,\ninteraction, and governance dimensions that ensure effective\noperation and collaboration among agents within enterprise\nnetworks. By addressing these dimensions, enterprises can build\nrobust, decentralized ecosystems that leverage AI agents for efﬁcient,\ntransparent, and ethical decision-making. Looking ahead, the\ncontinued evolution of Web 4.0 technologies will require further\nresearch in all presented dimensions, particularly in scalable\nsolutions for decentralization, enhanced trust mechanisms, and\nnovel governance structures to ensure that autonomous AI agents\noperate in alignment with human values. As enterprises navigate\nthese advancements, they will play a key role in shaping the future of\ndecentralized AI-driven ecosystems, creating new opportunities for\ninnovation and collaboration across industries.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in\nthe article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed\nto the corresponding author.\nAuthor contributions\nTG: Writing – original draft, Writing– review and editing.\nFunding\nThe author(s) declare that noﬁnancial support was received for\nthe research and/or publication of this article.\nConﬂict of interest\nThe author declares that the research was conducted in the\nabsence of any commercial orﬁnancial relationships that could be\nconstrued as a potential conﬂict of interest.\nGenerative AI statement\nThe authors declare that no Generative AI was used in the\ncreation of this manuscript.\nPublisher’s note\nAll claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors\nand do not necessarily represent those of their af ﬁliated\norganizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the\nreviewers.
