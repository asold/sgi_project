  "abstract": "Threaded joints are key components of core drilling tools. Currently, core drilling tools generally adopt the thread structure designed by the API Spec 7-1 standard. However, fractures easily occur in this thread structure due to high stress concentrations, resulting in downhole accidents. In this paper, according to the needs of large-diameter core drilling, a core barrel joint was designed with an outer diameter of Φ135 mm and a trapezoidal thread profile. Subsequently, a three-dimensional simulation model of the joint was established. The influence of the external load, connection state and thread structure on the stress distribution in the joint was analyzed through simulations, from which the optimal thread structure was determined. Finally, a connection test was carried out on the threaded joint. The stress distribution in the joint thread was indirectly studied by analyzing gas leaks (i.e., the sealing effect) under axial tension. According to the test data and the simulation results, the final joint thread structure was optimized, which lays a good foundation for the design of a core barrel.",
