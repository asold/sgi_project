Yet this prime\nuse of language involves rapid switching between comprehension and production at a\nrate implying that these processes must sometimes overlap. Decades of experimentation\nhave shown that the language production system has latencies of around 600 ms and up\nfor encoding a new word (reviewed in Section 6.3) but the gaps between turns average\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\naround 200 ms (see Section 5). This would seem to imply that\nparticipants planning to respond are already encoding their\nresponses while the incoming turn from the other speaker\nis still unﬁnished. This in turn implies potentially long-range\nprediction in comprehension. Asketch modelof the interleaving\nof comprehension and production processes is presented in\nSection7.\nTo appreciate the full nature of this puzzle, it is essential\nto review what we know about the turn-taking system and its\ntemporal properties. In Section 2, we review the foundational\nSacks et al. (1974; henceforth SSJ) model of turn-taking,\nconsidering alternative proposals in Sections 3 and 4. The\nmodel proposes extensive prediction (or ‘projection’) of turn-\nends, and an expectation of swift response. The systematicity\nof turn-taking and its temporal patterning are borne out\nby extensive corpus analyses (Section 5). We then turn\nto the psycholinguistic literature (Section 6), noting that\nsensitivity to turn-end cues is already shown early in child\ndevelopment. We point out that there is considerable evidence\nfor predictive language comprehension, and for long latencies in\nlanguage production, so that the central psycholinguistic puzzle\n(Section 6.5) posed by turn-taking seems to be resolved by\npredicting what the other interlocutor is going to say. Some\ndirect recent investigations seem to bear this out (Section 6.4),\na l t h o u g he x p e r i m e n t a t i o ni nt h i sﬁ e l di si ni t si n f a n c y .I n\nSection 7 we take stock of the recent ﬁndings, and sketch a\nprocessing model addressing some of the processing puzzles\ninvolved.\n2. Turn-Taking as a System: Research\nfrom Conversation Analysis\nSacks et al. (1974; SSJ) initiated the modern literature on\nconversational turn-taking by outlining how this behavior\nconstitutes a system of social interaction with speciﬁc properties.\nIt is not organized in advance (by say an order of speaking,\nor set units to be uttered), but is highly ﬂexible, allowing for\nlonger units when so mutually arranged, and organizing an\nindeterminate number of participants into a single conversation.\nThe authors note that “overwhelmingly one speaker talks at\na time. Occurrences of more than one speaker at a time are\ncommon but brief [... ] Transitions (from one turn to the\nnext) with no gap and no overlap are common, and together\nwith slight gaps and slight overlaps make up the majority\nof transitions” (Sacks et al., 1974, p. 700). Obviously, such\nturn-taking behavior contrasts with the absence of turn-taking\nin cheering, heckling, laughing, etc. That things could be\notherwise in the speech domain is shown by the contrasting\nspeech exchange systems we also use, as in lectures where\nquestions come at the end, or in a press conference where\nquestions come from many parties but are answered by one,\ncontrasting with a classroom where questions may come from\nthe teacher alone, and may be answered by many volunteers.\nThe importance of the conversational system is that, unlike the\nothers, it appears to be the default mode of language use, as\ns h o w nb yi t so p e r a t i o ni nt h ec o n t e x to fl a n g u a g el e a r n i n g ,\nand among friends and family. As far as we know, it operates\nin a strongly universal way (cf. Stivers et al., 2009, 2010 ),\nwhile the other speech exchange systems are mostly culture-\nspeciﬁc.\nSacks et al.(1974) argued that conversation is an elemental\npiece of social organization, regulated by social norms that\nprescribe one speaker at a time but allow open participation.\nThe model they suggested consists of turn units and rules\nthat operate over those units. The units they suggested are\nvariable sizes of syntactic units, whose functions as full\nturns can be indicated prosodically. The end of such a unit\nconstitutes a ‘transition relevance place’ or TRP. The rules\nspecify:\n(1) If the current speaker C selects the next speaker N, then\nC must stop, and N should start. (‘Selection’ could involve\naddress terms, gaze, or in the case of dyadic conversation\ndefaultstothe other.)\n(2) If C does not select N, than any participant can self-select,\nﬁrst startergaining rights tothatnext unit.\n(3) Ifnootherpartyself-selects,Cmaycontinue.\nTheserulesthenrecursively applyateachTRP.\nThese rules predict that intra-speaker silent gaps (generated\nby rule 3) will be longer than inter-speaker ones, a fact shown\nto be correct on large samples of conversation [ ten Bosch\net al., 2005 report gaps between continuations by the same\nspeaker to be about 140 ms (c. 25%) longer than the average\ngap in turn transitions between diﬀerent speakers]. It has also\nbeen suggested that on this basis a turn-taking ‘beat’ or ‘clock’\n(with a period between 80 and 180 ms) can be discerned,\nsuggesting a model of coupled oscillators that allow participants\nto synch (Wilson and Zimmerman, 1986; Wilson and Wilson,\n2005).\nIt was evident to Sacks et al. (1974) that the model had\nconsequences for language processing. They noted that, given\nthat interlocutors may be addressed at any point, the system\nenforces obligate listening. More importantly, they noted that\nthe speed of speaker transition would require ‘projection’\n(prediction) of the end of the incoming turn, and production\nprocesses would have to begin before the end of the incoming\nturn, in part because turn beginnings have to be designed to\nfacilitate that very projection (Sacks et al., 1974, 719;Levinson,\n2013). Later corpus studies have established, as we shall see\n(see Section 4), that the great proportion of turn transitions\nfall between−100 and 500 ms, that is, between a short stretch\nof overlap to a gap with a duration equivalent to one to three\nsyllables.\nThere is a great deal of later work in conversation analysis\n(CA) that has contributed to our understanding of this system\n(seeClayman,2013;\nDrew,2013;Hayashi,2013 for overviews).It\nis important to appreciate that not all overlapping of turns can\nbe understood as behavior that violates the rules above – some\nauthors (see Section 4) have seen the frequency of overlap as\nundercutting the Sacks et al.(1974)m o d e l .Sacks et al.(1974)\nclaimed that overlaps are common, but usually very short, and\noftenaccountedforbylittleadditionstotheﬁrstturnlikeaddress\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nforms or tags [as in (1)], or by misanalyses of when the turn is\ncoming to an end [as in (2) where ‘biscuits’ was projected as the\nturn-end but it was followed by ‘and cheese’; overlap indicated\nwith squarebrackets]:\n(1) Sacksetal.

In these cases one or the\nother of the speakers normally drops out (impressionistic gap\ndurationinsecondsbetweenbrackets):\n(3) Hayashi,2013,p.176(from AutoDiscussion)\n(1)Curt: Mmm\nI’dl\niket’geta,h\n igh oneifIcou\n :ld.\n(2) (0.7)\n(3) Gary:–> [I know uh-]\n(4) Mike:–> [Lemmeask]aguyatwork. He’sgotta bunch\na’ old clu[nkers.\nWhen there is competition to maintain the ﬂoor in these\nand other cases, this is often negotiated on a syllable by syllable\nbasis, with e.g., deceleration, increase of intensity, and repeated\nsyllables or words, until one speaker drops out ( Schegloﬀ,\n2000).\nJust as diﬀerent kinds of overlap can be discerned, so can\ndiﬀerent kinds of absence of speech, diﬀerentiating between\npauses (e.g., between units by the same speaker), gaps (between\nspeakers), silences (meaningful absence of speech, e.g., after a\nquestion), and lapses (where no-one has self-selected to speak).\nIt has been suggested (citations below) that participants are\nvery sensitive to timing, so that an excessively long gap after\na question, for instance, may be taken to indicate that the\nrecipient has some kind of problem with it, for example ﬁnding\nit diﬃcult to answer in the aﬃrmative, or has uncertainty about\nthe response. In the following a telephone caller takes gap of\naround 2 s to indicate the answer ‘no,’ which he himself then\npre-emptivelyprovides:\n(4) Levinson,1983,p. 320\nC: So I was wondering would you be in your oﬃce on\nMonday (.)by anychance?\n(2.0 s)\nC: Probably not.\nA considerable body of work has gone into understanding\nthe role of extended gaps or silences in ‘dispreferred’ responses\n(responses not in line with the suggested action in the prior\nturn; see Pomerantz and Heritage, 2013 for review). Corpus\nanalysis shows that gaps of 700 ms or more are associated\nwith dispreferred actions, and that gaps longer than the norm\n(>300 ms) decrease the likelihood of an unqualiﬁed acceptance,\nand increase the likelihood that a response, be it acceptance\nor rejection, will have a dispreferred turn format (e.g., Yes,\nbut... in the cases of acceptances;Kendrick and Torreira, 2015).\nExperimental work also shows that gaps of 600 ms or longer\ngenerateinferencesofthisunwelcomekind( Robertsetal.,2011 ).\nThe CA approach to turn-taking raises two major issues. The\nﬁrst is what exactly counts as a turn, and how participants can\nrecognize such a unit as complete. The problem is that just\nabout any word or phrase may in context constitute a turn,\nwhile syntactic units can be nested or conjoined indeﬁnitely.\nRegarding this issue,Sacks et al.(1974, p. 721) note that “some\nunderstanding of sound production (i.e., phonology, intonation,\netc.) is also very important to turn-taking organization.” Thus\nin the following (drawn from the discussion inClayman, 2013,\np. 155), the terminal intonation contours do not occur till the\nend of the turns, and two turns each composed of three possibly\ncompletesyntacticunits(dividedby§)occuruninterrupted(note\nthe whole is recognized by the recipient as a story under way,\nhence the continuers, which are themselves possibly elicited by\nrising intonation markedwith ‘?’):\n(5) FordandThompson (1996, p.151)\nK:Vera(.) wastalking §on thephone §toher mom?\n(6) C:mmhm\nK:Anduhshegotoﬀ §thephone §andshewas\nincredibly upset?\nC:Mmhm.\nInadditiontosyntacticandpros odiccompleteness,pragmatic\ncompleteness may be required to terminate a turn (Ford and\nThompson, 1996; Levinson, 2013). Clearly a responsive action\nfollowing the ﬁrst part of a pair of actions like questions and\nanswers, oﬀers and acceptances, requests and compliances can\nbe inspected for pragmatic eﬃcacy; elsewhere the larger role in\nasequenceofspeechactsmayneedtobesatisﬁed.\nThe second major issue is ‘projection’ or predictive language\nunderstanding. Sacks et al.\n(1974) thought it clear that the turn-\ntaking system can only work if there is extensive prediction in\ncomprehension, so that recipients can use the unfolding turn to\nproject an overall syntactic and prosodic envelope which would\nallow them to foresee when and how a turn would come to\nan end (seeClayman, 2013 for a review). It is not at all clear\nhow this works, given the ﬂexibility and extendibility of most\nsyntactic units. Still, interesting insights are provided by such\nphenomena asturn-completion by the other, studiedin depth by\nLerner (1991, 2002;s e ea l s oHayashi, 2013). A typical example is\nwhereabi-clausalstructureisbegunbyspeakerA,andthesecond\nclause completed by speaker B as below.

An Alternative Signaling Approach\nThe term ‘turn-taking’ was independently suggested byYngve\n(1970)and Duncan(1972).Contemporaneouswiththeapproach\nby Sacks et al. (1974), Duncan (1972, 1974) proposed, using\nvideotapes of dialogs, a set of turn-taking signals. The main\nset are turn-handing-over signals, and consists of half a dozen\ncues: prosodic (type of ﬁnal intonation, ﬁnal syllable duration,\nﬁnal drop in pitch, or loudness), gestural (end of a gesture), and\nlexical/syntactic (tag, clause end, etc.). A second proposed signal\nis turn-maintaining and consists of a ﬁnal mid-tone, continuing\ngesture or a gaze switch away. Turns followed by speaker change\nwerefound tonearly alwaysoccur with oneor moreturn-ending\ncues. On this basis, Duncan advanced a model where the turn-\ntakingsystemisentirelyunderthecontrolofthecurrentspeaker.\nThis contrasts with the CA model, where speaker transition is\ncontingently achievedbyonespeakercomingtotheendofaunit\nand another starting (e.g., by self-selection). In addition, in the\nCAmodeltherearenocontext-freesignals:e.g.,inEnglish,aﬁnal\nmid tone usually marks turn-holding, but in speciﬁc contexts\nit may indicate turn-yielding (as when the conjunctionor is\nappended to polar questions, e.g.,Are you leaving, or... ?); thus\nturn-taking can only be achieved on some much more global\nunderstanding of theincoming turn.\nAlthoughthesignalingviewislargelysuperseded,theresearch\ndrew attention to (a) the importance of visual cues, and (b)\nthe coincidence of turn transitions with a number of features\nof turn construction, prosody, gesture, etc.Kendon (1967)h a d\nearlierdescribeddiﬀerentpatternsofgazebetweenspeakers(who\nalternately look away and look to addressees) and addressees\n(whogazelongeratthespeaker).

Challenges to the Standard Model\nRecentlyanalternativeviewtothe Sacksetal. (1974)accountwas\nadvanced byHeldner and Edlund(2010), who argue that turn-\ntaking does not have all of the systematic properties described\nby Sacks et al.(1974). First, they ﬁnd fault with the claim that\nspeakers aim at no gap and no overlap. Actual zero gaps (under\n10ms)represent lessthan 1%of transitions andoverlapsaverage\n40% of transitions in their corpora. “From these observations,\nwe conclude that the target with respect to timing of turn-taking\ncannot be one-speaker-at-a-time and no-gap–no-overlap, and\nfurthermore that precision timing in turn-taking can neither be\nused in arguments in favor of projection, nor against reaction\nas models of timing in turn-taking” (Heldner and Edlund, 2010,\np.567).Webelievetheseconclusionsaremisguided,andspellout\nthereasons here.\nFirst,atargetof10msprecision maynotberealisticofhuman\nperformance. Voiceless stops in English average between 60 and\n80 ms (Crystal and House, 1988; Byrd, 1993), and at the end\nof a turn will be hard to distinguish from the beginning of the\ngap. Perceptual “no gap” was always estimated by conversation\nanalyststobeoftheorderof150–250ms(i.e.,closetothespeaker\ntransition mode; Schegloﬀ, 2000).

Below we\nprovide a quantitative study of overlap (Overlap), which shows\nthat overlaps tend tobe minimal in size and occupy lessthan 5%\nofthespeechstream.\nMeanwhile, the argument that there is no target to avoid\noverlapseemsunlikely.Qualitativeanalysisshows,asmentioned,\nthat when overlap occurs, one speaker tends to rapidly drop out\n[asin example(3) above] sothat the bulkof overlapsareof short\nduration. ‘Interruption’ is a sanctionable breach of social mores,\nas everychild learns. The systematicproperties of all the corpora\nthat have been studied would be entirely diﬀerent if overlap was\nnot avoided.\nOn the basis of their dismissal of the no-gap–no-overlap\ntarget, Heldner and Edlund (2010, p. 566) go on to attack\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nfurther aspects of the standard model: “Thus, the no-gap–\nno-overlap principle ( Sacks et al., 1974 )c a nn e i t h e rb e\nused as a part of an argument in favor of projection nor\nagainst reaction simply because the no-gap–no-overlap cases\nhardly ever occur in real speaker change data. Importantly,\nthis means that a principal motivation for projection in\nturn-taking is invalid.” This attack on projection as a\ncentral element of the model will prove misplaced when\nwe turn to consider the psycholinguistic evidence below (in\nfact Heldner and Edlund, 2010 , p. 566 later concede that\nprojection of content may be responsible for overlaps and short\ngaps).\nThe central plank of the dismissal of projection is that turn-\ntaking is often not as rapid as has been claimed.Heldner and\nEdlund(2010, p.563)note:\n“Thecumulativedistributionabovethe200msthresholdwasalso\nof interest, as it represented the cases where reaction to cessation\nof speech might be relevant given published minimal reaction\ntimes for spoken utterances (Fry, 1975; Izdebski and Shipp,\n1978; Shipp et al., 1984). The distribution above this threshold\nrepresented 41–45% of all between-speaker intervals. These cases\nwerethuspotentiallylongenough tobereactionstothecessation\nof speech, or even more so to some prosodic information just\nbefore thesilence.”\nTherearetwoseparateproposals here.Theﬁrstisthatforgaps\nlonger than 200 ms, participants might simply react to silence.\nThis threshold is implausible. First, silence will only become\nrecognizable as silence after c. 200 ms (after all the duration of\nv o i c e l e s ss t o pc o n s o n a n t sr a n g e su pt o1 8 0m s ;c f .Heldner and\nEdlund,2010),atwhichpoint itwillstilltakeafurther minimally\n200mstoreact(so400msintotal) .Thatminimalreactionisfora\nprepared vowel(Fry, 1975), and anymore complex response will\nincrease according to Hick’s Law (see below); a choice between\noneoftwopreparedresponsestakes350msforexample.Wenow\nhave, say, 550 ms from actual cessation of speech till beginning\nof a minimal response, and asHeldner and Edlund(2010)n o t e\n70–82%ofresponses arewithin 500ms.Thusreaction tosilence,\nalthoughcertainlypossibleinaminorityofcases,wouldnotseem\nto play a major role in the organization of turn-taking (seeRiest\netal.,2015 ).\nThe second proposal is that there is the possibility of reaction\nto“someprosodicinformationjustbeforethesilence.”Herethere\nis less room for disagreement; CA practitioners and associated\nphoneticians have themselves emphasized the role of turn-ﬁnal\nintonational and segmental cues(seeWalker, 2013for a review).\nDuncan drew attention to turn-keeping intonation cues and\nlengthened (‘drawled’) syllables. Critical here are two factors:\n(a) it must be shown not only (as Duncan did) that there are\navailable prosodic/phonetic features of turn-ends, but also that\nparticipants actually use them,(b) the location of the features\nwith respect to the turn end is important (e.g., sentence accents\nin English sometimes occur well before turn ends, in which case\ntalk of projection suits better than talk of reaction to terminal\ncues, cf. Wells and Macfarlane, 1998). Bögels and Torreira\n(in press) provide experimental evidence that listeners do use\nturn-ﬁnal prosodic information (located in the last syllable of\nthe utterance) to identify turn ends in Dutch questions with\nﬁnal rising intonation. Further research should investigate other\nlinguistic contexts.\nAnother notion that has some currency is that turn-taking\ncould be driven by coupled oscillators (Wilson and Wilson,\n2005). Coupled oscillators have been shown to play a role in\ncoordination in the animal world, e.g., in the synchronization of\nﬁre-ﬂyﬂashingwhereanindividual’sﬂashesresettheneighboring\nﬁreﬂies’ oscillators, so gradually converging on a single beat.\nHowever, it is well known that human synchronization does not\nprimarily work in this way, but rather by means of temporal\nestimation, which is easily shown by demonstrating that humans\ncan tap together without waiting to hear the others’ taps\n(Buck and Buck, 1976). Moreover, given the highly variable\nlengths of turns, nothing like the ﬁreﬂy mechanism can work\nin conversation. Indeed, human coordination in general relies\non simulating the other’s task, thus on high-level cognition\n(Sebanz and Knoblich, 2008). There is, however, room for\na low level metronome, as it were, and Wilson and Wilson\n(2005) suggest that readiness to speak is governed by the\nsyllable, so that participant A’s beginning of a syllable tends\nto coincide with B’s least readiness to speak, while the end\nof the syllable coincides with B’s increased readiness. There is\nindeed some evidence for entrainment or accommodation of\nthe gap size between speciﬁc dyads, but there is no such eﬀect\non intra-turn pauses (ten Bosch et al., 2005) suggesting that\nturn-transition timing is rather unconnected to other temporal\nproperties of speaking, although more research is required\nhere.\nCareful observers have convinced themselves that such a\n‘beat’ is set up in English conversation by stress-timing, such\nthat interlocutors producing unmarked actions with their turns\ntend to come in ‘on the beat’ (Couper-Kuhlen, 2009). However,\nthe perceived rhythm of speech does not appear to have direct\nacoustic correlates, and to date we are unable to objectively\nconﬁrmtheseobservations(notetoothatlanguagesdiﬀerintheir\nrhythmic properties). Interestingly, recent corpus measurements\nshow that, rather than the entrainment of a conversational beat,\nthere is a reverse correlation of speaker A’s speech rate and\nspeaker B’s response timing, perhaps because B has less time\nto plan her message as A’s speech rate increases, and vice versa\n(Roberts etal.,2015).\n5. Statistical Studies of Corpora\nThe statistical study of turn-taking began early, prompted by\ndevelopments in telephony, with a special interest in the speed\nof turn-transition (e.g., Norwine and Murphy, 1938). It has\nbecome standard to represent overlaps and gaps on a single\ntime scale [sometimes called ‘the ﬂoor transfer oﬀset’ (FTO)] in\nwhich positive values correspond to gaps, and negative values\nrepresent overlap.Table 1summarizes average values of FTOs\nin ten languages as reported in four studies (caveat: codings and\nmethods diﬀer somewhat in these studies). Note that although\nmeanvaluesvary,theydosoinnarrowwindow,roughlyaquarter\nof a second either side of the cross-linguistic mean, and that\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nTABLE 1 | Average ﬂoor transfer offsets (FTOs) in ten different languages\nas reported by four different studies.\nLanguage Average FTO (ms) Source\nEnglish 410 Norwine and Murphy(1938)∗\nEnglish 480 Sellen (1995)∗\nEnglish 460 Sellen (1995)\nDutch −78 De Ruiter et al.(2006)∗\nJapanese 7 Stivers et al.(2009)\nTzeltal 67 Stivers et al.(2009)\nYélî-Dnye 71 Stivers et al.(2009)\nDutch 108 Stivers et al.(2009)\nKorean 182 Stivers et al.(2009)\nEnglish 236 Stivers et al.(2009)\nItalian 309 Stivers et al.(2009)\nLao 419 Stivers et al.(2009)\nDanish 468 Stivers et al.(2009)\n¯Akhoe Hai|| om 423 Stivers et al.(2009)\n∗No eye-contact between conversation participants.\nthe factors aﬀecting response times are uniform across cultures\n(Stivers et al., 2009). In the following two sections, we look in\nmoredetail atthe distribution ofgapsandoverlaps.\n5.1. Distribution of Gaps\nAbout half a century ago,Brady (1968) reported average gap\ndurations of 345–456 ms and medians from 264 to 347 ms\n(depending on the threshold used in the automatic detection of\nspeech) in a corpus of sixteen telephone calls between friends\nin the USA. Task-oriented interaction shows surprisingly similar\npatterns [e.g.,Verbmobil –a travelscheduling task bytelephone,\nhas geometric means of 380 ms (English), 363 ms (German),\n389 ms (Japanese);Weilhammer and Rabold, 2003]. In a wide\nreview, Heldner and Edlund (2010) looked at three diﬀerent\ncorpora, automatically processing two of them for speaker\ntransitions: aDutchdialogcorpus, andEnglishandSwedishMap\nTasks(where interlocutors mustadjusttheir positions on slightly\nmismatching maps). The ﬁrst two corpora included both face-\nto-face and non-face-to-face interaction. Heldner and Edlund\n(2010) found closely matching patterns across corpora, with\ncombined scale (FTO) modes for speaker transition at c. 200 ms\n(i.e., a short gap) and c. 60% of transitions being gaps, 40%\noverlaps (including any overlapof greater than 10ms; the modal\noverlap is less than 50 ms in the Spoken Dutch Corpus). Around\n41–45% of gaps were longer than 200 ms, and between 70 and\n82%ofalltransitions wereshorter than 500ms.\nThese quantitative approaches generalize over all kinds of\nspeech acts and responses. But there is also growing work\nfocused speciﬁcally on question–answer timings. Question–\nanswer sequences are an interesting context to examine, because\nquestions make a ﬂoor transfer relevant, whereas in other\ncontexts a ﬂoor transfer between speakers is often optional.\nStivers et al. (2009) looked at 10 languages from around the\nworld, including smaller, unwritten languages, and found rather\nfast transitions in polar question contexts, with means between\n7 and 468 ms, and modes from 0 to 200 ms. The coding of this\nsample was from videotape and included early visual responses\n(e.g., nods) and audible pre-utterance inbreaths. The general\nﬁnding was that although languagesdiﬀer, e.g., in their degreeof\nuse of visual modality or mean response times, the factors that\nspeeded or slowed response times (e.g., gaze, agreement) were\nshared.Heldner(2011) shows that estimatesof the percentage of\nperceived overlaps and gaps in this sample match closely other\nquantitative samples.\nThe intensive study of turn-taking under diﬀerent conditions\nis still in its infancy. We know that responses to Wh-questions\nare slower than polar (yes–no) questions cross-linguistically\n(unpublisheddatafromthe Stiversetal.,2009 study),presumably\nbecauseofthegreater cognitivecomplexity ofresponseinvolved.\nLonger answers can also be shown to take more preparation,\nreﬂected in both reaction times, and breathing preparation\n(Torreira et al., 2015). Complexity of response has also been\nshown to inﬂuence timings in children’s responses (Casillas,\n2014). We also know that individuals tend to accommodate to\nthe gap-length of others, so that when changing conversational\npartners, individuals’ response times change to match their new\ninterlocutors (ten Bosch et al., 2004, 2005). And intriguingly,\ntransition speeds are higher on the phone than face-to-face\n(Levinson,1983;tenBoschetal.,2005 ).\n5.2. Overlap\nIn contrast to gaps, the study of overlap in corpora has provided\nonly gross facts. As mentioned, Heldner and Edlund (2010)\nreportc.40%ofspeaker-transitionsinvolvingoverlaps(including\nany overlap of greater than 10 ms). Their histogram makes clear\nt h a tt h em o d a lo v e r l a pi sl e s st h a n5 0m si nt h eS p o k e nD u t c h\nCorpus, with a mean−610 ms, and median−470 ms.ten Bosch\net al. (2005) report that the proportion of overlaps increases\nfrom 44% in face-to-face conversation to 52% in telephone\nconversation, withmalesmorelikelytooverlaptheirinterlocutor\nthan females, but looking just at the transition from speaker\nA to speaker B, 80% of transitions are gaps and 20% partial\noverlaps in face-to-face conversation (the corresponding ﬁgures\nfortelephonyare73and27%).\nBecause of the lack of detailed statistical analysis of overlaps\nin corpora, we have undertaken a new analysis of overlaps\nin the Switchboard Corpus of English telephone conversations\n(Godfreyetal.,1992 ).Weaddressthe following questions:\n(1) In running speech, how common is overlap (i.e.,\nsimultaneous talk by more than one party at a time)\ncompared totalk byone party alone?\n(2) In ﬂoor transfers, how common are overlaps compared to\ngaps?\n(3) What is the distribution of overlap duration, and where do\noverlapstendto start relativetothe interlocutor’s turn?\n(4) What is the distribution of diﬀerent overlap types (cf.\nJeﬀerson, 1986)?\n5.2.1. Method\nWe analyzed a subset of 348 conversations (totaling around\n38 h of dyadic conversation) that were free of timing errors,\nand with annotations included in the NXT-Switchboard Corpus\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nrelease (Calhoun et al., 2010). To estimate the occurrence of\noverlaps in this dataset, we usedthe operationalization scheme\nin Heldner and Edlund (2010). First, based on the phonetic\nsegmentation ofthecorpus, wedividedeachspeaker’ssignalinto\ninterpausal units (IPUs) delimited by silent intervals of 180 ms\nor more. The 50,510 IPUs had an average duration of 1680 ms,\nand a median duration of 1227 ms. Second, we deﬁnedgaps,\npauses, between-overlaps, and within-overlaps as follows. Gaps\n(n = 14648) corresponded to portions of the stereo signal that\ncontained silence in each speaker’s channel, and that involved\na ﬂoor transfer between the two speakers. Between-overlaps\n(n = 6524) were ﬂoor transfers that occurred without a silent\ngap between the speakers, whereas within-overlaps (n = 3343)\nwere parts of the signal with overlapping inter-pausal units that\ndid not result in an eﬀective ﬂoor transfer. Figure 1 below\nillustrates the operationalization of gaps, between-overlaps and\nwithin-overlaps.\n5.2.2. Findings\nThe recordings were divided as follows: 77% of the signal\ncorresponded to speech by one speaker only, 19.2% to silence\n(i.e., either pauses within a speaker’s turn or gaps as deﬁned\nabove), and only 3.8% to simultaneous speech by both speakers\n(eitherbetween-overlapsorwithin-overlaps). Ifweexcludesilent\nparts, 95.3% of the speech signal corresponded to speech by\none speaker. This seems to ﬁt well with Sacks and colleagues’\nobservation that “overwhelmingly, one party speaks at a time”\n(Sacks etal.,1974,p.700).\nWith regard to how common overlaps are in terms of\nproportion of turn-transitions,Figure 2 shows the distribution\nof the duration of gaps andbetween-overlaps combined together\nas FTOs (i.e., with positive values for gaps and negative\nvalues for between-overlaps). Between-overlaps (negative FTOs)\nrepresented 30.1% of all ﬂoor transfers. As for the duration of\noverlaps, and their location within the interlocutor’s turn, we\nobserved that between-overlaps exhibited a distribution highly\nskewed to the left, with an estimated modal duration of 96 ms,\na median of 205 ms, a mean of 275 ms, and with 75% of the\ndata with values below 374 ms. Within-overlaps tended to start\nclose to the beginning of the utterances that they overlapped,\nwith a modal oﬀset of 350 ms, a median of 389 ms, a mean of\n447 ms, and 75% of the data exhibiting oﬀsets below 532 ms.\nFIGURE 2 | Histogram of ﬂoor transfer offsets (FTOs) in the\nSwitchboard Corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992; Calhoun et al., 2010,s e e\nSection 5.2.1 for details).Each bin has a size of 100 ms.\nTheirdurationexhibitedadistributionhighlyskewedtotheright,\nwithanestimatedmodaldurationof350ms,amedianof389ms,\nameanof447ms,and75%ofthedatawithvaluesbelow532ms.\nThe duration of within-overlapsis thus usually shorter than that\no ft w os y l l a b l e s .T h i sa p p e a r st oﬁ tw e l lw i t hSacks et al.’s (1974)\nobservationthat“occurrencesofmorethanonespeakeratatime\narecommon, butbrief.”\nWe now examine the distribution of diﬀerent types of\noverlaps. A prediction made by theSacks et al.(1974)m o d e l\nis that most overlaps should be occasioned by a number of\ncircumstances emerging from the application of its rules. For\ninstance: (i) Overlaps often arise when unforeseen additions\nto the ﬁrst speaker’s turn after a transition relevance place\n(e.g., during increments or tags); (ii) They may occur after a\nsilencewhentwospeakersmayself-selectandlauncharticulation\nwithout realizing that another party is doing the same thing\n(cf. ‘blind spot’ cases,Jeﬀerson, 1986); (iii) They may frequently\narise in cases involving backchannels signaling feedback to the\nFIGURE 1 | Illustration of gaps, within-overlaps, and between-overlaps for two speakers (SPK1 and SPK2) in our classiﬁcation scheme following\nHeldner and Edlund(2010).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nmainspeaker(e.g., yeah,right)andotherminimalutterancesthat\ndo not constitute an attempt to take the ﬂoor. TheSacks et al.\n(1974) model also predicts signs of overlap avoidance when it\noccurs, for instance by speakers’ abandoning their turns without\nreaching a point of turn completion. Another sign of speakers’\nspecial orientation to overlapping talk is that they mayengagein\ncompetition for the ﬂoor, for instance by repeating syllables or\nwords, often with increased intensity and pitch levels (Schegloﬀ,\n2000).\nToestimatetheprevalenceofsuchpossiblecausalcontextsfor\noverlap,inaseparateanalysiswerandomlysampled100between-\noverlaps and 100 within-overlaps from our data, and annotated\nthemforanumberofrelevantfeatures,including(a)thepresence\nof a backchannel orbrief token ofagreement(e.g.,yeah,right)i n\neither the overlapped or overlapping utterance, (b) the presence\nof a period of silence within 200 ms from the beginning of the\noverlap period, (c) the presence of a transition relevance place\n(a point of syntactic, prosodic and pragmatic completion) in the\noverlapped turn within the 500 ms leading to the overlap, (d)\nan abandoned (i.e., syntactically and prosodically incomplete)\nutterance by any of the two speakers during or immediately\nfollowing the overlap interval, and (e) the presence of repeated\nsyllables or words in any of the two speaker’s utterances during\nor immediately following the overlap interval. Other recurrent\nfeatures observed during or close to the overlap interval, such as\nlaughteranddisﬂuencies,werealsoannotated.\nTable 2showsthe mostfrequent featuresobservedin thedata\n(note that the features are not mutually exclusive). Interestingly,\nthe majority of overlap cases (73%) involved a backchannel.\nBackchannels, especially continuers like “mm hm” or “uh huh,”\narenotconstruedasfullturns,butratherpassuptheopportunity\nto take a turn, and are thus principled intrusions into the other’s\nspeech (Schegloﬀ, 2000). It should be noted that, in half of the\nbetween-overlaps, it was not the backchannel that incurred the\noverlap, but rather the main speaker who produced an utterance\nin overlap with the backchannel. We also noted that overlapping\nTABLE 2 | Frequency of seven features in a subset of 200 cases of overlap\n(100 between-overlaps, and 100 within-overlaps) extracted from our\nSwitchboard data.\nBetween-\noverlaps\n(n = 100)\nWithin-overlaps\n(n = 100)\nPercentage in\ntotal\n(n = 200)\nBackchannel or\nagreement present\n74 72 73%\nFollows TRP (<500 ms) 23 51 37%\nFollows silence\n(simultaneous start)\n21 37 29%\nAbandoned turn 21 18 19.5%\nFollows disﬂuency in\ninterlocutor’s turn\n4 18 11%\nRepeated syllables or\nwords\n41 2 8 %\nAny of the six features\nabove\n93 97 95%\nNote that observations can exhibit more than one feature at the same time (e.g.,\ncases of overlap after a period of silence involving a backchannel.\nbackchannels often occurred after a TRP or a period of silence,\nsuggesting that their timing is sensitive to speciﬁc cues in the\nmainspeaker’sturn(cf. GravanoandHirschberg, 2009).\nThe second most common feature (37%) was the presence\nof a possible transition-relevance place (i.e., a point of syntactic,\nintonational, and pragmatic turn completion) in the overlapped\nturn within a time window of 500 ms before the start of the\noverlap. Another common feature was a period of silence (29%).\nIn cases with this feature, one of the two speakers produced an\nutterancebrieﬂyafterherinterlocutor.Thesecasesofteninvolved\na backchannel (n = 35, or 60%), or resulted in one of the two\nspeakers abandoning their turn prematurely before reaching a\npoint syntactic and prosodic completion (n = 14, or 24.1%).\nThe presence of a disﬂuency in the utterance of the overlapped\nspeaker before the start of the overlap (i.e., short silent pauses,\nrepeated syllables or words, or noticeable decreases in speech\nrate)was alsocommon. Inthese cases,it seemsthat the recipient\nproduced a backchannel in response to the disﬂuency at a point\nwhen the interlocutor had already resumed her turn, causing\noverlap.Intotal,casesexhibitingoneormoreofthesesixfeatures\naccounted for95%ofthedata.\nThe remaining 10 cases involved three terminal between-\noverlaps aﬀecting the last syllable of the previous turn, two cases\nexhibiting laughter by one of the speakers, two cases involving a\nturn-initial particle (i.e.,uhm andwell)produced inoverlapwith\nthe last syllable of the preceding turn, one case with a speaker\ntalking to someone else in the room, and one case of overlap due\naclearphonetic segmentation error in theannotation.\nOur analysis thus conﬁrms that overlaps, though reasonably\ncommon(30%oftransitions),areofshortduration(i.e.,lessthan\n5%ofthespeechsignal;between-overlapshaveamodalduration\n96 ms), occur largely in principled places (e.g., in between-\noverlaps,afterpossiblecompletio ns,insimultaneousturn-starts),\nand mostly involve backchannels (which do not constitute full\nturns). In light of these observations, we conclude that the vast\nmajority of instances of overlap in our dyadic conversations are\nconsistent with the turn-taking system proposed bySacks et al.\n(1974).\n6. Psycholinguistics\nPsycholinguistic processing puts tight constraints on any\npsychologically real model of turn-taking. Here we ﬁrst draw\nattention to the early sensitivity to turn-taking in child\ndevelopment. Then we consider three main psycholinguistic\naspects: predictive theories of language comprehension, studies\nof language production (from conceptual planning to speech\narticulation), and ideas about the relation between these two\nprocesses. Finally we turn to a small number of experimental\nstudies aimed at understanding the relationship between\ncomprehension andproduction processes inturn-taking.\n6.1. ‘Proto-Conversation’ and Turn Taking in\nHuman Development\nParallel toSacks et al.(1974), in the 1970s there was an interest\nin children’s acquisition of turn-taking abilities.

Subsequent work\nshowed that this gap reduced in the following pre-linguistic\nmonths to around 800 ms (Jasnow and Feldstein, 1986; Beebe\net al., 1988). Such early onset suggests that turn-taking may\nhave an instinctive basis.Garvey and Berninger(1981)s h o w e d\nthat the gap duration increased toward a second and a half\nin toddlers, presumably because of the cognitive diﬃculties of\nlanguage production, and remained at around a second even\nfor 5-year-olds [this slow convergence with adult norms has\nrecently been conﬁrmed for a larger sample by Stivers et al.\n(underreview)].\nAfter a long pause, there is now renewed interest in the\ndevelopment of turn-taking and its timing in children, and we\nnow have better data, methods and concepts. Using audiovisual\ncorpustechniques,Hilbrinketal.(submitted)haveconﬁrmedthe\ngeneralpatternearlierreported,namelyrelativelyfasttransitions\nin the prelinguistic period, with a slowing down as language\nstarts to be comprehended at 9 months. Using eye-tracking of\ninfants watching dyadic interaction, several studies have shown\nthat 3-year-olds observers of dyadic conversations between two\nadults cananticipate speaker transitions (Tice and Henetz, 2011;\nCasillasandFrank,2013 ,submitted; Keiteletal.,2013 ).Although\nthe gaze shifts tend to occur in the gap (i.e., not in overlap\nwith the turn preceding the ﬂoor transition), known saccade\nlatencies for infants are c. 300 ms (Fernald et al., 2008), showing\nthat they have often systematically detected the end of the turn\nbefore the gap. Researchers have also been able to show that by\n3 year-olds, children are using intonation to do this projection\nof turn-ends (Keitel et al., 2013). Casillas and Frank (submitted)\nfound that 3-year-olds were just as good at anticipating speaker\nchangeasadults,anddidsomoreafterquestionsthanstatements.\nThey then looked at younger infants and ﬁltered the speech,\nso they could distinguish whether prosody or lexico-syntax was\nenabling this anticipation. They found that 1 and 2 year-olds\nwere better than chance at anticipating transitions, and that\nanticipation improves with age. Children under 3 were better\nin the prosody-only condition (with words ﬁltered out) than\nthey were in the words-only condition (with prosody ﬁltered),\nindicating anearlyadvantageforprosody (adultsonlyshowedan\nadvantage for words+ prosody). Clearly these studies conﬁrm\nthat projection is a real phenomenon, that it is learnt early,\nand that prosody plays an important role in this ability. They\nalso indicate that turn-taking is established before language,\nthat it forms a framework for language acquisition, and that\nthe complexities of language slow down the framework through\nmiddlechildhood.\n6.2. Predictive Language Comprehension\nEarly in the history of psycholinguistics,Chomsky (1969,p .5 7 )\ninsisted that probability and prediction had no possible role to\nplayinascientiﬁctheoryoflanguage:“Itmustberecognizedthat\nthe notion ‘probability of a sentence’ is an entirely useless one,\nunderanyknowninterpretationofthisterm.”Hereasonedthata\ngrammar bounds adiscreteinﬁnity, andhence there wasno core\nrole for prediction in language understanding. The spell lasted\ndecades, but meanwhile both engineering and psycholinguistic\nexperimentshavedemonstratedacoreroleforstatisticallearning\nand estimation in language comprehension. For example, eye-\nmovement studies in the visual world paradigm show that\nlisteners predict upcoming entities from likely collocations (e.g.,\nhearing “the boy is eating” participants look at the cake and not\nthe ball in the picture). Determiners (e.g., Frenchun vs. une),\nAdjectives (“freshly baked”) and verbs (“eat”) can predict nouns\nbytheirselectionalrestrictions; inlanguagethathaveverbsatthe\nend of the sentence like Japanese, participants can use the nouns\nto predict the verbs (Altmann and Kamide, 1999; Kamide et al.,\n2003). Another source of insight comes from EEG, where it can\nbe shown that the syntactic frame is used to predict upcoming\nmaterial. For example, when the sentential context leads one to\nexpect a speciﬁc noun (‘she carried the eggs in a... ’) but the\ngender of an incoming article is incongruous an N400 may be\nevoked before the noun itself is encountered (e.g., in Spanish\nuna canasta ‘a basket’ vs.un costal ‘a sack’). These studies use\nthe inverse correlation between the cloze probability and the\namplitudeofanN400todemonstrateprediction(itishardinfact\nto distinguish prediction from integration diﬃculties; seeKutas\net al., 2011for review). Predictive language comprehension is\nnot only achieved on the basis of semantic and morphosyntactic\nregularities. In an experiment involving visual searches under\nthe directions of a confederate,Ito and Speer (2008)s h o w e d\nthat participants could anticipate referents on a screen (e.g., a\n“drum” vs. a “ball”) on the basis of the location of contrastive\npitch accents in the vocal instructions being given to them (e.g.,\n“now take the GREEN ball” vs. “now take the green BALL”).\nListeners therefore appear to be able to use diﬀerent sorts of\nlinguisticinformation(i.e.,semantic,morphosyntactic, prosodic)\nin order to predict the content of an incoming utterance. For an\noverview of recent work on predictive language understanding\nseePickering andGarrod(2013).\nRecent investigations have also shown direct connections\nof these predictive inferences to projection in conversation.\nGisladottir et al.(2015) conducted an EEG experiment in which\nparticipants listened to mini-dialogs of two turns. The second\nturn (e.g., “I have a credit card”) could be invariant over three\nconditions, a question like “How are you going to pay?,” an oﬀer\nlike “I can lend you the money,” or a trouble announcement like\n“I don’t have any money.” In each of three contexts, the same\nsecond turn performs a diﬀerent speech act (i.e., an answer, a\ndeclination, or an oﬀer). The EEG signal, averaged over many\nsuch adjacency pairs, showed that very early (often in the ﬁrst\n400 ms) the diﬀerent speech act forces of the response were\npredicted. Speech act detection is the precondition to response\npreparation, and it seems to be an early predictive process.\nA second relevantstudy(Magyari et al., 2014) looked at the EEG\nsignal of participants listening to turns extracted from genuine\nconversationswhoseturn-endingstheyhadtopredictbypressing\nabutton. Theseturns hadalreadybeensorted intounpredictable\nvs.predictable byaclozetest,whereparticipants hadtoguessthe\nmissing words of items cut-oﬀ at various points. The predictable\nturns (compared to the unpredictable ones) showed a very early\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nEEG signature of preparation to respond about half way through\nthe turn (c. 1200 ms before the end). RecentlyRiest et al.(2015)\nshow experimentally that responses based on prediction are\nnot signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than those based on pre-knowledge.\nThey also incidentally attempt to estimate stochastic tendencies\nfor possible reactive responses (although these stimuli are non-\nlinguistic and do not have the uncertainty associated, e.g., with\nvoiceless stops). These studies together suggest that quite long-\nrangeprediction isnormallyinvolvedinunderstanding language\nin aconversational mode.\n6.3. Latencies in Language Production\nThere are striking diﬀerences between language comprehension\nand production despite the fact that the processes must be\nintimately related.Oneof theclearestdiﬀerences isin processing\nspeed. Speech production is a bottleneck on the whole language\nsystem: at about an averageof sevensyllables per second, speech\ncan be estimated to have a bit-rate of under 100 bps (Levinson,\n2000, p. 28). Studies of language production show that pre-\narticulation processes run three or four times faster than actual\narticulation (Wheeldon and Levelt, 1995). Studies of language\ncomprehension under compression show that people can parse\nand comprehend speech at three or four times the speed of\nspeech production (Calvert, 1986, p. 178;Mehler et al., 1993).\nSpeech encoding is one part of the process that has to be strictly\nserial.Articulationisthusaseverebottleneckoncommunication,\nand the system compensates by utilizing pragmatic heuristics\nin production that augment the coded message ( Levinson,\n2000).\nHappily, there have been extensive studies of language\nproduction that allow us to quantify the latency in each part of\nthe production process, using picture naming as a task (Levelt,\n1989). The average reaction from seeing a picture to beginning\nthenamingofhasbeenestimatedat600ms( IndefreyandLevelt,\n2004, p. 106). The literature unfortunately gives no ranges or\nstandard deviations, with the exception of a study byBateset al.\n(2003), which provides cross-linguistic averages that are much\nlongeratover1000ms,withallminimumsover650ms. Indefrey\nandLevelt (2004,p.108),onthebasisofameta-studyofavailable\nexperiments, propose approximate ﬁgures for each stage of the\nprocess, which weshow inTable 3.\nFormultiword utterances,theeﬀect isnotlinear.

Most of these studies incidentally (but\nnot Bates et al., 2003) involve pre-familiarization of the words\nand pictures, so these response times are eﬀectively after some\namountof priming.\nThere is also good information on the planning required\nfor sentence production from eye-movement studies. When\nparticipantsareshownpicturesof simpletransitiveorintransitive\nscenes(e.g.,boykickingball,gi rlrunning),ittakesabout1500ms\nbefore speech output begins (Griﬃn and Bock, 2000; Gleitman\net al., 2007). Interestingly, what happens within this 1500 ms\nis language-dependent – for example verb-ﬁrst languages show\nrather diﬀerent visual scanning of the pictures than verb medial\nlanguages (Norcliﬀe et al., 2015 ), but the latencies remain\nsimilar.\nDuring this period of planning for language production,\noutput processes involve the synergies between multiple speech\norgans. For example, breathing for speaking may need to be\ninitiated. Earlier studies have shown that such breathing activity\ninvolves a number of latencies: ﬁrst, c. 140–320 ms must be\nallowed for from the time the decision to inhale is made till the\ntime the signal reaches the intercostal muscles (Draper et al.,\n1960); second, the inhalation time in spontaneous dialog is\ntypically over 500 ms long (McFarland, 2001, p. 136). Together,\nthese numbers suggest a latency of at least 500–800 ms prior to\nspeech. In a recent study of breathing in conversation (Torreira\net al., 2015, this volume), we have shown that short responses\nto questions are often made on residual lung air, whereas\nlonger responses are likely to require a planned inhalation.\nThe actual inhalation most typically starts brieﬂy (i.e., 15 ms)\nafter the end of the interlocutor’s question, and it is probably\ntriggered just before the phonological retrieval process for the\nﬁrst word of the planned response. Thus the breathing data\nsuggests that whether or not inhalation is required is a decision\nmade during conceptual planning of the response, and that the\ntrigger for inhalation, most typically produced during the last\nfew hundred ms of the interlocutor’s turn, is often based on\na prediction that the current speaker will imminently end her\nturn.\nRecent studies of vocal preparation using ultrasound\ntechniques show that tongue movements preceding speech\nproduction start considerably before the acoustic signal, with\nclear preparation between 120 and 180 ms prior to the acoustic\nrelease (Schaeﬄer et al., 2014) and with some eﬀects detectable\nas early as 480 ms ( Drake et al., 2014). Although not yet\nstudied in a conversational context (although seede Vos et al.,\n2015, this volume, for the parallel in signed conversation),\nthese measurements provide further estimates of the latencies\ninvolved in language production. These latencies are perhaps\nnot surprising given the complexity of language encoding and\nthe need for the processes to be funneled into a single, serial\nsequence of operations. Donders (1869) showed that reaction\ntime varies with the number of choices that need to be made,\nand Hick’s Law (Hick, 1952) suggests this relation is generally\nlogarithmic (reaction time will increase with decision time,\nwhere decision time T= log\n2(n) and n is the number of equally\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nprobable choices). When one considers that in production single\nwords haveto be plucked from a word lexicon consisting of over\n20,000 entries, one can see immediately the processing problems\ninvolved. Combined with the relatively slow nature of nerve\nconduction (known sinceHelmholtz, 1850), and the complexity\nof the coordination of c. 100 muscles involved in articulation\n(Levelt,1989), slowreaction timescan beexpected.\nTo summarize, language production involves latencies of\nwell over half a second, and a multi-word utterance is likely\nto involve a second or more of processing before articulation\nbegins. Although the conversational context may expedite some\nof these processes, the bulk of this latency is attributed to the\nphonological and phonetic encoding processes (as are frequency\neﬀects, Jescheniak and Levelt, 1994) which are probably not\ncompressible.\n6.4. Experimental Studies of Turn-T aking\nThere have been as yet relatively few experimental studies of\nturn-taking, due to the diﬃculties involved in gaining suﬃcient\nexperimental control in free interaction. However, indirect\nlight has been thrown on the mechanisms by extracting turns\nfrom conversation and experimentally testing when and how\nparticipants detect turn ends.De Ruiter et al.(2006)e x t r a c t e d\nturns from a corpus of conversations in Dutch, and got\nparticipants to press a button in anticipation of turn endings.\nThey manipulated the turns so that there were versions where\npitch information was ﬁltered out (No Pitch), where the words\nwere masked but the pitch preserved (No Words), where both\nwere ﬁltered (No Pitch, No Words) and ﬁnally where amplitude\nvariation was also removed (Noise condition). They found\nthat accuracy of turn-end anticipation was preserved under\nNo Pitch, but signiﬁcantly lost under No Words, and hugely\naﬀected under the other conditions, and they claim that “The\nconclusion is clear: lexicosyntactic structure is necessary (and\npossibly suﬃcient) for accurate end-of-turn projection, while\nintonational structure, perhaps surprisingly, is neither necessary\nnor suﬃcient” (DeRuiteretal.,2006 ,p. 531).\nThis study suggested then that lexicon and syntax are the key\nguide to turn-structure and completion. But there are aspects\nof prosody and articulation that may be critical, and in the\nnormal case intonation may also be an important signal. To\ntest this,Bögels and Torreira(in press) used turns taken from\nmultiple scripted interviews, with questions like “So you’re a\nstudent at Radboud University?” (long version) vs. “So you’re a\nstudent?” (short version). The short versions exhibited a higher\nmaximum pitch and greater duration on the last syllable of the\nword ‘student’ than the long versions, due to the presence of\nan intonational phrase boundary at the end of this word in the\nshort questions, butnot inthelongquestions. Theycross-spliced\ntheir materials in diﬀerent ways, and did the same button-press\nexperiment as De Ruiter et al.(2006). Participants often false\nalarmed (pressed the button) at ‘student’ when a phrase-ﬁnal\nword was cross-spliced into the middle of the long version –\nthey were clearly using the prosodic information to anticipate\nturn closure. Participants were also presented with truncated\nlong sentences ending in a syntactic point of completion, but\nlacking a ﬁnal intonation phrase boundary: now participants\nonly reacted on average around 400 ms after the end of the\nstimulus, suggesting that in this case participants’ button presses\nwere produced in reaction to silence. On the other hand, in\nanother condition consisting of similar words, but featuring a\nﬁnalintonational boundary,RTswerearound100msonaverage,\nsuggesting reaction to or local prediction of an intonationally\nwell-formed question end. It should be noted that while pitch\nh a db e e nﬁ l t e r e di nt h eDe Ruiter et al.(2006)s t u d y ,d u r a t i o n\nand other phonetic cues to prosodic structure were still present\nin their ﬁltered No Pitch condition. This new study shows that\nparticipants do use prosodic cues to judge turn-ending. What\nthe de Ruiter et al. study does establish is that they need to be\nintegrated with the lexical/syntactic information to carry turn-\nendingindications.\nThere are other experimental techniques that can be used\nto explore turn-taking. One is to use confederates (Bavelas and\nGerwing, 2011), another to use the visual world paradigm with\neye-tracking (Sjerps and Meyer, 2015). The latter study, using a\ndual task paradigm, found that maximal interference in the non-\nlinguistic task occurred 500 ms before the end of the incoming\nturn (see alsoBoiteau et al., 2014); however, the linguistic task\ninvolved visual monitoring and was non-contingent with the\nincoming turn, sowasfar removedfrom conversation.\nAmethodthatcombinescontrol withliveinteractioninvolves\nalternating live and pre-recorded responses in such a way that\nparticipantsareunawareofthemanipulation( Bögelsetal.,2014 ).\nIn a recent study, we exploited this technique in a quiz-game\n(Bögels et al., submitted). Participants were recorded for EEG in\nashieldedroom, andcouldnotseethequiz master–thisallowed\nsome of the interaction to be live, some pre-recorded.

The Core Psycholinguistic Puzzle\nFrom a psycholinguistic point of view, turn-taking presents\nthe following puzzle: in spite of the long latencies involved in\nlanguage production (600–1500 msor more), participants often\nmanagetoachievesmoothturntransitions(withthemosttypical\ngaps as little as 100–300). As a solution to this puzzle, we suggest\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nthat comprehension is predictive, even more so than is currently\nthought. As soon as possible, participants extract the speech act\noftheincomingutterance,whichisthe sine qua nonforplanning\ntheir appropriate response. In order to overcome the production\nlatencies, they must also start the planning and encoding of the\nresponse assoon aspossible.\nThis suggests that there is a signiﬁcant overlap of\ncomprehension and production processes. Given an average\nturn (approximated as an interpausal unit in our Switchboard\nCorpus data) of 1680 ms, somewhere in the middle response\npreparation may already be underway. This provides a second\ncentral puzzle: conversation involves constant double tasking,\nand this double tasking uses the same language system. The\ndiﬃculty of the puzzle is increased when one takes into account\nthe ﬁndings that both comprehension and production use much\nof the same neural circuitry (Segaert et al., 2011). It is plausible\nthat the diﬃculty here is overcome through rapid task switching,\nand the gradual switch of resources from comprehension of the\nincoming turn toward production of theresponse.\nPickering and Garrod (2013) outline a general model of\npsycholinguistic processing, suggesting that production and\ncomprehension are intimately intermeshed. Just as generally\nin action control, forward prediction of one’s own action is\nperformed to correct deviations, so in interaction forward\nprediction of the other’s actions is used to check perception,\nand aid preparation of response. This is a nice account, but\nthe complexities rapidly multiply. Listeners, on this account,\nare both using their full comprehension system, and running\na fast simulation of the other’s production in order to predict\nthe outcome. Now, given the turn-taking facts established\nabove, we must add to this computational burden the need\nto simultaneously prepare one’s own turn in advance involving\nboth the full production system and a hypothesized fast forward\npredictor. So the poor listener who is about to respond has not\nonly the full comprehension and production processes running\nsimultaneously, butalsotwofastprediction systems(oneforself,\none for other). This quadruple tasking looks unlikely, especially\nas similar tasks are hard to multitask. Additional problems are\nthatunlike physical actionprediction, whichcanbeestimatedby\na few heuristics, it is not clear how a fast approximate language\nprediction system would be feasible especially in production –\nproducers have to grind through the syntax to ﬁnd, e.g., what\norder to put words in. More likely the real production system\nmaybe involvedminus the phonological andphonetic encoding,\nwhich account for thebulk of theproduction latency.\nIn any case, regardless of how this is achieved, the\nexperimental and corpus studies reviewed in this section\nconverge in showing that participants in conversation often\nanticipate the content of the others’ turns well in advance, and\nthat theyusethatinformation toprepare their response early.\n7. Models of Turn-taking\nLet us now gather together how the observations and inferences\ndiscussed above constrain viable models of turn-taking.\nAny adequate model must be consistent with a number of\nobservations and constraints, as originally noted bySacks et al.\n(1974, p. 700). Weare now, however, able to addboth additional\nconstraints and a certain amount of temporal precision to those\nearlyobservations:\n(1) Turns are mostly short (mean 1680 ms, median 1227 ms; cf.\nsee Section 5.2.1), consisting of one or more interjections,\nphrases or clauses at the syntactic level, and one or\nmore intonational units at the prosodic level. Turn ends\ntypically co-occur with points of both syntactic andprosodic\ncompletion.\n(2) Intra-speakergapsarelongerbyc.150msthaninter-speaker\ngaps (ten Bosch et al., 2005), suggesting ordered rules (the\nrights to the next turn unit belong ﬁrst to the next speaker,\nandonly ifnot exercised,tothe current speaker).\n(3) Inter-speakergapsaremosttypicallyshort,withmodalvalues\nfor FTOs falling between 100 and 200 ms (cf.Figure 2).\nMediumgaps and short overlaps arealso common, although\nlesssothanshort gaps.\n(4) Lengthy gaps (over 700 ms) may carry semiotic signiﬁcance\n(mostly, of an undesired or unexpected response;Kendrick\nandTorreira, 2015),thus contributing topropel fasttiming.\n(5) Overlaps, though common, are brief (with amean of 275 ms\nat turn-transitions, and occupying less than 5% of the\nspokensignalinourtelephonecallsdata).Overlapsaremore\ncommon at turn transitions than within turns, and mostly\ninvolveback-channels,simultane ousﬁrst-starts, disﬂuencies,\nandotherfeaturespredicted by Sacksetal. (1974).\n(6) Turn-taking is established early in infancy, long before full\nlinguistic competence, whichactually appears to slow down\nresponse times; adultconversation timing is not achievedtill\nlateinmiddlechildhood.\n(7) Given the latencies of speech production (over 600 ms),\nincoming turns have to be predicted if accurate timing is to\nbe achieved. EEG recordings suggest the production process\nin responsive turns starts as soon as the gist of the incoming\nturncanbedetected.\n(8) Turn-ﬁnal cues seem to be used to recognize that a turn\nis deﬁnitely coming to an end. These cues are typically\nprosodic (e.g., phrase-ﬁnal syllable lengthening and speciﬁc\nmelodic patterns in many intonational languages) but also\nsyntactic(e.g.,syntacticclosure), andinprinciple couldbeof\nother types too (e.g., gestural). In the appropriate pragmatic\ncontext, these turn-ﬁnal cues can trigger the decision of\nthe next speaker to articulate. From the point of view of\nsocial interaction, it is eﬀective articulation that constitutes a\npoint of no return (as opposed to other preparatory events\npreceding speech, such as pre-utterance inhalations and\nmouth noises).\n7.1. The Standard Model and Alternatives\nWe have outlined above theSacks et al.(1974) model of turn-\ntaking as an opportunity-based or sharing system, regulated by\nnormative rules. The behavioral patterns on this account are the\noutcome of joint, coordinated determination of turns, against a\nbackground of an assumption of rights to minimal turns. Not all\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 12 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nturns are minimal of course, but in this case a bid must be made\nfor anextendedturn, asin:\n(9) Terasaki, 1976,p.53\nD: I forgot to tell you the two best things that happen’ to me\ntoday.\nR: Ohsuper=Whatwerethey?\nD: I got a B+ on my math test ((material omitted)) and I got\nanathleticaward.\nAn alternative model is the turn-end signaling system\nproposed byDuncan(1972), also mentionedabove,underwhich\nthe system is wholly in the control of the current speaker, who\nhas exclusive rights and signalstransfer at the end of the turn. In\ncontrast, Sacks et al.(1974) held that “It is misconceived to treat\nturns as units characterized by a division of labor in which the\nspeaker determinesunits and boundaries,” instead,“the turn as a\nunit isinteractively determined.”\nDuncan (1972, p. 286) proposed a simple rule of the sort\n“The auditor may take his speaking turn when the speaker gives\na turn-yielding signal.” Such a system would be in eﬀect like\nthe “over and out” cuing at the end of turns on a two-way\n(half duplex) radio which permits hearing or talking but not\nboth at once by a single party. Such a system predicts that\noverlap can only occur when “over” cues are mistakenly given\nor overridden; the large incidence of overlaps in corpora, and\ntheir clustering at principled locations (like overlapped tags or\naddress forms) is then hard to reconcile with such a model.\nAs mentioned, the model presumed that these turn-yielding\nsignals such as intonation are context-independent, but in fact\nwe know they are not – e.g., in English ﬁnal rising intonation in\na question may signal ﬁnality but in a statement continuation;\nthus their interpretation would haveto be embeddedincomplex\ncomprehension processes. The model is in any case very partial:\nittellsusnothingabouthoworwhypeopleshouldinitiateaturn,\nwhy turns are generally short, how multiple participants can be\nintegratedintoasingleconversation,howoverlapisresolved,and\nso forth. But it may add a component to a more complex overall\nmodel.\n7.2. Toward an Adequate Psycholinguistic\nModel of Turn Taking – Cognitive\nProcesses in the Responder\n1\nWe believe that the property list in Section 7 above puts fairly\nnarrow constraints on a possible model of turn-taking. One\narea of particular interest is the temporal constraints that turn-\ntakingimposesonlanguageprocessing,giventhatconversational\ninterchange is the core form of language use. These constraints\nare funneled into one crucial link in the system, namely, the\ncurrent addressee preparing to respond. Here we consider the\ncognitive processes thatmustbeinvolved.\nThe crucial questions concern what factors govern the\ndecisionmakingprocessthatliesbehindtheinitiationandtiming\n1The ideaspresentedinthis sectionweredevelopedincollaboration withMathias\nBarthel, SaraBögels,and the othermembersofthe INTERACT projectat the Max\nPlanck Institute for Psycholinguistics. See also Section 5.3 inHeldner and Edlund\n(2010)foraparallelproposal.\nof response. While turn-ﬁnal cues in the incoming turn seem\nlikely to play a role, they cannot be suﬃcient given the long\nlatencies in language planning and production. To overcome\ntheselonglatencies,predictivecomprehension mustbeinvolved,\ntogetherwithastrategyofearlybeginningstoproduction. Bögels\net al. (submitted) suggest that production begins as soon as it\ncan – that is, as soon as the speech act content of the incoming\nturn is clear. This implies of course dual-tasking, perhaps by\nrapid alternation (‘time sharing’). A new study using a dual-task\nparadigmandeye-trackingsuggeststhattheheaviestinterference\nis rather late (Sjerps and Meyer, 2015), and tied to looking-for-\nspeaking which waspostponed in this task toward the end of the\nincoming turn. Both early and lateprocesses are almostcertainly\ninvolved,butwhatexactlyishappening,andwhenduringnatural\nconversation remainstobedetermined.\nThe ﬂowchart diagram in Figure 3 sketches the cognitive\nprocesses that must minimally be at work in the recipient\nof a typical turn at talk during conversation. Predictive\ncomprehension is underway early, and already by half way\nthrough more predictable turns will suggest a temporal envelope\nfor completion (Magyari et al., 2014). If so, morphosyntax may\nprovide most of the early clues to the overall structural envelope\n(e.g., turns beginning withif or either or whenever projects a\ntwo clause structure), so oﬀering some long distance projection.\nWithin the last half second or so, the actual words will often be\npredicted (Magyari and de Ruiter, 2012), and, within that same\nlate time-frame, cues to imminent turn closure, usually prosodic\nandphonetic,arelikelytoappear( LocalandWalker,2012 ;Bögels\nandTorreira, inpress), indicating alikely turn end.\nA recipient’s ﬁrst task is to identify or predict the speech\nact or action being carried out – both the illocutionary force\nand the likely propositional content. In cases in which the\nillocutionary force of the incoming utterance makes a ﬂoor\nexchange relevant or due, production planning may begin as\nsoon as it is recognized, as suggested by the results in Bögels\net al. (submitted). Production is, at least in the latter stages,\nserial, and proceeds through conceptualization, lemma retrieval,\nphonological retrieval, and phonetic encoding, following a time\ncourse that seems well understood (Indefrey, 2011), extending\n600–1200 ms or more before articulation depending on the ease\nof retrieval and the length of the turn. In this model, early\npreparation is assumed, but actual articulation is held till turn-\nﬁnal cues (e.g., upcoming syntactic closure, a non-turn-keeping\nintonational phrase boundary) are detected, whereupon actual\narticulation is launched.Assumingthese cuesfall in the last half-\nsecond of the incoming turn, reaction to those will be suﬃcient\nto launch pre-prepared material so that it appears soon after the\nother ’ sturniscompleted.\nFigure 3 sketches the kind of interaction between\ncomprehension and production processes that must be\ninvolved in a typical turn transition (i.e., involving a FTO\nof c. 200 ms). There is an early gist comprehension with speech\nact apprehension sent as soon as possible to the production\nconceptualizer (see Levinson, 2013; Gisladottir et al., 2015).\nThe production system may automatically begin to formulate\nright down to the phonology (Bögels et al., submitted), but with\nthe actual articulation held in a buﬀer until the comprehension\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 13 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nFIGURE 3 | Sketch of the interleaving of comprehension and production in the recipient of an incoming turn.\nsystem signals an imminent completion of the incoming turn.\nPrior to that signal, it is likely that pre-articulation preparation\n(requiringc.200ms)ofthevocalapparatuswouldbeunderway–\nthis would include readying the vocal tract for the gestures to\nbe made (seeDrake et al., 2014; Schaeﬄer et al., 2014), and the\ndecision to inhale prior to delivery of longer responses (Torreira\netal.,2015 ,thisvolume).\nMeanwhile the comprehension system continues to check the\nincoming signal for possible closure at both the syntactic and\nprosodiclevel.Assoonasthereareconsistentsignalsoflinguistic\ncompletion, a go-signal is sent to production, and any buﬀered\narticulation released. It is likely that visual monitoring of gesture\ncan also be utilized for the go-signal (Duncan, 1974), but this\nawaitsexperimentalconﬁrmation.\nThis model is responsive to all the constraints listed in\nSection 7.Whatthis modelcrucially addsis:\n(a) an account of how responders can often respond with short\nlatenciesdespitethelong latenciesoftheproduction system;\n(b) why the corpus statistical results reliably show a modal\nresponse with positive oﬀsets of around 100–300 ms,\nreﬂecting the reaction time to the turn-ﬁnal prosodic cues\nin the incoming turn (i.e., reaction to the go-signal, as\nhypothesized byHeldnerandEdlund,2010 ).\nThe model sketch inFigure 3 is based on average, modal,\nand minimal temporal latencies reported in the literature. We\nwould like to propose that this model is generally valid in the\nmost frequent scenarios. If speakers launched their responses as\nearly asthey could without waiting for turn-ﬁnal cues,weshould\nexpect overlapping or no-gap–no-overlap transitions to be the\nmost common, ratherthan ashort gap.And,ifspeakers typically\nlaunchedlanguageplanningonlyafteridentifyingturn-ﬁnalcues,\nweshould expect themost frequent transition timestoinvolveat\nleasthalfasecond ormorerath erthanshortgapsof100–300ms.\nThe model therefore captures the most typical turn transition\nvaluesobservedinconversational corpora.\nWhat,however,accountsforthesigniﬁcantnumberofoverlap\nand long gap cases observable in any conversation? A reviewer\nsuggests that human factors such as lack of attention, pre-\nformulated agendas, and apparent involvement with actual\nminimal responsiveness may all be involved, and notes that\napparentgoodtimingmaybeachievedwithbuﬀers likeparticles.\nHowever, the evidence is that conversation is generally more\ndemandingthanthat–forexample95%ofquestionsgetanswers\n(Stivers, 2010), and particles like well and uhm in English\nare semiotically loaded and thus not empty buﬀers (Kendrick\nand Torreira, 2015), while Roberts et al. (2015)f a i l e dt oﬁ n d\nstatistical diﬀerences in the timing of turns with and without\nsuch particles. In addition, it is likely that speakers sometimes\nuse other turn-taking than the one sketched inFigure 3.F o r\nexample, under competition for the ﬂoor, or when responding\nto highly predictable utterances, speakers may decide to launch\narticulationwithoutwaitingtoid entifyturn-ﬁnalcues.Incasesof\nlongtransition latencies,speakersmaynothavebeenabletoplan\nthe initial stagesoftheir turn earlyenough tolaunch articulation\nwhen the interlocutor’s turn-ﬁnal cues become available. This\nmay indeed be due to a low attentional level on the part of the\nspeaker, or to the interlocutor’s turn being unclear in purpose\nuntil itsendor simply tothecomplexity oftheresponse required\n(Torreira etal.,2015,thisvolume).\n8. Conclusion\nThis overview of work on turn-taking behavior over the\nlast half century shows that turn-taking is a remarkable\nphenomenon, for it combines high temporal coordination\nbetween participants with the remarkable complexity and open-\nendedness of the language that ﬁlls the turns. The tension\nbetween these two properties is reﬂected in the development\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 14 June 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 731\nLevinson and Torreira Timing in turn-taking and psycholinguistics\nof turn-taking in childhood (Proto-Conversation’ and Turn\nTakinginHumanDevelopment),anditposesasubstantialpuzzle\nfor psycholinguistic models (i.e., dual-tasking comprehension\nand production processes), which until recently have completely\nignored this, themost central form oflanguageuse.\nAcknowledgment\nThis research was ﬁnanced by the ERC Advanced grant\n#269484 INTERACT and by the Max Planck Institute for\nPsycholinguistics.\nReferences\nAltmann, G., and Kamide, Y.
