It covered 24 mil-\nlion ha area worldwide with a total production of 38 million tons\nin 2010 (FAOSTA T, 2010). In the last decade (2000–2010), the\nglobal groundnut production increased marginally. The global\nannual increase in production was 0.4% which was due to both,\nan annual increase in yield by 0.1% and in area by 0.3% (Figure 1).\nThe projected demand of groundnut in Asia alone by 2020 is\nexpected to be 1.6 times more than the level of production in\n2000 (Birthal et al., 2010). If the projected demands have to be\nmet, the productivity and production of the crop has to increase\nat a much higher growth rate than the present one. Asia and Africa\naccount for 95% of global groundnut area where it is cultivated\nunder rainfed conditions with low inputs by resource poor farm-\ners. Groundnut is a cash crop providing income and livelihoods\nto the farmer. It also contributes to nutrition of farm families\nthrough consumption of energy- and protein-rich groundnut\nkernels and provides nutritious fodder (haulms) to livestock. Thus\ngroundnut cultivation contributes to the sustainability to mixed\ncrop-livestock production systems, the most predominant system\nof the semi-arid areas.\nGroundnut is valued as a rich source of energy contributed by\noil (48–50%) and protein (25–28%) in the kernels. They provide\n564 kcal of energy from 100 g of kernels (Jambunathan, 1991).\nIn addition, the groundnut kernels contain many health enhanc-\ning nutrients such as minerals, antioxidants, and vitamins and are\nrich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids. They contain antioxidants\nlike p-coumaric acid and resveratrol, Vitamin E, and many impor-\ntant B-complex groups of thiamin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B-6,\nfolates, and niacin. Groundnut is a dietary source of biologi-\ncally active polyphenols, ﬂavonoids, and isoﬂavones. As they are\nhighly nutritious, groundnut and products based on groundnut\ncan be promoted as nutritional foods to ﬁght energy, protein, and\nmicronutrient malnutrition among the poor. Groundnut-based\nwww.frontiersin.org February 2013| Volume 4| Article 23 | 1\n“fpls-04-00023” — 2013/2/21 — 17:49 — pag e2—# 2\nJanila et al. Groundnut: genetic and genomic tools\nFIGURE 1|Three-year moving center average for groundnut pod yield,\nproduction, and area harvested in world.\nPlumpy’nut1, a ready to use therapeutic food, has helped\nsave the lives of thousands of malnourished children in Niger\n(UNICEF, 2007).\nOver 60% of global groundnut production is crushed for\nextraction of oil for edible and industrial uses, while 40% is con-\nsumed in food uses and others (such as seed for sowing the next\nseason crop; Birthal et al., 2010). Groundnut oil is an excellent\ncooking medium because of its high smoking point (Singh and\nDiwakar, 1993). India, China, Myanmar, and Vietnam use ground-\nnut oil for cooking purpose extensively. The cake obtained after\nextraction of oil is used in animal feed industry, in preparing\nenriched easily digestible food for children and aged persons, and\nas soil amendment. In Europe and North and South America about\n75% of the production is used as food, while only 35% is used for\nthe same purpose in Asia (Birthal et al., 2010). Peanut butter is\nthe most popular groundnut product in the USA, Canada, and\nAustralia. Groundnut seed can be consumed raw (non-heated),\nboiled, and roasted and also used to make confections and its ﬂour\nto make baked products. The groundnut shells are used for making\nparticle boards or used as fuel or ﬁller in fertilizer and feed indus-\ntry. Groundnut haulms constitute nutritious fodder for livestock.\nThey contain protein (8–15%), lipids (1–3%), minerals (9–17%),\nand carbohydrate (38–45%) at levels higher than cereal fodder.\nThe digestibility of nutrients in groundnut haulm is around 53%\nand that of crude protein 88% when fed to cattle. Haulms release\nenergy up to 2337 cal kg\n−1 of dry matter. Being a legume crop,\ngroundnut helps in improving soil health and fertility by leaving\nbehind N\n2 and organic matter in the soil.\nTAXONOMY AND BIOLOGY\nThe cultivated groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), an annual herb\nbelonging to the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae), is classiﬁed into\ntwo subspecies, subsp. fastigiata W aldron and subsp. hypogaea\nKrap. et. Rig. The subsp. fastigiata contains four botanical\nvarieties, var. vulgaris, var. fastigiata, var. peruviana, and var.\naequatoriana. The subsp. hypogaea contains two varieties, var.\nhypogaea and var. hirsuta. Each of these botanical types has\n1 http://www.nutriset.fr/fr/nos-produits/produit-par-produit/plumpy-nut.html\ndifferent plant, pod, and seed characteristics ( Krapovickas and\nGregory, 1994). Groundnut is an allotetraploid (2n = 2x = 40)\nwith “ AA ” and “BB” genomes. All species, except the cultivated\nspecies (A. hypogaeaand A. monticola)i nS e c t i o nArachis, and cer-\ntain species in SectionRhizomatosae, are diploid (2n= 2x = 20).\nThe diploid progenitors,A. duranensisand A. ipaensis, contributed\n“ AA ” and “BB” genomes, respectively, to the cultivated groundnut\n(Kochert et al., 1996). The phylogenetic analyses based on intron\nsequences and microsatellite markers also provide evidence for this\nhypothesis (Moretzsohn et al., 2012). A single hybridization event\nbetween the diploid progenitors followed by chromosome dou-\nbling (Kochert et al., 1996) about 3500 years ago lead to origin of\ncultivated groundnut. Southern Bolivia and Northern Argentina\nare thought to be center of origin of this crop (Gregory et al., 1980;\nKochert et al., 1996). The center of diversity of the genus includes\nW estern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Northern Argentina (Gre-\ngory et al., 1980). A. duranensis occurs throughout the region,\nwhile A. ipaensis has only been found in Southern Bolivia. The\ngenetic diversity of the genus is classiﬁed into four gene pools\n(Singh and Simpson, 1994): primary gene pool consisting of A.\nhypogaea and A. monticola, secondary consisting of diploid species\nfrom Section Arachis that are cross-compatible withA. hypogaea,\ntertiary consisting of species of theSection Procumbentes that are\nweakly cross-compatible with A. hypogaea, and the fourth gene\npool consisting of the remaining wild Arachis species classiﬁed\ninto seven other sections.\nGroundnut is a self-pollinated crop with cleistogamous ﬂow-\ners, but natural hybridization can occur to small extent where bee\nactivity is high (Nigam et al., 1983). Flowering begins 17–35 days\nafter seedling emergence depending on the cultivar and environ-\nmental conditions. Flowers, simple or compound, are born in the\naxils of leaves and never at the same node as vegetative branch. One\nor more ﬂowers may be present at a node. The stigma becomes\nreceptive to pollen about 24-h before anthesis and remains so for\nabout 12 h after anthesis, and the dehiscence of anthers takes place\n2–3 h prior to opening of the ﬂower in the morning. Fertilization\noccurs about 6 h after pollination. Depending upon the prevail-\ning temperatures, the peg or gynophore carrying the ovary and\nfertilized ovule on its tip appears in 6–10 days and grows to enter\nthe soil (positively geotropic) where it develops into pods. The tip\norients itself horizontally away from tap root. Groundnut grows\nwell in well-distributed rainfall of at least 500 mm. The growth\nand development is largely inﬂuenced by temperature in ground-\nnut and the optimum air temperature is between 25 and 30\n◦C.\nThe nutritional requirement of groundnut is different as the pods\ndevelop in the soil. Calcium is an important nutrient required for\npod and kernel development. It is unique to groundnuts that the\npods directly absorb most of the calcium, and therefore calcium\nfertilizers are applied in the pod zone at the peak ﬂowering stage\nto ensure its availability to the pods.\nTARGET TRAITS FOR GROUNDNUT IMPROVEMENT\nThe aim of groundnut breeding programs across the world is to\ndevelop new varieties that meet the requirements of grower, pro-\ncessor, and consumer. Thus the targeted traits for improvement\nin groundnut depend on the level of productivity achieved and\nconsumers’ and industry requirements in a country. In the USA,\nFrontiers in Plant Science| Plant Genetics and Genomics February 2013| Volume 4| Article 23 | 2\n“fpls-04-00023” — 2013/2/21 — 17:49 — pag e3—# 3\nJanila et al. Groundnut: genetic and genomic tools\nwhere average productivity is high, the focus is more on improv-\ning food quality and ﬂavor traits and freedom from mycotoxins\nin the produce. In the developing countries, where yields are gen-\nerally low, the focus is more on removing yield barriers besides\nimproving yield per se.\nYIELD PARAMETERS AND ADAPTATION\nYield and yield contributing parameters are the most widely tar-\ngeted traits of groundnut improvement programs worldwide.\nSelection for yield per se has been the major basis for improv-\ning groundnut productivity in the world (Nigam et al., 1991), but\ngains from such selection have been low and slow due to large g×e\ninteractions observed for these traits. The pod yield is a function of\ncrop growth rate, duration of reproductive growth, and the frac-\ntion of crop growth rate partitioned toward pod yield. Therefore\nunderstanding physiology of yield is also essential to better target\nyield increase. The important yield contributing parameters are:\npod yield per plant, number of pods per plant, shelling outturn,\nand 100-seed weight. Recently, physiological traits associated with\nyield (harvest index, transpiration-use-efﬁciency, etc.) are also\nreceiving attention in breeding programs which have necessary\ninfrastructure and resources. Other traits not having direct bearing\non yield such as ease in shelling, ease in harvesting (peg strength),\nnumber of seeds per pod (for speciﬁc uses), reticulation, beak and\nconstriction of pod, kernel shape and color, and blanching ability\nare also important considerations to satisfy farmers’ , processors’ ,\nand market demands. For the development of dual purpose vari-\neties, haulm yield becomes an important consideration in addition\nto pod yield. In addition to quantity of haulm produced, its quality\ndetermined by nitrogen content and digestibility are also impor-\ntant to breed dual purpose varieties. Crop duration and fresh seed\ndormancy in Spanish varieties are important adaptation traits.\nThe maturity duration should match with the length of growing\nperiod (LGP; 90 to over 150 days) available at a given location and\nconditioned by the soil moisture availability and climatic condi-\ntions (mainly temperatures and sunshine hours). Early maturity\nis an important trait in groundnut as it enables escape from stress\nconditions such as drought and frost and to ﬁt in multiple crop-\nping systems. In situ germination, a consequence of lack of fresh\nseed dormancy leads to pod yield and quality loss in rainfed envi-\nronments, particularly when rains coincide with the crop maturity\nstage.\nSTRESS TOLERANCE/RESISTANCE\nThere is large gap between potential pod yield and the realized\npod yield in most of the situations (Johansen and Nageswara Rao,\n1996). Potential yield is deﬁned as the maximum yield obtainable\nby the best genotypes in a speciﬁed agro-climatic environment\nwhen the known biotic and abiotic constraints are overcome. The\nyield gap in the groundnut grown under water limiting condi-\ntions in rainfed areas is further aggravated by incidence of a host\nof diseases and insect pests. Therefore, tolerance/resistance traits\nthat offer protection against losses caused by biotic and abiotic\nstresses are important target traits. In addition to protection to\nyield, resistance/tolerance to stress factors enhances the quality\n(nutritional, visual appearance, sensory attributes, free from tox-\nins, and post-harvest keeping quality) of both, pods and haulms\nthat fetches better price in the market. However, studies have\nshown that high yield potential and high degree of resistance do\nnot generally go together (Nigam et al., 1991), while the breeding\nprograms target them together. Therefore, in most of the breeding\nprograms a balance is struck between the yield potential and level\nof resistance to avoid any possible yield penalty. As a consequence,\nseveral varieties with high yield potential and moderate levels of\nresistance were bred and released for cultivation world over (see\nSome Accomplishments of Conventional Approaches). Drought\nand high temperature are the most important abiotic stresses that\nare widespread in groundnut-growing areas. Depending on the\ntime of occurrence, drought can be characterized as early season,\nmid-season, and end-of-season drought. Mid- and end-of-season\ndroughts are critical as they affect the pod yield and quality. Fur-\nther, end-of-season drought predisposes pre-harvest Aspergillus\ninfection in the ﬁeld that affects quality of produce. Linked closely\nwith drought is high temperature stress. T wo key stages for heat\nstress in groundnut are: ﬂowering including microsporogenesis\n(3–6 days before ﬂowering), and fruit-set (Craufurd et al., 2002,\n2003). The CGIAR’s climate change for agriculture and food secu-\nrity (CCAFS) research has shown that high temperature stress\n(above 30\n◦C) will be widespread in East and Southern Africa,\nIndia, South East Asia, and Northern Latin America, which are\nimportant groundnut-growing areas. Thus, effort to breed vari-\neties that can thrive and yield under both, drought and heat stress\nneed to be intensiﬁed. With the increase in problem soils (saline\nand acid) across the cultivated lands of the world, breeding for\ntolerance to salinity and aluminum toxicity in acid soils are consid-\nered important target traits for groundnut improvement in some\ncountries such as China.\nGroundnut is attacked by several diseases caused by fungi. Late\nleaf spot (LLS) caused byPhaeoisariopsis personata(Berk. & Curt.)\nV an Arx, early leaf spot (ELS) caused byCercospora arachidicola\nHori and rust caused byPuccinia arachidis Spegazzini are among\nthe major foliar fungal diseases worldwide. Aﬂatoxins are potent\ncarcinogen produced byAspergillus spp. infection in seed forcing\nseveral countries to have strict regimes in place on permissible lev-\nels of aﬂatoxins in their imports.A. ﬂavus is predominant species\nin Asia and Africa, whileA. parasiticusis in the USA. Stem and pod\nrot, caused by Sclerotium rolfsii, is potential threat to groundnut\nproduction in many warm, humid areas, especially where irri-\ngated groundnut cultivation is expanding. Groundnut is also a\nhost to several virus diseases, but only a few of them are econom-\nically important – groundnut rosette disease (GRD) in Africa,\npeanut bud necrosis disease (PBND) in India, tomato spotted\nwilt virus (TSWV) in the USA, peanut stripe potyvirus (PStV) in\nEast and South East Asia, peanut stem necrosis disease (PSND)\nin pockets in Southern India, and peanut clump virus disease\n(PCVD) in W est Africa (Nigam et al., 2012). Bacterial wilt, caused\nby Ralstonia solanacearum, is predominant among bacterial dis-\neases of groundnut. Globally, nematodes cause 11.8% yield loss in\ngroundnut. The root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp. and the\nlesion nematodes, Pratylenchus spp. are important in groundnut\n(Sharma and McDonald, 1990). Aphids (Aphis craccivora Koch),\nseveral species of thrips (Frankliniella schultzei, Thrips palmi, and\nF. fusca), leaf miner (Aproaerema modicella), red hairy caterpillar\n(Amsacta albistriga), jassids (Empoasca kerri and E. fabae), and\nwww.frontiersin.org February 2013| Volume 4| Article 23 | 3\n“fpls-04-00023” — 2013/2/21 — 17:49 — pag e4—# 4\nJanila et al. Groundnut: genetic and genomic tools\nSpodoptera are the major insect pests in groundnut, among which\naphids, thrips, and Spodoptera have worldwide distribution and\ncause serious damage (Wightman and Amin, 1988). In addition\nto causing yield losses, aphids and thrips are vectors of impor-\ntant virus diseases. T ermites, white grubs, and storage pests also\ncause damage to groundnuts. Groundnut borer or weevil (Carye-\ndon serratus) and rust-red ﬂour beetle (Tribolium castaneum)a r e\nthe major storage insect pests in groundnut. In most breeding\nprograms across the world, breeding for resistance to diseases has\nreceived more attention than breeding for resistance to insect pest\nexcept when they are vector of viral disease. Another important\nreason for this is the availability of the resistant sources for diseases\nin cultivated and wildArachis species.\nQUALITY PARAMETERS AND OTHER TRAITS\nQuality includes both, physical and chemical attributes. Nutri-\ntional traits include oil, protein, sugar, iron and zinc content, fatty\nacid proﬁle, and freedom from toxins, while the other quality\nparameters include visual and sensory attributes (consumer and\ntrader preferred traits) and traits desirable in food/oil processing\nindustries. Breeding for quality parameters in addition to yield\nenhances the economic returns to the farmers and other stake-\nholders along the value chain. Studies have shown that high oil\ncontent in groundnut is translated into economic beneﬁts to both\nfarmer and millers. Similarly, the produce with desirable traits for\nconfectionary uses fetches higher price in the market because of\nits export value. T raits impacting on food and oil uses are also\nimportant; they include both quality and nutritional parame-\nters. Depending on the nature of use, low oil and high protein\ncontents (for food use), high oil content (for oil use), and high\noleic/linoleic fatty acid ratio (for longer shelf-life) are impor-\ntant targeted traits in advanced breeding programs. The traits\nfor confectionary uses in India are: greater proportion of sound\nmature kernels (SMK), ﬂavor, 100 seed weight exceeding 55 g,\n>11% of sugar content, >24% of protein content, blanchability\n(>60%), and low oil content (<45%; Ramanathan, 2004). Seed\nmass is an important attribute to confectionary quality; however\nlike yield and yield parameters, it is highly inﬂuenced by envi-\nronment. The taste and sensory attributes of roasted groundnuts\nare associated with carbohydrate components of the kernel (Pat-\ntee et al., 2000). Seed color and shape and ﬂavor are the other\nimportant confectionary attributes. Blanchability is removal of\ntesta or seed coat (skin) from raw or roasted groundnuts and\nthis attribute is of economic importance in processed groundnut\nfood products, which include peanut butter, salted groundnuts,\ncandies, and bakery products and groundnut ﬂour. Groundnuts\nare rich source of several micronutrients, among which iron\nand zinc contents are important. Enhanced levels of iron and\nzinc are gaining importance with identiﬁcation of biofortiﬁca-\ntion (delivery of micronutrients via micronutrient-dense crops)\nas a cost-effective and sustainable approach to ﬁght malnutri-\ntion among poor. Development of groundnut cultivars suitable\nto mechanization is important in developed countries and it is\nalso becoming important in developing countries where human\nlabor for agricultural operation is not available or expensive. Some\nof the traits for such cultivars include strong pegs, uniform matu-\nrity of pods, break resistant pods, non-protruding radicle, and less\nerect plants with pods near the tap root. Biological nitrogen ﬁx-\nation (BNF) is another important target trait in groundnut that\ncan be improved through both, cultivar selection andRhizobium\nstrain improvement.\nGROUNDNUT IMPROVEMENT USING CONVENTIONAL\nAPPROACHES\nGENETIC VARIABILITY AND GENETICS\nThe genetic variability in groundnut is low due to origin of the\ncrop through a single hybridization event between two diploid\nspecies followed by a chromosome doubling and crossing bar-\nriers with wild diploid species (due of ploidy differences). The\ncultivated groundnut is an allotetraploid, while all wild Arachis\nspecies are diploid except A. monticola and certain species in\nSection Rhizomatosae. The low genetic variability for the traits of\nimportance and polyploidy nature are a bottleneck to the ground-\nnut improvement. The cultivated accession of Arachis hypogaea\nin the genebanks (repositories of plant genetic resources) and the\nadvanced breeding lines in the breeding programs are the most\nfrequently used sources of variability used as parents in hybridiza-\ntion. Groundnut genetic resources are available in the genebanks of\nICRISA T , National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR),\nand Directorate of Groundnut Research (DGR) in India; Oil\nCrops Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sci-\nences and Crops Research Institute of Guangdong Academy of\nAgricultural Sciences in China; U. S. Department of Agriculture,\nT exas A&M University, and North Carolina State University in the\nUSA; EMBRAPA - CENARGEN and the Instituto Agronômico\nde Campinas in Brazil; and Instituto Nacional de T ecnología\nAgropecuaria (INTA) and Instituto de Botánica del Nordeste\n(IBONE) in Argentina. Selection of an appropriate source that\ncan be used as a parent in hybridization is challenging for two\nreasons; ﬁrst adequate variability should be available to identify a\nsource and second, the amenability of trait for improvement that\nis determined by the genetic nature of the trait. Much of the vari-\nability till remains poorly used in improvement programs.Nigam\n(2000) reported that only three disease resistant parents (J 11, NC\nAc 17090, and PI 259747) appear in the parentage of the cultivars\nreleased in India. Ensuring genetic diversity in farmer’s ﬁelds is\nanother important challenge to the breeder when limited number\nof sources is known.\nGenetic variability for yield and yield attributes, resis-\ntance/tolerance to foliar fungal diseases (Singh et al., 2003), insect\npests (Lynch, 1990), root-knot nematode (Simpson et al., 1993),\ntraits for confectionary uses (Dwivedi and Nigam, 2005), oil con-\ntent and quality (Upadhyaya et al., 2011), haulm yield and quality\ntraits (Nigam and Blummel, 2010), and several other traits of eco-\nnomic importance were reported in literature (seeTa b l e 1). The\ngermplasm accessions of cultivated groundnut in the gene banks\nare a vast repository of this variation. Wild Arachis species are\nalso reported to possess desirable alleles for several economically\nimportant traits such as resistance to fungal and virus diseases,\ninsect pests, and abiotic stress ( Dwivedi et al., 2003, 2008; Rao\net al., 2003; Kalyani et al., 2007; Nautiyal et al., 2008) and therefore\ncan be potential sources for use in improvement of groundnut\n(Rao et al., 2003). However, a large proportion of cultivated and\nwild genetic resources of groundnut are yet to be studied and\nFrontiers in Plant Science| Plant Genetics and Genomics February 2013| Volume 4| Article 23 | 4\n“fpls-04-00023” — 2013/2/21 — 17:49 — pag e5—# 5\nJanila et al.

Core (representing 10% of\ntotal collection) and mini-core (representing 10% of core collec-\ntion) collections were made for the groundnut genetic resources\navailable in USDA/ARS ( Holbrook et al., 1993; Holbrook and\nDong, 2005), ICRISA T (Upadhyaya et al., 2002, 2003), and China\n(Jiang et al., 2008, 2010). Holbrook and Isleib (2001) observed\nthat the resistance genes were cluster geographically and acces-\nsions with multiple disease resistance were most common in India,\nMozambique, and Senegal.\nUnderstanding the nature of variability of the trait is important\nto select the breeding scheme to be employed for the improvement\nof the target trait. Reddy (1988) compiled the results of most of\nthe reported genetic studies in groundnut up until 1986 in a book\nchapter. The results of genetic/inheritance studies on various traits\nin groundnut continue to appear in literature. Both, qualitative\nand quantitative inheritance is reported for the traits of impor-\ntance. The qualitative traits, as expected, are governed by a few\ngenes [rust (Paramasivam et al., 1990), root-knot nematode (Choi\net al., 1999), rosette virus (Nigam and Bock, 1990), branching pat-\ntern (Pattanashetti et al., 2008), and high O/L ratio (Moore and\nKnauft, 1989)]. Both quantitative and qualitative inheritance is\nalso reported for several traits by different workers [(resistance to\nLLS; Motagi et al., 2000; Dwivedi et al., 2002), fresh seed dormancy\n(Khalfaoui, 1991; Upadhyaya and Nigam, 1999 )]. Most often,\nthere is preponderance of additive genetic variance for quanti-\ntative traits [drought tolerance traits (Upadhyaya, 2005), and seed\nsize (V enuprasad et al., 2011)]. Presence of dominance variance\nand epistasis variance due to allotetraploid nature of the crop are\nalso reported for most of the quantitative traits, but these cannot\nbe exploited in a self-pollinated crop such as groundnut. Inher-\nitance of some of the traits of economic importance is not yet\nfully understood. In many other cases, not much is known about\nwww.frontiersin.org February 2013| Volume 4| Article 23 | 5\n“fpls-04-00023” — 2013/2/21 — 17:49 — pag e6—# 6\nJanila et al. Groundnut: genetic and genomic tools\ntheir inheritance pattern because of lack of effective phenotyping\ntools.\nStudies on character association have resulted in identiﬁcation\nof associated traits that result in maximizing gains through selec-\ntion of both, target and its associated traits. In literature, several\nstudies have demonstrated the utility of correlation analysis in\ngroundnut based on plant and reproductive traits ( Gomes and\nLopes, 2005). Pod yield was reported to be positively associated\nwith number and mass of mature pods per plant, number and\nmass of mature kernels per plant, shelling outturn, 100-seed mass,\nprimary and secondary branches per plant, and harvest index.\nThus, selection is exercised for these associated traits simultane-\nously with target trait. Sometimes character association studies\nhave enabled the use of a robust, low-cost, and convenient surro-\ngate trait as an alternative to a laborious trait for phenotyping and\nmaking selections. For instance, SPAD chlorophyll meter reading\n(SCMR) and speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) are highly correlated with\nwater-use efﬁciency (WUE; Sheshashayee et al., 2006) and hence\nSPAD and SLA are used as the surrogate traits of WUE. At ICRISA T\nand several other groundnut breeding programs for drought tol-\nerance, the trait-based approach wherein selections are based on\nsurrogate traits of WUE, such as SPAD and SLA is adopted in\ncombination with empirical approach to maximize the genetic\ngains.\nThe g × e has considerable inﬂuence on the progress of crop\nimprovement and hence an important aspect for consideration. In\ngroundnut, a majority of target traits of economic importance are\npolygenic and are highly inﬂuenced by environment that hinders\nthe achievable genetic gains in breeding programs. Genetic anal-\nysis of yield revealed high inﬂuence of environment on pod yield\n(Zhang et al., 2011). High yielding cultivars with the least g × e\ninteractions are normally desirable. However, when a cultivar is\nto be selected for a speciﬁc environment, the g× e interaction is\ndesirable for maximizing production.\nBREEDING METHODS\nThe breeding methods used for self-pollinated crops are applied in\ngroundnut breeding. They include mass selection, pedigree, bulk,\nsingle seed descent, and back-cross methods. Introduction and\nmass selections played an important role in the beginning, but\nlater, hybridization followed by selection in segregating genera-\ntions following different methods was predominantly practiced in\nbreeding improved groundnut varieties. Emasculation and pol-\nlination procedures of hybridization are cumbersome and the\nsuccess rate of making crosses is generally low, particularly when\ncarried out by inexperienced hands. Another major challenge in\ngroundnut breeding like in many other crops is the time (8 years\nor more) lag between hybridizing two parents and identiﬁcation\nof an improved breeding line for release as variety.\nSegregating populations derived from crossing two parents\nare most common in groundnut breeding. Nevertheless, mul-\ntiple crossing systems, such as the double or convergent cross,\nto create adequate genotypic variability before selection (Wynne\nand Gregory, 1981) were also used. In groundnut, pedigree and\nbulk-pedigree methods of breeding are most frequently used to\nhandle segregating populations derived from hybridization. Pedi-\ngree method allows breeders to practice selection of traits with\nhigh heritability, such as plant type, pod and seed size, and shape\nand testa color in early generations. Selection of quantitative traits\nsuch as yield and seed composition are made in later generations.\nBulk-pedigree method is a modiﬁed method of bulk aimed at\nimproving traits with low heritability traits (Wynne and Gregory,\n1981). Single seed decent method is becoming popular as this has\nthe advantage to save space and resources (Isleib et al., 1994). Back\ncross breeding is used only sparingly; however with the advent of\nmolecular markers linked to the traits of interest and quantita-\ntive trait locus (QTL) identiﬁcation and mapping, back-crossing\nis used frequently in breeding programs. This will be discussed in\nmore details in molecular breeding (see Groundnut Improvement\nUsing Genomic T ools). Population improvement procedures are\nnot commonly used in groundnut because of difﬁculty in making\nlarge number of crosses required for population improvement.\nThe genetic variability available inA. hypogaeagenetic resources is\nbeing exploited through the above breeding procedures to develop\nimproved groundnut cultivars. But utilization of variability from\nwild Arachis species has been limited due to reproductive iso-\nlation of the cultivated species, A. hypogaea, an allotetraploid,\nfrom its diploid wild species due to ploidy differences and sterility.\nWide hybridization has been used to harness the potential alleles\nfrom wild species and this yielding fruits with regards to resis-\ntance to disease. Despite attempts the vast potential variability of\nwild Arachis species still remains locked. Mutation breeding, using\nboth physical and chemical mutagens has also been extensively\nused in groundnut breeding to induce variability that has resulted\nin development of several improved varieties. By 1996 in China,\n15% of new groundnut varieties were bred from induced mutants\nand they accounted for 19.5% of the cumulative cultivated area in\nthe country (Qui et al., 1998).\nField designs play an important role from early stages of breed-\ning that involve testing of a large number of genotypes for selection\nof few elite genotypes at later stages. Thus selection of an appro-\npriate ﬁeld designs is critical for efﬁcient and optimal utilization\nof resources, while ensuring identiﬁcation of best possible genetic\ncombinations in breeding programs. Multi-environment testing is\nadopted for development of superior genotypes adapted to a wide\nrange of environmental conditions. Participatory plant breeding\nhas gained signiﬁcance as it allows selection of genotypes for spe-\nciﬁc adaptation rather than for broad spatial adaptation (Ceccarelli\net al., 2007; Vindhiyavarman et al., 2010) and it is particularly\nimportant in developing countries as it also paves way to adop-\ntion of new improved varieties. In countries like India, Vietnam,\nIndonesia, and African countries, lack of adoption of new varieties\nhas been a major bottleneck to improved groundnut yields.\nPHENOTYPING TOOLS\nReliable and repeatable phenotyping remains the key to the success\nof any crop improvement program whether following conven-\ntional or molecular breeding approach. Several critical decisions\nin the process of breeding rely on results obtained from phe-\nnotyping. Phenotyping is important, ﬁrst to identify a suitable\nsource/donor for the trait, and second for selection and advanc-\ning the plants/progenies through the generations in the breeding\ncycles. Selecting a plant/progeny with desired combination of\ntraits and rejecting the undesirable remains a challenging task in\nFrontiers in Plant Science| Plant Genetics and Genomics February 2013| Volume 4| Article 23 | 6\n“fpls-04-00023” — 2013/2/21 — 17:49 — pag e7—# 7\nJanila et al. Groundnut: genetic and genomic tools\nbreeding programs as selections have to be exercised on a large\nnumber of plants/progenies with due consideration to a large\nnumber of traits simultaneously. Often, targeting multiple traits\nin breeding programs is limited by the challenges posed by simul-\ntaneous phenotyping for multiple traits. While in some cases it\nmay not be feasible in others, though feasible, imposed screen\nfor one trait may have confounding effect(s) on the other. For\ninstance, our experience in foliar fungal disease screening nursery\nhas shown that the rust pathogen, being obligate in nature, fails\nto establish and survive on leaf tissues that are already dead fol-\nlowing leaf spot pathogen infection. As a consequence the plants\ninfected with LLS pathogen will record low levels of rust infection\nand may get selected although the reason of low infection is other\nthan resistance in this case. Another major pitfall in phenotyping\nis the proportion of chance escapes that get selected and hence\nthe reliability and reproducibility are critical for a phenotyping\nprocedure.\nPhenotyping for qualitative traits, inherited by few major\ngenes is relatively easy. Phenotyping tools are extensively used by\nbreeders in collaboration with plant pathologists, physiologists,\nentomologists, biochemists, and food technologists for selec-\ntion and advancement of breeding populations and evaluation\nof advanced breeding lines. The technique that is reproducible,\nrobust, cost-effective, and non-destructive (for kernel oil content,\netc.) is desirable for phenotyping as breeding programs in general\nhave large number of segregating generations and advanced breed-\ning lines to screen. Phenotyping for reaction to diseases includes\nscreening under artiﬁcial inoculation in the laboratory, green\nhouse, and in ﬁeld and under natural disease pressure at hot spot\nlocations (Mayee and Munde, 1979; Foster et al., 1980; Nigam and\nBock, 1990; Pande et al., 1994; Subrahmanyam et al., 1995; Shokes\net al., 1998; Gorbet et al., 2004; Nigam et al., 2012). Either empir-\nical approach that involves measuring the yield under imposed\ndrought stress or salinity conditions or trait-based approach using\nsurrogates or a combination of both are used for phenotyping abi-\notic stresses. Understanding of physiological mechanisms involved\nin abiotic stress tolerance enable use of associated physiological\ntraits in breeding programs to enhance the efﬁciency of selection\nof desirable genotypes. Phenotyping tools for some traits such\nas A. ﬂavus contamination in the ﬁeld and reaction to soil-borne\ndiseases need to be further developed to improve their repeatabil-\nity. Similar is the case for phenotyping tools for reaction to insect\npests. If surrogates for complex traits are found, they could be\nexploited for phenotyping of complex traits. Currently available\nphenotyping techniques for important target traits of groundnut\nbreeding have been described byJanila and Nigam (2012)and are\nsummarized in Ta b l e 2.\nSOME ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES\nFollowing the breeding procedures and using various techniques\nof phenotyping, several improved groundnut varieties were devel-\noped and released for cultivation world over. Since 1986, national\npartners in 36 countries have released 136 improved ICRISA T-\nbred varieties in their respective counties. Some of the varieties\nare released in more than one country. The national programs in\nIndia have released 189 improved groundnut varieties for cultiva-\ntion in the country. The genetic gain for yield in India came from\nimprovement in seed size, seed weight, and number of pods per\nplant (Ratnakumar et al., 2012). From their study,Reddy and Basu\n(1989) reported that improved varieties alone contributed to 30%\nyield increase in India since 1967. Details of some these varieties\nreleased in different countries follow.\nJL 24, a popular short-duration groundnut cultivar in India, is\na selection made from genotype EC 94943 introduced from T ai-\nwan at the Oilseeds Research Station, Jalgaon, Maharashtra. It was\nreleased as JL 24 (Phule Pragati) in 1979 for cultivation in India\n(Patil et al., 1980). Subsequently, it was introduced to Africa and\nwas released and commercially cultivated in several other coun-\ntries (Chiyembekeza et al., 2001). It was also released in 1984/85\nas Sinpadetha 2 in Myanmar and in 1992 as UPL Pn 10 in the\nPhilippines. CG 7 (derived from USA 20× TMV 10 cross), also\nknown as ICGMS 42 or ICGV-SM 83708, is a high yielding Virginia\nbunch variety released in 1990. Recommended for cultivation in\nall groundnut-growing areas of Malawi, it is suitable for confec-\ntionery use and oil extraction. It is more tolerant to drought and\nmuch easier to harvest than Chalimbana, the most widely grown\nv a r i e t yi nM a l a w i(Subrahmanyam et al., 2000). Subsequently, it\nwas also released in T anzania as Mnanje in 2009, in Uganda as\nS e r e n u t1Ri n1999 and in Zambia as MGV 4 in 1990.\nFollowing extensive screening of 5000 breeding lines and\ngermplasm in wilt-sick plots in China and Indonesia, many geno-\ntypes with varying levels of resistance have been identiﬁed and\nusing them bacterial wilt resistant cultivars were released in China,\nIndonesia, and other South East Asian countries that have offered\nprotection against losses caused by the disease (Mehan et al., 1994;\nW ang et al., 2009). At ICRISA T , breeding for foliar fungal disease\nhas resulted in development of several genotypes with signiﬁcant\nlevels of resistance to rust and LLS ( Singh et al., 2003), which\nare either released for cultivation in several countries of Asia and\nAfrica or have been used as parents in national breeding pro-\ngrams. However, the ﬁrst few foliar diseases resistant releases such\nas Girnar 1 (derived from X 14-4-B-19-B× NC Ac 17090) in 1989\nand ICG(FDRS) 10 (derived from X 14-4-B-19-B × PI 259747)\nin 1990 in India, in spite of their higher yields under disease\nepidemic conditions, did not ﬁnd acceptance among the farm-\ners due to their poor pod and kernel characteristics as a result of\nlinkage drag.\nResistance to GRD was discovered in the late 1950s in local\nland races of Burkina Faso. Utilizing them, cultivars resistant to\nGRD, such as KH 149A, KH 241D, 69-101, RMP 12, RMP 91, and\nRG 1 were bred and released in the past in Africa. These culti-\nvars are now used as sources of resistance as the land races were\nsemi-erect and late maturing and several GRD resistant groundnut\nvarieties have been released (Mayeux et al., 2003; Ndjeunga et al.,\n2003; W aliyar et al., 2007). Wide hybridization has been used to\nexpand the gene pool by tapping alleles from wild species and sev-\neral interspeciﬁc derivatives have been developed for use as donors\nof desirable traits or release as cultivars. One classical example of\nthis is the release of two root-knot nematode-resistant groundnut\ncultivars (COAN) by the T exas Agricultural Experiment Station\nin 1999 after successful transfer of high level of nematode resis-\ntance into A. hypogaea from wild diploid species, A. cardenasii\n(Simpson and Starr, 2001 ).

The\nscreening methods for nematodes were useful to identify resistant\nsource and subsequently use the source to breed genotypes with\nresistance to root-knot nematodes (Simpson et al., 2003) and Kala-\nhasti malady (Tirupati 3; Mehan et al., 1993). GPBD 4, Spanish\nbunch groundnut genotype resistant to rust and LLS was released\nfor cultivation in India (Gowda et al., 2002). ICGV 86855, one of\nthe parents of GPBD 4, is an interspeciﬁc derivative betweenA.\nhypogaea × A. cardenasii resistant to rust and LLS.\nDrought resistant genotypes of groundnut were developed\nby selecting high pod yield under imposed soil moisture stress,\nreferred to as empirical approach (Branch and K vien, 1992). Sev-\neral drought tolerant varieties (55-437, GC 8-35, 55-21, 55-33,\nSRV 1-3, and SRV 1-96 among others) were developed in W est\nAfrica (Mayeux et al., 2003). Drought tolerant groundnut variety\nICGV 91114, released in India for cultivation in drought-prone\ndistrict Anantapur, which has world’s largest groundnut-growing\narea of about 800,000 ha in a district, has resulted in increase\nin net income by 36 and 30% reduction in year-to-year yield\nFrontiers in Plant Science| Plant Genetics and Genomics February 2013| Volume 4| Article 23 | 8\n“fpls-04-00023” — 2013/2/21 — 17:49 — pag e9—# 9\nJanila et al. Groundnut: genetic and genomic tools\nvariability for farmers in the district (Birthal et al., 2011). In China,\nseveral new groundnut cultivars with improved productivity and\nsome level of tolerance to aﬂatoxin contamination are extensively\nused in production in combination with integrated management\napproaches for aﬂatoxin management (Boshou et al., 2009). T o\nincrease breeding efﬁciency, studies on mechanisms of resistance\nto pre-harvest aﬂatoxin contamination were conducted and the\nmost promising mechanisms identiﬁed were resistance to drought\nand resistance to the groundnut root-knot nematode (Holbrook\net al., 2009). These approaches seem to be viable options for use\nin breeding in the absence of sources of resistance to aﬂatoxin\ncontamination.\nV arieties suitable for food uses were also released that include\nvarieties for confectionary uses that have high seed mass, desir-\nable seed shape, and ﬂavor. The return of investment (ROI)\nwas 133% for cultivation of large-seeded confectionary vari-\neties, Asha (ICGV 86564) and Namnama (ICGV 90320) in the\nPhilippines (PCARRD, 2009). Asha and Namnama were bred at\nICRISA T . In 2002, they were introduced to Philippines and sub-\nsequently released in 2005 for Region 2 of Philippines through\nBureau of Agricultural Research (BARI) and Philippines Coun-\ncil of Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research\nand Development (PCAARD). Another ICRISA T-bred variety,\nICGV 00440 was released as Mallika in India. Induced muta-\ngenesis along with recombination breeding at Bhabha Atomic\nResearch Centre (BARC), T rombay, India succeeded in develop-\ning several large-seeded genotypes, of which TG 1, TKG 19A,\nSomnath (TGS 1), TPG 41, TLG 45, and TG 39 were released\nfor cultivation to the Indian farmers ( Badigannavar and Mon-\ndal, 2007). Groundnuts are bred for high oleic to linoleic ratio\n(O/L ratio) to improve the oil quality.Gorbet and Knauft (1997)\nregistered the ﬁrst high oleic line, SunOleic 95R, and it was\nfollowed by another variety, Hull with high O/L ratio and resis-\ntance to TSWV (Gorbet, 2007). In breeding programs targeting\nimprovement of biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF), high per-\nforming genotypes were identiﬁed at ICRISA T (ICRISA T, 1981)\nand North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA (Wynne et al.,\n1980, 1983).\nGROUNDNUT IMPROVEMENT USING GENOMIC TOOLS\nThe conventional breeding approaches have been successful in\ndevelopment and release of several improved cultivars not just\nfor increased yield but also for resistance/tolerance to biotic and\nabiotic stresses thus offering protection against losses and for\nconsumer/trader preferred traits. The approaches were discussed\nhighlighting some successes in Section “Groundnut Improvement\nUsing Conventional Approaches.” However, the progress has been\nlimited in improvement of some of the traits. It is possible to\nspeciﬁcally target such traits for improvement, and also enhance\nthe efﬁciency of overall breeding program through use of molecu-\nlar breeding approaches. The following are the possible advantages\nof integration of molecular breeding approaches: (1) It pro-\nvides tools to target traits of economic importance that remained\npoorly/not amenable to conventional breeding approaches in part\ndue to their quantitative nature of inheritance and presence of\nhigh g × e. The identiﬁcation of genomic regions, popularly\ncalled QTLs for quantitative traits is now routine, and thus it is\npossible to achieve genetic gains through selection for quantita-\ntive traits via selection of the genomic region harboring major\nQTLs for that trait; (2) Through molecular markers it is also\npossible to reduce the burden of linkage drag when the desir-\nable traits are attempted to transfer from wild species or their\nderivatives into improved varieties. Systematic introgression of\nentire genome of a wild species into cultivated background is\nalso possible by use of molecular markers, which is referred to\nas genome-wide introgression (GWI). Following this approach,\nit is possible to develop chromosome segment substitution lines\n(CSSLs) and advanced back-cross (AB)-QTL (AB-QTL) map-\nping populations which enable tapping of new alleles from wild\nspecies (T anksley and Nelson, 1996). More details on these two\napproaches are given in Section “Emerging Genomics and Breed-\ning Approaches”; (3) Optimum utilization of time and resources\nas several unwanted plants/progenies are rejected in early gener-\nations and also possibly at early growth stages of the plant based\non the genotype data; (4) Phenotyping is not required in every\ngeneration as the plants/progenies can be advanced based on the\ngenotypic data, and thus phenotyping can be postponed to later\ngenerations when non-segregating lines are derived. This results\nin drastic cut in the cost of phenotyping as well as increased\nefﬁciency of phenotyping when relatively less number of lines\nare needed to be evaluated; (5) Selection and advancing of the\nplants/progenies when done based on the genotyping data will\neliminate the problem associated with chance failure of pheno-\ntype screen and chance escapes, which occur often with ﬁeld\nscreening. Molecular markers are unaffected by environmental\nﬂuctuations and hence, serve as reliable tags to track the target\ntraits/genomic regions in breeding populations; (6) It is possi-\nble to improve an elite/popular cultivar for a target trait through\nmarker-assisted back-crossing (MABC). Although back-crossing\nis a known method of breeding its utility in groundnut improve-\nment remained meager till the advent of molecular technologies\nand there is renewed interest in this method of breeding through\nMABC; (7) It saves time signiﬁcantly when recessive genes need\nto introgress/pyramid which is need of the hour in order to\ndevelop improved cultivars in shorter period of time; and (8)\nGene pyramiding, i.e., targeting multiple traits is possible through\nmolecular breeding as each of the target trait can be tracked simul-\ntaneously in the segregating populations though QTLs and/or\nmarkers.\nMarker-assisted back-crossing has been the most preferred and\nresult oriented molecular breeding approach for improving exist-\ning popular genotype for one or two traits and pyramiding of few\ngenes/QTLs. Most importantly, MABC is now in routine use in\ndevelopment of near-isogenic lines (NILs) or CSSLs for genomics\nresearch. The limitation of this approach is its inability to handle\nmultiple traits/QTLs/genes in one attempt due to requirement of\nlarge back-cross populations which becomes unmanageable (Rib-\naut and Hoisington, 1998; V arshney et al., 2012). Since, majority\nof the economically important traits are quantitative in nature and\nis governed by several genomics regions (genes/QTLs) distributed\non plant genome and contribution of each is very small. Hence to\nimprove such complex traits such as drought tolerance and seed\nyield wherein QTL analysis ends up with identiﬁcation of several\nsmall-effect QTLs (Ravi et al., 2011; Gautami et al., 2012), a better\nwww.frontiersin.org February 2013| Volume 4| Article 23 | 9\n“fpls-04-00023” — 2013/2/21 — 17:49 — page 10 — #10\nJanila et al. Groundnut: genetic and genomic tools\nmolecular breeding approach called marker-assisted recurrent\nselection (MARS) has been proposed (Ribaut and Ragor, 2007)\nwhich can target more number of minor as well as major QTLs.\nMARS involves estimation of marker effects followed by two or\nthree recombination cycles based on presence of marker alleles for\nsmall-effect QTLs (Bernardo and Charcosset, 2006; Eathington\net al., 2007). Currently in groundnut, MABC is used for improve-\nment of resistance to foliar fungal diseases, root-knot nematode\nand enhance oil quality for which linked markers for QTLs with\nhigh phenotypic effect were successfully identiﬁed. While, for\nimprovement of drought tolerance in groundnut MARS was the\nsuggested method of breeding as more than 100 main and epistatic\neffect QTLs were reported, it is not attempted due to lack of dense\nlinkage maps in groundnut that limits the applicability of MARS\n(Ravi et al., 2011).\nMARKERS FOR TARGET TRAITS\nBefore the linkage maps were made available, bulk segregant anal-\nysis (BSA) was used to identify the linked markers for nematode\nresistance (Burrow et al., 1996; Garcia et al., 1996), aphid vector\nof GRD (Herselman et al., 2004), and yield and yield parameters\n(Selvaraj et al., 2009). But the approach of identifying markers\nfor targets traits swiftly changed with the development of linkage\nmaps in groundnut (see Pandey et al., 2012b). QTL analysis was\nused for identiﬁcation of QTLs for several important traits such as\ndrought tolerance related traits (V arshney et al., 2009; Ravi et al.,\n2011; Gautami et al., 2012), resistance to foliar disease (Khedikar\net al., 2010; Mondal et al., 2012; Sujay et al., 2012), and nutritional\nquality traits (Chen et al., 2010; Chu et al., 2011; Sarvamangala\net al., 2011) were reported. The availability of genomic resources\nsuch as molecular markers, genetic and physical maps, expressed\nsequence tags (EST s), mutant resources, and functional genomics\nplatforms that facilitate the identiﬁcation of QTLs and discov-\nery of genes associated with tolerance/resistance to abiotic and\nbiotic stresses and agronomic traits was reviewed (Holbrook et al.,\n2011; Pandey et al., 2012b). Identiﬁcation of target markers to\ntraits of economic importance has enabled integration of molec-\nular breeding in groundnut improvement as will be discussed in\nthe following section.\nONGOING MOLECULAR BREEDING ACTIVITIES FOR GROUNDNUT\nIMPROVEMENT\nDespite several possibilities to overcome the bottlenecks of con-\nventional breeding and some demonstrated successes in other\ncrops including groundnut, the uptake of molecular breeding\napproaches in groundnut improvement programs in developed\ncountries is contrasting with that in developing countries such as\nIndia and African countries. This may in be in part due to lack\nof infrastructure, high cost of genotyping, and human capac-\nities available in the developing countries. The progress made\nwhen molecular breeding was integrated with conventional pro-\ncedures in development of improved groundnut varieties was\nquite impressive. Holbrook et al. (2011) reviewed the impact of\nmolecular genetic research, both genomic and transgenic tools on\ngroundnut cultivar development. In this section we dwell upon\nsome examples of its successful deployment. The ﬁrst groundnut\nvariety developed through integrated marker-assisted selection\n(MAS) in the USA is NemaTAM, a root-knot nematode-resistant\nvariety (Simpson et al., 2003). However this was susceptible to\nTSWV . Subsequently a cultivar named, Tifguard, bred through\nconventional breeding method with resistance to both TSWV and\nroot-knot nematode was released for cultivation in the country\n(Holbrook et al., 2008). Following marker-assisted breeding, “Tif-\nguard High O/L ” cultivar was developed through three rounds of\naccelerated back-crossing to pyramid nematode resistance and the\ntrait for high oleic:linoleic acid (high O:L) ratio in seeds (Chu et al.,\n2011). In this MABC program, Tifguard was used as recurrent\nparent.\nAt ICRISA T , one of the goals of breeding program is to develop\nhigh yielding varieties with resistance to rust and LLS. After\nidentiﬁcation of a major QTL (QTL\nrust 01) contributing up to\n82.96% phenotypic variation for rust resistance, it was intro-\ngressed through MABC to improve three popular groundnut\nvarieties (ICGV 91114, JL 24, and TAG 24) for rust resistance\nusing GPBD 4 as a donor genotype. Several promising introgres-\nsion lines with remarkable reduction in disease spread and other\ndesirable agronomic traits have been selected for further multipli-\ncation and generation advancement (Pandey et al., 2012a). The\npromising genotypes with desirable yield potential and higher\nresistance to leaf rust could be released as improved varieties.\nMABC is also in progress for introgression of mutant fatty acid\ndehydrogenase (FAD) alleles on A and B genomes that govern\nhigh oleate trait (high oleic to linoleic acid ratio) that imparts high\nquality of oil beneﬁting both, consumers health and food process-\ning industries (through enhanced shelf-life). The elite breeding\nlines with high oil content (>55%) and stable performance have\nbeen targeted for improvement of oil quality (Janila et al., 2012).\nIn addition, gene pyramiding has also been initiated targeting\none major QTL each for rust and LLS resistance after identiﬁ-\ncation of major QTL for LLS resistance on AhXII that explains\nup to 62% of phenotypic variation from the same donor (Sujay\net al., 2012).\nInitiatives have been also taken at Chiba Prefectural Agriculture\nand Forestry Research Center in Japan, for marker-assisted intro-\ngression of mutant FAD2 alleles into an elite cultivar “Nakateyu-\ntaka” using a breeding line “YI-0311” as donor which had an O/L\nr a t i oo f4 8(Koilkonda et al., 2012). Nakateyutaka, a Virginia type is\na leading variety in Japan and has normal O/L ratio. TheahFAD2A\nand ahFAD2b mutant alleles of the genotype YI-0311 were same\nas the previously reported mutational alleles found on high O/L\ngroundnut genotypes (Jung et al., 2000) and used by Chu et al.\n(2011) in their MABC program. In addition to these ongoing\nmolecular breeding activities the national programs for groundnut\nimprovement in China and India have also initiated deployment\nof molecular breeding. The next decade may probably witness a\ngood number of groundnut varieties developed though integrated\nmolecular breeding approaches.\nTOOLS TO TAP ALLELES FROM WILD SPECIES\nGenetic variability holds the key for the success of breeding pro-\ngram and groundnut has a twofold problem in this respect: ﬁrst\nis the low genetic variability due its nature of origin, and sec-\nond, the reproductive isolation from its wild diploid species due\nto ploidy differences and sterility. WildArachis species are known\nFrontiers in Plant Science| Plant Genetics and Genomics February 2013| Volume 4| Article 23 | 10\n“fpls-04-00023” — 2013/2/21 — 17:49 — page 1 1 — #1 1\nJanila et al. Groundnut: genetic and genomic tools\nas repositories of several desirable alleles, however, wider use of\nwild species in breeding has been hampered by ploidy and sex-\nual incompatibility barriers, by linkage drag, and historically,\nby a lack of the tools needed to conventionally conﬁrm hybrid\nidentities and track introgressed chromosomal segments (Bertioli\net al., 2011). They remain under-utilized due to burden of linkage\ndrag although the crossing barriers are to some extent overcome\nthrough techniques of wide hybridization. GWI and AB-QTL\nmapping are two important molecular marker-based approaches\nthat enable enhanced utilization of alleles from wild species. GWI\nof a small genomic region from wild species while keeping the\ngenetic background of the cultivated genotype is a good means\nto explore the largely untapped reservoir of useful alleles of inter-\nest in wild species. This is espe cially interesting in species like\ngroundnut with narrow genetic base. This approach has been\nwidely utilized for introgression of favorable QTLs for various\ntraits in other crops such as tomato, rice, wheat, and barley (Frid-\nman et al., 2004; W ang et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Schmalenbach\net al., 2009). AB-QTL mapping facilitates simultaneous discover\nof QTLs and development of elite genotypes (T anksley and Nel-\nson, 1996). AB-QTL mapping was used in tomato to breed an elite\nprocessing line (T anksley et al., 1996). In groundnut,Foncéka et al.\n(2009) used AB-QTL approach to develop a genetic linkage map\nof wild genome introgression into cultivated background through\nutilization of synthetic amphidiploid betweenA. duranensisand A.\nipaensis, and also derived CSSLs and AB populations. The CSSLs\nand AB populations facilitate characterization of different seg-\nments of genome of wild species contributing for resistance to\nfoliar diseases and/or any other desirable trait. Once these differ-\nent segments and their roles are determined, it is then possible\nto track them along the back-crosses using molecular markers\nfor use in breeding programs. AB-QTL populations are also under\ndevelopment at ICRISA T . More recently, development of synthetic\namphidiploids (Foncéka et al., 2009; Mallikarjuna et al., 2011) can\nfacilitate better utilization of wild species in breeding programs as\nuse of synthetic amphidiploids circumvent the crossing barriers\nbetween wild and cultivated species.\nEMERGING GENOMICS AND BREEDING APPROACHES\nGENOME SEQUENCE DATABASE\nBecause of large genome size and amphidiploid nature the genome\nand heavy costs associated, it was not possible earlier to initiate\ngenome sequencing. However due to advances in next generation\nsequencing and coordination of large number of partners, Peanut\nGenome Project (PGP)\n2 has been initiated recently with spe-\nciﬁc goals for sequencing the groundnut genome and developing\ngenomic resources for use in groundnut improvement programs\n(see Pandey et al., 2012b ). It is expected that draft genome\nsequence and extensive genomic and transcriptome information\nwill be available soon that will enable deployment of modern\ngenotyping approaches such as genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS).\nGBS is expected to make genotyping costs cheaper and faster and\naccessible to a broad groundnut community. As a result, for trait\nmapping, genome-wide association studies (GW AS) will be in\nroutine in coming years in groundnut breeding.\n2 http://www.peanutbioscience.com/peanutgenomeproject.html\nGENOMIC SELECTION\nBoth MABC and MARS requires development of family map-\nping populations and identiﬁcation of QTLs/marker effects before\ngetting into the main stages of improvement programs. Further\ndue to difﬁculty in handling polygenic traits and sometimes in\ndevelopment of good mapping populations, a better approach\ncalled “genomic selection (GS)” is fast emerging as a molecular\nbreeding approach for crop improvement. Identiﬁcation of supe-\nrior lines with higher breeding value (genomic-estimated breeding\nvalues, GEBVs) in segregating breeding populations based on\ngenome-wide marker proﬁle data is the ﬁrst step toward using\nthis approach. T o do so, a training population (TP) comprised of\nelite breeding lines for which multiple-season phenotyping data\non agronomically important traits are available across environ-\nments is required for estimating GEBVs. Parental genotypes are\nthen selected based on GEBVs and crosses are effected to develop\ncandidate population (CP). In other words, CP is developed from\nthe crosses made using the lines with best GEBVs in the TP as par-\nents (V arshney et al., 2013). GS is now preferred over MABC and\nMARS for improving complex traits as GS has the advantage of\nselecting lines based on entire genome rather than one/few small\nsegment of genome. It also enjoys the beneﬁts of MABC and MARS\nby affecting selections based on genotype and prior of extensive\nphenotyping thus saving time and resources (Jannink et al., 2010).\nIn order to exploit the recent advances in groundnut genomics to\nimprove complex traits such as drought tolerance and seed yield,\nefforts have been initiated at ICRISA T to apply GS. In this direc-\ntion, a TP has been developed that includes about 300 advanced\nbreeding lines for which historical data on their performance have\nalready been compiled.\nSUMMARY\nThe conventional breeding approaches have largely utilized the\navailable genetic variability in cultivated groundnut and to some\nextent the variability trapped in wildArachis species was also used\nto develop improved groundnut varieties. The breeding proce-\ndures used for self-pollinated crops are employed in groundnut\nimprovement programs along with use of phenotyping tools.\nIdentifying and assessing the nature of variability for target traits,\nutilizing the sources of variability as parents in hybridization,\nand advancing the best possible genotypes after selection are the\nkey steps in the groundnut breeding programs. Pedigree, bulk-\npedigree, and single seed decent methods are followed to handle\nsegregating population after hybridizing two parents. Following\nconventional approaches, several improved groundnut varieties\nwith high yield and tolerance/resistance to foliar fungal diseases,\nbacterial wilt, root-knot nematode, virus, rosette diseases, and\ndrought were released for cultivation. The released varieties have\na wide range of maturity duration, ranging between 90 and over\n150 days required for cultivation in various growing regions with\nvarying LGP . They belonged to different market types,viz, Span-\nish, Virginia, and V alencia and meet market uses (oil and food\nuses) and agro-climatic requirements.\nThe last decade has witnessed development of molecular\nmarker linkage maps in groundnut that was followed by iden-\ntiﬁcation of markers and QTLs for target traits. This paved\nway for deployment of molecular tools in breeding program for\nwww.frontiersin.org February 2013| Volume 4| Article 23 | 11\n“fpls-04-00023” — 2013/2/21 — 17:49 — page 12 — #12\nJanila et al. Groundnut: genetic and genomic tools\nefﬁcient utilization of time and resources and improved efﬁciency\nof breeding. As a consequence, the extensive breeding programs\nare becoming intensive with the use of molecular breeding tools.\nMarker technologies offer approaches (GWI and AB-QTL map-\nping) that enable tapping of new alleles from wildArachis species\nthat remain under-utilized. T argeting multiple traits (gene pyra-\nmiding) is another important possibility of molecular breeding\napproaches. Groundnut breeding programs in USA, China, India,\nand Japan have already embarked the new technology to com-\nplement the ongoing breeding programs. “NemaTAM” is the ﬁrst\ncultivar developed through molecular breeding for resistance to\nroot-knot nematode. This was followed by “Tifguard High O/L ”\nthat has high O/L ratio and multiple resistances. At ICRISA T ,\nMABC is underway to develop cultivars with rust resistance that\nare now in advance generations and also pyramid resistance to\nrust and LLS. MABC for improvement of oil quality is underway\nat USA, Japan, and India. The uptake of molecular breeding tools\nin groundnut breeding programs in developed countries is con-\ntrasting with developing countries like India and African countries,\nwhich is in part due to inadequate infrastructure, high genotyping\ncosts, and inadequate human capacities in the later. On the other\nhand, more efﬁcient genomic tools are under development, and\nthis is expected to happen more rapidly once the draft genome\nsequence is available.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors profoundly acknowledge the ﬁnancial assistance\nreceived from CGIAR Generation Challenge Programme (GCP)\nand Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) through T ropi-\ncal Legumes-I (GCP , BMGF) and T ropical Legumes-II (BMGF)\nprojects for supporting the development and deployment of\ngenomic tools and genetic resources as well as breeding and\nextension activities, and its national partners in South-Asia and\nSub-Saharan Africa.\nREFERENCES\nAmin, P .
