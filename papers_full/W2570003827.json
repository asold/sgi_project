The catalyzing effect of \nwater in the degradation process of paper and pressboard has been studied by several authors who have \nfound relations \nor models to estimate how the ageing process would be accelerated in presence of different \namounts of water [1].  \n \n  In [2,3] Lelekakis performed an experimental study in which samples with different moisture contents \nwere ag\ned in presence of mineral oil (MO). In [3] Lelekakis used his experimental data to find an equation \nto determine\n the loss of life of an insulation subjected to temperature and with a certain moisture content \n(MC).  \n \nFrom the last de\ncade, natural and synthetic esters have started to be seen as an alternative MO [6]. These \nmaterials present some superior properties from the point of view of fire safety and biodegradability, what \nare important advantages, especially for transformers in residential areas or railway transformers. The use \nof these liquids is becoming habitual in distribution transformers although they are not so often applied in \npower transformers. \n \nA vast majority of the published works on the topic of transformer-solid-insulation ageing are devoted to \nthe analysis of the processes taking place on cellulosic insulations immersed in MO [1-5]. However, in the \nlast years some authors have performed ageing tests to analyze the processes that take place when the \ninsulating fluids are natural or synthetic esters.  \nThis article presents an experimental study devoted to analyze the influence of the moisture content \nof solid insulation in the transformer ageing process for transformers insulated with natural esters. \nAging experiments were conducted on samples conditioned with different moisture contents \nimmersed in a natural ester and in mireral oil.The physical processes involved in the degradation of \npaper in presence of these fluids are discussed at the light of the experimental findings.  \n \n \n \nOne of the problems of these fluids is that they have a relatively high viscosity, compared to MO, being \nthus their performance as refrigerating agents worse than that of MO. In consequence, the use of esters \ncould lead to higher values for hottest spot temperature for a certain loading profile and ambient \ntemperature. An increase on hot spot operating temperature would lead to shorten the transformer life. \n \nIn the last \nyears, several studies have been conducted, to clarify the ageing process of solid insulation \nwhen it \nis immersed in alternative insulating fluids, and authors agree in the fact that the ageing rate of \npaper in presence of a natural ester (NE) is lower than that in MO. This fact could suggest that even \nalthough hot \nspot temperature in NE is higher, the solid insulation degradation rate associated to it is not as \nhigh as it\n would be in case the transformer was insulated with MO. Oommen in [7]  claims that a \ntransformer insulated with a NE could admit an increase in the hot spot temperature of 15ºC without an \nexcessive ageing. \n \nSome authors ha\nve suggested that the good performance of solid insulation immersed in ester fluids is \nlinked to the fact that these fluids are much more hydrophilic and then water is absorbed by oil keepin g \nthus the solid \ninsulation dryer. Transesterification and hydrolysis reactions have also been pointed out as \nelements that limit the ageing rate of paper impregnated with esters [6-17].  \n \nIn this wo\nrk, a laboratory study has been carried out to determine the effect of moisture in the ageing \nprocess o\nf NE impregnated paper. Samples of solid insulation conditioned to different MC were su bjected \nto accelerated ageing in presence of MO and in  NE. The degree of polymerization of the paper and the MC \nof pape\nr and oil was monitored throughout the tests.  \n \nThe expe\nrimental stage consider ed three different initial MC’s of paper and three testing temperatures . \nUnlike the majority of previously published works, the present study considers the presence of cooper in \nthe testing vials, aiming to reproduce the ageing conditions of real transformer s’ insulation. An analysis of \nthe physical phenomena involved in the ageing process of NE immer sed paper, and the aspects that \ndifferentiate that case from the ageing of the MO immersed paper, is presented in the article.  \n \nExperimenta\nl study \n \nAn experimental study was performed to get insight about the influence of the MC of solid insulation in \nits \nageing process; another aim of the study was to understand the influence of the type of insulating fluid \nin the agein\ng rate.  \n \nTest were performed on samples preconditioned with different MC subjected to accelerated ageing at \nthree differe\nnt temperatures. The evolution of the ageing process was monitored by analyzing the degree of \npolymeriza\ntion of paper (DP) and different markers in oil, such as the furanic compounds, water and gases. \nThe evolution of the MC in pape\nr (MP) was also registered.   \n \nAgeing tests\n were conducted at temperatures 110, 120 and 130 ºC, considering an ageing time of up to 12 \nweeks. The t\nests were done in glass vials containing oil, copper and paper with different MC, as will be \nexplaine\nd next.  \n \n \n \n \n \nMaterials used in the ageing tests  \n \nThe Kraft pa\nper used in the study was extracted from a paper-insulated copper conductor wire. The \ncopper conductor was unwrapped and the insulation paper was placed in glass vials for the accelerated \nageing proc\ness (Fig. 1). The  properties of the paper before the test are shown in Table 1. \n \n       \nFigure 1.  Specimens of insulated flat wire and Kraft paper. \n \nTable 1. Propertie\ns of the paper used in the experimental study \n \nPAPER PROPERTIES  \nType Kraft paper \nThickness 50 m \nTemperature index 105ºC \n \nThe paper samples were introduced in glass vials of 125 ml filled with 100 ml of new dry NE or MO. \nThe NE and MO use\nd in the study were Biotemp, manufactured by ABB, and Nytro Taurus, by Nynas. \nAiming to reproduce the ageing conditions of transformer solid insulation, copper was also introduced in \nthe vials. One stripe of pape\nr-insulated copper conductor was use to avoid an excessive contact with the \nfluid. It is important to note that coper is not included in most of the ageing studies reported in literature \nalthough \nIEEE Standard C57.100-2011 “Test Procedure for Thermal Evaluation of Insulation Systems for \nLiquid-Immersed Distribution and Power Transformers” [17] recommends its inclusion to achieve an \nadequate e\nvaluation of the solid insulation performance. The amounts of paper, oil and cooper introduced \nin each vial are shown in \nTable 2.  \n \nTable 2. Proportions of the different materials used in the ageing tests. The masses of fluids are not \nreflected\n in the table, since they depend on temperature and type of liquid.  \n \n Amount Mass (g) \nPaper 12 strips  3.13 \nOil 100 ml - \nCopper 1 conductor 8.6 \n \nPreparation of the samples \n \nThe preparation of the test specimens involved a first stage of paper drying. Different drying times were \napplied to get different initial moisture levels. Drying was performed at 70ºC and under vacuum of 1mbar \nto avoid pre-ageing of the samples.  \n \nThe test specime\nns were dried inside the vials, to avoid contamination of the paper, and impregnated with \nnew and degassed MO or NE just after extracting the vials from the oven. The vials were sealed with \nPTFE-sil\nicone septum and stored until the beginning of the test. The contact between oil and air was also \n\n \nconsidered, as happens in free-breathing transformers. To this end, a small head of air was left at the top of \nthe vials (Fig 2). Three different moisture levels were prepared for every testing temperature.  \n \n \nFigure 2. Specimens und\ner test. \n \nA total number of 396 via\nls were prepared corresponding to three moisture levels, three ageing \ntemperatures, \nseven or thirteen sampling times and two different fluids (NE or MO). Every measuring point \nwas tested duplicate (i.e. \ntwo vials per point). After the preparation stage, the initial samples were analyzed \nto determine their MC, paper DP and the initial condition of the oil.  \n \nIt must be pointed out t\nhat, although all the samples were prepared following the same procedure, they \nwere prepared in several stages and the initial values of moisture of the different tests were in some cases \nslightly different.  \n \nTest procedure \n \nAgeing tests were performed in a laboratory oven under temperatures of 110, 120 and 130ºC during 12 \nor 6 weeks. Two vials were extracted every seven days to be analyzed in the laboratory. The DP and the \nwater content of paper were determined according to standards IEC-60450 [19] and IEC-60814  [20]. Oil \nsamples were\n also taken to measure the dissolved gases, moisture in oil and the furanic compounds \ngeneration throughout the test, although the evolution of those markers has not been included in this article.  \n \nResults \n \nThe results of the ageing tests carried out on NE and MO immersed paper are presented next. The \ninfluence of the temperature and the MC on the ageing rate of paper are firstly discussed. Afterwards the \nevolution of the MC of paper and oil is analyzed, aiming to understand the differences on the ageing \nprocesses of the\n two materials.  \n \nInflue\nnce of temperature and moisture in the insulation-ageing rate \n  \nThere is \na general agreement on temperature is the main factor of influence on the solid insulation-ageing \nrate. Fig\n.3 shows the evolution of the DP of cellulose for samples aged with an initial MC 1% for the three \ntested temperatures during 12 weeks. Each point on the graph corresponds to the results obtained on paper \nsamples e\nxtracted from vials that had remained in the ageing oven for the specified number of hours. At \nleast two determinations of the DP were done on paper samples extracted from each vial, being the points \nshown in the gra\nph the average value of these determinations.  \n \nAs was expected, there is a mayor influence of temperature in the ageing process. It must be observed \nthat in the three\n cases the DP of paper drops fast during the first month of ageing, but then the DP of paper \nstabilizes keeping a stable value until the end of the test. The same ageing pattern was observed for all the \n\n \nageing tests performed on NE immersed samples. In all cases, an initial period of fast degradation was \nfollowed by a stabilization of the paper DP.  \n \nFigure 3.  Evolution of the DP of NE immersed paper subjected to accelerated ageing at temperatures 110, \n120 and 130 ºC. Initial MC of the paper samples 1%. \n \nFig. 4 show\ns the influence of the initial MC of paper on the evolution of the DP when paper ages \nimmersed in \nNE at 130 ºC for 12 weeks. As can be seen, the initial MC of paper has a certain influence on \nthe ageing\n rate at the beginning of the process, although the final DP is very similar regardless the initial \nMC of paper. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the DP for MO immersed paper samples prepared with different  \ninitial MC and aged for 6 weeks at temperature 130ºC. As can be seen the ageing rate is much more \ninfluenced b\ny the initial MC of the samples in this case.  It is also important to note that the DP drop of the \nsamples aged in MO continues until the end of the test instead  of stabilizing as in the case of ageing in NE. \nTable 3 summarizes the results of the whole set of tests.  \n \n \nFigure 4.

It is \ninteresting to note how the moisture of paper decrease sharply as the test progress es, especially for the \nsamples that were wetter at the beginning of the experiment. The decrease is not so noticeable in the case of \nthe samples with lowe\nr moistures, especially in the sample with MC 1%.  \n0 200 400 600 800 10000\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\nTime (hours)\nDP\n \n \nMC=1 %\nMC=1.7 %\nMC=2.7 %\n \n \n \nFigure 6: Evolution of the MC in paper during the 12 weeks of ageing at 130ºC in presence of NE, for \nsamples with differe\nnt initial MC in paper. \n \nSeveral \nauthors claim that the cause of the lower ageing rate of cellulosic insulation immersed in NE is \nthe absorption of water by oil [6, 7, 17]. However, the analysis of the evolution of the MC of oil (F ig. 7) \nreveals that there is an additional process that causes a drop of the water dissolved in oil too. As shown in \nFig. 7, the \nMC of oil increases at the beginning of the test because of the migration of water from paper to \noil. That mi\ngration is probably responsible for the reduction of moisture in paper from the first to the \nsecond measuring point (from 2.7 to 2.1% in the case of the samples with higher MC). However, a sharp \nreduction of the MC of paper can be observed after 300 h of ageing, and at this point of the test the water \ncontent of oil also decreases \nat a very high rate.  \n \n \n \nFigure 7: Evolution of the MC in the NE fluid during the 130ºC test for different initial MC of paper. \n0 500 1000 1500 20000\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\nTime (h)\nMoisture in paper (%)\n \n \nMC=1 %\nMC=1.7 %\nMC=2.7 %\n0 500 1000 1500 20000\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nTime (h)\nMoisture in oil (ppm)\n \n \nMC=1 %\nMC=1.7 %\nMC=2.7 %\n \nFrom Figs. 6 and 7 results clear that a big amount of water is being consumed as a part of the ageing \nprocess of the cellulosic material when it is immersed in the NE. The total mass of water in each vial can be \ncalculated using\n equation (1).  \n \n𝑚𝑤𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙(𝑔) =\n𝑀𝐶𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟(%)·𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟(𝑔)\n100 +\n𝑀𝐶𝑜𝑖𝑙(𝑝𝑝𝑚)·𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑙(𝑔)\n1.000.000      (1) \n \nWhere mwtotal is the total mass of water in the vial in grams, MCpaper and MCo il are the MC in paper and \nthe MC in oil in percentage and ppm respectively and mpaper and moil are the masses of paper and oil \ninside the vials expressed in grams.  \n \nThe evolution \nof the total mass of water along the 130 ºC ageing test, calculated according to eq. (1), is \nplotted in F\nig. 8. As can be seen, the moisture decrease in all cases, even though the sharpest drop can be \nobserved for higher MC. \nThe final mass of water is almost the same despite the initial MC in paper.  \n \n \nFigure 8: Evolution of the total\n mass of water inside the NE vial throughout the ageing period at 130 ºC. \n \nIt should be\n added that the rate of water consumption grows with temperature. Fig. 9 shows the total \nmass of water \nin the three tests carried out on samples with MC 2.7 % a t 110 and 130 ºC. As can be seen, a \nmuch greater reduction appear when the ageing process is conducted at 130 ºC. \n \nIn order \nto find out whether the same phenomena happens on the samples aged in presence of MO, the \nevolution of the water content in the vials was obtained for the tests carried out in MO. As shown in Fig. \n10, the water content inside the vial does not drop during the test in the case of ageing the paper in presence \nof MO. A simil\nar tendency is observed for the three-tested initial MC and for the different ageing \ntemperatures. \n \nAlthough it has been traditionally claimed that the ageing reactions of cellulosic insulation have water as \na by-product [1] and that the increase in the water levels that a transformer suffers during its life is partially \ncaused by this generation of water, no significant generation of water was observed in these tests. Other \nauthors have found the same result in their analysis [2, 21, 22].  \n0 500 1000 1500 20000\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\nTime (h)\nTotal mass of water (g)\n \n \nMC=1 %\nMC=1.7 %\nMC=2.7 %\n \n  \nFigure 9: Evolution of the total mass of water for samples with initial MC 2.7 %, aged at 110 and 130 \nºC. \n \n \nFigure 10: Evolution of\n the total mass of water (g) throughout the experiment.

As will be \nexplained in \nthis section the experimental results presented in this work can be justified considering the \nchemical reactions involved in the process. As a summary of those results,  the following points should be \nhighlighted:  \n \n1. The ageing process of NE and MO- immersed samples w as studied at different temperatures and \ninitial MC.

The initial MC of the samples is a factor with a great influence on the ageing rate in the case of \nMO-\nimmersed samples, but not such an important one in NE immersed samples.  \n3. There is a very clear decrease of water content of the oil-paper system when paper ages immersed in \nNE. The re\nduction is sharper for higher temperatures and MC. On the other hand, the water content \nof the sa\nmples that age immersed in MO remains nearly constant for the whole ageing period for all \nthe temperatures and MC tested. \n \nThere are\n three aspects that differentiate the ageing phenomena of NE-immersed paper from that taking \nplace in presence of MO: The different moisture equilibrium condition between oil and paper, the \nhydrolysis reactions of the ester fluid and the transesterification of cellulose. The three mechanisms and \ntheir impact in the ageing process of paper are explained below. \n \nEquilibrium condition \n \nNE accepts greater amounts of water in solution than MO. IEEE Std C57.147-2008 [23] provides a \ncomparison for \nthe typical amounts of water accepted by NE and MO as a function of temperature (Fig. \n11). The\n larger water solubility of ester provokes a displacement of the moisture equilibrium condition \nbetween p\naper and oil, which is shifted towards the ester. In terms of the ageing process, this fact provokes \na higher migration of moisture from the paper to the NE, and in consequence, the moisture of the NE \nreaches high values at some points of the experiment (Fig. 7). This effect is especially noticeable in the \ncase of highly moisturized paper aged at high temperatures. \n \n \n \nFigure 11: Typical amounts of\n water accepted by NE and MO in solution as a function of temperature. \nTaken from [23]\n. \n \n \nHydrolysis of esters \n \nSurprisingl\ny, the main difference between the ageing processes of NE and MO-immersed paper lies on \nthe characteristic ageing processes of both fluids. While MO ages mainly via oxidation, the predominant \nchemical reaction on NE subjected to high temperatures is hydrolysis [16]. Hydrolysis reaction of esters is \n\n \nschematized in Figure 12. As can be seen, the hydrolysis of a triglyceride consumes three water molecules \nand releases one molecule of glycerol and three long chain fatty acids.  \n \nHydroly\nsis reactions are catalyzed by temperature and moisture. This agrees with the experimental \nevidences presented in this article, where the higher consumptions of water are observed on the \nexperiments \nperformed at high er temperatures and MC (Fig. 7). As water dissolved in the ester fluid is \nconsumed by hydrolysis, a furthe r disequilibrium of water appears which causes a further migration of \nwater from paper to oil. This is the cause of the overall water decreasing shown in Figs. 6 to 9. \n \nFigure 12: Hydrolysis\n reaction of esters \n \nTransesterification   \n \nThe long c\nhain fatty acids released as a byproduct of the hydrolysis reactions in the NE tend form bounds \nwith the cellulose in a process called transesterification, which consists of the substitution of reactive OH \ngroups of glucose molecules with fatty acids (Fig. 13).  Transesterification has been experimentally \nobserved by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) [11], and studied with molecular simulation [16].  \n \nTr\nansesterification of glucose monomers slows down the depolymerization process in cellulosic \ninsulation since it hinders the cleavage of esterified glucose monomers from the chains. Fig. 14 shows the \ncleavage process of a non-esterified glucose chain. As can be seen the process consists of three stages: \nfirstly an OH group reacts with a H group of the adjacent Carbone generating a water molecule; then an \nalcohol is transformed in a ketone by an oxidation process (i.e. the hydrogen of the OH group is displaced \ntowards the Carbon\ne denoted as C1 breaking the double bound with C2); finally the CH2OH group reacts \nwith the oxygen that links the glucose molecules breaking the chain [22]. In the case of transesterified \nglucose molec\nules, the reactive group CH2OH, is blocked by the presence of fatty acids and thus the \nreaction stops on the second step, preventing the chain from being broken.  \n \n\n \n \nFigure 13: Transesterification of cellulose chains \n \n \nFigure 14: Cleavage of cellulose chains \n \nAnal\nysis of the global process  \n \nFigure 15 summarizes the ageing process of ester-immersed solid insulation. As was explained, two \nprocesses slow down the ageing rate in the case of NE immersed paper, the consumption of water provoked \nby the hydrolysis reactions of the ester, and the slowing down of the ageing rate due to the \ntransesterifica\ntion of cellulose. Additionally, the higher water solubility of the ester fluids allows a larger \n\n \nmigration of water from the paper to the ester, what catalyzes the hydrolysis reactions and allows the solid \ninsulation to remain dryer. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 15: Schematic of the ageing process of ester-immersed paper. MCP: Moisture content of paper, \nMCE: Moisture\n content of ester. \n  \nConclusions \n \nIn this work, the ageing process of NE immersed paper has been studied and compared with the process \nthat takes place on MO immersed insulation. The investigation is focused in determining the influence of \nthe initial water content of the samples in the process. Ageing tests were performed on paper samples \nconditioned to different moisture levels . In the case of ester -immersed samples, a sharp water consumption \nwas observed as the ageing p rocess progress. Water consumption was greater when the ageing temperature \nand water\n content in paper increased. On the other hand, no significant water consumption or generation \nwas observed in MO immersed samples.  \n \nPaper-ester\nsystem in\nequilibrium\nT increases\nMoisture migration\nfrom paper to oil\nMCP drops\nMCE rises\nHydrolisis of ester\nMoisture\ndisequilibrium\nbetween paper and\nester\nEster with high\nMC and hight T\nGeneration\nLong chain fatty acids\nCompsumption\nWater\nTransesterification\nof cellulose\nDry-esterified paper\nLOW AGEING\nRATE\n \nA theoretical analysis has been presented to explain the chemical reactions that takes place in the ageing \nprocess of ester immersed paper, aiming to explain the why this kind of insulation presents superior \nproperties in relation to thermal degradation. Further work is needed to analyze the reaction rates of \nhydrolysis and transesterification processes. The effect of the acids generated during the hydrolysis of \nesters is another aspect to be addressed in the future. \n \nAcknow\nledg\nement  \n \nThis work was supported by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain through the projects \nDPI2012-35819 and DPI2015-71219-C2- 2-R, and by CEIS.
