INTRODUCTION\nPower transformers are one of the key and most valuable components in a power system. \nEquipping them with an on-line monitoring system is essential for information gathering, \ncondition assessment, better management and decision making. The worldwide transformer \nreliability survey conducted by CIGRE WG A2.37 and published in [1], collected and analysed \n964 major failures which occurred in the period 1996 to 2010, within a total population of \n167,459 transformer-years, contributed by 58 utilities from 21 countries. The results point out \nthe main causes of transformer failures, including the reasons with most severe results such as \nfire or explosion. Fig. 1 shows the failure location analysis according to transformer application \nin units with voltages 100 kV and above, respectively. The number of failures classified as \n‘unknown’ location was 17%, and these ‘unknown’ cases were not considered in the analysis. \nThe failure mode analysis [2] according to application is shown in Fig.1. Windings, tap changer \nand bushing related failures were the major contributors followed by lead exit insulation related \nfailures irrespective of application or manufacturing period. The failure mode analysis [2] \naccording to application is shown in Fig. 2. Dielectric mode failures were the most prominent, \nfollowed by mechanical and electrical type failures, for substation transformers, whereas \ngenerator step-up transformers had higher contributions of thermal and dielectric mode failures.\nFigure 1. Failure location of substation \ntransformers (536 failures) and generator \nstep-up units (127 failures) \nFigure 2. Failure mode analysis of substation \ntransformers (799 failures) and generator \nstep-up units (165 failures) \nAs can be seen from the survey results, dielectric mode failures were the most prominent, \nfollowed by mechanical and electrical type failures, for substation transformers, whereas \ngenerator step-up transformers had higher contributions of thermal and dielectric mode failures. \nAnalysis showed that HV bushings significantly contribute to large failures, which means that \noperators should place large focus on bushing monitoring. Thus, the need for bushing diagnostic \nand monitoring system has risen. \nAt present, the performances of oil paper insulation systems of power transformers under \nswitching and lightning overvoltages can be evaluated by testing in HV laboratory with \nstandard lightning and switching impulse voltage waveforms, in accordance with the IEC \nstandard [3]. In actual conditions, however, the waveforms of transient overvoltages that appear \non the terminals of power transformer can be extremely complex due to the numerous factors \nsuch as the location of surge arresters, the topology of the network, etc. [4-6]. Front and tail \ntime of such overvoltages may be shorter or longer than the standard one defined by IEC \nstandard, and the wave shapes may be very different from the unidirectional double \nexponentials used in laboratory conditions and may even be bidirectional [7]. Results presented \nin [8] indicate that transformer winding’s response to certain oscillatory voltages can be worse \nthan that under any form of aperiodic voltages, whether lightning impulse, chopped lightning \nimpulse or steep front - long tailed switching surge. It was shown that terminal excitation at \nSamir Keitoue, Ivan Murat, Božidar Filipović-Grčić, Alan Župan, Ivana Damjanović, Ivica Pavić, Lightning caused overvoltages on power transformers \nrecorded by on-line transient overvoltage monitoring system, Journal of Energy, vol. 67 Number 2 (2018), Special Issue, p. 44–53\n46\n3\nfrequencies coinciding with any one of the winding’s natural frequencies may lead to large \nvoltage amplification inside a transformer and can cause severe stresses on insulation. For the \nabove described reason, there is a need to study the characteristics of the transient overvoltages \nin the field. Transient overvoltages where suspect to be the reason for a number of insulation \nbreakdowns in the last decades, so their monitoring with true waveform recording is of high \nimportance. Actual measurements can also be used to study the interaction between the power \ntransformer and the grid.\nIn this paper, an on-line TOMS for power transformers and shunt reactors is presented. \nOvervoltages are measured on the outside measurement terminal of bushing. The focus of the \npaper is on the analysis of transient overvoltages caused by lightning strikes recorded at the \nterminals of power transformer with rated power 150 MVA and rated voltages 220/110 kV \nlocated near thermal power plant. To determine the cause of the recorded transient overvoltages, \ndata from TOMS are correlated with data from the LLS and from the SCADA system. Collected \ndata about number, peak and duration of recorded transient overvoltages can be used as the \nbasis for the assessment of the transformer insulation condition and estimation of health index. \nData recorded by TOMS are also of significant importance since the insulation system of power \ntransformer and other equipment in the substation can be damaged by lightning of switching \novervoltages. \n2. ON-LINE TRANSIENT OVERVOLTAGE MONITORING SYSTEM\nOvervoltages in power network can be caused by lightning strikes to overhead transmission \nlines, circuit breaker switching operations and faults. Power transformers can be exposed to \nsuch transient overvoltages during the operation. Transient overvoltages with steep wave front \nhave an impact on dielectric stresses of the insulation of first few winding turns. The number \nand amplitudes of overvoltages which stress the insulation depend on various parameters such \nas the lightning strike density in the considered area, since it determines how often the \ntransformer is stressed by lightning overvoltages. Since the overvoltage amplitudes at \ntransformer terminals are usually unknown, an on-line overvoltage transient recorder is used \nwith the ability to sample, analyze and store transients in real-time. Collected data can be used \nas the basis for the assessment of the transformer insulation condition, especially if combined \nwith other transformer data such as dissolved gas analysis (DGA). This fact was the driving \nforce for upgrading the existing (TMS) transformer monitoring system [9], [10] with TOMS. \nOvervoltages, as well as voltages, are measured on a measuring tap of corresponding bushing. \nThe connection with the measuring tap shown in Fig. 3 (a) is accomplished with a specially \ndesigned adaptor while the link between the adaptor and impedance matching circuit is carried \nout with a coaxial cable. TOMS installed on a 150 MVA power transformer is shown in Fig. 3 \n(b) [11], [12].\nMeasurement of transients needs to be triggered by an external signal. Since only one of \nthe eight input channels of the overvoltage acquisition module can be used as a trigger, the \ntrigger can be set only for one phase at a time. It is necessary to provide an additional signal \nthat is used as a trigger for data acquisition. This signal shall trigger data acquisition if \novervoltage occurs in any of the phases. While overvoltages are acquired occasionally, voltages \nneed to be measured continuously in order to detect changes of bushing capacitance. To \naccomplish this, continuous voltage measurement is performed with an additional analogue \ninput module. The measuring range of the overvoltage acquisition module is ±15 V. In order to \nextend the overvoltage detection range to approx. 5·Û\nfn (where Ûfn equals to the peak value of \nthe nominal phase voltage), it is necessary to dimension the capacitors of the matching circuit \nin a way that for the nominal voltage, the amplitude of the signal entering overvoltage \nacquisition module equals approximately 3 V. At the same time, the module used to \ncontinuously sample voltage signal has a measuring range of ±60 V. In order to optimally utilize \nSamir Keitoue, Ivan Murat, Božidar Filipović-Grčić, Alan Župan, Ivana Damjanović, Ivica Pavić, Lightning caused overvoltages on power transformers \nrecorded by on-line transient overvoltage monitoring system, Journal of Energy, vol. 67 Number 2 (2018), Special Issue, p. 44–53\n47\n4\nboth measuring ranges i.e. vertical resolution of both acquisition modules, signal conditioning \nwas done in two stages as shown in Fig. 4. \n         \n                                (a)                                                                      (b)\nFigure 3. (a) Connection to measurement terminal of bushing; (b) Transient overvoltage \nmonitoring system (Končar TMS+) installed on power transformer\nFigure 4. Scheme of matching circuit\nBesides signal conditioning, the second stage of matching circuit also implements solution \nfor the triggering of overvoltage acquisition. The following was considered during design:\n Capacitance of C3 and C4 needs to be selected to ensure that the potential of the node B \nis approximately 3 V when nominal voltage value Ûfn is applied.\n Capacitance of C3 and C4 must not influence significantly on the potential of the node \nA, i.e. total capacitance of C 3 and C 4 connected into series must be negligible in \ncomparison to the capacitance of C 2 (C2 = C 21 + C 22). The input impedance of the \nvoltage measuring module is 1 MΩ and it does not change the potential of the node A \nmuch.\n Impedance of the condenser C4 must be negligible at the lowest frequency (in this case \nsystem frequency of 50 Hz) to the input impedance of overvoltage module which is 1 \nMΩ.\nThe potential of the node C is used to trigger data acquisition when overvoltages occur. It is \nequal to 0 V as long as all the impedances Z X are equal and the system voltage of all three \nphases balanced. In case of unbalance of three-phase system voltages, like it is the case when \novervoltages occur, the potential of node C will not be equal to 0 V. In this way data acquisition \nSamir Keitoue, Ivan Murat, Božidar Filipović-Grčić, Alan Župan, Ivana Damjanović, Ivica Pavić, Lightning caused overvoltages on power transformers \nrecorded by on-line transient overvoltage monitoring system, Journal of Energy, vol. 67 Number 2 (2018), Special Issue, p. 44–53\n48\n5\nwill also be triggered in case of a voltage disturbance in electrical grid (transients) which not \nnecessarily have the amplitude higher than the nominal voltage. After completion of the design \nof the Končar TMS+ prototype and successful testing in the high voltage laboratory of Končar \nElectrical Engineering Institute, a project was started to install the system on in-service power \ntransformers. TOMS is installed in the substation which is managed by the Croatian \ntransmission system operator. Voltages are measured at 220 kV and 110 kV side of 150 MVA \nautotransformer AT1 with a vector group (Yna0d5). The brief layout of the 110/220 kV \nsubstation which is connected to thermal power plant is shown in Fig. 5.\nFigure 5. Layout of 110/220 kV substation connected to thermal power plant \nThis substation consists of three 150 MVA autotransformers, 7 transmission lines connected to \n110 kV busbars and 1 double-circuit transmission line connected to 220 kV busbars. Generators \nlocated in thermal power plant are connected to 110 kV busbars via 150 MVA power \ntransformer and to 220 kV busbars via 245 MVA power transformer. Surge arresters are \ninstalled in all transformer and transmission line bays (surge arresters with rated voltage U\nr=198 \nkV are installed at 220 kV level and with U r=108 kV at 110 kV level). All transmission lines \nare equipped with a single shield wire. Substation and connected transmission lines are situated \nin the area with relatively high lightning activity. Transmission lines are crossing over the rocky \nterrain with relatively high soil resistivity, some of them passing through mountainous area with \nrelatively high tower grounding resistance. Therefore, flashovers on transmission lines often \noccur due to lightning strikes, leading to short circuit and automatic reclosing of circuit breakers \nlocated in transmission line bays.\n3. LIGHTNING LOCATION SYSTEM\nAt the end of 2008, a LLS was established as part of the LINET network, covering a wide \narea of the Croatian territory. LINET is a modern LLS with a network of more than 125 sensors \ncovering most of Europe. LLS measures the VLF/LF frequency spectrum of electromagnetic \nwaves which lightning strikes emit. The measurement of magnetic flux is carried out through \nSamir Keitoue, Ivan Murat, Božidar Filipović-Grčić, Alan Župan, Ivana Damjanović, Ivica Pavić, Lightning caused overvoltages on power transformers \nrecorded by on-line transient overvoltage monitoring system, Journal of Energy, vol. 67 Number 2 (2018), Special Issue, p. 44–53\n49\n6\nhighly sensitive sensors which are arranged across the area with spacing of around 150 to 250 \nkm. Since the electromagnetic emission of the lightning spreads at the speed of light, it reaches \nthe sensors at different points in time. Although the difference is in the order of micro-seconds, \nthe exact calculation of the original emission location of the lightning strike is possible. The \ndata measured by every single sensor is transmitted to a central server. The exact geographical \nposition for all the lightning strikes measured is calculated and stored in a database. This \nmeasurement method is also known as the “time-of-arrival” method. Application of LLS in \npower system control of Croatian transmission system operator enables lightning activity \ntracking and time-spatial correlation with incidences (faults, automatic re-closures, outages) \nregistered by the relay protection system [12]. \n4. TRANSIENT OVERVOLTAGES RECORDED ON 150 MVA POWER \nTRANSFORMER\nSeveral cases of recorded transient overvoltages are analysed in more detail to determine \nthe possible cause of each event. \n4.1. Case 1 - lightning strike to 220 kV transmission line causing insulator flashover in one \nphase\nTransients recorded by TOMS are shown in Fig 6. The recorded transients were time-\ncorrelated with a lightning strike which was detected by LLS. Lightning strike with current \namplitude -184 kA occurred on the 220 kV transmission line route, at a distance of 62.4 km \nfrom the substation. At the same time, SCADA system detected single phase to ground fault in \nphase B at the 220 kV transmission line, following the single-pole auto-reclosure of circuit \nbreaker in the line bay. Therefore, recorded transient overvoltages were most probably caused \nby lightning strike to transmission line which caused single phase to ground fault.\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28-250\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nt (ms)\nU (kV)\nA (HV) B (HV) C (HV) A (LV) B (LV) C (LV)\n   a)\n2.5 3 3.5 4\nx 10\n-3\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\n150\nt (ms)\nU (kV)\n        b)\nFigure 6.

Case 2 - lightning strike to 110 kV transmission line causing insulator flashover in one \nphase\nAnother event that was recorded by TOMS is shown in Fig 7. Second event (Fig. 7 b) \noccurred 113 ms after the first event (Fig. 7 a), and third event (Fig. 7 c) occurred 174 ms after \nthe second event. Recorded transients were time-correlated with a lightning flash consisting of \nfive subsequent lightning strikes which were detected by LLS. Parameters of multiple lightning \nstrikes are given in Table I. Three lightning strikes marked in Table I were selected as the ones \nthat probably caused recorded transients.\nSamir Keitoue, Ivan Murat, Božidar Filipović-Grčić, Alan Župan, Ivana Damjanović, Ivica Pavić, Lightning caused overvoltages on power transformers \nrecorded by on-line transient overvoltage monitoring system, Journal of Energy, vol. 67 Number 2 (2018), Special Issue, p. 44–53\n50\n7\n0 3 6 9 12 15-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nt (ms)\nU (kV)\nA (HV) B (HV) C (HV) A (LV) B (LV) C (LV)\na)\n0 3 6 9 12 15-250\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nt (ms)\nU (kV)\nA (HV) B (HV) C (HV) A (LV) B (LV) C (LV)\nc)\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nt (ms)\nU (kV)\nA (HV) B (HV) C (HV) A (LV) B (LV) C (LV)\nb)\n2.8 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4 4.2\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\n150\nt (ms)\nU (kV)\nA (HV) B (HV) C (HV) A (LV) B (LV) C (LV)\nd)\nFigure 7.

At the same time, SCADA system detected single phase to ground fault in phase B \nat the 110 kV transmission line, following by the single-pole auto-reclosure of circuit breaker \nin the line bay. Therefore, recorded transient overvoltages were most probably caused by \nmultiple lightning strike in corridor of 110 kV transmission lines, which caused insulator \nflashover of the struck tower and consequently single phase to ground fault i.e. short-line fault \nin the vicinity of substation.\nSamir Keitoue, Ivan Murat, Božidar Filipović-Grčić, Alan Župan, Ivana Damjanović, Ivica Pavić, Lightning caused overvoltages on power transformers \nrecorded by on-line transient overvoltage monitoring system, Journal of Energy, vol. 67 Number 2 (2018), Special Issue, p. 44–53\n51\n8\n4.3.

Lightning strike with current \namplitude -169 kA marked in Table III was selected as the one that probably caused recorded \ntransients.\nSamir Keitoue, Ivan Murat, Božidar Filipović-Grčić, Alan Župan, Ivana Damjanović, Ivica Pavić, Lightning caused overvoltages on power transformers \nrecorded by on-line transient overvoltage monitoring system, Journal of Energy, vol. 67 Number 2 (2018), Special Issue, p. 44–53\n52\n9\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28-400\n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\n200\n300\nt (ms)\nU (kV)\nA (HV) B (HV) C (HV) A (LV) B (LV) C (LV)\n   a)\n2.5157 3.5157 4.5157 5.5157\n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\n200\nt (ms)\nU (kV)\nA (HV) B (HV) C (HV) A (LV) B (LV) C (LV)\n        b)\nFigure 9.

At the same time, SCADA system detected two simultaneous \nsingle phase to ground faults at one circuit of 220 kV transmission line, following by the auto-\nreclosure operation of circuit breaker in the line bay. Therefore, recorded transient overvoltages \nwere most probably caused by lightning strike to 220 kV transmission line, which caused \ninsulator flashover in two phases of the struck tower and consequently simultaneous two single \nphase to ground faults. \n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, an on-line TOMS for power transformers is presented that is capable to \ncontinuously record in real-time various kinds of transient overvoltages such as lightning or \nswitching overvoltages. TOMS was used for recording lightning caused transient overvoltages \nat the terminals of 150 MVA power transformer located in 220/110 kV substation. Recorded \nwaveforms originating from lightning strikes to overhead lines are correlated with data from \nthe LLS and SCADA system. Four events recorded by TOMS were analysed to determine the \npossible cause of transient overvoltages appearing on the power transformer’s terminals. \nResults show excellent time and spatial correlation between data from TOMS, LLS and \nSCADA system. According to the correlation between data from these systems, recorded events \nwere most probably caused by lightning strikes to 110 kV and 220 kV overhead lines. Lightning \nstrikes caused flashovers on the insulator strings of transmission line towers. Relay protections \nsystem successfully detected these faults and auto-reclosure of circuit breaker occurred. \nIn the future work, an analysis will be conducted focusing on the characteristics of recorded \novervoltage waveforms, i.e. frequency and amplitude. Statistical analysis on time parameters \nof transient overvoltages will be performed, based on a large number of recorded events to \nobtain statistical distributions. Collected data about overvoltage stresses can be used as the basis \nfor the assessment of the transformer insulation condition and estimation of health index. \nSamir Keitoue, Ivan Murat, Božidar Filipović-Grčić, Alan Župan, Ivana Damjanović, Ivica Pavić, Lightning caused overvoltages on power transformers \nrecorded by on-line transient overvoltage monitoring system, Journal of Energy, vol. 67 Number 2 (2018), Special Issue, p. 44–53\n53\n10\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work has been supported in part by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project \n“Development of advanced high voltage systems by application of new information and \ncommunication technologies” (DAHVAT). \nREFERENCES\n[1] CIGRÉ WG A2.37, “Transformer Reliability Survey”, technical brochure no. 642, Paris, \n2015.\n[2] S.
