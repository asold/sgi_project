This is most notable in alcoholics with Wernicke-\nKorsakoﬀ’s Syndrome (WKS), the pathogenesis of which lies in\nthiamine (vitamin B1) deﬁciency. Alcoholics are at particul ar\nrisk of developing thiamine depletion as a result of poor\nnutritional intake (both of the vitamin itself and others as sociated\nwith its absorption [e.g., folate, vitamin B12]) and alcohol’ s\ndisruptive eﬀects on metabolism (\nThomson et al., 2012 ).\nWernicke’s Encephalopathy (WE)—that is, the initial acute pha se\nof WKS—is diagnosed on the basis of having two or more\nof the following symptoms: a history of nutritional deﬁcienc y,\noculomotor dysfunction (nystagmus, ophthalmalgia), ataxi a, and\nan altered mental state or memory impairment (\nCaine et al.,\n1997). If recognized early, symptoms of WE can largely be\nrelieved via treatment with parenteral thiamine ( Day et al., 2013 ).\nYet between 56 and 85% of patients with WE will go on to\ndevelop Korsakoﬀ’s Syndrome (KS;\nWood et al., 1986; Cook\net al., 1998 ), a chronic neuropsychiatric condition characterized\nby profound memory dysfunction. While anterograde amnesia\nis pathognomonic of KS, an increasing body of evidence has\nindicated the cognitive deﬁcit is not as circumscribed as on ce\nthought. For example, those with KS frequently display impaired\nperformance on tests of Executive Function (EF) requiring\nplanning, attention shifting, inhibition, and ﬂuency (\nBrokate\net al., 2003; van Oort and Kessels, 2009 ), and these ﬁndings are\nreﬂected in recent diagnostic criteria for the disorder (DS M-5;\nAmerican Psychiatric, 2013 ).\nIt is also evident that there exists a cohort of alcoholics\nwho present with clinically meaningful neurocognitive\nimpairment who do not meet all the criteria for WKS or\nother discrete alcohol-related neurological disorders (e .g.,\nMarchiafava–Bignami disorder). For the more impaired\nwithin this group, a diagnosis of Alcohol-Related Dementia\nAbbreviations: Samples: ALs, Alcohol-dependent persons (no speciﬁc diagnosis\nof cognitive impairment); ALC: Alcohol-dependent persons with a dia gnosis of\nmild alcohol-related cognitive impairment not ﬁtting KS or ARD criteria; ARBD,\nAlcohol-related brain damage; ARCI, Alcohol-related cognitive impairmen t;\nARD, Alcohol-related dementia; KS, Korsakoﬀ’s syndrome; WE, Wernic ke’s\nEncephalopathy. Key neuropsychological tests: BADS, Behavioral A ssessment of\nthe Dysexecutive Syndrome; CVLT, California Verbal Learning Tes t; MMSE,\nMini-Mental Status Examination; MoCA, Montreal Cognitive As sessment; NART,\nNational Adult Reading Test; NVCL-20, Nijmegen-Venray Confab ulation List;\nRMBT, Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test; WAIS, Wechsler Adult Intelli gence\nScale; WMS, Wechsler Memory Scale. Other: CSIs, Cognitive Screeni ng\nInstruments; EF, Executive Function.\n(ARD) has been proposed ( Oslin et al., 1998 ), although this\nhas been met with some contention. ARD is described as a\nglobal decline in cognition with a more insidious onset than\nWKS, but the choice of nomenclature has been criticized as\nthe disorder is not progressive with abstinence—unlike most\ndementias (\nRidley et al., 2013 ). Debate also surrounds the\netiopathogenesis of the disorder, with one line of thinking\nassociating ARD with the direct neurotoxic eﬀects of alcohol,\nincluding neuroinﬂammation and glutamate excitotoxicity\noccurring during withdrawal (see\nRidley et al., 2013 ), and\nanother suggesting ARD is simply a variation of WKS caused\nby thiamine depletion (\nJoyce, 1994 ). While the mechanisms of\nalcohol neurotoxicity are likely implicated in the neurocogn itive\ndecline of alcoholics to an extent ( Sullivan and Zahr, 2008 ),\nevidence from neuropathological, neuroimaging ( Harper, 2009;\nZahr et al., 2011 ) and neuropsychological investigations ( Pitel\net al., 2011 ) is supportive of a central role of thiamine depletion.\nNonetheless, it appears both processes work synergistically to\ngenerate greater damage than either in isolation (\nHe et al., 2007 ).\nMore recently, the term Alcohol-Related Brain Damage\n(ARBD) has been adopted in place of other diagnostic\nnomenclature to describe a spectrum of neurocognitive\nimpairment encompassing both WKS and ARD (\nHayes\net al., 2016 ). This nascent conceptualization may provide\na more pragmatic nosological approach by acknowledging\nthe heterogeneous consequences of chronic alcoholism\nand associated factors (e.g., nutritional deﬁciencies, he patic\ndysfunction, cerebrovascular disorders, head injury). The most\nrecent DSM-5 (\nAmerican Psychiatric, 2013 ) appears more\naligned with this thinking, outlining both mild and severe f orms\nof alcohol-related neurocognitive disorder which are furthe r\ndivided into amnestic (i.e., KS) and non-amnestic types.\nWilson et al. (2012) have proﬀered criteria for ARBD as a\nspeciﬁc diagnostic entity, adapting those provided by Oslin and\nCary (2003) for ARD. They present an operational diagnostic\nchecklist for use by hospital staﬀ in facilitating the quick\nidentiﬁcation of those with or at risk of ARBD, with a focus bot h\non symptomology and the frequent consequences of the disorder\n(e.g., regular hospital admissions).\nWilson (2013) has also\npresented more thorough diagnostic criteria for ARBD as a broad\nspectrum of alcohol-related neurocognitive impairment, thou gh\nneither criteria appear to have been subsequently validated. It\nappears that the authors encompass WKS within their deﬁnition\nof ARBD (based on the inclusion of individuals with WKS in thei r\nsample;\nWilson et al., 2012 ) and thus use the term in a broad sense\nto capture the heterogeneous neurocognitive manifestation s of\nalcohol abuse. However, other authors appear to use the term\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al. Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\nto describe all such manifestations that do not meet criteri a for\nWKS (e.g., Zahr et al., 2011 ), in a similar way to which ARD\nhas historically been employed. Though, as noted by the autho rs\nusing the term in this manner, postulating ARBD as a distinct\ndiagnostic entity from WKS will be subject to the same critic isms\nas the ARD hypothesis; namely that it may represent a variation\nor earlier phase of WKS (\nZahr et al., 2011 ). Given the central role\nof thiamine depletion found in the cognitive decline of osten sibly\n“non-WKS” alcohol abusers ( Pitel et al., 2011 ), this conclusion\nseems justiﬁed.\nRegardless of etiological or nosological debate, the deﬁnin g\ntwo features of alcohol-related neurocognitive disorders are a\nprolonged history of excessive alcohol use and an attributab le\ncognitive deﬁcit. Accordingly, neuropsychological assess ment\nhas been suggested as the most reliable method of diagnosis\n(\nHayes et al., 2016 ) and been promoted for inclusion in the\nroutine assessment of all alcoholics ( Davies et al., 2005 ). While\nimaging methods are also of use in identifying alcohol-relat ed\nbrain changes, indices of neuronal and structural brain cha nge\nderived from such measures provide limited information abou t\nthe functional implications of this damage, which are likely of\ngreater clinical interest. In contrast, neuropsychologica l testing\ncan characterize both the type and extent of cognitive deﬁcit\n(thereby guiding rehabilitation eﬀorts), inform assessmen ts of\ncapacity, and be used to monitor improvements over time (\nHayes\net al., 2016 ).\nMultiple studies have explored the psychometric and practical\nvalue of various neuropsychological tools for the assessmen t\nof Alcohol-Related Cognitive Impairment (ARCI), providing a\nwealth of information regarding the utility of various test s (e.g.,\nWester et al., 2013b; Rensen et al., 2015 ). Systematic reviews\nand meta-analyses of such studies in other populations (e.g.,\ndementia) are common (e.g.,\nTsoi et al., 2015; Carson et al.,\n2018), though there remains a lacuna in the area of ARCI\nassessment. A review was recently published by Horton et al.\n(2015a) which discussed neuropsychological testing and other\nmethods of assessment (psychological, nutritional etc.) us ed with\nthis group. However, the review touched only superﬁcially on\nthe complexities of ARCI assessment, failed to include multi ple\nrelevant studies (e.g.,\nKopelman, 1991; Taylor and Heaton, 2001 ),\nand omitted investigations of ARD and ARBD participants.\nThe absence of a rigorous systematic review complicates\nevidence-based test selection for those involved in ARCI\nassessment, making it a time consuming and complex process\nof comparison across multiple tests and studies. At present, th e\nliterature surrounding test utility is less-established f or ARCI\nthan disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease, warranting a mo re\nbroad and comprehensive review of the existing evidence-bas e\nin order to discuss its current status and guide future resea rch\ndirections. Accordingly, the aims of the systematic review\npresented here were to: [1] identify the neuropsychological t ools\nmost commonly used in the screening, diagnosis, and assessm ent\nof ARCI, and [2] synthesize and discuss all ﬁndings relating to the\ndiagnostic, psychometric and practical merits of these tests within\nthe assessment of this population. We adopted a broad view of\nARCI as a conceptual category of disorders, including KS, ARD,\nand ARBD as a speciﬁc diagnostic entity. While, as suggested\nabove, all cases of ARCI may be variants of the WKS condition,\nwe searched for studies assessing individuals with diagnose s\nof ARD and ARBD based on the use of these distinctions\nwithin the existing literature. It was recognized that ARD an d\nARBD may refer to the same purported condition and that the\nparticular term used could reﬂect the year of publication, as\nopposed to diﬀerences in the symptomology of those diagnosed\nwith ARBD over ARD, or vice versa. The inclusion of studies\nassessing each of these three groups also allowed for further\nevaluation of the validity of these diagnostic distinctions f rom\na neuropsychological perspective. Studies assessing WE were\nomitted due to a greater focus on the assessment of physical\nsymptoms (i.e.,\nCaine et al., 1997 criteria), thiamine blood\nlevels, and neuroimaging outcomes ( Lough, 2012 ) when making\ndiagnostic decisions.\nMETHODS\nA review protocol was developed and registered with PROSPERO\nin December 2015 (Registration No. CRD42015030209) and later\npublished (\nHeirene et al., 2016 ). We provide a brief overview\nof the review methods here (including any deviations from\nour protocol), though recommend referring to our protocol\nfor further details. In developing the protocol and conductin g\nthe review we consulted the PRISMA-P (\nMoher et al., 2015;\nShamseer et al., 2015 ) and PRISMA guidelines ( Liberati et al.,\n2009) and additional guidance on conducting systematic reviews\nin neuropsychology ( Gates and March, 2016 ) and narrative\nsynthesis ( Popay et al., 2006; Centre for Reviews Dissemination,\n2009).\nData Sources and Study Selection\nWe searched for studies using standardized, normatively\ndeﬁned neuropsychological tools in the screening, diagnosis\nor assessment of KS, ARD, and ARBD. Studies assessing\nalcohol-dependent persons without one of the above ARCI\ndiagnoses were omitted as the focus of the review was on\nthe ability of neuropsychological tests to identify and asse ss\nthose with clinically signiﬁcant cognitive impairment (i.e .,\nmeeting diagnostic criteria) and to diﬀerentiate these indi viduals\nfrom those with little or no impairment. We made two\ndeviations from the initial aim of including only standardi zed,\nnormatively deﬁned neuropsychological tests. The ﬁrst to\ninclude studies employing standardized observational meas ures\nof confabulation which are not normatively deﬁned, enabling\na more comprehensive review of ARCI assessment tools. The\nsecond to include a study evaluating the utility of the Brown -\nPeterson paradigm (a non-standardized test with normative d ata\navailable) to allow a more detailed discussion of working me mory\nassessment. We also deviated from our protocol by using the ter m\nARCI over ARBD to frame this review as the former is more\nwidely used outside of the UK.\nThe following databases were searched on January 19th 2016\nand again in August 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psych-INFO,\nProQuest Psychology, and Science Direct. To achieve both ai ms\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al. Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\nof the review the process of study selection and subsequent da ta\nextraction was divided into two consecutive phases. In the ﬁr st\nphase, we identiﬁed 105 studies meeting our original eligibi lity\ncriteria (i.e., standardized test used to assess ARCI). Fro m these,\nwe extracted only the type of ARCI sample assessed and the tool\nused, addressing aim 1 (i.e., identify the tools used). In pha se\ntwo, 43 studies were identiﬁed from within this selection wh ich\nprovided some evaluation of the psychometric, diagnostic or\npractical merits of the tools used. These studies were extrac ted\nin full using a table designed by the authors and presented in o ur\nprotocol (\nHeirene et al., 2016 ). Extracted data from phase two\nwas used to produce a narrative synthesis of ﬁndings focused o n\naddressing aim 2 (i.e., evaluation of the measures) (see Figure 1\nfor an overview of the study selection process).\nTitle and abstract and full-text screening were conducted\nindependently by two authors (RH & GR-D) via Covidence\nonline systematic review software. A pilot full-text screen o f\n20 texts was conducted to check inter-reviewer consistency . A\nKappa statistic of .839 ( P <.001) was achieved from this process,\nindicating excellent consistency between reviewers (\nViera and\nGarrett, 2005 ). Phase two of extraction and study appraisal was\nalso completed independently by two authors (RH & BJ), though\nphase one extraction was carried out by one author (RH).\nQuality Assessment\nAll studies extracted in full were appraised using the quality\nassessment checklist designed by the authors and presented\nin our protocol (\nHeirene et al., 2016 ). We made minor\nupdates to this checklist to provide a less ambiguous\nand more comprehensive assessment of study rigor (see\nSupplemental Document 1 ). We discuss the outcomes of the\nstudy appraisal at the end of the ﬁndings section, though we als o\npresent multiple indices of study quality in the tables of ﬁndi ngs\n(e.g., ensuring a suﬃcient period of abstinence achieved prio r to\ntesting) and highlight any notable methodological weaknes ses\nor strengths of studies when discussing their contribution to the\nreview.\nSynthesis of Findings\nAs anticipated in our protocol, meta-analysis was not appropriat e\nfor the synthesis of ﬁndings due to heterogeneity in the test s\nused, the samples of focus, comparator groups, and the outcomes\nreported. Instead, ﬁndings are synthesized in the form of a\nnarrative review, with tables used throughout to present key\noutcomes. Findings are divided into ﬁve sections covering\ncognitive screening instruments, memory, EF, intelligenc e and\ntest batteries, and premorbid intelligence. Where relevant\nand possible, eﬀect sizes were calculated for between-group\ncomparisons (e.g., ARCI vs. controls) to supplement review\nﬁndings (\nSullivan and Feinn, 2012 ). Cohen’s d was selected as\na commonly used eﬀect size which calculates the standardized\ndiﬀerence in means between groups and can facilitate the relati ve\ncomparisons of each test’s sensitivity (\nLarner, 2014 ). Based on\nCohen’s (1992)original suggestion, eﬀects are classiﬁed as small\n(d = 0.2), medium ( d = 0.5), or large ( d ≥ 0.8). However, these\ncut-oﬀ points are somewhat arbitrary. All eﬀect sizes should b e\nconsidered in conjunction with the methodological quality o f the\nstudy (e.g., sample size, abstinent participants) before reach ing\nconclusions regarding the size of the eﬀect or the implication s of\nthis for the test used. Sensitivity and speciﬁcity values for tests\nwere also calculated where relevant; though few studies prov ided\nthe requisite information (all reviewer calculated outcom es are\npresented inside squared brackets [] in tables).\nFINDINGS\nStudy Characteristics\nThe 105 studies included in phase one of data extraction\nranged in year of publication from 1968 to 2017. Ninety studie s\nassessed KS participants, 15 ARD, six ARBD, and four included\nsamples described as having mild alcohol-related impairment n ot\nﬁtting KS or ARD criteria (ALC), one of which was diagnosed\naccording to the DSM-5’s alcohol-related Mild Neurocognitiv e\nDisorder. The most commonly used tests are presented in\nTable 1 according to each domain of cognitive assessment\ndiscussed in the narrative synthesis (for a complete list of a ll\nneuropsychological tests used within the reviewed studies s ee\nSupplemental Document 2 ).\nThe ﬁnal 43 studies included in phase two of data extraction\nspanned a range of 40-years from 1977 to 2017. Consonant with\nthe studies included in the ﬁrst phase of extraction, the majo rity\nfocused on KS participants ( n = 39), with few investigating\nARD ( n = 4), ALC ( n = 4) or those with a diagnosis of\nARBD ( n = 2). Adding to the confusion surrounding the\nuse of ARBD as a speciﬁc diagnosis that was highlighted in\nthe introduction, neither of the two studies which assessed\nparticipants with this diagnosis (i.e.,\nWelch et al., 1997; Horton\net al., 2015b ) presented criteria for the condition or clearly\ndescribed the deﬁnition of ARBD which they adopted. However,\nit appears that\nWelch et al. (1997) used the term to refer\nto milder neurocognitive impairment not meeting criteria fo r\nWKS, while Horton et al. (2015b) used the term more broadly;\nthough it is unclear whether this included individuals with WKS\ndiagnoses.\nMost studies employed a between groups design ( n = 36),\nthough four assessed only a single group, two assessed multiple\nclinical groups individually, and one was a case-study. Vario us\noutcomes of relevance to the review were reported, with\nthe most common relating to the diagnostic value of tests,\nincluding sensitivity and speciﬁcity values ( n = 23); the\nuse of tests for discriminating between groups ( n = 13);\npositive and negative predictive values ( n = 1); and likelihood\nratios ( n = 1). Twelve studies commented on the practical\nvalues of tests, including ease or time of administration\nor the availability of parallel versions. Outcomes relating\nto validity were common, including convergent ( n = 11),\nconstruct ( n = 11), predictive ( n = 2), concurrent ( n = 1),\nand content validity ( n = 1); while only four studies\nreported reliability values (inter-rater = 2; test-retest = 1;\ninternal = 1).\nCognitive Screening Instruments\nFive reviewed studies evaluated Cognitive Screening Instru ments\n(CSIs) in those with ARCI ( Table 2 presents a summary of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al. Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\nFIGURE 1 | Study selection process: PRISMA Flow-Chart.\ntest and study details along with key outcomes). The Montreal\nCognitive Assessment (MoCA;\nNasreddine et al., 2005 ) was\nassessed by two studies and has received the comparatively\ngreatest psychometric evaluation. In\nWester et al. (2013c) , the\nMoCA eﬀectively diﬀerentiated between KS and ALC groups,\nbetween KS and controls, and between ALC and controls,\nmostly all with good to excellent sensitivity and speciﬁcity levels\nprovided the cut-oﬀ score was adjusted accordingly. Only the KS\nvs. ALC MoCA comparison did not reach optimal 80% sensitivity\nand 60% speciﬁcity criteria cited by the authors (\nBlake et al.,\n2002).\nFurther support for the MoCA has come from Oudman et al.\n(2014), who directly compared the psychometric properties of\nthe MoCA and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE;\nFolstein et al., 1975 ) in a KS and control sample. Overall,\nboth the MoCA and MMSE demonstrated good to excellent\nsensitivity and speciﬁcity, with the MoCA the superior of\nthe two. Reviewer calculated eﬀect sizes support this ﬁnding,\nindicating that the MoCA produced substantially larger relat ive\ndiﬀerences when comparing controls and KS than the MMSE.\nAdditionally, a MoCA cut-oﬀ score of <23 produced nearly\nperfect positive and negative predictive values and likelihood\nratios in\nOudman et al. (2014) . However, while these values\nsupport the screening capabilities of the tool, they should be\ninterpreted with caution as the equal proportion of KS to\ncontrols investigated by Oudman and colleagues is unreﬂect ive\nof typical clinical environments, and thus the values would\nlikely decrease in such settings. As in\nWester et al. (2013c) ,\nadjustments to the cut-oﬀ score of both CSIs were required\nby Oudman et al. to result in the best possible discriminatory\nabilities. Poor sensitivity of the MMSE to KS warranted a rise\nin the standard cut-oﬀ score of <24 to between 25 and 27 to\nproduce optimal sensitivity and speciﬁcity levels, with <26/27\nbeing most able to discriminate between KS and controls (\nWester\net al., 2013c ). For the MoCA, the combined ﬁndings of Oudman\net al. and Wester et al. suggest a cut-oﬀ score of ≤ 23 is needed\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al.

Nonetheless,\ncaution should be exercised when reducing or increasing cut -\noﬀ scores to be conscious of increased false negatives and fa lse\npositives, respectively.\nAlthough Oudman et al.’s (2014) ﬁndings suggest the MMSE\nmay have value in screening for ARCI, the test’s utility is\nrestricted by the absence of items speciﬁcally indexing exec utive\nabilities. Additionally, the memory component of the MMSE\nhas been criticized for its simplicity and lack of sensitivit y to\nalcohol-related memory disorders (\nSquire and Shimamura, 1986;\nKopelman et al., 2009 ). The cognitive assessment component\nof the CAMDEX ( Roth et al., 1986 ), the CAMCOG, includes\nall items from the MMSE in addition to more diﬃcult tests of\nmemory and measures of EF, and thus may be more suitable for\nARCI screening. However,\nDeary et al. (1991) found several of the\nCAMCOG subtests (7 of 11) correlated strongly with the Digit\nSymbol Substitution test of visuospatial processing, which t hey\nstated indicates high redundancy within much of the CAMCOG.\nStill, research evaluating the CAMCOG in this population is\nscant–and nonexistent for the updated CAMCOG-R (\nRoth et al.,\n1999).\nMemory\nIn total, 22 studies evaluated tests of memory, which are fur ther\ndivided into tests of episodic, autobiographical, procedural , and\nworking memory and confabulation.\nEpisodic Memory\nSeventeen studies evaluated neuropsychological tools desi gned\nto assess episodic memory function (see Table 3). Two tests\nfrequently employed were the Rivermead Behavioral Memory\nTest (RBMT;\nWilson et al., 1989 ) and the California Verbal\nLearning Test (CVLT; Delis et al., 1987 ). The RBMT was designed\nas an ecologically focused memory test, oﬀering clinically a nd\npractically useful information about a person’s memory deﬁci t.\nThe RBMT includes various tasks one might encounter in regular\nlife, such as having to remember an appointment or pass on a\nmessage; though, to date, no studies have assessed the RBMT’s\nability to predict day-to-day memory function in those with\nARCI.\nIn\nDuﬀy and O’Carroll (1994) , no signiﬁcant diﬀerence\nbetween KS and schizophrenic groups was observed on the\nBenton Visual Retention Test and Paired-Associated Learnin g\nTest, but the RBMT revealed a memory deﬁcit “orders of\nmagnitude” greater than the other measures, suggesting it\nis particularly sensitive to alcohol-related memory deﬁcit s\ncompared with other commonly employed tests. The RBMT can\nalso discriminate well between KS and ALs, but not between KS\nand ALC groups (\nWester et al., 2014 ). However, the updated\nRBMT-3 appears more sensitive to less-severe memory deﬁcits\nthan the original and was able to signiﬁcantly discriminate\nbetween an ALC and healthy control group in\nWester et al.\n(2013b). Eﬀect sizes indicate the most discriminating subtests\nappear to be those involving delayed testing and prospective\nmemory (e.g., Messages subtest) and orientation. Compared\nwith the original, the RBMT-3 has also been found to produce\nconsiderably less ceiling and ﬂoor eﬀects in ARCI and control\ngroups and classiﬁes less healthy participants as impaired (\nWester\net al., 2013a). A potential shortcoming of the RBMT-3 is its failure\nto assess working memory and semantic memory, both of which\nare impaired in those with ARCI (\nPitel et al., 2008; Rensen et al.,\n2016).\nThe CVLT has shown sensitivity to KS-related memory\ndeﬁcits across several of its variables, diﬀerentiating bet ween\nthose with KS, ALC, and AL groups ( Brokate et al., 2003; Wester\net al., 2014 ). Eﬀect sizes suggest the variables most able to\ndiscriminate between these groups are the 5th learning trial of\nimmediate testing and short and delayed free-recall. An upda ted\nversion of the CVLT (CVLT-II; Delis et al., 2000 ) is available,\nthough none of the studies in the review used the CVLT-II, with\nno rationale provided for this decision. As a result, research is\nneeded to validate the CVLT-II in this population.\nThe Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS;\nWechsler, 1945 ) in\nvarying editions was evaluated by six studies within the rev iew.\nExploring score proﬁles of brain-damaged populations and\ncontrols on the WMS and its counterpart, the Wechsler Adult\nIntelligence Scale (WAIS),\nAlekoumbides et al.

Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\nthat particularly depressed scores on the Logical Memory (LM),\nVisual Reproduction (VR), and Associate Learning (AL) variabl es\nof the WMS—relative to mostly preserved remaining WMS and\nWAIS scores—should be observed to conﬁrm KS. The Logical\nMemory subtest and its variables have also shown an ability to\ndiscriminate between KS and depression, although not betwee n\nKS and Alzheimer’s (\nKopelman, 1986 ). However, based on the\nresults of multiple memory assessments, Kopelman found tests\nof immediate recall of small quantities of verbal informati on (e.g.,\nDigit Span and immediate recall of an 8-word name and address)\ncould eﬀectively discriminate between the memory deﬁcits of KS\nand Alzheimer’s Disease, with the latter performing signiﬁc antly\nworse.\nTwo response biases to WMS subtests have been identiﬁed\nin ARCI participants. First, after observing visual confabul ations\nresembling a wineglass on the Visual Reproduction subtest of\nthe WMS-R in ALs,\nWelch et al. (1997) searched for the same\nreproductions in ALs and those with ARCI. However, only\nsix of 30 mixed ARCI participants produced the “wineglass\nconfabulation, ” suggesting its value in detecting ARCI is l imited.\nSecond, in\nHoldnack and Delis (2004) KS participants displayed a\nparticularly strong negative response bias (i.e., frequentl y saying\n“no”) on the Face recognition test of the WMS-III ( Wechsler,\n1997), which diﬀerentiated them from those with Alzheimer’s\nDisease and Huntington’s Disease. KS performance on the test\nwas poor overall, recognizing fewer faces than controls and t he\nother clinical groups. The face recognition test has, howeve r, been\nremoved from the most recent edition of the WMS (IV), though\nﬁndings are still of interest to other measures using tests o f face\nrecognition (e.g., RBMT-3).\nTwo tests which have demonstrated preliminary evidence of\nan ability to distinguish between the episodic memory deﬁcit s of\nthose with ARCI and ALs are the Doors and People Test (DPT;\nBaddeley et al., 1994 ) and Free and Cued Selective Reminding\nTest (FCSRT; Buschke, 1984; Grober and Buschke, 1987 ). Using\nthe cut-oﬀ point set by Maharasingam et al. (2013) of 1.5 SD\nbelow the norm mean, the DPT test correctly identiﬁed all KS\nas impaired, although also classed multiple ALs (10 of 16) as\nimpaired. However, poor speciﬁcity at this cut-oﬀ should not be\nviewed as a criticism of the measure, but rather highlights i ts\nsensitivity to all alcohol-related memory deﬁcits and sugg ests a\nfurther reduction in the cut-oﬀ point is required to diﬀerenti ate\nthese groups. In relation to the FCSRT,\nPitel et al. (2008) have\nrecommended the test may be useful in diﬀerentiating between\nKS and ALs based on ﬁnding entirely dichotomized score range s\nbetween these groups. The FCSRT also produced a substantially\nlarge eﬀect size between KS and AL groups ( d = 3.54) and—by\nsome considerable margin—the largest between KS and contro ls\nof any test reviewed (5.93).\nFinally, one study evaluated the utility of the Three Words –\nThree Shapes (3W3S) bedside memory screening tool in those\nwith KS. In its validation,\nWeintraub et al. (2000) found the\n3W3S clearly diﬀerentiated the impairment of KS from controls ,\nbut not between KS and early Alzheimer’s disease on any of its\nvariables; though, a decline in memory function over repeate d\ntesting in an Alzheimer’s case was reported, illustrating pote ntial\nfor diﬀerential diagnosis between groups. However, since its\nvalidation the 3W3S has received little further evaluation and\navailable normative data is limited (cf.\nKudiaki and Aslan,\n2007).\nAutobiographical Memory\nAutobiographical memory is a form of declarative memory\nfor personal experiences (episodic) and facts (semantic) abou t\noneself (e.g., name, occupation). Only one study was identiﬁ ed\nwhich evaluated tests of autobiographical memory (\nRensen\net al., 2016 ; see Table 4). Rensen and colleagues compared\nthe eﬃcacy of the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI;\nKopelman et al., 1989 ) and Autobiographical Interview (AI;\nLevine et al., 2002 ) in a KS and control group. The AI\nonly asks for one memory from each recalled time-period\n(compared with three for the AMI), which\nRensen et al.\n(2016) hypothesized may make it less likely to display a\ntemporal memory gradient if there exists a particularly salien t\nmemory which has been repeatedly retrieved throughout a\nperson’s lifetime and is therefore abnormally well-preserved .\nHowever, both measures revealed a temporal gradient in\nmemory function—a known feature of KS amnesia (\nKopelman,\n1989).\nAlthough both assessments produced signiﬁcant diﬀerences\nbetween the groups in relation to preserved episodic and\nsemantic memory over various time-periods, a substantially\nlarger eﬀect size was observed for diﬀerences in semantic\nmemory on the AMI compared with the corresponding AI\nvariable (\nRensen et al., 2016 ). The authors suggested this could\nbe as the AI does not request speciﬁc semantic information\nlike the AMI, but scores the semantic details incorporated int o\nepisodic memories. The AMI demonstrated superior inter-rater\nreliability, with scores in the excellent range for both the E pisodic\nincident and Semantic personal schedules. In contrast, inte r-rater\nreliability for the AI Semantic details score was in the good range,\nwhile the Internal (episodic) details was in the moderate ran ge.\nRensen and colleagues speculated that the complexity of the AI\nscoring system, even for trained raters, compared with the AMI\nmay explain these diﬀerences.\nProcedural Memory\nFour of the included studies evaluated tools used in the\nassessment of procedural memory (see Table 5).\nButters et al.\n(1985) used the Tower of Hanoi (ToH) task to assess\ncognitive procedural learning in KS, which they hypothesized\nwould be preserved based on previous research showing\nnormal performance on mirror-reading and pursuit-rotor task s\nof procedural memory. Contrary to their expectations, KS\nparticipants showed signiﬁcantly less learning on the ToH tes t\nover 2 days compared with controls, suggesting they were slow er\nto acquire the necessary skills to complete the task. Butters and\ncolleagues implicated the problem-solving element of the ToH a s\nthe cause of the KS group’s poor performance—as opposed to a\nprocedural memory deﬁcit—and suggested the test is limited i n\nproducing an understanding of procedural learning, given tha t\nperformance is also dependent on the identiﬁcation, sequenci ng,\nand retention of moves.

(1998) argued that the 16\ntrials used in Butters et al. (1985) allowed control participants\nto increase their reliance on declarative memory over time,\nverbalizing the correct strategy for completing the task.\nAccordingly, they reduced the number of ToH trials per sessio n\nto three, decreasing the chance of verbalization in control\nparticipants and included a pilot trial using only three (inste ad\nof four) discs, allowing participants access to the underlyin g\nproblem-solving strategy required. Under these conditions, the\nKS participant did not diﬀer from controls in the time-to-solve\nor the number of moves on the four-disk version, indicating\npreserved cognitive procedural learning. Still, it remains po ssible\nthat this procedure was simply too easy to reveal any deﬁcit.\nIn those with Parkinson’s Disease, impairments are not evide nt\non easier tasks of procedural learning, but become apparent\nwhen the diﬃculty is increased (\nHaaland et al., 1997 ). This same\nhypothesis was posited by Munro et al. (2001) as an explanation\nfor the normal performance by participants with ARD on the\nPursuit Rotor Learning Task.\nMore recently, the RMBT-3’s newly-added Novel Task subtest\nhas been investigated as a measure of procedural learning.\nWester\net al. (2013a) suggested the test may rely on procedural memory\nfor correct completion, and performance appears to be impaired\nin both KS and ALC groups compared to controls. Although, in a\nseparate study, the same authors stated completion of the Nove l\nTask may involve spatial working memory during the immediate\ntrial and visuospatial episodic recall in delayed testing (\nWester\net al., 2013b ), potentially explaining the poor performance on the\ntest by those with ARCI.\nWorking Memory\nTwo studies evaluated tests speciﬁcally designed for workin g\nmemory assessment (see Table 6). The Brown-Peterson (BP)\nTask (\nBrown, 1958; Peterson and Peterson, 1959 ) was employed\nby Leng and Parkin (1989) as a measure of working memory\nin those with KS, although their ﬁndings questioned the\nconstruct validity of the test. KS participants performed wors e\nwith each consecutive increase in delay length (up to 60 s).\nHowever, BP performance in the KS group was not signiﬁcantly\ncorrelated with performance on any of several memory tests bu t\nwas correlated with Wisconsin Card Sorting Test performance\non long-delay trials.

Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\nperformance on longer BP trials may be aﬀected not just by\nmemory function, but also manifestations of frontal lobe da mage\nsuch as perseveration—now a known feature of KS (\nDelis et al.,\n1991).\nReviewed studies suggest the Wechsler Digit Span tests and\nsimilar assessments of immediate verbal and visual recall ( e.g.,\nCorsi-Block Tapping Test; Kessels et al., 2000 ) are limited\nin evaluating working memory of those with ARCI, whose\nperformance is similar to controls despite clear deﬁcits on ot her\ntasks (\nHarbinson, 1984; Alekoumbides et al., 1987; Leng and\nParkin, 1989 ). To assess working memory in KS, a slight delay\n(∼ 8 s) may be required to activate the maintenance component\nof working memory ( Piekema et al., 2007 ).\nConfabulation\nTwo studies evaluated tests of confabulation in those with\nARCI (see Table 7).\nRensen et al. (2015) devised the Nijmegen-\nVenray Confabulation List (NVCL-20) as an observational\nscale used to quantify confabulatory behavior and validate d\nit in KS and ALC groups. Compared with the Dalla Barba\nConfabulation Battery (DBCB;\nDalla Barba, 1993 ) and the\nProvoked Confabulation Test (PCT; Cooper et al., 2006 ), the\nscale demonstrated superior discriminatory ability betwee n the\ntwo samples and good to excellent internal reliability. Good to\nexcellent inter-rater reliability was also found between pr imary\nand secondary caregivers (excluding the Provoked Confabul ation\ncategory scores for the KS group, which scored moderately),\nthough the participants were divided according to their diagn oses\nas presumed confabulators (KS) and non-confabulators (ALC)\nand raters were not blind to diagnosis, potentially confound ing\nbetween-rater results.\nThe NVCL-20 total score, unlike the DBCB and PCT,\ncorrelated signiﬁcantly with RMBT-3 and CVLT scores in KS\n(\nRensen et al., 2015 ). Thus, those who performed poorly on\nmemory tests tended to score higher on the NVCL-20 (indicati ng\ngreater confabulation). Conversely, no signiﬁcant correl ation\nwas found between the NVCL-20 and the CVLT intrusions\nvariable, questioning the previous use of this as an index of\nconfabulation (e.g.,\nSchnider et al., 1996 ). Rensen et al.’s (2017)\nﬁndings corroborate this concern, ﬁnding no correlation be tween\nspontaneous and provoked confabulation as measured by the\nNVCL-20 and the total number of intrusions on the CLVT.\nHowever, small but non-signiﬁcant correlations were found\nbetween unrelated intrusions and both forms of confabulati on\n(r = 0.20 for both analyses), suggesting intrusions unrelated\nto the information learnt may be more closely associated wit h\nconfabulations than those related.\nExecutive Function\nSix studies evaluated tests of EF, all in KS participants (see\nTable 8).\nTwo studies found evidence for the sensitivity of the\necologically-based Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecu tive\nSyndrome (BADS;\nWilson et al., 1996 ) to KS-related\nimpairments. When comparing KS and ALs, the Six Elements\nand Rule Shift sub-tests have produced particularly large eﬀect\nsizes ( η ²), approaching those observed on memory testing\n(Doors & People;\nMaharasingam et al., 2013 ). Indeed, when\nconverted to Cohen’sd for comparison with the other eﬀect sizes\ncalculated here, the Six Elements eﬀect size (KS vs. AL) was th e\nlargest of any observed in the review ( d = 6.0; Maharasingam\net al., 2013 ). When employing the BADS it is important to\nobserve individual sub-test scores as only 40% of KS were clas sed\nas impaired on the overall age-corrected score in van Oort and\nKessels (2009), although this ﬁgure rose to 87% in Maharasingam\net al. (2013) .\nThe Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; Heaton et al., 1993 )\nappears highly sensitive to KS-related EF deﬁcits ( Shoqeirat et al.,\n1990). A shortened and simpliﬁed version of the WCST, the\nModiﬁed Card Sorting Test (MCST; Nelson, 1976 ), also appears\nsensitive, although to a lesser extent. Comparing KS performa nce\non both the full WCST and Nelson’s version, Shoqeirat et al.\n(1990) found the WCST to be more sensitive to severe executive\ndysfunction and therefore better able to discriminate betw een KS\nand other amnesic groups. The authors stated that this cannot\nsimply because the full WCST is harder (suggesting diﬀerences\nin test procedures are responsible) and advocate investing th e\nadditional time required to employ the full version over the\nMCST. A third rule derivation test which has been used to asses s\nARCI is the Brixton Spatial Anticipation Test (BSPAT). In a\nrelatively large sample of KS ( n = 41) participants,\nVan Den Berg\net al. (2009) found the BSPAT demonstrated good sensitivity and\nspeciﬁcity when discriminating between KS and controls. The\nmeasure may be particularly sensitive to the executive deﬁcit s\nassociated with ARCI as the KS group performed signiﬁcantly\nworse than multiple other cognitively impaired groups.\nTests of cognitive estimations are also impaired in those with\nKS (\nShoqeirat et al., 1990; Kopelman, 1991 ), although whether\nthis reﬂects executive dysfunction remains uncertain. Impa ired\nCognitive Estimation Test (CET) performance in those with\nKS may also result from semantic memory impairments and a\nfailure to “error check” the estimation (\nTaylor and O’Carroll,\n1995). Moreover, despite impairments on the CET, the cognitive\nestimation component of the BADS (i.e., Temporal Judgement)\nappears the least sensitive subtest to KS (\nVan Den Berg et al.,\n2009; Maharasingam et al., 2013 ); though, this may be due to the\nuse of only four questions, compared with 10-15 in the CET.\nTwo reviewed studies examined the inter-correlations of te sts\nof single EFs in those with ARCI in attempts to see where scores\nconverged or diverged. The CET does not appear to correlate\nwith the WCST, MCST, or FAS verbal ﬂuency test (\nShoqeirat et al.,\n1990; Kopelman, 1991 ), and moderate correlations have been\nobserved between the MCST and FAS ( Kopelman, 1991 ), but\nnot consistently and not between the WCST and FAS ( Shoqeirat\net al., 1990 ). The absence of correlations likely reﬂects the distinct\nexecutive skills used to complete these diverse tasks.\nIntelligence and Test Batteries\nIn total, ten of the studies investigated intelligence or ba ttery\ntests (see Table 9). The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS;\nWechsler, 1958 ) was investigated in its varying editions by\nnine studies, often in conjunction with its counterpart, the\nWMS.

Though,\nTaylor and Heaton (2001) found 47% of the normative sample\nscored within the impaired range on at least one factor score\n(e.g., Working Memory, Verbal Comprehension etc.) from the\ncombined Wechsler battery and 14% were impaired on at\nleast two, indicating poor speciﬁcity. This highlights the ne ed\nto identify a disease-speciﬁc proﬁle for ARCI using this test\ncombination. Historically, this has come in the form of a\nsubstantially impaired WMS score compared with WAIS Full-\nScale IQ (FSIQ) for KS. The discrepancy between these scores\nhas been found to be greater for KS than ALs, those with\nvarious neuropsychiatric disorders, and controls (\nOscar-Berman\net al., 1993; Taylor and Heaton, 2001 ). However, impaired\nFSIQ in those with ARCI has also been found, primarily\ndue to poor performance on tests within the Performance\nIQ (PIQ) component (\nTaylor and Heaton, 2001 ). As a result,\nthe discrepancy between the relatively preserved Verbal IQ\n(VIQ) component of the WAIS and the MQ may be a more\neﬀective indicator of KS (\nAlekoumbides et al., 1987; Charter and\nAlekoumbides, 1988 ). However, caution should be exercised in\nusing these discrepancies for the diagnosis of ARCI for reason s\noutlined in the discussion.\nThe speciﬁc WAIS tests on which KS have demonstrated\nimpaired performance include the Digit Symbol Substitution\nTest (DSST), Block Design, Picture Completion and Object\nAssembly (\nMalerstein and Belden, 1968; Glosser et al., 1977;\nHarbinson, 1984; Oscar-Berman et al., 2004 ). Of these, the\nDSST and its replacements have shown the greatest sensitivity\nto ARCI (\nGlosser et al., 1977; Harbinson, 1984 ) and have\nconsistently diﬀerentiated KS from ALs, who are (to a lesser\nextent) also impaired on the test (\nOscar-Berman et al., 2004 ).\nDSST performance appears to depend on a combination of\nnew learning (\nKapur and Butters, 1977 ), psychomotor speed,\nand visuospatial processing ( Glosser et al., 1977 ), explaining its\nsensitivity to ARCI.\nThe CANTAB computerized battery assessment was\ninvestigated by one of the included studies. Horton et al. (2015b)\nfound those with ARBD were impaired relative to norm scores on\nvarious CANTAB tests, particularly the Rapid Visual Processi ng\n(RVP) test of sustained visual attention; though the author s\nsuggest this may reﬂect a processing speed deﬁcit rather than\none of attention. Floor eﬀects were also observed on the RVP ,\nsuggesting this test may be limited in assessing the spectrum of\nability in those with ARCI. However, the application of Horton\nand colleagues’ ﬁndings is restricted as they failed to clear ly\noutline the deﬁnition of ARBD they adopted and the criteria by\nwhich this diagnosis was made. They also omitted whether thei r\nsample comprised individuals with diﬀering diagnostic labels\n(e.g., WE, KS, ARD, and/or ALC), as has been reported by other\nstudies of participants with “ARBD” (e.g.,\nWilson et al., 2012 ).\nPremorbid Ability\nThree studies investigated methods of estimating premorbid\nability (all attempted to predict IQ) in those with ARCI\n(see Table 10), providing some insight into the value of the\nthree approaches typically used: [1] predictions based on\ndemographics (e.g., education, gender, ethnicity), [2] cur rent\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 23 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al.

Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\nperformance on tasks believed to be relatively impervious to\nneurological damage, and [3] a combination of these factors .\nDemographically based predictions may be useful when assessi ng\nindividuals with ARCI as no testing is required and thus\nestimates are not inﬂuenced by participant eﬀort or the eﬀects of\nalcoholism and associated factors (e.g., head injuries).\nO’Carroll\net al. (1992) found demographically based estimates strongly\ncorrelated with those derived by the National Adult Reading T est\n(NART) of premorbid IQ. However, Bright et al. (2002) found\nNART and NART-R based estimates accounted for substantially\nmore of the variance in current WAIS FSIQ than demographic\nvariables, suggesting the NART may be the more accurate\npredictor.\nCrawford et al. (1988) have recommended the use of the\nNART in those with ARD after ﬁnding little diﬀerence between\nARD NART scores and those of demographically matched (age,\ngender, education) controls. The authors also, however, su ggested\nthe NART may be unsuitable for use with KS as it produced\na signiﬁcantly lower IQ than was estimated for a matched\ncontrol group. Nonetheless,\nCrawford et al. (1988) advocated\nthe NART for use with KS over the WAIS Vocabulary test,\nwhich produced lower estimates again.\nO’Carroll et al. (1992)\nhave also questioned the validity of using the NART with KS\nbased on ﬁnding its estimates were signiﬁcantly below those of\ndemographically-derived predictions. Drawing on their ﬁndi ngs\nand those of Crawford and colleagues,\nO’Carroll et al. (1992)\nspeculated the impaired NART performance in KS may result\nfrom executive dysfunction, suggesting that individuals wi th\nKS will quickly read aloud the words according to standard\nphonetical rules of pronunciation, without the necessary err or\nchecking process required for irregular word pronunciation.\nHowever, the processes underlying impaired NART performance\nin KS are yet to be fully elucidated, and those with frontal le sions\nappear to perform comparably with matched controls (\nBright\net al., 2002; MacPherson et al., 2017 ), questioning the role of\nexecutive dysfunction.\nIn contrast to both Crawford et al. (1988) and O’Carroll\net al. (1992) , Bright et al. (2002) found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence\nbetween a larger sample of KS participants and matched controls\non both the NART and NART-R. Moreover, the NART-R\nproduced a smaller discrepancy between its scores and those\nderived from demographic variables than the original NART,\nindicating an improvement in predictive accuracy. Finally, B right\net al. found no additional beneﬁt of combining NART scores wi th\ndemographic variables to better estimate premorbid function\nin KS, other various neuropsychiatric disorders or controls .\nHowever, some value in combining these approaches has been\ndocumented in the wider literature (e.g.,\nVanderploeg and\nSchinka, 1995).\nAssessment of Study Quality\nThe summarized results of the study quality appraisal are\npresented in Table 11 (see Supplemental Document 1 for a\ntabulated overview of the entire quality assessment outcom e).\nThe quality assessment of studies revealed that the descript ion\nof ARCI samples was frequently poor, with many authors failing\nto state whether they were abstinent, if they were diagnosed\naccording to nosological criteria (e.g., DSM or ICD), how\nthey were diagnosed, and whether those with complicating\ncomorbid disorders (e.g., dementia) were excluded. Additio nally,\none reviewed study (\nWeintraub et al., 2000 ) and several more\nidentiﬁed during the study selection process failed to state\nwhether their sample’s KS was alcohol-related or caused by som e\nother etiology (e.g., bariatric surgery), requiring revie wers to\ncontact the authors directly. The distinction between etiol ogies\nis important as the two may result in diﬀerent cognitive proﬁles\n(\nNikolakaros et al., 2016 ). Similarly, the only two studies which\nassessed participants with a speciﬁc diagnosis of ARBD provided\nlittle participant description, did not refer to diagnostic cri teria,\nand one failed to state whether the sample was inclusive of tho se\nwith KS or ARD diagnoses (i.e.,\nHorton et al., 2015b ).\nMethodological and statistical errors were also frequent.\nFirstly, there was a risk of circularity in studies exploring\nthe sensitivity of tests as many authors reported using\nneuropsychological assessment to inform diagnostic decision s,\nthereby inﬂating the apparent diagnostic value of the test\nobserved on repeat testing. This was noted by\nWester et al.\n(2013c) as a particular issue in their evaluation of the RBMT-\n3’s sensitivity to KS, though was avoided by Wester et al.\n(2013b) in their appraisal of the MoCA in KS and ALC\nparticipants. Secondly, while reviewer calculated eﬀect sizes\nwere typically large between ARCI and control samples,\nmany studies included small sample sizes (72% investigated\n<25 ARCI participants) suggesting they may have lacked\nthe statistical power to detect more subtle between-group\ndiﬀerences (type-II error) or produced misleading statisticall y\nsigniﬁcant results (type-I error;\nButton et al., 2013 ). Thirdly,\nmost studies failed to report eﬀect sizes when conducting\nappropriate analyses. While this can often be easily calculated\nby readers (as done here), multiple authors in the included\nstudies commended the discriminatory value of a test based\nsolely on statistical signiﬁcance between groups (e.g.,\nOscar-\nBerman et al., 2004 ), which does not provide information\nregarding the relative size of the discrepancy. Given the\nadditional information provided by their inclusion and the\nlimitations of P values (see\nSullivan and Feinn, 2012 ), we\nrecommend all future studies in this ﬁeld report eﬀect sizes wh ere\nrelevant.\nDISCUSSION\nThe present review aimed to synthesize and discuss studies\nevaluating neuropsychological tools used in the assessment o f\nAlcohol-Related Cognitive Impairment (ARCI). Overall, the\nreviewed studies present a clear picture of widespread cognitiv e\nimpairment increasing in severity from AL through ALC and\non to varying forms of more severe ARCI, highlighting the\nimportance of neuropsychological evaluation. Compared with\nHorton et al.’s (2015a)previous review on this topic, we reviewed\n26 additional studies and discussed multiple outcomes of inte rest\nnot identiﬁed within their review.

A summary and discussion of\nkey ﬁndings is now presented.\nCognitive Screening\nCSIs are useful in providing a preliminary indication of the\nseverity of cognitive impairment. Both the MoCA and MMSE\nhave demonstrated some value in distinguishing those with A RCI\nfrom those without and between gradations of alcohol-relate d\nimpairment, though the MoCA appears the superior of the two\n(\nWester et al., 2013c; Oudman et al., 2014 ). Although, clinicians\nusing CSIs with this population should be cognizant of the\nconsiderable risk of false-positive and false-negative out comes\nand avoid making deﬁnitive diagnostic decisions purely on the\nbasis of their use.\nIn the wider literature, additional support for the MoCA\ncomes from\nPelletier et al. (2016) who found it proved useful\nin monitoring improvements in cognitive function in ALs\nundergoing rehabilitation. However, it is not clear whether\nthe authors’ ﬁndings simply reﬂect a learning eﬀect, given the\nshort duration (M = 33.5 days, SD = 7) between the two\nadministration points. CSIs have also been criticized in the\nwider literature for their poor sensitivity to alcohol-relat ed\nmemory disorders (\nBenedict and Brandt, 1992; Munro et al.,\n2001). Consequently, additional memory testing may be useful\nduring initial assessments. Additionally, CSIs may be of lit tle\nuse in discriminating between ARCI and other neurocognitiv e\ndisorders such as Alzheimer’s, with little observable diﬀer ence\nin MMSE scores between groups ( Osuntokun et al., 1994;\nSaxton et al., 2000 ). Overall, while CSIs provide quick, easily\nadministered assessments of cognitive function, there is a need\nfor more comprehensive testing following screening to ensur e\ncorrect diagnosis.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 32 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al.

The memory deﬁcit of ALs can often be distinguished\nfrom that of KS not only by lesser severity, but also by a faste r rate\nof learning which is comparable to the rate of healthy individ uals\n(Brokate et al., 2003 ).\nBoth the RBMT-3 and CVLT discriminate well between\nKS, ALC and non-ALs, with an overall graded picture of\nincreasing memory impairment from AL through ALC to KS\non both measures. Compared with the RBMT-3, the CVLT\nappears slightly more sensitive to ARCI and provides a more\ncomprehensive overview of verbal memory and learning indice s.\nStill, the RBMT-3 demonstrates comparably excellent sensitiv ity\nand speciﬁcity and may provide clinically useful information\nregarding the implications of the memory deﬁcit for a person’s\nday-to-day functioning. The WMS is also sensitive to the memo ry\ndeﬁcits of those with ARCI, testing both episodic and working\nmemory for verbal and visual stimuli. The WMS has, however,\nbeen criticized for its long administration time and cumber some\nscoring system, which may preclude use in clinical settings\n(\nKent, 2013). Yet, more accurate assessments of memory function\ndepend on detailed testing, for which the WMS may be useful.\nValidation of the latest version of the test, the WMS-IV , is\nrequired for this group.\nAutobiographical Memory\nIndividuals with KS display temporally graded results on\nautobiographical memory tests, with more recent memories\nbeing most impaired, memories from early adulthood often\nbest preserved and childhood memories slightly impaired in\ncomparison (although these last two periods can vary in which\nis best remembered;\nKopelman, 1989; Rensen et al., 2016 ). The\ndecline in preserved memories from early adulthood to more\nrecent memories in KS is particularly steep, signiﬁcantly mor e\nso than the decline observed over the same period in those\nwith Alzheimer’s disease (\nKopelman, 1989 ). The AMI appears\nsuperior to the AI, demonstrating superior inter-rater relia bility\nand greater discriminatory ability between KS and control g roups\n(Rensen et al., 2016 ).\nProcedural Memory\nMixed ﬁndings have been observed in relation to procedural\nmemory function in those with ARCI, likely because the cognit ive\nsequelae of chronic alcoholism—including episodic memory\ndeﬁcits, executive dysfunction, and visuospatial problems—m ake\nthe isolated assessment of procedural learning challenging in\nthis population (\nHayes et al., 2012 ). For example, the procedural\naspect of Tower-Tests may only be accessible after the initia l\nproblem-solving element is addressed. Wester et al. (2013a)\nhave suggested the RBMT-3’s new Novel Task may assess\nprocedural learning, though probably also recruits episodic\nmemory and visuospatial processes for completion. Nonetheles s,\ngiven the ease of administering it within the RBMT-3 battery,\nthe Novel Task may provide a valuable addition to clinical\nmemory assessment in those with ARCI. The discussion of\nprocedural memory assessment presented here is circumscribe d\nby our decision to focus on standardized, normatively deﬁned\nneuropsychological tests (many investigations of procedura l\nmemory in those with ARCI rely on experimental procedures).\nFor a comprehensive overview of this domain, we recommend\nthe reviews of implicit memory function and procedural learni ng\nin KS provided by\nHayes et al. (2012) and Oudman et al. (2015) ,\nrespectively.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 33 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al. Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\nWorking Memory\nIndividuals with all forms of ARCI display impairments in\nworking memory (\nvan Geldorp et al., 2012 ), as do ALs to a lesser\nextent ( Pitel et al., 2008 ). The BP-Task appears sensitive to the\nworking memory deﬁcits associated with alcoholism, particul arly\nat longer delay times ( Ryan and Butters, 1980; Leng and Parkin,\n1989), though is also dependent on an ability to shift attention\naway from the distracting activity and not perseverate. Task s\nrelying on immediate recall of verbal or visual stimuli may\nnot reveal deﬁcits in working memory (\nBlackburn and Tyrer,\n1985; van Geldorp et al., 2012 ), with some delay necessary for\nidentifying deﬁcits. Psychometric validation of tests spec iﬁcally\ndesigned to test working memory in those with ARCI is scant\nand therefore warranted.\nConfabulation\nThe early stage of WKS is associated with both provoked\nand spontaneous confabulations. Accordingly, the assessme nt\nof confabulatory behavior may provide important diagnostic\ninformation (\nBorsutzky et al., 2008; Rensen et al., 2017 ). The\nuse of the Intrusions variable of the CVLT as an index\nof confabulation is questionable. The ﬁndings from\nRensen,\nOosterman, van Damme, Griekspoor, Wester and Kopelman\n(2015, 2017) suggest intrusions, while related to confabulations,\nmay be distinct phenomena. The NVCL-20 observational scale\nfor measuring confabulatory behavior appears more suitable\nfor assessing confabulation in those with ARCI, demonstrat ing\nsuperior psychometric properties to other measures used for thi s\npurpose. The NVCL-20 is the only confabulation measure to be\nspeciﬁcally validated in an ARCI population and to provide a\nquantiﬁcation of spontaneous confabulation.\nExecutive Function\nThe testing of EF represents an important element of ARCI\nassessment, particularly as impairments may have deleterious\nconsequences for rehabilitation and treatment eﬀorts (\nBates\net al., 2002, 2005 ). Executive dysfunction is now an accepted\nfeature of KS, with impaired performance in tasks requiring\nplanning (\nJoyce and Robbins, 1991 ), rule detection and following\n(Kopelman, 1991 ), verbal ﬂuency ( Fujiwara et al., 2008 ), and\ncognitive estimation ( Taylor and O’Carroll, 1995 ). Compared\nwith ALs, KS demonstrate considerably poorer performance\non tests of EF (\nMaharasingam et al., 2013 ), leading some to\nconclude that such impairments represent unique sequelae of\norganic KS and are not the result of alcohol neurotoxicity\n(\nKrabbendam et al., 2000; Brokate et al., 2003 ). Nonetheless,\nthe literature is replete with evidence of impaired performanc e\non various measures of EF in ALs compared with controls\n(\nMoriyama et al., 2002; Oscar-Berman et al., 2004; Pitel\net al., 2007 ), which does not appear to be accounted for by\ndiﬀerences in age or education. Thus, it seems the severe\nexecutive deﬁcits of KS are superimposed on top of existing,\nalbeit milder, impairments resulting from chronic alcoholis m\nand related factors; although this could include sub-clini cal\nepisodes of thiamine deﬁciency (\nPitel et al., 2011 ). Findings\nrelating to samples with diagnoses other than KS are scant,\nthough one study found 65% of a small sample ( n = 16)\nwith ARBD performed within impaired ranges on a test of\nEF (\nHorton et al., 2015b ), but it is not clear from the\nsample description whether this included individuals with WKS\ndiagnoses.\nDespite substantially more impaired executive abilities\nobserved in those with KS compared with ALs, less sensitive\nmeasures of EF such as the MoCA ’s EF subtest may result\nin little diﬀerence between these groups (\nWester et al.,\n2013c), emphasizing the need for more sensitive measures. The\necologically-based battery assessment of EF, the BADS, appea rs\nsensitive to KS-related deﬁcits across multiple subtests and can\ndiﬀerentiate these from AL impairments ( Maharasingam et al.,\n2013). KS performance on the BADS is not consistent across\nsubtests, highlighting the need to examine subtest scores i n\naddition to the overall proﬁle score ( Van Den Berg et al., 2009 ). In\nterms of ecological validity, high scores on the Proﬁle scor e and\nTemporal Judgment and Zoo Map sub-tests have been associated\nwith subsequent occupational success in ALs, though no link\nbetween BADS scores and drinking outcomes was observed\n(\nMoriyama et al., 2002 ).\nIndividuals with KS perform particularly poorly on tests of\nrule derivation such as the WCST, MCST, and BPSAT compared\nwith controls and those with psychiatric disorders and other\nneurological conditions (\nShoqeirat et al., 1990; Van Den Berg\net al., 2009 ). Multiple studies have also found evidence of\nimpaired cognitive estimation in KS ( Kopelman, 1991; Taylor\nand O’Carroll, 1995), although an earlier study found preserved\nperformance ( Leng and Parkin, 1988 ). The commonly used test\nof cognitive estimation, the CET, has previously been critic ized\nfor being culturally bound, but this issue has recently been\nresolved with the production of a revised CET (\nMacPherson\net al., 2014 ). Accurate cognitive estimations, however, may rely\non the retrieval of knowledge from semantic memory and the\nsubsequent error checking of this process as well as executive\nabilities (\nTaylor and O’Carroll, 1995 ). This view has since been\ncorroborated in KS participants using an alternative test of\ncognitive estimation (\nBrand et al., 2003 ) and supported in a\nreview of ﬁndings from various clinical groups ( Wagner et al.,\n2011).\nThere appears to be little inter-correlation between tests of\nsingle EFs, including the CET, FAS, WCST, and MCST ( Shoqeirat\net al., 1990; Kopelman, 1991 ). Dissattenuated correlations (i.e.,\ncorrelations corrected for the unreliability of the test sco res)\nbetween the EF test scores were, however, not considered here\nand may be stronger than those originally reported (\nSchmidt\nand Hunter, 1996 ). Nonetheless, the lack of correlations is\nperhaps unsurprising as, although estimations of quantities,\nverbal ﬂuency, and rule detection may depend on some common\nskills (e.g., attention), they likely recruit diﬀerent skill s for their\ncompletion. This view is consistent with studies using latent\nvariable analyses to study the diversity of executive abilit ies which\nhave concluded that EFs are separable but related functions\nthat share some level of underlying commonality (e.g.,\nMiyake\net al., 2000; Friedman et al., 2008 ). The resulting models of EF\nfrom these investigations distinguish between key function s such\nas shifting, inhibition and updating, with some also includin g\nworking memory and planning ( Snyder et al., 2015 ). Such models\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 34 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al. Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\ncould provide a useful theoretical basis for testing EFs in th ose\nwith ARCI; although the EF tests identiﬁed here mostly asses s\nshifting (e.g., WCST, BSPAT) and planning (e.g., BADS Zoo Map\nTest), with tests of ﬂuency and cognitive estimations not ne atly\nﬁtting within existing models of EF (see\nSnyder et al., 2015 ).\nInhibition can be tested using the BADS or CANTAB response\ninhibition tests reviewed here, while updating is typically t ested\nby paradigms such as the Spatial 2-back or Keep Track tests\nused by\nFriedman et al. (2008) , indicating a need to incorporate\nstandardized updating tasks into existing batteries.\nIntelligence and Test Batteries\nImpairments on intelligence tests have also been observed in\nthose with ARCI, particularly on subtests that involve proces sing\nspeed, working and episodic memory, and executive abilities.\nOnly two test batteries were evaluated by included studies, the\nWAIS and CANTAB. The WAIS is often viewed as the gold-\nstandard assessment of intelligence and general ability (\nHayes\net al., 2016 ). Those with ARCI, particularly KS, demonstrate\nbetter performance on the Verbal IQ (VIQ) components of the\nWAIS compared with the Performance IQ (PIQ) components;\nthough the reverse has also been documented (\nOscar-Berman\net al., 1993 ), highlighting heterogeneity within this population.\nA depressed WMS relative to WAIS IQ or VIQ may be\nindicative of KS, though we do not recommend using this\ndiscrepancy to diagnose the condition. The process has been\nrepeatedly criticized based on several inherent ﬂaws (\nDennis\net al., 2009; Kent, 2013 ). First, inferring memory dysfunction\nfrom the discrepancy is fallible, as an accurate measure of\npremorbid function from which any deterioration in IQ can\nalso be established is rarely available. Second, those at ex treme\nends of the IQ spectrum may produce misleading discrepancy\nscores. Third, WMS and WAIS performance are not exclusive\nas there is overlap between the skills used in both, particula rly\nworking memory processes (\nShipstead et al., 2016 ). Further, the\nhistorical view of KS as a circumscribed memory disorder is\nclearly challenged by the extant evidence, with wide-rangi ng\ncognitive deﬁcits observed in the studies reviewed here. In deed,\nBowden (1990) has argued that the strict selection criteria used\nfor KS by some researchers may have resulted in samples which\nwere unrepresentative of the more varied presentation typical of\nthis population. Accordingly,\nScalzo et al. (2015) report a case-\nseries investigation of those with WKS whose IQ minus MQ\nscores ranged widely from − 14 to 36, demonstrating the poor\ndiagnostic validity of the discrepancy approach.\nTests from the computerized CANTAB battery appear\nsensitive to the deﬁcits associated with ARCI, namely episod ic\nmemory and EF (\nHorton et al., 2015b ). The battery is\npsychometrically and practically appealing as its on-screen\nnature allows little room for administration or interpretat ion\nerrors, parallel versions of tests are available, and normed scores\nare calculated using a large and diverse normative database . The\ntests are also almost entirely visual in style and are theref ore\nunaﬀected by low verbal capabilities or cultural background.\nOverall, intelligence and battery assessments appear useful\nfor evaluating multiple cognitive abilities while using the same\nnormative sample for comparison. In addition, composite score s\nderived from battery tests are typically more reliable and be tter\npredictors of functional outcomes than single test scores (\nHarvey,\n2012). However, large batteries such as the WAIS can be time-\nconsuming and demanding for some, potentially explaining why\nmany studies have used only a selection of relevant subtests as\nopposed to the entire battery. Additionally, most batteries wi ll\nrequire the inclusion of auxiliary tests to cover all functi ons\nknown to be impaired in those with ARCI, such as orientation\nor aspects of memory and learning not assessed.\nPremorbid Ability\nThe assessment of premorbid intellectual function in those w ith\nARCI is essential for correctly interpreting the extent of th e\nsuspected cognitive deﬁcit. The NART may provide some value\nin predicting premorbid function in those with ARCI and the\nrevised version appears more eﬀective than the original. Still,\nit remains unknown whether NART performance is entirely\nimpervious to the deﬁcits associated with KS. Nonetheless, t he\nmeasure appears to be the common choice with this population\nand the NART-R has recently been re-standardized in a non-\nclinical British sample for the new WAIS-IV (\nBright et al., 2016 ),\nincreasing its application.\nFurther Considerations in the\nNeuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\nIn addition to test selection, several additional choices f ace\nclinicians using neuropsychological measures to assess ARC I.\nOne of the foremost of these is the decision as to when\ntests should be administered. A systematic review by\nWalvoort\net al. (2013) found it typically requires 6-weeks of abstinence\nbefore reliable neuropsychological performance can be achie ved.\nHowever, the use of cognitive screening tests during or\nimmediately following detoxiﬁcation is common practice and\nmay provide some indication of a person’s cognitive ability\n(\nRoyal College of Psychiatrists, 2014 ); although results should\nbe interpreted in the light of Walvoort and colleagues’ ﬁndin gs.\nThe use of repeat testing may also be important to track the\nchanges in cognition that have been observed during the ﬁrst 2\nyears post-detoxiﬁcation (\nStavro et al., 2013 ). The Royal College\nof Psychiatrists (2014) in the UK have suggested that following\ninitial assessments, more detailed cognitive assessments should\nbe undertaken after 3-months, then repeated at 6-month\nintervals for 3 years. This emphasizes the need to use tests tha t\nhave high test-retest reliability values and/or parallel ve rsions to\navoid practice eﬀects.\nSeveral person-speciﬁc factors should also be considered\nwhen interpreting the outcomes of cognitive testing in those\nsuspected of ARCI to ensure accurate interpretation. First am ong\nthese is the consideration of any comorbid psychopathology,\nas individuals with conditions such as depression (\nBosaipo\net al., 2017 ) and schizophrenia ( Bora and Pantelis, 2015 )\nhave been found to display decreased performance on various\ncognitive tests compared with matched controls. Relatedly,\npsychiatric medications can have varying eﬀects on cognitive\nperformance, both during and immediately following use (e.g. ,\nBouchard et al., 2015; Helmes and Ostbye, 2015 ). Additional\nnon-medical substance use including cocaine, heroin, cann abis,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 35 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al. Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\nand even (acutely) nicotine can also have deleterious eﬀects o n\ncognitive testing lasting for varying periods following abst inence,\nparticularly in those with co-morbid psychiatric disorders ( see\nGould, 2010 ); though one study has found no additional impact\nof cannabis use on MoCA scores in ALs ( Alarcon et al.,\n2015), suggesting the eﬀects may vary. Finally, the presence\nof cerebrovascular disease and traumatic brain injuries sh ould\nalso be considered due to their high prevalence (25%) within\nthis population (\nWilson et al., 2012 ). Together, these ﬁndings\nhighlight the need to combine neuropsychological testing wi th\na clinical diagnostic process and other assessment measures —\nprimarily neuroimaging and nutritional assessment ( Scalzo et al.,\n2015)—to ensure accurate diagnosis.\nDiagnostic Distinctions\nAs mentioned, few studies included in the review investigat ed\nnon-KS forms of ARCI, suggesting further investigations of\nthose with other diagnostic labels (e.g., ARD, ARBD) may\nbe warranted. However, the concept of a prolonged alcohol-\nrelated neurocognitive disorder with a distinct neuropatho logical\nbasis from WKS or other disorders of vitamin depletion (e.g.,\nPellagra) remains tenuous. Given the similarities in cogni tive\nproﬁles between groups with diagnoses of ARD, ARBD and KS\nseen here, the present review ﬁndings appear consistent with\nsuggestions that common neuropathological processes, namel y\nthiamine depletion, underpin most forms of ARCI (\nJoyce, 1994;\nZahr et al., 2011 ). This theory is supported by research with an\nAL population demonstrating a signiﬁcant correlation betwee n\nthiamine levels and memory performance, as well as a graded\ndecrease in cognitive ability with each symptom of WE (\nCaine\net al., 1997 criteria) present ( Pitel et al., 2011 ).\nSimilar cognitive proﬁles are also evident across gradation s\nof alcohol-related impairment, suggesting less impaired gro ups\nsit earlier in the same underlying pathological process as tho se\nwith KS. Indeed, AL & ALC groups appear to be impaired, to a\nlesser extent, on many of the same tests of memory (e.g.,\nPitel\net al., 2008; Wester et al., 2013b ) and general cognitive ability\n(e.g., Wester et al., 2013c ) as those with KS. However, those with\nKS typically display impaired performance on tests of recogniti on\nmemory and orientation, yet ALC and ARD populations perform\nat control-level (\nMunro et al., 2001; Wester et al., 2013b ),\nindicating that some neuropsychological distinctions (oth er than\nthose of degree) are evident when thiamine depletion progress es\nto the point of a KS diagnosis. Nonetheless, normal recogniti on\nmemory and an absence of disorientation have been observed i n\na case of KS meeting standard diagnostic criteria for the dis order\n(Noël et al., 2001 ), further highlighting the heterogeneity within\nthis population.\nThe present ﬁndings suggest it may be valuable from a\nclinical perspective to adopt a broad diagnostic conceptualiza tion\nof ARCI, assuming a degree of individual variability in\nthe particular functions impaired and where the extent of\nimpairment is the deciding factor in diagnostic decision mak ing;\nas opposed to trying to decide into which of the highly\noverlapping diagnostic categories (e.g., ARD, WKS) an individ ual\nbest ﬁts. Those adopting this view could acknowledge the\ncentral role of thiamine deﬁciency in producing ARCI (\nArts\net al., 2017 ), and still specify when a person’s symptomology\nclosely resembles KS, whilst also recognizing that various o ther\netiological factors (e.g., other nutritional deﬁciencies , impaired\nliver function etc.) can, like thiamine depletion, contribu te\nto varying degrees and may explain heterogeneity in degree\nand types of impairment observed (see\nBowden, 1990 ). The\nmore transient, but still signiﬁcant (e.g., Stavro et al., 2013 ),\neﬀects of alcohol neurotoxicity ( Arts et al., 2017 ) should also\nbe recognized within this broad approach, highlighting to\nclinicians the potential for recovery of certain functions o ver\ntime. This perspective closely resembles the DSM-5’s alcohol-\nrelated neurocognitive disorder, which bifurcates twice in to\nmild and severe forms and from the latter into amnestic and\nnon-amnestic types. The ARBD conceptualization postulated by\nWilson et al. (2012) —which encompasses WKS and all clinically\nsigniﬁcant forms of ARCI not meeting the criteria for WKS—\nmay also provide a highly pragmatic diagnostic conceptualizati on\nfor clinical use consistent with the above approach. That said ,\nif as the literature appears to suggest, that most cases of ARCI\nare variants of WKS caused by thiamine deﬁciency to a greater\nor lesser extent, then the term WKS may be more apt from\nan etiological perspective and has recently been advocated fo r\nuse in place of terms like ARD or ARBD (\nArts et al., 2017 ).\nThough, as mentioned, traditional views of WKS may fail to fu lly\ncapture the syndrome as experienced by alcohol users in regards\nto its heterogeneity and the contributing role of etiologic al factors\nother than thiamine depletion, particularly alcohol neuroto xicity.\nNonetheless, the value of neuropsychological assessment li es\nin characterizing the type and degree of cognitive dysfuncti on\nsuﬀered by alcohol-users and monitoring it over time, regardl ess\nof diagnostic categories and nomenclature.\nDirections for Future Research\nOverall, we recommend further appraisal of all tests discussed\nhere in those with ARCI, but a selection of more speciﬁc\nrecommendations for future studies are worthy of mention.\nFirst, the generalizability of ﬁndings and methodological ri gor\nof future research in this area can be improved by addressing\nsome of the limitations of the existing literature identiﬁed here,\nincluding clear reporting of abstinence duration, diagnosti c\ncriteria (particularly if assessing samples with “ARBD”), and\nthe methods used for diagnosis (including whether the tests\nevaluated contributed to diagnostic decisions). Second, furt her\nevaluations of the test re-test reliability of tests used wit h this\npopulation are necessary to ensure any variability in scores on\nrepeat testing represent true diﬀerences, not practice eﬀects.\nThird, to support clinicians in identifying those with or at ri sk of\nARCI, it would be beneﬁcial for studies to continue to identi fy\ntest cut-oﬀ scores which delineate gradations of impairment\n(e.g., from AL to ALC and more severe forms of ARCI), as has\nrecently been done for the MoCA and MMSE (\nWester et al.,\n2013c; Oudman et al., 2014 ). Fourth, it would also be useful to\nsee how well performance on tests reﬂects the ability to carry\nout activities of daily living and can predict functional out comes\nsuch as treatment adherence. While excluding treatment stud ies\nfrom the present review decreased the chance of identifying t hese\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 36 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al. Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\noutcomes, a brief review of the ARCI treatment and intervent ion\nliterature did not ﬁnd any such investigations.\nFifth, many of the most commonly employed neuro-\npsychological tools identiﬁed in Table 1 were not evaluated by\nany studies in the review and require investigation to support\ntheir continued use with this population. Two additional test s\nrequiring validation in this population are the Addenbrooke’ s\nCognitive Examination-III (ACE;\nHsieh et al., 2013 ) and\nRepeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological\nStatus (R-BANS). In an on-going investigation of ARCI\nprevalence by the present authors, these are the most commonly\nreported neuropsychological tools used by UK clinicians in the\nARCI diagnostic process. The ACE has demonstrated screening\nabilities commensurate with the MoCA and superior to the\nMMSE for AL impairments (\nRidley et al., 2017 ), but neither the\nACE nor R-BANS have been evaluated for use in ARCI diagnosis.\nFinally, two CSIs have recently been developed speciﬁcally\nfor assessing alcohol-related cognitive impairments, the\nBrief Examination of Alcohol-Related Neuropsychological\nImpairments (BEARNI;\nRitz et al., 2015 ) and the Test of\nDetection of Cognitive Impairment in Alcoholism (TEDCA;\nJurado-Barba et al., 2017 ), though both have only been validated\nin AL populations not meeting ARCI diagnostic criteria (both\nCSIs can be accessed in the corresponding publications [the\nBEARNI is in French]). The BEARNI was designed as an easily\nadministered CSI for assessing the deﬁcits associated with\nalcoholism: working and episodic memory, visuospatial abili ties,\nEF, and ataxia. In its validation,\nRitz et al. (2015) found the\nBEARNI was considerably more sensitive when diﬀerentiating\nbetween ALs and controls (sensitivity = 98.4%) compared\nwith the MMSE (9.5%) and Dementia Rating Scale (7.9%;\nCoblentz et al., 1973 ). However, the tool displayed relatively\npoor speciﬁcity (50%). The TEDCA appears highly similar to\nthe BEARNI in its assessment of working and episodic memory\nand visuospatial skills. The TEDCA ’s assessment of EF, howev er,\nappears more comprehensive, including the Trail Making Test-B ,\nconceptual similarity tests (e.g., “What do food & gasoline h ave\nin common?”), and a go-nogo task; compared with only a\ncategory ﬂuency test in the BEARNI. The TEDCA demonstrated\nmoderate sensitivity (67%) and good speciﬁcity (76.7%) when\ndiﬀerentiating between ALs and controls (\nJurado-Barba et al.,\n2017), although these ﬁndings are obfuscated by the failure to\nstate whether ALs were abstinent during testing. Overall, bo th\ntests are valuable additions to the assessment of this populati on\nand possess several strengths: short administration time, a n\nability to be administered by non-specialists, and a focus on the\nkey areas of alcohol-related cognitive impairment. A priorit y for\nfuture research in this area should be to evaluate the screen ing\ncapabilities of both tests for those with ARCI diagnoses such as\nKS.\nLimitations of the Review\nThe present review may be limited by the exclusion of\nstudies evaluating non-standardized tests without normat ive\ndata, as there may be tests not meeting these criteria which\nare particularly useful in the assessment of ARCI. However,\nexpanding the review to include such tests would be beyond\nthe scope of a single review and the evaluation of standardized\nnormatively deﬁned tests is likely of most value to those invo lved\nin the assessment of ARCI. Second, this review considered onl y\none test of aﬀect or social cognition (WMS-III Face Recognition\nTest;\nHoldnack and Delis, 2004 ) indicating the lack of studies\nevaluating standardized tests of these domains. If consideri ng\nARCI from a dual-processing perspective (e.g., Helfrich et al.,\n2018), as has recently been advocated ( Brion et al., 2015 ), then\nthe tests reviewed here focus mostly on the “reﬂective syste m”\nsystem (which draws upon memory and EF to initiate considered,\ndeliberate responses), with few assessing the aﬀective compone nt\nof the “aﬀective-automatic” system responsible for the impulsi ve\nprocessing of stimuli, including decoding the aﬀective quali ty of\na stimulus. This is notable as tests of aﬀect and social cognit ion\nmay prove informative for those involved in the treatment of\nthis population (\nBrion et al., 2015 ). For example, ALs and\nthose with KS display impaired processing of emotional facial\nexpressions and, in the former group, this has been associated\nwith interpersonal dysfunction (\nKornreich et al., 2001; Montagne\net al., 2006; Donadon and Osório, 2014 ). Thus, tests of aﬀect\nshould also be considered when assessing ARCI; to date, howe ver,\nstudies in this domain are scant ( Arts et al., 2017 ).\nThird, we did not include studies evaluating\nneuropsychological tools in AL participants, which could\nhave provided additional information on the utility of tests for\nthe assessment of alcohol-related deﬁcits. However, we have\nintroduced some of the more pertinent and up-to-date evidence\nrelating to ALs (e.g.,\nAlarcon et al., 2015; Ritz et al., 2015 )\ninto our discussion to supplement the review ﬁndings. Fourth,\nseveral studies in the review evaluated older versions of te sts\nused today (e.g., WMS/WAIS editions), thus caution should be\ntaken in applying these ﬁndings to newer versions. Although\nolder versions are likely conceptually and structurally sim ilar,\nthey should not be viewed as the same test (\nStrauss et al., 2006 ).\nFinally, the ﬁndings from older studies in the review should be\ninterpreted carefully as they were considerably more likely tha n\nnewer studies to contain methodological weakness (e.g., lac k of\ndiagnostic criteria and short abstinence duration).\nCONCLUSIONS AND\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThrough an extensive review of the literature in this area, t he\npresent systematic review has provided a novel overview of ARC I\nassessment, including a direct understanding of each test’ s utility\ncompared with other tests of the same function. While evidenc e\nconcerning the psychometric, diagnostic and practical values of\ntests in assessing ARCI appears to be in its infancy compared\nwith other disorders (e.g., dementias), the systematic col lation\nand comparison of studies conducted here makes it possible to\nproﬀer a number of provisional recommendations for tests in\neach domain of assessment.\nThe MoCA is the most well-evidenced CSI of choice in\nthis population, but the ACE, BEARNI, and TEDCA all\nrequire validation and comparison to determine the more\neﬀective measure. The CVLT and RBMT are recommended\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 37 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2618\nHeirene et al. Neuropsychological Assessment of ARCI\nfor more detailed memory assessment. The WMS is also\nlikely to be of value, and the optional tests of orientation\n(i.e., WMS-IV Cognitive Status Exam) should be included;\nalthough the most recent WMS-IV has not been evaluated\nin this population. The NVCL-20 should be the choice\nassessment of confabulation. Rule derivation tests (e.g., W CST)\nare sensitive measures of executive dysfunction in those wi th\nARCI, with the BSPAT possessing greatest psychometric support.\nHowever, the BADS is recommended as a more comprehensive\nassessment of EF given the diﬀerential levels of impairment\nobserved across EF tests in this group. The WAIS is the\nmost commonly used and well-validated measure of intellige nce\nin those with ARCI and its continued use appears justiﬁed;\nparticularly if using its memory-focused analog (WMS) to\npermit direct comparison across functions using the same\nnormative reference data. However, other test batteries (e .g., R-\nBANS) have received little evaluation of their utility to da te.\nWhen determining premorbid function, the NART-R is the\ntest of choice, though requires further evaluation in those with\nKS. Overall, while test selection will ultimately depend on a\nvariety of factors, including the preferences and goals of th e\nadministrator, the present ﬁndings can assist clinicians an d\nresearchers assessing ARCI by supporting eﬃcient, evidence-\nbased decisions.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nAll authors contributed to the conception and design of the\nreview.
