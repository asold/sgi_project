  "abstract": "In battery charging applications, the charger changes its output voltage in a wide range during the charging process. This makes the design of LLC converters difficult to be optimized between the efficiency and the gain range. In this paper, an improved resonant transformer is presented for LLC resonant converter charger to improve the gain adjustment and charger efficiency. The resonant inductance and magnetizing inductance are integrated in the designed LLC transformer, and the magnetizing inductance can be adjusted dynamically with the change of output voltage and load, which is realized by a switch-controlled inductor (SCI) parallel to the secondary winding of transformer. The proposed transformer has 22.4% reduction in losses under full load conditions compared to conventional solutions. Moreover, the conduction loss and switching loss of LLC resonant tank are reduced by dynamically adjusting the magnetizing inductance, which improves the comprehensive efficiency of the whole charging process. The proposed transformer design is verified on a 720 W prototype.",
