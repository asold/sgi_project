I NTRODUCTION\nI\nN the last three decades, several isolated DC-DC converter\ntopologies have been widely investigated in the literature\nfor integrating distributed DC power sources, storage units,\nand DC loads, enhancing the power transfer capability and\nincreasing the conversion efﬁciency [1]–[5]. However the\nisolated multiport DC-DC converters, in particular, those based\non the MWT have been drawn more attention [6]–[20], due to\ntheir advantages in the applications where multiple DC sources\nand/or loads should be integrated, while ensuring galvanic\nisolation and adopting different voltage levels among the ports.\nIn the literature, the MWT was ﬁrst introduced as the key\nelement of a multiple-output DC-DC converter by [6] in 1970s.\nIn this converter, the concept based on the cross-regulation\n(proposed in [21] for a three-winding transformer) was used\nto ensure the adjustment of the output voltages through the\nmagnetic coupling. Afterwards, in 1990s by [22], the same\nManuscript received October 26, 2020; revised January 31, 2021; accepted\nFebruary 27, 2021.

Then, based on this work,\na bidirectional four-ports version employing a four-winding\ntransformer and a family of multiport bidirectional DC-DC\nconverters were proposed by [8] and [9], respectively.\nDerived from the dual-active-bridge (DAB), in [9]–[12], the\ntriple-active-bridge (TAB) was introduced with the same aim\nof integrating simultaneously multiple DC sources and loads.\nConcurrently, a three-port version of the series-resonant (SR)\nconverter was introduced by [24]. However, only in [13], [14],\nthe TAB and QAB converters were generalized for an arbitrary\nnumber of coupled cells with the called multiple-active-bridge\n(MAB). Finally, other papers have gradually arisen in the\nliterature to further investigate these converters in several\napplication ﬁelds, e.g. solid-state transformer (SST), electric\nvehicles (EVs), hybrid grids, and DC networks [15]–[20].\nAs there are hundreds of possible topologies for multiport\nconverters based on MWT and their potentials and challenges\nhave so far not been fully covered in the literature, this\npaper proposes a novel class denoted MTB DC-DC converters.\nUnlike the classical modular converter based on multiple\ntwo-winding transformers (2WT), the MTB converters have\nmore degrees of freedom in terms of architecture: symmet-\nrical (equal number of cells in both side of the MWT)\nor asymmetrical (different number of cells in both side),\nwhich enlarge the opportunities in many application ﬁelds\nwith different design requirements. Thus, derived in general\nfrom well-deﬁned DC-DC converters (as DAB and SR), the\nMTB converters arise as promising solution of isolated and\nmodular DC-DC converter, preserving similar characteristics.\nNevertheless, the advantages and issues of each of them have\nnot been thoroughly investigated yet in the literature.\nIn this context, the MTB converters are systematically\naddressed and evaluated in a generic approach, merging the\ntopologies in categories regarding their architecture, resonant\nand non-resonant operation. Furthermore, an assessment and\ncomparison are further addressed in terms of number of cells,\npower density, semiconductor technologies, power losses, cost\nand reliability. In this analysis, the classical modular solution\nbased on multiples isolated DC-DC converters using 2WT\nis considered for sake of comparison.

As a result, this can lead to\nhigher power density and efﬁciency.\nHowever, the common magnetic core and its resulting\ncoupling bring speciﬁc challenges depending on the number\nof windings and their arrangement. Thus, the impact of the\nundesired cross-coupling and the parameter deviation are high-\nlighted and then a proper winding structure is proposed for dif-\nferent core geometries. Additionally, a fault-tolerant approach\nbased on the MWT is introduced, taking into account the\nreconﬁguration and continuous operation of the system even\nunder a fault condition. Therefore, the main goal of this paper\nis to provide an overview of the MTB DC-DC Converters\nfrom the topology perspective, considering their potentials and\nchallenges. The novelty arises from the explanation of these\ntwo points in a comprehensive way. As the ﬁnal outcome, the\nmain MTB topologies are quantitatively compared.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II shows an\noverview and classiﬁcation of the MTB topologies. Section III\nintroduces the potential and challenges of the MWT in MTB\ntopologies, describing the MWT redundancy approach and its\nfeatures to keep the continuous operation. Section IV presents\nthe interconnection and operation modes issues. Section V\nshows the quantitative analysis among the MTB converter.\nFinally, the outcomes are presented in Section VI.\nII. A RCHITECTURE AND OPERATION PRINCIPLE OF THE\nMTB DC-DC C ONVERTERS\nA. Generic Scheme of the MTB Topologies\nA MTB DC-DC converter consists of several cells con-\nnected to the same MWT, as illustrated in Figure 1. In this\nmodular architecture, the MWT performs an important role\nestablishing the high-frequency magnetic coupling between\nthe cells and consequently composing the modules and the\noverall power converter. Thus, the architecture of the MTB\nDC-DC converter can be generically deﬁned by combining of:\nFigure 1. Generic scheme of the MTB topologies, consisting of different\ncells (switched network based on active, hybrid and passive bridges) coupled\nmagnetically by using the MWT to compose the modules (building blocks)\nand then these modules are combined to create the entire system. Where\nVDC,i and VDC,j are the DC voltages, vpri,i and vsec,j are the AC voltages\non each port of the MWT, and ai,j the turn-ratio.\nFigure 2. Generic classiﬁcation of the MTB topologies.\niprimary-side cells Ncells,pri (whereas i= 1,2,...,N cells,pri);\nireactive networks; jsecondary-side cells Ncells,sec, (whereas\nj = 1, 2,...,N cells,sec); and a MWT with the number of\nwindings (Nw) divided in i and j ports (i.e. Nw = i+ j) of\nturn-ratio ai,j = vsec,j/vpri,i (or ai,j = nsec,j/npri,i, where\nnpri,i is the number of turns on the ith primary-side cell and\nnsec,j on jth secondary-side cell).\nIt should be noted that the reactive network is represented\nin this paper as the combination of the primary side elements\nwith the reﬂected ones, from the secondary side, in a single\nreactive network arranged by the equivalent elements. As can\nbe seen, assuming a power ﬂow from primary to the secondary\nside, the structure is composed ﬁrstly by an inverter stage (DC-\nAC stage) and then by a rectiﬁer stage (AC-DC stage). In\nthe middle, it is placed the MWT in series with the reactive\nnetwork, which provides the resonant or non-resonant behavior\nfor the DC-DC converter, depending on the arrangement of\nthe reactive components: capacitor, leakage inductor (or an\nexternal inductor) and magnetizing inductance.\nB. Classiﬁcation of MTB DC-DC Topologies\nIn general, the MTB topologies can be classiﬁed according\nto its operation mode (such as resonant or non-resonant\nbehavior), and according to its architecture symmetry (e.g.\nasymmetrical and symmetrical structure) as shown in Figure 2.\n1) Resonant and Non-resonant Operation Mode: The re-\nactive network is composed by reactive components and is\nused to modify the shapes of the switch current waveforms in\norder to deﬁne the resonant or non-resonant behavior of the\npower converter. Occasionally, these reactive elements are not\nnecessarily required, since they will always be present in prac-\ntice due to the inherent parasitic elements of the transformer\n(e.g. leakage/magnetizing inductances and capacitances). In\nthis context, the SR, LLC (resonant) and DAB (non-resonant)\nconverter have been used as a building block of the MTB\ntopologies, because of their characteristics of soft-switching,\nhigh efﬁciency, and power density [9], [11], [12], [18].\nThe SR converter presents a well-regulated output voltage\nfor a wide range of load, avoiding the requirement of close-\nloop control and also reducing the number of sensors. For that\nreason, SR converter is also denominated DC transformer [1],\n[17], [18]. Its reactive network is composed by a resonant\ncapacitor connected in series to a resonant inductor. Reducing\nthe ratio between the resonant and the magnetizing inductance\nof the transformer leads to the LLC converter, which enhances\nthe voltage-control capability compared to SR converters [38].\nWhen output voltage control or power-ﬂow control is\nrequired, the DAB converter becomes a promising option,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universitat Kiel.

Architecture classiﬁcation of the MTB topologies regarding the\nsymmetry: (a) symmetrical conﬁguration (i.e. i = j) and (b) asymmetrical\nconﬁguration (i.e. i < j, with at least one cell Ncell,pri = 1), similarly its\nswapped version is also valid (i.e. i>j , with Ncell,sec = 1).\nbecause it operates with active control of the power ﬂow.\nThe reactive network of the DAB is composed typically by\na resonant inductor, which acts as a power transfer element\nbetween the cells. The amount of transferred power depends\non the applied voltage across the reactive network and it is\nconventionally controlled by means of a phase-shift between\nthese voltages. In some cases, the reactive network can also\ncontain a capacitor to block the undesired DC component on\nthe current, avoiding a saturation of the transformer.\n2) Architecture Symmetry: Regarding the symmetry, MTB\ntopologies can be classiﬁed as symmetric and asymmetric,\ndepending on how the cells are coupled to the MWT. When\nconﬁgured symmetrically, the number of cells are equally\ndivided in both sides of the MWT, i.e. Ncell,pri = Ncell,sec,\n[cf. Figure 3 (a)], or asymmetrically, where the cells are\nunequally coupled in one of the sides, i.e.Ncell,pri ̸= Ncell,sec,\nso that i > jor i < j), [cf. Figure 3 (b)]. As a matter of\nnomenclature, Ncells,i,j will be used to represent generically\nthe number of cells in one of the sides of the MWT, since\nthe converter can be bidirectional, the deﬁnition of primary\nand secondary side depends only on the power ﬂow direction.\nThus, when Ncells,i,j = 2, it means that there are two cells in\neach sides of the MWT for symmetrical conﬁguration (2 : 2)\nand two cells in only one side of MWT for asymmetrical\nconﬁguration (1 : 2), or also the swapped structure (2 : 1).\nFigure 4. A MWT with four winding: the magnetic ﬂux can be decomposed\ninto the main ﬂux, which links all the windings and is mainly conﬁned inside\nthe core, and leakage ﬂuxes, which link only one or two of three windings.\nC. Overview of the Main MTB DC-DC Converters\nConsidering the generic structure of the MTB DC-DC\nconverters and the latest publications on the topic, an overview\nof the MTB topologies is gathered in Table I. As can be\nseen, the table merges the main MTB topologies based on the\narchitecture symmetry along with different reactive networks.\nIII. A SSESSMENT AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE\nMTB DC-DC C ONVERTERS\nA. Potential of the MWT in MTB Topologies\nFigure 4 illustrates a MWT with four windings. Each wind-\ning leads a current with a voltage applied on its terminals. The\ninteraction of the currents and voltages result in a magnetic\nﬁeld. The magnetic ﬂux in the ﬁeld can be decomposed into:\n(i) main ﬂux, Φm, which couple all the windings; (ii) self-\nleakage inductances, Φ1, Φ2, Φ3, and Φ4; and (iii) mutual\nleakage inductances, Φ12, Φ13, Φ14, Φ23, Φ24; which couples\ntwo of the four windings as represented by their subscripts.\nAs a result, the magnetic coupling allows the MTB topologies\nto integrate multiples sources/load of different power/voltage\nlevels using fewer cells, cf. Figure 5 (a)-(c).

As can be seen\nin Figure 6 (a), some core material can be saved when the\n2WT is replaced by the MWT [cf. Figure 6 (b)-(c)], as listed\nin Table II for U-core, E-core, and ETD-core. Therefore, the\nconcept of connecting magnetically the cells to compose the\nentire MTB DC-DC converter with MWT leads to beneﬁts\nthat can be demonstrated, using the 2WT in a conventional\nmodular approach (i.e 2WT-based topologies), as reference.\nThus, as a FOM, the area product Ap of a MWT [44], [45]\nFigure 7. Interconnection among multiple DC sources (e.g PV system, storage\nsystem, super-capacitor and so on) considering systems based on: (a) multiple\n2WTs and (b) one MWT.\n[cf. (1)] can be used for deriving a scaling law, relating the\nvolume of the MWT with the number of cells Ncells,pri for\nany architecture (symmetrical or asymmetrical) [cf. Figure 3].\nAp =\n∑i+j\nk=0(vrms,k)(irms,k)\nKf KufswJrms ˆB\n= ST\nKf KufswJrms ˆB\n(1)\nWhere vrms,k is the applied rms voltage of the kth-winding,\nKf is the form factor depending on the waveform shape, ST\nis the total apparent power for a MWT with Nw windings,\nKu is the core window utilization factor, fsw is the switching\nfrequency, Jrms is the rms current density and ˆB the peak\nvalue of the magnetic ﬂux density.\nOnce the area product is proportional to the total apparent\npower ST and also to the volume of the MWT VMWT (i.e.\nAp ∝ST ∝VMWT), they can be related to the processed\npower. Thus, in a simpliﬁed approach, the MWT can be\nconsidered a simple cube, so that VMWT ∝ (ST )\n3\n4 [44],\n[46]. Assuming that 2WT is a particular design of MWT (i.e.\nNcell,pri = Ncell,sec = 1), its volume can be expressed by\nV2WT = kV ol(ST )\n3\n4 , where kV olis the ratio between the core\nsize of the 2WT and MWT (i.e. 0 <kV ol≤1).\nFor instance, considering the particular application, where\nmultiple DC sources should be interconnected by means of\na common DC bus, cf. Figure 7 (a)-(b). As can be noted,\nthe power-paths between the sources can be shortened when\nthe MWT is adopted, due to its inherent magnetic link, which\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universitat Kiel.

Figure 7 (a). As a\nresult, since the structure uses less cells, the power density\nof the MTB topologies can be increased when the MWT is\nadopted, cf. Figure 7 (b). Therefore, assuming the all windings\nprocess the same power, the volume ratio between MWT and\nmultiple 2WTs (N2WT) can be expressed in terms of the\nnumber of sources (i.e Ncell,pri), as deﬁned in (2), which is\nvalid only for Ncell,pri ≥2.\nVMWT\nV2WT\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\nasym\n= 1\nkV olN2WT\n(\nNcell,pri + 1\n2\n)0.75\n(2)\nHence, as expected, the total MWT volume in asymmetrical\nconﬁguration scales with the number of cells compared to\nmultiple 2WT-based converters (cf. Figure 8). However, for\nthe speciﬁc application, where the insulated cell of the AMTB\ntopologies have to process the total power of the system,\nthe MWT cannot be further scaled down, because the power\nprocessed by the windings of 2WT and MWT are the same\n(i.e ST,MWT = ST,2WT ), so that the Ap is nearly the same\n[cf. (1)]. Thus, for this kind of application, the only achievable\nreduction in the MWT is given by the fewer required amount\nof core material. Moreover, the MTB topologies are also\ncomposed by the cells, which have a signiﬁcantly impact on\nthe system volume and hence to the power density. Therefore,\nin order to evaluate their inﬂuence on the overall power\ndensity, the volume of the cells needs to be also deﬁned.\nWhereas the SMTB and 2WT-based topologies can be fully\ncomposed by Ncells,i,j identical cells of volume Vo,cell, the\nAMTB topologies is composed by the same Ncells,i,j cells\nand only one insulated cell which might has its volume\nVo,icell varying according to the total power processed. This\nmeans that Vo,icell depends on several factor, such as topology\nand components adopted to implement this insulated cell\n(in particular power semiconductor and heat-sinks), and its\ndesign itself. Therefore, Vo,icell can be generically derived by\nassuming two scenarios at a constant conversion efﬁciency\n(ηicell = ηcell). The ﬁrst and best one, it is considered\nthat the insulated cell is identical to the other cells, so that\nVo,icell = Vo,cell [cf. (3), where kv,cell = 1]. In other words,\nFigure 9. Power density ratio between the AMTB and 2WT-based topologies\nfor the same power level considering the cells with the same volume and then\nthe insulated cell with a volume proportional to the processed power.\nthe insulate is designed for achieving high-performance. The\nsecond and worst one, it is assumed that Vo,icell is proportional\nto the processed power and hence to the number of cells\n[cf. (3), where kv,cell = (Ncell,i,j)1.5].\nVo,icell = kv,cellVo,cell. (3)\nBased on both scenarios, the total volume of the different\narchitectures can be derived as deﬁned by (4), (5) and (6)\n(whereas 1 ≤ kv,cell ≤ (Ncell,i,j)1.5) for the 2WT-based\nconverters, SMTB and AMTB topologies, respectively.\nVTotal,2WT = 2Ncell,i,jVo,cell + Ncell,i,jV2WT (4)\nVTotal,SMTB = 2Ncell,i,jVo,cell + VMWT (5)\nVTotal,AMTB =\n(\nNcell,i,j + kv,cell\n)\nVo,cell + VMWT (6)\nThus, as a FOM, (4) and (5) can be used for presenting the\npower density beneﬁts and trade-offs of the AMTB topologies\nin comparison with 2WT-based ones, though the power density\nratio, which is expressed by (7).\nρAMTB\nρ2WT\n= 2Ncell,i,jVo,cell + Ncell,i,jV2WT(\nNcell,i,j + kv,cell\n)\nVo,cell + VMWT\n(7)\nBy assuming the worst scenario in which the total volume\nof the transformers are equal (i.e. VMWT = Ncell,i,jV2WT ),\n(7) can be used to ﬁnd the upper and lower boundary of the\npower density ratio (ρAMTB/ρ2WT), as depicted in Figure 9.\nAs can be seen, the AMTB can be potentially advantageous\nwhen the volume of the insulated cell does not differ much\nfrom the other cells. In the practice, it means that the optimal\nset of topology, power semiconductors, and the number of cells\nshould be considered for ensuring the best power density and\nthen overcoming the high volume, due to the higher currents.\nC. Design Considerations of the Insulated Cell\nFrom Figure 9, it is noted that the performance of the\nAMTB topologies might be reduced when the number cells\nincrease and hence the insulated cell has to process more\npower.

As a result, this leads to a slight increment\nin the junction temperature (Tj) and allows for selecting\nsmaller semiconductor chip area (ASE ) or for maintaining\nhigh-efﬁciency and high-reliability. Furthermore, in order to\nassess the power losses on the MTB converters, the active\nbridges aforementioned (cf. Figure 10) are combined into both\narchitectures: SMTB and AMTB topologies (cf. Figure 3).\nThus, assuming that the switching losses PSw are neglected\n(PSw ≈0), once the converters present soft-switching (ZVS\nand ZCS), and they process equal power at the same voltage,\nthe relation between the conduction losses PCond for AMTB\nand SMTB topologies are expressed by (9) and depicted in\nFigure 11 (given that PCond ∝RDS(on) ∝I2\nrms).\nPCond,AMTB\nPCond,SMTB\n= kRonN2\ncells,i,j\n(\nNL,sym −1\nNL,asym −1\n)\n(9)\nWhereas, kRon is a scaling factor associated to the semi-\nconductor technology used to compose the insulated cell of\nthe AMTB topologies.

However, when\nkron is monotonically reduced, the performance of the adopted\npower device is signiﬁcantly improved (e.g. wide-band gap\ndevice with lower RDS(on)), so that 0 < kRon ≤1. Thus,\nas shown in Figure 11 (b), devices with lower RDS(on) can\nreduce the conduction losses and improve the performance\nof the AMTB topology. Therefore, an optimized design can\nbe carried out to ﬁnd the optimum architecture, number of\ncells, and power device, as presented in [17], [18].

Cost-Beneﬁt\nThanks to the core material (cf. Figure 5) and number of\ncells reduction, the MTB topologies, in particular those based\non the asymmetrical conﬁguration might be more advanta-\ngeous in terms of cost compared to the solution based on\nmultiple converters employing 2WT. Thus, with a reduction\nof the number of cells, the cost-beneﬁt can also be extended\nto the power semiconductor devices. In a ﬁrst analysis, the\ndevices used to compose the symmetrical architecture can be\nall associated in parallel at the insulated cell [cf. Figure 3 (b)]\nfor processing the same power (i.e. PDC,asym = PDC,sym).\nTherefore, it is clear that the reduced number of printed-\ncircuit boards and auxiliary circuits will lead to a cost-beneﬁt.\nHowever, to avoid parallelism of several switches in AMTB\ntopologies, power semiconductor devices with lower RDS(ON)\nare required to ensure nearly the same efﬁciency compared\nto the symmetrical one. Thus, a scaling law relating the on-\nresistance with the number of cells can be used to deﬁne the\nrequired RDS(ON) value for an asymmetrical architectures [cf.\n(10)] and then its total costs.\nRDS(ON),asym ≤(Ncells,pri)−1 ·RDS(ON),sym (10)\nWhere, RDS(ON),asym and RDS(ON),sym are the required on-\nresistance of the AMTB and SMTB topologies, respectively.\nThis scaling law considers that the conduction losses are\nproportional to the power processed by the cells and also on-\nresistance value (i.e. PCond ∝PDC ∝RDS(on)).\nAs a matter of comparison, the estimated cost of the MTB\ntopologies considering the power semiconductor devices can\nbe deﬁned in terms of the number of cells employed in both\nthe SMTB and AMTB DC-DC converters, as expressed by\n(11) and (12), respectively. Where (CSMTB ) and (CSMTB )\nare the estimated cost of both MTB topologies, NMOS is the\nnumber of devices in each cell [cf. Figure 10], and σMOS is\nthe cost of a single power semiconductor device.\nCSMTB = σMOS,sym(2Ncell,priNMOS) (11)\nCAMTB = σMOS,symNMOS\n(\nNcell,pri + σMOS,asym\nσMOS,sym\n)\n(12)\nFigure 13. Unit Price of the power semiconductor device in function of the on-\nresistance (RDS(ON)) and number of cells (Ncells,pri) considering 1.2 kV\nSiC MOSFETs in asymmetrical and symmetrical architecture. The analysis\nis performed considering a device with an on-resistance equal to 300 mΩ for\nthe symmetrical architecture, as reference (i.e. RDS(ON),sym = 300 mΩ).\nIn both cases, the cells are considered identical (i.e. the same\nnumber of devices per cell) with the exception of the insulated\ncell in the AMTB topologies that can present different power\nsemiconductors device to handle the higher current. Thus, the\ncost-beneﬁt will be only obtained by the AMTB topoplogies\nwhether the price of a single power device σMOS,asym respects\nthe condition (13).\nσMOS,asym\nσMOS,sym\n≤Ncell,pri (13)\nFrom the unit price of the MOSFETs in dependency of\non-resistance [cf. Figure 12 (a) and (b)], and by using its\nﬁtting function, the cost analysis among the both architecture\nis estimated for 1.2 kV SiC as a function of the number of\ncells (cf. Figure 13). Thus, in order to summarize the previous\nanalysis, Table III presents the total cost analysis between the\nSMTB and AMTB converters, taking into account the unit\nprices from Figure 13 for different number of cells. In this\nanalysis was considered that the cells are implemented by\nusing the same active bridge FB (cf. Figure 10), which has\nfour devices per cell, i.e. NMOS = 4.\nAs can be seen, although higher current rating devices (with\nlower on-resistance) are required to implement the insulated\ncell of the AMTB topologies, the increased price of the\nindividual device does not impact further the total cost. On the\ncontrary, even with the lower RDS(ON), it is possible to reduce\naround 15 % of the power semiconductor costs. Therefore,\ndepending on the design constraints and requirements, power\nsemiconductor devices with lower RDS(ON) can afford certain\ncost-beneﬁt in AMTB topologies, cf. [16], [18].\nIn this context, the higher current also affects the thickness\nof the cooper wires of MWT, enlarging its cross-section\narea. However, the cooper cost to build either symmetrical\nMWT (even multiples 2WT) or an asymmetrical MWT can\nbe assumed equal at the same power level. In other words,\nthe thick cooper wire used in the asymmetrical MWT can be\nconsidered as the union of the all individual windings in only\none, cf. Figure 5 (c). Apart of that, it should be noted that\nthe cooper cost (CCu) is proportional to power processed by\nthe winding (Sw = vrmsirms).

Multiwinding Fault-tolerant Capability\nAnother advantage and potential of the MWT is related\nto the redundant power path, which provides fault-tolerant\ncapability by means of the magnetic coupling among the\ncells. As the cells are connected to the same core, in case\nof a fault, the faulty cell can be isolated from the converter\nand then the power ﬂow can be routed among the healthy\ncells. Accordingly, the operation is kept without affecting the\navailability and the maintenance costs due to some interruption\nof the operation.\nThe proposed fault-tolerant approach aims at the realization\nof a topology with particular attention to the continuous\noperation of the system, even under faulty conditions. For\nthat reason, the fault-tolerant scheme is composed by isolation\nswitches (i.e. bidirectional arrangement of power semiconduc-\ntors), which acts directly on the cells, disconnecting them in\ncase of fault. Similarly, the same switches can be used to\nreconnect the cell in order to restore the thorough operation.\nFigure 15. (a) Hardware prototype of the SQAB converter. (b) Power ﬂow\non the SQAB considering a fault at the cell 2.\nIn Figure 14, the main cells of the power converter are at\nthe same time the redundant parts that are operating in power-\nsharing mode. In normal conditions, all cells of the converter\noperate simultaneously, sharing the power among the cells. In\ncase of a fault, only the faulty cell is isolated from the entire\nsystem [cf Figure 14], whereas the healthy cells maintain the\npower ﬂow and the system operating. Moreover, the converter\ncan also be designed considering extra windings, so that stand-\nby cell might be integrated to the system. Both approaches are\nequally feasible, the implementation will depend only on the\ndesign requirements and constraints from each application.\nIn order to verify the performance of the proposed fault-\ntolerant approach based on the MWT, a prototype of a sym-\nmetrical QAB (SQAB) converter was built and experimental\nresults were obtained, cf. Figure 15 (a). The converter operates\nin open-loop and the gating signals are generated by the digital\nsignal processor (DSP). To evaluate dynamically the perfor-\nmance of the converter under fault case [cf. Figure 15 (b)],\na short-circuit on the cell 2 was emulated by software in the\nDSP (TMS320F28379D), as investigated in [49].\nFigure 16 presents the main waveforms of the SQAB\nconverter operating dynamically before and after a fault at\nthe cell 2 (cf. Figure 16). The dynamic behavior during the\nfault at the cell 2 is depicted in Figure 16 (a), demonstrating\nthat the converter maintains operational after the failure and\nthe immediate disconnection of the faulty cell (through the\nisolation-switch), cf.

Figure 16 (c).\nAfter the fault, the system veriﬁes if the fault was cleared and\nthen if the isolated-cell remains healthy to be reconnected to\nthe converter, cf. Figure 16 (d). Otherwise, it is reconﬁgured to\npartial load mode: the faulty cell remains disconnected and the\npower ﬂow is adjusted for the resulting topology (i.e. TAB).\nF . Reliability and Availability Assessment\nAs the MTB topologies are composed of several cells, the\ntotal number of employed components is increased compared\nto an equivalent single converter system. In effect, this in-\ncreases the probability of a failure of a component or cell [50]–\n[53]). However, in contrast to the single converter system, the\nfailure of a single component does not necessarily conduct to a\nfailure of the whole converter, since only one cell is affected.\nAs previously shown, depending on the architecture of the\nconverter and the failure, it can still be functional in partial\npower ﬂow. Thus, minimizing the failure of those elements\nand mainly their impact, the overall reliability (Rsyst) and\navailability (Asyst) can be enhanced, cf. (14) and (15).\nRsyst(t) = Rsyst(0) ·e\n−\n∫ t\n0\nλsyst(τ)dτ\n(14)\nIn (14), Rsyst(t) is the reliability function; Rsyst(0) is the\ninitial reliability of the system, i.e. when Rsyst(0) = 1, the\nsystem is fully functional at initial state; λsyst(t) is the failure\nrate, which indicates the number of failures per unit time (i.e.\none failure in the time: 1 FIT = 10−9 failure/hour).\nAsyst = MTTF\nMTTF + MTTR (15)\nWhereas in (15), MTTF is the expected time before a\nfailure occurs and MTTR is the mean repair time that it takes\nto eliminate a failure and to restore the system operation.\nThe repair time depends on maintainability, such as effective\ndiagnosis of faults, operational time to replace the faulty cell\nand so on. In contrast to reliability, MTTF provides only the\naverage time that the system operates without failing. The\nrelation between MTTF and Rsyst(t) is deﬁned by (16), when\nλsyst(t) is constant (i.e. λsyst(t) = λsyst) [54]–[56].\nMTTFsyst =\n∫ +∞\n0\nRsyst(τ)dτ = 1\nλsyst\n(16)\nSince the failure rates of the reactive network along with\nMWT are much lower than those of semiconductors and DC-\nLink capacitors, their failures are neglected [53], and any fault\nin the capacitors and semiconductors might lead the cell to\nfail. As a matter of fact, it is assumed that the system is\nnon-repairable, and it is capable of fault detection, isolation,\nand reconﬁguration, i.e., the system has an effective fault\nmanagement [49]. Moreover, considering that the all cells are\nequal and the failure rate of each cell λcell are constants,\nthe mean time to failure (MTTF syst) for the entire system\nwith Ncells in symmetrical and asymmetrical conﬁguration (cf.\nFigure 3) can be estimated by (17) and (18), respectively.\nMTTFsyst,sym = 1\n2Ncellsλcell\n(17)\nMTTFsyst,asym = 1(\nNcells + kfail\n)\nλcell\n(18)\nIn that case, λcell is deﬁned by: λcell = λCap +λSw, so that\nλCap = (∑\nk λCap,k) and λSw = (∑\nk λSw,k ) are the failure\nof the all capacitors and power devices employed int the cell,\nrespectively; and kfail is the failure factor, which indicated\nthe relation between λcell from the symmetrical conﬁguration\nwith failure ratio of the insulated cell λicell from the AMTB\ntopologies, so that kfail = (λicell/λcell) ≥1. In other words,\ndue to the fact the total power in an AMTB converter is\nmerged and processed by only this insulated cell, the current\nefforts are higher and thus its failure rate might also be higher\n(λicell ≥ λcell), i.e. λicell ∝kfail ∝Nf , according to (19).\nNf = k1(∆Tj)k2 ·\n[\ne−k3\n(\nTj,av+273 ◦C\n)]\n(19)\nWhereas Nf is the number of thermal cycles to failure; ∆Tj\nis the magnitude of the thermal variation; Tj,av is the average\njunction temperature during this variation; and k1, k2, and k3\nare ﬁtting parameters [48], [52], [57], [58].\nComparatively, from a system-level perspective, the MTTF\nof a system composed by multiple 2WT-based converters\n(MTTFsyst,2WT) can be easily obtained from (17). In that\ncase, even when only one single cell fails, in fact, two cells\nare removed of the power ﬂow, since the multiples DC-\nDC converter based on 2WT are not coupled magnetically\namong them. Hence, MTTFsyst,2WT = (MTTFsyst,sym/2),\nas expressed in (20) and illustrated in Figure 17.\nMTTFsyst,2WT = 1\n2Ncellsλcell,2WT\n= 1\n4Ncellsλcell\n(20)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universitat Kiel.

Failure behavior of the asymmetrical and symmetrical conﬁgura-\ntion based on the MWT and 2WT, considering the number of cells employed\nin each architecture and also the different failure rates of the insulated cell.\nAs can be seen, for λicell = λcell, the asymmetrical conﬁg-\nuration exhibits a higher MTTF compared to the symmetrical\nconﬁguration using MWT and 2WT, due to the reduced\nnumber of components. However, as long as λicell rises toward\nto an elevated failure rate in order to access fairly the MTB\ntopologies (e.g. kfail = 20 and hence λicell = 20λcell), the\nMTTFsyst,asym reduces in accordance with (18). However,\neven for failure rate ten times higher (kfail = 10), which is\nquite signiﬁcant, the asymmetrical conﬁguration still shows\nsome advantage. Therefore, based on the MTTF, the overall\nAMTB topologies might has superior performance compared\nto the other two architectures, providing a elevated lifetime\nbefore some failure.\nNevertheless, the MTTF neglects the consequences on the\noperation whether a fault occurs at the insulated cell. In that\ncase, a failure in this cell can interrupt abruptly the power\nﬂow, since it is completely merged in a single power path\nthrough the insulated winding of the MWT (secondary side,\ncf. Figure 3). As a result, even with a considerable MTTF,\nthe particular case where the AMTB topology is composed of\nonly an insulated cell can experience a blackout, reducing the\navailability by increasing the mean time to repair (i.e. MTTR).\nIn this scenario, one possible solution to ensure the availability,\nand thus the continuous operation of the AMTB topologies, is\nperformed by adding stand-by redundant cells along with the\ninsulated cell, so that (18) can be rewritten as (21).\nMTTFsyst,asym = 1 + Nred,stb\n(\nNcells + kfail\n)\nλcell\n(21)\nThe addition of Nred,stb stand-by redundant cells allows to\nachieve a redundancy, where the system is operational as long\nas Ncells cells are functional out of total cells (i.e. Ncells +\nNred,stb). Although the initial cost to insert these redundant\ncell is a part of the whole system (depending on the total\nnumber of cells), this cost tends to become high over time,\nsince the cells are not providing any service to the system.\nTherefore, from the continuous operation point of view, the\narchitecture considering at least two cells are recommended\n(Ncells,i,j ≥2), once the MWT fault-tolerant capability can\nbe used to overcome possible interruptions and to mitigate the\nmaintenance efforts.\nG. Challenges of MWT in MTB Topologies\nThe advantages of the common magnetic core come at the\nexpense of speciﬁc challenges related to the operation of MTB\nTopologies (cf. Figure 18). The majority of MWT topologies\nare based on non-resonant operation mode. Although reso-\nnant converters are known for its advantageous characteristics\nlike high-efﬁcient and soft-switching operation across a wide\nload range, only a few works have been done on the topic\nof resonant MTB topologies. In particular, the predominant\nreason is the complex frequency modulation of the coupled\nports. Furthermore, limiting factors arise from the practical\nrequirement for splitting the resonant tank on the different\nreactive networks. In most publications the resonant tank\nelements are located in the reactive network of each module in\norder to allow equal conditions for bidirectional power ﬂow\n[37] [42]. Moreover, due to the complex transfer functions,\nthe desired power sharing of the ports is challenging. In [38],\nit was shown that the power sharing between the ports can\nbe achieved with a speciﬁc ratio of resonant inductances.\nHowever, the MTB topologies based on LLC converter is\ndesigned with equal resonance frequency and operate with a\nﬁxed frequency and duty cycle. Therefore, the only degree of\nfreedom to adjust the power ﬂow of each cell is made by the\nDC input voltages, which requires another conversion stage\nfor the DC voltage adaption, as presented in [38].\nMoreover, the higher complexity in the transformer design\nmakes the MWT topologies more susceptible to deviations\nof the stray elements of the MWT. Deviations in the stray\nelements can lead to unequal power transfers among the cells.\nThe issue of unwanted couplings between load ports can occur\ndue to load changes in one output port. Although the cells\nare isolated from each other, through the common magnetic\ncore, the load change of one port will affect the other cells. In\nparticular, the effects of parameter deviations and unwanted\ncouplings depend heavily on the conﬁguration of how the\ncells are interconnected. Thus, the next section provides an\noverview about different interconnections, the resulting effects\nof the MWT issues related to different interconnection possi-\nbilities and measures how to mitigate these effects.\nIV. I NTERCONNECTION AND OPERATION MODES ISSUES\nIN MTB DC-DC C ONVERTERS\n1) Module Interconnection: With respect to the intercon-\nnection between the terminal ports, the cells can be intercon-\nnected in one of the conﬁgurations listed in Table IV (cf.\nFigure 19) [46], [59]. As can be seen, there are basically\nthree possible connections: series, parallel and independent;\nFigure 18.

Possible conﬁgurations used to interconnect the modules in the MTB topology: (a) input-series output-series (ISOS); (b) input-series output-parallel\n(ISOP) or input-parallel output-series (IPOS); (c) input-parallel output-parallel (IPOP); (d) input-independent output-independent (IIOI); (e) input-independent\noutput-series (IIOS) or input-series output-independent (ISOI); input-independent output-parallel (IIOP) and input-parallel output-independent (IPOI).\nwhich can be mixed among them in order to reach the prop-\nerly conﬁguration depending on the application requirement.\nMoreover, these different interconnections allow to either\nshare the current between the converter modules with parallel\ninterconnection or distribute the voltage between the converter\ncells with series interconnection. For the case of isolated\nsources or loads, the cells are kept separated, so that each\ncell is connected directly to one of these isolated sources or\nloads. Therefore, regardless the architecture conﬁguration and\nsymmetry, the cells can have different voltage/current levels\nand at same time they can share power among them indepen-\ndently from the others. It means that the MTB topologies can\nhave several conﬁgurations, making its applicability extremely\nwide and suitable for all power, voltage and current levels.\nA. Deviations in the Stray Components of the MWT\nThe increased number of windings might lead to a more\ncomplex MWT design. Thereby, one important parameter is\nthe leakage inductance of each winding which contributes\nto the inductance of the reactive network. Depending on\nthe arrangement of the windings, the value of the leakage\ninductance in each winding might differ. In MAB converters\n[cf. Figure 20 (a)], this inductance is a key parameter which\ndeﬁnes the power transfer of the related port. A port with\na smaller inductance will transfer more power compared to\na port with a higher one [cf. Figure 20 (b)-(c) and (f)-(g)].\nThus, depending on the module interconnection, an unequal\nand undesirable power ﬂow is created among the cells.\nIn particular, the independent connection will lead to large\ndeviations on the current due to the resulting output-voltage\nimbalance, cf. Figure 20 (g). Thus, in order to balance\nthe power ﬂow, the phase-shifts among the ports have to\nbe adapted. However, this might lead to higher circulating\ncurrents. Therefore, to avoid the unequal power transfer char-\nacteristic, without adapting the phase-shift, is used different\nextra inductances in the reactive network. Hence, the total in-\nductance in the reactive network can be equalized in each port.\nFor the resonant operation mode, deviations in the reactive\nnetwork will lead to different characteristics of the resonant\ntank and hence to different power transfer characteristics, cf.\nFigure 20 (d)-(e) and (h)-(i). Thus, the parameters in the\nresonant tank need to be adjusted in order to balance the power\nﬂow, so that these issues show the importance of the MWT\ndesign for the MTB converters. Especially the avoidance of\ndeviations in the leakage inductance of the individual windings\nis of particular importance.\nB. Unwanted cross-coupling Effects\nThe issue of unwanted cross-coupling effects describes the\ninteraction between load ports due to the magnetic coupling.\nIn other words, when the output characteristic of one port\nis changed, the other ports will also be affected [25]. This\neffect is severe for architectures with independent load ports\n(ISOI, IPOI, IIOI), especially for operation modes with large\ndifference in power/voltage level.\nFor instance, in a MAB topology a load step in one of\nthe load ports will require an increase in phase-shift of the\nrelated output port. However, due to the magnetic coupling,\nthe power transfer of the other load ports will be affected and\na readjusting of their phase-shifts is required. As a result, the\nreadjusting of the phase-shifts leads to a relative phase-shift\nand hence to higher circulating currents in the converter.\nIn literature, the problem of cross-coupling in MAB convert-\ners is mainly addressed with strategies which allows individual\ncontrol of the load ports [27] [60]. In general, the existing con-\ntrol concepts for MTB converters pursue the target to simplify\nthe control structure to multiple independent control loops with\nsingle input single output characteristic, like in conventional\n2WT-based converter. However, the physical effects of the\ncross-coupling are still present so that the circulating power\nis not fully eliminated. Another way to decouple the output\nports can be realized with a speciﬁc inductance ratio between\nthe feeding (L Feed,i ) and the sinking ports ( LSink,j ) [28].\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universitat Kiel.

Whereas (a)-(b) are decoupled and (c)-(d) are not decoupled.\nFigure 21 shows the relation between the choice of the reactive\nnetwork inductance and the decoupling of the output ports. In\nthis scenario, the power of one load port is increased two times\nthe power of the other output ports.\nFurther, for the independent load case, the related output\nvoltage VDC,1 is assumed to be higher. Figure 21 (a)-(c)\nshow the system with a common DC-link at the output ports\n(i.e. parallel interconnection). The choice of the inductance\nratio only inﬂuences slightly the current waveforms. For\nindependent load ports, the choice of the inductance ratio\nsigniﬁcantly affects the coupling [cf. Figure 21 (b),(d)]. The\nresulting distortion in the current and the higher peak currents\ndeteriorates the efﬁciency for cases with a low ratio of\n(LSink,j /LFeed,i ) which results in a strongly coupled system\n[cf. Figure 21 (f)]. Whereas, for conﬁgurations with a common\nDC-link at the output (parallel conﬁguration), the degree\nof decoupling has only limited inﬂuence on the converter\nefﬁciency [cf. Figure 21 (e)].\nThe inﬂuence of the inductance ratio on the cross-coupling\nfor independent load ports has been experimentally validated\n(cf. Figure 22) in a TAB converter, considering two load\nports. Thus, for an inductance ratio of (LSink,j /LFeed,i ) = 1,\nthe output voltage is changed by 10 % of the rated voltage\non port 2. This leads to a large change in the transformer\ncurrent (iSink,1) of the unchanged load port 1, increasing\nthe current effort on the devices. For the decoupled ports\nwith an inductance ratio of (LSink,j /LFeed,i ) = 5 , a load\nchange at port 2 does not impact on the power transfer\ncharacteristic of port 1. The current iSink,1 of the unchanged\nport stays nearly constant after the voltage-step in port 2. To\nachieve the desired inductance ratio, extra inductances can be\nplaced in the load ports. However, increasing this inductance\nin a MAB conﬁguration might lead to higher circulating\ncurrent [17]. Thus, there is a trade-off between the decoupled\nports and total inductance, which can be achieved by some\nwinding arrangements.\nC. Maximum Number of Windings in a MWT\nFurther, the size constraints of the MWT needs to be\nconsidered. The larger the number of windings, the larger\nwill be the required window area of the magnetic core.\nThus, the maximum available number of windings is limited\nby the commercial off-the-shelf available magnetic cores, as\nillustrated in Figure 23. Theoretically, custom made larger\nmagnetic cores could be used but this option is not considered,\ndue to the higher expected costs. The resulting requirements\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universitat Kiel. Downloaded on May 31,2021 at 15:05:49 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n0885-8993 (c) 2021 IEEE.

The required area product\nis compared with available cores from different manufactures.\nThus, Figure 23 summarizes the limitations in terms of\nmaximum number of windings with respect to different power\nlevels per winding. Considering the largest available core core\nU126/91/20 (UU cores) from magnetics with the product area\n(Ap = 572 cm4), the power processed by the MWT is limited\nto PMWT = 143 kW, so that the power can be divided among\nthe windings. For conﬁgurations with less number of windings\nand lower power, the usage of E-cores (e.g. planar cores) can\nbe a good option [61]. Yet, it should be noted that theoretically\nthe window area of the core can be increased further by\ninserting an I-core between the two outer cores (i.e. UIIU).\nD. Typical Winding Arrangement of MWT\nThe previous considerations revealed the importance of\na proper winding arrangement in MWT. Depending on the\napplication ﬁeld and the module interconnection, the optimum\nFigure 24. Possible winding structures for MWT considering E-cores: (a)\nLayered structure; (b) Stacked structure; and (c) Interleaved stacked structure.\nConsidering U-cores: (d) Layered structure; (e) Stacked structure; and (f)\nInterconnected-leg stacked structure.\nwinding structure might differ. In general, existing winding\nstructures for conventional 2WT can be extended to MWT,\nwhich is shown for a kth winding transformer in shell-type\nand core-type winding arrangement (cf. Figure 24). However,\nsome winding structures might not be beneﬁcial to be used in\nMWT. For instance, a layered (concentric) winding structure\n[cf. Figure 24 (a) and (d)], leads to large unbalances in the\nleakage inductances of the ports due to the different distances\nbetween the windings. Furthermore, stacked (also referred to\nsectioned [17]) winding structures depict another solution,\ncf. Figure 24 (b) and (e), for EE and UU conﬁguration,\nrespectively. On the other hand, interleaved stacked winding\nstructures further improve the coupling among the windings,\ncf. Figure 24 (c). As an additional winding arrangement\nfor core-type MWT, the interconnected-leg stacked structure\narise to further reduce deviations in the leakage inductance\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universitat Kiel.

Figure 24 (f). Thus, these basic structures\ncan be combined in order to achieve the desired transfer\ncharacteristic with respect to different module interconnection\nconﬁgurations, as shown in Figure 19. For example an ISOI\nmodule interconnection with individual load ports requires\na high impedance between the load ports in order to limit\nthe undesired cross-coupling effects. At the same time the\ncoupling between the feeding- and sinking ports should be\nas high as possible. Therefore interleaved stacked winding\nstructures might be more advantageous.\nV. Q UANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE MTB DC-DC\nCONVERTERS\nDifferent conﬁgurations of the MTB DC-DC converters and\nsome of their possible topologies based on DAB, SR and LLC\nwere presented in Section II. In order to verify quantitatively\nthe converters performance in terms of efﬁciency, losses and\npower density, some topologies were simulated using the\nMATLAB/Simulink and the PLECS toolbox, considering the\nelectrical speciﬁcations described in Table V and also the\nTable V\nELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS OF THE MTB DC-DC C ONVERTER .\nTotal Power Switching Frequency DC-Link V oltage\nPMTB = 10 kW fsw = 20 kHz VDC,i,j = 400 V\nFigure 25.

Quantitative Analysis of the MTB topologies in terms of total\npower losses on the cells (conduction and switching losses) and MWT (ohmic\nlosses), considering the base value equal to 150 W.\nparameters presented in Table VI. For the MWT, it was\nassumed the same magnetic core (E80/38/20) and the same\nwires on the primary-side windings for all topologies. The\ndifference of the MWT among the evaluated MTB topologies\nremains on the winding arrangements and on the wires of the\ninsulated winding, which is obtained by the association of all\nsecondary-side wires in parallel, as discussed in Section III.\nIn total, there are nine converters, where three of them\nare non-resonant and the other six are resonant, as listed in\nTable VII. Among the non-resonant, it was evaluated the TAB,\nsymmetric QAB (SQAB) and asymmetric QAB (AQAB),\nconsidering the active cell FB as the building-block. For the\nresonant converters, it was adopted similar architecture in\norder to perform a fair analysis among the MTB topologies.\nTherefore, it was evaluated the three-port SR (3P-SR), sym-\nmetric four-port SR (4P-SSR) and asymmetric four-port SR\n(4P-ASR) converters. Yet, for the resonant converters, due to\ntheir inherent operation characteristics, the bidirectional and\nunidirectional versions were also considered. In the ﬁrst case,\nit was used only the active cell FB (based on SiC MOSFETs,\ncf. Table VI) to implemented the converters, whereas in the\nsecond case, the passive cell FWR (based on SiC schottky\ndiodes) was adopted in the secondary-side cell.\nIn principle, the same cell might be used as the building\nblock of the non-resonant and resonant converters aforemen-\ntioned, taking into account the same power rating.

As a result, the building-block of the\nresonant converters are slightly longer than the non-resonant\nones, as depicted in Figure 25.\nHence, the results from the quantitative analysis are pre-\nsented in Table VII and Figure 26. Table VII summarizes the\nefﬁciency and power density results, while Figure 26 shows the\nlosses distribution on each investigated MTB topologies. As\ncan be seen, the designed AMTB converters exhibit an superior\nperformance when compared to the symmetrical ones, since\nthe power density is increased without deteriorating the overall\nefﬁciency. This is achieved by using the proper selection of\nthe power semiconductors, as discussed in Section III. In\nrelation to the operation mode, both non-resonant and resonant\ntopologies present in general a similar performance from the\nefﬁciency and power losses perspective. However, regarding\nthe power density, the resonant topologies can be slightly\nimpacted due to the resonant capacitor, which can increase\nthe volume of their cells, as demonstrated in Table VII.\nFinally, the unidirectional resonant MTB converters provide\nthe best efﬁciency, since the SiC schottky diodes behaves\nbetter than the body-diode of the SiC MOSFET. In this\napplication, due to elevated current on the secondary and a\ndirect power ﬂow (i.e. primary-side to secondary-side cells),\nthe current ﬂows simultaneously through the main channel\nand body-diode of the SiC MOSFETs, so that the conduction\nlosses is highly affected by the forward drop voltage. Conse-\nquently, the diode losses on the SiC MOSFET became relevant\nand should be carefully considered during the selection of the\npower semiconductor devices.\nVI. C ONCLUSIONS\nThe MTB topologies are a promising choice for implement-\ning the isolated DC-DC converters, because they have high\nperformance and economic advantages. In comparison to the\nmodular architectures based on the 2WT, the MTB topologies\ncan reduce the required core material around 10 %, when the\nMWT is adopted. As a result, this leads to a cost- and size-\nreduction. Additionally, the usage of AMTB topologies, where\nmultiples cells are placed at the primary side and only one\nat the secondary side, can further decrease the number of\ncells and consequently enhance the power density. Therefore,\nadopting the MTB topologies instead of the conventional 2WT-\nbased topologies (e.g. multiple DAB and SR converters), the\npower density can be enlarged by 30 % and the semiconductor\ndevice’s cost at least by 15%.\nFrom the availability perspective, the MTB topologies arise\nwith another potential regarding the inherent fault-tolerant ca-\npability, which ensures the continuous operation of the system.\nThus, in MTB DC-DC converter there are multiple power\npaths where the processed power can be easily routed the\npower among the cells, since they are magnetically coupled.\nFurthermore, since the main cells of the power converter are at\nthe same time the redundant parts that are operating in power-\nsharing mode, the MWT allows also a cost-reduction avoiding\nthe classic hardware redundancy (extra stand-by cells).\nIn several application ﬁelds, such as EVs, fast charger\nstation, uninterruptible power supply system (UPS), special\nmedicine equipment, more-electric-aircraft (MEA), data pro-\ncessing (and data center), hybrid grids, solid-state transformer\n(SST) and others; contain at least one DC-DC converter\nfor adapting the voltage and/or control the power processed.\nThus, each application imposes different requirements in terms\ncost, power density, efﬁciency and reliability. However, these\nrequirements together are conﬂicting, since the reliability and\nefﬁciency can affect directly the cost. Whereas the efﬁciency\nis related to the energy saving and a reliable converter to the\nmaintenance cost, the ﬁnal cost can be also reduced. Therefore,\nfor each application ﬁeld, one requirement is more critical than\nthe others, which deserves more attention.\nIn critical application ﬁelds with respect to the availability\n(e.g SST, data center and MEA), the symmetric conﬁguration\nleads to higher fault-tolerant capability, when compared to\nthe asymmetrical, since the insulated cell can interrupt the\npower ﬂow when fails. In cost constraint designs, the use\nof asymmetric MTB architectures has advantages compared\nto conventional modular two-winding architectures, as the\nasymmetrical MAB in DC-DC stage of SST applications [18].\nFor high efﬁciency applications, the use of non-resonant and\nresonant MTB DC-DC topologies provide a beneﬁcial trade-\noff between cost and efﬁciency when used in asymmetrical\nconﬁguration. The efﬁciency of resonant and non-resonant\nMTB topologies are very similar, only a slight improvement\ncan be obtained in the resonant ones due to the soft-switching\nwide-range operation [16], [17]. Besides cost and efﬁciency,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universitat Kiel. Downloaded on May 31,2021 at 15:05:49 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n0885-8993 (c) 2021 IEEE.

Based\non these information, a classiﬁcation and overview of the\nMTB topologies were done over the paper, highlighting their\nadvantages compared to 2WT. Regarding, the fault-tolerant\ncapability, the MTB DC-DC converter has been presented\nand evaluated experimentally to validate the multiwinding\nredundancy approach. As can be seen, the main advantages\nof the introduced approach are post-fault operation, simple\nimplementation, reduced number of additional components,\nand no signiﬁcant efﬁciency deterioration.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by the German Federal Ministry\nfor Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) within Project\nKielFlex Kiel als Vorbild f ¨ur die Errichtung von Ladein-\nfrastruktur in einem ﬂexiblen Stromnetz zur Umsetzung einer\nEmissionsreduktion im Transportsektor (01MZ18002D) and\nalso BAEW-project funded by the WTSH and the EKSH of\nSchleswig-Holstein (LPW-E/1.1.2/1486).\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
