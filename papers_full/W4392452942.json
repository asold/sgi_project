    "abstract": "Background: Academic writing is an essential component of research, characterized by structured expression of ideas, data-driven arguments, and logical reasoning. However, it poses challenges such as handling vast amounts of information and complex ideas. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into academic writing has become increasingly important, offering solutions to these challenges. This review aims to explore specific domains where AI significantly supports academic writing. Methods: A systematic review of literature from databases like PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, published since 2019, was conducted. Studies were included based on relevance to AI's application in academic writing and research, focusing on writing assistance, grammar improvement, structure optimization, and other related aspects. Results: The search identified 24 studies through which six core domains were identified where AI helps academic writing and research: 1) facilitating idea generation and research design, 2) improving content and structuring, 3) supporting literature review and synthesis, 4) enhancing data management and analysis, 5) supporting editing, review, and publishing, and 6) assisting in communication, outreach, and ethical compliance. ChatGPT has shown substantial potential in these areas, though challenges like maintaining academic integrity and balancing AI use with human insight remain. Conclusion and recommendations: AI significantly revolutionises academic writing and research across various domains. Recommendations include broader integration of AI tools in research workflows, emphasizing ethical and transparent use, providing adequate training for researchers, and maintaining a balance between AI utility and human insight. Ongoing research and development are essential to address emerging challenges and ethical considerations in AI's application in academia.",
