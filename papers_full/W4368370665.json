  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence with their ability to understand and generate natural language discourse. This has led to the use of LLMs in various creative fields such as music, art, and storytelling, which has sparked a debate on the impact of LLMs on human creativity. This article explores the cyclic effect of LLMs on human creativity, where LLMs can generate an ever-evolving cycle of creative output from both humans and machines. The article also highlights the importance of responsible and ethical use of LLMs, including privacy and copyright issues with the training data used by LLMs. The article emphasizes the need for transparency, data security measures, and AI governance policies to protect user data and ensure the safe use of LLMs. It also calls for the development of educational materials and resources to increase public understanding of LLMs and their ethical implications. The article concludes by highlighting the potential of LLMs as powerful tools for communication and education, but also emphasizes the need for ethical considerations to ensure the responsible and beneficial use of LLMs in society.",
