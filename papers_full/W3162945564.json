INTRODUCTION\nThe power transformers are the utmost fundamental part of\nthe power system utilities [1]. The performance and con-\nstancy of the power system utilities are directly dependent on\nthe power transformer [2]. Therefore, its health is essential for\nthe power system’s stability and reliability. Any failure may\nresult in high capital loss with disruption of power supply [3].\nThe power transformers are exposed to different stress con-\nditions in the form of electrical, mechanical, environmental,\nand thermal stress. These stresses are potential sources for\ndifferent internal and external faults in the power transformer.\nThe majority of these faults occur due to the impending\ndeterioration of the insulation system [2]. To avoid the electric\nsupply disruption, condition monitoring is performed. Mon-\nitoring is a form of predictive maintenance that determines\nthe operating state and the assessment of the functionality of\nthe power transformer. This helps in preventing possible fail-\nures by taking early action through scheduling maintenance\ntasks [4].\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Giambattista Gruosso\n.\nThe power transformer during the stage of operation may\nundergo various types of faults with different levels of\nseverity [5]. Therefore, proper examination for detecting\nthe transformer’s health level is essential for the continuous\noperation of the electrical utilities. The condition monitoring\nsystems of a power transformer can be classiﬁed into two\nmain categories; online and ofﬂine. The online condition\nmonitoring methods are preferred over ofﬂine methods even\nthough the reliability of ofﬂine testing is higher [2]. Ofﬂine\ncondition monitoring methods are usually performed during\nthe manufacturing phase of the power transformer to examine\nthe manufacturing defects, which are present in the form\nof voids, cracks, and bubbles in the insulation [6]. Ofﬂine\ntesting methods include advanced electrical measurements,\nwhich are efﬁcient enough to examine the PD activities.\nHowever, ofﬂine monitoring lacks the actual electrical and\nthermal conditions of the insulations that are different during\nthe operating phase of the transformer [7].\nThe power transformer is a complex structure experienc-\ning faults, which are categorized into internal and external\nfaults. Fig. 1 shows the classiﬁcation of fault in the power\ntransformer [8]. Global statistics show that 70% - 80% of\nVOLUME 9, 2021 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Classification of fault in power transformer.\ntransformer’s faults are internal faults [9]. The initiation\nof internal fault starts with the trivial discharge inside the\ntransformer insulation, which is a transient state. Further,\nthe trivial value of the discharge in the insulation can grow\nrapidly and lead to a complete breakdown. Internal faults\narise due to fault in different areas which include the wind-\ning (axial displacement, buckling deformation, disc space\nvariation, and short circuit turns) [10], tank, insulating oil\n(oxidation, water penetration, dissolution due to temperature\nrise, and acidity) [11], core (core insulation failure, shorted\nlamination) [12], terminal (open leads, loose connections,\nshort circuits) [13], cooling system, and tap changer (mechan-\nical, electrical, short circuit, overheating) [14]. External\nfaults occur due to several reasons including the external\nshort-circuit of the power system, overﬂux, and overload.\nFig. 2 shows different areas of fault location for transformer\nwhich are located in the substation (> 100 kV) [15].\nFIGURE 2. Transformer failure for transformer at substation\n(>100 kV) [15].\nThe power transformer fault detection and condition mon-\nitoring are crucial to increase the electric system reliability.\nSeveral common online condition monitoring techniques are\nused. These include dissolved gas analysis (DGA) [16], [17],\npartial discharge measurement [18], power factor measure-\nment [19], frequency response analysis (FRA) [11], vibra-\ntion and acoustic analysis [20], dielectric spectroscopy [21],\ndifferential protection [22], transformation ratio [23], and\ninsulation resistance [24]. Among these techniques, partial\ndischarge monitoring can effectively diagnose the trans-\nformer’s condition with the possibility of advancement in the\nfuture.\nPD is contemplated as the root cause of the insula-\ntion degradation where a complete breakdown can lead to\ntransformer failure [25], [26]. Different PD analysis tech-\nniques for condition monitoring are performed for PD detec-\ntion, identiﬁcation, and diagnosis [27]. Several techniques\nwere developed to detect PD including electrical detec-\ntion [28]–[32], electromagnetic detection [26], [33]–[37],\noptical detection [38]–[40], acoustic detection [41]–[45], gas\npresence detection [16], [46]–[48], and combinational meth-\nods [41], [49], [50]. PD sources signals are received through\na detector and are further analyzed to identify the locations\nand severity of insulation defects. The complex geometry\nof power transformers with different noise sources becomes\nquite challenging to identify the severity of PD defects and\nlocalization. The external noises are in the form of natu-\nral sources such as electrical storms, electrostatic interfer-\nence, electromagnetic interference (through current cables),\nradiofrequency interference (from radio signals), and cross\ntalk (cables separated by small distance). Whereas, the inter-\nnal noises are mainly caused by the vibrations of the trans-\nformer core and windings. The PD detection system is desired\nto precisely identify the severity and locate the defects.\nThe detection system process includes the denoising pro-\ncess of PD activity, feature extraction, PD classiﬁcation, and\nPD clustering methods.\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n• A brief description of the power transformer, its\nadvances, and design for the improved insulation.\n• Review of state-of-the-art techniques of power trans-\nformer faults, with a focus on various power transformer\nPD forms types, detection, and measurement in power\ntransformer during the operating state.\n• A comprehensive insight into various PD diagnostics\ntechniques for different types of defects in power trans-\nformer during operation.\n• Further, the common techniques for denoising, feature\nextraction, classiﬁcation, clustering of PD data for local-\nization, and severity of PD source with current advance-\nment have been discussed.\nThe paper is organized as follows.

Section IV gives the\nmost efﬁcient PD diagnostics techniques used in the power\ntransformer. The information regarding different denoising\ntechniques is discussed in Section V . PD feature extraction,\nPD classiﬁcation, and PD clustering are comprehensively\ndiscussed in Section VI, VII, and VIII, respectively. Finally,\nsection IX concludes the paper.\nII. PARTIAL DISCHARGE IN POWER TRANSFORMERS\nPD is the electrical breakdown in the insulation that does\nnot completely bridge the electrodes resulting in localized\nelectric stress. This process is a slow insulation degradation\nand reducing the insulation life of the power transformer [51].\nPD arises when there is a higher electric ﬁeld than the thresh-\nold value causing a partial breakdown of the surrounding\n64588 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Overview and PD Analysis of Power Transformers: A Literature Review\nmedium [52]. The transient behavior of the PD has the prop-\nerty of pulsating currents of duration between nanoseconds to\nmicroseconds [53]. PD discharge level cannot always justify\nthe severity due to the possibility of rapid treeing phenomena.\nIn general, the complete breakdown destroys the insulator,\nwhich does not retain any information regarding PD type [53].\nTherefore, it requires continuous monitoring to resolve the\nissues in the early stage [54], [55]. Each type of defect has its\ndistinguished degradation properties whose PD pattern can be\nused to ﬁgure out the insulation condition [56].\nPD phenomenon has a stochastic behavior due to the\nunpredictable nature of pulsating PD occurrences. Some steps\nof the PD phenomenon can be predicted statistically, but not\naccurately due to its complexity. PD pulse properties such as\namplitude, shape, and time of occurrence can examine PD\nphenomena keeping into consideration their random behav-\nior. Stochastic behavior of PD can be due to the probability\nof introduction of the initial electrons, region of electric\nﬁeld strength, development of discharge in defects, ion space\ncharge generation rate, variation in the gas constitution and\ndensity, the existence of ionizing radiation, and formation of\nPD pulse from the remainder of previous PD pulse [57].\nPartial discharge in a power transformer can be categorized\ninto ﬁve types: internal discharge, surface discharge, corona\ndischarge, electrical treeing, and barrier discharge [58]. Inter-\nnal discharge occurs due to the formation of cavities inside the\ninsulator during the manufacturing process or due to aging.\nAlso, due to higher voltage/electric stress in the cavities\nas compared to the surrounding medium. PD occurs if the\nvoltage stress inside the cavity is higher than the inception\nvoltage. Surface discharge starts at the high electric ﬁeld\nregion and then propagates to the lower stress region. The\nmain cause of the surface discharge is due to the fact that\ndielectric strength at the interface of the insulations is less\nthan the insulation. The surface discharge may occur is dif-\nferent areas which includes the cable terminal, bushings,\nline-insulator surface. Corona discharge can occur at the\nsharp conducting points, high voltage bare conductors, and\neven sharp points at ground potential in air and transformer\noil. Electrical treeing may occur at a high electric ﬁeld region\ninside the dielectric material due to defects in the form of\na gaseous void, sharp electrode-edge, or metallic particle.\nThe voids under high electric stress generate by-products\n(ultra-violet light and ozone gas) that decompose the insulator\nand produce new voids. The process of voids generation is\nrepeated, creating weak points and form the electrical tree\nthat ﬁnally leads to the breakdown. Electrical treeing can also\nbe formed on the surface of the dielectric under high electric\nﬁeld stress due to contamination which causes ﬂashover on\nthe surface. Dielectric barrier discharge generally occurs due\nto the presence of insulators (generally silica, silica glass,\nceramics, etc.) between the electrode pair [58].\nThe occurrence possibilities of PDs in the power trans-\nformer can be lowered by better design of the insulation\nsystem, reducing manufacturing defects in the drying, and\nimpregnation process. Complete elimination of cavities in\nthe insulation system is an impossible task since an ideal\ninsulator cannot be manufactured.\nDifferent types of defects causing PD can be present within\nthe power transformer oil-paper insulation. The defects are\n(a) voids formation due to the separation of layers of paper\nwrapping the windings, where oil impregnation is absent.\n(b) Moving metallic particles in the insulating oil due to the\naging process of metallic tanks and manufacturing ﬂaws.\n(c) V oids formation in the bushings due to environmental\neffects, humidity, and surge voltage (d) Gas bubbles in the\ninsulating oil due to aging, impurities in oil, and trapped\nmoisture. (e) Trapped moisture in solid insulation during\nthe manufacturing process. (f) The localized static electric\ncharge due to the ﬂow of oil, and the increase of the electric\nﬁeld resulting in the initiation of PD. (g) Tracking in solid\ninsulation [59].\nDifferent physical and chemical processes in defects of the\ninsulation system provide the foundation for PD monitoring\ntechniques. PD investigation started in the 1960s, and for\na decade, the research was performed to study void dis-\ncharge phenomena [60]. Further, in the late 1970s satisfactory\nadvancement took place towards distinct PD mechanisms\nsuch as treeing, ﬂashover, sparks, avalanche, and stream-\ners. [61]–[63]. The physical events occurring due to PD in\nthe insulation systems of the power transformer are [64]:\n(a) Generation of mechanical vibrations results in the creation\nof acoustic waves in the ultrasonic region. (b) Emission of\nelectromagnetic waves in the ultra-high frequency (UHF)\nregion. (c) Ozone and nitrogen-based oxide formation due\nto a chemical reaction. (d) Emission of thermal and light\nenergy [64].\nRecently, data analytics and sensing technology are cre-\nating possibilities for the advancement of the auto-detection\nof PDs through PD monitoring systems [65]–[67]. A typical\nPD monitoring system comprises a PD signal collection unit,\na feature extraction unit, and a data analysis unit. PD signal\ncollection unit encompasses sensors designed to sense the\nphysical phenomena of PD, which emits energy of different\nkinds. PD signals from the detectors can be represented into\ntwo different patterns, which are termed as time-resolved\npartial discharge pattern (TRPD) and phase-resolved partial\ndischarge pattern (PRPD [68]. PRPD represents the ϕ- q-n\nwaveform pattern, where ϕ, q, and n are the PD pulse phase\nangle, the amplitude of the apparent charge or discharge volt-\nage, and the number of pulses, respectively. TRPD signiﬁes\nthe q-t waveform, where ‘t’ is the time of the waveform and\n‘q’ is the same parameter as of PRPD. PRPD’s most common\nillustration is the phase window method, which splits the\npower cycle angle of 360 ◦ into a smaller phase window for\nfeature generation [69]. The feature extraction for the PD\nsignals unit extracts the momentous qualities (features) from\nthe raw data [70]. Further, these features are used in the PD\ndata analysis unit, which is generally furnished with pattern\nrecognition methods such as artiﬁcial neural network, fuzzy\nclustering, and expert system for distinguishing PD from\nnoise or source of PD and its location [71], [72].\nVOLUME 9, 2021 64589\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Overview and PD Analysis of Power Transformers: A Literature Review\nFIGURE 3. Partial Discharge detection techniques.\nIII. PD DETECTION TECHNIQUES\nPDs consist of different physical phenomena having dis-\ntinguished characteristics mainly electromagnetic waves,\ncurrent pulses, heat, vibrations, and acoustic waves.\n[20], [73]–[75]. PD detections and measurements are feasible\ndue to the distinguished physical phenomena, which can\nbe allotted into two groups: electrical and non-electrical\nmethods. Fig. 3 shows different types of PD detection tech-\nniques for power transformers. This section provides a brief\ndescription of the measurement techniques.\nA. ELECTRICAL (EE) DETECTION METHOD\nEE detection methods apply the current pulse generated sig-\nnal detection method. The circuit is directly connected to the\ntesting region where PD activity is present and the current\npulse is detected [76]. The International Electrical and Elec-\ntronics Engineers (IEEE) and the International Electrotech-\nnical Commission (IEC) adopt this method [77]. When using\nthis method, the level of charge due to PD is calculated to\nidentify the condition level of insulation. The International\nCouncil on Large Electric Systems (CIGRE) proposed sur-\nveying the available detection systems for PD in power trans-\nformers [78]. The common electrical detection approaches\nused for condition monitoring of power transformers are\nindirect measurement circuit with external coupling capac-\nitor and coupling capacitor through bushing taps, as shown\nin Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) [79], [80]. In Fig. 4(a), the indirect mea-\nsurement test is performed, where the coupling capacitor (C k)\nis kept in a parallel conﬁguration with the tested insulation\nsystem capacitance (C A). The apparent charge is calculated\nby the PD measurement device attached to the measuring\nimpedance (ZM).\nFor online testing, this method is not used due to a bulky\nhigh voltage coupling capacitor. But, if the bushings tap is\navailable on the power transformer, as shown in Fig. 4(b),\nonline testing can be conducted. Currently, the development\nmethods are not efﬁcient enough to locate the PD activities\nFIGURE 4. (a) IEC 60270 based indirect measurement circuit using\nexternal coupling capacitor. (b) Coupling capacitor through bushing\ntaps [79].\nas online testing is prone to electromagnetic interference but\nis sufﬁcient for ofﬂine testing (eg. routine tests of manufac-\ntured products or pre-commissioning routine tests) [81], [82].\nNevertheless, this method provides indications of the proper\nunderstanding of the insulation condition.\nB. ELECTROMAGNETIC DETECTION METHOD\nThe electromagnetic (EM) method during the initial\ninvestigation showed that at a ﬁxed PD location and\nconstant EM signal propagation, the linear correlation\n64590 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Overview and PD Analysis of Power Transformers: A Literature Review\nbetween the PD charge and the possible signal sources can\nbe obtained [83], [84]. The EM method was ﬁrst introduced\nby W. R. Rutgers for the power transformer in 1997 [85].\nAntennas such as conical, spiral, and Vivaldi are used as\nsensors for ultra-high frequency (UHF) detection [26], [86].\nUHF sensors are actively researched due to their advantages\nsuch as resistance to low-frequency signals, the negligi-\nble effect of noise due to internal transformer construc-\ntion by implementing denoising techniques and removing\nwhite noise, and corona-free pulse disturbance [33], [87].\nUHF detection is affected by radio interference and switching\nevents. The hindrance can be eliminated by careful denoising\ntechniques, which are illustrated in section V . The major\nchallenge for the implementation of UHF sensors is the cal-\nibration process since the measured amplitude is dependent\non a variety of elements.\nIn [88], the authors examined the effect of different\nPD types on UHF calibration in a power transformer whose\ncircuit diagram is shown in Fig. 5. PD sources examined are\nin the form of corona discharge, internal discharge, surface\ndischarge on polyethylene, surface discharge on pressboard,\nand void discharge. Six drain valves help to install differ-\nent UHF probes at different locations. The authors in [88]\nintroduced the best possible detection frequency range to\nmeasure the UHF signal concerning PD apparent charge.\nAlso, they illustrated the big challenge to reduce calibration\nerror due to active transformer parts thereby, it was inefﬁ-\ncient to use the UHF probe. However, the maximum charge\nestimation method was proposed where the least feasible\nratio between the UHF quantiﬁer parameter and IEC apparent\ncharge is achieved in the measurement performed in the\nlaboratory [88].\nDifferent types of current transformers like Rogowski coil,\nhigh-frequency current transformer (HFCT), and radiofre-\nquency current transformer (RFCT) have been extensively\nexplored as sensors for the PD detection in power trans-\nformer [89]–[91]. The EM method can be used for localizing\nmultiple PDs and identifying individual PD sources through\nfeature extraction and de-noising techniques.\nC. ACOUSTIC EMISSION (AE) METHOD\nAE in the power transformer can be produced by a mechanical\nexplosion due to the vaporization of oil near the vicinity of the\nstreamer, electrical arc, and mechanical vibration [92]. The\nsignals are in the form of pressure waves with unique charac-\nteristics for the distinct AE source and can be used to localize\nthe AE source by the detection of ultrasonic signals with a\nfrequency ranging from 40 kHz to hundreds of kHz [93], [94].\nHowever, the acoustic PD signals can be affected by the\nhigh-frequency signals which can be removed by denoising\ntechniques. The advantages of having no EM interference and\nat the same time having an economically friendly technique,\nhave driven the AE method as the most applicable technique\nfor power transformers. Fig. 6 represents the block diagram of\nthe power transformer recording system for the detection of\nAE signals from PD, which is implemented during the normal\nFIGURE 5. Circuit diagram to examine the impact of different types of PD\non UHF calibration in power transformer [88].\nFIGURE 6. Power transformer recording system for the detection of\nAE signals from PD.\noperation of the power transformer [95]. Broadband piezo-\nelectric transducers are common transduction elements for\nmany ultrasonic systems. These are ﬁxed on the transformer\ntank through a magnetic holder for detecting AE signals. The\nAE signals further undergo ampliﬁcation, ﬁltration process\nand are ﬁnally fed and recorded by the AE analyzer.\nThe AE method can be used for detecting multiple\nPD sources [93]. To overcome the incapability of detection\nof PD level and calibration, the AE method is combined with\nother methods such as UHF, optical detection, and electrical\ndetection. The drawbacks of this method are the complex\nbehavior of acoustic emission, low intensity detected sig-\nnals, and high price. AE detection devices include micro-\nphones [96], piezoelectric transducers [93], accelerometer,\nﬁber optic (FO) sensor [93], [97]. Among these AE detection\ndevices, Fiber Optic sensors provide superior results due to\nwide acoustic ﬁeld detection and improved signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR). By denoising and optimization techniques, noise\ndue to internal transformer design can be eliminated, and\nmulti-PD sources can also be detected. However, the main\nproblem of the AE technique is the helplessness of PD source\nlocalization in the transformer winding due to rapid signal\nattenuation by passing through different mediums [98].\nD. GAS PRESENCE METHOD\nDissolve gas analysis utilizes the concept of detection of\ngas es released due to the degradation of the transformer\noil and cellulose insulation [99]. Degradation of transformer\nVOLUME 9, 2021 64591\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Overview and PD Analysis of Power Transformers: A Literature Review\noil results in the liberation of gases in the form of hydrogen\n(H2), methane (CH 4), ethane (C 2H6), acetylene (C 2H2), and\nethylene (C 2H4). While cellulose insulation mainly releases\ngases such as carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide\n(CO2). The DGA is limited to ofﬂine testing in the form of gas\nchromatography [100] and air circulation pump method [101]\nsince this method is time-consuming. The air circulation\npump method is a type of hydrogen detection system where\nhydrogen is detected by the circulation effect of the air pump.\nThe online testing is developed are mainly in the form\nof hydrogen detection [102], photoacoustic spectroscopy\n(PAS) [103], ﬁber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor [102],\noil-immersed sensors [104], and membrane-based tech-\nnique [105]. A typical gas chromatography system is shown\nin Fig. 7 [106], [107]. The injection port vaporizes the oil\nsample. The formed gases, fed into the column, contain\nlighter gases in the form of argon, helium, nitrogen, and\nhydrogen. Each gaseous component is ﬁltered out by the\ncolumn individually based on the retention time and comes\ninto contact with the heat detectors [107]. The detected PD\nsignals are then recorded and plotted with the data acquisition\nsystem creating chromatograms. The identiﬁcation of the\ngases is performed based on the concentration of the gas and\nretention time. Generally, hydrogen gas detection is preferred\nover other detections due to better accuracy. During over-\nheating and discharges, if the hydrogen gas level rises above\nthe warning value, the internal insulations need to be diag-\nnosed [108]. Several types of research have employed FBG\nsensors inside the tank with the normal operating temperature\n(60◦C to 90 ◦C) for detecting the hydrogen gas concentration.\nThis shows a promising future due to non-interferences from\nother gases in addition to the high sensitivity of hydrogen\ngas detection at 80 ◦C [109]. Also, enhanced FBG sensors\n(Pd-capped Mg–Ti thin-ﬁlm-based hydrogen sensor) have\nbeen developed which show sensitivity at a broader range\nof temperature (10 ◦C to 80 ◦C), having considerably higher\nsensitivity than the conventional FBG [110].\nE. OPTICAL METHOD\nThe optical method can become a support tool for detect-\ning the PD activities in power transformer oil. Researchers\nhave carried out different methods for the PD analysis\nthrough the light detection method for transformer oil/paper\ninsulation. Common PD optical detection sensors include\nMach–Zehnder interferometry (MZI), Fabry–Perot interfer-\nometer (EFPI), and ﬁber Bragg grating (FBG) [39]. MZI is\nthe early optical ﬁber-based sensor that uses a single-mode\nﬁber and laser. The beam of light from the source is initially\nsplit into two ﬁbers by a ﬁber coupler. The ﬁrst sensing\nﬁber optic coil is positioned to the zone of the PD signals\nin the oil tank and the second ﬁber is used as the reference\nfor the optical route of the light. EFPI sensor is based on a\nsingle optical ﬁber using a silica diaphragm embedded in the\ncapsuled-shaped silica glass tube. Currently, FBG sensors are\nused in power transformers as they can be directly kept inside\nFIGURE 7. A typical gas chromatograph [107].\nthe oil with the additional beneﬁt of having strong dielectric\nproperty and immunity from electromagnetic interference.\nThe working principle of FBG is depicted in Fig. 8 [111].\nFBG works as the narrowband reﬂective optical sensors,\nwhere a single wavelength of light is reﬂected by grating, and\nthe other wavelengths are transmitted.\nFIGURE 8. Working of Fibre Bragg Grating Sensors [111].\nInitially, in the case of ﬂuorescent optical sensors,\nPD detection from light emission was found possible for\nair and not for transformer oil. In 2013, the optical method\nwas found to be reliable for PD measurement in power\ntransformer through the ﬂuorescent sensor with an uncom-\nmon technique [112]. However, the research for PD detec-\ntion in transformer oil through ﬂuorescent sensors led to\nquestionable results with many ﬂaws. The experiments have\nbeen continuously carried out to connect photon activity,\nPD through optical signal, and PD charge constraints in the\noil. In 2014, the measurement was possible for power trans-\nformer oil [112]. However, this was challenging especially\nfor old transformer oil [113]. The advantages of this method\nare high-frequency response, immunity to electromagnetic\ninterference, measuring a broad range of chemical elements,\nand physical parameters [31]. However, the major drawbacks\nare: the detection of PD cannot be calibrated, no information\non PD magnitude, and limitation to identify discharges within\ntransparent media. The PD detection and localization in trans-\nformer oil are still being researched currently. X-ray emission\nfrom PD source is also being researched for detection testing\ndue to the advantage of bypassing the complex geometry of\nthe power transformer.\n64592 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Overview and PD Analysis of Power Transformers: A Literature Review\nFIGURE 9. Photo-acoustic spectroscopy-based DGA system [115].\nTABLE 1. Advantages and Drawback of different Partial Discharge Detection Techniques in Power Transformer.\nF. COMBINATIONAL METHOD\nFor the detection and localization of PD faults in power\ntransformers, the combination of DGA and AE methods\nhas been used. For the existence of PD in transformers,\nofﬂine DGA has been implemented ﬁrst, then to locate PD\nsources, AE detection for 24 hours has been implemented\nfor copying the daily load cycle [114]. Photo-Acoustic Spec-\ntroscopy (PAS) is an example of a combination of the DGA\nand AE method. Fig. 9 illustrates the working principle of\nPAS [115]. The infrared source provides kinetic energy to the\nfault gases. Whereas the microphone detects the pressure sig-\nnal and transfers it into the electrical signals. Different gases\ndetected are based on the intensity of sound waves produced,\nwhich are ﬁltered through optical ﬁlters. The combination of\nEM and acoustic methods have been used in which ultrasonic\nand UHF sensors were arranged in different shapes to provide\nworthy performance to detect PD sources for a particular\ndistance [116]. An example was proposed with the hybrid PD\ndetecting system by transient earth wire voltage (TEV) and\nAE sensors [117]. Innovative forms of AE detection methods\ninclude AE sensors for locating the PD with a signal from EE\nfor the reference time which allows locating and verifying\nthat the signal detected is not the noise [118].\nThe combinations of AE, EE, and DGA have been used\nfor the PD identiﬁcation method to ﬁnd the overall insulation\ncondition of the transformer [119]. By using EE and EM\ntechniques, a noise rejection system could be created for the\nPD detection, where data from EE detection can be used to\ndetect the PD source. AE method can be enhanced to have\nbetter sensitivity by combining with the EE method where\nEE detection is used for triggering.\nIn AE and optical combination method, Fabry-Perot ﬁber\n(AE sensor) has been used for PD localization, and ﬂu-\norescent optical ﬁber (optical sensor) is used as the con-\nﬁrmation that the reference signal has been initiated from\nthe PD source [120]. Table 1 compares the advantages and\ndrawbacks of different PD detection techniques used in power\ntransformers.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 64593\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Overview and PD Analysis of Power Transformers: A Literature Review\nIV. PD DIAGNOSTICS IN POWER TRANSFORMER\nPD diagnosis of power transformers is a powerful tool to\nclassify various faults. The main purpose of PD diagnosis is\nto identify the cause of PD in the insulation and distinguish\nthe type of defects. Since power transformers have a highly\ncomplex insulation system with almost inaccessible inner\ncomponents, PD diagnosis is demanding and challenging.\nOnline testing is performed and limited to the transformer\ntank and transformer terminals due to the compact structure.\nFor achieving a proper diagnosis, advanced testing devices\nalong with experienced personnel is mandatory.\nAs per IEC 60270 standards, the PD measurement by the\nelectrical method has excessive noise content due to sensi-\ntivity restrictions [121]. The UHF method has a high EM\nfrequency range (300 MHz–3000 MHz) and the PD in trans-\nformer oil releases EM waves in the same range. UHF sensors\ninstallation can be performed inside the transformer by an\noil ﬁlling valve during the state of operation, which provides\ndecent PD signal detection due to EM resistance from the\nsurroundings by the transformer tank [122]. To record PD\nactivity by EE or EM method, localization of PD can be\nperformed by the time of arrival of acoustic signals through\npiezo-electric sensors that are fastened on the wall of the\ntransformer tank [123]. The problem is that the acoustic\nsignals contain distortion due to the complex structure of\nthe transformer. It can be resolved by denoising and crafting\naveraged signals where acoustic PD signals are overlapped,\nand the noise is nulliﬁed by averaging.\nThe physical parameters are the main distinction between\nthe EM and EE PD measurement method, where the former\nmeasure voltage (in mV) by sensing EM radiation through\nUHF sensors and the latter measure apparent charge level\n(in pC) by integrating the recharging current [124]. In factory\nacceptance tests (FAT), the apparent charge (pC) is accept-\nable considering the fact that the real PD value (pC/mV) is\nundetermined s the measurement is not directly taken [125].\nUHF sensors can overcome the challenge of online monitor-\ning due to surrounding noise and the occurrence of corona\ndischarges since the UHF antenna can measure PD incidence\nin transformer oil as the transformer tank behaves as the\nFaraday cage [84]. By this advantage, UHF sensors can be\nimplemented for ofﬂine as well as online routine tests. EE and\nEM measurements are predominantly affected by the type\nand the level of PD source, signal diminution in the connect-\ning path, sensitivity of the sensors, and measurement device\nsensitivity.\nThe effect of quadrupole or coupling capacitor in the sen-\nsitivity of electrical measurement can be amended by the cal-\nibration process. For this, the parameter antenna factor (AF)\nshould be identiﬁed. AF depends on the design in terms of\nEM waves and can be estimated by an oil-ﬁlled gigahertz-\ntransversal-electro-magnetic setup (GTEM) cell [122]. The\nconstruction of the GTEM cell comprises of an elongated\ncoaxial cable in a cell, and with isolation from surrounding\nEM disturbance, a known EM ﬁeld is introduced to the\nequipment under test (EUT). GTEM cell is considered as the\ninitial step of calibration and reﬂects only the effect of the\nsensor. For the competency of the measurement, the UHF\nantenna is connected to the transformer for measuring the\ncalibration sensitivity. In [122], ﬁrstly, an identiﬁed UHF\ncalibration impulse is introduced without an antenna for cal-\nibrating cable and measurement devices. Then, the sensor\nfeature is added to the calibrated path by applying AF. Intro-\nducing the identiﬁed transfer function through frequency-\ndependent, AF can provide variation of the calibration point\nfrom calibrator to antenna in the transformer. The calibra-\ntion process can be shortened by using scalar correction\nfactor AFs, showing PD frequencies with enough accuracy.\nPower transformer online monitoring with diagnostics has\nbecome a necessity now due to the majority of transform-\ners being installed more than four decades back [126]. Per-\nforming continuous monitoring help to detect and resolve\nsudden faults which minimize any future hazards. The data\ngenerated through monitoring are very high and therefore\nneed further analysis. One of the common analyses is phase-\nresolved PD pattern analysis based on pattern recognition.\nThe characterization of PD patterns received from online\nmonitoring is performed and compared with the recognized\npattern [33].\nV. PD DENOISING TECHNIQUES IN POWER\nTRANSFORMER\nPartial discharge pulses are irregular, short-lived, and non-\nperiodic. The obtained partial discharge signals extracted\nfrom the PD sensors contain excess discharge impulse, which\nis challenging for the processing task. The obtained sig-\nnals need to be disintegrated further by signal processing\ntechniques. Taking multiple PD sources generated at dif-\nferent insulation into consideration, the signal processing\ntechniques becomes handy. The process is conducted by\napplying the time and frequency characteristics of obtained\nPD signals to create unique collections of time-frequency\nmaps. Each collection is allocated to a PD source. Various sig-\nnal denoising techniques are fast Fourier transform, low pass\nﬁltering, Wigner-Ville Distribution, short-time Fourier trans-\nform, least mean squares (LMS) approach, frequency-domain\nadaptive ﬁltering (FDAF), recursive least squares (RLS),\nand exponentially weighted recursive least squares (EWRLS)\nmethods, matched ﬁltering, notch ﬁltering, wavelet denois-\ning, artiﬁcial neural network, empirical mode decomposition,\nand blind equalization [127]–[130]. Some common denoising\ntechniques are explained as follows:\nA. FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM\nFFT is the algorithm developed for computing discrete\nFourier Transform (DFT) which is applied to the PD sig-\nnal to transform from the time domain to the frequency\ndomain [27]. FFT is effective for the slow varying signals\nhaving stationary components. Since the property of PD sig-\nnals is rapidly changing, non-periodic, irregular, and transient\nin nature, therefore, Wavelet Transform is preferred over this\nmethod [131].\n64594 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Overview and PD Analysis of Power Transformers: A Literature Review\nB. WAVELET TRANSFORM\nFourier transform decomposes any signal into sinusoidal\nwaveforms along with the frequency domain, but the time\ndata is absent. Wavelet transform is used to decompose\nthe signals and is a small waveform that has a very short\nperiod and with zero average magnitudes [132]. These are\ntime-domain signals in the form of two-dimensional sets of\ncoefﬁcients and, therefore, conﬁning them into the time and\nfrequency domain. They are employed for ﬁnding parameters\nsuch as the breakdown points and noise elimination [133].\nThe signal is fragmented into different wavelet coefﬁcients\ninto different frequency ranges. The wavelet transform can\nrebuild the PD signals when the wavelet function counterparts\nthe PD signals. By the thresholding, the wavelet coefﬁcient\nof PD signals is retained and the rest are eliminated [130].\nThe two different ways to prepare the wavelet trans-\nform are continuous wavelet transform and discrete wavelet\ntransform [134]. The former acquires the surface of wavelet\ncoefﬁcients, while the latter has the discretized scale and\ntranslation.\nC. ENSEMBLE EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION\nEnsemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is a\nmethod which is used to extract Intrinsic Mode Func-\ntion (IMF) from the signals and can be handy for non-\nstationary and non-linear signal [129]. Hilbert Huang trans-\nform (HHT) comprises two sections: Ensemble mode decom-\nposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis. HHT is widely\nused in fault analysis but contains ﬂaws in the EMD tech-\nnique, where the problem arises due to the mode mixing\nproblem during the sifting process. EEMD is a noise-assisted\nanalysis technique that is more robust with better accu-\nracy [135], [136]. PD signal is disintegrated by eliminating\nthe riding waves and smooth irregular amplitude that could\nbe rooted in the IMF. This is termed as a sifting process\nthat limits the upper and lower measured signal, evaluates\nthe average values of the boundaries, and deducts them from\nthe measured signal. In general, IMF is a single component\nsignal, but the IMF repeatedly clinches disparate frequency\nsignals. This procedure is further reiterated on the residual\npart of the measured signal until all the IMF is acquired. The\nsignal can be rebuilt by adding all IMF. For improving the\ndiscrimination of noise and PD signal in EEMD, synthesized\nwhite noise is added to the measured signal as sometimes they\nfail to distinguish them [137].\nIn [136], the self-adaptive denoising techniques by using\nEEMD were proposed to eliminate the drawback of WT and\nEMD. By utilizing the kurtosis-based selection criterion, the\nEEMD method was found to be effective in reducing the noise\nto a great extent and retrieve PD impulses without conceding\nthe quality of PD impulses.\nD. MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY\nThis technique necessitates earlier knowledge of the repet-\nitive frequency of the signal, which cannot be availed in\nsome applications. The theory of mathematical morphology\nis centered on a mathematical operator that is implemented\nbetween the measured signal, and the structured element\n(ﬂat, sinusoidal, or triangular element) [138]. The ﬁltration\nof the PD signal is done by the overlapping of the struc-\ntured element and the measured signal, where the ﬁltered\nsignal is denoted as a morphological feature [40]. In [136],\nthe mathematical morphology was found to be noteworthy\nfor denoising the PD signals.\nE. BLIND EQUALIZATION (BE)\nBlind equalization is the type of de-noising technique where\nhigher frequencies are eliminated, which are generally pro-\nduced by communication systems and radio transmission at\nsubstations [130]. Blind source separation (BSS) and BE\nare targeted to retrieve source signal without evaluating the\nsource [139]. Also, there is a drawback that it requires more\nnumbers of PD sensors than that of the number of PD sources.\nIn [130], the author proposed an automatic BE technique\nfor denoising PD signals in power transformers where tech-\nniques BSS and BE were used for recovering the source signal\nwithout evaluating the source. The denoised PD signal vali-\ndated the effectiveness of the PD extraction by suppressing\nthe high noise level.\nF. ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK\nThe multilayer feed-forward neural network (MLPFNN) has\nbecome the center of attention to denoise the PD discharge\nsignals [128]. Function approximation is applied due to the\ncapability to discover the bond between the input and output\ndata with the weights of these connected input and output\ndata that are updated by the backpropagation algorithm. The\nLavenberg-Marquardt algorithm that is used to manufacture\nperfectly denoised PD signals by changing the number of\nnodes in the hidden layer is implemented in the hidden\nlayers for enhancing the performance of MLPFNN [140].\nTo improve the quality of the denoised signal, the number of\nnodes in the ANN architecture is increased keeping in mind\nthe processing time.\nSome research works have been performed to inves-\ntigate the capability of ANN-based PD signal denoising\ntechniques [128], [141]. In [128], the authors implemented\nthe comparison of the performance of ANN with fast\nFourier transform (FFT) and wavelet transform (WT) to con-\nclude the ANN-based denoising technique to be superior\nto other techniques. In [141], the authors performed ANN\n(curve ﬁtting and function approximation) and WT (energy\nconservation-based method (ECBT)) denoising technique to\nremove white noise of radio frequency (RF) signals for\nceramic disc insulators having defects in the form of internal\nvoids, cracks, and sharp points. The result of ANN-based\ndenoising was found to be better than ECBT.\nVI. FEATURE EXTRACTION OF POWER TRANSFORMER\nFeature extraction is an important process for the\nanalysis of the PD signals of the power transformer.\nCommon feature extraction techniques include Fourier\ntransform, wavelet packet decomposition, Hilbert–Huang\nVOLUME 9, 2021 64595\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Overview and PD Analysis of Power Transformers: A Literature Review\ntransforms (HHT), stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE),\nprinciple component analysis (PCA), kernel principal compo-\nnent analysis (KPCA), support vector machine (FSVM), and\nartiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) [51], [142]. This section\nis focused on the statistical overview of feature extraction\nin power transformers. Fig. 10 represents the ﬂowchart of\nthe partial discharge monitoring system. The monitoring\nsystem comprises of three sections, namely PD signal collec-\ntion, feature extraction for PD signal, and PD data analysis.\nAfter applying the denoising techniques and localization of\nPD signals, the ﬁltered data can be represented by two\ndifferent patterns, namely PRPD and TRPD. While analyzing\nPD, very high dimensional data are quite common, which\nrequire dimension reduction techniques. PRPD characteriza-\ntion can be classiﬁed into two different groups; the number of\nPD pulse vs. phase angle and amplitude of charge vs. phase\nangle which can be categorized further in positive and nega-\ntive half-cycles [143]. Statistical features that can be obtained\nfrom these distributions are namely skewness, mean, vari-\nance, kurtosis, and Weibull [144]. The advantage of statistical\nfeatures is decreased computation time. In [145], the author\nincluded a statistical feature analysis for the extraction of\nPD signals in transformer insulation defects. Kurtosis and\nskewness show the sharpness and symmetry of the distri-\nbution respectively. Weibull distribution portrays the pulse\nheight analysis pattern where the PD pulse rate can be shown\nin the probability distribution curve. The features of Weibull\ndistribution in addition to other parameters after analysis are\nserved to the intelligent classiﬁers.\nFractal features can be applied to model PD and pattern\nrecognition due to the ability to model complicated struc-\ntures and natural phenomena where presently, the mathe-\nmatical means are inadequate [146]. In [147], the author\nperformed fractal-based feature extraction for the identiﬁ-\ncation of PD patterns for high voltage power transformers.\nPRPD patterns can be processed through box-counting tech-\nniques that use two fractal features; fractal dimension (com-\nputation for image surface) and lacunarity (fractal surface\ncompactness) [147]. Even though fractal dimension does not\naffect due to variation in scale and promising measurement\nof the surface coarseness, the ineffectiveness to distinguish\nfeature of the same value of fractal surface resulted in the\ndevelopment of another variable termed lacunarity [148]. The\nresearch was performed based on the removal data contam-\ninated by noise in which PRPD patterns were transformed\ninto a binary image, and fractal features calculations were\nperformed through ImageJ [143]. Principle component anal-\nysis (PCA) is used to ﬁlter essential data from big data\ngroups thereby serves as the data reduction techniques [149].\nPCA, also termed as Karhunen-Loève (K-L) method does\nnot negotiate with the data information, and with very low\ndepletion of information, data can be shrunken to compact\nspace. Space reduction is attained through data projection\nin the broadest variance at the lesser dimension that will\nboost the scatter of the desired samples [150]. The number\nof principal components for attaining the precise value of\nactual data can be achieved through a scree plot, which is the\ngraph of eigenvalue magnitude vs. its number [145]. In [91],\nPCA was implemented for the autonomous localization of the\nPD source within transformer winding showing the capability\nto locate the PD source.\nMachine learning techniques (Artiﬁcial neural networks)\nhave currently shown decent efﬁciency for PD detection and\nrecognition [151]–[153]. In [154], the authors used four types\nof artiﬁcial PD defects (ﬂoating, surface, rod-plane, and air\ngap discharge) for PD identiﬁcation, which is similar to the\nintelligent framework for power transformer assessment as\nproposed in [155]. A deep learning approach called sparse\nauto-encoder (SAE) was used for feature extraction. The deep\nlearning method of SAE and Softmax exhibited promising\nresults of more than 96% accuracy.\nVII. PD CLASSIFICATION IN POWER TRANSFORMER\nPD classiﬁcation in the transformer is a valuable supervised\nlearning technique since it can organize various kinds of\ndefects into their respective category for condition assess-\nment. These appropriate classiﬁers are necessary as any inde-\ncision may result in the wrong classiﬁcation of the PD model.\nAlso, the precision of the PD classiﬁcation depends on the\nfeatures extracted through the PD pattern. Recent artiﬁcial\nintelligence techniques have shown decent PD classiﬁcation\nof PD defects in power transformers.\nANN can be the proper classiﬁcation for PD pattern anal-\nysis due to the insensitivity to the minor input deviation\nand making appropriate decisions during the training pro-\ncess while feeding the data that is quite similar to the input\ndata [156]. ANN is the supervised learning process where\ntraining employs forward and backward processes, and ini-\ntialization is performed through the weights and biases hav-\ning small value [157]. The activation function provides the\ncomputation of the feature vector in their respective output\nlayers. The layers in between the input and output layers\nthat are connected and cascaded together to form a network\nare termed hidden layers. Hidden layers attribute to acquire\nthe PD features from various sources and send the extracted\nsources to the output. The classiﬁcation is done based on\nthe types of PD defects to be classiﬁed. In [158], the author\nproposed a convolutional Neural network (CNN) architecture\nfor UHF signal PD pattern source recognition which is shown\nin Fig. 11. The input to CNN is 1 × 128 × 256 generated\nby Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The ﬁrst three\nhidden layers comprise ﬁlters, pooling layers, and dropout\nlayers. The ﬁnal two hidden layers are fully connected with\n500 hidden units each, and the output layer is a fully con-\nnected linear layer. By the proposed architecture, the data\naccumulated from gas-insulated switchgear showed decent\naccuracy and further help in developing more ideas for PD\nUHF signal recognition for power transformers.\nAdaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is the\nhybrid system of neural network and fuzzy system that uses a\nneural network to eliminate the necessity of ﬁnding a suitable\nfuzzy network for operation [159]. Takagi and coworkers\n64596 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. R. Hussainet al.: Overview and PD Analysis of Power Transformers: A Literature Review\nFIGURE 10. Flowchart for partial discharge monitoring system.\nFIGURE 11. Convolutional Neural Network- based PD classification [158].\ncreated ANFIS that is based on the fuzzy Sugeno model,\nwhich is a proﬁcient tool for classifying PD patterns by\nimplementing If-Then rules through a decision tree andspec-\niﬁed input-output data [160]. For improving the efﬁciency\nof the training, input variables are regularized between zero\nand one. In [161], the authors implemented a fuzzy and\nANFIS model for PD fault detection using DGA for power\ntransformer where the ANFIS model was found to be superior\nwith an accuracy of 98%.\nSupport vector machine (SVM) is derived from statistical\nlearning, where the regulation is managed for several tasks by\napplying base algorithms and kernel functions [162]. In this\nmethod, PD pattern data can be portrayed by vector dimen-\nsion depending on the number of input features and perform\ndecently in the complications related to non-linearity, lesser\nsample magnitude, and large dimensions [163]. Kernel’s\nmethod is the additional tool to overcome the inefﬁciency to\nanalyze non-linear problems.\nThe authors in [164], performed the classiﬁcation of PD\npattern based on SVM for the ﬂoating metallic particles in\nthe transformer oil showing promising results irrespective\nof big data and complexity. In [165], the authors per-\nformed different PD classiﬁcations for the AE-based sig-\nnals for transformer insulation where SVM performance was\nfound to be superior to the decision tree and K-nearest\nneighbor.\nThe decision tree method comprises a type of ﬂowchart\nassembly in which the internal node is used for the fea-\nture testing, the leaf node shows the class label, and the\nroute between the root and the leaf shows the classiﬁcation\nrule [182]. This method has been used extensively in the\nPD classiﬁcations under different PD conditions due to the\nadvantage of the visible rule for PD classiﬁcation, unlike\nSVM or ANN. A decision tree had been employed to identify\nthe void size and differentiating the multiple PD sources\nin power transformers [183]. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is\na simple and non-parametric algorithm that classiﬁes the\ntraining sets by recognizing the collection of k objects nearest\nto test objects and allotting the type through correlation of\nthe respective class in the neighborhood [184]. The main\nelements of KNN are labeled objects, constant ‘k’, and the\nquantity of nearest neighbors. The classiﬁcation of KNN is\ncentered on fresh data points according to greater votes for\nthe neighboring data points.\nVIII. PD CLUSTERING IN POWER TRANSFORMER\nPD signal clustering is the unsupervised learning technique\nwhere the data are organized into clusters such that each\ncluster element is closely associated with the other. The clus-\ntering technique is extensively used in PRPD and TRPD for\ndistinguishing the characteristics of PD pulse in the multiple\nVOLUME 9, 2021 64597\nM. R.

Recent timeline of partial discharge analysis in power transformer.\nPD sources and arranging in groups. Table 2 shows a recent\ntimeline of partial discharge analysis in power transformers.\nK-means (KM) is an efﬁcient and uncomplicated centroid-\nbased clustering algorithm where parameter ‘K’ represents\nthe pre-deﬁned number of clusters chosen for iteration.\nK-means clustering is applied until the convergence between\nthe assignment step, and the update step is achieved [185].\nHowever, this method has limitations in the form of local\nminimum convergence and pre-assigned value of K, which\nmay be challenging due to the lack of information regarding\nthe numbers of different PD sources [186]. Another version\nof K-means is Fuzzy C-means (FCM) in which in each cluster\nevery object is assigned a fuzzy degree [187], [188]. Soft\nclustering is done for each object where each object can\nbe allocated in different clusters while optimizing. In [189],\nthe author proposed K-means with SVM clustering-based\ntechniques for DGA in the power transformer for improving\naccuracy. The result found was better for KMSVM relative to\nSVM and k-mean clustering with a reduction in the training\nset and training time.\nThe density-based spatial clustering of applications with\nnoise (DBSCAN) is the clustering algorithm prepared by\nMartin Ester and coworkers in 1996 [190]. Unlike K-means,\nDBSCAN does not require allocation of the number of clus-\nters but assigns the data which are dense and closely related in\nclusters. However, DBSCAN fails in the proper clustering of\nsimilar density data and high dimensionality data. DBSCAN\nworks on the two parameters: the number of minimum points\nin the neighborhood of point p (Minpts), and the radius\nof neighborhood p (Eps). In [191], the authors performed\nautomatic pulse grouping through DBSCAN for PD source\nseparation in power transformer where the effectiveness of\nthe DBSCAN algorithm over conventional means is evident.\nThe PD sources are notable by the DBSCAN algorithm,\nwhereas conventional cannot completely separate the PD\nsources. Furthermore, by the PRPD diagram, the different\nsources are noticeably recognized.\nHierarchical cluster analysis is the clustering algorithm\nwhere the clusters are generated in the order of domi-\nnancy from top to bottom (divisive) or bottom to the top\nway (agglomerative) [149]. In the agglomerative hierarchical\nclustering, objects are initially taken as separate clusters.\nFurther, according to the distance between the two objects,\nthe individual clusters are merged, and the procedure is fol-\nlowed until the conditions are fulﬁlled. Divisive clustering\nhas initial single clusters where all objects are allocated and\nfurther separated into different clusters according to the con-\ndition [3]. This method can be productive for examining big\nstructures but slow in processing. Also, it lags modiﬁcation\nafter developing the splitting/merging decision.\nIX. CONCLUSION\nThis paper enumerates the comprehensive survey of mod-\nern techniques for PD signal analysis of power transform-\ners. PD detection, localization, and severity of fault can be\nanalyzed through feature representation, classiﬁcation, and\nclustering techniques, which are extensively reviewed. Dif-\nferent methodologies for denoising the PD signals have been\nintroduced. PD detection in the power transformer is essential\nsince the power system network depends completely on con-\ntinuous operation. The paper explains the overview of partial\ndischarge with different types of defects in power transform-\ners. Different types of PD detection techniques (electrical\nand non-electrical) have been explained, and the advantages\nand disadvantages of each technique have been elaborated.\nThe importance of PD diagnostics for identifying the type of\npower transformer PD defects has been elucidated. The PD\nmonitoring system consists of different steps for analyzing\nPD defects. This includes PD detection, denoising, feature\nextraction, classiﬁcation, and clustering. Each step has been\nelaborated, including the insight of the modern methods. The\nonline PD measurements in a power transformer are proﬁ-\ncient means for PD analysis with the challenge of the onsite\nnoise and due to the complex structure of the power trans-\nformer. PD sensing techniques can be advanced to reduce\nthe impact of white noise in online sensing and to locate\nPD activities in the power transformer.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe statements made herein are solely the responsibility of\nthe authors.\n64600 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM.
