The time has come for the d igital \ntransformation of education with the need to develop new ways to solve urgent problems \n[2]. The introduction of digital platforms leads to a wider application of Internet \ntechnologies and determined by «integration of social networks, electronic por tfolios, \nmassive online courses, interactive tasks, digital means of storing and selling material» in \nthe educational environment, including the system of foreign language training [3]. \nConducting an online lesson differs from teaching a lesson offline, an d it is a mistake to \nbelieve that offline learning experience can be easily transferred to the Internet, even taking \n                                                           \n Corresponding author: vonog_vita@mail.ru \nICTP 2021\nSHS Web of Conferences 113 , 00019 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202111300019\n  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Successful webinar delivery requires the digital \ncompetence of the teacher [4] and careful preparati on [5]. Choosing a video conferencing \nplatform suitable for teachers and learners' needs can be beneficial if the (dis)advantages \nand possibilities of that one have been presented. According to challenges that any teacher \nmay face in terms of online classe s, it would be appropriate to designate this thesis as a key \nproblem of the study. \n1.1 The objective of the work \nAccording to authors’ point of view, the system of teaching English integrates as range of \ndidactic means, chosen by a teacher in connection with t he goal of teaching a foreign \nlanguage in a non-linguistic university, allow for systematic and methodological support of \nthe educational process and «coordinate the course of training future specialists» [6]. Such \na system proves its effectiveness in mode ling and simulating real production situations in \nthe educational environment [7]. Moreover, the system can change its tools resulting in \nadapting them to new conditions of interaction of all participants in the educational process. \nDigital platforms Zoom (https://zoom.us), Skype (www.skype.com), Webinar \n(https://webinar.ru), Discord (https://discord.com) have become very popular in the system \nof teaching English in connection with digitalization of educational environmen t as well as \nthe pandemic of the coronavirus infection Covid -19, which has reached a global scale [8 -\n10]. Implementation of work with these platforms is carried out in online version for \nbrowsers or in the application for smart phones and computers. \nInteraction in real time with a large number of opportunities makes it popular among \nparticipants in the educational process. On the one hand, despite the similarity of a virtual \nlesson with a real one, the interactive aspects of communication online are formed with \ngreater complexity due to distance and the absence of face -to-face contact. Maintaining \ninteraction between the teacher and the student in a digital environment is an urgent \nproblem, since the participants communicate at a distance. Communication is i ncomplete \ndue to limited display of the communicator and video delay. The distance between users \nincreases, which can lead to a lack of appropriate interaction and concentration on solving a \nspecific situational problem. It is important for the teacher to control the involvement of \nstudents in the lesson, to be available to them, to assess the learning situation.  \nOn the other hand, these digital platforms find wide application due to meeting needs of \nsociety in the implementation of communication in the edu cational process. \nCommunication at these sites made it possible to some extent to imitate educational \ninteraction, bringing it closer to the usual traditional by establishing audio and video \ncontact. Online meetings in the format of webinars, video lecture s and videoconferences \nhave found application as an alternative to lectures, seminars and practical exercises [11]. \nVarious forms of webinars, such as simple webinars, webinars in the panel discussion \nformat and webinars with the involvement of a distant g uest [1], allow solving many \neducational problems: from daily tasks to the tasks of final control. Taking into account a \nwide range of functional possibilities provided by digital platforms the authors aim at \ncomparing them in terms of adaptation in teachi ng English and coping with problems the \nteachers may face. \n2. Results of the research \nAnalysis of recent research devoted to the problems of pedagogical guidance, in particular \nto digitalization used in higher education, shows that growing attention is giv en to some \naspects of learning a foreign language using computer technologies and digital platforms. It \nis necessary to pay special attention to the fact that competence -based approach \nICTP 2021\nSHS Web of Conferences 113 , 00019 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202111300019\n2\nimplemented in the system of teaching English by means of “systematic i ntegration into a \nholistic educational process through content, technologies and environmental factors” [ 5]. \nThe key aspect that affects both the content and the technologies of education in the modern \nworld is digitalization (English digitalization - the transition to a digital type of coding, \nwhich, however, is not just a technical process, but a sociocultural and anthropological one, \namong other things). \nThe study of using digital platforms and tools in teaching a foreign language is the \nsubject of the r esearch efforts of such Russian and foreign scientists as I.Yu. Konoreva, \nS.V. Titova, E.S. Polat, P.V. Sysoev, L.V. Shkerina, V.A. Shershneva, V.N. Sidorov, T.V. \nSidorova, K.V. Safonov, I.B. Korotkina, E.V. Talalakina, K. Facer, Otto Peters, J. W atson, \nD. Whitelock et al [12-25]. \nAuthors of the research paper “E -learning in Tertiary Education: Where Do we Stand?” \nrefer E-learning to the use of information and communications technology (ICT) to enhance \nand/or support learning in tertiary education. It cover s a wide range of systems, from \nstudents using e -mail and accessing course work online while following a course on \ncampus to programmes offered entirely online. \nOtto Peters in his investigation “Digit al Learning Environments:  New Possibilities and \nOpportunities” (International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning Vol.  1, \n№. 1 (June 2000) convinces that “Tertiary education institutions generally feel that e -\nlearning has a broadly positive effect on the quality of teaching and learning, although few \nhave been able to offer detailed evidence. There is much indirect eviden ce, including \nstudent satisfaction surveys, but these may not be enough to offset the prevalent doubt \nabout the pedagogic value of online learning among students and academics. Digital \nlearning environments open up new opportunities and chances not only fo r heteronymous \nbut also for autonomous learning”. \nThe issue of digital storage of an unlimited amount of authentic information is discussed \nby Watson (2008). Special attention is paid to increasing the autonomy and independent \nwork of the student when work ing with hypertext and web pages (Titova, 2017; Sysoyev et \nal., 2015; Whitelock, 2008). \nThere are some papers where authors identify problems, propose teaching methods, and \nassess the advantages and disadvantages in the context of digitalization. For examp le, Yu. I. \nDavydenko in the article \"Teaching autonomous reading in a foreign language at a \ntechnical university: criteria for selecting text material\". (Proceedings of BSTU. Series 4: \nPrint and Media Technologies 2017) identifies the problems that hinder the effective \nteaching of a foreign language and suggests ways to solve them by creating an information \nand communication learning environment for learning. \nThe role of increasing students' interest and motivation in learning foreign languages \nthrough a va riety of digital platforms, different from traditional ones, is studied by Polat \n(2010) and Shershneva et al. (2016). \nThe increased interest in the capabilities of digital tools pushed developers to expand \nthe functionality, which has a positive impact on the technological qualities at the moment. \nLet's consider and compare the functionality of Zoom, Skype, Webinar, Discord.  \nAll of these tools provide audio and video contact, which, in relation to teaching \nEnglish, contributes to two -way communication, as w ell as being participants in dialogues \nand polylogs, asking questions, conducting disputes, organizing discussions, etc. The \nability to establish visual contact allows you to read non -verbal signals and simulate as \nmuch as possible live communication, char acteristic of face-to-face classes, which teachers \nget used to. \nUnfortunately, there is a problem that many teachers have faced, namely, the lack of \npossibility and wish of students to turn on the camera during class. On the one hand, this \ncan be explained  by technical difficulties, since most of the students use the mobile \nICTP 2021\nSHS Web of Conferences 113 , 00019 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202111300019\n3\nInternet, i.e. you can either turn on the video or read the text located on the screen. The \nlatter is often preferable for the educational process. On the other hand, the ability to not \nturn on the camera means a more comfortable environment for students, especially if the \nhome environment does not have the ability to share the background with all participants in \nthe online meeting. In January 2021, a survey of 68 students of School of En gineering and \nConstruction of Siberian Federal University showed that 81% of respondents turn on the \ncamera in the classroom only at the request of the teacher, one student always turns on and \none student never turns on. \nThe identified problem prompts the search for other ways of expressing a response. \nZoom, Skype, Webinar and Discord enable interactive gesture substitutions to express \napproval or other emotion, which is especially important when learning a foreign language. \nThe raised hand gesture symboliz es the student's readiness to answer the question. The \nthumbs up gesture indicate agreement or acts as approval. It is noteworthy that this \nfunctionality appeared on the Webinar.ru platform only in 2020 [26]. \nUsing a chat is another important feature of th ese digital tools. Chats serve as a platform \nfor written communication in a foreign language, allow you to conduct diagnostic surveys, \nreceive quick feedback individually or in a group, and also check the involvement of \nstudents in the educational process. \nScreen sharing lets you share your desktop, documents, tutorials, browser tabs, etc. This \nis especially important when paper handouts cannot be used. Screen sharing allows the \nstudent to share materials they are currently working on with the teacher or ot her students, \nas well as demonstrate a project presentation. In response, the student has the opportunity to \nreceive quick feedback, comments and feedback on the project [27, 28]. \nIn terms of lesson planning these platforms allows us to plan our online les son in \nadvance. Thus, they act not only as a video broadcasting platform but as a calendar as well. \nScheduling classes in a calendar allows the teacher to keep a log of upcoming events and \npromptly remind students of the next lesson. \nWhen working in a virt ual classroom, the teacher's role expands. He doesn’t act as a \nteacher, he acts as a moderator of the online class. Each lesson -event has a closed format, \nwhich means that it is necessary to obtain an individual code and a videoconference \npassword before t he lesson. Each potential student's participation is approved by the \nteacher. Such a system duplicates the educational process in real time and does not allow \nthird parties to attend the lesson, keeping the privacy and the course of the lesson like an \noffline lesson. \nBesides above mentioned tools in the form of screen broadcast and whiteboard, the \nplatforms provide conference participants with such creative tools as audio streaming. Due \nto this tool students can complete listening assignments. A more creati ve tool is to use an \nalternative background during the conference. With the help of the participants' background \nreplacement tool, the teacher can give students tasks to speculate the situation, where the \nbackground plays an additional role and allows stud ents to be involved in the work more \nactively. \nLet us turn to the aspects that are unique for individual tools of the foreign language \ntraining system (see Table 1). \nAccording to the results of the study by the authors, Zoom and Webinar.ru are the most \nconvenient platforms in comparison with Skype and Discord for the interaction of all \nparticipants in the educational process within the framework of the foreign language \ntraining system. A number of authors also support the popularity of Zoom on the basis of \nthe sociological study \"Opinion of students of Russian universities on forced distance \nlearning\", conducted in May – June 2020 [29]. \n \n \nICTP 2021\nSHS Web of Conferences 113 , 00019 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202111300019\n4\nTable 1.

Let us add that Zoom and Webinar.ru are not only video \nbroadcasting platforms, but are also a calendar for its participants: the teacher keeps a log \nof upcoming events, and the platform reminds students in a timely manner about the next \nlesson. During online interaction, the teacher simultaneously acts as a moderator and \nadministrator. Each lesson has a closed format, which involves obtaining an in dividual code \nand password for a video conference before a foreign language lesson. The participation of \neach potential student is approved by the administrator -teacher. Such a system duplicates \nthe educational process in real time and does not allow third  parties to attend the lesson, \nkeeping the privacy and the course of the lesson like an offline lesson [30-32]. \nThe ability to record video, as well as work in separate session rooms, are other similar \ncharacteristics of Zoom and Webinar.ru. With the help of the Session Rooms tool, the \nteacher provides interactivity and feedback of interaction with students, which can become \nan additional incentive to optimize students' independent work. Thanks to the cooperation \nICTP 2021\nSHS Web of Conferences 113 , 00019 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202111300019\n5\nof the teacher and students, there is the po ssibility of assessment and self -assessment in \npairs and small groups. Moreover, such interaction provides an individual approach to \nteaching a foreign language and allows you to receive feedback from a teacher, student or \ngroup of students, contributing to the choice of correct answers and solutions. \nAmong the differences between Zoom and Webinar.ru, one can note the need to install \na program or application on the user's device and limit free access and the number of \nparticipants in the video conference in  the free version. Therefore, depending on the format \nof the intermediate or final certification, as well as the number of its participants, the \nteacher himself determines the most suitable mode and online platform for interacting with \nstudents. \nThe increa sed interest in the capabilities of digital tools pushed developers to expand \nthe functionality, which has a positive impact on the technological qualities at the moment. \nAccording to analyze of presented tools in Table 1 used in the system of teaching Eng lish, \nwe underline the following advantages: \n- free access to teaching materials both obligatory (within obligatory teaching \nminimum) and optional ones, e.g. audio and video, moreover, all teaching materials are \navailable anywhere, at any time; \n- a possibility  of the constant interaction and experience exchange with other \nstudents and a full time classroom teacher; \n- portability, it being the principal advantage, because almost all personal electronic \ndevices are compact, light and available, they enable students  to make notes and enter any \ndata in a device directly; \n- a personal device increases students’ incentive because they are keen on different \ngadgets and use them constantly; \n- students can approach their teacher outside the classroom; \n- students can work at their own pace. \nHowever, we cannot help but noticing some drawbacks, mainly concerning platforms \nmaintenance: \n- the resolution of a personal device screen (it can be low); \n- the impossibility of continuous work in the platform because of rapid discharging \nof a device; \n- the lack of software power to enclose some teaching materials; \n- the Internet problems connected with its access, including restrictions which a \nprovider gives for the mobile communication. \nTo sum up, in spite of a number of advantages and disadvantages  of digital platforms \nand tools, they provide a range of functional possibilities that meet requirements in terms of \nthe system of teaching English. Using digital platforms and tools make it possible to \nintegrate audio and video contact for all participant s of educational process and support \nsuch activities as dialogues, asking questions, conducting disputes, organizing discussions. \nThe teacher acts as a moderator of online classes, which simulate as much as possible live \ncommunication, thus contributing to classes interaction productivity and effectiveness. \n3 Conclusions \nIn conclusion we’d like to underline that the educational process in the system of teaching \nEnglish can be carried out by means of such digital platforms as Zoom, Skype, Webinar \nand Discord effectively. \nOn the one hand, these platforms have a number of similar features, including the \npossibility of audio and video communication, chatting, screen sharing and the use of \ninteractive gestures. On the other hand, they differ in a number of positi ons, namely, the \nneed to install the program / application on the user's device, the restriction of free access, \nICTP 2021\nSHS Web of Conferences 113 , 00019 (2021) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202111300019\n6\nthe possibility of video recording, the presence of a waiting room, the ability to work in \nseparate session rooms and integration with the cale ndar. Undoubtedly, the choice of a \nspecific tool will be determined by the technical and financial possibilities of the \neducational institution, as well as teacher’s goals and experience. \nMoreover, digital platforms for providing online communication in au dio and video \nway in a technogenic educational environment support the educational process. By \nimitating live communication, Zoom, Skype, Webinar and Discord allow us to implement \nEnglish learning as close as possible to the traditional way, providing part icipants with \nsupport and a variety of forms of feedback from the teacher and other students, regardless \nof geographic position. Classes in a technogenic educational environment based on digital \nplatforms and tools support the systematic and methodological  assistance of the educational \nprocess, including interaction and students’ results monitoring which makes it possible to \nregister indicators of students' progress in terms of a learner -centered approach in the \nsystem of teaching English. \nReferences \n1.
