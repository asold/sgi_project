One critical design consideration for many heat-treatable alloys deriving supe-\nrior properties from precipitation are phases as key microstructure constituents because they can have a decisive impact on \nthe engineering properties of alloys. Here, we present a computational framework for high-throughput extraction of phases \nand their impact on properties from scientific papers. Our framework includes transformer-based and large language models \nto identify sentences with phase-property information in papers, recognize phase and property entities, and extract phase-\nproperty relationships and their “sentiment.” We demonstrate the application of our framework on aluminum alloys, for \nwhich we build a database of 7,675 phase–property relationships extracted from a corpus of almost 5000 full-text papers. \nWe comment on the extracted relationships based on common metallurgical knowledge.\nKeywords Natural language processing · Large language models · Aluminum alloys · Phase–property relationship\nIntroduction\nGlobal demand for metals is expected to increase two to \nsixfold by 2100 [1–3]. This is especially true for aluminum \nas there is a growing demand for high-performance, light-\nweight, recyclable structural alloys across industries [4 , 5]. \nIn the context of recycling, shifts in end-uses lead to uncer-\ntainties in the future scrap stream compositions, which is \nfurther exacerbated by accumulation of detrimental elements \nas alloys are recycled [6]. For example, increasing recycling \ncontent often leads to the emergence of phases (e.g., iron-\ncontaining intermetallics) detrimental to mechanical and \nother properties [7, 8].\nUnderstanding microstructure–property relationships is \nthe foundation for any alloy design effort (including recy -\nclability considerations). Microstructure constituents of \nspecial interest in aluminum alloys are phases—spatial \nregions of uniform crystal structure and chemistry. Many \nbeneficial properties are achieved based on the formation \nof desirable phases, for example, in the form of fine pre-\ncipitates [9]. Conversely, many performance characteristics \nsharply deteriorate in the presence of phases with undesir -\nable size or morphology. Given the importance of phases as \nkey microstructure constituents, a large body of work has \nbeen dedicated to experimental observation of phase forma-\ntion in response to metallurgical processing. Systematically \norganizing the knowledge published in the literature over \ndecades of research could greatly benefit the current alloy \ndesign endeavors.\nIn recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has \nemerged as a powerful tool for analysis of large sets of scien-\ntific texts. It has been applied to the design and discovery of \nbattery materials [10], complex oxides [11], zeolites [12, 13], \n * Luca Montanelli \n montanel@mit.edu\n Vineeth Venugopal \n vineethv@mit.edu\n Elsa A. Olivetti \n elsao@mit.edu\n Marat I. Latypov \n latmarat@arizona.edu\n1 Department of Material Science and Engineering, \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139, \nMA, USA\n2 Department of Material Science and Engineering, University \nof Arizona, Tucson 85721, AZ, USA\n397Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation (2024) 13:396–405 \nnanoparticles [14], and more [15, 16]. However, development \nand application of NLP to the design of structural alloys are \nstill in early stages. Sample research includes the text-mining \nof millions of papers to efficiently design high-entropy alloys \n[17] as well as predicting the pitting potential for corrosion-\nresistant alloy design using embeddings of literature excerpts \n[18]. Relevant to aluminum, Liu et al. have created a labeled \ndataset of material entities from the literature focused on the \nAl-Si alloy system [19]. Their use of active learning to sup-\nplement their manual labeling of entities, however, highlights \nthe need for an automated high-throughput extraction method \napplicable to different regions of the alloy space. On the other \nhand, Pfeiffer et al. considered the entire range of aluminum \nalloy series and extracted 14,884 aluminum alloy composi-\ntions, along with 1,278 properties from 5,172 research papers \n[20]. While covering wide independent ranges and distribu-\ntions of engineering properties, their database does not contain \nlinks between compositions and properties.\nTo address this gap, we develop an NLP framework to \nautomatically extract, from the literature, phases, and their \n\"sentiment\" in terms of positive or negative impact on prop-\nerties. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform \na wide variety of NLP tasks (including named entity recogni-\ntion (NER) and relationship extraction (RE)), without the need \nfor extensive manually labeled datasets [21]. By performing \nautomated collection of relevant sentences, NER, and relation-\nship inference using transformer-based models and LLMs, we \ncreate a database of existing phase–property relationships. We \ndemonstrate the uses of this database for gaining insights that \nwe confirm against established metallurgical knowledge. We \nfocus on aluminum alloys, but the framework presented here \nis flexible and can be applied to other metallic systems. We \ndevelop the framework in Sect. 2 and show how it can derive \nkey insights from the aluminum system in Sect. 3. The frame-\nwork’s uses and implications for researchers will be discussed \nin Sect. 4.\nNLP Framework for High‑Throughput \nExtraction of Phase–Property Relationships\nIn this section, we present an NLP framework for extraction \nof phase–property relationships in alloys from the literature \napplied to aluminum alloys. We (i) collect a corpus of rel-\nevant papers, (ii) extract sentences from full-body papers, (iii) \nperform NER and extract phase–property relationships, (iv) \naggregate or disambiguate the extracted entities (Fig. 1).\nPaper Corpus Collection\nWe first build a corpus of papers related to aluminum alloys \nculled from our in-house database of more than 5.7 million full \ntexts of papers published in academic journals [22]. Our search \nfor relevant papers included two strategies: (i) rule-based regu-\nlar expression (regex) matching of words in titles and abstracts \nof the in-house database and (ii) querying the Scopus database \n[23]. In the first search strategy, we used the following five \nrules, which checked the presence of:\n• The words alumin(i)um and alloy in the title,\n• Alloy denominations in the title, (ex: \"Al6061\"),\n• Alloy series in the title (ex: \"7xxx\", \"6xxx\"),\n• Alloy names using chemical elements (ex: \"Al-Si\", \"Al-\nMg-Sc-Zr\") along with the word alloy in the title,\n• Alloy numbers consisting of 3 or 4 consecutive numbers \n(ex: \"5182\", \"A382\") with a mention of alumin(i)um in the \ntitle or abstract.\nA paper satisfying any of those rules was considered an alu-\nminum text. We found a total of 19,356 articles in our data-\nbase of full texts. To complement this search, we also queried \nthe Scopus database for papers on the subject of aluminum \nalloys. We queried papers that contained strings \"alumin*um\" \nor \"Al-\" and \"alloy\" in the titles but excluded those having \n\"-Al\" to remove papers with aluminum as an alloying element. \nThe Scopus queries provided a further 1,164 articles that that \nwere not already present in the list of relevant papers identified \nwith the regex search. Having the combined list of articles on \naluminum alloys, we downloaded full texts of these articles \nfrom our in-house database to obtain a final corpus of 20,520 \nfull texts in the JSON format.\nSentence Dataset Collection\nFrom the paper corpus, we then extract the sentences that \ncontain information on phases and properties to build a sen-\ntence dataset. We choose the sentence as the main unit of text \nbecause papers in metallurgic literature often discuss mul-\ntiple phases and properties in a single paper. Focusing on a \nsmaller unit of text reduces the possibilities of ambiguous \nrelationships. On the other hand considering larger units of \ntext (e.g., paragraph) may challenge extraction of unambigu-\nously coupled phase–property pairs and the sentiment of their \nrelationships. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the descrip-\ntion of phases and their impact on properties is captured at the \nFig. 1  Summary of our NLP \nframework\n\n398 Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation (2024) 13:396–405\nsentence level in the metallurgical literature at a sufficient level \nfor insights to be gathered. Finally, focus on a small unit of \ntext enables use of a wide spectrum of NLP tools and LLMs, \nincluding those with limited context windows.\nThe prototypical sentence that we targeted to include \nin the sentence dataset reads as \"[Phase A] leads to an \nincrease in [property B]\". Such sentence extraction can be \napproached as a classification problem, i.e., whether or not \na given sentence contains the phase-property information, \nor whether or not it resembles our prototypical sentence. \nHere, we chose BERT-type transformer models coupled \nwith a classification head to perform this task. For best per-\nformance, we fine-tuned and evaluated four BERT models: \nthe uncased versions of the original BERT [24], SciBERT \ntrained from BERT using 1.14M papers [25], MatBERT \ntrained from BERT using 2 M papers [26], and MatSciBERT \ntrained from SciBERT using 150k papers [27]. For fine-tun-\ning and evaluation of the BERT models, we prepared 2000 \nhand labeled examples of sentences containing the phase-\nproperty information. Our fine-tuning also included hyper -\nparameter optimization using cross-validation. The cross-\nvalidation scores were used as the optimization metric and \ntheir variance served to evaluate the spread of performance \ndue to different initialization of parameters. The number of \nepochs, the batch size, and the learning rate were the hyper-\nparameters tuned on a training and validation set while a test \nset was set aside for final comparison of the models.\nTable 1 shows F1 scores for each model on the test set \nafter hyperparameter tuning for BERT models. MatBERT \nand MatSciBERT exhibit comparable highest scores on the \ntesting set (hidden from models during training and hyper -\nparameter tuning). While MatBERT and MatSciBERT per-\nformed similarly, we selected MatBERT as the model of \nchoice thanks to its higher test-set performance. The final \nMatBERT model was trained on the combined training and \nvalidation sets and performed with an F1 score of 78.87%, \na precision of 74.67%, and a recall of 83.58% on the test \nset. The higher recall indicates that few undesired sentences \nenter our dataset at the cost of missing some desired sen-\ntences. However, this helps the downstream tasks by mini-\nmizing extraction and clean-up of undesired sentences.\nWe used the selected model, MatBERT, on every sen -\ntence in our paper corpus to filter out all relevant sentences. \nOur resulting sentence dataset numbered a total of 10,213 \nunique sentences from 7,763 papers that were deemed to \ncontain a phase, a property, and a relationship showing how \nthe phase affects the property in question. We observed that \nmost of the sentences with phase-property information were \nfrom the Introduction, Results, and/or Discussion sections of \npapers, which highlights in the importance of working with \nfull texts rather than abstracts of papers.\nNamed Entity Recognition and Relationship \nExtraction\nFrom the sentence dataset, we extract the entities (phase and \nproperty) along with the relationship between the two. In \nthe prototypical example sentence: \"[Phase A] leads to an \nincrease in [property B],\" we are looking to (i) recognize the \nphase entity \"phase A\" and property entity \"property B,\" and \n(ii) extract their qualitative relationship (\"increase,\" i.e., pos-\nitive). To accelerate the implementation of the NER and RE \ntasks without the need for excessive annotated data, we lev-\neraged a few-shot learning approach with LLMs. LLMs also \nallow completing both NER and RE tasks simultaneously.\nHere we used the Cohere xlarge model with 52B param-\neters along with few-shot learning for simultaneous com-\npletion of the NER and RE tasks [28]. Cohere is commer -\ncial LLM platform and their xlarge model performance is \ncomparable to the much larger models GPT-3, Jumbo, or \nBLOOM following the HELM protocol [29]. For few-shot \nlearning, we provide a short list of examples containing the \nsentence, phase, property, and relationship as an instruction \nto the model of what information to extract (Fig.  2). The \nCohere generation endpoint was prompted with the same \nset of instructions for each of the 10,213 sentences in the \nsentence dataset.\nTo facilitate relationship extraction, we have defined two \npossible relationships: positive and negative. A positive rela-\ntionship is when a phase leads to an increase in a property. \nA negative relationship is the opposite. We use qualitative \n\"positive\" and \"negative\" relationships in the literal sense \nwithout engineering implications. For example, in the sen-\ntence: \"Phase A leads to an increase in corrosion,\" the rela-\ntionship is defined as \"positive\" even though an increase in \ncorrosion is negative in the broader context of engineering \nalloy design. We limit the task to literal RE to minimize \nthe ambiguity for LLMs. Indeed, it may require advanced \nreasoning abilities together with domain knowledge from \nLLMs to understand the subtle differences in such state-\nments as \"increase in corrosion resistance\" versus \"reduction \nin corrosion susceptibility.\" At the same time, presented with \nliteral relationship attached to a particular property from an \nLLM, a human user can readily determine that a literally \nTable 1  F1 scores of the 4 BERT models tested for sentence extrac-\ntion\nThe 95% confidence interval was measured using repeated evalua-\ntions to capture the variations in initializations\nModel type Test F1 (with \n95% confidence)\nBERT 69.06% (± 00.77)\nSciBERT 73.94% (± 00.46)\nMatBERT 77.20% (± 00.43)\nMatSciBERT 77.18% (± 00.31)\n399Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation (2024) 13:396–405 \npositive relationship with an undesirable property means a \nnegative impact of \"phase A\" on the overall engineering \nperformance of the alloy. Relationships between phases and \nproperties discussed in literature go well beyond the binary \nlabels we have chosen. While focusing on extracting binary \nrelationships from individual sentences, our approach allows \nus to go beyond overall binary relationships by analyzing the \nfrequency of positive/negative samples for a given phase-\nproperty pair. Therefore, the nuance of the relationship for \neach phase-property pair arises from the relative frequency \nof positive versus negative extracted samples.\nThe performance of the LLM was evaluated using a man-\nually labeled set of 50 sentences and ROGUE-L score, which \nquantifies similarity between two strings based on the length \nof their longest common subsequence [30]. We found that \nthe ROUGE-L score of the LLM for phase recognition was \n84.08%, while that for the property recognition was 75.86%. \nThose suggest that the model performs very well at the NER \ntask. These results were obtained using the final prompt \nwhere a total of 23 example sentences were provided to the \nmodel. Figure 2 shows three examples, while a full set of the \nsentences can be found in the GitHub repository (see link in \nCode Availability section). Furthermore, the LLM showed \nan F1 score of 89.47% on the relationship extraction task. \nAdditionally, we looked at the same metrics for a zero-shot \nversion of the same LLM, and while the F1 score remained \nhigh at 88.23%, the recognition scores for phases and prop-\nerties were much lower at 28.47% and 46.00%, respectively.\nSome sentences in our dataset mentioned multiple phases \nand/or properties. For example, for a sentence containing \n\"phase A, phase B, and phase C increase property X,\" we \naim to extract three individual relationships between the \nthree phases and the property. To resolve such cases, we \nused a convention of separating the entities with the symbols \n\" &&\" for parsing individual relationships from sentence \nwith multiple entities. This convention was shown to the \nLLM with some examples in the prompt (see Fig.  2 second \nexample). This enabled us to better parse the output after \ngeneration.\nEntity Aggregation\nOur approach with this work consisted in extracting all the \ninsights from literature as opposed to querying the sentence \ndataset with a pre-defined list of phase and properties. An \nentity aggregation step is therefore needed in our frame-\nwork to consolidate the different extracted entities into a \nsmaller list of phases and properties. At the end of the NER \nand RE tasks, our database contained 5,671 unique phases \nand 1,769 unique properties. These represent unrealistically \nhigh numbers even for all aluminum alloy series considered \nhere. Upon inspection, we found two sources of excessive \nnumbers of extracted entities: (i) imperfect entity extraction \n(false positives) and (ii) numerous alias representations of \nthe same phases or properties. False-positive entities typi-\ncally included metallurgical terms that represent neither \nphases nor properties yet were extracted as those by the \nmodel. After inspection of the most frequent false posi -\ntives, we complied lists of \"stop-words\" to remove entities \nirrelevant to phase–property relationships. The second prob-\nlem—non-unique representations—emerges due to a variety \nof ways that authors refer to the same phases or properties. \nFor example, \"al2cu phase,\" \"th (al2cu),\" \"cual2,\" \" /u1D703-phase\" \nare examples of distinct entities that all represent the same \nphysical phase, “ /u1D703− Al2Cu ”. To a domain expert, these enti-\nties evidently represent the same phase, yet they are much \nFig. 2  Example prompt used \nfor entity and relationship \nextraction. The non-italicized \nparts represent the prompt \ngiven to the model and the blue \nitalicized parts are an example \nof output to be parsed\n\n400 Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation (2024) 13:396–405\nharder for a machine to recognize as aliases. We thus aimed \nto consolidate aliases in order to not miss datapoints when \ncapturing the relationships between phase-property pairs. \nThe next two sections describe our strategies of removing \nfalse positives and merging aliases for phases and properties \ngiven the specific characteristics of their text descriptions. \nThose strategies, while developed on the aluminum system, \nare applicable to other systems with minimal modification.\nPhases\nAggregation and cleaning of phase entities was performed \nusing a series of filters to remove, alter towards a unified \nformat, and merge entities. The first step of phase name \naggregation removed stop-words and modified the entities \ntowards a unified format of phase and property representa-\ntions. We distinguished two types of stop-words. The first \nare hard stop-words whose presence anywhere in the entity \nstring indicated a false positive and thus led to deletion of \nthe sentence from the database. Examples of those words are \n\"alloy,\" \"fibers,\" or \"nanotube.\" If a sample contained the \nentity \"Al-Mg alloy,\" the phase entity was removed entirely \nfrom the database along with its associated sentence, prop-\nerty, and relationship. The second type are soft stop-words \nthat were simply removed from the entity while the rest \nwas preserved. Examples of soft stop words include \"pre-\ncipitate,\" \"intermetallic,\" or \"particle:\" the entity \"Mg2Si \nprecipitate\" would change to \"Mg2Si\". Stop words of both \ntypes were identified by manual inspection as words whose \npresence indicated that the entity was not a phase. Other \nmodifications included the proper handling of Greek let-\nters (changing \"eta\" to \" /u1D702 \" or \"th\" to \" /u1D703 \", where \"eta\" and \n\"th\" are the ways the paper database handled Greek letters \nin some of the full texts), the change to the same types of \napostrophes (i.e., removing Unicode characters U+2032 and \nU+2033), and conversion of chemical elements’ full names \nto symbols.\nThe second step included merging entities with similar \nchemical formulae. A list of formulae was made manu-\nally to obtain the most common and unified version of the \nsame phase names. For example, such phases entities as \n\"mg2al3\" and \"al3mg2\" were merged together. Apostrophe \nsymbols contained in entities (denoting metastable phases) \nwere kept to distinguish stable phases from their metastable \ncounterparts.\nThe third step was a more targeted series of similar steps. \nFirst of all, strings containing only element names were \nremoved to focus on phase–property relationships rather \nthan the effects of individual alloying elements. In this \ncontext, treating entities containing \"Si\" deserved special \nattention. In addition to \"Si\" as an element, \"Si\" also com-\nmonly refers to silicon as a phase. To isolate \"Si\" as a phase, \nwe used the presence of the words \"eutectic,\" \"phase,\" or \n\"primary\" in the same sentence, which we found to be \nuniquely co-occurring with the silicon phase (but not Si \nelement). Finally, we created a dictionary to map codified \nphase names into our selected unified notation. For example, \nchanging \"T1\" and \"Al2CuLi\" into \"T1-Al2CuLi\" or \"Al3Scx\nZr1−x \" and \"Al3Sc1−xZrx \" into \"Al3(Sc,Zr).\"\nThe fourth step was disambiguation, which, for our \ndatabase, mostly focused on the \" /u1D6FD \" phase. In aluminum \nliterature, \" /u1D6FD \" can refer to multiple distinct phases: Mg 2Si , \nAl5FeSi , or Al3Mg 2 . We disambiguated /u1D6FD phase entities by \nlooking at chemical names appearing in the same sentence \nor the paragraph containing the sentence. For example, if \nexactly one the chemical formulae ( Mg 2Si , Al5FeSi , or \nAl3Mg 2 ) appeared in the sentence or the paragraph then \nthis was used to determine the specific /u1D6FD phase. Therefore, \n\" /u1D6FD-Mg 2Si \" represents entities specifically disambiguated as \nMg 2Si . In all other cases, \" /u1D6FD \" was left to denote an aggre-\ngate of the phases that were not disambiguated even after \nlook-up of the additional information at the sentence and \nparagraph levels.\nProperties\nOf the 1,769 unique property entities, 61.3% datapoints rep-\nresent property terms encountered only once in the corpus. \nThis observation together with manual inspection of the \nextracted entities suggests that the vast majority of the 1,769 \nentities need to be grouped into a much smaller number of \nactual property categories. From the data perspective, this \ntask becomes one of clustering to find which sets of entities \nrefer to the same property and thus must be grouped. In the \ncase of properties, more semantic information is typically \navailable at the string level to warrant the use of more pow-\nerful NLP methods of aggregation that require less manual \nintervention than phases. Here, we approached property \naggregation as topic modeling. We adopted the BERTopic \nmodel [31] for the task and evaluated a variety of configu-\nrations to obtain most complete and accurate alias property \naggregation. We settled on using a seeded version of the \nmodel, which uses a list of topics and example words for \neach topic to guide the model in matching those as closely \nas possible. We used the top 20 properties in the raw list of \nproperties as the 20 seed topics. The model then found topic \nby clustering the embeddings of the raw property strings and \ncreated topic labels. Labels were further refined by manual \ninspection. Furthermore, two additional changes were made \nto the raw topics obtained by the model. First, we split such \nextracted properties as \"wear\" and \"corrosion\" properties by \nthe presence of the words \"resistance,\" \"resistant,\" or \"pro-\ntection\" to create the new \"corrosion resistance\" and \"wear \nresistance\" properties. For the second change, we subclas-\nsified every aggregate/collective entity such as \"strength\" \n401Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation (2024) 13:396–405 \nor \"tensile properties\" into a more specific property, e.g., \n\"UTS\" if the entity contained the word \"ultimate.\"\nInsights from the Application on Aluminum \nAlloys\nThis work resulted in the extraction of 7,675 sentences from \n4,891 full-text papers with recognition of 2,955 unique \nphases and 25 unique properties, which constituted our \nphase-property database.\nFigure 3 shows the histograms of the top most frequent \nphases and properties in our database. From Fig. 3a, we see \nthat the database is dominated by the Si phase that occurs \nin Al-Si alloys, notably cast alloys [9 ]. Following closely \nis the /u1D6FD-Mg 2Si phase commonly present in 6xxx alloys as \nthe main strengthening phase [32, 33]. We also observe a \nlarge number of reinforcement phases/compounds amongst \nwhich are SiC, TiB2 , B4C , Al3Ti , TiC, and Al2O 3 [34–36]. \nWe found that these phases/compounds are often associated \nwith wear resistance and thermal stability.\nFigure  3b demonstrates a domination of the property \n\"strength\" in our database, as it constitutes a quarter of all \nproperty occurrences. The high frequency of the strength \nproperty is associated with two factors. First, many sen-\ntences contain the general term \"strength\" when referring \nto the more specific properties such as yield strength, ulti-\nmate tensile strength, specific strength, etc. Second, we find \nthat the strength characteristics are much more extensively \nstudied and reported in the literature on aluminum alloys \ncompared to other properties.\nWe further analyze the phase–property relationships \nobtained with our NLP framework. Figure  4 shows a heat-\nmap of phase and property pairs mentioned in the sentences \nfor the top 10 phases and properties. First of all, Fig. 4 shows \nthe frequency of co-occurrence of phases and properties. \nFor example, /u1D6FD-Mg 2Si appears frequently with the harden-\ning property, and its metastable /u1D6FD ” variant also appears with \nhardness. This aligns with metallurgical intuition as these \nphases along with /u1D6FD ’ form during the aging process and \ntypically result in increased hardness and hardening abil-\nity of aluminum alloys [37, 38]. The Si phase is frequently \nmentioned with mechanical properties as this is a topic of \ninterest for Al-Si alloys that are often used for structural \ncomponents in the automotive and aerospace industries [39, \n40]. Similarly, its co-occurrence with brittleness is expected \nFig. 3  a Frequency plot of the top 30 phases found in our database. \nNames with commas indicate that we aggregated the chemical and \nalias names. In the case of the /u1D6FD phase, we disambiguated names such \nthat \" /u1D6FD-Mg 2Si \" only contains Mg 2Si and /u1D6FD is an aggregate of Mg 2Si , \nAl5FeSi , and Al3Mg 2 that we could not separate. The metastable \nversions of the /u1D6FD phase ( /u1D6FD/uni2032.var and /u1D6FD/uni2032.var/uni2032.var ) have been checked and are only \ncomposed of metastable version of Mg 2Si . b Frequency plot of the \n25 properties along with absolute numbers and percentage occurrence\n402 Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation (2024) 13:396–405\nas coarse Si particles are mostly detrimental to the ductility \nof those alloys [41, 42]. Furthermore, we see that SiC and \nAl2O 3 are mentioned with wear resistance and thermal sta-\nbility more than the average as these compounds typically \nimprove both properties [43–45].\nWe analyze the qualitative relationship for a few phase-\nproperty pairs. Figure 5 shows the positive (green) and nega-\ntive (red) sentiment of the top phases in terms of their impact \non a selected property indicated in the title. The dashed lines \nprovide a point of comparison showing the average positive \nsentiment for all mentions of that property. We see that the \nmetastable phases /u1D703 ’ and /u1D702 ’ have more positive correlations \nwith strength compared to the other non-metastable phases. \nThe non-metastable phases appear in a richer variety of \ncontexts including sentences on over-aging as well as dif-\nferent phase morphologies or sizes which can deteriorate \nstrength, which adds to the corresponding \"negative\" senti-\nment fraction in 5a. Corrosion resistance ( 5b) shows two \nclear extremes. Al2O 3 is predominantly regarded as ben-\neficial for corrosion resistance mainly due to its protective \nproperties when forming a layer on the surface of alloys [46, \n47]. At the same time, the /u1D703-Al2Cu phase appears detrimen-\ntal to corrosion resistance, which is due to the formation of \ngalvanic cells between the noble Al2Cu and the Al matrix \n[48, 49]. Similarly the /u1D702-MgZn2 phase is also negatively \ncorrelated to corrosion resistance. In Fig.  4, we also see a \nstrong correlation between corrosion and with the /u1D702-MgZn2 . \nInvestigating the literature shows a similar sentiment as for \nthe /u1D703 phase, the /u1D702 phase is often reported as being the cause \nof stress corrosion cracking and intergranular corrosion [50, \n51].\nDiscussion\nThe exploration of the literature on aluminum alloys shown \nin Sect. 3 highlights the retrieval of specialized knowledge \nfrom research papers. We were able to not only see which \nphase-property pairs were most mentioned, but also observe \nthe positive or negative impact of phases. The insights from \nour database and its visualization are in concordance with \nmetallurgical intuition and domain knowledge. While dem-\nonstrated on aluminum alloys, our framework can be used for \nother families of alloys where phases are important, includ-\ning new emerging alloys with less established phase–prop-\nerty relationships. Multiprincipal element alloys is an exam-\nple of potential application, especially given an explosion of \nthe number of papers being published on the topic in recent \nyears. Informing design of sustainable aluminum alloys with \nFig. 4  Heat map representing frequencies of pairs for the top 10 \nphases and top 10 properties. Yellow indicates higher frequencies, \nwhile dark blue are lower frequencies. Gray squares show the absence \nof the pair in our database. Each row and column is normalized by \nthe total mentions of the corresponding property or phase, respec-\ntively, in order to highlight trends. Without this step, the upper left \ncorner would be mostly yellow giving us no added information\nFig. 5  Positive and negative mentions for the top phases associ-\nated with the properties a strength, and b corrosion resistance. The \ncolored bars represent fractions of positive (green) and negative (red) \nmentions. The dashed line represents average positive mentions for \nthat property and the numbers on either side of the plot represent the \nnumber of mentions\n403Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation (2024) 13:396–405 \nincreased recycling rates, where multiple harmful phases can \nemerge is another potential high-impact application. Rapid \ninspection of large body of published works can therefore \ncontribute to accelerated alloy designs in these highly active \nresearch directions.\nIn addition to helping researchers rapidly navigate metal-\nlurgical literature, our NLP framework can streamline data \nextraction for training quantitative machine learning models \n(e.g., for microstructure–property relationships). Extracted \nsentence datasets can also serve as a basis for constructing \nmaterials knowledge graphs [52], which in turn can form a \nfoundation for interactive systems of fast and user-friendly \nretrieval of materials information. Our sentence dataset can \nbe utilized as information-dense source of text data that can \nbe used as domain-specific context for conversational LLMs \n(e.g., for retrieval-augmented generation [53]).\nWe finally note the key role of LLMs in building our \nframework without the need in excessive amounts of manu-\nally labeled data. Specifically, we observed a remarkable \nperformance of LLMs in NER and RE tasks using only a \nhandful of labeled examples (Sect.  2.3). The manual anno-\ntation of sentences for NER and RE tasks with more tra-\nditional NLP approaches would have been extremely time \nconsuming. Furthermore, using few-shot learning, we could \nsignificantly improve the model performance without expen-\nsive fine-tuning. The sentence classification was addressed \nby fine-tuning BERT-type models, for which constituting a \nmanually annotated dataset requires significantly less effort \nthan NER and RE tasks.\nLimitations and Future Opportunities\nIn this work, we developed a framework for high-through-\nput extraction of phases, properties, and their relationships \nfrom published literature on aluminum alloys. Ideally the \nframework should be fully automated, however, in the cur -\nrent state, some (semi-)manual intervention was still needed, \nmost notably the aggregation of alias notations of the same \nphases/properties and their verification. For example, 15% \nof the extracted samples of the property \"strength\" have been \naliased from otherwise worded terms referring to strength. \nSimilarly, our database contains the property \"corrosion,\" \nwhich aggregates not only the term \"corrosion\" itself but \nalso other related terms that constituted 79% of the final \naggregated \"corrosion\" samples. We expect that rapid pro-\ngress in NLP and LLMs will eliminate the need in these \nadditional steps and allow extraction of one-to-one relation-\nships of unique phases and properties.\nThis study focused on qualitative relationships between \nphases and properties, i.e., whether any given phase has a \npositive or negative impact on a property. Next efforts in \nthis direction can pursue quantitative relationships as well \nas additional extraction of alloy chemical composition to \nfurther aid computational alloy design.\nFinally, Fig. 5 shows that relationships described in lit-\nerature are about 70–80% positive. This indicates a clear \nbias towards reporting \"positive results,\" e.g., phases and \nphenomena that are beneficial to alloys properties. This bias \nresults in unbalanced extracted datasets regardless how good \nthe NLP framework for extraction is. The computational \nalloy design leveraging state-of-the-art NLP could benefit \nfrom a more balanced reporting of both negative and posi-\ntive research results from the community.\nConclusion\nIn summary, we present a novel methodology for extract-\ning phase–property relationships from metallurgic litera-\nture using natural language processing and large language \nmodels. The study focuses on the aluminum system and \nleverages the power of NLP and LLMs to systematically \norganize knowledge from a vast corpus of research papers. \nThe insights generated from the extracted database show its \nuse as a valuable guide for alloy designers and researchers \nseeking to optimize alloy performance.\nThe results presented here show that this framework \nis useful for rapidly extracting insights from literature on \nalloys. The knowledge we have derived on the aluminum \nsystem would, traditionally, be held in textbooks that would \nhave taken years to write by experts. As research on alloy \nproperties continues to grow, these tools will become an \nindispensable to quickly screen literature and gain insights.\nAcknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge the sup-\nport from Novelis and NSF (grant CBET-2243914).
