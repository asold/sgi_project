Different from the vanilla\n*These authors contributed equally.\n†Corresponding Author.\nCopyright © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nVOS (Xu et al. 2018; Yan et al. 2023) with only visual in-\nformation, the multi-modal VOS is more challenging and in\nurgent demand, which requires a comprehensive understand-\ning of different modalities and their temporal correspondence\nacross frames.\nThere exist two main challenges in multi-modal VOS.\nFirstly, it requires to not only explore the rich spatial-temporal\nconsistency in a video, but also align the multi-modal seman-\ntics among image, language, and audio. Current approaches\nmainly focus on the visual-language or visual-audio modal\nfusion within independent frames, simply by cross-modal\nattention (Chen et al. 2019; Hu et al. 2020; Shi et al. 2018) or\ndynamic convolutions (Margffoy-Tuay et al. 2018) for feature\ninteraction. This, however, neglects the multi-modal temporal\ninformation across frames, which is significant for consistent\nobject segmentation and tracking along the video. Secondly,\nfor the given references of two modalities, language and au-\ndio, existing works adopt different architecture designs and\ntraining strategies to separately tackle their modal-specific\ncharacteristics. Therefore, a powerful and unified framework\nfor multi-modal VOS still remains an open question.\nTo address these challenges, we propose MUTR, a Multi-\nmodal Unified Temporal transformer for Referring video ob-\nject segmentation. Our approach, for the first time, presents a\ngeneric framework for both language and audio references,\nand enhances the interaction between temporal frames and\nmulti-modal signals. In detail, we adopt a DETR-like (Carion\net al. 2020) encoder-decoder transformer, which serves as the\nbasic architecture to process visual information within differ-\nent frames. On top of this, we introduce two attention-based\nmodules respectively for low-level multi-modal temporal\naggregation (MTA), and high-level multi-object temporal in-\nteraction (MTI). Firstly before the transformer, we utilize the\nencoded multi-modal references as queries to aggregate infor-\nmative visual and temporal features via the MTA module. We\nconcatenate the visual features of adjacent frames and adopt\nsequential attention blocks for multi-modal tokens to progres-\nsively capture temporal visual cues of different image scales.\nThis contributes to better low-level cross-modal alignment\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6449\nand temporal consistency. Then, we regard the multi-modal\ntokens after MTA as object queries and feed them into the\ntransformer for frame-wise decoding. After that, we apply\nthe MTI module to conduct inter-frame object-wise interac-\ntion, and maintain a set of video-wise query representations\nfor associating objects across frames inspired by (Heo et al.\n2022). Such a module enhances the instance-level temporal\ncommunication and benefits the visual correspondence for\nsegmenting the same object in a video. Finally, we utilize\na segmentation head following previous works (Wu et al.\n2022, 2021) to output the final object mask referred by multi-\nmodality input.\nTo evaluate our effectiveness, we conduct extensive exper-\niments on several popular benchmarks for multi-modal VOS.\nRVOS with language reference (Ref-YouTube-VOS (Seo,\nLee, and Han 2020) and Ref-DA VIS 2017 (Khoreva,\nRohrbach, and Schiele 2019)), and one benchmark for A V-\nVOS with audio reference (A VSBench (Zhou et al. 2022)).\nOn Ref-YouTube-VOS (Seo, Lee, and Han 2020) and Ref-\nDA VIS 2017 (Khoreva, Rohrbach, and Schiele 2019) with\nlanguage references, MUTR surpasses the state-of-the-art\nmethod ReferFromer (Wu et al. 2022) by +4.2% and +4.1%\nJ &F scores, respectively. On A V-VOS (Zhou et al. 2022)\nwith audio references, we also outperform Baseline (Zhou\net al. 2022) by +8.7% J &F score.\nOverall, our contributions are summarized as follows:\n• For the first time, we present a unified transformer ar-\nchitecture, MUTR, to tackle video object segmentation\nreferred by multi-modal inputs, i.e., language and audio.\n• To better align the temporal information with multi-modal\nsignals, we propose two attention-based modules, MTA\nand MTI, respectively for low-level multi-scale aggre-\ngation and high-level multi-object interaction, achieving\nsuperior cross-modal understanding in a video.\n• On benchmarks of two modalities, our approach both\nachieves state-of-the-art results, e.g., +4.2 % and +4.1%\nJ &F for Ref-YouTube-VOS and Ref-DA VIS 2017,\n+8.7% J &F for A V-VOS. This fully indicates the sig-\nnificance and generalization ability of MUTR.\nRelated Work\nReferring video object segmentation (R-VOS). R-VOS\nintroduces the language expression for target object tracking\nand segmentation, following the trend of vision-language\nlearning (Zhang et al. 2022, 2023b; Zhu et al. 2023; Fang\net al. 2023). Existing R-VOS methods can be broadly clas-\nsified into three categories. One of the most straightforward\nideas is to apply referring image segmentation methods (Ding\net al. 2021; Yang et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022) independently\nto video frames, such as RefVOS (Bellver et al. 2020). Obvi-\nously, it disregards the temporal information, which makes\nit difficult to process common video challenges like object\ndisappearance in reproduction. Another approach involves\npropagating the target mask detected from key frame and se-\nlecting the object to be segmented based on a visual ground-\ning model (Kamath et al. 2021; Luo et al. 2020). Although it\napplies the temporal information to some extent, its complex\nmulti-stage training approach is not desirable. The recent\nwork MTTR (Botach, Zheltonozhskii, and Baskin 2022) and\nReferFormer (Wu et al. 2022) have employed query-based\nmechanisms. Nevertheless, they are end-to-end frameworks,\nthey perform R-VOS task utilizing image-level segmentation.\nConstrastly, our unified framework fully explores video-level\nvisual-attended language information for low-level temporal\naggregation.\nAudio-visual video object segmentation (A V-VOS). In-\nspired by recent multi-modality efforts (Zhang et al. 2023a;\nGao et al. 2023; Lin et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2023; Guo\net al. 2023; Han et al. 2023b,a), A V-VOS is proposed for\npredicting pixel-level individual positions based on a given\nsound signal. There is little previous work on audio-visual\nvideo object segmentation. Until recently (Zhou et al. 2022)\nproposed the audio-visual video object segmentation dataset.\nDifferent from it, (Mo and Tian 2023) is based on the recent\nvisual foundation model Segment Anything Model (Kirillov\net al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2023c) to achieve audio-visual seg-\nmentation. However, all of them lack the temporal alignment\nbetween multi-modal information.\nMethod\nIn this section, we illustrate the details of our MUTR for\nmulti-modal video object segmentation. We first describe the\noverall pipeline in Section . Then, in Section and Section , we\nrespectively elaborate on the proposed designs of the multi-\nscale temporal aggregation module (MTA), and multi-object\ntemporal interaction module (MTI).\nOverall Pipeline\nThe overall pipeline of MUTR is shown in Figure 1. We adopt\na DETR-based (Carion et al. 2020) transformer as our basic\narchitecture, including a visual backbone, a visual encoder\nand a decoder, on top of which, two modules MTA and MTI\nare proposed for temporal multi-modal interaction. In this\nsection, we successively introduce the pipeline of MUTR for\nvideo object segmentation.\nFeature Backbone. Given an input video-text/audio pair,\nwe first sample T frames from the video clip, and utilize\nthe visual backbone and a pre-trained text/audio backbone\nto extract the image and multi-modal features. Specifically,\nwe utilize ResNet (He et al. 2016) or Swin Transformer (Liu\net al. 2021) as the visual backbone, and obtain the multi-\nscale visual features of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th stages. Concurrently,\nfor the text reference, we employ an off-the-shelf language\nmodel, RoBERTa (Liu et al. 2019), to encode the linguistic\nembedding tokens. For the audio reference, we first process\nit as a spectrogram transform via a short-time Fourier Trans-\nform and then feed it into a pre-trained VGGish (Hershey\net al. 2017) model. After the text/audio encoding, a linear\nprojection layer is adopted to align the multi-modal feature\ndimension with the visual features. Note that, following pre-\nvious work (Wu et al. 2022), we adopt an early fusion module\nin the visual backbone to inject preliminary text/audio knowl-\nedge into visual features.\nMTA Module. On top of feature extraction, we feed the\nvisual and text/audio features into the multi-scale temporal\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6450\n“A person isskateboarding.”\nVisualBackbone\nAudioBackboneMTAModule\nSegmentationHead\nInputVideo\nInputAudio\nMTIModule𝑀\nMulti-scaleFeatures\nVisualEncoder\n…TextBackbone\nRepeat Initialize\nVisualDecoder\n…\n…\nVisualDecoder\n…\n…\nVisualDecoder\n…\n…\n𝑀\n… …InputText\nLosson:•Mask•Bbox•Class\n1stframe2ndframe3rdframe\n𝑄…\n…OutputResult 𝑄′ 𝑃\nFigure 1: The Overall Pipeline of MUTR for referring video object segmentation.

We concatenate the visual fea-\ntures of adjacent frames, and adopt cascaded cross-attention\nblocks to enhance the multi-scale and multi-modal feature\nfusion, which is specifically described in Section .\nVisual Encoder-decoder Transformer. The basic trans-\nformer consists of a visual encoder and a visual decoder,\nwhich processes the video in a frame-independent manner to\nfocus on the feature fusion within a single frame. In detail, the\nvisual encoder adopts vanilla self-attention blocks to encode\nthe multi-scale visual features. The visual decoder regards the\nencoded visual features as the key and value, and the output\nreferences from the MTA module as learnable object queries\nfor decoding. Unlike the randomly initialized queries in tradi-\ntional DETR (Carion et al. 2020), ours are input-conditioned\nones obtained via MTA module, which contains video-level\nmulti-modal prior knowledge. With the visual decoder, the\nobject queries gain rich instance information, which provides\neffective cues for the final segmentation process.\nMTI Module. After the visual transformer, a multi-object\ntemporal interaction (MTI) module is proposed for object-\nwise interaction, which is described in Section . In detail, we\nutilize an MTI encoder to communicate temporal features\nof the same object in different views. Then an MTI decoder\nis proposed to grasp information into a set of video-wise\nquery representations for associating objects across frames,\ninspired by (Heo et al. 2022).\nSegmentation Head and Loss Function. On top of the\ncomponents introduced above, we obtain the final mask pre-\ndictions from the extracted multi-modal features via a seg-\nmentation head. We follow previous works (Wu et al. 2022,\n2021) to design the segmentation head that contains a bound-\ning box head, a classification head, and a mask head. Then,\nwe find the best assignment from the predictions of MUTR\nby using Hungarian Matching (Carion et al. 2020). During\ntraining, we calculate three losses in MUTR, which are focal\nloss (Lin et al. 2017)Lcls on the predictions of referred object\nsequence, Lbox on the bounding box of predicted instance,\nand Lmask on the predicted object masks. In detail, Lbox is\nthe combination of L1 loss and GIoU loss (Rezatofighi et al.\n2019), and Lmask is the summation of the Dice (Milletari,\nNavab, and Ahmadi 2016) and binary focal loss.

The MTI decoder consists of a cross-attention layer,\na self-attention layer, and a feed-forward network layer. We\nformulate them as\nQ′ = MTI_Decoder(Q, P′, P′) (5)\nwhere MTI_Decoder represents the MTI decoder, Q′ is the\noutputs of MTI decoder. In this way, the proposed MTI mod-\nule promotes high-level temporal fusion and enhances the\nconnection and interaction of the same objects in different\nframes, which further contributes to effective segmentation.\nJoint Training for Multi-modality\nAs a unified VOS framework for multi-modality, MUTR has\nthe potential to segment video objects referred by either text\nor audio reference. To achieve this, we conduct joint training\nby combining both text- and audio-referred datasets. Specifi-\ncally, to balance the data amount of two modalities, the joint\ntraining data is composed of partial Ref-YouTube-VOS (Seo,\nLee, and Han 2020) (text reference) and the entire A VSBench\nS4 (Zhou et al. 2022) (audio reference). We sample a subset\nof Ref-YouTube-VOS for training (10,093 clips (5 frames per\nclip) out of 72,920), for which we utilize only one description\nfor videos with multiple text descriptions, and filter out half\nof the instances based on odd-index positions for training.\nFor text or audio reference, we accordingly switch to their\nrespective encoders for feature encoding, i.e., RoBERTa for\ntext and VGGish for audio. Then, they share the same sub-\nsequent network modules, i.e., MTA, visual encoder, visual\ndecoder, MTI, and segments head. By our temporal and cross-\nmodality interaction modules, the jointly trained MUTR can\nobtain superior performance on either of the two modalities.\nExperiments\nQuantitative Results\nRef-YouTube-VOS. As shown in Table 1, MUTR outper-\nforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large mar-\ngin under on all datasets. On Ref-YouTube-VOS, MUTR\nwith a lightweight backbone ResNet-50 achieves the supe-\nrior performance with overall\nJ &F of 61.9%, an improve-\nment of +3.2% than the previous state-of-the-art method\nReferformer. By adopting a more powerful backbone Swin-\nTransformer (Liu et al. 2021), MUTR improves the perfor-\nmance to J &F 68.4%, which is +4.2% than the previous\nmethod ReferFormer (Wu et al. 2022). Using a more strong\nbackbone, our method has a higher percentage of improve-\nment, which better reflects the robustness of our method on\nthe scaled-up model size. To reflect the powerful temporal\nmodeling capability of MUTR, we therefore adopt the video\nSwin transformer (Liu et al. 2022) as the backbone, which\nis a spatial-temporal encoder that can effectively capture the\nspatial and temporal cues simultaneously, to compensate for\nthe temporal limitations of the ReferFormer as discussed\nin (Hu et al. 2022). It can be observed that our method sig-\nnificantly outperforms the ReferFormer, which demonstrates\nthe effectiveness of the temporal consistency in our model.\nRef-DA VIS 2017. On the Ref-DA VIS 2017, our method\nalso achieves the best results under the same backbone setting.\nSince ReferFormer (Wu et al. 2022) does not include the\nresultson Ref-DA VIS 2017, we report its results using the\nofficial pre-trained models provided by ReferFormer.\nA V-VOS.

By employing a stronger backbone,\nwe observe consistent performance improvement of MUTR,\nindicating the strong generalization of our approach.\nJoint Training Datasets. We keep most training hyper-\nparameters consistent with our previous text-referred video\nobject segmentation experiments, and adopt ResNet-50 as\nthe visual backbone. Table 3 and 4 present the performance\nof MUTR by joint training on Ref-YouTube-VOS and A VS-\nBench S4, respectively. Therein, ReferFormer, the ‘Base-\nline’, and MUTR ∗ are all trained exclusively on text- or\naudio-referred dataset, while MUTR is trained on the multi-\nmodality joint dataset. As shown, the single unified MUTR\nby joint training can achieve even better performance than\ntheir separate training. This indicates the effectiveness of\nour proposed architecture to serve as a unified framework\nsimultaneously for text and audio input.\nQualitative Results\nThe first two columns of Figure 4 visualize some qualitative\nresults in comparison with ReferFormer (Wu et al. 2022),\nwhich lacks inter-frame interaction in terms of temporal di-\nmension. As demonstrated, along with multiple highly similar\nobjects in the video, ReferFormer (Wu et al. 2022) is easier\nto misidentifies them. In contrast, MUTR can associate all\nthe objects in temporal, which can better track and segment\nall targets accurately.\nThe last column of Figure 4 visualizes the audio-visual\nresult compared with Baseline (Zhou et al. 2022) on A VS-\nBbench S4.

Table 7 demon-\nstrates the effectiveness of MTA and MTI proposed in our\nframework. The performance will be seriously degraded from\n61.9% to 60.2% by removing MTA and MTI modules. Be-\nsides, our MTA and MTI modules introduce a marginal in-\ncrease in inference latency, demonstrating favorable imple-\nmentation and parameter efficiency.\nAblation Study on MTA. In Table 5, if either the single-\nscale temporal aggregation or multi-scale aggregation at the\nimage level are adopted, the performance of MUTR would\nsignificantly drop to 60.4% and 61.3%, respectively, which\ndemonstrates the necessity of the MTA module. We also\nablate the number of MTA blocks. As seen in Table 5, more\nMTA blocks cannot bring further performance improvement,\nsince (1) not enough videos for training; (2) the embedding\nspace of visual and reference is only 256-dimensional, which\nis difficult to optimize so many parameters.\nAblation Study on MTI. As shown in Table 6, the perfor-\nmance of MUTR is improved by using more MTI blocks. A\npossible reason is that the larger the MTI blocks, the more suf-\nficient temporal communication between instance-level can\nbe performed. Moreover, using only the encoder or decoder,\nthe performance of MUTR would both decline.\nConclusion\nThis paper proposes a MUTR, a Multi-modal Unified\nTemporal transformer for Referring video object segmen-\ntation. A simple yet and effective Multi-scale Temporal Ag-\ngregation (MTA) is introduced for multi-modal references\nto explore low-level multi-scale visual information in video-\nlevel. Besides, the high-level Multi-object Temporal Interac-\ntion (MTI) is designed for inter-frame feature communication\nto achieve temporal correspondence between the instance-\nlevel across the entire video. Aided by the MTA and MTI, our\nMUTR achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three R-\nVOS/A V-VOS benchmarks compared to previous solutions.\nWe hope the MTA and MTI will help ease the future study\nof multi-modal VOS and related tasks (e.g., referring video\nobject tracking and video instance segmentation). We do not\nforesee negative social impact from the proposed work.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foun-\ndation of China (Grant No. 62206272).
