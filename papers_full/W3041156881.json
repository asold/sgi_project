For instance, California has over 7000 MW of installed DER capacity in 2015 and has\nset a target to integrate 12000 MW of DERs by 2020 (Federal Energy and Regulatory Commission,\n2018). RESs, including solar photovoltaic, wind turbines, etc. provide opportunities for operators\nto improve power quality, enhance power system resilience, and help meet green energy goals.\nHowever, with the rapid-pace installation of RESs, the operation of power systems also encounters\nchallenges (Seguin et al., 2016). For example, since the operating conditions of RESs vary much\nfaster than the traditional generators and loads, distribution systems may experience wider voltage\nvariations during a 1-day operation compared with conventional power systems with limited RESs,\nand the distribution systems may also experience bidirectional power ﬂow. Another challenge is\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 1 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 150\nfenrg-08-00150 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:34 # 2\nXie et al. Transformer Monitoring and Protection\nthat with RESs installed across distribution systems, the settings\nof present current-based relays do not accommodate the new\nactive systems. Speciﬁcally, these RESs will probably desensitize\novercurrent relays between substation and RESs, and the devices\nprotected by those overcurrent relays have to sustain longer time\nwhen a fault occurs. Therefore, the devices in power systems are\nimposed by more dynamics than before.\nBecause of the aforementioned impacts, there is a need to\nkeep monitoring and protect critical devices in power systems\nas to make sure they are in healthy status. Transformer,\nas one of the critical and expensive components in power\nsystems, should be protected and kept monitored. Therefore,\nmonitoring and protection of a transformer evolve to be\na signiﬁcant task in power system industry as well as in\nacademic research. This paper presents a literature review on\nthe transformer monitoring and protection. This paper not\nonly reviews traditional methods of monitoring and protection\nof low frequency transformers but introduces some promising\ntechnology such as artiﬁcial intelligence-based monitoring and\nprotection, communication assisted monitoring and protection\nof low frequency transformers as well. Furthermore, protection\nmethods of solid-state transformer (SST) are reviewed, as\nSST is considered as an important part in transforming\ndistribution systems from passive ones to active ones, while\nthe systematic review of protection of SSTs is limited. As\na consequence, the paper categorizes this subject into three\nsections: (1) Monitoring of legacy low frequency transformers,\n(2) protection of legacy low frequency transformers, and\n(3) protection of SSTs.\nTransformers are openly subject to degradation or even\ndamages because of disturbances and faults. For instance, when a\nfault or other disturbance events occur, the transformer winding\nwill be imposed by magnetic forces. If such forces exceed\nthe withstanding capability of the transformer, the winding\ndeformation will occur, and the damage accumulates. Such\ndamage will decrease the operation life, reduce the likelihood\nof surviving future faults, and aﬀect the transformer’s normal\noperation (Abu-Siada and Islam, 2012). Another example is\nthe partial discharge in the transformer. Partial discharge is an\nelectric discharge that partially bridges the insulation between\nthe conductors, creates local breakdown of the insulation\nmedium, and causes a transient redistribution of space charges\nwithin the insulation system (IEEE, 2013a). Partial discharge\noccurs in a transformer when the local dielectric medium\ncannot withstand the local electric ﬁeld. A transformer may\nhave higher probability of experiencing partial discharge when\nthe transformer ages, or after experiencing severe conditions\nsuch as lightning strikes, switching transients, internal/external\nfaults that impacts the insulation of the transformer (Wang\net al., 2002). Such impacts can accumulate and ﬁnally aﬀect\ntransformer’s normal operation or even cause damage. Since the\ntransformer can be either disconnected from the grid and get\na thorough check or analyzed by some sensors when it is still\nin service, the monitoring methods for legacy low frequency\ntransformers are further divided into two subsections, that\nis, oﬀ-line monitoring and on-line monitoring. The oﬀ-line\nmonitoring provides a thorough inspection of the monitored\ntransformer. The two major monitoring methods are frequency\nresponse analysis (IEEE, 2013b) and short circuit impedance\nanalysis (IEEE, 2013a). However, as it is impractical to frequently\ndisconnect a transformer for condition monitoring, on-line\nmonitoring provides promising solutions. On-line monitoring\nemploys limited information of the monitored transformer,\nand as a result, the results are less accurate than the oﬀ-\nline monitoring. Short-circuit impedance method and transfer\nfunction method (similar as frequency response analysis) are\nthe two major on-line methods for winding deformation\nmonitoring. For partial discharge monitoring, dissolved gas\nanalysis and on-line partial discharge testing are the two\npopular methods.\nThe protection of transformers is also a popular topic\nboth in industry and in academic community. For the low\nfrequency transformers, multiple protective relays are installed\nfor protection. The legacy protection schemes include but are\nnot limited to over-current protection, diﬀerential protection,\nvolts per hertz protection, and thermal protection etc. (IEEE,\n2004, 2008, 2019b). Some other promising protection schemes\nare also reviewed, but further tests and validations are needed.\nWith the demand of integrating RESs into distribution systems\nand the constant progress in power electronics technology, SSTs\nare considered as promising options for interfacing between\nRESs and the power grid. For the protection of SSTs, this\npaper divides those protection schemes into two categories:\n(1) With the aid of conventional protective devices (such\nas fuses/breakers, surge arresters, etc.), and (2) with the aid\nof power electronics-based protective devices. The rest of\nthis paper is organized as follows. Section “Monitoring of\nLow Frequency Transformers” introduces present monitoring\napproaches for low frequency transformers. Section “Protection\nof Low Frequency Transformers” describes present protection\nmethods for low frequency transformers. Section “Protection\nof Solid-State Transformers” introduces possible protection\nsolutions for SSTs, and section “Summary” summarizes the\nwhole paper.\nMONITORING OF LOW FREQUENCY\nTRANSFORMERS\nThe monitoring approaches of a conventional low frequency\npower transformer can be divided into two categories, i.e., oﬀ-\nline monitoring and on-line monitoring. Oﬀ-line monitoring\nprovides full freedom to perform condition testing. However, it\nrequires a transformer to be entirely disconnected to the gird.\nOn-line monitoring technology has gained increasing concern\nin recent years as it is impractical to take a transformer oﬀ-line\nfrequently. This section reviews the technology of oﬀ-line and\non-line monitoring of a conventional transformer.\nOff-Line Monitoring\nTransformer oﬀ-line monitoring approach is a mature\ntechnology. The two most popular methods are: (1) Frequency\nresponse analysis (FRA), and (2) short circuit impedance\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 150\nfenrg-08-00150 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:34 # 3\nXie et al. Transformer Monitoring and Protection\nanalysis. This subsection introduces the present technology of\nthese two methods in detail.\nFrequency Response Analysis\nFrequency response analysis is a technique that is used to\ndiagnose the condition, or more importantly the change\nof mechanical condition, of a transformer by analyzing\nthe transformer winding’s frequency characteristic. The FRA\nmeasurement provides diagnostic information, in the form of a\ntransfer function, related to the RLC network of the transformer\nunder test. Physical changes within the transformer alter the\nRLC network, and in turn can alter the transfer function.\nThe transfer function behavior can reveal a wide range of\nmechanical or electrical changes in the tested transformer. The\ntransfer function is calculated as the quotient of an applied\ninput signal X(ω) and its response Y(ω) in the frequency\ndomain, where X(ω) and Y(ω) are determined by a Fourier\ntransformation of an applied low-voltage impulse x(t) and its\nresponse signal y(t) (Leibfried and Feser, 1999). Therefore, some\nresearchers also call it low voltage impulse test (LVI) (Vaessen\nand Hanique, 1992; Wang et al., 1999). The type of FRA test\nincludes open-circuit test, short circuit test, capacitive inter-\nwinding test, and inductive inter-winding test, etc. Initial FRA\nmeasurements are considered as “ﬁngerprint” measurements.\nBaseline measurements at the factory, at an earlier date in the\nsubstation or before a short-circuit test can be considered as\n“ﬁngerprint” measurements (Leibfried and Feser, 1996; Secue and\nMombello, 2008; IEEE, 2013b).\nMany eﬀorts have been carried out to improve the evaluation\nof FRA results and investigate the impact of diﬀerent altered\ncomponents to FRA results. For instance, a transformer with\nbuckled high voltage winding is used as an example to test the\neﬀectiveness of FRA in Bagheri et al. (2012b). In Hashemnia\net al. (2015a,b), authors simulate the impact of transformer\naxial displacement and winding radial deformation on the\ntransformer equivalent electric circuit and diagnose such impact\nusing FRA. Authors in Rahimpour et al. (2003) detailed model\nthe axial displacement and radial deformation of windings\nusing mathematical descriptions in the frequency domain.\nThe experimental measurements show a good agreement with\ncalculated results. Authors in Abeywickrama et al. (2006)\nfurther build the model based on lumped circuit parameter\napproach with the aim to account for the frequency dependent\nparameters of the windings, the core, and the insulation. In\nChristian and Feser (2004), the authors discuss the practical\napplicability of three types of comparison based on measured\ntransfer functions (FRA test): Time-based, construction-based,\nand type-based comparison. The time-based method adopts\ntest results from former times for comparison. As ﬁngerprint\nmeasurements from former times are sometimes unavailable,\nconstruction-based method and type-based method are two\nalternatives. The construction-based method compares the\ntransfer functions from diﬀerent phases or diﬀerent legs of\nthe same transformer. However, its results are aﬀected by the\ntype of construction and the type of winding connection of\nthis transformer. The type-based method simply compares the\nFRA results between two identically constructed transformers,\ni.e., the speciﬁcations of both transformers must be the same.\nAlthough construction-based method has some limitations, each\ntype of these comparison methods is suited for transfer function\nevaluation. Among these comparison methods, the most often\nused and most accurate one is the time-based comparison.\nTo evaluate FRA results, some performance metrics are\nproposed. According to the literature review, three performance\nmetrics are mainly used in the evaluation, i.e., correlation\ncoeﬃcient, standard deviation, and relative factor (Wimmer et al.,\n2007; Kraetge et al., 2008; Nirgude et al., 2008; Bagheri et al.,\n2013). The correlation coeﬃcient ( CC) is deﬁned as:\nCC(X,Y) =\n∑N\ni=1 XiYi√∑N\ni=1\n(\nX2\ni\n)∑N\ni=1\n(\nY2\ni\n) (1)\nwhere Xi and Yi are the ith element of the ﬁngerprint and\nmeasured FRA traces, respectively, and N is the number of\nelements (or samples). CC is a number whose absolute value lies\nbetween 0 and 1. |CC| < 0.9998 indicates winding deformation.\nThe standard deviation (SD) is deﬁned as:\nSD(X,Y) =\n√∑N\ni=1 (Yi −Xi)2\nN −1 (2)\nwhere Xi and Yi, and N are the same as those deﬁned\nin correlation coeﬃcient, SD > 1 indicates winding\ndeformation. CC and SD criteria are adopted between the\nfrequency band 20ñ2 MHz.\nThe relative factor (RXY) is deﬁned as:\nRXY =\n{ 10, 1 −PXY < 10−10\n−log10 (1 −PXY) , Otherwise (3)\nwhere PXY is given by:\nPXY =\n1\nN\n∑N\ni=1\n(\nXi −1\nN\n∑N\ni=1 Xi\n)2 (\nYi −1\nN\n∑N\ni=1 Yi\n)2\n√DXDY\n(4)\nAnd Dx and DY are given by:\nDX =1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n(\nXi −1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nXi\n)2\n, and (5)\nDY =1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n(\nYi −1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nYi\n)2\n(6)\nDX and DY are respectively the standard variances of the\nﬁngerprint (Xi) and measured data ( Yi). The deformation levels\nand the corresponding RXY values at low, medium, and high\nfrequencies are shown in Table 1 (Wimmer et al., 2007; Kraetge\net al., 2008; Bagheri et al., 2013).\nShort Circuit Impedance Analysis\nThe short-circuit impedance (%Z) of power transformers\nis sometimes measured on-site and it can be compared to\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 150\nfenrg-08-00150 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:34 # 4\nXie et al.

It is used to detect\nwinding movement that may have occurred since the\nfactory tests were performed. Winding movement usually\noccurs due to heavy fault current or mechanical damage\nduring transportation or installation. The measurements\nare usually performed on one phase at a time. Changes\nof more than ± 3% of the short-circuit impedance should\nbe considered signiﬁcant (Bagheri et al., 2012a, 2013;\nIEEE, 2013a).\nA convenient method to measure the short-circuit impedance\nof a transformer is the voltmeter-ammeter method. This\nmethod is applicable to testing either single-phase or three-\nphase transformers. A power source is used to drive a current\nthrough the impedance. The current and the voltage across\nthe impedance are measured simultaneously. The impedance is\nthen given by the ratio of the measured voltage and current\n(IEEE, 2013a).\nFigure 1 shows a generic transformer core with concentric\ntype winding. The low voltage winding (secondary winding) is\nplaced near to the core, while it is enclosed by the high voltage\nwinding (primary winding). The primary winding is colored\nin cyan and the secondary winding is colored in red. Some\nparameters of these windings are also shown in Figure 1 , and\nFIGURE 1 |A generic transformer core and its windings.\nthey are described below. Physically, the short circuit impedance\nis extracted as (Bagheri et al., 2012a,b, 2013):\nZs =\n√\nR2s +X2s (7)\nRs =Ps\nS ×100 (8)\nXs =0.2976 Scxdx\n2\n(V/N\n)2\nhNcl\nKR\n( f\n60\n)\n(9)\nwhere dx = dc + ( wp-ws)/3, cx = dps + ( wp + ws)/3, wp and ws\nare the width of the primary and secondary side windings (not\nshown in the ﬁgure), respectively,Ps is the short-circuit loss (kW),\nS is the apparent power (kV A),Ncl is the number of transformer\ncore limbs surrounded by the primary and secondary windings,\nKR is the Rogowsky eﬃcient, and it is usually assigned to be 1\nfor most cases (Doebbelin and Lindemann, 2010) with detailed\ncalculation in Jablo´nski and Napieralska-Juszczak (2007), f is the\nbase frequency, h = (hp + hs)/2, where hp and hs are the height\nof the primary and secondary side windings, respectively, V/N\ndenotes voltage per turn of the winding. Obviously, the short\ncircuit impedance Zs is a function regarding those geometrical\nfactors such as dc, wp, ws, etc. As winding deformation leads to\nchanges in these factors, the deviation between the value of Zs\nfrom short-circuit impedance test results and the ﬁngerprints is\nable to reveal the winding health status of the transformer.\nOn-Line Monitoring\nSince it is impractical to frequently disconnect transformers\nand perform oﬀ-line condition monitoring, on-line monitoring\nmethods provide promising solutions for low frequency power\ntransformer monitoring. This subsection reviews on-line\nmonitoring techniques for low frequency power transformers.\nShort Circuit Impedance Analysis\nThe on-line short circuit impedance method uses voltage and\ncurrent measurements from terminals of a transformer to\ncompute its short circuit impedance. Monitoring of leakage\ninductance of a transformer by using measurements at two\ndiﬀerent time is investigated in Peng et al. (2006) and Hao\net al. (2010). Hu et al. (2011) further improve the method to\ncalculate short circuit impedance (resistance and reactance) of a\ntransformer. In Abu-Siada and Islam (2012), authors construct\nthe 1V-I locus diagram to provide the current state of a\ntransformer using instantaneous voltage measurements from\ntwo terminals of a transformer and current measurements from\nprimary side of the transformer. Masoum et al. (2014) further\ninvestigate this technique by considering harmonics, internal\nfault types, fault levels, etc., and validate this technique by\nsimulation and experimental studies. In Hong et al. (2017),\nauthors collect consecutive instantaneous voltage and current\nmeasurement samples from terminals of a transformer and\ncompute its winding resistance and leakage reactance.\nA brief introduction for the traditional phasor based on-\nline short circuit impedance method is illustrated as follows.\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 4 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 150\nfenrg-08-00150 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:34 # 5\nXie et al. Transformer Monitoring and Protection\nThe on-line short circuit impedance method uses measurements\nat two diﬀerent time to compute short circuit impedance\nof a transformer. The expression for a two-port network\nas a model for a transformer can be described as follows\n(Bagheri et al., 2012a):\n(V1\nV2\n)\n=\n(Z11 Z12\nZ21 Z22\n)(I1\nI2\n)\n(10)\nwhere V1, V2 are voltages at two ports, I1 and I2 are currents at\ntwo ports. By assigning V2 = 0, the short circuit impedance Zsc is\nexpressed as:\nZsc =Z11 −Z12Z21\nZ22\n(11)\nZ11, Z12, Z21, Z22 can be computed by using measurements at two\ndiﬀerent time, i.e., we have:\n{V1,t1 =Z11I1,t1 +Z12I2,t1\nV2,t1 =Z21I1,t1 +Z22I2,t1\n(12)\n{V1,t2 =Z11I1,t2 +Z12I2,t2\nV2,t2 =Z21I1,t2 +Z22I2,t2\n(13)\nwhere t1 and t2 denote two diﬀerent time. Z11, Z12, Z21,\nZ22 are computed from equations (12) and (13), and Zsc\nis then computed.\nTransfer Function Method\nAs shown in Figure 2 , as most transformers have capacitive\nbushings, transformer bushing tap (high voltage side) is suitable\nfor low voltage signal injection as an input point during on-line\ntransfer function measurement (Setayeshmehr et al., 2006, 2009;\nBagheri et al., 2012a; Hashemnia et al., 2016). Figure 2 depicts a\ntypical transformer with a bushing tap. The capacitance between\nthe bushing tap and the voltage tap stud is C1, and the capacitance\nbetween the bushing tap and the grounded ﬂange is C 2. This\nbushing tap oﬀers a reduced terminal voltage due to the capacitive\ndivider of the bushing (the ratio of C 1 to C2 is usually from 1/10\nto 1/30). As the capacitive value of the bushing remains relatively\nconstant over a wide frequency range, the actual transformer\nsignature will not be polluted or masked because of the bushing’s\nown frequency response (De Rybel et al., 2009).\nThe on-line transfer function method works as follows.\nDuring testing, the shorting plug is replaced by an inductor to\nform a low pass ﬁlter as shown in Figure 2 . The test signals\nranging from 200 kHz to 2.5 MHz are injected to the tap (De\nRybel et al., 2009). For the transformer with wye connection, on-\nline transfer function is measured by a signal injection in phase\nbushing tap and response is recorded through neutral bushing\ntap. For the transformer with delta connection, the response is\nmeasured between two phases (Bagheri et al., 2012a).\nDissolved Gas Analysis\nDissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a method to distinguish\nabnormal conditions such as partial discharge, over-heating,\narcing in an oil-immersed transformer, as a small amount\nof insulating oil under these abnormal conditions will be\ndecomposed and generate diﬀerent types of gas and other\nFIGURE 2 |Transformer with bushing tap.\nchemical compounds (Wang et al., 2002). These degradation\nproducts, most of them being gases, are entirely or partially\ndissolved in the oil, which can be detected by DGA (Duval,\n1989). The generated gases can be divided into three groups: (1)\nhydrogen and hydrocarbons, including hydrogen (H 2), methane\n(CH4), ethylene (C 2H4), ethane (C 2H6), acetylene (C 2H2),\netc., (2) carbon oxides, including carbon monoxide (CO), and\ncarbon dioxide (CO2), and (3) non-fault gases, including oxygen\n(O2), nitrogen (N 2), etc. (Hooshmand et al., 2012). Diﬀerent\ncombinations, ratios, concentrations indicate diﬀerent types\nof abnormal conditions (Singh and Bandyopadhyay, 2010).\nCommon schemes of DGA include key gas method, Dornenburg\nratio method, Rogers ratio method, nomograph method, IEC\nratio method, Duval triangle method, and CIGRE method\n(Duval, 2003; IEEE, 2009; Sun et al., 2012).\nThe conventional DGA methods are logic simple. However,\ndiﬀerent methods may obtain diﬀerent or conﬂicting\ninterpretations. As a result, some eﬀorts have been done to\noptimize the diagnostic techniques. Li et al. (2011) use a multi-\nstep logic for DGA. The results show a superior performance\ncompared with Duval triangle method. Jakob et al. (2012)\npropose an energy weighted DGA to evaluate the severeness\nof transformer faults by assigning diﬀerent weights to the\nconcentrations of diﬀerent gases. In addition, some research has\nbeen done by applying fuzzy logic and artiﬁcial intelligence to\nimprove the accuracy of DGA interpretation. For instance, Qian\net al. (2009) propose a synthetic diagnosis approach including\nneural network and fuzzy theory to analyze DGA data. Ghoneim\net al. (2016) apply artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) in DGA\nto enhance the fault diagnosis. Khan et al. (2015) compare the\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 150\nfenrg-08-00150 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:34 # 6\nXie et al. Transformer Monitoring and Protection\nperformance between fuzzy logic based DGA and adaptive neuro\nfuzzy inference system (a hybrid learning rule derived from ANN\nand fuzzy logic), and better results are obtained from the latter\ntechnique. Wani et al. (2017) integrate Duval triangle method\nand IEC ratio method together and apply fuzzy logic with the\nconcept of energy weighing to evaluate the fault type and severity\nof the fault. Wani et al. (2019) further integrate Rogers ratio\nmethod and propose a fault interpretation matrix that resolves\nthe issue of contradictory decisions from diﬀerent methods.\nOn-Line Partial Discharge Testing\nPartial discharge generates low-amplitude (in the milliampere\nrange), short-duration (in microsecond range or even below)\ncurrent pulses (IEEE, 2013a). Based on these two characteristics,\ntwo commonly used partial discharge detection methods are\ndeveloped: (1) Detection of acoustic signals, and (2) Measuring\nelectrical quantities generated from partial discharge (Wang et al.,\n2002). For the ﬁrst method, multiple (three or more) piezoelectric\nultrasonic sensors are required to be installed on the transformer\ntank in order to capture pulses generated from partial discharge.\nBy recording time of arrival of the pulse from each sensor\nand the time diﬀerence of pulse arrival between each sensor,\nthe partial discharge can be detected, and its location can be\nidentiﬁed (Judd et al., 2005; Ramírez-Niño and Pascacio, 2009;\nIEEE, 2019a). Sinaga et al. (2012) describe and compare three\nways to determine the time diﬀerence of pulse arrivals from\ndiﬀerent sensors. Speciﬁcally, the time diﬀerence of pulse arrivals\ncan be determined by (1) the time diﬀerence of the ﬁrst peak from\ndiﬀerent sensors, (2) analysing the cross-correlation between\nsignals from diﬀerent sensors, and (3) examining the cumulative\nenergy of the signals. The results show the highest accuracy is\nobtained from the ﬁrst way of determining the signal arrival time.\nThe second method is to measure electrical quantities\ngenerated from partial discharge by a partial discharge detector.\nThe basic idea is to detect the high-frequency low-amplitude\ndisturbances on the applied voltage and current waveform\nby measuring the applied waveform (Wang et al., 2002).\nElectrical partial discharge signals are usually measured from\nthe bushing tap. According to IEEE (2010), three major circuit\ncomponents are required: (1) Coupling unit, which captures the\npartial discharge signals from the terminals of the monitored\ntransformer, (2) measuring instrument, which processes the\ncaptured partial discharge signals and evaluates the apparent\ncharge level, and (3) associated high-voltage and low-voltage\nleads and measuring cables. An example of partial discharge\nmeasuring circuit is depicted in Figure 3, where a coupling unit\n(measuring impedance), a measuring instrument, and measuring\ncables are shown. The coupling unit, usually containing a\nmeasuring impedance and a coupling capacitor, serves as a\nhigh-pass ﬁlter that ﬁlters out the low-frequency test signals\nand transfers the high-frequency partial discharge signals to the\npartial discharge measuring instrument through the cable (IEEE,\n2013a). Note that if the measuring circuit is connected to the\ncapacitive-graded bushing as shown in Figure 3, the capacitance\nC1 (shown in Figure 3 ) may substitute the coupling capacitor\nin the coupling unit (i.e., no coupling capacitor is required in\nthe coupling unit).\nOther Methods\nVibration Method\nVibration monitoring is introduced as an on-line monitoring\nmethod in García et al. (2005c). Studies show that the transformer\ntank vibration depends on voltage square and current square.\nThe main harmonic of the vibration is 100Hz and its multiples\nif the base frequency is 50Hz (García et al., 2005a,b). An\nexample in García et al. (2005b) tests the vibration method\non a healthy transformer and a winding deformed transformer,\nand noticeable harmonics diﬀerences are captured between these\ntwo transformers. Therefore, the vibration method is considered\nto be one of on-line monitoring methods, especially for the\nmonitoring of transformer’s winding deformation. However,\nsince the vibration method is derived from the mathematical\nmodel considering critical parameters of the transformer, the\nperformance of the vibration method could also be aﬀected by\nsome other external factors. In addition, as any part/accessory of\na transformer could contribute to the vibration harmonics, and\nthe vibration test could also be aﬀected by the dynamics in the\ntransformer from the grid, the interpretation of the vibration test\nresults is diﬃcult (Bagheri et al., 2012a).\nCurrent Deformation Coeﬃcient Method\nThis method superimposes a high frequency sinusoidal voltage\non the power frequency voltage across the monitored winding.\nUnlike the transfer function method, high frequency components\nof the currents at line-end and neutral-end of the monitored\nwinding are measured using isolated precision current probes\nand a digital ﬁltering technique. Note that since the imposed\nhigh frequency voltage is maintained constant, ﬁngerprint\nmeasurements are ﬁrst obtained when the winding is healthy.\nCurrent Deviation Coeﬃcient ( CDC), derived based on the\nmeasurements, is used as an eﬀective indicator of deformation.\nCDC is calculated as follows:\nCDC =log10\n(\nI1H −I\n′\n1H\nI2H −I\n′\n2H\n)\n(14)\nwhere I1H and I2H are ﬁngerprint values of measured terminal\ncurrents (line-end and neutral-end) at the selected high\nfrequency, and I\n′\n1H and I\n′\n2H are terminal current values after\ndeformation (Joshi and Kulkarni, 2010).\nCommunication Method\nCommunication method (Akhavanhejazi et al., 2011) is applied\nto detect transformer winding axial displacement based on\nscattering parameters. An antenna, placing inside or outside\nthe tank, works both transmitting and receiving modes. The\nreﬂected wave from the inside of the transformer is received by\nthe antenna, and the scattering parameter is computed as: S =√Prec/Pin, where Prec is the receiving power of the antenna, and\nPin is the transmitting power. The measured scattering parameter\nis then compared with the ﬁngerprint (the reference scattering\nparameter) as to detect winding axial displacement.\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 150\nfenrg-08-00150 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:34 # 7\nXie et al. Transformer Monitoring and Protection\nFIGURE 3 |An example of partial discharge measuring circuit.\nPROTECTION OF LOW FREQUENCY\nTRANSFORMERS\nThe prevailing protection schemes applied in industry for\nprotection of low frequency transformers include but are\nnot limited to over-current protection, diﬀerential protection,\nvolts per hertz protection, and thermal protection, etc. These\nprotection schemes need a large amount of settings, and\nthey need to coordinate with each other. All of these\nprotection schemes constitute the whole protection scheme for\na transformer. This section ﬁrst introduces these prevailing\nprotection schemes in industry, follows some other promising\nprotection schemes under development.\nOver-Current Protection\nTransformer over-current protection uses fuses or over-current\nor directional over-current relays to achieve its protection\nscheme. A speciﬁc over-current protection scheme depends on\nthe interrupting devices (i.e., breakers, fuses, etc.), enabling the\nprotected transformer to disconnect from the grid. The response\nof the time of over-current relays is expressed with analytical\nequations (IEEE, 2019b):\nt (I) = A\nMp −1 +B (15)\nwhere M is the multiples of pickup current (I input/Ipickup, Ipichup\nis the relay current set point), A, B, p are constants chosen\nto provide the selected curve characteristics of the analytical\nequation. Over-current protection is a straightforward protection\nscheme. However, it is only able to detect some signiﬁcant\nfaults that cause high currents. As a result, it is not able to\ndetect faults that cause relatively small changes in currents,\nsuch as inter-turn faults. In addition, it may mis-operate during\ntransformer energization, since high-magnitude inrush currents\noccur in this condition.\nDifferential Protection\nDiﬀerential protection is the most widely applied protection\nscheme for low frequency transformer protection, and it is able\nto detect internal faults such as short circuit between windings.\nA typical diﬀerential protection for a single-phase transformer\nis shown in Figure 4, where two current transformers (CTs) are\ninstalled at the two terminals of the protected transformer. The\ndiﬀerential relay processes the data from CTs and performs the\nprotection logic. Considering the transformer turn ratio to be\nN1:N2, the ratios of two CTs to be 1: N1 and 1:N2, and currents\nfrom two terminals as I1 and I2. The basic idea of the diﬀerential\nprotection is to apply Kirchhoﬀ ’s current law and compute the\nsum of the currents ( N1I1 −N2I2) ﬂowing into the transformer\nfrom the two terminals. Since the ratio between currents from\nthe two terminals is approximately equal to the turn ratio of the\ntransformer, the sum of the currents is at a very low value during\nnormal operation, while it will be a high value when an internal\nfault occurs. This is used as an indicator of an internal fault of the\ntransformer. However, because of variable taps in the transformer\nand the instrumentation errors, the sum of the currents is not\nstrictly equal to zero in practical cases. To solve this problem,\npercentage diﬀerential relays are developed. This kind of relays\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 150\nfenrg-08-00150 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:34 # 8\nXie et al. Transformer Monitoring and Protection\nFIGURE 4 |A typical differential relay protection for a single-phase transformer.\nadd a restraining quantity IR, and the trip logic is modiﬁed as\n(IEEE, 2008):\nIo > IR (16)\nwhere Io = N1I1-N2I2. Diﬀerent alternatives are used to represent\nIR, one of them is: IR =k|N1I1 +N2I2|, where k is a constant.\nAdditional restraints such as harmonic restraints are added to\nthe diﬀerential protection to avoid undesired tripping due to the\ninrush currents when a transformer is energized. A typical trip\nlogic is (IEEE, 2008):\n|Io|> s |IR|+k2 |Ih2|+k3 |Ih3|+··· (17)\nwhere Ih2, Ih3, . . .are the second-, third-, and higher harmonic\ncomponents of the operating current, k2, k3, . . .are constants\nof proportionality, s is the slope of the percentage diﬀerential\ncharacteristics. The second-harmonic restraint method, which\nchecks if the ratio between the second-harmonic component and\nthe operating current is over a set point, is the most common\none (Hamilton, 2013), and it is developed based on the studies\nindicating the second-harmonic component in inrush current is\nmuch higher than that from a fault current (Fan et al., 2015).\nNegative sequence diﬀerential protection is another kind of\ndiﬀerential protection that protects inter-turn faults (Kasztenny\net al., 2015), as the regular diﬀerential protection is not able to\ndetect this kind of faults.\nVolts per Hertz Protection\nLow frequency transformers are designed to operate near the\nsaturation knee of the core during the normal operation. As\nthe magnetic ﬂux is proportional to the voltage and inversely\nproportional to the frequency (Guzman et al., 2001), any\nsituations impacting voltage and frequency of the transformer\nsuch as voltage increase, frequency decrease, increase of the\nratio of voltage over frequency lead to saturable core, which\ngenerates excessive heat and results in temperature rise in the\ntransformer and eventually transformer failure. Overexcitation,\nthe major situation for this protection scheme, can damage the\ntransformer without any intervention. Speciﬁcally, overexcitation\nleads to excessive core ﬂux because of saturable core, which\nresults in iron burning. In addition, as the normal magnetic iron\npath saturates, the ﬂux starts to ﬂow through leakage paths that\nare not designed to carry it, and cause damage (Mozina, 2011).\nA typical volts per hertz relay is with an inverse characteristic,\nsimilar as the characteristic curve of an over-current relay (IEEE,\n2004). As this protection scheme is mainly for overexcitation\nsituation, it is limited in under-excitation condition. Apparently,\nadditional protection schemes are required to coordinate this\nprotection scheme.\nThermal Protection\nTransformers may overheat due to the high ambient\ntemperatures, failure of cooling system, external fault not\ncleared promptly, overload, abnormal system conditions such\nas low frequency, high voltage, non-sinusoidal load current,\nand phasor-voltage unbalance, etc. (IEEE, 2008). The overheat\ndeteriorates insulation life of a transformer and may also release\ngas bubbles that lower the dielectric strength of the oil. Presently,\nseveral methods for monitoring transformers are available to help\nprotect against thermal overload and failure. Some commonly\nused devices are: Oil and embedded temperature sensors, liquid\nover-temperature detectors, winding over-temperature detectors,\ngas accumulation relays, etc. (Swift et al., 2001). Thermal\nprotection is also straightforward, but it may react too late since\nit needs the occurrence of the overheat condition.\nCommunication Assisted Protection\nWith advanced communication protocols (IEC 61850) and\nhigh-sampling rate data acquisition systems such as merging\nunits, communication assisted protection of transformer is also\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 150\nfenrg-08-00150 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:34 # 9\nXie et al. Transformer Monitoring and Protection\nevolving. Merging units collect data from CT/PT (potential\ntransformer) and transmit high-sampling rate GPS-synchronized\nsampled value data through ethernet network via IEC 61850-9-\n2 (Aftab et al., 2020). The introduction of such data acquisition\nsystems separates the data processing part from traditional\nrelays, and as a result, more freedom is provided to analyze the\ncollected data. Ingram et al. (2013) test and validate transformer\ndiﬀerential protection with merging units and IEC 61850\nprotocol. Gaouda et al. (2016) test merging units communicating\nwith SCADA system over ethernet and WiFi-5 GHz links.\nFurthermore, the authors in this paper also demonstrate that\nmerging units can also operate standalone and report limited\nsituational awareness features with the high-sampling rate data.\nOther communication methods that assist monitoring and\nprotection of transformers are also introduced in the literature.\nFor instance, the authors in Duong et al. (2019) introduce a meter\ndata management system that collects the operating parameters\nof distribution transformers from IEDs via 3G modem.\nOther Protection Schemes\nWavelet-Based Protection\nWavelet-based diﬀerential protection scheme is one of the\npromising options for power transformer protection. The wavelet\ndecomposition breaks up the energy of the signals into both\ntime and frequency, allowing for a more complete and eﬃcient\ndescription of each signal. By selecting good mother wavelet,\nthis method emphasizes the diﬀerence between fault and inrush\ncurrents, since their energy distribution in time and frequency\nis diﬀerent (Gomez-Morante and Nicoletti, 1999). Saleh and\nRahman (2005) propose a two-level resolution wavelet packet\ntransform that extracts certain features of the diﬀerential currents\nto distinguish between the magnetizing inrush currents and\ndiﬀerent internal fault currents. Medeiros and Costa (2017)\nfurther add external faults detection and CT saturation modules\nin their wavelet-based protection schemes to block tripping\nduring external faults but trip the protected transformer during\nthe internal faults or cross-country faults (an external fault\nclose to the protected transformer followed by an internal\nfault). However, the performance of wavelet-based methods is\ndependent upon mother wavelet selections and in general these\nmethods require much more development to understand their\nperformance in transformer protection.\nDynamic State Estimation Based Protection\nDynamic state estimation based protection utilizes all the\navailable measurements and considers full dynamics in the\ntransformer by checking whether these redundant measurements\nare consistent with the dynamic model of the protected\ntransformer. High sampling rate measurement sensors (e.g.,\nmerging unit, etc.) are used to capture full dynamics in the\nprotected transformer in this protection scheme. Fan et al.\n(2015) and Meliopoulos et al. (2016) apply a dynamic state\nestimation technique (Liu et al., 2020) on transformer protection\nand compare the performance of this technique with other\ntraditional protection schemes. Their results show that this\ntechnique is able to prevent mis-operations caused by harmonics\nand inrush currents when the transformer is energized. In Vasios\net al. (2019), a transformer with saturable core case is further\ninvestigated to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed\ndynamic state estimation based protection scheme. The results\nin Vasios et al. (2019) indicate that the proposed protection\nscheme is able to ignore external faults and identify internal\nfaults. In addition, a cross-country fault is also tested in this\npaper, and the dynamic state estimation based protection does\nnot trip for the external fault while maintaining its ability to\ndetect any internal faults that may happen. Xie et al. (2019)\ninvestigates the application of dynamic state estimation on\nthe unit protection, i.e., a protection zone containing multiple\ndevices. A transformer-and-cable unit is demonstrated as an\nexample. The protection algorithm in this paper is able to not\nonly detect internal faults and ignore external faults but identify\nthe faulted component in the protected unit as well. However,\nthis type of method needs high-ﬁdelity model of the protected\ntransformer. More experimental tests are needed to substantiate\nits eﬀectiveness.\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence-Based Protection\nArtiﬁcial intelligence-based methods such as ANN are also\nattempted in transformer protection. An ANN is a mathematical\nmodel that is based on the architecture and functionality of\nbiological neural networks. The element building unit of an ANN\nis the neuron. The ANN is formulated by organizing a number of\nneurons in several layers. For instance, an ANN based adaptive\ndiﬀerential relay is proposed in Ahmad et al. (2019). The ANN is\ntrained to adapt the energization situation so that the proposed\nrelay will not mis-operate during the energization. Afrasiabi et al.\n(2019) integrate an accelerated convolutional neural network\ninto transformer diﬀerential protection, which discriminates\ninternal faults from energization condition. Bagheri et al.\n(2017) use wavelet transform technique to extract the features\nfrom diﬀerential current data and then train the decision tree\nclassiﬁers and ANN by these extracted feature data. The proposed\nalgorithm aims to classify winding mechanical defects, electrical\nfaults, and inrush currents in a good precision. However,\nthe artiﬁcial intelligence-based methods usually need a large\ndataset for training. And such dataset may not cover all the\ncases of transformer protection. In general, more experimental\ntests or ﬁeld tests are needed to prove the eﬀectiveness of\nthis type of method.\nPROTECTION OF SOLID-STATE\nTRANSFORMERS\nThe concept of SST was discussed starting from 1970s (Brooks,\n1980). Together with the demand of integrating renewable energy\nresources into distribution systems and the constantly progress in\npower electronics technology, SSTs are considered as promising\noptions for interfacing between diﬀerent voltage levels, usually\nbetween medium voltage level and low voltage level, in power\nsystems. As shown in Figure 5 , an SST consists of an AC\nto DC converter, a DC to AC converter, and a DC to DC\ndual active bridge containing a high frequency transformer. SST\ntransforms voltages between low frequency interfaces via this\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 9 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 150\nfenrg-08-00150 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:34 # 10\nXie et al. Transformer Monitoring and Protection\nFIGURE 5 |Topology of solid-state transformer.\nhigh frequency transformer, and as a result, its volume and weight\nare reduced signiﬁcantly (She et al., 2013; Huang, 2016). As power\nsystems are constantly subject to perturbations, the protection\ntechniques for SSTs need to be investigated. This section reviews\nconventional and power electronics-based technology for the\nprotection of SSTs.\nWith the Aid of Conventional Protective\nDevices\nThis subsection introduces the protection of SSTs using\nconventional protective devices such as breakers, fuses, metal-\noxide surge arresters, etc.\nOver-Current Protection\nFor an SST, the typical maximum allowable over-current ratios\nare in the range of 1.5 ×for some minutes and 4 ×for\nsome milliseconds. Because of such characteristics, fuses/breaker\ncombinations are used on both sides of an SST for interrupting\nphase currents (Madhusoodhanan et al., 2013; Guillod et al.,\n2016). As the SST has limited overcurrent capability (Carr et al.,\n2013; Madhusoodhanan et al., 2013), breakers are required at\nmedium voltage side (primary side) to disconnect the SST after\na medium voltage side short circuit or an internal failure. Fuses\nact as the ﬁnal backup for protection (Guillod et al., 2016). One\nobvious drawback of the fuse protection is that it is a one-time\nover-current protection. In Karady and Liu (2010), authors claim\nthat the internal sensors in the SST are able to shut down the\nconverter by removing the gate signals in case of an internal\nfault (over-current). A typical over-current protection threshold\nis 1.8ñ2 times the rated current.\nOver-Voltage Protection\nFor over-voltage protection, metal-oxide surge arresters can be\narranged to clamp large over-voltage at both medium voltage\nside and low voltage side. Metal-oxide surge arresters are able to\ndivert large line over-voltage to ground through a low-impedance\npath (Madhusoodhanan et al., 2013). As the SST has limited\nover-voltage capability (Carr et al., 2013), surge arresters are\nalso recommended to be placed between the phases in order\nto achieve better clamping (Guillod et al., 2016). Note that\nmetal-oxide surge arresters are traditional methods to clamp\nover-voltage, other advanced devices for over-voltage protection\nare introduced in section “With the Aid of Advanced Protective\nDevices.” In addition, some literature also introduces the over-\nvoltage protection for the dc bus voltage of each module in\nthe modular SST. The over-voltage protection can shut down\nindividual modules and send fault signals to the digital signal\nprocessor for system level shut down (Lai et al., 2017). Anurag\net al. (2018) introduce protection and deadtime generation board\nfor over-voltage or over-current protection. This protection\nscheme lowers the PWM signals as soon as a fault is detected.\nApparently, over-voltage protection should be coordinated with\nother protection schemes to protect SSTs.\nUnder-Voltage Protection\nThe design of under-voltage protection scheme can be integrated\nwithin the SST. In Karady and Liu (2010) and Tatcho et al. (2012),\nthe under-voltage protection scheme is executed by blocking the\nIGBTs in the rectiﬁer of the SST, so that the SST is disconnected\nto the grid when its primary voltage falls under a threshold\nvalue (e.g., 0.8 p.u.). The under-voltage protection of SSTs takes\ninto eﬀect when a fault occurs on the line resulting a voltage\ndrop. It can also serve as backup protection for the internal\nfault of SST. Similar as over-voltage protection, this protection\nscheme should be coordinated with other protections schemes\nto protect SSTs.\nWith the Aid of Power Electronics-Based\nProtective Devices\nThis subsection introduces the protection of SSTs using power\nelectronics-based protective devices such as solid-state breaker,\nsolid-state current limiter, etc. (Guillod et al., 2016).\nSolid-State Breaker\nSolid-state breaker, i.e., power electronics-based breaker is one\nof the options that immediately disconnect the SST from the\nmedium voltage grid during severe disturbances such as short\ncircuit faults. Speciﬁcally, a fast-acting semiconductor AC switch\ncontaining IGBT switches and diodes is installed between the\nfuse and the AC to DC rectiﬁer (Meyer et al., 2004; Vodyakho\net al., 2011; Madhusoodhanan et al., 2013). During the normal\noperation, the gate signals to the IGBTs are high and the breaker is\n“closed.” When the fault occurs, with the help of current sensors\ninstalled in the breaker, the high fault current is detected and the\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org 10 July 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 150\nfenrg-08-00150 July 7, 2020 Time: 19:34 # 11\nXie et al.

Transformer Monitoring and Protection\nDC side of the AC to DC converter. These switches will open\nup and protect the converter IGBTs and diodes from the fault\ncurrents in case of DC bus fault (Madhusoodhanan et al., 2013;\nWang et al., 2019). In summary, solid-state breakers perform as\ncircuit breakers with a faster response in the protection scheme.\nHowever, solid-state breakers have their own drawbacks. For\nexample, solid-state breakers have higher energy loss and higher\ncost. Besides, the design of a protection scheme including solid-\nstate breakers is more complicated.\nSolid-State Current Limiter\nThe objective of a solid-state current limiter is to lower the\nfault current by increasing the short circuit impedance during\na fault. A solid-state current limiter can be installed at the\nmedium voltage level of the grid and can be considered as an\nelectronic switch with a varistor. During normal operation, the\nloss of currents ﬂowing through the switch is negligible. When\na fault occurs, the current limiter blocks the switch, and the\nfault currents ﬂow through a high impedance (varistor). The\nfault currents are much lower than the short-circuit current\nwith the current limiter (Abramovitz and Smedley, 2012). Some\nother current limiters are connected in parallel to the solid-\nstate circuit breaker. For example, in Meyer et al. (2004), a\ncurrent limiter consists of a simple inductance, a capacitance or\na parallel LC-circuit. Once a short circuit fault is detected, the\nsolid-state breaker opens immediately ( <100 microseconds). In\nthe meantime, the currents continue to ﬂow by going through\nthe solid-state current limiter containing reactive elements.\nThe current level through the current limiter is chosen to\nbe higher than the nominal current of this part of the grid\nbut also signiﬁcantly lower than the short-circuit current, so\nthat the remaining part of the grid will not experience severe\ndisturbances. Since the purpose of the solid-state current limiter\nis to lower the fault current, other protection schemes are needed\nin order to remove the fault or isolate the faulted component.\nTransient Voltage Suppression\nTransient voltage suppression (TVS) diodes or DC brake\nchoppers can be used to clamp the DC-link voltages. In Guo\net al. (2014), a diode bridge connecting to both AC side and DC\nside of the rectiﬁer is proposed. Under normal operation, diodes\nin the diode bridge carry only some leakage current. During\nan over-voltage fault, the TVS diodes switch on (less than 50\nns) and clamp the over-voltage to protect the device. The DC\nbrake chopper is a simple protection device that shorts the DC-\nlink through a power resistor when the DC-link voltage exceeds\na ﬁxed threshold (Schoening et al., 2011; Pannell et al., 2013).\nHowever, although the over-voltage at the DC-link is limited\nby this type of solution, the inrush currents through the ac-dc\nconverters are increased (Guillod et al., 2016). Similar as solid-\nstate current limiters, other protection schemes are needed in\norder to remove the fault or isolate the faulted component.\nSUMMARY\nThis paper reviews the state-of-art monitoring and protection\ntechnology for transformers in dynamic power systems. The\nmonitoring of low frequency transformers, protection of low\nfrequency transformers, and protection of SSTs are reviewed\nin separate sections. In the section of monitoring low\nfrequency transformers, since the oﬀ-line monitoring technique\nis quite mature, two major oﬀ-line monitoring methods\nare introduced. As the on-line monitoring methods are still\nunder development, diﬀerent on-line monitoring methods\nare introduced. The methods of monitoring low frequency\ntransformer are summarized in Table 2.\nIn the section of low frequency transformer protection,\nsome prevailing protection schemes (over-current protection,\ndiﬀerential protection, volts per hertz protection, and thermal\nprotection, etc.) in industry are ﬁrst introduced. Among these\nprotection schemes, diﬀerential protection is the most popular\none. However, each of these protection schemes has their\nown shortcomings as described in section “Protection of\nLow Frequency Transformers.” These protection schemes also\nneed to coordinate with each other, and a large number of\nsettings are required. The advanced communication protocols\nand high-sampling rate data acquisition systems provide\nmore freedom to analyze the collected data and protect the\ntransformer. In addition, some other promising protection\nschemes under research are also introduced in this paper.\nThe protection schemes for low frequency transformers are\nsummarized in Table 3.\nSince the architecture of SST is totally diﬀerent from the\nconventional low frequency transformer, the protection of\nSST is reviewed in a separate section (section “Protection of\nSolid-State Transformers”). The protection schemes of SSTs\nare still under development, and section “Protection of Solid-\nState Transformers” divides the protection schemes into two\ncategories: (1) With the aid of traditional protective devices, and\n(2) with the aid of power electronics-based protective devices.\nThe protection schemes in the literature need to coordinate with\neach other, and they constitute the whole protection scheme for\nSSTs. In addition, for those power electronics-based protective\ndevices, their complexity, higher energy loss, and higher cost\nshould also be considered. The protection schemes of SSTs are\nsummarized in Table 4.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nBX wrote the original draft. DZ and TH provided the supervision,\nreview, and editing of the draft.
