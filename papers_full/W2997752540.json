Common\nsymptoms associated with FASD include facial dys-\nmorphia, stunted growth, abnormal neurodevelopment,\nbehavioral issues, and impairments to cognitive function\n[1, 2]. The prevalence of FASD in Canada is estimated\nto be between 2 and 3% and individuals impacted by\nFASD often face substantial burden [ 3]. Evidence sug-\ngests that this population experiences lower rates of\nacademic achievement, higher rates of incarceration,\nincreased risk of problematic substance use, and higher\noverall mortality than the general public [ 4– 7]. In\naddition to significant impacts to patients ’ wellbeing, the\nannual economic burden of FASD to society is large and was\nestimated to be $1.9 billion in 2017 Canadian Dollars [8].\nStandard care for FASD typically focuses on individu-\nalized symptoms management and evidence suggests\nthat early intervention can be beneficial [ 9].

However, accurate diagnosis can be difficult\nand resource intensive to obtain. Typically, diagnosis re-\nquires a substantial battery of testing conducted by a\nrange of specialized healthcare professionals costing up\nto $5000 in 2017 Canadian Dollars [ 12]. Screening chil-\ndren suspected of FASD prior to diagnostic testing has\nbeen suggested, as a method to avoid administering test-\ning to children who are unlikely to receive diagnoses [ 13].\nHowever, screening is not without its limitations, as\nscreening tools do not have perfect accuracy, screening\nmay result in children who would test positive for FASD\nnot being recommended to receive diagnostic testing.\nAs a result, the present study constructed an economic\nmodel to assess the value for money of tools used to\nscreen children suspected of FASD prior to diagnostic\ntesting. Specifically, this study measures the incremental\ncost associated with an additional year of life with an ac-\ncurate FASD diagnosis.\nDespite the substantial burden, few studies have evalu-\nated the cost-effectiveness of medical procedures associ-\nated with FASD. Thanh et al. [ 14] conducted a modelled\ncost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of an intervention\naimed at preventing FASD by providing case manage-\nment support to mothers. Hopkins et al. [ 15] conducted\na modelled CEA of universal versus targeted screening\nof newborns for FASD. To the best of our knowledge, the\npresent study is the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of\nscreening tools in FASD.\nThe screening tools included in the present study were\nchosen from the Canadian Association of Pediatric\nHealth Center (CAPHC) National Screening Toolkit for\nChildren and Youth Identified and Potentially Affected\nby FASD. CAPHC, now referred to as Children ’s Health-\ncare Canada, is a national network that provides guid-\nance on best practice in pediatric care. CAPHC ’s toolkit\nis comprised of: i) the Neurobehavioral Screening Tool\n(NST); ii) meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) test-\ning (meconium testing); iii) the Maternal Drinking Guide\nTool; iv) the Medicine Wheel Student Index/Medicine\nWheel Developmental History (Medicine Wheel); and v)\nFASD Screening & Referral Form for Youth Probation\nOfficers (Asante Screening Tool) [ 13, 16].\nAs the cost-effectiveness of screening tools for FASD\nis dependent on a variety of situational factors, it is not\npossible that a single tool from the CAPHC toolkit is op-\ntimal in all situations with respect to cost-effectiveness.\nFor example, meconium testing is the only screening\ntool in the toolkit that is applicable for newborns when\nconfirmation of alcohol exposure cannot be established\ndirectly from caregivers. Subsequently, the present study\ndid not set out to identify a single most cost-effective\ntool but rather to assess the cost-effectiveness of the\ntools under reasonable scenarios.\nMethods\nScreening tools\nScreening tools were chosen from the CAPHC toolkit\nfor inclusion based on two criteria: i) the cost of ad-\nministering the screening tool was available or a rea-\nsonable approximation could be estimated and ii) an\nestimate of the diagnostic accuracy, referring to the\nsensitivity and specifici ty of the screening tool to\nFASD, was available or a reasonable approximation\ncould be estimated. Sufficient information on the\ndiagnostic accuracy of the Maternal Drinking Guide\nTool, the Medicine Wheel, and the Asante Screening\nTool was not identified.\nInformation was identified to assess the cost-effectiveness\nof screening tools for two scenarios. The first compares\nscreening newborns suspected of FASD via meconium testing\nprior to diagnostic testing versus no screening but diagnostic\ntesting for all newborns suspected FASD . Meconium testing\nscreens fecal matter that accumulates over the second and\nthird trimesters for chemical signatures of ethanol that can\nbe indicative of prenatal alcohol exposure [ 17]. The second\ncompares screening 5 year olds with the NST prior to diag-\nnostic testing versus no screening but diagnostic testing for\nall children suspected of FASD .T h eN S Ti saq u e s t i o n n a i r e\nthat asks caregivers about their child ’s FASD associated be-\nhaviors and risk factors. Depending on the number of posi-\ntive responses, the questionnaire recommends diagnostic\ntesting or no diagnostic testing [ 18].\nThe present study does not directly compare the cost-\neffectiveness of meconium testing to the NST as these\ntools are not directly comparable due to the age groups\nfor which they are intended. Meconium testing is for\nnewborn populations and the NST is meant to be used\nin school age populations.\nCost-effectiveness analysis\nIn the present study, incremental cost-effectiveness\nratios (ICER) are used to assess value for money [ 19].\nICER are calculated by dividing the difference in cost\nby the difference in effectiveness between two interven-\ntions. To assess the value for money of an intervention\nrelative to another, decision-makers can compare ICER\nvalues to the amount their jurisdiction would be willing to\npay (WTP) to gain or willing to accept (WTA) to forgo\nthe effectiveness outcome included in the ICER. Costs are\nexpressed in 2017 Canadian dollars and reflect the per-\nspective of the public healthcare payer. To calculate ICER,\na Markov model was constructed. Model parameters such\nas costs and estimates of the accuracy of screening tools\nwere informed using published literature, expert opinion,\nBerrigan et al. BMC Public Health         (2019) 19:1746 Page 2 of 12\nand in some cases assumptions based on approaches pre-\nviously undertaken within the literature.\nModel\nA hypothetical cohort of children suspected of FASD are\nevaluated using two versions of an economic model: i)\ncompares screening with meconium testing to a no\nscreening strategy where all children suspected of FASD\nreceive diagnostic testing and ii) compares screening\nwith the NST to a no screening strategy where all chil-\ndren suspected of FASD receive diagnostic testing. Using\nthe model, the total cost and the number of years with\nan accurate FASD diagnosis were tracked for each strat-\negy until children reached 18 years of age and these\nvalues were used to calculate ICER.\nThough quality adjusted life years (QALY) are com-\nmonly recommended for use as the primary outcome\nmeasure in economic evaluations [ 19], at present the im-\npact of an FASD diagnosis on patients ’ health related\nquality of life (HRQoL) is not understood [ 20]. As a\nsubstitute to QALY, the number of diagnoses or other\ndiagnoses based outcomes are sometimes used as a\nprimary effectiveness measure in CEA of screening strat-\negies [ 21]. This study uses years with a diagnosis instead\nof the number of diagnoses, as the former better reflects\nthe temporal nature of a diagnosis. A diagnosis happens\nat single point in time but has long-term implications.\nThe discounted present value of benefits using the\ndynamic outcome of years with an accurate FASD diag-\nnosis better accounts for the temporal nature of the\ndecision problem.\nIn the model, screening can result in true/false posi-\ntives and patients receive diagnostic testing or true/false\nnegatives and patients do not receive diagnostic testing.\nDiagnostic testing in both the screening and no screen-\ning strategies can result in an FASD diagnosis or no\nFASD diagnosis. Since newborns who screen positive for\nprenatal alcohol exposure via meconium testing do not\noften receive diagnostic testing immediately, the model\napplied a five-year lag between positive screen with meco-\nnium testing and patients receiving diagnostic testing.\nFigure 1 shows the Markov diagram for the model and\nFig. 2 shows the decision tree that informed the initial dis-\ntribution of the hypothetical cohort between states.\nIn the model, screening can influence costs by redu-\ncing the number of individuals who go on to receive\ndiagnostic testing and by affecting the ratio of diagnosed\nto undiagnosed patients, which are assumed to have dif-\nferent costs and mortality. The study assumes that a year\nof life with a diagnosis is associated with better out-\ncomes for patients with FASD than a year of life without\na diagnosis [ 1, 22]. A half-cycle correction was applied.\nThe half cycle correction is applied so that patients ’\ntransition through Markov states reflects a mid cycle\ntransition versus at either the beginning or end of the\nMarkov cycle [ 23].\nModel parameters\nHypothetical cohort\nThe present study assumes a hypothetical cohort of 100\nchildren of which 66% (SD = 1.4%) meet the criteria for\nFASD. This represents the percentage of children who\nreceived an FASD diagnosis after receiving consultation\nfor suspected FASD at specialized clinics in Western\nCanada in 2005 [ 24]. The cohort was assumed to consist\nof 50% females. This assumption was justified based on\nthe most recent study within Canada on FASD preva-\nlence, which showed similar rates of FASD between\nmales and females [ 3].\nDiagnostic accuracy of screening tools\nMeconium testing\nOnly studies that included newborns with alcohol expo-\nsures at any time during gestation were considered for\ninclusion, as some identified studies reported newborns\nwith alcohol exposures in the second and third trimes-\nters only. Such studies would inflate the diagnostic ac-\ncuracy of meconium testing by censoring first trimester\nalcohol exposures, which can be the most impactful, that\nmeconium testing will not detect. If studies reported\nmultiple criteria for a positive screen on the same group\nof patients, the strategy with the highest sensitivity was\nincorporated in the analysis. This is based on CAPHC ’s\nassertion that screening tools should be liberal in their\nselection for diagnostic testing. From the findings of a\nrecent systematic review [ 17], four relevant studies were\nidentified [ 25– 28] (Table 1). It should be noted that\nFig. 1 Markov Diagram\nBerrigan et al. BMC Public Health         (2019) 19:1746 Page 3 of 12\nidentified studies reported the diagnostic accuracy of\nmeconium testing to prenatal alcohol exposure and not\npositive FASD diagnoses. Study results were pooled\nusing a random effects approach [ 29]. The mean sensi-\ntivity was 92.4% (SD = 8.1%) and the mean specificity\nwas 51.5% (SD = 19.7%).\nThe NST\nAs with meconium testing, if studies reported multiple\ncriteria for positive screens on the same group of patients,\nthe strategy with the highest sensitivity was incorporated\nin the analysis. From the findings of a recent systematic\nreview [18], four studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy\nof the NST were identified [ 30– 33]( T a b l e 2). Study re-\nsults were pooled using a random effects approach [ 29].\nThe mean sensitivity was 85.9% (SD = 5.5%) and the mean\nspecificity was 72.9% (SD = 10.7%).\nAccuracy of diagnostic testing\nThe present study assumes perfect accuracy for diagnos-\ntic testing. As it is likely that missed diagnosis of FASD\noccur, this assumption is assessed in one-way sensitivity\nanalysis. Assuming perfect diagnostic accuracy of diag-\nnostic testing has been undertaken previously in the\nliterature when the sensitivity and/or specificity of a\ndiagnostic test is not known [ 21]. A benefit of this\napproach is that it applies a best-case scenario for the\naccuracy of diagnostic testing in the model. This can\nhelp contextualized sensitivity analysis surrounding the\nparameter. In the present study, this assumption has the\neffect of biasing results against the screening strategies.\nCost of screening tools\nMeconium testing\nA cost of $175 was used to approximate the cost of meco-\nnium testing [ 15]. This value was based on the price of\nmeconium testing charged to patients at the Hospital for\nSick Children (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and taken dir-\nectly from a previous study Hopkins et al. [ 15].\nThe neurobehavioral screening tool\nTo estimate the cost of administering the NST, the\npresent study included time spent interacting with care-\ngivers, time required to administer the NST, and an esti-\nmate of the cost of relevant overhead (office supplies,\nprinting services, technology etc.). This included 15 min\nof a social worker ’s time, 7.0 min of a psychologist ’s\ntime, and $5.00 in overhead costs. This corresponded to\nan estimate of $20 per NST administered. The cost of\nFig. 2 Decision Tree Informing Initial Distribution of Cohort between States\nBerrigan et al. BMC Public Health         (2019) 19:1746 Page 4 of 12\nhealth providers ’ time was based on reimbursement\nwithin Ontario, Canada.\nCost of diagnostic testing\nThe cost of diagnostic testing, which includes a physical\nexamination, dysmorphology assessment, neurobehav-\nioral assessment, and prenatal exposure to alcohol con-\nfirmation was estimated to be $3870 [ 12].\nCost of health services use\nFirst year of life\nTo approximate the annual cost of health service use by\npatients with FASD diagnoses, this study relies on the\nwork of Stade et al. [ 34], who report societal costs for a\ngroup of patients of average age 12.9 years with FASD\ndiagnoses. For the first year of life, Stade et al. [ 34] re-\nport a cost of $20,265 for health services spending.\nThese costs reflect health service utilization related to\nmanaging early life medical complications associated\nwith FASD such as low birth weight or prematurity. This\ncost was applied to the first year of life for the undiag-\nnosed and no FASD groups as well.\nDiagnosed FASD\nFor all subsequent years, a cost of $4346 per year was\napplied to the diagnosed FASD population based on the\nwork of Stade et al. [ 34]. This cost included doctor visits,\nhospitalizations, emergency department visits, medica-\ntions, diagnostic tests, and medical devices [ 34].\nUndiagnosed FASD\nA lack of information on the cost of healthcare service\nutilization for undiagnosed patients is often a limitation\nin CEA of screening strategies [ 21], as costing studies\nare not often undertaken in undiagnosed populations.\nAs a result, CEA in screening strategies often need to\nmake assumptions, to approximate costs for undiag-\nnosed populations. To estimate the cost of undiagnosed\nTable 1 Diagnostic Accuracy of Meconium Testing\nStudy Study Information Criteria for Positive Screen Sensitivity (SD) a Specificity (SD) a\n1.

[ 35], conducted a chart review to inves-\ntigate the medical, educational, and social services rec-\nommended to a group of 70 children assessed for FASD.\nOf these children: 45 received a diagnosis of FASD; nine\nhad their diagnosis deferred; and FASD was not diag-\nnosed in 16. A deferred diagnosis indicates that FASD\ncould not be confirmed but the diagnostic team was un-\nwilling to rule out FASD. Subsequently, future reassess-\nment is recommended. Though not significant at\nstandard levels ( χ2 = 1.48; p-value = 0.223), McLachlan\net al. [ 35] found that deferred children were 22.2% less\nlikely to be recommended psychiatric treatment than\nchildren with a diagnosis. Assuming that service use\nassociated with deferred patients reflects that of patients\nwith undiagnosed FASD and combining this data with\nthe cost reported in Stade et al. [ 34] for diagnosed\nFASD, results in an estimated annual cost of undiag-\nnosed FASD of $3441 (For further details see\nAdditional file 1). This assumption is tested in one-way\nsensitivity analysis. Research suggests that a majority\nportion of differed patients will go on to receive an\nFASD diagnosis at some point in their life [ 22].\nNo FASD\nPatients without FASD were assumed to use healthcare\nresources at a rate of $3101/year. This value was calcu-\nlated using the same method as the cost for undiagnosed\nFASD [ 34, 35].\nRate of future diagnosis\nPatients with FASD who do not receive a diagnosis due\nto a false negative in screening are assumed to receive\nfuture diagnoses at a rate of 5% per year. At present, the\nrate of future diagnosis for patients with FASD who fail\nto receive a diagnosis because of a false negative in\nscreening is not known. As a result, this parameter has\nbeen estimated based on the assessment of the present\nstudy’s authors. This assumption is assessed in one-way\nsensitivity analysis. These patients are assumed to re-\nceive repeated screening and diagnostic testing during\nsubsequent diagnoses.\nTable 2 Diagnostic Accuracy of the Neurobehavioral Screening Tool\nStudy Study Information Criteria for Positive Screen Sensitivity (SD) a Specificity (SD) a\n1.

BMC Public Health         (2019) 19:1746 Page 6 of 12\nMortality\nBased on the findings of a recent systematic review\n[36], one study has reported mortality in FASD [ 6].\nBurd et al. [ 6] report a standardized mortality ratio\n(SMR) for a cohort of individuals diagnosed with FASD\nof 3.15. Mortality was assumed to be elevated 10% in\nthe undiagnosed FASD population and to reflect that of\ndiagnosed FASD in the no FASD population. At\npresent, the rate of mortality for undiagnosed patients\nis not known and this parameter was informed based\non the assessment of the present study ’s authors. Mor-\ntality assumptions were assessed in one-way sensitivity\nanalysis. SMR were combined with Statistics Canada\nlife tables to estimate mortality.\nDiscounting and time horizon\nCost and outcomes occurring beyond 1 year were dis-\ncounted at a rate of 1.5% [ 19]. Discounting weights\nevents occurring sooner to a greater extent than those\noccurring later to account for societal preference for the\npresent. Costs and outcomes were aggregated until\nchildren reached age 18. This time-horizon was chosen\nas consultation with experts suggested that pediatric\ndiagnosis is of greater value for improving patient out-\ncomes than diagnosis in adulthood. Additionally, as\nthere are few treatment options available for adults [ 9],\nit is not clear how service utilization between diagnosed\nand undiagnosed adults would differ.\nProbabilistic analysis\nTo conduct probabilistic analysis (PA), values were\nrandomly sampled for each model parameter from a\ndistribution and then used to calculate ICER. This\nprocess was repeated 5000 times using Microsoft Excel\n(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA).\nFor parameter values that represent percentages, a\nbeta distribution was applied with mean and SD based\non literature-derived estimates. Two exceptions to this\nare i) the rate of subsequent diagnoses was varied sub-\nject to a uniform distribution over the range 3 to 7% and\nii) the mortality for undiagnosed FASD was varied sub-\nject to a uniform distribution by an increase of 0 to 20%\nrelative to the mortality of diagnosed FASD. At present,\nuncertainty for the aforementioned parameters (i and ii)\nis not well understood, the authors of the present study\nchose these intervals to reflect a large degree of uncer-\ntainty for these parameters. The uniform distribution\nwas chosen, as it makes each value within the PA inter-\nval equally likely further accounting for uncertainty. Cost\nfor screening tools and diagnostic testing were varied\nsubject to the normal distribution within the interval\nplus or minus 25% of the parameter value with an SD of\n10% of the parameter value. Estimates for costs based on\nexperimental results were varied subject to the log-\nnormal distribution with an SD of 10% of the parameter\nvalue. Parameter values for mortality were varied subject\nto the normal distribution but it was assumed that\nmortality could not be superior to the general public.\nThe SD for the mortality of patients with no FASD\nrepresents the SD of diagnosed FASD inflated by 1.25, to\naccount for uncertainty regarding mortality rates in this\npopulation. Sensitivity and specificity estimates were not\ncorrelated in PA. This may result in the model overstat-\ning uncertainty. For a list of model parameters and dis-\ntributional assumptions, see Table 3.\nOne-way sensitivity analysis\nTo conduct one-way sensitivity analysis, parameter\nvalues for key model inputs were varied by plus and\nminus 25% of the parameter value. Parameters included\nin one-way analysis include the sensitivity and specificity\nof screening tools, the sensitivity of diagnostic testing,\nthe number of positive cases in the cohort, the annual\ncost of diagnosed and undiagnosed FASD, the cost of\ndiagnostic testing, the cost of screening tools, future\ndiagnosis rates, and mortality rates. Alternative discount\nrates were assessed in scenario analysis based on the rec-\nommendation of CADTH [ 19].\nResults\nCost-effectiveness analysis\nThe model predicts that screening newborns with meco-\nnium testing results in a cost savings of $89,186 per 100\nindividuals screened and approximately 38 fewer years\nof life with an FASD diagnoses over the no screening\nstrategy corresponding to an ICER of $2359. Screening 5\nyear olds with the NST resulted in a cost savings of\n$183,895 per 100 individuals screened and approxi-\nmately 77 fewer years of life with an FASD diagnoses\nover the no screening strategy corresponding to an ICER\nof $2390 (Table 4). Alternative discount rates of 0 and\n3% did not substantially affect cost-effectiveness, result-\ning in ICER of $2256 and $2459 for meconium testing\nand $$2253 and $2531 respectively for the NST.\nOne-way sensitivity analysis\nFor both screening strategies, the sensitivity of the\nscreening tool was most impactful on cost-effectiveness.\nOther impactful parameters included the number of\npositive cases in the cohort, the annual cost of diagnosed\nFASD, the annual cost of undiagnosed FASD, and the\ncost of diagnostic testing. The impact of the cost of\nscreening tools, mortality, and the future diagnosis rate\nhad minimal impact on cost-effectiveness in one-way\nsensitivity analysis (See Fig. 3).\nBerrigan et al.

A CEAC uses PA generated ICER to\nassess the probability that an intervention is cost-\neffective relative to another intervention across a range\nof WTP threshold values, dependent on the variability\nwithin the model. In the present study, the curve shows\nthe percentage of PA generated ICER that fall below a\ngiven WTA threshold for an additional year of life with\nan FASD diagnosis. At a WTA of $500 there was a\n96.5% probability of meconium testing being cost-\neffective, at $1000 the probability was 91.2%, and by\n$3000 the probability was less than 50%. At a WTA of\n$1000, there was a 100% probability of the NST being\ncost-effective, at $2000 the probability was 82.4%, and by\n$3000, the probability was well below 50%.\nFigure 4c & d show cost-effectiveness planes (CEP).\nThe CEP plots the difference in outcomes on the hori-\nzontal axis versus the difference in cost on the vertical\naxis for each of the 5000 PA generated ICER. The CEP\nprovides a visual representation of an intervention ’s\nlikelihood of being cost saving, more effective, and cost-\neffective relative to another intervention conditional\nupon the variability in the model.\nDiscussion\nThe present study set out to assess the value for money\nof tools used to screen children suspected of FASD. By\ncharacterizing, the trade-off associated with screening\nchildren suspected of FASD prior to diagnostic testing,\nthe present study can provide guidance to physicians\nand decision-makers evaluating which tools to use and\nthe extent to which FASD screening should be under-\ntaken. Both of the screening tools evaluated resulted in\ncost savings and fewer diagnosed years of life than a no\nscreening strategy in which all children suspected of\nFASD receive diagnostic testing. Probabilistic analyses\nsupported this finding. Since diagnosis can be key to\nchildren receiving timely and appropriate health and\neducational services, cost-savings must be weighed\nagainst the fewer years of life with a diagnosis associated\nwith screening. Though not directly tested, findings sug-\ngest that screening may be an approach to optimize the\nFig. 4 Cost-effectiveness Acceptability Curves and Cost-effectiveness Plane\nBerrigan et al. BMC Public Health         (2019) 19:1746 Page 10 of 12\nefficient use of diagnostic resources in jurisdictions\nwhere demand for diagnostic testing exceeds supply.\nThe findings of the present study will have implica-\ntions for the evaluation of new technologies. At present,\nthere are screening technologies being developed that\nshow promise in identifying patients with FASD [ 37].\nThough these screening tools will enable greater accur-\nacy and testing over the entire lifespan, they will also\ncome at greater cost. Having some understanding re-\ngarding current options from a value for money stand-\npoint will be instrumental in making informed decisions\nregarding the next generation of screening tools.\nThe present study ’s model represents a simplistic ap-\nproximation of the diagnostic process for FASD and\nwould benefit from additional information. Notably, infor-\nmation on: the optimal criteria for a positive screen for\nscreening tools; the impact of an FASD diagnosis on pa-\ntients’ HRQoL, use of healthcare services, and mortality;\nthe probability of patients who receive a false negative in\nscreening receiving diagnoses in subsequent years; and the\naccuracy of diagnostic testing. Furthermore, WTP for an\nFASD diagnosis is unlikely to be known in most jurisdic-\ntions. Future study using cost-utility analysis would be\nbeneficial, as WTP for quality-adjusted life years are better\nunderstood in many jurisdictions than WTP for years of\nlife with an FASD diagnosis. The present study was con-\nducted form the perspective of the healthcare system, as\nFASD is likely to affect the criminal justice and educa-\ntional systems, broader cost-perspectives may provide\nadditional insights.\nMany of the aforementioned limitations are common in\nmodelled CEA of screening tools [ 21]. Iragorri and\nSpackman [21] highlight some of the difficulty associated\nwith obtaining cost and outcome data for the undiagnosed\npopulations in CEA of screen ing procedures and highlight\nthe need for assumptions in these studies. A key driver of\nthe lack of data is that screening can lead to missed diagno-\nses and studies tend not to be conducted on undiagnosed\npatient groups, as these patients are difficult to identify.\nIt should be mentioned that screening children in ju-\nrisdictions where there is not diagnostic capacity should\nnot be undertaken. In the event that diagnostic testing is\nnot available, screening should not be used as a substi-\ntute for diagnostic testing, as this could lead to misdiag-\nnoses and inappropriate care.\nConclusions\nScreening children suspected of FASD prior to diagnostic\ntesting was associated with cost-savings but fewer years of\nlife with a diagnosis for both screening tools evaluated\nfrom the perspective of the healthcare system. The find-\nings of the present study will be of interest to decision-\nmakers investigating which screening tools to use and the\nextent to which screening in general should be used.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10.\n1186/s12889-019-8110-5.\nAdditional file 1.
