In\nvision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or\nused to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their\noverall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary\nand a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform\nvery well on image classiﬁcation tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of\ndata and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks\n(ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent\nresults compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring sub-\nstantially fewer computational resources to train.1\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nSelf-attention-based architectures, in particular Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), have become\nthe model of choice in natural language processing (NLP). The dominant approach is to pre-train on\na large text corpus and then ﬁne-tune on a smaller task-speciﬁc dataset (Devlin et al., 2019). Thanks\nto Transformers’ computational efﬁciency and scalability, it has become possible to train models of\nunprecedented size, with over 100B parameters (Brown et al., 2020; Lepikhin et al., 2020). With the\nmodels and datasets growing, there is still no sign of saturating performance.\nIn computer vision, however, convolutional architectures remain dominant (LeCun et al., 1989;\nKrizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016). Inspired by NLP successes, multiple works try combining\nCNN-like architectures with self-attention (Wang et al., 2018; Carion et al., 2020), some replacing\nthe convolutions entirely (Ramachandran et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a). The latter models, while\ntheoretically efﬁcient, have not yet been scaled effectively on modern hardware accelerators due to\nthe use of specialized attention patterns. Therefore, in large-scale image recognition, classic ResNet-\nlike architectures are still state of the art (Mahajan et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2020; Kolesnikov et al.,\n2020).\nInspired by the Transformer scaling successes in NLP, we experiment with applying a standard\nTransformer directly to images, with the fewest possible modiﬁcations. To do so, we split an image\ninto patches and provide the sequence of linear embeddings of these patches as an input to a Trans-\nformer. Image patches are treated the same way as tokens (words) in an NLP application. We train\nthe model on image classiﬁcation in supervised fashion.\nWhen trained on mid-sized datasets such as ImageNet without strong regularization, these mod-\nels yield modest accuracies of a few percentage points below ResNets of comparable size. This\nseemingly discouraging outcome may be expected: Transformers lack some of the inductive biases\n1Fine-tuning code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/vision_transformer\n1\narXiv:2010.11929v2  [cs.CV]  3 Jun 2021\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\ninherent to CNNs, such as translation equivariance and locality, and therefore do not generalize well\nwhen trained on insufﬁcient amounts of data.\nHowever, the picture changes if the models are trained on larger datasets (14M-300M images). We\nﬁnd that large scale training trumps inductive bias. Our Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent\nresults when pre-trained at sufﬁcient scale and transferred to tasks with fewer datapoints. When\npre-trained on the public ImageNet-21k dataset or the in-house JFT-300M dataset, ViT approaches\nor beats state of the art on multiple image recognition benchmarks. In particular, the best model\nreaches the accuracy of 88.55% on ImageNet, 90.72% on ImageNet-ReaL, 94.55% on CIFAR-100,\nand 77.63% on the VTAB suite of 19 tasks.\n2 R ELATED WORK\nTransformers were proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) for machine translation, and have since be-\ncome the state of the art method in many NLP tasks. Large Transformer-based models are often\npre-trained on large corpora and then ﬁne-tuned for the task at hand: BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)\nuses a denoising self-supervised pre-training task, while the GPT line of work uses language mod-\neling as its pre-training task (Radford et al., 2018; 2019; Brown et al., 2020).\nNaive application of self-attention to images would require that each pixel attends to every other\npixel. With quadratic cost in the number of pixels, this does not scale to realistic input sizes. Thus,\nto apply Transformers in the context of image processing, several approximations have been tried in\nthe past. Parmar et al. (2018) applied the self-attention only in local neighborhoods for each query\npixel instead of globally. Such local multi-head dot-product self attention blocks can completely\nreplace convolutions (Hu et al., 2019; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). In a different\nline of work, Sparse Transformers (Child et al., 2019) employ scalable approximations to global self-\nattention in order to be applicable to images. An alternative way to scale attention is to apply it in\nblocks of varying sizes (Weissenborn et al., 2019), in the extreme case only along individual axes (Ho\net al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a). Many of these specialized attention architectures demonstrate\npromising results on computer vision tasks, but require complex engineering to be implemented\nefﬁciently on hardware accelerators.\nMost related to ours is the model of Cordonnier et al. (2020), which extracts patches of size 2 ×2\nfrom the input image and applies full self-attention on top. This model is very similar to ViT,\nbut our work goes further to demonstrate that large scale pre-training makes vanilla transformers\ncompetitive with (or even better than) state-of-the-art CNNs. Moreover, Cordonnier et al. (2020)\nuse a small patch size of 2 ×2 pixels, which makes the model applicable only to small-resolution\nimages, while we handle medium-resolution images as well.\nThere has also been a lot of interest in combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with forms\nof self-attention, e.g. by augmenting feature maps for image classiﬁcation (Bello et al., 2019) or by\nfurther processing the output of a CNN using self-attention, e.g. for object detection (Hu et al., 2018;\nCarion et al., 2020), video processing (Wang et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2019), image classiﬁcation (Wu\net al., 2020), unsupervised object discovery (Locatello et al., 2020), or uniﬁed text-vision tasks (Chen\net al., 2020c; Lu et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019).\nAnother recent related model is image GPT (iGPT) (Chen et al., 2020a), which applies Transformers\nto image pixels after reducing image resolution and color space. The model is trained in an unsu-\npervised fashion as a generative model, and the resulting representation can then be ﬁne-tuned or\nprobed linearly for classiﬁcation performance, achieving a maximal accuracy of 72% on ImageNet.\nOur work adds to the increasing collection of papers that explore image recognition at larger scales\nthan the standard ImageNet dataset. The use of additional data sources allows to achieve state-of-\nthe-art results on standard benchmarks (Mahajan et al., 2018; Touvron et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2020).\nMoreover, Sun et al. (2017) study how CNN performance scales with dataset size, and Kolesnikov\net al. (2020); Djolonga et al. (2020) perform an empirical exploration of CNN transfer learning from\nlarge scale datasets such as ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M. We focus on these two latter datasets as\nwell, but train Transformers instead of ResNet-based models used in prior works.\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nTransformer \nEncoder\nMLP \nHead\n Vision Transformer (ViT)\n*\nLinear \nProjection \nof \nFlattened \nPatches\n*\n \nExtra \nlearnable\n     \n[class]\n \nembedding\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n0\nPatch \n+ \nPosition \nEmbedding\nClass\nBird\nBall\nCar\n...\nEmbedded \nPatches\nMulti-Head \nAttention\nNorm\nMLP\nNorm\n+\nL\n \nx\n+\n Transformer Encoder\nFigure 1: Model overview. We split an image into ﬁxed-size patches, linearly embed each of them,\nadd position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of vectors to a standard Transformer\nencoder. In order to perform classiﬁcation, we use the standard approach of adding an extra learnable\n“classiﬁcation token” to the sequence. The illustration of the Transformer encoder was inspired by\nVaswani et al. (2017).\n3 M ETHOD\nIn model design we follow the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as closely as possible.\nAn advantage of this intentionally simple setup is that scalable NLP Transformer architectures – and\ntheir efﬁcient implementations – can be used almost out of the box.\n3.1 V ISION TRANSFORMER (VIT)\nAn overview of the model is depicted in Figure 1. The standard Transformer receives as input a 1D\nsequence of token embeddings. To handle 2D images, we reshape the image x ∈RH×W×C into a\nsequence of ﬂattened 2D patches xp ∈RN×(P2·C), where (H,W ) is the resolution of the original\nimage, Cis the number of channels,(P,P ) is the resolution of each image patch, andN = HW/P2\nis the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the\nTransformer. The Transformer uses constant latent vector size D through all of its layers, so we\nﬂatten the patches and map to Ddimensions with a trainable linear projection (Eq. 1). We refer to\nthe output of this projection as the patch embeddings.\nSimilar to BERT’s[class] token, we prepend a learnable embedding to the sequence of embed-\nded patches (z0\n0 = xclass), whose state at the output of the Transformer encoder ( z0\nL) serves as the\nimage representation y (Eq. 4). Both during pre-training and ﬁne-tuning, a classiﬁcation head is at-\ntached to z0\nL. The classiﬁcation head is implemented by a MLP with one hidden layer at pre-training\ntime and by a single linear layer at ﬁne-tuning time.\nPosition embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. We use\nstandard learnable 1D position embeddings, since we have not observed signiﬁcant performance\ngains from using more advanced 2D-aware position embeddings (Appendix D.4). The resulting\nsequence of embedding vectors serves as input to the encoder.\nThe Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017) consists of alternating layers of multiheaded self-\nattention (MSA, see Appendix A) and MLP blocks (Eq. 2, 3). Layernorm (LN) is applied before\nevery block, and residual connections after every block (Wang et al., 2019; Baevski & Auli, 2019).\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nThe MLP contains two layers with a GELU non-linearity.\nz0 = [xclass; x1\npE; x2\npE; ··· ; xN\np E] +Epos, E ∈R(P2·C)×D, Epos ∈R(N+1)×D (1)\nz′\nℓ = MSA(LN(zℓ−1)) +zℓ−1, ℓ = 1...L (2)\nzℓ = MLP(LN(z′\nℓ)) +z′\nℓ, ℓ = 1...L (3)\ny = LN(z0\nL) (4)\nInductive bias. We note that Vision Transformer has much less image-speciﬁc inductive bias than\nCNNs. In CNNs, locality, two-dimensional neighborhood structure, and translation equivariance are\nbaked into each layer throughout the whole model. In ViT, only MLP layers are local and transla-\ntionally equivariant, while the self-attention layers are global. The two-dimensional neighborhood\nstructure is used very sparingly: in the beginning of the model by cutting the image into patches and\nat ﬁne-tuning time for adjusting the position embeddings for images of different resolution (as de-\nscribed below). Other than that, the position embeddings at initialization time carry no information\nabout the 2D positions of the patches and all spatial relations between the patches have to be learned\nfrom scratch.\nHybrid Architecture. As an alternative to raw image patches, the input sequence can be formed\nfrom feature maps of a CNN (LeCun et al., 1989). In this hybrid model, the patch embedding\nprojection E (Eq. 1) is applied to patches extracted from a CNN feature map. As a special case,\nthe patches can have spatial size 1x1, which means that the input sequence is obtained by simply\nﬂattening the spatial dimensions of the feature map and projecting to the Transformer dimension.\nThe classiﬁcation input embedding and position embeddings are added as described above.\n3.2 F INE -TUNING AND HIGHER RESOLUTION\nTypically, we pre-train ViT on large datasets, and ﬁne-tune to (smaller) downstream tasks. For\nthis, we remove the pre-trained prediction head and attach a zero-initialized D×K feedforward\nlayer, where K is the number of downstream classes. It is often beneﬁcial to ﬁne-tune at higher\nresolution than pre-training (Touvron et al., 2019; Kolesnikov et al., 2020). When feeding images\nof higher resolution, we keep the patch size the same, which results in a larger effective sequence\nlength. The Vision Transformer can handle arbitrary sequence lengths (up to memory constraints),\nhowever, the pre-trained position embeddings may no longer be meaningful. We therefore perform\n2D interpolation of the pre-trained position embeddings, according to their location in the original\nimage. Note that this resolution adjustment and patch extraction are the only points at which an\ninductive bias about the 2D structure of the images is manually injected into the Vision Transformer.\n4 E XPERIMENTS\nWe evaluate the representation learning capabilities of ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the\nhybrid. To understand the data requirements of each model, we pre-train on datasets of varying size\nand evaluate many benchmark tasks. When considering the computational cost of pre-training the\nmodel, ViT performs very favourably, attaining state of the art on most recognition benchmarks at\na lower pre-training cost. Lastly, we perform a small experiment using self-supervision, and show\nthat self-supervised ViT holds promise for the future.\n4.1 S ETUP\nDatasets. To explore model scalability, we use the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset with 1k classes\nand 1.3M images (we refer to it as ImageNet in what follows), its superset ImageNet-21k with\n21k classes and 14M images (Deng et al., 2009), and JFT (Sun et al., 2017) with 18k classes and\n303M high-resolution images. We de-duplicate the pre-training datasets w.r.t. the test sets of the\ndownstream tasks following Kolesnikov et al. (2020). We transfer the models trained on these\ndataset to several benchmark tasks: ImageNet on the original validation labels and the cleaned-up\nReaL labels (Beyer et al., 2020), CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky, 2009), Oxford-IIIT Pets (Parkhi et al.,\n2012), and Oxford Flowers-102 (Nilsback & Zisserman, 2008). For these datasets, pre-processing\nfollows Kolesnikov et al. (2020).\n4\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nModel Layers Hidden size D MLP size Heads Params\nViT-Base 12 768 3072 12 86M\nViT-Large 24 1024 4096 16 307M\nViT-Huge 32 1280 5120 16 632M\nTable 1: Details of Vision Transformer model variants.\nWe also evaluate on the 19-task VTAB classiﬁcation suite (Zhai et al., 2019b). VTAB evaluates\nlow-data transfer to diverse tasks, using 1 000 training examples per task. The tasks are divided into\nthree groups: Natural – tasks like the above, Pets, CIFAR, etc. Specialized – medical and satellite\nimagery, and Structured – tasks that require geometric understanding like localization.\nModel Variants. We base ViT conﬁgurations on those used for BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), as\nsummarized in Table 1. The “Base” and “Large” models are directly adopted from BERT and we\nadd the larger “Huge” model. In what follows we use brief notation to indicate the model size and\nthe input patch size: for instance, ViT-L/16 means the “Large” variant with16×16 input patch size.\nNote that the Transformer’s sequence length is inversely proportional to the square of the patch size,\nthus models with smaller patch size are computationally more expensive.\nFor the baseline CNNs, we use ResNet (He et al., 2016), but replace the Batch Normalization lay-\ners (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) with Group Normalization (Wu & He, 2018), and used standardized\nconvolutions (Qiao et al., 2019). These modiﬁcations improve transfer (Kolesnikov et al., 2020),\nand we denote the modiﬁed model “ResNet (BiT)”. For the hybrids, we feed the intermediate fea-\nture maps into ViT with patch size of one “pixel”. To experiment with different sequence lengths,\nwe either (i) take the output of stage 4 of a regular ResNet50 or (ii) remove stage 4, place the same\nnumber of layers in stage 3 (keeping the total number of layers), and take the output of this extended\nstage 3. Option (ii) results in a 4x longer sequence length, and a more expensive ViT model.\nTraining & Fine-tuning. We train all models, including ResNets, using Adam (Kingma & Ba,\n2015) with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, a batch size of 4096 and apply a high weight decay of 0.1, which\nwe found to be useful for transfer of all models (Appendix D.1 shows that, in contrast to common\npractices, Adam works slightly better than SGD for ResNets in our setting). We use a linear learning\nrate warmup and decay, see Appendix B.1 for details. For ﬁne-tuning we use SGD with momentum,\nbatch size 512, for all models, see Appendix B.1.1. For ImageNet results in Table 2, we ﬁne-tuned at\nhigher resolution: 512 for ViT-L/16 and 518 for ViT-H/14, and also used Polyak & Juditsky (1992)\naveraging with a factor of 0.9999 (Ramachandran et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020b).\nMetrics. We report results on downstream datasets either through few-shot or ﬁne-tuning accuracy.\nFine-tuning accuracies capture the performance of each model after ﬁne-tuning it on the respective\ndataset. Few-shot accuracies are obtained by solving a regularized least-squares regression problem\nthat maps the (frozen) representation of a subset of training images to{−1,1}K target vectors. This\nformulation allows us to recover the exact solution in closed form. Though we mainly focus on\nﬁne-tuning performance, we sometimes use linear few-shot accuracies for fast on-the-ﬂy evaluation\nwhere ﬁne-tuning would be too costly.\n4.2 C OMPARISON TO STATE OF THE ART\nWe ﬁrst compare our largest models – ViT-H/14 and ViT-L/16 – to state-of-the-art CNNs from\nthe literature. The ﬁrst comparison point is Big Transfer (BiT) (Kolesnikov et al., 2020), which\nperforms supervised transfer learning with large ResNets. The second is Noisy Student (Xie et al.,\n2020), which is a large EfﬁcientNet trained using semi-supervised learning on ImageNet and JFT-\n300M with the labels removed. Currently, Noisy Student is the state of the art on ImageNet and\nBiT-L on the other datasets reported here. All models were trained on TPUv3 hardware, and we\nreport the number of TPUv3-core-days taken to pre-train each of them, that is, the number of TPU\nv3 cores (2 per chip) used for training multiplied by the training time in days.\nTable 2 shows the results. The smaller ViT-L/16 model pre-trained on JFT-300M outperforms BiT-L\n(which is pre-trained on the same dataset) on all tasks, while requiring substantially less computa-\ntional resources to train. The larger model, ViT-H/14, further improves the performance, especially\non the more challenging datasets – ImageNet, CIFAR-100, and the VTAB suite. Interestingly, this\n5\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nOurs-JFT Ours-JFT Ours-I21k BiT-L Noisy Student\n(ViT-H/14) (ViT-L/16) (ViT-L/16) (ResNet152x4) (EfﬁcientNet-L2)\nImageNet 88.55±0.04 87.76±0.03 85.30±0.02 87.54±0.02 88.4/88.5∗\nImageNet ReaL 90.72±0.05 90.54±0.03 88.62±0.05 90.54 90 .55\nCIFAR-10 99.50±0.06 99.42±0.03 99.15±0.03 99.37±0.06 −\nCIFAR-100 94.55±0.04 93.90±0.05 93.25±0.05 93.51±0.08 −\nOxford-IIIT Pets 97.56±0.03 97.32±0.11 94.67±0.15 96.62±0.23 −\nOxford Flowers-102 99.68±0.02 99.74±0.00 99.61±0.02 99.63±0.03 −\nVTAB (19 tasks) 77.63±0.23 76.28±0.46 72.72±0.21 76.29±1.70 −\nTPUv3-core-days 2.5k 0.68k 0.23k 9.9k 12.3k\nTable 2: Comparison with state of the art on popular image classiﬁcation benchmarks.

Finally, the ViT-L/16 model\npre-trained on the public ImageNet-21k dataset performs well on most datasets too, while taking\nfewer resources to pre-train: it could be trained using a standard cloud TPUv3 with 8 cores in ap-\nproximately 30 days.\nFigure 2 decomposes the VTAB tasks into their respective groups, and compares to previous SOTA\nmethods on this benchmark: BiT, VIVI – a ResNet co-trained on ImageNet and Youtube (Tschannen\net al., 2020), and S4L – supervised plus semi-supervised learning on ImageNet (Zhai et al., 2019a).\nViT-H/14 outperforms BiT-R152x4, and other methods, on theNatural and Structured tasks.

With fewer\ninductive biases for vision than ResNets, how crucial is the dataset size? We perform two series of\nexperiments.\nFirst, we pre-train ViT models on datasets of increasing size: ImageNet, ImageNet-21k, and JFT-\n300M. To boost the performance on the smaller datasets, we optimize three basic regularization\nparameters – weight decay, dropout, and label smoothing. Figure 3 shows the results after ﬁne-\ntuning to ImageNet (results on other datasets are shown in Table 5) 2. When pre-trained on the\nsmallest dataset, ImageNet, ViT-Large models underperform compared to ViT-Base models, despite\n(moderate) regularization. With ImageNet-21k pre-training, their performances are similar. Only\nwith JFT-300M, do we see the full beneﬁt of larger models. Figure 3 also shows the performance\n2Note that the ImageNet pre-trained models are also ﬁne-tuned, but again on ImageNet. This is because the\nresolution increase during ﬁne-tuning improves the performance.\n6\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nImageNet ImageNet-21k JFT-300M\nPre-training dataset\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90ImageNet Top1 Accuracy [%]\nBiT\nViT-B/32\nViT-B/16\nViT-L/32\nViT-L/16\nViT-H/14\nFigure 3: Transfer to ImageNet.

The BiT CNNs outperform ViT on ImageNet, but\nwith the larger datasets, ViT overtakes.\nSecond, we train our models on random subsets of 9M, 30M, and 90M as well as the full JFT-\n300M dataset. We do not perform additional regularization on the smaller subsets and use the same\nhyper-parameters for all settings. This way, we assess the intrinsic model properties, and not the\neffect of regularization. We do, however, use early-stopping, and report the best validation accuracy\nachieved during training. To save compute, we report few-shot linear accuracy instead of full ﬁne-\ntuning accuracy. Figure 4 contains the results. Vision Transformers overﬁt more than ResNets with\ncomparable computational cost on smaller datasets. For example, ViT-B/32 is slightly faster than\nResNet50; it performs much worse on the 9M subset, but better on 90M+ subsets. The same is true\nfor ResNet152x2 and ViT-L/16. This result reinforces the intuition that the convolutional inductive\nbias is useful for smaller datasets, but for larger ones, learning the relevant patterns directly from\ndata is sufﬁcient, even beneﬁcial.\nOverall, the few-shot results on ImageNet (Figure 4), as well as the low-data results on VTAB\n(Table 2) seem promising for very low-data transfer. Further analysis of few-shot properties of ViT\nis an exciting direction of future work.\n7\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n4.4 S CALING STUDY\nWe perform a controlled scaling study of different models by evaluating transfer performance from\nJFT-300M. In this setting data size does not bottleneck the models’ performances, and we assess\nperformance versus pre-training cost of each model. The model set includes: 7 ResNets, R50x1,\nR50x2 R101x1, R152x1, R152x2, pre-trained for 7 epochs, plus R152x2 and R200x3 pre-trained\nfor 14 epochs; 6 Vision Transformers, ViT-B/32, B/16, L/32, L/16, pre-trained for 7 epochs, plus\nL/16 and H/14 pre-trained for 14 epochs; and 5 hybrids, R50+ViT-B/32, B/16, L/32, L/16 pre-\ntrained for 7 epochs, plus R50+ViT-L/16 pre-trained for 14 epochs (for hybrids, the number at the\nend of the model name stands not for the patch size, but for the total dowsampling ratio in the ResNet\nbackbone).\nFigure 5 contains the transfer performance versus total pre-training compute (see Appendix D.5\nfor details on computational costs). Detailed results per model are provided in Table 6 in the Ap-\npendix. A few patterns can be observed. First, Vision Transformers dominate ResNets on the\nperformance/compute trade-off. ViT uses approximately 2 −4×less compute to attain the same\nperformance (average over 5 datasets). Second, hybrids slightly outperform ViT at small compu-\ntational budgets, but the difference vanishes for larger models. This result is somewhat surprising,\nsince one might expect convolutional local feature processing to assist ViT at any size. Third, Vision\nTransformers appear not to saturate within the range tried, motivating future scaling efforts.\n4.5 I NSPECTING VISION TRANSFORMER\nInput\n Attention\nFigure 6: Representative ex-\namples of attention from the\noutput token to the input\nspace. See Appendix D.7 for\ndetails.\nTo begin to understand how the Vision Transformer processes im-\nage data, we analyze its internal representations. The ﬁrst layer of\nthe Vision Transformer linearly projects the ﬂattened patches into a\nlower-dimensional space (Eq. 1). Figure 7 (left) shows the top prin-\ncipal components of the the learned embedding ﬁlters. The com-\nponents resemble plausible basis functions for a low-dimensional\nrepresentation of the ﬁne structure within each patch.\nAfter the projection, a learned position embedding is added to the\npatch representations. Figure 7 (center) shows that the model learns\nto encode distance within the image in the similarity of position em-\nbeddings, i.e. closer patches tend to have more similar position em-\nbeddings. Further, the row-column structure appears; patches in the\nsame row/column have similar embeddings. Finally, a sinusoidal\nstructure is sometimes apparent for larger grids (Appendix D). That\nthe position embeddings learn to represent 2D image topology ex-\nplains why hand-crafted 2D-aware embedding variants do not yield\nimprovements (Appendix D.4).\nSelf-attention allows ViT to integrate information across the entire\nimage even in the lowest layers. We investigate to what degree\nthe network makes use of this capability. Speciﬁcally, we compute\nthe average distance in image space across which information is\nintegrated, based on the attention weights (Figure 7, right). This\n“attention distance” is analogous to receptive ﬁeld size in CNNs.\nWe ﬁnd that some heads attend to most of the image already in the lowest layers, showing that\nthe ability to integrate information globally is indeed used by the model. Other attention heads\nhave consistently small attention distances in the low layers. This highly localized attention is\nless pronounced in hybrid models that apply a ResNet before the Transformer (Figure 7, right),\nsuggesting that it may serve a similar function as early convolutional layers in CNNs. Further, the\nattention distance increases with network depth. Globally, we ﬁnd that the model attends to image\nregions that are semantically relevant for classiﬁcation (Figure 6).\n4.6 S ELF -SUPERVISION\nTransformers show impressive performance on NLP tasks. However, much of their success stems\nnot only from their excellent scalability but also from large scale self-supervised pre-training (Devlin\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nRGB embedding filters\n(first 28 principal components)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInput patch column\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7 Input patch row\nPosition embedding similarity\n1\n1\nCosine similarity\n0 5 10 15 20\nNetwork depth (layer)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120Mean attention distance (pixels)\nViT-L/16\nHead 1\nHead 2\nHead 3\n...\nFigure 7: Left: Filters of the initial linear embedding of RGB values of ViT-L/32.

See Appendix D.7 for details.\net al., 2019; Radford et al., 2018). We also perform a preliminary exploration on masked patch\nprediction for self-supervision, mimicking the masked language modeling task used in BERT. With\nself-supervised pre-training, our smaller ViT-B/16 model achieves 79.9% accuracy on ImageNet, a\nsigniﬁcant improvement of 2% to training from scratch, but still 4% behind supervised pre-training.\nAppendix B.1.2 contains further details. We leave exploration of contrastive pre-training (Chen\net al., 2020b; He et al., 2020; Bachman et al., 2019; H´enaff et al., 2020) to future work.\n5 C ONCLUSION\nWe have explored the direct application of Transformers to image recognition. Unlike prior works\nusing self-attention in computer vision, we do not introduce image-speciﬁc inductive biases into\nthe architecture apart from the initial patch extraction step. Instead, we interpret an image as a\nsequence of patches and process it by a standard Transformer encoder as used in NLP. This simple,\nyet scalable, strategy works surprisingly well when coupled with pre-training on large datasets.\nThus, Vision Transformer matches or exceeds the state of the art on many image classiﬁcation\ndatasets, whilst being relatively cheap to pre-train.\nWhile these initial results are encouraging, many challenges remain. One is to apply ViT to other\ncomputer vision tasks, such as detection and segmentation. Our results, coupled with those in Carion\net al. (2020), indicate the promise of this approach. Another challenge is to continue exploring self-\nsupervised pre-training methods. Our initial experiments show improvement from self-supervised\npre-training, but there is still large gap between self-supervised and large-scale supervised pre-\ntraining. Finally, further scaling of ViT would likely lead to improved performance.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe work was performed in Berlin, Z ¨urich, and Amsterdam.

For each element in an input sequence z ∈RN×D, we compute a weighted sum over all\nvalues v in the sequence. The attention weights Aij are based on the pairwise similarity between\ntwo elements of the sequence and their respective query qi and key kj representations.\n[q,k,v] =zUqkv Uqkv ∈RD×3Dh, (5)\nA= softmax\n(\nqk⊤/\n√\nDh\n)\nA∈RN×N , (6)\nSA(z) =Av . (7)\nMultihead self-attention (MSA) is an extension of SA in which we run kself-attention operations,\ncalled “heads”, in parallel, and project their concatenated outputs. To keep compute and number of\nparameters constant when changing k, Dh (Eq. 5) is typically set to D/k.\nMSA(z) = [SA1(z); SA2(z); ··· ; SAk(z)] Umsa Umsa ∈Rk·Dh×D (8)\nB E XPERIMENT DETAILS\nB.1 T RAINING\nTable 3 summarizes our training setups for our different models. We found strong regularization\nto be key when training models from scratch on ImageNet. Dropout, when used, is applied after\nevery dense layer except for the the qkv-projections and directly after adding positional- to patch\nembeddings. Hybrid models are trained with the exact setup as their ViT counterparts. Finally, all\ntraining is done on resolution 224.\nB.1.1 F INE -TUNING\nWe ﬁne-tune all ViT models using SGD with a momentum of 0.9. We run a small grid search over\nlearning rates, see learning rate ranges in Table 4. To do so, we use small sub-splits from the training\nset (10% for Pets and Flowers, 2% for CIFAR, 1% ImageNet) as development set and train on the\nremaining data. For ﬁnal results we train on the entire training set and evaluate on the respective\ntest data. For ﬁne-tuning ResNets and hybrid models we use the exact same setup, with the only\nexception of ImageNet where we add another value 0.06 to the learning rate sweep. Additionally,\n13\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nDataset Steps Base LR\nImageNet 20 000 {0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06}\nCIFAR100 10 000 {0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03}\nCIFAR10 10 000 {0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03}\nOxford-IIIT Pets 500 {0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03}\nOxford Flowers-102 500 {0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03}\nVTAB (19 tasks) 2 500 0.01\nTable 4: Hyperparameters for ﬁne-tuning. All models are ﬁne-tuned with cosine learning rate decay,\na batch size of 512, no weight decay, and grad clipping at global norm 1. If not mentioned otherwise,\nﬁne-tuning resolution is 384.\nfor ResNets we also run the setup of Kolesnikov et al. (2020) and select the best results across\nthis run and our sweep. Finally, if not mentioned otherwise, all ﬁne-tuning experiments run at 384\nresolution (running ﬁne-tuning at different resolution than training is common practice (Kolesnikov\net al., 2020)).\nWhen transferring ViT models to another dataset, we remove the whole head (two linear layers) and\nreplace it by a single, zero-initialized linear layer outputting the number of classes required by the\ntarget dataset. We found this to be a little more robust than simply re-initializing the very last layer.\nFor VTAB we follow the protocol in Kolesnikov et al. (2020), and use the same hyperparameter\nsetting for all tasks. We use a learning rate of 0.01 and train for 2500 steps (Tab. 4). We chose this\nsetting by running a small sweep over two learning rates and two schedules, and selecting the setting\nwith the highest VTAB score on the 200-example validation sets. We follow the pre-processing used\nin Kolesnikov et al. (2020), except that we do not use task-speciﬁc input resolutions. Instead we ﬁnd\nthat Vision Transformer beneﬁts most from a high resolution (384 ×384) for all tasks.\nB.1.2 S ELF -SUPERVISION\nWe employ the masked patch predictionobjective for preliminary self-supervision experiments. To\ndo so we corrupt 50% of patch embeddings by either replacing their embeddings with a learnable\n[mask] embedding (80%), a random other patch embedding (10%) or just keeping them as is\n(10%). This setup is very similar to the one used for language by Devlin et al. (2019). Finally, we\npredict the 3-bit, mean color (i.e., 512 colors in total) of every corrupted patch using their respective\npatch representations.\nWe trained our self-supervised model for 1M steps (ca. 14 epochs) with batch size 4096 on JFT. We\nuse Adam, with a base learning rate of2·10−4, warmup of 10k steps and cosine learning rate decay.\nAs prediction targets for pretraining we tried the following settings: 1) predicting only the mean,\n3bit color (i.e., 1 prediction of 512 colors), 2) predicting a 4 ×4 downsized version of the 16 ×16\npatch with 3bit colors in parallel (i.e., 16 predictions of 512 colors), 3) regression on the full patch\nusing L2 (i.e., 256 regressions on the 3 RGB channels). Surprisingly, we found that all worked quite\nwell, though L2 was slightly worse. We report ﬁnal results only for option 1) because it has shown\nbest few-shot performance. We also experimented with 15% corruption rate as used by Devlin et al.\n(2019) but results were also slightly worse on our few-shot metrics.\nLastly, we would like to remark that our instantiation of masked patch prediction doesn’t require\nsuch an enormous amount of pretraining nor a large dataset such as JFT in order to lead to sim-\nilar performance gains on ImageNet classiﬁcation. That is, we observed diminishing returns on\ndownstream performance after 100k pretraining steps, and see similar gains when pretraining on\nImageNet.\nC A DDITIONAL RESULTS\nWe report detailed results corresponding to the ﬁgures presented in the paper.

For\nSGD, we use the hyperparameters recommended by Kolesnikov et al. (2020). Results are presented\nin Table 7. Adam pre-training outperforms SGD pre-training on most datasets and on average.\nThis justiﬁes the choice of Adam as the optimizer used to pre-train ResNets on JFT. Note that the\nabsolute numbers are lower than those reported by Kolesnikov et al. (2020), since we pre-train only\nfor 7 epochs, not 30.\nD.2 T RANSFORMER SHAPE\nWe ran ablations on scaling different dimensions of the Transformer architecture to ﬁnd out which\nare best suited for scaling to very large models. Figure 8 shows 5-shot performance on ImageNet\nfor different conﬁgurations. All conﬁgurations are based on a ViT model with 8 layers, D = 1024,\nDMLP = 2048 and a patch size of 32, the intersection of all lines. We can see that scaling the\ndepth results in the biggest improvements which are clearly visible up until 64 layers. However,\ndiminishing returns are already visible after 16 layers. Interestingly, scaling the width of the net-\nwork seems to result in the smallest changes. Decreasing the patch size and thus increasing the\neffective sequence length shows surprisingly robust improvements without introducing parameters.\nThese ﬁndings suggest that compute might be a better predictor of performance than the number of\nparameters, and that scaling should emphasize depth over width if any. Overall, we ﬁnd that scaling\nall dimensions proportionally results in robust improvements.\nD.3 H EAD TYPE AND C L A S STOKEN\nIn order to stay as close as possible to the original Transformer model, we made use of an additional\n[class] token, which is taken as image representation. The output of this token is then trans-\nformed into a class prediction via a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with tanh as non-linearity\nin the single hidden layer.\nThis design is inherited from the Transformer model for text, and we use it throughout the main\npaper. An initial attempt at using only image-patch embeddings, globally average-pooling (GAP)\nthem, followed by a linear classiﬁer—just like ResNet’s ﬁnal feature map—performed very poorly.\nHowever, we found that this is neither due to the extra token, nor to the GAP operation. Instead,\n16\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nEpochs of training\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60ImageNet linear 5-shot accuracy [%]\nCLS-Token, lr=8e-4\nGAP, lr=8e-4\nGAP, lr=3e-4\nFigure 9: Comparison of class-token and global average pooling classiﬁers.

We\ntried the following cases:\n• Providing no positional information: Considering the inputs as a bag of patches.\n• 1-dimensional positional embedding: Considering the inputs as a sequence of patches in\nthe raster order (default across all other experiments in this paper).\n• 2-dimensional positional embedding: Considering the inputs as a grid of patches in two\ndimensions. In this case, two sets of embeddings are learned, each for one of the axes,\nX-embedding, and Y-embedding, each with size D/2. Then, based on the coordinate on\nthe path in the input, we concatenate the X and Y embedding to get the ﬁnal positional\nembedding for that patch.\n• Relative positional embeddings: Considering the relative distance between patches to en-\ncode the spatial information as instead of their absolute position. To do so, we use 1-\ndimensional Relative Attention, in which we deﬁne the relative distance all possible pairs\nof patches. Thus, for every given pair (one as query, and the other as key/value in the at-\ntention mechanism), we have an offset pq −pk, where each offset is associated with an\nembedding. Then, we simply run extra attention, where we use the original query (the\ncontent of query), but use relative positional embeddings as keys. We then use the log-\nits from the relative attention as a bias term and add it to the logits of the main attention\n(content-based attention) before applying the softmax.\nIn addition to different ways of encoding spatial information, we also tried different ways of in-\ncorporating this information in our model. For the 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional positional\nembeddings, we tried three different cases: (1) add positional embeddings to the inputs right after\n17\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\nInput patch column\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14 Input patch row\nViT-L16\n7 epochs, LR=0.0002, WD=0.01\n1\n1\nCosine similarity\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\nInput patch column\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14 Input patch row\nViT-L16\n7 epochs, LR=0.0004, WD=0.1\n1\n1\nCosine similarity\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\nInput patch column\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14 Input patch row\nViT-L16\n14 epochs, LR=0.0004, WD=0.1\n1\n1\nCosine similarity\nFigure 10: Position embeddings of models trained with different hyperparameters.\nthe stem of them model and before feeding the inputs to the Transformer encoder (default across\nall other experiments in this paper); (2) learn and add positional embeddings to the inputs at the\nbeginning of each layer; (3) add a learned positional embeddings to the inputs at the beginning of\neach layer (shared between layers).\nTable 8 summarizes the results from this ablation study on a ViT-B/16 model. As we can see, while\nthere is a large gap between the performances of the model with no positional embedding and mod-\nels with positional embedding, there is little to no difference between different ways of encoding\npositional information. We speculate that since our Transformer encoder operates on patch-level\ninputs, as opposed to pixel-level, the differences in how to encode spatial information is less impor-\ntant. More precisely, in patch-level inputs, the spatial dimensions are much smaller than the original\npixel-level inputs, e.g., 14 ×14 as opposed to 224 ×224, and learning to represent the spatial re-\nlations in this resolution is equally easy for these different positional encoding strategies. Even so,\nthe speciﬁc pattern of position embedding similarity learned by the network depends on the training\nhyperparameters (Figure 10).\n0 5 10 15 20\nNetwork depth (layer)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120Mean attention distance (pixels)\nViT-L/16\nHead 1\nHead 2\nHead 3\n...\n0 5 10 15 20\nNetwork depth (layer)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nR50x1 + ViT-L/16\nHead 1\nHead 2\nHead 3\n...\nFigure 11: Size of attended area by head and network depth.

For this purpose,\n18\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nwe perform timing of inference speed for the main models of interest, on a TPUv3 accelerator; the\ndifference between inference and backprop speed is a constant model-independent factor.\nFigure 12 (left) shows how many images one core can handle per second, across various input sizes.\nEvery single point refers to the peak performance measured across a wide range of batch-sizes. As\ncan be seen, the theoretical bi-quadratic scaling of ViT with image size only barely starts happening\nfor the largest models at the largest resolutions.\nAnother quantity of interest is the largest batch-size each model can ﬁt onto a core, larger being\nbetter for scaling to large datasets. Figure 12 (right) shows this quantity for the same set of models.\nThis shows that large ViT models have a clear advantage in terms of memory-efﬁciency over ResNet\nmodels.\n64 128 224 384 512\nInput size [px]\n102\n103\n104\nPeak inference speed [img/sec/core] 64 128 224 384 512\nInput size [px]\n102\n103\nLargest per-core batch-size\nR50x1\nR50x2\nViT-B/32\nViT-L/32\nViT-B/16\nViT-L/16\nViT-H/14\nR152x4\nFigure 12: Left: Real wall-clock timings of various architectures across input sizes.

The general idea of axial\nattention is to perform multiple attention operations, each along a single axis of the input tensor,\ninstead of applying 1-dimensional attention to the ﬂattened version of the input. In axial attention,\neach attention mixes information along a particular axis, while keeping information along the other\naxes independent. Along this line, Wang et al. (2020b) proposed the AxialResNet model in which\nall the convolutions with kernel size 3 ×3 in a ResNet50 are replaced by axial self-attention, i.e.\na row and column attention, augmented by relative positional encoding. We have implemented\nAxialResNet as a baseline model.3.\nMoreover, we have modiﬁed ViT to process inputs in the 2-dimensional shape, instead of a 1-\ndimensional sequence of patches, and incorporate Axial Transformer blocks, in which instead of\na self-attention followed by an MLP, we have a a row-self-attention plus an MLP followed by a\ncolumn-self-attention plus an MLP.\nFigure 13, present the performance of Axial ResNet, Axial-ViT-B/32 and Axial-ViT-B/16 on Ima-\ngeNet 5shot linear, when pretrained on JFT dataset, verses the pretraining compute, both in terms of\nnumber of FLOPs and inference time (example per seconds). As we can see, both Axial-ViT-B/32\nand Axial-ViT-B/16 do better than their ViT-B counterpart in terms of performance, but it comes at\n3Our implementation is based on the open-sourced PyTorch implementation inhttps://github.com/\ncsrhddlam/axial-deeplab. In our experiments, we reproduced the scores reported in (Wang et al.,\n2020b) in terms of accuracy, however, our implementation, similar to the open-source implementation, is very\nslow on TPUs. Therefore, we were not able to use it for extensive large-scale experiments. These may be\nunlocked by a carefully optimized implementation.\n19\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n102\nTotal compute [exaFLOPs]\n0.500\n0.525\n0.550\n0.575\n0.600\n0.625\n0.650ImageNet 5-shot linear top-1 accuracy\nAxialViT-B/16\nAxialViT-B/32\nViT-B/16\nViT-B/32\nResNet50\nAxialResNet50\n102103\nPeak inference speed [img/sec/core]\n0.500\n0.525\n0.550\n0.575\n0.600\n0.625\n0.650ImageNet 5-shot linear top-1 accuracy\nAxialViT-B/16\nAxialViT-B/32\nViT-B/16\nViT-B/32\nResNet50\nAxialResNet50\nFigure 13: Performance of Axial-Attention based models, in terms of top-1 accuracy on ImageNet\n5-shot linear, versus their speed in terms of number of FLOPs (left) and inference time (left).\nthe cost of more compute. This is because in Axial-ViT models, each Transformer block with global\nself-attention is replaced by two Axial Transformer blocks, one with row and one with column self-\nattention and although the sequence length that self-attention operates on is smaller in axial case,\nthere is a extra MLP per Axial-ViT block. For the AxialResNet, although it looks reasonable in\nterms of accuracy/compute trade-off (Figure 13, left), the naive implementation is extremely slow\non TPUs (Figure 13, right).\nD.7 A TTENTION DISTANCE\nTo understand how ViT uses self-attention to integrate information across the image, we analyzed\nthe average distance spanned by attention weights at different layers (Figure 11). This “attention\ndistance” is analogous to receptive ﬁeld size in CNNs. Average attention distance is highly variable\nacross heads in lower layers, with some heads attending to much of the image, while others attend\nto small regions at or near the query location. As depth increases, attention distance increases for all\nheads. In the second half of the network, most heads attend widely across tokens.\nD.8 A TTENTION MAPS\nTo compute maps of the attention from the output token to the input space (Figures 6 and 14), we\nused Attention Rollout (Abnar & Zuidema, 2020). Brieﬂy, we averaged attention weights of ViT-\nL/16 across all heads and then recursively multiplied the weight matrices of all layers. This accounts\nfor the mixing of attention across tokens through all layers.\nD.9 O BJECT NET RESULTS\nWe also evaluate our ﬂagship ViT-H/14 model on the ObjectNet benchmark following the evaluation\nsetup in Kolesnikov et al. (2020), resulting in 82.1% top-5 accuracy and 61.7% top-1 accuracy.\nD.10 VTAB B REAKDOWN\nTable 9 shows the scores attained on each of the VTAB-1k tasks.\n20\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n9\n 10\n 11\n 12\n 13\n 14\n 15\n 16\n17\n 18\n 19\n 20\n 21\n 22\n 23\n 24\n25\n 26\n 27\n 28\n 29\n 30\n 31\n 32\n33\n 34\n 35\n 36\n 37\n 38\n 39\n 40\n41\n 42\n 43\n 44\n 45\n 46\n 47\n 48\n49\n 50\n 51\n 52\n 53\n 54\n 55\n 56\n57\n 58\n 59\n 60\n 61\n 62\n 63\n 64\n65\n 66\n 67\n 68\n 69\n 70\n 71\n 72\n73\n 74\n 75\n 76\n 77\n 78\n 79\n 80\n81\n 82\n 83\n 84\n 85\n 86\n 87\n 88\n89\n 90\n 91\n 92\n 93\n 94\n 95\n 96\n97\n 98\n 99\n 100\n 101\n 102\n 103\n 104\n105\n 106\n 107\n 108\n 109\n 110\n 111\n 112\n113\n 114\n 115\n 116\n 117\n 118\n 119\n 120\n121\n 122\n 123\n 124\n 125\n 126\n 127\n 128\nFigure 14: Further example attention maps as in Figure 6 (random selection).\n21\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\nTable 9: Breakdown of VTAB-1k performance across tasks.\nCaltech101\nCIFAR-100\nDTD\nFlowers102\nPets\nSun397\nSVHN\nCamelyon\nEuroSAT\nResisc45\nRetinopathy\nClevr-Count\nClevr-Dist\nDMLab\ndSpr-Loc\ndSpr-Ori\nKITTI-Dist\nsNORB-Azim\nsNORB-Elev\nMean\nViT-H/14 (JFT) 95.3 85.5 75.2 99.7 97.2 65.0 88.9 83.3 96.7 91.4 76.6 91.7 63.8 53.1 79.4 63.3 84.5 33.2 51.2 77.6\nViT-L/16 (JFT) 95.4 81.9 74.3 99.7 96.7 63.5 87.4 83.6 96.5 89.7 77.1 86.4 63.1 49.7 74.5 60.5 82.2 36.2 51.1 76.3\nViT-L/16 (I21k) 90.8 84.1 74.1 99.3 92.7 61.0 80.9 82.5 95.6 85.2 75.3 70.3 56.1 41.9 74.7 64.9 79.9 30.5 41.7 72.7\n22"
