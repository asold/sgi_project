INTRODUCTION\nImpedance transformers, namely, matching networks are important\nand fundamental circuit cells in several microwave components\n(devices) and systems [1–6]. For example, impedance transformers\nare main parts of various power dividers and combiners. In addition,\nimpedance transformers can be frequently applied in advanced antenna\narrays and power ampliﬁers. The conventional implementation\nmethods of impedance transformers include using lumped components\n(such as inductors and capacitors), distributed components (such as\nmicrostrip and stripline), and their combinations. Therefore, ﬁnding\nappropriate impedance transformers is one of the important works in\nthe antennas and power ampliﬁers design.\nThe well-known impedance transformer is the quarter-wavelength\ntransmission line. However, it is obvious that this kind of\nimpedance transformer cannot satisfy the requirement of arbitrary\ndual-band operations. By applying the conventional transmission-\nline implementation methods, various kinds of dual-band impedance\ntransformers have been investigated in [7–12]. To match with\ntwo diﬀerent real-value resistances, a set of small dual-frequency\ntransformer with analytical design equations have been developed\nin [7]. The complex terminated impedance case of dual-band\nimpedance transformers has been ﬁrst discussed in [8]; however, the\ndesign equations are not analytical, requiring a complicated analysis\nprocess. Similar mathematical-solving synthesis diﬃculties in the\ndesign of dual-band impedance transformers discussed in [9, 10] still\nexist. Although the closed-form design equations for generalized\nimpedance transformers are given in [11] and the rigorous dual-\nfrequency matching for frequency-dependent complex load impedance\nis satisﬁed, the mathematical expressions are also complex. Obviously,\nthe design process of [11] is quite diﬃcult to repeat due to complex\nequations. In addition, applying open-/short-circuited transmission-\nline stubs into dual-band impedance transformers [12] directly results\nin narrow operating bandwidth and a large-sized circuit layout.\nThe implementation method for impedance transformer by using\ncoupled transmission lines has also attracted the attention of many\nresearchers [13–15]. In [13], a broad-band quarter-wavelength\nimpedance transformer has been proposed. The required even-\nand odd-mode impedance of coupled lines cannot be easily realized\nin microstrip technology. In [14], a novel coupled-line impedance\ntransformer has been developed. This impedance transformer can\nmatch real and complex loads in both narrow and wide frequency\nbands. However, the dual-band application is not considered. By\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 134, 2013 49\nusing an asymmetric broadside coupled line, a small-size impedance\ntransformer is provided in [15]. Note that only single-band application\nhas been studied.\nBecause dual-band RF systems and components in [16–19]\nbecome very signiﬁcant in satisfying both the multi-standard software\ndeﬁned radios and the fast evolution of wireless communication\nstandards, developing new and simple design approaches to dual-\nband transformers for frequency-dependent complex load impedance\nbecomes imperative. In order to achieve this goal, a novel dual-\nfrequency coupled-line impedance transformer with a closed-form\ndesign approach and practical examples for frequency-dependent\ncomplex load impedance is proposed in this paper. This transformer\nconﬁguration consists of a coupled-line section and a transmission line.\nIt has compact size and reliable analytical design approach. The\nproposed transformer can be easily applied in the printed circuit board\n(PCB)-based dual-band passive circuit and power ampliﬁers. It is\nworth mentioning that one of its attractive attributes is the provided\ndesign method, which is based on simple closed-form mathematical\nexpressions. Additionally, two generalizedT-junction power dividers\nwith diﬀerent power-dividing coeﬃcients at two arbitrary operating\nfrequencies are constructed, designed, fabricated, and measured. The\nmeasured results agree well with the calculated ones.\n2. THE PROPOSED CIRCUIT AND DESIGN\nAPPROACH\nFigure 1 shows the circuit conﬁguration of the proposed impedance\ntransformer. This transformer includes two parts: 1) a section coupled\nSR\n1 , Z\n() () ()\n1\nnLf Lf LfZR jX\n  = 1,2.\n22Z\ninZ\nθe 0 1,\n, θ\nn = n +\nn\nZ\nFigure 1. The proposed dual-band coupled-line impedance\ntransformer for arbitrary complex frequency-dependent terminated\nimpedances.\n50 Wu et al.\nline; 2) a single-section traditional transmission line. The even-mode\n(odd-mode) characteristic impedance for the coupled-line section is\nZe1(Zo1) and its electrical length isθ1. The characteristic impedance\nof the traditional transmission line isZ2 and its electrical length isθ2.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the source resistance isRS which is usually equal\nto 50 Ω. However, the required matched load impedance is complex\nand frequency dependent. For arbitrary dual-frequency application,\nnamely f1 and f2(f2 ≥ f1), these terminated load impedances are\nZL(f1) = RL(f1) + jXL(f1) at f1 and ZL(f2) = RL(f2) + jXL(f2)\nat f2, respectively. The values of four parameters such as RL(f1),\nRL(f2), XL(f1), and XL(f2) are arbitrary, indicating most cases of the\nterminated impedances. The ABCD matrix of the coupled-line section\ncan be derived from scattering parameters in [20] as\n\n\n\nA1 = D1 = Ze1 − Zo1 tan2(θ1)\nZe1 + Zo1 tan2(θ1),\nB1 = 2Ze1Zo1j tan(θ1)\nZe1 + Zo1 tan2(θ1),\nC1 = 2j tan(θ1)\nZe1 + Zo1 tan2(θ1).\n(1)\nFurthermore, the input impedanceZin presented in Figure 1 can be\ndeﬁned as\nZin = Rin + jXin. (2)\nAccording to transmission-line theory and dual-frequency matching\nresults [9, 11], the values of the characteristic impedance Z2 and\nelectrical length θ2 at the ﬁrst operating frequency f1 of the\ntransmission-line section shown in Figure 1 can be expressed by\nZ2 =\n√ RL(f1)RL(f2) + XL(f1)XL(f2)\n+\n[XL(f1)+XL(f2)][RL(f1)XL(f2)−XL(f1)RL(f2)]\nRL(f2)−RL(f1)\n, (3)\nθ2(f1) =\nnπ + arctan\n[ Z2(RL(f1)−RL(f2))\nRL(f1)XL(f2)−XL(f1)RL(f2)\n]\n1 +p , (4)\nwhere p = f2/f1 and is frequency-ratio coeﬃcient, andn is an arbitrary\npositive integral or equal to zero. If the design parameters for the\ntransmission line are known, the internal deﬁned parameter, input\nimpedance Zin at the ﬁrst frequencyf1, can be calculated by\n(Rin(f1)+jXin(f1))= Z2[RL(f1)+jXL(f1)+jZ2 tan(θ2(f1))]\nZ2−XL(f1) tan(θ2(f1))+jRL(f1) tan(θ2(f1)). (5)\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 134, 2013 51\nIt is necessary to point out that the input impedanceZin at the second\nfrequency f2 has the following equation associated with (5):\nRin(f2) + jXin(f2) = conj(Rin(f1) + jXin(f1)), (6)\nwhere conj(•) is a complex conjugate function.\nThen, the coupled-line section can be used to match the input\nimpedance Zin to the source resistanceRS at both f1 and f2. The\nfollowing relationship can be obtained as\nRS = A1(f1)(Rin(f1) + jXin(f1)) +B1(f1)\nC1(f1)(Rin(f1) + jXin(f1)) +D1(f1)\n. (7a)\nRS = A1(f2)(Rin(f2) + jXin(f2)) +B1(f2)\nC1(f2)(Rin(f2) + jXin(f2)) +D1(f2)\n. (7b)\nAfter combining (1) and (7), the following equations can be derived\nas{2Xin(f1)RS tan(θ1(f1)) = (RS − Rin(f1))\n[\nZe1 − Zo1 tan2 (\nθ1(f1)\n)]\n2(Rin(f1)RS−Ze1Zo1) tan(θ1(f1))= Xin(f1)\n[\nZe1−Zo1 tan2 (\nθ1(f1)\n)] . (8)\nBy solving Equation (8) at two diﬀerent operating frequenciesf1 and\nf2, we can obtain a group of simple and analytical design equations for\nthe even- and odd-mode characteristic impedances, which is\nZo1 =\n−\n2(Xin(f1))RS tan(θ1(f1))\n(RS−Rin(f1))\n±\n√\n[2(Xin(f1))RS tan(θ1(f1))\n(RS−Rin(f1))\n]2\n−4 tan2(θ1(f1))\n[(Xin(f1))2RS\n(RS−Rin(f1)) − Rin(f1)RS\n]\n2 tan2(θ1(f1)) , (9)\nZe1 = 2Xin(f1)RS tan(θ1(f1))\n(RS − Rin(f1)) + Zo1 tan2(θ1(f1)), (10)\nwhere the electrical lengthθ1(f1) is determined by\nθ1(f1) = π\n1 +p. (11)\nNote that the value ofn in (4) and the sign of “±” in (9) should be\nchosen manually according to the practical requirements.\nThe main design procedure of this impedance transformer can be\nsummarized as follows.\n1) According to the given two frequenciesf1 and f2 practical\napplications, the values of frequency-dependent load impedances\nZL(f1) = RL(f1) + jXL(f1) and ZL(f2) = RL(f2) + jXL(f2) are known.\n52 Wu et al.\n2) The electrical lengthθ1(f1) of the uncoupled transmission line\ncan be determined by (11) while the electrical lengthθ2(f1) of the\ncoupled-line section can be calculated by (4). Note that there are\nsimple relationships between electrical lengths operating atf1 and f2,\nwhich areθ1(f2) = pθ1(f1) and θ2(f2) = pθ2(f1).\n3) The characteristic impedanceZ2 can be obtained by (3) while\nthe internal parameter, namely, input impedanceRin(f1) + jXin(f1), is\ndetermined by (5).\n4) Once the source resistanceRS is known (for example,RS =\n50 Ω), the odd- and even-mode characteristic impedancesZo1 and Ze1\ncan be calculated using (9) and (10).\n3. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES\nIn order to illustrate the ﬂexibility of the dual-frequency matching\ncapability for this proposed impedance transformer, three groups of\nnumerical examples are presented when the source resistance satisﬁes\nRS = 50 Ω. The real and imaginary parts of the frequency-dependent\nload impedance are plotted in Figure 2. The ﬁrst group of examples\ninclude four diﬀerent cases which are cases A1–A4. The initial required\ndesign parameters are listed in Table 1. According to the provided\nanalytical design formula in Section 2, the calculated circuit parameters\nare obtained as given in Table 2. Figure 3 shows the theoretical\nresponses of these four cases. In cases A1–A4, the ﬁrst frequencyf1 is\nﬁxed as 1 GHz but the second frequencyf2 varies from 1.8 to 2.2 GHz.\nThe perfect ﬂexible dual-band matching can be observed in Figure 3.\nDiﬀerent from the cases A1–A4, another group of numerical examples\nincluding cases B1–B4 is designed for varying the ﬁrst frequencyf1.\nThe initial and designed circuit parameters are listed in Tables 3 and\n4, respectively. The input-port scattering parameters of cases B1–\nB4 are shown in Figure 4.

In\nthe following two power divider examples the sign “+” is chosen for the\nEquation (9). Moreover, the situationsn = 0 andn = 1 are considered\nin the analytical design procedures of the impedance transformers used\nfor the ports 2 and 3, respectively. The calculated circuit parameters\nfor Examples A and B are listed in Table 7.\n58 Wu et al.\nA practical substrate with a relative dielectric constant of 3.48 and\na height of 0.762 mm is applied to implement the designed Examples\nA and B. A representative layout of the prototypeT-junction power\ndivider is illustrated in Figure 7.

Without any full-wave simulation optimizations,\nthe layouts of the power dividers are fabricated directly using PCB\ntechnology.

The calculated scattering parameters are\nbased on lossless coupled-line and transmission-line models, are not\nachieved from full-wave electromagnetic simulation tools. Figure 9\nshows the frequency responses of the examples A and B. From\nscattering parameters of example A shown in Figure 9(a), it can be\nachieved that the measured|S21| and |S31| results are −2.72 dB and\n−3.73 dB at 400 MHz (−2.29 dB and−5.23 dB at 1 GHz), and these\nare very close to the calculated results of the ideal schematic circuit\nmodels, which are−2.54 dB and−3.54 dB at 400 MHz (−1.76 dB and\n−4.76 dB at 1 GHz). Similarly, the measured|S21| and |S31| results for\nthe example B, as shown in Figure 9(b), are−3.22 dB and−3.19 dB\nat 400 MHz (−2.62 dB and−4.66 dB at 1.02 GHz), and these are very\nclose to the calculated results of the ideal schematic circuit models,\nwhich are−3.01 dB and−3.01 dB at 400 MHz (−2.12 dB and−4.12 dB\nat 1.02 GHz). The minimum reﬂection coeﬃcients within the ﬁrst band\naround f1 and the second band aroundf2 for example A (example B)\nare −25 dB (−26 dB) and−13.1 dB (−13.2 dB), respectively. Note that\nthe input matching parameters at the second frequency in examples\nA and B may be due to the unequal even- and odd-mode velocities\nin microstrip coupled lines and the inaccurate manufacturing quality\nof the PCB technology. The transmission losses, which occur in the\nmeasured |S21| and |S31| results, could be because the conductor loss,\ndielectric loss, radiation loss, discontinuous, and measurement errors.\n60 Wu et al.\n5. CONCLUSION\nA novel planar coupled-line dual-band impedance transformer which is\nsuitable for frequency-dependent load impedances has been proposed\nin this paper. This transformer has the advantages of small size in\nsimple circuit conﬁguration, wide bandwidth, simple analytical design\nmethod, and easy planar implementation. The mathematical design\nformula is developed in simple analytical form, which provides a\nstraightforward synthesis approach. A total of 12 cases have been\nused to theoretically verify the proposed circuit structure and its\ncorresponding design method. Finally, for experimental veriﬁcation\nand convenient measurement, two prototype microstrip T-junction\npower dividers with diﬀerent power-dividing ratios at two diﬀerent\noperating frequencies are designed, constructed, fabricated, and\nmeasured. Good agreement between the measured results and the\ncalculated results veriﬁes this novel transformer structure and the\nsimple closed-form design equations. It can be believed that this dual-\nband coupled-line impedance transformer is useful for designing dual-\nband passive components and active components including dual-band\nDoherty power ampliﬁers.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was fully supported by a grant from City University of Hong\nKong (Project No. 7002709) and supported in part by the National\nNatural Science Foundation of China (No. 61201027), the Fundamental\nResearch Funds for Central Universities (No. 2012RC0301), and Open\nProject of the State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves (Grant\nNo. K201316).\nREFERENCES\n1.
