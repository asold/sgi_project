    "abstract": "In order to improve the intelligent effect of English teaching in the era of intelligent education, this article conducts an intelligent integration system of AI English teaching resources and information on the basis of multi-agent collaboration. Moreover, this article analyzes the principles and properties of the three algorithms, ALO, GWO, and MFO, and integrates them into the D2D power allocation problem in the two communication modes. In addition, this article studies the effects of population size, variable dimension, and convergence on the overall energy efficiency and generation of D2D users through simulation and combines improved algorithms to construct an intelligent integration system of AI English teaching resources and information under multi-agent collaboration. The simulation experiment study shows that the intelligent integration system of AI English teaching resources and information under the multi-agent writing proposed in this article can play an important role in the integration of English teaching resources and information.",
