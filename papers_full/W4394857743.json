Through an iterative process of \nreflection and refinement, constructive alignment enhances the educational model, \nfocusing on student-centered approaches and strategically equipping learners for suc -\ncess in a dynamically competitive global environment (Biggs, 1996; Loughlin et  al., \n2021; Roßnagel et al., 2021).\nWhile constructive alignment offers potential benefits, some educators find it chal -\nlenging to integrate into their courses. Wikhamn (2017) underscores a few challenges \nto incorporating this approach in higher education, such as the time-consuming nature \nof the approach, especially when it necessitates a comprehensive redesign of courses \nor entire curricula. The intricacy involved in coordinating learning outcomes with \ninstructional strategies and assessment methods, as well as gaps in training and lack of \nknowledge in implementing the approach, add to the challenges. These challenges are \nfurther pronounced in engineering education as engineering programs often delve deep \ninto technical and design content. Aligning detailed technical and design content with \nbroader learning outcomes can be difficult, as it requires translating these complex con -\ncepts into comprehensible, learner-centric objectives (Dym et  al., 2005). Therefore, it \nbecomes imperative to identify and assess tools that can support instructors in develop -\ning high-quality constructive alignment to their courses.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed \nto understand, generate, and interact with human language at a large scale. These models \nare trained on vast datasets of text, enabling them to learn a wide range of language pat -\nterns, structures, and nuances. LLMs use deep learning techniques, particularly neural \nnetworks, to process and produce language in a way that can mimic human-like under -\nstanding and responses (Hadi et al., 2023). Some examples of LLMs include ChatGPT \n(Open AI), Bert (Google), Electra (Google), RoBERTa (Meta), and ERNIE (Baidu). As \nLLMs continue to permeate various aspects of the education realm, integrating their use \ninto course design holds immense promise (Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). The strengths \nof LLMs can be integrated into teaching to unlock opportunities that could aid in per -\nsonalizing learning experiences and tailoring educational content to individual course \nneeds. These systems can be versatile assistants, providing instant access to a vast array \nof educational resources and aiding in crafting engaging lectures and course materials. \nBy integrating LLMs into course design, educators can optimize their time, innovate \ninstructional strategies, and ultimately contribute to a more interactive and impactful \nlearning environment for students.\nThis article presents an innovative framework for integrating LLMs, emphasizing \nChatGPT for its proficiency in fostering conversational engagement—a process where \ninteractive dialogue systems, such as ChatGPT, engage users in meaningful conversa -\ntions, enhancing learning through dynamic interaction—and widespread use to support \nthe implementation of constructive alignment in higher education courses. Through an \nillustrative case study from a graduate-level project management course, we highlight \nthe benefits and challenges of adopting LLMs to transform instructional strategies and \nbolster consistency in course development. Our research emphasizes how technology \ncan be pivotal in elevating the educational journey, aiding instructors in refining course \ndesign, and enriching the student learning experience.\nPage 3 of 21\nPereira et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \n \nLiterature review\nBiggs’ (1996) seminal work on constructive alignment introduces a strategy for designing \nand delivering high-quality learning in higher education. Constructive alignment com -\nbines constructivist learning theory and instructional design literature (Biggs, 1996). On \nthe one hand, constructivism focuses on the notion that the learners’ activities provide \nopportunities to create meaning (Ertmer & Newby, 1993). On the other hand, instruc -\ntional design emphasizes that a course’s objectives and the targets for assessing student \nperformance must be aligned. Biggs (1996) argues that integrating constructivism and \ninstruction design can happen in three aspects. First, the intended learning outcomes \nare clearly stated, intertwined with specific course content, and indicate appropriate per-\nformances. Second, the instructional strategies immerse students in scenarios that are \nlikely to provoke these anticipated performances. Third, the assessment methods used \nto evaluate students are based on the targeted performances. The core principles of con -\nstructive alignment remain relatively constant; however, refinements, variations, and \ndevelopments have built upon Biggs’ original work. Boud (2007) extend Biggs’ model not \nonly to encompass consistency of purpose between the proximate elements of programs \nbut also look well beyond the point of graduation to seek alignment with longer-term \npurposes. Trigwell and Prosser (2014) argue that introducing qualitative differences into \nany of the three constructive alignment aspects—specifically, intended learning out -\ncomes, instructional strategies, and assessment methods—has been observed to cor -\nrelate with variations in the quality of student learning. For example, when educators \ndescribe that their instructional strategies aim to encourage students to deepen or mod -\nify their existing conceptions and to challenge their comprehension, rather than devot -\ning substantial time to presenting information, it tends to result in students being more \ninclined to adopt deeper approaches to learning. According to Magnusson and Rytzler \n(2019), constructive alignment’s focus on goal orientation and standardization aligns \nwell with the market-driven ideals prevalent in higher education today.\nSeveral researchers have utilized the constructive alignment approach to improve stu -\ndents’ learning or identify course design flaws. Croy (2018) used constructive alignment \nto update the presentation rubric to include individual and group performance to align \nwith the course goals, enhancing students’ satisfaction with the course. McCann (2017) \nimplemented constructive alignment in an economics course, where the instructor \nfound that combining formal and informal feedback was essential to promote students’ \nreflection on theory application and deepen their learning. Lasrado and Kaul (2021) \nused constructive alignment in a business and quality management course to introduce \ninnovative ways of designing authentic tasks and aligning them with subject learning \noutcomes. Chan and Lee (2021) utilized constructive alignment to assess holistic attrib -\nutes in Hong Kong’s engineering education, revealing a reliance on indirect assessment \nmethods. Their study emphasized the difficulty of transitioning to direct assessments \nwithout well-designed, standardized marking rubrics. Caution is warranted when apply -\ning Chan and Lee’s (2021) findings to institutions with different characteristics; instruc -\ntors must consider the unique features of each educational context. From prior research, \nit can be inferred that implementing a more robust constructive alignment approach \nis associated with enhanced student learning experiences, demonstrating adaptability \nacross various course contexts.\nPage 4 of 21Pereira et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \nNonetheless, gaps in practical applications of constructive alignment still exist. A \nnoticeable gap persists in applying constructive alignment principles to course design \n(Abejuela et al., 2022; Hailikari et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022; Maia & dos Santos, 2022; \nTobiason, 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). According to the authors cited above, the limitations \nof applying constructive alignment theory include the time to restructure, organize, and \nprepare the course and lectures, and to ensure the curriculum meets institutional quan -\ntitative reporting and grading requirements. Cain and Babar (2016) and Teater (2011) \nmention that educators may face resistance from students in changing from a traditional \nstructure to a more formative way of feedback. Ruge et  al. (2019) analyzed the chal -\nlenges instructors may face in implementing a constructive alignment approach in their \ncourses in Australian universities; they identified factors such as lack of institutional \nsupport, limited resources, resistance by individual academics to changing pedagogical \napproaches, and lack of faculty engagement as possible barriers.\nRegarding instructional design in interdisciplinary graduate education, Borrego and \nCutler (2010) found that constructive alignment between intended learning outcomes, \nassessment methods, and learning experiences is severely lacking. Many higher educa -\ntion (especially in engineering) courses prioritize technical knowledge and skills, often \noverlooking the alignment of learning outcomes, instructional strategies, and assess -\nment methods for a deeper theoretical understanding and practical application. This \ndeficiency can impede students’ ability to connect theoretical concepts with real-world \nengineering challenges, affecting their readiness for the dynamic demands of the pro -\nfession. Addressing this gap may be time-consuming and challenging for educators. \nHowever, leveraging innovative technologies such as ChatGPT can aid instructors in \nimplementing constructive alignment effectively.\nThe literature on the application of LLMs in education reveals a broad spectrum of \nuses. Initial reviews have highlighted the nascent exploration of chatbots in educational \nsettings, underscoring the importance of developing effective learning designs and strat -\negies (Hwang & Chang, 2021; Kasneci et  al., 2023). From an instructor’s perspective, \nrecent studies have concentrated on leveraging technology to automate student assess -\nments, provide adaptive feedback, and generate teaching materials, all of which dem -\nonstrate a shift toward more interactive and responsive educational tools (Sailer et al., \n2023; Bernius et al., 2022; Moore et al., 2022; Sarsa et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2020).\nThe adaptability of LLMs in creating diverse educational content, such as question–\nanswer pairs and mathematics word problems, underscores their broad applicability \nacross various educational contexts (Qu et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). \nTack and Piech (2022) provide an in-depth analysis of conversational agents in educa -\ntional dialogues, offering insights into their strengths and areas for improvement relative \nto human interactions. Additionally, Wang et  al. (2023) have pioneered an innovative \nuse of LLMs in analyzing qualitative Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) comments, \nenriching the interpretation of SET scores.\nLLMs have also been used to foster curiosity and question-asking skills among under -\ngraduate students explaining coding concepts in computing education (MacNeil et al., \n2022). Additionally, peer learning has been augmented through LLMs, as evidenced by \nJia et al. (2021), who employ Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers \n(BERT) to evaluate peer assessments, promoting a collaborative learning atmosphere. \nPage 5 of 21\nPereira et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \n \nThis body of work collectively illustrates the expanding role of LLMs in enhancing edu -\ncational practices through automation, personalized learning experiences, and support \nfor both instructors and students.\nConversational AI, including LLMs, has proven valuable in language education; it \nserves various applications such as acting as a conversational partner, addressing lan -\nguage learning anxiety, providing feedback, and offering scaffolds during language learn-\ning (Ji et al., 2022; El Shazly, 2021; Jeon, 2021; Lin & Mubarok, 2021). This diverse body \nof research underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in shaping various facets \nof the educational landscape. To our knowledge, this is the first peer-reviewed pub -\nlished work that explicitly addresses the integration of LLMs technologies in the context \nof constructive alignment within a graduate-level project management course design. \nThis study points to an untapped area of research and application where the potential of \nLLMs, particularly ChatGPT, in aligning learning outcomes, instructional strategies, and \nassessment methods remains to be explored. The proposed framework for using LLMs \naims to assist instructors in implementing a constructive alignment approach in course \ndesign and promoting a more comprehensive and application-oriented education for \nstudents.\nFramework\nConstructive alignment synergizes intended course learning outcomes, instructional \nstrategies, and assessment methods. The overarching framework for establishing con -\nstructive alignment using LLMs such as ChatGPT within higher education is illustrated \nin Fig.  1. Although there is no strict sequence for developing constructive alignment \nin a course, this study delineates a four-phase approach: Initially, in the Preliminary \nPhase, the user should focus on getting information about the course requirements and \ninput it into ChatGPT. In the Learning Outcomes Phase, the framework formulates \nthe intended learning outcomes for the course, which then transitions to designing the \nCourse Assessment Phase. The final phase involves structuring the course lecture sched-\nule and activities; we call this the Course Schedule and Active Learning Strategies Phase. \nAt each phase, there is an opportunity to revisit previous stages and check the infor -\nmation provided by ChatGPT to ensure coherence and consistency across all course \ncomponents. Furthermore, given the risks associated with the misuse of AI (IEEE, n.d.) \nas well as equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) concerns (Meyer et al., 2023) associated \nwith LLMs, users should be aware that the output from these models can be biased and \ninaccurate.\nThe prompts used in ChatGPT are based on the prompt improvement pattern sug -\ngested by White et al. (2023). In this pattern, ChatGPT is requested to ask for additional \ninformation to enhance the results. The framework proposed in this research neces -\nsitates instructor validation, ensuring that every stage is independently valuable and \ncontributes to a cohesive system that enhances learning outcomes. In addition, the criti -\ncal role of instructor oversight of ChatGPT’s answers is paramount in addressing the \nchallenge of inconsistency and variability inherent in hyper-scale LLMs. This oversight \nincludes continuous validation of the information provided by ChatGPT, ensuring the \neducational experience remains aligned, responsive, and consistently high quality.\nPage 6 of 21Pereira et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \nPhase 1: Preliminary phase\nThe first step in this framework is to gather information about the course description. \nUsually, this information is available in university calendars and course descriptions \nfrom previous years. This is also a good time to revisit the program-level learning out -\ncomes (PLOs) and any accreditation requirements to understand how the individual \ncourse fits into the overall aims of the credential program. Ultimately, each individual \ncourse supports student attainment of the PLOs.\nPhase 2: Learning outcomes phase\nUsing the information gathered during the Preliminary Phase, the user should outline \nthe course’s context and description and request from ChatGPT any additional informa-\ntion that might enhance the resultant learning outcomes of the course. This step can be \ndone multiple times (Initial Prompt – Additional Information – Refined Results) until \nthe user is satisfied with the course learning outcomes and, if relevant and available, the \naccreditation requirements and PLOs.\nPhase 3: Course assessment phase\nIn the third phase, the prompt will define the assessment methods for the course. The \ncontext is based on Phase 2 plus any additional information relevant to ChatGPT. In the \nfirst prompt in this phase, it is suggested to ask ChatGPT for any additional information \nFig. 1 Suggested constructive alignment framework to be implemented in ChatGPT\nPage 7 of 21\nPereira et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \n \nrequired to produce the results. Once again, this step can be done multiple times (Initial \nPrompt – Additional Information – Refined Results) until the user is satisfied with the \ncourse assessment methods. Once the assessment is concluded, the user can ask Chat -\nGPT to regenerate the course learning outcomes to better align with the assessment \nmethods. In addition, the user can request ChatGPT to suggest rubrics for the assess -\nments or questions for quizzes, assignments, or final exams. It is important to reinforce \nthat in this phase, the role of the instructor’s expertise is paramount. Such skill ensures \nthat the assessment methods are not only comprehensive and aligned with the learning \noutcomes but also customized to fulfill the requirements of the course.\nPhase 4: Course schedule and active learning strategies phase\nIn this phase, the focus is on constructing the course schedule and delineating active \nlearning strategies consistent with the course learning outcomes and assessment meth -\nods. Initially, users may provide additional details such as the number of classes, student \npresentations, guest lectures, and other activities planned for the course duration. Anal -\nogous to the preceding phases, users are advised to inquire about additional information \nthat might be essential to refine the results. It is crucial that the lectures align coher -\nently with the intended learning outcomes and assessment methods. Results, ideally, \nshould be organized in a tabulated format. Based on the preliminary suggestions from \nChatGPT, users can eliminate superfluous or redundant lectures and recommend top -\nics for inclusion. As a culmination of this phase, users can request ChatGPT to provide \npedagogical strategies that resonate with the course’s learning outcome and assessment \nmethods and foster active student engagement during lectures.\nShould the user determine that the course’s active learning strategies and assessment \nmethods do not coherently align with the course schedule, they can submit a revised \nprompt for further refinement. This iterative process continues until the user deems the \noutputs from ChatGPT to be in congruence with all pivotal areas of the course.\nFramework application: introduction to project management course\nTo explore the proposed framework, we employed a case study centred on a course \ninstructed by the lead author, illustrating the use of ChatGPT v.4 to structure the \ncourse’s learning outcomes, assessment methods, and teaching activities using a con -\nstructive alignment approach. Introduction to Project Management is a graduate-level \ncourse designed for Master of Engineering (MEng) students. Typically taken during \nthe first semester of their program, this course draws students from diverse engineer -\ning disciplines, including civil, mechanical, software, electrical, and petroleum engineer -\ning, providing a rich context for applying and evaluating the framework. Based on the \nProject Management Body of Knowledge, the course content covers the basic aspects of \neach of the project’s five main phases: initiation, planning, team formation, control, and \nclose-out.\nTransitioning from an online to an in-person modality, the instructor, with previous \nexperience teaching this course, faced the challenge of adapting to the dynamic class -\nroom environment and ensuring the engagement of approximately 360 students split \ninto three classes. The course calendar description is provided in Fig. 2.\nPage 8 of 21Pereira et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \nThe instructor systematically input data about the course into ChatGPT and engaged \nin conversation with the tool to assess and validate the framework using AI-generated \ncontent. The course instructor conducted and compared the results generated by Chat -\nGPT with the previous year’s course materials to evaluate the effectiveness and align -\nment of the AI-enhanced approach. This comparison involved several key steps:\nAlignment with Learning Outcomes: The instructor first reviewed the learning \noutcomes defined with the assistance of ChatGPT, comparing them to those from \nthe previous year. The focus was on ensuring that the AI-generated outcomes were \naligned with the course objectives as suggested by the department and enhanced to \nbetter support students’ understanding and mastery of the subject matter. This step \nwas crucial for validating the effectiveness of ChatGPT in refining or expanding the \neducational goals of the course.\nAssessment Methods Analysis: The instructor then examined the assessment meth -\nods, including assignments, quizzes, and exams, designed with ChatGPT’s input. \nEach AI-assisted assessment was compared against the previous year’s assessments \nto identify improvements in how well they measured student learning relative to the \ndefined outcomes.\nLecture Content Review: Finally, the course content, including lecture materials \nand teaching activities suggested by ChatGPT, was compared with that of the previ -\nous year. The instructor evaluated the relevance and comprehensiveness of the AI-\nenhanced content, looking for evidence of improvement in how well the materials \nsupported the learning outcomes.\nLearning outcomes phase\nThe initial prompt inputted into ChatGPT aimed to establish five distinct learning out -\ncomes. Along with a detailed course description, there was an emphasis on integrating \ncontent from both the sixth and seventh editions of the Project Management Body of \nKnowledge (PMBOK) book (Project Management Institute 2017, 2021). Additionally, \nthe user inquired about any additional information necessary to enhance the results for \nthe course learning outcomes, as depicted in Fig.  3. ChatGPT requested details on areas \nsuch as \"Depth of Coverage,\" \" Assessment Method,\" \"Course Duration & Intensity,\" \"Tar-\nget Audience,\" \"Prerequisites,\" and \"Key Textbooks and Resources.\" Table 1 offers a thor-\nough breakdown of these topics.\nUtilizing the parameters set by ChatGPT, a refined prompt was inputted into \nChapGPT, aiming to refine the course learning outcomes (Fig.  4). The course is struc -\ntured as an introductory exploration into engineering project management, emphasiz -\ning the practical application of fundamental concepts via group projects. It is conducted \nFig. 2 Introduction to Project Management Calendar Course Description.

No prerequisites are mandated, and \nthe PMBOK serves as the primary instructional resource. The preliminary learning out -\ncomes are presented in Table 2.\nAssessment phase\nTo align with the learning outcomes, a constructive alignment approach was adopted \nto structure the course assessment methods. An initial prompt, illustrated in Fig.  5, \nwas inputted to seek guidance on the assessment methods. Additionally, ChatGPT was \nconsulted about any additional information needed to define the assessment methods, \nFig. 3 First prompt inputted into ChatGPT to define the course learning outcomes\nTable 1 Additional information required by ChatGPT\nDepth of Coverage How in-depth do you intend to go into each topic? For example, will students \nbe expected to just understand the basics of the PMBOK or be able to apply its \nprinciples in real-world scenarios?\nAssessment Method How will students’ understanding and skills be assessed? This can shape learning \noutcomes. For instance, if there’s a practical component, a learning outcome \nmight emphasize hands-on skills\nCourse Duration & Intensity Is this a semester-long course, a quarter, or an intensive short course?

Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \nas outlined in Table  3. It is worth noting that in the initial iteration, ChatGPT rec -\nommended including a student participation and engagement mark for the course. \nHowever, we requested that this recommendation be omitted due to the challenges \nassociated with mandating student lecture attendance and the inconclusive evidence on \nwhether grading participation meaningfully improves student engagement or learning \n(Paff, 2015). This example highlights the importance of carefully reviewing of all Chat -\nGPT responses.\nAdding the information required by ChatGPT, a new prompt was inputted into \nChatGPT (Fig.  6).

Given the \ncourse’s size, individual submissions should be automatically graded, primarily through \nquizzes. Students should further apply their knowledge through a simulation game, \nwhere they plan and evaluate a specific project to assess performance, risks, and adher -\nence to time and budget constraints. Though guest lectures enhance the content, they \nare not factored into assessments.\nThe final list of assessments methods suggested by ChatGPT is presented in Table  4. \nThis list encompasses an array of assessment methods, including group presentations, \nsimulation-based exercises, quizzes, and a final exam. As requested in the prompt, each \nassessment method is aligned with specific course learning outcomes, with ChatGPT \nfurnishing an accompanying description and designated weightage.\nRevisiting the course learning outcomes\nA new prompt was inputted into ChatGPT requesting to update the course learning out-\ncomes based on the course assessment methods (Fig.  7). The list is presented in Table 5. \nFig. 6 Second prompt inputted to ChatGPT to define the course assessments methods\nTable 4 List of course assessment methods and alignment with course learning outcomes\nComponent Weight Description Aligned Learning Outcome\nGroup project & Presentation 35% Teams will select, analyze, and provide \nsolutions for a real-world engineering \nproject.

Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \nIn the first iteration, the fifth outcome emphasizes the integration of \"various aspects \nof project management\" to collaboratively develop, implement, and monitor a project \nplan that considers stakeholder needs and potential challenges; whereas, in the second \niteration, the fifth outcome highlights the synthesis and presentation of comprehensive \nproject analyses and recommendations. The second iteration focuses more on the con -\nsolidation of knowledge and presentation rather than the execution of a plan.\nMoreover, the revised version of the learning outcomes evidently incorporates ele -\nments from Bloom’s Taxonomy (Armstrong, 2010). Although employing Bloom’s \nTaxonomy in the creation of learning outcomes is widely respected, it  is not man -\ndatory to include an outcome for every level, particularly in graduate-level courses. \nFurthermore, the use of terms such as “understand” or “acquire a foundational under -\nstanding” is generally not recommended as best practice (Potter & Kustra, 2012) . \nThe update learning outcomes also introduce the explicit use of simulation tools for \nevaluating project scenarios, which is encapsulated in the fourth outcome: \"Evaluate \nProject Scenarios Using Simulation Tools.\" This learning outcome is distinct from the \nothers mentioned in the first iteration, and emerges from the assessment details sup -\nplied to ChatGPT, which showcases ChatGPT’s aptitude to recalibrate course learn -\ning outcomes in response to additional information provided by the user.\nFig. 7 Prompt inputted into ChatGPT to align course learning outcomes and assessments methods\nTable 5 ChatGPT updated list of course learning outcomes\nLearning Outcome Description\nUnderstand Fundamental Principles of Project Man-\nagement\nOutcome: Acquire a foundational understanding of \nthe principles and concepts of project management as \npresented in the PMBOK 7th and 6th editions, focusing \non core processes and knowledge areas\nAligned Assessment: Automated Quizzes, Final Exam\nApply Basic Project Management Techniques in Real-\nWorld Contexts\nOutcome: Demonstrate the ability to apply basic project \nmanagement planning and control techniques to real-\nworld engineering projects, ensuring alignment with \nscope, time, and cost objectives\nAnalyze and Reflect on Human Resource & Organiza-\ntional Dynamics\nOutcome: Recognize and critically reflect upon the sig-\nnificance of human resource considerations, leadership \nessentials, and organizational dynamics in the context of \nproject management\nAligned Assessment: Group Project & Presentation, Final \nExam\nEvaluate Project Scenarios Using Simulation Tools Outcome: Utilize simulation tools to evaluate project \nperformance, assess risks, and determine the feasibil-\nity of completing projects within set time and budget \nconstraints\nAligned Assessment: Simulation Game Performance\nSynthesize and Present Comprehensive Project \nAnalyses\nOutcome: Integrate knowledge from various aspects \nof project management to collaboratively develop, \npresent, and defend comprehensive project analyses \nand recommendations\nAligned Assessment: Group Project & Presentation\nPage 13 of 21\nPereira et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \n \nCourse schedule and active learning strategies phase\nAfter defining the course learning outcomes and assessment methods, a prompt was \ninputted to structure the course schedule (Fig.  8). The course is a 12-week course with \ntwo lectures per week. ChatGPT was asked to include guest lectures and the lectures \nused with group presentations to the course schedule. The prompt also asked for addi -\ntional information required to improve the results, as outlined in Table 6.\nUtilizing the information required by ChatGPT and based on the preliminary list of \nlecture topics, a refined prompt was inputted into ChatGPT to define the course sched -\nule and lecture content (Fig.  9). The prompt aimed for ChatGPT to refine the course \nschedule and align them with the course learning outcomes and assessment methods. \nChatGPT originally scheduled three lectures for reviewing course material, which the \ninstructors found excessive. The final list of lectures is structured in six areas: Foun -\ndations and Fundamentals, Core Project Management Techniques, Integration and \nAdvanced Topics, Guest Speakers, Student Presentations, and Course Closure. Chat -\nGPT suggested possible guest lecture topics and how they would align with the course \nlearning outcomes. The course schedule is presented in Table 7.\nIn this phase, ChatGPT included solely the content of Lecture 10 in the final exam. \nIdeally, the final exam should encompass content from all the course lectures, so stu -\ndents could be evaluated on their individual understanding of the entire course con -\ntent. When queried about this discrepancy, ChatGPT responded, “Not all content is \nincluded in the final exam due to the need for diversified assessment methods, which \nFig. 8 Prompt inputted into ChatGPT requesting to structure the lecture content\nTable 6 Additional information required to define the content of the lectures\nInformation Needed Purpose\nTopics for Guest Speakers Knowing in advance what guest speakers will focus on will help integrate their \ncontent into the broader course structure\nSpecific PMBOK Chapters While \"no specific topics\" were mentioned, knowing which PMBOK chapters \nwill be emphasized can allow for more precise lecture content\nSoftware & Tools For the simulation lectures, knowing what software or simulation tools will be \nused can guide preparation\nStudent Numbers & Group Sizes For the presentation lectures, knowing how many groups will present can help \nallocate time and ensure the presentation schedule is manageable\nFig. 9 Prompt inputted into ChatGPT requesting the final course schedule and lecture content\nPage 14 of 21Pereira et al.

Limiting exam \ncontent allows for deeper exploration of specific topics, reduces student stress, and \npromotes continuous engagement. Furthermore, practical skills or sessions focus -\ning on reflection and feedback might not align with traditional exam formats. By \nfocusing the exam on core concepts, educators ensure meaningful evaluation while \nconsidering time and logistical constraints. ” Therefore, if the instructor considers it \nnecessary, additional prompts would be required to ensure that all lecture content is \nincluded in the final exam.\nActive learning strategies\nFollowing the course schedule and lecture content definition, ChatGPT was requested \nto provide five active learning strategies that would align with the course learning activi -\nties and assessment methods (Fig.  10). Table  8 outlines five key classroom strategies \ndesigned to reinforce project management concepts. The strategies predominantly tar -\nget the learning outcome of \" Applying Basic Project Management Techniques,\" except \nfor the \"Risk Identification Activity\" in Lecture 13, which focuses on evaluating project \nscenarios using simulation tools. Each strategy is linked to specific assessment methods, \nprimarily group projects and simulation games, ensuring a holistic approach to teaching \nand evaluating fundamental project management principles.\nComparison of the framework results provided by ChatGPT with the actual course \nand discussion of its limitations\nIn this section, the results from the ChatGPT will be compared with the lead author’s \ncourse syllabus to discuss discrepancies and similarities.\nCourse learning outcomes\nThe actual course learning outcomes for the Introduction to Project Management \ncourse are presented in Table 9. Where the instructor’s approach focuses more on prac -\ntical skills such as project planning and team management, ChatGPT’s outcomes are \nbased more on a theoretical foundation, drawing from PMBOK guidelines suggested by \nthe course instructor, and incorporating broader concepts into the course learning out -\ncomes, such as human resource dynamics and simulation tools.

Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \n \nCourse assessments\nDuring the development of course assessments proposed by ChatGPT, some con -\nstraints were overlooked, such as limited teaching assistants and large class sizes that \nthe instructor faced. The recommendations provided by ChatGPT were mostly con -\nventional assessment methods, with no innovative approaches such as ungrading. The \nfinal assessment list mainly featured common assessment methods or assessments ini -\ntially suggested by the course instructor. However, it’s worth noting that the game-based \nassessment was an original idea from the course instructor, later adopted in ChatGPT’s \nsuggested assessment methods.\nCourse schedule and active learning strategies\nUpon comparing the course schedule proposed by ChatGPT with the course sched -\nule for the original course, ENGG 684: Introduction to Project Management, it was \nobserved that of the 16 lectures suggested by ChatGPT (excluding guest lectures, pres -\nentations, and final course/review exam), 13 lectures (or 81%) aligned closely or were \nidentical in content to the topics presented in the actual course.\nThe active learning strategies proposed by ChatGPT for the Introduction to Project \nManagement course are somewhat commonplace within this educational context. This \nobservation suggests that a more detailed understanding of the specific course context is \nneeded to effectively tailor and enhance these strategies. Providing additional informa -\ntion about the course’s unique aspects could enable the development of more custom -\nized and impactful active learning strategies.\nEmploying ChatGPT for constructive alignment implementation in higher education: \nadvantages, limitations, and future work.\nImplementing constructive alignment in course planning is a challenge in higher educa -\ntion. For reasons such as instructors’ lack of time (Simper, 2020), educators’ and stu -\ndents’ resistance to change (Cain & Babar, 2016), and lack of institutional support (Ruge \net  al., 2019), achieving the desired integration and coherence across curriculum com -\nponents can be difficult. Amidst these challenges, the advent of AI and LLMs in educa -\ntion presents a transformative opportunity. As highlighted by Holmes et al. (2019), AI \ntechnologies offer the promise of personalizing learning and streamlining educational \nprocesses, a promise that ChatGPT has begun to fulfill through its adaptive learning \nalgorithms and feedback integration capabilities. Unlike traditional AI tools discussed \nby Luckin & Holmes (2016), which primarily focus on static content delivery, ChatGPT’s \nreinforcement learning mechanism allows it to continually refine course structures \nbased on iterative feedback, thus providing a dynamic tool for educators in the initial \nstages of aligning course learning outcomes, assessments, and activities. In this scenario, \nthe framework proposed in this research using ChatGPT can reduce the time instruc -\ntors spend on initial course planning, provide a starting point for the syllabus creation, \nand enable more focus on customization and direct student engagement. This aspect \nof ChatGPT is particularly beneficial in the complex and often time-intensive task of \ncreating or revising graduate-level courses. Furthermore, given that constructive align -\nment has been shown to facilitate deeper learning and improve student performance \nin courses (Vanfretti & Farrokhbadi, 2014), applying this framework could result in \nPage 18 of 21Pereira et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \nenhanced academic outcomes, including increased student engagement, higher achieve -\nment levels, and a more profound understanding of course material.\nThe framework can also enhance the implementation of constructive alignment \nin higher education by facilitating integration with existing pedagogical models. For \ninstance, the EdVEE model by Trowsdale and McKay (2023), enhances the visualiza -\ntion and sharing of the alignment among learning outcomes, content, teaching activities, \nand assessments, could be integrated with the proposed framework to assist instructors \nin defining course learning outcomes, assessments, and schedule. The framework can \nalso be integrated into the serious game design principles outlined by Kalmpourtzis and \nRomero (2020). This integration could assist in defining learning outcomes and align \nthem with the context of game-based learning environments, demonstrating the frame -\nwork’s adaptability and potential to enhance educational practices through a variety of \nteaching methodologies and tools.\nDespite some advantages, the use of ChatGPT in constructing graduate courses comes \nwith notable limitations. As Kasneci et al. explain, “a clear strategy within educational \nsystems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and \nstrategies for fact-checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of LLMs \nin learning and assessment settings and teaching curricula” (2023, p. 1). Therefore, the \nsuggestions provided by ChatGPT in the Introduction to Project Management course, \nwhile useful, often lack the specificity and contextual awareness necessary for effective \nimplementation in diverse classroom settings. For instance, the recommended active \nlearning activities and assessments may not account for limitations such as class size and \nresource availability, such as the number of teaching assistants. Implementing these sug-\ngestions without modifications could lead to practical challenges. Furthermore, while \nChatGPT can provide a starting point for developing the course learning outcomes, \nassessment, and schedule, it still requires substantial input and validation from an expe -\nrienced course instructor. The tool’s suggestions are often generic and may not align per-\nfectly with the unique requirements of a specific course or its students. Therefore, the \nrole of the instructor remains crucial in customizing and finalizing the course structure; \nthe instructor must ensure that the outcomes, assessments, and activities are not only \naligned but also practically feasible and contextually relevant. In addition, users should \nbe aware of the potential biases in LLMs, as highlighted by Meyer et al. (2023), and the \nrisk of data privacy breaches, as cautioned by the IEEE (n.d.), when providing sensitive \nor personal information. It is essential to exercise discretion and implement robust data \nprotection measures to safeguard against unauthorized access to personal information \nfrom organizations, students, and personnel, and ensure the ethical use of technology.\nThe framework introduced in this research opens several paths for future explora -\ntion. First, future research can focus on how to craft detailed prompts that incorporate \nEDI into learning outcomes, assessments, and course schedules, and thereby enhance \nsupport for students from minority groups. Second, the framework offers scope for \nexpansion to include the creation of rubrics designed for diverse course assessments, \nproviding a systematic approach to evaluation. Third, there is an opportunity to exam -\nine the framework’s suitability for courses with scarce online materials, evaluating its \nadaptability and versatility. Lastly, given the varied accreditation standards of higher-\neducation courses, the framework can be adapted to encompass the graduate attributes \nPage 19 of 21\nPereira et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ           (2024) 21:25 \n \nrequired by accrediting organizations, ensuring its broad relevance and utility in differ -\nent educational settings.\nConclusion\nExploring constructive alignment in educational frameworks highlights the importance \nof structured instructional design. The framework suggested in this paper implemented \nthrough a case study in the Introduction to Project Management course showcases how \nChatGPT model processes align with the constructive alignment proposed by Biggs \n(1996). The case study shows that this framework offers a potential method for aligning \ncourse learning outcomes, assessment methods, and active learning classroom activities \nwith the course schedule. The course schedule is more than 80% similar to the original \ncourse, and the assessment methods are aligned with the course schedule and learning \noutcomes.\nTherefore, the proposed framework can be adopted by other instructors to examine \nthe outcomes of LLMs such as ChatGPT in diverse educational contexts. If proven via -\nble, this framework has the potential to decrease the workload for instructors and help \nthem adopt a constructive approach in course design.\nWhile the proposed framework offers promising insights, it is essential to recognize \nthe inherent challenges of LLMs, including occasional lapses in context comprehension \nand potential inaccuracies, which underline the importance of human intervention and \nreview. The strengths of the LLMs system in this application to course design were bal -\nanced with the authors’ nuanced understanding of project management principles and \nteaching expertise. It is also worth noting that this study centered on a single course, lim-\niting its broader applicability. As LLMs technologies continue to advance, the relevance \nand implications of these findings will most likely necessitate revisiting and updating.\nAcknowledgements\nGratitude is extended to two anonymous reviewers whose valuable feedback contributed to enhancing the quality of \nthis work.\nAuthors’ contributions\nThe authors confirm their contribution to the paper as follows: study conception and design: Estacio Pereira; data collec-\ntion: Estacio Pereira; analysis and interpretation of results: Estacio Pereira, Sumaya Nsair, Leticia Radin Pereira, Kimberley \nGrant; draft manuscript: Estacio Pereira, Sumaya Nsair, Leticia Radin Pereira.
