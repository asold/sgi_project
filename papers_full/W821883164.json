Their\nintrinsic mechanical and electrical properties together\nwith their abundance and straightforward use in the\nmanufacturing process have made them a universal\nchoice. A typical power transformer contains around\n12,000 kg of cellulose per 40,000 kg of oil and\noperates at temperatures ranging from 60 to 105 /C176C\n(Emsley 1994; Jalbert et al. 2007, 2009).

The combined action of temperature,\noxygen and moisture causes the oil and the oil-\nimpregnated insulation material to decompose and to\ngenerate gaseous decomposition products dissolved in\nthe mineral oil. This degradation causes a loss of\nmechanical properties of the cellulose insulation and\ncould ultimately result in a loss of the equipment due\nto a short-circuit between conductors. Therefore, it is\nessential to monitor cellulose degradation in order to\nensure proper transformer operation. However,\ndirectly evaluating the condition of cellulose insula-\ntion in a working transformer, e.g. through a mea-\nsurement of the degree of polymerization (DP\nv), is\ndifﬁcult and impractical. Such direct evaluation would\nrequire shutting down, opening, and untanking the\ntransformer to ﬁnally be able to collect representative\nsamples of insulating paper. Indirect evaluation,\nwhich consists of sampling the transformer oil, is\nsimple, economical and non-intrusive.\nThe cellulose degradation products are generated\nby hydrolysis, oxidation and thermal degradation.\nThese mechanisms are not independent of each other;\nthey could coexist and even be in competition inside a\ntransformer (Emsley and Stevens 1994). Some of the\nﬁrst efforts aimed at identifying indirect indicators of\ncellulose degradation, ‘‘chemical markers,’’ included\ndetermining carbon oxide and carbon dioxide levels\n(Kelly 1980; Tamura et al. 1981) along with a family\nof furanic compounds such as 5-hydroxymethyl-2-\nfuraldehyde, furfuryl alcohol, 2-furaldehyde, 2-acetyl\nfuran, and 5-methyl-2-furaldehyde present in oil\n(Burton et al. 1984; Unsworth and Mitchell 1990).\nNonetheless, it has been reported that the presence of\ncarbon oxides might not only be speciﬁc to paper\ndegradation but also to oil ageing (Blue et al. 1998;\nLevchik et al. 1998). The presence of furanic\ncompounds has been shown to be more speciﬁc to\npaper degradation. However, their instability, trace\noccurrence, humidity dependence, and possible\nderivation from other paper components hamper their\nuse as universal indicators of cellulose degradation\n(Emsley 1994; Lundgaard et al. 2004).\nRecent studies indicate the presence of methanol\n(MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH) during the ageing of oil-\nimpregnated paper which could be serve as chemical\nmarkers (Jalbert et al. 2007; Ryadi et al. 2011;\nRodriguez-Celis et al. 2012). For the ﬁrst time, a\nlinear relationship between the generated methanol\nand depolymerization of cellulose (rupture of 1,4- b-\nglycosidic bonds) was established (Jalbert et al.2007).\nLater on, kinetic studies of the degradation of standard\nwood kraft and thermally upgraded insulating paper\nprovided additional conﬁrmation that methanol orig-\ninates from the cellulose chopped-end chains (Gilbert\net al.2008, 2009; Jalbert et al.2015). New studies have\nconﬁrmed the applicability of methanol as a new\nmarker for paper degradation in power transformers\n(Schaut et al. 2011; Jalbert et al. 2012a) and an\nanalytical methodology is available for the determi-\nnation of these two alcohols in transformer oil, with\ndetection limits in the low ng g\n-1 concentration level\n(Jalbert et al. 2012b).\nAlthough there are many studies that promote the\nuse of methanol as a marker of early stage paper\ndegradation, the mechanism responsible for ethanol\nproduction in transformer oil is not yet understood.\nBoth alcohols have been observed as products of the\nageing of both standard Kraft and upgraded papers,\nregardless of the ageing conditions (temperature,\nhumidity, air, etc.). Typically, during laboratory paper\nageing at temperatures\\210 /C176C and during the routine\nanalysis of transformer oil, the concentration of\nmethanol is always higher than for ethanol, which is\ngenerated at a lower rate than methanol but stabilized\nat about the same time (Jalbert et al.2007, 2015; Ryadi\net al. 2011). This probably corresponds to an ordinary\nageing where acid hydrolysis is the predominant\nreaction pathway. The reverse tendency, EtOH [\nMeOH, has only been reported in 10 % of real\ntransformer samples (Ryadi et al. 2011) regardless of\ntransformer design (core vs. shell) and not during the\nroutine analysis of transformer oil.\nTo gain a better understanding of this behavior, this\npaper further investigates cellulose degradation at\nhigher temperatures in an effort to grasp the ethanol\nversus methanol formation from insulating paper in\npower transformers. This particular generation of\nethanol might become a new diagnosis tool of a\nspeciﬁc solid insulation event in the transformer.\nSince cellulose is the major component of cell walls\nin plants, there is great interest in cellulose pyrolysis\nfor biomass conversion. Cellulose pyrolysis has been\nalso widely studied for the chemical utilization of\n3226 Cellulose (2015) 22:3225–3236\n123\nwood pyrolysis products and ﬁre-related issues. Cel-\nlulose pyrolysis reactions usually take place at tem-\nperatures higher than 250–300 /C176C; at lower\ntemperatures there is water elimination, the formation\nof some double bonds, and cross-linking reactions.\nVarious paths to account for the products of cellulose\npyrolysis have been reported in the literature (Shaﬁ-\nzadeh and Fu 1973; Piskorz et al. 1986; Funazukuri\net al. 1988; Emsley and Stevens 1994; Perveen et al.\n2008). Perhaps the most widely accepted pyrolysis\nmechanism consists of an activation step without\nweight loss followed by up to three competing\nirreversible ﬁrst-order reactions which lead to weight\nloss (Piskorz et al. 1986; Diebold 1994). The ﬁrst of\nthese reactions (Diebold mechanism) involves the\ndepolymerization of cellulose which consists of the\nsplitting of glycosidic bonds to yield volatile products\n(primary vapors). The second reaction could form\ndirectly secondary gases, and the third reaction\ninvolves dehydration which yields char and water\n(Diebold 1994). Dehydration is important at low\ntemperatures and slow heating rates while depolymer-\nization becomes signiﬁcant at higher temperatures,\nshort times, and high heating rates (Piskorz et al.\n1986). In a recent publication (Lin et al. 2009), the\nauthors present a mechanism that consists in a series of\nreactions instead of three parallel pathways. They\nsuggest that cellulose becomes ‘‘active’’ followed by\ndecomposition into anhydro-oligosaccharides and\nthen to levoglucosan formation. The latter undergoes\ndehydration and isomerization to form other mole-\ncules that could later form volatiles, carbon monoxides\nand char. The authors indicate that depolymerization\noccurs at temperatures as low as 100–150 /C176C.\nIn this study, pyrolysis was coupled with gas\nchromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for a\nquick and efﬁcient identiﬁcation of the volatile\npyrolysis products. Only ﬂash pyrolysis is considered,\nwhich involves heating rates in milliseconds. The fast\npyrolysis of paper was carried out using a commercial\ninstrument with mg sample capacity under an inert gas\natmosphere (He). The goal of this work is to determine\nif ethanol is a by-product of pyrolysis and to identify\nthermal degradation products that could serve as\nindicators of localized high temperature of the solid\ninsulation (hot-spots) in power transformers. The\npyrolysis results are compared with thermal ageing\nof some cellulose model compounds (glucose,\nlevoglucosan and cellobiose).\nExperimental section\nChemicals\nA standard 100 % wood kraft insulating paper, Mun-\nskjo¨ electrical grade (Munskjo¨ , Stockholm, Sweden)\nwith a thickness of 45–55 lm and average viscometric\ndegree of polymerization (DP\nv)o f *1200, was used in\nthe experiments. Pyrolysis samples were prepared by\nslicing the paper into 1.0 9 0.2-cm strips. Each strip\nhad an approximate weight of 1 mg. The paper samples\nwere placed in a vacuum desiccator containing anhy-\ndrous calcium sulfate (Drierite) prior to pyrolysis.\nMethanol extra dry 99.9 % (Acros Organics\nBVBA, Geel, Belgium), ethanol 99.9 % (Les Alcools\nde Commerce, Montre´al, Canada) and cellulose model\ncompounds\nD-(?)-cellobiose, D-(?)-glucose and 1,6-\nanhydro-b-D-glucose (levoglucosan), all products\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, Canada),\nwere also used in the experiments. Inhibited electrical\ninsulating oil, LuminolTM TR-i (Petro-Canada Lubri-\ncants Inc, Mississauga, Canada) was used in the\nthermal ageing experiments.\nApparatus\nA coil pyrolysis unit (CDS Pyroprobe 2000 and its\nCDS 1500 Interface) was connected to a split/splitless\ninjector (50:1 at 250 /C176C) of a 6890 gas chromatograph\n(GC) equipped with a 5973 mass spectrometer (MS)\noperating at 70 eV ionization energy in the electron\nionization mode (GC and MS both from Agilent\nTechnologies). The chromatography separation was\nperformed on a 60-m-DB-624 (Agilent J&W) column,\n0.250 mm in diameter, with a ﬁlm thickness of\n1.4 lm. The gas carrier ﬂow ranged from 1.2 to\n1.5 mL min\n-1 and the column temperature from 25\nto 260 /C176C. The mass spectrometer interface was\nmaintained at 230 /C176C, with a mass range of\nm/z = 30–300 amu, and scanned in total ion count\nmode (TIC) at a rate of 5.10 scans per second. The\npyrolyzer heating element was made of platinum wire\nformed into a coil approximately 15 mm in length by\n3 mm in diameter. The integrated GC–MS data\nanalysis software (MSD ChemStation v.E.02.00.493)\nallowed the ions of the unknown peaks to be matched\nto the ions of a NIST MS library (NIST11) installed on\nthe system.\nCellulose (2015) 22:3225–3236 3227\n123\nMeasurements of the average viscometric degree of\npolymerization (DP v) were made based on ASTM\nstandard D4243.\nPyrolysis procedure\nExperiments were performed by bringing the CDS 1500\ninterface to the operating temperature (250 /C176C). Once\nthis temperature was attained, samples of approximately\n1 mg were introduced into the quartz tube (0.3 mm\nthick, 25 mm long), which was plugged with quartz\nwool and inserted into the coil probe. The use of quartz\nwool on both sides of the samples provides a surface area\nfor the cellulose tar to collect before penetrating into the\nGC pneumatics (Wampler, personal communication).\nThe quartz tube also allows samples to remain in the\ncenter of the tube to ensure reproducibility during the\npyrolysis experiment. The probe is then inserted into the\nhot interface and sealed with the valve in the LOAD\nposition. A purge ﬂow of Helium gas at 20 mL min\n-1\nwas connected to the purge input of the interface. This\nﬂow is intended to remove the presence of air from the\ninterface before pyrolysis, and siloxanes that could\noriginate from the probe septum during the experiment\n(Wampler, personal communication). Thirty seconds\nafter the sample is introduced into the interface, the\nvalve is switched to theRUN position, and once the GC\ninlet pressure is stable, pyrolysis (at the desired\ntemperature and duration) starts simultaneously with\nGC separation. Approximately a minute after pyrolysis,\nthe sample is removed with the valve again set atLOAD.\nDue to the large amount of generated vapour, high\ninjection split ratios are used in pyrolysis to limit the\namount of sample going into the GC but also to sweep\nthe sample out of the interface, thus minimizing\ncarryover. The inlet liner (straight, ultra inert, 990lL)\nwas changed regularly to avoid cross-contamination.\nPyrolysis of the paper strips and solid cellulose model\ncompounds was performed at different ﬁlament set-point\ntemperatures (25 /C176C intervals from 250 to 475 /C176C) in\ntriplicate. Each test corresponds to the 20-s pyrolysis of a\nsingle paper strip. The paper samples were weighed\nbefore and after pyrolysis. To assess the change of DP\nv\nduring pyrolysis, multiple paper samples were pyrolyzed\nunder the above conditions in order to gather enough\nsample weight for the DPv measurements (*100 mg).\nCalibration curves for methanol and ethanol were\nprepared from aqueous solutions of 25–320 lgg -1.\nThese solutions (1 lL) were injected into the GC.\nThermal ageing studies\nThese studies involved ageing 0.5 g of the studied\nmaterial (cellobiose, glucose and levoglucosan) with\n9 mL of oil placed in 20-mL glass ampoules. The\nampoules were sealed and placed in an oven at\nconstant temperature for 1 week (168 h). Two tem-\nperatures were chosen (60 and 130 /C176C) and studies\nwere done in triplicate. Besides being aged in regular\noil, levoglucosan was aged at 130 /C176C in water and in\nacidiﬁed oil (0.1 mg KOH g\n-1 oil) under air atmo-\nsphere, and in oil under nitrogen atmosphere. After the\nageing period, the ampoules were opened and 5 mL of\noil was analyzed for alcohol content by an in-house\nHS–GC–MS (Agilent Technologies) method (Jalbert\net al. 2012a). The samples were also analyzed for\n2-FAL using high-performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy (Agilent Technologies, 1100 Series) based on a\nmethod adapted from Lessard et al. 1995).\nViscometric degree of polymerization (DP\nv)\nMeasurements of the average DPv were made at IREQ\nbased on ASTM standard D4243.\nFTIR measurements\nFourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was\nperformed on a Nicolet 4700 spectrometer (Thermo\nElectron Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) using the\nattenuated total reﬂection (ATR) accessory. The\ninstrument resolution was 4 cm\n-1.\nSafety considerations\nAlthough no problems were encountered during the\npyrolysis studies, appropriate safety measures are\nrecommended when working with a high-temperature\npyrolysis probe.\nResults and discussion\nNormalization of pyrolysis temperatures\nAs indicated in the experimental section, the set-point\ntemperature is the nominal temperature of the plat-\ninum ﬁlament calibrated by the manufacturer. The\nheat is initially transferred from the ﬁlament to the\n3228 Cellulose (2015) 22:3225–3236\n123\nquartz tube and then to the paper sample. Therefore, a\ndifference between the real pyrolysis temperature and\nthe nominal ﬁlament temperature (set-point) is\nexpected due to heat transfer losses. It has been\nreported that this difference becomes signiﬁcant for\npyrolysis experiments \\5 s long (Funazukuri et al.\n1987). The instrument manufacturer (CDS Analytical\nInc.) indicates that the real pyrolysis temperature\ndepends on sample size and type, and it is approxi-\nmately 100 /C176C lower than the ﬁlament set-point\ntemperature. The manufacturer also mentions that\nthe observed difference is smaller at lower set-point\ntemperatures. Studies on the heating characteristics of\nﬁlament-type pyrolysis instruments are available in\nthe literature (Inger 1980; Funazukuri et al. 1987). A\ntemperature standardization procedure based on the\nratio of isoprene/dipentene, two degradation products\nfrom the pyrolysis of Kraton, is available for ﬂash\npyrolysis (Levy and Walker 1984). However, this\nmethodology has been proposed for experiments\nwhere the pyrolysis temperatures are higher than\n600 /C176C.\nDuring the weight loss experiments, we observed\nthat our samples started to exhibit a signiﬁcant weight\nloss at set-point temperatures above 350/C176C. However,\nmost pyrolysis studies of cellulose report weight loss\nat temperatures as low as 300 /C176C (Moldoveanu 1998),\nwhich is in agreement with a thermogravimetric\nanalysis (TGA) of a similar insulation paper, Munskjo¨\nTH70. To estimate and make adjustments for differ-\nences between the ﬁlament set-point and the real\npyrolysis temperatures, TGA data were compared\nwith the remaining weight after paper pyrolysis. A plot\nof these temperature differences (not shown) for the\nsame ﬁnal weight versus the ﬁlament set-point tem-\nperatures yielded a linear correlation which was used\nto make corrections for the real pyrolysis temperature.\nThis difference increased with temperature; for exam-\nple, an experiment at a set-point temperature of\n350 /C176C corresponded to a pyrolysis at 310 /C176C. From\nthis point onward, the corrected temperature will be\nreferred to as the pyrolysis temperature.\nChanges in weight, degree of polymerization\nand FTIR characterization\nThe percentage weight loss was calculated as the\ndifference in sample weight after pyrolysis divided by\nthe initial weight and multiplied by 100. Figure 1\npresents the weight lost during the pyrolysis experi-\nments as a function of temperature. This weight loss\nbehaviour, which corresponds to a pure pyrolytic\nageing mechanism, differs from the trend observed for\na similar standard Kraft paper, aged in oil. In Table 4\nof their study (Jalbert et al. 2015) these authors show\nthat after 14 h of ageing at 210 /C176C, a DP\nv of 133 was\nreached with an observable weight loss of only 1 %. It\nwas noted by these authors that a pyrolysis-like\nmechanism in conjunction with acid hydrolysis was\npresent in their ageing systems. Conversely, when\nonly pyrolysis is present, weight loss shows an\nexponential increase with temperature. Figure 2\nshows the changes in the physical appearance of the\npaper specimens before and after pyrolysis. As seen in\nthis ﬁgure, there is a gradual increase of dark-brown\ncoloring, and starting at 320 /C176C the remaining paper is\nblack and extremely fragile and brittle.\nThe DP\nv accounts for the number of polymerized\nglucose rings. New cellulosic paper has a DP v of\n*1200; a value of 150–200 indicates the end of its\nuseful life where the transformer’s paper has no\nmechanical strength left resulting in a possible fault if\nmechanical stress occurs. The average number of\ncellulose scissions is calculated as DP\nv_initial/DPv_ﬁnal - 1.\nFigure 3 presents the changes in DP v and the number\nof scissions with the increasing pyrolysis temperature.\nIn our experiments, depolymerization is already\npresent, with 50 % of its original value at 250 /C176C,\nand it probably starts at a lower temperature. In this\nﬁgure, it is possible to observe that there are three\ntrends during the decrease of DP v with pyrolysis\n250 275 300 325 350 375\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPyrolysis temperature (°C)\nWeight loss (%)\nFig. 1 Weight loss during pyrolysis of Munskjo¨ paper\nCellulose (2015) 22:3225–3236 3229\n123\ntemperature. First, there is an attenuation of DP v at\ntemperatures below 300 /C176C, which corresponds to a\nminimum change of weight and appearance of the\npaper. Since 250 /C176C is the ﬁrst studied degradation\ntemperature, it is not possible to determine the role of\nthe weak links (*4 % of initial DPv) during pyrolysis.\nThis value was determined after a paper reduction\ntreatment with borane tert-butylamine complex\n(TBAB) (Bicchieri et al. 1999). From 290 to 320 /C176C,\nthere is a rapid decrease of DP\nv, the weight starts\ndecreasing, and the damage in the paper is more\nevident. At approximately 320 /C176C, the DP v of the\npaper is already below 170, its LODP (levelling-off\ndegree of polymerization) (Gilbert et al. 2009). Once\nthe LODP is attained, the decrease of DP\nv seems to\ncontinue at a lower pace, while the weight loss keeps\nincreasing and the paper is completely carbonized.\nMid-FTIR spectroscopy is used to monitor the\nstructural and chemical changes in cellulose during\npyrolysis. Figure 4 presents a superposition of FTIR\nspectra for Munskjo¨ pyrolyzed at 310 and 330 /C176C and\ncompared to a new paper.

The band at 1640 cm -1 found in\nthe new paper disappeared. This band corresponds to\nthe bending vibration of adsorbed water molecules\nthat typically masks the conjugated C=O band\n(Łojewska et al. 2005). At higher pyrolysis tempera-\ntures, two new bands are better deﬁned at 1590 and\n1700 cm-1, which correspond to C=C and C=O\nstretching, respectively. However, the glucose ring\nstretch bands at 890 and 1110 cm\n-1 are still present.\nOur FTIR ﬁndings are in agreement with a study of\ncellulose char in anaerobic conditions from 190 to\n390 /C176C (Pastorova et al. 1994).\nSince these pyrolysis experiments at different\ntemperatures were done at a constant time (20 s), it\nis not possible to elaborate on the cellulose degrada-\ntion kinetics for each temperature. However, our\nﬁndings conﬁrm that dehydration and depolymeriza-\ntion play an important role and occur simultaneously\nduring the range of studied temperatures.\nIdentiﬁcation of pyrolysis products\nWhen identifying potential chemical markers of\ncellulose degradation by accelerated ageing in oil,\nthere is the limitation of the partitioning effect of these\nmolecules in the two phases in contact (paper/oil),\nwhich causes signal ﬂuctuations as there is an increase\nof oxidation products in the oil during the course of\nageing. This partitioning effect is not an issue when\nworking in pyrolysis mode. Moreover, the products\nidentiﬁed by pyrolysis are readily available as they are\ngenerated just seconds before the beginning of the\nchromatographic separation and they are characteris-\ntic of the starting material, cellulose, since there is an\nabsence of any other ageing matrix such as oil. The\nrelative high pyrolysis temperatures could contribute\nto identifying the product characteristic of an unusual\nhigh temperature inside a transformer.\nTable 1 lists the compounds identiﬁed during the\npaper pyrolysis experiments. The symbol H indicates\nthat the compound was present at the chosen temper-\nature with a conﬁdence level higher than 35 %.\nAlthough weight loss at 250, 275 and 288 /C176C was\nminimal (*5 %), the number of compounds for these\ntemperatures increased signiﬁcantly with the temper-\nature. In general, the higher the pyrolysis temperature,\nthe larger the number of molecules and their yields in\nthe total ion chromatogram (TIC). As seen in this\ntable, the identiﬁed molecules consisted of alcohols,\ncarbonyl compounds, furans, acids, esters, and anhy-\ndrosugars, as well as other molecules such as sulfur\ndioxide, chloromethane and methanethiol. Most of\nthese molecules are of the same type as those reported\nin the literature for cellulose pyrolysis (Moldoveanu\n1998).\nIn ﬁeld transformer analysis, is not rare to encoun-\nter methanol and ethanol (Ryadi et al. 2011). In a\nrecent study (Rodriguez-Celis et al. 2012), some of\nthese products (methanol, ethanol, furan, hydroxy-\nacetaldehyde, 2-methyl-furan and furfural) were iden-\ntiﬁed in distribution and power transformer oil sam-\nples. Acetaldehyde, acetone and acetic acid were also\npresent in the transformer oil but they are not exclusive\nto paper degradation (Rodriguez-Celis et al. 2012)a s\nthey are also products of oil degradation.\nMethanol has already been reported in pyrolysis\nstudies of microcrystalline cellulose (Funazukuri et al.\n1987, 1988), wood pyrolysis at 250 /C176C (Degroot et al.\n1988) and as a pyrolysis product (low yield) of 1,6-\nanhydro-a-\nD-glucopyranose (levoglucosan) at 600 /C176C\n(Shaﬁzadeh 1982). It was also identiﬁed during the\npyrolysis of lignin at 650 /C176C (Caballero et al. 1997),\nalthough the authors mentioned that its production\ndecreases with increasing pyrolysis temperature.\nAlthough numerous studies are available on the\n4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1640\n1050\n2900\n% Transmittance\nWavenumbers (cm\n-1\n)\n New, DPv 1200\n 310°C, DPv 283\n 330°C, DPv 98\n3300\n1700\n1590\n890\n1110\nFig. 4 FTIR spectra of Munskjo¨ paper, new and pyrolyzed for\n20 s\nCellulose (2015) 22:3225–3236 3231\n123\nTable 1 Identiﬁcation of pyrolysis by-products in the TIC-chromatogram recorded from the sampling of Munsjko ¨ at different\npyrolysis temperatures\nRet. \ntime \nCompounds identified % match\n250 275 288 299 309 319 329 339 348 359\n5.14 sulfur dioxide √√√√√√√ 4 7\n5.38 chloromethane √√√√ 7 4\n6.45 acetaldehyde √√√√√√√√ 8 3\n6.96 methanethiol √√√√√√√√√√ 9 7\n7.09 methyl alcohol √√√√√√√√√√ 9 5\n10.85 ethyl alcohol √√√√ 8 2\n11.09 furan √√√√√√√ 9 2\n11.69 2-propenal √√√√ 9 6\n12.09 propanal √√√√√√ 7 8\n12.65 acetone √√√√√√ 8 9\n17.46 2,3-dihydro-furan √√√√√ 5 8\n19.23 2-methyl-furan √√√√√√ 6 0\n20.20 2,3-butanedione √√√√√√√√ 5 8\n20.53 2-butanone √√√√√√√ 8 7\n21.38 hydroxy-acetaldehyde √√√√√√√√√√ 8 4\n24.14 acetic acid √√√√√√ 8 3\n24.37 2-butenal √√√√√√√ 3 8\n25.67 2,5-dimethyl furan √√√√√ 9 1\n26.34 1-hydroxy-2-propanone √√√√√√√√√√ 7 7\n26.47 2,3-pentadione √√√√√ 8 7\n28.84 propanoic acid √√√√√ 9 2\n29.79 1,2-ethanediol √√√√√√√√√ 9 8\n29.96 2-methyl-furan √√√√√√√ 4 9\n31.11 1,2-ethanediol, monoacetate √√√√√√√√√ 3 7\n31.33 1-hydroxy-2-butanone √√√√√√√√√ 8 0\n32.59 propanoic acid, 2-oxo-, methyl ester √√√√√√√√√ 5 9\n32.96 3-furaldehyde √√√√√√ 4 9\n34.10 furfural √√√√√√√√√√ 7 9\n34.20 2-cyclopenten-1-one √√√√√√ 8 3\n35.24 2-furfuryl alcohol √√√√√√√√√√ 7 5\n35.52 2-propanone, 1-acetyloxy √√√√√√ 6 3\n36.83 2(3H)-furanone, dihydro-4-hydroxy √ √ 39\n37.02 2-cyclopentene-1,4dione √√√√√ 8 0\n37.12 2-acetyl furan √√√√√√√ 6 3\n37.99 2 - c y c l o p e n t e n - 1 - o n e ,  2 - h y d r o x y √√√√√√√√ 7 3\n38.60 2(3H)-furanone, 5-methyl √√√√√ 3 5\n39.06 2(5H)-furanone √√√√√√√√√√ 8 6\n39.20 5 - m e t h y l - 2 - f u r a l d e h y d e √√√√√√√ 8 5\n39.77 2,5-furandione, 3-methyl- √√√√√ 5 0\n45.74 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-à-d-glucopyranose √√√√√ 9 0\n45.89 2,3-anhydro-d-mannosan √√√√√ 4 2\n46.22 2-furancarboxaldehyde, 5(hydroxymethyl) √√√√√√√ 9 5\n51.40 1,6-anhydro-α-D-glucopyranose (levoglucosan) √√√√√√√√ 4 8\n53.76 1,6-Anhydro-α-d-galactofuranose √√√√ 7 0\nPyrolysis Temperature (°C)\n3232 Cellulose (2015) 22:3225–3236\n123\nenzymatic bioconversion of biomass into ethanol\n(Wayman et al. 1992; Srinivas et al. 1995; Oh et al.\n1996; Rocha et al. 2013), references for ethanol, as a\ndirect cellulose pyrolysis product, were not found. In a\nrecent study (Jalbert et al. 2015) on the ageing of\npaper/oil systems at temperatures between 120 and\n210 /C176C, ethanol is present as a degradation product;\nhowever, the ratio of methanol/ethanol concentrations\nis always higher than unity. Figure 5 shows the\ngeneration of these two alcohols with increasing\npyrolysis temperature. The plotted signal corresponds\nto the integrated intensity for extracted ion m/z 31\nnormalized by the initial sample weight ( *1 mg) as\nwell as the number of moles of alcohol obtained per\nmass of paper. Methanol is observed at all the studied\ntemperatures. Figure 5a shows two trends for metha-\nnol production. At temperatures lower than 300 /C176C,\nmethanol is generated at a slower pace, but as the\ntemperature increases, there is a more obvious gener-\nation. Even though ethanol is also identiﬁed during\npyrolysis, its occurrence is only at set-point temper-\natures higher than 330 /C176C, *DP\nv 100 (Fig. 5b) and its\nyield is lower than for methanol. Larger amounts of\npaper samples were pyrolyzed to conﬁrm its appear-\nance at only higher temperatures and not due to a lack\nof sensitivity at detection. Figure 6 shows the depen-\ndence of methanol on the number of chain-end groups\nin cellulose. The concentration of cellulose chains in\nthe paper samples was calculated as suggested by\nWhitmore and Bogard ( 1994). For DP\nv values higher\nthan the LODP, it is possible to model the ﬁrst portion\nof the methanol relation within a linear function. A\nlinear relationship between the broken cellulose\nchains and the amount of methanol has already been\nreported (Jalbert et al.2007). Once the degradation has\nattained the LODP value, a downward curvature\nappears in the graphic, which could be explained by\nfewer methanol molecules produced once in the more\nstable crystalline region. Although a linear relation-\nship exists between the generation of methanol and the\nconcentration of broken bonds, the amount of\nmethanol does not follow a 1:1 ratio with the\nconcentration of chain-end groups, as demonstrated\nelsewhere (Jalbert et al. 2007, 2015; Gilbert et al.\n2008, 2009). Since these experiments are performed\nwithout oil, methanol partition within the oil matrix is\nnot responsible for its low production yield. This\nmeans that pyrolysis is not the preferred route of\nmethanol formation since a higher yield was observed\nduring accelerated paper ageing studies in oil.\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nPyrolysis temperature (°C)\nIntegrated intensity x 104, m/z 31\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n µmol CH3CH2OH / g of paper \na\nb\n330 340 350 360\n250 275 300 325 350 375\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nIntegrated intensity x 105, m/z 31\n  µmol CH3OH / g of paper \nPyrolysis temperature (°C)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nFig. 5 Generation of methanol ( a) and ethanol ( b) with\npyrolysis temperature\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\nLODP 171 at 319°C\nmol CH3OH / g of paper\nChain-end groups ( mol/g of paper)\nFig. 6 Production of methanol with the number of chain-end\ngroups\nCellulose (2015) 22:3225–3236 3233\n123\nA family of anhydrosugars (1,4:3,6-dianhydro-a-D-\nglucopyranose, 2,3-anhydro- D-manossan, 1,6-anhy-\ndro-a-D-glucopyranose, and 1,6-anhydro-a-D-galacto-\nfuranose) was also observed during pyrolysis\nexperiments. Among these by-products, the most\nrecurrent one is 1,6-anhydro- a-D-glucopyranose, also\nknown as levoglucosan, which was observed at\ntemperatures above 290 /C176C in our experiments.\nLevoglucosan is the most common product of depoly-\nmerization by transglycosidation, which is considered\nthe main initial reaction in cellulose pyrolysis\n(Moldoveanu 1998). It was observed during laboratory\nageing of Kraft paper in oil at 150 /C176C by analysis of\nthe aqueous extracts by ion chromatography (Lessard\net al. 1996). Consequently, this molecule would be an\nideal marker of cellulose thermal degradation. Unfor-\ntunately, it has a low solubility in oil and an analytical\ntechnique might not be sensitive enough to detect its\npresence at low concentrations. If generated in the\ntransformer, it would have a higher afﬁnity for the\npaper than for the oil, which would further hinder its\ndetection. Therefore, this molecule was not observed\nduring routine transformer oil analysis.\nThermal ageing studies in oil\nTo further investigate the origin of ethanol, powder\nsamples of cellobiose, glucose and levoglucosan were\naged in oil at 60 and 130 /C176C for 168 h. The results are\nshown in Table 2 as lmol of component per mol of\nstarting material. Both alcohols were generated after\ncellobiose and levoglucosan ageing. However, during\nageing of levoglucosan, the predominant product was\nethanol with a concentration of 40 and 220 times\nhigher than methanol at 60 and 130 /C176C, respectively.\nFurther studies show that the generation of ethanol did\nnot improve with water content, acidic conditions, and\ninert atmosphere (N\n2).\nBased on our ﬁndings, we suspect that ethanol\noriginates at higher cellulose pyrolysis temperatures\nand subsequently is a by-product of levoglucosan\ndegradation, which is conﬁrmed by the high yield of\nethanol during levoglucosan ageing. In a ﬁeld oil\nsample containing a higher ratio of ethanol than\nmethanol (Rodriguez-Celis et al. 2012), the average\nDP\nv was close to 1100, which indicates that the\ncellulosic insulation is still in good shape. However, a\nclose inspection of the transformer paper showed\nblack ‘‘burnt’’ regions, which may not inﬂuence the\noverall DP results but indicates uneven heating of the\npaper. Therefore, ethanol could be a valuable chemical\nmarker for indicating the existence of ‘‘hot spots’’. To\nconﬁrm this hypothesis, alcohol oil testing together\nwith DP\nv post-mortem values from scrapped trans-\nformers will be needed. At this stage, we are not in\nposition to explain the mechanism of ethanol forma-\ntion from cellulose through levoglucosan. Work is in\nprogress to identify the factors and conditions that\ncontribute to its formation.\nConclusions\nThis study involves the generation and identiﬁcation\nof by-products of standard Kraft paper pyrolysis in the\nrange of 250–360 /C176C. It is observed that at pyrolysis\ntemperatures lower than 300 /C176C, there is no apprecia-\nble weight change and the physical appearance of the\npaper is not affected. However, at these temperatures,\nthere is already major polymer degradation since the\nDP\nv values had already decreased and there is a\nsigniﬁcant number of volatile products. As the pyrol-\nysis temperatures increase, the weight loss, physical\nchanges and number and amount of volatiles increase\nas well. Dehydration and depolymerization seem to\noccur simultaneously during pyrolysis. Since these\nTable 2 Comparison of\nchemical markers generated\nfrom cellulosic model\ncompounds\nComponent Ageing (168 h) ( /C176C) lmol/mol of component\nMeOH EtOH 2-FAL\nGlucose 60 \\D.L \\D.L 2\n130 \\D.L \\D.L 484\nCellobiose 60 28 6 4\n130 23 51 22\nLevoglucosan 60 8 321 \\D.L\n130 6 1310 28\n3234 Cellulose (2015) 22:3225–3236\n123\npyrolysis experiments were done at a constant time, it\nis not possible to elaborate on the degradation kinetics\nand build a model to predict the end of life of the\npaper.\nSome of these thermal degradation products were\nobserved during ﬁeld transformer oil analysis, which\ncould become useful in the choice of cellulose thermal\ndegradation markers. Methanol, a marker that is\nalready in use, was observed at all the studied\ntemperatures. However, its yield was not the expected\n1:1 ratio with the concentration of cellulose scissions.\nThis suggests that pyrolysis by itself is not the main\nroute of methanol generation, and its production is\nenhanced under the acidic hydrolytic conditions found\nin accelerated ageing in oil. Ethanol, a molecule that\nwas found together with methanol in ﬁeld samples and\nis generated during the ageing of levoglucosan in oil in\na higher quantity than methanol, was only present at\nhigher pyrolysis temperatures. We suspect ethanol, as\na chemical marker of cellulose degradation, could\nindicate the presence of uneven heating zones in the\ninsulation, also known as hot-spots. Future studies\nwould include various pyrolysis times per temperature\nand the effect of pyrolysis under reagent gases.\nAcknowledgments The authors would like to express their\ngratitude to V.
