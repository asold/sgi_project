Circular, square, and \npolygonal shapes of the planar coils are the important difference regarding transformer topologies. In this work, we have \nchosen the stacked octagonal form of coils. The transformer will be integrated into a converter of type flyback. We have \nopted for the Wheeler method and the S-parameters for determining the geometrical and the electrical parameters. The \nelectrical π model presented summarizes perfectly the various parasitic effects generated by stacked layers of different \nmaterials constituting the transformer. The electromagnetic simulation, by using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3 software, \nillustrates the current density and the distribution of magnetic field lines. We have also used software PSIM 6.0, to validate \nthe equivalent electrical circuit of the transformer in flyback converter.\nKeywords Converter · Planar · Transformer · Octagonal · Integration · RF\n1 Introduction\nPower electronics has never stopped to advance, since \nits appearance. Now, this discipline exists in the major -\nity of electrical systems, ensuring control of energy sup -\nply and the integrity of the components. Passive com-\nponents occupy 80% of electrical circuits’ surface as the \nlow power converter. At present, the integration of active \ncomponents has now become a classical thing; however, \nonly the integration of passive components remains the \nobstacle of miniaturization [1 , 2]. At the heart of isolated \nconverters, there is an essential element, the transformer. \nTo overcome the problem of integration and reducing \nthe size of the transformer, the planar components were \nintroduced [3–5]. The transformer is an inductive compo-\nnent formed by a thin magnetic circuit, usually made of \nferrite, on which conductive coils are deposited. In these \nyears, planar transformers are widely used in monolithic \nintegrated circuits and are implemented in many systems \nfor several applications [6, 7].\n2  Presentation of the microtransformer\nA transformer is an inductive component, it is considered \nas a device whose operation is based on mutual coupling \nbetween at least two inductors. Figure  1 shows a sche -\nmatic diagram of an ideal transformer of two coils.\nIn low frequencies, the behavior of the inductor is mod-\neled by a pure inductance L in series with a resistance Rs, \nwhich characterizes the different losses (Fig.  2a). In high \nfrequencies, the inductance L in series with resistance Rs \nare in parallel with capacitance Cs which characterizes the \ncapacitive coupling between turns (Fig. 2b).\n * Mokhtaria Derkaoui, mderkaoui@inttic.dz | 1LARATIC Laboratory, National Institute of Telecommunications & ICT (INTTIC-Oran), Oran, \nAlgeria. 2LEPA Laboratory, University of Sciences and Technology of Oran (USTO- MB), Oran, Algeria. 3University Center Nour Bachir of El \nBayadh, El Bayadh, Algeria.\nVol:.(1234567890)\nResearch Article SN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:656 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2376-1\nThe behavior of an integrated planar inductor on \nsilicon was proposed in simple ‘‘π’’ model by Nguyen \nand Meyer and then was developed by Ashby and al \n(Fig. 3a). After, Yue and Yong presented a similar model \nwith more appropriate parameters (Fig.  3b) [8, 9]. Later, \nYamaguchi and al proposed the first equivalent circuit \ncomposed of magnetic material placed above or below \nthe inductance (Fig.  3c), but the model became very \ncomplicated [10]; afterward, this work was simplified \nto show the different layers superimposed one on the \nother (Fig.  3d) [11].\nAs a transformer is a coupling between two induc -\ntors, the integrated planar transformer composed of two \nintegrated planar inductors was proposed by [12] (Fig.  4) \nwhich the coils are spiral with square form.\n3  Presentation of octagonal planar \ntransformer\nThe coil’s shape is an important distinction regarding \ninductor and transformer topologies. Circular, square, and \npolygonal spirals have already mentioned to constitute \ntheir coils. In this study, we demonstrate another trans -\nformer model whose coils are of octagonal planar shape \n(Fig. 5).\n3.1  Inductance value’s calculation\nThe calculation’s method developed by Wheeler [13] \nallows the inductance’s evaluation of hexagonal, octago -\nnal or square form of coils, realized in a discrete way. This \nmethod is easy to implement, it has a low error compared \nwith other methods, and it remains valid for reduced \nFig. 1  Schematic diagram of transformer\nFig. 2  Simplified model of inductor: a low frequency and b high \nfrequency\nFig. 3  a Simple π model, b cross section of planar inductor, c ferro -\nmagnetic inductor, d cross section of planar inductor on ferrite\nVol.:(0123456789)\nSN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:656 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2376-1 \n Research Article\nnumber of turns. The inductance L given by Wheeler \nmethod is represented by (expression 1):\n(1)L = k1 ⋅ /u1D7070 ⋅\nn2 ⋅ davg\n1 + k2 ⋅ Am\n,\ndavg is the average diameter, Am is the form factor, n is the \nnumber of turns, and µ0 is the vacuum permeability.\nThe coefficients k1 and k2 depend on the different topol-\nogies of coils (Table 1).\nConferring to the form factor Am, we can obtain the hol-\nlow or full inductors. Thus, a hollow inductor has a higher \ninductance than a full one because the turns located near \nthe center of the spiral contribute to decrease the mutual \npositive inductances and increase the mutual negative \ninductances [13].\n3.2  Feed lines position\nAs stacked topology is chosen in Fig.  5, the relative posi -\ntion between primary and secondary coils is considered in \nterms of the location of their feed lines. The proposition is \nto have the secondary completely rotated by 180-degree \nof the primary (Fig. 6). This configuration tends to weaken \nthe coupling between coils because the feed lines are \nuncovered. The choice between these structures shows \nwhich one has better performance.\n(2)\ndavg = dout + din\n2 ,\n(3)Am = dout − din\ndout + din\n.\nFig. 4  a 3D cross section of an integrated planar transformer with \nsquare form of coils [12] and b equivalent electrical circuit\nFig. 5  Octagonal topology of coils\nTable 1  Values of coefficients \nk1 and k2 used in Wheeler \nmethod\nForm k1 k2\nSquare 2.34 2.75\nHexagonal 2.33 3.82\nOctagonal 2.25 3.55\nVol:.(1234567890)\nResearch Article SN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:656 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2376-1\nThe inductance measurement results for transform-\ners with flipped and non-flipped topologies are shown in \nFig. 7. When the flipped topology is adopted, the curves \nillustrate a significant reduction in the resonant frequency. \nSelf-inductances remain unchanged and magnetic cou-\npling is weakened in low frequency. For frequencies \ngreater than 100 MHz, flipped transformer demonstrates \na lower minimum insertion loss, whereas, the non-flipped \ntransformer presents a proper performance for a wider \nband.\n3.3  Geometrical parameters’ calculation\nThe octagonal planar coils are geometrically described \nby the outer and inner diameters, the number of turns, \nthe width, the thickness, the spacing between turns, and \nthe total length for each coil. We have opted for an outer \ndiameter of 3000 µm and an inner diameter of 2000 µm; \nthe angles are limited to multiples of 45°.\n• Thickness of coil\nThe calculation of thickness depends on skin thickness δ \n(expression 4) which determines the zone where the current \nconcentrates in a conductor (Fig. 8) [14].\nρcu and µ cu are, respectively, resistivity and perme -\nability of copper, f is the operating frequency in high \nfrequencies.\nTo avoid the problem of the skin effect and make the cur-\nrent flowing in the entire conductor, it is necessary to fulfill \nthe following condition:\nThe current density j (x) for x ranging from 0 to t /2 and \nits average value j\navg with J 0 = 109 A/m2 [15], are given by \nexpressions 6 and 7:\nThe electric current i (expression  8) which passes \nthrough the conductor is a function of the current \ndensity and the conductor’s section. This is a function \nof the width w and the thickness t of the planar coil \n(expression  9).\n(4)\n/u1D6FF=\n/uni221A.s2/u1D70CCu\n/u1D70B⋅ /u1D707Cu ⋅ f ,\n(5)t ≤ 2 ⋅ /u1D6FF.\n(6)j(x ) = j0 ⋅ e\n−i\n/parenleft.s2\nx\n/u1D6FF\n/parenright.s2\n⋅ e\n−\n/parenleft.s2\nx\n/u1D6FF\n/parenright.s2\n,\n(7)javg = j0 ⋅\n/bracketleft.s3\ne\n−\n/parenleft.s2\nt\n2⋅/u1D6FF\n/parenright.s2\n+ 1\n/bracketright.s3\n2 .\n(8)i = S c ⋅ javg ,\nFig. 6  Flipped transformer topologies\nFig. 7  Flipped and non-flipped inductances\n Fig. 8  Volume delimited by the skin effect δ in a conductor\nVol.:(0123456789)\nSN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:656 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2376-1 \n Research Article\n• Spacing between turns\n  \n• Total length\n  \n• Width\n  \n4  Modeling of integrated planar octagonal \ntransformer\nIn this work, the planar transformer is composed of two \noctagonal coils in copper, superimposed on a ferromag-\nnetic layer of ferrite (NiZn), and isolated from there by a \ndioxide layer of silicon dioxide  (SiO\n2); all these layers of the \ndifferent materials are superimposed on a layer of silicon \n(Si), which serves as a substrate. This transformer operates \nat a high frequency of the order of 100 MHz (Fig. 9).\nThe magnetic core volume is calculated by \n(expression  13):\nW represents the total magnetic stored energy in the \ntransformer’s coils (expression 14)\nW\nvmax represents maximum volume density of energy \n(expression 15)\nBmax = 0.3T is the maximal saturation induction, and \nμrNiZn = 1400 is the relative permeability of NiZn ferrite.\nTherefore, after calculation, the NiZn magnetic core’s \nvolume equals 0.080 mm 3, which is necessary to store \n3.125 nJ of energy.\nThe core thickness is represented

These allow us to visualize the \ndistribution of the electric potential on the planar trans-\nformer coils and the density of electric current and as well \nas the magnetic field lines. The expressions are as follows:,\n(43)\n∇ ⋅ ⃗H = ⃗J,\n(44)∇ ⋅ ⃗A = ⃗B,\n(45)⃗E = −∇V − j⋅ 𝜔 ⋅ ⃗A,\n(46)⃗J = 𝜎 ⋅ ⃗E + j⋅ 𝜔 ⋅ ⃗D ,\n(45)∇ ⋅ ⃗J = 0,\n(46)⃗B = 𝜇0 𝜇r ⋅ ⃗H,\nFig. 12  Primary and secondary serial resistances versus frequency\nFig. 13  Quality factor of the primary and secondary coils versus fre -\nquency\nVol.:(0123456789)\nSN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:656 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2376-1 \n Research Article\n⃗H : magnetic field (A/m); ⃗B : magnetic flux density (T); ⃗J : \nelectric current density (A/m 2); ⃗E : electric field (V/m); ⃗A : \nmagnetic vector potential (Wb/m); ⃗D : electric displace -\nment field standard (c/m2).\nThe boundary conditions on the study area bounda-\nries are demonstrate by the following expressions:\nthe normal vector at the boundary (expression  51).\nHence\nTo have a good precision, we proceed to an extremely \nfine mesh. Figure  14 illustrates the 3D fine mesh of the \noctagonal integrated transformer for only the two coils \nand for the global structure with the different layers.\nFigure 15 illustrates the electric current density on the \nplanar octagonal coils at 100 MHz, in which we notice \nthat the current is mostly concentrated on the edges of \nthe conductors for high frequency; this effect is due to \nthe skin effect in the rectangular area of conductor.\nFigure 16 illustrates the electric potential distribution on \nplanar coils of the octagonal transformer. The color of the flow \ncurrent represents the magnitude of the electric potential. We \nnotice that this last is maximum at the entry of current and \ndecreases along the coil due to the conductor’s resistance.\nFigure 17 illustrates the distribution of magnetic field lines \nin the octagonal planar transformer composed of copper \ncoils deposited on ferrite NiZn magnetic layer and isolated \nby a dielectric layer, all these layers are deposited on a silicon \nsubstrate. We notice that the magnetic field lines are concen-\ntrated in the transformer and that is due to the ferrite layer.\n6  Simulation of the operating converter\nUsing PSIM software 6.0, we perform in this section three \nsimulations on flyback converter in order to test the \noperation of our integrated transformer. We have cho -\nsen a flyback converter because it is composed of one \ntransformer and few passive components. The principle \nof operation of the flyback is based on the energy trans-\nfer from primary to secondary through a transformer.\n(47)\n⃗D = 𝜀0 ⋅ 𝜀r ⋅ ⃗E,\n(48)⃗n ⋅ ⃗A = 0,\n(49)nx ⋅ Ax + ny ⋅ Ay + nz ⋅ Az = 0,\n(50)⃗n ⋅ ⃗J = 0,\n(51)⃗n = n x ⋅ ⃗i + n y ⋅ ⃗j + n z ⋅ ⃗k .\n(52)nx ⋅ Jx + ny ⋅ Jy + nz ⋅ Jz = 0.\nTo execute the simulations, we need to calculate the \nfollowing parameters:\n• Load resistance\nThe load resistance R  of the flyback converter is given \nby:\n(53)R = V out\niout\n= 5 /u1D6FA.\nFig. 14  3D mesh transformer: a octagonal coils geometry and b \nglobal structure with different layers\nVol:.(1234567890)\nResearch Article SN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:656 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2376-1\nInput voltage: Vin = 12 V; output voltage: Vout = 5 V.\n• Capacitance\nThe capacitance of flyback converter is given by the fol-\nlowing expression for an undulation voltage α of 0.25 V.\n6.1  Simulation of the operating converter \nwith the integrated transformer\nIn this simulation, the circuit of Fig.  18 contains an ideal \ntransformer.\n(54)C = /u1D6FC2 ⋅ m ⋅ Vin\n(1 − /u1D6FC) ⋅ ΔVout ⋅ R ⋅ f = 20 nF.\nThe figure below shows the converter’s output voltage \nand current waveform.\nIn Fig.  19, we notice two modes of the converter: the \ntransient and steady state. The output voltage is 4.9 V \ninstead of 5 V. This is due to voltage drops across the diode \nand transistor. In the steady state, the current is 0.98 A, \nwhich corresponds to an output power of 4.8 W instead \nof 5 W.\nThe following figures show the waveform of the voltage \nand current across both transistor and diode of the flyback \nconverter (Fig. 20).\n6.2  Simulation of the operating converter \nwith the real transformer\nIn this simulation, the circuit of Fig.  21 contains a real \ntransformer.\n• Magnetizing inductance\nThe magnetizing inductance is defined by:\nThe figure below shows the converter’s output voltage \nand current waveform.\nIn Fig. 22, we notice also two modes of the converter: \nthe transient and steady state. The output voltage is 4.25 V \ninstead of 5 V. This is due to voltage drops across the diode \nand transistor, the resistive losses in the conductor, and \nthen the magnetic core losses. In the steady state, the cur-\nrent is 0.85 A, which corresponds to an output power of \n3.6 W instead of 5 W. The following figures show the wave-\nform of the voltage and current across both transistor and \ndiode of the flyback converter (Fig. 23).\n6.3  Simulation of the operating converter \nwith the integrated transformer\nIn this simulation, the circuit of Fig.  24 contains an inte -\ngrated octagonal planar transformer.\nThe figure below shows the converter’s output voltage \nand current waveform.\nIn Fig. 25, we notice again two modes of the converter: \nthe transient and steady state. The output voltage is 4.24 V \ninstead of 5 V. This is due to voltage drops across the diode \nand transistor, the resistive losses in the conductors, and \nthen the magnetic core and the capacitive losses. In the \nsteady state, the current is 0.84 A, which corresponds to \nan output power of 3.6 W instead of 5 W.\n(55)\nLm = n2\np ⋅\n/u1D707NiZn ⋅ d2\nout\n2 ⋅ eNiZn\n= 0.9 mH.\nFig. 15  Current density distribution in the octagonal planar coils at \n100 MHz\nFig. 16  Electrical potential distribution in planar octagonal coils\nVol.:(0123456789)\nSN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:656 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2376-1 \n Research Article\nThe following figures show the waveform of the voltage \nand current across both transistor and diode of the flyback \nconverter (Figs. 26, 27).\nAfter the simulation of the integrated transformer, we \nnotice that the transformer delivers the same power as a \nreal transformer because they give the same results.\n6.4  Flyback converter efficiency\nThe converter efficiency (expression  56) represents its \nperformance.\nwhere\nPj: Joules losses in copper’s conductor; P f: Ferromagnetic \nlosses.\nThe efficiency found is around 82%, so near to the per-\nformance of an operating flyback converter which is 85%.\nWe conclude that this reduction corresponds to the \njoules losses generated by conducting coils and the iron \nlosses in the ferromagnetic core of ferrite.\n7  Conclusion\nThe aim of this work is the geometrical dimensioning \nof the transformer and its electromagnetic modeling to \nintegrate it into a converter. This transformer is destined \nfor the mobile and embedded electronic field requiring \nan energy conversion of low power and a very high fre -\nquency range. The integrated transformer is composed \nalso of a stack of several layers of different materials, \nwhich are two copper coils, magnetic layers of ferrite \nmaterial, insulating layers of dielectric material, and a \nsubstrate of semiconductor material. The geometry of \nthe planar coils constituting the transformer is octagonal \nwith 45° of angles to avoid the concentrated current in \nthe corners. To determine the geometrical parameters, \nwe have opted for the Wheeler method, which presents \n(56)\n/u1D702=\nPout − Pj − Pf\nPout\n,\n(57)Pout = V out ⋅ Iout ,\n(58)Pj = Rseq ⋅ I2\nout ,\n(59)Pf =\nV2\nin\nRseq\n,\nFig. 17  Distribution of magnetic field lines in the transformer: a 3D \ncross section, b above view, c lateral view, and d in front of view\n▸\nVol:.(1234567890)\nResearch Article SN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:656 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2376-1\na low error compared with other methods. After, we have \nused the geometrical parameters to extract the electri-\ncal parameters, which present the parasitic effects in the \ndifferent layers of transformer at the high frequency. In \naddition, we have used a finite elements simulator to \nvisualize the distribution of magnetic field lines, electri-\ncal potential, and current density in the planar octago -\nnal transformer. Besides, we have used another software \nsimulator to validate our results; thus, we have compared \nthe output voltage and current of the flyback in three \ncases of transformer. The waveforms of the converter’s \ncurrents and voltages containing the integrated trans-\nformer were in accordance with those of the literature \nand the measured values were very close to its ideal \ncase.\nFig. 18  Flyback with an ideal transformer\nFig. 19  Output voltage and current of flyback with an ideal trans-\nformer\nFig. 20  Voltage and current of both transistor and diode of the fly -\nback with an ideal transformer\nFig. 21  Flyback with the real transformer\nVol.:(0123456789)\nSN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:656 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2376-1 \n Research Article\nFig. 22  Output voltage and current of flyback with the real trans-\nformer\nFig. 23  Voltage and current of both transistor and diode of the fly -\nback with the real transformer\nFig. 24  Flyback with the integrated transformer\nFig. 25  Output voltage and current of flyback with the integrated \ntransformer\nVol:.(1234567890)\nResearch Article SN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:656 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2376-1\nCompliance with ethical standards \nConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of \ninterest.\nReferences\n 1.
