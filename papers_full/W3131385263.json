Introduction \nThe traditional diagnostic approaches used for fault tolerance are based on mechanism and \nhandcrafted feature extraction [1]. These schemes have complicated feature extraction and feature \nselection mechanisms. In recent years, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm has \nattracted extensive research and attention. CNN has widely been used in various domains like \ncomputer vision [2, 3], image and signal recognition [4] and medical imaging field [5-7]. It \novercomes the defects of traditional neural network algorithm, such as insufficient expression \nability and easy over fitting, and shows strong  capability in feature extraction and feature \nclassification [8]. CNN has attracted wide variety of researchers’ interest in the recent years due \nto its powerful self-learning capabilities and re moval of feature engi neering module. Recent \nbreakthrough has been made in the field of voi ce processing, fault tolerance [9, 10], handwritten \ndigit recognition, etc. Deep learning provided high accuracy rate through its optimization and \nback-propagation algorithm. Various deep belief networks (DBN), stacked autoencoder (SAE) \nand CNN architectures in order to computer network mode parameters. \nElectric power is an indispensable and impo rtant form of energy in the process of \nindustrialization of a country. As one of the key and expensive equipment in power grid system, \nthe safety and reliability of power grid operation have a crucial relationship with it [11]. Among \nthe transformer faults, the winding faults and the abnormal caused by the iron core account for a \nlarge proportion. Scholars at home and abroad have tried to use surface vibration signals to \nmonitor the running state of winding and iron core, and have done a lot of research work. A large \nnumber of experimental analysis and field trial results show that the vibration signal detection \nmethod is effective and suitable for various type s of transformers. The surface vibration of the \ntransformer mainly comes from the internal vibration of the core affected by magnetostriction and \nthe winding vibration caused by electromagnetic force [12]. The cooling system and voltage \nregulating device will also be affected to some extent. It is very important to analyze the operation \n\nANALYSIS ON TRANSFORMER VIBRATION SIGNAL RECOGNITION BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK.  \nYONGHUA CAI, AIXIA HOU \n ISSN PRINT 1392-8716, ISSN ONLINE 2538-8460, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA 485 \nstate of transformer winding and iron core based on vibration signal to find out the problem in \ntime and prolong the service life of transformer. CNN based approaches have shown a great \nimprovement in the field of image recognition [13, 14], speech signal and health monitoring [15]. \nNow the domain has widened in the field of fault diagnosis [16] by combining them with the \ncharacteristics of Transformer rectifier units (TRUs). \nIn this paper, a transformer with rated voltage of (230±8x1.25 %) /121/11kV is identified and \nanalyzed for its vibration. An approach combining the wavelet transform and convolutional neural \nnetwork is proposed to extract the characteristics of the vibration signal on the transformer surface. \nThe main contribution of this work is effective identification of vibration signal while utilizing \nthe combination of both wavelet transform an d CNN based technique. The outcomes for the \nproposed methodology utilizing convolution neural  networks in different station transformer \nsurface vibration signal classification is advantageous, as the integration of feature extraction and \nclassification recognition can effectively classify vibration signal. This combination provides a \nfeasible classification and identification solution for providing better efficiency and accuracy.  \nThe rest of this article is arranged as: Sectio n 2 presenting the literature review of existing \ntechniques in this field; principle analysis is discussed in Section 3 providing the details of \nconvolutional neural network, wavelet transform and different vibration tests. Section 4 detailing \nthe experimental results and analysis part followed by Section 5 providing the conclusion and \nfuture scope of this work.  \n2. Literature review \nDue to the importance of vibration signal detection, scholars at home and abroad have done a \nlot of research on vibration monitoring. For exampl e, in optical fiber warning system, it is very \nimportant to identify different types of optical fiber vibration signals. The recognition of fiber \nvibration signal by neural network is one of the common methods in this field. As a well-trained \nsmall network, the random config uration network can get good results in the identification of \noptical fiber vibration signals. However, in the case of limited number of vibration signals, the \nrecognition rate of SCNs is also limited. In or der to improve the recognition rate of vibration \nsignals, Qu, H. et al. proposed adaboost-SCN algorithm. It integrates different SCNS as the basic \nclassifier in AdaBoost. The ad aboost-SCN experiment shows that the test accuracy of the \nalgorithm is 12.1 % higher than that of the original one. The proposed algorithm not only increases \nthe recognition rate of fiber vibration signals, bu t also improves the generalization ability of the \noriginal SU prachiasmatic nucleus with a limite d number of vibration signal samples [17].  \nBagheri M. et al. discussed in detail the analytical method of transformer vibration modeling. \nHowever, due to the mixing of the higher harmonics and the basic harmonics in the vibration \nspectrum, it is not practical to interpret the transformer vibration signals accurately with analytical \nmodels. Using advanced machine learning and signal processing technology, a predictive model \nof transformer operation based on vibration signal is developed. The insulation deterioration and \nshort circuit analysis between turns of transformer are simulated and tested. At the same time, the \nover-excitation and under-excitation of the transformer are also studied and evaluated. The \nestablished prediction model can detect the transf ormer short circuit fault in the early stage by \nusing vibration signal before the transformer sudden failure. Real-time information is transmitted \nto the cloud system and the results can be accessed from any portable device [18]. Chen G. et al. \nproposed a calculation method related to wavelet packet transformation. In order to verify the \nfeasibility of the main frequency section and th e proposed method for calculating the blasting \nfrequency characteristics, the field blasting vibration signals monitored in a mine are used as an \nexample. The influence of explosive charge amount and distance on the main frequency band \ndistribution is also studied. The results show that the main frequency segment based on this \nmethod is a sensitive, accurate and efficient freq uency parameter. It can describe the frequency \ncharacteristic of explosive signal and overcome the shortcoming of Fourier transform. When the \ncharge amount of explosive is constant, the sp an of main frequency decreases as the distance \nANALYSIS ON TRANSFORMER VIBRATION SIGNAL RECOGNITION BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK.  \nYONGHUA CAI, AIXIA HOU \n486 JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING. MARCH 2021, VOLUME 23, ISSUE 2  \nincreases, and the energy in frequency domain of explosive vibration signal is mainly concentrated \nin the low frequency range. When the distance is constant, the peak energy of explosive vibration \nsignal increases with the increase of explosive charge, but the main frequency band does not \nchange obviously [19]. In order to avoid the influence of interference on the frequency \ncharacteristic, the least square method is used to eliminate the trend component of the signal, and \nthe wavelet threshold method with the function of hard threshold and birge-Massart strategy are \nused for denoising. The CNN based approaches are best suitable for automatic feature extraction \nfrom the raw signal [20-26]. The fault diagnosis approaches using CNN based methods are divided \ninto two dimensions (1D and 2D) depending upon the input signal dimensions. Wen, et al. [20]; \nHoang, et al. [21], Wang, et al. [22] and Ding, et al. [23] have utilized the 2D input raw time-series \nsignal into a 2D time frequency image sequence and then built their respective CNN models as \nper the designated diagnosis task. Liu, et al. [24] and Zhang, et al. [25, 26] dealt with the \nnon-stationary environments of electric machines and bearings by proposing a CNN based \napproach with the disrupted time-series signal.  A semi-supervised multi-scale CNN based fault \nidentification approach was proposed by Pan, et al. [27] utilizing unlabeled samples. They utilized \na transfer learning approach wh ich initially trains the network on the base dataset and finally \ntransfers the learned features to  the target network. Another tr ansferable deep CNN model was \nproposed by Yosinski, et al. [28] along with specialized different layers which transfers the \nfeatures from the distant tasks outperforming the weight randomization. GoogleNet Inception-V3 \nplatform was utilized by Esteva, et al. [29] for the classification of skin lesions. This network was \ninitially pre-trained over ImageNet dataset and then transferred to a clinical image platform using \ntransfer learning. Bhardwaj, et al. [30] used  a novel Quadrant based Inception-V3 network \narchitecture for Diabetic retinopathy severity grading to improve the diagnostic capability for \nmass screening. They improved the grading effi ciency by utilizing data augmentation, image \nenhancement and optical disc removal pipelines.  \nVarious image recognition studies have used tr ansfer learning-based  approaches utilizing \nCNNs trained over ImageNet dataset. These resulted into much better outcomes in terms of \nefficiency than the models trained only on a small respective target dataset. All these works reveal \nthat CNN provides better performance without utilizing feature engineering and extensive domain \nknowledge. \n3. Principle analysis \n3.1. Introduction of convolutional neural network \nAs shown in Fig. 1, the existing convolutional neural network structure includes the input  \nlayer, the intermediate hidden layer and the outp ut layer. The intermediate hidden layer is \ncomposed of one or more convolutional layers and sampling layers. In the basic structure of a \nconvolutional neural network, the components that are mainly used to extract features are the \nconvolutional layer, sampling layer and fully connected layer. \n \nFig. 1. Structure diagram of convolutional neural network \nConvolutional Layer: The convolutional layer is mainly used for feature extraction, which is \nto extract local features of each neuron and then serve as the output neuron of the layer. It is mainly \n\nANALYSIS ON TRANSFORMER VIBRATION SIGNAL RECOGNITION BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK.  \nYONGHUA CAI, AIXIA HOU \n ISSN PRINT 1392-8716, ISSN ONLINE 2538-8460, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA 487 \nthrough the sparse connection of neurons at the input layer and network weights, and then \ntwo-dimensional convolution, the local features of neurons can be obtained, and the relationship \nbetween other features can be determined based on this feature information.  \nSampling Layer: This layer is used in the Convolutional Neural Network for intermediate \nsampling of output features provided by the conv olutional layer. Feature information, which is \nobtained by convolution layer to feature mapping requires by sampling, the convolution output \nlayer neurons as sampling the input layer, similar to the process of convolution layer, layer of \nsample has multiple features in the process of mapping, in the sample layer each feature mapping \nplane all the neurons have the same weight, sampling for the input image in convolution layer in \nconvolution summation, and bias, after a sigmoid function which is to get the output of the sample \nlayer [31]. In feature mapping, the excitation function Sigmoid with small kernel of influence \nfunction is used to obtain the mapping feature with constant displacement. In the sampling layer, \nall neurons in the plane of each feature map have the same weight, thus reducing the computational \ncomplexity of the network. The structure with sampling layer is connected behind the \nconvolutional layer, which can make the feature mapping extracted by the convolutional layer \nmore concentrated. \nFully Connected Layer: This acts as a traditional neural network that extracts the feature vector \nfrom the adjacent subsampling layers and provide the output probabilities to the final output layer \nof the network. The output probabilities are obtained using the softmax activation function at the \noutput layer that yields the probability values ranging from 0 to 1 indicating the categorical output \nclasses. \nIn this work, the input provided to the convolutional neural network contain 3600 images \nextracted by the time-frequency transform method of wavelet transform. The output of the \nconvolutional network provides the vibration fau lt analysis into three different fault classes \nnamely; the inner race (IR) fault, the outer race (OR) fault and the rolling bearing (BA) faults. The \nanalysis was done on the vibration signal under different motor loads and fault diameters to yield \nthree-class classification using the CNN network into IR faults, BA faults and OR faults.  \n3.2. Wavelet transform \nWavelet transform solves the contradiction in time-frequency domain very well. It is not only \na local transform in time, but also a local transform in frequency domain. Wavelet transform can \nbe used to make a more detailed analysis of the frequency of function or signal by means of \nexpansion, translation and other operational functions, and solve many difficult problems that \ncannot be solved by Fourier transform to a great  extent. The wavelet transform is formed by \nscaling and shifting the parent wavelet function. A signal 𝑥ሺ𝑡ሻ is a signal with limited energy, \nwhich satisfies: \n𝑥ሺ𝑡ሻ ∈𝐿\nଶሺ𝑅ሻ ⟺න |𝑥ሺ𝑡ሻ|ଶ𝑑𝑡 <+ ∞\n \nோ\n. (1)\nIts wavelet transform is defined as the inte gral transform with the function cluster Ψ௔,ఛ(𝑡) as \nthe integral kernel, as follows: \n𝑊𝑇௫(𝑎, 𝜏) = 1\n√𝑎න𝑥 (𝑡)Ψ௔,ఛ(𝑡)𝑑𝑡\nାஶ\nିஶ\n. (2)\nFunction cluster Ψ௔,ఛ(𝑡) is the wavelet function cluster ge nerated by basic wavelet function \nΨ(𝑡) through expansion and translation: \nANALYSIS ON TRANSFORMER VIBRATION SIGNAL RECOGNITION BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK.  \nYONGHUA CAI, AIXIA HOU \n488 JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING. MARCH 2021, VOLUME 23, ISSUE 2  \nΨ௔,ఛ(𝑡) = 1\n√𝑎Ψ൬𝑡−𝜏\n𝑎 ൰,      (𝑎 >0 ,    𝜏∈𝑅 ), (3)\nwhere, 𝐴 is the scale parameter, 𝜏 is the time shift parameter, and 1/√𝑎 is the normalized constant \nto ensure the energy conservation of the transformation, namely: \nฮΨ௔,ఛ(𝑡)ฮ\nଶ\n= නห Ψ௔,ఛ(𝑡)ห\nଶାஶ\nିஶ\n𝑑𝑡 = නห Ψ௔,ఛ(𝑡)ห𝑑𝑡\nାஶ\nିஶ\n. (4)\nIt can be seen from the above formula that th e wavelet transform is A linear transformation, \nwhich USES the oscillation function Ψ௔,ఛ(𝑡) as the window to scan and shift the signal 𝑋(𝑡) by \nchanging the frequency, where the expansion parameter used to change the oscillation frequency \nis a and the translation parameter is 𝜏. Unlike THE STFT, the wavelet transform can change the \nresolution in time domain and frequency domain by adjusting the frequency. In high frequency \nband, wavelet transform can achieve good time domain resolution, but the frequency domain \nresolution is poor, in low frequency band, the situation is just the opposite. \n3.3. Test objects \nIn order to conduct the research on transforme r vibration identification, a transformer model \nsfSZ10-180,000 /220 is selected as the resear ch object. The specific parameters are shown in \nTable 1. \nTable 1. Parameters of SFSZ10-180,000 /220 transformer \nType of transformer SFSZ10-180000/220 \nRated capacity / kV A 180000/180000/60000 \nRated voltage / kV (230±8×1.25%)/121/11 \nHigh voltage rated current / A 541.8 \nLow voltage side rated current / A 3149 \nTotal weight / t 206.4 \nFrequency / Hz 50 \n3.4. Vibration test \nIn the process of acquisition, the acceleration sensor of six m odels for ULT2008 separately \nadsorbed on the surface of the test transformer tank is utilized. The high side and low voltage side, \nthe location of the points is shown in Fig. 2. Among them, 1, 2, 3 points located on the high side, \n4, 5, 6 point located in the low voltage side. At the same time, the model for ULT2061 adsorption \nthree-dimensional vibration acceleration sensor is used in the test transformer. A phase (point 1) \nlevel of 10 cm is used to the right direction; where 𝑋 direction is the horizontal direction, 𝑌 \ndirection is the vertical direction and the 𝑍 direction represents the direction perpendicular to the \nsurface of the transformer. \nIn Fig. 2; A, B, C indicates the three-dimensional points at the high voltage side and a, b, c \nindicates the three-dimensional points at the lo w voltage side. The surface vibration signal of \ntransformer contains abundant state information,  and whether the measured signal collected is \ncomplete and effective has an important influence on the feature extraction of vibration signal and \nthe status evaluation of transformer. The image of a real-life transformer is depicted in Fig. 3. \nThe real-life transformer is completely differ ent and complex comparative to its schematic \ndiagram. Due to the complex tran sformer structure and the influe nce of transmission path and \nother factors, the unreasonable setting of samplin g frequency and sampling length in the signal \nacquisition process is likely to lead to the large difference in vibration signal characteristics. This \ncondition collected by the same transformer seri ously affects the analysis and judgment of \nANALYSIS ON TRANSFORMER VIBRATION SIGNAL RECOGNITION BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK.  \nYONGHUA CAI, AIXIA HOU \n ISSN PRINT 1392-8716, ISSN ONLINE 2538-8460, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA 489 \ntransformer operating state [32, 33]. Therefore, in the process of collecting the transformer surface \nvibration data, the following parameters are mainly set: \nSampling frequency, FS: Setting a reasonable sampling frequency can effectively avoid signal \ndistortion. Relevant studies have shown that the transformer vibration signal is mainly within \n1 kHz. According to the sampling theorem, the sampling frequency should be no less than 2 kHz. \nSampling interval, 𝑇: It refers to a length t (sampling length) sampling of the transformer at a \ncertain time interval. The setting of this parameter should be in the same period of time with the \noperating condition data of the transformer, such as operating voltage, load current and oil tank, \nso as to facilitate the analysis of data of diffe rent working conditions. It is found through field \ninvestigation that the transformer substation records the operating condition data every 5 minutes \nwhen monitoring the transformer, so it is recommended to set this parameter to 5 minutes. \nSampling time, 𝑇: It refers to the time required to complete 𝑓 =1 /𝑇, sampling, which is \nrelated to frequency to some extent. The smaller the sampling length is, the smaller the frequency \ninterval will be, and the higher the frequency resolution will be, namely, 𝑓 =1 /𝑇. Therefore, this \nparameter can be set according to the minimum frequency to be studied when analyzing the \nvibration signal. \nTo sum up, according to the actual requirements of transformer vibration signal analysis in this \npaper, relevant parameters of data acquisition are set as follows: sampling frequency 10 kHz, \nsampling duration 1 s, and sampling interval 5 min. \n \na) High voltage side \n \nb) Low voltage side \nFig. 2.

Sample data \nThe samples used in this paper were divided in to a section every 0.05 s of the data of each \nmeasurement point, and 3600 sections were taken for wavelet transform analysis of each section \nof data to obtain the time-frequency diagram of the vibration signal of this section. The training \nsamples were set as training samples, so the training samples were divided into 9 groups with \n3600 samples in each group and a total of 32,400 samples in the training sample set [34, 35]. 400 \nsegments of data are taken after a period of time, and wavelet transform is performed to obtain \ntime-frequency graph, which is set as the test sample. Similarly, the test samples were divided into \n9 groups of 400 for a total of 3,600.

The images extracted by the \ntime-frequency transform method of wavelet transform can effectively represent the localization \ncharacteristics of the original signal frequency and contain rich state information. The information \ndepicted by the time-frequency diagram shows that the amplitude of the signal is larger in case of \nfaulty condition than in the normal condition. The color variation in the wavelet transform output \ndepicts the magnitude of the time-frequency grid coefficients. The wavelet transforms outputs \ncarry very important information regarding the faulty condition as the high energy peaks indicated \nin the wavelet transform outputs at the low frequency bands provides the information about the \nbearing that is heading to the defect or faulty  condition. These images are provided to the CNN \nnetwork for classification of vibration faults into three types; IR faults, BA faults and OR faults.  \n\nANALYSIS ON TRANSFORMER VIBRATION SIGNAL RECOGNITION BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK.  \nYONGHUA CAI, AIXIA HOU \n ISSN PRINT 1392-8716, ISSN ONLINE 2538-8460, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA 491 \n4.2.

Since there \nare 32,400 samples, 507 batches shall be processed after all the samples are processed.

Conclusions \nIn this paper, the vibration analysis was perf ormed for a transformer with rated voltage of \n(230±8x1.25%) /121/11kV. A method based on convolutional neural network is proposed which \ncombines the wavelet transform to extract the characteristics of the transformer surface vibration \nsignal. The main conclusions achieved from the study are as follows: \n1) The robust combination of wavelet transforms and convolutional neural network has great \nadvantages in the classification and identification of vibration signals at different measuring points \non the transformer surface. The integration of f eature extraction, classification and identification \nmakes the vibration signal recognition and classification process effective. \n2) This method is feasible for classification and identification with its recognition rate related \nto the model structure and parameters of the network.  \n3) The proposed method is a reliable vibration identification and classification method that \nprovides an accuracy value of 92.74 %. \n4) The future part of this research will focus on more generalized network model and \nparameters experimentation will be conducted on each parameter to further investigate the \naccuracy and efficiency of this method. \nReferences \n[1] Yan J., Zhu H., Yang X., Cao Y., Shao L.
