This study also provides information on\nthe possible health hazards likely to arise from repeated\nexposure over a relatively limited period of time (USEPA,\n2000; OECD, 1995). Though these guidelines provide all\nthe information required for the conduct of the study, no\ninformation is provided on the appropriate statistical tools\nto be used to analyze the data obtained from the study. Use\nof right statistical tool to analyze the data obtained from\ntheses studies is very crucial as the interpretation of the\ndata is mostly based on the results of the statistical analy-\nsis.\nThe statistical tools used to analyze the data obtained\nfrom 122 numbers of twenty-e ight-day repeated dose oral\ntoxicity tests in rats were examined in the present study.\nThe objective of the study was to know the different statis-\ntical tools that are used in these studies and the possible\nimpact of these statistical tools on interpretation of the\ndata. A brief discussion on the use and the property of the\ndifferent statistical tools used in the studies are also given.\nThe purpose of this article wished for the standardization\nof statistics and the analysis methods. Finally, the authors\nmade an attempt to suggest statistical techniques that may\nbest suit twenty-eight-day rep eated dose oral toxicity stud-\nies in rodents.\nCorrespondence: Katsumi Kobayashi (E-mail: kobayashi-katsumi@nite.go.jp)\nOriginal Article\n98\nK. Kobayashi et al.\nV ol. 33 No. 1\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudies examined\nA total number of 122 studies conducted in various test\nfacilities in Japan were examined (MHLW, 2006). The\nchemical of these examinations was executed with existing\nchemical substances by the guideline of the Chemical Sub-\nstance Control Law (1986). The number of studies con-\nducted in each test facility is given in parenthesis: Food\nand Drug Safety Center, Kanagawa (22), An-Pyo Center,\nShizuoka (22), Mitsubishi Chemical Safety Institute Ltd.,\nIbaraki (18), Safety Research Institute for Chemical Com-\npounds Co., LTD, Hokkaido (15), Bozo Research Center\nInc., Shizuoka (12), Research Institute for Animal Science\nin Biochemistry & Toxicology, Kanagawa (11), Panap-\nharm Laboratories, Kumamoto (10), Nihon Bioresearch\nInc., Gifu (9) and National Institutes of Health, Tokyo (3).\nQuantitative and qualitative items\nSeveral quantitative and qualitative items are evaluated\nin twenty-eight-day repeated dose oral toxicity tests in\nrats, as per the regulatory guidelines. The quantitative\nitems that require statistical analysis are body weight, food\nconsumption, water consumption, leucocytes, erythro-\ncytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, mean corpuscu-\nlar volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpus-\ncular hemoglobin concentration, differential leucocyte\ncounts, prothrombin time, activated partial throm boplastin\ntime, total protein, albumin, albumin/globulin ratio, total\nbilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotrans-\nferase, γ-glutamic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase,\nacetylcholinesterase, total cholesterol, tryglycerides, phos-\npholipids, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, inor-\nganic phosphorous, calcium, sodium, potassium, chlo-\nrides, urine volume, specific gravity of urine, absolute\norgan weights and relative organ weights. Qualitative\nitems that require statistical analysis are mortality, func-\ntional observation battery, clinical signs, urinalysis (color,\npH, protein, glucose, ketone bodies, bilirubin, occult\nblood, urobilinogen, epithelial cells, erythrocytes, leuco-\ncytes, casts and crystals) and pathological findings (mac-\nroscopic and microscopic). But the regulatory guidelines\ndo not indicate the specific statistical techniques to be used\nto analyze these data.\nWhich test to be used - One-sided or two-sided?\nWhen the t-test and Dunnett’s multiple comparison test\n(Dunnett’s test) are used, the significant difference detec-\ntion rate of a two-sided test is about 85% as compared with\na one-sided test (Kobayashi, 1997a). In toxicological stud-\nies, usually a dosed group is compared with the control\ngroup. For this comparison, one-sided test is ideal, hence\nY oshimura and Ohashi (1992) recommend the one-sided\ntest for comparing a dosed group with the control group.\nIs analysis of variance (ANOVA) necessary?\nIt is a common practice to subject the data, if they are\nfrom more than two groups, ANO VA. If ANO VA shows a\nsignificant difference among the groups, multiple compar-\nison tests are used to find the significant difference\nbetween any two groups. In recent years, several authors\nsuggested that the error of the second kind can be pre-\nvented by carrying out direct multiple comparison tests,\nwithout subjecting the data to ANOV A (Hamada et al .,\n1998; Kobayashi et al., 2000a; Sakaki et al., 2000). It may\nbe worth mention in this context that Dunnett (1964) did\nnot recommend ANOV A prior to multiple comparison\ntests.\nIs Bartlett’s homogeneity test necessary?\nGenerally Bartlett’s test is used to examine the homoge-\nneity of variance if the number of anim als in a group is 10\nor more. Therefore, this test is not used in the toxicity stud-\nies with dogs, where the number of animals in the group is\nless. According to Kobayashi et al. (1998), Bartlett’s test is\nnot required to examine the homogeneity of variance,\nwhen the number of animals in a group is less.\nNon-parametric type Dunnett’s test\nThe non-parametric Dunnett’s multiple comparison test\nhas two techniques - ‘joint type’ and ‘separate type’ or\nSteel’s test. When the Steel’s test shows the highest dosage\ncorrelation, the number of animals required in the dosage\ngroups to detect a significant difference in the low dosage\ngroup is four (Inaba, 1994; Kobayashi et al., 1995). On the\ncontrary, ‘joint type’ needs 15 animals in each group.\nTransformation of data\nIf the data show heterogeneity of variance as per\nBartlett’s test, sometimes the data are transformed, for\nexample to logarithmic values and then they are subjected\nto non-parametric tests. According to Finney (1995),\n“when a scientist measures a quantity such as concentra-\ntion of a chemical compound in body fluid, his interest\nusually lies in the scale, perhaps mg/ml, that he has used;\nhe is less likely to be interested in a summary of results\nrelating to a transformed quantity such as the logarithm of\nblood concentration. If he analyzes in terms of logarithms,\nencouraged perhaps by an  elementary but uncritical statis-\ntical textbook or by a convenient software package, he may\nfind significant differences but to express his conclusions\nin meaningful numbers may be impossible. I do not assert\nStatistical tools used in short-term toxicity studies.\n99\nV ol. 33 No. 1\nthat a scientist should never transform data before analy-\nsis; I urge that data should be transformed only after care-\nful consideration of all consequence”. Th erefore, transfor-\nmation should be done cautiously.\nPower of Scheffe’s test\nUse of Scheffé’s test is discouraged in recent years\nbecause this test may not show a significant difference in\nthe dosage groups even if the dosage groups show a differ-\nence of 60-53% compared to control group (Kobayashi et\nal., 1997b).\nPower of non-parametric tests using ranked data\nIn four groups setting with the highest dosage correla-\ntion, the minimum numbers of animals required in the low-\ndose group to detect a significant difference, compared to\ncontrol, using the statistical tools of Scheffé’s type, Dunn’s\ntest, Tukey type, Dunnett ty pe, Williams-Wilcoxon test,\nSteel test and Mann-Whitney’s U test are 22, 19, 18, 15, 8,\n4 and 3, respectively. Therefore, in the twenty-eight-day\nrepeated dose oral toxicity tests in rats, where the number\nof animals is 5/sex/group, except Steel and Mann-\nWhitney’s U tests, other tests are not used. Inaba (1994)\nmade a similar observation on the power of the above tests.\nPower of Chi-square and Fisher’s tests\nWhen a finding in the animals of a control group is 0, in\norder to find a significant difference of the finding between\nthe control group (n=5) and dosage group (n=5) by chi-\nsquare test, all the 5 animals in the dosage group (n=5)\nshould show the finding, whereas by Fisher’s test 4 ani-\nmals should show the finding. When 1 animal in the con-\ntrol group shows a finding, even if the finding is seen in all\nthe animals in the dosage group, a significant difference is\nnot detected by chi-square test, but it is detected by\nFisher’s test. In the light of the above it may be stated that\npower of one-sided Fisher’s test is better than the Chi-\nsquare test.\nDunnett’s test is the expanded version of t-tests\nDunnett’s test becomes t-test when two groups are ana-\nlyzed (Kobayashi et al., 1997c). Therefore, when compar-\ning the recovery groups in the twenty-eight-day repeated\ndose oral toxicity tests in rats, where number of the groups\nis 2, it does not make any difference, whether the analysis\nis carried out by Dunnett test or t-test.\nPower of Mann-Whitney’s U test\nThis test is generally used for the analysis of pathology\ndata (Kobayashi et al., 1997d). A significant difference by\na one-sided test is detected if the calculated U value is four\nor less. Since one-side is expected in studies like twenty-\neight-day repeated dose oral toxicity tests in rats, a one-\nsided Mann-Whitney’s U test is used to analyze pathology\ndata obtained from these studies.\nRESULTS\nQuantitative data\nOut of 122 studies examined, 79 studies used statistical\ntools that follow a complicated course (tool numbers; 2, 3,\n4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16 and17) and 43 studies used statis-\ntical tools that follow simple course (tool numbers; 1, 6, 7,\n11, 13 and14) (Table 1; Fig. 1). The statistical tools\ndescribing the method of analyzes, in the case of three or\nmore groups and two groups were mentioned in 6 studies,\nwhereas this description was not found in 11 studies. Only\neight studies used trend test (Jonckheere, 1954). In the tool\nnumber 10, the significance level of ANOV A and Kruskal-\nWalis’s H test were set at p=0.10. For comparing with the\ncontrol, this tool set the significance level of p=0.05. Tool\nnumbers 13 and 14 did not perform Bartlett’s test for test-\ning the homogeneity of variance. Use of one-sided or two-\nsided test is not indicated in 87 studies. Only one study\nindicated use of non-pa rametric test.\nQualitative data\nSince urinalysis data were classified into many grades,\nchi-square test was used to analyze these data in most of\nthe studies. For macro- and microscopic pathological find-\nings, Mann-Whitney’s U test, Fisher’s test and Chi-square\ntest were used. Most of the studies did not indicate the\nalpha. Only the pathological findings of 3 studies were\nexamined for dose-relationship (Table 2).\nUse of a one-sided test was more common t han a two-\nsided test in the case of analysis of both quantitative and\nqualitative data (Table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nNational Toxicology Program, USA published techni-\ncal reports of long-term carcinogenicity studies and short-\nterm toxicity tests carried out with more than 500 sub-\nstances in rat and mouse (NIH, 2006). Most of these stud-\nies used the statistical tools almost similar to the ones cur-\nrently used to analyze the data obtained from the toxicity\ntests of agricultural chemicals and medical drugs\n(Kobayashi et al., 2000b). \nOn examination of 122 studies, it was found that com-\nplex and easy courses of analytical techniques were used\nfor the analysis of the quantitative data. These tools may\nbe classified into 4 different categories. Five tools (tool\n100\nK. Kobayashi et al.\nV ol. 33 No. 1\nnumbers; 4, 5, 8, 16 and17) are the advanced type of the\nalgorithm, similar to the one developed by Y amazaki et al.\n(1981). These tools include Scheffé’s test, non-parametric\ntype Dunnett’s and Scheffé’s tests with very low power.\nSix tools (tool numbers; 3, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 15) are again\nadvanced type of algorithm developed by Sano and\nOkayama (1990), which can be used even if the number of\nanimals in the groups are different. Use of the non-para-\nmetric Dunnett type test with low power is also seen in few\nstudies. Mann-Whitney’s U test was also used (tool num-\nber; 9) in 14 studies in order to retain the power. Three\ntools (tool numbers; 2, 6 and 11) are an improved version\nof non-parametric type Dunnett’s test (‘joint type’) and\nSteel’s test (‘separate type’). Dunnett’s or Scheffé’s tests is\nindependently used for 3 tools (tool numbers; 1, 13 and\n14). Though use of Scheffé’s test has the advantage of\ncomparison of groups in various combinations, for exam-\nple, control+mid dose vs.high dose, low dose+mid dose vs.\nhigh dose, etc., it has extremely low detection power.\nHence, this test is not widely used in recent years.\nY oshimura (1987) used Bartlett’s test to analyze the dif-\nference in distribution of variance among the groups,\nwhere number of animals in the group is more than 10. The\npower of Bartlett’s test decreases when the number of ani-\nmals in the group is less.\nDunnett’s test is the expanded version of t-tests, hence,\nit becomes t-test when two groups are analyzed by\nDunnett’s test. Therefore, for the comparison of two\ngroups either Dunnett test or t-test can be used.\nThe most important purpose of applying statistical anal-\nysis in toxicity studies is to know whether the items esti-\nmated in the experimental group has increased or\ndecreased compared to the control. Therefore, a one-sided\ntest is used. Detection rate of two-sided test is half of the\none-sided test, hence it is important to mention in the study\nreport whether a one-sided or two-sided test is used. It may\nTable 1.\nClassification of number of studies based on the statistical tools used for the analysis of quan titative data.\nNumber of studiesDescription of statistical toolsTool.

Continued.\nStatistical tools used in short-term toxicity studies.\n103\nV ol. 33 No. 1\nbe noted that use of ANOV A causes the error of the second\nkind. Because of this, some of the recent studies skipped\nANOV A in the decision tree and straight away used the\nstatistical tools for post hoc  comparison (Sumida et al .,\n2006; Nagano et al., 2006).\nFor the analysis of qualitative data, chi-square and\nFisher’s tests do not seem to be appropriate, though\nFisher’s test is slightly more sensitive than the chi-square\ntest. These two tests do not detect a significant difference\nbetween a finding in the dosage group and control group,\nwhen all the animals (5/5) show the finding in the dosage\ngroup and 2 animals in the control group (2/5). On the\nother hand, Mann-Whitney’s U test, which converts the\nscores into numerical values, detects a significant differ-\nence, when the finding in the dosage group is 5/5 and con-\ntrol group is 2/5. Therefore, Mann-Whitney’s U test has\nbetter sensitivity to analyze qualitative data than the chi-\nsquare and Fisher’s tests. Trend test like Jonckheere test\ncan be used to determine no observed adverse effect level/\nno observed effect level (NOAEL/NOAL) in the twenty-\neight-day repeated dose oral toxicity tests. The statistical\ntools used, especially in the case of non-parametric tests,\nto determine the NOAEL/NOAL may be clearly elabo-\nrated in the study report.\nWe propose Dunnett’s test for the analysis of quantita-\ntive data obtained from twenty-eight-day repeated dose\noral toxicity tests in rode nts and for qualitative data,\nMann-Whitney’s U test. For both tests, one-sided test with\np=0.05 may be applied.\nTable 2.\nA classification of number of studies based on the statistical tools used for the analysis of q ualitative data.\nTable 3.
