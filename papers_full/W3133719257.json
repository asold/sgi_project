  "abstract": "Deep learning has demonstrated its strengths in numerous binary analysis\\ntasks, including function boundary detection, binary code search, function\\nprototype inference, value set analysis, etc. When applying deep learning to\\nbinary analysis tasks, we need to decide what input should be fed into the\\nneural network model. More specifically, we need to answer how to represent an\\ninstruction in a fixed-length vector. The idea of automatically learning\\ninstruction representations is intriguing, however the existing schemes fail to\\ncapture the unique characteristics of disassembly. These schemes ignore the\\ncomplex intra-instruction structures and mainly rely on control flow in which\\nthe contextual information is noisy and can be influenced by compiler\\noptimizations.\\n In this paper, we propose to pre-train an assembly language model called\\nPalmTree for generating general-purpose instruction embeddings by conducting\\nself-supervised training on large-scale unlabeled binary corpora. PalmTree\\nutilizes three pre-training tasks to capture various characteristics of\\nassembly language. These training tasks overcome the problems in existing\\nschemes, thus can help to generate high-quality representations. We conduct\\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, and compare PalmTree with other\\ninstruction embedding schemes. PalmTree has the best performance for intrinsic\\nmetrics, and outperforms the other instruction embedding schemes for all\\ndownstream tasks.\\n",
