  "abstract": "A Chatbot is an artificial intelligence-based software system that imitates human communication with Artificial Intelligence. It is formulated to be the eventual personal assistant for amusement, assisting with tasks like respond to queries, obtaining driving instructions, augmenting the sensors in a smart house and playing preferred music among others. Chatbots are becoming increasingly common among companies due to their ability to minimize consumer care costs and manage various users at once. However, to perform these many tasks we need the chatbot to be as efficient as possible. To provide a solution to this, we develop Chatbot incorporated with Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). AIML is utilized to response for standard and common queries namely, such welcoming and greetings. Although LSA can be used to answer at any time for service-related questions, ensuring user satisfaction. Any college (or) academy may utilize this chatbot to answer the questions. Due to the advent of deep learning technology, this study provides research opportunity in Chatbots.",
