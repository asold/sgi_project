    "abstract": "Gearing studies, gear-manufacturing simulations or FEM analysis are nowadays performed mostly in virtual environment. Basically, studies in virtual environment require models, in present cases gear models. The reliability of the results of further studies requires gear models that are built with an adequate precision, and in a shortest possible time too. A shorter modeling time allows numerous rebuilds caused by different parameter changes, profile displacements, tool profile changes or even manufacturing error simulations. Our final goal is to develop a new, simplified gear model generating method, based on the relative movements of the tool(s) and work piece. The generating procedure proposed in the present paper makes possible instantaneous modification of the cutting tool or manufacturing motions without of the use of complicated mathematical formulae – still ensuring a satisfying precision. This pure Computer Aided Design method is intended to work much faster than other usually used gear modeling methods, with a sufficient precision which can be used for any intended further technical or scientific purpose. The authors have developed a points cloud generating and filtering method based on Alpha Shape filtering algorithm. The generating algorithm was completed with arbitrary chosen feed type motions. The initial algorithm was optimized for a faster generating time, with the keeping of the imposed precision. The developed method was used to generate the asymmetrical tooth structure of a helical teethed cylindrical gear.",
