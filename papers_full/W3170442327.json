    "abstract": "Language is the primordial element for cultural transfer in indigenous communities; if it is not practiced, there is a risk of losing it and with it, a large part of the history of a community. Ecuador is a multicultural and multiethnic country with 18 indigenous peoples. Currently, in this country, some native languages are at risk of disappearing due to factors such as racial discrimination, underestimation of the language, and, above all, the lack of interest and motivation of the new generations to learn this language. Information technologies have made it possible to create mobile applications such as games, dictionaries, and translators that promote the learning of the Kichwa language. However, the acceptance of technology has not been evaluated, nor the intention to involve mobile devices in the process of teaching this language. Subsequently the objective of this work is to explore the acceptance of technology and the use of mobile devices to motivate the learning of the Kichwa language. For this purpose, the mobile application “Otavalo Rimay” was used with several students of a Kichwa language learning center. The methodology used to verify the hypothesis of this work was Design Sciences Research (DSR) together with the theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The instrument used for this evaluation was a survey carried out after the use of the mobile application. The statistical analysis of the results obtained indicates characteristics such as the utility and perceived ease of use, positively influence students to motivate the use of mobile devices in learning a language. The results also show the great technological acceptance by students for learning and confirm that currently, mobile learning is accepted for use in education.",
