Forest, T. Meynard,\n J.J Huselstein, D. Flumian, C. Rizet, A. Lacarnoy\n \nRecent Uninterruptible Power Supply systems,  in the medium \npower range (a few 100 kW), are based on a three-power stage \ntopology including a rectifier, an inverter, and a DC-DC converter. \nThe DC-DC converter ensures the charger / discharger function \nnecessary for battery management. The Monolithic InterCell \nTransformer (ICT) described in this paper is dedicated to such a \ncharger/discharger, of which the nominal power is 137kW.

INTRODUCTION\nhe hardware used in critical infrastructures, such as \ndigital networks and data centers, must include \nUninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) [1] to ensure \navailability in case of failure in the AC supply \nnetwork. The electrical power of these UPS units is increasing \ncontinuously and can now reach up to one Megawatt. In this \ncontext, manufacturers are developing modular UPS systems \nthat are able to cover a broad power range by associating a \nvariable number of modules. \nThe magnetic device described in the present paper is \ndedicated to a DC-DC converter that constitutes a part of a \nfuture “on-line” and modular UPS system, currently under \ndevelopment. This DC-DC converter provides the \ncharger/discharger function of the UPS. It controls the battery \ncharge under normal operation and supplies the DC bus from \nbatteries in case of AC grid failure. In the case considered \nhere, the maximal power of that charger/discharger is 137kW. \nIt is the basic DC-DC module for the future range and several \nunits can be parallelized to build a more powerful stage. \nAs the on-line UPS system is always in operation, the \nefficiency of the AC/DC/AC part is a very important feature: \nthe higher its value, the lower is the operating cost. In the same \nmanner, increasing the efficiency of the charger/discharger \nincreases battery autonomy in backup mode. \nTo improve efficiency, the converter topology and the \npower semi-conductor devices must be carefully evaluated, \ncompared, and selected [2]-[9]. We do not address this part of \nthe design in the present paper, but the conclusion was reached \nthat series-parallel multi-cell converter topologies using \ninterleaving, such as that presented Figure 2, were an \ninteresting option for obtaining very low semiconductor \nlosses. This paper is focused on the design, construction, and \ntesting of the eight-phase InterCell Transformer (ICT, \n[10][13]) that has been chosen to interconnect the different \ncells, in an effort to increase the efficiency and decrease the \nweight of the battery-side filter (it must be possible for a \nmaintenance operator to be able to handle the DC-DC rack). \nThe main originality lies in the high number of cells and the \nmonolithic shape of the ICT, two points that make it possible \nto obtain good characteristics for the magnetic part of the \nfilter. \nThe first part of the paper briefly presents the general \narrangement of the full UPS system and the topology of the \ncharger/discharger, including the eight-phase monolithic ICT. \nThe second part describes the design process that was \ndeveloped explicitly for this very specialized magnetic device. \nThe final design is provided by an optimization routine that is \nchecked in the end by different 2D and 3D Finite Element \n(FE) simulations to evaluate both electromagnetic and thermal \nparameters. \nIn the third part, we present the construction of the ICT \nprototype, essentially composed of eight specific U cores. \nThen the ICT prototype is placed in a test converter that \nreproduces the conditions of future operations. The monolithic \nICT requires a very good current balance between the different \nphases and therefore, the control part includes an original \ncircuit using differential current sensors. Lastly, we present the \nresults of experiments using 137kW nominal power. These \nresults validate the design parameters and confirm the interest \nof the ICT solution. \nII. GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE UPS SYSTEM\nA. Global design\nThe general arrangement of the full UPS system is given in \nFigure 1. It is obtained by adding the three stages: the rectifier \nthat generates the DC bus from the AC network (normal \noperation); the inverter that generates output voltages (normal \noperations and backup mode); and the charger/discharger \n(normal operations and backup mode). \nT \n1\nAccep  us ipt\nFigure 1: UPS arrangement \nFigure 2: Multi-cell ICT DC-DC converter \nThis scheme\n shows a particular specificity of UPS system, \nthat is, organization around a neutral point that makes the three \noutput phases independent, while facilitating operations with \nunbalanced loads. \nIn addition, the UPS system must be able to operate both on \n400V and 480V AC networks. Therefore, the DC-DC bus \nvoltage is regulated between 800V (400V AC) and 900V \n(480V AC). \nB. Multi-cell ICT DC-DC converter\nThe DC-DC converter is the charger/discharger component \nin the system. In discharge mode, it must provide nominal \npower of 137kW to the inverter stage from the batteries \n(nominal voltage 480V). In that mode, battery voltage can \nvary between 550V under full charge and 380V closer to the \ndischarged state. In the most critical case, i.e. 380V, the total \ncurrent on the battery side can reach 360A. It is the main \nlocation of current stress in the system. Therefore, in order to \nuse the same power semiconductor devices in the different \nstages (for modularity), a series-parallel DC-DC converter is \nchosen (Figure 2). The rectifier and inverter stages are \nsimilarly arranged with, in each phase, two 600V cells \nconnected in series on the capacitive divider. To provide the \nsame power, the DC-DC converter theoretically needs at last \nthree similar stages (6 cells), but in practice four stages (8 \ncells) are used because of the lower battery voltage and the \nresulting high current. This even number makes it possible to \ndesign an efficient and symmetrical monolithic ICT. \n2\nAccepted Ma sc pt\nTherefore, to allow interleaving of the eight cells and to \nminimize \nthe size filter, an eight-phase ICT is used, which is \nthe topic of the present paper. The converter control sequence \nis defined to generate an eight-phase voltage system \n(frequency Fsw) composed of the four voltages of both groups \n(referenced with respect to the neutral point). \nIII. OPERATION AND DESIGN OF THE MONOLITHIC ICT\nThe monolithic ICT is the main originality of the proposed \nDC-DC converter. Using an ICT makes it possible to minimize\nthe magnetic part of the battery filter, as compared to a\nseparate inductor solution. The counterpart is the specific core\nrequired by this solution. Section IV.A shows how the\nproblem was solved with low cost ferrite cores.\nA. Simplified modeling and operation\nThe ICT principle has been widely described in [10][13]. \nICTs can be monolithic or they can be built with separate \ntransformers. The optimal operating mode is obtained by \nmeans of particular sequences of the multi-phase supply \nvoltage system [10][11][12]. In case of high number of cells, \nthey can replace the separate inductors without an additional \noutput inductor. Therefore, it is a gapless device that allows \nthe introduction of high induction materials such as \nnanocrystalline. \nA monolithic ICT is a k-phase magnetic device that uses a \nmonolithic magnetic core with k winding legs (or columns) \nlinked by 2k linking legs. The ICT must be quasi-symmetrical \nin order to obtain a proper electrical balancing. Assembly of \nthe magnetic core must also be as simple as possible. The \nshape shown on Figure 3-a corresponds to these requirements. \nIt imposes an even phase-number but can be achieved by \nassociating k U cores ( see section IV.A .). This shape was \ntherefore chosen for the present work. \nTo describe ICT operation in the particular converter shown \nin Figure 2, and to obtain the basis for design, a simplified \nreluctance modeling is proposed (Figure 3-b), from which an \nelectrical model is derived. Each column has a reluctance R. A \ncolumn is connected with adjacent columns through linking \nlegs that have a reluctance 2 RT. If the leakage flux due to one \ncell is considered, one part noted \nΦakout flows through the air\noutside of the ICT; another part noted Φakin flows inside the\nwindow between two columns. Reluctances Rakout and Rakin are \nattributed respectively to both leakage zones. By considering \nthe symmetry assumption, all ICT-phases have the same \nleakage flux Φakin + Φakout that constitute one k th of the total\nICT leakage flux. The complete description of the ICT is \nobtained by connecting k identical cells in a ring. This is used \nin section III.B.2) to estimate flux repartition and core losses. \nTo describe the principle of ICT operation, it is simpler to \nignore the reluctances RT with respect to the reluctances Rakin \nand also to ignore the winding resistances. With these \nassumptions, the reluctance network becomes that of Figure 4-\na, with: \n–\nΦp , flux in column p\n– Φak = Φakin + Φakout, leakage flux between two phases\n– R, column reluctance\n– Rak = Rakin + Rakout,\n– n, turn number by phase,\n– L = n²/R and Lak = n²/(Rak + R) \nFigure 4-b shows the arrangement and the notations that are\nused subsequently in this paper. It is assumed that both output \nvoltages are balanced and equal to vo/2. \na - Shape \nb – Reluctance model for a cell \nFigure 3: Shape and cell-mo\ndel of the monolithic ICT \n1) Equations\nThe flux in a column is given by:\ndt\ndΦnvv v\npo\ncellpp = − =2\n(1) \nB\ny summing on the k phases: \ndt\nΦdnk\nv\nv ak\nk\n1 p\ncellp\no  \n2 − =\n∑\n= (2)\nHop\nkinson law for one phase: ak ak p pΦR RΦi n   = − (3)\nBy summing on the k phases: akako2 o1  R)Φ k (R ) i (i n+ = +  (4)\nFrom (2) and (4) it follows: \ndt\n) i d (i\nk \nL\nk\nv\n2\nv o2 o1 ak\nk\n1 p\ncellp\no +− =\n∑\n= (5 ) \nThe first term of (5) corresponds to the generation of the \ninterleaved voltage, its frequency is k.Fsw.

As a consequence, \nall phase currents ip are identical (equation (6) with imp = 0) \nand  io1 = io2 =io. In the real case, the magnetizing currents are \nsummed (imT) in the neutral point line.

The coupled inductor of this model has a coupling ratio\nequal to 1 and a mutual inductance M equal to Lak. This points\nout the characteristic properties of ICTs:\n– An output voltage resulting in the interleaving of input\nvoltages (frequency kFsw, amplitude Vp /k). \n– Output voltage is applied to an output inductor that\ncorresponds to the total leakage flux. It determines the ripple \noutput current (frequency kF sw) if any additional inductor is \nintroduced. \n– If magnetizing currents are ignored, phase-currents are\nidentical. \nThese properties suppose an interleaving control sequence, \ni.e. the input voltages have the same form and are regularly\nphase-shifted (2\nπ/k).\nFigure 5: Electrical model of the ICT \nCompared \nto a version that uses separate transformers, the \nmonolithic ICT leads to a weight and volume decrease, which \nis why it was chosen in the present development. There is a \nsimple way to see this decrease: to design a phase-transformer \nusing the separate transformer option [10], the initial winding \n(turn number n ) is separated into two windings (turn number \nn/2) that must be connected to two converter cells (electrical \ncoupling). In this case, the core areas are identical in both \noptions. As shown in Figure 6, the E-I core of the separate-\ntransformer needs closing magnetic legs that do not exist in the \nmonolithic ICT. \nConversely, the monolithic ICT is more difficult to build \ndue to the need for a customized core. Section IV.A shows \nhow this problem was solved in the present case. \na – Separate transformer (cyclic cascade) b – Monolithic ICT \nFigure 6: Magnetic part r\neduction in monolithic ICT \nB. Design\nThe design of ICT basically involves the same steps as the \ndesign of other magnetic components [15]: \n– Determine the current and flux densities based on circuit\nexcitations and geometrical parameters.\n– Deduce loss densities in the various parts, and then total\nlosses by integration over the full volume.\n– Estimate the temperature rise using a thermal model that\ntakes into account the geometry and size of the ICT as well\nas external conditions (temperature, natural/forced\nconvection).\nThen, these steps can be included in an optimization process\nto make the temperature rise compliant with material limits,\nwhile minimizing an objective function (e. g. weight).\n4\nAccepted M u pt\nHowever, in the case of the ICT, these steps involve specific \nproblems \nthat can be summarized as follows:  \n– Current ripples depend on the leakage flux with a\nsignificant part flowing unguided in the air, which makes the\ninductances difficult to evaluate.\n– This may be a high frequency current ripple, thus flowing\nunevenly through the conductors.\n– The flux waveforms in some regions of the ICT can differ\nsignificantly from the sinusoidal waveforms used to\ncharacterize materials, and even determining the pk-pk flux\nis not always trivial; both of these factors make evaluating\ncore losses a difficult task.\nThe following section describes how these questions were\naddressed to define a general design method and apply it to \nthis component. Simplified models of the various aspects of \nthe design were developed and included in a Matlab \noptimization routine. More accurate calculations are proposed \noutside the optimization routine to check the design before \nconstruction of the prototype. \n1) Winding losses and leakage inductances\nThe design of a monolithic ICT such as that in Figure 3 is,\nstrictly-speaking, a 3D electromagnetic problem, especially \nwhen AC resistance and leakage fluxes are concerned. \nHowever, it is interesting and possible to develop a design \nprocedure using simpler models. The proposed method is to \nidentify cutting planes (2D) that can be slid to make an \napproximate 3D description of the ICT. Figure 7-b shows such \na cutting plane that was be used for the present shape. It \ncorresponds to the external parts of the columns (reference \nsizes on Figure 7-b). The cutting plane can be found all around \nthe ICT, excepted in the winding windows and corners, and \ndoes not take into account the center of the ICT. In the \nfollowing, it is assumed that the electromagnetic energy and \ncurrent densities calculated on this plane in 2D conditions are \nclose to those of the same plane in the real 3D configuration. \n3D FE simulations (COMSOL) confirmed the validity of this \nassumption. The 3D estimations are thus made by sliding the \ncutting plane along the ICT faces (Figure 7-c) to calculate the \ntotal electromagnetic energy in the volume. In this approach, \nthe 1D analytic model derived by Dowel [15] is used in the \nwindows, but the electromagnetic energy in the winding \ncorner zones and at the center of the ICT is ignored. Therefore, \nthe leakage inductance is under-estimated and current ripple \noverestimated. A similar method is applied to the calculation \nof the AC winding losses. \nTo make that 2D-3D method more compliant with a design \nroutine including optimization, i.e. avoiding 2D FE simulation \non each step, a response surface using intensive a priori  \nsimulation was created. 2D Finite Element simulations \n(FEMM software) with different values for geometrical \nparameters (Figure 7-a) were made for different frequencies \nand for common mode currents ( Icellp=+Icellp+1), as well as \ndifferential mode currents ( Icellp=-Icellp+1). The results are the \nvalues of AC resistances/meter and leakage inductances/meter \nfor both modes. This database file is used subsequently by the \ndesign routine to evaluate AC resistances, leakage \ninductances, and magnetizing inductances by means of \ninterpolation. The total AC winding loss density of the plane is \ncalculated by summing up the contributions of the different \nharmonic currents (DC, AC common mode and AC \ndifferential mode). The total winding losses and leakage \nenergy are then calculated by 3D estimation. \na – ICT phase sizes b – Used cutting plane \nc – Sliding of cutting planes for 3D estimations \nFigure 7: Modeling of the k-\nphase ICT \n2) Core Losses\nIn the monolithic ICT, the electrical circuit imposes a square\nAC voltage across the winding that induces a triangular flux in \nthe vertical legs (1), of which peak amplitude can be \ndetermined easily: \nsw\nDC\nDC\nsw\npmax 8nF\nVVnF\nDD(1maxΦ =⎥⎦\n⎤\n⎢⎣\n⎡ −= 2\n)  (9) \nD being the \nduty-cycle \nFrom the leakage inductance calculations of the previous \nstep, the reluctance values corresponding to the network of \nFigure 3 can be estimated. The knowledge of this network, and \nof the shape of fluxes Φp, enables us to deduce the other fluxes \nin the other parts of the core (Figure 8).  \nAs a first approach, i.e. during the optimization process, \ncore losses are evaluated using the peak-to-peak values of \nthese fluxes that are introduced in a modified Steinmetz model \n[15], of which the form is:  \n( )\n) .

Normalization based on the maximum triangular flux. \n3) Thermal model\nIn the final system, the ICT is cooled by a forced-air flow\nwith an input temperature equal to 55°C (UPS system \nspecification). A first step is to assume that core and winding \ntemperatures are homogenous. Their respective exchange \nsurfaces are calculated as a function of the different size and \nshape parameters. Based on experience, by considering the \nsize range of the ICT and the air-speed expected in the final \nsystem (5m/s), the exchange coefficient value is set to \n35W/K/m². \n4) Design by optimization\nThe ICT is defined as a 3D object by means of a set of\nparameters that includes independent size parameters and the \nnumber of cells. Using the previously described approach, the \ngeometrical dimensions (hc, dc, hw, ec and the number of turns) \nare varied by means of Matlab’s standard fmincon gradient \nroutine, which tends to minimize weight (sum of core weight \nand conductor weight is the optimization function) while \nchecking that core losses, winding losses and the thermal \nmodel predict an acceptable temperature rise (inequality \nconstraint). In this case, the number of cells was not allowed to \nvary. The only original point of our approach is probably that \nthe current ripple, which is often considered as a specification \nfor magnetic design, is considered here as a simple \nunconstrained output. In fact, high current ripples tend to \nincrease losses, and optimizing for weight naturally limits this \ncurrent ripple to an acceptable level.  \nConcerning the initial guess, a good practice seems to be to \nstart with an ICT that satisfies constraints to help convergence. \nWith this kind of problem, it is sufficient to consider a large \nICT as an initial guess to allow the algorithm to converge. \nThe optimization results are given in Table 1. Figure 9 \nshows the initial guess and the final device. \nTABLE 1: OPTIMIZATION RESULTS \nhc 91.54mm Volc 878cm3 \ndc 29.0 0mm VolTot 1,478cm3 \nhw 67.5 5mm Weightw 1.625kg \nec 99.9 2mm Weightc 4.089kg \nGeometrical \nvalues \nVolw 600cm3 We\nightTot 5.714kg \nVCell 400V J 3. 47A/mm² \nIcell 90A PwTot al 269W \nFsw 20kHz PwH F 33W \nLak 12.9μH Ripple Δip 6.5A \nElectrical \nvalues \nLmagn 562μH Efficien\ncy 99.77% \nn 15 Pc 72W \nBDC 0.1269T PTo t 341W Magnetic \nvalues Bmax 0.36\n0T\nhexchw 35W/K/m ² Δθw 45°C Thermal \nvalues hexchc 35W/K/\nm² Δθc 32°C \nIndex w for winding, index c for co re, see figure 7-a for ICT size notations \nFigure 9: Dimensions of the ICT, Right: initial guess, Left: optimized device \nThe calculated material volume is less than two liters and \nthe weight is close to 6 kg. The core temperature is 85°C and \nthe winding temperature is 100°C. The current ripple per cell \nis very low (around 5A), this being one of the advantages of \nthat particular magnetic solution compared to classic separated \ninductors. \nIn the present case, the part of the HF winding losses PwHF \nin the total winding losses PwTotal is low, but this is due to the \nlow value of current ripple. It should be noted that other \nconfigurations can bring very high AC losses and it is \nnecessary to include the AC loss calculation in the general \ndesign method. It can be also observed that the core losses are \nsignificantly lower than the conductor losses. This is related to \nthe medium frequency used (20 kHz). For such a value, the \ncore size is mainly determined by the maximal induction in the \nmaterial and not by the core losses, which remain low. \n5) Final check\nWith optimization converged, several checks can be made:\nAC resistance and leakage inductance are calculated via finite \nelements with the optimized dimensions to improve the \nestimation made by interpolation. In the present case, the main \nverification concerns the leakage inductance that imposes the \ncurrent ripple. The value extracted from this checking \n6\nAcce d M uscript\nsimulation is Lak = 13. 5µH, to be compared with the 12.5µH \nvalue given by the interpolation. To verify this leakage \ninductance range, a 3D FE simulation (COMSOL) was added \nand gives a value of 18.4 µH. This is significantly higher, \nwhich is in accordance with the under-estimation of the 2D-3D \nmethod evoked III.B.1). The difference is close to 30% but the \ncurrent ripple estimation does not require more accuracy, \nconsidering its low value. \nCore losses are also re-calculated. Knowing the fluxes and \ninduction in all branches of the core, the iGSE [16][17] is \napplied to these complicated waveforms (Figure 8) to estimate \nthe extra losses induced by the dB/dt that is significantly \nhigher than that of a triangular waveform with the same pk-pk \namplitude. In this design, we find that the maximum pk-pk \ninduction (obtained at 50% duty cycle) is 0.37T in the \nwindings and 0.44T in the linking legs, but it is mainly the \nhigher dB/dt observed in linking legs that generates a higher \nloss density (95kW/m 3 in the linking legs vs. 60kW/m 3 in the \nwinding legs). As a consequence, the total core losses are re-\nevaluated at 86W instead of 69W in the optimization process. \nLastly, temperature estimations are verified by 3D FE \nsimulations (ANSYS icepack). The virtual calculated device is \nplaced in an air-flow with an  input temperature of 55°C and a \nspeed of 5m/s. Simulation results are given in Figure 10. The \nair input is on the front side. \nFigure 10: 3D EF thermal simulations, windings (top), and core (bottom) \nThe average exch\nange coefficient values extracted from \nthese results are 37W/K/m² for the windings and 42W/K/m² \nfor the core. This is close to the value used in optimization \n(35W/K/m²). The core exchange coefficient is not as good, but \nwith the core temperature still being on the safe side, we \ndecided to stick to this design. It can be observed that the \nassumption of a homogeneous surface temperature is correct. \nIndeed, the winding temperature range is [96.2°C to 102.4°C] \nand the core temperature range is [76.8°C to 77.8°C]. These \nresults can be compared to those generated by the optimization \nroutine which are respectively 100°C (45°C + 55°C) and 85°C \n(30°C + 55°C). \nIt should be noted that the first guess is not always this good \nand that a general design process may require at least a second \niteration to fit the exchange coefficients. \nC. Comparison with a classic solution using inductors\nIn parallel to ICT development, an inductor solution was \nalso extrapolated from the design of previous products \n(tradeoff between current ripple and losses). In the latter case, \neach converter cell includes two inductors such as those in \nFigure 11 (inductor manufacturer’s proposal). The compared \ncharacteristics are given in Table 2. The ICT solution is widely \nbetter, regardless of the considered parameter. \nTABLE 2: COMPARED CHARACTERISTICS \nICT inductors\nMaterial-core Ferrite-U Kool µ-toroid\nNumber 1 8 x 2 (192µH) \nTotal weight 6kg 9.2kg \nMax ripple current by cell 6.5A 53A \nLosses  340W 650W \nCost X 1.4X\nFigure 11: Elementary inductance of the classic design \nIV. BUILDING AND CHAR\nACTERIZATIONS\nA. Building\nFerrite materials are the most appropriate in the present \ncase, considering the switching frequency and the cost \nparameter. On this basis, the simplest way to build the \nproposed ICT is to associate eight U ferrite cores, each of them \nsupporting phase winding. As standard U cores do not having \nthe right dimension, special U cores were produced by a ferrite \nmanufacturer. A photo of the prototype and a view of the U-\ncell are shown in Figure 12. \nSuch an assembly creates air-gaps on the linking legs. Their \nvalue is estimated at nearly 50µm. The only consequence of \nthis is a decrease in magnetizing inductance, but the \nmagnetizing currents remain negligible compared to the main \ncurrents. \nSome preliminary measurements were made concerning the \ninductance values with an impedance analyzer. Measured \nleakage and magnetizing inductances are respectively \nLak = 16.6µH and Lmagn = 500µH. These values are close to \nthose given by the design routine. \nB. Test bench\nBecause the power DC/DC converter prototype is currently \nbeing developed, the ICT was tested on a test bench shown \nFigure 13. \n7\nA d Manuscript\nFigure 12: View of the prototype \nIt consist\ns of eight standard water-cooled IGBT legs. The \nproposed topology enables reproducing the operating \nconditions of the ICT in the future converter, but only needs a \n400V DC power supply and a low-value resistor. Conversely \nto the final converter, both groups of four legs  are connected \nin parallel on the power supply and operate in an opposition \nmode, one being the generator, the other being the receiver. \nThe duty cycles of both groups must be very close, with the \nvoltage difference being applied to a quasi-short-circuit. The \ncontrol part realizes two functions: adjustment of the current \nflowing between both groups, and balancing the eight cell \ncurrents. \n1) Opposition current control\nThe principle of the opposition method applied to power\nelectronic converters is described in [18]. To control the \ncurrent flowing between both power stages, a differential duty \ncycle \nδD must be generated, ideally by means of a closed\ncurrent loop. The present test bench operates in an open loop \nwith a low resistor (0.025 Ω) that allows limiting the control\nsensitivity. Control is handled by an FPGA board. It generates \nthe eight PWM orders with a basic duty cycle D, identical for \neach cell. A second control level generates the differential duty \ncycle \nδD, adjustable in steps of 1/1000. Then, the output\ncurrent can be adjusted by a step of (400V). δD/0.025Ω = 16A,\nto compare with the nominal value of 360A. The control \nsequence is given in Figure 14. \n2) Current balance\nTo ensure correct operations of the ICT, the phase currents\nmust be balanced. Indeed, unbalanced conditions cause an \naverage magnetic field to appear in the core, which can induce \nmagnetic saturation. In the present case, a preliminary test has \nshown that the unbalance current must be lower than 1A, a \nvery weak value compared to the nominal current of 90A. \nTo provide balance conditions [19][20], the chosen solution \nis to use differential current measurements on each four-cell \ngroup, e.g. measuring i1 – i2, i1 – i3, i1 – i4 for the first group, in \norder to obtain high accuracy on the unbalance estimation. \nMeasurement is obtained by means of three hall effect sensors \nwith low current capability (25A), but able to accept the \ncrossing of two cell-lines (Figure 16). A fourth sensor (100A \ncapability) is added to measure one of the cell-currents, here i1. \nThe differential measurements are then used to implement \nclosed-loop balancing according to the principle illustrated in \nFigure 15. \nFigure 13: Circuit for the ICT test \n8\nAcc  M script\nFigure 14: Control sequence \nFigure 15: Differential balance loops for one four-cell group \nThe analog\n signals provided by the differential sensors are \ndigitalized on the control board that performs the following \ncalculations (scale factors are not considered): \n[(i1 – i2) + (i1 – i3) + (i1 – i4)]/4 = i1 – (i1 + i2+ i3 + i4)/4 = ical \n(11) \nthen \nical – (i1 – i2) = i2 – (i1 + i2+ i3 +i4)/4 (12) \nical – (i1 – i3) = i3 – (i1 + i2+ i3 +i4)/4 (13) \nical – (i1 – i4) = i4 – (i1 + i2+ i3 +i4)/4 (14) \nThe results of (12) to (14) constitute accurate estimations of \nthe difference between each phase current and the average of \nthe four currents. Lastly, they are used as feedback values to \ncorrect the duty-cycle on each cell. This action tends to cancel \nthe three current differences, therefore to cancel the unbalance. \nThe i1 measurement is used in the final system to regulate the \ntotal output courant, equal to 4 i1 if the currents are balanced. \nThe same control strategy is applied to the second cell-group \nwith an input duty cycle equal to D + \nδD.\nTo summarize, the control board generates three levels of \nduty cycles: the main duty cycle D, the duty cycle δD to adjust\nthe current flowing between both cell-groups and the corrected \nduty cycles Dcell1-Dcell8  to balance the phase-currents. \nFigure 16 shows several views of the test bench. A shunt \n(1% accuracy) is introduced in each cell output to measure and \ncompare the average current values. \nFigure 16: Test bench \nC. Experi\nmental results\nThe test bench validated ICT operation and the balancing \nloop robustness. The oscillograms in Figure 17 show the four \ncurrents of one of the four-cell groups, and the voltage across \none of the IGBTs for nominal power operation (400V-\n90A/cell). The inlay gives the average values of the same four \ncurrents. Very good current balancing can be observed, with \nthe maximal difference (0.8%) between two measurements \nprobably being due to shunt accuracy. \nDuring the test, a first verification of ICT thermal behavior \nwas made by means of an infrared camera. For the final \nsystem, it is planned to place the ICT in a ventilation tunnel \nbehind the power semi-conductor devices. The expected \ntemperature and speed of the incoming air should be 55°C and \n5m/s respectively. This configuration is not reproduced in the \ntest bench. Nevertheless, the ICT is placed on two horizontal \nfans providing an air-speed of 3.5m/s and the ambient \ntemperature was about 25°C. Un fortunately, the thermal \nconditions of this free space disposition cannot be correctly \ndefined in an Finite Element  analysis. \nFigure 18 shows an infrared image of the ICT for nominal \npower operation and under thermal stability conditions. The \nsurface temperatures fall within a 55°C to 72°C range. \n9\nAc d Manuscript\nFigure 17: Waveforms at nominal operating point \nFigure 18: ICT infrared image for nominal operating points \nEven this result cannot\n directly be compared in detail to the \nsimulation of Figure 10, because of the different ventilation \nconditions, it nonetheless allow us to make some observations: \n- The surface temperature range is in accordance with\ndesign estimations. Indeed, the increase in temperature range \nfrom the ambient temperature is 30°C to 47°C, close to the \n32°C to 45°C range of the design. \n- The good fit of temperatures demonstrates the good loss\nestimation given by the design routine. \n- While a more detailed analysis still must be made for the\nfinal system, these results definitely validate the proposed ICT \ndesign. \nV. CONCLUSION\nThe aim of this paper is to demonstrate the interest of ICTs \nin the context of UPS systems, in the medium power range. \nMost manufacturers currently evaluate solutions based on \nmulti-cell converter topologies for their future systems. The \ninterleaving of cells is likely to become a standard \nconfiguration in the next generation of UPS systems. \nTherefore, the monolithic ICT is a very attractive option to be \nassociated with these developments. In comparison to the \nseparate inductor option, the monolithic ICT allows reducing \nweight, volume, current ripples, and cost. \nTo obtain these properties, it is necessary to have thorough \nknowledge of the characteristics and operation of this \nparticular magnetic device, and to develop tools able to \noptimize its design. That is the aim of the two first parts of this \npaper describing the modeling approach and design routine \nsuggested by the authors. \nBuilding and testing a non-standard magnetic device are \nother original steps of that work, as presented in the third part \nof the paper. First, it is shown how a monolithic ICT can be \nbuilt with ferrite U-cores to provide a competitive industrial \nsolution, and a prototype is presented. Then, the prototype is \nplaced in a test bench developed with standard IGBT legs, \nwhich use the opposition method and balancing differential \nloops implemented in an FPGA control board. \nLastly, experimental results obtained under nominal power \nconditions are presented. They confirm the efficiency of the \ndesign tools, with the characteristics of the prototype being \nclose to those defined by the optimization routine and, \nconsidering these characteristics, the high potential of the ICT \nsolution. \nREFERENCES \n[1] M.
