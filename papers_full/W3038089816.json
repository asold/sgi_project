  "abstract": "This paper explores the working principle and applications of an Arduino board.This also explores on how it can be used as a tool for study and research works.Arduino board can provide a quick tool in development of VLSI test bench especially of sensors.Main advantages are fast processing and easy interface.Today, with increasing number of people using open source software and hardware devices day after day, technology is forming a new dimension by making complicated things look easier and interesting.These open sources provide free or virtually low costs, highly reliable and affordable technology.This paper provides a glimpse of type of Arduino boards, working principles, software implementation and their applications.",
