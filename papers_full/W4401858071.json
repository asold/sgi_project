  "abstract": "The advent of blockchain technology has revolutionized various sectors by providing transparency, immutability, and automation. Central to this revolution are smart contracts, which facilitate trustless and automated transactions across diverse domains. However, the proliferation of smart contracts has exposed significant security vulnerabilities, necessitating advanced analysis techniques. Data dependency analysis is a critical program analysis method used to enhance the testing and security of smart contracts. This paper introduces Sligpt, an innovative methodology that integrates a large language model (LLM), specifically GPT-4o, with the static analysis tool Slither, to perform data dependency analyses on Solidity smart contracts. Our approach leverages both the advanced code comprehension capabilities of GPT-4o and the advantages of a traditional analysis tool. We empirically evaluate Sligpt using a curated dataset of Ethereum smart contracts. Sligpt achieves significant improvements in precision, recall, and overall analysis depth compared with Slither and GPT-4o, providing a robust solution for data dependency analysis. This paper also discusses the challenges encountered, such as the computational resource requirements and the inherent variability in LLM outputs, while proposing future research directions to further enhance the methodology. Sligpt represents a significant advancement in the field of static analysis on smart contracts, offering a practical framework for integrating LLMs with static analysis tools.",
