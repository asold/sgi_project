    "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Accurately modeling and predicting RNA biology has been a long-standing challenge, bearing significant clinical ramifications for variant interpretation and the formulation of tailored therapeutics. We describe a foundation model for RNA biology, “BigRNA”, which was trained on thousands of genome-matched datasets to predict tissue-specific RNA expression, splicing, microRNA sites, and RNA binding protein specificity from DNA sequence. Unlike approaches that are restricted to missense variants, BigRNA can identify pathogenic non-coding variant effects across diverse mechanisms, including polyadenylation, exon skipping and intron retention.

Frey* \n Abstract \n Accurately modeling and predicting RNA biology has been a long-standing challenge, \n bearing signiﬁcant clinical ramiﬁcations for variant interpretation and the formulation of \n tailored therapeutics.  We describe a foundation model for RNA biology, “BigRNA”, which \n was trained on thousands of genome-matched datasets to predict tissue-speciﬁc RNA \n expression, splicing, microRNA sites, and RNA binding protein speciﬁcity from DNA \n sequence.  Unlike approaches that are restricted to missense variants, BigRNA can \n identify pathogenic non-coding variant effects across diverse mechanisms, including \n polyadenylation, exon skipping and intron retention. BigRNA accurately predicted the \n effects of steric blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) on increasing the expression of 4 out \n of 4 genes, and on splicing for 18 out of 18 exons across 14 genes, including those \n involved in Wilson disease and spinal muscular atrophy.  We anticipate that BigRNA and \n foundation models like it will have widespread applications in the ﬁeld of personalized \n RNA therapeutics. \n Main \n Building machine learning models that can predict gene expression from DNA sequence \n has been a long-standing research goal  1  , and one that has seen signiﬁcant strides \n owing to recent advancements in deep learning  2  .  These models could revolutionize \n drug discovery by pinpointing how pathogenic genetic variants alter gene expression \n and gene processing, and by designing customized drug candidates to counteract these \n effects  3  .  Currently, most efforts have focused on predicting data that measures overall \n 1 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n 10 \n 11 \n 12 \n 13 \n 14 \n 15 \n 16 \n 17 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 \n 21 \n 22 \n 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n 26 \n 27 \n 28 \n 29 \n 30 \n 31 \n 32 \n 33 \n 34 \n gene expression levels  2,4  , which are not suited to predicting regulatory interventions, for \n example, speciﬁc transcriptional perturbations on splicing or polyadenylation. \n RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data provides a widely-available resource for measuring \n RNA expression at high resolution and capturing complex transcriptional regulation \n events across diverse genotypes.  This includes both exome variation inherently coded \n within RNA-seq data itself, and through extensive resources like the Genotype-Tissue \n Expression  5  (GTEx) project that pairs RNA-seq with Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). \n While building deep neural networks that directly learn from RNA-seq offers the \n opportunity to understand how changes in DNA sequence lead to changes in complex \n transcriptional phenotypes, this goal has remained elusive. \n We introduce “BigRNA”, a deep learning model that is directly trained on RNA-seq \n datasets.  BigRNA learns from paired genotype and 128bp resolution RNA expression \n data from many individuals, and can also be applied in a range of downstream tasks \n such as predicting RNA-binding protein (RBP) speciﬁcity and microRNA binding sites. \n Because BigRNA directly models RNA-seq data, it can discover a diverse set of \n pathogenic non-coding mechanisms that would each require a specialized model, and \n can pinpoint their effects on a transcript.  We show that BigRNA can discover the \n effects of non-coding variants on expression and splicing, and matches or exceeds the \n performance of specialized models in recovering known pathogenic variants. \n BigRNA can also help design different types of RNA based therapeutics, including steric \n blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs).  Without any additional training, BigRNA accurately \n identiﬁes compounds that induce a targeted splicing change, and recovers known \n approved SBO therapies with high speciﬁcity. The ability of BigRNA to understand \n regulatory mechanisms also allows it to design SBOs that block predicted inhibitory \n regions to increase the expression of a disease gene.  BigRNA represents a new \n generation of massive deep learning models that can be applied to a range of different \n personalized RNA therapeutic discovery tasks. \n Results \n BigRNA accurately predicts tissue-speciﬁc RNA expression and the binding sites of \n proteins and microRNAs \n To train BigRNA to predict RNA-seq data from the corresponding DNA sequence, we \n employed a transformer-based architecture  2  and utilized the GTEx  5  resource (  Methods  ). \n Given an individual's genotype, we input two potential haplotypes independently into \n 2 \n 35 \n 36 \n 37 \n 38 \n 39 \n 40 \n 41 \n 42 \n 43 \n 44 \n 45 \n 46 \n 47 \n 48 \n 49 \n 50 \n 51 \n 52 \n 53 \n 54 \n 55 \n 56 \n 57 \n 58 \n 59 \n 60 \n 61 \n 62 \n 63 \n 64 \n 65 \n 66 \n 67 \n 68 \n 69 \n 70 \n 71 \n identical instances of the model, and train it to predict the observed RNA-seq data as \n the combined output from these haplotypes ( \n Fig. 1a  ,  Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2  ). \n Each output \"head\" of the model predicts the expression of a single GTEx sample, so \n that it learns to predict the outputs of 2,956 RNA-seq samples from 70 individuals, \n covering 51 tissues in total.  After training on these RNA-seq datasets, the model is \n ﬁne-tuned to predict the speciﬁcity of RBP and microRNA binding sites ( \n Fig. 1a  ). \n We ﬁrst evaluated the ability of BigRNA to predict the expression of unseen genomic \n sequences.  We measured the model's ability to predict tissue-speciﬁc expression levels \n for all genes outside of genomic regions in the training set.  BigRNA exhibited strong \n performance for predicting expression levels of unseen genes, achieving a correlation \n coeﬃcient (r) between 0.47 and 0.77 across all tissues (mean=0.70, \n Fig. 1b  ). We \n observed slightly stronger performance in brain tissues than non-brain tissues (mean \n r=0.74 versus 0.69, p=5e-03), and highlight that the model is able to accurately predict \n expression levels in the hypothalamus (r=0.74, \n Fig. 1c  ). The ability to predict overall \n expression levels and capability to accurately delineate intron/exon junctions is \n illustrated by BigRNA’s predictions for  SLC7A8  , an amino acid transporter within the test \n set ( \n Fig. 1d  ). To evaluate BigRNA on the much harder task of predicting differences \n between pairs of tissues, we used BigRNA predictions to compute the fold-change in \n total exonic coverage between tissue pairs and compared that to observed \n fold-changes.  Across all inter-tissue comparisons, we observed a mean correlation of \n r=0.4, owing to the increased diﬃculty of this task ( \n Fig. 1e  ).  We highlight a comparison \n between liver and the hypothalamus (r=0.58, p=7e-64,  Fig. 1f  ) to illustrate this capability. \n Since drug discovery tasks beneﬁt from clarity of mechanisms, we next examined how \n well the ﬁne-tuned BigRNA model could predict RBP binding speciﬁcity and microRNA \n binding sites. For the RBP task, we used a large-scale resource of transcriptome-wide \n binding proﬁles for 223 datasets covering 150 unique human RBPs in K562 and HepG2 \n cells  6  . We found that BigRNA achieved high average precision for many RBPs and \n performed better than the previously-published DeepRiPe  7  system for all 142 datasets \n that they had in common ( \n Fig. 1g  ). On predicting microRNA binding sites, BigRNA \n achieved a median AUC of 0.84 and for all 12 cell lines that we tested, performed better \n than a previously published method, TargetScan  8  ( \n Fig. 1h  ). These predictions are useful \n for identifying regulatory factors that are altered by variants and SBOs (see below). \n Predicting the effects of variants on gene expression \n A key challenge in human genetics is to predict the impact of sequence variants that \n may be found within the human population.  Many deep learning models that do well on \n 3 \n 72 \n 73 \n 74 \n 75 \n 76 \n 77 \n 78 \n 79 \n 80 \n 81 \n 82 \n 83 \n 84 \n 85 \n 86 \n 87 \n 88 \n 89 \n 90 \n 91 \n 92 \n 93 \n 94 \n 95 \n 96 \n 97 \n 98 \n 99 \n 100 \n 101 \n 102 \n 103 \n 104 \n 105 \n 106 \n 107 \n 108 \n 109 \n 110 \n unseen genes using certain metrics, such as AlphaFold  9  , struggle to predict variant \n effects  10  .  While some accurate methods exist for predicting the pathogenic impact of \n rare missense variants  11,12  , non-coding variants, such as those located within the 3' and \n 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes, remain diﬃcult to interpret. \n To address this gap, we evaluate BigRNA’s ability to predict the impact of a curated set \n of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) UTR variants from ClinVar  13  . We found that \n BigRNA exhibited strong performance as a general pathogenicity model for variants in \n both the 3’ UTR and 5’ UTR  (AUC=0.95 and 0.8, \n Fig. 2a  ) by predicting their effects on \n the expression of their associated disease genes.  The weaker performance in the 5’ \n UTR may be due to a smaller proportion of P/LP variants that modulate RNA expression \n (18/47 compared to 16/17 for the 3’ UTR amongst variants with known mechanisms, \n p=0.046), and a substantial proportion of mechanisms that affect translation (29/47). \n We further investigated a known pathogenic expression-decreasing variant in the 3’ UTR \n of  NAA10  14  (NM_003491.4:c.*43A>G).  This variant is known to cause syndromic \n X-linked microphthalmia, and reduces expression by disrupting the polyadenylation site \n (PAS) of the  NAA10  transcript.  The BigRNA predictions highlight the \n expression-decreasing effects of this variant (false positive rate, FPR <0.5%), and also \n predicted the expected lengthening of the 3’ UTR that was observed in RNA-seq \n samples of affected patients  14  ( \n Fig. 2b  ).  An  in-silico  saturation mutagenesis near this \n variant highlighted the importance of the PAS, and conﬁrmed the effects of two other \n nearby P/LP variants (c.*39A>G, c.*40A>G)  14  ( \n Fig. 2c  ). \n We compared BigRNA to Framepool  15  , a ribosomal load model, Saluki  16  , an RNA stability \n model, and Enformer  2  , an expression model that learns from CAGE-seq.  We observed \n improved performance compared to Enformer for pathogenic variants in both the 5’ and \n 3’ UTR (p=0.04 and p=0.02, respectively,  Supplementary Fig. S3  ).  Framepool, a model \n that predicts ribosomal load  15  , performed similarly to BigRNA for pathogenic variant \n classiﬁcation in the 5’ UTR (AUC=0.67 versus 0.78 for BigRNA, p=0.07,  Supplementary \n Fig. S3  ), but BigRNA performed better at classifying the subset of pathogenic 5’ UTR \n variants that are known to modulate RNA expression (AUC=0.61 versus 0.86 for \n BigRNA, p=0.002,  Supplementary Fig. S4  ). Saluki, an RNA half-life model, had similar \n performance on the 3’ UTR task (AUC=0.87 vs 0.94 for BigRNA, p=0.27). \n Within these genes, we noted many variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS) in their \n untranslated regions.  Applying BigRNA to these variants at a 5% FPR yielded 12 \n potential expression-modulating variants in the 3’ UTR (out a total of 139) and 23 in the \n 5’ UTR (out a total of 222) ( \n Fig. 2d  ).  For example, the 3’ UTR of  HBB  had the highest \n number of VUSs surpassing this threshold (n=6).  The highest scoring VUS \n 4 \n 111 \n 112 \n 113 \n 114 \n 115 \n 116 \n 117 \n 118 \n 119 \n 120 \n 121 \n 122 \n 123 \n 124 \n 125 \n 126 \n 127 \n 128 \n 129 \n 130 \n 131 \n 132 \n 133 \n 134 \n 135 \n 136 \n 137 \n 138 \n 139 \n 140 \n 141 \n 142 \n 143 \n 144 \n 145 \n 146 \n 147 \n 148 \n 149 \n (NM_000518.5(HBB):c.*112A>T) is in the PAS of this gene, and shares the same \n position as a known pathogenic variant (c.*112A>G)  .  The PAS region of  HBB  also \n contains the majority of known P/LP variants (6 of 8).  The second-highest scoring VUS \n (c.*47C>G) was outside of the PAS, and less is known about its function.  Looking \n further, we found that despite being classiﬁed as a VUS, this variant is reported to cause \n decreased expression of  HBB  , supporting the BigRNA prediction  17  .  We also noted that \n three additional P/LP variants in the  HBB  PAS, which were not included in our \n benchmark due to a lack of evidence in the ClinVar submission  13  , scored above this \n threshold ( \n Fig. 2e  ), providing computational support for their P/LP classiﬁcation. \n In more genetically complex diseases, it can be challenging to discover causal \n expression-modulating variant(s) due to linkage disequilibrium (LD).  For example, \n rs705379 and rs854572 are both annotated as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) \n for Paraoxonase 1 (  PON1  ) in GTEx, but a luciferase reporter assay and statistical \n ﬁne-mapping of the locus show that only rs705379 has an effect on expression  18,19  , \n which is consistent with BigRNA’s prediction of a much stronger effect and its direction, \n despite the strong LD. BigRNA also assigned a stronger effect, and correct direction, for \n two other known expression modulation variants,  rs854571 and rs3735590  20  ( \n Fig. 2f  ). \n To benchmark BigRNA more broadly, we evaluated its ability to identify ﬁne-mapped \n eQTLs from negative controls matched on effector gene (eGene), distance to \n transcription start site (TSS), and minor allele frequency.  We saw considerable \n performance for this task (AUC = 0.74, \n Fig. 2g  ),  improving over Enformer (AUC = 0.70, \n p=4.8e-04 for difference,  Supplementary Fig. S5  ).  We note that a series of \n improvements in eQTL scoring, including matching the predictions to the eQTL tissue of \n interest, and evaluating over the entire contiguous coding sequence rather than the \n transcription start site made signiﬁcant improvements to our performance for both \n models  (  Supplemental Note 1  ).  BigRNA’s classiﬁcation performance was similarly \n strong for variants more than 10 kilobases from their eGene’s TSS (AUC 0.73, versus \n 0.66 for Enformer, p=8.0e-05 for difference,  Supplementary Fig. S6  ). Together, these \n results indicate that BigRNA is able to help prioritize causal variants that mediate more \n common diseases, which has been challenging for sequence-based deep neural \n networks  18,19  . \n Predicting the effects of variants on splicing and intron retention \n An important subset of pathogenic variants affect splicing, such as those which cause \n skipping of an exon.  These variants often occur in coding regions, and may be \n incorrectly classiﬁed as benign mutations based on their amino acid substitutions, \n despite their pathogenic splicing effects  21  .  We evaluated BigRNA’s ability to classify the \n 5 \n 150 \n 151 \n 152 \n 153 \n 154 \n 155 \n 156 \n 157 \n 158 \n 159 \n 160 \n 161 \n 162 \n 163 \n 164 \n 165 \n 166 \n 167 \n 168 \n 169 \n 170 \n 171 \n 172 \n 173 \n 174 \n 175 \n 176 \n 177 \n 178 \n 179 \n 180 \n 181 \n 182 \n 183 \n 184 \n 185 \n 186 \n 187 \n 188 \n splicing impact of exonic variants that cause substantial (>50%) exon skipping, versus \n those that do not cause any splicing changes, using results from a massively parallel \n splicing assay  (MaPSy)  21  .  By predicting a change in junction coverage caused by these \n variants, BigRNA was able to accurately predict these skipping variants (AUC = 0.89 \n Fig. \n 3a  ), and showed better performance compared to a previously published method, \n SpliceAI  22  on this task (AUC=0.80, p<1e-05 for difference,  Supplementary Fig. S7  ).  We \n further investigated a pathogenic variant that causes skipping of exon 6 in the  ACADM \n gene, leading to a potentially fatal medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase \n deﬁciency  23,24  .  BigRNA predicted the exon skipping effects of this variant (FPR = 0.002, \n Fig. 3b  ), and that it causes this skipping by creating a binding site for the TDP-43 \n protein  23  , yielding insight into the mechanism-of-action.  We further investigated a VUS \n in  ATP7B  (c.3243+5G>A), a gene which clears copper from liver cells and causes Wilson \n disease when it is defective  25  .  This variant was predicted by BigRNA to cause in-frame \n skipping of  ATP7B  exon 14 (FPR=0.004,  Fig. 3c  ), which contains the ATP site and other \n critical elements  26  , thus causing a pathogenic loss-of-function.  We generated a \n homozygous HepG2 line and used RT-PCR to assay the effects of this variant and \n conﬁrm the exon skipping predicted by BigRNA ( \n Fig. 3c  ). \n Another class of pathogenic splicing variants are cryptic splicing mutations that cause \n full intron retention.  We evaluated BigRNA on its ability to predict a set of reported \n intron retention variants  27  , using nearby common variants as the negative set.  We \n observed strong performance on classifying these mutations (AUC=0.9, \n Fig. 3d  and \n Supplementary Fig. S8  ), so we next investigated whether BigRNA could predict more \n complex splicing aberrations.  We focused our attention on a pathogenic non-canonical \n splice site variant in the  ABCA4  gene (c.5714+5G>A), which had been found to induce \n Stargardt disease by causing skipping of  ABCA4  exon 40  28  .  This variant was strongly \n predicted to cause both the skipping of exon 40, and retention of intron 40 (FPR=0.008 \n and <0.04, respectively, \n Fig. 3e  ), but the latter had not been reported, likely due to \n technical limitations in the assay  28  .  To test this prediction, we edited a retinoblastoma \n cell line (WERI-Rb-1) to be homozygous for c.5714+5G>A, and performed RNA \n sequencing to capture the full suite of splicing events.  This conﬁrmed BigRNA’s \n predictions that this variant causes a complex set of aberrations that includes partial \n skipping of exon 40, as well as retention of intron 40. \n Designing splice-switching and expression-increase molecules \n The ability of BigRNA to understand regulatory mechanisms affecting splicing and gene \n expression may allow it to design therapeutic interventions that rescue pathogenic \n variant effects. For this application, we evaluated whether BigRNA could reverse \n 6 \n 189 \n 190 \n 191 \n 192 \n 193 \n 194 \n 195 \n 196 \n 197 \n 198 \n 199 \n 200 \n 201 \n 202 \n 203 \n 204 \n 205 \n 206 \n 207 \n 208 \n 209 \n 210 \n 211 \n 212 \n 213 \n 214 \n 215 \n 216 \n 217 \n 218 \n 219 \n 220 \n 221 \n 222 \n 223 \n 224 \n 225 \n 226 \n 227 \n splicing defects by designing steric blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) – short, \n chemically-modiﬁed synthetic nucleic acid strands purposed to bind speciﬁc RNA \n targets to modulate splicing and gene expression.  For example, Nusinersen, an FDA \n approved SBO, treats spinal muscular atrophy by reversing the skipping of exon 7 in \n SMN2  29  ,  thus restoring SMN protein levels and mitigating motor neuron loss and \n muscular atrophy. One way to predict the effect of an SBO is to hide the complementary \n binding site from the model’s input (  Methods)  .  This approach is an instance of \n ‘zero-shot learning’, because no additional task-speciﬁc SBO data is used when making \n the prediction. \n To evaluate the utility of zero-shot learning for virtual screening, we ﬁrst evaluated the \n ability of BigRNA to re-discover Nusinersen amongst the set of all possible SBOs within \n 200 base-pairs of  SMN2  exon 7.  Strikingly, BigRNA ranked Nusinersen within the top 3 \n of 437 compounds ( \n Fig. 4a  ). To more systematically evaluate the effectiveness of this \n approach, we treated 15 exons in 12 genes with a total of 620 SBOs, and observed a \n strong and statistically signiﬁcant correlation with the predicted and \n experimentally-measured exon inclusion levels in all cases (r=0.41-0.77, p=7e-12 to 2e-2, \n Fig. 4b  ). For comparison, SpliceAI correlated with experiments in 11/15 exons and the \n correlation was lower than BigRNA for 13/15 exons. \n We then used BigRNA to design a novel splice-switching SBO that rescues a pathogenic \n splicing defect.  Previously, we had reported that a missense variant in the  ATP7B  gene \n (c.1934T>G, Met645Arg) leads to Wilson disease by promoting skipping of exon 6, thus \n resulting in lowered levels of functional protein and subsequent copper accumulation in \n liver cells  25  .  We created a disease model of the Met645Arg variant in HepG2 cells, and \n used this system to test a set of SBOs targeting the skipped exon (  Methods  ).  We \n observed a strong relationship between the predicted and measured splicing changes \n (r=0.91, p=4.7e-22, \n Fig. 4c  ).  The top compound from this assay was predicted to be in \n the top 7 of 458 possible compounds by BigRNA. To summarize, BigRNA predicted both \n the exon skipping caused by Met645Arg (FPR=0.007) and the restorative effect of the \n top experimentally-validated compound ( \n Fig. 4d  ). \n BigRNA’s ability to score SBOs has utility in developing therapeutic candidates targeting \n extremely rare variants within a constrained budget.  First, we evaluated BigRNA’s ability \n to score SBOs that target a pseudo-exon in the  ATM  gene caused by the rare \n c.5763-1050A>G mutation, leading to ataxia-telangiectasia  30  .  We observed signiﬁcant \n correlation between the predictions and experimentally observed splicing eﬃciencies \n (r=0.64, p=3.3e-04,  Supplementary Fig. S9  ), and ranked the lead therapeutic candidate \n in the top 7 of 516 possible compounds.  We sought to explore whether similar \n 7 \n 228 \n 229 \n 230 \n 231 \n 232 \n 233 \n 234 \n 235 \n 236 \n 237 \n 238 \n 239 \n 240 \n 241 \n 242 \n 243 \n 244 \n 245 \n 246 \n 247 \n 248 \n 249 \n 250 \n 251 \n 252 \n 253 \n 254 \n 255 \n 256 \n 257 \n 258 \n 259 \n 260 \n 261 \n 262 \n 263 \n 264 \n 265 \n 266 \n therapeutic candidates could be developed for other rare splicing diseases.  After \n curating a set of extremely rare, so-called “N=1”, pathogenic variants from ClinVar \n (  Methods  ), we used BigRNA to predict which ones are likely to act through exon \n skipping while not affecting the core splice donor or acceptor site ( \n Fig. 4e  ), thus \n potentially being eligible for SBO remediation.  This included synonymous variants, \n non-synonymous variants predicted to be tolerated  31  , and variants near splice sites. \n One such variant was in intron 22 of  MYO1E,  which is associated with \n glomerulosclerosis  32  .  While no published mechanism exists for this variant, it was \n predicted to cause skipping of exon 23, and the top SBO was predicted to completely \n rescue this skipping defect, suggesting that this variant is amenable to personalized \n SBO treatment ( \n Fig. 4f  ). \n Owing to BigRNA’s striking ability to help design splice-switching SBOs, we turned to the \n more challenging problem of designing SBOs that amplify gene expression.  This \n requires the model to rank all possible compounds targeting any part of the transcript, \n again without any additional training and additionally with no prior knowledge of \n inhibitory regions.  Due to the greatly increased search space, we ﬁrst developed a \n method to score a large number of compounds in a computationally eﬃcient manner. \n For this, we applied a combination of established saliency mapping techniques  33,34  to \n evaluate the contribution of each base pair in a transcript on its expression in a given \n tissue, and took the minimum contribution score at the SBO binding region as the \n ‘inhibitory score’ of each compound (  Methods  ).  We again benchmarked this scoring on \n Nusinersen, reasoning that the skipping of exon 7 and subsequent nonsense-mediated \n mRNA decay is a major expression bottleneck. Considering all 26,901 SBOs of length \n 18  ,  Nusinersen ranked in the top 2.28% (  Supplementary Fig. S10  ), suggesting that \n BigRNA’s inhibitory scores can be used to identify inhibitory regions, and that this \n strategy could have recovered Nusinersen within a tractable screening budget. \n We then sought to systematically assess how well BigRNA could be used to discover \n novel therapeutically beneﬁcial expression-increasing SBOs. An example is \n Paraoxonase 1 (  PON1  ), where variants that decrease expression of the gene or catalytic \n activity of the protein have been associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic \n cardiovascular disease  35,36  (ASCVD).  In murine models, modulation of  PON1  expression \n has been shown to directionally inﬂuence the risk of ASCVD and related phenotypes  37–40  , \n thus presenting a compelling opportunity for expression-increasing therapeutics. We \n used BigRNA to perform large-scale SBO design, experimentally tested the predicted \n SBOs in primary human hepatocytes, and identiﬁed 10 compounds that showed activity \n for increasing  PON1  expression (  Methods  ).  By using a liver-speciﬁc score to rank all \n positive compounds, BigRNA showed a strong ability to prioritize expression increase \n 8 \n 267 \n 268 \n 269 \n 270 \n 271 \n 272 \n 273 \n 274 \n 275 \n 276 \n 277 \n 278 \n 279 \n 280 \n 281 \n 282 \n 283 \n 284 \n 285 \n 286 \n 287 \n 288 \n 289 \n 290 \n 291 \n 292 \n 293 \n 294 \n 295 \n 296 \n 297 \n 298 \n 299 \n 300 \n 301 \n 302 \n 303 \n 304 \n 305 \n compounds (AUC=0.818,  Fig. 4h  ). To expand this study, we screened \n expression-increasing compounds for  ATP7B  (to beneﬁt a broader population beyond \n Met645Arg)  ,  as well as  PRRT2  and  SERPING1  , which may confer therapeutic beneﬁts for \n benign familial infantile epilepsy  41  and  hereditary angioedema  42  .  For all three genes, \n BigRNA’s predictions successfully prioritized expression-increasing SBOs without \n requiring any additional training  (AUC=0.72-0.85, \n Fig. 4h  ). \n Discussion \n The rapid evolution of computational models in genomics has enabled the use of \n methods that can learn from large-scale genomics data to predict RNA expression from \n DNA sequence. Using deep learning to model RNA-seq data and take into account \n individual genomic sequence variation, we can enable novel and accelerated discovery \n on several drug discovery tasks. \n When we adapted previously published deep learning systems to the drug discovery \n tasks that we evaluated, we found that BigRNA performed substantially better overall. It \n improved signiﬁcantly over specialized models like TargetScan  8  and DeepRiPe  7  for \n predicting microRNA and RBP binding sites, and was more accurate than SpliceAI  22  at \n identifying exon skipping variants as well as designing splice-switching SBOs.  BigRNA \n could accurately predict pathogenic variants in untranslated regions, matching \n specialized models for the 5’ and 3’ UTRs  15,16  , and improved upon the general-purpose \n Enformer model  2  .  In cases where BigRNA’s performance matched an existing model, \n direct modeling of RNA-seq data had distinct advantages.  For example, unlike a \n previously described ribosomal loading model  15  , BigRNA could predict all classes of \n pathogenic mutations in the 5’ UTR, and unlike a model of RNA half life  16  , it could predict \n that a pathogenic variant acts by changing the polyadenylation site, which reduces the \n half-life.  Existing methods for predicting splice donor and acceptor strength  22  are \n unable to identify correlated splicing events, such as intron retention, but we found that \n BigRNA is able to do so.  For complex traits, in contrast to traditional ﬁne-mapping \n methods that do not provide insight into the mechanistic impact of causal mutations  43  , \n BigRNA can make predictions for complex trait heritability contributions from many \n different mechanisms that do not exert their effect through a change in protein \n structure. \n The ability of BigRNA to learn mechanisms of RNA regulation is reﬂected by the fact \n that it was able to accurately design SBOs that counteract the effects of pathogenic \n variants or that increase gene expression, without being provided with a single training \n case of an SBO and its effect. Nonetheless, a further avenue of work would include \n 9 \n 306 \n 307 \n 308 \n 309 \n 310 \n 311 \n 312 \n 313 \n 314 \n 315 \n 316 \n 317 \n 318 \n 319 \n 320 \n 321 \n 322 \n 323 \n 324 \n 325 \n 326 \n 327 \n 328 \n 329 \n 330 \n 331 \n 332 \n 333 \n 334 \n 335 \n 336 \n 337 \n 338 \n 339 \n 340 \n 341 \n 342 \n ﬁne-tuning BigRNA by learning from SBO treatment data, such as from the rich \n information encoded by SBO-treated RNA-seq samples  44  .  Similar approaches can be \n used for other therapeutic modalities such as predicting the phenotypic effects of \n induced ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) editing so that they confer a \n similar compensatory effect on splicing or expression  45  , or designing mRNAs that have \n increased half-life and translation eﬃciency. \n Several avenues exist to improve the predictive abilities of BigRNA.  The 128bp \n resolution of the model can be improved with additional training resources  2  . \n Improvements in the speed and scalability of the transformer architecture  46  , coupled \n with the use of parameterized upsampling  47  may allow the model to retain a high \n context size while producing predictions at single base-pair resolution.  Training on \n more individuals could improve generalization across genotypes. While the training \n procedure takes into account variation from 70 individuals, WGS-paired RNA-seq data is \n available for many more GTEx samples, and can be supplemented with additional \n datasets  48  .  To take into account such a large amount of data, methods have been \n developed to prioritize the most informative training points  49  , allowing the training \n procedure to scale and effectively learn from extremely large datasets.  To explore \n improved prediction of differences between individuals, a contrastive training objective \n can be used  50,51,52  and predictions can be made for the difference in expression between \n two haplotypes  53  . \n Our results show that different drug discovery tasks can be assisted by deep learning. \n We believe that BigRNA and deep learning systems like it have the potential to \n transform the ﬁeld of RNA therapeutics. \n 10 \n 343 \n 344 \n 345 \n 346 \n 347 \n 348 \n 349 \n 350 \n 351 \n 352 \n 353 \n 354 \n 355 \n 356 \n 357 \n 358 \n 359 \n 360 \n 361 \n 362 \n 363 \n 364 \n 365 \n 366 \n 367 \n Methods \n RNA-seq model training \n We downloaded and aligned RNA-seq data from the GTEx consortium  5  V6 release, \n processing all available data from the set of 70 individuals with the most tissue \n availability (data from a total of 51 tissues are available, but data availability varies \n between individuals).  Data was processed using an in-house pipeline (Supplementary \n Information 1.2).  Each RNA-seq sample was processed into two data tracks: coverage \n and junction, where the junction track contains a subset of read counts at splice \n junctions.  To make the data compatible with the 128bp resolution of the model’s \n architecture  2  , we applied 128bp-window average-pooling on coverage tracks, and \n 128bp-window sum-pooling on junction tracks.  To incorporate genomic variants from \n each individual, we re-aligned the RNA-seq data to match the insertions and deletions \n introduced by each individual’s haplotype (Supplementary Information 1.2). BigRNA was \n trained with a separate output for each sample, so that each output can be \n independently learned. We trained BigRNA by minimizing differences between \n prediction from both haplotypes and the observed coverage and junction tracks from \n RNA-seq (Supplementary Information 1.3, Supplementary Equation S2). In addition to \n the individual-speciﬁc outputs, we also added individual-agnostic per-tissue outputs to \n encourage the model to learn a mapping from genotype to expected expression (where \n the expectation is taken across all individuals). Description of all output heads can be \n found in Supplementary Data 1.  Fig. 1a shows the training pipeline. The same \n procedure was used to train an ensemble of 7 models, varying learning rate, degree of \n gradient clipping, and the pre-training strategy for each model in the ensemble \n (Supplementary Information 1.3, Supplementary Table S1). At inference time, to predict \n on a genomic interval, we used shifted intervals to increase the prediction resolution to \n 64 base pairs, and averaged predictions from both strands (Supplementary Information \n 1.4, Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Fig. S2). \n Fine-tuning on RBP and microRNA datƒasets \n After training models on RNA-seq dataset, we further ﬁne-tuned models on RBP and \n microRNA datasets. The RBP dataset was constructed by downloading eCLIP data  6 \n from ENCODE  54  (Supplementary Information 1.2.2). The microRNA dataset was \n generated by processing CLIP-Seq data from 12 cell lines (Supplementary Information \n 1.2.3). We ﬁne-tuned the model by ﬁrst updating weights of the last layer for 10 epochs, \n then updating weights of the entire model for another 30 epochs (Supplementary \n Information 1.3). Description of all output heads can be found in Supplementary Data 2. \n 11 \n 368 \n 369 \n 370 \n 371 \n 372 \n 373 \n 374 \n 375 \n 376 \n 377 \n 378 \n 379 \n 380 \n 381 \n 382 \n 383 \n 384 \n 385 \n 386 \n 387 \n 388 \n 389 \n 390 \n 391 \n 392 \n 393 \n 394 \n 395 \n 396 \n 397 \n 398 \n 399 \n 400 \n 401 \n 402 \n 403 \n 404 \n 405 \n Held-out performance on gene expression and differential gene expression \n We selected protein coding genes that are completely outside the training and validation \n set, and which overlap at least one interval in the test set. Predictions and targets were \n mean-aggregated over all exons for each gene to yield one value per gene \n (Supplementary Information 2.1). For each tissue, we compute the correlation between \n prediction and target across all genes.  To evaluate performance on differential gene \n expression, we constructed all pairwise comparisons between tissues, and computed \n the log  2  fold-change using the predicted and target coverage data (Supplementary \n Information 2.2). For each tissue pair we computed the correlation between the \n predicted and target log  2  fold-changes across all genes. \n Visualizing prediction on SLC7A8 \n Sequence of SLC7A8 gene was obtained from hg38 genome build with Gencode v29 \n annotation. We averaged output heads that correspond to coverage in the “Brain - \n Hypothalamus” tissue to obtain BigRNA prediction for visualization (Supplementary \n Information 2.3). \n Held-out performance on RBP \n Processed RBP peaks were  obtained from ENCODE  54  , and processed into low \n resolution binary labels by taking into account noise in the data [Supplementary \n Information 1.2.2, Supplementary Equation S8]. We selected protein coding genes that \n are completely outside the training and validation set, and made predictions using \n BigRNA and DeepRiPe  7  . Both BigRNA and DeepRiPe predictions were averaged within \n each 128-bp window (Supplementary Information 2.4). Fig. 1g shows the average \n precision performance of BigRNA and DeepRiPe. \n Held-out performance on microRNA \n The microRNA dataset was generated by processing CLIP-Seq data from 12 cell lines \n (Supplementary Information 1.2.3). The called peaks were further processed into low \n resolution binary labels by taking into account noise in the data (Supplementary \n Equation S9). We selected protein coding genes that are completely outside the training \n and validation set, and made predictions using BigRNA and TargetScan  8  . Both BigRNA \n and TargetScan predictions were averaged within each 128-bp window (Supplementary \n Information 2.5). Fig 1h shows the au-ROC performance of BigRNA and TargetScan. \n Benchmarking variant effect predictions on pathogenic variants \n Pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) UTR SNVs were obtained from Bohn et al  13  . \n Putative benign SNVs located in the same UTR were obtained from ClinVar, if they were \n classiﬁed as benign or likely benign (B/LB), and gnomAD v3 if their global allele \n 12 \n 406 \n 407 \n 408 \n 409 \n 410 \n 411 \n 412 \n 413 \n 414 \n 415 \n 416 \n 417 \n 418 \n 419 \n 420 \n 421 \n 422 \n 423 \n 424 \n 425 \n 426 \n 427 \n 428 \n 429 \n 430 \n 431 \n 432 \n 433 \n 434 \n 435 \n 436 \n 437 \n 438 \n 439 \n 440 \n 441 \n 442 \n 443 \n 444 \n frequency was greater than 0.001  55  (Supplementary Information 3.1.1). For the 5’ UTR \n benchmark, we predicted the effect of the variant using BigRNA, Enformer, and \n FramePool and took the absolute value of the variant effect scores. For the 3’ UTR \n benchmark, we evaluated BigRNA, Enformer, and Saluki and again, took the absolute \n values of the variant effect scores (Supplementary Information 3.1.2, Supplementary \n Equation S10-12). In addition to Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. S3 shows the ROC curve \n and PRC of classiﬁcation performance of all models. To compare models, we \n performed permutation tests with 10000 permutations (Supplementary Information \n 3.1.3). Variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS) in the UTRs of the genes that were in the \n benchmark were extracted as described in Supplementary Information 3.1.4. \n Predicting the impact of disrupting polyadenylation sites \n To evaluate BigRNA's ability to predict poly(A) sites, we conducted an in-silico 11 bp \n N-mask tiling analysis across each poly(A) region. Poly(A) sites (PAS) from 200 genes \n were obtained from PolyASite 2.0  56  (Supplementary Information 3.3). For each PAS, we \n expanded the site by ±100 bp to cover proximal regulatory elements, resulting in 206 bp \n regions. We subsequently N-masked 11 bp tiles across the region and compared \n BigRNA predictions for the N-masked sequences (mutant) and the poly(A) signal \n sequence (wildtype). The BigRNA predictions were based on the mean of the individual \n sample RNA-seq coverage heads across all tissue types (Supplementary Information \n 3.3). For the  NAA10  PAS and its surrounding 100 bp context, we performed saturation \n mutagenesis by point-mutating every reference nucleic acid base to every other nucleic \n acid base. Similar to the poly(A) site analysis, we carried out predictions using the \n BigRNA model to assess the impact of these mutations on gene expression. \n Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimation for \n PON1  variants \n The four variants with known expression effect were rs705379 (chr7:95324583:G:A), \n rs854571 (chr7:95325307:T:C), rs854572 (chr7:95325384:C:G) and rs3735590 \n (chr7:95298183:G:A).  The eQTL and normalized effect size of these variants on  PON1 \n liver tissue expression were obtained from the GTEx eQTL Calculator .  The LD R  2  values \n between variants was calculated using the NIH LDmatrix tool with the GBR population \n selected. \n Classifying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) versus matched controls \n To construct a benchmark dataset from conﬁdently ﬁne-mapped eQTLs, variants with a \n posterior inclusion probability of 0.5 or greater (indicating that they are the most likely \n causal variant in the credible set) were selected from eQTLGen statistical ﬁne-mapping \n of expression modulating variants in GTEx v8  19  . eQTLs within 50kbp of the transcription \n 13 \n 445 \n 446 \n 447 \n 448 \n 449 \n 450 \n 451 \n 452 \n 453 \n 454 \n 455 \n 456 \n 457 \n 458 \n 459 \n 460 \n 461 \n 462 \n 463 \n 464 \n 465 \n 466 \n 467 \n 468 \n 469 \n 470 \n 471 \n 472 \n 473 \n 474 \n 475 \n 476 \n 477 \n 478 \n 479 \n 480 \n 481 \n 482 \n 483 \n start site of the primary or most highly expressed transcript for the reported eGene were \n selected to ensure that deep learning models would have suﬃcient genomic context to \n accurately predict changes in expression. For each eQTL we selected a matched \n negative control variant from the same effector gene (eGene) which was not associated \n with its expression (P > 0.05) in any tissue and within 10% of the eQTL ’s minor allele \n frequency and 10kbp of the eQTL ’s genomic position. This resulted in a dataset of 1374 \n eQTL variants and 1162 matched negative controls. \n Classifying variants that cause intron retention \n Variants that cause full intron retention were manually curated from splicing variants \n downloaded from the SPCards database  27  . A matching set of variants that do not cause \n intron retention were processed from  gnomAD  55  (Supplementary Information 4.1.1). For \n each variant, we use BigRNA to predict the relative coverage between intron and the two \n ﬂanking exons, and compute the score as the ratio between wild-type and mutant-type, \n aggregated across models in ensemble (Supplementary Information 4.1.2, \n Supplementary Equation S14-16). \n Classifying variants that cause exon skipping \n For each mutation in the MaPSy dataset  21  , we computed the splicing odds ratio and \n conﬁdence interval using the reported readout from both in-vitro and in-vivo assays, to \n create a high conﬁdence binary label on skipping versus non-skipping at splicing levels \n ranging from 50% to 10% (Supplementary Information 4.2.1, Supplementary Equation \n S17-18). For each mutation, we used BigRNA to predict the difference in junction counts \n between wild-type and mutant-type, normalized by exon, and aggregate across models \n in ensemble (Supplementary Information 4.2.2, Supplementary Equation S19).  Fig 3a \n shows ROC curve of classiﬁcation performance on skipping versus non-skipping at 50% \n splicing level. For model comparison (Supplementary Fig. S7), we performed \n permutation tests with 100,000 permutations. \n Predicting the effect of splice-switching SBOs \n To obtain the relative ranking of Nusinersen, we ranked all possible SBOs of length 18 \n within 200 base pairs of exon 7 of SMN2 (Supplementary Information 5.1). We used \n RT-PCR to measure the Percentage Spliced In (PSI) values for 15 exons in the HEK293T \n cell line, and compared the measured PSI with the predicted SBO effect of SpliceAI and \n BigRNA using the Spearman Correlation metric (Supplementary Information 5.2).  We \n repeated the above evaluation for SBOs targeting Met645Arg; here we edited HepG2 \n cells to introduce the c.1934T>G Met645Arg variant, and screened a library of 55 SBOs \n by qPCR. Spearman correlation was computed between BigRNA predictions and the \n experimentally observed  ATP7B  expression levels (Supplementary Information 5.3). The \n 14 \n 484 \n 485 \n 486 \n 487 \n 488 \n 489 \n 490 \n 491 \n 492 \n 493 \n 494 \n 495 \n 496 \n 497 \n 498 \n 499 \n 500 \n 501 \n 502 \n 503 \n 504 \n 505 \n 506 \n 507 \n 508 \n 509 \n 510 \n 511 \n 512 \n 513 \n 514 \n 515 \n 516 \n 517 \n 518 \n 519 \n 520 \n 521 \n 522 \n same evaluation was carried out on published data of SBOs designed to skip a \n pseudo-exon created by the c.5763-1050A>G variant in ATM  30  . \n The set of “N=1” variants was created by selecting pathogenic or likely pathogenic \n variants (ClinVar) from genes that are exclusively associated with autosomal recessive \n disorders (OMIM).  BigRNA predictions were made for SNVs with very low estimated \n worldwide prevalence (n=1582, GnomAD) and we curated synonymous, tolerated \n missense (SIFT) and intronic variants (excluding the core dinucleotides) for their \n mechanisms of pathogenicity (Supplementary Information 5.5).  All possible 20-mers \n within 200 bp of  MYO1E  exon 23 were scored for their ability to remedy the effect of the \n c.2481-12A>G variant, and we visualized the predictions for the highest ranked SBO. \n Predicting the effect of expression increase SBOs \n Expression increase can occur through a variety of mechanisms, and SBOs can be \n designed anywhere in the gene. By applying a combination of established saliency \n mapping techniques  33,34  , we evaluated the contribution of each base pair in a transcript \n to the expression of the related gene in the relevant tissue, yielding a sensitivity score \n for each base pair's impact on gene expression levels, called the Inhibitory Score \n (Supplementary Information 1.5). This per-base-pair score was then used to rank SBOs \n by taking the minimum score of any overlapping base-pair (Supplementary Information \n 5.6.2).  For the Nusinersen ranking evaluation, we used the BigRNA Inhibitory Score to \n score all candidate SBOs of length 18 targeting the entirety of the gene body of SMN2. \n The same process was applied to expression increase SBOs identiﬁed from screens of \n PON1  ,  ATPB  ,  PRRT2  , and  SERPING1  . Scores between hit SBOs and the background of all \n candidate SBOs were compared with a Mann-Whitney U-Test. \n Data Availability \n Data and code to be made available upon peer review. \n References \n 1.
