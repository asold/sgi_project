  "abstract": "The rapid integration of Generative AI technologies in academic and research environments marks the beginning of a new digital era, characterized by enhanced efficiency and innovative capabilities. This technological advancement, however, brings forth significant challenges and ethical dilemmas. One of the primary concerns is the potential diminishment of authentic human intellect in scholarly works, fueled by the capabilities of AI to generate ambiguous, fabricated, or even biased and inappropriate content. These issues highlight the critical need for developing comprehensive frameworks and establishing a dedicated field of study to govern the use of AI-generated content in academic and professional contexts. This autoethnography explores the impact of generative AI on educational practices, detailing the development of the SPARRO framework in healthcare and nursing classes. Through personal reflections, interviews, and observations, it addresses specific challenges, offering insights into integrating GenAI ethically and effectively to enhance teaching and learning.",
