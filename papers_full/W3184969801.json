  "abstract": "Background A digital tool, Multiple Sclerosis Progression Discussion Tool (MSProDiscuss), was developed to facilitate discussions between health care professionals (HCPs) and patients in evaluating early, subtle signs of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease progression. Objective The aim of this study is to report the findings on the usability and usefulness of MSProDiscuss in a real-world clinical setting. Methods In this cross-sectional, web-based survey, HCPs across 34 countries completed an initial individual questionnaire (comprising 7 questions on comprehensibility, usability, and usefulness after using MSProDiscuss during each patient consultation) and a final questionnaire (comprising 13 questions on comprehensibility, usability, usefulness, and integration and adoption into clinical practice to capture the HCPs’ overall experience of using the tool). The responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale. All analyses were descriptive, and no statistical comparisons were made. Results In total, 301 HCPs tested the tool in 6974 people with MS, of whom 77% (5370/6974) had relapsing-remitting MS, including those suspected to be transitioning to secondary progressive MS. The time taken to complete MSProDiscuss was reported to be in the range of 1 to 4 minutes in 97.3% (6786/6974; initial) to 98.2% (269/274; final) of the cases. In 93.54% (6524/6974; initial) to 97.1% (266/274; final) of the cases, the HCPs agreed (4 or 5 on the Likert scale) that patients were able to comprehend the questions in the tool. The HCPs were willing to use the tool again in the same patient, 90.47% (6310/6974; initial) of the cases. The HCPs reported MSProDiscuss to be useful in discussing MS symptoms and their impact on daily activities (6121/6974, 87.76% initial and 252/274, 92% final) and cognitive function (5482/6974, 78.61% initial and 271/274, 79.2% final), as well as in discussing progression in general (6102/6974, 87.49% initial and 246/274, 89.8% final). While completing the final questionnaire, 94.9% (260/274) of the HCPs agreed that the questions were similar to those asked in regular consultation, and the tool helped to better understand the impact of MS symptoms on daily activities (249/274, 90.9%) and cognitive function (220/274, 80.3%). Overall, 92% (252/274) of the HCPs reported that they would recommend MSProDiscuss to a colleague, and 85.8% (235/274) were willing to integrate it into their clinical practice. Conclusions MSProDiscuss is a usable and useful tool to facilitate a physician-patient discussion on MS disease progression in daily clinical practice. Most of the HCPs agreed that the tool is easy to use and were willing to integrate MSProDiscuss into their daily clinical practice.",

It is challenging to\ndefine this transition from RRMS to SPMS because of the lack\nof a clear consensus on the diagnostic criteria and the absence\nof reliable biomarkers of disease progression [4]. This delay in\nSPMS diagnosis may affect long-term prognosis and treatment\ndecision-making [5]. Previous research has confirmed an unmet\nneed for a tool to facilitate systematic assessment of the early\nsigns of progression to SPMS in routine clinical practice [6].\nThe Multiple Sclerosis Progression Discussion Tool\n(MSProDiscuss) is a digital tool for use by health care\nprofessionals (HCPs) in clinical practice to raise awareness of\nthe risk of progression from RRMS to SPMS through a\nstructured interaction between HCPs and patients.\nMSProDiscuss aims to help physicians, in dialog with patients,\nto evaluate early, subtle signs suggestive of MS disease\nprogression [7]. The tool is based on a set of weighted questions\nthat collect structured information on disease activity (relapses\nor magnetic resonance imaging activity), symptoms, and impact\nof the patient’s overall symptoms on daily living in the previous\n6 months. The tool is completed by the physician during a\nroutine physician-patient interaction. On completion, the tool\ngenerates a traffic light output that represents the probability of\nprogression. Green indicates patients who are unlikely to be\nshowing signs of progression, yellow suggests that such signs\nmay be present, and red identifies patients who are very likely\nshowing signs of progression. MSProDiscuss was developed\nin several phases using a rigorous mixed methods approach.\nThis approach included quantitative analysis of data from a\nlarge observational study in patients diagnosed with RRMS and\nSPMS and qualitative research with MS neurologists and\npatients with MS. The development of MSProDiscuss involved\nan iterative feedback process and validation stages [6-8]. The\nfeedback received from patients and physicians was integrated\ninto the next iteration throughout the development phases of\nMSProDiscuss. The final tool was pilot tested in a separate\nvalidation study with clinicians (N=20, from the United States,\nGermany, and Canada) in a real-world setting, and it\ndemonstrated high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate\nbetween patients with RRMS and those with SPMS. The tool\nalso demonstrated evidence of construct validity, suggesting\nthat the items included are relevant in assessing early signs of\nprogression, and the HCPs supported the implementation and\nusefulness of the tool for clinical practice [8,9]. MSProDiscuss\nis part of several noninterventional longitudinal studies to further\nassess changes in the level of progression over the long term\n[10,11]. MSProDiscuss has been released for use in clinical\npractice, and the final validated tool can be accessed on the web\n[12] and on the Neuro-Compass medical education resource\nwebsite [13].\nObjective\nWe conducted a separate usability testing study to assess the\nperformance of MSProDiscuss on a larger scale, involving HCPs\nfrom different geographies and health care systems, with the\naims to further test the (1) usability of tool in daily clinical\npractice, and comprehensibility of items included: (2) usefulness\nof the tool to assist patient-physician discussion on MS disease\nprogression, (3) feasibility, ease, and willingness of HCPs to\nintegrate MSProDiscuss into their routine clinical practice, and\n(4) insights gathered from HCPs on areas of improvement on\nthe tool’s usefulness. In this paper, we report the findings from\nphysicians on the usability and usefulness of MSProDiscuss\nwhile discussing disease progression with patients in a\nreal-world setting.\nJ Med Internet Res 2021 | vol. 23 | iss. 10 | e29558 | p. 2https://www.jmir.org/2021/10/e29558\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nZiemssen et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThis was a multinational, cross-sectional, and noninterventional\nstudy surveying HCPs, including MS specialists, general\nneurologists, or others as indicated by the self-identification\nchoices provided to the participants. The HCPs responsible for\nthe diagnosis, management, and care, or those in charge of\nsymptom evaluation and control, of at least five patients with\nMS per week in their daily clinical practice were included in\nthe survey. The HCPs were invited by local representatives of\nthe study sponsor, Novartis, to participate in a web-based survey\nconducted between July 2019 and December 2019 in 34\ncountries across North America, Europe, Asia, South America,\nAfrica, and Australia. No ethics approval was required because\nthis was a survey. Nevertheless, all respondents were offered\ndetailed information about the survey method, and they provided\nwritten consent before participating.\nSurvey Methodology\nThe survey was carried out by Real World Evidence Solutions\n(IQVIA AG). A web-based survey link was sent to the HCPs\nwho consented to participate in the study. The survey consisted\nof 2 questionnaires to gather feedback on the understanding,\nusefulness, usability, integration, and adoption of MSProDiscuss\nin daily clinical practice. The questionnaires were developed\nbased on feedback from HCPs during the tool development\nphase and according to the principles of implementation science,\nand inputs provided by the sponsor’s medical team and by\nresearchers from Real World Evidence Solutions were included.\nThe initial translations of the questionnaires were provided by\nIQVIA, which were further evaluated and modified as necessary\nby the local Novartis medical teams. The HCPs used\nMSProDiscuss to assess what they felt was a broad range of\npeople with MS, excluding those with clinically isolated\nsyndrome and primary progressive MS. The survey methodology\nis illustrated in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Steps of the MSProDiscuss usability test survey. HCP: health care professional; MSProDiscuss: Multiple Sclerosis Progression Discussion\nTool.\nEach HCP was asked to fill two types of questionnaires\n(Multimedia Appendix 1), with their responses collected on a\n5-point Likert scale. The HCPs filled an initial questionnaire\nafter each instance of using MSProDiscuss during a face-to-face\nindividual patient consultation. This initial questionnaire\nincluded 7 questions to collect feedback on the time needed to\ncomplete MSProDiscuss during a routine clinical visit,\ncomprehensibility of the questions in the tool, and the overall\nusability and usefulness of MSProDiscuss in facilitating a\ndiscussion on disease progression between HCPs and patients\nin routine practice. Each HCP was expected to fill 10-40 initial\nquestionnaires, depending on the patient population or country\nsize. After completing all individual questionnaires, the HCPs\nalso completed a final questionnaire on their overall assessment\nof MSProDiscuss, taking into account all previous consultations.\nThe final questionnaire included 13 questions. In addition to\nthose items covered in the initial questionnaire, we gathered\nfeedback on the integration of MSProDiscuss into clinical\npractice. This two-step process was intended to ensure that the\nfinal feedback on usability and usefulness was received only\nafter the HCPs had sufficient experience with the tool itself.\nThe HCPs were also requested to provide general feedback on\nthe features and performance of the tool in free-text fields.\nSummary Statistics\nThe HCP responses to the 2 usability questionnaires were\nanalyzed separately with regard to the individual and final\nquestionnaires and descriptively on a question-by-question basis\nand reported as a proportion of the total responses. The\ndifferences in the responses to the questionnaires by country\nwere summarized by region and visualized as a heat map. No\nstatistical comparisons were performed. To ensure that the\nsurvey sample was representative of the true population, both\nweighted and unweighted percentages were calculated. The\nweighted analysis ensured that the results were adjusted to\nreflect the underlying sample distribution. Therefore, weighting\nwas performed at the country level with regard to the survey\nsample size. For the individual questionnaire, this refers to the\nnumber of patients for whom MSProDiscuss was used, whereas\nfor the final questionnaire, the number of HCPs who participated\nin the survey was relevant (Multimedia Appendix 2). The\nfeedback provided as free text was analyzed qualitatively by\nidentifying common themes and categorizing them accordingly.\nJ Med Internet Res 2021 | vol. 23 | iss. 10 | e29558 | p. 3https://www.jmir.org/2021/10/e29558\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nZiemssen et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nResults\nSurvey Participant Characteristics\nOf the 390 HCPs who were invited, 301 provided feedback on\nat least one questionnaire. Most of the participants were MS\nspecialists (246/301, 81.7%), but also included general\nneurologists, MS nurses and nurse practitioners, and physician\nassistants (Figure 2). In a subanalysis of the participating HCPs\nfrom 5 countries in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and\nthe United Kingdom, which together represented 24.9% (75/301)\nof the participating HCPs), 52% (36/75) of the HCPs were from\na hospital-based practice setting (Figure 2).

A meaningful impact of this approach may be seen\nin the overall positive experience expressed by the HCPs while\nusing MSProDiscuss. Of the 301 HCPs who returned the final\nquestionnaire, 162 made at least one recommendation on\nimprovements, such as including additional variables or\nexpanding the existing variables. Table 2 lists these suggestions\nby topic and implementation status. Even before the conclusion\nof the survey on usability, implementation was already ongoing\nfor several recommendations, including (1) integration of\nMSProDiscuss into electronic health record systems to allow\nfor longitudinal patient follow-up in countries such as the United\nStates, United Kingdom, and Germany; (2) an enhanced user\ninterface for easier navigation; (3) improvement of the\nsensitivity of the tool for patients with lower Expanded\nDisability Status Scale (EDSS) scores or confounding symptoms\nsuch as fatigue; and, most importantly, (4) development of a\npatient version of the tool.

In 2014, the\nstudy by Lublin et al [15] reported revised clinical and imaging\nfindings to define clinical phenotypes. However, the study also\nacknowledged that objective criteria for separating clinical\nphenotypes are still lacking. There are no clear definitions of\nthe transition from RRMS to SPMS. Until recently, no therapy\nwith proven efficacy was available for a broad range of patients\nwith SPMS. Thus, the diagnosis of SPMS is often delayed to\navoid losing treatment options and reimbursement. With the\nadvent of newer treatments for patients with SPMS, tools such\nas MSProDiscuss could be useful in supporting real-time\nevaluation of early signs of MS progression in routine clinical\npractice [16]. Tools based on algorithms and nomograms have\nbeen developed that use quantitative, data-driven empirical\nassessments. Although these tools can estimate the future risk\nof SPMS progression, they cannot easily be translated into\ncurrent decisions in routine patient management [17-19].\nMSProDiscuss provides additional insight through qualitative\nassessment of disease symptoms and their impact on daily life,\nthereby including, for the first time, the patient’s perspective\nin the overall shared decision-making. Timely diagnosis will\nallow for appropriate treatment and better long-term prognosis\n[14].\nPrincipal Findings\nThe results of this survey indicate that MSProDiscuss is a useful\ntool to aid the discussion of disease progression with patients.\nThe findings were consistent between the individual and final\nquestionnaires. Most of the HCPs agreed or strongly agreed\nthat MSProDiscuss was beneficial in their practice. The time\ntaken to complete the tool during routine consultation was\nconsidered satisfactory (1-4 minutes). In most instances, the\nquestions in MSProDiscuss were found to be comprehensible\nby the patients and were similar to those asked by an HCP\nduring a regular consultation. Thus, MSProDiscuss facilitates\npatient-physician discussion by capturing a structured disease\nhistory without imposing an additional time burden on the HCP.\nFurthermore, these positive results indicate that MSProDiscuss\nis easy to use and universally helpful, regardless of region,\nprofessional background, and practice setting.\nMore than 90.48% (6310/6974) of instances the HCPs indicated\nthat they would use MSProDiscuss again with the same patients,\nincluding both patients with RRMS (4985/6310, 79%) and\npatients with SPMS (1325/6310, 20.99%). In particular, the\nHCPs indicated that they would use the tool again with more\nJ Med Internet Res 2021 | vol. 23 | iss. 10 | e29558 | p. 8https://www.jmir.org/2021/10/e29558\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nZiemssen et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nthan 97% (5209/5370) of the patients with RRMS and with\n94.01% (1508/1604) of the patients with SPMS. This indicates\na potential role of MSProDiscuss as a complementary\ndisease-monitoring tool for longitudinal follow-up to be added\nto current empirical measures such as clinical relapses or\nmagnetic resonance imaging lesion counts. Qualitative insight\ninto the symptoms and their impact on patients as captured by\nMSProDiscuss will help identify early signs of disease\nprogression. In patients with RRMS, the tool might complement\nclinical assessments and help in treatment decision-making\nduring the earliest stages of SPMS. For patients already\ndiagnosed with SPMS, the tool will be helpful in identifying\nfunctional domains that are most affected by progression and\nin choosing the appropriate modalities for symptom\nmanagement.\nIn this survey, 80.3% (220/274) or more of the HCPs indicated\nthat MSProDiscuss is a useful aid in discussing MS symptoms\nand their impact on daily activities and cognitive function, as\nwell as in discussing progression in general. The fact that 91.9%\n(252/274) of the HCPs would recommend MSProDiscuss to\ntheir colleagues and think that it is feasible to integrate\nMSProDiscuss into their clinical practice is very encouraging\nbecause it suggests that the tool is beneficial to patients as well\nas HCPs themselves. Key recommendations have already been\nimplemented, including longitudinal follow-up, an enhanced\nuser interface, improved sensitivity at lower EDSS scores,\ncorrection for overlapping fatigue symptoms, and creation of a\npatient-completed version. The suggestion to expand cognitive\nassessments is a key point; cognitive impairment is an important\nyet underrecognized sign of disease progression [20,21]. How\nempirical measures of cognitive performance could be integrated\ninto this tool, without affecting the overall performance of the\ntool in terms of the time taken and ease of use during regular\nconsultations, is an important goal for future development.\nSimilarly, whether objective patient-reported outcomes measures\ncould be integrated into MSProDiscuss remains to be evaluated.\nAlong with the traffic light output, considering the patient’s\nresponses to the individual questions provides additional\ninsights, supporting the relevance of MSProDiscuss for holistic\ndisease management in individual patients. MSProDiscuss is\nsuitable for longitudinal follow-up and has already been included\nin large observational studies [22] and integrated into the\nelectronic health records in several countries. This will ensure\nthe systematic recording of a patient’s disease evolution and\nindividual patient monitoring over time. The tool will assist in\ndefining a multidisciplinary treatment strategy for individual\npatients, including physiotherapy, rehabilitation, and relevant\nsymptomatic treatments. As MSProDiscuss covers several\nfunctional domains, it provides comprehensive information on\nthe patient’s health status, including MS phenotype and\nsymptomatology [23]. Although EDSS assessment is viewed\nas the gold standard for measuring physical disability, it has\nbeen implemented in clinical routine on a limited scale [24-26].\nMSProDiscuss will complement EDSS assessment in routine\npractice by capturing symptoms and their impact between\nconsecutive EDSS assessments.\nA patient version of the tool, the Your MS questionnaire, was\ndeveloped to cover patient-derived information on MS\nsymptoms also contained in MSProDiscuss (Multimedia\nAppendix 6). The Your MS questionnaire can be completed by\nthe patient in preparation for a clinical visit, potentially with\nhelp from a caregiver who can provide additional information\n[27]. The Your MS questionnaire may further complement\npatient-physician interactions on disease progression and is\nexpected to not only help reduce the on-call burden on\nphysicians without compromising on the quality of consultation,\nbut also positively involve patients in the management of their\nown disease. The use of telemedicine is an increasing trend in\nthe management of chronic diseases [28,29]; most recently, the\nimplementation of telemedicine in the management of visits by\npatients with MS has been accelerated by the COVID-19\npandemic [30,31]. In the context of teleconsultation, the Digital\nTechnologies Web and Social Media Study Group recently\nsuggested a battery for assessing MS disability and relapse,\nproposing commonly used tools that are suitable before, during,\nand after a teleconsultation [32]. Being a web-based tool,\nMSProDiscuss was tested during the COVID-19 pandemic, and\nit showed promise in assisting with remote visits where the lack\nof face-to-face interaction can hamper communication. As one\nof the first tools of its kind, MSProDiscuss is able to assist with\ndeep clinical phenotyping of signs of progression, based on the\nphysician’s documented patient history [33]. As a tool with\npromise, the patient-completed Your MS questionnaire can\neither be used ahead of traditional face-to-face visits, or it may\nbe integrated into the suggested battery in preparation for a\nteleconsultation. Although implementation of these digital or\nweb-based tools in the management of MS is a necessity during\nthe pandemic, these tools are unlikely to fully replace\nface-to-face consultations [30]. In-person evaluation and\ndifferential diagnosis of MS symptoms remain vital, and\nespecially in light of technological and psychological limitations,\nweb-based tools will remain complementary to in-person\nconsultations [34].\nOverall, the results were consistent at the individual country\nand region levels, with some minor variations reflective of either\nindividual HCP preference of disease management or general\npractice guidelines followed in the country. The overall positive\nfeedback from most of the countries and regions suggests that\nMSProDiscuss is already perceived as a valuable tool. In some\ncountries such as Belgium where the feedback was less\nencouraging in terms of integration into clinical practice, a root\ncause analysis could not be performed because of the limitations\nof the study design. It can be speculated that, with limited\ntreatment options in some geographies, it is likely that there is\ncaution regarding discussing disease progression when no\nsolution can be proposed. In other cases, there may be reluctance\nto discuss disease progression because of the potential emotional\nand psychological implications for the patient. It is likely that\nthese factors could have influenced the respondents in our\nsurvey. However, this only re-emphasizes the need for clear\nand transparent discussions regarding the importance of\nidentifying early signs of disease progression, allowing\ntreatments and holistic modalities to be started sooner.\nStudy Limitations\nGathering feedback on the usability and usefulness of the tool\nwhile simultaneously using the tool might have resulted in a\nJ Med Internet Res 2021 | vol. 23 | iss. 10 | e29558 | p. 9https://www.jmir.org/2021/10/e29558\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nZiemssen et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\npotential bias in the HCPs’ responses to certain components of\nthe survey, such as integration into practice and time taken for\ncompletion. In general, the questionnaire methodology only\nhighlights trends or attitudes and does not explain the underlying\nreasons for the responses [35].\nOutlook\nOverall, the positive findings from our usability and usefulness\nstudy of MSProDiscuss are very promising [36]. Although\ncenters with a heavy patient inflow might find it difficult to\nimplement a new tool in their workflow, our results show that\nHCPs across different practice settings can easily integrate\nMSProDiscuss into their routine practice. MSProDiscuss does\nnot require extensive data to be collected or curated to assess\nthe level of disease progression, and it is complementary to\nother approaches based on imaging, neurological examination,\nor biomarkers. As a valuable disease-monitoring tool,\nadvantages in the long term should outweigh the initial\nimplementation challenges, if any. When used together with\nYour MS, the patient version, MSProDiscuss can also be a\nvaluable tool in the day-to-day management of people with MS\nthrough telemedicine, even during crisis situations. The future\nimpact on long-term disease monitoring and health care resource\nutilization remains to be evaluated.\nConclusions\nThe findings from this real-world study suggest that\nMSProDiscuss is a usable and useful tool to facilitate a\nphysician-patient discussion on disease progression in daily\nclinical practice. MSProDiscuss facilitates the dialog between\nthe patient and the physician by capturing a structured disease\nhistory. Most of the survey participants indicated that\nMSProDiscuss was beneficial in the discussion of disease\nprogression. Overall, the feedback from the HCPs was very\npositive regarding the integration of MSProDiscuss into their\nclinical practice. The tool was used by physicians, MS nurses\nand nurse practitioners, and pharmacists from very different\npractice settings and was found to be of value; MSProDiscuss\nis a tool that is acceptable to all the users involved in the care\nand management of patients with MS.\nAcknowledgments\nFunding support was provided by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland).
