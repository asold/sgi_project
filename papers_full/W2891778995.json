    "abstract": "The winding is the core component of a transformer, and the technology used to diagnose its current state directly affects the operation and maintenance of the transformer. The mechanical vibration characteristics of a dry-type transformer winding are studied in this paper. A short-circuit test was performed on an SCB10-1000/10 dry-type transformer, and the vibration signal at the surface was measured. Based on actual experimental conditions, a vibration-simulation model of the transformer was established using COMSOL Multiphysics software. A multiphysics coupling simulation of the circuit, magnetic field, and solid mechanics of the transformer was performed on this model. The simulation results were compared with measured data to verify the validity of the simulation model. The simulation model for a transformer operating under normal conditions was then used to develop simulation models of transformer-winding looseness, winding deformation, and winding-insulation failure, and the winding fault vibration characteristics were analyzed. The results provide a basis for detecting and analyzing the mechanical state of transformer windings.",
