A single receiver  can track multi -constellation Global Navigation \nSatellite Systems (GNSS), however, these data should be validated before being used for \npositioning and navigation. Several methods were pr esented in the literature for data \nvalidation including detection of code and phase observation outliers and cycle slips of phase \ndata. For instance, some Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithms \ncheck consistency of solutions from differ ent subsets of satellites (Farrell and Van Graas \n1992; Hwang and Brown 2008; GEAS 2010). Other methods estimate cycle slips as \nadditional unknowns in a least -squares or Kalman filtering processing (Banville and Langly \n2010). Some methods used linear combinations of the observations or their time-difference to \nestimate cycle slips (Blewitt 1990, Kim and Langley 2002). Gui et al. (2011) suggested a \nBayesian approach for the detection of multiple gross errors. The Detection -Identification -\nAdaptation (DIA) is another method for quality control of single -baseline GNSS models \n(Teunissen, 1990). De Bakker el al. (2009) used the DIA method to investigate quality \ncontrol of single -receiver single -satellite with a focus on the analysis of the Minimal \nDetectable Bias (MDB), which is a measure for the size of the errors that can be detected \nwith a certain power and probability of false alarm. Yang et al. (2013a, b) review the fault \ndetection and exclusion approach and discuss probabilities of different types of errors. \nIn addition to quality control of Global Positioning System (GPS) observations, validation \nof data from other GNSS constellations was investigated in De Jong et al. (2001) for GPS \nwith GLONASS data, and in Ene et al. (2007); and Neri et al. (2011) for GPS with Galileo \nobservations. El -Mowafy (2013) investigated validation of BeiDou observations in a \nstandalone mode. A single -receiver single -satellite quality control approach, which is \napplicable to any GNSS with any arbitrary number of frequencies is discus sed in Teunissen \nand De Bakkar (2012) and El-Mowafy (2014a).  \nThis paper is a continuation of the work presented by the author in (El -Mowafy, 2014a) \nusing the single -receiver single -satellite approach for validation of GNSS data. In this \ncontribution, the use of the method validation parameters to provide diagnostics of individual \nEl-Mowafy, A. (2015).

The diagnostics are based on checking \nagreement of characteristics of the validation statistics with theory. Such agreement will take \nplace when data are modelled correctly and they do not have severe  irregularities. The \ndiagnostics of signal irregularities in data sets from three GNSS constellations: GPS, \nGLONASS and Galileo is discussed. The data include observations collected over three \nconsecutive days in a static mode at a continuously operating r eference station, and nine \nhours of observations in a kinematic ship-borne mode.  \n \n2. SINGLE-RECEIVER SINGLE -SATELLITE GEOMETRY -FREE MODELLING.    In \nthis section the single -receiver single-satellite method is reviewed to make this paper self -\ncontained and to provide the necessa ry details of the validation parameters, based on which \nthe diagnostics parameters are derived. In this method, undifferenced code and phase \nobservations of each satellite of a single receiver are screened satellite by satellite, \nindependently at each epoch, and in a sequential manner. The method is applicable for real -\ntime or post-mission processing, in static or kinematic modes.  \nThe carrier phase and pseudorange observation equations of a single satellite tracked by a \nsingle receiver on frequency 𝒇𝒋 (for 𝒋 = 1 to 𝒏) at time instant 𝒕 can be formulated as follows: \n \n𝜙𝑗(𝑡) = 𝜌(𝑡) + 𝑐(𝛿𝑡𝑟(𝑡) − 𝛿𝑡𝑠(𝑡)) + 𝑇(𝑡) − 𝜇𝑗𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑏𝜙𝑗(𝑡) + 𝑏̃𝜙𝑗(𝑡) + 𝜀𝜙𝑗(𝑡)\n𝑝𝑗(𝑡) = 𝜌(𝑡) + 𝑐(𝛿𝑡𝑟(𝑡) − 𝛿𝑡𝑠(𝑡)) + 𝑇(𝑡) + 𝜇𝑗𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑏𝑝𝑗(𝑡) + 𝑏̃𝑝𝑗(𝑡) + 𝜀𝑝𝑗(𝑡)  \n \n(1) \nwhere 𝜙𝑗(𝑡) and 𝑝𝑗(𝑡) denote the observed carrier phase and pseudo ranges in distance units \n(m) respectively, with corresponding zero -mean noise terms 𝜀𝜙𝑗(𝑡) and 𝜀𝑝𝑗(𝑡). 𝜌(𝑡) \ndenotes the receiver -to-satellite range, 𝑐 is the speed of light, 𝛿𝑡𝑟(𝑡) and 𝛿𝑡𝑠(𝑡) are the \nreceiver and satellite clock errors, and 𝑇(𝑡) is the tropospheric delay. The parameter 𝐼(𝑡) \ndenotes the ionospheric delay for code observations and advance for phase observations \nexpressed in units of distance with respect to t he first frequency. For frequency 𝑓𝑗; the \nionospheric coefficient 𝜇𝑗 = 𝑓1\n2/𝑓𝑗\n2 is used to express its ionosphere error in terms of 𝐼(𝑡). \nThe parameters 𝑏𝜙𝑗(𝑡) and 𝑏𝑝𝑗(𝑡) are the phase and code biases, which are considered \nconstant over a s hort period of time (Teunissen and De Bakker 2012b, El -Mowafy et al. \n2010), e.g. an hour, and therefore will be denoted thereafter as 𝑏𝜙𝑗(𝑡𝑜) and 𝑏𝑝𝑗(𝑡𝑜). For \nphase measurements, this bias comprises the sum of the initial phase bias, the phase \nambiguity and the instrumental phase delay, and for code measurements it comprises the \ninstrumental code delay. 𝑏̃𝜙𝑗(𝑡) and 𝑏̃𝑝𝑗(𝑡) denote the unmodelled systemati c errors that are \nnot constant in nature or quasi -random, such as multipath. A geometry -free processing is \napplied where positioning is of no interest at this stage; thus, the satellite orbital error is \nignored.  \nThe ionosphere delay 𝐼(𝑡) can be decomposed into two components; its initial value 𝐼(𝑡𝑜) \nat the initial epoch 𝑡𝑜, and the difference from this value, which is denoted as (𝛿𝐼), such that: \n \n𝐼(𝑡) = 𝐼(𝑡𝑜) + 𝛿𝐼(𝑡) (2) \n \nSimilarly, the bias parameters 𝑏̃𝜙𝑗(𝑡) and 𝑏̃𝑝𝑗(𝑡) at time 𝑡 can be split into two components, \nthe initial values, which are denoted as 𝑏̃𝜙𝑗(𝑡𝑜) and 𝑏̃𝑝𝑗(𝑡𝑜) and the components that will \nchange with time, which are symbolised as 𝛿𝑏𝜙 and 𝛿𝑏𝑝 for phase and code measurements, \nEl-Mowafy, A. (2015). Diagnostic Tools Using a Multi-Constellation Single-Receiver Single-Satellite Data \nValidation Method.

(1) can be reduced by re -parameterisation of the \nunknowns as follows: \n \n𝜌∗(𝑡) = 𝜌(𝑡) + 𝑐(𝛿𝑡𝑟(𝑡) − 𝛿𝑡𝑠(𝑡)) + 𝑇(𝑡) \n𝜌∗∗(𝑡) = 𝜌∗(𝑡) − 𝜌∗(𝑡𝑜) \n𝑏𝜙𝑗\n∗ (𝑡𝑜) = 𝑏𝜙𝑗(𝑡𝑜) + 𝑏̃𝜙𝑗(𝑡𝑜) + [𝜌∗(𝑡𝑜) − 𝜇𝑗𝐼(𝑡𝑜)] \n𝑏𝑝𝑗\n∗ (𝑡𝑜) = 𝑏𝑝𝑗(𝑡𝑜) + 𝑏̃𝑝𝑗(𝑡𝑜) + [𝜌∗(𝑡𝑜) + 𝜇𝑗𝐼(𝑡𝑜)] \n(5) \n(6) \n(7) \n(8) \n \n \nThe observation equations in terms of the re -parameterised vector of unknowns [𝜌∗∗(𝑡), \n𝛿𝐼(𝑡), 𝑏𝜙𝑗\n∗ (𝑡𝑜), 𝑏𝑝𝑗\n∗ (𝑡𝑜), 𝛿𝑏𝜙𝑗(𝑡), 𝛿𝑏𝑝𝑗(𝑡)]𝑇 then read: \n \n𝜙𝑗(𝑡) = 𝜌∗∗(𝑡) − 𝜇𝑗𝛿𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑏𝜙𝑗\n∗ (𝑡𝑜) + 𝛿𝑏𝜙𝑗(𝑡) + 𝜀𝜙𝑗(𝑡)\n𝑝𝑗(𝑡) = 𝜌∗∗(𝑡) + 𝜇𝑗𝛿𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑏𝑝𝑗\n∗ (𝑡𝑜) + 𝛿𝑏𝑝𝑗(𝑡) + 𝜀𝑝𝑗(𝑡)  \n(9) \n𝑏𝜙𝑗\n∗ (𝑡𝑜) and 𝑏𝑝𝑗\n∗ (𝑡𝑜) are constants and can be estimated during initialisation at time 𝑡𝑜 such \nthat for all available phase and codes observations at frequency j (1 ≤  j ≤ n) we have: \n \n[\n \n \n \n \n \n 𝜌∗∗\n𝛿𝐼\n𝑏𝜑𝑗=1..𝑛\n∗\n𝑏𝑃𝑗=1..𝑛\n∗\n𝛿𝑏𝜙𝑗=1..𝑛\n𝛿𝑏𝑝𝑗=1..𝑛 ]\n \n \n \n \n \n \n𝑡=𝑡𝑜\n= \n[\n \n \n \n \n 0\n0\n𝜙𝑗=1..𝑛\n𝑃𝑗=1..𝑛\n0\n0 ]\n \n \n \n \n \n𝑡=𝑡𝑜\n \n(10) \n \nand the corresponding initial covariance matrix reads: \n \n𝑃𝑥𝑜/𝑜 =  𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔[0,0, 𝜎𝜑𝑖=1..𝑛\n2 , 𝜎𝑃𝑖=1..𝑛\n2 , 0,0] (11) \n \nwhere 𝜎𝜑𝑖=1..𝑛\n2  and 𝜎𝑃𝑖=1..𝑛\n2  denote the phase and code variances, respectively.  \n \nThe remaining unknowns in Eq. (9) can be predicted using dynamic modelling in a \nKalman filtering processing, where the predicted unknowns are treated as pseudo -\nobservations; thus, when updated by the code and phase observations rank deficien cy is \nremoved (similar to sequential least squares). The reparametrised unknown range (𝜌∗∗) can be \nconsidered unlinked in time and thus is not considered in the prediction process. The \nionospheric delay 𝛿𝐼 and the bias components 𝛿𝑏𝜙𝑗and 𝛿𝑏𝑝𝑗 are considered changing \nrelatively smoothly with time for a short period (El -Mowafy 2009). This period can be taken \nbetween 15 and 30 minutes, as our tests show, depending on ionospheric activity, time of day \nand year, location (latitude),  and observing conditions. The temporal correlat ions of 𝛿𝐼 is \ntaken exponentially decaying with time by using a first -order autoregressive stochastic \nEl-Mowafy, A. (2015).

Similarly,  the temporal correlations of 𝛿𝑏𝜙𝑗and \n𝛿𝑏𝑝𝑗 are expressed using a first-order autoregressive stochastic process as they do not change \nmuch with time. Thus, the transition matrix reads: \n \n𝛷𝑡/𝑡−1 = 𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔[𝛽𝛿𝐼,𝛽𝛿𝑏𝜙𝑗=1..𝑛\n,  𝛽𝛿𝑏𝑝𝑗=1..𝑛 ] (12) \n  \nwhere 𝛽𝛿𝐼, 𝛽𝛿𝑏𝜙𝑗\n and 𝛽𝛿𝑏𝑝𝑗\n are the temporal correlations for 𝛿𝐼(𝑡), 𝛿𝑏𝜙𝑗(𝑡) and 𝛿𝑏𝑝𝑗(𝑡) for a \nfrequency 𝑗, where 𝛽 = 𝑒−|Δ𝑡|/𝜏. Δ𝑡 is the time interval between the epochs 𝑡 − 1 and 𝑡, and 𝜏 \ndenotes the correlation time length. The variance of each process noise is computed as \n{\n𝜗\n2/𝜏 (1 − 𝛽2)}(Gelb et al. 1974), where 𝜗 denotes its spectral density.  \n \nThe next section describes a basic validation process using this method, from its parameters \nthe proposed diagnostics tools, which are the focus of this paper, can be extracted. \n \n3. LOCAL VALIDATIO N OF THE OBSERVATION S USING THE SINGLE -\nRECEIVER SINGLE-SATELLITE MODEL.   The observation equation in Kalman filtering \nat time 𝒕 in a linearised Gauss–Markov model is given by: \n \n𝑦𝑡 = 𝐴𝑡𝑥̂𝑡/𝑡−1 + 𝑣𝑡 (13) \n \nwhere 𝑦𝑡 is the vector of phase and code observations, 𝑥̂𝑡 is the estimated vector of unknowns \n[𝜌∗∗(𝑡), 𝛿𝐼(𝑡), 𝑏𝜙𝑗\n∗ (𝑡𝑜), 𝑏𝑝𝑗\n∗ (𝑡𝑜), 𝛿𝑏𝜙𝑗(𝑡), 𝛿𝑏𝑝𝑗(𝑡)]𝑇. 𝐴𝑡 is the design matrix, which reads: \n \n𝐴𝑡 = [\n𝑢 −𝜇𝑗\n𝑢 +𝜇𝑗\nI 0\n0 I   I 0\n0 I] (14) \n \nwhere j=1 to n frequencies, u is a column vector of ones with a size n, I is the identity matrix \nof size n. 𝑣𝑡 is the predicted observation residuals with a covariance matrix 𝑄𝑣𝑡 . \nFor detection of errors, local and global testing can be applied, where for l ocal testing one \nexamines the observations at the present epoch and in global testing observations from more \nthan one epoch is considered (Teunissen and Kleusberg, 1998 , Knight  et al., 2010 ). In \ngeneral, the local test can be performed for detection of ou tliers and the global test is needed \nfor detection of cycle slips. In this paper, we will restrict attention to local testing for \ndemonstration of the diagnostics of measurement and model errors, noting that the same \ndiagnostic approach is applicable for the global test mode.  \nTesting can be performed for  𝑞 number of possible errors (or outliers) in the observations, \nwhere q < df, and  df is the degrees of freedom for m observations. If errors are present in the \nobservations, the best estimator of the err or vector ( 𝛻̂𝑡) can be determined from (Teunissen \nand Kleusberg, 1998): \n \n∇̂𝑡= (𝐶𝑣𝑡\n𝑇 𝑄𝑣𝑡\n−1𝐶𝑣𝑡)−1𝐶𝑣𝑡\n𝑇 𝑄𝑣𝑡\n−1𝑣𝑡 (15) \n \n𝑄∇̂𝑡 = (𝐶𝑣𝑡\n𝑇 𝑄𝑣𝑡\n−1𝐶𝑣𝑡)−1 (16) \n \nWhere 𝐶𝑣𝑡 in local testing is m × q matrix that describes which observations are examined, \nsuch that each column of 𝐶𝑣𝑡 is a unit zero vector except the element corresponding to the \nexamined observation, which  equals to one . Possible detection of the presence of model \nEl-Mowafy, A. (2015). Diagnostic Tools Using a Multi-Constellation Single-Receiver Single-Satellite Data \nValidation Method. Journal of Navigation, Vol. 68, No. 1, 196-214, DOI: /10.1017/S0373463314000526    5 \n \nerrors can be perfo rmed by examining the local over -all model test statistic 𝑇𝐿𝑂𝑀, which can \nbe formulated as: \n \n𝑇𝐿𝑂𝑀 = 𝛻̂𝑡\n𝑇𝑄𝛻̂𝑡\n−1𝛻̂𝑡 (17) \n  \nand measurement or model errors are suspected when: \n \n𝑇𝐿𝑂𝑀 ≥ 𝜒𝛼\n2(𝑑𝑓, 0) (18) \n  \nwhere 𝜒𝛼\n2 is the chi -squared value for a significance level 𝛼. Lehmann (2012) investigated \nimproving the test threshold by considering the dependencies between the residuals. \n \nOnce the presence of model errors is detected, one needs to identify the erroneous \nmeasurement(s) that cause such model errors. For the case of a single outlier in one code or \nphase observation, i.e. 𝑞 = 1, the 𝐶𝑣𝑡 matrix reduces to a column vector, and 𝛻̂𝑡 becomes a \nscalar. The test statistic can be computed for observation i as follows (Baarda 1968):  \n \n𝑤𝑖 = 𝛻̂𝑖\n𝜎𝛻̂𝑖\n \n(19) \n \nwhere 𝜎∇̂𝑖 is the standard deviation of 𝛻̂𝑖, and an outlier is considered present in the data \nwhen:  \n \n|𝑤𝑖| ≥ 𝑁𝛼\n2\n(0,1),   |wi| ≥ |wk|   for k= 1 to m (20) \n \nThe error vector (𝛻𝑥) in the dynamic model of the unknowns (states) can be expressed as: \n \n𝑥̂𝑡 =  𝛷𝑡/𝑡−1𝑥̂𝑡−1 + 𝐶𝑥 𝛻𝑥 + 𝑑𝑡 \n \n(21) \nwhere dt represents the process noise and the matrix Cx maps the state model error of \ndimensions, i.e. the number of predicted states × the number of model errors under \nconsideration (e.g. Hewitson and Wang 2007) . The matrix 𝐶𝑣𝑡 used in Eq. 15 and 16 then \nreads: \n \n𝐶𝑣𝑡 = − 𝐴𝑡  𝜓𝑡 (22) \n \nwhere 𝜓𝑡 describes the response of a model error on the predicted state vector, which in the \ncase of a jump in the state vector reads (Teunissen, 1990): \n \n𝜓𝑡 = 𝛷𝑡,𝑡−1[𝐼 − 𝐾𝑡 𝐴𝑡]𝜓𝑡−1        (23) \n \n initilizing with 𝜓𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑐ℎ = 𝐶𝑥, where Kt denote the Kalman gain matrix. For the case of \na permanent slip in the state vector, the error manifests itself as a systematic disturbance, and  \n𝜓𝑡 becomes: \n \n𝜓𝑡 = 𝐶𝑥 + 𝛷𝑡,𝑡−1[𝐼 − 𝐾𝑡 𝐴𝑡]𝜓𝑡−1        \n \n \n(24) \nEl-Mowafy, A. (2015). Diagnostic Tools Using a Multi-Constellation Single-Receiver Single-Satellite Data \nValidation Method. Journal of Navigation, Vol. 68, No. 1, 196-214, DOI: /10.1017/S0373463314000526    6 \n \n \nEffectiveness of the single -receiver single-satellite validation method in detection and \nidentification of outliers in the observations was demonstrated in El -Mowafy, 2014 a, in \nwhich the ability of the algorithm to detect more than 6000 artificial errors in data sets that \nspan several days in March 2012  (a period of medium -to-high ionosphere activity ) was \nexamined at a reference station (CUT0) at Curtin University, Australia. The range of inserted \nerrors was selected such that the minimum errors tested were at the level of the so called \nminimum detectable biases (MDBs). MDB is the error that can be detected with the chosen \nprobabilities of false alarm and miss -detection (Teunissen and Kleusberg, 1998). The MDBs \nare computed from the covariance matrix of the observations and according to the \nobservation model. For our model, the MDBs were 0.6 m for code observations and less than \none cycle for phase data for the three constellations GPS, GLONAS and Galileo. The average \nrates of successful detection of artificial errors (from 0.6 m to 5 m) inserted in the code data \nwere between 94.3% and 99.63%, which varie d according to signal quality and number of \nobservations. The method succe ss rate in detetion of cycle slips between one cycle and 6 \ncycles inserted in the data was 94.4% -100%. Evaluation of the method performance in \ncorrect identification of code outliers showed that the method was successful in identifying \n90% to 99% of its ou tliers. For more details, interested reader may refer to El -Mowafy \n(2014a). \nThe ionosphere level can affect performance of  error detection. In addition to the test \nresults discussed above, which were performed during a medium-to-high ionosphere activity \nperiod at a mid-latittude point, two tests were carried out uing two-day data sets collected in \nJuly 2013 (high ionosphere activity) at the Intenational GNSS Service (IGS) stations NKLG \n(Gabon-Africa) and SIN 1 (Singapore-Asia). The data were obtained online from the Multi -\nGNSS (MGEX) web portal. Both stations are close to the Equator. Since the change in the \nionosphere (δI) is estimated at each epoch as one of the unknowns, its stochastic parameters \nwere modified to account for possible expected changes in the ionosphere activity. A method \nfor estimation of the stochastic parameters of the presented method using the single-receiver \nsingle-satellite approach is given in El -Mowafy (2014b). Similar to the above test, t he \nperformance of detetion of code outliers and phase cycle slips w as evaluated by examining \nthe ability of the method to detect artificially inserted errors in the data (356 code outliers \nranging from 0.6 m to 5 m and 220 cycle slips ranging between 1 cycle and five cycles). The \nperformance of the method in this test was consistent as t esting results were almost at the \nsame level experienced at the mid-latitude station CUT0 with a success rate above 90%.  \nThe single-receiver single-satellite method for validation of GNSS data has the advantage \nthat since a geometry -free model is used, n o satellite need to be known beforehand, thus no \ncomplete navigation messages ne ed to be read and used. In this case, observation weighting \ncan be performed using, for instance, the signal -to-noise ratio. In addition, detection can be \nperformed for a single or multi-frequency observations, unlike most existing outlier and cycle \nslip d etection methods, which require the use of dual -frequency data . Furthermore, the \napproach is able to detect faulty measurements for systems with a limited number of \nsatellites, such as Galileo and QZSS, without the need for having a complete solution. When  \nusing data from different constellations there is no need for the determination of inter -system \nbiases. Finally, the method allows one to present numerical and graphical statistical \ndiagnostics as will be discussed in the next sections.  In principle, t he method is generic, and \nthus it is applicable in post -mission and real -time to single -fequency or multi -frequency \napplications, such as single point positioning (SPP), precise point positioning (PPP), \ndifferential positioning (for each receiver separately) , Real-time Kinematic (RTK) , Network \nRTK and PPP-RTK. \n \nEl-Mowafy, A.

The characteristics of the validation para  meters of the single-\nreceiver single-satellite method provide numeric and graphical diagnostics for the signals and \nthe correctness of the model. One diagnostic tool is by checking that the estimated w -test \nstatistic of the observed signals has a standard normal distribution, N(0, 1). Such condition \nwould not take place if modelling or observation weighting are incorrectly applied, or in the \npresence of a series of large outliers or cycle slips in the tested data. Another diagnostic tool \nis to check the distribution of the over -all model test statistic 𝑇𝐿𝑂𝑀. This statistic when \ndivided by the degrees of freedom 𝑑𝑓 should follow a Fisher distribution if the model is set \ncorrectly and the stochastic assumptions are valid. In this section, the diagnostic analysis and \nresults for the two types of diagnostics will be performed for a static and kinematic test data. \n \n4.1. Description of the Data Used.  The use of the proposed approach for diagnostics of \nthe multi -frequency multi -constellation GNSS observations and the used model is given \nthrough practical experiments in static and kinematic modes. In the static test, the data used \nwere collected at a continuously operating reference station at Curtin University, Australia. \nThe data span three days, 15/3/2012 to 17/3/2012, with 30 seconds sampling interval. \nObservations from GPS, GLONASS and Galileo were collected using a geodetic-grade multi-\nfrequency multi-GNSS antenna (TRM59800.00) and receiver (Septentrio POLARX4). \nTracked signals in the test included L1, L2 and L5 code and phase observations for GPS, L1 \nand L2 for GLONASS, and E1, E5a and E5b for Galileo. The kinematic test was carried out \non 26/4/2012, where a similar multi-constellation antenna was mounted on a boat, starting its \ncourse from Fremantle harbour in Perth, Western Australia and reaching up a point located \nalmost six kilometres offshore. GPS and GLONASS data that span almost 9.3 hours w ith a \nsampling interval of one second were collected using a Sokkia GSR2700ISX receiver.  \n4.2. Examples of w-test Statistic  Results.   Figures 1 to 4 show three examples of \nprocessing data from the three GNSS constellations under consideration in the static test. The \nfigures depict the time -series and histograms of w -test statistic values on 15/3/2012 for GPS \nsatellite PRN 13 (Block IIR satellite with Rubidium clock), GLONASS satellite PRN 18, and \nthe Galileo satellite GIOVE A (considered in this context with PRN 51), using the letter \nidentifiers G, R and E for the three systems respectively. The shown w-test statistic values are \ncomputed by weighting the observations using an elevation -angle dependent model in the \nform [𝟏 + 𝒂𝟎 × 𝒆𝒙𝒑(−𝑬𝒐/𝑬𝒐\n𝒐)] (Euler and Goad 1991), where 𝒂𝟎 is a weighting coefficient \nthat is dependent on the type and frequency of the observation, receiver and method used for \nthe observation tracking (e.g. Z -tracking, codeless, semi -codeless, etc.). 𝑬𝒐 and 𝑬𝒐\n𝒐 are the \nobserved elevation angle and a selected base value for the elevation angle in degrees. In this \nstudy, the weight model is selected as (𝟏 + 𝟏𝟎 × 𝒆(−𝑬𝒐/𝟏𝟎𝒐)) with an average value of 𝒂𝟎 \n=10 (Teunissen and de Bakker 2012b). The st andard deviations along the zenith used for the \nundifferenced observations were taken from the literature. The elevation angles were \nobtained from satellite almanacs and approximate test point position determined using single \npoint positioning of available  GPS satellites performed in a prior step to the data screening \nprocess using the single-receiver single-satellite method. \nThe left side of Figures 1 and 2 shows time-series of the computed w -test statistic values \nfor 𝜙1, 𝜙2, 𝑝1, and 𝑝2, which refer to  the phase and code measurements for the frequencies \nL1 and L2 for GPS and GLONASS satellites. The change of the signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) \nvalues in dB-Hz for L1 with respect to the observed satellite elevation angles are illustrated in \nthe bottom of the left side of the Figures 1 to 4, where the SNR is displayed in dark dots and \nthe elevation angles are illustrated as solid lines. The right sides of the Figures show the \nhistograms and the probability density function ( pdf) of the corresponding w -test statistic \nvalues, where the computed standard deviation ( 𝜎𝑤) and the mean ( 𝜇𝑤) of the w-test statistic \nare given on top of each figure.  \nEl-Mowafy, A.

From Eq. (2 5), the correlation between errors is \ndependent on two factors; the functional relationship of the observations with the unknowns \n(design matrix), and the precision of the observations ( 𝑄𝑦). From the anlysis of our model, \nthe correlation between phase observation errors is almost -1 whereas the correlation between \ncode observation errors is almost zero  as shown in Table 1. The Table g ives the average \nvalues of the correlations over the test period for various types of observation errors for GPS \nsatellite PRN 18, taken as an example , where similar values are obtained for other satellites . \nThe high correlation between observations will result in Type III (Hawkins, 1980) error, \nwhere the null hypothesis (assuming no outliers in the data) is correctly rejected but the \nwrong observation is identified as being faulty. This means that specific ph ase observations \nthat have outliers will be hard to identify whereas identification of outliers is p ossible for \ncode observations.  \n \nTable 1.

Again, the similarities shown in the figure among w -test statistics for \nGalileo phase observations can be explained by their correlations. The w -test statistic values \nfor the associated code measurements are depicted in Figure 4 in the same order. The critical \nvalues (thresholds) for w -test statistic [𝑁𝛼\n2\n(0,1)] are shown in the Figures 1 to 4 as solid red \nlines. In practice, the significance level ( 𝛼) needed for the computation of the critical values \nshould be selected based on requirements of the application at hand. We assume here that 𝛼 \nequals 0.001, which is a reasonable value for prec ise positioning. For 𝑞=1, the critical value \nfor w-test statistic is ±3.29. A possible outlier or cycle slip (as low as one cycle) is suspected \nwhen the computed w-test statistic exceeds this critical value. \n   \n4.3. Diagnostics Analysis Using the w -test S tatistic.  The w-test statistic results for the \ngiven examples from the three systems: GPS, GLONASSS and Galileo are checked to see if \nthey approximately follow a standard normal distribution with the selected significance level, \nwhich may give a first ind ication about correctness of the used model. The following checks \nwere performed for each observation type in the tested satellites: \ni- Visual inspection of the histograms to check if the w -test statistic varies in a random \nmanner, with a standard normal dist ribution. This is shown in the Figures 1 to 4, for \nwhich the model and stochastic information are set correctly. On the other hand, Figure 5 \nillustrates two examples of incorrect modelling for the same observations of GPS \nsatellite PRN 13  used in Figure 1. In the first example, shown in Figure 5-a, the \nionosphere was incorrectly modelled (replacing the positive sign of the ionosphere error \nin the code observation model with a negative sign, imitating a software coding mistake). \nIn the second example, depict ed in figure 5-b, the process noise parameters were \nincorrectly set (amplifying the code spectral density 10 times of the assumed correct \nvalue). As shown, the w -test statistic histograms in both cases significantly deviate from \nEl-Mowafy, A. (2015).

Another example for \ndiagnostics of errors in the dynamic model is given in Figure 6 for GPS satellite PRN 31 \nin the kinematic test data  (after applying the process of detection and identification of \nobservation errors) , where F igure 6(a) show results of a correctly assumed first -order \nGauss-Markov model for the parameters 𝛿𝐼, 𝛿𝑏𝜙𝑗, and 𝛿𝑏𝑝𝑗. On the other hand, Figure \n6(b) depict s a case of using a dynamic model of these parameters with an artificial \npermanent slip s inserted that is for testing purpose  (which is arbitrary taken for \nillustration purpose approximately equivalent to three times the temporal correlations \nused in the first case). As the figure shows the presence of the slips in the dynamic model \nhas resulted in changing the graphical distribution of the w -statistic as well as its mean \nvalue and standard deviation from that of the theoretical standard normal distribution. \n \n     \n(a) (b) \n Figure 5.

An example of a normal plot with an accurate variance is given in Figure 8. \nThe skewness or short/long tails of points on the plot indicate skewness and tailing of \ndata distribution. Inference of the plot would help in tuning th e variance of the \nobservations. For instance, long tails with an ‘S’ shaped -curve, as the case of the given \nexample, indicates that the data have more variance than expected from data of a normal \ndistribution. On the other hand, short tails indicate less v ariance than one would expect. \nThe Q-Q plots can be used as an alternative to the normal probability plots. The Q-Q plot \nis used to compare the quantile of the data presented on the vertical axis to that of a \nstandard normal population exemplified on the h orizontal axis. The quantiles can be \nobtained by inverting the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the data. Similar to \nthe normal plot, the linearity of the points suggests that the data are normally distributed .  \nThe offset between the line and the points suggests that the mean of the data is not “0”. \niii- Examination of the mean using the z-test, computing the test statistic:  \n \n𝑧 = 𝑥̅ − 𝜇\n𝜎/√𝑛 (26) \n \nunder the assumption that w-statistic values are independent, where 𝑥̅ is the sample \nmean, 𝜇 is the hypothesized population mean, 𝜎 is the population standard deviation, and \n𝑛 is the sample size. Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic will have a standard \nnormal distribution, N(0,1). Test results showed that, in general, the test passes for the \ndata at hand where the computed P -values were greater than the critical value in more \nthan 94% of the cases using 𝛼=0.05, which is usually considered for similar type of \ntesting. It was observed that the cases where the test fails are usually coup led with failing \nthe detection test given in Eq.

For the test data considered here, the test was successful in 91% of \nthe cases. It was observed that the cases where the test fails are usually associated with \nfailing the detection test.  \n \n \n \nFigure 7.

The errors  have resulted in the distribution of the w -test statistic that does not \nagree with the standard normal distribution as depicted in Figure 8, where the shown range of \nthe w -test statistic values in the histogram plots were limited to ±4 for better visual \ncomparison with other figures , and therefore  the spikes in the figure corresponding to  the \nmaximum values of w-statistic are not shown. Large standard deviations (approximately 3 to \n9) of the w statistic and some scattered spikes in the distribution  can be seen . In addition, a \ncomparison between the pdf of the data (pdf data) against the pdf of the standard normal \ndistribution (pdf snd) is illustrated on the right hand side of the figure.

Another diagnostic that can be utilised \nfrom the output of the single-receiver single-satellite validation method is to check whether \nthe test statistic 𝑇𝐿𝑂𝑀 when divided by the degrees of freedom 𝑑𝑓 follows a Fisher \ndistribution if the model is set correctly and the observations do not have significant \nirregularities.

The single-receiver single -satellite validation method of GNSS \nmeasurements is applicable to any GNSS with any arbitrary number of frequencies. It is \nshown how the data validation parameters can provide numeric and graphical diagnostics for \nthe individual satellite observations, which is a desirable task for several applications  such as \nSPP, PPP, RTK and PPP -RTK. The diagnostics can also show whether the model is set \ncorrectly. Two of these diagnostics were presented. The first is by checking that the estimated \nw-test statistic of the observed signals follows a standard normal distribution. The second \ndiagnostic is by checking that the local overall model statistic in one form follows a Fisher \ndistribution. The method was demonstrated using phase and code data from GPS, GLONASS \nand Galileo on all their frequencies for test data that span three days in a static test site, and \nfor almost nine hours in a kinematic ship -borne mode. The diagnoses for incorrect modelling \nand severe irregularities in the data are demonstrated through some examples.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n \nThe author would like to thank Prof. P.J.G.
