Previous studies on tool site selection have addressed the relevance of \ntargeted resources and raw materials for tools, but few have considered the broader \nforaging landscape. In this landscape-scale study of the ecological contexts of wild \nchimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) tool use, we investigated the conditions required \nfor nut-cracking to occur and persist in discrete locations at the long-term field site \nof Bossou, Guinea. We examined this at three levels: selection, frequency of use, \nand inactivity. We collected data on plant foods, nut trees, and raw materials using \ntransect and quadrat methods, and conducted forest-wide surveys to map the loca -\ntion of nests and watercourses. We analysed data at the quadrat level ( n = 82) using \ngeneralised linear models and descriptive statistics. We found that, further to the \npresence of a nut tree and availability of raw materials, abundance of food-providing \ntrees as well as proximity to nest sites were significant predictors of nut-cracking \noccurrence. This suggests that the spatial distribution of nut-cracking sites is medi -\nated by the broader behavioural landscape and is influenced by non-extractive for -\naging of perennial resources and non-foraging activities. Additionally, the number \nof functional tools was greater at sites with higher nut-cracking frequency, and was \nnegatively correlated with site inactivity. Our research indicates that the technologi -\ncal landscape of Bossou chimpanzees shares affinities with the ‘favoured places’ \nmodel of hominin site formation, providing a comparative framework for recon -\nstructing landscape-scale patterns of ancient human behaviour. A French translation \nof this abstract is provided in theelectronic supplementary information: EMS 2.\nKey words behavioural ecology · landscape use · nut-cracking · primate \narchaeology · wild chimpanzees\nHandling Editor: Joanna Setchell\n * Katarina Almeida-Warren \n katarina.almeida-warren@anthro.ox.ac.uk\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\nInternational Journal of Primatology (2022) 43:885–912\nReceived: 21 March 2022 / Accepted: 28 May 2022 /  Published online: 7 July 2022\n1 3\nIntroduction\nThe local environment plays an important role in shaping non-human primate behav-\niour from foraging strategies, to ranging patterns, and sociality (Robbins & Hohm-\nann, 2006; Strier, 2011). Tool-use, particularly for extractive foraging, is no excep-\ntion. Recent studies have highlighted that ecology is key in determining whether \ntool-use emerges in a population, how it manifests itself, and how it is maintained \nonce it is established (S. Carvalho et  al., 2007, 2011; Grund et  al., 2019; Koops \net al., 2013, 2014).\nStone tool-use is often recurrent in spatially discrete locations, frequently \ninvolves the reuse of tools, and leaves a recognisable archaeological footprint that \ncan be traced back thousands of years (S. Carvalho et al., 2009; Falótico et al., \n2019; Mercader et al., 2007). However, little is known about the ecological fac-\ntors influencing selection and repeated use of specific locations for these activi-\nties and how they fit within the broader foraging landscape. Lithic-based foraging \ntechnology has been observed in several wild, non-human primate species includ-\ning chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus and P. t. ellioti, formerly P.t. vellerosus; \nWhiten et al., 1999; Abwe & Morgan, 2008), bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapa-\njus libidinosus; Ottoni & Izar, 2008), Burmese long-tailed macaques (Macaca \nfascicularis; Gumert et  al., 2009), and, most recently, in white-faced capuchins \n(Cebus capuchinus; Barrett et al., 2018).\nChimpanzees are of particular interest because they are one of our closest liv -\ning relatives (Langergraber et al., 2012), and they present one of the largest, most \ndiverse and ecologically adaptable technological repertoire among non-human spe-\ncies, reflecting a level of cognitive flexibility akin to the earliest hominin toolmak -\ners (S. Carvalho et al., 2013; Pascual-Garrido & Almeida-Warren, 2021; Rolian & \nCarvalho, 2017). Chimpanzee nut-cracking assemblages are very similar to the low-\ndensity assemblages characteristic of the early hominin record (S. Carvalho et al., \n2008; S. Carvalho & McGrew, 2012). Thus, understanding how patterns of nut-\ncracking behaviour accumulate across the landscape can provide valuable insights \ninto the formation and spatial distribution of early hominin assemblages, and allow \nthe modelling of ancient landscape use and resource exploitation.\nResearch on chimpanzee nut-cracking has established that the spatial availability \nof nut trees and raw materials for tools influences site location and reuse, as well as \nfrequency and distance of tool transport (Boesch & Boesch, 1984; S. Carvalho et al., \n2007, 2011; Luncz et al., 2016). Nevertheless, nut-cracking assemblages are yet to be \nexplored within the context of the broader ecological and foraging landscape. This \nrequires the study of nut-cracking sites not only in relation to direct ecological corre-\nlates such as access to raw materials and nuts, but also in relation to ecological require-\nments of other daily activities critical to survival such as food, water, and shelter.\nChimpanzees living in forested environments spend approximately 50% of their \nwaking hours foraging and travelling between feeding locations (Pruetz & Bertolani, \n2009). Studies have shown that chimpanzee ranging patterns are dynamic and are \naffected by the spatial distribution and seasonality of food (Trapanese et al., 2019; \nWrangham, 1977), which may also influence where non-foraging activities, such as \n886 K. Almeida-Warren et al.\n1 3\nnesting, take place (Basabose & Yamagiwa, 2002; Hernandez-Aguilar, 2009; Jan-\nmaat et al., 2014). Their diet mainly consists of fruit, followed by leaves and ter -\nrestrial herbs (Goodall, 1963; Morgan & Sanz, 2006), but high-energy foods such as \ninsects, nuts, and honey acquired through tool-assisted foraging are also important \nstaples or nutritional supplements for many chimpanzee populations (Sanz & Mor -\ngan, 2013). Yet, little is known about how extractive foraging interacts with other \nfeeding activities and the broader behavioural landscape.\nWater is essential to life (Popkin et al., 2010). For savannah-dwelling chimpan-\nzees living in extremely arid conditions, water is a critical resource that constrains \nmovement patterns and landscape use (Lindshield et  al., 2021; Pruetz & Herzog, \n2017; Wessling, Deschner, et  al., 2018a; Wessling, Kühl, et  al., 2018b). At face \nvalue, water provides hydration and a medium in which primates, and other living \norganisms, can stay cool. However, when examined in the broader foraging and \nbehavioural context, other equally important qualities emerge. Most notably, water \nsustains plant species. These not only give shade but also provide a range of foods, \nsome of which may not be encountered elsewhere. For some chimpanzee popula-\ntions, water is also a source of aquatic resources such as algae (Boesch, Bombja-\nková, et al., 2017; Humle & Matsuzawa, 2009) and fresh-water crabs (Koops et al., \n2019). Finally, free-flowing water can transport stone cobbles, and therefore serve \nas a source of raw materials for stone tools. This relationship has been proposed \nto explain the correlation between chimpanzee nut-cracking sites and hydrological \nfeatures in Diécké, Guinea (Carvalho, 2011; Carvalho et  al., 2007), although this \nremains to be empirically tested.\nChimpanzees habitually make a sleeping nest at the end of every day, and some-\ntimes make day nests for resting (Koops et al., 2012). They have been an important \nfocus of research since Sept (1992) recognised that they form clusters of debris akin \nto early hominin assemblages, and saw their potential for understanding patterns \nof early hominin landscape use and the origins of human shelter (McGrew, 2021). \nNesting locations have subsequently been linked with a range of ecological parame-\nters such as tree species and tree architecture, as well as surrounding topography and \nvegetation types (Badji et al., 2018; J. S. Carvalho et al., 2015; Hernandez-Aguilar, \n2009; Hernandez-Aguilar et al., 2013; Koops et al., 2012; Ndiaye et al., 2018; Stew-\nart et  al., 2011). Other studies have found additional links between nest sites and \nproximity to areas of high fruit availability (Basabose & Yamagiwa, 2002; Furuichi \n& Hashimoto, 2004; Goodall, 1962; Janmaat et al., 2014), and that these correla-\ntions are not universal (Koops et al., 2012). While the exact conditions determin-\ning nest site suitability appear to be population-specific, these findings demonstrate \nthat nesting activities shape chimpanzee landscape use, and, in turn, are shaped by \nresource distribution and the local environment. Nevertheless, little is known about \nhow nesting relates to other activities such as spatially discreet forms of tool use \n(e.g., nut-cracking and termite-fishing).\nUnderstanding how technological landscapes are shaped by the broader behav -\nioural and ecological contexts can be dissected into three key points of inquiry: 1) \ntool site selection — where tool use occurs, 2) tool site use — how often tool use \ntakes place at these locations, and 3) tool site inactivity — what conditions lead to \nthe abandonment of a tool site. Studying the spatial ecology of technical activities is \n887Landscaping the behavioural ecology of primate stone tool…\n1 3\ncrucial to understanding how tool sites emerge in spatially discrete locations. There \nis a growing body of research on differential habitat use for daily activities such as \nforaging, travelling, socializing, and sleeping, particularly in relation to human-mod-\nified landscapes and implications for conservation (Bryson-Morrison et  al., 2017; \nPotts et  al., 2016). With regard to technological activities, we are also beginning \nto learn about raw material selection for tool use and manufacture (Carvalho et al., \n2008; Pascual-Garrido & Almeida-Warren, 2021), yet how such ecological variables \nmay affect the selection of locations for tool use remains largely unexplored.\nHow often a site is used can serve as a proxy for inferring preference in relation \nto other sites. From an archaeological perspective, generally the more a location is \nused for debris-generating activities, the larger and more conspicuous an archaeologi-\ncal signature becomes. This has important implications for understanding the spatial \nclustering of activities and material evidence over time, and can offer many insights \ninto the formation and perpetuity of early hominin archaeological assemblages \n(Carvalho & Almeida-Warren, 2019; McGrew, 2010). Ethnoarchaeological studies \nof chimpanzee nests have found that sleeping sites are frequently revisited, and the \nnests themselves may be reused (Hernandez-Aguilar, 2009; Sept, 1992; Stewart et al., \n2011). However, comparable literature on the use of tool sites is scarce, except for the \nreuse of stone tools (Carvalho et al., 2009), and sources of perishable raw materials \n(Pascual-Garrido, 2018; Pascual-Garrido & Almeida-Warren, 2021).\nChimpanzees live in dynamic landscapes shaped by environmental change. \nWhether natural or anthropogenic, these shifts often result in changes in resource \ndistributions that may in turn lead to the development of new behavioural adapta-\ntions and ranging patterns (e.g., Kalan et al., 2020). New opportunities may arise \n(e.g., foraging food from crops: Hockings et al., 2015, Hockings et al., 2012; nest-\ning in novel plant species: McCarthy et al., 2017), while formerly habitual activi-\nties may shift to new locations or become obsolete (Gruber et al., 2012; Kühl et al., \n2019). Environmental changes have been identified as important drivers of our own \nevolutionary history (Bobe et  al., 2002; Bobe & Carvalho, 2019; Joordens et  al., \n2019; R. Potts, 1998; Potts et al., 2020; Reed, 1997), but few studies have addressed \nempirically how these changes may have affected patterns of landscape use and the \ndistribution of early hominin tool sites (e.g., Rogers et al., 1994). Thus, investigating \nthe conditions that influence the cessation of activity at chimpanzee tool sites, can \nprovide important clues as to the factors that lead to their temporary or long-term \nabandonment.\nIn this study, we explore the relationship between tool use and the broader behav-\nioural and ecological landscapes by investigating the ecological drivers of chimpan-\nzee nut-cracking at the long-term field site of Bossou (Guinea). We examine, at a \nlandscape-scale, the conditions required for nut-cracking to occur and persist over \ntime in spatially discrete locations, termed tool sites. To achieve this, we divided our \ninvestigation into three steps: tool site selection, tool site use, and tool site inactivity. \nFor each of these steps, we assess the effect of ecological parameters that have been \nfound to correlate with nut-cracking activities (nut availability; abundance of raw \nmaterials; distance to water) as well as variables that encapsulate two key aspects of \nchimpanzee activity patterns: non-extractive foraging (abundance of food resources: \nwild food trees; terrestrial herbaceous vegetation — THV) and sleeping (distance to \n888 K. Almeida-Warren et al.\n1 3\nnesting site). We employed archaeological and ecological methods for data collec-\ntion and performed our analyses within an exploratory framework.\nMethods\nStudy site and subjects\nBossou (7° 39′ N, 8° 30′ W) is located in the southeasternmost corner of the Repub-\nlic of Guinea (West Africa), 6 km from the foothills of Mount Nimba Strict Nature \nReserve (Fig.  1) (Humle, 2011a; Yamakoshi & Sugiyama, 1995). The chimpanzee \ncommunity has been studied continuously in both natural (since 1976) and experi-\nmental (outdoor laboratory since 1988) settings (Matsuzawa, 2011 ; Sugiyama & \nKoman, 1979). Between 1976 and 2003 the community was composed of 18 to 23 \nindividuals (Sugiyama, 2004), but has since declined largely due to a catastrophic \nflu-like epidemic from which it never recovered (Humle, 2011b; Sugiyama & Fujita, \n2011). At the time of this study, the population consisted of seven individuals. The \nBossou chimpanzees habitually crack and consume oil-palm nuts (Elaeis guineen-\nsis) and are currently one of only three communities known to use portable stones \nas both hammers and anvils (Ohashi, 2015). Bossou has two seasons — a short \ndry season lasting from November to February, and a long rainy season extending \nfrom March to October (Humle, 2011a; Yamakoshi, 1998). Nut-cracking occurs \nFig. 1  Map of t he Bossou Forest and surrounding area.

Within this, the chimpanzees range in a core area \nof approximately 7 \n km2 (Hockings et al., 2006). The habitat is comprised of a com-\nposite of primary, secondary, and riverine forests, savannah, and cultivated fields \n(Hockings et al., 2012). The northern slope of Mont Gban, in the eastern part of the \nforest, is considered a sacred area — forêt sacrée — by the local Manon culture, and \naccess is forbidden to outsiders. Out of respect to this tradition, we did not conduct \nany research in this area.\nData collection\nWe collected data over two field trips: 14 December 2017 to 01 May 2018 and \n28 October 2018 to 13 December 2018, encompassing 160 days of fieldwork. We \nemployed a mixed-method approach that combined direct behavioural observa-\ntion through group follows of the chimpanzee community, with archaeological \ndocumentation of nut-cracking sites (indirect behavioural observations; as per \nS. Carvalho & Almeida-Warren, 2019), and ecological research using the tran-\nsect and quadrat method (as per S. Carvalho et al., 2011). Initially, we targeted \nnut-cracking sites that had previously been documented by SC in 2006 and \nFig. 2  Map of t he study site and surrounding area of Bossou (Guinea), highlighting the locations of \nrecorded nut-cracking sites, quadrats, nests, and watercourses.\n890 K. Almeida-Warren et al.\n1 3\n2008–2009, and expanded this sample to include any new nut-cracking sites that \nwere discovered during the ecological surveys and group follows. For each nut-\ncracking site, we established 1-km transects intersecting the site datum at 500 m. \nHowever, if a nut-cracking sites was located within 100 m of a pre-established \ntransect, we either assigned it to that transect or made it the mid-point of a new \nperpendicular transect in cases where those areas had not yet been recorded, to \nensure even forest coverage. Our transects (n  = 18) were oriented N–S or E–W, \nexcept for two that were oriented NE–SW and NW–SE due to access difficulties \n(Fig. 2). We established 5-m radius survey quadrats (n  = 198) at 100-m intervals \nalong the transects starting from the midpoint where the nut-cracking site was \nlocated. At each quadrat we collected nut-cracking specific and general ecologi-\ncal and vegetation data (further details below).\nWe collected data digitally. This included georeferencing quadrat mid-points and \nall data entries (food-providing vegetation, tools, raw materials) using an Arrow \nGold GNSS receiver (μ\nHRMS = 2 m; Almeida-Warren et al., 2021; EOS Positioning \nSystems Inc., 2017). These coordinates were then instantly downloaded via Blue-\ntooth into the GeoGrafi-M application (Mobile GIS Services, 2019) on an android \ndevice where we could enter additional data through customized forms.\nThe data collection period overlapped with two unrelated experimental projects \nthat were being conducted at the “Salon” outdoor laboratory and involved the pro-\nvisioning of stones and oil palm nuts for chimpanzees to crack. The “Salon” was \nestablished in 2009 and is located in an area that, historically, has always experi-\nenced a high degree of natural thoroughfare (Matsuzawa, 2011). It is near an active \nnatural nut-cracking site (~ 80 m; Fig.  2) and is at the intersection of several routes \nwhich the chimpanzees frequently travel through to access different parts of the for -\nest. These characteristics were targeted specifically to minimize the potential impact \non natural behaviour (Matsuzawa, 2011). Thus, while some nut-cracking occurred \nartificially, we consider the impact on our overall study to be minimal. Nevertheless, \nwe deliberate on some potential implications in the discussion.\nOil palms\nFor each oil palm encountered during quadrat surveys, we measured the diameter \nat breast height (DBH) with a diameter tape. For the nut trees associated with nut-\ncracking sites, we also collected weekly information on new traces of nut-cracking \nand the availability of edible nuts on the ground. With aid from field assistants, we \ndetermined nut edibility by collecting a random sample of nuts within a 2-metre \nradius of the oil palm to estimate how many contained an edible kernel or were rot-\nten (following Koops et al., 2013). We did not crack open the nuts so as not to affect \nfuture availability, but the local people harvest palm fruits and nuts and are able to \nidentify whether or not they are edible (Humle & Matsuzawa, 2004). As per Koops \net al. (2013), we scored presence of edible nuts as: (0) nuts absent, (1) 1–50 nuts, (2) \n51–100 nuts, and (3) > 100 nuts.\nWe monitored the nut-cracking sites weekly during the first field season (22 \nJanuary 2018–03 May 2018) and once at the beginning and end of the second \nseason (weeks of 29 October 2018 and 10 December 2018) to record evidence of \n891Landscaping the behavioural ecology of primate stone tool…\n1 3\nnut-cracking activity and availability of oil palm nuts. HDC collected additional \nmonitoring data during the weeks of 30 September 2019, 27 April 2020, and 25 \nMay 2020. However, only the nut-cracking sites documented prior to 22 January (n \n= 25) were checked for the full 15 weeks.\nTools and raw materials\nWe recorded all lithic material according to size (the length of the longest axis), raw \nmaterial type, and portability (whether loose or imbedded in the ground). Adapted \nfrom Koops et al. (2013), we scored size into six categories: (1) 1–2 cm, (2) 3–5 \ncm, (3) 6–10 cm, (4) 11–20 cm, (5) 21–30 cm, and (6) >30 cm. We defined tools \nand by-products of nut-cracking as stones that showed at least one of the following: \na) traces of wear from nut-cracking, b) nutshell remains on or around them, and c) \ncould be refitted with another stone with evidence of a) or b). For this study, the var-\niable Tools included all lithic materials used for nut-cracking except for fragments \nthat could no longer be used for nut-cracking.\nWe also scored the collective tool assemblage for status of nut-cracking activity, \neither: (Active) There were new signs of nut-cracking activity during the fieldwork \nperiod. Shell fragments or nut powder were visible on top of or around tools, and \nthere was at least one hammer and anvil pair with impact points that lacked signs of \nchemical or organic weathering (i.e., rust, moss), or (Inactive) There were no signs \nof recent nut-cracking activity during the entire fieldwork period. Cracked nut ker -\nnels were either absent, or present but showed clear signs of decay. Iron oxide or \nmoss had developed on tool impact points.\nVegetation\nDuring quadrat surveys, we recorded all wild plant species known to be consumed \nby the chimpanzees of Bossou. We then cross-referenced the recorded species with \nthe current list of chimpanzee food resources to identify those which were sources of \nfruit — the preferred food-type of chimpanzees. We considered trees with a DBH ≥ \n5 cm (Hockings et al., 2009), lianas and shrubs with a DBH ≥ 2 cm (Gerwing et al., \n2006), and THV of any dimensions. However, while THV is a frequently consumed \nfood item by the chimpanzees of Bossou (Humle, 2011a), it differs from other wild \nplant foods in that it has a lower calorific value (Bryson-Morrison et  al., 2020) \nand often an individual plant can only be sourced once, after which it is permanently \ndepleted. To distinguish these types of food sources (perennial versus ephemeral), \nTHV was documented as a separate variable. We also encountered a small number \nof domesticated or crop foods that are eaten by chimpanzees. This largely consisted \nof cassava tubers (Manihot esculenta) and banana plants (Musa sp.). While crops \nare frequently consumed by Bossou chimpanzees, especially during the wet season \nwhen wild fruit is scarce, use of these areas is conditioned by additional factors such \nas the high risk of antagonistic interactions with humans (Bryson-Morrison et al., \n2017; Hockings et al., 2009). Such species would therefore warrant allocation to a \nthird vegetation category. However, due to the small sample size of cultivated plants \n(n = 46), we did not include them in the present study.\n892 K. Almeida-Warren et al.\n1 3\nNests\nBecause few nests were documented at the quadrat level or along transects (n = \n4), we conducted additional forest-wide surveys, targeting areas that were known \nnesting locations. When a nest was encountered, we maintained elevation and \ndirection of travel and documented all nests within 50 m of the nest and either \nside of the projected route until no further nests were visible over a 50 m stretch \nin any direction (modified from Hernandez-Aguilar, 2009). We recorded nests of \nall ages, excluding any recent nests that could have been built for daytime resting. \nDay nests are typically smaller and simpler in construction (Koops et al., 2012), but \nare more easily identifiably when most of the leaves are still green. We also only \nsurveyed each area once to ensure nests were not recorded multiple times. For data \nanalysis, nests were divided into spatial clusters. Chimpanzees in Bossou typically \nnest together within 30 m of each other (Humle, 2003). To accommodate variation \nbetween multiple nights, we defined a cluster as a 100-m diameter area with a \nminimum of 21 documented nests, representing a minimum of three sleep-events \nfor the collective chimpanzee population (n = 7) as a proxy for a habitual nesting \nlocation. We achieved this in QGIS (Version 2.18.4), by creating a 50-m buffer zone \naround each nest and using the ‘count points in polygon’ function to identify zones \nwith a minimum of 21 nests. The distance to nearest nest cluster variable used in the \nfollowing analyses was computed with the ‘distance to nearest hub’ function, and \nwas defined as the distance from a quadrat datum to the centre of the nearest nest \ncluster.\nWatercourses\nWe used watercourse data collected by HDC in 2008/2009. HDC traced on foot all \nstreams and rivers large enough for small amounts of water to be drawn year-round \nand recorded them using the track feature on a hand-held GPS device (Garmin Ore-\ngon 700; accuracy = ± 3 m). The distance to nearest river variable used in the fol-\nlowing analyses was computed in QGIS, and was defined as the distance between a \nquadrat datum to the nearest point along the mapped watercourses.\nData analysis\nTool site selection\nOur initial inspection of the data revealed that no nut-cracking occurred in quad-\nrats where oil palms were absent. This is consistent with previous literature describ-\ning that nut-cracking occurs in close proximity to a nut tree (Carvalho et al., 2008). \nWe therefore restricted data analysis to quadrats where an oil palm was present, as \nthe absence of an oil palm would mask the potential effect of the other variables of \ninterest. Additionally, there was very little variation in the number of oil palms in \neach quadrat, with only 15% of oil palm quadrats documented with more than one \n893Landscaping the behavioural ecology of primate stone tool…\n1 3\noil palm — only two of which were quadrats where nut-cracking was present. For \nthis reason, we also did not include the number of oil palms as a predictor. The final \ndataset had a total of 82 quadrats, 40 of which had traces of nut-cracking activity. \nWe used a binomial generalized linear model (GLM; Zuur et al., 2009) with a logit \nlink function to investigate, using quadrat data, the effect of five main predictors \n(raw materials, wild food trees, THV, distance to nearest nest cluster, distance to \nnearest river) on the presence (1) versus absence (0) of a tool site in a given quad-\nrat. We also assessed the effect of more restricted variables including raw materi-\nals within the most common size range for tools (95% of tools. Size class: 3, 4, 5) \nand wild fruit-providing trees — see Electronic Supplementary Material  (ESM1), \nTable S1. Because these constituted subsets of raw materials and wild food-provid-\ning trees respectively, we analysed them under three sub-models (ESM1, Table S2). \nIn the first sub-model we replaced raw materials with the corresponding subset of \nraw materials with size class 3–5. In the second sub-model we substituted wild food-\nproviding trees with the subset formed only of fruit-providing trees. The third sub-\nmodel included raw materials of size class 3–5 and fruit-providing trees instead of \nraw materials and wild food trees. We compared models using the Akaike’s Infor -\nmation Criterion for small sample sizes (AICc; Burnham et al., 2004) as an indicator \nof the best model fit (ESM1, Table S4).\nTool site use\nFrom a total of 361 monitoring observations, only 35 cases of recent nut-cracking \nevents were identified for 17 out of the 25 monitored nut-cracking sites, where nut-\ncracking occurred between 1 and 4 times. Because of single (n = 1) sample sizes for \ntwo and four events, frequency of activity was recoded as “Low” (≤ 2 events; n = \n10) and “High” (> 2 events; n = 7). The small sample size (n = 17) was too small to \njustify a generalized linear (mixed) model [GL(M)M]. Thus, we only use descriptive \nstatistics to examine tool site use and potential differences in the local environment, \nsuch as nut availability, raw materials, wild food trees, distance to nearest nest clus-\nter, and distance to nearest river.\nTool site inactivity\nWe used a binomial GLM with ‘logit’ link to investigate the effect of mean nut avail-\nability, raw materials, and wild food trees on tool-site inactivity. The response vari-\nable included nut-cracking sites that were classified as active (response = 0; n = 24) \nwith those classified as inactive (response = 1; n = 16). The final dataset included 40 \ntool sites. Akin to the model for tool site selection, we also analysed four additional \nsub-models (ESM1, Table S5). In the first sub-model we substituted raw materials \nwith the subset for raw materials of size class 3–5. The second sub-model replaced \nraw materials with tools, which included only the raw materials that were used as \ntools and remain functional. The third and fourth sub-models were largely identi-\ncal to the previous two models, with the wild fruit trees subset replacing its parent \nvariable. We compared these models using the AICc as an indicator of best model fit \n(ESM1, Table S7).\n894 K. Almeida-Warren et al.\n1 3\nGeneral considerations\nWe performed all analyses in R Studio (version 1.1.383; R Studio Team, 2016), \nusing R (version 4.1.0; R Core Team, 2021). Threshold for statistical significance \nwas set to p ≤ 0.05. Data exploration for each GLM considered in tool site selection \nand tool site inactivity, followed the protocol described in Zuur et al. (2010) and did \nnot raise any concerns. We assessed collinearity among the explanatory variables \nfor each model by calculating the variance inflation factors (VIF) using the function \n‘vif’ of the ‘car’ package (Jon Fox & Weisberg, 2011). None of the models indicated \nany multicollinearity issues (Maximum VIF = 1.39, Quinn & Keough, 2002).\nWe performed significance tests for each of the models considered. To assess the \nsignificance of the full models, we ran likelihood ratio tests (LRT) using the ‘anova’ \nfunction which compared each model to a corresponding null model from which all \nfixed effects were excluded (Dobson, 2002). We then tested the significance of main \neffects for each model by systematically dropping them one at a time and comparing \nthe resulting model with the full model using the ‘drop1’ function (Dobson, 2002). \nP-values for the individual effects were based on the LRT results from the ‘drop1’ \nfunction. We verified model assumptions by plotting residuals versus fitted values \nand versus each covariate in the model (Zuur & Ieno, 2016). We also assessed influ-\nential observations by calculating and plotting the Cook’s distance (Smith & War -\nren, 2019); all values were under the recommended threshold of 1, suggesting no \nevidence of influential points (John Fox, 2002; Smith & Warren, 2019). Finally, we \ncalculated the AICc for model comparison using the ‘MuMIn’ package (Bartón, \n2020). We focus our discussion on the model that yielded the lowest AICc, with \nreference to other models where relevant. The full statistical results for these models \nare provided in the ESM1, Tables S2–S7.\nFor tool site use, we computed descriptive statistics for high and low frequency \nnut-cracking activity relative to each variable of interest. This included the mini-\nmum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation, except for variables with non-nor -\nmal distributions for which we report minimum, maximum, median and interquartile \nrange. Normality assumptions were assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test.\nEthical Note\nAll tool site and ecological data were collected when chimpanzees were absent \nfrom the survey locations. Efforts to ensure minimal disturbance of nut-cracking \nsites included: keeping all tools in their original locations, not removing or crack -\ning nuts, and collecting stone samples from existing tool fragments whenever pos-\nsible. To ensure the safety and health of the chimpanzee community, all members \nof the research team wore surgical masks and maintained a distance of at least 10 m \nwhen observing them. Research was conducted in accordance with all the research \nrequirements of the Republic of Guinea, and the ethical protocols set out by The \nUniversity of Oxford, the Kyoto University Primate Research Institute, and the Insti-\ntut de Recherche Environmentale de Bossou (IREB).\n895Landscaping the behavioural ecology of primate stone tool…\n1 3\nData availability  The sour ce code and datasets generated and/or analysed during \nthis study are available at https://\n \ndoi.\n \norg/\n \n10.\n \n5281/\n \nzenodo.\n \n67233\n \n38.\nResults\nTool site selection\nThe sub-model which included the raw material subset of size class 3–5 was the \nbest fitted model according to the AICc (ESM1, Table S4) and had a clear effect on \nthe probability of a nut-cracking site occurring in a location where at least one oil \npalm was present (full–null model comparison, LRT: df = 5, deviance = 56.519, p < \n0.001). Raw materials had a significant positive effect on tool site prediction, as did \nfood trees, while distance to nest cluster had a significant negative effect (Table  I; \nFig. 3). All other fixed effects were non-significant (Table I). The sub-model replac-\ning wild food trees with the fruit trees subset yielded the worst model fit, in which \nfruit trees were not a significant predictor (ESM1 Tables S3–S4).\nTool site use\nOver 15 weeks, only 33 cases of nut-cracking were recorded for 17 out of 25 \nmonitored tool sites. At ten of the 17 sites, we recorded one to two nut-crack -\ning events (low frequency), with the remaining seven showing recent traces \nbetween three and four times during the monitoring period (high frequency). \nIn general, the number of tools was higher at nut-cracking sites that registered \na higher frequency of nut-cracking activity (mean ± SD = 11.429 ± 3.780) than \nat low frequency sites (mean ± SD = 7.100 ± 3.143; Table  II; Fig.  4a). Similar \ndifferences were found for raw materials and the raw material subset of size \nclass 3–5, although in both cases two low frequency sites had over 30 stones \navailable, whereas the highest number recorded at high frequency sites was 19 \n(Table II; Fig. 4b).\nTable I  R esults of the final \nGLM investigating potential \npredictors influencing tool site \nselection by wild chimpanzees \nin Bossou, Guinea.

Low frequency sites ranged similarly \n(min = 0.625, max = 2.000), with only two sites registering a mean nut avail-\nability lower than one. With regard to wild food availability, three out of ten \nlow frequency sites did not have wild food trees nearby, including any that \ncould provide wild fruits (Fig.  4d). For all other sites, the number of wild food \ntrees and wild fruit trees varied similarly across low frequency (mean ± SD = \n4.00 ± 3.916) and high frequency (mean ± SD = 4.286 ± 2.690) nut-cracking \nsites (Table II).\nOn average, high-frequency sites (mean ± SD = 148.714 ± 64.047 m) were \napproximately 100 m nearer to nesting locations than low-frequency sites (mean \n± SD = 245.660 ± 132.760 m; Table  II; Fig. 4e), with all high-frequency sites \nlocated under 250 m of a nesting site. Conversely, six out of ten of low-frequency \nsites were located further away, reaching distances of up to 520 m from the near -\nest nesting location. Distance to the nearest river ranged similarly among low-\nfrequency and high-frequency sites (Table  II). All nut-cracking sites were situ-\nated between 40–300 m of a water course, and in both low and high frequency \ncategories, six sites were less than 150 m away (Fig. 4f).\nTool site inactivity\nOut of the sub-models, the tool subset model yielded the best fit, although the AICc \nfor the tool and fruit trees model was only marginally higher and produced comparable \nFig. 3  Pr obability of encountering a tool site used for nut-cracking by wild chimpanzees in Bossou \n(Guinea) in response to: a raw materials of size class 3–5, b trees that are sourced by chimpanzees for \nfood, c Distance to the nearest nest cluster.

Comparison of the tool subset model with the null model \nwas significant (LRT: df = 3, deviance = 13.198, p = 0.004). Overall, we found that \nlower values of mean nut availability and a lower number of tools were both significant \npredictors of tool site inactivity, while wild food trees had no effect (Fig. 5; Table III). \nHowever, the data distributions suggest that the model is not very robust (Fig. 5).\nDiscussion\nTool site selection\nFrom the initial inspection of the data, it was evident that at least one oil palm, \nspecifically an oil palm in close proximity (within 10 m), is required for nut-\ncracking to occur in a given location. Our results further show that the abundance \nof raw materials and food trees as well as proximity to the nearest nest cluster \nare also important predictors for whether a tool site is established at an oil-palm \nlocation. This suggests that, in addition to the ecological pre-requisites of nut-\ncracking, i.e., a producing oil palm and raw materials for tools, other perennial \nresources that form part of the chimpanzee diet (wild food-providing trees), as \nwell as non-food related activities (sleep sites), are influential in the spatial dis-\ntribution of nut-cracking locations. In contrast, THV had a non-significant effect \non whether tool sites occurred. Food trees are replenishable, often seasonally, and \nconstitute reliable resources that can be returned to regularly. The fact that THV \nTable II  S tatistical summary of tool sites with low frequency (n = 10) and high frequency (n = 7) of wild \nchimpanzee nut-cracking events in Bossou, Guinea.

Almeida-Warren et al.\n1 3\ndid not bear a clear effect on tool site occurrence suggests that ephemeral food \nsources are not ecological drivers of tool site selection.\nMany primate species have goal-orientated foraging trajectories towards spatially \npermanent resources, and it is probable that they use mental maps to guide their \nresource exploitation strategies (Trapanese et al., 2019). Our results provide tenta-\ntive evidence that the chimpanzees of Bossou may behave in a similar way, whereby \nnut-cracking activities take place within a foraging strategy that primarily targets \nperennial, high-value food sources (trees), while low-energy foods such as THV act \nas part of an opportunistic strategy during forage-on-the-go.\nDistance to nearest nest cluster was a significant predictor in all models, whereby \nthe likelihood of a tool site occurring increased with proximity to nest locations. \nResearch at other field sites has found that nest sites occur in areas of high food \navailability (Basabose & Yamagiwa, 2002; Carvalho et al., 2015; Furuichi & Hashi-\nmoto, 2004; Goodall, 1962; Janmaat et al., 2014). Given that nut-cracking sites are \nalso located in areas with a greater number of food providing trees, and bearing in \nmind that the Bossou chimpanzees source oil palms for a range of other resources \n(e.g., fruit, pith, palm heart) and also nest in their crowns (Humle & Matsuzawa, \n2001, 2004; Yamakoshi & Sugiyama, 1995), it is possible that the relationship \nFig. 4  F requency of tool site use by wild chimpanzees in Bossou (Guinea) relative to: a raw materials \nthat have been used as tools, b raw materials of size class 3–5, c mean availability of oil palm nuts, d \nwild trees that are sourced by chimpanzees for food, e distance to nearest nest cluster (km), f distance to \nnearest river (km).

Equally, it \nwould seem, at least in the case of Bossou, that water is neither the sole or pri-\nmary provisioner of stones of tools. Given the proximity of the Bossou and Diécké \nfield sites (approx. 50 km) and their similar climates it is unlikely that this is due \nto differences in aridity or water availability.

Thus, \nthis discrepancy may be connected to the different plant species exploited and their \nrespective ecology and distribution.\nEmerging research on the role and importance of water in shaping primate behav-\niour, adaptations, and landscape use is providing increasing evidence that there are \ndifferences in water-dependence between populations. Rainforest-dwelling apes can \nusually obtain their daily hydration requirements from the food they consume, and \ncan go several days without drinking (Pontzer et al., 2021). However, for primates \nthat live in predominantly arid habitats, water is a critical resource that shapes move-\nment patterns and landscape use (Barton et al., 1992; Lindshield et al., 2021; Pruetz \n& Herzog, 2017). Fongoli chimpanzees in Senegal usually drink water at least once \na day, and often spend time near water sources during dry months to stay cool (Lind-\nshield et al., 2021; Pruetz & Bertolani, 2009). Conversely, the Bossou forest is much \nmore humid, with a long wet season. Its many streams and small forest area provide \na hydrological landscape in which chimpanzees are rarely more than 300 m away \nfrom water. Furthermore, during a total of ~500 hours of focal follows, the Bossou \nchimpanzees were only seen to drink water on eight occasions, suggesting that they \ncan get most of their fluids from the foods they consume, in line with the general \ntrend for non-human apes (Pontzer et al., 2021).\nWhile water was not a significant factor for Bossou, we hypothesize that it could \nbe a major ecological driver regarding the spatial distribution and reuse of tool sites \nby savannah-living chimpanzees. The Fongoli chimpanzees do not crack nuts, but \nthey engage in termite-fishing, which is also a spatially discrete technological activ -\nity tethered to the location of termite mounds (Bogart & Pruetz, 2008, 2011), much \nlike nut-cracking.\nTool site use\nOn average, the number of functional tools was greater at sites with a higher fre-\nquency of nut-cracking events, even though some low-frequency sites had a much \ngreater number of usable stones available overall. This discrepancy could indicate \nthat the visible traces of nut-cracking found on tools act as visual cues for stimu-\nlating further nut-cracking behaviour, and potentially also lead to the transport of \nfurther raw materials for tools to these locations. The repeated use of discrete loca-\ntions through stigmergy — the principle that behavioural traces left in the environ-\nment can stimulate the occurrence of further activity — has been suggested to have \nled to the emergence of persistent places during the Middle Pleistocene (Matthew \nPope et al., 2006; Matthew Pope, 2017; Shaw et al., 2016). Similar hypotheses fea-\nturing local and stimulus enhancement in chimpanzees have also been discussed \nas processes of social learning (e.g., in the development of technical skills; Mus-\ngrave et al., 2020; Tennie et al., 2020; Whiten, 2021), as well as why some plants \nare sourced more intensively than others for the manufacture of termite-fishing tools \n(Almeida-Warren et al., 2017). Conversely, it could indicate that chimpanzees prefer \n901Landscaping the behavioural ecology of primate stone tool…\n1 3\nsites with material that they are already familiar with. Previous, experimentally-\ninduced research in Bossou has demonstrated that chimpanzees reuse hammer–anvil \npairs (tool-sets) more often than others, that there is both group- and individual-level \npreference for certain tool-sets (S. Carvalho et al., 2009), and that chimpanzees are \nselective of the types of materials they use for nut-cracking (Carvalho et al., 2008). \nAnalogous studies on chimpanzee plant technologies suggest similar patterns in the \nselection of materials for termite-fishing, ant-dipping, honey gathering and water \nextraction (Almeida-Warren et  al., 2017; Koops et  al., 2015; Lamon et  al., 2018; \nPascual-Garrido et al., 2012; Pascual-Garrido & Almeida-Warren, 2021).\nDistance to nearest nest cluster also showed a noteworthy difference, whereby the \nfrequency of nut-cracking events was marginally greater at tool sites that were closer \nto nest locations. These results mirror those found for tool-site selection, and offer \nfurther tentative support that active tool sites and their frequency of use is influ-\nenced by their distribution relative to current activity hotspots.\nThe number of wild food and fruit trees was largely the same for all active nut-crack-\ning sites. This suggests that while food-providing trees are good indicators of tool-site \nselection, they may not be good predictors of site use, because the data collected did not \ncapture temporal changes in food availability or frequency of foraging activity. On the \nother hand, nests are temporary features that, on average, rarely preserve for longer than \n6 months in non-savannah environments (Ihobe, 2005; Kamgang et al., 2020; Zamma \n& Makelele, 2012). Therefore, they are a better spatial proxy for recent ranging patterns \nand possibly explain why differences were found for nests, but not for vegetation.\nSome consideration needs to be given to the low number of weekly traces of nut-\ncracking events recorded per tool site during the 15 weeks of monitoring. This is \npartially due to the fact that not all active tool sites were monitored, with a further \nseven traces found through indirect observations at non-monitored sites. Another \ncontributing factor could be that monitoring largely took place during the dry season \nwhen primary foods such as wild fruits are in abundance. Our data indicates that \na minimum of 40 nut-cracking events took place at natural nut-cracking sites dur -\ning the 15-week monitoring period, averaging approximately three events per week, \nwhich may be sufficient for the existing chimpanzee population.\nOut of the nine nut-cracking events we witnessed during group follows, six took \nplace at the outdoor laboratory (Fig. 2). The fact that tools and edible nuts were arti-\nficially guaranteed at this location, contrary to natural nut-cracking sites dependent \non oil palm productivity, could explain why a comparatively higher number of nut-\ncracking events were observed there, similar to patterns recorded by Hockings et al. \n(2009). There is a possibility, therefore, that the experiments being conducted in the \noutdoor laboratory may have detracted chimpanzees from cracking nuts elsewhere.\nNevertheless, due to small sample sizes, we would need more data to test these \nhypotheses, including spatial information of food availability across both dry and \nwet seasons. For future research, it would be important to investigate over a longer \ntimescale whether and how often chimpanzees visited the parts of the forest where \ntool sites are located, and the potential effects of the outdoor laboratory on natural \nbehaviour. This could make use of complementary data from camera traps placed in \nstrategic locations, as full-day focal follows are not permitted in Bossou.\n902 K. Almeida-Warren et al.\n1 3\nTool site inactivity\nUnderstanding the contexts of tool site inactivity is an important step in investigating \nthe conditions required for nut-cracking to occur and persist over time in a particular \nlocation, and the factors that might lead to its abandonment. Our data suggest that \nmean nut availability, used as a proxy for tree productivity, and a high abundance of \ntools are important in maintaining the active status of a nut-cracking site. The latter \nprovides further tentative evidence in support of stigmergy. However, there are clear \nexceptions that appear to not fit the model (Fig. 5), suggesting that other factors that \nwere not considered in the analysis may also be at play.\nThe Bossou forest suffers from a great deal of human activity, particularly slash-\nand-burn agriculture, which leads to frequent and rapid changes in the spatial distri-\nbution of resources and localized vegetation composition (Hockings, 2011). While \noil palms are not cut down during this process and are highly resistant to fire (Yama-\nkoshi, 2011), the changes in the surrounding landscape and the increase in human \npresence may deter chimpanzees from visiting those areas, especially if they are near \nthe forest boundary. Conversely, cultivated land that contains desirable food items \n(e.g., banana, mango, papaya) can often attract chimpanzees (Hockings, 2011), and \nperhaps, under these conditions, the chimpanzees prioritize the prized fruit over nuts \nthat can be found almost anywhere.\nSite inactivity could also be an artefact of population decline, whereby fewer \nresources are sufficient to sustain the entire population. Previous literature has sug-\ngested that the Bossou forest has a carrying capacity for around 20 chimpanzees \n(Sugiyama & Fujita, 2011), so it is possible that the current population may no \nlonger need to depend as highly on nuts to supplement their diets. A future longitu-\ndinal comparison drawing from historical and contemporary data will help investi-\ngate and test this further.\nPerspectives on the formation of hominin technological landscapes\nWhile current evidence suggests that the lithic technologies of early hominins and \nchimpanzees differ in form and function (Arroyo & de la Torre, 2016; Toth et al., \n2006), it is likely they had similar plant-dominated diets supported by invertebrates \nand sporadic meat consumption (Panger et al., 2002). Thus, it is plausible that, like \nchimpanzees, early hominin tool use operated within behavioural landscapes influ-\nenced by localized environmental parameters, where foraging strategies were shaped \nby the distribution and availability of predictable food sources, the dietary depend-\nence on extractive foraging, and the availability of the necessary raw materials, as \nwell as by the location of places for sleeping. With the aid of primate archaeological \ninference, visualizing the spatial distribution of hominin lithic assemblages within \nthis framework will be instrumental in providing crucial insights for reconstructing \nthe patterns of landscape use and resource exploitation.\nThe present study suggests that the technological landscape of the chimpanzees \nof Bossou shares affinities with the ‘favoured places’ model (Schick, 1987; Schick \n903Landscaping the behavioural ecology of primate stone tool…\n1 3\n& Toth, 1993), which proposed that hominin tool sites formed at the centre of for -\naging areas where hominins would process and consume food, rest, and socialize, \nwith sites being used more intensively in areas with higher resource abundance. \nSuch ‘activity hotspots’ would have acted as ecological tethers, shaping early homi-\nnin movement and foraging patterns, which, in turn, would have led to the formation \nand repeated use of tool sites over time. As the most conspicuous evidence of these \nlocations, stone tool assemblages may hold important clues for uncovering behav -\niours beyond those associated to lithic technology, and serve as starting points to \nsearch for traces of other activities, such as sleeping, foraging, and insectivory, that \nare currently extremely rare in the archaeological record.\nAlthough water was not a significant predictor in any of the models in this study, \nevidence from other chimpanzee sites such as Diécké and Fongoli suggests that the \nimportance of water depends both on the environment’s capacity to meet and maintain \nthe chimpanzees’ physiological needs and on the relevance of water for locating other \nresources, such as water-dependent nut trees or raw materials for tools. This is likely \nto have also been the case for early hominins, as evidenced by research that has found \nthat early stone tool sites are spatially linked to water sources, and that this relation-\nship changes in response to environmental shifts as well as anatomical and technologi-\ncal transitions in the hominin record (Rogers et al., 1994). Over time, water-conserva-\ntion adaptations as well as the development of means to transport water (Pontzer et al., \n2021) would have enabled hominins to become less water-depended and range away \nfrom permanent water sources. Nevertheless, water may still have played an important \nrole as a provisioner or aquatic resources (Braun et al., 2010), and as a refuge during \nperiods of extreme seasonality and climatic variation (Joordens et al., 2019). Expand-\ning this research to other chimpanzee field sites and exploring water as a foraging con-\ntext such as for algae- and crab-fishing (Boesch et al., 2017; Koops et al., 2019) will \nshed light on the diverse contexts in which water may shape landscape-scale patterns \nof early hominin behaviour and the strength of its influence.\nThis research draws upon the work of Glynn Isaac (e.g., Isaac, 1981; Isaac et al., 1981; \nIsaac & Harris, 1980) who pioneered the application of landscape-scale approaches to the \nstudy of hominin assemblages, from which the first concrete models of hominin site for-\nmation were developed. Further studies will help guide future human origins research and \nprovide an empirical framework for modelling and testing hypotheses of early hominin \nbehaviour associated to the archaeological record of our earliest ancestors.\nConclusions\nOur results indicate that proximity to a nut tree, an abundance of raw materials and \npredictable resources, as well as proximity to a nesting site are important ecologi-\ncal parameters for the establishment of a nut-cracking site in a given location. Sites \nthat attracted a higher frequency of nut-cracking activity were also closer to a nest \ncluster, which could potentially indicate that nesting sites are important anchors for \nranging and activity patterns. Similarly, sites that attracted more nut-cracking activ -\nity had a greater number of functional tools. The fact that tool availability was also \nsignificantly correlated with tool site inactivity suggests that familiarity of materials \n904 K. Almeida-Warren et al.\n1 3\nused for tools or the visual cues of tool use could be important in the persistence of \nnut-cracking activities once a site has been established. While nut availability varied \nsimilarly among oil palms at active sites, the odds of tool site inactivity were greater \nwhen mean nut availability was low, potentially indicating that a decline in oil palm \nproductivity at nut-cracking sites is a driver of site disuse. Together, our results pos-\ntulate that nut-cracking in Bossou is not only tethered to locations that provide the \nnecessary resources for this activity but is also intimately connected to a broader for-\naging and behavioural landscape that is mediated by the spatiotemporal availability \nof primary target resources, such as food-providing trees, as well as the distribution \nof frequently used nesting locations. These patterns parallel those described by the \n‘favoured places’ model proposed for hominin site formation, thus providing a new \nframework for elucidating early hominin behaviour and landscape use. Preliminary \ncomparisons with other sites regarding the importance of ecological features such \nas the effect of water on tool use and ranging patterns, suggests that the ecology \nof chimpanzee technology is context-specific and should be examined with this in \nmind. Further studies investigating the technological landscapes of other chimpan-\nzee populations, as well as the integration of long-term data, will help better under -\nstand the effect of different environmental and demographic contexts on the factors \ndriving the spatial distribution and reuse of both chimpanzee and hominin tool sites, \nadding further detail to this picture.\nSupplementary Information The online v ersion contains supplementary material available at https://  doi.  \nor\ng/\n \n10.\n \n1007/\n \ns10764-\n \n022-\n \n00305-y.\nAcknowledgements\n W\ne are grateful to Vincent Mamy, Lawe Goigbe, Boniface Zogbila, Gouanou Zog-\nbila, Jules Doré, and Pascal Goumi for support in the field; Dr. Jesse van der Grient and Dr. Alexander \nMielke for statistical advice; Dr. Dora Biro and Dr. Bronwyn Tarr for helpful feedback on the original \nmanuscript; Dr. Kat Koops and one anonymous reviewer for their constructive comments on the submit-\nted manuscript; Dr. Tatyana Humle and Prof. William McGrew for feedback on subsequent revisions.
