  "abstract": "Investigation results of properties characteristic for acoustic emission signals recorded in two selected power oil transformers are presented.Signals were put to the filtration, whereas components coming from partial discharges have been left.The calculations concerned: phase-time characteristics, averaging phase characteristics, averaging short time Fourier transform spectrograms, amplitude distributions of signals, values of acoustic emission descriptor with acronym ADC.On the ground of calculated basic characteristics and maps of ADC descriptor three areas have been selected on lateral walls of transformer tanks.Acoustic emission signals recorded in these areas were analyzed from the point of view how is influence of propagation path on these properties.",
