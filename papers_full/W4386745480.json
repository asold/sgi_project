Language serves as the primary medium for\nconveying psychopathological descriptions of both inner experien ces and observable\nbehaviour. Thus, empirical studies typically assess psychopatholo gy with the help of\nquestionnaires that detect and quantify psychopathological phenomena such as changes in\nperception, thought, emotion, behaviour including language and social interaction.Here,we\npropose a novel approach utilising recently developed large language models (LLMs) (1–3)\nto investigate structure and content of a range of clinical questionnaires. By analysing the\nlanguage used to describe symptoms and syndromes therein, this data-driven approach\noffers an innovative perspective on psychopathology. Employing LLMs alongside empirical\ndata has the potential to focus the process of questionnaire gen eration by efficiently\nidentifying redundant items. Moreover, this integration may improve generalizability across\ndiverse populations, enable intercultural comparisons, and provide insights into the cultural\ninfluencesonpsychopathology.\nLLMs, rooted in deep-learning techniques, representadvancedartificial intelligencesystems\ncapable of processing and generating text (4). Typically, these models undergo training\nusing vast corpora comprising billions of words. Most recent LLMs were built based on a\nspecific architecture called ‘transformer’ (5). This allows for efficient model training due toa\nself-attention mechanismthatcan weighthe importanceofdiffere ntwordsinasequence(5).\nCurrent popular models such as GPT-3 (3), BERT (1) or T5 (6) havedemonstrated high\nperformance across a wider range of tasks encompassing languag e translation, text\nsummarizationand question answering,among others.\nInterestingly, recent research indicates that LLMs can provide information regarding the\nsemantics of text and thus have been suggested to represent substantial aspects of our\nknowledge about the world (7). Words can be represented by multidimensional vectors\n(‘embeddings’) and the semantic similarity of two words can be quantified by the distance\nbetween their vectors (7). It could be shown that similarity judgments derived from word\nembeddings, closely resemble the similarity judgements of human raters (8,9). Moreover,\nsimilarity regarding specific attributes of objects or animals(e.g.size,colour)(9) or similarity\nof emotions (10) can bederivedfromLLMs,too.Finally,ithasbeend emonstrated thatLLMs\ncan detect the emotional content (‘sentiment’) and provide not only coarse-grained (e.g.\npositivevs.negative),butalso fine-grainedemotional character izationsoftext(11).\nWhat is common to all approaches of psychological assessments is that questionnaires\ninclude verbal descriptions of symptoms (e.g.“Ifeltsad anddepressed”).In clinical practice,\nweobserve thatsome symptomscommonlyco-occur whereasothe rsdonot.Theanalysisof\nsuch associations and the details of this low-dimensional structurein dataacquiredwiththe\nhelp of questionnaires is at the core of psychiatric research (12). As an example,\nfactor-analytic approaches suggestlatenttraitsthatgive rise topositive correlationsbetween\nsymptoms. Similarly, unsupervised machine-learning techniques such as clustering can\nidentify groups of patients (12) or symptoms that frequently co- occur (13). This\nlow-dimensional structure is the empirical basis for psychiatric syndromes, diagnoses or\nmore complex taxonomies of psychopathology (14). An alternativeapproachfocusesonthe\n2\nmutual interactions between symptoms and conceptualises psychopathology in network\nmodels(15).\nInterestingly, little is known about how empirical associations in psyc hopathology are\naffected by the way clinical questionnaires are constructed. As an example, the specific\nwording of questionnaire items is critical for the accuracy of the as sessment and all\nsubsequent interpretations. Even in the case of depressivedisorders,questionnairesfor the\nassessment of symptoms show surprisingly little overlap in content (16).Thisisproblematic\nas inconsistent research findings might result from differences be tween patients with\ndepression or - alternatively- fromdifferencesbetweenquestionnairesfor theassessmentof\ndepression. Moreover, it has been argued that two questionnaireitems might correlate\nsimply due to their semantic similarity (e.g. thesimilarityofthewaytheitemsareformulated\nis similar) (17,18). Already over 150 years ago, Galton observed the strong ties between\nlanguage and psychological constructs and formulated the lexical hypothesis (19). This\nsuggests that the efficient description of thought and behaviour is highly relevant for\nsuccessful communication and thus, specific descriptions of personality traits will become\npart of a group’s vocabulary. As an example, consider a person that “is pacing around the\nroom with an intense and restless energy” and a person that “is fidgeting nervously and is\nunable to sit still”. A clinical psychiatristmightstate thatthesebehavioursaresimilar asthey\nfrequently co-occur. Thus, both patients might be described as “agitated”. However, this\nabstraction can be influenced by implicit assumptions of the psychiat rist (e.g. the\npsychiatrist’s belief that these behaviours co-occur). Thus, it hasbeenarguedthatempirical\nfindings regarding psychological constructs represent aspects of the assessing clinician\nrather thantheassessed individual (20,21).\nThese limitations indicate an urgent need for a rigorous and systematic investigation of\nlanguage employed for the description of psychopathology and its r elevance for the\ninterpretation of empirical findings and the structure of psychological constructs in the\ncontext of mental health. In the presentwork,webuildup ontheseideasandaddressthese\npressing issuesbyapplyingLLMstotheanalysisofpsychopathology -relatedquestionnaires.\nPrevious results demonstrate how LLMs allow for the data-driven in vestigation of\npsychological constructs (22,23) by characterising the semantics of various questionnaires\n(24). In such models words can be represented by multidimensionalvectors (‘embeddings’)\nand the semantic similarity of two words can be quantified by the distance between their\nvectors (7). Cutler and Condon applied a similar approach to study empirical ratings from\npersonality questionnaires (24). In their study pairwise similarities o f adjectives were\nextracted from LLMs. The correlational structure of these similarities corresponded strongly\nto ratings from empirical data. Some early work has explored the potential of LLMs to\ninvestigate overlap between scales (25) or between constructs (26). While initial studies\nexist in the area of personality assessment (27,28) or emotion (10), the analysis of the\nsemantic properties ofclinical questionnairesusingLLMshasnotye tbeenappliedtomental\nhealth and psychopathology. Thus, we studied four large-scale data sets to systematically\nexplore to which extent the empirical low-dimensional structure of psychopathology is\nrepresented in these models. To this aim, we extracted pairwise similarities of established\nquestionnaireitemsfromlanguagemodelsandpredicted association sinempirical data.\nMethods\n3\nInvestigated questionnaires for the assessment of psychopathology\nWe investigated four questionnaires: the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS) (29), the\nshort form of the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of FeelingsandExperiences(O-LIFE),the brief\nversion of the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQB) (30) and theAutismSpectrumQuotient(AQ)\n(31). These scales cover a wider range of symptoms including depre ssion, anxiety,\nschizotypal and attenuated psychosis-symptoms and the symptoms associated with autism\nspectrum disorder. Moreover, the questionnairesrangefromscalesthatarebroadlyusedfor\nthe assessment of manifest and sometimes severe clinical symptoms (DASS, AQ) but also\nscales that assess mild or moderate symptoms and traits that mightoccur in the healthy\npopulation or individuals at-risk for psychiatric disorders (O-LIFE, PQB). For each\nquestionnaire,weanalysedempirical datafromlarge cohorts(see Table1).\nThe DASS includes 42 self-reported items (e.g. “I found myself getting upset by quitetrivial\nthings”) from 3 subdomains that are rated on a Likert scale with four levels. We used a\npublicly available data set consisting of n=39755 participants\n(\nhttps://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/,retrieved 1stofJune2022).\nThe short form of the O-LIFE includes 43 self-reported items (e.g. “Does a passing thought\never seemsoreal itfrightensyou?”) from4 subdomainsthatarer atedon abinaryscale(yes\nvs.no).Weusedapubliclyavailabledatasetconsistingofn=11807pa rticipants(32).\nThe PQB (Prodromal Questionnaire- BriefVersion) includes21 self-reporteditems(e.g.“Do\nfamiliar surroundings sometimes seem strange, confusing, threatening or unreal to you?”)\nfrom 4 subdomains (33) that are used to assess psychosis-risk symptoms. Items are rated\non a binary scale (true vs. false) and for each item the resulting distress is rated (distress\nwas not analysed in the present analysis). We analysed a sample of n=1099 healthy\nindividualsfroman undergraduatepopulation(34).\nThe AQ is based on 50 self-reported items (3 subdomains) to measure the expression of\nautistic traits in individuals (e.g. “When I’m reading a story, I find it difficult to work out the\ncharacters’ intentions.”) which are rated on a Likert scale with four levels (Definitely Agree,\nSlightly Agree, Slightly Disagree, Definitely Disagree). In the present analysis, we include\nscores from n=1555 individuals presenting at the diagnostic assessment service for autism\nat the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University Hospital in Cologne\n(Germany).\n4\nDepression, Anxiety and\nStress Scale\nOxford-Liverpool Inventory\nof Feelings and Experiences\n(short form)\nAutism Quotient Prodromal\nQuestionnaire - Brief\nAbbreviation DASS O-LIFE AQ PQB\nSymptom domains Depression,anxiety,stress Psychosis-proneness /\nschizotypy\nAutism-related traits Psychosis-proneness\nSample n=39775\nAge=n.a.\nGender=n.a.\nn=11792\nAge=30.4 years\nMales=27%\nn=1555\nAge=36.5 years\nMales=66%\n1099\nAge=18.7 years\nMales=45%\nSample Population sample Population sample Help-seeking\nsample\nPopulation sample\nNumber of items 42 43 50 21\nResponse format 4-pointLikertscale,\nself-rating\nBinary scale,self-rating 4-pointLikertscale,\nself-rating\nBinaryscale,self-rating\nNumber of subdomains 3 4 3 4\nTable 1:Overviewoftheempirical samplesinvestigated.\nEmbedding of questionnaire items using large language models\nWe employed the state-of-the-art LLMROBERTA (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining\nApproach), which is provided by HuggingFace\n(https://huggingface.co/T-Systems-onsite/cross-en-de-roberta-sentence-transformer). The\nROBERTA model follows a transformer-based architecture, cons isting of a stack of\ntransformer layers. It is trained on a large text corpus (approximately 2.5 TB) using the\nobjectives of predicting masked words or thenextsentence.Thistrainingenablesthemodel\nto incorporate contextual information and generate text embeddings that capture semantic\nmeaning. One notable advantage of the ROBERTA model used in this study is that it has\nbeen fine-tuned through multilingual training, specifically on combined samples in English\nand German. As a result, the model can generate similar sentence embeddings for both\nlanguages(35).\nFor each itemineach questionnaire,theROBERTAmodel can providean embeddingvector\nwith the dimension 1x768. The semantic similarity between two questionnaire items was\ncalculated as the cosine distance between their embedding vectors(fromnowonreferredto\nas semantic embedding, seeFigure1)(8).Inaparallel analysis,wederivedsentiment-based\nsimilarity for eachpair ofquestionnaireitems.Tothisaim,weemployed a setofprobewords\nthat captured distinct categories of self-reported emotional experience. As probe words we\nselected 27 terms that have been identified in a previous study ('admiration', 'adoration',\n'aesthetic appreciation', 'amusement', 'anger', 'anxiety', 'awe', 'awkwardness', 'boredom',\n'calmness', 'confusion', 'craving', 'disgust', 'empathetic pain', 'entrancement', 'excitement',\n'fear', 'horror', 'interest', 'joy', 'nostalgia', 'relief', 'romance', 'sadness', 'satisfaction', 'sexual\ndesire', 'surprise') (36). For each of these probe words, we derived a 1x384 dimensional\nembedding vector using ROBERTA. Then, for each questionnaire item we calculated its\nsimilarity to each probe word based on the cosinedistanceofbothembeddingvectors.This\nprovided a ‘sentiment profile’ for each questionnaire item with 27 values representing the\nrelevance of sentiment dimensions (from now on referred to as thesentiment embedding,\nseeFigure 1).\n5\nStructure of psychopathology: item-pair associations and item clustering\nIn the present work, we investigated two complementary aspects of the structure of\npsychopathology. First, we investigated pairwise associations of questionnaire items in\nempirical dataandtestediftheseassociationscouldbepredictedb yembeddingvectors.For\na specific questionnaire, we first calculated the empirical correlations between each pair of\nitems. In a parallel procedure, the associations between pairs of questionnaire items were\nestimated using (semantic and sentiment) embedding vectors and by using the cosine\nsimilarity as a distance metric. We tested the degree to which empirica l item pair\nassociations related to associations in their (semantic andsentiment-based)embeddings by\nlinear regression analysis. Subsequently, we employed machine-lear ning to generate\nmodels for the prediction of empirical pairwise item associations based onsemantic and\nsentiment embeddings. Here, we implemented a random-forest regression (37) and tuned\nthe following hyperparameters: the maximum depth of each tree (between 2 and 10), the\nratio of candidate variables considered at each split (between 0.5 and 1.0), the number of\nregression trees inthe ensemble(between 500and2000),thepro portionofrandomlydrawn\nobservations (between 0.5 and 1.0) (38).Hyperparameter tuning wasembeddedinanested\ncross-validation scheme with 5 folds in the inner and outer loop and the hyperparameter\nspaces were explored by random search with 20 iterations at each step with the coefficient\nof determination as the optimization target. Model performance in the outer loop was\naggregatedacrossfoldsto estimateaccuracyofpredictionsonu nseendata.\nIn a complementary analysis, we investigated the clustering of questionnaire items and the\ndegree to which this cluster structure could be replicated based on the embedding of\nquestionnaire items. First, we used k-means clustering to assign eachquestionnaireitemto\na varying number of clusters (k=2 to k=10) based on empirical data. The same procedure\nwas applied to (semantic and sentiment) embedding vectors to create clustering solutions.\nSubsequently, the correspondence of the empirical clustering solution and the clustering\nsolution basedon embeddingswastested bycalculatingtheadjusted rand-index(39).\n𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 = 𝑎+𝑏\n𝑎+𝑏+𝑐+𝑑\n𝐴𝑑𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 = 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 − 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥\n𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 − 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥\nFor two cluster solutionsX and Y, a is the number of observations that are in the same\ncluster forX and Y and b is the number of observations that are in differentclustersinboth\nclustering solutions. The variablesc and d represent the number of observationsthatarein\nthe same cluster for onecluster solutionbutin differentclustersfor theother cluster solution.\nThe adjusted rand-index corrects the rand index for the probability that two observations\nshow correspondence of their cluster assignments by chance. In brief, this measure\nquantifies the degree to which two random items show similar cluster membership in two\ndifferent clustering solutions while controlling for the potential that two items occur in the\nsame cluster by chance. Thus, the adjusted rand-index is high if twoitems are assigned to\nthe same cluster in both clustering solutions or to two different clusters in both clustering\nsolutions.\n6\nFigure 1: Overview of the analytic workflow. For each questionnaire empiricaldata from\nstudy samples were obtained. In parallel, semantic embeddings for eachquestionnaireitem\nwere derived from a state-of-the-art large language model (ROB ERTA). A sentiment\nembedding was obtained by comparing the embedding of each questionnaire item with the\nembeddingsofa setofemotional words.\nResults\nRepresentation of empirical item-pair associations in large languagemodels\nOverall, embeddings-based associations correlated significantly with empirical associations\nin all questionnaires (Figure 2) both in the semantic and sentiment domain except for\nsentiment embeddings of autistic traits as measured by the AQ (p=0.162). Highest\ncorrelations were found for semantic embeddings of depression, anxiety and stress\nsymptoms (r=0.57, p<0.001). Except for prodromal symptoms(PQB),semantic embeddings\nshow slightly stronger correspondence to empirical data (r between 0.18 and 0.57) than\nsentiment embeddings(r between0.05and 0.38).\n7\n\nFigure 2:Empirical correlation coefficientsbetweenempirical item-pair associationsand\nassociationsbasedon semantic embedding(upper row) or basedonsentiment embedding\n(lower row).Eachpointrepresentsapair oftwoquestionnaireitem s.Dottedlinesdepict\nperfectcorrelationsofr=1,solidlinesdepictthe estimatedregres sion.\nTable 1:Correlationanalysisoftheassociationbetweenempirical item-pair a ssociations\nand item-pair associationbasedonsemantic embeddingor basedonsentiment embedding\nfor four separate questionnaires.\nIn a subsequent analysis, we trainedmachine-learningmodelsfor the predictionofempirical\nitem-pair associations based on either semantic or sentiment embeddings . For all\ninvestigated questionnaires we obtained high correspondence bet ween predicted and\nempirical item-pair associations for bothsemantic and sentiment embeddings(all p<0.001).\nIn this analysis, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms could be predicted with the\nhighest accuracy (r=0.8 for semantic, r=0.81 forsentiment embeddings).

For these three scales a clear pattern emerged: clustering based on\nsemantic embeddings showed the highest rand-index,sentiment embeddings and random\nclustering showed rand-index values around zero (as expected).This patternwasobserved\nover the range ofinvestigatedmodelscomprisingbetween2and10c lusters.For attenuated\npsychosissymptoms(PQB),no clear pattern emergedandoverall comparablylowvaluesfor\nthe rand-indexwereobtained.\nReplication of established subscales in large language models\nFor each of the investigated questionnaires, there exist establish ed subscales (or\n‘subdomains’) which are indicative of more fine-grained psychopathological concepts. We\ntested to which extent this previously established structure couldbe replicated using the\nempirical data available in the context ofthe presentanalysis,embedding vectors(semantic\nand sentiment embedding) and compared this to randomized data. K-means clusteringwas\nconducted for all items. Agreement of this clustering with the established structure was\nassessed by calculating the clustering error rate. The results indicated a similar pattern for\n9\n\nall four questionnaires with empirical data showing the strongest c orrespondence to\nestablished subdomains (low clustering error rate, Figure 4B) and clustering based on\nrandomised data showing the lowest correspondence (high clustering error rate).Clustering\nbased onsemantic embeddingsshowed error rates thatwerecomparable toempirical data.\nSentiment embeddingsshowed intermediate error rates for the autistic symptoms (AQ) and\nfor schizotypal/psychosis-risk symptoms (O-LIFE) but higher er ror rates for prodromal\nsymptoms (PQB) and depression, stress and anxiety symptoms(DASS) (Figure4,Table3).\nSemantic embeddings showed lower error rates thansentiment embeddings for all four\nquestionnaires(Table3).\nFigure 4:(A) Clusteringconsensusasmeasured bythe adjustedrand-index representing\nthe correspondence ofan empirical clustering solutionofquestionnaire itemsanda\nclusteringsolutionbased on semantic andsentiment embedding(k-meansclusteringwith\nn=200repetitions).(B) Correspondence ofitemclustering based onsemantic embedding\nwithclusteringofitemsbasedonestablishedsubdomains.\nTable 2:Clusteringbased onsemantic andsentiment embeddingcorrespondsto empirical\nclusteringsignificantlyhigher than expectedbychanceacrossfou r questionnairesand\nacrosssolutionsvaryingbetween2and 10number ofclusters.\n10\n\nTable 3:Agreementofclustering basedon embeddingsandempirical data with published\nsubdomainsofall four questionnaireswasquantifiedbythecluster error rate.Clustering\nbased onsemantic andsentiment embeddingscorrespondsto established subdomainsof\nthe questionnairessignificantlybetter thanexpectedbychanceb utsignificantlyworse than\nempirical data.\nDiscussion\nIn the present work, we investigated the representation of the structure of psychopathology\nin LLMs across a range of established clinical questionnaires. Our results indicate that the\nempirical association between two questionnaire items can bepredictedbasedon sentence\nembeddings in a LLM (ROBERTA) with low to moderate accuracy using simple regression\nmodels (r=0.05 to r=0.57) and with moderate to high accuracy using machine-learning\n(r=0.33 to r=0.81). Moreover, clustering of items based onsentence embeddings showed\ncorrespondence not only to clustering based on empirical data but also to previously\nestablished subdomains of the questionnaires. In general, these r esults indicate that\nempirical correlations in clinical questionnaires can to a largeextentbe reconstructed solely\nbased onLLMs.\n11\n\nIn particular, our findingsshowsome variabilitywhen comparingdifferentquestionnairesand\ntheir related psychopathologies and embedding methods. The corr elational analysis\nindicated that empirical correlations of item-pairs could be predicte d best for anxiety,\ndepression and schizotypal symptoms. Similar findings were obtaine d using\nmachine-learning. Interestingly, correlational analysis results depended on the type of\nembeddings: we found a higher correspondence between correlations based on empirical\ndata and correlations based onembeddings whenusing semantic embeddingscomparedto\nsentiment embeddings. However, a similar accuracy in both types was obtained when\nemploying machine-learning. This might indicate that not all dimensionsof thesentiment\nembeddings carry distinctiveinformation andthatthe identificationofrelevant dimensionsby\nthe random forest algorithm might help to improve accuracy. Moreo ver, the superior\nperformance of machine-learningbasedmodelsmightindicatethat embeddings relateto the\nempirical low-level structure in a non-linear way. Interestingly, the empirical correlations\nbetween autistic symptoms as measured with the AQ, could be partlyreconstructed by\nsemantic embeddings but were much worse bysentiment embeddings. This pattern was\npresent in the linear analysis(semantic:r=0.81, sentiment:r=0.05) and themachine-learning\nanalysis (semantic: r=0.58, sentiment: r=0.33). Incontrast,thequestionnairesDASS,OLIFE\nand PQB did not show this discrepancy betweensemantic and sentiment embedding. As\nautism is associated with a high prevalence of alexithymia, it could be hypothesised that\npatients with autism struggle to identify and describe emotions and therefore emotional\nconnotation of questionnaire items does not correspond to empirical data as strong as\nsemanticembedding(40).\nOverall,clustering analysisindicatedresultsinlinewiththe analysisofp airwiseassociations.\nSimilar patterns were obtained when investigating symptoms related to anxiety and\ndepression, autism or schizotypal disorder. For all three questionnaires, the clustering\nsolution basedon semanticembeddingscorrespondedbesttothee mpirical clustering.\nIt might be speculated that our results point to a fundamental difference between semantic\nand sentiment. The former is predominantly “world-related”, objective and deterministic,\nwhile the latter refers to “person-related” inner emotional states, which are inherently\nsubjective and probabilistic. This distinction parallels the dichotomy between ‘things’ and\n‘persons’ in the fields of psychiatry/psychology (41,42) and has gained recent attention due\nto its association with underlying cerebral mechanisms(43).Thesubjective andprobabilistic\nnature of internal emotional states might render sentiment embeddings less well suited to\nrepresentempirical dataofpsychopathological questionnaires.\nOur findings are in accordance with previous publications indicating that word embeddings\nfrom LLMs can encode the similarity of words (9), general medical knowledge(44),emotion\n(10) and personality ratings (24). Here, we extend this line of research tothe fieldofaltered\nstates or deviances of inner experience covered by psychopathology. Even though the\npresent analysis mainly focussed on questionnaires that measure psychopathology, the\ntheory and methodology is applicable to psychological constructs in general including\ncognitions,emotionsor attitudes(45).\nIn research relying on self-rating questionnaires, there is often little control regarding how\nparticipants conduct their ratings.Shallower processingofthequestionnaireitemsduring the\nrating might relyonthe meresemanticaspects.In contrast,deep erprocessingmightrequire\nmore mental effort and include the evaluation ofitemsinthecontextofone’sownbiography\nor past experiences above and beyond the semantic information contained in the items.\n12\nIncreasing fatigue due to lengthy questionnaires might facilitate shallower processing. A\nstrong correspondence of empirical data to semantic similarity scores (e.g. low manifest\nvalidity),mightindicateshallowprocessing(27,46).\nQuestionnaire design guided by sentence embeddings:\nThere are many potential applications for text embeddings to facilitate research in mental\nhealth (24). Typically, the first step in the construction of a clinical instrument is the\ngeneration of questionnaire items which contain text-based descr iptions of\npsychopathological phenomena or mental states experienced bypatients (e.g. thoughts,\nemotions, intentions). It is common practice to reduce such sets of questionnaire items\nbased on preliminary data and statistical procedures by means of f actor-analysis or\nitem-response analysis. Importantly, the initial generation of questionnaire items is often\nbased on the idiosyncratic conceptualisation of individual researchers or psychiatrists, but\nnot on a hypothesis-generating approach usingqualitative data(e.g.contentanalysisoffree\npatient interviews) inasystematicwayleadingto theabductionofhy potheses.Thisfirststep\nof the conceptualization of a questionnaire can potentially influence the low-level\ncorrelational structurewhichislater on identifiedusing thegenerated questionnaire.With the\napplication of LLMs, this step can be implemented more efficiently andcircumventpotential\nsubjective biases. As an example language-based models allow the inve stigation of\nhundreds or thousands of questionnaire items, if necessary. Hence, a large number of\ncandidate items can be screened very efficiently and items with high similarity might be\nconsidered redundant and be excluded. Moreover, sensitivity analysis can be conducted by\nexcludingindividual itemsandassessing theeffectonthecorrelatio nal structure.\nAnother important aspect is the data collection procedure which oc curs during the\ngeneration of a clinical questionnaire. Typically, this is a costly process conducted in larger\npopulations in order to obtain representative samples. However, this process might fail to\ninclude individuals from populations that are ‘hard-to-reach’ due to their geographical\nlocation or socio-economic situation (47). This might limit the generaliz ability of the\ndeveloped questionnaires to specific subsets of the population (48). Moreover, for some\ncountries the generation of sufficient validation samples might be infeasible due to the high\ncosts. In general, the datawhichLLMsarebased onconsistsofte xtthatisunstructured and\ndoes not take a specific corpus describing psychopathologically relevant experiences into\naccount. However, data is substantially larger (e.g. 160 GB in the case of ROBERTA,\nhttps://huggingface.co/roberta-base) compared to empirical data sets of questionnaires and\ncovers a larger proportion of the population.Thus,combining empirical dataand information\nfrom LLMs during the process of generating questionnaires, might improve the\ngeneralizability to all parts of the population. Moreover, the present approach can easily be\nadopted to investigate pairwise item correlations across questionnaires. Asanexample,the\nsemantic similarity between existing and new questionnaires can be quantified in order to\ndecrease redundancyin data gathering(25).Lastly,theapproa ch presented hereoffers new\noptions to study intercultural differences of psychopathology.Notably, there is evidencethat\npsychological concepts such as emotions are shaped by the cultural context (49,50). Thus,\nthe analysis of psychopathology based on LLMs can provide a different angle on the\nanalysisofsuchcultural influences.\nMethodological considerations:\n13\nIt is important to consider that all presented findings depend on the datawhichwasusedto\ngenerate the employed LLM.Thus,using adifferentdatabasemigh taffectthe resultsandall\npotential biases present in the source data might be transferred to the sentence\nembeddings. As an example, previous studies indicated that the frequency of a word in a\ntraining corpus might affect the resulting embedding and measuressuch as word similarity\n(51,52). Moreover, the model architecturewill influencethe subsequentanalysisofsentence\nembeddings. Interestingly, recent advances allow for thesystematicinvestigation ofdifferent\ncorpora and e.g. Hugging Face (huggingface.co) provides access to a large number of\nlanguagebased modelswhichcanbe queriedfor comparativeanalysis .\nAnother important future direction focuses on the procedures whichare employedtoextract\ninformation from language models.Asanexample,thedimensionalityo fembeddingsaffects\nthe performance in downstream language tasks (53). In some cases, embeddings vectors\nhave been shown to contain a correlational structure, and removing this might improve the\nexpressiveness of the embeddings (54,55). Lastly, it has recently been suggested that\nextracting information along dimensional axesofspecificproperties(e.g.large - small,hard-\nsoft) might provide embeddings that are highly relevant for the assessment of real data but\nalsoprovide highlyinterpretable values(9).\nLimitations:\nIt needs to be noted that the cohorts investigated in this study differ with respect to age,\ngender, access (general, help-seeking population) or language (E nglish, German).\nMoreover, the investigated questionnaires differ withrespecttomultiplefeaturessuch asthe\nresponse format (binaryvs.Likert-scale) or thewayitemsarefo rmulatedmightinfluenceour\nresults. As an example, DASS and AQ use a first-person perspective (e.g. “I felt that I\nwas…”) whereas OLIFE and PQ are formulated from a second-person view (“Do you think\nthat you could…”). Despite this heterogeneity, our results indicate that LLM can represent\npsychopathologyacrossarange ofdifferentsamplesandquestio nnaires.\nAnother important aspect of concern for our result is the potential bias present in language\nmodels. Recent studies demonstrate that word embeddings are related to the cultural and\nsocial context of the text corpus they are based on (56). Thus,word embeddings closely\ntrack cultural and social contexts. Any potential bias present inthe training data, might\nsubsequently result in biases of word embeddings, e.g. towards min orities. Moreover,\nlanguage use might differ between males and females (23) and dependonage(57).Lastly,\nthe nuanced terminology developed in psychopathology to describethe inner experience of\npatients is presumably not part of the trainingdata andhencenotatall or underrepresented\nin LLMs. In general, inner experiences frequently take the form ofinner speech but might\nalso occur in experiences thataremore difficultto expressverballysuch asunusual sensory\nexperiences including hallucinations, feelings, inner images, thoughts including delusional\nexperiences, delusional mood or unsymbolized thinking (58). As a consequence, these\naspects of inner experiences are not adequately represented in LLMs and thereforedifficult\nto investigatewithapproachessuchas word embeddings.\nConclusion:\nIn summary, we provide evidence for the representation of the st ructural aspects of\npsychopathology in LLMs. These initial resultsmotivatefurther investigationsofthepotential\n14\nof extracting information from such models to foster innovative research in mental health.\nPotential applications include the generation of novel questionnaires guided by LLMs, the\ngeneration of statistical priors in the investigation of psychologica l concepts and the\nassessmentofpsychopathologyin aspecificcontext(e.g.hard- to-reach populations)(24).\nReferences:\n1.DevlinJ,ChangM-W,LeeK,Toutanova K(2018,October 11):BE RT:Pre-trainingofDeep\nBidirectional Transformersfor LanguageUnderstanding.arXiv [cs.CL].Retrieved from\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805\n2.TouvronH,Lavril T,Izacard G,MartinetX,LachauxM-A,Lacr oixT, et al.(2023,February\n27):LLaMA:Openand EfficientFoundationLanguageModels. arXiv [cs.CL].Retrieved\nfromhttp://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971\n3.Brown TB,Mann B,Ryder N,SubbiahM,KaplanJ,Dhariwal P, et al.(2020,May28):\nLanguageModelsare Few-ShotLearners. arXiv [cs.CL].Retrievedfrom\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165\n4.Liu Y,OttM,Goyal N,DuJ,Joshi M,ChenD, et al.(2019,July26):RoBERTa:ARobustly\nOptimizedBERTPretraining Approach. arXiv [cs.CL].Retrievedfrom\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692\n5.Vaswani A,Shazeer N,Parmar N,UszkoreitJ,JonesL,GomezA N,et al.(2017,June\n12):Attention IsAll You Need.arXiv [cs.CL].Retrieved from\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\n6.Raffel C,Shazeer N,RobertsA,LeeK,NarangS,MatenaM, et al.(2019,October 23):\nExploringtheLimitsofTransfer Learning with aUnifiedText-to-Tex tTransformer. arXiv\n[cs.LG].Retrieved fromhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683\n7.TurneyPD,Pantel P(2010):FromFrequencytoMeaning:Vect or Space Modelsof\nSemantics.jair 37:141–188.\n8.Pereira F,GershmanS,Ritter S,BotvinickM(2016):Acomparat ive evaluationof\noff-the-shelfdistributedsemanticrepresentationsfor modelling behavioural data.Cogn\nNeuropsychol 33:175–190.\n9.GrandG,BlankIA,PereiraF,FedorenkoE(2022):Semanticpro jectionrecoversrich\n15\nhuman knowledgeofmultiple objectfeaturesfromword embeddings.
