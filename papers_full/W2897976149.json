  "abstract": "The mathematical creative thinking is essential for students. The initial test indicated that students' creative thinking ability is still lacking. Treffinger learning model deals with creativity problems. Based on the needs analysis, Treffinger learning instruments was not available. This study aimed at developing and producing valid and practical learning instruments using Treffinger learning model to improve the junior high school students' mathematical creative thinking. It was a developmental research that refers to the ADDIE development model. The results of this study indicated that the learning instruments satisfy the validity requirements and the results of the validity test by validators showed that instruments were valid and based on the agreement among validators results classified as the good category. Its practicality can be seen from the results of the learning implementation (93%). In addition, the results of teacher responses were classified as 'very good.",
