    "abstract": "Objectives Digital tools for decision-support and health records can address the protracted process of guideline adoption at local levels and accelerate countries’ implementation of new health policies and programmes. World Health Organization (WHO) launched the SMART Guidelines approach to support the uptake of clinical, public health, and data recommendations within digital systems. SMART guidelines are a package of tools that include Digital Adaptation Kits (DAKs), which distill WHO guidelines into a format that facilitates translation into digital systems. SMART Guidelines also include reference software applications known as digital modules. Methods This paper details the structured process to inform the adaptation of the WHO antenatal care (ANC) digital module to align with country-specific ANC packages for Zambia and Rwanda using the DAK. Digital landscape assessments were conducted to determine potential integrations between the ANC digital module and existing systems. A multi-stakeholder team consisting of Ministry of Health technical officers representing maternal health, HIV, digital health, and monitoring and evaluation at district and national levels was assembled to review existing guidelines to adapt the DAK. Results The landscape analysis resulted in considerations for integrating the ANC module into the broader digital ecosystems of both countries. Adaptations to the DAK included adding national services not reflected in the generic DAK and modification of decision support logic and indicators. Over 80% of the generic DAK content was consistent with processes for both countries. The adapted DAK will inform the customization of country-specific ANC digital modules. Conclusion Both countries found that coordination between maternal and digital health leads was critical to ensuring requirements were accurately reflected within the ANC digital module. Additionally, DAKs provided a structured process for gathering requirements, reviewing and addressing gaps within existing systems, and aligning clinical content.",
