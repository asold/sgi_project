Chimpanzees and bonobos are our closest living relatives. Whereas \nchimpanzees are renowned for their tool use, bonobos use few tools and none in foraging. We \ninvestigated whether extrinsic (ecological and social opportunities) or intrinsic (predispositions) \ndifferences explain this contrast by comparing chimpanzees at Kalinzu (Uganda) and bonobos at \nWamba (DRC). We assessed ecological opportunities based on availability of resources requiring \ntool use. We examined potential opportunities for social learning in immature apes. Lastly, \nwe investigated predispositions by measuring object manipulation and object play. Extrinsic \nopportunities did not explain the tool use difference, whereas intrinsic predispositions did. \nChimpanzees manipulated and played more with objects than bonobos, despite similar levels of \nsolitary and social play. Selection for increased intrinsic motivation to manipulate objects likely also \nplayed an important role in the evolution of hominin tool use.\nChimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus ) are humans’ closest living relatives and the \ntwo sister species shared a common evolutionary history until about one million years ago 1. Y et, despite \ntheir evolutionary closeness, chimpanzees and bonobos differ in a number of important ways. One of the \nmost striking differences is the discrepancy in the reliance on tool use in wild populations of Pan . The \nuse of tools by our primate relatives can help us to identify the conditions that drove the extraordinary \nexpansion of hominin technology.\nChimpanzees are renowned for their extensive use of tools in a wide variety of contexts, including \nfeeding, self-maintenance and social contexts2. All chimpanzee populations studied in the wild use tools, \nalthough the prevalence of tool use varies significantly across groups 3. The geographic variation in tool \nuse across chimpanzee populations is most parsimoniously explained in terms of culture 3,4. Chimpanzee \ncultural variants include nut cracking, termite fishing and ant dipping.\nBonobos, on the other hand, use surprisingly few tools in the wild and no tool use in feeding has been \nobserved5–7. The use of tools by wild bonobos mainly concerns social contexts, comfort and protection \nfrom the rain. In contrast, most chimpanzee tool use occurs in a foraging context, especially in extract-\ning difficult to obtain foods 8. Previously, the absence of bonobo feeding-tool use has been proposed to \nresult from year-round high food availability 5,9, limiting the necessity for tool use. However, a recent \ncomparison between chimpanzee and bonobo habitat characteristics and fluctuation of fruit production \nfailed to support this hypothesis\n8.\nIn chimpanzees, extrinsic factors, in terms of ecological opportunities for tool use, play an important \nrole in explaining within species differences in tool use 10,11. Chimpanzees and bonobos are allopatric and \nthus inhabit different environments, which raises the possibility that ecological differences may also play \nan important role in explaining between  species tool use differences. Moreover, similar levels of tool use \nin captive chimpanzees and bonobos\n12, kept under similar conditions, suggest that the species difference \nin tool use may be due to differences in extrinsic (ecological or social) opportunities for tool use in the \n1Anthropological Institute and Museum, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, 8057 Zürich, Switzerland. \n2Department of Archaeology & Anthropology, University of Cambridge, Pembroke Street, CB2 3QG Cambridge, \nUnited Kingdom. 3Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Aichi 484-8506, Japan.

Alternatively, chimpanzees and bonobos may differ intrinsically (i.e. not in response to external \nstimuli), in terms of their predisposition, or intrinsic motivation, for tool use.\nWe investigated whether extrinsic (ecological and social opportunities) or intrinsic (predispositions) \ndifferences explain the tool use difference in a comparative study of chimpanzees ( P . t. schweinfurthii) in \nthe Kalinzu Forest (Uganda) and bonobos at Wamba (Democratic Republic of Congo). Chimpanzees at \nKalinzu are known to use sticks to harvest army ants 13, whereas bonobos at Wamba use tools only in a \nnon-feeding context, e.g. twig as a rain hat or branch drag in display 8.\nWe assessed the ecological opportunities for tool use based on the availability of insects requiring \ntools for harvesting (i.e. army ants, Macrotermes), nut trees and stones. Bonobos are exceptionally gregar-\nious, with party sizes exceeding those in chimpanzees 14. We investigated whether or not gregariousness \nreflects close-range social learning opportunities 15,16. We assessed the potential opportunities for social \nlearning based on focal observations of immature chimpanzees and bonobos. We measured time (%) \nspent in close proximity to the mother and to other individuals in feeding and non-feeding contexts, \nthe mean number of individuals in close proximity, and the total number of social partners. Lastly, we \ninvestigated the predisposition for tool use by measuring tool use precursors 17 as observable proxies of \ntool use tendencies, namely object manipulation and object play.\nResults\nEcological opportunities. We recorded two species of army ants at Kalinzu ( D. terrificus, D. wilver -\nthi) and four species at Wamba ( D. opacus, D. rubelus, D. sjoedstedti, D. wilverthi ). Mean ant density at \nKalinzu was 0.50 trails/km, which was not significantly different from 0.80 trails/km at Wamba (T-test: \nt =  − 1.8, df  =  15, P =  0.087). Macrotermes mounds were absent at Kalinzu and one species ( M. muel-\nleri) at 0.2 mounds/ha was recorded at Wamba. Nut trees at Kalinzu consisted of Parinari excelsa at \n0.39 trees/ha. At Wamba, three nut tree species were recorded: Elaeis guineensis (10 trees/ha) , Parinari \nexcelsa (1.1 trees/ha) and Panda oleosa (0.2 trees/ha). Overall nut tree densities did not differ significantly \nbetween Wamba and Kalinzu (T-test: t =  − 2.5, df =  15, P =  0.065). Stones were absent below nut trees at \nboth sites. The spatial distribution of army ants ( n =  189) at Kalinzu overlapped with the chimpanzees’ \nhome range (Fig. 1a). Moreover, ant-dipping sites ( n =  35) were recorded across the chimpanzees’ range \n(Fig. 1a). The distribution of army ant encounters ( n =  55) and Macrotermes mounds (n =  48) at Wamba \nalso overlapped with the two bonobo home ranges (Fig. 1b).\nSocial opportunities. We assessed the social opportunities for learning available to immature chim -\npanzees and bonobos by comparing the proportion of time spent in close proximity to their mothers, \nas well as to other individuals. Bonobos spent more time <2 m from their mother compared to chim -\npanzees (ANCOV A: Species: F 1, 27  =  6.53, P =  0.017, Age: F 1, 27  =  127.6, P <  0.0001), when controlling \nfor age. There was no difference in time spent <2 m from other individuals in a non-feeding context \n(Species: F 1, 26  =  1.31, P =  0.264, Age: F 1, 26  =  2.87, P =  0.102). However, in a feeding context, bonobos \nspent more time <2 m from individuals other than their mother compared to chimpanzees (Species: F 1, \n18 =  13.3, P =  0.002, Age: F 1, 27  =  0.07, P =  0.795). Next, we compared the mean number of individuals \nFigure 1. Distribution of army ants, Macrotermes mounds and ant dipping sites in relation to \nchimpanzee and bonobo follows at Kalinzu and Wamba (maps created using ESRI ArcMap 10.1 and \nLandsat images) (a ) Chimpanzee follows (white lines) with army ant encounters (yellow dots) and ant dip \nsites (red squares) at Kalinzu. ( b) Bonobo follows (white lines) with army ant encounters (yellow dots) and \nMacrotermes termite mounds (blue triangles) at Wamba for E1 group (right) and P group (left).\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScientific  RepoRts  | 5:11356 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11356\nobserved within a 2-m radius. Bonobos had more individuals in close proximity than chimpanzees \n(Species: F 1, 26  =  5.86, P =  0.023, Age: F 1, 26  =  0.002, P =  0.968). Lastly, we compared the number of \nsocial partners. Y oung bonobos had more social partners than young chimpanzees (Species: F1, 26 =  50.5, \nP <  0.0001, Age: F1, 26 =  0.576, P =  0.455), as well as more unrelated social partners (Species: F 1, 26 =  39.1, \nP <  0.0001, Age: F 1, 26 =  0.118, P =  0.734).\nPredispositions. We assessed the predispositions for tool use by comparing object manipulation and \nobject play. The object types manipulated by both species were: leaves, woody vegetation, fruits and \nmoss. In addition, one immature chimpanzee manipulated inedible seeds and one bonobo played with \na bird’s nest. First, we compared object manipulation rates between feeding and resting contexts. None \nof the feeding contexts involved tool use. Object manipulation rates were higher in a resting compared \nto a feeding context in both chimpanzees (Wilcoxon Signed Rank test: z =  2.5, P =  0.013) and bonobos \n(z =  2.5, P =  0.013). Moreover, object manipulation rates were higher in chimpanzees than in bono -\nbos, both for detached objects (Species: F 1, 27 =  15.2, P =  0.001, Age: F 1, 27 =  28.6, P <  0.0001) and for all \nobjects (detached and attached), excluding nest building (Species: F1, 27 =  20.1, P <  0.0001, Age: F1, 27 =  41.6, \nP   <  0.0001, Fig. 2).\nIn addition, we compared object play between young chimpanzees and bonobos. The proportion of \ntime in object play was higher for chimpanzees than for bonobos (Species: F 1, 26  =  5.6, P =  0.026, Age: \nF1, 26  =  30.6, P <  0.0001). This result increased in significance when comparing the proportion of total \nplaytime in object play (Species: F1, 26 =  20.4, P <  0.0001, Age: F1, 26 =  2.5, P =  0.130, Fig. 3). We also com-\npared the proportion of time in solitary and social play. There was no species difference in the proportion \nof time playing alone (F 1, 25 =  0.543, P =  0.468, Age: F 1, 25 =  105.8, P <  0.0001), or together (F 1, 26 =  1.06, \nP =  0.312, Age: F1, 26 =  3.42, P =  0.076). Lastly, we compared different play types (solitary and social, with \nand without objects). The only difference was found in the amount of solitary play with objects: chim -\npanzees played more with objects on their own than bonobos (Mann-Whitney U test: z =  3.3, P =  0.001).\nDiscussion\nWe investigated whether extrinsic or intrinsic differences could explain the remarkably difference in the \nreliance on tools between wild chimpanzees and bonobos. Our findings showed that ecological and social \nopportunities did not explain the species difference in tool use. Predispositions, however, did.\nFigure 2.

No tools were used to capture army ants by bonobos at Wamba. Tool-assisted army ant preda-\ntion has been reported for chimpanzee sites with ant densities much lower than Wamba (0.80 ants/km).  \nFor example, army ant density is 0.08 ants/km at Seringbara, Guinea, and chimpanzees here do  \nuse tools to harvest army ants 10,18. Hence, bonobos at Wamba had sufficient ecological opportunities to \ndip for army ants.\nMacrotermes mounds were absent at Kalinzu. The species recorded at Wamba, M. muelleri, is har -\nvested with tools by chimpanzees at Goualougo, Republic of Congo, and at La Belgique, Cameroon 19. \nMound density at Wamba was 0.2 mounds/ha, which is comparable to densities at Gombe (0.7 mounds/\nha) and Mahale-Belinge (0.1 mounds/ha), two Tanzanian sites where chimpanzees termite fish\n20. Hence, \nWamba bonobos had ample ecological opportunities to fish for termites. We did not asses tool availability \nfor ant dipping and termite fishing, since raw materials for tools have been shown to be abundant in the \nforest of the Congo Basin\n21.\nAt neither Wamba nor Kalinzu did the apes crack nuts using tools. Nut tree availability was more \nvaried in Wamba with four species compared to one at Kalinzu. However, Coula edulis , a high value nut \nand catalyst for cracking of other species 10, was absent at both sites. Moreover, neither at Wamba nor at \nKalinzu did we record stones under nut trees. Chimpanzees crack nuts with wooden hammers in Taï, \nIvory Coast22, but this concerns the softer C. edulis nuts. Hence, ecological opportunities for nut cracking \nwere present at both sites, albeit limited.\nBonobos spent more time in close proximity to their mothers than chimpanzees. There was no species \ndifference in the amount of time spent close to other individuals in a non-feeding context, suggesting that \nparty size differences between the two species did not automatically result in more time in close prox-\nimity to others. However, in a feeding context, bonobos did spend more time in close proximity to other \nindividuals than chimpanzees. These findings confirm higher levels of feeding tolerance in bonobos com-\npared to chimpanzees previously reported for captive apes\n23. In sum, young bonobos had more potential \nopportunities to learn from their mothers, as well as from others when it comes to feeding skills.\nIn addition, young bonobos had more individuals in close proximity, as well as more social partners \nthan chimpanzees. Recent findings on captive apes reported bonobos as less socially tolerant than chim-\npanzees and gorillas, since bonobos had fewer neighbours present during tool use\n24. However, fewer \nneighbours during a tool use task could reflect a lack of interest, rather than a lack of tolerance. Our \nfindings suggest that higher levels of gregariousness and tolerance in bonobos lead to more close-range \nsocial learning opportunities and increased access to a variety of social partners from whom to learn.\nObject manipulation rates were higher in a resting as compared to a feeding context in both species. \nObjects manipulated by immature chimpanzees did not include tools used by adults. In fact, immature \nchimpanzees often manipulated leaves; a material not used by adult Kalinzu chimpanzees in foraging \ntool use. This suggests that object manipulation by immatures was almost certainly not socially induced, \nand thus not simply a result of young individuals emulating adult feeding tool use. The different object \ntypes targeted by immature chimpanzees and bonobos deserve further investigation (Koops et al. under \nreview).\nChimpanzees showed higher rates of object manipulation than bonobos. This difference was apparent \nalready in the youngest individuals observed (<1 yr old), who have experienced relatively few potential \nsocial-learning opportunities. Hence, this further suggests an intrinsic, rather than a directly socially facil-\nitated, difference. Our findings provide the first evidence for a species difference in object-orientedness, \nwhich likely reflects a difference in the predisposition for tool use in Pan .\nWe showed that young chimpanzees and bonobos also differed with regard to object play. Chimpanzees \nplayed more with objects than bonobos. This finding was not a consequence of differences in solitary or \nsocial play. The species difference in object play was caused by a difference in solitary play with  objects, \nwhich was observed more in chimpanzees than in bonobos. These results highlight the important role \nof play in fine-tuning adult behaviours\n25.\nChimpanzees engaged more in object manipulation and object play than bonobos, consistent with \na species difference in the intrinsic motivation for tool use. A similar difference in object manipulation \nwas found between the tool-using New Caledonian crows, Corvus moneduloides , and the non-tool using \ncommon ravens, Corvus corax\n26. In both corvids and apes, the predisposition to manipulate objects \nlikely results from a general increase in object-orientedness, rather than a difference in general cognitive \ncapacity.\nThe question is whether bonobos lost the predisposition for tool use and if so, why ? A recent study \non captive apes using eye-tracking techniques found a species difference in attention bias. Bonobos pay \nmore attention to social cues, whereas chimpanzees pay more attention to the action target object (Kano \net al. under review). Together with our findings this suggests a trade-off between tool use motivation and \nsocial attention. The next step will be to assess predispositions across different populations of chimpan-\nzees and bonobos. If there exists a connection between predispositions and the presence of tool use in \nchimpanzee populations, this would provide evidence for culture-gene co-evolution.\nTo conclude, the tool use dichotomy in Pan  is driven by intrinsic  differences in terms of the motiva-\ntion to interact with objects. Given their close evolutionary relationship with humans, insights into the \ntool use difference in Pan  can help us identify the conditions that drove the evolution of human tech-\nnology. An intrinsic motivation to manipulate objects was likely also selected for in the hominin lineage.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n5\nScientific  RepoRts  | 5:11356 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11356\nMethods\nStudy sites and subjects. The Kalinzu Forest Reserve is located in western Uganda (30° 07’ E, 0° 17’ \nS27;). The forest is classified as medium-altitude moist evergreen forest 28,29. We collected data on imma-\nture members (0.7–7.1 yrs) of the main study community (M-group), which consisted of 97 individuals \n(19 adult males, 29 adult females). Data collection took place during 3 months from December 2012 - \nMarch 2013. The Wamba study site is located in the northern sector of the Luo Scientific Reserve in the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo (research camp: 0° 11’ 08” N, 22° 37’ 58” E\n30;). The habitat comprises \nprimary, old secondary, young secondary and swamp forest31. There are two neighbouring study groups: \nE1-group (31 individuals: 7 adult males, 9 adult females) and P-group (28 individuals: 5 adult males, 7 \nadult females). We collected data on immature members (1.2–6.8 yrs) of both communities. Data col-\nlection took place during 3 months from May - August 2013.\nData collection. To assess the ecological opportunities for tool use, we measured the availability of \narmy ants (Dorylus  spp.), termites (Macrotermes ), nut trees and stones at both study sites. To obtain \ninsect density estimates, we recorded army ants and Macrotermes  mounds along pre-existing transects \nin two consecutive months. Total transect length at Wamba was 22.6 km (n =  5, mean =  4.5, SD =  0.69, \nrange =  3.6–5.0). Total transect length at Kalinzu was 54 km (n =  12, mean =  4.5, SD =  0.61, range =  3.3–\n5.0). To assess insect distribution in relation to ape distribution, we recorded insect encounters all occur -\nrences10,18. In addition, we recorded all fresh ant-dipping sites with tools present. We recorded the GPS \ncoordinates when encountering army ants, ant-dipping sites or occupied Macrotermes  mounds. We \nexamined whether or not the apes were exposed to army ants and Macrotermes  mounds by comparing \nape ranging data (see Behavioural data collection) to GPS locations of insect encounters. We took samples \nof army ants and termites for species identification. In addition, we measured the availability of nut trees \n(i.e. Elaeis guineensis, Coula edulis, Panda oleosa, Parinari excelsa) at both sites along the pre-existing \ntransects. We recorded all nut trees (DBH ≥  10 cm) within 5 m of the transect line. Lastly, we recorded \navailability of stones in a 5-m radius below nut trees.\nBehavioural data collection involved focal animal sampling 32. We collected data on 14 chimpanzees \n(7 males, 7 females) in M-group and 16 bonobos (7 males, 9 females) in E1-group (n =  9) and P-group \n(n =  7) between 0.7–7.1 years old. Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 provide further detailed information \non the focal individuals. At Kalinzu, we collected 109.3 observation hours (mean observation time per \nindividual =  7.9 hours). At Wamba, we collected 210.6 observation hours (mean observation time per \nindividual =  13.2 hours). All focal individuals were followed on at least three different days and observa-\ntion times were balanced for time of day. Focal individuals were followed for 30–120 minutes per follow \n(mean duration: bonobos: 81.7 minutes, chimpanzees: 75.6 minutes). Every two minutes, we recorded the \nfocal animal’s general activity (i.e. feed, rest, move, play, groom) and location (i.e. terrestrial, arboreal). \nPlay was divided into social play  (i.e. play with one or more other individuals) and solitary play  (i.e. \nplay alone). We also recorded the general activity of the focal individual’s mother and of the majority \n(> 50%) of the party members, which provided the behavioural context (i.e. foraging, resting, travelling) \nfor further analyses. To assess the potential social opportunities for tool use, we recorded the identity \nof all individuals present within a 2-m radius from the focal individual every two minutes. In addition, \nfor all social interactions involving the focal individual we noted the identity of the social partner(s) in \norder to obtain a measure of the total number of social partners for each focal individual. To assess the \npredispositions for tool use we used object play and object manipulation as observable proxies of tool use \ntendencies. Object play was defined as all playful manipulation of objects with no apparent goal, includ-\ning repetitive movements. In addition to scoring object play (i.e. 2-minute activity score) we recorded all \nobject manipulation bouts during focal follows. An object manipulation bout was defined as continuous \nmanipulation of the same object with hands, feet or mouth. A new bout was scored when the object(s) \nchanged or when there was a 2 min break in object manipulation. For all object manipulation bouts, we \nnoted type of manipulation, type of object, and whether or not the object was detached. Ranging data \nwere collected continuously during focal follows with a GPS unit (Garmin Map 60CSX).\nStatistical analyses. We tested data for normality using a normal probability plot and a \nKolmogorov-Smirnov test33. All analyses were two-tailed and significance levels were set at 0.05. We \nperformed statistical tests in IBM SPSS version 21.0. To compare the ecological opportunities for tool \nuse between the two sites we analysed the insect and nut tree densities. We compared mean army ant \ndensities and nut tree densities using Mann-Whitney U Tests.\nTo compare the opportunities for social learning between chimpanzees and bonobos we analyzed the \ntime (% observation time) focal individuals spent at a distance of < 2 m from their mother and from \nother individuals in both a non-feeding and a feeding context. We conducted analyses of covariance \n(ANCOV A) with the factor species (chimpanzee versus bonobo), % time < 2 m as the dependent variable, \nand age as the covariate. For the analyses in the feeding context we did a logarithmic transformation to \nobtain a normal distribution, and we excluded individuals with < 50 feeding data points (n =  6 chimpan-\nzees, n =  3 bonobos). We also compared the mean number of individuals observed at < 2 m from focal \nindividuals using an ANCOV A with age as covariate. Lastly, we compared the total number of social \npartners between immature chimpanzees and bonobos by using an ANCOV A with age as covariate. We \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n6\nScientific  RepoRts  | 5:11356 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11356\nhad to exclude one chimpanzee (Ua) from the above analyses, since we had only one data point in which \nan individual other than the mother was at < 2 m.\nTo compare the predispositions for tool use between chimpanzees and bonobos we analyzed object \nplay and object manipulation as observable proxies. First, we compared object manipulation rates (bouts/\nhour) between feeding and resting context for both species with a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Next, we \nconducted analyses of covariance with the factor species (chimpanzee versus  bonobo), object manipu-\nlation rate as the dependent variable, and age as the covariate. For this analysis we did a logarithmic \ntransformation to obtain a normal distribution and homogeneity of variances. We also compared the \namount of object play (% time), solitary play (% time) and social play (% time) between the two species \nusing ANCOV As with age as covariate. We did a square root transformation for object play and a Logit \ntransformation for solitary play to obtain normal distributions and homogeneity of variances. Lastly, we \ncompared play types (solitary play with and without objects and social play with  and without objects) for \nboth chimpanzees and bonobos by using Mann-Whitney U tests. We had to exclude one chimpanzee \n(Ua) from the above analyses, since she did not play with other individuals. We excluded one bonobo \n(Hideko) from the analysis of solitary play, since she did not play alone.\nReferences\n1. Prüfer, K. et al. The bonobo genome compared with the chimpanzee and human genomes.
