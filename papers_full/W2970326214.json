Because APE \ncan be regarded as a sequence -to-sequence prob-\nlem, MT techniques have been previously applied \nto t his task. Subsequently, it is only natural that \nneural APE has been proposed following  the ap-\npearance of neural machine translation (NMT). \nAmong the initial approaches to neural APE, a \nlog-linear combination model (Junczys-Dowmunt \nand Grundkiewicz, 2016) that combines bilingual \n                                                           \n* Both authors equally contributed to this work \nand monolingual translations yielded the best re-\nsults. Since then, In order to leverage information \nfrom both MT outputs (mt) and its corresponding \nsource sentences ( src), a multi -encoder model \n(Libovický et al., 2016 ) based on multi -source \ntranslation (Zoph and Knight, 2016 ) has become \nthe prevalent approach (Bojar et al., 2017 ). Re-\ncently, with the advent of Transformer (Vaswani \net al., 2017 ), most of the participants in the \nWMT18 APE shared task proposed Transformer-\nbased multi-encoder APE mode ls (Chatterjee et \nal., 2018). \nPrevious multi -encoder APE models employ \nseparate encoders for each  input (src, mt), and \ncombine their outputs in various ways: by 1) se-\nquentially applying attention between the hidden \nstate of the decoder and the two outputs (Junczys-\nDowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2018; Shin and Lee, \n2018) or 2) simply concatenating them (Pal et al., \n2018; Tebbifakhr et al., 2018 ). However, these \napproaches seem to overlook one of the key dif-\nferences between general multi-source translation \nand APE. Because the errors mt may contain are \ndependent on the MT system, the encoding pro-\ncess for mt should reflect its relationship with the \nsource sentence. Furthermore, we believe that it \nwould be helpful to incorporate information from \nthe source sentence, which should ideally be er-\nror-free, in addition to the jointly encoded mt in \ngenerating post-edited sentence. \nFrom these points of view, we propose a multi-\nsource APE model by extending Transformer to \ncontain a joint multi-source encoder and a decod-\ner that involves a multi-source attention layer to \ncombine the outputs of the en coder. Apart from \nthat, we apply various teacher -forcing ratios at \ntraining time to alleviate exposure bias. Finally, \nwe ensemble model variants for our submission. \nThe remainder of the paper is organized as fol-\nlows: Section 2 describes our model architecture. \nTransformer-based Automatic Post-Editing Model  \nwith Joint Encoder and Multi-source Attention of Decoder \n \n \nWonKee Lee*, Jaehun Shin*, Jong-hyeok Lee \nDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering, \nPohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Republic of Korea \n{wklee, jaehun.shin, jhlee}@postech.ac.kr \n \n \n \n113\nSection 3 summarizes the experimental results, \nand Section 4 gives the conclusion.  \n2 Model Description \nWe adopt Transformer to the APE problem, which \ntakes multiple inputs (src, mt) to generate a post-\nedited sentence (pe). In the following subsections, \nwe describe our modified encoder and decoder.  \n2.1 Encoder \nThe proposed encoder structure for multi -\nsource inputs, as shown in  Figure 1, is an exten-\nsion of what is introduced in Vaswani et al. (2017) \ndeveloped considering single-source input. Simi-\nlar to recent APE studies, our  encoder receives \ntwo sources: src x = (𝑥1,…,𝑥𝑇𝑥)  and mt y =\n(𝑦1,…,𝑦𝑇𝑦), where 𝑇𝑥  and 𝑇𝑦  denote their se-\nquence lengths respectively, but produce the joint \nrepresentation E𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 = (𝑒1\n𝑗,…,𝑒𝑇𝑦\n𝑗 ), in addition to \nencoded src E𝑠𝑟𝑐 = (𝑒1\n𝑠,…,𝑒𝑇𝑥\n𝑠 ).  \nJoint representation. Unlike previous studies, \nwhich independently encode two input sources \nusing separate encoding modules, we incorporate \nsrc context information into each hidden state of \nmt through the single encoding module, resulting \nin a joint representation of two sources. As shown \nwith the dashed square in Figure 1, jointly repre-\nsented hidden states are obtained from the residu-\nal connection and multi-head attention that takes \n𝐻𝑠𝑟𝑐 ∈ ℝ𝑇𝑥×𝑑  as keys and values and 𝐻𝑚𝑡 ∈\nℝ𝑇𝑦×𝑑 as queries. Therefore, the joint representa-\ntion of each level of the stack (𝑖 = 1,…,𝑁) can be \nexpressed with  MultiHead(Q, K, V) and Lay-\nerNorm described in Vaswani et al. (2017) as fol-\nlows: \n 𝐻𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡\n𝑖 = LayerNorm(𝐻𝑚𝑡\n𝑖 + 𝐶𝑠𝑟𝑐\n𝑖 )   \nwhere \n 𝐶𝑠𝑟𝑐\n𝑖 = MultiHead(𝐻𝑚𝑡\n𝑖 ,𝐻𝑠𝑟𝑐\n𝑖 ,𝐻𝑠𝑟𝑐\n𝑖 ) (1)  \nStack-level attention. When applying attention \nacross source and target, the original Transformer \nonly considers source hidden states retrieved from \nthe final stack , whereas our encoder feeds into \neach attention layer the src embeddings from the \nsame level, as can be seen in (1).  \nMasking option. The self-attention layer that is \nthe first attention layer of the mt encoding module \noptionally includes a future mask, which mimics \nthe general decoding process of MT systems that \ndepends only on previously generated words. We \nconduct experiments ( §3.2) for two cases: with \nand without this option.  \n2.2 Decoder \nOur decoder is an extension of Transformer de-\ncoder, in which the second multi-head attention \nlayer that originally only refers to single -source \n \nFigure 2: The architecture of the decoder \n \nEncoder\nInput \nEmbedding\nMasked\nMulti-Head \nAttention\nAdd & Norm\nFeed \nForward\nAdd & Norm\nMulti-source \nAttention\nSoftmax\nLinear\nOutput\nProbabilities\n×N\npe\n(Shfited right)\nPositional\nEncoding\n \nFigure 1: The architecture of the proposed encoder  \n– the dashed square indicates the joint hidden repre-\nsentation of two sources \n \n-  \nInput \nEmbedding\nMulti-Head \nAttention\nAdd & Norm\nFeed \nForward\nInput \nEmbedding\n(Masked)\nMulti-Head \nAttention\nFeed \nForward\n×N\nsrc mt\nPositional\nEncoding\nMulti-Head \nAttention\nAdd & Norm\nAdd & Norm\nAdd & Norm\nEncoder\n          \nAdd & Norm\n114\nencoder states is replaced with a multi-source at-\ntention layer. Figure 2 shows our decoder archi-\ntecture including the multi-source attention layer \nthat attends to both outputs of the encoder. Fur-\nthermore, we construct two types of the multi-\nsource attention layer by utilizing different strate-\ngies in combining attention over two encoder out-\nput states.  \nMulti-source parallel attention. Figure 3a illus-\ntrates the structure of parallel attention.  The de-\ncoder's hidden state simultaneously attends to  \neach output of the multi-source encoder, followed \nby residual connection, and the results are linearly \ncombined by summing them at the end: \n 𝐻𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙 = 𝐻1 + 𝐻2   \nwhere \n \n𝐻1 = LayerNorm(𝐻𝑝𝑒 + 𝐶𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡) \n𝐻2 = LayerNorm(𝐻𝑝𝑒 + 𝐶𝑠𝑟𝑐) \n𝐶𝐽𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 = MultiHead(𝐻𝑝𝑒,𝐸𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡,𝐸𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡) \n𝐶𝑠𝑟𝑐 = MultiHead(𝐻𝑝𝑒,𝐸𝑠𝑟𝑐,𝐸𝑠𝑟𝑐).  \n \nNote that 𝐻𝑝𝑒 ∈ ℝ𝑇𝑧×𝑑 denotes the hidden states \nfor decoder input pe z = (𝑧1,…,𝑧𝑇𝑧). \nMulti-source sequential attention. As shown in \nFigure 3b, two outputs of the encoder are sequen-\ntially combined with the decoder’s hidden state: \n𝐸𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 and the decoder’s hidden state are first \nassigned to multi-head attention and residual con-\nnection layers, then the same operation is per-\nformed between the result and 𝐸𝑠𝑟𝑐.  \n 𝐻𝑠𝑒𝑞 = LayerNorm(𝐻′ + 𝐶𝑠𝑟𝑐)    \nwhere \n \n𝐻′ = LayerNorm(𝐻𝑝𝑒 + 𝐶𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡) \n𝐶𝑠𝑟𝑐 = MultiHead(𝐻′,𝐸𝑠𝑟𝑐,𝐸𝑠𝑟𝑐) \n𝐶𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 = MultiHead(𝐻𝑝𝑒,𝐸𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡,𝐸𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡).  \n \nThis approach is structurally equivalent to \nJunczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz ( 2018), \nexcept that the encoder states being passed on are \ndifferent. \n3 Experiments \n3.1 Dataset \nWe used the WMT19 official English -German \nAPE dataset (Chatterjee et al., 2018) which con-\nsists of a training and development set. In addition, \nwe adopted the eSCAPE NMT dataset (Negri et \nal., 2018) as additional training data. We extracted \nsentence triplets from the eSCAPE -NMT dataset \naccording to the following criteria, to  which the \nofficial training dataset mostly adheres . Selected \ntriplets have no more than 70 words  in each sen-\ntence, a TER less than or equal to 75, and a recip-\nrocal length ratio within the monolingual pair (mt, \npe) less than 1.4. Table 1 summarizes the statistic \nof the datasets. \n3.2 Training Details \nSettings. We modified the OpenNMT-py (Klein \net al., 2017 ) implementation of Transformer to \nbuild our models. Most hyperparameters such as \nthe dimensionality of hidden states, optimizer set-\ntings, dropout ratio, etc. were copied from the \n“base model” described in Vaswani et al. (2017). \nWe adjusted the warm-up learning steps and batch \nsize per triplets to 18k and ~25k, respectively. For \ndata preprocessing, we employed subword encod-\ning (Kudo, 2018) with 32k shared vocabulary. \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure 3: Illustrations of the multi -source attention \nlayer.

We separated the training \nprocess into two steps: the first phase for training \na generic model, and the second phase to fine -\ntune the model. For the first phase, we trained the \nmodel with a union dataset that is the concatena-\ntion of  eSCAPE-NMT-filtered, and the upsam-\npled official training set by copying 20 times. Af-\nter reaching the convergence point in the first \nphase, we fine-tuned the mod el by running the \nsecond phase using only the official training set.  \nModel variations. In our experiment, we con-\nstructed four types of models in terms of the ex-\nistence of the encoder future mask and the type of \nthe multi-source attention layer in the decoder as \nfollows:  \n Parallel w/ masking  where the model \ninvolves the multi -source parallel atten-\ntion layer with the encoder mask. \n Parallel w/o masking  in which the en-\ncoder mask is excluded from Parallel w/ \nmasking.  \n Sequential w/ masking where the mod-\nel involves the multi -source sequential \nattention layer with the encoder mask. \n Sequential w/o masking  in which the \nencoder mask is  excluded from Seq. w/ \nmasking. \nTeacher-forcing ratio. During training, because \nthe decoder takes as input the target shifted to the \nright, the ground -truth words are passed to the \ndecoder. However, at inference time, the decoder \nconsumes only previously produced output words, \ncausing exposure bias. To overcome this problem, \nwe have empirically adjusted the teacher -forcing \nratio in  the second phase  of training , so that \nteacher-forcing is applied stochastically in such a \nway that given a ratio 𝛼, the greedy decoding \noutput of the previous step is fed into the next \ninput with a probability of 1 − 𝛼. \nEnsemble. To leverage all variants in different \narchitectures and teacher-forcing ratios, we com-\nbined them using an ensemble approach  accord-\ning to the following three criteria: \n Ens_set_1: top-N candidates among  all \nvariants in terms of TER.  \n Ens_set_2: top-N candidates for variant s \nin each architecture, in terms of TER. \n Ens_set_3: two candidates for variants in \neach architecture , achieving the best \nTER and BLEU scores, respectively. \n3.3 Results  \nWe trained a generic model for each of the four \nmodel variations mentioned in §3.2. Then, we \nfine-tuned those models using various teacher-\nforcing ratio s. For evaluation, we use d TER \n(Snover et al., 2006) and BLEU (Papineni et al., \n2002) scores on the WMT official develop ment \ndataset. Table 2 shows the scores of the generic \nand fine-tuned models according to their architec-\ntures and teacher-forcing ratios. The result shows \nthat adjusting teacher-forcing ratio helps improve \nthe post-editing performance of the models. \nTable 3 gives the results of the ensemble mod-\nels. The ensemble models had slightly worse TER \nscores (+0.02 ~ +0.13) than the best TER score in \nthe fine -tuned variants, but better BLEU  scores \n(+0.09 ~ +0.27) than the best BLEU score.

Our primary submission \nachieves improvements of -0.73 in TER and \n+1.49 in BLEU compared to the baseline , and  \nshows better results than the state-of-the-art of the \nlast round with -0.35 in TER and +0.69 in BLEU. \nWhile our primary system ranks second out of 18 \nsystems submitted this year, it shows the highest \nBLEU score. \n4 Conclusion \nIn this paper, we present POSTECH's submissions \nto the WMT19 APE shared task. We propose a \nnew Transformer-based APE model comprising a \njoint multi-source encoder and a decoder with two \ntypes of multi -source attention layers . The pro-\nposed encoder generates a joint representation for \nMT output with optional masking, in addition to \nthe e ncoded source sentence. The proposed de-\ncoder employs two types of multi-source attention \nlayers according to the post-editing strategy. We \nrefine the eSCAPE-NMT dataset and apply two -\nstep training with various teacher -forcing ratios. \nFinally, our ensemble models showed improve-\nments in terms of both TER and BLEU, and out-\nperform not only the baseline but also the best \nmodel from the previous round of the task.  \nReferences \nOndřej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, \nYvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Shujian Huang, \nMatthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, Qun Liu, and \nVarvara Logacheva. 2017.
