  "abstract": "Abstract eHealth tools usage is vital for health care systems and increased significantly after the COVID-19 pandemic, which aggravated mental health issues. This cross-sectional study explored whether sociodemographic characteristics and mental health indices (stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression) were linked to the behavioral intention to use eHealth tools and eHealth tools usage in a representative sample from Poland using a network approach. Measurements were conducted in March 2023 among 1000 participants with a mean age of 42.98 (18–87) years, with 51.50% women. The measures included the behavioral intention to use eHealth tools (BI) based on the UTUAT2; eHealth tool use frequency (use behavior) including ePrescription, eSick leave, eReferral, electronic medical documentation (EMD), Internet Patient Account (IKP), telephone consultation, video consultation, mobile health applications, and private and public health care use; and the PSS-4, GAD-2, and PHQ-2. Furthermore, sociodemographic factors (sex, age, children, relationship status, education, and employment) were included in the research model. Network analysis revealed that mental health indices were weakly related to eHealth tools use. Higher stress was positively linked with mobile health application use but negatively linked to video consultation use. Use of various eHealth tools was intercorrelated. Sociodemographic factors were differentially related to the use of the eight specific eHealth tools. Although mental health indices did not have strong associations in the eHealth tools use network, attention should be given to anxiety levels as the factor with the high expected influence.",

Therefore, it is vital to explore eHealth tools use, the intercorrelations of \neHealth tools use, and the current sociodemographic and mental health characteristics of eHealth users. This will \nallow us to evaluate possible barriers to and facilitators of eHealth tool use in the current postpandemic context.\nA review of sociodemographic factors related to eHealth tools usage showed high complexity and diversity. \nOverall, younger age, higher education level, and living with others were related to more frequent eHealth tool \nuse, regardless of employment status. Furthermore, the results regarding gender and place of residence were \n inconsistent6. On the one hand, research has shown that men are less likely to engage in eHealth tool use than \n women7–11. In contrast, other studies have shown no significant relationship between gender and eHealth tool \n use12–14. People living in rural areas have less access to eHealth tools and worse economic situations but are simul-\ntaneously in urgent need of eHealth tools due to restricted availability of in-person medical  services6. However, \nprevious studies have shown that living in rural versus urban areas does not lead to differences in telemedicine \n use15. Age is negatively linked to eHealth tool use and searches for health-related  information7,12,16–18. During the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, older people used video consultations significantly less frequently than younger  people11,19. \nHowever, some research has shown that there is no significant relation between age and eHealth tool  use20.\nThe literature emphasizes the positive association between employment status and eHealth tool use; however, \nretired participants used eHealth tools in a similar manner to employed  participants21. Little is known about \nhow marital or relationship status are associated with eHealth tool usage, except for living arrangements, with a \nstudy showing that patients with chronic diseases who live with others used eHealth tools more frequently due \nto social support than patients living  alone6. Marital or relationship status should be included in eHealth tool \nuse models, as it is crucial for health  outcomes22.\nAccess to eHealth tools varies by tool type and the sociodemographic characteristics of potential users. \nTherefore, disparities in telemedicine use (e.g., telephone and video consultation) may not be transferable to \npatient portal  use23.\nE-mental health research has expanded and has often focused on remote treatment or smartphone-based \nmental health interventions for depression and anxiety  disorders24–26. However, research on mental health indices \nas characteristics of eHealth users is scarce.\nThe present study\nThis study aimed to identify the network of eHealth tools use frequency in the postpandemic period. We aimed \nto explore the relations between a variety of eHealth tools use (use behavior), behavioral intention for eHealth \ntools use, type of health care use (private, public), sociodemographic characteristics, and mental health indices \n(stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression) of users, using the network analysis approach.\nThe present research was conducted in the Polish context. The COVID-19 epidemic was declared over in \nJuly  202327, and during the data collection period (March 2023), most of the pandemic restrictions had been \nwaved except for the requirement of wearing masks when visiting medical services. It is also vital to note that \nthe majority (88.40%) of Polish citizens have access to the internet, and the number of mobile phones exceeds \nthe population size (127.70% vs. population)28. Therefore, access to eHealth is available in Poland.\nDuring the period of improvements in pandemic severity (May/June 2021), the prevalence rates of perceived \nstress, anxiety, and depression were still high in Poland, at 86.55%, 38.12%, and 42.15%,  respectively29. Although \nperceived stress significantly dropped from a starting point of 90.36% 30, mental health issues were still ubiqui -\ntous. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the relationships among mental health indices, behavioral intention to \nuse eHealth tools and use behavior. However, little is known in this area.\nThe present study was partially based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTUAT)31, \noriginally developed regarding employee acceptance of technology in organizations. This theory was later \nextended (UTUAT2) 32 to use in other contexts. It has already been used to develop a generalized adoption \nmodel for mobile  health33,34. We examined the relationship between behavioral intention to use eHealth tools \nand use behavior, measured by the frequency of use of eight eHealth tools (ePrescription, eSick leave, eRefer -\nral, electronic medical records [EMR], the Internet Patient Account [IKP], phone and video consultations, and \nmobile health applications). The choice of specific eHealth tools was based on the latest review of the Polish \nhealth care  system35. Other than sociodemographic factors established to moderate behavioral intentions, such \nas age and  gender32, a literature review suggested that place of residence (density), education level, relationship \nstatus, living arrangements, presence of children, and employment status should also be added to the model. \nWe expected to find direct relations of sociodemographic factors with behavioral intentions and use behavior. \nIn previous research, an additional psychological factor, quality of life, was included in the model; quality of life \nwas related to use behavior but not to behavior  intention34. Anxiety and depression were important in the model \nbut for acceptance of e-mental health interventions rather than for factors directly related to use  behavior36. Fur-\nthermore, in technology acceptance model research, anxiety often refers to personal safety and privacy related \nto new technology  use37, such as mobile anxiety, technology anxiety, or computer  anxiety38.\nMoreover, we included the frequency of use of private and public health care. Current individual spending \non private health care is constantly increasing. Only one in four Poles has a good opinion of the quality of public \nhealth care. Poles are much more convinced by the private medical  sector39. Some eHealth tools are insepa-\nrable from the public health sector (e.g., IKP); however, some can relate to the private sector (e.g., phone and \nvideo consultations or mobile health applications). Therefore, we aimed to explore relations between the type \nof healthcare sector (public and private) and the use of eHealth tools, as this context has not been investigated \nyet to the authors’ knowledge.\nTherefore, this is the first study to explore the relations between detailed use behavior (measured by the use \nfrequency of eight eHealth tools), behavioral intention to use eHealth tools, mental health indices (perceived \nstress, anxiety, and depression), and a variety of sociodemographic factors (age, gender, place of residence, \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:5173  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55910-z\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\neducation level, relationship status, living arrangements, presence of children, and employment status) using a \nnetwork approach among a representative Polish sample of 1000 adult participants (over 18 years of age). The \nassumptions for the theoretical model for the eHealth tools used in the general population are presented in Fig. 1.\nThe use of the network analysis was due to the explorative character of the research. A network approach can \nbe used to explore the structure of relationships among variables in the absence of a robust theory regarding these \n relationships40. Network models are also increasingly applied in the field of health  psychology41. Furthermore, \na network theory of mental health disorders has been proposed by  Borsboom42, highlighting the role of direct \ninteractions between specific symptoms. However, scale-level mental health indices are also used to explore risk \nand protective factors in the network  approach43. This approach was utilized in our study. A detailed description \nof the network approach is presented in the Methods section.\nResults\nParticipants\nThe sample size was 1000 participants, and the sample was representative of the Polish population. All par -\nticipants signed consent forms and were eligible to participate in the study (over 18 years of age). No answers \nwere omitted. The age ranged from 18 to 87 years, and the median age was 41 years. All participants declared \nthemselves to be women or men. There were more women than men (52%), although this difference was not \nsignificant. Most participants were 35–44 years old (25%) and lived in urban areas (over 20,000 residents) (68%). \nFigure 1.

Most of the participants were married (53%), in a relationship (78%), \nliving with others (89%), and employed (74%) and had children (70%). Since the proportions of married versus \nunmarried participants greatly differed, this variable was excluded from further statistical analysis, and only \nrelationship status was included. Descriptive statistics and Pearson’s χ2 test results are presented in Table 1.\nRegarding eHealth tool use frequency, video consultation was hardly ever used (M  = 0.6, SD = 1.18), while \nePrescription (M = 2.76, SD = 1.72) was the most frequently used tool in the representative sample. Details on \nthe distributions, mean scores, and outliers are shown in Fig. 2.\nDescriptive statistics regarding public and private health care use frequency are presented in Fig. 3.\nDescriptive statistics revealed that the majority of participants scored below the cutoff score for anxiety and \ndepression symptoms. However, most of the research sample had high scores (over 6 points) on the Perceived \nStress Scale (M = 6.73, SD = 3.58). Details are presented in Fig. 4.\nProportions of eHealth tools use, behavioral intention, and mental health conditions \nprevalence\nRegarding eHealth tools usage, the highest proportion of respondents had used at least once ePrescription \n(86.30%), telephone consultation (80.60%), or eReferral (78.00%), although most had never used a video \nTable 1.

All details are presented in the heatmap in Fig.  5. Description of the correlations is presented in the \nSupplementary Materials.\nDifferences according to sociodemographic characteristics\nA Mann‒Whitney U test was performed to evaluate whether eHealth tool and health care use differed according \nto gender, relationship status, living arrangements, presence of children, and employment status.\nWomen used telephone consultations more frequently and less frequently video consultations compared to \nmen. Women also used private health care more often than men. Participants in a romantic relationship more \nfrequently used most eHealth tools and public and private health care and had a higher BI than single par -\nticipants. Participants living with others used eSick leave more frequently than those living alone. Since living \narrangements had a significant but very small difference in only one eHealth tool, this variable was excluded \nfrom further statistical analysis. Participants with children used eHealth tools such as eSick leave, eReferral, \nEMR, and the IKP significantly more often than childless participants. Employment status significantly differ -\nentiated eHealth tools use, health care use, and BI. Employed participants had higher use frequency compared \nto unemployed participants.\nA detailed description of the differences is presented in the Supplementary Materials.\nNetwork analysis\nBased on correlation analysis and group comparisons, variables significantly associated with eHealth tool use \nfrequency were included in the network model. The included variables in the eHealth tools use network model \nwere gender, age, educational level, private and public health care use, and mental health indices. Place of resi -\ndence and living arrangements were excluded from the model. There were 20 nodes, the number of nonzero \nedges was 138/190, and the sparsity was 0.27. The estimated network was interconnected. After controlling for \nall variables in the network, a visualization of relationships (edges) among nodes was generated. The eHealth \ntools use model constructed using the network approach is presented in Fig. 6.\nThe network analysis showed positive relationships between nodes denoting eHealth tools use. However, \nvideo consultation use was inversely related to ePrescription use. The most robust edges of eHealth tool use were \nbetween video consultation and mobile health application use, between EMR and IKP use, between ePrescription \nand eReferral use, and between eReferral and eSick leave use.\nAmong sociodemographic characteristics and frequency of using eHealth tools, the strongest edge was \nbetween employment status and eSick leave use. Age was positively related to ePrescription use but negatively \nrelated to eSick leave use. Lower education level, presence of children, and unemployment were related to public \nhealth care use, while being childless and employed were related to private health care use. Edges associated with \nBI were weak. Male sex, older age, higher education level, and employment were linked to BI. BI was positively \nrelated to ePrescription, IKP , phone consultation, and mobile health app use but negatively related to video \nconsultation use.\nEdges between eHealth tools use and mental health indices were weak. Higher stress was linked to more \nfrequent eSick leave, phone and video consultation use and less frequent use of ePrescription and mobile health \napps. Anxiety symptoms were positively linked to phone consultation use, while higher depression symptoms \nwere associated with more frequent video consultation and mobile health app use. Edges between mental health \nand health care use were also weak. Higher stress was linked to public health care use, while higher anxiety was \nlinked to private health care use frequency. The exact weight matrix is presented in Supplementary Table S1.\nFigure 4.

The highest node strength in the estimated network was observed for \nemployment status, video consultation use, eSick leave use, ePrescription use, and age.\nTable 2.

Anxiety symptoms had the greatest influence, \nand further influential nodes were eHealth tools (mobile health app, phone consultation, IKP , EMR, eReferral, \nand eSick leave use) and the presence of children. Therefore, nodes high in centrality strength differed from \nnodes high in expected influence. Details regarding node centrality are presented in Fig.  7. Additional central-\nity measures (betweenness and closeness) are presented in Supplementary Table S2. Clustering measures per \nvariable are presented in Supplementary Table S3.\nNetwork accuracy\nThe accuracy of the centrality indices, determined using a subset bootstrap of 1000, was very good. Better stabil-\nity is indicated by higher values of centrality estimates. The correlation stability (CS) coefficient was over 0.5. \nDetails regarding the case-dropping bootstrap analysis, which estimated average correlations between centrality \nindices in the total sample and centrality indices in a random subsample, retaining only a certain portion of cases \n(90%-100%), are presented in Fig. 8.\nEdge stability was calculated with 1000 nonparametric bootstrap samples for edge-weight estimation. The \naccuracy of edge weights estimated by 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these estimates showed good stability. \nFigure 5.  Spearman’s rho heatmap.

Edge stability \ndata are presented in Fig. 9.\nDiscussion\nThis was a unique study of eHealth tool use according to sociodemographic characteristics, mental health indices, \ntype of health care, and BI, in a nationally representative sample of 1000 Polish citizens.\nWe showed the prevelance of eHealth tools use and confirmed the theoretical model for the eHealth tools use \nin the general population using network analysis.\nPrevalence of eHealth tools use and type of health care use\nThe most commonly used eHealth tools were ePrescription (86.30%), telephone consultation (80.60%), eReferral \n(78.00%), and the Internet Patient Account (IKP) (75.60%). Approximately half of the participants used eSick \nleave (55.60%), EMR (60.10%), and mobile health applications (50.10%) at least once. The least frequently used \neHealth tool was video consultations (26.10%). Such a high proportion of eHealth tool use (e.g., of ePrescription) \nmay be due to the general increase in eHealth tool availability during the COVID-19  pandemic5.\nNearly half of the participants (47.10%) reported that they had high behavioral intention to use eHealth tools. \nMost of the participants used public (95.80%) and private health care (87.10%), indicating that a public health \ncare system is insufficient.\nPublic health care (95.80%) and private health care (87.10%) were widely used. This means that public health \ncare is insufficient, and patients often used paid services. It can also result from access to paid medical services \nthrough companies as part of the employee benefits package.\nThe prevalence rates of high perceived stress, anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and depression \ncomorbidity symptoms were 64.60%, 34.90%, 34.80%, and 24.50%, respectively. High perceived stress and depres-\nsion symptoms were significantly less prevalent than during the COVID-19 pandemic period in February 2021, \nwhen high perceived stress, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms had prevalence rates of 90.36%, 37.44% \nand 42.83%,  respectively29. In the period of reduced pandemic severity in May/June 2023, the prevalence rates \nFigure 6.

The dichotomized sociodemographic nodes are as follows: Gender (women = 1), Children (presence of \nchildren, yes = 1), RS = relationship status (in a relationship = 1), Education (tertiary education and higher = 1), \nEmployment (employed = 1). Blue edges represent positive relations; red edges represent negative relations. The \nthickness of the edges represents the strength of the relations between the nodes.\n10\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:5173  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55910-z\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nof high perceived stress (86.55%) and depression symptoms (42.15%) were also higher, while that of anxiety was \nsimilar (38.12%)29 to the present study.\nThe significance of differences in sociodemographic factors showed that women used telephone and video \nconsultations and private health care more often than men. Moreover, being in a romantic relationship, having \nchildren, and being employed increased the use of eHealth tools.\nNetwork analysis of eHealth tools use\nThe exploration of the research model revealed that sociodemographic factors were differentially related to \nthe use of the eight specific eHealth tools. Mental health was weakly related to eHealth tool use and BI. Only \nperceived stress was linked to both BI and eHealth tools use. Higher stress was associated with lower BI and \nless frequent mobile health application use but more frequent video consultation use. Conversely, a higher BI \nwas related to more frequent mobile health application use and less frequent video consultation use. The most \ninfluential node in the estimated network was anxiety symptoms. The strongest nodes were age and employment \nstatus, along with video consultation, eSick leave, and ePrescription use.\nBased on the UTUAT  model31,32, we assumed a positive relationship between behavioral intentions and use \nbehavior. Higher behavioral intentions were strongly linked to more frequent ePrescription and IKP use and to \nmore frequent mobile health application and phone consultation use. The positive relationship with eReferral \nwas weak. No such relationship with BI was found for video consultation or eSick leave use. Communication \nregarding eSick leave was between the employer and health care system; thus, eSick leave users were less engaged \nand active in the intentional use of this tool. This might be the reason for the lack of association with BI. However, \nunexpectedly, there was a negative relationship between BI and video consultation use. A higher BI was linked to \nlower video consultation use. This might be due to the lower frequency of use of this eHealth tool in the sample.\nBI was not associated with anxiety and depression symptoms but was negatively linked to stress. Higher \nperceived stress was related to lower BI and lower mobile health application use. Therefore, stress can hinder \nBI and mobile health application use; however, the effect size was small. In contrast, higher stress was linked to \nmore frequent video consultation use, which in turn was linked to lower BI.\nThe use frequency of eHealth tools was positively correlated in the network. The only negative relation was \nbetween the most commonly used tool, ePrescription, and the least commonly used tool, video consultation. Use \nof ePrescription was linked to more frequent use of eSick leave, the IKP , and phone consultations. The strongest \nrelation was between ePrescription and eReferral use. Participants who used video consultation more often also \nFigure 7.  Standardized centrality and expected influence values nodes in the estimated network.

The strongest relationship between eHealth tools was between \nvideo consultation and mobile health application use. We assume that these tools are linked to internet compe-\ntency/literacy. Mobile health application usage was also linked to more frequent EMR usage. Frequent eSick leave \nuse was linked to eReferral and EMR use. Additionally, eReferral use was linked to more frequent EMR, IKP , \nand telephone consultation use. The more frequently participants used EMRs, the more often they used the IKP . \nWithin the eHealth tools network, the most interconnected tools (5 edges each) were ePrescription, eReferral, \nand EMR use. Therefore, these eHealth tools are crucial for the use of other eHealth tools.\nThe relationship between mental health and eHealth tools use frequency was positive but weak. Higher stress \nand depression symptoms were linked to more frequent video consultation use. This may be due to the perceived \nurgency of the need and search for (virtual) in-person contact. Video consultation, even though the least popular \neHealth tool, most closely approximates in-person contact, as it contains verbal and nonverbal communication. \nOn the other hand, depression symptoms were related to more frequent mobile health application use. Anxiety \nsymptoms were linked to more frequent telephone consultations and private health care use. Overall, worse \nmental health was associated with more frequent usage of some medical services and therefore with pro-health \nbehaviors. The small effect sizes might be due to missed behaviors of participants with mental health issues. \nNevertheless, these participants more frequently chose eHealth tools relating to human interaction.\nThe relationships between sociodemographic characteristics with eHealth tools use were diverse. More fre -\nquent use of ePrescription was linked to older age and unemployment. This means that ePrescription, as the most \nwidely used eHealth tool (along with telephone consultation), is easily accessible to older people and, therefore, \nwidely used. This contrasts with previous  findings7,12,16–18. On the other hand, ePrescription use does not require \neHealth literacy and, thus, is also more accessible for older users.\neSick leave was commonly used by younger and employed people, as it is a tool related to employment status. \neReferral, which involves the need to visit a specialist, was weakly related to sociodemographic factors. Older \nand more educated participants with children more frequently used eReferral, but those relationships were very \nweak. However, eReferral was also related to retirement. In this case, it could refer to participants who did not \nwork due to age. The relationships of sociodemographic factors with EMR and IKP use were very weak. Gender \nwas linked to telephone and video consultation use. Women more often used phone consultations but less fre -\nquently used video consultations than men. These findings are in line with previous research on technology use. \nWomen tend to choose interpersonal  communication46,47 but are less eager to show their appearance  online48.\nFigure 8.

Our research showed only one very small difference in eSick leave use, with people living \nalone using this eHealth tool less frequently than those living with others. This lack of difference might be due \nFigure 9.  Representation of robustness and stability of the edge weight estimates.

Relationship status was hardly related to eHealth tool use, with participants in a \nrelationship using only one tool (EMR) more often than single participants. There were significant differences in \neHealth tools use due to relationship status; however, after controlling for all other nodes in the network analysis, \nthere were no other important edges. Relationship status indirectly influenced eHealth tools use via gender and \neducation level. Having children was negatively linked to ePrescription use. However, parents more often used \neSick leave and eReferral than childless participants.\nThe lack of significant relationships between residential population density and eHealth tool use indicates that \nbarriers to access significantly diminished. The majority of participants used eHealth tools regardless of place of \nresidence, showing that there was equal access to eHealth tool use. A fast increase in internet users, even after \nthe pandemic (an increase of 8.5% from 2022 to 2023)28, might explain the widespread use of eHealth tools and \nreduction of barriers in rural areas.\nNetwork analysis showed that unemployed and retired participants used public health care more, while \nemployed participants used private health care more. Participants using public health care more often were less \neducated and had children, while use of paid health services was linked to higher education and being childless.\nFurthermore, women were more likely to use private health care, while there was no relationship between \ngender and public health care use. Therefore, women were more interested in medical service use, particularly \nfor additionally paid services. Furthermore, participants using public health services more often used ePrescrip-\ntion, phone consultations, and video consultations. Additionally, private health users more often used video \nconsultations.\nThe strongest nodes in the network were age and employment status, along with video consultation, eSick \nleave, and ePrescription use. However, when analyzing expected influence, anxiety symptoms turned out to be \nthe most influential node, along with the presence of children and eHealth tool use (mobile health app, phone \nconsultation, IKP , EMR, eReferral, eSick leave use). It seems that the most popular eHealth tool (ePrescription) \nwas not influential in the network. However, the presence of children was important in terms of eHealth tools \nuse. Additionally, anxiety symptoms were the most important factor.\nThere are several limitations to this study. The study had a cross-sectional design, and all variables were \nmeasured at only one time point. Additionally, all measurements were based on self-assessments. Indices of \nphysical health and economic status were not included. The UTUAT2 model was only partially referenced. The \nstudy was conducted in a specific Polish context. Future research should incorporate the full UTUAT2 model, \nincluding predictors of behavioral intentions (e.g., performance expectancy, effort expectancy), in an interna -\ntional longitudinal study design.\nConclusions\nWhen exploring eHealth, the particular eHealth tool type should be specified. Different eHealth tools are related \nto a variety of factors. Except for age, sociodemographic factors were not strongly related to eHealth tools use \nfrequency. That means that social barriers to eHealth use are diminishing. The positive relationship between \nbehavioral intentions and use behavior was confirmed for all eHealth tools, except video consultations and eSick \nleave. Although mental health indices were not strongly influential in the eHealth tool use network, attention \nshould be given to anxiety levels as the factor with the highest expected influence.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis online cross-sectional study was conducted on 13–14 March 2023 among a nationally representative sample \nof 1000 Polish citizens over 18 years old. The data were collected by the Clinical Research Organization BioStat. \nThe mean time to complete the survey was 9 min and 33 s. The participants were enrolled in a reward system \n(prizes). Each participant was given 40 points. There was an opportunity to exchange points for money after \ncollecting 1000 points. The invitation to the study was sent to 130,239 users, and the first 1000 participants who \nmet the representativity requirements (gender, place of residence, employment status) and inclusion criteria \n(over 18 years of age) were enrolled.\nEthics statement\nThe study protocol was approved by the University Research Committee at the Lublin University of Technology, \nPoland, Decision No. 1/2023. The study followed the ethical requirements of anonymity and voluntariness of \nparticipation. Each person provided written informed consent. Following the Declaration of Helsinki, written \ninformed consent was obtained from each participant before inclusion. All methods were carried out in accord-\nance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical analyses were performed using JASP 0.17.2.149 (common method bias, correlation heatmap, net-\nwork analysis), IBM SPSS  2850 (chi-square test, normality tests), and jamovi 2.251 (descriptive statistics). A chi-\nsquare (χ2) test was performed for frequencies in all variables. The graphical inspection of descriptive statistics \nand tests of normality (Kolmogorov‒Smirnov and Shapiro‒Wilk) showed that no continuous variables met the \nrequirements for normality of distribution. All eHealth tools use frequency indices were coded as categorical \nvariables for the χ2 test. The original scale ranged from 0 = never used to 5 = very often used. The coded scale was \n0 = never used and 1 = used (originally values from 1 to 5). Health care use frequency (private or public) was origi-\nnally scored from 1 = never used to 5 = very often used was recoded as 0 = never used and 1 = used (originally 2–5). \nBehavioral intention to use eHealth tools was recoded based on the mean (11), denoting results under the mean \nas 0 = low and those over the mean as 1  = high. The GAD-2 and PHQ-2 scores were recoded with cutoff scores \n14\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:5173  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55910-z\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nequal to or above  1052,53, where 0 = no and 1 = yes in terms of the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms, \nrespectively. There is no cutoff score for the PSS-454, but the recommended level for high perceived stress is 6 to \n 1655. The PSS-4 scores were recoded as 0 = low and 1 = high based on recommended values.\nThe next step was performing the network analysis. The Spearman’s rho  heatmap was generated to show \ncorrelations between continuous variables. The Mann‒Whitney U test was performed to assess differences in \neHealth tool use, health care use, and BI. The effect size r was calculated with the formula: z/√(N). According to \n Cohen56, r values above 0.1 can be described as small, values above 0.3 can be described as moderate, and values \nabove 0.5 can be described as large.\nNext, network analysis was performed. Network analysis is a unique method used to explore complex systems \ncombining environmental, behavioral, and psychological data. We assumed a mutualistic model. A network is a \nsystem that consists of nodes (visually represented by circles) connected by edges (lines) that reflect the strength \nof the relationship between nodes, typically after controlling for all variables in the  network57. Blue edges repre-\nsent positive associations, while red edges represent negative associations. The thickness and saturation of the \nedges represent the strength of the relations between the nodes.\nNetwork analysis can indicate centrality measures (betweenness, closeness, and strength). The indices are \nshown as standardized z scores. However, the centrality measurement is debated and faces strong criticism \ndue to conceptual ambiguity and its adjustment in psychological  networks58,59. In particular, betweenness and \ncloseness centrality are incompatible as measures of node  importance59. These two centrality measures are based \non (absolute) conditional associations and do not represent physical distances, which violates the principle of \n transitivity40. However, even though the centrality measures indicate the importance of nodes to the estimated \nnetwork, peripheral nodes may also be important in shaping system  behavior60. Furthermore, a new centrality \nmeasurement, expected influence (EI), has been recommended as a more accurate measure, as it includes nega-\ntive associations among  nodes45. Expected influence successfully predicted how strongly changes in nodes were \nassociated with changes in the remaining nodes, with higher values reflecting greater node centrality/influence61. \nCentrality strength is defined as the sum of the absolute value of all  edges62. Therefore, centrality strength and \nexpected influence were used in this network analysis. The remaining centrality measures, betweenness and \ncloseness, are presented in the Supplementary Materials.\nThe estimator was EBICglasso with the extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC) tuning parameter \nat the recommended value of 0.5 to compute a sparse Gaussian graphical model (GGM) with graphical  lasso63. \nAll 20 continuous, ordinal and binary variables were included in the model. Network analysis was weighted, \nsigned, and estimated with (penalized) maximum likelihood  estimation64. Centrality stability was calculated \nto assess the degree to which centrality estimates were subject to sampling error. The accuracy of the centrality \nindices was determined with 1000 bootstrap samples. The correlation stability (CS) coefficient should not be \nbelow 0.25 and preferably should be above 0.5. Edge stability was investigated using subset bootstrapping. The \nnumber of bootstraps was 1000, and bootstrap-type nonparametric data can be applied to continuous, catego -\nrial and ordinal  data65.\nSample size\nG*Power66 was utilized to calculate an appropriate sample size. For the χ 2 test of independence, the following \nparameters were used: two-tailed test, effect size of 1.5, alpha of 0.05, 95% power and proportion of discordant \npairs of 0.30. The minimum sample size was determined to be 148. For network analysis, the larger the sample \nsize is, the more stable and accurate the networks estimated. However, predicting network structure and edge \nweights is difficult, as little evidence exists for a priori power analysis  guidance67. For structural equation mod-\neling (SEM) analysis as used for common method bias, the adequate total sample size has to exceed 300  people68.\nSample size was calculated based on a 99% confidence level, standard deviation of 0.5, and confidence interval \n(margin of error) of 4.08 from the population of Polish citizens (38,000,000). The calculated sample size was \n1000. Therefore, we decided to conduct a representative study among a population of 1000 participants in terms \nof age, gender, and employment status to enable generalization of results.\nCommon method bias\nTo prevent common method bias (CMB), several procedures were implemented in terms of study design and \ndata collect, e.g., different scales, mixed order of survey questions, and relatively short survey length (data col -\nlection time less than 10 min). Furthermore, the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample reflected Pol -\nish population diversification. However, all measurements were captured by the same response method at the \nsame time point, which can be a source of  CMB69. Therefore, to verify whether CMB significantly affected the \nstudy variables, we performed Harman’s single-factor test. All items ( N = 23) were included in the exploratory \nfactor analysis (EFA) with one fixed factor, a principal axis factoring extraction method and no rotation. The \ntotal variance explained was 23.87%, which is less than the threshold of 50% 69. This indicates that there was no \nbias. However, this method is increasingly  criticized70,71. Therefore, we evaluated common method bias using \na common latent factor, which is proposed to be a more appropriate  method72. Structural equation modeling \n(SEM) was performed with and without the common latent factor (CFL). The following step involved comparing \nstandardized regression weights in those two models. The comparison did not reveal any significant differences \nbetween the model without CFL and with CFL, above 0.2. No items were affected by common method bias. \nTherefore, the research data were free of common method bias.\nMeasurements\nRegarding BI, the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2)32 within the eHealth \n context33 was employed. However, instead of “mobile health” , we used “eHealth tools” . We added an introduction \n15\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:5173  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55910-z\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nto ensure that the participants understood the notion of the eHealth tools: “eHealth is health care practice sup-\nported by electronic processes and communications. The e-health tools include: ePrescription, eSick leave, eRe-\nferral, electronic medical documentation (EMD), the Internet Patient Account (IKP), remote medical care and \ne-consultations (e.g., telephone consultations or video consultations), and mobile health applications. ” The BI \nscale consists of three items evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale, varying from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly \nagree. The BI scale ranged from 3 to 15. The Cronbach’s α for this study was high (0.92).\nThe description of the eHealth Tools used in our research is presented below. An ePrescription is an electronic \ndocument replacing a prescription paper. An ePrescription can be redeemed based on a 4-digit code associ-\nated with the PESEL number of the patient to whom the ePrescription is issued. An eSick leave has replaced \nthe traditional certificate issued in paper form by a doctor. As a result of introducing this functionality, the rest \nis automatically delivered to the employer and Social Security. An eReferral is another element of digitizing \nhealth care and digitizing documentation of the diagnostic and therapeutic process. Thanks to its introduction, \nthe process of issuing a referral has been improved by eliminating potential errors (the system verifies the cor -\nrectness of the e-referral) and enabling the patient to make an appointment independently. Electronic medical \ndocumentation (EMD) is created electronically with an appropriate electronic signature. An account is set up \non an online platform that allows each patient to use specific digital services and collect certain medical data \nof a particular patient. The Internet Patient Account (IKP) stores and gives access to data medical information \nto the account holder or authorized person, allowing you to take care of some activities without leaving your \nhome. Phone and video consultations are health services provided at a distance using electronic or communica-\ntion systems. Mobile health applications include solutions for electronic appointments and checking test results, \napplications for operating medical devices (e.g., blood pressure monitor or insulin pump), or simply applications \nfor monitoring a healthy  lifestyle35.\neHealth tool use frequency was measured separately for each of eight tools: ePrescription, eSick leave, eRefer-\nral, electronic medical documentation (EMD), the Internet Patient Account (IKP), telephone consultation, video \nconsultation, and mobile health applications, on a scale from 0 = never to 5 = very often. This selection of eHealth \ntools reflected the Polish context and was based on a review of the Polish health care  system35.\nHealth care use frequency was assessed for public and private health care use on a scale ranging from 1 = never \nto 5 = very often. eHealth tool use and private/public health care use frequency were denoted as use behavior in \nthe UTAUT2  model32.\nThe 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4)54,73 was utilized to evaluate perceived stress during the last month. \nThe items are evaluated on a scale from 0 = never to 4 = very often. PSS-4 scores range from 0 to 16. The scale’s \nreliability in this study was very good, with Cronbach’s α = 0.73.\nThe 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2) 52 was utilized for anxiety assessment, while the \n2-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ2)53 was utilized for depression assessment. The items are evaluated \non scales from 0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day. Each scale ranges from 0 to 6. Although the measurements are \nused worldwide and have been  validated52,53, the internal consistency was low for anxiety and depression symp-\ntoms, and Cronbach’s α was 0.56 and 0.63 in this study, respectively, probably due to the shortening of the scales.\nThe sociodemographic survey included gender, age, education level, place of residence, relationship status \n(in a relationship vs. single), presence of children, living arrangements (living with others vs. living alone), and \nemployment status.\nData availability\nThe measurements and the database are accessible at the Centre for Open Science  OSF74.\nReceived: 17 August 2023; Accepted: 28 February 2024\nReferences\n 1.
