  "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), of which ChatGPT is an exemplary tool, is beginning to revolutionize the way people search for information and use the information they acquire in their personal and professional lives. ChatGPT is showing a strong track record in a variety of tasks, such as generating text, summarizing text and answering questions during a conversation. It has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of fields - including education. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the extent to which the ChatGPT language model can be applied in the learning process for two types of students: full-time and part-time. Additionally, this article assesses the level of students' familiarity with intelligent chat functionality and their ability to construct queries directed to it. The study found that the use of an advanced language model based on artificial intelligence is more beneficial for full-time students in the learning process. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the knowledge of intelligent chat functionality and the ability to construct queries directed to it between full-time and part-time students.",
