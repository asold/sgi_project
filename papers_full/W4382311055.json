INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, for Renewable Energy Sources (RES) applica-\ntions, there has been special attention to increasing efﬁciency\nand obtaining higher power density of high-voltage gain DC-\nDC converters [1]. These converters act as an interfacing\ncircuit to boost the low input DC voltage(typically 20-40 V)\nto the demanded regulated high output DC voltage (380-400\nVDC) for providing acceptable ac utility voltage. High voltage\ngain DC-DC converters are also required for various applica-\ntions like robotics, UPS, automobile HID lamps, data center,\nsatellite, appliances, medical devices, motor drive, and server\npower supplies[1], [2].\nHigh-voltage gain ratio and continuous input current are\nthe primary critical requirements for RES applications[1],\n[3]. For low-power applications, the non-isolated type of high\nstep-up converters with the common ground between input\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

So far, many\ntransformer-less DC-DC converters with the help of boost-\ning techniques like voltage multipliers, switched capacitors,\nswitched inductors, and cascading connections have been pro-\nposed to enhance the voltage gain[1]. However, the ultra-high\nvoltage gains of these modiﬁed structures are often achieved\nby using more power stages and more components, with in-\ncreased cost, complexity, and conduction losses[6].\nTo further improve the key indicators of the high step-up\nDC-DC converters such as voltage gain ratio, components\ncount, and efﬁciency, many topologies based on the trans-\nformer (isolated or built-in) and Couple-Inductor (CI) have\nbeen developed[7], [8]. In these circuits, the magnetic devices\nalong with other voltage-boosting methods are employed un-\nder different conﬁgurations of step-up topologies[9]. Here,\nthe turns ratio of the transformer or CI helps to further increase\nthe voltage gain ratio with fewer components. However, a con-\nsiderable voltage spike on the main power switches under high\nturns ratio caused by the leakage inductance of the magnetic\ndevice is a serious issue with the use of CI or transformer,\nwhich can be limited using clamp circuits (active or pas-\nsive) [5], [10]. Also, in high-voltage gain DC-DC converters,\nhard-switching performance and diode reverse recovery often\nhave a negative effect on the conversion efﬁciency. To solve\nthis problem, the operation of the circuit under soft-switching\nusing Zero V oltage Switching (ZVS) or Zero Current Switch-\ning (ZCS) is highly recommended to improve the converter\nperformance and power density[8], [11].\nIn the last two decades, many non-isolated high step-up\nDC-DC structures using CI (two or three winding) com-\nbined with other boosting methods (VM, SC, or SI) with\nproper performance have been presented. In[11], [12], [13],\ntwo-winding CI along with VMs are utilized to raise the\nvoltage gain ratio. Despite an ultra-high voltage conversion\nratio along with soft-switching performance, these converters\nsuffer from a high input current ripple, which is accounted\nas the main disadvantage of the proposed converter. To solve\nthe aforementioned problems, new types of high-voltage gain\nconverters with continuous input current have been introduced\n[14], [15], [16], [17]. In these converters, the single power\nswitch operates under turn-ON ZCS transition with low volt-\nage stress. Besides, the leakage inductor energy of the CI\nis absorbed with help of a regenerative passive clamp cir-\ncuit. However, in these converters, a wide range of voltage\nconversion ratios cannot be provided. Also, a new type of\nultra high-gain DC-DC converter with low input current ripple\nusing a three-winding coupled-inductor is suggested in[18].\nNevertheless, using many semiconductor components is the\nmain disadvantage of this converter.\nIn [19], [20], [21], high step-up DC-DC converters with\nactive clamp circuits have been presented to provide ZVS\nperformance for the power switch. The active clamp circuit\nnot only absorbs the leakage energy of the magnetic devices\nbut also passes the leakage current from the anti-parallel diode\n(body diode) of the main power switch before the gate sig-\nnal comes. However, due to the series connection of the CI\nand input DC source, high input current ripple is created in\nthese circuits, which is the main demerit of the converters.\nFurthermore, two new types of high-gain converter with ZVS\ncondition and low input current ripple are proposed in[22]\nand [23]. However, this converter cannot provide high voltage\ngain ratios.\nA new design of high voltage gain DC-DC converters has\nbeen proposed with high voltage gain in the form of trans-\ninverse characteristic versus turns ratio of the CI [24].I n\nthis topology, unlike other conventional CI-based converters,\nthe voltage gain is increased by reducing the magnetic turns\nratio, which leads to more efﬁciency improvement. Although\nthe converter draws a continuous current from the input DC\nsource, hard-switching performance and considerable reverse\nrecovery problems are the disadvantages of this circuit. In\n[25], [26], [27], some single-switch CI-based structures of\ntrans-inverse or partial trans-inverse of DC-DC converters\nwith low input current ripple and ZCS performance have\nbeen presented to provide high output voltage for RESs. In\nthese converters, a regenerative passive clamp circuit helps to\nrecycle the leakage inductor energy. In addition, the leakage\ninductor eliminates the diodes reverse recovery problem of the\nconverter diodes. A new modiﬁed Y-source step-up DC-DC\nconverter with ZVS characteristics is also proposed[28].I n\nthis topology, higher voltage gains are achieved by decreasing\nof turns ratios of the secondary and the tertiary sides of the CI.\nAnother effective way to improve the efﬁciency of the high-\nstep-up converters is utilizing a built-in transformer (BIT).\nDue to the zero average value of the currents passed through\nwindings of the BIT, the magnetic ﬂux is balanced which\nincreases the core saturation capability. Consequently, com-\nparing the CI-based topology, it is feasible to build the BIT\nwith a lower volume core. Also, the RMS values of the cur-\nrents that pass through the winding of a built-in transformer\nare reduced than the CI, which alleviates its conduction losses\n[11].I n [29] and [30], two new step-up DC-DC converters\nusing BIT and low input current ripple are introduced. These\ntopologies operate under ZVS conditions with LRR. More-\nover, in [31] and [32] two new type of BIT-based DC-DC\nconverter are presented. However, these converters suffer from\nlow voltage gain ratio and complex design procedure.\nBased on the above discussions, a new high step-up DC/DC\nconverter using a Three-Winding built-in transformer with\ncontinuous input current is presented. The main beneﬁts of\nthis proposed structure are categorized as follows:\n1) The capability to provide an ultra-High voltage gain\nunder a lower turns ratio (Trans–Inverse property);\n2) Utilizing a TWBT with zero average current value;\n3) Low component count (10 components);\n382 VOLUME 4, 2023\nFIGURE 1. Equivalent circuit of the proposed converter.\n4) Turn-ON ZVS performance for both switches;\n5) Low input current ripple;\n6) Low voltage stress of the switches;\n7) Very Low Reverse Recovery (LRR) problem;\nThis article is organized as follows. The topology descrip-\ntion and mathematical derivation of the suggested topology\nare provided and its soft-switching operation is analyzed in\nSections II and III. In Section IV, the main key indicators\nof the introduced converter are compared with some counter-\nparts. Converter design considerations are given in SectionV.\nThen, experimental results from a laboratory prototype are\nshown in SectionVI to verify the theoretical analysis. Finally,\na brief conclusion are provided in SectionVII.\nII. THE PROPOSED CONVERTER STRUCTURE AND\nPERIODIC STEADY-STATE OPERATION\nSchematic diagram of the proposed converter along with cir-\ncuit variables is shown in Fig.1. This converter is based on\nSEPIC and composed of a TWBT, an input inductor (Lin),\ntwo active switches including the main power switch (Sa), and\nan auxiliary switch (Sb), two diodes (D1, and Do), and four\ncapacitors (C1,C 2,C 3, and Co). TWBT comprises an ideal\ntransformer with turns of the primary, secondary, and tertiary\nwindings N1,N 2, and N3, a magnetizing inductance Lm and\na leakage inductance Lk, which is merged to the primary side\nof the built-in transformer. Combining the tertiary side of the\nbuilt-in transformer along with C3 and D1 in the form of a\nVM increases the voltage gain ratio of the converter by setting\nthe turns ratio. According to Fig.1, the voltage stress across\nthe power switch Sa is limited by a regenerative active clamp\ncircuit, consisting of C2 and Sb. In this state, the recovered\nenergy of the leakage inductance Lk, which is stored in C2,\nis transferred to the output with the help of a VM circuit.\nIn this circuit, the leakage inductances of the TWBI help to\neliminate the reverse recovery issue for the diodes D1 and\nDo. To simplify the circuit steady-state analysis, the following\nassumptions are considered during one switching period.\n1) All switching components are regarded as ideal.\n2) All capacitors are large enough. Thus, their voltage is\nconstant without any ripple.\n3) The TWBT is modeled as an ideal transformer with a\nmagnetizing inductor (LM) and a merged leakage induc-\ntor (Lk) referred to the primary side.\nFIGURE 2. Typical key waveforms of the proposed converter under CCM\noperation.\nFig. 2 shows the theoretical key waveforms of the presented\nconverter under CCM for one switching cycle, which are di-\nvided into six intervals. The equivalent circuits corresponding\nto each mode are depicted in Fig.3. The detailed operation\nprinciple is presented as follows.\nMode 1 [t0 –t 1]: From Fig. 2(a), before t = t0, the current\nof the leakage inductance of the TWBT (iLk) is negative.\nAt t = t0, the switch Sb turns off; while Sa has not yet\nreceived the power-on command. In this state, the leak-\nage inductance of the TWBT begins to resonate with the\nswitch output capacitances CrSa and CrSb. Therefore, CrSb is\ncharged while CrSa is discharged by the difference between\niLin and iN2.\nMode 2 [t1 –t 2]: The difference current between the input\ninductor and the secondary side of the TWBT (iLin and\niN2) ﬂows through the antiparallel diode (body diode) of\nswitch Sa (Fig. 3(b)). To achieve the soft-switching ZVS,\nthe power switch Sa should be turned on while its antipar-\nallel diode conducts. In this condition, the turn-on loss of\nSa is greatly reduced. In this mode, the input DC voltage is\napplied to the input inductorLin and TWBT, thus iLin and\niLk start to increase linearly.\nMode 3 [t2 –t 3]: At the beginning of the third time interval,\nthe power switch Sa starts to conduct under turn-ON ZVS\ncondition. As it is shown in Fig.3(c), the output diodeDo is\nconducting, while D1 is reverse-biased in this time duration.\nVOLUME 4, 2023 383\nHASANPOUR ET AL.: NEW SOFT-SWITCHED HIGH STEP-UP TRANS-INVERSE DC/DC CONVERTER BASED ON BUILT-IN TRANSFORMER\nFIGURE 3. Operation modes of the proposed converter. (a) Mode-1(t0-t1), (b) mode-2 (t1-t2), (c) mode-3 (t2-t3), (d) mode-4 (t3-t4), (e) mode-5 (t4-t5),\n(f) mode-6 (t5-t6), (g) mode-7 (t6-t7), and (h) mode-8 (t7-t8).\nThe leakage inductance of the TWBT decreases thedi/dt in\nthe main switch Sa during this state. In this mode, the input\ninductor (Lin) receives energy from the input DC voltage.\nThus, its current starts to increase at a positive slope. The\nseries connection between the leakage inductance of the\ntertiary side of the TWBT and the output diode leads to\niDo reaches to zero with a gentle slope without a reverse\nrecovery problem at the end of this transient mode (t = t3).\nMode 4 [t3 –t 4]: In the state, the power switchSa is still on,\nand the diode D1 starts to turn on at ZCS condition. As\ns h o w ni nF i g .3(d), the input inductor Lin is magnetized\nby the input power supply Vin; therefore its current (iLin)\nincreases linearly. Moreover, due to the positive voltage\napplied across the magnetizing inductor (L M) from the\ncapacitor C1, its current (iLM) starts to increase under a\npositive slope. Moreover, the capacitor C3 is charged by\nthe tertiary side of the TWBI and the capacitor C2.I nt h i s\nmode, the following equations can be given:\nvLin = Vin (1)\nvLM = K vC1\n1 − n21\n(2)\nvC3 = vC2 − vC1 + (1 + n31 )vLM (3)\nisa = iin + iN2 (4)\niD1 = iLk (1 − n21 )\nn21 + n21\n(5)\n384 VOLUME 4, 2023\nTABLE 1. Summary of Soft-Switching Performance of Switching Elements of the Proposed Converter\nHere, K denotes the coupling coefﬁcient of the TWBT,\nwhich is deﬁned as:\nK = LM\nLM + LK\n(6)\nMode 5 [t4 –t 5]: Sa is turned off att = t4; while Sb has not\nyet received the power-on command. In this time interval,\nDiode D1 is still on (Fig.3(e)). The leakage inductance of\nthe built-in transformer begins to resonate with the switch\noutput capacitances CrSa and CrSb. Therefore, CrSb is dis-\ncharged by ILin as well as iN2 while CrSa is charged. At the\nend of this interval, output capacitance CrSa is charged to\nVC2.\nMode 6 [t5 –t 6]: At t5, the antiparallel diode of the auxiliary\nswitch Sb is forced to conduct with the difference current\nbetween iLin and iN2 (Fig. 3(f)). In this mode, the energy\nstored in the leakage inductance of the TWBT is absorbed\nby the clamp capacitorC2. To achieve ZVS, the auxiliary\nswitch Sb should be turned on when its antiparallel diode\nconducts. In this interval, the negative voltage is placed\nacross Lm, thus its current start to reduce. In this state, the\nvoltage stress across the main switch Sa is clamped.\nMode 7 [t6 –t 7]: At t6, the turn-on signal of the clamp switch\nSb comes, and this switch begins to conduct under ZVS\nconditions. In this transition interval, the diode D1 is also\nconducting. In this mode, the capacitor C1 is charged by\nthe leakage inductance current of the built-in transformer.\nBecause of the series connection between the tertiary side\nof the TWBT and D1, the current of this diode (iD1) reaches\nzero with a low slope under the LRR conditions at the end\nof this mode.\nMode 8 [t7 –t 8]: In the mode, the auxiliary switchSb is still\non, and the diodeDo starts to turn on at ZVS condition,\nas it is shown in Fig.3(h). During this interval, the output\ncapacitor Co receives energy from the capacitor C3 and the\nmagnetizing inductor of the TWBT. Also, the capacitor C1\nreceives energy from the primary side of the TWBT. Due to\nthe negative voltage applied to the magnetizing inductor, its\ncurrent starts to decrease at a negative slope. In this mode,\nthe following equations can be given:\nvLin = Vin − vC2 (7)\nvLM = K vC1 − vC2\n1 − n21\n(8)\nvo = vC2 + vC3 − (n21 + n31 )vLM (9)\nisb = iin + iN2 (10)\nA summary of soft-switching performance of the switching\nelements of the proposed topology is illustrated in Table1.\nFIGURE 4. Voltage gain versus duty-ratio andK (n21 = 0.7 and n31 = 1.4).\nIII. STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED\nTOPOLOGY\nFor the sake of simple analysis, only operations Modes 4 and\n8 are considered, since the time duration of these modes is\nlarger than other intervals signiﬁcantly.\nA. VOLTAGE GAIN\nThe average value of the voltage of the capacitorsC1 and C2\ncan be calculated by employing the voltage-second balance\nprinciple for the input and magnetizing inductors over one\nswitching period as follows:\nVC1 = Vin (11)\nVC2 = Vin\n1 − D (12)\nHere, D is the duty cycle of the switchSa.U s i n g(2), (11),\nand (12), the voltage of the capacitorC3 is obtained as:\nVC3 = K(n31 + n21 ) (1 − D) + 1 − n21\n(1 − n21 )( 1 − D) .Vin (13)\nFinally, by using the relations(7)–(9), and (11)–(13),t h e\noverall voltage gain of the suggested converter is calculated\nas:\nM = Vo\nVin\n= K(n31 + n21 ) + 2 − 2n21\n(1 − n21 )( 1 − D) (14)\nFig. 4 shows the voltage gain of the suggested converter\nunder various duty cycle and some coupling coefﬁcient (n21 =\n0.7 andn31 = 1.4). It is clear that the existence of the leakage\ninductance has no signiﬁcant effect on the conversion ratio, so\nit can be neglected. Consequently, the ideal voltage gain of the\nproposed converter withK = 1 is obtained as:\nM = Vo\nVin\n= 2 + n31 − n21\n(1 − n21 )( 1 − D) (15)\nVOLUME 4, 2023 385\nHASANPOUR ET AL.: NEW SOFT-SWITCHED HIGH STEP-UP TRANS-INVERSE DC/DC CONVERTER BASED ON BUILT-IN TRANSFORMER\nFIGURE 5. Relationship between the voltage gain and duty cycle of the\nproposed converter for different values ofn21 and n31.\nFIGURE 6. Voltage gain of the converter versusn21 for some values ofn31\n(D = 0.55).\nFig. 5 illustrates the voltage gain of the proposed converter\nversus the duty cycle for some given turn ratios of the TWBT\n(n21 and n31). It reveals that high voltage gains can be obtained\nby increasing parametersD, n21, and n31. Regarding this ﬁg-\nure, it is clear that increasingn21 towards unity (n21→1) leads\nto a considerable increase in the voltage gain of the proposed\nconverter. In other words, the output voltage of the converter is\nmore sensitive ton21 than n31. Thus, in this converter, higher\nvoltage gain can be achieved under fewer turns ratios of the\nTWBT, which helps to reduce the conduction power losses.\nMoreover, Fig. 6 shows the voltage gain of the proposed\ntopology as a function of the turns ration21 for some values\nof n31 at a constant duty cycleD = 0.55. From this ﬁgure,\nby increasing the turns ration21 toward unity (n21 →1) an\nultra-high voltage gain can be achieved. In other words, un-\nlike the most coupled-inductor-based DC-DC converters, the\nvoltage gains of the proposed converter are increased under\nsmall turns ratios which can be considered as a unique merit\nof this topology.\nB. VOLTAGE AND CURRENT STRESS ACROSS THE POWER\nDEVICES\nAccording to Fig.3 and using(15), the magnitudes of drain-\nsource voltage stress (Vds) on the switches Sa and Sb can be\nobtained as follows:\nVds (Sa) = Vds (Sb) = Vin\n1 − D = (1 − n21 )\n2 + n31 − n21\nVo (16)\nAlso, the maximum repetitive peak reverse voltage on the\nconverter diodesD1 and Do can be deduced as:\nVD1 = VDo = 1 + n31\n2 + n31 − n21\nVo (17)\nConsidering (15), the input average current of the presented\nconverter is given as:\n< iin >= MIo (18)\nHere Io denotes the output load current. In this circuit, with\nthe help of the current average law for the converter capaci-\ntors, the average current values of the magnetic and leakage\ninductors of the TWBT are obtained as:\n< iLM >=< iLK 1 >= 0 (19)\nSince the average current value of the magnetic inductor of\nthe built-in transformer in the proposed converter is zero, the\nac ﬂux is balanced in the core which increases the saturation\nmargin. The peak current of the diodesD1 and Do can be\nestimated as follows:\niD1peak = 2Io\nD (20)\niDo_peak ≈ 2Io\n1 − D (21)\nBesides, the peak value of the currents passing through the\nswitches Sa and Sb can be given using(20) and (21) as:\niSa(Of f ) ≈\n(\nM + 2(1 + n31)\n(1 − n21 ) D\n)\nIo (22)\nISa(RMS ) = Io\n(\nM + 2(1 + n31)\n(1 − n21 ) D\n) √\nD\n3 (23)\niSb(Of f ) ≈\n( 2(1 + n31)\n(1 − n21 )( 1 − D) − M\n)\nIo (24)\nISb(RMS ) = Io\n( 2(1 + n31)\n(1 − n21 )( 1 − D) − M\n) √\nD3\n3 (25)\niN1(RMS ) = 2Io\n(n21 + n31)\n(1 − n21 )\n√\n1\n3D (1 − D) (26)\niN2(RMS ) = 2Io\n(1 + n31)\n(1 − n21 )\n√\n1\n3D (1 − D) (27)\niN3(RMS ) = 2Io\n√\n1\n3D (1 − D) (28)\niC1(RMS ) = 2Io\n(n21 + n31)\n(1 − n21 )\n√\n1\n3D (1 − D) (29)\niC2(RMS ) = Io\n√\n4\n3D (1 − D) + i2\nSa(Of f )\nD2\n2 + i2\nSb(Of f )\nD3\n2\n(30)\n386 VOLUME 4, 2023\nFIGURE 7.

From this ﬁgure, The\nbest range to choose the duty cycle is in the middle range\n(0.35<D<0.7). Because in this range, high voltage gains are\nobtained under minimum current stress level.\nC. POWER LOSS ANALYSIS\nIn this part, an analysis of the theoretical power dissipa-\ntions for the components used in the suggested converter is\nprovided.\nSwitch Loss: Every switch presents switching losses at on\nand off states along with conduction loss during their on-state.\nAs the presented topology operates under ZVS performance\nfor both switches Sa and Sb, only switch off-transitions in-\nvolve losses.

As can be seen, increasing the turns ratios of\nthe TWBT leads to an increase in voltage gain and a decrease\nin the converter efﬁciency. However, the proposed converter\nwith a high voltage gain and soft-switching performance, is\nable to provide high power-handling capacities.\nD. SOFT-SWITCHING CONDITION\nThe efﬁciency of the suggested circuit is improved with ZVS\nperformance for main and auxiliary switches (Sa and Sb).\nDuring operating modes 1 and 2 of the proposed converter,\nthe ZVS turn-ON of Sa is achieved due to the fact that its anti-\nparallel diode is ON before the gate pulse comes. To satisfy\nthe ZVS turn-ON of Sa, the available inductive energy should\nbe high enough so that iin + iN2 will still remain negative after\nCra is fully discharged during the resonant time of the mode-1;\nthus:\n1\n2 n2\n21Lk I2\nN2 ≥ 1\n2CrV 2\nCra (43)\nBy placing the values of iN2 in mode 1, and the voltage of\nthe switches, the following equation is obtained.\nLk > (2 + n31 − n21 )2CrV 2\nin\n4n2\n21(1 + n31 )2(Iin )2(1 − D)2 (44)\nHere, Cr = Cra + Crb.

Nevertheless,\nlarge values of the leakage inductance decrease the voltage\ngain of the circuit. Moreover, the minimum value of the output\npower under different values of the input DC voltage source\nFIGURE 10.

It can be\nseen that among these converters, the presented converter\nhas a superior voltage gain ratio compared to other con-\nverters. It is worth mentioning that the converter in [24]\nis also able to provide high voltage gains at the range of\n0.43 < D < 0.5. Nevertheless, the steep slope of voltage\ngain changes in this topology leads to its more complicated\ncontrol.\nFIGURE 13. Comparison of normalized voltage stress across the power\nswitch of the converters given in Table2.\nFurther, the normalized voltage stresses across the main\npower switch of the converters in Table2 are drawn in Fig.13.\nAmong the converters, the proposed topology has less switch\nvoltage stress for all ranges of the duty cycle. Similarly,\nFig. 14 depicts the normalized voltage across the output diode\nof the converters. From this plot, the output diode voltage\nstress is lower than the output voltage. The other converters\nthat provide less voltage stress across the output diode, are\ninferior in their other features. The electrical characteristics\nof the converters are also presented in Table2.

From this table, it can be stated that\nthe proposed converter has a suitable and acceptable power\ndensity.\nAccording to the above discussions, the suggested con-\nverter with low components count and soft-switching per-\nformance meets good performance for the renewable energy\ncases applications.\nV. CONVERTER DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\nFrom Fig. 7, the best range to choose the duty cycle is in\nthe middle range (0.35<D<0.7). Because in this range, high\nvoltage gains can be obtained at the minimum current stress\nlevels across the main power switch Sa. After determining the\nappropriate range of the duty cycle, it is necessary to select the\nproper values of the turns ratios n21 and n31. As mentioned\nbefore, n21 has a more signiﬁcant effect on increasing the\nvoltage gain of the converter. However, according to Figs.5\nand 6, although the increase of n21 leads to an increase in the\nvoltage gain, it also leads to an exponential increase in the\ncurrent stress. Consequently, choosing values very close to the\nunit is not recommended. It seems that choosingn21 < 0.8 can\nbe reasonable.\nBy considering an acceptable current ripple, the minimum\nvalue of the input inductor can be derived as:\nLin = Vin.D\n/Delta1Iin.fs\n> RL.D\nδ%M2.fs\n(49)\nwhere /Delta1Iin represents the permitted input current ripple. The\nminimum value of magnetizing inductance (Lm) of the TWBT\nTABLE 4. Introduction of Symbols Ap\ncan be designed by:\nLM > VLm.D\n/Delta1ILM .fs\n= Vin.D\n/Delta1ILM .

Then, the number of turns for input and magnetizing\ninductor can be determined as:\nN =\n√\nL\nAL\n(52)\nWhere, AL is inductance per turn that can be ﬁnd in selected\nmagnetic core datasheet.\nAccording to the converter output power, capacitor voltage,\nthe maximum tolerant voltage ripple (/Delta1VCo), and converter\nswitching frequency fs, the minimum value of the output ca-\npacitor Co can be obtained as:\nCo > D.Io\n/Delta1Vco.fs\n(53)\nIn addition, the proper values of the capacitorsC1, C2, and\nC3 are calculated as follows:\nC1 = iN1D\n/Delta1Vc1.fs\n> (n21 + n31 ) .Vout\n/Delta1VC1.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe theoretical analysis of the presented topology has been\nvalidated with a 200 W, 25 V input, and 400 V output sam-\nple prototype in the laboratory. The main components of\nthe prototype are listed in Table 5. In this prototype, two\nphotocouplers TLP350 are used for driving the state of the\nMOSFETs. Because of the low voltage rate on the converter\nswitches Sa and Sb, two MOSFETs IPP076N15N5 with very\nlow RDS(on) are utilized. To decrease the conduction power\nloss in the circuit, MKT capacitors are used forC1-C3.T h e\nexperimental waveforms of the voltage and current of the\ncomponents were obtained using a high-frequency current\nprobe PA-667 and a differential voltage probe GDP-025. Cur-\nrent probe PA-667 has division coefﬁcients of 500 m and\n50 m and differential voltage probe GDP-025 has division\ncoefﬁcients of x20, x50 and x200.\nFig. 15(a) represents the gate signals of the MOSFETsSa\nand Sb. In Figs. 15(b) and 16, the experimental results of\nthe voltage and current of the converter switches at full load\nare provided. In these ﬁgures, the soft-switching performance\n(ZVS turn-on) of the MOSFETs Sa and Sb with zoomed\nZVS region are shown. With the help of an active clamp, the\nswitches’ voltage stress are limited to about 50 V under Vo\n= 400 V . This low voltage rate across the switches lets to\nuse of MOSFETs with lower Rds(ON). The LRR conditions at\nthe turn- off instant of the diodes D1 and Do of the converter\nare realized in Figs.17 and 18(a). Continuous input current\nwaveforms along with the leakage inductance current and the\noutput voltage of the proposed converter at full load condi-\ntion in steady-state, are given in Fig.18(b). Because of the\nsoft-switching performance and LRR conditions for all diodes\nof the converter, the output DC voltage is constant without\nvoltage spikes and noises at the switching instants, which\nis the other beneﬁts of the suggested topology. For different\noutput power levels, the efﬁciency of the proposed converter\nis measured and illustrated in Fig.19. Measured maximum\nFIGURE 15. Experimental results of the converter at full load.

CONCLUSION\nIn this article, a new ZVS high voltage gain DC-DC con-\nverter with a low number of components has been proposed\nfor renewable energy source applications. By implementing\na three-winding built-in transformer with a voltage multiplier\ncircuit, a ﬂexible voltage gain with trans-inverse property is\nachieved. In such a case, high voltage gain can be obtained\nunder a lower turns ratio of the transformer. The maximum\nvoltage stress on the power MOSFET is considerably re-\nstricted by utilizing an active clamp circuit, which is also\nguaranteed the soft-switching (ZVS tuns-on) performance for\nthe switches. High voltage gain, low components count, the\n392 VOLUME 4, 2023\nsoft-switching (ZVS) performance, continuous input current\nwith low ripple, enough high efﬁciency, low voltage stress,\nand low reverse recovery are the main advantages of the\nproposed converter. The feasibility of the proposed converter\ndesign has been proved through a 25 V–400 V and 200 W\nlaboratory prototype.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Forouzesh, Y . P. Siwakoti, S. A. Gorji, F.
