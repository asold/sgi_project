Although cellulose insulating paper has relative good properties, \ninsulating b reakdown is still the maj or factor that causes the electrical failures of oil -\nimmersed power transformers  (Oommen and Prevost  2006). With the development of \nultra-high voltage power transmission, especially the ± 1100 kV transmission system under \nconstruction in China, the reliability of oil -impregnated insulating paper has become a \nchallenge that requires better insulation and mechanical properties of insulating paper \n(Ziomek 2012). \nWith the development of nanotechnology, new approaches may be considered for \nthe modifications of insulating paper.  The properties of melamine grafted nano -SiO2 \nmodified insulating paper were studied, and the breakdown strength of the modified \n \nPEER-REVIEWED ARTICLE  bioresources.com \n \n \nChen et al. (2019). “CNC in transformer paper,” BioResources 14(3), 6837-6850.  6838  \ninsulating paper has been improved ( Tang et al . 2018). The electrical properties of \ninsulating paper modified by nano-hollow SiO2 were investigated, and the AC breakdown \nfield of the oil/nanomodified paper composite was increased from 26.4 kV to 30.5 kV (Liao \net al. 2012). The addition of nano-TiO2 (Liao et al. 2013) or nano-montmorillonite (Yuan \nand Liao 2014) could improve the AC breakdown strength of the paper. Howerver, \nmechanical properties, which play a crucial role in determining the lifetime of insulating \npaper, normally decreased (Zhang et al. 2015; Tang et al. 2016). In addition, preparation \nprocess for the aforementioned nanomodified paper was usually complex due to the \nincompatibility between inorganic nanoparticles and organic cellulose fibers (Huang et al. \n2017; Tang et al. 2017; Cao et al. 2019). Therefore, an organic nano -additive may be a \ngood substitute, especially when it originates from cellulose fiber. \nCellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are a polymer functional material and are extracted \nfrom fibers after a complete dissolution of the non-crystalline fraction (Habibi et al. 2010). \nThe CNCs made from different methods and different raw materials have different \nproperties. They have attracted much attention as reinforced nanofillers due to their good \nmechanical properties with high stiffness a nd elastic modulus  (Campano et al . 2017 ; \nHerrera et al . 2017 ; Ding et al . 2018 ; Sheng et al . 2018). Compared to the inorganic \nnanoparticles, CNCs prepared from natural cellulose fiber are more compatible with \ncellulose insulation, and they have potential a pplication in transformer insulating paper. \nHuang et al. (2017) explored different concentrations of nanofibrillated cellulose, cationic \nnanofibrillated cellulose, and anionic nanofibrillated cellulose as the potential nano -\nadditives on the mechanical and breakdown properties of insulating press paper. The results \nshowed that the addition of nano-cellulose of 10 wt% can improve the tensile strength and \ninsulation properties of insulating press paper.  \nIn this  study, Two types of CNC,  prepared by TEMPO -oxidized (T -CNC) and \nsulfuric acid hydrolysis (S-CNC) respectively, were used as nano-additive in the insulating \npaper. The functional groups and crystallinities of the insulating paper were characterized \nby Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning \nelectron microscopy (SEM). To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the effect of \nCNCs, the performance including tensile strength, breakdown behavior, and oil absorption \nrate of insulating paper were measured and analyzed. Also, the effect of pulp properties on \nthe properties of insulating paper containing CNC were investigated.  \n \n \nEXPERIMENTAL \n \nRaw Materials \nCNCs prepared by the TEMPO -oxidized (T-CNC) and by the sulfuric acid \nhydrolysis (S-CNC) were supplied by Tianjin University of Science and Technology \n(Tianjin, China). The carboxyl content of T -CNC was 0.8 mmol/g. The unbleached kraft \nsoftwood pulp for the manufacture of insulating paper was supplied by Guangxin Paper \nCo. Ltd. (Hunan, China). The #25 transformer oil was supplied by Kion Company (Hubei, \nChina). Deionized water was used in all experiments. \n \nPreparation of Insulating Paper \nPreparation of reference insulating paper sample \nThe dry unbleached kraft softwood pulp was soaked in deionized water for 12 h. \nThe soaked pulp was  refined by a PFI beater (KRK, Tokyo, Japan) to approximately 30 \n \nPEER-REVIEWED ARTICLE  bioresources.com \n \n \nChen et al.

The 0.5 wt% pulp suspension was transferred to a Rapid-\nKöthern sheet former  (Xi’an papermaking mach ine Co., Ltd,  Xi’an, China) to make a \nhandsheet with a basis weight of 80 g/m2 according to the ISO 5269-2 (2004). Finally, the \ninsulating paper were obtained after drying at 105 °C for 15 min. \n \nPreparation of insulating paper containing CNC \nThe refined kraft pulp was re-dispersed with a pulper at a concentration of 0.5 wt%. \nThe suitable amount of CNC (T -CNC, S-CNC) suspension at 2.0 wt% was added to the \npulp slurry. The suspension of fiber and CNC was then strongly stirred with a blender for \n45 s to obtain a homogeneous suspension. After that, the subsequent sheet-forming and \ndrying processes were the same as the preparation of the reference insulating paper sample.  \n \nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analysis \nThe morphology of T-CNC and S-CNC were examined by Zeiss  EM 109 TEM \n(Oberkochen, Germany). A drop of diluted CNCs aqueous suspension was deposited on a \nCu microgrid (200 mesh) and allowed to dry. The grid was negatively stained with a 3% \n(w/w) solution of uranyl acetate and dried at room temperature. The sample was observed \nat 80 kV. A hundred CNCs were randomly selected, and a minimum of 100 and 200 \nmeasurements were used to determine the average length and the diameter, respectively. \n \nFTIR Spectral Analysis \nFTIR spectra of the reference and the insulating paper containing different CNC  \nwere recorded by a Bruker Vertex  70v vacuum spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) in \nreflection mode. FTIR samples were prepared by mixing the paper samples power with \nspectroscopic grade KBr (2 mg paper power / 200 mg KBr) and compressed to the sheet.  \nEach spectrum was recorded over the spectral range from 4000 cm-1 to 400 cm -1 with a \nspectral resolution of 2 cm-1 by 64 scans at room temperature. For each spectrum, the FTIR \nspectra were adjusted by subtraction of the KBr spectra (background)  \n \nXRD Analysis \nThe XRD patterns investigations of insulating paper containing different CNC s \nwere measured on a D/MAX2200X X-ray diffractometer (Tokyo, Japan) with a Cu kα \nradiation source energized at 45 kV. Measurements were collected in the 2 θ range from \n10° to 50° at a rate of 1°/min. The measurement resolution was 0.02°. The peak height \nmethod was used to calculate the crystallinity index ( CI) ( Martins et al . 2011).

For each kind of \ninsulating paper, eight measurements were conducted. \n \nOil Absorption Rate \nThe oil absorption rate of insulating paper was measured according to IEC 60641-\n2 (2004), and the size of test sample was 100 mm × 100 mm. The sample was first vacuum \ndried at 105 °C  for 24 h to weigh the dry mass of the insulating paper ( M1), and then a \nvacuum soaking #25 transformer oil was carried out. After the vacuum removal, the sample \nwas further soaked in oil for 6 h. Finally, the excess transformer oil on the paper surface \nwas wiped off and the weight of the oil -paper sample ( M2) was weighed , and the oil \nabsorption rate (X) was calculated with the following equation, \n      \n%100\n1\n21\n M\nMMX                                       (1) \nFor each group of samples, three samples were measured , and the average value \nwas taken as the oil absorption rate. \n \nAC Breakdown Strength \nAC breakdown voltage of insulating paper was measured using an HT-5/20A \nbreakdown voltage tester produced by Guilin Electric Research Institute Co.  Ltd. (Guilin, \nChina) according to the IEC 60243-3 (2001). The electrode consists of two metal cylinders, \nwhere one edge is inverted into a circular arc with a radius of 3 mm ± 0.2 mm. One of the \nelectrodes had a diameter of 25 mm ± 1 mm and a height of 25 mm, and the other one was \n75 ± 1 mm in diameter and 15 mm in height. The AC breakdown voltage in air was \nmeasured at room temperature in the air, and the AC breakdown voltage in oil was \nmeasured using the insulating oil as the dielectric surrounding the equipment. The size of \nthe paper samples was 75 mm × 75 mm, which was large enough to prevent surface \nflashover. For each kind of insulation paper, eight measurements were taken. \n \nConductivity of Insulating Paper Extract \nThe insulating paper samples were cut 5 mm × 5 mm in size,  and extracted in a \nboiling d eionized water  bath for 60 min. T he conductivity of the extracted liquid was \nmeasured by a DDSJ-308A conductivity meter produced by Shanghai Electrical Science \nInstrument Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) according to GB/T 7977 (2007).  \n \nSEM Analysis \nThe surface morphology of insulating paper were analyzed using a Jeol scanning \nelectron microscope (JSM -6490LV, Kyoto, Japan).The images were obtained using an \naccelerating voltage of 20 kV. \n \nStatistical Analysis \nAll the experiments were carried out at least three times. Mean values and standard \ndeviations were analyzed and reported by using the Origin Program 8.0 (Origin Lab \nCompany, USA). Statistical analysis was performed using EXCELTM 2016 (Microsoft, \nUSA) and significant difference among the means was estimated at 95 % confidence level \n(P < 0.05). \n \n  \n \nPEER-REVIEWED ARTICLE  bioresources.com \n \n \nChen et al.

It can be observed that the \nT-CNC was thin and short. The length ( L) and diameter ( D) of T-CNC was 150±50 nm, \nand 30±10 nm, respectively , and the aspect ratio ( L/D) was 5 to 10. The S-CNC had the \ncharacteristics of coarse and long, with an L value of 250±50 nm, a D value of 50±20 \nnm, and an L/D ratio of 4 to 10. Both kinds of CNC had a certain agglo meration, which \nwas caused by poor stability of CNC suspension in solution. \n \n \n \nFig. 1.

The bands at  3430 cm-1 and \n1380 cm-1 were attributed to the O-H stretching vibration and a C-H bending vibration of \nthe intermolecular hydrogen bond , respectively. It can be seen that  the intensity of the \nabsorption peak at 3430 cm-1 of the insulating paper containing T-CNC and S-CNC was \nmuch higher than that of the reference insulating paper, which indicated the presence of \nCNC in the modified insulating paper. The band at 292 0 cm-1 was due to the asymmetric \nstretching of -CH2, and its density was relatively higher for the insulating paper containing \nT-CNC and S-CNC. The band at 1060 cm-1 was due to the stretching of C-O, and the bands \nat 1630 cm-1 could be owing to the stretching of conjugate C = O. For the insulating paper \ncontaining T-CNC, the intensity of absorption peak at 1630 cm -1 was higher, because the \ncarbonyls of T-CNC were more than that of S-CNC. \n \nXRD Analysis \nThe XRD patterns of reference insulating paper such as insulating paper containing \nT-CNC and S -CNC are presented in Fig.  3. Three kinds of insulating paper had four \ndiffraction peaks at 2θ = 15.2°, 16.3°, 22.6°, and 34.5°, and the positions of the peaks were \nbasically the sam e, which belong to the crystal plane (110), (110), (002) , and (040), \nrespectively. The results showed that the crystal types of cellulose of insulating paper were \nall cellulose I. The crystallinity index (CI) was calculated by the peak height method and \nthe crystallinity index of the insulating paper containing T-CNC (CI 84.01%) was higher \nthan that of the reference insulating paper (CI 82.11%), which can be attributed to the high \ncrystallinity of T-CNC. However, the crystallinity index of the insulating paper containing \nS-CNC (CI 80.31%) was lower than that of the reference insulating paper (CI 82.11%), \nwhich may be caused by partial degradation of the crystallization area by acid hydrolysis \n(Bondeson et al. 2006; Pan et al. 2013).  \n \n10 20 30 40 50\nI002IAM\nIntensity/a.u.\n2θ/°\n 1.Reference Cl=82.11%\n 2.T-CNC      Cl=84.01%\n 3.S-CNC      Cl=80.31%\n1\n2\n3\n \n \nFig. 3.

Figure \n4 shows that the tensile index of insulating paper first increased and then decreased with \nthe increase of CNC content. The tensile index reached the maximum value when the CNC \ndosage was 0.9%, which is 70.22 N • m/g  for T-CNC, 21.7 0% higher than that of the \nreference insulating paper; 66.12  N • m/g  for S -CNC, 14.57% higher than that of the \nreference insulating paper. The H -bonding (from electrostatic and charge transfer) and  \nsuperposition interactions (from van der Waals interactions  and hydrophobic ity) \ndetermined the biomolecular structure of the cellulose layer (Müller-Dethlefs and Hobza \n2000). The improvement of the tensile index of insulating paper containing CNC can be \nattributed to the rich free hydroxyl group s on the surface of  CNC. When the CNC was \nretained on the insulating paper, CNC would fill in the gaps within the paper to improve \nthe paper strength . T he network structure formed between the fibers  and enhanced the \nadhesion between the fibers, which improved the tensile strength of paper. When the CNC \ndosage was higher than 0.9%, the fiber s began to aggregate, which reduced the tensile \nstrength of the paper. Figure 3 also shows that T-CNC was noticeable better than S -CNC \nin enhancing the tensile strength of insulating paper. \n \n0.0 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75Tensile index (N▪m/g)\nCNC (wt.%)\n T-CNC\n S-CNC\n \n \nFig. 4. Effect of CNC on the tensile strength of insulating paper  \n \nEffect of CNC on the AC Breakdown Strength of Insulating Paper  \nThe AC breakdown strength is an important insulating characteristic of insulating \npaper. Figures 5 and 6 showed the effects of CNC on the AC breakdown strength of \ninsulating paper in air and in oil. The AC breakdown strength of insulating paper in air \nincreased gradually with the increase of the CNC dosage. When the CNC dosage was 0.9%, \nthe AC breakdown strength in air reached the maximum value, which was 7.38 kV/mm for \nT-CNC, 7.89% higher than that of the reference paper; and 7.31 kV/mm for S-CNC, which \nwas 6.87% higher than that of the reference paper. The CNC was nano -particle sized and \nhad many hydroxyl groups on its surface, which can be filled into the inner gaps of the \ninsulating paper and form hydrogen bonds to adsorb tightly on the surface of the fi ber. It \ncan reduce the space charge accumulation and increase the density of the deep level trap in \ninsulating paper, which results in an improve ment in the insulating property of the \nCNC (wt%) \nTensile index (N·m/g) \n \nPEER-REVIEWED ARTICLE  bioresources.com \n \n \nChen et al.

Effect of CNC on the AC breakdown strength of insulating paper in oil \n \nOil-paper insulation is the main insulation method of transformer and the insulating \nstrength of oil-paper is very important. Figure 6 shows that the AC breakdown strength of \ninsulating paper in oil noticeably improved with the increase of the CNC dosage. When \nthe CNC dosage was 0.9%, the AC breakdown  strength of T-CNC and S-CNC insulating \npaper in oil were 59.78 kV/mm and 56.53 kV/mm,  which were 24.6% and 17.8% higher \nthan that of the reference insulating paper, respectively. This was because the addition of \nCNC has improved the oil absorption rate of insulating paper, which would be confirmed \nin the following discussion, thus improving the insulation strength of the oil-paper system. \nHowever, when the CNC dosage was more than 0.9%, the AC breakdown  strength of \ninsulating paper in oil decreased rapidly.

The results also showed \nthat the effect of T-CNC on the AC breakdown strength in oil was slightly better than that \nof S-CNC. It was related to the source of T-CNC and S-CNC. Figures 4 and 5 also showed \nthat the AC breakdown strength of insulating paper in oil was much higher than that in air, \nwhich also proved that oil-paper insulation in transformer was a good way of insulation. \n \nEffect of CNC on the Oil Absorption Rate of Insulating Paper \nOil absorption rate is an important parameter of insulating paper  that affects the \nstability of the oil -paper insulation system . In general, the dielectric coefficient of \ninsulating paper is 4 to 5, while that of insulating oil is about 2.2. Under the action of the \nelectric field, the field intensity shared in composite insulation is inversely proportional to \nthe dielectric coefficient of the material (Wu et al. 2012). Improving the oil absorption rate \nof insulating paper is beneficial to the distribution of electric field intensity. Figure 7 shows \nthe effect of CNC on the oil absorption rate of insulating paper. It can be seen that the oil \nabsorption rate of insulating paper increase d significantly with the increase of the CNC \ndosage. The oil absorption rate was the highest  when the CNC dosage was  0.9%, which \nwas 53.08% for T -CNC (39.40% higher than that of the reference insulating paper), and \n46.27% for S -CNC (21.54% higher than that of the reference insulating paper). This \nindicated that the addition of CNC had a positive impact on the performance of insulating \npaper. The CNC has similar properties with cellulose and more adsorption point s. It can \nimprove the oil absorption rate of insulating paper, thus improving the insulation properties \nof oiled paper. The results also showed that the improvement of  the oil absorption rate of \ninsulating paper by T-CNC was more obvious than that by S-CNC. It may be that T-CNC \nhad more carboxyl groups, which promoted the absorption of oil. \n \n0.0 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60Oil absorption rate (%)\nCNC (wt.%)\n T-CNC\n S-CNC\n \n \nFig. 7.

Effect of CNC on the conductivity of insulating paper \n \nEffects of the Beating Degree on the Properties of Insulating Paper \nBeating degree is one of the important parameters of softwood pulp, which affects \nthe length of fibers and the binding force between fibers, thus affecting the physical and \nelectrical properties of insulating paper . Table 1 show s the effects of  the different pulp \nbeating degree on the properties of insulating paper c ontaining T-CNC. With the increase \nof the beating degree, the tensile strength  and the AC breakdown voltage in oil and air of \nthe insulating paper all increased, but the oil absorption rate decreased gradually. When the \nbeating degree of pulp was 37 °SR,  the tensile strength of insulating paper  increased by \n2.46%, the AC breakdown strength of insulating paper in oil and in air increased by 3.4% \nand 12.8%, but the oil absorption rate decreased by 1 4.9%, compared with the insulating \npaper of the beating degree 31 °SR. However, when the pulp beating degree increased from \n37 °SR to 45 °SR, the variation range of the performance of insulating paper was very \nsmall. \n \nTable 1.

With a \ncloser fiber bonding, there is less  space between the fibers.  Considering the performance \nand energy consumption of insulating paper, when the  T-CNC dosage  was 0.9%, the \noptimum beating degree of the softwood pulp was about 37 oSR. \n \nSEM Analysis \nFigure 9 shows the SEM of  reference insulating paper and insulating paper \ncontaining T-CNC. It can be seen that the surface of insulating paper containing T -CNC \nwas smoother than that of the reference insulating paper. The introduced T -CNC can be \nadsorbed to fiber surfaces and act ed as a nanofiller,  which reduced the amount of space \nbetween the fibers and improve the smoothness of fiber surface. Thus it improved the \nproperties of insulating paper. \n \n   \n \nFig. 9. SEM image of reference insulating paper (a) and Insulating Paper Containing T-CNC \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n1. The transformer insulating paper containing TEMPO -oxidized cellulose nanocrystals \n(T-CNC) and sulfuric acid hydrolyzed cellulose nanocrystals (S -CNC) were prepared \nand characterized. The intensity of the absorption peak at 3 430 cm-1 of the insulating \npaper containing T -CNC and S -CNC was much higher than that of the reference \ninsulating paper. The crystallinity index of the insulating paper containing T-CNC was \nhigher than that of the reference insulating paper, but the crysta llinity index of the \ninsulating paper containing S -CNC was lower than that of the reference insulating \npaper, due to the different preparation methods of CNC.   \n2. The T-CNC and S -CNC both can effectively improve the mechanical and electrical \nperformances of insulating paper, and the effects of T-CNC were a little better than that \nof S-CNC. When the T-CNC dosage was 0.9%, the tensile strength was 70.22 N • m/g, \nwhich was 21.7% higher than the reference paper. Its AC breakdown strength in air, in \noil and oil ab sorption rates of the insulating paper were 7.38 kV/mm, 59.78kV/mm, \nand 53.08% respectively, which was improved by 7.9%, 24.6%, and 39.4%, respective \nto that of the reference insulating paper. The T-CNC and S-CNC had little influence on \nthe conductivity of insulating paper. The beating degree of pulp affect the mechanical \nand electrical properties of insulating paper containing CNC. When the T-CNC dosage \nwas 0.9%, the optimum beating degree of softwood pulp was about 37 oSR. SEM \nmicrographs showed that the introduced T-CNC can act as a nanofiller, improving the \nstructure of insulating paper.  \n \na b \n \nPEER-REVIEWED ARTICLE  bioresources.com \n \n \nChen et al.
