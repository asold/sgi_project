    "abstract": "Patients, relatives, doctors, and healthcare providers anticipate the evidence-based length of stay (LOS) prediction in neurosurgery. This study aimed to assess the quality of LOS prediction with the GPT3 language model upon the narrative medical records in neurosurgery comparing to doctors’ and patients’ expectations. We found no significant difference (p = 0.109) between doctors’, patients’, and model’s predictions with neurosurgeons tending to be more accurate in prognosis. The modern neural network language models demonstrate feasibility in LOS prediction.",
