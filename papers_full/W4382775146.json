    "abstract": "The surge in cybercrime has emerged as a pressing concern in contemporary society due to its far-reaching financial, social, and psychological repercussions on individuals. Beyond inflicting monetary losses, cyber-attacks exert adverse effects on the social fabric and psychological well-being of the affected individuals. In order to mitigate the deleterious consequences of cyber threats, adoption of an intelligent agent-based solution to enhance the speed and comprehensiveness of cyber intelligence is advocated. In this paper, a novel cyber intelligence solution is proposed, employing four semantic agents that interact autonomously to acquire crucial cyber intelligence pertaining to any given country. The solution leverages a combination of techniques, including a convolutional neural network (CNN), sentiment analysis, exponential smoothing, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), Porter stemming, and others, to analyse data from both social media and web sources. The proposed method underwent evaluation from 13 October 2022 to 6 April 2023, utilizing a dataset comprising 37,386 tweets generated by 30,706 users across 54 languages. To address non-English content, a total of 8199 HTTP requests were made to facilitate translation. Additionally, the system processed 238,220 cyber threat data from the web. Within a remarkably brief duration of 6 s, the system autonomously generated a comprehensive cyber intelligence report encompassing 7 critical dimensions of cyber intelligence for countries such as Russia, Ukraine, China, Iran, India, and Australia.",
