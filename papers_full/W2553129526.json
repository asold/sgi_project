However, evidence such as South African Early Stone Age modified \nbones, European Lower Palaeolithic flaked bone tools, along with Middle and Late Pleistocene bone \nretouchers, led to a re-evaluation of the conception of Homo sapiens as the exclusive manufacturer of \nspecialised bone tools. The evidence presented herein include use wear and bone residues identified \non two flint scrapers as well as a sawing mark on a fallow deer tibia, not associated with butchering \nactivities. Dated to more than 300 kya, the evidence here presented is among the earliest related to \ntool-assisted bone working intended for non-dietary purposes, and contributes to the debate over \nthe recognition of bone working as a much older behaviour than previously thought. The results of \nthis study come from the application of a combined methodological approach, comprising use wear \nanalysis, residue analysis, and taphonomy. This approach allowed for the retrieval of both direct and \nindirect evidence of tool-assisted bone working, at the Lower Palaeolithic site of Qesem Cave (Israel).\nHomo sapiens’ supposedly exclusive manufacture of specialised tools made from modified animal bones, along \nwith other aspects such as art and specialised hunting weapons, has led to the definition of a clear behavioural and \ncognitive boundary between H. sapiens and the other species of the genus Homo\n1.\nHowever, numerous evidence, coming from South Africa and Europe, suggests that the exploitation of mod-\nified animal bones should be viewed as an expression of a much older behaviour. Some of the oldest evidence \nrelating to the use of modified animal bones comes from several Early Stone Age South African contexts\n2–6. \nAnimal bones were used by early hominids for termite foraging at the sites of Swartkrans and Sterkfontein, dated \nbetween 1.8 and 1 mya\n2,3. Analysis of the bone tools found at the site of Drimolen3,4, dated between 2 and 1.5 mya, \nprovided similar results. As in the cases of Sterkfontein and Swartkrans, the use wear identified on the tips of the \ntools suggests their use for digging soil, most likely to be associated with termite foraging. Evidence of intentional \nbone modification has been recorded at Swartkrans where the tips of several horn cores bear traces of intentional \nshaping through grinding activities\n5. Furthermore, at Broken Hill (Kabwe) in Zambia, several bone tools were \ndiscovered which bear evidence of shaping by cutting with stone tools and subsequent polishing; these tools are \nattributed to the early Middle Stone Age\n6.\nOther examples of tools made from modified animal bones include flaked bone tools, such as bifaces made \nfrom flaked elephant bones that have been found in several Acheulean contexts, bone flakes and bone retouchers, \nunearthed in numerous Middle and Late Pleistocene sites\n7–15. Further evidence of specialised bone tool produc-\ntion comes from the Middle Palaeolithic sites of Pech de l’ Azé I and Abri Peyrony in France. In these sites, animal \nribs were shaped by Neanderthals to create bone smoothers (lissoirs ), which were used specifically to process \nhide\n16.\n1Department of Archaeology, Tel-Aviv University, Institute of Archaeology, POB 39040, 69978, Tel Aviv, Israel. \n2Scientific Methodologies Applied to Cultural Heritage (SMATCH), ISMN-CNR c\\o Dept. of Chemistry, “Sapienza” \nUniversità di Roma, Rome, Italy. 3Centro Nacional de Investigacìon sobre la Evolucìon Humana (CENIEH), Paseo \nSierra de Atapuerca 3, 09002, Burgos, Spain. 4Àrea de Prehistòria, Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV), Avinguda de \nCatalunya, 35, 43002, Tarragona, Spain. 5IPHES; Institut Català de Paleoecologia Humana i Evoluciò Social, Campus \nSescelades URV (Edifici W3), 43007, Tarragona, Spain. 6McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University \nof Cambridge, United Kingdom. 7Department of Classics, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.

This evidence originates from ongoing excavations at the \nMiddle Pleistocene site of Qesem Cave in Israel and has not yet been observed in any other context as old as this. \nOur evidence includes two flint tools, which bear use wear associated with bone working and preserved bone \nresidues on their edges, and a broken fallow deer tibia exhibiting a non-dietary sawing mark. The evidence pre-\nsented here is at least 300 kya old—possibly closer to 400 kya17,18—and is potentially some of the earliest evidence \nof deliberate stone tool-assisted bone working associated with non-dietary purposes.\nResults\nThe Middle Pleistocene site of Qesem Cave in Israel is dated between 420 and 200 kya and is culturally associated \nwith the late Lower Palaeolithic Acheulo-Y abrudian Cultural Complex (AYCC). Ongoing research at the cave \nprovides a wealth of well-preserved evidence for innovative behaviours throughout the sequence, including stone \ntools technology and use 19–21, subsistence economy 22,23, and site organisation 24,25, possibly practised by a new \nhominin lineage26.\nUse Wear Analysis\nOngoing functional analysis, performed by means of use wear and residue analyses (for details, see SI 1 and 2), \non Quina and demi-Quina scrapers unearthed at the site, provided strong evidence of bone processing on at least \none Quina scraper (QC-D/7b-1085-1090) and one demi-Quina scraper (QC-E/8b-950-955). Here we present the \nobservations and analysis of these two flint implements.\nQC-D/7b-1085-1090 (Fig. 1a) is a flint Quina scraper with an abrupt, straight edge exhibiting a scale-stepped \ninvasive retouch. The damage observed on the tool’s edge consists of close regular step scars located both on the \nventral and dorsal edge surfaces associated with an overall high degree of edge rounding (Fig. 1d). Smooth flat \npolish, exhibiting an oblique unidirectional orientation, is present on the tool’s edge, and on both the ventral and \ndorsal surfaces (Fig. 1b).\nQC-E/8b-950-955 (Fig. 2a) is a demi-Quina flint scraper with a thin, straight edge exhibiting a scale-stepped \nretouch. The damage affecting the tool’s edge consists of step scars located both on the ventral and dorsal edge \nsurfaces, along with an overall high degree of edge rounding. Several snapped edge areas are present as well. \nThe micro wear identified consists of a smooth flat polish located on both the tool’s ventral and dorsal surfaces \n(Fig. 2b). The edge damage and micro wear observed on the working edges of both tools are clearly related to bone \nworking performed with a longitudinal motion.\nFigure 1. (a) Specimen QC-D7b-1085-1090 from Qesem Cave, the yellow square indicates the Micro-FTIR \nsampling point; (b) smooth flat polish, associated to bone working, developed over both the ventral and dorsal \nsurface of the tool; (c) Micro-FTIR spectra of the tool; (d) edge damage located over the dorsal surface the tool \nassociable to hard material processing.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScientific  REPORTS  | 6:37686 | DOI: 10.1038/srep37686\nResidue Analysis\nUsing Micro Fourier Transform Infra-Red (Micro-FTIR) spectroscopy we were able to identify preserved bone \nresidue on the working edges of both tools (for details, see Supplementary Information). Hydroxyapatite, rep -\nresenting the mineral component of bone, was found on the dorsal surface of the edges of QC-D/7b-1085-1095 \n(Fig. 1c) and QC-E/8b-950-955 (Fig. 2c).\nIn both cases the Micro-FTIR spectrum of the edge’s dorsal surface shows a shoulder on the low frequency side \nof the Si-O stretching mode (~913 cm−1); this suggests the presence of bone micro residues, as it is attributable \nto the PO3=  stretching mode of calcium phosphate (apatite), which constitutes the bone’s mineral component.\nResidues morphologically comparable to bone tissues have also been identified, via microscope, on the edge \nand on the surfaces of QC-E/8b-950-955.\nThese residues are represented by: (a) whitish elongated fibres trapped in an old fracture along the edge of the \ntool (Fig. 3a); (b) numerous whitish opaque patches with a corrugated and sometimes cracked appearance, filling \nthe micro-depressions which characterise both the surfaces and the edge of the tool (Fig. 3b); and (c) white glob-\nular concretions of glossy appearance, packed into micro-fractures along the edge of the tool alone. All residues \nare birefringent when polarised light is used. Furthermore, it was possible to distinguish and characterise collagen \nfibres and bone mineral particles within the residues, using an SEM equipped with an EDS probe (Figs 2d and 3c).\nAdditional bone processing-related use wear and preserved bone residues have been identified on small \nsharp flint items produced via a form of recycling 19,21,27 , recovered from Qesem Cave following similar ana -\nlytical procedures (for details, see Supplementary Information, in particular Supplementary Figure S3 and \nSupplementary Table S3).\nTaphonomic Analysis\nIn addition to the lithic evidence, we present a bone specimen that reinforces our hypothesis of bone working \nactivity, performed using specific stone tools. The bone specimen from square F/9c-735–740 cm below datum is a \ndistal tibia shaft fragment from a fallow deer. While this bone comes from a higher elevation within the sequence \nthan the two artefacts discussed above, it is still relevant as it was associated with the same (AYCC) cultural con-\ntext and with the same techno-typological flint assemblage as the previously described flint tools. The broken \ntibia is most probably part of a fallow deer limb that was brought to the cave, processed for food, discarded, and \nlater modified with a flint tool. It shows a set of concentrated and overlapping short and deep incisions on the \nbone surface, best described as a sawing mark (Fig. 4). These incisions correspond to a repeated back-and-forth \nmovement, during which the edge of a flint tool remained in continuous contact with the bone surface. These can \nFigure 2. (a) Specimen QC-E8b-950-955 from Qesem Cave, the yellow square indicates the Micro-FTIR \nsampling point; (b) smooth flat polish, associated to bone working, developed over both the ventral and dorsal \nsurface of the tool; (c) Micro-FTIR spectra of the tool; (d) SEM image of the collagen fibre found over the \nventral surface of the tool.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n4\nScientific  REPORTS  | 6:37686 | DOI: 10.1038/srep37686\nbe interpreted as sawing marks since they also show the characteristic V-shaped section with a slight flat bottom, \noblique delineation, and internal micro-striations arranged lengthwise and parallel to the main movement axis.\nThe breakage characteristics (outline, fracture angle, and edge) of this bone specimen indicate a green (fresh) \nstage breakage. Nevertheless, jagged textures are also observable on two transverse and longitudinal breakage \nplanes of the bone, indicating that certain post-depositional processes (including different types of pressure load-\ning, such as trampling and/or soil compaction) may have affected it28. In addition, one cortical scar, documented \nnear the longitudinal bone edge, was likely produced during bone breakage for marrow extraction.\nThe sawing mark is partially located on one of the bone breakage planes (Figs 4A1 and A1c), and thus had to \nhave been generated after bone breakage. When a nutritional purpose for the processing is the case, the defleshing \n(and associated cut marks) takes place before bone breakage for marrow extraction. Once the bone is fragmented, \nlittle meat, if any, remains, and no further cutting is necessary. Thus, the most likely explanation in this case is \nthat the observed deep sawing mark is the result of a non-dietary action that occurred after the bone had been \nde-fleshed and marrow-processed for consumption. It is worth noting that we also detected a certain degree of \npolishing and rounding linked to taphonomic processes which affected the whole bone, such as light sedimen -\ntary abrasion by water flow29. In the case of the specimen presented here, this alteration is especially evident on \nthe sawing mark and the area around it (Figs 4A1, A1b, and Fig. 4B). We suggest that this relates to the presence \nof previous polishing in this area as a result of the sawing action, which was later augmented by the general \npost-depositional processes that acted upon it.\nIn order to further investigate the sawing mark identified on the archaeological specimen F/9c-735-740 a ded-\nicated experimental framework has been applied, utilising different types of flint tools to cut through both fresh \nFigure 3. (A) Collagen fiber trapped in a small fracture of the edge of the archaeological stone tool; (B) opaque \npatch of residue filling micro-depressions on the surfaces of the archaeological stone tool; (D) and (E) fibers and \nglobular residual concretions packed along the edge of experimental tools used for bone sawing.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n5\nScientific  REPORTS  | 6:37686 | DOI: 10.1038/srep37686\nand dry bones (for details, see Supplementary Information). The results of our experimental framework indicate \nthat the markings produced by bidirectional movements with angles that tend always to be similar, around 90°, \nregardless of the tool used and the condition of the bone. However, exploring the results in greater detail, some \nessential differences can be observed. The main difference concerns the resulting polishing and rounding of the \ncortical surfaces. The markings produced on dry bones are usually accompanied by a more pronounced degree \nof buffing, which exceeds the immediate boundaries of the mark and which can sometimes be accompanied by \nslight cortical notches. The other difference is the degree of inclination and opening of the walls of the mark’s \nsection, which depends on the type and edge of the tool used. Demi-Quina scrapers usually produce wider and \nmore inclined V-shaped sections.\nMoreover, analysis was performed on the polish developed on the experimental items, taking into account the \ntype of flint tool used and the state of the bone when the sawing was performed. Our experimental items showed \na slight polishing and rounding on the sawn area, as that observed on archaeological specimen F/9c-735-740, \nespecially when demi-Quina scrapers were used on de-fatted (dry) bones (see Supplementary Information: in \nparticular, Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S3).\nDiscussion\nEvidence related to specific activities such as carving and the cutting or scraping of bone, most likely for the \nproduction of bone tools, is scarcely known in early Palaeolithic contexts3,8,10. The innovative data presented here \nprovides the first evidence of bone working, through sawing, using a specific kind of flint tools. Our evidence \nis considerably different in nature from that which concerns the modification of bone through use or grinding \nFigure 4. Specimen QC-F9c-735-740 from Qesem Cave showing a sawing mark (A) with striations on one of \nthe fractured edges (marked by an arrow in A1 and A1c), internal micro-striations (A1) and certain degree of \npolishing and rounding (A1b). Note that the buffing is especially pronounced on the mark and the area around \nit (A, A1, B). The dashed green line and arrow in the picture B indicate possible secondary cuts corresponding \nto unintentional mistakes of accuracy similar to those observed experimentally (C). The image D shows a 3D \nreconstruction of the cortical area where the sawing mark is located (KH-8700 3D Digital Microscope), and the \npoints used for making the section and calculating the angle (E).\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n6\nScientific  REPORTS  | 6:37686 | DOI: 10.1038/srep37686\nactivities, suggested by several South African findings dating back to the Early Stone Age2,5. It also clearly differs \nfrom the shaping of tools (or flake knapping) of large animals’ bones, performed through flaking (e.g., using a \nhammerstone30,31), well known from the Lower Palaeolithic Acheulean.\nThe results of this study allow us to argue that at Qesem Cave, hominins were bringing selected body parts \nof hunted game to the cave and, after the meat, fat, and marrow were consumed, they occasionally used the \ndiscarded animal bones for non-dietary purposes. Had the bone been an isolated find, we would not easily rule \nout the possibility that the sawing mark was made accidentally. Y et with the current evidence of bone working \nuse-wear and bone residues on flint tools and the sawing mark, we can state that the Qesem hominins used the \nbone for a non-nutritional activity and this fact can be related to the inclusion of new materials in their chaîne \nopératoire. The data presented here represents an innovative behaviour, practised between 420 and 300 kya, pos-\nsibly the oldest evidence related to intentional non-dietary modification of bone through the use of specific stone \ntools. Moreover, our results are in perfect accordance with additional evidence related to a non-dietary exploita-\ntion of hard animal materials recorded at the site – i.e., the use of bone fragments as bone retouchers\n12.\nIn summary, the outstanding preservation and the application of an integrated multidisciplinary approach \nallowed us to identify direct and indirect evidence of bone working using stone tools at this early date. This \ndemonstrates that the technological knowledge traditionally regarded as an expression of the Middle-Upper \nPalaeolithic sapiens cognitive sphere – i.e., the production of objects made of animal bones – was present at \nQesem Cave. Our finds are significant to the debate of whether pre-sapiens hominins mastered bone tool produc-\ntion. Moreover, our results shift the debate significantly back in time, necessitating a reassessment of the evidence \nconsidered to document behavioural modernity\n1.\nMethods\nThe flint objects were analysed throughout the adoption of both low and high power approaches32. In our work, \na Nikon SMZ stereomicroscope, capable of magnification up to 7.5x and equipped with fibre optic lighting, was \nused to analyse edge damage; a Nikon Metallurgical microscope, capable of magnification up to 500x and with \nreflected lighting, was used to analyse micro wear. The infrared spectra of the stone tools were collected with a \nBruker Optic Alpha-R portable interferometer with an external reflectance head covering a circular area approx-\nimately 5 mm in diameter. The investigated spectral range was 7500–375 cm\n−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1 and 250 \nscans or more. The specimens were analysed both before and after being washed, along with a sample of the sed-\niments in which they were embedded (see Supplementary Figure S2).\nResidues were observed in situ  using a Leica 205 C stereo-microscope with LED lighting at magnifications \nfrom 10x to 165x. The nature of the residues was interpreted on the basis of their morpho-qualitative features \n(colour, appearance, inclusions, consistency, birefringence, etc.), through archaeological comparison33–36 as well \nas by evaluating a collection of comparative experimental residues. In particular, our reference collection included \nresidues produced while using flint implements to work bone and antler, natural as well as ochre-stained hide, \ntendons, wood, bark, siliceous plants, and adhesive compounds (e.g. beeswax, resin, bitumen, animal glues, etc.) \nused for hafting. SEM-EDS analysis of the residues was performed using a Hitachi TM3000-Tabletop Scanning \nElectron Microscope equipped with SWIFT ED3000 EDS probe.\nThe fossil and experimental bones were analysed using a stereo light microscope, with a magnification of \nup to 120x and equipped with an oblique cold light source, and an analytical FEI QUANTA 600 Environmental \nScanning Electron Microscope (ESEM), at a magnification of up to 300x operating in the low vacuum mode. \nThe specimens were then examined with a KH-8700 3D Digital Microscope, which uses high-intensity LED \noptics with a full HD monitor to reconstruct three-dimensional surfaces. The criteria used to diagnose the sawing \nmarks conformed to previously reported modifications in the taphonomic literature. Bone breakage planes were \nanalysed in terms of outline, fracture angle, and edge, according to the criteria described by Villa & Mahieu\n28. \nPost-depositional alterations were also analysed and included manganese oxide precipitation, surface geochemi-\ncal alteration, root etching, polishing, and rounding.\nReferences\n1.
