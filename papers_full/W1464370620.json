INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of China’s economy, many cities have suffered from a short supply of electricity, there-by causing many transformers to constantly transfer to cities. Due to limited areas and the need to consider the effect of noise on surroundings, newly built substations in urban areas or inner suburbs are often configured completely indoor [1, 2]. Nowadays, indoor substations have been popular in small and medium-sized cities. Transformers have a complex structure and high requirements for operating environments. How to discharge the large quantities of heat generated dur-ing transformer operation through ventilation in order to en-sure safe and stable transformer operation, is one of the ma-jor tasks of substation design [3, 4]. The main transformer rooms of indoor substations are characterized by large sizes and considerable heat dissipa-tion. After the incoming air is heated, the density of the air will decrease, thus generating bottom-up natural convection airflow due to temperature difference. Therefore, transformer rooms generally use down-supply up-return ventilation to cause the direction of the inlet and outlet airflow to be con-sistent with that of natural convection, thereby producing a longitudinal temperature gradient [5]. However, the design specifications for the ventilation and air conditioning of in-door substations [6] require that ventilation in transformer rooms should ensure that the temperature in areas for human    \n*Address correspondence to this author at the School of Mechanical and electronic Engineering, Nanchang University, Jiangxi, 330031, P.R.

Currently, studies on the ventilation design of transformer rooms of indoor substations have fo-cused on two aspects: to select and arrange ventilation equipment by calculating heat dissipation and ventilation as required by national and industry specifications [3] and to design different schemes using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, simulate velocity and temperature fields, and obtain the best scheme by analyzing the results [7-13]. Literature [7, 8] used CFD to study natural ventilation in buildings. Literature [9] used CFD methods to study indoor ventilation in industrial plants with waste heat. Literature [10-13] used CFD to analyze the design of ventilation schemes for underground and semi-underground substations. With the successful application of CFD in various fields, it will become a trend to use CFD to numerically simulate the air distribution for the ventilation of indoor substations in order to optimize the design of substations. This paper studied Main Transformer Room of an indoor substation in Nanchang City. By designing schemes with different air inlet and outlet positions, six ventilation schemes were proposed. CFD methods were used to numeri-cally simulate the six schemes. The indoor air distributions for the schemes were compared by analyzing the velocity and temperature fields according to the numerical simulation results. The advantages and disadvantages of the schemes were analyzed, and good schemes for air distribution for ventilation were obtained, providing a reference for engi-neering design.  \nNumerical Simulation of Ventilation The Open Automation and Control Systems Journal, 2015, Volume 7    631 \n2. PHYSICAL MODEL 2.1. Simplification of the Physical Model Two air inlets and two air outlets were designed for the transformer room. The transformer room was 9.8 m long, 8 m wide, and 13.8 m high. Table 1 gives the original data for the transformer room, showing that the full power load of the heat sources of the main transformer is 182.26 kW. At an ambient temperature of 33¥ in summer, it is difficult to rely on buoyancy-driven natural ventilation alone to remove in-door waste heat, and forced ventilation is often used. Table 2 shows the results calculated for forced ventilation. The x-coordinate was the length direction, the y-coordinate was the width direction, and the z-coordinate was the height direc-tion. The two air inlets were 0.8 m wide and 2 m high, and the two air outlets were 1.5 m × 1.5 m. Due to the complex external dimensions of transformers, it is difficult to simulate their structure when establishing physical models, and trans-formers are often simplified. When establishing the model, this paper used a cuboid that was 5 m long, 4 m wide, and 3 m high.  \n2.2. Physical Models for the Various Schemes for Ventila-tion Fig. (1) shows the six air inlet and outlet arrangement schemes for the main transformer room, where (a)~(c) are three air distribution schemes for ventilation with the same air inlet position (on the side of the main transformer) and different air outlet positions (in the front, middle, and rear of the top), and (d)~(f) are three air distribution schemes for ventilation with the same air outlet position (in the middle of the top) and different air inlet positions (on the two sides, in the front and rear). 3. MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND THE TREAT-MENT OF BOUNDARY CONDITIONS 3.1. Mathematical Model This paper studied three-dimensional steady-state incom-pressible turbulent flow [14]. The finite volume method was used to establish discrete equations. The second order up-wind scheme, the standard k-ε model [15], the segregated    \nTable 1. Original data for the transformer room.

The calcula-tion parameters were set as shown in Table 3. Considering the effect of temperature on density, the buoyancy force caused by temperature difference was approximated [16]. Basic control equations include continuity, momentum, and energy equations [17]. \n1) Continuity equation According to Reynolds assumptions, flow at any instant at each point in the flow field obeys the basic equation for continuum flow:   !\"/!t+!(\"u)/!x+!(\"v)/!y+!(\"w)/!z=0 (1) \n     (a) Scheme a     (b) Scheme b \n    (c) Scheme c     (d) Scheme d \n    (e) Scheme e      (f) Scheme f Fig. (1).

Treatment of Boundary Conditions 3.2.1. Wall Boundary Conditions A fixed heat flux was set at the wall of the transformer, and the transformer’s surface heat flux was 2,432 W/m2. The heat flux on surrounding walls was zero. Velocity, k, and ε were all zero. 3.2.2. Boundary Conditions for Air Inlets and Outlets The velocity inlet boundary condition was applied at the air inlets. According to ventilation requirements, the   \ninlet velocity was set at 4 m/s. Simple air inlets were used to replace complex air inlets for modeling. During simulation, the original outflow characteristics of the air inlet would be altered, but the consistency between the mass, momentum, and buoyancy flux of inflow and reality could be ensured in order to ensure the consistency between indoor air distribu-tion and actual air distribution [18]. The outdoor ambient temperature was 33°C. Outflow boundary conditions were applied at the air outlet. 4. SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 4.1. Simulation Results In order to compare the air distributions and ventilation effects of the various schemes, typical sections were selected for the different schemes. The velocity distributions in the section at a vertical height of 2 m (namely z=-4.9 m) and the temperature distributions in the section at a height of 5 m from the ground over the main transformer were analyzed and compared. The three-dimensional streamline charts for the ventilation schemes were used to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the air distributions of the schemes. In addition, in order to analyze the ventilation effects of the various schemes, the average temperatures at heights of 0.8 m, 1.5 m, and 2 m in the operating area were used as refer-ences to compare values. The velocity distributions in the section at a vertical height of 2 m (namely, z = -4.9 m) for the different schemes are shown in Fig. (2). Fig. (3) shows the three-dimensional streamline charts for the six ventilation schemes. Fig. (4) shows the temperature distributions in the section at a height of 5 m for the six ventilation schemes. Table 4 gives the val-ues for the average temperatures at heights of 0.8 m, 1.5 m, and 2 m in the operating area of the main transformer. 4.2. Analysis of the Simulation Results 4.2.1. Scheme a As indicated by the velocity and temperature distribu-tions for Scheme a, the jets at the air inlets carried surround-ing air to the opposite side and flowed forward and backward under the guidance of the airflow passages between the front and rear radiator fins of the main transformer and the front and rear walls. Airflow formed two relatively small vortexes between the two air inlets and whirlpools of air between the two jets and the front and rear walls while forming a large airflow dead zone between the main transformer and the wall    \nTable 4.

As shown in the three-dimensional streamline chart for Scheme a, air flowed straight upward through the passage from the front to the back and flowed out through the air outlets after entering the main transformer room through the air inlets. Therefore, large airflow dead zones existed in the bottom of the left side of the main transformer and above the air inlets (the right side of the main transformer). And the middle part of the air inlet side in the section at a height of 5 m was the highest temperature zone, indicating that Scheme a had good cooling effects on the air inlet and front and rear sides of the main transformer but had poor cooling effects on the opposite side of the air inlets and the left side of the main transformer.  \n4.2.2. Scheme b As indicated by the velocity and temperature distribu-tions for Scheme b, the section at a height of 2 m and tem-perature distribution for Scheme b were similar to those for Scheme a. However, as shown in the three-dimensional streamline chart, because the air outlets were located in the middle, air flowed to the opposite side of the air inlets (left side) after entering the main transformer room through the air inlets on the right side and then circled backwards and flowed to the air outlets on the top. Therefore, more air flowed to the left side of the main transformer when com-pared to Scheme a, indicating that Scheme b had good cool-ing effects on the air inlet and front and rear sides   \n\n638    The Open Automation and Control Systems Journal, 2015, Volume 7 Huijuan et al. of the main transformer and poor cooling effects on the op-posite side of the air inlets and the left side of the main trans-former, which, however, were better than Scheme a. 4.2.3. Scheme c As indicated by the velocity and temperature distribu-tions for Scheme c, the section at a height of 2 m and the temperature distribution in the section at a height of 5 m were similar to those for Scheme a. However, as shown in the three-dimensional streamline chart, because the air out-lets were located on the same side as the air inlets, air flowed to the opposite side after entering the main transformer room through the air inlets on the right side and then circled back-wards and flowed to the air outlets on the top. Therefore, more air flowed to the left side of the main transformer when compared to Scheme b, indicating that Scheme c had good cooling effects on the air inlet and front and rear sides of the main transformer. Seen from the velocity distribution, the air distribution on the air inlet side (right side) of the main trans-former was similar to that on the left side, indicating that the fullness of air on the left side approximated to that on the air inlet side. Therefore, the cooling effect on the leeward side improved, which is also indicated by the temperature distri-bution in the section at a height of 5 m for Scheme c, where the highest temperature zone moved to the center, indicating that cooling on the various sides of the transformer was more even for Scheme c. 4.2.4. Scheme d As indicated by the velocity and temperature distribu-tions for Scheme d, air formed four swirling centers between the two jets and the four walls, but the swirling centers were distant from the walls of the main transformer. Therefore, this scheme had few dead zones on the four walls of the main transformer as well as a good cooling effect. The three-dimensional streamline chart indicates that the fullness of air surrounding the main transformer was good for this scheme, thus facilitating ventilation. In addition, as indicated by the temperature distribution in the section at a height of 5 m over the main transformer, small symmetrical high-temperature zones formed at a distance of 2 m away from the correspond-ing walls above the air inlets, showing that the air distribu-tion for Scheme d was characterized by the staggered ar-rangement of the air inlets, the good fullness of air, the great distance of the air dead zones from the main transformer, and the even and effective cooling effects on the walls. 4.2.5. Scheme e As indicated by the velocity distribution in the section at a height of 2 m and the temperature distribution in the sec-tion at a height of 5 m for Scheme e, the air inlets were ar-ranged on the same side, which was similar to that for Scheme b. Therefore, the two schemes had similar air distri-bution characteristics and cooling effects. However, the air-flow blocking section of the main transformer (the section of the front in the airflow direction) for Scheme e was smaller than that for Scheme b. Therefore, the simulation results and distribution effects for Scheme e were better than those for Scheme b. However, the transformer was simplified to a \ncuboid for simulation. In practical engineering, the direction of the radiating fin should be consistent with the airflow di-rection, which will yield the smallest airflow blocking sec-tion and produce the best cooling effects. 4.2.6. Scheme f As indicated by the velocity distribution in the section at a height of 2 m and the temperature distribution in the sec-tion at a height of 5 m for Scheme f, the air inlets were stag-gered on the different sides of the main transformer, which was similar to that for Scheme d. Therefore, the two schemes had similar air distribution characteristics and cooling ef-fects. However, the airflow blocking section of the main transformer (the section of the front) for Scheme f was smaller than that for Scheme d. Therefore, the simulation results and distribution effects were better than those for Scheme b and were characterized by good fullness of air, the great distance of airflow dead zones from the main trans-former, and the even and effective cooling effects on the various walls. As shown by the above analysis of the velocity and tem-perature distributions and the numerical simulation results of temperature in the operating area for the various schemes, Schemes c, d, and f had low operating temperatures while the operating area temperatures for Schemes a, b, and e were 3~4°C higher than those for the above three schemes, there-by validating the above analysis results from another aspect. CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS The following conclusions were drawn from the above analysis: 1) The ventilation effects for Schemes c, d, and f were good, while the ventilation effects for Schemes a, b, and e were poor. 2) Under the condition of the convenient arrangement of the architectural structure of main transformer rooms, air inlets are advised to be staggered on opposite sides, which can increase the effective and even cooling of the main trans-former and reduce air dead zones. 3) If air inlets are only allowed to be arranged on the same side in practical buildings, air outlets should be ar-ranged on the same side as the air inlets in order to increase the distance over which air circles and the fullness of air in the main transformer room and improve the cooling effects of air on the leeward side of the main transformer.
