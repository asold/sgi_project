  "abstract": "Abstract Adaptivity is an essential trait of life. One type of adaptivity is the reconfiguration of a functional system states by correlating sensory inputs. We report polymer transformers, which can adaptively reconfigure their composition from a state of a mixed copolymer to being enriched in either monomer A or B. This is achieved by embedding and hierarchically interconnecting two chemically fueled activation/deactivation enzymatic reaction networks for both monomers via a joint activation pathway (network level) and an AB linker monomer reactive to both A and B (species level). The ratio of enzymes governing the individual deactivation pathways (our external signals) control the enrichment behavior in the dynamic state. The method shows high programmability of the reconfigured state, rejuvenation of transformation cycles, and quick in situ adaptation. As a proof‐of‐concept, we showcase this dynamic reconfiguration for colloidal surface functionalities.",
