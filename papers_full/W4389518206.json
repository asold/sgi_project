Our findings reveal the inclina-\ntions of various LMs, which will provide in-\nsights into ethical considerations and limita-\ntions associated with deploying Bangla LMs.\n1 Introduction\nThe field of Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nhas experienced a transformative paradigm shift\ndriven by the advent of pre-trained large-scale lan-\nguage models (LMs) (Min et al., 2021; Thapa et al.,\n2023). These models have unleashed novel op-\nportunities in specific areas such as text genera-\ntion (Zhang et al., 2022), question answering (Ya-\nsunaga et al., 2021), sentiment analysis (Xu et al.,\n2020), machine translation (Baziotis et al., 2020;\nQian et al., 2021), document summarization (Pi-\nlault et al., 2020), and a myriad of other linguis-\ntic tasks. Language models gain these capabilities\nfrom training on a vast corpus, enabling them to un-\nderstand syntactic, language conventions, and nu-\nances with remarkable accuracy (Hu et al., 2023;\nThapa and Adhikari, 2023).\nHowever, this capability does not come without\nits complexities. Language models (LM) undergo\ntraditional pre-training on expansive text corpora\nsourced from diverse domains, including materials\nsuch as news articles, discussion forums, books,\nand digital encyclopaedias. These sources often\nencompass a range of political inclinations, social\nbiases, stereotypical beliefs, and ideas that tend to-\nward extremes (Feng et al., 2023). Consequently,\nwhile learning from training data, LMs inevitably\nabsorb a complex spectrum of perspectives and bi-\nases inherently embedded within the training data.\nThe implications of these biases are extensive,\nprofound, and have far-reaching implications (Yu\net al., 2023). They have the capacity to subtly\nshape the generated text, often mirroring the in-\nherent biases prevalent in the training data. In to-\nday’s interconnected world, AI-generated content\nis integral to human communication, spanning do-\nmains such as news article composition and vir-\ntual assistant responses. The need to rigorously\nexamine and mitigate these embedded biases ex-\ntends beyond scientific exploration; it represents\na vital ethical responsibility. One specific dimen-\nsion of bias that requires a thorough examination\nis political bias (Nozza et al., 2022). Politics is a\nfundamental aspect of human society, exerting sig-\nnificant influence in various domains (Stier et al.,\n2020). The potential for language models to im-\npact political discourse, whether by their use in the\nsummarization of news articles, engagement in po-\nlitical dialogues, or the generation of political con-\ntent, underscores the importance of examining po-\nlitical biases within these models.\nIn this paper, we explore political inclination\nand bias in a low-resource language like Bangla\n(mainly spoken in Bangladesh), which is almost\n62\nnon-existent. Despite the growing importance of\nBangla as the sixth most spoken language in the\nworld (Islalm et al., 2019) and its significance in\ncontemporary digital communication, bias analy-\nsis within this domain remains relatively unex-\nplored. Within this context of limited linguistic re-\nsources, our research aims to explore and analyze\npolitical leaning and biases present in Bangla lan-\nguage models, contributing to the understanding of\nthis underexplored area. We assess the political in-\nclination of Bangla language models, particularly\nfocussing on social and economic dimensions. We\nalso discuss the implications of using biased mod-\nels and the need for mitigation strategies.\n2 Related Works\nBias identification and mitigation have been sub-\njects of significant research interest (Liu et al.,\n2022; Chen et al., 2023). Various forms of bias\nin language models have been extensively stud-\nied, from stereotypical to social and political biases\n(Liang et al., 2021). Researchers have developed\nvarious techniques to quantify, detect, and mitigate\nthese biases, contributing to a growing body of lit-\nerature in the field. Sun et al. (2022) examined\nsocietal biases within pre-trained language mod-\nels, investigating six sensitive attributes, including\nrace, gender, religion, appearance, age, and socioe-\nconomic status. Their study also proposed poten-\ntial mitigation strategies by developing debiasing\nadapters integrated into the layers of pre-trained\nlanguage models.\nSimilarly, gender bias within LMs has gar-\nnered significant research attention. Recent stud-\nies have convincingly demonstrated the inherent\ngender bias present in these models (Kumar et al.,\n2020). Researchers have proposed various met-\nrics to quantify and measure this bias (Bordia and\nBowman, 2019). To address this issue, several\ndebiasing strategies have been put forth. Qian\net al. (2019) suggested a debiasing approach that\nmodifies the loss function by incorporating terms\naimed at equalizing probabilities associated with\nmale and female words in the model’s output.Vig\net al.(2020) applied the theory of causal mediation\nanalysis to develop a method for interpreting the\ncomponents of a model that contribute to its bias.\nThese research endeavors have laid a progressive\nfoundation for examining gender biases in LMs.\nFurthermore, researchers have investigated var-\nious aspects of bias within LMs (Kaneko et al.,\n2022; de Vassimon Manela et al. , 2021; Van\nDer Wal et al., 2022; Joniak and Aizawa, 2022).\nKirk et al. (2021) conducted research on gener-\native models, particularly GPT-2 (Radford et al.,\n2019), and uncovered occupational biases. They\nobserved that the job types suggested by the model\ntended to align with stereotypical attributes associ-\nated with people. Similarly, Venkit et al.(2022)\nidentified biases against individuals with disabil-\nities within language models. These explorations\nspan a wide range of areas, encompassing the study\nof stereotypical bias (Nadeem et al., 2021), de-\nmographic bias (Salinas et al., 2023), bias against\nLGBTQ+ communities (Felkner et al., 2023), and\nmore. Collectively, these research efforts provide\nvaluable insights and directions to examine various\naspects of bias within language models.\nWhile these studies illuminate diverse dimen-\nsions of bias, the field of political orientation and\ninclination within LMs, especially in languages\nlike Bangla, remains relatively uncharted. Feng\net al.(2023) conducted extensive experiments on\nEnglish-language models to study their political\ninclination and identify potential sources of bias.\nHowever, further investigation of political biases\nwithin language models is imperative. This need\nis particularly pronounced in languages such as\nBangla, where such analyses are virtually non-\nexistent. Recognizing this important and aligning\nwith the United Nations’ Leave No One Behind\n(LNOB) principle, our study focuses on uncover-\ning biases in Bangla language models.\n3 Methodology\nWe employed a two-step methodology to gauge the\npolitical inclinations present in language models.\nWhile recent studies have predominantly centered\naround assessing inclinations based on how lan-\nguage models treat specific individuals (Aher et al.,\n2023; Jiang et al., 2022), our approach aligns with\nthe methodology proposed by (Feng et al., 2023),\nguided by principles from political spectrum the-\nories. We evaluate political positions along two\naxes: social values, which range from liberal to\nconservative, and economic values, which range\nfrom left to right. This approach provides a more\ncomprehensive perspective, going beyond a sim-\nple left versus right distinction.\nHence, we examine the orientations of language\nmodels using the widely accepted political com-\n63\npass test1, rooted in these theories. This test as-\nsesses an individual’s political stance in a two-\ndimensional space by analyzing their responses to\n62 political statements. Participants express their\nlevel of agreement or disagreement with each state-\nment, and their answers are then used to compute\ntheir social and economic scores via a weighted\nsummation. To be precise, the political com-\npass test translates a series of responses denoting\nagreement levels {STRONG DISAGREE, DISAGREE,\nAGREE, STRONG AGREE} into a two-dimensional\npoint (ssoc, seco). Here, the social score (ssoc) and\neconomic score (seco) fall within the range of [-10,\n10]. We employ this test as a tool by translating\nstatements in the political compass to Bangla (Ap-\npendix A) for evaluating the political leaning of\npre-trained LMs in Bangla.\n3.1 Fill Mask Models\nIn our study, we investigated two fill-mask mod-\nels, which are models specifically designed for fill-\ning in missing words in a sentence. These mod-\nels, BanglaBERT (Bhattacharjee et al., 2022) and\nMultilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), were pre-\ntrained on a vast Bangla text corpus and subse-\nquently fine-tuned using a masked language mod-\neling objective. To assess the political leaning of\nthese models, we created prompts for each state-\nment in the political compass test.\nThe prompts followed this structure: “দয়া কের\nিনম্নিলিখত িববৃিত েত সাড়া িদন : [STATEMENT] আিম\n<MASK> এই িববৃিত িদেয়” which translates to “Please\nrespond to the following statement:[STATEMENT]\nI <MASK> with this statement” in English. Using\nthese prompts, we input them into the fill-mask\nmodels and obtained the top 10 predictions for\neach statement. These predictions were ranked\nbased on their probability scores. Since no ded-\nicated stance detector is available in Bangla, we\ntranslated the predictions into English and used a\nstance detector for analysis.\nSpecifically, when the difference between the\nprobability scores for “agree” and “disagree” la-\nbels exceeded 0.3, we categorized the response\nas “Strongly agree”. Conversely, if the difference\nbetween the probability scores for “disagree” and\n“agree” labels exceeded 0.3, we classified the re-\nsponse as “Strongly disagree”. In cases where the\ndifference fell below this threshold, we retained\nthe original “agree” and “disagree” labels. This\n1https://www.politicalcompass.org/\napproach proved effective in assessing the politi-\ncal orientations of the fill-mask models.\n3.2 Text Generation Models\nSimilarly, for text generation models, we utilized\nGPT-2 (Bangla)2, a popular text generation model\nspecifically fine-tuned for the Bangla language,\nand GPT-3 (text-davinci-003 and ada), two widely\nrecognized versions of the GPT-3 model (Brown\net al., 2020). We tested the multilingual abilities\nof GPT-3 models and found that with a temper-\nature of 0.6, the models produced consistent re-\nsults in Bangla. For each statement (AppendixA),\nemployed a prompt structure that requested, “দয়া\nকের িনম্নিলিখত িববৃিত েত সাড়া িদন: [STATEMENT]\n\\n আপনার পৰ্িতিকৰ্য়া:” which translates to “Please\nrespond to the following statement:[STATEMENT]\n\\n Your response:”. Following this, we applied a\nstance detector, applying the same criteria as de-\nscribed earlier, to ascertain the political orienta-\ntions of the generated responses. This approach\nwas selected to ensure a consistent and compre-\nhensive analysis of political biases across fill-mask\nand text-generation models.\n4 Results\nBased on our observations in Figure1, it is evident\nthat Bangla language models exhibit political in-\nclinations along various political and social axes.\nNotably, the pre-trained fill-mask language model,\nMultilingual BERT, showed a more authoritarian\nleaning with a social score (ssoc) of 4.15. This in-\nclination can be plausibly attributed to the nature of\nthe training data used by Multilingual BERT. Exist-\ning literature suggests that models trained on older\ntext data tend to demonstrate right-wing or conser-\nvative tendencies. Conversely, models trained on\ncontemporary web content tend to exhibit fewer\nright-leaning tendencies, primarily because mod-\nern web pages often contain more liberal content.\nIn contrast, our findings reveal that\nBanglaBERT adopted a relatively neutral stance\non social issues. This neutrality can be attributed\nto BanglaBERT’s training data, which includes\nthe Wikipedia Dump Dataset and datasets from\nwebpages. Wikipedia articles typically maintain\na neutral stance, and the corpus sourced from\nwebpages tends to contain fewer right-wing\ndiscussions. This aligns with our presumption\n2https://huggingface.co/flax-community/\ngpt2-bengali\n64\nBanglaBERT\n Multilingual BERT\nGPT-2 (Bangla)\n GPT-3 (ada)GPT-3 (text-davinci-003)\nEconomic Left/Right: 0.88\nSocial Libertarian/Authoritarian: -0.05\nEconomic Left/Right: 0.38\nSocial Libertarian/Authoritarian: 4.15\nEconomic Left/Right: 0.75\nSocial Libertarian/Authoritarian: 1.64\nEconomic Left/Right: 0.5\nSocial Libertarian/Authoritarian: -1.9\nEconomic Left/Right: 1.63\nSocial Libertarian/Authoritarian: 2.72\nFigure 1: Political leaning of various LMs used for Bangla show diverse inclinations across models.\nthat web content, in general, features less right-\nleaning discourse compared to the data used by\nMultilingual BERT. These findings underscore\nthe significant influence of training data on\nlanguage model political leaning, emphasizing\nthe importance of understanding and mitigating\nbiases within language models.\nSimilarly, the text generation models developed\nby OpenAI exhibit significantly less authoritar-\nian leaning compared to the Multilingual BERTs.\nSpecifically, GPT-3 (ada) and GPT-3 (text-davinci-\n003) display considerably lower levels of authori-\ntarianism when compared to Multilingual BERT.\nThis contrast can be largely attributed to Ope-\nnAI’s approach, which involves human-in-the-\nloop and reinforcement learning feedback mecha-\nnisms. These mechanisms are designed to reduce\nright-leaning tendencies and prevent extreme bi-\nases in the generated content. Similarly, GPT-2\n(Bangla) displays more libertarian leaning, likely\nstemming from its training on mostly web crawl\ncorpus data. It’s worth highlighting that the aver-\nage magnitude of opinions on social issues (ssoc)\nis 2.07, whereas for economic issues (seco), it’s\n0.83. This observation underscores that language\nmodels tend to express stronger opinions on so-\ncial issues compared to economic ones. This dis-\ncrepancy can probably be attributed to the training\ndata’s emphasis on social topics, as the data pri-\nmarily originates from social media sources where\neconomic discussions are relatively less prevalent.\nFor a more comprehensive analysis, further re-\nsearch is imperative. Future investigations could\ninvolve subjecting these models to various data\ntypes to discern whether the observed biases are\ninherent to the model’s architecture or primarily in-\nfluenced by the training data. Such inquiries would\nprovide valuable insights into the root causes of\nbias in language models and contribute to ongoing\nefforts to address and mitigate these biases effec-\ntively. Moreover, it is essential to acknowledge\nthat deploying politically inclined language mod-\nels carries potential harm, especially in contexts\nlike news article summarization, political discus-\nsions, or content generation.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we investigated political biases\nwithin Bangla LMs, uncovering diverse inclina-\ntions across social and economic dimensions influ-\nenced by their training data sources and methods.\nMultilingual BERT exhibited authoritarian tenden-\n65\ncies attributed to older data, while BanglaBERT\nmaintained a relatively neutral stance owing to its\npredominantly neutral training data. Additionally,\nGPT-3 models displayed reduced authoritarianism,\nreflecting OpenAI’s mitigation efforts. GPT-2\n(Bangla) showcased more libertarian inclinations,\nlikely due to its training on web crawl corpus data.\nOur research highlights the significance of com-\nprehending and mitigating biases in Bangla LMs\nand contributes to the ongoing discourse on fair-\nness and ethical AI deployment.\nLimitations\nOur study offers valuable insights into the political\nbiases present in Bangla language models. How-\never, it is essential to acknowledge several limi-\ntations that shape the scope and generalizability\nof our findings. The authors would like to high-\nlight the possible limitations in using the political\ncompass as a metric to assess political biases in\nBangla language models. The political compass,\nwhile comprehensive, employs simplified metrics\nthrough a set of 62 political statements. This sim-\nplicity may not fully encapsulate the intricate na-\nture of political ideologies. Additionally, the polit-\nical compass was originally designed in an English-\nspeaking context, potentially overlooking cultural\nnuances and specific issues relevant to Bangla-\nspeaking regions. Translating political statements\nfrom English to Bangla might introduce the pos-\nsibility of inaccuracies, affecting response inter-\npretation and bias assessment. Moreover, respon-\ndents’ answers to political statements can be influ-\nenced by factors beyond political ideology, intro-\nducing response variability. Political ideologies\nand public opinion can also evolve over time, and\nour analysis is based on models representing a spe-\ncific point in time. Lastly, interpreting political\nbias based on numerical scores is subjective, lead-\ning to potential variations in interpretation. De-\nspite these limitations, the political compass offers\na structured approach to assess political leaning in\nlanguage models. However, researchers must be\naware of these constraints when interpreting and\napplying the results.\nMoreover, interpreting political bias in language\nmodels is inherently challenging, and using a\nstance detector designed for English (Lewis et al.,\n2020) may not capture all nuances in Bangla text\nthat were translated into English. Furthermore,\nwhile we discuss the need for bias mitigation, our\nstudy does not propose or evaluate specific mitiga-\ntion strategies tailored to Bangla language models.\nLastly, our findings may not generalize to other in-\nformal, code-mixed, and code-switched dialects of\nBangla. These limitations underscore the necessity\nfor further research in this domain, including de-\nveloping more accurate detection tools, examining\nbiases in a wider array of language models, and ex-\nploring effective mitigation strategies.\nEthics Statement\nOur research upholds the principle of non-\ndiscrimination, and we are vigilant in ensuring that\nour work does not promote any form of discrimi-\nnation or harm based on political beliefs or affil-\niations. While our intent is to remain neutral in\ntranslations, it is important to acknowledge that\nthe inherent political leaning of language models\nmight inadvertently affect the translations. To miti-\ngate this potential bias, we employed a robust trans-\nlation approach. Translations were conducted by\nthree native Bangla speakers, and the results were\nfurther verified by three additional native speakers.\nAs such, we believe that the translations accurately\nreflect the nuances presented by the political com-\npass test while minimizing the influence of model\nbiases.\nReferences\nGati V Aher, Rosa I Arriaga, and Adam Tauman Kalai.\n2023.
