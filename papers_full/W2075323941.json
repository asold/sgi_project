The suitable condition to expand the graphite is\nfound to be over 700\n°C for 15 min, and the reactive salt is impregnated by immersing the expanded\ngraphite in the reactive salt solution. The performance of the heat transformer using the composite reac-\ntive block is accordingly simulated. It is found that the gas volume has quite important effect on the\nmatching of the reacting rates and consequently it affects the system performance. The system COP is\nhigher in the case of small gas volume, in particular when the driven temperature is high.\nIntroduction\nWith the development of economy, the environ-\nment protection and the energy conservation become\nthe focus of public attention. These concerns urge the\nresearchers to explore the renewable energy source,\nsuch as solar energy and geothermal energy, and to\nrecover the exhausted energy, which is mainly in the\nform of industrial waste heat. However, the wide and\neffective utilization of these heat sources is limited\nbecause their temperatures are always very low. Thus,\nit is considered that more valuable use can be realized\nby lifting the temperatures of these heat sources.\nThough the heat transformer based on solid–gas\nreaction (for example, chloride-ammonia) can be used\nfor uplifting the temperature, the system COP is small.\nIt has been proved by the experimental and theoretical\nanalysis that the system COP is limited by the poor\nperformance of the heat and mass transfer (Sun et al.,\n1995; Menard et al ., 2005). Many researchers have\nproposed the reactive block with enhanced heat and/or\nmass transfer performance. As in most cases, the sys-\ntem performance is limited by the heat transfer proc ess,\nand only when the system pressure is low enough, e.g.,\nlower than 0.01 MPa, system performance is limited\nby the mass transfer process (Mbaye et al ., 1998). Lu\net al. (1996) proposed a procedure to fabricate the re-\nactive block (IMPEX) with enhanced heat transfer per-\nformance. However, in Lu’s procedure, vacuum dry-\ning is needed, which is obviously not desirable.\nOliveira (2006) proposed another procedure with no\nneed of vacuum drying to fabricate the reactive block,\nwhich was proved with enhanced heat transfer perform-\nance. But it seems that the distribution of the reactive\nsalt in the reactive block is not uniform in some cases.\nIn the single-stage heat transformer, there are gen-\nerally two kinds of the reactive blocks in the two reac-\ntors. Gas space exists in the system and the system\nperformance is influenced by the gas volume which is\nthe free space above reactive blocks. However, this is\nnot well understood, yet.\nIn this paper, a new procedure for fabricating the\nreactive block is proposed and accordingly the test is\ncarried out. The influences of the gas volume on the\nmatching of the reacting rates and the system perform-\nance are theoretically analyzed.\n1. Reactive Block\n1.1 Fabrication procedure of the reactive block\nThe reactive block is made of the expanded graph-\nite and reactive salt. The new procedure proposed to\nfabricate the reactive block is described as following:\nthe graphite is expanded at a set expansion tempera-\nture for a certain duration; and the expanded graphite\nis compressed into matrix; the expanded graphite ma-\ntrix is immersed into the salt solution; and the reactive\nblock is then formed by drying the expanded graphite\nmatrix impregnated with the salt in the environment\nof inert gas, e.g., nitrogen gas. The apparent density of\nthe expanded graphite matrix is the mass in a unit vol-\nume, which can be controlled by compressing proper\namount of the expanded graphite into a fixed volume.\n1276 JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING OF JAPAN\n1.2 Test results of the reactive block\nIn the reactive block, the reactive salt is impreg-\nnated into the expanded graphite. Therefore, the ex-\npansion of the graphite, which is affected by the ex-\npansion temperature and expansion duration, plays\nquite crucial role for the reactive block. It is shown in\nFigure 1  that the apparent density of the expanded\ngraphite varies little when the expansion temperature\nis over 500 °C and the expansion duration is over\n15 min. The structure of the expanded graphite is fur-\nther observed with SEM (Scanning Electronic Micro-\nscope).\nFigure 2  shows the structure of the expanded\ngraphite. It is seen from the figure that the shapes of\nthe expanded graphite are similar and look like a\n“worm” at temperature over 300 °C, as shown in Fig-\nures 2(a) and (b), which indicates that the graphite has\nbeen fully expanded. The graphite still remains flake\nshape when the expansion temperature is below 300 °C.\nThe completely expanded graphite will help the im-\npregnation of the salt. Therefore, the expansion tem-\nperature and the expansion duration are taken as 700 °C\nand 15 min to make sure the graphite is expanded com-\npletely. The apparent density of the fully expanded\ngraphite is estimated to be about 10 kg/m\n3, and the pore\nsize is measured with the nitrogen gas adsorption, and\nthe results are shown in Table 1.\nThe expanded graphite matrix is made by com-\npressing the powder into block, and used for the heat\ntransfer enhancement. Han et al. (1998) measured the\nthermal conductivity of the expanded graphite matrix\nwith different apparent density. It is shown that the\nthermal conductivity increases sharply with the appar-\nent density of the expanded graphite block. Compared\nwith the thermal conductivity of salt powder of about\n0.1–0.2 W/m/K (Wang et al ., 2006), the heat transfer\nperformance can be significantly enhanced with the\nexpanded graphite matrix. However, it should be men-\ntioned that with the increase of the apparent density of\nthe expanded graphite matrix, the permeability de-\ncreases a lot (Goetz et al ., 1997), which may lead to\nthe mass transfer problem, in particular in the case of\nsynthesis at low pressure. Therefore, the apparent den-\nsity of the expanded graphite matrix should not be too\nlarge to deteriorate the mass transfer. The apparent\ndensity of the expanded graphite matrix in this paper\nto make the reactive block is estimated to be 200–300\nkg/m\n3, and the thermal conductivity along the direc-\ntion perpendicular to the compression is measured to\nbe around 12 W/m/K.\nThe reactive block is made by impregnation of the\nsalt into the expanded graphite matrix. In this test, salt\nof SrCl\n2 as an example is impregnated into the ex-\npanded graphite. The structure of the block after the\nimpregnation of the salt is observed with BEC (back-\nscattered electron composition) and analyzed by EDS\n(energy X-ray dispersive spectrometry). The results are\nshown in Figure 3 . The bright area in the image is the\nSBET VT Average pore width [ Å ]\n[m\n2\n/g] [cm\n3\n/g] Adsorption by BET Adsorption by BJH Desorption by BJH\n30.4027 0.095104 125.1254 107.152 99. 766\nTable 1 Pore size of the expanded graphite (700 °C for 15 min)\nFig. 1 Apparent density of the expanded graphite with\ndifferent expansion temperatures and different ex-\npansion durations Fig. 2 Structure of the expanded graphite at different tem-\nperatures ( ×100): (a) 500 °C; (b) 400 °C; (c) 300 °C;\n(d) unexpanded graphite\nVOL. 40 NO. 13 2007 1277\nsalt, and the shadow area is the expanded graphite. It\nis clear that the block is impregnated with the salt,\nwhich is also confirmed from EDS. The weight frac-\ntion of the salt in the composite reactive block shown\nin Figure 3 is estimated to be about 40%. With the in-\ncrease of the salt concentration, more salt is impreg-\nnated into the expanded graphite matrix. Therefore, the\nweight fraction of the salt in the reactive block in-\ncreases. It is also seen from Figure 3 that the salt in the\nreactive block is uniformly distributed, and rests be-\ntween the flakes of the expanded graphite. The salt in\nthe reactive block is in the form of small crystals, which\nis in favor of the reaction between the salt and gas.\nBecause the salt is separated by the flakes of the ex-\npanded graphite, the agglomeration can be avoided.\nThe SEM image of the composite reactive block\nmade by the above procedure and that of IMPEX\n(Mauran et al ., 2001; Olives and Mauran, 2001) are\nshown in Figure 4 . The area surrounded by black line\nin the two images is the space between flakes of ex-\npanded graphite and is filled with salt. Comparing the\nimages in Figure 4, it is found that the present com-\nposite reactive block has similar micro-scale structure\nto the block IMPEX. The small difference between two\nimages is due to different salts impregnated in two\nblocks. Since the thermal conductivity and gas perme-\nability of the reactive block are mainly determined by\nthe micro-scale structure. It is believed that the ther-\nmal conductivity and the gas permeability of the block\nmade by the procedure proposed in this paper should\nbe close to those of the IMPEX block, which are in the\nrange of 5 –20 W/m/K and 10\n–15–10–16 m2, respectively.\nTherefore, the heat and mass transfer can be enhanced,\nand consequently the system performance can be im-\nproved by applying the composite reactive block to the\nheat transformer. The following section devotes to the\nanalysis of the system performance of heat transformer\nusing the composite reactive block.\n2. System Performance Analysis and Improve-\nment\nSystem performance is analyzed for single-stage\nheat transformer, which is composed of two reactors\nfilled with the composite reactive blocks. And the space\nin the system excluding the composite reactive blocks\nis named as the gas volume. The principle of the sys-\ntem operation is shown in Figure 5. The salts are MnCl\n2\nand CaCl 2 and the reactive gas is NH 3. The system op-\neration is composed of two processes: the high pres-\nsure process and the low pressure process. During the\nlow pressure process at P\nL, the MnCl 2·6NH3 decom-\nposes at TM and CaCl 2·2NH3 synthesis at TL; and dur-\ning the high pressure process at PH, CaCl 2·4NH3 de-\ncomposes at TM and the MnCl 2·2NH3 synthesis at TH.\nThe temperature lifting is realized by the synthesis of\nMnCl\n2 at the high pressure.\nIt is assumed that the process stops when the re-\naction degree reaches 0.9 in the synthesis process or\n0.1 in the decomposition process. Lumped parameters,\nsuch as, the temperatures and the reaction degrees in\nthe two reactors, the amount and temperature of gas,\nand the system pressure are calculated by the follow-\ning equations.\nThe temperature of the reactive block is described\nas\nmC T\nt NH x\nt UA T T⋅() =⋅⋅ + ⋅ ⋅ − () ()p s\ns\ncs\nd\nd\nd\nd 1\nFig. 3 EDS analysis results of the reactive block: BEC\nobservation ×2000; salt concentration of the solu-\ntion: 23%\nFig. 4 The SEM images of the composite reactive block\nand IMPEX: (a) composite reactive block, ×500,\nthe salt is SrCl 2; (b) IMPEX (Olives and Mauran,\n2001), the salt is MnCl 2\nFig. 5 The principle of the system operation in Clausius –\nClapeyron diagraph\n1278 JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING OF JAPAN\nwhere, U is the heat transfer coefficient between the\nblock and the heat transfer fluid, and is about 300\nW/m\n2/K for both two blocks.\nThe reaction degrees during process of synthesis\nand decomposition are formulated respectively as (Han\net al., 2000; Oliveira, 2006)\nd\nd\nx\nt ax P\nP\nb\n=⋅− () ⋅−\n \n ()11\neq\n2a\nd\nd\nx\nt ax P\nP\nb=⋅ ⋅ − \n \n ()1\neq\n2b\nwhere Peq represents the equilibrium pressure of the\nsolid–gas reaction, and is described as\nP H\nRT\nS\nR\neq\ns\n2c=− ⋅ +\n \n ()exp 1\nThe amount of the reactive gas is determined by\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nn\nt N x\nt N x\nt=− ⋅\n\n\n +⋅\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ()\nsyn dec\n3\nand Eq.

Thus, T\ndec equals Ts in the reactor\nfilled with CaCl 2 during high pressure process; while\nit equals Ts in the reactor with MnCl 2 during low pres-\nsure process.\nWith Eqs. (1) –(5), system operation processes are\nsimulated in the cases of two different gas volumes. In\nthe simulation, the higher temperature reactor with\nMnCl\n2 exchanges heat with a heat source of 120 °C.\nThe analytical results are shown in Figures 6 –10.\nTo analyze the influence of the gas volume on the\nsystem performance, the variation of the reacting rates\nin the two reactors and the variation of the system pres-\nsure with time are calculated by taking the driven waste\nheat temperature T\nM of 120 °C, if not specified. And\nthe system performance is compared in the cases of\ntwo gas volumes: small gas volume and large gas vol-\nume representing the system with the gas volume as\n0.5 and 5 times of the volume of the total composite\nreactive blocks, respectively. And the volumes of the\nCaCl\n2 and MnCl 2 composite reactive blocks of 0.25 m 3\nand 0.12 m 3 are used in this study.\nThe variation of the reacting rate with the time is\nshown in Figure 6. It is seen from Figure 6(a) that the\nreacting rate of CaCl\n2 is larger than that of MnCl 2,\nwhich indicates that the reacting rates of MnCl 2 and\nCaCl2 do not match at all in the case of large gas vol-\nume. However, the reacting rates of CaCl 2 and MnCl 2\nin the system with small gas volume are nearly the\nsame, as shown in Figure 6(b). The reacting rate of\nFig. 6 V ariation of the reacting rates of CaCl 2 and MnCl 2:\n(a) large gas volume; (b) small gas volume\nFig. 7 Variation of the reaction degrees of CaCl 2 and\nMnCl2: (a) large gas volume; (b) small gas volume\nVOL. 40 NO. 13 2007 1279\nMnCl2 is larger in the system with small gas volume.\nSince the synthesis process of MnCl 2 is an exothermic\nprocess, the increased reacting rate of MnCl 2 in the\ncase of small gas volume will lead to higher tempera-\nture of MnCl\n2.\nThe operation cycle is assumed to start at t = 0\nwhen the initial reaction degree of CaCl 2 is 1, and the\ninitial reaction degree of MnCl 2 is 0. It is found that it\ntakes less time for the system with large gas volume to\nfinish one cycle. In a period of 5000 s, as shown in\nFigures 7(a) and (b), the system with large gas volume\nfinishes 4 cycles; while the system with small gas vol-\nume only finishes 2 cycles. The reaction degrees of\nCaCl\n2 in the cases of large and small gas volumes both\nchange from 0.1 to 0.9. The reaction degree of MnCl 2\nin the system with large gas volume changes from 0.3\nto 0.5, while it changes from 0.1 to 0.9 in the system\nwith small gas volume. It is shown in Figure 6 that the\nreacting rates of MnCl\n2 and CaCl 2 match well in the\ncase of small gas volume. While in the case of large\ngas volume, the reacting rates are unmatched. There-\nfore, it is concluded that the gas volume in the system\nhas adjusting effect on the balance of the reacting rates.\nAlthough the synthesis rate of MnCl\n2 increases in the\ncase of small gas volume, the decomposition rate of\nCaCl\n2 decreases as shown in Figure 6. Since the varia-\ntion of the reaction degrees of CaCl 2 in the cases of\nlarge and small gas volume are the same, the system\ncycle period in the case of small gas volume is longer,\nand the system COP is larger, due to the larger varia-\ntion of the reaction degree of MnCl\n2.\nThe variations of the temperature of MnCl 2 and\nthe system pressure during the system operation are\nshown in Figure 8. The system pressure changes dras-\nFig. 8 V ariation of the temperature of MnCl 2 and the sys-\ntem pressure with time: (a) the temperature of\nMnCl\n2; (b) the system pressure\nFig. 10 Variation of maximum temperature of MnCl 2\nFig. 9 Influences of the gas volume on the system power\nand system COP\ntically at the moment of large variation of the reacting\nrate. The system pressure in the system with small gas\nvolume changes more than that in the system with large\ngas volume. However, during most periods of the sys-\ntem operation, the system pressure in the system with\nsmall gas volume keeps nearly constant, which is due\nto the matched reacting rates in the system. Conse-\nquently, the temperature of MnCl\n2 changes, as shown\nin Figure 8(a).\nCOP Q\nQQ= +\n()out_MnCl\nin_CaCl in_MnCl\n2\n22\n6a\nPower 6b\nout_MnCl\nsystem_operation\n2= ()Q\nt\nThe influences of gas volume on the system power\nand system COP, which are calculated by Eq. (6) for\ndifferent cases, are shown in Figure 9. It is found that\nwith the increase of gas volume, the system power and\nsystem COP decrease, especially in the case of higher\ndriven temperature. The large system power in the case\nof small gas volume, in spite of long cycle time, is due\n1280\nto the fact that the temperature in reactor with MnCl 2\nis higher. However, it should be pointed out that the\nresult is obtained under the conditions studied in this\npaper. There may be other factors that have influences\non system performance, such as initial charging pres-\nsure of NH\n3 and system configuration. The detailed\neffects of these influential factors on the system per-\nformance will be studied in the future.\nWith the increase of the driven waste heat tem-\nperature T\nM, the decomposition rate of CaCl 2 increases,\nconsequently, the synthesis rate of MnCl 2 also in-\ncreases. The adjusting effect of smaller gas volume on\nthe balance of the reacting rates is stronger. Therefore,\nthe synthesis rate of MnCl\n2 in system with small gas\nvolume is larger than that in system with large gas vol-\nume, and the maximum temperature of MnCl\n2 in sys-\ntem with small gas volume is higher, as shown in Fig-\nure 10. Therefore, the gas volume can have the adjust-\ning effect for system performance improvement.\nConclusions\nA new procedure to fabricate the reactive block\ncomposed of the expanded graphite and reactive salt\nis proposed and tested. The suitable expansion condi-\ntion for the expanded graphite is found to be as 700 °C\nfor 15 min. The reactive block is fabricated by impreg-\nnation of the salt into the expanded graphite matrix\nwith no need of vacuum drying. And the test results\nshow that the reactive salt distributes uniformly in the\nexpanded graphite which is in favor of the reaction.\nThe system performance of the single-stage heat\ntransformer with the composite reactive blocks is simu-\nlated by putting the emphasis on the influence of the\ngas volume. It is found that the reacting rates of two\ncomposite reactive blocks match in the case of small\ngas volume, which leads to the higher temperature of\nMnCl\n2 and rather constant system pressure during sys-\ntem operation. The system cycle in the case of small\ngas volume is longer; while the system COP is larger.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research is jointly supported by Shanghai Pujiang Pro-\ngram (06PJ14061) and Shanghai Municipal Science and Technol-\nogy Committee (06SR07106).\nNomenclature\nA = heat transfer area [m 2]\na = constant [1/s]\nb = constant\nCp = heat capacity [J/g/K]\nH = enthalpy change of the reaction [J/mol]\nm = mass of the salt [g]\nN = molar amount of the salt [mol]\nn = gas amount [mol]\nP = system pressure [MPa]\nPeq = equilibrium pressure [MPa]\nQ = heat added to and exported out of system [J]\nR = gas constant\nS = entropy change of the reaction [J/mol/K]\nSBET = specific pore surface area by BET [m 2/g]\nTc = constraint temperature [ °C]\nTg = temperature of gas [ °C]\nTs = temperature in the reactor [ °C]\nt = time [s]\nU = heat transfer coefficient [W/m 2/K]\nV = gas volume [m 3]\nVT = specific pore volume [cm 3/g]\nx = reaction degree\nLiterature Cited\nGoetz, V ., B.
