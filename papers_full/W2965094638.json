  "abstract": "In the present study, the seismic vulnerability of a hybrid mold transformer was investigated using a dynamic analytical approach incorporating the experimental results of shaking table tests. The analytical model consisted of linear springs and plastic beam elements, and it has six degrees of freedom simulating the hybrid mold transformer. The dynamic characteristics of the analytical model were determined based on the shaking table tests. The reliability of the analytical model was verified by comparing the test results and analytical results. In order to assess the seismic vulnerability, three critical damage states observed during the shaking table tests were investigated by incorporating the three performance levels specified in ASCE 41-17. Comprehensive dynamic analyses were performed with a set of twenty earthquakes in consideration of the variation of the uncertain parameters (such as the effective stiffness and coil mass) of the mold transformer. Based on the analytical results, fragility curves were established to predict the specified exceedance probability of the mold transformer according to the performance levels.",
