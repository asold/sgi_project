  "abstract": "Transformers are designed so as to minimize weight and cost based on three presumptions: the power supply is with a sine wave, the frequency is fixed, and the voltage not to exceed a prescribed maximum limit.Fastidious approach in designing the transformer based on these assumptions is not entailed, then again proper consideration is required if the assumptions are amended.Given this as beginning, an efficient and cost-effective design has to be resolved.In order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas and replace the limited energy sources like coal or oil, the number of renewable energy sources is constantly growing.All these points led to have a best solution which was the reason for evolution of Solid State Transformer.This paper presents the constructional details of a 100 VA, 100 Hz and 200 VA, 50 Hz transformer and compares the results to claim the best design.",
