INTRODUCTION\nThe oil-paper insulation system in power transformers oper-\nates under the effects of high temperature and strong electro-\nmagnetic environment, and the insulation medium can slowly\ndecompose into a number of small molecules. The decom-\nposition gases dissolved in oil are H 2, CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4,\nC2H2, CO 2, CO and N 2. However, when a fault occurs, the\ninsulation breaks down more quickly and the decomposition\nproducts will be different according to the type and severity\nof the fault [1], [2]. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is widely\nused to detect incipient faults in oil-pregnant transformers.\nThis technique involves several steps, such as taking oil\nsamples from a transformer, removing dissolved gases from\noil, determining gas component content, and identifying fault\ntypes [3]. Fault identiﬁcation is a decisive step in the internal\nfault state determination of the transformer in DGA analysis.\nVarious computational and graphical methods employing\ngas ratios and proportions of gases dissolved in oil deter-\nmined by gas chromatography have been worked out for\nrecognizing the characteristic patterns of the dissolved gases\nthat are associated with the main types of faults [4], [5].\nThese methods available to interpreted DGA data include\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Chuan Li.\nKey Gas Method, Doernenburg Ratio Method, Rogers Ratio\nMethod, IEC Ratio Method and Duval Triangle Method, and\nthey have been developed and validated using large sets of\ndata for equipment in service. In these methods, the multiple\nnumeric thresholds and gas boundaries are commonly set to\nclassify features of the dissolved gas data. However, these\nthresholds and boundaries do not physically exist, and the\ngas data near the ratio boundaries are prone to misinterpre-\ntation. Moreover, these methods are often unable to diagnose\ncomplex faults when both thermal faults and discharge faults\noccur simultaneously. And at this case, if the overheat fault\nis more serious, it is easy to be diagnosed as an overheat\nfault, and vice versa. Therefore, the fault diagnosis accu-\nracy rate of these methods is relatively low [4], [6]. Some\nintelligent approaches are also available for fault diagnosis\nof large oil-immersed power transformers [7], [8], such as\nfuzzy logic [9], [10], support vector machine [11], [12],\nartiﬁcial neural network [13], genetic programming [14],\nrough set theory [15], deep belief network [16], etc. and\ngood results have been claimed for those approaches. How-\never, these methods are usually complicated, and their results\ndepend on training data, so the research work documented\nin these publications become difﬁcult to reproduce for the\nlack of publicly available DGA data. Therefore, intelligent\nmethods do not implemented practically on a wide range as\nVOLUME 7, 2019\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Liet al.: Fault Diagnosis of Power Transformers With Membership Degree\nconventional ones. Exploring new DGA data interpretation\nmethods is still of practical signiﬁcance.\nFuzzy clustering techniques are integral components of\nartiﬁcial intelligence, being unsupervised classiﬁcation algo-\nrithms with a wide range of applications in areas such as\ndata mining and pattern recognition. Based on clustering\ntechniques, this article proposes a new method for the inter-\npretation of DGA data. A reference fault set is provided,\nand then the interpretation is implemented by calculating\nthe membership of the DGA data to the fault set. Examples\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the present\nmethod, and it has a good application prospect in engineer-\ning practice. This paper is organized as follows: clustering\ntechniques and reference fault sets are provided in Section 2.\nSection 3 describes an application example of the method.\nThen, Section 4 reports a detailed veriﬁcation of the effec-\ntiveness of the proposed method by comparison with other\nconventional ones. At last, Section 5 makes a conclusion of\nthe full paper.\nII. THE REFERENCE FAULT SET OBTAINED\nWITH CLUSTERING\nFuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) is a renowned machine\nlearning algorithm of unsuper-vised classiﬁcation. The prim-\nitive principle of the clustering algorithms is that ‘‘birds of a\nfeather ﬂock together’’ and it classiﬁes data according to their\nsimilarity. Based on the fuzzy set theory, FCM transforms\nthe classiﬁcation problem into a mathematical optimization\nproblem with constraints. It accomplishes the fuzzy partition-\ning and classifying of the dataset by seeking the minimum\nvalue of the objective function. However, the similarities of\nthe samples are measured by the reciprocal of the squared\nvector norm in the conventional FCM algorithm, and many\nlocal minima exist in the membership function, resulting\nin the complexity of the clustering spatial structure. The\niterative solution of the optimization problem is essentially\nthe ‘‘mountain climbing’’ method of the local search. In that\napproach, it is easy to fall into the local extreme points\nowing to the sensitivity of the initial value. Different clus-\ntering results will be obtained for different iteration starting\npoints of the same dataset, which seriously affects the clus-\ntering accuracy. It is difﬁcult to obtain data classiﬁcation that\nconforms to engineering practice with conventional FCM.\nIn our previous work [17], the inﬂuence of monotonicity of\nthe membership function on clustering analysis is examined.\nAccordingly, an improved membership function for FCM is\nconstructed. This new membership function has an exponen-\ntial format, eliminates the local extremes, and has excellent\nmonotonicity, which optimizes the clustering spatial struc-\nture. Thus, the sensitivity of conventional FCM to initial\nvalue are relieved, which are essential factors for its practical\napplication. The clustering method is as follows [17].\nThe Fuzzy clustering algorithm partitions a collection of\nN vectors X ={x1,x2,··· ,xN }into c fuzzy groups, such\nthat the weighted within-groups sum of the error objective\nfunction is minimized. N is the total number of data in X.\nThe i-th sample in X is a p-dimensional vector with p features\nor attributes, and xi ={xi1,xi2,··· ,xip}. X contains a total\nof c classes. The cluster center of the j-th cluster is vj =\n{vj1,vj2,··· ,vjp}. The membership of the i-th data in the\nj-th cluster is uij. The objective function for Fuzzy clustering\nis deﬁned as:\nF =J(U,V ) =\nN∑\ni=1\nc∑\nj=1\num\nij e−γd2\nij (1)\nwhere U ={uij}denotes the membership matrix, V ={vj}\nis the cluster center set, and dij denotes the distance between\nxi and vj.\nSolve min J(U,V ) by the Lagrange multiplier and differ-\nentiating J(U,V ) to vj (for ﬁxed uij) and uij (for ﬁxed vj),\nrespectively. The necessary condition for min J(U,V ) to\nreach its minimum is:\nuij = pij\nc∑\nk=1\npik\n=\np∏\nh=1\ne−γ(xih−vjh)2\nc∑\nk=1\np∏\nh=1\ne−γ(xih−vkh)2\n(2)\nvj =\nN∑\ni=1\num\nij xi\nN∑\ni=1\num\nij\n(3)\nThe iterative process is repeating (2) and (3) until a pre-\nspeciﬁed level of accuracy is obtained.\nIn this paper, the clustering method is used to classify a\nDGA dataset X = {x1,··· ,x60}with known fault types,\nand the reference (standard) fault set is obtained. The fault\ndiagnosis is implemented by calculating the membership of\nthe DGA data to the reference fault set.\nMore than 2,000 DGA data were collected from a large\nnumber of publicly published literatures, and screened out\n60 of them as DGA dataset X. The screening process is as\nfollows.\n(1) Classify data by fault types, namely, low-, middle-,\nand high-temperature faults, and partial, spark, and arc dis-\ncharges. Each data has ﬁve attributes: the H 2, CH 4, C 2H6,\nC2H4, and C 2H2 content (unit: µL/L).\n(2) Initialize DGA dataset X by calculating the proportion\nof gases related to the various faults. The H 2 content in\nthe DGA is usually large. During the initialization process,\nthe percentage of H 2 to H 2 and hydrocarbons, and the per-\ncentage of each hydrocarbon to the total hydrocarbons, are\ncalculated.\n(3) The mean and standard deviation of each attribute of\nthe DGA data for each fault type are obtained; Data that\ndiffer from the mean by more than two standard deviations\nare eliminated. This elimination applies to ﬁve attributes of\nthe DGA data.\n(4) After multiple rounds of screening, 60 DGA data are\nﬁnally left as dataset X for cluster analysis. The dataset con-\ntains six classes of 10 instances each, where each class refers\nto a type of transformer fault, as is shown in APPENDIX.\n28792 VOLUME 7, 2019\nE. Liet al.: Fault Diagnosis of Power Transformers With Membership Degree\nClassify the DGA dataset X ={x1,··· ,x60}with fuzzy\nclustering algorithm, and the parameters in (2) and (3) are\nγ =10, m =2, where γ is a constructed shape parameter\nand set by exploring and testing, and m is the fuzzy weighting\nexponent for FCM algorithm and set to 2 as in most liter-\natures. The convergence accuracy is set to 10 −5, where the\nconvergence of each cluster is deﬁned by the difference in\nthe center of each cluster for two consecutive iterations.\nA large number of clustering of these 60 DGA data were\nperformed with different random initial values. Six fault\nclassiﬁcation patterns were obtained, and ﬁve of them are\nconsidered as invalid as their cluster centers coincide or\ntwo types of faults are statistically assigned to the same\ndata set. One classiﬁcation pattern is considered valid, with\nthe subsets and fault types must form a bijective mapping\nfor the classiﬁcation process, and the cluster centers V =\n{v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6}of this valid classiﬁcation pattern is\nconsidered as the reference fault (standard fault) data set,\nas is shown in Table 1. In the table, corresponding to the\ninitialization process, H 2 is the percentage of H 2 to H 2 and\ntotal hydrocarbons, and hydrocarbons are the percentage of\neach hydrocarbon to the total hydrocarbons.\nTABLE 1. The reference fault set.\nAs shown above, Table 1 is obtained from a large amount\nof DGA data by screening and clustering, and they are typical\nchromatographic data for these six faults, namely, the pro-\nportion of dissolved gases for each standard fault. Taking the\narc discharge fault as an example, its typical fault chromato-\ngraphic data is:\nv6 =(0.4697, 0.2530, 0.0450, 0.3206, 0.3814)\nAnd the proportion of gases in the arc fault are: the per-\ncentage of H 2 to H 2 and total hydrocarbons is 46.97%, and\nthe percentage of each hydrocarbon in total hydrocarbons is\n25.30%, 4.50%, 32.06% and 38.14% respectively.\nIII. DIAGNOSTIC STEPS AND AN APPLICATION\nEXAMPLE OF THIS METHOD\nInterpret the DGA data to be diagnosed by calculating its\nmembership to the reference faults in Table 2 with (2), and the\nmembership is the extent to which the data belongs to each\nfaults. For clarity, the calculation is split into the following\nsteps:\nStep 1:Initialize DGA data by calculating the proportion of\ngases, the percentage of H 2 to H2 and hydrocarbons, and the\nTABLE 2. The gas distance between DGA data and reference fault set.\nTABLE 3. The sub-similarity between DGA data and reference fault set.\npercentage of each hydrocarbon to the total hydrocarbons, are\ncalculated;\nStep 2: Calculate the distance of each gas between DGA\ndata and the reference fault set in Table 1, dijh =xih −vjh;\nStep 3:Calculate the sub-similarity of each gas attribute,\npijk =e−10d2\nijk ;\nStep 4: Calculate the comprehensive similarity by multi-\nplying the ﬁve gas sub-similarities pij =\n5∏\nh=1\npijh;\nStep 5:Normalize the comprehensive similarity and obtain\nmembership uij = pij\n6∑\nk=1\npik\n.\nA spark discharge fault DGA data of IEC TC 10 databases\nin the literature [18] is as follows: H 2 =305, CH 4 =100,\nC2H6 =33, C 2H4 =161 and C 2H2 =541 in ppm. And\nthe fault is ‘ Sparking between HV braided connection and\nisolated copper tube’. Interpret this DGA data by calculating\nits membership to the reference faults in Table 2 using the\nabove ﬁve steps.\n1) Calculate the percentage concentrations of gases.\nH2 = 0.2675, CH 4 = 0.1198, C 2H6 = 0.0395,\nC2H4 = 0.1928 and C 2H2 = 0.6479, namely xi =\n(0.2675, 0.1198, 0.0395, 0.1928, 0.6479).\n2) Calculate the distance of each gas between DGA data xi\nand the reference fault set: dijh = |xih −vjh|, as is shown\nin Table 2. E.g., the difference of H 2 between this DGA\ndata and the low temperature overheating reference fault is:\n|0.2675-0.3361|= 0.0686.\n3) Calculate the sub-similarity of the k-th gas attribute:\npijh =e−10d2\nijh , as is shown in Table 3. E.g., the sub-similarity\nof H2 between this DGA data and the low temperature over-\nheating reference fault is:\ne−10×0.06862\n=0.9540.\n4) Calculate the comprehensive similarity between sam-\nple DGA data xi and cluster center vj by multiply the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 28793\nE. Liet al.: Fault Diagnosis of Power Transformers With Membership Degree\nTABLE 4. The similarity and membership between DGA data and\nreference fault set.\nsub-similarity: pij =\n5∏\nh=1\npijh, as is shown in Table 4. E.g.,\nthe comprehensive similarity between this DGA data and the\nlow temperature overheating reference fault is:\n0.9540 ×0.2289 ×0.8252 ×0.8562 ×0.0152 =0.0023.\nAlthough there are high sub-similarities of H 2, C 2H6 and\nC2H4 between this DGA data and the low temperature over-\nheating reference fault, the similarity of C 2H2 is very low,\nonly 0.0152, so the comprehensive similarity obtained after\nmultiplication is also low, only 0.0023. And all the sub-\nsimilarities between this DGA data and the spark discharge\nreference fault are fair, and the comprehensive similarity is\nalso high, i.e. 0.5316.\n5) Normalize the similarity and obtain membership degree\nof this DGA data to each fault: uij = pij\n6∑\nk=1\npik\n, as is shown\nin Table 4.\nThe results show that the fault of this DGA data is 68.95%\nspark discharge and 30.12% arc discharge. In view of the\nrelevance of the spark and arc discharge, (also known as\nlow- and high-energy discharge, respectively), the diagnosis\nresult is consistent with the actual fault ‘ Sparking between\nHV braided connection and isolated copper tube’.\nIn the traditional method, such as IEC Ratio Method and\nDuval Triangle Method, there are strict boundaries between\nfaults. But in reality, physical boundaries only exist between\nthermal fault, partial discharge fault, and discharge fault.\nAlthough the thermal faults were divided into low-, mid-,\nand high-temperature overheating with divisions of 300 ◦C\nand 700 ◦C, the differences between them are not physically\nclear, and neither is the difference between spark and arc\ndischarge (also known as low- and high-energy discharge,\nrespectively). Therefore, it is more reasonable to interpret\nDGA data with membership degree, rather than simply being\ninterpreted as a single one. In this way, the problem of mis-\njudgment near the boundaries is avoided, and the diagnosis\nof the composite fault is also expected.\nIV. COMPARISON WITH OTHER\nCONVENTIONAL METHODS\nA. SELECTION OF COMPETITOR FOR COMPARISON\nThe conventional methods available to interpreted DGA\ndata include Key Gas Method (KGM), Doernenburg Ratio\nMethod, Rogers Ratio Method, IEC Ratio Method, Duval Tri-\nangle Method and Mansour Pentagon Method, and they have\nbeen developed and validated using large sets of data for\nequipments in service. Among them, the Key Gas Method\ncharts look simple, but they are not widely accepted as reli-\nable diagnostic tools power transformers, and studies based\non an IEC data bank inspected transformers shows that only\n42% of KGM diagnoses are correct [4]. Inconsistencies and\nlow success rate for correct faults type identiﬁcation have\nalso been reported for Rogers Ratio Method [19], [20].\nFaiz and Soleimani [6] and Abu-Siada and Hmood [21]\ninvestigated the accuracy of conventional methods for trans-\nformer diagnosis based on DGA data obtained from oil sam-\nples of real transformers and the comparison results shows\nthat the David Triangle Method yields out good results among\nthese conventional techniques. Therefore, the David Trian-\ngle Method is selected as a comparison object to verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\nIEC Ratio Method has a wide range of applications world-\nwide [2], and Chinese standard regards it as the preferred\nmethod for transformer fault identiﬁcation [22]. So this\nmethod is also incorporated for comparison.\nMansour Pentagon Method is ﬁrstly introduced in [23]\nand [24] in recent years. This method was built using a\npentagon shape with its heads representing the percentage\nconcentration of each individual gas to the total combustible\ngases. Compared to the David triangle method (only CH 4,\nC2H4, and C 2H2 are considered), the Mansour Pentagon\ntakes into consideration of another two important gases,\nnamely ethane (C 2H6) and Hydrogen (H 2), and good diag-\nnosis accuracy has also been claimed. It is also incorporated\nfor comparison.\nB. THE DGA DATA SOURCES\nThe data set used in this article has four sources. One is\nthe IEC TC 10 Databases, which had been used for the\nrevision of Publication 60599 [18]. This data set contains a\ntotal of 117 ﬁled data, with the faults reliably identiﬁed by\nvisual inspection of the equipment after the fault occurred\nin service. The second source [25] of this paper including\n39 cases of faults simulated in the laboratory, 22 of which\nare thermal faults and 17 are discharge faults. Another data\nsource [22] is an appendix to the China’s power industry\nstandards DL/T722-2014, including 17 ﬁled cases. The last\ndataset [17] includes 28 ﬁeld DGA, and these data were from\nthe book—Typical Cases: Application of Grid Equipment\nStatus Detection Technology (2011-2013) [26], published by\nthe Operation and Maintenance Department of the Chinese\nState Grid Corporation, which details actual faults found after\ntransformer disassembly. These DGA data have a total of 201,\ncovering six faults classes.\nC. DIAGNOSTIC RESULT\nInterpret the above 201 DGA data with IEC Ratio Method,\nMansour Pentagon Method, David Triangle Method and the\nmethod proposed in this paper respectively, and the correct\n28794 VOLUME 7, 2019\nE.

Correct rate of each fault type for each method.\nrate of each method is shown in Table 5. The correct rate\nof each fault type for each method is shown in Table 6\nand Figure 1. PD denotes partial discharge, D1denotes\nspark discharge, D2 denotes arc discharge, T1, T2, and T3\ndenote Low-, mid-, high-temperature overheating respec-\ntively. Because data for T1 and T2 are not separated in IEC TC\n10 Databases [18], the two faults are not diagnosed separately,\nbut denote as ‘ T1 and T2’.\nThe test results show that the method in this paper has a\nhigh recognition accuracy rate for various faults, and outper-\nformed the other methods.\nD. DISCUSSION\nThe Duval Triangle Method also yields good results, but\ndata near the boundaries are prone to misjudgment. Although\nspark and arc discharge, also known as low- and high-energy\ndischarge respectively, are divided by a clear line in the Duval\nTriangle, the differences between them are not physically\nclear, and the data are overlap between the two fault type,\nFIGURE 2. The diagnosis results for spark and arc discharge data with\nDuval triangle method.\nFIGURE 3. The diagnosis results for spark and arc discharge data with\nMansour pentagon method.\nas is shown in Figure 2. Those data that exceed the boundaries\nare misjudged. Strict boundaries also exist in the Mansour\nPentagon, and overlap area is larger, so more data are mis-\ninterpreted, as is shown in Figure 3. This also holds for the\nthermal faults, whose differences are also not physically clear.\nThere is a fuzzy transitional area between fault types, and it\nis more reasonable to interpret DGA data with membership\ndegree, as is shown in the following example.\nThe method of this paper can identify the trend of fault\ndevelopment. Abnormal growth of oil chromatogram data\noccurred for a transformer in the appendix of [22], and the\nelectrical test found that the grounding current of the trans-\nformer was abnormal. Returning to the factory for inspection,\nit was found that the core screw was in contact with the iron\nyoke caused by damaged insulation. This was a thermal fault\ncaused by multi-point grounding of the core. The Oil DGA\ndata before the transformer exits the operation are shown\nin Table 7. ‘ Delt gas’ denotes the increased gas between\n2011.07.21 and 2011.07.27.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 28795\nE. Liet al.: Fault Diagnosis of Power Transformers With Membership Degree\nTABLE 7. DGA data for a thermal fault transformer.\nTABLE 8. Membership to each reference fault.\nInterpret these two DGA data with the proposed method\nof this paper, and their membership to each reference fault is\nshown in Table 8.\nThe DGA data of July 21 shows that the transformer\nfault is 32.58% Low-temperature overheating, and 32.95%\nMid-temperature overheating and 29.79% High-temperature\noverheating. After six days, more fault gases accumulated\nin the oil, and the fault characteristics became clear, and\nthe fault is interpreted as 34.72% Mid-temperature overheat-\ning and 45.76% High-temperature overheating. Diagnostic\nresult shifts from lower temperature fault toward a higher\ntemperature fault. If the effect of residual gas is excluded,\nonly the increased gas (Delt gas) is considered, then the\ninterpretation is 31.37% Mid-temperature overheating and\n59.91% High-temperature overheating. Therefore, the fault\nis between medium temperature overheating and high tem-\nperature overheating, and is more biased toward the high\ntemperature side.\nMansour Pentagon Method and David Triangle Method\nalso reveal the same fault trend in their graphs for the three\nDGA data, as is shown in Figure 4. The DGA data moving\nfrom a low temperature zone to a high temperature zone,\nand this consists with the results of the proposed method of\nthis paper. In this way, membership describes the type and\nseverity of the fault in more detail.\nIn addition, it is worth noting when using the method\nof this paper that if the degree of membership is almost\nequally divided into three types of faults, such as the case\nof July 21 above, this may be due to the fault feature being\nmasked by residual gas, and it is recommended to further test\nthe transformer and use incremental gas for analysis.\nIn normal operation, the insulating oil and organic insulat-\ning materials inside the oil-ﬁlled transformers generate gases\nunder the actions of heat and electricity. Therefore, warning\nvalues are set in practice [1], including gas content and gas\ngrowth-rate warning values. Just like the David Triangle\nMethod, IEC Ratio Method and other conventional DGA\ninterpretation method, fault diagnostics with the proposed\nmethod is enabled only when the gas properties exceed the\nwarning values and the gas content continues to increase,\nindicating that the transformer does have a fault.\nFIGURE 4. Distribution of three DGA data in (a) Duval triangle and\n(b) Mansour pentagon.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nInterpretation of Oil chromatography data is the key step\nof dissolved gas analysis in transformer. The conventional\nDGA interpretation methods are prone to misinterpreting the\ngas data near the ratio boundaries, and the fault diagnosis\naccuracy rate of these methods is relatively low. Intelligent\napproaches are also available for transformer fault diagno-\nsis, but they are usually too complicated to be implemented\npractically on a wide range. This paper proposes a new\nDGA interpretation method for oil impregnated transformers.\nA reference fault set is obtained from a large amount of\nDGA data by statistical screening and clustering, and the\ninterpretation is implemented by calculating the membership\nof the DGA data to the fault set. Test with credible DGA\ndataset (201 ﬁeld cases) shows that the correct rate of the new\nmethod is 89%, while David triangle method is 79% and IEC\nRatio method is 59%, which demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed method to the conventional ones. This method\novercomes the defect that the conventional DGA analysis\nmethod is easy to misjudgment near the boundaries, and\ncan provide detailed information on the type and severity of\n28796 VOLUME 7, 2019\nE.

Besides, this method is simple and practical, not as\ncomplicated as SVM, ANN and other intelligent algorithms,\nwhich indicates a good application prospect in engineering\npractice.\nAPPENDIX\nSee Table 9.\nREFERENCES\n[1] IEEE Guide for the Interpretation of Gases Generated in Oil-Immersed\nTransformers, IEEE Standard C57.104, New York, NY , USA, 2009.\n[2] British Standards Institute Staff.
