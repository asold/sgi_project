Introduction\nMedications can both enhance health and cause adverse events, particularly for older adults, whose \nprescription regimens increase with age and chronic health problems [1]. Nine in ten older adults \ntake at least one prescription medication and most take more than five [2]. The combination of \nhealth conditions and chemical ingredients in medications can increase older adults’ risk of adverse \nevents and need for emergency medical care [3]. Avoidable readmissions to hospitals have been \nlinked to problems with medication usage [4–6], but efforts to identify and predict which patients \nsuffer this adverse event have been mixed. Studies have explored a connection between readmissions \nand the numbers of drugs patients take (polypharmacy) [7, 8], their use of potentially inappropriate \nmedications (PIM) [9–11], and the complexities of the doses or forms of their medications (Medi-\ncation Complexity Index [MRCI]) [6, 12]. Mary Dierich theorized that limitations of these individu-\nal medication measurements might be addressed by constructing them into a combined measure-\nment, the High Risk Medication Regimen (HRMR). In an initial study of 911 elderly home health \ncare patients, HRMRs accounted for 10 percent of the variance in hospital readmissions, making \nthem more predictive than comorbidity [13].\nThe potential utility of HRMR as a clinical decision support tool to prevent avoidable readmis-\nsions – which can now result in federal Medicare penalties if hospitals report too many of them [14] \n– was tempered by the labor-intensive process in the original study for calculating the scores. \nFurther research subsequently developed an automated tool that maps medication data to RxNorm \ncoding standards and created an algorithm with the coded medication data to calculate patients’ \nHRMR scores [15]. The standardized format of the coded data addressed some of the practical chal-\nlenges of using HRMR for clinical decision support, and also made the algorithm potentially useable \nacross different electronic health record (EHR) systems and health care organizations. Automating \nthe calculation also allowed for more rapid testing of the criteria underlying this new combined \nmeasurement and the “cut points, ” which were manually selected based on the researchers’ clinical \nexpertise and literature review, that distinguish patients at high and low risk of rehospitalization. \nThis study sought to take advantage of that advancement by testing adjustments to the HRMR crite-\nria and to the cut points to determine the optimal calculation for predicting medication-related re-\nhospitalizations of elderly home health care patients.\n1.1 Objectives\nThe objective of this study was to improve the automated algorithm for predicting hospital readmis-\nsions by optimizing the underlying criteria within the algorithm and determining the optimal cut \npoints for HRMR scores. Optimizing the algorithm’s criteria is a key next step in advancing the \nHRMR concept toward clinical utility.\n2. Methods\n2.1 Data Set\nThis study used Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) and medication records for 911 \nadults from 15 Medicare-certified home health care agencies that were used in previous studies [13, \n15]. The medication records included both prescription and over-the-counter medications taken by \npatients in their homes and recorded by home care clinicians in their EHRs. Medication data in-\ncluded the medication names, doses, dose forms, frequencies and special instructions. OASIS data \nfor the patients, all of whom were at least 65 and were admitted from the hospital to the home health \ncare agencies in 2004, included demographic, environmental, support system, health and functional \nstatus, and health service utilization information [16].\nResearch Article\nCH. Olson et al.: Optimization of Decision Support Tool\nThis document was downloaded for personal use only.

The original HRMR research de-\nfined polypharmacy as nine or more medications. Scores of “0” were assigned for patients with \nfewer than 9 medications, and “1” for patients with 9 or more medications.\nScores for PIM were based on the 2003 version of the Beers’ criteria, a list of 48 drugs and 20 drug \nclasses that the elderly should avoid. In defining the Beers’ criteria, Fick et al. [17] differentiated \ndrugs by whether or not they posed risks of severe adverse outcomes, and whether they were inap-\npropriate for older adults regardless of diagnosis (PIM schedule 1) or inappropriate depending on \nthe diagnosis (PIM schedule 2). The initial HRMR research assigned weighted scores of 2.5 to medi-\ncations that were always inappropriate and carried the greatest risks, 2 for medications with lower \nrisks of severe outcomes, 1.5 for medications with the highest risks for certain diagnoses, and 1.0 for \nmedications with lower risks for certain diagnoses. (Drugs that met multiple criteria received the \nhigher score.) The medication scores were then summed to provide a total PIM risk level score for \neach patient.\nThe original HRMR research used a modified version of the Medication Regimen Complexity \nIndex developed by George et al. [18] that weighted drugs by three subscales – by the complexity of \ntheir route (MRCI Schedule A), their dosing frequency (MRCI Schedule B), and the complexity of \ntheir directions or preparation (MRCI Schedule C) – and then combined the subscale scores into a \nsummary score (\n▶ Figure 4). A summary score cut point of 20 or above was set in the original \nHRMR research as an indication of high medication regimen complexity, though it was an “arbit-\nrary” distinction due to the lack of prior research [13].\nThis method of assigning weighted scores to predictive variables is similar to what was used in \nthe development of the Charlson index of comorbidity for predicting mortality risks [19], and an-\nother recent analysis that identified factors for predicting early and preventable rehospitalizations \nafter kidney transplants [20].\n2.2.1 ROC Analysis\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used in this study to evaluate optimization of \nthe algorithm and determine optimal cut points for the HRMR components (Polypharmacy, PIM, \nand MRCI) associated with rehospitalization. The ability to identify cut points is considered an ad-\nvantage of ROC analysis [21]. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) can be interpreted in this \nstudy as the probability of correctly predicting rehospitalization, based on sensitivity and specificity. \nThe closer the AUC is to 1, the better the measure. An AUC resultabove 0.7 is considered meaning-\nful by one generic value scale [22], but studies have characterized results between 0.6 and 0.7 as \n“moderate” or “good”[23–27]. ROC curves are frequently used to assess the value of predictive \nmeasures, and have been used to optimize the analysis of patients who had poor outcomes after hos-\npitalization for inflammatory pelvic disease [28], and to create a prognostic index of patient mortal-\nity after intensive care [29].\nIn using the ROC results to select cut points for the HRMR components, the authors reviewed \ncommon mathematical approaches such as the Y ouden index [30] but opted on a customized ap-\nproach in an attempt to account for the prevalence of hospital readmissions and also the expense of \ntesting overall and of false positive results. The authors had to fundamentally decide whether to err \nin the selection of cut points on the side of sensitivity (the ability of a test to correctly identify people \nwith a medical condition) or on specificity (the ability to rule out people who don’t have a particular \ndisease or medical problem). The dilemma has been described, respectively, as whether a test should \n“rule in” patients for further consideration of a medical issue, or “rule out” their risks [31]. A “rule \nin” approach was adopted here, with the presumption that clinicians would use an HRMR screening \nto evaluate patients at risk and then conduct further clinical assessments of their needs. This favored \ncut points weighing more heavily on sensitivity, at the expense of specificity and a higher rate of false \npositive results. An initial target of 0.75 for sensitivity and 0.50 for specificity was chosen for the \nrevision of cut points for the HRMR components.\nResearch Article\nCH.

Odds ratios indicated whether the relative odds of the occurrence of rehospitaliz-\nation were different for each of the independent variables that make up PIM (disease and medi-\ncation class, and medications) and MRCI (dose form, instructions, and frequency). The intent was \nfor the relative odds of the independent variables to be applied to the HRMR algorithm to see if they \ngenerated better AUC curve results and more optimal cut points for predicting rehospitalization \nrather than the original scoring criteria.\n2.3 Data Transformations\nAdjustments to the original HRMR scoring criteria were made based on clinical observations and \nexpertise of the authors – a doctorally prepared informatician, a geriatric nurse practitioner, a nurse \nresearcher with expertise in geriatrics and home health care data, and a physician who is also a clini-\ncal pharmacist. These transformations were attempted to optimize the criteria of the algorithm and \nthe HRMR cut points, and the methodologies behind them are described below. \n2.3.1 Polypharmacy\nPRN medications (taken as needed), over-the-counter medications, and medications with limited \ndosing time such as antibiotics were included in the original HRMR research, while other more be-\nnign items such as oxygen or saline to dilute IV medications were excluded. Combination and vari-\nable dosed drugs were counted as one drug.\nBased on clinical judgment and polypharmacy criteria in other recent publications [32, 33], this \nstudy modified the polypharmacy scoring for HRMR calculations by excluding acetaminophen, vit-\namins, supplements, and PRN medications from the medication count. ROC curves were used to \ncompare the predictive strength of the original HRMR scoring with these modified scores.\n2.3.2 Potentially Inappropriate Medications\nThis analysis modified the PIM scoring criteria, based on clinical observation and a review of recent \npublications regarding adverse drug events related to certain drug classes.Two additional higher-risk \ncategories were created for selected drugs in PIM schedule 1 (those always inappropriate regardless \nof diagnosis) and assigning them greater scoring weights (\n▶ Table 1).\n• Highest (assigned weight of 10) included antispasmodics and long-acting benzodiazepines due to \nadverse central nervous system effects and dementia and increased sensitivity with age. Antispas-\nmodics also have uncertain effectiveness and are highly anticholinergic while the benzodiaze-\npines present an elevated risk of falls [34].\n• Medium (assigned weight of 5) included digoxin due to potential toxic effects and nitrofurantoin \nand thioridazine due to known risks and the availability of safer alternatives for the treatments, \nrespectively of infections and psychosis.\n• Remaining PIM schedule 1 drugs retained their assigned weights (2.5 and 2) from the original \nanalysis as did schedule 2 drugs (1.5 and 1).\nOdds ratio analysis also was applied to PIM schedules 1 and 2 using the independent variables of \nhigh-risk medications and medications with disease-specific risks in the elderly. The intent of this \nanalysis was to apply the relative odds of rehospitalization for each of the independent variables to \nthe algorithm to determine if they were stronger than the weighted scores in the original HRMR re-\nsearch.\nROC analysis then was used to see if either of the modified PIM scoring criteria – one derived \nfrom clinical judgment and literature review, the other from the OR analysis – were better at iden-\ntifying patients needing rehospitalization than the original scoring criteria.\nResearch Article\nCH. Olson et al.: Optimization of Decision Support Tool\nThis document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited.\n\n777\n© Schattauer 2014\n2.3.3 Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI)\nROC analysis then compared the predictive strength of MRCI in identifying patients who will be re-\nhospitalized against modified criteria, including MRCI schedules A, B and C individually; and \nschedules A and C together only. The latter was done to address a theory that schedule B (dosing \nfrequency) might be redundant with polypharmacy.\nIn addition, odds ratio analyses were applied to schedules A, B, and C using independent vari-\nables of dose form, frequency and special dosing instructions to understand the relative odds of re-\nhospitalization. The intent of this analysis was to apply the relative odds of rehospitalization for each \nof the independent variables to the algorithm instead of George’s original weighted scores. ROC \nanalysis was again used to test the independent variables and whether they optimized the algorithm. \n3. Results\n▶ Table 2 summarizes results of the ROC analyses.\n3.1 Polypharmacy\nRemoving vitamins and supplements from the medication counts improved the AUC slightly (0.66 \nvs. 0.68) (\n▶ Figure 1). Removing PRN medications did not improve the AUC (0.66) and removing \nacetaminophen caused the AUC to decrease (0.64). Using the criteria that produced an AUC of 0.68 \n(the analysis in which vitamins and supplements were removed), the optimal cut point remained 9. \nThis was based on a true positive rate of 0.77 and a false positive rate of 0.53.\n3.2. Potentially Inappropriate medications (PIM)\nThe original automated PIM algorithm produced an AUC curve of 0.6 (▶ Figure 2). When weights \nbased on clinical observation were applied to the algorithm, there was no improvement to the orig-\ninal HRMR weights, producing a curve of 0.59.\nWhen the odds ratio analysis was applied to each independent variable (risky medications) in \nPIM schedule 1 (\n▶ Table 3) and each independent variable (risky medications considering diag-\nnosis) in PIM schedule 2 ( ▶ Table 4), the resulting models produced confidence intervals which \ncontained one for each independent variable, meaning the model was not valid.\nTherefore, there was no support of an independent PIM effect on the odds of the outcome (rehos-\npitalization). As a result, adjusted weights based on odds ratio analysis were not applied to the algo-\nrithm to improve the AUC curve of 0.60.\n3.3 Medication Complexity Index (MRCI)\nMRCI schedules A, B, and C, when calculated separately, showed similar results (0.68, 0.68, 0.69) as \nwhen all MRCI schedules were calculated together (0.69). (\n▶ Figure 3) A cut point of 33, higher than \nthe original 20, produced a true positive rate of 0.76 and a false positive rate of 0.49 – meeting the \ngoal in the study for establishing HRMR as a rule-in test for readmission risks. When the odds ratio \nanalysis was run on each component of schedule A, B, and C, the only schedule which produced a \nstatistically valid model was C. Schedules A and B produced models in which each of the indepen-\ndent variables had confidence intervals which contained 1. Therefore, dose form and frequency were \nnot supported to have an independent effect on the relative odds of the outcome (rehospitalization). \nSchedule C’s model produced valid confidence intervals for 7 of 10 independent variables. (\n▶ Table \n5) The other three variables were removed from the model as their confidence intervals also were \nweak.\nRounding to the nearest whole number, each point estimate is identical to George’s original \nweights for the MRCI variables (\n▶ Figure 4). The only exception is the variable for “multiple units at \none time”; the odds ratio analysis gave that a greater rounded weight (2 points) than George’s orig-\ninal analysis (1 point). After rerunning the ROC curve for MRCI with these modified weights, the \nResearch Article\nCH. Olson et al.: Optimization of Decision Support Tool\nThis document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited.\n\n778\n© Schattauer 2014\nAUC remained unchanged at 0.69. Using the actual results from the Odds Ratio analysis, instead of \nrounding to match George’s methodology, produced a slightly stronger 0.7 AUC result for schedule \nC’s influence on rehospitalization risks.\n4. Discussion\nThis study determined optimal criteria for an algorithm using HRMR scores to predict elderly pa-\ntients at risk for rehospitalization, and contributed to an acceleration of research in the area of medi-\ncations and hospital readmissions. Two other studies both attributed hospital readmissions in the \nelderly to polypharmacy [7, 8] – though they used different criteria – while a third concluded that \nboth polypharmacy and PIM are “under recognized causes of readmissions to the hospital”[9]. But \nwhile the components of HRMR draw increasing research interest, there has been little follow-up to \nthe initial discovery that HRMR is uniquely associated with hospital readmission risks [13]. This \ncould owe to the fact that HRMR and the MRCI component itself are relatively new to medical re-\nsearch. PubMed shows only 33 studies referring to MRCI, with one associating it with hospital read-\nmissions in the elderly [6].\nThe ROC analysis supported that polypharmacy is a strong component of the HRMR model, and \nwas slightly more predictive of rehospitalizations when vitamins and supplements were removed \nfrom patients’ drug counts. This exclusion mimics approaches used in other studies[32] and argues \nin favor of removing vitamins and supplements from future studies linking polypharmacy to rehos-\npitalization and related outcomes. Supplements are not risk-free for seniors,[35] but they are widely \ntaken for general health.[36] Removing them might have sharpened the algorithm’s ability to ident-\nify rehospitalizations by focusing on sicker patients whose high polypharmacy counts consisted of \nmore prescription medications. The results were weakened by the removal of acetaminophen, which \nalso is taken broadly by seniors for general pain relief,[36] but has documented risks such as drug-\ninduced liver injury[37, 38] that could make it more relevant to this HRMR analysis.\nAn ancillary benefit of the study is its contribution to the global definition of polypharmacy. The \noriginal HRMR cut point for polypharmacy was 9 or more drugs, one that is commonly but not ex-\nclusively used in research, and further analysis showed a polypharmacy cut point of 9 optimized the \nalgorithm and the prediction of patients at risk for rehospitalization. This could serve as a guide for \nfuture research.\nResults for PIM schedules showed they were weaker components of the HRMR calculation in es-\ntimating patient rehospitalization risks. PIM in other studies has had a dependent relationship with \npolypharmacy, in that the more drugs elderly patients have, the more likely they are to have inappro-\npriate prescriptions in their regimens [39, 40]. Attempts to strengthen PIM by revising cut points \nwere unsuccessful in this study as the AUC curves produced were only slightly better than chance. \nWhile at least one study has associated PIM with readmissions [10], our findings agree with other \nstudies that have found PIM alone to be predictive of other problems, such as inpatient falls, but not \nrehospitalization [41]. Despite its weak relationship to rehospitalizations on its own, PIM nonethe-\nless appears an important component of the HRMR construct. Dierich’s original study found HRMR \nto be “more than the sum of its parts” and that PIM played a role in its predictive strength.The orig-\ninal MRCI scoring weights from George’s research also proved optimal, though adjustments based \non an odds ratio analysis did modestly improve the predictive strength of schedule C (drugs with \nspecial instructions). ROC results for both HRMR components approached 0.7, which is a statistical \nthreshold. This analysis also adjusted the cut point that distinguishes patients at greater risk of re-\nhospitalization to 33 for MRCI (the original cut point in the HRMR calculation was 20). This is one \nof the first attempts in research literature at establishing such a cut point for the use of MRCI in pre-\ndictive tests. \nThis study suggests a need for more targeted research on HRMR scores and whether they can \npredict adverse outcomes among the elderly in ways that other measures of medications and medi-\ncation regimens cannot.\nResearch Article\nCH.

Medical researchers have not arrived on a common definition for polyphar-\nmacy, with cut points often ranging from 2 to 9 [42], and have varied in their inclusion of over-the-\ncounter medications. This study used a PubMed literature search and clinical judgments of its au-\nthors to decide which medications and medication classes to exclude from the weighted scoring of \nboth polypharmacy and PIM in the calculations of HRMR scores. Due to the broad number of drug \ninclusion and exclusion combinations, it is possible that relevant adjustments to the weighted scores \nwere not tested and identified in this research. For continuity with Dierich’s original HRMR re-\nsearch, it was necessary to use the original 2003 Beers criteria, though a significant update was pro-\nduced in 2012 [34]. Although the two lists have “substantial agreement” [43], nineteen classes of \ndrugs were removed in the latest update – in some cases because the drugs were removed from the \nU.S. market – while other common medications such as atypical antipsychotics were added. Further \nresearch using the updated criteria and its inclusion of antipsychotics and other medications could \nalter how PIM counts contribute to research involving HRMRs and to the strength of HRMRs in \npredicting readmission risks.\n5. Conclusion\nHRMR calculations are optimized by adjusting the underlying criteria of polypharmacy to exclude \nsupplements and vitamins from the count of medications, and by increasing the MRCI cut point \nthat distinguishes patients by their medication-related risks for hospital readmissions. While mod-\nest, the changes strengthen the case for an HRMR algorithm that clinicians can use to assess elderly \npatients’ risks for avoidable readmissions.Next steps include testing the automated HRMR algorithm \nwith the prescription and OASIS data of different populations to see if can be optimized further.\nClinical Relevance Statement\nThis report is the next step in operationalizing for clinicians and researchers an automated algo-\nrithm which has proven to predict elderly home care patients at risk for unnecessary hospital read-\nmissions. \nConflict of Interest\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest in the production of this paper.\nHuman Subjects Protections\nThis study was reviewed by a university Institutional Review Board and meets the human protec-\ntions criteria set forth by the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Prin-\nciples for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\nResearch Article\nCH.
