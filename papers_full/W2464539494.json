    "abstract": "This paper describes the performance of a high voltage power supply incorporating a ceramic transformer. Since the transformer doesn’t include any magnetic material the power supply can be operated under a strong magnetic field. In the article, the efficiency of the power supply is studied against various parameters. It was found that the efficiency reaches more than 50 percent when zero-voltage switching was realized. From a 3V supply voltage, the power supply can produce 3000V at a 21 megohm load. A 5V supply voltage is enough to supply 4000V at the same load. The high voltage power supply is tested in a magnetic field of 1.5 tesla. The performance of the power supply seems almost intact in the magnetic field.",
