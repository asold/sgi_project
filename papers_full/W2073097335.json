INTRODUCTION\nT\nRANSFORMERS are generally themostexpensiveasset\nin a distribution system [1]. Their high utilization efﬁ-\nciency is important in order toreceive rational return on in-\nvestments [2]. Because of low load factor and contingency re-\nquirements, the utilization efﬁciency of transformers is ordi-\nnary. They traditionally operate at 40%–60% loading during\nnormal conditions [1].As stated in [3], approximately 25% of\ndistribution assets are used only for 440 h of peak load in the\nU.S.Moreover,owingtoloadgrowthatpeakhoursandanaging\ninfrastructure,upgradingtransformersisrequiredatsubstations.\nTheclassicalapproachofreinfor cementisexpensive[4].There-\nfore, electric utilities are in search of innovative methods to in-\ncrease asset utilization [2].\nContinuousmonitoringandloadingequipmentuptotheirdy-\nnamic thermal rating (DTR) is a method of increasing the use\nof assets [5]–[7]. Demand response (DR), a technique for de-\ncreasing load in smart grid, is another way to improve the uti-\nlization of equipment by reducing peak demand.

The combination of DR and DTR\ncan provide substantial gain in asset utilization efﬁciency.\nThe dynamic thermal ratings of transformers have been\nstudied well [8], [9]. IEEE standard [8] suggests a maximum\nhottest-spot temperature (HST) of 110\nC for continuous op-\neration and 200C for short duration during contingencies.\nThe operation above an HST of 140C is recommended only\nafter consultation with the manufacturer since it may produce\ngassinginsolid insulationandoil, leading to dielectric strength\nweakness.\nInrecentliterature,theeffectofDR hasbeeninvestigatedon\ntransformers. Most of the studies focused on the integration of\nadditional load of electrical vehicles in the network without an\nadverseinﬂuenceonthelifeoftr ansformers.Thecontrolledand\nuncontrolled electric vehicles (EVs) charging impact on a sec-\nondary distribution transformer(medium-voltage/low-voltage)\nwas assessed by several researchers [10]–[13]. In [14], the\nproblem of additional load of EV charging was solved by\nthe DR of ﬂexible household appliances. The DR was used\nto limit the demand to a certain level; however, DTR was\nnot considered. The effect of DR on the lifetime of a sec-\nondarydistributiontransformer was assessed by optimizingthe\ntransformer temperature in [15]. The thermal dynamics were\nconsidered in that study; however, the optimization objective\nof reducing the sum of HST over a day by DR is not effective\nbecause load shifting can only change the average hottest tem-\nperature if changes in ambient temperature are considerable.\nFurthermore, the utilization increase of a transformer was not\nevaluatedin[15].In[10]–[15],t ypicalU.S.secondarydistribu-\ntion transformerssupplying power to a small number of houses\nwere considered. However, this paper deals with a typical\nEuropean system consisting of large secondary distribution\ntransformers (1.6 MVA) serving a large amount of customers.\nIn this paper, we study the potential of DR in increasing\nthe utilization of transformers for a typical Finnish residential\narea. A dynamic thermal modelwas used for the prediction\nof HST and insulation aging. One year of automatic meter\nreading (AMR) hourly measuredresidential electric power\nload data and one year of ambient temperature data were inte-\ngrated into the model for realistic simulation. The transformer\nhottest-spot-limit-based optimization model was developed to\nﬁnd optimal DR activation. The impact of DR was studied for\n0885-8977 © 2014 IEEE.

This improvement in uti-\nlization is without sacriﬁcing the age of the transformers sig-\nniﬁcantly. The magnitude of the utilization beneﬁt depends on\ntheDR capability of theload.Theloading increasecanprovide\nmonetary beneﬁts by delaying the investments.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the\npreliminary basics. An algorithm comprising an optimization\nmodel is proposed in Section III. Section IV provides the de-\ntailsofthetestsystem.Casestudiesandresultsaredescribedin\nSection V. The conclusions follow in Section VI.\nII. P\nRELIMINARY BASICS\nThe transformer thermal model for calculating HST, aging\nequations, and DR basics is described in this section.\nA. Transformer HST\nThe transformer winding HST () can be estimated by (1)\n[8]. It consists of three components: 1) ambient temperature\n( ); 2) top-oil rise over ambient temperature (); and 3)\nwinding hottest-spot rise over top-oil temperature (). All\nof the temperatures are inC.\n(1)\nThe top-oil rise and HST rise are given by the following:\n(2)\n(3)\nwhere and are ultimate and initial top-oil rise\noverambienttemperature, isoiltimeconstant, and\nareultimateandinitialhottest-spotriseovertop-oiltem-\nperature, and is the winding time constant.\nThe ultimate top-oilriseandultimate hottest-spotrise canbe\ncalculated by the following formula:\n(4)\n(5)\nwhere , aretop-oilrise andhottest-spotatrated\nload; istheratioofultimatetoratedload; istheloadloss\nratio;and and arefactorsthatdependonthetypeofcooling\nof the transformer.\nB. Transformer Aging\nEquation (6) describes the formula for calculating the aging\nacceleration factor ( ) of thermally upgraded paper (refer-\nence temperature 110C) [8]. The of a transformer is an\nexponential function of winding HST ()\n(6)\nThe equivalent aging factor () for the total time period\ncan be calculated by (7) as in [8], whereis the index of time\nTABLE I\nDEMAND RESPONSE POTENTIAL OFDOMESTIC APPLIANCES.[18]–[20]\ninterval , is the total number of time intervals, and\nistheagingaccelerationfactorfor .Thetransformercontin-\nuous24-hoperationwithanHSTof110 Cyieldsanequivalent\naging factor of unity\n(7)\nThe percent loss of life (LOL) of the transformer forhours\nof operation can be calculated by (8). Normal insulation life\nof the transformer is 180000 hours (20.55 yr), with continuous\noperation at the HST of 110C[ 8 ]\nNormal insulation life (8)\nC. Demand Response\nDR refers to the “changes in electricity usage by the end-use\ncustomers from their normal consumption pattern in response\nto changes in the price of electricity over time or when system\nreliability is jeopardized” [16]. Three major strategies of DR\nare:shifting(changingtimeofuseofload),foregoing(reducing\nload without making up the load later), and onsite generation\n[16]. In this paper, load shifting is considered as the applicable\nstrategy.\nDomestic appliances can be classiﬁed into different cat-\negories: heating, ventilation,and air conditioning (HVAC),\ncold appliances (refrigerator and freezer), wet appliances\n(washing machine, clothes dryer, and dish washers), lighting,\ncooking loads, brown appliances (video and audio devices),\nand miscellaneous appliances [17]. From the DR aspect, the\nhousehold end-use appliances can be divided into two groups:\n1) ﬂexible and 2) critical. Flexible appliances can be displaced\nin time whereas critical appliances do not offer such elasticity\nin operation. We have considered HVAC, cold appliances,\nand wet appliances as ﬂexible loads. All other appliances are\nconsidered critical. The DR capability of household appliances\nis listed in Table I [18]–[20].\nThewetappliancescanprovideDRbydelayingwashanddry\noperation,modifyingcycle time,orbyusingcoldwaterinstead\nof hot water. The cold appliances offer ﬂexibility by delaying\ndefrost and ice making operation, modifying run time, reduced\nfeatureoperation,andbytemperatureshift.Airconditionersand\n204 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 30, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2015\nFig. 1.

Storage heaters offer higher ﬂexibility com-\npared to direct heaters.\nIII. PROPOSED ALGORITHM\nFig.1showstheﬂowdiagramoft healgorithmforcalculating\ntherequiredincreaseintransfo rmerutilizationwithDR-enabled\nloads. This diagram contains the following eight modules.\n• Module 1: The data related to the system are obtained in\nthis block.The data mayincludetransformerinputparam-\neters for thermal calculations, annual load proﬁle, DR ca-\npability of load, ambient temperature, and HST limit.\n• Module 2: Load multiplier is initialized here. Load mul-\ntiplier refers to the scaling of the basic load proﬁle. It is\nincremented step by step to ﬁnd loading limits.\n• Module 3: In this module, the new load proﬁle is obtained\nby multiplication of load multiplier and initial load data.\nThen,thermalandagingvaluesarecalculatedforanannual\nload proﬁle using (1)–(8).\n• Module 4: The HST of the transformer from module three\nis compared with the maximum-allowed value. If it is less\nthan a set limit, then the load multiplier is incremented.\nThis process is repeated until the HST limit is reached.\nThis module provides the value of maximum loading for\ntransformer operation within an HST limit without DR.\n• Module 5: The HST of the transformer exceeded the al-\nlowedlimitforlastloadingvaluesinModule4.Therefore,\nloadreductionisrequiredtooperatethetransformerwithin\ntemperature limits. Load onthe transformer is reduced by\nactivation of DR. In this module, the optimization model\nis used to ﬁnd the modiﬁed load proﬁle.\nThe objective is to reduce the HST to the speciﬁc value by\nusing a minimum amount of load shifting. The minimum use\nof load shifting is formulated by objective function (9), and the\nHST reduction to a certain limit is framed by constraint (10) of\nthe optimization. In order to restrict the effect of a DR activity\nto only that day, the optimization is applied over 24-h duration\nMinimize\n(9)\nwhere is the load deferred from timeto later timeand\nis the maximum time for which a load can be deferred.\nThetwosummationscovertheloadpostponedtoalllatertimes\nat each hour of the day.\nThe optimization function is subject to the following con-\nstraints:\n• The HST at any time\nshould be less than or equal\nto maximum-allowed HST ()\n(10)\nThe HST on the left-hand side in (10) is calculated by (4)\nand (5), and by using the modiﬁed load proﬁle (13).\n• The sum of load that can be deferred to a particular later\ntime ( ) is limited to the sum of available power that can\nbe deferred to that time or longer\n(11)\nwhere , ,a n d is the\navailablepowerundertheDRcontractthatcanbedeferred\nfrom time\nto . This constraint ensures that the total de-\nmand postponement at a time is less than the overall DR\ncapability of the load at that time.\n• The amount of load transfer at any time can be between\nzeroandDRcapabilityofloadat thattime.Thisconstraint\nsets the lower and upper bounds of load deferments be-\ntween two particular times\n(12)\nThe total load at timeafter DR activation ()i st h e\nsummation of available ﬂexible load (), critical load\n( ), and load that was deferred toin prior times ()\nminus load deferred to later times ()\n(13)\nThe output of the optimization is the modiﬁed load proﬁle\n(13)andDRactions( )takentoreducetheHST tothe\ndeﬁnite level.\nEquations(4)and(5)forHSTcontaintheparameters and\nwhosevaluesdependonthetypeofcoolingforthetransformer.\nThevaluesoftheseparametersarebetween0.8and1[8].Incase\nthese parameters are not unity, then the optimization problem\ncannot be solved by a usual solver, such as CPLEX.

In order to limit the\nloadduringthereverseﬂows,theoptimizationmodelwilltryto\nincrease the demand at instances of higher DG output through\nload shifting via DR.\nIV. T\nEST SYSTEM\nA typical Finnish residential area distribution network, as\nshown in the schematic of Fig. 2, is considered to be a test\nsystem[21].Aprimarysubstatio ntransformer(40MVA,110/20\nkV) supplies power to 16 secondary substation transformers\n(1.6MVA,20/0.4kV).Allofthetransformersareinstalledout-\ndoors. There are 1800 households in the system belonging to\nfour primary heating-type groups; direct electric heating (DE),\ndistrict heating (DIST), electric-storage heating (STORE), and\nground-source heat pump (GSHP).\nFig. 3. Typical annual hourly load proﬁle of household types.\nTABLE II\nDISTRIBUTION OFHOUSEHOLDS TYPES FORSECONDARY SUBSTATIONS\nTABLE III\nSECONDARY DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER PARAMETERS\nThe distinct load behavior of each type of household is\nshown in Fig. 3. All electric power consuming heating types\nhave higher consumption and follow similar trends to ambient\ntemperature in a year. Due to the charging and discharging\nbehavior of electric-storage heaters, daily peak loadings are\nvisible at certain hours of theday. Ground-source heat pumps\nshow increased consumption in the very cold hours when the\nsupportivedirectelectricheater sareswitchedon.Thesedistinct\nbehaviors have a cumulative effect on substation loading based\non their count in a substation area.\nThe number and type of households under each secondary\nsubstation transformer are listed in Table II. Based on the\nnumber of each type of household in a secondary distribution\nsubstation area, transformersare grouped into four clusters:\n1) C1; DE dominant area; 2) C2; DIST dominant area; 3) C3;\nGSHP dominant area; and 4) C4; area containing mix primary\nheating-type households. The one-year AMR hourly load data\n206 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 30, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2015\nTABLE IV\nCASE STUDY RESULTS FOR THEPRIMARY SUBSTATION TRANSFORMER\nforeachtypeofhousehold,meas uredincentralFinland,isused\nto build the load proﬁle of the transformers.\nTodeterminetheDRcapabilityoftheload,theﬁrstloadpro-\nﬁle is disaggregated to estimate end-use appliance power con-\nsumption. The load disaggregation is achieved by applying the\nconditional demand analysis technique to the one-year AMR\nmeasured data, statistical information gathered through ques-\ntionnaire [22], and weather data. Then, average DR capacity of\nthe load is determined by utilizing this information along with\nDR values of appliances from Table I.\nThe input data for thermal calculations of primary trans-\nformersaretakenfrom[23]anddataforsecondarytransformers\nare given in Table III. The quadratic optimization problem\nformulated in Section III is solved via the general algebraic\nmodelling system (GAMS) [24] environment.\nV. C\nASE STUDIES ANDRESULTS\nThe analysis is conducted for all transformers in the network\nfor the following two cases:\nCase 1) In this base case, the load is ﬁrm.\nCase 2) Functional DR is consideredin this case.\nThe maximum HST limit of 110C is considered in both\ncases. The results for four substation transformers; primary,\nSS4, SS10, and SS15 are provided in detail. These selected\ntransformers are representative of the cluster of transformers,\ngrouped based on the heating type of the load. Eight suitable\nloading scenariosare selected to elaborate the results for each\ntransformer. Scenario 1 is for the rated load, maximum DTR is\nshownbyscenario3,andscenario 2isfortheloadingcondition\nbetween scenarios 1 and 3. Scenarios 4 to7 represent the pro-\ngressive loading situation where DR is activated to limit HST.\nScenario 7 denotes maximum possible loading with available\nDR at the load. In scenario 8, the HST limit is relaxed to 115\nC to evaluate the amount of winding HST that can be reduced\nby fully using the DR capability of load beyond scenario 7.\nTable IVpresentstheresultsfortheloadingscenariosforthe\nprimary substation transformer.

In scenario 3, HST (110C) is reached for\npeak loading of 162% in Case1.DR isrequired to restrictHST\nfor loading above this level.\nTABLE V\nANNUAL LOAD TRANSFER UNDER DR IN CASE 2 FOR THEPRIMARY\nSUBSTATION TRANSFORMER\nDuringscenario4,HSTreaches115 C(Case1),whichisre-\nduced to 110C (Case 2) by optimally shifting the ﬂexible de-\nmand.Similarly,forloadingscenarios5–7 ,themaximumHST s\nare146 C,164 C,and169 C,respectively.Inallofthesesce-\nnarios, demand shifting is able to reduce HST to the set limit.\nFor loading above 198%, the optimization solution does not\nexist because available DR is not enough to decrease HST to\nthe desired value.\nIn Case 1 (without DR), the transformer can be loaded up to\n162% (scenario 3) and the corresponding average load is 60%,\ngiven that HST remains within the speciﬁed value. However,\nin Case 2 (with DR), the average load of 74% can be supplied\n(scenario# 7) by the transformer without violating the set HST\nlimit. The LOL of the transformer is also reduced in Case 2.\nHowever, the LOL is not signiﬁcant in both cases due to low\naverage load and ambient temperatures. The ambient tempera-\nture corresponding to maximum HST is around14 C.\nTableVshowstheann ualdemandshiftrequiredinobtaining\ntheresultsofCase2inTableIV.Thedemandshiftquantitiesare\nlisted for one- to ﬁve-hour delay duration and as a percentage\nof annual demand( ).

The\ndemand delay requirement is high for higher reduction in HST.\nThe maximum decrease in HST (59C) in scenario 7 is gained\nby shifting 854 MWh of load that is equal to 0.33% of annual\ndemand. In this scenario, the major portion of demand shift is\nfor one hour.\nFig.4presentsthepeak-dayprimarytransformerloadingand\nrelated temperatures of both cases for scenario 5.

The ambient temperature cor-\nresponding to maximum HST is around14 C.\nThe amount of load deferred for SS10 scenarios is given in\nTableIX.Themaximumdemanddefermentis0.009%ofyearly\ndemand (in scenario7).\nTheresultsfortheSS15(clust erC3)arepresentedinTableX.\nDRisrequiredtoincreaseloadingofmorethan139%(scenario\n3). For scenario4, HST reaches 121C (Case 1), that is, 11C\nabove the limit. DR activation reduces the HST to the required\nlevel. In scenario 7, a 77C decrease in HST is achieved. This\ndecrease isobtained by 31% reduction in peak demand. In this\nscenario, the average load is 12% higher compared to scenario\n3.ThedecreaseinmaximumHSTi nthistransformeriscompa-\nrabletot hatofSS4.ItisduetotheDRpotentialofGSHPinthis\narea. The LOL of the transformeris also reduced considerably\nin Case 2.\nThe amount of load deferred for SS15 scenarios is given in\nTable XI. The maximum demand deferment is 0.23% of yearly\ndemand (in scenario# 7). The load postponed under DR in this\ncase is less than that of SS4 and more than that of SS10.\nThesummaryofmaximumacceptableloadingofallsecondary\nsubstation transformers in the network is listed in Table XII.\n208 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 30, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2015\nTABLE VIII\nCASE STUDY RESULTS FOR THESS10 TRANSFORMER\nThese values are for both cases (with and without DR) under a\nmaximum-allowedHSTlimitof110 C.Thecorrespondingload\nshiftingrequiredforCase2isshowninFig.5wherethelinegraph\nrepresents the annual demand shift required as a percentage of\ntotalannualloadandthepercentageshareof eachdemandshift\nduration (1–5 h) is displayed by stacked columns.

However, the GSHP\ndominant area transformers (cluster C3) require less demand\ndefermentsinceonlypeakspikes eliminationisneeded.Demand\ndelay for 1 h of electric heating devices constitutes a major\nshare of DR in cluster C1 and C3 transformers (Fig. 5).\nCluster C2 transformers (of SS# 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14) sup-\nplying power to DIST dominant areas are at least beneﬁtted by\nDR. The potential forincrease of loading on these transformers\nrangesfrom15%to21%forpeakloading,andacorresponding\nincrease in average load is 4% to 5%. The beneﬁt of DR for\ncluster C4 transformers (of SS# 5 and 9), which are connected\nto areas consisting of a mix of district and electrically heated\nhomes,isbetweentwooth ertypes.Thepotentialforanincrease\nofloadingonthesetransformersisabout25%forpeakloading,\nand a corresponding increase in average load is 8%. Electric\nstorage heaters incluster C4 transformers and the absence of\nelectric heating in cluster C2 transformers are the main reason\nfor high-demand delay duration.\nThe greater beneﬁt for an electrically heated area is due to\nits higher DR potential of electric heaters, and the lack of ﬂex-\nible devices in a district heated area is the reason why it is less\nbeneﬁcial.\nFrom the results, the following inferences can be drawn:\n• The loading on the transformers can be signiﬁcantly in-\ncreased (up to 46% for peak load and 14% for average\nload).Theincreasedloading cancountertheloadgrowth;it\nmay be used to defer or avoid the investments of replace-\nment and new transformers.

It depends on the load proﬁle and DR\ncapabilityofconnectedcustomer s.Therefore,investments\nforsupportingtheDRinfrastructurewillbemostbeneﬁcial\nin electrically heated areas.\nIn the present systems, price-based DR is usually used to de-\ncreasethetotalenergycostofelectricity.Insomecases,thepeak\nload may increase if DR is optimized only for savings in the\nelectricity bill. Theproposed approach in this paper is useful\nto obtain a capacity beneﬁt through DR which is required oc-\ncasionally (only during peak days). Thus, on normal days, DR\nshould be planned to minimize energy cost whereas in peak\ndays, it should be used for capacity gain. However, further re-\nsearch is required for the optimum division of DR for its ca-\npacity and price beneﬁts.\nVI. C\nONCLUSION\nThis paper has examined the possibility of transformer uti-\nlization improvement with DR. The HST-based DR optimiza-\ntion algorithm was proposed to ﬁnd the implied impact. The\nproposed model was used to perform a detailed study on all of\nthetransformersinatypicalFinnis hresidentialareadistribution\nnetwork that supplies power to various primary heating-type\nhouseholds.Numericalresultswereobtainedfortwocases,with\nand without DR. By investigating the results, it was concluded\nthat the loading of the transformers can be increased signiﬁ-\ncantly without sacriﬁcing the life of the transformer. Further-\nmore, the results show that utilization gain is proportional to\nthe DR capability of the load.\nWith higher proliferation of residential DGs, the overloads\nmight be observed more often (at peak load and peak gen-\neration) by few secondary distribution transformers.
