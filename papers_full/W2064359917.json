The main objective of this study was to evaluate Fourier transform infrared\nspectroscopy (FTIR) as a high throughput and cost effective method for identifying biochemical changes in sputum\nas biomarkers for detection of lung cancer.\nMethods: Sputum was collected from 25 lung cancer patients in the Medlung observational study and 25 healthy\ncontrols. FTIR spectra were generated from sputum cell pellets using infrared wavenumbers within the 1800 to 950\ncm-1 “fingerprint” region.\nResults: A panel of 92 infrared wavenumbers had absorbances significantly different between cancer and normal\nsputum spectra and were associated with putative changes in protein, nucleic acid and glycogen levels in tumours.\nFive prominent significant wavenumbers at 964 cm-1, 1024 cm-1, 1411 cm-1, 1577 cm-1 and 1656 cm-1 separated\ncancer spectra from normal spectra into two distinct groups using multivariate analysis (group 1: 100% cancer\ncases; group 2: 92% normal cases). Principal components analysis revealed that these wavenumbers were also able\nto distinguish lung cancer patients who had previously been diagnosed with breast cancer. No patterns of spectra\ngroupings were associated with inflammation or other diseases of the airways.\nConclusions: Our results suggest that FTIR applied to sputum might have high sensitivity and specificity in\ndiagnosing lung cancer with potential as a non-invasive, cost-effective and high-throughput method for screening.\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00899262\nBackground\nLung cancer is the most common cancer in the world\nwhere 1.3 million deaths are recorded each year [1]. It is\nthe second most common cancer in the UK and most\ncommon cause of cancer mortality with 34,500 deaths\nper annum [2]. Survival time is also poor with over 90%\nof patients dying within five years of diagnosis. Besides\nco-morbid conditions, poor survival rates primarily\nreflect the fact that over two thirds of patients are diag-\nn o s e da tas t a g et h a ti sc u r r e n t l yn o ta m e n a b l et o\npotentially curative treatment.\nA number of reasons exist as to why so many lung\ncancers are diagnosed at late stage. The aetiology of\nlung cancer is well established with approximately 90%\nof tumours occurring in smokers [3]. Smoking is not\njust problematic in terms of the causation of lung can-\ncer as common symptoms of lung cancer such as\ncoughing, dyspnoea or haemoptysis are frequently\ncaused by smoking itself so are dismissed by long term\nsmokers as simply being a consequence of smoking.\nCurrent diagnostic methods include chest X-ray, com-\nputerized tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy but\ndespite these methods improving the ability to detect\nlung cancer they remain less effective for early stage\ndetection [4]. In reality, the detection of lung cancer at\nan early stage would require a national screening pro-\ngramme. Targets for screening would be those at high\nrisk including people over the age of 60 with a history\nof smoking, those with a previous history of cancer, and\npatients with chronic obstr uctive pulmonary disease\n(COPD). However, a screening programme would\n* Correspondence: p.d.lewis@swansea.ac.uk\n1School of Medicine, Swansea University, Swansea, SA2 8PP, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nLewis et al.

It is estimated that, although having accep-\ntable cost effectiveness, LDCT would still be an expen-\nsive screening method [6]. Furthermore, there is debate\nas to the sensitivity of LDCT for use on asymptomatic\nhigh risk cases [7] and recent findings from the DANTE\ntrial suggest that mortality reduction using LDCT as a\nscreening tool might be smaller than anticipated [8].\nMolecular markers for early detection of lung cancer\nhold much promise and possess a number of advantages\nover existing methods. Indeed, markers such as DNA\nmethylation status of certain genes can be detected in\nbiofluids such as blood and sputum from people with\nlung cancer [9] as well as broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL)\nfluid [10]. As opposed to LDCT, technologies that can\ndetect molecular biomarkers involve no radiation expo-\nsure, are relatively inexpensive and high throughput so\nsatisfying the need to have a screening process that is\ncost effective and rapid.\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a\nnon-invasive technology that can detect a change of\nfunctional group in molecules from tissue or cells. Such\nchanges can be visualized using a spectrum of wave-\nnumbers usually taken from the mid infrared range\n(4000 to 400 cm\n-1). FTIR has shown promise as a sensi-\ntive diagnostic tool to distinguish neoplastic from nor-\nmal cells in cancers such as colon [11], prostate [12],\nbreast [13], cervical [14], gastric [15], oral [16] and oeso-\nphageal [17]. In these and other studies, biochemical\nchanges are often observed between tumour and normal\ncells within a wavenumber range known as the“ finger-\nprint region” (encompassing 1800 to 950 cm\n-1).\nThere have been surprisingly few attempts to apply\nFTIR for diagnostic purposes in lung cancer tissue. This\nlikely reflects the fact that access to lung tissue is diffi-\ncult, highly invasive and most patients are diagnosed at\na late stage. The few results that have emerged though\nare encouraging where FTIR wavenumbers in the finger-\nprint region were interpreted to suggest that elevated\nglycogen levels significantly discriminate both squamous\ncell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma tumours from nor-\nmal tissue [18,19]. A related infrared technique, Raman\nspectroscopy, has also demonstrated success in distin-\nguishing lung tumour from normal bronchial tissue [20]\nand has more recently been combined with a broncho-\nscope for potentially diagnosing lung cancerex vivo [21]\nFTIR has successfully been applied for diagnostic pur-\nposes on sputum from COPD patients [22] and for bac-\nteria identification in cystic fibrosis [23]. However,\ndespite success in detecting cancerous change in cells\nfrom pleural fluid [24], to our knowledge FTIR has\nnever successfully been applied to sputum for lung can-\ncer diagnosis. The aim of our study was to identify\ninfrared wavenumbers that significantly discriminate\ncancer sputum from healthy control sputum and apply\nmultivariate analysis to determine whether samples form\nsub-groups according to variation in wavenumber signal.\nThis work lays the foundat ion for further studies to\nevaluate whether FTIR might be used as a cost effective,\nhigh throughput and non-invasive method for screening\nbiochemical changes in sputum from lung cancer cases.\nMethods\nStudy Subjects and Sputum Collection\nThis study had approval from the loco-regional ethical\ncommittee (05/WMW01/75). Spontaneous sputum was\ncollected from 25 patients (mean age 66.5 ± 9.2 years; 15\nmales, 10 females), for the majority,(23/25) it was taken\njust prior to bronchoscop y for suspected lung cancer.\nInformed consent to provide a sputum sample was\nobtained from each patient at a previous clinical appoint-\nment. Lung cancer was subsequently confirmed through\nfinal clinical diagnosis) as part of the Medlung observa-\ntional study (UKCRN ID 4682). Final histology was\nrecorded where known (19 non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC): 7 squamous cell carcinoma, 5 adenocarcinoma,\n7 unknown histological subtype, 3 small cell carcinoma; 1\nlarge cell carcinoma; 2 radiological diagnosis). The two\npatients who had a radiological diagnosis based on clini-\ncal presentation and radiological findings were too\nunwell for further investigation to determine histological\nsubtype. Tumour location was also recorded for each of\nthe 23 patients who underwent bronchoscopy: 11 normal\n(i.e. no tumour observed at bronchoscopy); 2 external\ncompression of bronchus/trachea from the tumour/\nnodes; 4 abnormal mucosa; 6 tumour seen endobronchi-\nally. Based on CT scans all patients had a centrally\nlocated tumour. In total, 12 cancer cases (48%) showed\nno evidence of a tumour at bronchoscopy although ran-\ndom bronchial washings were still taken on all. Smoking\nstatus and pack years (pky) were recorded for each\npatient: 11 current smokers (median pky = 40); 11 ex\nsmokers (median pky = 40); 3 never smokers. Sputum\nwas also collected from 25 healthy donors (mean age\n62.5 ± 11.1 years; 15 males, 10 females) consisting of staff\nmembers at Swansea University with no previous history\nof cancer or lung disease other than COPD or asthma.\nSmoking status and pack years recorded for controls\nwere: 12 current smokers (median pky = 30); 5 ex smo-\nkers (median pky = 27); 8 never smokers.\nSputum collection and processing\nAfter collection, sputum samples were kept frozen at\n-80°C. Prior to processing, sputa were defrosted at room\nLewis et al. BMC Cancer 2010, 10:640\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/10/640\nPage 2 of 10\ntemperature for 12-24 hours. Sputum cells were isolated\nby breaking down the mucus with a solution consisting\nof 2.5 g Dithiothreitol (DTT) in 31 mL Cytolyt (Fluka\nBiochemika Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH Switzerland)\nwhich digested mucus in the specimen. Samples then\nunderwent centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min and\nsupernatant poured off leaving a cell pellet. An aliquot\nof cells was taken to create a second pellet that was sub-\nsequently formalin fixed and wax embedded prior to\nsectioning and staining with haemotoxylin and eosin\n(H&E). Residual pellets were freeze-dried over night,\ndiluted in 200 μL of sterile distilled water, agitated for\n5 min and split into 20μLa l i q u o t s ,w h i c hw e r ef r o z e n\nimmediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. To\nconfirm samples were of bronchial origin, H&E stained\nsections were assessed by a consultant histopathologist\nfor presence of bronchial epithelial cells.\nFTIR\nA FTIR mid-infrared spectrometer instrument (Buker\nVERTEX 80/80 v, Ettlingen, Germany) was used to\nobtain spectra which comprised a KBr Beamsplitter, a\ndiffuse reflectance absorbance scanning accessory\nequipped with a mercury-c admium telluride (MCT)\ndetector and a sampling compartment fitted with a hori-\nzontal attenuated total reflectance (HATR) sampling\naccessory. In this study, we used the MCT detector for\nreflectance IR measurements. To reduce noise, the\nMCT detector has to be operated at liquid nitrogen\ntemperatures. Ninety-six well silicon plates (LNC Tech-\nnology Ltd., Ystrad Mynach, Hengoed, UK) were\ncleaned in warm 0.5% SDS, rinsed with dH\n2O, soaked\novernight in 5 M nitric acid, rinsed again with dH2O\nand air dried. Samples were applied randomly, in tripli-\ncate, across a plate, permitting possible variations within\nor between plates to be taken into account during analy-\nsis. Loaded sample plates were oven dried at 50°C for 30\nmin (Sanyo Gallenkamp plc., Loughborough, UK) to\nremove extraneous moisture prior to FTIR analysis. Pre-\npared plates were allowed to cool and then inserted\nonto the motorized stage of the diffuse reflectance\nabsorbance scanning accesso ry connected to the FTIR\nspectrometer. FTIR spectra were obtained in reflectance\nmode. Interference peaks in the mid-infrared region of\nspectra were collected to minimise noise from CO\n2 and\nH2O vapour. The sampling compartments and micro-\nscope stage were purged with dry CO2 free air produced\nfrom a Peak Scientific compressor (Peak Scientific Ltd.\nPaisley, UK). Data points were collected at a resolution\no f2c m\n-1 from the 4000 to 600 cm -1 wavenumber\nrange. Each spectrum represented the average of 256\nscans for improved signal to noise ratio. Sample absor-\nbance spectra were calculated from the ratio of IS/IR,\nwhere IS was the intensity of the IR beam after it has\nbeen absorbed by the sample and IR was the intensity of\nthe IR beam from the reference. The absorbance spec-\ntrum was calculated as: -log\n10(IS/IR).\nData Processing and Analysis\nAll data processing, analysis and visualization were per-\nformed using the R statistical computing environment\n[25] using in-built algorithms and code developed by\nour group. We were interested in assessing change in\nthe fingerprint spectral region so absorbance values\nbetween wavenumbers 950 and 1800 cm\n-1 (442 data\npoints) were pre-processed prior to further analysis.\nRaw spectra were were pre-processed using a simple\ntwo point linear subtraction baseline correction method.\nTwo points, 900 and 1850 cm\n-1 were selected outside\nthe wavenumber region of interest that showed no var-\niation across all samples. Spectra were then vector nor-\nmalised. Second derivative spectra were then calculated\nafter smoothing using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm with\nnine points. We applied the Shapiro-Wilk test to assess\nwhether second derivative absorbance values for each\nnumber followed a normal distribution. As no wave-\nnumber was found to be normally distributed the\nMann-Whitney U test was used to determine wavenum-\nbers that were significantly different (P = 0.05) between\ncancer and control spectra. Furthermore, due to multi-\nple testing, a wavenumber p-value was only retained as\nsignificant if it remained so after applying Holm ’s\nsequential Bonferroni correction.\nTwo different multivariate analysis approaches were\nused to determine and visualize the pattern of similari-\nties within and between cancer and normal spectra.\nHierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) dendrograms were\nproduced using the ‘hcluster ’ function in the R ‘amap’\npackage with a correlation distance matrix and\nunweighted pair-group tree building method. Principal\ncomponents analysis (PCA), via the R‘prcomp’ package,\nallowed further visualization and interpretation of spec-\ntral groupings.\nResults\nEvaluation of sputum cell pellet FTIR spectra\nFTIR was used to generate absorbance spectra in the\nfrequency region 950 to 1800 cm-1 to establish potential\nmetabolic differences in cells extracted from sputum\nbetween 25 lung cancer and 25 normal control samples.\nRepresentative spectra for cancer and control samples\nare shown in Figure 1 A-B. By repeating the procedure\nmultiple times (and on different dates) we found that\nspectra generated for each sample were highly reprodu-\ncible. Normality tests revealed that none of the indivi-\ndual wavenumber absorbance levels followed a normal\ndistribution. Thus, for each wavenumber, median(rather\nthan mean) absorbance levels were used for analysis.\nLewis et al. BMC Cancer 2010, 10:640\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/10/640\nPage 3 of 10\nFigure 1C shows median spectra for cancer and nor-\nmal sputa highlighting key regions of wavenumber\nabsorbance where differences exist between the two\ngroups. The prominent absorbance bands observed in\nboth cancer and normal spectra are characteristic of\nvibration modes assumed to represent functional\ngroups in cellular molecules including proteins, carbo-\nhydrates and nucleic acids [26,27,24]. In all spectra,\nmajor peaks were observed for absorptions in the\namide I and amide II regions at 1656 cm-1 and 1577\ncm-1 respectively. Another broad region of peaks\nassumed to be associated with proteins was seen\nbetween 1400 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1.Af o u r t hp r o m i n e n t\nset of peaks was observed in the putative glycogen and\nnucleic acid associated regions between 1000 cm-1 and\n1100 cm-1. In these latter two regions there were clear\ndifferences in peak heights between the cancer and\nnormal median spectra although potential band overlap\nmeant it was difficult to quantify the number of peaks\nor ascertain exact peak location.\nSecond order derivative spectra were generated from\nthe raw cancer and normal median data (Figure 1D).\nThis approach allowed us to resolve broad, overlapping\nbands into individual bands thus increasing the accuracy\nof analysis. By applying the Mann-Whitney U test to\neach second derivative wavenumber signal, and adjusting\neach p-value because of multiple testing, we were able\nto determine a set of 92 significant wavenumbers that\ndifferentiated cancer sputum from normal. Significant\nwavenumbers were then ranked according to p-value\nand plotted against the second derivative median spectra\nfor each group (Figure 2). This approach allowed us to\nquickly filter out significant wavenumbers which were\nactual peak centres. By analysis of the spectral alignment\nwe determined 6 highly significant wavenumbers that\ncould be associated with prominent and interpretable\nsecond derivative peaks in both groups (labelled as A-F\nin Figure 2). Table 1 summarizes each of these wave-\nnumbers along with the proposed vibrational modes and\nprimary molecular source.\nFigure 1 Raw example FTIR spectra for cancer and normal sputum. Raw example FTIR spectra between wavenumbers 950 cm-1 and 1800\ncm-1 for (A) cancer sputum and (B) normal sputum. (C) Median raw spectra for cancer and normal sputa. (D) Second derivative spectra for\ncancer and normal sputa.\nLewis et al. BMC Cancer 2010, 10:640\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/10/640\nPage 4 of 10\nThe small but significant band at 964 cm-1 in normal\nsputa shifts to the 966 cm-1 position in cancer sputa.\nThis band is thought to result from vibrational modes of\nnucleic acids [28] and symmetrical stretching of phos-\nphate monoesters of phosphorylated proteins [27]. Two\nof the most significant changes between cancer and nor-\nmal sputa were seen at peaks 1024 cm-1 and 1049 cm-1 in\nthe glycogen rich region. Absorbance levels were\nincreased at these positions in all cancer cases relative to\ncontrols. Both these wavenumbers are attributed to C-O\nstretching and C-O bending typical of glycogen [27].\nDespite removing mucus during the process of\nextracting cells from sputum we assumed that mucins\nmight still be present in each sample pellet used for\nFTIR. The presence of mucins has been shown to cause\npeaks at 1040 cm-1,1 0 7 6c m-1 and 1120 cm-1 in FTIR\nspectra due to C-O stretching [29]. It is possible that\npatients with lung cancer might simply produce more\nmucus leading to peak changes at these positions. Sig-\nnificant peaks, although less prominent, were observed\nbetween 1062 cm-1 and 1066 cm-1 (Figure 2B) but no\npeak was present at or around 1076 cm-1 or 1120 cm-1\nin any spectrum. Similarly, no peak was apparent at\n1040 cm-1 however this position lies within a broad\npeak (Figures 1C, D) with a maxima at 1049 cm-1. Thus,\nwithout further analysis, it is difficult to rule out a\nmucin related peak being present at 1040 cm-1.\nAp e a ka t1 4 1 1c m-1, associated with COO- stretch-\ning and C-H bending, was significantly increased in\ncancer spectra relative to normal. Furthermore, there\nwas a shift in peak position from 1417 cm -1 seen in\nnormal spectra. Peaks at 1577 cm -1 in the amide II\nregion and around1656 cm -1 in the amide I region\nwere both elevated in cancer spectra relative to\nTable 1 Frequency (cm-1) assignment, proposed vibrational mode and molecular source of 6 prominent significant\nwavenumbers\nPeak Peak position from second derivative (cm-1) Proposed vibrational mode Proposed primary source\nnormal cancer\nA 964 966 PO 4\n= stretch; C-C stretch Protein and nucleic acid\nB 1024 1024 C-O stretch, C-O bend Glycogen\nC 1049 1051 C-O stretch, C-O bend Glycogen\nD* 1411 1417 COO- stretch, C-H bend Protein\nE 1577 1577 Amide II, NH bend, C-N stretch, C = N imidazole ring stretching Protein and nucleic acid\nF 1656 1654 Amide I, C = O stretch Protein\nAssignments taken from references: [22,24-26].\nFigure 2 Median second derivative spectra and significant wavenumbers.

These bands characteristically reflect bending\nof N-H bonds and stretching of C-N bonds as well as\nstretching of C = O bonds [27]. In cancer spectra\nthere was also a peak shift from 1656 cm -1 to 1654\ncm-1. Interestingly, none of these peaks were signifi-\ncantly different between adenocarcinoma and squa-\nmous cell carcinoma spectra\nMultivariate analysis of sputum FTIR spectra\nThe second derivative absorbance values at 964 cm -1,\n1024 cm-1,1 4 1 1c m-1,1 5 7 7c m-1 and 1656 cm-1 were\nfurther subjected to multivariate analysis (MVA). The\n1049 cm-1peak was not considered due to the potential\nassociation with mucin presence. We used two MVA\nmethods to determine the underlying structure of how\ncancer and normal sputa samples grouped according to\ntheir spectra of significant wavenumbers. Application of\nMVA performed in this way would allow us to visualize\nthe causal effects of significant wavenumbers on the pat-\nterns of differences existing both within and between\ncancer and normal sputum groups. The first method,\nhierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) would allow visuali-\nzation of the overall grouping structure and conse-\nquently sub-groups of spectra. The second method,\nprincipal components analysis (PCA), would provide\nfurther information on how spectra group indicating\nwhich wavenumbers cause such groupings.\nThe HCA dendrogram for all 25 cancer and 25 normal\nsputum is shown in Figure 3. Two large sub-clusters are\nclearly visible in the dendrogram suggesting that these\nwavenumbers discriminate the two groups with high\naccuracy. Working from left to right, the first major sub-\ncluster contains all but two of the normal spectra. Seven-\nteen (68.0%) normal spectra grouped tightly in a smaller\nsub-cluster. Interestingly, 5 out of 6 cases grouping away\nfrom this sub-cluster recorded a cough prior to providing\na sputum sample. The second major cluster contained all\ncancer spectra as well as one normal spectrum and\nanother that is an obvious outlier within this group. This\ncancer cluster had a distinct sub-cluster containing 15\n(60.0%) cases. Interestingly, the four cases that had pre-\nviously been diagnosed with either colon or breast cancer\ngrouped outside this sub-cluster. Furthermore, the two\ncases with previous breast cancer grouped together as a\npair. No sub-clustering was evident for final histology\nand no cluster patterns emerged for smoking status in\neither the cancer or normal groups. The ‘tightness ’ of\nspectra within the main sub-clusters described indicates\na high degree of similarity across wavenumber absor-\nbance patterns within these groups.\nPCA returned three components that collectively\nexplained 96.1% of the variation within the 5 wavenum-\nbers (where each component comprised at least 5% var-\niation). The scree plot in Figure 4A shows that these\nthree components (PC1, PC2 and PC3) explained 71.9%,\n19.2% and 5.0% of the variation each. A scatterplot of\nthe correlation of spectra on PC1 and PC2 (Figure 4B)\nreveals how these components explain variation existing\nbetween cancer and normal cases. Cancer spectra had a\nhigher negative correlation on PC1 compared to normal\nspectra. An assessment of wavenumber loadings on PC1\nrevealed that this was primarily due to high negative\nand positive loadings of 1024 cm -1 and 1411 cm -1\nrespectively on PC1. With the exception of an outlier,\nall normal spectra had a negative correlation on PC2\nand this component had a high positive loading of 1656\ncm-1 and high negative loading of 1577 cm-1.T h et w o\ncases previously diagnosed with breast cancer are sepa-\nrated from all other spectra due to a high negative cor-\nrelation on PC3. Again, this can be explained by a high\nnegative loading of 1656 cm-1 on PC3.\nDiscussion\nThis study is the first (to our knowledge) to generate\nFTIR spectra from sputum and derive chemical finger-\nprints for the purpose of diagnosing lung cancer.\nWith the knowledge that FTIR yielded excellent repro-\nducibility for sample spectra , our primary objective in\nFigure 3 HCA of prominent significant wavenumbers .\nDendrogram showing general and sub-clusters of lung cancer (C)\nand normal (N) sputum spectra produced by HCA using significant\npanel of wavenumbers.

BMC Cancer 2010, 10:640\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/10/640\nPage 6 of 10\nthis study was to determine which wavenumbers were\nsignificantly different between sputum of cancer and\nnormal controls. Prominent significant wavenumbers\ncould then be used to explore the structure of patterns\nof similarities within and between both cohorts using\nMVA techniques. The data analysis strategy we\nemployed was robust and took into consideration the\ndata distribution at each wavenumber. We have found\nthat many FTIR studies apply parametric tests to wave-\nnumber data with no evidence of data distribution yet\nwe found that data at all wavenumbers in this study did\nnot follow a normal distribution. Interestingly, White-\nman et al. [22] also made the same observation in their\nstudy on FTIR spectra in sputum of COPD patients.\nThe six peaks described in Table 1 all arose due to an\nincrease in absorbance at that spectral position in cancer\nrelative to normal controlsoften with a noticeable posi-\ntion shift. A rise in absorbance at a wavenumber in one\nsample relative to another can be due to different reasons\nincluding an increase in the frequency of a bond vibra-\ntion mode [27]. It should also be noted that the non-uni-\nform distribution and degree of compaction of molecules\nwithin cells can also have a non-linear affect on absor-\nbance level as considered for chromatin within dividing\nand non-dividing cells [30] . Stronger intermolecular\ninteractions at bonds, such as C-O in carbohydrates or\nCOO- in proteins, result in higher absorbance levelsIt is\npossible that an increase in absorbance levels at 1656 cm-\n1 and 1577 cm-1 i sd u et oa ni n c r e a s ei np r o t e i nl e v e l s\nbetween cancer and normal cells in sputum [27].\nBand shifts and significant differences in absorbance\nintensity at 1024 cm -1 and 1049 cm-1 may signify an\nincrease in cancer sputum of levels in glycogen. A pre-\nvious study by [18] using FTIR suggested that a glyco-\ngen band at 1045 cm-1 was increased in lung tumours\n(squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) relative\nto normal tissue. A subsequent study using FTIR micro-\nscopy confirmed increased levels of glycogen in lung\ntumour cells [19]. FTIR showed glycogen levels were\nalso increased in lung tumour cells of pleural fluid due\nto an increase in absorbance at 1030 cm-1 in the glyco-\ngen rich region [24]. An increase or decrease in glyco-\ngen levels varies according to cancer type, for example\nlevels are higher in colon tumour tissue relative to nor-\nmal but a reduction is seen in tumours of the cervix\nand liver [18]. Indeed, the significant increase in absor-\nbance levels at 1024 cm-1 and 1049 cm-1 in lung cancer\nsputa observed in our study contrast the decreased\nlevels for these wavenumbers in tumours of the cervix\ncompared to normal tissue [27]. Importantly, if differ-\nences in absorbance at 1024 cm-1 and 1049 cm-1 wave-\nnumbers between lung cancer and normal sputa cells\nrepresent glycogen levels then our results confirm pre-\nvious studies and suggest that increased glycogen levels,\nvia detection by FTIR, could prove to be a powerful\ndiagnostic factor for lung cancer.\nThe significant band shift at 964 cm-1 has been asso-\nciated with symmetrical stretching in bonds of phos-\nphorylated proteins but has also been associated with\ncancer related structural c hange in nucleic acids [28].\nThe band increase (and shift) at 1411 cm-1 in cancer\nsputum spectra might be an indicator of a change in\nnucleic acid level [31] alternatively, this change could\nalso suggest COO- stretching and C-H bending due to\nproteins. Our results suggest that further work should\nexplore the contribution different molecules that differ-\nentiate lung cancer from normal sputum spectra so\naccurate assignments of the causation of absorbance\nchanges can be made.\nAn important consideration when generating FTIR\nspectra from biospecimens such as sputum is that cells\nwill often be derived from mixed tissue types which can\nlead to spurious results [32]. In this study, we ensured\nthat each sputum sample was assessed by a pathologist\nfor sufficient presence of bronchial epithelial cells.\nIndeed, validation of our work could involve analysis of\ncell pellets by FTIR microspectroscopy to generate spec-\ntra for pre-identified normal bronchial and tumour cells.\nUsing 5 significant wavenumbers we were able to\nvisualize the underlying structure of how all sputum\nFigure 4 PCA of prominent significant wavenumbers .P l o t s\nproduced after application of PCA to the panel of significant\nwavenumbers.

BMC Cancer 2010, 10:640\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/10/640\nPage 7 of 10\nsamples grouped according to patterns of differences in\nabsorbance levels. HCA and PCA in combination\nallowed visualization and interpretation of spectral sub-\ngroups. The observation from the HCA dendrogram\n(Figure 3) that no sub-groupings emerged due to histo-\nlogical type suggests that the 5 significant wavenumbers\nare not type specific. Perhaps a much larger set of sam-\nples of NSCLC subtypes and especially small cell carci-\nnoma cases may reveal FTIR spectral differences\naccording to tumour sub-type.\nPCA gave further insight into the causal relationship\nbetween groupings of spectra and individual significant\nwavenumbers with 3 components explaining 96.1% of the\nvariation. The first two components (PC1 and PC2) show\nthat cancer spectra clearly separate from normal spectra\naccording to the loadings on the protein, glycogen and\nDNA associated wavenumbers 1577 cm\n-1, 1024 cm-1and\n1411 cm -1 . These wavenumbers are thus important\npotential diagnostic markers for lung cancer. PC3 was\nhighly associated with the two spectra for patients who\nhad previously been diagnosed with invasive ductal carci-\nnoma of the breast. This result is interesting as both\ncases had a final histology of NSCLC yet, PCA reveals\nthat both spectra have a high similarity to each other but\nare separated from other lung cancer spectra. Although\ndata is extremely limited on e might hypothesize that\nFTIR has the potential to further discriminate metastatic\ntumours where the primary arose in the breast.\nThroughout the analysis we were mindful of con-\nfounding variables that might lead to misinterpretation\nof differences between cancer and normal sputum spec-\ntra. It is suggested that inflammation plays a key role in\nthe pathogenesis of lung cancer [33]. From the patient\nmedical histories recorded we noted conditions that\ncould contribute to inflammation in the bronchial tubes.\nFor example, a number of cancer cases had also been\ndiagnosed with COPD or asthma according to standard\ncriteria. Furthermore, the control group also included\ncases with COPD and asthma. However, an inspection\nof the grouping patterns of HCA and PCA did not\nreveal any similarities either within group or between\ngroups due to the presence of these conditions. It is\ninteresting to note however that spectra of nearly all the\nnormal cases who had presented with a cough (prior to\nsputum acquisition) were mo re dissimilar to the large\nsub-cluster of normal spectra in the HCA dendrogram.\nWe were not however able to find any association of\nwavenumbers with these few cases using PCA.\nThe spectra of cancer and COPD from sputum can be\nfurther compared in detail. Whiteman et al. [22] com-\npared the FTIR spectral profiles from sputum of 15\nCOPD patients and 15 healthy volunteers. That study\nyielded reproducible spectra from sputum with no sig-\nnificant difference between patterns in smokers and\nnon-smokers, factors that are mirrored in our study.\nThe key findings of the COPD study were that major\nspectral changes between groups were observed as peak\nshifts in the regions of 1559 cm\n-1, 1077 cm-1 and 1458\ncm-1. Thus, in sputum, the significant pattern of change\nin FTIR spectra of COPD patients is different to that\nseen in cancer patients. Whitemanet al.c o n c l u d ef r o m\ntheir study that the main contributor shaping the het-\nerogeneous FTIR spectrum in COPD patient sputa isin\nvivo airway inflammation. If this is the case then airway\ninflammation is not a major contributor to the lung\ncancer sputum spectrum strengthening the argument\nthat the molecular changes observed are cancer-specific.\nIt was also important to ensure that absorbance at key\nwavenumbers were not changed in cancer sputa simply\ndue to differing levels of mucus despite the removal\nprocess. Absorbance levels of key mucus related peaks\nat 1076 cm\n-1 and 1120 cm-1 were either very low or\nnon-existent. Absorbance levels of another mucus\nr e l a t e dp e a ka t1 0 4 0c m\n-1 were more difficult to estab-\nlish as this wavenumber was situated in the shoulder of\nthe glycogen related 1049 cm\n-1 peak. Removal of the\n1049 cm-1 wavenumber during analysis ensured that dif-\nferences between cancer and normal sputa were not\ninfluenced by presence of mucus.\nAlthough the HCA dendrogram demonstrates a clear\nseparation between the major cancer and normal clus-\nters two normal spectra did group with cancer spectra.\nThus, an important question arising from this study is:\nwhat are the potential levels of specificity and, more\nimportantly, sensitivity when using the panel of wave-\nnumbers to discriminate cancer from normal sputum?\nAn exact figure should not be estimated from just 50\ncases but the grouping patterns observed using MVA\nsuggests that sensitivity and specificity would be at least\ngreater than 80% which compares more than favourably\nwith existing methods of lung cancer detection.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, we report the preliminary application of\nFTIR to determine biochemical changes in sputum\nbetween lung cancer and normal cases. Our results sug-\ngest that FTIR applied to sputum might have a high\nsensitivity and specificity in diagnosing the disease using\na small panel of significant wavenumbers. The continu-\nous collection of sputum within the Medlung project\nwill allow us to generate predictive models for lung can-\ncer on much larger datasets. The cases used in this\nstudy were recruited mainly at bronchoscopy so tended\nto have more centrally localised tumours. Thus, we are\ncurrently investigating the ability of FTIR to detect per-\nipheral lung tumours using sputum and are encouraged\nby the fact that FTIR was able to detect cancer in 48%\nof cases where no tumour was visible during\nLewis et al. BMC Cancer 2010, 10:640\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/10/640\nPage 8 of 10\nbronchoscopy. If biochemical changes in sputum can\nalso be detected by FTIR in the early stages of lung can-\ncer, then the technology might prove to be a non-inva-\nsive, cost-effective, high-throughput method for eventual\nscreening. With this goal in mind, we are also perform-\ning a longitudinal study to determine whether the panel\nof infrared wavenumbers can also discriminate patients\ndeemed at high-risk for lung cancer.\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge the Welsh Assembly Government and Hywel Dda Health\nboard for financial support.
