  "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;High local electric field intensity in transformer windings originating from transient signals is one of the reasons for transformer failures. Due to the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grids and the increased number of transients, the likelihood of transformer catastrophic failure increases accordingly. Therefore, to ensure the reliable performance of transformers and associated power networks studying their behavior during these events is required. Accordingly, there is a need for accurate modeling of transformer windings capable of simulating electromagnetic transients. Using these models, it is possible to identify frequencies that can be dangerous to the transformer windings and to study different protection schemes. This paper aims to find an accurate analytical model of transformer winding validated by experimental measurements and to study the performance of the R-L protection device during the transient phenomena. The protection device is designed based on the winding model to introduce an impedance comparable to that of the transformer winding at critical frequencies where voltage amplification in the winding is significant. This approach ensures enhanced protection against potential transformer damage to the transformer. By using this protection scheme, the high inter-turn voltage originating from transient signals may be mitigated. At the same time, it does not affect the grid's performance during normal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;",
