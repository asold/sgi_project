  "abstract": "In the last 20 years the use of ester fluids as an&#13;\\nalternative to mineral oil for transformer insulation has been an&#13;\\nactive field of research and development. These liquids have a much&#13;\\nlower environmental impact than mineral oils, besides reducing the&#13;\\ntransformer’s fire risk. Although the use of natural and synthetic&#13;\\nesters is nowadays frequent for certain applications, as for distribution transformers in highly populated areas, railway transformers&#13;\\nor off-shore windmill transformers, the experience on large and&#13;\\nmedium sized units is still reduced. One of the critical aspects&#13;\\nthat must be assessed to use esters as dielectric fluids for large&#13;\\nsize transformers is the dielectric design of the equipment. The&#13;\\npermittivity of esters and ester-impregnated cellulose are different&#13;\\nfrom those of mineral-oil-cellulose systems, what has an impact&#13;\\non the electric field distribution in the transformer. Additionally,&#13;\\nin some cases, the dielectric strength of ester fluids differs from&#13;\\nthat of mineral oil. This paper presents a study about the dielectric&#13;\\ndesign of ester-based power transformers. The insulation system&#13;\\nof a 400/138 kV, 280 MVA transformer was modelled using a finite&#13;\\nelement tool and a comparison of the field distribution under 50 Hz&#13;\\nAC power voltage of both insulation systems is provided.",
