    "abstract": "With the increasing deployment of solar power, high photovoltaic (PV) penetration is expected to adversely impact the distribution grid. One of the challenges relates to the power flow and transfer capacity of the distribution transformers. Transformers might not have sufficient capacity to accommodate for all the downstream PV to feed back to a higher voltage level during sunny periods with low consumption. In this paper, we estimate the transformer hosting capacity considering dynamic thermal rating for residential consumption with increasing amounts of PV penetration. This paper analyzes the impact of PV integration and increased consumption on the aging of a transformer. The potential of dynamic rating to enhance transformer hosting capacity is studied under varying environmental conditions.",
