  "abstract": "Transformer models have achieved great results in the field of computer vision over the past 2 years, drawing attention from within the field of remote sensing. However, there are still relatively few studies on this model in the field of remote sensing. Which method is more suitable for remote-sensing segmentation? In particular, how do different transformer models perform in the face of high-spatial resolution and the multispectral resolution of remote-sensing images? To explore these questions, this paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of three mainstream transformer models, including the segmentation transformer (SETRnet), SwinUnet, and TransUnet, by evaluating three aspects: a visual analysis of feature-segmentation results, accuracy, and training time. The experimental results show that the transformer structure has obvious advantages for the feature-extraction ability of large-scale remote-sensing data sets and ground objects, but the segmentation performance of different transfer structures in different scales of remote-sensing data sets is also very different. SwinUnet exhibits better global semantic interaction and pixel-level segmentation prediction on the large-scale Potsdam data set, and the SwinUnet model has the highest accuracy metrics for KAPPA, MIoU, and OA in the Potsdam data set, at 76.47%, 63.62%, and 85.01%, respectively. TransUnet has better segmentation results in the small-scale Vaihingen data set, and the three accuracy metrics of KAPPA, MIoU, and OA are the highest, at 80.54%, 56.25%, and 85.55%, respectively. TransUnet is better able to handle the edges and details of feature segmentation thanks to the network structure together built by its transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Therefore, TransUnet segmentation accuracy is higher when using a small-scale Vaihingen data set. Compared with SwinUnet and TransUnet, the segmentation performance of SETRnet in different scales of remote-sensing data sets is not ideal, so SETRnet is not suitable for the research task of remote-sensing image segmentation. In addition, this paper discusses the reasons for the performance differences between transformer models and discusses the differences between transformer models and CNN. This study further promotes the application of transformer models in remote-sensing image segmentation, improves the understanding of transformer models, and helps relevant researchers to select a more appropriate transformer model or model improvement method for remote-sensing image segmentation.",
