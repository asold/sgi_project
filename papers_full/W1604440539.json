    "abstract": "This paper describes a development cycle for the engineering of large knowledge bases: A graphical tool is used for editing and the content is transformed into a logic-based representation language. This representation is used to check the consistency of the knowledge base as well as to facilitate the reviewing process. Showing the usefulness of this approach, aspects of the Digital Anatomist Foundational Model will be transformed into a Description Logics representation. We introduce a special modeling technique to account for the representation of the complex part/whole relationships in the biomedical domain.",
