At present, the commonly used Raman spectrum classification models include CNN, \nRNN, etc. The transformer has not been used for Raman spectrum identification. This paper introduces \na new method of transformer combined with Raman spectroscopy to identify deep‑sea cold seep \nmicroorganisms at the single‑cell level. We collected the Raman spectra of eight cold seep bacteria, \neach of which has at least 500 spectra for the training of transformer model. We compare the \ntransformer classification model with other deep learning classification models. The experimental \nresults show that this method can improve the accuracy of microbial classification. Our average \nisolation level accuracy is more than 97%.\nOceans occupy 70.8 percent of the earth’s surface area. Cold seep is fluids from below the seabed sedimentary \ninterface, which will overflow from the seabed in the form of leakage. The main components of these fluids are \nwater, hydrocarbons (natural gas and oil), hydrogen sulfide and fine-grained sediments. These fluids are the \nsource of various dense microbial and animal populations. Microbial populations in this unique environment \nhave been extensively studied. Numerous studies have shown that deep-sea cold seeps, which contain large \namounts of combustible ice resources, may be the third ecological environment on Earth found to carry out \nlarge-scale nitrogen fixation and provide large amounts of organic matter to deep-sea ecosystems. Therefore, it \nis very important to conduct research on deep cold seep bacteria and the identification and screening of specific \nfunctional  bacteria1. The two main types of traditional methods of bacterial detection are bacteriological diag -\nnosis and immunoserological diagnosis. Among them, bacteriological diagnosis is based on the morphology \nof bacteria (size, shape, arrangement, nucleoplasmic distribution, etc.), bacterial composition, metabolites and \nnucleic acids. The accuracy of morphological diagnosis is too low, while the study of bacterial composition and \nmetabolism is often too costly, complicated and time-consuming. Immunoserological diagnosis, on the other \nhand, requires labeling of bacteria and expensive scientific instruments. Most of these methods require bacte -\nrial culture to complete microbial identification, delaying the detection process. Therefore, a new label-free, \nculture-free, non-contact, rapid bacterial identification method at the single-cell level is currently needed for \nbacteriological  studies2–4. In recent years, Raman spectroscopy is often used in the rapid identification and analy-\nsis of microorganisms. Raman spectroscopy is an  unlabeled5–7, non-invasive,  rapid8,9 in situ cell identification \nmethod that can be used to  identify10 and  research11 microbial single-cell species. The single-cell Raman atlas of \nmicroorganisms contains a wealth of biochemical data in various physiological states.\nRaman spectroscopy can provide biochemical information of bacteria, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, \ncarbohydrates, etc. Raman spectra are equally capable of providing information about bacterial  pigments12–14. \nFor example, the Raman characteristic peaks of carotenoids, which are commonly found in microorganisms, \nare 1004, 1157, and 1520   cm−1 (C=C stretching vibration) 15. In addition, Raman spectroscopy combined with \nmachine learning, deep learning and other classification methods can reflect the differences between different \nspecies of microorganisms, thus enabling the identification of bacteria. Raman spectroscopy was able to dis-\ntinguish Gram-positive from Gram-negative bacteria, and some peaks at 540 and 1380   cm−1 were significantly \ndifferent for Gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative  bacteria16. Ho et al. successfully identified 30 \ncommon pathogens using deep learning, achieving an average separation level accuracy of over 82% and anti -\nbiotic treatment identification accuracy of 97.0 ± 0.3% on a low signal-to-noise  spectrum17.\nOPEN\n1State Key Laboratory of Applied Optics, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese \nAcademy of Sciences, Changchun 130033, People’s Republic of China. 2University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, \nBeijing 100049, People’s Republic of China. 3Institute of Deep- Sea Science and Engineering, Chinese Academy \nof Sciences, Sanya 572000, Hainan, China. 4These authors contributed equally: Bo Liu and Kunxiang Liu.  *email: \nwzhang@idsse.ac.cn; beili@ciomp.ac.cn\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |         (2023) 13:3240  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28730-w\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nCurrent Raman spectral classification algorithms are classified into two types: feature-based classifiers and \nend-to-end deep learning classifiers. Typically, feature-based approaches derive numerical characteristics from \nraw signal  data18. Partial least squares (PLS), principal component analysis (PCA), independent principal com-\nponent analysis (ICA), and wavelet analysis (W A), among others, are signal processing algorithms used for \nfeature extraction. The collected characteristics are then subjected to various classification methods based on \nmultiple regression, such as linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, random forest, and so  on19–21. \nHowever, when sample sources and spectral acquisition conditions change, the spectral response to substances \nis not completely linear, which may reduce the model’s prediction ability. Although support vector machines \n(SVM) are said to outperform most multivariate analysis  methods21, their classification accuracy will be affected \nwhen dealing with large data sets. Traditional analytical modeling methods continue to perform poorly in terms \nof fit and robustness.\nDeep learning-based classification methods have recently received a lot of attention because they perform well \nin certain classification  tasks22–25. Deep learning method has powerful learning function and can eliminate the \ninfluence of nonlinearity. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can accurately solve complex problems involv-\ning large amounts of data by simulating the structure and functions of computer biological neural  networks26. \nHowever, CNN relies heavily on the choice of kernel. It will lose some time series information. If there is no deep \nstructure, it is difficult to perceive the wide internal relationship of the signal, which may lead to a large number \nof calculations. Various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been proposed to learn the time characteristics \nof Raman  signals27. However, the RNN steps cannot be parallelized and the efficiency is low. Another problem is \nthat RNN only works on previous memory and current state. However, the Raman signal is continuous. Neither \nCNN nor RNN can well perceive the global dependence of Raman signals. In 2017, Google’s machine transla -\ntion team only adopted the attention mechanism to accomplish machine translation jobs, abandoning network \narchitectures like RNN and CNN  entirely28. Later, it was used in the field of image classification and achieved \ngood  results29–32. This method can calculate the representation of sequences with dependencies between differ-\nent locations.\nIn this study, we build a Raman spectral database containing eight species of deep-sea cold seep bacteria and \npropose a new method for classifying Raman spectra using transformer structures. To the best of our knowledge, \nthis is the first time that a transformer is used to classify Raman spectra. We use the commonly used classifica -\ntion methods and transformer structures to identify Raman spectra of deep-sea cold seep bacteria, and compare \nthe identification results of different methods. The results show that the transformer structure obtained a high \naccuracy in the task of identifying eight species of cold seep bacteria.\nMaterials and methods\nSample preparation. We selected 8 pure cultured microorganisms of different species and genera isolated \nfrom deep-sea sediments. See Table S1 for the sea area where each microorganism is located. Select a single \ncolony and transfer it to 10 ml 2216E liquid medium for activation. Inoculate into the fresh culture medium in \nthe ratio of 1:100, culture at 150 rpm in a shaking table at 10 °C for 24 h, and then take 2 ml culture medium for \ncentrifugation to collect the bacteria.\nRaman spectroscopy acquisition. In this experiment, the confocal Raman spectrometer (Hooke P300, \nHooke Instrument Co., Ltd., China) is used to collect the Raman spectrum, equipped with 532 nm solid-state \nlaser (Cobolt 08-DPL, Cobolt, Sweden) and—70 °C cooled CCD detector (PIXIS 100 B, Princeton instruments, \nUSA). The laser is a continuous wave laser with an output power of 50mW , and the spectral bandwidth (FWHM) \nof the laser is 1 MHz. The laser beam was focused by a 100× objective (LMPlan FLN 100× , Olympus, Japan). \nThe numerical aperture (NA) of the objective is 0.8, and the actual spot size after convergence by the objective \nis 406 nm.The power irradiated on each sample is 5mW and the exposure time is 5 s. The size of the bacteria \nwas around 1 μm and we measured a Raman spectrum at the middle of each bacteria. At least 500 spectra were \ncollected for each sample to limit the impact of spectral noise (Fig. 1).\nData processing. Each process from the transmitter to the receiver of the spectrometer may interfere with \nthe noise of the obtained signal, which affects the further analysis of Raman spectrum. Therefore, it is very \nnecessary to preprocess the collected spectral data. We removed cosmic rays from the spectrum, corrected the \nbaseline with the Subbackmod  function in Biodata’s toolbox, and normalized with the Mapminmax  function \n(Fig. 2)33.\nResults and discussion\nModel evaluation. In this study, we used AlexNet, ResNet models respectively to analyze and verify the \nfeasibility and accuracy of Raman spectroscopy combined with deep learning model to classify cold-seep micro-\norganisms. In order to better apply these methods to this experiment, we fine-tune the above model. For the \nabove model, we use one-dimensional convolution layers instead of two-dimensional convolution layers.\nWe used the fivefold cross-validation method, to test the classification model of classifying data capabilities, \nand minimize caused by inappropriate dataset partition problems, such as the fitting model on the training set, \nthe before-fitting results may not be a model, but because the dataset partition is not reasonable. First, we cre-\nated five data sets by dividing the data for each bacterium into five equal portions. The classification model was \ndivided into four groups for training, and one group was used as test data. In order to avoid over-fitting of the \nneural network, the four groups of data were randomly reorganized into two parts: 80% data for training and \n20% data for verification. In the process of cross-validation, the accuracy of the five optimization models was \ncompared, and the classification model with the best accuracy was selected from the five optimization models.\n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |         (2023) 13:3240  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28730-w\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nConstruction transformer network framework. Our network architecture is adapted from the \ndescription of Alexey dosovitskiy et al.34 as shown in Fig. 3a. The Raman spectrum is transmitted into the trans-\nformer model after pretreatment.。The transformer model is composed of a transformer encoder and a multi-\nlayer perceptron (MLP), which is composed of a linear layer and an active layer. Position encoding is added \nto the input embedding at the top of the encoder to maintain the sequence’s relative or absolute position. In \naddition, an extra learnable class token is fed to the transformer network that attends to all other tokens. The \ntransformer encoder consists of 12 encoder blocks stacked repeatedly. Encoder block is composed of two blocks. \nFigure 1.  Raman spectra of eight cold seep microorganisms. Each strain has at least 500 spectra. The solid line \nrepresents the average value of Raman spectrum, and the standard deviation is represented by shadow.\nFigure 2.  Examples of raw and preprocessed spectra examples.

These spectra are input into our model.\n4\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |         (2023) 13:3240  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28730-w\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nThe structure is shown in Fig. 3b. The first block is a multi-head attention  block28, which uses 12 attention heads \nand an embedding dimension of 768. The second block is a simple fully connected feedforward neural network. \nThe module framework of each fully connected feedforward neural network is shown in Fig. 3c. The two blocks \nare connected by the residual network structure. The Adam optimizer with default settings is used to train the \n model35. The cross-entropy function is used as the loss function.\nClassification results of cold seep bacteria by transformer model. We used a trained transformer \nclassification model to identify the species of each microbial cell based on the flora in the test data set. Each \nbranching group in the test dataset was predicted by the trained Transformer classification model and assigned \nto a specific category。For identifying different microbial species, our transformer classification model has an \naverage accuracy of 97.3%. As shown in Fig. 4, the classification accuracy of bacterial Microbacterium sp. AQ95 is \n100%, the recognition accuracy of Psychrobacter sp. QS172, Bacillus sp. AQ34B2C1, Pseudomonas sp. AQ238B1 \nand Halomonas sp. MT107 is higher than 97% and the identification accuracy of Sulfitobacter sp. SQ167, Rhodo-\ncoccus sp. AQ113B2C1, and Pseudoalteromonas sp. AQ256B3 is higher than 95%.\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the specificity and sensitivity of five species \nclassifications in the fivefold cross-validation study (Fig. 5). The eight strains’ mean AUC (area under the ROC \ncurve) was all greater than 0.97, indicating that our classification model had high specificity and sensitivity for \nclassifying different microbial species.\nIn comparison, we used common analytical techniques such as deep learning to predict the types of single \ncells. We applied the original spectral data to AlexNet and ResNet for prediction, with the accuracy of 96.5% and \n95.9% respectively. We plotted the confusion matrix of the above-mentioned classification model for deep-sea \nbacteria (Fig. S1, S2).\nIn conclusion, these results suggest that Raman spectroscopy combined with Transformer is a reliable method \nfor the accurate identification of different microorganisms at the single-cell level.\nConclusions\nIn this study, we analyzed eight kinds of microorganisms obtained from cold seep in different sea areas. We \ncollected their Raman spectra and combined with transformer model to classify cold seep microorganisms. In \naddition, we used fivefold cross-validation to ensure good robustness of the model. Raman spectroscopy can \nbe easily extended to new microbial applications due to its undamaging and unlabeled advantages. Meanwhile, \nthe specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of other common deep learning classification methods are compared. \nIn addition, the new method of Raman spectrum classification proposed in this paper can also be applied to \nthe accurate classification of other samples, which provides valuable insights for the accurate analysis of Raman \ndata in the future.\nFigure 3.
