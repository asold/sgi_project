  "abstract": "This research presents the evaluation of activated Bentonite material for treatment of used transformer oil. Different properties such as; electrical, physical, chemical and thermal of used transformer oil were meas-ured before and after purification and treatment. Two power transformers were used in this research (6.4: 4.6 MVA, 3 phases, 50 Hz). One of them was filled with purified oil and the other was filled with activated Bentonite treated oil after purification, and then the two power transformers were tested for one year under practical conditions of the operating field. Initial tests have indicated that the use of Activated BENTONITE in the treatment process for the aged transformer oil improved breakdown voltage, water content, total acidi-ty and flash point. Thus activated Bentonite gives an ideal treatment of aged transformer oil with its environmental and economic advantages. Moreover, activated Bentonite is available at many places in Egypt with low costs.",
