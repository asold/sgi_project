    "abstract": "The Saudi General Aptitude Test (GAT) aims to measure the analytical and inferential learning abilities of high school graduates seeking admission to higher education institutions. Given the need for effective preparation tools, this study investigates the potential of chat generative pre-trained transformers to assist students in preparing for the GAT, especially in Arabic. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering questions related to mental and logical abilities, specifically in Arabic. The performance of GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Gemini was examined through 21 experiments to determine their accuracy in answering a range of GAT-related questions. The findings indicate that although GPT-4 and GPT-4o outperformed Gemini in providing accurate answers for the GAT, their current accuracy levels still require improvement.",
