Many aspects can classify them: by their rating, man -\nufacturing technology, application, etc. [1–3]. The design \noptimization and the accurate modeling of transformers \ncan be numerically expensive and complex engineering \ntask, where many physical domains should be harmonized \nsimultaneously [4, 5]. The challenging part of the trans -\nformer optimization problem highly depends on the appli -\ncation and the applied technology. For instance, in the case \nof the modern, solid-state transformers, the determination \nof the minimal losses and optimal value of inductances \nneeds an accurate calculation of the medium, high-fre -\nquency harmonics and the caused non-linearities [6–11]. \nOr in the case of large power transformers, the thermal and \nthe electrical properties should be examined together with \nthe mechanical stresses in their windings [3, 4, 12–14].\nThe accurate calculation of these quantities needs cut -\nting edge numerical solvers, which should be validated by \nmeasurements. There are open benchmark problems pub -\nlished and maintained by the Compumag Society [15]. \nThese problems are related to simple, analytically for -\nmulated problems or measurements. These benchmarks \naim to compare some selected electromagnetic quantities \nwith these given precise measurements or analytical for -\nmulations. However, in electrical optimization tasks, the \nmachine parameters cannot be calculated directly from \nthe geometry. The paper presents a simple, small, shell-\ntype benchmark transformer manufactured by a simple \ntechnology, where the primary and secondary windings \nare wounded together. This means that the realized wind -\ning system contains randomly positioned windings. This \ncheap manufacturing technology is very generally used \nbecause it is precise enough to produce transformer wind -\nings with the given losses, where the transformer's short \ncircuit impedance is not important. It can be manufactured \nwith higher tolerances, but this is not important in many \napplications. These transformers no-load and short-cir -\ncuit performance can be modeled by the transformer's \nwell-known T-model parameters [16] and the no-load and \nshort-circuit measurements of the transformer.\nThis parameter estimation's main difficulties are that \nthe leakage impedances in the applied transformer model \nare significant, more than ten times higher than the trans -\nformer's main impedances. Moreover, these quantities are \nnot fully physically independent parameters. Therefore, \nfinding the optimal solution of the given equation system \n124|Kuczmann et al.\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci., 65(2), pp. 123–130, 2021\nis a challenging task for the state-of-the-art bio-inspired \nmetaheuristic algorithms [17]. Due to the no-free launch \ntheorem of the mathematical optimization, these different \nmeta-heuristic searches should be compared on the same \noptimization task to determine which one is the most suit -\nable for the given optimization problem [18, 19]. \nThe presented transformer parameter identification \nproblem can be used to benchmark the different optimiza -\ntion techniques on this problem and benchmark state-of-\nthe-art numerical solvers. The source code and the results \nof this simple benchmark problem can be accessible from \nĀrtap's example directory.\n2 Ārtap framework\nThe Ārtap framework [20, 21] is a MIT licensed robust \ndesign optimization tool, written in Python (Ārtap is \navailable for downloading from the web page of [22]). The \ndevelopment of the framework is motivated by an indus -\ntrial brazing process, where several multi-physical Finite \nElement Method (FEM) based solvers, Neural networks \nand Model Order Reduction tools have to be used together \nto make an optimized design of an inductor [23–26]. Ārtap \nis designed to provide a collection of numerical solvers \nand optimization tools for robust design optimization of \nelectrical machines [19, 26-29]. Ārtap provides a simpli -\nfied interface for integrated optimization and numerical \nlibraries. It has a simple, three-layered architecture (Fig. \n1), where the task of the user is to define the Problem \nclass and rewrite the evaluate() function. Through the \nalgorithm class, the different optimization solvers can be \ninvoked automatically, with a single command. Moreover, \nit contains an integrated FEM - solver (Agros suite [30, \n32]) and several interfaces to commercial numerical \nlibraries (like COMSOL Multiphysics [33]) and surrogate \nmodelling tools [19-21].\nIn this paper, these optimization algorithms are used \nto analyze the performance of the different optimization \nsolvers.\n3 Transformer measurement setup\nA photo of the transformer measurement setup can be \nseen in Fig. 2, the block diagram is depicted in Fig. 3. \nMeasurements have been performed at the Laboratory of \nthe e-Mobility Competence Center of the Széchenyi István \nUniversity, Győr.\nThe nominal values of the type DB-0.25 transformer \nunder test manufactured in Hungary are known from the \nnameplate: primary voltage is 230 V, power is 250 VA.\nThe one phase transformer under test is supplied by the \nprimary voltage U1 via a toroid transformer, i.e. U1 can be \ncontrolled. The secondary coil of the transformer is loaded \nby a variable resistor with resistance RL. The primary volt-\nage U1 and current I1, furthermore the secondary voltage \nU2 and current I2 are measured by a power analyzer. Here, \nRMS-values are presented.\nThe Tektronix PA3000 is a four-channel powerful and \nversatile precision power analyzer designed to accurate \nmeasurements of electrical power. In this measurement \nsetup the RMS-value of the voltage and the current, the \nfrequency, the effective power, the reactive power, and the \nvirtual power as well as the power factor have been col -\nlected by the power analyzer.\nFig. 1 Structure of the Ārtap  framework\nKuczmann et al.\nPeriod.

From the open circuit measurement results, the \nparallel connected Rm and Xm can be obtained as:\nTable 1 Measured data\nU1 [V] 230.34 229.36 229.02 228.13 48.634\nI1 [A] 0.116 0.3485 0.57078 1.2748 1.1055\ncos ϕ 0.2136 0.9267 0.9693 0.9921 0.9922\nU2 [V] 13.026 12.414 11.951 10.95 0.0\nRL [Ω] ∞ 2.3448 1.2745 0.4992 0.0\nFig. 2 The transformer measurement setup\nFig. 3 Block diagram of the transformer measurement system\n126|Kuczmann et al.\nPeriod.

It can be supposed, that R2 = R1 and \nX2 = X1, i.e. R1 = R2 = 21.8 Ω and X1 = X2 = 2.7 Ω.\n5 Parameter identification by Ārtap\nAn objective function must be set up to solve the parame -\nter identification numerically.\nThe following objective function has been performed [33]:\nFF FF=+ +12 3 , (4)\nwhere:\nF I\nIi\nn calc\nmeas\n1 1\n1\n1\n2\n1=− \n\n\n\n\n=∑\n,\n,\n, (5)\nF i\nn calc\nmeas\n2 1\n1\n1\n2\n1=− \n\n\n\n\n=∑\ncos\ncos ,\n,\n,\nϕ\nϕ\n (6)\nF U\nUi\nn calc\nmeas\n3 1\n2\n2\n2\n1=− \n\n\n\n\n=∑\n,\n,\n.

In the last term of the objective function \nU2,calc and U2,meas  are the simulated and the measured sec -\nondary voltages.\nThe primary current can be got by:\nI U\nZe\n1\n1\n, ,calc =  (8)\nwhere U1 means the measured input voltage, and Ze is the \nequivalent input impedance,\nZR jX Rj Xa RR jXem mL=+ +× ×+ +()11\n2\n22 . (9)\nFor further use, the last term, i.e. the equivalent imped -\nance of the parallel elements is denoted by Zp. The second-\nary voltage can be derived from the voltage divider rule as:\nUU Z\nZ\naR\naR Rj X a\np\ne\nL\nL\n21\n2\n2\n22\n1\n, .calc = ++\n (10)\nThe Ārtap code is as follows. First, some packages must \nbe imported, as seen in Algorithm 1.\nNext, the problem is defined. The parameters of the \nproblem are given with their bounds, then the above \nmentioned objective function is implemented in Python. \nMeasured data set is necessary to calculate the objective \nfunction. The code segment is very easy to understand as \nit is given in Algorithm 2.\nThe next step is to run the selected algorithm with some \nparameters, like the population number or the population \nsize when applying genetic algorithms. In Algorithm 3, \nthe SMPSO technique is applied.\nOnly the second line must be changed to apply another \ngenetic algorithm based solver, e.g.:\nalgorithmN SG AIIp roblem= ()\nor\nalgorithmE psMOEA problem= () .\nAt the end, the results of optimization can be got for \nfurther use, for example to check the identified model \nbehavior.

SMPSO, NSGAII and EpsMOEA \nare genetic algorithms, giving more or less the same val -\nues. Nelder-Mead method requires to set some initial con -\nditions, and the result depends on it. For example, Nelder-\nMead (1) is with the initial conditions: [10,10,10000,1000], \nand Nelder-Mead (2) is with the initial conditions: \n[1,2,10000,1000]. The difference between initial condi -\ntions is quite small, however the results are different. The \nalgorithms CG, Powell, COBYLA and BFGS have been \nrun with the initial conditions of [1,2,10000,1000] (these \nalgorithms can be run easily by changing the algorithm \nname).
