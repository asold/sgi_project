The discussion underscores thein-\nherent complexity and specificity of operative notes, the issue of accountability, andthe potential data protection issues \nassociated with the use of AI in healthcare. Theletter emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of \nthecomplexities involved in applying AI in healthcare and calls for a more nuanced andresponsible approach to the integra-\ntion of AI in surgical documentation.\nKeywords Artificial intelligence · Surgical documentation · Operative notes · GPT-4 · Dataprotection · Healthcare \napplications\nDear Editor,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the article \n\"GPT-4 and Ophthalmology Operative Notes\" by Wais-\nberg et al. [1 ]. The authors propose the use of GPT-4, an \nadvanced large language model developed by OpenAI, to \ngenerate ophthalmic operative notes.\nWhile the potential of AI in healthcare is undeniable, \nthe application of GPT-4 in this context is problematic for \nseveral reasons. Firstly, the authors seem to overlook the \ninherent complexity and specificity of operative notes. These \nnotes are not merely generic descriptions of a surgical proce-\ndure; they are detailed accounts of a specific operation per -\nformed on a specific patient, taking into account the unique \ncharacteristics and circumstances of the case. A language \nmodel like GPT-4, no matter how advanced, cannot repli-\ncate the nuanced understanding and clinical judgment of a \nhuman surgeon.\nSecondly, the authors fail to address the issue of account-\nability. Operative notes are legal documents that carry signif-\nicant weight in the context of patient care and medico-legal \ndisputes. The responsibility for the accuracy and complete-\nness of these notes lies with the operating surgeon. Delegat-\ning this responsibility to an AI model raises serious ethical \nand legal questions.\nThirdly, the authors' assertion that GPT-4 can generate a \n\"detailed note, with all the required components of a good \nophthalmic note\" is misleading. The example provided in \nthe article is a generic description of a cataract surgery, \nlacking the specific details that would be expected in a real \noperative note. Furthermore, the authors do not provide any \nevidence of GPT-4's ability to accurately capture the unique \naspects of individual cases, such as intraoperative complica-\ntions or deviations from the standard procedure. Lastly, the \nauthors' claim that GPT-4 can \"drastically improve the time-\nconsuming process of writing ophthalmic surgical notes\" is \nunsubstantiated. While AI can certainly assist in automating \ncertain tasks, the writing of operative notes requires a level \nof clinical understanding and decision-making that cannot \nbe automated. The time saved by using GPT-4 to generate \na generic operative note would likely be offset by the time \nrequired for the surgeon to review and correct the note.\nMoreover, the application of AI in healthcare raises sig-\nnificant data protection issues that the authors fail to address. \nOperative notes contain sensitive patient information, and \nAssociate Editor Stefan M. Duma  oversaw the review of this \narticle.\n * Aaron Lawson McLean \n aaron.lawsonmclean@med.uni-jena.de\n1 Department of Neurosurgery, Jena University Hospital \n– Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Am Klinikum 1, \n07747 Jena, Germany\n2642 A. Lawson McLean \n1 3\nthe use of AI models like GPT-4 in processing this data \nposes potential risks to patient privacy. The authors do not \ndiscuss how these risks would be mitigated, nor do they con-\nsider the implications of data protection regulations such as \nthe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU. \nThis oversight highlights the need for a more comprehensive \nexploration of the complexities involved in applying AI in \nhealthcare.\nIn conclusion, while the application of AI in healthcare \nholds great promise, it is essential to approach this field with \na clear understanding of the limitations of AI and the unique \ncomplexities of medical practice. The use of GPT-4 to gen-\nerate surgical operative notes, as proposed by Waisberg \net al., is in my view a misguided approach that overlooks \nthese crucial considerations.\nSincerely,\nAaron Lawson McLean\nFunding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt \nDEAL.
