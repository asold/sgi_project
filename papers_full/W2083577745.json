Because of this, cognitive processes may\ndiffer qualitatively and quantitatively across species.\nOne important tool of comparative cognition is to analyze the\nperformance of different species facing the same task. However, if\ntwo species are to be compared on the basis of their final\nperformance on a single task then task-specific factors may lead to\ndifferences that are not indicative of general problem-solving\nability but are instead expressing different motivational predispo-\nsitions or other non-cognitive specialisations.\nA well-argued response to this problem is using a battery of\ndifferent tasks rather than a single one [2–6]. It is also essential to\nuse a sufficiently diverse set of tasks. For instance, comparing tool-\nusing and non-tool using species only in tool-using tasks and\nreaching conclusions in terms of problem-solving ability would\nmake little sense, as would using only tasks that favour proactive\nrather than passive solutions.\nWe then start from the premise that focusing on species-specific\nmechanisms and on the strategies that underlie problem-solving\nperformance in a diversity of contexts is more informative than\nattempts to rank individuals or species on problem-solving success\nwithout due reflection on the cognitive demands of the tasks\nemployed. This logic could be followed by offering several tasks\nsimultaneously and by successively removing the options that have\nalready been mastered. A survey of discrepancies between species\nof which tasks are approached first, how many solutions are\ndiscovered, how quickly the species re-learn, overcome habits and\nadapt to changes by switching between different solutions, may\nexpose factors influencing species-specific traits such as behav-\nioural flexibility, neophilia, exploration strategy, attention, moti-\nvation, affordance learning, anatomical constraints and other traits\nof interest. Apparatuses offering different physical problems at the\nsame time have been used in various experiments targeting intra-\nspecific social learning (rather than technical competence) eg. [7–\n10], but to our knowledge, have not been used for inter-specific\ncomparisons of the mechanisms underlying problem solving.\nWe applied this approach to two highly competent extractive\nforagers: a parrot (the kea, Nestor notabilis) and a corvid (the New\nCaledonian crow, Corvus moneduloides ). These birds are both\nrepresentatives of two avian families that stand out for having larger\nencephalization quotients [11–13] and greater innovation scores\n[14–16] than other avian taxa, and that seem to parallel the great\napes in performance in some physical tasks [17–26]. Kea are\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20231\nneophilic mountain parrots of New Zealand with well-known\nmanipulative skills that are not known to use tools in the wild, while\nNew Caledonian crows are known for their tool manufacture and\nuse in the wild [27–29]. Both species are renowned for their problem\nsolving skills in various physical cognition tasks [8,17,18,20,23–\n26;30–32]. Both species are generalists that live in social groups and\nwithin complex environments with fluctuating resources and pursue\na food extracting foraging style, kea digging for roots in the ground of\nmountain plains and crows fishing for larvae in decaying tree logs\n[27,29,33]. Our captive kea had also shown competence in the use of\ncompact objects, such as wooden blocks, as tools to access rewards\n[18,30]. This gives us an opportunity to disentangle various possible\ncognitive and non-cognitive factors influencing differential perfor-\nmance in problem solving in a natural tool user as well as a naturally\nnon-tool using species.\nOne of the issues that motivate our study concerns the evolution\nof tool use and its cognitive underpinnings, in particular whether\nthere is something special about the cognition associated with tool\nuse and other forms of complex object manipulation. For example,\nit is possible that adaptive specialization to a given type of tool use\nmay either enhance or impair performance in other tool-related or\nobject-manipulation tasks. It has been argued, that while tool-\nrelated behavior may not necessarily be more cognitively\ndemanding than other forms of problem-solving, it may be more\nrevealing of the information-processing that it involves, and hence\nmay be useful to expose what animals understand about the\nrelationship between objects and the effects objects have on one\nanother [33]. So far researchers have attempted to experimentally\ndetermine the role of factors such as pre-functional development\n[28,34] (associative) experience, affordance learning [24], self-\ncontrol, planning and reasoning about invisible forces [35]. Here\nwe focus on how the specificity of tasks determines differential\nperformance in a comparative setting.\nWe developed a ‘‘Multi Access Box’’ (MAB), as a tool to\ncompare problem solving in extractive foraging species. The MAB\nfeatures a battery of tasks that all lead to the same goal, a food\nreward presented in the centre of a transparent box. Initially the\nsubject is allowed to choose any of the four options, but once a\nsubject has developed a consistently successful performance with\neach technique to access the food, this solution is blocked and we\nrecord its performance in establishing competence in an\nalternative strategy. Six kea and five crows were exposed to this\nsetup, where two of the tasks required the use of a mediating object\nas a tool (either a stick or a ball). The other two solutions did not\nrequire tool use and involved either pulling a string tied around the\nreward or pulling from a hook handle to open a window.\nResults\nFirst Session\nThere were differences in the way kea and crows behaved\ntowards the apparatus (see apparatus in Figure 1), and this\ntranslated in differences in the number of solutions discovered\n(namely used successfully at least once) within the first session.\nAveraging across individuals, NCCs found 0.75 (Range 0–1) and\nkea 2.33 (Range 2–3) solutions within the first session (see Figure 2).\nAlso within the first session, all kea touched (i.e. made physical\ncontact with) all four opening devices and both tool types, while\nthe NCCs rarely touched the apparatus (except the string). The\ncrow Annie-Claude was excluded from testing after failing to\nretrieve the food reward within the time given during the\nhabituation phase.\nFigure 1.

Entrance manipulations by the crows\nconsisted almost exclusively of brief pecking actions at the\nopenings with the beak tip or with a tool, while the kea’s\nmanipulations included violent pulling and tearing as well as\nrocking, probing, scratching, and levering of the physical parts of\nthe apparatus.\nFigure 2.

After the string solution was blocked, the subsequent\norder of solutions established differed between the two species and,\nin kea, between individuals (see Table 1).\nThree NCCs next reached criterion using the stick tools\n(between session 4 and 12) and, when this option was blocked,\ntwo of these reached criterion with the ball tool (in sessions 8 & 13;\nsee Table 1). Finally, one of these two crows (Ue ´k) solved the\nwindow hook task. In many cases the crows touched the window\n(which could not be opened that way) with a stick, rather than\ntrying to pull the hook. On average 31.77% +/28.00 SE, N = 3 of\nthe ineffective tool actions (ITA = inserting or bringing the tool\ninto contact with an inappropriate opening; note that in an ITA a\ntool has to touch an opening and not just any part of the\napparatus) in the trials in which the crows finally used a tool to\nretrieve the reward were directed against the window option. In\nfact, after learning to open the window by pulling from the hook,\nUe´k always reached for a stick and used it to poke the reward out,\ninstead of sticking her head through the window and taking the\nreward directly, as the kea did (see Movie S2).\nThe kea met criterion in either the ‘ball’ or the ‘window’ option\nafter the string solution was blocked (all kea finished these three\nsolutions). After these options were closed as well, all attempted to\nuse a stick tool, touching the box several times at the appropriate\nside with the stick (i.e. carrying the tool to the correct opening and\ntouching it with the tool), but failed to insert it. Only one kea,\nKermit, succeeded in developing a successful technique to retrieve\nthe reward with the stick. Due to the curvature of their beaks, kea\ncannot hold a stick in alignment with their heads to the same\ndegree as New Caledonian crows and as a consequence have less\ncontrol over the tip of the tool. Kermit developed a special routine.\nHe (1) took the tool end laterally into his beak and pushed that end\ninto or against the tool entrance. (2) He then switched from\ngrabbing the stick with the beak to grabbing it with the foot,\ncontinuing to press the tool end against the opening, (3)\nMeanwhile he shifted the beak to the end of the tool that was\ndistal to the opening securing the tool’s position with the foot at\nthe tool entrance. Finally (4) he directed the tool through the\nopening with his beak and manoeuvred it until it hit the reward\n(see Movies S1, S2). Kermit successfully used the stick tool for the\nfirst time three sessions after all other openings had been closed (in\nsession eight) and reached criterion in session ten.\nSpeed in switching from one solution to the next\nThe kea tended to be faster than the NCCs at meeting criterion\nin new solutions once the previous method was blocked. They took\nless sessions on average (1.3 +/20.21 SE, N = 6) to switch from the\nfirst to the second option than the three crows that did master a\nsecond option (which took 4, 11 and 2 sessions; Mann-Whitney U\ntest; Z = 2.19; p = 0.048). The kea took on average 1.67 +/20.21\nSE, N = 6 sessions to switch from option 2 to option 3 while the\ntwo crows that mastered a third option, took 4 and 5 sessions\nrespectively (Mann-Whitney U test; Z = 2.145; p = 0.071). Only\none subject of each species mastered a fourth option. The crow\ntook 4 sessions to reach criterion from the ball (3 rd option) to the\nwindow (4th option), while the kea took 5 sessions to reach criterion\nfrom the ball option (3 rd option) to the stick (4 th option; see\nTable 1). Establishing the stick solution after the string solution\nhad been blocked, took the three successful crows 5.8 sessions on\naverage even though the task taps into their proven skills as natural\ntool users (Table 1 & Figure 2).\nTool preference and other analyses related to the tool\nsolutions\nThe crows only successfully used the thin sticks and the single\nsuccessful kea used only the thick sticks. Both species used both\nsizes of ball tools.\nAfter the string opening had been blocked, the mean number of\ntimes the kea brought a ball tool into contact (by touch or\ninsertion) with the apparatus’s openings was significantly higher\nthan with a stick (Wilcoxon signed-rank; T = 2.02; p = 0.043).\nAfter the ball option was blocked, balls were removed after three\nunsuccessful sessions in which all options except for the stick\noption were blocked for 5 of the 6 kea, because they continued to\nmake attempts to use these now non-functional objects as tools.\nNevertheless, no additional kea managed to reach the food with a\nstick. For the crows the reverse situation was true; they tended to\ntouch openings with the sticks more often than with the balls.\nHowever, this was only significant at the 6% level (Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank; T = 1.87; p = 0.06).\nTable 1.Order and session in which each individual reached criterion (8 consecutive times correct or 9 out of 10 correct) for each\nof the four solutions (string, window, ball and stick).\nSpecies Ind 1 stsolution Session 2 ndsolution Session 3 rdsolution Session 4 thsolution Session\nKea Br String 3 Window 4 Ball 6 - -\nFr String 2 Window 3 Ball 5 - -\nKe String 2 Ball 4 Window 5 Stick 10\nLu String 2 Window 4 Ball 5 - -\nPi String 3 Window 4 Ball 6 - -\nTa String 3 Ball 4 Window 6 - -\nAverage 2.5 3.83 5.5 10\nNCC Bk String 2 - - - - - -\nEy String 2 Stick 8 Ball 13 - -\nTi String 1 Stick 12 - - - -\nUe´k String 2 Stick 4 Ball 8 Window 12\nAverage 1.75 8 10.5 12\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020231.t001\nProblem Solving in Kea and New Caledonian Crows\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20231\nThe three crows that did reach criterion using tools tried to\ninsert the stick more often into openings than the six kea (Mann-\nWhitney U test; Z = 2.59; p = 0.01) whilst the kea combined the\nball more often than the crows (Mann-Whitney U test; Z = 1.9;\np = 0.05).\nWe find similar preferences looking only at trials in which\nineffective tool actions occurred(see Figure 3). The kea brought the\nball more often into contact with an inappropriate opening (excluding\ntrials in which the performance was immediately successful) than the\nNCCs (Mann-Whitney U test; Z = 2.32; p = 0.024).\nIn trials including ITAs, the kea also inserted the ball into\nopenings such as the string or the stick opening rather than the\nwindow, while the NCCs also touched the window opening\nfrequently with a stick tool (see Figure 3). In incorrect tool use\ntrials, in which the animals conducted ineffective ITA before\nsucceeding to insert the tool appropriately, the average number of\nITA per trial was similar in crows and kea (see Table 2).\nDiscussion\nAt least one individual of each species discovered all four\navailable methods. This proves that in principle, the affordances of\nthe tasks lay within the cognitive and physical capacity of both\nspecies.\nThere were, however, interesting differences in performance\nwith the present set of tasks. The kea were faster in discovering\nmultiple solutions and showed more individual variation than the\nnaturally tool-using NCCs. Within the first session, all kea\nsuccessfully employed at least two or three solutions while none\nof the crows used more than one. The kea also switched to other\nsolutions quicker once previously mastered solutions were blocked.\nAlthough both species had experience with compact objects\n[18,24,30], using the ball was acquired faster by the kea, while in\nthe stick option the naturally stick-tool using NCCs were faster.\nOnly one kea succeeded in inserting the stick tool into the correct\nopening, although all attempted to do so.\nTo a large extent, differences in exploration patterns and\naffordance learning as well the balance between neophilia/\nneophobia seem to be responsible for the differential performance.\nThe kea showed more haptic exploration while the crows,\nprobably due to their higher level of neophobia, seemed to\nexplore more in a visually guided manner. Similar differences exist\nbetween kea and common ravens [36]. The kea’s higher readiness\nto manipulate i.e. act on novel objects, may help them to detect\nfunctional affordances. In their naturally low-risk, variable\nenvironment, neophilia may reflect low predation risk [20,37].\nThe crows, in contrast, approached the apparatus hesitantly, and\ntouched it less often than the kea.

(The string option was the\nfirst to be blocked for both species. It may have represented one of\nthe more conspicuous affordances of the apparatus or evoked little\nneophobia since both species were familiar with strings; see\nmethods). It is possible that because the available sticks were\nsmoother, painted, and considerably thicker than those the crows\nnaturally choose in the wild [38] ergonomic difficulties synergised\nwith neophobia, and may have affected their performance. Once\nthe crows had established stick tool use, they continued to use the\nsticks for exploring the box instead of touching it directly. This is\nreflected in the number of ITA with sticks when confronted with\nthe ball and window option, i.e. after the stick option was blocked.\nThis may indicate a preference to explore unfamiliar objects with\ntools rather than touching them directly, as shown by Wimpenny\net al. (2010) [39]. Such behaviour is, however, disadvantageous in\nsituations where the functionalities of the objects are not detectable\nby simply applying pressure, such as in the case of the window\noption, illustrating one cost of the otherwise useful capacity to use\ntools for exploratory goals.\nAnother strong difference was that the kea showed greater\ndestructiveness than the crows, as a consequence of their forceful\nand frequent use of pulling and tearing actions. One kea, Luke,\neven broke the Plexiglas H on the top of the box while trying to\nforce it open, and most kea attempted to turn over the MAB,\nwhich had to be fixed to the aviary floor. Wild kea are well-known\nfor what human observers usually describe as curiosity, playfulness\nand urge to tear apart objects such as cars’ windshield wipers or\npicnic baskets [27].\nWild (as well as naı¨ve captive) NCCs also use tearing actions\nwhen manufacturing tools from pandanus leaves [29,40]. They\nhowever did not use such behaviours in this setup. We can at this\npoint speculate that tearing behaviours may mainly be orientated\ntowards tool making and nest building rather than to exploration of\nnovel objects or food extraction. The slight curvature at the beak tip\nof most corvids has been interpreted as an adaptation to feeding on\ncarcasses [41]. NCCs might have secondarily lost their beak\ncurvature making their beaks less suited for violent tearing actions.\nVery recently Rutz et al. (2010) [42] were able to show that a\nsubstantial amount of the crows’ protein and lipid intake came from\nwood boring beetle larvae obtained with stick tools, also indicating\nthat explorative foraging is more concentrated on probing actions. It\nseems therefore possible that the range of exploration techniques\nduring foraging in NCC may be constrained by the adaptive\nspecialization for tool use and that this will affect the ‘‘zone of latent\nsolutions’’ [43] within the species’ cognitive repertoire.\nOur results also provide the first experimental evidence of stick\ntool use in a parrot. Kea are neither natural tool users like New\nCaledonian crows, nor do they construct nests with twigs as all\ncorvids do, thus lacking the predisposition of nest builders for\nhandling twigs and other elongated stick-like objects [44]. Instead,\nkea use or dig burrows for laying their eggs [45]. Also importantly,\nergonomically, the use of sticks is clearly difficult for kea. The\ncurvature of their beaks and pronounced size difference between\nupper and lower beak, precludes a good grip and control of long,\nstraight tools. NCCs, maybe as an adaptation to tool use [41],\nhave short straight beaks with the mandible almost as long as the\nmaxilla, allowing them to effectively hold sticks directly forwards,\nfunctionally elongating their beaks and increasing their reach.\nTo overcome these difficulties, the single successful individual\nkea developed a complicated stepwise technique, involving\ncarefully concerted foot and bill actions (see Movie S1). This\npermitted the subject to insert and direct a stick tool despite the\nspecies’ morphological constraints. Kermit’s performance indi-\ncates a high degree of deliberate control over his movements,\nsuggestive of anticipation of their effect and perhaps a represen-\ntation of the goal action, i.e. of inserting the stick into the opening.\nProof of goal directedness or goal representation, however,\nrequires specific tests that were not implemented here [46].\nOur study illustrates the difficulties of comparative cognition\nresearch and points to some partial solutions. Clearly, no single-\ntask exploration can be used to assess problem-solving ability or\nmake claims for advanced general intelligence or innovativeness.\nThis caveat applies to within as well as between species\ncomparisons. Problem solving is intrinsically multi-dimensional\nand it is to be expected that individuals or species will outperform\neach other in different dimensions. Batteries of tasks designed with\nthis in mind may however be highly informative about the\ndifferent predispositions and cognitive competences across indi-\nviduals and species.\nMethods\nSubjects\nSix male kea (Frowin, Kermit, Pick, Tammy, Bruce and Luke),\nas well as five New Caledonian crows (Boycott, Annie-Claude,\nTino, Ebony and Ue ´k), two of which were male (Boycott and\nTino) participated in this study. Three kea (Kermit, Pick and\nTammy) as well as one crow (Uek) were hand-raised. Bruce, Luke\nand Frowin were parent-raised in captivity; Annie-Claude, Tino,\nEbony and Boycott were wild caught but had laboratory\nexperience. Bruce and Luke were seven, Frowin, Pick and Kermit\nfive, Tammy three and Uek, five years old. All subjects had\nexperience in experimental problem-solving setups substantially\ndifferent from that used here [8,17,18,24,30,47,48]. The NCC had\nparticipated in a test where they dropped stones into vertical tubes\n[24]. Kea also inserted objects into vertical tubes (unpublished\ndata) and participated in follow up tool-use experiments with loose\nrewarded tubes or tubes in a slanted position and compact tools\n[18,30]. Both the NCC and the kea had experiences with strings:\nthe kea had participated in a vertical string-pulling task [32, and\nunpublished data] and the crows were given experience, pulling\n30 cm long strings (of different colour and diameter as during\ntesting) up a perch prior to a yet unpublished study. The crows\nhad experience with stick tools within experimental and natural\ncontexts.\nThe kea were housed in a large outdoor aviary (15 m 610 m\n64 m) in a group totalling 20 kea, while the crows were kept in pairs\nin outdoor aviaries of various shapes, with an average volume of\napproximately 50 m\n3 and access to heated indoor divisions (ca.\n8m 3), with food and drinking water ad libitum. The experiments\nwere strictly non-invasive and based purely on behavioral tests. All\nsubjects were housed in accordance with Austrian and German law.\nApparatus\nWe designed and used a Multi-Access-Box (MAB) consisting of\na cubic box (23 cm by side; for details and further dimensions see\nFigure 1, see additionally Figures S1, S2, S3, S4, S5; Movie S2)\nwith four exchangeable transparent walls (the dimensions were\nadequate for both species). Each wall contained an opening that\ncould be used to access a food reward presented in the centre of\nthe box, either directly or by means of a tool. The food reward\n(half a peanut in its shell for the kea; a mealworm inside half a\npeanut shell for the NCC) was positioned on a vertical pole in the\ncentre of the box, which was attached to a slanted platform. Once\nthe food fell off the pole it rolled down the platform and out of the\nbox.\nProblem Solving in Kea and New Caledonian Crows\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20231\nThere were four possible solutions (‘string’, ‘window’, ‘ball’ and\n‘stick’) through which the out-of-reach food could be obtained, two\nof which (‘ball’ and ‘stick’) involved the use of tools. (i) The ’string’\nsolution required the subjects to pull a string (20 cm) hanging out\nof the opening in the respective wall, the other end of which was\ntied to the reward. (ii) In the ‘window’ option, a hinged window in\nthe sidewall of the box could be opened by grasping a hook-like\nhandle with the beak, pulling he window open and thereafter\nreaching into the box to retrieve the food from the pole (or pushing\nit off the pole with a stick). (iii) To exploit the ‘ball’ option, a\ncompact object (a marble) had to be inserted into the respective\nopening, which connected to a transparent tube bending towards\nthe central pole. When inserted into the tube the ball rolled down\nthe chute and knocked the reward off the pole. (iv) Finally, the\nopening corresponding to the ‘stick’ solution was connected to a\n(8 mm) short straight horizontal tube at the same height as the\nfood, but with a ten centimetre gap to the pole (Figure 1). Here,\nthe food could be obtained by inserting a stick tool in the correct,\nhence unobstructed, opening, manoeuvring it towards the pole\nand hitting the peanut (kea) or stuffed peanut shell (NCCs).\nAll openings except for the window had the same round shape\nand diameter, hence were superficially perceptually similar, but\ncould be distinguished by the visible internal structure (see\nFigure 1). Four sticks (15 cm long) and four balls, all painted with\nyellow childproof acrylic varnish, were provided in two different\nsizes. Two of the four supplied sticks were broad and two thin\n(0.5 cm and 1,5 cm in diameter respectively), whilst the balls were\ntwo large and two small marbles. The potential tools were placed\nin the four corners of the MAB so that each corner had one stick\nand one marble (the possible combinations of tool diameters were\nrandomly assigned). The MAB was turned around before each\ntrial and the walls were switched; so that the openings were at\nrandomly changing positions.\nExperimental procedure\nPrior to the start of the actual tests, the birds received at least\nfour familiarization trials, in which each of the walls was missing\nonce so the birds could just reach into the box and take the food\nreward. The crows, which are more neophobic than the kea,\nreceived as many familiarization trials as necessary to recover the\nreward in less than three minutes.\nDuring testing, subjects were visually isolated from their group/\nmates and received a maximum of ten trials per session. A trial\ncontinued until the reward was recovered or until ten minutes had\npassed. If an animal did not obtain the reward within ten minutes\ntesting continued the following day. A trial was scored as correct if\nthe bird obtained the reward by applying one of the four solutions\ndescribed above without prior unsuccessful attempts to solve the\nproblem in a different way, e.g. previously manipulating other\nopenings or combining the tools with wrong openings. The first\nsuccessful retrieval of the food from a new opening (the bird may\nhave manipulated other entrances in the same trial) was scored as\na ‘discovery’.\nInitially all openings were available. Once a subject reached\ncriterion for one solution (obtaining the reward by always using the\nsame solution for two consecutive sessions, but also after nine\ncorrect trials within one session (of ten trials) or eight consecutive\ncorrect trials using the same solution within one session), the\nrespective opening was blocked (the window was cemented into its\nframe, the string was removed and the tool entrances were blocked\nwith a wooden stopper), so as to force the subject to shift to other\nsolutions. Testing continued until the animals failed to recover the\nreward within ten minutes in three consecutive trials or until all\nopenings were closed. In order to determine whether each species\nhad the capacity for each tool option, if just one of the two tool\nopenings remained open, and the birds failed to solve it three\nconsecutive times, we gave them a ‘second chance’ (another three\ntrials) and removed the tools that belonged to the tool task they\nhad previously solved, so as to remove possible distracting factors.\nWe reasoned that the birds may fail to solve a tool task simply\nbecause they might not be able to inhibit using a tool which has\nbeen strongly associated to food before.\nAll data was videotaped. We used SPSS for statistical analysis.\nSupporting Information\nMovie S1 This video shows the complex motor technique used\nby the male kea Kermit to insert the rod shaped tool into the\nappropriate opening as described in the results section.\n(AVI)\nMovie S2 This ‘Kea-crow suite movie’ shows both species, kea\nand New Caledonian crows, employing all four different solutions\nof the Multi Access Box apparatus: string, ball, stick and window.\nThe video illustrates the techniques used to employ the fourth and\nfinal solution of the two animals, the kea Kermit and the crow\nUek, that mastered all tasks: the crow Uek uses a tool to poke the\nreward off its platform after opening the window solution and the\nkea Kermit uses a complex multi step technique to insert the stick\ntool into the appropriate opening (as described in detail in the\nresults section).\n(M4V)\nFigure S1 This image depicts a kea inserting a ball tool into the\nappropriate opening.\n(JPG)\nFigure S2 This image depicts a New Caledonian crow inserting\na ball tool into the appropriate opening.\n(JPG)\nFigure S3 This image depicts the crow Uek retrieving the\nreward from the window opening using a stick tool.\n(JPG)\nFigure S4 This image depicts a kea opening the window\nsolution.\n(JPG)\nFigure S5 This image depicts a kea inserting the stick tool into\nthe appropriate opening.\n(JPG)\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Lukas Auersperg for technical support in\nconstructing and drawing the apparatus and Sabine Tebbich for useful\ncomments on a previous version of the manuscript.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: AA AB GG.
