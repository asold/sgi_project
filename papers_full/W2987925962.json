E-mail:n.raihani@ucl.ac.uk\nAbstract\nHumans are outstanding in their ability to cooperate with unrelated individuals, and punishment– paying\na cost to harm others– is thought to be a key supporting mechanism. According to this view, cooperators\npunish defectors, who respond by behaving more cooperatively in future interactions. However, a synthe-\nsis of the evidence from laboratory and real-world settings casts serious doubts on the assumption that the\nsole function of punishment is to convert cheating individuals into cooperators. Instead, punishment often\nprompts retaliation and punishment decisions frequently stem from competitive, rather than deterrent\nmotives. Punishment decisions often reflect the desire to equalise or elevate payoffs relative to targets,\nrather than the desire to enact revenge for harm received or to deter cheats from reoffending in future.\nWe therefore suggest that punishment also serves a competitive function, where what looks like spiteful\nbehaviour actually allows punishers to equalise or elevate their own payoffs and/or status relative to targets\nindependently of any change in the target’s behaviour. Institutions that reduce or remove the possibility\nthat punishers are motivated by relative payoff or status concerns might offer a way to harness these com-\npetitive motives and render punishment more effective at restoring cooperation.\nKeywords: Competition; cooperation; fairness; punishment; spite\nMedia summary:Punishment is thought to be a powerful driver of human cooperation but it does not\noften convert defectors into cooperators. In addition, punishment is frequently aimed at cooperators,\nor individuals who did nothing wrong, and often prompts retaliation rather than cooperation. We\nhighlight what we believe is a relatively neglected role of punishment: it is a form of competition,\nwhereby punishers equalise or elevate their own payoffs in relation to others. Cultural institutions\nthat limit potential for competitive punishment might have played a vital role in harnessing humans’\ncompetitive motives and rendering punishment more effective at restoring cooperation.\n1. Introduction\nIn what has become a classic study, Clutton-Brock and Parker (1995) defined punishment as occurring\nwhen: (a) one individual cheats by performing an action that lowers the partner’s payoff, relative to\nalternative actions; (b) the harmed individual incurs a temporary payoff reduction to reduce the pay-\noffs of the cheating individual; (c) the target then behaves more cooperatively in future interactions\nwith the punisher and hence causes the punisher’s payoffs to increase. This definition overlaps with\nwhat Boyd and Richerson (1992) earlier called ‘retribution’. Common to both definitions is the\nidea that there is (a) a cause, (b) the punishment act and (c) the future benefits of the act that explain\nwhy punishment is under positive selection. We note that some authors have argued that punishment\ncan also include acts that do not require the punisher to experience any immediate costs (Boyd and\nRicherson 1992; Nakao and Machery2012), as is the case with withholding benefits from, or recipro-\ncally exploiting, cheats (Bhuiet al. 2019; Boyd 2017).

More puzzling is when and why a tendency to\ninvest in behaviour directed at harming others can ever be under positive selection– and as such\nwe prefer to stick with definitions that assume that punishment is at least temporarily costly to admin-\nister (Úbeda and Duéñez-Guzmán2011).\nAlthough punishment is undoubtedly more common among humans than non-human species\n(Raihani et al. 2012a), it has been documented in a handful of species, such as among cleaner fish\nand their reef-fish clients, among male – female pairs of cleaner fish and in vervet monkeys\n(Arseneau-Robar et al. 2016, 2018;B s h a r ya n dG r u t t e r2002;R a i h a n iet al. 2010). In the cleaner\nfish mutualism, clients may use punishment to make cleaners eat their ectoparasites rather than\ntheir protective mucus, which is preferred by cleaners (Grutter and Bshary 2003). A second\nform of punishment is administered by male cleaners towards their female partners if the latter\ncheat a shared client (Raihani et al. 2010, 2012b). Finally, in vervet monkeys, males and females\nof the same group may punish each other during intergroup encounters (Arseneau-Robaret al.\n2016), with males punishing females who initiate attacks (Arseneau-Robaret al. 2018) and females\npunishing males who do not participate. While the focus in this paper is on punishment in\nhumans, it will be helpful to keep these examples in mind, as we shall return to the ways that pun-\nishment in humans might (or might not) differ from what we see in other species in our conclud-\ning remarks.\nSome of the first work to experimentally explore punishment in humans was done in laboratory\nstudies using economic games (Fehr and Gächter2000, 2002a; Yamagishi 1986). These classic stud-\nies showed that people will pay for a sanctioning mechanism (Yamagishi1986)o rw i l lt a k ei tu p o n\nthemselves to punish co-players who do not contribute to a public good (Fehr and Gächter2000,\n2002a), even though the costs of punishment are personalised and the benefits of punishment (in\nterms of increased contributions to the public good) are shared among punishers and non-punishers\nalike. The findings of these studies lent credence to theoretical arguments that punishment can (some-\ntimes) be viewed as a second-order public good (Boydet al. 2003; Boyd and Richerson1992), although\nsubsequent work suggested that punishment might more often fit the payoffs of the volunteer’sd i l e m m a\n(Raihani and Bshary2011), where investments can be self-serving rather than altruistic. Nevertheless,\nthese early studies have been highly influential in informing theories of human cooperation.\nNevertheless, the conclusions have since been challenged in two ways. First studies on non-WEIRD sub-\njects (where WEIRD stands for Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic; Henrichet al.\n2010a, b;J o n e s2010) and studies conducted in field settings suggest that people may not be as willing to\npunish as the laboratory studies with Western undergraduates imply. Second, many follow-up laboratory\nstudies on WEIRD subjects that alter important details of the experimental design and that study the\nmotives underlying punishment in more detail have produced diverging results. These discrepancies\nare potentially important since many accounts of the evolution of cooperation in humans have invoked\npunishment as a key supporting mechanism (Boydet al.\n2003; Chudek and Henrich2011;G i n t i set al.\n2003;R a i h a n iet al.2012a; Raihani and Bshary2015a).\nWe start by reviewing the literature on the behavioural and economic consequences of punishment in\neconomic games, as well as a selective survey of data from punishment in the real world. Our aim is not\nto provide a comprehensive review of ethnographic observations but rather to provide an illustrative over-\nview of key patterns and to identify open questions in the field. We will outline an alternative functional\nhypothesis for punishment, which we call the‘competitive function’, arguing that this has been relatively\nunderstudied and yet deserves more theoretical and empirical attention. Finally, we discuss the different\nempirical predictions that can be made based on different functional accounts of punishment.\n2. The evolution of punishment\nIn humans, punishment has often been studied in the context of stylised laboratory games (Chaudhuri\n2011; Guala2012), where individuals can pay a small monetary cost to inflict a (usually) larger fine on\n2 Nichola J. Raihani and Redouan Bshary\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\na target. These laboratory games have emphasised people’s willingness to punish others for transgres-\nsions (Fehr and Gächter 2000, 2002a; Yamagishi 1986), including when they were not the victim\n(‘third-party punishment’; Fehr and Fischbacher 2004). In the case of second-party punishment,\nwhere the punisher was the victim (or one victim) of the cheating individual, it is often assumed\nthat the punisher can reap a return on investment because of a change in the target’s behaviour\n(e.g. Clutton-Brock and Parker1995), or because a bystander observes the punishment and this deters\nthe bystander from defecting when they interact with the punisher (dos Santos et al. 2013).\nThird-party punishment is thought to be more puzzling from an evolutionary perspective, but this\nis largely due to the assumption that the third party will not interact with the target of punishment\nagain in the future. This assumption– like second-party punishment in one-round games– makes\nit more difficult to reconcile the costly act of punishment with the possibility for downstream benefits\nfor the punisher. Recent theoretical work has indicated that third-party punishers may nevertheless\nbenefit when their punitive reputation is known to future interaction partners, which is likely when\npopulations are relatively tightly structured and viscous (Rooset al.2014). Under these circumstances,\nthe possibility for future interactions with the target of punishment or with bystanders who observe\nthe punishment act seems to be a more important factor in understanding how punishers can be com-\npensated for their investments, than whether the punisher was the original victim of the cheating indi-\nvidual or not.\nBefore discussing the empirical literature, it is worth bearing in mind that many of the studies we\ncite were conducted in the laboratory using WEIRD participants (but see for notable exceptions\nEnsminger and Henrich 2014; Gächter and Herrmann 2011; Henrich 2000; Henrich et al. 2010c,\n2005, 2006; Herrmann et al. 2008; Marlowe 2009; Marlowe et al. 2008; Marlowe, et al. 2011;\nWiessner 2009). In contrast to the laboratory studies, data from the real world suggest that people\nare often unwilling to punish when opportunities to do so arise (Balafoutaset al. 2014a; Baumard\n2010; Guala 2012; Pedersen et al. 2018; but see Mathew and Boyd2011). The relatively high levels\nof punishment observed in laboratory games might therefore be an artefact that stems from the pau-\ncity of alternative options offered to participants (e.g. see Raihani and Bshary2015b). In real-world\nsettings, where alternative options are available (and where people might be involved in more than\none kind of social interaction with the same partner), people can withhold opportunities to help rather\nthan actively harm transgressors (Balafoutaset al. 2014a), can\n‘vote with their feet’ by either expelling\nor distancing themselves from offenders or free-riders (Boehm2001; Lee1979) or can use restorative\njustice that focuses on compensating victims for harm incurred rather than imposing penalties on the\nwrongdoers themselves (Hirschet al. 2003; Pupu and Wiessner2018; Wiessner and Pupu2012). In\naddition, work that has been conducted in non-industrial, small-scale societies typically finds that peo-\nple living in such societies are less willing to invest in punishment of others even in the context of\nartificial laboratory games (Henrichet al. 2010a; Wiessner 2009) and that investment in third-party\npunishment in particular is less common (Marloweet al. 2011). These caveats should be borne in\nmind when assessing the evidence below.\nAlthough theoretical work has emphasised that punishment can stabilise any behaviour within a\ngroup (Boyd and Richerson1992), researchers interested in the evolution of cooperation have been\nespecially interested in the idea that punishment can act as a tool to promote cooperation (the pathway\ndenoted by the red arrows inFig. 1). Under the assumption that punishment involves paying a cost to\nharm another individual, the higher fitness payoffs that result from the target’s increased cooperation\noffers one plausible mechanism by which such investments can be favoured by selection (Boyd and\nRicherson 1992; Clutton-Brock and Parker1995; Raihani et al. 2010). Punishers might additionally\nbenefit because their actions are witnessed by other individuals who then behave more cooperatively\nwith the punisher in future (dos Santoset al. 2011; dos Santos and Wedekind2015; Jordan and Rand\n2017; Raihani and Bshary2015b, c). Nevertheless, in laboratory games, humans willingly invest in\npunishment in scenarios where the act is not observed by others, where the punisher will not interact\nwith the target again in future, and/or where the benefits will be shared by other individuals, including\nnon-punishers. In such cases, punitive preferences could reflect a mismatch between the laboratory\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 3\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nenvironment and a human psychology that evolved in environments where interactions are truly one-\nshot and/or unobserved (e.g. Cosmides and Tooby1997; Toobyet al. 2006, but see Fehr and Henrich\n2003; Hillet al. 2014; Raihani and Bshary2015a) or could instead reflect a psychology that has been\nunder positive selection because of the effect punishment has on group success in the context of\nbetween-group competition (e.g. Boydet al. 2003; blue arrows inFig. 1).\nHere, we want to highlight what we believe is a neglected strategic goal of punishment: to compete\nwith others, rather than to encourage future cooperation. This possibility was mentioned as a footnote\nin Fehr and Gächter (2000) (see also Baumard2010; Boehm 2001; Cosmideset al. 2002; Nakao and\nMachery 2012; Saaksvuori et al. 2011). It also has similarities to the theory of inequity aversion pro-\nposed by Fehr and Schmidt (1999) as well as the levelling-down strategies used in traditional societies,\ndiscussed in Boehm (2001) in that, like the competitive punishment hypothesis, both of these theories\nemphasise that people should be sensitive to their own payoffs (or status) relative to others’. Previous\ntheoretical models have shown that punishment strategies that respond to relative payoffs (so-called\n‘egalitarian’ punishment strategies) can be equally or even more effective than punishment strategies\nthat rely on observing or correctly inferring the target’s strategy (Scheuring2010; Tamuraet al. 2011)\nand we agree with Scheuring (2010) that the assumption that punishers do always know the strategies\nof players they interact with is problematic when one considers that this may not always (or even\noften) be the case in the real world. Additionally, a recent theoretical model on the evolution of\ncooperation (which was modelled as respect for resource possession) found that cooperation was sta-\nbilised when resource holders (or other individuals) responded to‘raiding’ (attempts to steal the\nFigure 1. Possible feedback loops by which punishment could yield inclusive fitness benefits to punishers. Red arrows denote ben-\nefits that arise because punishment causes the target or bystanders to cooperate more (with dashed lines indicating that the\ncooperation is directed at punisher’s kin). Orange arrows denote benefits that arise because punishment changes the relative pay-\noff difference between punisher and target. This feedback loop assumes that competition is relatively local. Blue arrows denote\nbenefits that arise because competition between groups is stronger than competition within them. Blue arrows therefore assume\nthat competition is relatively global.\n4 Nichola J. Raihani and Redouan Bshary\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nresource) with retaliation (i.e. punishment). Nevertheless, when the level of inequality between\nresource-holders and resource-seekers exceeds a critical threshold (which can be thought of as akin\nto variation in payoff differences among players in a laboratory game), then cooperation collapses\nand raiding strategies come to dominate the population until this inequality is reduced. This\nmodel, although not explicitly framed in terms of cooperation and punishment, illustrates the evolu-\ntionary logic of considering relative payoff differences in understanding the evolution of cooperation\nand punishment in nature.\nA payoff-levelling goal might also reflect an alternative evolutionary pathway for punishment:\nunder local competition, it could be favoured simply because it allows punishers to reduce or remove\nfitness differentials between themselves and targets (Cosmideset al. 2002), to elevate their fitness\nabove targets or to gain indirect fitness benefits if their kin are the main beneficiaries of the target’s\nreduced competitiveness. The latter scenario, where the actor incurs lifetime fitness costs to impose\nfitness costs on another individual, fits the Hamiltonian definition of spite (Gardner and West\n2004). In these scenarios (orange arrows inFig. 1), no wrong-doing or altering of future behaviour\nof the target is necessary to explain the act of punishment and any behaviour change effect of pun-\nishment would be an exaptation. Importantly, the payoff consequences of acting upon punitive senti-\nments within the context of experimental games do not capture the direct and/or indirect fitness\nconsequences of punishment: preferences for punishment could have been favoured by selection\nnot because punishment tends to change targets’ behaviour but because it tends to leave the punisher\n(and/or his relatives) at a relative advantage. Under this view, punishment need not be restricted to\nthose who were the victims of the original cheating individual, and could be favoured even when\nthe punisher was an uninvolved third party.\nIn laboratory settings, this possibility for competition is often built into the design of the game\nsince the cost of punishment to the punisher is usually smaller than the negative impact on the target.\nThis confound is especially acute in studies that use variable fee-to-fine ratios (e.g. as in\nDenant-Boemont et al. 2007; Faillo et al. 2013; Fehr and Gächter 2000; Masclet et al. 2003;\nNikiforakis 2008a), where the punishment reduces the target’s earnings by a percentage rather than\na fixed sum. Under variable fee-to-fine ratios, punishers can have a larger impact on the payoffs of\ndefectors than on the payoffs of other cooperators (as pointed out by Casari2005).\nBelow we outline the key predictions made by the hypothesis that punishment is (primarily) a tool\nto promote cooperation, along with a brief summary of the theoretical and empirical evidence that\nsupports or undermines each prediction.\nPrediction 1: Punishers should also be cooperative individuals\nIn many models, the tendency to punish defectors is assumed to be linked to the tendency to cooper-\nate, meaning that a punisher can also be assumed to be a cooperator (although the reverse is not neces-\nsarily true; Andrés Guzmánet al.2007; Bowles and Gintis2004; Boydet al. 2003; Boyd and Richerson\n1992; Henrich and Boyd2001, but see Huanget al. 2018; Eriksson et al. 2014; Lehmann et al. 2007;\nÚbeda and Duéñez-Guzmán2011). This assumption has also been described in terms of a psycho-\nlogical propensity to behave as a strong reciprocator (an individual that has a preference to condition-\nally cooperate and to punish non-cooperators; Gintis2000). The theoretical basis of this assumption is\nthat preferences for strong reciprocity reflect an underlying, more general preference for fairness.\nIndividuals that have such fairness preferences are prepared to incur personal costs to prevent unequal\noutcomes from occurring or to reduce the extent of inequality (Fehr and Schmidt1999). Nevertheless,\nseveral lines of empirical evidence refute this prediction. For example, in a one-shot public goods\ngame, the tendency to cooperate was unrelated to punitive tendencies: free-riders punished just as\nmuch as cooperators in this setting (Weberet al. 2018). Similarly, using a series of social dilemma\ntasks, Yamagishi and colleagues ( 2012) found that the tendency to reject unfair offers in the\nUltimatum Game (which has been interpreted as a form of costly punishment owing to strong reci-\nprocity preferences; Fehr and Fischbacher2003; Fehr and Gächter 2002b; Gintis et al. 2003)w a s\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 5\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nunrelated to prosocial behaviour in other games (see also Albrechtet al. 2018; Brañas-Garza et al.\n2014; Eriksson et al. 2014; Hoeft and Mill2017; Kriss et al. 2016; Peysakhovich et al. 2014). Thus,\nthe preference for cooperation and for punishment does not appear to be as tightly linked as theories\nbased on strong reciprocity preferences imply, and evolutionary simulations on two-player interactions\nobtain as an outcome of natural selection (Wubset al. 2016).\nPrediction 2: Punishment should cause targets to behave more cooperatively in future\nIn human studies, stylised economic games have been used to compare how cooperation levels differ as\na function of whether punishment is possible or not. Evidence that cooperation is higher when pun-\nishment is possible (compared with when it is not) has often been taken as evidence that punishment\ncauses cheaters to cooperate in future rounds (Ambrus and Greiner2012; Cinyabuguma et al. 2006;\nFehr and Gächter2000, 2002a; Fischeret al. 2016; Mascletet al.2003; Ones and Putterman2007; Page\net al. 2013; Pfattheicher et al. 2018; Reuben and Riedl 2009; Rockenbach and Milinski 2006; van\nMiltenburg et al. 2017). However, we suggest that this conclusion is premature because the evidence\nis correlational, with several alternative explanations that need to be excluded.\nFirst, in some studies, analyses showing that targets who are punished in roundt increase their\ninvestments in roundt + 1 do not control for the mean level of cooperation in the group and thus\ndo not rule out the possibility that participants are conditionally cooperating (by responding to the\nhigher contributions of other group members) rather than responding to punishment (e.g. Fehr\nand Gächter 2000, 2002a; Pfattheicher et al. 2018; Rockenbach and Milinski 2006; Shinada and\nYamagishi 2007). Studies in two-player settings indicate that the likelihood of a defector cooperating\nin round t + 1 hinges crucially on whether the partner cooperated in roundt (Barclay and Raihani\n2016; Boneet al. 2015, 2016). Once this conditional cooperation is accounted for, then the additional\neffect of punishment on inducing cheats to cooperate is absent (Barclay and Raihani2016; Boneet al.\n2015, 2016). Similar results have been obtained in the context ofn-player games (de Melo and Piaggi\n2015; Kirchkamp and Mill2018; Randet al. 2009; Seftonet al. 2007), and others have even found that\nreceiving punishment can reduce a target’s propensity to cooperate in the next round (e.g. Anderson\nand Stafford 2003; Aquino et al.\n2015; Barclay and Raihani2016; Bone et al. 2015, 2016; Fehr and\nRockenbach 2003; Janssenet al.2010; Zheng and Nie2013). While the proposed reasons given differ\naccording to the experimental setting, one general finding seems to be that the use of punishment is\nperceived as morally dubious. Therefore, when one player pays a cost to harm another or announces\nthat she will do this if the partner does not bestow benefits upon her, this can erase any cooperative\nsentiment that might otherwise exist among interaction partners. In other words, the threat of pun-\nishment can be said to‘crowd out’ the motivation to cooperate.\nRelatedly, it is unclear to what extent punishment increases cooperation by converting defectors\ninto co-operators (i.e. increasing the number of co-operators), or by increasing the contributions of\nconditional co-operators (see Kirchkamp and Mill 2018; Lergetporer et al. 2014; Shinada and\nYamagishi 2007; Yamagishi1986). In a recent experimental study, the number of free-riders increased\nunder the threat of punishment, relative to a condition where no punishment was possible (Kirchkamp\nand Mill2018). By way of explanation for this counter-intuitive result, the authors posit either a pos-\nsible crowding out effect (where any intrinsic motivation to cooperate might be extinguished by the\nextrinsic threat of punishment) or the possibility that people expected to be punished and thus\nattempted to minimise payoff losses ex ante by defecting. Despite the increased numbers of free-riders,\ntotal contributions under the threat of punishment were still higher because conditional cooperators\nmade higher contributions under the threat of punishment compared with when no punishment was pos-\nsible. These results suggest that the threat of punishment might be working more as an assurance to peo-\nple who are already willing to cooperate as long as they assume others will as well (even if that assumption\nwas mistaken in this specific study), rather than a stick to change the behaviour of free-riders.\nThe idea that punishment should convert cheaters into cooperators is largely based on classical\npayoff-based thinking. In economics, it is assumed that individuals try to maximise expected utility\n6 Nichola J. Raihani and Redouan Bshary\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nand will respond to incentives that change this utility function (like punishment) by changing their\nbehaviour (e.g. by not committing a crime) (Becker1968). Similarly, behavioural ecologists assumed\nthat natural selection will cause the evolution of strategies that make individuals behave more coopera-\ntively in response to being punished (Clutton-Brock and Parker1995). Assuming payoff-based deci-\nsion rules, more severe punishments should act as a stronger deterrent against future offending. Both\nreal-world and empirical studies challenge this prediction. In experimental settings that have manipu-\nlated power asymmetries between players, defectors were not more likely to change their behaviour\nwhen they were punished by a strong vs a weak partner (Boneet al. 2015, 2016). In the real world,\nit is now well known that harsh sentences, like the death penalty, are no more effective in deterring\ncrime than less harsh ones (Tonry 2018), and a recent quasi-experimental study based on more\nthan 100,000 individuals convicted of a violent crime found that harsher punishments (in the form\nof prison sentences) were not more effective than lighter punishments (probation sentences) at pre-\nventing convicts from re-offending (Hardinget al. 2019).\nLaboratory studies that do report a positive effect of punishment on the future cooperative behav-\niour of targets also highlight its context-specificity. For example, defectors sometimes respond to light\nbut not harsh punishment (Mascletet al.2003; see also Houseret al.2008; Jianget al.2013); punish-\nment induces defectors to cooperate in early but not later rounds (Denant-Boemontet al.2007); and\nthe way in which feedback is provided affects how defectors respond to being punished– in a public\ngoods game setting, people are less likely to cooperate in response to being punished if they are shown\ninformation about their co-players’ earnings, rather than their contributions (Nikiforakis2008b). The\nefficacy of punishment also seems to vary cross-culturally: a meta-analysis of punishment across 18\nsocieties found that the possibility of being punished increased cooperation more in wealthier and\nhigh-trust societies than in poorer, lower-trust societies (Balliet and Van Lange2013). We also note\nthat the same meta-analysis uncovered evidence suggestive of a publication bias in favour of studies\nfinding a positive effect of punishment on cooperation.\nThere are also apparent methodological issues that may affect the effects of punishment. Most stud-\nies that report an overall positive correlative effect of the option to punish on levels of cooperation\npreclude targets of punishment from retaliating (either because they shuffle group membership\neach round (e.g. Fehr and Gächter2000, 2002a) or because the punisher’s identity is not revealed\nto targets (e.g. Fehr and Gächter2000). If this restriction is removed, punishment frequently prompts\nretaliation rather than cooperation, particularly when punishers are not anonymous, or if targets can\ninfer who might have punished them previously (e.g. Balafoutaset al. 2014b; Bone et al. 2015, 2016;\nDenant-Boemont et al. 2007; Dreber, et al. 2008; Engelmann and Nikiforakis2015; Fehl et al. 2012;\nNikiforakis 2008a; Nikiforakis and Engelmann2011;W u et al. 2009; Zheng and Nie2013\n). Perhaps\nfor this reason, punishment is often inefficient, leading to lower collective payoffs than when no pun-\nishment is possible (e.g. Ambrus and Greiner2012; Aquinoet al.2015; Bochetet al.2006; Burnham\n2014; Chaudhuri 2011; Egas and Riedl 2008; Gächter and Herrmann 2011; Gächter et al. 2017;\nHopfensitz and Reuben2009;O s t r o met al. 1992; Rand et al. 2009; Vukov et al. 2013; Walker and\nHalloran 2004;W u et al. 2009; but see Gächteret al. 2008). The empirical literature on the effects\nof retaliation is matched by the theoretical literature. For instance, most models exploring the evolu-\ntion of costly punishment need to prevent retaliatory or antisocial punishment strategies in order to\nmake it work (Randet al.2010); when these are allowed then punishment typically fails to support the\nevolution of cooperation (Hauseret al. 2014; Janssen and Bushman2008; Rand and Nowak2011).\nEven when retaliation is not an issue, theoretical work also questions the extent to which increased\ngroup payoffs can be achieved through punishment owing to the value-destroying nature of punish-\nment (Egas and Riedl2008; Ohtsuki et al. 2009; Vukovet al. 2013).\nPrediction 3. Punishers should use punishment in scenarios where it is most likely to deter cheating\nPunishment may have a deterrent effect if it reduces the probability that a cheat (or an observer) will\nre-offend in future. There is a subtle but important distinction between special and general deterrence,\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 7\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nthe former being the aim to deter the offender from re-offending and the latter being the aim to deter\nany would-be offender from committing the same crime (Bentham1962; Hoffman2014). Punishment\ncould in principle be consistent with either of these deterrent effects. People often report that the jus-\ntification for punishment decisions is the beneficial deterrent effect (Carlsmithet al.2002; Cushman\n2015; Mathew and Boyd2014), and some empirical work supports the idea that punishment is indeed\nadministered with (special) deterrence in mind. For example, people are more likely to invest in third-\nparty punishment when they believe that the cheat would also harm them (Krasnowet al. 2016). If\nmistreatment of the victim does not predict mistreatment of oneself, then people are less likely to\ninvest in third-party punishment.\nPunishment as a special deterrent predicts that people should be more likely to punish: (i) inten-\ntional harm; (ii) in scenarios where a behaviour change effect is theoretically possible; and (iii) where\nrecidivism is likely. Individuals with nefarious intent should be more likely to be punished because\nthese bad intentions are a reliable indicator that the target is likely to re-offend (although there can\nbe scenarios where harm was not intended but punishment might still deter future offending, for\ninstance, a driver of a speeding car might not intend to hit a pedestrian but can nevertheless be pun-\nished and potentially deterred from speeding in future). Under the deterrence hypothesis, punishment\nshould be preferentially aimed at individuals who can change their behaviour because there is little to\nbe gained from punishing someone who cannot change. Finally, the deterrence hypothesis predicts\nthat the potential for recidivism should be important for similar reasons: there is little to be gained\nfrom punishing someone who is unlikely to re-offend in future. In contrast to these predictions, how-\never, empirical data suggest that, although people are sensitive to intentions when making punishment\ndecisions, they also punish bad outcomes produced from benign intentions (Cushmanet al. 2009;\nMartin and Cushman2016) or from random processes (Houser and Xiao2010). In addition, people\noften punish in scenarios where future cooperation from the target is impossible, for example in one-\nshot settings (Bone and Raihani2015; Fehr and Fischbacher2004; Raihani and McAuliffe2012;T a n\nand Xiao 2018; Walker and Halloran2004), in games where group membership is shuffled between\nrounds such that punishers do not meet targets again (Choi and Ahn 2013; Fehr and Gächter\n2002a), when people know it is the last round of a social interaction (Choi and Ahn2013; Decker\net al. 2003; Engelmann and Nikiforakis 2015; Faillo et al. 2013; Gächter et al. 2008; Ones and\nPutterman 2007) or when punishers themselves terminate the interaction (Barclay and Raihani\n2016). People also punish even when the punishment will not be communicated to the target and can-\nnot therefore deter future cheating (Crockettet al. 2014; Fudenberg and Pathak2010). Punishment\ndecisions are often unrelated to the potential for recidivism: in a study using vignettes to gauge\nwhether putative transgressors ought to be punished, participants paid little attention to the likelihood\nthat the target would re-offend even if punishment was not administered (Darleyet al.2000). Finally,\npunishment as a special deterrent should be sensitive to mitigating circumstances: in contrast, ethno-\ngraphic accounts suggest that even when people have strong extenuating circumstances for defection,\nthey may still be punished for doing so (Mathew and Boyd2014).\nWhile much observed punishment therefore seems inconsistent with the strategic aim of changing\nthe behaviour of targets, it is nevertheless possible that punishment serves as a general deterrent: to\ndeter any potential partner from cheating. Punishment as a general deterrent should be less sensitive\nto the intentions or culpability of the target, so long as observers believe that an intentional crime was\ncommitted (Carlsmith et al. 2002). A model of general deterrence predicts that punishment is only\nadministered when it is visible to others. Some work has found that third-party punishers are sensitive\nto the presence of an audience, being more likely to punish when observed (Kurzbanet al. 2007).\nHowever, in this setup, the interaction was one-shot and so there was no deterrent benefit to be gained\nfrom advertising investments in punishment. In a more recent two-player helping game, where reci-\npients could punish unhelpful donors, people tended to invest more in punishment when their puni-\ntive reputation would be advertised to future partners. Moreover, donors were more likely to cooperate\nwhen playing with a partner with a punitive reputation (dos Santoset al.2013). These findings sup-\nport the idea that punishment can have a general deterrent effect and is administered with this effect in\n8 Nichola J. Raihani and Redouan Bshary\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nmind. To our knowledge, there has been no experimental work exploring whether punishment in\nmultiplayer games is also administered with general deterrence in mind. For instance, in a public\ngoods game, people may punish not just to harm cheats but also to show other group members\nthat cheaters will be punished. To test this, we would need to explore whether investments in punish-\nment in public goods games are sensitive to whether the punishment is communicated to other group\nmembers. It may be important to separate the information about the punishment and the punisher’s\nidentity: people may want others to know that punishment has occurred but not necessarily to be\nidentified as the punisher because this might make the punisher a target for retaliation or potential\neviction from the group (see Rockenbach and Milinski (2011), who found that people paid to hide\nthe fact that they punished other group members in a setting where players could be evicted from\nthe group). Some real-world data on punishment in multiplayer settings has been interpreted in\nterms of general deterrence: in the semi-nomadic Turkana tribe of northern Kenya, age-mates phys-\nically punish a peer who does not participate in or shows cowardice during a battle with the neigh-\nbouring ethnic group (Mathew and Boyd 2011). Such punishment has been interpreted as\nproviding an incentive to men who might otherwise defect to participate in these dangerous battles\n(i.e. a general deterrent effect), but to show this conclusively would require a comparison with a\ncase where no punishment was possible. Moreover, it is possible that there are other personal benefits\nto be gained from participating in raids that might incentivise men to contribute, including the pos-\nsibility to directly increase their own resources, to be chosen as a social partner and to improve their\nsuccess in the mating market (Baumard and Liénard2011). That men stood to directly benefit in their\nparticipation in raids was also supported in follow-on work using vignettes to explore people’s opi-\nnions of free-riders (Mathew and Boyd2014).\nDespite some examples of punishment being consistent with a deterrent aim, some problematic\nfindings remain. For example, the findings listed above– indicating that people punish at the end\nof interactions or when they terminate the interaction– are also inconsistent with a general deterrent\naim, at least if deterrence should operate within the confines of the experimental setting. One could\nargue that people do not bring a psychology for one-shot, anonymous interactions into these experi-\nments (the‘big mistake’ or mismatch hypothesis; Cosmides and Tooby2006) – and that punishment\ncould therefore still be consistent with a general deterrent aim. Nevertheless, several studies find that\npunishment is higher in the last round of an interaction than in preceding rounds (Failloet al. 2013;\nGächter et al. 2008; Guala 2012; Page et al. 2013). While the motivation behind such adjustment is\nunknown, the results show that people do adjust their behaviour to the possibility of future interac-\ntions, although in opposite ways to predictions based on a deterrent function of punishment.\nPrediction 4. Punishers should target defectors, not cooperators or those that did nothing wrong\nIf punishment functions as a tool to promote cooperation, it should be (mostly) aimed at defectors and\nseldom at cooperative individuals. While most empirical evidence suggests that this is the case, in\nmany experimental settings there are non-negligible levels of punishment directed towards people\nwho did nothing wrong (e.g. Abbink and Herrmann2011; Abbink and Sadrieh2009;D a w e set al.\n2007; Paál and Bereczkei2015; Raihani and McAuliffe2012;W u et al. 2009) or towards those who\ncooperated more than the punisher (Anderson and Putterman2006; Cinyabuguma et al. 2006;d e\nMelo and Piaggi2015; Falk et al. 2005; Goette et al. 2012; Herrmann et al. 2008; Irwin and Horne\n2013; Pfattheicheret al.2017; Pleasant and Barclay2018;S y l w e s t e ret al.,2013). In some societies, coop-\nerators are almost or equally as likely to be punished as defectors (Gächteret al. 2010; Gächter and\nHerrmann 2011;H e r r m a n net al. 2008). The tendency to punish cooperators has been found to vary\nacross societies (e.g. Herrmannet al. 2008) and among individuals. For instance, Falket al. (2005)\nfound that, in a prisoner’s dilemma game, cooperative individuals tended to target punishment at defec-\ntors, whereas defectors targeted cooperators and defectors more or less equally. Moreover, in this study,\ncooperators continued to use punishment even when it could not change the payoffs between themselves\nand a partner, whereas defectors did not use punishment under these circumstances.\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 9\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nPrediction 5. Punishers should respond to harmful actions not to payoffs per se\nPunishers who have the strategic aim of deterring cheats should be primarily sensitive to experiencing\nlosses, whereas punishers who have the strategic aim of restoring equality or competing with the part-\nner should be more sensitive to payoff differences between themselves and the target (a psychological\npredisposition that has also been called inequity aversion, Fehr and Schmidt1999). In most social\ndilemmas, interacting with a cheat means that partners incur losses and experience disadvantageous\ninequity (Raihani and McAuliffe2012), meaning that these motives cannot easily be disentangled.\nStudies which have attempted to isolate the proximate basis of punishment decisions in the laboratory\nfound that punishment decisions are at least (or sometimes more) sensitive to inequity than to losses\nand suggest that punishment might often be motivated by disliking being worse off than others, rather\nthan disliking being cheated (Bone and Raihani2015; Carlsmithet al.2002;D a w e set al.2007; Gächter\net al.2017; Houser and Xiao2010; Johnsonet al.2009; Masclet and Villeval2008; Paál and Bereczkei\n2015; Raihani and McAuliffe2012).\nFor example, Raihani and McAuliffe (2012) devised an experiment involving a two-player game\nwhere one player could steal from the other. Importantly, in this game, the victim of theft always\nincurred the same loss but the relative outcomes varied across three conditions where, after stealing,\nthe thief remained at a relative disadvantage, had the same payoffs as the victim or became better off\nthan the victim. This study showed that the primary factor determining whether the victim would\npunish the thief was whether the thief ended up better off: incurring losses in the absence of relative\ndisadvantage did not motivate individuals to punish. Similar findings have been obtained with capu-\nchin monkeys (Leimgruberet al. 2016). In the context of third-party punishment, one recent study\nfound that punishment decisions were better predicted by the envy experienced by the punisher\nthan by any moralistic outrage felt on behalf of the victim (Pedersen et al. 2013; see also\nLeibbrandt and Lopez-Pérez 2012; Paál and Bereczkei 2015). In another recent study that took a\nslightly different approach, Sznycer et al.( 2017) ran a series of questionnaires about wealth\nre-distribution to large-N samples of participants from the US, the UK and India. Around 14– 18%\nof participants stated that they would prefer a tax policy that removed 50% of earnings from the\nwealthiest individuals in society over and above a policy that removed 10% of earnings, but neverthe-\nless produced more money for the poor (because the wealthier people earned more under this policy).\nFinally, other work shows that punishment is used by punishers to create a payoff advantage relative to\ntargets. For example, in Bone and Raihani (2015), people preferred to use punishment to create equal\noutcomes when possible but when equal outcomes were not possible, punishers frequently chose the\nharshest punishment possible, creating the largest asymmetry between their own and target’s payoffs.\nThis is strongly suggestive of a competitive strategic aim (a pattern also reported in Houser and Xiao\n2010).\nMany of the patterns described above (e.g. punishing in the last round of an interaction, punishing\nwhen it cannot be communicated to the target) are more consistent with a competitive strategic aim\nthan with a deterrent aim. Competitive punishment strategies should only be used when punishers can\nchange the payoff differences between themselves and a target: in accordance with this prediction, pre-\nvious studies have reported that antisocial punishment is extremely rare (relative to‘justified’ punish-\nment) when fee-to-fine ratios of 1:1 are used (Boneet al.2015, 2016; Bone and Raihani2015; Egas and\nRiedl 2008; Falket al.2005; Sylwesteret al.2013). Previous work has also indicated that the tendency\nfor antisocial or other competitive punishment strategies is exacerbated under resource scarcity\n(Prediger\net al.2014), and is higher in societies with lower GDP and weaker norms of civic cooperation\n(Herrmann et al. 2008), suggesting that investments in competitive punishment might ultimately\nrelate to ecology and the scale of competition. Competitive punishment strategies might be most likely\nto evolve under resource scarcity because the benefits of harming or eliminating a competitor are\ngreater when resources are scarce (e.g. see Sznyceret al.2017), and in environments where competi-\ntion is relatively local rather than global (see for supporting evidence Barclay and Stoller2014; Barker\nand Barclay 2016).\n10 Nichola J. Raihani and Redouan Bshary\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n3. Brief summary of findings\nThe findings above indicate that: (i) punishers are not always cooperative; (ii) being punished does not\nconsistently have the expected effect of increasing cooperation from the target, or of increasing group\npayoffs; (iii) cooperators as well as defectors can be targeted for punishment; and (iv) punishers are\noften proximately motivated by payoff differences rather than by cheating or losses per se. These find-\nings are problematic from a perspective that views punishment solely as a tool to promote cooperation\nbut are consistent with the hypothesis that punishment serves a competitive function. The fact that\npunishment can be associated with different strategic goals also helps to illuminate how punishers\nare perceived. The aims of general deterrence and a desire to create equal outcomes among all players\n(egalitarianism) are both, broadly speaking, aims that are consistent with producing public goods.\nThus, if people infer that punishment has these collective goals in mind, then they should generally\napprove of punishers. In contrast to this prediction, most published studies indicate that punishers\nare generally disliked and disapproved of (reviewed by Raihani and Bshary2015c), and that punishers\nmight only be approved of in a very restricted range of circumstances where competitive or self-serving\nmotives can be effectively ruled out (see Barclay2006; Jordanet al.2016; Kiyonari and Barclay2008;\nRaihani and Bshary 2015b, c). We suggest that punishers may often be disliked or disapproved of\nbecause punishment is also often consistent with a competitive strategic aim, whereby the punisher\nseeks to increase their own payoffs relative to those of the target.\nThe possibility that punishment can result in immediate fitness benefits to punishers– without the\nneed for any conditional response from targets– somewhat blurs the distinction between punishment\nand what we (and others) had previously labelled‘sanctions’ (interactions where aggressors derive\nimmediate benefits from their actions, also known as negative pseudo-reciprocity; Bergmulleret al.\n2007; Raihani et al. 2012a) or negative indirect reciprocity Bhui et al. 2019). Under negative\npseudo-reciprocity (sanctions), investments in harming another individual can be self-serving even\nif the target does not change his behaviour. For example, female coral gobies have a linear size-based\ndominance hierarchy and may evict any subordinate who grows too close in size to them (Wonget al.\n2007). Previously we argued that this did not fit the definition of punishment, as the evictor gains a\ndirect benefit when she removes a competitor that does not rely on the competitor behaving more\ncooperatively in future interactions with the evictor (Raihaniet al. 2012a). However, it is now apparent\nthat many examples of punishing in humans also have the same property: despite involving a short-\nterm payoff-reduction, punitive strategies can be fitness-enhancing if they change the relative payoffs\nof punishers and their targets. Many ethnographic accounts describe how deviants or cheats risk being\nostracised or deserted by fellow group-members, and there are also many examples of homicidal or\notherwise dangerous individuals being executed by other members of the group (Boehm 2011;\nWrangham 2019). These kinds of harmful acts that also terminate the interaction between cheats\nand victims would involve similar payoff structures as eviction in the goby example above. To account\nfor the variety of potential direct and indirect fitness benefits, we propose that the definition of pun-\nishment should focus on the act itself: an act that lowers the immediate payoff of actor and recipient,\nrather than the circumstances that trigger punishment or the consequences in terms of the target’s\nbehaviour.\n4. Punishment may be rare, but punitive preferences are not\nA competitive account of punishment can potentially help to reconcile the fact that punishment of the\nvariety we study in laboratory settings seems to be relatively rare in the real world, while accounting for\nthe expression of punitive sentiment that is more frequently observed. For instance, ethnographies\nsuggest that a common expression of punitive sentiment occurs in the form of mild criticism or mock-\ning the target (Baumard 2010; Boehm 2011; Wiessner 2005). For example, Hoebel (1954, p. 93)\ndescribed how conflicts among Inuit could be resolved with song-duels, where accused and accuser\ntook it in turns to ridicule one another in verse. Similarly, Ju/’Hoansi bushmen mediate conflict\nand express displeasure with others by using various forms of reputational put-downs, including\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 11\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nmocking, ridicule and outright criticism, rather than physical aggression (Wiessner2005). A parallel\nexample comes from studies of the Cheyenne, where shaming of thieves occurs by a statement to the\neffect of ‘If I had known you wanted that thing, I would have given it to you’ (Hoebel 1954, p. 169).\nNotably, it is not only defectors or cheats who are targeted for shaming and ridicule but also indivi-\nduals who have or seek status or prestige. Indeed, Wiessner (2005) writes that a key function of mock-\ning and ridicule is to‘level big-shot behaviour’. Perhaps because cooperative acts are associated with\nreputational gains for the cooperative individual, ostensive or showy acts of generosity are often hidden\n(Raihani 2014), ignored (Wiessner2005) or even ridiculed (e.g.‘do-gooder derogation’; Minson and\nMonin 2012), findings which also speak to the competitive underbelly of punitive sentiment.\nOther ways that punishers can inflict reputation or status costs on targets is via gossip (Beersma\nand Van Kleef2012; Dunbar2004). Gossip is prevalent in real-world settings and seems to have simi-\nlar payoff structure to punishment in that it is costly to be perceived as a gossip (Adams and Mullen\n2012) and to be gossiped about (Feinberget al. 2012). Gossip typically refers to conversation or state-\nments that convey social information about absent third parties. A disproportionate amount of human\nspeaking time (∼65%, with little variation across cultures, ages or gender; Dunbar2004) is used to\ngossip. Gossip can be used to convey or gather information about interaction partners in the absence\nof direct observation and individuals are sensitive to the potential effects of gossip on their reputation,\nbehaving more cooperatively when reputation is at stake (Feinberget al. 2012, 2014; Jolly and Chang\n2018;W u et al. 2016a, b).\nWhile gossip can in theory transmit either positive or negative information about a target, humans\napparently prefer to gossip negatively (Feinberget al.2014; Peterset al. 2017). Like punishment, nega-\ntive gossip is subjectively rewarding to gossipers and is elicited by the same negative emotions (i.e.\nfrustration and anger at interacting with a cheat) that produce punishment (Feinberget al. 2012).\nAs with punishment, it seems that there is also the potential for gossip to stem from different strategic\naims. For instance, Feinberget al.( 2012) show that tendency to gossip is associated with prosocial\nvalue orientation and people state that the reason for gossip is to help warn the recipient about the\nprevious untrustworthy behaviour of a confederate. However, others have shown that the tendency\nto gossip negatively is predicted by personality traits implicated in antisocial preferences, including\npsychopathy and Machiavellianism (Lyons and Hughes2015). In her study of the Ju/’hoansi bushmen,\nWiessner (2005, 2009) found that∼30% of cases of gossip were‘unfounded and concocted out of jeal-\nousy or social strategies\n’ (P. Wiessner, personal communication). Similarly, empirical work has shown\nthat gossip is most likely to occur in triadic settings, with two people gossiping about a higher-status\nother (Ellwardtet al.2012). As with punishment, it is unlikely that gossip functions to induce cooper-\nation from the target towards the gossiper in the future (i.e. special deterrence), although it might be\nthe case that gossipers are motivated by a more general deterrent aim. One might additionally posit\nthat gossipers, like punishers, are motivated by retributive or competitive aims (i.e. to damage a defec-\ntor’s reputation to increase gossiper’s relative status and improve the gossiper’s relationships with the\naudience, e.g. Bosson et al. 2006; Jolly and Chang2018; Peters et al. 2017). These hypotheses are\namenable to empirical testing.\n6. Institutionalising punishment\nGiven the difficulty in correctly pinpointing why someone punishes, and what their strategic aim\nmight be, it is perhaps unsurprising that we do not typically see participants in experimental games\nresponding to punishment by increasing cooperation. We suggest that the way people respond to pun-\nishment is likely to hinge fundamentally on the motives and aims they attribute to punishers– and\nthat these attributions will hinge crucially on the features of the interaction– broadly speaking,\nwhether the punisher can potentially derive personal benefits from their actions. As far as we\nknow, the link between features and attributions has seldom been explored in empirical studies and\nthus represents a fruitful avenue for inquiry (see Hoet al. 2019 for a first step in this direction).\nThe tendency to infer that punishers are driven by cooperative or competitive motives is expected\n12 Nichola J. Raihani and Redouan Bshary\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nto vary with the context of punishment (specifically whether the context allows that the punisher can\nbenefit from their actions, for example, if punishers expect to interact with targets in future, or can\nimprove their own relative payoffs through the act of punishing– this is discussed at length in\nRaihani and Bshary2015c). The tendency to attribute competitive motives to punishers might also\nvary across individuals. For instance, previous research has shown that there is enormous variation\nin the general population in the tendency to attribute malevolent intentions to others in ambiguous\nsocial settings (Raihani and Bell2017a; Saalfeldet al.2018) and that the tendency to attribute malevo-\nlent intentions to others also predicts punitive responses in social interactions (Raihani and Bell\n2017b). In the standard laboratory setting, where individuals receive punishment in the form of mon-\netary fines without any explanation for the basis of the punishment nor agreement upon the actions\nthat warrant punishment and how severe punishment should be, there is enormous scope for variation\nand error when targets attempt to interpret a punisher’s intentions. For instance, targets might infer\nthat the punisher dislikes interacting with a cheat and wants them to cooperate in the next round.\nHowever, a target of punishment might also reasonably infer that the punisher simply wishes to inflict\nharm rather than to promote cooperation. The intentions attributed to punishers might also vary with\nsocietal norms surrounding the use of punishment. For instance, in societies where individuals expect\nothers to cooperate, punishment might be viewed as a legitimate response to defection, with the\ninferred intention being that punishers seek to change defectors’ behaviour. In societies where such\nnorms do not exist, punishers might be more likely to be perceived as having competitive aims,\nwith the result that punishment is less likely to foster cooperation (see discussion in Balliet and\nVan Lange2013). Empirical work addressing whether intention attribution affects responses to pun-\nishment in economic games would be useful to explore if and how intention attribution affects targets’\nresponses to punishment.\nSuggestive evidence that the perceived intentions of punishers do affect targets’ responses comes\nfrom empirical studies where punishment can be construed as being driven to a greater or lesser extent\nby self-interested motives: in a two-player Trust Game, trustees who demanded a large investment\nfrom the partner under the threat of punishment received less than those who did not issue a punish-\nment threat (Fehr and Rockenbach2003; see also Houseret al.2008). Other work indicates that people\nattempt to infer the proximate motives underpinning punishment decisions and respond accordingly.\nXiao (2013) used a sender– receiver game, where the sender could benefit by deceiving the receiver,\nand introduced a punishment stage where the receiver could additionally punish the sender. In some\ntreatments, receivers immediately benefitted from punishing the partner, whereas in others punishment\nwas associated with a payoff reduction. When receivers could benefit from punishing the sender, third-\nparty bystanders were less likely to infer that the sender had cheated, compared with cases where recei-\nvers could not benefit from punishing the sender (Xiao2013). Similarly, a meta-analysis finds that deci-\nsions to reduce someone else’s payoffs are more likely to promote cooperation when these payoff\nreductions are costly to the actor, rather than free, to implement (Ballietet al.2011).\nGenerally, we predict that the tendency to cooperate in response to punishment will be inversely\nrelated to the extent to which targets of punishment can infer that the punisher has competitive\naims. Cooperating or acquiescing in response to competitive punishment can be construed as capitu-\nlating in response to aggression from an evenly matched peer (as punishment is typically operationa-\nlised in experimental economic games). Instead, under natural conditions, there might be selection\nagainst targets allowing themselves to be subordinated, and individuals might attempt to preserve\ntheir status by retaliating against evenly matched aggressors (see Boehm2011). Indeed, the rejection\nof unfair Ultimatum Game offers has been interpreted as a means of avoiding acquiring a subordinate\nstatus (Yamagishiet al.2012) and punishment is also linked to testosterone levels in men (Burnham\n2007), as would be expected if punishment is viewed as a dominance competition rather than as a way\nto communicate cooperative norms. Selection against subordination could be stronger if capitulating\nto aggressors is also observed by others. In much the same way as gaining a punitive reputation can\nyield an advantage to punishers (Barclay2006; dos Santoset al. 2011, 2013; dos Santos and Wedekind\n2015; Raihani and Bshary 2015b, c), a reputation for being easily subordinated might be\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 13\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ndisadvantageous to acquire (see Cohenet al.1996; Crombaget al. 2003; Osgood2017). This hypoth-\nesis deserves further theoretical and empirical attention.\nThe possibility for punishment to spark retaliation, rather than cooperation, is prevalent in histor-\nical (Barrettet al.2005) and ethnographic records (Boehm2011; Hoebel1954; McCulloughet al.2013;\nWiessner 2005; see Jacksonet al.2019 for a recent review). Indeed, many societies seem to have inde-\npendently converged on customs (e.g. duels and other ritualised contests) that circumscribe the con-\ntexts in which punishment can be administered, perhaps to limit these detrimental consequences\n(Boehm 2011). As a consequence, decentralised peer punishment of the variety studied in experimen-\ntal economic games is often rare or absent among humans in the real world (Guala2012; Pedersen\net al. 2018; Wiessner 2005), although it tends to be more common in contexts where such customs\nare lacking (reviewed in Jacksonet al. 2019). These findings speak to a more specific insight, which\nis that for punishment to be effective as a tool to convert cheaters into co-operators, it must be per-\nceived as legitimate (Baldassarri and Grossman2011; Bowles and Gintis2013; Ertanet al. 2009; Faillo\net al. 2013;G r o s set al. 2016; Tyler 2006; Villatoro et al. 2014; Xiao and Tan2014; Zheng and Nie\n2013). Here, we define legitimisation as any process, mechanism or institution that reduces the\nscope for punishment to be driven by competitive aims and thereby increases the probability that tar-\ngets cooperate in response to punishment.\nPerhaps the simplest legitimising mechanism is communication: allowing people to explain to tar-\ngets why they are punishing means that cooperation is more likely to ensue (Janssenet al. 2010).\nLegitimacy can also be promoted by more formalised agreements or customs, which are often collect-\nively referred to as institutions (Cushman2015; Hurwicz 1996; North 1990; Powers et al. 2016).\nSpecifically, institutions can be thought of as political game forms which change the payoffs associated\nwith social interactions (Hurwicz1996; Powerset al. 2016). Institutions probably play a vital role in\nchanging the game form of punishment from one where individuals can benefit by harming others,\nregardless of how the target behaves (i.e. as is the case with competitive punishment) to one where\nit only pays to punish cooperative norm violators (Boyd2017). In much the same way, it has been\nposited that institutions played (and continue to play) a vital role in transforming social dilemmas\n(where the strategic incentive is to defect) into games where the individually self-interested strategy\nis to cooperate (Boyd2017; Powers et al. 2016; Sigmund et al. 2010). Although institutions might\nthus generate benefits for all members of a group, we also note that the historical record contains\nmany examples of institutions being used to further the interests of a powerful few at the expense\nof the many (Acemoglu2006; Acemoglu et al. 2001; Briggs et al. 2005).\nCrucially, institutions have often been omitted from standard experimental economic investigations\nof peer punishment, which might help to explain the relatively mixed results on the efficacy of peer\npunishment in these stylised settings. One way to legitimise punitive acts is for participants to self-\nselect into groups with punishment regimes (see Gürerket al. 2006 for experimental evidence and\nFrey and Sumner2019 for a real-world example), to vote for sanctioning institutions (Sutteret al.\n2010) or to be involved in shaping institutions that dictate how punishment will be implemented\n(Decker et al. 2003; Ertan eta l. 2009). Recent experimental work indicates that the requirement for\nconsensus is an important institution for legitimising punishment: when punishment decisions are\nreached by consensus, punishment is more effective at promoting cooperation (Cardenas 2000;\nCasari and Luini2009; Eriksson et al. 2017; Ertan et al. 2009; Hilbe et al. 2014; Pfattheicher et al.\n2018; Shinada and Yamagishi2007; Villatoroet al.2014; Zheng and Nie2013). Many laboratory stud-\nies reporting positive effects of punishment on targets’ subsequent behaviour (e.g. Fehr and Gächter\n2000, 2002a; Pfattheicheret al. 2018; Rockenbach and Milinski2006; Shinada and Yamagishi2007)d o\nnot report how many people independently punished a cheating player, meaning that it is unclear to\nwhat extent any positive effects of punishment on the target’s subsequent cooperation were driven by\nthese seemingly consensus-based cases in which two or three peers decided independently to punish\nthe same target.\nData from real-world settings also support the idea that consensus-based legitimacy can increase\nthe efficacy of punishment. For example, Mathew and Boyd (2011) argue that punishment is only\n14 Nichola J. Raihani and Redouan Bshary\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nadministered after a consensus-making process, noting that‘vigilante’ punishment that is administered\nwithout prior consensus is disapproved of. Similar historical examples also exist. In medieval England,\nmen were organised into small groups called‘tithings’ who were responsible for administering pun-\nishment to any defector in their group. Interestingly, these real-world examples show that participa-\ntion in group punishment is often (i) forced rather than voluntary and (ii) administered by the allies or\nkin of the target (Hoebel1954, p. 89). Both features might mean that there is less scope for targets to\ninfer that punishers are motivated by competitive aims and/or benefit via enhancing their own relative\npayoffs in such interactions (see also Boehm2011 for ethnographic examples). Moreover, consensual\npunishment administered by group might reduce the scope for retaliation (and feuds) simply by virtue\nof the cost associated with retaliating against a larger group. Legitimacy is also helped by restricting\nwho can punish: when people can only punish those who contribute less than them (Failloet al.\n2013; Grieco et al. 2017), it reduces the possibility that punishment is perceived as a competitive\naction.\nOutsourcing punishment to authorities (also called‘centralising’ punishment) might be another\nway to increase legitimacy. When given the choice, people prefer to pay taxes to provide centralised\n‘pool’ punishment rather than peer punishment (Andreoni and Gee 2012; Traulsen et al. 2012),\nalthough other work finds that, when given the choice between a punishment or no punishment\nregime, many people at least initially opt for the latter (Guillenet al. 2007; Gürerk et al. 2006).\nMoreover, when a centralised punishment mechanism is available, people reduce their investments\nin peer punishment, leading to overall higher average payoffs (mainly because people are not paying\nfor peer punishment and retaliation is reduced in the centralised punishment regime; Andreoni and\nGee 2012). Nevertheless, evidence that centralised punishment is more effective than peer (decentra-\nlised) punishment is mixed (Andreoni and Gee2012; Baldassarri and Grossman2011; Carpenteret al.\n2012; Griecoet al.2017; Nosenzo and Sefton2014;O ’Gorman et al.2009; Traulsenet al.2012), with a\nmeta-analysis indicating that centralised punishment is actually less effective than decentralised pun-\nishment at promoting cooperation (Ballietet al. 2011). We predict that the perceived legitimacy of the\nauthority will be crucial for determining whether the punishment they deliver is effective, and thus\nincreases group welfare. For example, an experiment in Uganda found that participants were more\nthan twice as likely to increase cooperation in response to punishment from an elected monitor\nthan in response to punishment from a monitor who was randomly assigned to the role\n(Baldassarri and Grossman2011). Often, individuals with the power to wield punishment are either\nelected to that role on the basis of their character and can be demoted if they are perceived to be cor-\nrupt (Lierl 2018) or are held in check by a variety of mechanisms (institutions) that preclude or\nstrongly disincentivise corrupt leadership methods (Bøggild and Petersen2016).\nWe also predict that centralised punishment will be more effective where there is little potential for\nauthorities to obtain personal benefits from their punitive acts. Sometimes, authorities can benefit\nfrom the punishments that are administered– for example, Hoebel (1954) describes how Inuit sha-\nmans acting as authorities in disputes involving women would often instruct the woman to have inter-\ncourse with him (his powers being conveniently able to counteract the effects of her sinning).\nSimilarly, in many small-scale societies, monitoring is incentivised by allowing individuals who detect\ncrimes to keep a portion of any fine that is levied on a cheat (Ostrom2015). In the Ifugao of Luzon,\npeople known as monkalum act as informal go-betweens in disputes and conflicts, and benefit in this\nquasi-judiciary role from taking fees from defendants (Hoebel1954, p. 116). In such situations, we\nexpect that even punishment from authorities will be scarcely better than conventional peer punish-\nment in promoting cooperation. Punishment is more likely to have a cooperation-enforcing effect\nwhen authorities are perceived to be impartial (Muthukrishnaet al.2017). Indeed, a recent experiment\nconducted in Liberia found that punishment from leaders only promoted cooperation when leaders\nreceived a flat fee for the role of punisher, rather than benefitting from administering the punishment\nitself (Beekmanet al.2018). Similarly, experimental evidence from real-world leaders of a forest com-\nmons management programme in Ethiopia revealed that: (i) leaders varied in their propensity to pun-\nish indiscriminately (i.e. competitively) in an experimental setting; and (ii) competitive leaders were\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 15\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nless effective at promoting collective cooperation in the context of the forest management (Kosfeld and\nRustagi 2015). Procedural fairness thus seems to be an important device for increasing legitimacy\n(Bøggild and Petersen2016; Cremer and van Knippenberg2003; Eisner et al. 2017).\n7. Moving forwards\nWe believe that new theoretical and empirical studies are now needed to examine the conditions under\nwhich punishment with different strategic aims outlined above (Table 1) could be favoured by selec-\ntion. In this endeavour, we suggest that identifying the relevant ecological and social factors that affect\nthe use and efficacy of punishment will be crucial. These factors are likely to include (but are not lim-\nited to) population structure, resource availability, the likelihood of repeated interactions, the scale of\ncompetition and the strength and content of the institutions surrounding the acceptable use of pun-\nishment. We predict that competitive punishment should be increasingly favoured by selection as the\nscale of competition becomes increasingly local, although we also believe that more work is currently\nneeded on how ecology (resource availability, population structure, pathogen prevalence, environmen-\ntal predictability, etc.) affects the scale of competition and the form and content of institutions across\nsocieties. Ideally, theoretical models would also start to explore the evolutionarily stable responses to\npunishers (as in Hilbe and Traulsen2012; Morris et al. 2017). For example, it would be helpful to\nknow under what conditions cooperating in response to punishment might be under negative selection\n(readily submitting to peers might be under negative selection when observed by others, for example).\nIn empirical studies, we believe it is important that punishment is implemented using various cost\nratios (e.g. as in Bone and Raihani2015; Boneet al.2015, 2016; Egas and Riedl2008; Nikiforakis and\nNormann 2008; Sefton et al. 2007). We are not aware of any biological rationale for the commonly\nimplemented 1:3 fee-to-fine ratio. In fact, giving each person in a dilemma this same technology\nmakes little biological sense. A 1:3 ratio implies a dominance hierarchy or a power asymmetry (it\ncosts me a small amount to inflict a larger cost on you): it is not obvious how an individual can be\nboth a dominant and a subordinate in such a power struggle. More generally, we also note that the\nstandard 1:3 fee-to-fine ratio has the competitive function inbuilt by default. While some authors\nhave argued that low-cost, high-impact punishment is necessary to promote cooperation\n(Chaudhuri 2011; Nikiforakis and Normann 2008; but see Balliet et al. 2011), it is also possible\nthat these competitive fee-to-fine ratios are more likely to prompt retaliation, thereby undermining\ncooperation. We suggest that work exploring punishment that is more costly to administer than it is\nto receive might be more likely to be interpreted as an honest signal of discontent (rather than as an\nexpression of competitive motives) and might thus be more likely to induce targets to cooperate (see\nBalliet et al.2011 for evidence on the importance of punishment costs for promoting cooperation).\nAn underexplored line of research is to compare punishment in humans explicitly with that in\nother species. Few studies have adapted typical human laboratory games to test for punishment deci-\nsions in primates (Jensen et al. 2007a, b; Leimgruber et al. 2016), and even rarer are studies that\nexplore to what extent punishment may stabilise human cooperation under conditions in which pun-\nishment stabilises cooperation in other species (but see Boneet al.2016). One important theme in the\ncleaner fish mutualism seems to be asymmetries. Among cleaners and their clients, there are clear\nasymmetries in strategic options owing to pre-determined roles: the cleaners are service providers\nthat can cheat while the clients are what the name implies, lacking options to cheat in return (unless\nthey are predators and hence could eat the cleaner; Trivers1971). In the case of male cleaners punish-\ning cheating female partners, there are asymmetries in power among interacting players as male clea-\nners are larger than and dominant to female partners. Indeed, females never punish males for cheating\na shared client. In the vervet monkey example, punishment seems to be used as a form of negotiation\nover what actions to take, as females have more to gain than males from escalating and attacking the\nneighbouring group. Thus, it appears that intergroup encounters are not about cooperating and free-\nriding but about diverging interests between the sexes. Capturing key features of these animal\n16 Nichola J. Raihani and Redouan Bshary\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2019.12 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nexamples in new laboratory-based experiments may yield important insights about punishment in\nhumans, no matter whether results will be similar or different from the animal cases (Boneet al.2016).\nWe also need more studies which tease out possible motives underpinning punishment decisions\nand responses to punishment. For example, if punishment serves a competitive function, then helpful\nindividuals who reap disproportionate payoffs from their actions should be more likely to be punished\nthan unhelpful individuals who nevertheless remain at a relative disadvantage– and individuals might\ntherefore avoid any actions (not just cheating) that leave them at a payoff advantage over partners in\nsocial interactions.\nTo conclude, we suggest that human punishment might sometimes or by some persons be aimed at\nchanging the behaviour of targets but that this is not always the case– and that competitive motives\nare understudied and yet arguably more important. There is more evidence to suggest that the possi-\nbility of punishment acts as an antecedent deterrent against would-be cheats than as a tool to convert\ncheats into cooperators– but this could be an exaptation, with the primary function of punishment\nbeing to reduce personal payoff disadvantages or improve punisher’s own payoffs relative to the tar-\nget’s. Certainly, the existing empirical evidence on the proximate motives underpinning punishment\ndecisions suggests that punishment decisions frequently stem from fairness and/or status concerns,\nrather than from the desire to reciprocate harm. Researchers interested in the role of punishment\nin supporting human cooperation– including us!– need to start thinking hard about additional pos-\nsible functions of punishment in humans.\nAcknowledgements.
