Moskowitz \nInformation Technology Division---5580 \n Naval Research Laboratory \nWashington, DC 20375 \nsimon.t.kapiamba.civ@us.navy.mil, hesham.y.fouad.civ@us.navy.mil, ira.s.moskowitz.civ@us.navy.mil   \n \n \n \nAbstract \nThis paper outlines an approach for assessing and quantifying \nthe risks associated with integrating Large Language Models \n(LLMs) in generating naval operational plans. It aims to ex-\nplore the potential benefits and challenges of LLMs in this \ncontext and to suggest a methodology for a comprehensive \nrisk assessment framework. \nBackground    \nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial in-\ntelligence systems trained on vast datasets to process and \ngenerate text, enabling them to perform tasks ranging from \nsimple question answering to complex content creation. \nLLMs, such as ChatGPT and Bard, have shown remarkable \ncapabilities in understanding, interpreting, and generating \nhuman language. Their potential use in naval operations \ncould offer significant strategic advantages, such as en-\nhanced decision support, scenario analysis, and operational \nplanning efficiency. However, the deployment of these ad-\nvanced AI technologies in sensitive military contexts raises \ncritical questions about risks, including potential biases, op-\nerational security concerns, and the reliability of AI-gener-\nated strategies. \n The significance of this research lies in its focus on the \nintegration of LLMs in naval operational plan generation. \nBy examining the potential risks and developing a frame-\nwork for the assessment of these risks, this research aims to \ncontribute to the safe and strategic use of AI technologies in \nthese naval operational contexts, while keeping technologi-\ncal advancements aligned with operational safety and effec-\ntiveness. \n A review of the existing literature reveals a gap in com-\nprehensive risk assessment frameworks specifically tailored \nfor LLMs in military applications. Studies on LLMs have \n \nCopyright © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial \nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

However, the unique challenges \nof military operations, particularly in naval environments, \nnecessitate a specialized approach to risk assessment. This \nresearch seeks to bridge this gap by developing a methodol-\nogy grounded in the specific requirements and complexities \nof naval operational planning. \nMethodology \nThe theoretical framework for this research is based on \nBayesian networks, which offer a structured approach to \nmodeling the complex relationships between various risk \nfactors associated with LLM deployment. Bayesian net-\nworks are particularly suited for this purpose due to their \nability to handle uncertainty and probabilistic relationships, \nmaking them ideal for assessing the multifaceted risks of \nLLM integration in naval operations. \n Incorporating insights from the methodology outlined by \nLauría and Duchessi (2007), this research adopts a similar \nstructured approach to constructing Bayesian networks \nrooted in empirical data collection and analysis. Our meth-\nodology begins with the development and administration of \na questionnaire whose responses will serve as the initial data \nsource for identifying the most probable relationships be-\ntween variables related to naval operational plan risks. This \nprocess sets up the subsequent parameterization of the con-\nditional distributions for each node within our Bayesian net-\nwork. Through this approach, we aim to build a robust \nBayesian network model that accurately reflects the com-\nplex interdependencies and probabilistic nature of risks as-\nsociated with LLM generated operational plans, further re-\nfining our model as we analyze more operational plans and \nintegrate additional empirical data. \n \n \nAAAI Spring Symposium Series (SSS-24)\n50\n \nThe methodology for this research involves several key \nsteps: \n• Questionnaire Development and Administration \n• Data Collection and Analysis \n• Bayesian Network Modeling \n• Risk Categorization and Assessment \n \nQuestionnaire Development and Administration \nA detailed questionnaire will be designed to gather infor-\nmation from a wide range of stakeholders, such as naval per-\nsonnel, AI experts, and military strategists. The question-\nnaire will contain a wide variety of naval operational plans, \nsome LLM generated and some by operational planners, to \nidentify potential avenues of risk in these plans. \nData Collection and Analysis \nResponses from the questionnaire will be collected and an-\nalyzed to identify concern areas on naval operational plans. \nThis analysis will form the basis for identifying key risk fac-\ntors associated with operational plans along with those spe-\ncific to LLM generated plans. \nBayesian Network Modeling \nThe identified risk factors will be modeled using Bayesian \nnetworks to understand their interdependencies and the \nprobabilistic nature of these risks. This model will serve as \na dynamic tool for assessing and visualizing the complex \nrisk landscape of these generated operational plans. \nRisk Categorization and Assessment \nRisks identified through the questionnaire and Bayesian net-\nwork model will be categorized and assessed in terms of \ntheir potential impact on naval operations. This step in-\nvolves a thorough evaluation of each risk factor, considering \nboth its likelihood and severity. \nAnalysis \nThe analysis phase of the research will involve a compara-\ntive study of hypothetical plans generated by LLMs and \nthose created by human strategists. This comparison aims to \nhighlight the strengths, limitations, and potential risks asso-\nciated with LLM-generated plans. Additionally, the research \nwill explore strategies for mitigating identified risks, such \nas incorporating checks and balances, enhancing transpar-\nency, and ensuring the continuous validation of LLM out-\nputs. \n The research is expected to yield several key outcomes: \n • A comprehensive list of risk factors associated with the \nuse of LLMs in naval operational planning, derived from \nstakeholder feedback and Bayesian network analysis. \n • A structured framework for assessing the identified \nrisks, providing a basis for decision-makers to evaluate \nand mitigate potential challenges in integrating LLMs \ninto operational planning. \n • Findings from the comparative analysis of LLM-gen-\nerated and human-created plans, offering valuable in-\nsights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in op-\nerational planning contexts. \n • Recommendations for mitigating the identified risks, \nensuring that the integration of LLMs into actual opera-\ntions is conducted in a manner that     maximizes benefits \nwhile minimizing potential drawbacks. \nPreliminary Results \nHere we have used ChatGPT to generate a sample fictional \noperational plan based on the following commander’s in-\ntent: “ My intent is to support the Armed Forces of the \nPhilippines in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster \nResponse (HA/DR) operations in the affected areas of \nthe Central Philippines. We will provide all available as-\nsistance to alleviate human suffering and restore nor-\nmalcy” (Fig 1). \n \nThe LLM-generated operational plan for fictional HA/DR \noperations in the Central Philippines showcases the model's \ncapability to structure a comprehensive response strategy. \nHowever, it also highlights several potential risks associated \nwith LLM-generated plans. \n The plan outlines setting up a forward-operating base on \nPanay Island without considering the island's current capac-\nity to support such operations or the potential impact on lo-\ncal communities. This oversight could strain local resources \nor disrupt ongoing recovery efforts by local authorities. \n The use of drones for immediate aerial surveys assumes \nthat areas most in need can be quickly and accurately iden-\ntified. However, this approach may not account for rapidly \nchanging weather conditions or new emergencies arising \npost-assessment, potentially leading to misallocation of re-\nsources. \n The reliance on naval helicopters for air drops in areas \ninaccessible by road could be problematic if there are un-\nforeseen technical issues or if the helicopters are needed \nsimultaneously for multiple urgent tasks. This highlights a \npotential overreliance on specific assets without considering \nalternative or backup methods for delivery. \n The recovery phase suggests assisting in the restoration \nof critical infrastructure without detailing the scope of in-\nvolvement or the criteria for beginning the withdrawal of \nnaval assets. This lack of specificity could lead to premature \nwithdrawal or extended engagements beyond the naval op-\neration's capacity, affecting the overall effectiveness of the \nrecovery efforts.  \n51\n \nFigure 1: ChatGPT generated operational plan \n The examination of this LLM-generated operational plan \nnot only illustrates the potential of AI in enhancing opera-\ntional planning capabilities but also makes evident the ne-\ncessity of our research effort in developing comprehensive  \nrisk models for LLM-generated naval operational plans. \nIdentifying specific risk factors inherent in the AI's ap-\nproach—such as assumptions about local infrastructure ca-\npacity, reliance on technology, and vagueness in the plan's  \nexecution and completion criteria—demonstrates the need \nfor a framework that can evaluate these risks effectively so \nthat they can be accounted for when these tools are used. \nOur research aims to address these gaps by using methodol-\nogies to assess, categorize, and manage the risks associated \nwith deploying LLMs in complex operational environments. \nBy integrating these risk models, we can better ensure that \nthe innovative capabilities of LLMs are leveraged responsi-\nbly, enhancing the effectiveness and reliability of opera-\ntional planning. \n Palantir AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) is a cutting-\nedge approach to integrating artificial intelligence systems, \nincluding many capabilities that rely on LLMs, into opera-\ntional environments. While leveraging these advanced tools \nallows organizations to harness the massive capabilities of \nAI systems, the use of LLMs in platforms such as Palantir \nAIP makes clear the critical need for comprehensive re-\nsearch into all of the potential associated risk factors. As \nthese AI-driven systems are deployed to assist with and au-\ntomate more and more significant aspects of operational \nplanning, the particular nuances of AI-generated content be-\ncome important areas of concern.  \n Looking forward to the deployment of LLMs in naval op-\nerations exposes another avenue of risk, particularly in \nterms of the infrastructure required to support such technol-\nogies. The heavy computational and data transmission de-\nmands of LLMs, along with the need for real-time data pro-\ncessing and seamless communication for executing AI-\ndriven operational plans, require a network infrastructure \nthat is not only resilient but also highly adaptable. This is \nwhere the potential integration of Software Defined Net-\nworks (SDNs) becomes relevant. SDNs, known for their \nagility and configurability, represent an advanced network-\ning framework that could potentially support the require-\nments of LLM deployments. However, the introduction of \nSDNs also brings forth questions regarding the readiness of \nexisting naval network infrastructures to adapt to such ad-\nvanced technologies, highlighting another area for consider-\nation as we advance towards incorporating AI capabilities in \nnaval operations. \n The anticipated findings of this research have significant \nimplications for the future of naval operations from the stra-\ntegic integration of LLMs. By providing a comprehensive \nrisk assessment framework, this research aims to facilitate \ninformed decision-making and responsible use of AI tech-\nnologies in naval operations to seed the ground work for its \nresponsible use in wider military contexts. Moreover, the re-\nsearch addresses critical gaps in the literature, contributing \nto a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportuni-\nties presented by LLM integration in naval operations. \n This research outlines a comprehensive approach to as-\nsessing the risks associated with integrating LLMs into na-\nval operational planning. By developing a structured risk as-\nsessment framework and exploring the potential benefits \nand challenges of LLM deployment, this research aims to \ncontribute to the responsible and effective use of AI tech-\nnologies in military operations. Future research directions \ninclude the refinement of the risk assessment framework \nbased on empirical findings, the exploration of additional \napplications of LLMs in wider military contexts, and the de-\nvelopment of guidelines for the ethical use of AI in sensitive \noperational environments. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe thank Bill Lawless for his assistance and guidance with \nthis paper. \n52\n \nReferences  \nDu, Y., Li, S., Torralba, A., Tenenbaum, J.B. and Mordatch, \nI., 2023.
