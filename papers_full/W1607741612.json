The establishment o f \nmaintenance programs which signal abnormal conditions in transformers, is essential for the reliable \noperation of these equipments.  However, in a competitive market, it is important to maximize investments \nby depleting the remaining life of the equipments before replacing them.  \nThe end of life of a transformer comes about by aging of its solid insulation which is mainly Kraft paper, \npressboard and wood and these materials age mainly by hydrolysis reactions.  Although transformer  life -\ntime is considered to be about 30 years, experience shows that some transformers remain in service for \nmore than 50 years [1]. Aging of cellulosic insulation depends mainly on operating temperature, moisture , \noxygen and acids.  The value of these factors depends on the operating conditions and maintenance \npractices which are not always accurately quantified.  Having a method to estimate the remaining life of a \ntransformer is essential for owners to assess the risk of keeping a transformer in service, or the necessity of \nreplacing it.  \nUnfortunately, estimating the remaining life of transformer insulation is not an easy task as it is not \npossible to extract paper samples from the active part of the transformer to make direct determinations and \nestimations are always based on indirect estimations. On the other hand , the transformer temperature is not \nhomogeneous so the condition of the paper varies within the transformer which makes the analysis even \nmore complex.   \nThe determination of the furanic compounds content in the transformer oil is one of the more valuable \nmethods to diagnose the aging condition of transformer solid insulation [2]. Unlike other markers, for \nexample CO or CO 2, which are produced during the degradation of cellu losic insulation but also mineral \nThis article presents a statistical study devoted to obtain the reference values of 2FAL in power \ntransformers.  \noil, furanic compounds are exclusively generated as a byproduct of the aging reactions of only cellulose \ninsulation, and that makes the diagnosis more reliable.  \nThe furanic content of oils has been studied for years and some theoretical models have been proposed to \nestimate the polymerization degree of paper from the furanic content [3]-[5]. However, the analysis and the \ninterpretation of the results is not so clear and that more work is necessary to make it a more useful method.  \nIEEE C57.104 and IEC 60599 standards  provide interpretation methods and reference values for \ndissolved gas in oil but these standards do not include recommendations for the interpretation of the res ults \nof furanic compounds.  Recently, CIGRE WG D1.01.13 published “Furanic Compounds for Diagnosis” \n[6], in which some of the difficulties of the method are identified and recommendations are given to \nimprove its potential use. The necessity of creating da tabases with typical values for different transformer \npopulations was identified as one of the main goals in this field.  \nThe Spanish company CEIS (Centro de Ensayos Innovacion y Servicios)  has an accredited laboratory \nwith more than 30 years of experience  in testing dielectric materials and mainly electro -technical fluids. \nThe experience of the laboratory in testing and helping to evaluate the results for the utilities of the Spanish \nelectrical market has generated an important database with more than 28,000 registrants.  \nThis article reports on the statistical values of furanic compounds dis solved in transformer oil. The 90th \n(alert), 95th and 98th (alarm) percentiles of 5Hydroxymethyl -2Furfural (5HMF), 2Furfuraldehyde (2FAL), \n2Acetylfuran (2ACF), and 5Met yl-2Furfural (5MEF) are calculated. As the presence and concentration of \nthe compounds depends not only on the condition of the transformer, but also on its characteristics, the \npercentile values of the main furanic compound, 2FAL, are calculated for different transformer \npopulations.  The transformers in the database are divided according to their characteristics, and the \npercentiles are recalculated for the different groups determining the influence of the transformer \ncharacteristics in the 2FAL content in oil. All the criteria recommended by CIGRE  WG D1.01.13 are \nconsidered in the analysis: age, voltage and power rating, cooling system, tra nsformer type and reasons for \nthe  analysis. Additionally, the typical growing rates of 2FAL are calculated for the whole database and for \ndifferent populations classified according to transformer age.   \nPercentile values of the furanic compounds of the database \nThe database used in this study contains 28,597 records of oil analysis. These records were taken from \n1993 to 2013, on 8,275 transformers , mainly free breathing type, from more than 100 companies , from \ngeneration, transmission, distribution of elec trical power, and from industries, which also included many \nmanufacturers of transformers.   \nSome of the records which did not include the analysis of furanic compounds were discarded, leaving \n18,280 records for analysis, and all of which included values of the furanic compounds in oil and other \nmarkers, such as dissolved gasses and complete physic-chemical analysis. Additional information about the \ntransformers, such as their rated power, voltage, age, cooling system is also included in the database.  \nAll the furanic compound determinations were performed in the same laboratory according to IEC \n61198. The concentration of the four most important compounds: 5HMF, 2FAL, 2ACF, and 5MEF, was \nmeasured to one part per million.  \nInitially, the values of the 90th, 95th and 98th percentile of 5HMF, 2FAL, 2ACF, and 5MEF were \nobtained. Table I and Figure 1 shows 2FAL as the furanic compound with the highest concentration. It can \nbe seen that the concentrations of the other furanic compounds in most transformers are almost nil.  \nCIGRE WG D1.01.13 also shows the percentile values of 2FAL on a database of 30,000 records from 12 \ninternational laboratories and companies across North and South America, Europe and Asia [5]. The \ncomparison between the values calculated in this work and those proposed by CIGRE [5] , shown in Figure \n2, are within the same ranges, although the difference in the value of the 98 percentile differs. \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

It should be noted that in Spain , most transformers are of the free breathing type, and the \nuse of thermally upgraded paper is not universal, which may have an influence in the typical furanic \ncompound levels. \nCIGRE has indicated that “a universal value for establishing normal levels for 2FAL should not be \nutilized” and has proposed “to subdivide the databases into subsets which represent similar equipment with \n0.00\n0.50\n1.00\n1.50\n2.00\n2.50\n3.00\n3.50\n4.00\n4.50\n5HMF 2FAL 2ACF 5MEF \nFurane content (ppm)\nperc 90\nperc 95\nperc98\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\nPerc 90 Perc 95 Perc 98\nConcentration of 2 FAL (ppm)\nProposed\nCigré WG D1.01\nregard to 2FAL generation and materials”.  WG D1.01.13 was not able to perform such subdivision \nbecause of the lack of information in the available records.  \nThis task has been accomplished in the present work, using the database generated by CEIS, with 18,280 \nrecords. The study is focused in the study of 2FAL which is the most abundant compound and the most \nsuitable for diagnostic purposes.  \nDetermination of the percentile values of 2FAL for different populations  \nTypical values of the furans-in-oil content depend on the transformer characteristics and on the operation \nmode.  Therefore , the statistical evaluation of the data must be done considering different populations of \ntransformers to obtain reliable reference values [5]. CIGRE WG D1.01.13 attempted to obtain typical \nvalues for different transformer populations taking into account the following factors: \n• Type of transformer \n• Type of oil \n• Type of oil-preservation system \n• Type of cooling system \nAdditionally, other factors that may have a major influence on the aging of the cellulose are considered: \n• Thermal aspects  \n• Aging acceleration agents in contact with the cellulose (e.g moisture and oxygen) \n• Design characteristics  \n• Oil processing  \n• Type of paper used to insulate the transformers \nFinally, the working group document points out that it is important to consider the motive of the analysis, \ndividing the data into routine analysis of transformers from data from transformers suspect of abnormal \ncondition.  \nUnfortunately, the task could not be accomplished by WG D1.01.13, as not enough information was \nincluded in the records to do the classification [5].  \nIn this work a percentile study has been done splitting the availa ble database of 18,280 records into \ndifferent categories:  \n• Transformer age \n• Rated power \n• Rated voltage \n• Transformer application  \n• Cooling mode  \n• Motive of the analysis \nTo state the validity of the proposed reference values, t wo important aspects of the Spanish transformer \npopulation should be highlighted:  \nAbout 98% of the transformers included in the database are of the free breathing type, since it is the \ncommon system used in Spain; \nAll the transformers included in the stud y are insulated with non-upgraded Kraft paper and non-inhibited \nmineral oil.  \n \nClassification by transformer age \nFive age intervals were considered in this study. The numbers of records available for each category are \nshown in Table 2. It is interesting to note that the data are almost homogenously distributed within the \ndifferent age ranges between 0 and 30 years. It should also be noted that 25% of the records in the database \ncorrespond to transformers older than 30 years.   \nThe percentiles 90th, 95th and 98th of 2FAL obtained for each age range are shown in Table 2 and Fig 3. \nAs can be seen, the percentiles increase sharply as the age rises.  \n \nTable 2.

CIGRE WG D1.01.13 recommends calculating the 2FAL typical values for the various \ntransformer cooling systems.  The database was divided into categories according to the cooling mode of \nthe transformers. The number of records of each category is shown in Table 3. \n \nTable 3.

As the cooling \nsystem is more efficient , the furanic content is lower. So ONAN cooled transformers, has the greater \nfuranic content.

Percentiles 90th, 95th  and 98th  of 2FAL as a function of transformer rated power and voltage.    \n \nIt is evident that 2FAL typical values are greater for transformers with lower power and voltage ratings, \nthe higher values are found on transformers with rated power lower than 25 MVA and rated voltage lower \nthan 66 kV. To understand these results, an additional study was c arried out splitting the database into \ncategories according power rating and age. These results are shown in Table 6.  \nThe results obtained for the younger transformers (population 0 -10 years) show the influence of the \npaper-oil ratio of the transformers, as large power transformers have a lower paper/oil ratio than small \ntransformers [7]. It should be also highlighted here , that the cooling system of a transformer is related with \nits rated power and thus transformers with a power rating lower than 40 MVA are mainly ONAN \ntransformers. So the high typical values of 2FAL percentiles of low power transformers and that of ONAN \ntransformers are not independent events.  \nThe c omparison of the different populations proves the influence of the maintenance practices of the \npower transformers in the presence of 2FAL in the oil, and in consequence in the degradation rate of the \nsolid insulation. Large power transformers are subjected to more rigorous maintenance programs than small \ntransformers so the percentile 90th rises much more with transformer age than that of the low power \ntransformers.  \n \nTable 6. 2FAL Percentiles as a function of transformer rating and age. \n \n2FAL (ppm) \nMVA Rating Percentile 90th Percentile 95th Percentile 98th \nTRANSFORMER AGE 0-10 yrs. \nMVA<5 0.3 0.8 1.7 \n5<MVA≤25  0.2 0.5 1.2 \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n0-5 5-25 25-100 100-250 >250 \nFurane-in-oil content (ppm)\nRated power (MVA)\nPerc 90\nPerc 95\nPerc98\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n0-20 20-66 66-132 132-220 >220\nFurane-in-oil content (ppm)\nRated voltage (kV)\nPerc 90\nPerc 95\nPerc98\n25<MVA≤100  0.2 0.4 0.7 \n100<MVA≤250  0.1 0.1 0.2 \nMVA>250  0.1 0.1 0.2 \nTRANSFORMER AGE 10-20 yrs. \nMVA<5 1.1 2.5 5.0 \n5<MVA≤25  1.1 2.7 4.2 \n25<MVA≤100  0.4 1 2.0 \n100<MVA≤250  0.2 1.0 1.7 \nMVA>250  0.1 0.2 0.4 \nTRANSFORMER AGE 20-30 yrs. \nMVA<5 1 1.8 3.3 \n5<MVA≤25  2.4 4.6 8.2 \n25<MVA≤100  0.6 0.9 2.2 \n100<MVA≤250  0.5 1.0 2.1 \nMVA>250  0.3 0.4 0.6 \n \n \nClassification by transformer type  \nThe importance of classifying transformers according to their use is also in CIGRE WGD1.01.13 as the \noperation modes and typical loading profiles are very different depending on the application the \ntransformer.  Design differences also exist between these transformers.    \nThe transformers in the database were divided into six categories according to their application: \ntransmission, distribution, generation, renewable generation, railw ay traction and industrial transformers. \nThe industrial transformers where also divided into two groups according to their rated power. The number \nof records and percentile values are shown in Table 7. \nIn the initial database the number of distribution tra nsformers was very scarce. To get a more complete \npicture of the 2FAL content in transformers of different industrial areas, the original database was \ncomplemented with 602 entries from a database provided by an utility. The percentile values were \ncalculated according to all the available data.  \n \n \nTable 7: Number of records available of the different transformer application and 2FAL percentiles. \n \nTransformer application No. of \ntransformers \nPercent \n(%) \n2FAL (ppm) \nPercentile \n90th \nPercentile \n95th \nPercentile \n98th \nTransmission 3107 17.00 0.4 0.7 1.7 \nDistribution* 69 + 602 0.38 0.8 1.5 3.0 \nGeneration 5349 29.26 0.5 1 2 \nRenewable generation 45 0.25 3.5 4 4.1 \nRailway traction 416 2.27 0.6 0.9 1.3 \nIndustrial \nMVA < 10  4715 25.79 1.9 4 8.3 \nMVA > 10  4366 23.88 1 2.3 4.9 \nTotal 9081 49.68 1.5 3.2 6.5 \nOthers and unknown 213 1.17 - - - \n \n \nTable 7 and Fig. 6 show the 2FAL percentiles for each category. As can be seen transformers from \nutilities have the lowest furan contents. This is due to better maintenance practices. As the responsibility of \nthe transformer is higher the furan content is lower. So transmis sion transformer has the lowest furan \ncontent. In the opposite side are industrial transformers, especially those of lower ratings, where the \nmaintenance policies are usually less demanding.   \n \n \n \nFigure 6. Percentiles 90th, 95th and 98th of 2FAL for the various transformer applications.  \n \nMotive for analysis \nFinally the database population was divided according to the motive for the analysis. The categories \nconsidered were: periodic revision, transformer failure, Buchholz trip, and oil treatment. Some records \nwere also available from transformer commissioning. \nThe entries in each category are shown in Table 8. Unfortunately a great number of the entries in the \ndatabase do not include information related to the motive for the analysis, an d so, some of the percentiles \ndisplayed in the table were calculated with a low number of entries. \n \nTable 8: Number of records available for the various motives for analysis and percentile values. \n \nMotive for  analysis  No. of \ntransformers \nPercent \n(%) \n2FAL (ppm) \nPercentile \n90th \nPercentile \n95th \nPercentile \n98th \nRoutine revision 8841 48.36 0.9 1.8 3.9 \nFailure 82 0.45 1.8 1.9 2.0 \nBuchholz trip 100 0.55 0.9 1.7 2.1 \nCommissioning 16 0.10 0 0 0 \nUnknown 9241 50.55 - - - \n \n \nThe values of the percentiles can be seen in Table 8 and in Fig ure 7.

In \naddition, the data must also be checked for the furan growth rate, as this is indicative of the rate of paper  \naging, and therefore if transformer failure is likely.  For this reason it has been considered necessary to \nconduct a study on the growth rates of 2FAL using the records included in the database.  \nIn this study, the percentiles of the 2FAL growth rates were calculated. General values based on the \nentire database were obtained and also typical values for different transformer ages.  \n \nGrowth rate calculation procedure \nNone of the present standards include recommendations on the calculation of typical growth rates of \ngases and furans in transformer oil .  As such, a method was developed that guarantees the reliability of the \nobtained values. In the procedure, filtering of the database in that:  \n1. Records from transformers with analysis after commissioning less than one year were not considered.  \n2. Records from transformers having less than four consecutive analyses were not considered.  \n3. Records from transformers with only a few available 2FAL records also were not considered.  \nFilters 1 and 2 were applied to the CEIS database. After the first filter , 17,746 records from 3,778 \ntransformers of 154 companies remained and after the second  filter, 13,398 records corresponding to 1,253 \ntransformers from 68 companies remained.  \nTwo different cases were considered to obtain the growth rate: \n• When all the values of 2FAL recorded for a particular transformer are lower or equal to 0.2 ppm , the \ngrowth rate obtained is the maximum value of 2FAL divided by the transformer age. \n• For transformers having at least one of the 2FAL records higher than 0.2 ppm, the slop e was \nsectionalized. \nIt must be highlighted that in 53 out of 1,253 transformers (4.2%) had reclaimed oil within the analyzed \nperiod. Also, only 22 transformers (1.8%) exceeded the threshold of 8 ppm  for 2FAL. When the 2FAL \nvalue exceeded the threshold, it was considered that an internal failure had occurred in the transformer and \n2FAL growth rates do not correspond to a healthy transformer.  \n \nGeneral values of the growth rate \nTable 9 shows the 90th, 95th and 98th percentiles of the 2FAL growth rates in ppm/yr calculated according \nto the developed procedure. As can be seen, the 90th percentile is about 0.1 ppm/year, which means a 2FAL \ncontent of 3 ppm after 30 years of service.   \n \nTable 9.

In most  models a logarithmic relation betwee n DP and the \nconcentration of 2FAL in oil is considered, what would mean that the  generation of 2FAL is more a brupt \nduring the last part of the life of the insulation [3, 6, 8].  \nTo study the dependency of the 2FAL generation rate with transformer age, the database was divided into \npopulations according to transformer age. It should be noted that data for each transformer corresponded to \nvery different dates, and as the growth rate depends on transformer age, different growth rates are possible. \nThe distribution of data according the age of the transformer is shown in Fig ure 8, and the typical growth \nrates calculated using these data are shown in Table 10. \n \nFigure 8. Distribution according transformer age (in years). \n \nTable 10. 2FAL growth rate (ppm/yr) of 2FAL as a function of transformer age.  \n \nPercentile 0-10 years 10-20years 20-30 years 30-40 years 40-50 years \n90th  0.05  0.11  0.13 0.19  0.14  \n95th  0.11  0.25  0.24  0.36  1.10  \n98th  0.26  0.59 0.52  0.60 2.21  \n \nTo determine if the growth rate depends significantly on the transformer owner, and therefore on the type \nof transformers and the maintenance protocols applied to them , as Cigré suggests [6] , the growth rate s of \n2FAL of the transformers of one particular company were studied.  \nData of 241  transformers belonging to th e company X were analyzed, determining the reference values \nof the 2FAL growth rate for populations of different age. The  obtained values and the numbers of \ntransformers of each group used to do the calculations are shown in Table 11.  \nThe company X is devoted to the generation of energy, and the refore the transformers included in the \nstudy are big units which are subjected to exhaustive maintenance programs.  These programs include the \nperformance of complete oil analysis (inclu ding physical -chemical, dissolved gasses and furanic \ncompounds) at least once a year, and more frequent tests and further maintenance operations if abnormal \nresults are found.  In the case of transformers of nuclear power plants, that are also included in the selected \npopulation, the maintenance programs are even more exigent being the oil analysis monthly or quarterly. \n454 trf\n466 trf481 trf\n356 trf\n60 trf\n0-10 years\n10-20 years\n20-30 years\n30-40 years\n40-50 years\nComparing Tables 10 and 11 it can be seen that the growing rates of 2FAL for the transformers of the \ncompany X are up to 15 times smaller than that calculated for the complete database. as a result of a better \nprogram of transformer maintenance. \n \nTable 1 1. 2FAL growing rate (ppm/yr.) of 2FAL as a function of transformer age for company X , and \nnumber of recording used for the calculation. \n \n 0-10 years 10-20 years 20-30 years 30-40 years 40-50 years All ages \nPercentile 90th 0.01 0.01 0.04 0.07 0.03 0.03 \nPercentile 95th 0.02 0.03 0.07 0.14 0.04 0.05 \nPercentile 98th 0.02 0.04 0.22 0.23 0.41 0.09 \nNumber of transformers 109 68 71 75 28 241 \n \nConclusions  \nThe study examined typical values of 2FAL as a function of transformer characteristics.  T he database \nwas divided according to transformer age, cooling system, rated voltage and power, transformer \napplication, the reason for the analysis, and the 90 th, 95 th and 98 th percentiles were calculated for each \ntransformer category as proposed by CIGRE WG D1.01.13.  \nThe following conclusions were extracted from the study:  \n• The results showed a significant influence on transformer age.  \n• Factors such as power and voltage rating have an influence due to different oil/paper ratios among \nthe transformers and better maintenance programs for large transformers.  \nTypical growth rates of 2FAL were calculated using a developed method.  Growth rates of 2FAL are also \nobtained for transformer populations according to age, as age has a ma jor influence in the presence of \n2FAL.  \nAlso the quality of the maintenance program and the transformers characteristics seem to have an \nimportance in the determination of the reference values or growing rate of furfural. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by CEIS and by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain \nthrough the project  DPI2012-35819.  \n \nReferences \n[1] Cigré Brochure 323, “ Ageing of Cellulose in Mineral-oil Insulated Transformers”.
