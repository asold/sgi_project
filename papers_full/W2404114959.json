    "abstract": "We evaluate back-off n-gram and recurrent neural network language models for an automatic speech recognition system for medical applications. We also propose an effective and simple multi-domain recurrent neural network architecture which enables training a joint model for all domains. The multi-domain recurrent neural network model outperforms all other compared models.",
