  "abstract": "The leakage field in shell-type transformers is strongly affected by the boundary conditions introduced by the core walls and thus the effect of the core should be considered properly in the leakage inductance calculation. In this paper, a new method for accurate calculation of the leakage inductance of shell-type multi core-segment transformers with circular windings is presented. For this purpose, first, the expressions for self and mutual inductances are derived in cylindrical coordinates considering the core walls as the flux-normal boundary condition. Then, a new approach is proposed for calculating the leakage inductance considering the number and dimensions of the used core segments. The method is developed at first for single and double core-segment transformers (known also as E-core and U-core transformers) and then adopted for shell-type segmented-core transformers. The method is verified by 3-D FEM simulations. The comparisons with the previous analytical methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. A transformer prototype has been built and verification tests have been conducted. The comparisons show that the leakage inductance can be estimated with an error less than 1%, demonstrating a very high accuracy with the proposed method.",
