The SUPPORT tools\nand the ways in which they can be used are described in more\ndetail in the Introduction to this series [1]. A glossary for the\nentire series is attached to each article (see Additional File 1).\nLinks to Spanish, Portuguese, French and Chinese translations\nof this series can be found on the SUPPORT website http://\nwww.support-collaboration.org. Feedback about how to\nimprove the tools in this series is welcome and should be sent to:\nSTP@nokc.no.\nScenarios\nScenario 1: You are a senior civil servant and have been sent a\npolicy brief that describes the research evidence about an issue\nthat is of growing concern to the Minister. You are responsible\nfor ensuring that the policy brief profiles research evidence in a\nway that informs different elements of the issue and recognises\nthe importance of drawing on both local and global evidence.\nYou want to ensure that the policy brief won't place the Minister\nin an awkward position by making a recommendation that is\nnot politically or economically feasible.\nScenario 2: You work in the Ministry of Health and have been\ngiven a few hours to prepare an assessment of a policy brief that\nhas been sent to the Ministry on a high-priority issue. All that\nyou have been told is that this policy brief is different in a\nnumber of ways to the type of policy brief that you have pro-\nduced in the past including the way in which it profiles research\nevidence about a problem, the options and implementation con-\nsiderations, and the fact that it does not conclude with a specific\nrecommendation.\nScenario 3: You work in an independent unit that supports the\nMinistry of Health in its use of research evidence in policymak-\ning. You are preparing a policy brief for both the Ministry and\nkey stakeholders to profile what is known and not known about\na problem, options for addressing it, and implementation con-\nsiderations. You have been told to prepare the brief in a system-\natic way and to report the methods and findings in a\ntransparent and readily understandable way, but you want\nguidance on how to be both thorough and efficient in your\nwork.\nBackground\nFor policymakers (Scenario 1), this article suggests a\nnumber of questions that they might ask themselves or\ntheir staff to consider when assessing a policy brief. For\nthose who support policymakers (Scenarios 2 and 3), this\narticle suggests a number of questions to guide the assess-\nment of a policy brief or the preparation of one.\nThree major shifts have occurred recently in the focus of\nmany efforts to package research evidence for policymak-\ners. Firstly, there has been a shift from packaging single\nstudies to packaging systematic reviews of studies that\naddress typical policy-relevant questions. A number of\nresearch groups, including the SUPPORT collaboration\nhttp://www.support-collaboration.org/, now produce\npolicymaker-friendly summaries of systematic reviews.\nThese summaries always highlight the key messages from\nthe review but some of them, like SUPPORT summaries,\nalso address considerations related to quality, local appli-\ncability, and equity [2]. This shift has made it easier for\npolicymakers to scan broadly across large bodies of\nresearch evidence. And it has also enabled them to extract\nwhat they need to know easily from particular systematic\nreviews that directly address key features of any policy\nissue of interest.\nSecondly, there have been more recent complementary\nefforts to package systematic reviews (together with local\nresearch evidence) in the form of a new product - the pol-\nicy brief - which mobilises the best available research evi-\ndence on high-priority issues [3]. For policy briefs, the\nstarting point is the issue and not the related research evi-\ndence that has been produced or identified. Once an issue\nis prioritised, the focus then turns to mobilising the full\nrange of research evidence addressing the different fea-\ntures of the issue concerned. These include the underlying\nproblem, options to address the problem, and key imple-\nmentation considerations. Drawing on available system-\natic reviews makes the process of evidence mobilisation\nfeasible in a way that would not otherwise be possible if\nsingle studies had to be identified and synthesised for all\nthe features of the issue. In this article, we have restricted\nour use of the term 'policy brief' to those products match-\ning this description exactly. But the term has also been\napplied elsewhere to many other types of products pre-\npared by those supporting policymakers. The appropria-\ntion of this term by those involved in producing and\nsupporting the use of research evidence reflects perhaps\ntheir increasing orientation to the needs and contexts of\npolicymakers.\nEvidence-packaging mechanisms and policy briefs in par-\nticular have been developed largely as a response to the\nfindings of systematic reviews of factors influencing the\nuse of research evidence in policymaking [4,5]. Three fac-\ntors in particular have emerged as significant. These are: 1.\nTiming or timeliness, 2. Accordance between the research\nevidence and the beliefs, values, interests, or political\ngoals and strategies of policymakers and stakeholders,\nand 3. Interactions between researchers and policymakers.\nHaving access to both a stock of the summaries of system-\natic reviews and policy briefs helps to address the need\nthat policymakers have for timely inputs to policymaking\nprocesses [6]. Review summaries and policy briefs can typ-\nically be produced in days and weeks rather than the\nmonths or years required to prepare a systematic review\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S13 http://www.health-po licy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S13\nPage 3 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nfrom scratch. Undertaking primary research (i.e. original\nstudies) can be similarly and often more time intensive.\nEvidence-packaging mechanisms, and policy briefs in par-\nticular, can also make it easier for policymakers and other\nstakeholders to determine whether and how the available\nresearch evidence accords with their own beliefs, values,\ninterests, or political goals and strategies. With a problem\nclarified, what is known and not known about the options\nclearly described, and key implementation considerations\nclearly flagged, policymakers may be more readily able to\nidentify viable ways forward.\nThirdly, changes have occurred in the purpose for which\npackaged research evidence has typically been produced.\nPolicy briefs are increasingly used as an input into policy\ndialogues involving individuals drawn from those who\nwill be involved in, or affected by, decisions about a par-\nticular issue. These dialogues provide the opportunity for\ngreater interaction between researchers and policymakers.\nDialogues in which research evidence is just one input in\na policy discussion form the focus of Article 14 in this\nseries [7].\nThe formats used for evidence-packaging have often been\ndeveloped in response to the few available empirical stud-\nies of the preferences of health policymakers for different\nkinds of mechanisms (and not their usage or effects, which\ntypically have not been evaluated) [4,8]. These studies\nhave revealed a need amongst policymakers to have for-\nmats that both provide graded entry to the full details of a\nreview and facilitate assessment of decision-relevant infor-\nmation [4]. A graded-entry format of one page of take-\nhome messages, a three-page executive summary that\nsummarises the full report, and a 25-page report (i.e. a\n1:3:25 format) has shown to be particularly promising\n[9]. Presumably, either the one- or three-page summary\nshould follow a structured format [10]. Structured\nabstracts have been found to have an effect on intermedi-\nate outcomes such as searchability, readability and recall\namong healthcare providers. However, no studies have\ncompared full text to structured abstracts and no studies\nhave examined the impact of format features on policy-\nmakers [11]. Decision-relevant information can include\nthe important impacts (both benefits and harms) and\ncosts (i.e. resources used) of policy and programme\noptions, as well as local applicability and equity consider-\nations [4].\nQuestions to consider\nThe following questions can be used to guide the prepara-\ntion and use of policy briefs to support evidence-informed\npolicymaking:\n1. Does the policy brief address a high-priority issue and\ndescribe the relevant context of the issue being addressed?\n2. Does the policy brief describe the problem, costs and\nconsequences of options to address the problem, and the\nkey implementation considerations?\n3. Does the policy brief employ systematic and transpar-\nent methods to identify, select, and assess synthesised\nresearch evidence?\n4. Does the policy brief take quality, local applicability,\nand equity considerations into account when discussing\nthe research evidence?\n5. Does the policy brief employ a graded-entry format?\n6. Was the policy brief reviewed for both scientific quality\nand system relevance?\n1. Does the policy brief address a high-priority issue and \ndescribe the relevant context of the issue being addressed?\nPolicy briefs are distinguished most clearly from other\npackaged evidence summaries by the fact that they begin\nwith the explicit identification of a high-priority issue. In\ninstances where an issue has been on the agenda of key\nstakeholders for some time, policy briefs may act as a way\nto spur progress. This is highlighted in the example shown\nin Table 1 of low coverage rates for artemisinin-based\ncombination therapies (ACT) to treat uncomplicated fal-\nciparum malaria in sub-Saharan African countries. Alter-\nnatively, if the issue is relatively new, the policy brief may\nplay an agenda-setting role. Either way, it is critical that\nthe issue is deemed a priority by at least some key stake-\nholders. Ideally the prioritisation process should also be\nsystematic and transparent and Article 3 in this series out-\nlines an approach for achieving this [12].\nA second key feature of policy briefs is that they are typi-\ncally context-specific. Describing the key features of a con-\ntext in the policy brief is important as a way of creating a\nlevel playing field among policy brief readers. Table 2\nhighlights issues related to limited or inequitable access to\nsustainable, high-quality community-based primary\nhealthcare in Canada. There, as the policy brief explained,\nthe issue could only be understood in the context of the\nparticular features of Canadian primary healthcare and\nthe existence of 'private delivery/public payment' arrange-\nments with physicians. These are of particular importance\nin this context for they have meant historically that most\nprimary healthcare in Canada is delivered by physicians\nworking in private practice with first-dollar, public (typi-\ncally fee-for-service) payment [13]. Improving access in\ncreative ways, including the use of collaborative practice\nmodels, requires an understanding that: 1. Physicians\ntend to be wary of potential infringements on their profes-\nsional and commercial autonomy, 2. No other healthcare\nproviders at this time can secure the public payment\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S13 http://www.health-po licy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S13\nPage 4 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nrequired to function independently as primary healthcare\nproviders on a viable scale, and 3. Many forms of care\n(including prescription drugs and home care services)\nwould still not be covered [14].\n2. Does the policy brief describe the problem, costs and \nconsequences of options to address the problem, and the \nkey implementation considerations?\nA policy brief would ideally describe different features of\na problem, what is known (and not known) about the\ncosts and consequences of options for addressing the\nproblem, and key implementation considerations. As out-\nlined in Article 4, a problem can be understood in one or\nmore of the following terms [15]:\n1. The nature and burden of the actual common diseases\nand injuries that the healthcare system must prevent or\ntreat\n2. The cost-effective programmes, services and drugs that\nare needed for prevention and treatment, and\n3. The broader health system arrangements that deter-\nmine access to, and the use of, cost-effective programmes,\nservices and drugs, including how they affect particular\ngroups.\nA policy brief would help to clarify the problem by diag-\nnosing it in one or more of these terms.\nIdeally, the number of options described in a brief that is\nto be presented to senior policymakers would conform to\nlocal document conventions. Three-option models, for\ninstance, are familiar to many policymakers. But regard-\nless of the number selected, each option in the policy brief\ncan be characterised in terms of:\n• The benefits of each option\nTable 1: Outline of a policy brief about supporting the widespread use of a new, highly effective treatment for malaria in an African \ncountry\nWhat problem has been identified?\n• The overarching problem is one of low coverage rates for artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) to treat uncomplicated falciparum \nmalaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Key features of the problem include:\n• A high incidence of, and death rates from, malaria\n• Existing treatments have much lower cure rates than ACT. However, patients often favour existing treatments because of their past \nexperiences and the higher price of ACT\n• The national malaria control policy, treatment guidelines, and drug formulary in many countries do not all support the prescription, dispensing \nand use of ACT\n• Delivery arrangements for ACT often rely primarily on physicians but not everyone has regular access to them and many are comfortable \nreceiving care from community health workers. Financial arrangements favour existing treatments over ACT (which is much more expensive) \nyet some patients are sceptical about heavily subsidised medication. Governance arrangements often do not allow community health workers to \nprescribe ACT and do not protect against counterfeit or substandard drugs\nWhat information do systematic reviews provide about three viable options to address the problem?\n• Each of the following three options was assessed in terms of the likely benefits, harms, costs (and cost-effectiveness), key elements of the policy \noption if it was tried elsewhere, and the views and experiences of relevant stakeholders:\n• Enlarge the scope of practice for community health workers to include the diagnosis of malaria and prescription of ACT (governance \narrangements), introduce target payments for achieving a defined coverage rate for ACT treatment (financial arrangements), and provide them \nwith training and supervision for the use of both rapid diagnostic tests and prescribing (delivery arrangements)\n• Introduce partial subsidies for both rapid diagnostic tests and ACT within the private sector where much care is provided in urban areas \n(financial arrangements)\n• Restrict the types of anti-malaria drugs that can be imported and introduce penalties for those found dispensing counterfeit or substandard \ndrugs (governance arrangements) and make changes to the national malaria control policy and drug formulary to ensure that ACT is the \nrecommended first-line treatment\n• Important uncertainties about each option's benefits and potential harms were flagged in order to give them particular attention as part of any \nmonitoring and evaluation plan put into place\nWhat key implementation considerations need to be borne in mind?\n• A number of barriers to implementation were identified, among which were the familiarity of some patients and healthcare providers with existing \ntreatment options and their resistance to change. Systematic reviews about the effects of mass media campaigns, the effects of strategies for \nchanging healthcare provider behaviour generally, and for influencing prescribing and dispensing specifically, all proved helpful in deciding how to \naddress these barriers\nNotes about the supporting evidence base:\n• Six systematic reviews about anti-malarial drugs had been published since the release of the World Health Organization guidelines in 2006, all of \nwhich lent further support to ACT as the recommended first-line treatment\n• Of the systematic reviews identified: two addressed relevant governance arrangements, six addressed financial arrangements, five addressed \nspecific configurations of human resources for health, and fifteen addressed implementation strategies, many of which could be supplemented by \nlocal studies\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S13 http://www.health-po licy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S13\nPage 5 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n The harms of each option\n The costs of each option or their relative cost-effective-\nness (if possible)\n The degree of uncertainty related to these costs and con-\nsequences (so that monitoring and evaluation can focus\non particular areas of uncertainty if any given option is\npursued)\n Key elements of the policy option if it has been tried\nelsewhere and adaptation is being considered, and\n Stakeholder views about and experiences with each\noption\nA policy brief would help to make clear the trade-offs\ninvolved in selecting one option over others. If the\noptions are not designed to be mutually exclusive, a policy\nbrief would also help to make clear the benefits of com-\nbining particular elements of the different options and\nwhich combination of options might bring about positive\nsynergies. Alternatively, the elements from one or more\nindividual options could be presented first, followed by\n'bundles' of options combining different elements in var-\nious ways.\nBarriers to implementation (outlined in further detail in\nArticle 6 in this series) are located at different levels, rang-\ning from the consumer (citizen or healthcare recipient)\nlevel through to healthcare providers, organisations, and\nbroader systems [16]. Policy briefs would help to identify\nTable 2: Outline of a policy brief about improving access to high quality primary healthcare in Canada\nWhat problem has been identified?\n• The problem is limited or inequitable access to sustainable, high-quality community-based primary healthcare in federal, provincial, and territorial \npublicly-funded health systems in Canada. Key characteristics of the problem include:\n• Chronic diseases represent a significant share of the common conditions that must be prevented or treated by the primary healthcare system\n• Access to cost-effective programmes, services and drugs in Canada is not ideal. This is the case both when Canadians identify their own care \nneeds or (more proactively on the part of healthcare providers) when they have an indication (or need) for prevention or treatment, particularly \nfor chronic disease prevention and treatment\n• Health system arrangements have not always supported the provision of cost-effective programmes, services and drugs. Many Canadians do \nnot:\n1. Have a regular physician or place of care\n2. Receive effective chronic-disease management services, or\n3. Receive care in a primary healthcare practice that uses an electronic health record, faces any financial incentive for quality, or provides nursing \nservices\nWhat is more difficult to determine is the proportion of physicians who receive effective continuing professional development for chronic disease \nmanagement and the proportion of primary healthcare practices that:\n1. Are periodically audited for their performance in chronic disease management\n2. Employ physician-led or collaborative practice models, and\n3. Adhere to a holistic primary healthcare model's (the Chronic Care Model's) key features [21]\nWhat information do systematic reviews provide about three viable options to address the problem?\n• Each of the following three options was assessed in terms of its likely benefits, harms, costs (and cost-effectiveness), its key elements if it had been \ntried elsewhere, and stakeholder views about and experiences with it:\n• Support the expansion of chronic disease management in physician-led care through a combination of electronic health records, target \npayments, continuing professional development, and auditing of their primary healthcare practices\n• Support the targeted expansion of inter-professional, collaborative practice primary healthcare\n• Support the use of the Chronic Care Model in primary healthcare settings. This model entails the combination of self-management support, \ndecision support, delivery system design, clinical information systems, health system, and community\n• Important uncertainties about each option's benefits and potential harms were flagged. This was done in order to give these issues particular \nattention within any monitoring and evaluation plan put into place\nWhat key implementation considerations need to be borne in mind?\n• Little empirical research evidence could be identified about implementation barriers and strategies. Four of the implementation barriers identified \nwere:\n1. Initial wariness amongst some patients of potential disruptions to their relationship with their primary healthcare physician\n2. Wariness on the part of physicians (particularly older physicians) of potential infringements on their professional and commercial autonomy\n3. The organisational scale required for some of the options is not viable in many rural and remote communities, and\n4. Hesitancy on the part of governments about broadening the breadth and depth of public payment for primary healthcare, particularly during a \nrecession\nNotes about the supporting evidence base:\n• Dozens of relevant systematic reviews were identified, some of which addressed an option directly and others of which addressed elements of \none or more options [14]\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S13 http://www.health-po licy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S13\nPage 6 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthese barriers and describe what can reasonably be\nexpected (again, in terms of benefits, harms, and costs) as\na result of pursuing alternative implementation strategies\nto address these barriers. A policy brief could also identify\nconsiderations related to the preparation of a monitoring\nand evaluation plan. Table 3 provides a possible outline\nfor a policy brief.\n3. Does the policy brief employ systematic and transparent \nmethods to identify, select, and assess synthesised research \nevidence?\nPolicymakers and a wide range of stakeholders who will\nbe involved in or affected by a decision, are the main audi-\nence of a policy brief. Research language should therefore\nbe kept to a minimum as most people will be unfamiliar\nwith it. A policy brief, nevertheless, should still ideally\ndescribe how synthesised research evidence was identi-\nTable 3: Possible outline of a policy brief\nTitle (possibly in the form of a compelling question)\nKey messages (possibly as bullet points)\n• What is the problem?\n• What do we know (and not know) about viable options to address the problem?\n• What implementation considerations need to be borne in mind?\nReport\n• Introduction that describes the issue and the context in which it will be addressed\n• Definition of the problem such that its features can be understood in one or more of the following terms:\n1.

This objective can be achieved by using techniques\nsuch as explanatory 'boxes' within the brief to clarify or\nhighlight particular concepts, or through the inclusion of\nadditional appendices. The methods, too, should be sys-\ntematic in nature and reported in a transparent yet under-\nstandable way. For example, users could be provided with\na description of how systematic reviews addressing the\nbenefits and harms of particular health system arrange-\nments were identified through a search of continuously\nupdated databases containing reviews in particular\ndomains. This could provide significant reassurance to\nreaders that most, if not all, key reviews had been found\nand that few, if any, key reviews had been missed.\n4. Does the policy brief take quality, local applicability, \nand equity considerations into account when discussing \nthe research evidence?\nSystematic reviews may be of high or low quality, their\nfindings may be highly applicable to a given policy-\nmaker's setting or of very limited applicability, and they\nmay or may not give consideration to the impacts an\noption is likely to have on disadvantaged groups, and on\nequity in a specific setting. Ideally, a policy brief would\nflag such variations for policymakers and other readers. As\noutlined in Article 8, explicit criteria are available to assist\nwith quality assessments [17]. Importantly, some data-\nbases of systematic reviews, such as Rx for Change http://\nwww.rxforchange.ca, provide quality ratings for all\nreviews contained in the database. If possible, a policy\nbrief would provide a quality review for all systematic\nreviews from which key messages have been extracted.\nExplicit criteria are also available to assist with local appli-\ncability assessments and these are outlined in further\ndetail in Article 9 [18]. Given that policy briefs are typi-\ncally context-specific, a policy brief would also ideally\ncomment on the local applicability of the findings of any\nsystematic reviews that are critical to an understanding of\nthe impacts of any options being considered. Equity con-\nsiderations can also be addressed using explicit criteria\n(see Article 10) [19]. A policy brief should also note in its\nintroduction whether any groups have been given partic-\nular attention in the brief. Group-specific key messages\ncould be added to the overall key messages in each sec-\ntion.\n5. Does the policy brief employ a graded-entry format?\nA policy brief would ideally allow busy policymakers and\nother readers to scan the key messages quickly in order to\ndetermine whether these corresponded sufficiently closely\nto their key issue of concern and context to warrant read-\ning the entire document. A graded-entry format could take\na number of forms. These could be achieved, for example,\nthrough a 1:3:25 format - i.e. one page of take-home mes-\nsages, a three-page executive summary, and a 25page\nreport [9]. Or a brief may take the form of a 1:12 format,\nwith one page of take-home messages followed by a 12-\npage report. Whatever form is chosen, the minimum that\na policy brief should contain is a list of key messages, a\nreport, and a reference list for those who wish to read\nmore. The key messages would range from the identifica-\ntion of the problem through what is known about the\noptions, and the key considerations for implementation.\nA number of other features of a policy brief could engage\npotential readers and facilitate assessments of who was\ninvolved in preparing, informing and funding it. The title\nof a policy brief could be worded in a way that would\nengage policymakers and other stakeholders. This could\nbe achieved, for example, by using a compelling question\nas a title. The cover and/or the acknowledgements section\nof a policy brief could provide a list of authors and their\naffiliations. It could also include a list of those involved in\nestablishing the terms of reference of the policy brief, a list\nof the key informants contacted for additional perspec-\ntives on the issue and to identify relevant data and\nresearch evidence, and their affiliations. A list of funders\nfor both the organisation producing the policy brief and\nthe policy brief itself, and a statement about any conflicts\nof interest among authors could also form part of the pol-\nicy brief document.\n6. Was the policy brief reviewed for both scientific quality \nand system relevance?\nPolicy briefs need to meet two standards: scientific quality\nand system relevance. To ensure this, the review process\ncould involve at least one policymaker, at least one other\nstakeholder, and at least one researcher. This so-called\nmerit review process differs from a typical peer review proc-\ness that would typically only involve researchers in the\nreview process, and hence focus primarily on scientific\nquality. Involving policymakers and other stakeholders\ncan help to ensure the brief's relevance to the health sys-\ntem.\nConclusion\nPolicy briefs are a new approach to supporting evidence-\ninformed policymaking. Their preparation and use con-\ntinues to evolve through practical experience. Evaluations\nof this new approach are needed in order to improve our\nunderstanding of which particular design features are well\nreceived for particular types of issues and in particular\ncontexts. Describing the different features of a problem\nmay, for example, be perceived as being particularly\nimportant for highly politicised topics where the very\nnature of the problem is contentious. Taking equity con-\nsiderations into account through a focus on only one\ngroup may be perceived as inappropriate in political sys-\ntems that may have a long tradition of either addressing\nall major ethnocultural groups in policy documents or\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S13 http://www.health-po licy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S13\nPage 8 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nperhaps of focusing on no groups in particular. Evalua-\ntions are also necessary as a way of improving our under-\nstanding of whether, and how, policy briefs influence\npolicymaking. Table 4 provides a description of one\napproach to the formative evaluation of policy briefs.\nResources\nUseful documents and further reading\n- Research Matters.
