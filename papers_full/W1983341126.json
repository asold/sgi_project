Primate archaeology benefits\npalaeoanthropological research by providing comparative data for\nthe evolution of hominin technology and landscape use, in\naddition to reconstructing the behavioural history of wild primates\nthrough the recovery and recording of tools used by these animals\n[9–12]. Stone tools are particularly important as their durability\nincreases the likelihood that they will survive in the archaeological\nrecord. The only primates currently known to use stone tools in\nthe wild are western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), bearded and\nyellow-breasted capuchin monkeys ( Sapajus libidinosus and S.\nxanthosternos), and Burmese long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis\naurea) [13–16]. Although widely separated both geographically and\nphylogenetically in the ape, New World and Old World monkey\nlineages respectively, all these species use stones to pound open\nencased foods. Other wild species that use stone tools, including\ndigger wasps (Ammophila and Sphex sp.), sea otters (Enhydra lutis) and\nEgyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) [17], also use these tools as\npounding implements.\nUse-wear analyses can play an important role in characterising\nstone tools used by non-human primates, as these tools are not\ndeliberately modified by the animals and use-damage is a primary\nmeans of distinguishing natural from utilised stones [13]. Previous\nstudies have reported pits on tool surfaces that result from attrition\nduring repeated pounding impacts [3,4,6,18,19], although the\nprocess of pit formation has not been quantified and other types of\nuse-wear are not systematically described [1,20]. Pits found on\nMiddle Pleistocene artefacts from Israel have been attributed to\nhominin nut-cracking activities [21], and damaged pounding tools\nhave been described from the African Early Stone Age [22] and in\nexperimental contexts [23]. To our knowledge there are no\nsystematic published data on the types and surface distribution of\nuse-wear on non-human primate tools, despite the potential value\nof such data as a means of (i) identifying tools and their use-history\nin the absence of direct observation, and (ii) interpreting the\naction, precision, and grips used by wild tool-using primates. Here,\nwe report the first quantitative use-wear analysis of stone pounding\ntools used by wild Burmese long-tailed macaques ( Macaca\nfascicularis aurea), the only known stone tool using wild Old World\nmonkeys.\nBurmese long-tailed macaques use stone tools as foraging aids to\nprocess marine invertebrates and plant parts in coastal areas and\nmangroves in Thailand and Myanmar [15,20,24,25]. Their use of\nstones is only known to occur at a few sites, and where these\nmacaques use stones as tools the behaviour is customary [26],\nfollowing the definition of customary as ‘enacted regularly or\npredictably by all appropriate members of a group or population’\n[27]. As a product of their regular tool use activity, these macaques\nleave large amounts of debris in the intertidal zone, including\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e72872\nscarred tools and fragments of shelled marine organisms and\nseashore nuts.M. f. aurea stone tool use has been categorized into\ntwo basic tool-use styles, axe-hammering and pound-hammering,\nwhich were identified based on both physical characteristics of the\nstones and how the macaques used them [20]. Axe hammers are\ngenerally smaller and used with more rapid strikes, greater\nprecision and more control than larger pound hammers. Axe-\nhammering also is largely directed at sessile oysters, while pound\nhammering is mainly used for processing non-sessile shelled items,\nsuch as gastropods, nuts and crabs [25]. Another difference is that\ndamage found on axe hammers is more often associated with the\npointed ends of the tool, while for pound hammers damage is\nfound more frequently on the tool face [20]. Consequently, these\ntwo different usage patterns produce differing wear patterns on the\nstones.\nOur aims in this study were to characterise the use-wear types\nand distribution on a sample of stone tools used by wild long-tailed\nmacaques, and to develop analytical procedures that could reliably\ndistinguish wear patterns characteristically produced onM. f. aurea\nstone tools used as axe or pound hammers. By matching use-wear\npatterns to behaviour, we aim to help researchers to identify and\ninterpret macaque stone tools recovered during excavations or\nfield surveys within areas currently or previously inhabited by\nlong-tailed macaques.\nMethods\nStudy site and subjects\nWe studied stone tools used by wild Burmese long-tailed\nmacaques on Piak Nam Yai (PNY) island, located in Laem Son\nNational Park, Ranong Province, on the west coast of Thailand (N\n9u 34–35’, E 98u 28’) [15,20,26,28] (Figure 1). Tool-using\nmacaques were first noted on PNY in early 2005, during a faunal\nsurvey assessing the impact of the major Indian Ocean tsunami of\nlate 2004. PNY has an area of 1.7 km 2 and consists of\nmountainous tropical forest surrounded by 5.4 km of coastline.\nThe shoreline is subject to tidal fluctuations, and includes rocky\nshore, mangroves and a small sandy beach. Surveys in 2011\nestablished that approximately 200 unhabituated wild macaques\nlive on the island in nine groups [26]. These macaques forage daily\nin the intertidal regions of PNY for sessile and mobile marine\ninvertebrates, and they often use stones to process these foods [25].\nMacaque stone tool use is customary on PNY and 88% of the\nadult and adolescent monkeys on the island have been observed\nusing stone tools [26]. They are unique among the known tool-\nusing non-human primates in that they regularly process a wide\nvariety of fauna using stone tools.\nTool collection\nMG collected 60 stone tools from the rocky shores and\nmangroves of PNY between February and April 2011. The tool\nmaterials include sandstone, basalt, quartz, and siltstone. All tools\nwere collected immediately following behavioural observations,\nconducted from a boat, of macaque tool use (Figure 2). MG\nidentified the macaque that last used the tool in all cases, as well as\nthe tool style employed and the food that was processed. Tools\nwere selected for collection based on the opportunity of recovering\nthe tool (i.e., the tool was left conspicuously after use and the boat\nwas able to land). The macaques picked up the stones from among\nthe naturally occurring stones on PNY, and the researchers did not\ninfluence their selection in any way. After collection, the stones\nwere measured for physical characteristics, logged into a database,\nand put into storage for later analysis. All tools were photographed\nfor archival purposes.\nUse-wear analysis\nIn May 2012 MH studied the collected tools for macroscopic\nuse-wear. Microscopic use-wear was not examined. All use-wear\ndata were collected blind, without MH having access to the\nobservational data of MG. Previously, Gumert et al. [20] assessed\nstone tools used by Burmese long-tailed macaques as being\ndamaged on their point, edge or face, or any combination of the\nthree. The present study aimed to test whether indirect evidence\nfrom use-wear is able to accurately reconstruct the pounding\ntechniques that were directly observed, and therefore we built on\nthe previous work by including additional specificity and\nquantification of use-wear types and location on each tool. Two\nmethods were used: (i) use-wear assessment that divided each\nartefact’s surface into ten zones and scored damage patterns within\nthose zones, and (ii) 3D laser scanning that documented the types\nof use-damage preserved on the tools (see below for details of the\nrecorded use-wear types). Laser scanning is becoming more\ncommon in archaeology for both data collection and quantitative\nanalyses [29,30], and the use of zones for interpreting the\ndistribution of artefact functional evidence has previously proven\nvaluable in both residue and use-wear analyses [31,32].\nEach artefact was oriented along its long axis with the narrowest\nend towards the top, with ten surface zones defined by dividing the\ntool at 25% and 75% of its length, and 25% and 75% of its width.\nThese zones were numbered as shown in Figure 3. In turn these\nwere clustered into four tool sections for ease of discussion. The\nnarrower tool ‘point’ includes two zones (1, 6), the ‘edges’\ncomprise four zones (2, 4, 7, 9), the ‘base’ includes two zones (5,\n10) at the opposite end of the tool from the point, and there are\ntwo ‘face’ zones (3, 8). Note that the previous study [20] treated\nboth the ends of the tool long axis as ‘points’, and therefore did not\ninclude a ‘base’ category.\nEach zone was scored for the presence of four wear types. The\nfour types were: (i)crushing - abrasion of the stone surface resulting\nfrom impact, including rounding and levelling of protruding parts\nof the tool; (ii)pitting - discrete indentations from individual strikes\nthat may result in cumulative creation of wide depressions in the\nstone surface; (iii)fracture - removal of sections of the stone through\nbreakage, such as chipping or flaking; and (iv)striations - narrow\nlinear scars, usually clustered at the point of impact. Damage on a\ntool resulted either from the impact of the tool with a processed\nfood item, or incidental contact with the underlying substrate, such\nas a rock or mangrove root. Both types of damage were considered\nFigure 1. Location of the study site.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0072872.g001\nUse-Wear Patterns on Wild Macaque Stone Tools\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e72872\nto be use-wear in this study, as they both result from tool use. For\neach wear type the intensity of the wear was recorded on the\nfollowing three-point scale per zone: (1) trace - superficial and\nisolated points of damage only, possibly incidental; (2)moderate –\nthe stone surface was clearly damaged but this damage was\nspatially restricted with only minor evidence of repeated wear; and\n(3) extensive - cumulative damage that may cover a significant\nportion of the use-zone. Except for striations, which proved not to\nbe useful in determining tool use-histories (see below), the types of\nwear and examples of the intensity of each are shown in Figure 4.\n3D scanning of tools\nWe used a portable laser scanner (NextEngine 3D Scanner HD\nwith ScanStudio HD Pro software) to create a digital record of\neach tool, typically at a resolution of 40,000 points per square inch.\nThis digitisation assisted in those instances where unaided\nobservations could not determine whether damage (such as\nsuperficial striations) had permanently altered the stone surface.\nThe 3D scans also permitted clear illustration of damage patterns,\nand archiving of the tool form data for future analyses.\nStatistical analyses\nTo identify the wear types and locations that were significant\npredictors of the observed use of the tools as axe or pound\nhammers, we performed binary logistic regression analyses on our\ncomplete dataset, as well as separately for each of the four wear\ntypes. Mann-Whitney U Tests were used to compare dimensions\n(weight and length) of stones classified as pound and axe hammers\nduring direct observation, and to compare the intensity of use wear\ndamage on tools of different stone materials (basalt and sandstone)\nand observed use-actions. A chi-squared test was used to test for\ndifferences in the proportion of stone materials comprising our\npound and axe hammer samples. Cohen’s kappa coefficient was\nused to assess concordance between directly observed and\npredicted use-actions. Non-parametric tests were used for consis-\ntency throughout the paper, as some sample sizes were small, and\ntherefore our data were unlikely to conform to the assumptions of\nparametric analyses. All statistical tests were two-tailed, with alpha\nset at 0.05.\nFigure 2.

The\nmethods used to collect stone tools from macaques in Thailand\nwere reviewed and approved by the NTU-Institutional Animal\nCare & Use Committee (IACUC) in Singapore (ARF SBS/NIE-A\n0138 AZ).\nResults\nTool weights and lengths\nThe sample of 60 tools ranged from 32 g to 202 g and from\n38 mm to 91 mm in length for axe hammers, and 10 g to 2434 g\nand 51 mm to 235 mm in length for pound hammers (Table 1).\nThe pound hammers were significantly larger than the axe\nhammers in both weight and length (Mann-Whitney U-test,\nn\n1 =4 2 n2 = 18: weight U = 637.5, p,0.001; length U = 634,\np,0.001), replicating previous findings [20].\nUse-Action Index\nThe complete use-wear dataset for all the analysed tools is\nprovided in Table S1. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed\nthat crushing wear on the tool points and faces were significant\npredictors of observed axe or pound hammer classification\n(crushing on points, p = 0.001; crushing on faces, p = 0.009). A\nsimplified model that included only these two variables was able to\npredict observed use-actions with an accuracy of 90% (54 of 60\nuse-actions correctly predicted; odds ratios for crushing on points\nand faces were 0.27 and 3.41 respectively; Nagelkerke’s pseudo-\nR\n2 = 0.73). However, as there is a significant difference in tool\nweights between axe and pound hammers, we hypothesised that\nadding this variable may serve to increase the accuracy of our\npredictions. A binary logistic regression using the three variables\nshowed that crushing remained a significant predictor, while tool\nweight did not reach significance (crushing on points, p = 0.005,\nodds ratio = 0.34; crushing on faces, p = 0.018, odds ratio = 3.40;\ntool weight, p = 0.158, odds ratio = 1.01). Nevertheless, including\nthe weight variable slightly increased the predictive accuracy of the\nmodel, resulting in a match of predicted to observed use-action of\n91.6% (55 of 60 use-actions correctly predicted; Nagelkerke’s\npseudo-R\n2 = 0.81; Table 2).\nWe propose that the resulting equation, which we have named\nthe Use-Action Index (UAI), can therefore assist in distinguishing\nbetween axe and pound hammers at PNY. It is expressed as: UAI\n= 1.21 + (1.076Cp) – (1.226Cf) – (0.0146Wt). In this index, for\neach tool Cp is the total combined intensity value for crushing on\nthe tool point, Cf is the combined crushing value for the tool face,\nand Wt is the tool weight in grams. A positive UAI value derives\nfrom greater intensity of crushing on the tool point and a lower\nrelative weight, and results in classification of a tool as an axe\nhammer. Conversely, tools with a negative UAI derive this value\nfrom greater intensity of crushing on the tool face and higher\nrelative weight, and these were classified as pound hammers. A\nCohen’s kappa value of 0.80 demonstrates that agreement\nbetween the UAI and directly observed data is unlikely to have\nresulted from chance.\nOf the four stone materials included in this study, our sample\ncontained predominantly basalt (n = 43) and sandstone (n = 14),\nwith siltstone (n = 1) and quartz (n = 2) also present. Basalt tools in\nthis sample were used significantly more than expected for\npounding activities, when compared to basalt axe hammers and\nsandstone tools (chi-squared test, p = 0.018). We also compared\nthe average intensity of crushing, pitting and fracture wear per tool\nfor the basalt and sandstone artefacts, excluding the other\nmaterials because of insufficient sample size. The basalt and\nsandstone tools were further separated into those that were directly\nobserved being used as axe or pound hammers, to allow us to\nidentify any differences in the intensity of use-damage across these\nuse-actions. Figure 5 shows the results of this analysis, demon-\nstrating that there is significantly greater crushing wear intensity\nthan pitting or fracture wear on basalt pound and axe hammers\n(basalt pound hammers, n = 33: crushing vs pitting, p = 0.002,\nU = 781.5; crushing vs fractures, p,0.001, U = 798.5; basalt axe\nhammers, n = 10: crushing vs pitting, p,0.001, U = 92.5; crushing\nvs fractures, p = 0.003, U = 87.5). There is also significantly more\ncrushing wear than fractures on sandstone pound and axe\nhammers (sandstone pound hammers, n = 8: crushing vs fractures,\np = 0.038, U = 52.0; sandstone axe hammers, n = 6: crushing vs\nfractures, p = 0.009, U = 34.0). All other relative wear intensities\nwithin these tool classes are not significantly different. These\nresults suggest that on basalt and sandstone artefacts crushing wear\neither (i) develops more rapidly than other wear types during their\nuse by the wild macaques, or (ii) is better preserved than other\nwear types at PNY. In either instance these results present further\njustification for including crushing use-wear in the UAI.\nDiscussion\nBased on a combination of use-wear type, intensity and location\non each tool, as well as tool weight, the Use-Action Index was able\nto differentiate axe and pound hammers used by wild Burmese\nlong-tailed macaques with a success rate of 92%. These results\nconfirm that M. f. aurea tool use leaves identifiable and\nFigure 4. Examples of the pitting, crushing and fracture wear\ntypes.

Three of these (Chr01,\nLuc02 and Sid01) were classified as axe hammers by the UAI, but\nwere observed being used as pound hammers, and for two tools\n(Hly01 and Ogr01) the reverse situation applied. The UAI values\nfor these mis-classified tools ranged from –3.37 to 1.02, close to the\nzero value that divides axe from pound hammers (UAI values for\nthe sample as a whole range from –37.35 to 5.54). Except for\nOgr01, these tools had either equal values for crushing wear\nintensity on the tool point and face, or a single point different\nbetween the two areas. The UAI may not therefore have sufficient\ndiscriminatory power in such borderline cases, although we note\nthat it was successful in predicting the use-action of tools that\nexhibit different types of wear on the face and point, such as Gol02\n(Figure 6). As monkeys at PNY have been observed to occasionally\nuse the same tool for axe and pound hammering (M. Gumert,\nunpublished data), this may also act to obscure behavioural\nreconstructions. The final mis-classified tool, Ogr01, showed\nevidence of crushing on the face but not the point, despite being\nobserved in use as an axe hammer. In such cases, where diagnostic\nuse-damage is not created at the point of contact, a tool’s\nbehavioural history is unlikely to be recoverable through any form\nof use-wear analysis. Microscopic residue analysis of plant or\nanimal remains adhering to the tool [3,33,34] may be of benefit in\nsuch instances.\nIn future, we intend to further refine the use-wear intensity scale\ndeveloped in this study to permit its use in interpreting\narchaeologically recovered tools that have been used by Burmese\nlong-tailed macaques, provided such tools can be reliably\ndistinguished from those of other animals and humans, and from\nTable 1.Macaque stone tool materials, dimensions and weights.\nArtefact Stone L (mm) W (mm) T (mm) Wt (g) Artefact Stone L (mm) W (mm) T (mm) Wt (g)\nAmb01 BA 99.16 68.22 30.22 176 Luc04 BA 114.72 62.29 33.31 216\nAmb02 BA 190 92.63 29.27 834 Luc05 BA 135.57 47.85 17.82 174\nAmb03 BA 119.24 75.93 25.97 376 Luc06 BA 143.21 77.74 31.75 390\nCer01 BA 154.25 74.41 30.43 358 Luc07 SI 127.73 70.56 41.73 478\nChe01 BA 85.35 46.69 19 84 Luc08 BA 75.04 50.46 31.53 118\nChr01 SA 56.63 43.18 37.15 134 Med01 BA 61.39 54.49 15.11 66\nDel01 BA 107.23 55.78 40.49 376 Mrl01 BA 71.15 28.8 18.24 62\nDel02 BA 59.22 38.88 17.04 46 Nef/Hly01 BA 76.04 65.31 33.25 220\nDnt01 BA 65.97 56.49 29.88 150 Nef02 BA 50.45 35.53 12 36\nDrg01 BA 215 178 45.23 2434 Nik02 BA 127.46 119.6 27.64 580\nDrs01 BA 110.11 78.1 28.74 364 Ogr01 SA 58.6 47.36 22.79 66\nEls01 BA 170 96.09 55.04 542 Orc01 BA 114.55 78.48 15.08 18\nEzr01 BA 72.48 58.29 28.7 172 Pat01 BA 169 103.47 53.3 1646\nGol01 QZ 69.16 52.97 33.32 140 Ram02 BA 108.44 67.89 25.42 264\nGol02 SA 71.21 45.09 35.49 150 RamUn BA 176 82.43 33.88 824\nGol03 SA 58.14 44.57 21.34 62 RF001 BA 156 143.5 29.65 1146\nGol04 BA 66.5 36.18 19.14 66 RF002 BA 213 108.2 36.7 1386\nHly01 SA 60.87 49.8 22.01 104 Sat01 BA 87.15 64.62 20.37 178\nIcb01 BA 175 75.77 37.81 624 Sat02 BA 108.83 68.35 25.97 272\nInc02 SA 77.35 66.53 33.72 210 Scr01 SA 109.91 88.65 47.74 528\nInc06 BA 62.08 19.06 19.01 40 Scr02 BA 46.26 34.05 12.23 32\nInc08 SA 74.42 46.71 13.72 62 Sid01 BA 57.09 35.28 15.94 58\nInc09 SA 59.19 27.49 21.54 44 Skp01 BA 191 102.55 36.9 852\nIvy01 BA 113.63 94.24 44.17 692 Sln01 BA 235 220 38.58 2406\nJad01 BA 90.93 74.45 20.03 202 Sln02 BA 154.22 120.64 37.99 1320\nKiy02 BA 68.08 39.75 15.76 64 Smt01 SA 38.01 32.02 29.22 34\nLrl01 BA 221 135.31 39.86 1872 Tik01 QZ 51.82 32.45 30.52 58\nLuc01 SA 51.17 27.7 17.42 10 Zar01 BA 104.3 87.06 54.52 820\nLuc02 BA 50.91 27.38 17.66 20 Zar02 SA 56.27 47.15 31.06 142\nLuc03 SA 56.68 47.72 29.91 80 Zar03 SA 73.98 48.32 30.56 96\nArtefact: Each alphanumeric code is comprised of a three-character identifier of the monkey that used the tool, followed by a number that separates different tools used\nby the one animal.Stone: SA = sandstone, BA = basalt, QZ = quartz, SI = siltstone.

However,\nthe prevalence of crushing wear, the hardness of the encased\ncoastal resources exploited by the macaques on PNY, the use of\ndurable tool materials such as basalt, and the repeated pounding\nactions employed, are all favourable indicators for the long-term\nsurvival and integrity of Burmese long-tailed macaque artefacts.\nWith increased sample sizes in the future, we may also be able to\ndevelop material-specific UAIs that improve the accuracy of our\nbehavioural reconstructions. At the same time, the processes and\nrate of use-wear formation also require study, including factors\ninfluencing damage patterns such as (i) the tool user’s age and sex,\n(ii) the hardness and composition of stones used as tools, and (ii)\nthe hardness and shape of processed foods.\nContinued study of use-wear patterns generated by the PNY\nmacaques will increase the likelihood of correctly identifying\nmacaque tool use sites where this behaviour was previously\npracticed but is not currently present (either through local\nextinction of macaque groups or a temporal break in their tool\nuse traditions). The use of stone tools by Burmese long-tailed\nmacaques was first reported in the coastal regions of Burma, north\nof Laem Son National Park, in the 1880s [24], and along with\nanecdotal reports of present day tool use in east and west coastal\nThailand [26] this suggests that this behaviour previously had a\nmore geographically extensive southeast Asian distribution. We\nhypothesise, therefore, that there are a number of as-yet\nunidentified macaque tool use sites along the Thailand and\nBurmese coasts, with site locations and the spread of tool use by\npast macaque populations influenced by the dramatic sea level\nfluctuations of recent glacial periods [35,36]. A primary means of\nidentifying such sites will be via the recovery, through archaeo-\nlogical survey and excavation, of stones of a size and material\nsuitable for macaque stone pounding. The interpretation of the\nbehavioural history of such stones will rely heavily on use-wear\nevidence.\nConclusion\nWe have demonstrated that use-wear analysis can successfully\nclassify stone artefacts used with two different actions by wild\nBurmese long-tailed macaques. This finding demonstrates that\nuse-wear patterns can reliably reveal the previous history of\nmacaque stone tool behaviour. These data will inform ongoing\nresearch into the hand grips, striking precision, and tool\norientations used by wild macaques both in the present day and\nin the past. We anticipate that the methods employed here can be\nfruitfully applied to other macaque sites in Thailand, and\npotentially to cross-taxa comparisons with other primate and\nhominin species. Further development and refinement of quanti-\ntative analytical techniques, such as the UAI, is necessary to allow\nprimate archaeology to extend our knowledge of non-hominin\ntechnological and behavioural evolution.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Use-wear intensity data.\n(DOCX)\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: MH MG SM.
