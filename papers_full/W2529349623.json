Oil chromatography analysis is the foundation of transformer fault diagnosis, In this paper, based on \nknowledge base of the oil chromatographic analysis, an extended research combining the improved three ratio \nmethodˈBP neural network ˈand case-based reasoning method for the transformer fault diagnosis was \nproposed, in the purpose of building a transformer Intelligent Evaluation Diagnosis model, to improve the \naccuracy of the transformer fault diagnosis, which is of a great significance for practice. \n1 Introduction \nWith the development of society and economy, energy \nand environmental issues is  becoming increasingly \nprominent. In order to meet the requirements of a \nsustainable future, the development and construction of a \nstrong smart grid is an inevitable choice to promote \nChina's economic development. \nSafe operation of the power transformer is to ensure a \nreliable, safety power grid and the necessary conditions \nfor stable operation. The main transformer on-line \nmonitoring of transformer oil chromatogram is analysed \nto determine the latent fault transformer. Oil \nchromatographic analysis is one of the most effective \nmethods of early detection an d prevention of transformer \nfailures. Because the neural network to outside input \nsample has a strong ability to identify and classify \ninformation processing char acteristics of associative \nmemory, making the application of artificial neural \nnetworks and fault diagnosis of transformer combined. \nTherefore, the neural network fault diagnosis method \nbased on chromatographic analysis of transformer oil for \ntransformer fault diagnosis provides a new way.  \n2 Transformer fault diagnosis research \nstatus  \nPower transformer fault, from the development process \ncan be divided into tw o categories: sudden failure and \nlatent failures. For sudden failure we can use some \nconservative measures for prevention, existing methods \nmainly for the purposes of latent failures. Latent failures \ncan be divided into three categories: internal transformer \npartial discharge, local overheating and transformer \ninsulation aging. Power transformer is closely related to \nthe failure of the transformer condition, history log, and \ntransformer models. Therefore, it  is necessary to study \nthe transformer fault, timely and accurate detection of \nearly l atent transformer fault detection and maintenance \nsystem to develop a reasonable, accurate service, improve \nthe reliability of transformers [1]. \nExpert System has received a preliminary application, \nbut the main problem is that the \"bottleneck\" problem of \nknowledge acquisition cannot effectively solve so many \nuncertainties that exist in faul t diagnosis, these problems \ngreatly affected the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Fuzzy \ndiagnosis method using fuzzy matching principle \ntroubleshooting, there are so me false positives, generally \nrarely used. In a variety of intelligent algorithms, neural \nnetwork model with good nonlinear approximation \ncapability has been widely adopted, has been well \ndeveloped in the transformer fault diagnosis [2]. \nIn this paper, the traditional methods and BP intelligent \nalgorithm combined with the introduction of Case-based \ninference and thought transforme r fault diagnosis system, \nconducted in-depth research. \n3 Establish transformer fault diagnosis \nmodel  \nThe failure mechanism of tr ansformers is often very \ncomplex, a ccompanied by a variety of fault generation, \nwhich can be used to charac terize and determine the fault \ntype of state amount is often more than one \ncorrespondence between the amount of state failure and \nmore complicated. Failure mechanism is the basis for \nfault diagnosis master, resear ch and state the amount of \ntransformer failu re relationship is ve ry necessary.

In the absence of a \ntransformer failure, want to run the state of the \ntransformer to predict and fo recast, after a failure of \njudgment transformer fault type, location, cause, degree, \nand maintenance decisions. Specific steps are as follows \n[3]. \n3.2.1 Establish fault sample library \nFailure to create a sample database according to the \ndevice type, model, manu facturer, etc. and the \naccumulation of knowledge and provide training and \nvalidation samples for fault diagnosis algorithm. \n3.2.2 Establish the diagnosis algorithm library \nDiagnostic algorithm library provides various types of \nequipment through the packag e, all kinds of state amount \nof diagnostic algorithms. Di agnostic algorithm used in \nthis paper include traditional DGA algorithm, advanced \nintelligent algorithm with BP  algorithm combines Case-\nbased inference. \n3.2.3 Status diagnostics \nFirstly whether the fault d iagnosis, determine fault, \nrespectively IEC, BP neur al network and Case-based \ninference three methods to conduct a diagnosis, identified \nas overheating fault or electrical  fault, and then use three \nmethods for secondary diagno sis, determine the specific \ntype of fault. \n3.2.4 Diagnostic results \nTo determine what kind of fault to fault location, \ncause of the failure, malfunction, etc. rating judgment. \n3.3 DGA principle \nIn the situation of failure, the transformer oil will be \noxygen-decomposed and split-decomposed, and then \ncreate the hydrogen and low molecule gases. \nUnsaturation of the hydroc arbon gas will increase along \nwith the pyrolysis energy dens ity (temperature) growing. \nDifferent fault, due to the fail ure point energy is different \nat different temperatures and different insulation \nmaterials involved in its pro duction of gas situation is \ndifferent. The use of DGA for device internal fault \njudgment is based on this principle of gas production \ncharacteristics of insulating materials. \nPart of the gas dissolved in transformer oil, part \nfloating on the upper (free gas).The valuab le gases are \nH\n2ǃCH4ǃC2H6ǃC2H2ǃC2H4ǃCO and CO 2.

Consistent with a set of data \ntrends and Case-based devic es in a typical case library \ntrends, then the de vice is currently in good health should \nalso inform the user of the situation, and timely analysis \nof the two sets of data, propose appropriate \nimplementation of counterme asures. Case-based multi-\npoint analysis than just usin g a mathematical model to be \nmore accurate and simple, it is a way of reasoning based \non historical data. \nChange of state of the transformer is nonlinear, \nespecially for off-line data acquisition, affected long \ninterval, the big objective fact ors such as changes in the \nenvironment, and cannot find a proper application of \nmathematical models only. Case -based analysis can just \nsolve nonlinear prediction problem, but it is more \ndifficult to obtain a sample of the data [8-9]. \nYou can build a transformer fault samples Case-based \nlibrary management system or  through the production of \nelectrical equipment on-line m onitoring system. Taking \nof transformer fault samples have been collected, stored \non your computer, we need to be divided into a few \nsimple search space, thereby reducing the load on your \ncomputer to improve retr ieval efficiency.
