Any local interaction potential and emission\nsource function can be used as an input and the wave function\nis evaluated exactly. In this paper we present a study on the\nsensitivity of C(k) to the interaction potential for different\nparticle pairs: p–p, p–/Lambda1,K −–p, K+–p, p–/Xi1− and /Lambda1–/Lambda1.F o r\nthe p–p Argonnev18 and Reid Soft-Core potentials have been\ntested. For the other pair systems we present results based on\nstrong potentials obtained from effective Lagrangians such\nas χEFT for p–/Lambda1, Jülich models for K( ¯K)–N and Nijmegen\nmodels for /Lambda1–/Lambda1.F o rt h ep –/Xi1− pairs we employ the latest\nlattice results from the HAL QCD collaboration. Our detailed\nstudy of different interacting particle pairs as a function of\nthe source size and different potentials shows that femto-\nscopic measurements can be exploited in order to constrain\nthe ﬁnal state interactions among hadrons. In particular, small\ncollision systems of the order of 1 fm, as produced in pp col-\nlisions at the LHC, seem to provide a suitable environment\nfor quantitative studies of this kind.\n1 Introduction\nFemtoscopy has been mainly employed so far to study the\nproperties of the particle emitting source in heavy-ion colli-\nsions by analyzing particle pairs with low relative momentum\nundergoing a known interaction [ 1,2]. In heavy-ion colli-\nsions pion femtoscopy has been the most common tool to\nget insight into the time-space evolution of the produced\nmedium [3–13].\na e-mail: dimitar.mihaylov@mytum.de\nb e-mail: valentina.mantovani-sarti@tum.de\nUnlike heavy-ion collisions, nucleon–nucleon (NN) col-\nlisions are not affected by the formation of a medium such as\nthe Quark–Gluon–Plasma. This means that the time evolu-\ntion of the source can be neglected and the hadron interaction\nis not inﬂuenced by collective processes.\nMore generally, femtoscopy allows to describe any hadron-\nhadron correlation involving both (anti)mesons and (anti)\nbaryons. Recent femtoscopy studies in pp at √s = 7T e V\nand p–Pb at √sNN = 5.02 TeV showed that in these sys-\ntems a smaller source size radius is extracted compared to\nheavy-ion collisions [14–16]. When mesons are considered\nthe correlation function is affected by a mini-jet background\nover the whole k range [14,15]. This effect is also visible in\nbaryon-antibaryon correlations (B– ¯B), where partons from\nthe colliding protons hadronize in particle cones containing\naB – ¯B pair. The production of such pairs is enhanced due\nto the intrinsic baryon number conservation and therefore\nshows a strong kinematic correlation which overlaps to the\ntrue femtoscopic signal in the ﬁnal correlation function. Since\nthese mini-jets are not present in the correlation function of\nB–B/ ¯B– ¯B[ 17], those systems are well suited to study the\nﬁnal state interaction.\nThe femtoscopic formalism includes the computation of\nthe correlation function for a given source function and inter-\naction potential [2]\nC(k) =\n∫\nS(r) | ψk (r) |2 d3r, (1)\nwhere k = (| p1 −p2 |)/2 is the reduced relative momentum\nin the center of mass of the pair (p1 +p2 = 0), r is the relative\ndistance between the two particles,S(r)is the source function\nand ψk (r) is the two-particle wave function.\nThe above formula is based on the assumptions that space\nand momentum emission coordinates are uncorrelated and\nthe emission process is time independent [2]. The dynamics\nof the processes is explicitly embedded on one hand in the\n123\n394 Page 2 of 15 Eur. Phys. J. C (2018) 78 :394\nFig. 1 The probability density function of the relative distance r for\np–p pairs produced in pp collisions at 7 TeV . The blue solid line is the\nprediction from the EPOS transport model, the dashed orange line, the\ngreen dot-dashed line and the dotted red line are Gaussian sources with\ndifferent radii. For better visibility the source with r\n0 = 0.55 fm is\nscaled down by 0.6. The red shaded area shows the typical range of the\nstrong interaction where an approximate solution to the Schrödinger\nequation may fail\nemitting source S(r), which depends on the colliding system,\nand on the other hand in the interaction potential between the\ntwo particles expressed by the relative wave functionψk (r).\nThe source could be either parametrized using a speciﬁc\ndistribution function, e.g. a Gaussian or a Cauchy func-\ntion, or extracted directly from transport models such as\nEPOS [18]. The pair wave function can be obtained by solv-\ning the Schrödinger equation for a speciﬁc interaction poten-\ntial and a popular tool to do that is the Correlation Afterburner\n(CRAB) [19]. This afterburner only delivers the asymptotic\nsolution at large relative distances which eventually leads to\na wrong correlation function at small distances. For heavy-\nion collisions the source radius is typically between 2 and\n6f m[ 3–7]. However in pp collisions at LHC energies the\nextracted source can be even smaller than 1.5 fm [14,15], and\nthe EPOS transport model predicts a non-Gaussian source\nwhich peaks at distances of around 1 fm (see Fig. 1).\nThis calls for a tool capable of providing an exact solution\nof the Schrödinger equation valid also at short distances.\nAnother common approach based on solving the Sch-\nrödinger equation and used to study p–p correlations is the\nKoonin model [ 20]. Here a Gaussian source distribution\nis assumed and the relative wave function is obtained by\nemploying a Coulomb potential and a Reid Soft-Core poten-\ntial for the strong interaction [21].\nAnalytical solutions to compute C(k) do exist, but they\nare limited by different approximations. One of the most\npopular analytical models was developed by Lednický and\nLyuboshits [22]. The emission source is assumed to have a\nGaussian shape and the wave function is modeled within the\neffective range approximation, using the scattering length\n(a\n0) and the effective range of the potential (ref f ). Such a\nparametrization is only sensitive to the asymptotic region of\nthe interaction. Due to its long range nature, the Coulomb\npotential is normally not considered in the Lednický model\nand can at most be treated in an approximate way [ 13].\nAll the above-mentioned issues motivated the develop-\nment of a new femtoscopy tool called “Correlation Analysis\nTool using the Schrödinger equation” (CATS).\nCATS is capable of evaluating numerically the full wave\nfunction without using any approximations and computing\nC(k)for different source functions and interaction potentials.\nCATS is faster than most of the conventional numerical tools\nand also more ﬂexible since it can be used together with an\nexternal ﬁtter.\nThe main purpose of this work is to test the sensitivity of\nthe correlation function to different potentials and provide\nqualitative examples.\nIn particular for p–p and p–/Lambda1interactions we only inves-\ntigate the most common potentials used in femtoscopy so far\nand compare them to more up-to-date potentials.\nThe p–p correlation function has been studied by com-\nparing the Reid Soft-Core [ 21] potential adopted in most\nfemtoscopic analyses to the most recent Argonne v\n18 [23]\npotential which provides a better description of scattering\ndata.\nSimilarly, for the p–/Lambda1combination we compare the com-\nmonly used Usmani potential [ 24] to the most recent NLO\npotential obtained in χEFT calculations [25] which signiﬁ-\ncantly improves the agreement with available data.\nFor the K±–p interaction we employ the Jülich model [26,\n27] and we investigate the interplay between the Coulomb\nand the strong interaction in the correlation function.\nAt the moment, the limited amount of experimental data\nfor the /Lambda1–/Lambda1interaction do not allow to discriminate among\ndifferent potentials. In this paper we show that future femto-\nscopic analyses for the /Lambda1–/Lambda1correlation function performed\nwith CATS open the possibility to differentiate between dif-\nferent types of potentials.\nFor this pair, following the results presented in [ 28], we\nadopt four potentials: two versions of hard-core Nijmegen\nmodels (ND56 [ 29], NF50 [ 30]), a quark-model potential\nwith meson exchange effect included (fss2 [31]) and another\nhard-core Nijmegen potential NF42 [30] which allows for a\nbound state.\nThe ﬁrst three ones have been chosen since they deliver\nthe best agreement with the recent /Lambda1–/Lambda1STAR measure-\nments [12] while the latter has been selected since it is con-\nnected to a possible bound state and it shows a different\nbehavior as a function of the relative distance r between the\ntwo particles.\nFor p–/Xi1pairs we adopt the most recent potential obtained\nby the HAL QCD lattice collaboration [32,33].\n123\nEur. Phys. J. C (2018) 78 :394 Page 3 of 15 394\nThe most modern potentials can also be implemented in\nCATS, however this would require their transformation to\na local form, nevertheless this is beyond the scope of the\ncurrent study.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2.1 we intro-\nduce the formalism of the Schrödinger equation as embedded\nin the algorithm, while in Sect. 2.2 we introduce the inter-\naction potentials used for the later investigations of the p–p,\np–/Lambda1,K ( ¯K)–p, p–/Xi1\n− and /Lambda1–/Lambda1systems.\nIn Sect. 3 we show our results for the correlation func-\ntions of the above-mentioned pairs using different interaction\npotentials and source sizes. A comparison with the emitting\nsource obtained from the EPOS transport model is presented\nfor p–p and p– /Lambda1pairs. In addition we show results for p–\n/Xi1\n− and /Lambda1–/Lambda1correlation functions including experimental\neffects such as momentum resolution and feed-down decays.\nMoreover we present a comparison between the extracted\nsource radius for p–p pairs obtained from the HADES col-\nlaboration in p–Nb reactions at √\nsNN = 3.18 GeV and a\nCATS ﬁt of the same data.\nFinally in Sect. 4 we present conclusions and future out-\nlooks. In addition in Appendix A we provide technical infor-\nmation related to the installation of CATS and the numerical\nmethods used in the code.\n2C A T S\n2.1 Overview\nCATS is designed to compute the two-particle correlation\nfunction for any emission distribution and interaction poten-\ntial. This is achieved by numerically solving the Schrödinger\nequation (SE) and by evaluating the convolution of the result-\ning wave function with a source distribution (see Eq. (1)).\nThe two-particle stationary SE reads\n− ¯h\n2\n2μ∇2ψ + V ψ = Eψ, (2)\nwhere μ = m1m2\nm1+m2 is the reduced mass of the system.\nBy assuming a central interaction potential V , the total\nwave function is separated into a radial term and an angular\nterm given by the spherical harmonics\nψk (r,θ,φ) = Rk (r)Y m\nl (θ, φ). (3)\nIn particular the radial equation to be solved is\n− ¯h2\n2μ\nd2u\ndr2 +\n[\nV (r) + ¯h2\n2μ\nl(l + 1)\nr2\n]\nu = Eu , (4)\nwhere u(r) = rR (r).\nThe overall interaction potentialV (r) is the sum of a short\nrange strong contribution and a long range Coulomb poten-\ntial. Since we are looking for scattering states as a function\nof the relative momentum k and not for bound states, the\nenergy E of the system needs to be ﬁxed by using the rela-\ntion E =\n¯h2k2\n2μ . The scattered state will then approach the\nasymptotic solution outside the range of the strong potential\nleading to a free or a pure Coulomb wave function depending\non the charge of the particles involved.\nIn order to properly match the exact solution to the asymp-\ntotic form we have to evaluate the phase shifts of the corre-\nsponding wave function. For this purpose the SE is solved\nby expanding the total wave function in partial waves\nψ\nk (r,θ,φ) =\nlmax∑\nl=0\nRk,l (r)Y m\nl (θ, φ)\n=\nlmax∑\nl=0\nil (2l + 1)uk,l (r)\nr Pl (cos θ). (5)\nwhere Pl (cos θ) are the Legendre polynomials.\nThe sum over the partial waves runs until the convergence\nof the solution is reached, and from there we obtain the total\nwave function ψ\nk (r) to be used in Eq. (1).\nTaking into account the Fermi statistics of the particle pairs\nand ﬁxing the isospin ( I ) conﬁguration, only speciﬁc states\n2S+1 L J are allowed depending on the particle species, where\nwe use the standard spectroscopic notation with S denoting\nthe total spin, L the orbital angular momentum and J the\ntotal angular momentum of the pair. Moreover, since NN,\nnucleon–hyperon (NY), kaon–nucleon (KN) and hyperon–\nhyperon (YY) potentials might involve spin-orbit coupling\n¯L · ¯S, the total angular momentum ¯J = ¯L + ¯S has to be taken\nas a good quantum number to characterize the eigenstates\nand has to be accounted for in the total degeneracy of the\nstates.\nThe total correlation function that CATS provides as an\noutput is then given by\nC(k) =\n∑\nstates(I,S,L,J )\nw(I,S,L,J )C(I,S,L,J ), (6)\nwhere each C(I,S,L,J ) is evaluated by means of Eq. ( 1) and\nweighted by w(I,S,L,J ).\nIn experimental conditions with unpolarized particles we\nshould take into account the degeneracy inS,a sw e l la si nI .\nMoreover for L > 0 states also the degeneracy in J has to\nbe considered. How to compute the corresponding weights\nw\n(I,S,L,J ) is explained in Appendix A.\nIn CATS the source function is characterized in two ways.\nOne possibility is to deﬁne an analytical function which mod-\nels the emission source. It is typically based on a Gaussian\n123\n394 Page 4 of 15 Eur. Phys. J. C (2018) 78 :394\ndistribution of the x,y and z single particle coordinates. The\nemission source S(r,θ,φ) is deﬁned as the probability den-\nsity function (pdf) to emit a particle pair at a certain relative\ndistance r and relative polar and azimuthal angles θ and φ.\nFor an uncorrelated particle emission the Gaussian source\nreads\nS(r) = 1\n(4πr2\n0 )3/2 exp\n(\n− r2\n4r2\n0\n)\n, (7)\nwhere r0 is the size of the source. Since no angular depen-\ndence is involved, to obtain the probability of emitting two\nparticles at a distance r a trivial integration over the solid\nangle is necessary\nS\n4π(r) = 4πr2 S(r) = 4πr2\n(4πr2\n0 )3/2 exp\n(\n− r2\n4r2\n0\n)\n. (8)\nAnother possibility is to sample the relative distance between\nthe particle pairs directly from the output of an event gener-\nator such as EPOS.\nIn Fig. 1 we compare the shapes of differently sized Gaus-\nsian sources to the EPOS source for p–p pairs obtained in a\nsimulation of pp collisions at 7 TeV . Notably the EPOS source\npredicts that most of the particle pairs will be emitted at dis-\ntances below 2 fm, which is the typical range of the strong\ninteraction. Hence the asymptotic solution of the wave func-\ntion will no longer be valid in that region, highlighting the\nnecessity of an exact treatment of the problem. Moreover we\nsee that EPOS predicts a non-Gaussian source.\n2.2 NN and NY interaction potentials\nThe NN interaction has been widely constrained thanks\nto a large amount of scattering data along with data on\nbound states such as the deuteron [ 34]. In the common\nYukawa picture the NN potential is described by means of\nmodel-independent components as the long range One-Pion-\nExchange term (OPE) and the ππ exchange term for the\nintermediate attraction [35]. The vector meson (typically ω)\nexchange accounts for the repulsive core.\nThis repulsive contribution can be phenomenologically\nmodeled with a Woods–Saxon function.\nAll these features are included in the most common NN\npotentials such as Bonn [ 36,37], Urbana [ 38], Paris [ 39],\nNijmegen [40], Reid [ 21] and Argonne [ 23] potentials. In\naddition, the results obtained within a chiral effective ﬁeld\ntheory approach (χEFT) [41–45] and within the latest version\nof the Nijmegen model ESC08 [ 46] have to be mentioned,\nsince they provide similar results for the scattering parame-\nters and both models show a nice description of the available\ndata.\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\nδ (k) (deg)\nData \nAv18\nReid SC (CRAB) -20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\nδ (k) (deg)\n0 100 200 300 400\nk (MeV)\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\nδ (k) (deg)\n0 100 200 300 400\nk (MeV)\n-10\n0\n10\n20\nδ (k) (deg)\n1\nS0\n3\nP0\n3\nP1\n3\nP2\nFig. 2 Phase shifts as a function of the relative momentum k for the\np–p system using the Argonne v18 potential (blue solid line) and the\nReid SC potential as used in CRAB calculations (green dashed line).\nThe phase shifts are taken from [ 34]\nFor the study of the p–p correlation function in this paper\nwe employ the Argonne v18 [23] and the Reid Soft-Core\n(RSC) [21] potentials. The latter is the default choice in fem-\ntoscopic analyses [19,20]. In the Koonin model only the RSC\nsinglet state 1 S0 is considered, while in the CRAB calcula-\ntions also the triplet 3 P2 state is included but without spin-\norbit or tensor terms. Nevertheless, these terms are crucial\nin order to reproduce the\n3 P2 phase shift, as can be seen in\nFig. 2. Here the Argonne v18, which includes all s- and p-\nwave states and both the spin-orbit and tensor terms, results\nin a much better agreement with the partial wave data in the\nmomentum range we are interested in.\nIt should be noted that a more recent version of the RSC\npotential [47] is available. Nevertheless it is beyond the pur-\npose of the current work to study in details the subtle differ-\nences between a large variety of NN potentials, since we do\nnot expect a large discrepancy in the p–p correlation function.\nThe range of relative momentak relevant for femtoscopic\nstudies stops at k\nmax ≈ 200 MeV/c and the dominant con-\ntribution in the phase shifts in this regime is mainly coming\nfrom s- and p-wave states [34]. For this reason at the moment\nwe are neglecting the coupled channel to the\n3 F2 wave.\nUnfortunately in the nucleon–hyperon sector only 36 scat-\ntering data points have been measured [50–55] and the avail-\nable phenomenological potentials are ﬁtted in order to repro-\nduce these data along with the accessible hypernuclei binding\nenergies. In particular, for the p–/Lambda1interaction we adopt the\npotential introduced by Bodmer, Usmani, and Carlson [24],\nwhich reproduces the available cross section data as shown\nin Fig. 3. This potential is similar to a NN Argonne inter-\naction since it includes a repulsive Woods–Saxon core and\na two-pion intermediate exchange term. At the moment we\njust consider s-waves, which account for both the singlet1 S0\nand the triplet 3 S1 state.\n123\nEur. Phys. J.

In this work\nthe authors show that the agreement with the available data\nin the S =− 1 sector is considerably improved with respect\nto previous leading order results. A local potential for this\nmodel is not yet available, nevertheless we were provided\nwith the radial wave function and used CATS to compute\nthe resulting correlation functions for different sources. The\nscattering parameters of the two potentials used to model the\np–/Lambda1interaction are listed in Table 1.\nConcerning the S =− 2 sector the interaction of/Xi1hyper-\nons with nuclei is not well constrained experimentally or phe-\nnomenologically [56]. Recently a/Xi1-hypernucleus candidate\nhas been detected [ 57] and ongoing measurements suggest\nthat the N–/Xi1interaction is weakly attractive [58].\nRecent lattice QCD calculations from the HAL QCD col-\nlaboration showed preliminary results on the p–/Xi1\n− correla-\ntion function based on local potentials in the s-wave singlet\nand triplet states, both in I = 0 and I = 1 channels [32,33].\nThe interaction potentials have been obtained in (2 + 1)-\nﬂavor lattice QCD simulations close to the physical masses\nof pions and kaons. In particular in the isoscalar1 S0 channel\nit has been shown that the p–/Xi1− interaction is deeply attrac-\ntive at intermediate distances and relatively weakly repulsive\nat shorter distances. The isoscalar spin triplet state 3 S1 has a\nshallow attractive well and a very repulsive core.\nThe I = 1 channel does not present any attraction in the\nspin singlet state while a mildly attractive region enclosing a\nrepulsive inner core has been found in the spin triplet state.\nThese contributions might not be relevant for large source\nsizes [32] but could impact the overall correlation function for\nsmaller emitting sources as obtained in elementary collisions.\n2.3 KN and ¯KN interaction\nAs for the hyperon–nucleon case, the (anti)kaon–nucleon\nsystem is a powerful tool to study the short range strong\ninteraction with the exchange of strangeness as a new degree\nof freedom.\nIn particular kaons are suited to study the inner part of\nnuclei since at low energies they interact rather weakly with\nthe nucleons [ 56]. On the contrary antikaons scattering on\nnuclei is characterized by absorption processes that can lead\nto the production of hyperons such as /Lambda1and /Sigma1[56,59].\nThe understanding of the short range kaon–nucleon inter-\naction, already in vacuum, is fundamental to unveil more\ncomplicated systems such as quasi-bound states near thresh-\nold, kaonic atoms and kaonic clusters [60–66].\nFrom a theoretical point of view, based on the success-\nful description of the NN interaction, several meson-baryon\nexchange models, such as the Jülich model [ 26,27], have\nbeen applied so far in the description of the available KN\ndata. In this approach the short range repulsion in K\n+-N is\nnot well reproduced by the simple presence of the ω meson.\nIn order to reproduce the s-wave scattering parameters an\nadditional repulsive contribution is needed. The inclusion of\nspin-dependent terms, such as one gluon exchange (OGE)\nor exchange of the scalar-isovector mesona(980), improves\nthe agreement in the s-channel [67].\nIt is also worth mentioning that different theoretical\napproaches based on quark models [68–70] and χEFT inter-\nactions [ 71] have also been used to investigate the kaon–\nnucleon interaction.\nIn this work we adopted the above mentioned Jülich\nmodel, which besides single particle exchange terms also\ncontains box diagrams allowing for intermediate states such\nas N,/Delta1,K( ¯K),K\n∗( ¯K∗). A local potential was not available\nfor this model, nevertheless we were provided with the exact\nsolution of the radial wave function, which was included in\nCATS for the computation of the correlation function.\nBesides the wave function corresponding to the strong\nK( ¯K)–N interaction potential, we also take into account the\nCoulomb interaction in an approximate way by multiplying\nthe (strong) wave function with the Gamow factorA\nc(η) [13]\n123\n394 Page 6 of 15 Eur.

A more\nelaborate approximation based on the renormalization of the\nasymptotic behaviour of the strong wave function has been\ndeveloped in the past [72] and will be used in future analyses.\n2.4 YY interaction\nIn the YY sector the available experimental data on the\nbinding energy of /Lambda1/Lambda1hypernuclei, despite recent data on\n6\n/Lambda1/Lambda1He [73,74], do not allow to set tight constraints on the\nnature of the underlying interaction [56].\nRecently the STAR collaboration employed the fem-\ntoscopy technique to study /Lambda1–/Lambda1correlations in Au-Au col-\nlisions at √sNN = 200 GeV [12]. The reported shallow repul-\nsive interaction in this work is still under debate, since in an\nalternative analysis, that considered the contribution of the\nresiduals in a more sophisticated way, a shallow attractive\ninteraction was conﬁrmed [28]. One of the goals of this work\nis to show that a detailed study of the/Lambda1–/Lambda1correlation func-\ntion might be a sensitive tool to extract information on the\ninteraction of the two particles.\nFor this purpose, we select four different potentials: three\nmeson-exchange Nijmegen models with a short range hard-\nc o r e( N D 5 6[29], NF50 and NF42 [30]) and one quark-model\npotential which includes meson exchange effects as well\n(fss2 [31]). The models ND56, NF50 and fss2 deliver the\nbest agreement with the /Lambda1–/Lambda1correlation data measured by\nSTAR. The NF42 has been chosen to show the sensitivity of\nthe correlation function to the presence of a possible bound\nstate, which is allowed by this potential.\nThe above mentioned potentials have been translated in a\nlocal form by using a two-range Gaussian parametrization,\nfollowing the approach used in [28]\nV\n/Lambda1/Lambda1(r) = v1e−r2/μ2\n1 + v2e−r2/μ2\n2 .

In\nparticular two different transport models are used to model\nthe source: UrQMD [ 75] for simulating p–Nb reactions at√\nsNN = 3.18 GeV and EPOS [ 18] for simulating pp reac-\ntions at √s = 7 TeV . The p–Nb system is expected to have\na Gaussian source of around 2 fm [76], while the pp system\nproduces a much smaller source, comparable to a Gaussian\nsource of below 1 fm (see Fig.1). As already pointed out the\nCRAB tool provides only an approximate solution at small\ndistances. Figure 5 shows that in the case of the larger source\n(the p–Nb system) the two models are in agreement within\nfew percent. However for pp collisions at 7 TeV the source is\nmuch smaller and consequently a much larger discrepancy, of\nup to 20%, is observed between CRAB and the exact CATS\nsolution.\n123\nEur. Phys. J.

The proﬁle of the\nresulting correlation functions reproduce the main features\ncoming from the interplay between the attractive part of the\nNN potential and the short-range repulsive core along with\ncontributions from Coulomb and Fermi-Dirac statistics. The\nrepulsive interaction is visible between 60 < k < 200 MeV\nsince C(k) is below unity. This effect is enhanced for smaller\nsources.\nThe strength of the p–p correlation signal increases by\nalmost a factor 2.5 going from r\n0 = 2f mt o r0 = 0.85 fm.\nThe differences among the potentials are negligible for most\nof the source sizes. Nevertheless it is evident that for sources\nbelow 1 fm deviations up to 10% are present atk > 150 MeV .\nThe p– /Lambda1pair is neither affected by Coulomb interac-\ntion nor by quantum statistics. As a result the shape of\nthe corresponding correlation function C(k) is only affected\nby the strong interaction potential. Here results are shown\nfor the Usmani potential and the χEFT NLO potential (see\n123\n394 Page 8 of 15 Eur. Phys. J.

Both of these potentials possess a phenomenolog-\nical repulsive core which is dominated by an intermediate\nattraction ask decreases. This results in a rise ofC(k)at lower\nmomenta. The two potentials produce very similar correla-\ntion functions and the differences are mostly associated with\nthe slightly more attractive3 S1 state in the Usmani potential.\nThis can be easily understood by comparing the scattering\nparameters (see Table1) of the Usmani and the chiral poten-\ntial. While the scattering lengths in the singlet state are almost\nidentical, they do differ in the triplet state, where the Usmani\npotential is slightly more attractive, resulting in an enhanced\ncorrelation.\nIn addition for the NLO correlation function we compare\nthe exact solution to the approximate Lednický model. As\nexpected we observe a signiﬁcant deviation between the exact\nand approximate solution at small source radii. The Lednický\nmodel produces an enhanced correlation signal because it\ncontains the NLO scattering parameters that account only\nfor the average attractive interaction. On the contrary the\ncorrelation function obtained feeding the exact NLO wave\nfunction in CATS shows the repulsive component expected\nwithin this model.\nIt is clear that for sources ≥ 2 fm the correlation function\nis not sensitive to the repulsive core both for p–p and p– /Lambda1\npairs. However, in the case of smaller sources, as shown in\nthe last panel of Fig. 6, the correlation functions split up and\nremain different even for relative momenta k > 150 MeV .\nThis region is commonly used in femtoscopy analyses as a\ncorrelation free baseline to which the overall normalization\nof C(k) is applied. Due to to the possible non-ﬂat correlation\nin that region particular care has to be considered in including\nthe correct potential in the correlation function.\nIn Fig. 7 the emitting source has been directly taken from\nthe EPOS model simulating pp collisions at √\ns = 7T e V .\nIn this transport code the evaluated source peaks at very low\ndistances and has a long tail, as already shown in Fig.1. More-\nover the EPOS source presents a non-trivial angular depen-\ndence of the emission source. The sources for both the p–p\nand p–/Lambda1systems in EPOS are the same. However, if a Gaus-\nsian parametrization is employed to reproduce the correlation\nfunctions obtained with EPOS, different source sizes r\n0 for\nboth systems are needed. This suggests that when investigat-\ning experimental baryon-baryon correlations in small sys-\ntems, particular care has to be taken in the assumption of the\nproﬁle of the emitting source.\nResults for K\n−–p and K +–p correlations for different\nsource sizes are shown in the upper and lower panel of Fig.8.\nThe correlation function including only the Coulomb interac-\ntion is plotted in order to see the effect of the strong potential.\nThe K−–p correlation function is deeply affected by the\nstrong interaction already at k ≈ 200 MeV and it dominates\nthe lowk region. As expected both these effects are enhanced\nwhen the source gets smaller.\nThe opposite scenario is depicted for the K +–p pair,\nwhere the Coulomb and the strong repulsion lead to an anti-\ncorrelated signal at low momenta.\nIn Fig. 9 we show the expected theoretical p–/Xi1− correla-\ntion function. We compare C(k) for a pure Coulomb inter-\naction with the correlation function including the prelimi-\nnary strong potential from the HAL QCD collaboration. The\nincluded channels are the (I = 0, S = 0), (I = 0, S = 1),\n(I = 1, S = 0) and (I = 1, S = 1), where only s-waves are\nconsidered. There is a clear enhancement of the correlation\nsignal at small relative momenta k, which is a result of the\nattractive I = 0 channel. This effect is further increased for\nsmall emitting sources.\nIn Fig.10 we present results for/Lambda1–/Lambda1analysis with several\ninteraction potentials (see Sect. 2.4). As a comparison the\ncorrelation function obtained only with the quantum statistics\nincluded is presented. The latter is responsible for the limit\nvalue C(k) = 0.5 as the relative momentum k tends to zero.\nThe correlation function shows a strong sensitivity to\nthe interaction potential and moreover the shape of C(k)\nis deeply affected by the source size.

The weakly attractive potentials, NF50\nand fss2, also show an enhancement compared to the quan-\ntum statistics baseline, nevertheless the correlation signal\nis much weaker due to the presence of a large repulsive\ncore.\nWhen making predictions about the correlation function\nit is important to take into account the expected experimental\nlimitations. In particular the momentum resolution and the\nresidual correlations contributing to the femtoscopic signal\ncan distort the correlation function [77].

To\nobtain a solution valid for any source size CATS solves the\nSchrödinger equation exactly, thus providing the possibility\nto investigate not only heavy-ion reactions but small collision\nsystems as well.\nIn the present work we show the theoretical correlation\nfunctions for the p–p, p–/Lambda1,K ( ¯K)–p, p–/Xi1\n− and /Lambda1–/Lambda1particle\npairs, by using different models for the interaction potential.\nA comparison between CATS and CRAB reveals that\nfor an emitting source of around 2 fm the correlation func-\ntions are quite similar. Nevertheless, for small colliding sys-\ntems, such as pp at TeV energies, the exact treatment of the\nSchrödinger equation strongly deviates from the approximate\nsolution of CRAB. Thus CATS provides a unique opportunity\nto investigate the short-range interaction between particles in\nsmall systems.\nWe show that both the p–p and p–/Lambda1correlation functions\nare affected by the repulsive core of their interaction poten-\ntials, which is mostly evident for small emitting sources. This\neffect is particularly relevant for momenta above 100 MeV ,\nwhere the exact solution deviates signiﬁcantly compared to\napproximate models like Lednický.\nMoreover for the p–p and p–/Lambda1correlations we test differ-\nent emission sources by using the EPOS transport model. In\nFig. 1 we show that the emitting source provided by EPOS\nis completely different from the traditionally Gaussian form\nused so far in femtoscopic analyses. The results presented\nhere suggest the need for a more detailed analysis of the pro-\nﬁle of the emitting source beyond the traditional Gaussian\nparametrization, whenever dealing with small systems.\nThe investigation of the K ( ¯K)–p correlation function\nshows a relevant modiﬁcation due to the strong interaction.\nThis effect increases with a decreasing source size.\nThe p–/Xi1\n− correlation function is calculated by employ-\ning a preliminary local potential obtained from recent lat-\ntice HAL QCD results. We observe that for small emitting\nsources, as expected in pp collision systems, the strong inter-\naction modiﬁes the correlation function signiﬁcantly. This\nimplies that future experimental femtoscopic data on the p–\n/Xi1\n− correlation should be sensitive to this effect. This state-\nment is still valid if one includes momentum resolution cor-\nrections and residual effects in the correlation function.\nFor the /Lambda1–/Lambda1correlation function we show results for\ndifferent interaction potentials, based on Nijmegen boson-\nexchange models and quark models. Starting from source\nsizes of r\n0 = 2 fm, the corresponding C(k) shows a rele-\nvant sensitivity to the strong potentials. As the source radius\ndecreases the correlation function is modiﬁed by the attrac-\ntive contribution common to all of the above-mentioned\npotentials. We also show that the inclusion of the expected\nexperimental effects makes the separation of the different\npotentials extremely challenging and will require a lot of\nstatistics.\nCATS was designed such that it can easily be used with an\nexternal ﬁtter. To demonstrate this we perform a reﬁt of the p–\np correlation function measured by the HADES experiment\nin p–Nb reactions at√\nsNN = 3.18 GeV . The obtained results\nare in a perfect agreement with the published data.\nThe experimental database of femtoscopy is constantly\ngrowing, thus in the near future it will be essential to per-\nform global analyses over all available data in order to get\nthe best possible constraints on the interaction potentials.\nThe ﬂexibility of CATS allows it to be used as the base of\nmore complex frameworks and is therefore ready to fulﬁll\nthe requirements of the upcoming experimental analyses.\nAcknowledgements The authors are grateful to Dr. Stefano Gandolﬁ,\nProf. Johann Haidenbauer, Prof. Tetsuo Hatsuda, Prof. Norbert Kaiser,\nProf. Kenji Morita and Prof. Wolfram Weise for the stimulating dis-\ncussions and the useful contributions to the work presented here.

In this section\nsection we would like to discuss some of the technical details\nregarding the working principles of CATS. All information\nrefers to CATS version 2.7, any future changes will be marked\nin the release notes.\nThe CATS software package contains basic examples\nhighlighting the main input parameters that the user needs\nto set up in their code. Those include the basic properties of\nthe particle pair, e.g. reduced mass, charges etc. We would\n123\n394 Page 12 of 15 Eur. Phys. J. C (2018) 78 :394\nlike to focus on the two most important inputs, namely the\nemission source and the interaction potential.\nAppendix A.1: The source function\nCommonly the source function is considered to have only\nr dependence, r being the relative distance between the\ntwo particles. However CATS uses a more generic deﬁni-\ntion which allows an additional dependence on the relative\nmomentum k and the scattering angle θ = ∢ (r,k).T h e\nspeciﬁc implementation of the source and its parameters in\nCATS allows to link it to an external framework to perform\ndata-ﬁtting (see Fig. 12).\nAlternately the source can be inserted into CATS from an\nOSCAR 1997 A ﬁle [79]. This format is commonly used by\ntransport codes in relativistic heavy ion collisions and it con-\ntains event-by-event information about the position and the\nmomentum four-vectors of all particles produced in the simu-\nlation. Note that obtaining the source from simulations leads\nto statistical uncertainties which result in a limited precision\nwhen determining the source function. Thus CATS also com-\nputes the uncertainty associated with the source function and\npropagates it to the correlation function.\nAppendix A.2: Computing the wave function\nThe heart of CATS is the numerical solver for computing\nthe wave function. The two body problem can be reduced\nto a one-body problem simply by using the reduced mass\nμ = (m\n1m2)/(m1 +m2)and the reduced relative momentum\nk = 1\n2 |p1 − p2|, where p1 and p2 are the momenta of the\ntwo particles evaluated in their center of mass (CM) frame\nof reference.\nTo obtain the SE solution we follow the standard proce-\ndure of separation of variables and partial waves decomposi-\ntion (Eq. (A.1)) information on which, including the standard\nnotation, can be found in any quantum mechanics textbook\n(e.g. [80])\nψ\nk (r) = Rk (r)Y (θ) =\nlmax∑\nl=0\nRk,l (r)Yl (θ)\n=\nlmax∑\nl=0\nil (2l + 1)Rk,l (r)Pl (cosθ). (A.1)\nFor low-energy problems, as the one at hand, this series\nconverges quite fast. The Legendre polynomials Pl are eas-\nily computed using the GNU scientiﬁc library (GSL) [ 81],\nhence the only thing left to evaluate is the radial wave func-\ntion Rk,l (r), which satisﬁes the radial Schrödinger equation\n(RSE)\nd2uk,l (r)\ndr2 =\n[ 2μVI,s,l,j (r)\n¯h2 + l(l + 1)\nr2 − k2\n]\nuk,l (r),\n(A.2)\nwhere uk,l (r) = rR k,l (r) and VI,s,l,j (r) is the interaction\npotential between the particle species of interest. As marked\nby the subindices the potential can depend on all quantum\nnumbers describing the pair and consequently the solutions\nfor the radial wave functions will differ between the differ-\nent states. How to combine the different solutions to obtain\nthe ﬁnal correlation function will be explained at the end of\nthis subsection, but ﬁrst let us turn the focus to solving the\nSchrödinger equation for ﬁxed values of k, I , s, l and j.\nTo avoid the overuse of indices, the radial wave functions\nu\nk,l (r), Rk,l (r) and the potentialVI,s,l,j (r) will be written as\nu(r), R(r) and V (r) respectively. In order to solve Eq. (A.2)\nnumerically we employed a simple Euler-method equipped\nwith an adaptive grid which automatically adjusts its step\nsize when computing u(r). The basic idea is to make the\nstep smaller when computing regions of the wave function\nthat have a strong non-linear behavior, i.e. a large second\nderivative. The discretized version of Eq. ( A.2)u s i n gt h e\nEuler method and a dynamic step size reads\nu\ni+1 = ui\n(\n1 + Δi\nΔi−1\n)\n− ui−1\nΔi\nΔi−1\n+ Fi ui Δ2\ni  \n≈const\n, (A.3)\nwith\nFi =\n[ 2μV (r)\n¯h2 + l(l + 1)\nr2 − k2\n]\n, (A.4)\nwhere ui is the value of u(r) at the i-th point on the discrete\nr-grid, Δi = ri+1 − ri is the distance on the grid to the next\nevaluation point. The relation u′′\ni = Fi ur is given by com-\nbining Eqs. (A.2) and (A.4), thus in order to adjust the step\nsize one could simply keep the last term in Eq. (A.3) constant.\nThis ensures that Δ2\ni ∝ 1/u′′\ni and the non-linear increase of\nui+1 is kept constant throughout the computation. We have\nexplored the possibility to select a more sophisticated numer-\nical method, e.g. a Numerov method. However the inclusion\nof an adaptive grid tends to become quite complicated for\nhigher-order numerical solvers. We have found out that the\nEuler method with an adaptive provides a faster solution,\nwithout compromising accuracy or precision, compared to\nthe Numerov method without an adaptive grid. For this rea-\nson we have decided to employ the former.\nOne additional problem that arises when solving the\nSchrödinger equation is related to the boundary conditions.\nIn particular Eq. (A.3) can be used to get the full wave func-\ntion only if the ﬁrst two points u\n0,1 are known. Note that\nu(r) = rR (r), hence u(0) = u0 = 0 can be used as the\nstarting point of the solver. However the second point of the\nwave function depends on the potential and is thus a priori\nnot known. Nevertheless if the second point u\n1 is chosen\nrandomly Eq. ( A.3) will still yield the correct shape of the\nwave function at the expense of a wrong absolute normaliza-\n123\nEur. Phys. J. C (2018) 78 :394 Page 13 of 15 394\nFig. 13 An example for the\nCATS input when both the s-\nand p-wave interactions are\nincluded. There are four distinct\ninteraction channels:\nψ\n0 = ψ1S0 + ψ1P1 + ...,\nψ1 = ψ3S1 + ψ3P0 + ...,\nψ2 = ψ3S1 + ψ3P1 + ... and\nψ3 = ψ3S1 + ψ3P2 + ....T h e\ndots represent all partial waves\nbeyond the p-wave, which are\nassumed to have no inﬂuence on\nC(k) and are thus considered\nirrelevant. The grayed out states\nare not allowed in the case of\np–p correlation, but can be\nincluded if needed, e.g. for p–/Lambda1\ncorrelations\nTotal spin 1\nWeight 3/4\nTotal spin 0\nWeight 1/4\nChannel 0 Channel 1 Channel 2 Channel 3\ntion. To obtain the correct normalization a second boundary\ncondition is needed.\nA straightforward approach to overcome this issue is to\nuse the asymptotic solution. For a short range interaction\npotential V (r), the evolution of the asymptotic wave function\nis governed by a phase shifted free or Coulomb wave. CATS\nis able to check when the solution has reached its asymptotic\nregion and then simply match the numerical solution to the\nasymptotic one. This procedure allows to determine not only\nthe normalization of u(r) but the phase shift of the potential\nV (r) as well (see Fig. 2). The total wave function ψ\nk (r) is\ngiven by the sum over all l partial waves\nψk (r) =\nlmax∑\nl=0\nψk,l (r) =\nln∑\nl=0\nψk,l (r)\n  \nnumerical\n+\nlmax∑\nl=ln +1\nψk,l (r)\n  \nasymptotic\n. (A.5)\nHere the value of lmax is determined by the condition for\nconvergence, namely when l > lmax the partial waves are\npractically zero in the asymptotic range. The sum is then split\nin two parts – ﬁrst all numerically evaluated partial waves are\nsummed up and than all remaining partial waves are added\nusing their asymptotic solution obtained from GSL.\nAnother important thing to consider is the possibility to\nhave different spin and isospin states. Moreover since the\ntotal angular momentum J is a good quantum number for\npotentials with spin-orbit terms, the degeneracy in J has to\nbe taken into account as well. All of these contributions will\nresult in different partial wave states\n2S+1 L J and the user\nshould provide CATS with all relevant information in order\nto get a correct total correlation function. The way this is\nachieved is by introducing the notation of interaction chan-\nnels (see Fig. 13). An interaction channel is deﬁned as the\ntotal wave function for a speciﬁc spin and isospin state and\neach partial wave that is included in the computation is con-\nsidered to be in a ﬁxed J state. The user should carefully\nexamine all possible permutations to include each channel\nthat contributes to the ﬁnal correlation and should provide\nCATS with the probabilities that the particle pair can be found\nin particular channel.\nWe provide an example for the p–p interaction. For this\nsystem the isospin can only be 1, hence it is not considered\nin the calculation. However the total spinS of the system can\nbe either 0 or 1. Since those states correspond to a singlet\nand a triplet conﬁguration respectively, as long as there is no\npreferred polarization the probability to be in the singlet state\nis 1/4 and in the triplet 3/4. Those weights can be computed\nfrom the simple formula regarding spin degeneracy\nw\n(S) = (2S + 1)\n(2s1 + 1)(2s2 + 1), (A.6)\nwhere s1 and s2 are the spins of the individual particles. If\none would consider only the s-waves in the computation the\nrelevant partial waves are 1 S0 and 3 S1. In fact for p–p, due\nto the quantum statistics of identical fermions, the 3 S1 state\nis not allowed and therefore no potential will be considered\nin CATS. Nevertheless it is very important to note that the\nw e i g h t so f1/4 and 3 /4 still need to be set, since even if\nthe 3 S1 partial wave is canceled out for p–p, the total wave\nfunction of the S = 1 is still included in C(k) with a ﬂat\ncontribution. The situation becomes a bit more complex if\nthe p-waves are to be considered as well. In the S = 0t h e\n1 P1 is the only p-partial wave and for p–p it is canceled out\nagain due to the quantum statistics. However theS = 1 state\nhas 3 possible p-waves, namely 3 P0, 3 P1 and 3 P2. These\nstates have the sameS and L quantum numbers, but different\nJ . Hence to compute their relative contributions one needs\nto consider the degeneracy in J which is given by\nw(J ) = (2J + 1)\n(2L + 1)(2S + 1). (A.7)\n123\n394 Page 14 of 15 Eur. Phys. J. C (2018) 78 :394\nThe total weights will be given by:\nw(S,L,J ) = w(S) · w(J ) = (A.8)\n(2S + 1)\n(2s1 + 1)(2s2 + 1)\n(2J + 1)\n(2L + 1)(2S + 1). (A.9)\nIn Fig. 13 we show a schematic representation of the above\nexample.\nFrom the user’s perspective, the inputs that CATS has to\nbe provided with are the number of interaction channels,\nthe number of partial waves to be included in each channel\nand ﬁnally the potentials for each partial wave state. In the\nexample from Fig. 13 the user needs to deﬁne 4 channels\neach containing two partial waves. However, due to the Pauli\nblocking, the\n1 P1 and 3 S1 states can be safely left undeﬁned\nin the code.\nReferences\n1. S. Pratt, Phys. Rev.
