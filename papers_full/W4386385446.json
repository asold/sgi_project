  "abstract": "The study addresses the potential benefits for companies of adopting ChatGPT, a popular chatbot built on a large-scale transformer-based language model known as a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT). Chatbots like ChatGPT may improve customer service, handle several client inquiries at once, and save operational costs. Moreover, ChatGPT may automate regular processes like order tracking and billing, allowing human employees to focus on more complex and strategic responsibilities. Nevertheless, before deploying ChatGPT, enterprises must carefully analyze its use cases and restrictions, as well as its strengths and disadvantages. ChatGPT, for example, requires training data that is particular to the business domain and might produce erroneous and ambiguous findings. The study identifies areas of deployment of ChatGPT's possible benefits in enterprises by drawing on the literature that is currently accessible on ChatGPT, massive language models, and artificial intelligence. Then, using the PSI (Preference Selection Index) and COPRAS (Complex Proportional Assessment) approaches, potential advantages are taken into account and prioritized. By highlighting current trends and possible advantages in the industry, this editorial seeks to provide insight into the present state of employing ChatGPT in enterprises and research. ChatGPT may also learn biases from training data and create replies that reinforce those biases. As a result, enterprises must train and fine-tune ChatGPT to specific operations, set explicit boundaries and limitations for its use, and implement appropriate security measures to avoid malicious input. The study highlights the research gap in the dearth of literature by outlining ChatGPT's potential benefits for businesses, analyzing its strengths and limits, and offering insights into how organizations might use ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance their operations.",
