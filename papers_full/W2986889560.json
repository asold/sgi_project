The lac k of appropriate diagnostics for the evaluation of AFI leads to\nincreased morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings, specifically low-income countries like India. The review\naimed to identify the number, type and quality of diagnosti cs used for AFI evaluation during passive case detection at\nhealth care centres in South India.\nMethods:A scoping review of peer-reviewed English language ori ginal research articles published between 1946-July\n2018 from four databases was undertaken to assess the type a nd number of diagnostics used in AFI evaluation in South\nIndia. Results were stratified according to types o f pathogen-specific tests used in AFI management.\nResults:The review included a total of 40 studies, all conducted i n tertiary care centres (80% in private settings). The\nstudies demonstrated the use of 5 –22 tests per patient for the evaluation of A FI. Among 25 studies evaluating possible\ncauses of AFI, 96% tested for malaria fo llowed by 80% for dengue, 72% for scrub typhus, 68% for typhoid and 60% for\nleptospirosis identifying these as commonly suspected causes of AFI. 54% studies diagnosed malaria with smear\nmicroscopy while others diagnosed dengue, scrub typhus, typhoid and leptospirosis using antibody or antigen\ndetection assays. 39% studies used the Weil-Felix test (W FT) for scrub typhus diagnosis and 82% studies used the\nWidal test for diagnosing typhoid.\nConclusions: The review demonstrated the use of five or more pathogen-specific tests in evaluating AFI as well\nas described the widespread use of suboptimal tests like the WFT and Widal in fever evaluation. It identified the\nneed for the development of better-quality tests for aetio logical diagnosis and improved standardised testing\nguidelines for AFI.\nKeywords: Fever, Acute febrile illness, Malaria, Scrub typhus, Dengue, Diagnostics, Tests, Diagnostic tests, Infectious\ndiseases, Typhoid, Leptospirosis\nBackground\nFever in the tropics is a nebulous terminology. Due to\nthe myriad clinical manifestations of fever, it is often\nbroadly classified based on the duration of symptoms\ninto: AFI and chronic fevers. As there is no consensus\ndefinition for the terms, chronic fever describes fevers\nlasting more than 14 – 21 days while AFI defines fevers\nlasting less than 21 days in duration as described in some\npublications [ 1]. AFI is synonymous with acute undiffer-\nentiated febrile Illness (AUFI), defined as: fevers resolving\nin 3 weeks lacking any localizable organ-specific signs or\nsymptoms [ 2– 4]. AFIs are often caused by infectious\ndiseases in tropical, low-resource settings that have the\nhighest burden of febrile illness [ 5– 7].\nFurther, AFI can be classified based on aetiology as\nfever caused by malaria and non- malarial acute febrile\nillness (NMAFI) caused by other pathogens.

BMC Infectious Diseases          (2019) 19:970 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4589-8\nworld has led to the development of high-quality point-\nof-care testing (POCT) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT)\nthat aid in early diagnosis and timely therapeutic manage-\nment of this illness. These developments have unmasked\nthe under-recognized burden of NMAFI [ 1, 8– 10].\nAFI is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in\nchildren and adults in low and middle-income countries\n[11]. Aetiology of febrile illness in South Asia is reported\nto be caused principally by scrub typhus, dengue, mal-\naria, typhoid and leptospirosis [ 2, 4, 6, 12– 16]. India is a\nlower middle-income country (LMIC), with approxi-\nmately 70% of its population living in rural areas [ 17].\nDue to India ’s geographical and seasonal heterogeneity,\nthe lack of comprehensive surveillance, non-specific\nsyndrome-based guidelines for fever management [ 18]\nand the lack of good-quality diagnostic tests, AFIs are\npoorly managed. In addition, due to the lax implementa-\ntion of policies on prescription-based sales of antimicro-\nbial agents, these are available cheaply leading to their\nextensive overuse, thus facilitating the development of\nantimicrobial resistance [ 19, 20]. In 2015, high-income\ncountries (HIC) like the United States, France and Italy\ndemonstrated a marginal increase in antibiotic consump-\ntion unlike the three leading middle-income countries -\nIndia, China and Pakistan that showed a drastic rise in anti-\nbiotic consumption. India surpassed China and Pakistan\nwith an increase from 3.3 billion defined daily doses (DDD)\nof antibiotic consumption in 2000 to 6.5 billion DDD in\n2015 (103%) compared to 79 and 65% increase in antibiotic\nconsumption in China and Pakistan respectively [ 21].\n51– 69% patients diagnosed with dengue in Chennai,\nwho do not require antibiotics, were prescribed anti-\nmicrobial therapy-mostly cephalosporins and fluoro-\nquinolones [ 12].\nTo gain a better understanding of the available and\nutilized tests in the Indian health system, this review\nintended to identify the diagnostic panel used for man-\naging AFIs at health care centres of all levels in India.\nThe objectives of this review were to identify the tests\ncommonly used for the diagnostic evaluation and assess-\nment of AFIs in patients attending for clinical care and\nto identify the number of diagnostic tests done per pa-\ntient suffering from AFI. This is scoping review that\naims to highlight the gaps in our understanding of AFI\ndiagnosis and management from the available literature\non AFI evaluation. The outcome of this study aims to\nemphasize diagnostic development needs as well as pol-\nicy/guidelines and interventions that can support AFI\ndiagnosis.\nMethods\nA concept note was initially prepared outlining the key\nobjectives, selection criteria and expected outcomes of\nthe study. Based on this a search strategy was created\nand articles were screened for eligibility. The screening,\nassessment and data synthesis was done by DB. In case\nof challenging articles, it was discussed with SD to de-\ncide for article inclusion or exclusion. Both DB and SD\nwere involved in the interpretation and analysis of data.\nThe key variables assessed in all studies were:\nTypes of AFI investigated\nType of diagnostic tests used for AFI evaluation\nThe number of diagnostic tests used per patient in\nreaching a diagnosis of aetiology of AFI\nThe setting of the studies: Public or private sector\nSelection criteria for publications\nCase definition\nFor this review, any publication describing patients at-\ntending health care facilities with fever of acute onset\n(≤ 3 weeks duration), were included.\nStudy design\nPeer-reviewed published literature describing diagnostic\ntests used for evaluation of AFI in patient care in South\nIndia which included: Cross-sectional studies, case-\ncontrol studies, case reports and case-series.\nType of publications\nOriginal research papers reporting AFI management in\nSouth India were included. Publications like reviews,\nmathematical models, articles on nosocomial infections/\nfevers, letters to the editor, short communications, con-\nference abstracts and short notes were excluded.\nPatient and setting characteristics\nPatients of all age groups presenting with symptoms of\nAFI were included. As India is a large heterogeneous\ncountry, the review focused on the southern region of\nIndia that includes the states of Karnataka (KA), Andhra\nPradesh (AP), Telangana (TS), Kerala (KE) and Tamil\nNadu (TN). These included patients attending the Out-\nPatient Department (OPD) or emergency care department\nor patients admitted in tertiary care settings like inpatient\ndepartments (IPD) or intensive care units (ICU). Patients\nattending primary or community health centers based in\nrural, urban, public and private health care settings in\nSouth India were included.\nDiagnostic tests in use\nDiagnostic tests can be broadly classified into pathogen-\nspecific and pathogen-nonspecific tests. Pathogen-specific\ntests provide an aetiological diagnosis of AFI. The types of\npathogen-specific tests can be further categorized into\nantigen or antibody detection assays, molecular tech-\nniques of nucleic acid detection, and phenotypic tests for\nBhaskaran et al. BMC Infectious Diseases          (2019) 19:970 Page 2 of 14\npathogen detection (e.g. smear microscopy for malaria,\nblood culture etc.)\nAssessment of publications that documented the type,\nand number of pathogen-specific diagnostics used for\nevaluation, monitoring and prognosis of AFI were done.\nSearch strategy\nFour electronic databases- E mbase (1946), Medline (1946),\nPubMed (1996) and IndMED (1985) were searched for\nEnglish language publications up to 13th July 2018. The\ndatabases were searched from their respective inception\nyears to note the evolution in th e types of diagnostic tools\nused for AFI diagnosis and to obtain maximum number of\npublications for analysis for this review. Three main search\nconcepts were used: acute feve r, diagnostic tests and India.\nSynonyms of fever like pyrexia, febrile illness were used.\nIndividual causes of AFI were al so inserted as search terms,\ne.g. scrub typhus, dengue etc. Similarly, synonyms for diag-\nnostic tests like point of care testing, bedside testing etc.\nwere used. Each term was searched as a keyword and\nMESH term. All the synonyms were connected by the\nBoolean operator OR. Truncation was used for terms like\ndiagnosis and testing: diagnos* and test*. Each major con-\ncept was connected by the Boolean operator AND. Free\ntext searching, manual hand -searching of journals and\nsnowballing methods were used to obtain additional articles\nfitting the selection criteria o f the review (Additional file 1:\nTable S1).\nData collection and extraction\nThe results of each search were exported to Endnote\nreference manager. Duplicates were removed. Full-text\narticles of potentially relevant studies were obtained, and\nstudies included for the review were identified using the\nselection criteria. Data extraction was done using an\nadaptation of the Cochrane Effective Practice and\nOrganization of Care (EPOC) data extraction form [ 22].\nQuality assessment\nThis review appraised cross-sectional and case-control\nstudies, case-series and case reports. Cross-sectional\nstudies were appraised using the AXIS critical appraisal\ntool [ 23], while case-control studies, case-series and case\nreports were appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute\nReviewer’s manual (JBI tool) [ 24].\nData synthesis\nA narrative synthesis was prepared using the data of the\nstudies to describe type and number of diagnostics used\nin AFI evaluation. Descriptive and analytical statistics\n(Additional file 1: Supplementary data) of laboratory\nprofiles of certain causes of AFI were reported. From the\nuse of diagnostics, the commonly suspected pathogens\nof AFI were documented.\nResults\nDescription of studies\nIn total, 7140 records with duplicates, were identified\nfrom four electronic databases and other methods. Based\non title of the article, 7016 were excluded. Broadly,\ndescriptive studies that documented the diagnostic\napproach to AFI and individual causes of AFI were in-\ncluded. Articles on comparative studies of different diag-\nnostic tools for individual causes of AFI, or exclusively\netiological studies of AFI, or AFI outbreak studies that\nonly used a single test to confirm a pathogen were ex-\ncluded. Etiological studies and outbreak studies that doc-\numented the diagnostic approach to AFI were included.\n124 articles were analysed using abstracts from which 54\narticles were excluded based on publication type (confer-\nence abstract, letter to the editor, short notes, short\ncommunications), setting (studies conducted in states\nother than KE, TN, KA, AP, TS). Seven studies were ir-\nretrievable despite sending emails to the authors or\nusing library resources. From 63 articles considered for\neligibility, 23 studies [ 3, 25– 46] were excluded with rea-\nsons as summarised in ‘Characteristics of excluded stud-\nies’ (Additional file 1: Table S4). Totally, 40 studies were\neligible for the review (Fig. 1).\nStudy design, location and setting of studies\nOf the 40 studies included for the review, 26 (65%) were\ncross-sectional studies [ 2, 16, 48– 71], one (2.5%) was a\ncase-control study [ 72], four (10%) were case series\n[73– 76], and nine (22.5%) were case reports [ 77– 85].\nAll studies were undertaken in tertiary care settings\nand were published between 2000 and 2018.\nAmong the 26 cross-sectional studies, four studies\nwere retrospective cross-sectional studies, one study was\na retrospective and prospective cross-sectional study and\nthe remaining 21 studies were prospective cross-sectional\nstudies. The study Chrispal et al., 2010* was a sub-analysis\nof the larger study [ 16]. 21 studies were conducted in TN.\nSixteen studies were conducted in KA. Two studies and\none study were conducted in KE and TS respectively\n(Fig. 2,A d d i t i o n a lf i l e1: Tables S5, S6, S7, S8, S9).\nPatient populations\nCase-series and case reports Among four case-series\n(Table 1A), one study dealt with malaria in children\n[73], while two studies evaluated rickettsial infections in\nchildren [ 74, 75] and one study evaluated scrub typhus\nin adults [ 76].\nAmong nine case reports (Table 1B), one evaluated\nscrub typhus [ 83] and another a coinfection of dengue\nand typhoid in a child [ 80]. Two studies evaluated mixed\ninfections in adults [ 77, 85]. Of the remaining four stud-\nies, all of which were conducted in adult patients, one\nBhaskaran et al. BMC Infectious Diseases          (2019) 19:970 Page 3 of 14\nevaluated scrub typhus [ 79], one evaluated hantavirus in-\nfection [ 78], and the remaining two evaluated Plasmo-\ndium vivax malaria and dengue respectively [ 82, 84].\nCross-sectional and case-control studies Three cross-\nsectional studies documented aetiology of AFI [ 2, 16, 55]\nand these were conducted in adults. Five studies con-\nducted on dengue, were conducted in children [ 48, 56, 58,\n62, 64]. One case-control study [ 72] was conducted in\nadults on the clinical and lab profile of dengue and scrub\ntyphus coinfection. Two cross-sectional studies [ 54, 60]\nwere conducted on malaria in adults while one was con-\nducted on leptospirosis in adults [ 53]. Fifteen studies were\nconducted on scrub typhus. Four studies were conducted\nin children [ 50, 51, 57, 59]. The remaining studies were\nmainly conducted in adults (Additional file 1: Table S10)\n[49, 52, 61, 63, 65– 71]. Across all studies, the setting was\npredominantly in the private sector with 85% cross-\nsectional studies and 75% case reports conducted in pri-\nvate settings (Fig. 3a). 35% of studies in TN evaluated\nscrub typhus while 13 and 10% in KA evaluated malaria\nand dengue respectively (Fig. 3b).\nNumber of diagnostics used per patient in AFI evaluation\nin various studies\nOut of 40 studies, 25 (63%) studies [ 2, 16, 48, 50, 51, 53,\n55, 57, 65, 68, 70, 71, 73– 85] used a combination of\npathogen-specific and nonspecific tests to evaluate\nFig. 1 Adapted from PRISMA study flow diagram [source: Mohr et al.

The\nremaining studies evaluated specific types of AFI (e.g.\nscrub typhus, dengue).\nAmong these 25 studies, seven studies (28%) used >1 0\npathogen-specific tests to ascertain the aetiology of AFI\n[16, 50, 65, 70, 76– 78]. Four (16%) studies used < 5\nspecific tests [ 73, 74, 81, 84].

Further, two studies (8%)\ntested for hantavirus as a cause of AFI [ 16, 78].\nMalaria\n26 studies used malaria diagnostics [ 2, 16, 48, 50, 51,\n53– 55, 57, 60, 65, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76– 85] 14 studies\n(54%) used smear microscopy for parasite detection\n[2, 16, 48, 53, 54, 57, 73, 74, 76, 77, 79, 80, 84, 85].\nand the remaining used RDT or quantitative buffy\ncoat (QBC) alone or in combination for malaria diag-\nnosis (Fig. 4a).\nDengue\nTwenty five studies tested for dengue and of those, nine\n(36%) did not specify type of testing done for diagnosis\nwhile 16 (64%) studies documented the use of specific\ntests like dengue immunoglobulin M and/or G enzyme\nlinked immunosorbent assay or immunochromato-\ngraphic test (IgM, IgG, ELISA, ICT) and Non-structural\nprotein 1 antigen (NS1) (ELISA or ICT) (Fig. 4b) [ 2, 16,\nFig. 2 Distribution of studies in South India [Source: created from mapchart.net (https://mapchart.net/)]\nBhaskaran et al.

BMC Infectious Diseases          (2019) 19:970 Page 8 of 14\nDiscussion\nThe pattern of testing for AFI indicates that malaria is\nthe most commonly suspected cause followed by den-\ngue, scrub typhus, typhoid and leptospirosis. This is in\nline with a multicentre aetiological study of AFI in India\nwhere in a cohort of 1564 patients, malaria was the com-\nmonest cause of AFI followed by dengue, scrub typhus,\nbacteraemia and leptospirosis in decreasing order of\nfrequency [ 35].\nBased on the current data from southern India, malaria\ndiagnosis by smear microscopy seemed more popular than\nantigen detection tests. As per the national guidelines for\nmalaria diagnosis and management [ 88, 89], microscopy\nremains the gold standard for confirming malaria, though\nRDT are also mentioned as a method for rapid detection\nof the parasite. In the diagnosis of dengue, only a sub-\ngroup of studies used a combination of NS1 and IgM\ndetection. The guidelines for dengue diagnosis and man-\nagement prepared by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) [ 90], and at the national level by the Indian\nCouncil of Medical research (ICMR) (2015) [ 91],\nrecommend the use of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nfor early detection of dengue. The IgM, IgG and NS 1 are\nother tests recommended in the diagnosis of dengue.\nThere is no recommendation on the benefits of combined\nuse of these diagnostics, however, there is strong evidence\ndemonstrating high diagnostic accuracy with the com-\nbined use of NS1 antigen and IgM detection in dengue\n[92]. The sensitivity and specificity of NS1 antigen test is\n49– 59% and 93 – 99% respectively while that of IgM anti-\nbody test is 71 – 80% and 46 – 90% respectively and the me-\ndian number of days of fever prior to admission sample\ncollection was 5 days (interquartile range, 3 to 7 days)\nfor both the above-mentioned tests [ 92]. The diagnostic\naccuracy for detection of IgM increases for late compared\nto early acute infection [ 93, 94]. The NS1 antigen is an\nearly marker of acute infection and its combined use with\nIgM detection can provide a definitive diagnosis of 96.9 –\n100% for samples obtained after 3 days of illness [ 95].\nThe ICMR guidelines (2015) [ 96], define a probable\ncase of scrub typhus or rickettsial infection as a sus-\npected clinical case showing a combination of a WFT\nFig. 6 Distribution of dengue cases detected by NS1, IgM and IgG tests in 3 studies of different sample sizes (n)\nFig. 5 Percentage distribution of studies using different test platforms for IgM, IgG and NS 1 detection\nBhaskaran et al. BMC Infectious Diseases          (2019) 19:970 Page 9 of 14\ntitres of 1:80 or above to OX2, OXK and OX19, and a\npositive IgM ELISA test. Further, the guideline defines a\nconfirmed case as being diagnosed either by PCR or\nIFA. In a review of scrub typhus diagnostics [ 97] pooled\nsensitivity/specificity of IgM detection by ELISA was\n66%/92%. In addition, the IgM ELISA provides a diagno-\nsis of scrub typhus as early as within 3 – 4 days of illness\n[98]. The WFT shows variable diagnostic accuracy as it\ndetects IgM antibodies due to cross-reactivity between\nthe antigens of Proteus and rickettsia and thus, the test\ncan be positive when there is no infection. To counteract\nthis problem, convalescent titres are often taken for an\naccurate diagnosis, however, this is challenging and\nmakes acute diagnosis impossible. The breakpoint titre,\nwhich is the antibody concentration required for a sig-\nnificant immunogenic response [ 87], varies and is\ndependent on the prevalence of the disease. In one Thai\nstudy, the overall sensitivities and specificities of WFT at\ncut-off titres of 1:1280, 1:640, 1:160, 1:80 were 5.1%/100,\n17.9%/100% and 52.1/93.3 and 79.5%/74.7% respectively\n[99]. The sensitivity and specificity of WFT differs with\nprevalence of disease which necessitates sero-surveys of\nantibodies to rickettsia in the population to inform diag-\nnostic interpretation [ 98, 100, 101]. Compounding the\ndiagnostic challenges, the WFT is generally positive in\nthe second week of illness [ 101] and is, therefore, sub-\noptimal for detection of early acute infection. Given all\nthese limitations, it is concerning that 39% of studies\nused WFT in diagnosing acute scrub typhus.\nTyphoid is a major cause of fever in Asia [ 102]. This\nwork shows that published studies from southern India\nused mainly Widal test for diagnosis. Unfortunately,\nWidal is an unreliable diagnostic test due to its inherent\nvariability, difficulty in establishing baseline titres for the\npopulation, cross-reactivity with other antigens and lack\nof reproducibility [ 103]. The sensitivity/specificity of\nWidal in a study conducted in Delhi was 57/83% [ 104]\nwhile another done in paediatric patients in Mysore was\n34.1%/42.8% [ 105]. The Typhidot test has an average\nsensitivity of 84% and specificity of 79% as stated in a re-\ncent Cochrane review on typhoid RDT [ 106].\nAcross most studies, the use of WFT and Widal dem-\nonstrates the use of suboptimal pathogen-specific tests\nin the diagnosis of AFI. Similarly, smear microscopy for\nmalaria lacks sensitivity at lower parasite densities [ 107].\nBeing labour-intensive, it may not be the ideal diagnostic\ntool in rural areas. Coinfections pose a challenge to phy-\nsicians and can lead to falsely localising signs, e.g. jaun-\ndice which mimics infective hepatitis. This necessitates\ntesting for additional pathogens as noted in two studies\nin this review [ 77, 85].\nAlthough this review provides a unique view of the\ndiagnostic workup for AFI in the Indian setting, it has\nsignificant limitations. As only one author has assessed\nthe studies, a bias in study assessment could have been\nintroduced. Similarly, peer-reviewed English language\nresearch articles were assessed, leading to a publication\nand language bias in this study. As all studies were con-\nducted in tertiary settings, it is possible that patients\nwith complications of AFI were evaluated due to a\nFig. 7 Percentage of scrub typhus cases diagnosed at different thresholds of antibody detection on WFT in 3 studies [ 50, 63, 71]\nTable 2 Breakpoint titre threshold for positive WFT\nStudy Positive\nthreshold\nThreshold for convalescent\nsera\nKumar et al., 2012 [ 50] ≥ 1:80 –\nMathai et al., 2003 [ 52] ≥ 1:80 –\nRazak et al., 2010 [ 63] ≥ 1:160 4-fold rise starting from 1:40\nStephen et al., 2015 [ 65] ≥ 1:320 4-fold rise starting from 1:40\nSubbalaxmi et al., 2014 [ 66] ≥ 1:80 –\nViswanathan et al., 2013 [ 70] ≥ 1:20 –\nVivekanandan et al., 2010 [ 71] ≥ 1:80 –\nKatoch et al., 2016 [ 74] ≥ 1:320 4-fold increase in paired sera\nManickam et al., 2014 [ 83] ≥ 1:160 –\nPrasannan et al., 2017 [ 75] ≥ 1:320 –\nBhaskaran et al.

This may have\ncontributed to numerous diagnostics being used due to\nthe added difficulty of diagnosing AFI with complica-\ntions. As the review assessed studies from South India,\nthis study cannot be extrapolated to other parts of India.\nThis is due to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of\nthe epidemiology of AFI and the diversity of health care\npractices in the Indian healthcare system. In addition,\nall the studies were conducted in teaching hospitals/\nresearch settings which strive to follow best practice\nwhich may not be reflective of practices in other\nhealth care settings.\nConclusions\nDespite its limitations, the review provides a novel and\ncomprehensive insight into the diagnostic evaluation of\nfebrile illness in South India. The data show that a\nmultitude of tests are being used, and it raises concerns\nregarding the potential patient management implications\nresulting from the use of suboptimal diagnostic tools.\nSimilarly, the timely diagnosis of AFI is crucial in prevent-\ning mortality and morbidity. Thus, health care providers\nneed guidance about the appropriate use of various tests\nand their utility at different stages of disease (e.g. IgM ver-\nsus NS1 for diagnosing dengue). National or sub-national\nguidelines provided by health authorities can additionally\nsupport a more unified approach to fever diagnostics. It\nalso highlights the need for further work to develop defini-\ntions for AFI and chronic fevers which might outline bet-\nter algorithmic management with appropriate use of\ndiagnostics in evaluating febrile illnesses. As a result of\nthese improved testing algorithms patients will be treated\nwith appropriate antibiotics in a timelier manner and un-\nnecessary antibiotic use can be curbed.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10.\n1186/s12879-019-4589-8.\nAdditional file 1.
