    "abstract": "Smart transformer is a power electronics-based transformer, offering voltage regulation and DC connectivity. As a transformer, its basic function is still power delivery. Smart transformer with advanced controls can support MV gird voltage by absorbing/injecting reactive power while actively regulate the LV grid voltage. Due to the controllable voltage in both MV and LV side, the power delivery of smart transformer is flexible. This paper focuses on the power delivery characteristic of smart transformer and compares with the conventional low frequency transformer with the help of STACTOM at its primary side or on load tap changer at its secondary side, in the power system by means of maximum deliverable power and power-voltage curve analysis. The Simulink results validate that the smart transformer improves system voltage stability compared to the traditional low frequency transformer with load tap changer.",
