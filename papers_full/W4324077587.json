  "abstract": "Weeding is very critical for agriculture due to its importance for reducing crop yield loss. Accurate recognition of weed species is one of the major challenges for achieving automatic and precise weeding. To improve the recognition performance of weeds and crops with similar visual characteristics, a fine-grained weed recognition method based on Swin Transformer and two-stage transfer learning is proposed in this study. First, the Swin Transformer network is introduced to learn the discriminative features that can distinguish subtle differences between visually similar weeds and crops. Second, a contrastive loss is applied to further enlarge the feature differences between different categories of weeds and crops. Finally, a two-stage transfer learning strategy is proposed to address the problem of insufficient training data and improve the accuracy of weed recognition. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we constructed a private weed dataset (MWFI) with maize seedling and seven species of associated weeds that are collected in the farmland environment. The experimental results on this dataset show that the proposed method achieved the recognition accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 99.18%, 99.33%, 99.11%, and 99.22%, respectively, which are superior to the performance of the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architectures including VGG-16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, SE-ResNet-50, and EfficientNetV2. Additionally, evaluation results on the public DeepWeeds dataset further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This study can provide a reference for the design of automatic weed recognition systems.",
