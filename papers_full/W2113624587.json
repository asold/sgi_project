However, analyzing\nthe large amount of data generated by high-throughput\ntechniques and translating these data into biological\nknowledge is currently a critical bottleneck in systems\nbiology. To study a disease at the system level, DNA\nmicroarrays are routinely used to provide a comparison\nof gene expression patterns in control vs. disease condi-\ntions. Because this comparison usually reveals a large\nnumber of differentially expressed genes, it is difficult, if\nnot impossible, to analyze the effect of each gene indi-\nvidually. In addition, high-throughput data often contain\nconsiderable noise, making individual or isolated gene\nobservations less likely to be relevant. Using statistical\nmethods to summarize the data can help reduce noise\nand increase the reproducibility of the results [1].\nHowever, translating these results into biological know-\nledge remains challenging.\nThe most commonly used methods for summarizing\ngene expression data rely on enrichment analysis of dif-\nferentially expressed genes to identify and rank Gene\nOntology (GO) terms and canonical pathways in order\nto characterize the underlying biological nature of the\ndata. Comprehensive reviews of these approaches are\navailable [2-4]. While the hierarchically ordered GO\nterms describe the properties of gene products, canon-\nical pathways describe the connectivity between genes\nand gene products involved in a given biological pro-\ncess.

A popular alternative to the hypergeometric test\nfor assessing the relevance of pathways is the gene set\nenrichment analysis (GSEA) [6]. This method considers\nthe relative positions of pre-defined gene sets (pathways)\nin a rank-ordered list of differentially expressed genes, in\norder to determine if a pathway is relevant to the experi-\nmental study.\nWell-studied canonical pathways provide extensive in-\nformation about how the genes and gene products inter-\nact and regulate each other. However, most of the\npathway analysis methods, including the hypergeometric\ntest and GSEA, treat pathways as lists of genes and do\nnot take into account the connectivity information em-\nbedded within the pathway. More recently, some studies\n[7-9] have included such topological information for\ncalculating enrichment of signaling pathways, by assign-\ning different weights to genes based on their location in\nthe pathway. Nevertheless, these methods still consider\neach pathway as an isolated entity, where, in reality,\npathways are not isolated; they may share genes. In fact,\nout of 130 non-metabolic pathways from the Kyoto\nEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database\n[10], 88 pathways have 20% or fewer genes unique to\nthat pathway, while only 6 pathways have 80% or more\nunique genes. In fact, all pathways shared at least one\ngene with another pathway. Thus, to fully take into ac-\ncount the biological information collected and encoded\nin a database such as KEGG, all pathways should be\npooled together to allow for exploitation of inter-\npathway connectivity information. However, none of the\ncurrent methods for pathway analysis incorporates intra-\nand inter-pathway connectivity information for enrich-\nment analysis.\nIn this study, we have attempted to address these\nissues by developing an algorithm for examining path-\nway enrichment that uses differential gene expression\n(or other molecular profiling data) to analyze\nPathways\nbased on Network information (PathNet). To incorpor-\nate inter-pathway connectivity, we combined KEGG\npathways (from www.kegg.com) to create apooled path-\nway. For enrichment analysis, PathNet first identifies the\nassociation of each gene with a disease (referred to as\ndirect evidence) by comparing gene expression data in\ncontrol patients vs. patients with the disease. Then,\nPathNet identifies the association of each gene’s neigh-\nbors with the disease (referred to as indirect evidence)\nbased on the inter- and intra-pathway connectivity infor-\nmation present in the pooled pathway. Finally, PathNet\ncombines the direct and indirect evidences to obtain the\nsignificance of the combined evidence. Based on the\nstatistical significance of the combined evidence for all\ngenes, PathNet uses the hypergeometric test to uncover\nthe pathways associated with the disease.\nAs genes in pathways function in a coordinated fash-\nion, association studies between pathways in the context\nof gene expression data can unravel the underlying com-\nplexity of biological processes. Li et al. [11] proposed\nthat pathways are more likely to interact when the num-\nber of protein-protein interactions (PPI) between pro-\nteins from two pathways are greater than what would be\nexpected by chance. Based on this assumption, they cre-\nate a network of pathways and identify the activated\npathway modules in a given study by mapping the gene\nexpression data enriched pathways onto the network.\nRecently, Kelder et al. [12] identified indirect associa-\ntions between pathways by integrating pathway informa-\ntion, PPI networks, and gene expression data. Liuet al.\n[13] estimated crosstalk by mapping gene expression on\nPPIs between proteins from the Alzheimer ’s disease\n(AD) pathway and other pathways sharing genes with\nthe AD pathway. As PPI networks are usually noisy,\nidentifying indirect associations using PPI network\nmight produce false positive associations. In contrast\nwith other approaches, PathNet assesses the association\nin the context of gene expression data based on intra-\nand inter-pathway connectivity in the pooled pathway.\nThis association of specific pathways, beyond the mere\noverlap of genes annotated as belonging to more than\none pathway, can reveal otherwise hidden pathway de-\npendencies (and hence biological insights) that are not\ndirectly attainable from enrichment analysis alone.\nTo illustrate the utility of PathNet, we applied it to\ntwo AD microarray datasets and analyzed the results in\nthe context of existing knowledge. In addition, we show\nhow the statistical scores of the associations between\npathways through gene expression data facilitated the\nidentification of a biological association between the AD\npathway and ubiquitin-meditated proteolysis pathway.\nMethods\nPathway network from KEGG pathways\nPathways from the KEGG database [10] available in\nNovember 2010 were downloaded as KEGG Markup\nLanguage files. Each of the 130 non-metabolic pathways\npresent in the KEGG database were represented as\ndirected graphs, where the nodes and edges of a graph\nwere, respectively, characterized by unique gene IDs and\ninteractions in the pathway. KEGG interactions repre-\nsenting processes, such as phosphorylation, dephos-\nphorylation, activation, inhibition, and repression, were\naccounted for by directed edges, whereas bidirectional\nedges were used to represent binding/association events.\nThe complete mapping between edge directionality and\nKEGG protein interaction attributes is provided in\nDutta et al. Source Code for Biology and Medicine2012, 7:10 Page 2 of 12\nhttp://www.scfbm.org/content/7/1/10\nAdditional file 1. All 130 pathways were combined to\ncreate a pooled pathway, and the R package, named‘An\ninterface to the BOOST graph library,' from Bioconductor\n(http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/rel-ease/bioc/html/\nRBGL.html) was used to convert this information into the\nadjacency matrix (A). The adjacency matrix is a non-\nsymmetric square matrix, where the number of rows\n(and columns) represents the number of genes present in\nthe pooled pathway. The diagonal elements of matrix A\nwere set to zero to exclude self-interactions. The non-\ndiagonal element Aij represents the directed KEGG protein\ninteraction between nodesi and j:\nAij ¼ 1 if there is an interaction from nodei to nodej\n0o t h e r w i s e\n/C26\nð1Þ\nIn the case of a bidirectional interaction, two edges are\nintroduced, one from nodei to node j and another from\nnode j to node i. Although the bulk of the genes\nannotated in KEGG pathways are present on most\nmicroarray chips, about 10% of the genes are typically\nmissing. In order to only include information derived\nfrom experimental data, we re-constructed the adjacency\nmatrix for each chip-set by deleting rows and columns of\ngenes that were not examined experimentally. In order to\nbe consistent in the analysis presented below, we also\nredefined thepooled pathwayfor each chip-set to include\nonly genes for which experimental data exists. PathNet\nautomatically carries out this step from the input files.\nPathway enrichment analysis\nPathNet combines two types of evidence for pathway\nenrichment analysis, referred to as direct evidence and\nindirect evidence (Figure 1). Direct evidence accounts\nfor the differential expression of gene i between two\nexperimental conditions (control and disease), while\nindirect evidence considers the differential expression\nof the neighbors of gene i in the pooled pathway.T h e\nnominal p-values associated with the direct and indirect\nevidences of each gene were combined to obtain the\np-value of the combined evidence, which is subsequently\nused for the pathway enrichment analysis.\nFigure 1Schematic representation of PathNet analysis.The direct evidence pertaining to differential gene expression is detected via\nmicroarray analysis while the indirect evidence of a gene is calculated from the direct evidences of its neighbors in the pathway. The direct and\nindirect evidences are combined, and the combined evidence is used to identify pathway enrichments via a hypergeometric test. The combined\ninput of microarray data and pathway information yields a final pathway enrichment list that can be associated with the different test conditions\nin the samples.\nDutta et al. Source Code for Biology and Medicine2012, 7:10 Page 3 of 12\nhttp://www.scfbm.org/content/7/1/10\nWe used the t-test to calculate a nominal p-value for\nthe direct evidence (pi\nD) in order to gauge whether the\naverage expression of gene i was different between the\ntwo experimental conditions. The lower the p D-value,\nthe more likely it is that the observed difference in gene\nexpression is significant. Alternative methods, such as\nSAM [14] or ANOVA [15], can also be used to estimate\np\nD.\nTo ascertain the significance of the indirect evidence,\nwe need to test whether the expression of each neighbor\nof gene i is or is not different between the two experi-\nmental conditions. To characterize this difference, we\nfirst calculated the indirect evidence score (SI\ni), which\nincorporates the topological information of the path-\nways. This score captures a weighted level of differential\nexpression of the neighbors of genei, and is calculated\nusing the following equation:\nSI\ni ¼\nX\nj∈G;i≠j\nAij /C3/C0 log10 pD\nj\n/C16/C17/C16/C17\nð2Þ\nwhere G denotes the set of all genes present in the\npooled pathway ,A ij is defined as in Eq. (1), and p j\nD\ndenotes the nominal p-value of the direct evidence for\ngene j which is used to assign the weight of the contri-\nbution. The nominal p-value associated with the indirect\nevidence (p\ni\nI) was inferred by testing if the observed\nscore SIi was greater than the corresponding random\nvalues created by shuffling the pj\nD-values in the pooled\npathway. In each of the N shuffles, all pj\nD-values were\nscrambled by randomly re-assigning their indices. As the\nconnectivity in the pooled pathway remained fixed, for\neach gene i in the nth shuffle, we calculated the corre-\nsponding random score SIi\nR(n). Next, for each genei,w e\nformally re-constructed the probability density distribu-\ntion function for the random scores p\ni\nR. Practically, we\nestimated the pi\nI-values by counting the number of ran-\ndom scores larger than the actual scores, as follows:\npI\ni ≡\nZ1\nSIi\nPR\ni xðÞ dx≈ 1\nN\nXN\nn¼1\n1i fSIR\ni nðÞ > SIi\n0 otherwise\n/C26\nð3Þ\nIn our calculations, we used N = 2,000 shuffles. As the\nestimated p i\nI-values are integer multiples of 1/N, we\ncannot accurately estimate pi\nI-values if they are less than\n1/N. To address this issue, we assigned 1/N as the mini-\nmum p\ni\nI-value. The lower the pi\nI\n-value, the more likely it\nis that the observed weighted gene expression pattern\naround genei is not a random pattern.\nWe obtained the p-value of the combined evidence\n(pi\nC) for each genei by using Fisher’s method [16] to ag-\ngregate the nominal p-values associated with the direct\nand indirect evidences (p i\nD and p i\nI\n). Previous studies\n[17,18] have shown that this method is optimal for com-\nbining independent p-values, when compared to other\nmethods. In our case, the indirect evidence associated\nwith a gene is dependent only on the magnitude of the\ndifferential gene expression of its neighbors, and not on\nits own expression levels, which formally ensures inde-\npendence between the p-values. Additional file 2 shows\np\nD- versus pI-values for the datasets we used and there\nwas no obvious dependency of these values on each\nother. We also verified that the set of p D-a n dp I-\nvalues were linearly independent for all comparisons by\ncalculating a non-significant correlation coefficient in\neach test set. Accordingly, for genei, the two probabilities\nwere combined based on Fisher ’s method, using the\nfollowing equation:\np\nC\ni ¼\nZ1\n/C0 2ln pD\ni /C3 pI\niðÞ\nP χ2\n4\n/C0/C1\nð4Þ\nwhere P( χ4\n2) denotes the probability density function\nof the χ2 distribution with 4 degrees of freedom. Note\nthat, even if the p D-a n dp I-values were correlated,\nthey could still be combined using a modified version\nof Fisher’sm e t h o d[ 1 9 ] .\nFor genes that are isolated and not connected in\nany pathway, there are no pI-values to consider, hence\npC =p D. Finally, we selected genes with p i\nC <0 . 0 5a s\ndifferentially expressed and used the hypergeometric test\nto calculate pathway enrichment. For all hypergeometric\ntests, we used the‘phyper’ function of the R programming\nlanguage.\nContextual association between pathways\nAs discussed above, KEGG pathways are not isolated;\nsome genes are shared between pathways. Thus, differ-\nential gene expression in one pathway may be directly\nlinked to differential gene expression in another path-\nway. Whereas the existing pathway annotations provide\na static association among genes and pathways, gene\nexpression data for particular conditions provide\ncontext-dependent information. Here, we considered all\nconnections in the pooled pathway to identify possible\ncontextual pathway-pathway associations based on a\nweighted measure of differential gene expression among\nshared pathway genes. Figure 2 outlines three ways in\nwhich differential gene expression data can link two\npathways that either directly share genes or are linked\nvia gene connections annotated in other pathways.\nWe calculated the contextual score SC\nαβ to quantify\nthe biological association via differentially expressed\ngenes from the pooled pathway, between two pathways\nDutta et al. Source Code for Biology and Medicine2012, 7:10 Page 4 of 12\nhttp://www.scfbm.org/content/7/1/10\nα and β. The SCαβ from pathway α to pathway β is cal-\nculated using the following equation:\nSCαβ ¼\nX\ni∈gα\nX\nj∈gβ\nAij /C3/C0 log10 pD\ni\n/C0/C1/C0/C1\n/C3/C0 log10 pD\nj\n/C16/C17/C16/C17\nð5Þ\nwhere gα and gβ denote the set of genes in pathwayα\nand β, respectively, Aij is defined as in Eq. (1), and pi/j\nD\ndenotes the nominal p-value of the direct evidence for\ngene i/j used to construct the weight for each Aij value.\nNote that as Aii ≡ 0, the SCαβ does not contain self inter-\nactions and only includes gene pairs that have been con-\nnected to each other via the pooled pathway .T h e\nformulation uses only the pD-values associated with the\ndirect evidence and not the p C-values, which already\ncontain pathway information via the indirect evidence as\ncalculated in Eq. (2). A higher SCαβ indicates a stronger\ncontextual association between the pathways.\nTo evaluate the probability of finding a SCαβ greater\nthan expected by chance alone, we followed the same\nprocedure used to estimate the p-values for the indirect\nevidence. The p-value associated with the SCαβ (pαβ)w a s\ninferred by testing if the observed score SC αβ were\ngreater than the corresponding random values created\nby shuffling all the pD-values in the pooled pathway N\ntimes. With the connectivity in the pooled pathway\nfixed, for each pathway pairα and β in the nth shuffle,\nwe calculated the corresponding random score SCαβ\nR (n).\nWe then formally re-constructed, for each pathway pair\nα and β, the probability density distribution function for\nthe random scores Pαβ\nR . Finally, we estimated the pαβ-values\nby counting the number of random scores larger than the\nactual scores for each pathway pair:\npαβ≡\nZ1\nSCαβ\nPR\nαβ xðÞ dx≈ 1\nN\nXN\nn¼1\n1i fSCR\nαβ nðÞ > SCαβ\n0o t h e r w i s e\n/C26\nð6Þ\nWe used N = 2,000 shuffles to estimate the pαβ-values.\nThe lower the pαβ-value, the more likely it is that the\nobserved weighted gene expression pattern connecting\npathways α and β are not a random pattern.\nWe also tested the extent to which the genes from\npathways α and β overlap, based on common genes be-\ntween the pathways. This information is only based on\nthe KEGG database and is not dependent on gene ex-\npression data, i.e. , we used the full complement of\nKEGG genes to estimate this overlap. The hypergeo-\nmetric test was used to estimate if the observed overlap\nwas statistically significant.\nFigure 2Schematic representation of three scenarios of\ncontextual association between pathways.Each illustration (A-C)\nshows two pathways (sets of both connected and isolated genes\ninside ellipsoids) with varying degrees of overlapping genes. The\nsize of the circles (genes) represents the level of differential gene\nexpression between control and disease patients (the higher the\nsignificance associated with the expression change, the larger the\ncircle). The lines and arrows represent KEGG-derived interactions\nbetween genes as annotated in thepooled pathway, and the thick\nlines represent edges connecting genes from Pathway 1 to Pathway\n2. (A) Overlapping pathways with high contextual association.\nWhereas Pathway 1 and Pathway 2 can be associated because\ngenes A and B are shared between the two pathways, the fact that\noverlapping genes are directly connected to other differentially\nexpressed genes (thick connections to large circles) enhances this\nassociation. (B) Overlapping pathways with low contextual\nassociation. The pathway maps are exactly the same as in case (A).\nHowever, Pathway 1 is“less” associated with Pathway 2 in the\ncontext of gene expression data, as the genes connected by thick\nedges are modestly differentially expressed (thick connections to\nsmall circles). (C) Non-overlapping pathways with high contextual\nassociation. Although, Pathway 1 and Pathway 2 do not share any\ngenes, genes from these two pathways are connected based on\ninter-pathway connectivity inferred from thepooled pathway.\nPathway 1 is contextually associated with Pathway 2 because the\ngenes connecting these two pathways are differentially expressed.\nDutta et al.

Both datasets were downloaded from the\nNational Center for Biotechnology Information’sG e n eE x -\npression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.\nnih.gov/geo/) and involved AD-related studies. The first\ndataset (GEO ID: GDS810) [20], which we refer to as the\ndisease progression dataset, investigated the expression\nprofile of genes from the hippocampal region of the brain\nas a function of the progression of the disease (incipient,\nmoderate, and severe). We refer to the second dataset [21]\nas the brain regions dataset. This dataset examined the\neffect of AD in six different brain regions: the entorhinal\ncortex, hippocampal field CA1, middle temporal gyrus,\nposterior cingulate cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and pri-\nmary visual cortex (GEO ID: GSE5281). Because different\nregions of the brain are involved in controlling different\nbiological processes, this dataset can provide insights into\nthe tissue-specific activation of pathways. The entorhinal\ncortex region samples were obtained from patients in the\nearly stages of AD, while the remaining samples were\nobtained from patients in the later stages of the disease.\nIn thedisease progression dataset, the expression of each\ngene in patients with incipient, moderate, and severe dis-\nease was compared with control patients using the t-test. In\nthe brain regions dataset, gene expression was compared\nbetween diseased and control patients for each brain region.\nWe applied the proposed pathway enrichment method for\neach of these nine comparisons (three from thedisease pro-\ngression datasetand six from thebrain regions dataset).\nResults and discussions\nComparison of PathNet with existing algorithms in\nidentifying pathways biologically relevant to AD\nWe used PathNet to identify the enrichment of pathways\nin each of the nine comparisons described above. We also\ncompared the results of PathNet with three existing algo-\nrithms for pathway analysis that are currently in wide use:\nthe hypergeometric test [5]; gene set enrichment analysis\n(GSEA) [6]; and signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA)\n[8]. The GSEA and SPIA packages were downloaded from\nthe Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/\nindex.jsp) and Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.\norg) Web sites, respectively. For GSEA, we used the pro-\nvided Java-version of the program with a pre-ranked gene\nlist. To ensure the comparability of results, we used the\nsame version of the KEGG pathways (downloaded in\nNovember 2010) for all comparisons. Finally, to account\nfor multiple comparisons, we corrected the pathway\nenrichment p-values for family-wise error rate (corrected\np-values are represented as pFWER) and used a significance\nthreshold of 0.05 for all comparisons. The results of all\nnine comparisons using each of the four pathway analysis\nmethods are provided in Additional file 3, Additional file 4,\nand Additional file 5. Here, we summarize the results and\nthe biological relevance of our findings.\nOur primary aim was to determine if these methods\ncould identify whether the AD pathway (KEGG ID:\n5010) is significantly enriched in AD patients vs. control\npatients. Figure 3 shows the degree of enrichment of the\nAD pathway for each of the comparisons, as measured\nby p FWER. Figure 3A shows that using the disease\nprogression dataset, none of the methods could identify\nsignificant enrichment in the AD pathway during the\nearly (incipient) stages of the disease. As the disease pro-\ngresses, the significance of the enrichment increased in\nall four methods. During the late (severe) stages of the\ndisease, three of the four methods could identify signifi-\ncant enrichment in the AD pathway. Notably, at moder-\nate stages of the disease, only PathNet was able to\ndetermine that the AD pathway was significantly\nenriched in AD patients.\nFigure 3Enrichment results for the AD pathway.Enrichment\nresults (pFWER: family-wise error rate corrected p-values) for the AD\npathway using four different methods in the (A) disease progression\ndataset and (B) brain regions dataset(VCX: primary visual cortex, EC:\nentorhinal cortex, HIP: hippocampal field CA1, MTG: middle temporal\ngyrus, PC: posterior cingulate cortex, and SFG: superior frontal gyrus).\nOnly PathNet could identify the AD pathway as significant in the\nmoderate stage of the disease (A), and the VCX region (B).\nDutta et al. Source Code for Biology and Medicine2012, 7:10 Page 6 of 12\nhttp://www.scfbm.org/content/7/1/10\nIn the brain regions dataset, all of the methods could\nidentify significant enrichment of the AD pathway in the\nmiddle temporal gyrus region and posterior cingulate\ncortex regions, however, none identified AD enrichment\nin the entorhinal cortex or superior frontal gyrus regions\n(Figure 3B). One plausible reason is that the entorhinal\ncortex samples were from patients with incipient disease.\nInterestingly, only PathNet could identify significant en-\nrichment of the AD pathway in the primary visual cor-\ntex. There is strong evidence in the literature that the\nprimary visual cortex region is indeed affected by AD\n[22,23]; hence, this is likely not a false positive finding.\nIn each of the comparisons, PathNet consistently yielded\nthe lowest p-value (p\nFWER) for the AD pathway.\nTo test the sensitivity of PathNet with respect to the\nother three pathway analysis methods, we compared the\nenrichment levels of seven pathways that have been fre-\nquently associated with AD in the literature. Table 1\nshows the results from the three stages of the disease\nusing thedisease progression dataset, with samples taken\nfrom the hippocampus region of the brain, and the\nresults in the brain regions dataset, with samples from\nthe hippocampal field CA1. PathNet correctly identified\nmost of these pathways as significantly enriched while\nthe other three methods failed to do so. The complete\nset of results is provided in Additional file 3, which cor-\nroborates the favorable performance of PathNet.\nTo test the specificity of PathNet, we investigated the\nbiological relevance of pathways co-enriched with the\nAD pathway. Table 2shows that in six out of the nine\ncomparisons where the AD pathway was enriched, we\nanalyzed pathways co-enriched with the AD pathway.\nEight pathways were co-enriched with the AD pathway\nin five or more of the six cases. Of these eight pathways,\nsix were related either to AD (regulation of actin cyto-\nskeleton; adherens junction; focal adhesion; and long-\nterm potentiation) or to other neurological diseases\n(Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease). Both the\nParkinson’s disease pathway and the Huntington ’s\ndisease pathway show significant overlap with the AD\npathway, which explains why they were frequently co-\nenriched. There is evidence in the literature to support\nthe association of each of these co-enriched pathways\nwith AD. This qualitatively implies that most of the sig-\nnificantly enriched pathways identified by PathNet are\nunlikely to be biological false positives.\nThe samples from thedisease progression dataset were\ncollected from the hippocampal field CA1 region. Simi-\nlarly, the brain regions dataset provides results of sam-\nples for patients with severe disease with samples also\ncollected from the hippocampal field CA1 region. There-\nfore, the data from these two samples, collected in the\nhippocampus for severe AD patients, should be compar-\nable and the overlap of their significantly enriched path-\nways can be considered as a measure of the quality of\nthe pathway analysis methods. Figure 4 shows the num-\nber of significantly enriched pathways from each dataset\nand their overlaps. We used the hypergeometric test to\ncompute the significance of the overlap, where the\nresults suggest that PathNet yielded the highest level of\nsignificance in overlap when compared to the other\nmethods.\nIn summary, we compared the results obtained when\nusing PathNet for pathway analysis vs. the results\nobtained with three existing widely used methods. We\nfound that PathNet was able to:1) identify the AD path-\nway as significant in cases where the existing methods\nfailed; 2) detect significantly enriched pathways that are\nknown to be biologically relevant to AD; and3) detect a\nhigher level of significance in overlap of the enriched\npathways in two independent datasets that are expected\nto be comparable.\nTable 1 Enrichment of pathways associated with AD\nPathway (KEGG ID) PathNet SPIA GSEA Hypergeometric test\nInc Mod Sev HIP Inc Mod Sev HIP Inc Mod Sev HIP Inc Mod Sev HIP\nAD pathway (5010) 1.00 *0.01 *0.00 *0.00 1.00 0.14 *0.00 *0.01 1.00 0.81 0.72 0.34 1.00 0.06 *0.00 *0.00\nFocal adhesion (4510) 1.00 *0.00 *0.00 *0.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 0.28 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00\nLong-term pote...

The complete set of\ndata is included in Additional files3, Additional files4, and Additional files5. The statistically significant pFWER-values (pFWER < 0.05) for each pathway and method\nare indicated by an asterisk (*). PathNet was able to identify these pathways as significant more often than each of the other three methods. SPIA was not\napplicable (represented by missing enrichment scores) when certain topological characteristics of the pathway was not met.\nDutta et al. Source Code for Biology and Medicine2012, 7:10 Page 7 of 12\nhttp://www.scfbm.org/content/7/1/10\nEstimation of false positive rates\nWe verified that PathNet ’s identification of pathways\nwas driven by the differential gene expression data - and\nnot only from the inherent connectivity of the pathways\nthemselves - by testing the performance of PathNet on\nrandomized input data. In the severe stage of thedisease\nprogression data, we randomly shuffled the gene names\n1,000 times and estimated the p FWER values for 130\npathways from PathNet. The randomization of gene\nnames ensures that the direct evidences and number of\ndifferentially expressed genes in the shuffled data is the\nsame as in the original data. The distribution of pFWER\nvalues given in Additional file 6 show that false positive\nrates from PathNet were low because 95% of the pFWER\nvalues were equal to 1. The false positive rate of PathNet\nat a pFWER cutoff of 0.05 (used in our analysis) was 0.02.\nWe further investigated if the difference in pathway top-\nology contributes to variations of false positive rates\namong pathways. We calculated false positive rates for\neach pathway from 1,000 random shuffles and plotted\nthe distribution of false positive rates for 130 pathways\n(Additional file 7). The maximum false positive rate was\n0.07, implying that none of the pathways have a signifi-\ncantly high probability of being identified as a false posi-\ntive. Hence, we cannot consider PathNet’s results to be\nan artifact of the pathway definitions themselves.\nContextual association between pathways\nIn this study, we introduced the concept of a contextual\nassociation between pathways, i.e., pathway connections\nthat are influenced by differential gene expression of\nneighboring genes rather than just the static overlap of\ngenes in pathways (Figure 2). Unlike the case of static\noverlap, these associations are specific to, and dependent\non, the biological conditions of the particular study.\nThese calculations identify pathway pairs where the dif-\nferentially expressed genes linked to each other in the\ntwo pathways are present at a greater frequency than\nwould be expected by chance alone.\nWe used PathNet to identify pathway associations in\neach of the two AD datasets described above. Because\nwe are interested in analyzing datasets related to AD, we\nspecifically analyzed pathways that have statistically sig-\nnificant contextual association with the AD pathway.\nWe focused on six comparisons (moderate and severe\nsamples in the disease progression dataset; and primary\nvisual cortex, hippocampal field CA1, middle temporal\ngyrus, and posterior cingulate cortex regions in thebrain\nregions dataset), where PathNet identified the AD path-\nway as statistically enriched. The results from all com-\nparisons are provided in Additional file 8. Among the\nAD contextually associated pathways, Table 3 lists the\nmost frequently appearing pathways in these six compar-\nisons (selected as occurring at least three times). We\nFigure 4Overlap of pathways.Number of enriched pathways that\noverlap between two comparable datasets (hippocampal field CA1\nregion for patients with severe AD), using four different methods\n(i.e., PathNet: the present study, SPIA: signaling pathway impact\nanalysis, GSEA: gene set enrichment analysis, and the\nhypergeometric test). As an example, PathNet identified 22 and 17\nstatistically significant pathways from thebrain regions datasetand\nthe disease progression dataset, respectively. Ten of these pathways\noverlapped. The statistical significances of the overlaps from each of\nthe four methods were tested using the hypergeometric test; p-\nvalues were as follows: pPathNet = 2.0 × 10-5,p SPIA = 1.5 × 10-4,\npGSEA = 1.0, phypergeometric = 3.3 × 10-4.\nTable 2 Pathways co-enriched with the AD pathway\nFrequency Pathway name (KEGG ID) References\n6 *Bacterial invasion ...

GnRH regulates the\nrelease of luteinizing hormone, which is elevated in AD\npatients. The luteinizing hormone is known to be involved\nin the formation of beta amyloid (Aβ), which is a patho-\nlogical hallmark of AD [46,47], and the neurotrophin\nsignaling pathway regulates the signaling of neurons [48].\nIn AD and other neurodegenerative conditions, neurotro-\nphin receptors (NTRs), such as p7NTR, bind to Aβ and\nnerve growth factors to promote cell death [49]. However,\nonly two of these six pathways (long-term potentiation\nand Huntington’s disease) were identified as co-enriched\n(in at least three out of six cases) in the pathway enrich-\nment analysis (Table 2).\nIf two pathways have significant overlap, i.e., they\nshare a large number of genes, there is an increased\nchance that they will be associated with each other.\nHowever, contextual association is dependent not only\non the extent of overlap, but also on the differential ex-\npression levels of genes that connect the two pathways.\nTo investigate if the contextual association provided in-\nformation beyond what could be expected by simply\nanalyzing the shared genes between the corresponding\npathway and the AD pathway, we calculated the p-value\nof the direct overlap of genes in each pathway with the\nAD pathway, using the hypergeometric test (Table 3). A\nlow p-value indicates that the pathway has a significantly\nhigh overlap with the AD pathway, and that the path-\nways are strongly associated with each other based on\nprevious knowledge encoded in the pathway definitions\nthemselves. Interestingly, in 31% of the cases we\nobserved that pathways with limited overlap had signifi-\ncant contextual association with each other. For ex-\nample, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is one of the\npathways that do not share any genes with the AD path-\nway, and yet we found that, in four out of six compari-\nsons, this pathway was contextually associated with the\nAD pathway (Table 3, Column 4). We therefore investi-\ngated the relationship between the AD and ubiquitin-\nmediated proteolysis pathways further. Figure 5 shows\nthat there are 112 edges connecting genes between these\ntwo pathways, which imply a possible association be-\ntween them. However, because these edges connect\ngenes from two non-overlapping pathways, we could not\nhave identified this relationship if we had treated the\npathways separately, or if we had used methods that re-\nlate pathways based solely on overlapping genes. It is\nwell established that deregulation of ubiquitin-mediated\nproteolysis can lead to the formation of neurofibrillary\ntangles (NFTs) from hyper-phosphorylated tau protein\n[31,56,57]. NFTs are one of the pathological hallmarks of\nAD, and the number of NFTs increases with the progres-\nsion of the disease [31]. However, this biologically rele-\nvant pathway is not statistically enriched from any of the\nfour pathway analysis methods used here (Table 1), sug-\ngesting that our contextual association between path-\nways can distil biological information that could not be\nobtained from enrichment analysis alone.\nIn summary, the following observations were made:\n1) enrichment analysis using PathNet performed better\nthan the three existing pathway analysis methods in\nidentifying biologically relevant pathways, 2) contextual\npathway-pathway analysis can reveal biological insights\nthat may not be obtained from enrichment analysis\nalone, and 3) the enrichment of pathways associated\nwith AD changes with disease progression.\nConclusion\nIn this study, we developed PathNet, a method for path-\nway analysis based on high-throughput molecular profil-\ning data, using inter- and intra-pathway connectivity\ninformation. PathNet calculates both pathway enrich-\nment and contextual associations between pathways. We\nhave shown that PathNet was able to identify the AD\npathway and other biologically relevant pathways in\nmultiple scenarios while three other widely used path-\nway analysis methods (hypergeometric test, GSEA, and\nSPIA) often failed to do so. PathNet also identified\nTable 3 Contextual association of pathways\nFrequency Pathway name (KEGG\nID)\nOverlap References\n(p-value)\n5 Gap junction (4540) 0.00 [ 50,51]\n5 GnRH signaling ...

In contrast,\nPathNet considers both inter-pathway and intra-pathway\nconnectivity for pathway enrichment. This connectivity\ninformation, in the form of a significance-level weighted\ngene-gene connection, corroborates and strengthens the\ndirect evidence of differential gene expression readily\nderived from microarray data when a gene’s neighbors\non the pathway are also differentially expressed. The\nmethod properly accounts for highly connected genes\nthat are part of multiple pathways via comparison with\nthe appropriate probability density function generated\nfrom topology-preserving randomized data. The un-\nbiased nature of this method was confirmed by the\nestimated low false positive rates. However, if no con-\nnectivity information is available for a gene, PathNet still\nincludes the microarray-derived evidence for identifying\npathway enrichment. This ensures that we do not\npenalize genes that have no information available regard-\ning their connectivity.\nIn PathNet, indirect evidence of a gene is calculated\nbased on gene expression levels of its neighbors using\nEqs. (1– 3). Hence, indirect evidence of the gene cannot\nbe estimated if neighboring gene expression is not mea-\nsured in the microarray analysis. In such cases, the com-\nbined evidence of a gene is replaced with the direct\nevidence. In the limiting case where none of the genes’\nneighbors expression levels are measured, PathNet con-\nverges to a standard hypergeometric test.\nCurrently, there is no gold standard for quantitatively\ntesting and comparing the performance of pathway en-\nrichment methods. As an alternative, we have selected a\nwell-studied disease (i.e., AD), where considerable\namount of knowledge already exists about the deregula-\ntion of its biological processes and multiple high-quality\nmicroarray datasets are available, to examine important\naspects of the disease. This allowed us to assess the per-\nformance of PathNet based on an in-depth analysis of\nthe biological relevance of the results, directly compare\nits performance with other existing pathway enrichment\nmethods, and ascertain each method’s ability to retrieve\nthe relevant biological information.\nAvailability and requirements\nSoftware name:PathNet\nDownload site:http://www.bhsai.org/downloads/pathnet/\nOperating system:Platform independent\nLicense: GPL version 3\nProgramming language:R version 2.14.1 or later\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1:KEGG directionality assignments.This file gives the\ntypes of edge directionality used in the KEGG pathway.\nAdditional file 2:Scatter-plots of direct and indirect evidences.A\nfigure showing the relationship between direct and indirect evidences for\nthe nine different comparisons used in this work.\nAdditional file 3:Hypergeometric test and PathNet results.An Excel\nspreadsheet of the results of all nine comparisons using the\nhypergeometric test and PathNet.\nAdditional file 4:GSEA results.An Excel spreadsheet of the results of\nall nine comparisons using GEAS.\nFigure 5Connection between Alzheimer’s disease and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.Differential gene expression levels from the\nposterior cingulate cortex region were overlaid on the Alzheimer’s disease (yellow) and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (blue) pathways.
