  "abstract": "As vital equipment in high-speed train power supply systems, the failure of onboard traction transformers affect the safe and stable operation of the trains. To diagnose faults in onboard traction transformers, this paper proposes a hybrid optimization method based on quickly and accurately using support vector machines (SVMs) as fault diagnosis systems for onboard traction transformers, which can accurately locate and analyze faults. Considering the limitations of traditional transformers for identifying faults, this study used kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to analyze the feature quantity of dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data, electrical test data, and oil quality test data. The improved seagull optimization algorithm (ISOA) was used to optimize the SVM, and a Henon chaotic map was introduced to initialize the population. Combined with differential evolution (DE) based on the adaptive formula, the foraging formula of the seagull optimization algorithm (SOA) was improved to increase the diversity of the algorithm and enhance its ability to find the optimal parameters of SVM, which made the simulation results more accurate. Finally, the KPCA–ADESOA–SVM model was constructed and applied to fault diagnosis for the traction transformer. The example analysis compared the diagnosis results of the proposed diagnosis model with those of the traditional diagnosis model, showing further optimization of the feature quantity and improvements in the diagnosis accuracy. This proves that the proposed diagnosis model has high generalization performance and can effectively increase the fault diagnosis accuracy and speed of traction transformers.",
