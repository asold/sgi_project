The results show that the linear correlation between the electrification degree \nand the electrostatic current was not good, and th e relation between the elect rification degree of oil \nflow and electrostatic current (i) could be expressed as  ρ\n(0) =0.2049 i (0) +169.4419 according to grey \nmodel GM (0, 2) when the electrification degree of oil flow is represented by the charge number \ngenerated from transformer oil per unit volume, namely the charge density (ρ). \n \nKeywords: Oil flow electrification, Electrostatic current, Grey model  \n \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nOil Flow Electrification was a kind of electrification \nphenomenon that occurs on the surface of solid insulation \nor in the insulating oil, which was caused by the friction \nbetween the oil and the surface of the insulation structure \ncomponents when the oil flows at a certain speed in the \ntransformer. It could also be explained by electrostatic \neffect. The Electrification Degree of oil flow, namely the \nCharging Tendency, or Electrostatic Charging Tendency \n(ECT), represents the capability of generating electric \ncharge when the transformer oil flows through the solid \ninsulation surface under certain external conditions such as \nvelocity of flow and pressure, and can be represented by \ncharge density ( ρ), which means the charge number \ngenerated from per unit volume of transformer oil: ρ= q/V \n(V is the total volume of transformer oil, and q is the total \ncharge number generated when oil flows through the solid \ninsulation surface). And we often use C/m\n3, pC/ml or \npC/cm3 as the unit of Electrification Degree [1-6].  \nThrough researches, scholars from all over the world \nhold the opinion that the electr ification of transformer oil \nflow has a lot to do with the insulation structure of the \ntransformer, oil flow velocity, oil temperature and charging \ntendency (electrification degree) of oil flow. At a certain \nflow velocity and under certain temperature, the \nelectrification of oil flow may cause partial discharge of \nUHV power transformers and oil aging, which may lead to \noperation accidents that mainly result from the damage of \ntransformers due to electrost atic discharge caused by the \nelectrification of oil flow. \nAt present, there are many researches covering the \nfields such as the major research methods and means of \nelectrification of transformer oil flow, the mechanism \nand influence factors of the electrification, the impact on \ntransformer oil caused by the electrification, and the \nmalfunction caused by the electrification as well as the \ncontrol measures. But there is hardly any research on the \nmathematical relation between the electrification degree \nof oil flow and the electrostatic current. Therefore, this \narticle adopts the linear regression method and grey \nmodel theory to study the mathematical relation between \nthe electrification degree of transformer oil flow and the \nelectrostatic current. \nElectrostatic current — i, is  the electrostatic streaming \ncurrent detected in oil or th e electrostatic leakage current \ndetected on solid insulation during the oil flow process. \nThe total charge number — q could be expressed by the \nequation q =\n0\nT\n∫ idt (T means the time required for the oil \nflowing through the solid insulation), so the equation  \nρ= ( 0\nT\n∫ idt)/V means that the el ectrification degree of oil \nflow could be calculated by detecting the electrostatic \ncurrent. Certainly, the definite relation between the \nelectrification degree of oil flow and electrostatic current \nmust be acquired before the calculation. That is to say, the \nmathematical expression of the relation between the \nelectrification degree of oil flow and the electrostatic \ncurrent must be researched [7-11]. \nThere are many mathematical methods that can be used \nto study the mathematical expression of incidence relation, \nincluding linear mathematical methods such as regression \nanalysis, variance analysis or other mathematical statistics \nmethods, and nonlinear mathematical methods such as grey \n†  Corresponding Author: School of  power and mechanical engi-\nneering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.

However, mathematical statistics methods \nsuch as regression analysis and variance analysis require \nlarge sample and good distribution pattern of the data, and \nthe data processing and calcu lation process is complicated. \nTherefore, their application is limited. Compared to that, \ngrey system theory needs less data ( ≥ 5 groups) and \ncalculation, which makes it possible to process finite and \nirregular data so as to find the internal characteristics of the \nsystem. As a result, grey model method is adopted to study \nthe mathematical expression of the relation between the \nelectrification degree of oil flow and the electrostatic \ncurrent, while linear regression method is adopted to \nconduct comparison.  \nIn order to study the mathematical expression of the \nrelation between the electrification degree of oil flow and \nthe electrostatic current, the electrification degree of oil \nflow and the electrostatic current of oil from two \ntransformers in a transformer substation were found in \nliterature [12-16]. \n \n \n2.

Research on the Relation between the \nElectrification Degree of Oil flow and the \nElectrostatic Current by Grey Model [17, 18] \n \n3.1 Brief introduction of grey model \n \n3.1.1 Grey System refers to a system with its information \npartly explicit. Grey System theory needs less data (≥ \n5 groups) and calculation,  which makes it possible \nto process finite and irregular data so as to find the \ninternal characteristics of the system. \n \nModel obtained from grey system is called GREY \nMODEL (GM). An nth-order GM with h variables should \nbe denoted by GM (n, h). It represents the influence of \nother (h-1) variables on the nth-order derivative of a \nvariable, in which n represents the nth-order derivative of a \nvariable, and could be 0, 1, 2, 3… But generally it would \nnot exceed 3, because a bigger n means richer connotation, \nand it would also be harder to solve the secular equation of \na high-order system. Not onl y the calculation process is \ncomplicated and time-consuming,  but also the accuracy is \nnot necessarily high, and the result is not analytical. And h \nrepresents h variables. \nWhen the other factors of transformer and its oil are \nfixed, GM (0, h) model could be used to study the relation \nbetween the electrification degr ee of transformer oil flow \nand the electrostatic current. \nGM (0, h) model refers to a 0-order model with h \nvariables. 0-order means no dynamical variables and the \nsystem is static. For the transformer and its oil system, \nwhen the other factors of th e transformer and its oil are \nfixed, GM (0, 2) model could be used to study the relation \nbetween the electrification degr ee of transformer oil flow \nand the electrostatic current. \n \n3.1.2 For the GM (0, h) model, there is a differential \nequation, as in (1). \n \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )111 1\n11 22 3 2 1 ... hhx bx bx b x a −−= ++ + +   (1) \n \nDefine: \n1\n(1) (1)21\n(1) (1)21\n(1) (1)2\n(2)  ...

The \nresidual error of data i is defined as (0) (0)() ()ix iε =−  \n(0)ˆ () ,x i  1, 2,...,in= .  \n() ()0x i is the ith initial data, and (0)ˆ ()x i  is the predicted \nvalue of the ith initial data.  \nThe content of posteriori differential test is to examine \nthe probability of occurrence of small residual error and the \nvalue of some related indicators of the residual error \naccording to the value of\n() ()0 iε . \nData needed for the posteriori differential test include: \nthe average value of the initial data — () ()0\n1\n1 N\ni\nx xiN =\n= ∑  \n(N means the number of the initial data), the variance of \nthe initial data — () ()()\n2\n022\n1\n1 n\ni\nSx i x n =\n=− ∑ , the average value \nof the residual error — () ()0\n1\n1 n\ni\ninεε\n=\n= ∑ , the variance of the \nresidual error — () ()()\n2\n021\n1\n1 n\ni\nSi n ε ε\n=\n=− ∑ (n means the \nnumber of the residual error and usually n ≤ N), the ratio of \nthe posteriori differential —\n1\n2\nSC S= , and the probability of \nsmall residual error — () ()(({ }0\n20.6745PP i S εε=− ≺ . \nA model with good extrapolation must have a small C, \nbecause a small C means a small S 2and a big S1. S1 is the \nvariance of the initial data, and the bigger it is, the more \ndiscrete the initial data will be, namely the regularity of the \ninitial data will be poor. S\n2 is the variance of the residual \nerror, and a small S 2 means the residual error will be less \ndiscrete. Thus, a good model needs a big S 1 and a small S2. \nAs an aggregative indicator, the smaller C is the better. A \nsmall C means the residual error is less discrete, although \nthe initial data is irregular. Ordinarily C < 0.35 or < 0.65 is \nrequired. \nAnother indicator of good extrapolation is a big p. If \nresidual error\n() ( )0 iε ε− <0.6745S2 or relative residual \nerror () ( )0\n2/iSεε − <0.6745, it could be called small error. \nIt would be more reasonable to use relative residual error \ninstead of residual error, because a bigger S 2 allows a \nbigger () ( )0 iε ε− . Generally p should be less than 0.95 \nand not below 0.7. \nAccording to the value of p and C, the model could be \ndivided into 4 precision levels just as showed in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1.

First of all, the general form \nof GM (0, h) is established, and the electrification degree \nof oil flow—\nρ and electrostatic current-i are substituted. \nThen the concrete form of GM (0, h) is obtained by \ncalculation. After that, the posteriori differential test is \nconducted, and the accumulated  value of the calculation \nresults is compared with that of the measured results to \ninspect the precision and extrapolation of the model. Then, \nGM (0, h) model is converted into linear regression model, \nand the concrete form of the linear regression model is \nobtained by calculation. Meanwhile, posteriori differential \ntest is conducted, and the ca lculated value is compared \nwith the measured value. According to the results above, \nthe final Grey Model of the relation between the \nelectrification degree of oil flow and the electrostatic \ncurrent is obtained. \n \n3.3 The GM (0, 2) model of  the relation between the \nelectrification degree of oil flow and the elec-\ntrostatic current \n \nThe data of oil sample 1 was used to establish the \nconcrete form of the GM (0, 2) model of the relation \nbetween the electrification degree of oil flow and the \nelectrostatic current.
