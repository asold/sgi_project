Nursebo, P. Chen,member, IEEE,and O. Carlson\nAbstract—As the capacity of wind power installed in a radial\ndistribution system (DS) increases, there is a concern that it\nmay introduce more frequent tap change operations in substation\ntransformers. The increase in the frequency of tap changes (FTC)\ncan accelerate the wear and tear of the tap changers. As a result,\nthe introduction of wind power to DSs may be hindered. Hence\nthe aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of wind power\nintegration on the FTC in a radial DS. A case study shows that the\nchanges on the FTC in DSs connected to relatively strong external\ngrid is negligible up to signiﬁcant level of penetration. But in\nDSs connected to a relatively weak external grid, a signiﬁcant\nincrease in the FTC has been observed as wind power penetration\nincreases. Hence a further investigation is carried out to limit\nthe FTC by using reactive power from local wind turbines. The\nresults have shown that the methodology is very effective.\nIndex Terms—wind power, tap changer, reactive power, load\nﬂow analysis, power transformers\nN OMENCLATURE\nbk,j series susceptance between busk and bus j\nbc\nk,j shunt susceptance between busk and bus j\ngk,j series conductance between busk and bus j\nI a set containing all buses in the network\ni ∈ I\nu ∈ I\nJ the set of all buses excluding the buses connected\nto the tap side of a transformer\nj ∈ J\nK the set of all buses excluding the buses connected\nto the non-tap side of the transformer\nk ∈ K\nnk,j,t tap ratio of the transformer between busk and\nbus j at timet\nnmax\nk,j the maximum tap ratio of the tap changer\nnmin\nk,j the minimum tap ratio of the tap changer\nP2,t active power consumed at node ‘2’\nQ 2,t reactive power consumed at node ‘2’\nPi,t active power produced at busi and timet\nPD\ni,t active power consumed at busi and timet\nPmax\ni,t maximum value of active power production at\nbus i and timet\nThis work was ﬁnanced by Chalmers energy initiative.\nS.

INTRODUCTION\nT\nRANSFORMERS are the most critical components of a\ndistribution system (DS). Since they are capital intensive,\nonly few transformers supply power to a large number of\ncustomers in a given DS. Hence high availability of these\ncomponents is given utmost importance by any given DSO.\n2\nThe failure of a transformer, besides jeopardizing the reli-\nability of the DS, will expose the DSO to a huge amount of\ncost. The causes of transformer failure are numerous [\n1]–[6].\nHowever the majority of transformer failures can be traced\nback to a faulty tap changer [\n4]–[7]. Hence, in terms of the\nreliability of the transformer, tap changers can be considered\nas the critical part of the transformer. This is evident fromthe\nextensive literature that is devoted for condition monitoring\nand maintenance of tap changers [6]–[13].\nThe main reasons for the failure of tap changers are the\nerosion of the diverters contact due to switching arcs, the\nwear and tear of the mechanical components such as the\nenergy accumulator springs, carbon formation in the diverter\noil caused by arcing, and breakdown of the insulating materials\ndue to accumulation of sludge. Among these the ﬁrst three\ndirectly relate to the number of tap operations that occurred\nin the tap changer. Especially the wear in the diverter contacts\ndepends not only on the number of tap changes but also on\nthe transformer load during the tap change [\n13].\nWith the increased introduction of wind power in DSs,\nsome DSOs are concerned about its possible effect on the\nwear and tear of the tap changers. This concern mainly\narises from a ﬂuctuating nature of wind power as well as the\npossible increase in the power ﬂow through the transformer.\nThe ﬂuctuating power output from the wind turbines can\nintroduce high power ﬂow ﬂuctuation through the transformer.\nThis may ultimately lead to an increase in frequency of tap\nchanges. If this is the case, considering the power system is\nalready vulnerable to wear and tear due to aging, the DSO\nmay limit the integration of wind power to its network for\nfear of increased maintenance costs or unexpected tap changer\nfailures. Hence, such concerns may hinder the integration of\nrenewable energy sources at a time governments are working\nto increase the share of these energy sources.\nHowever the investigation of the effect of wind power\nintegration on the frequency of tap changes (FTC) is given\nonly a minor attention. There are only a few papers, to the\nauthors’ knowledge, that have given some focus to FTC in\nthe presence of wind power [\n14]–[17].\nIn [14]–[16] the aim is on how to better regulate the voltage\nof a DS in the presence of wind power. Some focus is given\nto the effect of different voltage regulation approaches onthe\nFTC. However, these papers have not investigated the effect\nof wind power introduction on the FTC.\nThus, it is only [\n17] that have analyzed the effect of wind\npower variability on the FTC. The analysis is done for wind\nturbines installed in meshed sub-transmission system. From\nthe result of the analysis, it is concluded that, in general,wind\npower injection increases the FTC. The increase is found to\nbe signiﬁcant when the wind turbines are involved in voltage\nregulation.\nIn [\n17] the change in the FTC due to wind power is analyzed\nbased on only one month data. However we have observed in\nour analysis that wind power can increase the FTC in one\nmonth and decrease in the other. Hence an analysis based on\none month data cannot give the full picture of the effect of\nwind power on the FTC. In addition, as we can see later,\nthe effect of wind power on the FTC also depends on the\ngrid strength. However this has not been presented before.\nMoreover, the use of reactive power compensation to reduce\nthe FTC is not investigated either.\nThus this paper tries to ﬁll the gap in this area. A detailed\nanalysis of the effect of wind power integration on the FTC\nis carried out based on one year measured wind power and\nload data obtained from a DSO in Sweden. Moreover, most\nvariable speed wind turbines have the capability to providea\nconsiderable amount of controllable reactive power support.\nThus, a further investigation is carried out to use this readily\navailable reactive power from the wind turbines to decreasethe\nFTC, wherever there is the need to do so. Such investigation\nis valuable because, as mentioned above, tap changers are\nexposed to wear depending on the number of operation they\nhave undergone. Moreover reactive power can provide a better\nvoltage regulation at secondary side of the transformer since,\nunlike tap changer, it does not have a time delay in operation.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section\nII, the\nproblem is formulated mathematically. SectionIIIprovides the\nresults from the case study where the effect of wind power\non the FTC is discussed in detail. It also investigates the\npossibility of using reactive power from the wind turbines to\ndecrease the FTC. Finally Section\nIV provides the conclusion\nof the paper.\nII. PROBLEM FORMULATION\nThis section has two subsections. The ﬁrst subsection\npresents the mathematical model that can be used to determine\nthe number of tap changes in a given distribution. The model\nuses network, load and wind power data as an input. The next\nsubsection develops the model further to incorporate reactive\npower compensation (RPC) as a means to reduce the FTC.\nA. Model set up for analyzing the effect of wind power on\nfrequency of tap changes\nTo analyze the effect of wind power on the FTC one has\nto determine the FTC with and without wind power. Thus, a\nmathematical model is needed to determine the FTC in each\ncase. Such a model can be used to carry out a series of load\nﬂow calculations using the network, load and wind power data\nas inputs. The main aim of these load ﬂow calculations is\ndetermining the tap position at each time step satisfying the\ndifferent equality and inequality constraints.\nMain□grid k j\nF\n, ,\nF\n, ,\nt j k\nt j k\nQ\nP\n1 :, ,t j kn F\n, ,\nF\n, ,\nt k j\nt k j\nQ\nP\nFig. 1: A simple distribution network with wind power and load\nconnected.\nDuring a load ﬂow calculation at time stept, the difference\nbetween the tap ratiosnk,j,t and nk,j,t−1 needs to be as small as\npossible (see Fig.\n1). Let this difference be the tap step taken\nat time t i.e.W k,j,t. Thus the load ﬂow calculation at each time\n3\nstep,t, can be formulated as an optimization problem with the\nobjective function to minimize the number of tap changes at\neach time stept:\nmin\nW\nO t := ∑\nk\n∑\nj\nW 2\nk,j,t (1)\nSubject to equality and inequality constraints described as\nfollows.\n1) The inequality constraints:The inequality constraints\ninclude the limit on secondary side voltage of the transformer,\nV min\ni ≤ Vi,t ≤ V max\ni (2)\nthe limit on the available range of tap ratio,\nnmin\nk,j ≤ nk,j,t ≤ nmax\nk,j (3)\nand the limit on the available active and reactive power of\ngenerators at each node in the network\nPmin\ni,t ≤ Pi,t ≤ Pmax\ni,t\nQ min\ni,t ≤ Q i,t ≤ Q max\ni,t\n(4)\nIn the case study, it is only at the slack bus (inﬁnite grid)\nthat the active and reactive power is produced. HencePj,t and\nQ j,t is limited to zero at all buses except the slack bus. Wind\npower generation is included into the load ﬂow equations as\na negative load with unity power factor.\n2) Equality constraints:The equality constraints consist of\nthe load ﬂow equations,\nPi,t− PD\ni,t = ∑\nu\nYi,uVi,tVu,tcos(\nθi,u + δu,t− δi,t)\nQ i,t− Q D\ni,t = −∑\nu\nYi,uVi,tVu,tsin(\nθi,u + δu,t− δi,t) (5)\nand\nnk,j,t = nk,j,t−1 +W k,j,tΔV (6)\nIn the load ﬂow equations the tap ratio of the transformer\nmay change from one time step to another. This changes\ncertain elements of the bus admittance matrix from one time\nstep to another, which increases the number of variables in\nthe model. Clearly, this imposes extra computational burden\non the simulation. Hence the load ﬂow equations in (\n5) are\nmodiﬁed so that they do not use the bus admittance matrix\ndirectly. The discussion of these modiﬁed load ﬂow equations\nis provided as follows.\n3) Modiﬁed load ﬂow equations:The link between two\nbuses is usually either a power line or a transformer. The\npower line can be represented by an equivalent\nπ -model as\nshown in Fig.2.\nk j\nF\n,\nF\n,\nk j\nk j\nQ\nP\nF\n,\nF\n,\nj k\nj k\nQ\nP\nj ky ,\n2\n,\nc\nj kjb\n2\n,\nc\nj kjb\nFig. 2:π -model of a power line.\nA transformer between two buses is represented by the\nequivalentπ -model shown in Fig.3\nk j\nF\n,\nF\n,\nk j\nk j\nQ\nP\nF\n,\nF\n,\nj k\nj k\nQ\nP\nj kj kny ,,\nj k\nj k\nj k y\nn\nn\n,2\n,\n, )1 (/c45\nj k\nj k\nj k yn\nn\n,\n,\n, ) 1( /c45\nTap□side Non-tap□side\nFig. 3: Equivalent circuit of a tap changing transformer [18].\nHence, for the network which contains both of these ele-\nments, i.e. power lines and transformers, the link between any\ntwo buses can be represented by the model shown in Fig.4.\nk j\nF\n,\nF\n,\nk j\nk j\nQ\nP\nF\n,\nF\n,\nj k\nj k\nQ\nP\nj kj k ny ,,\n2\n,\nc\nj kjb\n2\n,\nc\nj kjbj k\nj k\nj k y\nn\nn\n,2\n,\n, )1 (/c45\nj k\nj k\nj k yn\nn\n,\n,\n, ) 1( /c45\nFig. 4: An equivalent model for a link between any two nodes.\nThe power ﬂow from busk to any other busj at timet is\ngiven by:\nPF\nk,j,t =\n( Vk,t\nnk,j,t\n) 2\ngk,j− Vk,tV j,t\nnk,j,t\nyk,jcos(δj,t− δk,t+ ϕk,j)\nQ F\nk,j,t = −V 2\nk,t\n(\nbk,j\nn2\nk,j,t\n+\nbc\nk,j\n2\n)\n+ Vk,tV j,t\nnk,j,t\nyk,jsin(δj,t− δk,t+ ϕk,j)\n(7)\nand power ﬂow from bus j to any other busk at timet is\ngiven by:\nPF\nj,k,t = V 2\nj,tgj,k − V j,tVk,t\nnk,j,t\nyj,k cos(δk,t− δj,t+ ϕk,j)\nQ F\nj,k,t = −V 2\nj,t\n(\nbj,k +\nbc\nj,k\n2\n)\n+ V j,tVk,t\nnk,j,t\nyj,k sin(δk,t− δj,t+ ϕk,j)\n(8)\nIn (7) and (8), if the link between two buses is a cable\nor overhead line, the tap ratio is one and the equations will\nrepresent the power ﬂow in the circuit shown in Fig.\n2. On the\nother hand, if the link between two buses is a transformer the\nshunt capacitance is equal to zero. Then (\n7) and (8) represent\nthe power ﬂow in the circuit shown in Fig.3.\nNow the load ﬂow equations in (5) are replaced by (9) and\n(10) below as equality constraints.\nFor bus ink ∈ K :\nPk,t− PD\nk,t = ∑\nj\nPF\nk,j,t\nQ k,t− Q D\nk,t = ∑\nj\nQ F\nk,j,t\n(9)\nFor busj∈ J:\nPj,t− PD\nj,t = ∑\nk\nPF\nj,k,t\nQ j,t− Q D\nj,t = ∑\nk\nQ F\nj,k,t\n(10)\nEquations (\n7) - (10) do not contain the variable bus admit-\ntance matrix. In other words, there is no need to recalculate\nadmittance matrix any more. This leads to a reduction in the\nnumber of decision variables in the optimization model.\n4\nB. Modeling the use of RPC to decrease the frequency of tap\nchanges\nIn this section we develop the model for analyzing the use\nof reactive power from the wind turbines to decrease the FTC.\n1) The objective function:When there is a continuously\ncontrollable reactive power from wind turbines, it can be used\nto decrease the FTC. In principle, reactive power is consumed\nto avoid a tap increase during low load condition and produced\nto avoid a tap decrease during high load condition. However\nreactive power is not consumed or produced when there is\nno potential tap change or the available reactive power is not\nsufﬁcient to prevent a tap change. In the latter case, it is better\nto use tap regulation directly as unnecessary reactive power\nﬂow increases system power losses. In order to model this,\nthe objective function is modiﬁed as follows:\nmin\nW ,Q\nO t := ∑\nk\n∑\nj\naW 2\nk,j,t+ ∑\ni\nQ 2\ni,t (11)\nThe term on the far right side is added to produce or\nconsume as minimum amount of reactive power as possible\nfrom the wind turbines. On the other handa is a constant\nof sufﬁciently large value added to prioritize using RPC,\nwhenever possible, instead of tap changing. In our analysis,\nselecting the value ofa to be above 1000 gives the required\nresult.\n2) The constraints:The equality constraints discussed in\n(\n6), (9), (10) and the inequality constraints discussed in (2),\n(3) hold true here as well.\nThe reactive power limits,Q min\ni,t and Q max\ni,t in (\n4), can be\ndeﬁned in terms of a given minimum operating power factor\nlimit,Φ min. These limits can also be constrained by the thermal\ncapability of the wind turbine,Smax\ni . This happens when the\nwind turbines are operating around the rated power output.\nHence for a given wind turbine at busi, the reactive power\nlimits are given by (\n12) and (13).\n− Q cap\ni,t ≤ Q i,t ≤ Q cap\ni,t (12)\nwhere\nQ cap\ni,t = min\n( √\n(Smax\ni )2 − P2\ni,t,Pi,t\n√\n(1 − (Φ min)2)\nΦ min\n)\n(13)\nIn caseΦ min is extended to zero, i.e. when the wind turbines\nare providing reactive power support even when they are not\nproducing active power, (\n12) and (13) can be reduced to (14).\n−\n√\n(Smax\ni )2 − P2\ni,t ≤ Q i,t ≤\n√\n(Smax\ni )2 − P2\ni,t (14)\nC. The ﬂow chart of the proposed sequential load ﬂow simu-\nlation\nThe model formulated in this paper is to be used in\nradial DS where there are usually one or two transformers\nin parallel. Under such condition the binary variable,W k,j,t,\ncan be replaced by a continuous variable,W ′\nk,j,t, and (\n15) can\nbe used to calculateW k,j,t. This results in a model which\ncan be solved more efﬁciently using solvers developed for\nnonlinear programs, e.g. [\n19]. However whenever this model\nis used in networks where there are a couple of tap changing\ntransformers at different locations there could be an optimality\nproblem. Hence under such situation the problem should\nbe solved as mixed integer nonlinear programming model\n(MINLP).\nW k,j,t =\n\n\n\n\n\nround(W ′\nk,j,t), if\n⏐\n⏐\n⏐W ′\nk,j,t\n⏐\n⏐\n⏐≤\nε\nceil(W ′\nk,j,t), if W ′\nk,j,t > ε\nﬂoor(W ′\nk,j,t), if W ′\nk,j,t < −ε\n(15)\nThe ﬂow chart of the overall simulation is presented in Fig.5.\nStop\nRun□optimization□for□time t, with\nobjective□function (1) or (11)\n?'\n, , /c101 /c163t j kW\n?tt max/c62\n; 1/c43/c61 tt\nY\nN\nY\nN\nVWnn t j kt j kt j k /c68/c43/c61 /c45 *, ,1 , ,, ,\n(15)inasDetermine k,j,tW\n1, ,, , /c45/c61 t j kt j k nn\nRun□optimization, with\nobjective□function (1) or (11)\n11 0 /c61/c61 k,j,,□nt Initialize\nFig. 5: The ﬂow chart of the proposed sequential load ﬂow simulation.\nIII. CASE STUDY\nA. Network and data description\nThe case study is based on a rural 11 kV network operated\nby Falbygdens Energi located in Falk¨oping area in Sweden.\nThe network is fed by a 40 kV grid through a 10 MV A\n45±8×1.67%/11.5 kV transformer with percentage impedance\nof 8%. The tap changer regulates the voltage at the secondary\nside of the transformer with the set point voltage of 10.7 kV\nand ±1.2% deadband. In this DS, there are 13 wind turbines\ninstalled, with an overall installed capacity of 12.225 MW.\nFrom these wind turbines there are hourly measured time\nseries data available for one year in 2011. Hourly measured\nactive and reactive power data at the substation are also\navailable for the same year. Active power consumption in the\nnetwork is then calculated by adding the measured wind power\ndata and active power measurement at the substation. Currently\nthe wind turbines operate at unity power factor (PF) setting,\nthus the reactive power is assumed to come from consumer\nloads only. Thus the wind power and load data so obtained\nhave been used in the load ﬂow analyses done in this paper.\nB. Effect of wind power on frequency of tap changes\nThe aim here is to ﬁnd out if wind power can contribute to\nan increase in the FTC. Thus no reactive power compensation\nfrom the wind turbines is considered.\n5\nWith the data described in the above subsection, the math-\nematical model developed in SectionII is implemented in\nGAMS. Two cases are investigated:\n• Case 1: only consumer load is assumed to be connected\nto the network without wind power in the system.\n• Case 2: both load and wind power are connected to the\nsystem. This is the existing system condition.\nFig.\n6 shows the number of tap changes at each hour of a\nday summed over one year. It can be seen from Fig.6 that\n0:00 3:00 6:00 9:00 12:00 15:00 18:00 21:00\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nTime\nNumber of tap changes\n \n \nCase 1: up−regulated\nCase 1: down regulated\nCase 2: up−regulated\nCase 2: down regulated\nFig. 6: Number of tap changes on each hour of a day summed over\na year.\nfor both cases, the diurnal variation of tap changes followsa\nsimilar trend: with a large number of tap changes at 6:00 and\n7:00 in the morning and at 23:00 and 0:00 during the night.\nThere are also considerable tap changes at 15:00 and 16:00.\nUsually the tap changes in the morning (speciﬁcally be-\ntween 5:00 and 10:00) are down regulations to boost the\nvoltage on the secondary side. During this period, the load\nincreases due to the startup of a factory, connected to this\nDS, and residential loads. During the rest of the day, the tap\nis usually up-regulated due to the dominance of lighter load\nconditions than in the morning.\nThe total number of tap changes for Case 1 is 585 and for\nCase 2 is 505. Thus, contrary to our expectation, the FTC has\ndecreased when there is wind power in the DS. The reason\nfor the decrease in number of tap changes is explained using\nFig.\n7 and Fig.8.\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\npower□(MW/MVAr)\ntimeload(active) wind□power net(active) Load(reactive)\nFig. 7: Load and wind power proﬁle at speciﬁc day of the year.\nFig.7 shows the load and wind power proﬁle for a speciﬁc\nday and Fig.8 shows the tap positions of the tap changer in\nthe same day. It can be seen in Fig.8, between the period 5:00\n00:00 03:00 06:00 09:00 12:00 15:00 18:00 21:00\n0\n1\n2\ntime\nTap positions\n \n \nCase 1\nCase 2\nFig. 8: Tap position of the tap changer at speciﬁc day of the year.\nand 16:00, there are three tap changes in Case 1 compared to a\nsingle tap change in Case 2 (see Fig.\n8). From Fig.7, one can\nmake two observations. On one hand, the variability of load\nfollows the variability of wind power. These results in a less\nvariable net active power. On the other hand, during part of this\nperiod (for example between 14:00 and 20:00) when the net\nactive power increases, the reactive power decreases and vice\nversa. This, according to (\n16)1 [20], results in lower voltage\nchange on the secondary side of the transformer compared to\nCase 1.\nΔU t ≈ RP2,t+ XQ 2,t (16)\nMoreover wind power causes ﬂuctuation mostly in active\npower. Fluctuations in active power, according to (\n16), will\nnot lead to a signiﬁcant voltage ﬂuctuations when the X/R\nratio of the external grid is high.\nIn Fig.\n7 and Fig.8, the aim is to show how wind power\ncan contribute to a decrease in the number of tap changes in\nsome days. But wind power do also contribute to an increase\nin the number of tap changes on some other days. However,\nin this case, wind power has led to the reduction in the total\nnumber of tap changes.\nC. The frequency of tap changes for varying level of wind\npower and grid strength\nThe analysis in the previous section is done assuming the\nshort circuit capacity (SCC) and the X/R ratio of the external\ngrid to be 171 MV A and 10 respectively. For this DS, it is\nseen that wind power does not pose a signiﬁcant threat to the\nFTC. In fact, it may reduce the FTC. In this subsection the\nsame investigation is done for grids with different SCCs and\nwith varying X/R ratios.\nFig.\n9 shows the trend in FTC as the power penetration\nlevel increases for grids with different SCC. The ﬁgure shows\nthat, overall, the FTC increases with decrease in SCC. This is\nunderstandable as a higher impedance leads to a higher voltage\ndrop for a given loading condition. In other words, for the\nsame variation of transformer loading, the voltage variation\nwill become larger in a weaker grid.\nOn the other hand, it may incorrectly be concluded from\nFig.\n9 that wind power contributes to reduction in the FTC.\n1In this equationR and X can be considered the resistance and reactance\nof the transformer plus the external grid. HenceΔU t is the voltage difference\nbetween the secondary side of the transformerU 2,t and the external gridU 1,t.\n6\n0 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n1100\nWind power as a percentage of the current installed capacity\nNumber of tap changes\n \n \nSCC=110 MVA\nSCC=80 MVA\nSCC=170 MVA\nSCC=140 MVA\nFig. 9: Number of tap changes per year for different SCC of external\ngrid with X/R=10.\nHowever that is not always the case. An analysis with a\ndifferent reference voltage, e.g. 10.8kV , at the secondary\nside of the transformer has shown a different result. But no\nsigniﬁcant increase in FTC is observed.\nMoreover, the curves in the Fig.\n9 show similar proﬁle\nas the wind power penetration level increases. Multiple other\nanalyses (not shown here) have shown similar results. That is,\nthe overall percentage change in FTC with increasing wind\npower capacity is roughly the same whenever the SCC is\nvaried while keeping the X/R ratio constant. The reasoning\nfor this observation is as follows.\nA tap change occurs when there is a voltage change at\nthe secondary side of a transformer due to change in power\nﬂow. Hence one can roughly approximate the FTC to be\nproportional to the voltage change that occurs at each time\nstept due to power ﬂow changes.\nThe voltage change that occurred originally\n2 in Fig.9 due\nto load ﬂow changes is given by (16). Now due to wind power,\nthere is additional ﬂuctuation in active powerΔP2,t. Hence this\nﬂuctuation causes an additional voltage ﬂuctuationΔU 2,t at the\nsecondary side of the transformer which can be given by (17).\nThe percentage change in voltage change can thus be given\nby (\n18). Since the FTC is proportional to the voltage change\nat the transformer secondary, (19) follows from (18).\nΔU 2,t ≈ ΔP2,t× R (17)\nΔU 2,t\nΔU t\n= ΔP2,t\nP2,t+ Q 2,t×\n(\nX\n/\nR\n) × 100% (18)\nand\nΔFTC ∝ ΔP2,t\nP2,t+ Q 2,t×\n(\nX\n/\nR\n) × 100% (19)\nEquation (19) implies that the percentage change in FTC\nis proportional to the X/R ratio and is constant for a given\nX/R ratio irrespective of the SCC of the grid. However the\ntap change does not only depend on the voltage change at\nthe secondary side of the transformer but also whether the\nresulting voltage will be outside of the deadband. Hence based\non (\n19) one can only roughly expect the implications to hold.\nFig.9 proves the same.\n2when there is no wind power in the system\nThe above analysis shows that for X/R of 10 no signiﬁcant\nincrease in the FTC is expected due to introduction of wind\npower operating at unity power factor. Fig.\n10 provides the\nresults of the analysis with different X/R ratios. The results\nshow that when the X/R ratio gets lower the effect of wind\npower on the FTC changes becomes considerable. This is clear\nfrom (\n19) that for a given active power change, the lower the\nX/R ratio the bigger is the change in FTC.\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1600\n1800\n2000\n2200\n2400\n2600\n2800\nWind power as a percentage of the current installed capacity\nNumber of tap changes\nX/R=10\nX/R=2.5\nX/R=1\nX/R=0.5\nX/R=5\nFig. 10: Number of tap changes per year in a DS connected to 80\nMV A external grid having different X/R ratio.\nBased on the analysis so far and using Fig.\n10, it can be\nconcluded that for distribution networks with X/R ratio greater\nthan 5 there is no real danger of increase in FTC due to wind\npower. But for distribution networks with X/R ratio less than\n5, there could be some problems of increase in FTC due to\nwind power introduction. This is especially true for those grids\nwith X/R ratio less than 2.5.\nHence, when planning wind power connection, the DSOs\nof such DSs need to pay attention to the effect of wind power\non the tap changers. The DSOs need to ﬁnd ways to deal with\nthis problem. The current practice is to extend the deadband\nof the tap changer, say from 1.2% to 1.6% or more. However\nthis solution may pose voltage quality problems. In the next\nsubsection we investigate the use of reactive power from the\nwind turbines to decrease the FTC.\nD. Using reactive power compensation to reduce the number\nof tap changes\nAmong the available wind turbines in the network, a wind\nfarm composed of four 0.8 MW wind turbines is chosen to\nprovide reactive power support to the grid. These wind turbines\nare variable speed design (full converter based) from Enercon\nand are recently installed at a site close to the substation.They\nstarted production as of March 2011. The wind power from\nthe rest of the wind turbines is aggregated with the load. The\nsimpliﬁed diagram of the resulting system is shown in Fig.\n11.\nThe majority of grid codes require that wind turbines should\nhave a capability of operating between 0.95 PF lagging and\nleading at full production [\n21]. This indicates that, for these\n7\nSlutarp\nsubstation\nMönarp6\n800kWMönarp3\n800kW\nMönarp4\n800kW\nMönarp5\n800kW\nInfinite grid\n2.315km/c61/c108\nFig. 11: Simpliﬁed diagram of the 10 kV distribution network.\nwind turbines, the rated power of the converter should be at\nleast ﬁve percent higher than the full power output of the wind\nturbines. HenceSmax\ni , for each wind turbine, is taken to be ﬁve\npercent higher than the rated power output.\nFig.\n12 compares the number of tap changes with and\nwithout RPC when the wind turbines are controlled to operate\nbetween 0.95 lagging and leading power factor so as to avoid\na tap change whenever possible.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nNumber□of□tap□changes\nTime\nWith□NO□RC□(total=410) With□RC□(0.95□pf)(total=324)\nFig. 12: Number of tap changes on 24hr basis with and without\nreactive power compensation.\nThe ﬁgure shows a decrease in the FTC by 21%. From the\nﬁgure it is clear that RPC can be used to effectively alleviate\nthe voltage regulating stress from the transformer tap changer.\nReactive power is consumed at light load or at windy\nconditions when there is a potential tap up-regulation. This\nbrings down the voltage at the substation busbar and avoids\nan up-regulation of the tap. Reactive power is supplied to boost\nthe voltage during high loading condition to avoid a potential\ntap down-regulation. In this way, reactive power contributes\nto the reduction in the number of tap changes.\nIt can be seen that RPC sometimes only delays a tap change\nto a later time. This is seen in Fig.\n12 when the number of tap\nchanges decreases at 23:00 while the number of tap changes\nincreases at 00:00. However, this delay of tap changes does not\nappear to be a signiﬁcant issue. Moreover, it could be reduced\nif accurate load and wind power forecasts are available.\nTable\nI summarizes the main points that can be used in\nthe comparative analysis of using RPC to reduce the FTC. It\nalso includes results from some more scenario analysis. The\nresults in Table\nI are for a grids with SCC=171 MV A and\nX/R=10. TableIIprovides the results of the same analysis for\na weaker grid having SCC=80 MV A and X/R=1. Moreover in\nTable\nI and II, the wind turbines are located 2.3 km from the\nsubstation. On the other hand, TableIIIprovides the results of\nthe same analysis for wind turbines located 15 km from the\nsubstation. The analysis with longer distance is used to seeif\nthe magnitude of the impedance between the wind farm and\nthe substation has some effect on the proposed solution. Over\nall, the results provided in Table\nI-IIIshows that RPC can be\nused for reducing the FTC in any grid.\nTABLE I: Effect of using reactive power compensation to reduce the\nFTC in a distribution system connected to a stronger grid (SCC=171\nMV A, X/R=10)\nCase Φ min\nChange in the\nFTC ( ΔFTC)\nAverage\npower Loss\n(kW)\nAverage reactive\npower from the wind\nturbines (kV Ar)\nΔFTC % ΔFTC\n1 1 0 0 16 0\n2 0.95 -86 -21 16 15\n3 0.90 -124 -30 16 25\n4 0.80 -166 -40 16 36\n5 0 -410 -100 14 176\nTABLE II: Effect of using reactive power compensation to reduce the\nFTC in a distribution system connected to a weaker grid (SCC=80\nMV A and X/R=1)\nCase Φ min\nChange in the\nFTC ( ΔFTC)\nAverage\npower Loss\n(kW)\nAverage reactive\npower from the wind\nturbines (kV Ar)\nΔFTC % ΔFTC\n1 1 0 0 86 0\n2 0.95 -394 -22 85 33\n3 0.90 -502 -28 85 64\n4 0.80 -663 -37 85 121\n5 0.0 -1 738 -97 91 724\nTABLE III: Reactive power compensation from wind turbines located\n15 km away from the substation (SCC=171 MV A, X/R=10)\nCase Φ min\nChange in the\nFTC ( ΔFTC)\nAverage\npower Loss\n(kW)\nAverage reactive\npower from the wind\nturbines (kV Ar)\nΔFTC | % ΔFTC\n1 1 0 0 28 0\n2 0.95 -90 -22 28 16\n3 0.90 -120 -29 28 25\n4 0.80 -166 -40 28 36\n5 0.0 -416 -100 27 176\nIn terms of achieving a speciﬁc level of reduction in the\nFTC, the distance of wind turbines from the substation has\nno effect at all. That is, almost the same amount of reactive\npower is necessary to achieve the same level of reduction in\nthe FTC. Thus, the cable does not make any signiﬁcant impact\non the reactive power requirement from the wind turbines.\nHowever, compared to strong grids, in weak grids more\nreactive power is required from the wind turbines to achieve\nthe same level of reduction in FTC. This is because, in weak\ngrids, higher number of tap changes need to be avoided to\nachieve the same percentage of reduction in the FTC.\nGenerally, the change in the network loss relative to the base\ncase (Case 1) is found to be negligible in all cases except in\nCase 5 of Table\nII. This is evident from the fact that, in this\ncase, the network resistance is relatively large and the amount\nof reactive power consumed or produced by the wind turbines\nrelatively high.\n8\nFinally, the analysis presented in this paper is carried out\nassuming constant power loads however similar results are\nobtained assuming constant impedance load.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper an analysis of the effect of wind power on\nthe FTC is carried out. In general, for distribution networks\nconnected to external grids withX /R ≥ 5, no signiﬁcant\neffect on the FTC is seen due to introduction of wind power.\nHowever, in a DS connected to grids with lower X/R ratio\nwind power can affect the FTC signiﬁcantly as wind power\npenetration increases.\nAn analysis is done to decrease the FTC using RPC from\nthe wind turbines. Two types of DSs are considered: one\nconnected to relatively strong (SCC=171 MV A, X/R= 10)\nexternal grid and the other to weak (SCC=80 MV A, X/R=\n1) external grid. The results show that RPC can be used\nto effectively reduce the FTC in both cases. However, the\nreactive power required to reduce the FTC by a speciﬁc percent\ndepends on the SCC and the X/R ratio. The reactive power\nrequirement decreases with higher SCC and X/R ratio.\nA further investigation on RPC is carried out for wind farms\nlocated farther from the substation. However, the change in\nreactive power requirement and network loss is found to be\nonly minor. Hence the RPC method is found to be effective\neven when wind farms are far away from the substation.\nFinally the practical implementation of RPC to reduce the\nnumber of tap changes depends on the maintenance cost of\nthe tap changers involved, the cost of reactive power from the\nwind turbines, and the change in power loss that occurs within\nthe network due to RPC.\nV.
