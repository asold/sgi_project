INTRODUCTION  \nIn early 2020 the world was hit by Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which affected \nglobal life. All people with various backgrounds and fields of science discuss COVID -19 pandemic, both \nthrough social media and web news. Likewise, with data scientists, several studies primarily related to natural \nlanguage processing (NLP) on COVID -19 also began to be carried out . Such as predictive models that can \nestimate returns on stocks from countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic [1], also modeled causality \nusing neural networks to explore misinformation on social media during the COVID -19 pandemic [2]. As far \nas our observation, none of these studies related to the COVID -19 news document has been done previously. \nMeanwhile, one of the news media trends recently is the publication of news documents about COVID -19, \nwhich was released quickly and updated every day, so that the release resulted in a lot of data and news about \nthe COVID-19. This was proofed by the search results from the Google search engine that gave a lot of output \nabove 6 billion documents for COVID-19 keywords that are accessed in July 2020. This is a challenge in how \n\nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control   \n \nSummarization of COVID-19 news documents deep learning-based using… (Nur Hayatin) \n755 \nto be able to find the relevant information from the document collection, especially from the news documents. \nNews documents are one of the many unstructured d ata that are found and easily accessed on the internet. \nMultiple types of data that are scattered on the internet, including news documents, increase rapid  \ngrowth [3, 4] and increase exponentially [4]. With the rapid growth of data, the summarization of information \nbecomes important to meet the needs of internet users.  In summarizing documents, two types can be used, \nnamely abstractive and extractive. An extractive summary is a concise text method which consists of three \nstages: text representation, sentence evaluation, and sentence selection using a statistical model [5]. Abstractive \nsummarization works by producing new sentences in summary based on an existing text by repeating new \nwords as an extraction act [6]. \nSeveral studies on abstractive news summar ies using deep learning have been done previously. \nAbstractive summarizations were conducted on the Chinese news dataset using public opinion [7]. Meanwhile, \nother research focused on the keywords that exist in the text sentences that can work effectively to produce \ninterpreted texts [8]. The other model that was used for abstractive news summary is sequence modeling, such \nas long short-term memory (LSTM) and recurrent neural network (RNN). The sequence to sequence the RNNs \nmodel has successfully reduced th e training loss for abstractive summary used amazon fine food reviews \ndataset [9]. Unfortunately, the maximum output of long text provides incorrectly . The research provide s a \ncorrect summary only for short text. Another study also conducted experiments by  doing a combination of \nlocal attention and LSTM in which the results of the summarization of the characters repeatedly appeared so \nthat the resulting sentences were less organized and the recall value obtained was low [10]. However, the \nrepetitive workings found in the recurrent model like RNN and LSTM, prevent the model from conducting \nparallel training and limit the ability to know context with longer input sequences  [11].  \nTransformer, as base language models, has significantly impacted the NLP research  field to replace \nthe deficiency of both LSTM , CNN and RNN based as a deep learning architecture  [12, 13], so that many \nreasons why the transformer was chosen as base model architecture. Various studies applied to transformer \narchitecture have been carried out and have improved results significantly in document summarization [14]. In \nprevious studies, transformers was used as a detection irony grouping in  Spanish using pre -training Twitter \nword research results compared to LSTM attention, and the deep averaging network showed an increase \nsignificantly on performances  [15]. The transformer also succeeded in making Chinese story -generation by \ncreating two layers of self-attention and reducing the number of encoder and decoder layers to identic one. The \nresults showed a low loss and an increase significantly from the base layer of the transformer model [16]. \nMeanwhile, the use of the transformer was carried ou t successfully using a combined modification of the  \nbidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as a transformer-based encoder and decoder in \nJapanese abstractive summarization, which has resulted in good average accuracy and the lowest loss value [17]. \nIn this study, we propose a transformer-based model to summarize COVID-19 news with several methods and \nstages. Another discussion from the result is present by make sublayer modifications to determine the effect of \nparameters on the encoder and decoder layers. \n \n \n2. DATASET \nThe dataset we used came from news documents about COVID-19 that was published on the Kaggle \nplatform [18] from the Canadian broadcasting corporation (CBC) news site, with a total number of documents \nthat were used to build the model is 2755 documents. The relevance of the news in the dataset containing \nvariations combined topics related to COVID -19 are processed using the crawler with the keyword  \nCOVID-19 published from January 08, 2020, until March 03, 2020.  In the dataset, there are text description \ncontains the news content, and the description feature is a summary of the news content. Specific keywords in \nnews content are listed in the word coronavirus. There is a variety of mixed news content, but the news content \nis more important in the amount of COVID-19 growth in each region. \n \n \n3. PREPROCESSING \nSeveral previous studies have shown the results of their research by doing preprocessing can increase \naccuracy results by a percentage of 2%  [19], preprocessing is also used in some words that have the form of \nmisspellings [20]. At the preprocessing stage, several processes occur.  i.e., contractions, lowercasing & \nprintable checks, splitting data, tokenization, and word embedding. We divide the dataset into three forms, i.e., \ntraining, validation,  and testing, with percentages of 70%, 10%,  and 20%, respectively. Contractions and \nprintable checks, mapped out contraction words from the list of word contractions. These words were defined \nby ourselves to get the original form terms such as \"don't\" become \"do not,\" then printable check used to delete \ncharacters other than punctuation marks, and ASCII letters. After that,  due to memory limitations we did \ndistribute control to limit text which was needed as a  training model. Furthermore, tokenization is the process \n               ISSN: 1693-6930 \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control, Vol. 19, No. 3, June 2021:  754 - 761 \n756 \nof breaking text into separate word s and adding unique tokens. In the modification of the model, we use a  \npre-trained word embedding global vector (GloVe) with a vocabulary of 2.2  M to present each word in a  \n300-dimensional vector size [21]. Previous studies have shown that unsupervised comparison results based on \ntext summarization using word embedding are more effective than using a bag of words  [22]. \n \n \n4. TRANSFORMER MODEL \nWe analy zed in Figure 1, and there are encoder and decoder layer s that have the dropout and \nNormalization in each sublayer. We use of gaussian error linear unit (GELU) in the feed -forward network is \nused only once on each encoder or decoder layer, due to GELU has high complexity in the NLP field but the \nperformance produced is superior compared to other activation functions such as ELU and ReLU  [23]. The \nmulti-head attention formulation can be seen following in (1) [14]. h is the total attention carried out in parallel \nso that every ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖  is carried out the attention function contained in (2) [14]. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Transformer model proposed \n \n \n𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑1, … , ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑ℎ )𝑊𝑂    (1) \n \nℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖 =  𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑄𝑊𝑖\n𝑄 , 𝐾𝑊𝑖\n𝐾, 𝑉𝑊𝑖\n𝑉)       (2) \n \n𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(\n𝑄𝐾𝑇\n√𝑑𝑘\n)      (3) \n \nThe attention function can be defined as a function that performs the mapping of the query Q is the \ntarget sequence; the key pair K and the value V are derived from the sequence. Each Q, K, V , and output \nmapping are defined in vector form. The weight of ea ch calculated value is a representation of adjusting the \nquery to the key. The query and key dimensions are defined as 𝑑𝑘, and the values dimension 𝑑𝑣 is used as the \nAttention parameter found in (3) [14]. Multi-head attention combines several attenti on models to each of the \n𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉 models. The weighting dimension of a sequence is defined as 𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙  so that its representation is in \nmulti-head 𝑊𝑂 ∈  ℝ𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙×𝑑𝑘 . The primary difference between a masked multi -head attention and a  \nmulti-head attention is that some tokens contained in a sequence are randomly removed to train the model to \nunderstand the context contained in the sequence. Transformer also performs positional encoding (𝑃𝐸), which \nis the injection of some information on each wo rd position contained in a sequence. PE has the same \ndimensions as 𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 . In this paper, we use sine -cosine positional encoding, where the formula equation can \nbe seen in (4) and (5), the pos is a position, and i is dimension.  \n \n𝑃𝐸(𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖) = sin (\n𝑝𝑜𝑠\n10000\n2𝑖\n𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙\n)      (4) \n\nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control   \n \nSummarization of COVID-19 news documents deep learning-based using… (Nur Hayatin) \n757 \n𝑃𝐸(𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖+1) = cos (\n𝑝𝑜𝑠\n10000\n2𝑖\n𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙\n)       (5) \n \nDropout reduces the loss value during the training process,  also helps prevent overfitting  [24]. The \nnormalization layer normalized values come from the hidden layer. Perform on small batch sizes dependent to \nreduce memory cost, normalization can rely for increase training accuracy  [25]. The normalization layer \nminimize parameter change during propagated through the deep networks  [26]. \n \n \n5. SCORING \nThe summarization result measurements are performed using recall-oriented understanding for gisting \nevaluation (ROUGE) [27]. We chose the ROUGE -N method, which was represented in (6), in which the \ncalculation is based on n-gram recall [27]. Where n is the length of n-gram, Ref is a set of reference summaries. \n𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ(𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑛) is the calculation of the maximum number of n -grams co-occurring on the generated \nsummaries model and the set of reference summaries. 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡(𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑛) is the number of n -grams in reference \nsummaries. \n \n𝑅𝑂𝑈𝐺𝐸 − 𝑁 =\n Σ\n𝑆∈𝑅𝑒𝑓\nΣ\n 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑛∈𝑆 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ(𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑛)\n Σ\n𝑆∈𝑅𝑒𝑓\nΣ\n 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑛∈𝑆 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡(𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑛)\n     (6) \n \n \n6. EXPERIMENT AND DISCUSSION \nIn accordance with Figure 2, the experiment from all transformer summarization models that we build \nfirst performed preprocessing on the text. The use of preprocessing is to reduce less relevant features, and the \namount of memory needed to carry out the training process  [28]. Then after preprocessing, we perform all \nmodels transformer-based architecture with encoder and decoder that can be done several times repeatedly and \nmake a comparison of layer modifications based on scoring. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.

Software and splitting \nThe specifications in the experiment used Google colab cloud computing with data as follows: Intel \nXeon CPU 2.20GHz, 14GB RAM, Tesla P100 16GB GPU. The Python TensorFlow library is used as a deep \nbackend learning where calculations are performed on the GPU. The results of splitting on the COVID-19 news \ndocument dataset were 1928 documents to conduct training, 275 documents as validation during the training \nprocess, and 552 documents to test the results of the training model, for each training model. Validating perform \nunder a batch of 32 documents to calculate the average ROUGE-1 score and loss value. The maximum length \nof the news text content of the entire training document was equal to 600 and 25 in the text description. \n\n               ISSN: 1693-6930 \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control, Vol. 19, No. 3, June 2021:  754 - 761 \n758 \n6.2.  Experiment scenario \nIn this research experiment, we use Adam which is the stochastic based optimization method to update \nthe weight value of the loss value measurement results  [29], where the calculation of the loss value of the \nweight value used sparse s oftmax cross-entropy. Table 1 shown the experiment scenario of several different \nparameters used to build the transformer deep learning model. Adam optimization parameters used are  \nbeta1=0.9, beta2=0.98, epsilon=1e -9. All models had carried out fairly ite rations of 40 epochs on training \nexperiments. From the existing transformer design model in previous studies, we chose the transformer C \nmodel (TCM) [14] as a comparison test with some of the models that we proposed. The selection is because \nTCM has the most straightforward design and the results of trials with other architectures that are more complex \nby 1%. The model that we proposed includes tokenization and word embedding, and in the form of parameter \nchanges modification of the encoder -decoder layer, or can be called a modified base model transformer with \ndistribute c ontrol tokenization and GloVe word embedding . The postfix number is a representation of the \nnumber of identical layer encoder decoders (MTDTG Nx). The activation function in the MTDTG model which \nwas used in this research is  the GELU function to calculate the weight of the sequence in the feed -forward \nlayer, whereas in previous studies using ReLU as an activation function. \n \n \nTable 1.

Experiment result \nDuring the training process, a loss value and ROUGE-1 is obtained, as shown in Figure 3. TCM has \ndecreased loss in epoch 40, so that a loss value of 6.3 is obtained.  In other models ranging from epoch 18 -27 \nloss in MTDTG 2 gradually decreased at 5.5, then climbed back up because of the variant batch in the document \nvary, so that the model must recognize new data again. Other models as shown in Figure 3 (a), the graph depicts \nthat the MTDTG 5 decreased gradually in loss at epoch 10 and 25 with obtained loss value of 4.8. The latest \nresults of our experiment on MTDTG 6 have decreased a loss value to 4.7 which is not much different compared \nto MTDTG 5 with a difference of 0.1%.  During the training phase, each epoch validation based on maximum \nROUGE-1 score is considered to save the weight model.  This experiment used ROUGE-1 to summarization \nresult measure, the result of ROUGE-1 was shown by Figure 3 (b). The graph explained the validation process \nwhere each epoch TCM has a maximum score 0.20. Our proposed model shown by MTDTG 2, MDTG 5, and \nMTDTG 6, those models have an outperformed result measured by ROUGE -1 with score 0.54, 0.59, and  \n0.60 respectively. \n \n \n \n(a)  (b) \n \nFigure 3. Comparison; (a) model training loss and (b) ROUGE-1 score validation  \n \n \n6.4.  Summarization model \nWe try to explore the results of MTDTG 6, on the word cloud, as seen in Figure 4. Word cloud \ndescribes the  word frequency representation of the whole document from the generated summarization \nconducted by MTDTG 6. Total all unique words while performing summarization appeared in Figure 4 is 200 \n\nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control   \n \nSummarization of COVID-19 news documents deep learning-based using… (Nur Hayatin) \n759 \nwords that used the MTDTG 6 model. Most word generated on summarization is ‘say’, this result is caused by \nthe dataset used related to news content to get information from an interview on experts or government officials. \nThe word \"Canadian\" also appeared, because this word related to the news that has been reported mostly on \nCanadian during the coronavirus situation. \nWe classified keyword based on frequent of appearance. On Table 2, there are two types of keyword: \n\"most\" (keywords have a high frequent), and \"least\"  (keywords appeared rarely). The percentage of overall \nword cloud summarization results from Figure 4 is seen the table. The most 5 words that have high an appear \nfrequency are \"say, will, coronavirus, people, pandemic\".  These keywords prove that the main topic of news \nreported widely during this period is about the corona virus pandemic. It caused the go vernment of Canada to \ntake policies focused on public health which concerned with the safety of citizens. The other hand, the fewest \n5 words found: \"families, disease, grocery store, first nation, stock market\". The main thing that had been less \nconcern from report news is that the coronavirus pandemic affected the weak of many sectors, including trading \nand economy, and also less reported about the policy issue to close public places i.e. park and store.   \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

Testing model \nThe distribution of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores on MTDTG 6 is shown in Figure 5, the number \nof summarization results is at most 80 -100% with a total of 209 documents, while at least 10% is scored with \na total of 33 documents. Inversely pr oportional to ROUGE-2, where the most distribution in the result of the \nscore is in the 0-20% because ROUGE-2 uses the bigram mechanism. So, there are several overlapping words \nbetween summarization and references. The comparison results  test also  shown in  Table 3. The results of \nMTDTG 5 and MTDTG 6 on the ROUGE-1 score have a difference of 1% when used on the ROUGE-2 score. \nThere is quite a difference of 3%. The evaluation results show that MTDTG 6 with a ROUGE -1 score of 0.58 \nand a ROUGE-2 score of 0.42 is the best model that can be used in the test data. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5. Distribution ROUGE score on test documents \n\n               ISSN: 1693-6930 \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control, Vol. 19, No. 3, June 2021:  754 - 761 \n760 \nFrom the results of the entire trial of the test document, there is only MTDTG 6 architecture that can be \nsupplied with the maximum due to the memory limitations handled by the GPU. In the experiment, the researcher \noften got constraints on out of memory ( OOM) resources. This obstacle can be overcome by reducing the \narchitectural design model, especially the most important things, i.e., the number of feed-forward networks, batch \nsize, and the number of encoder-decoders. The disadvantage of MTDTG 6 is that the memory needed to conduct \ntraining is more significant because we use 300-dimensional GloVe as word embedding. However, the results of the \ntest model can increase by a percentage of 13% in ROUGE-1 and 16% ROUGE-2 compared to TCM. \n \n \nTable 3.

CONCLUSION \nSummarization of news documents COVID-19 based on deep learning using transformer architecture \ncan be done by compiling various models and methods of activation functions. We proposed the transformer \nwith architectural modification as the basis for designi ng the model in abstractive document summarization, \nwhich was evidently effective in improving result performance. The best model MTDTG 6 performs that was \nmeasured using the ROUGE-1, and ROUGE-2 has obtained a good score of 0.58 and 0.42, respectively, wi th \na training time of 11438 seconds. Based on word clouds from all documents with the most discussion, we found \nthat the most reported in news related to the policy and regulation from the government on public health \nservices prioritization during COVID -19 pandemic. Since the research of COVID -19 news document \nabstractive summaries is minimal, many research opportunities can be done further by modifying the encoder \nand decoder layer to get better model quality results, and they also work with faster trainin g time. The \nintegration of several transformer architecture models can also be done, such as the use of the T5 or BART \nmodels to summarize until the quality of existing research can be evaluated or compared.  \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] A.
