INTRODUCTION \nTransient overvoltages, short -circuit withstands \ncapability, basic insulation level, and other important factors \nof the power system depend on the neutral grounding. The \nimpedance to ground faults can be decreased by using \ngrounding transformers. The level of gro und fault current \ncan also be decreased by using the grounding transformers. \nTwo main configurations of three -phase grounding \ntransformers are: \n \nManuscript received 3 June, 2021; accepted 1 February, 2022.  \nThis research was supported by the TUBİTAK under Grant No. \n118C109; Istanbul Technical University Bilimsel Araştırma Projeleri under \nGrant No. MGA-2020-42527. \n Interconnected star or zigzag connections; \n Wye-delta grounding transformer. \nZigzag transformers are preferred du e to their lower cost \nand smaller size for the same value of the zero -sequence \nimpedance in wye -delta grounding transformers. Zigzag \ntransformers are found everywhere in the contemporary \nworld. As their number increases, accurate calculation of \nleakage rea ctance becomes an important issue in \nmaintaining the comfortable working of the zigzag \ntransformer.  \nThe zigzag transformer is built with copper windings, a \nsoft magnetic material ( silicon steel), and high -end \ninsulation materials. Leakage reactance is one  of the most \nimportant parameters of the zigzag transformer because the \nmain purpose of the zigzag transformer is to provide a low \nleakage reactance to give a path for zero sequence \ncomponents during the fault conditions. Using finite \nelement models and an alytical equations, a variety of \nchanges can be made to the geometry and ampere -turns of \nthe zigzag transformer to optimize the impact of leakage \nreactance and fulfilling the customer requirements.  The \nvoltage increase in the unfaulted phases is also preve nted by \nthe zigzag transformer. \nZigzag transformers are also known as interconnected \nstar windings , and the zigzag transformer has some \ncharacteristics of the delta and the star connection, and the \nadvantages of both delta and star connections. \nZigzag transformers are used as a grounding transformer; \nthe main advantages of the zigzag transformer for the power \nsystems are [1]–[5]: \n The z igzag transformer performs harmonic mitigation \nand terminates harmonics. The zigzag transformer can be \nused in a power syste m to trap triplet harmonic currents , \ni.e., 3rd, 9th, 15th, and 21st harmonics. Zigzag transformers \nare installed near the loads that produce higher triplet \nharmonic currents and minimize the undesirable effects of \nthe triplet harmonic. \n Zigzag transformers provide cheaper grounding on the \ntransformers. It helps components of the power system \nand decreases the stress of the voltage under the fault \ncurrents. The zigzag transformer also provides insulation \nComparison of Analytical Method and Different \nFinite Element Models for the Calculation of \nLeakage Inductance in Zigzag Transformers \nKamran Dawood1, *, Fatih Isik2, Guven Komurgoz1 \n1Department of Electrical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University,  \nMaslak, 34467 Sariyer, Istanbul, Turkey \n2Research & Development Director, Astor Transformers,  \n34906, Ankara, Turkey \nkamransdaud@yahoo.com \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j02.eie.29238 \n16\nELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA, ISSN 1392-1215, VOL. 28, NO. 1, 2022 \nbetween the power system components and the ground , \nso that the power system components may not be affected \nby the fault current. \n Due to the low internal winding impedance, zigzag \ntransformers are more effective for grounding purpose s \nand provide a better solution for grounding the power \nsystem. Zigzag transfo rmers have a low leakage \nimpedance value , which allows the triple -harmonics of \nthe excitation current and the zero -sequence currents to \nflow through it because there is no opposition to their \nflow except the small value of the leakage reactance of \nthe zigzag transformers. \nThe l eakage reactance in the transformer can be \ncalculated with analytical techniques, numerical methods, \nand experimental tests. The l eakage reactance of the \ntransformer can also be calculated by using the reluctance \nnetwork modeling [6].  \nNumerical techniques are accurate , but this method is \ntime-consuming. Reluctance network modeling is faster but \nless accurate as compared to the numerical method. Due to \nthe higher accuracy , compared to the other analytical \nmethod, the Rogowski method is  one of the efficient \nanalytical techniques that can be used effectively to evaluate \nleakage reactance [7].  \nThe change in the dimension of the transformer winding \ncan significantly affect the leakage reactance, result ing in \nthe change in the short-circuit current and the short-circuit \nimpedance of the transformer [ 8]. The s ize of the internal \nwinding can also be determined by leakage reactance [ 9]. \nMagnetic traps to harmonics are also affected by the leakage \nreactance [ 10]. In [11]–[18], different analytic al methods \nand finite element models  are presented to evaluate leakage \nreactance in the different types of winding connections. \nHowever, a comparison of the different methods for \nevaluating leakage reactance applied to zigzag configuration \ntransformers for determining the accuracy of these methods \nis still missing. Hence, this work explains the determination \nof the leakage reactance in the zigzag transformer in detail, \ni.e., the calculation of  the leakage reactance by analytical \nmethods and the finite eleme nt method. Furthermore, \nseveral finite element models are compared for the accurate \ncalculation of the leakage reactance. \nDifferent magnetostatic analysis and transient analysis are \nperformed to evaluate the accuracy of the finite element \nanalysis for valu es of the leakage reactance and no -load \nlosses in the zigzag transformers. For the estimation of the \nleakage reactance four different models are used , namely, \nthree-phase three -dimensional, single-phase three -\ndimensional, three-phase two-dimensional, and single-phase \ntwo-dimensional. The analytical method is derived from the \navailable analytical equations and the results of the \nanalytical method are also compared and investigated by \nfinite element simulations and experimental tests. \nII. REACTANCE IN ZIGZAG TRANSFORMERS \nAs a consequence of international standards and \nmanufacturing tolerances, leakage reactance calculation is \none of the important subjects for transformer designers. One \nimportant question for transformer designers is how \ndifferent parameters affect  the overall leakage reactance of \nthe zigzag transformer. In this paper, a comparative study of \na leakage reactance calculation for the zigzag transformer is \npresented. \nThe short -circuit performance of the transformer is also \nrelated to the leakage reactan ce. The leakage reactance \ndepends on the ampere -turns and geometry of the \ntransformer, all of which can be analy sed by using an \nanalytical method or numerical method. Evaluating leakage \nreactance in the zigzag transformer using analytical and \nnumerical tec hniques saves time, reduces the number of \nexperiments, and prototypes. These methods can accurately \npredict the leakage reactance within the zigzag transformer , \nwhich contributes to optimization of the overall zigzag \ntransformer design. \nFor the flow of the  positive and negative sequence \ncurrents, zigzag connections pose a high magnetization \nimpedance. However, to improve the flow of triple -\nharmonics and zero -sequence currents, zigzag transformers \nhave a lower leakage reactance because they provide a path \nfor zero -sequence currents coming from ground faults. \nZero-sequence currents in the power system come mainly \nfrom unbalanced loads and faults involving grounding. That \nis why it is in the great er interest of the zigzag transformer \ndesigners to give an accura te value of the leakage reactance \nand guarantee leakage inductance levels in the range of the \ninternational standards. The IEC 60076 –1 standard \nmandates tolerance of ±10  % for zigzag transformers.  \nEquation (1) shows the Rogowski method for the evaluation \nof leakage reactance [13]: \n \neq\n2πµN oX2 π×f  × ATD,\nH\n   (1) \n \n     HV HL HL LVLVHV\n11ATD = + +  ,BD Β D B D33    (2) \nwhere N, f, ATD, µ o, BHV, BHL, and B LV are the number of \nturns in the high voltage winding , frequency, ampere -turn \ndensity, free space permeability, radial depth of the high \nvoltage winding, the gap between low voltage  (LV) and \nhigh voltage (HV) windings, and LV winding .

NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES \nDue to the limitations of analytical methods, the use of \nnumerical technique s for the solution of electromagnetic, \nmagnetic, and electrostatic field problems is increasing day \nby day [19]–[21]. Numerical analysis can solve the irregular \nand comp lex geometrie and non -linear electric machine \nmaterials more appropriately as compared to the analytical \nmethod.  \nFinite element analysis is one of the most commonly used \nnumerical techniques fo r solving magnetostatic problems. \nThe finite element method ca n be used for the solution of \ndifferential equations in engineering fields such as \nmagnetostatic analysis, thermal analysis, electromagnetic \nanalysis, acoustics and vibration analysis, mechanics and \nstructural analysis, fluid mechanic analysis, and transie nt \nanalysis. In the finite element method, the solution mainly \ndepends on the type of problem (mechanical, \nelectromagnetic, linear, nonlinear, and thermal) and the type \nof software used for the computation. Nevertheless, the \ngeneral structure is common to all finite element methods \nand can be divided into the three steps: \n Pre-processing; \n Processing; \n Post-processing. \nIn the pre -processing, the problem is defined. The first \nprocess of the pre -processing is to draw the geometry of the \nstructure or problem whic h is needed to be solved and \nassign the suitable material properties for each of the \nobjects. The finite element methods subdivide a geometry \ninto simpler and smaller parts that are called “finite \nelements” and the main objective of the pre -processing in \nthe finite element method is to discretize the structure into \nsmaller elements and develop an appropriate finite element \nmesh. After mesh operation, the implementation of the \nboundary conditions and required contacts between the \ndifferent objects and model components is needed . For the \ntwo-dimensional problems, triangle - or rectangle -based \nmeshes can be used , and for the three -dimensional problem, \ntetrahedron meshes are preferred.  \nFigure 2 shows the steps of the pre-processing. \n \nFig. 2.  Pre-processing. \nIn the processing step, the problem is assembled into the \nsystem equations using computation al resources and an \nappropriate solution to the physical problem can be \nobtained. \nThe required solutions to the problem can be obtained in \nthe post-processing step. T he required solution and desired \nquantities (e.g. , electromagnetic field, transient analysis, \nelectrostatic field, stress, forces, temperature) can be \nrepresented by using plots, graphs, and tables. One of the \nmost benefits of using the finite element meth od is to \ninclude the visual representation by using graphs, plots, and \ntables. Figure 3 shows the different types of representation \nduring post-processing. \n \nFig. 3.  Post-processing. \nThe use of finite element analysis is increasing rapidly \ndue to its abil ity to solve real-world problems in a simple \nway. In transformer design, finite element analysis can be \nused to evaluate iron losses, copper losses, inrush current, \nvibration, stress, temperature, and electromagnetic forces. \nThe main aim of transformer des igners is to construct a \nhigh-quality transformer at the lowest possible cost. In the \nzigzag transformer, the working of the transformer is mainly \nbased on the leakage reactance. Designers of  zigzag \ntransformer can find the ideal value of the leakage react ance \nby changing the dimensions of the windings, the space \nbetween the windings, and the height of the windings.  \nMagnetostatic Problems . In transformers, leakage \nreactance, electromagnetic forces, inductance, capacitance, \nand other important factors invol ve magnetostatic problems. \nThe analysis of the magnetostatics problem  for the \nevaluation of the leakage reactance  can be divided into  four \nmain parts: \n Modelling and materials definition; \n Generating and refining mesh; \n Current excitation and boundary conditions; \n Analysing the results. \nOptimization of the transformer  design for performance \nand efficiency can be achieved by performing all the steps \nof the analysis properly. \nThe two Maxwell equations given below in differential \nform can be applied to magnetostatic problems: \n \n.B = 0,  (19) \n \n = J,H  (20) \nwhere J, H, and B are the electric current density, magnetic \nfield intensity, and magnetic flux density. The relationship \nbetween H and B in magnetic materials is given below \n \nB µ.H.  (21) \nIn the equation above, μ is the permeability . The \nferromagnetic materials, which are used in the \nmanufacturing of the transformer and reactor magnetic \ncircuits, possess a nonlinear B -H characteristic curve , and \nmagnetic flux density is a  function of the permeability and \nmagnetic field intensity of the magnetic material. For the \ncalculation of the leakage reactance, the permeability of the \nmagnetic material must be kept high , and during the \nsimulation, adding non -linear characteristics pro perties to \nthe core is not compulsory. However, during the evaluation \n19\nELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA, ISSN 1392-1215, VOL. 28, NO. 1, 2022 \nof the no -load and load losses, one must assign non -linear \nproperties to the core of the transformer.  \nUsing finite element methods, the leakage reactance of \nthe zigzag transformer can b e evaluated using the energy \nmethod.

ACCURACY OF ANALYTICAL METHOD AND FINITE \nELEMENT MODELS FOR THE LEAKAGE REACTANCE \nThis section will compare the experimental results of the \nprototype transformer with the finite element method and \nanalytical approach. The finite element results presented in \nthis paper were obtained using the program ANSYS \nMaxwell. For the evaluation of the leakage reactance by the \nfinite element method, four different models are used , \nnamely three -phase three -dimensional, one -phase three -\ndimensional, three-phase two-dimensional, and single-phase \ntwo-dimensional. Figures 4 and 5 show the mesh operation \nof the three -phase and single -phase two -dimensional \nmodels. The total number of mesh elements of t hree-phase \ntwo-dimensional and single -phase two -dimensional models \nare 40396 and 5950, respectively. \nTo validate the analytical method and numerical models, \nexperiments were performed  on the prototype transformer . \nExperimental measurements of the analy sed transformer \nwere performed in the test laboratory of the Astor \nTransformer Turkey, which is equipped with state -of-the-art \ntesting devices. \nFor measuring voltage, current, power, and short -circuit \nimpedance, the Yokogawa Electric WT500 power analyzer \nwas u sed. All the tests are carried out on the transformer \nfollowing the IEC-60076-1 standards. For the calculation of \nthe no -load losses, the rated voltage was applied to the \nprimary winding and other windings were open -circuited. A \nshort-circuit test on the t ransformer was performed to \ndetermine the leakage reactance of the transformer. \n \nFig. 4.

CORE LOSS CALCULATION. \nMethod Core loss (kW) \nFEM 2D 2079 \nExperimental 2020 \n \nThe difference between the finite element 2 -D three -\nphase model and the experimental method is less than 3 %. \nDuring the manufacturing of  the transformer, an accurate \ncalculation of short-circuit reactance is crucial because it \nincreases the credibility of the manufacturer and the \nreliability of the transformer. It also helps to reduce the cost \nand size of the material, since a smaller leakage impedance \ndesign margin can be used [ 22]. Transformer designers \nmainly rely on analytical formulas . However, the results \nshow that the finite element method is more reliable for \ncalculating the leakage reactance in the zigzag transformer. \nThe accurate calculation of the leakage reactance and \ncore losses using the finite element method not only helps to \nevaluate these parameters , but can also be used to optimize \nthe design of the zigzag transformer, which will also help to \nfulfil the customer requirements and international standards. \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nAppropriate calculation of the leakage reactance is vital \nfor transformer designers because the short -circuit current \nof the transformer  is mainly dependent on the leakage \nreactance. The overall cost of the transf ormer can also be \nminimized by appropriately calculating the leakage \nreactance.  \nIn this study, t he leakage reactance is calculated using \nexperimental tests, numerical techniques, and the analytical \nmethod. Several finite element models , namely 3-phase 3D, \n1-phase 3D, 3 -phase 2D, and 1 -phase 2D, are examined for \nleakage reactance , and these models have been compared \nwith the experimental test and analytical method. Among \nthe analytical techniques, the Rogowski method is used for \nthe evaluation of the leakag e reactance. On the other hand, \nprototype experiment tests are performed to find the exact \nsolution. By using analytical techniques, the leakage \nreactance can be calculated in a short time and without any \nfinancial problems as most of the finite element me thod \nsoftware is expensive and time -consuming. However, the \naccuracy of the finite element models is much higher than \nthat of the analytical method. \n21\nELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA, ISSN 1392-1215, VOL. 28, NO. 1, 2022 \nThis work will help researchers and transformer designers \nevaluate and understand different parameters of t he leakage \nreactance by using analytical formulas and finite element \nmodels. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe authors  thank the Astor Transformer Turkey for \nmaking the prototype of the transformer.  \nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST  \nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.  \nREFERENCES \n[1] P.
