This folk belief is \nwidespread among scientists too. In this line, human tool use is based on motor programs about \nhow the hand interacts with tools, implying that the use of end-effectors other than the hand should \ngenerate motor control difficulties (e.g., inability to reproduce a specific tool-use action over time), \nbecause these so-called programs characterize the spatiotemporal parameters of hand movements, but \nnot of other end-effectors. To test this, we asked participants to perform three tool-use actions (e.g., \npounding a nail) with four end-effectors (i.e., right foot, right elbow, left hand, right hand). We show \nthat participants not only spontaneously performed the tool-use actions effectively, but also crucially \nkept tools’ spatiotemporal parameters constant among the end-effectors. This phenomenon, which we \ncall poly-dexterity, is at odds with the view that the human brain stores hand-centered motor programs \nfor tool use. Poly-dexterity is instead consistent with the idea that, once the tool-use action is formed \nmentally, general motor programs can be applied to a variety of end-effectors. Reversing the usual \nevolutionary perspective, our findings support that, in the course of evolution, manual dexterity has \ncome after tool-use skills.\nWhile initially designed for primate arboreal locomotion\n1, the function of the hand progressively evolved in \nour ancestors, allowing us to develop manual dexterity useful for object-object manipulation and tool use (i.e., \nexaptation2). For some authors, it is the accuracy of manual actions uniquely afforded by the human hand that \nexplains why tool use skills remain limited in the animal kingdom2,3. Along the same lines, it has been assumed \nthat this high dexterity results not only from morphological modifications (e.g., opposable thumb 2), but also \nfrom changes within the brain 4. In humans, the left inferior parietal cortex is assumed to store specific motor \nprograms containing information about how the hand interacts with tools (e.g., for a hammer, a broad oscillation \nand a power grip\n4–11). The focus is heavily placed on the hand, corroborating the folk belief that tool use is synon-\nymous with manual, but not intellectual work. In broad terms, this manipulation-based approach advocates that \nhuman tool use might be unique because of the progressive development of manual dexterity – notably based on \nhand-centered motor programs (hereafter referred to as the hand-centered motor program hypothesis).\nThe manipulation-based approach is somewhat inconsistent with the frequent observation that individuals \nborn without arms can nevertheless use many tools with their feet in everyday life (e.g., eating with a fork). While \nthis observation may be interpreted as evidence that manual dexterity is not a prerequisite for tool use, it could \nalso be argued that such atypical behavior results from idiosyncratic neural plasticity and/or extended practice \nusing uncommon end-effectors. This suggests that, when an individual is born without arms, the tool-specific \nmotor programs usually used by ordinary people to specify the hand-centered spatiotemporal parameters are \nontogenetically recycled for the use of feet\n12. If this holds true, then in ordinary people this recycling process \nshould not take place spontaneously (e.g., from the first attempt to use feet as end-effectors), but should require \na certain amount of practice to enable brain plasticity, perhaps weeks or months\n13. After all, according to the \nhand-centered motor program hypothesis, tool-use motor programs characterize the spatiotemporal parameters \n1Laboratoire d’Etude des Mécanismes Cognitifs, Université de Lyon, 5, avenue Pierre Mendès-France, 69676, Bron \nCedex, France. 2Institut Universitaire de France, 103, Boulevard Saint-Michel, 75005, Paris, France. 3Integrative, \nMultisensory, Perception, Action, & Cognition Team, Centre de Recherche en Neurosciences de Lyon, INSERM-\nCNRS-Université de Lyon, 16, avenue Doyen Lépine, 69676, Bron Cedex, France. 4Mouvement, Handicap et Neuro-\nImmersion, Hospices Civils de Lyon et Centre de Recherche en Neurosciences de Lyon, Hôpital Henry Gabrielle, 20, \nroute de Vourles, 69230, St Genis Laval, France.

Therefore the use of end-effectors other than \nthe hand should generate substantial motor control difficulties (e.g., inability to reproduce a specific tool-use \naction over time). In other words, tools’ spatiotemporal parameters should not be kept constant when ordinary \npeople use tools for the very first time with different uncommon end-effectors.\nHere we sought to examine this hypothesis by asking 10 right-handed healthy participants to perform three \nreal tool-use actions (i.e., pounding a nail with a hammer, sweeping sawdust with a brush, painting with a roller) \nby using four different end-effectors in the following order: Right foot, right elbow, left hand, and right hand, i.e., \nfrom the least to the most frequently used. The experimental 3D motion analysis setup used to record the tools’ \nspatiotemporal parameters is depicted in Fig 1. Our analyses focused on four classical kinematic landmarks\n14,15 \n(Cycle duration; Maximum velocity of the forth movement; Peak acceleration of the forth movement; Peak decel-\neration of the forth movement) and one relevant spatial attribute (Vertical movement amplitude).\nResults\nAlthough participants felt more at ease with the hands than with the elbow or the foot, they were able to perform \nthe three tool-use actions in an effective way, irrespective of the end-effector used. For instance, on average, \nthe nail was pounded approximately 2.3 cm deep into the table, while this performance varied only moderately \namong the different end-effectors (M\nRight foot = 1.6 cm; SERight foot = 0.5 cm; MRight elbow = 2.2 cm; SERight elbow = 0.8 cm; \nMLeft hand = 3.0 cm; SELeft hand = 1.5 cm; MRight hand = 2.5 cm; SERight hand = 1.1 cm). A repeated measure ANOV A with \nEnd-Effector as within-subject factor revealed that there was no significant difference (F(3,27) = 0.47, p = 0.71), \nsuggesting that hammering performance was relatively comparable for the different end-effectors. The same was \ntrue for the brush and the roller (see Methods Section). Second, as expected, each tool was characterized by \nspecific spatiotemporal parameters, even if these were slightly modified by the biomechanical constraints of each \nend-effector (e.g., for the roller, peak acceleration was lower for the right elbow than for the other end-effectors; \nsee Fig. 2). The hammer’s motion was ample, with pronounced acceleration and deceleration phases. The roller’s \nmotion was the least ample vertically, was relatively slow, and did not have marked acceleration and deceleration \nphases. The brush’s motion was relatively similar to roller’s, but with a greater vertical amplitude.\nLet us now turn to the main result of this work. To test the hand-centered motor program hypothesis, we \ncomputed correlations between the four end-effectors for each tool and for each parameter of interest. The results \nare given in Table 1 and an illustration is provided in Fig. 3 for cycle duration and maximum velocity produced \nby the hammer. Overall, we found highly significant correlations between the end-effectors for each parameter \nof interest and for each tool (more than 88% of the correlations obtained were statistically significant, with more \nthan 70% above 0.80, and more than 57% above 0.90). The non-significant correlations found (about 12%) were \npositive and moderate (between 0.43 and 0.68).\nFigure 1. Experimental setup. Ten right-handed participants were asked to perform three real tool-use \nactions (i.e., pounding a nail with a hammer, sweeping sawdust with a brush, painting with a roller) by using \nfour different end-effectors in the following order: Right foot (customized snowboard fixation), right elbow \n(customized moldable plastic cast), left hand, and right hand. Here, only the hammer condition is shown.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScIentIfIc  REPORTs  |  (2018) 8:10429  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-28759-2\nDiscussion\nOur main finding is that participants kept the tools’ spatiotemporal parameters constant among the different \nend-effectors. For instance, when a participant used the hammer by executing a broader and faster movement \ncompared to other participants, these characteristics were maintained irrespective of the end-effector used  \n(see Fig. S1). This finding is at odds with the hand-centered motor program hypothesis, challenging the popular \nand widespread idea that the human brain stores specific tool-use motor programs that characterize the spatio-\ntemporal parameters of hand movements\n4–11.\nFigure 2. Spatiotemporal parameters of interest in function of tools and end-effectors. For each parameter, a \none-way MANOV A with Tool as within-subject factor was conducted on the values obtained for the four end-\neffectors. Significant differences were found for Vertical Amplitude, Cycle Duration, Peak Acceleration, and \nPeak Deceleration (all F(2,27) > 2.07, all p < 0.05), but not for Maximum Velocity (F(2,27) = 2.04, p = 0.06). \nWhen significant, post-hoc MANOV A were conducted for pairwise comparisons. Repeated-measure ANOV A \nwith End-Effector as within-subject factor were also computed to compare the four end-effectors for each tool \nand each parameter. When significant, post-hoc pairwise t-tests corrected with a Holm-Bonferroni procedure \nwere computed. Asterisks denote significant differences.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n4\nScIentIfIc  REPORTs  |  (2018) 8:10429  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-28759-2\nRather, our results provide support for the reasoning-based approach, which has been recently developed to \novercome some limitations of the manipulation-based approach16–20. The basic assumption is that tool use is based \non the ability to reason about physical object properties, by using mechanical knowledge. This technical reasoning \nis critical for forming a mental simulation of the tool-use action that constrains the motor actions appropriate to \nperform the intended tool-use action\n16–19. For instance, if a person aims to powerfully pound a nail, mechanical \nknowledge is useful to inform her that broad oscillation of the hammer is suitable. However, if the hammering \naction requires precision (e.g., stone knapping), smaller movements are needed\n21. Neuropsychological and neu-\nroimaging evidence indicates that technical reasoning skills may involve the left inferior parietal cortex 18,22–27 \n(particularly the cytoarchitectonic area PF), thus challenging the hypothesis proposed by the manipulation-based \napproach that this brain area is involved in the storage of hand-centered motor programs.\nThe important corollary is that we all have the neurocognitive potential to use different end-effectors to per-\nform a given tool-use action, inasmuch as the tool can be grasped and/or manipulated by the end-effector, what we \nterm poly-dexterity. Observations of tool use in individuals born without arms already suggest that a high poten-\ntial for “foot dexterity” can be reached in humans. As mentioned above, according to the manipulation-based \napproach, this phenomenon could result from extended practice and/or idiosyncratic neural plasticity based \non the ontogenetic recycling of hand-centered motor programs. Our findings speak against this hypothesis, by \nshowing that the ability to form a mental simulation of the intended tool-use action can allow people to guide the \ndifferent end-effectors in a coherent way\n28, even when using uncommon end-effectors for the very first time. As \nsuch, the differences between the end-effectors in terms of strength or velocity might be only a matter of biome-\nchanical constraint, but not of motor control per se.\nOur findings also support the idea that manual dexterity could have evolved because of the development of \nspecific tool use skills, but not the opposite. Specifically, the fact that people might be natural poly-dexters implies \nthat manual dexterity is not a prerequisite for tool use. Interestingly, the reciprocal is also true, as some left  \nbrain-damaged patients encounter severe difficulties when using tools properly even though they have no motor \ndeficit (e.g., motor apraxia\n19). To sum up, the discovery of poly-dexterity described here poses a great challenge to \ntheories that assume that the neurocognitive origins of human tool use lie in the development of specific manual \nskills.\nThe issue of motor equivalence is one of the most classical issues in the field of motor control\n29,30, largely \nexplored with the study of handwriting movements. Early reports indicated striking qualitative similarities of \nwriting traces between several end-effectors\n29–31, supporting the generalized motor program hypothesis32,33. This \nhypothesis was tested much later, and challenged, by quantitative kinematic analyses, which failed to provide \nobjective support for these similarities in handwriting movements\n34 or found such evidence only after consid-\nerable practice13. The present study is the first to address this issue in a context other than such a distinctive skill \nas handwriting, and our results clearly support the generalized – and not specific  – motor program hypothesis. \nAs it is obvious that handwriting is one outstandingly practiced tool-use action connected to complex language \nHammer Brush Roller\nVertical Amplitude\nR-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand R-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand R-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand\nR-Elbow 0.68 R-Elbow 0.49 R-Elbow 0.86\nL-Hand 0.63 0.88 L-Hand 0.43 0.93 L-Hand 0.76 0.98\nR-Hand 0.64 0.85 0.98 R-Hand 0.46 0.93 0.89 R-Hand 0.77 0.94 0.92\nCycle Duration\nR-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand R-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand R-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand\nR-Elbow 0.94 R-Elbow 0.89 R-Elbow 0.98\nL-Hand 0.91 0.99 L-Hand 0.94 0.98 L-Hand 0.99 0.98\nR-Hand 0.93 0.99 0.99 R-Hand 0.86 0.93 0.94 R-Hand 0.99 0.98 0.99\nMaximum Velocity \n(Forth Movement)\nR-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand R-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand R-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand\nR-Elbow 0.85 R-Elbow 0.70 R-Elbow 0.92\nL-Hand 0.93 0.83 L-Hand 0.82 0.92 L-Hand 0.84 0.94\nR-Hand 0.96 0.83 0.98 R-Hand 0.74 0.81 0.83 R-Hand 0.87 0.95 0.93\nPeak Acceleration \n(Forth Movement)\nR-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand R-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand R-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand\nR-Elbow 0.84 R-Elbow 0.64 R-Elbow 0.75\nL-Hand 0.82 0.96 L-Hand 0.57 0.75 L-Hand 0.65 0.94\nR-Hand 0.87 0.96 0.98 R-Hand 0.63 0.93 0.70 R-Hand 0.77 0.94 0.90\nPeak Deceleration \n(Forth Movement)\nR-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand R-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand R-Foot R-Elbow L-Hand\nR-Elbow 0.68 R-Elbow 0.62 R-Elbow 0.70\nL-Hand 0.86 0.78 L-Hand 0.96 0.75 L-Hand 0.84 0.82\nR-Hand 0.89 0.72 0.95 R-Hand 0.74 0.92 0.78 R-Hand 0.61 0.86 0.80\nTable 1.

Ten undergraduate students in cognitive sciences at the University of Lyon (M age = 23.4, \nSDage = 2.8; 5 females) took part in the experiment. All participants were right-handed (Edinburgh Score > 70) \nand had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. Participants had no previous history of neurological or psy-\nchiatric illnesses (i.e., motor, perceptual, cognitive or tool-use disorders). In addition, none of them had extensive \nexpertise with the tools chosen for the present experiment (i.e., no professional practice). All participants pro-\nvided written informed consent. The Ethics Committee of Department of Psychology of Lyon approved the study \nand the methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulation.\nMaterials and Procedure. Participants were instructed to actually perform three tool-use actions: \nPounding a nail with a hammer, sweeping sawdust with a brush, and painting with a roller. We chose these three \ntool-use actions for the following reasons: (1) To be representative of what is studied in the literature, tool-use \nactions had to be commonly found in tool-use studies on the topic\n22,35,36; (2) To increase the feasibility of the \nexperiment, tool-use actions had to require large movements; (3) To potentially generalize our results to different \ntools, we chose to investigate the kinematic parameters of three tool-use actions, and not only of one tool-use \nFigure 3. Correlations between the end-effectors for maximum velocity and cycle duration (Hammer \ncondition). Bars represent individual standard errors. The four end-effectors are: Right foot, right elbow, left \nhand and right hand. Correlations are Pearson’s correlation coefficients. They all are significant (see Table 1).\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n6\nScIentIfIc  REPORTs  |  (2018) 8:10429  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-28759-2\naction as reported in previous studies on the topic 14,15,37; (4) To potentially generalize our results to the three \ndimensional axes, each tool-use action had to be performed preferentially on one of the three axes (i.e. Hammer: \nVertical axis; Brush: Lateral axis; Roller: Anteroposterior axis).\nThe actions had to be carried out with four different end-effectors in the following order: Right foot, right \nelbow, left hand and right hand. As expected, all participants stated that they never used these types of tools \notherwise than with the right hand. No specific instruction was given with regard to how to do the action. For \ninstance, for the hammer, no information was offered about the strength to apply. For each tool, participants had \nto perform the action with the four end-effectors consecutively, and then another tool was proposed. The order \nof presentation of tools was counterbalanced between the participants. Participants were told to repeat the action \nuntil the experimenter stopped them. They were stopped after 20 to 25 cycles, so that we could obtain 14 cycles \ncorresponding to the cycles 6–19 (i.e., the first five cycles were systematically removed). A cycle corresponded to \nthe total distance travelled by the tool including the forth movement (i.e., for the hammer, the movement from \nthe up position to the nail) and the back movement (i.e., the movement from the nail to the up position).\nIn all conditions, participants were seated on a chair in front of an adjustable custom table. For the foot con-\ndition, the tool was attached under a snowboard binding. For the elbow condition, the tool was attached under \na plaster cast requiring to fold the elbow around 90°. For the left hand and the right hand conditions, the tool \nwas grasped by the handle. To make the different end-effector conditions comparable, the handle separating the \nend-effector (i.e., the base of the thumb, the extremity of the elbow and the extremity of the toes) from the active \npart of the tool (e.g., the head of the hammer) was made identical for all tools. The table used was one-meter \nsquare and 75–90-cm high for the elbow and hands condition. This height was adjusted for each participant in \norder to make the execution of the action comfortable. For the foot condition, this table was about 10-cm high. \nFor the hammering action, a wooden nail (10-cm length; 2-cm diameter) was placed at the center of the table. \nThe task was to pound it with a wooden hammer. For the brushing action, the tabletop had a 40-cm strip made \nof glued sawdust. This strip was in a lateral orientation with respect to the participant’s body. For this action, the \nsawdust should be swept from the right to the left. For the painting action, the tabletop was divided into three \nstrips, two lateral blue 30-cm strips and one central non-colored 40-cm strip. They were in an antero-posterior \norientation with respect to the participant’s body. The task was to paint the non-colored strip. Performance of \nthe hammering action was assessed, by measuring the depth to which the nail was driven. We could not use any \nindicator to specify the performance for the brush and roller conditions, but all participants performed these \nactions effectively.\nMotion capture. Tools’ motion was recorded using an eight cameras optoelectronic motion capture system \n(Motion Analysis, 200  Hz). Six passive markers attached to each tool were recorded continuously during each \ntool-use action. Computed trajectories were filtered using a Butterworth low pas filter at 10 Hz cut-off frequency.\nData analysis. The x−, y−, and z-axes corresponded to the anteroposterior, lateral and vertical directions \nwith respect to the participant’s body. The spatial attribute of tool motion was quantified by the vertical amplitude. \nFor the brush and the roller, the lateral and the anteroposterior amplitudes could have been chosen, respectively. \nHowever, we did not do so, because the bounds of the table constrained the lateral and the anteroposterior ampli-\ntude of movements in all participants, considerably reducing inter-individual variability. The vertical amplitude \nwas nevertheless a good indicator to specify the movements for these two tools. The kinematic features were \nspecified by the cycle duration, the maximum velocity, the peak acceleration, and the peak deceleration. For the \nthree latter features, we focused our analyses on the forth movement because it better characterizes the tool-use \naction performed than the back movement.\nReferences\n 1. Marzke, M.
