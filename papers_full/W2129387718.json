INTRODUCTION\nThe increasing demand for higher transport capacity in\nDWDM core networks can be fulﬁlled with di ﬀerent com-\nplementary approaches: by increasing the number of chan-\nnels, increasing the transported bit rate per channel or de-\ncreasing the channel spacing. The later two approaches lead\nto an augment of the spectral e ﬃciency of the DWDM net-\nwork. As the spectral e ﬃciency increases, the crosstalk be-\ntween the DWDM channels arises as important transmis-\nsion and also node functionality impairment. Next genera-\ntion DWDM networks operating at ultrahigh bit rates, that\nis, 160 Gbps per channel, require precise channel transmis-\nsion quality assessment systems inside the network infras-\ntructure. For this reason ﬁbre link condition and optical node\nfunctionalities have to be carefully monitored in order to en-\nable ultracapacity (greater than 10 Tbps) all-optical DWDM\nnetworks [1].\nFrom the network node point of view, second-generation\nall-optical nodes are especially susceptible to crosstalk [ 2, 3]\nwhich is accumulated at each node along the optical path\n[4]. Crosstalk in the optical node can be classiﬁed as ei-\nther heterodyne (crosstalk between signals at di ﬀerent wave-\nlengths) or homodyne (crosstalk between signals at the same\nnominal wavelength, also known as in-band crosstalk). Ho-\nmodyne crosstalk can be further subdivided into homo-\ndyne coherent crosstalk, if it is produced between phase-\ncorrelated signals, and homodyne incoherent crosstalk, if\nproduced between signals which are not phase-correlated\n[3]. The most important noise contribution in the optical\nnode is the homodyne noncoherent crosstalk [ 3, 4]. This\nnoise is originated inside the network node due to nonper-\nfect blocking of channels at the same nominal wavelength\nduring channel extraction, multiplex, demultiplex, or chan-\nnel wavelength conversion operations. This crosstalk is in-\ncoherent, since it is originated by a di ﬀerent channel and\n1594 EURASIP Journal on Applied Signal Processing\ncannot be eliminated once generated. This incoherent homo-\ndyne crosstalk exhibits the same spectral power distribution\npresent in any DWDM channel in the system and has to be\nproperly monitored in order to guarantee node operation.\nRegarding the possible presence of additional homodyne in-\ntrachannel coherent crosstalk (originated by channel power\nleaking and propagation by di ﬀerent paths inside the opti-\ncal node), it does not possess a real problem since the dif-\nference between the light paths inside the network node is\nusually longer than the coherence length of the laser source\n[4].\nIn the DWDM network the optical nodes are connected\nby optical transmission links. In order to reach maximum\ntransport capacity, it is necessary to combine tight chan-\nnel spacing and compact-spectrum modulations [ 5]. The\nlink capacity limiting factor is the optical bandwidth of\nthe transmission ampliﬁers. Commercially available erbium\ndoped ﬁbre ampliﬁers (EDFA) allow a usable bandwidth of\n30–40 nm. To achieve bandwidths larger than 80 nm, novel\nampliﬁer architectures based on hybrid Raman ampliﬁca-\ntion/erbium, tellurite doping, or hybrid Raman ampliﬁca-\ntion/tellurite have been proposed [ 6] but these technolo-\ngies are not readily available. Ultra-high-capacity DWDM\nnetworks require to ﬁt the maximum number of chan-\nnels in the ampliﬁer bandwidth, which in turn require\nthe use of spectrally e ﬃcient modulations like single side-\nband (SSB), vestigial sideband (VSB), nonreturn to zero\n(NRZ) or optical duobinary, or compact-spectrum modu-\nlation like carrier-suppressed return to zero (CS-RZ), alter-\nnate polarization RZ (AP-RZ) or alternate chirp RZ (AC-\nRZ), and/or polarization interleaving between the di ﬀerent\nWDM channels [ 5, 7]. Under these circumstances (close\npackaging of the WDM channels and compact spectrum\nof the DWDM channels) crosstalk monitoring is a key ele-\nment for the optical link reliability as transmitter, or optical\npath degradation will impact the link availability very quickly\n[1].\nCrosstalk in the optical link arises from di ﬀerent sources:\nlinear crosstalk between adjacent DWDM channels due to in-\nsuﬃcient channel spacing, nonlinear crosstalk arising from\nthe wavelength interaction due to the ﬁbre nonlinearities,\nand also intrachannel time crosstalk produced by the pulse\nbroadening when pulses propagate along the dispersion map\nof the transmission link. Linear crosstalk is important as\nthe degradation of network equipment, channel central fre-\nquency shift due to temperature drift in DFB-LD lasers, or\ndegradation in optoelectronic transmitters will strongly im-\npact the performance if tight channel spacing is used [ 7].\nNonlinear crosstalk is produced in the DWDM link from\nnonlinear e ﬀects mainly four-wave mixing (FWM) between\ndiﬀerent channels [ 8]. This e ﬀect although mitigated by the\ndispersion map is enhanced when the channel separation is\nvery tight and nonuniform channel spacing can not be used\n[8, 9].\nIn the case of intrachannel crosstalk, this noise is due\nto cross-phase modulation (XPM) and four-wave mixing in\nthe time domain. Time-domain FWM is reﬂected in ampli-\ntude ﬂuctuation as reported in [ 10]. In dispersion-managed\ntransmission links with small average dispersion this noise\nincreases with distance and its mitigation requires the use\nof loss compensation by means of Raman ampliﬁcation. In\nthe case of intrachannel XPM this is reﬂected in a mean fre-\nquency shift of the pulses which is translated to timing jit-\nter through ﬁbre dispersion [ 11]. If negligible average dis-\npersion is achieved along the transmission link, this e ﬀect is\nsuppressed [11, 12]. This is the particular case of ultracapac-\nity DWDM networks. Transmission at 160 Gbps channel bit\nrate requires that the optical link between nodes be carefully\nplanned in advance as pointed out in the small number of\ntrials performed over actual SSMF [ 13]. The dispersion map\nused requires extremely low residual dispersion (1.2 ps/nm\nmax. deviation for 160 km SSMF transmission) and also dis-\npersion slope compensation [ 14]. It is also worth noting that\nthe complete chromatic dispersion compensation along the\nsystem makes the accumulated chirp in the pulses negligible\n[12].\nCommon channel monitoring techniques rely on the use\nof arrayed-wavelength gratings (AWG) [ 15], Fabry-Perot ﬁl-\nters [16], acousto-optic tunable ﬁlters [ 17], or tunable active\nﬁlters [ 18] in order to separate the di ﬀerent WDM channels\nand to evaluate the channel noise power in absence of trans-\nmitted power, that is, stopping the channel operation. Other\nnondisruptive techniques propose the use of pilot sideband\ntones besides the digital data spectrum in order to evalu-\nate the degradation of the transmitted information for each\nwavelength [ 19]. This method lacks transparency through\nthe optical network nodes, like optical add-drop multiplex-\ners (OADM) and optical cross-connects (OXC), as the pi-\nlot tones are eliminated after regeneration inside the net-\nwork element. Another technique proposes the use of low-\nspeed modulated signals overimposed on the main bit stream\n[20]. This technique requires the use of speciﬁc modula-\ntion and demodulation systems which can increase system\ncomplexity.\nOur target is to monitor the crosstalk level in the DWDM\nnetwork node either if it is originated inside the node or in\nthe transmission link. The herein proposed system is based\non optically time gating the DWDM signal during a spe-\nciﬁc time duration (one-bit time-slot) and to perform a\ncontinuous optical Fourier transform (OFT) comprising the\nwhole set of transmitted wavelengths. This approach does\nnot require to stop the channel operation. Once the spec-\ntral information has been brought to time domain, the ba-\nsic parameters such as amplitude (channel power) or central\nwavelength can be evaluated. The key advantage of the pro-\nposed technique is that, additionally, it is feasible to evalu-\nate the crosstalk spectral distribution (the interfering optical\npower distribution with frequency) that any DWDM chan-\nn e li ss u ﬀering. This is accomplished by the real-time OFT\noperation. Once the spectral data is in the time domain, it\nis photodetected and sampled to be postprocessed. In pres-\nence of crosstalk, the samples captured exhibit a uniformly\ndistributed noise at speciﬁc time positions. By measuring\nthe noise power and the noise time position we can eval-\nuate the crosstalk level and the crosstalk spectral location,\nrespectively.\nCrosstalk Evaluation Using Optical Fourier Transformers 1595\nThe crosstalk spectral distribution gives us more infor-\nmation than the total crosstalk ﬁgure in dB usually given in\ncrosstalk measurements. The knowledge of the spectral dis-\ntribution opens up the opportunity to identify the crosstalk\nsource, that is, if it comes (in the case of linear crosstalk)\nfrom the channel at the right or at the left. It is clear that\nif the crosstalk source is an adjacent channel, its spectral\ndistribution will be at one side of the channel spectrum. If\nit is originated by nonlinear crosstalk due to FWM (evenly\nspaced channels), then the noise spectral maximum will be\nat the central frequency of the crosstalked channel. In this\ncase, once the crosstalk type is identiﬁed, we can correlate the\npresence of crosstalk in a speciﬁc channel with the presence\nof power in a given set of channels. This correlation allows us\nto identify the crosstalk origin channels.\nAs discussed before, the OFT is the key operation of the\nproposed system and it is performed over the whole optical\nsystem bandwidth. The OFT operation is implemented here\nby means of a dispersive element. The use of chromatic dis-\npersion e ﬀect in standard single-mode ﬁbre (SSMF) to con-\nvert the spectral information to time domain has been previ-\no u s l yr e p o r t e di n[21, 22]. Linearly chirped ﬁbre Bragg grat-\nings (LCFBG) have been also proposed as dispersive elements\ncapable of performing this operation [ 23]. The Fourier trans-\nformers using SSMFs give the advantage of nearly no band-\nwidth limitation, which makes this approach especially in-\nteresting for large-channel-count DWDM systems. The use\nof dispersive devices in real-time spectrum analysis systems\nwas proposed for DWDM systems in [ 21] and experimentally\ndemonstrated for a phase coherent spectrum [ 24] (coherency\nmeans here that all the lights present at the spectrum have the\nsame phase reference, i.e., the whole spectrum comes from\nonly one optical source). Actual DWDM systems, however,\nexhibit lack of phase coherency between the di ﬀerent WDM\nchannels as they come from di ﬀerent optical sources. This\nlack of spectral coherency leads to the presence of an ampli-\ntude noise after the OFT that depends on the crosstalk level.\nThe amplitude noise power level gives us information about\nthe crosstalk level that the channel under evaluation is su ﬀer-\ning from the rest of the WDM channels. This correspondence\nwill be evaluated in the next section.\nAnother interesting feature of the proposed OFT ap-\nproach is the time expansion e ﬀect introduced by the dis-\npersive element. In the proposed system, the output from the\nOFT cell is a time-stretched version of the Fourier transform\nof the input signal envelope. This expansion in time is a con-\nvenient feature as it is possible to use commercially available\nelectrical analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) circuitry in or-\nder to capture (convert the electrical photodetected signal to\ndigital data) the spectrum and to postprocess the results.\n2. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION\nWe consider a generic crosstalk situation in a DWDM net-\nwork employing Gaussian RZ modulation. The network uses\nK channels (wavelengths) with channel spacing ∆ (rad/s). In\nconventional DWDM networks the channel separation ∆ is\nwide enough so that the spectral overlap between the chan-\nnels is negligible. This is not the case of high-spectral e ﬃ-\nciency networks where the adjacent channel power can leak\ndue to not perfect channel ﬁltering at multiplexing stage,\nduring channel extraction operation or because of transmit-\nter degradation.\nIn the general case, for the sake of simplicity we will con-\nsider that the DWDM channels are evenly spaced around\na central angular frequency ω0 so the central angular fre-\nquency for the kth channel is ω0 + ωk = ω0 + ∆ ·k,w h e r e\nk =−(K −1)/2 ··· (K −1)/2. This DWDM spectral space\ncan be described by equation ( 1), where sA(t) is the bit-\nsynchronised received optical complex ﬁeld envelope around\nthe central angular frequency of the DWDM transmission\nsystem ( ω0). The channels are considered synchronised in\ntime as this is the worst-case crosstalk scenario. In equation\n(1) Ak stands for the optical ﬁeld amplitude and bk,n is the\ntransmitted data (mark or space) by the channel kin the nth-\nbit time-slot. The parameter Tk stands for the Gaussian pulse\nhalf-width at 1 /e fall from peak. R = 1/Tb is the system bit\nrate. Figure 1 shows the DWDM system in a bidimensional\nspace (angular frequency, time) described by\nsA(t) =\n∑\nk\n∑\nn\nAkbn,k exp\n(\njωkt\n)\nexp\n[\n−1\n2\n( t−nTb\nTk\n)2]\n. (1)\nOur analysis targets crosstalk evaluation in a generic network\nnode. Such node, optical add-drop multiplexer (OADM) or\noptical cross-connect (OXC), is depicted in Figure 2 (top\ndiagram). This generic node can perform DWDM inser-\ntion/extraction or wavelength conversion whether it is an\nOADM (optical add-drop multiplexer) or an OXC (optical\ncross-connect). The channel monitoring block is shown be-\nfore the node operation, controlling a channel equalizer and\nmonitoring the crosstalk introduced in the link. This block\ncan be placed inside the node or directly in the transmission\nlink sending information through a supervisory channel.\nThe proposed DWDM crosstalk monitoring system ar-\nchitecture is shown in Figure 2 (bottom schematic). The sys-\ntem consists of a gating switch which selects only one bit pe-\nriod ( Tb time duration) of every N bits. This gating switch\ncan be implemented in the optical domain by using saturable\nabsorbers [ 25, 26], interferometric devices like the nonlin-\near optical loop mirror (NOLM) [ 27] and the ultrafast non-\nlinear interferometer (UNI) [ 28], or a Mach-Zender archi-\ntecture employing semiconductor optical ampliﬁers (SOA)\n[28]. These devices can work at 160 Gbps core network line\nrates. The purpose of the gating switch is to select only one\nbit-slot of every N bits (one bit-slot contains only one bit\nfrom all the wavelengths of the DWDM system as the opti-\ncal gate does not impose any bandwidth limitation) and to\nfeed it into the OFT cell which performs an optical Fourier\ntransform. The exact value of N depends on the chromatic\ndispersion of the OFT cell as will be discussed later. This gat-\ning can be performed in a continuous basis or every time\nthat a channel monitoring is desired.

As mentioned before, at the output of\nthe OFT cell, the spectral information is obtained as a time\nsignal. Therefore, we have performed the spectrum-to-time\nconversion of one time-slot comprising the whole set of\nK wavelengths of the DWDM system.

The pulses amplitudes involve the factor L\nstanding for the OFT device optical losses. This signal is\nthen photodetected and converted from electrical continu-\nous signal to digital data in order to evaluate the spectrum.\nThis conversion can be performed by a commercial ADC:\nsC,n(t) =L·exp\n(\n−jt2\n2 ¨Φ\n){\nFT\n[\nsB(t)\n]}\nω=t/ ¨Φ\n=L·exp\n(\n−jt2\n2 ¨Φ\n)\nSB\n( t\n¨Φ\n)\n=L·exp\n(\n−jt2\n2 ¨Φ\n)\n×\n∑\nk\nAkbn,kTk\n√\n2πexp\n{\n−1\n2\n[(\nt−k·∆ · ¨Φ\n)2T2\nk\n¨Φ2\n]}\n.\n(3)\nFrom ( 3), if the dispersive element presents a ﬁrst-order\ndispersion coe ﬃcient of ¨Φ =− ∂2Φ/∂ω2, the resulting time\nsignal after OFT comprises Gaussian shape pulses (as cor-\nresponds to the Fourier transform of a Gaussian pulse) of\nwidth ¨Φ/Tk separated in time by the factor ∆ · ¨Φ.E a c h\nchannel spectrum outputs from the OFT cell with k ·∆ ·\n¨Φ separation.

After\nOFT, photodetection, and sampling, given the spectrum in-\nformation, we can evaluate the channel amplitude (power)\nlevel, the channel separation (time di ﬀerence between power\npeaks), and the crosstalk the channel is su ﬀering, as will be\ndiscussed later. By example, the use of a commercial ADC\nwith a sampling rate of 800 Msps (readily available from\ndiﬀerent vendors) leads to 1.25 nanosecond temporal res-\nolution. The accumulated dispersion from 150 km SSMF\n(−19 296 ps/THz) OFT gives a spectral resolution (frequency\nseparation between samples) as low as 64 GHz. To achieve a\nﬁne sampling of the spectrum envelope, the proposed sys-\ntem includes an optical delay line (ODL) shown in Figure 2\nwhich delays the input to the ADC in a computer-controlled\nway. Sweeping the optical delay, the di ﬀerent points of the\nDWDM spectrum will be sampled and we can reconstruct\nits shape completely. The sampled waveform corresponds to\na spectral-domain to time-domain conversion taking place,\nand the power overlapping in the spectrum will appear as\nan amplitude noise in the Gaussian pulses after Fourier\ntransform.\n1598 EURASIP Journal on Applied Signal Processing\nIn order to characterize the noise in the time domain,\nwe will evaluate now the output from the OFT when two\ngeneric wavelengths with ∆ channel separation overlap to\nsome extent in spectrum: we consider two adjacent DWDM\nchannels, k and k + 1, bearing Gaussian RZ pulses in the\nDWDM system of amplitude Ak and Ak+1 and pulse width\nTk and Tk+1, respectively. This is a general case from equa-\ntion ( 2) where the interaction of any two channels is evalu-\nated. This generic situation can be particularized for di ﬀerent\nkinds of crosstalk described in the previous section. For lin-\near crosstalk, the noise origin is the spectrum overlap from\nthe adjacent channel, the spectral separation between lights\nof channel k and k+ 1 is the channel spacing ∆ ≫ 0, and the\namplitudes Ak and Ak+1 will be in the same order of mag-\nnitude, Ak ≈ Ak+1. In the case of nonlinear crosstalk, the\nnoise origin is another channel which, due to nonlinear ef-\nfect like FWM, appears spectrally overimposed (the channels\nare equally spaced) exactly at the centre of the channel under\nstudy k. In this case the spectral separation between channel\nk and the interference k + 1 is negligible ∆ ≈ 0, but due to\nlimited FWM e ﬃciency, the interference amplitude will be\nmuch lower Ak+1 ≪ Ak.\nFollowing the general analysis, the channels k and k +1\ncome from di ﬀerent optical sources through di ﬀerent opti-\ncal paths. As these channels are mutually noncoherent, the\noptical phase di ﬀerence is considered by the term φ which\nis a uniformly distributed random variable.

The photodetected signal at the\nOFT output is proportional to the optical intensity Iout(t)a s\ndescribed by ( 6). This intensity corresponds to the combina-\ntion of the wavelengths k and k+ 1 power spectra with noise\nIout ∼\n⏐⏐Sk(ω)+ Sk+1(ω)e x p (jφ)\n⏐⏐2\nω=t/ ¨Φ\n=S2\nk\n(\nt\n¨Φ\n)\n+ S2\nk+1\n(\nt\n¨Φ\n)\n+ n(t).\n(6)\nThe noise n(t) involves the random variable φ which is the\nphase diﬀerence between both wavelengths at any time posi-\ntion. Except for if both lights are provided by the same opti-\ncal source and are guided through the same optical path, we\ncan only say that φ adopts a random value between −π and\nπ with uniform distribution. This noise is a random process\nand is described by equation ( 7). Every time a channel esti-\nmation is done, we obtain one realization of the process. For\nsimplicity, the realization number is not shown in\nn(t) =2Sk\n(\nt\n¨Φ\n)\nSk+1\n(\nt\n¨Φ\n)\ncos(φ). (7)\nFrom ( 7) the OFT output at any speciﬁc time position ti,\nthat is, n(ti), is a random variable. This random variable will\nﬂuctuate according to the random nature of the phase dif-\nference φ. The noise variance (ﬂuctuation) for time position\nis given by ( 8) and shows that the noise power in time do-\nmain follows (except by a proportionality factor) the optical\nspectrum overlap Sk(ti/¨Φ)Sk+1(ti/¨Φ):\nσ2\nn,ti =4πS2\nk\n(\nti\n¨Φ\n)\nS2\nk+1\n(\nti\n¨Φ\n)\n. (8)\nEquation (8) reﬂects that the noise power at the speciﬁc time\nposition ti depends only on the crosstalk at the speciﬁc spec-\ntrum angular frequency ω0 +ti/¨Φ. Sweeping the time position\nti, we sweep over the complete spectral range. In this way, ac-\ncumulating the samples for any time position ti, we can eval-\nuate its mean and variance for the corresponding frequency.\nThe variance represents the crosstalk noise as this is produced\nby the crosstalk (if no crosstalk is present, no variance can be\nobserved) as is discussed in the next section. In this way we\ncan calculate the crosstalk spectral distribution. This result is\ndiﬃcult to achieve with current spectrum analysis techniques\nand is enabled by the feasible real-time Fourier Transform\no p e r a t i o np r o p o s e di n[21].\nThe crosstalk spectral distribution gives us total\ncrosstalking power (noise integrated over the channel under\nstudy bandwidth) and, from the envelope of the noise\nspectral distribution, we can identify the crosstalk nature:\nif it is located at one side of the channel bandwidth, then\nthe origin is linear crosstalk from the adjacent channel as is\ndemonstrated in the experimental work in the next section.\nIf the noise distribution is centered in the channel bandwidth\nunder study and follows the Gaussian power proﬁle, then the\nCrosstalk Evaluation Using Optical Fourier Transformers 1599\nsource is nonlinear FWM (provided the channels are equally\nspaced). In this case, performing a statistical correlation of\nthis noise with the presence of power (marks) transmitted\nin any other DWDM channel, we can identify the crosstalk\nsource.\nThis result can be extended to more than two interfering\nchannels: we evaluate now the inﬂuence of multiple channels\ninterfering a given channel k. Noncoherent crosstalk, which\nmeans that the interfering channels are uncorrelated, will be\nreﬂected again as the power spectrum overlap. In the case of\nM interferers over the kth channel, the noise from any chan-\nnel of the system will also be additive in power. Equation\n(9) is an generalization of equation ( 8) for the interaction\nof channel mover channel k:\nσ2\nk,m,ti =4πS2\nk\n(\nti\n¨Φ\n)\nS2\nm\n(\nti\n¨Φ\n)\n. (9)\nThe total noise power, if M channels a ﬀect, will be given by\n(10), as the di ﬀerent n2\nk,m(t)f o re a c h m interfering channel\nare uncorrelated noise processes for each m channel as the\nchannels are not mutually coherent:\nσ2\nk,M,ti =\n∑\nM\nσ2\nk,m,ti =S2\nk\n(\nti\n¨Φ\n) ∑\nM\nS2\nm\n(\nti\n¨Φ\n)\n. (10)\nEquation ( 10) reﬂects that the total crosstalk noise spectral\nproﬁle is the sum of the spectrum envelope overlaps of all\nchannels m ̸=k. In the case of channels with large frequency\nseparation, its inﬂuence will be quickly dismissed, as the\nGaussian spectral shape decays quickly. In the case of non-\nlinear crosstalk, as mentioned at the beginning of the section,\nthe channel separation is almost zero, but due to the low non-\nlinear process e ﬃciency the interference amplitude Am will\nbe much lower than the channel under study Ak.T h ep a r -\nticular FWM e ﬃciency value depends on the particular dis-\npersion and ampliﬁcation map [ 9] of the system, and will be\nreﬂected in the Am amplitude implicit in the term S2m(ti/¨Φ)\nin (10).\n3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAs a proof of concept, a set-up has been arranged to eval-\nuate the proposed monitoring technique operation on two\nDWDM channels transporting Gaussian RZ pulses with\nstrong linear crosstalk following the calculations in the previ-\nous section. This linear crosstalk is induced arranging the dif-\nferent channels with enough frequency overlap. If we would\nconsider in-band crosstalk, we would simply overlap the\nwavelengths completely. The set-up is shown in Figure 4 and\nconsists of two tunable mode-locked laser sources with a\nwavelength range of + /−12 nm around 1552 nm. The gener-\nated pulses are mutually noncoherent and exhibit TFWHM =\n1.6 picoseconds. This pulse width corresponds to 25% RZ\nsignaling at 160 Gbps bit rate per channel. The repetition\nrate is set to R = 1.04150 GHz using an external RF refer-\nence signal. A RF phase shifter was employed for ﬁne tun-\ning in order to vary the relative pulse positions. An optical\ndelay line for coarse tuning may be also used, as shown in\nFigure 4. After combining both pulsed lights, the signal is\npassed through a dispersive device (OFT cell). In the exper-\niment a coil of 2.1 km of SSMF was used, providing a total\ndispersion of ¨Φ =−42.855 ps2/rad, which is large enough to\nperform a successful Fourier transform, as it meets the con-\ndition |T2\nb/¨Φ|≪ 1r e p o r t e di n[23]. The large optical band-\nwidth of the ﬁbre-based OFT cell presents the advantage of\nbeing wide enough to allocate the whole system bandwidth.\nThis would be di ﬃcult to accomplish if a linearly chirped ﬁ-\nbre Bragg grating was used for FT operation in a large WDM\nsystem, as the system bandwidth might exceed the grating\nbandwidth. Furthermore, the signal is photo-detected and\nmonitored in the sampling scope.\nFigure 5a shows the spectrum of two DWDM channels\nfrom the experimental set-up described above with channel\nspacing of 3.72 nm, whereas Figure 5b shows the output of\nthe OFT cell after photodetection (electrical output). We can\nobserve the good agreement between the optical spectrum\nat the input and the time electrical waveforms shape at the\noutput, hence demonstrating the proper FT operation.\nIn order to evaluate the ﬁbre-based Fourier transformer\nbehavior in the presence of linear crosstalk, a strong wave-\nlength overlap is introduced by getting closer (spectral spac-\ning of 2.3976 nm) the DWDM wavelengths. Figure 5c shows\nthe spectrum in this situation, whereas Figure 5d shows the\noutput from the OFT cell. The presence of the predicted am-\nplitude noise dependent on the linear crosstalk at the input\nis clearly shown as was expected from ( 7). If no crosstalk is\npresent (e.g., Ak =0) all the amplitude noise vanishes as can\nbe seen in the insets (e) and (f) in Figure 5.\nThis amplitude noise (marked with the rectangle in\nFigure 5) is present only at the time positions where there\nwas spectrum overlap in the frequency domain. In order\nto assess this correspondence, we have evaluated the accu-\nmulated noise after several successive OFT (channel evalua-\ntion) operations. Figure 6 shows the optical power spectrum\noverlap 4πS2\nk(ω)S2\nk+1(ω) over the electrical amplitude noise at\nOFT output σ2n,t. The correspondence of the spectrum over-\nlap with the amplitude noise rms (noise power distribution\nover time) value shows good agreement, thus validating ( 8).\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nA novel channel monitoring technique for high-speed\nDWDM networks based on performing the Fourier trans-\nform with a simple dispersive element has been proposed and\nvalidated. Gaussian 1.6-picosecond pulses, typical in 25% RZ\n160 Gbps transmission, have been used for demonstration\npurposes. Proper OFT cell operation has been demonstrated\nusing 2.1 km of SSMF. Amplitude noise correspondence, af-\nter OFT operation and photodetection, with the optical spec-\ntral overlap (linear crosstalk) proﬁle has been evaluated and\nexperimentally validated.\n1600 EURASIP Journal on Applied Signal Processing\n1.041 GHz\nRF Ref\nλ1 =1555.2n m\nMode-\nlocked laser\n(1)\nPhase\nshifter\nbn,0\nλ2 =1556.77 nm\nMode-\nlocked laser\n(2)\nbn,1\nODL\nGaussian\n1.6 ps FWHM λk\nOptical\ncombiner OFT\n2.1k mS S M F P D4 0G H z\nΣ\nSync\nλk+1\n(4)\nOSA\n(5) Sampling\nscope\nFigure 4: Experimental set-up.
