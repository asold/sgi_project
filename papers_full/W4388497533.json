Introduction \nIn the confluence of art and technology, the burgeoning potential of extended reality (XR), including \naugmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and virtual reality (VR), melding with large language models \n(LLMs) to represent cultural heritage within the metaverse is clearly evident[1,2]. From November 2022 onward, \na remarkable transformation has been observed in the realm of generative artificial intelligence (AI) [3] and \nlarge language models (LLMs), with novel opportunities being unveiled and stimulating debates initiated about \nthe forthcoming direction of AI. AI constructs such as OpenAI ’s ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 have demonstrated an \nimpressive capacity to produce textual content that echoes human language, while simultaneously m anaging \nintricate conversational engagements[4]. As progress in the domain continues, the possible implementations of \nARTICLE INFO \nReceived: 9 August 2023 | Accepted: 21 September 2023 | Available online: 8 November 2023 \nCITATION \nHutson J, Ratican J.

Though machine intelligence (ML) and \nhuman emotions remain inherently different, the capacity of LLMs to simulate and assume different \n“personalities” has shown promising avenues for exploration into artificial emotional aspects [3]. This \nadvancement sets the stage for the development of AI systems that are proficient in comprehending and \ngenerating appropriate emotional reactions, thereby enhancing user interaction and fostering more profound \nengagements[9]. As well, such an amalgamation has led scholars and technologists to contemplate the creation \nof digital homunculi, or changelings: virtual entities endowed with distinct consciousness, yet embedded \nwithin a collective cognitive fabric [10]. Such entities challenge pre -existing conc eptions of individuality, \nconsciousness, and the very essence of self-awareness[11]. \nHistorically, the interplay between technology and art has engendered novel paradigms and vistas for \nrepresentation and interaction [12]. As the boundaries of technological capabilities expand, so too does the \nhorizon for artistic and cultural exploration. Within this expansive framework emerges the concept of digital \nhomunculi. Drawing from historical, literary, and cinematic contexts, the term “changeling” alludes to beings \ncapable of transformation or substitution —an apt metaphor for entities that oscillate between individual and \ncollective consciousness. A profound intrigue accompanies the juxtaposition of individual consciousness with \nthe notion of a shared cognitive realm. One might draw parallels to the exploration of outer space: just as the \nvastness of the cosmos prompts humanity to grapple with its place within it, the vastness of collective digital \nconsciousness forces an introspection of the self’s position in relation to the collective[13]. \nLLMs present a promising frontier in the realm of cultural heritage experiences, opening pathways to \nengage users with history and culture in nuanced and dynamic ways. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs can \nfoster individualized and collective explorations, providing a spectrum of experiences ranging from intimate \ndialogues with historically significant figures to broad, immersive interactions within ancient cities or \ncivilizations. The intricate design of these models enables the simulation of diverse consciousness types and \npersonalities, closely aligned with historical and cultural contexts, thereby enriching educational and \nrecreational endeavors. This paper embarks on a systematic  investigation into the evolution of simulated \nconsciousness and personality through AI, focusing on its applicability to the multifaceted world of cultural \nheritage experiences. Through a blend of theoretical analysis and practical insights, the explorati on aims to \nunravel the potential of LLMs to create bridges between the past and present, offering a vivid, accessible, and \nauthentic journey through the tapestry of human history. \n2. Literature review \nThe burgeoning field of technological advancement presents a multifaceted landscape, warranting an in-\ndepth examination of its various components and their intersections with society. The following seeks to \nexplore three seminal dimensions of contemporary technology that have manifested profound implications \nacross diverse domains. The first section delves into the evolution and application of immersive realities in the \npreservation, interpretation, and dissemination of cultural heritage. It elucidates the manner in which these \ntechnologies have revolutionized the way societies engage with their historical and cultural legacies. The \nsubsequent section offers an analysis of the ascendance of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically focusing on \nlarge language models. These computational systems have ushered in a new era of human-computer interaction, \ntransforming communication, information retrieval, and decision-making processes. The final section embarks \non a philosophical exploration of digital entities and their impact on human consciousness and probes the \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n3 \nemergent phenomena of digital representations of self and the collective, examining how these virtual \nconstructs shape human understanding, identity, and social dynamics. Collectively, these interrelated facets \npresent a compelling tapestry of technological innovation, bridging the traditional and the novel, the material \nand the virtual, the individual and the communal. \n2.1. Immersive technologies in cultural heritage \nHistorically, XR technologies have been lauded for their potential in enhancing user experiences in \nvarious fields, from gaming to education. The application of immersive realities, including virtual reality (VR), \nwithin the context of cultural heritage ha s marked a transformative era for the preservation and accessibility \nof historical sites and artifacts. This evolution began around 2001, with the digitization of cultural heritage \nsites, both extant and ancient, although initial use was largely confined t o researchers with specialized \nknowledge. Techniques such as CA VE technology allowed institutions such as the Foundation of the Hellenic \nWorld (FHW) to digitally reconstruct ancient cities, exemplified by the rendering of Miletus, a historically \nsignificant settlement in Asia Minor [14]. The promise of this technology for museums was readily \nacknowledged; Roussou [15])expounded upon the potential for enhancing physical exhibits with digital \ncomponents for an “edutainment” experience, merging education and entertainment. \nBetween 2001 and 2010, various museums, including The Museum of Pure Form and The Virtual \nMuseum of Sculpture, integrated immersive realities into their spaces. Unlike applications in medical or \nscientific fields that required substantial training, these virtual exhibits were constructed for the lay public with \nminimal experience operating complex hardware. Drawing on earlier works by Salzman, Dede, Loftin, and \nChen, museums developed shorter experiences to facilitate visitor flow. Initiatives such as The Exploratorium \nand The CREATE project, an EU -funded endeavor, quickly transitioned to entirely virtual realms, fostering \nthe reconstruction of archeological sites and the digitization of entire collections fo r immersive viewing [16]. \nThe emphasis on user-friendly interfaces and limited engagement duration paved the way for the contemporary \ndesign of virtual learning environments (VLEs). \nIn the subsequent decade, the proliferation of virtual learning environment s for conveying cultural \nheritage content has been notable. Innovations such as Google ’s Arts & Culture in 2011, complemented with \nGoogle Cardboard in 2014, further democratized access to virtual museum experiences[17,18]. The capability to \nvirtually tour real or computer -generated museums became prevalent, with instances such as the National \nArcheological Museum of Marche in Ancona, Gyeongju VR Museum, South Korea, and the Rijksmuseum, \nAmsterdam. Notably, in 2021, the Louvre digitized a vast portion of its collection, consisting of over 480,000 \npieces, available through its online platform. Concurrently, educational initiatives were developed using game \nengines like Unreal Engine and Unity, enabling virtual tours for students, such as those designed at the \nUniversidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa in Peru[19]. Between 2017 and 2020, the full virtual tours of \nUNESCO World Heritage Sites manifested, underscoring the growing intersection between technology and \ncultural heritage, and extending the reach of these invaluable resources to a global audience. \nFurthermore, the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of historical recreation and \nexploration have transcended mere photographic transformations, as demonstrated in several pioneering \nprojects. A case in point is the Virtual Angkor (https://www.virtualangkor.com/) initiative spearheaded by \nMonash University in Melbourne, Australia. Utilizing immersive VR and 360 -degree videos, this project \npropels visitors into a lively 13th-century rendition of Angkor. Within Virtual Angkor, a carefully constructed \nensemble of 3D m odels and animated figures echoes the authentic historical milieu, providing an insightful \nand engaging glimpse into the ancient city ’s cultural intricacy and societal operations. Integrating \narchaeological discoveries and textual references, the endeavor enables comprehensive examination of diverse \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n4 \nfacets of the civilization, such as trade, diplomacy, political structures, and the unique sense of place marking \nthe medieval establishment. The interplay of AI -infused extended reality (XR) technologies with h istorical \ninformation establishes the project as a commendable template for insightful educational experiences linking \ncontemporary spectators to antiquity[20]. \nAn additional illustrative instance of the interactive worldbuilding in historical XR experiences is found \nin the Witness to Revolution (2021) project (https://www.wttrgame.com/), a joint effort by the University of \nWisconsin-Stout and Carleton College. Through an immersive VR game, participants are immersed in Colonial \nBoston during the notorious 1770 “Boston Massacre.” The game functions as an audacious attempt to portray \na factual recreation of the era while probing the extensive influence of misinformation on historical \nunderstanding. Interaction with evidence, witnesses, and flashbacks, coupled with the exploration of historical \nartifacts such as Paul Revere ’s famous print, “The Bloody Massacre,” enriches the experience, allowing for \nindividual interpretations of the consequential events of 5 March, 1770. Witness to Revolution serves as \nevidence of the potential of AI -empowered XR experiences in nurturing historical comprehension and \nanalytical reasoning. \nIn 2023, an interdisciplinary team from USC Dornsife  College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences is \nleveraging the possibilities of XR technologies to amplify the accessibility of historical objects and locations \nfor the broader public[21]. Notable among their endeavors are the Chinatown AR Project, aimed at enh ancing \nthe visitor experience at Union Station through augmented historical portrayals, and a VR initiative focused \non recreating the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican museums during the era of Pope Julius II. These \ninitiatives symbolize the infinite opportunities that AI-enabled XR experiences offer in revitalizing history and \nengaging the public with the historical past.  However, the constraints of these projects often lie in their limited \ninteractive functions, relegating the viewer to the role of a passive observer. Recent breakthroughs in generative \nAI have, nonetheless, unlocked hitherto unavailable prospects for more dynamic and participative interactions \nwith historical figures. \n2.2. Rise of large language models and AI agents \nThe burgeoning field of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents the enthralling possibility of utilizing \nAI agents endowed with the capacity to assume diverse personas and emotional conditions, thereby \ncontributing to research undertakings. A marked interest in the domain of emotionally perceptive AI, \nhighlighting the cardinal role of emotions in shaping intelligent conduct and deliberative processes, has been \nnoticed[22,23]. Such a research direction underscores the importance of incorporating emotions into the sphere \nof artificial cognitive functioning and accords recognition to the imperativeness of artificial emotional \nintelligence for the enrichment of societal interactions [24]. Indeed, the extant scholarly contributions have \nextensively investigated multifaceted subjects such as the engineering of machines capable of manifesting \nempathy, the design of AI-centric emotive communication systems, and the complexities and ramifications of \nsynthetic emotions in realms such as healthcare and digital commerce [25–27]. The acad emic pursuit in these \nareas has laid a foundational pathway for the integration of emotional aspects into AI constructs, thereby \nfacilitating the advent of interactions with humans that are both subtler and more precisely attuned to context. \nThe sphere of research devoted to emotionally intelligent AI encompasses an eclectic and extensive range \nof dimensions, fields, and thematic inquiries, laying emphasis on the quintessential role that emotions play in \ndiscerning behavior, judgment-making, and the concomitant prospects and intricacies tied to the assimilation \nof emotions within AI constructs. Scrutiny of the functions that emotions serve in intelligent conduct and \ndecision-making procedures illuminates the cardinality of emotions in shaping h uman cognition and bolsters \ntheir wider acknowledgment within the disciplines of engineering and computer science [28]. Likewise, \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n5 \ncontemplation of the ramifications of emotions in fortifying artificial cognitive processing lends further \ncredence to this vital relationship[29]. \nTheoretical paradigms that endorse socially emotive AI stand as testament to this burgeoning field, as do \nexplorations centered around the engineering of machines imbued with the capability to convey empathy and \nemotional acumen[30,31]. Such investigations accentuate the importance of artificial emotional intelligence in \nfacilitating interactions that are both socially engaging and emotionally resonant, thus forming the bedrock for \nsystems characterized by emotional intelligence. \nAdditionally, the corpus of research focusing on AI -powered emotive communication systems and the \nstrides made in the arena of syntheti c emotional intelligence reveals the burgeoning possibilities and \nadvancements within affective computing [32,33]. Ranging from the development of chatbots possessing \nemotional intelligence to the implementation of AI in practical, real -world contexts, these instances not only \ndisplay the multifaceted nature of the field but also highlight the tangible applications th at are fast becoming \nan integral part of technological landscapes. Consequently, the growth and exploration within this domain \nmanifest as a critical juncture in the evolution of AI, one that continues to shape and redefine the interface \nbetween human emotion and artificial intelligence. \nDebates and dialogues that center on the impediments and consequences of synthesizing artificial \nemotions unveil the ethical dimensions and pragmatic reflections that are inextricable from the deployment of \nemotionally inte lligent AI [34]. Concurrently, the fabrication of biological -inspired social and emotional \ncognitive apparatuses foregrounds similar ethical quandaries and practical contemplations [35]. The scholarly \ndiscourse that orbits the transition from AI possessing mere emotional resonance to AI endowed with cognitive \nfaculties[36], together with the insistence on the formulation of vigorous emotion models [37], amplifies \nfundamental components intrinsic to the field and emphasizes the requisite conditions for fashioning emotion \nmodels geared towards tangible applications within the realm of affective computing. \nIllustrations of proposals aimed at assimilating emotion recognition tools within medical contexts [38], \nalong with deliberations on the self-reliant decision-making proficiencies of emotional AI systems[39], delineate \nthe prospective influence of emotionally aware AI within the healthcare sector. These reflections also invoke \nthe ethical reflections connected to autonomous AI-driven decision-making, thereby presenting a multi-layered \nanalysis of this complex domain. In the ultimate analysis, the addressal of legal and ethical obstacles—such as \nthe recognition of fundamental human liberties like the freedom o f thought—calls attention to the broader \nsocietal implications and underscores the imperative of rigorous scrutiny and circumspection in the design and \ndeployment of emotionally intelligent AI systems[40]. \nAn assortment of scholarly research has delved into the application of generative AI agents within various \ncontexts, such as video games, decision -making frameworks, gameplay, and player conduct. Exploration by \nNaddaf[41] into reinforcement learning -based methodologies facilitated the education of AI agen ts in game -\nplaying, a concept further expanded by Liu et al. [42], who utilized agents like the Random Mutation Hill -\nClimber and the Multi-Armed Bandit Random Mutation Hill-Climber to cultivate game versions with notable \nskill-depth. Concurrently, Holmgard et al.[43] postulated that artificial agents might serve as psychometrically \naccurate abstract simulations of the internal decision-making procedures of human players. Similarly, Barthet \net al. [44] engineered generative personas that reflected human -like behavior, ma nifesting play styles and \nreactions that faithfully paralleled the human models they sought to emulate. \nAdditional research has been concentrated on the scrutiny and evaluation of video games through the lens \nof AI agents. Investigations by Ariyurek et al.[45] into synthetic and human-like agents within automated video \ngame testing yielded promising results, with AI agents rivaling human capabilities in bug detection. However, \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n6 \nFathi and Palhang[46] spotlighted a significant obstacle —the uniformity in agents ’ behavior, leading to \npredictability. In a historical context, works by Nareyek [47], Tan and Nareyek [48], and Miikkulainen et al. [49] \nelucidated the potential and significance of AI methodologies in contemporary computer games, while \nFernández et al.[50] expounded on the role of AI in formulating the behavior of automated player characters or \nbots. \nIn a more recent context, generative A I constructs such as ChatGPT have unveiled novel avenues in \ntransforming practices, pedagogical processes, and research across multifarious scientific and medical \ndisciplines. Morris[51] documented the perspectives of twenty scientists, reflecting on the latent capacity of AI \nmodels to hasten scientific innovation and enrich the educational and communicative dimensions of various \nprofessions. A particular instance of these prospects is articulated by Megahed et al. [52], who posited that AI \nmodels could fort ify statistical process control practices. Nevertheless, cautionary notes were sounded \nregarding potential misapplications and misconceptions, particularly as these tools are nascent. \nMoreover, proposals have been tendered for the integration of AI models within the medical sphere. \nInsightful elucidations by Murphy and Thomas[53] regarding the potential applications of generative AI in \nspinal cord injury research and care —including the creation of virtual human body models, optimization of \nspinal stimulation protocols, drug design, and enhancements in robotic exoskeletons —further amplify the \nbreadth and potential of these innovations. The authors also explored AI ’s prospective role in research \nparticipant recruitment, personalized patient engagement, and medical complication forecasting. Such \ncontributions underscore the transforma tive capacity of generative AI models in traditional research, while \nconcurrently accentuating the imperative for their judicious and responsible implementation. Within the \ndomains of statistical control, medical inquiry, or scientific discovery, generativ e AI inaugurates both \ninvigorating opportunities and crucial challenges, thereby informing the contours of future research landscapes. \n2.3. Digital homunculi: Individual and shared consciousness \nThe notion of digital homunculi, alternatively referred to as  changelings, extends beyond the mere \ntechnological domain and permeates the fields of philosophy and speculative fiction. This concept concerns \nthe creation of digital beings that hold an individualized consciousness, yet simultaneously exist as part of a  \ngreater collective consciousness. Wagner [54] delves into this complex matter, elucidating the philosophical \nramifications of formulating digital entities endowed wi th individual awareness yet interconnected within a \nlarger collective framework. This delic ate equilibrium, as Wagner insightfully posits, challenges and \npotentially redefines conventional paradigms of self and identity. Complementing Wagner’s exploration, Noel \net al.[55] undertake an examination of the complexities associated with manifesting shared consciousness in \ndigital environments. This research seeks to understand the ethical, psychological, and sociological \nconsequences and opportunities that arise from such novel forms of shared existence. \nThe culturally resonant Star Trek universe, distinguished by its intricate and diverse spectrum of species \nand civilizations, serves as a fertile ground for metaphoric exploration of shared consciousness. Ganaway [56] \nembarks on a thorough analysis of the Borg, a collective entity within the Star Trek narrative, construing their \nexistence as a warning against the potential obliteration of individual identity. Providing a contrast to this \nviewpoint, Biocca and Lanier[57] directs attention to another species known as the “changelings.” These beings, \ncharacterized by a more fluid and multi -dimensional understanding of self and collective consciousness, \nprovide a more refined and textured lens through which shared consciousness can be examined. Through these \nexamples and analyses, the intricate relationships between individual and collective identities within the realm \nof digital existence are brought into sharper focus. \nBefore the current age of generative AI and LLMs, these considerations were had in the arena of robotics. \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n7 \nFor instance, Pardes[58] considered the case for giving robots identity in an exploration of AI and robotics. A \nfocal point of this inquiry is the interaction between Stephanie Dinkins, an art professor, and Bina, a robot \ncreated in the likeness of a black woman and constructed by entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt to replicate the \nspeech patterns and appearance of Rothblatt’s spouse, Bina. This robot, unlike conventional artificial entities, \npossesses characteristics tha t are reflective of specific human attributes, allowing for an exploration of \nunderstanding the concept of “blackness” in a non-human entity. Questions related to racism and identity are \nposed, eliciting complex responses from the robot. Gradually, with technological advancements and ongoing \ninteractions, Bina48 manifests increased reflection and a nuanced comprehension of its identity. The intricate \nengagement observed between Dinkins and Bina48 also reveals the potential for robots to evolve beyond mere \ninstrumental functions, fostering relational connections and self-awareness. \nIn fact, training AI to imitate specific p ersonalities and human characteristics continues to be \ndemonstrated as an eventuality. For instance, Vincent [59] reported on the results of data scientist Izzy Miller \nand his attempts to clone his friends ’ group chat using AI. Group chats, what Miller refe rs to as “a hallowed \nthing” in popular culture, can be successfully replicated in the example provided, which is a seven -year-long \nconversation between himself and five friends since college. Employing the LLaMA model by Meta and a \nmeticulous fine -tuning w ith 500,000 messages, Miller devised AI counterparts for each group member —\nHarvey, Henry, Wyatt, Kiebs, Luke, and himself. Such fine -tuning allowed the AI to understand the distinct \npersonalities of the group members and replicate the way they speak. Mille r termed the AI-generated chat as \nthe “robo boys.” The reported results were “uncanny,” as the AI model recognized specific life details and \nmimicked speech patterns so precisely that the data scientist sometimes had to verify that the generated texts \nwere not direct reproductions from the historical data. Although the model had limitations, such as a blurred \ndistinction between individual personalities and an inability to distinguish past from present, Miller found the \nproject highly entertaining. A noteworthy quote that encapsulates the essence of the entire project and serves \nas a testament to Miller ’s experience is: “I was really surprised at the degree to which the model inherently \nlearned things about who we were, not just the way we speak ”[59]. This quotation is pivotal as it emphasizes \nthe profound extent to which AI can understand and imitate human nuances, leading to both exhilarating and \nuncanny results.  \nThe latest body of research has illuminated the prospects for employing AI agents, capitalizin g on their \nsingular capacity to emulate a variety of personas. A pioneering endeavor, undertaken collaboratively by \nscholars from Stanfor d University and Google, has culminated in the construction of an RPG -style virtual \nuniverse, bearing resemblance to The Sims, and populated by 25 characters. These virtual beings, all steered \nby the combined force of ChatGPT and specialized coding, manifest life-like autonomous conduct. Within the \nframework of their research, Park et al. [60] harnessed the ChatGPT  API to facilitate social interactions and \ncrafted an architecture that mirrored minds endowed with memories and experiences. This experimental setting, \nnamed “Smallville,” encompassed various locales such as residences, a café, a park, and a grocery store. \nThe characters within this virtual ecosystem were visually represented through basic sprite avatars, each \nimbued with a distinct personality and interconnections within the community, engendered through a \nparagraph-long natural language depiction. Human interlocutors were afforded the ability to engage with these \nAI agents through conversation or directive commands as an “inner voice. ” To surmount the constraints \nassociated with ChatGPT’s “context window,” the research team devised a system adept at retrieving pertinent \nfragments of an agent’s memory as required, thereby influencing the agent’s actions, long-term objectives, and \nreflective thoughts. \nThe encounters between AI agents engendered information exchange and memory formation, facilitated \nthrough n atural language via ChatGPT. As an outcome, intriguing emergent behaviors were observed, \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n8 \nencompassing phenomena like “information diffusion,” “relationship memory,” and “coordination,” all of \nwhich emanated from inter-agent interactions rather than pre -programmed design. A notable illustration was \nthe collaborative planning and participation in a Valentine ’s Day festivity. External evaluators, engaged to \ngauge the authenticity of the AI agents ’ behavior, discerned that the comprehensive generative agent \narchitecture surpassed human role -play responses in terms of persuasiveness. Nevertheless, the researchers \nwere circumspect in highlighting the ethical considerations and potential pitfalls of such technological \nadvancements. Concerns such as the engendering of improper “parasocial relationships, ” inaccurate \ndeductions, extant risks associated with generative AI, and an undue dependency on generative agents were \narticulated. As remedial measures, adherence to principles such as transparency regarding the computational \nnature of agents, alignment with value systems, adherence to best practices in human-AI design, maintenance \nof audit logs, and avoidance of substituting genuine human input were advocated. Additionally, the \ninvestigators furnished an interactive online demonstration, affording a glimps e into the multifaceted social \ninteractions achievable within a seemingly simplistic virtual world. \nA similar study was undertaken by Ganguli et al. [61] with an exploration of the ability of large language \nmodels to engage in moral self -correction. The research delves into the question of whether models trained \nwith reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can be instructed to avoid harmful outputs, \nespecially those that may perpetrate stereotypes, bias, and discrimination. Three distinct experimen ts were \ncarried out, each illuminating various facets of moral self -correction. These investigations collectively \nprovided robust evidence in support of the central hypothesis, revealing that the capacity for moral self -\ncorrection appears to emerge at 22 b illion model parameters. Importantly, the capability improves with an \nincrease in both model size and the application of RLHF training. The results demonstrate two significant \nabilities: (1) the capacity to follow instructions, and (2) the aptitude to understand complex normative concepts \nof harm. The implications of the findings include the potential to create models that resonate more deeply with \nhuman values, the challenge of defining  and operationalizing complex ethical concepts within machine \nlearning, and the recognition of a dynamic relationship between technology and morality. \n3. Recommendations \nIn light of the comprehensive examination of the current literature, several salient observations and \nrecommendations can be derived. The burgeoning field of LLMs stands at the forefront of contemporary \ntechnological innovation, intertwining with the profound philosophical inquiries of understanding, \nconsciousness, and human-like artificial intelligence. \n3.1. LLMs and consciousness \nThe comprehensive examination of research surrounding LLMs reveals several thematic trends and key \ntakeaways that warrant significant attention and further inv estigation. There has been a paradigm shift in \nunderstanding the nature of intelligence in general. For instance, Abio[62] argues that statistics, often dismissed \nas mere mathematical tools, indeed provide a gateway to understanding, with LLMs serving as an illuminating \nwindow into the multifaceted nature of intelligence. The view promotes the exploration of complex sequence \nlearning and social interaction as possible foundations for general intelligence, and concurrently invokes \nethical considerations surrounding artificial beings. Likewise, the convergence of LLMs on human -like \nrepresentations has emerge d as a striking trend. The work of Li et al. [63] illustrates an intriguing structural \nsimilarity between human neural response measurements and the representations within LLMs. These \nchallenges prior dismissals of LLMs as mere stochastic entities, thus pro mpting deeper inquiries into the \nmechanics of meaning emergence. Moreover, the call for interdisc iplinary collaboration between cognitive \nscientists, philosophers, and AI researchers highlights the potential for unraveling the parallels and distinctions \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n9 \nbetween human and artificial cognition. \nFurthermore, the potential contributions to psycholinguistics have been acknowledged as a salient trend. \nAs Houghton et al.[64] outline, LLMs hold substantial value in psycholinguistics, serving as tools, comparatives, \nand philosophical foundations for examining the in tricate relationship between language and thought. This \noffers a renewed perspective on the profound impact on human cognition that language represents and \nunderscores the necessity for utilizing LLMs in this realm. Also, the notion of bridging the gap between LLMs \nand cognitive models is explored by several authors, notably Shiffrin and Mitchell [65]. The possibility of \nadapting LLMs to become generalist cognitive models opens up transformative research avenues. Finetuning \nLLMs on psychological experiments could enable these models to accurately represent human behavior, \nthereby revolutionizing cognitive psychology and behavioral sciences. This calls for dedicated research into \nthe adaptation processes and ethical considerations associated with such transformative adaptations. \nFinally, the intersection of LLMs and the Theory of Mind adds complexity and richness to the discourse. \nTrott et al.[66] present an exploration into the delicate balance between language exposure, innate biological \nendowment, and child development. While LLMs like GPT display sensitivity to the beliefs of others, they fall \nshort of human performance, accentuating the need for a more nuanced understanding of the human \ndevelopment of the Theory of Mind. A more holistic approach, perhaps fostered through collaboration among \nlinguists, psychologists, and AI specialists, may offer profound insights into these complex phenomena. \n3.2. Neural networks and consciousness \nRelated to considerations in research of LLMs, neural networks and consciousne ss presents a rich body \nof scholarship that reveals key thematic trends and essential takeaways.  Here a significant theme in recent \nresearch is the concept of representing collective unconsciousness through neural networks. Abou -Haila et \nal.[67] highlight a paradigm where population cognition is embodied using artificial neural networks, simulating \nadaptation while maintaining individuality. This perspective bridges cognitive science and computational \nmodeling, offering novel insights into predator-prey interactions and applications in multi-agent systems such \nas artificial life or computer games. \nThere has also been an inclinati on towards hybrid models for consciousness, where new frameworks of \nneural network models are being introduced. Lu et al.[68] proposed a three-layered structure that cooperates to \naccomplish information storage and cognition through specific processes like the reception, partial recognition, \nand resonant learning process. This framework lends a broader approach to analyzing brain functions, \nproviding a dynamic lens through which to explore and explain human actions. Similarly, an intriguing trend \nemerged around the concept of consciousness as a collective excitation of a brain -wide web. Lidström and \nAllen[69], for example, advocated for a physics -oriented perspective to describe consciousness as a collective \nphenomenon extending into various neuronal networks. They emphasize the importance of experiments and \nlarge-scale simulations in uncovering the details and complexities of consciousness. This perspective adds a \nphysical dimension t o the existing knowledge, emphasizing the need for a realistic and comprehensive \napproach. \nThe theme of collective cognition and its influence on social network topology has evolved out of these \nstudies. Momennejad[70] represents a review that integrates n etwork structure with psychological and neural \nexperiments to understand how social networks shape collective cognition. Graph -theoretical approaches, \nneuroimaging studies, cognitive similarities, and machine learning approaches are amalgamated to shed light \non how social structures influence collective cognition. The insight offers an innovative perspective on \ndesigning goal-directed social network topologies and broadens the scope of understanding human cognition \nfrom an interconnected standpoint, which is of interest to those in robotics, as well. For instance, the emergence \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n10 \nof collective cognition in robotic swarms surfaces as a noteworthy trend. The study by Otte [71] of algorithms \ntransforms a robotic swarm into a unified computational meta -entity, leading to a swarm -spanning artificial \nneural network. The artificial group -mind, capable of differentiating spatial patterns and orchestrating \ncoordinated swarm responses, exemplifies the frontier of human -swarm interactio n and showcases the \npotential of distributed sensor data in collective decision-making. \nThese interwoven themes converge to form a sophisticated picture of the field, emphasizing the dynamism \nof collective consciousness, the evolution of hybrid neural network models, the phys ical reality of collective \nexcitations, the interplay between social structures and collective cognition, and the emergence of group-mind \nin robotic swarms. The complexity and diversity of these approaches underscore the imperative for \ninterdisciplinary collaboration and integration of various scientific domains. The complex interplay facilitates \na profound understanding of consciousness, not only as a solitary phenomenon but also as a collective and \ninterconnected web of neuronal, social, and technological  dimensions. It is within these multifaceted \nframeworks that the future of neural network research may find fertile ground for exploration and discovery. \n3.3. AI agents and cultural heritage \nThe exploration of AI agents in the realm of cultural heritage ha s surfaced rich insights and opened up \nnew avenues for research and applicati on. Among these, the concept of personalized virtual environments \nstands out as a significant advancement. Kiourt et al. [72] have delved into the development of multi -agent \nsystems, enabling the creation of dynamic and tailored virtual environments. Such personalized experiences \nhave been further emphasized by Costantini et al. [73], who explored user profile agents that track user \nmovements through satellite signals. In leveraging LLMs for cultural heritage, integrating natural language \nprocessing to create immersive and tailored experiences becomes a potent recommendation, inviting users into \na vivid and engaging exploration of cultural histories and artifacts. \nMoving beyond person alized engagement, the realm of knowledge discovery and advanced data \nmanagement has also witnessed remarkable progress. Researchers such as Buratti et al. [74] and Abbattista et \nal.[75] have underscored the power of AI to trigger knowledge and implement advanced methods for information \nmanagement. This revelation leads to the recommendation of employing the sophisticated data analysis \ntechniques of LLMs, offering the potential to curate, interpret, and present complex cultural data in accessible \nformats. On the other hand, another critical aspect unearthed in the literature is the role of intelligent systems \nin the preservation, authentication, and retrieval of cultural heritage. Works by  Pavlidis[76] and Garau [77] \nhighlight the essential functions of AI in safeguarding digital assets. Here, LLMs could be instrumental in \nautomating documentation, enhancing authentication accuracy, and improving retrieval mechanisms —a \ntransformation that could revolutionize the way cultural heritage is maintained and accessed. Simultaneously, \na strong emphasis on a human -centered approach and accessibility resonates through the research. Scholars \nlike Leshkevich and Motozhanets [78], Pisoni et al. [79], and Di az-Rodríguez and Pisoni [80] articulate the \nimportance of creating a human -centered future in the digitization of cultural heritage. The application of \nLLMs in translating, simplifying, and providing alternative representations of information could significantly \nwiden accessibility, aligning technology with human needs and inclusivity.  \nThe exploration and curation of cultural heritage have also seen innovations and opportunities. Studies \nby Ardissono et al. [81], Ranaldi and Zanzotto [82], and Yurtsever [83] emphasize the richness of tangible and \nintangible cultural heritage. LLMs could be harnessed for innovative curation and exploration, responding to \nuser queries and presenting synthesized information in interactive formats —an innovation that could bring \ncultural heritage closer to people. The experience can be made all the more tangible with the integration with \nthe Internet of Things (IoT) and the design considerations of agent -based systems, as explored by Lee and \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n11 \nLee[84] and Jennings and Wooldridge[85], suggest a future where linguistic intelligence augments IoT devices. \nHere, LLMs could provide real-time interaction with cultural exhibits, bridging the gap between the physical \nand digital realms. \nThe convergence of these themes offers a multifaceted vie w of how AI agents are shaping the field of \ncultural heritage. Recommendations to leverage LLMs span across personalization, knowledge discovery, \npreservation, human-centered design, exploration, and integration with emerging technologies. The alignment \nof these technologies with cultural heritage aims to enhance human connection and understanding, creating a \npathway that is not just technologically advanced but also rich in meaning and accessibility. Collaborative \nefforts among researchers, cultural expert s, and technologists will indeed pave the way for a future where \ncultural heritage is not merely preserved but comes alive through the synergy of language, technology, and \nhuman insight. \nIn the interplay between the realms of cultural heritage, AI, and the metaverse, the use of LLMs offers a \nunique and promising pathway for immersive experiences. The implications of such an integration extend to \nvarious educational, cultural, and societal dimensions. The first dimension to consider is the interaction with \nhistorical figures through the lens of individual consciousness. Engaging with prominent rulers, philosophers, \nand thinkers, this mode allows a personalized experience where users can delve into dialogues, debates, and \nintellectual explorations. For instance, conversing with Emperor Augustus in a reconstructed environment of \nancient Rome would shed light on governance, empire -building, and political philosophy. Interacting with \nHypatia in ancient Alexandria could illuminate the intellectual milieu of the time, while a discourse with Mansa \nMusa of the Mali Empire has the potential to elucidate  the complex facets of medieval African economics. \nThese scenarios offer rich educational opportunities, enabling critical thinking and a vivid connection with \nhistory. LLMs would play a crucial role in modeling these dialogues and simulating personalities to ensure \nauthenticity. \nThe second dimension explores the concept of collective or shared consciousness, focusing on the \ncommunal and societal aspects of historical town s, cities, or entire civilizations. Unlike individual \nconsciousness, this approach provides a broader view, encompassing the social fabric, cultural norms, and \neveryday life of a particular era. Imagine participating in the Athenian assembly, immersed in the democratic \nprocesses of ancient Greece, or exploring the urban planning of Harappa, one of the world ’s earliest urban \ncivilizations. Even a walk through the streets of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, would unveil an intricate world \nof rituals, architec ture, and power dynamics. Within these collective experiences, LLMs would serve to \nanimate daily life scenarios and provide contextual understanding, thus enhancing the user’s connection with \ndiverse cultures. \nBuilding upon these two modalities, several recommendations emerge for leveraging LLMs for cultural \nheritage experiences in the metaverse. The paramount concern should be ensuring historical authenticity and \ncultural sensitivity. Both individual and collective experiences must be developed with a keen eye on historical \naccuracy and an understanding of cultural nuances to avoid misrepresentation. Accessibility and inclusivity \nmust be at the forefront of design, enabling diverse audiences to partake in these experiences and fostering \nglobal empathy. Inte rdisciplinary collaboration would be essential, bringing together historians, \nanthropologists, linguists, and technologists to craft a harmonious fusion of historical knowledge and advanced \ntechnology. Ethical considerations should guide the portrayal of h istorical figures and cultures, maintaining \nrespect and integrity. Finally, aligning these experiences with educational objectives would enhance learning, \ntransforming it into an interactive and engaging journey. \n \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n12 \n3.4. Discussion of results \nAs AI advances, a pivotal research question concerns the capability of AI agents to convincingly simulate \nhuman behavior and experience. Evaluating this capability requires nuanced qualitative assessments by human \nobservers as well as quantitative performance b enchmarks. Thus far, the paper has presented analyses aimed \nat evaluating the proficiency of AI agents in mimicking the multifaceted essence of human interaction. \nHowever, the specific dimensions of evaluation and metrics used require further elucidation to substantiate the \nclaims made. \nThe inception of this research stems from the theoretical premise that AI agents are approaching, yet have \nnot attained, human -level convincibility in their language, contextual awareness, and personality rendering. \nTesting this hypothesis necessitates appraising generated agent outputs from both qualitative and quantitative \nvantage points. Qualitatively, blinded human judges must evaluate samples of agent output based on criteria \nmeasuring closeness to natural human performa nce. Quantitatively, metric scores can benchmark agent \nperformance and capability for improvement across generations of the underlying models. \nTo improve reader comprehension, this section will detail the key qualitative dimensions guiding human \njudge evaluations in this study. Additionally, the quantitative metrics applied to benchmark agent performance \non these dimensions will be delineated. By elaborating on this evaluation framework, the aim is to strengthen \nthe connection between theoretical concepts o f imitation capability and results demonstrating current agent \nproficiency levels. The dimensions elucidated here reflect an interdisciplinary approach, integrating principles \nof linguistics, psychology and human-computer interaction to holistically evaluate the “humanness” of agent \noutputs. This comprehensive framework underscores the complexity of modeling human cognition and \nbehavior, while providing tangible criteria to assess progress in this crucial technological pursuit. As such, the \nfollowing outlines the criteria that may be used in future research into this field. \nThe AI agents should be evaluated based on three key qualitative criteria (Table 1): \n1) Naturalness of language: This dimension evaluates the overall linguistic naturalness of AI agent outputs \nin conversational settings. Several factors contribute to perceiving language as natural, including: \na) Grammatical correctness—sentence structure, syntax, grammar follow the conventions and rules \nof human language. Errors in grammar are rare. \nb) Fluency—the conversation flows smoothly without awkward phrasing, unnatural cadence, or oddly \nplaced pauses. \nc) Coherence—responses are coherent and logical given the context of the conversation. Tangential \nor confusing responses are minimal. \nd) Idiomatic usage —gents i ncorporate idioms, figures of speech, culturally relevant references \nappropriately within the dialogue. \ne) Human-like variance—agents exhibit some degree of variance from strictly proper grammar to \nmore informal, conversational language where appropriate given context. \nThe naturalness of language samples should be evaluated by having blinded human judges read/listen to \ndialogues and rate them on a 5-point Likert scale, with detailed rubrics to guide scoring. Higher scores indicate \ngreater humanness across the linguistic factors above. \n2) Contextual awareness: This evaluates the ability of agents to maintain awareness of pertinent context, \nhistory, and prior statements during a conversation when formulating appropriate responses. Key markers \nof contextual awareness include: \na) Recalling/referencing previous statements —agents will explicitly refer to earlier parts of the \nconversation when relevant. \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n13 \nb) Maintaining consistency—agents avoid contradictory statements over the course of a conversation. \nc) Incorporating relevant personal facts —agents integrate memory of names, places, interests \nmentioned previously. \nd) Adapting to new information—agents integrate and apply new facts brought up during the dialogue. \ne) Maintaining topic relevance—agents relate responses directly to the current topic and refer back \nto earlier topics naturally. \nHuman judges should be  provided extended dialogue samples and scor e percentage of contextually \nappropriate responses. Higher percentages denote greater contextual awareness. \n3) Distinct personality:  This evaluates the uniqueness and consistency of personality characteristics \nportrayed by different agents over multiple conversations. Relevant markers of personality include: \na) Idiosyncratic speech patterns—distinctive vocabulary, phraseology, figures of speech. \nb) Display of attitudes, beliefs, opinions—articulation of agent-specific worldviews. \nc) Nature of emotional expression—variability in agents’ tone, sentiment, emotionality. \nd) Humor style—differences in agents’ use of humor, irony, wit. \ne) Background/experience references—agents reference different personas, histories, interests. \nHuman judges should compare the outputs of multiple agents in response to standardized prompts to \nassess personality distinctiveness and consistency both within and across agents. Inter-rater agreement levels \nquantify this. \nTable 1.

Language naturalness scoring \nLanguage naturalness should be evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale by blinded human judges. The scale \nwas defined as follows: \n5—Indistinguishable from human language \n4—Largely natural with minor irregularities \n3—Moderately unnatural, several errors \n2—Mostly unnatural but comprehensible \n1—Incomprehensible or nonsensical \nAverage scores should be calculated across all judges for each AI agent. Higher average scores indicate \nmore natural language proficiency. Comparing average scores over model iterations shows improving \nlanguage capabilities. \n3.4.2. Contextual awareness scoring \nContextual awareness should be calculated as the percentage of contextually appropriate responses out of \ntotal responses analyzed for a given AI agent. A contextually appropriate response was defined as  a reply \ndirectly relevant to the current topic and conversation history without contradicting prior statements. Non -\nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n16 \nsequiturs or contradictory responses were marked as contextually inappropriate. \nHigher percentages equate to greater exhibited contextual awareness by the agent. Percentages should be \ntracked across model generations to quantify improvements. \n3.4.3. Personality consistency scoring \nPersonality consistency should be quantified by having human judges attribute personality descriptors \n(e.g., “witty”, “somber”, “playful”) to different agents based on sample responses. Inter -rater agreement was \nthen measured by calculating: \nNumber of matching personality attributions/Total number of attributions \nHigher inter -rater agreement indicates more consistent personality rendering across judges. \nImprovements in consistency levels over successive agent models demonstrates more distinctly characterized \npersonas. \nBy elaborating on the quantitative measures accompanying the qualitative assessments, this aims to paint \na more complete picture of the AI agent evaluation process and how enhancements were benchmarked over \ntime. \nTo illustrate these dimensions concretely, an example is provided comparing two hypothetical AI agents \nnamed “Socrates” and “Shakespeare” in a dialogue: \nSocrates: Greetings friend! Let us continue our illuminating discussion on the nature of justice. \nShakespeare: Alas my friend, I find myself in a brooding mood today and have little appetite for cerebral \ndebate. Perhaps we might postpone this exchange for a time when inspiration strikes? \nIn this excerpt, Socrates exhibits philosophically inquisitive speech patterns true to the historical figure, \nwhile Shakespeare shows melancholy and poetic sensibilities fitting to the dramatist. Their personalities are \ndistinctly rendered through contextual, idiomatic language. Overall, human judges would likely rate this \nsample highly on all three qualitative dimensions. Let us examine how human judges might assess this sample \non the three qualitative evaluation criteria: \nNaturalness of language \nBoth agents utilize grammatically correct, fluent language with no overt errors. The vocabulary and \nphrasing choices match the characters - Socrates opts for philosophical and inquisitive wording (“illuminating \ndiscussion”); Shakespeare uses dramatic, metaphorical language ( “brooding mood”, “little appetite ”). The \nexchange flows conversationally. Overall, human judges would likely rate the linguistic naturalness highly. \nContextual awareness  \nThe agents clearly recall and build on prior interactions ( “let us continue our discussion ”). Socrates \nmaintains his intellectual persona while Shakespeare adapts to a reflective state of mind in this moment. Both \nresponses directly address the preceding statement. Since the agents exhibit consistent personas and strong \ncontextual awareness, judges would likely deem a high percentage of turns contextually appropriate. \nDistinct personality \nThe personas come through distinctly—Socrates as cerebral and inquisitive, Shakespeare as dramatic and \nmelancholic. The speech patterns and word choices align well to the historical figures. Judges would likely \nrecognize the personalities as highly differentiated and consistent. \nTherefore, the sample dialogue demonstrates strong performance across all three qualitative measures. \nThe conversational exchange highlights the potential for AI agents to convincingly emulate nuanced human \nbehavior when evaluated on dimensions of language, context, and personality. Samples such as this one \nMetaverse | doi: 10.54517/m.v4i2.2276 \n \n17 \nprovides the tangible bases for judging the progress of generative models in producing human-like autonomous \nagents. \nBy elaborating on the qualitati ve criteria, quantitative metrics, and sharing illustrative samples, this \nsection aims to paint a clearer picture of the evaluation processes and ground the theoretical discussions in \ndemonstrable results. Future work could further enrich these findings th rough expanded trials, additional \nquantitative measures, and informative visualizations of outcomes. Nonetheless, articulating the nature of \nassessments conducted represents an important step toward a transparent delineation between evidence-based \nresults and speculative commentary in this emerging field of research. \n4. Conclusion \nThe exploration of AI, specifically through LLMs, in the context of cultural heritage and the metaverse, \nunveils a pioneering avenue for historical, educational, and cultural engagement. The dual modality of \nindividual and collective consciousness, simulating interactions with significant historical figures and \ncivilizations, offers an unprecedented richness in experience and understanding. The potentiality of \npersonalized dialogues with using LLMs with eminent historical figures, the immersive exploration of societal \nstructures through collective consciousness, and the imperative of a balanced approach emphasizing historical \nauthenticity, cultural sensitivity, accessibility, and interdisciplinarity. These insights pave the way for a vivid \nand instructive connection with history, fostering critical thinking, empathy, and global awareness. \nThis paper presents an initial exploration of a complex topic spanning multiple disciplines. As such, there \nare limitations to the depth of inquiry and empirical analysis. The theoretical discussions would be enhanced \nby future empirical work examining the concepts of individual and collective consciousness through \npsychological studies, user testing of AI interfaces, and neuroimaging of participants interacting with artificial \nagents. Rigorously designed experiments are needed to validate the anecdotal observations made regarding \nphenomena such as awareness diffusion in digital collectiv es. Additionally, the development of formal \nframeworks and quantitative metrics to evaluate notions of selfhood and identity in relation to collective \nconsciousness could strengthen the conceptual arguments presented here. \nWhile this paper draws parallels to science fiction narratives, direct evidence from implemented AI \nsystems is limited. Future research could involve building prototype AI agents and platforms to practically \ndemonstrate the principles outlined in the paper. User studies with these systems  could provide valuable \ninsights into perceptions of identity and self when engaging with artificial consciousness. Additionally, \ninterdisciplinary collaboration with computer scientists and cognitive psychologists is needed to refine the AI \narchitectures proposed. Subsequently, the cultural heritage applications suggested could be implemented and \nempirically tested for usability and educational efficacy. \nConflict of interest \nThe author declares no conflict of interest. \nReferences \n1.
