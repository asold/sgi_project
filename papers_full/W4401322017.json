  "abstract": "This paper introduces a user-centered data privacy protection framework utilizing large language models (LLMs) and user attention mechanisms, which are tailored to address urgent privacy concerns in sensitive data processing domains like financial computing and facial recognition. The innovation lies in a novel user attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention weights based on data characteristics and user privacy needs, enhancing the ability to identify and protect sensitive information effectively. Significant methodological advancements differentiate our approach from existing techniques by incorporating user-specific attention into traditional LLMs, ensuring both data accuracy and privacy. We succinctly highlight the enhanced performance of this framework through a selective presentation of experimental results across various applications. Notably, in computer vision, the application of our user attention mechanism led to improved metrics over traditional multi-head and self-attention methods: FasterRCNN models achieved precision, recall, and accuracy rates of 0.82, 0.79, and 0.80, respectively. Similar enhancements were observed with SSD, YOLO, and EfficientDet models with notable increases in all performance metrics. In natural language processing tasks, our framework significantly boosted the performance of models like Transformer, BERT, CLIP, BLIP, and BLIP2, demonstrating the framework’s adaptability and effectiveness. These streamlined results underscore the practical impact and the technological advancement of our proposed framework, confirming its superiority in enhancing privacy protection without compromising on data processing efficacy.",
