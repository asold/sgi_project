Their impressive\nrecommendation performance [16, 8, 22] and language generation\ncapability [20] have attracted the attention of researchers in the\nconversational recommender system (CRS) community [4, 13, 21,\n7]. For example, Google Research team [4] recently proposed an\nLLM-based CRS that achieved huge success on YouTube. LLMs are\ninherently well-suited to the needs of CRS. Unlike traditional recom-\nmender systems, which depend on user profiles and past activities,\nCRS prioritizes the identification of user preferences through real-\ntime interactions [17, 21, 4], striving to mimic the interactions of\nhuman recommenders [6, 12]. These characteristics require strong\ncapabilities in language understanding and generation [12, 25], ar-\neas where LLMs excel. Consequently, there is an increasing trend\nof adopting LLMs within the CRS domain.\nHowever, existing studies also found a significant weakness of\nLLMs when implemented into conversational recommendation [21,\n13]: the behavior of LLMs lacks proactiveness and adaptivity through-\nout dialogues, therefore leads to the shortage of information for\nunderstanding the users’ preference [13].\nTo validate these findings, we conducted a comparative analysis\ninvolving two popular LLMs and a human recommender across 20\nrandomly selected datapoints from INSPIRED dataset [6], the only\npopular conversational recommendation dataset providing behav-\nior labels. This comparison revealed a noticeable difference in the\nbehavior of LLM-based CRS and human recommenders. Specifically,\nLLM-based CRS systems tend to be passive and inflexible, often\nrushing to make recommendations without conducting any inquiry.\nIn contrast, human recommenders display much greater patience,\ndynamism, and adaptability. They show a wider range of complex\ninformation-seeking strategies contributing to recommendations,\nas illustrated in Figure 1. A more tangible illustration is that human\nrecommenders averagely conduct 2.5 conversational turns before\nmaking their first recommendation, a number far exceeds those\nby GPT3.5[14] or Llama2[18], as shown in Table 1. The user infor-\nmation obtained from initial inquiries helps human recommenders\nmake better recommendations and achieve higher success rates.\nRecently, many studies on LLMs have focused on improving their\nbehavior alignment with humans [14, 10, 1]. The alignment between\nthe generated sentences from CRS and human recommenders is\nalso desirable for LLM-based CRS. First, better behavior alignment\ncan enhance the user experience by creating a more efficient and\nproactively interactive conversation. More importantly, the ability\nto use complex recommendation strategies can help the system re-\nceive more user preference information and better understand user\nprofiles, leading to more accurate recommendations [6]. Despite\narXiv:2404.11773v2  [cs.IR]  17 Oct 2024\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Dayu Yang, Fumian Chen, & Hui Fang\nFigure 1: Comparing the strategies that LLM typically uses\nand human recommenders use for making conversational\nrecommendations.\n#Turns before Rec Success Rate\nLLM-based CRS\nGPT 3.5 1.158 15.8%\nLlama 2 1.000 5.3%\nReference\nHuman 2.500 57.1%\nTable 1: Comparing the behavior of LLM-based CRSs and hu-\nman’s behavior including: average length of conversational\nturns before making the first recommendation(#Turns be-\nfore Rec), average success rate.\nthe importance of measuring behavior alignment, the evaluation\nmetrics currently used in CRS have no ability to measure this.\nTo fill this gap, we propose a new evaluation metric: Behavior\nAlignment, a metric that explicitly evaluates how well LLM-based\nCRS’s recommendation strategies are aligned with humans. We\nalso conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nmeasure. In particular, Behavior Alignment has high agreement\nwith the human preferences, and can differentiate the performance\nof different LLM-based CRS systems much better than the exist-\ning metrics. However, one limitation of Behavior Alignment is\nthe requirement of having human annotations of recommendation\nstrategies, which can be costly and time-consuming to obtain. To\novercome this limitation, we propose a classification-based method\nto implicitly estimate the behavior alignment without the annota-\ntions of recommendation strategies. Experiment results confirm\nthe robustness of the proposed implicit estimation of the Behavior\nAlignment measure across multiple CRS datasets.\n2 RELATED WORK\nExisting research practices primarily evaluate CRS’s performance in\ntwo aspects: recommendation accuracy, and the quality of sentence\ngeneration. In terms of recommendation accuracy, most CRS studies\nadopt metrics from traditional recommender systems, like hit rates,\nprecision, and recall, from IR community [24, 5].\nTo evaluate the quality of generated sentences, automatic metrics\nborrowed from dialogue systems, such as Perplexity, BLEU, and\nDIST, are used [2, 26, 24, 19]. However, their alignment withquality\nand user satisfaction in the context of CRS is questioned [9, 23].\nUnder such questions, several manual evaluation metrics are\nproposed. Chen et al. [2] advocated for Consistency. Zhou et al. [25]\nproposed fluency and informativeness as substitutes for BLEU. How-\never, with the introduction of LLM for building CRS [7, 11, 21, 4],\nfluency and informativeness have lost their relevance as LLM can\ngenerate highly fluent sentences and the informativeness can be\nconveniently adjusted by prompting. In addition, manual evalu-\nation’s inherent subjectivity and cost can pose a challenge. Con-\nsequently, recent works in LLM-based CRS [7, 11] opted to only\nevaluate CRS based on accuracy metrics, and overlooked the quality\nof generated sentences.\n3 BEHAVIOR ALIGNMENT: THE METRIC\nUsers tend to find the conversations more natural and engaging\nwith human recommenders. And those conversations often lead\nto better recommendations compared with automatic conversa-\ntional recommender systems [6]. This is largely because human\nrecommenders usually deploy various sociable and preference elic-\nitation strategies to grab more personal information of users [6].\nIn addition, we and existing studies [13, 21] consistently observed\na substantial disparity between human’s strategies and those em-\nployed by LLM-based CRS where latter often appears naive and\npassive. Therefore, human recommenders’ behaviors could become\nvaluable references for the LLM-based CRS.\n3.1 Definition\nBased on the assumption that human recommenders’ behaviors\ncan perform as good references for CRS, given a context (e.g., user’s\npast interactions with a CRS), a CRS generate a response 𝐶. And\na human recommender writes a response 𝐻 for the same context.\nAssuming we know the recommendation strategy of 𝐶 is 𝑅𝐶 and\nthe recommendation strategy of 𝐻 is 𝑅𝐻, the behavior alignment\nscore of the pair (i.e., 𝐵𝐴(𝐶,𝐻)) can be computed as in Equation\n(1). In a test collection with 𝑁 generated responses, the system’s\nBehavior Alignment score can be calculated using Equation (2).\n𝐵𝐴(𝐶,𝐻) =\n(\n1 𝑖𝑓 𝑅𝐶 = 𝑅𝐻\n0 𝑖𝑓 𝑅𝐶 ≠ 𝑅𝐻\n(1)\n𝐵𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟 𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡=\nÍ\n𝑘=2..𝑁 𝐵𝐴(𝐶𝑘,𝐻𝑘)\n𝑁 (2)\nIn Equation (2), the first interactive turn is not counted into\nBehavior Alignment since the start point of every conversation can\nbe random in practice. After the first turn is finished, the behaviors\nof following turns should conditioned on the existing context.\nFor recommendation strategy 𝑅, existing CRS studies [6] have\nprovided a comprehensive categorization that includes 13 mutu-\nally exclusive types. These types are: acknowledgment, redibility,\nencouragement, experience inquiry , offer help , opinion inquiry , per-\nsonal experience , personal opinion , preference confirmation, rephrase\npreference, self modeling , similarity, and transparency.\n4 BEHAVIOR ALIGNMENT: EFFECTIVENESS\nAS AN EVALUATION METRIC\nBehavior Alignment can measure the behavior differences between\ngenerated sentences from CRS and human recommenders, but it re-\nmains unclear whether such a metric is more desirable than existing\nmetrics. To answer this question, we design two sets of experiments\nto evaluate (1) whether Behavior Alignment reflects user preferences ;\nand (2) whether it can differentiate well-performed systems from those\npoorly performed ones .\nBehavior Alignment: A New Perspective of Evaluating LLM-based Conversational Recommender Systems SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\nFigure 2: Agreement with human judgments over \"Is the\nresponse from Falcon-based CRS better than Llama2-based\nCRS ?\", measured by Cohen’s Kappa.\n4.1 Agreement with Human Preferences\nThe first set of experiments aims to assess whether the evaluation\nresults of Behavior Alignment are closely consistent with human\npreferences. Specifically, responses from two CRS systems are eval-\nuated by Behavior Alignment and humans. A strong agreement\nbetween them would reflect the effectiveness of a metric.\nWe randomly sampled 1,000 instances from INSPIRED dataset.\nThe two CRS systems are built on two LLMs respectively: Falcon-\n7B [15] and Llama2-7B [18]. They were specifically chosen due\nto the distinct training data they utilize, which leads to varying\nresponse styles in reaction to dialog histories. To gauge human\npreferences, we enlisted two annotators who have experience in\nconversational recommendations. They assumed the role of CRS\nusers and annotated preferences on the responses generated by the\ntwo LLM-based CRS systems (i.e., same, A is better than B, or B is\nbetter than A). In addition to preferences between the two systems,\nwe ask an expert trained with linguistic backgrounds to annotate\nthe recommendation strategies for each generated response, which\nis necessary for computing Behavior Alignment.\nAn ideal evaluation metric should yield ratings that highly cor-\nrelate to human preferences [3]. We use Cohen’s Kappa to measure\nsuch correlation. In addition to Cohen’s Kappa, we employed the\nBootstrap method to establish the 2.5% to 97.5% confidence interval.\nTo compare how various metrics reveal user preferences, we\nconduct a comparative analysis with two popular automatic metrics\nthat existing CRS studies used to evaluate generation quality [2, 25,\n24]: BLEU@K and DIST@K. The results are depicted in Figure 2.\nWe can see Behavior Alignment demonstrates a considerable\nlevel of agreement with human preference, as evidenced by a Co-\nhen’s Kappa of 0.74, a value typically interpreted as indicating\n\"Substantial Agreement\". On the contrary, DIST@K and BLEU@K\nexhibit a much lower level of agreement with human preferences.\nOne potential reason for the poor alignment is they are word-level\nmetrics that are directly adopted from Machine Translation and\nSummarization tasks, which do not fit the context and goal of the\nconversational recommendation task very well [3].\n4.2 Differentiation of System Performance\nA desirable evaluation metric should be able to differentiate various\nsystems [3]. Also, the increase/decrease of rating should be consis-\ntent with the increase/decrease of human preference for different\nsystems. However, it is hard to quantify human preference for each\nLLM-based CRS and it is almost impossible to find large numbers\nFigure 3: Metric score changes (y-axis) along with human\npreference changes (x-axis)\nof LLMs covering different levels of human preferences to meet the\nnecessity for conducting evaluations.\nTo address these challenges, we build synthetic LLM-based CRS\nsystems with different levels of user preferences by mixing dif-\nferent ratios of \"good generations\" and \"bad generations\" based\non the annotated sentences generated from two LLM-based CRS\nwe implemented. Specifically, 100 generation pairs were randomly\nchosen from annotated data, with one system’s response identified\nas superior to the other. We selected the responses preferred by\nhumans to create a hypothetical \"ideal\" system, while the responses\nthat were less preferred were selected to build a \"worst-case\" sys-\ntem. Following this, we crafted synthetic CRS systems of varying\nquality by blending 90%, 80%, ..., 10% of the \"ideal\" system with\n10%, 20%, ..., 90% of the \"worst-case\" system. After the synthesis, we\ncompute each metric including Behavior Alignment to see if they\ncan effectively differentiate between different synthetic systems.\nAs displayed in Figure 3, the x-axis signifies the proportion of\nsamples taken from the \"ideal\" system, which can be interpreted as a\n\"human preference score\". The results show that there is a consistent\nincrease in Behavior Alignment which ranges from 0.11 to 0.88 as\nwe shift from a \"worst-case\" system to an \"ideal\" system. This rise\nis directly proportional to each incremental inclusion of human-\npreferred samples. However, the other two metrics, BLEU@K and\nDIST@K, exhibited minimal variability despite the enhancement\nin human-preferred samples.\n5 ESTIMATION OF IMPLICIT BEHAVIOR\nALIGNMENT\nAlthough the proposed Behavior Alignment is effective, it requires\nreal-time annotations of behavior types, which is not readily avail-\nable. To address this issue, we propose a classification-based method\nto estimate the implicit behavior alignment. Instead of directly pre-\ndicting the behavior categories and then comparing whether the\nbehaviors of two responses are the same, the method focuses on a\nbinary problem: predicting whether the two responses belong to\nthe same category, which would not require the explicit behavior\nlabels anymore1.\n5.1 Methodology\nGiven a human-generated response 𝐻 and a CRS-generated re-\nsponse 𝐶, we propose estimating the alignment through a binary\nclassifier, which takes 𝐻 and 𝐶 as input and predicts whether they\n1The source code and the experiments can be found at https://github.com/dayuyang1\n999/Behavior-Alignment\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Dayu Yang, Fumian Chen, & Hui Fang\nBehavior Type Accuracy 1st Misclassification 2nd Misclassification\npersonal experience 0.60 credibility similarity\nrephrase preference 0.45 preference confirmation personal opinion\nself modeling 0.31 personal experience similarity\nsimilarity 0.53 acknowledgment self modeling\ntransparency 0.65 opinion inquiry offer help\nTable 2: Top 1st and 2nd misclassification for those Behavior classes having accuracy lower than 0.7\nAccuracy on hold-out test set\nOriginal Mixed-hard\nFold0 0.960 0.976\nFold1 0.958 0.978\nFold2 0.958 0.977\nFold3 0.940 0.976\nFold4 0.967 0.973\nAveraged 0.957 0.976\nTable 3: Cross-validation results\ncorrespond to the same category or not. The binary classifier is\nbuilt based on BERT2 and fine-tuned on 100,000 human response\npairs selected from INSPIRED dataset. How to select the pairs? We\nexplore two strategies to construct the training/testing data.\nThe first training strategy is straightforward. We created 50,000\nnegative sentence pairs with different behavior types and another\n50,000 positive pairs with the same behavior type. For each sentence\npair, they are concatenated by a special token [SEP], which allows\nBERT to identify the segment of two sentences. This strategy is\nreferred to as \"Original\".\nThe second strategy is to intentionally include more difficult\nexamples in the training data to improve the robustness of the clas-\nsifier. To achieve this, we first train a multi-class classifier to predict\nthe exact behavior type of each sentence. The prediction results\nare compared with the ground truth labels in order to compute\nthe misclassification rate. Specifically, we define \"hard negatives\"\nas negative pairs that a sentence having a prediction accuracy of\nless than 0.7 and another sentence is from its most misclassified\ncategory as shown in Table 2. Consequently, we created 10,000 hard\nnegative samples across five categories. We then randomly replaced\n10,000 negative examples in the original training data with hard\nnegatives to build the \"mixed-hard\" training set.\n5.2 Evaluation\nThe robustness of a binary classifier is important, as it directly\ninfluences the efficacy and applicability of the proposed metric.\nTo assess the robustness, we employ three methodologies: (1) im-\nplementing cross-validation to ensure consistently high accuracy;\n(2) determining its Cohen’s Kappa in relation to human annota-\ntions to verify an invariably strong agreement; and (3) evaluating\nits performance on out-of-distribution data to ascertain minimal\nperformance degradation.\nFirst, we employ cross-validation on the binary sentence pairs.\nAs observed in Table 3, the accuracy remains consistently high\nregardless of which strategy is used for constructing training data.\nSecond, we utilized Cohen’s Kappa to quantify the agreement\nbetween the classifier’s predictions and human annotations. As\nillustrated in Table 4, our results depict that Cohen’s Kappa exceeds\n2https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased\nAccuracy Cohen’s kappa\nOriginal 0.957 0.913\nMixed-hard 0.976 0.952\nTable 4: The agreement between predictions and human an-\nnotations on testing samples\nAccuracy Cohen’s kappa\nOriginal 0.782 0.563\nMixed-hard 0.932 0.865\nTable 5: The agreement between predictions and human\nannotations on out-of-distribution instances from ReDial\ndataset\n0.9 on the testing set, denoting an almost impeccable alignment\nbetween the classifier’s predictions and human annotations.\nLastly, to verify the generalizability of the binary classifier, we\nselected another widely-used CRS dataset that the model has not\nseen during training, ReDial [12] for testing. Compared with IN-\nSPIRED dataset, ReDial dataset emphasizes more on making rec-\nommendations during chi-chat, rendering its linguistic style more\ncolloquial. The out-of-distribution samples that have differences\non using of language may introduce challenges to the classifier.\nGiven the absence of behavior annotation in the ReDial dataset,\nwe first instructed two annotators to annotate ReDial in a man-\nner similar to INSPIRED, resulting in 42006 sentence pairs with\nground-truth binary labels. As Table 5 showcases, the binary classi-\nfier trained on \"Original\" sentence pairs witnessed a marked decline\nin performance. Conversely, the classifier trained on sentence pairs\naugmented with hard negatives demonstrated superior generaliz-\nability, achieving over 93% accuracy and a Cohen’s kappa of 0.86\nwith humans. This generally indicates a near-perfect agreement\nbetween the automatic annotator and human recommenders. The\nfindings emphasize the importance of hard negatives, particularly\nfor a dataset-agnostic evaluation metric.\n6 CONCLUSION\nEvaluating the generated sentences is crucial for CRS as they sig-\nnificantly influence user responses. This, in turn, impacts both\ninformation exposure and user profiling. In this paper, we intro-\nduce a novel evaluation metric designed to assess the quality of\nresponses generated by LLM-based CRSs. Our experiments demon-\nstrate this metric’s effectiveness, particularly in its alignment with\nhuman preferences and its capacity to distinguish LLM-based CRSs\nby their ability to implement complex recommendation strategies.\n7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research is supported by the graduate fellowship from the Insti-\ntute for Financial Services Analytics at the University of Delaware.\nWe would also like to express our sincere gratitude to the reviewers\nfor their insightful comments and suggestions.\nBehavior Alignment: A New Perspective of Evaluating LLM-based Conversational Recommender Systems SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\nREFERENCES\n[1] Keqin Bao, Jizhi Zhang, Yang Zhang, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, and Xiangnan\nHe. 2023.
