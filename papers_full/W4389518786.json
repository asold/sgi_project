Cre-\nating awareness and educating policy makers\nthe wide-ranging impact of climate change is\nan essential step towards a sustainable future.\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) like\nChatGPT and Bard have shown impressive con-\nversational abilities and excel in a wide va-\nriety of NLP tasks. While these models are\nclose-source, recently alternative open-source\nLLMs such as Stanford Alpaca and Vicuna\nhave shown promising results. However, these\nopen-source models are not specifically tai-\nlored for climate related domain specific in-\nformation and also struggle to generate mean-\ningful responses in other languages such as,\nArabic. To this end, we propose a light-weight\nArabic Mini-ClimateGPT that is built on an\nopen-source LLM and is specifically fine-tuned\non a conversational-style instruction tuning cu-\nrated Arabic dataset Clima500-Instruct with\nover 500k instructions about climate change\nand sustainability.

Response: Climate change\nhas a significant impact on food security and freshwater. For example, high\ntemperatures can lead to crop loss, water scarcity, the spread of pests and\ndiseases, resulting in reduced agricultural production and increased food prices.\nAdditionally, high temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns can lead\nto a decline in the availability of freshwater, affecting agricultural production,\nenergy, and other industries that rely on irrigation methods.User:In this case,\nhow can we preserve the crops? Response:Crops can be preserved through\nvarious methods, which include using sustainable agricultural practices such\nas efficient irrigation techniques, crop diversification, and crop rotation. These\nefforts can help reduce reliance on traditional crops and enhance the resilience\nof agricultural systems to climate change. (best viewed in zoom)\nEducating people about climate change and sus-\ntainability is essential for preserving the environ-\nment, encouraging sustainable development, and\npreparing for future challenges. For improving\npublic awareness on climate change and sustain-\nability related issues, conversational agents and\nbots can play a vital role. Despite being spoken by\naround 422 million (Wikipedia contributors, 2023)\nspeakers worldwide, efforts towards developing\nclimate-specialized conversational agents in Ara-\nbic have been limited. In this work, we propose\na specialized conversational agent in Arabic fo-\ncused on climate change and sustainability aware-\nness. Such a specialized conversational agent can\nhave a wide range of applications. For instance, it\ncan be utilized to educate students about climate\nchange by generating relevant educational materi-\nals. Furthermore, environment policy makers can\nleverage such an agent to make well-informed and\nsustainable decisions.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) such\n14126\nكيف يؤثر الإنسان في البيئة ؟\nArabic Mini-ClimateGPT\nVicuna LLM fine-tuned on \nClima500-Instruct\nUser Query\nVector \nDatabase\nVector \nSimilarity Search\nEmbedding\nAugmented \nUser Query\nللانسان أثاا  كبيارف فاي تيئ،او س   سابب فاي \n غيرات في المناخ   اميير الغاتاات  ا نظماة \nالإيكولوجية ا خرى.  س،مر ا نشطة البشارية \nيثل حرق الوقاو  الفرارو  ال،ياميا  الع ا اة \nفااي لاقاالاق تاااحات ا ح،باااي الفاارا و س يمااا \nيؤ و لالى ا  راا    جاات الفارا ف   غيار نما \nالطقس  ا  را  يس،وى سطح البفار س  ال،اي \n ؤثر تم  ها  لى المناخ اليالمي.\nModel Response\nFigure 2: Overview of Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT framework: When the user submits a query, it is first embedded\nand searched for similarity in the vector database. The query is then augmented if the retrieved information is of\nhigh correspondence and passed on to our model for generating the final output.\nas ChatGPT(OpenAI, 2022) from OpenAI and\nBard(Google, 2023)from Google have demon-\nstrated excellent capabilities to behave like ver-\nsatile conversational agents and generate responses\nfor a wide range of tasks. However, it is impor-\ntant to note that Bard and ChatGPT models are\ncurrently not available as open-source, thereby lim-\niting access to their underlying architecture and im-\nplementation details. The recently introduced open-\nsource model Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) demon-\nstrates exceptional performance and achieves more\nthan 90% of ChatGPT’s quality on GPT-4 eval-\nuations. The model was created by fine-tuning\nLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and surpasses exist-\ning open-source competitors across various bench-\nmark evaluations. We base our climate-specialized\nconversational agent in Arabic, named Arabic Mini-\nClimateGPT on Vicuna.\nThe main contributions of this work are :\n(i) We propose a climate specialized Arabic con-\nversational agent named Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT,\nwhich is built upon Vicuna framework and fine-\ntuned specifically with our climate change and sus-\ntainability related instructions in Arabic language.\n(ii) We have generated over 500k conversational-\nstyle instruction tuning data based on the pub-\nlic benchmarks for climate change and sustain-\nability. This augmentation of interactive conver-\nsational data significantly enhances the perfor-\nmance of LLMs and preserves its generalizability\nthrough the fine-tuning process. To the best of\nour knowledge, our proposed dataset Clima500-\nInstruct marks the first release of a substantial\nconversational-style Arabic instruction set dedi-\ncated to Climate change and sustainability.\n(iii) We integrate a vector embedding and datastore\nframework, which can be utilized during model\ninference for information retrieval without the need\nfor additional training.\n(iv) We perform comprehensive evaluations of our\nmodel. Our model achieves 88.3% win rate in\nChatGPT-based comparison with baseline. Further-\nmore, our Arabic language expert evaluation shows\nthat our model responses were preferred in 81.6%\nof the cases, whereas popular open-sourced models\nsuch as Vicuna, Alpaca-Arabic and Dolly v2 were\nsuccessful only in less than 8% of the cases.\n2 Related Work\nClimateQ&A (Ekimetrics, 2023) is a ChatGPT\nbased tool that can distil climate science knowledge\nbased on IPCC reports and environment articles to\nuser friendly responses. Although this model is\navailable on HuggingFace, it is not open-sourced\nas it is dependent on ChatGPT. Moreover, its re-\nsponses are limited to English. ClimateBot (Rony\net al., 2022) is another machine reading compre-\nhension bot for Question Answering about climate\nchange documents. It is limited to localizing the\nanswer from a given context as it is based on a\nclustering approach and lacks the generative capa-\nbilities of modern LLMs. The model responses and\ndocument embeddings are limited to English. To\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to intro-\nduce an open-sourced, climate-specialized conver-\nsational agent in Arabic.\n2.1 Data Sources\nCCMRC: Climate Change dataset (Rony et al.,\n2022) is a climate and sustainability question-\nanswer dataset curated from trusted sources includ-\ning the official Semantic Scholar Dump, the IPCC\nReports, NASA Global Climate Change and indi-\nvidual documents. The dataset also includes news\narticles from several sources like CNN, National\nGeographic and The New York Times. The data\nwas pre-processed into 21K Question Answer pairs\nused for training and testing in our experiments.\nClimaBench: This is a benchmark dataset (Laud\net al., 2023) for Climate change text understand-\n14127\ning, which is built upon the publicly available sur-\nveys released by CDP (formerly the Carbon Dis-\nclosure Project (CDPInc, 2000)) and the NAIC\nClimate Risk Disclosure Survey. ClimaBench con-\nsists of Clima-Insurance and Clima-CDP for text\nclassification and Clima-QA for question answer-\ning tasks based on the CDP data. We use this\nClima-QA data compiled from the CDP-Cities,\nCDP-States and CDP-Corporation subsets and pre-\nprocess into 485K Question Answer (QA) pairs.\nThe proposed Arabic Clima500-Instruct dataset is\nbuilt upon CCMRC and ClimaBench datasets.\n3 Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT\nOur Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT is an open-sourced\nconversational agent instruction-tuned for Climate\nchange and Sustainability in Arabic. We first\ncreate a conversational style instruction-tuning\ndataset named Clima500-Instruct in Arabic lan-\nguage based on CCMRC and ClimaBench (See\nSec. 3.1). Our Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT is built\nupon the Vicuna-7B model by fine-tuning on the\nClima500-Instruct. We also integrate a dedicated\nInference module to incorporate region-specific\ndocuments in Arabic to extend the knowledge base\nof our model. (See Sec. 3.2)\n3.1 Arabic Clima500-Instruct Dataset\nWe propose a conversational style instruction-\ntuning dataset named Clima500-Instruct for Cli-\nmate change and Sustainability in Arabic language.\nDataset Creation:The existing climate-specific\ndatasets such as CCMRC and Clima-QA from\nClimaBench are naive QA datasets in English that\nlack the interactive conversation capabilities re-\nquired to train a conversational agent such as Vi-\ncuna. To this end, our proposed Clima500-Instruct\ndataset is a conversational-style instruction tuning\ndataset in Arabic language with Climate change\nand sustainability as the central theme. Fig. 3\nshows our overall dataset creation pipeline which\nis summarized below:\n(i) We first pre-process the data and extract the\nQuestion Answer (QA) pairs from their respective\nsources. These QA pairs are then compiled and\nconverted to a naive QA instruction set.\n(ii) We then instruct ChatGPT to act as a domain\nexpert in Climate change and sustainability to gen-\nerate conversational-style responses in English\ngrounded in information based on the QA pairs\nfrom CCMRC and ClimaBench.\nDataset Total\nInstances\nAvg.

Rather than resorting to rudi-\nmentary translation APIs, we employ the capabil-\nities of ChatGPT. We instruct ChatGPT to oper-\nate as an expert in the Arabic domain, translating\nboth the question and the answer within a single\nprompt, thereby facilitating improved contextual\nunderstanding by the model.\n(iv) Finally, wemanually filtered out low-quality ex-\namples and post-processed the instruction set with\nthe assistance of native Arabic experts. The fol-\nlowing steps were taken to post-process the dataset.\n(a) Eliminate undefined symbols. (b) Verify and\nmanually translate English words in several ques-\ntions and answers into Arabic. (c) Remove any in-\nstances of corrupted translation (Q or A still being\nin English). (d) Verify the translation for N random\nsamples. This approach enabled us to obtain a high-\nquality, conversationally-styled instruction tuning\ndataset, Clima500-Instruct, in the Arabic language.\nDataset Statistics:Table 1 summarizes the statis-\ntics of our proposed Clima500-Instruct dataset in\nArabic language as well as its intermediate byprod-\nuct in the English language. The train and test set\nsplits of our Clima500-Instruct dataset are carefully\nprepared based on the respective splits of represen-\ntative data sources mentioned in section 2.1. To\nfurther understand the composition of our proposed\nClima500-Instruct Dataset, we obtain high-level\ncategories in our dataset based on the most fre-\nquent words. Table 2 reports the categories and\ntheir corresponding instance counts.\n3.2 Model Training and Inference\nOur Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT is developed on top\nof the Vicuna-7B (Chiang et al., 2023) model. We\nfine-tune this Vicuna-7B model on the conversa-\ntional style Clima500-Instruct in both English and\nArabic languages. We train the model on 4 x A100\n(80GB) utilizing gradient checkpointing and flash\nattention following the Vicuna fine-tuning recipe.\nWe observe that the Arabic ClimateGPT model re-\nquires a context length of 1024 tokens to generate\nhigh quality results. The overall framework of our\nmodel with its inference time retrieval capabilities\nis shown in Fig. 2.\n14128\nClimaBench\nClimaQA\nCCMRC QA\nConvert to Conversational \nstyle instruction set\nCCMRC \nData Sources\nChatGPT\nPreprocess\nPreprocess\nTranslate to Arabic \nwith QA context\nChatGPT\nManual Filtering\nPostprocessing\nClima500\nInstruct\nFigure 3: Clima500-Instruct Arabic Dataset creation pipeline: At first, CCMRC and ClimaBench dataset are\npre-processed and compiled into QA pairs. These QA pairs are then converted to a conversational-style instruction\nset and further translated into Arabic using ChatGPT. The resulting instruction set undergoes manual verification\nand post-processing to yield the final Clima500-Instruct dataset.

However, their knowledge-\nbase is inherently limited to their training data. Re-\ncent frameworks (Chase, 2022) have shown that\nthe use of Vector embedding based retrieval mech-\nanisms can be leveraged to extend the knowledge\nbase of an LLM. To this end, we integrate a vector\ndatabase using the ChromaDB(Huber et al., 2020)\nframework. We use the stsb-xlm-r-multilingual\nmodel from Sentence Transformers (Reimers and\nGurevych, 2019) to embed the Arabic Climate doc-\numents to leverage its multilingual embedding ca-\npabilities. Climate reference documents in English\nare converted to vector embedding using the light-\nweight all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from Sentence Trans-\nformers (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019).\nThe inference steps of our model can be sum-\nmarized as the following. When a user submits\na query to the model it is first converted into the\nembedding space of the corresponding Sentence\nTransformer (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) based\non the language. We then perform a Vector sim-\nilarity search of this query embedding with the\nexisting Vector Database using ChromaDB. If the\nsimilarity search returns a high correspondence,\nthe user query is then augmented with the retrieved\nadditional context. If the retrieved documents are\nnot relevant then the original query is passed to\nthe Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT model. Our model\nfine-tuned on the Arabic Clima500-Instruct dataset,\nthen generates the final output by incorporating the\nsupplementary retrieved context (See Fig 2).\n4 Experiments\nAs LLMs become more sophisticated, the exist-\ning open benchmarks may no longer suffice to ad-\nequately assess their capabilities. These bench-\nmarks are typically designed to test chatbots on\na limited set of tasks, such as question-answering\nor context-based localization. To address this, we\ncompare the model responses with ground truth\nresponses on a held-out Clima500-Instruct Arabic\ntest set using ChatGPT. We compare the generated\nresponses of our model with other open-source\nLLMs like Vicuna(Chiang et al., 2023), Stanford\nAlpaca (Taori et al., 2023), Dolly v2 (Databricks,\n2023) and Arabic Alpaca(Yasbok, 2023) on the\ntest set. For each question within the test set, we\nprovided ChatGPT with the following inputs: (i)\nthe ground-truth answer text, (ii) the response texts\ngenerated by our model, and (iii) the text gener-\nated by the designated competitor model. In this\ncontext, ChatGPT’s role was to assess and contrast\nthe text outputs of our model and the competitor\nmodel, subsequently selecting the response that\nbest semantically aligns with the ground truth. If\nneither of the generated texts semantically matches\nthe ground truth, ChatGPT outputs \"Neither\" as the\nresponse. The row headers in Table 3 indicate the\n14129\noccurrences of \"Our,\" \"Competitor,\" and \"Neither\"\nbeing favored, alongside the corresponding win per-\ncentages. For instance, in the first row, our model\nis preferred in 88.33% of test samples, Vicuna is fa-\nvored in 11.23%, and in 0.43% of cases, neither our\nmodel nor Vicuna is preferred. Our Arabic Mini-\nClimateGPT model outperforms the recently intro-\nduced Vicuna with a win rate of 88.3% on ChatGPT\nevaluation. (See Tab 3). We also perform human\nexpert based evaluation on our Arabic Clima500-\nInstruct test set with native Arab speakers. For Hu-\nman Evaluation to be in a fair setting, we remove\nall model identifiers and provide responses from\nall 5 models to Arab native speakers. They then\nselect the best response out of the 5 (or none) for a\ngiven question. The evaluation results on recently\nintroduced open-source models are shown in Fig 4.\nOur Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT achieves an overall\nwin rate of 81.6% on human expert evaluations.\nTable 4 presents the comparison results of naive\ntranslated baselines with our proposed model.\nWe employ the same ChatGPT-based evaluation\nmethodology, comparing our proposed Arabic\nMini-ClimateGPT responses against these base-\nline models. (i) Vicuna_tr: In this baseline, we\nbegin by translating the query from Arabic to En-\nglish. Next, we generate the model response in\nEnglish using the Vicuna baseline. Finally, we\ntranslate the responses back to Arabic. (ii) Cli-\nmateGPT_en_tr: In the second baseline, we also\nexecute Arabic-English and English-Arabic trans-\nlations. However, instead of the Vicuna base-\nline, we utilize ClimateGPT_en. This model has\nbeen trained using the our proposed Clima500-\nInstruct in English. In both scenarios, we ob-\nserve that our Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT responses\noutperform these baselines. Our model achieves\n73.98% win rate compared to Vicuna_tr with only\n25.84%. In case of ClimateGPT_en_tr (30.07%),\nour model achieves 69.57% win rate on ChatGPT\nevaluations. These results demonstrate the neces-\nsity for a dedicated Arabic conversational dataset\nand model learning.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT,\na climate-specialized conversational agent in Ara-\nbic.

We open-\nsource our model weights and instruction set and\nwe hope that our work helps advance the commu-\nnity towards a sustainable future.\n6 Limitations\nOur model is developed upon Vicuna, a model\nbased on the LLaMA architecture. The LLaMA\nmodel has been trained on a range of data sources,\nsuch as CommonCrawl, C4, and Wikipedia. It\nshould be noted that these sources may contain\ninaccurate information. The model also could\nbe tuned to show racial biases by modifying the\nprompt, a potential limitation that users should\nbe aware of. Furthermore, our model can some-\ntimes generate unrealistic or ’hallucinated’ re-\nsponses when conversations exceed the maximum\n14130\ncontext length. Examples of failure cases are\nshown in Appendix A.\nCurrently, our Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT is lim-\nited to the language domain and cannot incorporate\nvisual data. Recently introduced Large Language-\nVision Models (LLVMs) (Zhu et al., 2023; Liu\net al., 2023; Thawkar et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023;\nMuhammad Maaz and Khan, 2023) have demon-\nstrated promising results in several domains. We\nhope that integrating a dedicated Vision encoder\nfor Climate related modalities (e.g. temperature,\nwind, precipitation) with our model would be a\npromising future direction.\n7 Ethics Statement\nIn alignment with the ACL Ethics Policy, we ad-\ndress the ethical dimensions of our work on Ara-\nbic Mini-ClimateGPT. We have conscientiously\ncredited the data sources and other open source\nworks on which Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT is built\nupon.

The responses generated by\nour model are more coherent and factual compared\nto Vicuna. Please refer Fig 5 - 7 for more details.\nA.2 Examples of Failure Cases\nSince our model is a domain fine-tuned LLM, its\ncapabilities are limited to the Climate change and\nsustainability domain. In Example A (Fig 8) we\ncan see that the model cannot handle out of domain\nquestions. In Example B (Fig 9) we can see that the\nmodel is susceptible to Prompt hacking. In both\ncases, the model gives a generic response without\naddressing the query.\n14132\nFigure 5: Example 1 - QuestionWhat are the expected effects of climate change in the short and long term? Ours\nThe projected impacts of climate change will be on a very large and complex scale, and could affect different levels\nof ecosystems and human societies. These effects can include increased frequency and severity of natural disasters\nsuch as hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires. This can lead to loss of life and property, displacement of\ncommunities and damage to infrastructure. In addition, climate change can affect ecosystems, biodiversity and\nnatural resources such as forests, oceans and soils. This can lead to species extinction, altered reproduction and\nmigration patterns, and altered nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Moreover, climate change can have far-reaching\nimpacts on economic and social systems, including rising sea levels, altered rainfall patterns and loss of agricultural\nyields. These impacts can have significant economic, social and environmental consequences, including food\ninsecurity, social instability and loss of cultural diversity. In general, the impacts of climate change in the short\nand long term are complex and multifaceted, and the frequency and intensity of impacts will vary depending on the\nregion and ecosystem involved and the adaptive and mitigation capacity of human societies.Vicuna The impact of\nclimate change in the short and long term through changes in the basic weather and atmospheric waves such as the\nmiddle door and the east, and land changes in the areas where the weather waves change. Egyptian consultant\nSari Hakimi points out that climate change in the near term could lead to the destruction of different land areas,\nand the formation of lands in areas that recede with the changes of weather waves. We could also see changes\nin the atmospheric climate in the near term, which could lead to the destruction of people’s living environments\nrelated to the lands. A local community sometimes faces major challenges in weathering atmospheric and remote\nchanges, but in quite a few ways a community can combat its challenges in a multi-way, including investing in\nquality ground services, courses and training. Good luck, I can go into more detail on this topic, and try to provide\nmore information and ideas on this topic in the future.\n14133\nFigure 6: Example 2 - QuestionWhat is the difference between global warming and climate change? Ours Global\nwarming refers to the long-term increase in the Earth’s average surface temperature as a result of human activities\nsuch as burning fossil fuels, logging, and industrial processes. This leads to changes in global climate patterns, such\nas more frequent heat waves, droughts, floods and disasters. On the other hand, climate change refers to long-term\nchanges in weather patterns, temperatures, and precipitation as a result of natural changes in the terrestrial climate\nover time that can also lead to changes in climate patterns. Examples of natural climate changes include global\nand regional fluctuations, which can lead to droughts, floods, storms, temperature changes, and other weather\nphenomena that occur over long periods of time. Ultimately, the difference between global warming and climate\nchange is that human activities contribute significantly to the global warming that leads to climate change. It\nis important to take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the negative impacts of climate\nchange.Vicuna Global warming is one of the determinants that affect the atmospheric and chemical reactions in\nthe living family, including atmospheric and chemical changes appropriate to affinity and responses, in addition\nto changes in atmospheric waves and priority. Climate change is one of the determining factors affecting the\natmospheric and chemical reactions in the living family, including ion and isotropic changes, in addition to changes\nin atmospheric waves and priority. Global warming is a good challenge for the living family, as it is related to a\nlarge prevalence of human diseases and many unstable factors that affect the atmospheric and chemical reactions in\nthe living family, including changes in air waves and priority. Climate change is a good challenge for the living\nfamily, as it is related to a large prevalence of human diseases and many unstable factors that affect the atmospheric\nand chemical reactions in the living family, including changes in weather waves and priority. It considers some of\nthe specific factors that affect atmospheric and chemical reactions in the living family, such as global warming and\nclimate change, in addition to changes in air waves and priority, and in case the audience is exposed to them, they\ncan talk about them. They can keep track of the latest information about climate change and global warming and\nwhat’s your type, to get help with solutions for diseases and conditions\n14134\nFigure 7: Example 3 - QuestionHow can we tackle climate change? Ours Steps can be taken to address climate\nchange by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable energy and transportation practices.\nGovernments, businesses and individuals must collaborate to develop and implement policies and practices that\npromote sustainability and reduce the effects of climate change. Individuals can also take individual steps such as\nreducing energy consumption, installing energy-saving appliances, and load neutralization. In addition, climate\nchange can be promoted through research and studies to understand the factors contributing to it and implement\nsolutions to deal with it. The public can also contribute to climate change mitigation by changing individual\nbehavior and by engaging in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainability. Sharing\ninformation about climate change and potential solutions to address it can help increase awareness and education\nabout this critical issue. Ultimately, tackling climate change will require a combined effort from governments,\nbusinesses and individuals at all levels of society. Vicuna Yes, everything can address climate change, and it is\nimportant to address climate change is to address the change of the natural balance of regions. This can be done in\ndifferent ways, including anti-destruction, anti-land, anti-water and anti-land and body. Tackling climate change is\ncertainly an important part of the ecological nourishment of societies, and can be addressed through coordinated\nenvironmental planning and collaboration with ecological foods and harmonious agriculture. If you know what the\nclimate response is, you can benefit from the new standards and tools you use to address climate change to achieve\nsustainable development and the environment.\n14135\nFigure 8: Example A - UserWrite a python program to add two numbers Response Combine the two numbers to\ntake advantage of online energy efficiency improvements and environmentally significant actions. 2.
