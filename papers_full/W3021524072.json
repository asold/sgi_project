To study this,\nwe introduce a novel probing task with a di-\nagnostic dataset, N UMER SENSE 1, containing\n13.6k masked-word-prediction probes (10.5k\nfor ﬁne-tuning and 3.1k for testing).

Given PTLMs’ cited ability to\ncreate general, yet useful text representations, an in-\nvestigation of their ability to encode commonsense\nknowledge into representations is warrantedcom-\nmonsense knowledge is often required to have a\nfull understanding of language.\nRecently there have been a few recent works\nthat do investigate the inquiry of whether PTLMs\npossess commonsense knowledge (Petroni et al.,\n2019; Davison et al., 2019; Bouraoui et al., 2020).\nOverall, these prior studies suggest that PTLMs are\n1https://inklab.usc.edu/NumerSense/\n1st:fly(79.5%)2nd:sing(9.1%)\n1st:four(44.8%)2nd:two(18.7%)\nBirdscan[MASK].\nAbirdusuallyhas[MASK]legs.Acarusuallyhas[MASK]wheels.Acarusuallyhas[MASK]roundwheels.\nHowever,forNumericalCommonsenseKnowledge:\n1st:four(53.7%)2nd:two(20.5%)1st:two(37.1%)2nd:four(20.2%)\nBERT-LargeMaskedWordPrediction\nFigure 1: Top: PTLMs often cannot solve masked language\nmodeling tasks needing numerical commonsense knowledge,\nhence our title. Bottom: Even when PTLMs seemingly suc-\nceed, they fail to stay consistent under small perturbations.\ncreating text representations that often have com-\nmonsense knowledge encoded in them. We, how-\never, ﬁnd it surprising that when posed with a simi-\nlar reasoning-based masked-word-prediction task,\nPTLMs perform poorly in recalling the required\nnumerical commonsense knowledge (see Figure 1).\nTherefore, in this paper, our goal is to study\nwhether PTLMs capture numerical commonsense\nknowledge, i.e., commonsense knowledge that pro-\nvides an understanding of the numeric relation be-\ntween entities. We propose measuring this capa-\nbility via a masked-word-prediction based probing\ntask, where, the ranking of numeric words by what\nthe model believes most probably ﬁlls the mask\nwould expose the capabilities of PTLMs to capture\nnumeric commonsense knowledge. For example,\nthe masked position in the sentence “A bird usually\nhas [MASK] legs.” is best ﬁlled by the number\n“two” when considering only numerical words.\nAround this concept, we built a carefully crafted\ndataset, NUMER SENSE , of 3,145 probes that covers\nquestions from 8 different categories such as every-\nday objects, biology, geometry, etc. In our initial\nexperiments, we ﬁnd PTLMs to be brittle against\nadversarial attacks. As shown in the bottom sec-\ntion of Figure 1, BERT initially correctly predicts\nthe masked word to be “four”, but it changes its\ntop result to “two” in the slightly perturbed second\narXiv:2005.00683v2  [cs.CL]  18 Sep 2020\nsentence (a simple insertion of the word ‘round’).\nThus, we intentionally included adversarial exam-\nples in the probes to test the robustness.\nWe evaluate PTLMs in two settings (Section 3):\n(1) a zero-shot setting, meaning no probes from our\ndataset were used to ﬁne-tune the models before\nevaluation; (2) a distant supervision setting, where\nmodels were ﬁne-tuned on examples from related\ncommonsense reasoning datasets before being eval-\nuated on ours. Our ﬁndings reveal that PTLMs are\nstill much worse than humans on the task, although\nﬁne-tuning with distant supervision can help. We\nalso provide some cursory analysis on why PTLMs\nperhaps preform so poorly, pointing to interesting\nfuture research. We also hope our work can ben-\neﬁt future works in: 1) improving PTLMs’ abili-\nties to faithfully capture (numerical) commonsense,\n2) populating numerical facts in current common-\nsense knowledge bases, and 3) open-domain QA\n“Q: How many legs do ants have?” “A: Six! ”\n2 The N UMER SENSE Probing Task\nWe introduce our numerical commonsense reason-\ning probing task, as well as the creation process of\nthe namesake dataset, NUMER SENSE . Then, we\nprovide a breakdown of what types of knowledge\nare covered by the probes and ﬁnally include ad-\nditional high-quality distant supervision to test if\nﬁne-tuning can improve performance.\n2.1 Task Formulation\nWe essentially probe PTLMs with the distribution\nof words a PTLM thinks could ﬁll the masked po-\nsition, by ranking their softmax scores (greatest to\nleast). If the ranking demonstrates numerical com-\nmonsense knowledgethe highest ranked number\nword (e.g., “one”, “two”, and so on) is the correct\nanswerthen that probe is successfully completed by\nthe PTLM. The masked position in each probe is\nchosen such that a number word is an extremely\nprobable way of ﬁlling in the blank.\n2.2 Probing Data Collection\nTo build a suitable dataset for the proposed probing\ntask, we make use of an existing corpus consisting\nof commonsense assertions, named Open Mind\nCommon Sense (OMCS) (Singh et al., 2002). We\nﬁrst extracted the sentences from OMCS that had\nat least one of the following 12 number words:\nCategoryExampleObjects(35.2%)Abicycle has twotires. Biology(13.5%)Ants havesixlegs.Geometry(11.7%)Acube has sixfaces.Unit(6.3%)Therearesevendaysinaweek.Math(7.3%)Iwillbetennextyear,asIamninenow.Physics(5.7%)Water will freeze at zerodegrees centigrade.Geography(2.9%)The world contains sevencontinents.Misc.(17.5%)There arenoprinces in the United States.\nTable 1: NUMER SENSE examples of each category.\n{“no”2, “zero”, “one”, “two”, ..., “ten”}.\nHowever, as to be expected, there were many\nnoisy statements which were either 1) incorrect, 2)\ncontaining typos, or 3) having no numerical com-\nmonsense logic. We thus manually and pragmati-\ncally reﬁned these sentences and did two rounds of\nvetting by different graduate students, from which\nwe only kept the statements that were accepted by\nall annotators. After this strict ﬁltration process,\nwe ended up 1,131 cleaned statements for probing.\nWe did an initial test and observed that PTLMs\ncan be brittle under a simple perturbation of insert-\ning an adjective near the masked number word.\nThus, in order to study the robustness of mod-\nels in our proposed task, we also added adver-\nsarial examples to our dataset by adding adjec-\ntives before the noun involved in the numerical\nreasoning in each probe. The candidate adjec-\ntives are generated by querying relevant triples (e.g.\n<wheel, HasProperty, round> for the ex-\nample in Fig. 1) in the commonsense knowledge\ngraph, ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), and fur-\nther selected or modiﬁed by human annotators to\nassure adversarial examples are still valid and nat-\nural. We ﬁnally have 3,145 testing probes for NU-\nMER SENSE as the diagnostic dataset.\nWe also manually annotated the category label\nfor each instance so that we can better understand\nthe covered topics and their percentage. We found 8\ntypes of numerical commonsense knowledge rang-\ning from tangible everyday objects (e.g., car, guitar,\nand table) to geometry (e.g., cube). Table 1 lists\nsome concrete examples of each category.\n2.3 Supervision for Fine-Tuning PTLMs\nOne may wonder if ﬁne-tuning towards this task\ncould improve the performance. In order to an-\n2 We include “no”, as there exists statements involving\nnumerical commonsense knowledge, where “no” is used in\nplace of zero, “There are no princes in the United States.”\nswer this question, we further collected training\nsentences from the GenericsKB corpus (Bhaktha-\nvatsalam et al., 2020). The sentences in Generic-\nsKB are generic commonsense statements that are\nextracted from Simple Wikipedia, Common Crawl\nwithin educational domains, ARC corpus, etc.\nWe collected these sentences by ﬁrst obtaining a\nlist of frequent nouns from various caption cor-\npora such as MSCOCO (Lin et al., 2014) and\nV ATEX (Wang et al., 2019). Then, we selected\ncollected sentences contained at least one number\nword of interest and ﬁnally go through the same hu-\nman annotator veriﬁcation process as the test data.\nWe ended up collecting 10,492 sentences for ﬁne-\ntuning and believe these sentences, if used properly,\ncan improve PTLMs’ ability to recall the numerical\ncommonsense knowledge.\n2.4 Statistics of NUMER SENSE\nWe show the distribution of the truth number words\nin the training data, test data in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.\nThe average length of the sentence in training data\nis 11.1 and it is 8.9 in test data.\nFigure 2: Truth number distribution of the training set.\nFigure 3: Truth number distribution of the test set.\nCore Probes + Adversarial Examples\nModels hit@1hit@2hit@3hit@1hit@2 hit@3\nGPT-2 29.86 50.88 67.49 24.73 44.21 62.30\nBERT-Base31.98 55.92 70.58 25.24 48.66 64.81\nRoBERTa-Base36.04 60.42 72.08 28.39 51.91 67.29\nBERT-Large37.63 62.01 76.77 27.18 52.89 70.22\nRoBERTa-Large45.85 66.70 80.04 35.66 58.52 74.44\nFt.

We will also provide some analysis on\nthe robustness and biases in the various models,\nand ﬁnally a study of the performance of a state-of-\nthe-art open-domain question-answering model.\n3.1 Experiment Set-up\nWe run our experiments in two settings, zero-\nshot inference and additional supervision via ﬁne-\ntuning. In the ﬁrst setting, we probe PTLMs\nwithout any modiﬁcations, speciﬁcally we use\nBERT and RoBERTa with pre-trained masked-\nword-prediction heads.\nIn our second setting, we use our collected addi-\ntional supervision dataset (Sec. 2.3) and mask the\nnumber words in each sentence. We then proceed\nto ﬁne tune the models above on these masked sen-\ntences, before evaluating them on NUMER SENSE .\n3.2 Evaluation Metric and Human Bound\nA masked-word-prediction head (either ﬁne-tuned\nor not) produces a probability distribution over its\nwhole vocabulary via a softax layer. As mentioned\nin Sec. 2.1, NUMER SENSE is the task of using this\nprobability distribution to rank all number words,\nand evaluating this ranking. To evaluate, we use\nhit@1/2/3 accuracy, which calculates the percent-\nage of predictions where the correct number word\nis ranked in the top knumber words.3\nTo estimate human performance on the task, we\nsampled 300 examples and asked two groups of\nthree people to ﬁll in the masked word, where one\n3We also report the performance of GPT-2 by iteratively\nﬁlling the masked word and rank with their perplexity.\nTable 1\nCategory RoBERTa-L Human (closed-\nbook)\nObjects 46.78 93.88\nBiology 41.06 85.71\nGeometry 33.08 97.14\nUnit 26.39 88.89\nMath 43.37 94.44\nPhysics 27.69 73.68\nGeography 36.36 60.00\nMisc. 44.72 81.82\nCommmon Obj.\nBiology\nGeometry\nUnit\nMath\nPhy. & Ast.\nGeography\nMisc.\nCategory\nObjects\nBiology\nGeometryUnit\nMath\nPhysics\nGeographyMisc.0.00 25.00 50.00 75.00\n81.82\n60.00\n73.68\n88.89\n85.71\n44.72\n36.36\n27.69\n43.37\n26.39\n33.08\n41.06\n46.78\nRoBERTa-L Human (closed-book)\nObjects\nBiology\nGeometry\nUnit\nMath\nPhysics\nGeography\nMisc.\n0.00 25.00 50.00 75.00 100.00\n81.82\n60.00\n73.68\n94.44\n88.89\n97.14\n85.71\n93.88\n44.72\n36.36\n27.69\n43.37\n26.39\n33.08\n41.06\n46.78\nRoBERTa-L Human (closed-book)\n1\nFigure 4: Performance of RoBERTa-Large V .S. human\nperformance (closed-book tests) on different categories\nof numerical commonsense knowledge.\ngroup had access to external information ( open-\nbook test) from the Web such as Wikipedia and\nthe other did not (closed-book test). We take the\nmajority label as the ﬁnal human label.\n3.3 Experimental results\nWe show our experimental results in Table 2. The\nﬁrst four lines are results from PTLMs in the zero-\nshot inference setting. We see that size matters, as\nthere is a clear performance gain when the model\nsizes increases. Also, RoBERTa’s results are con-\nsistently better than BERT’s, which is probably\nbecause RoBERTa uses a larger training corpora\nand focuses more on masked language modeling in\nits pre-training stage.\nWe see that our ﬁne-tuning efforts do help im-\nprove model performance: “ 37.63 → 50.00” for\nBERT-large and “45.85 → 54.06” for RoBERTa-\nlarge. However, both are still far from the human’s\nclosed-book evaluation. Figure 4 shows PTLMs\nperformance is poor across all categories within the\ncore set of NUMER SENSE .\nComparing the performance of a PTLM on the\n“Core Probes” set (#=1,131) versus the “+ Adver-\nsarial Examples” set (#=3,145), we can measure\ntheir robustness. We found all models incur a sig-\nniﬁcant performance drop when being evaluated\non the adversarial set. This suggests that PTLMs\n(even when ﬁne-tuned) can be brittle towards adver-\nsarial attacks, and future direction in pre-training\nlanguage models should consider more structured\ninductive biases such as dependencies and semantic\nroles when learning contextual representations.\n4 Case Studies\nObject bias. Recall the example “a bird usually\nhas [MASK] legs,” which BERT-Large predicts to\nbe “four”. Does BERT-Large always predict “four”\nas long as the adjacent word after the [MASK] is\n‘legs’? To investigate if the bias exists, we show\nsome case studies in Table 3. As 1,000 different\nrandomly generated words ﬁll the ‘[x]’s we see\nthat both BERT and RoBERTa have a bias towards\na certain answer, evidenced by the existence of a\ndominant answer in the softmax distribution. How-\never, it seems that RoBERTa’s (Liu et al., 2019)\nmodiﬁed pre-training strategy helps it have less\nbias. We argue that future studies should further\ncontrol the bias in masked language modeling.\nAttention distribution. Following the prior prob-\ning work (Clark et al., 2019) on the relationship\nbetween attention weights and syntactic structures,\nwe plot the attention distribution of the sentence\n“A bird usually has two legs.” with respect to the\nword ‘two’ in Figure 5. We ﬁnd that the root word\n‘has’ enjoys the maximum attention at in the ﬁrst\nfew and middle layers, while the word ‘two’ gets\nthe maximum attention to itself in the end. The\nimportant words for querying the numerical com-\nmonsense, namely ‘birds’ and ‘legs’, always have\nlow attention weights. This suggests that the BERT\n(and RoBERTa) may inherently lose the relation-\nship between subject/object and number words.\n5 Open-Domain ‘How-Many’ Questions\nThe examples in the NUMER SENSE can be also\nseen as open-domain questions targeting ‘how-\nmany’ commonsense“how many legs does a ﬂy usu-\nally have?” Answering these open-domain numer-\nical commonsense questions is a practical down-\nstream application of models that are successful\nin the NUMER SENSE . Thus, as a side note, we\nalso report the performance of the state-of-the-art\nopen-domain QA model (Asai et al., 2020).\nWe use the model that is trained on the Natural\nQuestion (NQ) dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019),\nwhere we replace the ‘[MASK]’s in our examples\nwith ‘how many’, so that our probes are in a sim-\nilar format to NQ examples. For example “a ﬂy\nusually has [MASK] legs” is converted to “ how\nmany legs a ﬂy usually has?”4 The accuracy of the\nstate-of-the-art model is only15.4%, which is even\nlower than using BERT-base without ﬁne-tuning.\nThis indicates that improving performance on NU-\nMER SENSE can help improve the performance on\nanswering open-domain “how-many” questions.\n4We also manually test some queries such as “how many\nlegs does a ﬂy usually have?”, which have similar results.\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1 13 25 37 49 61 73 85 97 109 121 133\nA\nbird\nusually\nhas\ntwo\nlegs\n.\nFigure 5: The attention distribution of the sentence “A bird usually has two legs.” on RoBERTa-base.

Clark et al. (2019)\ninvestigated the relationship between BERT’s atten-\ntion weights and syntactic structures, while such as\ndependency (e.g. direct objects, noun modiﬁers),\ncoreference, and sentence segmentation. Tenney\net al. (2019) was able to display where certain\ntypes of linguistic information is captured within\nBERTthey in fact ﬁnd the layers in a PTLM rep-\nresent the steps of a classical NLP pipeline: POS\ntagging, parsing, NER, semantic roles, and coref-\nerence. This line of work has indeed helped us\nunderstand the ability of PTLMs to capture linguis-\ntic knowledge via self-supervised learning from\nunlabeled data. We are interested in the numerical\ncommonsense knowledge of PTLMs.\nProbing Commonsense Knowledge.Besides the\nworks that we have discussed in Section 1, Zhou\net al. (2020) and Talmor et al. (2019a) also pro-\nposed to probe the commonsense knowledge of pre-\ntrained language models, following the prior work\nby Trinh and Le (2018a and 2018b). They both\nutilized various existing language understanding\ndatasets targeting commonsense knowledge to test\nif PTLMs can capture certain commonsense knowl-\nedge. Lin et al. (2019a) also show that PTLMs\ncan retrieve paths from ConceptNet that aid in in-\nterpreting the decision made by the PTLMs on the\nCommonsenseQA dataset (Talmor et al., 2019b).\nLin et al. (2019b) probe the commonsense knowl-\nedge in pre-trained language generation models via\na constrained text generation task. However, they\ndo not consider numerical commonsense knowl-\nedge, which is relatively under-explored area.\nNumerical Commonsense Knowledge. Forbes\nand Choi (2017) and Goel et al. (2019) studied\ncommonsense comparisons between two physi-\ncal objects (e.g., a house is usually bigger than\na person) in pre-trained word embeddings. Elazar\net al. (2019) and Yamane et al. (2020) propose to\ninduce the commonsense distribution of quantita-\ntive attributes (e.g., mass, length, and currency) of\nobjects. Their goal is to extract or crowd-source\nsuch numerical attributes, and then obtain distribu-\ntions that reﬂect commonsense knowledge. NU-\nMER SENSE , however, mainly focuses on exact nu-\nmerical commonsense facts (e.g., a bird has two\nlegs) instead of a range of values (e.g., a tiger\nweighs around 120kg), and have a larger number\nof arguments besides physical attributes.\nEncoding Numerics for Computation.Wallace\net al. (2019) probe PTLMs in terms of the abil-\nity to represent numeracy tokens by a regression\ntask (e.g., “71”→ 71.0), and also ﬁnd that BERT\nis not good at encoding numerical tokens. Some\nworks focus on incorporate algebra computation\nability in PTLMs (Zou and Lu, 2019; Geva et al.,\n2020), thus making them able to answer math rea-\nsoning tasks such as MAWPS (Koncel-Kedziorski\net al., 2016) and DROP (Dua et al., 2019). Note\nthat these models and tasks are not targeting nu-\nmerical commonsense knowledge but mainly the\nnumerical-related computation within text.\n7 Conclusion\nWe present a probing task, NUMER SENSE , to in-\nduce numerical commonsense knowledge from pre-\ntrained language models. We collect a new diag-\nnostic dataset carefully veriﬁed by human anno-\ntators, which covers 8 different topics. Powerful\npre-trained models such as BERT and RoBERTa\nperform surprisingly poorly, even after ﬁne-tuning\nwith high-quality distant supervision. We hope our\nﬁndings and probing dataset will provide a basis\nfor improving pre-trained masked language mod-\nels’ numerical and other concrete types of com-\nmonsense knowledge.\nReferences\nAkari Asai, Kazuma Hashimoto, Hannaneh Hajishirzi,\nRichard Socher, and Caiming Xiong. 2020.
