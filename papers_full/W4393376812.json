Here, we employed a\ngeneralized large language model to capture the dynamics of wildﬁre research published between\n1980 and 2022. More than 60,000 peer-reviewed papers were scanned and analyzed. Through\nintegrating geographical metadata extracted by the artiﬁcial intelligence and satellite wildﬁre datasets,\nwe found large disparities in geographic patterns and research themes. The hottest spot of wildﬁre\nresearch is western United States, accounting for 15% of publications but only 0.5% of global burnt\narea, while the world’s most widely burnt region, like Siberia and Africa are largely underrepresented by\ncontemporary publications. Similar discrepancies are found between the fuel of wildﬁre and its ignition\nand climatic drivers, between socioeconomic development and wildﬁre mitigation, raising concerns\non sustainable wildﬁre managements and calling for further artiﬁcial intelligence-aided\ntransdisciplinary collaborations.\nThe escalating severity and frequency of wildﬁres and the risks they pose to\necosystems and society have stimulated a rising interest in wildﬁre research.\nIndeed, a search of the Web of Science (WOS) bibliographic database using\nwildﬁre-related keywords returned over 100,000 papers (see Methods).\nMore notably, the number of publications per year has surged by more than\nfourfold in the last two decades (Fig.1). This rapid growth in wildﬁre\nresearch has been contributed by an interdisciplinary community. However,\ncommunications across disciplines remain limited, raising the question of\nh o wr e s e a r c ho nt h i st o p i ci sd i s t r i b u t e da c r o s sv a r i o u sa s p e c t so fw i l dﬁre\nresearch and geographical regions. Addressing this issue is crucial for\nidentifying research gaps and informing future research priorities.\nOn the other hand, the growing volume of literature also poses grand\nchallenges for literature reanalysis that aims to recap knowledge consensus\nand identify research gaps. Traditional expert-based methods, such as lit-\nerature reviews and meta-analyses\n1– 3, are often constrained to a limited\nnumber of publications, typically a few hundred. More recently, artiﬁcial\nintelligence (AI)-based approaches, including deep-learning methods,\ndevelop the capacity for analyzing large volumes of literature, offering a\nsolution to bridge the gap between the exponentially increasing number of\npublications and the ability to effectively synthesize them\n4. In particular, the\nrapid growth in the size of Large Language Models (LLMs)5– 7 have enabled\nend-users to perform a variety of complex tasks beyond semantic analyses8,\nmaking it a potentially powerful tool for overcoming the limitations of\ntraditional literature analyses. These LLMs, represented by ChatGPT, are\nknown for substantially large corpus in their training stages and capable for\ngeneral tasks, providing the conﬁdence in completing tasks such as textual\ngeographical entity recognition. Furthermore, these models have demon-\nstrated unprecedented“emergent abilities”, even reaching human-level\nperformance in various complex tasks\n9– 11.\nHere, we designed a literature analysis workﬂow (Supplementary\nFig. 1) to disentangle thematic andregional patterns in recent wildﬁre\nresearch with gpt-3.5-turbo (updated on 13th Feb 2023), the same LLM\nmodel underlying the public versionof ChatGPT. The model has already\nbeen proved to function effectively even withoutﬁne-tune, making it more\nconvenient for the initial information extraction and classiﬁcation pro-\ncesses. A recent study also showed comparable or even better performance\nin ChatGPT than conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nmethod (e.g., BERT) models especially on inference and question-\nanswering tasks\n12.W eu s e dt h eL L Mt oﬁrst categorize the collected pub-\nlications into different themes related to various aspects of wildﬁre research,\nincluding its causes, consequences, and the methodologies used to detect or\nsimulate wildﬁre dynamics (see Methods).

Ultimately, we were able to include\n60,488 relevant articles for subsequent analysis (see Methods for paper\ninclusion criteria). We focused on addressing the following questions: (1)\nWhat prevailing preferences and trends have emerged in wildﬁre research\nover recent decades? (2) How do spatio-temporal variations in research\nparadigms manifest? (3) What are the real-world implications of disparities\nin research of wildﬁre components and actual wildﬁre activities for popu-\nlations and socioeconomic development?\nResults\nAmong all the keywords associated with wildﬁre research, “vegetation”\nemerged as the most frequently discussed, accounting for 47% of the papers.\nWithin the“vegetation” category, forestﬁres attracted the most attention\n(72%; Fig.1). There was also a large volume of wildﬁre studies involving\n“anthropogenic,”“ atmospheric,” and “modeling” aspects.\nFrom a temporal evolutionary perspective, the recent rapid increase in\nthe overall number of wildﬁre publications (Fig.2a) is comparable to other\ntrending key words such as climate change4.F u r t h e r m o r e ,w ea l s oo b s e r v e d\ndistinct shifts in topics that have experienced the most rapid growth since\n1990s (Fig.2a). For instance, when comparing research preferences in the\n2000s to that in the 1990s, we found that discussions on the“hydrological”\nand “atmospheric” impacts of wildﬁres were among the fastest-growing\ntopics. Since the turn of the century, the widespread adoption of advanced\nsatellite-based instrumentation and retrieval/analysis algorithms, exempli-\nﬁed by the deployment of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-\nradiometer (MODIS), has catalyzed increased scholarly interest in“remote\nsensing” themes13. Similar shifts have been observed in the most recent\ndecade, during which the domains of“climate change” and“anthropogenic”\ninﬂuences have gained prominence in wildﬁre research4.\nUsing the LLM to extract and parse geolocation information from the\ntexts (see Methods), we were able to map published papers according to\ntheir focused regions (Fig.2b). An analysis of afﬁliations of full authors’lists\nof selected papers uncovered a consistent pattern that countries with higher\nlevels of development dominate the research landscape. Speciﬁcally, 87.1%\nof the total research contributions come from the leading 20 countries by\npublication count, with more than half of them classiﬁed as high-income\neconomies (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, 517 (70.4%) of the 732\npapers dedicated to wildﬁre datasets were contributed from high-income\ncountries, while less than 10% originated from lower-middle income\ncountries. Clearly, such publication biases in wildﬁre research papers and\ndatasets were primarily due to resource inequality (e.g., funding to conduct\nresearch, generate and maintain databases) between developed and devel-\noping countries. Inadequate funding could largely hamper the investment in\nFig. 2 | Spatio-temporal patterns of geoparsed\ndocuments. aGrowth in the number of wildﬁre\npublications.

For instance, while the burned area in the western\nUnited States accounts for less than 0.5% of the global burned area over the\npast two decades, this region emerged as a primary global research hotspot\nfor wildﬁre, accounting for 15.0% of the total published papers. Other well-\nknown wildﬁre-prone regions, including Canada, the Amazon, Australia,\nMediterranean regions, northern India, and northeast/south China, also\nreceived substantial attention, each being the subject of more than one\nthousand papers (Fig.2a). On the other hand, despite accounting for more\nthan 1.3% of global burned area and 4% of globalﬁre emissions, vast Siberia\nhas been largely underrepresented in the current literature\n16. Using the ratio\nof publication rates to the observed burned areas orﬁre emissions as indi-\ncators, it is evident that the African continent also emerges as a major\nunderstudied region (Fig.3 and Supplementary Fig. 2).\nAt the biome level, our analyses reveal a large disparity in research\nattention and the actual occurrence and impact of wildﬁres in grasslands\nand savannas in Africa and northern Australia (Fig.3). Despite constituting\njust 8% of the global population, theseb i o m e sb e a rt h eb u r d e no f7 2 %o ft h e\nglobal total burned area. In contrast, 14% and 69% of the global population\nexperience medium (categories 3 and 4) and low (categories 1 and 2) levels\nof disparity, with only 8% and 18% of the burned area, respectively. Toge-\nther, areas characterized by a high level of under-representation in wildﬁre\nresearch account for only 2% of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP, in\n2011 purchasing power parity international dollars), a demonstration of low\neconomic capacity for both wildﬁre management and research. In parti-\ncular, the high costs of implementing state-of-the-artﬁre management\nstrategies pose a substantial challenge for these communities with limited\neconomic resources\n17. Furthermore, developing economies in the tropics are\nalso vulnerable to rapid land-use changes18,19.T h e s ec h a n g e sc a nt r i g g e ra\npositive feedback loop involving wildﬁres, land use, and climate, further\nincreasing the likelihood and severity of wildﬁres. In addition to burned\nareas, it is important to note thatﬁre emissions may impact or extend to\nplaces beyond local ecosystems via atmospheric transportation (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 3). Especially, public health expenditures associated with\nexposure to openﬁres impose a considerable burden on regions marked by\nlarge disparities in wildﬁre research14, often due to inadequate study and\nresearch. In our analysis, we found that 39% of the population and 24% of\nsocioeconomic development were exposed to high imbalance level, most of\nwhich lack of adequate representation, with 77% of totalﬁre-induced carbon\nemissions. In contrast, 41% of the population and 48% of the GDP were\nfound in regions with low imbalance levels, with only 5% of total wildﬁre\nemissions. It should also be mentioned that our analysis may still fall short in\nfully assessing complexity and scale of imbalances, given the diverse sig-\nniﬁcance and impacts of wildﬁres across different regions and ecosystems.\nFor example, a large proportion of burned area in Africa comes from routine\nseasonal burning in savanna and cropland\n20. On the other hand, the high-\nlatitude forests act as essential carbon sink but are concurrently highly\nsusceptible to severe wildﬁres, which can lead to profound disruptions in\ntheir carbon sequestration and release processes21.\nBuilding on the conceptual framework ofﬁre research components\nknown as the “ﬁre triangle” model22, we further examined changes in\nresearch attention to different wildﬁre topics since 1980s (Fig.4). Overall,\n“vegetation” attracted the most attention in terms of the amount of litera-\nture, not only due to its direct ecological and socioeconomic impacts caused\nby vegetationﬁres but also its critical role as“fuel” in the“ﬁre triangle.” With\nrapidly changingﬁre weather driven by climate change, the aspect of“cli-\nmate” in ﬁre research has gradually become a focus of recent wildﬁre-related\nresearch. Regarding ignition sources,our analysis revealed changes in both\nthe quantity and varying levels of attention given to human versus natural\ncauses across different regions (Supplementary Fig. 4). Human-causedﬁres\nare increasingly dominating wildﬁre research in South America, Europe,\nand numerous parts of Asia. Although in regions like the Amazon and\nSoutheast Asia, commodity-driven deforestation remains the primary cause\nof forest loss\n23,24, ﬁres ignited for land clearing purposes to create cropland,\nBurned area (Mha) Population GDP-ppp (2011,USD)\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\n(1,2)\n(3,4)\n(5,6)\nPercent of total affected amount\n18%\n8%\n72%\n69%\n14%\n8%\n71%\n15%\n2%\nGrouped imbalance level\n1 32\n4 65\nnumber of \npublications\n(Unit: yr-1)\nlarger smaller\nburned area (Unit: ha yr-1)\nlarger\nsmaller\n90th 50th\n90th\n31.6 19.5\n554.3\nFig. 3 | Pervasive imbalances measured by the numbers of wildﬁre-related pub-\nlications and satellite-based burned areas.We classiﬁed the pixels into three major\ncategories with imbalance level scales from 1 to 6. The percentile thresholds for pixels\nwere established at the 50th and 90th percentiles for assessing the relative scale of\npublications, ensuring inclusion of studies spanning from 1980 to 2022. These\nthresholds corresponded to multi-year averages of 19.5 and 31.6 papers per year,\nrespectively. Regarding burned area analysis, a 90th percentile threshold (equivalent\nto 554.3 hectares per year) and a frequency threshold (requiring at least 90% cov-\nerage across the entire temporal span of the burned area product) were applied.\nBlank pixels indicate areas where no burned area was observed within AVHRR-\nLTDR\n31.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01341-7 Article\nCommunications Earth & Environment|           (2024) 5:168 3\npastures, and plantations are common practices23.T h e s eﬁres sometimes\nspiral out of human control and can escalate into numerous activeﬁre spots\nand extensive burned area25,26. Among the research with inferred ignition\nsources,“Vegetation,”“ Atmospheric” are ranked as the top topics for both\nthe human and natural-causedﬁres in most areas. China and India show\ndifferent preferences in ignition studies, likely due to the lower percentage of\nburned areas, higher instances of crop residual burning, and heightened\npopulation exposure\n27,28.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the utilization of LLM allowed us to efﬁciently and quickly\nmonitor research trends across numerous speciﬁc research questions and\nobjectives, while also in a transparent and upgradable manner. By\ndeploying an AI-aided approach, we uncovered large disparities among\nvarious wildﬁre research components and quantiﬁed their associated\nlevels of imbalance with an extensive database of tens of thousands of\npeer-reviewed papers. This becomes especially relevant in light of the\nongoing rapid global changes that are expected to heightenﬁre risks\n29,30.\nWe found that the pronounced imbalances in manyﬁre-prone regions\n(e.g., Africa and the Amazon) coincides with the less-developed and less-\nresilient to increasingﬁre activities. Such disparity undermines our ability\nto understand the historical role ofﬁre in local ecosystems and society, and\nto design mitigation strategies coping with anticipated future global\nchanges.\nMethods\nQuery from bibliographic database\nTo identify and gather as much relevant literature as possible on the topic of\n“wildﬁres,” we conducted a thorough search of the Web of Science biblio-\ngraphic database. The detail of searching and query results are demonstrated\nas below:\n1. Temporal range: 1900-13th Feb. 2023\n2. Keywords: see details in Supplementary Table 1\nA total of 103,720 peer-reviewed papers and conference reports were\nselected from the query after duplicates removed.\nInformation extraction\nWe implemented the gpt-3.5-turbo model by utilizing the OpenAI API,\nwhich is identical to the model used in the ChatGPT product and requires no\nﬁne-tuning steps. Based on 1,569 independently screened results (with 899\nidentiﬁed as“related to wildﬁre research” through human classiﬁcation), we\nemployed a cross-validation approach to test the model’s ability to make\n“rational” decisions and automatically eliminate items with little relevance to\nthe key topic. Binary comparisons between the model outputs and human-\nsupervised results achieved an average F1 score of 0.85 through bootstrapping\nwith 1000 repetitions, a value comparable to that of previous research based\non BERT. Initially, 72,352– 80,297 papers were selected as belonging to the\ncategory “related to wildﬁre research” based on various descriptions of\nprompt instructions. We systematically designed a set of advanced prompts\nto extract relevant information fromthe literature, such as the major and\nminor disciplines, study are a ,s t u d yp e r i o d ,s t a g eo fﬁre (wholeﬁre process/\npre-ﬁre/actively burning/post-ﬁre), and other key information summarized\nfrom abstracts. To ensure maximum coverage, we carefully tested and reﬁned\nthe prompts. Additionally, we utilized the geoparser capabilities of the model\nto extract location information from the text and converted it to sets of\ncoordinates describing the maximum boundaries of geographical entities at\n1° spatial resolution. Country codes under the standard ISO-3166 were also\nreturned where applicable. The valid geoparsing results within the scope of\nwildﬁre research returned a total of 60,488 articles, making up the primary\ndatabase for subsequent analysis. The workﬂow, including the geolocation\nparsing process, is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1.\nPrompt examples\nIn contrast to feature engineering, data cleaning, and other machine-\nlearning processing approaches, LLMs prefer prompting interfaces as the\nmethod to interact with them. The quality of prompts directly affects the\neffectiveness of results. Here, we provide the prompt lines that used in this\nstudy to extract information:\nKey information extraction\n“You are a perfect classiﬁer.

This product was adjusted to match the 2015 Revision of the\nUnited Nation’s World Population Prospects (UN WPP) country totals\nfor the years from 2000 to 2020 at 5-year intervals\n32. Socioeconomic\ndevelopment indicators were obtained from Gridded global datasets for\nGross Domestic Product from 1990 to 2015\n33. We resampled and repro-\njected the results from above datasets to align with the same preferences as\nthe publication patterns.\nData availability\nGlobal Detection of Long-Term (1982– 2017) Burned Area with AVHRR-\nLTDR Data is publicly available from ESA Climate Change Initiative\n(Fire_cci) (https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/ﬁre/).
