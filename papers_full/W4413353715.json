With its unique advantages—crossing physical boundaries and reconstructing global\nvalue chains—digital trade is playing an increasingly critical role. According to authoritative data from\nthe 2024 Global Digital Trade Development Report, the total volume of global digital trade grew steadily\nfrom USD 6.02 trillion in 2021 to USD 7.13 trillion in 2023, with an average annual compound growth\nrate of 8.8%. Amid mounting global economic challenges such as inflationary pressures and geopolitical\nconflicts, digital trade has demonstrated strong resilience. At the same time, in the process of establishing\na new development paradigm, China’s digital trade has shown robust vitality and has become a “new\n© The Authors 2025.Article History Received: March 15, 2025; Accpted: April 10, 2025; Published: June 30, 2025.Integration\nof Industry and Education Journal, ISSN 2791-2671 (Print), ISSN 2791-268X (Online).

In the first half of 2024, China’s imports\nand exports of digitally deliverable services reached 1.42 trillion yuan, marking a year-on-year increase\nof 3.7%. This data not only indicates that digital trade has become a core component of China’s service\ntrade but also reflects the country’s growing international competitiveness in cloud computing, artificial\nintelligence, cross-border e-commerce, and other sectors. Importantly, in the complex context of slowing\nglobal economic growth and rising trade protectionism, digital trade has served as a key stabilizing force\nfor China’s service trade to achieve growth against the broader trend.\nHowever, with the rapid development of digital trade, it faces increasingly complex global governance\nchallenges, and the restrictive effects of various digital trade barriers have become increasingly prominent.\nAmong these, the fragmentation of regional digital trade rules stands out as a key structural obstacle. De-\npending on their respective technological advantages, industrial structures, and value orientations, different\neconomies have developed divergent regional regulatory systems. Some countries emphasize the protec-\ntion of development rights in the global rule-making process and seek to balance security with openness;\nothers focus on data sovereignty and security, establishing protective mechanisms such as data localization\nrequirements and cross-border data review procedures. This parallel multi-rule system not only forces\nenterprises to comply with multiple standards in cross-border trade—significantly increasing compliance\ncosts and operational complexity—but also risks creating “digital islands” due to regulatory conflicts, hin-\ndering the efficient global allocation of data elements and the inclusive application of digital technologies.\nIn this context, overcoming the barriers posed by rule fragmentation and fostering a more inclusive and\ninteroperable global digital trade governance system have become urgent tasks to ensure the sustainable\nand healthy development of digital trade and to unlock its growth potential.\nAt present, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology offer new possibilities for regulatory\nadaptation. As intelligent systems capable of autonomous perception, decision-making, and execution, AI\nagents have demonstrated the ability to analyze rules and dynamically adapt in fields such as financial com-\npliance and cross-border logistics. For example, Amazon’s intelligent compliance assistant can adapt in\nreal time to the cross-border e-commerce regulations of multiple countries, effectively reducing the time\nrequired for product listing review. However, few scholars have taken AI agents as a primary analytical\nlens to explore their deeper mechanisms in addressing the fragmentation of digital trade rules. In particu-\nlar, there remains a lack of systematic exploration regarding the enabling logic of such technologies, their\npotential practical applications, and their strategic role in regulatory adaptation. This research gap not\nonly limits the cognitive depth of technology-enabled trade governance innovation, but also leaves enter-\nprises and policymakers without effective theoretical support or operational models for navigating complex\nregulatory environments using AI agents. Therefore, starting from the key entry point of regulatory adap-\ntation, the systematic investigation of the unique opportunities and implementation strategies offered by\nAI agents to address digital trade barriers can help bridge existing gaps in the literature on technological\nempowerment and trade regulation. Moreover, such research provides a novel theoretical perspective and\nan analytical framework that offers both theoretical depth and practical guidance for Chinese digital trade\nentities seeking to manage regulatory diversity and enhance international competitiveness.\n2 Literature review\nThe rapid development of digital trade has made it a key topic in international trade research, while digital\ntradebarriers—particularlyregulatoryfragmentation—significantlyrestrictitsfurtherexpansion. Simulta-\nneously, the emergence of AI agent technology has opened new possibilities for resolving these challenges,\nand related studies are gradually emerging.\nDigital trade refers to a new mode of commerce aligned with the digital economy. It leverages digital\ntechnologies to facilitate the transmission, transaction, and consumption of goods and services, thereby\nYing LUO, etc. 77\ngreatly expanding the range of tradable goods and services[1]. Existing research on digital trade generally\nfalls into three categories: (1) the definition and theoretical foundations of digital trade; (2) the measure-\nment of digital trade development; and (3) the economic, social, and environmental impacts of digital\ntrade growth[2]. For instance, Li (2020) argued that digital trade consists of two components—digital\ntrade proper and trade digitalization—which correspond to digital services, digital goods, digital delivery,\nand digital ordering[3]. Zhao (2025) measured the digital trade volume of major world economies using\nboth narrow and broad definitions[4]. Zheng (2025), employing a multi-phase DID model, demonstrated\nthat digital trade significantly promotes innovation in retail enterprises—particularly in business model\ninnovation. This impact occurs primarily through three channels: transaction cost reduction, supply chain\noptimization, and the creation of digital demand[5].\nWith the vigorous development of digital trade, various trade barriers have emerged accordingly.\nThese range from restrictions on cross-border data flows to differences in regulatory standards, from\ndiscrepancies in digital taxation rules to obstacles posed by platform monopolies. Together, these fac-\ntors constitute multiple barriers that hinder the sustainable growth of digital trade. Digital trade barriers\nspecifically refer to a variety of restrictive measures imposed by host governments in pursuit of national\ninterests[6]. Currently, scholars have widely examined the manifestations, potential impacts, and coun-\ntermeasures related to digital trade barriers, producing substantial research findings. For instance, Yang\n(2025) argued that in addition to traditional tariffs, digital trade barriers also encompass cross-border data\nrestrictions, personal data protection, and intellectual property concerns[7]. Xia (2024) highlighted chal-\nlenges in regulating data flows across borders, including regulatory fragmentation, misaligned governance\ndemands, outdated taxation systems, and difficulties in data classification[8]. Sun (2025) noted the existence\nof discriminatory conditions for e-commerce licenses, deviations from international standards in cross-\nborder transaction rules, and inadequacies in e-commerce-related legislation[9]. Qiang (2024) emphasized\nthat such discriminatory licensing requirements and the lack of enforceability of electronic signatures in-\ncrease both administrative and contractual costs for service enterprises engaged in export activities within\nthe value chain[10]. Liu (2025) empirically verified that digital services trade barriers significantly hinder\nthe export competitiveness of the manufacturing sector by weakening technological innovation, reduc-\ning human capital spillovers, and diminishing value-added effects[11]. Zhu (2025), using panel data from\n72 of China’s trading partners, found that digital services trade barriers negatively affect ICT exports by\nincreasing the bilateral trade costs[12].\nWith the rapid evolution of generative AI technology, AI agents have gained the ability to plan, ex-\necute, and learn independently, and are gradually becoming key participants in the business world. An\nAI agent refers to a software program, information system, or other type of entity that can perceive the\nexternal environment and independently make decisions and execute tasks based on predefined goals or\nuser instructions. It exhibits strong flexibility and adaptability, with significant advantages in rule analysis,\ntask execution, and cross-border compliance[13]. At present, a growing number of scholars have begun\nto explore the enabling advantages of AI agents in fields such as data analysis, negotiation guidance, ed-\nucation and instruction, healthcare, transportation, and commercial markets. In-depth research has been\nconducted on their conceptual features, classification systems, practical applications, and more. For exam-\nple, Zhou (2024) pointed out that the advancement of AI agents can be evaluated from four dimensions:\npracticality, sociality, value criteria, and the ability to evolve sustainably[14]. Yang (2024) used multi-agent\nsystems to integrate data from different sources to accurately predict stock market volatility and enhance\nfinancial market risk assessment and forecasting[15]. Han (2024) designed an AI agent model for multi-\nmodal data processing, using the analysis of financial annual reports in smart investment scenarios as an\nexample[16]. Zhao (2025) emphasized that with the continued expansion of AI agent application scenarios,\nit is important to consider how to achieve the dual legislative objectives of protecting personal information\nand promoting its reasonable use at the practical level[17].\n78 Integration of Industry and Education JournalVolume 4, Issue 2, 2025\nHowever, research on integrating AI agents with digital trade barrier resolution is still in its infancy.\nExisting literature mostly focuses on the application of AI technologies to specific aspects of digital trade,\nsuch as customer service and supply chain management in cross-border e-commerce, or discusses the con-\nflicts and coordination of digital trade rules in isolation. These studies fail to fully explore the potential of\nAI agents in addressing the fragmentation of digital trade rules and lack systematic research on integrating\nthe two dimensions. Therefore, based on the core perspective of rule adaptation, this paper aims to fill\nthe gap in the current literature by systematically exploring the integration of AI agents with digital trade\nbarrier resolution. Specifically, by constructing an analytical framework of “technology empowerment￿\nrule transformation ￿ecological synergy,” this paper investigates the mechanisms through which AI agents\nanalyze fragmented digital trade rules, dynamically adapt to differentiated regulatory requirements, and\npromote rule compatibility and collaborative governance. It identifies the unique opportunities of AI agents\nin overcoming rule fragmentation and develops a strategic framework characterized by both theoretical\ninnovation and practical operability. This not only provides a new theoretical explanation for the techno-\nlogical resolution of digital trade barriers but also offers targeted theoretical support and strategic guidance\nfor enterprises to manage complex regulatory environments, enhance cross-border trade efficiency, and\nsupport countries’ participation in global digital governance.\n3 The Dilemma of Rule Adaptation of Digital Trade Barriers\nThe dilemma of rule adaptation in digital trade barriers is essentially a structural contradiction between\nthe fragmentation of the global digital governance system and the large-scale development of digital trade.\nSpecifically, it manifests in three intertwined challenges that together constitute the compliance barriers\nfaced by enterprises engaged in cross-border operations.\nFirst, the fragmentation and differentiation of the rule system have created a standard maze. The World\nTrade Organization (WTO) consists of a package of multilateral trade agreements established at the end\nof the 20th century, covering trade in goods, services, and intellectual property. As the core mechanism of\nglobal trade governance, the WTO should theoretically serve as a foundational framework for regulating\ndigital trade and cross-border data flows. However, in practice, member states are often able to circumvent\ncontractual obligations through flexible interpretations of service categories, leading to divergent demands\nand the adoption of restrictive measures. More importantly, when multilateral rule systems fail to keep pace\nwith the evolving needs of digital trade, major economies increasingly resort to unilateral legislation, as\nwell as bilateral or regional trade agreements, to seek breakthroughs. Agreements such as the Comprehen-\nsive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive\nEconomic Partnership (RCEP) have placed cross-border data flow at the core of their digital trade agen-\ndas, aiming to address new regulatory challenges. However, these regional frameworks reflect divergent\nvalue orientations and national interests: some emphasize barrier-free flow, others preserve localization\nexceptions, while still others focus on development-oriented governance. This multi-regulatory orienta-\ntion has resulted in a high degree of rule heterogeneity. For instance, even in the domain of cross-border\ndata flow alone, there exist over ten distinct compliance mechanisms, including “adequacy determination,”\n“standard contractual clauses,” and “security assessments.” For enterprises seeking to enter multiple mar-\nkets, adapting to these diverse rules and standards significantly increases compliance costs. In some cases,\nfirms may even fall into a “compliance paradox,” whereby fulfilling one jurisdiction’s requirements results\nin violations in another due to rule conflicts.\nSecond, semantic ambiguity and regulatory volatility exacerbate compliance uncertainty. Digital trade\nrules involve numerous abstract concepts, whose meanings evolve alongside technological development\nand often lack clear definitional standards. For example, the categorization of key terms such as “personal\nsensitive information,” “important data,” and “digital services” differs significantly across jurisdictions. This\nYing LUO, etc. 79\nsemantic ambiguity makes it difficult for enterprises to accurately determine the boundaries of compliance.\nAs a result, they must allocate significant resources to interpret the rules—yet may still face compliance risks\ndue to misinterpretation. To make matters more complex, the pace of regulatory change has accelerated.\nWith the emergence of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and the metaverse, many countries\nhave frequently revised their digital trade rules. In 2023 alone, 37 countries worldwide updated terms\nrelated to cross-border data flows. In some cases, the regulatory revision cycles are even shorter than the\nupdate cycles of enterprises’compliance systems. This widening gap between technological innovation\nand regulatory adjustment places enterprises in a constant state of reactive compliance.\nThird, the hierarchical complexity and regional discrepancies in rule implementation pose significant\nbarriers to effective compliance. Digital trade regulations span a multi-level system ranging from interna-\ntional agreements to local rules, forming a pyramid structure comprising global rules, regional agreements,\ndomestic legislation, industry standards, and local-level policies. At the international level, the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) has made little progress in developing specific agreements on cross-border\ndata flows and has yet to establish a dedicated framework in this domain. Regional agreements such as the\nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the United States￿Mexico ￿Canada Agree-\nment (USMCA) contain digital provisions, but differences remain across their respective digital clauses. At\nthe national level, conflicts may arise between legislative texts and administrative practices. For instance,\nwhile national laws may permit the free flow of data, regulatory agencies may impose implicit restrictions\nthrough internal administrative guidance. At the industry level, self-regulatory standards in different sec-\ntors further refine compliance expectations—for example, data encryption protocols in the financial sector\nor privacy protection norms in the healthcare field. This layering of multi-level regulations requires enter-\nprises to undertake end-to-end compliance. However, due to limited resources, small and medium-sized\nenterprises (SMEs) often struggle to satisfy the requirements across all regulatory levels and may be forced\nto exit certain international markets. Moreover, the same rule may be implemented with varying degrees\nof enforcement in different jurisdictions. Even when countries sign mutual recognition agreements, inter-\npretation discrepancies and varying enforcement priorities among local agencies can lead to inconsistent\ncompliance outcomes.\n4 Opportunities for AI Agents in Addressing Rule Adaptation Dilemmas in Digital\nTrade\n4.1 Semantic Transformation Opportunity of Rule Parsing\nThemostbasicandcoreopportunityforAIagents tosolvethedilemmaofruleadaptationliesintheirability\nto accurately transform the semantics of rules, which fundamentally changes the inefficiency and fuzziness\nof traditional manual rule interpretation. The texts of digital trade rules are often filled with technical terms,\nabstract expressions, and implicit logic, and the semantic meanings of rules in different language versions\nmay also diverge, together constituting the first obstacle for enterprises to understand and apply such\nrules. In the traditional model, enterprises are required to organize legal and compliance teams to interpret\nrules word by word, a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to subjective judgment.\nIn contrast, AI agents, empowered by language models or multimodal models, can rapidly process vast\nquantities of regulatory texts, convert textual information into structured rule databases, and decompose\nthem into quantifiable and comparable compliance indicators using algorithmic methods. Throughout\nthis process, AI agents achieve in-depth semantic interpretation of unstructured rule texts by integrating\nnatural language processing, knowledge graphs, and deep learning technologies. The value of this semantic\ntransformation is not only to enhance the efficiency of understanding but also to construct a machine-\nexecutable rule base. For instance, when an enterprise must simultaneously comply with the General\n80 Integration of Industry and Education JournalVolume 4, Issue 2, 2025\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union and the Personal Information Protection Law\nof China, AI agents can automatically extract provisions related to the right to data deletion, compare\ntheir respective scopes, conditions of exercise, and exceptions, and generate a visualized chart highlighting\npoints of overlap and divergence to help enterprises quickly identify both the intersections and conflicts\nof compliance. More importantly, this semantic transformation capability is reusable and extensible. As\nnew rules emerge, AI agents can continuously optimize their semantic models through transfer learning,\ngradually constructing a comprehensive knowledge graph of digital trade rules across major economies.\nThis allows enterprises to understand and compare multiple regulatory systems under a unified technical\nframework, thereby reducing compliance risks caused by semantic ambiguity at the source.\n4.2 Real-Time Response Opportunities for Dynamic Compliance\nThe dynamic adjustment of digital trade rules and regional differences make enterprises constantly face a\npassive situation in which their internal compliance strategies cannot keep pace with regulatory changes.\nAI agents, with their real-time monitoring and adaptive decision-making capabilities, provide a key oppor-\ntunity to solve this dilemma. In the traditional compliance model, enterprises often track rule changes by\nregularly consulting official announcements, hiring external consultants, and conducting periodic inter-\nnal assessments. However, such lagging mechanisms may cause enterprises to continue applying outdated\ncompliance strategies after rules have already been updated, thus exposing themselves to potential regula-\ntory risks. Meanwhile, differences in the implementation of the same rule across regions make it difficult\nfor enterprises to grasp local enforcement intensity in real time. AI agents can rely on algorithm-driven\nreinforcement learning to continuously optimize decision-making models by dynamically adjusting the\nweight parameters of rule interpretation. This enables the construction of a closed-loop compliance sys-\ntem, encompassing monitoring, analysis, and responsive decision-making, thereby achieving dynamic and\naccurate compliance management. In the rule monitoring phase, AI agents can capture revised draft rules,\neffective regulatory announcements, and law enforcement cases in real time by interfacing with open data\nplatforms from national legislatures and regulatory authorities. Furthermore, they can predict the direction\nand scope of rule adjustments by analyzing sources such as news archives, policy interpretation briefings,\nand official consultations. In the analysis phase, AI agents can compare enforcement cases across different\nregions and extract key similarities and differences. In the strategy response phase, they can automatically\ngenerate adjustment schemes tailored to enterprise-specific compliance goals and business characteristics.\nFor example, when a country tightens tax regulations for cross-border e-commerce, the AI agent can im-\nmediately calculate the changes in tax burden under various pricing strategies and recommend the most\nsuitable compliance response.\n4.3 Consensus-Building Opportunities for Cross-Domain Collaboration\nThe fragmentation of digital trade rules is, at its core, a reflection of divergent interests among various\nstakeholders. AI agents offer a technological opportunity to break this deadlock by facilitating consensus-\nbuilding through their cross-domain collaboration capabilities. Whether in intergovernmental rule ne-\ngotiations, inter-enterprise compliance coordination, or regulatory-market interactions, all parties face\npersistent challenges of information asymmetry. AI agents can act as neutral technological intermediaries\nthat promote consensus through enhanced data sharing and balanced interest alignment. At the interna-\ntional rule coordination level, AI agents can leverage big data analysis to identify the “maximum common\ndenominator” among regulatory systems of different economies, thereby assisting negotiators in formu-\nlating more inclusive proposals. This approach to consensus-building does not aim to impose uniform\nstandards, but rather to enhance rule compatibility while respecting existing differences. By quantify-\ning the implementation costs and benefits associated with different regulatory regimes, AI agents enable\nYing LUO, etc. 81\nstakeholders to recognize the mutual value of rule recognition and its contribution to shared objectives.\nThis technology-driven approach to consensus-building can not only help resolve the current dilemma\nof rule fragmentation but also offer an innovative, win-win pathway for the future of global digital trade\ngovernance.\n4.4 Technology Adaptation: Building an AI Agent Rule Parsing System\nThe construction of an AI agent-based rule parsing system should prioritize enterprise usability as its core\nobjective. To achieve this, the system must reduce technical barriers through modular design, allowing the\nrule parsing capabilities of AI agents to be integrated seamlessly into daily business operations. This system\nprimarily consists of two components: a multimodal rule knowledge base and a scenario-based compli-\nance engine. For the construction of the multimodal rule knowledge base, digital trade regulation texts\nfrom major trading countries—such as laws, administrative regulations, departmental rules, and official\ninterpretations—can be batch-collected from authoritative legal databases to form a foundational corpus.\nNext, the technical team should develop a lightweight annotation tool and collaborate with legal experts\nto annotate key terms, such as “cross-border data” and “personal information,” across multiple languages.\nFor example, the term “controller” under the GDPR is mapped to “personal information processor” in\nChina’s Personal Information Protection Law. Automated term alignment and cross-lingual semantic\nmatching can then be achieved through large language model training, ensuring that more than 95%\nof frequently used terms are accurately identified by AI agents. Finally, the system connects to official\nregulatory announcement channels and includes a keyword-based monitoring feature. Upon detecting\na rule revision, the knowledge base triggers an automatic update process, completes iteration within 24\nhours, and pushes change notifications to enterprise clients. For the scenario-based compliance engine,\nthe system must provide a plug-and-play toolkit tailored to specific digital trade use cases. In the context\nof cross-border e-commerce, a compliance checking plug-in can be embedded within an enterprise’s\ninternal ERP system. When product information is entered, the plug-in automatically matches relevant\nimport regulations based on the HS code. For instance, upon entry of a “children’s smartwatch,” the\nsystem can immediately display CE certification requirements for the EU, FCC standards for the U.S.,\nand national privacy restrictions concerning the product’s built-in camera. A comprehensive compli-\nance checklist is then generated, including testing agencies, procedural steps, and cost estimates. In the\ndomain of cross-border data, a “data flow sandbox” tool allows enterprises to upload sample datasets. The\ntool automatically identifies the data type and simulates the compliance pathway for transmission to the\ndestination country.\n4.5 Rule Transformation: Promoting the Connection Between Technology Adaptation Results\nand Institutional Rules\nAI agents analyze regulatory requirements in digital trade and generate solutions that answer the question\nof “how to meet those requirements.”However, the compliance outcomes produced by AI agents must\nbe recognized by multiple stakeholders. It is crucial not only to give enterprises confidence in following\nsystem recommendations, but also to ensure that regulatory authorities approve the compliance results\ngenerated by AI systems. This dual recognition is key to facilitating broader adoption and application of\nAI agents in regulatory contexts. Accordingly, this stage requires the gradual institutionalization of the\nadaptation outputs generated by AI agents—such as specific compliance solutions, operational guidelines,\nand quantitative indicators—into industry norms and formalized regulatory frameworks. Through prac-\ntical implementation and mechanism design, these outputs can gain legitimacy at the enterprise, industry,\nand regulatory levels, eventually serving as a basis for standardized or referenceable compliance practices.\nFirst, technical outputs should be applied to real-world problems to generate replicable cases. When\n82 Integration of Industry and Education JournalVolume 4, Issue 2, 2025\nenterprises engage in cross-border digital trade, they can utilize AI agents to analyze the digital trade rules\nof their target markets. Based on the enterprise’s operational characteristics, the AI agent produces tailored\ncompliance recommendations. After executing the business plan and completing regulatory inspection, the\nenterprise compiles key aspects—such as the use case, implementation details, and compliance performance\n—into a standardized case record. Second, mature technical solutions should be translated into industry\nstandards. Under the leadership of national cross-border e-commerce pilot zones and industry associa-\ntions, case studies of AI agent use in compliance can be collected and analyzed. Quantifiable compliance\nindicators can be extracted—such as the mandatory data fields identified by the AI agent for cross-border\npayments, or prohibited data categories. These indicators can then be compiled into technical specifica-\ntions, for example, a“Group Standard for Cross-Border Payment Data Compliance.”Once implemented,\nthis standard can allow enterprises to access a compliance fast-track during reviews by customs, taxation,\nand other regulatory agencies, thereby reducing the frequency of repetitive on-site verifications. Finally,\nefforts should be made to align technical standards with formal regulatory frameworks. Pilot programs for\nmutual recognition of AI-generated compliance results can be conducted within free trade zones. In these\npilots, compliance reports generated by designated AI systems can serve as the basis for applications for\ncross-border data transfer licenses. Regulatory authorities would then only need to verify the format and\ncompleteness of such reports, reducing the burden of manual review. Once proven effective, the mutual\nrecognition mechanism can be expanded to bilateral or regional governance frameworks.\n4.6 Ecological Collaboration: Building a Collaborative Network for Breaking Down Barriers\nthrough Multi-Agent Participation\nThe removal of digital trade barriers is not the responsibility of any single entity; it requires coordinated ef-\nforts among governments, enterprises, industrial chains, and international institutions. AI agents can serve\nas critical technological links that enable multi-party collaboration across these domains. Government-\nenterprise collaboration aims to address the resource limitations of small and medium-sized enterprises\n(SMEs) by establishing public service platforms for rule adaptation. These platforms can be government-\nled, co-developed by universities and tech enterprises, and provide open access to rule knowledge bases\nand AI-powered compliance tools for SMEs at no cost. The platform should provide three core functions:\nFirst, rule query and interpretation—SMEs can input keywords such as export destinations and busi-\nness types to receive AI-generated compliance checklists. Second, compliance diagnosis and optimization\n—by interfacing with enterprise ERP systems, AI agents can automatically scan business workflows to de-\ntect compliance risks. Third, dispute resolution support—when enterprises face cross-border compliance\ndisputes, the platform can utilize historical case databases and legal knowledge bases to offer intelligent\nassistance for issue identification, legal argumentation, and response strategies.\nInternational collaboration should leverage a digital rule adaptation alliance to enhance the compat-\nibility of cross-regional regulations. Countries along the Belt and Road Initiative and RCEP member\nstates can jointly build transnational rule knowledge bases and shared AI adaptation tools. This effort in-\nvolves solving three key challenges: First, the visual presentation of regulatory differences—by comparing\nkey terms across national regulations using AI agents, a heatmap of regulatory divergence can be gener-\nated, such as showing the strictness of data localization rules across ASEAN countries. Second, simulation\nand forecasting of compatible schemes—based on game-theoretical models, AI agents can predict how\ndifferent regulatory alignment strategies will affect trade flows and industry structures in each country,\nproviding empirical support for negotiations. Finally, rule update synchronization—rule revisions from\nalliance members can be shared in real time through encrypted channels, enabling agents to update the\nmultilateral rule base within 24 hours and reduce compliance risks caused by information lag.\nIndustrial chain collaboration requires the creation of cross-border compliance communities to facil-\nYing LUO, etc. 83\nitate coordinated compliance among enterprises within the supply chain. Leading enterprises can open\naccess to their proprietary AI agent systems, sharing rule interpretation models and compliance tools with\nupstream and downstream partners, thereby forming a chain-leader-driven model guiding SME com-\npliance. For instance, in the manufacturing sector, a lead manufacturer could integrate AI agents into\nits supply chain management system to disseminate regulatory requirements—such as EU carbon emis-\nsion standards or U.S. autonomous driving data regulations—to its component suppliers and monitor their\ncompliance status in real time. This form of industrial collaboration not only improves overall compliance\nefficiency but also enhances the international competitiveness of the entire supply chain through collective\ncapacity building.\n5 Challenges of AI Agent Applications\nAlthough AI agents can facilitate enterprises’digital trade activities to some extent, their widespread ap-\nplication is accompanied by a series of challenges and potential risks.\nThe heavy reliance of AI agents on data makes them high-risk vectors for privacy breaches. Relying\non AI agents to overcome the fragmentation of digital trade rules often requires access to large volumes\nof international trade regulatory data, including national tariff policies, import and export restrictions, and\ncross-border data flow regulations. Such data contain a certain degree of sensitivity, involving national\nregulatory details and corporate strategic planning. At the same time, the operation of AI agents frequently\nnecessitates real-time access to sensitive enterprise information, such as transaction records, customer data,\nand supply chain documentation. Such high-frequency, dynamic interactions between regulatory data\nand business data significantly increase the risk of disclosure. To mitigate this risk, enterprises should\nadopt strict security measures, including access control, encrypted transmission, and real-time monitoring,\nwhen deploying AI agents. In addition, enterprises can also implement role-based permission management\nsystems to assign differentiated data access rights to personnel at different organizational levels.\nSome countries question the reliability of AI-generated compliance results and continue to mandate\nmanual reviews, thereby limiting the broader implementation of such technologies. This skepticism arises\nlargely because, when AI agents generate compliance results, the relationship between input data and out-\nput outcomes is often difficult to understand or explain. The underlying algorithmic logic remains opaque\n—a typical black-box problem. As a result, managers often find it impossible to trace the basis for decision-\nmaking, and when deviations or errors occur, responsibility becomes difficult to define. To address this\nissue, it is essential to advance the standardization of AI compliance systems by introducing internationally\nrecognized technical certifications and ensuring algorithmic transparency, thereby enhancing the trust\nof regulatory authorities in AI-generated results. At the same time, a flexible mechanism that combines\nAI audits with manual spot checks can be established to improve approval efficiency while safeguarding\ncompliance integrity.\n6 Conclusion\nThe contradiction between the vigorous development of digital trade and the fragmentation of the global\nrule system has become a key bottleneck restricting the further promotion of global economic integration.\nFrom the core perspective of rule adaptation, this paper systematically explains the technical logic and\npractical path of AI agents in breaking digital trade barriers, reveals their unique value in rule analysis,\ndynamic compliance, and cross-domain collaboration, and constructs a three-level strategic framework of\n“technology adaptation, rule transformation, and ecological collaboration.” This study combines AI agents\nwith the adaptation of digital trade rules, fills the systematic research gap in the field of technology-enabled\ntrade governance, expands the theoretical perspective on breaking digital trade barriers, and provides a new\n84 Integration of Industry and Education JournalVolume 4, Issue 2, 2025\nanalyticalframeworkforunderstandingthe interactionbetweentechnologyandregulatorysystems. At the\nsame time, the proposed technical solutions, such as the multimodal rule knowledge base and the scenario-\nbased compliance engine, along with ecological strategies including government-enterprise collaboration\nand international alliances, offer practical reference pathways for enterprises to navigate complex regulatory\nenvironments and enhance cross-border trade efficiency.\nIn addition, AI agents in the application of breaking digital trade barriers continue to face significant\nchallenges, including data security risks, algorithmic black-box issues, and limited international mutual\nrecognition. Their technical maturity and institutional adaptability still require continuous optimization\nin practice. Future research can further focus on three aspects: First, improving the rule-parsing accuracy\nof AI agents in multilingual and multi-scenario contexts, particularly their adaptability to fuzzy semantics\nand dynamically adjusted rules; Second, validating the practical effectiveness of the strategic framework\nthrough specific industry case studies and refining the implementation schemes; Finally, building on the\nsynergy of technological innovation and institutional innovation to promote a more equitable and efficient\nglobal digital trade order, thereby injecting sustained momentum into the recovery and growth of the\nworld economy.\nReferences\n[1] Liu, H., & Zhao, W.
