  "abstract": "Many biometrics advancements have been widely used for security applications. This field’s evolution began with fingerprints and continued with periocular imaging, which has gained popularity due to the pandemic scenario. CNN (convolutional neural networks) has revolutionized the computer vision domain by demonstrating various state-of-the-art results (performance metrics) with the help of deep-learning-based architectures. The latest transformation has happened with the invention of transformers, which are used in NLP (natural language processing) and are presently being adapted for computer vision. In this work, we have implemented five different ViT- (vision transformer) based architectures for person identification and gender classification. The experiment was performed on the ViT architectures and their modified counterparts. In general, the samples selected for train:val:test splits are random, and the trained model may get affected by overfitting. To overcome this, we have performed 5-fold cross-validation-based analysis. The experiment’s performance matrix indicates that the proposed method achieved better results for gender classification as well as person identification. We also experimented with train-val-test partitions for benchmarking with existing architectures and observed significant improvements. We utilized the publicly available UBIPr dataset for performing this experimentation.",
