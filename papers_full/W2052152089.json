Revista chilena de ingeniería, vol. 20 Nº 2, 2012\n186\nIn recent years, the environmental aspect has become \nimportant and development of clean and technically \nfunctional technologies is of high demand. With the \ndevelopment of vegetable oils for use in electrical \nequipment, an alternative appears with advantages \nregarding safety and the environment [1-5]. \nNonetheless, many questions arise when adopting \nthis new technology: Is it necessary to redesign the \ntransformer? How is the final disposition of these \noils handled? Are these fluids compatible with the \ntransformer’s internal materials? Are they viable \nfrom the economic point of view? In this respect, \nseveral studies have been undertaken, mainly by \nmanufacturers of these oils and by some research \ninstitutions and universities [6-15]. \nIn the thermal evaluation, the literature shows a higher \noil temperature rise in transformers immersed in \nvegetable oil [2]. This higher temperature rise would \nsuggest a lower useful lifespan than for transformers \nwith mineral oil; however, given that paper degrades \nmuch slower in the presence of vegetable oil these \ntransformers could have an equal or greater useful \nlifetime than those immersed in mineral oil [5]. The \npossibility exists of overloading transformers that \nuse vegetable oil. This fact is substantiated in that \nunder nominal load conditions these transformers \nhave a useful life that could be longer than that \nfor those submerged in mineral oil, which would \npermit overloading the transformer at a given level \nand maintaining the same useful life as that of a \ntransformer submerged in mineral oil [5-9].\nIn Colombia, research was conducted by Universidad \ndel Valle in association with an electric sector \ncompany, which evaluated the thermal behavior \nof two conventional-type distribution, single-phase \ntransformers immersed in dielectric vegetable oil \nand physical, chemical, and spectral tests were \nconducted, as well as experiments of oil accelerated \naging, designed to analyze possible changes in the \nstructure of the oil molecules [13]. \nThis article presents the results of the thermal \nevaluation of the two distribution transformers \nsubmerged in Envirotemp® FR3™ vegetable oil.\nEXPERIMENTATION\nThis research used four single-phase distribution \ntransformers with two different powers (15 kV A \nand 37.5 kV A) constructed by Rymel Ltd. These \ntransformers have designs normally employed \nin Colombia. For each power rating, there was a \ntransformer immersed in vegetable oil and another \nimmersed in mineral oil; these were instrumented \nwith optical fiber sensors. The instrumentation \nin the distribution transformers was conducted \nexclusively for investigative purposes (given its \nhigh costs) and it is not widely reported in the \nliterature [16].\nBased on prior experiences by the High-V oltage \nResearch Group (GRALTA for its name in Spanish), \nin the instrumentation of a distribution transformer \nusing thermocouples, five temperature measurement \nzones were defined; one located above the bottom \nof the tank, another below the upper oil level, two \non the windings (high voltage and low voltage), \nand one in the core. The transformers were \ninstrumented with sensors placed in previously \nselected points [16] (Figure 1); all the measurements, \nexcept for that of the core, were made with optical \nfiber sensors. To determine the placement of the \nsensors, also considering the technical viability \nof their installation, we had the thermal profiles \nof the transformer obtained through simulation \nwith the finite elements ANSYS 11 software \n(Figures 2 and 3).\nThe transformers were evaluated through temperature \nelevation tests via the simulated-load method (short \ncircuit) [17]; a total of 41 tests were run. To measure \ntemperature with the optical fiber sensors we used \na Neoptix Omniflex optical fiber system, we also \nused a platform developed in Labview, permitting \nthe automation and control of the tests. Measurement \nof electrical variables and their incorporation onto \nthe platform was carried out with Dranetz Encore \n61000 equipment.\nFigure 1.  Instrumented distribution transformer.\nFernando-Navas, Echeverry-Ibarra y Cadavid-Ramírez: Evaluation of the use of a vegetable oil in distribution transformers\n187\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe thermal behavior of the transformers evaluated \nin this research was conducted with respect to the \ntemperature rise in the oil, windings, and in the \nhottest spot, under conditions of simulated load.\nMagneto-thermal simulation via MEF\nAmong the main concerns at the start of the \nproject were the temperature differences reached \nin the transformer under operation upon replacing \nmineral oil for vegetable oil because of the higher \nviscosity of vegetal oil. With this in mind, we \nconducted steady-state simulations implementing \nthe geometry of a 15 kV A transformer. The results \nof the simulations are shown in Figure 2 (mineral \noil) and Figure 3 (vegetable oil). It can be noted \nthat the maximum temperature in the mineral oil is \nde 317 K (44 °C) and in the vegetable oil is 319 K \n(46 °C), which shows a maximum temperature rise \nof approximately 2 °C, agreeing with that obtained \nexperimentally.\nSimulated load at constant reference\nThermal behavior of oil\nFor the transformers evaluated, the oil temperature \nrise was higher in the transformers submerged in \nvegetable oil; however, the greatest difference was \nnoted for the 37.5 kV A transformers where it was \napproximately 5 °C. Figure 4 shows the result of \nthe oil temperature rise obtained for each of the \ntransformers analyzed.\n15 kVA Mineral 15 kVA Vegetable 37.5 kVA Mineral 37.5 kVA Vegetable\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10 Temperature Rise [°C]\n0\nTop Oil Average Oil Bottom Oil Nominal\nFigure 4.  Oil temperature rise.\nThe oil temperature rise was smaller than the one \nspecified by international standards. (60 °C) [18]. \nThis may be explained because in Colombia big tanks \nare normally used to maintain the recommended \nelectrical distances for their voltage levels; hence, \nthey can be denominated “cold transformers”. \nThis situation would permit the use of vegetable \noil without need for modifying transformer design.\nThermal behavior of the winding\nThe winding temperature rise was obtained by \nmeasuring winding resistance and from direct \nmeasurement by the optical fiber sensors placed in \nzones of interest defined by thermal simulations. \nFigure 5 shows the winding temperature rise in the \ntransformers studied.\nThe difference between calculated values and \nthose measured directly in the winding is because \nthe calculation method estimates a temperature \naverage, while the direct measurement shows a \nspecific value. Values for the winding nominal \naverage rise (DqW/A,R) both for the transformer \nsubmerged in mineral oil as for that in vegetable \nFigure 2.

However, somewhat higher \ntemperature values are noted for the transformers \nsubmerged in vegetable oil.\nThermal behavior of the hottest spot\nTo estimate the hottest spot temperature rise, direct \nmeasurement may be used, whose implementation is \nusually not viable because of the amount of sensors \nrequired and because of their installation during the \ntransformer manufacturing process. This investigation \nconducted thermal simulations by analyzing via finite \nelements to find higher temperature zones and then \ninstrument the transformer during its manufacture. \nFigure 6 shows the record of temperatures and \nFigure 7 shows the hot spot temperature rise obtained \nfrom different IEC and IEEE criteria.\nValues for hot-spot elevation (DqH/A,R) are below \nthe 80 °C specified by national and international \nstandards. Greater hot-spot elevations are found in \ntransformers submerged in vegetable oil; however, \nthe difference does not surpass 3 °C compared to \ntransformers submerged in mineral oil.\nTables 1 and 2 show the results of calculating the \nhot-spot elevation on oil by using IEC and IEEE \ncriteria. For IEC, we used an H=1.1 factor, for the \ncalculation we considered the higher temperature \nwinding (U-X). For IEEE, we calculated the \ntemperature average of the windings and added 15 °C \nto this value. The value from direct measurement \nwas obtained in the high-voltage winding.\nTwo-level simulated load\nThe thermal behavior of the transformers submerged \nin vegetable oil was also evaluated by using two-\nlevel load curves characterized by a preload and an \noverload during a 4-hour period. The preload was \nFigure 6.

Thermal behavior in the high-voltage \nwinding in the 37.5-kV A transformers \nfor a two-level load.\nUpon ending the overload, a maximum 72 °C \ntemperature value is present in the upper level of the \noil and of 81 °C in the winding for the transformer \nsubmerged in vegetable oil. It was noted the measured \ntemperature data are higher for the transformer \nsubmerged in vegetable oil. A difference of 4 °C \nwas noticed between maximum temperature values \nin oil and of 8 °C for the windings. These results \nshow that the temperature rise is greatest in the \ntransformers submerged in vegetable oil. In spite of \nthat, the temperature rises are within the nominal values \nsuggested by national and international standards\nNotwithstanding, to corroborate the normal operation \nfrom the dielectric point of view, it is necessary to \nrevise the design of transformers, given that the \nphysical, chemical, and dielectric properties of \nvegetable oil are different. The difference in the \nelectric constants of the mineral and vegetable oils \nlead to the electric field distributions not being the \nsame and perhaps the minimum distances required \nfor their normal operation are not fulfilled.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDistribution transformers immersed in vegetable oil \npresented greater temperature rises compared to those \nimmersed in mineral oil. The greatest temperature \ndifference does not surpass 10%. In spite of that, \nthe temperature rises are within the nominal values \nsuggested by national and international standards, \ntherefore may be stated that the distribution \ntransformers evaluated do not present inconveniences \nfrom the thermal point of view. \nThe results obtained are valid for the transformers \ntested; hence, it possible to have different results \nin other designs. Nevertheless, the distribution \ntransformers tested may be considered as typical \nin Colombia for being “cold transformers”.\nWe recommend submitting of transformers to \ndielectric tests like impulse voltage, applied voltage, \nand induced voltage.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank the Instituto Colombiano para el \nDesarrollo de la Ciencia y la Tecnología Francisco \nJosé De Caldas (COLCIENCIAS) and Empresas \nPúblicas de Medellín (EPM) for funding the project. \nLikewise, the authors thank RYMEL Ltd, Universidad \ndel Valle and NEOPTIX.\nREFERENCES \n[1] T.V .
