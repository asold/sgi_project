  "abstract": "Coordinated charging of Plug-In Electric Vehicles (PEVs) in residential distribution systems is a new concept currently being explored in the wake of smart grids. Utilities are exploring these options as there are concerns about potential stresses and network congestions that may occur with random and uncoordinated multiple domestic PEV charging activities. Such operations may lead to degraded power quality, poor voltage profiles, overloads in transformer and cables, increased power losses and overall a reduction in the reliability and economy of smart grids. Future smart grids communication network will play an important role in PEV operation because the battery chargers can be remotely coordinated by the utility and harnessed for storing surplus grid energy and reused to support the grid during peak times. Based on a recently proposed PEV charging algorithm, this paper focuses on the impact of coordinated charging on distribution transformer loading and performance. Simulation results are presented to explore the ability of the PEV coordination algorithm in reducing the stress on distribution transformers at different PEV penetration levels. The performance of various distribution transformers within the simulated smart grid is examined for a modified IEEE 23 kV distribution system connected to several low voltage residential networks populated with PEVs.",

INTRODUCTION \nThe present integration of Distributed Generation (DG) \nunits in power systems has many advantages, but also \nchallenges the performance of the old networks. One of these \nchallenges is to investigate the location and the penetration \nlevel of DG units which can easily be absorbed in the system \nwithout major structural changes while keeping all bus voltage \nlevels within permissible limits. Due to the high penetration of \nDG, voltage instability problems have become important \nissues in power systems. Most  studies confirm that 10-15 % \npenetration of DG can be absorbed in the electricity network \n[1]. It is well-known that high penetration levels of DG may \nhave significant impacts on voltage profile, grid loss, and \nvoltage stability margin. These impacts may appear either \npositively or negatively, depending on the type of distribution \nnetworks, nature of distributed generations and load \ncharacteristics.  \nIt seems reasonable to expect that the connection of DG to \nthe utility grid might improve the voltage profile and will \nenhance the voltage stability of a distribution system while \nreducing active and reactive losses [2].  Even though DG has a \nvariety of benefits, it also imposes some problems and \nlimitations.  \nThese problems become highly significant as the \npenetration level of DG increases and its impact will become \n                                                           \nParachai Juanuwattanakul, M.A.S. Masoum, Chittachai Niyomsak, and  \nMansour Mohseni are with the Department of Electrical and Computer \nEngineering, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia. (e-mail: \nparachai3@hotmail.com; m.masoum@curtin.edu.au; \nc.niyomsak@postgrad.curtin.edu.au; mansour.mohseni@curtin.edu.au). \nworse. This will eventually require static voltage stability \nanalysis (based on the power flow calculation) to ensure a \nproper and reliable operation of the power system with large \namounts of DG [3]. When the power system becomes stressed \n(e.g., as a result of load increasing), voltage instability can \neasily occur. This type of voltage instability mostly occurs at \nthe weakest bus [4].  Therefore, both the location and the \npenetration level of DG become a challenging task for system \nplanning and operation. Severa l methods to place DG units \nhave been proposed including voltage sensitivity analysis [5], \ncontinuation power flow for determination of the most \nsensitive bus to voltage collapse [7], voltage stability index \n[8], optimization approaches [8-9], voltage profile and loss \ncalculations [6, 11].  References  [9-10] show that the sizing \nand location of DG can significantly influence the voltage \nprofile and should be well planned to maintain the node \nvoltages within permissible limits. \nDetailed analyses of unbalanced/multiphase networks based \non continuation three-phase power flow show that the three \nPV curves on each phase for the unbalanced networks are \ndifferent [12-13]. Therefore, to determine the voltage stability \nmargins, the method of symmetrical components has been \napplied to merge the three PV curves to one PV curve based \non positive sequence voltage. In addition, to extend and \ngeneralize the conventional definition of bus voltage ranking \nindex for multiphase networks, symmetrical components are \nalso applied to the three-phase voltages resulting from three-\nphase power flow [14]. \nThis paper expands the well-known voltage index V/V\n0 for \nbalanced three-phase systems and defines an improved \npositive sequence voltage index of V\ncollapse/Vno-load to identify \nthe weakest buses in multiphase distribution networks. \nSimulation results are carried out for the IEEE multiphase 34 \nnode test feeder to determine the appropriate location and \npenetration level of DG in improving voltage profile, reducing \ngrid losses and increasing the maximum loading factor while \nkeeping all bus voltage levels within the permissible limits. \nSection II discusses the bus ranking for DG placement. \nSection III shows the impact of  DG placement. Section IV \npresents the test system.  Simulation results and analysis are \nprovided in Section V, followed by conclusion.   \nII.  B\nUS RANKING OF MULTIPHASE DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS \nThe approach taken in this study is utilizing the bus voltage \nranking index to identify the weakest buses in multiphase \ndistribution networks.

Impact of DG on Voltage Profiles \nIn balanced three-phase networks, voltage profiles are \nusually plotted using the average bus voltage values. For \nunbalanced networks, system unbalanced voltage variance \nindex [15] has been proposed for considering voltage profiles \ninstead of using system average voltage [16-17]. However, for \nmultiphase networks, voltage magnitudes in some phases are \nmissing. Therefore, in this pape r, the voltage profiles of all \nphases will be plotted in the range of 0.95-1.05 p.u. (see Figs. \n5 and 6). \nB.  Impact of DG on Grid Losses \nGrid losses associated with the placement and the \npenetration level of a DG unit (e .g., at the w eakest bus) are \ncomputed and compared w ith the losses without any \ncompensation device. Active power loss reduction (ALR) by \nDG units or compensation devices is calculated from:   \n 3\n                           ൌ\n௉೗೚ೞೞି௉೗೚ೞೞ\nವಸ\n௉೗೚ೞೞ\nൈ100%                        (14) \nWhere ௟௢௦௦\n஽ீ  and P୪୭ୱୱ are the total active power losses with \nand without DG units, respectively. \n The DG penetration level is defined as  \n                     ൌ\n௉ವಸ\n௉೗೚ೌ೏\nൈ100%             (15) \nwhere ஽ீ and ௟௢௔ௗ are the total active powers of the DG \nunits and system loads, respectively.  \nC.  Impact of DG on Maximum Loading Factor \nUsing a continuation three-phase power flow, PV curves for \nmultiphase distribution networks will be plotted. The method \nof symmetrical components will th en be applied to merge the \nthree individual PV curves into  a single PV curve based on \npositive sequence voltage. Finally, the maximum loading \nfactor (MLF) will be determined using the single PV curve \nbased on positive sequence voltage. MLF is defined as the \nratio of the maximum system load (at the voltage collapse \npoint) to the base load. \n \nFig. 2.  The IEEE multiphase 34 node test feeder [14]. \n \nIV.  SIMULATION RESULTS  \nFor the analysis of this paper, the IEEE multiphase 34 node \ntest feeder of Fig. 2 [18] is considered. The network has been \nsimulated using DIgSILENT PowerFactory software [19]. The \nsystem data is available in [18]. This unbalanced multiphase \nfeeder consists of three-phase and single-phase sections with \nunbalanced spot loads (Y-PQ, D-PQ, Y-I, D-I, Y-Z, and D-Z), \ndistributed loads (Y-PQ, Y-I, Y-Z, D-I, D-Z, and D-PQ), \nthree-phase shunt capacitors (at buses 844 and 848), and an in-\nline transformer (between buses 632 and 688). There are also \ntwo automatic voltage regulators.  \nBus 800 is treated as a slack bus with a voltage setpoint at \n1.05 p.u. At a base-case load condition, the voltage at bus 890 \nis lower than the permeable voltage limits because the line \nbetween buses 888 and 890 is relatively long. Other bus \nvoltages are in the permeable range of 0.95- 1.05 p.u. \n \nA.  Bus Voltage Ranking Based on the Proposed Index \nFigure 3 shows the bus voltage ranking for the base-case-\nload with two automatic voltage regulators which regulate the \nvoltage in the range of 0.95-1.05 p.u. According to this figure, \nthe four lowest VRI values are buses 890, 852, 864, and 822, \nrespectively. The weakest bus is still at bus 890.Therefore, the \nthree-phase weakest bus is bus 890 and this bus will be \nselected for the installation of DG units. \n \nFig. 3.  Bus ranking for base-case load. \n \nB.  Impacts of DG Units on Voltage Profile, Grid Loss, and \nMaximum Loading Factor \nA DFIG wind turbine with power factor control is installed \nat the weakest three-phase bus  (bus 890) and its size is \nchanged to determine its imp acts on loading factor, active \npower loss reduction, and voltage profile. \nSimulations results are presented in Fig. 4 indicating that \nactive power loss is lowest (ALR = 62.31%) at a DG \npenetration level 40% while the loading factor escalates as the \nDG penetration increases. \n \nFig. 4.  Loading factor and active power loss with different DG penetration at \nbus 890. \n \nHowever, with 40% DG penetration at bus 890, as identify \nby grid loss calculation, the voltage profile of all phases at bus \n890 is higher than the upper voltage limit of 1.05 p.u as shown \nin Fig.5. \n \n1.085\n1.058\n1.031\n1.004\n0.977\n0.950\n808\n810\n812\n814\n850\n816\n818\n824\n820\n822\n826\n858\n832\n852\n830\n828\n854\n856\n800\n864\n888\n890\n834\n842\n844\n846\n848\n860\n836\n840\n802\n862\n838\n806\nBus Number\nVoltage Profile [p.u.]\nLine-Ground Voltage, phase-a\nLine-Ground Voltage, phase-b\nLine-Ground Voltage, phase-c\n \nFig. 5.
