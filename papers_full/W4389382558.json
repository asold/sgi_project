I NTRODUCTION\nIntelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and promising technology that has emerged as a\nbreakthrough concept for enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems [1], [2].\nAn IRS is an array of passive reflecting elements that can manipulate the electromagnetic waves\nincident on it, allowing them to be steered, amplified, or attenuated [3], [4]. These reflecting ele-\nments can be individually controlled and configured to achieve specific communication objectives\nsuch as enhancing signal strength, coverage, and capacity [5], [6]. IRS has several advantages\nover traditional wireless communication systems. It is power-efficient and cost-effective as it uses\nonly passive elements and requires less hardware. To achieve better spectral efficiency (SE) and\nenergy efficiency (EE) via the deployment of the IRS, the active beamforming at the base station\n(BS) and the passive beamforming at the IRS are designed in [7]–[10]. However, this research\nis conducted under the implicit assumption that channel state information (CSI) is completely\nknown at the BS, which is not a practical assumption [11].\nIndependent estimation of channels from the BS to the IRS, and IRS to the user is practically\nchallenging due to the IRS’s limited signal processing capabilities. Instead, only the cascaded\nuser-IRS-BS channels can be predicted at the BS or user [12]. Moreover, it is important to\nconsider the channel training overhead incurred during the estimation of cascaded channels.\nThis training overhead consumes valuable system resources, such as bandwidth and power.\nConsequently, it has the potential to impact the overall EE and SE of the system. Thus, it is\ncrucial to strike a balance between the need for accurate channel estimation and the associated\ntraining overhead.\nIn [13], a binary reflection-controlled least-squares (LS) channel estimation scheme is introduced,\nwhich involves activating a single reflecting element while deactivating the rest within each time\nslot for channel estimation. In [14], a minimum variance unbiased channel estimator is proposed,\nwhich estimates the channel with all elements of the IRS switched on simultaneously. Further, a\nthree-phase LS channel estimation scheme is introduced in [15]. However, the estimation errors in\nthe two phases can propagate in the third phase of channel estimation, resulting in low estimation\naccuracy. A linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimator leverages prior knowledge\nPage 2 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n3\nof channel distributions is proposed in [16]. However, this method involves multidimensional\nintegration which is intractable in practice. In [17], a systematic pattern of pilot signals is\npresumed for channel estimation, and this approach leverages parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensor\nmodeling of the received signals. The authors in [18] introduced a convolutional deep residual\nnetwork (CDRN) for estimating cascaded channels in a multi-user scenario. This approach treats\nchannel estimation as a denoising task, improving the accuracy of cascaded channel estimates\nobtained from noisy LS estimation.\nThe aforementioned approaches estimate the cascaded channels for all the reflecting elements\nof an IRS simultaneously. As a consequence, they require longer pilot lengths that scale with\nthe number of reflecting elements, leading to significant pilot overhead. In [19] and [20], active\nelements are placed on the IRS to perform channel estimation. The estimated CSI from these\nactive elements is then utilized to predict the CSI from the remaining elements. In [19], the\northogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is used to recover full CSI. In [20], the LS estimate\nfrom active elements is treated like a low-resolution image, and a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) is trained to extract a high-resolution image. While these methods potentially reduce\ntraining overhead, they also lead to increased hardware complexity due to the inclusion of active\nelements within the IRS.\nSeveral studies present the channel estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery task [21], [22].\nThis method makes use of compressive sensing (CS) methods like OMP [23] and structured OMP\n[24] to estimate cascaded channels with fewer pilot symbols. Further, in [25] SOMP and CNN\nare combined to improve the channel estimation accuracy. In [26], the authors tackled the channel\nestimation challenge in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems by leveraging intrinsic low-\nrank properties through a two-phase algorithm, combining sparse matrix factorization and matrix\ncompletion techniques. In [27] and [28], the variational approximate message passing (V AMP)\nalgorithm is employed for estimating cascaded channels under the assumption of sparsity in\nthe angular domain and with the consideration of specific probability distributions. If these\nassumptions do not align well with the true characteristics of the channel, the performance of\nthe V AMP may be negatively affected, leading to less accurate channel estimation.\nTo address the high channel training overhead issue, the authors in [29] and [30] divide IRS\nelements into groups. Within each group, only the effective cascaded channel for all elements is\nestimated collectively. This approach significantly reduces the number of required pilot symbols,\nas the estimation is performed at the group level rather than for individual elements.

When we have access to only per-group effective channels,\nit becomes necessary to set the reflection coefficients identically for all elements within each\ngroup. This limitation curtails the design flexibility and restricts the available degrees of freedom\nfor passive beamforming.\nA. Motivation and contribution\nCurrent approaches for channel estimation in IRS systems have the shortcoming of usually\nnot taking into account the correlations among the channels of IRS elements, that arise due to\ntheir spatial proximity. By availing of the advantage of these correlations, we can potentially\ndecrease the pilot overhead for channel estimation. Furthermore, it’s worth highlighting that a\nreduction in channel estimation overhead can have a direct and significant impact on both EE\nand SE within the communication system. By decreasing the pilot overhead, valuable resources\nsuch as power can be conserved for the data transmission phase.\nIn this study, we initially partition the elements of the IRS into groups, drawing inspiration\nfrom grouping techniques described in the existing literature [29]. Pilot signals are transmitted\nto estimate cascaded channels for some of the groups, while for the rest of the groups, it is\nassumed that there exists some spatial correlation among the channels of the IRS elements as\nelements are aligned very close to each other. By exploiting this spatial proximity, the correlations\namong the channels of IRS groups are extracted to predict the channels for the next groups, thus\nsaving pilots and reducing the complexity of the channel estimation process.\nIn the areas of image processing and natural language processing (NLP), transformer models\nhave achieved amazing success [31], [32], and [33]. Their achievements in these domains have\npaved the way for exploring their application in the field of wireless communication, such as\naccurate time-varying channel estimation [34].\nWe are motivated by the capability of the transformer to capture correlations and dependencies\nin the data well. Thus, we exploit transformer models’ capability to capture the intricate connec-\ntions and relationships among the channels of the groups of IRS elements to perform channel\nestimation for unknown IRS groups. As a result, for the channels that have not previously been\nobserved, the model is able to successfully learn about them by taking knowledge from known\ngroups, producing precise predictions for IRS cascaded channels.\nIn the context of channel prediction for IRS, a transformer architecture is proposed for the\nPage 4 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n5\nfirst time to the best of our knowledge for predicting the channel response of the unknown\ngroup of IRS elements based on the channel responses of the known groups. The attention\nmechanism learns to assign different weights to the correlations among groups based on their\nrelevance to accurately predict the channels for the unknown groups. By attending to the most\nrelevant correlations, the attention mechanism helps in effectively capturing the spatial correlation\ninformation and incorporating it into the channel estimation process.\nWe make the following contribution to estimate cascaded channels in the IRS-aided communi-\ncation system:\n• Our proposed technique for predicting the cascaded channels, involves dividing the elements\nof IRS into groups based on their position. Then, use the LS method to estimate the channels\nfor some of these groups by transmitting pilot symbols. Leveraging the spatial correlation\namong the groups, we can estimate the channels for the remaining groups by utilizing the\nchannel information from the previously estimated groups. By employing this approach, it\nbecomes possible to achieve an accurate estimation of the channels of all IRS elements\nwhile simultaneously reducing the required number of pilot symbols.\n• To extract and utilize the correlation information among the groups, we adopt a graph\ntransformer-based approach. In this approach, the spatial relationship among groups is\nobtained by the embedding created by graph neural network (GNN) layers of the graph\ntransformer. Furthermore, we integrate the position information of each IRS group into the\ngraph embedding of each group.\n• The embedding concatenated with position information is the input to the attention layer\nof the graph transformer. The attention layer identifies the most relevant correlations for\npredicting the channel responses of unknown groups. By leveraging spatial correlations and\nposition relationships, the proposed method improves the accuracy of channel prediction\nby focusing on important groups. This enables efficient channel estimation in IRS systems\nwhile reducing the required pilot symbols.\n• Through extensive experimental evaluation, it has been shown that the proposed graph\ntransformer-based IRS cascaded channel estimation (G-TIRC) model, surpasses the exist-\ning methods in terms of channel estimation accuracy and significantly reduces the pilot\nsymbol overhead by leveraging spatial correlations and position information. Further, we\ndemonstrated the impact of reduced pilot overhead on the uplink SE and EE of the system.\nPage 5 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n6\nBlocked \nBS \nUser \nIRS \nFig. 1.

The BS is endowed with a B number\nof antennas and the user has a single antenna. The channel from the user to IRS is denoted as\nh ∈ CI×1. Further, the channel from IRS to the BS is given as F ∈ CB×I. The I elements of\nIRS are partitioned into P groups (I1, I2, .., IP ), each column represents one group as shown\nin Fig. 1. Each group consists of L = I/P elements. A time division duplex (TDD) protocol\nthat leverages the channel reciprocity principle to acquire the downlink CSI by utilizing uplink\nchannel estimation is considered.\nFor channel estimation of the p-th group, the user sends pilot symbols xp ∈ C1×τ with xpxT\np = 1\nto the BS, where τ ≥ L. At the BS, the received signal can be represented as:\nYp = Fpdiag(sp)hpxp + Np, (1)\nwhere Fp ∈ CB×L is the channel from the IRS to the BS and hp ∈ CL×1 is the channel from\nthe user to the IRS for the p-th group of the IRS elements. Np represents the additive white\nnoise, whose entries are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian has zero mean\nand unit variance. s = [ejφ1, .., ejφi, .., ejφI ]T , where φi is phase shift of i-th element. The vector\nsp ∈ CL×1 represents the phase shift of p-th group of IRS elements. It is obvious that diag(hp)sp\n= diag(sp)hp.

Then, we estimate the channels of some groups using (5). For simplicity,\nwe divide the groups column-wise as shown in Fig. 1 (the same color represents the element\ncorresponding to one group), and estimated the channels for starting P − P′ groups through\nLS as [ ˜G1, ˜G2, ...,˜GP−P′]. Our objective is to estimate the channels for the rest of the groups\n[GP−P′+1, ...,GP−2, GP−1, GP ] with the channel knowledge of aforementioned known groups.\nIII. G RAPH TRANSFORMER -BASED IRS CHANNEL ESTIMATION\nA. Embedding\nWe represent each group of IRS cascaded channels as a node of the graph. To extract the\ncorrelation information among groups, embeddings are created using GNN incorporated into the\ngraph transformer. The GNN updates the embedding of each group by layers of computation. The\noutput of the GNN is the final embedding, which provides us with the correlation information\nfor each group with respect to the other groups.\nThe GNN works by propagating messages between the nodes and aggregating them to update\nthe node embedding. Each layer of the GNN updates the node embedding using the information\nfrom the previous layer. As a result, the updated embeddings capture higher-level information\nabout the nodes and their correlations.\nFor the purpose of applying GNN to obtain embedding groups of IRS channels, the initial\nstep involves extracting the real and imaginary components of the LS estimate for each group\n[ ˜G\nLS\n1 , ˜G\nLS\n2 , ...,˜G\nLS\nP−P′], then each group is of the form ˜G\nLS\nP ∈ R2BL×1. The GNN consists of\nan input layer, that takes features from the IRS channel groups as initial representation vector\n˜G\n0\np = ˜G\nLS\np , p = 1, 2, 3, ..., P− P′. We then train one layer of fully connected (FC) layer to\nobtain ˜G\n1\np.\nIn the second layer, to obtain the embedding of the p-th group, we apply the aggregation\nand combination function to propagate the feature information from the corresponding and\nneighboring nodes.

The combination function is\nimplemented by the FC layer.\nFurther, we concatenate the position information of groups of the IRS to the graph embedding.\nThe final embedding E = [e 1, e2, ...,en] ∈ R(u\n′\n+3=u)×n, where u\n′\n+ 3 represents the feature\ndimension of embedding, where 3 represents the dimension of the location of the IRS group\nand n represents the number of groups to be embedded.\nAfter GNN embeds the channel information and calculates the correlation values among groups,\nthe attention mechanism comes into play. It assigns weights to the embeddings based on their\nrelevance and significance in the channel estimation process. This allows the attention mechanism\nto focus on the most informative correlations and ignore irrelevant or less important ones.\nB. Attention Mechanism\nThe attention mechanism in the G-TIRC model is crucial for capturing relevant information and\ndependencies among different groups of IRS elements’ channels. It applies a linear transformation\nto the embeddings, allowing the model to identify the relationships between the groups.\nBy assigning different weights to the groups through the attention mechanism, the model high-\nlights the importance of each group in predicting the channels for the unknown groups. This\nenables the model to focus on the most relevant correlations and extract useful information for\naccurate channel estimation.\nIn the attention mechanism, there are three types of vectors involved: query qi ∈ Rd×1, key\nki ∈ Rd×1, and value vi ∈ Ru×1. Here, d is the feature dimension of the key vector. The key,\nquery, and value vectors are given as:\nki = Θkei, i= 1, ..., n, (8)\nqi = Θqei, i= 1, ..., n, (9)\nvi = Θvei, i= 1, ..., n, (10)\nwhere Θk ∈ Rd×u, Θq ∈ Rd×u, and Θv ∈ Ru×u are the trainable weight matrix for key, query,\nand value, respectively. The matrix can be written as:\nK = ΘkE, (11)\nQ = ΘqE, (12)\nPage 9 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n10\nGNN\nConcatenation\nAttention Layer\nAdd & Normalize\nFully Connected Layer\nAdd & Normalize\nInput layer\nConcatenation\nMask Attention Layer\nAdd & Normalize\nFull Attention Layer\nAdd & Normalize\nFully Connected Layer\nAdd & Normalize\n0 \n0 \nEncoder\nDecoder\nPosition\nInformation of\nIRS groups\nPosition\nInformation of\nIRS groups\nFully Connected Layer\nZero padding\nFig. 2. Architecture of the G-TIRC model.\nV = ΘvE. (13)\nBy incorporating an attention mechanism, the model gains the capability to concentrate on the\nmost pertinent groups for predicting the channels of the unknown groups more accurately. The\nattention matrix A ∈ Rn×n is obtained by computing the product between the key matrix KT and\nthe query matrix Q. The softmax function is then applied to these scores to obtain a probability\ndistribution over the input. The attention matrix is denoted as:\nA = Softmax\n\u0012KT Q\n√\nd\n\u0013\n.

Graph transformer-based IRS channel estimation (G-TIRC) model\nFig. 2 illustrates the architecture of the G-TIRC model, which comprises an encoder and a\ndecoder component. The first two layers of the encoder are GNN layers that are integrated into\nthe transformer to obtain the embedding of the IRS channel groups. The GNN layers are followed\nby the concatenation layer that combines the position of IRS elements groups with the graph\nembedding. An attention layer is added after the concatenation layer that applies the attention\nPage 10 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n11\nmechanism to the embedding of known IRS channel groups to generate the key matrix K(e),\nquery matrix Q(e), and value matrix V(e) using three different linear transformations. Within the\nattention layer, the attention matrix A(e) is then calculated by applying the softmax function to\nthe dot product of the key matrix transposed KT\n(e) and the query matrix Q(e), scaled by the square\nroot of the dimension d.\nFinally, the output of the attention layer is obtained by taking a weighted sum of the value\nmatrix V(e) using the attention matrix A(e) as weights. The weighted sum is computed as a\nmatrix multiplication between the attention matrix and the value matrix.\nTo prevent the problem of vanishing gradients, residual connections, and layer normalization\nare added after the attention layer through the add and normalize layer of the encoder. The\nresidual connection allows the gradient to flow through the attention layer more easily, while\nlayer normalization helps to stabilize the activations of the layer. The output of the add and\nnormalize layer is given as:\nZ1\n(e) = NZ\n \nE(e) + V(e)Softmax\n \nKT\n(e)Q(e)\n√\nd\n!!\n, (16)\nThe output Z1\n(e) is passed to the FC layer. In the FC layer, we have the ReLU activation function.\nThe FC layer is followed by another add and normalize layer to obtain the final output Z2\n(e).\nIn the transformer decoder, the embeddings of known groups represented as e2, e3, ...,eP−P′,\nobtained from the encoder’s GNN, are fed to the input layer of the decoder. Additionally,\nzero padding groups are included in the input layer of the decoder to represent the channels\nof unknown groups. The mask attention mechanism is applied to the decoder’s embeddings,\ngenerating the key K(d), query Q(d), and value V(d). This mask attention ensures that the\ndecoder does not attend to the zero padding groups, focusing only on the known groups. To\nmask the last k groups from the input layer, we can create a mask matrix R of shape (n1, n1)\nwhere n1 is the number of the input groups, and set the last k rows of the mask matrix to −∞.\nThe mask matrix R can be expressed as follows\nRi,j =\n\n\n\n−∞ if i ≥ n1 − k + 1,\n1 otherwise.\n(17)\nThe output of the mask attention layer is given as defined:\nCmask = V(d)Softmax\n  \nKT\n(d)Q(d)\n√\nd\n!\nR\n!\n. (18)\nPage 11 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n12\nThe output from the attention layer, denoted as Cmask, is subsequently propagated through the\nadd and normalize layer. The output of this layer is given as:\nZ(d) = NZ(E(d) + Cmask). (19)\nThe output Z(d) and the output of the encoder Z2\n(e) is provided to the full attention layer of the\ndecoder. Different from the mask attention layer operations, in this layer, V and K matrix are\ncalculated based on encoder output Z(e) and Q is calculated by Z(d). Here, the full attention\nmechanism helps to establish the relationship between Z2\n(e) and Z(d) by multiplying the attention\nmatrix A and value matrix V. The next layer adds Z(d) to the output of the full attention layer,\nthen normalize it. The next layer is the FC layer, followed by the add and normalize layer to\ngenerate the output as:\n= NZ(Z + FC(Z)), (20)\nwhere Z = NZ(Z(d) +C). The final output of the decoder is obtained as bG = [bG2, bG3, ...,bGP−3,\nbGP−2, bGP−1, bGP ] by applying the FC layer at the end.\nTo train the transformer, the following loss function is minimized\nPP\np=2(Gp − bGp)\nPP\np=2 Gp\n, (21)\nwhere Gp is the ground truth of the cascaded channel and bGp is the cascaded channel of the p-th\ngroup estimated by the graph transformer. Further, the overall estimate of the cascaded channel\nis given as: bG = [ ˜G1, bG2, bG3, ...,bGP ].\nThe proposed framework consists of two phases: offline training and estimation phase. During\nthe offline training, the G-TIRC model is trained according to (21). To facilitate the train-\ning process, a training dataset is prepared, wherein each data point takes the following form:\n[ ˜G1, . . . ,˜GP−P′, G2, . . . ,GP ]. In this dataset, each data point consists of the set of LS channel\nestimates of the P − P′ groups, along with the corresponding ground truth values for these\ngroups. Additionally, the data point includes the ground truth of the remaining unknown groups.\nTo train the G-TIRC model, we leverage the true knowledge of the channel conditions. This\nknowledge helps in mitigating the errors that may have occurred during the LS estimation for\nsome groups. Only the estimation error related to the first group propagates through the training\nprocess since we do not employ the true values for this initial group during training. Once the\ntransformer is successfully trained, it refines the LS channel estimates for all the input groups.\nPage 12 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n13\nThis refinement is achieved via learned knowledge to enhance the accuracy of the channel\nestimates. During the estimation phase, the trained G-TIRC model is deployed to predict the\ncascaded channel based on the LS estimate of some groups.\nIV. E XPERIMENTAL SETTINGS AND RESULTS\nWe consider a communication system operating at a carrier frequency of 28 GHz, where B\n= 8, I = 32, L = 4, and P = 8. We choose n = 5, n1 = 7, and bandwidth (BW) = 50 MHz.\nThe location of the BS in the cartesian coordinate system is (100, 100, 0). The first group of\nIRS elements is at location (0, 0, 0). The separation between each element is ∆\n2 , where ∆ is the\ncarrier wavelength. The user is at the location (5, 35, -20). We assume channels from the user\nto the IRS and from the IRS to the BS consist of LoS and NLoS components. So, we model\nthe channels hp and Fp as Rician fading channel:\nhp = αp\n\u0012q ζuIp\nζuIp+1\n¯h\nL\np +\nq\n1\nζuIp+1\n˘h\nN\nL\np\n\u0013\n, (22)\nFp = βp\n s\nζIpB\nζIpB + 1\n¯Fp\nL\n+\ns\n1\nζIpB + 1\n˘Fp\nNL\n!\n, (23)\nwhere ζuIp and ζIpB represent the Rician factors of user-p -th group of IRS and p-th group of\nIRS-BS channel, respectively. Further, superscript L represents the LoS and NL represents the\nNLoS part of the channels. The path loss from the user to the p-th group of IRS elements and\nthe path loss from p-th group of IRS elements to the BS is denoted as αp = 30 + 22 log(ρuIp)\nand βp = 30 + 22 log(ρIpB), respectively [35]. The distances of the user-p-th group and p-th\ngroup-BS are denoted as ρuIp and ρIpB , respectively.\nThe LoS part of the channel hp is also a function of an angle of arrival (AoA) at the IRS. Thus,\nit is given as:\n¯hp\nL\n= aIRSp(θazi\np , θele\np ), (24)\nwhere θazi\np and θele\np denote azimuth AoA and elevation AoA at the p-th group of IRS, respectively.\nThe steering vector aIRSp(θazi\np , θele\np ) of the l-th element is given as:\n[aIRSp(θazi\np , θele\np )]i = ej π\n2 {i1(i)sin(θazi\np )cos(θazi\np )+i2(l)sin(θele\np )}, (25)\nwhere i1(l) = mod(l − 1, 10) and i2(l) = ⌊(l − 1)/10⌋. The location of the p-th group of IRS is\ndenoted as (ρISp\nx , ρISp\ny , ρISp\nz ) and the location of user is given as (ρu\nx, ρu\ny, ρu\nz ), we have:\nsin(θazi\np )cos(θele\np ) = ρu\ny − ρISp\ny\nρuIp\n, (26)\nPage 13 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n14\nTABLE I\nDETAILS FOR DATA GENERATION\nSymbol Parameters Values\nζIB Rician factor of IRS-BS 10\nζuI Rician factor of user-IRS 0\n(ρBS\nx , ρBS\ny , ρBS\nz ) location of BS (100, 100, 0)\n(ρ\nIpS\nx , ρ\nIpS\ny , ρ\nIpS\nz ) location of p-th group of IRS (0, 0, 0)\n(ρu\nx, ρu\ny , ρu\nz ) location of user (5, 35, -20)\nsin(θele\np ) = ρu\nz − ρISp\nz\nρuIp\n, (27)\nSimilarly, the LoS part of the channel Fp is given as:\n¯Fp\nL\n= aBS(ϕazi\np , ϕele\np )aH\nIRSp(ψazi\np , ψele\np ).

The azimuth\nAoD and elevation AoD from the p-th group of IRS are given as ψazi\np and ψele\np , respectively. We\nhave:\ncos(ψazi\np )cos(ψele\np ) = ρISp\nx − ρBS\nx\nρIpB\n.

Table I, illustrates the details of the various parameters\nfor data generation. A dataset consisting of 20,000 samples is created by performing experiments\nas per the channel and system settings mentioned above. From the 20,000 samples, a validation\nset and a testing set are created, each containing 4000 samples. To train the graph transformer,\nthe loss function described in (21) is minimized using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate\nof 0.002.\nWe assume that the IRS’s elements are very close to each other, and the phase shift of each\nelement is correlated [36]. To generate a correlated phase shift matrix for a 4x8 IRS rectangular\ngrid, we followed these steps:\nPage 14 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n15\n• Define the desired correlation matrix Υ(i, j) with size 32 × 32. This matrix represents the\ncorrelation among the phase shift values of each pair of IRS elements and can be computed\nusing a desired correlation function. One common choice is the exponential correlation\nfunction [37], which is given as Υ(i, j) = exp(− δ(i,j)\nλ ) where δ(i, j) is the Euclidean\ndistance between elements i and j, and λ is a parameter that controls the correlation. A\nlarger value of λ corresponds to a smoother correlation function, while a smaller value\ncorresponds to a more rapidly decaying function.\n• Compute the Cholesky decomposition of the correlation matrix Υ.\n• Compute the correlated phase shift values by multiplying the Cholesky factor Ψ with the\nuncorrelated phase shift vector φ. That is, s = Ψφ.\nA. Performance comparison\nThe normalized mean squared error (NMSE) is a performance metric used to evaluate the\nperformance of the G-TIRC method. It is defined as follows:\nNMSE = E∥bG − G∥2\nF\nE∥G∥2\nF\n, (31)\nwhere bG is the estimated cascaded channel matrix and G is the true cascaded channel matrix.\nTo analyze the impact of λ on the NMSE of channel estimation, we generated a plot depicting\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values against different values of λ, as shown in Fig. 3. This plot\nprovides a visual representation of how the correlation among the phase shift values of IRS\nelements influences the performance of channel estimation. The plot reveals that as λ increases\n(indicating a smoother correlation function), the NMSE tends to decrease as well. The reason\nbehind this observation is that a smoother correlation function fosters stronger coherence among\nIRS elements, resulting in a more accurate estimation of the channel. From Fig. 3, it is evident\nthat a λ = 0.8 yields minimized NMSE, indicating that it is well-suited for achieving optimal\nchannel estimation performance.\nTo showcase the efficacy of the G-TIRC method, a comparative analysis is conducted against the\nbenchmark schemes: Oracle-OMP and Oracle-LS [23]. Additionally, we compare the G-TIRC\nmethod with the following schemes:\n1) OMP [23]: By treating the channel as a sparse signal, we utilize the OMP algorithm to\nefficiently identify and recover the significant components of the channel.\nPage 15 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n16\n5 10 15 20 25\nSNR (dB)\n-12\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\nNMSE (dB)\n=0.8\n=0.6\n=0.4\n=0.2\nFig. 3.

The estimate obtained from SOMP is further given to CNN to improve estimation\naccuracy.\n4) LS and LMMSE [16]: Full rank cascaded channel estimates are obtained, sparsity is not\nassumed.\n5) CDRN [18]: LS estimate of the full rank-cascaded channels is an input to deep residual\nnetwork to predict the more accurate estimate of the cascaded channels.\nWe evaluate the performance of the G-TIRC method by analyzing the variation of the NMSE with\nrespect to the SNR. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 4, where we can observe that the\nNMSE decreases with an increase in the SNR. The decrease in NMSE with increasing SNR can\nbe attributed to the fact that a higher SNR results in a higher quality of the received signal. The\nreduced presence of noise in the received signal leads to more accurate channel estimation. The\nproposed G-TIRC method outperforms the other existing methods by achieving a significantly\nlower NMSE. Moreover, it performs closely to the oracle-OMP scheme with a gap of 1.5 dB at\nPage 16 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n17\n5 10 15 20 25\nSNR (dB)\n-14\n-12\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\nNMSE (dB) OMP\nSOMP\nSOMP+CNN\nLS\nLMMSE\nCDRN\nG-TIRC\nOracle-OMP\nOracle-LS\nFig. 4.

Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the number of pilots used in the channel\nestimation. As depicted in Fig. 6, the G-TIRC model requires fewer pilots than other existing\nmethods. The G-TIRC method gives -1 dB NMSE for pilot count = 16 and the CDRN method\ngives the same NMSE for a pilot count = 32. Moreover, to achieve -3 dB NMSE, LMMSE\nrequires 80 pilots but the G-TIRC achieves this NMSE with just 32 pilots. The pilot overhead\nreduction is 60% in comparison to LMMSE and 50% in comparison to the CDRN. This gain can\nbe attributed to the utilization of pilots for estimating the channel in some groups, while for the\nremaining groups, we exploit the correlation information obtained from the known groups. By\nleveraging the correlation among different groups, the G-TIRC model achieves accurate channel\nestimation with reduced pilot overhead. The ability to estimate the channel for multiple groups\nbased on the correlation information from a subset of known groups allows us to effectively\nutilize the available resources and minimize the number of required pilots.\nTo evaluate the robustness of our method, we perform experiments by varying the SNR values\nin the test dataset while keeping the SNR value in the training dataset fixed. Fig. 7 clearly\ndemonstrates that when there is a substantial disparity between the training and testing SNR, our\nproposed method exhibits higher NMSE compared to scenarios where the training and testing\nPage 18 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n19\n5 10 15 20 25 30\nTesting SNR (dB)\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\nNMSE (dB)\nTrain at SNR =10dB\n Train at SNR =20dB\nTrain at SNR=5dB, 10dB, 15dB, 20dB\nFig. 7.

To enhance the robustness of our method, we introduce mixed SNR\nvalues in the training dataset. As depicted in the figure, when the training dataset contains a\nmixture of SNRs, our proposed method demonstrates consistent and resilient performance across\ndifferent SNR values. This indicates that by training on a diverse range of system settings, the G-\nTIRC model becomes more adaptable and capable of handling variations in SNR during testing,\nthus improving its overall robustness.\nTo depict the generalizability of the proposed model in different channel conditions, we calculate\nNMSE for different Rician factors (ζ = ζuI = ζIB ). A higher Rician factor signifies a stronger LoS\ncomponent relative to NLoS components. In Fig. 8, we observe that in NLoS scenarios, traditional\nLS and LMMSE estimators tend to perform poorly. The complexity of NLoS channels poses\nchallenges for these conventional methods. In contrast, deep learning-based methods, CDRN,\nSOMP+CNN, and G-TIRC methods demonstrate fair performance in NLoS scenarios. This is\ndue to their skill to learn the complicated structure of the channel. Furthermore, the G-TIRC\nmethod consistently gives the least NMSE even in challenging NLoS conditions.\nB. System-Level performance\nDuring the data transmission phase, the received signal at the BS is given as:\ny = √\nηGsxd + nd, (32)\nwhere xd is the transmitted signal from the user and nd ∼ CN (0, σ2).

We conducted a study to assess the influence of our proposed channel estimation\nscheme, which incorporates reduced pilot overhead, on both the uplink SE and EE of the system.\nInitially, the channel estimates derived from our novel scheme are employed to optimize the\nbeamforming of the IRS, as outlined in [13]. Subsequently, data transmission takes place. It is\nimportant to note that the overhead associated with channel estimation does have an impact on\nSE and EE, as detailed in (33) and (34).\nIn Fig. 9, we examine the SE while varying the number of IRS elements, across different channel\nestimation schemes for fixed transmitting SNR = 20 dB. The SE initially increases with a growing\nnumber of IRS elements for all schemes. However, there exists a point at which the SE reaches\nits maximum value. Beyond this point, further increments in I lead to a decline in SE for LS,\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nI\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17SE (bits/sec/Hz)\nLS\nLMMSE\nOMP\nSOMP\nSOMP+CNN\nCDRN\nG-TIRC\nOracle-OMP\nOracle-LS\nFig. 9.

This decline in SE is primarily due to the increasing channel\nestimation overhead as I rises, negatively impacting the system’s overall performance. Notably,\nthe G-TIRC method, designed to work with reduced pilot overhead, maintains its efficiency even\nwith an increased number of IRS elements.\nIn Fig. 10, we compare the EE of the system, with the reduced pilot overhead required by\nthe G-TIRC method, with other methods.

Given the constraint of limited\npower at the user end, it becomes important to strike a delicate balance between the allocation\nof power for pilot signals and data transmission. When a higher number of pilots are engaged\nfor channel estimation, a significant portion of the available power is channeled into the pilot\ntransmission. Consequently, the power allocated for data transmission becomes restricted. This\nlimitation directly impacts SE and ultimately influences the overall EE of the system. In Fig. 11,\nwe depict the bit error rate (BER) attained by the IRS-assisted system employing binary phase-\nshift keying (BPSK) signaling, plotted against the SNR. In the context of channel estimation\nerrors, the G-TIRC method outperforms the CDRN method, demanding 5 dB less SNR to achieve\nan approximate BER of 10−4. This observation aligns with our earlier findings from the NMSE\nanalysis, where we demonstrated that the G-TIRC estimates consistently yield a lower NMSE.\nC.

The complexity in obtaining A is O(udn) and then to obtain C is\nO(un2). It is important to highlight that the dimension d is carefully configured to ensure\nconsistency with the dimension n. Thus, overall complexity from the attention layer is reduced\nto O(u2n) + O(un2). The operation in the FC layer adds complexity in order of O(u2n). Thus,\nthe overall complexity of the encoder can be approximated as O(u2n) + O(un2) + O(ndel).\nThe mask attention layer utilized in the decoder exhibits a similar level of computational intensity\nas the full attention layer employed in the encoder. It is denoted as O(u2n1)+ O(un12), where n1\nis the number of groups that are given as input to the decoder. The complexity of the full attention\nlayer of the decoder is O(u2n1) + O(u2n) + O(un1n). The complexity of the decoder can be\nrefined as O(u2n1)+O(un12)+O(un1n)+O(u2n). The overall complexity of the proposed model\ncan be rewritten as O(u2n) +O(un2) +O(u2n1) +O(un1n) +O(ndl). Since the input to the G-\nTIRC is ˜Gp ∈ R2BL×1, the complexity can be rewritten as:O(B2L2n)+O(BLn2)+O(B2L2n1)+\nO(BLnn1)+ O(BLnl), which can be further summarized to O(B2L2n1)+ O(BLn2) as n1 > n.\nThe time complexity of the proposed method is further compared in Table II with other methods.\nPage 23 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n24\nTABLE II\nCOMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF DIFFERENT METHODS\nModel Computational Complexity Estimation time (milliseconds)\nLS O(BIlog2(BI)) 42\nMMSE O(B3(I + 1)3) 97\nSOMP and OMP O(BI2It)⋆ 71\nSOMP+CNN O(BI2It) +O\n\u0010\nBI PNc\nc=1 nc−1 · f2\nl · nc\n\u0011\n⋆⋆ 151\nCDRN O\n\u0010\nBI PNc\nc=1 nc−1 · f2\nl · nc\n\u0011\n90\nG-TIRC O(B2L2n1) +O(BLn2) 82\n⋆ It is the number of iterations.\n⋆⋆ Here, fl is the spatial size of the filter of the c-th Conv layer, c ∈ {1,2, .., Nc} and nc represents\nthe channels of neural network.\nTo simplify the comparison we compare the estimation time of each method.

It is noted, that the\ncomputational complexity of the G-TIRC is lower than the MMSE, CDRN, and SOMP+CNN\napproaches. The computational complexity of the proposed method is lower than LMMSE,\nCDRN, and SOMP+CNN. The complexity of CDRN and SOMP+CNN increases due to multiple\nconvolutional layers, each involving numerous additions and multiplications in their operations.\nThe estimation time of the proposed channel estimator is a little higher than the OMP and LS\nestimators. However, the estimation time can be greatly reduced by deploying a high-computing\nGPU at the BS.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a novel technique for channel estimation in IRS-governed communication\nsystems is proposed. We have successfully addressed the challenge of achieving accurate channel\nestimation while reducing the training overhead associated with IRS elements by partitioning\nthe IRS elements into groups and leveraging the spatial correlations among them. Through the\nuse of group-based channel estimation, we are able to estimate the channel response of the\nentire IRS using a reduced number of pilot symbols. The proposed technique incorporates a\ngraph transformer, in which GNN layers extract valuable correlation information among groups.\nFurther, the attention layer of the graph transformer effectively extracts the important correlations\namong different groups, to predict the channel of unknown groups, enabling more accurate and\nPage 24 of 27\nIEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking\nUnder review for possible publication in\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n25\nreliable channel prediction.
