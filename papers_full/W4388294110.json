    "abstract": "Purpose: Localization and screening of the target tissue is a main prerequisite of numerous medical procedures, including capsule endoscopy, colonoscopy and histology. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), by stacking convolutional, down-sampling, and up-sampling operators in an encoder-decoder fashion, were the de-facto standard and has shown great promise in recent years. The main deficiency of these models is their local convolutional operators, which degrade accuracy, especially for targets with long-range dependencies. While CNNs excel at local feature extraction, Transformers are known for their ability to capture long-range dependencies. Also, CNN-Transformer models employ complex attention mechanisms for fusion that could increase model complexity and the potential for overfitting and underfitting in many datasets. Methods: In this paper, we propose an efficient context-aware CNN-Transformer fusion mechanism based on Semi-supervised Spatial and Global Attention mechanism (SSG-Att). Our model is designed to combine the strengths of both models and overcome their limitations. High-level features that are extracted from the two parallel branches are combined and fused using the proposed SSG-Att mechanism. A hybrid loss function is also employed, which is better adapted to the introduced fusion system. Results: We evaluated the performance of our proposed model on the Kvasir-SEG, a polyp segmentation and detection dataset, and the Gland segmentation dataset. The experimental results confirmed that the improvements yield a top-performing yet efficient deep fused CNN-Transformer architecture. The proposed model outperformed the best-reported accuracies, achieving improved dice scores of 92.11 ± 1.10 % and 91.16 ± 0.81 on the Kvasir-SEG and GlaS datasets, respectively. Conclusion: We concluded that the proposed context-aware fusion mechanism has the potential to be used in screening and localization applications in a more reliable and accurate operation compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",
