Traditions begin as innovations by one or a few\nindividuals and are then inherited through social learning\nmechanisms (Fragaszy & Perry,2003). Traditions are not\nspecies-speciﬁc patterns of behaviour; rather, their occur-\nrence is generally limited to a few, isolated subpopulations,\nmaking their distribution fragmented and their persistence\nhighly vulnerable to human impact (van Schaik,2002).\nBurmese long-tailed macaquesMacaca fascicularis aurea\nmaintain stone-hammering traditions along the coasts and\nmangroves of Thailand and Myanmar (Carpenter, 1887;\nMalaivijitnond et al., 2007). Their tool use is primarily a\ncoastal foraging adaptation, as tool use is not known to\noccur away from coastal habitats. Consequently, conserved\ncoastal areas are a prerequisite for maintaining these rare\nmacaque tool traditions. Macaca fascicularis fascicularis,\nwhich is widely distributed in Indonesia and Malaysia, is\ncategorized as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List butM.\nfascicularis aurea is categorized as Data Deﬁcient (Ong &\nRichardson, 2008).\nStone-using macaques are rare. They have a limited\ndistribution in Thailand, in only seven locations\n(Malaivijitnond et al.,2007; YouTube,2008; Gumert et al.,\n2009, 2010). The most observable tool use occurs at Piak\nNam Yai Island, in Laem Son National Park, Ranong, and\nKoram Island in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Prachuab\nKhiri Khan. Koram is highly disturbed by tourist activity\nbut Piak Nam Yai is more pristine and less disturbed.\nIn Myanmar stone use was reported .120 years ago\n(Carpenter, 1887) but a nationwide survey in2004– 2009 did\nnot report any stone-using populations (San & Hamada,\n2011). However, during this survey there was no speciﬁc\nintent to look for tool use. In 2011 a local guide in\nKawthaung claimed the behaviour still occurred in the\nsouthern parts of the Mergui Archipelago (pers. comm. to\nMDG), suggesting further investigation is needed.\nThe stone-using habits of Burmese long-tailed macaques\nmake them part of a rare class of extant primates that exhibit\ncustomary stone-hammering traditions, which also includes\nwestern chimpanzeesPan troglodytes verusin West Africa\nand bearded capuchinsCebus libidinosusin Brazil (Haslam\net al.,2009). Other than these few primates only sea otters\nEnhydra lutris regularly use stone tools, although various\nMICHAEL D.

Animal populations\nthat exhibit stone tool-use are rare, and consequently these\ntraditions are vulnerable to being extinguished by human\nactivity.\nMuch of the wildlife in South-east Asia is experiencing\npressure caused by rapid development and high rates of\ndeforestation (Achard et al.,2002). Forest loss has led to a\nrisk of extinction for a large proportion of the region’s\nbiodiversity (Sodhi et al.,2004) and is also a major driver of\nincreasing human– wildlife conﬂict (Woodroﬀe et al.,2005).\nConﬂict with wildlife in South-east Asia now involves\nnumerous species, including elephants Elephas maximus,\ntigers Panthera tigris(Nyhus & Tilson,2004), pigsSus scrofa\n(Linkie et al., 2007), sun bears Helarctos malayanus\n(Fredriksson, 2005) and several primate species (particu-\nlarly Macaca spp.; Linkie et al.,2007; Riley,2007; Gumert,\n2011).\nHuman and long-tailed macaque populations overlap\nsubstantially and this may be the most widespread human–\nwildlife conﬂict occurring in South-east Asia (Eudey,2008;\nGumert, 2011). Human – macaque con ﬂict is causing a\nreduction in long-tailed macaque populations through an\nincrease in programmes to reduce their numbers (e.g.\nsterilization and culling) and systematic wild capture to\ncollect live animals for trade (Eudey,2008; Hasan & Feeroz,\n2010; Gumert,2011). Control programmes are the result of\nincreasing public complaints about macaques as pests,\nwhich are ultimately the result of an increase in degree of\nspace shared between humans and macaques (Sha et al.,\n2009). The activities of humans (Gumert et al.,2011) and\ntheir domesticated animals, such as dogsCanis familiaris\n(Anderson, 1986), put pressure on long-tailed macaques,\naltering their survivorship and behaviour; this is particularly\nproblematic for small populations (Afendi et al., 2011).\nFurthermore, anthropogenic impacts alter the species ’\necology, increasing reliance on anthropogenic food re-\nsources, and some individuals have become completely\nseparated from natural habitats (Fuentes et al., 2005;\nMalaivijitnond et al., 2011). Such adjustments to anthro-\npogenic inﬂuence can change the wild foraging strategies of\nmacaques, and this could potentially extinguish naturally\noccurring traditions such as tool use.\nThe tool-using long-tailed macaques in Laem Son\nNational Park are facing the potential eﬀects of increasing\nhuman activities. We need to understand the degree of\noverlap of these macaques with humans and their domestic\nanimals, how this aﬀects their survival, and whether it will\nimpact their rare stone-using traditions. We have observed\nlong-tailed macaques on Piak Nam Yai since 2005 and\nconducted a detailed census in 2011. We identiﬁed their\ngrouping patterns, distribution, and population size, and\nobserved anthropogenic impacts on the island and assessed\nhow these factors are aﬀecting the macaques.\nStudy area\nLaem Son National Park is a marine national park on the\nwestern seaboard of Thailand. It protects parts of the\nAndaman Sea and surrounding bays, islands, and coastal\nareas (Fig. 1). The park was established in1983 and covers\n315 km\n2, of which267 km2 is open sea (Faculty of Forestry,\n1987). The Park protects60 km of coastline and15 islands,\nwith 14 km2 of its area being mangrove forest comprising\npredominantly Rhizophora apiculata (DNP, 2006). These\nmangroves are of high conservation concern and part of\na protection programme under the Ramsar Convention\n(Royal Forest Department, 2002). Other habitats include\nsandy beaches, mudﬂats, rocky shores, tropical rainforest\nand coastalCasuarina equisetifoliaforests (DNP,2006).\nOf the 15 islands in the Park, long-tailed macaques\ninhabit only Piak Nam Yai and Thao Islands. The macaques\non both of these islands use stone tools, are completely wild,\nand ﬂee from approaching humans (Malaivijitnond et al.,\n2007). We chose Piak Nam Yai for our study because the\nmacaques and their tool use are more easily observable\nthere.\nPiak Nam Yai is a small island with an area of1.7 km2 and\n5.4 km of coast (Fig. 2). The island contains mountainous\ntropical forest interlaced with freshwater streams. The coast\nis predominantly rocky shore but there is a large mangrove\narea and a small stretch of sandy beach. Between the\nmangrove and beach is a lowland grass area intermixed with\nsparse Casuarina groves.\nIn December2004 the Indian Ocean tsunami that struck\nBanda Aceh, Phuket, Phang Nga and other regions of Asia,\nIndia and Africa, also struck Laem Son National Park and\nthe surrounding villages (USAID,2005; Kendall et al.,2010).\nBased on local reports no one in the nearest village,\nBang Ben, was killed, but most structures were demolished\nand numerous livestock were lost. Reconstruction occurred\nquickly, supported by international and Thai charities\n(USAID, 2005). During reconstruction in2006 a bridge was\nbuilt that leads to a pier on Piak Nam Noi Island, a small\nisland 100 m from Piak Nam Yai (Fig. 2). Laem Son National\nPark does not restrict access to this new bridge and pier,\nlabelling it a free access area, and thus it has become a point\nof free entry into the Park for the local community and\nvisitors. This has increased access to and use of the Park.\nMethods\nSurveys were conducted by boat around Piak Nam Yai\nbetween 15 January and9 June 2011. We conducted surveys\non 89 days, for an average of5 hours per day. Each survey\nwas tracked using a global positioning system (GPS), which\ncollected positional data every30 seconds. Circuits of the\nisland were always completed so that every part of the coast\nwas surveyed.\n536 M. D. Gumert et al.\n© 2013 Fauna & Flora International,Oryx, 47(4), 535–543\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0030605312000130 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nWe circumnavigated the island until macaques were\nsighted, and then stopped and noted the position of the\nboat. If visible, the macaques were observed from a distance\nof 10– 60 m, and counted. In addition, we identiﬁed indi-\nviduals using observation and photography. A macaque was\nconsidered identiﬁed after unambiguous recognition of an\nindividual by the researcher over several days. We also\nrecorded whether each individual was ever observed using\na tool.\nIdentiﬁcations were used to determine groups and to\ncount individuals. The total population was determined\nusing the counts of identiﬁed individuals, plus estimated\ncounts of the few unidentiﬁed individuals, which were based\non head counts. The coastal range of each group was\ndetermined from the GPS data. We calculated the\nproportion of the population that used tools, and tested if\ngroup size was related to the length of coastal range used by\ngroups and number of times sighted, using the Spearman\nrank correlation coeﬃcient (ρ). Statistics were calculated\nwith SPSS v.19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).\nOur census method assumed that all macaques living on\nPiak Nam Yai must regularly come to the coast. This is a\nreasonable assumption. Firstly, long-tailed macaques are an\nedge species and reliably come to forest edges (Gumert,\n2011). Secondly, macaque home ranges can be equivalent to\nthe entire area of Piak Nam Yai (Fooden,1995), and thus it is\nFIG. 1 Laem Son National Park (LSNP)\nis a marine national park along the\nwestern coast of Thailand.

Lastly, on a small island the coast probably plays a\nhighly important role in the macaques’ diet (Gumert et al.,\n2009).\nWe recorded any types of anthropogenic impact\nobserved on Piak Nam Yai during this study and during\nshorter studies conducted since 2005 (29 January–\n2 February, 23– 25 March 2005; 1– 5 December 2007;\n27 February– 1 March, 3– 23 June, 10– 20 December 2008;\n5– 21 December 2009; 7– 12 December 2011). We quantiﬁed\naspects of this impact. Firstly, all groups were categorized\nas either having high or low overlap with human activity;\nhigh overlap was de ﬁned as .20% of the group ’s\nrange overlapping with farm plots and forest clearing.\nSecondly, we recorded the location of dogs, with a GPS, and\nrecorded any dog– macaque interactions. We measured the\ndegree to which a macaque group overlapped with dog\nactivity by calculating a dog intensity score, using:\nDIgr 5(Dgr/Rgr)× 100, whereD is number of dog sightings\nin the range of a group,R is length of coastal range of group,\ngr is group, andDI is intensity of dog activity. This score\nprovided a measure of dog activity that accounted for the\neﬀect of range size on the likelihood of dog – macaque\nencounters.\nWe studied the eﬀects of anthropogenic impact on group\ncomposition and coastal usage by comparing groups that\nhad low and high overlap with human and dog activity.\nWe also tested the relationship between group composition\nand diﬀering levels of dog activity. We used Mann– Whitney\nU tests for the comparisons and Spearman ’s rank\ncorrelation coeﬃcient to test the relationship.\nResults\nPopulation census\nWe made248 circumnavigations of Piak Nam Yai over89\ndays, averaging2.79 (range 1– 5) circuits per day. We sighted\nmacaques on the coast462 times (Table 1), averaging 1.86\nsightings per circuit (range 0– 6 groups per circuit). We\nfound that macaque sightings were almost continuously\ndistributed along the coastal region of Piak Nam Yai (Fig. 2)\nexcept for the sandy beach and northern mangrove. Both of\nthese zones are open areas on opposite coasts (i.e. east and\nwest), adjacent to farming plots where people frequently\nwork (Fig. 2). Macaques had been observed in these zones in\n2007 and 2008 (MDG pers. obs.), when human activity was\nless frequent.\nAll adult and adolescent animals that came to the coastal\nareas were identiﬁed and logged. In June2011 there were\n143 identiﬁed individuals (52 adult females,25 adult males,\n12 adolescent females,18 adolescent males, and36 juveniles),\nplus a head count of24 juveniles and25 infants that were not\nindividually recognizable, bringing the total population\ncount to192 individuals (Table 1). Observations of tool use\nindicated that at least88% of the adults and adolescents,58%\nof the population, used tools. The latterﬁgure could be an\nunderestimate because we could not reliably count tool use\nin unidentiﬁed juveniles.\nWe identiﬁed nine groups (Fig. 2). They were highly\nvariable in size (8– 35 individuals), in the length of coastline\nthey utilized (500– 1,350 m), and in the number of times we\nsighted them on the coast (14– 116; Table 1). The range of\ns\nFIG. 2 Piak Nam Yai, Piak Nam Noi,\nand Thao Islands lie within1.5 km of the\nmainland. The thick land border\nindicates shores above sea level and the\nthin intertidal border indicates intertidal\nmangroves and sandy shores.

There was a potentially\npositive but non-sign ﬁcant relationship between group\nsize and the number of times a group was sighted on the\ncoast (n59, ρ 50.580,P 50.102).\nAnthropogenic impacts\nAfter the 2004 tsunami, development occurred in many\nareas of Laem Son National Park, including Piak Nam Yai.\nAlthough no people yet live permanently on Piak Nam Yai,\nwe observed an expansion of anthropogenic impact. The\nmost signiﬁcant impact has been land conversion to rubber\ntree Hevea brasiliensis, oil palm Elaeis guineensis, and\ncoconut Cocos nuciferaplantations on the northern part of\nthe island (Fig. 2). The rubber and oil palm farms are\nparticularly damaging because forest and hillsides are clear-\ncut to plant saplings. A small day camp for plantation\nworkers was built (Fig. 2), which consists of small houses,\nbungalows, a water well, and fencing. In addition, a variety\nof vegetable crops have been planted around the settlement.\nThere are several other human impacts on Piak Nam Yai.\nDomestic dogs were observed on the coasts, mainly near the\nplantations (Fig. 2). Several hundred metres of water piping\nwere left along the eastern shores and mangroves after a\nfailed attempt to extract fresh water from the streams during\npost-tsunami reconstruction. We observed collection of\noysters, clams and cockles along the shores and mudﬂats,\nand high levels of net ﬁshing around the shores. In the\nforests we observed opportunistic logging, metal binding of\nfruit trees (e.g. bitter beanParkia speciosa) to prevent wild\nanimals ascending, and the redirection of streams using\ncanals. On three occasions we also found dead or injured\nmacaques near the plantations.\nTo assess if human activity was a ﬀecting macaque\nmortality we compared the composition of juveniles and\ninfants across groups with respect to high (n54 groups)\nand low (n 55) overlap with the farms ( Table 1).\nHigh-overlap groups had signiﬁcantly fewer juveniles and\ninfants (M 50.33,S D50.14, range0.13– 0.43) than groups\nwith low overlap (M 50.51,S D 50.02, range 0.50– 0.54;\nMann– Whitney U Test: U 50.00,Z 5−2.460,P 50.012;\nFig. 3). High-overlap groups were potentially sighted\nless often on the coasts ( M 531.75 times, SD 518.25,\nrange 14– 57) than low-overlap groups (M 567.00 times,\nSD 535.71, range 25– 116) but the di ﬀerence was not\nsigniﬁcant (Mann– Whitney U Test: U 53.5, Z 5−1.599,\nP 50.110; Fig. 3).\nThe most obvious daily impact on the macaques was\nfrom six identiﬁed domestic dogs that we observed a total of\n47 times on the shores (Fig. 2).

The dogs thus\ndisplaced macaques in 14 out of 15 (93.3%) interactions,\ncausing them toﬂee and alarm call, indicating that dogs are\na major deterrent for macaques using the coast.\nThe largest number (n527) of dog sightings occurred in\nthe range of the northernmost group, BC (Fig. 2, Table 1).\nWe ﬁrst began to regularly observe dogs in the BC range\nin 2009 and since then we have not observed juvenile (age\n1– 3 years) macaques in the group. We observed at least six\njuveniles in the group in December2007 and seven juveniles\nand three infants (age 0– 1 year) in December 2008.\nIn December 2009 we found no infants or juveniles. In\nNovember 2010, one infant was observed but, in January\n2011, it had not survived, and no juveniles or infants were\nobserved. During our census, three infants were born into\nthe group and one disappeared at8 weeks of age. The other\ntwo were still surviving at the end of the census in June2011\nbut were absent in December2011.\nTo assess the possible impact of hunting dogs on juvenile\nmortality we analysed how the degree of overlap with dogs\nrelated to group composition. We calculated the intensity\nof dog activity in each group ’s range ( Table 1), and\nthen correlated each group’s dog-intensity measure with\njuvenile– infant composition. We found a signi ﬁcant\nnegative correlation between intensity of dog activity and\njuvenile– infant composition (n59, ρ 5−0.698,P ,0.037;\nFig. 4). Although we never witnessed a dog killing a\nmacaque, the data on group composition shows that where\ndog– macaque overlap was highest the proportion of young\nmacaques was much lower, suggesting predation.\nDiscussion\nPiak Nam Yai is a protected island in Thailand’s marine\nnational park system. It is unique because it contains the\nmost conspicuous and regularly observable stone-tool use of\nany currently known wild long-tailed macaque population.\nThere are many areas on the mainland coast near Piak\nNam Yai with a similar ecology but we have not observed\nextensive coastal use or regular tool-based foraging by\nmacaques there. These mainland coastal areas are sur-\nrounded by farms and roads and have been aﬀected by\nregular activities of people and their domesticated animals\n(i.e. dogs and buﬀalo Bubalus bubalis). These anthropogenic\ninﬂuences may inhibit usage of these areas by macaques. In\nour study we found that human activity negatively aﬀects\ntool-using macaques by limiting their usage of the coast and\nthe proportion of young in their groups. If these impacts\ncontinue the macaque population on Piak Nam Yai could\ndecrease, be displaced from the shores, and have their\nforaging strategies altered, all of which could disrupt the\npersistence of their stone-using tradition.\nSigniﬁcant anthropogenic changes in an animal ’s\nenvironment can alter its dietary habits, foraging strategies,\nand movement (Sutherland, 1998; Ditchkoﬀ et al., 2006),\nand the introduction of dogs can aﬀect habitat use through\nharassment and predation (Anderson, 1986; de Oliveira\net al.,2008). On Piak Nam Yai human impact is altering the\nisland’s ecosystems and the foods available to macaques.\nDevelopment for farmland is clearing large portions of\nforest, harvesting of bivalves is reducing the amount\navailable to macaques, and dogs are repelling macaques\n*\n*\nHigh HighLowLow\nMean no. of sightings ± SE\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nProportion of juveniles + infants ± SE\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nFIG.3 D iﬀerences between groups with low and high overlap\nwith farms in the proportion of juveniles + infants and number\nof sightings on the coast.

If these\nchanges continue the macaques could alter their foraging\nstrategies, possibly limiting further development of their\ncoastal stone-using traditions.\nCercopithecine primates, such as baboons Papio spp.\n(Maples et al.,1976; Altmann & Muruthi,1988; Hill,2000),\nvervets Chlorocebus spp. (Else, 1991) and macaques\n(Southwick & Siddiqi, 1994; Fuentes et al., 2005, 2007;\nRiley, 2007) are particularly a ﬀected by anthropogenic\nimpacts and will signiﬁcantly change their behaviour where\nthey are aﬀected. Their ability to adjust appears adaptive\nbecause after shifting from wild foraging patterns to\nsynanthropy (i.e. tolerance and dependence on humans),\npopulations of savannah baboons Papio cynocephalus\n(Altmann & Muruthi, 1988), rhesus macaques Macaca\nmulatta (Southwick & Siddiqi, 1977) and long-tailed\nmacaques (Brotcorne et al., 2011) regularly rebound with\npopulation increases. Thisﬂexibility allows them to avoid\nlocal extinction and thrive in human-altered environments\nbut at the cost of losing their wild behaviour.\nTraditions are particularly vulnerable to environmental\ndisturbances. The ‘fragility of traditions’ hypothesis (van\nSchaik, 2002) predicts that sustained disruptions from\nhuman activity can extinguish animal traditions. The\nthreats we observed at Piak Nam Yai are continuing and\nhave the potential to inhibit the development and cross-\ngenerational transmission of stone-use, if not controlled.\nWe found that young macaques have a higher mortality\nrate around humans and domesticated animals, and this\nleaves fewer developing individuals to learn traditions.\nAdditionally, harassment by domestic dogs lessens the time\nmacaques spend on the shores, increases their need to\nbe vigilant, and reduces attention to learning complex tool-\nusing patterns.\nThe human activities aﬀecting macaques in Laem Son\nNational Park are illegal according to Thailand ’s 1961\nNational Parks Act. However, ongoing legal arbitration in\nThailand has confused the issue of how to regulate use of\nnational park land (ICEM,2003; USAID,2011). As a result,\nuse of protected land by local communities is common\nacross Thailand (FAO,2009). This issue appears to aﬀect\nhow Laem Son National Park is being managed because\nPark o ﬃcials have allowed local authorities to make\ndecisions on Park usage, which has resulted in the present\nconversion of land inside the Park. New management at\nLaem Son National Park attempted to re-establish protec-\ntion in June 2011, by posting eviction notices at all\nplantations on Piak Nam Yai. Shortly thereafter a guard\npost was erected before the bridge to the free-access pier.\nHowever, these e ﬀorts were not successful and the\ndevelopment of the island continues.\nThe macaques of Laem Son National Park are an\nimportant representative population of stone-using long-\ntailed macaques in Thailand. We recommend developing a\nprogramme to monitor and sustain the rare stone-using\ntraditions found in some of Thailand’s long-tailed macaque\npopulations. A nationwide census needs to be conducted to\nexamine the extent and distribution of stone tool-using\nmacaques. Protected habitats in the coastal regions of\nThailand’s marine national park system should be managed\nso that coastal macaques can forage undisturbed. Actions to\nlimit human impacts in protected coastal habitats would\nnot only bene ﬁt stone-using macaques but also other\nspecies that depend on the threatened coastal ecosystems of\nThailand.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Chulalongkorn University Centenary Academic\nDevelopment Project funded this study, with additional\nsupport from the Academic Research Fund of the School of\nHumanities and Social Sciences at Nanyang Technological\nUniversity and the Ministry of Education in Singapore\n(Grant RG 07/95).
