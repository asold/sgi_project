INTRODUCTION \nIn this digital age, data has emerged as the new oil for \nvarious organizations. Share: The Knowledge \nRevolution: How Business  Intelligence Powers \nDecision Making Rapid advancements in Business \nIntelligence (BI) systems, which enable organizations \nto access and process substantial amounts of data for \nanalytical purposes, has resulted in transformative \ninsights powering actionable decision -making. But \nensure the security of sensitive data will become more \nand more challenging as the scale and complexity of \nBI systems continues to evolve. This poses serious \nsecurity issues, especially given the rising  frequency \nand complexity of cyber-attacks and data breaches [1]. \nAs organizations work to gain a competitive  \nadvantage by adopting more sophisticated AI and \nmachine learning tools into their BI ecosystems, the \nthreat to data security can escalate. As a result, data \nsecurity in BI applications has  emerged as one of the \npriorities for organizations. \nBI systems are designed to process large variables of \ndata, and they often  have sensitive data, such as \nfinancial data, customer information, and business \nplans. Classic  security mechanisms (firewalls, \nencryption, and access control systems) have always \nbeen in place to reduce this risk. Though necessary, \nthese tools are not well equipped to address the unique \ndemands of today’s BI environments, especially when \nit comes to  securing data end -to-end. For example, \ndata is ingested, processed, analyzed, and sto red in \ndistributed environments, which allows attacks at \nmany levels [2]. With the increasing adoption of \ncloud-based BI services and third -party vendors for \ndata processing, this is no longer simple, as security \nand compliance risks are multiplied. \nThe enormous volume of data along with its rapid pace \nin BI systems makes traditional security measures \ninadequate. BI applications need continuously \nprocessed data from multiple origins which challenges \nsecurity implementation efforts because they reduce \nsystem speed along with data accessibility. The \n \nEconomic Sciences \nhttps://economic-sciences.com  \nES (2025) 21(1), 914-924| ISSN:1505-4683 \n \n \n \n915 \n \nprocess of protecting three essential components of \ndata remains complex between giving data integrity \nand maintaining confidentiality and data availability. \nThe security needs of BI systems go beyond \nconventional protection methods because \norganizations n eed a solution that detects threats \nindependently and fulfills security benchmarks \nwithout jeopardizing system functionality. \nResearch and practitioner communities now use \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to \nboost security measures for Business Intelligence \nsystem protection. AI demonstrates the potential to \nrectify numerous security limitations of traditional \nprograms because it operates rapidly through data \nanalysis and computes anomalous patterns while using \nprevious behavior patterns for learning [3]. Artificial \nIntelligence agents operate specifically to boost \nsecurity by providing active protection capabilit ies as \nwell as automated decisions and predictive threat \nidentification. The agents perform analyses at extreme \ndata scales to detect security threats with higher \naccuracy rates than human security experts and \nconventional security code. \nOrganizations gain data security at a proactive and \npredictive level by implementing AI -powered models \nwithin their BI applications. Algorithms in machine \nlearning detect strange events through anomaly \ndetection and they flag questionable behavior patterns \nwhile also recognizing new breaches before their \nactual occurrence by using historical data patterns to \nmake predictions. Global enterprises can detect \nunauthorized behaviors through AI anomaly detection \nsystems which spot abnormal data usage patterns [4]. \nThe technology allows developers to build security \npolicies which evolve according to fluctuating \nenvironmental circumstances. BI systems experience \ncontinuous changes in their security environment \nbecause they receive new data sources and handle \nmultiple user access requests while adapting to \nbusiness requirements transformations. AI agents \noperate dynamically to modify security policies \nautonomously which enables organizations to achieve \nbetter data security flexibility and quick response \ncapabilities. Or ganizations need adequate data \nsecurity systems due to the nonstop expansion of data \nvolumes and types in modern environments. \nMultiple research solutions exist in the academic field \nwhich aims to secure business intelligence systems. \nThere exist three fundamental security methods to \nprotect sensitive information: traditional encryption \nmethods together with access control systems and data \nmasking techniques. These secur ity strategies fall \nshort when dealing with the dynamic characteristics \nfound in contemporary BI systems because they \ndemonstrate limited flexibility. Data encryption \nsecures both the movement of data and its storage but \nremains powerless against unauthorized access events \nthat occur in the data processing or analysis phase. The \ncurrent access control methods operate in a fixed \nmanner without considering changes in user actions or \ndata pattern fluctuations. \nTraditional security models exhibit difficulties to \nachieve necessary performance levels when applied to \nBI systems. BI applications require quick and efficient \ndata processing capabilities because of their designed \nworkflow. The insertion of security solu tions that \ndemand high computational resources leads to \ndecreased system functionality which may reduce both \nspeed and accuracy of business information. BI tools \nexperience decreased performance due to encryption \nprocedures which demand high computation po wer \nduring the encryption and decryption of extensive \ndatasets [5]. \n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \nEnterprise organizations that aim to extract valuable \ninsights from their data face data security as an \nessential concern due to the rising complexity and size \nof their Business Intelligence (BI) systems. Protecting \nBI systems requires solving multiple dat a security \nproblems that include securing private data and \nblocking cyber threats and meeting privacy rules. \nSuspension of traditional security tools has become \ninsufficient to manage today's BI systems with their \nchanging nature and increasing size. Scien tific teams \nhave developed multiple frameworks with advanced \nAI and ML technology to address these problems [6]. \n \nEconomic Sciences \nhttps://economic-sciences.com  \nES (2025) 21(1), 914-924| ISSN:1505-4683 \n \n \n \n916 \n \nSecurity Challenges in Business Intelligence \nSystems \nThe main challenge in BI systems revolves around \nprotecting data using measures for confidentiality and \npreserving integrity and data availability. The ability \nof BI applications to extract information from big \ndatasets exposes vital corporate data to poss ible \nsecurity threats. Although firewalls and encryption \nalong with access control form essential components \nof security they cannot adequately protect the complex \nBI system architecture. New BI systems establish \nmore complexity through their distributed f ormat and \ntheir connection with cloud services and multiple \nthird-party data processing vendors. This increase \ncreates distinct challenges regarding compliance and \nrisk management. Businesses face a critical challenge \nwhen they implement more real -time dat a into their \noperational systems because it requires security \nmeasures to perform optimally without restriction. The \nchanging character of BI systems requires \norganizations to transition from fixed security systems \ntoward adaptable intelligent security solutions [7]. \nThe number of cyber -attacks against BI systems has \naccelerated significantly because hackers exploit \nvulnerable data security systems. Research proves that \nestablished security safeguards are unable to handle \nmodern advanced attacks which occur more \nfrequently. Real -time security mechanisms need \nimplementation as a defense against emerging threats \nsince they can identify and react to suspicious \nactivities dynamically. AI together with ML \napproaches are being implemented more frequently to \nprovide such funct ionalities. AI systems through \nautomated threat response successfully identify \nweaknesses that occur outside standard security \nmeasures which have been manually established [8]. \nAI and Machine Learning in Data Security \nThe literature shows substantial interest in the \nimplementation of AI for BI system data security \nenhancement. AI solutions automatically detect \nabnormal data access patterns which helps identify \nactual security threats at present. Machine learning \nmodels installed in BI systems monitor recent data \nentries with user patterns thus automatically adjusting \nsecurity measures through system development. \nAdaptive models provide forward -thinking security \nsolutions for data protection systems that deal with \ncontinuous data intake along with processing and \nanalytical tasks in current BI environments. Through \nanomaly detection algorithms powered by artificial \nintelligence companies can discover deviations from \ntypical user actions that indicate potential security \nbreaches or unauthorized system access within their \nsystems. AI-driven security systems operate at great \nscale to handle extensive datasets as well as \ncomplicated security demands without requiring \nnotable human involvement [9]. \nSecurity systems for BI have been developed using \nmachine learning methods based on clustering \nalgorithms with classification methodology. The \nmodels excel at finding data patterns representing \npossible malicious activities. Real-time anomalies get \ndetected through unsupervised learning algorithms \nwhich compare active activities against known \nbehavioral patterns to eliminate dependence on \npredetermined security rules. AI security systems \novercome heritage rule -based solutions by providing \nbetter security th reat detection with immediate \nresponses [10]. \nAnomaly Detection and Behavioral Analytics \nThe detection of anomalies represents a critical \nfunction when it comes to identifying irregularities in \nBI systems through their operational patterns. The \ndefensive mechanisms traditionally used by IT \nsecurity reactively identify security breaches once \nattacks and breaches unfold. The predictive and \npreventative aspects of anomaly detection through AI \nallows systems to detect unauthorized behavior \npatterns which signal potential security threats. BI \nenvironments benefit from AI models that monitor \nhuman be havior patterns to detect unusual activities \nsuch as accessing sensitive information beyond the \noperation period and different geographical zones. The \nsystems trigger automated responses through their \ncapabilities to deal with potential security threats. The \nAI sensor known as behavioral analytics functions as \n \nEconomic Sciences \nhttps://economic-sciences.com  \nES (2025) 21(1), 914-924| ISSN:1505-4683 \n \n \n \n917 \n \na behavioral analytics system which learns from user \nactivities throughout time to spot irregularities. The \nsystem provides detailed analytical capabilities that \nsurpass basic access restrictions so organizations can \nobserve their data utilization at a finer level. The rising \ndependence on cloud -based services and external \nvendors for data processing requires strongly \nadvanced monitoring systems because the need has \nbecome more evident [11]. \nMultiple research works demonstrate how AI agents \ndeploy their capabilities to track users' actions deeply \nwhich enables identification of internal security \nbreaches together with unauthorized system entry \npatterns. AI behavioral analytics develops complet e \nuser profiles by keeping track of system interactions to \ndetect suspicious activity based on deviations from \nstandard user behavior. Behavioral analytics provides \nprotection to BI systems through its ability to reveal \nimportant details about how users access sensitive data \nincluding exact times and places and data access \nmethods [12]. \nFrameworks for Secure Data Processing in BI \nThe implementation of AI and machine learning \nmodels within BI systems through new research-based \nframeworks provides an effective solution for security \nproblems. The field has implemented secure BI \nframeworks which utilize AI technology for privacy \nprotection while conducting anomaly detection tasks. \nThe AI -powered models operate through real -time \nsecurity tracking to secure data at every phase of \nprocessing. Data security remains uninterrupted \nthrough these integrated frameworks which protect \nsystem perfo rmance and data accessibility in BI \nsystems. AI frameworks enable security programs to \ngenerate dynamic protective measures through real -\ntime threat analysis and contextual information \ntracking. AI agents in cloud -based BI applications \nmodify security stan dards based on the information \nsensitivity of processed data along with user risk \nactions [13]. \nThe security framework developed by researchers \nimplements dual security mechanisms which bring \ntogether both encryption methods of data protection \nwith artificial intelligence systems for continuous \nmonitoring. Such security frameworks protect data \nthrough different security phases which extend from \ndata processing entry points to analytical stages. Such \nsecurity methods enable complete protection of  \nsensitive data during transit as well as processing \noperations which traditional security models often fail \nto address. Programs integrated with AI models within \nthese systems continuously assess operation risks so \nthey can adjust security protocol levels to prevent \nunauthorized entry [14]. \nLimitations of Traditional Security Measures \nThe core data protection tools such as encryption and \naccess controls and data masking methods do not \nprovide sufficient security for modern BI systems \nagainst growing threats. Encryption protects data \nduring transmission and storage successfully but it \nprovides no protection during the processing and \nanalysis phase. A security breach can happen during \ndata manipulation or computation stages because \nencryption does not provide complete security for BI \nsystems. The rigid nature of static access control \nsystems makes them incapable of adapting to changes \nin BI system user behaviors along with changing \naccess requirements. The flexible approach to BI \nsecurity stands vital for delivering full protection to \nbusiness information systems. Traditional security \nprotection methods cause substantial computational \noverhead that damages BI system execution \nperformance. The decryption procedures of extensive \ndatasets tend to slow down the system which results in \ndelayed business insights delivery. AI-driven security \nframeworks ensure real -time monitoring alongside \nimmediate responses while maintaining system \nperformance undisturbed thus creating an efficient and \nexpandable method to protect data [15]. \nPerformance Considerations in Secure BI Systems \nLiterature studies address deeply the relationship \nopposing security requirements and performance \noutcomes. Security mechanisms implemented by \norganizations must undergo performance \nconsideration before deployment to their BI systems. \nThe strong security c apabilities of encryption and \n \nEconomic Sciences \nhttps://economic-sciences.com  \nES (2025) 21(1), 914-924| ISSN:1505-4683 \n \n \n \n918 \n \naccess control systems lead to latency -based \nperformance degradation of BI applications mainly \nduring large dataset operations. Scientists suggest \nhybrid security methods which integrate standard data \nprotection protocols with artificial intelligence -based \nsolutions to keep operational speed and provide \nstrengthened system protection [16]. \nThe security capabilities based on AI allow \nadministrators to optimize their models for reducing \nexecution slowdowns that conventional security \nsolutions often create. Machine learning tools enable \nsecurity monitoring at low operational speed while \nmaintaining near real-time security operations without \ninterrupting BI performance speed. The combination \nof performance enhancements has made AI -based \nsecurity systems highly appealing for managing large-\nscale BI systems that demand high speeds and \npowerful security measures [17]. \nFuture Directions and Research Gaps \nBI system security presents future research \nopportunities that will oversee its ongoing \ndevelopment. AI models linked with blockchain \ntechnology have emerged as security platforms that \nincrease the traceability while securing BI data. The \ndecentralized approach of Blockchain would enhance \nAI security systems by creating an unalterable \ndatabase that records all data access operations. \nFederated learning has gained attention because its \nability to train machine learning models throughout \ndecentralized data sources without requiring sensitive \ninformation sharing to happen. A secure privacy -\nprotecting data enhancement solution exists through \nblockchain technology for applications requiring \nmulti-party privacy such as BI security [18]. \n3. METHODOLOGY \nFramework Design \nThe proposed system includes three primary sections \nto perform data ingestion followed by processing and \nreal-time threat detection processes. The framework \noperates through three interactive elements that let \nartificial intelligence agents track security policy \nchanges through real -time data evaluation. The \nframework depends on artificial intelligence learning \ntechnologies for anomaly detection and behavioral \nanalytics to identify security threats while adjusting \nsecurity measures according to BI platform changes. \n• Data Ingestion : At the data ingestion stage, the \nAI agents perform an initial analysis of incoming \ndata to assess potential risks or vulnerabilities. \nThis includes identifying any anomalous or \nsuspicious behavior in the raw data that may \nindicate malicious intent or unauthorized access. \nLet the data input be represented as: \n(1) \nwhere X is the set of incoming data points and xi is an \nindividual data point. The AI agent processes this data \nto identify suspicious patterns based on historical \nbehavior. \nData Processing and Analysis : During the data \nprocessing phase, machine learning models are \napplied to continuously monitor user behaviors, data \naccess patterns, and system activities. These models \nflag any deviations from normal operations, which \ncould point to potential security th reats. This \ncomponent ensures that the system remains agile, \nadjusting security measures dynamically in response \nto real-time data and risk analysis. \nThe anomaly detection is formulated as: \n(2) \nwhere A is the set of anomaly scores, and ai represents \nthe score for a particular data point xi. The anomaly \nscore ai is calculated using a machine learning model \nf based on past behavior: \n(3) \nA high score ai  indicates anomalous behavior that \nrequires attention. \n\n \nEconomic Sciences \nhttps://economic-sciences.com  \nES (2025) 21(1), 914-924| ISSN:1505-4683 \n \n \n \n919 \n \nReal-time Threat Detection and Response : The \nframework incorporates AI -driven real -time threat \ndetection capabilities that allow the system to \nautomatically respond to security breaches before they \nescalate. By analyzing patterns of user behavior and \naccess to sensitive data, the framework can identify \nunauthorized activities such as data exfiltration or \ninsider threats, and take appropriate action to mitigate \nthese risks. \nReal-time detection is achieved by analyzing the \nbehavior of users over time, modeled by the following \nequation: \n(4) \n• where P is the prediction of a potential threat, ut  \nis the current user behavior at time t, and 𝑢𝑡−𝑖 are \npast behavior states. The function g is a machine \nlearning model that predicts whether the current \nbehavior is a deviation from the norm. \nMachine Learning Integration \nMachine learning techniques are central to the \nframework's ability to adapt to emerging security \nthreats. The system continuously learns from historical \ndata and evolving patterns of user behavior, which \nallows it to detect anomalies and predict potential \nbreaches in real-time. \n• Anomaly Detection : The framework uses \nanomaly detection models that are trained on \nhistorical data to identify unusual patterns in user \nbehavior, such as accessing sensitive data at odd \nhours or from unfamiliar locations. These models \nhelp to flag suspicious activities early, preventing \npotential security breaches. \nAnomalies are detected based on statistical analysis of \nuser behavior. For instance, a typical anomaly \ndetection formula might be: \n(5) \nwhere xi  is the observed data, μ is the mean of \nhistorical behavior, and σ is the standard deviation. \nAnomaly scores greater than a set threshold indicate a \npotential security risk. \nBehavioral Analytics : In addition to anomaly \ndetection, the framework incorporates behavioral \nanalytics to monitor and understand how users interact \nwith the BI system. By building profiles of legitimate \nuser actions, the system can identify deviations from \nnormal behavior and take corrective measures. This is \nparticularly useful for detecting insider threats, where \na user might be exploiting their access privileges for \nmalicious purposes. \nBehavioral profiles can be generated using clustering \nalgorithms, where users are grouped based on their \nbehavior: \n(6) \nwhere B is the set of behavioral profiles, and bk  \nrepresents a specific user profile. The system detects \nany significant deviations from these profiles to flag \npotential risks. \nSecurity Protocol Adjustment \nA key feature of the proposed framework is its ability \nto adjust security measures dynamically based on \ncontextual information. For instance, when processing \nparticularly sensitive data, the AI agents may apply \nstronger encryption protocols or restrict acc ess to \nspecific users. This approach ensures that security is \nadaptive and responsive to the data's sensitivity and \nthe risk level associated with the user's actions. \n• Dynamic Policy Adjustment : The AI agents \nmonitor user actions and system events, adjusting \nsecurity policies based on the context. For \nexample, if a user tries to access a large amount of \nsensitive data from an unfamiliar device, the \nsystem may automatically enforce additional \nverification steps to confirm the user's identity or \nrestrict access until further investigation is \nconducted. \nThe dynamic adjustment can be represented as: \n\n \nEconomic Sciences \nhttps://economic-sciences.com  \nES (2025) 21(1), 914-924| ISSN:1505-4683 \n \n \n \n920 \n \n(7) \n• where St  is the security state at time t, α is the \nweight assigned to the previous security state, and \nβ represents the adjustment based on risk level. \nThe risk level is determined based on contextual \ndata (e.g., user behavior, data sensitivity, etc.). \nReal-time Monitoring and Continuous Learning \nThe framework is designed to operate continuously, \nproviding ongoing monitoring and real -time \nadaptation to emerging security threats. AI agents are \nbuilt to learn from new data and evolving user \nbehaviors, improving their threat detection capabilities \nover time. This continuous learning process ensures \nthat the framework remains effective as BI systems \ngrow and evolve. \n• Continuous Data Monitoring: The AI agents are \nresponsible for maintaining an ongoing watch \nover data as it is ingested, processed, and \nanalyzed. By continuously analyzing data access \npatterns and user behaviors, the system is always \nin a state of readiness to detect and respond to \npotential security incidents. \nContinuous learning can be formalized by: \n(8) \n• where θt is the set of model parameters at time t, \nη is the learning rate, and ∇L(θ) is the gradient of \nthe loss function. This formula represents the \nincremental learning process where the model \ncontinuously improves as new data arrives. \nFramework Evaluation and Validation \nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed \nframework, a series of experiments were conducted \nusing a sample BI system. The system was subjected \nto various simulated security threats, such as \nunauthorized data access and potential data breaches, \nto test the framework’s ability to detect and respond in \nreal-time. The results demonstrated that the \nframework could successfully identify security risks \nand prevent potential breaches while maintaining \nsystem performance. \n• Performance Metrics : The framework’s \nefficiency was measured by its ability to detect \nthreats without introducing significant latency or \naffecting the performance of the BI system. \nAdditionally, the accuracy of the anomaly \ndetection models and the effectiveness of the \ndynamic security adjustments were evaluated to \nensure that security protocols did not hinder data \navailability or accessibility. \n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nThis section describes the results of implementing the \nAI-driven secure data processing framework in BI \napplications. \nAnomaly Detection Accuracy \nThe anomaly detection algorithm successfully \nidentified potential security threats, including \nunauthorized access attempts, abnormal data usage \npatterns, and unusual data transfers. The model \nachieved the following performance metrics: \n• Accuracy: 92% \n• Precision: 90% \n• Recall: 94% \n\n \nEconomic Sciences \nhttps://economic-sciences.com  \nES (2025) 21(1), 914-924| ISSN:1505-4683 \n \n \n \n921 \n \n \nFig 1: Anomaly Detection Accuracy \nThe bar chart above  figure 1  demonstrates the high \naccuracy, precision, and recall of the anomaly \ndetection system, indicating its effectiveness in \ndetecting threats without significant misclassification. \nTime-to-Response for Real-Time Threat Detection \n \nFig 2: Time-to-Response for Real-Time Threat Detection. \nThe bar chart above of figure 2 represents the time-to-\nresponse for real-time threat detection during different \nsimulated incidents. The framework was able to detect \nand mitigate threats within an average of 2.5 seconds, \nwith most responses occurring in under 5 seconds, \nindicating the system's swift ability to react to security \nthreats. \n\n \nEconomic Sciences \nhttps://economic-sciences.com  \nES (2025) 21(1), 914-924| ISSN:1505-4683 \n \n \n \n922 \n \n \nFig 3: Performance Degradation vs. Security Measures. \nThe line graph above  figure 3 shows the performance \ndegradation when security measures are applied.

As the system \nprocessed new data and adapted to evolving user \nbehaviors, its accuracy in detecting anomalies \nimproved by 5%, reaching 95% by week five. \nCONCLUSION \nThis paper proposed a novel AI-driven framework for \nsecure data processing in Business Intelligence (BI) \napplications, addressing the increasing security \nconcerns that arise from handling large, dynamic \ndatasets. The framework incorporates machine \nlearning models for anomaly detection, real -time \nthreat detection, and dynamic security policy \nadjustment, offering a proactive, scalable, and \nefficient solution to BI system security. \nThe results from the experimental evaluation show \nthat the proposed framework is highly effective in \nenhancing data security while maintaining the \nperformance of the BI system. With high accuracy in \nanomaly detection, fast response times, minimal \nperformance degradation, and effective dynamic \nsecurity policy adjustments, the framework proves to \nbe a robust solution for securing modern BI \nenvironments. The continuous learning mechanism \nensures that the system adapts to new and evolving \nsecurity threats, furt her strengthening its capabilities \nover time. \nIn summary, the AI -driven secure data processing \nframework is a promising approach for safeguarding \nsensitive business data in BI systems, offering both \nsecurity and operational efficiency. \nFuture Recommendations \nFurther improvements to the suggested framework \nshould consist of implementing blockchain \ntechnology for tracking purposes alongside using \nfederated learning to protect privacy in multiple -party \nsystems and including deep learning with \nreinforcement learni ng to identify sophisticated \nthreats. The framework requires integration with cloud \nsecurity solutions and testing across multiple \nindustries to enhance effectiveness as well as practical \ndeployment of blockchain technology for traceability \nreporting. User  behavior analytics systems will \nachieve better anomaly detection outcomes for insider \nthreats through additional analytical development. \nEnduring adaptations in security systems need to be \nmade for organizations to address upcoming data \nsecurity obstacles. \nREFERENCES \n1.
