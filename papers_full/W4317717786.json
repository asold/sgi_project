  "abstract": "There are no clear guidelines or validated models for artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches in the monitoring of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who were isolated in the community, in order to identify early deterioration of their health symptoms. Developed in partnership with Curious Thing (CT), a Sydney-based AI conversational technology, a new care robot technology was introduced in South Western Sydney (SWS) in September 2021 to manage the large numbers of low-to-medium risk patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis and who were isolating at home. The CT interface made contact with patients via their mobile phone, following a locally produced script to obtain information recording physical condition, wellness and support. The care robot has engaged over 6323 patients between 2 September to 14 December 2021. The AI-assisted phone calls effectively identified the patients requiring further support, saved clinician time by monitoring less ailing patients remotely, and enabled them to spend more time on critically ill patients, thus ensuring that service and supply resources could be directed to those at greatest need. Engagement strategies had ensured stakeholders support of this technology to meet clinical and welfare needs of the identified patient group. Feedback from both the patients and healthcare staff was positive and had informed the ongoing formulation of a more patient-centred model of virtual care.",
