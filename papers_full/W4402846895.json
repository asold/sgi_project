  "abstract": "Background Social determinants of health (SDoH) such as housing insecurity are known to be intricately linked to patients’ health status. More efficient methods for abstracting structured data on SDoH can help accelerate the inclusion of exposome variables in biomedical research and support health care systems in identifying patients who could benefit from proactive outreach. Large language models (LLMs) developed from Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) have shown potential for performing complex abstraction tasks on unstructured clinical notes. Objective Here, we assess the performance of GPTs on identifying temporal aspects of housing insecurity and compare results between both original and deidentified notes. Methods We compared the ability of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to identify instances of both current and past housing instability, as well as general housing status, from 25,217 notes from 795 pregnant women. Results were compared with manual abstraction, a named entity recognition model, and regular expressions. Results Compared with GPT-3.5 and the named entity recognition model, GPT-4 had the highest performance and had a much higher recall (0.924) than human abstractors (0.702) in identifying patients experiencing current or past housing instability, although precision was lower (0.850) compared with human abstractors (0.971). GPT-4’s precision improved slightly (0.936 original, 0.939 deidentified) on deidentified versions of the same notes, while recall dropped (0.781 original, 0.704 deidentified). Conclusions This work demonstrates that while manual abstraction is likely to yield slightly more accurate results overall, LLMs can provide a scalable, cost-effective solution with the advantage of greater recall. This could support semiautomated abstraction, but given the potential risk for harm, human review would be essential before using results for any patient engagement or care decisions. Furthermore, recall was lower when notes were deidentified prior to LLM abstraction.",
