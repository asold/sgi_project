    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel approach to personalized information retrieval by integrating retrieval augmentation generation (RAG) with a personalized database system. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive text generation capabilities but face limitations in knowledge accuracy and hallucinations. Our research addresses these challenges by combining LLMs with structured, personalized data to enhance search precision and relevance. By tagging keywords within personal documents and organizing information into context-based categories, users can conduct efficient searches within their data repositories. We conducted experiments using the GPT-3.5 and text-embedding-ada-002 models and evaluated the RAG assessment framework with five different language models and two embedding models. Our results indicate that the combination of GPT-3.5 and text-embedding-ada-002 is effective for a personalized database question-answering system, with potential for various language models depending on the application. Our approach offers improved accuracy, real-time data updates, and enhanced user experience, making a significant contribution to information retrieval by LLMs and impacting various artificial intelligence applications.",
