  "abstract": "In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into education, particularly for Personalized Language Learning (PLL), has garnered significant attention. This approach tailors interventions to address the unique challenges faced by individual learners. Large Language Models (LLMs), including Chatbots, have demonstrated a substantial potential in automating and enhancing educational tasks, effectively capturing the complexity and diversity of human language. In this study, 52 foreign language students were randomly divided into two groups: one with the assistance of a Chatbot based on LLMs and one without. Both groups learned the same series of target words over eight weeks. Post-treatment assessments, including systematic observation and quantitative tests assessing both receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge, were conducted immediately after the study and again two weeks later. The findings demonstrate that employing an AI Chatbot based on LLMs significantly aids students in acquiring both receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge during their second language learning journey. Notably, Chatbots contribute to the long-term retention of productive vocabulary and facilitate incidental vocabulary learning. This study offers valuable insights into the practical benefits of LLM-based tools in language learning, with a specific emphasis on vocabulary development. Chatbots utilizing LLMs emerge as effective language learning aids. It emphasizes the importance of educators understanding the potential of these technologies in L2 vocabulary instruction and encourages the adoption of strategic teaching methods incorporating such tools.",
