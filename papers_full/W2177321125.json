Studies also reveal that the lncRNAs are extensively\ninvolved numerous cellular processes, such as embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency, eryth-\nropoiesis, cell-cycle regulation and diseases [8– 11]. However, current lncRNA function studies\ncan be hampered by lack of complete and high-quality lncRNA gene annotations, especially\nwhen conducting analysis on the genome scale. Although there appear several lncRNA data\nsources, such as lncRNAdb [12], NONCODE [13] and GENCODE [14], they seldom perform\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654 October 5, 2015 1/1 6\na11111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Sun L, Liu H, Zhang L, Meng J (2015)\nlncRScan-SVM: A Tool for Predicting Long Non-\nCoding RNAs Using Support Vector Machine.

Meanwhile, with the widespread usage of deep sequencing in life sci-\nence, more and more novel lncRNAs can be found due to their tissue-specific expression char-\nacteristic. The newly-discovered lncRNAs are always compared with previous annotations for\nguaranteeing the quality of further analysis [\n8, 9].\nEither for lncRNA gene annotation or novel lncRNA discovery, it is crucial to evaluate the\nprotein coding potential of a transcript. As similar as protein-coding genes, lncRNAs are RNA\npolymerase II products, and can be capped and polyadenylated [\n16], and also present similar\nhistone-modification profiles, splicing signals and exon/intron lengths [15]. Due to the similar-\nities between mRNAs and lncRNAs, it is challenging to separate the lncRNA transcripts\n(LNCTs) from the protein coding ones (PCTs) [\n17].\nThanks to the advance of bioinformatics, discriminating LNCTs from PCTs can be mod-\nelled as a binary classification problem, which has been solved by several computational meth-\nods, such as CONC [\n18], CPC [19], CNCI [20], iSeeRNA [21] and RNAcon [22]. CONC\nintegrates various features in its classification model, but it is slow for large datasets and also\nperforms less accurate than other newer methods such as CPC [19]. CPC uses features derived\nfrom open reading frame (ORF) and sequence alignment, and the developers also provide\nusers with a web interface. CNCI distinguishes protein-coding and non-coding sequences by\nprofiling adjoining nucleotide triplets, however it cannot work on large datasets. iSeeRNA out-\nperforms previous methods and it also provides users with a program for training a new classi-\nfication model based on custom dataset. RNAcon applies features of tri-nucleotide\ncomposition to the classification, but it does not show better performance than other methods\nin our experiment. Compared to these support vector machine (SVM) based methods inspect-\ning the entire transcript, a comparative genomics method named PhyloCSF [\n23] focuses on\nclassifying protein-coding and non-coding regions, and it has been frequently used for lncRNA\nidentification [7, 24]. In addition, CPAT [25] is another tool for assessing coding potential of a\ntranscript using an alignment-free logistic regression model. Based on these computational\nmethods, lncRNA function studies usually build a pipeline to obtain a set of confident lncRNAs\n[\n16, 24, 26]. For example, a simple pipeline consisting of length filtering (> 200nt), CPC and\nBLAST [27] can make a stringent lncRNA dataset. However, it is still not convenient to master\nsuch non-standard filtering workflow.\nAs various information and data about lncRNAs are preserved by previous studies, it is\nappealing to develop new methods to identify the lncRNAs more accurately. By integrating fea-\ntures derived from gene structure, transcript sequence, potential codon sequence and conserva-\ntion, a novel computational method is proposed here for solving the problem.\nMethods\nGold-standard datasets\nSince a reliable dataset is of importance to model training and testing, we adopted the high-\nquality manually-curated GENCODE gene annotations (version 19/v19 of human and version\nM2/vM2 of mouse) [14, 15] for constructing the gold-standard datasets, which are composed\nof gene annotations inGene Transfer Format (GTF) and corresponding genome sequences in\nFASTA format for human and mouse respectively. Specifically, the human gene annotation\n(GENCODEv19) includes 81814 PCTs and 23898 LNCTs, while the counts are 47394 and\n6053 respectively for mouse (GENCODEvM2). In addition, the genome sequences of human\n(GRCh37/hg19) and mouse (GRCm38/mm10) were downloaded from University of California\nSanta Cruz (UCSC) genome browser respectively [\n28]. For model training and testing, we cre-\nated Training-A, Testing-A and Testing-B (S1 Dataset) by splitting the gold-standard datasets\nA Tool for Predicting lncRNAs Using SVM\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654 October 5, 2015 2/1 6\nrepository(http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/\ngoldenPath/hg19/chromosomes/, http://hgdownload.\ncse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/chromosomes/).\nFunding: This work was supported by National\nNatural Science Foundation of China (61301220 to\nLS, 61201408 to HL, 61401370 to JM),\nhttp://www.\nnsfc.gov.cn/; China Fundamental Research Funds for\nthe Central Universities (2014QNA84 to HL,\n2014QNB47 to LZ),\nhttp://www.moe.edu.cn/; and\nJiangsu Natural Science Foundation (BK20140403 to\nJM),\nhttp://www.jstd.gov.cn/. The funders had no role\nin study design, data collection and analysis, decision\nto publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\n(See Table 1). All transcripts in training and testing sets were randomly sampled from the com-\nplete dataset, and there are no overlapping areas between the training and testing sets. Since\nour prediction model was trained on Training-A, in which a proportion of transcripts may\nhave similar sequences to that in Testing-A, which could lead to an unfair comparison between\nour method and the others though our method does not only use sequence features. To make a\nfairer comparison, Testing-B datasets were created by removing similar transcripts from Test-\ning-A using CD-HIT (v4.6.1, cut-off 0.8) [\n29], compared to Training-A sequences. To alleviate\nthe effect of imbalanced-classes, we constructed the training and testing sets with equal or simi-\nlar sizes.\nFeature selection\nSince each feature selected can affect the overall classification performance, we conducted fea-\nture selection (FS) (See\nS1 File) based on a set of candidate features, which were derived from\nour current knowledge about lncRNAs. The candidate features can be classified into three cate-\ngories. The first category includes features extracted from nucleotide sequences, and they are\n14 tri-nucleotides attributes, namely ACG, CCG, CGA, CGC, CGG, CGT, CTA, GCG, GGG,\nGTA, TAA, TAC, TAG and TCG [\n22], and standard deviation of stop codons (TAG, TAA and\nTGA) between three frames, and GC content. The second category was extracted from the out-\nput of a program calledtxCdsPredict from UCSC, which is used to predict a codon sequence\nwith the most likelihood from an input nucleotide sequence, and it includes features like\ntxCdsPredict score, CDS length and CDS percentage (CDS_length divided by transcrip-\nt_length) [\n21]. The third category of features was extracted from gene structure of the tran-\nscript, and they are transcript length, exon count and average exon length.\nThen six features (SeeTable 2) were selected from the total candidates by FS. First, tran-\nscript length was selected since the length of PCTs and LNCTs can be differentially distributed\n[7, 15, 24]. Second, with an assumption that a true PCT may have a long ORF in one of the\nTable 1.

Theﬁrst two rows show counts of\ndivided human dataset while the other two ones show that of mouse. For human, Training-A includes 5000\nPCTs randomly sampled from the totalling 81814 ones, and 5000 LNCTs sampled from the totalling 23898\nones. Human Testing-A was created by sampling another 10000 PCTs and LNCTs respectively, and\nhuman Testing-B containing 8307 PCTs and 8875 LNCTs was created by removing transcripts that show\nsimilar sequences (cutoff 0.8 of CD-HIT) to that in Training-A from Testing-A. Similarly for mouse, the\ncounts of PCTs and LNCTs in Training-A are both 2500, and the count is 3500 in Testing-A. And counts of\nTesting-B for mouse PCTs and LNCTs are 3130 and 2975 respectively. Besides, the remaining transcripts\n(Remaining) were not taken into account in the analysis.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654.t001\nA Tool for Predicting lncRNAs Using SVM\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654 October 5, 2015 3/1 6\nthree frames translated, we presume that the stop codons in the frame where the ORF emerges\nare fewer than that randomly appear in the other two frames. Therefore, we selected the stan-\ndard deviation (SCS) of stop codon counts (SCC) between three frames translated as the second\nfeature since the standard deviation of PCT should be smaller than that of LNCT (See Eqs (1)\nand (2)).\n/C22x ¼ 1\n3\nX2\ni¼0\nSCCi ð1Þ\nSCS ¼\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\n1\n3\nX2\ni¼0\nðSCCi /C0 /C22xÞ\n2\ns\nð2Þ\nwhere /C22x denotes the mean of stop codon counts of three frames (SCC0, SCC1 and SCC2).\nThen SCS can be calculated usingEq (2). Similarly, since the PCT may have ORF potentially,\nwe usedtxCdsPredict to predict the codon sequence (CDS) of the candidate transcript, and the\nscore output bytxCdsPredict was selected as the third feature. By analysing the gene structures\nof transcripts, the exon count and average exon length were selected as features because the\nlncRNA genes may have fewer exons and be shorter than the protein-coding ones. The last fea-\nture we selected is the conservation score calculated by averaging PhastCons scores of the\ntranscript.\nlncRScan-SVM\nThe six features selected above were fed into the SVM framework to build a tool named\nlncRScan-SVM (v1.0.0), which also depends on several third-part packages/programs such as\nBioPython [\n30], LIBSVM [31] andtxCdsPredict. Of the programs packaged by lncRScan-SVM,\ntwo scripts can commonly be used. One islncRScan-SVM-train.py for training a SVM model\nand the other one islncRScan-SVM-predict.py for predicting PCTs/LNCTs (SeeFig 1).

A SVM model for prediction can be generated usinglncRScan-SVM-\ntrain.py (See Fig 1a). Specifically, thelncRScan-SVM-train.py program first extracts nucleotide\nsequences according to the gene models of training samples. Then a scriptextract_features.py\nis used to extract transcript features. After transferring features to a standard format of\nTable 2.

In this paper,‘positive’ and ‘negative’ correspond to PCT\nand LNCT respectively. And area under curve (AUC) of receiver operation characteristic\n(ROC) are also used as another indicator [32]. In addition, PhyloCSF is not took into account\nas it focuses on distinguishing protein-coding regions from non-coding ones, which is slightly\ndifferent from the objective of the methods for classifying PCTs and LNCTs.\nEthics Statement\nN/A\nResults and Discussion\nPerformance of single feature\nSince every candidate feature can contribute to the overall classification performance of a pre-\ndictor, the performance of each feature was evaluated by AUC scores on the hg19 and mm10\nTraining-A datasets respectively (See\nFig 2). As seen from the ranking result, the top eight fea-\ntures are CDS length, consv, CDS score, CDS percentage, exon count, stop codon std, tran-\nscript length and CGA, which show slightly different orders between hg19 and mm10.\nParticularly, five of the six lncRScan-SVM features, namely transcript length, stop codon std,\nCDS score, exon count and consv, are included in the top eight ranked features, which indicates\nthat most of the lncRScan-SVM features can contribute positively to the predictor. In addition,\nthe features of hg19 and mm10 represent similar performance as seen from the the Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient (0.9484604) of the AUC scores, which shows the robustness of classifica-\ntion performance of the candidate features between the species.\nComparison of prediction methods\nThe prediction performance of lncRScan-SVM was evaluated by comparing to several other\nmethods, such as CPC, CPAT, iSeeRNA and RNAcon, on Testing-A and Testing-B. When test-\ning iSeeRNA, we used two kinds of models. One is the default iSeeRNA prediction model and\nthe other one (iSeeRNA2) is generated by re-training iSeeRNA on Training-A. As a result,\nlncRScan-SVM outperforms other methods in most aspects, such as SPC, ACC, MCC and\nAUC (See Tables\n3 and 4).\nAs seen from the testing result on Testing-A for either hg19 or mm10, lncRScan-SVM\nshows slightly smaller SPC, but higher SES and overall ACC, MCC and AUC scores than\nCPAT. In contrast, RNAcon presents the worst performance as it obtains the lowest score in\nA Tool for Predicting lncRNAs Using SVM\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654 October 5, 2015 6/1 6\nFig 2.

The biggest value in each column is in bold font while the smallest one is underlined.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654.t003\nA Tool for Predicting lncRNAs Using SVM\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654 October 5, 2015 7/1 6\nmost aspects. CPC obtains the highest SES (97.62% for hg19 and 98.371% for mm10), but it\nshows poor performance in other aspects, e.g. the lowest SPC score (67.23% for hg19 and\n75.457% for mm10), which means CPC may ignore a considerable proportion of true lncRNAs.\nBy training on Training-A, iSeeRNA2 shows better performance than the default one, but it is\nstill less accurate than lncRScan-SVM.\nMeanwhile, similar performance of these methods can be observed from the testing result\non Testing-B of hg19 and mm10, where our lncRScan-SVM predictor consistently shows better\nperformance than other methods. As seen from the result on mm10 Testing-B (\nTable 4),\nlncRScan-SVM is ranked the highest in almost all aspects, including SPC, ACC, MCC and\nAUC. As indicated by SES, CPC still has a bias towards predicting PCTs, but has poor overall\nperformance. Although the re-trained iSeeRNA2 shows similar overall performance to\nlncRScan-SVM, its SPC scores are much lower than the latter one, which means iSeeRNA2\nwould perform less accurate for identifying lncRNAs than lncRScan-SVM. In addition, the\nAUC scores of these methods are visualized by ROC curves (Figs\n3, 4, 5 and 6).\nIn addition to the accuracy evaluation, the computation time of these methods was also\ncompared on the same platform (Linux, Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS 64bit, 800 MHz × 4 processors\nand 4GB RAM). As seen fromTable 5, lncRScan-SVM shows the longest computation time\n(Nearly twice slower than iSeeRNA, four times slower than RNAcon and ten times slower than\nCPAT) when conducting lncRNA prediction on Testing-A of hg19 and mm10 respectively.\nThe computation time difference can be caused by several reasons, such as different algorithms\nand programming languages. As seen from the table, either of the methods with query file in\nFASTA, namely CPAT and RNAcon, represents shorter running time than the other ones with\nGTF is mainly because the latter one needs longer time to extract sequence information accord-\ning to the gene annotation in GTF. CPAT is faster than RNAcon because the logistic regression\nmodel used by the former one could be faster than SVM used by RNAcon. And our lncRScan-\nSVM is slower than iSeeRNA is mainly because we used Python scripts to implement our\nmethod, which can be optimized and accelerated using C programming in the future. Despite\nof that, the computation time of current lncRScan-SVM could be acceptable since its running\ntime for precessing thousands of transcripts is still limited in several minutes or seconds. It is\nworth noting that CPC was not taken into account in the comparison because it is quite slow\nwhen running on the same platform. For example, it takes about 3 minutes to process only one\nsequence, which is much slower than the other methods.\nTable 4.

Before conducting lncRNA predic-\ntion, we checked the overlap between these datasets. As seen fromFig 7plotted by eulerAPE v3\n[33], the human lncRNA annotated by NONCODEv4 contains most of the lncRNAs annotated\nby Cabili et al. (21106,*88.32%) and GENCODEv19 (13546,*94.38%) due to the fact that\nNONCODEv4 published on 2014 collects a large number of ncRNAs from various literatures\nand databases [\n13]. On the other hand, the overlapping area between Cabili et al. and GENCO-\nDEv19 lncRNAs is small (3874,*16.36% of GENCODEv19 or*27.24% of Cabili et al.).\nFig 3.

As a result, lncRScan-SVM successfully identified\n14069 (98.52%) of 14281 lincRNAs annotated by Cabili et al., which were generated by a com-\nplex filtering pipeline mentioned in their paper [7]. On the NONCODEv4 lncRNA dataset,\nlncRScan-SVM successfully predicted 77435 (85.63%) of the totalling 90429 lncRNAs, which is\nmuch lower than that on the Cabili et al. dataset due to the fact that the lncRScan-SVM predic-\ntion model trained on GENCODEv19 that contains 12152 (50.85%) lincRNAs might have a\nbias towards predicting lincRNAs rather than non-intergenic lncRNAs. To test this hypothesis,\nwe conducted lncRScan-SVM on the 43730 lincRNAs (the lncRNAs located in the intergenic\nregions of GENCODEv19 protein coding transcripts) extracted from the NONCODEv4 data-\nset. As a result, 41984 (96.01%) lincRNA were predicted successfully. Similarly, the prediction\nratios of the other methods all decline as test sets change from lncRNA to lincRNA, which\nmeans they all have a bias towards predicting lincRNAs. In contrast, most of the other tools\nFig 4. ROC curves of lncRNA prediction on mm10 Testing-A.The description of ROC curves for tests on mm10 Testing-A is the same asFig 3.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654.g004\nA Tool for Predicting lncRNAs Using SVM\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654 October 5, 2015 10 / 16\nrepresent lower prediction ratios than lncRScan-SVM on the three datasets except CPAT,\nwhich has the highest prediction ratio (90.29%) on NONCODEv4 lncRNA dataset since CPAT\nhas a bias towards predicting the lncRNAs (See previous section). However, CPAT still repre-\nsents poorer performance on either Cabili et al. or NONCODEv4 lincRNAs. Overall, the pre-\ndiction of these methods on the general lncRNA datasets is consistent with that on our gold-\nstandard sets.\nIn addition, the remaining 72 lincRNAs of Cabili et al. dataset and 1964 lncRNAs or 1914\nlincRNAs of NONCODEv4 were not took into account analysis because they are not annotated\non the main reference chromosomes, such as chr1, chr2 and so on, but are annotated on on the\nother regions such as patches, scaffolds and haplotypes, and they can not be processed by sev-\neral methods.\nFig 5. ROC curves of lncRNA prediction on hg19 Testing-B.The description of ROC curves for tests on hg19 Testing-B is the same asFig 3.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654.g005\nA Tool for Predicting lncRNAs Using SVM\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654 October 5, 2015 11 / 16\nDiscussion\nThe lncRNA prediction problem can be solved by several computational methods mentioned\nabove, especially our lncRScan-SVM performs better than the others in several aspects by inte-\ngrating information extracted from gene structure, sequence composition and conservation in\nthe SVM framework. However several problems remain to be specified. First, novel features\nand models can be developed to improve the prediction performance. For example, features\ncan be extracted from secondary structure of RNA since functional lncRNAs may have special\npatterns in the secondary structure. Second, current lncRNA prediction methods present a bias\ntowards predicting lincRNAs, so new distinguishable features should be extracted for predict-\ning those non-intergenic lncRNAs, thereby helping solve the third problem, that is a more\ndetailed catalogue of lncRNAs needs to be created by classifying the lncRNAs into subclasses\ncorresponding to various functions. Last but not least, it is worth noting that classifying PCTs\nand LNCTs might be meaningless since some lncRNAs can be bifunctional, that is some non-\ncoding RNAs can be translated into peptides in particular circumstances [\n16, 34].\nFig 6. ROC curves of lncRNA prediction on mm10 Testing-B.The description of ROC curves for tests on mm10 Testing-B is the same asFig 3.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654.g006\nA Tool for Predicting lncRNAs Using SVM\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139654 October 5, 2015 12 / 16\nTable 5.

It is hopeful that various datasets\nand novel hypothesis can help improve the prediction accuracy and further deepen our under-\nstanding of lncRNA functions.\nConclusions\nCurrent lncRNA studies have been accelerated by various datasets and efficient bioinformatic\ntools. Here we proposed lncRScan-SVM, which performs better than several popular methods\nin predicting the lncRNAs. lncRScan-SVM is quite useful for lncRNA gene annotation and can\nbe integrated into pipelines of lncRNA study.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Dataset.
