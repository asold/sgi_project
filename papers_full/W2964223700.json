  "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) drugs have been frequently implicated in adverse drug reaction (ADR)-related hospitalizations. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are common preventable cause of ADRs, but the impact of DDIs in the CVD population has not been investigated. Hence, the primary aim of the study was to identify DDIs associated with ADRs in CVD patients at hospital admission. The second aim was to develop a simple tool to identify high-risk patients for DDI-related adverse events. <b>Methods:</b> An observational study was conducted on the Cardiology Ward of University Clinical Hospital Center. Data were obtained from medical charts. A clinical panel identified DDIs implicated in ADRs, using LexiInteract database and Drug Interaction Probability Scale. Statistics were performed using PASW 22 (SPSS Inc.). <b>Results:</b> DDIs contributed to hospital admission with a total prevalence of 9.69%. DDI-related ADRs affected mainly cardiac function (heart rate or rhythm, 41.07%); bleeding and effect on blood pressure were equally distributed (17.86%). Non-cardiovascular ADRs were found in 23.21% of DDIs. After admission, 73% of the identified DDIs led to changes in prescription. Prediction ability of calculated DDI adverse event probability scores was rated as good (AUC = 0.80, <i>p</i> < .001). <b>Conclusions:</b> CVD patients are highly exposed to adverse DDIs; about one in ten patients hospitalized with CVD might have a DDI contributing to the hospitalization. Given the high prevalence of CVD, DDI-related harm might be a significant burden worldwide. Identification of patients with high DDI adverse event risk might ease the recognition of DDI-related harm and improve the use of electronic databases in clinical practice.",
