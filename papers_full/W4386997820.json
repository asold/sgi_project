    "abstract": "ChatGPT is a popular computer program that simulates human communication. It can comprehend normal language and respond in human-like ways. It uses complicated algorithms that have been trained on a large quantity of text data to provide logical responses. This paper explains the design and training process of ChatGPT, as well as its capacity to respond to a range of inquiries. This research also investigates ChatGPT's disadvantages, such as its proclivity to create biased replies, as well as the potential ethical implications of its employment.",
