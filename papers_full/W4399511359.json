  "abstract": "Motivation. Software tests are a necessity in the development of software to secure functionality, reliability, and usability [10]; however, these tests are costly and time-consuming [6]. Although tool support for software testing has advanced, there remains considerable potential for enhancement. Many software tests are still devised manually, with the creation of unit tests being particularly laborious. Automating the generation of test cases is promising for streamlining this aspect of software testing [6].",
