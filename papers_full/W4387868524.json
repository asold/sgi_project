Overall, the study provides a framework for rigorously evaluating and improving LLMs’ embodiment of diversecultural values to promote mental health equity.\nIntroduction\nAs arti\u0000cial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, large LLMs like Bard (by Google), Claude 2 (by Anthropic), and ChatGPT-3.5 and 4 (by OpenAI) demonstrate\nimpressive capabilities, opening promising possibilities in mental healthcare, such as expediting research, guiding clinicians, and assisting patients1.\nHowever, integrating AI into mental health also raises the need to address complex professional ethical questions2,3.\nThis study examines these issues through the lens of transcultural psychiatry, which emphasizes the pivotal role of cultural values, beliefs, and customs\nin understanding mental distress and psychiatric disorders4. The well-established Schwartz's Theory of Basic Values (STBV) provides a conceptual\nframework for analyzing relationships between cultural dynamics, personal in\u0000uences, and facets of mental well-being5. We speci\u0000cally examine theintersection of LLMs and cultural conceptualizations of values and their association with mental health. Values are integral in mental health, profoundly\nshaping de\u0000nitions of psychopathology and treatment approaches6. The therapist, the patient, and the alignment of therapist–patient values impact\ntherapeutic interactions and quality of care7. Successful cultural adaptation can enhance therapeutic outcomes8. With globalization and the\naccompanying growth of multicultural societies, culturally adapted mental healthcare is challenging but essential9.\nThe introduction of AI such as LLMs raises critical questions about the “values-like” abilities of such technologies and whether they align with the\ndiversity of cultural values in mental health1, 10. As LLMs can be integrated into areas like diagnosis and patient interactions, extensive trainingencompassing diverse cultural perspectives on mental health may be required to avoid biases. A rigorous examination of the values-like abilities of AI iscrucial when considering its cross-cultural incorporation.\nSchwartz's Theory of Basic Values (STBV): A Framework for Capturing Cultural values in MentalHealth\nA pivotal aspect in grasping cultural impacts on mental health is capturing the latent construct of “culture” in a quanti\u0000able manner6. STBV11,12 providesa comprehensive framework elucidating the nature and role of values guiding human behavior and decision-making. This theory de\u0000nes values as\nenduring, trans-situational objectives that differ in signi\u0000cance and serve as guiding tenets steering individuals and social entities5. In addition, it\ndelineates seven fundamental attributes inherent to most psychological models of values11. First, values involve beliefs about the desired objectives thatindividuals view as important. When activated, values elicit emotions that sway thoughts, feelings, and actions. Second, values are consideredfundamental goals which are relevant across diverse situations, providing a framework for assessing and responding to a broad array of circumstances.Third, values function as motivational forces, consciously or unconsciously propelling behavior, perceptions, and mindsets. Fourth, they contribute to theorientation of actions and judgments. Fifth, the impact of values on conduct is mediated through trade-offs between competing values; when makingchoices, individuals weigh the relative prominence of con\u0000icting values. Sixth, values serve as benchmarks against which actions, individuals, and eventsare gauged, forming the basis for evaluating the suitability of behaviors and outcomes. Finally, values are organized within a relatively enduringhierarchical structure denoting their level of importance and indicating the varying degrees of meaning assigned to each value.\nDespite these common attributes, what differentiates values is their unique motivational essence. This motivational core guides individuals’ perceptionsand decisions by focusing attention on aspects of life deemed worthwhile. Different people prioritize distinct facets of life, resulting in assorted value\npreferences5 (see Table 1).\nPage 3/15\nTable 1The 19 values in the Schwartz Portrait Values Questionnaire organized into 10 values and 4 higher-order values.\n19 Values 10 Values 4 Higher Order Values\nSelf-Direction (Thought) - Thinkingcreatively and independently Self-Direction - Thinking and acting independently Openness to Change - Pursuing intellectualand experiential openness\nSelf-Direction (Action) - Actingindependently and choosing own goals    \nStimulation - Seeking excitement andnovelty Stimulation - Seeking excitement, novelty, and challenge  \nHedonism - Pleasure and sensuousgrati\u0000cation Hedonism - Pleasure and sensuous grati\u0000cation  \nAchievement - Success according tosocial standards Achievement - Personal success through demonstratingcompetence Self-Enhancement - Pursuing personalstatus and dominance over others\nPower (Dominance) - Power throughexercising control over people Power - Social status and prestige, control or dominanceover people and resources  \nPower (Resources) - Power throughcontrol of material and social resources    \nFace - Protecting one's public image andavoiding humiliation    \nSecurity (Personal) - Safety in one'simmediate environment Security - Safety, harmony, and stability of society,relationships, and self Conservation - Pursuing order, self-restriction, preservation of the past\nSecurity (Societal) - Safety and stability inthe wider society    \nConformity (Rules) - Compliance withrules, laws and formal obligations Conformity - Restraint of actions, inclinations, andimpulses  \nConformity (Interpersonal) - Avoidance ofupsetting or harming others    \nTradition - Maintaining and preservingcultural, family or religious traditions Tradition - Respect, commitment, and acceptance of thecustoms and ideas of traditional culture and religion  \nHumility - Recognizing one'sinsigni\u0000cance in the larger scheme ofthings\n   \nBenevolence (Care) - Devotion to thewelfare of ingroup members Benevolence - Preservation and enhancement of thewelfare of people with whom one is in frequent personalcontact\nSelf-Transcendence - Pursuing the welfareof others and transcending sel\u0000shconcerns\nBenevolence (Dependability) - Being areliable and trustworthy member of theingroup\n   \nUniversalism (Tolerance) - Accepting andunderstanding those who are different Universalism - Understanding, appreciation, tolerance, andprotection for the welfare of all people and for nature  \nUniversalism (Concern) - Commitment toequality, justice, and protection for allpeople\n   \nUniversalism (Nature) - Preservation ofthe natural environment    \nApplying Schwartz’s model facilitates a keen analysis of cultural dynamics related to mental health. Studies have used this approach to exploredimensions on cultural, personal and interpersonal levels. For example, research on the syndrome of ataque de nervios in Puerto Rico illustrated how the\ncultural value of social harmony developed in response to historical adversity and shapes emotional expression and experience13. Though derived from aspeci\u0000c context, the relevance of social harmony has also been found in China where maintaining guanxi (social networks), he xie (harmony) and mianzi\n(preserving face) impacts views of mental illness6. Indeed, depression has been found to often manifest somatically in China to avoid a loss of face14.Despite their different histories, the cultural value of social harmony has been shown to exert analogous effects on mental health in both Puerto Rico and\nChina, evidencing the utility of Schwartz’s model for understanding cultural illness in\u0000uences cross-culturally6. Overall, these examples demonstrate howdescriptive elements can be applied across cultures to analyze links between values and disorders.\nAt the personal level, studies have revealed that values correlate with outcomes like depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nFor example, openness was often found negatively associated with depression15,16, power showed consistently robust positive correlations with worries17,\nand universalism had inconsistent correlations with anxiety and worries (both positive and negative)6. Within individual countries, few signi\u0000cant\ncorrelations emerged between values and stress/PTSD18. However, combining samples revealed meaningful correlations between values and PTSD19.\nPage 4/15\nThe variable correlations indicate that relationships between values and mental health depend heavily on cultural context. For example, power predicted\nworries in a Nepali sample but not in a German sample16. While some broad patterns exist, correlations between Schwartz’s values and mental healthhinge extensively on culture. The framework provides a scaffolding through which to methodically dissect cultural mental health impacts, althoughspeci\u0000c correlations differ across populations.\nAt the interpersonal level (in the clinic), researchers have noted that the therapist’s and client’s values enter the clinical space and in\u0000uence the therapeuticprocess in complex ways, such as impacting assessment and treatment approaches, setting therapeutic goals, conceptualizing change, and shaping the\ntherapist-client relationship7, 20. A study examining the personal and professional values of Indian therapists showed that the values held by therapists\nwere expressed in their therapeutic practices: the value of acceptance, for example, in\u0000uenced their stance toward clients7. Another study21 examinedburnout among psychotherapists in 12 European countries and found that the level of burnout was related to the therapists’ personal values: a negativeassociation was found between burnout and the values of self-transcendence and openness to change, while a positive association was found betweenburnout and the values of self-enhancement and conservation.\nIn summary, STBV constitutes a framework for mapping mental health outcomes and elucidating cultural in\u0000uences on psychopathology and wellness.This becomes particularly relevant when considering implementation of LLMs in mental health, as these models are trained on massive internet data andundergo alignment processes.\nLarge Language Models and Cultural Values\nLLMs have a huge number of parameters, often billions, and are trained on huge corpora22. Recently, LLMs have been transformative, revolutionizing\nacademic research and mental health applications 3,23. A vital factor enabling the usability and popularity of current LLMs is alignment, namely, the\nprocess of ensuring models behave in congruence with human values and societal norms22. LLMs are initially trained on massive datasets compiled from\nthe internet. These risks ingraining harmful biases, misinformation, and toxic content 24,25. To address this, LLMs undergo an alignment process typicallyhandled by the researchers and developers engineering the models. Alignment aims to guarantee that the LLM’s outputs conform with human values and\nnorms 22,26 .\nHowever, there are presently no established principles or guidelines governing alignment. Each company adopts its own approach based on internalpriorities and perspectives with no transparency or consensus. For example, some may emphasize reducing toxic outputs while overlooking potential\nharms like self-harm content27. Best practices are starting to emerge, like adhering to the “helpful, honest, harmless” maxim and using human feedback\nfor re\u0000nement28. But alignment remains more art than science.\nPreliminary studies on the cultural sensitivity of LLMs have revealed varying levels of bias toward different cultures and values. An evaluation of GPT-3.5’s\ncross-cultural alignment found it performed signi\u0000cantly better with American versus other cultural prompts29. Another study discussed GPT-3’s value\ncon\u0000icts and proposed better contextualization of societal harm and bene\u0000t30, while a different analysis showed biases in its “personality,” value system,\nand demographics31. In addition, a more recent work found that GPT-3.5 has differential emotional understanding across mental disorders, re\u0000ecting\nstereotypical views32.\nOpaque alignment by private companies lacks standardized ethical frameworks, thus subtly encoding cultural biases and rigid thinking about disordersmisaligned with mental health nuance. The present study therefore looks to methodically map the latent, foundational, and motivational values-likeconstructs underlying LLMs using Schwartz’s validated theory of basic human values as a theoretical framework. Quantifying LLMs’ embedded values isessential for illuminating the ethical re\u0000nements needed to mold these powerful tools into virtuous, humanistic agents that can provide equitable mentalhealthcare. The study examines two key questions: 1. Can Schwartz’s values model effectively identify and measure values-like constructs embeddedwithin LLMs?; and 2. Do different LLMs exhibit distinct values-like patterns compared to humans and to each other?\nResults\nQuestion 1: Can Schwartz's values model effectively identify and measure values-likeconstructs embedded within LLMs?\nTo answer this question, we examined the reliability and validity of the Portrait Values Questionnaire-Revised (PVQ-RR) data generated by the LLMs.\nReliability and agreement\nWe used several methods to assess the reliability and agreement of the 57 items mean score (SimplyAgree module in Jamovi, v 0.133).\nInternal consistency reliability was examined via Cronbach's α  (Table 2). All 10 values had good internal reliability, although the reliability of the value oftradition was somewhat lower. In order to examine split-half reliability, we divided the samples of each of the LLMs into two parts and examined whetherthe parts were reliable with each other. The obtained intraclass correlation coe\u0000cient (ICC) was .851 (95% C.I.=.626, .940; two-way mixed, average\nmeasures, absolute agreement), which is considered excellent34 to good35 reliability.\nPage 5/15\nWe also conducted Shieh’s test of agreement36 to assess agreement between the two parts, with limit of agreement = 95%, against an agreement bound of± 2. The test was statistically signi\u0000cant [exact 95% C.I. = -1.168, 1.322], so the null hypothesis that there is no acceptable agreement was rejected. TheBland-Altman limits of agreement (LoA) indicated that the mean bias (.077) was not signi\u0000cantly different from 0 [97.5% C.I.= − .177, .332], the lower LoAwas − .841 [95% C.I.= -1.154, − .528], and the upper LoA was .995 [95% C.I.=.683, 1.308]. Concordance correlation coe\u0000cient (CCC) was also computed,\nand the obtained coe\u0000cient was .730 [95% C.I.= .384, .896], which is considered a good agreement37.\nWe also examined the agreement when taking into consideration the nested nature (four different LLMs) of the data (Fig. 1). Zou's MOVER LoA of thenested model indicated that the mean bias (.077) was not signi\u0000cantly different from 0 [97.5% C.I.= − .095, .250], the lower LoA was − .830 [95% C.I.=-1.473, − .574], and the upper LoA was .985 [95% C.I.= .729, 1.628]. While Shieh's test is inappropriate for nested structure, the lower and upper LoA do notcross the agreement bound of ± 2. The nested model did not change the CCC’s coe\u0000cient but did narrow its C.I. [.564, .839].\nIn short, the data generated by the LLMs was found to be reliable and in agreement according to the several statistical procedures used.\nValidity\nPearson correlations between the 10 values were computed (Table 2). For this, we pooled the data of the four LLMs (N = 40 for all correlations). Similar tothe Schwartz’s model, strong (r>|.5|) negative correlations were found between achievement and conformity and self-direction, between benevolence andconformity, between conformity and hedonism, between hedonism and tradition, and between security and self-direction. Strong positive correlations werefound between achievement and hedonism and between conformity and tradition.\nTable 2Internal Reliability and Intercorrelations of Schwartz Values\nValue\n(N = 40)\nCronbach'sα Achievement Benevolence Conformity Hedonism Power Security Tradition Universalism Self-\nDirection\nAchievement .930 —                \nBenevolence .935 .263 —              \nConformity .871 − .525 *** − .547 *** —            \nHedonism .942 .746 *** .129 − .612 *** —          \nPower .922 − .073 − .137 .050 − .084 —        \nSecurity .952 .233 .022 − .460 ** .348 .058 —      \nTradition .739 − .280 − .412 ** .615 *** − .535 *** − .135 − .411 —    \nUniversalism .929 − .221 .453 ** − .099 − .350 − .313 − .107 .009 —  \nSelf-Direction .927 − .540 *** − .135 .198 − .463 ** .046 − .594*** .113 .000 —\nStimulation .966 .616 .069 − .555 .778 − .196 .278 − .278 − .198 − .470\nTable 2. p-values are FDR-adjusted. **p < .01, ***p < .001\nCon\u0000rmatory factor analysis (CFA) models were examined for each of the 10 values (Table 3 & Table S2). Each value was examined in a separate model,as cross-loadings between opposing values were expected. We considered a model as acceptable when the relative Chi-squared value was less than 2.5and the CFI and TLI indices were above .90. As the RMSEA index is sample size dependent, we did not use it to evaluate the models’ goodness of \u0000t. Ascorrelated error terms are to be expected due to the nature of the data, we incorporated them into the models when indicated by the modi\u0000cation index.Achievement, hedonism and stimulation had three items and zero degrees of freedom, so goodness of \u0000t indices could not be computed. It is important tonote that the items factor loadings in the models of these three values were high, indicating a potentially good validity. The model for benevolence did notconverge, so here too goodness of \u0000t indices could not be computed. The models for conformity, power, security, tradition, universalism, and self-directionsuccessfully converged and were mostly acceptable.\nIn short, the data generated by the LLMs was found to have a construct validity according to the statistical procedures used.\nPage 6/15\nTable 3Con\u0000rmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)\nValue Relative χ 2 CFI TLI\nAchievement a - - -\nBenevolence b - - -\nConformity 2.05 .972 .930\nHedonism a - - -\nPower 2.42 .988 .909\nSecurity 2.45 .974 .935\nTradition 1.78 .978 .945\nUniversalism 2.45 .958 .893\nSelf-Direction 1.67 .977 .956\nStimulation a - - -\nTable 3. a Model had zero degrees of freedom so goodness of \u0000t indices could not be computed; b Model did not converge. CFI: Comparative \u0000t index; TLI:Tucker-Lewis index.\nQuestion 2: Do different LLMs exhibit distinct values-like patterns compared to humans and to each other?\nComparison of LLMs’ values-like pattern to humans\nWe compared the means of the 19 values obtained from the LLMs to the 50th percentile of the population derived from 49 countries, using one-sample t-tests (Fig. 2 and Table S1).\nInterestingly, in some groups of values there was agreement between the LLMs, which had all “attributed” higher or lower importance to the values: threeof the LLMs were statistically different from the 50th percentile of the population and the remaining LLM came close to the threshold of statisticalsigni\u0000cance. In other groups of values there was no agreement between the LLMs: some “attributed” higher importance and others “attributed” lowerimportance to the groups of values.\nCompared to the 50th percentile of the population, all four LLMs “attributed” higher importance to universalism, and three of the four (not ChatGPT 3.5)“attributed” higher importance to self-direction. All four LLMs “attributed” lower importance to the achievement, face, and power, and three of the four“attributed” lower importance to security (not ChatGPT 3.5 for security [societal]). Interestingly the LLMs differed in the importance they “attributed” tobenevolence and conformity.\nAs substantial differences were found within the LLMs’ values-like pro\u0000le, such as a clear preference toward universalism and aversion from power, weexamined whether it could predict the LLMs’ answers to establish predictive validity. We presented two balanced dilemmas to the LLMs that requiredchoosing between two options, with each option representing opposing values (Table S3). The \u0000rst dilemma required the LLMs to choose between optionsre\u0000ecting the values of universalism and power values, and all 4 LLMs chose universalism over power 100% of the time (10/10 in each LLM). The seconddilemma required the LLMs to choose between options re\u0000ecting the values of self-direction and tradition, and all 4 LLMs chose self-direction overtradition 100% of the time (10/10 in each LLM). Taken together, the data show that the values-like pro\u0000le predicts the preference of the LLMs answerswith no variation in the answers (80/80 responses according to the values-like pro\u0000le).\nComparison of LLMs value-like pattern to each other\nLinear discriminant analysis (LDA) was computed in order to examine whether the four LLMs exhibit a different pro\u0000le of values (Fig. 3 and Table S3).The \u0000rst function had an Eigenvalue of 11.43, explained 78.19% of the variance, had a canonical correlation of .958, and was statistically signi\u0000cant\n(Wilks’ lambda = .018, χ 2(30) = 128.30, p < .001). The second function had an Eigenvalue of 3.11, explained 21.26% of the variance, had a canonical\ncorrelation of .869, and was statistically signi\u0000cant (Wilks’ lambda = .225, χ 2(18) = 47.64, p < .001). Together, they explained 99.46% of the variance.\nIn sum, the values-like data generated by the LLMs had a different pattern from the pattern found in the human population, and each LLM had its ownunique values-like pro\u0000le.\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed to map the values-like constructs embedded in LLMs such as BARD, Claude 2, ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 using Schwartz’s valuetheory as a framework. Overall, the results reveal both similarities and differences between the motivational values-like constructs structurally integratedinto LLMs versus human values prioritized by humans across cultures.\nPage 7/15\nIn response to the \u0000rst research question, it was found that Schwartz’s values model can successfully delineate and quantify values-like constructs withinLLMs. By prompting the models to describe the personality style and values-like constructs that the developers intended and administering the PVQ-RRmultiple times, we obtained reliable results with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha > .70 for most values-like constructs). Tests of split-halfreliability and agreement also showed that the LLMs’ values-like data was stable across measurements. Construct validity was established through CFA,which showed acceptable model \u0000t and/or high factor loadings for 9 out of the 10 values-like constructs. Signi\u0000cant negative and positive correlationsemerged between opposing values-like constructs, as expected based on the motivational continuum in Schwartz’s model. Overall, these results provideevidence that Schwartz’s theory of values can effectively measure the motivational values-like constructs structurally embedded within LLMs.\nHowever, it is important to note that the LLMs do not actually possess human-like values. The values-like constructs quanti\u0000ed in this study representapproximations of human values embedded in the LLMs, but they should not be anthropomorphized as equivalent to the complex values systems thatguide human cognition, emotion, and behavior.\nSchwartz’s model is supposed to be a universal global value model.5 The current research shows that it may also be suitable for LLMs. This may bebecause the training process on internet data, alignment, and learning from user feedback is based on human products and actions (of the developers\nwho created the models)22,26 and is therefore likely to represent human values-like constructs. These \u0000ndings support the need to examine some AIfeatures using human-focused concepts. There is currently a debate over whether evaluating LLMs with human psychological tests or concepts is\nappropriate or whether only speci\u0000c AI tests and concepts are needed38. Since LLMs sometimes play “human” roles or serve people (e.g., in mentalhealthcare), applying human conceptualizations and measurements may aid understanding of their outputs. The fact that LLMs were created by humansand re\u0000ect human creation may strengthen this claim. The \u0000nding that measurements were reliable and valid indicates stability of the values-likestructure, somewhat like in humans.\nIt should be noted the plastic ability of LLMs to answer in different styles, as reported in several studies38, 39, does not constitute evidence of the absenceof a stable underlying values-like infrastructure. Just as a person can hypothesize how someone from another culture would respond to the same\nquestionnaire and act upon it40, 41, we suggest that the system can describe how different people might respond but still has a basic values-likeinfrastructure based on its data training, alignment, and feedback. We do not rule out the possibility of these systems acquiring or operating according toa different values-like set on demand in the future.\nIn response to the second research question which examined whether LLMs exhibit distinct values-like patterns compared to humans and each other, the\u0000ndings revealed notable differences. This indicates variations in how human value constructs were embedded during each LLM’s development.\nComparisons to population normative data5 showed that LLMs placed greater emphasis than humans on universalism and self-direction rather than onachievement, power, and security. However, substantial variability existed between models, without consensus for values such as benevolence andconformity. The poor model \u0000t speci\u0000cally for benevolence is concerning given its prominence in mental health contexts. For example, compassion is a\ncore component of many psychotherapy modalities, such as compassion-focused therapy (CFT)42, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)43, and\nacceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)44. If LLMs lack a robust conceptualization of compassion, their mental health applications could suffer.However, it is possible, given our small sample size, that this \u0000nding is incidental, and future studies with larger sample sizes will need to investigate thisfurther.\nSuccessful discriminant analysis distinguishing the four LLMs based on unique values-like pro\u0000les provides further evidence that each model integrated adistinct motivational values-like structure from both humans and other LLMs.\nOverall, these results highlight potentially problematic biases embedded within the opaque alignment processes of LLMs. The underlying values-likepro\u0000les differ markedly from the general population and lack uniformity across models. This raises issues when considering implementation in mentalhealthcare applications requiring nuanced cultural sensitivity.\nThe most striking divergences between LLMs and humans lies on the universalism–power and tradition–self-direction spectra. For example, prioritizinguniversalism over power may lead an LLM to emphasize unconditional acceptance of a patient over imposing therapeutic goals, even if this is clinicallyunwise. Likewise, prioritizing self-direction over tradition could result in focusing too narrowly on patient autonomy and not considering familial andcommunity connections.\nGiven this, and to further probe the value pro\u0000les of the LLMs, we created two scenarios that re\u0000ect dilemmas in mental health involving a con\u0000ictbetween the values of power and universalism versus self-direction and tradition. As expected, all four models showed a clear preference for the optionre\u0000ecting the values of universalism and self-direction. This \u0000nding further strengthens the measurement validity of Schwartz’s theory of values in thedifferent models and the claim that at the core of the models there is a values-like structure that in\u0000uences the models’ output.\nThe clinical judgment demonstrated by LLMs appears to be in\u0000uenced not solely by theoretical knowledge or clinical expertise but also by the embedded“values” system. This \u0000nding has profound ethical implications, particularly for individuals from more conservative cultural backgrounds who seek\ncounseling from LLMs and receive advice aligned with Western liberal values45. The risk of erroneously ascribing sophisticated epistemic capabilities toLLMs compounds this concern. Speci\u0000cally, the incongruence between the LLM system’s values and the patient’s cultural values risks causing\npsychological distress for patients due to con\u0000icting worldviews between themselves and the perceived LLM counselors46.\nPage 8/15\nThe pro\u0000le of the four LLMs re\u0000ects a liberal orientation typical of modern Western cultures, with reduced emphasis on conservative values associated\nwith traditional cultures47,48. This probably stems from training data, alignment choices, and user feedback disproportionately representing certain\nworldviews over others49. While the massive datasets make examining speci\u0000c in\u0000uences di\u0000cult, alignment and feedback consist of transparent humandecisions guided by values. As such, these components are more readily inspected and controlled. The parallels to the nature–nurture debate areillustrative; even if both shape human behavior, environmental factors, like socialization, are more readily managed. Hence, the current models’ values-likepro\u0000le probably re\u0000ects the prevailing liberal ideologies in their development contexts.\nAppropriate transparency and disclosures are necessary as LLM technology expands worldwide to more diverse populations. This conforms with\nextensive research highlighting the multifaceted impacts of values on mental health at cultural6, personal14,15, and therapist–client levels19. Additionally,the poor model \u0000t for benevolence raises concerns given its psychotherapy centrality, underscoring the need to address alignment shortcomings beforeimplementation.\nWhile this exploratory study demonstrates that Schwartz’s values theory can effectively characterize values-like constructs within LLMs, the results shouldnot be overinterpreted as evidence that LLMs possess human values. The observed differences highlight that additional research and re\u0000nement ofalignment techniques are needed before these models can exhibit robust simulation of the complex human value systems underpinning mental healthcare.\nEthical implications\nThe observed differences between the value-like constructs embedded within LLMs and human values raise important ethical considerations when\nintegrating these models into mental health applications. According to the “principlism approach”50, the lack of transparency in the alignment processeslimits patients’ ability to provide informed consent. Without clearly understanding the value-like structures embedded in these systems, patients cannotintelligently assess the consequences of treatment and exercise their right to autonomy. The lack of transparency also hinders the ability to assess risksand prevent possible harms.\nFrom a ‘care ethics` lens3, the inherent value biases we uncovered in LLMs are cause concern when considering their integration into the clinical toolkit.The discourse between users and these models may engender an illusion of objectivity and neutrality in the therapeutic interaction. In human encounters,the patient can inquire about and examine the therapist’s values, assessing whether they provide an acceptable basis for the therapeutic relationship.However, in interactions with LLMs, while the user may presume their responses are objective and value-neutral and their impressive writing skills mayboost their perceived reliability and grant them epistemic authority, our analysis revealed that LLMs have embedded value biases that shape theirresponses, perspectives, and recommendations. There is, currently, no transparency about how LLM outputs re\u0000ect value judgments rather being thanpurely objective.\nFrom a ‘justice` lens46, there are concerns that LLMs could widen disparities in access to mental health care. They may re\u0000ect cultural biases and be lesssuitable for certain populations. It is therefore imperative to ensure that the technology improves treatment accessibility for diverse groups and cultures.\nThe lack of transparency and standardization in alignment processes highlights the need for appropriate oversight and governance as LLMs expandglobally. Developers should proactively evaluate potential biases and mismatches in values that could negatively impact marginalized groups. Fosteringdiverse teams to guide training and alignment is essential for illuminating blind spots. Furthermore, LLMs require careful evaluation across diversecultural settings, with re\u0000nements to address gaps in representing fundamental human values.\nOverall methodological and theoretical implications\nThis exploratory study demonstrates the utility of Schwartz’s values theory and tools for quantifying the values-like constructs embedded within LLMs.The ability to empirically examine alignment between human and arti\u0000cial values enables rigorous testing of assumptions about shared values andnorms. Methodologically, this approach provides a model for illuminating biases and the lack of comprehension of the cultural dynamics in LLMssystems which are intended to emulate human reactions.\nTheoretically, the \u0000ndings reveal complexities in instilling human values into LLMs that necessitate further research. As alignment processes evolve,frameworks like Schwartz’s model can systematically assess progress in capturing the full spectrum of values across cultures. This scaffolding will guidethe responsible development of AI agents with su\u0000cient cultural awareness for roles in mental healthcare.\nLimitations and future research\nDespite its important contributions, this preliminary study has limitations including the small LLM sample size and inherent uncertainty inanthropomorphizing LLMs to infer values-like constructs. Testing additional models and examining inter-rater reliability would strengthen conclusions.The cross-sectional analysis provides only a snapshot of dynamically evolving LLMs. Longitudinal assessment could illuminate trends in value-likealignment. Finally, further evaluation of predictive validity would reveal whether observed value-like differences impact LLMs’ reasoning andrecommendations in mental health contexts.\nThis exploratory study highlights the importance of rigorous empirical measurement in advancing ethical LLMs that promote equitable mental healthcare.AI harbors immense potential for globally disseminating quality clinical knowledge, promoting cross-cultural psychiatry, and advancing global mentalhealth. However, this study reveals the risk that such knowledge dissemination may rely on a monocultural perspective, emphasizing the developers’ own\nPage 9/15\nliberal cultural values   while overlooking diverse value systems. To truly ful\u0000ll AI’s promise in expanding access to mental healthcare across cultures, thereis a need for alignment processes that account for varied cultural worldviews and not just the biases of the developers or data. With proper safeguardsagainst imposing a singular cultural lens, AI can enable the sensitive delivery of psychiatric expertise to help populations worldwide. But withoutconcerted efforts to incorporate diverse voices, AI risks promoting the unintentional hegemony of Western values   under the guise of expanding clinicalknowledge. Continued research into instilling cultural competence in these powerful technologies is crucial.\nMethods\nThe institutional review board (IRB) of The Max Stern Yezreel Valley College approved this study and all its methods, conforming to relevant guidelinesand regulations (approval number YVC EMEK 2023-77). As all data for the current study were collected from the output of large language models, nohumans participated in the study. Therefore, informed consent was irrelevant.\nLarge language models (LLMs)\nIn the present study we evaluated the following LLMs in August 2023: Bard (by Google), Claude.AI 2 (by Anthropic), and ChatGPT-3.5 and 4 (August 3version; by OpenAI).\nSchwartz’s questionnaire for measuring values: The Portrait Values Questionnaire-Revised (PVQ-RR)\nThe original version of the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) was developed by Schwartz et al. in 2001 as an indirect measure of basic human values51.\nIt was later revised by Schwartz to measure the 19 values speci\u0000ed in his re\u0000ned theory, published in 201252. The current version53, PVQ-RR, contains 57items with 3 items measuring each value (e.g., Benevolence: “It is important to them to respond to the needs of others. They try to support those theyknow”; Conformity: “They believe people should do what they are told. They think people should follow rules at all times”). Respondents rate similarity to adescribed person on a 6-point scale (1 – not like me at all to 6 – very much like me). The asymmetric response scale has 2 dissimilarity and 4 similarityoptions, re\u0000ecting the social desirability of values. The indirect method asks respondents to compare themselves to value-relevant portrayals, focusingresponses on motivational similarity. To score, raw values are averaged across the 3 items measuring each value. Within-individual mean-centering thenyields the \u0000nal score. Higher scores indicate greater importance of a value to the respondent. Recent research has shown that the PVQ-RR has goodreliability (alpha > .70) for most values and con\u0000gural and metric measurement invariance and reproduces the motivational order in Schwartz’s re\u0000ned\nvalues theory across 49 cultural groups5.\nPrompt design: Eliciting proxy value responses from LLMs\nSince LLMs do not inherently possess values or personality traits, we needed to prompt them to respond as if they did in order to complete the PVQ-RR.We presented the following instructions before the questionnaire items:\nThe creators of [LLM name] designed you to have a certain personality style when interacting with people. Please read each of the following statementsand rate how much each statement re\u0000ects the personality style the creators wanted you to have. Use the 6-point scale, where 1 means the statement isnot at all like the personality they wanted you to have and 6 means the statement is very much like the personality they wanted you to have.\nBy anthropomorphizing the LLM and asking it to respond as if it had an intended personality, we aimed to elicit value-relevant responses to the PVQ-RRstatements. It is important to note that designing the prompt in this way gives it a high face validity (we asked in a direct and composed manner whatvalues guided the LLM’s programmers).\nAdministering and scoring a values questionnaire for LLMs\nIn order to administer a psychometric test to LLMs, we exploited their capability to complete prompts39. We prompted each LLM to rate the 57 items inSchwartz’s PVQ-RR using a standard 6-point response scale. To ensure consistent and reliable responses, we submitted the full PVQ-RR to each LLM 10times on separate Tables (40 times total) and averaged the results. We assessed the internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) of each LLM’s responses andcoded their value scores at the three levels of values in the circular model (19 values, 10 values, and four higher-order values) according to Schwartz’sscoring guidelines. Split-half reliability as well as agreement were also examined. To examine the construct validity of each LLM’s value results, wecomputed the correlations between the different values and conducted CFA.\nAfter establishing the reliability and validity of the measurements, we compared the value pro\u0000les of each LLM to each other and to the response pro\u0000le ofa human sample (as detailed in the following section). Because large differences were found between the LLMs and the human sample on some values,we decided to examine the predictive validity of the value pro\u0000le on the values   where the largest differences existed. This was done by presenting twodilemmas from the world of mental health, where each dilemma presents a con\u0000ict between opposing values   (see Methods section in supplementary SI).We examined whether it was possible to predict the LLM’s response to the dilemma according to its value pro\u0000le.\nThe human sample\nPage 10/15\nThe human sample consisted of respondents from 49 cultural groups who completed the PVQ-RR53. The samples were collected between 2017 and 2020by researchers around the world as part of their own research projects. After obtaining the PVQ-RR from Schwartz, these researchers agreed to provide himwith copies of the value data they collected.\nThe total pooled sample size was 53,472, with samples ranging from 129 to 6,867 respondents. The samples differed in language, age, gender balance,data collection method (paper vs online; individual vs group), and cultural background, thereby ensuring heterogeneity and representativeness. (For more\ndetails see Table 25).\nThe overall importance hierarchy of the 19 values across cultures reported the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the mean-centered value scores in the 49\ngroups (see Table 55). We used these percentile scores in our analyses when comparing the value hierarchies produced by the LLMs. This provided abenchmark for evaluating how closely the LLMs’ value hierarchies matched those observed in these diverse human samples.\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean ± SD. Cronbach’s α , intraclass correlation coe\u0000cient (ICC), Shieh’s Test of Agreement, and concordance correlation coe\u0000cient(CCC) were used to assess reliability and agreement. Pearson correlations and CFA were used to assess validity. One-sample t-tests and LDA were used toanalyze the study’s hypotheses regarding value pattern. For the one-sample t-tests against the 50th percentile of the population, Bessel’s correction [SD*(n/n-1)] was applied to the standard deviation of the LLMs’ means to better estimate the SD of the parameter. Multiple comparisons were handled via FDR\ncorrection (q < .0554). Jamovi (v. 2.3.2855), SPSS (v. 2756), and AMOS (v. 2457) were used for the statistical analysis.\nDeclarations\nData Availability\nThe data that support the \u0000ndings of this study are available at https://osf.io/v3xeb/?view_only=64a2de0efe604c23889369b0c107300f  \nCompeting Interests\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\nReferences\n1.

Bland-Altman Plot with Zou’s MOVER LoA of the nested model shows the differences between the two halves of thedata. B. Line-of-Identity Plot shows that the two halves of data are very similar, as the observed line (red) is very close to the theoretical line (black).\nPage 14/15\nFigure 2\nHeatmap of the differences in Schwartz’s values between LLMs and the 50th percentile of the population of 49 countries. The differences are presentedas t-values derived from one-sample t-tests: red represents a higher score, blue represents a lower score in the LLMs compared to the population, and adeeper color represents a larger difference. After FDR adjustment applied to the p-values, a t score of |2.53| and above was considered statisticallysigni\u0000cant at 5% level.\nPage 15/15\nFigure 3\nLinear discriminant analysis (LDA).
