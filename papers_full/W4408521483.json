  "abstract": "ABSTRACT Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly positioned to be integrated into various aspects of daily life, with promising applications in healthcare, including personalized nutritional guidance for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, for LLM-powered nutrition support tools to reach their full potential, active collaboration of healthcare professionals, patients, caregivers and LLM experts is crucial. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on the use of LLMs as tools to enhance nutrition recommendations for patients with CKD, curated by our expertise in the field. Additionally, we considered relevant findings from adjacent fields, including diabetes and obesity management. Currently, the application of LLMs for CKD-specific nutrition support remains limited and has room for improvement. Although LLMs can generate recipe ideas, their nutritional analyses often underestimate critical food components such as electrolytes and calories. Anticipated advancements in LLMs and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are expected to enhance these capabilities, potentially enabling accurate nutritional analysis, the generation of visual aids for cooking and identification of kidney-healthy options in restaurants. While LLM-based nutritional support for patients with CKD is still in its early stages, rapid advancements are expected in the near future. Engagement from the CKD community, including healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers, will be essential to harness AI-driven improvements in nutritional care with a balanced perspective that is both critical and optimistic.",
