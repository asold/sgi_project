  "abstract": "Energising a transformer with other adjacent transformers in service may induce sympathetic inrush that could lead to long duration voltage dips. This study addresses this issue through analysing voltage dip events observed on a 400/132 kV grid when energisations of several generator step‐up transformers were performed. With the help of a number of field measurements of voltage dips involving sympathetic inrush, a detailed network model in alternative transients program/electromagnetic transients program has been developed and validated. Based on the network model, comprehensive simulation studies have been performed. In addition, because of the nature of multiple controlling parameters, sensitivity assessment has been carried out to identify the key influential parameters. It is found that the sympathetic inrush, although does not affect voltage dip magnitude, can prolong voltage dip duration by 143% under the worst energisation condition. The sympathetic inrush occurring in substation transformers gives rise to a network‐wide sympathetic interaction, resulting in further prolonged voltage dips on the 132 kV grid. Finally, it is proven that application of static var compensator is able to speed up the voltage dip recovery.",
