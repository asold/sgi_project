INTRODUCTION\nImpedance transformers are basic building blocks for microwave\ncomponents such as power ampliﬁers, power dividers, antennas.\nRecently as dual-band microwave components are becoming a trend [1–\n16], the demand for dual-frequency impedance transformers has been\nincreasing. Dual-frequency impedance matching were ﬁrstly realized\nbetween real impedances [17, 18]. In [17] two sections of transmission\nline of same length are cascaded to realize a dual-frequency transformer\nbetween real impedance load and real impedance source. L-shaped\nnetwork containing a transmission line and a shunt stub can also\nrealize the same function [18]. As it is usually demanded to realize\nReceived 12 December 2011, Accepted 20 February 2012, Scheduled 10 March 2012\n* Corresponding author: Yun Liu (lycloud1978@163.com).\n122 Liu, Zhao, and Zhou\nimpedance matching from complex loads (such as the input or output\nimpedance of a power ampliﬁer) to a real-impedance source new\ntechniques are proposed [19–22]. In [19] two unequal transmission line\nsections are cascaded to realize dual-frequency impedance matching\nfor a frequency-independent complex load. As to frequency-dependent\ncomplex loads, a three-section impedance transformer is proposed\nin [20] to realize dual-frequency impedance matching. As an alternative\nof [20], two sections of transmission lines and a two-section shunt\nstub are cascaded to form a dual-frequency impedance transformer\nat the expense of big dimension [21]. A T-shaped network is also\nintroduced for dual-frequency matching for complex loads [22]. In\na more general problem, [23] discusses the situation in which both\nthe source and the load are complex and frequency dependent in\nimpedance, and a circuit containing four sections of transmission lines\nis adopted. The above distributive impedance transformers are always\nbulky especially when the operating frequencies are below several\nGHzs, so some lumped and hybrid types of dual-frequency transformers\nare also developed for decreasing the dimensions [24, 25]. In [24] single-\nband impedance transformers which are constructed by transmission\nlines and lumped tanks are cascaded to form multi-band transformers.\nA frequency mapping technique is adopted in [25] to synthesis a\ndual-frequency transformer which is realized with lumped elements,\nbut the technique is only limited to conduct impedance matching\nbetween real impedances. In this paper, traditionalL type impedance\ntransformers are extended while lumped circuit blocks are used to\nrealize frequency-dependent reactances and admittances. According to\nthe dual-frequency allocation of a complex load in Smith chart, three\ntypes of topologies are presented. The new impedance transformers\ncontain limited number of lumped elements and are much compacter\nthan transformers constructed by transmission lines.\n2. THEORY\n2.1. Topologies and Matching Processes\nFigure 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) are twoL-network impedance transformers\n(type I and type II) which were commonly used for single-frequency\nimpedance matching in the past. Type-I L-network is suitable for\nimpedance matching of a complex load which is located outside the\n1 +jx circle (unit resistance circle) while type-IIL-network is for a\ncomplex impedance located outside the 1 +jb circle (unit conductance\ncircle).\nIf the normalized impedances (referring to matched impedance\nZ0) of a frequency-dependent load at two speciﬁed frequencies (f1 and\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 126, 2012 123\nf2) are: zl(fn) =zln (n = 1, 2), then three cases can be classiﬁed: A),\nzl1 and zl2 are both located outside the 1 +jx circle; B), zl1 and zl2\nare both outside of the 1 +jb circle; C),zl1 and zl2 are located within\nthe 1 +jb and the 1 +jx circle, respectively. It should be noted that\nit can be classiﬁed into either case A or case B whenzl1 and zl2 are\n11\n22\nl\nl\nl\nza tfz za tf\nL1\nL2\nB2\nB1\nO\nO\nL1\nL2\nL2'\nL1\nL2\nA1\nA2\nO\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nZ in Z in1\njbp\njxs =\nZ in Z in1\njxs jbp\n11\n22\nl\nl\nl\nza tfz za tf=\nZ in Z in1\nZ in2\n11\n22\nl\nl\nl\nza tfz za tf=jbp1\njxs\njbp\nFigure 1. Topologies of dual-frequency impedance transformers.\n(a) L1 and L2 are outside of 1 +jx circle. (b) L1 and L2 are outside of\n1 +jb circle r. (c) L1 and L2 are within 1 +jb circle and 1 +jx circle\nrespectively.\n124 Liu, Zhao, and Zhou\nboth outside the two circles.\nCase A: Each ofzl1 and zl2 can separately get matched via a type-\nI L-Network with certain values ofjbp and jxs, thus they can share\none type-IL-network provided that thejbp and jxs blocks can aﬀord\nrequired susceptances and reactances atf1 and f2, respectively. We\ncan see the matching processes in the Smith chart of Fig. 1(a). Here\nL1 and L2 are the positions of the complex impedances atf1 and f2.\nBy serially connecting thejxs block, the input impedances at the two\nfrequencies run fromL1 and L2 to A1 and A2 via resistance circles.\nHere A1 and A2 are required to be located on the 1 +jb circle. The\nvalues ofxs are given as below:\nxs(fn) =±\n√\nrln − r2\nln − xln n = 1, 2 (1)\nHere rln and xln are the real and imaginary parts ofzln. By\nparallel connecting the shunt admittance ofjbp, the impedances run\non the 1 +jb circle and reach the matching point O respectively. The\nvalues ofbp are:\nbp(fn) = xs(fn) +xln\nr2\nln + (xs(fn) +xln)2 n = 1, 2 (2)\nCase B: Ifzl1 and zl2 are both outside of the 1 +jb circle, they can\nshare one type-IIL-network and concurrently get matched if the serial\nand shunt circuit blocks have needed reactances and suceptances at the\ntwo frequencies. As shown in the Smith chart of Fig. 1(b), the input\nimpedances start fromL1 and L2 and reachB1 and B2 via conductance\ncircles. Here B1 and B2 are located on the 1 +jx circle. This is\nrealized by parallel connecting ajbp block whose susceptances at the\ntwo frequencies are:\nbp(fn) = ±\n√\ngln − g2\nln − bln n = 1, 2 (3)\nHere gln and bln are the real and imaginary parts of the complex\nadmittances of the load. Then by serially connecting a jxs block,\nthe imaginary part ofzin1 is compensated at both the two frequencies\nresulting in matched input impedancezin. As a corresponding process\nin the Smith chart, the impedances go fromB1 and B2 and arrive at\nthe matching point O respectively. The formula of the serial reactances\nare as below:\nxs(fn) = bp(fn) +bln\ng2\nln + (bp(fn) +bln)2 n = 1, 2 (4)\nCase C: Ifzl1 and zl2 are located within 1 +jb circle and 1 +jx circle\nrespectively, zl1 can get matched using a type-IIL-network andzl2 can\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 126, 2012 125\nbe matched by a type-IIL-network, but they can not share the sameL-\nnetwork. For the purpose of dual-frequency impedance matching, the\nﬁrst step is to convert case C to case A or B. As shown in Fig. 1(c),\nthe load is ﬁrstly parallel connected with a susceptancejbp1 under the\nconstraint condition thatbp1(f1) = 0, thus the input impedance atf1\nkeeps unchanged in the Smith chart while the input impedance atf2\nruns on a conductance circle and reachesL′\n2 which is on the vertical\naxe (the real part of reﬂection coeﬃcient is zero), being outside of the\n1 +jx circle. After this we can follow the same matching procedure as\ncase A. We give the needed susceptance atf2 as:\nbp1(f2) =±\n√\n1 − g2\nl2 − bl2 (5)\n2.2. Lumped Blocks for Dual-frequency Susceptances and\nReactances\nAn important task in realizing the dual-frequency impedance\ntransformers of Fig. 1 is to construct lumped blocks which aﬀord\nthe needed values of susceptances or reactances at two speciﬁed\nfrequencies.\nTo realize various two-frequency susceptances, four types of\nlumped circuit blocks as shown in Fig. 2 can be adopted. The\nsusceptance of a parallelLC block in Fig. 2(a) is monotone increasing\nthus suitable for the case thatbp(f2) is greater thanbp(f1). Serial\nLC block as shown in Fig. 2(b) is suitable for the case thatbp(f1) is\npositive and bp(f2) is negative For the case that 0≥ bp(f1) > bp(f2),\nan inductor should be parallel connected to a serialLC resonator as\nshown in Fig. 2(c). On the contrary, if we needbp(f1) > bp(f2) > 0,\nwe need to parallel connect a capacitor with the serialLC resonator,\nas shown in Fig. 2(d).\nBased on the needed values of susceptances at two frequencies we\ncan have two equations with two or three unknowns. For the cases of\nFig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), the element values can be directly solved. For\nthe other two cases, we should select the value of one element and the\nother two unknowns can be solved then.\nAs to the serial reactances, we also have four types of circuit\nblocks as shown in Fig. 4. We choose the suitable serial circuit blocks\naccording to the needed values ofxs(f1) andxs(f2).\n3. DESIGN EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSIONS\nWe construct a frequency-dependent complex load which contains an\ninductor Ll = 5 nH, a capacitorCl = 1 pF and a resistorRl = 200 Ω,\nas shown in Fig. 4.\n126 Liu, Zhao, and Zhou\n1f\n2f\n  \n1f\n2f\n1f\n2f\n1f\n2f\nLC\nC\nL\nbp\nf\nbp\nf\nbp\nbp\nC\nL\nL 1 C1\nC\nL\nf f\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFigure 2.

For example iff1 = 1.6 GHz andf2 = 3.5 GHz,\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 126, 2012 127\n1f\n2f\n1f\n2f\n(a) (b) \n1f\n2f\n1f\n2f\n(c) (d) \nXS\nf\nXS\nXS XS\nf\nf f\nc\nL\nc L\nc1\nL c L\nL 1\nc\nFigure 3.

Step 1:L1- > A1 and L2- > A2.\nAccording to Equation (1) we get the reactances of thejxs block:\nxs (f1) = 0.9946 or 0.1846; xs (f2) =−0.9369 or − 1.7318\nWe choose:xs (f1) = 0.9946; xs (f2) =−0.9369.\n3.1.2. Step 2:A1- > Oand A2- > O.\nBy using Equation (2) we get the sucepatances of thejbp block as:\nbp (f1) = 0.5105; bp (f2) = 2.0314\n128 Liu, Zhao, and Zhou\nAccording to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, both thejxs block andjbp block\ncan be realized with a parallelLC circuit thus we get the circuit of the\nimpedance transformer as shown in Fig. 5.\nThe values ofCp1 and Lp1 can be achieved by solving the following\ntwo equations:\nω1Cp1 − 1/(ω1Lp1) = 1/(xs (f1) · Z0)\nω2Cp1 − 1/(ω2Lp1) = 1/(xs (f2) · Z0)\nWe get:Cp1 = 1.7556 pF; Lp1 = 2.6345 nH.\nSimilarly we get:Cp2 = 2.0557 pF; Lp2 = 9.5136 nH.\n(a) (b) \nZ\nL\nRC\nl\nl\nll\nReal parts of Z  and Yl l\nFrequency, Hz\nFigure 4.A frequency-dependent complex load.

For each design, perfect matching is achieved at the speciﬁed\ntwo frequencies with 15 dB matching bandwiths of several hundreds\nMHzs.\nFigure 6. S11 plots of designed dual-frequency impedance\ntransformers (Case A).\n3.2. Design Examples for Case B\nThe real part of normalized admittance is below unit line within the\nfrequency range of DC-1.7 GHz, so the topology of Fig. 1(b) can be used\n130 Liu, Zhao, and Zhou\nfor dual-frequency impedance matching whenf1 and f2 are within this\nrange.\n3.2.1. Step 1:L1- > B1 and L2- > B2.\nIf we choosef1 = 0.4 GHz andf2 = 0.8 GHz the susceptances of the\njbp block can be achieved using Equation (3):\nbp (f1) =−0.5541 or 0.3290; bp (f2) = 0.2253 or − 0.7083\nWe choose bp (f1) = −0.5541 and bp (f2) = 0.2253 thus thejbp\nblock can be realized with a parallelLC circuit with the element values:\nCp = 2.6651 pF; Lp1 = 22.378 nH\n3.2.2. Step 2:B1- > Oand B2- > O.\nThen from Equation (4) we get the reactances of thejxs block at f1\nand f2:\nxs (f1) =−1.6635 andxs (f2) = 1.4548\nThe jxs block can be realized with a serial LC circuit whose\nelement values are solved from the equations:\nω1Ls − 1/(ω1Cs) =xs (f1) · Z0\nω2Ls − 1/(ω2Cs) =xs (f2) · Z0\nWe get Cs = 2.4963 pF andLs = 30.326 nH.

Big matching bandwidths are observed around the two\nfrequencies of each example.\n3.3. Design Examples for Case C\nzl(f1) is within the 1 +jx circle when f1 is below 1.35 GHz while\nzl(f2) is within 1 +jb circle whenf2 is within 1.7 ∼ 2.6 GHz,as can be\nobserved in Fig. 4(b).\nAs an example, if we have f1 = 1 GHz andf2 = 2 GHz, we\ncan list the normalized input impedances and admittances at the two\n132 Liu, Zhao, and Zhou\nfrequencies as below:\nzl (f1) = 1.5509 − 1.3206j; zl (f2) = 0.5467 − 0.1174j\nyl(f1) = 0.3738 + 0.3183j; yl(f2) = 1.7485 + 0.3754j\n3.3.1. Step 1:L2 unchanged andL1- > L′\n1.\nAs can be seen in the Smith chart of Fig. 9, the load impedances atf1\nand f2 are located atL1 and L2 which are respectively within 1 +jx\ncircle and 1 +jb circle. The ﬁrst step is to convert case C to case\nA, making the impedances at the two frequencies to be outside of the\n1 +jx circle. A shunt susceptancejbp1 should be parallel connected\nto the load for this purpose and according to (5) we have:\nbp1(f2) = 0; bp1(f1) =−1.2458 or 0.6092.\nWe choosebp1(f1) =−1.2458 so that thejbp1 block can be realized\nusing a parallel circuit ofCp1 and Lp1, which resonates onf2. We have\ntwo equations:\njω1Cp1 − j/(ω1Lp1) =jbp1(f1)/Z0 = −j0.02492\njω2Cp1 − j/(ω2Lp1) =jbp1(f2)Z0 = 0\nBy solving the simultaneous equations we get:\nCp1 = 1.3218 pF and Lp1 = 4.7907 nH\nThen we get the input impedance and admittances ofz′\nl:\nz′\nl(f1) = 0.3738 + 0.9275j; z′\nl(f2) =zl(f2)\ny′\nl(f1) = 0.3738 − 0.9275j; y′\nl(f2) =yl(f2)\nThe position ofz′\nl(f1) isL′\n1 which is on the vertical axe.z′\nl(f2) is\nstill at the former positionL2.\n3.3.2. Step 2:L′\n1- > A1 and L2- > A2.\nIn the second stepz′\nl is connected with a serial blockjxs and we get\ninput impedancezA which is on 1+jb circle at both the two frequencies.\nAccording to Equation (1) we have:\nxs(f1) =−0.4437 or 1.4113 andxs(f2) = 0.6152 or − 0.3804\nWe choose xs(f1) = −0.4437 and xs(f2) = 0 .6152 thus the\nreactance block can be realized with a serialLC circuit whose elements\nare: Ls = 4.4412 nH andCs = 3.1767 pF. By now the normalized input\nimpedances and admittances are:\nzA(f1) = 0.3738 + 0.4838j, yA(f1) = 1− 1.2944j;\nzA(f2) = 0.5479 + 0.4978j, yA(f2) = 1− 0.9106j;\nBoth zA(f1) andzA(f2) are located on the 1 +jb circle.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 126, 2012 133\n3.3.3. Step 3:A1- > Oand A2- > O.\nAs a ﬁnal step, a paralleljbp block is used to compensate the imaginary\nparts ofyA(f1) andyA(f2), we have:\nbp(f1) =−Im(yA(f1)) = 1.2944\nand bp(f2) =−Im(yA(f2)) = 0.9106\nSince bp(f1) > b p(f2) > 0, we use a three-element circuit\ncontaining Ce, Cs1 and Ls1, as shown in Fig. 10 to realize the\nsusceptance. If the serial circuit of Cs1 and Ls1 has a susceptance\nof jB′\np, we have\nbp(f1)/Z0 − ω1Ce = B′\np(f1) > 0\nbp(f2)/Z0 − ω2Ce = B′\np(f2) < 0\nSo: bp(f1)Z0\nω1\n> Ce > bp(f2)Z0\nω2\nFor convenience, we choose:\nCe =\n(bp(f1)Z0\nω1\n+ bp(f2)Z0\nω2\n)/\n2 = 2.7847 pF\nAnd then we get the values ofCs1 and Ls1 as below:\nCs1 = 0.8013 pF andLs1 = 12.645 nH\nFrom Fig. 9 we can see the matching paths for the two frequencies\nare: L1- > L′\n1- > A1- > O and L2- > A2- > O. We list in Table 3\nthree designs including the given example. They have the same circuit\ntopology as Fig. 10 but work on diﬀerent frequencies. Fig. 11 compares\nthe S11 plots of the three designs and the matching bandwidths are\nrelatively big. The biggest frequency ratio of the three designs is ﬁve.\nAs the frequency ratio (f2/f1) is bigger,Cp1 becomes smaller andLp1\nbecomes bigger, meaning the circuits are becoming unrealizable.\nFigure 9.Dual-frequency impedance matching paths for a frequency-\ndependent complex load (Case C).\n134 Liu, Zhao, and Zhou\n3.4. Discussions\nThe three types of design examples have demonstrated that the\nproposed topologies are able to achieve dual-frequency impedance\nmatching for a variety of passive loads. The possible ratio between\nthe matching frequencies can be big enough, ensuring enough matching\nbandwidths. The synthesized circuits have suitable element values that\ncan be realized without heavy nonlinearity in microwave frequency\nranges. We should note that diﬀerent dual-frequency values of the\njbp and jxs will incur diﬀerent selection of lumped circuit blocks,\nthus having eﬀect on the matching performances. Also, it can be\nunderstand that a load with smoothly-varying impedance will have\nbigger matching bandwidths than those with heavy ﬂuctuations in\nimpedances. These topologies will be suitable except the synthesized\ncircuits have elements with unrealizable values, which happens when\nthe load impedances or the frequency ratios (f2/f1) become extreme.\nl\npjB '\nComplex\n  load\nMatching\nnetwork\nZ A C LZin s\nl\ne 1\ns Z  '\nlZ\nL p\nC Rl\nL l\n1pCs1C\nLs1\nC\nFigure 10.

CONCLUSIONS\nThree types of circuit topologies are proposed for dual-frequency\nimpedance matching for arbitrary frequency-dependent complex loads\nby extending the impedance matching concepts of L-type networks.\nImpedance matching processes are described on Smith chart with\ndesign formula deduced. For realizing the needed dual-frequency\nsusceptances and reactances, diﬀerent lumped circuit blocks are\nadopted. A variety of design examples are given and compared\nvalidating the feasibility of the method. Big frequency ratios and\nbandwidths are achieved. These dual-frequency transformers use\nlimited number of lumped elements and will aﬀord much compacter\ndimension compared to other distributive alternatives.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe work was supported by NUAA Research Funding, No. NS2010105.\nIt was also supported in part by the Open Research Program of State\nKey Laboratory of Millimeter Waves under Grant K201221.\nREFERENCES\n1.
