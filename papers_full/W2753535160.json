Many distribution transformers have\nalreadyexceededhalfoftheirexpectedservicelife.This ﬁgure\nfor Western Power’s infrastructure (the electric distribution\ncompany supplying south west of Western Australia,\nAustralia) is noticeably higher than other utilities when it\ncomes to distribution transformers [1], resulting in a high\ninvestment on transformer replacement in the near future.\nTherefore, assessing and managing the lifetime of trans-\nformers is a very important task for utilities [2], especially,\nwhen considering emerging technologies in distribution\nnetworks. On the other hand, many nations have already set\nrenewable energy targets, for example in Australia ’s\nelectricity generation, a 23.5% contribution from renewables\nby2020isthetarget(MinistryfortheEnvironment [ 3].These\ntargets along with cost reduction of rooftop photovoltaic\n(PV) systems encourage investors to install PVs and\ngenerate energy from them, resulting in a PV uptake rate\nof 60% per annum [4] in recent years. Although PV systems\npresent some advantages to consumers and providers [5],\nhigh penetration of them develops some power quality\nproblems such as current and voltage unbalance [6– 11]. One\nof the disadvantage of load unbalance on a distribution\ntransformeristhe reductionofits useful lifetime [7,12,13].On\nthe other hand, the PV generation during peak time can\nreduce the load [14] and, consequently, extend the lifetime of\ndistribution transformers. Therefore, the effect of load\nunbalances on the management of lifetime should take into\naccount when assessing the lifetime of transformers. In\naddition, customer engagement is a promising approach to\nimprove theefﬁciency and economics of energydelivery.This\nengagement is usually implemented through demand\nresponse (DR) programs, such as community-based and\ndirect load control programs, resulting in postponing\ntransformer upgrade through active consumer participation.\nThe lifetime of a distribution transformer is mainly\ndetermined by insulation life [15] where itself is affected by\nthe transformer loading including magnitude and quality,\n* e-mail: a.areﬁ@murdoch.edu.au\nRenew.

In order to achieve better performance\nfor transformer investment, a correct utilisation of trans-\nformer considering loading, ambient temperature, and\nthermal characteristics is essential. To this aim, a prediction\nmodel is vital to estimate the winding hot-spot temperature\n(HST) and top-oil temperature [17]. Moreover, the detail\nmethodologies to calculate the HST is presented in The\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standard\nC57.91-1995 [18] and The International Electrotechnical\nCommission standard 60076-7 [19]. The impact of different\nlevels of PV and load unbalance on transformer lifetime is\ninvestigated in [13] over 1 year. However, for a better\nunderstanding ofﬁnancial advantage/disadvantage of PV\nand DR, it is important to analyse this effect over multi-year.\nThis is because that electric distribution planning is carried\nout over multiyear with a horizon year of 5– 10 years in\ndistribution networks [20].\nThe load proﬁle of a feeder, which is obtained based on\nindividual consumption of customers, is the main factor to\nchoose the distribution transformer and to manage its\nlifetime. Considering integration of PV and DR, this\nloading pattern will change. Therefore, different level of PV\nand DR penetration will contribute to different load proﬁle\nand consequently, to different lifetime span of a distribu-\ntion transformer. This paper presents a model to assess the\nimpact of rooftop PV and DR on the transformer insulation\nlife. A dynamic thermal model based on IEC 60076 is\nutilised for the estimation of the HST. Then, the insulation\nageing isﬁrstly investigated over a year for a distribution\ntransformer supplying a residential low voltage (LV) feeder\nas explained in [13]. This feeder and the associated load\ndata is obtained from the Perth Solar City High\nPenetration PV Trial (Perth Solar City [21]). The ambient\ntemperature data is included into the model to predict the\nlifetime span. The simulation results provided from [13]i s\nutilised to assess the equivalent of the net present value\n(NPV) of transformer lifetime under different scenarios\nconsidering the different level of PV and DR penetration.\nThe paper is organised as follows. Next section\nillustrates the proposed methodology for assessment of\ntransformer lifetime. Simulation results are presented in\nSection 3followed by relevant conclusions.\n2 Methodology\nIn order to measure age deterioration of transformer’s\ninsulation, loss of life (LOL) parameter is de ﬁned as\nbelow [13].\nLOL ¼ V EQA /C2 t; ð1Þ\nwhere LOL is loss of life of transformer in days, andVEQA is\nthe equivalent aging factor over the time period oft, which\nis formulated as:\nV EQA ¼\nXN\n1 V nDtn\nXN\n1 Dtn\n; ð2Þ\nwhere n is an index for the time intervalt, N is the total\nnumber of time intervals,Dtn is the time interval andVn is\naging acceleration factor for the time intervalDtn. The\naging acceleration factor for HST ofuh for non-thermally\nupgraded paper (reference temperature of 98°C) is deﬁned\nas follows:\nV n ¼ e\n15000\n110þ273/C0 15000\nuhþ273\nhi\n; ð3Þ\nHST model is based on IEC 60076, which is provided\nin [13]. This model uses time series data of loading per\nphase and ambient temperature toﬁnd uh and Vn at each\ntime step. The detail of this procedure and the results are\nprovided in [13], and are not repeat here.\nTo evaluate the transformer lifetime,ﬁrstly, LOL at\neach year to horizon year should be calculated based on\nequation (1). Then, the equivalent NPV of LOL over study\nperiod ofH, namely NPV\nLOL, is calculated as\nNPVLOL ¼\nXH\ny¼1\nLOLy /C2 NPVTrans\ny\n365 : ð4Þ\nThis value is actually the equivalent NPV loss of the\ninvestment during planning period.\nwhere LOLy if the LOL of yeary in days, 365 is the\nnumber of days of a year, andNPVTrans\ny is the NPV cost of\ndistribution transformer for yeary, which is obtained from\nNPVTrans\ny ¼ ConstantAnnuityValue ¼ CInv /C2 CRF\nð1 þ rÞy ; ð5Þ\nwhere CInv is the investment cost of distribution trans-\nformer, r is the interest rate, and CRF is capital recovery\nfactor, which is deﬁned for a lifetime ofY years from\nCRF ¼ rð1 þ rÞY\nð1 þ rÞY /C0 1\n: ð6Þ\n3 Simulation results\nThis section presents the evaluation of a distribution\ntransformer lifetime based on the proposed methodology\nand considering different levels of PV and DR.\n3.1 The case study\nThe considered study case is a three-phase LV (400 V line–\nline rms) feeder at Perth Solar City, as shown in\nFigure 1[13]. The installed distribution transformer is a\nthree-phase 200 kVA Dyn 22 kV/400 V, which supplies 77\nresidential consumers of the feeder. Thirty-four consumers\nhave rooftop PV systems with the average ratings of\n1.88 kW, connected through new technologies [5]. The total\ninstalled PV capacity at the time of data collection (2011–\n2012) was 64 kW representing a penetration of 32%. The\nloading proﬁle of the transformer during summer peak\nperiod is depicted inFigure 2. As seen from thisﬁgure, this\nfeeder has an unbalanced loading, e.g., the loading of phase\nB and C are much higher than the loading of phase A,\nwhich is mainly due to the non-monitored allocation of\nconsumer connections among the three phases.\n2 B. Behi et al.: Renew. Energy Environ. Sustain. 2, 27 (2017)\n3.2 Simulation of scenarios\nDifferent scenarios, considering the different level of\nPV and loading of distribution transformer, are\nmodelled and presented. It is important to note that\nunbalance condition of the feeder is taken into account\nin all scenarios to re ﬂect the actual operation\ncharacteristic of the network. Also, an average load\ngrowth of 0.08 pu/year is considered in these scenarios.\nThe considered DR program in this analysis is a\ncommunity-based DR, and is for peak shaving. The\nconsidered scenarios are:\nFig. 1. Perth Solar City high penetration feeder one line diagram.\nFig. 2. Distribution transformer peak summer loading, January 21– 27, 2011.\nB. Behi et al.: Renew.

Behi et al.: Renew. Energy Environ. Sustain. 2, 27 (2017)\n– Scenario-1: no PV and no DR;\n– Scenario-2: with PV, as described inSection 3.1, and no\nDR;\n– Scenario-3: with PV and 0.1 pu DR, which is applied from\nthe second year of the planning period. Theﬁrst year is\nfor establishing a volunteer community-based DR\nprogram in that residential area.\nThe investment cost of a typical 200 kVA distribution\ntransformer is assumed as AU$45k [22] which has a lifetime\nof 34 years. Considering an interest rate of 5%, the constant\nannuity value of this transformer is AU$2748 based on\nequations (5) and (6). The NPV of the distribution\ntransformer for each year during planning period (5 years),\nNPV\nTrans\ny , is provided inTable 1. As seen from this table,\nthe NPV is higher for later years as effect of interest rate in\nhigher as time goes on.\nTables 2– 4 present the LOL results and the equivalent\ncost for each scenario at each year over planning years\nbased on the analyses carried out in [13]. The loading of the\ntransformer in Scenario-1 increases 0.1 pu/year, realising\n8% load growth over 5 years on average. This load growth is\napplied to other two scenarios as well. As seen fromTable 2,\nthe LOL of transformer increases when its loading becomes\nhigher. For example, for the loading of 1.0 pu and 1.4 pu,\nthe corresponding LOL is 20 and 4486 days, respectively.\nThe equivalent NPV at each year is calculated using the\nsingle term of equation (4), which is\nLOL\ny /C2 NPVTrans\ny =365. As seen, by overloading the\ntransformer, the equivalent loss of NPV also becomes\nvery high. For instance, for the loading of 1.0 pu and 1.4 pu,\nthe corresponding NPV loss due to the LOL is AU$143 and\nAU$26,465, respectively. This results show that the LOL is\n5590 days during the planning period of 5 years, which\nmeans that the transformer will loss the equivalent useful\nlifetime of 15 years just during 5 years. In addition, the\nequivalent NPV loss for this transformer is about AU$33k,\nwhich is about 75% of its investment cost. Therefore, it can\nbe concluded that unbalance loading and overloading of a\ntransformer signiﬁcantly reduce its useful lifetime.\nTable 3 showsthe LOL of the transformer and the\nequivalent loss of NPV in Scenario-2, with PV and without\nDR. As seen from this table, the peak loading of the\ntransformer does not change as the injection from PV\nsystems do not coincide with the peak load period in the\nresidential feeder. However, energy production from PVs\nreducestheloading ofthetransformerintheoff-peakperiods,\nresulting in less HST of transformer oil during the peak\nperiod.Therefore,theLOL ofthetransformer inthisscenario\nis much lower that theﬁgure without PV. Also, it can be seen\nthat the LOL and the total loss of NPV during 5 years of\nplanning is 2361 days and AU$14,125, respectively, which\nare reduced by about 58% compared to Scenario-1. These\nresults show theeffectiveness of PVintegration formanaging\nthe lifetime of equipment such as transformers.\nThe evaluation of transformer LOL and the equivalent\nloss of NPV for Scenario-3, with PV and DR, is reported in\nTable 4. It is assumed that theﬁrst year of planning is for\nthe preparation of volunteer contribution of the residential\ncustomer within a community-based DR program. It is\nassumed that 0.1 pu reduction in peak load, totally from all\nconsumers, can be achieved through the DR during years\n2– 5. As seen fromTable 4, the LOL of the transformer is\njust about 10% of that in Scenario-1 and about 20% of that\nin Scenario-2. In addition, the loss of equivalent NPV\ndecreases dramatically in this scenario. The NPV loss in\nScenario-3 is about AU$3k, which is much lower that the\ncorresponding values in Scenario-2 and 3 with the NPV loss\nof AU$33k and AU$14k, as shown in Figure 3. This\nvalidates that the installation of PV and implementation of\nDR can improve the lifetime of the transformer signiﬁ-\ncantly. In Scenario-3, the equivalent lifetime loss during\nplanning period is about 1.4 years, which is much higher for\nScenarios-2 and 3 with the values of 6.5 and 15.3 years,\nrespectively, as seen fromFigure 4.\n4 Conclusions\nThe long-term evaluation of the LOL of distribution\ntransformers due to load unbalance, PV installation, and\nDR integration is presented in this paper. In addition, the\nequivalent loss of NPV of transformers is formulated and\ninvestigated. Different scenarios are discussed to show the\nindividual effect of PV and DR on the useful lifetime of the\ntransformer. The analysis results indicate that PV\nintegration and DR implementation can signi ﬁcantly\nextend the lifetime of distribution transformers. As an\nexample, the inclusion of PV and DR in the feeder of the\nconsidered study case reduces the LOL and the associated\nvalue by 90%.\nReferences\n1. D.
