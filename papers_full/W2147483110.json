    "abstract": "We have developed a new printed circuit board (PCB) technology adapted for the fabrication of ultra-flat microtransformers. The two outer layers of the PCB stack comprise the electrical windings of the inductive devices, while the inner layer is made of a micro-patterned amorphous magnetic ribbon with extremely high relative magnetic permeability (μr≈100,000). The electrical properties of the toroidal microtransformers have been studied as a function of frequency. Inductances were found to be as much as 30 μH at 1 kHz, a relatively high value compared to microtransformers of similar size. Despite a relatively high leakage flux, the voltage transformation efficiency is measured at 89%. The high performance of these devices is primarily due to the use of the high permeability magnetic core.",
