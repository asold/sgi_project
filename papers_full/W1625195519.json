    "abstract": "Analyses of acoustic wave propagation in a model power transformer are presented in the paper.The acoustic wave is induced by partial discharges that are simulated at predefined coordinates in the core and winding.Propagation of the numerical calculated acoustic wave is analyzed within the transient state.Achieved results indicate that the space and time distributions of the acoustic pressure depend on the induction position.Furthermore, a greater pressure gradient is observed in domains with higher speed of sound while the largest amplitude occurs at the vicinity of the induction position.",
