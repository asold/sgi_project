  "abstract": "A dermatologist-like automatic classification system is developed in this paper to recognize nine different classes of pigmented skin lesions (PSLs), using a separable vision transformer (SVT) technique to assist clinical experts in early skin cancer detection. In the past, researchers have developed a few systems to recognize nine classes of PSLs. However, they often require enormous computations to achieve high performance, which is burdensome to deploy on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, a new approach to designing SVT architecture is developed based on SqueezeNet and depthwise separable CNN models. The primary goal is to find a deep learning architecture with few parameters that has comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures. This paper modifies the SqueezeNet design for improved runtime performance by utilizing depthwise separable convolutions rather than simple conventional units. To develop this Assist-Dermo system, a data augmentation technique is applied to control the PSL imbalance problem. Next, a pre-processing step is integrated to select the most dominant region and then enhance the lesion patterns in a perceptual-oriented color space. Afterwards, the Assist-Dermo system is designed to improve efficacy and performance with several layers and multiple filter sizes but fewer filters and parameters. For the training and evaluation of Assist-Dermo models, a set of PSL images is collected from different online data sources such as Ph2, ISBI-2017, HAM10000, and ISIC to recognize nine classes of PSLs. On the chosen dataset, it achieves an accuracy (ACC) of 95.6%, a sensitivity (SE) of 96.7%, a specificity (SP) of 95%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95. The experimental results show that the suggested Assist-Dermo technique outperformed SOTA algorithms when recognizing nine classes of PSLs. The Assist-Dermo system performed better than other competitive systems and can support dermatologists in the diagnosis of a wide variety of PSLs through dermoscopy. The Assist-Dermo model code is freely available on GitHub for the scientific community.",
