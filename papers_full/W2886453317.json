Introduction \nThe vibration response of rectangular orthotropic plates is an interesting subject because of its \nwidespread applications in structural engineering and transport ation engineering. In bridge \nanalysis, different models have been studied and investigated by researchers for rigid highway and \nairport pavements. In most of the previous works the type of pl ates considered are isotropic \nrectangular plates which are un iform in all directions. In real ity, not all plates are isotropic. \nAnother important type of plate is the orthotropic rectangular plate, which has been used to model \nthe dynamic response of rigid concrete pavements. According to Alisjahbana and Wangsadinata, \nthe dynamic moving traffic load c an be represented by a single concentrated harmonic loading, \nmoving with a constant speed along the mid-side of the plate [1]. It was found that a dynamic load \napproach will lead to a better economical solution in compariso n to solutions obtained using the \nconventional static load approach.  \nConventional methods of rigid pavement design are using the ela stic Winkler foundation \nmodel which is obtained from the static analytical solutions of  infinite plates rest on elastic soil \nassumption. These were investigat ed by Westergaard in 1926 [2].  In this elastic Winkler \nfoundation model, the interconnections among the soil layers are neglected, leading to limitations \nin the physical model of the sub-soil system [3]. These limitations can be eliminated by modeling \nthe sub-grade soil medium by using two-parameter model, providing a shear interaction between \nindependent spring elements.  \nSeveral researchers have verified the applicability of soil medium representation by using two \n\n2917.

Gan \nand Nguyen presented the two parameter model of soil medium in the large deflection analysis of \nfunctionally graded beam [11]. \nPaliwal and Ghosh studied the stability of rectangular orthotro pic plates on a Kerr soil \nfoundation model subjected to the in-plane static stresses in t he orthogonal directions [12]. The \ndynamic lateral loads are not dis cussed in their work. The Kerr  m o d e l  i s  o n e  o f  t h e  m o s t  \nadvantageous models. However, due to the existence of an upper spring layer, no concentrated \nreactions occur. Kneifati has shown that more accurate base res ponse of the flexible plates and \nbeams subjected to a uniform load  and boundary forces was obtai ned by using the Kerr model \ncompared to the Pasternak and Winkler models [13]. In addition, the Kerr model moreover shows \ncomparable results with the continuum elastic theory. Therefore , in this paper, the authors will \nanalyze the dynamic behavior of the rigid road pavement rests o n a Kerr model and subjected to \na moving load. \nIn most researches done previously, rigid road pavements are modeled as an orthotropic plate. \nFurthermore, it is commonly resting on an elastic foundation mo del such as the Pasternak or \nWinkler models. However, according to Paliwal and Ghosh in 1994, the Winkler model is unable \nto represent the behavior of soil medium materials with a large r void ratio or stiffer clay. \nAdditionally, the Pasternak model is only better in predicting the behavior of hard soils. On the \nother hand, Kerr foundation model has more advantageous models due to no concentrated \nreactions occur due to an addition of an upper spring layer [12]. \nIn this study, the dynamic response of a rigid road pavement mo deled as a thin orthotropic \nplate rests on the Kerr model is investigated. To take into account the existence of the tie bars and \ndowels along its edges, the boundary conditions along its edges are semi rigid condition allowing \nthe rotation at the supports and the translational movement at the edges. These type of boundary \nconditions are solved by using the Modified Bolotin Method [1].  There has been no previous \nresearch using this specific method to study the dynamic respon se of the rigid road pavement \nsubjected to a moving load. In this paper, semi analytical solution is used to calculate the dynamic \ndeflection and internal forces distribution of the plate subjected to loading with constant velocity. \nThe applicability of the present method is highlighted by solving the maximum dynamic deflection \nof the system for different types of soil conditions and elastics foundation model in order to design \nbetter rigid road pavements. \n2. Governing equation \nIn this paper, a rigid pavement resting on Kerr foundation is considered. The orthotropic plate \nis semi rigid along its edges. It is considered to be of uniform thickness ℎ. The dynamic transverse \nload acting on the orthotropic plate is 𝑞(𝑥, 𝑦). Based on the work of Paliwal and Ghosh [12], the \ngoverning differential equation of the rigid pavement subjected to the lateral load is given by: \n𝐷௫\n𝜕ସ𝑤\n𝜕𝑥ସ +2 𝑏 𝜕ସ𝑤\n𝜕𝑥ଶ𝜕𝑦ସ +𝐷 ௬\n𝜕ସ𝑤\n𝜕𝑦ସ =𝑞−𝑝 ଵ, (1) \nwhere 𝐷௫ , 𝐷௬  are the flexural rigidities of the plate in the 𝑥  direction and the 𝑦  direction \nrespectively, 𝐵 is the torsional rigidity of a plate and 𝑝ଵ is foundation response. Because the Kerr \nmodel [14] consists of two axial springs (𝑘ଵ and 𝑘ଶ) and shear spring layer (𝐺௦), the deflection of \nthe plate can be given as [13]: \n𝑤(𝑥, 𝑦) =𝑤 ଵ(𝑥, 𝑦) +𝑤 ଶ(𝑥, 𝑦).

(13), \n(14) can be solved from the two auxiliary Levy’s type problems [15]. \n4. Determination of the Eigen modes of the orthotropic plate \n4.1. First auxiliary Levy problem \nThe solution of Eq. (12) for the first auxiliary problem that s atisfies the boundary conditions \ndefined in Eqs. (9), (10) can be assumed as: \n𝑊௠௡(𝑥, 𝑦) =𝑋 ௠௡(𝑥)sin ቀ𝑞𝜋\n𝑏 𝑦ቁ, (15) \nwhere 𝑋௠௡(𝑥) is the Eigen mode of the orthotropic plate in the 𝑥-direction [15]. Substituting \nEq. (15) into Eq. (12) which results in an ordinary differentia l equation for 𝑋௠௡(𝑥) in which the \nsolution of the characteristic equation can be found by assumin g 𝑋௠௡(𝑥) = 𝑒ఉ௫. By substituting \n𝑋௠௡(𝑥) = 𝑒ఉ௫ into the characteristic equation we found the sixth order characteristic equation of \n𝛽 which has two imaginary roots and two real double roots. The s olution of the first auxiliary \nproblem can be expressed as: \n𝑋௠௡(𝑥) = 𝐴ଵcos ቀ𝑝𝜋\n𝑎 𝑥ቁ +𝐴ଶsin ቀ𝑝𝜋\n𝑎 𝑥ቁ +𝐴ଷ ൬𝛽𝜋\n𝑎 𝑥 + 1൰  cosh ൬𝛽𝜋\n𝑎 𝑥൰\n     +𝐴ସ ൬𝛽𝜋\n𝑎 𝑥+1 ൰  sinh ൬𝛽𝜋\n𝑎 𝑥൰ .\n (16) \nBoundary conditions along the 𝑥-axis permit determining the 𝐴௜ coefficients from [16, 17]: \n𝑎௜௝𝐴௜ = 0,   𝑖 =𝑗 = 1 ,.., 4 ,  (17) \nwhere 𝑎௜௝ are the coefficients. \nWhen the conditions of the boundary along 𝑥=  0 and 𝑥=𝑎  in Eqs. (9), (10) are substituted \ninto Eq. (16), the characteristic determinant of Detሾ𝐀ሿ =ห 𝐚௜௝ห=  0 leads to the existence of \nnontrivial solutions. After expanding resulted in the first tra nscendental equation in terms of 𝑝  \nand 𝑞. \nThe second auxiliary Levy problem in the 𝑦-axis can be determined analogously to the above \nformulations. \n4.2. Mode numbers \nThe determinants of the first and second auxiliaries Levy probl ems, being transcendental in \nnature, have an infinite number of roots. The Mathematica softw are [18] was used to solve the \nvalues of 𝑝 and 𝑞 symbolically. By substituting the values of 𝑝 and 𝑞 into Eq. (13), the Eigen \nfrequencies of the system can be obtained. The integer parts of  𝑝 and 𝑞 represent the number of \nmode in the system. The mode shapes of the system are therefore given by: \n2917.

Numerical examples \nUsing the procedure described above, a rigid rectangular orthot ropic plate doweled of road \npavement subjected to dynamic traffic loads as shown in Fig. 1 is analyzed. The values of \nparameters which are used in the following examples are given a s: 𝑎=  5 m, 𝑏=  3.5 m,  \nℎ=  0.25 m, 𝐸௫ = 27×109 P a ,  𝐸௬ = 22.5×109 P a ,  𝜌=  2.5×103 kg/m 3, 𝜈௫ = 0.180, 𝜈௬ = 0.150, \n𝑘𝑠௫ଵ =𝑘 𝑠௫ଶ =𝑘 𝑠௬ଵ =𝑘 𝑠௬ଶ =  150 MN/m/m, 𝑘𝑟௫ଵ =𝑘 𝑟௫ଶ =𝑘 𝑟௬ଵ =𝑘 𝑟௬ଶ =  1 N·m/rad/m. \nThree types of soil condition are considered in this work: soft  soil 𝑘ଵ =𝑘 ଶ = 27.25 MN/m 3,  \n𝐺௦ =  9.52 MN/m 3; medium soil 𝑘ଵ =𝑘 ଶ =  54.4 MN/m 3, 𝐺௦ =  19.04 MN/m 3 and hard soil  \n𝑘ଵ =𝑘 ଶ = 108 MN/m 3, 𝐺௦ = 38.08 MN/m 3. These parameters are typical of the material and \nstructural properties of a highway [19]. The traffic load magnitude is 𝑃଴ = 80×103 N and 𝛼=  1/2. \nTo calculate the influence of loading velocity to the dynamic behavior of the system, 𝑣 varies from \n50 km/hr to 300 km/hr. It is also assumed that damping ratio of  the system equals 𝜁=  5 %. To \ncompare the dynamic deflections o f the orthotropic plate betwee n the Pasternak and the Kerr \nfoundation models, the following soil parameters are used: 𝐺௦ = 9.52 MN/m3; 𝑘=  27.25 MN/m3. \nAll the dynamic response of the system is computed at 𝑡=  1.5 s. This is the condition at which \nthe dynamic moving load is within the plate region. \n6.1. Influence of the foundation types \nTime history of the dynamic deflection at the center of the pla te 𝑤(𝑎2⁄ ,𝑏 2⁄) , is calculated \nand plotted for 𝑚=  1, 2, 3, …, 5 and 𝑛=  1, 2, 3, …, 4. It is found that the dynamic deflection of \nthe system is initially high, with rapid oscillations and high amplitudes for all three types of soil \nconditions studied in this paper. This observation is in agreement with Gibigaye et al. in the design \nof pavement plates rest on a soil whose inertia is considered [17].  \nFig. 2(a) shows time histories of the system under dynamic moving load for soft soil and hard \nsoil conditions of the Kerr foundation. The moving dynamic load  is set to be 𝑣=  60 km/hr and \nload frequency is 𝜔=  100 rad/s. It is observed that the rapid oscillations occur at the moment of \nfirst loading and after the oscillations become stationary for two types of soil condition. In \nFig. 2(a), it is also shown that the transient domain ends at around 𝑡=  0.06 s and does not depend \non the soil conditions. This trend was also observed in [17]. \nFig. 2(b) shows the time history of the system supported by the  Kerr foundation model and \nPasternak foundation model. To generalize the Pasternak model, the Kerr model is introduced by \nadding a layer of spring on the shearing layer to eliminate the concentrated reactions that occurs \nalong the free edges of a plate structure [13]. \n2917.

Time history of the system under dynamic moving load \nFrom Fig. 2(b), it is found that the maximum dynamic deflection  of the system supported by \nthe Kerr foundation is lower than the maximum dynamic deflection of the system on the Pasternak \nfoundation model at the mid-span if calculated with the same pa rameters [20]. This result agrees \nwith previous research done by Kneifati [13], where it was show n that the Kerr model is more \naccurate than the Pasternak models for the representation of the base response.  \n6.2. Influence of moving load on the maximum dynamic deflection \nFig. 3(a) depicts the maximum dynamic deflections of the plates  which are subjected to a \nmoving load with the harmonic load frequency is 𝜔=  100 rad/s and soil condition is set to the \nparameter values for soft and medium soil conditions of the Ker r foundation. It can be observed \nthat the speed of the dynamic load has an effect on the maximum lateral dynamic deflection. The \nmaximum dynamic deflection at the lower value of foundation sti ffness increases until about \n𝑣=  240 km/hr before decreasing. It shows that resonance conditions depend both on the speed of \ntravel and the stiffness constants of the foundation. \nFig. 3(b) illustrates the effects of load frequency on the maxi mum lateral deflection under \nmoving load for soft soil and hard soil conditions. It can be s een that load frequency has effects \non both the resonance frequency and the maximum lateral deflect ion. The resonance load \nfrequency for soft soil condition is smaller than the value of resonance load frequency for the hard \nsoil condition. \n \na) Speeds at harmonic frequency (𝜔=  100 rad/s) \n \nb) Load frequencies at moving load (𝑣=  60 km/hr) \nFig. 3.

Conclusions \nThe responses behaviors of rigid road pavements that are subjected to dynamic moving loads \nwith constant velocity have been investigated.

Based on the orthogonality properties of  t h e  E i g e n  f u n c t i o n s ,  t h e  \nsemi-analytical solution form of the dynamic displacement was o btained. In the formulation of \nthis paper, it was assumed that the supports at the boundaries of the plate are due to the tie bars \nand steel dowels, providing the plate with vertical and rotatio nal restraints. This assumption \nrepresents a realistic plate, especially for joints between the  rigid pavement plates, in which \nrotation and vertical shear deformation are found along the joints. \nFrom these results, it is concluded the dynamic response and resonance velocity is significantly \naffected by the elastic foundati on stiffness. When the rigid ro ad pavement rests on a soft soil \nfoundation, most of the pavement is affected by the loading while the resonance load frequency is \nsmall. From the obtained results, it is also concluded that the maximum dynamic deflection of the \nrigid road pavement on the Ker r model decreases significantly c ompared to that of Pasternak \nmodel. This result shows the possible economic gain of the Kerr  model when it is used for \nrepresenting the base response of the rigid road pavement. \nReferences \n[1] Alisjahbana S. W., Wangsadinata W.
