    "abstract": "In selected jurisdictions such as the USA, China, and Singapore, the integration of AI into judicial proceedings has become a tangible reality. Algorithms play a pivotal role in supporting decision-making processes during the formulation of judicial verdicts. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are also being increasingly used by judges, often in circumstances where the legal parameters surrounding their usage remain unclear. This comment delves into the realm of interdisciplinary research inquiries surrounding the application of AI in the judiciary. It begins by exploring how judges currently use ChatGPT in rendering verdicts within cases that have been publicly disclosed so far. Subsequently, it navigates through the array of questions different disciplines might pose concerning this development and discusses strategies for harmonizing these diverse perspectives in collaborative projects, potentially employing frameworks like the “orders of change” taxonomy. The article concludes with a call for increased research endeavors, particularly emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary cooperation to comprehensively address the application of AI in the judiciary.",
