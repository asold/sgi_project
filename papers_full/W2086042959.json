Benchmarking.\nSoil. Groundwater. SuRF-UK framework\n1 Introduction\nSustainable remediation comprises soil and groundwater\nrisk management actions that are selected, designed, and\noperated to maximize net environmental, social, and\neconomic benefit (SURF2009; Bardos et al.2011). This\nis conducted in a manner to ensure the protection of\nhuman health and safety that is generally built upon some\nform of risk assessment such as risk-based corrective\naction. There has been a growing interest in incorporating\nsustainability considerations into remediation decision\nmaking processes in recent years, and a number of sus-\ntainable remediation appraisal frameworks have been\ndeveloped (CL:AIRE 2010; NICOLE 2010; Holland\net al. 2011; ITRC 2011). Each of these frameworks\nWater Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1706\nDOI 10.1007/s11270-013-1706-y\nGuest Editors: R Naidu, Euan Smith, MH Wong, Megharaj\nMallavarapu, Nanthi Bolan, Albert Juhasz, and Enzo Lombi\nThis article is part of the Topical Collection onRemediation of\nSite Contamination\nJ.

Each sustainabilityappraisal method involves\na different level of analysis complexity, data require-\nments, and associated resource and operator-skill to per-\nform, while similarly aiming to aid an assessor's identifi-\ncation of the best remediation option. An ideal sustain-\nable remediation decision support tool is quick and easy\nto use, requires minimal capital or human resources, and\nsupports robust management decisions— ideally the same\nmanagement decisions as would be generated using a\nmuch more complex and precise analysis of the options.\nSustainable remediation is a relatively new concept\n(Fortuna et al.2011;B a r d o se ta l .2011). Remediation\nproject-related research has included efforts to assess the\nsustainability of remedial options at mining sites (Worrall\net al. 2009), industrially-contaminated land (Harbottle\net al.2008a, b; Bleicher & Gross2010), waste treatment,\nstorage, and disposal facilities (Petruzzi,2011) for contam-\ninated sediments (Sparrevik et al.2012), and on the sec-\nondary environmental impacts of remediation at diesel-\nimpacted (Sanscartier et al.2010) and PCB-impacted sites\n( B u s s e te ta l .2012). A number of sustainability appraisal\ndecision support tools and software are now available,\neither as proprietary software or as freely downloadable\nsoftware from a number of central government, regulatory\nauthority, and military (e.g., US Air Force) websites. Re-\nsearch on the use of qualitative approaches (Morio et al.\n2011; Schädler et al.2011), multi-criteria decision analysis\n(MCA) (Sparrevik et al. 2012), life-cycle analysis\n(Sanscartier et al.2010;B u s s e te ta l .2012), and cost-\nbenefit analysis (Environment Agency1999;H a r d i s t y\net al.,2001, 2008) for sustainable remediation appraisal\nhas been published. A narrower field of study that only\nconsiders the environmental consequences of remediation\nis also discussed in the literature, and is generally referred\nto as“green remediation” (USEPA2008). Green remedi-\nation only considers the environmental aspects and is,\nthus, not a full sustainability-based approach, since social\nand economic factors are not considered. Many govern-\nments and businesses have overarching policy objectives\nto contribute to achieving sustainable development that\ninfluence policies and practice in more specific areas, such\nas contaminated land and water management. Sustainable\nremediation frameworks help assessors apply sustainable\ndevelopment principles to the management of soil and\ngroundwater risk management.\nThis paper compares a selection of different sustain-\nability appraisal techniques for a single remediation\nproblem to test whether they lead to consistent conclu-\nsions, and to inform selection of an appropriate sus-\ntainability appraisal technique by remediation practi-\ntioners. The objective of the benchmarking exercise\nwas specifically to determine the following:\n1. Whether the use of different sustainability apprais-\nal techniques would lead to the same, or different,\nenvironmental management (remedy selection)\ndecisions\n2. Time and resources needed to undertake a sustain-\nability appraisal by each method\n3. Assessor skill requirements, and\n4. Data requirements\n2 Approach\nA benchmarking exercise was performed by using a\nsingle gasoline-release site as a test case on which differ-\nent sustainability appraisal methods were applied. The\nselected site, a retail filling station site in central England,\nhad previously been investigated, risk-assessed, and then\nremediated to the point where all unacceptable risks to\nhuman health and the environment had been mitigated,\nand the project had already achieved regulatory closure.\nPrior to considering any site-specific details, an appro-\npriate sustainability appraisal framework, sustainability\nindicators, and“rules” for scoring the benefits and im-\npacts under each sustainability indicator were selected\nand agreed by all parties to the project. In this instance,\nthe guidance issued by SuRF-UK (CL:AIRE2010; 2011)\nwas adopted. Once agreed, these common sustainability\nindicators, and scoring“rules” were used throughout the\nproject (i.e., at all three tiersof sustainability appraisal).\nIn order to approach the sustainability appraisals in\nan open and non-prejudicial manner, all the available\ninformation for the site was collated and provided to the\nassessor in stages, to reflect the data that would likely be\navailable at each tier of an appraisal in a real-life situa-\ntion. The assessor, who was an experienced land con-\ntamination professional, undertook an appraisal of the\nsustainability of remedial options in a stepwise manner,\nstarting with a simple qualitative assessment, followed\nby MCA, and then by a monetized cost-benefit assess-\nment (CBA). At tier 1, the assessor was provided with\nsite-specific details such as site characterization and risk\n1706, Page 2 of 11 Water Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1706\nassessment reports, remedial options analysis (focusing\non technical effectiveness). Details specific to the higher\ntiers of appraisal (e.g., monetary valuation of remedial\nbenefits and costs) were withheld from the assessor until\nthe appropriate appraisal tier was reached to ensure that\ndecisions that ought to be based on data typically avail-\nable during a tier 1 qualitative assessment were not\ninfluenced by access to more detailed financial data in\na CBA report.\nFollowing appraisal of the sustainability of the remedial\noptions at tier 1, a report was prepared by the assessor that\ndescribed the results and recommendations for remedia-\ntion selection. The assessor was then provided with addi-\ntional information typical of that necessary to undertake a\nmore quantitative appraisal (such as estimated CO\n2 emis-\nsions, water demand and waste generated, safety perfor-\nmance and cost for each remedial option, and the\nweighting that different stakeholders placed on the various\nsustainability criteria), and the exercise was repeated at tier\n2 using a semiquantitative MCA method. Finally, at tier 3,\nan expert environmental economist was commissioned to\nundertake a CBA of the remediation project using all the\nproject data available to the first assessor at tier 2. This\nassessment was undertaken entirely independently and\nwithout knowledge of the tiers 1 and 2 appraisals. The\nassessor was asked to select the most sustainable remedial\nsolution for the site using the recommendations presented\nin the CBA report. During the appraisals, the assessors\nkept records of the time, data, ease of appraisal, other\nobservations of the practicability of the approach, and of\nthe remedial action recommendation they would make at\nthe end of the appraisal process.\n3 Case Study Site Conceptual Model\n3.1 Location\nThe site used as a test case in this project was an\noperational petroleum filling station located in a rural\nlocation in central England. The site was surrounded\nby agricultural land to the south, a trunk road immedi-\nately to the east, and commercial properties to the north\nand west. There was no proposed change of use for the\nsite, and remedial works were required to mitigate the\nrisks to human health and the environment associated\nwith an accidental release of unleaded petrol and to\nallow continued safe use of the site for fuel storage and\ndispensing.\n3.2 Human Health Assessment\nThe site was covered in asphalt, and there were no con-\ntaminated soils exposed at the surface of the site. Assess-\nment of the risks associated with possible vapor exposure\nindicated that the site did not pose an unacceptable risk to\nhuman health in its impacted state (pre-remediation) based\non current condition and use.\n3.3 Water Resources Assessment\nThe site is directly underlain by sandstones of the Permo-\nTriassic Sherwood Sandstone Group, which comprise a\nthick sequence of fluvial and aeolian sandstones. Under\nthe UK approach, the aquifer is classed as a principal\naquifer and a regionally important groundwater resource\n(Environment Agency2006). Water quality in the Sher-\nwood Sandstone aquifer is generally good (BGS & EA,\n2007), with the exception of nitrate concentrations, which\nare generally elevated— both locally and at the regional\nscale— in the unconfined aquifer (Rivett et al.2007).\nEnvironment Agency groundwater piezometric data\nindicated that the regional groundwater flow was towards\nthe northeast (down stratigraphic dip), and this was con-\nfirmed by the local groundwater level data at the site. The\nregional hydraulic gradient in this area was about 0.0055,\nand the depth to water table in the unconfined aquifer at\nthe site was about 10 m BGL. Groundwater is abstracted\nin large volumes for potable supply at public water\nsupply boreholes located 2.5 km northeast of the site\n(licensed abstraction∼25 Ml/day), 2 km south west of\nsite (licensed abstraction∼15 Ml/day), and 5 km west of\nthe site (licensed abstraction∼20 Ml/day). The site lay\nwithin the hydraulic capture zone of the borehole abstrac-\ntion located 2.5 km north.\nThe groundwater resource (“controlled waters”)i s\nconsidered by the Environment Agency to be a recep-\ntor. Environment Agency guidance (Environment\nAgency 2006) recommends a risk-based approach to\nmanagement of existing soil and groundwater impacts.\nThe approach seeks to minimize the impacts on the\nwider aquifer resource, while allowing natural attenu-\nation processes to be considered in a limited volume of\naquifer. This is achieved by locating a theoretical com-\npliance point a short distance down-hydraulic gradient\nof the source and managing the impacted site to\nachieve relevant water quality criteria at that compli-\nance point. In this instance, a compliance point located\n50 m down-gradient of the point of release was agreed\nWater Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1706 Page 3 of 11, 1706\ndue to the high water resource value of the aquifer, the\nremedial objectives set for soil and groundwater at the\nsite to protect drinking water quality in the aquifer at\nthat compliance point, and by inference water quality\nat each of the more distant abstraction boreholes.\nA river was located to the east of the site, and flowed\nin a north-easterly direction, roughly 150 m from the site\nboundary. The river has a modified (canalized) profile,\nand survey data indicated that the water level in the river\nwas about 2 m higher than the groundwater head in the\nunderlying aquifer. Consequently, groundwater does not\ndischarge into the river in this locality, and any hydraulic\ncontinuity would be river seepage downwards into the\nunderlying aquifer.\n3.4 Remedial Options Shortlist\nA remedial options shortlist was developed for the\nproject to mitigate the effects of a release of about\n10,000 l of unleaded petrol (gasoline) into the unsatu-\nrated zone and groundwater, in order to meet water\nquality objectives at the compliance point and to pro-\ntect each of the potential receptors identified. The\nunleaded petrol released at this site did not contain\nether oxygenate compounds, and the principal constit-\nuents of concern were the BTEX compounds. Sixteen\n(16) different remedial options or combinations of\noptions were identified (Table1), including a variety\nof physical (e.g., soil–vapor extraction, air sparge,\npump-and-treat, excavation-and-disposal), biological\n(e.g., in situ/ex situ bioremediation, monitored natural\nattenuation (MNA)), and chemical techniques (e.g., in\nsitu chemical oxidation). A short-list of 16 options is\nimpracticable for normal commercial projects and a\ns c r e e n i n ge x e r c i s et or e d u c es u c hal i s tt o4o r5\npreferred options would typically be done for such\nprojects. However, for the purposes of this exercise,\nwe elected to evaluate a longer list of remedial options.\n4 Methods\n4.1 Project Boundaries and Objectives\nPrior to undertaking the appraisals, the assessor was\npresented with documented project objectives and\ngoals. These set the boundaries for the subsequent ap-\npraisal, and are presented in Table2.F u r t h e r m o r e ,t h e\nassessor was presented with a list of 16 remedial\nalternatives that were to be assessed (Table1). It was\nassumed that each of the 16 remedial options would be\nsuccessful in achieving the required risk management\nobjectives at the site (i.e., compliance with drinking\nwater standards at 50 m compliance point in aquifer,\nor prevent human exposure to potentially impacted\ngroundwater via abstraction boreholes), and the focus\nof the appraisal was on identifying any additional ben-\nefits provided over and above meeting regulatory com-\npliance, and of the environmental, social, and economic\nimpacts of undertaking remediation. No pilot or feasi-\nbility trials were undertaken to prove the likely effec-\ntiveness or durability of the 16 remedial options under\nconsideration, and the assessor was instructed to assume\nthat each would work effectively at the site (i.e., techni-\ncal feasibility was not considered as part of this sustain-\nability appraisal, since that would normally be part of a\nscreening exercise to shortlist remedial options prior to\nsustainability appraisal).\n4.2 Sustainability Appraisal Methods\nA range of tools and methods are available for under-\ntaking a sustainability appraisal, but in essence, they all\nseek to achieve the same goal to assess the relative\nenvironmental, social, and economic benefits and dis-\nbenefits (or costs) for a range of suitable options that\nmeet the project goals. The appraisal methods measure\nthe benefits and disbenefits in some way (often finan-\ncial cost, but could be any form of measurable“cur-\nrency”) and seek to identify whether the overall bene-\nfits of remediation exceed the overall disbenefits of\ndoing the work, and additionally the remedial option(s)\nthat offer the maximum benefit/cost ratio. Three sus-\ntainability appraisals techniques consistent with the\nSuRF-UK framework (CL:AIRE2010) were used in\nthis project: a simple qualitative appraisal, a semiquan-\ntitative MCA, and a fully quantitative CBA.\n4.3 Qualitative Sustainability Appraisal\nIn the first instance, the assessor used a simple qualita-\ntive approach, whereby the relative environmental, so-\ncial, and economic benefits and impacts of different\nremediation options were rated as“high,”“moderate,”\nor “low.” The assessor did not make a detailed assess-\nment of the individual indicators or factors that might\ncontribute to the performance of a remedial option under\neach of the three overarching pillars, but sought only to\n1706, Page 4 of 11 Water Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1706\nrate the broader environmental, social, and economic\nperformance of each option. Remedial options were\ncompared against a“base case” of “do nothing,” albeit\na “do nothing”approach was recognized as not being an\nacceptable solution either from a corporate or regulatory\nperspective following an evaluation of health and envi-\nronmental risks associated with the fuel release. Under\nthe “base case,”the contamination conditions were con-\nsidered to remain constant over time, and attenuation\nprocesses were assumed not to occur. In contrast, MNA\nwas assumed to be protective due to the presence of\nmonitoring that gave evidence of, and confidence in, the\nrate and effect of natural attenuation process on hydro-\ncarbon fate and persistence.\nFor ease of recording, the high/moderate/low ratings\nwere recorded in a spreadsheet, where high=3, moder-\nate=2, and low=1. The spreadsheet calculated the net\nenvironmental, net social, and net economic impacts for\neach of the 16 remedial options, and the overall balance\naccording to Eq.1.\nSR\ni ¼ Benv−IenvðÞ i þ Bsoc−IsocðÞ i þ Becon−IeconðÞ i ð1Þ\nWhere\nSRi Sustainable remediation“score” for remedial\noption i\nBx Benefit resulting from remediation, where\nx=environment, society, or economy\nI\nx Impact (disbenefit) resulting from remediation,\nwhere x=environment, society, or economy\n4.4 Semiquantitative Multi-criteria Analysis\nIn tier 2, an MCA approach was adopted using a spread-\nsheet tool. Similar to tier 1, the benefits and impacts of\nundertaking remedial action were assessed for a range of\noptions. In tier 2, the original 18 SuRF-UK indicator\ncategories\n1 (Table 3) were used, and the assessor also\nweighted the relative importance of the six different\nindicator categories listed under each pillar of sustain-\nability. Care was taken to ensure the total weights ap-\nplied across the indicators under each of the environ-\nmental, social, and economic headings were equal, such\nthat there was a balanced appraisal of the environmental,\nsocial, and economic factors.\nScores were given to each of the 18 indicators for\neach remedial option, by scoring between 1 and 9,\nusing the remediation matrix presented as Fig.1 as a\nguide to scoring. The matrix presents scores based on a\ncombination of the magnitude of an impact or benefit,\nand the duration over which the benefit/impact occurs.\nIn undertaking the tier 2 appraisal, the views of a range\nof stakeholders collected during a stakeholder engage-\nment exercise were taken into account by the assessor,\nin order that the scores (1–9) and weightings (1–5)\nrepresented a consensus (following discussion, debate,\nand negotiation) of the stakeholder panel. Weightings\nwere applied, when considered appropriate, between a\nscore of 1 (low importance placed on a specific indi-\ncator) to 5 (high importance placed on a specific indi-\ncator on the overall sustainability appraisal). When no\njustification could be made for weighting indicators\ndifferently, they were all been given an equal weigh-\nting. In this instance, the assessor sought to include\nstakeholder perspectives from the business representa-\n1 Since the time at which this appraisal was completed, SuRF-\nUK has consolidated its indicator categories down to 15 catego-\nries, as presented in CL:AIRE (2011). The coverage of those\ncategories is essentially unchanged.\nTable 1 Remedial alternatives included in sustainability appraisal\nInstitutional controls and\nbase case\nPhysical techniques Biological techniques Chemical techniques\nDo nothing Air sparge (AS) In situ bioremediation In situ chemical oxidation\nLand/water-use restrictions Soil vapor extraction (SVE) Ex situ bioremediation Water treatment at abstraction\nborehole\nPurchase/close receptor\nborehole\nDual phase vapor extraction\n(DPVE)\nMonitored natural attenuation\n(MNA)\nPump-and-treat (at source) Permeable reactive barrier (PRB)\nExcavation-and-disposal\nSVE+AS\nDPVE+MNA\nWater Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1706 Page 5 of 11, 1706\ntives of the responsible party, the HSE (environmental)\nrepresentatives of the responsible party, the environ-\nmental authority responsible for regulating the remedi-\nal works, and the local community represented by the\nlocal Parish Council. The scores for individual sustain-\nability indicators were multiplied by their respective\nweighting and were then summed in a manner similar\nto that described for the tier 1 appraisal.\nIt is important to note that, at the outset of the assess-\nment, an equal number of indicators (six) were identified\nunder each of the environmental, social, and economic\nheadlines (i.e., a total of 18 indicators across the sustain-\nability assessment) (CL:AIRE 2010). This procedure\nensured that, in the absence of individual indicator\nweighting, the three sustainability pillars were given\nequal weight (i.e., the outcome is not automatically\nbiased by a disproportionate number of indicators in a\nsingle sustainability pillar). At higher levels of assess-\nment, where stakeholder engagement and participatory\nprocesses seek to establish consensus on the relative\nweighting of the three components or their constituent\nindicators, it may be appropriate to apply weightings to\nTable 2 Project objectives, constraints, and scope of sustainability appraisal\nObjective or boundary Project-specific requirements\nLong-term business expectation for site Continued retail filling station\nBusiness constraints during remediation Minimize disruption to site operation –continue to operate as retail filling station\nMinimize safety risks to works and customers\nComply will all relevant legislation and corporate standards\nRisk-based remedial goals Comply with local regulatory requirements relating to human health and\nenvironmental risk-management\nComply with corporate HSSE Control Framework\nStakeholders Responsible party — business/corporate function\nResponsible party— HSE advisor\nEnvironmental authority regulating remedial works\nNeighbors (representative of elected Parish Council)\nTemporal boundary for analysis Duration of plume under natural attenuation conditions, or 30 years\nSpatial boundary for analysis Consider site operations, impact on neighborhood (e.g., transport routes), wider\nenvironmental effects (e.g., water abstraction or CO\n2 emissions)\nLife-cycle boundary for analysis Consider transport and use of machinery and plant for remediation, but not its\nmanufacture\nSustainability indicators SuRF-UK indicator categories (CL:AIRE 2011)\nSustainability appraisal framework SuRF-UK framework (CL:AIRE 2010)\nRemediation options evaluated 16 risk-management options presented in Table 1\nSustainability techniques Tier 1 — qualitative appraisal\nTier 2— semiquantitative multi-criteria analysis\nTier 3— quantitative cost-benefit analysis\nTable 3 SuRF-UK sustainability indicator categories (after CL:AIRE2010)\nEnvironmental Social Economic\nAir Human health and safety Direct economic costs and benefits\nSoil Ethical and equality considerations Indirect economic costs and benefits\nWater Impacts on neighborhoods or regions Induced economic costs and benefits\nEcology Community involvement and satisfaction Employment and capital gain\nNatural resources and waste generation Compliance with policy objectives and strategies Life-span and project risks\nIntrusiveness Uncertainty and evidence Flexibility\n1706, Page 6 of 11 Water Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1706\nthe individual indicators to reflect the relative importance\nof different indicators to the stakeholders.\n4.5 Fully Quantitative Cost-benefit Analysis\nAt tier 3, a CBA was commissioned by an independent\nexpert environmental economist. The economist was\nprovided with all the site-specific data available for the\nsite, and in addition collated economic data necessary to\ninput to a CBA. The WorleyParsons EcoNomics\nTM mod-\nel was used in this instance, which was developed along-\nside development of local regulatory guidance (Environ-\nment Agency1999, 2000;H a r d i s t ye ta l .2001).\nCost-benefit analysis applied monetized valuation of\nthe costs and benefits of remediation. For some criteria,\nsuch as operation and maintenance costs of a remediation\ntechnology, this data may be reasonably readily available.\nFor other indicators, particularly in the social and envi-\nronmental categories, financial data is less readily avail-\nable, and estimates and assumptions had to be made\nwhere data was not readily available. Particular effort\nwas made to collate or derive economic data, where it\nwas believed there was likely to be a significant differ-\nence between the performance of remedial options, and\nless effort was made where it was considered likely that\nthe performance of different remedial options would be\nvery similar (and the CBA would not help to differentiate\nbetween remedial options). The key issue was to docu-\nment assumptions and decisions (including the basis for\ncost estimation) in accordance with the principles set out\nby SuRF-UK (CL:AIRE2010, section 2.1, principle 6).\nThe economist provided a detailed report on the inputs,\nprocesses, and results of the CBA, which were provided\nto the assessor. The assessor then used this report, includ-\ning the assumptions where economic data was limited, to\nmake a recommendation about the best remedial options\nat the site at tier 3, as would be the case in a normal\ncommercial decision process.\n5 Results\nThe results of sustainable remediation appraisals at\neach of the three tiers are presented in Table4. For\nFig. 1 Scoring matrix ap-\nplied to tier 2 sustainability\nappraisals\nWater Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1706 Page 7 of 11, 1706\neach tier, the ranked position of remedial options is\ntabulated, where 1 is the most sustainable option iden-\ntified in that appraisal and 16 the least sustainable. In\nthe tier 3 results, the table additionally presents the\ncalculated benefit/cost ratio in parentheses. A value\ngreater than unity indicates that the (environmental,\nsocial, and economic) benefits resulting from remedi-\nation using that technique are greater, in this instance,\nthan the net costs. The final column of Table4, titled\n“Quartile,” presents the quartile position (Q1–4) of the\nremedial option in each of the three tiers. For example, a\nvalue of“132”indicates that that remedial option ranked\nin the first quartile at tier 1 (i.e., ranked 1, 2, 3, or 4), third\nquartile at tier 2 (i.e., ranked 9, 10, 11, or 12), and second\nquartile at tier 3 appraisal (i.e., ranked 5, 6, 7, or 8).\nThe tier 1 appraisal was able to differentiate between\na group of remedial options that were clearly better (in\nthe context of this specific project) than another group of\noptions. Two options, dual- phase vapor extraction\n(DPVE) and DPVE+MNA, were ranked joint first, and\na further five options, which included MNA, in situ\nbioremediation, and air sparge+SVE, were ranked\nthird/joint-fourth. The least sustainable remedial options\nincluded receptor control, treatment, and closure and\npump-and-treat.\nAt tier 2, the more detailed appraisal (using 18 indi-\ncators instead of three) was able to differentiate between\noptions ranked equally at tier 1; however, the overall\nranking of options was very similar. Fourteen of the 16\noptions evaluated fell in the same quartile of ranked\nresults in tiers 1 and 2. At tier 2, MNA was ranked\nhighest, and options incorporating DPVE and in situ\nbioremediation filled most of the top five positions.\nCost-benefit analysis at tier 3 additionally allowed\ncalculation of benefit–cost ratios for each remedial alter-\nnative. The top three ranked remedial alternatives were\nDPVE+MNA (B/C=1.18), DPVE alone (1.11), and\nMNA alone (1.09). Similar to the results from tiers 1\nand 2, the receptor-based risk management actions (e.g.,\nreceptor closure and water use restrictions) performed\npoorly in this analysis.\nOf the seven remedial options that were ranked as\nQ1 at tier 1, three were also ranked in Q1 for both the\nsubsequent tiers 2 and 3 analyses. Of the other 3\noptions, in situ bioremediation ranked Q2 at tier 3, air\nsparge-SVE ranked Q2 in tier 2, PRB ranked Q3 at tier\n3, and SVE ranked Q2 at both tiers 2 and 3. The two\noptions that ranked first and second at tier 1 (DPVE\nand DPVE+MNA) were the same two options that\nranked top in the tier 3 analysis, albeit the order was\nreversed. Of the 16 options evaluated, nine ranked in\nthe same quartile at tiers 1 and 3, and only 1 (PRB)\ndiffered by 2 quartiles (moving from Q1 to Q3 with\nmore complex analysis). Most of the remedial options\nTable 4 Results of sustainabili-\nty appraisals undertaken at tiers\n1, 2, and 3, presented as remedial\noption rank in comparison to\nother options\n*Equals sign (=) indicates reme-\ndial options rated as equal under\nthat tier of appraisal\n§ Tier 3 results show benefit/cost\nratio in parentheses\n† Quartile position of ranked result\nin tiers 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\nFor example, a value“232” indi-\ncates that remedial option ranked\nin the second quartile at tier 1, third\nquartile at tier 2, and second quar-\ntile at tier 3 appraisals\nRemedial option Tier 1\nqualitative*\nTier 2 Semi-\nquantitative*\nTier 3\n§\nquantitative\nQuartile †\nBase case (Do nothing) 14 13 14 (0.4) 444\nExcavation and disposal 9 12 13 (0.58) 334\nDPVE 1= 4= 2 (1.11) 111\nSVE 4= 8= 5 (1.05) 122\nEx situ bioremediation 8 8= 11 (0.67) 223\nPump and treat 10= 11 8 (0.8) 332\nAir sparge 10= 10 12 (0.66) 333\nMNA 4= 1 3 (1.09) 111\nIn situ bioremediation 4= 4= 6 (0.96) 112\nIn situ chemical oxidation 10= 7 7 (0.81) 322\nPermeable reactive barrier 3 3 10 (0.7) 113\nAir sparge+SVE 4= 6 4 (1.06) 121\nDPVE+MNA 1= 2 1 (1.18) 111\nWater treatment at receptor BH 10= 14 9 (0.75) 343\nClose receptor borehole 16 15 16 (0.2) 444\nRestrict water use 15 16 15 (0.25) 444\n1706, Page 8 of 11 Water Air Soil Pollut (2013) 224:1706\nthat had benefit–cost ratios greater than 1 fell in Q1 for\nall three tiers of analysis, and all remedial options that\nhad B/C ratios less than 0.667 fell in either Q4 (three\nremedial options) or Q3 (2 remedial options).\nObservations on the time, data, and assessor-skill\nrequirements and practicability of tiered sustainability\nappraisals are summarized in Table5.M o v i n gf r o mt i e r\n1 through to 3, the time and effort required to complete\nan appraisal increased. Similarly, the requirement for\nsite-specific data (particularly at tier 3) increased con-\nsiderably. In this study, the process of appraising sus-\ntainability was found to be relatively straightforward;\nthe stakeholder discussions even enjoyable. The study\nconsidered a large number of remedial options (16),\nwhich is more than would typically be evaluated on a\ncommercial project, and it is suggested that screening\nremedial options based on their likely effectiveness,\ndurability, and practicability to a given contamination\nproblem would help to ensure that sustainability ap-\npraisals are focused only on those techniques that are\nrealistic remedial options. For simple projects, such as a\nfuel retail filling station, tier 1 appraisal proved effective\nin distinguishing a limited number of remedial options\nthat were clearly better than other options. More detailed\nappraisal at tiers 2 or 3, while not considered necessary\nfor this example site, could best be used to identify\ndifferences between the short list of Q1 remedial options\nidentified at tier 1, and specifically to help quantify areas\nwhere there is considered to be a significant difference\nbetween those remedial options. Used in this way, it\nwould not be necessary to quantify an impact or benefit\nat tiers 2 or 3, where there is not considered to be a\nsignificant difference between the performance of the\nremedial options with regard to that impact or benefit.\nRather, effort should be focused on quantifying those\nimpacts and/or benefits where the performance of reme-\ndial options differs significantly and could lead to a\ndifferent conclusion regarding relative sustainability of\noptions, and therefore selection of a remedial solution.\n6 Conclusions\nSustainability considerations are increasingly important in\nsoil and groundwater risk management. New sustainable\nremediation frameworks recommend a tiered approach to\nsustainability appraisal. Thisproject compared the results\nof appraisal undertaken at tiers 1, 2, and 3 as described in\nTable 5 Observations made during sustainability appraisal benchmarking exercise\nCriteria Qualitative Semiquantitative (MCA) Quantitative (CBA)\nTime/effort* ∼0.5–1 day 1 –3 days ∼1 week\nData requirements Generic data generally adequate.

Our work suggests that for rela-\ntively simple remediation projects, a simple tier 1 sustain-\nability appraisal may be sufficient. The tier 1 appraisal\nproved effective in distinguishing a limited number of\nremedial options that were clearly better than other options.\nMore detailed appraisal at tiers 2 or 3 could best be used to\nidentify differences between the highest ranking options\nfrom a simple appraisal, and specifically to help quantify\nareas where there is considered to be a significant differ-\nence between those remedialoptions, which might influ-\nence their relative sustainability.\nRegardless of the tier of appraisal used, it was found\nthat clear project objectives and boundaries were criti-\ncal, and that clear definitions of the scope and nature of\neach sustainability indicator and clear rules or guidance\nfor how to apply weightings and scores to indicators\nwere prerequisites for a successful appraisal. Guidance\nissued more recently by CL:AIRE (2011) and ITRC\n(2011) may prove particularly helpful in this regard.\nAcknowledgments This works was funded by Shell Projects &\nTechnology, under its HSE Technology Soil and Groundwater\nR&D program.
