    "abstract": "A relatively self-contained subtask of natural language generation is sentence realization: the process of generating a grammatically correct sentence from an abstract semantic / logical representation. We propose a method where sentence realization is carried out using a simplified (context free) version of a large analysis grammar, combined with a statistical language model from the full (context sensitive) version of the same grammar. The statistical model provides a measure of the probability of syntactic substructures, derived from the analysis of a corpus with the full grammar, and is used to guide both subsequent analysis and generation.",
