One of the best known instances of this is the so-called\n‘‘ant-fishing’’ by free-ranging chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ) [1].\nNonetheless, how tool use, including that of ant-fishing in\nchimpanzees, might spread throughout a population is still an\nopen question [2]. There is some controversy as to whether the\ntransfer of these cultural practices is accomplished across\nindividuals by observational social learning or just by individual\nlearning alone [3].\nAlthough there is some disagreement about whether or not\nvarious forms of observational social learning play a role in the\ntransmission, there is a general consensus among researchers that\nthe recipient is solely responsible for the successful acquisition of\nthe skill, and that the skill’s donor does not have any active role in\nthe transmission of cultural information. In the present paper, on\nthe other hand, we present evidence which indicates the possibility\nthat free-ranging adult long-tailed macaques ( Macaca fascicularis )\nmodify their action in tool-using so as to facilitate the learning of\nthe action by their own infants. The behavior we observed was\nthat of inserting human hair or human-hair-like material between\ntheir teeth as if they were using dental floss. We compared the\npattern of the behavior in each of 7 adult females when her own\ninfant was in her proximity and when any other group member\nwas not in her proximity.\nOur study of the tool-using behavior in a group of the macaques\nin Thailand started in 2004 and continues up to the present [4].\nWhenever the material picked up by an animal is to be used as the\ntool, the animal subsequently grasps the hair taut between its two\nhands. Then, the animal inserts the taut hair between its open\njaws, and the action ends when the animal closes its jaws to engage\nthe taut hair, and pulls the hair sharply to one side by one hand\nand removes it from its mouth. Here a ‘bout’ of the tool-use is\ndefined as starting at the moment of grasping the material with the\nhands and ending at the moment of completely removing it from\nthe mouth. With this removing action, food, if present could be\ncleaned from between the teeth. Before removing the hair, the\nanimal was often observed to repeatedly rapidly close and open\n(‘‘snap’’) its jaw to engage (clamp) the taut hair between its teeth.\nWhen this occurred, the number of times the animal clamped on\nthe hair could be counted, calling it the number of snaps.\nSubsequent to the occurrence of such snapping, moreover, the\nanimal was often observed to remove the taut hair which was kept\ngrasped between the two hands, to briefly look at it at about eye\nlevel, and to reinsert it in its mouth as before. When this was\nobserved, it was defined as an occurrence of ‘‘reinsertion’’ in a\ngiven bout. ‘‘Reinsertion’’ might be repeated in that bout: after\nreinserting the hair, the animal might repeat the same action and\ntake out the hair again while grasping it with two hands. That bout\ncontinued until the animal finally pulled out the reinserted hair to\none side using one hand. In each such bout, the number of\noccurrences of reinsertion as well as the number of occurrences of\nsnapping while the hair was inserted could be counted. The length\nof each bout could also be measured by counting the number of\nframes of the video which were required to record from the onset\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 3 | e4768\nuntil the end of the bout. In addition, the number of occurrences\nof ‘‘removing of the hair from the mouth’’ was computed in each\nbout as attempts to clean the teeth. It could be counted as ‘X +1\n(X = 0, 1, 2,,,)’ in a given bout when the number of occurrences of\nreinsertion was ‘X’ in the bout.\nWhen a bout ended, perhaps on the completion of the cleaning\nof the teeth, the animal abandoned the material onto the ground\non some occasions. If this was observed, the tool-use ‘episode’\nended, during which a single bout of the activity was undertaken.\nAlternatively, however, the animal again grasped the material with\nthe two hands and began another bout with an interval of no more\nthan 1 second or so. Then, that episode continued until the animal\nfinally abandoned the stimulus. Thus, the number of ‘bouts’ in the\nepisode could be counted. Also, the number of frames of the video\nwhich were required to film from the onset of the first bout until\nthe end of the final bout was defined as the total duration of that\nepisode. If only a single bout was included in a given episode, the\nduration of the episode coincided with the duration of the bout. In\naddition, the total number of occurrences of ‘‘removing the hair\nfrom the mouth’’ in the episode was computed as an index of the\nfrequency of cleaning attempts in the episode.\nResults\nResults of the analyses are summarized in Figure 1. When the\naverage number of occurrences of reinsertion in a given bout of\nthe tool-use was computed across subjects, a likelihood-ratio test\nrevealed that the score when the infant was in the proximity of the\ntarget mother was greater than that when the infant was absent\n(x\n1\n2 = 22.201, p,0.0001). Similarly, the average number of jaw\nsnaps during each insertion of the stimulus was greater when the\ninfant was present as compared to when the infant was absent\n(x\n1\n2 = 123.6, p,0.0001). The average duration of a given bout\nwhen the infant was present was longer that that when the infant\nwas absent (x\n1\n2 = 44.51, p,0.0001). In a given bout, the number of\noccurrences of reinsertion was found to positively correlate with\nthe number of jaw snaps during each insertion (Pearson’s\ncorrelation = 0.232, n = 355, p,0.01). In a given bout, both the\nnumber of occurrences of reinsertion and the number of jaw snaps\nwere found to positively correlate with the duration of the bout\n(Pearson’s correlation = 0.770,p,0.001; 0.417, p,0.001; n = 355,\nrespectively). The average duration of a given episode, on the\nother hand, did not differ significantly when the infant was present\ncompared to when it was absent ( x\n1\n2 = 1.592, p = 0.2071) because\nthe average number of bouts in a given episode when the infant\nwas absent was greater than that when the infant was present\n(x\n1\n2 = 8.9008, p = 0.00285). The average number of occurrences of\nremoval of the hair from the teeth in a given episode did not differ\nwhen the infant was present compared to when it was absent\n(x\n1\n2 = 1.0519, p = 0.3051, mean 695%CI = 3.3860.40 when the\ninfant was present, and 3.76 60.50 when the infant was absent).\nDiscussion\nOverall, once the long-tailed macaque mothers (the target\nanimals) started to use the stimulus as a tool, they devoted a similar\nFigure 1.

However, as shown in Figure 2, the pattern of\ntheir action changed in the presence of the infants as compared\nwith that in the absence of the infants so that the stream of tool-\nusing action was punctuated by more pauses, repeated more often,\nand performed for a longer period during each bout in the\npresence of the infants.\nAs a possible factor affecting this difference, the activity of\nfeeding by the animals per se is not considered likely because the\npresent observations were undertaken at least 30 min after the end\nof the animal’s final food-taking. Rather, it seems more likely that\nthe behavioral difference is socially modulated, and influenced by\nthe presence/absence of other animals in the proximity of the\ntarget animals. In this regard, the fact should be noted that only\ntheir infants were situated within arm’s range of the target animals.\nAlthough no overt social interactions (occurrences of any facial\nexpression or communicative movement) were observed in either\nthe mothers or the infants, the influence of the presence of other\ngroup members than the infants did not appear to be a variable\naffecting this change.\nAs a possible explanation, one might assume that the mothers\nwere more distracted when the infants were present and thus took\nlonger to clean their teeth than when they were alone. However,\nthe average duration of a given tool-using episode did not increase\nsignificantly when the infants were present. More importantly, the\nmothers’ attempts to clean their teeth (as assessed by the number\nof times they removed the hair per episode) did not increase either\nwhen the infants were present. Actually, the average number of\nhair removal per episode when the infants were present was even\nsmaller than that when the infants were absent. Rather, the\nchange of the pattern of tool-using should be interpreted as a\nbehavioral modification produced by the presence itself of the\ninfants who were watching the mothers.\nConcerning human mother-infant interactions, a series of\nexperiments have revealed the fact that strikingly similar parental\nmodifications in their actions, called motionese, can help infants to\nFigure 2. Typical sequences of the action of ‘‘flossing teeth’’.(P 1 to 6) When her infant was in the proximity of an adult female (With Infant;\nP-1: Grasp the hair taut, P-2: Insert, P-3: Snap, P-4: Look at the hair, P-5: Reinsert, P-6: Pull out).

On the basis of\nobservations of 51 and 42 mothers, respectively, who were\ndemonstrating novel objects to their own infants whose ages\nranged from 6 months to 13 months, it was found that the mothers\ntended to modify their infant-directed actions in various ways.\nThey were likely to repeat the actions, to put longer pauses\nbetween actions and to exaggerate actions themselves. Such\nmagnification of the movement or ‘looming’ has been argued so\nfar to play an important role in educating the attention of human\ninfants by attracting their attention due to the occlusion of other\nsensory information [7].\nIndeed, such reasoning is confirmed by an analysis subsequently\nundertaken from an infant-like viewpoint by applying a model of\nsaliency-based visual attention to such parental action [8,9]. That\nanalysis was conducted by scientists specializing in robotics\noriginally for the purpose of investigating how such modifications\ncontribute to the infant’s understanding of the action. The results\nof their analysis showed that the model does not suppose any a\npriori knowledge about actions or objects used in the actions.\nInstead, it is able to detect and gaze at salient locations, which\nstand out from the surroundings because of the primitive visual\nfeatures, in a scene. The model thus demonstrates which low-level\naspects of parental actions are highlighted in their action\nsequences and could attract the attention of young infants, and\nalso robots. Actually, a more recent experimental study [10]\ndemonstrated infants’ preference for motionese compared to\nadult-directed actions by presenting videos of both types of\nmovement to 6- to 13-month-old infants. In the study, the\nparticipants showed evidence of such preferences even when\ndemonstrators’ faces were blurred in the videos.\nConcerning macaques, unlike humans, there is no evidence for\nimitation under controlled conditions [3]. If we define imitation as\nthe reproduction of the behavior of a model by an observer [11],\nmost empirical studies have failed to show its occurrence in social\ngroups. This could also be the case for the behavior of the\nmonkeys in the present study. In order to explain the spread of the\nbehavior in the group, therefore, we are forced to assume that\nanimals may learn new behaviors from each other through simpler\nmechanisms than imitation. A typical instance of such reasoning is\nthat its recipient’s attention may be drawn to the environment or\nan object by the presence or interest of the donor itself, even in the\nabsence of any form of intervention of social learning, for the\ntransmission of cultural information. Under such circumstances,\nagain, the modification of the action by the donor is as crucial as it\nis in the case of imitation because it profoundly affects the\nlikelihood of the recipient acquiring a new behavior, which must\nbe worked out by the recipient itself. The chance that the\nrecipient’s resulting behavior comes to resemble the donor’s due to\nenvironmental or object constraints appears to be facilitated\neffectively by such modification of the behavior as we report here,\nwhich would eventually result in the population-level phenomenon\nof that behavior.\nMethods\nThe study group was inhabiting a small city, Lopburi, 154 km\nnorth of Bangkok, Thailand. In the center of the city stands the old\nBuddhist shrine of Prang Sam Yot in an open sandy area of\napproximately 50 650 m surrounded by three 20-m-wide roads\nand a railway. The present experiment was undertaken there. The\narea is included in the home range of the study group, which\nconsisted of roughly 200 animals when the study was conducted in\nFebruary, 2008. Because tourists often visit the shrine when it is\nopen (between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.), most of the group members\nwere likely to stay there during this period. However, the study\ngroup does not spend night there, but in other woody areas at least\n1 km away from the shrine. When the research started in 2004, we\nconfirmed the tool-use in 9 adult female monkeys, who rode on the\nhead of female tourists, pulled out their hair, and used it to ‘‘floss’’\ntheir teeth [4]. Since then, the number of animals in which we\nhave confirmed similar behavior has increased up to 50, all of\nwhich are adults.\nDuring the study period, 7 females were rearing their\napproximately 1-year-old infants (3 males and 4 females). We\nchose all of these 7 females as target animals for the present study.\nThe observation was undertaken by video-recording (30 frames\nper second) the tool-use of the adults in the area of the shrine. In\norder to control the variability of the material for the tool-use, we\nused hairs from a single type of human hairpiece. To provide the\nstimuli, on each day of observation, we scattered numerous hairs\n(approximately 20 cm long) that had been dissociated from the\nhairpieces around the study area early in the morning and waited\nfor the target animals.\nThe data collection was undertaken using the focal-animal-\nsampling method. The collection starts with a focal animal, at least\n30 min after than the final food-intake of that animal. When using\nthe stimulus as a tool, the animal at first picks it up from the\nground. Whenever such behavior is observed, our video-recording\nis started. When finishing the tool-use, on the other hand, the\nanimal abandons the stimulus onto the ground, and we\noperationally defined this sequence of handling activity with the\nstimulus as the material for the teeth-flossing as an ‘episode’ of the\ntool-use.\nIn order to investigate whether the tool-using activity of a target\nanimal was affected by the presence of other group members who\nwere particularly naı¨ve to the activity, we attempted to record the\ntool-using ‘episodes’ of the animal when her infant was present in\nher proximity and when no other animals were present in her\nproximity. The criterion was solely whether her infant alone\nremained present within arm’s range as well as within the visual\nrange of the target animal throughout a given episode, both\nanimals being situated in a face-to-face position, or whether no\nanimals remained present within such range throughout another\ngiven episode. In all, we were able to record 50 episodes where just\nher infant remained in the target animal’s proximity and 50\nepisodes where no animals remained in the target animal’s\nproximity. In addition, we recorded another 21 episodes during\nthe study period. In these 21, however, animals other than the\ninfant of the target animal entered into proximity with her during\nthe tool-using activity (18 episodes), or the infant was not visually\noriented toward the target animal (3 episodes). Thus, data\nconcerning these cases were not included in further analyses.\nThe video-recording was performed using two video cameras.\nOne of the two filmed the frontal view of the target animal. The\ntool-using behavior recorded by the videos was coded online by\ntwo highly trained coders independently from one another. They\nwere not told the purpose of the present study. The detailed coding\nschema was essentially the same as that used in our previous study\n[12]. Overall interrater agreement was 97%. The other camera\nmonitored the area proximal to of the animal. When the infant of\nthe target animal was present in the proximity, the camera filmed\nits frontal view so that, by analyzing the videos recorded by this\nsecond camera and the camera monitoring the target animal, any\noccurrence of facial expressions and gestural movements could be\nrecorded in both the infant and of the target animal. The\noccurrences were assessed again by the two raters. However, none\nof them reported any occurrence of such communicative behavior\nin the target animal or in the infant during any episode.\nMonkeys’ Behavior Exaggeration\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 March 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 3 | e4768\nThe research methodology complied with protocols approved\nby the guidelines (Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory\nPrimates, Second Edition) of Primate Research Institute, Kyoto\nUniversity, Japan and the legal requirements of Thailand.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to the Ministry of Environments of Thailand Government\nfor permitting us to undertake this research.
