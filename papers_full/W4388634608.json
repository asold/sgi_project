  "abstract": "Researchers have explored various potential indicators of ASD, including changes in brain structure and activity, genetics, and immune system abnormalities, but no definitive indicator has been found yet. Therefore, this study aims to investigate ASD indicators using two types of magnetic resonance images (MRI), structural (sMRI) and functional (fMRI), and to address the issue of limited data availability. Transfer learning is a valuable technique when working with limited data, as it utilizes knowledge gained from a pre-trained model in a domain with abundant data. This study proposed the use of four vision transformers namely ConvNeXT, MobileNet, Swin, and ViT using sMRI modalities. The study also investigated the use of a 3D-CNN model with sMRI and fMRI modalities. Our experiments involved different methods of generating data and extracting slices from raw 3D sMRI and 4D fMRI scans along the axial, coronal, and sagittal brain planes. To evaluate our methods, we utilized a standard neuroimaging dataset called NYU from the ABIDE repository to classify ASD subjects from typical control subjects. The performance of our models was evaluated against several baselines including studies that implemented VGG and ResNet transfer learning models. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-slice generation with the 3D-CNN and transfer learning methods as they achieved state-of-the-art results. In particular, results from 50-middle slices from the fMRI and 3D-CNN showed a profound promise in ASD classifiability as it obtained a maximum accuracy of 0.8710 and F1-score of 0.8261 when using the mean of 4D images across the axial, coronal, and sagittal. Additionally, the use of the whole slices in fMRI except the beginnings and the ends of brain views helped to reduce irrelevant information and showed good performance of 0.8387 accuracy and 0.7727 F1-score. Lastly, the transfer learning with the ConvNeXt model achieved results higher than other transformers when using 50-middle slices sMRI along the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes.",
