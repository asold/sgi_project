Introduction \n \nSquirrel cage induction motor drives have gradually gained importance in industrial appli-\ncations because of their advantages such as reliability, free maintenance, and low cost. In addi-\ntion, the technique of vector control [1, 2] is widely employed to control induction motor dri-\nves since it has superior speed regulation performance. \nCommonly, the power supply of VCIMD comprises a 6-pulse diode bridge rectifier, an  \nL-C high pass filter, and a three phase voltage source inverter (VSI), as shown in Figure 1. \nThe drawback of the 6-pulse diod e rectifier is its injection of harmonic currents into the AC \nmains, low efficiency, and poor power factor [3]. Wh en current harmonics circulate into the \nfinite source impedance, they bring about voltage distortions at the point of common coupling \n(PCC), consequently influencing neighbouring consumers. The increasing use of induction \nmotor drives has urged the need to give clear limits for current and voltage harmonics in-\n                                         Ch. Xiao-Qiang, H. Chun-Ling, Q. Hao, L. Min                              Arch. Elect. Eng. 118 \njecting into the power grid. Hence, many standards regarding power quality have been issued, \nsuch as IEEE 519-1992 [4] and IEC 61000-3-2 [5]. \nFor alleviating utility current and utility voltage distortion, one of the most simple and \nrobust harmonic mitigation solutions is to implement multipulse AC-DC converter [3, 6]. The \nautotransformer based multipulse  AC-DC converters can further reduce magnetic ratings, as \nthe windings are interconnected and only a small portion of the total kilo-volt-ampere (kVA) \nof the load is transferred through magnetic coupling. B. Singh et al. [7-15] explored various \nconnections, such as Scott, tapped-delta, fork, hexagon, delta-polygon, and star connected \nautotransformer based multipulse rectifiers for induction motor drives load. The pulse number \nranges from 12-pulse to 30-pulse. Twelve- and 20-pulse AC-DC converters based on delta-\npolygon autotransformer for medium capacity switched mode power supply (SMPS) was pre-\nsented by Kalpana et al. [16, 17]. The proposed transformer used both multi-phase and phase-\nshifting techniques for harmonic current and magnetic ratings reduction. Oliveira [18] investi-\ngated the relationship between the output voltages on the secondary winding and the voltage \nreference from the primary winding of delta or wye autotransformer connection. Based on the \nobtained general expression, optimum operation points for 12- and 18-pulse delta or wye auto-\ntransformer based rectifiers were given. A mathematical analysis on the basis of phasor dia-\ngrams of delta or wye-connected autotransformers was discussed by Fernandes et al. [19]. The \nobtained expression simplified the process to determine turn ratios and polarities for all wind-\nings of the autotransformer. \n \n \nFig. 1. Six-pulse diode bridge rectifier supplying VSI and VCIMD \n \nWith higher number of pulses, improvements in various power quality indices can be \nachieved, but at the expense of increased magnetics complexity and additional number of \nbridge converters. Literature [20] presented 24-pulse AC-DC converter based on zigzag auto-\nwound transformer. The design of the transforme r is also modified to make it appropriate for \nretrofit applications. For more stringent power qu ality standards, rectifier systems of 30-pulse \nor higher must be used. A delta type autotransformer based 36-pulse rectifier was designed in \nreference [21], the proposed system could reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the \nAC mains current down to 3.80% and the 36-stpped utility current was very close to sinu-\nsoidal wave. Abdollahi [22-25] proposed Scott, delta/polygon, polygon, and delta/hexagon \nconnected autotransformer based 36-pulse AC-DC converters, which supplied induction motor \nVol.  65 (2016)      Thirty-six pulse rectifier scheme based on zigzag auto-connected transformer 119 \ndrives to improve power quality at the PCC. Several rectifier systems based on autotrans-\nformer with double-tap or triple-tap changer were included in references [26-29]. The multi-\ntap changer utilized DC ripples reinjection technique, which could improve power quality \ncriteria of the proposed converters without much alteration in the installations. \nThis paper analyzes a zigzag auto-wound tr ansformer based 36-pulse rectifier scheme fe-\neding a VCIMD at full length. Furthermore, the design of the proposed autotransformer is \nmodified to make it appropriate for applications , where presently a 6-pu lse rectifier is used. \nTheoretical kVA ratings of the autotransformer and interphase reactor are obtained. MATLAB \nmodel of the 36-pulse rectifier and the zigzag autotransformer is also given. Simulation results \nof four different topologies are presented and different power quality parameters such as THD \nof supply current, THD of supply voltage at P CC, distortion factor (DF), displacement factor \n(DPF), power factor (PF), and ripple factor (RF) are tabulated and compared. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 36-pulse rectifier scheme based \non zigzag autotransformer is introduced. The MATLAB simulation models are shown in Sec-\ntion 3. In Section 4, simulation results are given and performance of four different topologies \nis discussed. The conclusion is made in Section 5. \n \n \n2. The proposed 36-pulse rectifier \n \nMultipulse technique utilizes multiple 6-pulse bridge converters, where the harmonic com-\nponents generated by one converter are canceled by harmonic currents produced by other con-\nverters through proper phase shift. For harmonic reduction in the utility current, the minimum \nphase shift required should be [6]: Phase shift = 60°/Number of 6-pulse converters. \n \n \nFig. 2. Zigzag transformer based 36-pulse AC-DC converter \n                                         Ch. Xiao-Qiang, H. Chun-Ling, Q. Hao, L. Min                              Arch. Elect. Eng. 120 \nIn order to accomplish 36-pulse rectification, the required minimum phase shift among dif-\nferent groups of three-phase voltages is 10°. For the purpose of reducing the size of the propo-\nsed autotransformer, the phase sh ift angle is chosen to be ±5°, ±15°, and ±25°. Figure 2 illus-\ntrates the circuit diagram of the devised 36-pulse AC-DC converter based on zigzag autotrans-\nformer. The system consists of three phase AC voltage source, phase-shifting autotransformer, \nsix diode bridges, two interphase reactors, and induction motor drive load. \n \n \nFig. 3a. Winding configurations of zigzag autotransformer \n \n \nFig. 3b. Phasor representation of voltages in zigzag autotransformer \n \n2.1. 36-pulse zigzag autotransformer \nThe zigzag autotransformer is fed from three-phase input supply voltages ( Va, Vb, Vc), and \nit generates the aforementioned six sets of  balanced three-phase voltages, i.e. ( Va1, Vb1, Vc1), \nVol.  65 (2016)      Thirty-six pulse rectifier scheme based on zigzag auto-connected transformer 121 \n(Va2, Vb2, Vc2), (Va3, Vb3, Vc3), (Va4, Vb4, Vc4), (Va5, Vb5, Vc5), and (Va6, Vb6, Vc6) all displaced at \nan angle of required 10° for 36-pulse conversion. \nTo realize the condition of 10° phase shift, voltages ( Va1, Vb1, Vc1) and (Va2, Vb2, Vc2) are at \nan angle of +5° and -5°, respectively, with respect to AC mains voltages. Similarly, voltages \n(V\na3, Vb3, Vc3) are at +15°, voltages ( Va4, Vb4, Vc4) are at -15°, voltages ( Va5, Vb5, Vc5) are at \n+25°, and voltages ( Va6, Vb6, Vc6) are at –25°, with reference to utility voltages. The zigzag \nconnected autotransformer winding configurations for 36-pulse operation is depicted in Figure \n3a and its phasor representation of voltages is shown in Figure 3b. \nIt should also be noted that in all conver ters based on auto-wound transformers, the AC \ninput and DC output are interconnected, implying currents can flow without hindrance from \none bridge to others. Therefore, a zero sequence blocking transformer (ZSBT) is required to \nrestrain unfavourable conduction paths and ensure different diode bridges to operate indepen-\ndently. The zigzag connection is known for its ability to block inter-bridge zero sequence cur-\nrents. Thus, a ZSBT is not needed here. \nSuppose three-phase utility voltage applied to the primary windings of autotransformer as: \n  \n,120,120,0 ooo ∠=−∠=∠= scsbsa VVVVVV  (1) \n  .1503,903,303 ooo ∠=−∠=∠= scasbcsab VVVVVV  (2) \nWhere, Vs is the root mean square (RMS) value of phase voltage. \nThe six groups of required voltages for the diode bridges DB1 to DB6 are: \n  ,125,115,5 111\nooo ∠=−∠=∠= VVVVVV cba  (3) \n  ,115,125,5 222\nooo ∠=−∠=−∠= VVVVVV cba  (4) \n  ,135,105,15 333\nooo ∠=−∠=∠= VVVVVV cba  (5) \n  ,105,135,15 444\nooo ∠=−∠=−∠= VVVVVV cba  (6) \n  ,145,95,25 555\nooo ∠=−∠=∠= VVVVVV cba  (7) \n  ,95,145,25 666\nooo ∠=−∠=−∠= VVVVVV cba  (8) \nWhere, V is the RMS value of phase voltage of autotransformer windings. \nFurthermore, output voltages of phase ‘a’ of the autotransformer, as marked in Figure 3b \ncan be expressed by the following relationships: \n  ,5cos oVVs =  (9) \n  ,)( 211 bccaaba VKVVKV −−=  (10) \n  ,)( 212 bccaaba VKVVKV +−=  (11) \n  ,)()( 43213 cabccaaba VKVKKVVKV ++−−=  (12) \n                                         Ch.

However, the DC side \nvoltage of the rectifier system is about 1.5% higher than that of a 6-pulse bridge rectifier, re-\nsulting in its limited applications. \n \n2.2. Modified 36-pulse zigzag transformer for retrofit applications \nIn order to make the 36-pulse AC-DC converter appropriate for retrofit applications, the \ndesign procedure is modified here. This can be simply realized by varying the tapping posi-\ntions of the autotransformer while still have the required 10° phase shift for 36-pulse conver-\nsion. Figure 4 diagrammatizes the phasor diagram of various phase voltages to produce diffe-\nrent voltage ratios from the proposed transformer. Two winding constructions are given for \nchanging the output voltage of converter, whic h are called as asymmetric structure and sym-\nmetric structure, respectively. The asymmetric structure will be adopted here and its winding \nconstants will be calculated via the following equations: \n  \n,5cos985.0 oVVs =  (16) \n  ,187 KKK =+  (17) \n  ,9711 bccaaba VKVKVKV −−=  (18) \n  ,10712 bccaaba VKVKVKV +−=  (19) \n  ,)( 12119713 cabccaaba VKVKKVKVKV ++−−=  (20) \n  ,)( 121110714 abbccaaba VKVKKVKVKV −++−=  (21) \n  ,)( 1413119715 cabccaaba VKVKKKVKVKV +++−−=  (22) \n  ,)( 14131110716 abbccaaba VKVKKKVKVKV −+++−=  (23) \nThe values of these constants can be calculated as: \n  \n.103.0,128.0,035.0\n,153.0,094.0,078.0,016.0,561.0\n141312\n1110987\n===\n=====\nKKK\nKKKKK\n  \nWinding constants of symmetric structure can al so be calculated in a similar way. Hence, \nthe same DC link voltage as that of a 6-pulse diode bridge rectifier is achieved by just chang-\ning the transformer winding taping positions. \nVol.  65 (2016)      Thirty-six pulse rectifier scheme based on zigzag auto-connected transformer 123 \n \nFig. 4a.

Interphase reactor \nThe output voltages of the autotransformer are given to six diode bridges. A small rating \ninterphase reactor (IPR) is needed to absorb the instantaneous differences in the output vol-\ntages of the six diode bridges, all displaced by an angle of 10° am ong each other. Winding \nconfiguration of the IPR is shown in Figure 5.  Interphase reactor can ensure the independent \noperation of different rectifier bridges and 120° conduction of each diode per cycle.

Eng. 124 \nlink voltage at any instant is th e average value of output voltages of the six bridge rectifiers \nand it fluctuates with 36-pulse ripples periodically. \n \nFig. 5. Winding configuration  \nof interphase reactor \n \nThe IPR consists of a central core with six le gs and all of them are excited in the same \ndirection, preventing IPR from entering saturatio n. Air gaps in the core of the magnetics to \nchange the saturation point can be used when saturation is inevitable. \n \n2.4. Calculation of the autotransformer and IPR kVA rating \nThe magnetic rating of the proposed zigzag transformer and the interphase reactor are \ncalculated in this section. The kVA rating of the autotransformer is calculated by [6]: \n  .10005.0kVA rmsrms IV∑ ×\n×=  (24) \nWhere Vrms is the voltage across each transformer winding and Irms is the current through each \ntransformer winding. \nAssume that output load is a large inductan ce and commutation overlap is neglected. Let \nthe RMS values of the current through the windings K1 and K7 to K14 as shown in Figure 4a \nare IK1 and IK7 to IK14, respectively. Similarly, the RMS values of the voltage across the \nwindings K1 and K7 to K14 are VK1 and VK7 to VK14, respectively. The RMS values of each of \nthe winding currents and voltages can be obtained as shown in Table 1. \nThe magnetic rating of the proposed 36-pulse zigzag auto-connected transformer in terms \nof output DC voltage and current is calculated as: \n  \n,191.0191.0)]045.0137.0\n056.0137.0015.0136.0067.0268.0(2\n041.0395.0034.0395.0007.0775.0\n246.0049.0253.0049.0[35.0\n)](2\n[(35.0VA\ndcdcdcdcdc\ndcdcdcdcdcdc\ndcdcdcdcdcdc\ndcdcdcdc\n1414131312121111\n101099887711rtransforme\nPIVVI\nVIVIVI\nVIVIVI\nVIVI\nVIVIVIVI\nVIVIVIVIVI\nKKKKKKKK\nKKKKKKKKKK\n==×+\n×+×+××+\n×+×+×+\n×+×××=\n++++\n++++××=\n (25) \nVol.  65 (2016)      Thirty-six pulse rectifier scheme based on zigzag auto-connected transformer 125 \nWhere Pdc = VdcIdc is the DC side output load. \nSimilarly, the magnetic rating of the two interphase reactors is given by: \n  .039.0)039.0168.06(25.0VA dcdcdcIPR PVI =××××=  (26) \nTherefore, the magnetic rating of the 36-pulse zigzag autotransformer and IPR is appro-\nximately 19.1% and 3.9% of the DC side output load, respectively.

Results and discussion \n \nTo investigate the improvement in performance of the proposed rectifier system based on \n36-pulse zigzag connected auto transformer, a traditional 6-pulse diode bridge rectifier and  \na zigzag autotransformer based 24-pulse rectifier [20] have also been modelled and simulated. \nFor simplicity, the 6-pulse rectifier, 24-pulse rectifier, 36-pulse rectifier and 36-pulse recti-\nfier for retrofit applications are referred to as topology ‘A’, topology ‘B’, topology ‘C’ and to-\npology ‘D’, respectively. \n \n4.1. Performance of 6-pulse rectifier \nThe 6-pulse AC-DC converter’s THD of supply current at full load is 26.4%, which dete-\nriorates to 48.4% at light load (20% of full load). The PF is 0.924 under full load and 0.879 \nunder light load, respectively. The results are given in Table 2, which shows that 6-pulse rec-\ntifier injects large harmonics in to the power grid and thus can not comply with IEEE standard \n519-1992 [4]. \n \n4.2. Performance of 24-pulse rectifier \nTo improve the power quality indices, a 24-pulse AC-DC converter based on zigzag auto-\ntransformer has been designed and simulated. The THD of AC mains current at full load is \n5.04% and at light load which is 5.79%. The PF is 0.998 and 0.995, respectively, in these con-\nditions. However, DC link voltage is somewhat higher than that of a 6-pulse rectifier, thus \nmaking it unsuitable for retrofit applications. It’s rather clear that the THD of input line cur-\nrent in topology ‘B’ is within acceptable limits  for systems with shor t circuit ratio (SCR) \ngreater than twenty [4]. \n \n                                         Ch. Xiao-Qiang, H. Chun-Ling, Q. Hao, L. Min                              Arch. Elect. Eng. 128 \n4.3. Performance of the proposed 36-pulse rectifier scheme \nIn topology ‘C’, the THD of AC mains current under full load and light load as given in \nTable 2 is 3.03% and 3.58%, and the PF under these conditions is 0.998 and 0.996, respec-\ntively. But the DC side voltage V\ndc is higher compared with that of a 6-pulse rectifier. The re-\nsults are shown in Table 2. \nThe design of the proposed zigzag autotransfor mer is modified for applications where a 6-\npulse diode rectifier bridge is being used. The arrangement of the modified transformer is very \nsimilar to the proposed 36-pul se zigzag autotransformer excep t for the small differences in \nnumber of turns in the winding tapings. \nIn the proposed 36-pulse rectifier scheme for retrofit applications, the THD of input line \ncurrent under full lo ad can be observed to be 3.03% as shown in Figure 7, whereas the PF is \n0.998 as given in Table 3. Under light load condition, the THD of utility line current is 3.60% \nand the PF obtained is 0.996, as depicted in Figure 8 and Table 3, respectively. The output \nvoltage of topology ‘D’ is very similar to that of an existing 6-pulse rectifier. \n \n \n  \nFig. 7. Input line current waveform and its spectrum at full load of the proposed 36-pulse rectifier  \nfor retrofit applications \n \n \n  \nFig. 8. Input line current waveform and its spectrum at light load of the proposed 36-pulse rectifier  \nfor retrofit applications \n \nFigure 9 illustrates input phase voltage waveforms at full load and light load, respectively. \nThe utility voltage waveforms are very near sinus oidal, so the system injects little harmonics \nat the PCC. DC link current and voltage waveforms at full load and light load conditions are \nalso depicted in Figure 10. The current ripple is less than 0.01 A, and voltage ripple is less \nVol.  65 (2016)      Thirty-six pulse rectifier scheme based on zigzag auto-connected transformer 129 \nthan 2 V, reducing the size and cost of the L-C f ilter. Besides, output current and voltage have \nthirty-six pulses per cycle. Hence, the proposed converter can mitigate both AC side and DC \nside harmonic components. Figure  11 shows variation of THD of  utility current and PF with \nload perturbation on the 6-, 24-, and 36-pulse rectifiers, respectively. It is obvious that 36-pulse \nrectifier bring about considerable improvement in THD of supply current and power factor. \n \n    \n  \nFig. 9.

Variation of THD of supply current and PF with load for 6-, 24-, and 36-pulse converter \n \nTo study the effect of load variation on different power quality parameters, the load is \nvaried on the VCIMD. Table 3 shows that the THD of AC mains current is always below 4%, \n                                         Ch. Xiao-Qiang, H. Chun-Ling, Q. Hao, L. Min                              Arch. Elect. Eng. 130 \nwhich is within IEEE Standard 519-1992 limits for systems with SCR less than twenty [4]. \nThe PF is also improved to near unity under varying loads. \nIn a word, the greatly improved performance of the proposed 36-pulse rectifier system \nmakes power quality indices such as THD i, THDv, DF, DPF, and PF satisfactory for various \nload conditions. \nSimulations on a capacitive load ( C = 4700 μF, R = 15 Ω), an inductive load ( L = 40 mH, \nR = 15 Ω), and a resistive load ( R = 15 Ω) are discussed here to study the effect of load \ncharacter on various power quality indices, which is tabulated in Table 4. It can be obtained \nfrom Table 4 that when output load is capacitive, THD v is only 0.08% while THD i is 6.38%, \nmeaning that input line voltage is almost sinusoidal while input line current is still distorted. \nMoreover, output voltage V\ndc and power factor are deteriorated while ripple factor is improved \ncompared with when load is inductive or resi stive. AC mains current decreases gradually to \nonly 1.89A RMS, indicating that power backflow will happen if load is capacitive. So, the \nproposed AC-DC converter can only realize unidirectional power flow. If bidirectional power \nflow is required, all the diode bridges should  be replaced by thyristor based bridges. Per-\nformance of the converter is almost the same when load is either  inductive or resistive, except \nfor tiny difference in ripple factor. \nIt can also be obtained from simulations that the proposed 36-pulse harmonic mitigator for \nretrofit applications needs a zigzag auto-wound transformer of 2.753 kVA, two interphase \nreactors of 0.516 kVA, totaling all the required magnetics of 3.269 kVA, that is to say, only \n21.8% of the load power rating. The difference in the magnetic ratings of calculation value \n(23%) and simulation value (21.8%) can be due to  the effect of the l eakage reactance of the \nzigzag autotransformer and relatively small lo ad inductance. When calculating the magnetic \nrating theoretically, the autotransformer is consid ered to have negligible leakage reactance. \nHowever, in simulation, the autotransformer is considered to have a finite value of leakage \nreactance, leading to commutation overlap. In comparison with the total magnetics ratings of \nconventional Δ/Y/Δ 12-pulse isolated transformer (109.6 %) [6], T-connect ed 24-pulse auto-\ntransformer (39.9%) [7], fork-connected 18-pulse autotransformer (39.7%) [9], star-connected \n24-pulse autotransformer (91.0%) [13], asymmetrical polygon 20-pulse autotransformer \n(45.5%) [17], and T-connected 36-pulse autotransformer (61.9%) [22] based AC-DC conver-\nters, the total ratings of magnetics of the proposed 36-pulse rectifier scheme is much less. The \ndetailed comparison results are tabulated in Table 5. \nAlthough increasing the pulse number can bring dramatic improvement in different power \nquality indices, it will also make the autotransf ormer configuration become cumbersome and \nmore diode bridge rectifiers will be required, l eading to increased components and cost in the \noverall AC-DC converter system. \n \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nIn this paper, a zigzag connected autotransformer based 36-pulse rectifier has been de-\nsigned, constructed and simulated for a VCIMD load. The proposed scheme is capable of eli-\nVol.  65 (2016)      Thirty-six pulse rectifier scheme based on zigzag auto-connected transformer 131 \nminating up to 33 rd harmonics in the AC mains current. The proposed rectifier has the flexi-\nbility to vary the dc link voltage, simply by changing the ratio of number of turns of the \ntransformer, which makes it suitable for retrof it applications. The low equivalent kVA rating \nof the proposed zigzag auto-con nected transformer has resulted in a system of lower volume, \nweight, losses and cost compared with other types of autotransformer configuration based  \nAC-DC converters. The simulation results have shown that the THD of input current remains \nbelow 4.0% and the power factor is always above 0.995 in the wide operating range of the \nloads. The improvement in power quality indices and reduction in magnetics is considerable in \nthe proposed 36-pulse rectifier. \n \n \nAcknowledgement \nThe authors thank the anonymous referees for thei r helpful and constructive comments and suggestions. \nThe project presented in this arti cle is supported by the Science and Technology Plan Project of Gansu \nProvince (145RJZA098). \n \n \nReferences \n [1] Vas P., Sensorless Vector and Direct Torque Control.
