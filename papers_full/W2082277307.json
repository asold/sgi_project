Magnetic ﬂu-\nids have been shown to provide thermal and dielectric beneﬁts to power transformers.\nThey can improve the cooling by enhancing the ﬂuid circulation within transformer\nwindings due to a magnetically driven ﬂow, as well as they can increase the transformer\ncapacity to withstand lightning impulses, while minimizing the effect of moisture in\nA.

The beneﬁts of magnetic ﬂuids may be utilized to design\nsmaller, more efﬁcient new transformers, or to extend the life or loading capability\nof existing units. However, the side effect of utilizing magnetic ﬂuids is their heating\nunder the inﬂuence of an alternating magnetic ﬁeld, especially at high frequencies.\nThe size of this effect was studied in this article by experimental evaluation of the\nmagnetic ﬂuid speciﬁc absorption rate (SAR).\nThe heating of a magnetic ﬂuid is a result of absorbing energy from an alternating\nmagnetic ﬁeld and converting it into heat by means of relaxation losses accompany-\ning demagnetization and hysteresis losses during reversal of magnetization. Also, an\nac magnetic ﬁeld is able to induce Foucault currents in magnetic ﬂuids, like in the\nelements of a magnetic transformer core. However, this mechanism of heat release is\npractically negligible in the case of transformer oil-based magnetic ﬂuids due to their\nvery low electrical conductivity.\nFor magnetic ﬂuids with a particle radius below 40 nm, the prevailing heating mech-\nanism involves relaxation losses. There are two distinct mechanisms by which the\nmagnetization of a magnetic ﬂuid may relax after removing the applied magnetic\nﬁeld. The Brown mechanism involves rotations of the entire magnetic particle relative\nto the surrounding medium, while the Néel mechanism is due to reorientation of the\nmagnetization vector within the particle. The thermal losses corresponding to Néel\nand/or Brownian relaxation are proportional to the square of the magnetic ﬁeld ampli-\ntude [2]. If a magnetic ﬂuid contains magnetic particles with sizes of a few dozen\nnanometers or more, the magnetization exhibits a hysteresis effect which is the source\nof additional thermal losses. The dependence of hysteresis losses upon the magnetic\nﬁeld amplitude for a so-called Rayleigh loop may be well described by a third-order\npower law [3].\nThe aim of this study was a determination of the contribution of relaxation and\nhysteresis losses to the total thermal energy released during external magnetic ﬁeld\nchanges, for samples with different concentrations of magnetic grains. Also, the inﬂu-\nence of the magnetite volume concentration on the speciﬁc absorption rate,SAR\nsample\n(deﬁned as the thermal power dissipation in the unit mass of the sample) and on the\nSAR Fe (deﬁned as the thermal power dissipation divided by the mass of magnetic\ncrystal content in the sample) was investigated.\n2 Materials and Methods\nThe magnetic ﬂuid, composed of transformer oil ITO 100 and Fe3O4 particles coated\nwith oleic acid, was prepared in the Slovak Academy of Science (Košice) by the\nmethod described in [4]. A vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, home-made) was\nused to measure the magnetization curve of the magnetic ﬂuid studied. For a descrip-\ntion of the dispersion of magnetite particles, the lognormal distribution is usually used\n[5]. From the parameters of the particle size distribution function, d\n0 = 9.48 nm and\nβ = 0.407, which were extracted from the magnetization curve, the mean radius,\n⟨d⟩= 10.27 nm, and standard deviation of particle size, σ = 4.36 nm, were deter-\nmined. The particle size distribution functionf(d), obtained from VSM measurements\nis shown in Fig. 1 [6].\n123\n878 Int J Thermophys (2011) 32:876–885\nFig. 1 Lognormal distribution\nof magnetite particle diameters\ndispersed in mineral oil obtained\nfrom VSM measurements\n01 0 2 0 3 0\n0.000\n0.025\n0.050\n0.075\n0.100\nd0 = 9.48 nm\nβ = 0.407\n<d> = 10.27 nm\nσ = 4.36 nm\nf(d)\nVSM\nd,   nm\nFrom the VSM data, using the mean-spherical and the high-temperature approxima-\ntion models [7], the value of the magnetization in the saturation state was calculated as\nMS ∼= (29.19 ± 0.03) kA· m−1. The saturation magnetization allowed us to determine\nthe volume fraction of the magnetite phase from the expression,\nφ = MS\nMb\n, (1)\nwhere Mb = 446 kA· m−1 is the spontaneous magnetization of magnetite grains. In\nthe case of the magnetic liquid studied, Eq. 1 leads to a value of 6.6 %.\nThe initial magnetic ﬂuid was then diluted with transformer oil in proportions 1:2,\n1:4, and 1:8 to obtain four samples with concentrations φ1 = 6.6 % (non diluted),\nφ2 = 3.3% , φ3 = 1.65 %, andφ4 = 0.825 %. They were denoted as MF1, MF2, MF3,\nand MF4, respectively.\nThe speciﬁc heat capacity at constant pressure, Cp, for pure oil and the MF1 sam-\nple, was measured with the help of a DSCQ2000 calorimeter in the temperature range\nof 15 ◦Ct o4 5 ◦C. The values of the speciﬁc heat capacity for MF2, MF3, and MF4\nsamples were calculated according to the procedure described in [ 8]. Additionally,\nthe density and viscosity of the studied samples were measured, but the details of\nthese measurements are presented elsewhere [9]. The values of the physical parame-\nters characterizing the magnetic ﬂuid samples investigated in this study are listed in\nTable 1.\nThe experimental setup used for calorimetric measurements permitted a continuous\nrecording of the temperature inside the sample upon its heating by an external alter-\nnating magnetic ﬁeld. A glass tube containing the sample was thermally isolated by a\nlayer of material from the solenoid winding supported on a plastic sleeve. The solenoid\nwas a part of a series RLC circuit and had a length of 78 mm and a self-inductance of\n15.6 µH in air. The circuit was supplied with the sinusoidal signal with a frequency\nof 1500 kHz and an adjustable amplitude. Before heating started, the temperature of\nthe sample was set to 25\n◦C.\n123\nInt J Thermophys (2011) 32:876–885 879\nTable 1 Values of the speciﬁc heat capacity C p, volume concentration φ, density ρ, mass of magnetic\nmaterial per unit volume of ﬂuid mFe, and shear viscosity coefﬁcient ηS, determined at temperature\nT = 25 ◦C\nSample C p (J · g−1 · K−1)φ (%) ρ (g · cm−3) mFe (gFe · cm−3)η S (mPa · s)\nMF1 1.2834 ± 0.0001 6.600 ± 0.005 1.6635 ± 0.0001 0.3367 ± 0.0002 −\nMF2 1.4851 ± 0.0001 3.300 ± 0.005 1.1905 ± 0.0001 0.1683 ± 0.0002 27.1 ± 0.01\nMF3 1.6495 ± 0.0001 1.650 ± 0.005 1.0125 ± 0.0001 0.0842 ± 0.0002 14.28 ± 0.01\nMF4 1.7545 ± 0.0001 0.825 ± 0.005 0.9237 ± 0.0001 0.04209 ± 0.0002 11.50 ± 0.01\nMineral oil 1.8795 ± 0.0001 0 0.8506 ± 0.0001 0 9.61 ± 0.01\nThe temperature of the sample was controlled using a thermocouple (LT Lutron\nTM-917) with an uncertainty of 0 .1 ◦C. A detailed description of the experimental\nsetup for calorimetric measurements can be found in [10,11].\n3 Results and Discussion\nFigure 2 shows an exemplary plot of the time-dependent temperature rise of the MF2\nsample for different values of the alternating magnetic ﬁeld at a frequency of 1500 kHz.\nAs is seen from the ﬁgure for small heating times, the temperature increase is roughly\nlinear, but over longer period of heating, the heat released from the sample to its envi-\nronment begins to play a role. Thus, only the initial slope of the time–temperature\ncurve is a measure of the power release in a unit volume of the magnetic ﬂuid.\nFor single-domain superparamagnetic particles, thermal energy losses in an ac mag-\nnetic ﬁeld result from a relaxation process. A characteristic feature of this phenomenon\nis that the volumetric power dissipation is proportional to the square of the magnetic\nﬁeld amplitude, H,[ 2];\nP = πμ\n0χ0 fH 2 2π f τ\n1 + (2π f τ)2 , (2)\nFig. 2 Time–temperature\ncurves of magnetic ﬂuid sample\nMF2 for different values of ac\nmagnetic ﬁeld of frequency\nf =1500 kHz\n0 120 240 360 4 80 600 720\n25\n50\n75\nMF2    f  = 1500 kHz  \nT ,  \no\nC\nt,  s\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500 A⋅m\n-1\n123\n880 Int J Thermophys (2011) 32:876–885\nwhere χ0 is the equilibrium susceptibility of a magnetic ﬂuid,f is the frequency of the\nalternating magnetic ﬁeld, τ is the relaxation time, and μ0 = 4π × 10−7 T · m · A−1\nis the permeability of free space.\nThe relaxation process in magnetic ﬂuids proceeds according to two independent\nmechanisms. In Brownian relaxation, a whole particle rotates together with the vector\nof spontaneous magnetization. This rotation is resisted by a viscous torque due to the\nsurrounding carrier liquid and is described by a relaxation time τ\nB which depends on\nthe hydrodynamic volume Vh, shear viscosity ηS, and temperature T,\nτB = 3ηSVh\nkBT . (3)\nThe hydrodynamic volume depends on the hydrodynamic radius rh which is larger\nthan the magnetic particle radius rm by a thickness δ of a surfactant layer preventing\ncoagulation of particles. In the Néel mechanism of relaxation, the magnetic moment\nmay reverse direction within a particle by overcoming an energy barrier equal toKV m,\nwhere K is the anisotropy constant of the magnetic material andVm is the particle vol-\nume. A characteristic time associated with Néel relaxation is given by\nτN = τ0 exp\n( KV m\nkBT\n)\n(4)\nwith τ0 ≈ 10−9 s. When both mechanisms act simultaneously, the effective magnetic\nrelaxation time τeff of the magnetic ﬂuid is given by\nτeff = τNτB\nτN + τB\n. (5)\nThe mechanism with the shortest relaxation time is dominant. To achieve high heating\nrates, the Néel relaxation must not be allowed to dominate. Figure3 shows the plot of\nrelaxation time constants versus particle size for magnetite particles suspended in the\ntransformer oil. As seen from the ﬁgure, both mechanisms give equal contributions\nto magnetization for a magnetic radius of 7.6 nm which is comparable with a mean\nradius of magnetite particles in our systems. Also, the contribution of relaxation losses\nto the total power losses is far from a maximum since forf = 1500 kHz,ωτ\neff ≈ 100.\nThe relaxation losses (Brown and/or Néel) are features of small single-domain\nmagnetic particles. However, in polydispersive systems, there is a fraction of particles\nsignificantly larger than the mean size (Fig. 1) and they are responsible for hysteresis\nlosses proportional to the third power of the amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld. In order to\ncheck their contribution to the total power loss in the samples with different concentra-\ntions of magnetite particles, the experimental values of the heating rate (/Delta1T//Delta1t)t=0\nwere plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of the alternate magnetic ﬁeld amplitude. Solid\nlines show the ﬁt of the function ( H/a)n to the experimental data. The experimental\ndata used to plot the graph in Fig. 4 are listed in Table 2, and the values of the ﬁtting\nparameters a and n are listed in Table 3.\nThe value of n for each sample is larger than two which indicates the simultaneous\npresence of relaxation and hysteresis energy losses.

The values of r and h, that were obtained by ﬁtting the function given in Eq. 6\nto the experimental data of the heating rate (dT/dt)t=0, are listed in Table3.\nFrom Eq. 6, it follows that the value of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity H0,a tw h i c h\nboth components make an equal contribution to the power loss in the magnetic ﬁeld\nsample, amounts to\nH0 = h3\nr2 .

This ﬁnding is consistent with the\nresults from other studies [12].\nFig. 5 Experimental values of\n(/Delta1T//Delta1t)t=0 as a function of the\nmagnetite particles volume\nconcentration for different\nmagnetic ﬁeld amplitudes\n101\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nf = 1500 kHz 2500\n 2000\n 1500\n 1000\n 500 A⋅m\n-1\nΔT/Δt,    K⋅s\n-1\nφV,  %\n123\nInt J Thermophys (2011) 32:876–885 883\nFig. 6 Speciﬁc absorption rate\nreferenced to a unit mass of the\nsample for transformer oil-based\nMF samples MF1, MF2, MF3,\nand MF4 of different\nconcentrations of magnetite\n0 2500 5000 7500 10000\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nMF4\nMF3\nMF2\nMF1\nf = 1500 kHz\nSARsample ,  W ⋅g\n-1\nH, A⋅m\n-1\nTo estimate the amount of thermal power released in a unit mass of the sample,\nthe speciﬁc absorption rate ( SAR ) is often used, which is deﬁned by the following\nformula:\nSAR sample = Cp\n( /Delta1T\n/Delta1t\n)\nt=0\n, (8)\nwhere Cp is the speciﬁc heat of the sample. Figure 6 shows SAR sample values refer-\nenced to a unit mass of MF1, MF2, MF3, and MF4 samples. It can be seen that for\nall samples, SAR\nsample values grow monotonically with an increase of the magnetic\nﬁeld amplitude: the higher the magnetite volume fraction φ, the more pronounced is\nthe increase of SAR sample.\nOn the other hand, a speciﬁc absorption rate(SAR Fe), deﬁned as the thermal power\ndissipation divided by the mass of a magnetic crystal mFe, can be expressed as [13]\nSAR Fe = Cpρ\nmFe\n· dT\ndt . (9)\nThe SAR Fe values as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude for all samples stud-\nied are shown in Fig. 7. As seen from the ﬁgure, the samples with lower magnetite\nconcentrations φ exhibit higher SAR Fe values, as opposed to the SAR sample values\nshown in Fig.6. This can be explained by the aggregate formation in the samples with\nhigher volume concentrations of magnetite grains. Their larger volume aggregates has\nlonger Brownian relaxation times and contribute less to the thermal energy losses.\nThis conclusion is conﬁrmed by the smallest value of the magnetic ﬁeld amplitudeH0\nfor an MF1 sample.\n4 Summary\nIn this study, the heating ability of transformer oil-based magnetic ﬂuids with different\nconcentrations of magnetite particles was investigated.

For superparamagnetic particles,\nthe heating mechanism is associated with Brown and/or Néel relaxation. However,\ndue to the presence of a small amount of ferromagnetic particles in the magnetic ﬂu-\nids studied in our research, the nonlinear hysteresis losses also have to be taken into\naccount. For the lower values of the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude,H < H\n0, the relaxation\nlosses dominate whereas for the opposite case, H > H0, the magnetic hysteresis is\nthe main source of thermal energy losses. The heating process is the most effective\nfor samples with the biggest magnetite volume fraction. The speciﬁc absorption rate\nreferenced to a unit mass of the magnetic material reveals a higher value for samples\nwith a lower magnetite volume fraction. This can be explained by the formation of\naggregates in more concentrated magnetic ﬂuids.\nAcknowledgments The studies were supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education\ngrant N202 097 32/2406, and by the Project for Polish-Slovak Bilateral Cooperation No. SK-PL-0069-\n09/8158/2010.
