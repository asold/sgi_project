Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and many other social\nnetworking sites allow users to share and interact with online content and to connect with like-minded people. Its\nstrengths – rapid dissemination and amplification of content and the ability to lead informal conversations– make\nit a powerful tool to use in a professional context. This commentary explains the overall concept of social media\nand offers suggestions on usage and possible types of scientific content. It advises researchers on the potential\nbenefits and how to take a strategic approach towards building a social media presence. It also presents examples\nof effective social media use within the plant science community. Common reasons for scientists to not engage\nwith social media include the fear of appearing unprofessional, posting something wrong or being misunderstood,\nor a lack of confidence in their computer skills. With the rapid changes in academic publishing, dissemination and\nscience communication, as well as the rise of‘altmetrics’ to track online engagement with scientific content, digital\nliteracy will become an essential skill in a scientist’s tool kit.\nKeywords: Social media, Social networking, Hashtag, Blogging, Science communication\nBackground\nOver the last years social media quickly became inte-\ngrated into many aspects of our daily lives. Websites like\nFacebook, Twitter or YouTube make it easy to keep in\ntouch with family and friends, to join online conversa-\ntions and to have easy access to more funny animal vid-\neos than there are hours in the day to watch them all.\nAs such, social media still carries the stigma of a friv-\nolous time wasting activity and many scientists are re-\nluctant to engage with it due to lack of time and not\nseeing the benefits of using it in a professional context\n[1]. Other barriers include concerns around copyright\nand legal issues, different research discipline cultures or\npersonal barriers [2]. Yet social media is a powerful pro-\nfessional tool for scientists when used appropriately and\nefficiently [3,4]. This commentary explains the principles\nof social media, suggests different ways of using social\nmedia platforms in a scientific context and highlights ex-\namples of social media use in plant science. It also offers\nadvice on good practice and potential pitfalls regarding\nsensitive issues around privacy, unpublished data or in-\ntellectual property.\nWhat is social media?\nThe core principle of social media is the ability to share\ncontent with others. In order to upload content, users\nusually register and create a profile. Depending on the\nplatform and purpose, users are free to choose whether\ntheir whole profile or selected content will be publicly\naccessible or only visible to selected audiences. Types of\ncontent might be short status updates, longer text\npieces, links, images, audio or video files, publications or\nCV-related items (Table 1). Other users can then sub-\nscribe to a profile to receive regular updates about new\ncontent. This connection might automatically be mutual\nor allow selectiveness depending on the platform. For\nexample, becoming friends in Facebook or connecting in\nLinkedIn means that both users will see each other’s up-\ndates, whereas on Twitter or Google + users can decide\nwhether they want to follow a new contact back.\nContent can be indexed by using tags or hashtags (#).\nTags are key words which, when attributed to photos,\nblog posts etc., allow users to find content relevant to a\nCorrespondence: a.osterrieder@brookes.ac.uk\nDepartment of Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life\nSciences, Oxford Brookes University, Gipsy Lane, Headington, Oxford OX3\n0BP, UK\nPLANT METHODS\n© 2013 Osterrieder; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

For example, a micrograph of\nar o s eo nF l i c k rm i g h th a v et h et a g s‘rose’ and ‘microscopy’\n(Figure 1A) and will appear as search result together with\nall other photos carrying the same tag (Figure 1B). The\nterm ‘hashtag’ describes a similar concept. Adding the hash\nsymbol # in front of any word, phrase or abbreviation turns\nit into a link that when clicked displays all content\ncontaining the particular hashtag in one stream. The con-\ncept of a hashtag to initiate and collate conversations about\na certain topic is now widely used, both in popular (e.g. for\nTV shows or radio broadcasts) and academic culture [5].\nExamples of academic Twitter hashtags are #phdchat or\n#ECRchat (early career researcher chat), where researchers\nnetwork, share writing and career tips and their general\njoys and woes. The hashtag #highered displays current\nheadlines in Higher Education. Many research areas have\ntheir own hashtags, such as #plantpath or #synbio– and if\na hashtag does not exist yet, anyone can create one (check\nout #plantpathsongs). General plant science content and\ndiscussions appear under #plantscience or #plantsci and\nthe latter is also used by‘Sense about Science’ to take ques-\ntions posed to their plant science panel [6].\nWhy use social media?\nIn the simplest case, social media can provide a highly\npersonalised and relevant‘Table of Contents’ to keep up to\ndate with current research, popular science and broader is-\nsues such as science policy, funding, publishing, or personal\ncareer development. Certain social media platforms can\nalso be invaluable tools for professional networking, either\nwithin specific subject fields or across different disciplines\nand professions. Compared to purely academic sites like\nResearchGate or Academia.edu, the value of entirely open\nnetworks like Twitter or Google + cannot be understated.\nThese open platforms enable dialogue not only between\nscientists, but also offer opportunities for others to join\nthe conversation: science communicators and journalists,\nteachers, students, researchers and professionals from other\ndisciplines, as well as other interested non-experts [4].\nActively participating in social media networks allows\nscientists to disseminate research findings quickly and\neffectively as well as raise their own profile, of their research\ngroups or institution. More importantly, the interactive na-\nture of the medium can be highly beneficial for scientists by\noffering new perspectives on their own research through\nFigure 1Using tags to index social media content makes it more accessible.Example of a rose micrograph uploaded to the photo sharing\nwebsite Flickr (http://www.flickr.com).(A) Besides a meaningful title and image description, tags (= keywords) further extend the accessibility of a\nphoto. In this case, appropriate tags would be‘rose’, ‘microscope’, ‘microscopy’, ‘leaf’ or ‘plant’. (B) The search term‘rose microscopy’ displays all\nFlickr photos carrying these specific tags.\nOsterrieder Plant Methods2013, 9:26 Page 3 of 6\nhttp://www.plantmethods.com/content/9/1/26\ndialogue with peers and non-peers, and helping to establish\nnew collaborations [3]. Communicating science through so-\ncial media can also help to improve essential scholarly skills\nsuch as reflecting, writing for different audiences and devel-\noping self-discipline to write regularly [7].\nMore recently, scientific conferences have started using\nhashtags to update delegates and support networking dur-\ning the conference and even before it starts. Covering con-\nferences live on social media allows others to follow and\nparticipate in discussions online who might not have been\nable to attend - or maybe were not even aware of the con-\nference in the first place. This increases dissemination and\nreach of current research but also requires sensitivity, e.g.\nin case of unpublished data.\nMore and more funding agencies, e.g. the European\nCommission, require open access publications plus out-\nreach activities. The latter normally include scientific pub-\nlications and press releases. The use of social media in\nsuch outreach activities will get an increasingly important\nmeasure in milestone planning and reporting in such pro-\njects, especially in supranational scientific consortia.\nWhere and how to start?\nThere are many ways to engage with social media. They re-\nquire different levels of time investment but offer different\nbenefits and rewards. It all starts with the same first step\nand that is the decision which platform(s) to use and for\nwhat purpose. It is worth thinking about the following\nquestions and taking a more strategic approach towards\nsetting up a professional social media presence.\n/C15What do I want to get out of using social media:\nKeep up to date with current trends and\ndiscussions? Expand my professional network?\nDisseminate my research more widely? Engage\nnon-expert audiences? Who is my audience?\n/C15How much time can or do I want to invest and will\nthe benefits outweigh my time investment? Do I\nwant to use it daily or reserve a block of time\nregularly to read or create content? Will I need\nmore training?\n/C15How can I incorporate social media most efficiently\ninto my daily workflow? How could I connect\naccounts or automate things to save time? What\nother technologies or services can help me to\nmanage my professional online presence?\n/C15How will I be able to evaluate or track the impact of\nmy social media presence? What would my metrics\nof success be (e.g. subscriber numbers, views,\ndownloads, engagement, comments)?\nIt is important to note that not only the intended pur-\npose of use, but also the user personality can be a decid-\ning factor when choosing one platform over the other.\nOne site does not fit all and it is worth trying different\nservices before abandoning all of social media completely.\nFor example, some people feel strongly restricted by Twit-\nter’s character limits and prefer Google+, whereas others\nappreciate Twitter’s brevity. User demographics and tone of\ndiscussion can differ significantly between social media sites\nand this is useful to keep in mind when creating and post-\ning content.\nConsuming, connecting, curating and creating\nThe easiest, but also most passive way, is to purely con-\nsume content. It is entirely acceptable to just read, watch\nor listen before starting to post, and many people never\npost anything at all. Usually it is not even necessary to\nsign up for a social media service to access its content.\nRegistering an account however makes it easier to keep\ntrack of content because it opens the possibility to add\nto favourites or create lists. These features can help with\ntime management, as interesting content can so be marked\nto return to at a more convenient time. Alternatively, web\nservices like Instapaper, Pocket, Evernote, Feedly, or a\nsimple Word document (ideally stored in a Cloud service)\nfulfil the same purpose.\nSocial media users connect with others by following\ntheir updates, responding and commenting on them and\nby favouriting or amplifying content (e.g. by re-tweeting\nor re-sharing). With the exception of some websites, like\nFacebook or LinkedIn, it is generally not necessary to\nknow or contact users with public accounts before sub-\nscribing to their updates. When using social media for\nnetworking, a professional and informative profile is ne-\ncessary to be found by people with similar interests and\nto be recognised as an authentic user. The standard\nphoto should be replaced with a personal avatar, which\ncould be a portrait or a representative scientific image.\nThe profile description or short biography should con-\ntain relevant keywords such as the subject field, univer-\nsity, location, profession or other interests. Interesting\ncontacts can not only be found via the search function,\nbut also in contact lists of others, as contributors to rele-\nvant topics or on curated public subject lists [8,9]. Adding\nlinks to social media accounts on presentation slides or\nposters allows others to connect and keep updated in an\ninformal way. When participating in online discussions it\nis essential to remember that the internet is a public space\nwhere comments are cached, shared and may be spread\nbeyond your control. A good rule of thumb is to only put\nthings online that you would be happy for the rest of the\nworld to see, even if content is seemingly posted to a re-\nstricted number of people (screenshots can travel surpris-\ningly far). Respect the social rules of the‘netiquette, the\nnetwork etiquette, and be aware of copyright and libel\nlaws (see also advice in Table 1).

Table 2 shows\na small selection of examples, highlighting the wide range\nof possibilities to use social media for plant science com-\nmunication. It is important to be realistic about one’s\nexisting skills and the time investment required. Writing a\nblog entry might take a few hours but will get easier with\npractice; uploading micrographs or short videos might just\nbe a quick additional step after curating existing data;\ntweeting an interesting paper takes only a moment. A lar-\nger or complex social media project however might benefit\nfrom working together with other scientists, professional\ndesigners, programmers or communicators.\nChallenges\nThe power of social media lies in its interactivity and its\nstrength to amplify the reach of content. At the same\ntime this has the potential to quickly turn into a pitfall.\nIt is therefore essential to be aware of basic rules for using\nsocial media. Some of these are included in the rules of\n‘netiquette’ and general professional conducts of behaviour.\nOthers depend on the type of content posted and revolve\naround copyright, intellectual property or confidentiality\nissues.\nWith the changes in traditional academic publishing, a\nmajor development and yet still a considerable challenge\nis to identify the impact of scientific content beyond\nestablished measures such as citation counts or journal\nimpact factors. ‘Altmetrics’ aim to capture the online ac-\ntivity around a scientific publication by tracking metrics\nsuch as downloads, number of readers or amplification\nand discussion in social networks [10,11]. Researchers can\nassess their online impact by using professional applica-\ntions such as Altmetric Explorer [12], Impact Story [13] or\na range of other tools [14]. A quick way to get a feel for the\nonline reach of a scientific publication is to pay attention\nto the article’s altmetrics which are increasingly displayed\non journal websites, or to track the reach of a link or\nhashtag using special social search engines like Topsy [15].\nConclusion\nEven though specific platforms will change in the future,\nthe concept of social media is likely to stay. As such it will\nbecome more and more important to engage with social\nmedia and become‘digitally literate’ rather than avoiding\nor resisting its use at all. There are still many grey areas\nsurrounding social media in society. Unexpected new uses\nof the medium emerge constantly and carry various op-\nportunities and challenges with them, one good example\nbeing citizen live-reporting during recent disasters. While\nwe are starting to establish rules of good practice for some\nscenarios, society is still trying to evaluate the full impact\nof others. Understanding social media, and having the\nknowledge and confidence to use it appropriately and ef-\nfectively for professional purposes will become essential\nskills to be included in a scientist’ss k i l l st o o lk i t .\nCompeting interests\nThe author declares that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ information\nAO (@AnneOsterrieder) holds a Research and Science Communication\nFellowship at Oxford Brookes University, which allows her to combine her\nresearch in plant cell biology with her passion for facilitating science\ncommunication and public engagement.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Dr Alun Salt for critical reading of the manuscript.
