Author Bikesh\nTwanabasu was employe d by Hexa Internationa l\nmapping (DSM), involves the creation and population of spatial soil information systems\nusing field and laboratory observational methods coupled with spatial and non-spatial soil\ninference systems [2–5]. Field sampling is used to determine the spatial distribution of soil\nproperties, and these surface grids point data are then interpolated to estimate soil properties\nin areas not sampled [6]. In contrast, existing conventional soil survey methods are relatively\nslow and expensive; therein, soil databases are neither exhaustive enough nor precise enough\nto promote an extensive and credible use of soil information within the spatial data [7].\nSeveral statistical models can be used in DSM to develop a relationship between soil proper-\nties and environmental variables (often related to soil forming factors such as terrain attributes\n—altitude, aspect, and slope) rather than from soil observations alone [8], and McBratney\net al. [9] thorough reviewed the various models used. Soil nutrients are one of the most impor-\ntant properties governing soil quality, and hence have a significant impact on the variability of\nsoil productivity and crop production. The spatial variability of soil properties can be mapped\nusing an interpolation technique [10]. Many spatial interpolation methods have been devel-\noped and several terms have been used to distinguish them, including “deterministic” and\n“stochastic” [11]. Deterministic interpolation methods such as thiessen, density estimation,\ninverse-distance-weighted, and splines, provide no assessment of errors, whereas stochastic\ninterpolation and kriging methods do provide prediction error assessments.\nKriging is a geostatic interpolation technique that has proven sufficiently robust for estimat-\ning values at non-sampled locations based on sampled data. It provides the best linear unbi-\nased estimates and information on the distribution of the estimation error and shows strong\nstatistical advantages [12]. The use of the geostatistical interpolation technique also reduces\nthe costs of field sampling and laboratory analysis, provided that a given set of soil samples suf-\nficiently represents the study area [13]. However, the reliability of spatial variability maps\ndepends on the adequate sampling data and the accuracy of the spatial interpolation [14].\nThere is a significantly increased trend in the use of DSM mainly due to recent advances in\ntechnology related to quantitative methodologies and geographic information systems. For\nexample, spatial variability of organic matter (OM), pH, and potassium (K) were mapped\nusing kriging by Lopez-Granados et al. [15] in a 40 ha field located in southern Spain. Santos\nFrance ´ s et al. used the kriging interpolation method for the production of spatial distribution\nof the heavy metal contents in the soils of northern Spain [16] and northern Peru [17], respec-\ntively. Balkovič et al. [18] reported that the DSM model represents a complete alternative to\nclassical soil mapping at very fine scales on erosion affecting 37 ha of arable land in Slovakia,\neven when soil profile descriptions were collected merely by field estimation methods. In\nnorthwestern Australia, a DSM soil carbon map at the farm scale was developed from a total of\n127 soil sampling locations in an area of 2300 ha [19]. Similarly, Zhang et al. [20] produced\nspatial variability maps of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and K in winter wheat and summer\nmaize in northeast China. Recently Zhu et al. [21] used an alternative DSM method, individual\npredictive soil mapping (iPSM), to map OM content in the topsoil layer of an area of 6000 ha\nin China and observed that iPSM is an effective alternative when existing soil samples are lim-\nited in their ability to fully represent the entire study area.\nDespite the successful application of DSM in regions around the world, no single study has\nexamined the use of DSM to represent soil nutrient variability in any part of Nepal. The com-\nmonly practiced soil fertility assessment is based on a random soil sampling protocol to obtain\nan average fertility value for a farmer’s field [22]. It ignores spatial variability, or those soil test-\ning results that do not provide randomness of variations from one place to another. Conse-\nquently, some parts of the field may receive surplus fertilizer while others may lack nutrients\nand experience the undesired levels of productivity. The objective of this research was to deter-\nmine and map the spatial distribution of variability in soil chemical properties of agricultural\nDigital soil mapping in the Bara district of Nepal using kriging tool in ArcGIS\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02063 50 October 26, 2018 2 / 20\nPvt.

The country’s economy\nrelies heavily on agriculture and any breakthrough in soil mapping would immensely benefit\nfarmers. Information on spatial variability of soil nutrients is also essential for sustainable\nmanagement of soil fertility.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy area\nNepal is located in the south of Asia bordering neighbors of India and China and covers an\narea of approximately 147,181 km\n2\n. It has been divided broadly into three geographic regions:\nHimalayan, Hilly, and Terai. The study was conducted in the southern part of the Bara district,\nwhich falls under Terai region, and included the 23 Village Development Committees (VDCs)\nand covers 12,516 ha of land as shown in Fig 1. The topographic variation of the study area\nranges from 80 to 95 m.\nThere are four seasons in Nepal: pre-monsoon (March to May), monsoon (June to Septem-\nber), post-monsoon (October to November) and winter (December to February). Monsoons\nare the Nepal’s main source of precipitation, accounting for 85% of the country’s total annual\nrainfall of 1800 mm, with the remaining 15% occurring in winter [23–24]. During a monsoon,\nall of the rivers are in spate, with bank-full discharges that cause flooding and inundation in\nseveral parts of the Terai region [25]. The study area becomes hottest (37 to 42˚C) during the\nmonsoon months compared to the country’s average temperature (28˚C) due to seasonal\nchanges and low altitude.\nRice (Oryza sativa L.) is the principal staple food of Nepal, accounting for about 67% of\ntotal cereal consumption. Most of the food crops for the entire country are grown in the Terai\nregion, the granary of Nepal. The terai is generally made up of flat terrain with a hot, humid\nclimate. About 80% of the land in this area is occupied by farmlands. Rice -wheat (Triticum\naestivum L.)-fallow is the dominant cropping system in the study area followed by rice-wheat/\nlentils (Lens culinaris)-fallow, rice-wheat-maize (Zea mays L.), and sugarcane (Sacharum\nofficinarum).\nThe soil association of the study area is developed by the changing river morphology. The\nsoils have predominantly evolved from alluvial deposits and are dominated by sandy loam and\nsilty clay, although clay loam and loamy sand are also present at considerable levels. It was\nobserved that the majority of the area is occupied by land system unit 2b (deep alluvium: <0.5\ndegree slope, flat, imperfect drainage, sandy loam to silty clay, Aeric, Haplaquepts, Typic, and\nFluventic) followed by 2a (deep alluvium: < 0.5 degree slope, depression, poor drainage, loam\nto silty clay, Aeric, Haplaquepts, and Typic), 3a (deep alluvium: < 1 degree slope, gently undu-\nlating, moderate drainage, sandy loam to silty clay, Haplaquepts, Typic, Ustocrepts, and Dys-\ntrochrepts), and 2c (stratified alluvium: < 1 degree slope, micro-relief, variable drainage, low\nareas subject to flooding, sandy loam to silty clay, Typic, and Fluventic).\nSoil sampling and analysis\nSurface soil samples (0 to 15 cm depth) were collected during May 2013 using a soil auger in\nthe study area. Soil sampling locations were selected to best represent the land use condition in\neach VDC while considering terrain attributes and drainage conditions. A few VDCs such as\nParsurampur and Golganj had only one soil sampling location. By following one soil sample\nper location, a total of 109 soil samples were collected from the study area, and the details of\nsoil sampling locations are given in Fig 1. A global positioning system receiver with 1 m preci-\nsion was used to record the longitude and latitude of soil sampling locations. No specific\nDigital soil mapping in the Bara district of Nepal using kriging tool in ArcGIS\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02063 50 October 26, 2018 3 / 20\npermissions were required for soil sampling in these locations and the field studies did not\ninvolve endangered or protected species.\nThe collected soil samples were air-dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve for chemical\nanalysis conducted at the Regional Soil Testing Laboratory, Kaski district of Nepal.

For all measured\nsoil characteristics, the visual method (histogram, boxplot and normal plot) and values of skew\nand kurtosis were used and no figures were included for the univariate test of normality in\nSAS software [33] prior to ordinary kriging.\nThis study focused on ordinary kriging (the general name for kriging), a linear geostatistical\ninterpolation technique. Kriging estimates were calculated as weighted sums of the adjacent\nsampled concentrations. It is an improvement over inverse distance weighting (another geos-\ntatistical tool) interpolation because prediction estimates in kriging tend to be less biased and\nare accompanied by prediction standard errors [34]. Details of the kriging formula and calcu-\nlation are given in Yao et al. [14]. The main application of geostatistics in soil science has been\nthe estimation and mapping of soil attributes out of sampled areas [35].\nRegardless of data distribution, kriging can provide the best-unbiased predictor of values at\nunsampled points, though data that have closer to a normal distribution can provide the best\nestimates of probability maps [36]. Therefore, it was necessary to normalize the dataset prior\nto geostatistical analysis because of high skew (Table 2) and the presence of outliers. Since the\ncoefficient of skew was greater than one (except for pH and P\n2\nO\n5\n), the logarithmic transforma-\ntion was applied for a kriging analysis (lognormal kriging, hereafter referred to as kriging) to\nstabilize the variance [35]. The logarithmic transformation resulted in smaller skew and kurto-\nsis for OM, N, K\n2\nO, B, and Zn, and the transformed data passed the normality test.\nA dbf file consisting of data for X and Y coordinates with respect to sampling site location\nwas created in ArcGIS (version 10.2). Several digital map layers were then developed, using\nkriging in ArcMap, based on each soil chemical property at 1:25000 scale. The ranges for soil\npH are classified as strongly acidic (<5.5), moderately acidic (5.5 to 6.2), neutral (6.2 to 7),\nmoderately alkaline (7 to 7.8), and strongly alkaline (>7.8). Similarly, the rating charts for\nother soil parameters are given in Table 3, which is based on recommendations given by the\nSoil Management Directorate of the Department of Agriculture for the Terai region of Nepal\n[22].\nThe kriging method uses semivariance to estimate the spatial distribution structure of the\nsoil properties [37–38]. Semivariogram modeling and estimation are essential for structural\nanalysis and spatial interpolation, which is akin to fitting a least-squares line in regression anal-\nysis [39]. It produces geostatistical parameters, including nugget, structural, sill, and range\nTable 2.

The spatial dependency (Sp. D) of soil parameters (the ratio of nugget to sill variances) is\nexpressed as a percentage [40]. To ensure Sp. D, as a rule of thumb the sampling interval (lag)\nshould be less than half of the range of the spatial variation [15]. If the ratio is less than 0.25,\nthe variance has strong Sp. D and if the ratio ranges between 0.25 and 0.75, the variance has\nmoderate Sp. D [41].\nMoran’s I Index was used to measure spatial autocorrelation between sample points on the\nsemivariagram cloud, which was evaluated using z-scores. Values greater than 1.96 or smaller\nthan −1.96 are significant at p < 0.05 [42]. Similarly, the mean error (ME) and root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) was used for a cross-validation approach (or any given variogram model)\nto evaluate the accuracy or best fit of the kriging tool [43]. A ME value close to zero indicates\nthat the interpolation method is unbiased. The lowest RMSE value indicates the best fit to the\nvariogram model.\nData analysis\nDescriptive statistics and geostatistics were used to analyze the dataset, and descriptive statis-\ntics along with a normality test were run in SAS software. All maps were produced using GIS\nsoftware ArcMap (version 10.2) and its spatial analyst and geostatistical analysis extensions.\nThe structure of spatial variability was analyzed through semivariogram. Spatial distribution\nwas analyzed through kriging interpolation.\nResults and discussion\nDescriptive statistics for soil chemical properties\nThe commonly used descriptive statistical summary of the pH, OM, N, P\n2\nO\n5\n, K\n2\nO, Zn, and B\nis presented in Table 2. The variability was interpreted using the coefficient of variation (CV)\nand classified into most (CV: >35%), moderate (CV: 15 to 35%) and least (CV: <15%) variable\nranges [44]. The CV ranged from 16.0% (in pH) to 97.12% (in K\n2\nO). The range of CV for the\nsoil sampling locations suggested different degrees of heterogeneity among the properties\nstudied.\nThe pH values were ranging from 4.2 to 8 with a mean of 6.4, which was also similar to the\nmedian value of 6.4. The concentration of OM was low (ranging from 1 to 2.5%), with a mean\nof 2.13%. Total N was relatively low (ranging from 0.05 to 0.01%) with a median of 0.09%,\nthough the mean was 0.11%.

Those datasets were then subjected to\nlogarithmic transformation to narrow down the skew and kurtosis values (Table 2) and the\ntransformed datasets were subsequently used in the spatial analysis.\nDigital soil maps using kriging\nDigital maps of soil chemical properties were produced by using kriging on the log trans-\nformed dataset, and the results (shown in Figs 2 through 8) were grouped into various classes\nbased on the range representing their magnitude in the soil. The estimated area of each class is\ngiven in Table 4.\nSoil pH. Soil pH varied from strongly acidic (< 5.5) in 21.12% to strongly alkaline (> 7.8)\nin 2.48% of the total area (Table 4 and Fig 2). These results are in agreement with those\nreported in a recent study of soils of the Terai region [22, 45]. The variation in soil pH could\nbe attributed to the nature of the alluvial parent material, micro topography, and the type and\nhistory of fertilizer used [46]. The losses of basic cation and other nutrients through erosion\nand leaching leaves the hydrogen and aluminum ions that can cause soil acidity [47]. Manage-\nment practices such as crop nutrient uptake and harvest without replenishment [48] and poor\ncrop residue management lowers the pH and leads to low levels of soil OM [28, 49].\nUrea (46% N) and di-ammonium phosphate (18% N and 46% P) are the most commonly\nused fertilizers by Nepalese farmers. The national average for the use of chemical fertilizer has\nincreased dramatically from 16.7 kg ha\n−1\nin 2002 to 67.4 kg ha\n−1\nin 2014 [50]. Of the major fer-\ntilizer nutrients, types of N fertilizer containing ammonium-N are the main factors affecting\nFig 2. Soil pH spatial variabi lity map in southern part of Bara district, Nepal.

As the ammonium-N in fertilizers undergoes nitrification, hydrogen ions are released,\nwhich can increase acidity [51], and Tripathi and Shrestha [52] reported an increase of acidity\nup to 4.1 (in 2000) from 5.6 (in 1997) after the application of fertilizers at four locations in\nwestern Nepal.\nPlant growth and most soil processes are favored by a specific pH range. The low pH leads\nto Al and Mn toxicity, along with deficiency and/or unavailability of plant nutrients such as\nP, Ca, K, Mg, and Mo as observed by Dembele et al. [53] and Tisdale et al. [54]. To produce a\nsustained crop growth and yield, efforts should be made to increase the pH, which can be\naddressed through liming and OM management or adoption of the acid tolerant crops.\nSoil organic matter. Soil OM was relatively low (1 to 2.5%) in the majority (48.8%) of the\nstudy area, followed by very low (<1%) in 26.88% (Table 4 and Fig 3). The low organic content\nTable 4.

A\nstudy conducted in the Dhading district of Nepal in 2003 showed that 37% of crop residue was\nused to feed livestock, 35% was used as fuel, 15% was burnt on lands, and the remaining 13%\nwas incorporated into the soil through methods other than burning [57].\nAnother possible reason for low OM is a high soil OM decomposition rate resulting from\nsoil and higher air temperature that decreases soil organic carbon (SOC). The SOC is affected\nby the addition of farm yard manure (FYM), tillage, and cropping pattern [58–59]. Around\n14.56% of the study area revealed medium (2.5 to 5%) levels of soil OM, which could be due to\nwaterlogged conditions, leading to shallow rooting and the confinement of biological activity\nto the upper soil layer. Similar results were reported by Shrestha et al. [60] for the soils of low-\nland irrigated rice fields in Nepal.\nAmong Nepalese farmers, there is an increase in the use of chemical fertilizer in agriculture,\nthough this increase is not being matched by an increase in the use of organic manure\n(manures, organic fertilizers, compost, or other soil improvers) [61]. The present rate of\norganic manure application is 2.5 to 3 t ha\n-1\nfor soil fertility management [62], with an esti-\nmated composition of 0.5% N, 0.2% P, and 1.25% K on a dry weight basis, far below the global\naverage and a rate that may not meet crop demand on a long-term basis [63–64]. As OM\ndecreases, it also decreases available N, P, K, and some micronutrients [65]. Zhao et al. [66]\nreported that this low level of OM is indication of soil degradation and a high risk of soil ero-\nsion. Farmers should be encouraged to add much crop residues to the soil along with manure\nand compost.\nTotal nitrogen. Usually, N has a greater effect on crop growth, crop quality, and yield.\nHowever, N was deficient in most of the areas with values <0.1 (low and very low) recorded in\n70.5% of the total area (Table 4 and Fig 4). The variation in N content in different parts of the\nstudy area may be related to soil management, application of FYM and applied fertilizer to pre-\nvious crops, etc. [67]. The acute deficiency of N is due to low OM content, increased rate of\nmineralization, and insufficient application of N fertilizer to nutrient exhausting crops like\nwheat and maize [46]. The rate of soil OM decomposition and N mineralization holds complex\ninteractions with the microbial population and other environmental factors, mainly soil mois-\nture and temperature. A field with 40 kg N ha\n-1\nof soil nitrate build-up led to the loss of N from\nthe entire field when the soil, which contained moisture levels > 46%, filled pore space at the\nonset of the monsoon rains in a lowland field in the west central part of Chitwan, Nepal [68].\nAvailable phosphorus. The available P\n2\nO\n5\nwas medium in 42.95% and low in 29.88% of\nthe study area (Table 4 and Fig 5). The low level of OM may account for the low level of avail-\nable P\n2\nO\n5\nin the soils. However, the relatively higher availability of P\n2\nO\n5\nobserved in some\nareas may be due to the dissolution of Ca-P under neutral soil reaction under cultivated condi-\ntions [69–70]. Phosphorous is more directly affected by soil pH than other major plant nutri-\nents such as N, K, and S; for example, at alkaline values, greater than pH 7.5, the HPO\n4\n2-\nphosphate ions tend to react quickly with calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) to form less solu-\nble compounds. At acidic pH values, the H\n2\nPO\n4\n-\nphosphate ions react with aluminum (Al)\nand iron (Fe) to again form less soluble compounds [71]. Soils with inherent pH values\nbetween 6 and 7.5 are ideal for P availability. Besides pH, the amount of OM and the placement\nof P fertilizers also control the availability of P\n2\nO\n5\n, whereas erosion and runoff are associated\nwith its loss from soil. Studies from many developed countries have shown that the use of flue\ngas desulfurization gypsum, a source of Ca and S, can be used as a soil amendment, especially\nto reduce soil and soluble P loss from agricultural fields and improve acidic soils [72]. Hence,\nwhether or not farmers attempt to adjust pH levels, it is important to understand methods to\nincrease the availability and use of added nutrients [73].\nDigital soil mapping in the Bara district of Nepal using kriging tool in ArcGIS\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02063 50 October 26, 2018 12 / 20\nAvailable potassium. The available K\n2\nO was at low levels in the majority of the study\narea (Table 4 and Fig 6). Soil pH also affects the availability of K\n2\nO. When soil pH is greater\nthan 7, the greater Ca concentration increases the K availability through the displacement of\nexchangeable K by Ca. Conversely, when soil pH is less than 5.5, the reduction in Ca concen-\ntration reduce the K availability. In addition, low levels of OM due to low clay content, high\nhydraulic conductivity, and possible nutrient losses through leaching and erosion without\nreplenishment also reduces the K level [74]. Water for irrigation to many of these study areas\ncomes from Nepal’s rivers, which are flooded during monsoon season and carry heavy sedi-\nments (for example, mica) a source of exchangeable K [75]. However, due to year-round\ncropping practices, there is very little time for K to release from sediments and remain in\nthe exchangeable site [76]. This could be another reason why the majority of the study area\nincluded low amounts of K\n2\nO.\nZinc and boron. The micronutrient Zn was low and B was at medium level throughout\nthe study area (Table 4 and Figs 7 and 8), possibly due to unfavorable soil pH (moderately alka-\nline in 30.69% of the total study area), intensive cropping, the use of high yielding varieties,\nand different fertilizer application strategies practiced by smallholder farmers. The Khaira dis-\nease (leaf bronzing) in rice due to Zn deficiency [77–78] and sterility in wheat induced by an\ninadequate B supply [79–82] are major concerns in the study area. In a study of micronutrient\ndeficiencies in grain legumes, Srivastava et al. [83] found that B severely restricted the growth\nof lentils (Lens culinaris M.), chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.), and pigeonpeas (Cajanus cajan L.)\nin the Terai region. Since rice is the major staple crop in Nepal, farmers use zinc sulphate\n(ZnSO\n4\n) before transplanting or sowing at the time of land preparation, along with a combina-\ntion of ZnSO\n4\nand lime during the growing stage, if the crop is infected [84].\nFarmers’ practice and use of digital soil maps. In many developing countries including\nNepal, soil fertility management recommendations are solely based on soil types and agro-eco-\nlogical zones. Details about soil pH range and the recommended agricultural lime rate, as well\nas the recommended doses of chemical fertilizers for specific crops in Nepal are given in Pan-\ndey et al. [22]. Despite the advisory recommendation made from research, farmers do not\napply balanced doses of fertilizer, and instead use mostly acid forming nitrogenous fertilizers.\nMost of the farmers apply FYM to their lands at the same rate as it is produced. The practice\nfor FYM preparation and application is not an improved one because farmers dump FYM in\nopen spaces and expose it to the sun, wind, and rain for several days before ploughing [85].\nFarmers also follow nutrient-exhaustive high-yielding crop varieties under intensive cropping\nall year-round, leading a heavy loss of nutrients after every harvest. Therefore, a balanced rate\nof chemical fertilizers and organic manures must be applied every year.\nMaps that characterize the spatial distribution of each soil property can be produced using\nkriging to group individual fields into potentially low- and high-productivity areas. Hence,\nmanagement strategies to enhance soil nutrients could be implemented in the study area by\nusing these DSMs as a guide [86], such as famers following fertilizer recommendations based\non buildup and maintenance levels. Normally, nutrient values that are at low levels require\nrelatively higher amount of fertilizer application; therefore, these DSMs may lead to proper\nunderstanding of existing farm soils by allowing easier management and maintaining the sus-\ntainability of productivity. This research sets a precedent for future DSM in other parts of the\ncountry.\nGeostatistics for soil chemical properties\nSemivariogram analysis. The semivariogram model and some of the geostatistical param-\neters of soil chemical properties are shown in Table 5. Based on the lowest root mean square\nDigital soil mapping in the Bara district of Nepal using kriging tool in ArcGIS\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02063 50 October 26, 2018 13 / 20\nerror (RMSE), different theoretical semivariogram models were selected for the significant fit\nof soil chemical properties [87]. An exponential model provided the best fit to the semivario-\ngram of pH, OM, N, and Zn. The spherical model was the best fit to the semivariogram of K\n2\nO\nand B, whereas Gaussian was the best fit for P\n2\nO\n5\n. Many findings suggest that the exponential\nmodel is the most suitable for assessing spatial variability in soil chemical properties [88–92]\nbecause it explains the maximum variability in the spatial dataset [93–94].\nTable 6 shows that Sp. D of soil parameters ranged from 0.3 (in N) to 0.92 (in Zn). There\nwas a moderate (in N, OM, P\n2\nO\n5\n, and pH) and weak (in K\n2\nO, Zn, and B) Sp. D. of the kriging\nmodel, which could be attributed to external factors such as variable rates of fertilizer applica-\ntion and incorporation of amendments by farmers within a cropped region. The ranges of spa-\ntial dependencies were large and vary between 4951 m for OM to 5945 m for P\n2\nO\n5\nindicating\nthat the optimum sampling interval varies greatly among different soil properties. Determina-\ntion of the range values provides an idea of the correlation between different sampling loca-\ntions, along with the maximum spatial dependence distance between them [95]. Fluctuation in\nthe range with different lag sizes indicates that spatial structure may merely be regarded with a\nsingle model for semivariogram [96]. This difference may not be important for semivariance\ncalculation, but it may be important if the purpose is to understand the underlying spatial\nstructure of the data [97].\nSpatial autocorrelation. The analysis of spatial autocorrelation based on Global Moran’s\nI Index was used to identify the spatial pattern soil chemical properties that may be dispersed,\nrandom, or clustered based on feature locations and attribute values simultaneously [42], as\npresented in Table 6. The hypothesis for the pattern analysis was that the soil chemical proper-\nties (including pH, OM and some nutrients) across the study area were randomly distributed.\nAccording to ESRI [98], for the theory of random patterns, when the p-value is very\nsmall (in this study, p < 0.05) and the z-score is either very high or very low (1.96 < z\nand z < −1.96), the spatial pattern is not likely to reflect a random form of distribution.\nA positive Moran’s I index value indicates the neighboring values are similar, suggesting\nspatial dependency. A negative Moran’s I index value indicates the neighboring values are\nTable 5.

A Moran’s I index value of zero implies a\nlack of spatial pattern [99–101]. With the exception of K\n2\nO, all other soil variables had a\npositive Moran’s I index for their spatial pattern (Table 6).\nTest of significance for values returned by the analysis of the major soil chemical properties\nindicated that pH, OM, N and Zn showed clustered distributions in the study area, with low\nlevels clustered at one location and high levels at the other (no figures included). On the other\nhand, the pattern of distribution of P\n2\nO\n5\n, K\n2\nO and B did not appear significantly different\nfrom a random distribution at p < 0.05.\nConclusions\nThe application of the geostatistical approach, including descriptive statistics and semivario-\ngram analysis, improved the description of spatial variability for soil chemical properties at 0\nto 15 cm depth on a field scale. The descriptive statistics showed that most of the measured\nsoil chemical variables were skewed and non-normally distributed and the available K\n2\nO data\nwere highly variable (5 to 696 kg ha\n-1\n). Geostatistical interpolation identified that exponential,\nspherical, or Gaussian models provided the best fit to the semivariograms, depending on the\nsoil chemical variable and, in general, showed weak or moderate spatial dependency for all of\nthe variables. The kriging maps of soil chemical properties were found effective in explaining\nthe distribution of soil properties in non-sampled locations based on sampled data. These\nmaps aid farmers in to making efficient management decisions based on their proper under-\nstanding of the conditions of existing farm soils. These results show geostatistical analysis\nusing kriging is an effective prediction tool for exploring the spatial variability of soil nutrients,\nand we recommend this tool for future soil sampling campaigns in Nepal.\nSupporting information\nS1 File.
