  "abstract": "The traditional power transformer diagnosis method relies on a lot of experience knowledge and a complex sampling process, which brings great difficulties to the fault diagnosis work. To solve this problem, a fault feature extraction method based on fully adaptive noise set empirical mode decomposition (CEEMDAN) is proposed, and the hunter–prey optimization (HPO) algorithm is used to optimize the support vector machine (SVM) to identify and classify the voice print faults of power transformers. Firstly, the CEEMDAN algorithm is used to decompose the voicemarks into several IMF components. IMF components containing fault information are selected according to the envelope kurtosis index and reconstructed to generate new signal sequences. PCA dimensionality reduction is performed on the reconstructed signal, and the principal components are extracted with a high cumulative contribution rate as input to SVM. Then, the HPO-SVM algorithm is used to classify and identify transformer faults. Apply the proposed method to the diagnosis of typical faults in power transformers. The results show that the accuracy of this method in identifying various fault states of power transformers can reach 98.5%, and it has better classification performance than other similar methods.",
