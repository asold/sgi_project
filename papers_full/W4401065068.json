  "abstract": "HIGHLIGHTS 1. The article highlights how Artificial Intelligence with Large Language Models (AI-LLMs) greatly improves diagnosis and treatment personalization in obstetrics &amp; gynecology, and also enhances medical education through interactive simulations and up-to-date learning materials.2. The article also discusses the ethical issues linked to AI, emphasizing the need for cooperation among different stakeholders to use AI responsibly in medicine, focusing on protecting data privacy and minimizing reliance on technology. ABSTRACT The introduction of Artificial Intelligence through Large Language Models (AI-LLM) into medicine holds great promise for improving patient care and medical education, especially in obstetrics and gynecology. AI-LLM can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficiency by utilizing large medical databases, which is especially useful for dealing with rare diseases that are difficult to document or understand by human practitioners alone. In addition, AI-LLM can provide informed patient care recommendations by analyzing large amounts of data and providing insights based on unique patient profiles, with the added benefit of being accessible 24/7 via the internet. This constant availability ensures that patients receive prompt information and assistance as needed. In the field of education, AI-LLMs enhance the learning experience by incorporating interactive simulations into the curriculum, improving medical students' and professionals' practical knowledge. They also ensure that educational materials are always up-to-date reflecting the most recent research and worldwide medical standards. This access latest information from global resources helps to bridge the educational gap, making advanced knowledge more accessible to learners regardless of their geographic location. However, the introduction of AI-LLMs is not without challenges. Ethical issues, such as data privacy and the risk of overreliance on technology, must be addressed. Effective management of these concerns necessitates collaboration among medical professionals, technological experts, academics, hospital committees, and representatives of patients. This multidisciplinary teamwork is vital for upholding ethical norms and preserving patient dignity and respect. AI-LLMs can considerably improve both patient care and medical education in obstetrics and gynecology provided they are appropriately balanced with innovation and ethics.",
