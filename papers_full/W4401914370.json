  "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has brought new perspectives and methods to automatic modulation recognition (AMR), enabling AMR systems to operate more efficiently and reliably in modern wireless communication environments through its powerful feature learning and complex pattern recognition capabilities. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are used for sequence recognition tasks, face two main challenges, respectively: the ineffective utilization of global information and slow processing speeds due to sequential operations. To address these issues, this paper introduces CTRNet, a novel automatic modulation recognition network that combines a CNN with Transformer. This combination leverages Transformer’s ability to adequately capture the long-distance dependencies between global sequences and its advantages in sequence modeling, along with the CNN’s capability to extract features from local feature regions of signals. During the data preprocessing stage, the original IQ-modulated signals undergo sliding-window processing. By selecting the appropriate window sizes and strides, multiple subsequences are formed, enabling the network to effectively handle complex modulation patterns. In the embedding module, token vectors are designed to integrate information from multiple samples within each window, enhancing the model’s understanding and modeling ability of global information. In the feedforward neural network, a more effective Bilinear layer is employed for processing to capture the higher-order relationship between input features, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to capture complex patterns. Experiments conducted on the RML2016.10A public dataset demonstrate that compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm not only exhibits significant advantages in terms of parameter efficiency but also achieves higher recognition accuracy under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, it performs relatively well in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with clearer classification of higher-order modulations and notable overall accuracy improvement.",
