  "abstract": "Accurate recognition of fruits in the orchard is an important step for robot picking in the natural environment, since many CNN models have a low recognition rate when dealing with irregularly shaped and very dense fruits, such as a grape bunch. It is a new trend to use a transformer structure and apply it to a computer vision domain for image processing. This paper provides Swin Transformer and DETR models to achieve grape bunch detection. Additionally, they are compared with traditional CNN models, such as Faster-RCNN, SSD, and YOLO. In addition, the optimal number of stages for a Swin Transformer through experiments is selected. Furthermore, the latest YOLOX model is also used to make a comparison with the Swin Transformer, and the experimental results show that YOLOX has higher accuracy and better detection effect. The above models are trained under red grape datasets collected under natural light. In addition, the dataset is expanded through image data augmentation to achieve a better training effect. After 200 epochs of training, SwinGD obtained an exciting mAP value of 94% when IoU = 0.5. In case of overexposure, overdarkness, and occlusion, SwinGD can recognize more accurately and robustly compared with other models. At the same time, SwinGD still has a better effect when dealing with dense grape bunches. Furthermore, 100 pictures of grapes containing 655 grape bunches are downloaded from Baidu pictures to detect the effect. The Swin Transformer has an accuracy of 91.5%. In order to verify the universality of SwinGD, we conducted a test under green grape images. The experimental results show that SwinGD has a good effect in practical application. The success of SwinGD provides a new solution for precision harvesting in agriculture.",
