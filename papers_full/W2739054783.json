Introduction \nIt is important to detect the mechanical condition \nand the change trend of the transformer winding. \nWhen the transformer short-circuit occurs, due to \nthe generated leakage magnetic field, the winding \nwill produce a greater force. The axial \nelectro-dynamic force is generated internally to the \nwinding by the radial component of the leakage \nmagnetic flux. It can make the coil outward \nexpansion, even causing the winding deformation \nfault [1, 2]. Nowadays, the major detection methods \nfor the winding condition include the short-circuit \nimpedance method and the frequency response \nanalysis (FRA) method. These two methods require \nhigh precision and anti-interference, so the systems \nare more complex. If the performances are not good \nenough, the monitoring results will produce a \ngreater error. The optical fiber technology has many \nadvantages, such as anti-interference ability, high \nprecision, good repeatability, and simple installation, \nespecially for the transformer winding dynamic \naxial force on-line monitoring [3]. At present, there \nare many domestic and international studies on the \npressure sensitizing structure, packaging materials \nand technology, and temperature compensation \nmethods of pressure sensors based on fiber Bragg \ngrating (FBG) [4, 5]. The common FBG-based \npressure sensor can be divided into the polymer \nencapsulation, planar diaphragm packaging, and \nother different sensitization structures according to \ndifferent package types and structures [6]. For \ngeneral polymer packaging, the temperature and \npressure cross sensitivity is not suitable for high \ntemperature measurement although the pressure is \nsensitive. For the planar diaphragm packaging, the \nReceived: 17 April 2017 / Revised: 21 June 2017 \n© The Author(s) 2017. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com \nDOI: 10.1007/s13320-017-0427-z \nArticle type: Regular \n                                                                                             Photonic Sensors  \n \n366 \nsmall changes in the diaphragm easily lead to \nuneven pressure to generate d signal distortion. In \naddition, in order to meet the requirements of \ndynamic measurement, the dynamic response of the \nwinding is required to satisfy the requirements of the \ninstantaneous strain recovery of the packaging \nstructure and material [7]. In this paper, according to \nthe characteristic of winding axial force, a new type \nof FBG-based pressure sensor based on the bending \nbeam sensitivity structure is designed, and the \nreference fiber grating method effectively solves the \nproblem of temperature cross sensitivity, and the \nexperiment and field test are carried out. \n2. Fiber-optic sensoring principles \n2.1 FBG sensoring principle \nFBG-based sensor works like a wavelength \nselector reflector, the incident light [wavelength \n( B )] satisfying the Bragg diffraction condition is \nreflected at FBG , and the other wavelengths pass \nthrough all without being affected [8]. The reflection \nspectrum peaks at the FBG central wavelength \nB  \nis given as \neff2B n Λ                ( 1 )  \nwhere B  is the central wavelength of the reflected \nlight, effn  is the effective refractive index, and Λ \nis the pitch. \nThe wavelength will change by the temperature \nand strain. The FBG based on the co-production of \ntemperature and strain can be expressed as \n/( 1 ) ()Be PE T            ( 2 )  \nwhere   is the change in wavelength, eP  is the \nphoto elastic coefficient, E  is the axial force, T  \nis the temperature change,   is the thermal \nexpansion coefficient of optical fiber, and   is the \nthermo-optical coefficient of optical fiber. \nIn order to solve the influence of temperature on \nthe pressure measurement, the reference grating \nmethod is used to eliminate the temperature effect, \nso the strain can be expressed as \n 11 2 2 /BB B B K             ( 3 )  \nwhere 1B  is the wavelength of FBG1, 2B  is the \nwavelength of FBG2, and K  is the pressure \nsensitivity coefficient. According to (3), the pressure \ncan be obtained without the influence of \ntemperature. \n2.2 Sensitivity structure design principle \nThere are beam, spoke, column, pressure ring, \nand other structures of pressure sensors with its \nelastomerric structures. Each has its own \ncharacteristics and advantages and is applied in \ndifferent occasions. In this paper, we use the \nbending plate structure to make up the fiber-optic \npressure sensor [9, 10]. In Fig.\n 1, the distributed load \ncan be decomposed into a set of 2 N+1 smaller \nconcentrated forces W(xi) as follows:  \n\n1\n2+ 1\n=\nN\nWW x i .              ( 4 )  \nIn order to achieve better dynamic sensitivity, \nwe should get the maximum deflection of sensor \nbeam, and the calculation formula is given as  \n  \n122 3\n02 34 4l/ i i ifW x l x E b h\n\n，  \n0/ 2 ix l                (5) \n  \n122 3\n2 () 3 4 () 4l/ l i i ifW l x l l xE b h\n\n  ，  \n/2 ilx l                 ( 6 )  \nwhere E  is the elastic modulus of beam, l  is the \ndistance of pressure from the fulcrum, b is the beam \nwidth, h is the beam height, and x is the left fulcrum \ndistance. \nAccording to (5) and (6), when /2ix l , the \ndeflection has the maximum value which is in the \nmiddle of the beam, and the formula is given as \nfollows: \n33 1\nmax (4 )f Wl Ebh\n\n .           ( 7 )  \nIn the case of other conditions unchanged, the \nmaximum deflection f in the middle of the beam \napproaches the force W. The sensitivity K is \nexpressed as follows:  \nmax=/ /KW  （） .           ( 8 )  \nThe sensor is designed by this structure of \nsquare bending plate beam. Three-dimensional stress \nsimulation of the sensor is shown in Fig.\n 1. \nYuan LIU et al.: Research on a New Fiber-Optic Axial Pressure Sensor of Transformer Winding Based on Fiber Bragg Grating \n \n367\n10 \n5 \n0 y \nz \nx \n20 \n0 \n20 \n20 \n0 \n20  \n0:000(mm)\n0.08\n0.07\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0\n0  \n10 \n5 \n0 \ny \nz \nx \n20 \n0 \n20\n20 \n0 \n20 \n00:000(mm)\n0.08\n0.07\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0\n0  \nFig. 1 Three-dimensional stress simulation of fiber-optic \nsensor. \nAccording to the analysis, when a load is applied \nto the upper part of the sensor, the sensor pressures \nare concentrated on the middle of the bow. The \npressure FBG is fixed in it. Further optimization of \nthe design of its structure is to make the wavelength \nchange of the FBG sensor in full-scale greater than  \n1\n nm. \n3. Sensor package and sensoring \nsystem \n3.1 Sensor package \nThe fiber-optic pressure sensor is used to \nmonitor the transformer winding axial force, \nbecause the material of the sensor has good \ninsulation, mechanical property, and high \ntemperature resistance. We select polyether ether \nKetone (PEEK) special engineering plastics as \nsensor’s substrate material. PEEK resin has \nadvantages of large rigidity, better dimensional \nstability, and very small linear expansion coefficient, \nand it is close to the metal aluminum material which \ncan be used at 250\n  ℃ for a long period. The \nfiber-optic pressure sensor is shown in Fig. 2. \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFig. 2 Structure drawing and photo of the fiber-optic \npressure sensor: (a) fiber-optic pressure sensor for package and \n(b) photograph of the fiber-optic pressure sensor. \nIn Fig.  2(a), it shows that there are two FBGs, \nnamely the pressured FBG1 and the referenced \nFBG2, which are enclosed in the groove. The FBG1, \nwhich measures the axial pressure, is located in the \narcuate groove which is in the center of the sensor \nand is pasted on the bottom of the groove by glue. \nThe FBG2, which measures the temperature, is in a \nnon-stressed state. When the upper plane or the \nlower plane of the fiber-optic pressure sensor is in \nforce, the arcuate groove is subjected to force, which \ncan cause the change in the wavelength of the FBG1. \n                                                                                             Photonic Sensors  \n \n368 \nSo the pressure which eliminates temperature effect \ncan be given by FBG1 and FBG2. \n3.2 Sensoring calibration and test experiment \nLight is emitted by the laser in the FBG \ndemodulator via coupler and fiber to the fiber-optic \npressure sensor and then is reflected by the FBG in \nthe sensor, and then, via optical fiber, coupler to \ndemodulation module which converts the optical \nsignal to electrical signal [11, 12]. The demodulator \nperformance indicators are: demodulation \nwavelength range: 1\n 522 nm‒1 567 nm, wavelength \nresolution: 0.1  pm, and data sampling frequency:   \n8 kHz. The relationship between the change in FBG \nwavelength, and the applied load can be obtained by \napplying different loads to the fiber-optic pressure \nsensor. \n \n \nFig. 3 Pressure sensor test system flow chart and picture. \nTo establish the calibration platform of FBG \npressure sensor, the platform picture is shown in  \nFig. 3. The equipment is constituted of manual \npressure pump, jack, structure platform, and \nhigh-precision pressure sensor (US transcell \nDBSL-XS-10T, its range is 0  T‒10 T, accuracy: \n0.05% FS). \nWhen the pressure sensor is calibrating, a high \nprecision pressure sensor is installed in the middle \nof the jack. The load points corresponding to 0  MPa, \n2 MPa, 4  MPa, 6 MPa, 8  MPa, 10  MPa, 12  MPa, and \n14 MPa are pressured by the manual hydraulic pump. \nThe sensor wavelength value and the pressure value \nof the high precision pressure sensor are recorded, \nand the corresponding relationship model is \nestablished as shown in Fig.\n 4. We add the \ntemperature disturbance in this experiment, and the \nwavelength shift caused by the temperature change \nof the reference grating FBG2 is eliminated on the \npressure grating FBG1 data. \n \nFig. 4 Pressure sensor calibration curve. \nThe linear relation between the pressure and \nwavelength is expressed as follows: \n=0.133 1540.812yx   \n       \n2\n0.999R  .               ( 9 )  \nIt can be seen that the linear correlation \ncoefficient of the sensor is 0.999, and the sensitivity \nof the sensor is 0.133 pm/kPa. \n4. Field test and result in transformer \nwinding \n4.1 Sensor installation \nThe winding axial force field test is carried out \nYuan LIU et al.: Research on a New Fiber-Optic Axial Pressure Sensor of Transformer Winding Based on Fiber Bragg Grating \n \n369\nby installing the fiber-optic pressure sensor inside \nthe transformer winding in Taikai transformer \nfactory. Two fiber-optic pressure sensors are \nrespectively installed on the upper and the lower \npressing plates of the transformer winding. The \nposition of the lower sensor is corresponding to the \nupper sensor, and the other sensor is installed in the \nmiddle part. The installation diagram is shown in \nFig.\n 5. When installing, the appropriate insulation \ngasket is selected for the pressure sensor to install. \nThe sensor is connected to the external optical fiber \ncable with the transformer transfixion device. The \nbottom of the transfixion sealed chamber is opened \nsome holes, and the external fiber cable is connected \nto the demodulator with the metal hose (no more \nthan 6\n km). The fiber-optic dynamic pressure sensors \nare placed in the insulation gasket. Figure  6 shows \nthe fiber-optic pressure sensor installation location \nand transfixion device. Figure 7 shows the field \npressure test system of transformer winding. \n \nFig. 5 FBG-based pressure sensor installation diagram. \n \n \nFig. 6 Fiber-optic pressure sens or installation location and \ntransfixion device. \n \n \nFig. 7 Field pressure test system of transformer winding. \n                                                                                             Photonic Sensors  \n \n370 \n4.2 Results analysis \nFigure 8 shows that each 5  MPa is used as a test \npoint, and a total of 5 test points are obtained. The \ndata curve shows that the data of the fiber optic \npressure sensors installed in the upper, middle and \nlower parts are the same basically. When the \nmaximum pressure is applied, the error of the three \nsensors is larger. \n \nFig. 8 Field test curve of fiber-optic pressure sensor. \nTable 1 shows the data of positive (order from \nsmall to large) and negative (order from large to \nsmall) stroke calibrations of the sensor. So that the \nrepeatability error can be calculated as \n3 100%sF SSy             ( 1 0 )  \nwhere S  is the standard deviation of the sensors, \nand F Sy   is the full scale output value for the \npressure sensor. According the calculation, the \nrepeatability error is \n2.7%S  . \nTable 1 Positive and negative stroke error data. \nPressure (MPa) Positive stroke (nm） Negative stroke (nm) Error (nm)\n0 \n2 \n4 \n6 \n8 \n10 \n12 \n14 \n1540.819 \n1541.079 \n1541.343 \n1541.611 \n1541.873 \n1542.149 \n1542.406 \n1542.682 \n1540.819 \n1541.077 \n1541.340 \n1541.608 \n1541.868 \n1542.145 \n1542.404 \n1542.682 \n0.000 \n0.002 \n0.003 \n0.003 \n0.005 \n0.004 \n0.002 \n0.000 \nThe dynamic measurement of the pressure \nsensor is carried out in order to investigate the \ndynamic sensing ability.

Conclusions \nAccording to the measurement of axial pressure \nof transformer winding, a new kind of FBG-based \naxial pressure sensor based on the design of bending \nplate beam is designed. The sensitivity of the sensor \nis 0.133\n pm/kPa, and the repeatability error is   \n2.7% FS. The transformer winding field experiment \nshows that the installation of the FBG-based \npressure sensor is more convenient and \nanti-interference, and the field data of the sensor in \ndifferent positions are basically consistent and \nrepeatable, which can meet the need of the \nmeasurement of the axial pressure of the winding. In \nthe future, the packaging materials of the \nFBG-based pressure sensor can be optimized to \nreduce the anisotropy affection between the winding \ninsulation gasket and the sensor material. To \nmeasure a large amount of data to establish the \nanalysis model of transformer winding axial force in \ndifferent positions, further simulation analysis is \ncarried out to provide a reliable data model for the \npressure monitoring of the transformer winding in \noperation. \nAcknowledgment \nThis work was partly supported by the Natural \nScience Fund Plan of Shandong Province (No. \n2016ZRC01104) and Natural Science Foundation \nDoctoral Fund of Shandong Province (No. \nZR2016FB03).  \n \nOpen Access  This article is distributed under the terms \nof the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International \nLicense (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by/4.0/), \nYuan LIU et al.: Research on a New Fiber-Optic Axial Pressure Sensor of Transformer Winding Based on Fiber Bragg Grating \n \n371\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and \nreproduction in any medium, provided you give \nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, \nprovide a link to the Creative Commons license, and \nindicate if changes were made. \n \nReferences \n[1] W.
