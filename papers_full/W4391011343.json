However, two major concerns arise in this\n1https://openai.com/\narXiv:2401.07216v1  [cs.IR]  14 Jan 2024\nCHIIR ’24, March 10–14, 2024, Sheffield, United Kingdom Pathiyan Cherumanal et al.\nsetting: (i) the risk of giving away sensitive data about the organiza-\ntion [7, 19]; and (ii) the limited access to structured and comprehen-\nsible documentation might impede practitioners (e.g., data scientists\nwithout a strong background on information retrieval) grasp of the\nprinciples, theories, and best practices influencing product quality.\nEfforts have been taken in this direction of bringing together re-\nsearchers and experts in conversational information-seeking with\nindustry practitioners to deal with real-world problems – as in the\ncase of Amazon’s Alexa Prize challenges [1, 14, 16].\nWe aim to combine our diverse research expertise in machine\nlearning, natural language processing, and information retrieval, to\nbring conversational search knowledge into action and address best\npractices for building an LLM-powered chatbot. Our goals are to\nexplore the challenges and approaches for implementing a chatbot,\ncompare various methods, and offer best practices in evaluation that\nstakeholders (not necessarily experts in conversational information\nseeking) can effectively use to assess and improve the quality of\nchatbot products.\nUsing a manually curated Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nguide from RMIT University’s School of Computing Technologies as\na Knowledge Base (KB), we were able to implement a conversational\nagent, named Walert2, that allows potential future students to get\nanswers to questions related to the computer science programs\noffered at RMIT University.3\nIn this demo, the primary focus was to characterize the chal-\nlenges associated with integrating LLMs into the development pro-\ncess of voice-based conversational information-seeking systems\nbased on an existing KB. The process allowed us to address chal-\nlenges related to (i) handling private/sensitive information by de-\nploying our instance of an open-source LLM; (ii) monitoring the\nproblem of hallucinations (i.e., the introduction of facts that are\nnot true) [9] and generation of inaccurate information by using\na human-in-the-loop approach [6] and the inclusion of out of KB\nquestions in our testbed; and (iii) evaluating the effectiveness of\nintent-based using Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), both at component and\nend-to-end levels. Our evaluation highlights shortcomings in recent\nRAG pipeline studies, particularly regarding the lack of ranking\nevaluation.\n2 METHODOLOGY\nTwo different approaches were used to implement the prototype\nof our application: Intent-Based (IB) and RAG. The first one, IB, is\nsuitable for structured and predictable interactions (i.e., pre-defined\nintents), while RAG chatbots retrieve information from a KB and are\nbetter for open domain and more dynamic conversations. Figure 1\npresents the overall framework for both approaches.\n2.1 Data Collection and Testbed\nWe utilized a manually curated FAQ from RMIT University’s School\nof Computing Technologies as a KB. The FAQ contains a wide range\nof common questions that incoming students ask regarding course\n2The term “Walert” means “possum” in the native languages of the Woi Wurrung and\nBoon Wurrung peoples. Possum skin cloaks are essential to the Traditional Owners\nand Custodians of the land where the authors live and work. Our chatbot, Walert, is\nnamed as a tribute to this cultural heritage [4, 15].\n3https://www.rmit.edu.au/partner/hubs/race/news\nLarge\nLanguage\nModel (Falcon)\nPassages\nQuestions\nHuman in\nthe Loop\nConversational\nAgent\nTraining\nParaphrases\nAmazon\nEcho\nIntent-Based (IB)\nRetrieval-Augmented \nGeneration (RAG)\nGenerated\nAnswer\nIndex Retrieved\nPassages\nLarge\nLanguage\nModel (Falcon)\nRetrieval\nModel\n1\n2\n3\nUser's Question\nFigure 1: Overall architecture of the two approaches imple-\nmented in Walert: IB and RAG.\nofferings and academic programs related to computer science. Us-\ning the question-answer pairs in the FAQ, we generate a set of\nquestions 𝑄 and passages 𝑃. The question set 𝑄 = {𝑞1,𝑞2,...,𝑞 𝑛}\ncontains existing questions in the FAQ that have known answers\n(i.e., passages directly extracted from the FAQ), new questions with\ninferred answers (i.e., manually generated questions that have no\ndirect answers but the answer can be inferred from multiple pas-\nsages in the FAQ), and questions that do not have an answer in\nthe KB (questions were manually generated by checking that they\ncannot be answered with the passages in the KB).\nTo simulate the scenario of different users expressing similar\nquestions differently, we generated multiple semantically equiva-\nlent variations for each unique question initially included in the\nFAQ. The passages set𝑃 = {𝑝1,𝑝2,...,𝑝 𝑚}is a corpus of passages\nextracted from the FAQ, representing our KB. Finally, each question\nis associated with a gold answer from a set 𝐴= {𝑎1,...,𝑎 𝑛}. Each\nanswer 𝑎 is obtained from one or more passages. We created a\ntestbed that consists of relevance judgments at the passage level\nand gold answers for three types of questions:\nQuestions with Known Answers (Known).These questions have\na direct answer in the FAQ. Therefore, the corresponding passage𝑝\nto the answer 𝑎in the FAQ is judged as Highly Relevant (label = 2).\nAll questions related to the same topic have the same passage judged\nas relevant, which is also the gold answer (𝑝 = 𝑎).\nQuestions with Inferred Answers (Inferred).Questions that do\nnot have a direct answer in the FAQ, but have an answer that can\nbe extracted from the KB, i.e., from one or more passages. Passages\nthat partially contain relevant information to answer the question\nare judged as Partially Relevant (label = 1). The gold answer is\nmanually generated by combining multiple passages.\nOut-of-Knowledge Base Questions (Out of KB).These questions\ncannot be answered with the information available in the KB –\neven though, these questions are within the domain and likely\nto be asked. Therefore, there are no relevant passages, and the\ngold answer consists of communicating to the user that there is no\ninformation available to answer that question.\nTable 1 shows example passages and answers for each question\ntype. We have 106 questions (including variations) and 120 passages.\nIn our collection, 84 questions have known answers (passages di-\nrectly extracted from the FAQ), 12 have inferred answers, and 10\ndo not have an answer in the KB. These three question types in\nWalert CHIIR ’24, March 10–14, 2024, Sheffield, United Kingdom\nour testbed provide a comprehensive evaluation that allows us to\ncompare IB against RAG conversational approaches.\nIn particular, using the questions with known answers, we can\nassess the system’s ability to correctly respond to questions for\nwhich we know a passage in the KB contains the complete answer.\nBy evaluating the effectiveness of the answers for the questions\nwith inferred answers, we can assess the system’s ability to gen-\nerate answers by combining multiple (partially) relevant passages.\nFinally, including questions not covered in the FAQ helps assess\nthe chatbot’s ability to identify unanswerable questions – which is\na critical step in controlling hallucinations.\n2.2 Intent-Based (IB)\nThe IB approach consists of a conversational model built using\nAmazon Alexa Skills [16] (upper part of Figure 1). Each question\nin the FAQ is mapped to an intent in the conversational model, i.e.,\none of the possible actions recognizable by the system.4 Intuitively,\nthis approach aims to optimize the correctness of the answers (high\nprecision) but only handles a limited number of questions (low re-\ncall), i.e., those present in the FAQ (questions with known answers).\nBuilding effective intent recognition models requires multiple in-\nstances to train each intent. Since manually creating variations\nof training utterances is time-consuming, we experimented with\nusing open-source LLMs to automatically create semantically equiv-\nalent variations of utterances (i.e., training data augmentation). In\nour case, these instances would be the semantic variations of the\nquestions from the FAQ. We deployed Falcon-7B [2] in Amazon\nSageMaker Studio with a 5xlarge-GPU configuration5 to generate\nup to eight question variations for each intent (i.e., a question in the\nFAQ), using a zero-shot approach and the following prompt:“gen-\nerate up to eight paraphrases of the following question: QUESTION” .\nAfter manually inspecting the variations generated, we established\na threshold and selected the top five. These variations were then\nused to train the conversational model. We also normalized the\ninstances by resolving the acronyms (e.g., replacing CS with Com-\nputer Science) and used them along with the original questions for\ntraining, making it a total of six training instances per the intent of\nthe conversational model. The answers associated with the original\nquestions in the FAQ were used as responses returned for each\nquestion. The Alexa Skill was finally deployed in an Amazon Echo\n(5𝑡ℎ generation) device, which allowed users to interact with the\nsystem in an audio-only setting. To enable this, we utilized the\nAutomatic Speech Recognition and NLU features built into Amazon\nAlexa Skill.\n2.3 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nIn contrast to the precision-oriented IB approach, we sought to\ninvestigate a more open-ended methodology known as RAG [11].\nHere, we cover two use cases: (i) instances where the questions the\nuser raises vary from what is available in the FAQ, and(ii) scenarios\n4https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/create-intents-\nutterances-and-slots.html\n5We explored different alternatives that would allow us to better understand the\nprocess of managing a privacy-aware LLM solution in-house to avoid the potential\nleaking of sensitive data by using third-party solutions. We found this alternative to be\na good fit for our needs, also the most flexible for our future research, e.g., experiments\ninvolving fine-tuning.\nin which questions can only be answered using abstractive multi-\ndocument summarization from multiple passages in the KB. The\nRAG approach consists of two main stages (bottom part of Figure 1).\nThe initial stage involves retrieving potential passages that may\ncontain the answer, while the second stage involves generating a\nsummary from the top-𝐾 retrieved passages.\nFor the retrieval model, we experimented with two approaches:\n(i) Okapi BM25 [17] with default parameters (𝑘1 = 1.2; 𝑏 = 0.75)\nand (ii) dense retrieval using Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) [10] im-\nplementations in the pyserini toolkit [13]. To generate a summary\nfrom the top-𝐾 retrieved passages, we used the same LLM that was\nused to generate semantically equivalent variations of the questions\nfor the IB approach, i.e., falcon-7b-instruct (refer Section 2.2)\nalong with the following prompt to generate the summaries:\nGenerate an answer to be synthesized with text-to-speech for a\nvirtual assistant, the answer should be based on the retrieved\ndocuments for the following question. If the retrieved documents\nare not related to the question, then answer NA.\n[QUESTION + LIST OF 𝑘 PASSAGES]\nWe experimented with three top-heavy 𝑘 cutoffs: 1 (which is\ncomparable to IB), 3, and 5 top retrieved passages.\n3 QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION\nThe test collection created from the knowledge base described in\nSection 2, allows us to apply effectiveness evaluation practices to\ncompare our proposed approaches at both the component and end-\nto-end levels. Table 2 displays results for IB and RAG approaches\nusing evaluation measures across two dimensions: (i) retrieval ef-\nfectiveness (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain, NDCG [8])\nand (ii) natural language generation (BERTScore [20] and ROUGE-\n1 [12]). ROUGE and BERTScore have been used to quantify hal-\nlucinations in LLMs automatically [ 9]. All the results in Table 2\nhave been tested for statistical significance using Tukey’s HSD and\nsignificance level 𝛼 = 0.01. Below, we discuss the results across two\ndimensions separately.\nRetrieval Effectiveness. When it comes to retrieving a response,\nthe IB approach only retrieves one passage (i.e., the response associ-\nated with the recognized intent), whereas RAG approaches retrieve\nmultiple passages for a given question (and the final response is\ngenerated using the top-𝑘 passages). In our evaluation, we explore\ntop-heavy cutoffs 𝑘={1,3,5} to minimize the risk of hallucinations.\nTable 2 shows that, for the Known questions, IB and RAG using DPR\nhave comparable performance in terms of NDCG@1 and RAG ap-\nproaches perform better with more aggressive ranking truncation\n(𝑘 = 1). For the Inferred questions, RAG approaches outperform IB\n(which can only return, at most, a passage partially relevant to the\nquestion). RAG approaches benefit from more context, and BM25\nwith 𝑘 = 3 obtains the highest NDCG score. In terms of out-of-KB\nquestions, IB performs substantially better than RAG approaches,\nbeing able to identify 80% of the unanswerable questions. RAG-\nbased approaches fail by attempting to generate an answer for most\nof the questions, which means that it is likely to hallucinate instead\nof not warning the user about the lack of information in the KB.\nEnd-to-end evaluation. BERTScore and ROUGE-1 scores indi-\ncate that IB performs significantly better for the Known questions,\nwhereas RAG approaches are likely to generate better answers for\nCHIIR ’24, March 10–14, 2024, Sheffield, United Kingdom Pathiyan Cherumanal et al.\nTable 1: Examples of questions, relevant passages and gold answers in our testbed.\nQuestion Type Question Passage(s) Answer\nQuestions with\nKnown Answers\nIs the transfer from Asso-\nciate Degree to Bachelors au-\ntomatic?\nNo, it is not.

It is worth noting that the LLM tend to ben-\nefit from having less context (i.e., fewer passages in the prompt),\nachieving higher BERTScore and ROUGE-1 scores for lower cutoffs\nfor both RAG approaches. Results also corroborate that IB performs\nsignificantly better than RAG approaches for Out of KB questions.\n4 IMPACT AND FUTURE WORK\nWe built Walert, a conversational agent that answers FAQs about\nprograms of study offered in the School of Computing Technologies\nat RMIT University. The IB approach, deployed on an Amazon Echo\ndevice, was showcased as a demo at the university’s Open Day in\nAugust 2023 where potential future students learned about the use\nof LLM-based conversational systems and its risks and limitations.\nThe demo, which was also showcased to visiting high-school stu-\ndents in September 2023, generated university-wide interest and\nconnections, including the IT service team building a university-\nwide solution.\nThere are several limitations that we are aiming to address in fu-\nture work. The current demo relies upon a limited knowledge base\n(i.e., a manually curated FAQ). We aim to reproduce our methodol-\nogy with a more extensive set of documents, including brochures\nand internal web pages related to the delivery of CS programs.\nFurther research on evaluation measures (beyond BERTScore and\nROUGE) is needed to evaluate the validity of generated responses.\nWe aim to explore other evaluation measures, including those for\ntruncated rankings [3] and other dimensions of LLM-based conver-\nsational systems [18]. Finally, we plan to deploy RAG approaches\nto perform online experimentation.\nThe process of building Walert helped us not only to share com-\nplementary knowledge across our group but also to facilitate knowl-\nedge translation within the university. We believe the approach and\nthe lessons learned can help other researchers aiming to bridge the\ngap between experts and practitioners interested in building (and\ntesting) LLM-based conversational information-seeking systems.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWalert was designed and developed in the unceded lands of the\nWurundjeri and Boon Wurrung peoples of the eastern Kulin Nation.\nWe pay our respects to their Ancestors and Elders, past, present,\nand emerging.
