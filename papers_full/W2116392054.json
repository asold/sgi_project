Complete programme evaluations are a necessary prerequisite to continuous quality\nimprovements. Being able to refine, adapt and create tools that are suited to the realities and contexts of PA\nprogrammes for the elderly in order to support its continuous improvement is, therefore, crucial. Thus, the aim of\nthis study was to develop a self-assessment tool for PA programmes for the elderly.\nMethods: A 3-round Delphi process was conducted via the Internet with 43 national experts in PA for the elderly,\nmanagement and delivery of PA programmes for the elderly, sports management, quality management and\ngerontology, asking experts to identify the propositions that they considered relevant for inclusion in the self-\nassessment tool. Experts reviewed a list of proposed statements, based on the criteria and sub-criteria from the\nEuropean Foundation for Quality Management Excellence Model (EFQM) and PA guidelines for older adults and\nrated each proposition from 1 to 8 (disagree to agree) and modified and/or added propositions. Propositions\nreceiving either bottom or top scores of greater than 70% were considered to have achieved consensus to drop or\nretain, respectively.\nResults: In round 1, of the 196 originally-proposed statements (best practice principles), the experts modified 41,\nadded 1 and achieved consensus on 93. In round 2, a total of 104 propositions were presented, of which experts\nmodified 39 and achieved consensus on 53. In the last round, of 51 proposed statements, the experts achieved\nconsensus on 19. After 3 rounds of rating, experts had not achieved consensus on 32 propositions. The resulting\ntool consisted of 165 statements that assess nine management areas involved in the development of PA\nprogrammes for the elderly.\nConclusion: Based on experts’ opinions, a self-assessment tool was found in order to access quality of PA\nprogrammes for the elderly. Information obtained with evaluations would be useful to organizations seeking to\nimprove their services, customer satisfaction and, consequently, adherence to PA programmes, targeting the\nageing population.\nKeywords: physical activity, programmes, elderly, tool, evaluation, quality, adherence\n* Correspondence: anavalente@netvisao.pt\n1Research Centre in Physical Activity, Health and Leisure, Faculty of Sports,\nUniversity of Porto, Porto, Portugal\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nMarques et al.

It is widely\naccepted that the benefits of such programmes depend\non adherence to exercise, which is influenced by degree\nof enjoyment and satisfaction [5-10]. One of the most\nimportant factors in customer satisfaction is quality of\nservice [11-13]. Therefore, continual improvements in\nPA programmes for the elderly are important to elderly\nsatisfaction and adherence to PA.\nThe 3\nrd Benchmark from the Physical Activity and\nHealth Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) [14] holds that complete programme\nevaluations are an important and desired prerequisite to\ncontinuous quality improvements. Similarly, World\nHealth Organization (WHO) guidelines for the evalua-\ntion of health promotion emphasize the need to evaluate\nand propose the allocation of adequate evaluative\nresources [15].\nEvidence shows that quality matters, is measurable,\nmoveable and malleable [16], but also has costs [17].\nHowever, literature also shows that the costs of not\ndoing so are far greater [18,19]. Several studies have\nfocused on the advantages of quality schemes [20-22].\nWith the aim of helping organizations improve the qual-\nity of their services, the European Foundation for Qual-\nity Management (EFQM) introduced the EFQM\nExcellence Model in 1991. The EFQM Excellence Model\nis a non-prescriptive framework that is based on nine\ncriteria divided into 32 sub-criteria [13]. It promotes the\nuse of management methodologies based on objective\ncriteria that are applicable to all areas of business or ser-\nvices and constitutes an exercise in self-assessment. Self-\nassessment sheds light on areas requiring improvement,\nas well as on the processes and actions necessary to\ngenerate improvement.\nWhile numerous PA programmes have been designed\nfor the elderly in recent years - especially by the Public\nLocal Administration - their evaluation has been scarce.\nIn fact, few details are available on how these pro-\ngrammes have been developed, how they have been\nstructured, how service delivery is conducted and how\nresults are being achieved. The lack of a standard\napproach to assessing PA programmes for the elderly\nmakes it difficult to compare the quality of both the\nplanning and the delivery of such programmes. In this\nway, being able to refine, adapt and create tools that are\nsuited to the realities and contexts of PA programmes\nfor the elderly, and that improve these programmes, is\ntherefore important, not only to help programmes\nevaluate their ability to perform public health functions,\nbut to address local health needs and guide community\nhealth-planning efforts. Thus, the aim of this study is to\ndescribe the development of a quality self-assessment\ntool for PA programmes for the elderly.\nMethods\nA modified Delphi process was conducted using the\nInternet, from October 2009 to September 2010. The\nDelphi technique was developed in the 1950s by scien-\ntists at the Rand Corporation as a method of making\ninformed decisions based on expert opinion [23]. Since\nthen, it has been used to clarify a variety of problems in\ndifferent sectors [24-29]. Despite having undergone\nsome modifications, it remains a viable approach for\ngathering expert opinions through a structured iterative\nprocess that builds consensus [30]. This process involves\nmultiple interactions with participants who usually com-\np l e t et w oo rm o r er o u n d si nar e a s o n a b l ea m o u n to f\ntime [31] - even when participants are in geographi-\ncally-distinct locations, since rounds can be conducted\nby mail or email [32,33]. The results of previous itera-\ntions can be modified by participants in later iterations,\nas they are able to review comments and feedbacks pro-\nvided by other experts in earlier rounds [31]. Further-\nmore, the Delphi technique offers a number of specific\nadvantages and is particularly helpful because it avoids\nthe barriers commonly observed in other group discus-\nsions, such as interpersonal influence, time pressure and\ngroup demands [31,34,35]. This is due to the fact that\nrespondents are not aware of the identities of other\nrespondents and are, therefore, freed of personal and\nsocial constraints [30]. They are also able to complete\nthe Delphi rounds in ways that suit them best because\nthey participate in the rounds asynchronously [36]. The\nDelphi technique is also advantageous because a variety\nof statistical analysis techniques can be used to interpret\nthe data its generates [37].\nThe Delphi process was conducted in three rounds\n[38,39] (Figure 1). Following each step listed in the pre-\nvious figure, our main question was: Which quality\npractices must be included in a quality self-assessment\ntool for PA programmes for the elderly?\nUsing criteria and sub-criteria from the EFQM Excel-\nlence Model [13] and PA guidelines for older adults\n[3,40] as a starting point, we reviewed the literature to\nidentify best practice principles and generate a list of\nstatements. Our review was undertaken using PubMed\n(1980-2010), B-On (1980-2010), and Google ™.W e\nsearched a variety of combinations of key words related\nto PA programmes for the elderly, quality management\nand the EFQM Excellence Model, such as:‘evaluation ’,\n‘guidelines ’, ‘recommendations’ , ‘exercise’ , ‘physical\nMarques et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity2011, 8:104\nhttp://www.ijbnpa.org/content/8/1/104\nPage 2 of 9\nactivity ’, ‘programmes ’, ‘elderly ’, ‘old’, ‘review ’, ‘frame-\nwork’, ‘EFQM’, ‘assess’ and ‘quality’.\nAfter identifying a list of statements, an online ques-\ntionnaire was developed and tested with 5 PA pro-\ngramme coordinators for comments on readability and\nfunctionality. Some adjustments were made to make the\naffirmations included in the questionnaire clearer and\nmore relevant to this case. We established that state-\nments that received greater than 70% of experts’ votes\nhad achieved consensus [41-43] in both the bottom\nscores (i.e., reached consensus to drop) and top scores\n(i.e., reached consensus to include/retain). Statements\nthat were dropped were not included in subsequent\nrounds of ratings. The remaining items were included in\nthe next rounds, until a consensus was achieved to\neither drop or retain. At the end of three rounds, the\nstatements on which experts had not reached consensus\nwere also not included in the output list.\nThe fourth phase of the process involved nominating\nexperts to participate in the Delphi rounds. National\nexperts in research on PA for the elderly, PA pro-\ngrammes for elderly management and delivery, sports\nmanagement, quality management and gerontology were\nidentified. Our decisions were based on expertise or/and\nbreadth of scientific work [44]. The DeGóis Curricula\nPlatform1 assisted us in this process. A list of 63 poten-\ntial participants was generated, along with key contacts\nfor each. This group included 34 PhD scientists and aca-\ndemics (11 in PA for the elderly, 4 in sports manage-\nment, 18 in quality management and 1 in gerontology),\n3 non-PhD academics (1 in PA for the elderly and 2 in\nsports management) and 26 senior technicians (22 in\nPA programmes for elderly management and delivery, 3\nin quality management and 1 in gerontology). Previous\ninformation containing details about the EFQM Excel-\nlence Model, the Delphi process and the purpose of our\nstudy was provided. Of those invited to participate, 5\ndid not respond and 3 declined, due to lack of time (all\nPhD scientists and academics in quality management).\nThus, 55 experts (30 females and 25 males) responded\nto our initial invitation and agreed to participate. Those\nwho accepted our invitation were informed that they\nwere required to respond to three online rounds of\nratings.\nThe rounds were performed using Survey Monkey, a\nweb-based survey and data collection system. In every\nround, participants were asked to rate their level of\nagreement with each proposition, from 1 to 8 (’strongly\ndisagree ’ to ‘strongly agree ’), suggest modifications to\nproposed definitions and/or add propositions that would\nbe useful in a quality self-assessment tool for PA pro-\ngrammes for the elderly. The 8-point Likert scale was\nselected to bring out more variability in responses [45].\nAfter each round, the frequency and mean of the panel’s\nratings and the percentage of scores≥ 7 were calculated.\nBased on this data, a new questionnaire was designed\nand placed online for the next round. We asked partici-\npants to review all the information sent and re-rate each\nstatement.\nAfter round 3, we gathered all our data and developed\na list of statements that did and did not reach\nconsensus.\nResults\nE i g h to ft h e6 3i n v i t e de x p e r t s ,d i dn o tr e s p o n do r\ndeclined. Of the 55 who agreed to participate in this\nprocess, 43 responded to round 1 and were invited to\nparticipate in the subsequent rounds. This group\nincluded 25 females and 18 males and was comprised of\n20 PhD scientists and academics (9 in PA for the\nelderly, 2 in sports management, 8 in quality manage-\nment and 1 in gerontology), 2 non-PhD academics (1 in\nPA for the elderly and 1 in sports management) and 21\nsenior technicians (17 in PA programmes for elderly\nmanagement and delivery, 3 in quality management and\n1 in gerontology). The 12 experts who did not respond\nto round 1 were not involved in subsequent rounds.\nThe results of the three rounds (total number of state-\nments, statements approved by consensus, statements\nwithout consensus, statements modified by experts and\nnew statements proposed by experts) for the nine cri-\nteria are presented in Table 1.\nIn round 1, of the 196 originally-proposed statements\n(best practice principles), the experts modified 41, added\nFigure 1 Steps of the modified Delphi process used in the\npresent study.\nMarques et al.

Of the 41 sug-\ngested modifications, 14 were related to Leadership\n(38,39%), 9 to Policy & strategy (32,14%), 7 to People\n(18,92%), 7 to Processes (14,89%), 1 to Customer results\nand People results (16,67% and 11,11 respectively) and 2\nto Key performance results (50%). Some modifications\nconsisted of minor changes to words or sentence struc-\ntures, while others were about content (e.g., change\n“Higher education qualification, with specialization in\nphysical activity and aging, is required for instructors’/\nteachers ’ programmes” to “Higher education qualifica-\ntion, with specialization in physical activity and aging, or\nrelevant experience in this field, is required for instruc-\ntors’/teachers’ programmes”. The addition was related to\nthe People criterion. Generally, experts made the great-\nest number of suggestions to Leadership and the fewest\n(0 in this case) to Partnership & resources and Society\nresults. The best practice principles that were retained\nwere mostly in Partnership & resources (15 out of 26, i.\ne. 57,69%), Processes (27 out of 47, i.e. 57,45%) and Cus-\ntomer results (3 out of 6, i.e. 50%). The criterion on\nwhich least consensus was reached was Key perfor-\nmance results (1 out of 4, i.e. 25%). No proposition was\ndropped in round 1, i.e. none received greater than 70%\nof the experts’votes in both the bottom scores.\nBased on the results of round 1, 104 propositions were\npresented in round 2. At this stage, experts modified 39\nand achieved consensus on 53 propositions. Most of the\nsuggestions were made on Policy & strategy, Partnership\n& resources and Processes, with none suggestions to\nResults ’ criteria. The best practice principles that were\nretained were mostly in People (14 out of 20, i.e. 70%),\nLeadership (14 out of 23, i.e. 60,87%) and Processes (12\nout of 20, i.e. 60%). The criterion on which there was\nleast consensus was Society results, on which there was\nno agreement. Once more, no proposition was dropped.\nForty one of the 43 experts responded to round 2.\nIn the last round, of the 51 statements proposed, the\nexperts achieved consensus on 19, mostly in Policy &\nstrategy (5 out of 11, i.e. 45,45%), Processes (4 out of 8,\ni.e. 50%) and Partnership & resources (4 out of 9, i.e.\n44,44%). After 3 rounds of rating, they had not achieved\nconsensus on 32 propositions. Most of these statements\nwere concerned with Leadership (7, i.e. 21,88%), Policy\n& strategy (6, i.e. 18,75%) and Partnership & resources\n(5, i.e. 15,63%). One expert who had not responded to\nround 2 was willing to participate in round 3; thus, 42\nof the 43 experts responded to round 3.\nAdditional file 1 presents the resulting tool - named\nQ-STEPS (Quality Self-assessment Tool for Exercise\nProgrammes for Seniors) - which consists of 165 state-\nments that assess nine areas involved in the develop-\nment of PA programmes for the elderly. Five criteria\nassess Enablers (Leadership, Policy & strategy, People,\nPartnership & resources, and Processes) and four criteria\nassess the Results (Customer results, People results,\nSociety results, and Key performance results).\nDiscussion\nThe main goal of this study was to describe the develop-\nment of a quality self-assessment tool for PA pro-\ngrammes for the elderly. To the best of our knowledge,\nno previous studies have sought expert opinions on PA\nfor the elderly, PA programmes for elderly management\nand delivery, sports management, quality management\nand gerontology, with the aim of identifying practices\nthat must be observed when assessing the quality of\nsuch programmes.\nAlthough there are recommendations and guidelines\nfor promoting the physical activity of older people [3,40]\nand recommendations about the need to evaluate these\ninterventions [14,46], the literature is scarce [47], if not\nabsent, on how to integrate these recommendations into\nPA programmes. No framework or tool has yet been\ndeveloped to identify or influence the enablers and out-\ncomes of PA programmes for the elderly.\nThe 43 national experts who participated in the Del-\nphi process were quite engaged throughout, as evi-\ndenced by the number of their suggestions (one\naddition and 53 modifications) and the greater than 97%\nresponse rate to all three rounds of ratings. Most of\ntheir suggestions pertained to Leadership ,w h i l et h e y\nmade no suggestions on Society results .W ep r e s u m e\nthat these results are related to the fact that many\nexperts are programme leaders and thus, are more\naware of practices that pertain to Leadership. Also,\nexperts may have been aware of the fact that Leadership\nis understood by some authors [48-50] as the key to\ndriving quality improvemen t. Our data indicate a high\ndegree of consensus on the retention of all propositions\nconcerning the development of vision and mission and\nthe enhancement of a culture of communication by pro-\ngramme coordinators. These are considered fundamen-\ntal to quality management [51-53], since the physical\npresence of leaders - their visibility and concern for\nquality improvement - are associated with transforma-\ntional leadership [54], i.e. leadership that creates valu-\nable and positive change in its followers. Of the seven\nstatements on Leadership on which experts did not\nachieve consensus, five belong to the sub-criteria that\nconcern the interaction of programme coordinators with\npoliticians, customers, partn ers and representatives of\nsociety. While our study revealed that most of the state-\nments concerning interaction with customers, partners\nand representatives of society achieved consensus, pro-\npositions concerning relationships with politicians or\npolitical affairs did not achieve consensus. This may be\nMarques et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity2011, 8:104\nhttp://www.ijbnpa.org/content/8/1/104\nPage 5 of 9\nrelated to popular negative perceptions of the political\nclass [55]. Examples of statements that touched on the\nrelationship between leade rship and politics include\n“The coordinator manages relations with politicians and\nother stakeholders to ensure shared responsibility” and\n“The coordinator interacts regularly and proactively\nwith policy makers from relevant executive areas (e.g.\nAlderman of Sport) ”. The British Heart Foundation\n(BHF) has stated that participants or other stakeholders\nmust be actively involved in all aspects of programme\ndevelopment, including planning, promotion and evalua-\ntion [40]. The ACSM also recognizes that PA leaders\nshould work closely with individuals to design PA regi-\nmens that reflect personal preferences and capabilities\n[56].\nLeaders unanimously agreed to retain statements\nabout the importance of leaders identifying and cham-\npioning organizational change. Fostering change is\nincreasingly seen as part of a leader’s role [57], and the\nEFQM Fundamental Concepts upon which the Model is\nbased [58] include standard recommendations such as\nplanning change, communicating reasons for it, enabling\npeople to manage change and reviewing the effective-\nness of change.\nExperts also suggested modifications to about 30% of\nthe original propositions on Policy & strategy .Ah i g h\ndegree of consensus was achieved on the retention of all\npropositions concerning the development, review and\nupdating of policy and strategy.\nThe statement that received the greatest degree of\nconsensus was related to the development of annual\nreports. Data from such reports helps improve the\nannual planning cycles of PA programmes. These proce-\ndures are in agreement with those found in other stu-\ndies [59,60] or with different documents, such as those\nthat outline the planning and evaluation of PA pro-\ngrammes [61,62] and health promotion programmes\n[63].\nThroughout the Delphi process, it was suggested that\nthe proposition “The programme involves a multidisci-\nplinary team of professionals ” be added to the People\ncriterion. In fact, the teams that run PA programmes for\nseniors should include not only exercise and sports pro-\nfessionals, but general practitioners, practice nurses and\ncare and residential managers [40]. Of the propositions\non the planning, management and improvement of\nhuman resources that the experts agreed to retain, the\none on which there was greatest consensus was\n“Emphasis is placed on recruiting employees whose pro-\nfile matches the needs of the programme”. The Physical\nActivity and Health Branch (PAHB) of the CDC has\nestablished that PA programmes should be run by\nhighly-skilled PA practitioners [14]. TheCross-National\nExpert Survey Report on Physical Activity Programmes\nand Physical Activity Promotion Strategies for Older Peo-\nple [64] also notes the importance of recruiting teachers\nwho are highly qualified and reinforces the importance\nof continuous professional development.\nDuring the first round, a high level of consensus was\nimmediately reached on propositions related to the\nmanagement of finances and maintenance of facilities,\nequipment and materials (Partnership & resourcescriter-\nion). The management of financial resources is key to\nconsolidating programmes’ financial structure and\nensuring that programmes can fulfil their missions in\nthe present and the future, as well as periodically pro-\nvide maintenance plans for equipment and buildings\n[65,66]. Experts did not achieve consensus on half the\npropositions concerning “external partnerships ”,\nalthough the development and sustainment of commu-\nnity partnerships is the first public health benchmark\nfor PA programmes established by the PAHB [14]. Parti-\ncularly with regards to PA programmes for the elderly,\nsome organizations have reinforced the importance and\nstrength of these partnerships, which provide additional\nresources in the form of funding, facilities and equip-\nment, as well as access to wide-ranging abilities and\nknowledge [40,67]. Indeed, one of the propositions that\ndid not reach consensus was the one that pointed the\nparticipation in networks in order to exchange knowl-\nedge and to improve relationships. However, of the pro-\npositions on which experts did not achieve consensus,\nmost were similar to other statements that were\nretained. Examples include: “Appropriate partnership\nagreements are established, defining roles, responsibil-\nities and expected outcomes” and “Regular and formal\ncommunication procedures are established with\npartners”.\nConsensus was not reached on only four of the 47\nstatements about Processes. Once more, most were simi-\nlar to other statements that were retained. For example,\n“Market research is used to determine the needs and\nexpectations of future customers”– a proposition that\nonly received 64,29% of votes equal to or greater than 7\n– is comparable to“Surveys and other ways of obtaining\nfeedback are used to determine the needs and expecta-\ntions of current and future customers”, a retained pro-\nposition. Physical activity leaders should work closely\nwi\nth individuals to design PA regimens that reflect per-\nsonal preferences and capabilities [56]. The BHF recom-\nmends that participants should be involved in this\nprocess [40]. Moreover, tailoring exercise programmes\nto the needs and interests of participants has been asso-\nciated with higher programme attendance [68,69].\nConcerning the four Results’ criteria, the highest level\nof consensus was achieved on Customer results ,i n\nwhich all propositions were accepted. Indeed, organiza-\ntions must measure and achieve customer results [13].\nMarques et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity2011, 8:104\nhttp://www.ijbnpa.org/content/8/1/104\nPage 6 of 9\nSimilarly, both the processes by which PA interventions\nare conducted and the outcomes of such interventions\nshould be evaluated [47]. The experts achieved a high\ndegree of consensus on all propositions related to client\nassessment, i.e. customer satisfaction, customer loyalty,\ncommunication, complaints handling and management\nand outcomes (physical fitness evaluations and psycho-\nlogical/mental evaluations). By contrast, they displayed\nrelatively little consensus on the criterionPeople results\n(4 out of 9). In fact, the experts were unable to reach\nconsensus on whether or no t to retain propositions\nrelated to employee involvement, motivation, initiative\nand loyalty. However, it should be emphasised that simi-\nlar statements were retained. Examples include: “The\nprogramme has measures of perception and/or perfor-\nmance indicators regarding employees ’ performance ”\nand “The programme has measures of perception and/\nor performance indicators regarding employees’ involve-\nment in teamwork”. In actuality, to achieve excellence,\norganisations must also focus on People results [13],\nsince employee involvement is one of the most impor-\ntant drivers of continuous improvement [58]. Further-\nmore, without satisfied and motivated employees, it is\nimpossible to create satisfied and loyal customers [70].\nThe tool that resulted from this process provides a\nframework tailored to evaluating PA programmes for\nthe elderly, applicable to a variety of settings, namely\ncommunity-based programmes and/or those developed\nby the Public Local Administration. The information\nobtained through such evaluations would be useful for\norganizations seeking to improve their services. It would\nhelp them guide interventions toward excellence, in\norder to improve customer satisfaction and adherence\nto PA programmes targeting the ageing population.\nStrengths and Limitations\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\ngather expert opinions with the aim of identifying prac-\ntices that must be observed when assessing the quality\nof PA programmes for the elderly. Because of the het-\nerogeneity of their interests, panel members were able\nto cover a broad range of topics. In addition, they were\nable to submit comments on each sub-criterion in every\nround, enabling us to use their expertise to develop or\nmodify new statements. This also guaranteed that the\nprocess did not neglect to include any pertinent issues\nin subsequent rounds of rating.\nHowever, this study has certain limitations. Our\nresults should not be interpreted as representing the\nviews of all experts in the field of quality management,\nphysical activity for older adults or gerontology, due to\nthe process used to collect the sample. It is also impor-\ntant to note that the tool suggested by our consensus\nprocess may not be applicable to certain PA\nprogrammes, including those for special population sub-\ngroups, such as: the most elderly, the frail, older adults\nwith chronic illnesses or varying degrees of medical co-\nmorbidity. Likewise, our consensus-informed quality\npractices do not reflect possible differences in PA pro-\ngrammes that were developed in institutional elderly\ncare settings. Additional research is necessary to provide\nthe feasibility analysis of this assessment and to adapt\nand replicate our tool to other circumstances.\nConclusion\nOur Delphi process identified 165 quality practices that\n43 experts consider essential to assessments of the qual-\nity of PA programmes for the elderly. The Q-STEPS\n(Quality Self-assessment Tool for Exercise Programmes\nfor Seniors) tool assesses nine areas involved in the\ndevelopment of PA programmes for the elderly: five cri-\nteria assess Enablers (Leadership, Policy & strategy, Peo-\nple, Partnership & resources, and Processes) and four\ncriteria assess the Results (Customer results, People\nresults, Society results, and Key performance results).\nEthics approval\nThe study was approved by the Scientific Council and\nEthics Committee of the Faculty of Sport - University of\nPorto.\nEndnotes\n1 It is an instrument for gathering, supplying and ana-\nlyze the intellectual and scientific production of the Por-\ntuguese researchers.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Q-STEPS (Quality Self-assessment Tool for Exercise\nProgrammes for Seniors). the file presents the resulting tool - named\nQ-STEPS - which consists of 165 statements that assess nine areas\ninvolved in the development of PA programmes for the elderly.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank all the panel members for their time and\ncontributions to this research.
