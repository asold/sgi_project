It\nhas a promising application prospects in many fields, such\nas language-based man-machine interaction. Unlike the con-\nventional semantic and instance segmentation tasks, referring\n∗Corresponding Authors: Lanfen Lin (llf@zju.edu.cn), Yen-Wei\nChen (chen@is.ritsumei.ac.jp).\nVision Feature Extraction\nCross-Modal Fusion\nDecoder\nCross-Scale Enhancement\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑙 input\n𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐input\n(a) (b)\n(c)\nEncoder\nFigure 1: Comparison of existing Transformer-based architectures\n((a) and (b)) for referring segmentation with our SLViT (c).\nsegmentation task requires precise perception of the loca-\ntions of different objects in an image, making global visual-\nlinguistic relationships modeling indispensable. Moreover,\neffective edge detection of the target objects requires details\nof the image, necessitating high-quality local visual features.\nIn contrast to linear fusion methods [Hu et al., 2016;\nLiu et al., 2017 ] adopting Fully Convolutional Networks\n(FCN) for feature learning and prediction, various attention\nmechanisms [Shi et al., 2018; Ye et al., 2019] have been pro-\nposed to learn rich visual-linguistic information. Transform-\ners can naturally model long-distance dependencies via atten-\ntion mechanisms, which are well suited to cross-modal fusion\nand hence an appropriate choice for referring segmentation\ntask. Therefore, several Vision Transformer (ViT) [Dosovit-\nskiy et al., 2020] methods have been put forth which signif-\nicantly improve performance for this task. Figure 1(a) il-\nlustrates a Transformer-based architecture for referring im-\nage segmentation, i.e., VLT [Ding et al., 2021], which fuses\nvision and language features after vision feature extraction\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n1294\n“ the first half of  . \nthe sandwich to the left ”\n“ top left bowl ”\n(c) SLViT (w/o URCE) (d) SLViT(b) LAVT(a) VLT\n(g) SLViT (w/o URCE) (h) SLViT(f) LAVT(e) VLT\nGround Truth\nGround Truth\nFigure 2: Qualitative results of different approaches. The prediction masks for the image with the referring text“the first half of the sandwich\nto the left” and “top left bowl” are shown in (a)-(d) and (e)-(h), respectively.\nthrough encoders. The architecture shown in Fig.1(b) is em-\nployed in EFN [Feng et al., 2021 ] and LA VT[Yang et al.,\n2022]. This architecture includes a fusion module at the end\nof each stage to fuse extracted visual features with linguistic\nmodality information. The existing Transformer-based de-\nsigns take advantage of long-range dependencies and hier-\narchical structure to enhance performance, although Trans-\nformer designs can be further improved. Specifically, visual\nfeature extraction and cross-modal fusion are considered into\ntwo independent steps in the existing works, which leaves\nroom for improvement in visual-linguistic alignment in se-\nmantic space. Additionally, current approaches adopt se-\nquential structures that result in single-scale representations\nat each level, despite the fact that multi-scale feature interac-\ntion has been shown to be more beneficial for capturing the\ncore semantic information.\nBy revisiting previous successful works and analyzing re-\nquirements of the referring segmentation task, we argue a ef-\nfective method for such task should have the following char-\nacteristics: (i) A robust fusion encoder network to capture\nlocal visual and global visual-linguistic information. To ac-\ncurately pinpoint the target instance with varying character-\nistics, both rich local visual features and positional global\ncross-modal relationships are crucial. (ii) Multi-scale infor-\nmation interaction to capture cross-scale dependencies and\naddress complex scale differences. For dense prediction\ntasks like referring segmentation, the incorporation of com-\nplementing information from multiple scales is helpful.\nTherefore, taking the aforementioned analysis into ac-\ncount, we propose a novel referring image segmentation ar-\nchitecture (in Figure 1(c)), namely Scale-Wise Language-\nGuided Vision Transformer (SLViT). In SLViT, we propose\nan integrated vision-language encoder network design, with\na novel attention mechanism called Language-Guided Multi-\nScale Fusion Attention (LMFA) to comprehensively extract\nmulti-scale local visual features and model global cross-\nmodal relationships. It improves visual-linguistic alignment\nin semantic space in a lightweight manner. As shown in\nFigure 2(a)-(c), LMFA significantly improves performance\nin locating objects. Considering the spatial correlation be-\ntween patches at different scales through downsampling, it\nis beneficial to perform interactions at different scales of the\nsame region for feature refinement. Furthermore, there are\nregions where the semantic information is temporarily uncer-\ntain, making targeted cross-scale enhancement needed. We\ndesign a cross-scale feature fusing module named Uncertain\nRegion Cross-Scale Enhancement (URCE) to identify regions\nof high uncertainty, represented by variance of cross-modal\nattention scores between scales, and then refine features of\nthe regions using complementary information from multiple\nscales. The accuracy of boundary identification is improved\nby URCE, which is qualitatively shown in Figure 2(e)-(h).\nIn summary, our contributions are three-folded:\n1. We propose Language-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion At-\ntention (LMFA) module in our integrated vision-\nlanguage encoder with the ability of integrated local vi-\nsual feature extraction and global cross-modal relation-\nships modeling in referring segmentation. LMFA im-\nproves visual-linguistic alignment in semantic space.\n2. We design a multi-scale feature fusion module named\nUncertain Region Cross-Scale Enhancement (URCE).\nURCE uses the variance of cross-modal correlations be-\ntween adjacent stages to identify regions of high uncer-\ntainty and refines features of these regions with comple-\nmenting information from multiple stages, which helps\nin identifying satisfactory boundaries.\n3. Based on the aforementioned moudules, we design a\nnovel framework named SLViT for referring segmenta-\ntion task. We conducted thorough experiments on SLViT\nwith three benchmark datasets, and the experimental re-\nsults show that SLViT outperforms current state-of-the-\nart methods with lower computational cost.\n2 Related Works\nReferring segmentation.

The Uncertain Region Cross-\nScale Enhancement (URCE) then identifies uncertain regions in the image and enhances patches inFi, i∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} corresponding to them,\nwhich interacts among different scales. Finally, the reinforced features˜Fi, i∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} are sent to the decoder block for final segmentation.\ning to verbal expression. [Hu et al., 2020 ] capture the mu-\ntual guidance between two modalities by a bi-directional re-\nlationship inferring network. [Yu et al., 2018] and [Huang et\nal., 2020] use knowledge about sentence structure to capture\nattributes in cross-modal features, while [Hui et al., 2020 ]\nexploits syntactic structures between words to guide cross-\nmodal context aggregation. Recently, Transformer-based\nmethods have improved the ability to model long-distance\ncross-modal dependencies and made significant progress in\nreferring segmentation. A VLT framework with encoder-\ndecoder is proposed in [Ding et al., 2021 ] using attention\nmechanism to enhance global context information. In EFN\n[Feng et al., 2021 ], a collaborative attention mechanism is\npresented to gradually refine multi-modal features using lan-\nguage and promote cross-modal expression. LA VT [Yang et\nal., 2022 ] achieves the early fusion of linguistic and visual\nfeatures between encoders of ViT.\nVision transformer and multi-scale architecture. Trans-\nformer models have been widely used for several computer\nvision tasks. The ViT model applies self-attention in shal-\nlow layers enhancing performance for vision tasks. Since\nthe computational complexity of self-attention is a quadratic\npolynomial in the number of tokens, it is difficult to di-\nrectly apply it to a large number of tokens. Therefore,\nin order to improve the performance of fine-grained tasks\nsuch as segmentation, various attention mechanisms have\nbeen developed in some recent works [Liu et al., 2021b;\nRen et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2022 ]\nto reduce computational cost while retaining valuable vi-\nsual information. Various studies [Zheng et al., 2021;\nGu et al., 2022 ] using Transformer with multi-scale designs\nfor segmentation tasks have been presented using knowl-\nedge between different scales. For referring segmentation\ntask, many Transformer-based methods [Ding et al., 2021;\nFeng et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2022 ] exploiting sequential\nstructures have been proposed. These methods leverage se-\nquential structures and lack sufficient multi-scale interaction.\n3 Scale-Wise Language-Guided Vision\nTransformer\n3.1 Overview\nThe proposed SLViT learns local visual and global visual-\nlinguistic cues within scales in an integrated way as well as\nmodeling inter-scale dependencies of uncertain regions. The\nstructure of SLViT is shown in Figure 3.\nIn a hierarchical manner, we propose the [integrated\nvision-language encoder] - [cross-scale enhancement] - de-\ncoder framework. The encoder (Sec.3.2) includes a novel\nlightweight attention module (Sec.3.3) that uses simultaneous\nmulti-scale convolutional operations and gated cross-modal\nattention to capture local visual features and global visual-\nlinguistic correlations. We also propose to use variance be-\ntween adjacent stages of cross-modal correlation to assess the\nuncertainty of regions in the image. For regions of high un-\ncertainty, we design a novel cross-scale feature fusion module\n(Sec.3.4) to automatically refine mutual regions at different\nscales via the complementary information among them. Fi-\nnally, the enhanced representations are sent to the decoder\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n1296\nblock (Sec.3.5) for the final prediction. In the following sub-\nsections, we describe each components of SLViT in detail.\n3.2 Integrated Vision-Language Encoder\nIn order to improve the alignment of visual-linguistic features\nin semantic space, we propose an integrated vision-language\nencoder to capture visual and cross-modal features in an in-\ntegrated way. The block structure of our encoder follows\nthe design of ViT [Dosovitskiy et al., 2020 ] but we design\na novel attention mechanism (Sec.3.3) replacing the conven-\ntional self-attention mechanism.\nAs shown in Figure 3(a), our encoder has a pyramid struc-\nture, which contains 4 stages with decreasing spatial reso-\nlutions. There are Ni blocks in our encoder for i-th stage.\nGiven input of a pair of an image and a referring expression,\nour model outputs a segmentation mask for the specified in-\nstance. We extract language features via a language encoder\nBERT [Devlin et al., 2018 ]. The language feature provided\ninto encoders are denoted as L ∈ RCl×T , where Cl is the\nnumber of channel, T is the number of words. The given\nimage passes through an embedding block to obtain initial\nvision input V1 ∈ RCv1×H1×W1 of the encoder, where Cv1 is\nthe number of channels, H1 and W1 are height and width of\nthe feature maps in first stage. Each stage contains a down-\nsampling block and a stack of integrated vision-language en-\ncoders. The down-sampling block consists of a convolution\nwith stride of 2 and kernel size of 3 × 3, followed by a batch\nnormalization layer. For each stage, the stack of integrated\ncross-modal feature maps Fi can be represented as:\nFi =\n\u001aIlve(V1, L), i = 1\nIlve(Down(Fi−1), L), i = 2,3, 4 (1)\nwhere function Down(·) indicates the down-sampling block,\nfunction Ilve(·) indicates blocks in our encoder to catch in-\ntegrated cross-modal features, i indexes the stage. We obtain\nthe visual inputs of stages 2, 3, 4 through Vi = Down(Fi−1).\n3.3 Language-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion\nAttention\nAs depicted in Figure 3(b), our proposed attention mecha-\nnism, namely Language-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion Atten-\ntion (LMFA), contains four parts: a convolution operation\nto capture preliminary local feature, a multi-scale convolu-\ntional activation to aggregate multi-scale local visual features,\na gated cross-modal activation to aggregate global visual-\nlinguistic relationships, and a 1 × 1 convolution operation to\nmodel relationships between branches. In i-th stage, given\nthe visual input Vi ∈ RCvi×Hi×Wi and the linguistic input\nL ∈ RCl×T , we obtain the preliminary local visual feature\nmap V Local\ni employing a 5 × 5 convolution operation.\nMulti-scale convolutional activation. There are three con-\ncurrent convolutional branches with different kernel sizes\nto capture local features of different receptive fields, which\nhas spatial inductive-bias in modelling rich local visual in-\nformation. Multi-scale convolutional activation Attconv\ni ∈\nRCvi×Hi×Wi can be obtained using the following equation:\nAttconv\ni =\n3X\nt=1\nConvt\nR(Convt\nC(V Local\ni )), (2)\nwhere t indexes the convolutional branch, Convt\nR indicates\na 1 × kt convolution function for horizontal linear features,\nConvt\nC indicates a kt × 1 convolution function for vertical\nlinear features. The strip-like convolution kernels aims in ob-\ntaining detailed local visual information with low cost.\nGated cross-modal activation. We utilize a gated cross-\nmodal attention to model global visual-linguistic relation-\nships. The steps to get gated cross-modal activation\nAttcross\ni ∈ RCvi×Hi×Wi are described as follows:\nViq = flatten(ωiq(Vi)), (3)\nLik, Liv = ωik(L), ωiv(L), (4)\nSi = V T\niq Lik, (5)\nAttcross\ni = Gate(unflatten(softmax( Si\n√Cl\n)LT\niv)), (6)\nwhere ωiq, ωik, ωiv are projection functions, Gate(·) indi-\ncates a 1×1 convolution and a GELU function, flatten(·)\nmeans unrolling the two spatial dimensions into one dimen-\nsion in row-major, and unflatten(·) indicates the opposite\noperation. Here, Si ∈ RHiWi×T is the attention scores be-\ntween the Viq and Lik, which represents the degree of corre-\nlation between two modalities. In the last block of each stage,\nSi is provided to URCE. ωiq is implemented as a 1×1 convo-\nlution followed by instance normalization with Cvi number\nof output channels. Each of ωik and ωiv is implemented as a\n1 × 1 convolution with Cvi number of output channels.\nIntegrated attention. We apply a convolution to coordi-\nnate convolutional branches and the cross-modal branch ob-\ntaining integrated attention weights and reweight the inputVi\nof LMFA. We obtain the integrated cross-modal feature map\nFi ∈ RCvi×Hi×Wi using the following equation:\nFi = Conv1×1(Attconv\ni + Attcross\ni + V Local\ni ) ⊙ Vi, (7)\nwhere ⊙ is element-wise matrix multiplication operation, and\nConv1×1 indicates a 1×1 convolution function to model rela-\ntionships between branches.\n3.4 Uncertain Region Cross-Scale Enhancement\nMulti-scale information is crucial for capturing boundary de-\ntails. To optimize spatial correspondence and minimize re-\ndundancy, we propose an Uncertain Region Cross-Scale En-\nhancement (URCE) module. URCE targets high-uncertainty\nregions and facilitates interaction across scales within our hi-\nerarchical model. Refer to Figure 3(c) for the URCE pipeline.\nUncertain region extraction.

We select K most uncertain regions to utilize\ncross-scale enhancement. The steps are described as follows:\nmapU =\n4X\ni=2\n|Down(Ri) − Down(Ri−1)|, (8)\nIndex = TopK (mapU ), (9)\nwhere mapU ∈ Hv4Wv4 means uncertainty map of each co-\nordinate, which is obtained by the correlation difference be-\ntween adjacent stages. Here, Down(·) indicates function to\ndownsample Ri into size of feature maps of 4-th stage, and\nTopK (·) indicates the function to find the array index of un-\ncertain regions with largest K values in the array mapU .\nThe K uncertain regions marked by Index, which corre-\nspond to patches in different scales, are first rearranged into\n2D tensor. Let pj\ni denotes the patch of j-th uncertain region\nin i-th stage. As an example of K = 2, Figure 4(b) illustrates\nthe process of finding the target patches in three successive\nfeature maps Fi, Fi+1, Fi+2 from i-th to (i+2)-th stage with\nsample inputs (in Figure 4(a)).\nCross-scale fusing attention. We model cross-scale clues\nfor uncertain patches correlated spatially, as shown in Figure\n4(c). For j-th uncertain region, patches from multiple stages\nare passed through Channel Unify to have the same channel\ndimension Cf . Then we concatenate them to obtain cross-\nscale feature Pj\ncross corresponding to j-th uncertain region,\nwhich can be described as follows:\nConcat[ωp(pj\n1), ωp(pj\n2), ωp(pj\n3), ωp(pj\n4)] − →Pj\ncross, (10)\nwhere pj\ni ∈ 2iCv × h\n2i\nw\n2i is the feature map of j-th uncertain\npatch in i-th stage, h and w are size of patches in first stage,\nand ωp indicates functions to unify the channel to Cf and to\nrearrange the feature map into 2D tensor. Then we model\ncross-scale dependencies as follows:\n˜Pj\ncross = MSA(LN (Pj\ncross)) +Pj\ncross, (11)\nwhere LN(·) indicates the layer normalization operator, and\nMSA(·) indicates multi-head self-attention. Then we reverse\nthe enhanced sequence back to patches according to the order\nof concatenation:\nωreverse\np (Split( ˜Pj\ncross)) − →˜pj\n1, ˜pj\n2, ˜pj\n3, ˜pj\n4, (12)\nwhere ωreverse\np indicates Channel Reverse. Here, ωreverse\np\nand Split(·) are inverse operations of previous operations ωp\nand Concat[·], respectively. Then we employ Uncertain Re-\ngion Restore that replaces pj\ni with ˜pj\ni to obtain final cross-\nmodal feature maps ˜Fi for each stage.\n3.5 Decoder and Segmentation\nAfter cross-scale enhancement, a decoder network is em-\nployed to capture high-level semantics. We aggregate fea-\ntures ˜F1, ˜F2, ˜F3, ˜F4 from URCE and use a lightweight Ham-\nburger [Geng et al., 2021] to further model the global context.\nWe obtain the final prediction results by the following equa-\ntion:\nOut = Seg(Ham(Concat[ ˜F1, ˜F2, ˜F3, ˜F4])), (13)\nwhere Fi is the cross-modal feature maps from stages,\nHam(·) indicates a Hamburger function, and Seg(·) indi-\ncates a 1×1 convolution and an upsampling function for final\nprediction.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Dataset and Evaluation\nWe perform experiments on three widely used benchmark\ndatasets for referring image segmentation, including Ref-\nCOCO [Yu et al., 2016 ], RefCOCO+ [Yu et al., 2016 ], and\nG-Ref [Mao et al., 2016; Nagaraja et al., 2016 ]. They have\n19,994, 19,992, and 26,711 images respectively, containing\n50,000, 49,856, and 54,822 references and 142,209, 141,564,\nand 104,560 reference expressions.\nFollowing previous works [Wang et al., 2022; Yang et\nal., 2022 ], we evaluate our proposed method with overall\nintersection-over-union (oIoU), mean intersection-over-union\n(mIoU), and precision at various thresholds. The oIoU is the\nratio between the total intersection area and the total union\nareas. Precision refers to the proportion of test samples with\nIoU values higher than the threshold.\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n1298\nMethod Language RefCOCO RefCOCO+ G-Ref\nModel val test A\ntest B val te st\nA test B val(U) test(U) v\nal(G)\nMAttNet [Yu et al.,\n2018] Bi-LSTM 56.51 62.37 51.70 46.67 52.39 40.08 47.64 48.61 -\nCMSA [Ye et\nal., 2019] None 58.32 60.61 55.09 43.76 47.60 37.89 - - 39.98\nCAC [Chen et\nal., 2019b] Bi-LSTM 58.90 61.77 53.81 - - - 46.37 46.95 44.32\nSTEP [Chen et al.\n, 2019a] Bi-LSTM 60.04 63.46 57.97 48.19 52.33 40.41 - - 46.40\nBRINet [Hu et al.\n, 2020] LSTM 60.98 62.99 59.21 48.17 52.32 42.11 - - 48.04\nLSCM [Hui et al.\n, 2020] LSTM 61.47 64.99 59.55 49.34 42.12 43.50 - - 48.05\nCMPC+ [Liu et al.\n, 2021a] LSTM 62.47 65.08 60.82 50.25 54.04 43.47 - - 49.89\nMCN [Luo et al.\n, 2020b] Bi-GRU 62.44 64.20 59.71 50.62 54.99 44.69 49.22 49.40 -\nEFN [Feng et al.\n, 2021] Bi-GRU 62.76 65.69 59.67 51.50 55.24 43.01 - - 51.93\nBUSNet [Y\nang et al., 2021] Self-Att 63.27 66.41 61.39 51.76 56.87 44.13 - - 50.56\nCGAN [Luo et al.\n, 2020a] Bi-GRU 64.86 68.04 62.07 51.03 55.51 44.06 51.01 51.69 46.54\nISFP [Liu et al.\n, 2022] Bi-GRU 65.19 68.45 62.73 52.70 56.77 46.39 52.67 53.00 50.08\nLTS [Jing et\nal., 2021] Bi-GRU 65.43 67.76 63.08 54.21 58.32 48.02 54.40 54.25 -\nVLT [Ding et\nal., 2021] Bi-GRU 65.65 68.29 62.73 55.50 59.20 49.36 52.99 56.65 49.76\nReSTR [Kim et al.\n, 2022] Transformer 67.22 69.30 64.45 55.78 60.44 48.27 54.48 - -\nCRIS [Wang et\nal., 2022] Transformer 70.47 73.18 66.10 62.27 68.08 53.68 59.87 60.36 -\nLAVT [Y\nang et al., 2022] BERT 72.73 75.82 68.79 62.14 68.38 55.10 61.24 62.09 60.50\nOurs (w/o URCE) BERT 73.34 75.98 70.21 63.72 68.81 55.72 62.74 63.23 60.55\nOurs BERT 74.02 76.91 70.62 64.07 69.28 56.14 62.75 63.57 60.94\nTable 1: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall IoU on three benchmark datasets.

Convolutions in LMFA’s convolu-\ntional branches and our decoder are initialized with weights\npre-trained on ImageNet-22K from the SegNeXt [Guo et al.,\n2022]. Language encoder of our model is initialized using\nofficial pre-trained weights of BERT with 12 layers and hid-\nden size 768. In convolutional branches of LMFA, we use\nk1 = 7, k2 = 11, k3 = 21kernel sizes for our convolutions.\nThe rest of weights in our model are randomly initialized.\nFollowing, we use AdamW optimizer with weight decay\n0.01. The learning rate is initialed as 3e-5 and scheduled by\npolynomial learning rate decay with a power of 0.9. All the\nmodels are trained for60 epochs with a batch size of16. Each\nreference has 2-3 sentences on average, and we randomly\nsample one referring expression per object in a epoch. Im-\nage size is adjusted to 480 × 480 without data augmentation.\n4.3 Comparison with the State-of-the-Arts\nWe compare the performance of our proposed method with\nstate-of-the-art methods on three widely-used datasets using\nthe oIoU metric. Experimental results are reported in Table 1\nand the best results are highlighted in bold. As shown, our\nSLViT without Uncertain Region Cross-Scale Enhancement\n(w/o URCE) outperforms all other methods. This has an im-\nprovement of 1.58 oIoU over the Val Split set of the Ref-\nCOCO+ dataset, while on average an improvement of 0.83\noIoU across all 9 validation sets of the three datasets.

We explore the\nnumber of uncertain regionsK to utilize cross-scale enhance-\nment. In Figure 5(a), when increasing the number of selected\nuncertain regions, the oIoU metrics increase sharply at the be-\nginning and then tends to stabilize. The increase in the value\nof K is linearly correlated with the increasement of comput-\ning cost. We choose K = 32as the default setting.\nEffectiveness of URCE. To verify the performance of\nURCE, we have compared SLViT to SLViT (w/o URCE) in\nTable 2(c). It shows this ablation leads to a drop of 0.68 and\n0.67 absolute point in overall IoU and mean IoU respectively,\nand a drop of an average of 2.18 points in precision across the\nthree thresholds. In addition, Ours and Ours (w/o URCE) in\nFigure 5(b) also show that URCE improves performance with\na slight increase in parameters and GFLOPs.\nAblation of URCE on various stages. Given integrated\ncross-modal features from different stages, URCE forms cor-\nresponding regions of them into a sequence for joint refine-\nment in single forward pass.

We con-\nduct several experiments to assess the influence of the de-\ncoder with various sequences as input. As shown in Ta-\nble 2(e), features ˜F1, ˜F2, ˜F3, ˜F4 , which are enhanced by\nURCE, are the best choices to be sent to the decoder network.\n4.5 Interpretation of SLViT\nIn Figure 6, we visualize the feature maps from LA VT[Yang\net al., 2022], our SLViT (w/o URCE) and SLViT. Comparing\nF1, F2, F3, F4 from our SLViT (w/o URCE) toY1, Y2, Y3, Y4\nfrom LA VT’s various stages, the feature mapsF1 to F4 grad-\nually focus on the target instance and show more visual-\nlinguistic alignment in semantic space as stages go deeper.\nIt indicates that in LMFA, multi-scale convolutional activa-\ntion learns valuable local visual information, and gated cross-\nmodal activation is useful in identifying the relative position\nof the target object. We interpret the role of URCE by com-\nparing the segmentation results and the feature maps Fi, ˜Fi.\nImpressively in F2 and ˜F2, the fence as the background in ˜F2\nhas been eliminated, which indicates that URCE is able to fil-\nter out irrelevant objects. As F3 and ˜F3 are being observed,\nthe edge of the target object in ˜F3 is more concerned. There-\nfore, URCE can eliminate interference items and improve the\naccuracy of boundary prediction by cross-scale enhancement\nof uncertain regions.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based frame-\nwork named SLViT for referring image segmentation. SLViT\ncaptures rich local visual features and models global visual-\nlinguistic relationships in an integrated manner at each stage.\nThe proposed network design interacts cross-modal features\nof uncertain regions between different scales with spatial cor-\nrespondence. Experiments show that SLViT outperforms ex-\nisting methods on three benchmark datasets with lower com-\nputational cost.\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n1300\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the National Key Re-\nsearch and Development Project (No. 2022YFC2504605),\nZhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China\n(No. LZ22F020012), Major Technological Innovation Project\nof Hangzhou (No. 2022AIZD0147), Major Scientific Re-\nsearch Project of Zhejiang Lab (No. 2020ND8AD01).\nReferences\n[Chen et al., 2019a] Ding-Jie Chen, Songhao Jia, Yi-Chen\nLo, Hwann-Tzong Chen, and Tyng-Luh Liu.
