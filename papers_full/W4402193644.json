    "abstract": "With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the road, minor traffic accidents have become more frequent, contributing significantly to traffic congestion and disruptions. Traditional methods for determining responsibility in such accidents often require human intervention, leading to delays and inefficiencies. This study proposed a fully intelligent method for liability determination in minor accidents, utilizing collision detection and large language models. The approach integrated advanced vehicle recognition using the YOLOv8 algorithm coupled with a minimum mean square error filter for real-time target tracking. Additionally, an improved global optical flow estimation algorithm and support vector machines were employed to accurately detect traffic accidents. Key frames from accident scenes were extracted and analyzed using the GPT4-Vision-Preview model to determine liability. Simulation experiments demonstrated that the proposed method accurately and efficiently detected vehicle collisions, rapidly determined liability, and generated detailed accident reports. The method achieved the fully automated AI processing of minor traffic accidents without manual intervention, ensuring both objectivity and fairness.",
