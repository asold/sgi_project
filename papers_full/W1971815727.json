SDB is a common and highly prevalent\ncondition in children (2% among children [1], [2] and 2.5%-6%\namong adolescents [3]) that can cause severe complications if left\nuntreated. Symptoms include snoring, disturbed sleep, daytime\nsleepiness and neurobehavioural problems [4],[5]. SDB includes\nobstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, central sleep apnea\nsyndrome, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and alveolar hypoventila-\ntion syndrome [6]. OSA is the most common type of SDB in\nchildren and is characterized by repeated obstruction of breathing\nduring sleep, which results in oxyhemoglobin desaturation,\nhypercapnia and repeated arousals. Complications due to\nrecurrent hypoxia-reoxygenation episodes during the night,\ninclude neurocognitive impairment, behavioural problems, failure\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e112959\nPSG was attached to the Phone Oximeter to record overnight pulse oximetry (SpO2  and photoplethysmogram (PPG))\nto thrive, and cor pulmonale, particularly in severe cases [7],[8].\nThus, SDB poses a serious threat to the healthy growth and\ndevelopment of many children.\nPolysomnography (PSG), the gold standard to diagnose SDB, is\nthe most commonly used diagnostic technique shown to quantify\nthe ventilatory and sleep abnormalities associated with SDB. This\nnocturnal study is highly resource-intensive [9],[10] and requires a\nspecialized sleep laboratory, expensive equipment and an over-\nnight stay in the facility [6], confining PSG monitoring to\ncentralized specialist facilities. For example, in British Columbia\nall PSG studies in children are performed at the British Columbia\nChildren’s Hospital (BCCH) in Vancouver. This greatly limits\naccess, especially for those who live in remote locations. The\ncapacity to perform PSG at BCCH is limited to fewer than 250\ncases per year, resulting in a waitlist of six months. In recently\ndeveloped clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and\nmanagement of SDB in children and adolescents [4], the\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics concludes that all children/\nadolescents should be screened for snoring and OSA symptoms\n(defined in the guidelines [4],[7]) and PSG should be performed\nonly in those with regular snoring and signs of OSA.\nThe high cost (approximately\n$800 per night in direct health\ncare costs at BCCH) [11] and limited access of PSG have\ngenerated a great interest in alternative techniques to simplify the\nstandard procedure. Already part of the standard PSG, pulse\noximetry is a simple non-invasive method of measuring blood\noxygen saturation (SpO\n2) and recording blood volume changes in\ntissue using the photoplethysmographic signal (PPG). Numerous\ngroups have studied the use of overnight oximetry as a potential\nstandalone method to diagnose SDB. Nixon et al. developed a\nseverity scoring system using overnight oximetry and validated the\nscore as a tool to prioritize adenotonsillectomy surgeries [12],[13].\nA´ lvarez et al. demonstrated that the characterization of overnight\noximetry provided significant information to identify adults\n[14],[15] with significant OSA. Both studies focused on SpO\n2\nalone; however, there are some SDB events that occur in the\nabsence of SpO2 desaturation [16]. It has been reported that SDB\naffects the normal variation of heart rate [17],[18], suggesting that\ncombining SpO 2 and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis\nmight provide a more robust SDB detector. Based on this concept,\nHeneghan et al. proposed a portable, automated OSA assessment\ntool with a Holter-Oximeter [19], [20].\nThe original Phone Oximeter (Figure 1) is a mobile device that\nintegrates a commercially available and Federal Drug Adminis-\ntration (FDA) approved microcontroller-based pulse oximeter\n(Masimo Set uSpO\n2 Pulse Oximetry Cable) with a mobile\nsmartphone [21]. The Phone Oximeter enables the acquisition,\nmonitoring and analysis of vital signs and intuitive display of\ninformation to health care providers. A low cost version of the\nPhone Oximeter that does not require an intermediate micro-\ncontroller was recently developed. This prototype interfaces the\nsensor directly with the phone via the audio jack, reducing the\ntotal cost of the Phone Oximeter to only that of the finger probe\n[22],[23]. In our previous research, we showed that the\nFigure 1. The Phone Oximeter.

We also investigated the influence of SpO 2 resolution\n(0.1%, 1%) on the SpO 2 pattern characterization and demon-\nstrated that it has a great influence in regularity measurements and\ntherefore should be considered when studying SDB [25]. In\naddition, we calculated Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) from the\nPhone Oximeter’s PPG, and compared it with HRV computed\nfrom simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) [26]. In the time\ndomain, PRV provided accurate estimates of HRV, while some\ndifferences were found in the frequency domain. Gil et al. also\nshowed that during non-stationary conditions there are some small\ndifferences between HRV and PRV, mainly in the respiratory\nband, which were related to the pulse transit time variability [27].\nHowever, they also concluded that these differences are sufficiently\nsmall to suggest the use of PRV as an alternative measure of HRV.\nWe also conducted an additional investigation of the effects of\nSDB on PRV during different sleep stages and concluded that the\nmodulation of PRV might be helpful in improving the assessment\nof SDB in children [28]. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to\ncombine both SpO\n2 pattern characterization and PRV analysis to\nidentify children with significant SDB, using the Phone Oximeter.\nWe evaluate the Phone Oximeter’s potential as a stand-alone SDB\nscreening tool to identify children who should undergo a complete\nPSG study, with the eventual goal of reducing costs and hospital\nwaitlists.\nMaterial and Methods\n2.1 Dataset\n2.1.1 Ethics statement. All subjects were recruited accord-\ning to a protocol approved by the University of British Columbia\nand Children’s and Women’s Health Centre of British Columbia\nResearch Ethics Board (H11-01769). Parental/guardian written\ninformed consent was obtained for all subjects, and written assent\nwas obtained for all subjects over the age of 11 years.\n2.1.2 Data acquisition. One hundred and sixty children\nwith signs of sleep apnea (such as snoring, daytime sleepiness,\nbehavioural problems or clinically large tonsils) referred to BCCH\nfor PSG recording were recruited to and participated in this study.\nChildren with cardiac arrhythmia or abnormal hemoglobin were\nexcluded. In addition, fourteen children were excluded from the\nFigure 2. Power spectral density applied to a 2-minute SpO2 signal of (A) a child with, and (B) without SDB.The SDB child shows a clear\nmodulation frequency peak, whereas the NonSDB child illustrates no clear modulation peak.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112959.g002\nScreening Tool for SDB in Children Using the Phone OximeterTM\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e112959\nstudy because the total duration of the sleep time or the collected\nsignals from the PSG or the Phone Oximeter (PPG and SpO 2)\nwere shorter than 3 hours.\nThe data acquisition was carried out in the sleep unit. Standard\nPSG was recorded using the Embla Sandman S4500, specifically\ndesigned to meet the American Academy of Sleep Medicine\n(AASM) accreditation requirements. The PSG included the\novernight measurement of ECG, electroencephalogram (EEG),\nSpO2, chest and abdominal movement, nasal and oral airflow, and\nvideo recordings. The pulse oximeter sensor of the Phone\nOximeter was applied to the finger adjacent to the one used\nduring standard PSG. The SpO 2 (0.1% resolution) and PPG\nsignals, recorded by the Phone Oximeter, were sampled at 1 Hz\nand 62.5 Hz, respectively.\nA sleep technician visually scored the PSG in 30-second epochs\naccording to AASM 2007 standard criteria [29]. Hypnograms\nwere differentiated into stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 (non-REM) and\nrapid eye movement (REM) sleep. According to the standard\ncriteria, obstructive apneas were defined as complete cessation of\nairflow in the presence of respiratory effort lasting §10 seconds.\nHypopneas were defined as a §50% airflow reduction relative to\nthe 2 preceding breaths. Blood oxygen desaturations were defined\nas a §3% decrease in arterial oxygen saturation. When\nrespiratory effort partially or totally ceased, apneas were scored\nas mixed or central sleep apnea, respectively. The number of\napneas/hypopneas was counted hourly to compute the average\napneas/hypopnea index (AHI), which was specified also for REM\nand non-REM (NREM) sleep stages. The total bed time (TBT),\ntotal sleep time (TST) and the percentage of time spent in the\ndifferent sleep stages were also analyzed (Table 1). Pulse oximetry\ndata acquired with the Phone Oximeter and the reference AHI is\nbe publicly available online via doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.1209662.\nThe current clinical protocol at BCCH recommends children\nwith an AHI §5 undergo treatment for SDB. This study therefore\nused an AHI §5 as a positive indication of SDB. The current\ntreatment for SDB at BCCH consists of continuous or bi-level\npositive airway pressure (CPAP or BiPAP) or surgical adenoton-\nsillectomy. Adenotonsillectomy being the most common treatment\nfor pediatric SDB [12],[30].\n2.2 Characterization\nThe proposed algorithm characterizes both the SpO 2 pattern\n[24] and PRV [28], in the time and frequency domains, using a 2-\nminute sliding window, with 1-minute overlap. This characteriza-\ntion was performed offline in Matlab (Mathworks Inc, Natick,\nUSA).\ngreater than 4%, were considered as artifacts and eliminated prior\nto further analysis. The SpO 2 signal analysis was focused on\ncharacterizing modulation generated by the desaturations result-\ning from SDB.\nTime domain features: A number of time domain statistics\nsuch as: mean, median, standard deviation and interquartile range\nof the SpO 2 as well as indices including the number of\ndesaturations from baseline below 2% (n2%), the cumulative time\nspent below 92% (t92%) and the D index (variability measure)\nwere calculated for each time window. In addition, to evaluate the\ncomplexity of the SpO 2 pattern, nonlinear measures such as\nsample entropy (SampEn), approximate entropy (ApEn) and\ncentral tendency measure (CTM) [31], [32] were calculated.\nSpectral domain features:The SpO2 signal was characterized\nin the spectral domain using power spectral density (PSD). To\nprovide better frequency resolution, a parametric PSD was\nperformed approximating the SpO 2 signal through an autore-\ngressive model using:\nSpO2(n)~{\nXp\nk~1\nak:SpO2(n{k)ze(n) ð1Þ\nwhere e(n) denotes zero-mean white noise with variance se2, ak\nthe autoregressive coefficients and p the model order. Once the\nautoregressive coefficients and the variance was estimated, the\nPSD of an autoregressive model was computed by:\nPSD( f )~ se2\nD1z Pp\nk~1\nak:e{j2pfkT D2\nð2Þ\nWith 1/T as the sampling frequency.\nThe selection of model order is a trade-off between the\nfrequency resolution and the presence of spurious peaks. The\noptimum model order was selected according to the minimum\ndescription length criterion from Rissanen [33]. Using the 2-\nminute sliding window, the SpO 2 signal was divided into small\nsegments that can be assumed to be stationary and therefore,\npermit computation of PSD (see Figure 2). The sleep apnea events\nhappen in a pseudo periodic pattern, which modulates the SpO 2\nsignal and provokes a modulation frequency peak at very low\nfrequency band (Figure 3). In addition, this time-varying spectral\nanalysis permitted consideration of the SpO 2 pattern changes in\nthe frequency domain (see Figure 4). Three spectral parameters\nwere extracted from the PSD: 1) the power (P) within the\nmodulation band (which consists of a frequency interval of\n0.02 Hz centered around the modulation frequency peak, tracked\nin the band from 0.005 to 0.1 Hz); 2) the ratio (R) between the\nFigure 3. PSD applied to the SpO2 of whole study population.\nThe mean PSD (average of the PSDs obtained for each time window\novernight) for each SDB subject is represented in light grey, and\nNonSDB is represented in dark grey.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112959.g003\nScreening Tool for SDB in Children Using the Phone OximeterTM\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 November 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e112959\n2.2.1 SpO  pattern. All SpO2 values below 50% and above\n100%, and SpO2 changes between consecutive sampling intervals\n2\npower within the modulation band and total power; and 3) the\nShannon entropy (SE) of the PSD.\n2.2.2 Pulse Rate Variability (PRV).A baseline removal and\nsmoothing Savitzky-Golay filter (order 3, frame size 11 samples)\nwas applied to the PPG signal. A signal quality index, obtained by\nan adaptive version of the algorithm developed by Karlen et al.\n[34], was performed for automatic rejection of windows containing\nmotion artifacts. In order to obtain the time series of pulse to pulse\nintervals (PPIs) for each window, the locations of the peak of pulses\nin each segment of PPG signal were detected by a simple zero-\ncrossing algorithm. The intervals between successive peaks were\nsubsequently computed. The PPIs shorter than 0.33 seconds or\nlonger than 1.5 seconds were considered as artifacts and deleted\nfrom the time series. PRV was then obtained by converting each\nsequence of PPIs into an equivalent, uniformly spaced time series\n(sampling rate: 4 Hz), using a resampling method based on Berger\net al. algorithm [35].\nTime domain features:The mean of PPIs (representing RR, or\nthe time interval between two consecutive R waves in the ECG),\nthe standard deviation of PPIs (representing SDNN, or the\nstandard deviation of the so-called normal-to-normal (NN)\nintervals), and the root mean square of the successive differences\nbetween adjacent PPIs (representing RMSSD, or the root mean\nsquare of the successive differences between adjacent NN intervals)\nwere computed from each PPI time series.\nSpectral domain features: The spectral PRV analysis was\nperformed using a parametric PSD based on an autoregressive\nmodel of order 16. The power in each of the following frequency\nbands was computed by determining the area under the PSD\ncurve bounded by the bandwidth: Very Low Frequency (VLF;\n0.01–0.04 Hz), Low Frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz) and High\nFigure 4.

Normalized LF and HF powers\nwere determined by dividing LF and HF powers by the total\nspectral power within the 0.04 and 0.4 Hz band. The ratio of the\nlow-to-high frequency power (LF/HF ratio) was also computed.\n2.3 Data Analysis\nThe described feature set characterizes the behaviour of the\nSpO2 signal and PRV for each 2-minute time window. However,\nto identify children with SDB, the statistical distribution of each\ntime-varying parameter in the overnight recordings was evaluated\nthrough their means (M), medians (Me), standard deviations (S),\nand interquartile ranges (I) (see Table 2 for feature description).\nThe normality of each feature was assessed using the Shapiro-\nWilk test and visual inspection of the histograms and Q-Q plots. In\norder to evaluate the differences between SDB and NonSDB, two-\nsample t-tests for unequal variances were applied to the normally\ndistributed features.\nA logarithmic transformation was applied to non-normally\ndistributed features to convert them into normally distributed\nvariables. Two-sample t-tests for unequal variances were then\ncalculated using log-transformed data. In addition, Mann-Whitney\nU tests were also computed using the original data. A probability\nof p-value v0:01 was considered significant and a Bonferroni\ncorrection was applied where appropriate.\n2.4 Feature Selection and Classification\nLinear discriminant analysis was performed to classify children\nwith and without SDB. Based on the percentage of children with\nSDB in the dataset (39%), a prior probability of 0.4 was specified\nfor the linear discriminant analysis. An external N-fold cross\nvalidation (N = 4) was used to estimate the performance of the\nlinear discriminant. The dataset was randomly divided into N non-\noverlapping subsets. N-1 formed the training dataset (75% of the\ndataset, 110 children), and the remaining formed the test dataset\n(25% of the dataset, 36 children). Then, two tests were carried out.\nFirstly, the most discriminant features were selected using the\ntraining dataset. Secondly, the performance of this feature set was\nevaluated using the test dataset (Figure 5). This process was\nrepeated N = 4 times, until each subset was treated once as the test\ndataset.\nThe features most effective for classifying children with and\nwithout SDB were selected using a feature selection algorithm,\nbased on optimizing the area under the curve (AUC) of the\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve obtained with the\nFigure 6.

In addition, to\nquantify the benefits of combining SpO 2 pattern characterization\nwith PRV analysis, the same feature selection and classification\nwas performed using only the features extracted from the SpO 2\ncharacterization.\nResults\n3.1 Statistical Analysis\nIn total, we characterized the SpO 2 pattern and PRV of 146\nchildren (56 SDB, 90 NonSDB). The AHI was significantly higher\nduring REM sleep stages, and as expected the Body Mass Index\n(BMI) was significantly higher in the SDB group [36] (see\nTable 1).\nChildren with SDB showed a modulated SpO2 waveform due to\nthe desaturations caused by OSA. These SpO 2 fluctuations are\nreflected in the spectral domain through a clear modulation\nfrequency peak (see Figure 2 for a subject with and without SDB\nand Figure 3 for the population with and without SDB) and lower\nspectral complexity or randomness. In children with a high AHI,\nthe time varying PSD of the SpO 2 illustrated a clear modulation\nfrequency peak relative to children without SDB (Figure 4). The\npower in the modulation frequency band is positively correlated\nwith the AHI index (r = 0.7, p-value v 0.0001). Therefore,\nchildren with SDB showed higher power in the modulation\nfrequency band and thus a higher power ratio (M_P, M_R), with\nhigher power dispersion overnight (S_P, S_R), and lower spectral\nentropy (M_SE) than NonSDB children (Figure 6). SDB children\nalso showed higher SpO\n2 variability reflected by M D, M_iqr,\nM_std, M_CTM and higher overnight SpO2 dispersion associated\nwith S D, S_iqr, S_std and S_CTM. As expected, the number of\ndesaturations below baseline (M_n2%) and the time spent below\n92% (M_t92%) were higher in SDB children (see Tables 3 and 4).\nWith regards to PRV analysis, higher normalized LF power\n(M_LF), lower HF power (M_HF) and thus higher LF/HF ratio\nwas observed in SDB children, reflecting higher sympathetic\nactivity due to episodes of OSA. They also showed higher heart\nrate (M_RR) and higher overnight dispersion on PRV measures\nsuch as S_LF, S_HF, S_LF/HF, S_SDNN, S_RMSSD (see\nTables 3 and 4, and Figure 7).\nFigure 7. Distribution of PRV features.Boxplot of features extracted from PRV analysis such as (A) the mean of pulse to pulse intervals (M_RR),\n(B) the standard deviation of RMSSD (S_RMSSD) in time domain, (C) the standard deviation of the normalized power in the LF, and (D) HF band in the\nspectral domain (S_LF and S_HF, respectively). Children with SDB reflect higher heart rate and PRV dispersion, reflected by a lower pulse to pulse\ninterval and higher standard deviation of the standard PRV measures.

The\nbest internally cross-validated AUC = 88% was obtained with 8\nfeatures, providing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity rates above\n80% for the training dataset (see Figure 8.a and Figure 9.a). The\nperformance of the most discriminating 8 features evaluated on\nthe test dataset (Figure 8.b) provided on average, an AUC of 86%,\naccuracy of 84.9%, sensitivity of 88.4% and specificity of 83.6%.\nThe positive and negative predictive value showed that only\n76.9% of the children classified as SDB would have the disease,\nand 92.6% of the children classified as NonSDB would not. (See\nFigure 9.b and Table 5).\nThe combined SpO\n2 and PRV analysis improved the perfor-\nmance of the classifier identifying children with SDB. The AUC\nobtained with the SpO\n2 characterization alone (82%) increased to\n88% by including PRV information (see Figure 9).\n3.3 Performance of the Proposed Feature Set\nThe feature selection algorithm chose the 15 most discriminat-\ning features in each iteration (N = 4 iterations in total). The\nhistogram of the most discriminating features is represented in\nFigure 10, showing how many times each feature was selected in\nthe four different iterations. 5 features were selected in each of the\nfour iterations and 3 were selected in three of the four iterations,\nreflecting high discriminant value. Therefore, we selected these 8\nfeatures to screen children with and without SDB using a linear\ndiscriminant. These most discriminating features (marked with * in\nFigure 10) are related to the variability and modulation of SpO\n2\nand PRV due to intermittent apnea/hypopnea events during the\nsleep. A linear classifier based on this fixed 8-feature set provided\nan accuracy of 85.0%, sensitivity of 88.4%, specificity of 83.6%,\npositive predictive value of 76.0% and negative predictive value of\n90.6% using 4-fold cross-validation.\nDiscussion\nThis study shows that combining the SpO 2 pattern character-\nization and PRV analysis performed using the Phone Oximeter’s\nmeasurements (SpO2 and PPG), improved the Phone Oximeter’s\nperformance as a possible SDB screening tool. In 146 children\n(SDB prevalence of 38%) the SpO 2 fluctuations caused by SDB\nmodulated the SpO 2 signal, which was reflected in the frequency\ndomain by a clear modulation peak and less spectral randomness.\nTherefore, children with SDB showed significantly greater SpO 2\nvariability and overnight dispersion in the time domain, accom-\nFigure 8. Performance of the feature selection.The performance is represented in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in classifying\nSDB and NonSDB children, whenever the feature that provided the higher AUC (with the training set) was included in the linear discriminant. The\nresults obtained with (A) the training dataset (with internal LOO cross-validation) and (B) the test dataset (with external 4-fold cross-validation) are\nillustrated.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112959.g008\nScreening Tool for SDB in Children Using the Phone Oximeter\nTM\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 November 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e112959\npanied by higher SpO 2 spectral power at low frequencies\n(modulation band) and lower spectral complexity in the frequency\ndomain, than NonSDB children.\nSDB children showed higher sympathetic activity as a response\nto intermittent hypoxia and arousals during sleep. This was\nreflected by a significantly higher normalized power at low\nfrequency and lower normalized power at high frequency,\nresulting in a higher LF/HF ratio. These results confirmed\nprevious findings about cardiac modulation in subjects with SDB\n[19],[20],[37],[38].\nThe most discriminating features identifying children with SDB\nwere automatically selected (with internal cross-validation) and\nevaluated (with external cross-validation). The selected features\nwere related mainly to the spectral analysis of PRV, and SpO\n2\nvariability and modulation represented in the spectral domain.\nThis reflects the significant effect of intermittent apnea events and\nrespiratory arousals in the sympathetic and parasympathetic\nactivity, and the recurrent desaturations in the SpO\n2 pattern\nvariability. The best performance, obtained with 8 features,\nprovided higher accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values than\nthe SpO\n2 pattern characterization alone. The results showed that\nwhen using the Phone Oximeter as an SDB screening tool, 88.4%\nof the children with SDB would be correctly identified. However,\n23.1% of the children misclassified as having SDB, would be\nunnecessarily sent for a PSG, and 7.4% of the children with SDB,\nwould be wrongly classified as NonSDB and remain undiagnosed.\nBased on the feature selection histogram, a fixed set of the most\nfrequently selected features was suggested to create the optimal\nlinear discriminant. Similar cross-validated classification results\nwere obtained with the proposed optimal linear discriminant.\nOur results, obtained with the Phone Oximeter, are comparable\nwith previous studies with more sophisticated approaches or\ndevices. Heneghan et al. proposed a combined Holter-Oximeter as\na portable home-based device to automatically assess OSA in\nadults with signs of SDB [19],[20]. Their system provided an\nautomatic epoch-by-epoch estimate of OSA occurrence and\ncalculated an AHI for each subject. Overall the system correctly\nidentified 85.3% of all 1-minute epochs. Chung et al. reported that\noxygen desaturation index (ODI), calculated from nocturnal\noximetry, was a good predictor of AHI in adult surgical patients\n[39]. An ODI w5 provided an accuracy of 87%, sensitivity of\n96.3% and specificity of 67.3% identifying adults with an AHI\n§5. In this study, we focused on identifying children with SDB,\nwhich is more challenging than in their adult counterparts. Yet,\nthe Phone Oximeter alone provided similar accuracies, maintain-\ning a good sensitivity-specificity balance.\nGil et al. successfully associated amplitude fluctuations in the\nPPG signal with SDB, and used HRV calculated from ECG to\ndiscriminate between amplitude fluctuations related or unrelated\nto apneic events [37], [38]. In a similar study, they recently\nproposed using pulse rate variability (PRV) instead of HRV [40]\nand reported an accuracy of 86.67% in identifying children with\nSDB. However, their dataset consisted of 21 children, 10 of whom\nwere diagnosed with SDB. In our previous study, we obtained\nsimilar results (accuracy 86.8%) characterizing the SpO\n2 pattern of\n68 children, 30 of whom were diagnosed with SDB [24]. In this\nstudy, with a bigger cohort (146 children), we showed that\ncombining SpO\n2 pattern characterization [24] and PRV analysis\n[28], the Phone Oximeter provides a more robust stand-alone\napproach to screening for SDB in children. The sensitivity\nincreased from 80% to 88%, reflecting that with this analysis we\nwere able to detect more OSA events (perhaps those that occur in\nabsence of SpO\n2 desaturation). Furthermore, compared to ECG\nFigure 9.

Nixon et al. successfully\nproposed and validated a score system based on overnight\noximetry to prioritize surgery [12], [13]. The aim of our study is\ninstead to provide a screening tool that would prioritize children\nfor referral to a formal sleep laboratory, such as at BCCH, for\nPSG. We do not intend to diagnose SDB with the Phone\nOximeter, but to have an intermediate at-home monitoring step\nthat will reach more children suspected of having SDB in a timely\nand less-stressful means.\nA´ lvarez et al. proposed SpO2 regularity as useful information to\nimprove SBD diagnosis in adults and showed that subjects with\nSDB had lower SpO 2 regularity than NonSDB subjects [15].\nHowever, we obtained no significant difference in the SpO 2\nregularity between SDB and NonSDB children. In a recent study,\nwe found that theSpO 2 resolution had a major influence on\nregularity measurements and demonstrated that different resolu-\ntions provided different results. As it is illustrated in Figure 11,\nhigher SpO2 resolution permits observation of the small changes in\nthe SpO 2 signal, which have a great impact on the complexity\nvalue of the SpO2 signal. Therefore, the devices’ resolution should\nbe carefully considered when dealing with SpO 2 regularity to\nidentify children with SDB [41].\nConsidering the population in British Columbia under 14 years\nold (16% of 4,609,946 [42]), in conjunction with SDB prevalence\n[2] of 2%, around 14,750 children would suffer from SDB. In this\nstudy, 38% of children with signs of SDB referred to BCCH for a\nPSG, were diagnosed with SDB upon analysis of a full PSG.\nTherefore, approximately 38,815 children with signs of SDB may\nrequire a PSG at BCCH, where only 250 PSGs can be performed\nper year. The availability of PSG does not meet the demand\nrequirements, and results in long waitlists. The results of this study\nshow that using the Phone Oximeter as a screening tool prior to\nPSG could reduce the number of PSGs required to less than half,\nwhile effectively studying the same number of children. From the\n56 SDB children studied, 50 would have been correctly screened\nand sent for a PSG, while 6 cases of SDB would have remained\nundetected in the first screening test (false negatives). From the 90\nNonSDB children studied, 75 would have been correctly classified,\nwhile 15 children (false positives) would have been sent for PSG\nunnecessarily. In total, only 65 out of the 146 children (44%)\nwould have been referred to the hospital for a PSG. With a\ncapacity of only 250 PSGs per year at BCCH, and considering\nthat only 44% of the screened children require a full PSG, we can\nback-calculate that the number of patients that it is possible to\nscreen using the Phone Oximeter under current hospital\nlimitations is 568 per year (250 would be sent for a PSG, while\nthe remaining 318 children, would be watched for progression of\nsymptoms). In this manner, more than double the number\nchildren with signs of SDB could be screened each year, and\nsent for PSG if required. Therefore, using the Phone Oximeter\nwould result in increased coverage of medical services to children\nin British Columbia with signs of SDB, reducing wait times and\noptimizing usage of hospital resources.\nThe Phone Oximeter provides the perfect platform to create an\nSDB screening prototype, permitting overnight pulse oximetry\nrecordings and allowing implementation of the algorithm on a\nsmartphone. In addition, it can wirelessly communicate informa-\ntion (raw data, results etc.). More sophisticated analysis approaches\nsuch as the correntropy spectral density [25], [43], could be\napplied to the SpO 2 for a more robust spectral analysis that\nincludes nonlinear information. However, simpler algorithms are\npreferred so that they can be easily implemented on a smartphone\nwith low computational load. By using the low cost version of the\nPhone Oximeter, which interfaces the sensor directly with the\nphone via the audio jack, the cost to monitor SDB with the phone\nwill be reduced to that of the finger probe alone. The offline SpO 2\nand PRV analysis for the overnight study of each subject takes\nbetween 1 to 2 seconds. Real time performance is not required,\nsince we aim to provide a final screening result after the overnight\nrecording.\nThe pediatric population of this study includes children with a\nhigher likelihood of SDB than the general population, having\nFigure 10. Feature histogram.The histogram of the feature selection process, where the 15 most discriminating features were selected in each\niteration. The histogram illustrates the total number of times each feature was automatically chosen by the selection algorithm in each iteration (4 in\ntotal). The feature selection was validated internally with a LOO cross-validation and externally with 4-fold cross-validation. The features selected in\nevery iteration (4 times) or nearly every iteration (3 times) were defined as the most discriminating and were proposed as the optimal to create the\nfinal linear discriminant. They are represented in black and marked with *.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112959.g010\nScreening Tool for SDB in Children Using the Phone OximeterTM\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 November 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e112959\nFuture Work\nLimitations of the Study, Further Questions, and\nalready been referred to BCCH for a PSG. Although our target\npopulation for the SDB screening tool is children with signs of\nSDB, the utility of the Phone Oximeter in a general population\nwith a lower prevalence of SDB is presently unproven.\nA limitation of this study is that the recordings were performed\nin a hospital sleep laboratory at the BCCH. At-home screening is\nour goal for the next study. During recordings performed at home,\nwe expect artifacts caused by sensor displacement to be more\nsevere, which could degrade the performance of the Phone\nOximeter as an SDB screening tool. Therefore, the implementa-\ntion of an accurate artifact detection technique for the PPG and\nSpO\n2 signals, directly on the phone, is one of our main future\nchallenges.\nPrevious studies suggest that the indication for SDB treatment,\nprimarily adenotonsillectomy, is an AHI (from PSG) .5, which\ncoincides with the current practice at BCCH. Therefore, in this\nstudy we considered children with an AHI §5 as positive for SDB.\nHowever, there is no discrete definition of OSA based on AHI\nalone, but rather a continuum from normal to abnormal. We\nrecognize that some studies consider an AHI §2 as abnormal or\nmild OSA. For example, The Childhood Adenotonsillectomy\nTrial (CHAT), designed to evaluate the efficacy of early\nadenotonsillectomy versus watchful waiting with supportive care,\ndefined OSA as an AHI score ~ 2. Surgical treatment did not\nsignificantly improve attention or executive function in these\npatients, but did reduce OSA symptoms. However, the population\nin the CHAT study primarily had mild cases of OSA, reflected by\nthe AHI interquartile range (2.5 to 8.9) in the OSA positive group,\nwhich may have affected their assessment of treatment efficacy.\nTherefore, we will further investigate the Phone Oximeter’s\nperformance identifying children with SDB based on different\nAHI thresholds (AHI §1, AHI §2), using different classifiers. An\nAHI §2 will result in a recommendation for at-home monitoring,\nand an AHI §5 will result in a referral to BCCH for a PSG.\nThe most common cause of SDB in children is adenotonsillar\nhypertrophy [4], [5]. Most children can be discharged the same\nday following adenotonsillectomy surgery, however, those with\nadvanced SDB have a 20-fold higher risk of post anesthetic\nrespiratory complications. Therefore, the aim of our follow-up\nstudy is to adapt and test the innovative SDB screening tool in\nchildren with suspected SDB before adenotonsillectomy and the\nincidence of desaturation or ongoing SDB in the days following\nsurgery [8],[44].\nFigure 11. SpO2 signal with different resolutions.An SpO2 signal segment, recorded using the Phone Oximeter (0.1% resolution) for (A) SDB\nand (B) NonSDB children, and the corresponding SpO2 signal recorded simultaneously with the PSG’s pulse oximeter (1% resolution) for the same\nSDB (C) and NonSDB (D) children. The SpO2 resolution has a great influence in regularity measures like approximate entropy and Lempel-Ziv [41].\nTherefore, SpO2 resolution should be taken into account when studying the SpO2 pattern in children with SDB.The SpO2 randomness shown for\nNonSDB children in 0.1% resolution SpO2 signal (provided by the Phone Oximeter), is not reflected in the 1% resolution SpO2 signal (provided by the\nPSG’s pulse oximeter) because of the rounding effect. This resolution difference might be the reason why children with SDB showed a higher\ncomplexity than NonSDB children with conventional pulse oximeter.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112959.g011\nScreening Tool for SDB in Children Using the Phone Oximeter\nTM\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 November 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e112959\nThe time-varying characterization of the SpO 2 pattern and\nPRV is a suitable tool to provide further knowledge of SpO 2 and\ncardiac modulation during sleep apnea, to identify children with\nSDB. This provides the potential for the Phone Oximeter to be\nused as an SDB screening tool, providing a portable at-home\ndevice with the capability of monitoring patients over multiple\nnights. At-home screening will result in less sleep disturbance,\nfacilitate a more natural sleep pattern and prevent unnecessary\nburden to both families and the health care system. Additionally,\nthis tool has the potential to optimize resources by identifying\nthose children who should undergo a complete PSG test.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the clinical staff of the sleep laboratory at\nBritish Columbia Children’s Hospital for their collaboration and assistance\nwith data acquisition, Aryannah Umedaly and Richa Anand for helping to\nrevise this manuscript and Guohai Zhou for his advice regarding statistical\nanalysis.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: AG PD WK DW JMA GAD.\nPerformed the experiments: AG.
