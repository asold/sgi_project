INTRODUCTION \nINCE 2007 medium (0.1–5 MW) and la rge scale  (> 5 \nMW) photovoltaic (PV) power plants have attracted great \nattention and power plants of more than 10 MW in capacity \nhave thereby become a reality  [1], [2]. More than 200 PV \npower plants have already been installed in the world;  each of \nthem ge nerating an output of more than 10 MW. Of  these \nplants, 34 are located in Spain and 26 in Germany. The \nnumber of PV power plants will continue to rise. More than \n250 PV power plants will be installed within the next few \nyears. Future PV power plants will h ave higher  power \ncapacity. Indeed, some are to have a capacity in excess of 250 \nMW. These multi megawatt PV power plants require large \nareas of land.  Owing to this,  they are usually installed in \nremote areas, far from cities . The 20 MW PV power plant in \nBeneixama, Spain, used about 200 SINVERT 100M inverters \nand installed approximately 100,000 P V modules in a land \narea of 500, 000 m 2. For power transmission,  a step -up- \ntransformer is usually used in the PV inverter system to feed -\nin the solar energy into a medium voltage grid (typically  6–36 \n \nM. R. Islam, Y. G. Guo , and J. G.

ASEA B rown B overi (ABB) and Siemens developed \ninverters for medium scale PV power plants. ABB central \ninverters are especially designed for medium scale PV power \nplants. The PVS800 version is 3 -phase inverters with a power \ncapacity in the range of 100 –500 kW. The PVS800 inverter \ntopology allows a parallel connection directly on the ac  side, \nfor grid connection through a step -up-transformer. The \ntransformer steps-up the inverter output voltage from 300 V ac \nto grid vol tage level. ABB has been delivering worldwide \nvacuum cast coil dry -type transformers for PV applications. \nSiemens developed SINVERT PVS inverter for medium scale \nPV power plants. The ac output voltage and power capacity of \nPVS version inverters are in the r ange of 288–370 V and 500–\n630 kW , respectively. The 1 –2.52 M W central inverters can \nbe designed by parallel  connection of  2 to 4 PVS inverters \nthrough transformer and switchgear at the grid side. Siemens  \ndeveloped GEAFOL cast -resin transformers for grid \nconnection of PV arrays.  \nAlthough these special transformers are compact compared \nwith conventional distribution transformers, they are still large  \nand heavy for remote area PV applications  [3]. The large size \nand heavy weight step-up-transformer may increase the \nsystem weight and volume, and can be expensive and complex \nfor installation and maintenance. The medium-voltage inverter \nmay be the possible solution to connect the PV power plant  to \nthe medium-voltage grid directly. Moreover , it can be also \npossible to ensure electrical isolation through the inverter, \nwhich is important for the connection of PV power plants with \nmedium-voltage grids. Therefore, m edium-voltage inverters \nfor step-up-transformer-less direct grid c onnection of PV \nsystems have attracted great attention since the installation of \nlarge scale PV power plants commercially in 2007. \nIn 2011, different multilevel inverter topologies were \ncompared for possible medium-voltage grid connection of PV \npower plants  [4], [5]. Because of some special features , the \nmodular multilevel cascaded (MMC) inverter topology is \nconsidered as a possible candidate for medium-voltage \napplications. The component numbers of the MMC inverters \nscale linearly with the number of levels, and individual \nmodules are identical and completely modular in constriction , \nthereby enabling high-level number attainability. Furthermore, \nthe MMC inverter does not require any auxiliary diodes and \ncapacitors. Fig. 1 shows the requirements of auxiliary devices \nin different multilevel inverte rs. However, the MMC inverter \nrequires multiple-isolated dc sources that must be balanced . In \n2011, a high- frequency link was proposed to generate \nA Multilevel Medium-V oltage Inverter for Step-\nup-Transformer-less Grid Connection of \nPhotovoltaic Power Plants \nMd.

In the proposed system, only the auxil iary H -\nbridges are connected through high -frequency-link. The main \nH-bridges are supplied directly from the source, which means \nthere is no electrical isolation. Therefore, the use of this \ninverter is only for isolated winding motor applications. \n \n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\n0\n100\n200\n300\nNumber of levels\nNumber of auxiliary devices\nAuxiliary \ncapacitors in FC inverter\nAuxiliary diodes \nin NPC inverter\nNo auxiliary devices\n in MMC inverter\n \nFig. 1.

Proposed medium-voltage PV inverter system for step-up-transformer-\nless direct grid integration of PV power plants.   \n \n In 2011, a medium-frequency-link operated at a few kHz to \nMHz was proposed to generate m ultiple isolated and balanced \ndc sources for MMC  inverters from a single source [7]. In \norder to verify the feasibility of the new technology , a Metglas \namorphous alloy 2605SA1 ba sed medium-frequency link was \ndeveloped [8]. Compared with the power frequency \ntransformers, the medium-frequency link has much smaller \nand lighter magnetic cores and windings, thus much lower \ncosts. The amorphous alloy based medium -frequency link \nshows ex cellent electromagnetic characteristics, such as very \nlow specific core losses and possibility to generate multiple -\nbalanced sources [9].  \nIn 2012, by combination of a quasi -Z source inverter into a \nMMC converter, a medium-voltage PV inverter was  proposed \n[10]. The proposed PV inverter does not have isolation \nbetween PV array and medium-voltage grid. Multiple-isolated \ndc/dc converter based in verter topologies  were proposed in \n[11], [12]. In the proposed configuration, the voltage \nbalancing is the challengin g issue, since each H -bridge cell is \nconnected to a PV array through a dc/dc converter. \nCommon dc -link may be one of the possible solutions to \nminimize the voltage imbalance problem. In 2012, a common \ndc-link based PV inverter system was proposed [13], [14]. \nAlthough this design may reduce the voltage imbalance \nproblem in grid side, the genera tions of common dc -link \nvoltage from different PV arrays make the inverter operation \ncomplex,and accordingly limit the range of maximum power \npoint tracker (MPPT) operation. \nIn this paper, a three- phase medium voltage  inverter is \nproposed for step -up-transformer-less direct grid connection \nof PV power plants . A medium-frequency link (common \nmagnetic-link) instead of common dc -link is used to gener ate \nall the isolated an d balanced dc supplies of MMC  inverter \nfrom a single or multiple PV arrays . Accordingly, the link  \nguarantees electrical isolation between the grid and the PV \narrays. The basic block diagram of the proposed medium -\nvoltage inverter for medium and large scale PV power plants \nis shown in Fig. 2. The 11 kV and 33 kV inverter systems are \ndesigned and analyzed taking into account the specified \nsystem performance, control complexity, cost and market \navailability of the semiconductors. To verify  the feasibility of \nthe proposed inverter system, a scaled down 1.2 kV  laboratory \nprototype test platform  is developed with a 5 -level MMC \ninverter. The design and implementation of the prototyping \ntest platform , and the experimental results are analyzed and \ndiscussed. The advantages of the proposed PV inverter are: 1) \nstep-up-transformer-less and line-filter-less medium voltage  \ngrid connection; 2 ) an inherent minimization of the grid \nisolation problem through the magnetic -link; 3) an inherent  \ndc-link voltage balance due to the common magnetic -link; 4) a \nwide range of MPPT operation; and 5) an overall compact and \nlightweight system.  \n \nMedium voltage grid\nMedium-\nfrequency-link\nn\nCascaded H-bridges\na\nb\nc\nRectifiers\nCdc\nC\ndc\nC\ndc\nC\ndc\nC\ndc\nC\ndc\nQ\nCin\nPV array\nMedium frequency \ninverter\nMPPT\nL\nCdc\nH-bridge\nLeft top\nIGBT\nLeft bottom\nIGBT\nRight top\nIGBT\nRight bottom\nIGBT\nC\nModule\nRectifier (medium \nfrequency)\nH-bridge\nD\n \n \nFig. 3.

PROPOSED PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM \nIn this paper, as an alternative approach to minimize voltage \nimbalance problem with wide range of MPPT operation, a \nMetglas amorphous alloy 2605SA1 based common magnetic -\nlink is considered . The boost converter is considered  for \nMPPT function mainly. The array dc power is co nverted to a \nmedium-frequency ac  through a medium -frequency inverter. \nThe inverter also ensures constant output voltage. The inverter \nis connected to a primary winding  of a multiwinding medium-\nfrequency link. Each secondary winding works as an isolated \nsource and is connected to H -bridge cell through a bridge \nrectifier. The number of primary windings depends on the \nnumber of PV arrays and the number of secondary windings \ndepends on number of levels of the i nverter. The detailed \npower circuit of a 3-phase 5-level PV inverter system is shown \nin Fig. 3, which is used to validate the proposed inverter in the \nlaboratory. In large PV power plants, several PV arrays are \noperated in parallel. For this case multi -input and multi-output \nmagnetic-link can be used, where each PV array is connected \nto a primary winding through a booster and medium frequency \ninverter as shown in Fig.  2. The magnetic-link provides \nelectrical isolation between PV array and grid, thus inheren tly \novercomes common mode and voltage imbalance problems.  \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n1\n2\n3\nRated voltage or current (kV or kA)\nPer unit price (k AUD)\n \n \nPrice against rated voltage\nPrice against rated current\nRated current at 0.4 kA\nRated voltage at 1.7 kV)\n \n \nFig. 4.

DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM \nIf Vll(rms) is the grid line to line voltage and  L the number of \nlevels of the inverter, the m inimum dc-link voltage of each H -\nbridge can be calculated from \n \n)1(2 )(\n(min) −= L\nV\nV rmsll\ndc .

(3) \n \nThe highest voltage rating of commercially available \ninsulated gate bipolar transistor  (IGBT) is 6.5 kV and this is  \nsuitable for 2.5 kV or lower voltage inverter systems with \ntraditional 2 -level inverter topology. Although high -voltage \ndevices such as 3.3, 4.5 and 6.5 kV IGBTs are available in the \nmarket, they are sti ll costly as shown in Fig. 4 . The lower -\nvoltage devices, su ch as 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7 and 2.5 kV IGBTs \nare not only mature in technology but also cheap. On the other \nhand, the cascaded  connection of low -voltage rated  \nsemiconductors can be a cost effective solution for medium \nvoltage inverter applications. The high -number of levels \nmeans that medium-voltage attainability is possible to connect \nthe PV array to the medium-voltage ac network directly and \nalso possible to i mprove the output power quality.  The total \nharmonic distortions (THDs) of 11 kV and 33 kV inverter \nsystems are illustrated in Fig. 5 . The component number and \ncontrol complexity increase linearly with the increase of level \nnumber. Therefore, optimal selection of number of inverter \nlevels is important for the best performance/cost ratio of the \nPV systems. \nEach H -bridge cell communication voltage of a 7 -level \ntopology based 11 kV inverter is 2696 V which may be \nsupported by the 6.5 kV IGBT. Thus at least 7- level topology \nis required to design the 11 kV inverter. The output power \nquality of 21-level inverter is good enough to feed into the 11 \nkV ac  grid directly. The cheap 1.7 kV IGBT can be used to \ndesign the 21-level inverter. For a 33 kV system , at least 15 -\nlevel topology is required and 55- level topology is sufficient \nfor the power quality. Therefore, 7 -level to 21 -level modular \nmultilevel cascaded inverter  topologies are considered for an \n11 kV inverter system  and 15-level to 55 -level topologies are \nconsidered for a 33 kV inverter system . The device voltage \nutilization factor (DVUF ), ratio of commutation voltage of \nrespective commutation cells ( V\ncom) and device commutation \nvoltage for a device reliability of 100 failures in time (FIT) \ndue to cosmic radiation ( Vcom@100FIT), are summarized  in \nTables I and II. \n \nTABLE I  \nDVUF WITH DIFFERENT LEVEL NUMBER OF AN 11 KV SYSTEM \n \nLevel \nnumber Vcom Rated device \nvoltage kV Vcom@100FIT DVUF \n(%) \n7 2696 6.5 3600 75 \n9 2022 4.5 2250 90 \n11 1618 3.3 1800 90 \n13 1348 3.3 1800 75 \n15 1156 2.5 1200 96 \n17 1011 2.5 1200 84 \n19 898 1.7 900 99 \n21 809 1.7 900 90 \n \nHigher DVUF is essential for cost effective design, since \nsemiconductor cost is the significant figure in medium -voltage \n> REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE -CLICK HERE TO EDIT) < \n \n4 \ninverter applications. From Tables I and II , it can be seen that \nonly a few inverters have high DVUF. In order to ensure cost \neffective design, the in verters with level numbers of 9, 11, 15, \n19 and 21 for an 11 kV system  and 15, 23, 29, 43 and 55 for a \n33 kV system were considered for the further analysis.

Fig. 6 \nplots the on- state voltage drops of different rate d Mitsubishi \nElectric IGBTs . For these reasons, although the number of \ndevices increases linearly with the number of levels, the total \nconduction loss can be constant.  Therefore, the efficiency of \nthe multilevel inverter remains almost constant to the variation \nof number of levels , and  thereby the efficiency was not \nconsidered for the selection of number of levels.  \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 61\n2\n3\n4\n5\nDevice voltage rating\nOn-state\nvoltage drops (V)\nIGBT on-state \nvoltage drops\nCERtCE RIVV +=\n \nFig. 6.

Based on Tables V and VI, the \noverall performance graphs are plotted in Fig s. 7 and 8, \nrespectively. For an 11 kV inverter, the total index value is the \nlowest at 19 -level, because there is no significant output  \npower quality imp rovement and semiconductor cost  reduction \nfor i nverters with more than 19 levels. Furthermore, the \ncomponent number and control complexity increase linearly \nwith the increase in the number of levels. Therefore, 19 -level \ntopology is the optimal choice for an 11 kV PV inverter \nsystem. Similarly 43-level topology is the optimal choice for a \n33 kV PV inverter system.

Each \nhas its unique advantages and disadvantages. It is possible to \nreduce the switching losses by reducing the number of \nswitching in each period. Flatting the top of the reference \nsignal waveform in the third harmonic injected sinusoidal, \nsixty degree modulated sinusoidal and trapezoidal  not only \nallows the possibility of switching loss reduction but also \nincreases the range of linear modulation. In this paper, four \nmodulation schemes: the phase-shifted carriers with sinusoidal \nreferences (SPWM), the phase- shifted carriers with third \nharmonic injected sinusoidal references (THPWM), the phase -\nshifted carriers with sixty degree  modulated sinusoidal \nreferences (SDPWM) and the phase -shifted carriers with \ntrapezoidal type references (TRPWM)  are applied on the 7-\nlevel to 19 -level SCHB converter systems to analyze the \nperformance. Among these four modulation schemes the \nTHPWM scheme gives the best harmonic performance and \nSDPWM and TRPWM schemes have higher lower -order \nharmonic content than SPWM and THPWM schemes. \nMoreover, SPWM has shown higher reduction rate for high \nlevel number.  Table VII summarizes the harmonic \nperformance of different switching schemes. \nIV. E\nXPERIMENTAL TESTING AND RESULTS ANALYSIS \nA 5-level 3 -phase MMC inverter requires six  isolated and \nbalanced dc sources. To couple the PV array to the 5 -level \ninverter, a Metglas amorphous alloy 2605SA1 based medium-\nfrequency link with six secondary windings is used. To \nminimize the proximity effect, Litz wires are used for \nwindings with single layer placement as shown in Fig. 12 . The \nmedium-frequency link is excited by a 10 kHz square wave \nprimary voltage, which is generated by an H -bridge inverter  \nsupplied by a 220 V PV array. The output of each secondary \nwinding is connected to a fast recovery diode based rectifier \nwith a low pass  RC filter circuit. The electromagnetic \nperformances of all secondary windings were found almost the \nsame. Such similarity of characteristics is obligatory to \ngenerate balanced multiple sources for the MMC inverters. \nThe performance of digital signal processor (DSP) is \nlimited by the clock rate, and the number of useful operations \nper clock. In addition, t he available DSP can only at present \nprovide about six  pairs of PWM channels, which is  clearly \ninsufficient for the multilevel inverter systems (e.g. a 3-phase \n5-level inverter requires 24 PWM signals). In this paper , a \nfully digital switching controller  is developed and \nimplemented with a Xilinx XC3S500E field program mable \ngate array (FPGA). The mos t common software s such as \nMATLAB/Simulink and Xilinx ISE based design technique \nare used to develop the controller, which may save the \ndevelopment time and cos t of the switching controller.  Fig. 13 \nshows the basic architecture of the switching controller.  In \ntotal, three reference signals are requi red, one for each phase \nleg. L ook-up table s are used to generate the third harmonic \ninjected sinusoidal reference si gnals and pure sinusoidal \nreference signals (only one in operation at a time)  which \nmakes the control circuit totally digital and integrated. \nIncluding the inverted carrier signals, a total of four carriers \nare able to generate four gate pulses when compar ing them \nwith a reference signal. The other four gate pulses can be \ngenerated by just inverting these four gate pulses with a \nconsideration of deadtime. In this project, 9 -bit up -down \ncounters are used to generate phase-shifted carrier signals. Fig. \n14(a) shows the measured four PWM gate pulses  for the top \nH-bridge cell in phase B . The input/output voltage waveforms \nof the medium -frequency link and dc -link voltage of the H -\nbridge module are shown in Fig. 14(b).

The LC filter circuit is designed with 3 mH \nMTE RL 00401 reactor and 6 μF RS MR -P-MC-S-NF \ncapacitors. In each phase, three capacitors are connected in \nseries, which provides equivalent 2 μF capacitance with a \nrated voltage at 1.32 kV. The line  to line voltages before filter \ncircuit with SPWM  scheme are illustrated in Fig. 17(a). Fig. \n17(b) shows that the SPWM scheme gives higher THD, which \nwas about 27%. The performances are also observed with Y \nand ∆ connection of filter capacitors. The line voltages after \nfilter circuit are shown in Fig. 18 (a), when capacitors were Y \nconnected. The significant improvement was observed when \nfilter capacitors were ∆ connected; THD reduced from 4.5% to \nabout 3.2%. After filter circuit, the line voltages are depicted \nin Fig. 18(b), when capacitors are ∆ connected.  Fig. 19  shows \nthe zoomed (zoom factor = 6) output line voltages for different \ncombination of filter capacitors. The THPWM scheme \nprovides much better results than the results with SPWM, \nwhich was found highly consistent with the s imulation results. \nThe line voltage waveforms before filter circuit with THPWM \nare illustrated in Fig. 20 , which contains about 19% THD and \nafter filter it is reduced to less than 2.8 %.

The full load \noverall efficiency of the proposed system was measured at \n75%. Table VIII summarizes the efficiency of the prototype \ninverter with different load conditions. Compared with the \ntraditional PV inverter system  (2-level inverter section only ) \nabout 15% lower efficiency was evaluated. Although the \nproposed system gives about 15% lower efficiency than that of \na 2-level inverter, the overall performance is still similar to a \n2-level inverter based traditional PV system, because the \ntraditional s ystem uses two main additional components, i.e. \nline filter, and the step -up transformer. The step -up \ntransformers and harmonic neutralizing filters produce about \n50% of the total losses and occupy up to 40% of the system \nvolume [18]. With the proposed inverter, the elimination of \nthe heavy and large step -up transformer and line filter will \nenable large cost savings in terms of the installation, running \nand maintenance of PV power plants. \n \nTABLE VIII   \nEFFICIENCY OF THE PROPOSED PV INVERTER \n \nLoad (%) \nEfficiency (%) \nMultilevel inverter section Overall system \n25  75 50 \n50 86 65 \n75 89 70 \n100 92 74 \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, a new medium voltage PV inverter system is \nproposed for medium or large scale PV power plants. A \ncommon magnetic-link has been consi dered to interconnect \nPV arrays to form a single source. Multiple isolated and \nbalanced dc supplies for multilevel inverter have been \ngenerated through the common magnetic-link, which \nautomatically minimizes the voltage imbalance problem. The \ngrid isolatio n and safety problems have also been solved \ninherently due to electrical isolation provided by the medium-\nfrequency link. Although the additional windings and \nrectifiers may increase the loss  of the proposed inverter, still \nthe overall performance is similar with the traditional system, \nbecause the proposed inverter eliminates  three main parts: 2-\nlevel inverter, line filter, and step -up transformer from the \nsystem. In this paper , the proposed system has been validated \nby a scaled down 1.2 kV prototype syste m. The same concept \ncan be used to develop 6–36 kV  system by changing the \nnumber of secondary windings and the number of levels of the \ninverter. \nR\nEFERENCES \n[1] A. F. Panchula, W.
