INTRODUCTION  \nTHE cognitive capabilities of children develop during the \nearly years of their life. Research shows that learning a foreign \nlanguage helps develop cognitive skills. Preschool years are \nconsidered the best time for children to learn a second \nlanguage or to acquire a second language which is defined as \nlearning a second language after a first language is already \nestablished [1, 2, 3, 4 , 5 ]. Moreover, learning a foreign \nlanguage has become essential , and many  parents would \ndemand their children start learning a foreign language at an \nearly age. However, engaging young children with learning \nactivities or tasks are challenging due to their short attention \nspan compared to older children . Parents who want t heir \nchildren to learn another language might hire a tutor . \nHowever, hiring a teacher would not be affordable for most  \nfamilies, and a teacher will not be available anytime needed.  \nChildren become technology savvy and start enjoying apps on \nmobile devices even during toddler ages. Augmented Reality \napps especially grab the attention of young children with their \n'magical' features as they pop up a 3D virtual model of a \nchild's actual surroundings. Besides, the curious minds of \nyoung children like to engage in conversations with voice  \nassistants like Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft \nCortana, or Amazon Alexa.  Once Augmented Reality  \ntechnology is combined with Voice Assistant technologies , a \nsoftware tool can be realized for young children  to play and \nlearn a foreign language. A 3D avatar can pop up in a child's \nsurroundings to teach him/her a foreign language while having \nconversations or playing games. This 3D Avatar will \nessentially be a v oicebot to provide  children with a fun and \nengaging learning experience. Moreover, the voicebot will be \nmuch more cost-effective for the parents and will be available \nanytime to teach the child a foreign language. \nVoicebots (sometimes called conversational bots) are the \nproduct of recent technological advancements in AI, Machine \nLearning, Natural Language Processing, Voice Recognition , \nand Speech to Text technologies  [6]. Voicebots are currently  \nused m ainly as a customer -facing application  to answer \nproduct-related questions, order a product, or schedule an \nevent. We believe voicebots can be utilized for education and \nhave considerable potential for supporting education in many \n\n34 \n \n Copyright © The Journal of Cognitive Systems (JCS)                              ISSN: 2548-0650                                                                     http://dergipark.gov.tr/jcs \n \nTOPSAKAL; FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING UTILIZING AR, VOICEBOTS and ChatGPT \nfields, including foreign language teaching. When designed \nand implemented carefully, voicebots can be a game changer \nfor learning a foreign language, not only for children but for \nadults as well. \nOne of the challenges of such software is content creation. \nThe software needs to have dialogs ready for interactions with \nthe user. The interactions could be not only in the foreign \nlanguage but both in the native and the foreign language. The \ninteractions could aim to teach a specific subject, for example, \nto teach animals, numbers, shapes, colors, body parts, jobs, \netc. All these variations increase the cost and time neede d to \ndevelop such software.  \nRecently, ChatGPT  became available for public use , and \nwas surprised its users with its capabilities. It can generate \ncontent such as short stories  and dialogs based on the brief \ninstructions given by the user [7]. It can even generate code \nwhen the problem is defined. ChatGPT made content and code \ncreation amazingly easy. While ChatGPT might be available  \nfor public use  for a limited time , we believe that similar \ncapable large language AI models will be available soon for \ncontent creation. \nIn this study, we propose a framework for developing a \nlanguage learning software tool utilizing Augmented Reality \n(AR), Voicebots, and ChatGPT (an A I utilizing the Large \nLanguage Model) technologies to provide a unique product \nfor young children to teach a foreign language. With AR and \nVoicebots, the product will grab attention, motivate, and \nprovide an entertaining learning environment. The capabilities \nof ChatGPT (or a similar large language model) will be \nutilized to prepare the content for the software tool efficiently. \n \n2. DESIGN PRINCIPLES of a FOREIGN LANGUAGE \nTEACHING SOFTWARE SYSTEM \nDeveloping software for teaching a foreign language to \nchildren can be most effectively achieved if we can decide on \nthe design principles correctly. Based on the research on \nsimilar language learning tools, we propose that the software \nshould have the following components and properties [8]: \n Gamification \n Social Interaction \n Surprise Rewarding \n Application of Cognitive, Communicative, and Audio -\nLingual Methodologies \n \n2.1. Gamification \nDue to the positive effect of the game on learning, digital \ngames, which were previously for entertainment purposes, \nhave also started to be used in education. Recent studies have \nfocused on how games can be used effectively as teaching \nmaterials and how t hey will affect learning . A s a result ,  \nnumerous applications were developed that support learning \nwith gamification design in many areas of education . One of \nthese areas is foreign language education. \nToday, gamification has become an area that is constantly \ndeveloping and gaining popularity. One of the approaches to \ngamification design  was proposed by Werbach and Hunter  \n[9]. Their gamification design model includes 1) Determining \nthe objectives, 2) Determining the target behaviors and how \nto measure them , 3) Identifying the players  (grouped \naccording to their abilities, fears, future plans, and game type),  \n4) Preparing the activity cycles  (user should be able to \nprogress within the system and the difficulty level of the game \nshould be increased with each step taken) 5) Incorporating the \nentertainment element  for all types of users. 6) Using \nappropriate tools to progress according to the purpose, cycle , \nand user characteristics [10]. \nIn many studies on gamification, it is underlined that \ngamification makes learning more interesting and therefore \ncreates an effective and qualified learning process. At the \nsame time, it is emphasized that it supports cognitive, \nemotional, and social development by increasing motivation \nas it provides an active participat ion environment for \nindividuals [4]. By adopting gamification in the design \nprinciples of the software, we aim to increase the interest and \ncuriosity of preschool and elementary school children in \nlanguage learning,  \nAndrew Stott and Carman Neustaedter have included some \ndynamics and concepts that are applied in the learning \nenvironment and emphasized that they make success \npermanent by taking part in game design in their literature \nreview called \"Analysis of Gamification in Education\"  [7]. \nThese concepts include  freedom to fail, rapid feedback, \nprogression, and storytelling [10]. Gamification techniques \nare used to bring game players into a competitive environment \nthat has  feedback, score collection, badges, leaderboards, \nwinning prizes, etc. items were found [4, 11, 12, 13]. \n \n2.2. Social Interaction \nInteraction is the event that occurs mutually between people. \nSocial interaction, on the other hand, leads to dialogue and \ncommunication. Playing a game with more than one person \nrather than a single person will have a more successful \nlearning process if played interactively  in a social \nenvironment [14, 15. 16]. \n \n2.3. Surprise Rewarding \nSurprise rewards need to be  added to games  in order to \nincrease the time children spend in the application and to \nspend more learning time. Many products apply the technique \nof surprise rewards to make their user excited about the \nproduct. Nir Eyal mentioned in his book 'Hooked: How to \nBuild Habit -Forming Products', a product should include a \nSurprise/Variable Reward System as one of the techniques \nused to create a desire to use it over and over again. [17] \n \n2.4. Application of Cognitive, Communicative , and \nAudio-Lingual Methodologies \nThe software should  build new knowledge on previous \nlearning by following a hierarchical order in teaching foreign \nwords and sentences. It should also provide a learner-centered \napproach and enable children to control their own learning and \nmove them to the next stages in line with their own learning \npace. The voicebot will help users focus on first listening and \nspeaking skills. These can be achieved by applying  the \ncognitive method, the communicative method, and the audio -\nlingual methods.  \nIn the cognitive method, old learning is associated with new \nlearning to achieve a meaningful learning experience. Instead \nof memorization and mechanical learning, teaching is carried \nout with participatory learning and methods that support \nlearning that can create active memory. \nIn the communicative method, teaching is student -centered \nand teaching materials, environ ment, and activities are \nproduced specifically for students. Care is taken to produce \nthese materials in a way that reflects the culture of the target \nlanguage and is functional in daily life.  \n35 \n \n  \nTHE JOURNAL of COGNITIVE SYSTEMS, Vol.7, No.2, 2022 \nCopyright © The Journal of Cognitive Systems (JCS)                              ISSN: 2548-0650                                                                     http://dergipark.gov.tr/jcs \n \nAccording to the audio-linguistic method, the natural learning \nof the language begins with acquiring first listening and then \nspeaking, reading, and writing skills. For this reason, the \nmethod gives more importance to listening, understanding and \nspeaking than other skills. Structures and new words in the \ntarget language are taught through dialogues [8].  \n \n3. COMPONENTS of the  FOREIGN LANGUAGE \nTEACHING SOFTWARE SYSTEM \nWe propose that an engaging foreign language learning \nsoftware for young children needs to incorporate three main \ncomponents: \n Augmented Reality (AR.) \n Voicebots (Chatbots supported by speech-to-text and \ntext-to-speech) \n Content creation utilizing AI tools such as ChatGPT \n \n3.1. Augmented Reality (AR.) \nAugmented reality (A R) is a technology that overlaps \ncomputer-generated data (images, sounds, etc.) onto the user's \nview. It enhances the user's perception of the real world by \nadding layers of digital information to it [18]. \nAR can be experienced through a smartphone or tablet with \na camera and a specialized app  or through AR headsets or \nglasses. When the app is open, and the camera is pointed at a \nspecific image or object, the app recognizes it and displays \nadditional information or digital content on top of the user's \nview. \nAR has many potential applications  in many areas , \nincluding education, entertainment, and industry. For \nexample, A R can be used to visualize complex concepts, \ncreate immersive gaming experiences, or provide real -time \ninstructions and assistance in manufacturing or repair \nprocesses. Augmented Reality apps especially grab the \nattention of young children with their 'magical' features as \nthey pop up a 3D virtual model of a child’s real surroundings. \nAR can be an engaging and interactive way for children to \nlearn a foreign language. It allows children to actively \nparticipate in the learning process and makes it feel more like \na game than a traditional lesson. AR can provide children with \na context for learning new words and phrases. For example, \nchildren can learn about the objects in their surroundings and \ncan remember the words better as they are associated with \nreal-world objects and concepts.  AR can engage multiple \nsenses, such as sight, and sound which can make the learning \nexperience more immersive and memorable. \nAR technology can be embedded into mobile apps utilizing \none of the several AR frameworks such as ARCore, ARKit, or \nVuforia. ARCore is a part of the Android development \nsoftware development kit (SDK) developed by Google . \nARKit is a  part of the software development kit (SDK) \ndeveloped by Ap ple for iOS devices. On the other hand,  \nVuforia is a cross -platform AR development framework that \nallows developers to create A R experiences for a wide range \nof devices, including smartphones, tablets, and A R glasses. \nVuforia can be utilized for developing AR applications for \nboth Android and iOS platforms. For our prototype, we \nwanted to cover both iOS and Android devices, however did \nnot want to develop two separate mobile apps via two separate \ncode bases. Therefore, we decided to utilize Unity3D to \ndevelop a mobile app for AR using a single code base and then \nexport it for iOS and Android. Unity is a cross-platform game \ndevelopment platform that allows developers to create 2D, \n3D, A R, and V R games and experiences for a variety of \nplatforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, and console \nplatforms. Inside the Unity development environment, we \nutilized Vuforia software libraries for A R development and \nwere able to export the Unity project as iOS and Android \nprojects. \nSeveral AR products have been introduced to teach children \nlanguage concepts. These products include:  \n Magical Animals [1],  \n Neobear Popup Zoo (www.neobear.com),  \n ZooKazam (www.zookazam.com),  \n Shifu Safari \n (www.playshifu.com),  \n Animal 4D+ (www.octagonstudio.com) \n \nOnly two of these focused on foreign language teaching  and \nonly one incorporate d voice, text , and voice recognition  in \ntheir product. \n \n3.2. Voicebots \nThe developments in machine learning, speech recognition , \nand text-to-speech technologies in recent years have made \npossible the developments in virtual personal assistants. For \nexample, virtual personal assistants such as Apple Siri, \nMicrosoft Cortana, Google Assistant , and Amazon Alexa, \nwhich have become widespread in use, provi de many \nconveniences to people in their daily lives and have become \nroutine helpers for operations such as sending e-mails, making \nphone calls, changing music, and sending messages. \nConversational robots (chatbots) developed with similar \ntechnologies can answer the phone and perform special tasks \nsuch as taking orders and giving directions. Many commercial \nproducts with varying capabilities that help the development \nof chatbots emerged. Some of them are listed here: \n Dialogflow (https://dialogflow.com) \n IBM Watson Assistant \n(https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/) \n Amazon Lex (https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) \n ManyChat (https://manychat.com/) \n Chatfuel (https://chatfuel.com/) \n Wit.ai (https://wit.ai/) \n MindMeld (https://www.mindmeld.com/) \n Chatbot (https://www.chatbot.com) \n Azure Bot Service (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-\nus/services/bot-service/) \n \nThe listed products are not for foreign language learning but \nfor producing chatbot applications. They take a text as input \nand output a text. Most of them lack voice-to-text or text-to-\nspeech capabilities. Our goal is to develop voicebots. The only \nproduct on the market that utilizes voicebots to teach a foreign \nlanguage is Mondly 's Conversational Chatbot. However, \nMondly's product is developed for adults and does not include \nany gamification features. It is more like a regular chatbot \nwith speech recognition capabilities. \nThe chatbot development products listed above can be \nutilized to create  voicebots once voice-to-text or  text-to-\nspeech functionality is integrated. In our prototype, we \nutilized DialogFlow (a product offered by Google) due to its \nease of integration with the voice -to-text or text -to-speech \nfunctionality. Google's DialogFlow is also built on top of the \n36 \n \n Copyright © The Journal of Cognitive Systems (JCS)                              ISSN: 2548-0650                                                                     http://dergipark.gov.tr/jcs \n \nTOPSAKAL; FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING UTILIZING AR, VOICEBOTS and ChatGPT \nGoogle Cloud Platform, so it will be easy to scale when the \nnumber of users increases. It also supports many languages. \nThere are four important concepts when developing a chatbot \nwith Dialogflow: \n Agent: A Dialogflow agent is similar to a human call \ncenter agent. You train both to handle expected speaking \nscenarios, and your training doesn't have to be overly \nexplicit. Agents also act as a high -level container for \nsettings and data \n Intents: Links between what the user says and how you \nwant the system to respond \n Entities: These are the subject categories your bot \nunderstands. For example, if your chatbot is for a clothing \nstore, an entity category might be a product type: shoes, \ndresses, pants, hats, and another entity might be size: \nlarge, xl, small, medium, and another color. \n Context: Information obtained by the bot during the \nconversation. For example, the user's name or the users' \nfavorite shoe color. \nThe interaction from the user is met by the agent and answered \nby the most appropriate intent (intent m atching) defined for \nthe agent. In the selection of intent, the interacting words and \nthe previous words spoken during the conversation play an \nimportant role. With training phrases and parameters defined \nfor 'Intent', it prepares the response (response) a nd delivers it \nto the user. \n \n \nFig.1. DialogFlow Interactions (Image Credit Google DialogFlow \nDocumentation) \n \nFigure 1 shows the flow of interactions between a user and a \nchatbot implemented using Dialog Flow. Voice inputs from \nthe user are translated into text and transmitted to the \nDialogflow agent as input. The 'intent' corresponding to the \ntext transmitted to the Dialogflow agent is selected  based on \nthe training phrases entered for intents. After the inte nt that \nwill respond to the interaction from the user is determined  \n(intent matching) , the 'fulfillment' code, whose answer is \ndetermined for the intent, is prepared. This fulfillment code \ncan be an external API and prepare the response after \ninteracting with an external database. \nFigure 2 shows the Interactions between the components of a \nvoicebot. In response to the child's interactions (via speaking), \nthe voice recognition software , embedded or called from \nwithin the software that is  developed using the Unity \ndevelopment environment , translates the voice into text and \ntransmits it to an agent in the Dialogflow. One of the many \nintents defined in this agent is selected via intent-matching \nalgorithms to answer the incoming text. If a dynamic response \nis not required, the response is prepared by the intent and \nreturned to the software without going to external APIs. If a \ndynamic response from the external environment is required, \nthese external services are accessed via web interfaces and the \nprepared response is returned to the intent and then forwarded \nto the software. \n \n \nFig.2. Interactions between the components of a voicebot \n \nDuring the development process of Voicebot, Google \nDialogflow product and Google Cloud Platform's speech-to-\ntext, translation, and text-to-speech products were used. As \nseen in Figure 2, the user interacts with the mobile application \ndeveloped in the Unity3D environment. After the user's voice \nis translated into text with 'Speech -to-Text', it is sent to  \nDialogFlow. The answer text prepared in Dialogflow is \nconverted into sound with 'Text-to-Speech' and transmitted to \nthe user. In this interaction, the APIs of the Google Translation \nlibrary are used when text is needed to be translated between \nlanguages. \n \n3.3. Content Creation Utilizing AI tools (ChatGPT) \nDesigning conversations is a very important, challenging, and \ntime-consuming task. The success of a voicebot heavily \ndepends on how the interactions take place. To overcome the \ntask of content generation , we propose to utilize an artificial \nintelligence (AI) tool, specifically, a  large language model  \nChatGPT [19]. \nLarge language models are trained to generate human -like \ntext. They are called \"large\" because they are typically trained \non very large datasets of text, often consisting of billions of \nwords or more. The size of the data used to train a large \nlanguage model can vary widely, but it is typically measured \nin billions of words. For example, the GPT-3 language model \ndeveloped by OpenAI was trained on a dataset of over 8 \nbillion words [20, 21], while the BERT language model [22], \ndeveloped by Google was trained on a dataset of over 3 billion \nwords.  \nLarge language models have many potential applications, \nincluding natural language processing tasks such as \ntranslation, summarization, and question answering, as well as \ngenerating original content for a variety of purposes. They \nhave been used to generate news articles, stories, and even \npoetry, and have the potential to revolutionize many fields that \nrely on text generation and understanding. \nGPT and BERT are two of the well -known large language \nmodels. GPT (Generative Pre -training Transformer ) is a \ntransformer-based language model developed by OpenAI in \n2018 that has been trained on a large dataset of web pages and \nbooks. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from \nTransformers) is ano ther transformer -based language model \ndeveloped by Google that has been trained on a large dataset \nof books and articles. New versions and variations of GPT and \nBERT have been introduced such as GPT -2, GPT -3, \nRoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT) , and ALBERT ( A \nLite BERT) [21, 22, 23, 24]. \n\n37 \n \n  \nTHE JOURNAL of COGNITIVE SYSTEMS, Vol.7, No.2, 2022 \nCopyright © The Journal of Cognitive Systems (JCS)                              ISSN: 2548-0650                                                                     http://dergipark.gov.tr/jcs \n \nLarge language models have the potential to revolutionize \nthe way that languages are taught and learned, by providing \naccess to high-quality, customized, and personalized language \nlearning materials. \nWe have tested ChatGPT to generate dialogues that would \nhelp in learning a foreign language. Some of the initial \ndialogues and subjects that are covered while teaching a \nforeign language , especially with young children, are \nintroducing oneself, and conversations about animals, foods, \nvehicles, family members, body parts, vehicles, occupations, \netc. We have asked the following prompts to ChatGPT, a large \nlanguage AI model. \n \nTABLE I  \nUTILIZING CHATGPT TO GENERATE DIALOGUES TO TEACH \nFOREIGN LANGUAGE \nChatGPT Prompt: Generate a dialogue to teach English to young \nchildren whose native language is Turkish.

DISCUSSION \nIn recent years, studies have been carried out on teaching \nforeign languages with social robots. The 3D Avatars that will \nbe utilized in the software along with  augmented reality are \nsimilar to a robot. These studies revealed that the utilization \nof social robots  improved the outcomes of foreign language \nlearning tasks. It has been observed that learning \nachievements increase after spending more time with the robot \n[24]. According to these studies, the interactions with social \nrobots (virtual 3D avatars) must be designed in a way that is \npleasing, pedagogically sound , and challenging the limits of \nthe learner [25, 26, 27, 28]. According to the studies, it would \nbe meaningful to choose well -known word groups learned in \nthe mother tongue in the selection of foreign language words \nthat are aimed to be taught. The meaningful and interesting \ncontent of the teaching will also increase learning. In addition, \nit was recommended that the learning period be 10 -15 weeks \nin 15-20 minutes doses every day and that a maximum of 6 \nwords should be taught each time and each word should be \nrepeated at least 10 times [28].  \nSoftware developed using the framework can scale in  \nseveral dimensions including o ffering products in new \ncountries with new native language options, offering products \nto teach new foreign languages, and offering new products to \nteach more content and concepts to cover more of the \npreschool curriculum for foreign language . Such a foreign \nlanguage software will serve millions of families since there \nare approximately 26 million children between the ages of 4 \nand 8  in the Europe Union  and there  are about 17 million \nchildren between the ages of 4 and 8 in the USA.

CONCLUSION \nWe hope the framework we present here for developing \nforeign language teaching software will help bring innovative \nproducts to the market and will have a positive social impact. \nWhen children excel in a foreign language at an early age that \nmeans they communicate and understand each other better and \npossibly embrace the similarities and differences.  \nRecent advancements in technology enable developers, \nresearchers, and entrepreneurs to realize the components of \nthe proposed framework more rapidly than ever. The \ncognitive development of young children can be increased by \nintroducing them to foreign languages in a way that will grab \ntheir attention and engage them  by utilizing Augmented \nReality and Voicebots.  The content for the foreign language \nteaching software can be conveniently produced using large \nlanguage models such as ChatGPT. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Topsakal, Elif & Topsakal, Oguzhan.
