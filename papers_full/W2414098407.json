  "abstract": "An effective system for monitoring the wear of the machine tool inserts could significantly contribute to saving costs in manufacturing. One of the most recent and popular of effective monitoring methods revolves around the use of sensing technologies for indirect estimation of tool wear. The sensory information is difficult to collect from machine tools due to the extremely poor signal-to-noise ratio of the relevant tool wear-related information because the milling operation is of interrupted nature since the work piece is in contact with the tool edge several times per second. Another issue is the varying thickness of the chip during the penetration of the work piece. Yet, many challenges still impede the practical application of this method for industrial environment. Therefore, the paper presents a method that could solve these challenges especially in industrial environment. The proposed self-powered wireless sensor node is integrated in the structure of the cutting tool. The voltage generated from the cutting tool vibrations of the harvester exponentially rises when the capacitor is fully charged and wireless signal sent to the receiver. As the intensity of energy accumulation depends on the state of the cutting tool wear, it indicates and detects the tool condition. The proposed technique could be useful for the identification of the cutting tool quality and the relative tool-work piece position. The information about the variation of tool wear is beneficial for helping the manufacturers to control the cutting process, to minimize the product cost as well as to improve the machining quality and efficiency.",
