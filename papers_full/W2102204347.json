    "abstract": "This paper introduces MTConnect[1], a data exchange standard that allows for disparate entities in a manufacturing system along with their associated devices to share data seamlessly in a common format. MTConnect aims to provide a common means for communication between these varied devices, and is not creating special purpose hardware or software for this purpose. This paper also presents a case-study of using MTConnect data from a machine tool for process planning verification. The potential of improved machine-tool interoperability through MTConnect is also discussed, with an emphasis on enabling “green manufacturing” through better interoperability.",
