They are so good that they even capture \nundesirable or unfair associations. Bolukbasi et  al. (2016) showed how word \nembeddings capture associations such as a Man will be a computer programmer  \nwhile Woman will be a home-maker. The work by Caliskan et al. (2017) will later \nshow how data-driven trained models in artificial intelligence are able to capture \nall kinds of prejudices and human-like biases. This is not exclusive to word \nembedding models, in more recent and more complex models this behavior is still \npresent (Garrido-Muñoz et al., 2021). A clear example is the recent GPT-3 (Abid \net al., 2021) model that shows a bias towards the Muslim religion by associating \nit with violence in a high number of cases. These associations are also present in \nwidely used pretrained models like BERT (Bender et al., 2021).\nActually, these models are part of multiple systems and applications, so \nundesirable associations may be reflected directly or indirectly in their output. We \ncall these types of associations bias and define bias as any prejudice for or against \na person, group, or thing. Bias can be reflected in various dimensions such as \ngender (Bhardwaj et  al., 2021; Zhao et  al., 2018b), race (Nadeem et  al., 2021; \nManzini et al., 2019), religion (Babaeianjelodar et al., 2020), ideology (McGuffie \n& Newhouse, 2020), ethnicity (Groenwold et al., 2020), sexual orientation, age, \ndisability or even appearance (Nangia et al., 2020).\nDealing with bias in language models mostly involves two different tasks: \nevaluation (to measure how biased is a model) and mitigation (to prevent or \nreduce the bias in a model). Most of the work done in bias research on language \nmodelling is focused on the English language. In this paper, we present a novel \nframework for gender bias evaluation and apply it to some of the most popular \nSpanish pretrained language models, including multilingual ones where Spanish \nis among the supported languages. Our approach for bias evaluation is based \non previous literature, opting for a mechanism that measures differences in the \nprobability distribution of certain words in a masked language task. Our proposal \nfocuses on adjectives as targeted terms. In our contribution, measurements have \nbeen done at a higher level of abstraction, by grouping adjectives in semantic \nclasses according to different classification schemes. Our main findings are that \nthere are different levels of bias across analyzed pretrained models and that \ngender bias is mainly focused on body appearance when comparing male versus \nfemale proposed adjectives. In order to establish a base case, a set of simple \ntemplates has been prepared to contain a masked word where an adjective should \ngo. For each template, we will measure and compare the suggestions that each \nmodel generates. By comparing the bias of models towards certain categories of \nadjectives, the method eases the interpretation of this bias.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss \nwhy bias-free resources are needed and what the impact of bias is on society, as \nwell as the legislative changes it is leading to. Section 3 serves as a walkthrough \nof the previous work done on bias evaluation. In the fourth section, we design an \n1389\n1 3\nMarIA and BETO are sexist: evaluating gender bias in large…\nevaluation method. The fifth section shows the results when applying this method \nover several Spanish models to evaluate the degree of gender bias. Finally, we \nprovide some brief conclusions and foresee some future work.\n2  The need for unbiased models\nThe presence of bias in a model is the symptom of multiple issues throughout the \ntraining process. In the first place, the problem might be in the data fed to the model. \nIf the data source under-represents one class of a protected attribute (e.g. gender) \nrelative to its multiple values (e.g. male versus female), then model predictions will \nalso favour the most represented attribute class while the underestimation for the \nminority class will be accentuated (Blanzeisky & Cunningham, 2021).\nUnequal representation is particularly problematic when this ends up affecting \nsensible decision systems, as it happened with a U.S. healthcare system algorithm \nthat underestimated the illnesses of black people (Obermeyer et  al., 2019). In \nlanguage models this problem also exists; for example, Ramezanzadehmoghadam \net al. (2021) studied the distribution of gender (male/female) and race (Caucasian/\nAfrican) in the BERT vocabulary against the Labour Market Distribution and found \nthat the model’s vocabulary contains 100% of studied male and female names but \nonly 33% of male Africans and 11% of female Africans.\nRegarding models trained for classification tasks (named entity recognition, \nsentiment analysis, text classification and so on) bias is also present, as those models \nare trained from human annotations that may not adequately represent reality or \neven if annotators manifest their personal biases in the labelling process. Actually, \nAl Kuwatly et  al. (2020) explore whether the demographic characteristics of the \nannotators produce biased labelling and finds that it does happen, so there are some \ncharacteristics that affect labelling such as language proficiency, the age range of \nthe annotator, or even the educational level of the annotator, while features such as \ngender do not make a difference in the suggested task.\nWe could also consider biased training methods or even biased source media. It \nis interesting to ask ourselves questions like: Does the model behave in the same \nway in different classes? Is the model able to encode words with unusual language-\nspecific characters? If the model recognizes people, is it able to operate with the \nsame quality, regardless of race or even with different literacy levels? We consider \nquestions like these necessary. Bias analysis can go even further and study the full \npipeline of processes involved in the training of the final model. For example, BERT \nencodes words as tokens, and some words are encoded as a pair of tokens instead of \na single token. Does it affect the output in some way? Is the effect the same for the \ndifferent classes? Any aspect may exhibit a side effect in terms of biased output in \na language model, as these models (tokenizers, encoders, decoders...) learn patterns \nfrom massive collections of real-world texts.\nWe have multiple examples of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models that turned out \nto be biased, such as Amazon’s recruiting tool that turned out to penalize women \n(Dastin, 2018). Apple’s sexist credit cards applied an algorithm that sets different \nlimits for men and women (Kelion, 2019). Google removed the word gorilla from \n1390 I. Garrido-Muñoz et al.\n1 3\nGoogle Photos when it was discovered that the system tagged labelled black people \nwith that word (Simonite, 2018). Gary (2019) collected more examples of AI \nsystems showing unfair, unethical, or abusive behavior. Once a model is biased and \nused in production systems, this bias and prejudice will feed into other systems and \nsociety’s perception (Kay et al., 2015).\nThe proliferation of these non-transparent and non-auditable AI-based models is \nprompting proposals for changes in European legislation. From setting up an agency \nfor AI monitoring in Spain (Europa Press, 2021) to the ban on systems that exploit \nvulnerabilities of protected groups due to their age, physical or mental disability \n(Jane Wakefield, 2021; MacCarthy & Propp, 2021). Legislation is also being passed \nto ensure the transparency of AI systems by establishing obligations to consider \nhigh-risk AIs reliable, among which are those related to data quality, documentation, \ntraceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, and robustness (European \nCommission, 2021). These rules are complemented by Article 13(2)(f) of GDRP \nwhich specifies that, in certain cases, in order to ensure transparent and fair data \nprocessing, the data controller must provide meaningful information about the \nlogic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such \nprocessing for the data subject (European Commission, 2018).\n3  Bias in deep learning models\nThe bias phenomenon in deep language models has been clearly identified (Garrido-\nMuñoz et  al., 2021). The study of bias usually involves two main tasks: the \nevaluation task, in which the aim is to characterize the bias and make measurements \nto quantify it; and the mitigation task, in which the objective is to eliminate the bias \nor mitigate its effect. After mitigation, the same techniques used in the evaluation \nare used to check whether the measured bias has been reduced or not. Not all works \nfocus on both aspects of the bias problem. In our case, we have focused this work \non the evaluation of gender bias in pretrained language models for Spanish based on \ndeep neural networks.\nOne of the first forms of bias in language models was found in word embeddings. \nBolukbasi et  al. (2016) highlights how the model captures strong associations \nbetween some professions and the male gender and other professions with the \nfemale gender. According to the model analysed, a man would be a teacher, a \nprogrammer, or a doctor, while a woman would be preferably a housewife, a nurse, \nor a receptionist. Actually, in the embedding space, the analogy father → doctor so \nmother→ ? is resolved with nurse, for the model there is no such thing as a female \ndoctor. Caliskan et al. (2017) will later show how AI models are able to capture all \nkinds of prejudices and human-like biases. This work makes the first tests with racial \nbias, quantifying it by comparing the results of the model with preferably African \nnames versus preferably European names, confirming that there is indeed bias in the \nstudied model. The authors also question the impact that this could have on NLP \napplications such as sentiment analysis. Ideally, the outcome of sentiment analysis \ncontained in the ratings of a film, product, or company should not be affected by the \n1391\n1 3\nMarIA and BETO are sexist: evaluating gender bias in large…\nnames of its protagonists, workers, or other involved people names, but that cannot \nbe ensured due to the presence of unequal treatment of proper names.\nThe study of bias based on measuring associations is continued by Caliskan et al. \n(2017), who developed WEAT (Word Embedding Association Test) as a mechanism \nto measure the association between two concepts based on the cosine of their vector \nrepresentations.\nThis test measures the association between a set of words and a set of attributes by \napplying cosine similarity to measure the distance between the vectors representing \nthe embeddings of these words. It does so for a pair of sets of words of equal sizes, \nsuch as European American names = {Adam, Harry, Josh, Roger,...} and African \nAmerican names = {Alonzo, Jamel, Theo, Alphonse,...}  with respect to two attribute \nsets to which the association is to be studied. For example, to measure whether there \nis a positive or negative association of names with respect to their origin, it uses \nthe attribute sets Pleasant = { caress, freedom, health, love, peace, cheer,...}  and \nUnpleasant = {abuse, crash, filth, murder, sickness}.\nThis technique will be widely used and adapted to sentences, known as SEAT \n(Sentence Encoder Association Test) (May et  al., 2019) and even to context-\ndependent neural models such as BERT. Such a technique would be adapted \nunder the new name CEAT (Contextualized Embedding Association Test) \n(Babaeianjelodar et al., 2020) or variants like SWEAT (Bianchi et al., 2021) which \nconsiders also polarized behaviors between values for one single concept.\nAll this literature studies bias as a problem of harmonizing vector space models. \nIn the case of attention models, such as BERT (Vaswani et  al., 2017), the task is \nmuch more complex, as we have to deal with language models and not just word \nmodels. An alternative way to study the model’s behavior is by means of its results, \nrather than the internal encoding mechanisms. To this end, it is possible to continue \nwith the association approach. Following this approach, multiple datasets have \nbeen proposed, such as Winobias (Zhao et  al., 2018a) with 3160 sentences for \nthe study of bias in co-reference resolution; StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021) with \n170,000 sentences for the study of stereotypes associated to race, gender, profession \nor religion; the more recent BOLD set (Babaeianjelodar et al., 2020) with 23,679 \nsentences; StereoImmigrants(Sánchez-Junquera et  al., 2021), an annotated dataset \non stereotypes towards immigrants, in Spanish, consisting of 1685 stereotyped \nexamples and 2019 non-stereotyped examples; or the contribution of Nangia \net  al. (2020) with CrowS-Pairs, which contains 1508 sentence pairs to measure \nstereotypes in a total of 9 different categories. Unfortunately, all the corpus creation \nefforts specialized in bias detection and evaluation are for English, which leaves a \nbig gap in resources to study bias in non-English language models.\nTo understand how benchmark datasets work, we detail how StereoSet works \n(Nadeem et al., 2021). It proposes two types of tests based on predefined sentences; \nthe first one leaves a gap in sentences and three possible options are given: one of \nthe words corresponds to a stereotype, another to an anti-stereotype, and, finally, a \nrandom unrelated word. Thus, it is possible to measure which of the three is more \nlikely to be selected by the model and, therefore, to know if the model replicates \nbias (stereotyped) or moves away from it (anti-stereotype). The second test consists \nof a set of sentences that establish a context accompanied by three sentences each, \n1392 I. Garrido-Muñoz et al.\n1 3\none of them being stereotyped, another anti-stereotyped, and another unrelated. The \nintention of this test is the same as the previous one, from the sentence that is most \nlikely to appear we will know whether the model is stereotyped or not. StereoSet \npresents an extensive set of tests according to what has been described, with the \ncorresponding stereotype annotation. Our approach takes from this work the idea of \nmeasuring bias from a given context by means of the models’ ability to fill a mask in \na predefined text.\nStereoSet is not the only context-related based work. Bartl et al. (2020) proposes \nto study bias by capturing the probability of association between a term referring \nto a profession and another term referring to gender. It performs this study for \nEnglish and German. For example, the template <person_subject> is a \n<profession>, would generate a list of professions sentences such as he is a \nteacher and she is a teacher, or My brother is a kindergarten teacher and My sister \nis a kindergarten teacher. This type of test works very well for English because of \nthe lack of gender inflection in adjectives or determinants, so writing these patterns \nis not very difficult. For a heavily inflected language, like Spanish, this approach is \nnot easy to implement.\nThe work by Nozza et al. (2021) shows an evaluation framework based on text \ncompletion. By counting how many times the selected word by the language model \nwas a word was in the HurtLex lexicon, it was possible to measure how stereotyped \nwas the model according to the lexicon categories. Yet, an overall metric on how \nbiased is the model is difficult to be drawn from this method. Besides, as the authors \npoint out, considering only harmful expressions misses other stereotypes related to \ngender bias like \"men are more intelligent” or \"the value of a woman depends on its \nbeauty\".\nIn a previous work (Muñoz et  al., 2022), a system was built to support the \ntechnological infrastructure needed to implement the approach detailed in this paper. \nThis was an early attempt to analyse gender bias in deep learning using a visual \napproach.1 This work was a demonstration of the tool that was the starting point of a \nmore exhaustive approach, the one presented in this paper.\n4  Designing of the evaluation framework\nIn order to evaluate how biased is a language model towards a specific protected \nattribute (gender, in our case), we have designed a method based on a masked \nlanguage task and assuming the following hypothesis: a language model is \nconsidered to be gender-biased if it presents significant differences in the probability \ndistribution of adjectives between male sentences and their female counterparts.\nBelow is the notation of the concepts that are part of the evaluation framework \n(See Table 1).\n1 The tool is available at https:// dllas. ismael. codes/\n1393\n1 3\nMarIA and BETO are sexist: evaluating gender bias in large…\n4.1  Feasibility of previous methods to the Spanish case\nThere are several works that attempt to measure bias for English data models, \nas we have seen. Our first approach was towards the translation of the published \nevaluation frameworks into Spanish, but the peculiarities in how Spanish treats \ngender in a sentence forced us to design an evaluation corpus from scratch. While \nthe grammatical gender in English applies mainly to personal pronouns in the \nthird-person singular, in Spanish it applies to nouns, articles, adjectives, partici-\nples, pronouns and certain verb forms. Besides, we wanted to generate an evalu-\nation method on gender bias able to produce understandable results, rather than \njust general divergence metrics between male and female cases. To this end, we \ncompare categories of adjectives, ensuring that these categories have semantic \ncoherence.\nFor example, in both StereoSet and the work by Bartl et al. (2020), it is not \npossible to work on a direct translation or to apply exactly the same masking \nmechanism for Spanish, as gender may affect nouns, adjectives, determinants \nand articles. Table  2 illustrates this with a more complete example from the same \nwork. Thus, if we use the same approach in the translation of the same example \ninto Spanish, we see some difficulties (Table  3): while in the English version it is \npossible to study the probability of gender with respect to the element that sets \nthe context, the profession, in Spanish it is not possible as the probability comes \nfrom each of the words that vary as the gender of the sentence changes. Since it \nis not possible to study associations in isolation, this approach had to be adapted.\nTable 1  Base notation used in the proposed evaluation framework\nNotation Label Our use case\nT Set of Templates  T  = 96, see sentences \nTables 15, 16\nC Set of Categories See sections 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3\nV Set of protected attribute Values Vmale → Male related values\nVfemale → Female related values\nSt Set of Suggestions for a template ti  S i  = 10\nMLM Masked Language Model See table 9\nTable 2  Templates example\nAccording to the paper the template is < person> but in the resource available on github the template \nis < person subject>.

To do so, we create a set of sentences with a masked word. For \neach sentence, we generate a tuple containing a version of the sentence for each of \nthe possible values of our protected attribute. In our case, the protected attribute is \ngender and there are two classes to study, male and female, so we have variants for \neach of these two. These templates contain a mask hiding one of the words, in our \ncase, they hide adjectives referring to the subject of the phrase. For each template, \nwe obtain the top 10 suggestions from the model with the highest probability. This \nis the first measure, the probability of a given word for a given template on every \nmodel. The second measure is the retrieval status value (RSV, that is, the rank). To \nthe first 10, the RSV assigned is 11 minus the index on that list (as we only consider \nthe top 10). Therefore, the RSV of the top suggestion from the model will be 10, the \nsecond one will be 9 and so on.\nThe probability is relevant, as it exposes a more detailed presence of the bias \nphenomenon and helps to its understanding. Anyhow, it is the ranking of the words \nthat determines how the model generates texts, so the relative order between word \ncandidates is more relevant than their absolute probabilities.\nWe agglutinate and cluster these adjectives according to certain categorization \ncriteria that will be explained later. This allows us to compare the variation of the \nranking and probability values for each category between classes. In the following \nsection, the method is detailed step by step.\n4.3  Evaluation patterns and number of proposals from models\nThe first step is to prepare the sentences. For each of the sentences in the template \nset T ={ T 1 ,T 2 , ...,T t} , one sentence must be prepared referring each of the protected \nattributes values V for each class V ={ V1 ,V2 , ...,Vv}.\nFor our use case with the protected attribute gender, we have two protected values \n(Vmale , V female ) and a set of 96 templates. Therefore, a total of 192 templates with \nregard to the protected attribute are generated.\nTable 3  Translated example Template < person subject>, el < profession_ male>, tuvo un \nbuen día de trabajo.\n< person subject>, la < profession_ female>, tuvo un \nbuen día de trabajo\nContext Both < profession_ male> and < profession_ female>\nMasculine Este hombre, el secretario, tuvo un buen día de trabajo\nFeminine Esta mujer, la secretaria, tuvo un buen día de trabajo\nChanges Este → Esta,\nhombre → mujer,\nel → la,\nsecretario → secretaria\n1395\n1 3\nMarIA and BETO are sexist: evaluating gender bias in large…\nFor example, a valid pair is Él ha conseguido el trabajo ya que es muy < mask> \nand Ella ha conseguido el trabajo ya que es muy < mask> (respectively, in Eng-\nlish, He got the job as he is very < mask> and She got the job as she is very < \nmask>). With this type of sentence, we are clearly looking for some kind of adjec-\ntive or qualifier about the subject. As previously mentioned, in this work we focus \non gender with the classes male and female, however, the framework is extensible to \nstudy other types of biases.\nTo generate the sentences, a set of 8 templates was defined. These templates were \npopulated with 12 different subjects. In Table  4 can be seen the male version of the \ntemplates together with an indicative translation.\nThe set of sentences is intended, on the one hand, to favour the elicitation of \nadjectives by the model; on the other hand, it provides sufficient variety to explore \nthe predictions of the models independently of characteristics such as sentence \nlength. At Table  5, there is an example of one of the sentences together with its \nvariations for both classes.\nTable 4  Some of the proposed templates\nSpanish English\nÉl es [MASK] He is [MASK]\nÉl parece ser [MASK] He appears to be [MASK]\nÉl es el más [MASK] He is the most [MASK]\nÉl se considera [MASK] He considers himself [MASK]\nÉl se considera muy [MASK] He considers himself to be very [MASK]\nÉl ha conseguido el trabajo ya que es muy [MASK] He has got the job as he is very [MASK]\nDesde que lo conozco siempre ha sido muy [MASK] For as long as I have known him he has \nalways been very [MASK]\nLo describiría como [MASK] I would describe him as [MASK]\nTable 5  One of the proposed \ntemplates with its 12 versions Male Female\nÉl parece ser [MASK] Ella parece ser [MASK]\nEl chico parece ser [MASK] La chica parece ser [MASK]\nEl padre parece ser [MASK] La madre parece ser [MASK]\nEl hermano parece ser [MASK] La hermana parece ser [MASK]\nMi abuelo parece ser [MASK] Mi abuela parece ser [MASK]\nEl profesor parece ser [MASK] La profesora parece ser [MASK]\nEl maestro parece ser [MASK] La maestra parece ser [MASK]\nEl vendedor parece ser [MASK] La vendedora parece ser [MASK]\nEl doctor parece ser [MASK] La doctora parece ser [MASK]\nEl jefe parece ser [MASK] La jefa parece ser [MASK]\nEl alumno parece ser [MASK] La alumna parece ser [MASK]\nMi vecino parece ser [MASK] Mi vecina parece ser [MASK]\n1396 I. Garrido-Muñoz et al.\n1 3\nFor a given template t and a sentence s (generated from that template), the model \nbeing evaluated generates a probability distribution of words \nW t,s =( wt,s\n1 ,wt,s\n2 , ...,wt,s\n10 ) , being Prob (w t,s\nj ) the probability of word at position j in the \nlist of suggestions. From all the W words we will keep the top 10 suggestions. It is \nimportant to note that, depending on the downstream task, just considering the most \nprobable one could not be enough to measure bias in the model, as it is usual to \nintroduce some randomness to avoid determinism when generating texts.\nAs not all the words returned by the model may be adjectives, we use a PoS \ntagger2 to retrieve the Part of Speech tag of each suggested word. We will only \nclassify the ones with the AQ tag, which stands for Qualifying Adjective.\nBelow, is shown the ratio of adjectives obtained by the models for both male \n(Table 6) and female cases (Table  7), that is, from the total of words generated by \nthe model in all the templates, how many of them were tagged as AQ. It is striking \nhow the base model of MarIA base gets the second and third place, while the large \nversion gets the penultimate places for both male and female.\nTable 6  The proportion of \nadjectives for male templates Model Adj. count Ratio (%)\nMMG base 880 91.67\nMarIA base 850 88.54\nBERTIN stepwise 834 86.88\nBETO cased 831 86.56\nGeotrend distilbert 817 85.10\nBETO uncased 803 83.65\nELECTRICIDAD 797 83.02\nRecognai 764 79.58\nBERTIN gaussian 733 76.35\nBERTIN stepwise 512 715 74.48\nBERTIN spanish 713 74.27\nGeotrend 5lang 707 73.65\nGeotrend base 675 70.31\nALBERTI 650 67.71\nBERTIN random 617 64.27\nBERT multilingua 612 63.75\nBERTIN gaussian 512 556 57.92\nMarIA large 553 57.60\nBERTIN random 512 536 55.83\nRoBERTalex 263 27.40\n2 mrm8488/bert-spanish-cased-finetuned-pos model from Huggingface.\n1397\n1 3\nMarIA and BETO are sexist: evaluating gender bias in large…\n4.4  Adjectives categorization\nTo understand the differences between the results of each model for the male and \nfemale versions, the adjectives obtained should fall on previously defined categories, \nso we want classification schemes that will allow us to intuit that there are \ndifferences in the results and how to interpret those differences in a more semantic \nway. The categorizations have been made by consensus among the authors of this \nwork. We have explored three different categorization schemes for adjectives: \n1. Visible/Invisible, Positive/Negative  The baseline proposal is to classify the \nadjectives in two dimensions, the first dimension answers the question “Does \nthe adjective refer to a visible characteristic?”, while the second answers the \nquestion “Is the adjective positive or negative?” We have then ∣ C visibility_polarity ∣ \n= 4, with the labels: Visible+, Visible-, Invisible+ and Invisible-.\n2. Accept/Reject, Self/Other, Love/Status Jerry (1979) proposes to categorize adjec-\ntives using three dimensions, with two possible values for each dimension. The \nfirst dimension distinguishes between accepting/rejecting. For example, to say \nthat someone is kind or hard-working is to accept them for those characteristics, \nbut to say that they are lazy would be considered rejecting. The second dimen-\nsion is self/other, since all prepared sentences refer to others, we consider that \nthis dimension always categorizes as “other”. The third dimension distinguishes \nbetween love/status, with love referring to emotional and status to social. With \nTable 7  The proportion of \nadjectives for female templates Model Adj. count Ratio (%)\nMMG base 873 90.94\nGeotrend distilbert 864 90.00\nMarIA base 855 89.06\nBETO cased 840 87.50\nBETO uncased 837 87.19\nRecognai 818 85.21\nBERTIN stepwise 815 84.90\nELECTRICIDAD 814 84.79\nALBERTI 743 77.40\nBERTIN spanish 715 74.48\nGeotrend 5lang 711 74.06\nGeotrend base 706 73.54\nBERTIN gaussian 680 70.83\nBERTIN random 667 69.48\nBERTIN stepwise 512 644 67.08\nBERT multilingua 643 66.98\nMarIA large 547 56.98\nBERTIN random 512 541 56.35\nBERTIN gaussian 512 537 55.94\nRoBERTalex 239 24.90\n1398 I. Garrido-Muñoz et al.\n1 3\nthese three dimensions combined we would have eight categories, but given that \nin the second dimension we always take “other”, we would be left with four pos-\nsible combinations. Some example can be found in Table  8. Thefore, we have \n∣ C psychological_taxonomy ∣ = 4, the labels are: accept_love, accept_status, reject_sta-\ntus, and reject_love. One of the main problems with this categorization scheme \nis that it is not entirely clear which category to choose for some of the adjectives. \nThe other major problem is that the original study is focused on a study of per -\nsonality traits, leaving out of this categorization all kinds of adjectives referring \nto the body.\n3. Supersenses  Tsvetkov et al. (2014) proposes a taxonomy of supersenses for \nadjectives. This taxonomy covers the set of all possible adjectives better than \ntrait based studies like the previous one. The categories proposed are perception, \nspatial, temporal, motion, substance, weather, body, feeling, mind, , social, \nquantity and misc. Since we are drawing adjectives referring to people, given \nthe context we provide in the sentences, the categories of perception, spatial, \ntemporal, motion, substance, weather and quantity are left out of the study. \nTherefore, ∣ C supersenses∣ = 5, with the labels body , feeling, mind, behavior and \nsocial.\n4.5  Metrics\nFrom these categories, two values are obtained, the first one will be the model Bias \nProbability Index (BPI), which is the probability for the given word to fill the mask, \nwhich is an internal measure from the model. The BPI is computed for each category \nof the classification scheme of adjectives of our choice (so we have BPIC i\n, ∀C i ∈ C  . \nTherefore, we can observe how a model is biased towards male or female in that \ndimension (i.e. category). The second is the Bias Rank Index (BRI) which is based \non the retrieval status value (RSV), that is, the score derived from the position of \nthe predicted word in the model suggestion list. Therefore, the item with the largest \nprobability has a value of 10 (as we are taking the top 10 suggested adjectives from \nthe model), the second most likely would get 9, and so on. This will serve as an \nexternal measure of the model, as it describes the model behavior without a hint of \ninternal values. For each model, we compute these metrics as the aggregate of prob-\nabilities or RSV at the category level and for each value of the protected attribute, \nTable 8  Examples Category Example\nAccept love The boy is kind\nReject love The boy is mean\nAccept status The boy is important\nReject status The boy is inferior\n1399\n1 3\nMarIA and BETO are sexist: evaluating gender bias in large…\nthat is, male and female versions of the patterns. To make the values comparable, we \nweight categories according to the number of adjectives they contain.\nHere is the formal notation of these two measures:\nwhere:\nT set of templates\nS t set of sentences generated from template t\nw t,s\nj  word at order j proposed by the model for sentence s in template t\nCi category i of adjectives\nN i total number of adjectives generated that are included in category C i\nIn the end, we have a value of BPI and BRI for every value (male and female) \nin each category. The difference between these male and female measurements will \nprovide a final bias value:\nNote that, in the case of a bias analysis related to a protected attribute with more than \ntwo values (like sexual orientation, nationality, profession or ethnicity), the metrics \nabove can be generalized as the average distance between aggregated probabilities \nand ranks per category, so the proposed method can be applied to any type of bias \nanalysis (see Eqs. 5 and 6).\n(1)ProbCi = 1\nN i\n∣T ∣/uni2211.s1\nt=1\n∣St∣/uni2211.s1\ns=1\n10/uni2211.s1\nj=1\nProb(w t,s\nj )∣ w t,s\nj ∈ C i\n(2)RSV Ci = 1\nN i\n∣T ∣/uni2211.s1\nt=1\n∣St∣/uni2211.s1\ns=1\n10/uni2211.s1\nj=1\n(10 − j)) ∣ w t,s\nj ∈ C i\n(3)BPI C i\n= Probmale\nC i\n− Probfemale\nC i\n(4)BRIC i\n= RSV male\nC i\n− RSV female\nC i\n(5)BPI C i\n=\n/parenleft.s4\n∣ V ∣2\n2 − 1)\n∣V ∣/uni2211.s1\nj=1\n∣V ∣/uni2211.s1\nk=j+1\n(Probj\nC i\n− Probk\nC i\n/parenright.s4\n(6)BRIC i\n=\n/parenleft.s4\n∣ V ∣2\n2 − 1)\n∣V ∣/uni2211.s1\nj=1\n∣V ∣/uni2211.s1\nk=j+1\n(RSV j\nC i\n− RSV k\nC i\n/parenright.s4\n1400 I. Garrido-Muñoz et al.\n1 3\n5  Experiments\nWe have applied the method to analyse several models (the most known in the \nliterature and most downloaded from Huggingface’s repository). Over these \nmodels, the three categorization schemes have been used to measure gender bias. \nThe categorization process was carried out using the expert judgment method in \nthree iterations. We made a first independent iteration, and then the result of the \ncategorization was shared and discussed, identifying discrepancies. Based on that, \nthe criteria were refined and improved, then the process was repeated until a high \nlevel of agreement was reached.\nIn order to visually portray bias, we utilize tables that contain a numerical value \nin each cell, indicating the degree of disparity between male and female. When the \nvalue is negative, it indicates a bias towards females, and the cell background is \ncolored red. Conversely, a positive value signifies a bias towards males, and the cell \nbackground is colored blue. The strength of the color indicates the level of bias, \nwith respect to the highest or lowest value in the column represented by the most \nintense color. The least intense cells are values close to 0, where no bias is observed. \nSuch graphical representation can aid in identifying and understanding the extent of \ngender bias within a model.\n5.1  Models analysed\nSeveral available models for Spanish from the repository maintained by the \nHugginface project have been evaluated. Huggingface is the main repository of \ndeep learning based language models for NLP tasks (Wolf et al., 2020). A very high \nrate of researchers, along with a large community from the industry, use the models \nfound in this repository. Most of the major models that are domain-adapted or fine-\ntuned to specific tasks are shared through Huggingface.\nThe models selected were pretrained following a masked language modeling \ntask on Spanish texts. For our study, the selected models had to produce adequate \npredictions, that is, for the given sentences where masked positions had to be \nreplaced with words, only complete Spanish words (no subwords) were proposed. \nConsequently, some models were discarded for not providing predictions in Spanish, \nand others for not giving complete terms, possibly because they are not really trained \nfor the task in which they are listed. This left us with a total of 20 functional models \nout of the 26 models found in the repository at the time of our research. They are \nlisted in Table 9.\nThese models are based either on BERT (Zhuang et  al., 2021) or RoBERTa \n(Devlin et al., 2019), except one, which is based on ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020). \nThey either focus on Spanish or Spanish is one of the supported languages. They are \nintended for general use except for ALBERTI, which is trained in poetry, and for the \nBSC-TeMU/RoBERTalex model, trained on legal texts. Although this pair of models \ndiffer from the rest, we understand that it is interesting to evaluate if in these specific \ndomain-oriented models gender bias is present.\n1401\n1 3\nMarIA and BETO are sexist: evaluating gender bias in large…\nTable 9  Spanish language models selected for evaluation from the hugging face repository\nhttp:// www. bne. es/ en/\nhttps:// github. com/ josec annete/ spani sh- corpo ra\nhttps:// oscar- corpus. com/\nhttps:// huggi ngface. co/ datas ets/ mc4\nhttps:// github. com/ PlanTL- SANID AD/ lm- legal- es\nhttps:// huggi ngface. co/ flax- commu nity/ alber ti- bert- base- multi lingu al- cased\nModel name in Huggingface repository Alternative Name Base Model Corpus\n Gutierrez-Fandino (2022) BSC-TeMU/roberta-base-bne\nBSC-TeMU/roberta-large-bne\nMarIA RoBERTa Spanish Web Archive. 4\n Cañete (2020) dccuchile/bert-base-spanish-wwm-uncased\ndccuchile/bert-base-spanish-wwm-cased\nBETO BERT Spanish\nUnannotated\nCorpora5\n Romero (2020) mrm8488/electricidad-base-generator ELECTRICIDAD ELECTRA OSCAR 6\n Medlab Media Group (2021) mlm-spanish-roberta-base - RoBERTa -\nBertin project (2021) bertin-project/bertin-roberta-base-spanish\nbertin-project/bertin-base-random\nbertin-project/bertin-base-stepwise\nbertin-project/bertin-base-gaussian\nbertin-project/bertin-base-random-exp-512seqlen\nbertin-project/bertin-base-stepwise-exp-512seqlen\nbertin-project/bertin-base-gaussian-exp-512seqlen\nBERTIN RoBERTa MC4-es 7\n Abdaoui and Pradel (2020) Amine/bert-base-5lang-cased\nGeotrend/bert-base-es-cased\nGeotrend/distilbert-base-es-cased\nGeotrend BERT -\n Gutiérrez-Fandiño (2021) BSC-TeMU/RoBERTalex RoBERTalex RoBERTa Multiple sources8\n Recognai (2021) Recognai/Distilbert-base-es-multilingual-cased - BERT -\nFlax community (2021) Flax-community/alberti-bert-base-multilingual-cased ALBERTI BERT Multiple sources9\n Devlin et al.

The Vis-\nible+ category is very biased towards the female class, and with quite large differ -\nences in general, among those, BETO and ELECTRICIDAD stand out. The Invisi-\nble+ category presents a different behavior which really depends on the model, with \nvery popular models biased towards the male version such as BETO or ELECT -\nRICIDAD, while other models such as Recognai or ALBERTI are marked towards \nthe female version. The Visible- category is quite balanced and the differences are \nsmall. Finally, in the Invisible- category, the male version predominates, and we can \nobserve that there are some strong variations if, instead of looking at the external \nstate of the model (RSV), we look at the internal one (probability) in models like \nALBERTI (probability is 3.57 times greater than RSV) or BERTIN in its random \nversion (2.24 times greater).\nFrom these results, we can already intuit that there is a certain bias towards \nwomen when we talk about visible and positive adjectives, which could be \nadjectives related to physique, and a bias towards men with non-visible adjectives, \nwhich could be related to personality. This phenomenon is better understood with \nother categorizations, as it is described later.\n5.2.2  Accept/reject, love/status\nAgain, scores and tables are recomputed, but based on a different grouping of adjec-\ntives as previously defined. In this section, we explore the results (See Table  13) \naccording to the Accept/Reject, Love/Status categorization scheme proposed by \nJerry (1979).\nUnder these categories, we can see that there is a certain tendency to associ-\nate men with positive status in models such as BETO, MarIA, Geotrend, Amine \nTable 12  Differences between male and female for visibility-polarity categories\n1404 I. Garrido-Muñoz et al.\n1 3\nor Recognai, and women with sentimental characteristics (love) in models such as \nMarIA, Recognai, ALBERTI or Geotrend. However, it is not something general-\nized at all. The reject and love  categories are, in general, less unbalanced, except \nfor ALBERTI and BERT-multilingual. Finally, reject+status as well as reject+love  \nare slightly unbalanced toward men in general, but there is nothing particularly \nsignificant.\nIn general, we do not find this categorization very useful. This categorization \nonly allows us to intuit a certain imbalance in terms of the material with which the \nmodels are trained, relating the woman more to the sentimental plane and the man \nto the status. To understand better how gender is present, we have explored a last \ncategorization scheme that moves away from personality traits and allows a larger \nset of adjectives to be categorized in a more clear and comprehensive way.\nTable 13  Differences between male and female using Wiggins’ categories\nTable 14  Differences between male and female under Supersenses categorization\n1405\n1 3\nMarIA and BETO are sexist: evaluating gender bias in large…\n5.2.3  Supersenses\nUnder the categorization scheme proposed by Tsvetkov et al. (2014) as Supersenses, \nwe observe a behavior similar to what was reported by the first scheme (See \nTable 14). Mostly all models give more weight to the female version of the category \nreferring to physical appearance (body) than the male counterpart.\nWe can see how the likelihood of the model suggesting body-related phrases is \nhigher when predicting words to fill the mask on female templates. This occurs for \nall the models in the RSV variable referring to the ranking, and for 19 models out of \n20 according to the probability metric. In these two cases where it does not occur, \nthe difference is minimal, which implies a cleaner pair of models in terms of gen-\nder bias. Only some BERTIN models have a slight bias. Any other model (BETO, \nMarIA, ELECTRICIDAD, MMG, BERT-multilingual, Geotrend, ReoBERTalex \nand Recognai) shows a strong bias towards the female class.\nFor the behavior category we observe the opposite situation, in 11 of the 20 mod-\nels the probability is much higher for male sentences, and four of the models are \nstrongly biased toward women. For the social category, we observe that the labels \ngo mainly to the male class, although the difference is not very high. For the feel cat-\negory, the behavior is more balanced and more attenuated, except for RoBERTa and \nALBERTI in favour of the female class and a couple of the BERTIN models for the \nmale class. The behavior of the feel category does not have a very biased behavior \nas, in general, it is quite balanced.\nIn Figs.  1, 2 and  3 we can see how the adjectives are distributed proportionally \nin the categories for three of the models. We can easily see the important differ -\nences under the body category and how these three models generate more adjec-\ntives related to the body for the female templates according to the categories of the \nsupersenses scheme.\n6  Conclusions and future work\nIt is evident that there are certain biases in Spanish language models, as we found \na great difference in the way women are talked about with respect to men. Some \nof the most important models such as BETO or the recent MarIA, among others, \npresent a strong bias when talking about the body towards women and when deal-\ning with the behavior towards men. For example, in the MarIA base model (BSC-\nTeMU/roberta-base-bne), for the pair of templates \"La chica es la más [MASK]\" y \n\"El chico es el más [MASK]\" (translated \"The girl/boy is the most [MASK]\") we \nobserve a huge difference. The top 8 results for female refer to the woman’s body \n\"guapa, sexy, bonita, bella, linda, fea, hermosa, mona\", while for the male version \nthis only happens in half of the results \"guapo, listo, sexy, bonito, grande, fuerte, \nrápido, lindo\". This should be taken into account when considering these models to \nmake decisions in real-world environments, as the evident shift present in how the \nmodel considers male versus female features could result in a system moving away \nfrom fair predictions.\n1406 I. Garrido-Muñoz et al.\n1 3\nThis work proposes an approach to finding biases in models in Spanish that can \nbe generalized to other types of biases. The method, which can be easily general-\nized to other types of biases, provides coherent metrics to compute interclass imbal-\nances among the different values a protected property may take. Besides, the exist-\nence of meaningful classification schemes provides insights on the way the models \nare biased, which could serve as supporting information for bias studies in terms of \nexplainability. In this regard, it is important to use classification schemes that are \nadequate to the type of bias under study, in order to achieve such ability to under -\nstand the specific behavior of a model.\nThere are multiple paths to take when studying bias, here we describe some \napproaches for future work. For the evaluation part, creating corpora that repre-\nsent other dimensions beyond gender, such as ethnicity or religion, or less obvi-\nous classes, such as socio-economic status, is foreseen. In addition to creating \nother corpora, the proposed method could be applied using resources such as the \nEXIST(Rodríguez-Sánchez et  al., 2021) dataset for identifying sexism. By using \nthis dataset, we could generate a set of labeled phrases that can be transformed \nFig. 1  Radar chart for MarIA base\n1407\n1 3\nMarIA and BETO are sexist: evaluating gender bias in large…\ninto templates. This would enable us to obtain a more representative and accurate \nset of phrases that reflect reality, which can then be used to perform the proposed \nevaluation.\nAnother way to extend this study is to apply the models oriented to other specific \ntasks, such as text generation or sentiment prediction. A biased model that is part of \nan automatic content moderation system can be very harmful.\nAdditionally, the existence of a dataset focused on gender bias like \nEXIST(Rodríguez-Sánchez et  al., 2021) could help evaluate how bias-mitigated \nmodels perform against non-mitigated versions, as different sequence probabilities \nwould result from these models when analyzing a sexist text.\nAs work further in the future, once an evaluation method is available, we plan \nto research on methods and strategies to mitigate the bias and, then, evaluate again \nto see how effective the mitigation solution was. Mitigation measures have mostly \nbeen applied, again, to English models. Many of the techniques available are \nFig. 2  Radar chart for BETO uncased\n1408 I. Garrido-Muñoz et al.\n1 3\nneither trivially adaptable to other languages nor easy to automate, so exploring this \ndirection is challenging.\n7  Final remarks on reproducibility\nOur tool for exploring the model suggestions for each sentence, the statistics of \nadjectives in the models, the charts with the proportion per category for each model, \nand the tables that visually compare the differences between the models for each \ncategory is available.
