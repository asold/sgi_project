Microarray-based comparative genome hybridization (arrayCGH) or\ngenotyping arrays have been standard technologies to detect large regions subject to copy number changes in\ngenomes until most recently high-resolution sequence data can be analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS).\nDuring the last several years, NGS-based analysis has been widely applied to identify CNVs in both healthy and\ndiseased individuals. Correspondingly, the strong demand for NGS-based CNV analyses has fuelled development of\nnumerous computational methods and tools for CNV detection. In this article, we review the recent advances in\ncomputational methods pertaining to CNV detection using whole genome and whole exome sequencing data.\nAdditionally, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses and suggest directions for future development.\nBackground\nGenomic variation is comprised of single nucleotide var-\niants (SNVs), small insertions or deletions (indels), copy\nnumber variations (CNVs), and large structural variants\n(SVs); these variants range from single base changes to\nlarge chromosomal-level alterations [1]. CNV refers to a\ntype of intermediate-scale SVs with copy number\nchanges involving a DNA fragment that is typically\ngreater than one kilobases (Kb) and less than five mega-\nbases (Mb) [2]. The importance of CNVs was first recog-\nnized by their prevalence in healthy individuals [3,4]. It is\nestimated that approximately 12% of the genome in\nhuman populations is subject to copy number change [5].\nThese pervasive CNVs in the genome are thought to have\nequal contributions to genetic variation in humans as\nanother major type of variation, SNVs, which have long\nbeen considered the most abundant genetic variation in\nhumans [6]. So far, approximately half of the reported\nCNVs overlap with protein-coding regions [3]. These\ngains and losses of gene copies might directly influence\ngene dosage within the CNV regions, which could result\nin a change of gene expression level. Similar to SNVs,\nCNVs do not necessarily have a negative effect on human\nhealth. However, among the large number of CNVs,\nsome might have an association with, or directly involve\nin, diseases and phenotypes such as cancer and neuropsy-\nchiatric disorders [7,8]. Generally, CNVs include dele-\ntions, insertions, and duplications of genomic regions.\nBecause the lengths of CNVs vary greatly, the current\ncomputational tools usuall yt a r g e tas p e c i f i cr a n g eo f\nC N Vs i z e s .T h er e a d e r sm a yb ea w a r et h a tt h i sr e v i e w\nf o c u s e so na l lt y p e so fC N V si n c l u d i n gC N Ve v e n t sl e s s\nthan 1 Kb, intermediate structural variants greater than\n1 Kb, and large chromosomal events over 5 Mb.\nThe traditional approach to identify CNVs employs\ncytogenetic technologies, such as karyotyping and fluor-\nescence in situ hybridization (FISH) [9]. In 2003,\ngenome-wide detection of CNVs was achieved using\nmore accurate array-based comparative genomic hybridi-\nzation (arrayCGH) and single-nucleotide polymorphism\n* Correspondence: zhongming.zhao@vanderbilt.edu\n1Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University School of\nMedicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nZhao et al.

Since 2005, several commercial plat-\nforms, including those from 454 Life Sciences, Illumina,\nInc., and Life Technologies, have increased read genera-\ntion throughput and base-calling accuracy unprecedent-\nedly, enabling the sequencing of a whole human genome\nat a much lower cost and a faster turnaround time [12].\nCompared to array-based approaches, where probes are\npredefined for limited genomic regions, short reads from\nNGS platforms are randomly sampled from the entire\ngenome. The advantages of the NGS approach also\ninclude higher coverage and resolution, more accurate\nestimation of copy numbers, more precise detection of\nbreakpoints, and higher capability to identify novel CNVs\n[1,14]. Taking these advantages into account, a diverse\nset of tools has been developed to detect CNVs based on\ndifferent features that can be extracted from NGS data.\nTo provide guidelines for the rapidly growing number of\nCNV studies using NGS, this review presents a systematic\ninvestigation of the 37 currently available tools, which dif-\nfer in computational strategies to pinpoint CNVs in whole\ngenome sequencing (WGS) data. In addition, 11in silico\ntools specific to whole exome sequencing (WES) data are\ndiscussed separately due to the challenges unique to CNV\ndetection in WES data. Based on the discussion of the\nfunctions and limitations of current CNV-calling tools,\nand perspectives for future development, we mainly focus\non: (i) the key features for CNV calling tools using NGS\ndata, (ii) the key factors to consider before pipeline design,\nand (iii) developing combinatorial approach for more\naccurate CNV calling.\nFive strategies for CNV detection through\nNGS data\nMany SV-detecting methods can be applied to CNV\nidentification. So far, the NGS based CNV detection\nmethods can be categorized into five different strategies,\nincluding: (1) paired-end mapping (PEM), (2) split read\n(SR), (3) read depth (RD), (4)de novo assembly of a gen-\nome (AS), and (5) combination of the above approaches\n(CB) (Figure 1). Indeed, different strategies have their\nown advantages and limitations. Though there has been\ngreat progress in each category, none of the methods\ncould comprehensively detect all types of CNVs. As sum-\nmarized in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, there are 6 PEM-based tools,\n4 SR-based tools, 26 RD-based tools, 3 AS-based tools,\nand 9 tools for combinatorial approaches. Most PEM-,\nSR-, and CB-based tools are not specific to CNV detec-\ntion but rather for SV identification, while the majority of\nRD- and AS-based tools are developed for the detection\nof CNVs instead of SVs. From the point of input materi-\nals, a majority (28) of the 48 tools listed in Tables 1, 2, 3,\n4 accept SAM or BAM files as input. Specifically, most\nRD-based tools start from SAM/BAM files with depth\ninformation, while PEM- and SR-based tools can accept\nFASTQ files since they may not use read depth informa-\ntion. Among these tools, 32 were implemented using R\nand/or C/C++ computer languages, as they are conveni-\nent in incorporating statistical models, improving com-\nputational efficiency, and dis tributing across multiple\noperating systems. Note that most of these tools are stan-\ndalone instead of online tools, except for visualization.\nPaired-end mapping approach\nThe feasibility of using NGS data to detect SVs/CNVs was\nfirst achieved by PEM methods [15]. To date, six tools\nwere developed specifically based on PEM (Table 1). In\naddition, at least 8 CB tools incorporate PEM algorithms\nto improve accuracy (Table 4). Notably, PEM is only\napplicable to paired-end reads but not single-end reads\n[15]. In paired-end sequencing, the DNA fragments from\nthe same library preparation protocol have a specific dis-\ntribution of the insert size. PEM identifies SVs/CNVs from\ndiscordantly mapped paired-reads whose distances are sig-\nnificantly different from the predetermined average insert\nsize (Figure 1a). PEM methods can efficiently identify not\nonly insertions and deletions but also mobile element\ninsertions, inversions, and tandem duplications. However,\nPEM is not applicable to insertion events larger than the\naverage insert size of the genome library [16]. Another\nlimitation of PEM is its inability to detect CNVs in low-\ncomplexity regions with segmental duplication.\nTwo different strategies have been used in PEM-based\ntools to detect SVs/CNVs, namely the clustering approach\nand the model-based approach. The difference lies in that\nthe clustering approach employs a predefined distance to\nidentify discordant reads, while the model-based approach\nadopts a probability test to discover the unusual distance\nbetween read pairs in comparison to the distance distribu-\ntion in genome. For the clustering approach, a cluster\noften includes at least two read pairs (Figure 1a), which is\nthe minimal requirement to ensure the accuracy of the\npredication of breakpoints and the SV/CNV sizes [16].\nThe tool BreakDancer provides both clustering-based and\nmodel-based approaches to detect various SVs [17]: its\nmodule BreakDancerMax is clustering-based while the\nother module, BreakDancerMini, uses a model-based\napproach to detect smaller insertions and deletions ran-\nging from 10- to 100-base pairs (bps). PEMer is another\ntool that uses a clustering-based strategy to detect\nZhao et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14(Suppl 11):S1\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/S11/S1\nPage 2 of 16\nSVs [18]. It implements various cluster sizes to guide read\nclustering and uses a customized cutoff to detect discor-\ndant read pairs. The advantage of PEMer is that the read\nclusters obtained from different platforms and different\nparameterizations can be merged together.\nBoth BreakDancer and PEMer are based on the hard\ncluster method. That is, each read can only be assigned to\none cluster, and the reads that can be mapped to multiple\ngenomic coordinates are discarded, even if they are\nmapped with high quality. Because of this limitation, it is\nnot feasible to detect SVs/CNVs in repetitive genomic\nregions. To overcome this, V ariationHunter [19] was\ndeveloped by introducing a soft clustering strategy, which\nallows short reads in multiple clusters, aiming to improve\nsensitivity. It proposes two algorithms to implement soft\nclustering of the discordant reads: VariationHunter-SC\n(Set Cover) and VariationHunter-Pr (Probabilistic). Using\nmaximum parsimony, VariationHunter-SC can minimize\nthe total number of genomic clusters by mapping each\npaired-end read to a particular SV. VariationHunter-Pr\nFigure 1 Five approaches to detect CNVs from NGS short reads. A. Paired-end mapping (PEM) strategy detects CNVs through discordantly\nmapped reads. A discordant mapping is produced if the distance between two ends of a read pair is significantly different from the average\ninsert size. B. Split read (SR)-based methods use incompletely mapped read from each read pair to identify small CNVs. C. Read depth (RD)-based\napproach detects CNV by counting the number of reads mapped to each genomic region. In the figure, reads are mapped to three exome\nregions. D. Assembly (AS)-based approach detects CNVs by mapping contigs to the reference genome. E. Combinatorial approach combines RD\nand PEM information to detect CNVs.\nZhao et al.

N/A N/A N/A RD+SR [74]\naRD: read depth-based approach; PEM: paired-end mapping approach; SR: split read approach; AS:de novo assembly approach.\nZhaoet al.BMC Bioinformatics2013,14(Suppl 11):S1\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/S11/S1\nPage 7 of 16\nwas developed to solve the problems present when the\nsame paired end reads are mapped to multiple locations\nwith equal support. Additionally, VariationHunter was\nextended to detect transposon insertion events from NGS\ndata recently [20].\nAside from the single sample-based PEM algorithm, a\nmultiple samples-based PEM algorithm was also imple-\nmented in commonLAW [21], a software that compares\nall the samples to a reference genome simultaneously to\nobtain more accurate SVs. Similar to VariationHunter-SC,\ncommonLAW implements a maximum parsimony\napproach to detect SVs/CNVs. In other words, common-\nLAW works like a multiple alignment tool if we consider\nVariationHunter as a pairwise alignment method in this\nanalogy.\nSplit read-based approach\nSR methods start from read pairs in which one read\nfrom each pair is aligned to the reference genome\nuniquely while the other one fails to map or only par-\ntially maps to the genome (Figure 1b). Those unmapped\nor partially mapped reads potentially provide accurate\nbreaking points at the single base pair level for SVs/\nCNVs. SR methods split the incompletely mapped reads\ninto multiple fragments. The first and last fragments of\neach split read are then aligned to the reference genome\nindependently. This remapping step therefore provides\nthe precise start and end positions of the insertion/dele-\ntion events. However, the SR-based approach heavily\nrelies on the length of reads and is only applicable to\nthe unique regions in the reference genome.\nPindel is the first SR-based method to identify break-\npoints of large deletions (1 bp - 10 Kb) and medium-sized\ninsertions (1 - 20 bps) [22]. Starting with unmapped or\npartially mapped reads from read pairs, this tool utilizes a\nstring match approach to search unique substrings in\nminimum (the 5’ end of the input reads) and maximum\nlocations (the 3’ e n do ft h ei n p u tr e a d s )i nw h i c hb o t h\ncould be completely mapped to the genome. Based on the\nminimum and maximum location, the reads are split into\neither two (deletion) or three (short intra-read insertion\nfragment in the middle) segments. Another SR-based tool,\nAlignment with Gap Excision (AGE), identifies SV break-\npoints with base pair accuracy using more strict align-\nments with gap excision [23]. Using a local alignment\nalgorithm similar to Smith-Waterman [24], AGE can\nsimultaneously align two sequences accurately. Since this\ntool requires a predefined SV/CNV region as input to\nguide local alignment, it provides a complementary strat-\negy to other tools in identifying SVs/CNVs. Similarly, the\nSR-based tool split-read identification, calibrated (SRiC),\nadopts gapped alignment to detect SVs [25]. Lastly,\nanother SR-based tool, SLOPE, was developed for targeted\nsequencing data of a limited number of genomic regions\nof interest [26] (Table 1).\nRead depth-based approach\nMainly due to the accumulation of high-coverage NGS\ndata, RD-based methods have recently become a major\napproach to estimate copy numbers. The underlying\nhypothesis of RD-based me t h o d si st h a tt h ed e p t ho f\ncoverage in a genomic regi on is correlated with the\ncopy number of the region, e.g., a gain of copy number\nshould have a higher intensity than expected [27]. Com-\npared to PEM and SR-based tools, RD-based methods\ncan detect the exact copy numbers, which the former\napproaches are lacking because PEM/SR methods only\nuse the position information. Moreover, RD-based\nmethods can detect large insertions and CNVs in com-\nplex genomic region classes, which are difficult to detect\nusing PEM and SR methods [28].\nCurrently, WGS and WES are the two major NGS plat-\nforms for DNA-sequencing (DNA-seq). WGS can deter-\nmine the full spectrum of variants in the whole genome.\nWES is a more effective, targeted sequencing of protein\ncoding regions in the genome, often with high coverage.\nIn this section, we review the RD-based tools for WGS\nand WES separately, as they utilize different technologies\nand produce different data. However, both platforms gen-\nerate similar raw data in the format of short reads and\ninvolve the mapping of short reads to the reference gen-\nome. The mapping results are then used to calculate read\ndepth in both WGS and WES.\nGenerally, RD-based tools can be classified into three\ncategories depending on the study design: single samples,\npaired case/control samples, and a large population of\nsamples. When there is only a single sample, it is not\npossible to borrow information from other samples or\nthe matched control. Therefore, a widely applied strategy\nin such cases is to estimate the read depth distribution\nusing mathematical models and to discover regions with\nabnormal depth departing from the overall distribution.\nThe copy numbers reported in such cases are more likely\nto be absolute numbers of copies. When there are pairs\nof matched samples, CNV detection can be leveraged on\nthe matched control, which could serve as a“reference ”\ngenome. The copy numbers in such cases are reported\nmore like relative copies compared to the reference con-\ntrol, instead of absolute copie s .F i n a l l y ,t od e t e c tC N V s\nfrom a population of samples, tools are developed using\nthe overall mean of the read depth from multiple samples\nto discover the discordant copy numbers in each sample.\nBasically, RD-based methods follow a four-step proce-\ndure to discover CNVs: mapping, normalization, estima-\ntion of copy number, and segmentation (Figure 1c). In\nthe mapping step, short reads are aligned to the reference\nZhao et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14(Suppl 11):S1\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/S11/S1\nPage 8 of 16\ngenome, and the read depth is calculated according to\nthe number of mapped reads in predefined windows. The\nsecond step focuses on normalization and correction of\npotential biases in read depths mainly caused by GC con-\ntents and repeat genomic regions, among others. With\nthe normalized read depths, the third step is to estimate\nthe accurate copy number along the chromosome to\ndetermine the gain or loss. Lastly, the genomic regions\nwith a similar copy number are merged to detect discor-\ndant copy number regions [29]. Notably, after mapping\nand normalization, the read depth data from NGS experi-\nments are similar to the probe log ratios from arrayCGH\ndata in the mathematical view. Therefore, some classical\nalgorithms to detect CNV regions from arrayCGH data\ncan be reused and modified to work on NGS read depth\ndata.\nTools for whole genome sequencing data\nGenerally, RD-based tools define non-overlapping geno-\nmic windows, calculate read depths for these windows,\nand estimate copy numbers for each of them. Deeper read\ndepth can not only increase the statistical power of CNV\ndetection, but also help to infer the best size of a sliding\nwindow [30]. A moving window with a fixed width is the\ns i m p l e s tw a yt od i v i d eac h r o m o s o m e[ 3 1 ] .H o w e v e r ,\nsome genomic regions with a small read count may create\na non-uniform fluctuant, which may result in high false\npositive detection. In CNAnorm, the authors suggested\nchoosing the best size for sliding windows so that the\nnumber of reads mapped to each window is between 30\nand 180 for WGS data [32]. Based on a user-defined false\ndiscovery rate (FDR), ReadDepth and mrCaNaVar can\nautomatically set an appropriate size for a sliding window\naccording to the mean number of reads in each window.\nRDXplorer proposed a novel algorithm using significance\ntesting called EWT (Event-Wise Testing), which provides\na high resolution for CNV detection using 100-bp win-\ndows [28]. A Z-score is calculated based on the number of\nreads mapped in each 100-bp window, according to a two-\ntailed normal distribution. Using a probabilistic approach,\nEWT was implemented to search unusual depth intervals\nwith deletion and insertion events using corrected\nZ-scores. The tool SegSeq requires a predefined amount\nof reads mapped in a genomic window [33]. Similar to\nSegSeq, recursive Smith-Waterman-seq (rSW-seq) was\ndeveloped for CNV detection in matched tumor-control\nsamples [34]. Different from SegSeq, rSW-seq does not\nrely on predefined genomic windows. It first sorts reads\naccording their genomics regions. Next, positive and nega-\ntive weight values are assigned to tumor and control sam-\nples, respectively. The cumulative changes of assigned\nweight values are used to determine breakpoints that indi-\ncate copy number gains or losses.\nAnother key challenge for RD-based CNV detection is\nan efficient algorithm to segment the detected CNV\nregions after choosing the appropriate sliding window.\nEarlier methods such as mrCaNaVar and CNV-seq are\nimplemented in a model-free style [31,35,36]. After\nobtaining the read depth, mrCaNaVar directly localizes\nsegments with significantly different read depths to the\noverall read depth mean. The segments with three times\nthe standard deviation over the mean of read depth are\ndetermined as duplication events. Similar criteria are\napplied to deletions. However, this model-free approach\ntends to have a high FDR even after correcting for GC-\ncontent and mapping biases.\nMost of the methods use statistical models, such as\nCircular Binary Segmentation (CBS), Mean Shift-Based\n(MSB), Shifting Level Model (SLM), Expectation Maximi-\nzation (EM), and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for\nCNV detection (Table 2). These models assume that\nthere is a sequence of segments (gain or loss) along each\nchromosome that could be detected using probability dis-\ntribution functions with statistical measurements, such as\nthe mean and variances of read depths. Compared with\nmode-free approach, appro aches using mathematical\nmodels to detect CNVs generate more reliable results\nafter filtering false positive regions.\nThe CBS method was originally developed for arrayCGH\ndata to convert the noisy intensities into segments with\nequal copy numbers. Essentially, the algorithm recursively\nlocalizes the breakpoints by changing genomic positions\nuntil the chromosomes are divided into segments with\nequal copy numbers that are significantly different from\nthe copy numbers from their adjacent genomic regions\n[37]. The first tool to introduce CBS in NGS data is\nSegSeq [33], which uses a case (e.g., cancer) versus control\ndataset to detect CNVs. At first, the copy number ratio of\nthe two matched samples is calculated for each genomic\nwindow. Using the CBS algorithm, SegSeq identifies the\nboundaries of DNA fragments with changed copy num-\nbers. ReadDepth is another RD-based CNV calling tool\nthat uses the CBS approach to segment chromosomes\n[38]. However, it does not require paired samples; rather,\nit can be applied to a single sample. Notably, ReadDepth is\nable to discover epigenetic changes due to its capacity to\nprocess both regular and bisulfite-treated reads [38].\nMSB [39] is another widely applied algorithm that was\noriginally developed for CNV segmentation in arrayCGH\ndata. In the MSB approach, the adjacent genomic win-\ndows with similar read depths are merged together along\nchromosomes. The breakpoints are reported when read\ndepths of a sliding window aresignificantly discordant\nwith the depths of the merged windows. Two software\ntools for NGS data, CNVnator [40] and BIC-seq [41],\nimplement the MSB approach to choose the window size\nfor read depth signal partitioning. CNVnator works on\nsingle individual samples to implement MSB. The key\nfeature of CNVnator is its capability to detect CNVs in\nZhao et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14(Suppl 11):S1\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/S11/S1\nPage 9 of 16\nvarious sizes ranging from a few hundred bases to mega-\nbases. In contrast, BIC-seq, which also implements the\nMSB approach, works on matched pair samples instead\nof single samples [41].\nCNVeM is a recently developed tool to determine\nCNVs from individual samples with all possible mapping\ninformation [42]. It utilizes mrsFAST to map reads,\nallowing up to 2 mismatches [43]. Those ambiguously\nmapped reads within each 300-bp window are used to\nestimate copy numbers using an EM algorithm. Instead\nof searching CNVs in a genomic region, the copy num-\nber of each base is calculated based on its mapped\nreads. Therefore, this algorithm can predict breakpoints\nin base pair resolution. Due to its ambiguous mapping\nstrategy, CNVeM is also useful to distinguish the gain\nor loss for human paralog regions.\nCNAseg is a representative tool utilizing HMM in the\nsegmentation step to identify contiguous genomic regions\nwith similar read depths [44]. The key feature of CNAseg\nis its powerful framework to control the false positive rate\nusing read depth variability between different flow cells\nfrom case and control samples. JointSLM is another tool\nclustering the small abnormal genomic regions using an\nHMM approach [45]. However, JointSLM does not rely on\nsingle or paired samples but builds a statistical model\nbased on multiple samples. Taking advantage of the simul-\ntaneous analyses of multiple samples, JointSLM works bet-\nter than the EWT algorithm implemented in RDXplorer\n[28] in terms of detecting small CNV regions as short as\n500 bp. In addition, higher sensitivity can be achieved by\nJointSLM with more samples [45].\nJointSLM is not the only tool to utilize multiple sam-\nples to detect CNVs. Two additional tools, cn.MOPS and\ncorrelation matrix diagonal segmentation (CMDS), are\nproposed to increase statistical power and decrease com-\nputational burden based on a multiple samples approach.\ncn.MOPS proposed a data processing pipeline using a\nmixture of Poisson models to reduce the FDR in CNV\ndetection [46]. By modelling read depths across multiple\nsamples in each genomic region, this tool can remove the\neffect of read depth variation along chromosomes.\nAnother multiple sample-based tool, CMDS, was devel-\noped to identify CNVs using a between-chromosomal-\nsite correlation analysis [47]. CMDS initially takes all\ncopy numbers from the same genomic regions from mul-\ntiple samples as input. The correlation coefficients\nbetween two different genomic regions across multiple\nsamples are calculated. The diagonal transformation and\nstatistical tests are applied on the correlation coefficients\nto identify focal events (CNVs). Though CNVnator also\nclaims its ability to discover CNVs from families and\npopulations, it calls CNVs in each sample before the\ncross-sample comparison [40]. Compared with other\ntools, multiple sample-based tools often gain high sensi-\ntivity and a lower false positive rate [46].\nThe different RD-based tools have their own limita-\ntions and advantages. In a recent comparison of different\nRD-based tools [29], EWT-based methods (e.g.,\nRDxplorer) and SLM-based methods (e.g., JointSLM)\nshowed the best performance with both high sensitivity\nand specificity. For large windows over 50 bp, the CBS-\nbased tool (ReadDepth) and MSB-based tool (CNVnator)\nperformed well, but their accuracy was decreased when\ndealing with smaller windows less than 10 bp. The HMM\nbased tool, CNASeg, could obtain better CNV calling on\nhigh coverage data but performs worse on low coverage\ndata. In terms of the size of detected CNVs, RDxplorer\ncould detect CNVs with a length of ~500 bp. However,\nReadDepth and CNVnator can identify larger events ran-\nging between 2-5 Kb.\nTools for CNV detection through WES data\nDue to investigators’ interest in coding gene regions and\nits lower cost, WES is widely applied to Mendelian as well\nas other complex diseases [48]. WES has the potential to\nrapidly detect single nucleotide mutations and CNVs in\nhuman coding regions. The inherent limitation of WES is\nthat it produced reads only covering 1-2% of the human\ngenome based on the currently available exome extraction\nkits. The full spectrum of CNVs and breakpoints may not\nbe completely characterized. In addition, many large\nCNVs and cross-chromosome events may not be detected.\nNevertheless, CNV detection based on WES data may give\na quick insight into CNV patterns for a specific disease or\nphenotype. The analysis tools reviewed below may help\nestablish rational pipelines to identify various CNVs in\nmatched case-control pairs, multiple disease samples, and\ncommon CNVs in large populations.\nIn contrast to WGS, WES data have higher depth for\ntargeted regions, which is ideal for more accurate CNVs\nusing an RD-based calling approach. However, due to dif-\nfering capture efficiency, the depth from different genomic\nregions may vary substantially and should be considered\nin the downstream analysis of CNV calling. First, due to\ninconsistent capture efficiency, there might be regions that\nare poorly sequenced, which requires pre-processing for\nWES data. Second, the assumption of normal distribution\nmay no longer be valid due to the biases regarding read\ndepth distribution. Third, due to the discontinuation of\ngenomic regions, most CNV breakpoints could not be\ndetected. Finally, the widely applied segmentation algo-\nrithms to merge windows in WGS may not be applicable\nin WES data due to the non-continuous distributions of\nthe reads.\nTo keep pace with the flood of WES data, at least 11\nRD-based CNV calling tools have been developed to\naddress the unique challenges of WES data (Table 3).\nZhao et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14(Suppl 11):S1\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/S11/S1\nPage 10 of 16\nSimilar to the methods for WGS data, the methods for\nWES data may also rely on matched case and control\nsamples or single samples to detect discordant CNV\nprofiles [49]. ExomeCNV focuses on regions whose cov-\nerage is higher than a predefined minimum depth and\nassumes Gaussian distribution to characterize the read\ndepth from WES. Similarly, VarScan 2 requires a mini-\nmum coverage of 3× for each captured region from\nWES data to reduce potential false positives [50]. Based\non the relative CNVs between the case and control sam-\nples, VarScan 2 adopts a CBS algorithm implemented by\nDNAcopy [51] for segmentation. Unlike directly model-\nling the log-ratios of the coverage between case and\ncontrol samples for each region, the tool PropSeq imple-\nments a regression model to represent the read depth of\nag i v e nr e g i o ni nt h ec a s es a m p l ea saf u n c t i o no fi t s\ncounterpart in the control sample [52].\nRecently, in the work of ExomeDepth, the authors\nargued that the Gaussian assumptions may not comple-\ntely characterize the read count from WES data due to\nthe technical noise from library preparation, capture,\nand sequencing. Rather, ExomeDepth shows that the\nbeta-binomial model could fit WES data better than the\nGaussian model. In addition, because the ExomeDepth\ndoes not rely on the CNVs in the reference sample, it is\nuseful in the detection of rare CNVs [30]. Another flex-\nible tool, Control-FREEC, is able to call CNVs from\nW G Sa n dW E Sd a t aw i t ho rw i t h o u tc o n t r o ls a m p l e s\n[53]. An additional convenience of Control-FREEC is its\nacceptance of almost all available formats currently used\nin NGS data rather than being limited to SAM/BAM\nfiles.\nAll the above CNV detection methods are designed to\ndetect CNVs from NGS data for small-scale samples,\npaired or not, and are especially prevalent for cancer and\nnormal pairs. Another scenario in WES data is separate,\nlarge-scale sequencing of a disease population and a con-\ntrol population. Similar to the trends in CNV calling for\nWGS data, more and more tools utilize multiple samples\nwith WES data to increase sensitivity and reduce the\nFDR. These tools, such as CoNIFER (copy number infer-\nence from exome reads), XHMM (exome hidden Markov\nmodel), and ExoCNVTest, fit particularly well for high-\nresolution and large population-based studies to detect\nrare and common CNVs. CoNIFER was the first devel-\noped to deal with rare CNVs from multiple samples [54].\nIt starts by calculating the average signal intensity for\neach captured region in each of the samples. Using the\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) approach, CoNIFER\nnormalized absolute copy numbers from each sample to\ndiscover rare CNVs. At almost the same time as CoNI-\nFER was released, another group reported the tool\nXHMM, which adopts a similar concept to normalize\nthe raw read depth data but uses principal-component\nanalysis (PCA) [55]. Following the recalibration of read\ndepth, XHMM implements an HMM model to find the\nsignificant discordant CNVs. Both tools utilize a large\nsample size to detect CNVs while reducing potential\ntechnical noises from exome capture reactions and batch\neffects by removing the major variances detected in SVD\nor PCA. The main advantages of these two methods\ninclude that they are control-free and can be applied to\nlarge disease cohorts. To date, ExoCNVTest is the only\ntool to specifically detect common CNVs from WES data\n[56]. After normalizing the read depth, ExoCNVTest cal-\nculates the local first principal component (FPC) on the\nread depth for each sample. Then, the local FPCs are\nused to discover the global principal components, which\nmay record the CNV information. The association\nbetween global principal components and particular\ngenomic regions is carried out to detect the absolute\ncopy number genotypes with case-control samples.\nAssembly-based approach\nDifferent from the RD, PEM and SR approaches that first\nalign NGS reads to a known reference genome before the\ndetection of CNVs, the AS-based methods first recon-\nstruct DNA fragments, i.e.,contigs, from short reads by\nassembling overlapping reads. By comparing the\nassembled contigs to the reference genome, the genomic\nregions with discordant copy numbers are then identified\n(Figure 1d). This direct assembly of short reads without\nusing a reference is calledde novo assembly. Assembly\ncan also use a reference genome as a guide to improve its\ncomputational efficiency and contig quality. AS-based\nmethods have a minimum read coverage requirement to\nsatisfy the algorithm and detect overlapping fragments,\nalthough high coverage will increase the complexity of\nshort read assembly, especially for de novo AS-based\ntools.\nThe Cortex assembler was designed as a completede\nnovo CNV calling method [57]. It uses de Bruijn graphs\nto assemble overlapped reads from multiple sequencing\nsamples into a single graph. The nodes and edges in the\ngraph are marked in different colors to differentiate dif-\nferent samples. Then, it discovers CNVs by piping all\nthe nodes from different samples together to find bifurca-\ntion structures, in which the sequence of the sample dif-\nfers from the sequence of the reference genome. The\nbranches to separate differentcolors represent SVs, e.g.,\ninsertions and deletions. Anotherde novo AS-based tool,\nMagnolya, that was published recently, also estimates\ncopy numbers from two or more samples by utilizing a\nPoisson mixture model [58].\nWithout relying on read alignment, the AS methods\npotentially provide an unbiased approach to discover\nnovel genetic variants ranging from the single base pair\nlevel to large structure variation. However, AS methods\nZhao et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14(Suppl 11):S1\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/S11/S1\nPage 11 of 16\nare rarely used in CNV detection in non-human eukar-\nyotic genomes due to the low quality of the assembled\ncontigs and their overwhelming demand on computa-\ntional resources.\nThe combinatorial approach\nAlthough there has been great progress in each of the\nfour categories of PEM, SR, RD, and AS approaches, and\na growing number of tools have been developed, none of\nthem have been able to detect the full spectrum of all\ntypes of CNVs with high sensitivity and specificity. With\ndistinct advantages and weaknesses, these four strategies\ncould be complementary to each other. PEM-based\nmethods can detect all types of SVs (e.g., deletion, novel\ninsertion, translocation, inversion, interspersed and tan-\ndem duplication) [59], especially for deletions of less than\n1 Kb. However, PEM tools cannot accurately estimate\nthe actual numbers of copies, and they are not applicable\nto insertions larger than the average insert size of the\nlibrary. In contrast, RD-based methods can accurately\npredict copy numbers, have good performance to detect\nlarge CNVs, and are applicable to both WGS and WES\ndata. However, they are not applicable for detection of\nprecise breakpoints, copy neutral events like inversions\nor translocations, or small CNVs (e.g., <1 Kb). For the\nAS-based tools, their exclusive advantage lies in that they\ndo not require a reference genome as input, and, impor-\ntantly, they allow the discovery of novel mutation\nsequences. However, AS-based tools require extensive\ncomputation and perform poorly on repeat and duplica-\ntion regions. For the SR-based tools, they could detect\nbreakpoints at base pair resolution and performed well\non deletion and small insertions. However, SR-based\ntools have low sensitivity in regions with low-complexity,\nas they rely on unique mapping information to the gen-\nome. To overcome the inherent limitations and take\nadvantage of different types of methods, a number of\ntools have been developed attempting to integrate multi-\nple approaches from different categories to increase the\nperformance in detecting CNVs and reduce false positive\ndiscoveries.\nFive tools in Table 4 are able to use PEM and RD infor-\nmation to identify CNVs in populations, including SVDe-\ntect [60], CNVer [61], Genome STRiP [62], GASVPro\n[63], and inGAP-sv [64]. As aforementioned, combinator-\nial methods can take advantage of the uniqueness of mul-\ntiple tools and, thus, can reduce more false positives than\nany method that is purely built on PEM or RD (Figure 1e).\nFor example, PEM methods can report accurate break-\npoints, but their efficiency is low when detecting large\nCNV regions (e.g., insertions longer than the insert size)\nor counting exact copy numbers. On the other hand, RD\nmethods are advantageous to detect large CNVs but can-\nnot report exact breakpoints. A combination of the two\nwould enable accurate detection of CNV regions with\nexact breakpoints and spanning various lengths, especially\nfor longer insertions that are undetectable by PEM. In\naddition, the independent identification of CNV regions\nhelps the tools to reduce false positives.\nSVDetect is the first tool to introduce read depth infor-\nmation to improve PEM-based detection of large SVs.\nCombining the breakpoint predicted by the PEM approach\nand the log-ratio from the read depth between the\nmatched case and control samples, the tool makes final\njudgements on gain and loss events. CNVer is another\ntool that combines PEM and read depth information for\nCNV identification [61]. Similar to SVDetect, CNVer\nmakes use of discordant read pair mapping information to\nidentify breakpoints and read depth signals to identify\naberrant genomic fragments. Notably, an additional advan-\ntage of CNVer is that it employed an ambiguous mapping\nstrategy to allow better use of the reads that are mapped\nto multiple genomic locations. In this way, higher sensitiv-\nities in repeat and duplication regions can be achieved by\nCNVer. Genome STRiP is used to identify SVs/CNVs in\nlarge populations such as the date generated in The 1000\nGenome Project [62]. To reduce false positives in deletion\nidentification, the tool requires that the deletion identified\nby the PEM approach should also be confirmed by the\nlower read depth in the same genomic regions.\nThe GASV-Pro is another successful example of a\ncombinatorial method. It was upgraded from a single\nPEM-based tool, GASV (Geometric Analysis of Struc-\ntural Variants), and incorporated read depth information\nto combinatorially call CNVs. GASV proposed a novel\ngeometric approach to cluster the discordant mappings\nfrom paired reads [65]. In this approach, the breakpoint\nregion is represented as a polygon in a plane. This tool\ncan further identify the accurate boundary supporting\nthe same variant using an efficient plane sweep algo-\nrithm to detect the intersections of the polygons. The\nadvantage of GASV is that it can integrate both\narrayCGH and paired-end sequencing reads to call SVs,\nincluding CNVs. Different from GASV, GASVPro\nimplements a probabilistic model to integrate both read\npairs and read depth information [63]. Using a Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, GASVPro can\nmap all the reads to all possible locations. The breakend\nread depth (BeRD) information is defined as the\ndropped read depth at the breakpoints. Incorporating\nthe BeRD signals, GASVPro uses the amount of discor-\ndant read pairs to determine the probability of each\ndetected CNV. Another combinatorial tool, inGAP-SV,\ncan not only detect CNVs by combining read pairs and\nread depth information but also provide a genome\nbrowser-like visualization solution for large and complex\nSVs [64]. Similar to the beRD concept in GASVPro,\ninGAP-SV first uses the drops in read depth as signals\nZhao et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14(Suppl 11):S1\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/S11/S1\nPage 12 of 16\nto defined SV “ hotspots. ” Then, a heuristic search\napproach is applied on these hotspots to classify SVs\nusing the PEM approach. In summary, there are at least\ntwo key features for inGAP-SV: capacity to identify dif-\nferent types of CNVs and customized visualization.\nNovelSeq is the first tool to combine PEM and SR\napproaches and was developed specifically to detect\nnovel insertions in the genome [66]. It starts with the\nunmapped reads and assembles them to form contigs.\nA clustering algorithm is then applied to the assembled\ncontigs to identify potential insertion events supported\nby these unmapped reads. HYDRA is a tool that com-\nbines PEM and local de novo assembly to detect SVs\nand was originally applied in the mouse genome. It also\nrelies on discordant mate pairs for SV detection, using\nboth short and long reads as input [67]. HYDRA applies\na soft clustering approach to identify putative SVs and\nbreakpoints and therefore has the potential to be very\nuseful to identify SVs in repeat and duplication regions\nin the human genome.\nChallenges and perspectives\nIntensive efforts in recent years to develop computa-\ntional tools for CNV detection have resulted in 48 tools,\nas described in this paper, which target specific ranges\nof CNVs by utilizing differentcomputational strategies.\nSystematic comparison showed that only small overlap-\nping SVs/CNVs are identified based on different tools in\npopulation-scale genome sequencing [59]. These small\noverlaps imply there may be different scales of SVs/\nCNVs in the human genome. Recently, distinct SV pat-\nterns were observed in experiments that used two\nlibraries with different insert sizes [68]. This observation\nindicates the importance of choosing appropriate tools\nfor a specific experimental design.\nDespite improvements to NGS technologies and CNV-\ndetecting tools, the identification of low coverage CNVs\nstill remains a challenge. Although the RD-based approach\nhas to correct distortions caused by NGS biases, the rela-\ntionship between the read count and true copy number\ncan be distorted by several effects. The PCR process is\nknown to be one major cause of this distortion, where\ngenomic fragments with a lower PCR amplification rate\noften result in less reads [69,70]. Furthermore, sequencing\nprocess can also introduce system noise [55,71]. It was\nreported that NGS has lower sequencing coverage in regu-\nlatory regions [71]. In particular, the capability of exome\ncapture in the library preparation process complicates the\nconnection between true copy number and read count for\nWES data. All these factors contribute to the difficulty in\ndetecting the low coverage copy number. For the regions\nwith a low read count, it is hard to articulate if it is indeed\ndue to the low copy number or if it is a consequence of\nthe aforementioned processes. In the following section, we\nfocus on the RD-based strategy to discuss potential noise\nfrom NGS data and how to overcome these shortcomings\nusing specific normalization. Since most of the PEM- and\nSR-based tools described here are general tools to detect\nSVs, their limitations and strengths were extensively\nreviewed previously [16].\nOne well-investigated bias in RD-based methods is\nrelated to GC content, the percentage of guanine and\ncytosine bases in a genomic region. GC content varies\nmarkedly along the human genome and across species\nand has been found to influence read coverage on most\nsequencing platforms. In a recent study of the Illumina\nHiSeq and Genome Analyzer systems [72], for example, a\npositive correlation between read coverage and GC con-\ntent was observed when GC percentage is within the\nspectrum of 24 to 47%. To correct the GC bias, a widely\nused strategy in existing RD-based tools is to partition\nthe genome into windows/bins of either fixed or various\nsizes [28,31,41]. The number of reads mapped to each\nwindow are counted and then normalized based on the\nGC content of this windowed region. The adjusted read\ncount is then used as an indicator of the copy number of\nthe corresponding genomic region. In NGS applications\nthat involve a pair of disease and normal tissues taken\nf r o mt h es a m ep a t i e n ta n ds e q u e n c e do nt h es a m ep l a t -\nform, the effect of GC bias can be effectively cancelled\nout by comparing the paired genomes directly at each\nregion [31,33,41], thereby taking advantage of the similar-\nity of GC bias between the two paired samples. For\ninstance, CNAseg implemented an algorithm locally\nweighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) regression to\nadjust the GC bias for matched samples in each 10-Kb\nwindow. Moreover, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)\nis used to smooth the signals of mapped reads, which\nhelps to obtain more accurate estimation of relative copy\nnumbers between case and control samples.\nAnother major bias that affects CNV calling when using\nthe RD-based approach originates from read alignment. In\nthe alignment step, a signif icant portion of reads are\nmapped to multiple positions due to a short read length\nand the presence of repetitive regions in the reference gen-\nome. A variety of strategies have been proposed to assign\nambiguously mapped reads to the reference genome, and\neach suggested approach has its own pros and cons, affect-\ning read coverage and, hence, copy number in a different\nway. Some methods, e.g., BIC-seq [41] and SegSeq [33],\ncompletely ignore ambiguously mapped reads. Apparently,\nby counting only the uniquely mapped reads, these meth-\nods are not applicable to detect CNVs in homologous\ngenomic regions. Other methods, e.g., CNVnator [40],\nrandomly assign an ambiguous read to one of all possible\npositions to which this read is mapped by the aligner.\nThough capable of identifying copy numbers in repetitive\ngenomic regions, this strategy suffers from false positive\nZhao et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14(Suppl 11):S1\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/S11/S1\nPage 13 of 16\ndetection as a consequence of the random placement of\nambiguously mapped reads. One possible direction to\nimprove mapping sensitivity is to employ a soft clustering\napproach, which allows multiple good mappings [54].\nDespite these improvements on mapping algorithms, all of\nthe methods described here are still problematic in repeat\nregions. Allowing mismatches in repeat regions may\nincrease sensitivity in the future.\nTo assist researchers in selecting the proper NGS tool(s)\nfor their CNV studies, here, we summarize our discussion\nof SV-detecting tools collected in this paper. Several tools,\nsuch as JointSLM and ExoCNVTest, are applicable to\ndetect common CNVs shared among multiple samples,\nwhile CoNIFER and XHMM are good for rare CNV iden-\ntification from a population of WES samples. Additionally,\nPindel is an effective tool for the detection of small dele-\ntions of lengths less than 300 bp, while RD-based tools are\nmore suitable to characterize large CNV events. As for\nCNV breakpoints, SVseq is designed to identify deletion\nwith exact breakpoint infor mation from low coverage\nNGS data [73]. NovelSeq is specific to locate novel inser-\ntion. The tool inGAP-SV facilitates researchers to visualize\nthe detected interesting CNV regions.\nCompared with CNV detection using only single tool,\nthe combination of different software has proved effective\nin improving CNV prediction accuracy. For example, a\nstudy that combined the results of BreakDancer and\nVariationHunter demonstrated higher sensitivity and\nspecificity to detect SVs/CNVs [17]. This result implies\nthat the combination of different PEM tools can help\ndetect high confidence CNVs. In Table 4, we show that\nPEM-based tools are often combined with RD and AS\napproaches to improve both sensitivity and specificity for\nCNV detection using WGS data. Unlike WGS data, the\ndiscontinuous reads from WES limit the application of\nPEM-based methods. For example, the insert size for\npair-end reads in WES may not be long enough to detect\nCNV using PEM-based methods. However, the SR-based\ntool SLOPE has good performance to pinpoint transloca-\ntion events by focusing on small, targeted genomic\nregions. By recognizing the successful application of a\ncombinatorial approach to detect CNVs from WGS data,\nthe similar strategy to combine RD and SR features may\nprovide more reliable CNV predictions from WES data\n[74]. In summary, incorporating various signatures to sup-\nport the same CNV can dramatically improve both the\nstatistical power and resolution of CNV size and break-\npoints compared to each different strategy individually.\nCompeting for higher sequencing throughput, data\naccuracy and longer read lengths, today’s sequencing tech-\nnologies will continue to advance rapidly. One prominent\ndevelopment is the creating of third generation sequencing\n(TGS) technologies, which promise to provide dramati-\ncally longer read lengths. The first commercial TGS\nsequencer launched by PacBio (PacBio RS single molecule\nsequencing) can now produce reads of an average length\n1300 bp, significantly longer than that of any NGS plat-\nforms today. Longer reads will greatly ease read alignment\nand CNV detection in repetitive regions of genome\n[75,76]. These longer reads will significantly reduce map-\nping errors due to incorrect sequencing. The increased\nsize of the short read will also strengthen the statistical\npower of the RD methods. In addition, all these improve-\nments on mapping quality will benefit PEM methods to\navoid false positives caused by chimera in the genome. For\nthe SR methods, these longer reads may also ameliorate\ntheir inherent limitation of only detecting insertion events\nshorter than the average read length. Additionally, longer\nreads may improve assembly quality when implementing\nAS methods. The development of high resolution CNV\nd e t e c t i o nt o o l si sa ni t e r a t i v eprocess of integrating new\ntechnologies’ features and novel computational algorithms.\nThough these processes require committed efforts from\nindustry-academy collaborative work, the fruitful under-\nstanding of human CNVs in healthy and disease condi-\ntions will be a worthy endeavor, which may not only allow\ndiscrimination of driver mutations for pathogenesis of\nMendelian and complex diseases but also help to develop\npersonalized medicine in the future.\nAbbreviations\nAS: de novo assembly; BAM: Binary version of a SAM file; CB: Combinational\napproach; CBSm Circular binary segmentation; CGH: Comparative genome\nhybridization; CNV: Copy number variation; EM: Expectation maximization;\nFASTQ: Nucleotide sequence with its corresponding quality scores in text\nformat; FISH: Fluorescencein situ hybridization; HMM: Hidden Markov model;\nINDEL: Insertion and deletion; MSB: Mean shift-based method; NGS: Next-\ngeneration sequencing; PEM: Paired-end mapping; R: R language for\nstatistical analysis; RD: Read depth; SAM: Sequence Alignment/Map file\nformat; SLM: Shifting level model; SNP: Single-nucleotide polymorphism;\nSNV: Single-nucleotide variant; SR: Split read; SV: Structural variant; WES:\nWhole-exome sequencing; WGS: Whole-genome sequencing.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nMZ, PJ and ZZ conceived of the study.
