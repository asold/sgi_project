It \ninvolves posing a hypothesis, collecting dat a through observation and experimentation, and \nanalyzing and interpreting the results to reach a conclusion. Hence it helps to ensure that \nresearch is objective, replicable, and based on empirical evidence.  \nIn the field of epidemiology, the scientific method is essential for conducting rigorous and \ntransparent studies that can accurately address public health issues. As in many types of \nother research, in a typical epidemiologic st udy, the general flowchart of the scientific \nmethod process [2] includes identifying a research question, conducting a literature review, \ndesigning the study, collecting and analyzing data, and interpreting the results and \nimplications.  \nTherefore, given the importance and complexity  of this process, it appears essential to \ndefine shared rules, standards, and methodolog ies to guide the conduct of studies and \nmitigate the risk of misconduct or errors. In ot her words, it is crucial that epidemiological \nstudies are conducted transparently and rigorously, following acknowledged guidelines. The \nimportance of this has been underlined by many authors [3–5] and led to the development of \nthe most used guidelines globally: the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies \nin Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and guidelines. The STROBE guidelines provide a \nframework for the transparent reporting of observational studies, ensuring that the study's \nsections (introduction, methods, results, et c.) are accurately and thoroughly reported [2]. \nAdhering to the STROBE guidelines can increase the reliability and reproducibility of the \nstudy, as well as facilitate the critical appraisal and synthesis of the evidence [2]. \n \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field with numerous applications in a variety of \nfields [6]. Among these, one where AI has t he potential to make a significant impact is \nclinical research and epidemiology, where it c ould revolutionize the way these fields operate \nand significantly improve our understanding and management of public health and \nhealthcare management issues. Both fields rely on the collection and analysis of large \namounts of data, making them well-suited for the application of AI technologies [7,8]. One \naspect in which AI has yet to show its poten tial is the overall support for conducting \nepidemiological studies. In particular, given the complexity of epidemiological studies, and \nthe increasingly present need to speed up and st reamline their execution - while preserving \nscientific quality and integrity - it appears necessa ry to study applications of AI in supporting \nthe overall conduct of epidemiological studies, i.e. the support for study design, data analysis \nand interpretation of results. Both the tools and the studies that test and validate them are \nscarce in this field, and some potentially revolutionary tools, namely AI-based transformers, \nhave only recently been introduced [9–11]. \n \n1.1.ChatGPT and AI-based transformers  \nIn recent years, techniques based on deep l earning are boosting the AI revolution. Among \nthem, Transformers [12,13] show prominent results in a number of applications. A \nTransformer is a type of neural network arch itecture that was introduced in the paper \n\"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani and colleagues in 2017 [14]. The transformer \narchitecture is a type of deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention and \nis particularly adept at processing sequential data such as machine translation, language \nmodeling, and text classification. The transform er model incorporates attention mechanisms \nAll rights reserved.

It is a machine \nlearning algorithm capable of generating high- quality scientific text [16], that was developed \nby a team of researchers at OpenAI, and has re ceived significant attention in the scientific \ncommunity due to its impressive performance and potential applications. AI-based \ntransformers, such as ChatGPT, may represent a significant advance in the field of AI and \ncould have the potential to impact the wa y scientific research is conducted and \ncommunicated. However, there are also se veral potential drawbacks to their use for \nscientific research and scientific publishing, particularly in public health and epidemiology, \nand their use to support researchers in conducti ng epidemiological studies has not yet been \nstudied.  \n \n1.2.Aim of the study \nThe aim of this study is to shed light and describe how early-stage AI-based transformers \nmodels can help a researcher in the various steps of an epidemiological study. To do this, \nwe used the OpenAI ChatGPT to partially simulate an epidemiological study, reformulating \nthe STROBE framework into a list of questions to be answered by the transformer itself. We \nthen qualitatively evaluated the coherence and re levance of the transformer’s outputs and \ndiscussed the pros and cons of this innovation in the field of epidemiology. \n \n2.Methods \nIn this exploratory study, we assessed how ChatGPT could support an epidemiological \nstudy. To do this, we first chose a study to  be used as a basis for the simulation, and \nextracted the research question and the spec ific aim. We then relied on the STROBE \nchecklist as a basis for formulating the questions to be asked to ChatGPT. Specifically, we \nasked ChatGPT to transform each STROBE checklist’s item into a question/prompt for itself. \nWe then asked the transformer to answer the questions, in order to provide support to the \nresearcher in conducting the epi demiological study. Each specific answer was evaluated by \nthree independent senior researchers in terms of coherence and relevance for the purposes \nof conducting the epidemiological study. \nWhen formulating the various prompts, we used the selected study as a guideline [17]. This \nstudy by Subramanian and Kumar analyzed the relationship between the percentage of the \npopulation fully vaccinated and new cases of COVID-19 in 68 countries. Subramanian study \nused COVID-19 publicly available data for cr oss-country analysis. We chose this type of \nstudy because its relatively simple design straightforward interpretation.  \nStarting from this article, we extracted the aim of the study, considering this as a purely \nhuman activity related to human curiosity to  ask questions and to transform them into \nresearch questions. The aim of the study served as the basis for contextualizing the use of \nAI-based transformers and demonstrating its potential usefulness in supporting the conduct \nof an epidemiological study. \n \n2.1.Using STROBE recommendations prospectively  \nThe STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) \nguidelines are a set of recommendations fo r reporting observational studies, including \ncohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studie s. These guidelines provide a framework for \ntransparent and complete reporting of the desi gn, conduct, and results of an observational \nAll rights reserved.

By following the STROBE guidelines during the design and conduct of the study, \nresearchers can ensure that the study is conducted in a transparent and rigorous manner \nand that the results of the study are accurately and clearly reported. \nThe STROBE guidelines provide specific re commendations for the reporting of various \naspects of the study, such as the study desi gn, the sampling and recruitment of participants, \nthe measurement of exposures and outcomes, and the analysis and interpretation of the \nresults. \n \n2.3. ChatGPT \nGPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is  a third-generation, autoregressive language \nmodel that uses deep learning to produce human-like text developed by OpenAI. It is \ndesigned to generate human-like text and engage in conversation with users naturally and \nintuitively. To train the GPT model, researcher s at OpenAI fed it a large dataset of human-\ngenerated text and utilized the model to predict the next word in the sequence. The model \nwas then fine-tuned using backpropagation, a technique that involves adjusting the model's \nweights and biases to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. \nAfter the model was trained, it was able to generate human-like text by predicting the next \nword in a sequence based on the context provided by the previous words. The model can be \nfine-tuned for specific tasks, such as translation or question answering, by training it on a \ndataset specific to that task. \nIt is worth noting that ChatGPT, a variant of GPT specifically designed for generating \nhuman-like text in a conversational context, such as chatbots or virtual assistants, is not the \nsame as GPT. While ChatGPT is trained on a dataset of human conversation and is able to \ngenerate text that is appropriate for use in a chat or messaging context, the underlying \ntechnology and principles of how ChatGPT works are the same as those of GPT. \nOne of the key features of ChatGPT is its abilit y to generate text that is coherent and follows \nthe structure and style of scientific articles. It has been trained on large datasets by using \n175 billion parameters on Microsoft’s Azure’s AI supercomputer and has learned to generate \ntext that is similar to human-written scientific text in terms of grammar, style, and content. \nThis makes it a valuable tool for resear chers who need to generate large amounts of \nscientific text, such as descriptions of ex perimental methods and results, summaries of \nresearch findings, or review articles [18]. \n \n2.4.The use of ChatGPT for supporting the conduction of the study \nFirst, we identified the purpose of the study as: [To examine the relationship between the \npercentage of population fully vaccinated and the incidence of new COVID-19 cases in a \ngiven population, and to assess the impact of vaccination on the incidence of COVID-19 \ncases.] \nTo maximize the use of ChatGPT, we adopted the STROBE framework, translating its main \nitems/recommendations into prospective questions for the AI transformer. To standardize the \nuse of the transformer as much as possible, we followed the process listed below: \n \nSTROBE item > question/prompt for ChatGPT > adaptation to the simulated research \nquestions > final answer \n \nAll rights reserved.

Then, the next step has been the specific question: \n \n“[Answer#1]+[The study has the following aim: To examine the relationship between the \npercentage of population fully vaccinated and the incidence of new COVID-19 cases in a \ngiven population, and to assess the impact of vaccination on the incidence of COVID-19 \ncases] \n \n2.5. Expert assessment \nWe assessed the outputs of the transformer by using human annotators to rate the quality \nand relevance of the model's responses. This has been done through a process called \n\"human evaluation,\" in which annotators (NN, FT, AB) were asked to rate the responses \nproduced by the model on a 1 to 5 points Likert scale. The annotators were asked to \nconsider factors such as the coherence of the response and its relevance to the prompt. \nGiven that there are no standardized questions t hat are specifically designed to evaluate the \nquality and relevance of the responses produc ed by ChatGPT or any other language model \nin terms of coherence and relevance, we evaluated the outputs by asking the expert \nannotators to consider the following questions: \n \n1. Is the response coherent and well-formed, or is it difficult to understand? (where 5 is \nthe maximum level of coherence) \n2. Is the response relevant and informative, or is it lacking in substance? (where 5 is the \nmaximum level of relevance) \n \nFor each STROBE recommendation, we formulated a prompt for ChatGPT contextualizing it \nwith the aim of the study by Subramanian and Kumar (2021) [17]. Each response to the \nprompts was then evaluated by domain experts to assess its consistency and relevance. \n \n3. Results \nThe STROBE checklist includes a list of 35 recommendations (Table S1). From these \nrecommendations we derived 35 specific questions for ChatGPT. Three domain experts \nevaluated the answers independently using two coherence and relevance scores (Table 1). \nThe mean scores were heterogeneous. On average,  for the coherence scores, the overall \nmean score was 3.6 out of 5.0, and for relevance it was 3.3 out of 5.0. \n \nMore in details, item #9 (“What should be included in the definition of outcomes, exposures, \npredictors, potential confounders, and effect m odifiers in an observational study, and how \nshould diagnostic criteria be provided, if appl icable, according to the STROBE guidelines? ”), \nin the Methods section, received a very satisfactory response in terms of both coherence \n(5.0/5.0) and relevance (5.0/5.0); therefore, t he responses given were rated very positively \n(“According to the STROBE guidelines, in order to clearly define all outcomes, exposures, \npredictors, potential confounders,  and effect modifiers in your observational study, you \nAll rights reserved.

Outcomes: In this study, \nthe outcome would be the incidence of new COVID-19 cases in a given population. You \nshould specify how you will measure the incidence of COVID-19 cases (e.g. number of new \ncases per 100,000 population), and provide any relevant diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 \n(e.g. symptoms, test results). Exposures: The exposure in this study would be the \npercentage of the population that is fully va ccinated. You should specify how you will \nmeasure the percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated (e.g. number of individuals \nwho have received both doses of the vaccine), and provide any relevant information on the \nspecific vaccine(s) used. Predictors: The pred ictor in this study would be the percentage of \nthe population that is fully vaccinated. [...]”. \n \nSimilarly, the answer to item #10, Methods section, was also rated very positively (“ What \nshould be included in the description of sour ces of data and methods of assessment for \neach variable of interest in an observational study, and how should comparability of \nassessment methods be described if there is more than one group, according to the \nSTROBE guidelines?”), and received a satisfactory response in terms of both coherence \n(4.7/5.0) and relevance (4.7/5.0). Here, too, in  the opinion of the evaluators, the transformer \nresponse was complete and adequate (“ According to the STROBE guidelines, in order to \nprovide a clear and transparent  description of the sources of data and methods of \nassessment for each variable of interest in your observational study, you should include the \nfollowing information: For each variable of interest (e.g. percentage of population fully \nvaccinated, incidence of new COVID-19 cases), specify the source of data (e.g. \nadministrative records, survey data). For each variable of interest, describe the method of \nassessment in detail. For example, if you are using administrative records to measure the \npercentage of population fully vaccinated, you should describe how the records were \ncollected and how you will extract the relevant information. If you are using survey data to \nmeasure the incidence of new COVID-19 cases, you should describe the survey instrument \nand how you will collect and analyze the data. If there is more than one group in your study \n(e.g. different populations or time periods),  describe the comparability of assessment \nmethods for each variable of interest. For ex ample, if you are comparing the percentage of \npopulation fully vaccinated in two different populations, you should describe whether the \nvaccination programs were similar in the tw o populations and whether the data sources and \nmethods of assessment were comparable. [...]”. \nIn contrast, some responses received particu larly negative ratings from domain experts. For \nexample, the response to item/recommendat ion #14, Methods section, received negative \ncomments in terms of both coherence and relevance (2.3/5.0, and 1.7/5.0, respectively). The \nquestion was: “What statistical methods should be described, including those used to control \nfor confounding, according to the STROBE guidelines? ”. And the answer (“According to the \nSTROBE guidelines, you should describe all statis tical methods that you used in your study \nto examine the relationship between vaccination and COVID-19 incidence, including any \nmethods used to control for confounding factors. This may include methods such as \nmultivariate regression analysis or stratified analysis, depending on the specific design and \nanalysis of your study. It is important to provide a clear and detailed description of your \nstatistical methods in order to allow rea ders to understand and evaluate the validity and \nreliability of your findings. ”) was not deemed adequate either in terms of coherence or \nrelevance. \nSimilarly, for item #18 (\"What should be included in the report of an observational study in \norder to describe sensitivity analyses according to the STROBE guidelines?\"), the answer \nAll rights reserved.

We then assessed the coherence and relevance of the transformer’s \noutputs. We used an observational study that analyzes publicly available data to investigate \nthe relationship between the percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 \ncases. It is important to note that we start ed from the premise that while AI can potentially \nassist in reproducing a study, the research question, the aim of the study, and all the aspects \nof originality should remain the sole domain of humans. Therefore, we began our simulation \nby using a research question and aim of the study devised by a human. \nAfter ChatGPT has answered to all the STROBE recommendations, we asked independent \nexperts to qualitatively evaluate the coherence and relevance of the tranformer’s outputs. In \nthe last few months, these innovative systems have proven to be fast and intuitive and an \nimportant support for researchers. Howeve r, the coherence, relevance, and even the \ncorrectness of their answers is not always cl ear, and there are currently no studies, to our \nknowledge, that critically analyze the use of these tools in epidemiological research [21]. The \nchoice of the STROBE checklist and the method of turning its recommendations into \nquestions for ChatGPT represents an attempt to standardize and make our analysis as more \nreproducible as possible. In fact, by follo wing the STROBE guidelines, researchers can help \nensure that their results are accurately and clearly reported, which can help other \nresearchers and policymakers understand and interpret the results of the study. This is \nparticularly important in the field of epidemio logy, as the results of epidemiological studies \ncan have important implications for public health policy and practice. \n \nFrom the results of our analysis, we found that ChatGPT can be a valuable support for \nresearchers, both experienced and inexperienced,  in setting up an epidemiological study, \nparticularly observational, following internationally recognized guidelines and standards. The \naverage score attributed by experts to the responses given by the AI -based transformer was \nabove 3.5 over 5, but with a fair amount of va riability among responses to individual outputs. \nThis is consistent with suggestions and preliminary analyses in the limited literature available \non these tools [9–11,22], which indicate that AI-based transformers are beginning to be used \nbut with some skepticism, partly due to their suboptimal ability to respond adequately, in \nterms of consistency and relevance, to questions posed by domain expert researchers. \nTherefore, it seems essential that users of these tools have knowledge about the subject \nmatter and a critical mindset when evaluating their outputs. Blindly accepting the answers of \nthese tools may still be too great a risk to the integrity of science and thus human society. \nIt is also interesting to note that the researchers rated some ChatGPT outputs very positively \nand others very negatively. Notably, both the responses rated very positively and those rated \nvery negatively were in the methods part. Th is suggests that, when properly queried, the \ntransformer may provide more appropriate ans wers in the methodological and data analysis \nand reporting domains, which were found to have the highest level of consistency and \nrelevance. \nEven in the introduction part, this AI-based transfo rmer can be useful in placing a study in \ncontext. As literature has shown [21], these sy stems can function as true \"scientific writers\" \nand can quickly and adequately contribute to the wr iting of entire paragraphs.

A \npossible explanation for this drop in performance may be related to the training data of \nChatGPT. Specifically, the AI-based transform er was not specifically trained on scientific \narticles. This issue may be partially addressed by specific training or fine-tuning [16,23]. \n \nOur analysis showed the ability of AI-bas ed transformers to generate answers and human-\nlike text, which could potentially be used to conduct epidemiological studies or write research \narticles. This could potentially save time and re sources for researchers,  as these activities \ncan be time-consuming and labor-intensive.  \nHowever, there are also several potential draw backs to the use of AI-based transformers for \nscientific research [21,24]. One concern is the ri sk of bias in the data that is used to train \nthese systems. If the data used to train the AI  system is biased, the system may produce \nbiased results or make biased recommendati ons. This could have serious consequences, \nparticularly in the field of public health and epidemiology where decisions about interventions \nand policies may be based on the results of research. \nAnother concern that is often reported in the cr itical analysis of these systems [19,25], is the \npotential for AI-based transformers to replace human researchers, potentially leading to job \nloss and the devaluation of human expertise [10]. However, our assessment suggests a \npossible shift in the \"study-experiment-analysis-results-writing-publication\" paradigm. It \nseems more likely that, with the support of these systems, we will move towards a model \nwhere the researcher can focus more on the study and experimental phase then on \nmethodological problems and questions. \n \nAnother risk associated with the use of AI in scientific research is the potential for fraudulent \nmanipulation of large-scale scientific publications. An example of this is related to the \nscientific publisher IOP, which retracted as many  as 850 articles in 2022 after a researcher \nat the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom discovered that many of them \ncontained nonsensical phrases produced by arti ficial intelligence programs trying to avoid \nanti-plagiarism software. These phrases were  repeated a staggering number of times in \ndifferent articles from different groups. When IOP began investigating, the editor found other \nsimilarities that suggested the articles came from a so-called \"Scientific Paper Mill\" a \ncompany that produces and sells pseudo-articles for a fee. \nThe use of AI-based solutions capable of generati ng text in scientific research also brings \nwith it many legal implications. However, it is beyond the scope of this article to address in \ndetail each and all the possible legal issues t hat may arise when using AI tools to generate \ntext to be published in scientific studies. For our purposes, we can highlight that one of the \nmain concerns is the issue of plagiarism and copyright infringement. AI-generated text may \nbe similar or identical to existing copyrighted ma terial, which could lead to legal issues for \nresearchers and their institutions. It is impor tant for researchers to be aware of these \npotential issues and take steps to ensure that their work does not violate any copyright laws. \nUsing anti-plagiarism software to evaluate the generated text can be a helpful tool in \nreducing the risk of publishing non-original text. \nWe look forward to the development and refinement of these systems, which will be helpful \nin preserving scientific int egrity and ethics and will be of gr eat assistance to publishers and \nother stakeholders.

They can identify potential instances of plagiarism or \ncopyright infringement, allowing researchers to make necessary changes before publishing \ntheir work. It is important to note, however, that anti-plagiarism software may not catch all \ninstances of plagiarism. Therefore, it is im portant for researchers to also use their own \njudgment and to carefully review the AI-generated text for any potential instances of \nplagiarism or copyright infringement. \nAnother legal implication in using AI-based solutions for text generation in scientific research \nis the accuracy of the information. As mentioned earlier, AI-generated text may contain \nerrors or inaccuracies that can have serious  consequences for the scientific community. For \nexample, if an AI-generated article is publis hed in a reputable journal and it contains \ninaccurate information, it could lead to other researchers basing their work on flawed data. \nTherefore, it is crucial for researchers to t horoughly check that the final product is sound and \nreliable. \nIn short, it is important to stress that even if AI tools are used to generate text, the \nresponsibility for the research still lies with the humans to whom the work is attributed. This \nmeans that researchers and their institutions ar e responsible for ensuring that their work is \nlegally compliant and that it does not infri nge on any copyright laws or contain any \ninaccuracies. This highlights the need for careful consideration and adherence to ethical and \nlegal guidelines when utilizing AI in scientific research. \n \n4.1.Limits of the study \nIt is important to note that, being an ML algorithm, ChatGPT's answers may differ if re-run \nafter some time. This represents a limitation in the reproducibility of the results of our study. \nFurthermore, there is no single way to form ulate questions to the transformer; different \nquestions, even on the same topic, produce di fferent answers, which may be more or less \nconsistent and relevant to the objective of the analysis, representing a limitation of the study. \nHowever, in the context of the present study, we tried to standardize this process as much \nas possible by starting with STROBE recommendations and directly asking the AI-based \ntransformer to adapt them into prompts for itse lf. This may have at least partially mitigated \nthe risk of variability. \n \n5.Conclusions \nIn this exploratory study, we evaluated the coherence and relevance of an open AI-based \ntransformer’s answers regarding questions extracted and reformulated from the STROBE \nrecommendations for observational studies.  \nFrom our assessment, the transformer can be considered as a valuable support for \nresearchers, both experienced and inexperienced,  in setting up an epidemiological study, \nfollowing internationally recognized guidelin es and standards. The average score attributed \nby experts to the responses given by the AI -based transformer was high, but with a fair \namount of variability among responses to individual outputs. \nResponses related to the methods, data analysis and reporting domains and \nrecommendations were found to have the highest level of coherence and relevance, \nemphasizing that these innovative tools may be primarily useful for methodological and \nstatistical support, rather than for building the conceptual frameworks of the study and the \nnarrative structure of the paper. \nTherefore, it seems essential that users of these tools have knowledge about the subject \nmatter and a critical mindset when evaluating their outputs. Blindly accepting the answers of \nthese tools may pose a serious threat to the ethics and integrity of scientific research, \nAll rights reserved.

To accurately \nanswer this question, more information about the methods used in the study would be needed. In general, subgroups \ncan be defined by characteristics such as age, gender, or preexisting health conditions, and examining the relationship \nbetween the percentage of population fully vaccinated and the incidence of COVID-19 cases in these subgroups can \nprovide insight into how vaccination may differentially impact different groups. Interactions refer to the combined effect \nof two or more factors on an outcome, and examining interactions can help determine whether the relationship \nbetween vaccination and COVID-19 incidence is modified by other factors. Methods that may be used to examine \nsubgroups and interactions in a study include stratified analyses, multivariate regression, and subgroup analyses. \n2.3 3.0 \n16 How should missing data be addressed \nin the report of an observational study \naccording to the STROBE guidelines? \nThe study has the following aim: to \nexamine the relationship between the \npercentage of population fully vaccinated \nand the incidence of new COVID-19 \ncases in a given population, and to \nassess the impact of vaccination on the \nincidence of COVID-19 cases. \nAccording to the STROBE guidelines, the report of an observational study should include information about how \nmissing data were addressed in order to ensure the validity and reliability of the results. This might include: \n \nDescription of missing data: Describe the extent of missing data in the study, including the number and percentage of \nparticipants with missing data for each variable of interest. \n \nHandling of missing data: Explain how missing data were handled in the analysis, including any methods used to \nimpute or estimate missing values (e.g., multiple imputation, last observation carried forward). \n \nSensitivity analyses: Conduct and report sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results to different \nassumptions about missing data. This might include comparing the results of the main analysis to those obtained using \ndifferent imputation methods or excluding participants with missing data. \n \nIt is also important to clearly state the aim of the study, as you have done, in order to provide context for the analysis \nand interpretation of the results. \n3.3 3.3 \n17 How was loss to follow-up addressed in \na cohort study, and how was matching of \ncases and controls addressed in a case-\ncontrol study?

You should also report any relevant summary \nmeasures of the outcome, such as the mean or median number of cases in each group. \n3.7 4.0 \n28 According to the STROBE guidelines, \nhow should unadjusted estimates and, if \napplicable, confounder-adjusted \nestimates and their precision (such as \n95% confidence intervals) be reported, \nand how should it be made clear which \nconfounders were adjusted for and why \nthey were included? \nThe study has the following aim: to \nexamine the relationship between the \npercentage of population fully vaccinated \nand the incidence of new COVID-19 \ncases in a given population, and to \nassess the impact of vaccination on the \nincidence of COVID-19 cases. \nAccording to the STROBE guidelines, you should report unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted \nestimates and their precision (such as 95% confidence intervals) to allow readers to understand the relationship \nbetween the exposure and the outcome, and to assess the potential impact of confounders on this relationship. \n \nIn your study, you should report unadjusted estimates of the relationship between the percentage of population fully \nvaccinated and the incidence of COVID-19 cases, as well as any confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision. \nYou should also make it clear which confounders were adjusted for in the analysis and why they were included. This \nwill allow readers to understand the impact of the confounders on the relationship between the exposure and the \noutcome, and to assess the robustness of your findings. \n \nFor example, you might report the unadjusted odds ratio for the relationship between vaccination and COVID-19 \nincidence, as well as the confounder-adjusted odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. You should also specify \nwhich confounders were adjusted for in the analysis (such as age, sex, and pre existing medical conditions) and why \nthese confounders were included (such as because they are known to be associated with both the exposure and the \noutcome). \n4.3 3.7 \n29 What are the guidelines for reporting \ncategory boundaries when continuous \nvariables are categorized in \nobservational studies in epidemiology? \nThe study has the following aim: to \nexamine the relationship between the \npercentage of population fully vaccinated \nand the incidence of new COVID-19 \ncases in a given population, and to \nassess the impact of vaccination on the \nincidence of COVID-19 cases. \nAccording to the STROBE guidelines, when continuous variables are categorized in observational studies, the \ncategory boundaries should be reported. In your study examining the relationship between vaccination and COVID-19 \nincidence, you should report the category boundaries for the percentage of population fully vaccinated. This will allow \nreaders to understand how the continuous variable of vaccination was divided into categories for analysis. \n3.3 3.3 \n30 What is the STROBE recommendation \nfor translating estimates of relative risk \ninto absolute risk for a meaningful time \nperiod, if relevant? \nAccording to the STROBE guidelines, if relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a \nmeaningful time period. In your study examining the relationship between vaccination and COVID-19 incidence, this \nmay be relevant if you want to express the risk of developing COVID-19 in terms of the number of cases that occur \nover a specific time period (e.g. cases per 100,000 population per year).

This will \nallow readers to understand the full range of analyses that were conducted and the potential impact of any factors that \nwere considered. In your study examining the relationship between vaccination and COVID-19 incidence, it may be \nuseful to report any subgroup or interaction analyses that were done to better understand how the relationship \nbetween vaccination and COVID-19 incidence varies across different subpopulations or under different conditions. \nSensitivity analyses can also be helpful in assessing the robustness of the study findings. \n3.3 2.0 \nDiscussion \n32 According to the STROBE guidelines, \nhow should key results be summarized \nwith reference to the study objectives? \nThe study has the following aim: to \nexamine the relationship between the \npercentage of population fully vaccinated \nand the incidence of new COVID-19 \ncases in a given population, and to \nassess the impact of vaccination on the \nincidence of COVID-19 cases. \nAccording to the STROBE guidelines, you should summarize the key results of your study with reference to the study \nobjectives to allow readers to understand the main findings of the study and how they relate to the research question. \n \nIn your study, you should summarize the key results of the relationship between the percentage of population fully \nvaccinated and the incidence of COVID-19 cases, with reference to the study objective of assessing the impact of \nvaccination on the incidence of COVID-19 cases.
