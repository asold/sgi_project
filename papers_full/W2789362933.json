Researchers and practitioners have moved towards using animal-based measures\nfor this purpose, as it was recognised that measuring human practices and resource manage-\nment alone was insufficient, because animal-based health and behaviour measures best repre-\nsent the status of the animal [5]. Groups of animals used for human purposes benefit from\nhaving their welfare assessed, in order to measure and manage their quality of life. Most tools\nfor welfare assessment were originally created for animals in farms or laboratories, and specific\ntools for other species followed. This included animals used for work, which are still highly\nprevalent in many places. Nearly 100 of the 112 million equids (horses, donkeys and mules)\nworldwide are in Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) [6, 7]. The majority of these are\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01923 54 February 21, 2018 1 / 21\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Sommer ville R, Brown AF, Upjohn M\n(2018) A standardised equine-based welfare\nassessmen t tool used for six years in low and\nmiddle income countries.

Owners and users of working equids (‘owners’) earn\ndirect income generated by them via working in the agricultural, construction and tourism\nindustries, as well as benefiting from support to households daily through transporting fire-\nwood, water, people or agricultural produce [9–11].\nA variety of animal-based welfare assessment protocols have been developed and trialled in\nequids. The Animal Welfare Indicators project developed assessment protocols for horses [12,\n13] and donkeys [14] as a follow up to the Welfare Quality1 [1] project on farm animals.\nThese could be used in equestrian sport disciplines and on farms [15, 16, 17]. Qualitative\nBehaviour Assessment has been applied to donkeys [18], although it has been suggested that\nthis alone is not sufficient for a comprehensive welfare assessment because welfare is multi-fac-\neted [19]. To document facial expressions across different contexts, Equine Facial Action Cod-\ning System was developed to record individual facial movements in different applications\nranging from veterinary research to art and film animation [20]. The Horse Grimace Scale was\nalso developed to identify equine pain responses, such as post-surgical pain [21] but does not\napply to horses under other conditions and there is recognition that the face is not always the\nbest place to look because pain involves other body areas too [22, 23].\nOther aspects of equine welfare compromise have been explored through animal-based\nmeasures. Abnormal repetitive behaviour of equids has been described in detail, predomi-\nnantly in horses, in relation to factors including the type of breed, feed, housing [24] and work\n[25]. Depression-like behaviour has been suggested to be visible in horses measured by a fixed\ngaze and head, ear and neck position, a flat posture and withdrawal from the surrounding\nenvironment [26]. Individual characteristics and extrinsic factors, such as housing conditions\nand environmental management, have been reported to influence equine welfare and learning\nabilities [27]. It has been shown that horse owners are not effective in identifying back pain\n[28] or abnormal repetitive behaviours via questionnaire when they are highly prevalent [29],\nhighlighting the importance of using trained assessors and observation. A range of such mea-\nsures have been brought together as tools to assess equine welfare, see Hockenhull and Whay\n[30] for a review.\nAll of these methodologies for welfare assessment were developed and applied predomi-\nnantly in Upper-Middle Income Countries and High-Income Countries (HICs), because the\nmajority of animal welfare funding and research is based there. In LMICs, where the majority\nof the world’s equids exist, the requirements for welfare assessment tools differ. A tool that\nfocuses on issues typical to HICs (e.g. obesity, stereotypy) would not be suitable. Issues seen in\nthe LMIC context rather than in HICs include lesions from hobbling (head collar restraint is\nnot always the local norm), firing the skin (for identification or intended treatment) and muti-\nlation to parts of the body (for cultural or identification reasons). Welfare issues that are gener-\nally more highly prevalent in LMICs than in HICs include gait abnormalities, low body\ncondition, lesions from harnessing, fear of humans and poor hoof condition [23, 31]. Tools\nneed to be practical to conduct with limited resources in difficult to reach locations. For exam-\nple, welfare assessments may take place in remote communities that are only accessible by dirt\nroad or track, at high altitude and there may not be electricity, running water, or internet\naccess available. There may also be prevailing conditions of drought, extreme weather or politi-\ncal instability. A tool that takes a long time to perform or that requires more than very basic\nequipment would not be suitable.\nSome welfare issues experienced by working equids in LMICs may affect a very high pro-\nportion of the population (e.g. 90–100% for lameness), substantially greater than in HICs [32].\nAs there is a risk that welfare problems can be perceived to be normal or acceptable, when they\nare highly prevalent in a population [28, 29, 33, 34], the welfare assessment approach needs to\nA welfare assessmen t tool used on working equids in low and middle income countries\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01923 54 February 21, 2018 2 / 21\nmitigate this. Methodologies for working equine welfare assessment need to detect the full\nrange of relevant conditions. Whilst many of these are included in welfare assessment tools\nfrom HICs, issues may be less severe than in LMICs. Tools for equids in any setting need to\ncapture the overall welfare status (from good to poor) and the severity and prevalence of indi-\nvidual issues. For example, a donkey welfare assessment protocol used in Botswana with 100\nindividuals [35] included an indicator for ‘Lesions and scars (number, location, severity)’.\nThe Standardised Equine Based Welfare Assessment Tool (SEBWAT) described here\nevolved from the Working Equine Welfare Assessment (WEWA) that was developed through\na collaboration between Brooke, an international equine welfare Non-Governmental Organi-\nsation (NGO) and Bristol University [31]. To our knowledge, at the time it was the first ani-\nmal-based welfare assessment tool to be used for working equids and to be applied in practice\nby an NGO. A condensed version of WEWA was applied to identify environmental risk factors\nacross nine LMIC countries [36] and applied in Romania with different categorisation [37]. In\nLMICs, social research methods such as Participatory Rural Appraisal have also been applied\nto investigate equine welfare, by gathering from owners their perceptions of their animals’ wel-\nfare needs [38, 39]. Similar methods have been used to investigate risk factors for working\nequine welfare issues [32], which may be used instead of or alongside objective welfare assess-\nment. Whilst participatory tools benefit from increasing engagement of owners with the out-\ncome and resulting interventions at the community level, the accuracy of the welfare status\ncaptured could be lower. Trained assessors are required to record welfare information that is\nused to inform NGO, government, or industry policies and performance on working equine\nwelfare.\nEvidence generated from welfare assessment data is important for identifying welfare prob-\nlems and evaluating potential solutions, tracking progress over time, supporting funding deci-\nsions, and conducting needs assessment, monitoring, evaluation and research. Governments,\nNGOs and other stakeholders interested in making progress on animal welfare require robust\nevidence in order to inform interventions. Welfare assessment data could be used to identify\npriority issues that need to be addressed through national policy initiatives or NGO\nprogrammes.\nIt is desirable that field-based tools in these contexts are: simple to learn to accommodate\nwelfare assessors (‘assessors’) with potentially little formal education to be trained in the tool;\nvery low cost, minimising equipment and technology because of the factors described which\nmake assessment difficult such as limited technological infrastructure; rapid to conduct per\nanimal to minimise the time owners are kept from work; using local resources of persons and\nequipment; acceptable to varying cultures for owners to agree to their animal being assessed;\nand transferable to different geographical and socio-economic settings to avoid needing adapt-\ning to each context.\nBrooke is working to improve the welfare of working equids in LMICs in Africa, Asia and\nLatin America. Brooke operates by engaging communities to build their knowledge and\nchange practices on equine welfare, providing emergency treatment and training to support\nthe local animal healthcare provision infrastructure, and advocating for recognition and pro-\ntection of equine animals through incorporation into national and international policies. This\npaper aims to present the SEBWAT for working equids and discuss the findings from its\nimplementation by Brooke since 2010. We describe the development of the tool dating from a\npreceding version developed in 2003 (WEWA), the methodology, its application on a large\nscale in a real-life context on working equids, case examples of its use in Guatemala and Jor-\ndan, and conclude by discussing its strengths and weaknesses, the benefits for wider use, its\nlimitations and potential future development.\nA welfare assessmen t tool used on working equids in low and middle income countries\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01923 54 February 21, 2018 3 / 21\nDevelopment of the tool\nAnimal-based welfare data have been collected by Brooke from 2003 to date, the primary purpose\nof this collection is to identify prevalent welfare issues and to inform monitoring and evaluation\nof programmes. Monitoring typically involves annual data collection, the purpose of which is to\ntrack changes over time in a given region. The purpose of evaluation is to use historically collected\ndata to inform the impact assessment of a project over a period of time, alongside assessment of\nthe effectiveness of the structure and management of the intervention. Indirect benefits of using\nthe tool include building the capacity of staff in equine behaviour and handling and generating a\nlarge database that can be explored to inform emerging needs, such as responding to disasters.\nSince the initial conception and implementation of the WEWA tool, the tool needed to\nevolve to fulfil Brooke’s diversifying requirements for animal-based data, such as more sensi-\ntive measures to detect small changes over time, or differences between groups of animals for\nmonitoring. Therefore WEWA was reviewed and replaced in 2010 with the tool presented\nhere, SEBWAT, which has been implemented from December 2010 (the first assessment was\nin Jordan) up to the time of writing.\nThe review of WEWA was conducted considering its use in the preceding six years. Asses-\nsors from Brooke UK and international teams, external animal welfare scientists and veterinar-\nians contributed to the review. This resulted in four key amendments: i) removing parameters\nwith limited use (e.g. skin elasticity, side walk, cow hocks); ii) adding missing parameters (e.g.\near mutilations, ‘interference’ lesions from one hoof striking the adjacent limb or the hind\nhooves striking the heels of the fore limbs and genital lesions); iii) replacing or dividing binary\nscores into multi-level scores and iv) adjusting the sensitivity of measures of abnormality,\nwhich made the new tool more informative to Brooke.\nFor example, we compared WEWA and SEBWAT measures from data collected on 350\nworking equids in Petra, Jordan in November 2010. For eyes the abnormality indicator\nchanged from binary (normal/abnormal) in WEWA to a three level (mild, moderate, severe)\nabnormality scale in SEBWAT [40]. With WEWA the result showed 100% prevalence of eye\nabnormality, whilst SEBWAT showed equids had no/mild abnormality (73%), moderate\nabnormality (13%) and severe abnormality (14%); therefore enhancing the sensitivity of the\ntool. Species comparisons revealed that with WEWA horses and donkeys/mules both scored\n100% abnormality, whereas with SEBWAT horses had moderate abnormality (18%) and severe\neye abnormality (9%), and donkeys/mules had moderate (11%) and severe abnormality (24%),\ntherefore species-specific differences were revealed through the increased sensitivity. A further\nexample of the effect of changing the rubric is for body lesions, whereby in WEWA lesions\nwith fully broken skin but less than a minimum size of 4 sq cm would not be recorded, but\nwould with the SEBWAT measure. Therefore Head/ears lesions (74%), Girth/belly lesions\n(55%), and Withers/spine lesions (81%) captured in SEBWAT were missed by WEWA. The\nadjusted measure sensitivity addressed underestimation of lesion prevalence in the population.\nThis demonstrates the benefit of welfare assessment protocols being periodically reviewed\nfor the context they are used in to ensure that they are fit for purpose. Whilst here the tool\nchanges applied to working equids, the review process could be applicable to other species’ ani-\nmal outcome-based welfare assessments.\nMethodology of the tool\nScoring criteria\nSEBWAT comprises 40 animal-based measures and four descriptive identifiers, in addition to\ntwo optional fields of animal and owner identification, and a free text section for additional\nA welfare assessmen t tool used on working equids in low and middle income countries\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01923 54 February 21, 2018 4 / 21\nobservations. Tables 1–6 describe the scoring for the parameters. S1 Appendix gives a full\ndescription of how each parameter is assessed.\nSampling\nSampling strategies to use the tool on a subset of a population are designed according to the\nrequirements of the region using it. Before 2015, in most contexts populations were sub-\ndivided according to geographical location, animal work type and species and sampling was\npurposive in order to obtain welfare data from all relevant equine groups. Since 2015 in most\nlocations and in some cases before, random sampling of individuals has been applied when\npossible. Logistical constraints of transport to remote areas, security, environmental condi-\ntions and limited resources, however, have meant that in practice convenience sampling is\nmost used; with those individuals that are willing or most accessible being assessed.

Scores are subsequently compared with those\nof the trainer to identify discrepancies and trends for errors, and feedback about this given to\ntrainees. Standardisation tests are intentionally conducted under stricter conditions than gen-\nuine field assessments, in which assessors can work in pairs without time restriction and have\nmore experience of SEBWAT and equine handling associated with it. Assessors conduct peri-\nodic re-standardisation with a central trainer to maintain consistency and standardisation\nwithin and between geographical areas, typically biennially.\nEthical statement\nEthical approval was not required as the assessment is non-invasive, observational and in-\nvolves minimal disruption of animals and owners from their normal routine. Verbal informed\nconsent is obtained from owners before commencing, when the purpose and nature of data\ncollection is explained. Animals are restrained using a correctly-fitted head-collar or halter, or\nthe animal’s own equipment/head-harness ing if safe and sufficiently comfortable to minimise\ndisturbance. They are handled by an experienced, trained handler. The owner is present dur-\ning assessment but does not directly interact with the animal after helping to prepare the ani-\nmal, to reduce biasing human interaction parameters and to promote welfare and human\nsafety. Data collection is non-invasive and only seven of the 40 animal-based measures require\nphysically touching the animal. Required contact is restricted to opening the mouth, picking\nup fore-hooves and lifting the tail; all interaction is reinforced positively through touch, such\nas stroking the neck (known to reduce heart rate) [44,45], rubbing between the eyes and vocal\npraise. Food rewards are not typically used during assessment to avoid creating an expectation\nfor the animal that treats will continue to be given after the assessment, or to owners that the\nNGO provides handouts. There are also practical barriers to transporting food to assess large\nnumbers of animals. If the animal becomes distressed or shows signs of a highly aroused nega-\ntive state then interaction causing the reaction is discontinued, but parameters which could be\nobserved from a distance are still recorded and the animal reassured. This affects a minimal\nnumber of individual animals per data collection, but is not formally recorded. The sequence\nof measures (differing to their presentation in Tables 1–6) was specifically designed to be effi-\ncient and minimise disruption for the animal. On completion, assessors can provide feedback\nto owners on the welfare strengths and weaknesses identified and give advice on any action\nrequired, including referral for treatment if necessary. Animals requiring emergency treatment\nhave this prioritised above welfare assessment; this is rare in practice. It is often necessary to\ngain permissions to work in the assessment areas, the nature of which varies according to the\nlocation and context. Examples include permissions from local chiefs or councils of village\nelders to work in a community, permissions from local government to work in particular dis-\ntricts, or permission from land owners to work on private land.\nData entry and analysis\nThree methods of data collection have been used. To begin, all data were collected manually\non paper and then transferred into the in-house database on return to an office. This pro-\ngressed in 2011 to some programmes using an electronic clipboard DigiMemo device using\nhandwritten records, which saved time by removing manual data entry and potentially\nreduced human error. Finally, in 2014 a purpose-built Android Tablet application (Brooke\nWelfare Assessment Android Application) was developed and implemented in some coun-\ntries. This allowed data to be uploaded electronically and removed the need for manual data\nentry. This increased accuracy compared to the electronic clipboard which depended on\nA welfare assessmen t tool used on working equids in low and middle income countries\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01923 54 February 21, 2018 9 / 21\nhandwriting recognition and provided digital access to the guidance manual for assessors,\nrather than carrying bulky paper manuals.\nData are uploaded onto a bespoke central database, for the organisation to securely store\nand use them long-term; the database is accessible remotely through an intranet system.\nDescriptive data and prevalence percentages with confidence intervals are typically sufficient\nto use the results to inform the NGO programmes. On occasion, inferential statistics have\nbeen used to answer more in-depth research questions.\nApplication of the tool at scale\nSEBWAT records have been generated for 71,865 equids in 11 countries, across South Asia,\nEast and West Africa, Central America, and the Middle East between December 2010 and\nDecember 2016. Data were utilised for a wide range of purposes, including needs assessment\nof the animals in new locations; prioritising which animal welfare issues to address; setting tar-\ngets, monitoring and evaluation of intervention projects; identifying the type and prevalence\nof welfare issues in equine populations; mapping trends in welfare issues by work seasons, cli-\nmate, work type, geographical area, owner demographic; and supporting field research,\nthrough providing data to inform research that considers the broader context around the ani-\nmals. The tool has been regularly used on a grand scale. Tables 7–9 shows the number of\nTable 7.

This region is arid, prone to drought\nand its inhabitants are largely dependent on subsistence farming and agricultural labour for\ntheir livelihood. Equine population information was extracted from a 2003 census by the Min-\nistry of Statistics, although this was recognized to be out of date. All animals that attended a\npre-announced meeting in each community with ESAP were assessed. Further animals found\nduring transect walks around each community were also assessed. The experience highlighted\none of the challenges of sampling in this kind of remote context, where many homes are widely\ndispersed in areas with limited access due to the hilly terrain and dirt roads, and the availability\nof owners and their working equids varied, requiring convenience sampling of meeting\nTable 8.

Further welfare issues were captured by talking to owners; these included castra-\ntion and soft palate removal procedures performed without anaesthesia or analgesia. Four\nhundred and two animals were assessed in 18 communities across the following municipalities\nof the department of Zacapa: Huite ´ (26% equids assessed / equid population estimate provided\nby community 98 /380), Estanzuela (21%, 21/100), Cabañas (7%, 9/130), San Jorge (72%, 163/\n225), Zacapa (34%, 85/250), and two communities in the department of Chiquimula (19%, 26/\n135). The most severe or prevalent issues across all animals sampled were body condition\n(41% underweight), hoof shape (41% abnormal in all limbs), gait (38% highly compromised),\nand adverse response to spinal contact (33% responded).\nThe results contributed to informing an evidence-based decision for Brooke to fund work\nby ESAP in the dry corridor region from 2016. By enabling the level of need of the animals in\ncomparison to other locations including programmes funded in Nepal, Jordan and Guatemala;\na decision was supported on how to allocate Brooke’s resources globally. ESAP withdrew from\nother locations in Guatemala where interventions were complete and moved into these two\nnew departments. The most prevalent welfare issues were identified and issues set out by com-\nmunity so that local interventions could be tailored. Other data used to inform the decision\nincluded the most recent equine population census and population data from the communi-\nties, and information gathered by ESAP on the clinical status of the equine animals and an\nowner questionnaire in separate visits to the same communities after conducting SEBWAT.\nCase example two: Monitoring welfare change over time in Jordan\nSEBWAT data were collected on three occasions over a period of six years by Brooke in Petra\nArchaeological Park and surrounding areas of Wadi Musa town and Um Sayhoun village, at\nthe animals’ usual places of work or accommodation.

Donkeys and mules were all unshod, and the majority of riding\nand carriage horses were shod with the standard u-shaped metal shoes, which helps to explain\nthe species differences in hoof parameters in Table 3. Training owners was amongst interven-\ntions conducted by Brooke, and riding and carriage horses were serviced by Brooke-trained\nfarriers. In April 2010 Brooke handed over its free veterinary clinic located at the Petra park to\nthe Jordan Ministry of Agriculture to encourage the sustainability of the service. The quality of\nthe government and private health services were targeted instead, through building capacity of\ngovernment vets, improving clinical supplies with the ministry and supporting improved qual-\nity of the Horse Owner Association farriers. A tourism campaign ‘Care for Petra’ was also run\nwith tourist industry representatives to influence tourist’s behaviour to support good treat-\nment of the equids being used in the Petra park. The reduction in hoof abnormalities over\ntime indicates improved farriery practices and owner use of the available services may have\ncontributed to the reduction in hoof abnormalities over time.\nThe reduction in hoof abnormalities over time indicates improved farriery practices and\nowner use of the available services may have contributed to the reduction in hoof abnormali-\nties over time, however this cannot be attributed without a case controlled study to exclude\nother factors. These SEBWAT parameters have contributed evidence to support programme\ndecision-making, for example for Brooke to withdraw direct intervention in Jordan due to sus-\ntained welfare improvements when Brooke’s intervention had been scaled back.\nDiscussion\nThe WEWA [31] was one of the first equine welfare assessment tools to be developed in a\nLMIC context and following its update to SEBWAT has been applied for six years internation-\nally across 11 countries, continuing to be used in more. To our knowledge, this has been the\nmost widely applied standardised welfare assessment for equine animals in LMICs.\nTable 10.

These\nspan the domains of welfare of nutrition, health, environment, behaviour and mental states\n[46]. Within the health domain, measures for welfare assessment have included lameness [47],\nsigns of illness [23] and back disorders [28]. Whilst Broster’s study [47] was conducted in\nLMICs, Hausberger et al’s [23, 25] and Lesimple et al’s studies [28, 29] were completed in\nHICs. SEBWAT is based on recording observable measures rather than a clinical diagnosis.\nTherefore disease diagnoses, such as clinical lameness, infectious diseases, or heat stress are\nnot captured in the tool, unlike Luna et al’s [48] that comprises a clinical examination. Within\nthe environment domain, measures have included heat stress and drinking water temperature\n[49, 50], in a study in a LMIC. Pritchard et al’s study [50] investigated validation of skin elastic-\nity indicators of dehydration against clinical pathology and concluded that skin elasticity was\nan unreliable indicator for use in the field. This indicator was therefore removed as part of the\ntransition from WEWA to SEBWAT. Within the behaviour domain, measures have included\nabnormal repetitive behaviour [24, 25, 29], play [51] and Qualitative Behavioural Assessment\n[18]. Within the mental states domain, measures have included gregariousness, nervousness,\nfear [27], pain [52], depression and inactivity [26]. Beyond the animals themselves, the socio-\neconomic, environmental and human behaviour factors that influence equine welfare have\nbeen studied, such as attributes of owners [53]. SEBWAT and other tools have been informed\nby these validation studies, which provide practitioners with the knowledge of reliable welfare\nindicators.\nEquine welfare assessment in high income countries\nSeveral welfare assessment protocols have been developed and applied in HICs which combine\ndifferent measures into a tool, with indicators from different domains forming an overall wel-\nfare assessment of an individual or group. In HICs there are typically more resources available,\nsuch as behaviour monitoring technology used in other species [54]. The AWIN protocol for\nhorses [12] and donkeys [14] is one example of an HIC assessment applied to equine animals\nin sport, leisure [16] and on farms [15]. It is shorter to complete than its predecessor Welfare\nQuality1 [1], which was also not validated for equids. The Horse Welfare Assessment Proto-\ncol (HWAP) [17] is a further HIC example, piloted on leisure riding horses. It benefits from\ncombining animal, resource and environment-based measures and identifying risk factors for\npoor welfare. The measures had high repeatability, however perhaps due to the scale of the\ntool only 22 animals can be assessed by one person in a working day. With SEBWAT a pair of\nassessors can assess up to 60 animals per working day, though as with any tool the cost, trans-\nport time to sites and disruption to owners’ work schedule require consideration. SEBWAT\ntraining involves a substantial one-off expense, to cover the cost of the trainer, trainees’ time\naway from their normal role, as well as travel and accommodation costs when applicable.\nWhere staff turnover and programme size permits, this expense can be offset by building\ncapacity of in-country teams to train their own assessors, rather than requiring an interna-\ntional trainer. This has been achieved in several Brooke country programmes, but depends on\nretention of the experienced trainers.\nEquine welfare assessment in low middle income countries\nIn contrast to HICs, welfare assessment tools must be tailored to take account of low resource\navailability and local context constraints to be used in LMICs. They are used for a wide range\nof purposes, from community engagement in animal welfare, to monitoring of programmes,\nA welfare assessmen t tool used on working equids in low and middle income countries\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01923 54 February 21, 2018 14 / 21\nto welfare needs assessments, and tools may be adapted to meet these different aims. They\nmust be quick to conduct to minimise the time owners and their animals are away from their\nwork, to increase the chance of them agreeing to participate. They should also have a very low\nvariable cost other than assessor time. It should also be noted that the quality of available and\naccessible equine appropriate healthcare may be lower than in HICs [55], which means that\nthere can be a lack of diagnostic tools to investigate issues once identified, or professionals\ntrained to treat an issue. SEBWAT was developed with these needs at its core. The only equip-\nment needed is a head collar and rope, clipboard or tablet device to record data and a hoof\npick. It can be taught and standardised with anyone who is literate and willing to safely and\ncompassionately handle animals; assessors do not require a scientific or veterinary back-\nground. There are no physiological measures, so that it is not limited by local availability of\nequipment or laboratory services to test clinical samples. It is quick to conduct in less than 10\nminutes per animal.\nAs with HIC assessments, SEBWAT results must be translated for lay audiences, including\nowners, due to its technical complexity. Assessment by an outside person risks reduced\nengagement with the findings more than if owners are able to participate and do an assessment\nthemselves, e.g. [56]. Brooke’s Participatory Animal Welfare Needs Assessment [57], for exam-\nple, is a tool used to engage communities with their animals’ welfare rather than to provide\nstandardised data. With SEBWAT, real-time feedback is provided to each owner about their\nanimal; some programmes combine positive feedback with a suggested aspect to improve for\neach owner. The time delay for full data analysis and returning on later visits, however, poten-\ntially hinders engagement with the wider community as compared with more participatory\napproaches.\nWelfare assessments in LMICs should enable organisations to be responsive to the local\ncountry, socio-economic contexts and community needs, and to allocate resources effectively.\nA condensed or re-categorised version of WEWA was applied across Afghanistan, Egypt, Ethi-\nopia, Guatemala, India, Jordan, Kenya, Pakistan, The Gambia [36], Romania [37, 58] and\nEgypt [59]. Since 2010 SEBWAT has been used in many of these locations again and Senegal,\nMexico, Nepal and Nicaragua in addition. The breadth of its indicators means it can be applied\nto different contexts without adaptation; conversely they could be reduced because not all indi-\ncators apply in all settings. In some cases, particularly the midpoint of projects, a subset of the\nSEBWAT indicators has been used to collect data only on the measures which are the focus of\nan intervention. Data from some measures have proved more useful than others; some have\nbeen globally useful (e.g. descriptors: age, species, sex, work type; body condition; lesion sever-\nity; observer approach, general attitude), whilst others have been specific to certain contexts\n(e.g. ectoparasites, firing, mutilations) and a few have rarely been prioritised or found central\nto programme decision making (e.g. size of lesions, tail tuck, respiratory noise). In examples of\ntools by others, direct observation, clinical examination and an owner interview were com-\nbined in Chile to assess urban draught horses [48]. The involvement of direct indicators and\nindirect indicators strengthens assessment; however clinical examination requires a veterinar-\nian, which limits a tool’s wider applicability. The ‘Hands-On Donkey Tool’ is a LMIC example\nthat was applied in Mexico [60]. It is less comprehensive which means there are less measures\nto collect and it has practical application to improve welfare. Some measures (e.g. the compos-\nite behaviour and ill health score), may require further validation in comparison to other exist-\ning tools.\nA further consideration for welfare assessment in LMIC contexts is that training for asses-\nsors typically requires knowledge and skills in welfare in order to use a tool, since these may\nnot have been taught during previous education. For SEBWAT training usually lasts 10 days,\nor 5 days using blended learning with the theory preparation in advance. The practical\nA welfare assessmen t tool used on working equids in low and middle income countries\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01923 54 February 21, 2018 15 / 21\ncomponent of training includes animal handling, in contrast to most farm welfare assessment\ntraining. Handling animals during assessment enables some parameters to be observed more\naccurately and enables assessors to set positive handling examples with owners. The limitation\nis that training takes longer. Following training, tools must be used regularly to maintain these\nskills, which is typically at least once a year for SEBWAT. Assessors must reach 80% agreement\nwith the SEBWAT trainer to pass and periodic re-standardisation takes place to use the tool.\nUse of SEBWAT to inform field work and assess impact\nThe main purpose of welfare assessment tools is to assess and ultimately improve animal wel-\nfare, though they are used for other purposes such as legal compliance. Welfare assessment\ndata should contribute to monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment of animal welfare\nprogrammes, whether they are NGO, government, or industry-led. This function is well\nestablished in human development organisations, but so far has been limited in the animal\nwelfare sector [61]. How welfare assessments are applied and used to inform change is a key\nstage in the welfare improvement process, but is currently under represented in published lit-\nerature. SEBWAT has and continues to provide animal-based data on major welfare issues of\nworking equids, to determine the scale of the issues and prioritise whether interventions are\nrequired. In combination with other tools, SEBWAT findings have informed decisions around\nwhat type of interventions were required based on the issues. Farriery interventions were\nhighlighted as a requirement in Ethiopia and Jordan due to a high prevalence of hoof prob-\nlems, for instance.\nData collected by NGOs should be used to inform research questions due to its practical rel-\nevance and insights, as has been done for SEBWAT by field research programmes [62,63] and\nuniversities. Welfare assessment data can also be used to inform briefings for policy makers at\ngovernments and institutions. For example, SEBWAT data informed the discussion of envi-\nronmental, human labour and animal welfare concerns in the South Asian brick kiln industry\n[64]. The implementation of the World Organisation for Animal Health Terrestrial Animal\nHealth Code chapter on Welfare of Working Equids [65] could also use welfare assessments to\nidentify priority issues. As well as pre-planned programmatic work, welfare assessment data\ncan also usefully inform interventions by NGOs to address both slow-onset problems such as\ndrought, as well as emergencies such as earthquakes or flooding. They can be used to support\nmonitoring of interventions to address the secondary effects of political instability which for\nexample, may result in reductions in income generated by animals used in tourism and their\nowners’ capacity to afford to buy animal feed. Examples of the use of SEBWAT for these situa-\ntions have been generated in Afghanistan, Egypt, Senegal and Nicaragua. Evidence from his-\ntorical datasets can be compared to the current conditions of the equids and new assessments\ncarried out to gather the extent of need, for example to inform decisions to provide emergency\nfeed and water according to body condition.\nSEBWAT limitations\nLimitations of SEBWAT include that technical knowledge and skills are required for data han-\ndling and interpretation. Time is required for data handling subsequent to data collection, dur-\ning which there is risk of human error if this is done manually rather than using a tablet\napplication. Data management does not have to be performed by assessors, but further training\nspecific for this may be useful to improve engagement of assessors with the findings and to\nassist with context-appropriate data interpretation. Large scale data collection is demanding\nwithin the often challenging environmental conditions and due to the requirement for animal\nhandling, therefore assessors need to be physically fit. SEBWAT results are recorded at one\nA welfare assessmen t tool used on working equids in low and middle income countries\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01923 54 February 21, 2018 16 / 21\nbrief moment in time and do not capture the duration of an experience or events at other life\nstages, therefore they do not inform Quality of Life or cumulative lifetime experience [66, 67].\nAssessing quality of life requires steps beyond welfare assessment, where information from dif-\nferent sources should inform a practitioner’s opinion, especially for treatment decisions [68].\nFor example, SEBWAT does not capture what happens at the end of an equid’s life, yet the\nmethods of slaughter [69], euthanasia [70] and abandonment [71] are serious welfare concerns\nfor working equids.\nAs an animal-outcome based tool, omissions of SEBWAT include issues related to resource\ninputs and human behaviour, as well as details of the root causes of the welfare issues. There-\nfore SEBWAT results should be triangulated with data from other sources. These are identified\nthrough separate community engagement sessions and tools on Owner Behaviour Monitoring\n[72], Animal Healthcare Mentoring [73] and anecdotal observations by assessors. A combined\noverall welfare score is not made within SEBWAT due to the challenge of objectively weighting\ndifferent measures against each other and the loss of detail that informs field-based decisions,\nalthough other welfare assessments tools have done this [67]. Such weighting involves an ethi-\ncal value-based, rather than scientific judgement [74].\nUse of welfare assessment tools to inform positive change\nThe importance of positive welfare is increasingly recognised, as the sector recognises that ani-\nmals require positive experiences for a good life, beyond minimising suffering [75]. Welfare\nassessments should aim to incorporate this change of approach wherever possible. Due to sci-\nentific opinion at the time it was created and its purpose to measure equine welfare in LMICs,\nthe focus of SEBWAT is predominantly on negative aspects of equine welfare. Although some\npositive aspects are captured, such as alert and relaxed behaviour in response to an observer\napproach or general attitude and healthy body condition score, most measures are negative, or\nthe absence of a negative result. Positive opportunities or choice can be measured through\npreference testing of animals [76]. Due to the difficulty of measuring animal affective states,\nlimited measures available [77] and the prevalence of health-related issues, the majority of\nindicators in current welfare assessment tools, including SEBWAT, are negative, physical indi-\ncators of welfare. All welfare assessment tools should be regularly reviewed and updated for\ntheir validity, practicality and usefulness to inform positive change in the local context,\nwhether for LMICs or HICs.\nConclusion\nSEBWAT has been developed and applied on the largest scale known to date of any equine\nwelfare assessment tool, and is unique in that it has been widely applied in LMICs. The tool\nmay be useful to others working in LMIC contexts with working equids, who wish to identify\nkey welfare issues, track changes over time or reveal associations between different aspects of\nwelfare with the surrounding environment. Results have been useful to inform an NGO’s\ninterventions, monitoring, evaluation and impact assessments, as well as scientific research\nand government and institutional policy. In practice, the tool is quick to use per animal and\ncomprehensive in content, but it reflects some of the barriers applicable to other welfare assess-\nment tools through requiring intensive training to carry out, and analysis requires an under-\nstanding of data. SEBWAT focuses solely on the animal, which benefits from capturing animal\noutcome-based data, but therefore requires additional effort to triangulate the results with\nowner- and resource-based data and to engage the owners in their animal’s welfare. SEBWAT\nfocuses on select negative, physical and behavioural indicators of equine welfare and does not\ncapture all the factors that affect welfare throughout an equid’s life. Therefore it may need to\nA welfare assessmen t tool used on working equids in low and middle income countries\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01923 54 February 21, 2018 17 / 21\nevolve again in the future to reflect emerging science on positive animal welfare and cumula-\ntive life experience, but will crucially need to retain its practicality and usability for different\ncontexts, including LMICs, to remain useful.\nSupporting information\nS1 Appendix.
