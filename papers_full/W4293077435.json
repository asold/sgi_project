Introduction \nWith the continuous improvement of national mechanization development level, the \nrelationship between each equipment becomes in tricate and complex, and the consequences \nbrought by equipment failure will be unpredictable, so mechanical fault diagnosis technology has \nbeen highly valued by scholars.  However, how to take accurate  and efficient fault diagnosis \nmethod for mechanical equipment has been one of  the first problems consid ered in the field of \nmechanical engineering. As the core component of the whole system, the power transformer \nequipment operates as an inseparable part of the whole power grid. Once the mechanical failure \nof the power transformer occurs, it will bring a great damage to the people as well as to the national \nproperty, so a research of power transformer is of the utmost importance. In this paper, the study \nis carried out from the perspective of transformer fault identification and diagnosis. Y. Sun et al. \n[1] proposed to use a BP neural network for a transformer fault diagnosis, through the neural \nnetwork could effectively improve the fault. X. Yang et al. [2] proposed a neural network based \non the BP-PNN for a transformer fault diagnosis, and proposed a dual fusion approach based on \nthe BP and PNN for a fault feature identification,  and then the simulation experiments showed \nthat if used, the neural network had a better re cognition effect. S. Fei et al. [3] proposed an \nidentification idea consisting in optimizing the support vector machine based on the genetic \nalgorithm, which was applied to optimize the pa rameters of support vector machine, thus \nimproving the prediction performance of support vector machine. T. Kari et al. [4] proposed a \nhybrid feature selection method for power transformer fault diagnosis based on support vector \nmachine and genetic algorithm, which had better resu lts in extracting features. S. F. Cheng et al. \n[5] applied a wavelet neural network with improved particle swarm algorithm in transformer fault \ndiagnosis, using the powerful ability of wavelet neural network to identify features for prediction, \n\nRESEARCH ON IGOA-LSSVM BASED FAULT DIAGNOSIS OF POWER TRANSFORMERS.  \nYUNSHENG CHEN \n ISSN PRINT 1392-8716, ISSN ONLINE 2538-8460 1263 \nand optimizing wavelet neural network parameters using an improved particle swarm algorithm. \nSimulation experiments illustrated that the neural network had better results in transformer fault \ndiagnosis. B. Zeng et al. [6] proposed to optimize a LSSVM neural network by using the wolf \nswarm algorithm, simulation experiments illustrate d a significant improvement in fault feature \nrecognition through the optimized LSSVM neural network. R. Naresh et al. [7] proposed an \nintegrated neuro-fuzzy method for transformer fault diagnosis, which had a good effect for \nidentifying transformer mechanical faults. L. Dong  et al. [8] used a rough set and fuzzy wavelet \nneural network combined with the least squares weighted fusion algorithm in power transformer \nfault detection, which combined roughly set and wavelet neural fusion to improve the transformer \nfault diagnosis accuracy. P. Purkait et al. [9] proposed an expert system for transformer impulse \nfault diagnosis based on the time-frequency domain analysis, with the perspective to involve also \nthe time frequency domain analysis to carry out th e fault prediction study. D. Ma et al. [10] \nintroduced an expert system for a fault diagnosis of power system based on a BP neural network, \nwhich mainly fuses multiple BP neural networks to predict and analyze the possible faults of \npower transformer equipment with the help of  similar expert system, and the simulation \nexperiment showed that the diagnosis system had a good effect. M. Demetgul et al. [11] proposed \nto use Gustafson-Kessel (GK) and k-medoids algorithm for fault clustering with an accuracy of \nabout 90 %. Y. Miao et al. [12] proposed to use improved Blind deconvolution methods in fault \ndiagnosis and described the prospects of application. W. Deng et al. [13] proposed a novel \ncompound fault diagnosis method based on the optimized maximum correlation kurtosis \ndeconvolution (MCKD) and sparse representation. The simulation experiments illustrated that the \nmethod allowed extracting the compound fault char acteristics of rolling bearings and achieving \naccurate compound fault diagnosis. Q. Song et al. [14] proposed a multi-scale convolutional neural \nnetwork (MSCNN) combined with a matrix diagram for chemical process fault diagnosis method, \nand simulation experiments illustrated that the algorithm had a good application perspective. \nHaving summarized the above literature research  with different solutio ns to identify power \ntransformer equipment faults, using neural networks to assist in equipment fault resolution, the \nauthors of this paper determined the main direction that most scholars were still researching. But \nwhile the neural network parameter settings are the key factor for equipment diagnosis for this \ngoal, combined with the basis of some scholars’ research, this paper proposes a locust \noptimization-based algorithm with a least square s vector machine optimization model, uses a \nlocust algorithm to select the optimal parameter model, and finally applies the ready solution for \nthe equipment fault diagnosis of power transfor mers. Simulation experiments illustrate that the \ndiagnosis model has a good prediction effect. \n2. Basic algorithm description \n2.1. Grasshopper optimization algorithm \nSaremi [15], an Australian scholar, proposed the Grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) \nbased on the swarming behavior of Grasshoppers, which is divided into two parts, exploration and \nexploitation, where the exploration part corresponds to the larval stage of Grasshoppers and the \nexploitation part corresponds to the adult stag e of Grasshoppers. In the larval stage, the \nGrasshoppers move to a small area, which is good for a local search . In the adult stage, \nGrasshoppers move to a small area, which fac ilitates a local search. The individual positions of \nGrasshopper populations are influenced by popula tion interaction, gravitational forces and wind \nforces during reproduction, foraging and migration: \n𝑋௜ = 𝑟ଵ𝑆௜ + 𝑟ଶ𝐺௜ + 𝑟ଷ𝐴௜, (1)\nwhere, 𝑋௜ denotes the position of the 𝑖th Grasshopper, 𝑆௜ denotes the influence of the 𝑖th \nGrasshopper by the interaction force of other Grasshoppers, 𝐺௜ is the influence of the 𝑖th \nRESEARCH ON IGOA-LSSVM BASED FAULT DIAGNOSIS OF POWER TRANSFORMERS.  \nYUNSHENG CHEN \n1264 JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING. NOVEMBER 2022, VOLUME 24, ISSUE 7  \nGrasshopper by the gravitational force, 𝐴௜ is the influence of the 𝑖th Grasshopper by the wind \nforce, and 𝑟ଵ, 𝑟ଶ, 𝑟ଷ are random numbers which take the va lue of [0, 1], respectively, in the \nequation as follows: \n𝑆௜ = ෍𝑠(𝑑௜௝)𝑑መ௜௝\n௄\n௝ୀଵ\n௝ஷ௜\n, (2)\nwhere 𝐾 denotes the number of Grasshoppers, 𝑑௜௝ =| 𝑥௝ −𝑥௜| denotes the distance between the 𝑖, \n𝑗th of two Grasshoppers. 𝑑መ௜௝ =( 𝑥௝ −𝑥௜) 𝑑௜௝⁄  denotes the unit vector from 𝑖 Grasshopper to the \n𝑗th Grasshopper, and 𝑠 denotes the influence function between the Grasshoppers subjected to the \ninteraction force with other Grasshoppers, expressed as follows: \n𝑠(𝑟) = 𝑓𝑒\nି௥\n௟ −𝑒 ି௥. (3)\nIn Eq. (3), when 𝑠(𝑟) is greater than 0, Grasshoppers will attract each other, so the range of 𝑟 \nis called the attraction domain, when 𝑠(𝑟) is less than 0, Grasshopper s will repel each other, so \nthe range of 𝑟 is called the repulsion domain; when 𝑠(𝑟) is 0, Grasshoppers will neither attract nor \nrepel each other, so 𝑟 is the comfortable di stance. In addition, 𝑓 and 𝑙 represent the attraction \nstrength parameter and the scale parameter, respec tively, and their values affect the domains of \nattraction, repulsion and moderate distribution distances, generally 𝑙 is 1.5 and 𝑓 is 0.5: \n𝐺௥ = −𝑔𝑒̂௚, (4)\n𝐴௜ = 𝑢𝑒̂௪. (5)\nIn Eq. (4), 𝑔 denotes the gravitational constant, 𝑒̂௚ denotes the unit vector pointing at the center \nof the earth; in Eq. (5), 𝑢 denotes the wind direction constant, 𝑒̂௪ denotes the wind direction unit \nvector, so the Grasshopper individual position is updated as follows: \n𝑋௜ = ෍𝑠(|𝑥௝ −𝑥௜|) 𝑥௝ −𝑥௜\n𝑑௜௝\n−𝑔𝑒̂௚ +\n௄\n௝ୀଵ\n௝ஷ௜\n𝑢𝑒̂௪. (6)\nAlthough Eq. (6) is used to simulate the Grasshopper population, from the aspect of practical \napplication, the gravitational factor is usually not considered, and the wind direction is determined \nto point at the target location, so the best individual Grasshopper location is solved as the \noptimization problem. The formula is shown below: \n𝑋௜\nௗ = 𝑝\n⎩\n⎨\n⎧\n෍𝑝 𝑢𝑏ௗ −𝑙𝑏ௗ\n2 𝑠(|𝑥௝\nௗ −𝑥௜\nௗ|) 𝑥௝ −𝑥௜\n𝑑௜௝\n௄\n௝ୀଵ\n௝ஷ௜ ⎭\n⎬\n⎫\n+ 𝑇෠ௗ, (7)\n𝑝 = 𝑝୫ୟ୶ −𝑡 × 𝑝୫ୟ୶ −𝑝୫୧୬\n𝑇୫ୟ୶\n, (8)\nwhere, 𝑢𝑏ௗ and 𝑙𝑏ௗ correspond to the upper and lower bounds of the 𝑖th Grasshopper in the 𝑑th \ndimension respectively, 𝑇෠ௗ is the target position of the Grasshopper swarm, 𝑝 in Eq.

LSSVM \nLeast squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is a deformation algorithm for automatic \nvector machines that uses a least squares loss function instead of an insensitive loss function to \nconvert the quadratic programming problem in automatic vector machine training into a set of \nlinear equations solution problem, thus greatly reducing the complexity and speeding up the \nsolution while ensuring the accuracy speed. \nLet the training sample set for the binary classification problem be: \n𝑆 = ሼ(𝑥\n௜, 𝑦௜),   𝑥௜ ∈𝑅 ௡,   𝑦௜ ∈ ሼ−1, +1ሽ,   𝑖 =1 , 2 ,⋯𝑛ሽ, (9)\nwhere, 𝑥௜ denotes the 𝑖th input sample, 𝑦௜ is the category label relative to 𝑥௜, and 𝑛 is the number \nof samples. First, the samples to be classi fied are mapped to the high-dimensional space by \nintroducing a nonlinear function, and then the optimal decision function is constructed in the high-\ndimensional space as follows: \n𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑤௧𝜑(𝑥) + 𝑏, (10)\nwhere, 𝑤 is the weight vector, 𝜑(𝑥) is the mapping function, and 𝑏 is a constant, so the \noptimization function of the least squares vector machine is: \nmin\nఠ,క,௕\n1\n2 ‖𝜔‖ଶ + 𝑐1\n2 ෍𝜉ଶ\nெ\n௜ୀଵ\n,\n𝑠. 𝑡.\n𝑥′௟ = 𝜔்𝜙(𝑅ᇱ\n௟) + 𝑏+ 𝜉௟,\n (11)\nwhere, 𝜍 is the relaxation variable, and 𝑐 is the regularization parameter. \nThe current LSSVM has many kernel functions, and its radial basis function has the advantages \nof parameters, generality, etc. In this paper, the authors choose it as the kernel function of LSSVM, \nwhich is determined as follows: \n𝐾(𝑅\nᇱ\n௠, 𝑅ᇱ\n௡) =e x pቆ−‖𝑅ᇱ\n௠, 𝑅ᇱ\n௡‖ଶ\n2𝜎ଶ ቇ,      (𝑚, 𝑛 = 1 , 2 ,..., 𝑀). (12)\nBy introducing the Lagrange operators 𝑎 and 𝑏, Eq.

IGOA \nLike most meta-heuristic algorithms, the Grasshopper algorithm will also have some \nshortcomings such as falling into local optimality, slow algorithm convergence, and low solution \naccuracy. In order to improve the performance of the GOA algorithm and better optimize the \nLSSVM parameters, this paper proposes a self-learning factor, proportional weight coefficient and \nimproved Grasshopper optimization algorithm for Levy flight. \n3.1. Self-learning factor \nIn the Grasshopper algorithm, the Grasshopper is subject to the influence function between the \ninteraction force with other Grasshoppers is the key to the Grasshopper individual position \nmovement, with the increasing number of iterati ons, the coefficient of attractiveness of the 𝑖th \nGrasshopper individual with other Grasshoppers becomes the key to influence the position, \ntherefore, this paper improves the adaptive learning of attractiveness as follows: \n𝑓 = 𝑓୫୧୬ + (𝑓୫ୟ୶ −𝑓୫୧୬) × (1 −cos(1 −𝑡 𝑇୫ୟ୶⁄ )) 𝜋⁄ , (15)\nwhere, 𝑓୫ୟ୶ and 𝑓୫୧୬ denote the maximum and minimum values of the adaptive learning factor, 𝑡 \nand 𝑇୫ୟ୶ are the number of current iterations and the maximum number of iterations, respectively. \nIt is found from the formula that with the gradual increase in the number of iterations, it is effective \nin the early stage of the algorithm to avoid ot her Grasshopper individuals congregating at once, \nthus avoiding individuals falling into the local optimum, avoiding missing some extreme values \nof individuals, as well as avoiding the appearance of regions that may not be searched. \n3.2. Proportional weight coefficient optimization \nIn order to further improve the local search and global optimum capability of the traditional \nGrasshopper algorithm, this paper combines Eq . (1) and Eq. (7), and optimizes the weight \ncoefficients 𝑟\nଵ and 𝑟ଶ respectively in the actual situation, with the following optimization \nexpression: \n𝑟ଵ = 𝑟୫ୟ୶ −൬2 −𝑒\n௧\n௧ౣ౗౮൰× (𝑟୫ୟ୶ −𝑟୫୧୬). (16)\n𝑟ଶ = 𝑟୫୧୬ + ൬2 −𝑒\n௧\n௧ౣ౗౮൰× (𝑟୫ୟ୶ −𝑟୫୧୬). (17)\nThe two proportional weight coefficients have  an impact on the location of Grasshopper \nindividuals. In the early stage of the algorithm, because the value of 𝑟ଵ is larger, so 𝑟ଵ > 𝑟ଶ, \nGrasshopper individuals approach the global optimal individual faster, which is beneficial to the \nglobal search, and in the middle and late stage of the algorithm, the value of 𝑟ଵ is smaller, and so \n𝑟ଵ < 𝑟ଶ. Grasshopper individuals are located in a si milar area to the global optimal Grasshopper \nindividuals, which is beneficial to the local search, and maintains the diversity of the population. \nThis dynamic balance between the local search  and the global optimum of the Grasshopper \nalgorithm effectively avoids the premature convergence of the algorithm. \n3.3. Levy flight optimization and individual optimization search \nA. M. Edwards [16] in the study of bionic animals found that bionic animals were those that \nadvanced randomly in an arbitrary dimensional space in any direction for any length of moment \ndeparture, and this behavioral feature was called Levy flight feature. This flight characteristic can \nperform local search in a small range on one hand and global search in a large range on the other \nhand, and such an operation can effectively balance the relationship between the global and local \nRESEARCH ON IGOA-LSSVM BASED FAULT DIAGNOSIS OF POWER TRANSFORMERS.  \nYUNSHENG CHEN \n ISSN PRINT 1392-8716, ISSN ONLINE 2538-8460 1267 \nones. The distribution density function of Levy flight step variation can be approximated as \nfollows: \n𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑦(𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝)~|𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝|ିଵିఉ,0 < 𝛽≤ 2, (18)\nwhere, 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝 is the random motion step of Levy’s flight behavior, expressed as follows: \n𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝 = 𝜇/|𝑣|\nଵ\nఉ. (19)\nParameter 𝜇, 𝑣 follows the normal distribution: \n𝜇~𝑁൫0, 𝜎ఓ\nଶ൯,     𝑣~𝑁(0, 𝜎௩\nଶ), (20)\nwhere: \n𝜎ఓ = ൜ Γ(1 + 𝛽)sin(𝜋𝛽/2)\nΓ[(1 + 𝛽)/2]𝛽2(ఉିଵ)/ଶൠ\nଵ/ఉ\n,      𝜎௩ =1 .  \nFrom the behavior of Levy flight features, Grasshoppers also have such behavior during \nforaging, especially when other Grasshopper individuals approaches the current individual, which \ncan very easily lead the algorithm to a local optimum situation. So to avoid this situation, the Levy \naircraft mechanism is introduced in the foraging behavior of the algorithm with the following \nequation: \n𝑋௜ = ෍𝑠(|𝑥௝ −𝑥௜|) 𝑥௝ −𝑥௜\n𝑑௜௝\n−𝑔𝑒̂௚ +\n௄\n௝ୀଵ\n௝ஷ௜\n𝑢𝑒̂௪ + 𝑎(𝑡) ⋅s𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑) ⊕𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝. (21)\nwhere, 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 is a random number between [–1, 1], s𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑) is the Levy flight direction as \nshown in Eq. (22), and 𝑎(𝑡) is the scale factor as shown in Eq. (23): \ns𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑) = ൜1,            𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 ≥0,\n−1,     𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 <0 ,    −1 ≤𝑟 𝑎 𝑛 𝑑≤1, (22)\n𝑎(𝑡) = 𝑎௜௡௜௧ ×e x p൬ 𝑡\n𝑇୫ୟ୶\n൰, (23)\nwhere, 𝑡 is the current number of iterations, and 𝑎௜௡௜௧ is the initial scale factor. It is found from \nEq. that the use of the Levy flight feature enables the GOA to perform a small range search at the \nbeginning of the algorithm and then a large range random search, ensuring that the GOA searches \nin different ranges, which can approximate the global optimal solution. Therefore, the use of the \nLevy flight feature can prevent the algorithm from oscillating around the optimal value and obtain \nthe optimal solution as soon as possible. \n3.4. Algorithm flow \nThe IGOA algorithm flow is shown in Fig. 1. \n4. IGOA-LSSVM based device fault identification steps \nThe improved GOA and LSSVM for state predic tion of power mechanical equipment is to \nbuild a nonlinear model between the input and output quantities, which core is to determine two \nimportant parameters 𝑐 and 𝜎 in the LSSVM, which have a very significant impact on the \nRESEARCH ON IGOA-LSSVM BASED FAULT DIAGNOSIS OF POWER TRANSFORMERS.  \nYUNSHENG CHEN \n1268 JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING.

To set the \nrelevant parameters of the LSSVM neural network, it is required to form a set of parameters 𝑐and \n𝜎 in the LSSVM, and compare the set of parameters with the Grasshopper individuals one by one, \nso that the best set of parameters can be obtained by involving the optimal Grasshopper \nindividuals, that is, the optimal parameters of the LSSVM. \nStep 2: Optimize each of the th ree improved strategies in GO A according to the improved \nthree-ratio method. \nStep 3: In the Grasshopper algorithm individual fitness function, the middle decision function \nis used in LSSVM, and in the iteration process, the individual fitness value of the Grasshopper is \ncompared with the current individual optimal fitness value, and if the former fitness value is better \nthan the latter, the latter is directly replaced; otherwise, it remains unchanged. \nStep 4: When the algorithm reaches the maximum number of iterations, the algorithm ends, so \nthe optimal Grasshopper individuals correspond to the optimal 𝑐 and 𝜎. \nBegin\nInitialization parameters\nUpdate Equation (3) with Equation \n(14)\nUpdate Equation (1) with Equation \n(15-16)\nUpdate Equation (6) with Equation \n(19)\nSatisfy end \ncondition\nNo\nEnd\nYes\n \nFig. 1.

Moreover, respective parameters and set for 100 iterations are selected for these \nalgorithms, and the simulation results are obtai ned with the help of Matlab2012 simulation \nplatform as shown in Table 2. \nTable 1.

The difference \nbetween the two algorithms gradually increases as the dimensionality increases, and when the \ndimensionality reaches 30 dimensions, the optimal value and variance of the two algorithms \ngradually increase, and the difference between the tw o algorithms is larger when it is in the F1 \nand F3 functions. From Table 2, it can be found that IGOA has better performance compared with \nthe GOA algorithm, which also evidences that the improved IGOA can significantly improve the \nperformance of the algorithm, especially in the higher dimensionality.

Fault diagnosis \nThe internal faults of transformers can be main ly classified into elect rical and thermal faults \naccording to their fault phenomena. Therefore, the fault causes are generally divided into high \ntemperature overheating, medium and low temperature overheating, high-energy discharge, low-\nenergy discharge and partial discharge. When a fault occurs in a transformer, hydrogen, methane, \nethylene, acetylene and other gase s dissolve in the insulating oil of the transformer, and the \nspecific type of fault in the transformer is dete rmined based on the content of these gases in the \noil. Therefore, data collection and sample classification are carried out in this paper. \n5.2.1. Sample collection \nSince the operating condition of a transformer is directly related to the content of dissolved \ngases in the oil, representative data samples are selected here for model creation. Due to the great \nvariability and dispersion between the volumes of various gas components, the input data for \ntraining are first pre-processed here in order to reduce the impact caused by the  \nRESEARCH ON IGOA-LSSVM BASED FAULT DIAGNOSIS OF POWER TRANSFORMERS.  \nYUNSHENG CHEN \n ISSN PRINT 1392-8716, ISSN ONLINE 2538-8460 1271 \norder-of-magnitude differences between them and to speed up the training. In this paper, the \ntraining and test sets are processed by normalization, and the specific formulas are shown below: \n𝑋ത = 𝑥௜ −𝑥୫୧୬\n𝑥୫ୟ୶ −𝑥୫୧୬\n, (24)\nwhere, 𝑥௜ denotes the original raw gas data, 𝑥୫ୟ୶ and 𝑥୫୧୬ denote the maximum and minimum \nvalues of the raw gas data, respectively, and 𝑋ത denotes the normalized gas data. \n5.2.2. Sample classification \nAccording to the improved three-ratio method of gas characteristics, this paper divides the \ntransformer operating status into 6 categories, namely, high-energy discharge, low-energy \ndischarge, high temperature overheating, medium and low temperature overheating, partial \ndischarge, and normal state. In addition, it introduces the corresponding coding system, which is \nshown in Table 3. Through the model in this paper, the optimized penalty factor 𝑐 and the kernel \nheight basis function parameter group 𝜎 are used to train the model using the training samples in \nthe original DGA [17] data, and the test samples are used to test and evaluate the model. \nTable 3. Sample classification \nNo Categor y \n1 High-energy discharge \n2 Low-ener gy discharge \n3 High temperature overheating \n4 Medium to low temperature overheating \n5 Partial dischar ge \n6 Normal state \n5.2.3. Example analysis \nIn order to verify finally that the transformer’s mechanical fault diagnosis model based on \nthe improved algorithm optimized support vector machine proposed in this paper is equally \neffective when more data are available. Here in this paper, 260 sets of DGA data collected are \nclassified according to the procedure from Table 4. Among the 260 sets of sample data collected, \nthey are divided into six categories, of which 170 sets of sample data are available in the training \nset, and the remaining 90 sets are used as the test set sample data. Among them, 1-45 belong to \nthe first category (high-energy discharge), 46-90 belong to the second category (low-energy \ndischarge), 91-135 belong to the third category (high-temperature overheating), 136-180 belong \nto the fourth category (medium- low temperature overheating), 181-225 belong to the fifth \ncategory (partial discharge), and 226-260 belong to the sixth category (normal state). And in the \nfirst five operating states of the original DGA data grouped into 30 groups as the training set, the \nother 1-55 groups as the test set; from the sixth operating state of the data grouped into 20 groups \nas the training set, and the remaining 1-5 groups were put into the test set. The specific training \nset and test set sample labels are shown in Table 4.  \nTable 4.

The table demonstrates that the algorithm in this \npaper has good results in six fault cases, with the average detection rate above 93 %. Thus, the \nIGOA-LSSVM proposed in this paper has good results in the detection process, although the \nrecognition accuracy in high te mperature overheating is lowe r than 90 %, i.e. the gas \nRESEARCH ON IGOA-LSSVM BASED FAULT DIAGNOSIS OF POWER TRANSFORMERS.  \nYUNSHENG CHEN \n1272 JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING.

Comparison of diagnosis effect \nIn order to illustrate further the effectiveness of the algorithm in diagnostic prediction, this \npaper selected the least squares vector machine based on the Ant colony algorithm and the least \nsquares vector machine based on the Particle swarm algorithm for comparison with the algorithm \napplied in this paper.

As can be derived from Fig. 4, when the PSO-LSSVM model is used for \ntransformer fault diagnosis, no fault appears in the high-energy discharge diagnosis, only one low \nenergy discharge diagnosis error but no fault. Two high temperature overheating diagnosis errors \nalso appear without a fault. Two medium and low temperature overheating diagnoses revealed no \nfault, only one partial discharge diagnosis er ror without fault. So the comprehensive fault \ndiagnosis rate is 88 %. As can be derived from Fig. 5, when the IABC-LSSVM model is applied \nfor a transformer fault diagnosis, the high-energy discharge diagnosis and the low-energy \ndischarge diagnosis reveal no fault. One high-temperature overheating diagnosis error appears \nwithout fault. Only two medium and low-temperature overheating diagnoses and one partial \ndischarge diagnosis revealed errors without fault. The comprehensive fault diagnosis rate is 92 %. \nTherefore, from the results in Fig. 3-Fig. 5, the IGOA-LSSVM proposed in this paper has a good \neffect for diagnosing faults. \n6. Conclusions \nTo improve the ability to identify mechanical faults in power transformers, the authors propose \nan IGOA-LSSVM fault diagnosis model based on the IGOA. To improve the prediction of \nLSSVM, they created an IGOA model based on GOA algorithm using three strategies: \nself-learning factor, proportional weight coefficient and Levy flight, and used it to optimize the \nLSSVM parameters. In the simulation experime nts, the IGOA-LSSVM has better recognition \neffect compared with ACO-LSSM and PSO-LSSVM models for the identification of five power \ntransformer faults. In the next step, the authors are going to improve further the fault diagnosis \nmethod. \nReferences \n[1] Y .-J. Sun, S. Zhang, C.-X. Miao, and J.-M.
