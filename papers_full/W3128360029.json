This action\nchanges the power ﬂow in the grid, and thus its voltage pro-\nﬁle. However, the synchronization between two grid is not\nstraightforward, since their respective voltages are initially\nnon-synchronized, with different voltage amplitude and phase,\nand, eventually, frequency: an uncontrolled synchronization\ncan lead to large power ﬂow in-rush in the connecting line [1].\nSpeciﬁcally, in this article the focus is on the synchronization\nprocess between one low voltage (LV) grid fed by a con-\nventional transformer and one by a Smart Transformer (ST).\nThe ST, a medium voltage (MV)/LV power electronics-based\ntransformer, is considered as one of the most promising tech-\nnologies to facilitate the integration of renewable sources and\nelectric vehicles in the grid. Its advanced controllers enable the\nprovision of grid services, that go beyond the simple voltage\nlevel transformation [2]–[5].\nSynchronization issues between power electronics-devices\nand the grid can be found in the microgrid reconnection with\nthe mains after islanding [6]. However, in microgrids sev-\neral energy sources contribute to support the grid according\nto their power rating. Most of the power converters work in\ngrid-forming mode, providing voltage and frequency stability,\nbut they are usually supported by converters that work in grid-\nfollowing mode, usually fed by non-programmable sources. In\ncase of abrupt reconnection, the microgrid can still be sup-\nported by the main grid, which is often considered as a stiff\ngrid. On the opposite, in the case of ST-fed and conventional\ntransformer-fed grids, the ST is in charge of supplying its own\nloads before the closure of the NOP, that are comparable to\nthe conventional transformer ones. In case of abrupt connec-\ntion, the ST can overload, and the grid-forming converter shuts\ndown. As a consequence, the conventional transformer has to\nprovide power to the loads of two grids, leading to its over-\nload and following shut down. A further issue is represented\nby considering a fast communication infrastructure, that is a\npossibility for microgrids in the next years [7], but it is not\navailable in the current distribution network. Instead, the ST\ntechnology can be ready as soon as in the next couple of years,\nas planned by the OFGEM-funded project “LV engine” [8],\nwhere 6 STs will be integrated in the Scottish grid\nby 2022.\nUnder these assumptions, a seamless transition strategy is\nvital for safe and reliable operation of Smart and conven-\ntional transformers.

S\nTATE OF THE ART\nA. Seamless Transition\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the seamless transition\ntopic has been deeply examined in recent literature, partic-\nularly regarding the microgrid reconnection with the main\ngrid. Nonetheless, some existing works focus on the transition\nfrom grid-connected to islanded mode, without investigating\nthe reverse transition to the main grid connection [9]–[11],\nwhich is the aim of this article.\nIn microgrids, the communication infrastructure technology\nis often utilized, making the measurement of voltage angle and\nmagnitude available for any converter in the grid. The avail-\nability of such measurements facilitates the synchronization\nprocess, which can be integrated in the secondary control of\nhierarchical control structures [7], [13], [15], [16], [25]. In [14]\nthe mains voltage is measured and communicated to the syn-\nchronizing converter, that uses a Phase-Locked-Loop (PLL) to\nobtain the magnitude and angle. The need for PLL is overcome\nin [12] with the introduction of an integrated synchronization\nand control technique, which still requires the mains voltage\nmeasurements through a low-bandwidth communication link.\nThe same occurs in [19], where the required signals are trans-\nmitted to the centralized control system and then sent back\nto the switch and to the inverters primary controls. In [17] a\nﬁber cable is installed between the switch and the converter\nacting as a master for the microgrid, while in [18] an Ethernet\nnetwork ensures a fast communication.\nSynchronization strategies without the need for a commu-\nnication link, still require the mains voltage measurement. For\ninstance, in [20] there is a unit in charge of the resynchroniza-\ntion, which is placed close to the switch. Thus, the voltage\nmeasurement is taken as reference. Reference [21] presents\nan indirect current control algorithm for seamless transition\nof three-phase inverters. The idea is to regulate the grid-side\ninductor current by controlling the magnitude and phase angle\nof the voltage across the ﬁlter capacitor. The adopted circuit\ninvolves a critical load placed in proximity to the inverter, and\nimmediately after there is the switch for the grid connection. In\nthis approach, the grid reconnection procedure is facilitated by\nthe availability of the grid voltage measurement. The authors\nin [22] present and compare different techniques to match the\ngrid and the inverter angle, but all of them require the grid volt-\nage measurement. In [23] the pre-synchronization is used to\nsynchronize the voltage and frequency of the microgrid and the\nmain grid using PLL technique. It is implemented in the mas-\nter inverter, which is placed close to the reconnection switch\nso as the grid voltage measurements are easily available. The\nconcept of PLL-less operation of grid-connected converters\nhas been recovered in [24]. Here, the authors introduce the\ninducverters, that are so called for their dynamics similar to\nthe induction machines with soft-synchronization capabilities;\nas disadvantage, they are conceived only as grid-following\nconverters. A method for seamless transition of three-phase\ninverters is proposed in [26], which allows them to respond\nvery quickly if the grid and the PCC voltages are out of phase.\nThe inverter current is greater than 2 pu for 1/38 of a cycle.\nAfter this overcurrent, the inverter enters in coast mode, i.e.,\nit turns off all the IGBTs for half a cycle. This would repre-\nsent an issue for the ST that, as mentioned in the introduction,\nfeeds the whole LV grid loads.\nAs per the state of the art, the situation discussed in this\narticle has never been found in literature. Either the prox-\nimity to the switch or the communication link make the\nvoltage measurement in some way available for the converter\nin charge of the synchronization process. Table I summarizes\nthe main points for several of the most signiﬁcant works on\nthe synchronization. The classiﬁcation has been performed by\ndividing these works by their grid-forming characteristics, and\nby two factors that facilitates the synchronization with the\nmain grid, i.e., the presence or less of fast Information and\nCommunication Technology (ICT) and the generic placement\nof the NOP in the grid.\nGIACOMUZZI et al.: SYNCHRONIZATION OF LOW VOLTAGE GRIDS FED BY SMART AND CONVENTIONAL TRANSFORMERS 2943\nTABLE I\nSTATE OF THE ART OF SEAMLESS TRANSITION\nB. The Smart Transformer Concept\nThe ST is a solid-state transformer, interfacing MV and\nLV distribution grids, able to provide services to the distribu-\ntion grids. Although different architectures are possible [27],\nthe three-stage conﬁguration can provide more functionali-\nties compared to other designs, as for example the LV Direct\nCurrent (DC) and MV DC connections for renewables and\nelectric vehicle integration. In a three-stage design, the ST MV\nconverter regulates the MV DC-link voltage through active\npower absorption from MV grid and controls the reactive\npower injection [28]. The DC/DC converter, in addition to pro-\nviding galvanic isolation with a high frequency transformer,\nregulates the power ﬂow between MV and LV DC-links\nby controlling the LV DC-link voltage. Regarding the LV\nconverter, two working modes are possible (Fig. 2(a)): i) grid-\nforming mode, that synthesizes the grid voltage waveform,\nwith the current that is determined by the load demand; ii)\ngrid-following mode, that follows the grid voltage, to regulate\nthe active and reactive current injection in the LV grid.\nThis work focuses on the transient period during the syn-\nchronization procedure, when the ST LV converter remains in\ngrid-forming mode (see top half of Fig. 2(b)), before switch-\ning to the power control in grid-following mode. Two signals\nare delivered by the NOP to ST: the ﬁrst, denoted as NOP\nclosure signal, states the NOP closure request and, therefore,\nto start the closing procedure. The second, indicated as NOP\neffective closure signal, determines that NOP has been effec-\ntively closed; only after receiving this signal, ST shifts to the\ngrid-following mode, as shown in blue boxes in Fig. 2(b).\nHowever, the communication signals can reach the ST after\ntens of seconds, if not minutes, after the NOP closure, due to\nthe slow bandwidth of the current communication infrastruc-\nture. For this reason, i) after sending out the closure signal,\nthe NOP has to wait for a sufﬁcient time that the signal is\nreceived by the ST, before effectively starting the closure pro-\ncedure; ii) the ST control needs to detect the effective NOP\nclosure only from its output measurements.\nWhen it receives the NOP closure signal, the ST remains\nin grid-forming mode. An external control loop is activated\nto control the power injection in the LV grid, varying the\nvoltage magnitude. This feature ensures that the active power\ninjected by ST remains constant during the operation. During\nFig. 2.

It\nhas been assumed that large power variations are not present\n2944 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID, VOL. 12, NO. 4, JULY 2021\nTABLE II\nBASE VALUES AND LOAD POWER OF THE CASE STUDY\nTABLE III\nLINE IMPEDANCE OF THE CASE STUDY\nduring this time window (few minutes at most), and, if they\noccur, the voltage controller is able to address them (see study\ncase in Section V-B). The lower part of Fig. 2(b) shows a qual-\nitative behavior of the ST LV converter, when it switches from\nthe voltage control in grid-forming mode to the power control\nvarying actively the voltage. It is worth noting that the controls\nare enabled by low bandwidth signals delivered by the NOP,\nand no fast communication is implemented in this application.\nIII. A\nNALYSIS OF POWER TRANSFER\nIN MESHED OPERATIONS\nThis section aims to analyze the power ﬂow during the syn-\nchronization of the ST with the transformer-fed grid under dif-\nferent voltage magnitude and angle. The analysis is performed\nconsidering a typical U.K. two feeder radial distribution grid,\nshown in Fig. 1. It is assumed that the ST and the conventional\ntransformer are fed by the same MV grid and they both oper-\nate as grid-forming for the LV-fed grids. The adopted base\nvalues are pointed out in Table II, together with the loads\nactive power: the nominal voltage in LV European lines has\nbeen selected as base voltage, whilst the base power is the\nrated power of ST. The power factor is set at 0 .95 for all the\nloads. The Distributed Generation (DG) unit is controlled to\ninject only active power (denoted with negative sign). Table III\nexpresses the pu line impedances.\nAs well known in literature, the line resistance in trans-\nmission line is commonly neglected. However, if LV lines are\nconsidered, both resistive and inductive components need to be\nboth taken into account, since the X/R ratio is lower than unity.\nFollowing this assumption, the pu complex power delivered by\nST can be calculated as:\nP\nST + jQST = VST∠θST\n(\nIST∠θI,ST\n)∗ =\n= VST∠θST\n( VST∠θST − VCT∠θCT\nReq + jXeq\n) ∗\n(1)\nwhere PST and QST are ST output active and reactive power,\nrespectively, VST, IST, VCT, θST, θI,ST and θCT are the ST\noutput voltage and current rms values, the conventional trans-\nformer output rms voltage, the ST voltage and current angle\nFig. 3. Apparent power delivered by ST expressed in p.u. as a function of\nconventional transformer voltage and angle.\nand the conventional transformer voltage angle, respectively;\nReq and Xeq are the equivalent resistance and reactance\nbetween the ST and the transformer, respectively, if the NOP\nis closed; the superscript\n∗ denotes complex conjugate quan-\ntity. After some manipulations of (1) and splitting real and\nimaginary part, the active and reactive power delivered by ST\ncan be represented by (2) and (3), respectively:\nP\nST = VST\nZ2eq\n[\nReq(VST − VCT cos θCT) − VCTXeq sin θCT\n]\n(2)\nQST = VST\nZ2eq\n[\nXeq(VST − VCT cos θCT) + VCTReq sin θCT\n]\n(3)\nThe phase angle θST is chosen as reference and set at 0 ◦.\nIn Fig. 3 the ST apparent power is plotted as a function of\nvCT magnitude and phase. The ﬁgure has been obtained by\nadopting the superposition principle, short-circuiting before\nthe ST and subsequently the conventional transformer and then\nsumming output current of the ST in the two situations. The\nST has been considered working with voltage magnitude V\nST\nand phase θST at 1 .025 pu and 0 ◦, respectively. As already\nexpressed in (2) and (3), since Req is higher than Xeq,t h e\nvoltage magnitude affects mainly the active power, while the\nreactive power depends on the phase angle difference. During\nsynchronization, it is important to avoid the conditions that\nlead to the ST overload. As can be noted in Fig. 3, the worst\nsituation for the ST is during undervoltage conditions of the\ntransformer-fed LV grid. Indeed, after the NOP closure, the\nST overloads. Under these conditions, the transformer phase\nangle does not inﬂuence appreciably the ST power, due to the\nsmaller contribution from reactive power in comparison of the\nactive power. As an example, if we consider V\nCT = 0.95 pu\nand θCT = 2◦, the steady-state ST active power becomes\n0.97 pu and reactive power 0 .37 pu. As a consequence, the\napparent power delivered by ST is 1 .04 pu, with a resul-\ntant overload. It can be concluded that the voltage difference\nbetween the ST and the conventional transformer has to be\nstrictly controlled in order to avoid the ST overload.\nGIACOMUZZI et al.: SYNCHRONIZATION OF LOW VOLTAGE GRIDS FED BY SMART AND CONVENTIONAL TRANSFORMERS 2945\nFig. 4. Timeline of the NOP closure procedure.\nIV . CONTROL STRATEGY OF THE ST\nThis section proposes a synchronization strategy to con-\ntrol the power ﬂow of STs in case of slow commu-\nnication infrastructure. The following assumptions have\nbeen made:\na) Only low bandwidth industrial communication is estab-\nlished between the NOP and ST (e.g., SCADA); signals\ntransfer may range in tens of seconds, if not minutes.\nb) The NOP can close within a certain phase difference\n/Delta1θNOP (i.e., ±2◦) at its extremities, and it is rated\nlarge enough to withstand the in-rush current during its\nclosure.\nc) The ST LV converter works in grid-forming mode with\nmagnitude higher than the conventional transformer (i.e.,\nVST = 1.025 pu) and phase θST = 0◦ prior to the NOP\nclosure signal.\nAn uncoordinated synchronization between the two LV\nfeeders can cause large current inﬂow, created by the differ-\nence in voltage amplitude and phase between the two voltage\nsources (i.e., ST and conventional transformer). In order to\nlimit this current, and therefore the exchange of active and\nreactive power between the two voltage sources, the difference\nin frequency, phase angle and magnitude of the voltage at NOP\nextremities should be minimized. Concerning the frequency,\nthis work considers the case where the ST and transformer\nfeeders are connected to the same MV grid, sharing the same\nfrequency. It has been assumed in this work that the ST works\nat nominal frequency (i.e., 50 Hz). As a consequence, only\nphase angle and magnitude differences of the voltage still need\nto be addressed.\nThe timeline of the proposed safe NOP switching strategy\nfor ST is shown in Fig. 4. Once the distributor system operator\nestablishes the NOP closure, the NOP sends a signal to ST (it\nmay require several minutes due to the slow communication),\ncommunicating the closure request. Then, the NOP switching\nstrategy is composed of three stages:\n(i) ST controls the active power varying the output voltage\nmagnitude;\n(ii) ST varies its output voltage angle, to match the trans-\nformer angle;\n(iii) ST detects the NOP closure measuring its output reactive\npower.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, stages (i) and (ii) contribute to generate\nthe voltage reference for ST, while stage (iii) is important to\ndetect the NOP closure and halt the progress of stage (ii).\nAfter receiving the effective closure signal from the NOP, the\nST ﬁnally can shift to the grid-following mode, synchronizing\nto the voltage imposed by the conventional transformer.\nFig. 5. Control scheme of ST LV converter.\nA. ST Active Power Control\nThe small phase difference at the NOP terminals (condition\nb)), that guarantees the switch closure, allows us to neglect\nthe voltage phase impact and consider only the effect of VCT\non PST and QST variation. As demonstrated in Section III, the\nvoltage difference affects the ST active power more than the\nreactive one; for this reason, in this strategy the generation\nof the voltage reference amplitude involves the active power.\nWhen ST receives the NOP closure signal, it stores the active\npower measured at its own output, denoted as P\nST,0, in order\nto preserve the initial power ﬂow after the synchronization. A\nclosed-loop control is implemented with a proportional inte-\ngral controller, tracking the ST active power at the value P\nST,0\nby controlling the output voltage. The output of the controller\nis the voltage /Delta1VST that is added to nominal voltage set-point\nVST,N to obtain the new voltage reference V∗\nST.\nB. ST Angle Voltage Variation Method\nAs shown in Fig. 3, a difference of few degrees in the phase\nbetween the two voltage sources leads to a ST power injection\nincrease up to 5 %. In order to meet the closure requirements\nstated in assumption b), the voltage angle of the ST has to be\nchanged, to reduce the difference with the conventional trans-\nformer one. Thanks to the decoupling effect of ST with the MV\ngrid, when NOP is open, the ST output power is not affected\nby variations of the angle. This feature allows to vary dynam-\nically the ST voltage angle, as an example adopted in this\nwork, with a ramp function with a slope coefﬁcient of 2 .5\n◦/s.\nThe phase variation is limited in this work in the range of\n(−10\n◦ ÷+10◦), considered as worst case for phase difference\nbetween the two feeders. It is worth to note that is possible to\n2946 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID, VOL. 12, NO. 4, JULY 2021\nFig. 6. Time response of NOP closure detection strategy for different time\nconstants τLPF of the lowpass ﬁlter and parameters ϵ.\nextend the range in order to include even larger phase differ-\nences, although they are not common; hence, this limitation\ndoes not affect the validity of the strategy. In this application,\nthe angle control begins from 0\n◦ with a negative slope. Once\nreached the saturation value of −10◦, it subsequently increases\nuntil 10◦, as depicted in the ST phase variation block of Fig. 5.\nThe process requires 12 .2 s in the worst hypothesis where the\nphase difference is around +10◦. If the requirements to close\nNOP are not met (e.g., higher phase difference), the ST phase\nangle is brought back at 0\n◦.\nC. NOP Closure Detection\nAmong the assumptions listed at the beginning of the sec-\ntion, the low bandwidth communication between NOP and\nST is the one that mostly affects the detection of NOP clo-\nsure. Therefore, ST has to recognize the NOP closure and stop\nthe phase variation, relying only on its own measured quan-\ntities. If not halted, the phase variation continues to change\nthe ST reactive power injection. Since an active power loop\nis implemented to avoid increase in P\nST, the closure detec-\ntion cannot be based on active power variation. Starting from\nthis premise, the detection is based only on ST reactive power\nmeasurements. To stop the phase change, the strategy shown\nin the lower part of Fig. 5 is implemented. At ﬁrst, the reactive\npower is ﬁltered by a lowpass ﬁlter with time constant τ\nLPF,\nobtaining QST,LPF, to ﬁlter any stochastic power variation.\nQST,LPF = QST\n1\n1 + sτLPF\n(4)\nThe ST detects the NOP closure through the difference\nbetween QST,LPF and the value of reactive power QST,0, that\nhas been stored once received the closure signal: if this is\nlarger than a certain threshold ϵ, as shown in (5), the ST rec-\nognizes the NOP closure and halts the phase variation; if not,\nthe ST voltage phase variation continues.\n⏐⏐QST,0 − QST,LPF\n⏐⏐ >ϵ (5)\nThe selection of the parameters τLPF and ϵ deﬁned in (4)\nand (5) impacts both on the time response and the robustness\nof the NOP closure detection. Fig. 6 shows the reactive power\ndifference |Q\nST,0 − QST,LPF| as a function of the time for a\nTABLE IV\nPARAMETERS ADOPTED IN THE TEST CASES\nreactive step equal to 0 .07 pu, plotted for different parame-\nters τLPF and ϵ. The algorithm detecs the NOP closure, if the\nsolid line representing |QST,0 −QST,LPF| crosses the horizontal\ndashed line representing ϵ. As an example, for ϵ = 0.05 p.u., a\nslow ﬁlter (e.g., τLPF = 0.2 s) leads to detect the NOP closure\nafter 250 ms, a long time for a safe switch. The choice of a\nfaster ﬁlter (e.g., τLPF = 0.1 s) reduces the detection time to\nabout 100 ms, but it may introduce some noise in the power\nmeasurement. At the same time, a lower detection threshold ϵ\ncan compensate this problem (e.g., ϵ = 0.02 p.u.), but it may\nconfuse fast reactive power changes in the grid (e.g., capacitor\ninsertion) with the NOP closure.\nTo achieve a compromise between detection speed, noise\nrejection and false detection, in this work the two following\nvalues have been adopted:\nτLPF = 0.05 s ϵ = 0.02 pu. (6)\nV. S IMULATION RESULTS\nThe validity of the proposed synchronization strategy has\nbeen veriﬁed through simulation in PLECS/MATLAB envi-\nronment. Three test cases have been considered:\nA) conventional transformer-fed LV grid undervoltage;\nB) renewable power variation during closure procedure;\nC) synchronization in ideal conditions (zero voltage mag-\nnitude and phase difference).\nAs mentioned, the distribution system operator can request\nthe NOP closure, to support the transformer-fed grid during\nunder-voltage conditions. In the simulation, the ST receives\nthe NOP closure request signal around 3 .9 s (see Fig. 7(a)),\nstarting the closure control strategy. Table IV resumes the dif-\nferent values concerning the three cases presented; V\nST and\nθST are omitted because are always equal to VST,N and θST,N,\nrespectively.\nA. Conventional Transformer-Fed Grid Undervoltage\nIn the ﬁrst test case, the transformer-fed grid voltage is\nVCT = 0.95 pu and θCT is equal to 5 ◦ as initial condition.\nNote that without the ST phase control, the NOP could not\nclose due to a phase difference at its extremities, that is higher\nthe allowed value ( ±2\n◦). The ST voltage phase and NOP\nphase difference at NOP extremities during the phase variation\nare depicted in Fig. 7(a). If only the voltage phase variation\nmethod is implemented, the NOP is able to close, but the dif-\nference in voltage magnitude induces an active power ﬂow\nfrom the source with higher voltage to the lower one, i.e.,\nfrom the ST to the conventional transformer. The change in\nactive and reactive power in this case are plotted in the top\nhalf of Fig. 7(b). The simulation results conﬁrm the outcomes\nGIACOMUZZI et al.: SYNCHRONIZATION OF LOW VOLTAGE GRIDS FED BY SMART AND CONVENTIONAL TRANSFORMERS 2947\nFig. 7. (a) ST voltage phase angle and voltage phase difference at NOP\nextremities, respectively in blue and red line; (b) ST apparent, active and\nreactive power, and voltage respectively in blue, red, green, and black lines,\nin case of NOP closure for CT-fed LV grid undervoltage without and with\npower control.\nof Fig. 3: ST active power rises to 0 .97 pu, while the reactive\npower rises from 0 .27 pu to 0 .37 pu; together they overload\nST, with the apparent power reaching 1 .04 pu.\nEnabling the proposed synchronization strategy, the active\npower is kept ﬁxed at the value that ST was delivering before\nthe NOP closure signal, as shown by red line in the sec-\nond subplot of Fig. 7(b), after a short overshoot transient (ca.\n60 ms). The ST power control loop adjusts the voltage mag-\nnitude (black line in Fig. 7(b)), reducing it from 1 .025 pu\nto 0.983 pu. Despite the lower voltage quality, this reduction\nis temporary and it lasts only until receiving the NOP effec-\ntive closure signal (i.e., few minutes). It is worth to note that\nthe power variation, which corresponds to the NOP closure,\noccurs around 13 .35 s, i.e., almost 10 s after the NOP signal.\nThis is due to the 5\n◦ initial phase difference between the NOP\nterminals, that forces the phase variation algorithm to perform\nalmost all the ramp signal before meeting the closure require-\nment of −2◦ </Delta1 θNOP < 2◦. This condition has been chosen\nto examine a worst case scenario, where the whole angle ramp\nis needed to meet the NOP closure requirements. As can be\nseen from Fig. 8, when the NOP closes, the reactive power\nincreases, as illustrated from green line. The detection sensed\nby ST through (5) occurs 15 ms later.\nFig. 8. Magniﬁcation of ST phase voltage, in blue line, and reactive power,\nin green line, during NOP closure.\nFig. 9. ST reactive power (black line) and phase voltage for different τLPF.\nTo understand practically the impact of the ﬁlter time con-\nstant τLPF on the NOP closure detection, Fig. 9 shows the\nresponse of the NOP closure detection for different time con-\nstant τ\nLPF. As can be noted, a larger ﬁlter (e.g., τLPF = 0.2s )\nleads to a delayed detection, halting the angle with more than\n60 ms delay with respect to the chosen value of τLPF = 0.05 s.\nB. DG Power Reduction During Closure Procedure\nAn issue that can be encountered during the closure pro-\ncedure is a fast power change in the ST grid, due to a load\ndisconnection, or the fast power variation from the DG, such\nas photovoltaic plants. In test case B, the same initial condi-\ntions as test case A are represented, i.e., V\nCT = 0.95 pu and\nθCT = 5◦, while a sudden and unexpected power reduction\nof DG, corresponding to half of its delivering power, occurs\nimmediately after that the ST receives the NOP signal. The\nﬁrst related problem is that the active power loop is already\nenabled, thus the ST does not change its power output to\ncompensate the DG power reduction, but it keeps it at the\nvalue prior the NOP signal, as can be seen from black line of\nFig. 10. The robustness of the strategy is highlighted by the\nfact that the closure procedure is not interrupted because of\nthe loss of generation, since this affects mainly active power,\nwhile the NOP closure detection is sensed through reactive\npower.\nC. Synchronization in Ideal Conditions\nIn some cases, it may occur that the ST and the conven-\ntional transformer have the same voltage magnitude and angle\n2948 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID, VOL. 12, NO. 4, JULY 2021\nFig. 10. ST apparent, active and reactive power, and voltage respectively in\nblue, red, green, and black lines in case of NOP closure for undervoltage of\nconventional transformer-fed LV grid and DG power reduction during closure\nprocedure.\nFig. 11. ST apparent, active and reactive power, and voltage respectively in\nblue, red, green, and black lines, in case of NOP closure in ideal conditions.\n(i.e., VCT = 1.025 pu and θCT = 0◦). This case represents\nthe optimal condition for synchronization, because no power\nincrease or decrease is seen by the ST. Actually, the real ideal\ncase is when the voltage magnitude and angle match at the two\nsides of the NOP. Nevertheless, the angle variation within a\nlow voltage distribution grid is relatively small and sufﬁciently\nwithin the safety range of the NOP closure. For this reason, the\nsame voltage magnitude and angle of the two transformers can\nbe assumed as ideal conditions. In this situation the NOP clo-\nsure could be achieved with no strategy implemented in ST, but\nbecause of the low bandwidth communication between NOP\nand ST, the synchronization strategy has to be initialized in any\ncase. However, with respect to the previous cases, the closure\ndetection cannot sense the reactive power change induced by\nthe NOP closure, but only the one generated by phase varia-\ntion. For this reason the reactive power threshold for detecting\nthe NOP closure in (5) has to be carefully selected to recog-\nnize such condition. As can be seen in Fig. 11, the chosen\nvalue of 0 .02 pu is sufﬁcient to recognize the NOP closure in\naround 200 ms.\nD. Grid Parameter Variation Analysis\nThe proposed strategy has been ﬁnally validated through\nseveral simulations under different grid parameters, i.e., DG\ngeneration and conventional transformer voltage. The NOP\nclosure detection time has been measured and reported in\nTABLE V\nDETECTION TIME WITH PARAMETER VARIATION [ms]\nFig. 12. Power Hardware In the Loop experimental setup in the laboratory.\nTable V. It is worth to note that different load conditions do\nnot affect signiﬁcantly the time response of the strategy, which\nis very fast (less than 40 ms). Only the ideal conditions of the\ngrid (i.e., both ST and conventional transformer with the same\nvoltage angle) can really slow down the NOP closure detec-\ntion, it has been observed through test-case C. In this case\nthe detection can reach up to 380 ms, and thus decreases the\nmethod performance. However, it must be remembered that an\nideal condition does not imply any in-rush current ﬂow dur-\ning the NOP closure. Thus, the impact on the ST and local\nloads is minimal, and a longer detection does not represent an\nimportant issue.\nVI. E\nXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION BY MEANS OF PHIL\nThe experimental veriﬁcation of the ST synchronization\nstrategy has been performed with the PHIL system shown\nin Fig. 12. The hardware under test is the LV converter of\nthe ST, the RTDS is the employed digital real time simulator,\nand the power ampliﬁer is a Spitzenberger 3-phase PAS 15000\nlinear power ampliﬁer. The PHIL evaluation is performed by\nmeans of a modiﬁed current-type ideal transformer method,\nthat has been described in [29], and for this reason not repeated\nin this work. To validate the performance of the switching\nstrategy, a sample LV network is simulated in RTDS, as in\nFig. 13. Between the ST hardware and the simulated grid,\na current scale factor of 150 pu is introduced to address the\ndifferent power scale between the simulated ST LV converter\nGIACOMUZZI et al.: SYNCHRONIZATION OF LOW VOLTAGE GRIDS FED BY SMART AND CONVENTIONAL TRANSFORMERS 2949\nFig. 13.

Phase voltage difference at NOP terminals.\nand the hardware one. As a consequence, 1 kW in hardware\ncorresponds to 150 kW in the simulator.\nA. Experimental Results\nThe test case A simulated in PLECS/MATLAB software\nhas been reproduced with PHIL evaluation to validate the\nproposed control strategy. Both the situations without and with\npower control have been tested. Fig. 14 illustrates the voltage\nphase difference at NOP extremities. When the angle differ-\nence between the ST and the transformer grids is within ±2\n◦,\nthe NOP closes and thus the voltage phase difference rapidly\nbecomes 0\n◦.\nThe outcomes depicted in Fig. 15 show a correspondence\nbetween simulation and experimental results. The ﬁrst plot\nhighlights that without power control the apparent power\nwould settle at 1 .04 pu, that reﬂects what shown in the sim-\nulations and expected in the theory. If the power control is\nactivated, the power surge is limited to few cycles, and the\npower is restored to the previous value. With respect to the\nsimulations, the power controller shows an oscillating behav-\nior with a frequency of 100 Hz, due to small unbalance in\nthe current measurements in the RTDS. Nevertheless, no ﬁl-\nter has been added at the output to avoid the slowing down\nof the dynamics. A better understanding of this transient can\nbe achieved from its magniﬁcation during the NOP closure in\nFig. 16. The zoom shows how the power control limits the\nST overload to three cycles (i.e., 60 ms in 50 Hz systems) that\nFig. 15. ST output active (red line), reactive (green line) and apparent power\n(blue line) without and with active power control, respectively, and ST output\nvoltage with active power control.\nFig. 16. Magniﬁcation of ST apparent power during NOP closure: with and\nwithout active power control, respectively in blue and red line.\ndemonstrates that the proposed control is able to restore the\nST apparent power below 1 pu dynamically.\nVII. C ONCLUSION\nIn this article a synchronization strategy for ST meshed\noperations with a conventional transformer-fed grid is\nproposed, able to manage the power ﬂow in-rush during\nthe NOP switch closure. The introduced control strategy\novercomes the physical distance and the lack of fast communi-\ncation in the grid, relying only on the ST local measurements.\nThe ST, working in voltage-forming mode during the synchro-\nnization, can adapt its voltage angle, within a certain range\n[−10\n◦ ÷ 10◦], to match the transformer-fed grid angle, and,\nthus, to close the NOP. The proposed synchronization pro-\ncedure has proved to handle the active power in-rush from\nthe ST, caused by possible difference in the two grid volt-\nages. Employing an active power control, the ST can vary its\nvoltage set-point, ﬁxing its power injection to the value prior\nthe NOP closure request. The impact of the proposed strat-\negy on the ST-fed grid has been evaluated analytically and\n2950 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID, VOL. 12, NO. 4, JULY 2021\nthrough simulation, and validated experimentally by means\nof Power-Hardware-In-Loop system.
