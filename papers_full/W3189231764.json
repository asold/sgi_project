INTRODUCTION \nPower transformers play a vital role in electrical power distribution to end users from power \nutilities. The transformer ensures that power is transmitted efficiently. Adequate cooling is necessary since \nthere is significant heating up of the transformer core due to increased load and transie nt faults [1], hence the \nneed to develop effective transformer dielectric insulators. Mineral oil has been the most commonly used \ndielectric due to its good electrical insulation and cooling characteristics  [2]. However, concerns on the non -\nbiodegradability of mineral oil [3] have influenced exploration of natural esters over the years [4]. Mineral \noils are further considered not environmentally friendly because they have low flash point and fire point \nwhich poses a risk of fire under surge and transient fault conditions. \nTransformer dielectrics also provide electrical insulation between the core and the transformer \ncasing even under fault conditions such as winding insulation failure. Most transformer fails are traceable to \ninsulation failure [5]. The dielectric insulator may also fail as its insulation degrades with time (ageing) [6], \nhence the need to characterize the transformer oil degradation properties. To mitigate risks posed by mineral \noils, natural esters are investigated to develop effe ctive insulators that comply with regulatory standards of \nAmerican standard testing and material (ASTM) and international electrotechnical commission (IEC). When \nconsidering pure esters, studies have shown that they have high viscosity [7] and their high cost of production \nhave motivated a change of direction towards blending mineral oil and ester oil together, and further looking \ninto mixing with nano particles to make superior nanofluids  [8]. Methods used to test pure fluids can deduce \ntheir behavioural characteristics from their structures and composition. However, these cannot universally be \nused in testing mixed dielectrics because unlike their pure counterparts, mixed dielectrics could have \ndifferent oxidation patterns. It is therefore imperative t o find possible properties of esters blended with \nmineral oils. Different experimental and simulation methodologies have been used to analyse their properties. \nThese include, but not limited to, ramp application, Locke method, DGA and gas chromatography, \nGaussian’s probability statistics analysis, Poison’s statistical equation, Duval’s triangle methods, partial \ndischarge, Fourier transform analysis, broadband dielectric spectroscopy, and molecular simulation \ntechnology analysis. These methods are reviewed i n detail in the other sections of this paper in their \nrespective applications. It is therefore important to improve methods of analysing and diagnosing insulator \nproperties before, during and after use for each proposed insulator to avoid catastrophic fail ure of the \ntransformer [9]. \nThis paper elaborates on the evolution of transformer liquid dielectric insulation as modern testing \napproaches are applied to them by different scholars. Furthermore, the review shows the limitations and \nimprovements to metho dologies used. There is small, consolidated literature on methods applied in mixed \ntransformer dielectrics hence the study informs on key focal properties of dielectrics being physical, \nchemical, electrical, aging, and dissolved gas analysis based on previ ous scholarly research. These properties \nare expository reviewed as breakdown voltage (BDV), flash and fire point, viscosity, oxidation stability, \nDGA, moisture content analysis and biodegradability. It further enlightens on alternative blending of natural  \nand mineral oil dielectrics and other miscible liquids/fluids through the application of nanoparticles in \nconcerted efforts to find a suitable replacement for pure mineral oil. Consolidated findings are intended to \nrecommend and guide present research and  industrial production and safe utilization of more reliable mixed \ntransformer dielectrics. \n \n \n2. EVOLUTION \nTransformer liquid dielectrics have been categorised into mineral oil, synthetic oil, ester oil, mixed \nand nanofluid oils as in Figure 1. The evolution of these dielectrics began with the use of mineral oil. This oil \nis harnessed from non -renewable natural resources; hence it is nonbiodegradable. Furthermore, the low flash \nand fire point of mineral oil necessitated the development of synthetic oils. To im prove biodegradability of \npower transformer dielectrics, ester -based dielectrics were considered for investigation as potential \ncandidates. Their potential in both pure form and when mixed with mineral oil are vital for the industry. \nNanofluids have also been introduced to improve the dielectric stability of mineral and ester -based dielectrics \nwhich will be further discussed in the paper. \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci  ISSN: 2502-4752  \n \nAlternative liquid dielectrics in power transformer insulation: a review (Bokang Agripa Tlhabologo) \n1763 \n \n \nFigure 1. Categories of transformer liquid dielectrics \n \n \nNatural ester oils refer to the oils extracted from cold pressing of seeds and plants  [10]. The \ncommonly used natural esters are soybean oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, rice bran oil, coconut oil, corn oil, \ncotton seed oil, olive oil, palm nuts oil, canola oil , and pongamia pinnata o il [11], [12]. Their use in power \ntransformers is mainly due to their electrical and chemical stability because they are made up of both \nsaturated and unsaturated fatty acids. When an ester triglyceride is formed, alcohol glycerol forms covalent \nbonds with three fatty acid molecules, releasing water molecules in condensation during esterification \nreaction as shown in (1). This makes them less prone to oxidation. Figure 2 shows the formed fatty acid ester \ntriglycerides with single unsaturated fatty acids which gives them advantage to be used in power transformers \nas the bonds of unsaturated fatty acids make the dielectric more susceptible to oxidation  [13]. \n \n𝑅‑𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐻 +𝐻𝑂−𝑅 ⇌ 𝑅‑𝐶𝑂𝑂𝑅′ +𝐻2𝑂 [14] (1) \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Fatty acid ester triglycerides with single unsaturated fatty acids [13] \n \n \n2.1.   Dielectric capabilities of alternative dielectrics \nEster based dielectrics have been highly comparable to mineral oil  [15]. In 1990, Diana and Watson \n[16] used the ramp application technique and the experimental analysis produced comparable characteristics \nof ester as to mineral oil. This is in the sense that ester oil used was found to have Ohmic transport behaviour \nin the pre -breakdown test. This is to sa y there is a linear relationship of current and voltage induced during \nthe experiment when plotted on a log -log plot. The decade 1990 to 2000 brought more research to probe the \nusefulness of esters in transformer insulation. Conseil international des grand s reseaux electriques (CIGRE) \nworking group  [17] gave a detailed performance analysis of ester -based dielectrics. CIGRE work group \nfound that the water solubility in natural esters is significantly higher than in mineral oil, which is a \ncontributing factor to good dielectric strength in mineral oil. When further investigating viscosity of esters, \nthey are found to be much more viscous than mineral oil which poses a risk of developing hotspots in the \ntransformer tank. Another crucial property emphasised by  [17] is the absence of corrosive sulphur in ester oil \nwhich greatly reduces the tendency to cause corrosion by sulphur reacting with the windings of the \ntransformer. This is a common phenomenon with mineral oils as they contain corrosive sulphur.  \n \n2.2.   Ageing, solubility, and lifetime of dielectrics \nMcShane et al. in [18] used Lockie method for aging tests beyond 500% expected life to perform \naccelerated life tests in which he concluded that using esters for transformer dielectrics will ultimately \nincrease lifetime of the solid insulator, hence an increase of transformer life span. McShane et al. [19] further \n\n                ISSN: 2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2021: 1761 - 1777 \n1764 \nemphasises that the rate of aging of craft paper is associated to the liquid dielectric that it is immersed in. \nThis shows that with mineral oil, the ageing rate is quite faster than that of natural esters. The finding concurs \nwith [17]. This fast ageing can therefore be factored by corrosive sulphur presence and low water solubility \ncausing acid formation in mineral oil . Smith [20] has shown that natural ester oil can be used to replace \nmineral oil in transformers of at least 450 kV. However, to maintain the rated temperature rise, the \ntransformer cooling requirements should be modified to accommodate the physical property of natural esters  \nas they are much more viscous than mineral oil. Having less viscous dielectric allows ease circulation of the \noil, hence promoting cooling. This principle is further elaborated in this paper at viscosity subsection. \nDarwin et al. [21] elaborated on the solubility property of esters which helps absorb any moisture \ncontent that may develop on the insulation paper in the core. However, the study on the other hand shows \nthat when using esters alone, the cost is three to eight times the cos t of using mineral oil. It is therefore \nimportant to reduce cost by having a mixed dielectric of both natural ester and mineral oil. Fofana et al. [22] \ncompared thermal and electrical stresses of mineral and ester oils against their aging performance. In  this the \nuse of esters is recommended based on the superiority of their physical and chemical properties that promote \nslower degradation when ageing. Esters tend to age slower and have better moisture absorption than mineral \noil which prolongs the lifetime of insulating paper. \n \n2.3.   Mixing ratios of dielectrics \nIEEE [23] also released maintenance and acceptance standards to be used in regulating and \nstandardising the use of esters as transformer dielectrics. It is with these standards that Ulrych et al . [24] \nsuggests the use of mixed dielectrics made from ester and mineral oil with inhibitors for safer transformer \ninsulation technology. Fofana et al . [25] investigated high voltage transformer mixed dielectric insulator \nproperties. The dielectrics ar e a mixture of ester and mineral oil in different proportions. Like non -mixed \ndielectrics, the physical, chemical and electrical properties were tested. They concluded that gassing \ntendencies are reduced when adding ester to mineral oil under thermal stres s and the general mixture has \nsuperior properties compared to pure mineral oil alone. \nGupta and Das [26], Gaussian’s probability statistics method with normal and Weibull distribution is \napplied to study the breakdown voltage of the dielectrics. It shows  that silicon as a synthetic ester has the \nlowest BDV followed by mineral oil then natural ester oil get the highest BDV. It is then concluded that \nnatural esters are more suitable to use to mix with mineral oil to enhance its electrical properties based o n the \nasymmetric Weibull distribution of breakdown voltage. Furthermore, a mixture proportion of natural ester oil \nand mineral oil is made taking into consideration the cost of esters which is eight times the cost of mineral oil  \n[21]. Therefore, it is pr actical to use more mineral oil than ester in the mixing ratio. One limitation to the \nmethods of mixing the oils is that there was no standard mixing ratio in place to obtain a standard mixture. \nApart from their excellent electrical and chemical properties , [27] emphasises on mixing esters with mineral \noil because the density and kinematic viscosity of esters are well above the standard limit provided by IEC \nguide.  \nWhen further discussing alternative dielectrics to mineral oils,  Borsi and Gockenbach [28] \nconcludes that the miscibility property of esters has enabled mixing with mineral oil, making a superior \nmixture with high BDV which minimizes the chances of transformer malfunctions. When thermal stress is \napplied to esters and mineral oil at different  temperatures, the experimental analysis suggested a future scope \nof research on using inhibitors [29] with esters to extend oxidation stability and lower the dissipation factor \nwhen replacing mineral oils  [30]. Karthik et al. [31] also emphasises the use of mixed dielectrics since the \nnatural esters have shown highest BDV, flash and fire point when in an experiment that compares mineral, \nsynthetic and natural ester oils.  \nWhen comparing characteristics of alternative dielectrics to  mineral oil, Fernandez et al . [32] \nanalysed mixtures of mineral and ester oil at various proportions to find the optimal mixing ratio. Optimality \nis based on having high fire resistance performance at lower cost. This implies that esters used in the ble nd \nshould be volumetrically less than mineral oil for cost minimization yet improving the BDV, flash and fire \npoint of mineral oil. Vegetable oils that have proved to be well within the standard of IEC guide for \ntransformers include rapeseed, sunflower, canola oil and soybean [32].  \n \n \n3. PROPERTIES OF TRANSFORMER LIQUID DIELECTRICS \nMethods under review are those used in BDV, flash and fire point, viscosity, oxidation stability, \nDGA, moisture content analysis , and biodegradability of power transformer dielectrics. Table 1 gives a \nsummary of standard tests that are carried out for transformer dielectrics for safety and quality purposes. \nThese standards are further elaborated on in the paper as they are explored in different studies. \n \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci  ISSN: 2502-4752  \n \nAlternative liquid dielectrics in power transformer insulation: a review (Bokang Agripa Tlhabologo) \n1765 \nTable 1.

Breakdown voltage \nBreakdown voltage is the most significant parameter in transformer dielectric. Dielectric breakdown \nvoltage is defined as the ability of the dielectric to withstand dielectric stresses.  It is a measure of how much \nvoltage it takes to produce a spark between two electrodes that are sepa rated by some distance while \nimmersed in the oil. The dielectric breakdown voltage test traditionally used for service aged fluids is ASTM \nD877. This method is less sensitive compared to ASTM D1816 for small amounts of contamination hence \nASTM D1816 and IE C 60156, are the most favourable method  [33]. This is because ASTM D1816 and IEC \n60156 do not experience and even depend on substantial quasi -uniform voltage stress at the edges of parallel \nplates as ASTM D877 does because the former does not use flat pl ate electrodes. IEC 60156 standard from \nTable 1 dictates the experimental procedure. According to the standard procedure, the submerged electrodes \nare separated by 2.5 mm and voltage is applied to them at gradual increase of 2 kV/sec until a spark is \nvisualised across the electrodes.  It is most important that the oil is stirred with a magnetic stirrer to eliminate \nbubbles in it. This standard of testing further imposes minimum safety limit for BDV to be 30 kV for liquid \ndielectrics. When dielectric strength  degrades, it typically indicates that there is significant presence of \nmoisture and polar particle contamination from external sources and/or insulation aging.  \n \n3.1.1. Statistical analysis \nIn 2013 Jing et al . [38] performed a statistical analysis on bre akdown voltage of natural esters, \nsynthetic esters and mineral oil , and concluded that the dielectric behaviour of esters is superior to that of \nmineral oils. However, it is without reasonable doubt that synthetic esters have comparable characteristics \nsuch as BDV that compete well with natural esters. It is the high production cost of synthetic esters that \ndeters from using them. Jing et al.  [38] developed some mobility equations and uses Laplace to solve for \nelectric field distribution. Due to limitations of this Laplace equation -based method, it is recommended that \npoison equation be introduced to find the dielectric insulator’s accurate electri c field distribution values. \nAbdelmalik et al. [39] found out that natural ester impregnated paper had an average breakdown voltage 42% \nhigher than mineral oil impregnated paper. Also, the natural ester impregnated paper showed only 5% \nreduction in tensi le strength test after 28 days of aging whereas that in mineral oil showed 35% reduction in \ntensile strength. This shows that natural esters indeed preserve the aging of kraft paper in the transformer. \n \n3.1.2. Gaussian probability analysis \nPerrier et al. [40] applied Gaussian’s probabilities in analysis of breakdown voltage measured using \nIEC 60156 specifications with a gap distance of 2.5 mm. The study also considers kinematic viscosity in \ninvestigating heat transfer, finding that high viscosity reduces ability of oil to circulate to transfer heat hence \nposing a risk of heat spots. Therefore, viscosity of mineral oil which is significantly low is preferable than \nthat of esters. The methodologies further lead to a conclusion that for optimal mixing, synthe tic ester should \nbe at 20% to mineral oil used without degrading viscosity and electrostatic charging tendency of mineral oil. \nThis yields a slower deteriorative dielectric when aging for the transformer. However, [41] experimentally \nshows that increasin g the presence of ester in the mixture significantly enhance the dialectical strength. The \npalm oil ester required for optimal mixing is 50% which indicates that there is no standard optimal mixing \nratio. This ratio for optimality only considers performanc e characteristics being enhanced dielectric \nbreakdown and flash and fire point. Therefore, to obtain a dielectric with good performance characteristics, \nthe ratio should be dependent on the properties of the individual dielectrics added to the mixture.  \n \n3.2.   Flash and fire point \nFlash point is the minimum temperature at which when heated, the oil forms a combustible vapour. \nFire point then becomes the minimum temperature at which the vapour formed when the oil is heated \ncontinues to burn for a minimum of 5 seconds when ignited by an open flame. These properties are tested to \nsatisfy ASTM D93 using Pensky -Martens closed cup tester as indicated in Table 1. Edible esters are fire safe \nand recommended as coolants and insulators hence suitable to use over miner al oils  [42], [43]. This \nminimizes the risk of fire and explosion when the transformer heats up due to overload and faults.  Raof et al. \n                ISSN: 2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2021: 1761 - 1777 \n1766 \nin [44] emphasizes on having a mixture of mineral oil and ester oil with mineral oil being less than 20% to \nproduce a dielectric with better electrical and physical properties than typical mineral oil -based insulators. \nThis is in consideration of contributions of each parti cipant oil in improving dielectric performance of the \nblend. However, the 80/20 ratio of ester/mineral oil was selected without considering the production costs \ninvolved with ester oil which is remarkably high  [2] and other scholars who previously consid ered both cost \nand performance opted to rather have more mineral than ester in the various blends.  When blending \ntrimethylolpropane ester with mineral oil, a clear trend of increase in flash point and fire point with increase \nin ester percentage in the ble nded dielectric is observed  [44]. This effect is due to the high molecular weight \nof ester oil as compared to mineral oil. \n \n3.3.   Viscosity \nViscosity as a measure of resistance to flow in a liquid has its implications in the cooling rate of a \ntransformer. The oil should be able to circulate from region of high temperature to that of low temperature. \nHighly viscous oil will not efficiently flow  to transfer the heat from its area of high concentration. Bertrand \nand Lauzevis [14] in an  experiment observes that viscosity of oils decreases with rise in temperature and \nincreases with decrease in temperature. Decreasing viscosity when temperature ri ses helps in easing up oil \ncirculation hence promoting convectional heat transfer from the transformer coil, cooling , and reducing \nhotspot formation. The first factor affecting viscosity of dielectrics is molecular weight. The higher the \nmolecular weight o f a fluid the more its resistance to flow which is viscosity. When blending ester and \nmineral oil, the mechanical stirring causes vibration energy which then raptures the ester chain by carbon \nhomolytic cleavage hence producing smaller molecules than that of the parent ester [45]. This explains why a \nblend of mineral and ester oil reduces the esters’ viscosity and chances of producing hot spots in the \ninsulation which yields a superior mixed transformer dielectric. \nKweon et al. [46] used the optical fib re sensor to measure hot spots in the transformer filled with \nnatural ester and compared to mineral oil filled transformer. The life curve of the two is similar, however, it \nis notable that natural oil filled transformer always had higher hot spot temperat ures, owing it to higher \nviscosity of natural esters. Chemical modification methods can be applied to reduce viscosity of natural \nesters. Ghani et al. [12] uses esterification with alcohol via hydrolysis to achieve the same. Reacting 2 -ethyl-\n1-hexanol with high oleic rapeseed also reduced kinematic viscosity significantly  [14]. Raof et al. [47] also \nuses neopentyl glycol (NPG) in transesterification process of high oleic palm methyl ester and NPG alcohol \nand reduced kinematic viscosity to approximately 20 mm2/s. These show that for each ester it is paramount to \nidentify a suitable alcohol to use as a viscosity suppressant.  Wilhelm et al. [48] indicates that other major \nfactors of natural ester dielectrics aging are viscosity, acidity , and dissipation factor. It is noted that acidity \nvaries due to hydrolysis whereas the viscosity varies with respect to oxidation in the natural ester. Perrier et \nal. [49] and [50] used kinematic viscosity to study the heat transfer of mixed dielectric s. Also, while \ninvestigating viscosity, DGA, and ageing performance of vegetal oil compared to mineral oil,  [51] found that \nnatural esters have 42.86% more lifetime than mineral oil when used in distribution transformers.   \nWhen evaluating kinematic visco sity of ester oils at 40 °C,  [52] found that  viscosity remained \nconstant, which means that viscosity is not affected by moisture content. Rather it is increased significantly \nby oxygen which corroborates the findings of Wilhelm et al. [53]. With further investigation on viscosity of \nnatural esters, high viscosity has become the main reason that natural ester oils are not used alone in power \ntransformers considering overloading conditions  [54]. This evoked a further study by the same authors on \nvarying structural placement of cooling fans to transformers. When predicting the hotspots and winding \ntemperature in the transformer using Thermal -Hydraulic network model, three horizontal fans or five vertical \nfans provide 100% cooling/heat evacuation for natur al ester oil filled transformer hence a structural \nmodification to power transformers is recommended [55]. \n \n3.4.   Oxidation \nThe presence of oxygen and water in transformer oils causes the process of oxidative degradation of \noil. This is further influenced by presence of copper winding as copper acts as a catalyst to the process. Due \nto oxidation, the acid formed is corrosive to the insulating paper further shortening the lifetime of the \ntransformer. Since the process involves free radical reactio n, oxidation inhibitors such as 2,6 -ditertiary-\nbutylphenol and 2,6 -di-tertiary-butyl-paracresol are used to interrupt the process. To assess oxidation \nstability, which is oxidation resistance of the oil, ASTM D2440 as in Table 1  is used by determining the \namount of sludge or Iron-II-Sulphide/ferrous sulphur formed in the oil samples as they age. \nMineral oil is one of the contributing factors to corrosive sulphur that causes deterioration to both \nthe conductive core and other metal parts of the transformer  [56]. Furthermore, the dielectric strength of the \ninsulation dielectric also decreases due to the corrosive sulphur presence  [56]. Natural ester chemical \nstructure has no sulphur compounds compared to petroleum based mineral oil which makes ester filled  \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci  ISSN: 2502-4752  \n \nAlternative liquid dielectrics in power transformer insulation: a review (Bokang Agripa Tlhabologo) \n1767 \ntransformers more corrosive resistant. It is also concluded in [57] that ASTM 1275 methods DIN 51353 \nneeded improvements as they were less sensitive to indicate sulphur presence in the oils used, thus posing a \nprobability of false negatives of sulphur presence.  \nMcShane [58] used food -grade additives to develop an edible -oil-based dielectric to mitigate the \nlimitation of lower oxidation resistance found in esters than in mineral oils. However, susceptibility to \noxidation and high pour point have been a  great disadvantage of natural esters in application [49].  In this \nstudy, to overcome oxidation stability limitations, proper methods and oxidation inhibitors are used.  \n \n3.5.   Dissolved gas analysis  \nDue to thermal stresses, transformer insulation materia ls breakdown and deteriorate gradually and \nrelease gases. These gases can be analysed to determine the rate of deterioration of sampled oil and predict \npending or occurring f aults. Martin et al. [59] and Perrier et al. [60] explain that the temperature range for \ngenerating stray gasses in ester oil is 40°C to 50 °C. The most notable gasses in envirotemp FR3 ester oil are \nhydrogen, ethane and some carbon dioxide. The studies further recommend modifications to methods used \nfor D GA analysis. When sampling the oil for DGA, it is vital to take extra precaution that any air bubble \nshould be extracted to prevent air from contacting the oil as it would negatively impact the precision of the \nmeasurement. \nWhen electrical and thermal faul ts are induced to esters, the gasses generated are not necessarily \ndifferent from those generated by mineral oil [61]. However, it is the rate at which gasses are generated in \nesters that is slower than that of mineral oil. This is because esters are mor e stable for medium temperature \nrange thermal faults  [61]. Khan et al. [62] further elaborates on the use of HYDRAN® 201R method, that it \nhas the same response time for both ester and mineral oil. The comparison of results for DGA of oil samples \nfrom membrane port and HYDRAN® 201R readings match. Another way to detect fault gases is using \nBuchholz alarm which will still be effective when usi ng ester oil. This has been proven by the impressive \nresponse time and gas quantity produced by HYDRAN® 201R and envirotemp FR3, which maintains \nsensitivity in the transformer.  \nDGA and moisture content analysis for natural esters, synthetic esters and min eral oil, shows that \nnatural esters have better specific gravity , and specific heat compared to mineral oil hence why natural ester \nprovide better cooling capacity [63]. It is further observed that during thermal ageing, synthetic esters mainly \nyield ethylene, and it has less kraft paper degradation than mineral oil but more than ester oil. However, it is \nalso noted and emphasised that natural esters have relatively higher viscosity. Murdiya et al . [64] used \nstreamer comparison of mineral oil and vegeta ble oil. During the experiment, the DGA is used to explain \ngasses generated during streamer generation. Rao et al . [5] also used streamer breakdown theory and \nconcludes that the presence of cellulose promotes streamer initiation more in mineral oil -based dielectric than \nnatural ester -based dielectric. This greatly reduce BDV of mineral oil. DGA has been conducted on the \nevolution of fault gasses when the oil is exposed to thermal stress. It is concluded that fault gases produced in \nnatural ester-based insulator are of significantly small quantity compared to mineral oil which indicates that \nester oils are more stable hence their high fire resistance [65]. \n \n3.5.1. Gas chromatography \nWhen investigating effects of heating on transformer oils, [66] uses gas chromatograph HP 6890 \naided with automatic liquid sampler HP 7649. The findings of the experiment show that Hydrogen, Carbon \nDioxide, Propane, Nitrogen, and Butene are the only combustible gases present in treated Refined Ricinus \nOil (ester) with  a total of amount of 2.9 ppm. Having few combustible gasses and at low quantities for that \nmatter gives the dielectric its high flash and fire point. DGA is used to identify gas quantities to assess the \nrisk of oil burning. To interpret DGA, a more precis e method called total combustible gas is used . TCG \nresults show that methyl ester oils are very much compliant to IEEE guide that set the limit for condition 1 to \n720 ppm [67]. \n \n3.5.2. Duval’s triangle methods \nPerrier et al. [60] further employs Duval’ s triangle 1 method for low energy discharges in ester and \nmineral oils. Hydrogen and Acetylene gasses are discovered in the same ratios for standard grade Naphthenic \nmineral oil and Triester oil. For low thermal faults, natural ester oils generate mainly Hydrogen and Ethane \nwhich are more detectible by Duval’s triangle 4. For mineral oils, Duval’s triangle 6 is the most \nrecommended because it has been specifically introduced to interpret ester oil DGAs. Since esters have more \nstray gassing than mineral oil [68] this technique that is more sensitive to stray gases by Duval triangle 6 was \ndeveloped.  \nGomez et al. 2014 [52] also investigated DGA in esters. Overheating fa ult was simulated at 150 °C \nwhile flat-plate electrode method was used in generating discharges. After discharge, the oil samples were \n                ISSN: 2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2021: 1761 - 1777 \n1768 \ncollected for DGA, and Duval triangle method used to interpret the fault gasses in the sample. The results \nconcur with th ose of  [60] as more methane is produced in mineral oil than FR3 ester which is mostly \nassociated to faults or defects occurring at low temperature. As a result, recommending the use of natural \nester-based dielectrics and employing Duval triangle method b ecause it is more sensitive to the straying \ngasses that are generated in esters during faults and defects. Duval’s triangle as a graphical method is easy, \nmore sensitive much precise to detect fault gasses [69]. \n \n3.5.3. Partial discharge \nMuhamad et al. [70] carried out a comparative investigation on DGA and partial discharge (PD) for \nshell diala MX mineral oil and  envirotemp FR3 ester -based transformer dielectrics in transformer fault \ndiagnosis. The investigation considers three common transformer faults being low energy PD, overheating \nand high energy arching for both dielectrics with and without solid insulator and at  different moisture levels. \nPD is carried out using IEC 60270 standards by the phase -resolved analysis method. When using the \nchromatography to analyse fault gases generated, PD phase resolved patterns turned up to be similar for both \nmineral and ester die lectrics. As a result, it is concluded that the same standards used for mineral oil to \ninterpret PDs can be used for esters to distinguish fault types. Even though the pattern prints are similar, \nester-based oil produced less gases in volumetric quantity f or PD fault. It is also worth noting that the \npresence of solid insulator enhances generation of dissolved hydrocarbon gases in oil.  \nWhen investigating DGA in FR3 and camellia based natural ester dielectrics,  [71] and [72] \ndemonstrates that DGA method s based on relative fault gas ratios are more accurate over those based on \namount of generated gas. This is because when using relative fault ratio, the test specimen is sampled from \nbulk oil but not from the point where breakdown occurs. The 30 ml of oil sample is heated, and 5 L of oil is \nadded in DGA together with the 30 ml specimen. This gives room for ambiguity and less accuracy. Since \nnatural esters and mineral oil have different molecular structures, then when using traditional three -ratio \nmethod on ester oils, the less precise method may not give a full representation of all the gasses generated \nduring breakdown or fault occurrence. Therefore, traditional three -ratio method used in mineral oils are \nsubject to amendment for application on ester-based dielectrics.  \nWang et al. [73] studied the gasses generated in natural oil and found that the main gases generated \nin esters are Hydrogen and Acetylene . This concurs with the finding that conventional interpretation of PD \ndiagnosis is applicable to natural esters. Also, [74] used statistical analysis on PD patterns of ester -based \ndielectrics considering skewness, mean value of shape parameter (Beta) of  the Weibull function and the ratio \nbetween number of positive and negative PD. The results showed a lower PD activity in natural ester -based \ndielectrics in comparison to mineral oil. Esters are recommended for use in transformer oils while a further \nstudy on their viscosity is also emphasized. \n \n3.5.4. Needle plane method \nSubject to needle -plane electrode voltage of 28 kV, DGA of Canola -based dielectric with influence \nof creepage discharge shows a high generation of hydrogen and other gases compared to mine ral oil. Though \nthe IEC 60599 standards and Duval’s triangle have been able to identify creepage discharge pattern for \nCanola-based dielectric, the standards ought to be modified to clearly analyse the dissolved gases considering \ncreepage discharge [75]. In November 2014, IEEE [76] provided standards to be used for interpretation and \nanalysis of fault gases in ester-based dielectrics for transformers. \nAmalanathan et al . [77] performed turbidity , alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) \nimpulse and UV absorption spectrum tests on edible natural ester oil and thermally aged ester oil. The study \nconcludes that indeed conditions of the transformer insulation can be monitored in real time using \nfluorescence analysis. This method involves using a bea m of light focused on a filter onto a detector so as to \nidentify and measure the electrons in the molecule sample that will be excited by the beam and caused to \nlight. This helps identify the PD behaviour of the dielectric when subjected to thermal ageing.  \n \n3.6.   Moisture content \nPresence of moisture content in the dielectric compromises its dielectric strength. Since transformer \ntemperature fluctuates, when it cools down, moisture dissolved therein becomes free molecules which \ndegrades the fluid and cellulose-based paper and lowers insulation potential. The use of ester -based dielectric \nprolongs the lifespan of k raft paper significantly compared to using the convectional mineral oil  [78]. This is \nalso due to the ability of natural ester to protect t he craft paper from accumulating moisture. Both studies by \nRapp et al. [79] and Prevost [80] concurred that it is due to the high -water affinity of esters that moisture is \nabsorbed by the ester hence reducing the paper ageing and degradation.  \n \n \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci  ISSN: 2502-4752  \n \nAlternative liquid dielectrics in power transformer insulation: a review (Bokang Agripa Tlhabologo) \n1769 \n3.6.1. Effect of moisture content on ageing and kraft paper \nPerkasa et al. [81] used visual and Karl-Fischer titration to investigate the bubbles and water content \nin mineral oil and vegetable oil. Since vegetable oil is found to be more dense than mineral oil used in the \nstudy, the difference in height between the top windings and top oil level which determines hydrostatic \npressure that the oil exerts on the winding surfaces determines bubble formation. This is a cause for higher \nhotspots formation closer to th e winding hence more likelihood of bubble formation in vegetable oil -based \ndielectric than in mineral oil. For a wet insulation paper system, due to presence of moisture, there is lesser \nlikelihood of bubble formation in vegetable oil -based dielectric than  in mineral oil due to the higher bubble \ninception temperatures. The study further emphasises that on a different note, viscosity of ester -based \ndielectric is higher than that of mineral oil even though it decreases with time and temperature rise. The \npresence of moisture content also contributes to the increase in acid number in the dielectric when aging [82]. \nHowever, the natural ester oils have higher degree of polymerization than mineral oil therefore, the acid \nformed in ester-based dielectrics is less corrosive to the cellulose insulation [83]. \nIn 2015, Suwarno and Marbun [84] evaluated the effect of thermal aging on mixed dielectrics. The \nstudy applied the IEC 60156 standard stated in Table 1 at 2 kV/sec rise rate for BDV using liquid dielectric \ntest set LD60 and Megger KF875 Karl Fischer test set for moisture content analysis. In the methodology, \naccelerated aging is performed for 20, 40 , and 60 days for temperatures 120  °C and 150 °C in an oven. When \naging, gasses generated according to DGAs inc lude Hydrogen and these gases with free radicals forming \nwater molecules. This increases the moisture content in the samples in the first 20 days which momentarily \ndecreases BDV. However, after 20 days a decrease in water content is noted which is caused b y significant \nhydrolysis due to extended heating period. Therefore, the presence of ester oil in the mixture improves water \nabsorption and increase aging time and BDV of the power transformer dielectric. It is further concluded in a \n2020 study [85] that natural ester oil impregnated pressboard possesses 20% more breakdown strength than \nthat with mineral oil dielectric. \n \n3.6.2. Impacts of heating and use of additives on moisture content \nIn 2018, Beldjilali et al . [86] investigated physicochemical and isothermal charging currents of \nmixed vegetable olive -based oil and naphthenic mineral oil. Free water is pre -eliminated by heating the oil \nsamples independently, at 40 °C for 40 minutes for vegetable oil and 70 °C for 60 minutes for mineral oil. \nThe two samples are mixed at 10 different mixing ratios. The mixing is done at 800 turns/min for 30 minutes \nusing a magnetic stirring rod so that the mixture is dissolved and miscible. Moisture content is investigated \nusing Karl Fischer titration immediately after agitation. For more accuracy three samples are taken from the \nmixing bottle and their mean value considered. This accounts for the probability of non -homogeneity of the \nmixture. With these methods, it is concluded that wit h 15% of mixture being vegetable oil, all physical \nproperties of mineral oil are improved most optimally despite esters having high moisture content. This \nfurther emphasises that there is no standard mixing ratio [87] suggests that the more effective way  to \neliminate free water from the two sample is by heating them at 100 °C for both mineral and vegetable oil \nbecause the boiling point of water is 100 °C hence will be able to vaporise the water content.  \nIn 2020, Trnka et al. [88] uses broadband dielectric spectroscopy to investigate polarization effect of \npaper-natural esters in the presence of 0.53% Butylated Hydroxytoluene (2,6 -ditertiary-butylparacresol and \nAluminium oxide (Al 2O3). It is found that water content increases significantly in the paper-natural ester \nsubjected to thermal ageing. The Increase in water content is due to hydrolysis influenced by the presence of \nester. \n \n3.7.   Biodegradability \nSince existing mineral oil is non -biodegradable, further studies have been undertaken to investigate \nthe potential of ester oils usage for power transformer applications. Sindhuja et al. [89] applies OECD 301 B \nstandards for biodegradability, OECD 201 standards for effects of the oil on micro algae  growth, OECD 202 \nstandards for effect towards daphnids and OECD 203 standards for mortality measure on fish. The tests are \nperformed on new and aged natural ester-based dielectrics and the results showed that ester oils have no toxic \neffects on living organisms. Figure 3 shows the biodegradability rates of the different oils [2], [90]. \nPure natural esters show 99% biodegradability followed by syn thetic esters at 80%. Biodegradability \nof mineral oil is at 30% while silicone oil has been found to be 5% biodegradable  [2]. This makes mineral oil \nand silicon oil to be highly dangerous to any form of life around the transformer especially in case of o il \nspillages. \nBiodegradability and non-toxicity of natural esters makes them less harmful to the environment [91]. \nThe reaction products (low CO2, low corrosive sulphur, low CO emission and biodegradable when spilt to the \nground) formed due to thermal ag ing are of less risk hence the focus can be shifted towards defining the \noptimal combination and additive quantities to increase mixed dielectric biodegradability and improve \n                ISSN: 2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2021: 1761 - 1777 \n1770 \noxidation stability. Due to their biodegradable property, natural ester dielectri cs can replace mineral oil \nespecially in transformers near underground bodies [92]. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. The biodegradability rates of mineral, silicone, synthetic ester and natural ester oils  [2] \n \n \n4. MISCIBLE STUDIES \n4.1.   Use of nano particles \nStudies have proceeded to further explore the use of mixed dielectrics with multiple metal oxide \nNano particles preferably those with higher stability and simpler production techniques [93]. The method of \nusing Nanoparticles involves suspension of nanoparticles into the base transformer fluid. Such Nano particles \nof consideration include Iron (III) Oxide (Fe2O3), Al2O3, Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), Copper (II) Oxide (CuO), \nBoron Nitride (BN), Zinc Oxide (ZnO), Copper Peroxide (CuO2), and Silicon Dioxide (SiO2). It is also \nconsidered that they vary in conductivity and permittivity. It is more suitable to use Nano particles that do not \nagglomerate. This is to say that their particles do not form micro and macro sized attachments to one another. \nTwo methods of preparing nanofluid dielectrics are 1) one-step method and 2) two step method. \n \n4.1.1. One-step method \nFor one -step method, synthesis dispersion into the oil is carried out at the same time by the \nprocesses of physical vapor condensation to minimise agglomer ation and enhance uniform particle \ndistribution. The method also eliminates transportation and drying stages in the production line costs  [94]. \nHowever, this process requires very sophisticated equipment which significantly increases production costs. \nAnother limitation is that it becomes expensive to evaluate the effect of nanoparticles in the fluid because it \nrequires elimination of impurities and residues that accumulate as a result of incomplete reaction and \nstabilization during synthesis [95]. \n \n4.1.2. Two-step method \nThis method involves physical and chemical methods of synthesising dried powdered nanoparticles \nas an initial stage. The powdered nanoparticles are at another stage dispersed or suspended into the fluid \naided by ultrasonic or magnetic s tirring using sonication procedure. The method is deemed more economical \ncompared to one-stage method [95]. \nThe most common method to assess nanofluid stability is using visual examination and light \nscattering techniques. In exploration of natural ester -based nanofluids as dielectrics, [96] uses statistical \nanalysis for lightning impulse voltage for natural and synthetic ester oils -based Fe 3O4, Al 2O3, and SiO 2 \nNanofluids. It recommends the use of natural ester-based Nano fluids for liquid filled transformers.  \nAnother nanofluid developed composes of hexagon nitride (h -BN) nanoparticles and cottonseed oil . \nThe presence of h -BN enhanced impulse BDV and AC -BDV with 5% and 63.3%, respectively. However, as \npercentage weight increases the dissipation factor decreased, nonetheless, this nanofluid dielectric has great \npotential to be used to withstand electrical and thermal stresses in power transformers [97]. \nWhen using extrapolation in comparison of mineral oil with superior insulation fluid made of \nBaobab, Mongongo (as natural esters) and mineral oils under thermal aging, a blend of 5 ml Kerosene and \n100 ml o f oil  under ultrasonic wave treatment at 30 kHz reduced the rate of degradation, increasing the \nlifetime of copper plate and the k raft paper [8]. Even though nanofluid dielectrics have been found to have \n\nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci  ISSN: 2502-4752  \n \nAlternative liquid dielectrics in power transformer insulation: a review (Bokang Agripa Tlhabologo) \n1771 \nimproved anti-aging, BDV and particle discharge ch aracteristics [98], [99], adding nanofluids to dielectrics \nhas its limitations too. Limitations: \n− Addition of more particles increases oil viscosity. \n− Nanofluids have low specific heat capacity. \n− Also, the high cost of producing Nano fluids limits their use in large scale.  \n− They also have a lowered stability after long -term ageing due to the tendency to form micro and macro \nsized agglomerates. This further limit the ability to extend ageing procedu ral experiment of mixed \ndielectrics to be employed for nanofluids.  \n \n4.2.   Simulations \nCurrent studies are also using simulation to study flow dynamics, thermal efficiency, electric field \nstrength, and heat transfer properties. These computational flow si mulations are single -phase approach and \ntwo-phase approach [100]. Single-phase model has Buongiorno model as the most effective method over the \nThermal Dispersion model and Homogenous model  [93], [101]. As for two -phase model  [102], [103] use \nEulerian–Lagrange model and the Eulerian -Eulerian models.  Karimir et al . [104] also considers particle \naggregation in simulation modelling of nanofluid heat transfer.  This is a comprehensive and conclusive \ndevelopment in studying the possible use of  nanofluids for transformer dielectrics. This technique has been \nemployed in studying diffusion behaviour of water molecules in oil and cellulose. The simulation shows that \nindeed water molecules are bound to cellulose in the paper insulator. This is becau se cellulose and water \nmolecules can form hydrogen bonds [105]. \nComputerised technology has further brought evolution of molecular simulation technology \napplication to transformer dielectrics. Molecular simulation methodologies enable scholars to analyse  \nmicrophysical processes that take place in dielectrics at a micro level, yet they cannot be observable in \nphysical experimental studies. The four main methods of molecular simulation under current studies are: \nmolecular mechanics method, quantum mechanics  method, the molecular Monte Carlo method, and the \nmolecular dynamics method [106]. \n \n4.2.1. Molecular mechanics method \nThe method involves calculations that produce the system energy as a function of location and type \nof the particles’ nucleus. The poten tial energy becomes the force field as the simulation does not take into \nconsideration electron movement. Simulation is based on the principle that the molecular structure’s relative \npotential energy in the dielectric is to some degree depicted by the inte rnal stress [106]. \n \n4.2.2. Quantum mechanics method  \nThis method deals with applying computerized algorithms in calculating micro -parameters of a new \nsingle tiny molecule with specific kinetic energy at 0 °C in a vacuum  [106]. Computerised modelling tends to \nbe expensive and time consuming, however with development of high-speed computers reduces the time tied \nexpense of computation.  The method gets to circumvent th e expensive modelling.  Quantum mechanics \nmethod provides potentially highly accurate  free energy  simulations by  restraining potentials and  thus \nallowing customizable shape for quantum mechanics region for molecules with high binding affinity.   \n \n4.2.3. Molecular Monte Carlo method  \nThis method uses statistics analytical experimental methods to solve complex and multi -dimensional \nfactors in a simpler manner. It mathematically develops probability model for specified characteristics of a \ngiven problem. It then runs numerical simulation  experiment algorithms based on the probability model to \noutput the approximated solution [106], [107]. \n \n4.2.4. Molecular dynamics method  \nThis method calculates a good approximation of balance and transfer properties in a system of \nmicroscopic molecules as it considers a molecule as a research object. The rest of the system simulated is \ntaken as a group of particles that exhibit specific properties or characteristics. This simulation evaluates the \nmovement law and basic characteristi cs and rules of the molecule and the system at large [106]. This method \nhas been used by [108] when investigating the restraint effect and diffusion of water. It is concluded that as \nsimulated oil temperature increases there is a gradual increase in water diffusion. \nRuijin et al. [108] also used the molecular dynamic method in simulating the molecular model of \nfunction of furfural molecules’ radial distribution considering the diffusion coefficient with different \nmoisture content in the oil. The study con cludes that furfural and small molecule acids experience a \nsignificant reduction in diffusion ability when water content increases. This molecular simulation is more \noptimal to study viscosity of nanofluids using amorphous modelling tool.

Application of the different molecular simulations can be used in enhancing \nmicrostructures of the dielectrics in accordance to predicted needs for nanofluid dielectrics. \n \n \n5. CONCLUSION \nThe paper provides an overview and direction of evolution of transformer liquid dielectrics and the \npossible applications of mixed dielectrics. The main challenge in application o f natural esters in power \ntransformers is high viscosity. Therefore, it is recommended that mixing natural esters with mineral oil is to \nbe used to lower the viscosity in potential dielectrics. Future use of viscosity suppressants and additives is \nalso fea sible to reduce the high viscosity. Furthermore, mixing esters and mineral oil helps improve the \nphysical, chemical, electrical, aging, and dissolved gasses characteristics of current mineral oil -based \ninsulation fluids. The use of technical standards for developing insulating fluids in experimental analysis of \nmixed dielectrics provides platform for safer development of insulating liquids.  Statistical analysis methods \nhave also shown great potential in the evolution to predict and analyse potential mixed t ransformer dielectrics \nand justifying their superior fire safety, insulation , and ageing characteristics. With statistical analysis, it is \nviable to design reliability functions in future to detect the survival and hazard of mixed liquid insulators and \nalso determine their lower and upper extremities. Mixing ratios for mixed insulating dielectrics should be \nstudied further as future scope for optimization of liquid dielectrics. Mixed liquid dielectrics also show great \ncapability to replace pure mineral oil when simulated, analysed by chemical molecular modelling and \nmodified at a molecular level which can hardly be achieved when doing physical experiments.  \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] R.
