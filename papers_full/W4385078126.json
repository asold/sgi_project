  "abstract": "Large language models, powered by advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning, have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing tasks. These models, exemplified by OpenAI's GPT-3, possess the ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, rendering them invaluable across a wide range of applications. This paper provides an overview of large language models and their current use cases across various domains. The introduction elucidates the concept of large language models, elucidating their architectures, training methodologies, and capabilities. From an application standpoint, these models find utility in tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, language generation, and translation. Finally, the chapter concludes by identifying future directions for the development and application of large language models. It emphasizes the significance of ongoing research in areas including model interpretability, multi-modal learning, and domain adaptation, with the aim of further enhancing the capabilities and versatility of these models.",
