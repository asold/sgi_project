INTRODUCTION\nLarge power transformers constitute very expensive and vital\ncomponents in electric power systems [1]. The reliability\nof power transformers, which are critical core equipment in\npower transmission and distribution systems, dictates the safe\nand reliable performance of the entire electrical system [2].\nMost importantly, the stable and safe operation of power\ntransformer is of signiﬁcance to the normal operation of\npower system. The faults of power transformers will have\nserious impact on the safety of power grids [3]. It is necessary\nto pay attention to higher reliability of power transformers,\ndue to possible failures of an electric system and because of\ntheir cost [4].\nDue to above reasons, condition monitoring of trans-\nformer operation status has attracted more and more attention\nthroughout the world [5]. Winding mechanical deformation\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this article and approving\nit for publication was Canbing Li.\nfaults are one of common fault types of transformers.\nAt present, many winding mechanical fault diagnosis meth-\nods are proposed theoretically and practically, for instance,\nthe short-circuit impedance (SCI) method based on the\nprinciple of short-circuit impedance measurement, the low-\nvoltage impulse (LVI) method based on the principle of signal\nanalysis, the frequency response analysis (FRA) method, etc.\nIn SCI method, measured SCI of a phase winding is compared\nto the value that appears at the nameplate or factory test\nresults [6]. In LVI proposed by Lech, W. and Tyminski, L.\nin 1966 [7], time domain signals of winding before and after\nfault are compared and analyzed to present the information\nof winding deformation.\nAbove all, FRA method has been widely accepted because\nit’s economic, accurate, simple and fast. FRA, ﬁrstly intro-\nduced by Dick and Erven [8], has adopted sweep frequency\nsinuous signal to excite transformer windings and measured\nthe response signal in the frequency domain to construct a\nfrequency response signature [9]. The transformer winding\n112494 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. Liuet al.: Classifying Transformer Winding Deformation Fault Types and Degrees Using FRA Based on SVM\nis proven to be equivalent of an electrical network consisting\nof resistance, capacitance and inductance in high frequency\nrange, and its frequency response signature can represent the\nstatus of the winding [10]. The frequency response signa-\nture of the transformer after the factory production can be\nregarded as the mostly original, standard and healthy signa-\nture of the transformer, which is frequently called ﬁngerprint.\nBy comparing the frequency response curve of the subsequent\ntransformer in fault status with its ﬁngerprint, the speciﬁc\nfault type and severity of windings could be diagnosed [11].\nFrequency response signatures of transformers with the\nsame fault type always present the similar characteristics and\npatterns. On this basis, after comparing frequency response\nsignatures with the ﬁngerprint, the common characteristics\nof the certain fault type can be extracted. Based on this\nprinciple, it is only need to extract the different characteristics\nof frequency response signature with different faults; as a\nresult, the types of transformer winding mechanical faults\ncan be diagnosed. The same is true for the diagnosis of fault\ndegree. However, as so far, there is still no standard and\nreliable code for interpretation of FRA signature [12], [13], in\nwhich, the analysis of FRA mainly relies on visual inspection\nor mathematical calculation. The diagnosis result by visual\ninspection is easily affected by the subjectivity of personnel,\nwhile the winding fault type and degree are not easily recog-\nnized by simple mathematical calculation.\nRecently, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has developed as an\nadvanced technique which was successfully used in many\nﬁelds. Some relevant researches on the application of FRA\nand AI algorithm in transformer fault diagnosis have been\nsuccessively conducted. For instance, A. J. Ghanizadeh and\nG. B. Gharehpetian trained the neural network classiﬁers by\nprocessing the FRA data [14]. Bigdeli used SVM to diagnose\ntransformer winding fault on the basis of transfer function\n(TF) [15]. Zhao combined SVM with impulse frequency\nresponse analysis (IFRA) to diagnose transformer fault [16].\nDeng classiﬁed the transformer winding deformation based\non SVM and ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) [17]. However,\nin reference [14], the neural network is not ﬁt for the small\nsample data of transformer winding faults, sometimes it is\neasy to fall into the local optimal solution, which leads to\npremature maturity. What’s more, the required data for train-\ning and testing are obtained by the simulation in this study,\ninstead of the FRA data measured in the actual transformers.\nIn reference [15], only a few feature quantities have been\nextracted and applied to the fault diagnosis, which can be\nfurther improved. Reference [16] only diagnoses the fault\ntypes, without further classifying and predicting the degree\nof fault. In reference [17], the identiﬁcation of winding fault\nis based on the short circuit impedance method, not the FRA\nsignature; what’s more, the data for training are obtained by\nFEA. The optimization algorithm of SVM parameters can\nstill be further improved.\nIn view of above background, this study proposes the iden-\ntiﬁcation of actual transformer winding deformation faults\nby combining FRA and SVM. SVM is popular and powerful\ndue to its unique advantages in solving small sample, non-\nlinear and high-dimensional pattern recognition problems; it\nhas good generalization ability in the case of limited samples.\nThis is of great practical signiﬁcance for the fault diagnosis\nand prediction of power transformer, which, the identiﬁca-\ntion of winding deformation faults is always the problem\nof sample shortage and high nonlinearity between the fault\nphenomena and fault reasons [18].\nIn this study, the SVM model is trained by FRA data. The\nparameters of the SVM model are optimized by the particle\nswarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The characteristics of\ntransformer FRA signatures with different fault types and\ndegrees can be obtained by the SVM model, which is used for\nfault classiﬁcation. Besides, some characteristic features are\nintroduced by statistical analysis of FRA signatures. Both the\nfault types and degrees are comprehensively discriminated.\nIn addition, to compare the proposed method with the current\nstate of the art of SVM on discriminating FRA signatures, two\ncommon parameter optimization algorithms-the grid search\nalgorithm and genetic algorithm are also discussed in this\nstudy.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Firstly, the\nexperimental setup and the experimental results are intro-\nduced in the Section II. The key tools and procedures used\nin this study are described in the Section III. The classifying\nresults and analysis are presented in the Section IV . Refer to\nSection V for the details of conclusions of this study and\nfurther research work. All the data tables supporting this\narticle can be seen in Section VI.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULT\nA. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nIn this paper, a specially manufactured model transformer is\nadopted to perform all experiments. Detailed parameters of\nthe model transformer are shown in Tab. 1. Three common\ntransformer faults are simulated by experiments, namely,\ndisk space variation (DSV), inter-disk short circuit (SC) and\nradial deformation (RD). More information about the model\ntransformer and the detailed experimental setup can be found\nin [16], [19], [20].\nThe DSV fault has been revealed that the capacitance\nparameter dominates the effect and this fault could be emu-\nlated by changing the inter-disk capacitance parameter [11].\nThe inﬂuence of DSV fault on transformer is simulated by\nconnecting several disks with paralleled capacitors. The mag-\nnitude of capacitance indicates the degree of fault, including\n50 pF, 67 pF, 100 pF, 200 pF, 400 pF, 600 pF and 800 pF. The\ninﬂuence of SC fault on transformer is simulated by shorting\nthe connectors between the adjacent disks. The transformer\nmanufacturer also produced some windings with variable\ndeformations, which are used to replace the middle 10-disk\nwindings to simulate the RD faults [16]. The image of the\nwinding RD fault is shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1 (a),\nd represents the amount of RD, which is a variable, θ rep-\nresents the angle which is ﬁxed at 45 ◦, the ratio of d and the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 112495\nJ.

Design specifications of specifically manufactured model\ntransformer.\nwinding radius r are set to be 3%, 5%, 7% and 10% to emulate\nthe different degree of RDs produced at one direction [20].\nThere are also other RD fault windings in which the faults are\nmanufactured at different directions, but the ratio of d and r\nis ﬁxed at 5%, as shown in Figure 1(b) [16].\nFigure 2 (a) shows the schematic diagram of transformer\nexperiment and Figure 2 (b) indicates the image of measure-\nments of the research.\nAll fault emulated experiments are performed using FRA\nend to end open circuit connection. Two sets of FRA data\nunder transformer healthy status are measured and taken as\nthe standard FRA signatures. The reason why two sets of\nFRA data are chosen as the ﬁngerprints is that the measure-\nment errors were taken into account. In the process of FRA\nmeasurement, there are a number of unavoidable factors that\ncan interfere with the measurement results to varying degrees.\nTaking two sets of FRA data as the ﬁngerprints can weaken\nthe inﬂuence of measurement error on the diagnosis results\nto a certain extent. The two sets of data were named normal 1\nand normal 2.\nB. EXPERIMENTAL RESULT\nIn the case of SC fault, 15 groups of different frequency\nresponse data were measured. In the case of DSV fault,\n21 groups of different FRA data were obtained. RD fault\nexperiments were carried out with 18 different conditions.\nFigure 3 ∼5 show the comparison between the new measured\nFRA traces and the ﬁngerprint of transformer with different\nfault status, including variable fault degrees and locations,\nrespectively.\nIII. APPLICATION OF SVM TO DIAGNOSE\nWINDING FAULT\nA. BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE KEY TOOLS\nSVM has been in existence for a couple of decades, but it\nhas been developed as a powerful tool since it was ﬁrstly\nproposed by Vapnik in the ﬁeld of machine learning. The\napplication of SVM in fault diagnosis has attracted an increas-\ning attention in recent years due to its good classiﬁcation\nperformance. The SVM is based on the statistical learning\ntheory [21]. Generally speaking, it is a two-classiﬁcation\nmodel. Its basic model is described as a linear classiﬁer with\nthe largest spacing in feature space. Namely, the learning\nstrategy of the SVM is to maximize the spacing, which can be\nultimately transformed into a convex quadratic programming\nproblem.\nSVM is a classiﬁcation method based on structural risk\nminimization (SRM) criterion. The learning strategy is to\nmaximize the interval, and the solution of the optimal hyper-\nplane can ultimately be transformed into the solution of a\nconvex quadratic function problem [22]. It has particular\nadvantages of solving the classiﬁcation problem of small-\nscale samples, non-linearity, and high-dimension. According\nto Statistical Learning Theory (SLT), which is the theory of\nﬁnite sample statistics put forward by Vapnik et al[23]–[26],\n112496 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. Liuet al.: Classifying Transformer Winding Deformation Fault Types and Degrees Using FRA Based on SVM\nFIGURE 2.

Visualization of SC Fault Experiment Data (the solid line is\nfingerprint and the dotted line is new trace which corresponds to\ndifferent fault status).\nthe so-called structural risk minimization is to reduce\nthe Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the learn-\ning machine while ensure the classiﬁcation accuracy rate\nFIGURE 5. Visualization of RD Fault Experiment Data(the solid line is\nfingerprint and the dotted line is new trace which corresponds to\ndifferent fault degree).\n(empirical risk), so as to control the expected risk of the learn-\ning machine on the whole sample set [25]. The relationship\nbetween the expected risk and the empirical risk is shown by:\nRexp ≤Remp +8\n(n\nh\n)\n(1)\nwhere Rexp and Remp represent the expected risk and the\nempirical risk (the classiﬁcation accuracy rate), and 8is the\nconﬁdence interval that is related to the number of samples\nand the VC dimension, where n is the number of samples and\nh represent the VC dimension.\nThe conﬁdence interval 8in the above formula decreases\nmonotonously with the increase of ratio of n to h. In order\nto make the model has better generalization ability, it is\nnecessary to reduce the VC dimension while minimizing the\nempirical error. Deﬁne the classiﬁcation interval as ρ. At the\nρinterval, the VC dimension h of the hyperplane sets satisﬁes\nthe following relationship:\nh =f\n( 1\nρ2\n)\n(2)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 112497\nJ. Liuet al.: Classifying Transformer Winding Deformation Fault Types and Degrees Using FRA Based on SVM\nwhere f is a monotonic increasing function. It can be seen\nfrom Equation (2) that h is inversely proportional to the\nsquare of ρ. Thus, maximizing the sample interval can mini-\nmize the VC dimension to make the generalization ability of\nthe model stronger.\nIn summary, the principle of SVM is to maximize the\ninterval between two classes of samples in the process of\nsample classiﬁcation, so that the training model has strong\ngeneralization ability.\nThe most widely used radial basis function (RBF) is\nselected as the kernel function of the SVM algorithm in this\nstudy. The expression of the function is as follows:\nK (x,xi)=exp\n(\n−∥x −xi∥2\ng2\n)\n(3)\nThe LibSVM provides complete functions for training and\ntesting of SVM models [27].\nThe parameters of the SVM model are optimized by the\nPSO algorithm. The PSO algorithm was ﬁrstly proposed by\nEberhart and Kennedy in 1995 [28], [29]. Its basic concept\nstems from the study of foraging behavior of birds. The\nPSO algorithm emulates the behavioral characteristics of this\nbiological population and is used to solve the optimization\nproblem.\nThe initialization of the PSO algorithm is a group of ran-\ndom particles, and then the optimal solution is found through\nmultiple iterations. In each iteration, the particle updates itself\nthrough the optimal solution it calculates (namely the individ-\nual optimum) and the optimal solution currently calculated\nby the entire population (namely the global optimum). The\nformula for updating the velocity and position of particles is\nintroduced by Equation (4) and Equation (5).\nVi =W ∗Vi +C1 ∗R1 ∗(Ebest −Pi)\n+C2 ∗R2 ∗(Gbest −Pi) (4)\nPi =Pi +Vi (5)\nwhere Pi and Vi are the position and velocity of the i th\nparticle, respectively. C1 and C2 are acceleration constants,\nalso known as learning rates. W is an inertia constant, and\nR1 and R2 are random numbers in the range of 0 to 1.\nEbest represents the individual optimum and Gbest represents\nthe global optimum.\nPSO algorithm can be used in many ﬁelds because of its\nsuperior optimization performance, which plays an important\nrole in swarm intelligence algorithm.\nB. STRUCTURE OF DATA SETS\nExtracting the representative fault features is an important\nprerequisite for accurately discriminating the various types of\nfaults. At present, the mainstream feature extraction methods\nfrom FRA signatures are divided into two categories, the sta-\ntistical indicators and FRA signature waveform features [30].\nIn this study the feature extraction based on statistical indica-\ntors is used to quantify the difference between the ﬁngerprint\nand the measured new trace. Calculating statistical indicators\nis easy and fast, and the noise has little inﬂuence on the\ncalculation results [30].\nThe data used for training and testing of SVM model are\nexperimental FRA data of transformer as mentioned above.\nThe following Tab. 2 shows the eight different mathematical\nfeatures [31]–[33] of the measured data extracted by a series\nof mathematical operations between the new trace and the\nﬁngerprint, the calculate expression of the features is also pre-\nsented. These mathematical features include the Correlation\nCoefﬁcient (CC), the Euclidean Distance (ED), the maximum\nof difference (MAX), the Integral of Absolute difference (IA),\nTABLE 2. Extracted mathematical index.\n112498 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. Liuet al.: Classifying Transformer Winding Deformation Fault Types and Degrees Using FRA Based on SVM\nthe Sum Squared Error (SSE), the Sum Squared Ratio Error\n(SSRE), the Sum Squared Max-Min Ratio Error (SSMMRE)\nand Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\nThe reasons why these 8 features are chosen can be seen\nbelow. CC describes whether the relationship between two\nindependent variables is close. To a certain extent, it is to\ndescribe the similarity. ED is a commonly used deﬁnition\nof distance, which is the actual distance between two points\nin m-dimensional space. Its geometric meaning is clear.\nThe correlation coefﬁcient and Euclidean Distance are the\ntwo frequently used features of FRA signature for pattern\nrecognition. MAX represents the maximum range of data\nchanges. IA determines the gap between the new trace and\nthe ﬁngerprint. Intuitively speaking, it is the sum of the areas\nenclosed by two curves. The actual error can be reﬂected by\nthis index. Additionally, SSE and RMSE are similar, which\nexplain the dispersion between ﬁnger print and the new trace\nin different ways, and measure the deviation between them.\nAt last, SSRE and SSMMRE are similar, which highlight the\nimpact of relatively large errors and weaken the impact of\nrelatively small errors. In practical situations, the transformer\nis most likely diagnosed as a healthy state when the curve is\nslightly offset. However, when there is a large deviation in\nthe curves, the transformer may be identiﬁed as a fault state.\nThe characteristics of SSRE and SSMMRE conform to this\ncommon fault diagnosis criterion.\nThe form of data set is 111-by-8, where 111 represents 111\ngroups of data and 8 is the feature number. Additionally, it’s\nnot difﬁcult to understand that the form of data label matrix\nis 111-by-1. In other words, each group of data contains\neight components. The details are shown in the Tab. 3 and\nExpression (6).\n\n\n\nτ1,1 τ1,2 ··· τ1,8\nτ2,1 τ2,2 ... τ 2,8\n..\n. .\n.\n. ... .\n.\n.\nτi,1 τi,2 τi,j τi,8\n.\n.\n. .\n.\n. ... .\n.\n.\nτ110,1 τ110,2 ... τ 110,8\nτ111,1 τ111,2 ... τ 111,8\n\n\n\n(6)\nExpression (6) shows the detail structure of the data set,\nwhere τi,j represents the j th feature of the i th data group.\nWhen transformer fault types are classiﬁed, 1-3 rows of\ndata label matrix were set to 1 to represent health status,\nand 4-45 rows of data label matrix were set to 2 to represent\nDSV fault, 46-75 rows of data label matrix were set to 3 to\nrepresent SC fault, 76-111 rows of data label matrix were\nset to 4 to represent RD fault. 4,6,8,10...rows of data set\nwere taken as training set, and the corresponding rows of data\nlabel matrix were taken as training label matrix. Accordingly,\n5,7,9,11...rows of data set were taken as testing set, and the\ncorresponding rows of data label matrix were taken as testing\nlabel matrix.\nWhen classifying the degree of fault, because of the dif-\nﬁculty in quantifying the degree of the fault in the case of\nTABLE 3. Structure of data set and details of each group.\nSC fault, the SVM algorithm is only used to classify the\ncases of DSV fault and RD fault. In the case of DSV fault,\n4-24 rows of data set were taken as the training set and\n25-45 rows of data set were taken as the testing set. Data label\nmatrix can be determined by the fault level of corresponding\nrows. In addition, considering that the experimental FRA data\nare limited in the case of RD fault, only a few samples were\ntaken randomly as the testing set and the rest as the training\nset.\nC. PROCEDURE OF PROPOSED METHOD\nThe procedure of the proposed method is depicted in Figure 6.\nThe original data is used to plot the corresponding FRA\nsignatures, and then the features of the curves are extracted\nas the input of SVM.

Liuet al.: Classifying Transformer Winding Deformation Fault Types and Degrees Using FRA Based on SVM\nTABLE 10. Processing result of 1000 groups of randomized trials for\ndiscriminating RD fault degree in 3 times.\nWhen it comes to DSV level classiﬁcation, similarly,\nthe DSV fault data was divided into two equal parts, one\nfor training and another for testing. The training accuracy of\nmodel is 100% (21/21). The result of classifying the levels of\nDSV faults are presented in Tab. 8.\nAs shown in Tab. 8, basically, the fault degree of DSV can\nbe accurately identiﬁed by the model. It is remarkable that\nin the only wrong set of data, there is not much difference\nbetween what the model predicts (67pF) and what it actually\nis (50pF). Therefore, the model is capable of detecting the\nfault degrees of DSV fault.\nWhen classifying the degree of RD fault, testing set and\ntraining set are randomly extracted from data set. The follow-\ning tables are the classiﬁcation results of a typical training set\nand its testing set. The diagnostic accuracy rate varies with\nthe selection of testing sets and training sets. Anyway, it is\nnot difﬁcult to conclude that the classiﬁcation accuracy rate\nmust obey the statistical law. Based on this idea, 1000 groups\nof randomized trials were conducted for 3 times. In each\nof the randomized trials, 5 groups of FRA data of RD fault\nare selected randomly from the data set and taken as the\ntesting set, and the selected testing set cover all of the fault\ndegree. The rest of data are taken as the training set and cover\nall fault degrees, too. The average training accuracy of the\nabove 3000 random trials equals to 96.79%. The diagnostic\naccuracy rates of experimental data are listed in Tab. 10.\nIt can be concluded that the diagnostic accuracy rate for\ndiscriminating the winding RD fault degree is around 70%\nby the statistical law. The experimental data are visualized\nin Figure 7.\nE. COMPARISON OF PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION\nALGORITHMS BETWEEN PROPOSED METHOD AND\nCURRENT LITERATURE\nThe penalty coefﬁcient and kernel function parameters (C, g)\nof SVM model have a crucial impact on the performance of\nthe model. In other words, the quality of model parameters\ndetermines the performance of the model. In this study, except\nfor the PSO algorithms, the other two frequently used algo-\nrithms - the grid search and genetic algorithm are also used\nto optimize the (C, g).\nThe traditional parameter optimization method in the most\nof existing literatures is the grid search algorithm. In fact,\nthe grid search algorithm is essentially an enumeration\nmethod. In a given interval, many small mesh intervals are\nFIGURE 7. Visualization of randomized trails result.\nFIGURE 8. Result diagram of grid search algorithm.\ndivided according to the given step size. By calculating\nwhether the parameters in each mesh interval can reduce the\ntraining error of the model, the optimal parameters can be\ndetermined.\nIn addition, both of genetic algorithm and PSO algorithm\nare popular at the moment. They are quick and accurate to\nobtain the optimal parameters with greater probability.\nIn order to illustrate the differences of these three algo-\nrithms in optimizing parameters for the SVM model, taking\nthe classiﬁcation of fault types as an example, each method\nis debugged three times to calculate the most appropriate\nparameters. The debugging results of each optimization algo-\nrithm method are shown in the Tab. 11. Similar results were\nobtained for classiﬁcation of fault degree.\nFigure 8 ∼10 show the result diagrams of above parameter\noptimization methods, respectively.\nWhen the grid search algorithm is used to optimize the\nSVM parameters, the parameters are ﬁrst searched in a large\ninterval. The search interval and step size are then man-\nually adjusted referring to the results of parameter opti-\nmization. Thus, this method is often time-consuming in the\nearly search stage and the human intervention is needed.\nWhen genetic algorithm is used to optimize the parameters,\nVOLUME 7, 2019 112501\nJ.

Result diagram of genetic algorithm.\ngenetic algorithm involves operations such as crossover and\nmutation, which has strong randomness. Occasionally, the\nappropriate parameters cannot even be found. In most cases,\ngenetic algorithm can converge to an approximate optimal\nsolution as quickly as possible. When PSO is used to optimize\nthe SVM parameters, the convergence speed of the algorithm\nis fastest among the three methods, and the quality of the\nsolution is the best.\nIn summary, among the three methods of model parameter\nsearching algorithms, the traditional grid search algorithm is\nfar inferior to the current popular genetic algorithm and PSO.\nFIGURE 10. Result diagram of PSO algorithm.\nAmong them, the PSO algorithm is the best, which demon-\nstrates the advantages of the proposed method.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a method of combining SVM with FRA has\nbeen evaluated for discriminating fault types and degrees\nof transformer deformation faults. A series of experiments\nwere carried out on an actual transformer. Eight features\nare extracted from FRA raw data by mathematical statistical\ncalculation. FRA Data is used to train SVM model, and then\nPSO algorithm is used to optimize SVM model parameters.\nThe data processing result shows that the comprehensive\naccuracy rate of the diagnosis reaches up to 96.3% when the\nclassiﬁer is used to discriminate the fault types of winding\nDSV , SC and RD. When the trained classiﬁer is used to\nclassify the fault degree of DSV , the accuracy rate reaches up\nto 95.24%. In addition, the accuracy rate is around 70% when\nthe classiﬁer is applied to discriminate the fault degree of RD.\nThe applicability and effectiveness of the method has been\nalready demonstrated, the comparison result of the proposed\nmethod with other two parameter optimized methods demon-\nstrates the advantages of PSO method. Overall, the combina-\ntion of SVM and FRA has reached signiﬁcant potential for\ntransformer winding deformation fault diagnosis. In further\nresearch, fault location will be analyzed. Phase information of\nfrequency response can also be considered for fault diagnosis.\nIt is also practical and meaningful to use massive data of\nFRA to solve the actual fault diagnosis problems when more\nreliable SVM models are trained and obtained.\nAPPENDIX\nSee Tables 1–11.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C.
