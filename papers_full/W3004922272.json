Introduction\n An inductive transducer named the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) provides \nthe advantages of high resolution and durability. (1–3)  The LVDT is used in applications to \nmeasure  displacement, which can be observed in the engineering, industrial, automotive, \nmilitary, robotic, scientific, and medical equipment fields. (1–11)  The operation of the LVDT \nis based on the same principle as the transformer, which comprises a primary winding and \ntwo secondary windings with a moving core. (12,13)  The output signal of the LVDT is the \ndifference signal between two secondary winding signals.  Therefore, the LVDT signal is \ndirectly proportional to the position of the moving core that can be used to measure the \ndisplacement with high resolution.  When the excitation signal is applied to the primary \n476 Sensors and Materials , Vol. 32, No. 2 (2020)\nwinding of the LVDT, the secondary windings generate the LVDT output signal in the form of \nan amplitude modulation with suppressed carrier (AMSC). (13)  Thus, the displacement signal \ncan be extracted from the LVDT output signal using a synchronous demodulator based on a \npeak amplitude finder or an analog multiplier. (13–17)  The transfer characteristic of the LVDT \nprovides a nonlinear behavior for the moving core that varies in the maximum stroke range, \nwhich can be expressed as a third-order function of the core position. (2,12,18)  Note that the linear \noperating range of the LVDT exists only in the narrow range close to the zero crossing.  The \nlarge linear operating range of the LVDT with a compact structure is very useful for embedded \nmeasurement and instrumentation systems.  However, the large linear operating range of the \nLVDT requires a large structure that is unsuitable for the embedded systems.  In the past, \nthe linear operating range of the LVDT was extended by the fractional order technique. (19)  \nUnfortunately, this technique is suited to a special design of the LVDT that causes a complex \nand large structure.  The technique based on an artificial neural network (ANN) has been \nintroduced in the literature. (20,21)  This technique can extend the linear operating range of the \ncommercial LVDT using an adaptive inverse model.  The use of the ANN technique requires \na high-speed signal processor to calculate the adaptive inverse model.  This is inconvenient for \nthe embedded measurement system and uneconomical.  Moreover, the ANN technique provides \na large response time to obtain the linear displacement signal.\n In this paper, the circuit building block providing the inverse transfer characteristic of the \nLVDT is proposed.  The binomial series is used to estimate the inverse transfer characteristic of \nthe LVDT.  The LVDT output signal is demodulated to the displacement signal by the technique \nreported previously. (13)  The displacement signal is compensated to the linear displacement \nsignal by the proposed scheme.  Note that the proposed scheme can be implemented using only \ncommercially available devices.  The performance of the proposed technique is analyzed and \ndiscussed in detail.  Experimental results show that the maximum percentage error of about \n0.5% in the maximum stroke range is observed.  The linear operating range of the commercial \nLVDT can be extended more than 500% by using the proposed technique.  It is clearly seen \nthat the proposed technique exhibits the advantages of fast response, high accuracy, simple \nconfiguration, and low cost.\n2. Basic Principle of LVDT\n The LVDT principle is similar to that of a transformer that comprises a primary winding \nP, two identical secondary windings, S 1 and S2, and a moving core, as shown in Fig. 1(a).  Two \nsecondary windings are connected in opposed directions to generate the displacement signal.  \nThe amplitude of the displacement signal versus the core position is shown in Fig. 1(b).  The \nstructure of the LVDT is shown in Fig. 1(c), where the lengths of the primary winding and \nsecondary windings are defined as p and w , respectively, with the radius d O.  The number of \nturns in the primary winding and secondary windings are equal to n p and n s, respectively.  \nThe dimensions of the LVDT core are obtained as the radius d C and length L C.  The insulators \nbetween the primary winding and the secondary windings have a thickness of g .  The sinusoidal \nsignal vex = Vexsin(ωext) is applied as the excitation signal for the primary winding, where V ex \nSensors and Materials , Vol. 32, No. 2 (2020) 477\nand ωex are the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal signal, respectively.  If only the \nmagnitude of the LVDT signal is considered, then the secondary winding signals v S1 and v S2 \ncan be expressed as(12,22,23)\n \n2\n22\n11 7\n2 (2 )\n10 ln( / )\nex ex P S\nS\nCP O C\nV nn l pvl\nwL Z d d\nπω += , (1a)\nand\n \n2\n21\n22 7\n2 (2 )\n10 ln( / )\nex ex P S\nS\nCP O C\nV nn l pvl\nwL Z d d\nπω += , (1b)\nwhere ZP denotes the impedance of the primary winding, and l 1 and l 2 are the lengths of the \ncore penetrating into the secondary windings S 1 and S 2, respectively.  From the structure of \nthe LVDT, the displacement signal can be obtained from the difference signal between two \nsecondary winding signals, v d = (vS1 – vS2), and can be stated as\n 2\n12(1 )dv Kl K l= − , (2)\nFig. 1.

Practically, the length p is larger than the gap g or p >> g.  From Fig. 1(c), \nthe length L C can be approximated as L C = 3 p; then, the difference signal v d of Eq. (2) can be \ngiven by(4,12,24)\n \n2 3\n2\n72\n8 2 (1 )310 ln( / ) 2\nex ex P S\nd tn\nP OC\nV nn plv l kl k lwZ dd p\nπω \n= −= −\n, (3)\nwhere kt and k n are the sensitivity and nonlinear coefficient of the LVDT, respectively.  The \ndifference signal v d of Eq. (3) exhibits only the amplitude of the AMSC from the LVDT output \nsignal versus the excitation signal.  To extract the displacement signal from the LVDT output \nsignal, the synchronous demodulator is required to generate the envelope of the difference \nsignal vd.  Note that the response of the demodulated signal is nonlinear along the entire core \nposition, as shown in Fig. 1(b).  The linear range of the LVDT transfer characteristic lies in a \nnarrow range close to the zero crossing of the LVDT response curve.  The LVDT signal v d can \nbe approximated as linear for the moving core varying in the narrow range close to the zero \ncrossing of the LVDT transfer characteristic curve in Fig. 1(b).  Thus, the difference signal v d \ncan be expressed as being in linear proportion to the core position l as\n vd = ktl. (4)\n From Eqs. (2) and (3), the linear range defined by l L of Eq. (4) is limited by the nonlinear \ncoefficient kn.  Practically, the nonlinear coefficient k n is described in terms of the acceptable \nerror εL of the LVDT output signal.  Therefore, the linear range lL can be expressed as (23)\n L\nL\nn\nl k\nε=± . (5)\n From the specifications of the LVDT used in this work, the acceptable error εL is equal to 0.5% \nand kn = 1.106 × 10−3 V/mm2; then, the linear range lL is about ±2.13 mm.\n3. Proposed Technique\n The nonlinear term in parentheses in Eq. (3) causes the narrow linear operating range of the \nLVDT.  This nonlinear term can be compensated using the inverse property N(l) to extend the \nlinear operating range as\n 2\n1()\n(1 ) d\nNl\nvα\n=\n−\n, (6)\nSensors and Materials , Vol. 32, No. 2 (2020) 479\nwhere α is the weighting coefficient used to minimize the error of the displacement signal.  \nPractically, the magnitude of the term k nl2 in Eq. (3) is |knl2| < 1.  This is because the nonlinear \ncoefficient kn of a commercial LVDT is very small and unaffected when the displacement l \napproaches zero.  Consequently, the weighting coefficient α in Eq. (6) is α < 1.  If the maximum \nvalue of the displacement signal vd is assigned for the condition of |αvd2| < 1, then Eq. (6) can be \nexpanded using the binomial series as (24)\n 2 22 23( ) 1 () () dd dNl v v v αα α= ++ + + . (7)\n From Eq. (7), the higher order terms can be neglected when | αvd2| < 1.  Then, the nonlinear \nterm N(l) can be approximated as\n 2() 1 dNl v α= + . (8)\n From Eq. (3), the nonlinear term (1 – knl2) can be compensated by the term N(l) of Eq. (7).  \nThe block diagram for the linearization of the LVDT behavior is shown in Fig. 2(a).  From \nFig. 2(a), the output signal vol versus the signal vd can be stated as\n 32 (1 )ol d d d dv v vv v αα= +=+ . (9)\n From Eq.

(11)\n The relative error of the output signal vol, defined by εol, can be expressed as\n 2 2 2 4 2 26 2 38( ) 3 3 100%o l t n tn tn tnk k l kkl kkl kklεα α α α= −− + − ×  . (12)\n The plot of Eq. (12) is shown in Fig. 2(b) and used to determine the coefficient α .  From Fig. \n2(b), if the relative error ε ol of about 0.5% is assigned to equal the specification of the LVDT \nused in this work with the linear stroke range of about ±1.9 mm, then the weighting coefficient \nα = 0.187 is observed at the core position l = ±9.8 mm.  Note that the linear stroke range can be \nextended from ±1.9 to ±9.8 mm.  The circuit diagram containing the property of Eq. (9) can be \nsimply implemented using the analog multipliers and summing amplifier, as shown in Fig. 3(a).  \nNote that the commercial analog multiplier provides an attenuation factor η .  The summing \namplifier comprises an operational amplifier (opamp), resistors R 1–R3, and variable resistor R n, \nas shown inside the dashed-line block in Fig. 3(a).  Therefore, the output signal v ol in Fig. 3(a) \ncan be given by\nFig. 3.

Note that the output signal \nvol of the scheme in Fig. 3(a) is 180° out of phase.  The parameters of the LVDT used in this \nwork are measured from the experimental implementation as k t = 84.817 mV/mm/V, k n = \n1.106 × 10−3 mm−2, and l L = ±1.9 mm for the relative error of 0.5%.  The parameter k n can be \ncalculated from a maximum value of the transfer characteristic curve of the LVDT and Eq. (3) \nas  \n 3\nt m dm\nn\ntm\nkl vk\nkl\n−= , (14)\nwhere vdm and l m are the maximum value of the LVDT transfer characteristic curve and \nthe position along the length of the moving core at the maximum voltage v dm, respectively.  \nSimulation results of the LVDT reverse transfer characteristic in Fig. 3(b) and the linearization \nof the LVDT behavior using the proposed technique for an excitation signal with the peak \namplitude of 1 V in Fig. 3(c) were obtained using the PSPICE analog simulation program.  It can \nbe seen that the linear operating range of the LVDT used in this study can be extended more \nthan fivefold.\n4. Performance of Proposed Scheme\n Deviation from the ideal performance of the proposed scheme is caused by the nonideal \ncharacteristics of the analog multipliers and the tolerance of the resistors used in the summing \namplifier.  From Fig. 3(a), the output signal vol caused by the errors of the analog multipliers and \nthe nonideal factor between the resistors R1 and R2, defined as Δ12, can be expressed as\n ( )\n2333 1\n12 12\n12 2\n1ol d d m d\nRR Rvvv vRR Rη ∆ε ηββ\n= − + −+\n\n, (15)\nwhere εm12 denotes the error of the analog multipliers.  From Eq. (15), the amplification factor \nβ can be varied to assign the term ( R3/βR1) = KL, where KL is the gain of the proposed scheme.  \nTherefore, Eq. (15) can be rewritten as\n ( )\n2311\n12 12\n22\n1ol L d d m L d\nRRv Kv v K vRRη ∆ε η= − + −+\n\n. (16) \n From Eq. (16), the second term on the right-hand side, that is, the error term, can be \nminimized by replacing the resistor R 2 with the variable resistor.  If the resistance R 2 is varied \n482 Sensors and Materials , Vol. 32, No. 2 (2020)\nto approach the expected value, then the relative error of the output signal vol, defined as εoc, can \nbe expressed as\n \n2\n1 12 12\n21\n2\n2\n()\n100%\n1\nmd\noc\nd\nRv\nRRv R\nη∆ εε\nη\n+\n= ×\n+\n\n. (17)\n If the resistances R 1 and R 2 are chosen to satisfy the nonideal factor Δ 12 of about 0.2%, \nerror εm12 = 0.4%, ( ηR1/R2) = 0.187,  and the peak amplitude of the signal v d = 762.97 mV \ncorresponding to the core displacement l = 9.8 mm, then the relative error ε oc of about 0.06% \nis calculated.  Note that the relative error ε oc is very small.  Therefore, the inaccuracy of the \nproposed technique corresponding to the relative error εoc can be neglected.  From Eqs. (12) and (17), \nit can be seen that the major factor contributing to the inaccuracy of the proposed technique is \nthe relative error εol.\n5. Experimental Results\n The proposed scheme in Fig. 3(a) was constructed using commercially available devices to \ndemonstrate its performance, as shown in Fig. 4(a).  The active devices used in this study were \nthe analog multiplier AD633 and opamp LF351.  The analog multiplier AD633 provides an \nattenuation factor of about 0.1.  Therefore, η = 0.01 was obtained.  The resistors R1 = R3 = 20 kΩ \nwith 0.2% tolerance were chosen.  From Eq. (12) and Fig. 2(b), ηR 1/R2 was equal to 0.187.  \nThus, the resistance R 2 was calculated as 10.7 kΩ.  The resistor R2 was replaced by the variable \nresistor to tune the resistance to be close to the calculated value.  The variable resistor R n of \n1 kΩ was chosen.  The power supply was set as ±9 V.  The nonlinearity error of the term vd 2 \nwas measured to be about 0.4% or ε m12 = 4 × 10 −3.  The commercially available LVDT used \nin this study provides the following specifications: linear stroke range of ±2 mm, maximum \nrelative error of 0.5%, and sensitivity k t = 94.5 mV/mm/V.

(b) Experimental setup.\n(a) (b)\nSensors and Materials , Vol. 32, No. 2 (2020) 483\nthe LVDT is set as a 2.5 kHz sinusoidal wave with a 2 V peak-to-peak amplitude.  In this \nexperiment, the output signal of the LVDT is demodulated using the technique proposed in the \nliterature(13).  The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 4(b).  The practical behavior of the LVDT \nis measured and shown in Fig. 5 to extract the parameters.  The parameters of the LVDT can be \ndetermined as follows.  The sensitivity of the LVDT is determined to be 84.817 mV/mm/V.\n The maximum amplitude of the LVDT signal v dm is 971.55 mV at the maximum stroke or \nlm = ±16 mm, and the linear range of the LVDT is about ±1.9 mm for the relative error of 0.5%.  \nThe nonlinear coefficient k n can be calculated using Eq. (14) as 1.106 × 10 −3 V/mm 2.  The \nLVDT inverse transfer characteristic of the proposed scheme is shown in Fig. 6(a), where the \ndifference signal v d is assigned as ( vs2 − vs1) or – vd for the inverse operation of the signal v ol.  \nThe demodulated LVDT signal is synthesized using the LabVIEW program and analog input/\noutput board from National Instruments (NI-USB-6009) to demonstrate the performance of the \nproposed technique, where the LVDT parameters are set to the same parameters as the practical \nLVDT used in this study.  The synthesized signal is applied to the scheme in Fig. 3(a) for the \npeak amplitude of ±971.55 mV corresponding to the core position of ±16 mm.  The measured \nFig. 5.

It can be seen that \nthe proposed technique can extend the linear operating range from ±1.9 to ±9.8 mm.  Figure \n7(a) shows the plot of the average voltage of the output signal v ol from the circuit in Fig. 3(a) \nof 5 repeated measurements for each core position from –9.8 to 9.8 mm.  The sensitivity of \nthe proposed scheme is set to 100 mV/mm/V by adjusting the variable resistor R n to vary the \namplification factor β.  The relative error εr of the measured signal vol is shown in Fig. 7(b).  The \nmaximum relative error εr of the measured result in Fig. 7(b) corresponding to the absolute error \nεam of about 46 µm is observed, where the maximum relative error ε r occurs at the core position \nof ±9.8 mm.  The full-scale error of the proposed technique, defined as ε fs, can be stated as\n \nmax( ) 100%max( )\nam\nfs stroke range\nεε = × . (18)\n If the maximum absolute error εam is equal to 46 µm, the full-scale error ε fs is calculated to \nbe about 0.23%.  \n6. Conclusions\n The inverse transfer characteristic of an LVDT based on a binomial series was proposed in \nthis paper.  A simple circuit configuration comprising analog multipliers and an opamp was \nadopted for synthesizing the LVDT inverse transfer characteristic without a specific device.  \nThe linear operating range of the LVDT was extended more than fivefold from the LVDT \nspecification used in this study, that is, from ±1.9 to ±9.8 mm.  The performance of the proposed \ncircuit was confirmed by experimental implementation.  The proposed circuit can be used as \na signal conditioner to measure a large displacement using a small-structure LVDT with very \ngood performance.  The proposed technique exhibits a simple configuration that is suitable for \nmeasurement systems used in small areas such as a miniature robot and an embedded system.\nFig. 7.
