  "abstract": "The management of the power transformer population is a complex process, as the grid companies operate thousands of devices. For this issue, the health index method can be applied to facilitate asset management. The algorithm can be used not only in the technical assessment of the individual units, but also to determine the relationships within the whole population. In this paper, the presented health index method consists of periodic oil diagnostics, including the physicochemical properties, dissolved gas analysis, and furfural content, and further assessment in terms of the criticality of the device to determine the technical condition. The algorithm was specifically designed to reflect even the smallest changes of the input parameters in the final score. The performance of the health index was tested on 620 oil analyses from 220 transformers divided into four subpopulations based on the service conditions. The results have proven to be largely dependent on the criticality level and the operating conditions of the device. The analysis of the study group has shown the influence of corrective maintenance on the mean value of the health index score.",
