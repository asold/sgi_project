    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of crop production is essential in effectively managing the food security and economic resilience of agricultural countries. This study evaluates the performance of statistical and machine learning-based methods for large-scale crop production forecasting. We predict the quarterly production of 325 crops (including fruits, vegetables, cereals, non-food, and industrial crops) across 83 provinces in the Philippines. Using a comprehensive dataset of 10,949 time series over 13 years, we demonstrate that a global forecasting approach using a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, the transformer, significantly outperforms popular tree-based machine learning techniques and traditional local forecasting approaches built on statistical and baseline methods. Our results show a significant 84.93%, 80.69%, and 79.54% improvement in normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), normalized deviation (ND), and modified symmetric mean absolute percentage error (msMAPE), respectively, over the next-best methods. By leveraging cross-series information, our proposed method is scalable and works well even with time series that are short, sparse, intermittent, or exhibit structural breaks/regime shifts. The results of this study further advance the field of applied forecasting in agricultural production and provide a practical and effective decision-support tool for policymakers that oversee crop production and the agriculture sector on a national scale.",
