INTRODUCTION \nWith the rapid development of the Internet, massive \nmultimedia information is being disseminated, which poses \na significant  challenge to Internet security due to the attacks \nof hackers and information leaks. Therefore, preventing \nnetwork intrusion has become the central issue of network \nsecurity. To address this problem, the development of \nintrusion detection technology has become necessary. Our \nmain objective is to create a network intrusion detection \nsystem that is both secure and effective. To date, numerous \nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been designed \nutilizing various technologies, including traditional visual \nanalysis [1] and machine learning [2]. \nSupervised algorithms like Naive Bayes (NB) [4] and \nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) [3] are commonly \nemployed in traditional machine learning for solving \nclassification problems. However, they must repeatedly \nlabel a substantial amount of data, which is time-consuming \nand laborious. On the other hand, unsupervised algorithms \nlike Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [6] and Gaussian \nMixture Model (GMM) [5] can discover hidden structures \nand information in the data without data labeling. However, \ntheir prediction accuracy is low, and evaluating the model's \nperformance is challenging.  \nVisual analysis can transform abstract information into \nunderstandable image data, making it easier for people to \ndiscover patterns in network security data and alarm \ninformation. However, personal subjective factors can lead \nto different interpretations o f the same data.  \nDeep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural \nNetwork (CNN) [7], Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [8], \nand Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [9] have their \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

RNN is helpful for processing sequence data \nand can capture dependencies between sequences. \nHowever, in some cases involving long -term dependencies, \ndeep learning models may encounter issues with gradient \nexplosion and vanishing during training . It  is not parallel \ncomputing, which affects training speed. GAN can solve \nimbalanced data problems in intrusion detection by using a \ngenerator and a discriminator. When the network layer is \ndeep enough in CNN , it can parallelly compute and capture \nremote features. However, deep convolution's [10] effect is \nnot always ideal, as learning remote dependency \nrelationships mainly depends on the length of the path \nthrough which forward and backward signals pass in the \nnetwork [11]. \nVision Transformer (VIT) [12] addresses the issues of \nmodeling global dependencies in inputs and outputs \nthrough attention mechanisms while avoiding recurrent \nstructures and enabling parallel computing capabilities. By \ncalculating the correlation between any two positions \nregardless o f distance, the attention mechanism allows for \nbetter and faster feature extraction. Additionally, the VIT's \nmulti-head attention mechanism obtains richer feature \ninformation by forming multiple subspaces and extensively \nutilizing information from differen t representation \nsubspaces at different locations.  \nBased on the advantages above , we propose a new \nintrusion detection model called Deformable Vision \nTransformer (DE -VIT) tailored to the task . To achieve this, \nwe have enhanced the VIT model , which has several \nadvantages. Specifically, we have addressed the limitation \nof VIT ignoring local structures when directly segmenting \nimages into fixed -length tokens by suggesting using a \nsliding window mechanism to segment the data. This \napproach improves edge information preservation. \nAdditionally, we have introduced a deformable attention \nmechanism to avoid excessive memory and computational \ncosts resulting from using dense self -attention in VIT. \nFurthermore, features may be affected by irrelevant parts \nbeyond the region of interest. Specifically, having too many \nkeys for each query patch will result in high computational \ncosts, slow convergence, and an incr eased risk of \noverfitting.  \nIn contrast, the convolution module [13] uses deformable \nconvolution to enlarge the receptive field of each patch \nwithout increasing the convolution kernel. The model uses \na hierarchical focal loss function to assign weights to \nsamples with different categories [14]. This approach \neffectively addresses prediction errors and reduces the \nimpact of outliers on the model, thereby enhancing the \nclassification performance. The simulation experiments \nconducted on the CIC IDS2017 [33] and UNSW-NB15 [34] \ndatasets show that our proposed intrusion detection method  \nhas significantly improved accuracy.  \nOverall, the contributions of this paper are as follows:   \nFirstly, we propose DE -VIT, which improves upon \ntraditional neural networks like CNN by addressing their \npoor performance in global information perception [15]. \nThis improvement bolsters the detection model's \ngeneralization ability.  \nSecondly, we use a small convolution kernel and stride \ninstead of the original hard segmentation . This enables \nbetter correlation modeling between each patch and its \nadjacent patches, allowing for better modeling of local \ninformation such as edges and lines.  \nThirdly, we introduce a deformable attention mechanism \n[16] for computing the correlation between two positions. \nSo that the model can extract features more effectively,  \nfocus on relevant regions, capture more information \nfeatures, and reduce computation. Additionally, \ndeformable convolution [17] increases the receptive field \nof each patch without increasing the convolution kernel \nsize. This allows each patch to contain more information, \nresulting in a more efficient feature extraction process.  \nFourthly, we add sine and cosine positional encoding to \nassign position information to each feature. This helps the \nmodel understand their relationships since different \npositions represent different features.  \nFinally, we use the hierarchical focal loss function to \nsolve the data imbalance problem and improve the \nclassification performance by reducing the impact of \noutliers on the model.  \nThe rest of this article follows: Part II introduces the \nrelevant information to be consulted. Part III proposes an \nimproved DE -VIT intrusion detection model. Part IV \nprovides binary and multiclass experimental results and \ncompares them with other methods. Part V is the summary \nof the full text . \nII. RELATED WORK \nSecurity issues have recently plagued Network-based \nIntrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) . Our focus is on \nfinding solutions to these problems. Traditional machine \nlearning and deep learning, particularly deep learning, are \nthe preferred solutions. Deep learning outperforms \ntraditional machine learning algorithms in processing data \nin different fields , such as natural language, image, and \nspeech. It has also proven to be highly effective in intrusion \ndetection. However, machine learning has its limitations. \nFor instance, Mishra and colleagues [37] conducted a \ncomprehensive study and survey of different machine -\nlearning algorithms used in intrusion detection. They \noutlined the limitations of various technologies. For \nexample, If the data contains misclassified instances, \nSupport Vector Machines (SVM ) [18] may fail to find the \nseparating hyperplane. The Naive Bayes classifier [19] \ntypically assumes attribute independence, which may not \nhold in practical applications. Decision trees [20] can be \nprone to overfitting if the model becomes overly complex \nand fits too closely to the training data, resulting in poor \ngeneralization ability to new data. Random forests [21] may \nhave high computational costs and perform poorly on \nimbalanced datasets. Additionally, the K -Nearest \nNeighbors (KNN) algorithm [22] is affected by the \nselection of the distance measure and the value of K [23]. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

For instance, Khan et al.  [24] proposed a \nnew framework for Network Intrusion Detection System \n(NIDS) based on deep convolutional neural networks. They \nutilized network spectrum images generated by short -time \nFourier transform. The objective of this solution is to \novercome the challeng e of high False Alarm Rates (FAR) \nencountered when detecting new attacks, which has been a \npersistent issue for existing NIDS solutions. To address this \nchallenge, Lopez -Martin et al.  [25] introduced a novel \nmethod for network intrusion detection. Their approach \nutilizes an extended radial basis function neural network \nand offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, they \nemploy an extended Radial Basis Function Neural Network \n(RBFNN) in offline reinforcement learning algorithms as a \npolicy network . This allows for the end -to-end learning of \nall parameters and network weights of RBF functions \nthrough gradient descent  without needing external \noptimization. The proposed method was tested on five \ncommon intrusion detection datasets (UNSW -NB15, NSL-\nKDD, AWID, CIC IDS2017, and CIC DDOS2019)  and \nachieved good performance indicators. However, this \nmethod may become slow when dealing with large -scale \ndata. Additionally, offline reinforcement learning methods \nrequire storing historical data for training, which may \nrequire a large amount of stora ge space. Furthermore, since \nhistorical data may not fully cover all cases, the trained \nmodel may not adapt to all situations.  \nRecently, Xu et al.  [26] introduced the Multilayer \nIntrusion Detection Model that employs Stacked \nBidirectional Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM), \nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Convolutional \nDenoising Autoencoders (SCDAE), and self -attention \nmechanisms to improve the accuracy of the model. The \nmodel also utilizes attention mechanisms to extract features \nand classify network traffic data. However, this model's \npracticality and scalability in real -world scenarios may be \nlimited due to its requirement for a significant amount of \ntraining data and computing resources to achieve high \naccuracy. In another study [27], this paper explores using \nGraph Neural Networks (GNN) in network security \nintrusion detection. It focuses explicitly  on applying graph \nrepresentation learning techniques in intrusion detection. \nGNN can learn effective representations from graph -\nstructured data without external domain knowledge, which \nis crucial for effective detection. However, GNN's \ncomputational cost may be high, and it may perform  poorly \non small or sparse graphs because they require a certain degree \nof connectivity to learn effective representations. Further \nimprovement is still needed. \nYang et al. [28] proposed an improved wireless network \nintrusion detection method based on a convolutional neural \nnetwork. Compared with traditional models, this method has a \nlower false positive rate, higher true positive rate, and higher \ndetection accuracy. However, this method is based on specific \ndatasets and has not been further tested and validated, which \nmay not be suitable for real-world scenarios or other datasets. \nKim et al.  [29] proposed a method for early detection of \nnetwork intrusion using a type of classifier based on \nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GAN). This method takes \nthe packet data as the input feature and judges whether the data \npacket is malicious traffic through the model, enabling real -\ntime and accurate intrusion detection without the delay time of \nsession termination or collecting a certain number of packets. \nNonetheless, the problem of dilution of  intrusion features \ncaused by timeouts and traffic outside the intrusion cycle still \nexists. Despite the emergence of numerous new deep learning \nmodels, most still operate by processing data on request. \nHowever, this approach overlooks the potential correlation \nbetween data requests in adjacent time frames. \nIn 2017, the Google team proposed the Transformer [30], \nwhich quickly became popular and was widely applied in \nnatural language processing. The subsequent BERT [31] \nmodel has been commonly used in machine translation, text \ngeneration, and other tasks. Previous neural network models \noften have their limitations, such as convolutional neural \nnetwork (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), which \nstruggled with processing sequential data due to issues like \nRNNs' gradient vanishing problem and CNNs' weak local \nperception ability, the Transformer overcomes these \nshortcomings. It supports parallel computing and better global \ninformation representation and  has long-sequence solid  \nmodeling capabilities. In 2020, the Vision Transformer (VIT) \n[12] emerged, applying the Transformer to the field of vision \nand achieving excellent performance in computer vision tasks. \nHowever, in the traditional attention mechanism, each \nfeature calculates the relationship with the entire feature map, \nso using the dense self-attention mechanism in VIT will cause \nexcessive memory and computational costs, and the features \nmay be affected beyond the area of interest. Due to the impact \nof irrelevant parts, too many keys per query patch will incur \nhigh computational costs and slow convergence, increasing \nthe risk of overfitting. Therefore, a deformable attention \nmechanism [16] method is proposed. Each feature only \ncalculates the relationship with surrounding features, which \nreduces the computing power and avoids the influence of \nirrelevant feature areas.  \nAt the same time, compared with other traditional neural \nnetworks, it also has the advantage  of focusing on key \ninformation and processing long sequences.  For example, \ncompared with convolutional neural networks, the deformable \nattention mechanism is better able to capture global \ninformation because it can pay attention to all positions in the \ninput sequence simultaneously, thereby better understanding \nthe relationship between contexts, and can directly process the \nentire sequence without losing position information, so it is \nmore suitable for handling dependencies between different \npositions.  Compared with recurrent neural networks, the \ndeformable attention mechanism allows the output of all \npositions to be calculated simultaneously  to achieve better \nparallel computing and improve the training and inference \nefficiency of the model.

Therefore, it has broader \napplication capabilities in various tasks and fields  without \nbeing limited by data type. In summary, the application of the \ndeformable attention mechanism in network intrusion \ndetection is very suitable, and the current application of this \nmethod in network intrusion detection is scarce. It provides a \nreference for other colleagues to conduct further research. \nIII. METHODS \nFig. 1 presents the flow chart of the complete model \nframework. The model has been enhanced based on the \noriginal VIT, forming a new DE -VIT model. The overall \nsteps of the model are as follows:  \nStep 1: In the original datasets, the CIC IDS2017 and \nUNSW-NB15 datasets each consist of 80 and 48 features, \nrespectively, represented in numerical and textual formats. \nNon-numeric attributes are subjected to one-hot encoding to \nfacilitate the model's handling of these features. Additionally, \nrows containing Not a Number  (NaN) and infinity (INF) \nvalues and irrelevant numerical columns  are excluded. \nFollowing this preprocessing step, we obtain a row of 64 \nfeature sequences of numerical values. This sequence is then \nreshaped into an 8x8 image matrix. \nStep 2: After obtaining the feature images, undergo \nprocessing through a deformable convolution layer with a \nsmall stride of 1 and 3x3 convolution kernel to extract image \nfeatures. The extracted features are then passed through an \nembedding layer for encoding, incorporating position \nencoding. Finally, the encoded features are fed into a \ndeformable attention layer, enabling the model to focus on \nspecific regions of interest, thereby improving the model's \ncomprehension of image information. After training, the \nmodel parameters  retain memorized image information \ncorresponding to each category, facilitating subsequent data \nclassification. \nA. FEATURE EXTRACTION \nThe earliest transformers were used to process one -\ndimensional sequence data. After the appearance of the Vision \nTransformer (VIT) [12], the application of the transformer in \nthe image field became a reality. To achieve this, the image \n𝑋 ∈ ℝ𝐻×𝑊×𝐶  is partitioned into blocks to obtain 𝑋𝑃 ∈\nℝ𝑁×(𝑃×𝑃×𝐶) . However, this approach may cause loss of \nstructural information at the segmentation boundary, which is \nnot conducive to modeling features such as image edges. A \nsliding window mechanism is proposed to segment the data to \naddress this issue. Moreover, deformable convolution is used \ninstead of regular 2D convolution to increase the receptive \nfield of each patch. This has three benefits: \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n \nVOLUME XX, 2017 1 \n1. The proposed method utilizes adjacent position and edge \ninformation, effectively enhancing the correlation between \neach patch and establishing a connection with its neighbors. \nThis approach enables the model to understand global \ninformation better and improve overall performance. \n2. The input size constraints of the VIT model can be \nrelaxed by using a sliding window approach to segment the \nimage instead of strictly dividing it into equal -sized blocks. \nThis method eliminates the requirement of dividing the image \ninto 𝑁 = 𝐻 × 𝑊/(𝑃 × 𝑃) blocks of equal size, as specified \nby the standard VIT model. \n3. Deformable convolution [17] allows the convolution \nkernel to have an offset so that it can have a larger receptive \nfield and better perceive global information without increasing \nthe size of the kernel. \nIn traditional natural language processing tasks, word \nposition information is included, whereas in Transformer -\nbased models, this information is discarded. However, patch \nposition order contains important structural information for \nimages that must be preserved. Therefore, a sinusoidal \npositional encoding is proposed that embeds position \ninformation into a texture that periodically varies with the \ndimension index (as shown in Fig. 2). Since different positions \nrepresent different features, adding positional encoding [32] is \nessential for accurate feature modeling. \n𝑃𝐸(𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖) = 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑝𝑜𝑠/ 10000\n2𝑖\n𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 )\n𝑃𝐸(𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖+1) = 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑝𝑜𝑠/ 10000\n2𝑖\n𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 )\n(1) \n \n𝑝𝑜𝑠  is the location of patch, 𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙  is the embedding \ndimension of each patch, 𝑖  is the location of embedding \ndimension. \n \nFIGURE 2. Visualization of sin-cosine positional encoding \nB. DEFORMABLE CONVOLUTION \nThere are limitations to modeling large, unknown shape \ntransformations using traditional CNNs. Since different \nlocations may correspond to objects of various scales or sizes, \nthe convolutional unit's fixed sampling of the input feature \nmap can result in all activation units having the same receptive \nfield. This can potentially hinder the precise localization of \nobjects. To address this issue, deformable convolution is \nintroduced to improve deformation modeling ability . This \nmethod is based on a parallel network that learns offset, \ncausing the convolutional kernel to shift at the sampling points \nof the input feature map, thereby focusing on the region or \ntarget of interest. Fig. 3 illustrates this process.  \n(a) (b)\n \nFIGURE 3. Ordinary convolution and deformable convolution \n \nSpecifically, the traditional Transformer model utilizes 2D \nconvolution for feature extraction, employing large \nconvolutional kernels and strides. This approach is necessary \nbecause, for image data, even smaller kernels and strides \nwould still yield feature maps with sizes reaching tens of \nthousands of pixels. Calculating attention mechanisms for \neach pixel would thus lead to an extremely high computational \ncomplexity. However, the features are considerably smaller \nfor network intrusion detection than for image data. Therefore, \nemploying small strides and convolutional kernels with \ncontinuous sliding windows can adequately extract edge \ninformation, resulting in more reliable model outcomes. \nIn traditional convolution, sampling is done on the regular \ngrid 𝑅 of the input feature map 𝑦, and the sum of weighted \nsampling values by 𝑤. 𝑅 represents the relative coordinates of \neach point in the output feature map, 𝑝0 is a point on feature \nmap y corresponding to the center point of the convolution \nkernel, and 𝑝𝑛  is each offset of 𝑝0  within the convolutional \nkernel range. \n \n𝑅 = {(−1, −1), (−1,0), … , (0,1), (1,1)} (2) \n𝑦(𝑝0) = ∑ 𝑤\n𝑝𝑛∈𝑅\n(𝑝𝑛) ⋅ 𝑥(𝑝0 + 𝑝𝑛) (3) \nDeformable convolution introduces an offset ∆𝑝𝑛 for each \npoint based on traditional convolution, which is generated by \nanother convolution with the input feature map and is usually \na decimal. \n𝑦(𝑝0) = ∑ 𝑤\n𝑝𝑛∈𝑅\n(𝑝𝑛) ⋅ 𝑥(𝑝0 + 𝑝𝑛 + ∆𝑝𝑛) (4) \n \nSince the offset position after addition is not an integer and \ndoes not correspond to the actual pixel points on the feature \nmap, interpolation is needed to obtain the offset pixel value, \nusually using bilinear interpolation, where 𝑝 = 𝑝0 + 𝑝𝑛 +\n∆𝑝𝑛, and 𝑞 enumerates all integral spatial positions in the  \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

SELF ATTENTION \nLet's examine the attention mechanism [30] of the Vision \nTransformer. The input is a flattened feature map 𝑋 ∈ ℝ𝑁×𝐶 , \nand it is processed by a multi -head self-attention (MHSA) \nblock with 𝑀 heads. The MHSA block can be represented as \nfollows: \n \n𝑞 = 𝑥𝑊𝑞, 𝑘 = 𝑥𝑊𝑘, 𝑣 = 𝑥𝑊𝑣 (6) \n𝑧(𝑚) = 𝜎(𝑞(𝑚)𝑘(𝑚)𝑇/ √𝑑)𝑣(𝑚)    𝑚 = 1, … , 𝑀 (7) \n𝑧 =  𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(𝑧(1), 𝑧(2), … , 𝑧(𝑀))𝑊𝑜 (8) \nHere, 𝜎(∙) denotes the softmax function, and 𝑑 =  𝐶/𝑀 \nrepresents the dimension for each head. 𝑧(𝑚) represents the \nembedding output of the m -th attention head, while \n𝑞(𝑚), 𝑘(𝑚), 𝑣(𝑚) ∈ ℝ𝑁×𝑑 represent the query embedding, key \nembedding, and value embedding respectively. The projection \nmatrices 𝑊𝑞 , 𝑊𝑘 , 𝑊𝑣  , 𝑊𝑜 ∈ ℝ𝐶×𝐶  are used in the MHSA \nblock. To introdu ce non-linearity, a Transformer block \ntypically includes an MLP block with two linear \ntransformations and a GELU activation.  \nBy incorporating normalization layers and identity shortcut \nconnections, the 𝑙-th transformer block can be expressed as  \nfollows: \n𝑧𝑙\n′ = 𝑀𝐻𝑆𝐴(𝐿𝑁(𝑧𝑙−1)) + 𝑧𝑙−1 (9) \n𝑧𝑙 = 𝑀𝐿𝑃(𝐿𝑁(𝑧𝑙\n′)) + 𝑧𝑙\n′ (10) \nD. DEFORMABLE ATTENTION \nIn traditional self-attention mechanisms, obtaining the feature \nvector at each position involves the weighted summing of the \nentire feature map. However, in deformable attention \nmechanisms, the feature vector at each position is obtained by \nweighted summing of the feature vectors of adjacent small \nblocks. That can be translated, rotated, scaled, and transformed \nin different directions. This deformable approach enables the \nmodel to better adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes \nand to capture interactions between objects more accurately. \nWhy do traditional attention mechanisms consume more \nmemory and computational costs? One major challenge with \nusing Transformer attention for image feature mapping is that \nit considers all possible spatial positions, leading to \ncomputational inefficiency. To overcome this limitation, a \ndeformable attention mechanism has been proposed as an \nalternative to the traditional attention mechanism. This \napproach draws inspiration from deformable convolution and \nfocuses on a small number of key sampling points around the \nreference point, as illustrated in Fig. 4. By assigning a small \nfixed number of ke ys to each query, not only can the \ncomputational resources of the model be reduced, but also the \nproblems related to convergence and feature space resolution \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

However, the input image is \nflattened into a sequence input.  \nSpecifically, the first step is to determine the number of \nyour sampling points, perform two full connections on the \nfeature map, and determine the offsets and weights relative to \nthe sampling points around the feature points. The weights and \noffsets are random at the beginning; during the model training, \nthe obtained weights and offsets are more and more consistent \nwith the optimization results, focusing on the area of interest \nand ignoring non -correlated areas so that each feature only \ncalculates the relationship between a small number of \nsurrounding feature points, which not only reduces It reduces \ncomputing power and memory, and avoids the impact of \nirrelevant areas on the results. \nThe input feature map 𝑥 ∈ ℝ𝐻×𝑊×𝐶  is given. we use 𝑞 to \nindex a query element with content feature 𝑧𝑞  and a two -\ndimensional reference point 𝑃𝑞 . The deformable attention \nmechanism can be calculated using the following formula: \n𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑛(𝑧𝑝, 𝑝𝑞, 𝑥) =\n∑ 𝑊𝑚\n𝑀\n𝑚=1\n[∑ 𝐴𝑚𝑞𝑘\n𝐾\n𝑘=1\n⋅ 𝑊𝑚\n′ 𝑥(𝑝𝑞 + 𝛥𝑝𝑚𝑞𝑘 )] (11) \n \nIn the equation, we denote the total number of attention \nheads as M and the total number of sampled keys as 𝐾, where \n𝐾 is always less than 𝐻𝑊. Additionally, we use 𝛥𝑝𝑚𝑞𝑘  and \n𝐴𝑚𝑞𝑘 to denote the sampling offsets and attention weights of \nthe m-th attention head and k-th sampled point, respectively. \nThe attention weight 𝐴𝑚𝑞𝑘 ranges from 0 to 1, ∑ 𝐴𝑚𝑞𝑘\n𝐾\n𝑘=1 =\n1 . 𝛥𝑝𝑚𝑞𝑘 ∈ ℝ  is a two -dimensional unconstrained real \nnumber. As 𝑃𝑞 + 𝛥𝑝𝑚𝑞𝑘  is a fractional order, bilinear \ninterpolation is utilized to compute the precise value \nfollowing the offset. 𝛥𝑝𝑚𝑞𝑘  and 𝐴𝑚𝑞𝑘 are both derived from \nlinear projection on the query feature 𝑍𝑞, with 𝑊𝑚 and 𝑊𝑚\n′  \nserving as projection matrices. Specifically, the query feature \n𝑍𝑞  is inputted into a linear projection operator with 3𝑀𝐾 \nchannels. The first 2𝑀𝐾  channels encode the sampling \noffset Δp_mqk, while the remaining 𝑀𝐾  channels are \ndirected to the Softmax operator to obtain the attention \nweight 𝐴𝑚𝑞𝑘.  \nThis is because every sampling point in each attention \nhead possesses 𝐾  sampling keys. Each sampling key \nnecessitates the prediction of horizontal and vertical \ncoordinates for the offset, while the weight solely requires \nthe prediction of a singular value. \nThe procedure entails the addition of offset 𝐴𝑚𝑞𝑘  to the \ntwo-dimensional reference point 𝑃𝑞  to acquire the offset \ncoordinates. The value of this offset is subsequently found in \nfeature map x, based on these coordinates. The offset \ncoordinates are then multiplied by attention weight 𝐴𝑚𝑞𝑘 \nand ultimately output through a fully connected layer.  \nE. LOSS FUNCTION \nTo address the issue of imbalanced intrusion detection \ndatasets, we propose a layered focal loss function, called L -\nFocal loss. firstly, we start with the binary classification \ncross-entropy loss and gradually introduce the L -Focal loss \nfunction.  \nwhere 𝑦 is the label of the sample, and 𝑦′ ∈ [0,1] is the \nestimated probability of the model for the class with label \n𝑦 = 1. 𝑝 is the final probability \n𝑝 = { 𝑦′,             𝑖𝑓 𝑦 = 1,\n1 − 𝑦′,         𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒. (12) \n𝐶𝐸(𝑝, 𝑦) = 𝐶𝐸(𝑝) = − log(𝑝) (13) \n \nIn intrusion detection datasets, there is an imbalance in the \ndifferent categories of data, with normal traffic samples \nbeing much more abundant than other types of attack \nsamples. Negative samples account for the dominant part of \nthe total loss. The model predicts attack traffic as normal \ntraffic to reduce loss and improve accuracy . This makes \nmodel optimization unsatisfactory. This violates our original \nintention, but the L-Focal loss function assigns the weight of \npositive and negative samples in the total loss by varying the \nweight factor α. The weight decreases as the number of \nsamples increases, resulting in a more minor impact on the \nloss function. \n𝐵𝐶𝐸(𝑝, 𝑦, 𝛼) = { −𝛼log (𝑝),            𝑖𝑓 𝑦 = 1,\n−(1 − 𝛼)log (𝑝),    𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒. (14) \n \nWhen too many negative samples are easily distinguished, \nthe entire training revolves around these negative samples, \noverwhelming positive samples and causing significant loss. \nTherefore, we introduce a modulation factor 𝛾 to focus on \ncomplex samples. In the L -Focal loss function, 𝛾 is utilized \nas a modulation factor to amplify the loss of challenging -to-\nclassify samples and reduce the impact of easily classifiable \nsamples on the model. However, entering different \nmodulation factor parameters results in significant \ndifferences in output results, leading to overfitting problems \nwhen there are outliers. \nIt is not uncommon for an intrusion detection model to \nfind rare types of attacks in a dataset [37]. However, directly \nusing (1 − 𝑝)𝛾 as a modulation factor for the loss function \nduring the model training process can lead to continuous loss \nreduction without improving the model's accuracy. This may \nnot be conducive to model development and research. The \nL-Focal loss function, on the oth er hand, classifies samples \ninto different levels of classification, with a focus on \naccurately classifying samples near 𝑝 =  0.5 , rather than \noveremphasizing highly classifiable samples with 𝑝 ≫  0.5 \nor outliers with 𝑝 ≪  0.5. \n𝑔(𝑝) = {(1 − 𝑝)𝛾1 ,          |𝑝 − 0.5| < 𝑎,\n(1 − 𝑝)𝛾2 ,              𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒, (15) \n𝐿𝐹𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 = { −𝛼𝑔(𝑝)log 𝑝,            𝑖𝑓 𝑦 = 1,\n−(1 − 𝛼)𝑔(𝑝)log 𝑝,    𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒. (16) \n \nTo achieve this, the L -Focal loss function introduces a \nmodulation factor, 𝑔(𝑝), and a weighting factor, 𝛼 ∈ [0,1], \nwhile 𝑝 ∈ [0,1] represents the estimated probability of the \nmodel. By setting a value to classify samples in the L -Focal  \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

The recall rate, \nprecision, and accuracy of each data category are listed, and it \ncan be seen that each category has a higher accuracy. Table 8 \ncompares the overall accuracy and category precision of DE-\nVIT with other multi -class algorithms on the CIC IDS2017 \ndataset [33]. The overall accuracy is 6.5% higher than the \nsecond-ranked DBN -KELM [35] and superior  to other \nalgorithms. However, precision and accuracy decrease rapidly \nin categories with relatively few samples. Although we have \ntaken measures to address the imbalance issue in the data and \nachieved fairly good results, it is not perfect and still needs \nfurther improvement. \nV. CONCLUSION \nThis paper presents a cutting -edge approach, DE -VIT, to \naddress the challenge of intrusion detection. By transforming \nintrusion detection data into image data, DE -VIT employs \nimage classification algorithms to resolve the issue effectively. \nThe method refines the original VIT and incorporates a more \nadvanced deformable attention mechanism instead of self -\nattention. An enhanced sliding window mechanism is \nintroduced to optimize the model further for superior edge \ninformation extraction . At the same time,  deformable \nconvolution is utilized to extract edge information and expand \nthe receptive field of each patch. Sine and cosine positional \nencoding are integrated to represent diverse features at varying \npositions. This results  in a texture imbued with position \ninformation as the position embedding changes gradually with \nthe dimension sequence number. \nDE-VIT introduces an innovative deformable attention \nmechanism module that selects the position of key-value pairs \nin a data -dependent manner. This agile solution enables the \ndeformable attention mechanism module to concentrate on \npertinent areas and captu re more information features, \ncircumventing excessive memory and computational costs. To \ntackle the issue of imbalanced datasets, a layered focal loss \nfunction, dubbed the L -Focal loss function, is proposed to \ncenter attention on challenging -to-classify samples, thereby \nenhancing classification accuracy. \nExperimental results demonstrate DE -VIT's superiority \nover other algorithms. In binary classification experiments, we \nattained 99.5% accuracy on the CIC IDS2017 dataset [33] and \n97.25% on the UNSW -NB15 dataset [34], outperforming \nmost mainstream algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, and DBN-\nKELM. Our algorithm surpassed others in multi-classification \nexperiments, achieving commendable accuracy and precision \nacross most categories. The accuracy of small samples did not \nsignificantly decline under the constraint of the loss function, \nculminating in satisfactory experimental results. \nSeveral promising research directions emerge based on the \nDE-VIT approach proposed in this paper. Firstly, exploring its \napplicability in diverse image -based classification tasks \nbeyond intrusion detection, such as medical imaging or \nsatellite analysis, can provide valuable insights into its \nversatility. Additionally, refining the deformable attention \nmechanism for dynamic focus adjustment and incorporating \nreinforcement learning techniques can enhance adaptability. \nExtending the application of the L-Focal loss function beyond \nimbalanced datasets or investigating novel loss functions can \nimprove model robustness.  Moreover, integrating DE -VIT \nwith advanced techniques like graph neural networks or self- \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.
