    "abstract": "Abstract. Wind turbines in a wind farm operate individually to maximize their own performance regardless of the impact of aerodynamic interactions on neighboring turbines. Wind farm controls can be used to increase power production or reduce overall structural loads by properly coordinating turbines. One wind farm control strategy that is addressed in literature is known as wake steering, wherein upstream turbines operate in yaw misaligned conditions to redirect their wakes away from downstream turbines. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO conducted a demonstration of wake steering on a single utility-scale turbine. In this campaign, the turbine was operated at various yaw misalignment setpoints while a lidar mounted on the nacelle scanned five downstream distances. The lidar measurements were combined with turbine data, as well as measurements of the inflow made by a highly instrumented meteorological mast upstream. The full-scale measurements are used to validate controls-oriented tools, including wind turbine wake models, used for wind farm controls and optimization. This paper presents a quantitative comparison of the lidar data and controls-oriented wake models under different atmospheric conditions and turbine operation. The results show good agreement between the lidar data and the models under these different conditions.",
