Lumped parameter elements arose originally in electronics and \nelectrical engineering, to describe the energy storing and dissipation elements of electric \ncircuits.  Generally speaking, lumped parameter modelling can be used to model circuits of \nshort characteristic dimensions compared with the wavelength of operation.  \n \nStandard lumped parameter modelling treats a tokamak as a toroidal transformer with one turn \nsecondary R, L plasma ring circuit coupled with a primary transformer circuit, where R,L \ndenote plasma resistance and inductance respectively.  The presence of non ohmic current is \ntreated using an additional non inductive current source [1],[2]. The coupling between \ntransformer primary and plasma is accounted by a mutual inductance M. This standard \ndescription, despite its simplicity, has proved to be very useful in analysis and prediction of \nplasma discharge evolution.  It has been used for years to infer non inductive current drive \nfractions and efficiencies in tokamaks [3],[4] and also to perform initial estimations of central \nsolenoid magnetic flux in tokamak reactor studies [5] .  However, it does not take into account \nthe variations of plasma inductance that occur during plasma current transients due to the \nslow flux penetration inside the plasma, or skin effect.  This is an important issue for \ntokamaks, particularly during the initiation and termination phases of the discharge, due to the \nlarge machine size and plasma temperature. We have developed an improved transformer \nmodel that includes a lumped parameter formulation for the skin effect, and whose purpose is \nto predict with reasonable accuracy the inductance and current changes as function of the \nexternal PF currents, plasma resistance and current drive. We call this model a skin effect \ntransformer model to differentiate it from the standard transformer model where plasma \ninductance is a fixed parameter. \n \nDistributed parameter simulations are the preferred option to simulate current profile \nevolution and the associated internal inductance changes that occur during plasma current \ntransients [6] - [13]. These distributed parameter simulations predict strong correlations \nbetween internal inductance and plasma current transients, in agreement with the experiments. \nA correlation model is some kind of lumped parameter formulation, in the sense that does not \ncontain explicit information about profiles. Since plasma current can be predicted with a \nlumped parameter model, the correlation observed between internal inductance and plasma \ncurrent transients is evidence suggesting that a lumped parameter formulation could predict \ninternal inductance behaviour. Previous lumped parameter modelling of the JET tokamak has \nproved the feasibility of this approach [14] .  \n \nTo be able to describe the effect that plasma current profile evolution has on the internal \ninductance using the lumped parameter approach, some profile and geometric information \nmust necessarily be embedded (lumped) in the model inputs, parameters and state variables. \nBut the aim the lumped parameter modelling philosophy is not to describe plasma profiles or \ngeometry evolution in itself. For this, distributed parameter models and simulations are \nrequired. There are plenty of such distributed parameter models available [15] - [21] , some of \nthem are control oriented [22] , [23]  and some of them are even available in real time [24] . \nFrom this point of view, lumped parameter models are no substitute for distributed parameter \nmodels. However, when it comes to control systems design, a lumped parameter formulation \nis preferred. Lumped parameter models have been the first modelling choice for tokamak \nmagnetic control for years [25]-[30]  , since control system’s design methodology is well \ndeveloped for lumped parameter systems [31] - [34]. The main motivation for the skin effect \ntransformer model is to be used in the design of tokamak plasma current, boundary flux and \ninductance control systems. An ongoing project at TCV aims to test this type of controls. \nHowever Tokamak magnetic control is not the subject this paper. The reader is referred to \n[35] , [36] and references therein for details of how plasma current and general magnetic \ncontrol systems are designed. The motivation, application and demonstration of inductance \ncontrol are a reported elsewhere in the literature [37]-[42] and not discussed here either. \n \n \nThe paper is organised as follows: \n \nSection II  starts the lumped parameter modelling by identifying some energy storing and \ndissipation elements of the tokamak circuit, along with some useful relationships among them. \nA set of exact coupled differential equations for internal inductance and plasma current are \nderived from energy conservation and power balance theorems.  An additional boundary flux \nconservation theorem provides the link between external coil currents, plasma current and \nboundary flux.  The result is a novel description of the tokamak transformer using only \nlumped parameters, predicting the evolution and non linear interaction of the plasma current \nand internal inductance as functions of the primary coil currents, plasma resistance, non-\ninductive current drive and an additional equilibrium state  derived from the flux linked by the \nplasma current distribution. This lumped parameter formulation does not require information \nabout the plasma profiles spatial distribution. Instead, all the information about the profiles is \nembedded in the state variables and inputs.   \n \nSection III  introduces a simplified model relating the equilibrium state  to the boundary and \nresistive voltages. This is required to close the system of equations obtained in section II . The \nequilibrium state model is a lumped parameter version of the skin effect obtained by replacing \nthe loop voltage profile eigenfunction by a three-dimensional eigenvector.  \n  \nSection  IV  writes the equilibrium state model obtained in section III  as a generic family of  \nstate space models, which is the preferred structure for the analysis of sections VII  and VIII  .  \n \nSection  V  explains the set-up and details of dedicated plasma current modulation experiments \nperformed at the TCV tokamak.   To expose the model non-linearities, the experiments were \nconducted using an extended range of operation both in amplitude and frequency. This differs \nfrom the conventional approach in system identification, where small signal models are \nsought. Some details of the TCV current control system are explained since they are central to \nthe discussion, but this control system is part of earlier developments at TCV, and is not a \ncontribution of this work.  \n \nSection VI  explains how the data required for the analysis is generated with an equilibrium \ncode, and some basic spectral analysis of the resulting inputs and outputs to give an idea of \nthe experiment’s modulation bandwidth. \n \n Section VII  performs a linear system identification analysis to find empirically the \nequilibrium state model order and parameters from the experimental data.   \n \nSection VIII  performs a non linear system identification analysis using the model parameters \nfound in section VII  as an initial guess. A final cross-correlation study between the model \nresiduals and its inputs is used to illustrate the accuracy of the results.  \n \nFinally, section IX  presents a reduced version of the model written in control affine form, so \nit can readily be used for control systems design.  \n \n II. Derivation of exact tokamak transformer lumped parameter equations  \n \nWe are after a lumped parameter formulation for the tokamak transformer not requiring \nexplicit information about plasma profiles spatial distribution, but still being able to describe \nprocesses related to plasma profiles spatial evolution, such as the skin effect. Necessarily, \nsome kind of profile information must be lumped in some states and inputs. This section \nidentifies state variables and inputs that lump the profile information along with basic \nrelationship among them.  These relationships are derived from conservation laws, so the \nresulting model is exact.  \n \nIn the following, both a cylindrical coordinate system \n( ), , r z φ  and a flux coordinate system \nρ,θ,φ( ) are used, and the plasma is assumed to be axisymmetric about the z-axis. Only the \ntime evolving components ( )Zr BB ,  of the poloidal  magnetic field and the toroidal \ncomponents of the electric field E are considered in the analysis.  \n   \nThe region of integration will be defined as the region where there is plasma. This will \ncorrespond to a plasma volume \nG , or a plasma cross section Ω, delimited by the plasma \nboundary Γ . \nThe plasma current is defined as  \n \nI jdS \nΩ\n= ∫            (1) \nwhere  dS drdz =  and  j is the toroidal current density.   \nThe poloidal flux function   ψ r,z( ) is the flux through an arbitrary circle of radius r centred at \nthe torus symmetry axis at a position z.  All the points with equal flux define a flux surface.  \nThe flux surface surrounding the plasma region is the boundary flux surface  ψ B .  \n \nThe Green´s function  for a unit toroidal current ring at r\nj = rj,zj( )satisfies  \nΔ *G r,rj\n \n = 2\nπµ 0rδ r − r1( )δ z− z1( ) \nwhere *Δ  is the elliptic operator \n \n2\n*\n2\n1 1 \nr r r r z \n∂ ∂ ∂   Δ = +   ∂ ∂ ∂   \n         (2) \nThe mutual inductances M j  between the coil system j and the plasma boundary can be \nwritten in terms of Green’s functions as [44] , [45] : \nM j = µ0\n1\n2π G r a( ),rj\n \n\n0\n2π\n∫ dθ         (3) \nSimilarly, the external inductance between the plasma current and the  plasma boundary is  \n           \nLe = −µ0 χ\n0\n2π\n∫ a,θ1( ) G r a( ),r1 a( )\n \ndl\nθ1( )       (4) \nwhere dl θ( ) denotes the differential arclength along the coordinate θ  and  \nχ ρ ,θ( ) = ∇ ρ\nr ∇ ρ\nr dl θ( )\n0\n2π\n∫\n         (5)\n \nPractical numerical details on how to calculate Green’s functions and avoid the singularity at \nr = r1  can be found in  [44] , [45] \n \nUsing the external and mutual inductances, the flux at the plasma boundary Bψ  can be written \nas the sum of the contributions from the PF coil systems and the internal plasma current \ndistribution, according to the boundary flux conservation equation:  \n \n ψ b = LeI + M jIj∑           (6) \n \nThe plasma internal inductance \niL  is defined from the magnetic energy content inside the \nplasma volume G    \n \n( )\n2 2 2 \n0\n1 1 \n2 2 \ni r z \nG\nW L I B B dv µ= = + ∫         (7) \n \nwhere \n0µ  is the vacuum magnetic permeability and the differential volume element is \n \ndv rdrd dz φ=            (8) \n \nThe quantity W contains magnetic energy created by the plasma current as well as by external \nconductors.  \nThe plasma inductance \npL is the sum of the internal and external inductance components. \np e i L L L = +            (9) \n \nAn alternative expression for the magnetic energy (7) as a function of poloidal fluxes at \ncertain locations and the current density is [14]  \n \n( )\n2\nC B IW ψ ψ −=            (10) \n \nand equivalently  \n \n( )i C B L I ψ ψ = − ,          (11) \n \nwhere \nCψ  is defined as \nC\njdS \nI\nψ\nψ Ω=\n∫\n  .         (12) \nThe flux Cψ  is termed equilibrium flux , as it is the sole variable in our treatment that depends \nexplicitly on the details of the plasma equilibrium. Although Cψ is a distribution average, we \ncan formally identify a flux surface inside the plasma on which the flux takes the value Cψ . \nThis flux surface, which may of course move radially in time, will be termed the equilibrium \nflux surface.  \n \nThe Poynting energy theorem in toroidal geometry is written as [1]  \n \nB\ndW jVdS V I dt Ω\n+ = ∫           (13) \n \nor equivalently as \n \ndW\ndt = VB − VR( ) I          (14)  \n \nwhere the loop voltage at the boundary flux surface  is   \n \ndt \ndV B\nB\nψ− =            (15) \n \nand the resistive drop \nRV  is written in terms of the total plasma current, resistance and an \nequivalent non-inductive current ˆI  as \n \n( )ˆ\nRV R I I = −            (16) \n \nThe resistive flux is defined as  \n( )\n0 0 \nˆ\nt t \nR R V dt R I I dt ψ = − = − − ∫ ∫         (17) \n \nAgain, we can formally identify a flux surface inside the plasma on which the flux takes the \nvalue \nψ R . This flux surface, which may of course move radially in time, will be termed the \nresistive flux surface.  \n \nThe ohmic power dissipation from Poynting analysis is given as a volume integral of the \ncurrent density distribution \nj, effective plasma resistivity η , and non-inductive current \ndensity ˆj in the toroidal direction.  \n \nEj dv=\nΩ\n∫ η j− ˆ\nj\n( )j dv\nΩ\n∫ = η j2 dv\nΩ\n∫ − jη ˆ\nj dv\nΩ\n∫         (18) \nThe ohmic power dissipation in the lumped parameter picture is  \nR I − ˆI( )I = RI2 − RIˆI             (19) \nboth descriptions are desired to be the same, so power balance is fulfilled:  \nRI2 − RIˆI = η j2 dv\nΩ\n∫ − jη ˆ\nj dv\nΩ\n∫           (20) \nso the natural choices are  \nRI2 = η j2 dv\nΩ\n∫              (21) \nRIˆI = jη ˆ\nj dv\nΩ\n∫              (22)  \nleading to the following expressions for  plasma resistance R  and current drive ˆI  : \n \nR =\nη j2 dv\nΩ\n∫\nI2            (23) \n \nˆI\nI =\njη ˆ\nj dv\nΩ\n∫\nη j2 dv\nΩ\n∫\n           (24) \n \nThese are the only definitions that make compatible the Poynting  power balance analysis (13) \nwith (14)    \n \nLinear combinations of (14)  and of the time derivative of (11) lead to the following set of \ncoupled equations \n \n( )2i\nR C \ndL I V V dt = −           (25) \n \n2i B C R \ndI L V V V dt = + −           (26) \n \nThe equilibrium voltage at the equilibrium flux surface is derived from Lenz´s law \n \nC\nC\ndV dt \nψ= −            (27) \n \nEquations (25) and (26) determine the evolution of the plasma current and internal inductance \nas functions of boundary size and shape, equilibrium, and resistive voltages.  \n \nThe final steady-state solution for plasma current and inductance corresponds to a constant \nloop voltage profile across the plasma: \n \n \n( , ) \nB R C \nr t V V V t\nψ∂ = = = ∂ .          (28) \n \nThe flux diffusion dynamics is embedded in this model. For instance, a drop in plasma \nresistance at constant boundary voltage will increase the plasma current, which in turn will \nincrease the resistive drop (16). Similarly, an increase in boundary loop voltage will drive \nmore plasma current and the resistive drop will also increase.  \nUsing the flux balance equation (6) and Ohm’s law (16), the dynamic response (25), (26) can \nbe written explicitly as a function of PF coil currents, plasma resistance and non inductive \ncurrent drive: \n \n( )ˆ2 2 eP\nC\ndL dL I R I I V I dt dt = − − +         (29)  \n \n( ) ˆ2\nj j e\nP C j j \ndI dM dL dI L V R I I M I I dt dt dt dt = − − − − − ∑ ∑      (30) \n \nCombination of(6),  (15),  (29),(30) leads to an expression for the boundary voltage as direct \nfunction of the states, inputs and model parameters:  \n    \n( )( ) ˆ2\nj j e i i \nB C j j \nP P P \ndI dM L L L V V R I I M I L L dt L dt = − − − − − ∑ ∑      (31) \n \nThe differential equations (29),(30)  (or alternatively (25) , (26) ,(31) ) predict the exact \nevolution of plasma current and inductance without requiring explicit information about \nplasma profiles spatial distribution. Instead, all the information about the profiles is lumped in \nthe state variables, parameters and inputs. Note that (29),(30) is not yet a closed set of \nequations. Equations (29),(30) depend on the equilibrium state (27), whose dynamics will \ndetermined empirically in later sections using system identification techniques.   \n \nThe plasma is kept within the vacuum vessel boundaries by means of additional plasma shape \nand position control systems acting on the PF coils. When shape and position are kept \napproximately constant, the terms on the right hand side containing time derivatives of mutual \nand external inductances can be neglected, and the set of equations simplifies to \n \n( )ˆ2 2 P\nC\ndL I R I I V dt = − −          (32)  \n \n( ) ˆ2\nj\nP C j \ndI dI L V R I I M dt dt = − − − ∑         (33) \n \nIf in addition the plasma internal inductance is constant in time, a standard transformer \nequation is obtained  \n \n( ) ˆj\nj P \ndI dI M R I I L dt dt − = − + ∑         (34) \n \nThe physical meaning of this equation is that the change of flux produced by the external coils \ngenerates a loop voltage that compensates the resistive drop and builds up the plasma current. \nAccording to (34) , the time constant for inductive current build up is \n \nτp = Lp /R            (35) \n \nwith \nR  and Lp  given by (23) and (9). \n \nIII Lumped parameter model approximation for the skin effect  \n \n \nEquations (29),(30) are exact. They predict the evolution and non-linear interaction of the \nplasma current and internal inductance as functions of the primary coil currents, plasma \nresistance, non-inductive current drive and equilibrium loop voltage.  To obtain a closed set of \nequations, we still have to obtain a model for the equilibrium voltage (27) state dynamics as \nfunction of the remaining system states and inputs of the model.   \n \nWe want to find a lumped parameter version of the flux diffusion equation as function of the \navailable states and inputs alone. The required output of the model is the equilibrium state. To \nbuild the lumped parameter equivalent to flux diffusion equation we have to determine what \nsystem states and inputs are relevant. To do this, we will replace the loop voltage profile \neigenfunction by a three-dimensional eigenvector.  \n \nAt any plasma location, the current density and vector potential are related by Poisson´s \nequation  \n \n2\n0µ = −∇ j A            (36) \n \nWriting the vector potential as a function of poloidal flux, Poisson´s equation can be written \nfor the toroidal component of the current density as \n \n*\n02 rj πµ ψ = −Δ           (37) \n \nwhere \n*Δ  is the elliptic operator (2) .  \n \nUsing Ohm’s law, the voltage at any plasma location, and in particular \nCV , is a solution of  \n \n*\n0\nˆ2V rj η ψ πη µ= − Δ +          (38) \n \n Taking the time derivative of this expression leads to  \n \n( )\n* * \n0\n1 ˆ2V V rj t t t \nη ψ η π η µ\n∂ ∂ ∂   = − Δ + Δ +   ∂ ∂ ∂   \n       (39) \n \nThis distributed parameter equation is exact, but since the flux, resistivity and spatial \ndistribution of non inductive current density are assumed to be unknown, it can not be directly \nincorporated in the model.   \n \nThe simplest form of  (39) corresponds to fixed plasma geometry with time invariant \nresistivity and non inductive current profiles;  \n \n*\n0\nV Vt\nη\nµ\n∂ = Δ ∂            (40) \n \nThus, under these conditions, the time derivative of the loop voltage is proportional to the \nsecond spatial derivative of the loop voltage profile.  \nIf \nR C B ρ ρ ρ < <  are the effective radii of the flux surfaces , , R C B ψ ψ ψ , and the loop voltage \nprofile varies smoothly across the plasma, we can approximate the second order spatial \nderivative by finite differences at neighbouring points around Cρ    \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) B C C R C BR B R \nC\nBC CR BC CR BC CR \nV V V V V V V Vt\nρ\nρ ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ \n− − ∂ Δ∝ − ∝ − + + ∂ Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ     (41) \n \nwhere \n \nBC B C ρ ρ ρ Δ = −  \nCR C R ρ ρ ρ Δ = −           (42) \nBR B R ρ ρ ρ Δ = −  \n \nEquation  (41) has already the shape of a stable first order differential equation for V \nC  in \nwhich the resistive drop and the boundary voltage add up as a compound input to the system.  \nIt also has the required steady state solution (28). The metric (42) is unknown, and is also a \nfunction of time, as the equilibrium evolves. However, despite the numerous unknowns, (41) \nprovides a useful insight into what states and inputs could be used in a linear state space \nmodel. This equation suggests in particular a state space model relating the equilibrium \nvoltage CV  to a linear combination of ,R B V V . We can also infer that, since the metric is \nexpected to evolve in time, a first order structure with fixed coefficients is unlikely to be an \naccurate description, but we will not exclude this possibility from the start.  \n \nIV State space model for equilibrium voltage \n \nFor system identification purposes, we find convenient to write the dynamics of the \nequilibrium voltage (41) as a generic family of state space models of order \nn written in \ninnovations form:  \n \nd rdt \nr\nx = Ax + Bu + K \ny = Cx + \n          (43) \nWhere x is a state space vector, Cy V =  is the output equation and  \n( )\nT\nB R u V V =            (44) \nis the input vector.The residuals r will represent all features present in the output that are not \nexplained by the model. A steady state Kalman [46] matrix K is incorporated to reconstruct \nfrequency response diagrams, including the noise power spectrum, perform residuals \nselfcorrelation (whiteness tests) and input-residuals correlations (independence tests).  This \nwill discussed in detail in later sections.  \nThe model order \nn and the matrices A,B,K can then be determined from experimental data \nusing system identification techniques.  For these techniques to work we need to dynamically \nstimulate the plasma to obtain loop voltage data with broad spectral content. To generate the \nrequired data for the analysis closed loop experiments using random binary signals (RBS) \nimposed as plasma current references have been conducted in the TCV tokamak.  The \npreparation and details of these experiments are discussed in the next section \n \nV System identification experiments \n \nThe ‘Tokamak à Configuration Variable’ TCV is a fusion plasma research facility particularly \nsuited for the study of advanced plasma control systems [47]. It has a major radius of 0.9m, a \ntypical plasma volume of ~1.5 m 3, and a great flexibility of plasma shape configurations. \nTCV has an air core transformer with an available flux swing of 3.4 Webers, Ohmic power \ninput of about 1MW and 4.5 MW of additional Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating \n(ECRH) power. This results in typical plasma discharge duration of 2 seconds and a \nmaximum plasma current up to 1.0 MA, with loop voltage transients up to 10V.   \nOn TCV, the plasma current is made to follow a prescribed waveform by acting on the \nprimary transformer coil voltage. Plasma current feedback is necessary to compensate for the \nchanges in plasma resistance and non inductive current.  For a detailed description of TCV \nhybrid control system the reader is referred to [48]   \n \nIdeally, plasma current feedback control ought to be disabled to test the open loop response of \nthe system. This is however not practical, since without current feedback the plasma current \nundergoes uncontrolled excursions, leading to plasma disruptions in many occasions.  The \nsituation is particularly acute in the extreme modulation conditions of the experiment \ndiscussed later in this section. We are then forced to maintain the plasma current feedback and \nadopt a closed loop system identification approach.  \nFeedback systems introduce correlations between the perturbations in the feedback loop and \nthe inputs. Unmodeled perturbations are treated as noise. When inputs and noise are \ncomparable (as is the case when small signal models are being sought) closed loop system \nidentification is better performed by adding a known perturbation inside the feedback loop \n[[48]  ],[49]. However, the high gain in the TCV current feedback loop implies that any \nperturbations introduced inside the loop (e.g. adding a feed-forward voltage at the ohmic coil, \nas in [49]) are quickly attenuated, so the perturbation technique was not practically \ncompatible with the need to limit the current transients.   \nClosed loop system identification, however, can be successfully performed when the system \nis stimulated with large signals compared with the noise input, and/or a good model for the \nnoise input exists, so noise becomes a modeled perturbation.  We are in fact interested in \nexploring the system’s non-linearity in an extended range of operation both in amplitude and \nfrequency, and the perturbation is largely coming from plasma resistance variations, for which \nwe have a very accurate model at our disposal. This will allow us to use a direct closed loop \nsystem identification approach to extract the relevant open loop dynamic information, in both \nthe frequency and time domains.  \nTo excite high order dynamics of the plasma current / inductance over a broad spectrum, RBS \nwaveforms are imposed as references for the plasma current during the flat top. Plasma \ncurrent was modulated between 200kA and 300kA with 30ms rise time, several times faster \nthan its time constant L \np/R ≈200ms. A feedback control system generates primary transformer \nvoltage control actions to drive the desired plasma current. The plasma current feedback \nsystem has a settling time of less that 8ms, negligible compared with the time constant (35) \nτp ≈ 200ms . The resulting voltage signals for the primary transformer coil and the \ncorresponding responses in primary coil current and plasma current are shown in figures 1 and \n2. The time derivative of the external flux created by the transformer coil and the additional \nPF coil currents create a plasma voltage that for constant plasma and mutual inductances can \nbe approximated by (34). The primary transformer current excitation and the resulting plasma \ncurrent are shown in Fig. 1 for two system identification experiments. A positive current in \nthe toroidal direction flows in the direction of increasing toroidal angle. The sign criteria are \ngiven by Lenz’s and Ohm’s law. A positive voltage applied to the transformer primary \ngenerates a current that increases in time during the discharge. The corresponding boundary \nflux that increases in time will generate negative boundary voltage and negative plasma \ncurrent. \nIp (MA) \n39950 \n-0.2 \n-0.1 \n0\nIOH  (kA) \n-20 \n0\n20 \n39952 \n-0.2 \n-0.1 \n0\n-20 \n0\n20 \ntime(s) \nVOH  (kV) \n0 0.5 1 1.5 2\n-1 \n0\n1\ntime(s) \n0 0.5 1 1.5 2\n-1 \n0\n1\n \nFig. 1.

Then, the \ntransformer current is brought up to positive values to drive negative plasma current. The time \norigin \n0 0t =  is chosen as the time when the poloidal magnetic field null necessary for \nbreakdown is created inside the vacuum vessel.

The data used for \nthe validation is obtained from the equilibrium reconstruction code LIUQE [50] . This code \ndetermines magnetic flux surface distribution from a set of external magnetic measurements \n[51] . Among other plasma variables, LIUQE delivers the plasma current, boundary flux and \nnormalised  internal inductance that are required for the analysis.  Plasma current and internal \ninductance can also be obtained from magnetic probes surrounding the plasma [52]  but we \nprefer to use the LIUQE’s plasma current to obtain a consistent data set. Similar results can \nalso be obtained using transport simulations [53] .The plasma internal inductance is defined \nrelative to the machine major radius ( \n0 0.88 r m = on TCV) and the normalised  internal \ninductance, using  \n \n0 0 \n2\ni\ni\nlL r µ=            (45) \n \nThe resistive voltage is derived from the power balance (14)  as \n \nVR = VB − 1\n2I\nd\ndt LiI2\n( )         (46) \n  \nThe equilibrium flux is derived from (11) as    \n \nC i B L I ψ ψ = +            (47) \n \nBoundary and equilibrium voltages are obtained from (15) and (27) respectively.  \n \nExternal magnetic measurements from flux loops and probes around the vacuum vessel are \nacquired at a 2 kHz sampling rate. The reconstructed equilibrium data for the current analysis \nhas been generated with a 1.5 ms spacing.  \nFigure \n3 shows equilibrium reconstructed data for shot 39952 in a short time window at the \nbeginning of the flat-top .   \n \n0.42 0.44 0.46 0.48 0.5 0.52 0.54 0.56 0.58 0.6 \n-5 \n-4 \n-3 \n-2 \n-1 \n0\n1\n2\ntime(s) \nV\n39952 \n \n \nVr \nVc \nVb \n \nFig. 3.   Evolution of plasma boundary (V B ), equilibrium  (V C ) and resistive (V R ) loop voltages for experiment \n39952. \n \n \nThe resistive drop \nRV  input has a poor stimulation compared with the boundary voltage input \nBV . This makes it difficult to perform a linear system identification analysis using separate \ninputs ,B R V V  and a single cost function based on CV  alone. \n \nA preliminary linear regression analysis (zero order, no dynamics) correlating the output to a \nlinear combination of the inputs \n  u = kVB + (1− k)VR  finds a minimum for 0.5 k ≅ , suggesting \nthat a simplified analysis using a single compound input ( )0.5 B R u V V = +  may be a good \nstarting point.  The model order will be determined from this in the next section.  But first, a \npreliminary inspection of the reconstructed compound inputs ( )0.5 B R u V V = +  and outputs CV  \nis worthwhile. This is shown in figure 4. Simple eye inspection of this figure helps to evaluate \nbandwidth of the system identification experiments. The largest peaks of the voltage \noscillations are spaced about 50-100ms, so the main part of the input signal power is carried \nby low frequency components of less than 20 Hz. The corresponding spectrum estimate is \nshown in figure 5 . The spectral power density of the signals halves above 30 Hz respect to its \nmaximum. Above 70 Hz there is no significant power in inputs or outputs, so it will be very \ndifficult to reconstruct the spectrum (bode diagrams) above this frequency. This will be \nshown in the next section.   \n-6 \n-4 \n-2 \n0\n2\n     \ny (Volts) \n \n \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n-2.5 \n-2 \n-1.5 \n-1 \n-0.5 \nTime(s) \nu (Volts) \n39950 \n39952 \n \nFig. 4.

Both system identification experiments are almost identical in terms of power spectral content. \nMost of the power is concentrated below 70 Hz.  \n \nVII Linear system identification  \n \nNext, we conduct a linear system identification analysis from actual experimental data, to \ndetermine the best order of the model. To do this, the experimental data from a RBS \nstimulated discharge (39950) is used to fit the model parameters using the prediction error \nmethod. The parameters found are then used to predict the behavior of another discharge \n(39952) with an infinite prediction horizon (simulation). Finally, the equilibrium voltage \nsimulation is compared with the actual experiment, and a loss function RN is derived from the \nresidual ε . \n \nε = (ys − yx )            (48) \nRN\n2 = 1\nN (ys − yx )2\ni=1\nN\n∑           (49) \nwhere N is the number of experimental yx and simulated ys data points in the prediction set.  \nThe sample variance of the data set is defined as  \n \nSN\n2 = 1\nN (yx − yx )2\ni=1\nN\n∑           (50) \n \nand the overall fit parameter is defined as  \n \nf = 1− RN\n2\nSN\n2\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n          (51) \n \n The Akaike Information criteria (AIC) and forward prediction error (FPE) are used to \nmeasure the quality of the prediction and best system order [54]. AIC and FPE not only \nreward the goodness of fit, but also include a penalty that is an increasing function of the \nnumber of estimated parameters. According to Akaike's theory, the most accurate model has \nthe smallest AIC and FPE.   \nThe AIC and FPE are defined by the following equations: \n \nAIC = logRN\n2 + 2d\nN + C          (52) \n \nFPE = RN\n2 1+ d\nN\n1− d\nN\n\n\n\n\n          (53) \n \nwhere d is the number of estimated parameters, and C is a constant that that be ignored in \nmodel comparisons [54].  \n \nFigure 7 shows the simulation results for models up to seventh order. \n-6 \n-5 \n-4 \n-3 \n-2 \n-1 \n0\n1\n2\n3\nVc ( V) \nExperimental and simulated model output \n \n \n1st \n2nd \n3rd \n39952 \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n-6 \n-4 \n-2 \n0\n2\nTime \nVc ( V) \n \n \n39952 \n4rth \n5th \n6th \n7th \n \nFig. 6.   Experimental data for RBS stimuli on TCV and simulated model output for linear models up to 7 th  order.  \n  \n \nThe fit parameter for the first order model (red trace) is 1.5%. Clearly, a first order system \n(red trace) is not sufficient to describe the dynamics. This supports our initial insight, \nstemming from the observation that the metric of (41) evolves in time along with the loop \nvoltage profile.   \n Generally speaking, the higher the order the lower the loss function will be, at the expense of \nintroducing a larger number of parameters in the model. Despite the good visual agreement of \nmost models of fig. \n6, the fit parameter (51) for the second order system simulation is just \n25%. This is explained by the small scale noise content features in the identification data set, \nwhich are difficult to appreciate in the figure.  \n \n \n Figure \n7 shows a comparison of  models up to seventh order. An exponential function of the \nAIC and a square root of the FPE are plotted so the result expressed in volts can be directly \ncompared with the loss function. The AIC and FPE criteria are dominated by the loss function \nhaving a minimum for a second order system.

An exponential function of the AIC and a \nsquare root of the FPE are plotted so the result expressed in volts can be directly compared \nwith the loss function. The AIC and FPE criteria are dominated by the loss function R N  \nhaving a minimum for a second order system. The loss function for this case is about 60 mV. \n \n \nNext we evaluate the impulse response of the system using a non-parametric model [54] \nderived from the experimental data using correlation analysis.  Because nonparametric and \nparametric models are derived using different algorithms, agreement between these models \nincreases confidence in the parametric model results. The corresponding transient plots \nprovide also valuable insight into the characteristics of model dynamics, such as natural \nresonances or settling time. We consider the simplest, discrete-time model to estimate the \ndependence of current and past output values subject to noise in the system. We estimate a \nhigh order (n=1 , m=70 ) autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model [54] ,[55],[56] with the \nstructure:  \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )0 1 0 1 ... ... n m a y t a y t T a y t n T b y t b y t T b y t m T e t + − + + − = + − + + − +     (54)  \n \nA small negative lag is introduced in the correlation to investigate any residual feedback \neffects in the input-output data. Then we use this high order model to simulate the system’s \nimpulse response.  Finally, the parametric models up to seventh order are compared with the \ncorrelation model response. Figures \n8 and 9 show the results. The first order model is the \nworst performer. The second order approximation seems closer to the under-damped behavior \nand natural frequency (about 30Hz) shown by the correlation model.  \n \n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.1 \n0\n500 \n1000 \n1500 \n2000 \n2500 \n3000 \nTime (s) \nVc ( V) \nImpulse Response \n \n \nExp \n1st \n2nd \n3rd \n \nFig. 8.

The results of this analysis are shown in \nFig. 10  for \nmodels up to order 3.  The correlation windows are extended over one characteristic response \ntime of the system (35), the order of 200 ms. The first order system is the worst performer in \nthis set. Second, third and higher orders (not shown) pass the whiteness test, but only the third \norder passes the correlation test, followed marginally by the second order model.  \n \nFig. 10.  Whiteness and independence tests for models up to third order.  Self correlation of residuals (top) and \ncross correlation between input and residuals (bottom) are shown for up to 75 lags (112.5 ms). The discontinuous \nlines bound the range that has a 99% probability of being statistically insignificant. \n \nFigure \n11  shows a comparison between the model and experimental data frequency responses. \nThe experimental frequency response is not well determined above 50Hz, particularly in \nphase, due to the low signal to noise ratio at these frequencies. This can be appreciated in \nfigure 5, where it can be observed than the spectral power density of the input signals halves \nabove 30 Hz respect to its maximum. The first order system response is completely \ninadequate, whereas the second order response seems again to be closer to experimental \nresults, exhibiting a resonance frequency around 30 Hz. The second order system with two \npoles and one zero is consistent with the experimental data, despite the noise present. The \n45°/decade rise of the zero is arrested by the overlapping of the two poles, each contributing \nwith a 45°/decade drop in the limited range of frequencies where all are active contributors to \nthe phase. \n \n10 \n-1 \n10 \n0\n10 \n1\nAmplitude \nFrequency response \n10 \n0\n10 \n1\n10 \n2-100 \n-50 \n0\n50 \n100 \nFrequency (Hz) \nPhase (deg) \n \n \nExp \n1st \n2nd \n3rd \n \nFig. 11.

The steady \nstate gain found (k=0.9) is also quite close to what we expect in steady state (k=1). But we \ndon’t trust the damping factor found, for the following physical reasons.  \n The damping factor is  0.3 δ =  , allowing resonant natural oscillations on the equilibrium \nloop voltage even when the system is not driven by an external source. This resonant \nbehaviour requires at least two forms of energy accumulation in the system that can mutually \nbe exchanged. In an electric circuit these are the energy stored in the electric fields (e.g \ncapacitors) , and the energy stored in magnetic field (e.g. inductors). In our problem the \nenergy stored in the poloidal magnetic field is about 20 KJ, and the energy stored in the \ntoroidal electric field (<1V/m) is negligible compared with it (<10 -11  J) . The time variations \nof toroidal electric field are associated to the displacement current. At frequencies below the \nGHz range these can be neglected in the tokamak analysis. Therefore, if the toroidal electric \nfield was responsible for the effect, resonant behaviour should be observed at frequencies \nabove the GHz range, not in the sub-kHz range as we observe. Another possibility is the \ncoupling with the radial electric fields through the return current [57]. In this case the radial \nelectric fields are the order of kV, but again the energy contribution is again too small (<10 -8J) \ncompared with the magnetic energy. Yet one more form of energy accumulation is kinetic in \nnature. During the experiments, plasma radial excursions take place as a response to the \ninternal current redistribution. In this experiments this can take place at maximum speeds of \n0.5 m/s. This gives a plasma kinetic energy term [28] which is again negligible (<10 -7 J) \ncompared with the energy stored in the magnetic field, so it could not be responsible for the \nresonance found.  None of the above forms of secondary energy accumulation can explain the \nresonant behaviour in the sub-kHz range. We should have obtained instead a damping factor \nlarger than one, corresponding with a damped system δ ≥ 1  with two real poles ( two time \nscale dynamics ), which does not allow oscillations unless the system driven by an external \nsource.  \n \nWe believe the observed resonant behaviour may be due to artefacts introduced by the \nequilibrium reconstruction, or perhaps due to the fact that we have used a single compound \ninput for the analysis. There are also inputs to the system that have been assumed to be small \nand have not been modelled in the equilibrium voltage dynamics either, like bootstrap current. \nThere are also conceivable uncertainties in the equilibrium reconstruction that are not \nconsidered, besides of course, all features that can not be explained due to the limitations of \nthe lumped parameter approximation. All these factors are considered to be small contributors, \nand are included in the model as small perturbations or noise, which are accounted by means \nof the Kalman noise model structure of  (43). The noise spectrum of these is presented in \nfigure \n12  exhibiting a maximum that suspiciously coincides with the found system resonance \n(27Hz). Compared with its maximum values (see figure 5), the input and output signals at the \nresonance have about four times less power, translating in about 16 times less signal \namplitude. So another possibility is that the relative contribution from the true system \ndynamics and noise are difficult to resolve by the linear system identification, due to the small \nsignal to noise ratios at this frequency range. To obtain more accurate parameters we will \nhave to resort no non-linear system identification techniques. \n \n10 \n0\n10 \n1\n10 \n210 \n-14 \n10 \n-12 \n10 \n-10 \n10 \n-8 \n10 \n-6 \n10 \n-4 \n10 \n-2 \n10 \n0\nFrequency (Hz) \nPower Spectrum of y(s)=H(s)r(s) \n \n \n1st \n2nd \n3rd \nExp \n \nFig. 12.  Noise power spectrum for experimental data (in black)  and linear models up to third order (in colour).  \n \n \n \nVIII Non linear system identification  \n \nIn this section we are going to exploit the full non-linear model to identify the parameters of \nthe equilibrium voltage model more accurately. We will build a cost function based on the \ntriplet \n, , i C L I V  and exploit the constraints imposed by the model’s non-linear dependencies.   \nWe start by using separate inputs ,B R V V  and restrict the state space model to a second order \nstructure without steady state Kalman gain. To be able to determine the most appropriate set \nof initial conditions, the second order approximation for equilibrium loop voltage dynamics \nthat was found in the previous section is written in canonical observable form as  \n      \n( )\n( )\n1 1 2\n2\n2 2 \n1\n12 1 \n10\nB R B\nR\nkT k T x x V \nk k x x V \ny x \nδω ωω\n−  −        = +           −−          \n=\nɺ\nɺ       (58) \nand  ω ,δ are the natural frequency in radians per second δ  damping factor. The variables \nhave been scaled to the natural frequency so that the model parameters are all roughly of the \nsame magnitude.   \nWritten in this way, the corresponding transfer functions are  \n \n( ) ( )\n( )\n( )\n2\n2 2 \n1\n2\nC B \nB\nB\nV s k T s G s V s s s \nω\nδω ω \n+= = + +         (59) \n \n( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) ( )\n2\n2 2 \n1 1 \n2\nC R \nR\nR\nV s k T s G s V s s s \nω\nδω ω \n− + = = + +         (60) \n \nThe difference with the model found in the previous section is that now we will allow \nseparate inputs for boundary and resistive voltages. Choosing a relative weight \n1k ≤  for BV , \nand a relative weight ( )1 k−  for the RV  input, the steady state solution of (58) is automatically \nguaranteed to match the steady state solution (28).   \nThe weight k  regulates the relative contributions from boundary and resistive voltages to the \nequilibrium voltage. For instance, if k = 0.5  both inputs account for an equal 50% \ncontribution.  This weight should be approximately in inverse relationship with the relative \nproximity of the equilibrium and boundary flux surfaces, according to (41).  \nThe natural frequency ω and damping factor δ are a generalization of a “two time scale” \nmodel, which allows for resonant behavior when the damping factor is less than one. This \nallows us to explore new physics such as the existence of a plasma capacitance that could give \nresonant behavior on the loop voltage at high frequencies. As it was discussed in the previous \nsection, this type of resonant behavior should not be observed at the sub-kHz range, but the \nlinear system identification of the previous section has given some importance to this \npossibility, so we should retain it. When the damping factor is greater than one, the system \nhas two real poles, and a typical “ two time scale dynamics ” is recovered. Regardless of the \ndamping factor value, the natural frequency should scale in inverse relationship with the \nplasma temperature, just like the skin time scales in direct relationship with temperature. \nThe factors TB ,TR , account for fast events in the high frequency end of the spectrum, so the \nequilibrium loop voltage knows about high frequency changes at the boundary or resistive \nvoltages at faster rates than the resistive time scale. This accounts for processes like fast \nmagnetic reconnection, turbulence, helicity transport [58]  etc \n \nTo find the model parameters, the linear diffusion model (58) is combined with the non linear \nequations (16),  (25)and (26) to form a closed set of equations.  The input \nRV  to the linear \ndiffusion model (58)  has now become a non linear function of  the plasma current,  plasma \nresistance and current drive, according to (16). Equations (16),(25), (26) , (58)   are then \nevolved in time starting from given initial conditions. The simulation results for both \nexperiments (39950 and 39952) are finally compared with the observed data and a cost \nfunction is built as a weighted sum of the least squares prediction errors. A gradient descent \nalgorithm is used to find the model parameters for which the cost function has a minimum. \nSince the system has outputs measured in many different units at different magnitudes, volt, \nµH and MA, the weighting function is chosen as the inverse of the data sample variance (50) \nto regularize the units and avoid excessive weighting on some of the outputs. As with any \nnonlinear optimization algorithm, there is a chance that the model might find a local minimum \nthat is not accurate. To help the non linear optimization process, an initial guess for the model \nparameters obtained from the linear system identification analysis presented earlier is used.   \n \nThe results from this non-linear optimization are shown in figure \n13  (red traces), and the \ncorresponding parameters are summarised in table 2.   \n \n \n \nFig. 13.  Comparison between second order model simulations with an under-damped model (red) and damped \nmodel (blue).  Both models produce similar results with different sets of parameters. This is an indication of a \nflat cost function vs. the model parameters, with broad minima.  \n \n \n \nShots \nω ( σ) δ ( σ) BT  ( σ)  RT  ( σ ) k  ( σ) \n39950-52 256  (1) 0.38 (0.01)  0.021 (0.001) 0 (1e-5) 0.67 (0.01) \nTable 2 . Non linear system identification using linear (V C ) and non linear (I, L i) outputs in the objective cost \nfunction. The parameters are found for a generic second order model. The set of parameters is valid for the two \nshots shown.  \n \nThe parameters found using the non-linear optimization correspond again with an under-\ndamped model. We would like to exclude this result because, as mentioned earlier, resonant \nbehaviour cannot physically exist in the sub-kHz range.  So we perform a final check \nrestricting the damping factor to be \n1δ ≥  in the optimization process. Both shots are \nidentified separately both to increase the agreement with experimental data and to check \nparameter value dispersion. The simulation results with the optimized parameters (blue traces) \nare shown in figure 13  The parameters found for the two shots along with their standard \ndeviation are given in table 3.  \n \n \nShot ω ( σ)  δ ( σ) BT  ( σ)  RT  ( σ ) k  ( σ) \n39950 439  (3) 1 (0.04)  0.027 (0.001) 0 (1e-5) 0.6  (0.01) \n39952 440 (4)  1  (0.05) 0.028 (0.001) 0 (1e-5) 0.5  (0.01) \n \nTable 3 Non linear system identification using linear (V \nC ) and non linear (I, L i) outputs in the objective cost \nfunction. The parameters are found for a damped second order model .  \n \nLooking at the results of figure 13 , it seems the damped models of Table 3 (blue traces) are \nalso compatible with the experimental results (black traces), with small differences with \nrespect the under damped model of Table 2 (red traces). The overall fit parameters for plasma \ninductance (38%), current (70%) and equilibrium voltage (30%) are almost identical for both \nthe damped and the under damped models. This evidences a flat cost function vs. the model \nparameters, with broad minima.  \n We may inquire whether the low fit parameters obtained, particularly in the inductance and \nequilibrium voltage, are the result of small scale noise or represent a more fundamental failure \nto describe the dynamics. To this end, we will perform a correlation analysis between the \nmodel residuals and inputs. If the unexplained residuals correlate with the inputs, there are \nfeatures in the outputs that can still be related to the inputs, and therefore these are \nunexplained features not reproduced by the model. If the correlation levels are below the \nconfidence intervals, the discrepancy can be safely attributed to noise, and this would mean \nthat we have reached the best possible model that can be extracted from the given data.  The \nresults can be found in figure \n14 .  The cross correlation between the inputs and residuals for \nequilibrium voltage lay outside the 99% confidence intervals (dotted lines). There are features \nin the equilibrium voltage that correlate with inputs, and therefore are not explained by the \nequilibrium voltage model.  \n \n-0.5 \n0\n0.5 \nIp\n-0.5 \n0\n0.5 \nLi\nRp \n-75 -50 -25 0 25 50 75 -0.2 \n-0.1 \n0\n0.1 \n0.2 \nlag (samples) \nVc\n-75 -50 -25 0 25 50 75 -0.2 \n-0.1 \n0\n0.1 \n0.2 \nlag (samples) \n-0.5 \n0\n0.5 \n-0.5 \n0\n0.5 \nVp\n \nFig. 14.  Correlation function table. The left-hand column shows the correlation functions between the plasma \nresistance input and the residuals from plasma inductance, current and equilibrium voltage. The right-hand \ncolumn shows the correlation functions between boundary loop voltage and the residuals from plasma \ninductance, current and equilibrium voltage. The analysis is performed up to ±75 lags ( ±112ms). The \ndiscontinuous lines bound the range that has a 99% probability of being statistically insignificant.  \n \nWe have no uncertainty information in the equilibrium reconstructed data, so we can not be \nsure about the accuracy of the second order model parameters found. Quite likely different \nequilibrium reconstruction methods could give different order and model parameters. \nNevertheless, the lumped parameter model presented explains the most salient features of the \nplasma current transients, such as the inverse correlation between plasma current ramp rates \nand internal inductance changes, without explicit or detailed knowledge about current \ndistribution, resistivity or loop voltage profiles. This proves that explicit or detailed \nknowledge of plasma profiles is not necessarily required to predict the time evolution of bulk \nplasma properties such as plasma inductance or current with reasonable accuracy; at least in \nOhmic conditions without external heating and current drive sources. The reason for this is \nthe smoothness of the loop voltage profile under these conditions. The skin effect transformer \nmodel provides a good balance between model accuracy and simplicity in this case. \n \nIX Reduced model in control affine form  \n \nWe consider the case of interest where plasma resistance and non inductive current are model \nparameters or perturbations, and the only actuators available are the currents in the OH coil \nand PF systems.  We define the system input, output and state vectors as  \n( )\nT\ni R C C x L I V ψ ψ = −          (61) \n( )iy L I =              (62) \nj j \nj\nu M I = ∑ ɺ            (63) \nAny combination of states can be made available in the output equation (62). In this example \nplasma current and internal inductance are chosen. \n \nWhen the currents in the PF coil system are devoted to regulation of plasma shape and \nposition, the plasma external and mutual inductances are stationary in time. The dynamics \ninternal inductance (32), plasma current (33), flux and equilibrium loop voltage (58) can then \nbe written in state space form as  \n \n( ) ( )\n( )\nx f x g x u \ny h x \n= + \n=\nɺ\n          (64) \n \n( )\n( )( )\n( )( )\n( )( )\n( )( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n2 4 \n2\n4 2 \n1\n2 4 \n2 2 \n3 1 2 2 1 4 1 \nˆ2\nˆ2\nˆ\nˆ1\ne\nR x I x \nx\nx R x I \nf x L x \nR x I x \nk x kx x R x I x x x ω ω α β \n  − −   \n  \n  \n  − − \n  =  + \n  \n− − −   \n  \n  − + − − −   \n     (65) \n( ) ( )\n( )\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n21\n22\ne B \nR\ne\ne B \ne\nL T k x T k L x \nL T k x L x \nα\nωβ δω \n  = − −   +  \n  = +   +  \n        (66) \n \n2\n1\n1 1 \n1( ) 0 0 \nT\nB\ne e \nk T x g x L x L x \nω  −−=   + +   \n        (67) \n \n( )1 2 ( ) h x x x =           (68) \nThe system can be trivially augmented with additional state equations to obtain additional \nvariables or interest.

Exact \nexpressions for these and fundamental relationships among them have been derived from \nbasic electromagnetic theory.   \n \nThe model has an exact mathematical structure built from energy and flux conservation \ntheorems, predicting the evolution and non linear interaction of the plasma current and \ninternal inductance as functions of the primary coil currents, plasma resistance, non-inductive \ncurrent drive and the loop voltage at a specific location inside the plasma termed the \nequilibrium loop voltage.   \n \nLoop voltage profile in the plasma is substituted by a three-point discretization, and ordinary \ndifferential equations are used to predict the equilibrium loop voltage as function of the \nboundary and resistive loop voltages. This provides a simplified model for equilibrium loop \nvoltage evolution, which is reminiscent of the skin effect.  A systematic procedure has been \napplied to find the order this differential equation and its parameters in terms of objective cost \nfunctions, quantitative information criteria, frequency response, and residuals \nwhiteness/correlation tests. \n \nFast plasma current modulation experiments with Random Binary Signals (RBS) have been \nconducted in the TCV tokamak to generate the required data for the analysis.  Plasma current \nwas modulated in Ohmic conditions between 200kA and 300kA with 30ms rise time, several \ntimes faster than its time constant L \np/R ≈200ms.  \n \nA second order differential equation has been found to be the best approximation for \nequilibrium loop voltage model.  When the equilibrium voltage model is combined with the \nenergy and flux preserving equations, the resulting non linear model is capable to describe the \nplasma current and internal inductance time evolution with 70% and 38% accuracy under \nthese modulation conditions. The skin effect transformer model explains the most salient \nfeatures of the plasma current transients, such as the inverse correlation between plasma \ncurrent ramp rates and internal inductance changes. This proves that explicit or detailed \nknowledge of plasma profiles is not necessarily required to predict the time evolution of bulk \nplasma properties such as plasma inductance or current with reasonable accuracy; at least in \nOhmic conditions without external heating and current drive sources. The reason for this is \nthe smoothness of the loop voltage profile under these conditions. The skin effect transformer \nmodel provides a good balance between model accuracy and simplicity in this case.   \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work has been supported by the Euratom mobility programme, the EU FP7 EFDA under \nthe task WP09-DIA-02-01 WP III-2-c, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the University \nof the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) through Research Project GIU11/02, and the Spanish \nMinistry of Science and Innovation (MICINN) through Research Project ENE2010-18345. \nThe authors acknowledge interesting discussions with J.
