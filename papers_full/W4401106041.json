  "abstract": "Social isolation and loneliness pose significant challenges to individual well-being and public health. Conversational AI agents have emerged as a promising tool for addressing social isolation by providing personalized support and companionship to isolated individuals. This study aims to investigate the role of conversational AI agents in providing support and social care for isolated individuals. It seeks to understand the effectiveness of these agents in mitigating loneliness, enhancing social connectedness, and improving overall well-being. While previous research has explored the use of technology for combating social isolation, this study focuses specifically on conversational AI agents and their unique capabilities in delivering personalized and empathetic support to isolated individuals. The research framework encompasses a mixed methods approach, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the experiences and perceptions of isolated individuals interacting with conversational AI agents. Preliminary findings suggest that conversational AI agents hold promise in providing meaningful support and companionship to isolated individuals. Qualitative analysis reveals themes related to the perceived usefulness, ease of use, and emotional connection facilitated by these agents. Quantitative analysis indicates correlations between factors such as age, gender, and the effectiveness of conversational AI agents in addressing social isolation. This study underscores the potential of conversational AI agents in alleviating social isolation and loneliness among isolated individuals. These agents assist in improving general well-being and social connectivity by offering individualized assistance and companionship. The findings guide academics, practitioners, and policymakers who want to use technology to combat social isolation and enhance mental health outcomes.",
