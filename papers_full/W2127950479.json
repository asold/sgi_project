Models with detailed neuronal\nmorphologies, Hodgkin-Huxley type voltage-gated membrane\nconductances, and phenomenological synaptic inputs have been\nused to explore the determinates of action potential firing patterns\nand information processing in single neurons [1–10]. This\ncompartmental neuronal modeling approach [11], which arose\nfrom the pioneering work of Rall [12], has also been used to\ninvestigate the cellular basis of network behavior in various brain\nregions in both health and disease. This includes investigation of\nsynchronous activity [13,14], oscillations [15–17], sensory repre-\nsentation [18,19], locomotion [20] and memory [21] together with\nthe causes of epileptiform activity [15,22,23]. Unfortunately, the\ndiverse software that has been used to construct these models\ntogether with their specialized nature has restricted the wider use\nof such models within neuroscience.\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 1 June 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e1000815\nA number of dedicated software packages are available for\ncreating and simulating neuronal and network models [24]\nincluding NEURON [25], GENESIS [26], MOOSE [27], NEST\n[28] and PSICS (http://www.psics.org). While dedicated simula-\ntors aid the creation of complex models, the multitude of simulator\nspecific programming languages restricts accessibility. Moreover,\nreproducing a model based on the detailed description in the\nassociated paper is often difficult. This splintering of the available\ntechnology has also hindered the sharing and reuse of model\ncomponents and the development of new tools for detailed\ncomputational modeling. This situation contrasts with the field of\nsystems biology [29] which has benefited from the emergence of\nExtensible Markup Language (XML) based standards for\ndescribing biochemical network interactions (e.g. SBML [30],\nCellML [31]) and curated databases of models [32], allowing\ngreater interoperability and validation of model behavior across\nmultiple simulators. For this reason, model sharing together with\ngreater accessibility and interoperability of neuronal models have\nbeen identified as key areas of focus by several recent reports on\nneuroinformatics [33–35]. However, the task of developing\nsimulator-independent standards for describing the myriad of\nmechanisms and anatomical structures in the brain is considerably\nmore complex than formalizing reaction schemes in systems\nbiology.\nThe concept of a Neural Open Markup Language (NeuroML,\nhttp://www.neuroml.org) for neuronal model description was first\nproposed by Goddard et al. [36], who extended previous work by\nGardner et al. [37]. Building on the ideas in this initial work, we\nhave designed, developed and implemented a structure for\nNeuroML that can describe models of neuronal systems at various\nscales in a simulator independent manner. Models of neuronal\nsystems can vary greatly in the amount of biological detail\nincorporated [6]. The latest version of NeuroML (v1.8.1) focuses\non expressing detailed neuronal models which can include\ncomplex neuronal morphologies [38], descriptions of voltage-\nand ligand-gated conductances, synaptic mechanisms and the\npositions of cells and synaptic connections in a 3D network\nstructure. Here we provide an overview of the structure of the\nlanguage, illustrate its functionality by expressing a number of\ncomplex cell and network models in NeuroML and demonstrate\nthe interoperability and model portability it enables by reproduc-\ning model behavior on multiple independently developed\nsimulators.\nResults\nStructure of NeuroML language and technologies used\nThe three Level structure of NeuroML partitions model\ndescriptions into the anatomical structure and the various\nphysiological mechanisms that underlie the electrical behavior of\nneurons and networks and reflects the manner in which they are\ncommonly implemented in neuronal simulators (Figure 1). Level 1\nof NeuroML allows description of the neuronal morphology (in\nMorphML [38]) and relevant background data (metadata)\nassociated with the model. Level 2 of NeuroML builds on this in\ntwo ways: it can be used to extend Level 1 cell descriptions to\ninclude passive and active electrical properties and it includes\nChannelML, which describes voltage-gated membrane conduc-\ntances together with static and plastic synaptic conductance\nprocesses. Descriptions of neural networks are specified in Level 3.\nThis Level includes NetworkML, which specifies the 3D locations\nof neurons, connections between populations, and external\nelectrical inputs. This modular structure, together with the use\nof distinct schemas (i.e. MorphML, ChannelML and NetworkML)\nis designed to enable the exchange and reuse of the individual\ncomponents between a wide variety of software applications.\nDescriptions in higher Levels of NeuroML can build on\ncomponents from lower Levels (Figure 1, Materials and Methods).\nA full description of the model elements and the files used to\nspecify them is provided in Supporting Text S1.\nTo achieve a high degree of biological detail, data-driven\ncompartmental models utilize data from neuronal reconstructions,\nmeasured properties of membrane and synaptic conductances,\nsingle and multiple cell electrophysiological recordings and density\nand connectivity data. The relationship between each of these data\ntypes and the various Levels and modular components of\nNeuroML is illustrated in Figure 2. Models in NeuroML format\ncan be directly imported into applications or automatically\nmapped onto them using a metasimulator (e.g. neuroConstruct\n[39]) and simulation results can be used to make predictions that\ncan be tested experimentally.\nNeuroML is an Open Source project (http://sourceforge.net/\nprojects/neuroml) and the specifications are based on XML [40],\na widely used language for exchanging structured information\nbetween computer applications, which has been used previously in\nother standardization initiatives e.g. SBML [30], CellML [31],\nBrainML [41] and MathML [42]. Figure 3 shows an example of a\nChannelML file with the set of parameters required to fully\ndescribe an instance of a voltage-gated K\n+ channel in the\nHodgkin-Huxley formalism (See Supporting Text S1 for a\ndescription of the current and conductance which would result\nfrom this type of channel model). This XML document is a text\nfile containing structured data (Figure 3A), which can be parsed\nwith freely available software libraries (i.e. with minimal effort for\napplication developers) and can be easily transformed into a\nhuman-readable form (Figure 3B, Materials and Methods).\nMoreover, the properties of the specified model can be readily\nvisualized in graphical form (Figure 3C).\nRather than requiring the restructuring of neuronal simulators\nto a common internal model based on NeuroML, our approach to\nenhance interoperability and transparency identifies the useful\nelements that can be exchanged between computational neuro-\nAuthor Summary\nComputer modeling is becoming an increasingly valuable\ntool in the study of the complex interactions underlying\nthe behavior of the brain. Software applications have been\ndeveloped which make it easier to create models of neural\nnetworks as well as detailed models which replicate the\nelectrical activity of individual neurons. The code formats\nused by each of these applications are generally incom-\npatible however, making it difficult to exchange models\nand ideas between researchers. Here we present the\nstructure of a neuronal model description language,\nNeuroML. This provides a way to express these complex\nmodels in a common format based on the underlying\nphysiology, allowing them to be mapped to multiple\napplications. We have tested this language by converting\npublished neuronal models to NeuroML format and\ncomparing their behavior on a number of commonly used\nsimulators. Creating a common, accessible model descrip-\ntion format will expose more of the model details to the\nwider neuroscience community, thus increasing their\nquality and reliability, as for other Open Source software.\nNeuroML will also allow a greater ‘‘ecosystem’’ of tools to\nbe developed for building, simulating and analyzing these\ncomplex neuronal systems.\nThe NeuroML Model Description Language\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 2 June 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e1000815\nscience tools (morphologies, channels, synapses, network structure\netc.) and develops the means to import and export these in a\nstandardized format. This approach allows researchers to develop\nnew neuronal and network models using the application of their\nchoice for maximum flexibility, and then convert these models to\nNeuroML format for cross simulator validation, increased\naccessibility and storage. This also means that the models are\nrun using a simulator’s own internal data structures, so there is no\nloss of execution performance compared to creating the models\nfrom scratch in the simulator’s own script.\nNeuroML differs from the model description approaches taken\nby SBML and CellML, which can describe a variety of models of\ndynamical systems in biology using low level concepts such as\ncompartments, variables and reaction rates. In contrast NeuroML\nincorporates many higher level concepts such as Hodgkin-Huxley\nmodels of ion channels, synaptic conductance waveforms, synaptic\nplasticity models, 3D dendritic and axonal structures and 3D\nnetwork connectivity, because the neuronal models it describes\ncover many levels of description from ion channels to whole\nnetworks. Indeed it is intended for describing models containing\nthe established neurophysiological entities most commonly used\nwhen modeling biologically detailed neural systems. While this\nlimits the scope of biological models that can be expressed in this\nformat, it ensures that a wide range of detailed neuronal models in\nuse today can be specified in a dedicated language and facilitates\nmapping of the models to widely used simulation tools.\nThe modular nature of the NeuroML language allows modelers\nto use only the components relevant for their system. This is\nenabled by using a number of XML Schema (XSD) files (see\nMaterials and Methods) for each part of the language. The\nstructure of the elements used to specify each component of the\nlanguage is depicted in Figures 4–6. In the following sections we\ndiscuss each of the 3 Levels in more detail.\nNeuroML Level 1\nThe first Level of the NeuroML language has two main purposes:\nto define neuronal morphologies (MorphML) and metadata, which\nprovides additional information about model components at this\nand subsequent levels. Cells are described by lists ofsegment elements,\nwith each element containing the 3D location and shape of each\nsegment. Details of the mapping between elements in MorphML\nand the data structures of other applications that use morphology\nformats such as Neurolucida, NEURON and GENESIS have\npreviously been described [38], and the elements permitted for a cell\ndescription at this and subsequent Levels is shown in Figure 4 (a\ndetailed description of each of these elements is given in Supporting\nText S1). Manual reconstruction of complex neuronal morpholo-\ngies is a difficult and time consuming task and human errors can be\ndifficult to detect. Once converted to MorphML, the morphology\nfiles can be automatically checked for discontinuities and isolated\nelements. MorphML also allows description of other anatomical\ninformation, which may have been recorded during cell recon-\nstruction, such as histological features, reference points, and outlines\nof perceived boundaries [38].\nNeuroML Level 1 also allows metadata, which is important for\ntracking the provenance of the model components and for\nproviding background information on the model. A number of\nelements are included to provide structured information on the\noriginal authors of the model, translators of the model to\nNeuroML format, publications, and references to entries in\nFigure 1. Relationship between the three Levels of NeuroML and MorphML, ChannelML and NetworkML.Level 1 incorporates\nMorphML, which allows descriptions of cell structure ranging from single compartment cells to detailed cells based on morphological\nreconstructions. Metadata describing the provenance of the data (authors, citations, etc.) can be used at this and subsequent Levels. Level 2 buildson\nLevel 1 to specify the passive properties and the location and densities of active conductances on the cell, and includes ChannelML, for description of\nthe membrane processes that generate the electrophysiological behavior of cells. Level 3 contains NetworkML, allowing networks of these neuronal\nmodels and their synaptic connections to be described. MorphML, ChannelML and NetworkML can be used in isolation to describe model\ncomponents, while a Level X file can include any elements from that and any lower Level.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000815.g001\nThe NeuroML Model Description Language\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 3 June 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e1000815\ndatabases such as ModelDB [43] and NeuroMorpho.org [44], as\nwell as text based comments. The concept of model stability (the\nstatus element) is also included to allow a record of any known\nlimitations of the model. Two types of unit system are allowed in\nNeuroML, SI Units and Physiological Units (ms, mV, cm, etc.),\nand only one of these must be used consistently in relevant\nelements of a NeuroML file. This facilitates the correct conversion\nof physical quantities to the unit system of each supported\napplication.\nNeuroML Level 2\nThe second Level of the NeuroML language describes the\nelectrical properties of the membrane that underlie rapid signaling\nin the brain. The two main parts of this Level are: an extension of\nthe morphological descriptions from Level 1 that includes details\nof the passive electrical properties and channel densities on various\nparts of the cell (Level 2 cell in Figure 4); and ChannelML, which\nallows descriptions of the individual conductance mechanisms\n(Figure 5). ChannelML supports two main types of conductances:\nthose that arise from channels distributed over the plasma\nmembrane (channel_type element), such as voltage-gated conduc-\ntances or conductances gated by intracellular ions (e.g. [Ca\n2+]\ndependent potassium conductances); and conductances arising at\nsynaptic contacts ( synapse_type). Distributed conductances are\nnormally specified by describing the transition rates between\nchannel states and their voltage dependence (Figure 3; Supporting\nText S1). This allows specification of channel gating models with\nthe traditional Hodgkin-Huxley formalism (with multiple instances\nFigure 2. Relationship between experimental data and model components expressed in NeuroML.Experimental neuroscience data is\nmeasured at different scales describing subcellular, cellular and network properties and NeuroML provides a framework to describe models\ndeveloped using this data at all of these levels. Once models are defined in NeuroML they can either be directly imported into a simulator or\ntranslated via a metasimulator like neuroConstruct. Optimization of such data-driven models involves an iterative process of experimentation,\ncreation of models, comparison with data and refinement of models, and suggestions for new experiments based on modeling results.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000815.g002\nThe NeuroML Model Description Language\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 4 June 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e1000815\nof identical gates; e.g. Figure 3A) or with more detailed state-based\nkinetic (Markov) models (of which the HH model is a special case).\nA wide range of examples of voltage-gated conductances are\nsupported by ChannelML including those underlying fast and\npersistent Na\n+ currents, delayed rectifier, A- and M-type K +\ncurrents, H-currents and L- and T-type Ca2+ currents. [Ca2+]\ndependent BK and SK type channels can also be expressed. The\ncommonly used Q10 function for temperature dependence of\ntransition rates can be added. While the focus of NeuroML to date\nhas been on more detailed conductance based models, Chan-\nnelML also supports a basic integrate-and-fire neuron model.\nHowever, more advanced types of reduced model such as\nexponential integrate and fire or Izhikevich spiking neurons are\nnot yet supported (see Discussion for future plans for support of\nmore abstract neuronal representations).\nBoth neurotransmitter gated conductances at chemical synapses\nand gap junction conductances at electrical synapses are supported\nin ChannelML (Figure 5). Conductance changes at chemical\nsynapses are defined by a time course which can have a number of\nforms including an exponential rise and up to three decay\ncomponents. These conductances include both the simple linear\nohmic type (for modeling most AMPA and GABA\nA receptor\nmediated synapses) and non-linear voltage-dependent components\n(for modeling the Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor mediated\nsynaptic component). Activity dependent synaptic plasticity is\nimplemented with two mechanisms in ChannelML: a short-term\nplasticity (STP) mechanism based on a widely used STP model\n[45] incorporating both depression and facilitation components\nand a spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanism based\non the model of Song and Abbott [46], but simulator support for\nSTDP is presently limited. NeuroML provides representations of\nphenomenological models of synaptic plasticity that can reproduce\na wide range of behavior including short-term facilitation and\ndepression and Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning, thus\naccommodating synaptic plasticity over a wide range of time\nscales where adequate simulator support exists.\nFigure 3.

Elements for representing cells in NeuroML Levels 1-3.The main element for expressing a branching neuronal structure in\nNeuroML iscell which is used for all Levels in NeuroML. The core of the cell description is a set ofsegment elements which describe the 3D shape of\nthe cell. These can be grouped intocables which represent unbranched neurites of the cell. Metadata present in the cell description can contain\ndetails of the creators of the cell model, or the data on which it was based (e.g. a neuronal reconstruction from NeuroMorpho.org). Addition of the\nbiophysics element allows a Level 2 conductance based spiking cell model to be described, and theconnectivity element can be used for the allowed\nThe NeuroML Model Description Language\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 6 June 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e1000815\nLevel 2 also allows the location and density of membrane\nconductances described in ChannelML to be specified on regions\nof the cell (e.g. soma, axon, apical dendrites). The passive electrical\nproperties of the cell (e.g. specific axial resistance and specific\nmembrane capacitance) can be defined in a similar manner (using\nthe biophysics element; see Figure 4). Moreover, non-uniform\nchannel densities can be implemented using a metric, such as the\npath distance from soma, and expressing the density in terms of\nthis metric (using the variable_parameter element). Although\nNeuroML Level 2 is required for defining a full spiking neuron\nmodel, elements of the models can be defined as standalone\ndescriptions in MorphML and ChannelML, thereby facilitating\nthe exchange and reuse of individual model components.\nNeuroML Level 3\nThe third Level of NeuroML allows specification of the 3D\nanatomical structure and synaptic connectivity of a network of\nneurons, together with the properties of the external input used to\ndrive the network. NeuroML Level 3 has two main purposes: to\ndefine NetworkML (Figure 6) and to allow extension of Level 2\ncells with specification of regions of the cell membrane (e.g. apical\ndendrites) to which specific synaptic connections are limited\n(connectivity element; Figure 4). Thus complex networks with\ndifferent types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons can be defined,\nincluding dendritic sub-region specific synaptic connections. There\nare two possible ways to describe networks in NetworkML: an\nexplicit list of instances of cell positions and synaptic connections\n(instance based representation); or as an algorithmic template for\ndescribing how instances of the network should be generated, for\nexample to place 300 cells randomly in a certain 3D region\n(template based representation). The instance based representation\nis quite compact, even for large scale simulations, because a\nnetwork with 10,000 identical neurons will only have one instance\nof the cell description and a list of 10,000 locations. To date, this\nhas proven a more useful and portable format. Only a limited\nrange of network templates is currently supported, though these\nare in the process of being updated for the next version of\nNeuroML (see Discussion). The instance based representation can\nalso include information on the computational node a cell should\nbe run on (node_id attribute) to facilitate execution of large scale\nnetworks on parallel computing hardware (Supporting Text S1).\nThere are three core elements for describing networks in\nNetworkML: population specifies the numbers of cells of a specific\ntype, together with their locations in 3D space;projection defines the\nset of synaptic connections between two populations or within a\nsingle population, by identifying the precise location of the synapse\non the pre- and postsynaptic neuronal morphology and specifying\nthe type of synapse(s) present; and input describes an external\nelectrical input into the network. Inputs can take the form of a\ncurrent pulse delivered by model electrodes or random synaptic\nstimulation.\nSimulator support and conversion of NeuroML to textual\nand graphical formats\nThe key goals of the NeuroML initiative are to make models\nand their components exchangeable, simulator independent and\naccessible to a wide range of researchers. To this end several\nsoftware applications for compartmental modeling have been\nextended to support NeuroML. The most extensive support for\nNeuroML at present is provided by neuroConstruct which is an\napplication for building, visualizing and analyzing networks of\ncompartmental neurons in 3D space [39]. It uses an internal\nrepresentation for cells that is closely related to NeuroML and can\nimport and export model components in MorphML, ChannelML\nand NetworkML (in XML or a more compact HDF5-based binary\nformat) or a complete description of a network model in a single\nLevel 3 file. There is support for plotting channel properties (e.g.\nvoltage dependence of rates; Figure 3C) and analyzing properties\nof neuronal morphologies and networks. Simulator specific scripts\nfor NEURON, GENESIS, MOOSE, PSICS and PyNN can also\nbe automatically generated from NeuroML files and executed, and\nsimulation results can be reloaded for visualization and analysis\n(Figure 2).\nNEURON allows native import and export of cells in both\nLevel 1 and 2 NeuroML formats [47]. This allows cell models\ncreated in NEURON native scripts to be exported in a\nstandardized format. All channel types currently in ChannelML\nc a nb ec o n v e r t e dt oN E U R O Nd u et ot h ef l e x i b l en a t u r eo ft h e\nNMODL language [48]. GENESIS 2 [26] does not natively\nsupport NeuroML, but a mapping to this format is provided via\nneuroConstruct. MOOSE (Multiscale Object-Oriented Simula-\ntion Environment) [27] has been developed as part of the\nGENESIS 3 initiative, but is based on a complete reimplemen-\ntation of the core of GENESIS. Scripts specifically for MOOSE\ncan be generated by neuroConstruct and are for the most part\nidentical to GENESIS 2 scripts, and native support for\nNeuroML in MOOSE is in development. NeuroML mappings\nhave also been created for the recently developed PSICS\nsimulator, and scripts for running single cell models on this\nsimulator can be generated through neuroConstruct. There is\nalso some native support in PSICS for importing MorphML and\nChannelML. PyNN [49] is a Python package for creating\nnetwork models for multiple simulators (including NEST [28]\nand NEURON), and support for mappings to and from\nNeuroML has recently been added. Table 1 summarizes the\ncurrent support in each of the aforementioned tools for various\nt y p e so fm o d e l sw h i c hc a nb ee x p r e s s e di nN e u r o M L .I n\naddition to the applications mentioned here, native support for\nvarious parts of NeuroML is currently in development in\nsoftware applications not asso ciated with the authors of this\npaper, including CX3D [50] and PCSIM [51]. NeuroML\nsupport is in development for Neurospaces [52], also being\ndeveloped as part of the GENESIS 3initiative. The latest details\nof software support for NeuroML can be found at http://www.\nneuroml.org/tool_support.\nTo help researchers convert their existing models to NeuroML,\nwe have generated a number of sample documents on the\nNeuroML website (http://www.neuroml.org/examples), which\ncan be viewed in the original XML or converted to more readable\nformats (e.g. Figure 3B). There is also a software application for\nvalidating NeuroML files to check that they are compliant.\nMorphML cells and NetworkML files can be converted for\nvisualizing in 3D in a web browser using an X3D compatible plug-\nin. Moreover, MorphML and ChannelML files can be converted\nonline to a number of simulator formats including NEURON,\nGENESIS/MOOSE and PSICS, using the XML Stylesheet (XSL)\nbased mapping files which have been developed for each simulator\nsynaptic connectivity of a Level 3 cell (e.g. to be used when connecting the cell in a network). A detailed description of each of these elements can be\nfound in Supporting Text S1. Only the elements in Level 1 which are normally used in compartmental cell modeling are shown in the figure. Other\nelements such asfreePoints, features etc. could be present in a Level 1 file from a camera lucida reconstruction [38].\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000815.g004\nThe NeuroML Model Description Language\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 7 June 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e1000815\n(Materials and Methods). In order to test the mappings from\nNeuroML to these simulators and other tools, we have converted a\nnumber of existing, published models to NeuroML.\nValidation of NeuroML\nTo test that NeuroML descriptions of cell morphology and\nconductances can produce similar results across supported simulators,\nFigure 5. Elements in ChannelML.ChannelML allows expression of models of voltage (and ligand) gated conductances which are dispersed\nacross the cell membrane (inchannel_type element), conductances which are concentrated at synaptic contacts (insynapse_type element) and basic\nmodels of time varying internal ion concentrations (inion_concentration element). Distributed conductance descriptions contain a number ofgate\nelements, which describe the transitions between conducting and non conducting states of the channels underlying the conductances. A number of\nsynaptic conductance models are allowed including simple double exponential waveforms, AMPA and NMDA receptor mediated synapses, Short\nTerm Plasticity (STP) models, Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) models, and electrical synapses. Theion_concentration element can be used\nfor the simple models of exponentially decaying Ca\n2+ pools often used in detailed cell models.

This model was\nchosen because it contains three conductances that are non-uniformly\ndistributed over the dendritic tree. The behavior of the ChannelML\nrepresentation of the 6 conductances was first verified using a single\ncompartment cell (Supporting Figure S1). The detailed 3D cell and its\nresponse to a brief current injection in the soma are shown in Figure 7.\nThe time courses of the membrane potential at various points along\nthe cell was directly compared for the four simulators (Figure 7A).\nDespite important differences in the way each simulator handles the\nsimulation of the cell anatomy and channels (e.g. the morphology was\nmapped to a reduced number of compartments on GENESIS/\nMOOSE, and the numbers of ion channels and their individual\npositions were explicitly calculated in PSICS; Materials and\nMethods), the physiologically measurable output of the cell was very\nsimilar across all simulators tested (Figure 7B–D) confirming the\nsimulator-independence of the NeuroML model description on short\ntimescales and for a realistic neuronal morphology.\nTo test the synaptic models defined in NeuroML, we compared\nthe behavior of a number of supported models between simulators.\nThe ChannelML implementation of an electrical synapse was\ntested by comparing simulations run on GENESIS, MOOSE and\nNEURON. The voltage responses in a pair of passive model\nneurons connected by a gap junction to a step current injected into\none of the cells gave rise to identical results in these simulators\n(Figure 8A). Neurotransmission at excitatory chemical synapses is\nmediated predominantly by glutamate in the mammalian brain.\nGlutamate typically activates AMPA receptors (Figure 8B), which\nhave a simple ohmic conductance and NMDA receptors, which\nexhibit a nonlinear voltage dependent conductance due to Mg\n2+\nblock (Figure 8C). In all cases the results from NEURON,\nGENESIS and MOOSE match for simulations derived from the\nChannelML description. The ChannelML implementation of a\nsynaptic Short Term Plasticity (STP) model [45] was also\ncompared using NEST and NEURON. Altering the model\nparameters to favor short-term depression or facilitation gave\nidentical results (Figure 8D) using both simulators.\nTo test the support for network representations in NeuroML, we\nconverted the elements of the thalamocortical column network\nmodel developed by Traub et al. [15] to NeuroML, as this is one of\nthe most advanced multi-cellular network models published to date.\nThe electrical behavior of the model arises from 22 voltage- and\nligand-gated Na+,K + and Ca2+ conductances together with both\nelectrical and chemical synapses, which were all converted to\nChannelML and tested (Figure 9A, Materials and Methods). Each\nof the 14 cell types present was converted to NeuroML, using the\nLevel 2 cell export function of NEURON and import function of\nneuroConstruct (Supporting Figure S2). Supporting Tables S1 and\nS2 list the cell and channel types respectively. The different\ncomplements of the channels and different morphologies gave rise\nto a variety of behaviors including regular spiking, fast spiking and\nbursting behavior (Figure 9B–E). The NeuroML implementation\nproduced qualitatively similar spiking behavior for simulations run\nin NEURON, GENESIS and MOOSE in the 10 electrophysio-\nlogically distinct cells during sustained firing over hundreds of\nmilliseconds to seconds (Supporting Figure S3). However, differ-\nences in the timing of spikes was evident in some of the cells, unless\nthe spatial and temporal discretisation of the cell was increased\nsubstantially. Two observations confirmed that the main cause of\ndivergence in spike times arose from the use of symmetrical\ncompartments (where axial resistance is split and numerical\nintegration takes place at the center of the compartment) and\nasymmetrical compartments (axial resistance is located at one end of\nthe compartment). Firstly, the spike times of a single compartment\ncell with all the channel conductances included were indistinguish-\nable on NEURON, GENESIS and MOOSE (Figure 9A), confirm-\ning the ChannelML implementations allowed equivalent behavior\non all 3 simulators. Secondly, when the spatial discretisation of the\ncell models was increased, all simulators tended toward the same\nspike times (Supporting Figure S4), with GENESIS (for which\nasymmetrical compartments had to be used, see Materials and\nMethods) generally requiring a finer discretisation. These results\nFigure 6.

Moreover, true\ninteroperability, as measured through model convergence, may only\noccur at the limits of spatial and temporal discretisation.\nOnce all the channel, synaptic and cellular components of the\nmodel were converted to NeuroML and tested, we used\nneuroConstruct [39] to build a 56 cell Layer 2/3 network that\nmatched as closely as possible a previous larger scale model which\nuses these cells [16]. This consisted of regular spiking and fast\nrhythmic bursting pyramidal cells and low threshold spiking, axo-\naxonic and basket type interneurons (Figure 10A, Materials and\nMethods). As specified in the original model, excitatory and\ninhibitory synaptic conductances were located on specific dendritic\nand somatic segments and electrical synapses were included within\ncell populations. This network model was not tuned against any\nnew experimental data and is primarily intended as a test case for\ncomparison of network behavior across simulators. The spike\ntimes of the neuronal populations were similar across the 3\nsimulators over the first 200 ms of the simulation, when a small\nsimulation timestep and fine spatial discretisation was used\n(Figure 10B). At longer times, some spikes became shifted and\nothers appeared or disappeared depending on the simulator. This\ndivergence in model behavior occurred earlier in the simulation\nrun and was much more pronounced when a more typical time\nstep and coarser discretisation was used (Supporting Figure S5),\nsuggesting that in practice, the precise spike times, and even the\noccurrence of some spikes produced by complex network models,\nwill depend on the simulator implementation. A complete\ndescription of this network model including cell structure,\nchannels, synapses, and lists of cell locations and connections\ncan be represented in a single Level 3 NeuroML file.\nDiscussion\nSummary\nWe have developed, implemented and tested NeuroML, a\nsimulator-independent neuronal model description language for\ndefining data-driven models of neurons and networks with a high\nFigure 7.

This XML based language has a\nmodular structure and the current version is sufficiently advanced\nto allow the description of the complex branching structures of\ndendritic trees and axonal projections, their biophysical properties,\nvoltage- and calcium-gated ion channels, chemical synapses with\nshort-term synaptic plasticity, electrical synapses, and both large\nand small scale network structure. The implementation and\ninteroperability of models expressed in NeuroML were tested and\nthe functionality illustrated by expressing existing single neuron\nand network models of different brain regions in this format and\nby demonstrating equivalent model behavior on different\nsimulators.\nModel interoperability, validation and reuse\nProviding a structured, declarative framework for describing\ndetailed neuronal models that is independent of any particular\nsimulator implementation has a number of important benefits.\nFirstly, the behavioral properties of a model specified in NeuroML\ncan be compared across simulators. This is important for testing\nthe validity of results from a model, since all conclusions should be\nsimulator-independent. Model comparison also aids bug identifi-\ncation, tests the robustness of a particular model implementation,\nhighlights performance bottlenecks and promotes collaboration\nbetween different simulator communities. Secondly, describing\nmodel components with structured schemas written in XML\nfacilitates machine automated validation of particular components\n(e.g. the integrity of a complex neuronal morphology defined in\nMorphML). Thirdly, the modular structure of NeuroML, and the\nstandalone nature of many of the mechanisms, facilitates reuse of\nmodel components. This speeds up the construction of models and\nallows models with increasing biological detail to be built from\npreviously developed components. This is important because\ndetailed conductance-based neuronal models are labor intensive to\ndevelop, often taking years to go from initial experiments to\npublished model. Enabling interoperability will accelerate the rate\nof progress by allowing investigators to use and extend previous\nwork, rather than ‘reinventing the wheel’ each time they want to\nbuild a new model. Such models will also provide a ready-made\nresource for developing and testing new software tools in this area.\nModel components defined in NeuroML can be automatically\ntransformed into textual and graphical formats familiar to neuro-\nphysiologists (Figure 3B, C). This allows access to the mechanisms\nand parameters underlying the model for researchers unfamiliar with\nsimulator scripting languages. Moreover, NeuroML compliant tools\nwith user friendly graphical user interfaces, such as neuroConstruct,\nallow neuronal and network models to be visualized, modified and\nrun without the need to write code. This increased accessibility and\ntransparency also allows critical evaluation by a wider range of\nneuroscientists including both theoreticians and experimentalists.\nPublicly exposing the details of a model implementation will\nFigure 8.

By providing a common language for simulators and tools to\ninteract, NeuroML can help reduce the barriers between computa-\ntional and experimental neuroscience, thereby encouraging wider use\nof such detailed models.\nPractical aspects of using NeuroML and limits to\ninteroperability\nTranslation of an existing model to NeuroML can be achieved\nusing the export function of one of the supporting applications, but\nthis normally requires a detailed knowledge of the scripting\nlanguage of at least one simulator. As tool support for the language\nincreases, the goal is that the handling of XML will happen\n‘‘behind the scenes’’, as is the case in many SBML compliant\napplications. At the moment however some manual editing is\nusually required, especially for ChannelML files. Import and\nexport of NeuroML for supporting simulators is currently ‘‘lossy’’\nbecause not all simulators use all of the information available (e.g.\ninformation that a group of cables represents ‘‘the axon’’ is not\nretained on import into most simulators). For these reasons,\nFigure 9. Comparison of the behavior of NeuroML-based cortical and thalamic cell models run on NEURON, GENESIS and MOOSE\nsimulators.

At the\ncoarsest level, not all simulators can run all models because they\nare often designed for a particular application. For example,\nNEST has mainly focused on integrate-and-fire neuronal models\nand PSICS can presently only run single cell models. At a finer\nlevel of detail, the way in which a simulator represents a feature of\nthe model may also be fundamentally different. In PSICS the\nlocation of individual ion channels is defined explicitly, whereas\nFigure 10.

Our results show that a key\nreason why the spike times of some multicompartmental cell\nmodels can diverge between simulators is the different way they\ntreat neuronal morphology and the different locations at which the\nvoltage is computed within each compartment. While increasing\nspatial discretisation and decreasing time step lead to model\nconvergence (Supporting Figure S4, Figure 10), for some cells this\nonly occurred in computationally inefficient regimes. Such direct\ncomparison of the performance of different simulators will allow\nthe most efficient solution to be identified, potentially improving\noverall simulator implementations. We have used basic measures\nof model performance such as spike times to assay convergence of\nmodel behavior. However, more sophisticated measures will need\nto be developed to ensure that the accuracy of the interoperability\nachieved is sufficient for modeling a particular biological system.\nNeuroML has reached a state of maturity where it can be used\nto specify a wide range of published single neuron and network\nmodels. However, there are a number of features of the nervous\nsystem that have not been covered in current schemas because our\ninitial priority was to focus on ensuring that NeuroML was\nbackwards compatible with most types of compartmental models\ndeveloped to date. Also, support for the wide array of simplified\nabstract neuron models currently in use is limited. Moreover, since\na major requirement for NeuroML was interoperability between\nexisting conductance based simulators, functions that only operate\non a specific simulator or that would have to be developed de\nnovo, were not the primary concern. Nevertheless, the horizontal,\nmodular design of NeuroML makes it easier to add extensions for\nnew mechanisms that cannot be described by current schemas.\nWhile there is sufficient flexibility within the current language\nfor creating detailed neuronal models of different brain regions\nwith a wide diversity of custom channel types, morphological\nfeatures and network connectivity, some researchers may wish to\nbuild on the basic NeuroML elements to encode features of their\nmodels not present in the core language. Options currently\navailable for this include adding application specific information in\nmetadata elements (e.g. annotating models with visualization\ninformation or adding a proprietary subclass of an element, such\nas a voltage dependent gap junction), creating hybrid models\npartially described in NeuroML and partially in native simulator\nscript (e.g. channels in both ChannelML and NMODL format),\nand creating a domain specific XML Schema, which includes\nNeuroML for neuronal elements (e.g. a language for describing\nbrain regions including vasculature which reuses the NeuroML\nschemas). These options are discussed in more detail at http://\nwww.neuroml.org/NeuroMLValidator/Extending.jsp. These ex-\ntension mechanisms enable greater flexibility than the current\nversion of NeuroML affords and provides a bridge to new\nfunctionality before it can be formally incorporated into a new\nversion of the language.\nRelationship of NeuroML to other standardization\ninitiatives and databases\nThere are a number of initiatives to standardize model\ndescriptions and data formats in biology. One of the most\nsuccessful of these is the development of XML-based structured\nformats for describing models in systems biology [30,31]. The\nacceptance of these formats as standards has been promoted by\nseveral journals (e.g. Nature Molecular Systems Biology), which\nencourage that model scripts be made available in SBML or\nCellML. NeuroML differs from these low level model description\nlanguages in that it implicitly contains high level concepts such as\nneuronal morphologies, synapses and network connections. This is\nnecessary because NeuroML covers models that span many levels\nof description of the nervous system. While this is ultimately less\nflexible than CellML and SBML which describe models explicitly\nin terms of the mathematical expressions for its interacting\ncomponents, it still allows a wide range of new models to be\ndescribed including kinetic models of ion channels, synaptic\nmodels with distinct kinetic behavior, neuronal models with\ndifferent ion channel complements and morphologies and\nnetworks with different anatomical connectivity.\nIn neuroscience, where models and data formats are highly\ndiverse, there are a number of initiatives to improve interopera-\nbility and accessibility. BrainML (http://www.brainml.org) is also\na structured XML-based language, but BrainML is principally\ndesigned for exchanging neuroscience data rather than defining\nneuronal and network models. The recent addition of Python\nbased scripting interfaces to a number of simulators such as NEST\n[53], NEURON [47], MOOSE [27], and Brian [54] is a\npromising step towards greater model interoperability and has\nlead to the development of PyNN [49], a Python package for\nsimulator-independent specification of neuronal network models.\nInstead of developing a declarative language for describing models\nas in NeuroML, this approach defines a Python application\nprogramming interface (API) to build models in a procedural\nmanner. Scripts in this format can be used on multiple existing\nsimulators. NeuroML is complementary to PyNN and cooperation\nbetween these initiatives aims to allow the creation of networks of\nNeuroML Level 2 cells by PyNN scripts and to extend the\ntemplate based NetworkML descriptions so that they are\ncompatible with PyNN.\nThe future of NeuroML\nThe future success of NeuroML depends on its adoption by the\ncommunity and the willingness of simulator developers to make\ntheir software NeuroML compliant. NeuroML development is\nOpen Source, allowing all interested parties to contribute to the\nlanguage. We are presently gathering requirements and specifica-\ntions from experimentalists, software developers and theoreticians\nfor future developments of NeuroML, which will increase the scope\nof the language, and permit more complex neuronal models to be\nspecified, and we are actively engaged with standardization\ninitiatives of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating\nFacility (INCF). It is envisaged that NeuroML will evolve gradually\nfrom the present structure, which reflects a pragmatic functional\nsolution to the interoperability problem, into a more generic flexible\nformat, that links into other standards (e.g. SBML, CellML and\nMathML) and that is less homologous to implementations in\nexisting simulators. For example, greater support for model\ncomponents in SBML/CellML would enable more sophisticated\nsynaptic transmission and plasticity models, pharmacological\nperturbation of cell behavior or creation of more abstract cell\nmodels. Backward compatibility of any future changes to NeuroML\nwill be ensured through automated file conversion. We plan to\nincrease the existing set of NeuroML based cell and network models\nfor different brain regions, together with further development of a\nrange of compliant applications for searching for, building,\nvisualizing, simulating and analyzing the models, thereby providing\ntheoreticians and experimentalists with a powerful toolbox for\naddressing fundamental questions about brain function.\nMaterials and Methods\nXML\nXML [40] is commonly used for data exchange between\nsoftware applications and a number of generic tools and\nThe NeuroML Model Description Language\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 15 June 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e1000815\ntechnologies have been developed to handle these types of files.\nThe structure of the data an application can expect in an XML file\ncan be defined using an XML Schema (XSD) file, and XML files\ncan be automatically checked for validity against this schema\nbefore use. A number of such files are used to define the structure\nof NeuroML, and the modular nature of the language is enabled\nby having separate schema files for MorphML, ChannelML, etc.\nand importing as appropriate for each Level description. A\ndetailed description of the contents of the NeuroML schemas is in\nSupporting Text S1.\nThere are a number of methods for transforming XML\ndocuments into formats suitable for different applications. One\nway is to create an XML Stylesheet (XSL) file, which allows\ntransformation of the data in the XML file into another text file\nformat. XSL files have been created for transformation of\nNeuroML files to HTML (e.g. Figure 3B) and a number of\nsimulator specific formats (as are used to convert example files at\nhttp:/www.neuroml.org). This approach has the advantage that\nscripts in the native language of the simulator can be generated,\nwhich doesn’t require changing the code of the simulator. Another\nmethod is to parse the XML files directly using the Document\nObject Model (DOM) approach where a treelike structure is built\nup in application memory of the contents of the file (suitable for\nsmaller files, e.g. ChannelML descriptions) or the Simple API for\nXML (SAX) approach where the contents of a larger file (e.g. a\nNetworkML instance based description) is parsed sequentially\nfrom start to finish.\nCA1 pyramidal cell\nThe CA1 Pyramidal cell model (Figure 7) is based on a model\nused in (Migliore et al., 2005), and the NEURON scripts for this\nwere obtained from the ModelDB repository (accession number\n55035). The model was executed in NEURON and the Model-\nView tool was used to export the cell in NeuroML Level 2. Full\nexport of the cell model including information on all channel\ndensities was not possible, as the densities of a number of channels\n(those underlying the H current (hd) and proximal (kap) and distal\n(kad) A-type potassium currents) were adjusted with custom\nfunctions in file fig2A.hoc (densities varied as linear functions of\ndistance from the soma). The information on the function to create\nthese densities is lost once the cells are created in NEURON. The\nvalues of channel densities of hd, kap and kad at the centre of\nsections were included in the exported NeuroML file giving an\napproximation to the linear function. The cell also contained a\npassive conductance (pas), a delayed rectifier K\n+ (kdr) conductance\nand Na+ conductances on the axon (nax) and soma/dendrites\n(na3).\nOnce the Level 2 file was imported to neuroConstruct (cell\nCA1_imported in the project mentioned below) a copy of the cell\nwas created (cell CA1), the exported channel densities for hd, kap\nand kad were removed, and Variable Mechanisms added for these\nchannels specifying the changes in densities in terms of the\ndistance from the soma. These Variable Mechanisms and the\nParameterized Groups (e.g. PathLengthOverDendrites) have\ncorresponding elements in NeuroML, so the cells can be imported\nand exported in NeuroML without loss of information. Also,\nNeuroML files from other sources can use non-uniform expres-\nsions for channel densities that will be preserved on import to\nneuroConstruct. The channel mechanisms were manually con-\nverted to ChannelML using neuroConstruct (see http://www.\nneuroconstruct.org/docs/importneuron.html). Using a single\ncompartment cell with a passive conductance and each of the\nchannels in turn and comparing the membrane potential and the\nstate variables of the channels allowed validation of the\nrepresentation of the channels in ChannelML (see Simulation\nConfiguration OneChannelCells for an example). The default\nsimulation configuration generates a single segment cell with all 6\nchannels and was used to validate the behavior of the channels, as\nillustrated in Figure S1.\nThe mappings of cell morphologies between MorphML,\nneuroConstruct, NEURON and GENESIS formats are discussed\nin detail in (Crook et al., 2007). In brief, a cell consists of cables\n(termed sections in neuroConstruct) containing one or more\nsegments which provide the 3D points/diameters as obtained in\nthe cell reconstruction. The CA1 cell in this example had 173\ncables containing a total of 2243 segments. The NEURON\nmapping of the cell is straightforward, the cables/sections are\nmapped to NEURON sections, with segments providing the pt3d\npoints along the sections. Associated with each section in\nneuroConstruct there is a number indicating the internal divisions\nto be used for spatial discretisation, which is mapped to\nNEURON’s nseg variable.\nIn GENESIS and MOOSE, the basic entities from which cells\nare composed are cylindrical/spherical compartments with no\ninternal divisions. As opposed to making a one to one mapping\nfrom each segment to a compartment, there is a function in\nneuroConstruct which maps sections (e.g. containing 20 segments\nwith number internal divisions/nseg = 4) on to a set of compart-\nments with an equivalent length, surface area and total axial\nresistance, based on this spatial discretisation (the example above\nwould be mapped to 4 compartments with the radii chosen\nappropriately). More details on this conversion process can be\nfound at: http://www.neuroconstruct.org/docs/Glossary_gen.\nhtml#Compartmentalisation. The script files for which are\ngenerated for MOOSE are almost identical to those for\nGENESIS, with some minor alterations to cater for differences\nin message handling, the different use of symmetric/asymmetric\ncompartments between the simulators and the lack of native\ngraphical interface support in MOOSE.\nThe representation of morphologies in PSICS is based on a list\nof points defining the cell structure, and there is no inbuilt concept\nof a cable. A PSICS file containing these points is generated by\nneuroConstruct from the cell’s segment information. Points can\nhave labels associated with them and these are used to associate\nthe points with the groups present in the cell (soma_group,\napical_dendrite, etc.), and these can be then used in the\ndistribution of channels to various areas of the cell. While PSICS\nwas designed to be able to investigate effects of the stochastic\nnature of channels, in this case the channels were modeled\ndeterministically, to allow direct comparison with the noise free\nsimulations of NEURON & GENESIS/MOOSE.\nThe Simulation Configuration in the neuroConstruct project to\nreproduce the traces in Figure 7 is called CA1Cell. The cell\nrequired a finer spatial discretisation than present in the original\nmodel (the sections in neuroConstruct had a total of 3008 internal\ndivisions; these were mapped to NEURON sections with a total\nnseg of 3008, and mapped to 3090 GENESIS/MOOSE\ncompartments). PSICS decides itself on the cell’s compartmental-\nization based on a maximum value given to it for structural\ndiscretisation (in this case 1.3\nmm) which resulted in 7821\ncompartments.\nA zipped file containing all of the NeuroML elements used in\nthis model and or a full neuroConstruct project (CA1Pyramidal-\nCell.ncx) which can be used to run the cell model on NEURON,\nGENESIS, MOOSE or PSICS are available at: http://www.\nneuroml.org/models. The simulations were carried out with\nNEURON version 6.2, GENESIS v2.3, MOOSE SVN revision\n1473, PSICS v1.0.6, and neuroConstruct v1.3.4.\nThe NeuroML Model Description Language\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 16 June 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e1000815\nSynaptic mechanisms\nThe NeuroML specification for the electrical synapse model was\nused to generate simulation scripts for NEURON, GENESIS and\nMOOSE through neuroConstruct. The neuroConstruct project\n(Ex9_Synapses.ncx, included with the standard download of\nneuroConstruct, or available here: http://www.neuroConstruct.\norg/samples) can be used to generate this example and a number\nof others including networks of multiple spiking neurons connected by\ngap junctions, for execution on the different simulators. All generated\nnetworks can also be exported to valid NeuroML Level 3 files.\nThe ChannelML implementations of AMPA and NMDA\nreceptors were tested in NEURON, GENESIS and MOOSE\nusing voltage clamp to simulate EPSCs (Figure 8B & C). In both\ncases a passive compartment having leak conductance of\n3.061029 mS mm22 and capacitance 161028 mF mm22 received\nsynaptic inputs whose strength and relative weight had been\nadjusted so as to match experimental voltage clamp data [8].\nSynaptic input was then applied to the clamped cell at holding\npotentials of 220mV and 280mV and the clamp current was\nrecorded. NeuroML representations of these synapse models are\ncontained in the neuroConstruct project mentioned above.\nTo test STP (Short Term Plasticity) (Figure 8D) a spontaneously\nactive presynaptic cell (integrate and fire neuron with leak\nconductance having a reversal potential just above spiking\nthreshold) was connected to a postsynaptic integrate and fire cell\nby a conductance based STP synapse. The subthreshold response of\nthe postsynaptic cell was then monitored as it received regular spikes\nfrom the pre-synaptic cell. To examine synaptic depression, the\nfacilitation time constant tau_fac was set to 0 while the recovery\ntime constant tau_rec was set to 120ms. To examine synaptic\nfacilitation, tau_rec was set to 0 while tau_fac was set to 300ms. STP\nwas turned off in the control case by setting the facilitation and\nrecovery parameters both to 0. See Supporting Text S1 for a\ndetailed description of the STP mechanism. The NeuroML\nspecification of the model was converted into simulation scripts\nfor PyNN using neuroConstruct. PyNN was then used to run the\nsimulation in both NEURON and NEST, producing the similar\ntraces as shown in Figure 8D. In the neuroConstruct project\nEx8_PyNNDemo.ncx (available from http://www.neuroConstruct.\norg/samples; simulation configuration STPDemo), there are three\npostsynaptic cells all connected to the presynaptic cell. Each\npostsynaptic cell connects with one of: control synapse, facilitating\nsynapse, depressing synapse. This allows all examples to executed\nsimultaneously.\nThese examples were generated with NEURON v6.2, GEN-\nESIS v2.3, MOOSE SVN revision 1473, NEST v1.9.8017,\nneuroConstruct v1.3.4 and PyNN v0.5.0.\nThalamocortical cell models\nThe full network model from [15] was originally developed in\nFortran for execution in parallel on 14 CPUs. The cell models were\nconverted from this to NEURON format together with the network\nconnectivity. Both the original Fortran and NEURON scripts are\navailable on ModelDB (accession number 45539). A discussion on\nthe conversion of the model from Fortran to NEURON format is\navailable at: http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.\nasp?model = 82894&file = \\nrntraub\\README.\nThe cells in NEURON format were taken as a starting point for\nthe conversion to NeuroML. Supporting Table S1 lists the cell\ntypes present. Each of the cells has a set of voltage and ligand\ngated ion channels on its membrane, along with a passive\nconductance and an exponentially decaying pool of calcium. The\nfull list of conductance types are given in Table S2. These channels\nwere manually converted from NMODL format to ChannelML\nusing neuroConstruct. The channels were individually tested to\nensure that the ChannelML reproduced the behavior of the\noriginal mod file implementation and that the mappings to\nNEURON, GENESIS and MOOSE matched. To validate the\nsimulator independence of a cell with multiple channels in this\nformat, we tested a single compartment cell with all 22 of these of\nthese active conductances the passive conductance and internal\npool of calcium. Figure 9A shows the behavior of the membrane\npotential and a number of internal channel variables of the cell on\nNEURON, GENESIS and MOOSE. The timestep for the\nsimulation was 0.005 ms. Note that neither this simple cell, nor\nany of the more detailed cells, can be run on PSICS as that\nsimulator does not currently support ligand gated channels (e.g. kc,\nkahp).\nThe cells were exported from NEURON in NeuroML Level 2\nformat via ModelView and imported into neuroConstruct. The\ncorrect channel densities were included with the Level 2 file but\nthe morphologies were generally of the format as seen in Figure\nS2A. This is due to there being no 3D positions information\nassociated with the sections when they were created in NEURON\n(the original cortical column network model was 1D), and the\nrepresentation below shows the points (in a 2D plane) NEURON\nautomatically generated for the sections based on the connectivity\nand section lengths. In neuroConstruct a more representative 3D\nstructure for each cell was created by rotating the sections of the\nimported cells, preserving the length and section groupings, and so\nkeeping the electrical behavior of the cells the same (Figure S2B).\nAll 14 cell types were converted in this way and each can be\nvisualized using the neuroConstruct project (Thalamocortical.ncx)\nmentioned below. Each cell has a number of Simulation\nConfigurations associated with it showing the behavior of the cell,\nusually with a brief hyperpolarizing pulse followed by a\ndepolarizing pulse, generally based on the traces of individual cell\nbehavior in Appendix A of [15]. Traces of each of the electrically\ndistinct cells are shown in Supporting Figure S3. The closeness of\nthe traces between NEURON, GENESIS and MOOSE varied\nwith simulation time step and spatial discretisation. We used a\ncriterion that the same number of spikes should be present in each\ntrace, and that the differences in spike timing should be no more\nthan 0.5% of the simulation run time (e.g. spikes at 200 ms should\nnot differ in timing by more than 1 ms). A smaller than normal\ntimestep was required in all cases for convergence of cell behavior\nbetween NEURON, GENESIS and MOOSE. In general this\nmeant a 0.005 ms or lower timestep, whereas 0.02 ms is often used\nfor published models with these simulators. This lower than\nnormal timestep has also been required with simpler cell models\n(e.g. single compartment granule cell model, Figure 4 in [39]).\nA finer spatial discretisation was needed in all cells to minimize\nthe inherent differences in the way the simulators handle\nmorphological representations (NEURON uses cables/sections\ndivided into nseg points for numerical integration, GENESIS can\nuse symmetrical or asymmetrical cylindrical compartments,\nMOOSE uses symmetrical cylindrical compartments, see below).\nThe spatial discretisation used in the simulations can be changed in\nneuroConstruct (by visualizing the cell, clicking on any segment,\nclicking the button Edit, and selecting Remesh in the drop down\nbox, to choose a discretisation of each section which is constrained\nby a maximum electrotonic length, see http://www.neuroconstruct.\norg/docs/Glossary_gen.html#Electrotonic%20length). This value\nfor the number of internal divisions for spatial discretisation in\nneuroConstruct is mapped to nseg in NEURON sections, and, as\nmentioned in the section above on the CA1 cell, a number of\ncompartments are generated in GENESIS for these sections based\non this value, thus setting the spatial discretisation in that simulator.\nThe NeuroML Model Description Language\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 17 June 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e1000815\nIn GENESIS, there are two options for simulating compart-\nments: symmetric compartments where the axial resistance is\ndivided in two at each end of the compartment and the voltage is\neffectively calculated at the centre of the compartment, and\nasymmetrical compartments, where all of the axial resistance is at\none side and which are slightly more efficient to use in simulations.\nIdeally for matching the behavior of NEURON and GENESIS,\nsymmetrical compartments should be used, as NEURON also\ncalculates the voltage at the centers of nseg regions of the section.\nHowever, in GENESIS v2.3 there is a known bug which doesn’t\nallow use of the hsolve numerical integration method with\nsymmetrical compartments when there are compartments with\nmore than 2 child compartments (e.g. soma of pyramidal cell in\nFigure 9B). Use of hsolve is required for simulations as this is much\nfaster than the basic Exponential Euler method. That method\nwould require a much smaller dt (,0.00001 ms) for convergence of\nthe simulation. Therefore, in the simulations in Supporting Figure\nS3 (and in the network simulations in Figure 10), asymmetric\ncompartments, together with hsolve are used. This necessitated a\nmuch finer spatial discretisation of the cells (leading to a longer run\ntime for simulations). Plots showing the convergence of spike times\nfor 3 different cells are shown in Figure S4, where it is clear that the\nsymmetrical compartment simulations of NEURON and MOOSE\nconverge with coarser discretisation than GENESIS simulations\nwith asymmetric compartments.\nThe network used to illustrate a full Level 3 model in NeuroML\nis a scaled down version of the network model in [16]. Whereas\nthat network contained 1440 cells, this version contained 56 cells.\nThis was mainly due to the need for much finer spatial\ndiscretisation in the cells, a smaller timestep and the requirement\nthat the simulator will run on a single processor in all three\nsimulators. This network can be generated using simulation\nconfiguration CunninghamEtAl04_small in the associated neuro-\nConstruct project (Thalamocortical.ncx). The names of the cell\ngroups/populations are listed in Supporting Table S3. Synaptic\nmechanisms were added to the project based on the data in the\nsupplementary information in [16]. Network connections were\ncreated through the neuroConstruct GUI based on the numbers of\nconnections per cell in the original model. The total number of\nconnections between each pair of cell groups in the model are\nlisted in Supporting Table S4. The magnitude of the gap junction\nconductance was reduced by a factor of 0.7 (to 2.1 nS) to reduce\nthe tendency of the scaled down network to become over\nsynchronized. Input was added to the network in the form of\ncontinuous current injection of random amplitude to the FRB cells\n(0.15–0.25 nA), the LTS interneurons (0–0.2 nA), and the basket\nand Axoaxonic cells (0–0.02 nA). RS cells also received random\npulse inputs of 0.4 ms duration and 0.4 nS amplitude on their\naxon at a mean rate of 1 Hz. However, for the 250 ms simulation\nrun shown in Figures 10 and S5 no external pulses occurred.\nThe simulations were carried out with NEURON version 6.2\nand GENESIS v2.3, MOOSE SVN revision 1473 and neuro-\nConstruct v1.3.4.
