  "abstract": "Natural and synthetic esters are liquids characterized by insulating properties, high flash point, and biodegradability. For this reason, they are more and more often used as an alternative to conventional mineral oils. Esters are used to fill new or operating transformers previously filled with mineral oil (retrofilling). It is technically unfeasible to completely remove mineral oil from a transformer. Its small residues create with esters a mixture with features significantly different from those of the base liquids. This article presents electrostatic charging tendency (ECT) tests for mixtures of fresh and aged Trafo EN mineral oil with Envirotemp FR3 natural ester from the retrofilling point of view. Under unfavorable conditions, the flow electrification phenomenon can damage the solid insulation in transformers with forced oil circulation. The ECT of the insulating liquids has been specified using the volume density of the qw charge. This parameter has been determined using the Abedian–Sonin model on the basis of the electrification current measured in the flow system, as well as selected physicochemical properties of the liquids. It was shown that ECT is strongly dependent on the type of insulating liquid and pipe material, as well as the composition of the mixtures. The most important finding from the research is that a small amount (up to 10%) of fresh and aged mineral oil is effective in reducing the ECT of Envirotemp FR3 natural ester.",
