  "abstract": "Cloud recognition is a basic task in ground meteorological observation. It is of great significance to accurately identify cloud types from long-time-series satellite cloud images for improving the reliability and accuracy of weather forecasting. However, different from ground-based cloud images with a small observation range and easy operation, satellite cloud images have a wider cloud coverage area and contain more surface features. Hence, it is difficult to effectively extract the structural shape, area size, contour shape, hue, shadow and texture of clouds through traditional deep learning methods. In order to analyze the regional cloud type characteristics effectively, we construct a China region meteorological satellite cloud image dataset named CRMSCD, which consists of nine cloud types and the clear sky (cloudless). In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model, UATNet, which can realize the pixel-level classification of meteorological satellite cloud images. Our model efficiently integrates the spatial and multi-channel information of clouds. Specifically, several transformer blocks with modified self-attention computation (swin transformer blocks) and patch merging operations are used to build a hierarchical transformer, and spatial displacement is introduced to construct long-distance cross-window connections. In addition, we introduce a Channel Cross fusion with Transformer (CCT) to guide the multi-scale channel fusion, and design an Attention-based Squeeze and Excitation (ASE) to effectively connect the fused multi-scale channel information to the decoder features. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieved 82.33% PA, 67.79% MPA, 54.51% MIoU and 70.96% FWIoU on CRMSCD. Compared with the existing models, our method produces more precise segmentation performance, which demonstrates its superiority on meteorological satellite cloud recognition tasks.",
