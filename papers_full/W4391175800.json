    "abstract": "Background Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in the AI domain owing to their exemplary context recognition and response capabilities. However, the potential of LLMs in specific clinical scenarios, particularly in breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and care, has not been fully explored. This study aimed to compare the performances of three major LLMs in the clinical context of breast cancer. Methods In this study, clinical scenarios designed specifically for breast cancer were segmented into five pivotal domains (nine cases): assessment and diagnosis, treatment decision-making, postoperative care, psychosocial support, and prognosis and rehabilitation. The LLMs were used to generate feedback for various queries related to these domains. For each scenario, a panel of five breast cancer specialists, each with over a decade of experience, evaluated the feedback from LLMs. They assessed feedback concerning LLMs in terms of their quality, relevance, and applicability. Results There was a moderate level of agreement among the raters ( Fleiss’ kappa =0.345, P &lt;0.05). Comparing the performance of different models regarding response length, GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5 provided relatively longer feedback than Claude2. Furthermore, across the nine case analyses, GPT-4.0 significantly outperformed the other two models in average quality, relevance, and applicability. Within the five clinical areas, GPT-4.0 markedly surpassed GPT-3.5 in the quality of the other four areas and scored higher than Claude2 in tasks related to psychosocial support and treatment decision-making. Conclusion This study revealed that in the realm of clinical applications for breast cancer, GPT-4.0 showcases not only superiority in terms of quality and relevance but also demonstrates exceptional capability in applicability, especially when compared to GPT-3.5. Relative to Claude2, GPT-4.0 holds advantages in specific domains. With the expanding use of LLMs in the clinical field, ongoing optimization and rigorous accuracy assessments are paramount.",
