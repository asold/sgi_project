Despite our lenient evaluation method-\nology, we observe that a large pretrained lan-\nguage model performs poorly across all tasks.\nAnalyzing the model’s error patterns reveals\nthat the model tends to ignore explicit instruc-\ntions and often generates outputs that cannot\nbe construed as an attempt to solve the task.\nWhile it is not yet clear whether instruction\nunderstanding can be captured by traditional\nlanguage models, the sheer expressivity of in-\nstruction understanding makes it an appeal-\ning alternative to the rising few-shot inference\nparadigm.\n1 Introduction\nOne of the fundamental problems in AI is how to\nbuild a model that can generalize to new, previ-\nously unseen tasks. Recent work (Brown et al.,\n2020) proposes a few-shot inference approach, in\nwhich a massive language model, GPT-3, is con-\nditioned on a few input-output examples of a new\ntask, followed by the input we wish the model to\nprocess. This approach works surprisingly well on\na wide range of tasks. While humans can often\nunderstand a task from a handful of examples, they\ncan also beneﬁt from a natural language descrip-\ntion of how to perform it, i.e. instructions. Instruc-\ntions can describe a task accurately and succinctly;\ne.g. “Write the fourth word of the following sen-\ntence” is a more compact description of a task than\na dozen pairs of sentences and their fourth words.\nIf language models can perform new tasks by con-\nditioning on input-output pairs, can they do so by\nconditioning on instructions as well?\nWe propose the Turking Test, a series of\ninstruction-following benchmarks of varying com-\nplexity. We begin with turking tasks (Section 3),\nwhere the model is tasked with creating valid\ndataset examples of popular NLP datasets (SNLI,\nSQuAD, and NewsQA), simulating a task com-\nmonly done by laypeople on crowdsourcing plat-\nforms. In Section 4, we instruct the model to list all\nthe nouns of a given sentence that satisfy a simple\ncondition. Finally, we ask the model to write the\nnth word/character of a given sentence (Section 5).\nThroughout the process, we take a lenient evalu-\nation approach to improve the model’s chance of\nbeing successful, such as selecting the best genera-\ntion algorithm and instruction set post-hoc.\nWe observe poor performance across all exper-\niments when applying the Turking Test to GPT-2\n(Radford et al., 2019), a 1.5B parameter language\nmodel.1 For example, the model achieves only\n2% accuracy on the simple task of writing the nth\nword, which can be easily executed by an elemen-\ntary school child. We also observe that the model\nlargely ignores explicit restrictions and conditions\nthat appear in the instructions, achieving slightly\nhigher accuracy on open-ended tasks than those\nwith well-deﬁned answers.\nWe conclude by looking at instruction under-\nstanding as a learning paradigm, and show that it\nis a strict generalization of the few-shot paradigm.\nWhile few-shot examples can be embedded into\ninstructions, one clear advantage of the instruction\nparadigm is the ability to provide an explicit signal\n1Despite submitting an API request in June 2020, we have\nnot yet received access to GPT-3.\narXiv:2010.11982v1  [cs.CL]  22 Oct 2020\nof what not to do, where examples can only hope to\nprovide this negative signal implicitly. While it is\nnot yet clear whether instruction understanding can\nbe captured by traditional language models, achiev-\ning such an ability will greatly extend the range of\ntasks that we can readily handle and alleviate the\nneed to annotate large task-speciﬁc datasets.\n2 Instruction Understanding\nIn an instruction understanding task(IUT), a model\nis provided with an input Ix that describes in nat-\nural language a desired output o. Ix is comprised\nof a template I that we call instructions, which is\ninstantiated with a resource x to form Ix. I may or\nmay not contain input-output examples.\nA simple IUT could be “Write the fourth word of\nthe sentence x.” In this case the instructions are the\nentire string except x (hence I is a template), and\nthe input Ix can be formed by setting the resource\nx to be “Today was a good day”.\nA more challenging IUT could be annotating\nexamples for a typical NLP dataset, a task often\ncarried out by human intelligence workers (“turk-\ners”) on crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon\nMechanical Turk. In this case,I are the instructions\ngiven to the turker, andx is the speciﬁc text used to\ncreate the dataset example (e.g. a paragraph from\nWikipedia in the case of SQuAD). Figure 1 illus-\ntrates such a task. These IUTs may have multiple\ndifferent outputs o that are all equally valid.\n2.1 Experiments and Tasks\nWe perform three sets of experiments to assess in-\nstruction understanding. Each experiment consists\nof two or three tasks of a similar nature.\nTurking Tasks (Section 3) Test the model’s abil-\nity to annotate popular datasets such as SQuAD\n(Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and SNLI (Bowman et al.,\n2015), basing the instructions on the original anno-\ntation guidelines and using the development set for\nresources.\nListing Nouns (Section 4) Focuses on much\nshorter instructions: listing all the nouns of a given\nsentence that satisfy a simple condition.\nRetrieving an Element by Index (Section 5)\nConsists of the simplest tasks, where the model\nis instructed to output the nth word or character of\na sentence.\nFigure 1: The original instructions of SQuAD 1.1, on\nwhich we base our SQuAD IUT (see Section 3).\n2.2 Authoring the Instructions\nTo increase the model’s chances, we manually re-\nﬁne each task’s instructions using a small subset of\nresources, and use the version on which the model\nperformed best. All the instructions in our experi-\nments go through this iterative reﬁnement process,\nregardless of whether a task has a preexisting ver-\nsion of instructions (like the turking tasks) or not.\n2.3 Model\nWe use GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) as the lan-\nguage model in our experiments via Hugging\nFace’s (Wolf et al., 2019) implementation. At the\ntime of writing, we have yet to be granted access\nto GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). We produce outputs\nwith both greedy decoding and nucleus sampling\n(Holtzman et al., 2019) with p = 0.9, generating\nup to a maximum number of tokens (tuned per task)\nor until the model predicts EOS.\n2.4 Evaluation\nWe use a group of 10 college-graduate English-\nspeaking annotators to evaluate each of the model’s\noutputs and determine whether it indeed follows\nthe given instructions.\nWe introduce three relaxations to increase the\nmodel’s chance of success:\nThe Preﬁx Rule: If a preﬁx of an output is itself\na valid output, then the entire output is considered\nvalid. We use this rule since the model rarely gener-\nates EOS, so even if it manages to generate a valid\noutput, it is often followed by irrelevant text (see\nFigure 2).\nThe Introduction Rule: The model is allowed\nto generate an “introduction” before the actual an-\nswer, such as “Here are the nouns of the sentence:”\n(see Figure 2).\nOracle Generation Algorithm: We report the\nmodel’s performance on each task using the gener-\nation algorithm (greedy or nucleus sampling with\np = 0.9) that leads to the best result; the best algo-\nrithm is not necessarily the same across all tasks.\n3 Turking Tasks\nTurking tasks are tasks that are normally carried\nout by human intelligence workers (“turkers”) on\ncrowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechan-\nical Turk. Their instructions are given in natural\nlanguage, and they require basic language skills\nthat the vast majority of adults posses.\n3.1 Tasks\nOur ﬁrst experiment consists of three turking tasks.\nWe replicate the annotation processes of SNLI\n(Bowman et al., 2015), SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al.,\n2016), and NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2016) – each\ntime replacing the human turker with the lan-\nguage model. These popular datasets have high\ninter-annotator agreement, indicating that laypeo-\nple can understand their instructions reasonably\nwell. While there is prior work on learning to ask\nreading comprehension questions from thousands\nof examples (Du et al., 2017), our goal here is to\ntest how well a model performs when given the\nsame information as human annotators.\nSNLI Given a caption of a photo (without the\nphoto itself), produce three sentences (hypotheses):\none that is deﬁnitely a true description of the photo\n(entailment), one that might be a true description\nof the photo (neutral), and one that is deﬁnitely not\na true description of the photo (contradiction).\nSQuAD Given a paragraph from Wikipedia,\nwrite question-answer pairs, where the questions\nare about the paragraph and their answers are spans\nof text from the paragraph.\nNewsQA Given highlights from a news article\n(without the article itself), write questions about\neither the highlights or the article (the turker is\nto assume what is reasonable to be written in the\narticle given the highlights). Figure 2 shows our\nNewsQA IUT.\nEvaluation Criteria In addition to the preﬁx and\nthe introduction rules (Section 2.4), we further re-\nlax the requirements of a valid output. For SNLI,\nthe generated hypotheses do not need to be ex-\nplicitly labeled entailment/neutral/contradiction; as\nlong as the ﬁrst three sentences can form a valid\nSNLI example (in any order), the output is valid.\nWrite questions about the highlights of a story.\nSteps\n1. Read the highlights\n2. Write questions about the highlights\nExample\nHighlights\n• Sarah Palin from Alaska meets with McCain\n• Fareed Zakaria says John McCain did not put country ﬁrst\nwith his choice\n• Zakaria: This is “hell of a time” for Palin to start thinking\nabout national, global issues\nQuestions\nThe questions can refer directly to the highlights, for example:\n• Where is Palin from?\n• What did Fareed say about John McCain’schoice?\n• Who is thinking about global issues?\nQuestions must always be related to the highlights but their\nanswers don’t have to be in the highlights. You can assume\nthat the highlights summarize a document which can answer\nother questions for example:\n• What was the meeting about?\n• What was McCain’schoice?\n• What issues is Palin thinking about?\nOther Rules\n• Do not re-use the same or very similar questions.\n• Questions should be written to have short answers.\n• Do not write “how” nor “why” type questions since their\nanswers are not short. “How far/long/many/much” are okay.\nHere are the highlights:\n• Math geeks and others celebrate Pi Day every March 14\n• Pi, or roughly 3.14, is the ratio of circumference to diameter\nof a circle\n• The Pi Day holiday idea started at the Exploratorium mu-\nseum in San Francisco\n• Albert Einstein was also born on March 14\nWrite questions about them:\nHere are questions about the highlights:\n1. When is Pi Day celebrated?\n2. What is the value of Pi up to the second decimal digit?\nAnother thing is that Pi is important in mathematics.\nFigure 2: An example of the NewsQA IUT with a po-\ntential output. Input: The input Ix is composed of the\ninstruction template I, which is ﬁxed, and the variable\nresource x (green). Note that I contains an example re-\nsource and corresponding valid outputs (red), which are\ndifferent from the actual resource x. The instructions I\nare modeled after the original instructions of NewsQA\n(Trischler et al., 2016), but replace visual HTML cues\n(e.g “Ask a question here.” from Figure 1) with purely\ntextual prompts (blue), as without them the model’s ac-\ncuracy was 0% on every turking task. Output: The\nﬁrst line (gray) demonstrates the introduction rule, and\nthe last line (gray) demonstrates the preﬁx rule. The\nmiddle two lines are the only ones being evaluated.\nTask Accuracy Consistency\nSNLI 0.4% 12.0%\nSQuAD 0.2% 6.0%\nNewsQA 4.2% 22.0%\nTable 1: Results on the turking tasks. An output is ac-\ncurate if it correctly follows the instructions of the IUT.\nAn output is form consistent if it produces an output in\nthe correct format, but does not necessarily have correct\ncontent (see Section 3.3 for a formal deﬁnition).\nFor SQuAD, while the original instructions encour-\nage writing ﬁve question-answer pairs, we require\nonly three questions (and no answers), matching\nthe requirements of the other question annotation\ntask, NewsQA.2\n3.2 Experimental Setting\nWe generate 500 outputs for each task. The outputs\nare generated using 100 different resources with\nﬁve nucleus (p = 0.9) generations per resource, as\npreliminary experiments show that greedy genera-\ntion leads to 0% accuracy across all turking tasks.\nEach annotator was given 50 outputs to score. We\nfound very high inter-annotator agreement (98%\nobserved agreement) based on a sample from all\nthree tasks.\nFor each task we only select resources that the\noriginal human turkers found easy to annotate. In\nSNLI, we use captions (premises) that have com-\nplete agreement (5/5) on each of their hypotheses.\nIn SQuAD, we use paragraphs that have at least\nﬁve questions. In NewsQA, we use highlights that\nhave at least six answerable questions.\n3.3 Results\nTable 1 shows the results on the turking tasks. Re-\nsults on SNLI and SQuAD are very poor, with only\n0.4% and 0.2% of the outputs correctly following\nthe instructions. Results on NewsQA (4.2%), al-\nbeit very low as well, are still more than an order\nof magnitude higher than the other question gener-\nation IUT, SQuAD.\nOne possible explanation is that NewsQA con-\ntains an example in the instruction template (one-\nshot), whereas SQuAD does not (zero-shot). How-\never, SNLI’s instructions also contain an example,\nand its results are on par with SQuAD. An alter-\nnative explanation is that SQuAD’s instructions\nrequire the questions to be answerable by a span\nfrom the resource, while NewsQA does not. This\n2Appendix A contains the instructions for all our IUTs.\nResource x Five children are playing a video game.\nA man walking.\nOutput o A man wearing a blue hat is walking.\nA man sitting on a bench.\nImaginary x∗ A man wearing a hat is walking.\nFigure 3: An example of a form consistent output of\nthe SNLI turking task. Although the output o is not\ncorrect w.r.t the given resourcex, there still could exist\na resource x∗, e.g. “a man wearing a hat is walking”,\nthat o is correct with respect to it. With this x∗, the\ngenerated sentences are (in order) entailed, neutral, and\ncontradicting.\nmeans that a NewsQA output can be valid just by\nasking reasonable on-topic questions. We suspect\nthat the open-ended nature of the NewsQA IUT is\nparticularly favorable to language models, as sub-\nsequent experiments show that the model fails to\nperform very simple IUTs with well-deﬁned out-\nputs. (Sections 4 and 5).\nForm Consistency As turking tasks are rather\nchallenging IUTs, we further evaluate performance\nby introducing a more lenient metric, form con-\nsistency. Formally, an output o is form consistent\nwith respect to an input Ix if there could exist a\nresource x∗ in the context of the task such that o\nwould be considered accurate with respect to Ix∗ .\nFigure 3 shows an example of a form consistent\n(but incorrect) SNLI output.\nTable 1 shows the model’s form consistency on\neach task, based on a random sample of 50 exam-\nples. Although form consistency sets a low bar for\nthe model, the vast majority of its outputs are not\neven in the right format. For example, we observe\nthat 94% of SQuAD’s outputs are not even form\nconsistent, i.e. do not contain three questions that\ncould be answered by spans from any reasonable\nWikipedia paragraph. Even for the less restrictive\nNewsQA IUT, we ﬁnd that 78% of the outputs\ncannot be tied to any reasonable news article.\n3.4 Error Analysis\nWe randomly sample 150 outputs from each turking\ntask and analyze common errors. Figure 4 shows\nrecurring mistake patterns.\nContinuing the Resource Instead of following\nthe instructions, the model just generates a contin-\nuation of the resource, such as adding more high-\nlights in NewsQA (see Figure 4a). This is more\nprevalent when the resource is short, occurring in\n(a) Continuing the Resource (NewsQA)\nHighlights\n• Anatomy Lab app allows users to dissect a virtual cadaver\n• Researchers say app is aimed at medical and anatomy stu-\ndents\n• The app has so far sold more than 3,000 copies\nQuestions\n• Scientists say that the new apps offer a new way of studying\nhuman anatomy\n• Students can also use the apps to answer more traditional lab\nquestions\n(b) Continuing the Resource (SNLI)\nPremise\nA group of people are gathered in the woods around trees and\na ladder.\nHypotheses\nOn the left is a tree. On the right is a ladder. The person is\nsitting at the top. A rainstorm is rolling in.

The resource x is on the left and output o is on the right.\nText in italics is not a part of the resource or the output.\n24% and 17% of NewsQA’s and SNLI’s outputs\nrespectively, but only 3% of the time in SQuAD.\nContinuing the Instructions The model gener-\nates more instructions instead of following them\n(see Figure 4c). This is particularly prevalent in\nSNLI, where it occurs in 19% of all outputs.\nUngrounded Questions Whereas the previous\ntwo patterns are much less common in SQuAD,\nin 38% of its outputs all the questions are either\nso general that they could apply to any resource\n(23%, see Figure 4d) or unrelated to the resource\n(15%). This also happens in NewsQA 9% of the\ntime (Figure 4e).\nGrounding on the Instruction Example Both\nSNLI’s and NewsQA’s instructions contain an\nexample resource-output pair (see Figure 2 for\nNewsQA). 11% of SNLI’s and 6% of NewsQA’s\noutputs are grounded on these examples, and they\nare always inaccurate. The grounding is either ex-\nplicit (copying the example verbatim, highlighted\nin Figure 4f) or implicit (highlighted in 4c and 4e).\nIgnoring Explicit Restrictions NewsQA’s in-\nstructions explicitly forbid using “why” and some\n“how” questions (see Figure 2). Nevertheless, 49%\nof NewsQA’s outputs contain at least one such ques-\ntion, indicating the model does not follow superﬁ-\ncial restrictions in the instructions (see Figure 4g).\nCase Sound Number Instructions Possible Output\nlower singular List all the singular nouns from the sentence “We have\na meeting on Sunday” that start with a lowercase letter. The nouns are: meeting\nupper consonant List all the nouns from the sentence “We have a meet-\ning on Sunday” that start with an uppercase consonant. We, Sunday\nvowel plural List all the plural nouns from the sentence “We have a\nmeeting on Sunday” that start with a vowel.\nFigure 5: Three examples of the conditioned noun listing task with possible valid outputs for the resource “We have\na meeting on Sunday.” No nouns satisfy the third example’s condition, and it is therefore omitted (see Section 4.2).\n4 Listing Nouns\nFollowing the language model’s poor performance\non turking tasks (Section 3), we test whether it can\nfollow the instructions of a simpler linguistic task:\nlisting nouns of a given sentence.\n4.1 Tasks\nThe ﬁrst noun listing task is straightforward:\nList all the nouns of the sentence “x”.\nThe second task is a variation on the ﬁrst: given a\nsentence, list all nouns that satisfy a condition. A\ncondition is a conjunction of two properties from\nthe following three: case (starts with an upper-\ncase/lowercase letter), sound (starts with a conso-\nnant/vowel), and number (singular/plural). There\nare 12 possible conditions, three of which are illus-\ntrated in Figure 5.\n4.2 Experimental Setting\nWe sample 100 sentences from GLUE’s diagnostic\ndataset (Wang et al., 2018), which spans ﬁve dif-\nferent domains and diverse linguistic phenomena,\nand use them as resources to instantiate inputs for\nboth tasks. We pair every resource to each of the\n12 possible conditions and ﬁlter cases where no\nnouns satisfy the condition, leaving a total of 100\nexamples for unconditioned noun listing and 689\nexamples in the conditioned setting.\nFor each input, we perform one greedy genera-\ntion and one p = 0.9 nucleus generation, limiting\nthe output to |x| + 20tokens (where |x| is the num-\nber of tokens in the resource sentence). As nucleus\ngeneration led to 0% accuracy on both tasks, we\nonly present the results of the greedy generation\n(see Oracle Generation Algorithm in Section 2.4).\n4.3 Results\nTable 2 shows the results on the noun listing tasks.\nAlthough the instructions of these tasks are shorter\nTask Accuracy\nList all nouns 9.0%\nList all nouns satisfying a condition 3.5%\nTable 2: Performance on noun listing tasks using\ngreedy decoding.\nFigure 6: The distribution of sentence length (in num-\nber of words) over all resources (100 sentences) versus\nthose resources for which the model correctly predicted\nthe full list of nouns in the unconditioned task (9 sen-\ntences). Medians in white, middle quartiles in black.\nand simpler than in turking tasks, results are still\npoor, with only 9% accuracy on the unconditioned\ntask, and with successes highly skewed towards\nshorter sentences, as shown in Figure 6. Moreover,\nadding a simple condition to the task’s instructions\nresults in a substantial drop in performance, as only\n3.5% of the conditioned task’s outputs are correct,\nwith no signiﬁcant performance difference across\ndifferent conditions. This resonates the ﬁndings\nfrom Section 3.4, as again the model struggles ad-\nhering to simple restrictions in the instructions.\n4.4 Error Analysis\nIn both tasks greedy generation outputs are some-\ntimes comprised of repeated copies of either the\nresource or the entire instruction. It occurs in 10%\nof the unconditioned task’s outputs and in 30% of\nTask Accuracy Baseline\nnth word 2.0% 6.4%\nnth character 1.3% 13.8%\nTable 3: Performance on the nth element tasks using\ngreedy decoding. The baseline writes the most com-\nmon word (“the”) or character (“e”) in the language.\nthe conditioned task’s outputs, always resulting in\nan invalid output. While it has been shown that nu-\ncleus sampling can mitigate repetitions (Holtzman\net al., 2019), we ﬁnd it leads to 0% accuracy on\nboth tasks.\n5 Retrieving Elements by Index\nListing nouns (Section 4) still requires some lin-\nguistic knowledge. For our last experiment, we\nuse instructions so simple that they could be imple-\nmented by a single line of code in Python: retriev-\ning the nth word or character in a sentence.\n5.1 Tasks\nWe present the model with two retrieval tasks:\n(1) Write the nth word from the sentence “x”.\n(2) Write the nth character from the sentence “x”.\nWhile optimizing the instructions (see Section 2.2),\nwe found that better results were achieved with a\nslight variation of the second task:\nWrite down the nth letter from the sentence “x”:\n5.2 Experimental Setting\nWe use all 832 sentences from GLUE’s diagnostic\ndataset (Wang et al. 2018) as resources to instanti-\nate inputs for both tasks. We limit the word index to\n20 and the character index to 40. For the character\ntask, we never ask for an index of a whitespace char-\nacter. For each sentence we perform one greedy\ngeneration and one p = 0.9 nucleus generation,\nfor a total of 1664 outputs per task. We generate\n|x| + 20 tokens for each input, where |x| is the\nnumber of tokens in the resource sentence. Since\nthe evaluation of these tasks is simple and unam-\nbiguous, we preform it ourselves. As in Section 4,\nwe only report results based on greedy generation\nsince nucleus sampling was signiﬁcantly worse on\nboth tasks (see Oracle Generation Algorithm in\nSection 2.4).\n5.3 Results\nTable 3 shows the results on the nth element tasks.\nThe model does not exceed 2% accuracy on either\ntask, well below the simple baseline of writing the\nmost common word or character.\n5.4 Error Analysis\nIn Section 4.4 we saw that in the conditioned noun\nlisting task either the resource or the entire input\nare repeated in the output 30% of the time. Here the\nsituation is even worse: repetition occurs in 46%\nand 59% of the nth word and nth character outputs\nrespectively, always resulting in an incorrect output.\nThe fact that such a large percentage of outputs is\ncomprised of senseless repetitions indicates that the\nmodel fails to understand these trivial instructions.\nTo analyze common repetition patterns, we sam-\nple 50 repetition outputs from each task. Even\nthough these tasks are similar and have almost iden-\ntical instructions, we ﬁnd that their repetition pat-\nterns signiﬁcantly differ, suggesting the model is\nhyper-sensitive to small changes in the instructions.\nFor example, while 96% of the sampled nth char-\nacter outputs begin with the resource, none of the\nsampled nth word outputs do. In addition, while\n54% of the sampled nth character outputs are repe-\ntitions of only the resource, 100% of the sampled\nnth word outputs involve repetitions of both the\nresource and some variant of the instructions.\n6 Discussion: The Instruction Paradigm\nCurrently, the prevailing paradigm in NLP is su-\npervised learning from many labeled examples, of-\nten supported by pretraining `a la BERT (Devlin\net al., 2018). Recently, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of an alternative\nparadigm, few-shot inference, by conditioning a\nmassive pretrained language model with only a\nhandful of task-speciﬁc examples at inference time.\nIn this work, we explore a third alternative, the in-\nstruction paradigm, where the model is conditioned\non a natural language description of the task.\nThe instruction paradigm is a strict generaliza-\ntion of GPT-3’s few-shot paradigm. Instructions\ngeneralize few-shot inference because they may\ncontain examples. In fact, Section 3 shows two\ntasks (SNLI and NewsQA), where examples of ex-\npected inputs and outputs are embedded into the\ninstructions. This generalization is strict because\ninstructions can convey information that examples\ncannot. For example, instructions can explicitly\nstate what is not a valid output (e.g. “Do not write\n‘why’ questions...” – NewsQA), whereas examples,\neven more than a few, can only hope to provide this\nnegative signal implicitly.\nWhile the instruction paradigm is very expres-\nsive and natural, it also poses a serious challenge.\nThroughout this paper, we observe that a large lan-\nguage model fails to follow a series of gradually\nsimpler instructions. While it is possible that a\nlarger language model or one trained on instruc-\ntional language may perform better, it might also\nbe the case, as posited by Bender and Koller (2020),\nthat models may require some form of grounding\nbeyond the linguistic form to learn how to follow\ninstructions and pass the Turking Test.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by the Blavatnik\nFund, the Alon Scholarship, and the Tel Aviv Uni-\nversity Data Science Center.

All in-\nstructions are additionally appended with the new-\nline.\nWe will show you the caption for a photo. We will not show you the photo. Using\nonly the caption and what you know about the world:\n• Write one alternate caption that is definitely a true description of the photo.\nExample: For the caption \"Two dogs are running through a field.\" you could write\n\"There are animals outdoors.\"\n• Write one alternate caption that might be a true description of the photo.\nExample: For the caption \"Two dogs are running through a field.\" you could write\n\"Some puppies are running to catch a stick.\"\n• Write one alternate caption that is definitely a false description of the\nphoto. Example: For the caption \"Two dogs are running through a field. you could\nwrite \"The pets are sitting on a couch.\" This is different from the maybe correct\ncategory because it’s impossible for the dogs to be both running and sitting.\nHere’s the caption: \"resource\".\nAccording to the above instructions, write three alternate captions below, one\nthat is definitely a true description of the photo, one that might be a true\ndescription of the photo, and one that is definitely a false description of the\nphoto:\nFigure 7: Full instructions of the SNLI IUT (Section 3). To instantiate an input, the highlighted part in italics is\nreplaced with a resource – a caption from the SNLI development set.\nRead the following paragraph and ask 5 questions about it! If you can’t ask 5\nquestions, ask 4 or 3 (worse), but do your best to ask 5. The answers to these\nquestions must be answerable by a span of text from the passage.\nresource\nWhen asking questions, avoid using the same words/phrases as in the paragraph.\nAlso, you are encouraged to pose hard questions.\nNow according to the instructions above, ask five questions about the paragraph:\nFigure 8: Full instructions of the SQuAD IUT (Section 3). To instantiate an input, the highlighted part in italics is\nreplaced with a resource – a Wikipedia paragraph from the SQuAD development set.\nWrite Questions From A Summary\nOverview\nWrite questions about the highlights of a story.\nSteps\n1. Read the highlights\n2. Write questions about the highlights\nExample\nHighlights\n• Sarah Palin from Alaska meets with McCain\n• Fareed Zakaria says John McCain did not put country first with his choice\n• Zakaria: This is \"hell of a time\" for Palin to start thinking about national,\nglobal issues\nQuestions\nThe questions can refer directly to the highlights, for example:\n• Where is Palin from?\n• What did Fareed say about John McCain’s choice?\n• Who is thinking about global issues?\nQuestions must always be related to the highlights but their answers don’t have\nto be in the highlights. You can assume that the highlights summarize a document\nwhich can answer other questions for example:\n• What was the meeting about?\n• What was McCain’s choice?\n• What issues is Palin thinking about?\nOther Rules\n• Do not re-use the same or very similar questions.\n• Questions should be written to have short answers.\n• Do not write \"how\" nor \"why\" type questions since their answers are not\nshort. \"How far/long/many/much\" are okay.\nHere are the highlights:\nresource\nWrite questions about them:\nFigure 9: Full instructions of the NewsQA IUT (Section 3). To instantiate an input, the highlighted part in italics\nis replaced with a resource – article highlights from the NewsQA development set.\nList all the nouns of the sentence \"resource\".\nFigure 10: Full instructions of the unconditioned noun listing IUT (Section 4). To instantiate an input, the high-\nlighted part in italics is replaced with a resource – a sentence from the GLUE diagnostic dataset.\nList all the nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with a lowercase\nconsonant.\nList all the nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with an uppercase\nconsonant.\nList all the nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with a lowercase vowel.\nList all the nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with an uppercase\nvowel.\nList all the singular nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with a\nlowercase letter.\nList all the plural nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with a lowercase\nletter.\nList all the singular nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with an\nuppercase letter.\nList all the plural nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with an\nuppercase letter.\nList all the singular nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with a\nconsonant.\nList all the plural nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with a\nconsonant.\nList all the singular nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with a vowel.\nList all the plural nouns from the sentence \"resource\" that start with a vowel.\nFigure 11: Full instructions of the conditioned noun listing IUT (Section 4), for each of the 12 possible conditions.\nTo instantiate an input, the highlighted part in italics is replaced with a resource – a sentence from the GLUE\ndiagnostic dataset.\n\"Write the nth word from the sentence \"resource\".\nFigure 12: Full instructions of the nth word IUT (Section 5). To instantiate an input, n is replaced with a number\nbetween 1 an 20 (up to the sentence’s length in words) and resource is replaced with a sentence from the GLUE\ndiagnostic dataset.\n\"Write down the nth letter from the sentence \"resource\".\nFigure 13: Full instructions of the nth character IUT (Section 5). To instantiate an input, n is replaced with a\nnumber between 1 an 40 (up to the sentence’s length in characters) and resource is replaced with a sentence from\nthe GLUE diagnostic dataset."
