  "abstract": "On-Load Tap Changer(OLTC) transformer with adaptive voltage regulation is the common used method of voltage control in power grid. The study on the switching process of OLTC shows that the transition process is dependent on the structure of the load voltage regulating switch. In this paper, the related equivalent circuit and the calculation formula of the impact current are given. Aiming at the problem of transition state switching in OLTC, a tap-changer control method without transition state is proposed and simulated with inductive load. We have given the electrical main circuit and the measured waveforms of no transition state voltage regulation. We use MCT801D intelligent module to develop a non-contact voltage regulator power supply, which can switch taps rapidly under inductive load, and the output current is continuous without impact.",
