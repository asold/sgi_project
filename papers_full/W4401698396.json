    "abstract": "ChatGPT4-RAG significantly advances anticoagulation management in endoscopic procedures, offering reliable and precise medical guidance. However, medicolegal considerations mean that a 75% full accuracy rate remains inadequate for independent clinical decision-making. AI may be more appropriately utilized to support and confirm clinicians' decisions, rather than replace them. Further evaluation is essential to maintain patient confidentiality and the integrity of the physician-patient relationship.",
