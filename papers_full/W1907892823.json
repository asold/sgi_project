The windings of transformers that have \nalready grown old and are intended for liquidation are \nmethodically used for his purpose.  Described work is focused on \nobservation of changes in paper insulation’s utility characteristic, \ndegree of polymerization DP and tensile strength R (MPa), \ndepending on the operating conditions and age of a device. At \nsame time these information are confronted with a content of \nfuranic substances and CO, CO\n2 that are products of cellulosic \nmaterials’ disintegration in oil filling of a device, if they are \navailable.  \nTheoretical and partly also empirical relationships between \nlevels of these substances that are contained in oil and the \ndegree of polymerization DP are known in publications. For \npractical application of relationa l recalculation in real practice \nit is necessary to look into factors that are affecting the \ncontent of furans and their variability which follows from \noperating interventions in oil filling, operating conditions and \noperational utilization of a transformer. As unlike the content \nof furanic substances the direct monitoring of DP is not \npossible with the devices during their running, the effort to \nprove expected relations and mutual relationships in the aging \nprocess in transformers leads us to monitoring of the state of \npaper insulations (using DP and tensile strength R) in \ntransformers meant for disposal or in overhauled transformers \nand to seeking relationships w ith their construction, operating \nhistory, results of DGA and content of furanic substances. \nManuscript received on 20 October 2014, in final form 9 March 2015, \naccepted 3 April 2015. \n2380  E. Müllerová et al.: Life Cycle Management of Powe r Transformers: Results and Discussion of Case Studies  \nObserved indicators of the aging of insulation system’s \npaper components seem from this point of view as basic \nimportant information even though such a complex problem \nlike residual service life of transformers cannot be solved by \nthese indicators completely. The reason behind it is mainly the \nfact that critical localities of insulation system are inaccessible \nduring the whole operating life and the localities which are \nrelatively accessible do not pr ovide enough information on \nreal state of insulation in crucial localities. Therefore the \nmeaning of extensive analyses performed on insulations of \ndemounted devices is cogniti on of mutual relationships \nbetween the state of insula tion from relatively accessible \nplaces and the state of insula tion from other places of the \nsystem.  \n2 PROBLEMS OF ESTIMATE OF THE PAPER \nINSULATION’S STATE, CHOSEN METHOD \nSystematic observation of the state of paper parts in \ninsulations system of transformers meant to disposal or of \noverhauled transformers following the set of other information \nfrom the operating life of a device (operating history, \ninterventions in oil filling, DGA, content of degradation \nproducts in oil, furans) has two aspects in this case: \n• Achieved database is a source of data for a verification of \nthe method which is related with an estimation of residual \nservice life of running transforme rs, if there is possibility of \nobtaining a sample of paper insulation from assessed \ntransformers (prearranged sample that is possible to take or a \nsample from terminal conduc tors during a necessary \ninspecting interventions into the inner environment of a \ndevice).      \n• Simultaneously these data are at disposal for use \naccording to the needs of operators for comparison of \navailable data from running devices with parameters of \ntransformers whose state of paper insulation was analytically \nproved and whose comparable data from their running history \nare known. The significance of this use grows especially in \nthe case that integral sample of paper insulation is not \navailable during the running of an assessed device. \nEssential condition for an estimation of residual service life \nof a device is determination of criterial quantity and value \ndetermining the end of secure and reliable running of a device.   \nFrom the point of view of operating capability we classify the \nposition of insulation system of a device as dominant. The \nquantity of degree of polymerization DP was chosen as a \ncriterial, this quantity proporti onally determines degradation \nchanges in binding structure of cellulose. Generally \nrecognized physical limit of analy tical quantity DP is 200, the \ndecrease bellow this value repres ent theoretical end of service \nlife of device’s paper insulation. \nThe determining factor is a complexity of an environment \nin which the degradation is taking place. Specifically it is \nexistence of localities of critical aging within the insulation \nsystem (in winding) which are difficultly perceptible by levels \nof general degradation factors. Therefore it is necessary to \nseek a method for an estimation of device’s residual service \nlife that would at least par tially proceed from specific and \nrelatively available information. Proposed method of \nestimation of presumable residual service life uses practically \nthe comparison between two specific findings:  \n   \n• Integral sample:  Analytically determined DP values of \na sample of aged paper insulation of assessed device. \nSample is taken after a sufficiently long period of running \nand it is taken from the free sp ace within a device (usually \nfrom neutral terminal or from accessible paper barrier, \npreferably though from a prearranged sample). Such sample \nwe call integral sample and analyzed value of DP is called \nintegral quantity and it provi des information about overall \nenvironment’s degradation effect on paper insulation \nsystems in a device.   \n \n• Twelve analytical data: A set of analytically determined \nDP values of aged paper insulation’s samples from \ntransformers meant for disposal or for general renovation of \ntheir insulation systems.  Samples are taken from ca. 12 \nsystematically selected locations in winding, integral sample \nhas to be taken too. Set of values of DP provides information \nabout frequency of occurrence of critically degraded locations \nin winding and about the state of its paper insulation. Integral \nsample provides matched value to these samples which is \nimage of overall effect of degradation processes in a device. \nRelationship between value achieved from integral sample and \naverage of at least three lowe st values from the set of 12 \nanalytical data is called relational coefficient. Rate of \nprobability of this coefficient depends on the number of \nanalyses of liquidated insulation systems. \nMethod of an estimation of probable residual lifespan itself \nconsist in application of fitting relational coefficient on really \nanalysed integral quantity – DP value from assessed device \nand subsequent calculation of aging period until reaching of \nlimit of DP using relations (1) to (3), on condition that the \nageing process has exponential character: \n\nit\ni eDPDP\n\n 0  (1) \nDPi - value of DP which is gained by insulation during aging \n(after period ti) \nDP0 - starting value of insulation (DP of new paper) \nτ - time constant of function.  \nThen applies:   \n  ii DPDPt 0ln  (2)  \n ii DPDPt 0ln  (3) \nThe procedure of applying aforesaid method we can call \nmethodology of estimation of probable residual service life of \ndevice and it includes:    \n• sampling of integral sample from assessed device and its \nanalysis,  \n• application of suitable relational coefficient that was \nachieved from insulation systems of devices of comparable \nparameters, constructional arrangement and operating \nconditions,   \n• following calculation of a tim e until reaching limits of a \nstate of paper insulation using exponential relationships. \nSpecifically the methodical procedure can be best illustrated \non an example. We take an inte gral sample of aged insulation \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 22, No. 4; August 2015   2381  \n \nthat is a sample from a free space of general aging, after for \ninstance 15 years of running from a device whose residual \nservice life we want to estimate.  We analytically evaluate its \nDP value (for example 500) and with exponentially \nrelationships we can determine the period during which the \nintegral sample would reach the aging limit of  DP = 200 (35 \nyears from estimated starting DP\n0 = 1000). This way residual \nservice life will be calculated for example (35 – 15) = 20 \nyears. That is however time of reaching the aging limit of \nintegral sample. From experience we know that values inside \na winding of a device can be cons iderably lower.  Therefore \nwe determine probable values in winding up to DP = 357 by \napplication of suitable relationa l coefficient (for example 1.4) \nthat was discovered in devices with comparable parameters \nand operating degrada tion conditions.  Recalculated probable \nresidual service life decreases than on considerably lower \nvalue (23.5 – 15) = 8.5 years. \nObservation of amount and de velopment rate of gaseous \ndegradation products (DGA with emphasis on CO, CO\n2) and \ncontent of furanic substances in oil as a follow-up to operating \nhistory of a device should always be an inseparable part of \nmethodical processes, for two basic reasons: \n• indirect informative estimation of intensity of aging \nprocesses and with it the level of aging of insulation systems \nin transformers also from the amount and development rate of \ndegradation products, \n• opportunity of utilization of these information for more \nqualified selection of relational coefficient by comparing \nparameters of development of degradation products in \nassessed transformer with parameters of development in \ntransformers whose state of paper insulation has already been \nproved at the end of their operating existence. \n2.1 EXAMPLE OF RELATIONAL COEFFICIENTS \nCALCULATION, APPLICATION IN PRACTICE  \nTransformer T2AN is typical re presentative of transformers \nfrom producer “U” (see Table 1, Table 2): \nDP of the integral sample         860  \nAverage of three lowest values  from the set of 12 analytical \ndata from 400 kV winding        809  \nRelational coefficient          860/809 = 1.06 \nIt generally holds true for transformers from producer “U” \nthat relation coefficients are approximately 1. Transformer \nT5AL (see Table 1) is to a certain extent different from this \ntrend. \nDP of the integral sample         1027              \nAverage of three lowest values  from the set of 12 analytical \ndata from 220 kV winding        766  \nRelational coefficient for 220kV winding  1027/766 = 1.34 \nAverage of three lowest values  from the set of 12 analytical \ndata from 110 kV winding        843 \nRelational coefficient for 110kV winding  1027/843 = 1.22 \nThe device T5AL has paper insulation with high DP values \nwhich is typical for transforme rs from producer “U”. In the \ncase of this device more distinct inequality in aging of \nsamples than it is usual in transformers of this producer \nshowed up. Lowered DP values occur especially in 220 kV \n \nFigure 2.

It is always taken from the place in \nfree oil area of a tank, usually from ne utral terminal or from accessible paper \nbarrier, preferably though from a prearranged sample. Such sample can be\ntaken during running of a device as an initial one for application o f\nmethodical procedure of residual service life’s estimation. \n \nFigure 1.

The \nsamples was analyzed accordi ng to standard IEC60567 (DP) \nand ISO1924-2 (R) in accredited laboratory. The values of \nDGA and furans concentration in oil used as information \nadditional to the case studies  are the accredited laboratory \ndata. The sampling and analysis were made according to \nstandards IEC60567 (DGA) and IEC61198 (2FAL).  \n \n3 RESULTS OF THE STUDY \nIn this study, which creates database of information and \ndata for above mentioned purposes, insulation systems of \ngroup of devices were analysed post-mortem in the course of \nseveral years. Constitution of this group is shown in Table 1. \n3.1 COMPARISON BETWEEN DP AND R OF ALL UP \nTO NOW ANALYSED TRANSFORMERS \nEnclosed graphs and tables (see Table 1, Table 2, Figure 3 \nand Figure 4) provide an opportunity to compare trends of DP \nand R in all obtained results from the set of analysis of \ninsulation system which were performed on transformers \nmeant for disposal or on overhauled transformers. There are \nobviously evident two biggest groups of transformers, which \ndiffer in producer and constructional design (see Table 1, \nFigure 3, among others the type of cooling), in the \nsummarizing graphs of so far available DP results from \ntransformers meant to disposal or from overhauled \ntransformers. We can generally observe from the course of DP \nalongside the winding that the higher rate of aging prevails in \nupper insulation papers of conductor (in the contact with oil, \ncoded name “b”). Differences between inner wraps (in contact \nwith metal, coded name “a”) and outer paper wraps (in contact \nwith oil, coded name “b”) in devices in transmission system \nare less obvious and in the upper half of a winding are DP \nvalues almost the same for inner conductors as for outer \nconductors. This difference is more obvious alongside whole \nwinding on power transformer.  \nTransformer T4AB defies this summarizing evaluation on \nfirst sight; it ranks among up till now vacant middle zone of \nDP values with its average ag ing value. But the variance of \nvalues especially in winding 400 kV is so big that the values \nof inner wraps (in contact with conductor, coded name “a”) \nrange in upper zone of little aged  transformers and values of \nouter wraps (in contact with oil, coded name “b”) range in \nzone of devices with DP values that signal closeness of high-\nrisk running (see Figure 3). The state of inner wraps (coded \nTable 1.

In the case of autotransformers it is even \nless (50 - 100). When it is about values of R (interval of \nvalues from 0 to 100 is taken into consideration) then \ntransformers are divided into two groups. Group of \ntransformers with higher DP value (one producer) has \ndifference between minimal values in set of samples taken \naccording to scheme in Figure 2 and maximal R in this set is \nusually 20 to 40 and interval of R values correspond rather \nwith ascertained rate of DP values. Group of transformers \nwith different construction with more aged insulation has \nbigger difference between minimal and maximal R value in \nset of taken samples (30 to 50).

The course according to Figure 5 is in the set \nof analysed devices practically an exception.  \nThe values of degradation products of paper insulation CO \na CO2 and values of oxygen for all analysed devices are shown \nfor comparison in the Table 3 and Figure 6. Selected levels of \ngases are values ascertained during some of the last DGA \nbefore liquidation or overhauling of a device.

Devices were chosen \nso that they represent ch aracteristic “behaviour” of \ntransformers from one producer assessed from the point of \nview of DP values of analysed winding. Narrowing of the set \nof transformers in comparison with Figure 3 highlighted the \ntrend of values which can get lost when using values of all \ndevices due to local divergences. \nThe device T5AL has paper insulation with high DP values \nwhich is typical for transforme rs from producer “U”. In the \ncase of this device more distinct inequality in aging of \nsamples than it is usual in transformers of this producer \nshowed up. Lowered DP values occur especially in 220kV \nwinding in upper part of winding on the outer turn of the disk \n(D2a and D2b) and in the middle part of winding on the inner \nand outer turn (D3a, D3b, D4a). \nIt generally holds true for transformers “U” that samples of \npaper insulation from the whole set have relatively high DP \nvalues (see foregoing text) and that the regularly repeated \nplace with moderately worse state of insulation is on the \nTable 4.

If other inequalities \nof aging show themselves in insulation then it is worse state of \npaper wraps in the contact with oil (samples coded “b”) which \noccurs more frequently in the lower part of winding. In the \ncase of transformer T5AL this scheme is partially valid for \nresults of DP in 110kV winding where the worse state of outer \nwraps in contact with oil applies alongside whole winding. \nWinding 220 kV is from the point of view of DP values \nis altogether in worse state than the 110 kV winding, \nusually it is the other way around. Higher rate of aging \noccurs also in the inner and outer turn of middle disk (D3a, \nD3b, D4a) and in the upper half of winding (turn number 2, \n3 and 4) there are more aged paper wraps on conductor \n(samples coded “a”). Transformer had according to DGA \nresults and a record of operating history problems with \nhermetization and cooling and the suspicion of fault D2 \naccording to IEC 60599 (discharge of high energy) was \ndiagnosed by laboratory in 2002 and 2010. In the graphs in \nthe Figure 9 it is apparent that the values of concentrations \nof gases and the rate of increase were more likely low \n(apart from acetylene) but the ratios of concentrations can \nindicate this fault. \nIn Figure 9 the distinctive difference in the rate of \nincrease of dissociation gases in both transformers is \nevident. Displayed time interval represent approximately \ntwo years of running in both cases. The increase of gases in \ntransformer T2AN is rather steep and the rate of increase of \ngases is higher than the interval of values of usual rates of \nincrease observed in the majority of running devices as it is \nstated in standard IEC 60599. This concerns especially \nmethane and ethylene on the contrary the concentration of \nacetylene is very low (see seconda ry vertical axis in graph \nFigure 9). In transformer T5 AL the increase rate of \nmajority of dissociation gases is low in comparison with \nusual values but the exception is the increase of acetylene \nunlike the T2AN. Nevertheless it is evident from the part of \nthis Table 4 that these values are not critical.  \nDevice T5AL was simultaneously characterized by \nrelatively high content of gases and also by high value of \nCO which despite repeated degassing of oil exceeded upper \nlimit for typical concentration of this type of degradation \nproduct which is given by IEC 60599 as 600 ppm. From \ngraphs that compare concentration values of gases CO and \nCO\n2 ascertained from DGA during the running the unique \nposition of the device T5AL among transformers of group \n“U” is evident. The device has unusual high CO values \nalthough the content of CO\n2 ranges in span typical for other \ndevices (Figure 10 and Figure 11). \n \n \nFigure 9.

Models are \nmostly based on results of in laboratory implemented \naccelerated aging and they ca nnot take into account many \nparameters (temperature of oil, content of water in paper, the \noxygen content, the acidity of oil, the construction of \ntransformer, type of used paper, the decrease in not-\nhermetized devices) that affect the content of furans dissolved \nin oil, see for example the study [12] \nValues showed in Table 5 and used in correlation curve \nFigure 12 are calculated from relationship that is mentioned in \nstudy [13], proceeding from ope rating data and laboratory \nmeasurements.

Especially the influence of temperature participates in \nmigration, when the share of 2FAL in oil increases with \ngrowing temperature at the expense of paper insulation. \nBigger content of furanic substances stays however always in \npaper insulation. In the range of temperatures from 55 to \n100°C the content of 2FAL dissolv ed in oil after reaching the \nstate of equilibrium  is approximately 15% of total content of \nproduced 2FAL [14].  \nTable 5.

Müllerová et al.: Life Cycle Management of Powe r Transformers: Results and Discussion of Case Studies  \n4.1 CORRELATION OF 2FAL CONTENT IN OIL AND \nDP OF ANALYSED DEVICES \nTable 5 summarizes known values of furans in liquidated \ntransformers in which the analysis of DP of taken samples of paper \nwas performed at the same time as the determination of 2FAL \nconcentration (either these two values were both determined \nsimultaneously during the liquidation of a device or in some phase \nof running, when the DP was determined from the sample taken \nduring necessary revision intervention into inner space of a device). \nIn this case we have both DP value and 2FAL concentration at \ndisposal, both values determined by laboratory. Based on these \ndata it is possible at least in the small set of data to verify the \ncorrelation relationships by calculation of DP and by comparison \nwith the chemically determined value. If the date of DP \ndetermination and 2FAL concentration determination is not the \nsame and if there is acceptable time difference then the nearest \nfigure of 2FAL concentration in time is chosen for calculation of \nDP. \nDP values gained by laboratory analysis of samples of paper \ninsulation wraps and used in the Figure 12 are either average value \nfrom 12 samples alongside the winding (see method of sampling in \nchapter 2.2 during liquidation of device) or one value gained by \nsampling during reparation of transformer. The series DP\nmin are the \nlowest values of DP from the set of 12 samples (they are available \nonly for samples taken during liquidation where all 12 samples are \npresent). The levels of 2FAL content (ppm), which are the same or \nare at least very close in date of oil sampling as the taking of paper \nsamples and these two samplings are not separated by intervention \ninto oil filling, are matched with them. For DP values calculated \nfrom 2FAL in Table 5 the Chendong’s model was used [13], see \nequitation (4).  \nIn the correlation curve it is evident that the Chendong’s \nmodel has much worse correlation for minimal real DP value \ndetermined by analysis of samples from winding then it does for \nthe average value of all 12 sample s. Further it is necessary to \nrelease that the content of fura ns in oil is the effect of \ndegradation of all cellulosed components present. Even if we \nignore furans produced by constructional trafoboard or wooden \nelements, there are still other windings in the container. Their \ncontribution to furans production will depend on the weight of \npaper insulation of individual windings and that is the \ninformation which we do not usually have at disposal for older \nrunning devices. If we despite a bove mentioned reservations \nadjusted the correlation of 2FAL and DP values determined by \nlaboratory analysis, it would correspond to the relationship: \n \n00217 , 0\n5223 , 0 2 log\n\n FALDP  (5) \n5 CONCLUSION \nFrom up to now acquired results it is evident, that the \ninformation database generation by the postmortem analyses of the \ninsulating system of transformers meant for disposal or \nof overhauled transformers has immediate utilization in operating \npractice.  \nAt the same time, just as the next analyses continue, the \nobservations appear in evaluation process of particular cases that \nare possible to generalize and to use for definition of the next trends \nin this research sphere. \nRelational coefficient determined based on the results of post-\nmortem analysis (see 2.1) is generally valuable for particular group \nof transformers. The typical attributes of aging are identical for the \nmost of the transformers in the group, see for example the \ndevelopment of DP values alongside the winding. The group of \ntransformers with similar level and character of aging is defined \nrather by manufacturer and construction than by the way of \nrunning which has far less influence. The correlation of DP and \ntensile strength corresponds with typical transformers groups but \nthere are some distinct differences in the level of paper aging \naccording to DP and tensile strength for some of the transformers \nin the group. The results of DGA and non-standard events during \nthe running of the transformer are information essential for aging \nlevel evaluation. The results of some case studies show that the \nrunning problems (ineffective cooling, leaking, higher gases \ndevelopment) manifest themselves in the level of relational \ncoefficient. Generalization of results of correlation between DP and \n2FAL performed in this study is limited by the small number of \ninput data and by non-systematic observation of furan values. We \ncontinue to expand the database.  \nConsidering the fact that the detail data record of running history \nis always the part of every study of individual transformers \n(service, nonstandard intervention, failures, DGA, rate of gases \ndevelopment, state of oil filling, device temperature, etc.) then the \ndatabase and the conclusion resulting from it are continuously \nupdated. \nREFERENCES \n[1] W.
