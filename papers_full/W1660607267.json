    "abstract": "We present a practical method for achieving a transformer ratio (R) greater than 2 with any collinear wakefield accelerator—i.e. with either plasma or structure based wakefield accelerators. It is known that the transformer ratio cannot generally be greater than 2 for a symmetric drive bunch in a collinear wakefield accelerator. However, using a ramped bunch train (RBT) where a train of n electron drive bunches, with increasing (“ramping”) charge, one can achieve R=2n after the bunch train. We believe this method is feasible from an engineering standpoint using existing technology and an experiment to be preformed at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) is planned.",
