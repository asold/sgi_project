Approximately 50% of the hog \nproduction is concentrated in three states, namely, Iowa, North \nCarolina, and Minnesota (\n4\n). The concentration of such a large \npopulation in a relatively small area resulted in high density, \nand consequently, relatively high vulnerability of the industry to \nthe introduction and spread of infectious diseases. The industry \nhas tried to mitigate this vulnerability by increasing biosecurity \nand other prevention strategies, including air filtration and \nquarantine of incoming pigs (\n5\n, \n6\n).\nPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is, \narguably, one of the most economically devastating diseases \naffecting the U.S. swine industry, causing annual losses estimated \nto be between $550 and $664 million (\n7\n, \n8\n). The disease, caused \nby the infection of an Arterivirus , referred to as PRRS virus \n(PRRSv), emerged in the U.S. in the late 1980s and, since then, \nhas remained prevalent in the country (\n9\n, \n10\n). PRRSv is an RNA \nvirus, which has led to the appearance of a wide array of emerg-\ning or reemerging strains with a large variety of phenotypic and \ngenotypic features (\n11\n). Commercial vaccines do not prevent \ninfection although they are reported to reduce virus shedding \nand decrease clinical impact. Protection is reported to be more \nprofound after infection with homologous than heterologous \nstrains (\n12\n, \n13\n). Modified live vaccines are more effective than \nthose formulated with inactivated virus (\n14\n). Many alternative \nmechanisms of transmission have been described for PRRSv, \nincluding direct transmission through the movement of pigs \nand indirect through fomites, insects, semen, or airborne spread \n(\n6\n, \n15\n–\n20\n). The American Association of Swine Veterinarians \n(AASV) developed a classification system with four categories \nbased on infection status in sow herds. A herd was defined as \n“unstable” if field virus could be detected within the herd. These \ncategories are referred to as positive unstable (Category I), \npositive stable (Category II), provisional negative (Category III), \nand negative (Category IV) (\n21\n). In the absence of a regulatory \nframework, data on farm-level infection incidence can only be \ncollected on a voluntary basis in the U.S.\nThe University of Minnesota started a voluntary project in \n2011 referred to as the Dr. Morrison’s Swine Health Monitoring \nProgram (MSHMP) with two main objectives, namely, (1) to, in \nthe short term, translate shared data into knowledge that informs \nveterinarian and producer decisions and (2) to, in the long term, \nbuild capacity to respond, in an effective and timely manner, \nto emerging and reemerging pathogens that may threaten the \nswine industry. Initially, participants shared weekly PRRS status \ndata for sow farms, following and adapting AASV guidelines \n(\n21\n). As the program progressed, the MSHMP expanded, and \nsome participants are also sharing data for porcine epidemic \ndiarrhea (PED) and porcine delta corona virus. The MSHMP is \nquite unique because, despite its voluntary nature, it currently \nreceives weekly data from sow farms corresponding to approxi-\nmately 45% (n = 2,854,000) of the sows in the country according \nto the U.S. Census (\n 3 ), and for that reason, it is, arguably, one \nof the largest datasets of voluntarily shared information by \nproducers on swine health in the world. The MSHMP , there-\nfore, demonstrates how epidemiological knowledge on one of \nthe most pressing diseases for a large industry may be gained \nthrough the analysis of routinely collected data, as part of a \nprivate–academic partnership and in the absence of a regulatory \nframework.\nThe objective of the paper here was to summarize the methods \nand results of a variety of analytic tools applied to MSHMP data \nto elucidate the epidemiological dynamics of PRRS in the U.S. \nThis review provides a summary of knowledge gained over the \nlast years on PRRS dynamics through the use of different types of \nanalytical methods for the analysis of routinely collected surveil-\nlance data. In addition, the review will ultimately contribute to \ndemonstrate the application of epidemiological analytic tools in \nsupporting the prevention and control of, arguably, one of the \nmost economically challenging diseases for the swine industry \nworldwide.\nMAT e R i ALS AND M e THODS\nA systematic pathway was used to direct the application of epide-\nmiological tools to assess the epidemiological dynamics of PRRS \nand its related components, as described elsewhere (\n22\n).\nSpace and Time Clustering\nTwo different approaches and tools were used to quantify the \nspatial dependence of PRRS incidence since 2011. Specifically,\n \na.\n \nSpatial scan statistical models were used to determine the \nrepeatability of annual patterns of disease incidence in \nspace and to compare the spatial distribution of the disease \nbefore and after the country was affected by PED (\n23\n, \n24\n). \nAn exponentially weighted moving average and an upper \nconfidence limit were used to signal the onset of the epidemic  \nseason.\n \nb.\n \nSpace and time point process assessed by G- and K-functions \nwere used to quantify the clustering of PRRS outbreaks, as \nwell as data sharing to evaluate its relationship with PRRS \nincidence on a subset of participants (\n25\n).\nFactors That i nfluence PRRS Risk\n a.  The significance of quarterly and annual PRRS incidence \nfrom 2009 to 2013 was assessed using a chi-square test. \nFurthermore, logistic regression was used to estimate the \nlikelihood of the presence of PRRSv infection in a given year \nincreasing the odds of that herd being infected the following \nyear (\n23\n). Chi-square test and logistic regression models were \nalso used to compare PRRS incidence between 2009–2012 and \n2013, the year that PED was first detected in the U.S., and used \nto explain how its emergence might have affected the temporal \ndynamics, and overall incidence of PRRS (\n24\n).\n3\nVilalta et al.\nQuantitative Tools Applied in MSHMP\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 4 | Article 94\n b. A general linear mixed-effects logistic regression model was \nused to investigate the association between factors hypoth-\nesized to influence PRRS risk (i.e., month, farm type, county \ndensity, active participation in a voluntary control program, \nand proportion of farms stable) and PRRS incidence (25).\n c. A mixed-effect Poisson regression model was built to evaluate \nthe effects of land coverage (e.g., cultivated fields and shrubs \nor trees) and geographical features (including terrain slope \nand altitude) on the incidence of PRRS outbreaks considering \nthe years of 2009–2016. The model included a random effect \nat the production system level and also included explanatory \nvariables that were known to affect the risk of PRRS outbreaks \nsuch as pig density, farm size, and geographical region (26).\n d. Species distribution models, such as presence-only maximum \nentropy machine learning algorithm, were used to build risk \nmaps through predicting the spatial distribution of PRRSv out-\nbreaks using a set of environmental variables.\n1 That algorithm \ncan extract associations to characterize the demographic and \nclimatic requirements for PRRSv, and subsequently deploying \nthose associations to predict suitable geographical locations in \nnon-sampled areas, where most likely PRRSv outbreaks will \nbe detected (see text footnote 1).\nevolutionary Analysis\nA large dataset (n = 6,774) of open reading frame 5 (ORF5) com-\nplete sequences provided by five production systems was used to \nstudy the evolution and spread of PRRSv across included systems. \nBayesian phylogenetic analysis with divergence time, growth rate, \npopulation size, and estimation of viral dispersal history between \nsystems was applied to this dataset to understand the order of \nevents and spatiotemporal progression of this specific cluster (27).\nModeling\nTime-dependent reproduction (TD-R) numbers for PRRS across \ndifferent regions and production systems within the U.S. were \nestimated. The uses of TD-R include monitoring of epidemic \ntrends over time, identification of “super-spreader events, ” \nmeasurement of progress of interventions over time, and extrac-\ntion of parameters for mathematical models (e.g., models to test \ninterventions) (28).\nPrototype of a Real-time Data \nvisualization Dashboard\nFinally, an application was developed in RStudio Shiny (29) to \nallow for real-time visualization of MSHMP data including \nanalytical outputs of different types of analysis [Pig/Statistical \nAnalysis and Visual Insights (SAVI)]. Pig/SAVI allows for data \nvisualization and analysis using web-based and standalone \nversions. JavaScript and CSS were used to enable some of the \nfunctionality and visual elements. Several functional elements \nwere utilized, including reactivity, isolation, and download of \noutputs into CSV format.\n1 Alkhamis M, Arruda AG, Vilalta C, Morrison R, Perez A. Surveillance of porcine \nreproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in the United States using risk map-\nping and species distribution modeling. Prev Vet Med.\nReSULTS\nSpace and Time Clustering\nPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome showed a \nrepetitive pattern within a cohort of sow farms in time and \nspace. It was determined that the onset of the PRRS season began \nevery year during the fall (between the months of October and \nNovember). Furthermore, spatial clusters of PRRS positive farms \nwere consistently identified in similar locations throughout the \nstudy period (23, 24). Spatial trends in PRRS case distribution \nafter PED emergence were similar to those found in previous \nstudies at the national level (23, 24), although PRRS incidence \ndecreased during that year. These data suggest that changes in \nmanagement and biosecurity to avoid spread of PED may have \naffected PRRS incidence nationally without affecting the spatial \ndependence of PRRS incidence.\nFactors That influence PRRS Risk\nFarms that were PRRS infected in a given year were more likely \nto be infected in consecutive years compared to those that were \nnot affected by PRRS. However, during the year in which PED \nemerged in the U.S., that pattern changed and the described \nassociation could no longer be observed. Furthermore, PRRS \nincidence was significantly lower, and the beginning of the PRRS \nseason was delayed, compared to previous years (23, 24).\nAnalysis of data collected on a regional project in Minnesota, \nreferred to as RCP-N212, suggested an increased interest of \nproducers in participating in regional control programs during \nthe study period, from July 2012 to June 2014. That analysis also \nshowed, however, that participation on a regional project is not \nnecessarily highly correlated with probability of data sharing. \nTime within the analyzed period (24 months) and the probability \nof sharing PRRS status to the voluntary regional control program \nwere negatively associated with disease outbreaks, while density \n(as number of farms per square mile) was positively associated \nwith PRRS outbreaks. Findings in this study showed that despite a \nstatistical decreasing trend of the disease, spatiotemporal cluster-\ning of PRRS was observed along the whole study period. In turn, \nfarm type (i.e., farms with and without breeding herds) did not \nshow a specific association with PRRS, although farms with sows \nwere more prone to report PRRS status in the RCP-N212 (25).\nLand-related variables and land coverage appeared to have an \nimpact on the incidence of PRRS outbreaks. Sow farms located \nin areas of cultivated/managed areas had higher incidence of \nPRRS outbreaks when compared to sow farms located in areas \ncharacterized by having herbaceous areas or trees. Altitude, as \nexpressed in meters above sea level, did not appear to be associ-\nated with the occurrence of PRRS outbreaks; however, farms in \nslopes larger than 9%, when compared with the neighbor, had \nlower incidence of PRRS outbreaks compared to those located in \nareas characterized by slopes less than 2% (26).\nResults of the maximum entropy model suggested that hog \ndensity was the most important predictor for PRRS incidence, \nwhereas a number of environmental factors accounted for much \nof the remaining risk. More specifically, when considering differ-\nent regions, swine density still has a role in impacting the number \nof cases being a driven factor in swine denser areas. However, \nFigURe 1 | Dashboard of the RStudio Shiny-based application [Pig/Statistical Analysis and Visual Insights (SAVI)] with its four core analytical components: \nfrequency, genetics, space time analysis, and movement.\n4\nVilalta et al.\nQuantitative Tools Applied in MSHMP\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 4 | Article 94\nsome other variables such as precipitation or temperature can \nhave an impact on the spread of the disease (see text footnote 1).\nevolutionary Analysis\nSpatial distribution of farms and production systems has an \nimportant role in the maintenance of endemic PRRSv strains \nand the occurrence of epidemic PRRS episodes. Recent  \nemergence of novel PRRSv occurred in certain production \nsystems, escalating to epidemic proportions when other, highly \nconnected systems were reached. Sow farms seem to have a \npotential role in maintaining and spreading the disease within \nthose production systems (27).\nModeling\nAlthough most PRRS outbreaks were reported in areas with the \nhighest hog density, between farm PRRS transmission patterns \ndiffered substantially among regions. Differences in transmissi-\nbility were reported between different regions and systems, with \nevident peaks of disease occurring in different regions at different \ntimes. Results suggested that factors other than season and swine \ndensity might have a major impact on PRRS spread at the regional \nlevel, but such factors need to be elucidated (28).\nPrototype of a Real-time Data \nvisualization Dashboard\nThe RStudio Shiny application platform integrates portions of \nthe data described above into a system that allows near real-time \ndata sharing, visualization, and analysis to support disease pre-\nvention and control. Its aim is also to improve the accessibility \nof the data and to add value to the program for different system \nstakeholders. The current array of tools developed as part of the \nepidemiological platform includes descriptive visualizations of \nprevalence and incidence over time, real-time risk maps, network \nvisualizations, and molecular epidemiology tools, including the \nability of the user to build different types of phylogenetic trees \n(Figure 1).\nDiSCUSSiON\nThe MSHMP efforts resulted in a unique dataset generated \nthrough a voluntary system, which demonstrates U.S. producers’ \ncommitment to sharing data toward the common goal of mitigat-\ning PRRS impact in the country. However, collection of data by \nitself has no value unless it is analyzed to bring knowledge and \nwisdom to improve speed and quality of decisions (30). Here, \nthe value of sharing, aggregating data, and creating knowledge \nhas been demonstrated with the use of multidisciplinary analytic \ntools that helped to maintain producer’s interest in a voluntary \ndata sharing project. In the absence of a regulatory framework, \ndata sharing is a prerequisite for increasing disease awareness \nand, ultimately, supporting its control. Lessons learnt from \nthe systematic analysis of the MSHMP relate to the repetitive \ntime and time–space patterns associated with PRRS incidence \nin the U.S. and the regional variation, and the influence that \n5\nVilalta et al.\nQuantitative Tools Applied in MSHMP\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 4 | Article 94\nchanges on epidemiological conditions, may have in those pat-\nterns. In addition, quantitative evidence was collected on how  \nphylogenetic analysis may support investigations on the most \nlikely mechanisms of spread of the virus, and how collaboration \nand data sharing may contribute to the control of the disease at \nthe regional level in the absence of a regulatory framework.\nA negative association between sharing PRRS status and \nincidence was found. It is unknown if this relationship is because \nnegative farms are more inclined to share the data or if the increase \nin awareness has an effect on the incidence of the disease. However, \nin that specific study, the participation of farms, as well as PRRS \nstatus sharing, increased in the time frame studied suggesting \nthat farmers and veterinarians may perceive collaboration as an \nadvantage (25).\nNoteworthy, even though a substantial amount of effort has \nbeen devoted to describing PRRSv transmission routes (15– 18), \nmany aspects of the disease epidemiology are yet-to-be-eluci-\ndated. For example, the proportional importance of transmis-\nsion routes (air, pig movement, or fomites) in the spread of the \ndisease and whether that pattern is mostly influenced by system \nor region remain unknown. The application of different analyti-\ncal tools to the rich dataset assessed here has helped producers \nand practitioners to better understand the epidemiological \ndynamics of PRRS. For example, we learned that the onset of \nthe disease had a repetitive pattern and a similar starting point \nfrom the first 4 years of data of the project, from 2009 to 2012 \n(23). However, data from 2013 and 2014, when PED emerged \nin the country, failed to signal the epidemics at the same date \nas predicted by previous years, showing a delay of 3  weeks \n(24). Also during that same season (2013 and 2014), the same \ncohort of farms showed a 50% decrease in the number of PRRS \noutbreaks between October and March when compared with \nthe average observed in the same season in the previous four \nprevious years. Many factors may have impacted the change in \ndisease pattern observed that year, including an increase of bios-\necurity practices associated with PED emergence, an increase \nof PRRS vaccination, secular cycles, or difficulty performing \nthe routine PRRSv diagnostics following high PED mortality \nrates. Furthermore, no changes in the centroid of the epidemic \nclusters were observed between 2009 and 2014, suggesting that \nalthough incidence decreased that year, the spatial dependence \nof the disease prevailed. Preliminary results of disaggregating \nnational data and aggregating cases from different states (not \npublished) seem to point to a different temporal incidence \ntrend between geographical regions and/or systems, and those \ncould be caused by different factors as management, density or \ndifferent climate conditions as pointed by the ecological niche \nmodeling (see text footnote 1).\nHigher disease incidence was observed and linked to new \nPRRSv introduction that quickly disseminated in an area or \nsystem (27). Those observations were also supported by the \ndescription of PRRS transmissibility across regions and systems \nusing the TD-R (28). Interestingly, the two densest swine regions \nshowed different patterns of disease transmission, which may be \nsomehow explained by a difference in management and PRRS \nimmunization. The TD-R showed to be a valuable method to \nsignal PRRS epidemics on those areas where outbreaks are rela-\ntively rare. For areas in which PRRSv is endemic, TD-R did not \nshow any fluctuation and revolved around 1, which is expected \nfor an endemic disease such as PRRS.\nThe finding that having crops or trees around the farm could \ninfluence the occurrence of new cases was intriguing and may \nhave multiple interpretations and applications (26). It would \nbe, indeed, interesting to assess whether the use of natural tree \nbuffers could make a significant impact on the protection of the \nherd. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information on \nhow vegetative buffers could prevent the spread of the diseases or \nprotect the herd from PRRS infection. Similar conclusions were \nextracted using an ecological niche modeling approach in which \nland cover accounted for much of the variation in PRRS risk, \nafter hog density and precipitation (see text footnote 1). However, \nfurther analysis is needed to confirm these findings.\nBecause sharing information was perceived by at least some \ncompanies as a competitive advantage as they can learn new \ninsights on the disease epidemiology, some MSHMP participants \nstarted sharing PRRSv ORF5 sequences. ORF 5 sequencing has \nrecently become a relatively common practice within the swine \nindustry. The amount of available data from Veterinary Diagnostic \nLaboratories, and the use of new molecular epidemiology tools \nmay help elucidate the relative importance of different transmis-\nsion routes during outbreak investigations. For example, using \nORF5 sequences from five different companies and Bayesian \nphylodynamic methods that could integrate time, space, and \nphylogenetic analysis allowed for a better estimate on the history \nof the virus, helping us to understand the underlying connections \nin the disease spread process (27).\nAs part of the same project, a platform that could provide access \nto data and analytical outputs in real time was also explored and \ndeveloped. Such a platform could provide a decision advantage \nduring the control of the disease and hence, potentially provide \nand demonstrate value of the MSHMP to the industry. Thus, \nan application was built using the R software and the R Study \nShiny platform to link MSMHP outputs with different stake-\nholder groups. At this stage, the epidemiological tools included: \ndescriptive epidemiology (incidence and prevalence over time), \nphylogenetic analysis, risk maps, and network analysis. Further \nextensions are possible. Having all the updated information in \na real-time fashion can help people involved in health manage-\nment to make better-informed decisions. It might also be used to \nreplace labor-intensive scheduled reporting resulting in greater \nsystem efficiency and improve stakeholder engagement as previ-\nously demonstrated (31).\nCONCLUSiON\nThe review here summarizes the knowledge gained over the last \n6 years on the epidemiological dynamics of the most devastating \ndisease affecting the U.S. swine industry through the voluntary \nMSHMP . When evaluating PRRS incidence data at a national \nscale, there is a predictable incidence pattern, with winter offer -\ning environmental conditions most favorable for virus spread at \nlong (transport and fomites) and short (airborne) distances, and \n6\nVilalta et al.\nQuantitative Tools Applied in MSHMP\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 4 | Article 94\nhog density and system being the most relevant factors associated \nwith the spatial distribution of disease. However, when incidence \ndata are explored at low levels of aggregation (state or county), \nfactors such as presence of trees, being located in a hilly area, \nor fine-scale weather conditions are most influential on the risk \nfor PRRS spread. Finally, this review demonstrates the level of \ncontribution that the use of novel multidisciplinary analysis \ntools applied to routine collection of large surveillance data may \nprovide to prevention and control of livestock diseases in the U.S. \nand at a global scale.\nAUTHOR CONTRiBUTiONS\nCV—primary author.
