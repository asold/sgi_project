Multimedia has \novercome the barriers of time and space and provides evidence \nto be accepted as an anytime and anywhere tool for educating \nmulti-disciplinary masses. The process of knowledge acquisition \nbecomes more efficient when the learners experience an event \nthrough a multimedia simulation. Multimedia technology \nempowers the education al process by means of increased \ninteraction between teachers and the students. Apart from the \nfact that multimedia can provide educators and students with \nendless possibilities of quality teaching and learning, taking \nvital considerations of the pedagogical strengths and limitations \nof Multimedia, it can be used to its fullest potency, and reach the \neminence of ‘New Educational Technology tool’. \n \nIndex Terms —Multimedia, educational technology, \nmulti-disciplinary, pedagogy, constructivist learning \nenvironment.  \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThis paper presents a comprehensive study of selected \npapers that are pertinent to the use of Multimedia in \nEducation, as well as lists down the various proposed \nmulti-disciplinary educational frameworks and tools for the \nsame. In this paper, a study of most commonly used methods \nand issues related to the use of Multimedia as a new \neducation technology tool has been carried out and reported. \nIt also presents a categorized listing of such papers, \naccompanied by annotations that describe the content of the \npapers and their relevance to the use of Multimedia in \nEducation. \n \nII. MULTIMEDIA AND EDUCATION \nA. What Is Multimedia? \nMultimedia is a melody sung in harmony with \nmulti-channel and multi -modal bits of knowledge and \ncreation. Sometimes it is as small as a rotating globe used as \nlogo in an amateur‟s website or is as huge as Xbox 360 games \nor DreamWorks‟ Shrek series. Its ultimate role is to inform, \neducate and/or entertain all. Multimedia is all -pervading, \nthrilling and involving method of info -edu-tainment with \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \nmultiple facets and long lasting approbation.  \nB. Educational Technology \nEducational technology is the study and ethical practice of \nfacilitating learning and improving performance by creating, \nusing and managing appropriate technological processes and \nresources [1]. It is most simply and contentedly defined as an \nassortment of tools that might prove helpful in student \ncentered learning, problem based learning or case -based \nlearning. It advocates the teacher becoming “Guide on the \nSide” rather than “Sage on the Stage” [ 2]. Educational \nTechnology also called „Learning Technology‟, mainly \ncomprise of the use of technology in the process of teaching \nand learning. Here the term „Technology‟ does not only \ninclude the use of latest tools and techniques like laptops, \ninteractive whiteboards, and smart phones; internet, Wi -Fi, \nand YouTube etc., although they are massively preferred by \ntoday‟s learners for their learning potential, but also \nencompasses efficient and enhanced learning management \nsystems, schema of information dissemination, effective \nteaching and management of student masses, feedback \nmechanisms and performance evaluation methodologies etc. \nC. Multimedia Learning Environment \nMultimedia provides a technology based constructivist \nlearning environment [ 3] where students are able to solve a \nproblem by means of self explorations, collaboration and \nactive participation. Simulations, models and media rich \nstudy materials like still and animated graphics, video and \naudio integrated in a structured manner facilitate the learning \nof new knowledge much more effectively. The interactive \nnature of multimedia provides the room to enhance \ntraditional \"chalk-and-talk\" method of teaching [4] with more \nflexibility to learners to adapt to individual learning strategy. \nIt enables both the educators and learners to work together in \nan informal setting. The role of edu cators and learners are \nextended. Furthermore, it encourages and enhances peer \nlearning as well as individual creativity and innovation. \n \nIII. MULTIMEDIA AND ITS PEDAGOGICAL STRENGTHS \nMultimedia facilitates mastering basic skills of a student \nby means of drill and practice. It helps in problem solving by \nmeans of learning by doing, understanding abstract concepts, \nprovide enhanced access for teachers and students in remote \nlocations, facilitate individualized and cooperative learning, \nhelps in management and administration of classroom \nactivities and learning content, and simulate real life problem \nhandling environments. Multimedia Technology is used and \nexperimented by various educational institutions of all levels \nall over the world in their own designed modes. \nUse of Multimedia as a New Educational Technology \nTool–A Study \nS.

MULTIMEDIA IN EDUCATION: UNIVERSITIES APPROACH \nThere are two ways,  multimedia education is imparted to \nthe students by various universities / institutions:    \na)Teaching methodologies of multimedia content creation, \nwhich include imparting hands -on skills of software \npackages used for creation and authoring of multimedia \ncontent, and b) Employing interactive multimedia content \nand tech nology for effective teaching, which include the \nvarious methods of engaged learning like multimodal \ninteractive information delivery; and personalized and \nenhanced anytime-anywhere access of the content. Table I \npresents a few initiatives taken by various educational bodies \nto understand, implement and evaluate the type of \nmultimedia required in the time to come so that it justifies its \nuniversal acceptance as a major tool of Educational \nTechnology. \n \nTABLE I: EVALUATION OF ROLE OF MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION \nIssue      Proposed Model/Solution/System                              Annotations \nDevelopment and implementation of \nAustralia‟s first undergraduate \nmultimedia degree course at Griffith \nUniversity \nThe article [ 5] discusses the three levels of \neducational requirements in Multimedia Education: \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis article [ 5] has presented an outlook of multimedia \npractice and research used to design and develop an \nundergraduate degree curriculum in multimedia to suffice \nfuture educational and industrial needs. It emphasizes the \nkind of multimedia education which is capable to enable \nstudents to create simulated, interactive, information \nspaces requiring the in -depth knowledge of multimedia \ncomputing and communication systems, understanding \nof computer hardware, software, and multimodal data \nprocessing technologies to provide quality solutions to \nnovel problems, and not just learn content authoring \nusing certain software packages.  \nAssist educators to choose between \nnumerous educational Multimedia \ntechnologies. \nKnowing that the technological availability of \nmultimedia resources is possible, the pedagogical \nevaluation of multimedia is proposed to be done [6]. \nThis paper [ 6] advocates the need of evaluation of the \neffectiveness of new multimedia technologies in class \nroom environment in the light of their contribution in the \nimproved teaching and learning. \nThe future educational paradigm, the \nrole and extend of the use of \nMultimedia in it. \nFLiE (Flexible Local independent education [7]. This paper [ 7] proposes that the new futuristic \neducational Model FLiE, would allow flexible education \nand is supported by interactive communication tools \nauthored by both teachers and students, and indulge them \nin life-long education. \nTo enable students to ask questions \nelectronically and anonymously in \nclass. \nActiveClass (A networked classroom technology) \nimplemented on Undergraduate class in Computer \nScience at UC San Diego known as Active campus \n[8]. \nThis paper [8] send regrets to the adoption of ActiveClass \nseeing unsatisfactory participation of students with varied \nreasons such as, unavailability of sufficient laptops, \nheterogeneous mass with diverse interests, engaging \nstudents into more irrelevant tasks while lectures and \nhence could not effectively augment the current \nclassroom behavior as desired. \nTo provide inter -disciplinary \nknowledge and skills dealing with \nvisual aesthetic understanding and \ncommunication, integrated with  \ntechnological knowledge, in order to \nbecome effective and efficient \nemployees in the information age. \nInterdisciplinary Bachelor of Science degree in \nInteractive Digital Media at Northwest Missouri \nState University [9]. \n \nThis paper [ 9] presents an interdi sciplinary approach \nof Education which in -turn is developed and maintained \nby three departments, Art, Computer \nScience/Information Systems and Mass Communication \nto provide students various courses on Interactive digital \nmedia, Computer science programming , new media and \nvisual imaging. The course has been designed with the \nindustry input considering the upcoming demands and \ncurriculum is modified time to time to justify its purpose. \n \nV. MULTIMEDIA EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS: \nMULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH \nVarious Multimedia educational programs have been \ndesigned, developed and implemented as a solution to \nobserved problems in multiple disciplines. Various \ncombinations of Multimedia content and methodologies are  \n \n \nbeing used as a try to solve the issues. T he various \norganisations and institutions all over the world are \ndedicatedly working towards implementation of multimedia \nand exploring its multi-disciplinary utility. Table II presents a \ncritical study of a few Multimedia Educational programs. \n \nAuthoring level : only involves \ncreating multimedia content for \na given environment. \n \n \nApplication level:  focuses on \ncreating the software components \nof the environments. \nSystem level:  focuses on \nempowering students in creating \nthe complete artificial \nenvironments and multimodal \nsystems themselves. \n \n  \n \n   \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nInternational Journal of Information and Education Technology, Vol. 2, No. 5, October 2012\n470\n  \nTABLE II: EVALUATION OF MULTI-DISCIPLINARY MULTIMEDIA EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS \nProgram Target Users Goal(s) Multimedia Technology used Annotations \nHEADS UP       \n(Health Education \nand Discovering \nScience while \nunlocking potential) \nInner-City \nNon-Asian \nMinority \nMiddle-School \nStudents in the \nUS \nTo develop their \ninterest in science \nand encourage them \nto enter academic \npipeline to careers in \nhealth sciences \n(1) Video career stories of minority health \nscientists on DVD or VHS cassette \ntapes. \n(2) Graphics and Animations during hands \non activities.  \n(3) Web based Resources. \n(4) Teacher Resources following iterative \nreview and feedback design process. \nThe program presented in paper [ 10] \nresults assures to diminish the \nachievement gap between white and \nnon-Asian minority middle school \nstudents by presenting life stories of \nminority scientists in a multimedia \nframework. \nWIT \n(Williams \nInstructional \nTechnology) \nSummer \nTechnology \nstudent interns \nworking on \nfaculty \nproposed \nprojects \nTo develop high  \nquality multimedia \nbased projects to be \nused by faculty in \nteaching \n(1) Print Publications to advertise WIT. \n(2) Presentations to share project \nexperiences. \n(3) Daily messages on web to announce \ncollection of project proposals. \n(4) Digital Story Telling workshops during \ntraining. \nThis summer technology program \n[11] has successfully proven the use \nof Multimedia technology in training \nthe interns, and facilitated the \ncreation of projects that work in \nclassroom teaching. \nACALPA (Affective \nComputer-Aided \nLearning Platform for \nChildren with \nAutism) \nImplemented in \na specialized \nschool for \npeople with \nautism. \nTo examine and \nfacilitate the \neducational \nprocedure for \npeople with autism. \n(1) Everyday use objects, colors and words \nto help sustain user‟s interest during \ngame. \n(2) Avatar dri ven instructions or \nsynthesized speech in autistic person‟s \nnative language. \n(3) Feedback through Avatar‟s visual \nexpression of emotions. \n(4) Personalized instructions and the various \ndifficulty levels for different users. \nThis Multimedia system [12] provide \nthe i nteractive modules to support \ntechniques and methods that are used \nin autistic persons‟ education such as \nTEACCH, which involves a \nstructured teaching approach and the \nuse of visual materials especially \ntargeting to the person‟s visual \nprocessing strengths \nKAD \n(Kino-Ani-Drama) \nand Animation \nTherapy \nImplemented on \nthe children and \nadolescents of \nsouth Korea \nTo reduce stress \nrelated problems \ncaused by excessive \nuse of internet, \nvideo games and \nmass-media \n(1) Off-line Kino -Ani-Drama Therapy \nincluding Dance and Drama Therapy, \nMusic Therapy & painting therapy. \n(2) Online Animation Therapy including \n2D, 3D Animation, virtual reality, \nAugmented reality, hypertext etc. \nThis multimedia therapy program \n[13] showed therapeutic results to the \nmind and body of stressed out \nNet-generation caused by negative \neffect of compulsive use of media  by \nconstructively engaging them in \nmedia production like videos, \nanimations etc. \nTiM 3-10 yrs, old, \nblind or having \nsevere visual \nimpairment \nTo design, develop \nand to adapt \ncomputer games for \nvisually impaired \nchildren \n(1) Tactile and Sound Interface for    playing \nthrough interactive stories. \n(2) Use of concept keyboard. \n(3) Use of Joysticks to control sound \ninterface. \nThe Multimedia project presented in \npaper [1 4] advocate the use of \nMultimedia computer games for \nvisually impaired children as an aid \nfor their psychomotor development \nand enhanced  adaptability to Human \ncomputer Interface. \n \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, a study has been carried out to analyze the \nreverence of multimedia in various disciplines of current \neducation system. From the review of literature in reference \nwith a variety of university approaches, it has been learnt that \nmultimedia ha s enormous potential to impart flexible, \nmulti-modal, life -long education to heterogeneous mass \nlearners. The Multi-disciplinary nature of multimedia makes \nit increasingly popular among people from diverse domains. \nThe literature study clearly demonstrates its qualifications as \na vast source of customized learning environments, to \naccommodate varied behavioral problems like confidence \nbuilding and stress reduction. Multimedia used in right \ndirection has also succeeded in psychomotor development \nand strengthening of visual processing of the intended users. \nIn conjunction with the study of usefulness of multimedia \nin different educational scenarios, the important point for \nfuture research is that the time to come will surely promise \nthe availability of multimedia technology to one and all, but \nits usage should be limited to and in consideration with its \npedagogical strengths. The above studies have clearly \nindicated that even if the networked classroom technology is \nmade available to the students, there were ma ny other \npedagogical issues because of which the students‟ interest \nand interaction in the class room could not be increased. \nMore research work is required in the area of multimedia \npedagogy so that the design, form and content of Multimedia \nis such that it does not hinder the usual educational process \nand supplements it with more info-edu-tainment. \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n    \n \n      \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n             \n \n     \n \n \n \n \nInternational Journal of Information and Education Technology, Vol. 2, No. 5, October 2012\n471\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
