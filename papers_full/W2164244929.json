The Business Process Modeling Nota tion (BPMN) is an increasingly \nimportant industry standard for the graphical representation of business proc-\nesses. BPMN offers a wide range of modeling constructs, significantly more \nthan other popular languages. However, not all of these constructs are equally \nimportant in practice as business analysts frequently use arbitrary subsets of \nBPMN. In this paper we investigate what these subsets are, and how they differ \nbetween academic, consulting, and general use of the language. We analyzed \n120 BPMN diagrams using mathematical and statistical techniques. Our find-\nings indicate that BPMN is used in groups of several, well-defined construct \nclusters, but less than 20% of its vocabulary is regularly used and some con-\nstructs did not occur in any of the models we analyzed. While the average \nmodel contains just 9 different BPMN constructs, models of this complexity \nhave typically just 4-5 constructs in common, which means that only a small \nagreed subset of BPMN has emerged. Our findings have implications for the \nentire ecosystems of analysts and modelers in that they provide guidance on \nhow to reduce language complexity, which should increase the ease and speed \nof process modeling. \nKeywords: BPMN, Language Analysis, Process Modeling. \n1   Introduction \nThe Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) [1] is emerging as a standard lan-\nguage for capturing business processes, especially at the level of domain analysis and \nhigh-level systems design. A growing number of process design, enterprise architec-\nture, and workflow automation tools provide modeling environments for BPMN. The \ndevelopment of BPMN was influenced by the demand for a graphical notation that \ncomplements the BPEL standard for executable business processes. Although this \ndevelopment gives BPMN a technical focus, the intention of the BPMN designers  \nwas to develop a modeling language that can equally well be applied to typical busi-\nness modeling activities. This is clearly visible in the specification document, which \n466 M. zur Muehlen and J. Recker \nseparates the BPMN constructs into a set of  core graphical elements and an extended, \nmore specialized set. BPMN’s developers en visaged the core set to be used by busi-\nness analysts for the essential, intuitive articulation of business processes in very easy \nterms. The full set of constructs would then enable users to specify even complex \nprocess scenarios with a level of detail that facilitates process simulation, evaluation \nor even execution. This separation mirrors an emerging tendency in industry to sepa-\nrate business-focused process modeling from implementation-oriented workflow \nimplementation. \nThe evolution of BPMN closely mirrors the emergence of another modeling stan-\ndard, UML [2]. Both have been ratified by the standardization body OMG. Both con-\ntain a larger set of constructs in contrast to competing languages, and offer a multitude \nof options for conceptual modeling. Both have been found in analytical studies to be \nnot only semantically richer but also theoretically more complex than other modeling \nlanguages, [e.g., 3, 4]. And, in UML’s case, this complexity motivated users to deliber-\nately reduce the set of constructs for system analysis and design tasks. Related studies \nfound that frequently not even 20% of the constructs are used in practice [5, 6]. \nThe apparent complexity of the BPMN standard seems to be similar to the UML \nstandard, which raises a number of questions: Are BPMN users able – and willing – \nto cope with the complexity of the language? Does the separation into core and  \nextended constructs provided by the specification hold in modeling practice? And – \nreally – how exactly is BPMN used in practice? \nWhile BPMN has been receiving significant attention not only in practice but also \nin academia, virtually all contributions have been made on an analytical or conceptual \nlevel, [7, 8]. There are only few empirical in sights into how BPMN is used in practice \n– exceptions are reported in [9] and [10]. \nAccordingly, our research imperative has been to provide empirical evidence on \nthe usage of BPMN in real-life process modeling practice. The aim of this paper is to \nexamine, using statistical techniques, which elements of BPMN are used in practice. \nWe collected a large set of BPMN diagrams from three different application areas \n(i.e., consulting, education, process re-engineering) and analyzed the models regard-\ning their construct usage. This study is a first step to determine the most commonly \nused set of BPMN constructs and to provide the ecosystem of process modelers with \nspecific advice which elements of BPMN to use when. BPMN training programs \ncould benefit from a structure that introduces students to the most commonly used \nsubset first before moving on to advanced modeling concepts. \nWe proceed as follows: The next section briefly introduces the background of our \nresearch, viz., BPMN and our data sources, and presents our research design. Section \n3 presents the analysis results and discusses them. Section 4 concludes this paper with \na discussion of contributions, implications and limitations, and provides an outlook to \nfuture research. \n2   Background \n2.1   Introduction to BPMN \nThe Business Process Modeling Notation [1 ] is a recently published notation stan-\ndard for business processes. Its development has been based on the revision of other  \n How Much Language Is Enough? 467 \nnotations including UML, IDEF, ebXML, RosettaNet, LOVeM and Event-driven \nProcess Chains. \nBPMN was developed by an industry consortium (BPMI.org), whose constituents \nrepresented a wide range of BPM tool vendors but no end users. The standardization \nprocess took six years and more than 140 meetings, both physical and virtual. The \nBPMN working group developed a specification document that differentiates the \nBPMN constructs into a set of core graphical elements and an extended specialized set. \nThe complete BPMN specification defines 50 constructs plus attributes, grouped into \nfour basic categories of elements, viz., Flow Objects, Connecting Objects, Swimlanes \nand Artefacts. Flow Objects, such as events, activities and gateways, are the most basic \nelements used to create BPMN models. Connecting Objects are used to inter-connect \nFlow Objects through different types of arrows. Swimlanes are used to group activities \ninto separate categories for different functional capabilities or responsibilities (e.g., \ndifferent roles or organizational departments). Artefacts may be added to a model \nwhere deemed appropriate in order to display further related information such as proc-\nessed data or other comments. For further information on BPMN refer to [1]. \nExisting research related to BPMN includes, inter alia, analyses and evaluations, \n[e.g., 9, 11], use in combination with other grammars, especially BPEL [7], or its \nsupport for workflow concepts and technologies [8]. This and other research is mostly \nanalytical in nature. Few insights exist into the practical use of BPMN, which has \nmotivated our study. \n2.2   Data Sources \nIn order to arrive at an informed opinion about the use of BPMN in practice we col-\nlected BPMN models from three types of sources: A search using Internet search \nengines for “BPMN model” resulted in 57 BPMN diagrams, obtained from organiza-\ntions’ web sites, from practitioner forums and similar sites. These diagrams were \nlabeled in a variety of languages, but since our study focuses on the modeling con-\nstructs and not their content this was no hindrance. We collected an additional 37 \nBPMN diagrams from consulting projects to which we had access. These diagrams \ndepicted as-is and to-be processes from business improvement projects or software \ndeployment projects. An additional 26 diagrams were collected through BPMN edu-\ncation seminars taught by the authors. These diagrams were created by seminar par-\nticipants and depicted business processes from the participants’ organization. Overall, \nour data set consists of 126 BPMN models approximating the use of BPMN for a \nvariety of purposes including process (re-) design, education, consulting, and software \nand workflow engineering. 6 models were excluded from the analysis because they \nexplicitly illustrated nonsensical diagrams or were duplicates. \nWhile by no means do we claim our data set to be statistically representative of the \noverall use of BPMN in practice, it nevertheless gives us an informed opinion about the \nreal use of BPMN beyond the examples typically given by developers or tool vendors. \n2.3   Research Design \nHaving obtained a large set of BPMN models, our next step was to prepare these \nmodels for analysis. We created an Excel spread sheet counting the type of BPMN \n468 M. zur Muehlen and J. Recker \nconstructs in use per model. Each occurrence of a BPMN construct was marked as 1, \notherwise 0. This coding allowed us to treat the individual models as binary strings \nfor further analysis. In our coding effort, we kept track of the data sources for each \nmodel, which, for analysis purposes, we labeled ‘web’ (those models that we obtained \nfrom Internet search engines), ‘consulting’ (those that we obtained from consulting \nengagements) and ‘seminar’ (those obtained from educational seminars). \nThe resulting tables provided the basis for the application of statistical techniques \nsuch as cluster analysis, frequency analysis, covariance analysis and distribution \nanalysis. We employed analysis techniques available in Excel (frequency counts), \nMathematica (covariance matrices, Hamming distances) and R (cluster analysis). The \nfollowing sections provide further details about the exact application of the various \ntechniques used, and discuss the results we obtained. \n3   Analysis and Discussion \n3.1   Overall Use of BPMN Constructs \nBPMN offers 50 modeling constructs, ranging from Task and Sequence Flow to \nCompensation Associations and Transaction Boundaries. Our first question was: \nWhich of these symbols are used in practice and how frequently?  \nFig. 1 shows the frequency distribution of the individual BPMN constructs, sepa-\nrated by the three sample sets and ranked by overall frequency. Generally speaking, \nthe distribution of constructs follows a power-law distribution, with only four con-\nstructs being common to more than 50% of the diagrams: Sequence Flow, Task, End \nEvent, and Start Event. Notably, these constructs all belong to the originally specified \nBPMN core set [1]. \nFig. 1 shows that every model contained the Sequence Flow construct, and nearly \nevery model contained the basic Task construct (the diagrams that did not contain the \nTask construct used the Subprocess construct). The majority of Web and Seminar \nmodels contained Start and End Events, while the Consulting models replaced these \nwith more specific event types (e.g., Message or Timer Events for Start Events, Termi-\nnate, Message, or Link, for End Events). The other BPMN constructs were unevenly \ndistributed. A visual inspection of Fig. 1 leads to a number of interesting observations: \nWhile the majority of consulting models contained Data-based XOR Gateways \n(77%), Pools (81%) and Lanes (69%), these constructs were much less frequent in the \nother two sample sets (57%, 30%, 21% and 23%, 56%, 16% respectively for web and \nseminar models). This indicates that the consulting models depict organizational \nstructure in more detail than the random web sample. The majority of consulting \nmodels contained detailed Gateway constructs, whereas only ¼ of the seminar models \ndid not used them. This implies that beginning modelers tend to create diagrams with \nfew alternative or parallel flows. \nThe Web diagrams use (non-specific) Gateways frequently (observed in 55% of \nthe models), whereas the consulting and seminar sets make much less use of this \nsymbol (5% and 12%, respectively). Models in the web sample express the control \nflow logic of the diagrams in plain text (which can be inserted into the basic Gate-\nways), rather than the more formal XOR, AND, and Inclusive OR constructs. \n How Much Language Is Enough? 469 \n \nFig. 1. Occurrence Frequency of BPMN Constructs \nA sizable fraction of seminar models contain Intermediate Message constructs \n(41%) whereas only 7% of web models and 12% of consulting models contain this \nconstruct. This indicates that this construct is emphasized in BPMN classes but not \nvery common in practice. A potential explanation may stem from the underlying de-\nsign paradigm for process choreography in BPMN, which typically requires a lot of \ntime to explain in classrooms. Practitioners in general may not be fully confident in \n470 M. zur Muehlen and J. Recker \nthe use of these choreography concepts, which could be explain the less frequent \nusage of the related constructs. \n3.2   Frequency Distribution of BPMN Constructs \nThe ranked frequency distribution of BPMN constructs generally follows an exponen-\ntial (power-law) distribution, similar to long-tailed distributions that have been ob-\nserved as a result of preferential attachme nt [12]. This particular shape has been ob-\nserved previously in studies of natural languages, [e.g., 13, 14]. Fig. 2 shows a plot of \nthe frequency distribution of the BPMN elements in the three sample sets compared \nwith the Zipfian distribution [14]. \n \nFig. 2. Frequency Plot of BPMN Constructs by Rank \nZipf’s Law states that the frequency of words in natural languages is inverse to \ntheir rank (in other words, the second most frequent word is used 1/2 the time of the \nfirst, the third most frequent word 1/3 of the time, and so on) and has been observed \nin numerous contexts [see, for instance, 13]. While not a perfect fit, the BPMN sub-\nsets exhibit a distribution that is very close to the distribution of word usage in natural \nlanguages. This suggests that the use of BPMN constructs to design (graphical) state-\nments about organizational or system processes mirrors the use of natural languages. \nThis finding is of importance for future research on the way users learn, retain, and \nuse BPMN constructs, and – really – any other graphical modeling language. For \ninstance, linguistics research could be used to formulate conjectures about appropriate \nmodeling training programs – a still under-researched aspect of modeling research in \n How Much Language Is Enough? 471 \nIS. In general terms, the distribution of BPMN constructs shows that BPMN – as \nmany natural languages – has a few essential constructs, a wide range of constructs \ncommonly used, and an abundance of constructs virtually unused. Based on this ob-\nservation, training and usage guidelines can be designed to reduce the complexity of \nthe language to inexperienced analysts and to  deliberately build such models that can \nsafely be assumed to depict the core essence of a process without adding too much \ncomplexity. \n3.3   BPMN Construct Correlations \nHaving determined the most frequent set of BPMN constructs in use, we turn to some \nrelated questions: Which of the BPMN constructs are typically used in combination? \nWhich are used in alternation? In order to answer these questions, we used Mathe-\nmatica to generate covariance matrices, which allowed us to examine pairs of BPMN \nconstructs with regard to their combined or  alternative use. Those pairs of constructs \nwith negative covariance (p < -0.05) indicate alternatively used constructs while those \nwith positive covariance (p > 0.05) indicate constructs used in combination. Table 1 \nsummarizes the results. \nTable 1. Combined and alternative use of BPMN constructs \nConstructs with p > 0.05 Constructs with p < -0.05 \nData Object Æ Association Start Event Æ Start Message \nPool Æ Message Flow Gateway Æ Data-based XOR \nStart Event Æ End Event Text Annotation Æ Message Flow \nStart Message Æ Data-based XOR Start Message Æ End Event \nStart Message Æ Intermediate Message Start Message Æ Gateway \nStart Message Æ End Terminate Start Event Æ Data-based XOR \nPool Æ Lane End Event Æ Data-based XOR \nLane Æ Message Flow  \n \nOur findings present some interesting implications regarding BPMN modeling \npractice. Looking at the combined use of BP MN constructs (left column in Table 1), \nmost correlations confirm that BPMN modeling practice obeys the grammatical rules \nof BPMN. For instance, Data Objects need to be linked to flow objects via the Asso-\nciation constructs, Pools can only communicate with other Pools via message flow, \nLanes require Pools, and BPMN models require both Start and End Event. However, \nat least two interesting observations emerge . First, the positive correlation of Start \nMessage events with End Terminate events indicates a more sophisticated level of \nBPMN modeling, suggesting that when users start using the differentiated event con-\nstructs, they tend to use a variety of these. Similarly, the combined use of Start Mes-\nsage events with the Data-based XOR cons tructs indicates an advanced use of the \nlanguage for models in which different types of messages lead to different variants of \na process, depending on the actual content of the arriving message. \nLooking at the alternative use of BPMN constructs (right column in Table 1), we \ncan identify additional interesting patterns of BPMN use. For instance, the negative \ncorrelation between Gateway and Data-based XOR suggests that when modelers refine \nthe semantics of their models they choose the data-based XOR over the unspecific \n472 M. zur Muehlen and J. Recker \nGateway in order to clarify the control flow semantics of their models. The negative \ncorrelation between Text Annotation and Message Flow suggests that at initial stages, \nmodelers avoid choreography concepts and instead use free-form text to indicate mes-\nsage exchange. More advanced modeling relies on the provided semantic constructs \ninstead of simple textual additions. Similarly, the negative correlations between Start \nMessage event and the Gateway construct, and the Start/End Event and the Data-based \nXOR imply that modelers who refine the event constructs have achieved a level  \nof sophistication of language use at which they avoid the use of the non-descriptive \ngateways altogether and instead rely on the more differentiated gateway and event \nsubtypes. \n3.4   BPMN Construct Clusters \nIn addition to identifying pairs of constructs that are used alternatively or in combina-\ntion, we were also interested in uncovering whether clusters of BPMN constructs can \nbe found in practice. To that end, we perf ormed a hierarchical cluster analysis using \nthe Euclidian distance measure in order to classify the set of BPMN constructs into \ndistinct subsets. Fig. 3 shows the resulting dendrogram. \n \nFig. 3. Cluster Dendrogram of BPMN Constructs \nIn Fig. 3 six construct clusters are highlighted. First, the Task and Normal Flow \ncluster depicts the core of process modeling – the orchestration of activities that con-\nstitute a business process. Together with start and event conditions (through the use of \nevents), these clusters indicate the simplest form of depicting the essence of a process \nin a graphical model. A third cluster is comp rised of elements that are used to embel-\nlish and explain such process models through the use of text annotations, gateways \n(that specify control flow conditions of sequences of tasks) and data processing in-\nformation. Clusters four and five essentially denote additions to these core modeling \nconcepts by adding information about the organizational task allocation schemes, \n How Much Language Is Enough? 473 \nrequired roles and responsibilities as well as choreography information in collabora-\ntive scenarios, or refinements to the orchestration of the flow of the process through \ndifferent types of event and gateway constructs. The sixth cluster we found denotes \nthe set of constructs that are very simply not used at all (e.g., compensation associa-\ntion, end message, etc).  \nThe clustering of BPMN constructs provides a promising starting point for a com-\nplete ecosystem of BPMN users – vendors, consultants, coaches and end users alike. \nThese users can be guided in their efforts to learn and apply BPMN in an effective \nand efficient manner. Training programs, for instance, could focus on the ‘basic mod-\neling’ clusters first before teaching advan ced concepts such as organizational model-\ning and control flow orchestration. Coaches and consultants in charge of modeling \nconventions are guided by delineating the most common – and most frequently \navoided – BPMN constructs. \n3.5   Core or Extended Set? \nAccording to the BPMN specification, BPMN  modelers are envisaged to choose ei-\nther the core set of ten BPMN constructs, or an extended set in which these core con-\nstructs are modified (i.e., revised and extended). Our questions are: Do modelers use \ncore or extended constructs? Do they comply with the differentiation?  \nIn order to answer these questions we split the modeling constructs into 10 sets: \n• Tasks are split into Basic Tasks and an extended task set which contains the con-\nstructs for Subprocesses (collapsed and expanded) as well as Tasks with additional \nsemantics, such as Multiple Instance Tasks, Compensations, or Transactions. \n• Sequence flow constructs are split into a basic set (the Normal Flow) and an ex-\ntended set (consisting of Default Flow, Conditional, and Exception flow). \n• Gateways are split into the Basic (blank) XOR Gateway, and an extended Gateway \nset, which comprises Data- (X-labeled) and Event-based XOR, Inclusive-OR, and \nParallel Gateways. We contrast these two sets with the representation of routing in-\nformation through the Conditional Sequence Flow construct. \n• Events are split into the Basic Events, and an extended Event set including con-\nstructs such as Messages, Rule Events, Links, etc. \n• In addition we distinguished from these constructs Layout elements such as off-\npage connectors and the Grouping construct. \nFor these sets, we performed three separate frequency counts, for each of the three \ndata sets. The results are shown in Fig. 4. \nThe usage patterns exhibited in Fig. 4 shed some light on when users turn to ele-\nments from the extended set of BPMN constructs. First, while users tend to employ \nbasic task and sequence flow constructs, they mostly employ an extended set of gate-\nway constructs. Especially the sequence flow extensions are rarely used in practice. In \nterms of event constructs, basic and extended sets appear to be equally utilized. The \nfollowing additional observations can be made from the frequency analysis: \n• Consultants especially avoid extended task constructs and use mainly basic tasks. \nOn the other hand, they largely utilize the set of specialized gateway constructs. \n \n474 M. zur Muehlen and J. Recker \n \nFig. 4. Use of Core and Extended BPMN Constructs \n• Decision Sequence Flow constructs are very rarely used. This would suggest that \nBPMN users prefer the explicit decision routing representation capacity of Gate-\nways over the alternative, rather implicit way of annotating sequence flows. \n• Basic Gateways are dominant on the web. However, neither consulting nor seminar \nmodels use them in large numbers. This suggests that formal training (as exercised \nthrough seminar courses or trained consultants) leads to the use of precise seman-\ntics for articulating process orchestration. \n• Layout constructs are very rarely used. This suggests two things. First, language \nusers often use tool functionality to annotate diagrams (e.g., meta-tags, free form \ntags, navigation capacity). Second, it may be worthwhile externalizing such con-\nstructs from a modeling language in order to reduce their complexity. \n3.6   Complexity of BPMN Models \nPrevious studies on the usage of UML [5, 6] uncovered that the theoretical complex-\nity of a language (as measured by the number of constructs originally specified) often \nconsiderably differs from the practical comp lexity (the number of constructs actually \nused in a model). We are interested in whether a similar situation exists in the case of \nBPMN. In other words, while the theoretical complexity of BPMN is standardized by \nits specification [1], we wanted to measure the practical complexity of BPMN (i.e., \nthe vocabulary used in practice). To that en d, we contrasted the semantic complexity \nof the BPMN models we obtained (i.e., the size of the models) with their syntactic \ncomplexity (i.e., the number of semantically different BPMN constructs used in these \nmodels). Fig. 5 illustrates the results of this analysis. \n How Much Language Is Enough? 475 \n \nFig. 5. Syntactic Complexity of BPMN Models \nWhile the 50 BPMN constructs theoretically allow for 2 50 permutations, the actual \nnumber of usable subsets is much smaller. All BPMN models obviously require the \nuse of Tasks and Sequence Flow. Since the majority of models we observed used a \nBPMN vocabulary of between 6 and 12 constructs, the number of possible BPMN \nvocabulary subsets in practice is between \n  =194,580 and \n  = 6,540,715,896. \nGiven that 9 constructs in our sample were used by fewer than two models we can \nexclude these from the search space and arrive at a theoretical range from \n  = \n82,251 to \n  = 635,745,396. On average, we found the average number of semanti-\ncally different BPMN constructs to be 9 (consulting), 8.78 (web), and 8.7 (seminar), \nrespectively. However, while this finding indicates the size of the average BPMN \nvocabulary used in practice, it does not mean that every model with 9 BPMN con-\nstructs uses the exact same BPMN subset. In fact, a pair wise comparison of the 120 \nmodels revealed only 6 pairs of models that shared the same BPMN subset between \neach pair (i.e., there were 6 identical pairs of construct sets).  \n3.7   Variety of BPMN Subsets \nIn order to determine the variety of BPMN subsets, we computed the Hamming Dis-\ntance [15] for each model vocabulary. Originally, the Hamming distance between two \nstrings of equal length is the number of positions for which the corresponding sym-\nbols are different. In other words, it measures the minimum number of substitutions \nrequired to change one into the other. In the case of BPMN, we treated each model \nvocabulary as a 50-bit binary string, where a positive bit at position i signals the usage \nof BPMN construct [i]. The Hamming Distance between two model vocabularies then \nindicates the number of bits that differ between the two vocabularies, in other words \nthe discrepancy between the BPMN constructs used in the creation of two models. \nThe results are visualized in Fig. 6. \n476 M. zur Muehlen and J. Recker \n   \nFig. 6. Hamming Distance of BPMN Vocabularies \nThe average Hamming distance for the three subsets was 7.6 (web), 7.5 (consult-\ning), and 8.8 (seminar), indicating a slightly more diverse use of BPMN constructs by \nnovice modelers, whereas the web and consulting sets were slightly more homogene-\nous (but not by much). These metrics indicate that the average dissimilarity between \ntwo BPMN subsets is 7-8 constructs. A common scenario would be that one model \nuses 4 BPMN constructs that the other model does not exhibit and vice versa. As \nBPMN becomes more prevalent we plan on observing this metric over time, to see \nwhether the commonly used vocabularies become more homogeneous over time. \nAnnotating these BPMN subsets with context information (e.g., the process modeling \npurpose), in turn, could provide a starting point for deriving the most suitable BPMN \nsubsets for a variety of application areas. \n3.8   The Common Core of BPMN \nOur evaluation thus far has focused on the individual elements and their grouping into \ncore and extended constructs. However, one of our questions relates to the subset of \nBPMN constructs that are shared by different models. While we found six pairs of \nmodels that each share a complete set of co nstructs, there are subsets that are shared \nby more than two models. Figure Fig. 7 shows a Venn diagram of different BPMN \nconstruct combinations. The number in the corner of each grouping indicates the \nnumber of models that contained this specific subset of the language. We included \ncombinations of constructs that were shared by more than 10 models. \nThe most apparent subset is the combination of Tasks and Sequence Flow – 97% \nof the models we analyzed shared this subset, and those that did not used a representa-\ntion for tasks from the extended BPMN set (e.g., Subprocess). The addition of Start \nand End Events is the next most common subset – used by more than half of the mod-\nels we analyzed. The following subsets show an interesting pattern: Either modelers \nfocus on process orchestration  through by adding gateways and their refinement to \ntheir models, or they focus on process choreography  and add related organizational \nconstructs, such as Pools and Lanes. While the addition of Pools leads to a subset that \nis common in nearly 30% of all models, the addition of Lanes halves this fraction. \n How Much Language Is Enough? 477 \nAdding Basic Gateways or Parallel Gateways to the core set leads to a subset that is \nshared by 20% of all models. The popularity of the Data-based XOR Gateway and the \nParallel Gateway construct indicate that they are a core element in many modeler \nvocabularies, even though the BPMN specification places them in the extended set of \nthe language. The same situation holds for Message and Timer Events (both Start \nEvents and Intermediate Events). While other event types were used very infre-\nquently, these two event types were the most popular addition to the core modeling \nset in lieu of unspecified events. \n \nFig. 7. Most popular BPMN Vocabulary Subsets \nOverall, BPMN models appear to fall into two main sets (indicated in Fig. 7 by ho-\nrizontal versus vertical grouping). The horizontal groups contain tasks, basic events \nplus constructs for separating organizational duties and responsibilities (Pools and \nLanes). Consultants will use these types of models will most likely for organizational \n(re-)engineering and process improvement. The vertical groups add to this set of con-\nstructs refined constructs for specifying the exact control flow of processes (through \nvarious gateway types) as well as the exact event conditions pertaining to a process \n(i.e., various event construct types). This is not shown in Fig. 7 in the interest of clar-\nity. Overall, this set of BPMN construct co mbinations can be expected to be favored \nby designers and analysts seeking to articulate the precise flow conditions, for in-\nstance, in the context of workflow engineering or process simulation rather than the \norganizational responsibilities (depicted by Lanes or Pools). \nAn interesting property of the BPMN subsets is their frequency distribution. The \nranked frequency distribution again follows an exponential distribution, mirroring the \nbehavior of individual BPMN constructs. This suggests that modelers use blocks or \nsubsets of BPMN constructs in a similar fashion as they use individual constructs. \n478 M. zur Muehlen and J. Recker \nCombinations of BPMN constructs can thus be treated as metawords and be analyzed \nas such. \n4   Contributions, Limitations, and Outlook \nIn this paper we studied the use of BPMN in actual process modeling practice. We \nobtained 126 (120 considered) BPMN models and used a wide range of statistical \ntechniques to shed light onto the practical  complexity afforded by the use of BPMN. \nOur paper makes a key contribution to the growing area of process modeling by re-\nflecting on empirical data about the use of a rising industry standard. The most impor-\ntant finding is that the complexity of BPMN in practice differs considerably from its \ntheoretical complexity. This, in turn, suggests that future research should take this \ndistinction into account when considering BPMN’s expressive power, complexity or \nother features or characteristics. Our study shows that the frequency of BPMN con-\nstructs follows an exponential distribution, both at the elementary level and the subset \nlevel. This means that the practical use of a formal modeling language shows similari-\nties to the use of natural language, and suggests that linguistic techniques can be ap-\nplied to better understand the formation and use of languages in conceptual modeling \noverall. We see an opportunity for replicating our study with other standardized mod-\neling approaches (e.g., UML) to obtain further evidence for this conjecture. \nOur findings have major implications, both for language developers and the organ-\nizational ecosystems in which modeling languages are used. Our findings point to \nsome areas of concern in current language standardization practices, which appear to \nprefer language extensions (more expressive languages) to language revision (more \nlean languages). Our findings indicate that this may be to some extent contradictory to \npractical usage. Also, our findings motivate organizations to invest resources into \nconventions management  in order to be able to manage and limit the complexity \nbrought to bear by the languages employed for process modeling. \nThe presented research findings have to be contextualized in light of some limita-\ntions. First, the source of empirical evidence is limited to three sets of data sources \nand 126 BPMN models overall. We also did not consider any longitudinal data (e.g., \nthe evolution of BPMN models through various iterations). However, we made an \neffort to collect data from multiple application areas and to consider these in our \nanalysis. While we grouped the models by origin, we did not have sufficient informa-\ntion about the model content to analyze the models based on their intended use. We \nperformed a hierarchical cluster analysis on the models themselves, but did not iden-\ntify significant clusters. While this supports the random nature of our sample, it con-\ntradicts one of our expectations – that there is a clear differentiation between BPMN \nmodels depending on their intended use. \nIn future research, we will continue our data collection and extend it with more \ncontext-related information, e.g., for what purpose were the models created, what \ntypes of modelers created the models etc. This will allow us to triangulate our find-\nings with contextual variables so as to arrive at informed opinions about BPMN usage \nacross a wide range of application areas. In a related stream of research, we will apply \na number of complexity metrics [e.g., 16] to the identified BPMN clusters to make a \nstatement about how complex the frequently used BPMN constructs subsets are. \n How Much Language Is Enough? 479 \nReferences \n1.
