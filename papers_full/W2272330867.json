Therefore, this work\nhas the potential to significantly change the decision-making process and may become an\nimportant asset in choosing sustainable flood mitigations and adaptation strategies.\nKeywords Flood · Visualization · Decision-making · Large-scale rendering\n1 Introduction\nClimate changes already have drastic implications for rainfall and ocean levels, and\nthe situation is likely to worsen (Barros et al. 2014). Over 50 % of the world popu-\nlation lives in cities (WHO 2013) and more than two thirds of the largest cities are\nvulnerable to rising sea levels as a result of climate change (McGranahan et al. 2007).\nHence, millions of people are therefore exposed to the risk of extreme floods and\nstorms.\nDeveloping strategies to mitigate or to adapt to the threats of floods is an impor-\ntant topic in the context of climate changes. Several countries and unions, including the\nEuropean Union (EU), have put a multi-layer safety approach into place as a framework\nfor the development of these mitigation and adaptation strategies (EU 2005). The multi-\nlevel safety approach consists of three layers. Layer 1 focuses on protection measures\nin the form of levees and dikes and has traditionally received most attention and fund-\ning (Kabat et al. 2009). For example, in the Netherlands, a 5-year maintenance cycle as\nwell as a standardization for reinforcements has been established (STOW A 2008). Layer\n2 consists of waterproof spatial planning, while layer 3 considers disaster management.\nExamples of mitigation measures through spatial planning (layer 2) are local protection\nof hospitals, schools, and utility companies or spatial planning measures that improve the\nchances of evacuation from a flooded area. Flood disaster management (layer 3) can be\nimproved by setting up disaster protocols and practicing decision-making under worst-case\nscenarios.\nOne of the main challenges for following a multi-level safety approach is the inte-\ngrated decision-making process it requires. This means that different practitioners, related\nto the three layers mentioned above, have to collaborate and find integrated solutions for\nMitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324 309\nflood management. These practitioners include policy analysts or political decision-makers\nfrom municipalities, water boards, and provinces or representatives from fire and police\ndepartments, hospitals, and energy companies.\nIn this process, it is important to build the capacity among these practitioners for involve-\nment in flood management. Analytical tools, e.g., Sobek (http://www.deltaressystems.com/\nhydro/product/108282/sobek-suite) or Mike11 (http://www.mikebydhi.com), can be used to\ngain insight into the consequences of floods under different climate scenarios or alterna-\ntive measures in terms of water depths, flow velocities, or damages. They offer predictions\nby simulating the physical processes involving various area features such as elevation and\nroughness resistance and external forces such as storm events and dam breaches (Al-Sabhan\net al. 2003; Bates and Roo 2000;M o e la n dA e r t s2011; Stelling 2012a). To address model\nuncertainties, analytical tools are normally validated with historical events or when such\nmeasurements are not available, a sensitivity analysis or ensemble calculations can be\ncarried out (Walker et al. 2003).\nUp to the present, analytical tools have only been accessible to domain experts, such as\nhydraulic engineers and modelers, as the involved simulation processes are complex and\nrely on computational and data-intensive models. Practitioners (i.e., policy analysts and\npolitical decision-makers) are usually only presented with resulting maps. Typically, these\nindicate the impacts of individual flood hazards or the results of risk analyses, in which\nmultiple hazard scenario’s, each having a certain likelihood, are combined into risk maps\n(Apel et al. 2004).\nDespite the advantages that these maps may provide for practitioners of flood man-\nagement, poor use is often made of this information for supporting decisions (Leskens\net al. 2014b). Mors et al. (2005) show that practitioners of flood management, oper-\nating under regulatory, institutional, political, resource, and other constraints, priori-\ntize other concerns over more sophisticated maps with model information about flood\nrisks. An underlying reason might be the difference in perception of the threats of\nfloods between domain experts, such as modelers or hydraulic engineers, and prac-\ntitioners (Faulkner et al. 2007;J a n s s e ne ta l .2010; Timmerman et al. 2010; Wood\net al. 2012). Domain experts generally frame flood issues using scientific knowledge\nand expertise. They assume that with more detailed model, information analyses will\nimprove and better decisions can be made. Practitioners, on the other hand, often lack\nthe capacity and time to incorporate the results of these complex analyses in their\ndecisions.\nA way to better support practitioners with the output of analytical tools is to improve\ntheir involvement in the application of these tools (V oinov and Bousquet 2010;L e s k e n s\net al. 2014b). This involvement can improve the alignment of the information require-\nments of practitioners with the opportunities and limitations of analytical tools (Leskens\net al. 2014a). However, as mentioned, the existing analytical tools are only accessible to\ndomain experts, as the involved simulation processes are complex and rely on computa-\ntional and data-intensive models. These analytical tools have specialized interfaces and their\napplication—for example, to picture a future flood scenario—takes multiple hours (Leskens\net al. 2014b).\nIn this paper, we present a system that is focused on making the use of flood anal-\nysis tools accessible for practitioners of flood management, such that they can carry\nout flood analysis together with domain experts in interactive work sessions. The sys-\ntem gives the user the possibility to test several disaster scenarios and to receive direct\nvisual feedback. It provides realistic images to help practitioners in interpreting these out-\nputs of the system. We conducted a user study to test the effectiveness of this interface\n310 Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324\nand its outputs. In order to investigate the applicability in practice, we illustrated the use\nof our system for real-world data in a case study for the area of West-Friesland, The\nNetherlands.\nThis work makes a two-fold contribution: 1) we present a working system and show the\nutility of our approach, and 2) we explain the technical contributions needed to achieve a\nworking solution. The paper offers an overview of our system and its possibilities, focusing\non interaction and visualization. We also give a description of the novel techniques that have\nbeen used. The results of two tests are presented.\n2 Our system\nIn this section, we explain how the system was developed and give an overview of the\nkey features and their technical backgrounds. For more detailed descriptions, we provide\nreferences to other publications.\n2.1 Development of the system\nThe system presented here builds upon a prototype developed between 2011 and 2014,\ninvolving researchers and engineers from Delft University of Technology, Deltares, and\nNelen & Schuurmans.\nThe key features of the system are based on user requirements that were derived from 13\nsemi-structured interviews among policy analysts of the regional water board Hoogheem-\nraadschap van Delfland (The Netherlands), conducted in 2011 and reported in Leskens et al.\n(2014a). The interviews focused specifically on three questions. (1) What is your task or\nrole in decision-making processes? (2) What information do you require to carry out this\ntask? (3) What functions do you need from an analysis tool that can be operated during\na work session? From these 13 interviews, it emerged that the following capabilities were\nconsidered important for using an analysis tool during a work session with domain experts:\n(1) technical reliability, (2) the possibility to assess the effectiveness of multiple scenar-\nios within the time horizon of a work session, and (3) understandable output for non-water\nspecialists.\nBased on these user requirements, the key features of our system focus on a realistic\nvisualization of floods and interactivity to enable practitioners to explore various options for\nflood mitigation and adaptation measures rapidly, together with domain experts. To ensure\ntechnical reliability (i.e., the first user requirement), our system combines a high spatial\nresolution (i.e., 0.5 m by 0.5 m) and the inclusion of all relevant processes (i.e., overland\nflow, groundwater flow, canal flow, and sewer flow) (Stelling2012b).\nThere are other flood analysis tools available that provide comparable features and user\ninterfaces (N ´obrega et al. 2008; Bates and De Roo 2000). However, our system is unique\nin providing the distinct features in the required scale ( >1000 km\n2) and resolution ( >10\nheight values per square meter). Making an interactive system with a realistic visualization\nfor such large areas is a very challenging goal.\n2.2 Overview\nThree dimensional (3D) visualization Our 3D visualization is aimed at supporting prac-\ntitioners in interpreting and understanding the impact of simulated flood hazards. It shows\nthe properties of simulation results in three spatial dimensions and a realistic rendering,\nMitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324 311\nmapped to real-world phenomena. In respect to two dimensional (2D) visualizations, in\nwhich the impacts of flood hazards can only be viewed directly from above, the 3D visu-\nalization shows the impacts also from the side. Flood depths can therefore be examined\nwithout the use of a legend in which typically different shadings of blue are used to indicate\nthe depth of a flood. The basis for this realistic 3D visualization is data from Light detection\nand range (LiDAR) scans coupled to output of water simulations. LiDAR data is collected\nby a technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analyzing\nthe reflected light. The result of these LiDAR scans, usually carried out by helicopters, are\npoints specified in three spatial dimensions (x, y, z), with a resolution of around 15–50 points\nper square meter. These points, colored via aerial images, ensure recognition of the area and\nits features (e.g., houses, cars, and trees) in high detail. Water properties, based on the sim-\nulations, are projected realistically into this 3D visualization. For example, flow directions\nare visualized by moving waves and water depth is displayed by adjusting the light extinc-\ntion. Furthermore, the system supports stereo rendering to create the illusion of depth, if\nthe corresponding equipment is available. Extensive interactive device support gives users\nthe possibility to navigate the 3D world with ease. This also allows us to adapt the sys-\ntem’s navigation to the cognitive and motoric capacities of different audiences (e.g., general\npublic, museum visitors, decision-makers, managers, hydrologists, etc.). Our system builds\nupon an efficient out-of-core rendering system that displays large-scale light detection and\nranging (LiDAR) data (Haan2009, 2010; Kehl and de Haan2012). Even though large-scale\npoint-based rendering is a classic rendering topic (Dachsbacher et al. 2003; Rusinkiewicz\nand Levoy 2000), a solution that combines large-scale water and terrain visualizations was\npreviously unavailable.\nInteraction For interaction with the simulation process, our system relies on a sim-\nulation display that shows the map of the study area (Fig. 1). Different from the 3D\nvisualization system, as presented in the former section, the study area in the simulation\nFig. 1 A screenshot of the 2D interface used for interaction\n312 Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324\ndisplay can only be viewed directly from above. Once a simulation is carried out, the\noutcome can be presented in the 3D visualization system and be viewed by a helicopter\nperspective.\nA user can choose two different methods to add water flows to the study area. First, a\npoint source can be added, consisting of a flow discharge or a water level. This point source\ncan, for example, be used to simulate a dam breach or a leaking sewer pipe. Second, a\nspatially distributed source can be added, consisting of a flow discharge to a selected area,\nwhich can be used to simulate rainfall events. Several properties can be selected for both\ntypes of water sources, for example, whether the flow discharge of a point source is constant\nor time-dependent, or whether the distributed discharge has a circular or an irregular shape.\nThe impact of these sources on the area can be assessed simultaneously with the simulation\nprocess. The water depths are indicated by a dynamic blue overlay and can also be assessed\nby a graph on random points or over a random cross section. Flow velocity is indicated by\nbubbles in the water.\nAside from the various options to add water sources, the properties of the study area’s\nterrain can be adjusted as well. This can be done in three ways. First, the elevation of\nthe area can be locally increased or decreased—for example, to simulate the effective-\nness of digging passages in local elevations that obstruct water flowing to storage areas\nor to test the effectiveness of elevating levees with sand bags. Second, the land use type\ncan be changed—for example, to increase the rainwater infiltration capacity of the ground\nby changing paved areas into unpaved areas. Third, the water system in the study area,\nconsisting of canals, pumps, weirs, and culverts, can be adjusted—for example, to test the\neffectiveness of stronger pumps, broader canals, or higher weirs.\nAdding water sources to the study area and adjusting the study area itself can be done at\nany time by the user during the simulation process. The simulation can also be stopped to\nmake adjustments to the water sources or the study area, after which the process is resumed.\nThe display is made accessible via an internet browser. Therefore, users do not need to\ninstall special software on their computers. In case multiple users access the system at the\nsame time, one of the users has the authority to make adjustments to the simulation. This\ndepends on the pre-specified user rights.\nThe interactive character of the simulation display, as described above, is made\npossible by a strong computation core. This computation core consists of numerical\nmethods to solve the 2D hydraulic equations for water flow, under the conditions of\nshort computation times while still conserving the details of the study area. The tech-\nnical details of this flood simulation model can be found in Stelling ( 2012b)a n d\nCasulli and Stelling (2013).\n2.3 T echnical contributions\nSeveral hurdles were overcome to obtain a system that is accessible to practitioners who\nare no domain experts. We added four extensions to the existing 3D visualization tech-\nniques (Haan 2010; Kehl and de Haan2012;K e h le ta l .2013). First, we introduce a solution\nto directly manipulate the LiDAR point sets to improve collaborative aspects. Second, we\npresent a new visualization technique to add rainfall information. Third, we developed a\nscalable solution for water rendering to make it possible to investigate large-scale flood-\ning scenarios. Finally, our system can be easily executed on network-connected display\ndevices, hereby abstracting the used hardware—whether it be a single screen, a multi-screen\nsetup, or a stereo device. In the following, we will give a short overview of these technical\ncontributions.\nMitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324 313\nDirect interaction with data points To facilitate discussions and support multi-user\ninteraction, we designed a web-based solution for collaborative interaction that allows\nconcurrent users to highlight areas or even modify data. The aforementioned changes in\nthe simulation display (terrain lifting, soil changes, etc.) and annotations can be trans-\nferred directly to the virtual 3D LiDAR model. The on-the-spot visualization of concurrent\nchanges on 3D topographic models of comparably sized datasets has not been demonstrated\nbefore within the scientific geospatial community. Our solution also allows highlighting of\nareas via common user interfaces, such as Lizard, Google Maps, or Open Street Maps to\nensure a good acceptance of the system among the various users. Such possibilities can be\nhelpful for discussions by directly visualizing the impact of the suggested solutions (Isen-\nberg et al. 2013). The input applications can be executed on widely used smart devices (e.g.,\ntablets and smartphones), making our algorithms accessible to a wide audience.\nThe modifications can manipulate any point property, such as color, but also height.\nThe algorithm reads as an input keyhole markup language (KML) files, which are readily\nproduced with the abovementioned software packages. These 2D polygonal definitions are\nshared among various users, who can then concurrently define modifications.\nTechnically, the approach modifies the LiDAR points on the fly by restricting the changes\nto the points that are currently visible to the observer in the 3D visualization software.\nHereby, we avoid treating the entire data set, which would be too large to allow for interac-\ntive rates. Each LiDAR point is localized on the fly via a hierarchical structure build from\nthe user-defined polygonal areas in the KML file (Kehl et al. 2013). The latter stores in\neach area the wanted attribute modification. This modification can then be applied to the\nlocalized LiDAR point, prior to being drawn on the screen.\nRainfall visualization Previous 3D visualization systems produced realistic imagery\nfrom simulation data, which improves understanding for practitioners. In this work, we fur-\nther introduce a rainfall data visualization, which is particularly interesting for urban floods;\ndense construction (e.g., buildings, pavements, roads) and their disadvantageous infiltration\nproperties lead to water accumulating on the pavement.\nFig. 2 Cloud reflection for a flood in the city of Rotterdam due to a hypothetical scenario of heavy rainfall\n(100 mm/h)\n314 Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324\nIn order to naturally embed precipitation information in a realistic 3D visualization,\nwe developed a method to render, dynamically update and animate clouds according to\nmeasurements provided by the Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut (KNMI).\nFigure 2 shows an example of the reflection of these clouds for an urban flood scenario\nin the city of Rotterdam, but the cloud layer is also directly visible, e.g., in a top-down\nview. We render satellite imagery (Holleman et al. 2009) as a realistic cloud layer, posi-\ntioned 10 km above the ground, that is streamed in real-time into our 3D visualization\nsoftware.\nWater rendering The rendering of large-scale water bodies is particularly challeng-\ning. No previous solution existed to directly render the results of hierarchical simulation\nprocesses (Stelling 2012b), despite the fact that such scenarios are very common in the\ninvestigation of large-area impacts.\nThe challenge is that the simulation relies on an approximation in the form of an adaptive\nquadtree, which respects water properties. These data sets, even in a hierarchical represen-\ntation, are too large to be displayed entirely at real-time rates. Hence, an efficient display\nmethod is needed to simplify the representation. This adaptive scheme should be based on\nthe viewing distance to add details only in the proximity to the observer, where they are\nneeded.\nThe problem relates to terrain-rendering solutions, but previous work used a uniformly\nsampled height field (Losasso and Hoppe 2004; Baboud et al. 2011), while we need\nsupport for the hierarchical simulation results. Additionally, we want to support wave pat-\nterns to illustrate the underlying water properties, but previous work synthesized waves\nindependently of any underlying simulation data (Ren and Zhou 2012) or did not allow\nfor view-dependent simplifications (Kryachko 2004). These aspects are crucial for our\nlarge-scale data sets.\nIn our approach, we load and display only the simulation results that are currently in\nview. We use a hierarchical grid attached to the camera location that is very close to the\nobserver and coarser in distance. As such, the grid resolution respects the distance to the\nobserver. To transform this grid into a water representation, its vertices recover information\nfrom the underlying hierarchical flood simulation by querying the hierarchical structure\nbased on their position. Depending on the stored water properties (presence, height, flow,\nand velocity), the vertices are displaced to represent the water levels and the recovered\nvalues are interpolated across each grid cell, which enables us to apply a texture-based\nwave-synthesis algorithm (van Hoesel 2011).\nDisplay setups We designed a display algorithm that distributes the workload among\nnetwork-interconnected rendering machines. Such a solution makes it easy to run our solu-\ntion on various 2D displays, multi-display setups, as well as 2D and 3D stereo projector\nsystems. This is an interesting aspect as different visualization setups are common (Marton\net al. 2012;R e d ae ta l .2013; Kuchera-Morin et al. 2014).\nSince particularly high-resolution results involve extensive computations in order to\nmaintain interactivity at a high quality, our approach allows the involvement of multi-\nple computers, which all contribute to the final images by sharing their results over the\nnetwork. To illustrate the generality of this solution, we tested several different screen\nsetups (screen walls of various screen arrangements, stereo devices, and cylindrical pro-\njection, as shown in Fig. 3). We also refer the interested readers to the accompanying\nvideo.\nMitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324 315\nFig. 3 Multi-screen setup, visualizing the city of Delft on a three-screen panorama\n3 Flooding analysis\nTo test whether the two key features of our system (i.e., realistic visualization and interac-\ntivity) can contribute to a better accessibility of flood analysis tools for practitioners and\nsupport collaborative flood analyses with domain experts, we carried out two tests. The first\nwas aimed at the usability of our system for individual practitioners who are no domain\nexperts. The second was a use case to test whether our system could support collaborative\nflood analysis with practitioners and domain experts in a real-world application.\nWe gathered the data input for our system from the aerial LiDAR scan AHN2 (Actueel\nHoogtebestand Nederland - www.ahn.nl) together with satellite imagery. The data was fur-\nther augmented by object databases and soil maps provided by the Dutch Water Boards and\nconversion tables to transform land use into infiltration rates, as well as roughness, inter-\nception, permeability, and porosity values (CultuurtechnischeVereniging1998). In common\nmodeling practices, preferably a calibration and validation with real measured data is\napplied to assure the validity of the model outcomes. However, our case study was focused\non testing the interface and user interaction and therefore a validation and calibration with\nreal measured data was not necessary, although in this test, the outcomes had to be within a\nreasonable range of likelihood to be of use to the users.\n3.1 User study\nIn this part, we evaluate the usefulness of our system for practitioners of flood management,\nwho are usually no domain experts. To this end, we asked the participants to perform an\nanalysis themselves and to comment on different types of visualizations obtained by our\nsystem.\n3.1.1 Participants\nSeven subjects participated in our study (5 males and 2 females, aged between 24 and 46—\nthe mean age was 30). All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. While they were not\nfamiliar with the system and goals, they all had experience in working with computers.\n3.1.2 Methodology\nThe experiment took around 15 min per participant, including instructions, test, and subjec-\ntive feedback. It consisted of two parts: (1) a comparison between a simulated flood hazard\n316 Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324\nFig. 4 A simulated flood hazard in the Watergraafsmeer area represented with an illustration directly from\nabove (2D) and a helicopter view (3D).\nrepresented with a illustration directly from above (2D) and a helicopter view (3D) (Fig. 4)\nand (2) an assignment in which the interactive simulation display was used.\nFor part 1 of the experiment, a flood was simulated in a study area in Amsterdam called\nWatergraafsmeer. The calculated maximum water depths of this simulation where projected\nin two ways. First, our 3D visualization system was applied, in which the user could make\na realistic helicopter flight over the flooded area. Second, a conventional 2D visualization\nwas applied, consisting of a digital map (Google), in which the maximum water depths\nwhere projected that could only be viewed directly from above (see Fig.4). We showed both\nvisualizations to each participant individually and asked them to respond to three closed\nquestions and one open question:\n1. Which visualization is best suitable to estimate damages to houses? [options: 2D, 3D,\nneutral]\n2. Which visualization is best suitable to estimate loss of lives? [options: 2D, 3D, neutral]\n3. Which visualization is best suitable to estimate whether evacuation is necessary?\n[options: 2D, 3D, neutral]\n4. Does the 3D visualization have added value in respect to the 2D visualization and, and\nif so, what is this added value? [open question]\nIn part 2 of the experiment, the participants were asked to use the interaction possibilities\nto study the area Watergraafsmeer in Amsterdam. First, an introduction to our system was\ngiven to explain how the simulation display works. Second, the participants were given the\nopportunity to familiarize themselves with the simulation display. No explicit time limit was\ngiven for this. When they indicated that they understood how the simulation display had to\nbe operated, they were asked to give an answer to the following question: which streets in\nthe study area will be inaccessible for cars after a rain shower of 100 mm in 1 h? The time\nit took to answer this question was then measured.\n3.1.3 Apparatus\nWe used an Intel Core i7 at 2.67 GHz processor, 6 GB of main memory, and an NVIDIA\nQuadro FX380 card with a 20-in. Samsung 2233RZ (120 H, 1680 × 1050 pixels) screen,\nand the participants used a classic three-button mouse device for interaction. For the\n3D visualization, the main device uses an Intel Xeon 6 core hyperthreaded processor @\n3.2 GHz, 12 GB of main memory, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680 with a common\nscreen (60 Hz, 1920 × 1080 pixels) attached.\nMitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324 317\nTa b l e 1 The table presents the questions that where asked to each individual participant and, per question,\nthe number of participants preferring a 2D/3D visualization\nQuestion 2D Visualization 3D Visualization Neutral\nWhich visualization is best suitable 2 5 0\nfor the estimation of damages to\nhouses?\nWhich visualization is best suitable 2 5 0\nfor the estimation of loss of lives?\nWhich visualization is best suitable 3 3 1\nfor the estimation whether evacuation is necessary?\n3.1.4 Results user study\nThe responses to the closed question in part 1 of the test (i.e., the comparison between a 2D\nand 3D visualization of the same flooded area) are listed in the table below (Table 1)\nThe open question about what the added value of the 3D visualization was with respect\nto the 2D visualization was answered with the following statements:\n– It makes it better possible to imagine the consequences of the flood.\n– It enhances prediction of what a flood means for an area and helps to better empathize\nwith the situation.\n– It is more realistic and detailed. It is easier to interpret what a flood means for the area.\n– It is more vivid and therefore better understandable.\n– Less interpretation is required to estimate the consequences of the flood.\n– It helps the user to better imagine how serious the flood is.\n– It shows the consequences for the environment better.\nThe average time the participants needed to answer which roads would not be accessible\nfor cars after a rain event of 100 mm was 6 min, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum\nof 7.\n3.2 Case study\nTo test whether our system is accessible for both model experts and practitioners such\nthat they can carry out flood analysis together in an interactive way, we organized a case\nstudy. This case study was organized together with the Province of North-Holland and the\nWaterboard Hollands Noorderkwartier in the Netherlands. Various stakeholders of the pilot\narea West-Friesland were invited to a workshop to discuss flood mitigation and adaptation\nmeasures within the multi-level safety approach.\nThe West-Friesland area is a large, flood prone area (781 km\n2), located north of Amster-\ndam and lies approximately 3 m under sea level. It is protected by dikes from water in the\nIJsselmeer/Markermeer-lake. The area is inhabited by approximately 400,000 people.\n3.2.1 Set-up case study\nA broad workshop was organized to create a decision-making environment in which vari-\nous stakeholders in the area were informed about the threats of floods and were involved in\n318 Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324\ninvestigating mitigation and adaptation measures in spatial planning and flood disaster man-\nagement. During the workshop, the stakeholders were separated into groups to answer the\ncentral questions: “Which measures can be taken?” and “How can these measures be imple-\nmented?”. Ideas of the stakeholders, resulting from their own backgrounds and perspectives\non the threats of floods, could immediately be tested and discussed using our system. The\nsystem was also used to produce maps ahead of time. The results are the following four\nmaps, each post-processed per flood scenario:\n1. Flooded roads: highways, secondary, and urban roads\n2. Flooded utility companies: divided into electricity, gas, and water\n3. Flooded vulnerable objects; hospitals, day care centers, generated schools, and old age\nhomes\n4. Arrival times in order to provide information for planning evacuations.\nFigure 5 shows an example of the arrival times of a simulated flood and Fig. 6 indicates\nthe accessibility of roads.\n3.2.2 Participants\nThirty-five stakeholders attended the workshop. This group existed of representatives of the\nprovince of North-Holland (official organizer of the workshop), the Waterboard, munic-\nipalities, agriculture, business, project developers, energy providers, health service, fire\nFig. 5 Arrival times—an exemplary map showing flood arrival times in different zones, which can be used\nfor city evacuation planning\nMitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324 319\nFig. 6 Accessibility of roads—another map resulting from the system that shows the mitigation of the flood\n(left) and the road access in the study area ( right) accordingly.

These stakeholders covered most of the parties\ninvolved in choosing mitigation measures. Apart from five domain experts from a consul-\ntancy company and the water board who where used to applying analysis tools, most of the\nother participants were not used to involvement in the application of analysis tools.\n3.2.3 Results case study\nThe work session yielded a number of measures that were proposed by the participants and\ncould be directly tested with our system. The measures were assigned to responsible stake-\nholders for further elaboration. An overview of these measures is listed in Table 2. One of\nthe measures that emerged during the workshop, which is considered to be of high poten-\ntial, was dividing the area in different components by dry dikes (Fig. 7). The evaluation of\nthe use of our system in the workshop indicated that a combination of interaction with the\nsystem and the realistic visualization allows the users to quickly judge the effectiveness of\nFig. 7 One investigated measure for flood protection is shown in this figure. The illustration shows the effect\nof dividing the area of West-Friesland in a southern part and a northern part by a dry dike (red line) at both\ndam breach locations\n320 Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324\nTa b l e 2 Flood mitigation and adaptation measures that were proposed by the participants of the work session\nand could be directly tested with our system\nStakeholder Measure Elaboration\nProvince Include water safety in water Use official strategic plan for\nregional planning spatial planning and raise and\nmaintain regional roads in order\nto provide evacuation routes\nMunicipality Incorporate water safety in building Adapt official building standards\nstandards and regulations\nWater board Create awareness and inform Apply the water system to reduce\nstakeholders on water safety the consequences of floods, for\nexample, by using compartments\nin discharge canals\nSupply flooding data and\ninformation on a non-expert level\nApply the water system for flood\nreduction and practice\nSuppliers of energy Ensure drinking water during Keep pumping stations dry and\nand water flooding events, by keeping the assure emergency power supply\nsystem under pressure (Electricity Redirect mobile communication\nsupply and communication supply towards flooded area\nsystems tend to break down easily)\nCompanies and Take private measures in case the Take local measures such as dikes\nentrepreneurs level of protection ensured by the around the property\nwater board is not enough\nInhabitants Take private measures to survive Prepare a survival kit\nfor a longer period in case of\nflooding\nEmergency services Switch from procedural scripts to Enhance evacuation scripts and\n(fire departments, scenario-related evacuations the supply of information during\npolice) calamities\nThe measures were assigned to responsible stakeholders for further elaboration\nthe solutions suggested in the various flood scenarios. The 3D visualization was considered\na benefit over conventional 2D visualizations on maps. Users indicated that it was easier to\nestimate the impact of the calculated flood with the 3D visualization as they could relate\nthe flood depths directly to familiar objects, such as trees, cars, and houses. With 2D visu-\nalizations, users first have to translate the different shades of blue into flood depths and\nthen estimate the impact of the calculated flood. The positive impact on decision-making\nwas attributed to the possibilities of testing the effectiveness of measures in a direct way.\nIn the past, the effectiveness could only be evaluated by the intervention of model experts\nand was presented in a following work session. The post-processed map layers that illus-\ntrate additional information, such as damage, hindrance, and costs allocation, were deemed\nextremely useful for gaining additional insights beyond the physical values, such as water\nMitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324 321\ndepths or flow velocity. Furthermore, this representation addressed the legal responsibilities\nof the different stakeholders.\n4 Discussion\nThe results of our user study show that our system is accessible and usable for users who are\nnot domain experts like hydraulic engineers or model specialists. First, the 3D visualization\nhelped most of the participants to better understand the consequences of a flood scenario\nin terms of damages, loss of life, and the urgency to evacuate in respect to the 2D visu-\nalization. In the open question about the added value of the 3D visualization over the 2D\nvisualization, all participants agreed that the 3D visualization helped them to better imag-\nine what a flood means for an area. Second, it was shown that these non-expert participants\nall were able to use our interactive simulation display. Moreover, they were able to carry\nout an expert analysis about the availability of roads after a heavy rain event within min-\nutes. With conventional models, which have specialist user interfaces and require hours of\ncomputation time, this would not have been possible.\nThe case study showed that our system was usable for collaborative application by prac-\ntitioners and domain experts. The simulation display was effectively used on the level of at\nleast three aspects. First, it enabled practitioners from different backgrounds to understand\nwhat floods meant for their specific field of profession. Second, it helped these practition-\ners to contribute in suggesting suitable solutions, following the multi-level safety approach.\nThird, the simulation display helped the practitioners to retrieve direct feedback on the\neffectiveness of their suggested solutions.\nOur results show that our system is accessible for practitioners of flood management\nsuch that they can carry out flood analysis together with domain experts in interactive work\nsessions. However, one should be careful to draw general conclusions about the apprecia-\ntions of our system. In our case, the simulation display and 3D visualization were mainly\nused for a general exploration of solutions which on the short term have no direct financial\nor political consequences. The impact of the decisions and the time pressure for making\nthese decisions were therefore low. It is expected that our system will be used differently\nwhen time pressure and consequences are high. Experiences show that decision-makers in\nthese circumstances highly value the accuracy of the outcomes of a model (Brugnach et al.\n2007).\nWe expect that interactive modeling can contribute to a better understanding of uncer-\ntainties in model outputs among decision-makers as they can directly examine if current\ndata were used in the model setup. They can also see how suggested solutions are trans-\nlated into the model and therefore better understand the scope of the outcomes. Still, a\ncalibration and validation with real measured data, as applied in common model practices,\nis always advisable. However, in environmental problems related to climate changes, the\nfuture is unpredictable and the nature of the relationship between processes is sometimes\nunknown (Leedal et al. 2010). In these cases, different model concepts or variation in input\ndata in ensemble calculations can be considered (Renner et al. 2009;W a l k e re ta l .2003).\nMethods to cope with model uncertainty, such as the use of real measured data or ensemble\ncalculations, are all applicable with our system.\nRegarding the technical aspects of our studies, we report that our system is efficient\nenough to be executed on a standard desktop PC, as reported in Section 3.1.3. For all sce-\nnarios, we could ensure a framerate of roughly 20 frames per second, which leads to a good\ntradeoff between speed and accuracy. Figure 8 shows a few images from a flythrough with\n322 Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change (2017) 22:307–324\nFig. 8 Our system is interactive and maintains a stable framerate. Here, we show an evolving flood during a\nreal-time flythrough on a standard desktop computer\nan evolving flood. The interaction component was executed on a tablet but would run on\nmost web-capable devices, which is a big advantage as it makes a large part of our system\naccessible anywhere and to anyone.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we presented our system for analyzing flooding scenarios. We showed that,\ndespite the complexity of the involved models and the size of the involved data sets, our\nsystem is accessible for practitioners of flood management such that they can carry out flood\nanalysis together with domain experts in interactive work sessions. In particular, the realistic\n3D visualization helps practitioners, who are no domain experts, to better estimate the scale\nas well as the impact of a flood. The simulation display allows them to interact with the\nsystem and to explore complex flooding scenarios. Both results have been demonstrated in\na user study and a case study, showing that our system represents an important step ahead\ntowards the closer involvement of practitioners in the analysis driving the decision-making\nprocess for developing mitigation and adaption strategies for the threats of floods.\nThe accessibility of our system can also be underlined by the fact that a modified ver-\nsion was recently installed in two museums in The Netherlands, namely the Delft Science\nCenter, as well as the Watersnoodmuseum in Zeeland. The two installations rely on our 3D\nvisualization system to illustrate the impact of the 1953 flooding, which led to an enormous\ndestruction of large parts of the Netherlands. Our solution gives people a direct access to\nflood-related information and offers insights into decision-making for flood mitigation and\nadaption strategies.\nAcknowledgments The necessary software development, testing procedures, and use cases were collec-\ntively supported and funded by the waterboards Delfland and Hollands Noorderkwartier and by the national\nresearch program of “Knowledge for Climate” 1. “Knowledge for Climate” furthermore offered a commu-\nnication base for sharing insights and arranged collaborations with other research teams.
