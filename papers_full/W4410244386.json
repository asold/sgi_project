Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced\nconversational agents have revitalized the ﬁeld of multi-agent systems, whose roots in\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence predate the current rise of generative AI. Historically, multi-agent\nsystems have relied on agents with relatively limited capabilities; however, the emergence\nof powerful, conversational LLMs greatly expands the range of possible multi-agent\ninteractions. In this new paradigm, humans themselves can participate as full-ﬂedged\nagents, thanks to their innate conversational and decision-making abilities. The result is\na complex, interconnected ecosystem (\nHopf et al., 2024 ).\nFrontiers in Human Dynamics /zero.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org\nBorghoﬀ et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fhumd./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum./one.tnum/five.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/six.tnum\nSimultaneously, novel and more direct forms of human-\nAI integration are emerging ( Pareschi, 2024 ; Saghaﬁan and\nIdan, 2024 ), in which advanced AI cognition is harnessed to\ncreate “Centaurian” intelligence—a seamless fusion of human and\nmachine-driven capabilities.\nThese developments push beyond traditional HCI in two\ndistinct directions that mirror fundamental patterns found in\nbiological systems (\nBorghoﬀ et al., 1995 ; von Bertalanﬀy, 1968 ;\nMiller, 1978 ). Multi-agent systems, like biological ecosystems,\nemphasize how collections of autonomous entities can coordinate\neﬀectively while preserving distinct boundaries and roles. In\ncontrast, “Centaurian” systems pursue deeper integration—\nanalogous to the symbiotic relationships in nature—fusing human\nand artiﬁcial competencies in tightly knit partnerships that\noften blur the lines between human decision making and AI-\ndriven processes. Living systems theory (\nMaturana and Varela,\n1980) helps us understand how both approaches must address\na core challenge: maintaining system identity through regulated\nboundaries and feedback loops (\nWiener, 1948), whether in loosely\ncoupled collectives or tightly integrated hybrid intelligences.\nFrom an ethical and regulatory perspective, the blurring of\nboundaries between human and artiﬁcial agents raises critical\nissues of accountability and transparency. As hybrid systems\nincreasingly share decision-making authority between human and\nAI components, especially in domains such as healthcare, defense,\nor ﬁnance, it becomes essential to ensure traceable paths of\naction and deﬁne clear loci of control. By preserving observable\ncommunication layers and explicit transitions, our architectural\nmodel supports auditability and human oversight even in deeply\nintegrated Centaurian conﬁgurations. While our goal is primarily\nanalytical rather than normative, we recognize that formal clarity\nin modeling is a prerequisite for ethical deployment.\nHerbert Simon’s inﬂuential work on cognitive architectures\n(\nSimon, 1996) provides additional insight into how such human-AI\nintegration might be structured. His tripartite model—comprising\nan external interface, a coding mechanism, and an internal\nprocessing system—was originally conceived to explain human\nproblem-solving but extends naturally to hybrid systems. When\nhuman abilities merge with artiﬁcial intelligence, the resulting\nconﬁguration can evolve from traditional tool use ( Homo Faber )\nto a more profound integration ( Centaurus Faber ) where each\ncomponent may be instantiated by either human cognition or AI\nsubsystems (\nPareschi, 2024). This perspective suggests how system\nboundaries might be organized to support both autonomous\noperation and deep integration.\nThe framework proposed in this paper serves a dual purpose:\nﬁrst, as a design methodology for structuring hybrid human-\nAI systems, and second, as an analytical lens for understanding\ntheir coordination dynamics. While not prescriptive in a regulatory\nsense, it oﬀers a normative foundation for evaluating the degree and\nquality of integration between agents. Its modular structure also\nallows it to be adapted for formal veriﬁcation and implementation\nin real-world systems.\nTo address these architectural challenges, we introduce a formal\nframework based on Petri nets (\nPetri, 1962 ; Murata, 1989 ) that\ncan model both multi-agent and Centaurian paradigms while\nsupporting the key requirements suggested by living systems theory\nand Simon’s architecture: clear boundaries, regulated interactions,\nand adaptive feedback loops. Unlike graph-based agent frameworks\n(\nWooldridge, 2002 ; Weiss, 2013 ), which prioritize topological\nrelationships but struggle with dynamic concurrency, Petri nets\noﬀer native support for parallel processes and state transitions via\ntoken semantics, critical for hybrid human-AI systems. Colored\nPetri nets (\nJensen, 1995 ), in particular, allow us to encode\nheterogeneous data, agent roles, and interaction semantics—\nkey to modeling learning, adaptation, and reasoning in hybrid\nagent conﬁgurations.\nOur approach, grounded in rigorous process modeling,\nprovides a uniﬁed way to specify how heterogeneous agents—\nhuman and artiﬁcial—can coordinate their activities while either\nmaintaining autonomy or achieving deeper integration as needed.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 analyzes two fundamental paradigms in human-machine\ncollaboration—the multi-agent approach and the Centaurian one—\nin light of the recent resurgence of agentic AI. Section 3 provides\nfoundational background on Petri nets and their extensions.\nSection 4 introduces the concept of communication spaces as\na unifying framework for these paradigms, grounded in formal\narchitectures and coordination mechanisms. Sections 5 and 6\nillustrate these ideas with two use cases, demonstrating how\ncommunication spaces can be applied in practical HCI scenarios.\nSection 7 discusses related work, and Section 8 concludes with\nimplications and future directions.\n/two.tnum Paradigms in human-AI integration\nAgentic AI systems have reinvigorated two distinct approaches\nto human-AI collaboration: multi-agent architectures and\nCentaurian integration. This section examines these paradigms in\ndetail, highlighting the distinct challenges each presents for system\ndesign and coordination.\nIndeed, although both paradigms involve interactions between\nintelligent entities, they represent fundamentally diﬀerent\napproaches to human-artiﬁcial collaboration (\nPareschi, 2024 ).\nMulti-agent systems maintain distinct boundaries between\ncomponents while enabling complex interactions, much like\nnatural ecosystems. In contrast, Centaurian systems mirror\nthe tight integration seen in biological organisms, where\ncomponents merge functionally to create new capabilities\n(\nSaghaﬁan and Idan, 2024 ).\n/two.tnum./one.tnum Architectural diﬀerences\nThe primary architectural distinction lies in how these systems\norganize and maintain their identity ( Pareschi, 2024).\nMulti-agent systems (MAS) emphasize functional\nindependence, where agents—human or artiﬁcial—operate as\ndistinct entities with decision-making capabilities and dynamic\ncollaboration. This design has allowed MAS implementations\nto thrive even with relatively simple AI agents, focusing on\ncoordination rather than deep integration.\nCentaurian systems, by contrast, create uniﬁed composite\nentities where human and artiﬁcial components become\nfunctionally interdependent. Theoretical foundations for such\nsystems trace back to\nLicklider (1960) and Engelbart (1962) , but\nFrontiers in Human Dynamics /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org\nBorghoﬀ et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fhumd./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum./one.tnum/five.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/six.tnum\ntheir practical feasibility has emerged only recently with generative\nAI systems capable of complementing human cognitive functions.\nA key concept in both systems is that of communication\nspaces—regions of interaction where information exchange and\ncoordination occur. In biological systems, these are signaling\npathways or neural networks; in human-machine systems, they\nmanifest as protocols, interfaces, and shared representational\nspaces (\nBradshaw et al., 2011 ). These spaces enable “joint\nactivity”, characterized by inter-predictability, common ground,\nand directability.\n/two.tnum./two.tnum Integration paradigms, operational\ndynamics, and convergence points\nEach paradigm embodies diﬀerent principles from living\nsystems theory: In MAS, collaboration occurs through well-\ndeﬁned protocols between autonomous agents, resembling distinct\norganisms in an ecosystem. Eﬀectiveness emerges from collective\nbehavior while maintaining individual identities. In Centaurian\nsystems, integration blurs the boundaries between human and\nartiﬁcial components, forming functionally uniﬁed entities similar\nto biological organisms.\nThe ecosystem versus organism analogy extends to\noperational dynamics:\n• Identity maintenance: MAS preserve distinct agent identities\nwhile allowing interaction while, Centaurian systems create\nnew composite identities through integration.\n• Adaptation mechanisms : MAS adapt via reconﬁguration of\nagent relationships, while Centaurian systems evolve through\ninternal transformation of integrated components.\n• System boundaries : MAS maintain clear boundaries with\nwell-deﬁned interfaces, while Centaurian systems develop\npermeable boundaries for deep functional integration.\nDespite these distinctions, some scenarios blur the boundaries\nbetween paradigms, especially in adaptive complex systems.\nConsider large action models (LAMs), where human operators\nprovide training feedback to artiﬁcial systems. Depending on\nthe context, these interactions can manifest as multi-agent\ncollaboration or Centaurian integration. Such convergence points\nsuggest that while the paradigms are conceptually distinct, they can\ncomplement each other in practice.\n/two.tnum./three.tnum Implications for system design\nViewing these paradigms through the lens of living systems\ntheory has key design implications: The MAS design focus\nis on preserving agent autonomy, developing protocols for\neﬀective coordination, and ensuring system resilience through\nindependent agents. Centaurian systems , on the other hand, have\na design focus on emphasizing functional integration mechanisms,\ndeveloping shared representational spaces, and encouraging\nemergent capabilities.\nSection 4 will introduce communication spaces as a unifying\nframework supporting both paradigms, thus enabling both the\nloose coupling of MAS and the tight integration of Centaurian\nsystems while preserving their core attributes.\n/two.tnum./four.tnum Situating human-machine\ncollaboration in the context of agentic AI\nAdvances in agentic AI heighten the relevance of multi-agent\nand Centaurian systems. Unlike traditional AI chatbots, agentic AI\nsystems engage in sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to\nsolve complex, multi-step problems autonomously. These systems\nfollow a four-step cycle of perception, reasoning, action, and\nlearning, continuously improving over time.\nOur framework provides a theoretical foundation for\nintegrating agentic AI into human-machine collaboration. It\nis intended to be used primarily for system design, analytical\nmodeling, and normative assessment. The multi-agent paradigm\naligns with contexts where agentic AI must maintain autonomy\nwhile coordinating with human and artiﬁcial agents via deﬁned\nprotocols—such as in distributed customer service or collaborative\nsoftware development.\nConversely, the Centaurian paradigm is critical for cases that\nrequire deep integration with human operators, such as healthcare\nor video analytics, where AI seamlessly blends with human\nexpertise and decision making. The tight coupling characteristic\nof Centaurian systems enables ﬂuid interactions for complex tasks\nthat require human judgment alongside AI-driven analysis.\nAs agentic AI systems grow more sophisticated, the interplay\nbetween these paradigms becomes more dynamic. For instance,\nan enterprise AI system might operate independently (multi-agent\nmode) for routine tasks while tightly integrating with human\nexperts (Centaurian mode) for complex decisions. Our framework\nsupports the understanding and design of such interactions.\nAdditionally, the “data ﬂywheel” eﬀect—continuous learning\nand adaptation—aligns with our model’s emphasis on system\nevolution. Learning occurs both in the improvement of\nindependent agents (multi-agent paradigm) and in the reﬁnement\nof human-AI integration patterns (Centaurian paradigm),\ndemonstrating how our framework accommodates various aspects\nof agentic AI development.\n/three.tnum Technical background: Petri nets\nTo provide a rigorous foundation for modeling the complex\ninteractions in both multi-agent and Centaurian systems, we\nemploy Petri nets as our core formal framework. Petri nets\npresent several advantages for our purpose: they oﬀer a\nclear graphical representation while maintaining mathematical\nprecision, they naturally capture concurrent processes and\nsynchronization requirements, and they can be extended to handle\nsophisticated data types and conditions through their colored\nvariants. These properties make them especially well-suited for\nmodeling interactions among heterogeneous agents, whether in\nloosely coupled multi-agent conﬁgurations or tightly integrated\nCentaurian systems. This section introduces the key concepts of\nPetri nets and their extensions, which will serve as the formal basis\nfor our communication spaces framework.\nFrontiers in Human Dynamics /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org\nBorghoﬀ et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fhumd./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum./one.tnum/five.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/six.tnum\nPetri nets are a well-established formalism for describing and\nanalyzing the ﬂow of information and control in concurrent\nsystems. Originally introduced by\nPetri (1962) , they have evolved\ninto a family of models widely applied in computer science, systems\nengineering, and workﬂow management. A Petri net consists of\nplaces, transitions, and arcs connecting places to transitions (or\nvice versa), with the system’s state captured by tokens that reside\nin places. As transitions ﬁre, tokens move among places, thus\nmodeling the progress of a process or distributed computation\n(\nMurata, 1989).\n/three.tnum./one.tnum Basic concepts and advantages\n• Graphical clarity : One of the key strengths of Petri nets\nis their visual nature. Processes, resource constraints, and\nsynchronization points are represented in a diagram, oﬀering\nan intuitive view of concurrent interactions. This makes Petri\nnets well-suited for communicating system designs to both\ntechnical and non-technical stakeholders.\n• Explicit concurrency : Petri nets explicitly capture\nconcurrency by allowing multiple transitions to ﬁre\nindependently if they have suﬃcient tokens in their input\nplaces. This feature provides a natural way to represent\nmulti-agent or multi-component systems where actions may\nproceed in parallel.\n• Formal analysis tools: A rich ecosystem of analysis techniques\n(e.g., reachability, liveness, boundedness) and software tools\n(e.g., colored Petri nets Tools\n/one.tnum) exists for verifying properties\nof Petri net models ( Jensen, 1995 ). This is particularly useful\nfor systems requiring rigorous guarantees, such as safety-\ncritical applications or complex human-AI workﬂows.\n• Modularity and extensibility : Petri nets provide a modular\nframework that can be extended to various specialized forms\n(e.g., timed, stochastic, colored), allowing the designer to\nincorporate speciﬁc features such as timing constraints,\nprobabilistic behavior, or typed tokens.\n/three.tnum./two.tnum Colored Petri nets and typed tokens\nWhile classical Petri nets use indistinguishable tokens to\nmark places, colored Petri nets extend this model by assigning\ntypes or colors to tokens. Places become typed containers, and\ntransitions can incorporate guard functions that enable more\ncomplex behaviors (\nJensen, 1995 ). This extension allows designers\nto encode complex data structures and interaction protocols\ndirectly in the net, signiﬁcantly increasing expressiveness. In the\ncontext of hybrid agent systems, colored Petri nets are especially\nadvantageous for:\n• Heterogeneous agents: Diﬀerent types of tokens can represent\nmessages, tasks, or capabilities unique to human and\nsynthetic agents.\n/one.tnumhttps://cpnide.org/\nFIGURE /one.tnum\nA simple Petri net example showing two places and one transition .\n• State and context tracking : Color sets can capture the internal\nstate of agents or system contexts, allowing transitions to ﬁre\nonly when certain conditions (guards) on those states are met.\n• Protocol deﬁnition and enforcement : Complex interaction\nsequences, including the dynamic creation and distribution of\ntasks, can be succinctly speciﬁed and analyzed.\n• Integration with communication spaces : As we will see in\nSection 4, communication spaces—surface, observation, and\ncomputation—can be mapped onto distinct parts of a colored\nPetri net, leveraging types to separate or coordinate diﬀerent\ncommunication and processing domains.\n/three.tnum./three.tnum Illustrative example\nFigure 1 presents a simpliﬁed Petri net modeling a small\nconcurrent process. Places are shown as circles, transitions as\nrectangles, and arcs indicate the ﬂow of tokens.\nIn a colored Petri net version (\nFigure 2), tokens carry additional\ndata types that reﬂect the roles or tasks assigned to diﬀerent agents.\n/three.tnum./four.tnum Relevance to hybrid agent systems\nPetri nets, and particularly their colored variants, are\nideally suited to represent the parallel and event-driven nature\nof interactions among humans and AI components. Their\ntoken-based semantics naturally handles concurrency, while the\nability to extend tokens with data types makes them powerful\nenough to capture the complexities of heterogeneous, hybrid\nagent systems.\nAs we will see in the next section, Petri nets’ properties—\nparticularly their ability to model concurrent processes,\nhandle heterogeneous data types, and support both loose\nand tight coupling—make them ideal for implementing\nthe communication spaces framework, which addresses the\ncoordination challenges identiﬁed in our discussion of multi-agent\nand Centaurian paradigms.\n/four.tnum Communication spaces and agent\narchitectures\nThe contrasting requirements of multi-agent and Centaurian\nparadigms—maintaining clear boundaries in one case while\nenabling deep integration in the other—call for a uniﬁed framework\nFrontiers in Human Dynamics /zero.tnum/four.tnum frontiersin.org\nBorghoﬀ et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fhumd./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum./one.tnum/five.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/six.tnum\nFIGURE /two.tnum\nA colored Petri net where tokens carry types or data, allowing condi tional transitions.\nthat can support both approaches. While Petri nets provide a strong\nformal foundation for modeling processes and synchronization,\nwe need to extend their capabilities to capture the complexities of\nhuman-AI collaboration fully. We introduce communication spaces\nas this unifying framework, building on Petri nets while adding\nspecialized structures for handling varied communication styles,\nheterogeneous capabilities, and adaptive protocols.\n/four.tnum./one.tnum Foundations and rationale\nPetri nets excel at modeling token ﬂows among well-deﬁned\nplaces, but in hybrid human-AI systems, we face additional\nchallenges. Agents diﬀer widely in perceiving, processing, and\nsharing information: humans communicate through natural\nlanguage, AI systems through structured data, and physical devices\nthrough sensor signals. Moreover, these communication patterns\nmust adapt dynamically as the system shifts between loose coupling\n(characteristic of multi-agent systems) and tight integration\n(needed in Centaurian conﬁgurations). These requirements call\nfor a framework that can accommodate asymmetric interaction\ncapabilities while supporting both autonomous operation and deep\ncognitive fusion.\nA mini-example of heterogeneous agents\nConsider a team as shown in\nFigure 3 with a human operator,\nan LLM-based conversational agent, and a swarm of simple robotic\ndrones. The human and LLM exchange strategic decisions via\ntext-based conversation, while the drones communicate real-time\nstate updates in a lightweight sensor-data format. Additionally,\nthe human observes a video feed of drone activity. Each of these\n“channels” imposes diﬀerent synchronization rules, data formats,\nand reliability guarantees—precisely the nuances communication\nspaces help formalize.\n/four.tnum./two.tnum Core ideas of communication spaces\nCommunication spaces group interactions into three\nconceptual layers (\nBorghoﬀ et al., 2024a ): surface, observation,\nand computation. Whether in a multi-agent (MAS) or a\nCentaurian system, each space encapsulates a coherent set\nof interaction rules and constraints. The formation of these\nspaces typically involves either point-to-point or broadcast\ncommunication\n/two.tnum, or communication through the environment /three.tnum.\nSeveral examples illustrate this multi-agent organization of\ncommunication spaces:\n• In Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs), mobile devices\ncommunicate with one another via wireless links without\nrelying on an underlying infrastructure: each device acts\nas both an endpoint and a router forwarding messages to\ndevices within radio range. Software support for MANETs\ntypically presents a coordination layer that sends speciﬁc\nmessages to individual agents to guarantee the execution\nof cooperative processes while considering the need for\nconnectivity continuance. In\nBottoni et al. (2006) , a formal\nmodel of the coordination mechanisms was given in terms of\nHigh-Level Petri nets.\n• Management of transportation networks requires maintaining\ncomplete information on the whereabouts of vehicles and\nthe state of roads to be mapped on the topology of the\ntransportation network (see\nCiancia et al. (2018) for a concrete\nexample). Then, the overall state of the transportation system\nis given by the information of which vehicle is at which\nnode of the network, information which has to be maintained\nconsistently for each vehicle.\n/two.tnum Point-to-point or broadcast communication often uses message passing\nas a crucial concept in many system interactions, especially i n distributed\nsystems, concurrent programming, or event-driven architecture s like ours.\nIt allows diﬀerent components (agents, large action models, etc.) t o\ncommunicate without internal knowledge of the other system (decoup ling),\nmaking it easy to add more components to a messaging-coupled system\n(scalability). Even diﬀerent messaging protocols can be easily implemented\nand exchanged spontaneously (ﬂexibility), with some protocols all owing\nasynchronous interaction in which the sender and receiver do not\nhave to work simultaneously (asynchrony).\nXiao et al.

(2006) , a computational\nmodel was derived from how ants communicate information\non trails to reach food sources by marking them through\npheromones recognized by other ants. The computational\nmodel was, therefore, based on associating weights to paths\nto a result and strengthening those associated with a\nsuccessful one.\nFigure 4 shows a layered architecture similar to the Model-\nView-Controller (MVC) paradigm, where executive agents\nimplement the actual computations, observer agents realize\na bridge between the computations, thereby managing the\nformatting of data for presentation and decoding user interactive\ncommands and data entry, and surface agents (or mediators)\nare responsible for maintaining the presentation of the overall\nstate to the users, thereby managing the materialization of the\nformatted data and the presentation layout, and providing support\nfor capturing user interactions.\nNote that in this architecture, the actions performed by the\nexecutive agents, and not just their results, can be subject to\nobservation. Vertical structuring is also shown, relating surface\nagents and executive agents through an observation space (see\nFigure 5).\nSurface space\nThis space mediates all contact with the outside environment—\nuser interfaces, sensors, and external APIs. In MAS, surface space\ntypically involves message-passing protocols or event listeners. In\nCentaurian systems, it can reﬂect a direct blending of human\nsensory input and AI-driven data capture.\nFrontiers in Human Dynamics /zero.tnum/six.tnum frontiersin.org\nBorghoﬀ et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fhumd./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum./one.tnum/five.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/six.tnum\nFIGURE /five.tnum\nSchematization of communication spaces in the proposed architec ture.\nObservation space\nBridging the surface interface with internal processing,\nobservation space handles message transformations, routing,\nand light coordination. In MAS, protocols here ensure agents\nremain autonomous yet cooperative. In Centaurian systems,\nobservation may feature continuous feedback loops that unify\nhuman perception with AI analysis.\nComputation space\nServing as the “core” of the system, the computational space\nmakes decisions, allocates resources, and generates ﬁnal outputs.\nMAS solutions often involve multiple autonomous modules, each\ncoordinating a portion of the computation. In contrast, Centaurian\narchitectures could fuse human insight with AI algorithms in a\nshared decision-making environment.\nFlows and feedback\nInformation travels vertically through these spaces—from raw\ninput at the surface to internal processing and back. There may also\nbe horizontal ﬂows where agents collaborate within a given space.\nFeedback loops enable adaptive behavior, such as reﬁning protocols\nor redistributing tasks in real time based on performance.\nEach of these spaces can be seen as managed by an associated\ngroup-agent, facilitating distributed problem-solving among a\ngroup of users within a networked system or application. The\nstructure of a group-agent is schematized in\nFigure 6, where the\nID and ST compartment are common to all agents. Then, the\nCOMPOSITION compartment is speciﬁc to a group-agent, while\nother agents have speciﬁc additional members for deﬁning their\nstate, and are endowed with a set of behaviors.\nGroup-agents are relevant in collaborative systems where\nmultiple users and agents work together to solve complex problems\nor tasks and proper delivery of messages is crucial to ensure\nthat each participant is correctly informed of the overall progress\ntoward task achievement. A group-agent can be created at any\ntime with respect to a topic and its register behavior regulates\ncomposition modiﬁcation through a protocol which respects the\nlocalization constraints.

This approach partitions a net into self-contained\n“zones”, each governed by speciﬁc interaction rules and constraints.\nMulti-agent architecture\nIn a multi-agent system, surface agents manage user\ninteractions and detect events from the environment, acting\nas the system’s interface with external inputs. Observer agents\nensure smooth communication by transforming and routing\nmessages, enabling coherent collaboration among autonomous\ncomponents. Meanwhile, executive agents operate within the\ncomputational space, executing specialized tasks and maintaining\na partial system state to support overall functionality.\nA key beneﬁt is clear boundary maintenance and scalability:\neach agent type can be added or removed with minimal impact on\nthe others, provided communication protocols remain consistent.\nCentaurian architecture\nIn Centaurian systems, a uniﬁed interface layer merges human\nand AI sensory input within the surface space, creating a\nseamless interaction point. A shared observation layer acts as a\nbridge between human and AI representations, facilitating smooth\ncognitive fusion. Meanwhile, a hybrid processing layer integrates\nhuman reasoning with algorithmic methods, allowing for emergent\ncollective problem-solving.\nSuch architectures thrive on adaptability, where boundaries\nare permeable and agents can ﬂuidly exchange roles or data to\noptimize performance.\n/four.tnum./four.tnum Formal representation with colored\nPetri nets: communication space Petri net\nWe extend colored Petri nets to create a Communication Space\nPetri net , where places are partitioned into surface, observation,\nand computation categories.

For example, transitions in the observation\nspace can ﬁre only when tokens of type “parsed command” are\npresent, ensuring that raw data never bypasses the necessary\ntransformation steps.\nExample snippet\nImagine a transition as shown in\nFigure 7 in the computation\nspace labeled Assign Task, which ﬁres only when it receives both\na “planning token” from the LLM agent and an “approval token”\nfrom the human. Such a rule encapsulates the synergy sought in\na Centaurian design, formalizing how human sign-oﬀ triggers an\nAI-based planning process.\n/four.tnum./five.tnum Implementation considerations\nImplementing communication spaces requires careful attention\nto the following aspects: State management ensures consistent\nupdates across distributed agents or fused human-AI modules,\nespecially in time-sensitive environments. Resource allocation deals\nwith balancing computational load, bandwidth, and potential real-\ntime constraints. Protocol adaptation supports switching between\nagent autonomy (MAS) and deeper integration (Centaurian) based\non changing system goals or unexpected conditions.\nA system may operate predominantly in MAS mode for routine\ntasks, yet temporarily shift to a more Centaurian-like strategy\nwhen it encounters novel or ambiguous conditions. This capacity\nto blend paradigms on demand underscores the ﬂexibility of\ncommunication spaces.\nThe beneﬁts can be summarized as follows: By demarcating\nsurface, observation, and computation spaces within a\nuniﬁed Petri net model, designers gain a clear blueprint\nfor structuring agent interactions. This approach enables\nthem to capitalize on the strengths of both multi-agent and\nCentaurian paradigms—maintaining well-deﬁned boundaries\nwhen necessary, but also allowing for deep integration and\nemergent capabilities where advantageous. The next sections\nillustrate how communication spaces operate in real-world\nscenarios, further emphasizing their role in building robust\nhuman-AI systems.\n/five.tnum Use case /one.tnum: multi-agent interaction\nwith satellite and swarm robots\nThis use case demonstrates how our theoretical framework\naccommodates both multi-agent and Centaurian paradigms within\na complex system.

The multi-\nagent paradigm is evident in how distinct entities—the satellite\ncontrol unit, swarm robots, LLM, and human operators—maintain\ntheir functional independence while collaborating through well-\ndeﬁned protocols. However, the system also exhibits Centaurian\ncharacteristics at certain points of interaction, particularly at the\nhuman-LLM interface. The overall information and decision ﬂow,\ndescribed in detail in the following sections, is shown in\nFigure 9.\n/five.tnum./one.tnum System overview\nThe system exempliﬁes the multi-agent paradigm through\nits composition of distinct, autonomous components: a satellite\ncontrol unit, a swarm of robotic agents, an LLM, and human\noperators. Each agent maintains its own decision-making\ncapabilities while participating in the collective process. The\nsatellite provides centralized coordination and processes the data\ncollected by the swarm, while the LLM oﬀers strategic advice on\nalgorithm selection and parameter tuning. The human operators\nare not just supervisors, but autonomous agents who monitor these\ninteractions and intervene to guide the system through complex\ndecision processes.\n/five.tnum./two.tnum Integration with LLM and human\noperators\nThe integration layer demonstrates a hybrid approach that\ncombines both paradigms. Following the multi-agent paradigm, the\nLLM interacts with the blockchain and control algorithms as an\nindependent agent, providing a ﬂexible intelligence layer. However,\nthe interaction between human operators and the LLM exhibits\nCentaurian characteristics, creating a tightly coupled decision unit\nwhere human judgment and AI recommendations are seamlessly\nintegrated. This dual-nature system remains robust and adaptive\nthrough both the independent operation of its components and the\nsynergistic human-AI integration points.\n/five.tnum./three.tnum Practical applications\nThe practical applications show how the two paradigms\ncomplement each other. For path optimization and adaptive\nproblem solving, the system primarily operates in a multi-agent\nmode, with the LLM acting as an independent advisor. However,\nwhen human operators review and implement suggestions, the\ninteraction temporarily shifts to a Centaurian mode, creating a\ntightly integrated human-AI decision unit. For example, in path\nplanning, the LLM can suggest changes to curve parameters based\non detected obstacles or changes in terrain, maintaining its agent\nindependence, while human operators review these suggestions\nthrough a Centaurian-style deep integration process.\n/five.tnum./four.tnum Human-agent collaboration\nThe collaboration model in this system demonstrates the value\nof supporting both paradigms. While the overall architecture\nfollows multi-agent principles, with human operators functioning\nas independent agents within the system, their interaction with the\nLLM and control systems often exhibits Centaurian characteristics.\nThis ﬂexible approach allows the system to leverage both the\nindependence and coordination capabilities of the multi-agent\nFrontiers in Human Dynamics /one.tnum/zero.tnum frontiersin.org\nBorghoﬀ et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fhumd./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum./one.tnum/five.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/six.tnum\nFIGURE /nine.tnum\nInformation and decision ﬂows in the semi-centralized control str ategy.\nparadigm and the deep integration beneﬁts of the Centaurian\napproach.

This integration enables the execution of complex\ntasks across multiple applications with high accuracy and\nminimal latency.\nFor example, consider a LAM processing an ambiguous user\ncommand such as “Schedule a meeting with the team soon.”\nThe LLM (stochastic) might probabilistically interpret “soon”\nas “within 2 days” based on training data, while the symbolic\nscheduler (deterministic) enforces a rule that “soon” must map\nto a ﬁxed 24-h window. To resolve this, the observation space\n(see\nFigure 5) mediates between the two layers: the LLM’s proposal\nis marked as a “suggestion” token, which triggers a human-\nAI negotiation protocol in the computational space. Here, the\nsystem either accepts the LLM’s output with a conﬁdence threshold\n(> 80%) or defaults to the symbolic rule, logging the conﬂict\nfor later reﬁnement.

Basic interaction\nprotocols have been formalized for distributed computation\n(\nAspnes and Ruppert, 2009 ), while more complex patterns have\nbeen developed for knowledge combination ( Andreoli et al., 1994 ;\nBorghoﬀ and Schlichter, 1996 ) and distributed problem-solving\n(Borghoﬀ et al., 1998 ). Recent work has focused on higher-level\ninteractions, particularly in intention recognition ( de Greef et al.,\n2007; Inga et al., 2023 ), which is becoming increasingly important\nas artiﬁcial agents grow more sophisticated in their ability to\nunderstand and respond to human goals.\nGuamán et al. (2021) presents an innovative unsupervised\nclustering theory using self-organizing maps to classify MVC\npatterns based on software quality metrics in a continuous\ninteraction process. Their goal is to identify quality features that\ndetermine the similarity of MVC applications without architectural\nbias.\nLawless and Sofge (2021) use interdependence theory to\ndetermine whether convergence has a positive or negative eﬀect\nin a competition between human and artiﬁcial agents, as in system\ndynamics models.\nMobile applications, as well as satellite and swarm robotics,\nhave grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, with architectural\npatterns playing a critical role in their success. To ensure\nthe correct implementation of an MVC pattern,\nDobrean and\nDiosan (2022) propose an automated technique that analyzes and\ndetects architectural issues using data from Software Development\nKits (SDKs) speciﬁcally targeted at mobile code bases. To\nenhance coordination and security in swarm robotic systems,\nCarovilla et al. (2023) introduce a semi-centralized framework\nthat integrates blockchain technology, featuring a centralized\ncontrol unit that coordinates the swarm, while blockchain\ntechnology ensures secure and decentralized data storage and\ncommunication.\nKumar and Choppella (2023) take the opposite\napproach, extending pattern descriptions with a System of\nSystems (SoS) model to apply interactive dynamics to an\nMVC pattern.\nUsing the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm as a complex\ndistributed system that shares a 3-tier architecture consisting of\nembedded nodes, gateways that connect an embedded network\nto the wider internet, and data services in servers or the\ncloud,\nRiliskis et al. (2015) propose a novel approach for\nprogramming applications across 3-tiers using a distributed\nextension of the MVC architecture. Also in the IoT context,\nwith a focus on the gaming/sports arena,\nChen (2025) sees\npotential for entertainment robots to recognize human posture\nthrough artiﬁcial intelligence. By detecting and monitoring users’\nmovements in real time, these robots provide a personalized\nand interactive entertainment experience.\nCaci and Dhou (2020)\nalso discuss the interplay between games with personality and\nartiﬁcial intelligence. They use the term “virtual human” to\ndescribe a computer program that simulates a human in\nsome aspects.\nWith the ubiquity of AI applications, HCI research is\nincreasingly integrating these approaches, demonstrating that AI\nand HCI are mutually beneﬁcial when they collaborate (\nPanda\nand Roy, 2024 ). However, criticism and bad experiences have also\nbeen reported. For example, Choudhuri et al. (2024) state that\nthere were no statistical diﬀerences in participants’ productivity\nor self-eﬃcacy when using ChatGPT compared to traditional\nresources. Instead, they found signiﬁcantly higher frustration\nlevels, identifying ﬁve distinct errors resulting from violations of\nhuman-AI interaction guidelines, leading to various (negative)\nconsequences for the participants.\nLLMs are increasingly being used in studies to investigate the\ninteraction between humans and artiﬁcial agents.\nBorghoﬀ et al.\n(2024b) explore human-artiﬁcial interaction with generative AIs\nin a software engineering project course. In the same domain,\nNascimento et al. (2023) evaluates ChatGPT-generated code against\ndeveloper-generated code to determine which tasks are better\nsuited for engineers and which are better handled by AI. This\ncould lead to more eﬃcient interaction (e.g., AI as a tutor for SE\ndevelopers) and provide new insights into innovative AI strategies\nthat include the involvement of humans-in-the-loop to support\nthe tasks of software engineering.\nCapitanelli and Mastrogiovanni\n(2024) demonstrate that LLMs can play an important role in\nplanning actions in human-robot interactions.\nGiudici et al. (2024) present and evaluate a method\nfor analyzing user reactions to AI using a live-streaming\nplatform where human streamers conduct interviews that\nare transmitted to a specially developed GPT voice interface\nusing a crowd-based approach.\nKim and Im (2023) study the\nattribution of human characteristics to artiﬁcial intelligence. They\ndeveloped a tool to measure how users form anthropomorphic\nreactions to interactions with AI chatbots in a banking service\nsetting. For a survey of Artiﬁcial Emotional Intelligence\n(AEI) for cooperative social human-machine interactions see\nAhmadi and Hammond (2023) .\nMessage Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) ( Papillon et al.,\n2023) are a special class of neural networks that use the\naforementioned message-passing paradigm to capture interactions\nbetween entities (often represented as nodes in a graph). In\nMPNNs, nodes in a graph communicate with their neighbors\nthrough a series of message-passing steps. This interaction allows\nthe network to learn representations by aggregating information\nfrom neighboring nodes; see also the R ABBIT use case in Section 6.\nA formal model of the global activity of a system of agents\nis provided by concurrent game structures , describing a situation\nwhere agents act according to individual strategies by which to\nselect individual actions based on knowledge of the global state\nof the system. Reasoning on the possible evolutions of such\nsystems leads to the deﬁnition of some variations of Alternating-\nTime Temporal Logic (see e.g.,\nAlur et al., 2002 ; Alechina\net al., 2017 ; Mogavero et al., 2017 ).

By articulating HCI not just as human-computer\ninteractions but as dynamic interactions among diﬀerent agents\nwithin a ﬂexible, multi-agent system, we have highlighted\nthe potential for more complex and eﬀective interactions.\nThe application of our multi-agent model to two diﬀerent\nuse cases—satellite and swarm robotics, and Large Action\nModels (LAMs)—has not only validated our theoretical\nconstructs, but also underscored the practical implications of\nsuch interactions.\nIn the ﬁrst use case, we observed how a semi-centralized\nsystem, enabled by a large language model, could improve decision-\nmaking processes and adaptability through real-time data-driven\nadjustments. This setup not only ensures eﬃciency, but also\npreserves human oversight, which is critical for managing complex,\ndynamic environments.\nThe second use case involving LAMs further highlighted\nthe potential of integrating advanced computational agents to\npredict and shape human-computer interactions. Using neuro-\nsymbolic programming, the LAM framework demonstrated its\nability to reﬁne its operations based on continuous feedback\nfrom human interactions, promoting an adaptive and responsive\nHCI system.\nWe have thus established a foundational framework for\nthe design and analysis of HCI systems that views these\ninteractions as a complex interplay among multiple agents.\nThis approach allows us to better understand and harness the\ncollective capabilities of diﬀerent agents, thereby enhancing\nthe system’s adaptability and resilience. Importantly, this\nperspective aligns with emerging technology paradigms that\nfoster a deep understanding and integration of human agents.\nIndeed, our contribution can be seen as a systemic evolution\nin design approaches, emphasizing the front-end to enhance\nusability and eﬀectiveness. This contrasts with, but complements,\nsystemic approaches that prioritize the back-end for security and\nrobustness, as illustrated by\nSalzano et al. (2023) . Together, these\nperspectives synergistically improve the overall architecture of\nHCI systems.\nThe integration of human and artiﬁcial agents also raises critical\nethical and regulatory considerations. Our framework’s layered\ncommunication spaces–surface, observation, and computation–\nprovide inherent auditability through explicit transition logs and\ntoken-based interaction traces, aligning with AI accountability\nguidelines (\nFloridi, 2019 ; EU, 2024 ). For high-stakes domains\nsuch as healthcare or defense, this enables clear attribution of\ndecisions to human or AI agents, while preserving the ﬂuidity of\nCentaurian collaboration. Future work will further formalize these\nmechanisms to ensure compliance with emerging standards for\nhybrid intelligence systems.\nUltimately, our study enriches the understanding of HCI\nas a dynamic and evolving ﬁeld characterized by the complex\nyet symbiotic relationships between humans and machines.\nAs we delve deeper into these interactions, the possibility of\ntransforming human-computer interactions into more seamless\nand eﬀective experiences becomes increasingly tangible. This\npromises a future in which the human and artiﬁcial dimensions\nare not merely aligned but fully integrated in a balanced\nand complementary manner. Such integration could pave the\nway for a new era of collective and hybrid intelligence—\nwhere humans and machines work closely together—potentially\nthe most signiﬁcant and immediate outcome of current rapid\ntechnological advances.\nFuture research will focus on improving the adaptability of\nMAS by addressing the challenge of dynamic team composition.\nStandard Petri nets, with their static structure, have diﬃculty\naccommodating scenarios where agents join or leave while\nmaintaining consensus, as illustrated by the register and\nderegister (for active agents) pseudo-code in Section 4.\nTherefore, we plan to model agents as individual (colored) Petri\nnets with specialized input and output locations, allowing token-\nbased message passing for seamless registration and deregistration.\nHowever, smooth coordination requires high-level reconﬁguration\nmechanisms to dynamically manage agent lifecycles. While these\nimprovements enhance the adaptability of MAS, Centaurian\nsystems, with their stable human-AI integration, remain well-\nsuited to Petri net formalization due to their reliance on ﬁxed\ncoordination structures.\nAnother important future research direction is the\ndevelopment of a hybrid approach that bridges MAS and\nCentaurian systems. While Petri nets eﬀectively model structured\nCentaurian intelligence, where human and AI components\ncollaborate through predeﬁned coordination rules, they fall short\nin dynamic MAS scenarios that require self-organization. Future\nresearch will therefore integrate high-level reconﬁgurable networks\nto enable agent ﬂuidity, while using communication spaces as an\nintermediate layer for seamless coordination between autonomous\nand tightly coupled agents. This three-tiered approach will enable\ndynamic transitions between structured Centaurian intelligence\nand decentralized MAS interactions. Given the increasing\nimportance of Centaurian AI in human-computer collaboration,\nthis hybrid framework will improve eﬃciency, adaptability,\nand interoperability.\nAn alternative set-theoretic approach abstracts agent\nrelationships without rigid network structures, deﬁning\ninteractions through set membership and relational mappings.\nWhile this circumvents the limitations of Petri nets in dynamic\nscenarios, its implementation requires structured protocols\nfor message ﬂow and consistency. Our future research will\ntherefore explore how set-theoretic models can complement Petri\nFrontiers in Human Dynamics /one.tnum/four.tnum frontiersin.org\nBorghoﬀ et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fhumd./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum./one.tnum/five.tnum/seven.tnum/nine.tnum/one.tnum/six.tnum/six.tnum\nnets to ensure both formal rigor and practical applicability in\nhuman-AI collaboration.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included\nin the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be\ndirected to the corresponding author.\nAuthor contributions\nUB: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis,\nInvestigation, Methodology, Software, Supervision, Validation,\nVisualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review &\nediting.
