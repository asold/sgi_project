  "abstract": "In the digital era of increasing software complexity, improving the development efficiency of safety-critical software is a challenging task faced by academia and industry in domains such as nuclear energy, aviation, the automotive industry, and rail transportation. Recently, people have been excited about using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 to generate code. Professionals in the safety-critical software field are intrigued by the code generation capabilities of LLMs. However, there is currently a lack of systematic case studies in this area. Aiming at the need for automated code generation in safety-critical domains such as nuclear energy and the automotive industry, this paper conducts a case study on generating safety-critical software code using GPT-4 as the tool. Practical engineering cases from the industrial domain are employed. We explore different approaches, including code generation based on overall requirements, specific requirements, and augmented prompts. We propose a novel prompt engineering method called Prompt-FDC that integrates basic functional requirements, domain feature generalization, and domain constraints. This method improves code completeness from achieving 30% functions to 100% functions, increases the code comment rate to 26.3%, and yields better results in terms of code compliance, readability, and maintainability. The code generation approach based on LLMs also introduces a new software development process and V-model lifecycle for safety-critical software. Through systematic case studies, we demonstrate that, with appropriate prompt methods, LLMs can auto-generate safety-critical software code that meets practical engineering application requirements. It is foreseeable that LLMs can be applied to various engineering domains to improve software safety and development efficiency.",
