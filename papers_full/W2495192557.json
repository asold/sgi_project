Introduction \nPower transformer is one of the most expensive and \nimportant static device in a power system network. Any \nfailure of this device will lead to serious consequential \nlosses. This costly electrical device has to function for long \nperiods without any problem.  Condition monitoring for \npreventive maintenance of these equipments is important and \nessential to have reliable and uninterrupted power supply [1]. \nCondition assessment and condition monitoring of power \ntransformer can be done by monitoring the various properties \nof transformer oil [2-5]. Optical sensor based instrumentation \nsystem can be used as diagnostic t ool in predictive, \npreventive and corrective maintenance of transformer. This \nenables utility engineers to have in -depth understanding of \ntransformer oil as a part of condition monitoring of \ntransformer. \n \n2. General concept and need of condition \nmonitoring \nCondition monitoring means the continuous evaluation of the \nhealth of equipments throughout its serviceable life. It is the \ncontinuous study of the operating parameters of any device \nso that changes of any monitored parameters can be used to \nforecast the nee d for maintenance before breakdown or \nunwanted situation occurs. It can also be used to estimate the \nlife-span of the machine. Though condition monitoring can \nbe extended to provide primary protection, but its real \nfunction must always be to attempt to rec ognize the \ndevelopment of faults at an early stage. Such advanced \nwarning is obviously desirable since it allows maintenance \nstaff greater freedom to schedule outage in the most \nconvenient manner, resulting in lower down time and lower \ncapitalized losses. Transformer condition monitoring can be \ndivided into following six main categories. \n Condition monitoring by thermal analysis \n Condition monitoring by winding vibration analysis \n Condition monitoring by dissolve gas analysis \n Condition monitoring by winding movement and \ndeformation \n Condition monitoring by partial discharge analysis \n(PD) \n Condition monitoring by on load tap changer \n \n3. Optical fiber basics \nOptical fiber have mainly three parts; core, cladding and \njacket. Core and cladding generally made of glass o r plastic. \nJacket is a layer of material used to protect the fiber from \nphysical damage. Cores have the refractive index more than \nthat of cladding. Light propagates mainly through the core \nfollowing the light guiding principle ―total internal \nreflection‖. The structure of an optical fiber is shown in \nfig.1. \n \n \nFigure1: Structure of optical fiber. \n \n \nOptical fibers are classified mainly in to two groups called \nsingle mode and multimode. Multimode fiber again \nclassified based on the refraction profile in to two groups; \nstep index fiber and graded index fiber. Step index fibers \nhave a constant index profile over the whole cross section \nand graded index fibers have a nonlinear but rotationally \nsymmetric index profile falls from center to outwards.  The \nrefractive index profiles of single mode and multimode fibers \nare shown in fig.2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nADBU-Journal of Engineering Technology \n \n 143 AJET, ISSN: 2348-7305, Volume 4(1), 2016 \n \n4. Fiber-Optic sensor based instrumentation \nsystem \nFigure2: The refractive index profiles of fibers \n \nGenerally, a fiber -optic sensor system consists of an optical \nsource (laser, LED, laser diode, etc.), optical fiber, sensing or \nmodulator element transducing the measurand to an optical \nsignal, an optical detector and processing electronics (optical \nspectrum analyzer, oscilloscope, etc.) [6]. Schematic of \noptical sensor bas ed instrumentation system is shown in \nfig.3. \n \n5. Fiber-Optic Sensor Classifications \nFiber-optic sensors are categorized in to two groups referred \nto intrinsic and extrinsic sensors. The intrinsic fiber -optic \nsensor has a sensing region within the fiber and li ght never \ngoes out of the fiber. In extrinsic sensors, light leaves the \nfiber and reach the sensing region outside, and then comes \nback to the fiber [7]. Fiber -optic sensors can also be \nclassified under three categories [6]: the sensing location, the \noperating principle and the application, as shown in Table 1. \n \nFigure3: Basic components of the system \n \n6. Advantages of fiber-optic sensors \nFiber optic sensor technology has drawn attentions \nworldwide because of its indispensable application in almost \nall indust ries [1 -23]. The optical fiber sensors provide off \nline and online measurements of various parameters like \ntemperature, pressure, vibration, strain, current, pH, rotation, \ntoxic gas, humidity liquid level, liquid flow and many others \nthat are based on the different sensing principles [1-8]. \nOptical fiber sensors have several advantages over \nconventional sensors which includes light weight, high \nsensitivity, simple structure, compact size, less signal loss, \nlow cost, high stability and longevity, high corrosive \nresistance, high repeatability, immunity to electromagnetic \n \n \n \nTABLE 1: FIBER-OPTIC SENSOR CLASSIFICATIONS \n \ninterference, low power consumption, easy multiplexing and \nintegration with other conditioning units [1 - 23]. These types \nof sensors are also well suited for real time monitoring of \ntransformer oil level [2, 3], where electromagnetic induction \nresistance and electrical isolation are strictly required. \n \n7. Transformer oil analysis  \nCondition monitoring is a part of predictive maintenance. It \nallows maintenance to be scheduled; helps to predict the \npossible time of failure measuring the deterioration level and \nfind out the action to be taken to avoid the consequences of \nmajor failure. The monitoring technique may be either onlin e \nor offline depending on the type of the used technique.  In \nthe last twenty years different methods and tools have been \ndeveloped and many papers have been published for \ncondition monitoring of power transformers. The complexity \nin design, construction, operation and environment factors on \npower transformer have made the proper condition \nassessment process very difficult. It has been found from the \nliterature that the health of power transformer and its lifespan \nduring the service period mainly depends on  the insulation \nlevel of the transformer oil. The mineral insulating oil in the \ntransformer gives dielectric strength, efficient cooling, \nprotect the transformer core and coil assembly from chemical \nattack and prevent the buildup of sludge in the \ntransformer[8]. When the properties of the oil have changed \nenough that the oil can no longer satisfactorily perform any \nof these functions, the oil is said to be bad oil and \nsignificantly reduces the transformer‘s life expectancy. The \nlimits of transformer oil pro perties as per BIS 335 -1993 is \ngiven in Table2. While the transformer oil in operation, \ntransformer oil is subjected to electrical, thermal and \nmechanical stresses [9, 10]. In addition there are \ncontaminations caused due to chemical interactions with \nwindings and other materials of solid insulation, catalyzed by \nhigh temperature. As a result, the original properties of the \ntransformer oil changes gradually, rendering it ineffective for \nits intended purpose after many years. Hence this oil is \nperiodically te sted to ascertain its basic properties, and to \nmake sure it is suitable for further use or any action has to be \ndone. The tests which are considered sufficient to ascertain \nthe quality of oil before acceptance and to determine whether \nthe condition of the oil is adequate for continued use in the \ntransformer and to suggest the type of corrective action \nneeded, if required, are as given  in table 3. \n8.

In paper [11] three common \nprinciples; fiber Bragg gratings, Raman scattering and \ninterferometric point sensors are exemplarily examined for \ntemperature measurement using fiber optic sensor.  \nTABLE 3: TEST OF TRANSFORMER OIL \nPhysical test Chemical test Electrical Test \nAppearance Neutralizations \nnumber \nElectric strength \nDensity Water content Dielectric \nDissipation Fact. \nViscosity Sediment & sludge Resistivity \nPour point Corrosive Sulphur  \nFlash point Oxidation stability  \nInterfacial \ntension \nInhibit content  \nTheir working principles along with recent findings and \napplications of the sensing concepts are also presented. In \npaper [12], basic investigations of the partial discharge \nbehaviour of a test arrangement with implementation of fiber \noptic cables is presented. In this work transformer board or \nplastics under air or oil test setup is examined with different \ntypes of fiber optical sensor. A fiber optic sensor based \ninstrumentation system is used in paper [13] to monitor the \nmoisture level in transformer oil where a bare bent \nmultimode fiber is used as optical sensor. The author \ndescribes about the change of output light intensity due to the \nchange of refractive index proximity to the sensor. Paper \n[14] proposes the combine use of optical and gas sensing \ntechnology for the testing of transformer oil where optical \nsensor provides the absorption properties of transformer o il. \nIn paper [15] use of interfeerometric intrinsic sensor is \nexplain to measure the vibration of magnetic cores of power \ntransformer. Apart from vibration, thermal magnitude of the \ntransformer is also discussed in the same paper. In papers \n[16, 17], inter ferometric fiber optic sensors with intrinsic \ntransducer is used to measure ultrasound of acoustic \nemission from partial discharge inside power apparatus. \nIntensity based partial discharge measurement using optical \nsensor has also been discussed in paper [ 18]. In paper [19, \n20], transformer oil condition has been analyzed studying the \nchange of light at output due to absorptive of gases by \noptical sensor. An approach to power transformer asset \nmanagement using health index and based on condition \nmonitoring and standard diagnosis has been discussed in \npapers [21-23]. All these literature has been given as tabular \nform in table 4. \nTABLE 4: LITERATURE IN TABULAR FORM \nMonitoring parameter Principle used Reference \nTransformer oil level  Intensity based on \nevanescent effect \n[2], [3] \nTemperature  Phase modulation [4] \nHot-spot temperature Intensity based [10] \nTemperature fiber Bragg \ngratings, Raman \nscattering \n[11] \nPartial Discharge Raman scattering, \nRayleigh,  \n[12] \nMoisture Intensity based [13] \nGas Intensity [14] \nVibration Phase, intensity [15] \nPartial discharge Phase change [16, 17] \nPartial discharge Intensity based [18,19] \n9. Conclusion \nOptical sensor basics, different principles and their \napplications for transformer condition monitoring have been \nreviewed extensively. It is found from the literature that \noptical fiber sensing technology and the instrumentation \nsystem is an ideal tool to  measure various parameters of \ntransformer oil to estimate the health condition of different \ntransformer. Recent research clearly shows that optical \nsensors are the most sensitive, light, reliable and cost \neffective sensors for condition monitoring of transformers.  \nReferences \n[1] Y. Han and Y.
