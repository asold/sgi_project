  "abstract": "Generative-AI (GAI) models like ChatGPT are becoming widely discussed and utilized tools in medical education. For example, it can be used to assist with studying for exams, shown capable of passing the USMLE board exams. However, there have been concerns expressed regarding its fair and ethical use. We designed an electronic survey for students across North American medical colleges to gauge their views on and current use of ChatGPT and similar technologies in May, 2023. Overall, 415 students from at least 28 medical schools completed the questionnaire and 96% of respondents had heard of ChatGPT and 52% had used it for medical school coursework. The most common use in pre-clerkship and clerkship phase was asking for explanations of medical concepts and assisting with diagnosis/treatment plans, respectively. The most common use in academic research was for proof reading and grammar edits. Respondents recognized the potential limitations of ChatGPT, including inaccurate responses, patient privacy, and plagiarism. Students recognized the importance of regulations to ensure proper use of this novel technology. Understanding the views of students is essential to crafting workable instructional courses, guidelines, and regulations that ensure the safe, productive use of generative-AI in medical school.",
