Introduction \nThe productivity of machine tools can be significantly improved by using \nmicrocomputer based CAD/CAM systems for NC program generation. Currently, a number \nof commercial CAD/CAM packages that provide automatic NC programming have been \ndeveloped and applied to various cutting proce sses. To cut any process using CNC machine \ntools, a tool path for the cutting tool should be determined. The total production time to cut \nany part using CNC machine tools consists of travel time (the time to move the CNC \nmachine spindle between operations), switch time (the time to change the cutting tool for \nnext operation), and the cutting time (the time that the cutting tool moves with cutting speed \nin air or in material). A survey of the litera ture shows that much research has been done on \nminimizing the cutting time\n(1), (2); however, there is a lack of lite rature that studies the travel \ntime between the operations. In order to minimize the travel time, the cutting tool travel \npath (CTTP) between operations should be minimized. CTTP can be classified into two \ntypes, one is continuous travel path. In this type the start point and the end point of each \noperation are the same\n(3), and it mainly appears in hole-cutting operations such as drilling, \nreaming, and tapping. The other is the discontinuous travel path, where the start and end \npoints of the operation are different. This ty pe includes most other operations such as \ngrooving, pocketing, etc. Kolahan et al.\n(4) used a tabu-search appro ach to minimize the total \nprocessing cost for hole-making operations. They considered tool travel time, tool switching \ntime and the cutting time and used the tabu-search algorithm to find the solution. They \nstudied the holes that have the same surfaces level, which means the cutting tool, travels in \nxy plane to move from one hole to another. We have previously proposed optimization \n*Received 4 Dec., 2006 (No. 06-0241) \n[DOI: 10.1299/jamdsm.1.272] \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 1, No. 2, 2007 \n273 \nmethod for hole-cutting operations sequence in CNC machine tools using genetic algorithm \n(GA) (3) . In this previous study, the operations contained a similar holes located in different \nlevels. In contrast, our study solves CTTP for a different operation processes that can be \ndone by using single cutting tool.  \nCTTP can be formulated as a special case of  the traveling salesman problem (TSP) but \nis more complicated since the operations start and end points are different also are located \nin different planes and the cutting tool uses a save path to travel between such points. In this \npaper, we attempt to find an efficient soluti on approach to determine the best sequence of \noperations for the different process that achieve s the shortest CTTP. In order to do this, GA \nis used to find the shortest CTTP. The G-c odes needed for this ope ration are then created. \nBefore going through the optimization of CTTP and the G-code generation, the basic \nconcepts of the NC program configuration are explained in the following section. \n2. CNC Program Configuration \nFor any operation using CNC machine tools, NC program is needed. There are two NC \nprogram types. One type can be coded by a programmer which is suitable for simple cutting \nprocess. The other type is generated by one of the commercial CAD/CAM packages that provide \nautomatic NC programming, and this type is suitable for complex shape that cannot be \nprogrammed easily. NC program is a series of coded instructions required to produce a part. It \ncontrols the movement of the machine tool and the on/off control of auxiliary functions such as \nspindle rotation and coolant. The coded instructions are composed of letters, numbers and \nsymbols and are arranged in a format of functional blocks. Each block consists of one or more \nNC words. An NC word is a collection of characters that begins with an address followed by \nnumbers. A character is one byte (8 bits) of information representing a number, letter, or symbol. \nThe sequence and arrangement of NC words in part programs must follow a certain pattern that \nis called the tape format or program. For any program, various functions and their related \ncommanding methods are required. There are two main functions: (1) first function is a \npreparatory function which is designated in a program by the word address G, and (2) \nMiscellaneous functions which use the address letter M\n(5), An example of whole program can be \nshown in Fig. 1 (6), the most important part of the program is a machining program parts which \ncontain the G-codes needed to complete specific operation process.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nO______; Program name. \nN______; Sequence number. \nG90 G17 G40 G80 G49; Initial conditions. \nT01; \nM06; \nN_____; \nT_____; \nG90 G54 G00 X___ Y___; Coordinate system  \nG43Z___H___M03; Tool length correction. \nZ___ M08; \n \nG01 Z___F___; \nX___Y___F___;  .   .   .  . \n . \nG00 Z___M09; \nG91 G28 Z0 M08; Return to origin \nG90 X___Y___; \nM06; \nM30; End of program. \nProgram for the next process \nFig.1  Example of NC program \nRegistration of main spindle tool \nMachining program \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 1, No. 2, 2007 \n274 \n3. Problem Description and Formulation  \nWith the hand programing and the CAD/CAM packages that provide automatic NC \nprogramming, NC program does not use optimal techniques to find CTTP. The traditional \nprocesses to produce any products using CNC machines are: draw a product → find the tool path \n→ create the NC program. Using this pattern the shortest CTTP couldn’t be considered. It may \ntake long machining time to complete the operations. In order to overcome this kind of \ndisadvantage, we introduce GA. GA can efficiently find the sequence of operations that achieves \nthe shortest CTTP. The cutting tool should travel through the safe CTTP to avoid damaging the \nworkpiece and the cutting tool. In order to achieve the safe CTTP, the cutting tool must pass \nthrough an imaginary point when it moves between two operations in different planes. \nThe CTTP can be formulated as a special case of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). \nCities in our problem are represented by operations and the salesman is represented by cutting \ntool. Similar to the TSP, CTTP consists of a number of nodes, with the distances between them \ngiven. The goal is to find the minimum length tour that visits each node exactly once. There are \nthree main differences between CTTP and the conventional TSP. The first difference is that the \narrival and departure points are assumed to be the same point in conventional TSP where the two \npoints are different in CTTP, as shown in Fig. 2. The second difference is that the salesman in \nthe TSP is returning to the starting city, where the tool in CTTP completes its tour when it \nreaches the last operation. The third difference is that the travel between the nodes in CTTP has \nsome constraints to avoid any touch between the cutting tool and the workpiece. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4. Review of the TSP and its Variants \n4.1 Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) \nTSP is one of the most widely studied combinatorial optimization problems (7), (8), (9). The most \ncommon practical interpretation of the TSP is that of a salesman seeking the shortest tour \nthrough N cities, visiting each city exactly once and returning back to the starting city. The \nproblem statement is deceptively simple, but it still remains as one of the most challenging \nproblems in operational research. To solve such problems of any size is by enumerating each \npossible tour and searching for the tour with the shortest path. Each possible tour is a \npermutation of 1, 2, 3,  . . ., N . where N is the number of cities, so the number of tours is n!. \nWhen n is large, it becomes impossible to find the path of every tour in polynomial time.  \nThe TSP can be described mathematically as follows. Consider a complete digraph G = (V,P) \nwhere V is the vertex set that represents the cities, V = { 1,…,N } , A is the arc \nset,\n(){} Vj,i,j,i  A ∈=  and Dij  is the distance between cities i and j. The TSP then can be \nsolved by minimizing the total trip given by Eq. (1) below. \n Fig. 2  Conventional TSP path and CTTP \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 1, No. 2, 2007 \n275 \n \n                 M i n i m i z e   \n()\nij\nAj,i\nijD λ∑\n∈\n s u b j e c t e d  t o :                      ( 1 )  \n{ }1,0ij ∈λ  \n                          1\nVi\nij =∑\n∈\nλ   Vj ∈                          ( 2 - A )  \n                          1\nVj\nij =∑\n∈\nλ    Vi ∈                          ( 2 - B )  \n \nConstraints 2-A and 2-B ensure that each city is visited exactly once. The TSP is an \nNP-complete problem (10), heuristic algorithms that have relatively short running times and often \ngive solutions that differ only slightly from the optimal solution. Several methods, usually based \non search heuristics, have been applied for the traveling salesman problem, such as Greedy \nAlgorithms\n(11), The Nearest Neighbor algorithm (12), A minimum spanning tree (11), (12), simulated \nannealing(13), tabu search (14), neural networks (15). One of the methods for solving the TSP is \ngenetic algorithms (GA) (16). GA is global optimization techniques using various optimization \nproblems, such as the TSP(17). \n4.2 Distances Between CTTP Nodes \nTo find the CTTP, the importance is how to find the distance between two pair of \noperations in the CTTP. Calculating the distance between two nodes depends on the plane where \nthe two nodes belong to. Also depend on the start and end points of the operation. The distance D \nbetween a pair of operations through the CTTP can be calculated as follows: \nCASE 1: If the two nodes belong to the same plane,\n \nThen D can be calculated using Eq. (3). \n                   2\nji\n2\nji\n2\nji )z-(z)y-(y)x-(x D ++=                  ( 3 )  \nCASE 2:  If the two nodes belong to different planes, as shown in Fig. 3, Then  D  can be \ncalculated as follows. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRefer to Fig. 3 and consider the points \n( )iiii z,y,xP  and ( )jjjj z,y,xP  which are located in \nplane A and plane B respectively.

GA differ \nfrom other search techniques which depend on natural genetic evaluation process, start with an \ninitial set of solutions selected randomly called population and follow the biological evolution \nprocess to improve upon them. The solution set in the population, called as chromosome or \nindividual, represents a solution to the optimization problem. Each individual contains a number \nof genes. The individuals in the initial population are evaluated to measure its  fitness. Based on \nthe individuals’ fitness, some individuals are selected from the current population as parents. GA \noperations like crossover and mutation are then applied to the parents to generate new \nindividuals, called offspring’ s. These offspring’s are then evaluated. A new population can be \ngenerated by selecting some of the parents and offspring’s. The iteration, called a generation will \ncontinue until the fitness reaches its maximum value. The best overall solution becomes the \ncandidate solution to the problem. Similar cutting operations (holes) are considered in the GA \noperations. The operations for our GA are described in \n§§ 5.1 ~ 5.4. \n5.1 Encoding \nThe CTTP, same as the TSP, is a sequential problem so we need to make some changes to \nthe traditional genetic algorithm to solve this type of problem. To encode CTTP we use a path \nrepresentation where the hole centers are listed in the order in which they are visited.  \nFor example, assuming there are 4 holes A, B, C, D, if a cutting tool starts from the center \nof hole B, through hole centers C, D, A, the individual will be B C D A. For N holes, we \ninitialize the population by randomly placing 1 to N into N length individual and guaranteeing \nthat each hole center appears exactly once. Then the individual for N holes can be coded as \nshown in Eq. (15). \n                         \n]G  G   G [G  individual Ni21 \"\"= ,             ( 1 5 )  \n                 N,2,1 i G ]G  G   G [G G iNi21i \"\"\"∩ =∀=  \n5.2 Crossover \nThe traditional crossover operation is not suitable for this type of representation because \neach gene should appear exactly once in each individual. There are several crossover operators \nfor TSPs. We use Greedy Crossover which was invented by Grefenstette \n(18). Greedy crossover \nselects the first hole center of one parent, compares the hole centers leaving that hole in both \nparents, and chooses the closer one to extend the tour. If one hole has already appeared in the \ntour, we choose the other city. If both holes have already appeared, we randomly select a \nnon-selected hole. For example, consider the two parents as shown in Fig. 4.  If the first \nindividual is chosen as the template, child 1 can be generated using the following steps: \nStep 1: Select hole 5 (the first hole in the iduvidual) as the first city of child 1.  \nStep 2: Find the edges after gene 5 in both parents: (5, 2) and (5, 6) and compare the distance of \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 1, No. 2, 2007 \n278 \nthese two edges. The hole located in the shorter distance will be chosen as the second gene, \nassuming the distance between hole 5 and hole 2 is shorter, we select hole 2 as the next gene of \nchild 1.  \nStep 3: Find the edges after hole 2: (2, 4) and (2, 3). If the distance between hole 2 and hole 3 is \nshorter, we select hole 3 as the next gene.  \nStep 4: Find the edges after hole 3: (3, 1) and (3, 4). If the distance between hole 3 and hole 1 is \nshorter, we select hole 1 as the next gene.  \nStep 5: Find the edges after city 1: (1, 6) and (1, 2), since hole 2 appears in child 2, we select \nhole 6 as the next gene. \nStep 6: Find the edges after city 6: (6, 5) and (6, 1), but hole 5 and hole 1 both appear in child 1. \nWe select a non-selected hole, which is hole 4, and thus produce a legal child. We can use the \nsame procedure to generate child 2 as shown in Fig. 4. After crossover, both offspring encode \nlegal tours.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5.3 Mutation \nFor the same reason that we do not use the traditional crossover operator, we can not use \nthe traditional mutation operator. Instead of using the traditional mutation operator, we randomly \nselect two genes in one individual and swap their values.

Algorithms Performance  \nThe improvement of the solution was measured with respect to an initial random solution. \nFor 84 population size problem, the algorithm resulting in 240% improved over an initial \nrandom solution. Fig. 6 shows the percentage improvements for problem with population size \nachieved by the algorithm. The improvement in solution is increased by increasing the number \nof holes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.

Conclusions \nThis paper finds the efficient sequence of operations located in asymmetrical locations and \ndifferent levels that achieves the shortest CTTP. The cutting tool travel path was formulated as a \nspecial case of the TSP with some constraints. The main constraint is forcing the cutting tool to \nvisit an imaginary point to avoid any touch with the workpiece. The incorporation of GA and \nTSP introduced in this paper is used to find the sequence of operation. This incorporation of GA \nand TSP is not restricted to machining but can be applied to any similar problem such as spot \nwelding sequence. The percentage improvements from the initial to the final generation depend \non the problem size. As the number of holes increases, the improvement is increased. The \nincorporation of GA and TSP can be included in the commercial CAD/CAM packages to \noptimize the CTTP during automatic generation of CNC machine programs \n \nReferences \n(1) Castelino, K., D'Souza, R. and Wright, P.
