    "abstract": "Abstract Reservoir dispatching regulations are a crucial basis for reservoir operation, and using information extraction technology to extract entities and relationships from heterogeneous texts to form triples can provide structured knowledge support for professionals in making dispatch decisions and intelligent recommendations. Current information extraction technologies require manual data labeling, consuming a significant amount of time. As the number of dispatch rules increases, this method cannot meet the need for timely generation of dispatch plans during emergency flood control periods. Furthermore, utilizing natural language prompts to guide large language models in completing reservoir dispatch extraction tasks also presents challenges of cognitive load and instability in model output. Therefore, this paper proposes an entity and relationship extraction method for reservoir dispatch based on structured prompt language. Initially, a variety of labels are refined according to the extraction tasks, then organized and defined using the Backus–Naur Form (BNF) to create a structured format, thus better guiding large language models in the extraction work. Moreover, an AI agent based on this method has been developed to facilitate operation by dispatch professionals, allowing for the quick acquisition of structured data. Experimental verification has shown that, in the task of extracting entities and relationships for reservoir dispatch, this AI agent not only effectively reduces cognitive burden and the impact of instability in model output but also demonstrates high extraction performance (with F1 scores for extracting entities and relationships both above 80%), offering a new solution approach for knowledge extraction tasks in other water resource fields.",
