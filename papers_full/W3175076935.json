Previous studies focus\non the implicit exploration of multimodal co-\nreference by implicitly attending to spatial\nimage features or object-level image features\nbut neglect the importance of locating the ob-\njects explicitly in the visual content, which\nis associated with entities in the textual con-\ntent. Therefore, in this paper we propose\na Multimodal Incremental Transformer with\nVisual Grounding, named MITVG, which con-\nsists of two key parts: visual grounding and\nmultimodal incremental transformer. Visual\ngrounding aims to explicitly locate related ob-\njects in the image guided by textual entities,\nwhich helps the model exclude the visual con-\ntent that does not need attention. On the ba-\nsis of visual grounding, the multimodal incre-\nmental transformer encodes the multi-turn dia-\nlogue history combined with visual scene step\nby step according to the order of the dialogue\nand then generates a contextually and visually\ncoherent response. Experimental results on\nthe VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed model, which\nachieves comparable performance.\n1 Introduction\nRecently, there is increasing interest in vision-\nlanguage tasks, such as image caption (Xu et al.,\n2015; Anderson et al., 2016, 2018; Cornia et al.,\n2020) and visual question answering (Ren et al.,\n2015a; Gao et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016; Ander-\nson et al., 2018). In the real world, our conver-\nsations (Chen et al., 2020b, 2019) usually have\nmultiple turns. As an extension of conventional\nsingle-turn visual question answering, Das et al.\n(2017) introduce a multi-turn visual question an-\nswering task named visual dialogue, which aims to\nQ1: how many people ? \nQ2: is anyone holding a frisbee ?\nQ3: is the coach on the right ?\nQ4: are they wearing matching \nuniforms ?\nCaption: there is a frisbee team with their \ncoach taking a team photo \nA1: 7 people\nA2: yes\nA3: yes, on the far right \nA4: all except the coach\nFigure 1: An example of visual dialogue. The color in\ntext background corresponds to the same color box in\nthe image, which indicates the same entity. Our model\nﬁrstly associates textual entities with objects explicitly\nand then gives contextually and visually coherent an-\nswers to contextual questions.\nexplore the ability of an AI agent to hold a mean-\ningful multi-turn dialogue with humans in natural\nlanguage about visual content.\nVisual dialogue (Agarwal et al., 2020; Wang\net al., 2020; Qi et al., 2020; Murahari et al., 2020)\nrequires agents to give a response on the basis of\nunderstanding both visual and textual content. One\nof the key challenges in visual dialogue is how to\nsolve multimodal co-reference (Das et al., 2017;\nKottur et al., 2018). Therefore, some fusion-based\nmodels (Das et al., 2017) are proposed to fuse spa-\ntial image features and textual features in order to\nobtain a joint representation. Then attention-based\nmodels (Lu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018; Kottur\net al., 2018) are proposed to dynamically attend to\nspatial image features in order to ﬁnd related visual\ncontent. Furthermore, models based on object-level\nimage features (Niu et al., 2019; Gan et al., 2019;\nChen et al., 2020a; Jiang et al., 2020a; Nguyen\n437\net al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020b) are proposed to ef-\nfectively leverage the visual content for multimodal\nco-reference. However, as implicit exploration of\nmultimodal co-reference, these methods implic-\nitly attend to spatial or object-level image features,\nwhich is trained with the whole model and is in-\nevitably distracted by unnecessary visual content.\nIntuitively, speciﬁc mapping of objects and textual\nentities can reduce the noise of attention. As shown\nin Figure 1, the related objects can help the agent\nto understand the entities (e.g., Q1: “people”, Q2:\n“frisbee”, Q3: “coach”) for the generation of correct\nanswers. Then when it answers the question Q4\n“are they wearing matching uniforms ?”, the agent\nhas already comprehended “people” and “coach”\nfrom the previous conversation. On this basis, it\ncan learn the entity “uniforms” with the correspond-\ning object in the image, and generate the answer\n“all except the coach”. To this end, we need to 1)\nexplicitly locate related objects guided by textual\nentities to exclude undesired visual content, and 2)\nincrementally model the multi-turn structure of the\ndialogue to develop a uniﬁed representation com-\nbining multi-turn utterances with the corresponding\nrelated objects. However, previous work overlooks\nthese two important aspects.\nIn this paper, we thus propose a novel and ef-\nfective Multimodal Incremental Transformer with\nVisual Grounding, named MITVG, which contains\ntwo key parts: visual grounding and multimodal\nincremental transformer. Visual grounding aims\nto establish speciﬁc mapping of objects and tex-\ntual entities by explicitly locating related objects\nin the image with the textual entities. By doing\nso, our model can exclude undesired visual content\nand reduce attention noise. On the basis of visual\ngrounding, the multimodal incremental transformer\nis used to model the multi-turn dialogue history\ncombined with the speciﬁc visual content to gen-\nerate visually and contextually coherent responses.\nAs an encoder-decoder framework, MITVG con-\ntains a Multimodal Incremental Transformer En-\ncoder (MITE) and a Gated Cross-Attention De-\ncoder (GCAD).\nWe test the effectiveness of our proposed model\non large-scale datasets: VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 (Das\net al., 2017). Both automatic and manual evalu-\nations show that our model substantially outper-\nforms the competitive baselines and achieves the\nnew state-of-the-art results on substantial metrics.\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n• To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst\nto leverage visual grounding to explicitly lo-\ncate related objects in the image guided by\ntextual entities for visual dialogue.\n• We propose a novel multimodal incremental\ntransformer to encode the multi-turn dialogue\nhistory step by step combined with the visual\ncontent and then generate a contextually and\nvisually coherent response.\n• We achieve comparable performance on Vis-\nDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets.\n2 Approach\n2.1 Overview\nIn this section, we formally describe the visual\ndialogue task and then proceed to our proposed\nMultimodal Incremental Transformer with Visual\nGrounding (MITVG).\nFollowing Das et al.(2017), a visual dia-\nlogue agent is given three inputs, i.e., an im-\nage I, a dialogue history (the caption and\nquestion-answer pairs) till round t −1: H =\n(Cap\nH0\n,(Q1,A1)  \nH1\n,··· ,(Qt−1,At−1)  \nHt−1\n) and the cur-\nrent question Qt at round t, where Cap is\nthe caption describing the image taken as H0\nand H1,...,H t−1 are concatenations of question-\nanswer pairs. The goal of the visual dialogue agent\nis to generate a response (or answer)At to the ques-\ntion Qt. Cap, Q∗and A∗are sentences.\nFigure 2 shows the framework of MITVG, which\naims to explicitly model multi-turn dialogue his-\ntory step by step based on the explicit modeling\nrelationship between multiple modalities. MITVG\nﬁrstly locates related objects in the image explicitly\nguided by the textual entities via visual ground-\ning, then encodes multi-turn dialogue history in\nthe order of the dialogue utterance based on visual\ngrounding via Multimodal Incremental Encoder\n(MITE), and ﬁnally utilizes the outputs of both\nencoder and visual grounding to generate the re-\nsponse word by word via Gated Cross-Attention\nDecoder (GCAD).\n2.2 Input Representation\nBefore describing our method, we introduce the\ninput representation.\nImage Features.

MITVG ﬁrstly uses the VG\nmodel to explicitly model the relationship between the textual content and the visual content, and encodes multi-\nturn dialogue history in the order of the dialogue based on visual grounding, and ﬁnally utilizes the outputs of both\nencoder and visual grounding to generate the response word by word in the decoding process.\nlevel image features. Speciﬁcally, the image fea-\ntures vfor an image I are represented by:\nv= Faster R−CNN(I) ∈RK×V , (1)\nwhere Kdenotes the total number of the detected\nobjects per image and V denotes the dimension of\nfeatures for each object.\nLanguage Features. The current (at the t-th\nround) L-word question features are a sequence\nof M-dimension word embedding with positional\nencoding added (Vaswani et al., 2017), as follows:\nqt = [ st,1,st,2,...,s t,L] ∈RL×M , (2)\nst,j = wj + PE(j), (3)\nwhere wj is the word embedding of the j-th word\nin the question Qt, and PE(·) denotes positional\nencoding function (Vaswani et al., 2017). For the\ndialogue history H = {H0,H1,...,H t−1}and\nthe answer At, the dialogue history features u =\n{u0,u1,...,u t−1}and the answer features at are\nobtained in the same way as the question Qt.\n2.3 Visual Grounding\nTo exclude the needless visual content, we intro-\nduce visual grounding, which is deﬁned to ground\na natural language query (phrase or sentence) about\nan image onto a correct region of the image. First\nof all, we use NeuralCoref 1 for reference resolu-\ntion. For example, when it processes the question\nQ4 “are they wearing matching uniforms ?” shown\nin Figure 1, NeuralCoref takes the question Q4 and\nits history as inputs, and then generates a new ques-\ntion “are the people wearing matching uniforms\n?” as a new Q4. As shown in Figure 3 (a), visual\ngrounding model (Yang et al., 2019b) takes thei-th\nquestion Qi and the image I as inputs and gener-\nates initial visual grounding features, as follows:\nv(0)\ngi = VGM(Qi,I), (4)\nwhere VGM(·) denotes visual grounding model2.\nThen v(0)\ngi is sent to the multi-head self-attention\n1Introduction and code of NeuralCoref are available at\nhttps://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref.

After Nv layers computation, we obtain the\nﬁnal visual grounding features vgi by:\nvgi = v(Nv)\ngi , (7)\nActually, there are some questions that do not con-\ntain any entities in the visual dialogue, such as\n“anything else ?”. For such questions, we use the\nfeatures of the whole image instead, i.e. vgi = v.\n2.4 Multimodal Incremental Transformer\nInspired by the idea of incremental transformer (Li\net al., 2019) which is originally designed for the\nsingle-modal dialogue task, we make an extension\nand propose a multimodal incremental transformer,\nwhich is composed of a Multimodal Incremental\nTransformer Encoder (MITE) and a Gated Cross-\nAttention Decoder (GCAD). The MITE uses an\nincremental encoding scheme to encode multi-turn\n3For simplicity, we omit the descriptions of layer normal-\nization and residual connection.\ndialogue history with an understanding of the im-\nage. The GCAD leverages the outputs from both\nthe encoder and visual grounding via the gated\ncross-attention layer to fuse the two modal informa-\ntion in order to generate a contextually and visually\ncoherent response word by word.\n2.4.1 MITE\nTo effectively encode multi-turn utterances\ngrounded in visual content, we design the Mul-\ntimodal Incremental Transformer Encoder (MITE).\nAs shown in Figure 3 (b), at the i-th round, where\ni= 1,2,...,t −1, the MITE takes the visual ground-\ning features vgi , the dialogue history features ui\nand the context state ci−1 as inputs, and utilizes\nattention mechanism to incrementally build up the\nrepresentation of the relevant dialogue history and\nthe associated image regions, and then outputs the\nnew context state ci. This process can be stated\nrecursively as follows:\nci = MITE (vgi ,ui,ci−1) , (8)\nwhere MITE(·) denotes the encoding function, ci\ndenotes the context state after the dialogue history\nfeatures ui and the visual grounding featuresvgi be-\ning encoded, and c0 is the dialogue history features\nu0.\nAs shown in Figure 3 (b), we use a stack of Nh\nidentical layers to encode vgi , ui and ci−1, and to\ngenerate ci. Each layer consists of four sub-layers.\nThe ﬁrst sub-layer is a multi-head self-attention\nfor the dialogue history:\nA(n) = MultiHead\n(\nC(n−1),C(n−1),C(n−1)\n)\n,\n(9)\nwhere n= 1,...,N h, C(n−1) is the output of the\nlast layer Nn−1, and C(0) is the dialog history fea-\ntures ui. The second sub-layer is a multi-head\ncross-modal attention:\nB(n) = MultiHead (An,vgi ,vgi ) , (10)\nwhere vgi is the visual grounding features. The\nthird sub-layer is a multi-head history attention:\nF(n) = MultiHead\n(\nB(n),ci−1,ci−1\n)\n, (11)\nwhere ci−1 is the context state after the previous di-\nalogue history features ui−1 being encoded. That’s\nwhy we call this encoder “Multimodal Incremental\nTransformer”. The fourth sub-layer is a position\nwise feed-forward network (FFN):\nC(n) = FFN\n(\nF(n)\n)\n. (12)\n440\nWe useci to denote the ﬁnal representation atNh-th\nlayer:\nci = C(Nh). (13)\nThe mulitmodal incremental transformer encoder\nat the current turn t, i.e., the bottom one in Figure 2,\nhas the same structure as all the other MITEs but\ntakes the visual grounding features vgt , the current\nquestion features qt and the context state ct−1 as\ninputs and generates the ﬁnal context state ct.\n2.4.2 GCAD\nMotivated by the real-world human cognitive pro-\ncess, we design a Gated Cross-Attention Decoder\n(GCAD) shown in Figure 2, which takes the\nmasked answer features a<z (where z= 1,2,...,Z\nand Z is the length of the answer), encoder out-\nputs ct and visual grounding features vgt as inputs,\nand generates contextually and visually coherent\nresponses grounded in an image. GCAD is com-\nposed of a stack of Ny identical layers, each of\nwhich has three sub-layers.\nThe ﬁrst sub-layer is a multi-head self-\nattention as follows:\nJ(n) = MultiHead\n(\nR(n−1),R(n−1),R(n−1)\n)\n,\n(14)\nwhere n= 1,...,N y, R(n−1) is the output of the\nprevious layer, and R(0) is the masked answer fea-\ntures a<z.\nThe second sub-layer is a multi-head gated\ncross-modal attention layer (GCA) as shown in\nFigure 4, calculated as:\nP(n) = α(n) ◦E(n) + β(n) ◦G(n), (15)\nwhere n= 1,...,N y, ◦denotes Hadamard prod-\nuct, E(n) and G(n) denote the outputs of two cross-\nattention functions, computed as follows:\nE(n) = MultiHead\n(\nJ(n),ct,ct\n)\n, (16)\nG(n) = MultiHead\n(\nJ(n),vgt ,vgt\n)\n, (17)\nwhere α(n), β(n) are two gates4:\nα(n) = σ\n(\nWE[J(n),E(n)] +bE\n)\n, (18)\nβ(n) = σ\n(\nWG[J(n),G(n)] +bG\n)\n, (19)\nwhere σdenotes sigmoid function, WE, WG, bE,\nbG are learnable parameters, and [·,·] indicates con-\ncatenation.\n4Our inspiration comes from Cornia et al.

(22)\n3 Experiments\n3.1 Datasets\nWe conduct experiments on the VisDial v0.9 and\nv1.0 datasets (Das et al., 2017) to verify our ap-\nproach. VisDial v0.9 contains 83k dialogs on\nCOCO-train (Lu et al., 2017) and 40k dialogs on\nCOCO-val images as test set, for a total of 1.23M\ndialog question-answer pairs. VisDial v1.0 dateset\nis an extension of VisDial v0.9 dateset with addi-\ntional 10k COCO-like images from Flickr. VisDial\nv1.0 dateset contains 123k, 2k and 8k images as\ntrain, validation and test splits, respectively.\n3.2 Implementation and Evaluation\nImplementation Details. Following previous\nwork (Das et al., 2017), in order to represent words\nwe ﬁrstly lowercase all the texts and convert digits\nto words, and then remove contractions before tok-\nenization. The captions, questions and answers are\nfurther truncated to ensure that they are not longer\nthan 40, 20 and 20 tokens, respectively.

To represent image\nregions, we use Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015b)\nwith ResNet-101 (He et al., 2016) ﬁnetuned on the\nVisual Genome dataset (Krishna et al., 2017), thus\nobtaining a 2048-dimensional feature vector for\neach region. The layers of our encoder, decoder\nand visual grounding module are all set to 3. The\nnumber of attention heads in multi-head attention is\n8 and the ﬁlter size is 2048. The word embedding\nis shared by the history, questions and responses.\nThe dimension of word embedding is set to 512 em-\npirically. We use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) for\noptimization, following the learning rate schedul-\ning strategy of Vaswani et al. (2017). Our model\nis implemented using PyTorch v1.0, Python v3.6,\nand provides out of the box support with CUDA\n9 and CuDNN 7. We train our model on TITAN\nXP with 8 GPUs. For each epoch, we spend about\n9,000 seconds on training the model. The total\nparameters are about 56.79M.\nBefore we train our model, we use three exter-\nnal tools for image features extracting, reference\nresolution and visual grounding.\nImage Features Extracting We extract im-\nage features of VisDial images, using a Faster-\nRCNN (Ren et al., 2015b) with ResNet-101 (He\net al., 2016) pre-trained on Visual Genome (Kr-\nishna et al., 2017), introduction and code\nfrom https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-\nup-attention.\nReference Resolution we use NeuralCoref v4.0\nfor reference resolution, which is developed by\nhuggingface. Introduction and code are available\nat https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref.\nVisual Grounding We use One-Stage Visual\nGrounding Model (Yang et al., 2019b) to ob-\ntain the visual grounding features. Introduction\nand code are available at https://github.com/zyang-\nur/onestage grounding.\nAutomatic Evaluation. We use a retrieval set-\nting to evaluate individual responses at each round\nof a dialogue, following Das et al. (2017). Specif-\n442\nically, at test time, apart from the image, ground\ntruth dialogue history and the question, a list of\n100-candidate answers is also given. The model is\nevaluated on retrieval metrics: (1) rank of human\nresponse (Mean, the lower the better), (2) existence\nof the human response in top−kranked responses,\ni.e., R@k(3) mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the\nhuman response (the higher the better) and (4) nor-\nmalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) for\nVisDial v1.0 (the higher the better). During eval-\nuation, we use the log-likelihood scores to rank\ncandidate answers.\nHuman Evaluation. We randomly extract 100\nsamples for human evaluation according to Wu et al.\n(2018), and then ask 3 human subjects to guess\nwhether the last response in the dialogue is human-\ngenerated or machine-generated. If at least 2 of\nthem agree it is generated by a human, we think it\npasses the Truing Test (M1). In addition, we record\nthe percentage of responses that are evaluated better\nthan or equal to human responses (M2), according\nto the human subjects’ evaluation.\n3.3 Main Results\nWe compare our proposed model to the state-\nof-the-art generative models developed in previ-\nous work. Current encoder-decoder based gen-\nerative models can be divided into tree facets.\n(1) Fusion-based models: LF (Das et al., 2017)\nand HREA (Das et al., 2017) directly encode the\nmultimodal inputs and decode the answer. (2)\nAttention-based models: HCIAE (Lu et al., 2017),\nCoAtt (Wu et al., 2018), Primary (Guo et al.,\n2019a), ReDAN (Gan et al., 2019), DV AN (Guo\net al., 2019b) and DMRM (Chen et al., 2020a),\nDAM, LTMI, KBGN.

(4) The pretraining model:\nVDBERT (Wang et al., 2020).\nAs shown in Table 1 and Table 2, our MITVG,\nwhich explicitly locates related objects guided by\nthe textual entities and implements a multimodal\nincremental transformer to incrementally build the\nrepresentation of the dialogue history and the im-\nage, achieves comparable performance on the Vis-\nDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets. Speciﬁcally, our model\noutperforms previous work by a signiﬁcant margin\nboth on the VisDial v0.9 dataset (0.87 on MRR,\n0.31 on R@1, 1.17 on R@5, 0.75 on R10) and the\nVisDial v1.0 dataset (0.98 on MRR, 0.76 on R@1,\n1.23 on R@5, 1.28 on R10, 0.82 on Mean, and\nDMRM MITVG\nMethod 1 (M1) 0.62 0.76\nMethod 2 (M2) 0.59 0.70\nTable 3: Human evaluation on 100 sampled responses\non VisDial val v1.0. M1: percentage of responses pass\nthe Turing Test. M2: percentage of responses evaluated\nbetter than or equal to human responses.\n1.00 on NDCG). The improvement of R@10 is the\nlargest and our method also gains a large increase\non MRR and R@1 due to the explicit modeling\nof multiple modalities (Seeing Sec 3.5 for further\nquantitative analysis).\nAs shown in Table 3, we conduct human study\nto further prove the effectiveness of our model.\nOur model achieves the highest scores both on the\nmetric M1 (0.76) and M2 (0.70) compared with\nthe previous model, DMRM (Chen et al., 2020a).\nThese results show that our model can generate a\nbetter contextually and visually coherent response.\n3.4 Ablation Study\nWe also conduct an ablation study to illustrate the\nvalidity of our proposed Multimodal Incremental\nTransformer with Visual Grounding. The results\nare shown in Table 4.\nWe implement Multimodal Incremental Trans-\nformer without Visual Grounding (‘MITVG w/o\nVG’) to verify the validity of visual grounding.\nAs shown in Table 4, comparing ‘MITVG w/o\nVG’ with MITVG, we ﬁnd the metrics decrease\nobviously (0.46 on MRR, 0.60 on R@1, 0.68 on\nR@5, 0.46 on R@10 and 0.59 on Mean) if visual\ngrounding is deleted from MITVG. This observa-\ntion demonstrates the validity of visual grounding.\nTo verify the effectiveness of the incremental\ntransformer architecture, we implement a Multi-\nmodal Incremental LSTM without Visual Ground-\ning (‘MI-LSTM w/o VG’). A 3-layer bidirectional\nLSTM (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997) with multi-\nhead attention and a 1-layer LSTM with GCA are\napplied for encoder and decoder, respectively. All\nthe LSTM hidden state size is 512. Results in\nTable 4 demonstrate the effectiveness of our incre-\nmental transformer architecture (compare ‘MITVG\nw/o VG’ with ‘MI-LSTM w/o VG’). Results from\nthe comparison between ‘MITVG w/o VG’ and\nDMRM (Chen et al., 2020a) also show the validity\nof our incremental transformer to some extent.\n443\nQ1: how tall is the stack ?\nGT: 3 suitcases             Ours: 3 suitcases \nQ2: what color are they ?\nGT: blue and 2 red       Ours : blue and 2 red\nQ3: what do you think they contain ?\nGT: probably clothes   Ours: probably clothes\nCaption: a stack of luggage below a framed photo\nof a map\nQ1: is the photo in color ?\nGT: yes                  Ours: yes\nQ2: how many giraffes ?\nGT: more than 3    Ours: 3\nQ3: is it daytime ?\nGT: yes                  Ours: yes\nCaption: several giraffes gather at an elevated \nplatform to take food from zoo visitors\n(𝑎) (𝑏)\nFigure 5: Case study.

As shown in Fig-\nure 5 (a), owing to the explicit understanding of\nvisual content via visual grounding and the mul-\ntimodal incremental transformer architecture, our\nMITVG generates responses in keeping with hu-\nman answers. For example, while answering the\nquestion Q1 ‘‘how tall is the stack ?” and Q2 “what\ncolor are they ?”, our model grounds the three suit-\ncases accurately via visual grounding, thus giving\nthe accurate responses “3 suitcases” and “blue and\n2 red”. However, as shown in Figure 5 (b), for\nquestions Q2, MITVG gives a wrong answer be-\ncause it focuses on wrong number of objects in the\nquestion by visual grounding.\n4 Related Work\nVisual Dialogue. Our work touches two\nbranches of the research in visual dialogue. One\nis how to leverage image features. Niu et al.\n(2019) utilize object-level image features as visual\nattention and reﬁne it by recursively reviewing the\ndialog history. Gan et al. (2019) and Chen et al.\n(2020a) regard the object-level image features\nas visual memory to infer answers progressively\nthrough multiple steps. The other is how to model\ndialogue history. Yang et al. (2019a) propose a new\ntraining paradigm inspired by actor-critic policy\ngradient (Sutton et al., 1999) for history-advantage\ntraining. Guo et al. (2020) represent each turn\ndialogue history with visual content as a node in\na context-aware graph neural network. Park et al.\n(2020) reﬁne history information from both topic\naggregation and context matching. Different from\nthese approaches, we explicitly establish speciﬁc\nmapping of objects and textual entities to exclude\nundesired visual content via visual grounding,\nand model multi-turn structure of the dialogue\nbased on visual grounding to develop a uniﬁed\nrepresentation combining multi-turn utterances\n444\nalong with the relevant objects.\nIncremental Structures. There are some suc-\ncesses on introducing the incremental structure into\ntasks related to dialog systems (Zilka and Jurcicek,\n2015; Coman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Das et al.,\n2017). In particular, Coman et al. (2019) propose\nan incremental dialog state tracker which is updated\non a token basis from incremental transcriptions.\nLi et al. (2019) devise an incremental transformer\nto encode multi-turn utterances along with knowl-\nedge in related documents for document grounded\nconversations. Das et al. (2017) propose a dialog-\nRNN to produce an encoding for this round and a\nstate for next round. Our model is different from\nthese approaches mainly in two aspects: 1) we ex-\nplicitly model the relationship between modalities,\ni.e., textual utterance and image objects, in visual\ndialogue through visual grounding; 2) based on the\nexplicit association between modalities, our model\nincrementally encodes the dialogue history and the\nimage with well-designed incremental multimodal\narchitecture to sufﬁciently understand the dialogue\ncontent, thus generating better responses.\n5 Conclusion\nWe propose a novel Multimodal Incremental Trans-\nformer with Visual Grounding for visual dia-\nlogue, named MITVG, which consists of two key\nparts: visual grounding and multimodal incremen-\ntal transformer. Visual grounding aims to explicitly\nmodel the relationship between multiple modalities.\nBased on visual grounding, multimodal incremen-\ntal transformer aims to explicitly model multi-turn\ndialogue history in the order of the dialogue. Exper-\niments on the VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets show\nthat our model achieves comparable performance.\nReferences\nShubham Agarwal, Trung Bui, Joon-Young Lee, Ioan-\nnis Konstas, and Verena Rieser. 2020.
