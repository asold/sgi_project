INTRODUCTION\nSolid-state transformer (SST) is commonly regarded as\na prototype of energy router, which is expected to have\nbroad applications in the future smart power grids [1], [2].\nUnlike conventional power frequency magnetic transformer,\nSST is a combination of power electronic converters and\nmedium- or high-frequency transformer, which can facili-\ntate bi-directional power ﬂow and is suitable for AC/DC\ngrids [3]. Moreover, besides the advantage of its reduced size\nand weight, SST features several additional functionalities\nincluding fault isolation and harmonic suppression [4].\nIn recent years, the application of SST in distribution\nsystems has gained increasing attention. The implementation\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Sourabh Khandelwal.\nof an SST with a simple two-level or three-level converter\ninto the distribution systems is not cost effective due to\nthe high rated voltage of the required power devices [5].\nAs such, adopting cascaded stages or multilevel converters\nof cost-effective low-voltage power electronic devices has\nbeen investigated in the literature [6]. Additionally, high-\nvoltage power devices based on wide bandgap materials such\nas silicon carbide (SiC) IGBT that is capable of handling high\nvoltage up to 25 kV are under development and soon they\nwill be available for practical application [7]. Furthermore,\ncombination of modular topologies and high-voltage power\ndevices can acquire even higher voltage levels.\nFrom topological point of view, the two most widely used\nSST structures are the single-phase SST topology based on\ncascaded H-bridge rectiﬁers [8] and the three-phase SST\ntopology based on modular multilevel converters (MMC) [9].\nVOLUME 7, 2019 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Quet al.: Novel Unbalance Compensation Method for Distribution SST\nThe main difference of these two topologies is that the former\nadopts cascaded H-bridge rectiﬁers while the latter employs\nMMCs as the input stage. Compared with MMC-SST, the cas-\ncaded SST exhibits higher power density, employs simpler\ncontrol scheme and possesses better economic indicators\nunder the same requirements of insulation and heat dissipa-\ntion [10]. Therefore, the cascaded topology is selected as the\nresearch object in this paper.\nPrevious studies on SST have focused on aspects such as\ncircuit topology, power control, high-frequency transformer\ndesign, utilization of wide bandgap power devices and SST\napplications [11]–[14]. However, no much attention was paid\nto the control strategy of SST under unbalanced operating\nconditions. Unbalanced operating state of power distribution\nsystems often arises due to power system faults or asymmetric\nloads. If an SST is employed in the power grid without unbal-\nance compensation, negative-sequence current will be gener-\nated and injected to the grid. Simultaneously, the negative-\nsequence current will also lead to unbalanced voltage across\nthe DC capacitor in each phase of the SST, which affects the\nperformance of the SST and may damage its power electronic\ndevices. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a reliable and\ncost-effective compensation method for SST operating under\nthree-phase unbalanced condition.\nThe unbalance compensation of SST can be implemented\nthrough developing suitable topology design or by adopt-\ning an improved control strategy. However, topology design\nmethod will increase the complexity of the circuit and raise\nthe cost [15], [16]. In comparison, compensation method by\nimproved control strategy is more practical and cost-effective.\nCurrently, a common compensation method based on zero-\nsequence voltage injection is widely adopted [17], [18]. This\nmethod requires the calculation of the zero-sequence com-\npensation voltage based on the deviation of the high volt-\nage direct-current (HVDC) capacitor voltage. Hence, a pure\nsinusoidal compensation voltage cannot be achieved which\nresults in a poor power quality. The narrow compensation\nrange of this method is another disadvantage. Another com-\npensation method based on the combination of zero- and\nnegative-sequence components injection is proposed in [19].\nThe basic principle of this method can be brieﬂy interpreted\nas follows: zero-sequence component is used under light\nunbalanced condition whereas negative-sequence component\nis used under severe condition. This method signiﬁcantly\nexpands the compensation range of SST under unbalanced\nload condition. However, the switching point of zero- and\nnegative-sequence components injection should be identiﬁed\nprecisely. Also, the injection of negative-sequence compo-\nnent will pollute the distribution system.\nFor grid-connected inverters, a sequence decomposition\nand compensation control strategy is presented in [20].\nPositive- and negative-sequence current are controlled under\ndual synchronous reference frames and both are regulated by\nproportional integral (PI) controller. Although the method can\neffectively suppress negative-sequence current, the control\nsystem is complex, and the time delay caused by sequence\ndecomposition is inevitable. To eliminate the time delay,\nan improved compensation method based on reduced order\ngeneralized integrator (ROGI) is proposed in [21]. This\nmethod can acquire decent power quality under unbalanced\ngrid voltage, but still requires complicated command current\ncalculation according to the different control objectives.\nTo ﬁll this research gap, this paper proposes a novel com-\npensation method for SST. The proposed technique avoides\nthe sequence decomposition and reference current calcu-\nlation, and thus improves the dynamic response speed of\nthe compensation controller. The proposed control strategy\nis realized by an auxiliary ROGI controller based on cur-\nrent PI closed-loop control method. Adopting this method,\nthe positive- and negative-sequence currents can be con-\ntrolled simultaneously, which signiﬁcantly reduces the com-\nplexity of the control scheme.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II\ninterprets the basic principle of the proposed method.\nSection III presents the unbalanced control scheme for cas-\ncaded SST. Section IV analyzes the unbalance compensation\nability of the proposed method. Section V presents the simu-\nlation results and discussion. Section VI concludes the paper.\nII. UNBALANCE COMPENSATION PRINCIPLE\nA. TOPOLOGY AND MATHEMATICAL MODEL\nA typical cascaded SST topology shown in Fig. 1 consists of\nthree parts: input stage, isolation stage, and output stage.\nFIGURE 1. A typical three-phase cascaded SST topology.\n108594 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Quet al.: Novel Unbalance Compensation Method for Distribution SST\nThe input stage includes three star-connected single-phase\ncascaded H-bridge rectiﬁers which are controlled by carrier\nphase-shift modulation. The isolation stage is a plurality of\nindependent dual active bridge (DAB) converters. Each phase\nof the output stage consists of three voltage source invert-\ners (VSI), and the output terminals of the VSIs are connected\nin parallel to improve the power rating of SST. The output\nstage can provide low-voltage alternating-current (LV AC)\ninterfaces for connection with three-phase AC loads.\nAs shown in Figure 1, there is no neutral line between the\npower source and load. Therefore, there is no zero-sequence\ncurrent in the system.\nWhen the grid voltage and three-phase load power are\nunbalanced, the grid voltage can be expressed as:\n\n\n\nea =Ep cos ( ωt +ϕp) +En cos ( ωt +ϕn)\n+Ez cos ( ωt +ϕz)\neb =Ep cos ( ωt +ϕp −2π\n3 ) +En cos ( ωt +ϕn +2π\n3 )\n+Ez cos ( ωt +ϕz)\nec =Ep cos ( ωt +ϕp +2π\n3 ) +En cos ( ωt +ϕn −2π\n3 )\n+Ez cos ( ωt +ϕz)\n(1)\nwhere ea, eb, ec are the three phase grid voltages; Ep, En,\nEz are the amplitudes of the positive-, negative- and zero-\nsequence components of the grid voltage; ϕp, ϕn, ϕz are the\nphase angles of the positive-, negative- and zero-sequence\ncomponents; ωis the angular frequency of the grid.\nUnder unbalanced condition, the grid current is composed\nof positive- and negative-sequence components, which can be\nexpressed as:\n\n\n\nia =Ip cos ( ωt +θp) +In cos ( ωt +θn)\nib =Ip cos ( ωt +θp −2π\n3 ) +In cos ( ωt +θn +2π\n3 )\nic =Ip cos ( ωt +θp +2π\n3 ) +In cos ( ωt +θn −2π\n3 )\n(2)\nwhere ia,ib, ic are the three-phase grid currents; Ip, In are the\namplitude of the positive- and negative-sequence currents; θp,\nθn are the initial phase angles of the positive- and negative-\nsequence currents.\nThe input current of the cascaded H-bridge rectiﬁers can\nbe expressed as:\n\n\nea\neb\nec\n\n−\n\n\nua\nub\nuc\n\n=Ls\nd\ndt\n\n\nia\nib\nic\n\n+\n\n\nRaia\nRbib\nRcic\n\n (3)\nwhere Ls is the ﬁlter inductance at the grid side; Ra, Rb,\nRc represent the equivalent resistances of the input stage.\nNormally, they are very small and can be neglected.\nApplying the dqtransformation on (3) along with neglect-\ning the resistors, the equation in dq coordinate is derived as\nfollows:\n[ed\neq\n]\n−\n[uid\nuiq\n]\n=\n\n\nLs\nd\ndt −ωLs\nωLs Ls\nd\ndt\n\n·\n[id\niq\n]\n(4)\nwhere ed and eq are the d- and q-axis components of the grid\nvoltage; uid and uiq are the d- and q-axis components of the\nconverter ac-side voltage; and id and iq are the d- and q-axis\ncomponents of input current.\nAfter decoupling control, the active and reactive current\ncontrollers can be expressed as:\nd\ndt\n[id\niq\n]\n= 1\nLs\n·\n[KP (i∗\nd −id) KI\n∫\n(i∗\nd −id)dt\nKP (i∗\nq −iq) KI\n∫\n(i∗\nq −iq)dt\n]\n(5)\nwhere KP is the proportional gain; KI is the integral gain; i∗\nd\nand i∗\nq are the d- and q-axis components of command current.\nWhen the system is unbalanced, the negative-sequence\ncomponent of the grid current will be composed of double\nfrequency component in dq coordinate, and the active and\nreactive currents can be expressed as:\n[id\niq\n]\n=\n[i1d\ni1q\n]\n+\n[I2d ·ej(−2ω1t+ϕ0)\nI2q ·ej(−2ω1t+ϕ0)\n]\n(6)\nwhere i1d and i1q are the DC components of the active and\nreactive currents; I2d and I2q are the amplitudes of the active\nand reactive parts of the negative-sequence double frequency\ncomponent; and ϕ0 is the initial phase angle of the negative-\nsequence component.\nIt is not feasible to achieve non-error adjustment of the\nnegative-sequence double frequency component only by\nthe PI controller. Therefore, a compensation method based\non ROGI controller is proposed to suppress the negative-\nsequence current.\nB. UNBALANCE COMPENSATION PRINCIPLE\nThe ROGI controller is obtained by reducing the order of\nthe second order generalized integrator (SOGI) [21]. SOGI\ncan only achieve frequency selection, but ROGI is able to dis-\ntinguish the polarities of frequencies. The transfer functions\nof SOGI and ROGI are given in (7) and (8) respectively.\nGSOGI (s) = 2krs\ns2 +ω2r\n= kr\ns +jωr\n+ kr\ns −jωr\n(7)\nGROGI (s) = kr\ns +jωr\n(8)\nwhere kr represents the integral gain, and ωr represents the\nresonant angular frequency.\nSOGI can be regarded as a combination of two ROGIs\nwith positive- and negative-polarities of resonant frequencies.\nSOGI has two conjugate poles of ±jωr, whereas ROGI has\nonly one pole of −jωr. The magnitude-frequency characteris-\ntic curves of the two integrators are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3,\nrespectively.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 that SOGI has inﬁnite\ngains at ±100Hz, whereas ROGI has an inﬁnite gain at only\n−100Hz. The gains of the two integrators at other frequencies\nVOLUME 7, 2019 108595\nZ. Quet al.: Novel Unbalance Compensation Method for Distribution SST\nFIGURE 2. Magnitude-frequency characteristic of SOGI.\nFIGURE 3. Magnitude-frequency characteristic of ROGI.\nare almost zero. Therefore, ROGI can be used to regulate\nthe negative-sequence double frequency component without\ninﬂuencing the positive-sequence component.\nThe output voltage of ROGI can be expressed as:\n[Ucom\nd\nUcom\nq\n]\n=L−1GROGI (s) ∗\n[i∗\nd −id\ni∗\nq −iq\n]\n=− kr\nj2ω1\n(1 −e−j2ω1t ) ·\n[i1d\ni1q\n]\n−kr\n[I2d t ·ej(−2ω1t+ϕ0)\nI2qt ·ej(−2ω1t+ϕ0)\n]\n(9)\nwhere Ucom\nd and Ucom\nq represent the output compensa-\ntion voltages of the controller; L−1 represents the inverse\nLaplace transform; and ∗represents the convolution operator.\nThe exponential function in the second term of (9) will\nincrease rapidly with the time and its value will be much\nlarger than the ﬁrst term. Then (9) can be simpliﬁed as below.\n[Ucom\nd\nUcom\nq\n]\n=−kr\n[I2dt ·ej(−2ω1t+ϕ0)\nI2qt ·ej(−2ω1t+ϕ0)\n]\n(10)\nAfter positive-sequence decoupling control and negative-\nsequence current suppression, the command voltages of the\ninput stage in dq coordinate can be expressed as:\n[U∗\nd\nU∗\nq\n]\n=\n[Ed\nEq\n]\n−\n[UPI\nd\nUPI\nq\n]\n−kr\n[I2d ·ej(−2ω1t+ϕ0)\nI2q ·ej(−2ω1t+ϕ0)\n]\n(11)\nwhere U∗\nd and U∗\nq are the d- and q-axis command voltages\nof the input stage; UPI\nd and UPI\nq are the d- and q-axis output\nvoltages of the PI controller;\nIt can be seen from (11) that the command voltages of the\ninput stage are only composed of the fundamental positive-\nand negative-sequence components. The positive-sequence\ncomponent is used to control the power ﬂow of SST, and\nthe negative-sequence component is utilized to suppress the\nnegative-sequence grid current.\nIn distribution systems, the grid frequency is allowed to\nhave a ﬂuctuation range of −2.5∼ +1.5Hz [22]. If used\nwithout any frequency margin, the robustness of ROGI will\nget poor as the grid frequency ﬂuctuates. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to introduce a cutoff frequency to increase the gain\nbandwidth range of the controller. Then the ROGI becomes\na reduced order quasi-resonant (ROQR) integrator with a\ntransfer function expressed as:\nGROQR (s) = krωc\ns +jωr +ωc\n(12)\nwhere ωc is the cutoff angular frequency (usually\n5∼15 rad/s).\nThe closed-loop transfer function of the ROQR integrator\nis expressed as\nGclose_ROQR (s) = 2krωc\n(R +sLs)(s +jωr +ωc) +2krωc\n(13)\nwhere R represents the equivalent resistance of the input\nstage’s switching loss and is usually neglected.\nBy substituting s =jωinto (13) and omitting the resistance\nR, the transfer function can be derived as\nGclose_ROQR (s) =\n2krωc\n2krωc−ω2Ls−ωωrLs\n1 +j ωωcLs\n2krωc−ω2Ls−ωωrLs\n(14)\nSetting\n⏐⏐⏐ ωωcLs\n2krωc−ω2Ls−ωωrLs\n⏐⏐⏐=1,the gain bandwidth (BW)\nof the ROQR integrator can be obtained as\nBW =2krωc −ω2Ls −ωωrLs\n2πLs\n(15)\nIf the BW is too small, the controller will lack robustness\nto adapt to the grid frequency ﬂuctuation and the response\nspeed will be slow. On the other hand, if the BW is too\nlarge, the frequency distinction of the controller will be\npoor, which will affect the control precision. Therefore,\nthe BW should be set in a reasonable range, i.e., fmin ≤\nBW ≤fmax. In order to ensure the robustness of the con-\ntroller to adapt to the grid frequency ﬂuctuation, fmin should\nnot be less than the maximum ﬂuctuation range of the\ngrid frequency. In general, the ﬂuctuation of the grid fre-\nquency is usually within ±1.5 Hz, so fmin is set at 1.5 Hz.\nIn order to ensure the frequency distinction of the con-\ntroller, fmax should not be too large, usually set at 30 Hz.\nTherefore, the range of the control parameter ( kr) can be\nderived as\n2πLsfmin +ω(ω+ωr)Ls\n2ωc\n≤kr ≤2πLsfmax +ω(ω+ωr)Ls\n2ωc\n(16)\n108596 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Quet al.: Novel Unbalance Compensation Method for Distribution SST\nFIGURE 4. Root locus diagram of the control system based on ROQR.\nSince kr is closely related to the response speed, frequency\nselectivity and robustness, its design should comprehensively\nconsider the above requirements.\nThe corresponding root locus diagram of the control sys-\ntem based on ROQR is shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that\nwhen kr >0, the root trajectory of the system is always on\nthe left side of the imaginary axis, i.e., all closed-loop poles of\nthe system have negative real parts. It denotes that the control\nsystem is always stable as long as kr is designed in the range\ngiven by (16).\nIII. CONTROL SCHEME FOR CASCADED SST\nWhen the three-phase load is unbalanced, the three-phase\npower ﬂow is also uneven, which will result in a negative-\nsequence component in the grid current. A compensation\nmethod in [23] utilizes a three-phase four-leg inverter at the\noutput stage, but this method increases the complexity of the\ntopology and control scheme, and exhibits a poor compensa-\ntion ability for unbalanced grid voltage. Whereas the control\nstrategy proposed in this paper can not only be ﬁt in the\ncondition of unbalanced grid voltage and asymmetric loads,\nbut also provides decent power quality of AC and DC outputs.\nThe control schemes of SST are elaborated below.\nA. CONTROL SCHEME OF INPUT STAGE\nFor the input stage of SST, there are three control objectives:\nI) maintain the total HVDC voltage and realize the power\nfactor correction; II) achieve voltage equalization between\nthe sub-modules of each phase; III) suppress the negative-\nsequence grid current. To achieve the above control objec-\ntives, the input stage control block diagram proposed in this\npaper is shown in Fig. 5.\nThe control scheme of the input stage consists of\nthree parts: decoupled control of positive-sequence current,\nnegative-sequence current suppression and phase internal\nbalancing control. The decoupled control of the positive-\nsequence current component is aimed to acquire stable aver-\nage HVDC voltage and unity power factor. A notch ﬁlter\nwith a frequency of 100Hz is utilized to extract the positive-\nsequence current in the d- and q-axis. The negative-sequence\ncurrent suppression is achieved by embedding a ROGI con-\ntroller in the positive-sequence synchronous reference frame\nFIGURE 5. Proposed control scheme of the SST input stage. (a) Decoupled\ncontrol of positive-sequence current and negative-sequence current\nsuppression. (b) Phase internal balancing control.\nbased on current decoupled control. Phase internal balancing\ncontrol is responsible for reducing the effects of switching\ndevices power losses and achieving balanced HVDC voltage\namong each sub-module.\nB. CONTROL SCHEME OF ISOLATION STAGE\nThe control objectives of the DAB converters in the iso-\nlation stage are to keep the voltage of the low voltage\ndirect-current (LVDC) capacitors constant and realize bidi-\nrectional power ﬂow. The voltage closed-loop PI controller\nis utilized to maintain the voltage of the LVDC capacitors,\nand the single-phase-shift pulse width modulation (PWM)\nis exploited to implement the bidirectional power ﬂow by\ncontrolling the phase shift angle between the primary and\nsecondary sides of each DAB converter. The proposed control\nscheme of the isolation stage is shown in Fig. 6 in which each\nDAB converter is controlled independently.\nFIGURE 6. Control scheme of the isolation stage.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 108597\nZ. Quet al.: Novel Unbalance Compensation Method for Distribution SST\nFIGURE 7. Control scheme of the output stage.\nC. CONTROL SCHEME OF OUTPUT STAGE\nThe control objectives of the VSIs in the output stage are to\nprovide constant output voltage and balanced current among\nthe parallel VSIs. The proposed control scheme of one phase\nin the output stage is shown in Fig. 7; the control schemes\nof the other two phases are exactly the same. In the proposed\ncontroller, the outer voltage loop regulates the output voltage\nand generates the current reference, while the inner current\nloop tracks the same current reference to achieve current bal-\nancing control among the parallel VSIs. Quasi-proportional\nresonant (PR) controllers are employed in the output stage\nfor its better performance in tracking AC signals. Since the\noutput voltage of each parallel VSI in one phase is identical,\nthe power of each VSI can be controlled by regulating the\ncurrent.\nIV. ICOMPENSATION ABILITY ANALYSIS\nAccording to the national standard in China, the voltage\nﬂuctuation at the point of common coupling in distribution\nsystems should be less than 2% ∼4% [24]. Simultaneously,\nthere are lots of asymmetric loads in distribution systems, and\nthe unbalance factor of loads may be more severe than the\ngrid voltage ﬂuctuation. Therefore, the compensation ability\nof the proposed control scheme for three-phase unbalanced\nloads is emphatically analyzed in this section.\nWith the unbalance compensation, the three-phase grid\ncurrent is controlled and balanced. However, the voltage of\nthe HVDC capacitors will drift from their command value\ndue to the unbalanced load. If the unbalance factor is severely\nhigh, it may result in distortion and potentially damaging\npower devices by overvoltage. Hence, the stability margin of\nthe input stage is determined by the voltage of the HVDC\ncapacitors. In other words, the SST can’t operate stably unless\nthe voltage of each HVDC capacitor does not exceed the\nmaximum allowable value.\nAs the phase internal balancing controller is adopted,\nthe HVDC voltage of sub-modules in each phase is already\nbalanced. Therefore, the power devices will not be damaged\nby the overvoltage as long as the average voltage of the\nHVDC capacitors in each phase does not exceed the maxi-\nmum permissible value.\nFor simplicity, this paper assumes that the power loss\namong different phases and sub-modules are the same and\ncan be neglected. Therefore, the output power of each phase\nis expressed as follows:\n\n\n\nUdc_aIdc_a ≈Pa\nUdc_bIdc_b ≈Pb\nUdc_cIdc_c ≈Pc\n(17)\nwhere Udc_a, Udc_b, Udc_c are the average voltages of the-\nHVDC capacitors of each phase; Idc_a, Idc_b, Idc_c are the\nrated root-mean-square values of the three-phase grid cur-\nrents.\nOnce the grid current is balanced, i.e., Idc_a = Idc_b =\nIdc_c =Idc, the output power of each phase is proportional to\nthe average HVDC capacitor voltage of each phase. Suppose\nthat the three-phase output power is expressed as follows:\n\n\n\nPa =ka ·PLN\nPb =kb ·PLN\nPc =kc ·PLN\n(ka >kb >kc ≥0) (18)\nwhere PLN is the rated load power.\nThe unbalance factor of the three-phase load power is\ncalculated as:\n1P% =Pmax −Pmin\nPave\n= 3(ka −kc)\nka +kb +kc\n×100% (19)\nwhere Pmax is the maximum load power among the three\nphases and Pave is the average load power of the three-phases.\nTo ensure that the average HVDC capacitor voltage\nof each phase does not exceed the maximum permissible\nvalue ( Ulim), the limitation equation of the output power is\nderived as follows:\nmax ( Pa,Pb,Pc)\nIdc\n=ka ·PLN\nIdc\n≤Ulim (20)\nSubstituting (18) and (19) into (20), the limitation equation\nof the unbalance factor among the three-phase load is derived\nas follows:\n1P% ≤ 3(Ulim ·Idc −kc ·PLN)\n(kb +kc) ·PLN +Ulim ·Idc\n(21)\nOnly the control objectives of the input stage are consid-\nered when analyzing the compensation ability of the SST\nin most literatures. However, the control of the isolation\nstage and input stage are not completely decoupled. When\nthe HVDC capacitors voltage is too low, the correspond-\ning LVDC capacitors voltage will be also too low to track\nthe command voltage. Therefore, the voltage of the HVDC\ncapacitors after unbalance compensation should not be less\nthan a pre-deﬁned minimum voltage that can maintain the\nLVDC capacitors voltage constant.\nThe relationship between the output power, input and\noutput voltage and phase-shift angle of DAB converters is\nderived in [25], as given below:\nPo =nUdc_HUdc_Lϕ(π−ϕ)\n2π2fsLk\n(−π\n2 <ϕ< π\n2 ) (22)\nwhere n is the ratio of the high-frequency transformer; ϕis the\nphase-shift angle of the DAB converters; fs is the switching\n108598 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ.

Simulation parameters of cascaded SST circuit.\nfrequency of the isolation stage and Lk is the leakage induc-\ntance of the high-frequency transformer.\nIgnoring the power losses of the VSIs, the output power of\nthe DAB converters in each phase will be equal to the rated\nload power, i.e.:\nN ·Po =PLN =U2\ndc_L\n/\nRL (23)\nwhere N is the number of cascaded modules; RL represents\nthe equivalent resistance of the load.\nSubstituting (22) into (23), the relationship of the input and\noutput voltages of the DAB converters can be derived as:\nUdc_H =Udc_L · 2π2fsLk\nnϕ(π−ϕ)NRL\n(24)\nOne of the control objectives of the isolation stage is to\nmaintain the LVDC capacitors voltage constant. When ϕ is\nequal to 0.5, the voltage of the LVDC capacitors reaches a\nminimum value. The limitation equation of the output power\nat this condition is derived as follows:\nmin ( Pa,Pb,Pc)\nIdc\n=kc ·PLN\nIdc\n≥Umin (25)\nwhere Umin is the minimum allowable value of the voltage of\nthe LVDC capacitors.\nSubstituting (18) and (24) into (25), the limitation equation\nof the three-phase unbalance factor is derived as follows:\n1P% ≤ 3(ka −fsLkIdc)\n(ka +kb) ·nNUdc_L +fsLkIdc\n(26)\nThe compensation ability of the proposed control scheme\nfor unbalanced load can be obtained by (21) and (26). It can\nalso be concluded that when designing the HVDC capacitor,\nthe voltage margin should be considered to cope with the\nthree-phase unbalanced condition.\nFIGURE 8.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nTo verify the effectiveness of the proposed ROGI-based\nunbalance compensation method, a three-module cascaded\nSST simulation model with a three-phase star connection as\nshown in Fig. 1 has been built in MATLAB/Simulink. The\nmain parameters of the simulation model are listed in Table 1.\nSimulation studies are carried out under three situations:\na) ideal grid and balanced load; b) unbalanced load; c) severe\ngrid voltage drop. Results of these case studies are presented\nand discussed below.\nA.

(g) Voltage of all sub-modules HVDC capacitors.\nideal grid and balanced load, the grid voltage and load power\nfor the three phases are assumed to be identical, i.e., 1:1:1.\nSimulation results of this case study are shown in Fig. 8.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 8(a) that the three-phase grid-\nconnected current of the SST is symmetric under ideal grid\nand balanced load condition, and the total harmonic distor-\ntion (THD) of the current is only 1.17%. Taking one phase\nas an example, Fig. 8(b) shows that the grid voltage and\ncurrent are in phase, which indicates that the SST operates at\nunity power factor. Fig. 8(c) shows that the LVDC capacitor\nvoltage control performance is excellent. Fig. 8(d) shows\nthat the three-phase load current is balanced with a THD of\n0.71% only.\nThe simulation results of case A indicate that the proposed\ncompensation scheme in this paper does not affect the power\nquality and operation ability of the SST under ideal grid and\nbalanced load condition.\nB. UNBALANCED LOAD CONDITION\nIn order to testify the compensation effects and response\nspeed of the proposed control scheme, the ratio of the three-\nphase load power is changed from 1:1:1 to 1:0.8:0.5 at 0.45 s.\nThe simulation results of this case study are shown in Fig. 9.\nFig. 9(a) shows that the load power is becoming unbal-\nanced at t =0.45s as per the ratios speciﬁed above. It can\nbe seen from Fig. 9(b) that the grid-connected current is\n108600 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Quet al.: Novel Unbalance Compensation Method for Distribution SST\nFIGURE 10.

(c) Three phase grid current with\ncompensation based on ROGI controller.\nbecoming asymmetric when the SST operates under unbal-\nanced load condition without any compensation technique.\nIn this case, a negative-sequence current will be injected into\nthe power grid.\nFig. 9(c) and Fig. 9(d) depict the grid-connected current\nof the SST with the conventional sequence compensation\nbased on dual synchronous reference frame and the proposed\nmethod in this paper; respectively. While both compensation\ntechniques are successful in retaining the balance of the grid-\nconnected current, the ROGI-based unbalance compensation\ncontrol scheme shows a rapid response time. It can be seen\nfrom Fig. 9(c) and Fig. 9(d) that the grid-connected currents\nare compensated after 0.04 s when the ROGI-based compen-\nsation scheme is adopted, whereas the response time is 0.15 s\nwhen the sequence compensation is used. This indicates that\nthe proposed compensation scheme features better dynamic\nperformance than the traditional method.\nFig. 9(e) shows that the grid voltage and current are still\nin phase after compensation, which indicates that the SST\nis still operating at unity power factor condition during the\ncompensation process.\nFig. 9(f) presents the average voltage waveform of the\nHVDC capacitors. It can be seen that the average voltage of\ncapacitors deviates from 4 kV for a while, but quickly returns\nto the command value.\nFig. 9(g) illustrates the voltage waveforms of all sub-\nmodules HVDC capacitors. It can be seen that the HVDC\ncapacitors voltage of each phase is unbalanced after the com-\npensation process, but the highest voltage does not exceed\n4.5kV. If the voltage margin is taken into consideration when\nselecting power devices, the unbalance in case B is still within\nthe compensation capability of the proposed method.\nIn order to quantify the compensation effects intuitively,\nthe three-phase unbalance factor of current is introduced [26],\nwhich is deﬁned as follows:\n1Is% =is max −is min\nis_ave\n×100% (27)\nwhere ismax and ismin are the maximum and minimum peak\nvalues of the three-phase grid currents, respectively; is_ave is\nthe average value of the three-phase current amplitudes.\nA numerical comparison of the compensation effects based\non the conventional and proposed control schemes is pre-\nsented in Table 2.\nTABLE 2. Comparison of unbalance compensation effects based on\nconventional and proposed control schemes.\nIt is obvious to conclude from the Table 2 that the ROGI-\nbased compensation scheme has better steady- and dynamic-\ncompensation performances than the conventional sequence\ncompensation. This attributed to the quarter cycle time delay\ncaused by the decomposition of positive- and negative-\nsequence currents when the sequence compensation scheme\nis adopted. Moreover, the complex coordinate transforma-\ntion and command current calculation of the conventional\ntechnique decrease the compensation precision. Conversely,\nROGI-based compensation scheme precludes the above pro-\ncess, which deﬁnitely improves the response speed and per-\nformance of the controller.\nC. SEVERE GRID VOLTAGE DROP\nIn order to verify the robustness of the proposed technique\nunder grid signiﬁcant voltage drop condition, ea is assumed\nto experience a voltage drop of 30% at 0.45 s while the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 108601\nZ. Quet al.: Novel Unbalance Compensation Method for Distribution SST\nTABLE 3. The compensation effects of SST under severe grid voltage drop\ncondition.\nthree-phase load is balanced. The simulation results of this\ncase study are shown in Fig. 10.\nFig. 10(a) shows the 30% drop of phase-A voltage at\nt =0.45 s as speciﬁed above. Fig. 10(b) presents the grid-\nconnected current of the SST when the grid experiences a\nvoltage drop. Fig. 10(c) presents the gird-connected current\nwhen the proposed compensation control scheme is adopted.\nIt can be seen from the Fig. 10(c) that the grid current is\nretained balancing condition when the ROGI-based compen-\nsation scheme is utilized. Thus, the grid current of a particular\nphase will not be much larger than the other two phases and\nthe largest power device current will be lower than the case\nwithout compensation.\nThe unbalance factor for this case study is calculated and\npresented in Table 3.\nAccording to the results in Fig. 10 and Table 3, it can\nbe concluded that the SST with the proposed ROGI-based\ncompensation scheme can not only deal with the unbalanced\nload, but can also be equipped with the ability to withstand\nvoltage drop.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn order to enhance the ability of cascaded SST to cope with\nunbalanced conditions, this paper proposes a new ROGI-\nbased compensation control scheme, which can suppress\nthe negative-sequence current on the grid side by embed-\nding a ROGI on the basis of current PI closed-loop con-\ntrol method in positive synchronous reference frame. The\nsimulation results proved that: a) the proposed compensa-\ntion scheme can effectively retain symmetrical grid currents\nand suppress the negative-sequence current under unbal-\nanced condition; b) the response speed and compensation\nperformance of the proposed technique are much better\nthan the conventional sequence compensation scheme; c) the\nproposed compensation scheme does not affect the power\nquality and operation performance of the SST under ideal\ngrid and balanced load condition; d) the SST with ROGI-\nbased control scheme has the ability to withstand severe\nvoltage drop.\nCompared with the conventional compensation tech-\nniques, the proposed method is cost effective and easy to\nimplement.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
