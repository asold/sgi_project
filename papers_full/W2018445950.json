Recent studies indicate that tumour response in this setting may predict\nlong-term outcome of patients on adjuvant endocrine therapy, which argues for its broader application in treating hormone receptor-\npositive disease. From the research perspective, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy provides a unique opportunity for studies of\nendocrine responsiveness and the development of novel therapeutic agents.\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2010) 103, 759–764. doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6605845 www.bjcancer.com\nPublished online 10 August 2010\n& 2010 Cancer Research UK\nKeywords: breast cancer; oestrogen receptor; neoadjuvant endocrine therapy; genomics; relapse risk\n/C12/C12/C12\n/C12\n/C12/C12/C12\n/C12\n/C12/C12/C12\n/C12\n/C12/C12/C12\n/C12\n/C12\n/C12/C12/C12\n/C12\n/C12/C12/C12\n/C12\n/C12/C12/C12\n/C12\n/C12/C12/C12\n/C12\nFor patients with locally advanced breast cancer, neoadjuvant\nchemotherapy is commonly recommended to improve surgical\noutcomes. However, for postmenopausal women with oestrogen\nreceptor (ER)-positive disease, endocrine treatment is a logical\nalternative because of its established efficacy in the adjuvant\nsetting (EBCTCG, 2005) and the increasing recognition that\nchemotherapy may be less effective in ER þ HER2/C0 disease\n(Berry et al , 2006; Hayes et al , 2007). Historically, neoadjuvant\nendocrine therapy was reserved for older and frail patients with\nER þ breast cancer. However, recent studies of this treatment\nmodality in younger and healthier postmenopausal women showed\nthat the improved surgical outcomes and response observed with\nthe endocrine approach do not show an interaction with age\n(Olson et al , 2009), justifying the increased acceptance of\nneoadjuvant endocrine therapy in younger postmenopausal\nwomen with better performance status. For premenopausal\nwomen, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy remains investigational.\nIn this review, we will present results of the major neoadjuvant\naromatase inhibitor (AI) trials and discuss recent progress in using\nneoadjuvant endocrine therapy as a research tool to assess\nendocrine responsiveness and evaluate novel therapeutic inter-\nventions.\nNEOADJUVANT ENDOCRINE THERAPY:\nTHE CLINICAL DATA\nThe potential benefit of endocrine therapy in the neoadjuvant\nsetting was initially suggested in earlier studies of tamoxifen, as a\nprimary treatment approach for elderly women with breast cancer\nwho were too frail to undergo other forms of therapy such as surgery\n(Preece et al , 1982; Horobin et al , 1991; Bergman et al , 1995).\nThe clinical response rate was in the range of 30% and higher, with\nlong-lasting responses observed in some of these patients (Preece\net al , 1982; Bergman et al , 1995). Subsequent randomised trials of\ntamoxifen vs surgery followed by tamoxifen conducted in elderly\nwomen with operable breast cancer showed that surgery is essential\nfor optimal local control, but tamoxifen alone achieved a similar\noverall survival compared with surgery followed by tamoxifen\n(Willsher et al , 1997; Mustacchi et al , 2003; Hind et al ,2 0 0 6 ;\nChakrabartiet al, 2010). These investigations laid the foundation for\nthe design of subsequent studies of AIs in younger and healthier\npostmenopausal women with bulky hormone receptor (HR)-positive\ndisease to achieve better surgery outcome. The letrozole P024 trial\n(Eiermann et al , 2001), the Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole,\nTamoxifen or Combined with Tamoxifen (IMPACT) trial (Smith\net al, 2005) and the Preoperative ‘Arimidex’ Compared to Tamoxifen\n(PROACT) trial (Cataliotti et al , 2006) were three of these studies\n(Table 1).\nIn the P024 trial, letrozole treatment was associated with a\nstatistically significant improvement in the rate of breast\nconservation compared with tamoxifen. The anastrozole-based\nIMPACT and PROACT trials also showed a trend favouring the AI\narm, although the results in comparison with tamoxifen were not\nstatistically significant (Smith et al , 2005; Cataliotti et al , 2006).\nA meta-analysis of these trials supported the notion that an AI was\nmore effective than tamoxifen for promoting breast conservation\n(Seo et al , 2009). A promising 76% rate of breast conservation was\nalso observed in a single arm phase II study of neoadjuvant\nexemestane in postmenopausal patients with HR þ tumours 3 cm\nor greater after 12 weeks of therapy (Mlineritsch et al , 2008). The\nAmerican College of Surgeons Oncology Group has recently\ncompleted accrual to the randomised phase III Z1031 trial to\ndetermine whether there are any differences in efficacy between\nthe three approved AIs in this setting (NCT00698971). Preliminary\ndata from this trial indicate that there are no clinically significant\ndifferences between these agents as neoadjuvant treatment\n(Ellis et al , 2010).\nReceived 18 March 2010; revised 24 June 2010; accepted 19 July 2010;\npublished online 10 August 2010\n*Correspondence: Dr CX Ma; E-mail: cma@dom.wustl.edu\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2010) 103, 759 – 764\n& 2010 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved 0007 – 0920/10\nwww.bjcancer.com\nPREOPERATIVE ENDOCRINE THERAPY IN\nPREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN\nIn an early study by Gazet et al (2001), 13 premenopausal women\nwith ER þ breast cancer received neoadjuvant goserelin, a\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. At 3 months,\nseven of the 13 women had an overall response by clinical\nassessment, suggesting that premenopausal women may also\nbenefit from neoadjuvant endocrine manipulation (Gazet et al ,\n2001). Torrisi et al (2007) investigated the use of letrozole and a\nGnRH analogue as primary therapy in premenopausal women with\nER þ breast cancer. These patients received a GnRH analogue for\na median of 5.2 months and letrozole for a median of 4 months. In\nthe 32 evaluable patients, one achieved a pathological complete\nresponse (pCR) and 15 obtained a clinical and imaging partial\nresponse (Torrisi et al , 2007). These studies suggest that\nneoadjuvant endocrine therapy is effective in selected premeno-\npausal women with ER þ breast cancer and further study in this\npatient population is needed.\nCOMPARISON WITH PREOPERATIVE\nCHEMOTHERAPY\nA direct comparison between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and\nendocrine therapy was reported by Semiglazov et al (2007), in\nwhich 239 postmenopausal women with untreated invasive breast\ncancers that were ER and/or progesterone (PgR) positive received\neither combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel\nevery 3 weeks for four cycles ( n ¼118) or AI treatment with\neither exemestane ( n ¼60) or anastrozole ( n ¼61) for 3 months\n(Semiglazov et al, 2007). The clinical overall response, rates of pCR\nand disease progression did not differ significantly among the\ngroups. The breast conservation rate was slightly higher in the\nAI groups at 33% compared with 24% in the chemotherapy arm.\nThese findings support the hypothesis that AI therapy is an\nappropriate low toxicity neoadjuvant approach, but a definitive\nrandomised study that compares neoadjuvant endocrine therapy\nto chemotherapy has yet to be reported. Ideally, a trial that\ncompares the two approaches would take a predictive model\nforward into the clinical trial design, as subpopulations of breast\ncancer may benefit more from chemotherapy, while others from\nendocrine manipulation (van de Vijver et al , 2002; Paik et al , 2004;\nParker et al , 2009).\nMore recently, the GEICAM cooperative group reported a\nrandomised phase II trial of chemotherapy vs exemestane in\npre- and postmenopausal women (Alba et al ,2 0 1 0 ) .N i n e t y - f i v e\npatients with localised ER þ,P g R þ,H E R 2 /C0 and CK8/18 þ\n(immunohistochemistry marker for luminal subtype) breast cancer\nwere randomly assigned to chemotherapy (epirubicin plus cyclo-\nphosphamide every 3 weeks for four cycles followed by docetaxel\nevery 3 weeks for four cycles) ( n ¼47) or exemestane (with\ngoserelin if premenopausal) ( n ¼48). Tumour response was\nmeasured by magnetic resonance imaging. More than 50% of the\nparticipants were premenopausal women ( n ¼24 in the chemo-\ntherapy arm and n ¼27 in the hormonal therapy arm). The\nresponse rate was higher for chemotherapy in the premenopausal\npatients (18 of the 24 in the chemotherapy arm vs 12 of the 27 in the\nhormonal therapy arm, P ¼0.027), but in postmenopausal women\nand those with a low baseline Ki67, responses were comparable. The\nunderperformance of exemestane and goserelin in premenopausal\nwomen may reflect the fact that this can be inadequate for endocrine\ntherapy in some patients, with a failure to suppress ovarian\nfunction. Alternatively, primary endocrine therapy resistance is\nlikely to be higher in a premenopausal population and a more\naccurate predictive model for endocrine therapy efficacy is needed.\nRECEPTOR STATUS AS SELECTION CRITERIA FOR\nNEOADJUVANT ENDOCRINE THERAPY\nOestrogen receptor positivity remains the single most important\ncriterion for eligibility for neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Patients\nwith an ER Allred score of 6 and above are the most likely to\nrespond (Ellis et al, 2001). The data on PgR status does not support\nits use as a selection criterion in the context of ER positivity, and\nPgR þ ER/C0 tumours are too uncommon to make a definitive\nstatement with regard to their management (Ellis et al , 2001).\nHER2 status has been investigated in both the IMPACT and the\nP024 studies. Although the presence of HER2 amplification does not\npreclude a meaningful response to an AI in the neoadjuvant setting\n(Ellis et al , 2001; Smith et al , 2005), HER2 positivity is associated\nwith a lower suppression of Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation,\nin response to either tamoxifen or letrozole (Ellis et al , 2006),\nTable 1 Summary of the letrozole P024, IMPACT and PROACT trials\nLetrozole P024 IMPACT PROACT\nPostmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer\n337 randomised 330 randomised 451 randomised\nPatient characteristics at baseline None were BCS candidates at\nbaseline; 14% deemed inoperable\nPretreatment surgical assessment\navailable for 220 patients – 96 eligible\nfor BCS\n386 of the patients either required\na mastectomy or were deemed\ninoperable at baseline\nDefinition of HR positivity ER/PgR staining 410% ER staining 41% ‘ER+/PgR+’\nNeoadjuvant endocrine therapy L for 4 months\nT for 4 months\nA for 12 weeks\nA+T for 12 weeks\nT for 12 weeks\nA for 3 months\nT for 3 months\nConcomitant chemotherapy?

In\npractice, most patients with HER2 þ tumours receive trastuzumab\nin combination with a chemotherapy regimen because of the high\npCR rate. Although the combination of trastuzumab and an AI has\nshown promising results in patients with metastatic disease (Marcom\net al, 2007; Kaufman et al, 2009), it has not been adequately tested in\nthe neoadjuvant setting.\nPREDICTING LONG-TERM OUTCOMES AFTER\nNEOADJUVANT THERAPY\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy studies have firmly established that\nresponse, and particularly pCR, is a strong predictor of survival in\nbreast cancer patients. However, in the subset of patients with ER þ\nHER2/C0 disease treated with chemotherapy, pCR has limited value,\nas these patients often do well despite the absence of pCR because\nof effective adjuvant endocrine therapy (Buchholz et al , 2001).\nPathological CR is very uncommon in response to neoadjuvant\nendocrine therapy. In three relatively large studies with letrozole,\nthe pCR rate was no more than 1% (Eiermann et al , 2001; Baselga\net al , 2009; Olson et al , 2009). Although residual cancer burden\nafter neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to predict distant\nrelapse-free survival (Symmans et al , 2007), the application of this\nmeasure to patients who underwent neoadjuvant endocrine therapy\nremains to be evaluated. To identify alternative post-treatment\nfactors that predict breast cancer survival after neoadjuvant\nendocrine therapy, Dowsett et al (2007) examined Ki67 expression\nbefore and after 2 weeks of endocrine therapy. Patients with higher\nKi67 expression after 2 weeks of endocrine therapy had a\nsignificantly lower recurrence-free survival (Dowsett et al , 2007).\nIn a multivariable analysis conducted on the P024 trial (Ellis et al ,\n2008a), four factors were determined to have independent\nprognostic value for relapse and death after relapse. These included\npathological tumour size (T1/2 vs T3/4), pathological node status\n(positive or negative) and two biomarkers in the surgical resection\nspecimen, the natural logarithm of the Ki67 value and the ER status\nof the tumour. A prognostic score, the preoperative endocrine\nprognostic index (PEPI), was developed, which weighs each of these\nfactors according to their associated hazard ratios (Table 2). The\nPEPI was then validated in an independent dataset from the\nIMPACT trial (Ellis et al, 2008a). No relapses were recorded in either\ntrial in patients with T1, N0 tumours with a PEPI score of 0 (residual\ntumour with Ki67 index of 2.7% – natural logarithm of 1 – or less\nwith maintained ER expression) or in the rare patient with a pCR.\nThese patients are not likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy\nas endocrine therapy alone appears to adequately control their\ndisease. These results supported an amendment to the Z1031 trial\n(Cohort B), in which chemotherapy was not recommended to\npatients in the pathological stage 1/0 PEPI 0 category. The\nacceptability of this advice will be assessed to see if this approach\ncan be made a protocol mandate in the next phase of clinical trial\ndevelopment. In addition, patients with a high Ki67 proliferation\nindex in a 2- to 4-week biopsy ( 410%) are triaged to neoadjuvant\nchemotherapy or immediate surgery, as these tumours are\nexhibiting primary endocrine therapy resistance (Dowsett et al ,\n2007). To determine the chemotherapy responsiveness of this group,\nthe rate of pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the high on-\ntreatment Ki67 group will be determined (Figure 1). If this approach\nto tailoring neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is feasible, a larger, more\ndefinitive study will be considered.\nGENOMICS TO DETERMINE THE MOLECULAR BASIS\nFOR THE VARIABLE RESPONSE TO ENDOCRINE\nTHERAPY\nDiscovery genomics is a complex process that often requires\nfresh-frozen material, an adequate sample size, patient consent to\ngenetic studies and access to sophisticated analysis techniques. To\ndate, the number of publications on genomic profiling in the context\nof neoadjuvant endocrine therapy remains few and the sample sizes\nare small. For example, Miller et al (2009) reported on a series of 52\npatients, 37 were considered letrozole sensitive and 15 resistant. A\npredictive model was developed that used all three types of gene\nexpression variable: baseline, on-treatment and change in treatment,\nto differentiate between the two groups. This paper illustrates the\nvariety of bioinformatics approaches that can be taken when before\nand on-treatment paired samples are available for analysis (Miller\net al, 2009). Other investigations are ongoing to assess the predictive\nvalue of established molecular signatures, such as the Netherlands\nCancer Institute NKI 70 gene (van de Vijver et al ,2 0 0 2 ) ,2 1g e n e\nrecurrence score (Paik et al , 2004) or the PAM50 (Parker et al ,\n2009), performed on tumour samples taken after the initiation of\nendocrine therapy (Ellis et al , 2008b). The Z1031 trial has recently\ncompleted accrual of 375 patients, despite mandatory fresh tumour\ntissue acquisition, through the provision of tissue acquisition kits\nand the active collaboration of surgical investigators. Z1031 patients\nare also consented for massive parallel DNA sequencing to define\ncomplete cancer genomes (Ding et al , 2010). Very detailed\ninformation on the molecular characteristics of endocrine therapy-\nresistant and -sensitive tumours is therefore a near-term prospect.\nNEOADJUVANT TRIALS TO GENERATE\nPROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE DATA FOR NOVEL\nENDOCRINE THERAPY COMBINATIONS\nThe superior efficacy of adjuvant aromatase inhibition vs\ntamoxifen in reducing the risk of recurrence was mirrored by\nTable 2 The PEPI a\nRFS BCSS\nPathology, biomarker status HR Points HR Points\nTumour size\nT1/2 — 0 — 0\nT3/4 2.8 3 4.4 3\nNode status\nNegative — 0 — 0\nPositive 3.2 3 3.9 3\nKi67 level\n0 – 2.7% (0 – 1\nb)— 0 — 0\n42.7 – 7.3% (1 – 2 b) 1.3 1 1.4 1\n47.3 – 19.7% (2 – 3 b) 1.7 1 2.0 2\n419.7 – 53.1% (3 – 4 b) 2.2 2 2.7 3\n453.1% ( 44b) 2.9 3 3.8 3\nER status, Allred score\n0 – 2 2.8 3 7.0 3\n3–8 — 0 — 0\nAbbreviations: PEPI ¼preoperative endocrine prognostic index; RS ¼relapse-free\nsurvival; BCSS ¼breast cancer-specific survival; HR ¼hazard ratio; ER ¼estrogen\nreceptor. aTo obtain the PEPI score, risk points for RFS and BCSS were assigned\ndepending on the HR defined in the P024 analysis (Ellis et al , 2008a). The total PEPI\nscore assigned to each patient is the sum of the risk points derived from the pT stage,\npN stage, Ki67 level and ER status of the surgical specimen. An HR in the range of\n1 – 2 receives one risk point; an HR in the 2 – 2.5 range, two risk points; an HR greater\nthan 2.5, three risk points. The total risk point score for each patient is the sum of all\nthe risk points accumulated from the four factors in the model. For example, a patient\nwith a T1 N0 tumour, a Ki67 staining percentage of 1% and an ER Allred score of\n6 will have no risk points assigned. In contrast, a patient with a T3 N1 tumour, a Ki67\nstaining percentage of 25% and an ER Allred score of 2 will have a total relapse score\nof 3+3+2+3 ¼11.\nbThe natural logarithm interval corresponding to the per cent Ki67\nvalues on the original percentage scale.\nNeoadjuvant endocrine in primary breast cancer\nYH Chia et al\n761\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2010) 103(6), 759 – 764& 2010 Cancer Research UK\nadvantages for aromatase inhibition as neoadjuvant therapy. This\nwas most consistently seen with letrozole, with both the clinically\nbased (Eiermann et al, 2001) and Ki67-based data (Ellis et al, 2003)\ncorrectly predicting that letrozole would be the more effective\nadjuvant treatment (Thurlimann et al , 2005) several years in\nadvance of the actual result. Anastrozole was also shown to be a\nsuperior antiproliferative agent in comparison with tamoxifen in\nthe neoadjuvant setting, and the failure of the anastrozole/\ntamoxifen combination arm to improve outcomes in the ATAC\ntrial (Howell et al , 2005) was mirrored by the inferior anti-\nproliferative response seen in the combination arm of the IMPACT\ntrial in comparison with anastrozole monotherapy (Dowsett et al ,\n2005). These datasets provide strong arguments for the value of\nneoadjuvant endocrine therapy trials as a ‘proving ground’ to test\nthe efficacy of new endocrine therapy approaches for breast\ncancer. Phase 2 randomised studies of endocrine therapy and\nsignal-transduction inhibitor combinations have been recently\nreported for gefitinib and anastrozole (Polychronis et al , 2005;\nSmith et al , 2007), and the rapamycin analogue, RAD001, with\nletrozole (Baselga et al , 2009). The combination of anastrozole and\ngefitinib was not found to be superior to anastrozole alone. The\ncombination of RAD001 and letrozole showed improved anti-\nproliferative response and clinical response by palpation at the\nexpense of more adverse events. Perhaps, the most convincing\nevidence for progress with a novel endocrine therapy combination\nwould be an enhanced rate of pCR as evidence for the activation of\na cell death process that would more effectively delete ER þ breast\ncancer cells before the acquisition of resistance to endocrine\ntherapy (Crowder et al , 2009) or an increased rate of PEPI score 0\nfollowing neoadjuvant therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS\nNeoadjuvant AI therapy is a clinically valuable, logical and increasingly\naccepted approach to neoadjuvant systemic therapy for postmeno-\npausal women with ERþ HER2/C0 breast cancer. With an array of new\nagents and predictive biomarkers t o investigate, the time for further\nrandomised trials to compare neoad juvant endocrine treatment with\nconventional chemotherapy in a b road spectrum of patients with\nERþ breast cancer has probably pas sed – particularly if the trial\nunder consideration is not prospectively testing a predictive biomarker\nfor endocrine responsiveness. For future investigations, we should also\nfocus on the fact that for ER þ endocrine therapy-resistant disease,\nconventional chemotherapy may not be adequate treatment. We\nshould therefore use the neoadjuvant setting to address two key issues:\nthe development of more effective m echanism-based treatments for\nendocrine therapy-resistant disease; and the identification of ER þ\nbreast cancers that can be mana ged without chemotherapy.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nDr Ellis is supported in this work by Grants R01 CA095614, U01\nCA114722 and P30 CA91842.
