Pax6 is expressed in\nthe central nervous system, the olfactory epithelium, the eye and\nthe pancreas [1]. Heterozygous Pax6 mutations cause the eye\nphenotype aniridia in humans, and is also associated with\nglucose intolerance [2], lack of pineal gland and absence of the\nanterior comissure [3], as well as various neural phenotypes\nassociated with aniridia [4] and references therein). Homozy-\ngous Pax6 mutants have no eyes, nasal structures and pancreas\nin addition to severe brain defects, and die shortly after birth\n[5]. Pax6 has two DNA binding domains: the bipartite paired\ndomain (PD) and the paired type homeodomain (HD) [6]. Both\ncan bind DNA independently, but they can also cooperate. The\nC-terminal part of Pax6 functions as a transcriptional activation\ndomain [7,8]. The Pax6DPD isoform contains only the HD and\ntranscriptional activation d omain (TAD). Moreover, a splice\nvariant of Pax6 which has a 14 amino acid insertion in the N-\nterminal part of the PD gives rise to the Pax6(5a) isoform that\nhas a completely different DNA binding specificity [9]. Isolated\nPax6 DNA binding sites verified by DNA-footprinting are long\n(at least 20–30 bp) and seemingly versatile [10–15]. These sites\nrepresent Pax6 bindingin vivo and can include contribution from\nboth the paired domain and the homeodomain. A PCR based\nbinding site selection method has been used to select the optimal\nbinding sites for both the ordinary Pax6 paired domain [16] and\nthe Pax6(5a) paired domain [9]in vitro.I nt h i sc a s et h es e l e c t e d\nconsensus sequences termed p6CON and 5aCON, were 20 and\n22 bp long, respectively. Whereas p6CON is bound by one\npaired domain, the 5aCON consensus looks like two tandem\nrepeats, and are preferably bound by four Pax6(5a) paired\ndomains simultaneously [9,17]. Importantly, Pax6(5a) is not\nable to bind P6CON sites, but Pax6 can bind 5aCON sites\nalbeit as a monomer, and not as efficiently as Pax6(5a). 5aCON\nhalfsites can be bound by Pax6(5a) monomers, but not by Pax6\nat all [9].\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31915\nThe Pax6(5a) isoform is vertebrate specific [18,19]. However,\nthe eyegone (eyg) and twin-of-eyegone (toe) genes in Drosophila\nare thought to be Pax6(5a) homologues with regard to DNA\nbinding properties since they lack the N-terminal part of the paired\ndomain [20]. Both Pax6 isoforms are expressed together in various\ntissues in the eye and brain, and seem to functionally interact to\nstimulate transcription of target genes [21,22]. In reporter gene\nassays the optimal ratio between Pax6 and Pax6(5a) was shown to\nbe 8:1 or 1:1 [23]. In the early developing mouse brain the Pax6\nand Pax6(5a) transcripts are expressed in a ratio of 8:1 [17,24] but\nfrom E12.5 to E14.4 this ratio falls to 3:1 [24]. A decrease in the\nratio between Pax6 and Pax6(5a) is also observed during chick\nretina development [25]. However in adult human lens and\ncornea, as well as in monkey retina, there seem to be equal levels\nof PAX6 and PAX6(5a) [26]. Even though they are expressed\ntogether, the two Pax6 isoforms have different functions. This is\nillustrated by the fact that mice lacking the Pax6-5a isoform have\nspecific eye defects and also a difference in anatomy of the\npancreas [27]. A missense mutation within Pax6 exon 5a has been\ndescribed in four families with members suffering from Peters\nanomaly, congenital cataracts, Axenfeldt anomaly and/or foveal\nhypoplasia [28]. In line with this, in chicken retina the expression\nof Pax6(5a) is especially high in the fovea [25]. Pax6(5a)\noverexpression in transgenic mice causes cataracts and upregula-\ntion of alpha5-beta1-integrin [29]. Pax6 and Pax6(5a) are both\nreported to be involved in proliferation and differentiation in\nseveral studies, but they seem to play different parts. For example,\nin ovo electroporation of chick retina with either Pax6 or Pax6(5a)\nshowed that both isoforms caused increased retinal cell prolifer-\nation, but Pax6(5a) induced ectopic differentiation of the retina to\na stronger degree than Pax6 [25]. Pax6(5a) was also shown to\nstrongly induce murine embryonic stem cells to differentiate into\nneurons, while Pax6 did not have such a strong effect [30].\nHowever, Haubst and colleagues came to a different conclusion\nwhen they investigated the effects Pax6 mutations in the paired\ndomain (PD), the PD-5a insertion and the homeodomain had on\nbrain development [31]. They showed that Pax6 PD mutations\naffected both proliferation and differentiation, while the PD-5a\nmutation only affected proliferation and had no effect on cell fate/\ndifferentiation in brain development.\nIn the search for novel Pax6 target genes, gene expression\nmicroarrays have been used for both Pax6 overexpressing [21] and\nPax6 heterozygous mutant mouse lenses [32], mouse Pax6\nhomozygous mutant forebrain [33,34] and rat Pax6 homozygous\nmutant hindbrain [35]. There has also been performed a high-\nthroughput screening usingin-situ hybridization to look for genes\nregulated by Pax6 [36].\nNot much is known about Pax6(5a) target genes, and the\nproblem might be in the co-expression with Pax6 making it hard\nto distinguish between combined- and isoform-specific effects on\ngene expression. In this study we constructed Flp-In 3T3 cell lines\nstably expressing either Pax6 or Pax6(5a). 3T3-cells have no\nexpression of the endogenous Pax6 gene locus and the constructed\ncell lines thus express only the stably transfected isoform, either\nPax6 or Pax6(5a). They therefore seem to be ideal to study\nindividual target genes regulated by either Pax6 or Pax6(5a). We\nhave performed a gene expression microarray showing that\nmajority of the regulated genes are associated with the\nextracellular region and include growth factors, growth factor\nreceptors, cell adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix compo-\nnents, secreted inhibitors and peptidases. Interestingly, when\ntarget genes were analyzed with regard to gene ontology, the four\ngroups of Pax6 and Pax6(5a) up- and downregulated genes had\nobvious differences in biological properties. A change in\nmorphology of the Pax6 and Pax6(5a) expressing cells was also\nobserved, as well as an increase in proliferation and migration.\nResults\nConstuction of Flp-In 3T3 cell lines expressing either Pax6\nor Pax6(5a)\nThe two Pax6 isoforms,Pax6 and Pax6(5a), are co-expressed in\nboth the eye and the brain in tissue specific ratios. Searching for\ntarget genes by use of tissues or cell lines from Pax6 mutant\nanimals, or by knocking down Pax6 with siRNA will not\ndistinguish between Pax6 and Pax6(5a) target genes since both\nPax6 isoforms will be affected. It could be that several of the\nidentified Pax6 target genes are common for both isoforms, but\none would expect each isoform to also be able also to regulate\ngenes on their own since their binding site preferences are\ndifferent. In order to identify new Pax6 target genes, and to try to\ndistinguish between genes regulated by Pax6 and Pax6(5a), we\ngenerated FlpIn-3T3 (Invitrogen) cell lines stably expressing the\nmouse Pax6 or Pax6(5a) cDNA. The mouse fibroblast 3T3 cell line\nwas specifically chosen because it does not express any endogenous\nPax6. Successful flip-in and expression of Pax6 and Pax6(5a) were\nshown both by RT-PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 1 A and B).\nFigure 1. RT-PCR and Western blot confirm expression of the\ncorrect Pax6 isoform in the FlpIn-3T3 Pax6 and Pax6(5a) cell\nlines. (A) RT-PCR primers were designed so that the alternatively\nspliced exon 5a (42 bp) would be included in the PCR product if\npresent. HPRT specific primers were used to show equal input of cDNA.\nNeither Pax6 nor Pax6(5a) is present in the FlpIn-3T3 control cell line. (B)\nWestern blot with a Pax6 specific antibody (Millipore # AB2237)\nconfirms expression of Pax6 and Pax6(5a) proteins in the respective cell\nlines. The lower molecular weight band of equal size for each of the\nPax6 cell lines is the Pax6DPD isoform generated from an internal AUG\nstartcodon in the link between the paired domain and the homeodo-\nmain.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0031915.g001\nFinding Pax6 and Pax6(5a) Specific Target Genes\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31915\nGene expression microarray identifies both common and\ndifferent sets of genes regulated by Pax6 and Pax6(5a)\nEight samples of RNA from the three different cell lines were\nsent for microarray analyses on an Illumina Mouse Ref-8 V1.1\nchip (Turku Centre for Biotechnology, Finland). The samples\nincluded three different RNA preparations from two different\npassages for the FlpIn-3T3 (control) and FlpIn- Pax6(5a) cell lines,\nand two different RNA preparations from two different passages\nfor FlpIn-Pax6 cell lines. We found a small but significant number\nof genes to be regulated by the two Pax6 isoforms when comparing\ngene expression in the 3T3-Pax6 and 3T3-Pax6(5a) cell lines to\ngene expression in the 3T3-FlpIn cell line. A total number of 221\ngenes were regulated by Pax6 (130 down and 81 up), whereas\nPax6(5a) regulated a smaller number of genes, totally 82 (52 down\nand 30 up) with a false discovery rate (FDR/p-value) of,0.001\n(Table 1). A Venn diagram (Fig. 2) shows that only 50 genes are\nregulated by both Pax6 and Pax6(5a), whereas Pax6 affects 171\ngenes and Pax6(5a) regulates 32 genes. The full list of genes\nregulated by Pax6 and by Pax6(5a) can be seen in Tables S1 and\nS2, respectively. Already known Pax6 target genes such asNcam1\n[37,38], Vegfa [39], Dkk3 [34] and Crabp1 [34] are on the list of\nregulated genes. Interestingly,Ncam1 which is published as a Pax6\ntarget gene, is only found on the Pax6(5a) list, where it is\nupregulated with a 2.4 fold change.\nGene ontology analysis shows that a majority of the\nregulated genes are associated with the membrane and\nextracellular matrix\nThe gene lists with up- or downregulated genes (threshold 1, see\ntable 1) were analysed by the Database for Annotation,\nVisualisation and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [40,41].\nTo summarize, 25–30% of the genes regulated by both Pax6\nand Pax6(5a) in the 3T3-FlpIn cell line are associated with the\nextracellular region when looking at the term cellular compart-\nment (CC). Furthermore, looking at protein information resource\n(PIR) keywords, ‘‘glycoprotein’’, ‘‘signal’’ and ‘‘secreted’’ are\nassociated with 20–50% of the regulated genes in the Pax6 and\nPax6(5a) cell lines (Table 2). All these observations fit with the\nmolecular function (MF) of regulated genes being associated with\ngrowth factor binding, cytokine binding, carbohydrate binding,\nkinase- and receptor activities and enzymatic activities (Table 3).\nWhen one looks at the biological properties (BP) there are\ninteresting differences between the four groups of genes: those\nassociated with cell growth and adhesion are upregulated by\nPax6, while genes associated with signalling pathways are\ndownregulated. Pax6(5a) upregulated genes are associated with\ncell adhesion, motion and migration, but are also related to\nresponse to starvation and extracellular stimulus. Pax6(5a)\ndownregulated genes are mostly associated with metabolic\nprocesses (Table 4).\nFunctional annotation clustering (which is a function in the\nDAVID database that cluster somewhat heterogeneous, yet\nhighly similar, annotations into functional groups based on the\ndegree of their co-associations with the genes on the users’\nindividual gene lists), confirmed the above observations (data not\nshown). For both Pax6 and Pax6(5a) downregulated genes, the\ncluster giving the highest score contained the term ’’extracellular\nmatrix’’. For Pax6 upregulated genes it was the cluster with the\nterm ‘‘cell adhesion’’ that gave the highest score, while for\nPax6(5a) upregulated genes the cluster with the highest score\ncontained ‘‘disulfide bond’’ and ‘‘signal’’, followed by a cluster\ncontaining the ‘‘cell adhesion’’ term.\nA group of glycosyl transferases are downregulated by\nPax6 and Pax6(5a)\nAn additional gene ontology database (eGOn, http://www.\ngenetools.microarray.ntnu.no/adb/index.php) was also used for\nanalysis [42]. With this tool one can compare lists of genes and\nlook for similarities or differences. We compared the list of\nupregulated genes with the list of downregulated genes for both\nPax6 and Pax6(5a), with the purpose to see if there were\nsignificant differences with regard to molecular function or\nbiological properties in the groups of genes being up- or\ndownregulated. The result showed that a significant group of\ngenes being downregulated by Pax6 and Pax6(5a) is glycosyl\ntransferases, while significantly more genes associated with the\nterm kinase where found in the upregulated gene lists. This would\nimply that changed expression of Pax6 and/or Pax6(5a) could\ncause post-translational differences in both the glycosylation\npattern and phosphorylation status of proteins.

However, Gcnt1 and particularly\nSt3gal6 showed strong downregulation by Pax6 and Pax6(5a)\nrespectively. The high deviation in fold downregulation could be\ncaused by the sensitivity of the qPCR method which enable us to\ndetect very small amounts of transcripts (giving high Ct values,\nwith high deviation). Alternatively, other factors than Pax6(5a)\nmay also influence the expression of St3gal6 contributing to the\nobserved variation in expression levels.\nPax6 and Pax6(5a)specific target genes are verified by\nqPCR\nQuantitative real time PCR primers were designed for some of\nthe genes associated with extracellular matrix (Tgfbi, Vegfa, Adamts-\n2 and Crtap) and cell adhesion (Ctgf, Cdh5 and Ncam). Some genes\nrepresenting the KEGG pathway ‘‘Pathways in cancer’’ (Pdgfra,\nPdgfrb, Vegfa, PPP3ca, EphB2 and Prkcn) and the gene ontology term\n‘‘regulation of transmission of nerve impulses’’ (Bdnf, Ngfb, Klk8 and\nEdn1) were also included (Fig. 4). As well, we performed qPCR on\nsome genes listed as Pax6(5a) specific target genes (Ncam1, Pdgfb,\nNgef, Dkk3, Hist1h1c, Sphk1and Nbl1). When a cut-off of fold change\n(FC) 1.7 was used, most of the genes showed up- or downregu-\nlation as expected from the microarray result. However,Adamts2,\nPdgfra, Ppp3ca and Bdnf did not seem to be regulated at all, and\nPrkcn value was borderline. According to microarray resultsTgfbi,\nVegfa, EphB2, Klk8 were expected to be regulated by Pax6 only,\nand this was confirmed by qPCR. Likewise,Crtap was downreg-\nulated and Ctgf was upregulated as expected by both Pax6 and\nPax6(5a). We noticed thatCrtap is much stronger downregulated\nby Pax6(5a) (74 fold) than by Pax6 (4 fold). Further, for several of\nthe Pax6 specific target genes tested, real time PCR showed\nregulation by the Pax6(5a) isoform as well (e.gEdn1, Ngfb, Cdh5),\neven though the Edn1 gene in particular seemed to be much\nstronger regulated by Pax6 than Pax6(5a) (17 fold compared to 3.7\nfold) (Fig. 4).\nTable 3.Percentage of Pax6/Pax6(5a) up- or downregulated genes associated with various Molecular Function (MF) gene\nontology terms.\nGO-term: MF# Pax6 up GO-term: MF #\nPax6\ndown\nGO-term:\nMF#\nPax6(5a)\nup GO-term: MF\n#\nPax6(5a)\ndown\nInsulin like growth\nfactor binding\n4,20% Growth factor binding 5,60% Growth factor\nactivity\n10,70% Cytokine receptor\nactivity\n6,20%\nGrowth factor binding 4,20% Polysaccharid binding 5,60% Carbohydrate\nbinding\n10,70% Cytokine binding 6,20%\nEnzyme inhibitor activity 5,60% Pattern binding 5,60% Glucoronosyltransferase\nactivity\n4,20%\nSerine type endopeptidase\nactivity\n4,20% Cytokine binding 4,80% Cytoskeletal protein\nbinding\n8,30%\nCytoskeletal protein binding 6,90% Transmembrane receptor\nprotein tyr kinase activity\n4,00% Endopeptidase\nactivity\n8,30%\nEndopeptidase activity 6,90% Vegf receptor activity 2,40%\nGlucosaminoglycan binding 4,80%\nHeparin binding 4,00%\n#According to the Database for Annotation, Visualisation and Integrated Discovery (DAVID).

As the Venn diagram in figure 2 implies, 82\ngenes are indicated as targets for Pax6(5a), with 50 of these also\nbeing regulated by Pax6, leaving 32 as exclusive Pax6(5a) targets\n(Table 5). Quantitative real time PCR was performed with primers\ndesigned for some of the exclusive Pax6(5a) target genes listed in\ntable 5: Ncam1, Pdgfb, Ngef, Dkk3 and Hist1h1c (upregulated) and\nSphk1and Nbl1 (downregulated). The overall result confirmed the\ngene expression microarray data, though there were differences in\nthe fold regulation compared to the microarray. However, most of\nthe genes seemed to be regulated by Pax6 in addition to Pax6(5a),\neven though Pax6(5a) regulation was more prominent (Fig. 5).\nNcam1 has already been identified as a Pax6 target gene [37,38].\nInterestingly, the FlpIn 3T3-Pax6 cell line does not have\nsignificant increase in transcription ofNcam1 compared to control\ncells, while the qPCR results from the Pax6(5a) cell line show that\nit is upregulated 11 fold (Fig. 5). Expression ofNgef is about 12 fold\nupregulated in the Pax6(5a) cell line.Dkk3 is 24 fold upregulated in\nthe Pax6(5a) cell line, and almost 6 fold upregulated in the Pax6\nexpressing cell line.Sphk1 was differentially regulated only in the\nPax6(5a) cell line (about 3 fold down), whileNbl1, which was also\nsupposed to be a Pax6(5a) specific target gene, was almost equally\ndownregulated by Pax6 and Pax6(5a) ( 24.7 and 26.0 fold,\nrespectively, Fig. 5) in the qPCR assay. Of notice, Pdgfb which was\nidentified by the microarray as an exclusive Pax6(5a) target gene,\nshowed only a slight upregulation by Pax6(5a) in qPCR (1.6 fold).\nHowever, Pdgfb turned out to be27.8 fold downregulated in the\n3T3-Pax6 cell line. It is an interesting deviation from the\nmicroarray results which we have no explanation for.\nFigure 3. RT-PCR and real time qPCR with primers specific for seven glycosyl transferases confirms that this group of genes is\ndownregulated by both Pax6 and Pax6(5a).Primers were designed against Ugt1a7, Fut8, Gcnt2, St3gal6, St6gal1, Gcnt1 and Mgat3. All showed\ndownregulation of transcription of these genes in both the Pax6 and the Pax6(5a) cell lines compared to the FlpIn-3T3 control cell line. Pictures are\nrepresentative of three experiments.

Given that the Pax6 consensus sequence is\nquite degenerate to start with, the value of the obtained sites with two\nallowed mismatches is not clear. More attention was paid to the\npossible Pax6(5a) binding sites, since less is known about Pax6(5a)\ntarget genes in the literature. Results for the 5aCON half-sites are\nsummarized in Table S3. For Dkk3 several possible Pax6 sites\n(p6CON) are located in the promoter region, while only one Pax6(5a)\n(5aCON) half-site is located 200 bp downstream of the TSS in exon1.\nThis site is conserved in the humanDKK3 gene as well (data not\nshown). Ncam1 and Ngef, which also are more strongly regulated by\nPax6(5a) than by Pax6, have several 5aCON half-sites located in their\npromoter regions. Ncam1 and Ngef have transcripts starting from\ntwo different regions according to the Ensembl genome database, but\nthe promoter regions of transcripts for both genes (as defined above)\nhave several 5aCON half-sites. For Ngef it is of interest to note that all\nfour 5aCON half-sites are located downstream of the TSS for\ntranscript 202, with three of them clustered around position\n2300 bp. For Ncam the 5aCON half-sites are located both upstream\nand downstream of the TSS. The Ctgf promoter has five 5aCON\nhalf-sites, all upstream of the TSS. No consensus 5aCON half-sites\nwere found for the Sphk1, Vegfa, Pdgfb and Crtap promoters.\nIf Pax6 regulation of the target genes is important one would\nexpect evolutionary conservation of Pax6 binding sites in their\nregulatory regions. We used an area of 5000 bp upstream and\n1000 bp downstream of the TSS of selected target genes to check\nfor conserved sites between mice and humans in rVista. Chicken\nand zebrafish were also included if the corresponding promoter\nareas of the genes were identified. The analyses were done for Dkk3,\nCtgf, Crtap, Pdgfb, Edn1 and St3gal6. We intended to include\nNcam1, Gcnt1 and Gapdh as well, but here the mouse and human\npromoters were not very much conserved to start with, so we did not\ncontinue. The other mouse-human promoter pairs were compara-\nble with at least some degree of conservation, particularly in the area\nof the TSS. rVista uses transcription factor binding sites from the\nTransfac database. Identified Pax6 binding sites conserved between\nmouse and human promoters are shown in table 6. For the 6000 bp\narea covering the TSS there were multiple predicted Pax6 binding\nsites conserved between mouse and human: Ctgf (39), Edn1 (21),\nPdgfb (18), Crtap (8), St3gal6 (8) and Dkk3 (2). Among the 39 Pax6\nbinding sites conserved between mouse and human for the Ctgf\ngene, one was also conserved in chicken, one in zebrafish, and one\nsite was conserved in all four species. Among the 8 Pax6 binding\nsites conserved between human and mouse for the Crtap gene, 4\nwere also conserved in chicken. Thus there seem to exist\nevolutionary conserved Pax6 binding sites in the regulatory regions\nof several of the identified target genes indicating that their\nexpression indeed can be directly regulated by Pax6.\nChIP-PCR verifies binding of Pax6 and Pax6(5a) to the\npromoters of Crtap, Ctgf, Edn1, Pdgfb, Dkk3 and Ngef\nBased on the bioinformatic analyses PCR primers were designed\nfor use in ChIP experiments. Primer sets covered Pax6 and Pax6(5a)\nputative binding sites, and were used for PCR with ChIPed DNA\nfrom both 3T3-Pax6 and 3T3-Pax6(5a) cell lines. Some of the\nprimer sets showed enrichment (binding) in both cell lines,\nindicating that both Pax6 and Pax6(5a) were associated with the\npromoters. This was observed for Crtap, Ctgf, Edn1, and Pdgfb\n(Fig. 6A). As expected, the Ngef promoter fragment containing the\nputative Pax6(5a) binding site was only enriched in immunopre-\ncipitated chromatin from the 3T3-Pax6(5a) cell line (Fig. 6C),\nsupporting our gene expression- and qPCR-results indicating that\nthis is a true Pax6(5a) target gene. Importantly, no amplification was\ndetected with either the Pax6 or Pax6(5a) ChIP extracts with\nprimers directed against the promoter region of the housekeeping\ngene Gapdh which is not expected to bind Pax6 (Fig. 6A). Presence\nof faint bands in the IgG sample for some of the primer sets in\nfigure 6 indicates unspecific binding of chromatin to either IgG or\nthe protein A agarose beads. Since the PCR products of the Pax6\nChIPed samples are much more abundant (observed repeatedly) we\nfeel confident that this area of the promoter is enriched in the Pax6\nChIPed samples. It should be noted that PCRs with two primer sets\nfor Ncam1, one for Vegfa, and a second primer set for Ngef did not\ngive any amplification in ChIPed extracts, indicating that the\nprimers did not cover the Pax6 binding regions of these promoters\n(data not shown).To conclude, binding of Pax6 and/or Pax6(5a) to\nthe promoters of several of the genes differentially expressed\naccording to the gene expression microarray indicates that these are\ndirect target genes of Pax6 and Pax6(5a).\nFigure 5. Real time quantitative PCR shows that Dkk3, Ncam1, Ngef and Sphk1 are strongly regulated by Pax6(5a).Primers were\ndesigned for some of the genes showing differential expression only in the FlpIn-3T3 Pax6(5a) cell line (Dkk3, Hist1h1c, Nbl1, Ncam1, Ngef, Pdgfb,\nSphk1).

In all experiments (n = 4) the 3T3\ncell lines expressing either of isoforms of Pax6 had higher\nproliferation rates compared to the control cells, with 3T3-Pax6\nbeing most prominent. This is shown both by proliferation slope\nanalysis (Fig. 8B) and doubling time calculation (Fig. 8C). Finally,\nwe studied whether serum starved 3T3-Pax6 or 3T3-Pax(5a) cells\nhad altered migration capabilities in presence of a serum attractant\ncompared to the 3T3-control cells. 3T3-control cells were unable\nto migrate through the uncoated xCELLigence CIM-plate\nmembrane in any of the three performed experiments. To\nminimize the possibility that the observed difference in migration\ncould be due to faster proliferating Pax6 cells the experiment was\nlimited to 24 hrs. Furtermore, cells attached to the membrane at\nthe end of the experiment were stained, and confirmed several fold\ndifferences in cell numbers (data not shown), ruling out the\npossibility that the observed changes in impedance were solely\ncaused by adherence differences. Interestingly, Pax6 expressing\ncells did actively pass through the membrane pores following the\nserum gradient, while Pax6(5a) seemed to have very limited\ninfluence on the migration abilities of the 3T3 cells (Fig. 8D).\nDiscussion\nIn this study FlpIn-3T3 cell lines expressing either Pax6 or\nPax6(5a) were generated and used to search for target genes. Gene\nontology analysis of the resulting gene expression microarray\nindicated that a substantial amount of both up- and downregu-\nlated genes was associated with the extracellular region and cell\nmembrane. Regulated genes were also associated with keywords\nsuch as ‘‘glycoprotein’’, ‘‘secreted’’ and ‘‘signal’’. There are\ndifferences in the group of genes regulated by Pax6 and Pax6(5a),\nwith Pax6 upregulated genes being associated with cell growth and\nadhesion, and Pax6(5a) upregulated genes being associated with\ncell motion and migration, as well as response to extracellular\nsignaling and starvation. Downregulated genes were associated\nwith receptor protein signaling pathways for Pax6 and several\nmetabolic processes for Pax6(5a). Selected genes were verified as\ntargets for Pax6 and/or Pax6(5a) by use of qPCR and ChIP. The\npossible biological meaning of these results will be discussed below.\nMost interestingly, several Pax6(5a) specific target genes were\nidentified.\nRelevance of the cell line used\nThere is no endogenous Pax6 expression in the murine 3T3\nfibroblast cell line. The FlpIn-3T3 cells were therefore chosen to\ncreate a Pax6 and a Pax6(5a) cell line to avoid background\nexpression when performing the gene expression microarray. We\nare aware that certain co-factors that co-regulate transcription by\nPax6 might be missing in the 3T3 cell line, and that this most\nprobably influenced the resulting number of differentially\nregulated genes. In addition, since Pax6 and Pax6(5a) also are\nnormally co-expressed, they probably influence the transcriptional\nactivation/repression activity and promoter specificity of each\nother. However, these disadvantages can be overcome in future by\ntransfecting these cell lines with the appropriate co-factors, or the\nmissing Pax6 isoform, to look at the effect this will have on target\ngene expression. The already known Pax6 target genes such as\nNcam1 [37,38], Vegfa [39], Dkk3 [34] and Crabp1 [34] are also\npresent on the list of regulated genes in our experiment. This\nsupports the validity of these cell lines for target genes search, and\nstrengthens our finding of novel Pax6 and Pax6(5a) target genes.\nIt has been reported that Pax6 and Pax6(5a) positively\nautoregulate expression from the endogenous Pax6 promoter in\nNeuro2D and NIH3T3 cell lines [43], but we did not observe this\nthroughout the lengthy study in the FlpIn-3T3 cell lines. The\nFlpIn-3T3 Pax6 cell line never expressedPax6(5a), and the FlpIn-\n3T3 Pax6(5a) cell line did not turn on the endogenousPax6 gene.\nA possible explanation for this could be that the chromatin\npacking in the FlpIn-3T3 cells is such that thePax6 autoregulatory\nbinding sites are not available, or some co-factors are not present\nThe discrepancy between our results and the result of Pinson et al\nFigure 7. The FlpIn-3T3 Pax6 and FlpIn-3T3 Pax6(5a) cell lines have changed morphology compared to the original FlpIn 3T3 cell\nline they were generated from.This was repeatedly observed over several passages. Pax6 and Pax6(5a) expressing cells appeared more flattened\nand seemed to have more protrusions. The cells on the picture have passage numbers 17, 15 and 11 for the FlpIn-3T3, FlpIn-3T3 Pax6 and FlpIn-3T3\nPax6(5a) respectively.

The transfection\nmethods or the insertion sites of the FlpIn cassette could have\nalso contributed to the observed differences.\nExpression of neuron-specific genes upon transduction with\nPax6 has previously been shown in HeLa cells [44]. Similar to our\nobservations in the 3T3 fibroblasts, Cartier and co-workers\nshowed that HeLa cells change morphology and start to migrate\nupon stable transfection with Pax6 [44]. However, although we\nalso observed expression of some genes with known functions in\nneurons (Ngef, Ngfb,Edn1 EphB2, EphB4, Klk8), we did not observe a\npost-mitotic phenotype. On the contrary, Pax6 cells seemed to\nincrease their proliferation rate compared to the control 3T3-\nFlpIn cells. Interestingly, whereas Pax6(5a) also seemed to have a\npositive effect on the proliferation of the FlpIn-3T3 cells, it\nappearently did not increase migration, indicating a functional\ndifference in the genes regulated by Pax6 and Pax6(5a). However,\nthere are no reports on Pax6(5a) being expressed alonein vivo;i ti s\nalways reported to be present in combination with Pax6 in\ndifferent ratios. Since Pax6 and Pax6(5a) obviously have different\nsets of target genes, one might expect that a change in the\nPax6:Pax6(5a) ratio would cause a change in the gene expression\npattern, ultimately changing the cell properties.\nPossible function of Pax6 regulation of target genes\nexpressed in the extracellular region\nIn this study we have shown that stable expression ofPax6 or\nPax6(5a) in a fibroblast cell line causes changes in expression of\ngenes associated with the extracellular region and the membrane.\nThese genes include receptors, adhesion molecules, secreted\ngrowth factors, secreted inhibitory molecules and matrix modify-\ning enzymes. In addition, several glycosyl transferases are\ndownregulated, so the glycosylation pattern on the molecules\nexpressed on the outside of the cells is also expected to be different\ncompared to fibroblasts not expressingPax6. Some of the target\ngenes identified by this approach are already reported to be Pax6\ntarget genes identified in brain, such as Ncam1, Vegfa, Dkk3,\nS100A11 and Crabp1 [34,38,39]. Further, the seemingly high\nproportion of Pax6 regulated genes in the extracellular region in\nthis fibroblast cell line (secreted or associated with the membrane),\nis supported by several lines of evidence in the literature from\nmore biologically relevant cells and tissues. Particularly in the\nbrain, Pax6-positive cells are reported to express specific cell\nsurface molecules or secret specific extracellular matrix compo-\nnents or modifying enzymes. For example, later born cortical\nprecursor cells in homozygousPax6 mutant mouse fail to leave the\nsubventricular zone (SVZ). When transplanted into wild-type\nFigure 8. Pax6 expressing FlpIn-3T3 cells have higher prolif-\neration and higher migration capacity compared to FlpIn-3T3\ncontrol cells and Pax6(5a) expressing cells.Control, Pax6 and\nPax6(5a) cells were seeded in xCELLigence (Roche) proliferation plates,\ncells were left on the bench for 1 hr before the plates were put in the\nxCELLigence machine for measurements for 24 hrs. The measured\nvalues were used to calculate the (A) adhesion slope, (B) proliferation\nslope and (C) doubling time. For adhesion and proliferation slope\nanalyses the mean and standard deviation of three independent\nexperiments are shown. The doubling time analysis shows one\nrepresentative experiment out of three, because absolute values were\nchanging from experiment to experiment probably due to fluctuations\nin cell condition. However, described pattern of increased proliferation\n(Pax6.Pax6(5a).control) was consistent in all experiments. Each\nexperiment was done in triplicates (A–C). xCELLigence migration plates\nwere used to measure the migration, and to calculate the migration\nslope (D). One representative experiment out of 3 is shown.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0031915.g008\nFinding Pax6 and Pax6(5a) Specific Target Genes\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31915\ncortex they migrate and differentiate normally, showing that the\ninability to exit from the SVZ is non-autonomous, and thatPax6 is\nneeded to generate a cortical environment that permits the later\nborn precursors to migrate and differentiate [45]. Similarly,Pax6 is\nexpressed in the anti-hem region shown to be a signaling centre in\nthe brain. In Pax6 knockout mice cells normally found on the\nventral side migrate to the dorsal side, indicating that Pax6\nexpressing cells in the antihem function as a barrier, separating the\ndorsal and ventral telencephalon [46]. Neural crest derived stem\ncells (NCDD) play a crucial role in the development of the front-\nnasal tissue. These cells migrate from the midbrain, but inPax6\nhomozygous mutant embryos they cannot invade the front nasal\nmass [47], due to non cell-autonomous defects in migration. The\nHNK-1 epitope is known to inhibit NCDD migration, and this\nepitope is ectopically expressed in the Pax6 mutant rat facial\nectoderm [48]. It could be thatPax6 expression normally is needed\nto repress the expression of HNK-1 epitope to allow passage of\nNCDDs on their way to the front-nasal area. Pax6 is also shown to\nregulate migration of neuronal precursors in the cerebral cortex,\nand the authors suggested that the primary role of Pax6 during\ncortex development was to regulate cell surface properties\nresponsible for radial migration and cellular identity [49].\nPax6(5a) target genes\nFor this study it was absolutely necessary to have a separate cell\nline for each Pax6 isoform, to be able to distinguish target genes\nthat are specific to, or common for Pax6 and Pax6(5a). We\nidentified 32 exclusive Pax6(5a) target genes in the 3T3-Pax6(5a)\ncell line. Of the ones tested in qPCR, Dkk3, Ngef and Ncam1\nshowed the highest fold upregulation by Pax6(5a) (approximately\n24, 12 and 11 fold, respectively). However, qPCR showed that\nDkk3 and Ngef were also regulated by Pax6, but to a much lesser\nextent – about 2 fold forNgef and 6 fold forDkk3. When analyzing\nthe promoters of these genes (2000 bp upstream and 500–600 bp\ndownstream of the transcriptional start site) in GCG Findpatterns,\nseveral putative Pax6 and Pax6(5a) binding sites were found when\nup to two mismatches compared to the P6CON and 5aCON sites\nwere allowed [9,16]. Interestingly, Dkk3 was the only gene\ncontaining a sequence similar to the tandemly arranged Pax6(5a)\nconsensus site (5aCON, [9]), indicating that binding of four\nPax6(5a) paired domains could be possible also on an in vivo\nregulated target gene.\nDkk3 is a member of the Dickkopf (Dkk) family of secreted\nglycoproteins which is a major class of Wnt signaling regulators,\ntypically antagonizing Wnt/b-catenin signaling (reviewed in [50]).\nWhile Dkk1, Dkk2 and Dkk4 inhibit Wnt signaling by binding to\nLRP5/6 preventing Wnt and Frizzled from forming an active\ncomplex with these receptors, the function of Dkk3 is less clear\n[50,51]. In support of our finding ofDkk3 being upregulated by\nPax6(5a) and Pax6 in the FlpIn-3T3 cell lines, Dkk3 was\ndownregulated inPax6\nSey2/2 cortex compared to wild type mice\nat day E15 in a published gene expression microarray [34].\nInterestingly, with regard to Pax6 role in regulation of the Wnt\nsignaling pathway, Pax6 has recently been shown to be required\nfor downregulation of canonical Wnt signaling in the lens\nectoderm by directly controling the expression of the Wnt\ninhibitors Sfrp1, Sfrp2 and Dkk1 [52].\nA Pax binding site in the neural cell adhesion molecule (Ncam1)\npromoter was identified as far back as in 1994 [53], and Pax6\nbinding to this site was subsequently shown [37]. Recently,\nfunctional assays inXenopus confirmed that Pax6 directly regulates\nNcam expression in retina [38]. These studies all identify Pax6 as\nthe regulator ofNcam expression. Importantly, in our studyNcam\nwas only detected as a target gene in the Pax6(5a) microarray, and\nthis was verified by real time PCR. However, we were not able to\ndetect binding to theNcam1 promoter with two different primer\nsets used in ChIP experiments (data not shown). If Pax6(5a) also\nturns out to be the major activator of Ncam expressionin vivo in\nthe brain and eye, then one would expect the different expression\nratios and expression patterns of Pax6 and Pax6(5a) to have\ndifferent effects on theNcam expression.\nThe neuronal guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( Ngef)i s\nexpressed in certain areas of the brain [54]. Ngef (also called\nephexin) interacts with EphA4 and constitutes a molecular link\nbetween Eph receptors and the cytoskeleton. This upregulates the\nactivity of RhoA and downregulates Cdc42/Rac1 activity, as well\nas induces changes in cell morphology [55]. EphA4 signaling is\nalso important for retinal axon guidance [56]. In our studyNgef\nappears to be a target gene of Pax6(5a) only, being upregulated\nabout 12 fold compared to the control cell line. By ChIP we were\nalso able to detect direct binding of Pax6(5a) to theNgef promoter\nin the 3T3-Pax6(5a) cell line. Interestingly, we identifiedEphB2\nand EphB4 as Pax6 specific target genes, with EphB2 being 2-fold\ndownregulated.by Pax6 and not affected by Pax6(5a) according to\nqPCR results. EphB2 is reported to be involved in differential\ngrowth cone collapse and axon retraction in retinal ganglion cells\n[57].\nSphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) is a lipid kinase, catalyzing the\nphosphorylation of sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate. It is\none of the genes specifically downregulated by Pax6(5a) (about 3\nfold as confirmed by qPCR), but seemingly not affected by Pax6.\nSphk1 is associated with oncogenesis. In addition to promoting\ncellular survival, proliferation and transformation, it prevents\napoptosis and stimulates angiogenesis (reviewed in [58]). It is also\nupregulated in several types of cancer one of them being\nglioblastoma, where an elevated level of Sphk1 is associated with\npoor prognosis [59]. Expression of Pax6 in glioblastoma multi-\nforme (GMB) is associated with good prognosis [60], but in\npublished papers on PAX6 and glioblastoma the authors do not\ndistinguish between the two Pax6 isoforms. It is therefore not\nknown whether Pax6(5a) is expressed in glioblastoma, and in what\nfrequency compared to Pax6. This would be interesting to study\nfurther with regard to the level ofSphk1, since not much is known\nabout the regulation of Sphk1 on the transcriptional level. Even\nthough qPCR confirmed the gene expression microarray results,\nbioinformatic analysis could not detect any 5aCON half-sites in\nthe Sphk1 promoter tested. But sinceSphk1 is registered with 17\ntranscripts having more than 10 different 5 9 starting points\n(Ensembl genome browser), it is possible that we did not analyse\nthe correct Sphk1 promoter region.\nCommon target genes\nNeuroblastoma, suppression of tumorigenecity, ( Nbl1, also\nnamed Dan or NO3) is a member of a class of secreted\nglycoproteins which act as inhibitors of the transforming growth\nfactor beta and bone morphogenic protein pathway. It also acts as\na tumor suppressor, indicated by the fact that human Nbl1 is\nmapped to a region of chromosome 1p often deleted in\nneuroblastomas [61]. Further, overexpression of Nbl1 in trans-\nformed fibroblast cell lines suppressed the transformed phenotype\nand reduced growth rate [62]. In line with this,Nbl1 is found to be\noverexpressed in pancreatic carcinoma [63]. Normal expression\npattern of Nbl1 during embryo development includes the eye, the\near, floor plate of brain, somites and limb buds [64] as well as\nspecific areas in the brain [65]. Even though the microarray result\nindicated Nbl1 to be a Pax6(5a) specific target gene, qPCR showed\nthat Nbl1 transcripts were repressed about 5–6 fold by both Pax6\nand Pax6(5a). Inhibition ofNbl1 in vivo by Pax6/Pax6(5a) would\nFinding Pax6 and Pax6(5a) Specific Target Genes\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31915\nrepress the inhibition of the BMP signaling pathway, keeping it\nactive. Both the BMP and TGF beta signaling pathways are shown\nto be active in and important for some of the tissues where Pax6 is\nexpressed during development (eye and brain) [66,67].\nConnective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) encodes a cystein-rich\nextracellular matrix associated protein, and was one of the genes\nconfirmed by qPCR to be upregulated by both Pax6 (6.8 fold) and\nPax6(5a) (3.8 fold).Ctgf is expressed in a number of different cell\ntypes, but seems to be particularly important for normal\ndevelopment of the skeleton sinceCtgf null mice showed significant\nskeletal defects [68]. Ctgf is a major contributor of fibrotic diseases\n[69]. These properties do not immediately seem to be connected\nto Pax6. However, Pax6 is involved in corneal wound healing\n[70,71], and, interestingly, Ctgf is also shown to play a role in this\nprocess, where it enhances attachment and migration [72].\nExpression of Ctgf is reported to be influenced by cell shape\naltering stimuli (reviewed in [73]). By the use of ChIP we showed\ndirect binding of Pax6 and Pax6(5a) to theCtgf promoter.\nGlycosyl transferases\nWe have verified that seven glycosyl transferases are downreg-\nulated by Pax6 and Pax6(5a) in the 3T3 cells. It is believed that\n50% of all proteins are glycosylated, especially proteins expressed\non the cell surface or in the extracellular region. Changes in\nglycosylation pattern are often observed in various diseases and in\ncancer (reviewed in [74]). Some of the glycosyl transferases\nidentified in our study ( Fut8, Mgat3, St6gal1) modify core\nglycosylation structures on receptors and extracellular matrix\nmolecules [75,76]. In general, glycosylation is shown to play a role\nin intra- and intercellular trafficking, molecular and cellular matrix\ninteractions, initiation of signal transduction and in the regulation\nof processes such as cell growth, migration, differentiation and\ntumor invasion [74,76] Interestingly, Gcnt2 is associated with\ncataracts – a well known feature of mutant Pax6 phenotype [77].\nAlready in 1974 it was suggested that the mutant gene in small-eye\nmice could be involved in synthesis or processing of glycoproteins,\nsince multiple glycoconjugate abnormalities were identified in\nmutant eyes [78]. Kucerova and colleagues have now shown that\nthere are indeed alterations in the glycoconjugate signature of the\nPax6 mutant cells, and that these alterations restrict the ability of\nthe corneal epithelial cells to initiate migration in response to\nwounding [79].\nTo conclude, we have generated FlpIn-3T3 cell lines expressing\nonly the Pax6 or Pax6(5a) isoform and this approach enabled us to\nidentify target genes specific for each of them. It also showed that\nseveral genes are regulated by both of the two Pax6 isoforms\nindependently. These are important observations since in most\ncells the two Pax6 isoforms are expressed together in specific\nstochiometric relationships that may change over time during\ndevelopment of some tissues. Future studies will be needed to show\nif they synergistically activate the common target gene promoters.\nIdentification of already known Pax6 target genes and observation\nof a link between identified target genes and known Pax6\nassociated biological processes indicate that the target genes found\nin these 3T3 cell lines are highly relevant and can contribute to the\nunderstanding of Pax6 and Pax6(5a) roles in normal development\nand cancer.\nMaterials and Methods\nConstruction and maintenance of the FlpIn-3T3 Pax6 and\nPax6(5a) cell lines\nFlpIn-3T3 cell lines (Invitrogen, R761-07) were grown in\nDMEM high glucose supplemented with penicilin, streptomycin\nand 10% fetal calf serum. Zeozin (100mg/ml) was added for the\nFlpIn-3T3 cells, while the FlpIn-3T3 cells constructed to express\nPax6 or Pax6/5a) were grown with hygromycin (150mg/ml). Full\nlength mouse cDNA clones of mPax6 and mPax6(5a) in the\npENRTR1A vector were used as a starting point to clonemPax6\nand mPax6(5a) into the pEF5/FRT/V5-DEST expression vector\nwith the Gateway Technology (Invitrogen). Lipofectamine and\nPlus reagent (Invitrogen) were used for transfecting the Flp-In 3T3\ncells according to the manufacturers recommendations. A ratio of\n9:1 between pOG44 (Invitrogen) and the Pax6 or Pax6(5a)\nexpression plasmid was used in the co-transfection. Transfections\nwere done in 10 cm dishes, and transfection media (without\nantibiotics and serum) was replaced with media with penicillin,\nstreptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum after 3 hours. Media\ncontaining hygromycin (150\nmg/ml) was added after 20 hrs to\nselect for stable transfectants. After 3–4 passages expression of\nPax6 and Pax6(5a) was confirmed by both RT-PCR and Western\nblot.\nGene expression microarray\nRNA was extracted from cells by use of Trizol according to the\nmanufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen). Three individual RNA\npreparations from two different cell passage numbers were used\nfor the FlpIn-3T3 control cell line and for the FlpIn-3T3 Pax6(5a)\ncell line, while RNA from two different passage numbers were\nprepared from the FlpIn-3T3 Pax6 cell line. The RNA was\nshipped to the Turku Centre for Biotechnology (University of\nTurku, Finland) where the sample quality was validated before the\nsamples were processed and used in microarray on a Illumina\nMouse Ref-8 V1.1 chip (project 070078). In total 24613 transcripts\nwere on the chip. The data was normalized using the Quantile\nnormalization method, and the R package Limma was used for\nperforming the comparisons between the groups (done by the\nTurku Centre for Biotechnology). Two sets of thresholds were\nused for filtering. List of genes obtained by threshold 1 had a false\ndiscovery rate (FDR) p-value of 0.001, a cut off for fold change\n(FC) at 1.7 and the logFC at 0.77. For threshold 2, (FDR) p-value\nwas set to 0.01, FC 1.5 and logFC 0.58. The data have been\nsubmitted to the GEO repository (accession number GSE31402).\nWestern Blot\nCell lysates were incubated with sample buffer for 5 minutes at\n100uC and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel (Mighty Small,\nInvitrogen). Blotting was performed onto a Hybond nitrocellulose\nmembrane (GE Healthcare) using the Mighty Small blotting\nsystem (Invitrogen). The membrane was incubated with blocking\nbuffer (PBS buffer/0.1% Tween-20/5% non-fat dried milk).\nPrimary and secondary antibodies were diluted in the blocking\nbuffer.

Volume of cDNA input was adjusted\nbefore gene specific primers were used (Pax6, Gcnt1, Gcnt2,\nSt3gal6, St6gal1, Fut8, Mgat3, Ugt1a7c), see Table S3.

Reverse transcription of total RNA was\nperformed using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase kit\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s\nrecommendations using 150 ng random hexamer primers (Fer-\nmentas International Inc., Canada). dNTP mix was purchased\nfrom Promega (Madison, WI). 500 ng total RNA was used per\n20 ml cDNA reaction.\nFor quantification of mRNA expression levels, a Stratagene\nMX3000P instrument (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used. Primer\npairs were designed using Primer 3 software (Whitehead Institute,\nCambrigde, MA) [80] and synthesized by Invitrogen (Table S4).\nPrimers for one of the housekeeping genes (mTfrc) were purchased\ndirectly from Qiagen (Quantitect primer assay, QT00122745). So\nwere primers for mTgfbi (Quantitect primer assay, QT00105770).\ncDNA corresponding to 25 ng RNA was amplified for 40 cycles\nin a 25ml SYBR green PCR mix (Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR\nmaster mix, Stratagene) containing 200 nM of each primer.\nCycling conditions were 95uC for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at\n95uC for 30 sec, 60uC for 1 min and 72uC for 30 sec. A SYBR\ngreen melting curve analysis was included to determine primer\nspecificities and confirm the absence of primer dimers.\nDuplicate PCR analyses were performed on each cDNA\nsample. The absence of genomic DNA and contaminations were\nconfirmed by the inclusion of no reverse transcriptase (No RT)\ncontrols and no template controls (NTCs) respectively. The\nrelative amount of target gene normalized to the average\nexpression of the two reference genes Tfrc and Nono was\ndetermined using theDDCq-method [81].\nChIP\nCells of 70–80% confluence were crosslinked in freshly prepared\n1% formaldehyde for 7 minutes at room temperature. The\ncrosslinking was stopped by adding 0.125 M glycine. Cells were\nharvested in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris\n(pH 8,0), 10 mM EDTA and protease inhibitor cocktail\n(cat#11836153001, Roche, Germany).

For immunoprecipitation we\nused 1.0 mg of either of the following antibodies: human IgG\n(Abcam, UK, cat #AB46540-1) or anti-Pax6 (Millipore, USA,\ncat#AB2237). Protein A-agarose beads were purchased from\nSanta Cruz, USA (cat#sc-2001), pre-blocked with a mixture of\n1% BSA and sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Agilent Technologies,\nUSA, cat#201190). After IP beads were washed 4 times. Reversal\nof cross-links and elution of PCR-ready DNA were identically\nperformed on immunoprecipitated DNA-protein complexes and\ninput chromatin samples essentially as described (Nelson 2006).\nChelex-100 beads were purchased from BioRad, USA (cat#142-\n1253) and proteinase K from Invitrogen, USA (cat#25530-015).\nFor PCR-based verification ofin vivo binding, we used a ready-\nmade DyNAzyme II PCR Master Mix (Finnzymes/Thermo\nFisher, USA, cat#F508). Each PCR reaction had a total volume\nof 25 ml with 2,0ml template. Sequences of primers designed by\nPrimer3 software are shown in Table S4.\nProliferation assay\n3T3 cells (control, Pax6, Pax6(5a)) were trypsinised briefly until\ndetached. Cells were resuspended in complete growth media and\ncounted. Optimal cell number per well (5000) was determined in\ninitial titration experiments. According to xCELLigence (Roche)\nmanufacturer’s instructions, cells were seeded in duplicates into E-\nplates 16 (Roche, cat# 05469830001) after baseline measurement.\nPlates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and\nthen placed into the RTCA DP instrument (Roche, cat #\n05469759001) located in an incubator preserving same temper-\nature and CO2 concentration as were used for routine cultivation\nof 3T3 cells. Cell index (arbitrary unit reflecting the cell-sensor\nimpedance) was measured every 15 minutes during the first\n4 hours for better resolution at attachment and spreading phase.\nFurther measurements were taken every 30 minutes. Slope and\ndoubling time calculations were performed with RTCA software\n1.2 (Roche). Four independent experiments were performed.\nMigration assay\nCells were serum-starved for 24 hours, trypsinised briefly until\ndetached, then immediately resuspended in serum-free growth\nmedia. After centrifugation media was removed, pellets resus-\npended in serum-free media and cell numbers counted. Optimal\ncell number per well (20000) was determined in an initial titration\nexperiment. According to xCELLigence manufacturer’s instruc-\ntions, cells were seeded in duplicates into uncoated CIM-plates 16\n(Roche, cat# 05665817001) after baseline measurement. Media\nbelow membrane contained 10% of freshly thawn fetal calf serum.\nPlates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before\nstarting the routine measurements. Cell index was measured every\n15 minutes during 24 hours (duration of the experiment was\nlimited based on manufacturer’s advice to prevent errors caused\nby proliferation of the cells on the outer side of the membrane).\nSlopes were calculated with RTCA software 1.2. Three indepen-\ndent experiments were performed.\nBioinformatic analyses\nFor Gene ontology analyses the Database for Annotation,\nVisualisation and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [40,41] was\nused. We used the lists of up- or downregulated genes (threshold 1)\nas inputs. A list of all genes on the Illumina Mouse Ref-8 V1.1 chip\nwas provided as reference (background). The eGOn database\n(http://www.genetools.microarray.ntnu.no/adb/index.php) [42]\nwas used to compare the list (both threshold 1 and threshold 2)\nof upregulated genes with the list of downregulated genes.\nFor Pax6 binding site analyses ConSite [82] was used to look for\nPax6 and Bsap (Pax5) binding sites. The Bsap bs was included\nbecause Pax5 and Pax6 have similar DNA binding preferences [6].\nConSite does not have the Pax6(5a) bs as an option. To look for\nPax6(5a) binding sites in selected target gene promoters, the\n5aCON halfsite (ATGYTCAKTGA) [9] was used in the Genetics\nComputer Group (GCG) package with thefindpatterns option, with\nallowed mismatch set to 2. Similar GCG analyses were also done\nFinding Pax6 and Pax6(5a) Specific Target Genes\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 14 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31915\nwith the the P6CON site (ANNTTCACGCWTSANTTKMNY)\n[16] and the Pax6 consensus site (RNGMANTSAWGCGTRAA)\n[6] The input to the ConSite and GCG analyses were promoters\nof selected target genes, identified by use of the Ensembl genome\nbrowser by including 2000 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream\nof the transcriptional start site (TSS) in exon 1 of the gene of\ninterest. The identities of the transcript (and thus the regulatory\nregions) used for these analyses are given in table 6 and Table S3.\nFor extended promoter analyses and comparison of evolution-\nary conserved sites, promoter areas 5000 bp upstream and\n1000 bp downstream of the TSS of exon 1 (Ensembl) of selected\ntarget genes were used. The region corresponding to the promoter\nof the orthologous human gene/transcript was included. Some of\nthe genes chosen for analyses had several transcripts and several\ndifferent first exons. The NCBI browser (align 2 sequences option)\nwas used to align the mouse and human sequences so that the\ncorrect/comparable promoters were used for downstream analy-\nses. If found, the orthologous chicken and zebrafish promoters\nwere also included. Location of these promoter regions in the\ngenome is specified in table 6. The promoter sequences were\nanalysed by use of rVISTA [83] for evolutionary conserved Pax6\nbinding sites.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Pax6 regulated genes (threshold 1).\n(XLS)\nTable S2 Pax6(5a) regulated genes (threshold 1).\n(XLS)\nTable S3 Pax6(5a) consensus binding sites.\n(EPS)\nTable S4 Primer sets.\n(XLS)\nAcknowledgments\nWe are thankful to Meinrad Busslinger for providing the full length mPax6\nand mPax6(5a) cDNA clones, and to Ole Morten Seternes for critical\nreading of the manuscript.
