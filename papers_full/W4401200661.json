    "abstract": "Abstract Metabolic processes can transform a drug into metabolites with different properties that may affect its efficacy and safety. Therefore, investigation of the metabolic fate of a drug candidate is of great significance for drug discovery. Computational methods have been developed to predict drug metabolites, but most of them suffer from two main obstacles: the lack of model generalization due to restrictions on metabolic transformation rules or specific enzyme families, and high rate of false-positive predictions. Here, we presented MetaPredictor, a rule-free, end-to-end and prompt-based method to predict possible human metabolites of small molecules including drugs as a sequence translation problem. We innovatively introduced prompt engineering into deep language models to enrich domain knowledge and guide decision-making. The results showed that using prompts that specify the sites of metabolism (SoMs) can steer the model to propose more accurate metabolite predictions, achieving a 30.4% increase in recall and a 16.8% reduction in false positives over the baseline model. The transfer learning strategy was also utilized to tackle the limited availability of metabolic data. For the adaptation to automatic or non-expert prediction, MetaPredictor was designed as a two-stage schema consisting of automatic identification of SoMs followed by metabolite prediction. Compared to four available drug metabolite prediction tools, our method showed comparable performance on the major enzyme families and better generalization that could additionally identify metabolites catalyzed by less common enzymes. The results indicated that MetaPredictor could provide a more comprehensive and accurate prediction of drug metabolism through the effective combination of transfer learning and prompt-based learning strategies.",
