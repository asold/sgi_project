    "abstract": "We report an observation of a wild New Caledonian Crow Corvus moneduloides manufacturing two tools from dry grass stems, and using them to extract lizards from the crevices of a fencepost. We recovered one of the tools and were able to examine the raw material from which tools had been manufactured. This confirms our earlier observations with animal-borne video cameras, where we inferred use of this hitherto undocumented tool material from frame-by-frame analysis of video footage.",
