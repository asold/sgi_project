    "abstract": "This article investigates the potential of Large Language Model (LLM) tools like ChatGPT in aiding researchers in the development and refinement of interview protocols. We found that ChatGPT could generate appropriate interview questions, craft key questions, provide feedback on protocols, and simulate interviews, indicating its potential to reduce time and effort, particularly when human resources are limited. This article builds upon previous authors’ insights and suggestions regarding developing and refining interview protocols to maximize the chances of achieving research aims, especially for novice researchers. Additionally, the researchers highlight the flexibility of these tools in adapting to different research contexts and cultural considerations. Ethical considerations and human oversight are emphasized as critical components in the responsible implementation of these tools. The research also paves the way for further exploration into the integration of LLMs into other aspects of research processes and offers suggestions for the use of LLMs in interview protocol development and refinement. The findings encourage a broader discussion on the evolving role of technology in academic research and present an exciting avenue for future studies in hybrid human-AI engagements in scholarly pursuits.",
