The cost of genome sequencing has substantially\ndropped over the last decade and repositories now encompass an incredible amount of geno-\nmic data, which has opened avenues for the emerging field of ecological genomics. However,\nwhen working at the population level— at least in eukaryotes— sequencing whole genomes still\nlies beyond the capacities of most laboratories, and a number of techniques targeting a subset\nof the genome have been developed [2, 3]. Among the most popular are approaches relying on\nhybridization capture of exome [4] or conserved fragments of the genome [5], RNA sequencing\n(RNAseq [6]), and Restriction-Associated-DNA sequencing (RADseq [7, 8]). The latter has\nbeen developed in many different versions, but generally relies on specific enzymatic digestion\nand further selection of a range of DNA fragment sizes. RAD-sequencing has proved to be a\ncost- and time-effective method of SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) discovery, and cur-\nrently represents the best tool available to tackle questions in the field of molecular ecology.\nThe wide utility of RAD-sequencing in ecological, phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies is\nhowever limited by two main factors: i) the quality of the starting genomic DNA; ii) the degree\nof divergence among the studied specimens, that translates into DNA sequence polymorphism\nat the restriction sites targeted by the RAD protocols.\nSequence polymorphism at the DNA restriction site causes a progressive loss of shared\nrestriction sites among diverging clades and results in null alleles for which sequence data can-\nnot be obtained. This limitation critically reduces the number of orthologous loci that can be\nsurveyed across the complete set of analyzed specimens and leads to biased genetic diversity\nestimates [9–11]. This phenomenon, combined with other technical issues–such as polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) competition effects–is a serious limitation of most classic RAD-sequenc-\ning protocols that needs to be addressed.\nIn addition, RAD-sequencing protocols rely on relatively high molecular weight DNA\n(especially for the ddRAD protocol [12]), notably because enzyme digestion and size selection\nof resulting fragments are the key steps for retrieving sequence data across orthologous loci.\nTherefore, RAD-sequencing cannot be applied to degraded DNA samples, a limitation also\nshared by classical genotyping methods and amplicon sequencing. Museum collections,\nalthough encompassing samples covering large spatial areas and broad temporal scales, have\nnot necessarily ensured optimal conditions for DNA preservation. As a result, many museum\nspecimens yield highly fragmented DNA–even for relatively recently collected samples [13–\n15], limiting their use for molecular ecology, conservation genetics, phylogeographic and phy-\nlogenetic studies [16, 17]. A cost-effective and widely applied approach for genomic analyses\non museum specimens would allow exploring often unique biological collections, e.g., encom-\npassing rare or now extinct taxa/lineages or organisms occurring ephemerally in natural habi-\ntats and posing problems for sampling. It would also allow studying temporal shifts in genetic\ndiversity using historical collections, now applied only in a handful of cases at a genomic scale\n[18].\nHybridization-capture methods have been acknowledged as a promising way to address\nboth the allele representation and DNA quality limitations [19, 20]. Such approaches however\nusually rely on prior genome/transcriptome knowledge and until recently have been largely\nconfined to model organisms. Addressing this limitation, the recent development of UltraCon-\nserved Elements (UCE [3, 5]) or anchored hybrid enrichment [21] capture-based methods\nallowed targeting homologous loci at broad phylogenetic scales using one set of probes. It how-\never requires a time-consuming design and costly synthesis of the probes for capturing the\nDNA sequences of interest. Similarly, exon capture techniques, recently applied in the field of\nHybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD)\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651 March 21, 2016 2/2 2\nThe funders had no role in study design, data\ncollection and analysis, decision to publish, or\npreparation of the manuscript. The specific roles of\nthese authors are articulated in the‘author\ncontributions’ section.\nCompeting Interests:AK is a founder of the\ninsidedna.me platform (InsideDNA Ltd) used for\nanalyzing the datasets. This does not alter the\nauthors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing\ndata and materials. The other authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nmuseum genomics [18], require fresh specimens for RNA extraction or synthesizing the probes\nbased on the known transcriptome.\nHere, we present an approach we called‘hybridization RAD’(hyRAD), in which DNA frag-\nments, generated using double digestion RAD protocol (ddRAD [8]) applied to fresh samples,\nare used as hybridization-capture probes to enrich shotgun libraries in the fragments of inter-\nest. Our method thus combines the simplicity and relatively low cost of developing RAD-\nsequencing libraries with the power and accuracy of hybridization-capture methods. This\nenables the effective use of low quality DNA and limits the problems caused by sequence poly-\nmorphisms at the restriction site. Moreover, utilizing standard ddRAD and shotgun sequenc-\ning protocols allows application of the hyRAD protocol in laboratories already utilizing the\nabovementioned methods, for little cost.\nIn short, the hyRAD approach consists of the following steps (Fig 1):\n1. generation of a ddRAD library based on high-quality DNA samples, narrow size selection of\nthe resulting fragments and removing adapter sequences;\nFig 1. Lab-work procedure used for hyRAD development.Homologous reads from shotgun genomic libraries are captured through hybridization on\nrandom RAD-based probes. These fragments are then separated using streptavidin-coated beads and sequenced.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651.g001\nHybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD)\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651 March 21, 2016 3/2 2\n2. biotinylation of the resulting fragments, hereafter called the probes;\n3. construction of a shotgun sequencing library from DNA samples (either fresh or degraded\nas in museum specimens);\n4. hybridization capture of the resulting shotgun libraries on the probes;\n5. sequencing of enriched shotgun libraries and optionally of the ddRAD library (probes pre-\ncursor) for further use as a reference;\n6. bioinformatic treatment (Fig 2): assembly of the reads into contigs, alignment to the\nsequenced ddRAD library orde novoassembly, SNP calling.\nIn this paper, we describe the laboratory and bioinformatic pipelines for obtaining hyRAD\ndata, as well as validate the usefulness of the method on two empirical datasets. We first test\nthe method on the DNA obtained from museum and fresh specimens ofLycaena hellebutter-\nflies. We explore different bioinformatic approaches for assembling loci out of the hybridiza-\ntion-capture libraries, namely: i) mapping captured libraries on previously sequenced RAD loci\nfrom fresh samples; ii) using RAD loci as seeds and the captured libraries’reads to extend the\nRAD loci in order to obtain longer loci for mapping; iii)de novoassembly of the captured\nFig 2. Bioinformatic pipeline used for processing hyRAD sequences.First, the reads are demultiplexed and cleaned. Different types of references were\nbuilt and the captured fragments were mapped on the reference. The SNPs are then called after correcting for post-mortem DNA damages.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651.g002\nHybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD)\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651 March 21, 2016 4/2 2\nreads from a single, well-preserved butterfly specimen for the reference. Secondly, as a proof of\nconcept, we apply the protocol to museum and fresh samples ofOedaleus decorus, a Palearctic\ngrasshopper species for which a marked east-west spatial genetic structure has been identified\nin a previous study [22].\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy species and study design\nFor the first step of the method development, we used samples of the butterflyLycaena helle\n(Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae) (Table 1). Three recently collected, ethanol-preserved samples from\nRomania, France and Kazakhstan were used for generating the RAD probes, in order to cover\nvariation within the full species range. Genomic libraries to be enriched by sequence capture\nwere built using eight samples which included seven museum dry-pinned specimens from Fin-\nland (4 collected in 1985 and 3 collected in 1957) and one recently collected and ethanol-pre-\nserved specimen from Romania. Using these eight samples we compared the outputs between\nfresh and historical DNA of different age, and tested the importance of DNA sonication in\neach case. The museum samples were loaned from the Finnish Museum of Natural History in\nHelsinki, and the ethanol-preserved samples were obtained from Roger Vila’s Butterfly Diver-\nsity and Evolution lab (Institute of Evolutionary Biology, CSIC, Barcelona, Spain).\nFor the method validation, we used 53 samples of the grasshopperOedaleus decorus, includ-\ning 49 samples of both fresh and museum collection specimens for constructing genomic\nlibraries for the capture (seeTable 2), and four fresh specimens spanning the species’distribu-\ntion (Switzerland, Spain, Hungary, Russia) for generating the RAD probes. The museum sam-\nples were on average 64-years-old, with the oldest sample dating back to 1908 and were\nprovided by the National History Museum of London (UK), the Natural History Museum of\nBern (Switzerland), the Zoological Museum of Lausanne (Switzerland), the ETH Entomologi-\ncal Collection (Switzerland), the Natural History Museum of Basel (Switzerland), the Natural\nHistory Museum of Geneva (Switzerland), and the Natural History Museum of Zurich (Swit-\nzerland). The four fresh grasshopper samples were provided by G. Heckel (University of Bern).\nTable 2.

As museum specimens are usually\ncharacterized by low-content of degraded DNA, the isolation protocol was optimized accord-\ningly. The samples were extracted using QIAamp DNA Micro kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon,\nSwitzerland) in a laboratory dedicated to low-DNA content samples at the University of Lau-\nsanne, Switzerland. For these samples, DNA recovery was improved by prolonged sample\ngrinding, overnight incubation in the lysis buffer for 14h and final DNA elution in 20μl of the\nbuffer with gradual column centrifugation. Extraction of fresh samples was performed using\nDNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). DNA extraction and library preparation using museum\nspecimens was performed using consumables dedicated to the museum specimens only.\nBenches were thoroughly cleaned with bleach and filter tips were used at all stages of lab work.\nRAD probes preparation\nThe probe precursors were prepared using a double-digestion RAD protocol [8, 23], with fur-\nther modifications.\nTotal genomic DNA was digested at 37°C for 3 hours in a 9μl reaction, containing 6μlo fD N A ,\n1x CutSmart buffer (New England Biololabs— NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA), 1 U MseI (NEB) and 2 U\nof SbfI-HF (NEB). The reaction products were purified using AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Brea,\nUSA), with a ratio of 2:1 with the sample, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and resus-\npended in 10μl of 10 mM Tris buffer. Subsequently, adapters were ligated to the purified restric-\ntion-digested DNA in a 20μl reaction containing 10μl of the insert, 0.5μMo fR A D - P 1a d a p t e r ,\n0.5 μM of universal RAD-P2 adapter, 1x T4 ligase buffer, and 400 U of T4 DNA ligase (NEB).\nAdapter sequences are shown inTable 3; single strand adapter oligonucleotides are annealed before\nuse by heating to 95°C and gradual cooling. Ligation was performed at 16°C for 3 hours. The reac-\ntion products were purified using an AMPure XP ratio 1:1 with the sample, and resuspended in 10\nmM Tris buffer. The ligation product was size-selected using the Pippin Prep electrophoresis plat-\nform (Sage Science, Beverly, USA) with a peak at 270 bp and‘tight’size selection range.\nThe resulting template was amplified by PCR in a 10μl mix consisting of 1x Q5 buffer, 0.2\nmM of each dNTP, 0.6μM of each primer (Table 3), and 0.2 U Q5 hot-start polymerase\n(NEB). The thermocycler program included initial denaturation for 30 sec at 98°C; 30 PCR\ncycles of 20 sec at 98°C, 30 sec at 60°C, and 40 sec at 72°C; followed by a final extension for 10\nmin at 72°C. In order to obtain sufficient amount of material for the probes, the reaction had\nto be run in replicates. The necessary number of replicates has to be determined empirically to\nreach in total 500–1000 ng of the amplified product required for each capture. DNA amounts\nwere assessed using a Qubit fluorometer (Waltham, MA, USA). Success of size selection and of\nPCR reactions was confirmed by running them on a Fragment Analyzer (seeS1 Fig; Advanced\nAnalytical, Ankeny, IA, USA; seeS1 Fig). Afterwards, the PCR products were pooled and puri-\nfied using AMPure XP, with a ratio of 1:1 with the amplified DNA volume.\nAn aliquot of the resulting library was sequenced and the rest of the library was converted\ninto probes by removing adapter sequences by enzymatic restriction followed by biotinylation.\nThe probe precursors were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours in a 50μl reaction containing 30μlo f\nDNA, 1x CutSmart buffer (NEB), 5 U of MseI (NEB) and 10 U of SbfI-HF (NEB), replicated as\nrequired by the amount of the amplified product. The reaction was ended with 20 min enzyme\ninactivation at 65°C for 20 min and the resulting fragments were purified using AMPure XP:\nreaction volume ratio of 1.5:1. Purified fragments were biotin nick-labelled using BioNick\nDNA Labeling System (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the supplier’s\ninstructions and purified using AMPure XP:reaction volume ratio of 1.5:1. The resulting frag-\nments will thereafter be referred to as probes.\nHybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD)\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651 March 21, 2016 6/2 2\nShotgun library preparation\nShotgun libraries were prepared from the fresh and museum specimens based on a published\nprotocol for degraded DNA samples [15], modified in order to incorporate adapter design of\nMeyer & Kircher [24]. The approach used for library preparation, utilizing barcoded P1\nadapter and 12 indexed P2 PCR primers, allows a high sample multiplexing on a single\nsequencing lane (seeTable 3[24]).\nFor L. helle, DNA from each individual was divided in two aliquots. One aliquot was kept\nintact (i.e. high molecular weight DNA in the fresh sample and naturally degraded DNA in\nmuseum specimens) and the second was sonicated using Covaris focused ultrasonicator\n(Woburn, MA, USA) with a peak at 300 bp. Both aliquots were processed in parallel during\nsubsequent steps of libraries preparation. All the libraries fromO. decorus were prepared with-\nout sonication, based on the test results obtained from theL. helle libraries.\nDNA samples were first 5’-phosphorylated in order to allow adapter ligation in the next\nsteps of the protocol. 8μl of DNA was denatured at 95°C for 10 minutes and quickly chilled on\nice. The 10μl reaction consisting of denatured DNA, 1x PNK buffer and 10U of T4 polynucleo-\ntide kinase (NEB) was incubated at 37°C for 30min and heat-inactivated at 65°C for 20 min.\nTable 3.

The reaction composed of 1x buffer 4\n(NEB), 0.25 mM cobalt chloride (NEB), 4 mM GTP (Life Technologies), 10 U TdT (NEB) and\n10 μl of denatured DNA in 20μl reaction volume was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and heat-\ninactivated at 70°C for 10 min.\nThe second DNA strand was synthesized using Klenow Fragment (3’!5’exo-), with a\nprimer consisting of the Illumina P2 sequence and a poly-C sequence homologous to the poly-G\ntail (seeTable 3) added to the DNA strand in the previous reaction. A 10μl reaction mix consist-\ning of 1μl of NEBuffer 4 (10x), 0.6μl of dNTP mix (25 mM each), 1μl of the P2 oligonucleotide\n(15 mM), 5.4μl of water, and 2μl of Klenow Fragment (3’!5’exo-; NEB, 5 U/μl) was added to\nthe 20μl of the TdT reaction mix, incubated at 23°C for 3 h, and heat-inactivated at 75°C for 20\nmin. The double stranded product was then blunt-ended by adding a mix consisting of 0.5μlo f\nNEBuffer 4 (10x), 0.35μl of BSA (10 mg/ml), 0.2μl of T4 DNA polymerase (NEB, 3 U/μl) and\n3.95 μl of water, and incubated at 12°C for 15 min. The resulting product was purified using\nAMPure XP:reaction ratio of 2:1 and resuspended in 10μl of 10 mM Tris buffer.\nBarcoded P1 adapters (seeTable 3) were ligated to the 5’-phosphorylated end of the double-\nstranded product in a 20μl reaction consisting of 10μl of the double-stranded DNA, 1μl of the\n25 uM adapters, 1x T4 DNA ligase buffer, and 400 U of T4 DNA ligase (NEB). Adapters have\nto be annealed before use in the RAD probes protocol. The reaction was incubated at 16°C\novernight. The resulting product was purified using an AMPure:reaction ratio of 1:1 and resus-\npended in 20μl of 10 mM Tris buffer. Ligated P1 adapters were filled-in in a 40μl reaction con-\nsisting of 20μl of purified ligation product, 1x ThermoPol reaction buffer (NEB), 12 U of Bst\npolymerase (NEB), and dNTPs (0.25 mM each), and incubated at 37°C for 20 min.\nThe resulting template was amplified by PCR adding 15μl of a mix consisting of 5μlo fQ 5\nreaction buffer (5x), 0.2μl of dNTPs (25 mM each), 2.5μl of the PCR primer mix (5μM each),\nand 0.5 U of Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) to the 10μ\nl of the template.\nThe program started with 20 sec at 98°C, followed by 25 cycles of 10 sec at 98°C, 20 sec at 60°C,\nand 25 sec at 72°C, followed by a final extension for 2 min at 72°C. Success of each PCR reac-\ntion was checked using gel electrophoresis, and the resulting products were purified using\nAMPure XP:reaction ratio of 0.7:1. Samples were then pooled in equimolar ratios.\nIn solution hybridization capture, library reamplification and sequencing\nThe hybridization capture and library enrichment steps described below are based on previously\npublished protocols [13, 25] with some modifications. The hybridization mix consisted of 6x SSC,\n5 0m ME D T A ,1 %S D S ,2 xD e n h a r d t’s solution, 2μM of each blocking oligonucleotide (to pre-\nvent hybridization of adapter sequences; seeTable 3), 500 to 1000 ng of the probes and 500 to\n1000 ng of the shotgun libraries, in a total volume of 40μl. On account of grasshopper larger\ngenome size and preliminary results indicating low signal-noise ratio in the butterfly libraries,\n500 ng of human Cot-1 DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) was added to theO. decorus\nhybridization mix in order to prevent non-specific hybridizations caused by repetitive sequences.\nThe mix was denatured at 95°C for 10 min and subsequently incubated at 65°C for 48 hours. The\nprobes, hybridized with targeted fragments of the library, were then separated on streptavidin\nbeads (Dynabeads M-280, Life Technologies). 10μl of the beads solution was washed three times\non the magnet with 200μl of TEN buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) and\nresuspended in 200μlo fT E N .4 0μl of the hybridization mix was added to the 200μl of the beads\nsolution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After separating the beads with the\nHybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD)\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651 March 21, 2016 8/2 2\nmagnet, the supernatant was removed and the beads were washed four times under different\nstringency conditions as follows. The beads were resuspended in 200μl of 65°C 1x SSC/0.1% SDS\nwash buffer, incubated for 15 min at 65°C, separated on the magnet and the supernatant was\nremoved. The above step was performed again with 1x SSC/0.1% SDS, followed by 0.5x SSC/0.1%\nSDS and 0.1x SSC/0.1% SDS. Finally, the hybridization-enriched product was washed-off from\nthe probes by adding 30μl of 80°C water and incubating at 80°C for 10 min.\nEnrichment of the captured libraries was performed in a 50μl PCR reaction containing 1x\nQ5 reaction buffer (NEB), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5μM of each PCR primer (the P1 universal\nprimer and one of the 12 P2 indexed primers, seeTable 3), 1U of Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity\nDNA Polymerase (NEB), and 15μl of the template. The program started with 20 sec initial\ndenaturation at 98°C; followed by 25 PCR cycles of 10 sec at 98°C, 20 sec at 60°C, and 25 sec at\n72°C; and a final extension for 2 min at 72°C. The enriched-captured libraries were purified\nusing an AMPure XP:reaction ratio 1:1 and pooled in equimolar ratios for sequencing (seeS2\nFig for a profile example of the re-amplified capture library after AMPure purification).\nThe probes precursors (RAD library) for the butterfly libraries were sequenced on one lane\nof Illumina MiSeq 300 bp single-end. Butterfly capture-enriched libraries were sequenced on\none lane of MiSeq 150 bp paired-end, and grasshopper capture-enriched libraries were\nsequenced on one lane of Illumina HiSeq 100 bp paired-end.\nUpdated versions of the lab protocol can be found athttps://github.com/chiasto/hyRAD.\nData analysis\nThe hyRAD datasets correspond to target-enriched libraries and cannot be analysed with the\nusual RAD pipelines [26, 27] Indeed, although they were generated using RAD loci, the\nobtained sequences are not flanked by the restriction sites and instead may not overlap\ncompletely and/or extend before and after the RAD locus. As a result, the analysis pipeline\nmust include the following steps:\n1. demultiplexing and cleaning of raw reads;\n2. building of reference sequences for each RAD locus;\n3. alignment of reads against the obtained references;\n4. SNP calling.\nAll bioinformatic steps of the hyRAD pipeline can be run athttps://insidedna.me.\nDemultiplexing and data preparation\nThe obtained reads were demultiplexed using thefastx_barcode_splitter toolfrom the FAS-\nTX-Toolkit package [28]. RAD-seq sequences (probe precursors) were processed by Trim\nGalore! [29] and cleaned with thefastq-mcf toolfrom ea-utils package [30] to remove low qual-\nity nucleotides and adapter sequences. The PCR duplicates were removed from RAD-seq\nprobes precursors and hyRAD datasets using the MarkDuplicates tool of Picard toolkit [31].\nReads from hyRAD libraries were tested for exogeneous DNA contamination using BLAST\nagainst NCBI nucleotide database (50,000 reads for sonicated or non-sonicated fresh or\nmuseum DNA samples).\nExploring the methods of reference creation onLycaena hellelibraries\nPaired-end reads obtained from the hybridization-capture library for each sample were\nmapped onto three references: (1) consensus sequences for the clustered RAD-seq reads\nHybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD)\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651 March 21, 2016 9/2 2\n(RAD-ref), (2) RAD-seq reads extended using hybridization-captured reads (RAD-ref-ext),\nand (3) contigs assembled from the reads of hybridization-captured samples (assembly-ref). As\nwe had no reference genome available, we focused on checking the numbers of loci/SNPs\nobtained by mapping the reads on each reference and the overlap of the loci obtained using dif-\nferent methods. Theoretically, we should be able to retrieve all the loci from the sequenced\nprobe precursors (RAD-seq library) in the captured libraries. We thus evaluate the number of\ncaptured loci homologous to those retrieved by sequencing the RAD-seq libraries.However,\ndifferent factors affect signal to noise ratio (i.e. the proportion of fragments homologous with\nthe probe) in the captured libraries and can decrease the numbers of homologous fragments\nretrieved.\nVsearch RAD loci clustering (RAD-ref).High quality reads of RAD probes were clus-\ntered by similarity usingVsearch [32] to obtain loci for further mapping the reads from the\nhybridization-capture libraries. Before Vsearch run, we converted cleaned fastq files into fasta\nformat using thefasta_to_fastq toolfrom the the FASTX-Toolkit package [28]. To obtain the\nmost reliable contigs across samples, Vsearch was run in two iterations. During the first itera-\ntion, we obtained consensus clusters at the within-individual level (i.e. clustering of the raw\nreads for each sample independently). During the second iteration, Vsearch was run on the\nconsensus clusters obtained from the first iteration. The second iteration allowed us to obtain\nconsensus clusters at the among-individual level. For both iterations we ran Vsearch with vari-\nous identity thresholds (0.51, 0.61, 0.71, 0.81, 0.83, 0.91, 0.93, 0.96, 0.98 for the within-individ-\nual level and 0.51, 0.61, 0.71, 0.81, 0.85, 0.88 for the among-individual level) in order to identify\nan optimal identity threshold for clustering, i.e. a threshold that maximizes the number of clus-\nters with a minimal coverage of 2x and 3x, respectively. In all cases, we used the cluster_fast\noption for clustering. The consensus sequences of each secondary cluster were then used as\nlocus references in subsequent alignment and SNP calling steps.\nVsearch RAD loci clustering and extension using captured reads (RAD-ref-ext).To\nobtain RAD-ref-ext, we iteratively extended contigs of the RAD-ref using reads from the\nhybridization-capture library (by pooling reads contributed by all the analysed specimens)\nusing PriceTI [33] with 30 cycles of extension and a minimum overlap of a sequence match to\n30. The obtained references were trimmed by 60 bp at each end in order to remove sequences\nwith putatively low-quality ends. We applied this tough threshold for RAD-ref-ext only, as\nprobes extension can be performed on very low-coverage data, and we therefore wanted to\nkeep the error rate (usually higher on both sequence ends) at the minimum.\nDe-novo assembly from captured reads only (assembly-ref).Assembly was performed\non the hybridization-captured reads of one good quality ethanol-preserved, sonicated, sample.\nOnly sequences obtained from the single fresh sample were used, as stringent cleaning parame-\nters in Trimmomatic [34], used for the reference construction, led to a large loss (up to 80%) of\nthe reads from historical samples (and such data was therefore less optimal than that from the\nfresh specimen for producing a reference). Moreover, using one individual allows obtaining a\nmore reliable reference, as any among-sample divergence can result in bubbles in the contigs\nand bias the assembly by oversplitting alleles. As a result we could have obtained chimeric\nduplicated loci presented in different contigs. We usedSOAPdenovo V2.04 to assemble cleaned\nreads into contigs [35].\nMapping and SNP calling\nReads from the hyRAD library were cleaned by Trimmomatic with milder parameters than\nreads used in thede novoassembly (keeping 60–85% of the reads in historical specimens).\nRead mapping was performed usingbowtie2-build for the reference indexing andbowtie2 for\nHybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD)\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651 March 21, 2016 10 / 22\nmapping [36], PCR duplicates were removed using the MarkDuplicates tool from the Picard\ntoolkit [31] and SNPs were called with FreeBayes using the default parameters [37, 38]. To\nevaluate the level of DNA damage in museum DNA samples, we usedmapDamage2.0 that\nrescales base quality scores of putatively post-mortem damaged bases [39] in order to minimize\npresence of post-mortem conversions in the resulting SNPs. Datasets for replicates were\nmerged and analysed for SNPs with FreeBayes. Obtained VCF files were filtered by the vcffilter\ntool from the vcflib [40] and VCFtools [41]. In the resulting set only biallelic sites with high\nquality (PHRED>30), minor allele count larger than 1/6 of all, present in at least 50% of the\nsamples and with a minimum depth of 6 were kept, indels were removed. Potential paralogs\nand multi-copy sites were removed based on a coverage of a standard-deviation three times\nhigher than the mean [42]. VCF format files [43] were converted to SNP-based NEXUS files\nusing PGDSpider converter [44] and to structure data files for every individual using the vcf-\nconsensus tool (see alsoFig 2). Updated versions of the bioinformatic pipeline can be found at\nhttps://github.com/chiasto/hyRAD.\nGenetic structure\nIn order to check whether data was reflecting genetic structure, we applied fastStructure, a\nStructure-like algorithm adapted to large SNP genotype data [45] to the six final datasets\n(RAD-ref, RAD-ref-ext and assembly-ref, both for samples with and without sonication). The\nanalyses were conducted using asimple priorand assuming two groups (k = 2).\nOverlap between assembly references\nTo evaluate the level of overlap among the three assembly references forL. helle (RAD-ref,\nRAD-ref-ext, and assembly-ref) we used theOrthoMCL [46] pipeline for orthology detection.\nMost of the pipeline was run with the default parameters, except for Blastall and MCL cluster-\ning steps. Here, we used more stringent parameter values (e-value of 0.0001 and MCL was run\nwith an inflation parameter of 2.0) in order to reduce chances of detecting false orthology\ngroups. As a result, we obtained clusters of contigs being contributed by the three assembly ref-\nerences. We then counted how many of these clusters–presumably corresponding to homolo-\ngous loci–were shared among the available reference assembly approaches. Eventually, to\nreveal the number of RAD loci present in the references, reads of the raw RAD library were\nmapped on RAD-ref and assembly-ref using bowtie2 [36] and levels of mapping were\ncompared.\nProof of concept: application of hyRAD toOedaleus decorus\nThe utility of the method was further validated using 49 museum and fresh samples of a Pale-\narctic grasshopper species for which a marked east-west spatial genetic structure was identified\npreviously [22]. The catalog was built based on eight specimens from the captured library that\nshowed the largest number of reads and spanned the species’distribution area (Switzerland,\nItaly, Spain, Russia), using the method that yielded the highest number of contigs and pro-\nduced consistent genetic structure inL. helle (assembly-ref, i.e.,denovo reference built using\nSOAPdenovo, seeResults and Discussionsection andTable 4). The generated contigs were\nblasted against GenBank databases for bacterial, fungal and technical sequences with a mini-\nmum E-value threshold of 0.1. Endogeneous contigs of each samples were assembled to gener-\nate the final reference using Geneious V9.0.2 [47]. Filters were subsequently applied to keep\nonly high quality and informative SNPs as for theL. helle libraries. The final VCF matrix was\nconverted into Structure format using PGDSpider V2.0.9.0 [44] and population structure was\nHybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD)\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651 March 21, 2016 11 / 22\ninferred using fastStructure [45] using asimple priorand assuming two groups (k = 2). Quan-\ntum GIS V2.4.0 was used to present the geographic distribution of the genetic clusters [48].\nResults and Discussion\nSequencing and data quality\nLycaena hellelibraries. RAD-seq libraries sequencing yielded 14,188,023 and hybridiza-\ntion-capture libraries 16,636,502 raw reads: 8,217,522 for sonicated and 8,418,980 for non-son-\nicated samples. Additional sequencing of the reference library from the ethanol-preserved\nspecimen (used for the RAD-ref creation) yielded 4,703,744 reads. The proportion of reads\nkept after quality filtering varied with sample age and preparation method. For the ethanol-\npreserved sample, 89.8% of reads from sonicated and 89.4% from non-sonicated sample were\nretained. For the 30 years old samples the mean was 74.3% and 79.6%, and for 58 years old\nsamples 70.8% and 73.8% for sonicated and non-sonicated samples, respectively.\nOedaleus decoruslibraries. Hybridization-capture libraries yielded a total of 69,306,042\nraw reads. After quality filtering, 80.3% of reads were kept among all the samples.\nComparison of references obtained forL. helle libraries\nProportion of single-hit alignments and SNP numbers.Consensus clustering of the\nRAD-based reference within individuals produced the largest number of clusters with 2x and\n3x coverage with a clustering identity threshold of 0.91, compared to other threshold values.\nConsensus clustering among individuals produced the best results with a clustering identity\nthreshold of 0.71 (seeS3 Fig).\nThe highest number, length and the total length of reference contigs were obtained usingde\nnovo assembly with SOAPdenovo (assembly-ref; Table 4). Both RAD-based assemblies pro-\nduced an order of magnitude lower number of contigs. The extension performed on the\nobtained RAD reference followed by trimming of adapter sequences resulted in references with\nan average shorter length (lower N50) than the starting contigs— whereas priceTI extended a\nlarge number of probes, this did not reflect in a substantially higher average loci length because\nof further trimming of obtained contigs.\nThe highest levels of single-hit alignments for most of the samples, except the oldest ones,\nfor both preparation methods (sonicated and not sonicated) were obtained when mapped on\nthe sequenced RAD loci extended using PriceTI (RAD-ref-ext). This method was followed by\nde novoassembly using reads from the hybridization-capture library from a single fresh speci-\nmen (assembly-ref) and mapping on the RAD loci (RAD-ref); although the difference between\nthe last two approaches was not large (Fig 3). Only for the oldest samples as well as in the non-\nsonicated fresh sample,de novoreference provided slightly better results.\nIn terms of the number of SNPs retained after coverage, paralogs and among-samples over-\nlap filtering, the RAD-ref pipeline detected the highest numbers of loci, regardless of sample\nage and preparation (Fig 4). No clear correlation with sample age could be observed, although\nTable 4.

A higher number of SNPs was detected in the sonicated library only for the fresh\nspecimens.\nRAD-sequencing datasets depend on the presence of the restriction sites and therefore any\npolymorphism in such sites leads to either missing loci or alleles.

The spatial\ngenetic structure inferred by fastStructure revealed that the eight samples are divided into two\nclusters of, respectively, seven Finnishvs. one Romanian sample only when using the non-soni-\ncated library mapped to the assembly-ref catalog. This result is in agreement with the hypothe-\nsis that when using sonicated DNA, we are at high risk of incorporating contaminant DNA\nwhich can blur the signal (Matthias Meyer, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropol-\nogy, Liepzig, DE; personal communication). This is an interesting result as BLAST analyses on\nthe six catalogs did not retrieve differences in the level of known contaminants (see below).\nLoci overlap among the assembly methods.About 15.2% of the reference loci obtained\nvia de novoassembly were shared with those based on the clustering of RAD-seq reads (either\nRAD-ref or RAD-ref-ext;Fig 5).

When mapping raw RAD reads on\nRAD-ref, 26.3% did not map, 42.4% mapped once and 31.3% mapped more than once. This\nshows that RAD-ref summarizes ca. ¾ of the reads from the RAD dataset. In contrast, when\nmapping raw RAD reads on assembly-ref, 78,3% of reads did not map, 21,6% mapped once\nand 0,1% mapped more than once. This result shows that assembly-ref possibly contains three\nquarters of all loci that are not homologous to the RAD probes. Such low signal to noise ratio\n(targeted reads to the number of total reads) is most likely a result of background carryover in\nthe hybridization capture step, a phenomenon which can have many sources., It could result\nfrom ‘daisy-chaining’of the captured fragments [49, 50], where partially complementary DNA\nmolecules hybridize with the other fragments that are already hybridized to the probes. We can\nhowever discard this explanation as a primary reason for the background carryover as extend-\ning of RAD probes did not produce longer contigs (in RAD-ref-ext assemblies). Another likely\nreason could be carryover of random DNA fragments with repetitive sequences. The extent of\nsuch process can be significantly reduced by adding blocking agents to the hybridization mix\n(typically Cot-1 as was performed for theO.decorus dataset [51] or salmon sperm DNA), as\nwell as optimizing hybridization temperature and wash stringency to increase capture\nFig 5. Number of loci obtained using different bioinformatic approaches, identified using the OrthoMCL [42] pipeline for orthology detection.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651.g005\nHybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD)\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651 March 21, 2016 15 / 22\nefficiency. Such developments are desirable because they increase the percentage of reads\nmatching the loci of interest and eventually improve the overall sequencing coverage.\nEffects of sample preparation and age on the numbers of SNPs obtained\nand the exogeneous DNA content\nReads can be mapped on a reference either once with a highest score (i.e., single mapping) or on\nmore than one region of reference with close scores (i.e., multi mapping). The reasons for multi-\nmapping events can be biological (e.g., paralog sequences) or technical (splitting single loci into\nmore reference loci), nevertheless these mapping events cannot be used for SNP calling and offer\nanother benchmark for the assembly methods used. Differences in the number of single mapping\nevents and in the numbers of SNPs obtained were not substantial between sonicated and non-son-\nicated samples, and depended on the sample age and the bioinformatic pipeline used (Figs3 and\n4). We expected that museum specimens should perform better without sonication, as the DNA\nwas already visibly fragmented, and sonication of museum specimens may increase the levels of\nexogenous DNA contamination (by fragmenting intact fungal or bacterial DNA contaminating\nmuseum samples; M. Meyer, pers. comm.). In terms of mapping events, whereas the fresh sample\nusually showed a better ratio of single- to multi-mapping events when sonicated, there was a trend\ntowards a higher percentage of unique mapping events for non-sonicated 30-years old museum\nspecimens, on average 1.3 times higher, irrespective of the reference used (the difference was less\nclear for 58-years old museum specimens, and depended on the reference used). We would there-\nfore advise not to sonicate DNA obtained from the museum specimens, which significantly cuts\ndown the price and time required for library preparation, except in cases when no signs of degra-\ndation are observable on the DNA profile. As levels of DNA degradation of contemporary samples\nmay vary, one may consider that the sonication step should be advisable when working with well-\npreserved DNA. However, this is still an open question, as whereas BLAST searches did not\nretrieve higher fractions of contaminants in sonicatedvs. non-sonicated libraries, the expected\npopulation structure was retrieved was the non-sonicated one mapped on assembly-ref.\nAs one of the main types of post-mortem DNA degradation is deamination of cytosines,\nhighly damaged ancient or museum DNA samples are usually characterized by higher uracil\ncontent [52–54]. In classical library preparation protocols, the usage of a proofreading poly-\nmerases should stall the chain elongation in the presence of uracil and thus reduce the misin-\ncorporation errors in the final dataset. On the other hand this approach might not be optimal\nfor highly degraded ancient DNA samples, where a large fraction of DNA fragments may carry\ncytosine to uracil misincorporations [53]. Moreover the usage of a proofreading polymerase\ndoes not prevent the misincorporations caused by direct deamination of methylated cytosine\nto thymine, or less common deamination of guanidine to adenine [52, 54]. In the protocol used\nabove [15], the second strand synthesis was performed using Klenow Fragment (3’!5’exo-),\nlacking proofreading ability, and thus approximately half of the resulting DNA fragments\nshould have cytosine to uracil misincorporation substituted for thymine, amplifiable by proof-\nreading DNA polymerase. We thus opted for a bioinformatic post-processing way of filtering-\nout such bases. Post-mortem damage in the sequenced samples was assessed by mapDam-\nage2.0, which rescales sequence files by downscaling quality scores of likely post-mortem dam-\naged bases. As some SNPs became filtered by lower quality scores after the rescaling, the\nnumber of SNPs is decreased after mapDamage2.0. We expected higher number of discarded\nSNPs in the oldest samples, because of a higher proportion of DNA damage occurring with\ntime. The proportion of SNPs discarded after applying mapDamage2.0 was the highest among\nthe 58 years old samples (1.46% for RAD-ref; 1.89% for RAD-ref-ext; 2.36% for assembly-ref),\nalthough relatively low, given the samples’age and preservation type (seeS1 Table).\nHybridization Capture Using RAD Probes (hyRAD)\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0151651 March 21, 2016 16 / 22\nIt is worth mentioning, that the higher number of SNPs detected in libraries from museum\nspecimens, comparing to the fresh samples, is not an effect of post-mortem damage (an oppo-\nsite trend was detected with the higest proportion of type II transitions to transitions [55] and\ntransversions present in the fresh specimens;S4 Fig)\nApplication: spatial genetic structure ofOedaleus decorus\nThe de novoreference catalog was composed of 408,851 reference contigs. The N50 length was\n321 bp and the total length was 119,789,911 bp. Among the total number of contigs, 9% were\nshown to be of exogeneous origin by the BLAST search, either against fungi and bacteria Gen-\nBank databases or against technical sequences. Such a level of contaminants is expected here,\nas in contrast to theL. helle references, which were built from fresh samples, theO. decorus\nassembly-ref was based on eight specimens from the captured library— either fresh or pin-\nmounted— that showed the largest number of reads. A total of 4,783,774 informative sites were\nretrieved after SNP calling. After removing indels and low quality sites, 125,890 sites were con-\nserved. Keeping only biallelic loci with a minor allele count of at least 6, with data fullness\nhigher or equal to 50% of the samples, we obtained 6,046 loci. Finally, we conserved 2,979\nSNPs after the removal of potential paralogous sites. The median depth for each SNP was 10.\nOn average, each of the 49 samples were characterized by 1864 SNPs and each SNP was found\nin 32 individuals (62.7% of matrix fullness).\nThe spatial genetic structure inferred by fastStructure revealed two geographically distinct\nclades in the west and the east of the Palearctic (Fig 6). This result supports the eastern-western\nsplit previously highlighted inOedaleus decorusbased on mtDNA amplicons [22]. This dem-\nonstrates that hyRAD is a reliable technique to infer spatial genetic structure from both fresh\nsamples and museum samples collected at various time points in the past.\nConclusions\nHere, we present a method for obtaining large sets of homologous loci from museum speci-\nmens, without any a priori genome information. Despite the differences in single-mapping\nFig 6.

We obtained\naround a thousand of SNPs fromL. helle samples up to 58 years old, confirming that it can be\nsuccessfully applied in the field of museum genomics. The application of the catalog-building\nmethod that was the most promising for resolving population genetic structure (i.e., non-soni-\ncated library mapped to assembly-ref) to the grasshopperO. decorus, confirmed the usefulness\nof hyRAD to retrieve phylogeographic data using museum samples up to one hundred years\nold. Our method does not require time-consuming and costly probes design and synthesis, nor\naccess to fresh samples for RNA extraction, making it one of the simplest and most straightfor-\nward technique for obtaining orthologous loci from degraded museum samples.\nIn the protocol, we applied a modified shotgun library preparation method, optimized for\ndegraded DNA from museum specimens [15]. However, the capture protocol presented here\ncan be applied to any type of library preparation, including commercial ones, simplifying the\nworkflow and cutting down the preparation time.\nWe also explored several bioinformatic approaches for loci assembly from the captured librar-\nies, a crucial step when working on organisms without a reference genome. Identifying the most\nappropriate catalog-building method may depend on the goals of each study. In our case, the\npipeline that was the best at identifying population structure in the butterfly was relying on a\nnon-sonicated library mapped to thede novoreference assembly from captured reads from a sin-\ngle ethanol-preserved specimen, using SOAPdenovo assembler (assembly-ref). Despite the fact\nthat a maximum of 26% of the obtained sequences mapped to the references and the proportion\nof single mapping events were not higher than 10% on average (Fig 3), we could successfully call\naround a thousand of loci in each case (Fig 4), with high coverage across the samples.\nImportantly from the wetlab protocol perspective, in the hybridization step, we have used\nblocking oligonucleotides to prevent‘daisy-chaining’of captured sequences by adapter\nsequences’homology. Using a blocking agent preventing similar chaining caused by repetitive\nsequences (Cot-1 DNA, applied to the grasshopper libraries, see below [51]) as well as optimizing\nthe conditions of hybridization and capture reactions for increased stringency (e.g., by decreasing\nhybridization temperature and the stringency of the washes using higher concentration of SDS\nand/or lower concentration of SSC) may further increase the hybridization efficiency and thus\nthe numbers of reads mapping on the reference and reduce the number of low-coverage loci.\nThe de novoassembly building pipeline produced the largest contig of 2,352 bp for the but-\nterfly and 13,103 bp for the grasshopper dataset. Although the mean length of the assembled\ncontigs was much smaller, our method also allows retrieving longer sequences than the length\nof the probes used. The reason for this is that captured sequences hybridize with other DNA\nfragments with homologous sequences, flanking the probe sequence (i.e.,‘daisy-chaining’[49,\n50]). This may lead to enrichment across larger fractions of genome, a side effect of our\nmethod, that can be utilized for assembly of larger contigs by using longer probes and captur-\ning longer targets.\nThe method presented here, although based on the restriction enzyme digestion of DNA to\ncreate the random genomic probes, does not depend on the restriction site presence in the cap-\ntured library. This represents a significant improvement over classical RAD-sequencing data-\nsets, in which increase in the phylogenetic distance among samples is correlated with an\nincrease in the number of missing sites [56–61], sometimes leading to conflicting signals\nbetween RAD- and capture-based datasets [62], or are characterized by the presence of null\nalleles that lead to heterozygosity orF\nST underestimation [9, 10]. In this aspect, our approach is\nsimilar to other capture-enrichment protocols, such as UltraConserved Elements [5]o r\nexome-capture [4], with the benefit of much simpler and less expensive probe generation, with-\nout access to genome information or fresh specimens for RNA isolation.
