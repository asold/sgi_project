This ubiquity means that there is the potential\nfor objective smartphone data to be used to address research questions in the real world [2].\nIndeed, there has been a rapid increase in the number of publications examining the relation-\nship between smartphone use, personality, cognition, health, and behaviour e.g. [3–8]. Despite\nthis, smartphones themselves have yet to become a standard item in the psychologist’s research\ntoolbox, and little is known about the validity of self-reported estimates of smartphone use.\nMiller recently [9] highlighted how important it is for social science researchers to be cur-\nrent with new developments in smartphone research methods. Perhaps the biggest barrier to\nexploring the objective (actual) use of smartphone data includes developing suitable apps and\nthe appropriate tools for processing, analysing and visualising big-data sets [10]. Whereas open\nsource software to createAndroid apps is freely available for those with no programming expe-\nrience [11], there remains no open source software for analysing and visualising the resulting\ndata.\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139004 October 28, 2015 1/9\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Andrews S, Ellis DA, Shaw H, Piwek L\n(2015) Beyond Self-Report: Tools to Compare\nEstimated and Real-World Smartphone Use.

The funders\nhad no role in study design, data collection and\nanalysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the\nmanuscript.\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nWhile self-report data can be collected successfully in situations where it is difficult to obtain\nobjective data, this may not be an appropriate measure when it comes to estimating smart-\nphone use. It remains possible that estimates are sufficient for some research questions. but\nmuch of the cognitive literature on time-perception suggests we are poor at estimating such\ndurations [12]. Any subjective estimate is also likely to ignore rapid, yet pervasive, checking\nbehaviours [13].\nHere we propose that a simple measure— recording when the phone is in use— can provide\na vast array of information about an individual's daily routine. We describe and explore differ-\nent metrics for objective evaluation of smartphone data, and what this can reveal about smart-\nphone use. We include source code for processing, visualising and analysing objective\nsmartphone data, which can be used by those with little to no programming knowledge. As an\napplied example, we then explore the claim that people engage in habitual smartphone check-\ning behaviours, by correlating self-report smartphone use estimates with actual smartphone\nuse and standardised measures of problem mobile phone use [14]. We finally consider other\nresearch questions that could be explored with this methodology.\nMethod\nParticipants\nTwenty-nine participants were recruited (17 female, mean age = 22.52, range = 18–33). All par-\nticipants ownedAndroid smartphones and consisted of staff and students at the University of\nLincoln. A priori calculations suggest this number to be adequate for finding a moderate corre-\nlation between actual and self-reported use, so we stopped collecting after this number was\nreached. The study conformed to the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki. All par-\nticipants provided written and oral informed consent after being advised of the purpose of the\nstudy, and the type of data being collected. Approval for the project was obtained from the\nSchool of Psychology Research Ethics Committee at the University of Lincoln. All participants\nwere reimbursed a small fee (£10) for their time. Two participants were excluded as they had\ntechnological problems partway through the study, while four additional participants were\nexcluded from the analysis for not providing all self-report estimates.\nMaterials\nSmartphone Application: We developed anAndroid smartphone app usingFunf in a Box[11].\nApps collecting data fromAndroid devices are generated by selecting sensors, and specifying\nsampling frequency. We selected the screen on/off option, resulting in a small app that records\na timestamp when a use starts and ends. Data is encrypted and uploaded to a server over Wi-Fi\n(for more details see [11]). Our app simply recorded a timestamp when the phone became\nactive, and a second when this interaction ended (typically screen use, although this also\nincludes processor intensive activities including calls and playing music).\nMobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS): This questionnaire consists of 27 items, which\nhave previously demonstrated positive correlations with self-reported mobile phone use [14].\nThe MPPUS remains a highly cited scale across health and psychological research [15–19], and\nhas been used as an additional means of measuring mobile phone use more generally [6, 20,\n21]) (Cronbach's alpha = .89 for standardised items in our sample).\nProcedure\nOn arrival at the lab, a smartphone application was installed on participants' smartphones.\nThey were then sent a standardised SMS that they were asked to relay back to the experimenter,\nWhat’s Going On (and Off) with Smartphones?\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139004 October 28, 2015 2/9\nto determine the length of time taken to check a message. Time taken was recorded from the\nnotification tone until the message had been relayed. Participants were asked to record an esti-\nmate each evening of how long they used their phone that day, for the next 14 consecutive\ndays. We asked participants to only estimate their phone use during periods where their phone\nscreen was switched on, as theFunf on-off sensor was advertised as measuring screen state.\nHowever, during testing, it was discovered that the on-off sensor actually measured whether\nthe phone was in an interactive state, which included activities such as phone calls and listening\nto music, commonly done with the screen switched off. While we did not analyse the diary\ndata further, it is possible that the process influenced participants’later estimations of their\nphone use. When participants returned to the lab after 14 days, they were asked to estimate\nhow much they used their phone on average each day (including calls and listening to music).\nThis measure was used in subsequent analyses of subjective estimates. They were then asked to\nestimate how many times they use their phone each day (number of uses), and finally were\nasked to complete the MPPUS. The app was then uninstalled from their device.\nData from the app were converted into a comma separate values file usingFunf processing\nscripts. This file was further processed using source code to calculate descriptive statistics and\nbarcode visualisations (as shown inFig 1; seeS1 Appendixfor source code). The scripts allow\nthe user to explore different times of day (morning, afternoon, evening, and night), and to\nexplore different metrics associated with checking behaviours of different durations (N.B. the\nsource code requires Matlab 2014b or later). These can be calculated separately for each day, or\nacross the entire duration of a study. We use descriptive statistics for the first 14 days of the\nstudy throughout. Some timestamps showed very long single use durations (i.e.> 5 hours).\nAnother limitation to the application is that when the phone switches off, the app does not\nrecord the screen turning off. When the phone is turned on again, it also does not record the\nscreen turning on. This results in a seemingly long‘on’duration, when the phone itself was\nactually turned off. It was therefore unclear whether long durations during the day were as a\nresult of the phone being in use (e.g. listening to music, or watching a film), or whether the\nFig 1. Barcode of smartphone use over two weeks.Black areas indicate times where the phone was in use and Saturdays are indicated with a red dashed\nline. Weekday alarm clock times (and snoozing) are clearly evident.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139004.g001\nWhat’s Going On (and Off) with Smartphones?\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139004 October 28, 2015 3/9\nphone was turned off. As it is impossible to be sure that all long durations were because of this,\nwe retain these data in all analyses, and use median values when calculating an average values\nfor each day, as this is a more accurate summary of the average use length. We then use these\nvalues to calculate the mean use length for each participant. We established that occasions\nwhen this occurred overnight were the result of the phone being turned off. The included\nsource code (S1 Appendix) enables the visualisation of the data for each participant across all\ndays, or to create an‘average heatmap’of one day, seven days, or weekdays and weekends (not\nshown here).\nResults\nObjective Data\nThe mean daily number of uses and the mean length of these durations (including a median\nlength for all the durations in a day) and a mean daily duration of phone use (total daily dura-\ntion) were calculated for each participant. Participants used their phones a mean of 84.68 times\neach day (SD = 55.23) and spent 5.05 hours each day using their smartphone (SD = 2.73).\nLength of use was, unsurprisingly, highly skewed, with 55% of all uses less than 30 seconds in\nduration (seeFig 2).\nWe classify‘checks’as uses up to 15 seconds in duration. To explore these behaviours more\nclosely, we analysed the percentage of phone interactions with durations under 15 seconds.\nThese showed three distinct periods of increased use; from 1-3s, 5-6s, and 10–11 seconds.Fig 3\nshows a histogram of such checks (in 0.5 second bins). In the lab, mean time taken to unlock\nthe phone and read a short message was 8.42s (SD = 1.53). With added distractions outside the\nlab, the 10-11s time bin is likely to reflect the time taken to read a short message, check the\ntime or other notifications. We explored whether any of these durations could result from the\nFig 2. Percentage of uses categorised by duration.This illustrates the highly skewed nature of smartphone usage.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139004.g002\nWhat’s Going On (and Off) with Smartphones?\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139004 October 28, 2015 4/9\ndisplay turning itself off, after a period of being idle. However, results indicated that these\ndefault times did not explain any spike in use (default display off times: meanLOCKED =\n274.88s, SDLOCKED = 842.85s; meanUNLOCKED = 282.06s, SDUNLOCKED = 524.33s).\nWe also compared phone use at different times of day; night (00:00–06:00), morning\n(06:00–12:00), afternoon (12:00–18:00), and evening (18:00–24:00), as shown inFig 4. In this\ncomparison we calculate median duration length— i.e. the median amount of time a user\nengaged with their phone before turning the display off— for each participant. Finally, we\nexplored the total duration spent using the phone at each time of day. For the purposes of this\nanalysis, phone uses that spanned two time windows (e.g. commencing in the morning and\nending in the afternoon) was allocated to the time period in which it originated.\nThree one-way repeated measures ANOVAs (Time of Day; morning, afternoon, evening,\nnight) were calculated separately for total daily duration, use length, and number of uses. Data\nfrom one participant was removed from total daily duration and median use length analyses, as\nthey had no data from the night time period. There was a significant difference in the number\nof phone uses at different times of day (F(3, 78) = 34.62,p < .001, η\nρ\n2 = .571). Tukey's LSD\ncomparisons revealed more individual uses in the afternoon and evening than in the morning\nFig 3.

Fig 4ashows these differences. There were no significant differences in total daily dura-\ntion at different times of day (F(3, 78) = .94,p = .414,ηρ\n2 = .036; seeFig 4b, nor in median use\nlength (F(3, 78) = 2.33,p = .081,ηρ\n2 = .082; seeFig 4c).\nComparison of objective and subjective measures of smartphone use\nWe conducted paired-samples t-tests and Pearson correlations to compare actual and esti-\nmated smartphone use (seeTable 1). For number of phone uses, there were far more actual\nphone uses (84.68) than were estimated (37.20;t(23) = 3.93,p < .001), and no significant corre-\nlation between the two (r(21) = .11,p = .610) indicating that estimated number of phone uses\ndoes not reflect actual number of uses. For total daily duration there was no significant differ-\nence between actual (5.05 hours) and estimated use (4.12 hours;t(22) = 1.78,p = .086) and\nthere was a moderate positive correlation between the two (p = .02). This suggests that esti-\nmated duration of use may have reasonable relative validity.\nWe finally compared scores on the MPPUS with objective and estimated smartphone use\nand checks using Pearson's correlations (seeTable 1). None of these analyses revealed any sig-\nnificant relationships (ps > .15). Ten participants scored more than 2SD greater than Bianchi\n& Phillips’[14] mean, indicating problem use.\nDiscussion\nEstimated levels of smartphone use have previously been related to sleep, interpersonal rela-\ntionships, driving safety, and personality [5, 7, 22, 23]. Here we observe that self-reported esti-\nmates of phone use relate moderately to actual behavior in such situations. Conversely,\nestimated number of checks showed no clear relationship with actual uses; indeed, actual uses\namounted to more than double the estimated number. It is possible that our limited sample\nsize obscured a larger effect size. Nevertheless, we suggest that estimated use may not be suffi-\ncient if a higher resolution of data are required, but that estimates of total use are likely to be\nadequate for many research designs. However, for exploring checking behaviours, estimated\nnumber of uses show little reliability for measuring actual uses.\nThe quantity of short checking behaviours we observed are comparable with those found by\nOulasvirta and colleagues [24], who collected data in 2009. Smartphone use has become much\nmore prevalent in the intervening six years, and it would be easy to assume that smartphone\nuse would increase accordingly. However, our data indicate that checking behaviours are no\nmore prevalent now than they were six years ago. It is interesting to note that people have little\nawareness of the frequency with which they check their phone. Oulasvirta and colleagues made\nthis claim in 2012, however this is the first paper to demonstrate that rapid mobile phone inter-\nactions are habitual [25]. While phone interactions under thirty seconds have previously been\nclassified as 'checking behaviours', our data suggest that habitual goal-and reward-based\nactions are likely to be less than 15 seconds in duration when it comes to checking the time or\nmessage notifications.\nIn our study, the MPPUS did not correlate with any measure of phone use— actual or esti-\nmated. The MPPUS is used not only as a measure of problem phone use, but also as an addi-\ntional measure of phone use more generally. To determine validity of the MPPUS for this\npurpose, we correlated objective phone use with MPPUS scores. This is not to say that the\nMPPUS lacks validity, but rather that people use smartphones for a variety of reasons [26], and\nthat increased use does not necessitate a problem in itself [27]. It may seem reasonable to\nassume that those who spend a long time on their phone have problem mobile phone use.\nWhat’s Going On (and Off) with Smartphones?\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139004 October 28, 2015 6/9\nHowever, heavy users are not necessarily the same as problem users. While it is easy to conflate\nheavy use with problem use, research into smartphone use should identify heavy use and prob-\nlem use independently of one another (e.g. [8]).\nExamining how much people actually use their smartphone can be useful for a variety of\napplications. For example, all except one of our participants used their phone as an alarm\nclock, and most reported that they always use their phone last thing before sleeping. These\nusage patterns therefore provide a non-invasive indication of sleep length, which has the poten-\ntial to augment sleep diary data [28]. Furthermore, while we have considered usage patterns\nacross the day, a further extension to this analysis would be to consider how these patterns\nacross different days of the week. This is likely to have additional social and occupational con-\nsequences [29].\nTrull and Ebner-Priemer [9] and Miller [10] argue that smartphone data have a great deal\nto offer as a research tool in psychology, yet comparatively little research utilises objective\nsmartphone data. Here we show that estimates of smartphone use have a place within current\nresearch, but we caution that its validity is limited and should be complimented by measure-\nments of real behaviour. We also provide the first method to automatically sample and easily\nvisualise the frequency of smartphone use with a simple background app. We hope that meth-\nods described in this paper will help overcome some barriers to accessing smartphone data for\nresearch in psychology and that it will form a foundation to build upon in the coming years.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Appendix.
