  "abstract": "Abstract To increase the classification accuracy of a protection scheme for power transformer, an effective convolution neural network (CNN) extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) combination is proposed in this work. Data generated from various test cases are fed to one‐dimensional CNN for high‐level feature extraction. After that, an efficient classifier tool XGBoost is used to properly discriminate different transformer internal faults against outside abnormalities. A portion of an Indian power system is considered and simulated in PSCAD software using the multi‐run feature to collect a large number of data for various fault/abnormal situations. The generated data are used in MATLAB software where the proposed algorithm is programmed. A high‐performance CPU is used for training and testing purpose of the projected artificial intelligent technique. The obtained results for classification accuracy as well as discrimination time shows that the proposed scheme is competent enough to properly discriminate transformer operational conditions. Further, the combined CNN‐XGBoost technique is compared with existing relevance vector machine and hierarchical ensemble of extreme learning machine classifier techniques. Moreover, a hardware experiment is performed in a laboratory prototype of 50 kVA, 440/220 V transformer to verify the authenticity of the developed protective scheme. After analyzing a variety of experiments, the authors note that the presented method provides promising classification accuracy within a short time period.",
