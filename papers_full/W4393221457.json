Our research explores the use of these tools throughout the entire design and manufacturing \nworkflow. We assess the capabilities of LLMs in various tasks: converting text prompts into designs, \ngenerating design spaces and variations, transforming designs into manufacturing instructions, evaluating \ndesign performance, and searching for designs based on performance metrics.

Introduction\nComputer-aided technologies (CAx), which encompass computational tools for design, analysis, and \nmanufacturing of products, have significantly influenced various industries such as automotive, aerospace, \narchitecture, electronics, biomedical, and digital media. However, the full potential of CAx workflows is often \nhindered by challenges such as the need for extensive domain-specific knowledge and the time required to \nutilize CAx software packages or to integrate these solutions into existing workflows. The advent of generative \nAI, particularly large language models (LLMs), seems poised to help us overcome these obstacles. By \nautomating or semiautomating each stage of the CAx process, LLMs can serve as a software copilot with \nintuitive and user-friendly interfaces such as interactive chats with multimodal inputs. This would streamline \nthe use of CAx tools and integrate them more efficiently into broader workflows.\nOur analysis1 examines the standard CAx workflow to identify opportunities for automation or acceleration \nthrough generative AI methods. We dissect the workflow into five distinct phases, assessing the potential for \nefficiency and quality enhancements in each phase by integrating generative AI tools. The components under \nreview are: (1) generating a design, (2) constructing a design space and design variations, (3) preparing and \ndocumenting designs for manufacturing, (4) evaluating a design’s performance, and (5) discovering high-\nperforming designs within a given performance metric and design space.\n0:000:00\n/ 45:05/ 45:05\n \u0000  L i s t e n  t o  t h i s  a r t i c l e\nAn MIT Exploration of Generative AI • From Novel Chemicals to\nOpera\nLarge Language Models for Design and Manufacturing\n3\nAlthough it would be feasible to create specialized LLMs for CAx, our study highlights the benefits of using \ngeneric, pretrained models. We base our experiments on GPT-4,2 a leading general-purpose LLM, to \ndemonstrate its application in CAx workflows. This approach illustrates how LLMs can streamline and \naccelerate the design and production of complex objects. Our analysis further explores how LLMs can \nintegrate with existing solvers, algorithms, tools, and visualizers to create a cohesive workflow. Additionally, \nwe identify current limitations of LLMs in design and manufacturing, pointing out avenues for future \nenhancements in both the models and the augmented workflows. Finally, we address the ethical considerations \nand dual-use risks associated with these tools, along with potential strategies for mitigation.\n2. Evaluation of Current LLM for Design and Manufacturing\nOur evaluation’s primary goal is to explore the potential and challenges of integrating contemporary LLMs into \nthe CAx workflow. Recognizing that every component of the CAx workflow—from design and design spaces \nto manufacturing instructions, performance metrics, and technical documentation—can be represented as \ncompact programs, we employ LLMs across these diverse tasks. We conceptualize each phase of the CAx \nworkflow as a translation layer, transforming input (which may be natural language or a domain-specific \nlanguage, DSL for short) into an output DSL. Given LLMs’ proficiency in symbolic manipulations, they show \npromise in tackling these tasks, potentially enhancing our traditional methods. Our investigation covers each \nstage of the design and manufacturing process, including design generation from natural language, design \nspace creation, design for manufacturing, performance prediction, and inverse design.\n2.1 Generating Designs from Natural Language Specifications\nWe evaluate the ability of LLMs to create designs from natural language instructions, spanning various design \ncontexts such as individual parts, hierarchical assemblies, and hybrid designs that integrate existing \ncomponents. The LLM demonstrates proficiency in generating designs from high-level textual input, \neffectively handling a diverse range of representations and problem domains. For instance, we assess the \nLLM’s capability using OpenJSCAD,3 an open source JavaScript-based CAD library. In every scenario, the \nLLM successfully generates coherent and well-structured code, complete with semantically meaningful \nvariables and comments. It also shows skill in interpreting and completing underspecified prompts by inferring \nand supplying plausible values for missing parameters. An example of this is asking the LLM to design a \nsimple cabinet with a shelf, as depicted in Figure 1. While conducting our experiments, we note some common \nchallenges the LLM faces in generating designs in OpenJSCAD. However, it effectively rectifies most of these \nissues upon user guidance.\nAn MIT Exploration of Generative AI • From Novel Chemicals to\nOpera\nLarge Language Models for Design and Manufacturing\n4\nTo test the limits of LLM-driven design, we asked the LLM to design a functional quadcopter, which requires \nthe integration of prebuilt elements such as motors, propellers, and batteries. After sourcing these components, \nthe challenge lies in designing a frame that accommodates their dimensions. We assigned this task to an LLM, \nfocusing primarily on the frame design to securely hold the selected components. The initial frame design \nproposed by the LLM was impractical, as it was directly attached to the motor cylinder and lacked adequate \nsupport for components like the battery, controller, and signal receiver. With minor adjustments, the LLM \nrefined the design to a practical version. This final design was then subjected to further evaluation in a \nsimulator or under real-world conditions, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nFigure 1\nL a r g e  l a n g u a g e  m o d e l ’ s  ( L L M )  c a b i n e t  d e s i g n  p r o c e s s .

This capability for iterative design is particularly beneficial for constructing complex structures. \nUsers can begin with a simple prompt and gradually increase complexity to achieve the desired outcome. The \nLLM excels in incorporating modules and hierarchical structures through natural language, showcasing its skill \nin managing high-level structure and discrete composition. It reliably creates accurate primitives in various \ndesign languages. Additionally, the LLM’s output is characterized by its readability and maintainability. The \ngenerated code features descriptive variable names, helpful comments, and proper modularity. Users also have \nthe option to request custom hierarchical refactoring, which aligns well with the preferences of human \nprogrammers and designers.\n2.2 Design Spaces via Natural Language and Extrapolation\nA design space encompasses a range of potential designs. A common approach to creating a design space is \nthrough parametric designs, where design parameters may be continuous or discrete. However, having a \nparametric design alone is insufficient for exploring different design variations, either manually or \nautomatically. It is essential to determine specific values for the design parameters. This can be achieved by \nsetting lower and upper bounds for each parameter, allowing each to take any value within these limits. A \ndesign space, therefore, is defined by the parametric design combined with these parameter bounds, \nrepresenting the entire set of possible design variations.\nFigure 2\nA  q u a d c o p t e r  d e s i g n e d  w i t h  t h e  a i d  o f  a  l a r g e  l a n g u a g e  m o d e l .

To \nensure the generation of good parametric designs, we instruct the LLM to use high-level design parameters and \nminimize the number of variables. Interestingly, the LLM often introduces additional variables for readability \non its own initiative, even without specific instructions. We have observed that incorporating these guidelines \ninto our prompts consistently leads to the creation of parametric designs. Alongside this, establishing parameter \nbounds is crucial for defining a design space. When prompted for lower and upper bounds, the LLM suggests \nvalues based on the typical proportions of the object being designed. Although the absolute scale is arbitrary, \nthe proposed bounds are semantically reasonable and proportionate to each other.\nWe also explored the LLM's capacity to infer a parametric design space from a specific preexisting design \nprovided by the user. The input designs for the LLM are provided in a text-based DSL such as OpenJSCAD, \nwith varying degrees of semantic annotations and explanatory comments. Enriching LLM inputs with more \nsemantic information noticeably enhances the quality of the resulting design space. For instance, including the \nname of the object being modeled in the design proves beneficial for generating a parametric design. This \napproach reveals design parameters that are semantically more relevant for altering the design, as illustrated in \nFigure 3. We find that the LLM’s extensive semantic knowledge base can be utilized to generate parameters, \nbounds, and constraints not only for text-based designs but also for preexisting designs, as shown in Figure 4.\nAn MIT Exploration of Generative AI • From Novel Chemicals to\nOpera\nLarge Language Models for Design and Manufacturing\n7\nFigure 3\nS e m a n t i c  c u e s  f o r  c h a i r  d e s i g n  p a r a m e t e r s .

However, for more substantial structural modifications, designers might consider combining \nelements from two or more designs within the same object class. This process of design interpolation presents \nits own challenges. To test the LLM’s capabilities in this area, we presented it with designs of a bicycle and a \nquad bike, which differ in wheel number and fork construction. The bicycle has a fork encasing the wheel, \nwhile the quad bike’s wheels attach to the frame with horizontal bars. Tasked with designing a tricycle, the \nLLM successfully determined the appropriate wheel arrangement and adapted the quad bike’s frame for wheel \nalignment. However, it did not fully incorporate the bicycle’s fork design, suggesting room for improvement \nwith additional user guidance (Figure 5). This experiment highlights the LLM’s potential in merging design \nconcepts and coding proficiency. We observe that the LLM can interpolate existing designs by extracting and \nadapting subdesigns based on their program representations. Interestingly, even when designs are not presented \nin a modular fashion, it tries to recognize and abstract submodules in input designs.\nFigure 4\nM u g  d e s i g n  p a r a m e t e r  b o u n d s  a n d  c o n s t r a i n t s .

To test the LLM’s effectiveness in this area, we conducted an \nexperiment. We provided the LLM with a parametric design of a Lego brick and tasked it to define parameter \nbounds and constraints. Subsequently, we asked it to generate ten different parameter settings for viable Lego \nbricks, each with a unique name, as illustrated in Figure 6. The LLM successfully adhered to the established \nbounds and constraints, resulting in distinct 3D models with plausible names. These outcomes suggest that \nLLMs can efficiently identify semantically meaningful design variations within a given design space.\nFigure 5\nB i k e  d e s i g n  i n t e r p o l a t i o n .

They serve as a repository of manufacturing expertise, \nleveraging their pattern recognition and language interpretation capabilities during the design and \nmanufacturing phases. Additionally, LLMs’ programming skills and text pattern analysis enable them to \ngenerate and modify design and manufacturing files. Traditionally, DfM has depended on human expertise and \nCAD software to review and adapt designs for better manufacturability. By integrating LLMs into this \nworkflow, the DfM process could become more streamlined, leading to more consistent, scalable, and efficient \ndecision-making processes.\nWe outline several ways in which this new manufacturing expertise bank, as represented by LLMs, can be \napplied in design and manufacturing (refer to Figure 7). First, the LLM can be used to identify the most \nsuitable manufacturing techniques for a part, based on its specific features. Additionally, it can suggest and \napply design modifications to enhance manufacturability, thereby streamlining production processes. This \nFigure 6\nL e g o  d e s i g n  s p a c e  e x p l o r a t i o n .

Lastly, the LLM could \nassist in creating manufacturing instructions for various processes.\nTo assess the LLM’s proficiency in selecting the best manufacturing processes, we conducted a test involving \nfour different cases. Each case featured variations in geometry, material, tolerance, and quantity, described \nusing an OpenJSCAD file. The LLM’s task was to determine the most suitable manufacturing process based on \npredefined priorities. In some cases, we intentionally limited the options to evaluate the LLM’s decision-\nmaking under constraints. The objective was to gauge the accuracy of the LLM in aligning its choices with the \nspecified priorities. In three of the cases, the LLM’s selections were deemed optimal by an expert reviewer. \nHowever, in the remaining case, its recommended process was inappropriate for the given material. Initially, \nthe LLM presented a range of options, necessitating additional prompts to identify the most appropriate choice.\nWe evaluated the LLM’s ability to optimize manufacturing designs by inputting a CNC machining project into \nthe LLM using an OpenJSCAD file. The project involved a 10-inch diameter disk with bolt holes and a central \nblind square pocket. The LLM identified manufacturing complexities and adjusted the OpenJSCAD \nspecification to address them. Although the LLM initially misunderstood some geometric features, it correctly \nidentified several issues. Following corrections, the LLM addressed the concerns with the part’s size and \nmachining area. In the final phase of the project, the LLM improved the wall thickness and adjusted the radius \nof the internal pocket for more efficient machining with a 1/4\" endmill.\nBy drawing on extensive datasets, LLMs possess specialized knowledge in part manufacturing, which enables \nthem to accurately identify part names and describe their function. In designing a quadcopter, we initially \nrequested a comprehensive parts list from the LLM, including items like batteries, frames, and propellers \n(Figure 8). The response was both thorough and precise. Seeking further details, we asked for numerical \nspecifications for components like batteries, and the LLM provided realistic estimates. Depending on the \ndesign requirements, whether for a heavy-duty copter or an indoor model, the LLM recommended appropriate \nFigure 7\nI n t e g r a t i o n  o f  a  l a r g e  l a n g u a g e  m o d e l  ( L L M )  i n t o  d e s i g n  f o r  m a n u f a c t u r i n g  ( D f M ) :  A n  L L M  c a n  \nb e  u s e d  t o  a u g m e n t  t h e  D f M  P r o c e s s  w h e n  d e s i g n i n g  a  p a r t .\nAn MIT Exploration of Generative AI • From Novel Chemicals to\nOpera\nLarge Language Models for Design and Manufacturing\n12\nparts. However, specific requests for particular part names or manufacturers sometimes led to incompatible or \nnonexistent part suggestions. Through iterative questioning, the accuracy of these suggestions improved. \nAlthough the LLM faced challenges in generating precise, fully compatible parts lists, it excelled in offering \nbroad, relevant suggestions and advice on part compatibility. The LLM proved valuable for domain-specific \nknowledge and in creating detailed parts lists, but it remains prudent to verify exact numbers and specifications \nindependently.\nFigure 8\nW e  i l l u s t r a t e  t h e  u s e  o f  t h e  l a r g e  l a n g u a g e  m o d e l  ( L L M )  t o  g e n e r a t e  a  p a r t s  l i s t  f o r  a  c o p t e r  \nf r o m  A m a z o n .

It serves as a crucial link between digital \ndesign and physical manufacturing by automating tasks such as planning and toolpath generation. CAM \nenhances production efficiency, accuracy, and communication. In this context, we explored the use of LLMs in \nconjunction with open source CAM software to create both machine-readable and human-readable \nmanufacturing instructions.\nAdditive design, essential in 3D printing, typically involves complex spatial reasoning and multiple design \niterations. We posit that LLMs can simplify this process by comprehending intricate specifications, creating \ndesigns, simulating results, and devising innovative solutions that improve both functionality and aesthetics. \nOur method consists of two phases. Initially, we translate the concept from natural language into an \nintermediate 3D shape using triangle meshes. Subsequently, this shape is converted into G-code, suitable for \nspecific 3D printing hardware. This conversion, requiring deep knowledge of fabrication processes, is \nfacilitated using Slic3r,4 a professional G-code generation software, integrated with Python for optimal G-code \noutput. The LLM plays a crucial role in ensuring effective communication throughout these stages, fostering a \nsmooth flow of data and instructions. This LLM-augmented process aims to enhance the efficiency and quality \nof additive manufacturing outcomes.\nWe also conducted an experiment to explore the potential of LLMs for generating assembly instructions that \nare human and machine-readable as standard operating procedures. Our experiment involved assembling a \nwooden box, using a specified set of tools and materials. As shown in Figure 9, we asked the LLM to generate \nhuman and machine-readable instructions, which involves creating a set of functions to specify different tasks \nand generating corresponding sequences to execute those tasks. The LLM’s output details system-agnostic \nactions for a robot to perform. We then instructed the LLM to convert these machine-readable instructions into \na comprehensive, human-readable standard operating procedure. This procedure offers a step-by-step guide to \nthe assembly process, making it easy for human operators to understand and follow. The aim was to evaluate \nthe LLM’s ability to bridge communication between robots and humans in assembly tasks, by generating \ninstructions that cater to both.\nAn MIT Exploration of Generative AI • From Novel Chemicals to\nOpera\nLarge Language Models for Design and Manufacturing\n14\nFigure 9\nI n s t r u c t i o n s  f o r  a s s e m b l i n g  a  w o o d e n  b o x  u s i n g  s p e c i f i c  t o o l s  a n d  d i m e n s i o n s .

The \nevaluation can focus on a single criterion or multiple criteria to determine if the design meets specific \nrequirements. Results of this assessment can range from a single number to a spectrum of outcomes. More \ncomplex evaluations involve comparing different designs for optimization or final production decisions. These \nevaluations include objective, semi-subjective, and subjective criteria. Objective criteria are measurable \nfeatures such as weight, size, load capacity, impact resistance, speed, battery life, vibration resistance, and \nprice. Semisubjective criteria require some level of insight or estimation, including ergonomics, product \nlifespan, sustainability, portability, safety, and accessibility, which may vary based on the evaluator or context. \nSubjective criteria depend heavily on the evaluator’s perspective, covering aspects like comfort, aesthetics, \ncustomer satisfaction, novelty, and perceived value.\nIn the engineering design process, after creating a design or design space, key geometric features like size, \nweight, and strength are typically evaluated to ensure the design’s functionality. We demonstrate this process \nusing a quadcopter as an example. We input the quadcopter’s specifications into the LLM, including battery \ndetails, weight, and dimensions. The LLM is then tasked with generating functions to assess hover time, travel \ndistance, and velocity/acceleration. It uses these inputs to calculate the inertia tensor, voltage–torque \nrelationships, and other kinematic and dynamic factors. Furthermore, the LLM determines essential physical \nparameters for these calculations, such as maximum thrust, battery capacity, aerodynamic properties, control \nsystem efficiency, payload, environmental conditions, and operational constraints. This case study not only \nillustrates the LLM’s capability in conducting detailed evaluations but also highlights its ability to recommend \nappropriate products, such as specific batteries from a particular vendor, for the quadcopter.\nThe LLM is capable of suggesting design considerations and metrics with a high degree of sophistication. It \nremains effective even when handling ambiguous requests, missing details, or complex performance metrics, \nconsistently producing reasonable first-order approximation functions. Typically, the evaluation functions \ngenerated by the LLM are functional and free of coding errors. The LLM has demonstrated the ability to assess \nevery property we tested. In instances where errors occur, additional questioning and interaction help refine the \ncode, leading to improvements in the output.\nThe evaluation of subjective properties, which heavily rely on lexical input, presents an interesting challenge \nfor LLMs. To test the LLM’s ability to assess subjective criteria based on abstract input parameters, we tasked \nit with creating a list of key sustainability criteria and then evaluating chair designs against these criteria, \nscoring each category from one to ten. In this test case, we fed the LLM text from product pages, including \neach chair’s name, design description, material, appearance, and some quantitative data like dimensions, \nweight, and cost, as shown in Figure 10. When asked to provide sustainability scores, the LLM generated \nreasonable numbers, offering justifications based on the text descriptions. Additionally, the LLM demonstrated \nAn MIT Exploration of Generative AI • From Novel Chemicals to\nOpera\nLarge Language Models for Design and Manufacturing\n16\nits capacity to categorize items and rank a set of designs, even without providing explicit intermediate \nevaluations.\n2.5 Inverse Design\nAlthough generative AI algorithms can produce design candidates, they do not inherently assure high \nperformance for these candidates. Inverse design aims to create designs that are as close to optimal as possible \nwithin certain constraints. Specifically, given a design space and performance metrics (which may include \noptimization targets or constraints), inverse design addresses this question: Which design within our space \noffers the best performance without breaching any constraints?\nWhile LLMs are not inherently capable of independently searching for optimal solutions to novel problems, \nthey can provide educated initial guesses and generate optimization code for users to execute. Consequently, \nwe concentrated our efforts on using LLMs to create effective code for problems, taking into account factors \nlike parameterization support (e.g., continuous vs. discrete domains), the nature of performance objectives, and \nfabrication constraints. In this scenario, we explore the potential of LLMs in proposing strategies that could \nalleviate some of the common challenges engineers face in the optimization process.\nWe explore whether the LLM can generate a practical cost function and an optimized design when given an \nexample design, a parameterized design space, and a textual objective description. An example of this \nFigure 10\nE v a l u a t i o n  o f  c h a i r  a e s t h e t i c s .

Initially, we provide the LLM with a parametric cabinet design in OpenJSCAD, \nincluding parameter bounds. We then instruct it to create functions for calculating the cabinet’s volume and \nmaterial costs. After confirming the accuracy of these functions, the LLM is tasked to produce a Python script. \nThis script is designed to minimize material costs while adhering to the specified volume constraint. The script \nand its results, including renders of the optimized cabinet, are displayed in Figure 11 and Figure 12.\nAn MIT Exploration of Generative AI • From Novel Chemicals to\nOpera\nLarge Language Models for Design and Manufacturing\n18\nFigure 11\nO p t i m i z i n g  m a t e r i a l  c o s t  o f  c a b i n e t  w i t h  r e s p e c t  t o  v o l u m e .

Its strengths include selecting suitable design optimization \nalgorithms for a variety of problems and rationalizing these choices. Additionally, LLMs can independently \ngenerate code for critical aspects of problem formulation, such as choosing parameters, establishing parameter \nranges, and defining objective functions. This capability significantly reduces the routine workload in setting \nup problems, including establishing loose bounds and essential constraints. Even in less-than-ideal scenarios, \nthe LLM serves as a useful aid, providing a robust foundation for tackling inverse problems.\n3. Gaps in Using Generative AI for Design and Manufacturing and \nPotential Solutions\nGenerative AI techniques have the potential to establish efficient design and manufacturing workflows. \nHowever, after thoroughly assessing the current capabilities of LLMs across various tests, we have also \nidentified several limitations. In this section, we outline these key constraints and offer potential solutions to \naddress them.\nReasoning Challenges: LLMs struggle with analytical reasoning and complex computations, which are crucial \nin design and manufacturing. This often leads to challenges like limited spatial reasoning capabilities. One way \nto mitigate these issues is through the implementation of domain-specific languages. Common in computer \nscience, DSLs encapsulate recurring knowledge, rules, and abstractions, effectively bridging knowledge gaps. \nIt would also be helpful to leverage APIs capable of handling complex computations. LLMs’ ability to create \nFigure 12\nS i n g l e  o b j e c t i v e  w i t h  c o n s t r a i n t  o p t i m i z a t i o n .

To address this beyond human \noversight, automated verification can be implemented using APIs that perform checks and validations. \nUtilizing LLMs’ iterative strengths, it may be beneficial to establish a feedback loop that continues until a \nsatisfactory solution is achieved.\nScalability: When faced with larger or more intricate tasks, LLMs’ performance can deteriorate, often due to \ndifficulties in handling multiple tasks at once. To overcome this, it is effective to decompose large tasks into \nsmaller, manageable subtasks. For example, instead of asking the tool to assess multiple performance metrics \nat once, it is more practical to evaluate them separately. To construct complex models, it is advantageous to \nadopt an incremental design approach in which each component is individually designed and verified before \nintegrating them into the final model. LLMs’ ability to support modularity can be leveraged to construct \ncomplex models step-by-step, following a series of instructions.\nIterative Editing: When modifications are required in a design, specifying these changes directly to the LLM \noften leads to unsatisfactory results. The issue arises because the LLM, upon receiving a prompt for changes, \ntends to regenerate the entire design, neglecting details from previous prompts. This complicates the process of \nediting designs. To address this, one approach is to incorporate all prompts into a single, comprehensive \nspecification, though this method can be problematic due to the scalability issues mentioned earlier. An \nalternative solution is to adopt explicit modularization, allowing for individual parts to be designed and reused \nseparately, which can lead to more effective and manageable design changes.\nContext Information: LLMs are heavily reliant on the presence of detailed context information, and its \nperformance dramatically improves with the addition of more comprehensive domain descriptions. The LLM’s \nability to provide context for its actions makes it particularly valuable in sequential workflows. This feature is \nadvantageous when integrating LLM-generated content into subsequent tasks, as these tasks can leverage the \ncontextual information provided in the outputs from earlier tasks. However, there are potential downsides: \ninsufficient context provision by the user, or the user’s desire to create unconventional designs, can lead to \nchallenges if the LLM is unable to move beyond its inherent biases related to a specific domain.\nUnprompted Responses: LLMs frequently infer unspecified details in prompts, either by autocompleting \nspecifications or making decisions based on limited information. This capability is intriguing in design \ncontexts, as it allows for the completion of partial specifications. However, this proactivity can sometimes be \nexcessive, steering the design process in certain directions and potentially limiting creativity.\nAn MIT Exploration of Generative AI • From Novel Chemicals to\nOpera\nLarge Language Models for Design and Manufacturing\n21\n4. Ethical and Dual-Use Risks and Mitigation Strategies\nThe use of LLMs in the field of design and manufacturing offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency, \nprecision, and innovation. However, it also raises several ethical and dual-use risks.\nJob Displacement: Development of software copilots for design and manufacturing can lead to job \ndisplacement, impacting the livelihoods of professionals in these fields. Tasks that once required human \nexpertise, such as drafting, modeling, analysis, and preparing design documentation, will increasingly be \nautomated using copilots. This change could potentially decrease the demand for skilled labor in design and \nmanufacturing. We believe that a significant investment in education and training is necessary to adapt the \nexisting workforce to using the new generative AI workflows.\nIntellectual Property: Developing LLMs relies on existing data and designs. If training datasets include \npatented designs, their use could infringe existing intellectual property (IP) rights. This raises concerns about \nthe originality of the generated output using these new tools. For example, generated designs might replicate \nelements of preexisting designs. Furthermore, the use of LLMs might raise questions about the ownership of \nthe generated designs: is the owner the designer, the creator of the AI tools, or the creator of the designs that \nare used to develop LLMs? The use of design and manufacturing copilots could lead to challenges to the \ncurrent IP law.\nDual-Use Nature and Potential Military Applications: Automated design and manufacturing tools greatly \nreduce the knowledge barrier for creating intricate systems, but they also pose potential risks when misused for \ncreating prohibited items. These tools could expedite the development of advanced military assets, like \nprecision weaponry and unmanned systems (e.g., drones and robots). The rapid production of such military \nequipment can offer substantial strategic advantages. Consequently, there is a pressing need for strong \nregulatory frameworks, international collaboration to deter misuse, and a strong emphasis on ethical \nconsiderations throughout the development and deployment of these technologies.\nDesign Data Privacy and Security. LLMs have the capability to replicate sensitive and proprietary design \ndata used in model creation. Protecting the security and privacy of this data is a paramount concern, given its \nhighly sensitive nature. Unauthorized access to such data can result in substantial competitive disadvantages \nand financial losses. Additionally, if the training data is compromised or tampered with, it could potentially \nresult in flawed new designs and manufacturing processes. As LLM systems gain popularity, addressing \nprivacy and security issues associated with them becomes increasingly vital. This necessitates the development \nof a comprehensive strategy to implement robust cybersecurity measures.\nDesign Reliability and Accountability: Utilizing LLM tools for design and manufacturing introduces the \npossibility of products with design or safety deficiencies. Consequently, it is crucial not to place undue trust in \nthese tools. Establishing an accountability process for designs and manufactured products is imperative. For \nAn MIT Exploration of Generative AI • From Novel Chemicals to\nOpera\nLarge Language Models for Design and Manufacturing\n22\ninstance, when the tool operates as a copilot, human experts should retain the ultimate responsibility for \nverifying and approving the design.\nLimited Access to Tools: Due to significant development expenses and limited training datasets, it is \nconceivable that generative AI tools for design and manufacturing may only be accessible to large enterprises. \nThis scenario is expected to exacerbate the gap in design and manufacturing capabilities between small \nbusinesses and large corporations.\n5. Conclusions\nWe find that LLMs possess numerous capabilities that can be leveraged within the domain of design and \nmanufacturing. This area, where creativity converges with practicality, presents exciting opportunities for \nadvancements that can potentially bring about a significant shift in the way we ideate, prototype, and \nmanufacture a broad range of products. However, it is essential to recognize that substantial work remains to be \ndone to fully support the integration of these tools within this field. A fundamental issue is that design for \nmanufacturing involves a delicate balance between creativity and formal verification. Engineering design \npresents a paradox; it requires precision and exactness, yet thrives on an iterative and exploratory spirit. While \nour experiments have managed to circumvent the LLMs’ limitations for formal reasoning through user \nguidance, DSL crafting, and external APIs for complex computations, there is still much to understand about \nhow best to implement these strategies. Similarly, in terms of workflow development, we have observed a \nmyriad of possibilities. One approach would divide problems into parts that can be tackled by LLMs and others \nthat are best solved by traditional methods; another approach boasts iterative solutions; and yet another \nsuggests a complete reframing of the problem by asking the LLM to generate problem-solving code. Each of \nthese approaches carries potential advantages and disadvantages. So, what should an optimal framework look \nlike? We hope our evaluation will aid others in formulating an answer to this question.\nOur study also addresses ethical concerns and the dual risks associated with this technology, encompassing job \ndisplacement, intellectual property issues, potential military uses, data privacy and security, accountability, and \nrestricted access to tools. We offer potential mitigation strategies for these risks.\nIn summary, we believe our analysis offers valuable insights into how LLMs can be harnessed in the domain of \ndesign and manufacturing. Although our work has made initial strides, the path to fully leverage the potential \nof these tools in this domain remains open, rich with opportunities for further exploration and innovation.\nBibliography\nMakatura, Liane, Michael Foshey, Bohan Wang, Felix HahnLein, Pingchuan Ma, Bolei Deng, Megan \nTjandrasuwita et al. “How Can Large Language Models Help Humans in Design and Manufacturing?” Preprint \nsubmitted July 25, 2023. https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14377.\nAn MIT Exploration of Generative AI • From Novel Chemicals to\nOpera\nLarge Language Models for Design and Manufacturing\n23\nJSCAD Organization. “JSCAD User Guide.” https://openjscad.xyz/dokuwiki/doku.php.
