This research \nis aimed to establish a database for functional analysis of \ngrinding stones and sickles from the early Neolithic \nPeiligang culture. Controlled experiments are required to \nidentify critical variables (e.g. silica in husks) that affect \nusewear patterns. \nINTRODUCTION \nDistinctive stone tools in Early Neolithic China include \ngrinding stones called mopan (lower grinding stone) and \nmobang (upper grinding stone or handstone) and denticu-\nlate slate sickles  (Figure 1) . It is the subject of ongoing \nresearch to determine the technological variability, func-\ntions and associations of such tools in a variety of archae-\nological settings. However, p revious studies (e.g. Chen \n2002, Liu 2008, Song 1997, Wu 1986) have proposed that \nparticular plant foods may  have been associated with \nthese implements . For example, slate sickles with edge -\nground denticulations may have been used to harvest \ngrain or other produce and the  mopan and mobang may \nhave been used for grinding the harvested food (e.g. grain, \nacorns or other nuts/fruit) prior to cooking . An initial r e-\nsearch objective has been  to evaluate the potential of \nusewear to determine diagnostic patterns associated with \nprocessing different taxonomic classes ( e.g. siliceous c e-\nreal grains vs. nuts). Aspects of this research include: \n Controlled experiments to identify critical vari a-\nbles (e.g. the role of silica in husks) associated \nwith usewear formation. The identification of \nkey variables is important for asses sing overlap-\nping wear patterns and multi -functionality (i.e. \nprocessing more than one kind of food).  \n Replication of prehistoric tool forms (e.g. de n-\nticulate slate sickles) and subsequent tool -use \nexperiments to evaluate whether particular taxa \nwere effectively exploited using a specific tec h-\nnique and to compare usewear on experimental \nand archaeological tools.  \n Integration of  these data with residue studies to \ndetermine the function of specific implements \n(e.g. Liu et al 2010a, b). \nIn this paper we address the first two aspects  with case \nstudies from experimental grinding stone and sickles with \nground-edge denticulations . We summarise usewear pa t-\nterns potentially relevant for distinguishing  prehistoric \nprocessing of Quercus acorns and cereal grain ( Avena \noats and Setaria millet). A particular interest has been to \ninitiate investigation of  multi-functional usewear on \ngrinding stones (i.e. usewear on tools used for processing \nseveral different materials ). In addition we examine us e-\nwear patterns on experimental denticulate sickles used for \nharvesting acorns, reeds and grasses. Grinding tool -use \nexperiments are highly relevant for interpreting the use -\nwear on both implement types. Although these studies are \nincomplete, it is possible to propose hypotheses about the \nnature of overlapping wear patterns on implements used \nfor processing both cereal grain and acorns. \nMETHODS \nIn this study, we used experimental tools for harvesting \nand processing seeds and acorns.  Two sets of tool -use \nexperiments were undertaken . First, we undertook expe r-\niments to replicate usewear on stones used for grinding \nand processing a range of plant materials. Second , we \nmanufactured denticulate sickles and undertook a range of \nexperiments to evaluate their possible use to harvest plant \nresources.  \nSTONE TOOL-USE EXPERIMENTS WITH GRINDING STONES AND DENTICULATE SICKLES \n30 \n \nlower \nhand \nlower \nhand \nlower \nhand \nlower \nhand Hand = Upper grinding stone \nLower = lower grinding stone \nPVS \nPeel XS11 XS18 XS12 XS16 XS13 XS15 XS14 XS17 Notes \nPeel A X X X X X X X X Unused surface \nPeel B X X X X X X X X 15 minutes grinding rock on rock \nPeel C X X?

All \nhandstones (labelled XS15-18, Figure 3) were similar \nmedium-fine grained red -purple sandstone collected at \nHuizui, Henan Province, China  (Webb et al. 2007). Poly-\nSTONE TOOL-USE EXPERIMENTS WITH GRINDING STONES AND DENTICULATE SICKLES \n31 \nvinyl siloxane  (PVS) “peels” provided durable and high \nresolution records of usewear after various phases of use  \n(Tables 1 and 2). \nExperimental l ower grinding stones (labelled XS11-\n14, see Tables 1 and 2) included: \n XS11: medium-grained light brown sandstone \nfrom Horsham, western Victoria, Australia (with \nhandstone XS18), previously unused; \n XS12: medium-grained reddish-brown sandstone \nfrom China, Huizui (with handstone XS 16) , \npreviously unused; \n XS13: coarse-grained felspathic white sandstone \nfrom China, Huizui (with handstone XS 15) , up-\nper surface previously unused; lower surface \npreviously used by Owen (2007) to grind a d o-\nlomite stone spade blank for 8-9 hours; and \n XS14: tuff from China, Zhejiang quarry  (with \nhandstone XS17), previously unused. \nThe experimental grinding stones were used to process \nAvena sp. oats, Setaria sp. millet and Quercus sp. acorns \nto a powder or paste (Figure 4). The acorns were soaked \novernight (Figure 5) before pounding and grinding , in \naccordance with recommended food preparation practices, \nand processed while wet. Water was not added in any \nother experiments. Added water introduces a new usewear \nvariable because water reacts with polishing agents to \nencourage polish development on siliceous surfaces  (Ful-\nlagar 1991) . Water also aids in dispelling dust and grit \nand probably speeds the polishing proc ess (e.g. Owen \n2007). \nPeriodically after each phase of use, experimental slab \nsurfaces were brushed lightly (avoiding formation of new \nusewear) with et hanol to remove residues . PVS “peels” \n(labelled Peel A, Peel B, etc.) were taken as records of  \nmicroscopic usewear  on each upper and lower grinding \nstone during each phase of use (Figures 6 -8). The first \npeel from each grinding stone ( Peel A ) documents the  \nunused surface . Other peels are from  surfaces at various \nlater stages of the experiments (see Tables 1 and 2  be-\nlow). All tools were hand used in one dominant direction \nand the task s were carefully documented and timed (Fi g-\nure 9).  The planned sequence of tasks documents single \nand multiple overlapping usewear patterns. \nTask 1: Experimental grinding of stone on stone \nStone on stone  usewear (see Results below, Figure 10) is \nrecorded on each Peel B (Table 1 ), taken after 15 minutes \nof grinding stone on stone  from the same location as peel \nA. The stone on stone wear provides a basis for compar i-\nson with usewear from various other grinding tasks. \nTask 2: Experimental grinding of Avena oats (with husks) \nThe experimental slab was rotated 90 degrees (to disti n-\nguish striations from the earlier stone on stone wear ), and \neach Peel C (from XS11, XS12, XS13, and XS14 ) was \ntaken after 20 minutes of grinding Avena oats with husks \nattached (Tables 1 and 2). Consequently each peel C re p-\nresents accumulated usewear from st one on stone and \ngrinding oats with husks (Tables 1 and  2). Aqueous resi-\ndue samples were also removed t o recover phytolith and \nstarch residues but these are not discussed further. \nTask 3: Experimental grinding of Setaria millet \nEach Peel E was taken on XS11, XS13 and XS14 after 20 \nminutes of grinding Setaria millet (with husks ) in the \nsame location as Peel C  (Tables 1 and 2). Consequently, \neach Peel E for XS11, XS13 and XS14 has accumulated \nusewear from grinding stone, oats with husks and millet  \nwith no husks  (Table 2) . Peel D from XS12 comes from \nan unused lower surface and Peel E from XS12 doc u-\nments 20  minutes of grinding millet  with no husks only \n(Tables 1 and 2) . Experimental tools XS11 and XS18 \nwere not used after this. \nTask 4: Experimental grinding of Quercus acorns with \nhusks \nPeel F was take n to document unused surface s on experi-\nmental tools XS12 and XS14 (Tables 1 and 2) before Peel \nG was taken from the same location, after 20 minutes of \ngrinding and pounding aged acorns that had been soaked \novernight. However Peel F from XS13 comes from a su r-\nface previously polished (see  Results below, Figure 12) \nfrom grinding a dolomite stone spade for eight hours. Peel \nG from this location on XS13 represents usewear from \ngrinding and pounding aged and soaked acorns (with \nhusks) on this previously used stone grinding surface  (see \nresults, Figure 12 below). \nA further set of PVS peels ( labelled Peel H) was taken \nfrom the same location as Peel G, (except for XS17) be-\ncause moisture from grinding wet acorns caused defective \nrecords on the initial set (Peel G). \nThe PVS peels provide records of various combin a-\ntions of usewear on the different tool stones . The hand-\nstone PVS peels provide records of accumulated usewear \nat the completion of each task  on fresh and previously \nground surfaces.  \nSlate sickle experiments  \nThree experimental sickles (XSK01, XSK02 and XSKO3) \nwere manufactured to replicate the form of prehistoric \ndenticulate sickles. One sickle (XSK04) was manufa c-\ntured without a denticulate edge. Manufacturing and haf t-\ning techniques did not replicate prehistoric tool-use condi-\ntions but were designed to ass ess usewear formation and \nthe effectiveness of the tool design . Sickles were shaped \nfrom locally available (Australian) slate with an angle -\ngrinder ( with abrasive disk) and the denticulations were \nmade with a hand-held metal file. Sickles were hafted in a \nsplit wooden handle and secured with a bolt and wing nut \n(sees Results below, Figures 17, 20 and 23).  \nSTONE TOOL-USE EXPERIMENTS WITH GRINDING STONES AND DENTICULATE SICKLES \n32 \n \nSickle Edge Unused 30 minutes \nacorns \n30 minutes \nreeds \n30 minutes \ngrass \nXSK01 Side A denticulate A C   \nXSK01 Side B denticulate B D   \nXSK02 Side A denticulate A  C  \nXSK02 Side B denticulate B  D  \nXSK03 Side A denticulate A   C \nXSK03 Side B denticulate B   D \nXSK04 Side A plain A   C \nXSK04 Side B plain B   D \nTable 3: PVS Peels from experimental sickles, grouped into tasks. \nAfter each phase of use, experimental sickles were \nbrushed lightly (avoiding formation of new usewear) with \nethanol to remove residues, and sets of PVS peels (l a-\nbelled Peel A, B,  C and D ) were taken as records of m i-\ncroscopic usewear on each experimental sickle. Each Peel \nA is from unused surface A and each Peel B is from u n-\nused surface B (Table 3). Peels C and D were taken from \nthe same location during subsequent phases of use for \neach task (Table 3). \nTask 1: Harvesting Quercus Acorns,  \nThe experimental sickle XSK01 , with a denticulate edge,  \nwas hafted at right angles to a long pole that was drawn \ndown towards the harvester to strip acorns for 30 minutes \n(see Results below, Figure 1 6). The sickle was thus in \ncontact with branches, leaves and acorn parts. It proved \nvery effective in removing acorns efficiently.  \nTask 2: Harvesting Typha reeds  \nThe experimental sickle XSK02 , with a denticulate edge,  \nwas hafted at right angles to a short pole that was used for \n30 minutes t o cut a handful  of reeds  in a slicing motion \ntowards the harvester (See Results below, Figure 19.)  The \nsickle proved very effective in cutting the reeds. \nTask 3: Harvesting Poaceae grass \nThe experimental sickle XSK03 , with a denticulate edge, \nwas hafted at right angles to a short pole that was used for \n30 minutes to cut handfuls of grass in a slicing motion \ntowards the harvester (see Results below, Figure 22). This \nproved to be much more effective than experimental sic k-\nle XSK04, which lacked a denti culate edge. The dentic u-\nlate edge seems essential for the sickle blade to bite effe c-\ntively into the grass stems. Experimental sickle XSK04 \nproved so ineffective that its use was discontinued. \nRESULTS  \nThe results of each experiment were documented and are \nsummarised below. \nGrinding stone experiments  \nAll tools proved effective in processing the harvested \nproducts, although a pounding action was required in or-\nder to  crush the oily acorn kernels both with husks a t-\ntached and after husks had been dislodged. Gri nding \nproved to be a highly effective action for processing the \ncereal grains with or without husks. The preferred mode \nof use (e.g. more pounding than grinding) and properties \nof the seeds and kernels are  probably responsible for di f-\nferential development of striations , which were more \nprevalent from grinding seeds, and pitting , which was \nmore prevalent after pounding acorns. \nGrinding stone on stone is consistent with previous \nwork (e.g. Owen 2007; Cunnar 2007). Dominant usewear \nincludes abundant, relativel y deep striations with angular \ncross-section commonly visible in nearly all microscopic \nfields of view  (Figure 11 , left). Away from crystal faces \nthe striations are still very common and give the surface a \ncorrugated polished appearance. The degree of surf ace \nlevelling and abundance of striations increased with time, \nalthough the corrugated appearance was retained in \npatches (Figure 12, left; Figure 13, left). A notable feature \nis that the lower parts of the topography remain unpo l-\nished. Despite grinding af ter 8 hours , the sandstone was \ncontinuously worn down as sand particles were plucked \nand gouged from the surface . Unlike  tougher rocks like \naltered basalts , commonly used for making axes , the \nsandstone did not  sustain a microscopically smooth d e-\nveloped polish. \nGrinding oats with husks on the previously ground  \nsurface tended to gradually obliterate the coarse and rel a-\ntively deep angular striations produced by the initial rock \non rock grinding. New and f iner striations are introduced \nand are recognised  on ima ges because our experiment \nrotated the orientation of the handstone and grinding stone \nby 90 ° (Figure 12, right ). In addition the surface away \nfrom quartz crystals tends to develop a more reticular (net \nlike) polished surface where the lowest parts of the micro-\ntopography remain noticeably less polished than the high-\ner parts, where there is more friction  with the handstone. \nSTONE TOOL-USE EXPERIMENTS WITH GRINDING STONES AND DENTICULATE SICKLES \n33 \nPhytoliths in husks are likely to introduce a polishing \nagent (in the form of amorphous silica) that enhances \npolish development which would be more marked if water \nwere also added (Fullagar 1991). Without husks the \npolish is less developed. \nAfter grinding oats with husks, use of the same tool to \nfurther grind another grain (millet with  no husks) causes \nfurther surface levelling and more striations in the dire c-\ntion of use, but little further development of polish on the \ntool surface (Figure 13). \nGrinding and pounding acorns produce d noticeable \ndifferences in the type of polished surface. First, the lower \nparts of the micro -topography were much more polished \nthan was sustained by the grinding of seeds  (Figure 14, \nright). Second, striations were markedly less abundant  \nand in fact quite rare except for scratches on quartz cry s-\ntals, unless the surface had been previously ground ( cf. \nFigures 13 and 14) . Third, pitting was more common on \nacorn processing implements (Figure 15, right).  \nThe relative contribution of husks and oil (in acorns  \nand cereal seeds)  to polish formation (perhaps a s lubri-\ncants and polishing agents ) needs further investigation , \nbut mechanical processes are likely to be significant. In \nparticular, the thicker soft acorn kernels undoubtedly \nbuffer the impact of grinding/pounding stones. The rel a-\ntive contribution of pounding as opposed to grinding is \nalso likely to increase the in cidence of pitting associated \nwith acorn processing. \nSlate sickle experiments \nThe experimental sickle XSK04 with no denticulations \nalong the edge proved totally ineffective for cutting reeds, \neliminating this as a likely prehistoric function.  \nAt lower magnification under oblique stereomicr o-\nscopes, there are differences in the degree  and location of \nedge rounding for the three successful harvesting tasks \n(stripping branches for acorns, harvesting grass and cu t-\nting reeds).  Acorn stripping produced massive  rounding \nand smoothing across each tooth of the denticulate edge \nin most contact with braches  (Figure 18 , centre ). The \nsmoothing is associated with polish visible at higher \nmagnification under vertical incident light  (Figure 18, \nright).  \nHarvesting reeds produced less edge rounding visible \nat lower magnification then the other tasks (Figure 21, \ncentre), less levelling and a more uneven micro -\ntopography (Figure 21, right). \nHarvesting grass produced a similar degree of edge \nrounding as stripping acorns, but less levelling or smooth-\ning visible at low magnification (Figure 24, centre) . The \ndegree of polish formation  was also similar (Figure 24 , \nright). Smoothing was less developed on the reed cutting \ntools. Striations were most common on the acorn stri p-\nping tool. \nDespite these variations, small patches of polish in the \nthree harvesting experiments can be  strikingly similar. \nThe extent of polish development on the grass cutting \nsickles may be more extensive and follows surface und u-\nlations; the edge rounding and s moothing may be most \nextensive with acorn stripping. Further work is required to \ninvestigate the nature of polish formation on (relatively) \nsoft rock like slate. Del Bene and Shelley (1979) noted \nthat translocation, cohesive deposition and build -up of \ndebris were noted as dominant mechanisms in ‘polish’ \nformation on soapstone implements (where ‘polish’ in \nthis context is explicitly understood to be an additive la y-\ner).  \nDISCUSSION \nStudies by Dubreuil (2004) identified criteria for discri m-\ninating between vari ous grinding tasks using basalt  im-\nplements. Significant variation visible at low (stereosco p-\nic) and high (SEM) magnification was found in the mor-\nphology of the overall  surface topography and the micro -\ntopography and grain surface modification. Importantly,  \noily vegetable processing produced marked levelling and \nrounding of micro -topographic edges that extended into \nthe ‘valleys’ or low points in the micro -topography. In \ncontrast, processing cereals produced a more rounded \ntopographic features with polished homogenous zones.  \nGrinding ochre produced even more levelling of grains \nand overall flattening of the surface.  These patterns are \nsimilar to grinding on other very tough stones such as \nBanded Ironstone Formation, dolerite, granite and gran o-\nphyres found in northwestern Australia (e.g. Fullagar and \nWallis in press). However, softer sandstones may be un-\nlikely to sustain similar features.  \nThe toughest mineral in sandstone is quartz in the \nform of sand grains of various dimensions cemented in a \nfiner matrix composed of other minerals usually cemented \nby silica, iron oxide and /or carbonates. The sand grains \nthemselves can sustain distinctive usewear and polish as \nhas been found on flaked quartz tools (e.g. Sussman 1988; \nKnutsson 1988; Fullagar 199 1). Grinding of more weakly \ncemented sandstones will cause erosion of the quartz \ngrains and abrasive smoothing that will potentially co n-\nstrain the formation of smoothing and polish develo p-\nment. Hamon (2008)  analysed sandstone for another \nrange of grinding tasks observed with a stereoscopic m i-\ncroscope. These tasks included cereal processing, poun d-\ning and crushing, abrading and polishing , and de-fleshing \nand softening hide.  Notably hard mineral abrasion tends \nto level the whole surface , but various mechanism s, i n-\ncluding the hardness of the sandstone itself, addition of \nwater and sand, and properties of the various materials \nthat were ground,  can account for the degree of levelling. \nAlso notable is the observation that usewear and polish \nmay not develop beyond a certain stage depending on \nhow rapidly grains of sand are plucked or eroded during \nuse. \nSimilar observations were documented in our study , \nalthough we suggest that the degree of overlap between \nusewear patterns on tools used for similar tasks and tools \nused for multiple tasks has been under-estimated.  \nAlthough our  experiments suggest a difference b e-\ntween grinding seeds (like millet and oats) and pounding \nand grinding acorns, the archaeological grinding stones \nand edge-ground tools such as sickles that were used for \nSTONE TOOL-USE EXPERIMENTS WITH GRINDING STONES AND DENTICULATE SICKLES \n34 \nmultiple tasks are likely to have more variable and over-\nlapping wear patterns unless the last episode of use was of \nsufficient duration to obliterate earlier tasks.  \nProcessing other kinds of fruit , nuts, vegetables  and \nseeds with a wider range  of biochemical and mechanical \nproperties is likely to indicate even more overlap in wear \npatterns, although it may well prove possible to discrim i-\nnate between  larger softe r kernels and smaller harder \nseeds.  \nResidue analysis is  therefore crucial for identifying \ntaxonomic detail , although interpreting those residues is \nalso complicated. We do not discuss these problems fu r-\nther, but one of us,  Sheahan Bestel, has found that reco v-\nered phytoliths on experimental sickles do not necessarily \nmatch the harves ted species ! The latter is presumably \ncaused either by contamination or by deposition  of phyto-\nliths from others species at the harvest locations. \nCONCLUSIONS \nProcessing acorns or cereal grains can be distinguished on \nthe basis of  distinctive usewear on san dstone grinding \nimplements. Distinctive features probably relate to the \nmode of use (grinding vs. pounding), properties of the \nsandstone (e.g. strength of cementation and grain size), \npolishing agents (e.g. amorphous silica content of the \nplants, or phytoliths) as well as the  stone, moisture co n-\ntent and other variables (e.g. the amount of pressure or \nforce applied).  \nHarvesting acorns, grass and reeds produce d less dis-\ntinctive usewear on hafted denticulate slate sickles  than \nwhat is visible on grinding ston es. Further experiments \nare required to control for the different actions , locations \nof maximum force and  the usewear distribution on the \nimplements. \nOverlapping wear patterns from multiple uses are \nproblematic and residues are needed to identify details o f \nprocessed materials. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis paper was presented at the 19TH CONGRESS OF THE \nINDO-PACIFIC PREHISTORY ASSOCIATION (29th Novem-\nber - 5th December 2009), at the Vietnam Academy of Social \nSciences Conference Centre, Hanoi, Vietnam.
