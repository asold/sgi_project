These\nresults indicate a need for tools that assess Ca and/or dairy intake in adults to be\nrigorously tested for reliability and validity.\nKeywords\nDairy\nCalcium\nDietary assessment\nAdults\nThe health beneﬁts of consuming dairy foods, a major\nsource of Ca(1), are well documented in the scienti ﬁc\nliterature(2,3). Adequate intake across the life cycle is bene-\nﬁcial for the control of blood pressure(2), reduction in cardio-\nvascular mortality(4) and reduced risk of osteoporosis(5).\nDespite the importance of an adequate Ca intake, evidence\nconsistently demonstrates that many individuals, and parti-\nc u l a r l yw o m e n ,h a v ed i fﬁculty achieving dietary dairy/Ca\nrecommendations\n(6– 9). National survey data from Australia,\nthe UK and the USA report mean daily intakes for adult\nwomen of 663, 682 and 756 mg, respectively, and for\nmen of 827, 860 and 962 mg, respectively, compared with\nan estimated average requirement of 840 to 1100 mg/d\ndepending on age\n(10).\nIn order to identify those at risk of suboptimal Ca intake\nin Western populations it is necessary to accurately assess\ndairy/Ca intake. Traditional methods of dietary assessment\n(24 h recalls, food records) are burdensome and/or costly\nto administer as a screening tool for application at either\nthe population or individual clinical level(11). Thus an ideal\nmethod would be a short, easy-to-administer tool. A key\ncriterion that supports the use of a tool in practice and\nresearch is relative validity, or its ability to accurately\nmeasure what it purports to measure, determined by how\nclosely the results match those of a reference test\n(12,13).\nIdeally, validity is tested using sensitivity (the ability of\na test to correctly identify true positives) and speciﬁcity\n(the ability of a test to correctly identify true negatives);\nor when using continuous data a measure of agreement\nsuch as Bland– Altman analysis\n(13). Tools should also have\ngood reliability such that they produce consistent results\nwhen performed under similar circumstances, either over\ndifferent time points or when conducted by different\nresearchers\n(13).\nThe present paper is the second of two reviews with the\noverall aims to: (i) identify published tools that estimate dairy\nPublic Health Nutrition: 18(7), 1225–1236 doi:10.1017/S1368980014001633\n*Corresponding author: Email anthea.magarey@ﬂinders.edu.au © The Authors 2014\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980014001633 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nand/or Ca intake and allow classiﬁcation of individuals\naccording to whether intake requirements are met or not;\nand (ii) assess the testing of tool properties in order to\nrecommend a tool(s) for use. Theﬁrst paper focusing on\ntools for children and adolescents is published\n(14).T h ec u r -\nrent paper focuses on tools developed for use with adults.\nMethods\nA comprehensive search was completed to identify existing\ntools that measure dairy and/or Ca intake. The search was\nconducted using the databases MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid,\nInformit and Web of Knowledge, with the keywords‘cal-\ncium’, ‘dairy’, ‘milk’, ‘diet’, ‘nutrition’ and ‘food’, combined\nwith ‘tool’, ‘questionnaire’, ‘FFQ’, ‘survey’, ‘measurement’,\n‘assessment’, ‘evaluation’ and ‘analysis’. The search was not\nlimited by dates, but databases were searched from their year\nof inception, the earliest being 1948 in the case of MEDLINE,\nto February 2013. The search waslimited to English-language\npapers only. In addition to this search strategy, an identical\nsearch was conducted in Google Scholar to identify any\nrelevant tools or papers in the grey literature. Additional arti-\ncles were identiﬁed by searching the reference lists of the\narticles found in the database searches.\nThe database searches identiﬁed 1113 articles which\nreduced to 1022 when duplicates were removed. These\nwere screened for relevance, resulting in the identiﬁcation of\n121 potentially relevant articles. This was followed by\na second screening phase which identiﬁed forty-eight articles\nthat met the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Arti-\ncles that discussed (i) developing or testing the reliability or\nvalidity of a previously unpublished tool to measure dairy\nand/or Ca intake, (ii) testing the reliability or validity of an\nexisting tool to measure dairy and/or Ca intake and (iii) tools\nintended for use in Western populations, were included\nfor review. Articles that (i) referred to tools that did not\nassess dairy or Ca intake, (ii) utilised existing tools but did\nnot test these for reliability or validity in the study sample,\n(iii) measured dairy and/or Ca intake in non-Western\ncountries (due to differences in the major food sources of\nCa), (iv) utilised traditional whole of diet methods such as\n24 h recalls, food records or diet histories to measure dietary\nintake, (v) were not in English or (vi) were published\nabstracts only, were excluded from review. Two authors\n(K.M., L.B.) sorted the articles independently for relevance\nand where disagreement arose a third author (M.M.) pro-\nvided input. Where controversyremained, the relevance of\nthe article was discussed and aﬁnal decision made regarding\ninclusion. A third andﬁnal screening phase identiﬁed the\narticles as referring to tools developed for or tested with\nadults (n 30) or children/adolescents (n\n18).\nTools described in the articles were classiﬁed as (i) dairy\nassessment tools that assess the quantity or frequency of\nintake of dairy foods or (ii) Ca assessment tools that assess\nquantity or are able to classify respondents into speciﬁc\ncategories of Ca intake. Some tools collected information\non intake of dairy foods and other Ca-containing foods\nand were considered to be both Ca and dairy assess-\nment tools.\nWhen assessing reliability and validity of tools, a sample\nsize of at least 100 subjects was considered acceptable\n(11),\ntests of association (correlation coefﬁcients) were considered\nweak statistical analysis, whereas tests that measured agree-\nment (Bland– Altman orκ) and/or sensitivity and speciﬁcity\nwere considered to provide strong systematic analysis\n(15).A\nmean difference between two administrations or between\ntest and reference method of 100 mg (representing about\n10 % of the recommended daily intake, or one-third\nof a serving of dairy products) was considered clinically\nsigniﬁcant. Further aκ value >0·5 was considered moderate\nagreement, a value>0·7 as good agreement and a value\n>0·8a sv e r yg o o da g r e e m e n t\n(15).\nResults\nThe thirty articles report on thirty-six tools that had been used\nin those aged 18 years or over. Four articles report on two\ntools\n(16– 19), one article reports on three tools(20), and another\nreports on what is assumed an online and paper version of\nthe same tool but this is not clearly stated\n(21).T w ot o o l s(17,22)\na r ee a c hr e p o r t e di ns e c o n da r t i c l e s(23,24). Four tools assess\nboth dairy and Ca intake(16,25– 27) and thirty-two assess Ca\nintake alone. Details of each of the tools are provided in\nTable 1. The tools were used in a range of population groups\nof differing age, gender, race, menopausal status, living\nsituation, educational status and disease state.\nTool characteristics\nAll tools used an FFQ, with varying response options\ncovering a variable period. Nineteen tools were\nquantitative\n(16– 18,20,22,23,26– 35) allowing an estimate of milli-\ngrams of Ca, ﬁfteen semi-quantitative (19– 21,36– 44) and\ntwo qualitative (i.e. frequency of intake of speci ﬁed\nitems)(25,45). Quantitative tools allowed varying serving\nsizes, the semi-quantitative tools provided a standard\nserving size and the qualitative tools included dairy pro-\nducts and other foods that make important contributions\nto Ca intake. In terms of food coverage, all tools included\ndairy products and nineteen included other foods that\nmake an important contribution to Ca intake. One tool was\ndesigned to assess several nutrients and the foods inclu-\nded reﬂected this\n(45). The remaining tools were general\nFFQ that were tested for their ability to assess Ca intake.\nTwo tools were completed via computer(21,30) and most\ncould be self-administered (31/36). Visual aids were\nprovided with ﬁve tools to assist respondents to identify\nportion size and quantify foods. Six tools were reported\nto take less than 15 min to complete, demonstrating an\nadequate user-friendliness and efﬁciency. Time to com-\nplete was not provided for most tools, but where sufﬁcient\n1226 A Magarey et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980014001633 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 1 Summary and key features of studies describing dairy and/or calcium assessment tools utilised in adult populations\nAuthor (year), country\nTool purpose: number of items;\ntool type; population, age Food coverage\nTime required to\ncomplete Application\nAngbratt and Möller D+Ca:8, Ca:52; Q-FFQ; 20 – 30 D+Ca: milk, cheese, Ca tablets, vit/min tablets D: NR, est. <5 min Self-administered.

Most\ntools required computer analysis or professional assistance\nto determine total daily Ca intake and/or adequacy;\nhowever, a few tools were able to provide an immediate\nindication of daily Ca intake.\nTool reliability\nTest– retest reliability was reported for only six tools, two\nwere dairy/Ca tools and four were Ca tools (Table 2). Inter-\nrater reliability was tested for one Ca tool\n(45).T h es t a t i s t i c a l\nanalyses varied, with correlation (Pearson, Spearman or\nintra-class) the most frequently used test. One study reported\na κ value within a range for all nutrients tested\n(45) and\nanother used cross-classiﬁcation(27). The tools were mostly\ntested in samples of less than 100 with only two tools tested\nin a sample of 100 or greater\n(24,36). The period between the\ntwo administrations of the tool varied from a minimum of\n4d\n(45) up to 1 year(27), with most being 2– 3 weeks.\nWelten et al. provided the most comprehensive range of\ntests and these suggested moderate to good reliability (mean\ndifference of 80 mg Ca, Pearson’s correlation of 0·78, exact\nagreement of 62·1 % and gross misclassiﬁcation of 3·4% )(27).\nMiller et al. had comparable moderate intra-class correlation\nvalues across the two versions of their FFQ (thirty-ﬁve-item\nand ﬁfteen-item; r =0·5a n dr = 0·6, respectively)(24) but did\nnot report anyﬁndings from additional tests. The other three\nstudies testing reliability reported only correlations and these\nwere moderate to high. Inter-rater reliability tested by Beck\net al.u s i n gt h eκ statistic showed a good level of agreement\n(κ =0·81 to 0·88)\n(45).\nTool validity\nTwenty-six articles reported tests of relative validity, on\nfour dairy/Ca tools(16,25– 27) and thirty-four Ca tools (Table 3),\nusing an array of common reference methods. Sixteen studies\nused an estimated food record ranging in length from 3 to 14\nd, three studies used multiple 24 h recalls, two used a general\nFFQ, two used diet histories and two used a single 24 h recall.\nThe sample sizes of the studies varied greatly, ranging from\nﬁfteen subjects\n(33) to 2414 subjects(43) with 12/26 having\na sample size less than 100. A range of statistical tests were\nperformed, including correlation, comparison of mean\nvalues, Bland– Altman analysis, agreement usingκ, cross-\nclassiﬁcation and assessment of sensitivity and speciﬁcity\n(Table 3). While correlation values may be moderate\nto high, this analysis tests only association. Ideally tool\nvalidity should be assessed by tests of agreement such as\nsensitivity and speciﬁcity, the κ statistic or Bland– Altman\nanalysis\n(15).\nThe four dairy/Ca tools identiﬁed in the present review\nwere tested for relative validity. Two reported non-\nsigniﬁcant mean differences between the tool and refer-\nence method of less than 100 mg Ca\n(16,26) but reported no\nother tests. Only Weltenet al. conducted higher-level tests\nTable 2 Details of reliability testing of tools that assess dairy and/or calcium intake in adults\nStatistical tests\nAuthor (year), country Tool Population Period Paired t test\nCorrelation: Pearson, transformed Pearson, Spearman,\nintra-class correlation Cross-classification; κ\nGans et al.

However, results of the Bland– Altman\nanalysis conducted in the same study indicated only 52 %\nexact agreement and very wide limits of agreement\n(±1000 mg) indicating that this tool would not perform\nwell at the individual level\n(27).\nA majority of the Ca tools (22/26) were tested for\nrelative validity. Virtually all studies reported correlation\nbetween the tool and reference method, withﬁve studies\nreporting no additional tests(18,19,28,32,36). Due to the limi-\nted value of correlation tests no further discussion of\nthese results is provided although values are reported in\nTable 3.\nSensitivity and speci ﬁcity were calculated by seven\nstudies\n(17,31,34,37,41,44,45) (Table 3). While sensitivity values\nranged from 71 %(37) to 95 %(45), speciﬁcity ranged from\n46 %(17) to 97 %(45). Ideally both the sensitivity and speci-\nﬁcity for a screening tool would be high; however, only\ntwo studies reported both sensitivity and speciﬁcity to be\ngreater than 80 %(31,45).\nCross-classiﬁcation statistics, which identiﬁed the per-\ncentage of subjects correctly classiﬁed by the tool into\nquartiles or tertiles of Ca intake, were reported by eight\nstudies(23,27,30,33,38,39,40,43)(Table 3). Osowskiet al.r e p o r t e d\nthe lowest correct classi ﬁcation of only 33% (39) while\nSevero et al. reported the highest agreement between\nmethods of 89%(43). Gross misclassiﬁcation, deﬁned as\nclassiﬁcation of Ca intake by the tool in the opposite\nquartile or tertile of intake, ranged from 0 % as reported by\nPritchard et al.\n(33) to 8 % reported by Matthyset al.(30).\nThree studies calculated the κ statistic for the level\nof agreement between the two methods, Matthys et al.\nreported κ = 0·20(30), Pasco et al. reported κ = 0·40(40) and\nSevero et al. reported κ = 0·75(43).\nA greater number of studies used Bland– Altman plots to\nillustrate the level of agreement (17,20,21,31,33,37,40,41,43,44).\nThe mean bias between the tool and reference method\nranged from + 5 mg/d\n(17) to + 576 mg/d(33). Limits of agree-\nment varied widely between studies extending from\n± 233 mg\n(31) to ± 1254 mg(33).\nDiscussion\nThe present review identiﬁed thirty papers using thirty-six\ntools that met the criteria for inclusion; four tools that\nassessed both dairy and Ca intake and thirty-two that\nassessed Ca intake only. Based on the review of methods\nused and results of the reliability and validity testing, one\ntool for assessing dairy and Ca intake\n(27) and ﬁve tools for\nassessing Ca intake are recommended(17,20,21,31,43)(Table 4).\nWhile appropriate testing methods for relative validity and\nadequate levels of sensitivity, speci ﬁcity and/or agree-\nment were reported for these tools, only two\n(17,27) were\ntested for test– retest reliability which was shown to be\nmoderate(24,27).\nThe common limitations of the testing of tool properties\nwere the lack of testing for reliability, the high reliance on\ncorrelation which assesses association only, and the lack\nof tests that provide a measure of agreement. In addition\nwhen assessing validity it is important to determine a\nclinically meaningful level of signiﬁcance as opposed to\nrelying on statistical signiﬁcance alone. None of the papers\ndeﬁned a level of clinical signiﬁcance at which the results\nwere meaningful in terms of dietary adequacy. This lack of\nrecognition between statistically and clinically signiﬁcant\nresults limits conclusions relevant to clinical practice. In\norder to deﬁne clinically meaningful results we applied\nTable 4Final recommendations for dairy and/or calcium tools that are well validated for implementation in the practice and research setting\nin adults\nAuthor Recommended population Tool Potential limiting factors\nDairy\n1 Welten et al.(27)* Y oung adults (13 – 27 years)\nGroup settings only\nDairy questionnaire Recall bias\nSmall sample size in reliability study\nResults indicate only moderate reliability and\nvalidity\nCalcium\n1 Montomoli et al.\n(31) Across all adults Ca FFQ Not tested for reliability\nSampling bias\n2 Hacker-Thompson\net al.(21)\nGroup settings only Online\nquestionnaire\nNot tested for reliability\nNo limits of agreement reported\n3 Clover et al.(17) Only validated in the\nelderly, >65 years\nGroup settings only\n35- or 15-item FFQ Recall bias\n4 Sebring et al.(20) Group settings only Short Ca\nquestionnaire\n(Ca:124 and\nCa:25 only)\nNot tested for reliability\nNo limits of agreement reported\nRecall bias\n5 Severo et al.(43) Across all adults 3-item Ca FFQ Recall bias\nNot tested for reliability\n*Also tested for reliability.\n† Tested for reliability in the study by Milleret al.

In addition,\nrelative validity results for those tools that assessed Ca\nvary such that some should be considered with caution\nwhile others appear to have acceptable levels of agree-\nment and/or sensitivity and speciﬁcity. With respect to Ca\ntools, those that appear to be best in levels of relative\nvalidity are those developed by Clover et al.\n(17), Mon-\ntomoli et al .(31), Hacker-Thompson et al .(21), Sebring\net al.(20) and Severo et al.(43). Each of these studies\nincluded a minimum of 100 participants, considered to be\nthe smallest acceptable sample size for a validation\nstudy\n(11), had a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of > 80 %, or a\nBland– Altman mean bias of < 100 mg, or a κ statistic\n> 0·80, or a correct classiﬁcation of> 80 %. One exception\nis that Clover et al. reported a speciﬁcity of <80 %, but\nimportantly this was the only one of theseﬁve tools that\nwas tested for reliability(24).\nThere are some additional limitations to the ﬁndings\npresented here, in particular the quality of the study design.\nThe key study design criteria include level of evidence,\npotential sources of error and bias, and sample size. These\nhave been discussed in the companion paper and the\nissues identiﬁed there equally apply to the adult studies in\nthe current paper\n(14). In brief, all eligible papers were\nidentiﬁed as having III-2 level of evidence, as deﬁned\nby the National Health and Medical Research Council\nevidence hierarchy for diagnostic accuracy(46),a n dt h e r e\nwas potential for recall bias, positive respondent bias and\nrecruitment bias. Many of the studies reported here targeted\nspeciﬁc populations and thus when selecting a tool for use\nit is important to consider the population in which the tool\nproperties were tested. Validity in one population does not\nguarantee validity in another population of different age,\ngender or physiological state.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, based on the present review we recom-\nmend one tool for assessing dairy and Ca intake andﬁve\ntools for assessing Ca intake. However, these should be\nconsidered cautiously as there are inherent limitations to\nall the reported studies suggesting they may not perform\nas well if tested using a study design of a higher level and\nthis should be considered in future application of the tool.\nFurther, when selecting a tool for use the relevance of the\ntool items to the food culture of the target population\nshould be considered. The present literature review has\nidentiﬁed gaps in the literature which may inform future\nresearch. Overall few tools were tested for reliability;\ntherefore further research should be conducted to ensure\nthat other Ca or dairy tools are adequately reliable for use.\nAcknowledgements\nFinancial support: This review was supported by Dairy\nAustralia Inc.
