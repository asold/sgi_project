More precisely, we move to change\nwhat we perceive in a specific way. Sometimes such intended perceptual changes relate to the\nbody itself. For example, when exercising or pantomiming, a person may just aim to move the\nbody in a certain way, and observe her- or himself doing so. In most cases, though, humans\naim to change the environment beyond their own body, such as when transporting an object\nfrom one place to another, or opening a door that was closed a moment before.\nBody movements typically come with various perceptual changes for obvious reasons. All\nbody-external changes are produced by some body movement, which inevitably goes along\nwith some body-related perceptual changes as well. For example, when transporting an object\nfrom one place to another the actor not only perceives the movement of the object itself but he\nor she also sees and feels the movement of the corresponding effector bringing this object\nmovement about. William James termed these inevitable perceptual changes “resident” effects\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 1 / 16\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Liesner M, Kunde W (2020) Suppression\nof mutually incompatible propriocepti ve and visual\naction effects in tool use.

This publication was also\nsupported by the Open Access Publication Fund of\nthe University of Wuerzbu rg (https://w ww.\nbibliothek.u ni-wuerzbur g.de/forsche n-publizieren/\nopen-access /publikations fonds/). The funders had\nof body movements [1]. Second, many of our body movements consistently produce changes\nin the environment, even when actors might not specifically aim to produce such body-exter-\nnal changes. For example, exercising in the sunlight naturally produces a corresponding move-\nment of the shadow of the moving body, although the movement of the shadow was not the\nreason for moving. James called these body-external perceptual consequences “remote” move-\nment effects [1]. It should be noted that other authors sometimes use different labels for these\neffects such as, for example, “body-related” vs. “body-external”, “proximal” vs. “distal” or\n“internal” vs. “external” with sometimes slightly different meanings and connotations. We\nchose here to stick with William James’ terminology because it reflects the crucial difference\nbetween the effects we studied here: namely, effects “residing” in or on the biological body and\neffects, which are “remote” and thus detached from the biological body.\nGiven the variety of perceptual changes that come with any given body movement, the\nquestion arises which of these changes should be mentally represented and attended to when it\ncomes to generate and monitor such movements (representational weight) [2–4]. At first\nglance, there is no obvious reason to take into account and attend at all a certain resident effect\nwhen aiming at a certain remote effect, or conversely, to take into account and attend a certain\nremote effect when just aiming at a certain resident effect. Not attending, or “neglecting”, cur-\nrently task-irrelevant movement effects, might be particularly important when remote and res-\nident effects are mutually inconsistent to each other. For example, when you turn your\ncomputer mouse upside down and try to move the cursor from left to right, it is best to focus\non this intended remote effect and to neglect that the hand has to move, and of course feels\ndoing so, from right to left. Not “neglecting” the spatially inconsistent movement of the hand\nin such a situation can in fact create all kinds of performance costs [5–12].\nThere is evidence for “haptic neglect” [13] in case of such inconsistencies between resident\nand remote movement effects [14–17]. In one study [16] participants had to trace a dot per-\nforming circle movements on a screen with a cursor by moving their hand which was occluded\nfrom vision on a plane tablet in front of the screen. Crucially, the participants’ hand move-\nments were not transformed into identical movements of the cursor. Instead, to produce circu-\nlar cursor movements elliptic hand movements with either horizontal or vertical deviations\nfrom the “standard” circle were required. After every trial, participants had to indicate whether\nthey believed they had drawn horizontal or vertical ellipses. The results showed that even with\nlarge deviations (with x-y ratios between 1:1.29 and 1:1.86 depending on conditions), partici-\npants could not reliably judge the orientation of the ellipses anymore. Moreover, haptic neglect\nseems to actually facilitate performance when there are spatial inconsistencies between propri-\noceptive and visual movement consequences.\nAnother instance where this occurs is mirror drawing, where participants have to copy a\ndrawing but can only see a mirror image of their hand. Here a felt movement of the hand to\nthe right produces a visual image of the hand moving to the left. Interestingly both, partici-\npants with permanently removed body perception (i.e. deafferented patients [18]) or tran-\nsiently reduced body perception (because of rTMS over somatosensory cortex [19]),\noutperform neurotypical participants. Of course, it is unlikely that resident effects are ignored\ncompletely when performing a tool task given their high biological importance. For example, a\nperson operating a tool should still notice when his or her hand is approaching a hot stove or\nbumping into another object. Indeed, it could be shown that despite focusing attention on the\neffective end of a tool, some attention still remains on the body part controlling the tool [20].\nFurthermore, the previously mentioned performance costs when resident and remote effects\nare inconsistent [5–12] could not occur if people would always engage in “full” haptic neglect.\nNevertheless, there is accumulating evidence for haptic neglect when producing remote\nobject movements that are spatially incompatible to movements of an operating body effector\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 2 / 16\nno role in study design, data collection and\nanalysis, decision to publish, or prepara tion of the\nmanuscript.\nCompeting interests : The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nwhile the possibility of the opposite mechanism, an attenuation of conflicting remote object\nmovements and conversely a focus of attention on the resident action effects has sparsely been\nconsidered so far. We are aware of two studies doing so. In one study [21] participants were\nasked to move their occluded hand to the left or right, which then foreseeably produced a\nmovement of a cursor on a screen in either the same or the opposite direction. The response\ntime increase for generating hand movements, which produced opposite rather than same\nmovements of the cursor were reduced, though not abolished when participants were asked to\nignore rather than attend to the cursor movement. This finding suggests some instruction-\nbased control over the degree of processing remote movement effects in the course of generat-\ning a movement prior to actual movement execution though it also shows that even when\nasked to ignore visual action effects, these must still be attended to some degree.\nAnother study suggests that increased task-relevance of resident effects (and decreased\nimportance of the remote effects) prompts attenuation of processing visual information after\nmovement execution [9]. In this study, participants had to estimate the position of their visu-\nally occluded hand after performing hand movements that were transformed into either spa-\ntially compatible or spatially incompatible cursor movements on a screen. The usual finding in\nsuch paradigms is that spatial judgments of body effector and external object are biased\ntowards each other suggesting an integration of the two to a certain degree (spatial binding,\ne.g. [22]). The results of this study showed an absence of this spatial binding effect when hand\nmovements were transformed into spatially incompatible cursor movements, which accords\nwith the idea that the representation of the visual, remote action component (the cursor) was\ngiven less weight in the incompatible conditions when participants were asked about their pro-\nprioceptive, resident effects.\nTo summarize, it has frequently been shown that incompatibility, for example in movement\ndirection, of a controlled object and the effective body part controlling that object leads to per-\nformance deficits because of the conflicting associated effect codes [6–12]. The idea of neglect-\ning or suppressing one of the two conflicting components to reduce these difficulties seems a\nplausible assumption. Previous research has mainly argued in favor of a haptic neglect of the\nresident effects in such situations and a coding of one’s actions mainly through remote codes.\nSuch haptic neglect renders position estimates of body effectors less accurate and biased\ntowards the position of a controlled remote object [13–16]. Haptic neglect appears functional\nin most tool-use tasks because it relates to a component of movement feedback that is of lim-\nited task relevance and thus it might be the “default” state when dealing with a spatially dis-\ncrepant tool. Thus, it seems plausible that when operating a tool to produce a certain remote\neffect, which also produces an incompatible resident effect, one might focus one’s attention\nmainly on the remote effect to decrease the impact of conflicting sensory information and of\ndivided attention. Recent research suggests though, that an increase of the relevance of resident\naction effects might lead to a reversal of this imbalance in perceptual precision [9]. This raises\nthe question whether it is the nature of resident action effects per se or their reduced task-rele-\nvance that renders it subject to such neglect.\nBoth approaches suggest that when performing an action, which produces mutually incom-\npatible resident and remote effects, one of these effects might be suppressed or attended to less\nand the other one might be enhanced or attended to more to reduce the conflict emerging\nfrom the anticipation and observation of these interfering action effects. Previous studies have\nsuggested that resident effects are the ones that might be more prone to be suppressed in such\nsituations [14–17]. Possible reasons for this are, for example, that such haptic neglect helps to\nmaintain a feeling of control over the tool and flexibly adapt to new situations [16] or that the\nsaliency of the visual, remote effects might make a coding and attending of actions through\nremote effects more likely than through resident effects [23]. Furthermore, it has been shown\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 3 / 16\nthat visual feedback plays an important role when learning visuomotor transformations, thus\nstressing the importance of remote effects when they are spatially discrepant to resident effects\n[24]. These findings might suggest a general bias towards perceiving remote effects relatively\nunaltered and neglecting resident effects whenever they are interfering. However, one factor\nwhich has never been investigated in a controlled fashion to our knowledge, though its impor-\ntance has been noticed [e.g., 16], is the factor of task relevance of the remote effects in situa-\ntions commonly studied. When operating a remote tool (e.g., when putting a nail in a wall\nwith a hammer), the effects on that tool are obviously more relevant for achieving the task\nthan the resident effects on the body so they should obviously also be in the focus of attention\nof the acting individual. Distinguishing these factors might seem artificial since tools are\nalmost always used to achieve a certain distal effect, which is thus task-relevant. However,\nother examples (e.g. the shadow example from the beginning) show that the relevance of resi-\ndent and remote effects can indeed vary in other real-world contexts. Additionally this differ-\nentiation would give interesting insights into motor planning processes.\nWith this study, we aimed to show that both, remote action effects and resident effects can\nbe equally neglected to overcome potential interference between them. Specifically, we manip-\nulated the compatibility between resident and remote effects and their task-relevance indepen-\ndently (for details see Procedure and task). We expected that the precision of sensory\ninformation decreases with decreasing task-relevance of the respective effect component. This\ndecrease of perceptual accuracy would indicate the “neglect” of the respectively less relevant\neffect component, i.e. a shift of attention away from this component. This would be an eco-\nnomic way of processing only the more relevant perceptual information to a larger extent\ngiven the observed division of attention between resident and remote effects in past research\n[20, 21, 25]. More importantly, we expected the decline of perceptual precision for the less rele-\nvant effect component to be more pronounced when resident and remote effects were incom-\npatible because the contradiction of visual and proprioceptive effects should boost the\nnecessity for this representational weighting mechanism. This would support the idea that\nneglect of one effect component, preferably the less relevant one, is involved in resolving inter-\nference between conflicting remote and resident effect components.\nMaterials and methods\nEthics statement\nThe project was approved by the ethics committee of the Institute for Psychology of the Uni-\nversity of Wu ¨ rzburg under the reference number GZEK 2018–33. All procedures were in line\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki.\nParticipants\n30 participants were tested and received 20 € for their participation. The number of partici-\npants was limited by laboratory capacities. Participants were recruited through an online plat-\nform used by the University of Wu ¨ rzburg and gave informed consent prior to the experiment.\nDue to the relatively long testing sessions (~ 120–135 minutes), four participants decided to\ncancel the testing before completion. Another two participants had to be excluded due to tech-\nnical malfunctioning so that the final sample of participants consisted of 24 participants (all\nright-handed; 18 female, 6 male; M\nAge\n= 25.67, SD\nAge\n= 4.43, min\nAge\n= 20, max\nAge\n= 33). All par-\nticipants had normal or corrected to normal sight and did not report any relevant medical\nconditions.\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 4 / 16\nApparatus and stimuli\nThe experimental set-up is depicted in Fig 1. The apparatus consisted of a graphics tablet (Intuous\n4 XL, Wacom, Kazo, Saitama, Japan) which was horizontally fixated on a table and an iron con-\nstruction around the tablet holding a semi-silvered mirror approximately 26.9 cm above the tablet\nand a 24” LCD screen facing down on the mirror approximately 48.4 cm above the tablet. Fur-\nthermore, the computer keyboard was placed left of the construction. The experimental proce-\ndures were programmed using Eprime (version 2.0, https://www.pstnet.com/). Because the\nmonitor was slightly larger than the graphics tablet, the projection area of the monitor was\nadjusted so that it resembled the measures of the tablet to ensure that the screen image was pro-\njected onto the mirror which gave the impression for participants that a screen of just the same\nsize and dimensions as the tablet was mounted above the tablet. One pixel was approximately 0.25\nx 0.25 mm\n2\nin size. Participants were seated in front of the construction and were instructed to\nlean their forehead against the upper part of the construction facing down at the mirror. Addi-\ntional black cardboard prevented vision of the computer screen. Participants placed their right\nhand between the tablet and the mirror and were able to operate the tablet with a digitizing stylus.\nThey were instructed to place their left hand left of the construction so that they were able to oper-\nate the keyboard with it. Because vision of the keyboard was hindered due to the set-up, all rele-\nvant keys for the experiment (arrow keys, space bar, return key) had little soft markers attached to\nthem so that they could be easily identified without vision. To ensure that participants could not\nsee their hand on the tablet through the mirror, all testing was carried out in a darkened room.\nProcedure and task\nEach trial included the following steps for the participants (also depicted in Fig 2). First, partic-\nipants had to move a red cursor (a dot approximately 0.5 mm in diameter) controlled with the\nFig 1. Experimenta l set-up as used in the study.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0242327.g0 01\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 5 / 16\nstylus to the center of the screen, which was marked by another green dot equal in size. After a\nshort random delay (1000 ms or 2000 ms, counterbalanced across all conditions), a beep tone\n(50 ms, 2000 Hz) was played as a start signal and the green dot started moving in one out of\nfour directions (up, right, down, left) chosen randomly in a straight line of a length chosen ran-\ndomly within a range of 12.5–37.5 mm with a constant speed of 0.5 mm per frame. After this\ndistance was covered by the dot, the experiment generated another random segment in one\nout of the four directions and within the same range. This procedure was repeated until a\nnumber of segments between 5 and 15 was reached. Again, also number of segments was\ndetermined on a random basis within this range in every trial. This procedure resulted in the\ngreen dot moving on the screen continuously taking several 90˚ or 180˚ turns for about 30 s\nper trial. Throughout the whole dot movement phase, the participants’ task was to follow the\ngreen dot as accurately as possible with the cursor by moving the stylus on the tablet. If the dis-\ntance (measured as Euclidean distance) between the green dot and the cursor exceeded 10\nmm, an error message was shown and the trial was repeated. During the last segment of every\ntrial, another short tone (50 ms, 500 Hz) indicated that the trial was about to end after this\nsegment.\nAfter the last segment had ended, both the green dot and the red cursor disappeared and\nparticipants had to move the stylus back to the center of the tablet as marked by a blue dot.\nAfter the center had been approached and an additional delay of 500 ms, the second, judgment\nphase of the trial started in which participants were asked to estimate either the position of the\nred cursor or the position of the stylus at the moment when the second tone occurred which\nhad signaled the end of the trial. In cursor judgment trials, the red cursor appeared on the\nscreen again and it had to be moved to the estimated position by the participants by using the\narrow keys of the keyboard with their left hand and confirming their judgment with the return\nkey. In stylus judgment trials, no cursor was shown but the participants were simply asked to\nmove the stylus back to the estimated position and confirm their judgment by pressing a key\non the stylus. After one of the two judgments had been made, the next trial started.\nThe experiment was split into four blocks, which differed in the way the participants’ move-\nments of the stylus were transformed into movements of the cursor and in the ratio of stylus\njudgment and cursor judgment trials (see Table 1). In compatible blocks, the cursor always\nFig 2. (A) Trial structure of the experime nt.

(B) Hand-curs or moveme nt transformat ions in the\ncompat ible (left) and incompati ble (right) conditions.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0242327.g0 02\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 6 / 16\nmoved in the same direction as the participant moved their hand, thus a movement of the\nhand to the left caused a cursor movement to the left, an upwards hand movement caused an\nupwards cursor movement etc. In incompatible blocks, the direction of cursor movements was\nalways inverted both in the x and in the y direction compared to the hand movements. Thus, a\nhand movement to the left caused a cursor movement to the right, an upwards hand move-\nment caused a downwards cursor movement etc. Furthermore, the blocks differed in terms of\nthe frequency of cursor and stylus judgments. In mainly proprioceptive blocks, 80% of the judg-\nments that had to be made were stylus judgments and only 20% were cursor judgments\nwhereas in mainly visual blocks this proportion was the other way round. Please note that the\norder of judgments in a given block was still randomized so that only the ratio, but not the\nsequence of certain judgments could be predicted. Additionally, there were no explicit instruc-\ntions for the participants regarding the judgment ratios. The manipulations of compatibility\nand judgment ratio were combined leading to the blocks compatible x mainly proprioceptive,\ncompatible x mainly visual, incompatible x mainly proprioceptive and incompatible x mainly\nvisual (see Table 1). Participants always either completed both compatible or both incompati-\nble blocks first before experiencing the second movement transformation and furthermore\nunderwent short practice blocks (8 trials) before both the compatible and incompatible half of\nthe experiment. In these practice blocks, the percentage of cursor judgments and hand judg-\nments was 50% each. Whether participants first performed the compatible or incompatible\nblocks and order of judgment ratio blocks within the compatible and incompatible blocks was\ncounterbalanced between participants.\nFurthermore, we varied the time point of the occurrence of the tone signalizing the end of\nthe trial. The tone could occur either when the cursor was still 2.25–2.5 mm away from the end of\nthe last segment (we will refer to that from now on as very late), when it was 4.75–5 mm away\nfrom the end of the last segment (late), when it was 7.25–7.5 mm away from the end of the last\nsegment (early) or when it was 9.75–10 mm away from the end of the last segment (very early).\nWe varied this time point to prevent participants from developing strategies for their judgments,\nwhich they could possibly do if the continuation of the movement after the tone occurred had\nalways been of the same length. In combination with the variable start delay of either 1000 ms or\n2000 ms which was counterbalanced over all other conditions, participants thus performed 40 tri-\nals per block leading to a total number of 176 trials including practice blocks and plus potential\nadditional trials to replace error trials. Within blocks, trials were randomized.\nData preprocessing\nWe excluded all practice trials and trials in which participants deviated more than 10 mm at\nany time, measured as Euclidian distance, from the green dot they had to track with the cursor.\nFor every trial, we calculated the absolute error of the judgments as the Euclidian distance\nTable 1.

Furthermore, exploratory Bayes Factors were esti-\nmated for all reported main effects and interactions. As expected, absolute errors were larger\nfor the incompatible than for the compatible movement transformation (M\nincompatible\n= 34.81\nmm, SD\nincompatible\n= 23.25 mm; M\ncompatible\n= 20.08 mm, SD\ncompatible\n= 8.92 mm; F(1, 23) =\n18.80, p = .001, η\np\n2\n= .37; BF\n10\n= 1.27 x 10\n13\n) and for the less frequently judged modality than\nfor the more frequently judged one (M\nlow\n= 31.69 mm, SD\nlow\n= 17.82 mm; M\nhigh\n= 23.20 mm,\nSD\nhigh\n= 11.85 mm; F(1, 23) = 28.81, p < .001, η\np\n2\n= .56; BF\n10\n= 2.93 x 10\n3\n).\nThese effects were further modulated by the significant two-way interactions compatibility\nx judgment modality (F(1, 23) = 8.93, p = .007, η\np\n2\n= .28; BF\n10\n= 4.38 x 10\n11\n) and compatibility\nx frequency (F(1, 23) = 4.94, p = .036, η\np\n2\n= .18; BF\n10\n= 0.91) although for the latter one the\nBayes factor suggested inconclusive evidence. Follow-up t-tests for the compatibility x judg-\nment modality interaction indicated that the difference between absolute errors in the compat-\nible and incompatible condition was only significant for proprioceptive but not for visual\njudgments (M\ncompatible x visual\n= 22.16 mm, SD\ncompatible x visual\n= 12.55 mm; M\nincompatible x visual\n=\n24.11 mm, SD\nincompatible x visual\n= 10.82 mm; |t|\nvisual\n< 1; M\ncompatible x proprioceptive\n= 17.92 mm,\nSD\ncompatible x proprioceptive\n= 6.70 mm; M\nincompatible x proprioceptive\n= 45.52 mm, SD\nincompatible x proprioceptive\n=\n42.55 mm; t\nproprioceptive\n(23) = 3.48, p = .002, one-tailed, d\nz\n= .71, adjusted for multiple testing).\nMore importantly, the compatibility x frequency interaction indicated that the observed fre-\nquency effect was larger in the incompatible than in the compatible condition (M\nhigh x compatible\n=\n17.59 mm, SD\nhigh x compatible\n= 8.10 mm; M\nlow x compatible\n= 22.57 mm, SD\nlow x compatible\n= 10.42 mm;\nM\nhigh x incompatible\n= 28.81 mm, SD\nhigh x incompatible\n= 18.47 mm; M\nlow x incompatible\n= 40.82 mm,\nSD\nlow x incompatible\n= 29.07 mm; see Fig 3) though the frequency effects were significant in both\ncompatibility conditions (both t’s > 4.05, both p’s < .001, one-tailed, adjusted for multiple test-\ning). This effect was not further modulated by the three-way interaction compatibility x fre-\nquency x judgment modality (F(1, 23) = 1.20, p = .29, η\np\n2\n= .050; BF\n01\n= 3.88) suggesting that\nthis pattern was independent of the to-be-judged entity. Thus, the results suggest that in the\ncase of incompatible hand and cursor movements, the judgment error is specifically increased\nfor the less frequently judged modality, regardless of whether this is the visual or proprioceptive\nmodality (Fig 4). Neither the main effects of judgment modality and time point of tone nor any\nother interactions reached significance (all ps > .059).\nDue to the relatively low number of trials for estimating the median values for some of the\ncells (especially in the low frequency condition), we also conducted an analysis based on linear\nmixed models (LMMs) which does not require the aggregation over trials like the RM\nANOVA. The results largely confirmed those of the ANOVA with the only difference that the\nmain effect of judgment modality reached significance in the LMM analysis (t = 10.46, p <\n.001). Most importantly though, the fit of the main effects model was improved significantly\nby adding the two-way interaction of compatibility x frequency (χ\n2\n(1) = 5.91, p = .015) and the\nfit of the two-way interaction model was not improved further by adding the three-way inter-\naction of compatibility x frequency x modality (χ\n2\n(2) = 3.06, p = .22). This shows that the\nobserved results were not due to properties of particular analysis methods.\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 8 / 16\nAs an example, Fig 5 shows the judgment data of a typical participant.\nExploratory analyses\nTo assess whether our paradigm is able to trigger a default haptic neglect without making one\nof the two action components more or less task-relevant, we calculated an additional 2 x 2 RM\nANOVA on median absolute errors in the practice trials with the factors judgment modality\n(proprioceptive vs. visual) and compatibility (compatible vs. incompatible). We did not\ninclude the factor time point here because it did not reveal any significant effects in the previ-\nous analysis. We found significant main effects of both factors (modality: F(1, 23) = 7.10, p =\n.014, η\np\n2\n= .27, BF\n10\n= 23.48; compatibilty: F(1, 23) = 17.98, p < .001, η\np\n2\n= .44, BF\n10\n= 397.06),\nbut more importantly also a significant interaction between the two (F(1, 23) = 13.05, p = .001,\nη\np\n2\n= .36, BF\n10\n= 1.59 x 10\n3\n). Follow-up t-tests revealed that this was due to significantly less\nprecise proprioceptive judgments in the incompatible compared to the compatible condition\n(M\ncompatible x proprioceptive\n= 22.46 mm, SD\ncompatible x proprioceptive\n= 8.74 mm; M\nincompatible x proprio-\nceptive\n= 57.88 mm, SD\nincompatible x proprioceptive\n= 40.58 mm; t(23) = 4.86, p < .001, d\nz\n= .99), but\nthat there was no such effect in visual judgments (M\ncompatible x visual\n= 23.71 mm, SD\ncompatible x\nvisual\n= 12.59 mm; M\nincompatible x visual\n= 26.53 mm, SD\nincompatible x visual\n= 25.38 mm; |t| < 1).\nFurthermore, proprioceptive judgments were only less precise than visual ones in the incom-\npatible (t(23) = 3.23, p = .004, d\nz\n= .67), but not in the compatible condition (|t| < 1).\nGeneral discussion\nIn this experiment, we investigated how the task-relevance of resident and remote action\neffects (as manipulated by probability of probing) and level of interference (as manipulated by\nFig 3.

We found that perceptual precision was generally lower for the effects that were\nless likely probed, and when resident and remote effects were incompatible to each other. This\nsuggests that people are generally sensitive to task demands when it comes to shift attention to\neither resident effects of their actions or effects located in a remote, controlled object. Most\nnotably, the drop of judgment accuracy was particularly pronounced for less relevant, incom-\npatible action effect components. This suggests that “neglect” of task-irrelevant effect compo-\nnents might be involved to overcome interference that would otherwise occur by attending to\nthese effect components. Importantly, this occurred both when the cursor position was less\nlikely to be probed indicating the neglect of interfering visual information when propriocep-\ntive judgments were more likely, and when the stylus judgment was less likely to be probed\nFig 4. Mean absolute errors as a function of compatibili ty and frequenc y of the judgment split up for stylus judgmen ts\n(A) and cursor judgments (B). Error bars represent 95% paired-diff erence confiden ce intervals [26].\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0242327.g0 04\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 10 / 16\nindicating the neglect of interfering proprioceptive information (i.e., haptic neglect) when\nvisual judgments were more likely (Figs 3 and 4). The corresponding interaction was signifi-\ncant in the ANOVA and the linear mixed model analyses, while the Bayes analysis yielded\ninconclusive evidence for this interaction. So a higher-powered study of this effect is certainly\ndesirable.\nPrevious studies on tool use have argued that visual attention is focused on the effective end\nof the tool rather than the person’s body movements [16, 17, 20]. The present study however\nshowed that this mechanism is shaped by the relevance of the resident sensations while per-\nforming a tool task. Heuer & Rapp [13] have suggested that interference between action effect\ncomponents is reduced by neglecting proprioceptive information. Here we showed that not\nonly proprioceptive but also remote information can be suppressed to reduce conflict. It is\nthus not the particular nature of proprioceptive action effects that makes them subject of such\nsuppression. Instead, this happens because of their irrelevance in tasks where remote effects,\nsuch as movements of a tool, are the goal of the action [14–16]. In line with previous work [13,\n16], our exploratory analyses also showed that without the upweighting of proprioceptive\ninformation through increased relevance of resident signals these are more likely to be ignored\nor suppressed than remote visual information about the tool when the information from these\nsources is contradictory. One might wonder why the absolute errors were larger with a 50%\nchance of being probed in the practice blocks than in the 20% chance condition in the experi-\nmental blocks. This is most likely due to practice effects with the judgment task. However, this\ninflation in the practice trials should not affect the critical comparisons. In line with these\nexploratory analyses, we also found no general compatibility effect in precision judgments for\nthe visual condition in absence of further manipulations of task-relevance. Both observations\nsuggest that there is no “vision neglect” under normal tool use conditions, which makes sense\ngiven the inherent importance of the tool and its effects for achieving one’s goal when using a\ntool [13, 16]. As laid out before, to invert this tendency proprioceptive information needs to\nbecome more task relevant.\nOur findings thus suggest that despite a “default” tendency to neglect incompatible proprio-\nceptive instead of visual information the mechanisms related to the processing of resident and\nFig 5.

Target and judgmen t positions for all trials were remapped to the upper left quadrant of the screen\nso that data points in the right and lower half of the figure represent judgmen t errors towards the center and data\npoints in the left and upper half of the figure represent judgment errors towards the sides.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0242327.g0 05\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 11 / 16\nremote effects still seem to be more similar than previous studies on tool use suggested. This is\nwell in line with theoretical notions that humans should be very flexible in their way of repre-\nsenting actions either through anticipation and feedback from resident or remote action effects\n[3, 4]. There might be a more general mechanism underlying these observations, related to the\nprocessing of spatially incompatible sensory information of different modalities in general,\nindependent of the stage of movement, or possibly of movements at all. We will come back to\nthis possibility at a later point. To what extent participants are actually aware of these seem-\ningly strategical suppression mechanisms is certainly something to be determined in future\nresearch.\nAs outlined above, the neglect of the less relevant action effects in a given block and the\nmodulation of this through (in)compatibility of resident and remote effects was independent\nof the judgment modality, thus whether visual or proprioceptive estimates had to be made.\nAdditionally though, we also found no significant differences between absolute estimation\nerrors of the two judgment modalities in the experimental blocks which is surprising given the\ncommon finding that people are usually much better in judging visual compared to proprio-\nceptive positions [22, 27–30], though we did find a significant effect of this factor in the explor-\natory single-trial analyses. However, this might be due to the significant crossed judgment\nmodality x compatibility interaction which indicated not only a compatibility effect for the\nproprioceptive judgments, but also that these were both less precise than visual judgments in\nthe incompatible condition, while being more precise than visual judgments in the compatible\ncondition. Conceivably, the surprisingly precise proprioceptive judgments in the compatible\ncondition resulted from moving the stylus back to where it had been during the occurrence of\nthe tone. Thus, participants could have tried to move back from the center position to the esti-\nmated position in more or less the same trajectory in which they moved from the end position\nof the tracking task to the center position. We tried to circumvent this by introducing a delay\nbefore indicating the judgment modality and by varying the time point of the tone; however, it\ncould still be that this experimental characteristic might have led to an advantage for the pro-\nprioceptive judgments, which was not available in the visual judgments. Another possible fac-\ntor might have been that despite the disappearance of the cursor, the neutral center position of\nthe cursor after every trial and the delay before judgments, the location of the visual informa-\ntion might have been more accurately remembered than the location of proprioceptive infor-\nmation [31]. Consequently, the stylus judgments might have been supported by additional\nvisual information to a greater extent than the cursor judgments were supported by additional\nproprioceptive information.\nFurthermore, in compatible trials cursor and hand were always right on top of each other\nthroughout the tracking phase while this was not the case in incompatible trials. Thus, besides\nthe (in)compatibility of the movement directions of hand and cursor, there was also an addi-\ntional spatial discrepancy in the incompatible condition between them which might have addi-\ntionally contributed to the distribution of attention between hand and cursor. As a result, the\npossible additional support of the proprioceptive judgments through visual information in the\ncompatible conditions might have led to an underestimation of both the overall level and the\ncompatibility effect of proprioceptive estimation errors. Nevertheless, such biases would have\nnot affected the previously discussed main findings. On the contrary, that incompatibility\naffected uncertainty about proprioceptive sensations stronger than uncertainty about visual\nsensations, renders the suppression of conflicting visual signals of low task relevance even\nmore remarkable.\nAn important point that should still receive some attention here is our manipulation of\ntask-relevance through the frequency of probing a specific modality in the judgment task.\nWhile the relevance of the sensory modalities for the judgment task is obviously manipulated\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 12 / 16\nby this, the relevance of especially visual information during the tracking task might be more\ndifficult to manipulate. The processing of the visual information from the cursor is essential in\nthe tracking task since the task cannot be fulfilled based on proprioceptive information alone.\nTherefore, one might expect that participants should perform the two tasks as if they were\nindependent of each other and there should be no carryover between the two tasks. However,\nthis would render the judgment task impossible to do above chance performance, because the\nsensory information (visual or proprioceptive) necessary for the position judgment was only\navailable during the tracking task and thus had to be attended and encoded during this task\nalready for the subsequent judgment. Thus, if participants were to adapt to the different move-\nment transformation mappings and the proportion of cursor or hand judgments, they neces-\nsarily had to process this sensory input differently already during the tracking task, which then\nshowed up in the subsequent judgement task.\nWhile it might seem contradictory, that especially visual information could already be sup-\npressed during the tracking task, a way to solve this is to think of neglect of sensory informa-\ntion less in absolute or discrete ways, but rather as a continuous distribution of attentional\nresources between different sensory modalities [3, 4, 32–34]. Participants certainly could not\ncompletely neglect visual information in the less relevant condition because it was still neces-\nsary for the tracking task, nevertheless they might have already shifted away some attention\nfrom the visual information compared to the high relevance condition but leaving still enough\nto perform the tracking task. Thus, the manipulation of task relevance might still also have an\neffect on the degree to which visual information is already neglected in the tracking task,\nthough the impact of the manipulation might have been smaller here than for the propriocep-\ntive information. This might also explain the smaller visual effects in general and the tendency\ntowards neglecting proprioceptive rather than visual information during practice trials and\nwhen leaving out the relevance manipulation. Possibly, this imbalance could be reduced if one\nchose a stronger manipulation of relevance of resident or remote effects already in the tracking\ntask, like for example by making the tracking task dependent on haptic instead of visual guid-\nance. However, this would have essentially undermined the purpose of this study to investigate\nperception of resident and remote effects under different movement transformations in tool\nuse since tool use is characterized by manipulating an external object, in this case, a cursor.\nThus, making the goal of the tracking task directly related to the resident effect itself would\nlead to a conceptually different situation. There might still be other ways to manipulate the rel-\nevance of resident and remote effects and at the same time maintain the nature of the tool use\ntask, which might be worth to be tested in future research, however we believe to have pro-\nvided one possible way to do so.\nDiscrepant sensory input of different modalities might be processed to different degrees\nwithout active movements. Therefore, an experiment similar to ours where locations of mutu-\nally (in)compatible visual and tactile stimulations have to be judged with varying probabilities\nmight reveal similar results, without actively producing that input. Still, tool-use is a real world\nexample where such a situation is inevitably created, while it needs to be studied further\nwhether the active production and passive encounter of such discrepancy matters. Ideo-motor\ntheory [1–3, 35] suggests that it would matter, as mutually incompatible sensory effects of\nmotor patterns create a problem for producing these motor patterns in the first place, which\nadds a reason to suppress one of the two components already during action generation. An\nadditional point that we shortly want to touch is a possible relationship between the two tasks\nand specifically whether differential performance on the tracking task might have influenced\nperformance on the judgment task. While we did not have tracking data to control for this pos-\nsibility, such possible influences could, if at all, only affect the main effect of compatibility in\nthe judgment task. Since our main results however rest on more complex interactions with\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 13 / 16\nthis factor, additional mechanisms, presumably the ones we suggested, have to be at play for\nthese. Actually, since we suggest that these mechanisms are already present during the tracking\ntask, they might also be the reason for possible performance differences in the tracking task\nFurthermore, also the manipulation of time point of the tone that indicated the to-be-\njudged position of either hand or cursor should still receive some attention here. While the\nmain reason for varying this time point was to prevent predictability of the to-be-judged posi-\ntion based on the movement endpoint, in principle this manipulation could have also had an\ninfluence on the absolute estimation error so that it could have made judgments for example\nmore inaccurate, the earlier before the end of the movement it occurred and thus the more\ntime had passed between the tone and the judgment. However, we did not find such an effect,\neither because the spatial judgments were insensitive to this manipulation or because the time\npoints were chosen too close together.\nConclusions\nControlling an external object through one’s own body movements can lead to discrepancies\n(e.g. spatial) between the body effector and the controlled object. Previous research has sug-\ngested that the conflict emerging from this can be overcome or reduced by focusing one’s\nattention on the effects in the object and attending away from one’s body. Implementing a par-\nadigm, which manipulated the relevance of the object on the one hand and of the body on the\nother hand during the task showed that this attentional focus can also be reversed so that the\nbody instead of the object is attended.\nAcknowledgmen ts\nWe want to thank Leonhard Ho ¨ hnel, Ivanna Khandra, and Tim Landgraf for their support\nwith data collection.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: Marvin Liesner, Wilfried Kunde.\nData curation: Marvin Liesner.\nFormal analysis: Marvin Liesner.\nFunding acquisition: Wilfried Kunde.\nInvestigation: Marvin Liesner.\nMethodology: Marvin Liesner.\nProject administration: Wilfried Kunde.\nResources: Wilfried Kunde.\nSoftware: Marvin Liesner.\nSupervision: Wilfried Kunde.\nValidation: Marvin Liesner.\nVisualization: Marvin Liesner.\nWriting – original draft: Marvin Liesner.\nWriting – review & editing: Wilfried Kunde.\nPLOS ONE\nRepresenta tions of propriocepti ve and visual effects\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02423 27 November 18, 2020 14 / 16\nReferences\n1.
