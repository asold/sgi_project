    "abstract": "Abstract ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Bard are highly advanced natural language process–based computer programs (chatbots) that simulate and process human conversation in written or spoken form. Recently released by the company OpenAI, ChatGPT was trained on billions of unknown text elements (tokens) and rapidly gained wide attention for its ability to respond to questions in an articulate manner across a wide range of knowledge domains. These potentially disruptive large language model (LLM) technologies have a broad range of conceivable applications in medicine and medical microbiology. In this opinion article, I describe how chatbot technologies work and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT, GPT-4, and other LLMs for applications in the routine diagnostic laboratory, focusing on various use cases for the pre- to post-analytical process.",
