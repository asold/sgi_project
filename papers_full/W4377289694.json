(2023) have recently published in Nature \na paramount article showing the decline of innovation and \ndisruption in science. The authors analyzed more than 45 \nmillion papers, noticing a substantive change in science \nand technology that reinforces concerns about slowing \ninnovative activity. They attribute this trend partly to \nscientists’ reliance on a narrower set of existing knowledge, \nwith papers increasingly less likely to break with the past \nin ways that push science in new directions. This situation \naligns with a period of normal science, accordingly to the \ndefinition proposed by Kuhn (Matthews, 2022), that we \nmay be experiencing since researchers’ beliefs and practices \nhave become more pragmatic (Morgan, 2007). Given the \ngreater complexity of the present-day phenomena and the \nstructuring of academic careers, among other factors, the \narticle mentioned above seems to herald a period of crisis \nin science, evidenced by stagnation. In this sense, it also \nhighlights the urgency of new proposals for reformulating \nand adapting principles and methods.\nFocusing on business and management research, \nwe believe that scholars may face even more challenging \nsituations in the future. Indeed, society’s transformations \ndemand changes in how managers run firms. T o mention \njust one of the many aspects, such a requirement arises \npartly from stakeholders increasingly adopting a position in \nwhich businesses must contribute to contemporary issues \n(Friede et al., 2015; Scheyvens et al., 2016). However, \nthe decision-making (epistemology) that can lead to this \ncontribution depends on a growing and increasingly \nunstructured volume of data (El-Kassar & Singh, 2019). \nTherefore, management processes and toolboxes may need \nto change for organizations to bring such a desire to fruition \n(Sinkovics et al., 2021).\nThe observed lack of innovation in academic \nproduction combined with ongoing changes in its objects \nof study (businesses) represents one of the most critical \nissues researchers must address. This situation resembles \nthe internet’s early days when a portion of the interaction \namong consumers migrated to virtual spaces for the first \ntime. As a result, a firm’s efforts to gain marketing insights \nsuddenly required analyzing data produced by individuals \non digital platforms (Godes & Mayzlin, 2004). The \nsame circumstances affected management researchers. \nTheir ability to explain consumer behavior also started to \nrequire collecting and analyzing vast amounts of digital \ndata. T raditional interpretive research methods, such as \nethnography, were expanded and adapted to cope with \nthese novel aspects (Kozinets, 2002). \nThis transformation has accelerated in the last few \nyears. The amount and variety of marketing-related digital \ndata have significantly increased (Balducci & Marinova, \n2018). Thus, it does not sound credible to claim that the \nexplosion of new data over the last two decades has not \nlimited management researchers’ ability to observe and \ninterpret relevant marketing information using solely old \napproaches (Berger et al., 2022; Erevelles et al., 2016). \nIn addition, research methods previously adjusted to deal \nwith virtual contexts must be updated again. This time, it \nmay not be possible to merely incorporate the observation \nof new data types while maintaining a position in which \nhuman reasoning is the only thing to rely on (Kozinets et \nal., 2018). Indeed, it may be the case that the fundamental \nnotion of observing a business-related process has to change, \nand such a reconceptualization may require the adoption of \na more participative epistemology (Campagnolo, 2021). \nAligned with the necessity of reflecting on new \nmethodologies, we suggest a potential disruption with \ntraditional methods, blurring the boundaries between \nqualitative and quantitative approaches. We advocate that \nresearch (and researchers) might benefit from an integrated \napproach that uses computational tools to overcome \ntraditional limitations. In this sense, we aim to contribute \nto the contemporary debate on research methods by \nanticipating disruptions, detaching from the present, and \ntrying to understand the contemporary as the result of a \nhistorical process (Bispo, 2022).\nWe structure this paper as follows: in the next section, \nwe outline the current status of the quantitative-qualitative \ndebate. Next, we discuss deep learning language models \nas reading aids in qualitative research. Later, we propose a \nframework to integrate algorithmic artifacts in interpretative \nresearch and briefly discuss how those elements interact in \nsuch a situation. Then we present an actual research case \nusing a language model to scaffold an interpretative research \n“In interpretive research, BERT could potentially be used to analyze and interpret large amounts of text data, such as qualitative \ninterview transcripts or social media posts. It could be used to identify patterns and trends in the data that might not be immediately \napparent to a human researcher, or to generate summaries or extract key themes from the text data ...”\nAnswer given by the chatGPT language model to the question: “Do you believe it is a good idea to use BERT to facilitate interpretive \nresearch?” (December 23, 2022)\nA.

SuarezUsing deep learning language models as scaffolding tools in interpretive research\n2 3\nRevista de Administração Contemporânea, v. 27, n. 3, e230021, 2023 | doi.org/10.1590/1982-7849rac2023230021.en| e-ISSN 1982-7849 | rac.anpad.org.br\neffort. We close the article by discussing its contributions \nand opportunities for future research.\nFuzzies strike back: The quantitative-\nqualitative debate in an era of data \nabundance\nReviving the debate over quantitative versus \nqualitative research near the end of the first quarter of the \ntwenty-first century risks instilling readers with a sense of \nboredom. Indeed, social scientists and philosophers have \ndiscussed this subject with less or more energy for several \ndecades (Bryman, 1984). As a result, the relationship \nbetween these two ways of researching social phenomena \nhas changed over time, going through periods of conflict \nand cooperation (Smith & Heshusius, 1986). A recent \nempirical article demonstrates that commonplace beliefs in \nthe existence of entirely distinct methodological cultures, \nquantitative and qualitative, between which communication \nis supposed to be difficult (Goertz & Mahoney, 2012), are \nsomewhat incorrect (Kuehn & Rohlfing, 2022). \nRapid social change rejuvenates the game field in \nwhich the quantitative-qualitative debate occurs. Social \nscience researchers must all contend with an explosion of \nnew data in terms of volume and heterogeneity as new \ndigital sources provide “rich detail about the evolution of \nsocial relationships across large populations as they unfold” \n(Edelmann et al., 2020, p. 2). Indeed, the unmeasurable was \nturned into measurable by “the technological revolution in \nmobile, web, and internet communications” ( Watts, 2011, \np. 266). Such change “has the potential to revolutionize our \nunderstanding of ourselves and how we interact” ( Watts, \n2011, p. 266), amongst other elements. \nThus, we argue that the societal transformation \ndescribed above fuels discussions and redefinitions about rigor \nin social science research (Sells et al., 1995) for all practical \nmatters. Closed-ended surveys, an example of a popular tool \nin quantitative-deductive inquiry, allow for progressively \nlimited investigations if used alone. Indeed, scholarship \nwork may become more inductive (Grimmer et al., 2021) \nand unobtrusive in comparison to asking individuals to \nanswer a set of predefined questions in a form due to the \ndata’s permanent state of flow  and researchers’ interest in \ninvestigating each phenomenon with the maximum possible \ndegree of realism (Chang et al., 2014). In addition, data \nabundance and complexity make it less practical or desirable \nto organize information in a conventional quantitative \nmanner, with variables in columns and observations in rows \n(Lazer et al., 2020). In sum, the increasing intricacy of social \nphenomena and the abundance of “unfamiliar variables and \ndata formats” (Brandt & Timmermans, 2021, p. 191) may \nmake it less practical the utilization of hypotheses-testing \napproaches.\nThat being the case, machine learning algorithms \n(Borch, 2021) may be needed to identify hidden concepts in \nphenomena-related massive heterogeneous datasets (Lazer \net al., 2021). As a result, it seems plausible to conjecture \nthat a portion of the rigor of future social science research \nmay derive from the appropriate selection and usage of AI-\nrelated computational artifacts to scaffold both quantitative \nand qualitative work.\nWhat matters most for the argument we aim to \nadvance is that the transformations listed above may \nrepresent an opportunity for interpretive researchers, \nindividuals commonly associated with the term fuzzy, as \nHartley (2017) proposed. Similar to what happened with the \ndesigners of self-driving vehicles that had to ask for the help \nof anthropologists to “cope with the social and contextual \ncomplexity of mixed-traffic interaction” (Rothmüller et al., \n2018, p. 482), the use of new algorithms in scholarship \nresearch on social sciences may create a larger space for \nqualitative reasoning. Indeed, when computational methods \nthat can “provide much better predictive performance” than \nstatistical inference methods (Grimmer et al., 2021, p. 398) \nare used to analyze large heterogeneous datasets, social \nscience scholars face a dilemma. The mapping from data to \nthe predictions made by such algorithms is not directly given \nas in a regression, where the estimated coefficients indicate \nthe effects caused by the independent variables (Gentzkow \net al., 2019). Thus, researchers’ ability to explain social \nphenomena by leveraging deep learning models, for example, \nmay strongly depend on a theory-based interpretation of \nresults produced by brute-force computation (Grimmer et \nal., 2022). \nThese transformations seem to be aligned with \nCampagnolo’s (2021) vision of participative epistemology \n(Heron & Reason, 1997) as “an empiricist notion of \nknowledge production whereby all those involved in the \nresearch endeavor (i.e., theories, methods, epistemic objects, \nand subjects) are seen as both co-researchers, whose agency \ncontributes to generating ideas, designing and managing \nthe project, and drawing conclusions; and co-subjects, \nparticipating in the activity that is being researched” \n(Campagnolo, 2021, p. 4). We claim that the increasing \namount and complexity of data used in social sciences \nand the power of machine learning algorithms to uncover \nhidden relationships may end up generating a new way \nof producing knowledge in social sciences. In this sense, \nwe follow Campagnolo’s call for transcending the current \ndivision between paradigms and research approaches \n(Campagnolo, 2021). \nSubstantive research increasingly benefits from an \nepistemology in which the engagement of researchers before \nA.

(2021), the “current abundance \nof data allows us to break free from the deductive mindset \nthat was previously necessitated by data scarcity” (p. 396). \nAs a result, it seems likely that scholars and institutions \ninevitably treat the quantitative-qualitative debate as an \n“internal and obsolete distinction” (Campagnolo, 2021). \nTable 1 shows the differences between the four \napproaches discussed here: qualitative, quantitative, mixed, \nand participative.\nTable 1.

Source: Elaborated by the authors based on Creswell (2013), Van de Ven (2007), Deleuze and Guattari (1980), and Campagnolo (2021). \nThe table summarizes some elements that we develop \nthroughout this article. The first is that the proposed data \nanalysis is neither sequential nor concurrent; it is rhizomatic. \nThat is, it is not hierarchical and has no fixed order. Each step \nalong the research path can lead to any other portion of the \nsame course. \nThe second concerns ontology, which is at the same \ntime subjective (reality is constructed), objective (reality is \nwhat the data show), and virtual (reality is what emerges from \nthe execution of algorithms). The idea of virtual comes from \nthe work of Deleuze (1968): ‘the virtual is real’.\nThe third point refers to abductive epistemology. \nAfter analyzing the algorithms, the researcher asks himself: \nWhat could have made these algorithms tell me this? In such \ncases, without algorithms, the researcher would not see what \nthey produce and, therefore, would not make such logical \ninferences.\nIn addition, the approach is participative, meaning \nthat all forms of knowledge construction are involved in \ngenerating conclusions, followed by abductive reflection.\nThus, provided that the widespread presence of \ncomputational elements in society expands the possibilities of \nacademic research and modifies the social processes one wishes \nto study, we follow Marres (2020) in saying that algorithmic \napproaches to research greatly benefit from interpretative \nprocedures and vice versa. All data types, particularly textual \nones, can now be ‘read’ in “its full hermeneutic complexity \nand nuance” (Mohr et al., 2015, p. 3).\nA. L. A. da Fonseca, P. C. P. de S. Chimenti, M. C.

These models can be \nused for a wide range of natural language processing \ntasks, such as language translation, text summarization, \nsentiment analysis, and question answering. These \nmodels are usually trained on large amounts of text data \nand are able to learn to understand and generate human \nlanguage.” \nAnswer given by the chatGPT language model to the \nquestion: What are deep learning text models? (January 17, \n2023)\nComputational methods are ‘observation and reading \ntools’ (Mohr et al., 2020). They may assist scholars in \nperceiving and incorporating into their hermeneutics patterns \nthat are difficult to visualize, such as those connected to the less \naccessible informants in an ethnographic study (Campagnolo, \n2021). For example, algorithms can enhance interpretative \nresearch, analyzing with accuracy large amounts of text data, \nsuch as interviews or social media posts. Algorithms can \nbe helpful during coding processes, identifying patterns or \nthemes in the data. Thus, questioning whether a researcher \nwould profit from learning to use word embedding models \nlike Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and BERT (Devlin \net al., 2019), for example, corresponds to asking how well \nhe wishes to ‘read’ in contrast to others. Although it may \nseem so, there is no exaggeration in the above statement. The \ntruth is that the world’s increasing complexity recommends \nadopting such methods in qualitative research. While the area \nof ethnography, for example, is rich in epistemic diversity \n(Abramson et al., 2018), even an academic who strictly views \nhis work as a “humanist enterprise within the general field of \ncultural production” (Abramson et al., 2018, p. 257) may \nenormously benefit from the new possibilities offered by \nthose algorithms. Indeed, Marcus (1995) warns us that “any \nethnography of a cultural formation in the world system is \nalso an ethnography of the system” (Marcus, 1995, p. 99), \nwhich means that it examines “the circulation of cultural \nmeanings, objects, and identities in diffuse time-space” \n(Marcus, 1995, p. 96). Thus, an ethnographer’s reading and \nobservation abilities must be capable of dealing with the \n‘rhizomatic’ (Deleuze & Guattari, 1980), in the sense of not \nbeing hierarchical, fixed, and stable, conditions inherent in \nmodern social systems. That includes various contexts and \ncircumstances involved so dynamically with each cultural \nsetting that it is sometimes challenging for the researcher to \nobserve and read everything. Why would a scholar attempt \nto deal with such diversity without utilizing those newly \navailable computational tools? What epistemic cost, if any, do \nmany researchers associate with using algorithms?\nIntegrating algorithms in interpretative \nresearch: A framework proposal\nFor decades, the goal of automated textual content \nanalysis has essentially been to read “large textual corpora in \nsuch a way that critical bits of information could be extracted \nand a measure of informational reliability could be calibrated” \n(Mohr et al., 2015). This approach is about extracting only \nthe essential ideas in a text, precisely those with little room for \nargument regarding their existence (Mohr et al., 2015). Such \ncharacteristic means that these methods commonly disregard \nthe “subtleties of expression, the complexities of phrasing and \nthe more nuanced meanings of text corpora” (Mohr et al., \n2015, p. 2). Because of this limitation, it is not surprising that \nresearchers interested in executing a ‘close reading’ (Gavin et \nal., 2019) of the texts involved in each phenomenon have \nnot historically shown much enthusiasm for this way of doing \nsocial science research. \nHowever, access to new forms of data, such as \ntransactional purchase data, records of social media usage, and \ndata from public and private surveillance, has considerably \nincreased the volume and variety of ‘texts’ that need to be \nread to produce insights into social science (Meckin, 2021). \nDue to this, algorithms such as BERT , which makes it feasible \nto apply previously acquired learning to interpret new text \nsentences, can make a massive difference in interpretive \nresearch. These algorithms can execute the coding of \ninterviews, for example, “at a fraction of the effort of human-\nonly coding while improving reliability” (Li et al., 2021, p. 1). \nIndeed, the explosion of data makes it expensive and difficult \nto ‘close read’ the totality of crucial ‘texts’ in each research \nsituation. Luckily, deep learning algorithms may help reduce, \namongst other elements, the number of dimensions in textual \ndata, thus facilitating the interpretative process (Grimmer et \nal., 2021). \nBecause of the possibilities outlined above, we propose \na framework for interpretive research in which algorithms \nand hermeneutic procedures are integrated. By doing this, \nwe generalize the three-stage computational ground theory \nframework proposed by Nelson (2020). According to the \nnotion that we want to advance, computational tools help \nresearchers account for the multifaceted characteristics of \nmodern social science phenomena. Thus, for researchers \nto have a better chance of answering “contemporary data-\nrich questions” (Nelson, 2020, p. 34), their method of \nconducting interpretive social science research should have \nthe characteristics of an assemblage (Deleuze & Guattari, \n1980) capable of producing a significant number of research \npaths using both algorithms and interpretative tasks.

Scholars commonly take \nadvantage of such a broad concept to talk about techno-\nsocial phenomena, such as the alleged influence of some \ncomputational systems on the “structure of public discourse \nor the functioning of state power” (Matzner, 2022, p. 2). \nThis imprecise and abstract notion of an algorithm may lead \ninterpretive scholars to ascribe to its use an epistemological \ncost that is barely grounded in reality.\nIndeed, a scholar may associate using an algorithm \nin qualitative research with surrendering one’s epistemic \nbeliefs to a “backstage device” that is responsible for “the \nconstant optimization of experience” and undertakes forms \nof “infrastructural surveillance” (Cellard, 2022, p. 983). In \nthese terms, it should be no surprise that ethnographers, \nfor example, are often not very enthusiastic about using \nalgorithms, especially those associated with deep learning. \nHow would someone who views the research process as \naiming for an “in-depth description of the phenomenon \nfrom the perspective of the people involved” (Yilmaz, 2013, \np. 312) positively evaluate the use of a tool whose nature \nis currently associated with the construction of a social \nreality that disregards and possibly manipulates human will \n(O’Neil, 2016)?\nThe academic literature’s casual usage of the term \n‘algorithm’ has resulted in a very non-technical understanding, \nmaking it a pejorative “catchy word symbolizing an opacity \nand growing dehumanization” (Cellard, 2022, p. 983). \nIndeed, we posit that the more fundamental definition of \nan algorithm as the sequence of steps required to complete \na task (Christin, 2020) that is not always computational \n(Cellard, 2022) needs to be reinstated. Interpretive scholars \nshould view an algorithm’s execution as an ‘assemblage’ (Siles \net al., 2020) that encompasses the software being run in a \ncomputer (non-human) and a chain of human actors that \nincludes each author of the code and the individuals who \ntake advantage of the outputs, that is, themselves (Christin, \n2020). Such an assemblage does not exist in a social vacuum. \nBecause of that, Amoore (2020) argues that answering the \nethical question of whether algorithms are good or bad \ndepends on how we use their signals. Instead of criticizing \nthe opacity of deep learning algorithms, she advocates for \na larger ‘aperture of observation’ in the decision-making \nprocesses that are supported by such assemblages. Such \na notion means observing how the moments when the \nalgorithm is wrong “give accounts of algorithmic reason” \n(Amoore, 2020, p. 167).\nDue to the impossibility of assigning an ethical \nvalue to algorithmic decisions, we follow Matzner (2022)in \nsuggesting that researchers commonly embrace a relational \naccount of algorithms to consider each of them “an abstraction \nthat is inherently related to a necessary complement of that \nabstraction in something concrete and particular” (Matzner, \n2022, p. 2). In other words, “algorithms need to be seen as \nbecoming what they ‘are’ only in relations” (Matzner, 2022, \np. 3). The data that an interpretive scholar decides to feed \nthe algorithm is one of these complementary relations. The \nsecond is the ‘aperture of observation’ through which the \nalgorithm’s output influences the scholar’s interpretation. \nThus, it is necessary to dispel the notion that deep learning \nalgorithms possess an agency that would compete with the \nresearcher’s agency. As we have said in this article, societal \nchanges have pushed the amount of data available beyond \nthe threshold that can be treated with the naked eye. While \nit is true that the employment of algorithms generates new \nethical, ontological, and epistemological concerns (Christin, \n2020), it is also true that they confer new capabilities on \ninterpretive scholars. We believe developing a participative \nmindset is the key to taking advantage of these opportunities. \nKeeping an open and dogma-free mind, a crucial aspect of \nexploratory and inductive research, becomes increasingly \nimportant for developing substantive social science research \nthat makes a difference.\nStudying technology adoption with the \nhelp of a deep learning language model\nIn the following lines, we shall illustrate what it means \nto use machine learning in interpretive research by describing \none of our most recent research projects. In work still in \nprogress, we broaden the understanding of the continuous \ncycles of consumers’ enchantment and disenchantment in \ntechnology adoption (Belk et al., 2021). The first author’s \nresearch seeks to answer the following question: What \nproduces, from a cultural point of view, the perpetuity of \nthe desire to acquire each new version of a product whose \ncurrent model may already meet consumer needs?\nThe project examines how current iPhone users express \ntheir feelings about new models on social media. Its goal is to \ncompare the semantic distances between what they say and \nhow Steve Jobs, the original product’s market introducer, \ndescribed the first version. The differences in these distances \nare then interpreted using cultural theories on consumer \ndesire. Indeed, it would be challenging to comprehend the \nphenomenon in all of its nuances without the possibility \nprovided by computation. The semantic proximity of the \ntwo types of discourses provides strong empirical evidence \nthat supports and expands on the interpretation produced \nby articulating the chosen theoretical lens. In addition, \nthe first author’s understanding of the entrepreneurship \nphenomenon based on his experience and a dense reading \nof the same corpus, which the algorithm can scan to identify \nA. L.

Its path corresponds to one of the infinite possible \nactualizations inherent in the assemblage of interpretive \nresearch that employs deep learning language models. The \norder of activation of each hermeneutic and computational \npossibility is determined by the researcher’s desire and the \nproject’s circumstances. The interaction between these two \nspaces of possibilities can be described as a dialog with the \nfollowing format: ‘What I think -> What the algorithm says \n-> What I think -> What the algorithm says’, and so on. The \nepistemic process is participative in that it directly depends \non all the elements being able to participate.\nThe dialogue concludes when the element who \nthinks last says enough for abductive reasoning to take \nplace to produce a statement of the form: “Based on what \nwe learned… it must be that…” In short, there are no set \nbeginning or endpoints. The study concludes when the \nmultiple interactions between the participating elements \nyield a sufficiently good explanation according to the criteria \nestablished inside the assemblage.\nFigure 2. An interpretive study’s research path using a deep learning language model as a scaffolding tool.\nThe research path goes from left to right to represent ‘the passage of time’. While there is just one instance of every activity described here, our framework has absolutely no \nimpediment (see Figure 1) for the repetition of algorithmic and interpretation tasks. In the general case, any activity can occur an arbitrary number of times at any point.\nCONCLUSIONSCONCLUSIONS\nThe proposed debate would be meaningless if not \ncoherently aligned with relevant contemporary themes \n(Bispo, 2022). We believe that using advanced present-\nday computational tools in qualitative research represents \nan opportunity for social science scholars from developing \ncountries. Aside from allowing researchers to understand and \nexplain phenomena in a way that sometimes is impossible \notherwise, algorithmic methods contribute positively to \nvarious operational aspects of theory-generating research \n(Nelson, 2020). They can, for example, help reduce the costs \nassociated with coding textual content (Rodriguez & Storer, \n2020). They also make it more practical and scalable to handle \nvast amounts of heterogeneous data obtained from various \nsources (Evans, 2014). In addition, computational methods \ncan allow qualitative research in the Global South (Dados \n& Connell, 2012) to benefit from datasets originating in \ndeveloped areas more effectively and accomplish the breadth \nof analysis that was previously only achievable in contexts or \ncircumstances with higher budgetary abundance. This last \naspect means that incorporating computational tools can \nhelp lessen firepower inequality in the global landscape of \nqualitative social science research.\nUsing computational methods in qualitative research \nmay increase overall productivity (Nelson et al., 2018). This \nbenefit should suffice in justifying their adoption, given \nthe difficulty of undertaking substantive social research in \ncountries like Brazil. However, we posit that such an element \nis not the primary reason why an interpretivist, for example, \nneeds to consider employing algorithms in his work. \nIndeed, deep learning algorithms play an ever-increasing \nrole in modern society. T ext models such as chatGPT , which \nwas recently introduced, have the potential to completely \ntransform content-generating professions such as teaching \nand journalism (Haque et al., 2022). Instead of arguing that \nalgorithms such as chatGPT reduce the value of a researcher’s \nthinking to the point that they may pose a risk, this article \nseeks to advance a different type of insight.\nThe chatGPT , derived from the GPT-3 algorithm \ndeveloped by the company Open.ai, can be used by social \nscience researchers as a type of co-author with whom they \ncan converse. This article talks about applying an equally \npowerful algorithm: BERT . It enables the first author to \nidentify semantically similar elements of a 2011 keynote \nspeech in the discourse of present-day consumers. From this \nidentification, he derives his interpretation. Although the \ndialogue with BERT was not conducted in natural language, \nthe outcome was comparable: BERT enabled us to read vast \nA. L.

Marketers, \nfor example, already use conventional data mining tools \nto generate insights. However, the present-day scholarship \nhas not contributed significantly to that. Adopting deep \nlearning language models as components of the research \nprocess corresponds to a window of opportunity that can \nenhance researchers’ capacity to address contemporary \nissues by properly informing business practices. Conversely, \nif traditional epistemological silos are maintained, and \nresearchers decide not to expand their toolboxes, there is a \nrisk that marketing research will not adequately explain the \nworld of contemporary consumers, widening the relevance \ngap (Starkey & Madan, 2001).\nThe importance of a researcher’s ability to interpret \nis multiplied many times by algorithms such as chatGPT , \nBERT , and others. In other words, we argue that these \nmodels help capture the more general and quantifiable \nrelationships. What remains to be done is primarily \ncontextual and incommensurable — for instance, that which \ndepends on local cultural elements. If the researcher adopts \na participatory epistemological stance incorporating what \nthe algorithm has learned as his or her learning, the dialogue \nwith such computational artifacts shortens the distance \nseparating the research and what is more substantive while \nassuring a high level of accuracy in the predictions made. In \nsum, deep learning language models are not only fuzzies’ best \nfriends but may also increase the ability of social scientists as \na whole to conduct research that can benefit society.\nREFERENCES\nAbramson, C.
