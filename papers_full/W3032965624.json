  "abstract": "Retrieving of information from the huge set of data flowing due to the day to day development in the technologies has become more popular as it assists in searching for the valuable information in a structured, unstructured or a semi structured data set like text, database, multimedia, documents, and internet etc. The retrieval of information is performed employing any one of the models starting from the simple Boolean model for retrieving information, or using other frame works such as probabilistic, vector space and the natural language modelling. The paper is emphasis on using a natural language model based information retrieval to recover the meaning insights from the enormous amount of data. The method proposed in the paper uses the latent semantic analysis to retrieve significant information’s from the question raised by the user or the bulk documents. The carried out method utilizes the fundamentals of semantic factor occurring in the data set to identify the useful insights. The experiment analysis of the proposed method is carried out with few state of art dataset such as TIME, LISA, CACM and the NPL etc. and the results obtained demonstrate the superiority of the method proposed in terms of precision, recall and F-score.",
