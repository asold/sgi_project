We demonstrate how this approach \nnot only streamlines decision -making but also fosters \na symbiotic relationship between humans and \nmachines in healthcare. \n \nRELATED WORK  \nThe field of cli nical decision support has evolved \nsignificantly over the past two decades. Early systems \nwere expert -rule based, drawing on manually \nencoded knowledge bases to recommend actions. IBM \nWatson Health attempted to revolutionize this space \nby incorporating NLP  and statistical reasoning, but \nfaced integration challenges and interpretability \nconcerns. More recent systems focus on integrating \nmachine learning with EHR data, such as Epic's CDS \nhooks and Cerner’s Health Intent platform. \nHowever, these systems often struggle with \ngeneralization, dynamic context switching, and inter -\nsystem communication. Agent -based modeling has \nseen growing interest in areas such as epidemiological \nsimulation and hospital workflow automation, but its \napplication in real-time patient care has been limited. \nOur work bridges this gap by combining the \nrobustness of multi -agent coordination with the \nprecision of AI-driven clinical reasoning. \nRecent work by Chen et al. (2025) demonstrates the \nethical and technical foundations for modular, agentic \nsystems in healthcare, reinforcing the need for \ntransparent reasoning and context -sharing \nmechanisms. Ferber et al. (2024) explore the \nintegration of autonomous AI agents for complex \ndomains like oncology, showcasing practical \ncoordination across age nts with shared memory. \nGolden et al. (2023) provide insights from \nimplementing AI in mental health decision support, a \ndomain where contextual nuances are critical. These \nstudies collectively support the growing consensus \nthat agentic paradigms offer a vi able, scalable \napproach to augment human clinicians. \n \nSYSTEM ARCHITECTURE  \nOur system is designed around modular, cooperative \nagents, each assigned to a specific task within the \nclinical workflow. The architecture is flexible and \nscalable, enabling seaml ess integration with existing \nhospital information systems. \nAgent Types: \nIntake Agent:  Captures symptoms via structured \nforms and natural language inputs. Uses NLP to \nextract structured data from physician or nurse notes. \nDiagnosis Agent:  Employs decision trees, Bayesian \nnetworks, and transformer -based models to infer \npotential diagnoses. Uses differential diagnosis \nreasoning to prioritize likelihood. \nTriage Agent: Calculates urgency based on vital signs, \nlab results, and established scoring systems like ES I \n(Emergency Severity Index) and NEWS2 (National \nEarly Warning Score). \nInternational Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 12 | Issue 3 \nSankara Reddy Thamma Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, May-June-2025, 12 (3) : 428-433 \n \n \n \n \n 430 \nTreatment Agent: Accesses drug interaction databases, \ntreatment guidelines (e.g., NIH, WHO), and \nformulates personalized plans while accounting for \nallergies, contraindications, and comorbidities. \nCoordinator Agent:  Orchestrates workflow, memory \nsynchronization, agent role hand -offs, and audit \nlogging. \nTable 1.

Long -term memory (via \nNeo4j) stores structured case histories and decision \nlogs, enabling retrospective analysis and patient \nfollow-up. Ferber et al. (2024) highlight this need for \ncross-agent memory coherence, especially in domains \nwith longitudinal patient data. \nInter-Agent Communication: \nAgents communicate via the Model Context Protocol \n(MCP) from the OpenAI Agentic SDK. Messages are \nenriched with role -based metadata and patient \ncontext, ensuring seamless transitions between agents. \n \n \nTool Integration: \nThe system interfaces with a suite of standardized \nAPIs and external medical services to enhance its \ndiagnostic, triage, and treatment capabilities. It \nutilizes FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability \nResources) for seamless EHR interoperability, \nallowing agents to retrieve and update patient data in \nreal time . For evidence -based reasoning, the system \nemploys retrieval -augmented generation (RAG) \ntechniques that query medical literature databases \nlike PubMed. In addition, it integrates third -party \nclinical tools such as Infermedica, which assist in \nsymptom check ing and early -stage differential \ndiagnosis. \nZakka et al. (2023) demonstrated that retrieval -\naugmented systems significantly enhance the \nfactuality and completeness of clinical responses, \nsupporting the relevance of such tools in complex, \ndynamic medical settings. \nIllustrative Diagrams \nFigure 1: System Architecture Diagram \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nInternational Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 12 | Issue 3 \nSankara Reddy Thamma Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, May-June-2025, 12 (3) : 428-433 \n \n \n \n \n 431 \nFigure 2: Data Integration Workflow \n \n \nFigure 3: Agent Decision Pathway \n \nMETHODOLOGY  \n4.1 Synthetic Dataset Design \nTo rigorously evaluate the agentic AI framework in a \nclinically realistic but controllable setting, we \nconstructed a comprehensive synthetic dataset using \nhealthcare simulation tools, inspired by public \nresources like MIMIC-III and Synthea. Each synthetic \npatient profile was built to represent a holistic clinical \npicture, including: \n Demographics: age, gender, ethnicity \n Presenting complaints and structured symptom \ndescriptions \n Vital signs: temperature, blood pressure, heart \nrate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation \n Lab values, imaging summaries, and EHR -like \nphysician notes \n Comorbidities, medication allergies, and current \nmedication regimens \nThe dataset spans five major diagnostic categories: \n Respiratory distress \n Abdominal pain \n Chest pain \n Neurological deficits \n Geriatric polypharmacy cases \nTo challenge system adaptabilit y, edge cases were \nintroduced with overlapping or ambiguous symptoms \n(e.g., chest pain with gastrointestinal mimicry) and \natypical presentations in elderly patients. Clinical \nplausibility was reviewed by practicing physicians to \nensure realism and diversity across cases. \n4.2 Evaluation Process \nThe agentic AI system was evaluated through a \nstructured, multi-phase benchmarking process: \n1. Case Simulation : Each synthetic profile was \nprocessed through the full agentic pipeline —\nintake, diagnosis, triage, and treatment planning. \nOutputs were logged for physician review. \n2. Expert Review Panel : A panel of three board -\ncertified clinicians independently scored the \nrecommendations for accuracy, safety, and \nclarity. Reviewers were blinded to whether the \noutput came fro m the agentic AI or a traditional \nsystem. \n3. Baseline Comparison : Each case was also run \nthrough a rules -based CDSS. Metrics were \ncompared side-by-side to evaluate improvement. \n4. Stress Testing : Edge cases —such as conflicting \nsymptoms or contraindicated medicat ions—were \nused to evaluate robustness. \n\nInternational Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 12 | Issue 3 \nSankara Reddy Thamma Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, May-June-2025, 12 (3) : 428-433 \n \n \n \n \n 432 \nThis hybrid evaluation approach ensured a fair, \nclinical-quality comparison while revealing system \nbehavior in nuanced and high-risk scenarios. \n4.3 Metrics Definition \nWe defined five core metrics to evaluate system \nperformance: \n Diagnostic Accuracy : Proportion of cases where \nthe top-ranked diagnosis matched the physician -\nvalidated gold standard. \n Triage Precision : Agreement between agent \ntriage output and standardized scoring systems \nsuch as ESI and NEWS2. \n Treatment Vali dity: Extent to which \nrecommended treatments followed institutional \nand global medical guidelines (e.g., NIH, WHO). \n Latency: Average end-to-end response time from \ninput ingestion to treatment recommendation. \n Physician Satisfaction : Mean Likert -scale score \n(1–5) measuring trust, usability, and perceived \nhelpfulness of the system. \nEach metric was calculated over 150 unique cases. For \nquantitative rigor, we computed means, standard \ndeviations, and confidence intervals. Statistical \nsignificance of system differ ences was tested using a \ntwo-tailed t-test at α = 0.05. \nGolden et al. (2023) emphasized the importance of \nstakeholder trust in AI -based CDS, guiding our \nevaluation framework to include both technical \nperformance and physician feedback. \n \n \n \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \nThe agentic AI system outperformed traditional CDSS \nacross all metrics. Notably, it demonstrated improved \nadaptability in ambiguous cases and handled \ncomorbidity scenarios with greater nuance. \nMetric Agentic AI \nSystem \nTraditional \nCDSS \nDiagnostic \nAccuracy \n0.924 0.841 \nTriage Precision 0.952 0.876 \nTreatment \nValidity \n0.905 0.833 \nLatency (avg, \nseconds) \n3.7 6.2 \nPhysician \nSatisfaction \n4.6/5 3.8/5 \n \nCase Study:  \nOne illustrative case involved a 56 -year-old male \npresenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. \nThe Intake Agent flagged risk factors like smoking \nand obesity. The Diagnosis Agent returned a \ndifferential including unstable angina, pulmonary \nembolism, and GERD. The Triage Agent assigned a \nLevel 2 ESI score. The Treatment Agent pro posed an \nECG, troponin test, and aspirin initiation —later \nconfirmed appropriate by an MD. The system \ncompleted this cycle in under 4 seconds. \n \nETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  \nAI systems in healthcare must be transparent, \nexplainable, and privacy -compliant. Our system \nadheres to HIPAA and supports audit trails for every \ndecision made. Each agent logs its decision tree, \nretrieved documents, and confidence levels. In \nambiguous or low -confidence situations, the \nCoordinator Agent flags the case for human review. \nThe importance of auditability and human oversight \nhas been echoed in recent work by Chen et al. (2025), \nwho advocate for ethical agent governance models \naligned with real-world accountability standards. This \n\nInternational Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology | www.ijsrset.com | Vol 12 | Issue 3 \nSankara Reddy Thamma Int J Sci Res Sci Eng Technol, May-June-2025, 12 (3) : 428-433 \n \n \n \n \n 433 \nis particularly critical in patient -facing AI, where \nautomation bias must be mitigated through interface \ntransparency and decision traceability. \n \nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK  \nWhile promising, our system currently assumes high -\nquality input data, which may not always be available. \nReal-world deployment will require robust error \nhandling and adaptive learning mechanisms. \n EHR integration varies across institutions and \nmay affect interoperability. \n Expansion to specialties like oncology or \npsychiatry will require new agent skills and \ndomain-specific knowledge bases. \n Future enhancements include: \no Multimodal reasoning from radiology images \nand genomics \no Federated learning for privacy -preserving \nmodel updates \no Patient-facing conversational agents for \nshared decision-making \nAs Lidströmer and Eldar (2022) highlight in their \nanalysis of AI responses to COVID -19, future systems \nmust also be resilient to emergency settings and \ncapable of functioning under limited or rapidly \nevolving data conditions. \n \nCONCLUSION  \nAgentic AI offers a compelling ev olution of clinical \ndecision support, combining the precision of AI with \nthe flexibility of agentic systems. By orchestrating \ncollaborative agents around clinical tasks, our \nframework delivers more accurate, efficient, and \ncontext-aware recommendations. Th is approach not \nonly enhances physician workflows but also sets the \nfoundation for future intelligent, transparent, and \nethically aligned healthcare systems. \n \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1].
