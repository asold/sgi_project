This has\nimportant evolutionary implications, especially following the recent discovery of the earliest\nstone tools (Lomekwian) at Lomekwi 3 (West Turkana, Kenya), which has pushed back the\ndawn of stone flaking to 3.3 Mya [3]. The Lomekwi assemblage shows that hominins were\nintentionally flaking stone tools, and suggests the emergence of stone tool knapping during a\nperiod close to the divergence of panin and hominin lineages. Therefore, stone flaking might\nnot be associated exclusively with the genus Homo, but may have occurred in other taxa. At 3.3\nMya, the only hominins known (and therefore the likely makers of the Lomekwian tools) had\nbrains no bigger than living African apes. Thus, comparison of hominin and chimpanzee\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0166 788 November 21, 2016 1 / 25\na11111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Arroyo A, Hirata S, Matsuzaw a T, de la\nTorre I (2016) Nut Cracking Tools Used by Captive\nChimpanz ees (Pan troglod ytes) and Their\nCompariso n with Early Stone Age Percussive\nArtefacts from Olduvai Gorge.

The use of pounding\ntools is a common behaviour recognized in both living non-human primates and the archaeo-\nlogical record. Pounding activities could have played an important role in hominin behaviour\nand probably contributed to the emergence of stone tool knapping [11–13]; the latter is a\nmajor research topic in the archaeology of human evolution and the subject of much debate.\nResearch in recent decades has focused on the use of chimpanzees as a reference to model\nhominin behaviour and the emergence of stone knapping. However, the models generated\nhave limitations, as they directly compare flaked archaeological tools with pounding tools used\nin chimpanzee nut cracking activities. As the archaeological record also contains pounding\ntools that can be compared with battered artefacts produced by modern primates, it is possible\nto develop cross-disciplinary comparative frameworks.\nThis study provided a unique opportunity to develop a comparative approach, as it com-\nbined primatological behavioural observations and analysis of stone tools used by captive\nchimpanzees. We collected raw materials at Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania) and conducted a series\nof experiments with captive chimpanzees at the Kumamoto Sanctuary (Japan). We used\ntechno-typological descriptions and low magnification microscopic and use-wear spatial dis-\ntribution analyses of captive chimpanzee experimental artefacts (see below). The results can be\ndirectly compared with findings from other studies on modern humans [14] and wild chim-\npanzees [15], and contribute to the creation of a larger dataset with which to better understand\nthe role of percussive activities in human evolution.\nBackground\nLong-term primatological field observations have enabled the study of nut cracking in wild\nchimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), an activity that infant individuals (of about 3.5 years old) begin\nto learn by observing their mothers and other members of the community in a process that\nMatsuzawa et al. named ‘education by master-apprenticeship’ [16–19].\nField observations of wild chimpanzees reveal sex differences in nut cracking performance\n[20, 21], variation between neighbouring groups [22], and shed light on stone tool transport\n[23, 24] and raw material selection [25]. Studies have also revealed that West African chimpan-\nzees use a range of tools to process nuts, including clubs, mobile anvils and hammers, fixed\nanvils available in the landscape (roots), and branches [26–28]. As such, pounding activities\nare part of a much wider tool-using repertoire defined as complex cultural behaviour [29].\nIn addition, some captive chimpanzees research projects have studied the motion and\nkinetics involved in nut cracking activities [30, 31], and those aspects that reflect chimpanzee\ncognitive capabilities (e.g. object manipulation, transmission of tool use, and colour recogni-\ntion) [32, 33]. Others studies have focused on behavioural patterns and the process of learning\nto crack nuts using a hammer and anvil [34–37].\nWynn and McGrew ([4], page 384) stated that ‘the most direct way to compare Oldowan\nand chimpanzee technology is to compare the tools themselves’, and argued that there are sim-\nilarities in hominin and chimpanzee tool use. Mercader and colleagues [7] claimed similarities\nbetween the by-products found at the Panda 100 chimpanzee nut cracking site and Oldowan\nflakes. Recently, research has focused on reconstruction of the chaîne opératoire of nut crack-\ning [24] and the application of 3D and geographic information system (GIS) techniques in the\nanalysis of chimpanzee stone tools [15]; the latter techniques provide quantitative data of use-\nTools Used by Captive Chimpanze es and Their Comparison with Percussive Artefa cts from Olduvai Gorge\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0166 788 November 21, 2016 2 / 25\nKAKENHI grant numbers 2400000 1 and\n16H06283).\nCompeting Interests : The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nwear marks and descriptions that can be compared with archaeological pounding tools. Other\nresearch approaches have explored differences between the skills and mechanics used in nut\ncracking and stone tool knapping to assess the origins of flaking technologies [38, 39].\nHowever, some comparisons of chimpanzee and archaeological assemblages are limited\n[40], as they compare intentionally knapped cores and flakes with pounding tools that have\naccidentally fractured. Such studies rarely have considered raw material differences between\nassemblages and their potential effect on the type and distribution of use-wear traces and\ndevelopment of fractures. It is more useful to compare chimpanzee stone tools with archaeo-\nlogical tools of the same raw material that have a similar function.\nPounding tools have been found in a number of Early Stone Age (ESA) archaeological sites\n[3, 41–43]. Identification of archaeological pounding tools relies on recognition of conspicu-\nous marks, such as large battered areas, impacts, or specific fracture types [13, 43–46]. In places\nsuch as Olduvai Gorge, percussive processes were of greater importance than stone knapping\nin some assemblages, as indicated by the presence of a range of artefacts such as anvils, ham-\nmerstones, spheroids and subspheroids with battering marks and fractures linked to their use\nas percussive tools [13]. However, identifying the type of activity for which these objects were\nused is more problematic. At present, Gesher Benot Ya’aqov (Israel) is the only ESA site where\nit has been possible to link pounding tools to nut cracking, as the excellent preservation of the\nsite has allowed identification of different nut species associated with pitted stones [47–49].\nAlthough microscopic analysis has been widely used on flaked tools (following Semenov’s\n[50] work) and on grinding stones [51–55], it has rarely been applied to ESA stone tools [56–\n60]. To gain a better understanding of the role of percussive activities in human evolution, we\nhave developed a systematic experimental approach. This approach uses a variety of analytical\ntechniques, such as spatial distribution analysis and micro-wear studies [14, 61], and was used\nto analyse the pounding tools in this study.\nMaterials and Methods\nExperimental settings\nOur experimental research took place at the Kumamoto Sanctuary Wildlife Research Center\nbetween July 26\nth\n2013 and October 17\nth\n2014 (Fig 1 and S1 Video). The individuals appearing\non the videos and figures in this manuscript have given written informed consent (as outlined\nin PLOS consent form) to be shown. All experiments were conducted following protocols and\nethical guidelines approved by the Animal Experimentation Committee of the Wildlife\nResearch Center (Kyoto University). Four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were selected based\non their age and their previous experience with stone tool use: Tsubaki (female, 18 years;\nGAIN [Great Ape Information Network] #0551), Natsuki (female, 8 years; GAIN #0677),\nMizuki (female, 16 years; GAIN #0559), and Kohtaroh (male, 21 years; GAIN #0500). Tsubaki,\nNatsuki, and Mizuki acquired the skill of using stone tools to crack nuts through social obser-\nvation of conspecifics who had already mastered the technique, a process that has been\ndescribed elsewhere [36, 37]. Once learnt, nut cracking became a regular activity among the\nchimpanzees, who were provided with nuts and could use stones available in their enclosure to\ncrack them. Subsequently, these chimpanzees were included in other studies investigating the\ncognition underlying nut cracking behaviour [31, 62]. During the two weekly sessions, the\nthree females (who had 5–10 years’ experience of the procedure) processed a total of 10–50\nnuts.\nThe male chimpanzee Kohtaroh acquired the skill through active training by a human care-\ntaker that began in November 2011. First, the caretaker trained the chimpanzee to use a stone\ntool by moulding: the caretaker gave the chimpanzee a hammerstone to grasp and then held\nTools Used by Captive Chimpanze es and Their Comparison with Percussive Artefa cts from Olduvai Gorge\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0166 788 November 21, 2016 3 / 25\nFig 1.

This type of training was provided about 10 times (i.e. 10 nuts cracked)\nin each session, two to five times per month, after which human intervention was gradually\nreduced until Kohtaroh could complete the entire process by himself. After a total of 32 train-\ning sessions over 19 months, Kohtaroh first accomplished the entire process alone in May\n2013. The behaviour was encouraged through practiced one to three times per month until the\npresent experiment began in July 2014.\nTherefore, Mizuki, Tsubaki and Natsuki had some dexterity in nut cracking prior to the\npresent study, and Kohtaroh had the least skill. However, Mizuki had trouble manipulating\nthe tools during the experiments, owing to the tabular morphology of the hammer (and the\nway she held it and performed the striking movement). This made it difficult for her to suc-\ncessfully crack the nuts, so she was replaced with Natsuki. Natsuki and Tsubaki also had trou-\nbles handling the lava hammerstones due to their size.\nThe chimpanzees’ target was to strike a nut to access the kernel. As seen on the S1 Video,\nboth hands are used for this activity but the hands do not make contact: one hand is used to\nhold the hammer and crack the nut while the other is used to place the nut on the anvil. The\nfemales always used their right hand when using the stone hammer, whereas the male always\nused his left. Hand preference emerged spontaneously, as occurs with wild chimpanzees.\nThe chimpanzee living areas were large and sufficiently complex to allow the animals to\nrest, exercise, and socialize with other members of the group [63]. They had three main meals\nper day of fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts and leaves, supplemented with occasional enrich-\nment programmes. Water was available throughout the day. The chimpanzees voluntarily par-\nticipated in this study and were never deprived of food or water.\nNut cracking experiments took place in an enclosed indoor cage during feeding time. All\nsessions were recorded using three digital cameras (two located inside, and one outside the\nenclosure). The instructor placed the anvil on a terracotta slab to stabilize it and avoid damage\nproduced by contact with the floor. A nut and hammerstone were placed close to the chimpan-\nzee, whose task was to pick up the nut, place it on the anvil, and crack it with the hammerstone.\nOccasionally, the instructor helped the chimpanzees, especially when the nut rolled off the\nanvil surface, by repositioning the nut on the anvil. Experiments with Kohtaroh differed\nslightly, as the experiments were conducted through a mesh barrier for security reasons (S1\nVideo). In these sessions, the instructor placed the nut on the anvil and assisted Kohtaroh dur-\ning the activity. The fact that Kohtaroh performed the experiments through a mesh barrier did\nnot seem to be a constraint. Kohtaroh’s efficiency actually improved throughout the experi-\nmental sessions as he gradually required less strikes to open a nut and was able to crack nuts\nvia correct axial movements without hitting the anvil.\nTo keep trials consistent, a maximum of 200 nuts was processed with each anvil and ham-\nmerstone. However, as shown in Table 1, it was not possible to complete sessions for one set of\nquartzite tools and two sets of lava tools due to handling problems (as described above).\nMaterials\nWe used macadamia nuts (Macadamia integrifolia) because the chimpanzees were familiar\nwith them, and had processed them previously [36]. A macadamia nut has a diameter of\napproximately 23–25 mm, although it can reach 28 mm depending on the variety [64], and\nrequires a compressive force of 2 kN to fracture [38]. Although we attempted during the exper-\niments to introduce oil palm nuts (Elaeis guineensis), a species commonly consumed by Afri-\ncan wild chimpanzees [24, 65–67], the subjects rejected them because of neophobia [68]. As\nmacadamia nuts have a similar hardness to African nut species (Elaeis guineensis and Coula\nTools Used by Captive Chimpanze es and Their Comparison with Percussive Artefa cts from Olduvai Gorge\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0166 788 November 21, 2016 5 / 25\nedulis), they are appropriate to model use-wear formation processes in the absence of African\nnuts.\nQuartzite blocks (n = 8) and lava cobbles (n = 4) were used (see dimensions in Table 2) as\nhammers and anvils. Quartzite was collected from Naibor Soit (Olduvai Gorge), the primary\nsource of quartzite used at Olduvai Gorge during the Pleistocene [69]. The lavas (basalt and\ntrachyte) were mainly fine- and medium-grained cobbles collected from the river bed at Oldu-\nvai. All blanks were scrutinized before the experiments to document any pre-existing marks or\nfractures to avoid misidentification with use-wear marks, and were classified for use as active\nor passive elements (following Chavaillon’s terminology [70]).\nThis study followed protocols used by de la Torre et al. [14], and included a techno-typolog-\nical description of pounding pieces as well as positives detached during their use. Low magnifi-\ncation use-wear analysis (<100×) was conducted using a Leica S8APO microscope with a\nmagnification range of 1×–8×, equipped with a 10× lens, a 3.1-megapixel digital camera EC3,\nand fibre optic illumination. Spatial distribution analysis using GIS techniques was conducted.\nAfter the experiments, every rock sample was examined and the presence of residues and pre-\nliminary wear traces was recorded. The pieces were then rinsed with water and cleaned in an\nultrasonic bath in neutral soap for 15–20 min to remove all residues, prior to detailed micro-\nand macroscopic analysis.\nTable 1.

Only in two instances (tool O35, used by Tsubaki) was the hammerstone\naccidentally turned over, but the use was negligible. In the case of O11 (used by Kohtaroh),\nthe hammerstone plane was switched during the very first sessions at the beginning of the\nexperiments, as Kohtaroh was having difficulties manipulating it. It was at this early stage of\nthe experimental sessions that fragments were detached from the hammer.\nAll quartzite and lava samples showed little change to their original tabular and cobble mor-\nphology. Pieces O48 and O11 lost greater mass than other pieces (4.6 g and 45.6 g respectively),\nalthough their maximum dimensions remained the same. Objects O15 and O48 did not\ndevelop any fractures and the small amount of mass loss (Table 2) was related to the large\ncrushed areas identified on their surfaces. Macroscopic traces on all quartzite samples were\nconsistent, bearing small battered areas and impact points; only two pieces (O35 and O11)\nshowed negatives caused by the detachment of percussive positives. Only two of the lava pieces\nshowed superficial modification of their surfaces, represented by isolated impact points. The\nalmost total absence of wear traces for lava hammers and anvils was related to their low degree\nof use (as shown in Table 1, it was not possible to complete the experiments with those tools,\nwhich were used to crack only 13 nuts in total).\nTwo pounding tools (O35 and O11, both used as active elements) developed fractures,\nalthough only fragments from O11 were recovered (n = 39) (Fig 2). Most positives were small\nfragments <15 mm long (Group 5; n = 35 [89.74%], see measurements in Table 3), one\n(2.56%) was an angular chunk (Group 4), and three (7.69%) showed characteristics typical of\nregular knapping flakes (Group 2.3); that is, possessing a butt, impact point, and bulb of per-\ncussion. Two fragments conjoined in a dorsal-ventral refit. The absence of battering traces on\nplatforms indicates that these percussive positives were detached with a direct impact caused\nby contact between the active and the passive element.\nMost percussive by-products do not share the same morphological features as knapping\nflakes. A recent analysis of a sample of pounding tools used by wild chimpanzees from Bossou\n(Guinea) [61], identified edges, corners, and irregular fragments with the same morphological\nfeatures as percussive positives recorded at the archaeological chimpanzee site of Noulo (Ivory\nCoast) [8] and, as those identified at Olduvai Gorge, which were originally classified as anvil\nfragments [13]. In all cases, percussive positives were produced mostly when the hammer\ncame into contact with the anvil. Detachment is also greatly conditioned by raw material char-\nacteristics (isotropic rocks fracture more readily than anisotropic ones).\nMicroscopic analysis\nMicroscopic analysis of the pounding pieces revealed common patterns in both quartzite and\nlava objects. Isolated impact points with a circular shape were the main stigmas identified on\nthe working surfaces of quartzite passive elements, as well as crushed areas resulting from a\nseries of superposed impacts fracturing quartzite crystals (Table 4, Fig 3A and 3B). Occasion-\nally, pits caused by micro-fracturing and detachment of small crystal fragments, were associ-\nated with these crushed areas (Fig 3A). Some residues were retained on the surface of areas\nwhere nuts were repeatedly placed. However, no modification of the blank could be identified\nin these areas after cleaning (Fig 3A and 3B).\nThe main percussive traces identified on lava tools (both passive and active elements)\nwere isolated, superficial impact points (Fig 4A), circular in morphology and with a\nTools Used by Captive Chimpanze es and Their Comparison with Percussive Artefa cts from Olduvai Gorge\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0166 788 November 21, 2016 7 / 25\ndiameter <1 mm. The absence of any visible mark on one tool (passive element O125) was\nrelated to a low degree of use. Residues were identified on the working surface of piece O74\n(Fig 4A), enabling us to identify the area where nuts were placed. However, no microscopic\ntraces had developed in this area.\nSimilar results were obtained in the analysis of active elements. All (four quartzite and two\nlavas) showed impacts on their surface, but only the three quartzite hammerstones used in\ncompleted sessions developed large crushed areas (a total of 4.87 cm\n2\nfor tool O11; 1.88 cm\n2\nin\nFig 2.

First, the positive from Group 4 (1), located on the left lateral side of the plane, was detached .\nThis was followed by the two positives from Group 2.3 that conjoined on a dorsal-ve ntral refit located on the proximal plane (2).

Again, quartzite blanks showed a higher incidence of percus-\nsive traces (Fig 5) than lava blanks, as the latter were only used for a short period of time. Two\npieces (O35 and O11) bore chipping marks on their edges associated with crushed areas, in\nwhich crystals appeared micro-fractured with occasional formation of hertzian cones associ-\nated with small detached fragments and the development of small pits.\nSpatial distribution of use-wear\nTen pieces developed clear macroscopic traces suitable for spatial distribution analysis follow-\ning protocols set out by de la Torre et al. [14] (results shown in S1 Table). From a morphologi-\ncal perspective, damage affected a larger area on passive elements than active elements; the\nlargest areas (>150 cm\n2\n) and perimeters (>50 cm) were on three anvils (O28, O48, and O15).\nThe PA (percentage of tool surface covered by wear marks) and D (density of wear marks)\nindices allow us to quantify modification of the working surfaces.\nTable 3.

A similar\npattern was found for the density of wear traces: active elements showed the highest values\n(mean D = 0.13 cm\n2\n; SD = 0.05 cm\n2\n). Individually, the highest PA values were shown by the\nset of tools O11 and O48 (4.37% and 3.81%, respectively), which was used by Kohtaroh. Pieces\nO15 and O35 (used by Tsubaki) had the highest density of percussive traces (0.12 cm\n2\nand 0.19\ncm\n2\n, respectively), as this set showed the largest number of individual wear traces (S1 Table).\nIn contrast, two lava objects (active element O72 and passive element O74) had the lowest\nPA (<0.5%), but this low degree of modification was related to their low degree of use\n(Table 1). In general, all objects showed a very low D index regardless of their use; all values\nwere always below 0.20% (S1 Table), indicating a low degree of modification on the quartzite\nand lava stones used by the chimpanzees.\nGIS analysis of distance to the anvil edge (DAE) and distance to the anvil centre (DAC)\nindicated that macroscopic wear traces were more frequently located close to the edges on all\nquartzite objects, regardless of their function or intensity of use. In contrast, these traces were\nmore centred on lava tools (mean DAE <1.5 cm for all quartzite except piece O39, and\nbetween 2 and 3 cm for lavas; mean DAC >4 cm on quartzite samples and DAC <3 cm on\nlavas). The distribution of wear traces was more scattered on quartzite (mean elongation = 3.48;\nSD = 2.37) than on lava tools (mean elongation = 1.68; SD = 0.41) (Fig 6 and S1 Table).\nIn addition, analysis of the shape of percussive marks using the mean shape of percussive\nmarks index (S1 Table) showed that, with the exception of one active element (O72) on which\nuse-wear traces had a circular shape (mean shape of percussive marks = 1.04), traces on the\npercussive tools were more irregular in morphology.\nUse-wear formation processes\nWear traces on captive chimpanzee pounding tools may be associated with the contact\nbetween active and passive elements, but it is essential to understand why there is a general\ntendency for marks to be located close to the edge. To determine this, all video tapes were\nclosely reviewed, allowing identification of three different mechanisms involved in the forma-\ntion of use-wear traces (S2 Video).\nThe first mechanism is associated with the compressive force (Fig 7A) applied when an\nindividual hits the nut using an axial movement. In this case, the active element is held perpen-\ndicular to the passive element and there is no contact between both pounding tools. As Oldu-\nvai quartzite and lava tools are hard and resistant raw materials, this compressive force does\nnot produce any modification of the objects, because the force transmitted by the active ele-\nment is absorbed mainly by the nut.\nThe second mechanism also involves an axial motion, and an occasional semi-circular\nmovement. However, in this case the active element is handled at a 45˚ angle to the anvil, so\nthat when hitting the nut, a compressive force is produced and peripheral contact between the\nactive and the passive element occurs (Fig 7B). As a result, battered areas and concentrations\nof impact points appear in off-centre areas of the working surfaces.\nFig 3. Quartzite passive elements.

Consequently, percussive traces described and identi-\nfied during analysis of the experimental sample may be associated exclusively with a stone-\nagainst-stone process.\nDiscussion\nComparison of captive and wild chimpanzee pounding tools. The results of the experi-\nmental programme described here can be compared with data collected from other analyses of\nwild chimpanzees. In this comparison, we focus on pounding tools, but it is worth noting that\none of the main differences in nut cracking between wild chimpanzees and the captive chim-\npanzees in this study is how they execute the activity. In the wild, chimpanzees have to solve\nproblems such as stabilizing the anvil or placing the nut on those areas of the anvil where it\ndoes not roll away. In the present experiment, the human instructor placed the passive element\non a terracotta slab. This was to stabilize it and avoid damage produced by contact with the\nfloor. In addition, when a nut rolled off the anvil, the human instructor assisted in reposition-\ning it, to prevent the captive chimpanzee damaging the tools by hitting them against the floor\nand to guide the chimpanzee toward using the target anvil. In short, human assistance in the\npresent study was aimed at simplifying variables so that we could focus on the effect of the\nimpact on the hammer, anvil stone, and nut, and eliminate the effect of any contact between\nthe anvil and the floor, or between the hammer and objects other than the anvil provided for\nthe test.\nAll quartzite tools (both passive and active elements) used at the Kumamoto Sanctuary\nshowed similar wear patterns, with impacts and small crushed areas located on peripheral\nareas of the active surfaces. Furthermore, there was a tendency for pounding tools used in nut\ncracking activities to have a low percentage of their surface covered by percussive marks (PA\n<5%).\nThere are some differences between the present spatial analysis results and the record of\nstone tools used by wild chimpanzees from Bossou. GIS analysis and 3D modelling of chim-\npanzee pounding tools at Bossou show that percussive marks are concentrated in central areas\ncovering a large portion of the working surfaces, with the presence of off-centre percussive\ntraces [15]. This pattern has been interpreted as indicating use by less skilled juvenile individu-\nals and/or contact between the hammer and anvil [15].\nWe can now refine this hypothesis through analysis of the quartzite assemblage at the\nKumamoto Sanctuary and the video-recordings data. The raw material, motion/kinetics, and\nindividual skill level are the main factors that determine the formation and distribution of\nwear traces on chimpanzee stone tools. Friable and ductile raw materials tend to develop\ndepressions, as observed on African iron oxide (laterite) anvils from Bossou [15] or wooden\nanvils, such as those found across the Tai forest in Ivory Coast [26], resulting in percussive\nmarks that cover larger areas of the working surfaces. These depressions tend to grow in depth\nas anvils continue to be used, enhancing the stability of the nut. However, the compressive\nforce applied when hitting a nut has considerably less effect on more resistant raw materials\nsuch as quartzite or basalt, so that macroscopically distinctive wear traces are produced only\nafter recurrent use.\nKinetics plays an important role in successfully breaking the nutshell [31], and the motion\nand skill of individuals is important in the formation of percussive marks. In these cases, the\nTools Used by Captive Chimpanze es and Their Comparison with Percussive Artefa cts from Olduvai Gorge\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0166 788 November 21, 2016 16 / 25\nway the subject manipulates the hammer and the manner in which the action is completed can\ninfluence the quantity and location of wear traces. This is especially so for tools with regular\nand hard surfaces (i.e. quartzite) on which the absence of depressions or irregularities makes\nplacing the nuts more difficult, with the result that a larger area of the working surface is used.\nThus, at Kumamoto the pounding tools with larger areas of their working surfaces covered\nby percussive marks (PA >3.5%) were those used by the less skilled chimpanzee Kohtaroh,\nalthough the distribution pattern of use-wear does not differ from that of other percussive arte-\nfacts used by other individuals. At Bossou, however, identification of pounding tools used by\njuvenile or less skilled individuals is more difficult, as the same stones are reused by different\nindividuals. Nevertheless, the clear presence of wear traces on peripheral areas and the greater\nnumber of fractures on tools, could be used as a reference point to detect the use of pounding\ntools by less skilled chimpanzees.\nComparison of chimpanzee and modern human experimental pounding tools. The\ndistribution of percussive marks on the Kumamoto captive chimpanzee pounding tools are\nconsistent with patterns recognized by de la Torre et al. [14] in a series of pounding experi-\nments using Olduvai Gorge quartzite rocks for nut cracking, meat tenderizing, plant process-\ning, bipolar knapping (in which a core is placed on an anvil and is struck with a hammerstone)\nand bone breaking. Their nut cracking experiments (processing Coula edulis and Elaeis gui-\nneensis) with modern humans also resulted in the production of off-centre isolated impacts on\nanvils caused by failed strikes.\nOn modern human and some captive chimpanzee nut cracking tools (O28, O50, O15), use-\nwear (PA index) covers less than 1.5% of their working surface (S1 Table, and de la Torre et al.,\nTable 6 [14]), highlighting the low degree of modification caused by pounding tools and illus-\ntrating that force transmitted by the active element is absorbed mainly by the nut. Therefore,\nexperiments undertaken by two different species with clear skill differences–for example, a\nmodern human needed a total of 145 strikes to crack 1 kg of Coula nuts [14] (with an average\nof 2.2 hits per nut), whereas Tsubaki (the captive chimpanzee with the best score), required\n5.24 hits to crack a macadamia nut–, showed that the same activity using the same raw mate-\nrial, produced similar wear trace patterns. These similarities can be explained from a mechani-\ncal perspective, because both humans and chimpanzees performed the activity using axial\ncompressive force to break the nutshell [71].\nIt is also worth noting that wear patterns described on the sets of quartzite pounding tools\nused by captive chimpanzees also show similarities with some anvils used in meat and plant\nprocessing by modern humans [14] (Fig 8). Consequently, experimental quartzite pounding\ntools used by humans and chimpanzees have more similarities than differences, and the use-\nwear pattern on these tools encourages attempts to identify archaeological tools used for nut\ncracking. In addition, experiments with both modern humans [14] and captive chimpanzees\n(this study) indicate that some activities may leave very superficial impact marks, and suggest\nthat many artefacts could have been used without showing apparent traces of modification.\nComparison with the archaeological record. One outcome of this study is the produc-\ntion of a reference collection of quartzite and lava pounding tools that can be compared\ndirectly with the archaeological record from Olduvai Gorge. Mary Leakey identified a large\nnumber of percussive artefacts in the Bed I and II assemblages [41], including anvils thought\nto be tools used in bone-breaking activities. Later analyses of the fossil assemblages showed the\npresence of percussive marks, suggesting that hominins were breaking bones to extract mar-\nrow [72, 73].\nA techno-typological analysis of pounding tools from Olduvai Gorge by Mora and de la\nTorre revealed fractures, impacts, and battered areas visible macroscopically [13]. A recent\nmicroscopic analysis of a selection of pounding tools from Olduvai Gorge, originally classified\nTools Used by Captive Chimpanze es and Their Comparison with Percussive Artefa cts from Olduvai Gorge\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0166 788 November 21, 2016 17 / 25\nTools Used by Captive Chimpanze es and Their Comparison with Percussive Artefa cts from Olduvai Gorge\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0166 788 November 21, 2016 18 / 25\nby Leakey as anvils [74], showed percussive traces (mainly impact points and crushing areas),\nand occasional fractures located on the edges. A very low percentage of the surface (<1%, see\n[74]) of the so-called anvils classified by Leakey were covered by percussive traces, and had a\nsimilar wear pattern to that identified on anvils used by captive chimpanzees. Wear patterns\non experimental anvils used in human pounding activities and archaeological pounding tools\nresemble those on tools used by the captive chimpanzees in this study.\nMore complex is the comparison between primate and archaeological active elements. The\nmost common active elements in the archaeological record from Olduvai Gorge are hammer-\nstones, which tend to be cobbles with traces of battering marks, and other types of pounding\ntools with different fractures; for example, hammerstones with fractured angles [13]. In our\nexperiments, captive chimpanzees had problems manipulating lava cobbles because the cob-\nbles were too small for the chimpanzees. Although only used for a short time, one cobble\n(O72, Fig 4B) showed a series of impact points that may replicate marks shown on some\narchaeological hammerstones (as these tools were used to crack less than 10 nuts and therefore\nhad a very short use).\nNevertheless, chimpanzee active elements show a very low degree of modification (as seen\non the spatial distribution section) compared with archaeological examples; they did not\ndevelop the large fractures found on archaeological active elements, suggesting that hominin\nhammerstones could have been used either for a longer period, or for another type of heavy-\nduty activity.\nDirect comparisons of chimpanzee and hominin pounding tools tend to show a higher\ndegree of modification of working surfaces on the latter. This characteristic may indicate that\nhominin tools were used in multiple tasks [13], whereas pounding tools used by captive chim-\npanzees were used solely to process nuts.\nDo chimpanzees produce flakes?. It has been argued that, from a technological perspec-\ntive, chimpanzees are able to obtain by-products similar to flakes found in the Oldowan\nrecord, which would support the correlation between chimpanzee nut cracking and the emer-\ngence of stone tool knapping [7, 11, 75, 76]. This theoretical model has been revised by Bril\nand colleagues [39], whose experiments show that stone tool knapping requires a higher level\nof cognitive capabilities than nut cracking (see [77] for a different point of view on the capabil-\nities of hominins and chimpanzees). Other long-term experimental programs with bonobos\n(Pan paniscus) have focused on teaching individuals to produce and use sharp edges, but clear\ntechnological differences are evident when their flakes are compared with Oldowan assem-\nblages [78, 79].\nDespite metrical and morphological similarities between by-products detached from nut\ncracking tools and archaeological flakes, the main difference between both groups relates to\nthe technological processes by which these flakes are produced (i.e. in flaking activities the\nknapper strikes the core to fracture it, whereas during nut cracking the target is the nut, not\nthe anvil).\nBy-products detached from nut cracking tools are not the result of a deliberate process of\nconchoidal fracture and do not indicate an understanding of fracture mechanics or the inten-\ntion to reduce a core to obtain flakes. Such characteristics can be recognized through a techno-\nlogical analysis of lithic assemblages in early Oldowan sites such as Gona [80] and Lokalalei 2C\n[43], and even in earlier stages of stone tool technology (the Lomekwian, [3]). In contrast, as\nFig 8. Comparis on of different passive element s showing similarities in the wear pattern.

Research-\ners have suggested that pounding activities could have led to stone knapping [11–13]. How-\never, it seems that between a pounding-like activity such as nut cracking and an intentional\nflaking activity there is an ‘intermediate step’, a stage in which the evolution of certain aspects\nrelated to the cognitive capabilities of hominins would have played an important role, and in\nwhich hominins would have acquired the skills necessary to systematically knap stone tools [2,\n39]. However, this stage would be difficult to recognize in the fossil record because of the lack\nof archaeologically visible remains (but see Proffitt et al, [81]).\nConclusions\nThis study examined pounding tools used by captive chimpanzees to process nuts, creating a\nreferential framework that enable comparison with archaeological pounding tools. Our analy-\nsis has shown that passive and active elements used by captive chimpanzees tend to yield a sim-\nilar wear pattern, especially on quartzite samples, which have crushed areas, impact points,\noccasional fractures located on areas close to the edges of the working surfaces, and a very low\ndegree of modification. These wear traces are associated with three different mechanisms by\nwhich individuals manipulate the active element and, owing to the resistant properties of the\nraw materials, all stigmas can be associated with a stone-against-stone process, in which frac-\ntures that mimic features of knapped flakes are occasionally detached.\nThis is the first study to feature captive chimpanzee use of quartzite from Olduvai Gorge,\nand thus provides additional information about characteristics that can be used to identify\npounding tools in the archaeological record and reconstruct hominin activities during the\nESA. As one of the major problems in analysing an archaeological assemblage is the recogni-\ntion of percussive activities, this reference collection provides an important comparative\nbenchmark.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, the emergence of tool-using behaviour in hominins is an\nimportant research topic. Recent discoveries at Lomekwi 3 [3] and cut-marked fossils from\nDikika (Ethiopia) [82] suggest that other non-Homo species were making and using stone\ntools. Studies of wild and captive chimpanzees offer a unique opportunity to model hominin\nbehaviour. A better understanding of chimpanzee material culture could also aid interpreta-\ntion of archaeological assemblages, highlighting the necessity for systematic comparisons\nbetween hominin and primate stone tools. Thus, future research should focus on increasing\nthe sample of primate pounding tools, adding detailed descriptions (not only from wild chim-\npanzees, but also from other living non-human primates such as capuchin monkeys and long-\ntailed macaques), and expanding comparisons with different ESA pounding tools. Detailed\ncomparative research programmes such as those described above, which combine aspects of\narchaeology and primatology, should help to improve our understanding of human evolution.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Table.
