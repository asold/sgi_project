  "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in various medical imaging tasks. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, CNNs generally cannot model long-range dependencies well, which are important for accurately identifying or mapping corresponding breast lesion features computed from unregistered multiple mammograms. This motivated us to leverage the architecture of Multi-view Vision Transformers to capture long-range relationships of multiple mammograms from the same patient in one examination. For this purpose, we employed local transformer blocks to separately learn patch relationships within four mammograms acquired from two-view (CC/MLO) of two-side (right/left) breasts. The outputs from different views and sides were concatenated and fed into global transformer blocks, to jointly learn patch relationships between four images representing two different views of the left and right breasts. To evaluate the proposed model, we retrospectively assembled a dataset involving 949 sets of mammograms, which included 470 malignant cases and 479 normal or benign cases. We trained and evaluated the model using a five-fold cross-validation method. Without any arduous preprocessing steps (e.g., optimal window cropping, chest wall or pectoral muscle removal, two-view image registration, etc.), our four-image (two-view-two-side) transformer-based model achieves case classification performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC = 0.818 ± 0.039), which significantly outperforms AUC = 0.784 ± 0.016 achieved by the state-of-the-art multi-view CNNs (p = 0.009). It also outperforms two one-view-two-side models that achieve AUC of 0.724 ± 0.013 (CC view) and 0.769 ± 0.036 (MLO view), respectively. The study demonstrates the potential of using transformers to develop high-performing computer-aided diagnosis schemes that combine four mammograms.",
