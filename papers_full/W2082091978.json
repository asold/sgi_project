    "abstract": "Losses in distribution transformers account for almost one third of overall transmission and distribution losses. Previous European Copper Institute studies indicated that improving energy efficiency of existing European stock of transformers by 40% would result in about 22 TWh energy savings equivalent to about 9 million tonne of CO2eq. SEEDT is one of the projects developed under Intelligent Energy - Europe programme which converts EU energy policy for today's energy challenges like energy efficiency. One the main goals is to update and scrutinize knowledge about energy efficiency in distribution transformers in Europe. This paper presents findings of analysis of existing situation.",
