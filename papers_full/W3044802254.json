INTRODUCTION\nThere are various power transformer condition monitoring\ntechniques such as frequency response analysis [1]–[3], par-\ntial discharge analysis [4]–[8] and Dissolved Gas Analysis\n(DGA) [9], [10] that have been employed in determining\nthe condition of power transformers. These techniques have\nbeneﬁted both manufacturers and operators in many ways,\nincluding obtaining information on the health of the power\ntransformer, estimating the remaining service life, increasing\nplant availability and planning of maintenance schedules.\nMost power transformers are ﬁlled with petroleum-based\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Arpan Kumar Pradhan\n.\ninsulating oil, which has excellent electrical insulating prop-\nerties. Apart from acting as an insulating and cooling agent,\ntransformer oil also can be used to determine the condition of\nthe power transformer [11], [12]. This is due to the breaking\nof carbon-hydrogen (C-H) and carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds in\nthe molecules of the oil when it is continuously subjected to\nelectrical and thermal stresses during operation.\nDegradation of transformer oil at low operating tempera-\nture has been recognized to produce extensive amounts of\nhydrogen (H 2) and methane (CH 4) gases along with trace\namounts of ethane (C 2H6) and ethylene (C 2H4) gases. Ther-\nmal decomposition of cellulose paper also produces carbon\ndioxide (CO 2), water vapor, acetylene (C 2H2) and carbon\nmonoxide (CO) gases as a result of high temperature within\n136374 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

A study of these dissolved gases alone\nwould not reveal any faults occurring in the transformer oil.\nConventionally, the ratio of fault gases produced are needed\nto diagnose the faults that commonly occur within the power\ntransformers. These well-established ratios include Rogers’s\nratio, Doemenburg ratio, Duval triangle techniques and IEC\nratio [13]–[15]. Duval triangle technique [16] is a common\ngraphical approach which plots normalized coordinates of\nthree types of gases, namely C 2H4, CH 4 and C 2H2, in a\ntriangular coordinate system. Data points that fall into certain\nzones correspond to a certain type of fault. Using the Duval\nTriangle approach, external partial discharges (PDs) in the\nform of corona, low energy electrical discharges (D1), high\nenergy electrical discharges (D2), thermal faults of temper-\natures below 300 ◦C (T1), thermal faults at temperatures in\nbetween the range of 300 ◦C and 700 ◦C (T2), thermal faults\nat temperatures way above 700 ◦C (T3), and combinations of\nelectrical and thermal faults (DT) [17] can be identiﬁed.\nHowever, the procedures involved from oil sampling to\nDGA test are tedious and has long results processing time.\nThe measurement involved in DGA is a direct and destructive\nmeasurement. The emergence of optical spectroscopy offers\ngreat promise in the ﬁeld of sensing, characterization and\nimaging. It is a direct, fast, non-invasive, and non-destructive\nanalytical tool for qualitative and quantitative analysis in\nboth research and industrial applications. For DGA appli-\ncations, infrared (IR) spectroscopy [18], [19] has been used\nto determine the absorption properties of dissolved gases in\ntransformer oil. Photo-acoustic spectroscopy has also been\na popular choice for researchers [20]–[24] to determine the\ndifferent types of dissolved gas in transformer oil at a certain\nwavelength. Raman [25], [26] and near-infrared (NIR) spec-\ntroscopy [27] have also demonstrated good progress in char-\nacterizing the optical absorption properties of dissolved gases\nin transformer oil. Although these techniques are excellent in\ncharacterizing the optical absorption properties of dissolved\ngases in transformer oil, there is a lack of further analysis and\nprediction involving these measurements. Determining the\nconcentration of dissolved gases is not sufﬁcient for power\nutilities to make any action plans for the respective power\ntransformer.\nThus, this paper proposes to categorize the fault condition\ndirectly based on the absorbance spectrum of the trans-\nformer oil measured in the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared\n(UV-Vis-NIR) region without determining the concentrations\nof the fault gases. While preliminary studies have been\ncarried out in [28], this work provides a detailed analy-\nsis of the speciﬁc optical properties with the established\nfault characteristics based on Duval Triangle. The correlation\nbetween the optical spectra in the region of 2140-2220 nm\nand the fault conditions are discussed. This work also pro-\nposes a procedure to incorporate data from the optical spec-\ntra of transformer oil into the Rapid Miner analysis tool\nfor fault prediction in power transformer. The data mining\nanalytic tool used in this study would provide a faster and\ncost-effective analysis to determine the absorbance threshold\nvalue as well as the range of the wavelength to categorize and\npredict the fault condition based on the absorbance spectrum\nof transformer oils.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nA total of 108 transformer oil samples were obtained from\nmultiple in-service power transformers with various life\nspans. Transformer oil samples collected in this study were\nsampled from the main tank and the OLTC tank of power\ntransformers. DGA was performed for all samples using gas\nchromatography, which complies with the International Elec-\ntrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60567 standard. The ﬁndings\nof the DGA have been further evaluated using the Duval\ntriangle method. There are two categories of Duval triangle,\nﬁrst category is for the main tank and the second category is\nfor the OLTC tank. Nonetheless, all the samples are evaluated\nusing the stated Duval triangle method for the main tank.\nThis is due to the difﬁculty in obtaining oil samples from\nthe main tank with D1 and D2, which mostly arises in the\nOLTC [29], [30]. Thus, OLTC oil samples were chosen and\nemployed to reﬂect oil samples from the main tank with\nD2 and D1 types of fault. It is worth noting that the discharge\nand high temperature thermal faults, which are categorized in\nD1, D2 and T3, are the most severe faults compared to that of\nPDs, T1, T2 and DT. Therefore, this study focuses on the fault\nprediction for D1, D2 and T3, and categorized other faults as\nOthers (O).\nIII. OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY MEASUREMENT\nThe Agilent Cary5000 spectrophotometer was used to con-\nduct optical spectroscopy measurement. The UV-Vis-NIR\nlight was transmitted through 1 cm path-length cuvettes\ncomprising the sampled transformer oil and the reference\noil sequentially, and the respective optical transmittance\nwas recorded. The absorbance values were then calculated\naccording to the Beer-lambert Law as shown in (1).\nAbsorbance =−log 10( S −B\nR −B) (1)\nwhere S is the transmittance of light transmitted through\nthe sampled transformer oil, R is the transmittance of light\ntransmitted through the reference oil, and B is the baseline\nmeasured by the instrument.\nThe transformer oil samples were evaluated in the range of\n200-3300 nm. The correlation between the absorbance spec-\ntrum derived from the optical analysis of the transformer oil\nsamples and their respective fault condition has been studied.\nFig. 1 demonstrates the optical absorbance spectra of several\ntransformer oil samples under various fault conditions at the\n2120-2220 nm region, and Table 1 shows their respective fault\ncondition. Samples obtained from main tank were labeled as\nA1 to A10 while the samples obtained from OLTC tank were\nlabeled as B1 to B11.\nBased on Fig. 1, it can be observed that samples with\nD2 and D1 fault conditions exhibit a peak absorbance approx-\nimately at 2172 nm. Most samples with D2 fault condition\nshow higher absorbance value compared to samples with\nVOLUME 8, 2020 136375\nN. A. Fauziet al.: Fault Prediction for Power Transformer\nFIGURE 1.

Duval fault condition based on dissolved gas limits.\nD1 fault condition. However, it can be seen that one of the\nsamples with D2 fault condition (indicated by red arrow in\nFig. 1) shows a lower absorbance compared to the samples\nwith D1 fault condition. This could suggest that the sam-\nple is just approaching to D2 fault condition from D1 fault\ncondition.\nAn absorbance peak at 2160 nm can also be observed and\nthis peak is produced by samples with T3 fault condition.\nTheir overall absorbance is approximately twice as low as\nthe absorbance for samples with D2 and D1 faults. Finally,\nthere are a few oil samples with very poor absorbance within\nthe wavelength range. These are the samples with other\nconditions.\nBased on the results obtained, if the sample exhibits a peak\nabsorbance at 2172 nm with absorbance value of 0.16 approx-\nimately, the power transformer is in critical condition of D1 or\nD2, and immediate action is required to resolve the problem.\nIf the sample exhibits a peak absorbance at 2160 nm with\nabsorbance value of 0.06 approximately, the power trans-\nformer is categorized as T3 fault condition and constant\nFIGURE 2. Algorithm that extract spectrum files and store into database.\nmonitoring of power transformer is recommended. If the sam-\nple does not exhibit any signiﬁcant absorbance peak in the\n2120-2220 nm range, the power transformer is in non-critical\ncondition. Optical characterization of transformer oil in the\nrange of 2120-2220 nm would allow the maintenance team\nto estimate the health of the power transformer and make\nappropriate decision on its maintenance and service schedule.\nTo statistically validate the trend observed on the optical\nabsorbance spectra, a total of 87 additional samples were\ncollected, and their optical spectra were obtained for data\nmining analysis. Due to the large number of samples tested\ndaily for power utilities, simple visualization on the opti-\ncal absorbance spectra of the samples for fault prediction\nwould be tedious. Thus, a data mining tool was proposed\nto determine the criteria or threshold for optical spectra of\ntransformer oil samples for different fault conditions.\nIV. DATA MINING ANALYTIC TOOL\nRapid Miner is a data mining analytic tool which is used to\nanalyze data and support various techniques of data mining.\nA transformer oil sample search tool was constructed by using\nRapid Miner server as shown in Fig. 2. The Rapid Miner\nwas used to extract the optical spectra ﬁles and store into\nthe database It is a web-based tool that searches for optical\nspectrum of transformer oil sample that meet the search\ncriteria within the research constraint and helps to identify\nthe accuracy of this monitoring method when it is applied on\nother optical spectrum of transformer oil.\nA continuous iteration process that searches for the best\noptical absorbance-wavelength combination was then carried\nout for further optimization. The algorithm prioritized the\naccuracy for fault prediction instead of normal condition\nprediction as the former is the more crucial criteria. The\nﬂowchart of the overall process is illustrated in Fig. 3. Firstly,\nthe optical spectrum data measured using the spectropho-\ntometer was extracted from each ﬁle and uploaded into the\nsystem to store all the spectra into a database to begin the\ndata processing using the algorithm as shown in Fig. 4.\nIn the algorithm, each spectrum ﬁle was read and the column\nlabel was generated based on the ﬁle name of the spectrum\nﬁle, which is the sample ID of the measured sample. The\nspectrum was then joined into the existing table and store\nin the memory. At the end of the main algorithm as shown\nin Fig. 2, all the sample absorbance spectra were stored in a\ntable as shown in Table 2.\nThe spectra data in the database were then further pro-\ncessed by the peak-ﬁnding algorithm as shown in Fig. 5.\nIn the algorithm, the wavelength was set to 2140-2200 nm\nand each spectrum was pre-processed using moving average.\nMoving average algorithm was developed to smooth out any\n136376 VOLUME 8, 2020\nN.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nBased on the analytical results of DGA, the Duval triangle\nanalysis was performed on all the results to assess the condi-\ntion of the power transformer. Several results can be obtained\nfrom the Duval triangle analysis, however for this study,\nthe Duval triangle analysis were simpliﬁed and the results\nwere mapped into High/Low transformer concern level as\nshown in Table 5.\nA peak absorbance threshold was deﬁned to generate\npredicted High/Low transformer concern level based on the\npeak absorbance values, where the values lower than the\nthreshold was set as Low and those higher was set as High.\nA summary of the prediction accuracy on Duval triangle\nanalysis results using the UV-Vis-NIR spectra analytics with\nthe optimum absorbance threshold is shown in Table 6.\nThe optimum threshold is obtained, as absorbance value\nis equal to 0.02 where the conﬁdence level for predicted\nHigh value is the highest. Table 6 indicates that 16 out\nTABLE 7.

Meanwhile, in term of prediction\nfor the true Low, 60% of the samples were predicted correctly.\nThe value of the overall accuracy and conﬁdence level for\npredicted High is shown in Table 7.\nTable 8 shows a number of random results out of 108\nsamples of the prediction on Duval triangle analysis results\nusing UV-Vis-NIR spectra. From all the samples, it gives\n64.8% correct diagnosis (True High, Predicted High and True\nLow, Predicted Low) and 33.3% are overestimating (True\nLow, Predicted High) which sum up to 98.1% accuracy in\ndetection of critical oil samples with only 1.90% underesti-\nmation (True High, Predicted Low) of the samples. Therefore,\nby using optical spectrum of transformer oil and data min-\ning analysis, the proposed alternative method in this study\nis a cost-effective and time-saving which can be used as a\n136378 VOLUME 8, 2020\nN.

CONCLUSION\nThis research focuses on the optical characterization of trans-\nformer oil in relation to the fault conditions based on DGA\nresults and Duval’s triangle interpretation. The ﬁndings indi-\ncate that samples with D2 and D1 fault conditions exhibit\nhigh optical absorbance peaks near 2172 nm. On the other\nhand, an absorbance peak near 2160 nm indicates T3 fault\ncondition in the power transformer. Additionally, the data\nmining analytic tool used in this study also provides a quick\ncomplementing analysis to determine the absorbance thresh-\nold value as well as the range of the detection wavelength, for\nthe categorization of power transformer conditions based on\noptical spectrum of transformer oil. The performance of the\noptical spectroscopy technique integrated with data analytic\ntool was analyzed and it was found that the technique con-\ntributes to a high accuracy of 98.1% in fault prediction. The\noptical characterization of transformer oil in the NIR region\nis undoubtedly a more cost-effective and faster alternative to\ndistinguish T3, D2 and D1 faults from less severe faults in\npower transformers. It is evident that optical spectroscopy\nintegrated with data analytics tool is a reliable technique\nto complement the existing comprehensive transformer oil\ntesting method. It minimizes the frequency of routine DGA\ntest and interpretation using the Duval Triangle.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors thank the technical assistance and advice from\nthe Expert Oil Diagnostic Services (EtODS) of TNB Labs\nSdn.
