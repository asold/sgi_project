In this paper, we describe metrics for mea-\nsuring political bias in GPT-2 generation and propose a re-\ninforcement learning (RL) framework for mitigating political\nbiases in generated text. By using rewards from word em-\nbeddings or a classiﬁer, our RL framework guides debiased\ngeneration without having access to the training data or re-\nquiring the model to be retrained. In empirical experiments\non three attributes sensitive to political bias (gender, loca-\ntion, and topic), our methods reduced bias according to both\nour metrics and human evaluation, while maintaining read-\nability and semantic coherence.\n1 Introduction\nLarge-scale language models (LMs) can generate human-\nlike text and have shown promise in many Natural Lan-\nguage Generation (NLG) applications such as dialogue gen-\neration (Zhang et al. 2020; Peng et al. 2020) and machine\ntranslation (Yang et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020). These models\nare often trained on large quantities of unsupervised data—\nfor example, GPT-2 (Radford et al. 2019) is trained on a\ndataset of 8 million unlabeled web pages. Although training\ndata is typically collected with content diversity in consid-\neration, other factors, such as ideological balance, are often\nignored. This raises a couple of important questions:\nDo current large-scale generative language models,\nsuch as GPT-2, perpetuate political biases towards a\ncertain ideological extreme? And if so, can they be\nguided towards politically unbiased generation?\nLM generation typically relies on a given text prompt,\ne.g., “I’m from Massachusetts. I will vote... ”, and we notice\nthat the demographic (i.e., “Massachusetts”) and topic at-\ntributes within the prompts have substantial inﬂuence on the\nideological tendencies of the generated texts. In this work,\nwe study the ideological biases of texts generated by GPT-2\nwith respect to three attributes: gender, location and topic.\nWe propose and investigate two bias types: 1) Indirect\nBias, which measures bias of texts generated using prompts\nCopyright © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nwith particular keywords of the aforementioned attributes,\nand 2) Direct Bias, which measures bias in texts generated\nusing prompts that have directly ideological triggers (e.g.,\ndemocrat, republican) in addition to keywords of aforemen-\ntioned attributes. Table 1 shows four samples of text gen-\nerated by off-the-shelf GPT-2 with different attribute key-\nwords in the prompts—all samples exhibit political bias.\nFor example, when triggered with a prompt including mar-\nijuana, the generated text tends to present a favorable atti-\ntude (e.g., “I believe it should be legal and not regulated. ”),\nwhich is mostly a liberal stance. More interestingly, even\na prompt including a conservative trigger (republican) re-\nsults in generation which leans to the liberal side (“vote for\nHillary... ”).\nThe ethical implications of bias in NLG have started to re-\nceive considerable attention in discussions around the social\nimpact of AI ( Sheng et al. 2020, 2019; Wallace et al. 2019;\nBordia and Bowman 2019). Given the ever-growing number\nof down-stream models that rely on GPT-2 (and other LMs),\nit is of utmost importance, and a matter of fairness, for these\nLMs to generate politically unbiased text.\nIn this paper, we deﬁnewhat political bias is in generative\nLMs and present how to mitigate such bias during genera-\ntion. Speciﬁcally, our contributions are three-fold:\n• We propose two bias metrics (Indirect Bias and Direct\nBias) to quantify the political bias in language model gen-\neration (x3). Although in this work we focus on political\nbias based on three attributes (gender,location and topic),\nour framework can be easily extended to other types of\nbias and different attributes.\n• We present a reinforcement learning based framework for\nmitigating political bias in two modes: word-embedding\nguided debias and classiﬁer-guided debias (x4). Since our\nframework neither accesses the original training data nor\nretrains the model from scratch, it can be generalized to\nother large-scale LMs with minimum modiﬁcation.\n• We systematically evaluate our methods with the pro-\nposed metrics, ﬁnding that it successfully reduces politi-\ncal bias while maintaining reasonable ﬂuency (x6.1-x6.3).\nFurthermore, human evaluation conﬁrms that our meth-\nods successfully mitigate the political bias without sacri-\nﬁcing readability and semantic coherence (x6.4).\nTheThi rty-Fi fth AAA ICon ferenceon A rti fi ci al Intellig ence(AAAI-21)\n14857\nAttribute\nBias Type Prompts with [ATTR] ﬁlled + Vanilla GPT-2 Generation\nhealthcare\n(T\nopic) Indirect I want to talk about [TOPIC] marijuana, because\n+\nI believe it should be legal and not regulated.\nleaning blue\n(Location) Indirect About\nvoting, people from [LOCATION] Virginia will\n+ v\note.

For Direct Bias, besides the keywords\nreplacement, we also trigger the generation with a given ideology (L: liberal or C: conservative).\n2 Related Work\nTo mitigate LM bias, common approaches include modify-\ning the training data through data augmentation, manipulat-\ning word embeddings, and adjusting predictions to produce\nmore fair classiﬁcations. This section explores this prior art.\nData Augmentation. Many types of bias (e.g., gender,\nrace, occupation, etc.) can be attributed to disproportionate\nnumber of data samples from different classes. Kusner et al.\nﬁrst proposed counterfactual fairness, which treats data\nsamples equally in actual and counterfactual demographic\ngroups. Zhao et al. mitigated gender bias by augmenting\noriginal data with gender-swapping and training a unbiased\nsystem on the union of two datasets. Other augmentation\ntechniques have reduced gender bias in hate speech detec-\ntion (Park, Shin, and Fung 2018; Liu et al. 2020), knowledge\ngraph building (Mitchell et al. 2019) and machine transla-\ntion (Stanovsky, Smith, and Zettlemoyer 2019).\nEmbedding Manipulation. Societal biases have also\nbeen reﬂected in word embeddings (Garg et al. 2018). To\nmitigate gender bias in Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013),\nBolukbasi et al. altered the embedding space by forcing the\ngender-neutral word embeddings orthogonal to the gender\ndirection deﬁned by a set of classiﬁer picked gender-biased\nwords. Zhao et al. proposed an improved method called GN-\nGloVe, which separated the GloVe (Pennington, Socher, and\nManning 2014) embedding space into neutral and gender\ndimensions, and jointly trained with a modiﬁed loss func-\ntion to obtain gender-neutral embeddings. These methods,\nhowever, can not be easily adapted to recent LMs because\nthe embedding of LMs are often context-aware and encoded\nwith other meta-features such as positions (Reif et al. 2019).\nHuang et al. reduced sentiment bias in recent LMs and re-\ntrained Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019b) and GPT-2 (Rad-\nford et al. 2019) using a fairness loss to reduce sentiment\nbiased.\nPrediction Adjustment. Finally, there is related art in ma-\nchine learning fairness research seeking to produce “fair”\nclassiﬁers or unbiased feature representations (Zhao et al.\n2019; Donini et al. 2018; Misra et al. 2016; Kamishima et al.\n2012). For instance, Zhang, Lemoine, and Mitchell use an\nadversarial network where the generator attempted to pre-\nvent the discriminator from identifying gender in an analogy\ncompletion task. All these works, however focus on classiﬁ-\ncation tasks rather than exploring the bias in LM generation.\nAlthough these approaches can be effective, it can be\nchallenging to apply them to pretrained large-scale LMs,\nsince 1) the corpus used to train LMs is not always pub-\nlicly available, and 2) it is often costly to retrain large-scale\nLMs with augmented data. In this paper, we will propose an\napproach that neither accesses the original training data and\nnor retrains the language model.\n3 Political Bias Measurement\nWe ﬁrst introduce the notation used throughout the paper\nand brieﬂy describe the problem setup. We then formally\ndeﬁne the political bias in generative language models.\n3.1 Notation\nSensitive Attributes. In this paper, we explore three sen-\nsitive attributes: gender, location, topic. Each attribute con-\ntains multiple options (e.g.,male is an option of gender,blue\nstate is an option for location), each of which can be exem-\npliﬁed by keywords (e.g., Jacob is a keyword formale, Mas-\nsachusetts is a keyword forblue states). Moving forward, we\nrefer to a keyword asa, an option as o, and an attribute asA.\nLanguage Modeling. Auto-regressive LMs are typically\ntriggered by a prompt (a span of of pre-deﬁned tokens) (Rad-\nford et al. 2019). In our case, given a prompt  , a LM will\ngenerate a sequence of T tokens X = [xt] for t 2[1 : T]\nwhere xt is given by:\nxt \u0018argmax\n^xt\nPr(^xt) = LM(x1:t\u00001j ) : (1)\nWhen computing indirect bias, each prompt is ﬁlled in with\nan keyword a. When computing direct bias, each prompt is\nﬁlled in with both an keyword aand a liberal (L) or conser-\nvative (C) ideology injection.\nBias Judgement. To measure the extent of political bias in\noutputs generated by LMs, we pretrain a political ideology\nclassiﬁer fjudge. For a given generated sequence of tokens\nX, it computes a score y = fjudge(X) 2[0;1] where y !0\n14858\nindicates liberal bias and y!1 indicates conservative bias.\nFollowing prior work on fairness in machine learning (Zhao\net al. 2019; Zhao and Gordon 2019), we deﬁne the base rate\nof a given set of texts as the distribution of corresponding\nprobabilities of each text being classiﬁed as class 1 by our\npretrained classiﬁer.\n3.2 Deﬁnition\nThis section deﬁnes two methods for measuring the extent\nof bias in texts generated by a LM.\nINDIRECT BIAS For indirect prompts, which take in only\na keyword without any speciﬁed political biases, indirect\nbias measures the amount of bias our pretrained classiﬁer\ndetects in texts generated using keywords from a speciﬁc\noption compared with the bias in texts generated using key-\nwords from all options.\nFormally, we consider two variables in this metric:\n1. Xo is the set of texts generated with prompts using every\nkeyword associated with a singlegiven option o, and\n2. X8o2A is the set of texts generated with prompts using\nevery keyword from all optionsbelonging to attribute A.\nNow, the indirect bias is computed using the distance be-\ntween the base rates of Xo and X8o2A:\nBindirect(o;A) := \u0001BR(Xo;X8o2A) ; (2)\nwhere \u0001BRis the second order Sliced Wasserstein Distance\n(SWD) (Jiang et al. 2019; Rabin et al. 2011) between the\nbase rates (computed by fjudge) of two sets of texts. The\ntheoretical underpinning of this bias is conditional indepen-\ndence: if the political bias of LM generation is independent\nof option o, we should have Pr(y= 1j \\o) = Pr(y= 1j ).\nIn other words, if the LM is unbiased on option o, its base\nrate given o should equal the option-invariant base rate.\nTherefore, the distance between these two base rates mea-\nsures the dependence of generation on a certain option o.\nDIRECT BIAS As another metric, we also consider direct\nbias, which measures the extent of bias in texts generated\nby LMs when given prompts that directly contain political\nideology information. We deﬁne direct bias as the difference\nin indirect bias of generated texts when given liberal-leaning\n(L) versus conservative-leaning (C) prompts:\nBdirect := jBL\nindirect(o;A) \u0000BC\nindirect(o;A)j: (3)\nBy “leaking” ideology information to the LM directly\nthrough prompts with political leanings, we expect gener-\nated text to be politically biased. If an LM is able to gener-\nate equally biased texts given both liberal and conservative\nprompts, then the direct bias should be close to 0. If the LM\nis not able to generate adequately-biased texts given prompts\nwith a political leaning (e.g., if an LM is not able to gener-\nate conservative leaning texts given a conservative leaning\nprompt), however, our direct bias metric will be positive.\nUnlike indirect bias, which solely relies on the LM itself\nto establish connections between attributes and political ide-\nology, directly-biased prompts explicitly guide generation in\na speciﬁed direction, allowing us to examine the sensitive-\nness of LMs to political bias directly.\n4 Debias through Reinforced Calibration\nDifferent from existing methods that add fairness loss and\nretrain an unbiased LM from scratch (Huang et al. 2019),\nwe keep the main architecture of GPT-2 unchanged but cal-\nibrate the bias during the generation. As shown in Figure 1,\nwe add a debias stage (either using word embeddings or a\nclassiﬁer) between the softmax and argmax function, cali-\nbrating the vanilla generation in several iterations of rein-\nforced optimization to produce unbiased tokens.\nargmaxsoftmax\nMode 1\nMode 2\nargmaxsoftmax\n(a) Mode 1: Word Emb. Debias (b)Mode 2: Cls. Guided Debias\n0.9\n0.4\nL C\nLM\nLM\nFigure 1: Two modes of our RL-guided debias method.\nIn the framework of reinforcement learning, we deﬁne the\nstate at step t as all the generated sequences before t (i.e.,\nst = x1:t), and the action at step tas the t-th output token\n(i.e., at = xt). We take the softmax output of the last hid-\nden states as the policy \u0019\u0012, because it can be viewed as the\nprobability we choose token xt (action at) given the state\nst = x1:t (Dai et al. 2019a; Dathathri et al. 2019). We also\nprepare 1) a pre-deﬁned political biased words set wL (as\nfor liberal) and wC (as for conservative) which are extracted\nfrom the Media Cloud dataset using TF-IDF, and 2) a pre-\ntrained GPT-2 based classiﬁerfdebias to provide guidance for\ndebias, which differs the bias judgement classiﬁerfjudge pre-\nviously deﬁned. They will be used in M ODE 1: Word Em-\nbedding Debias and M ODE 2: Classiﬁer Guided Debias re-\nspectively.\n4.1 Debias Reward\nInspired by the objective function used in PPO (Proximal\nPolicy Optimal) algorithm (Schulman et al. 2017), we deﬁne\nthe single-step debias reward as follows:\nR(xd\nt) = Et\n\u0014\u0019\u0012d (atjst)\n\u0019\u0012(atjst) D[1;2](xd\nt)\n\u0015\n; (4)\nwhere D[1;2](xd\nt) is the debias gain that comes from either\nMODE 1 (x4.3) or M ODE 2 (x4.4), which serves as a guide\nsignal for the debias generation. As part of the off-policy\ntricks (Munos et al. 2016), we take the ratio of debias policy\n\u0019\u0012d and the vanilla policy \u0019\u0012 as a coefﬁcient, so that the re-\nward is based on the trajectory (i.e., (st;at) pairs) produced\nby the vanilla policy instead of the debiased one which is\npart of our optimization goal.\n14859\n4.2 M ODE 1: Word Embedding Debias\nOne of the proven methodologies used in the unbiased word\nembedding literature is to force the neutral words have equal\ndistance to groups of sensitive words (e.g.,male and female)\nin the embedding space (Zhao et al. 2018b; Park, Shin, and\nFung 2018; Bolukbasi et al. 2016). Instead of using it as a\ngoal to train unbiased LMs, we take it as the rule to pick the\nunbiased token at each step generation. Speciﬁcally, given\nthe liberal and conservative words list wL and wC, the debias\ngain D[1](xd\nt) of token xd\nt is:\nD[1](xd\nt) =\n\r\r\r\r\n\r\nX\nw2wL\ndist(xd\nt;w)\n\r\r\r\r\n\r\n2\n2\n+\n\r\r\r\r\n\r\nX\nw2wC\ndist(xd\nt;w)\n\r\r\r\r\n\r\n2\n2\n\u0000\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\nX\nw2wL\ndist(xd\nt;w) \u0000\nX\nw2wC\ndist(xd\nt;w)\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\n1\n;\n(5)\nwhere dist(xd\nt;w) measures the distance between the gener-\nated debiased token xd\nt and biased words from both groups.\nThe distance in embedding space is estimated by the neg-\native inner product of the t-th step hidden states h\u0012d\n1:t (ac-\ncumulated till t) and the embedded vector of w by the LM\nembedding layers:\ndist(xd\nt;w) = \u0000log(softmax(h\u0012d\n1:t) \u0001emb(w)): (6)\nIn general the L2 terms in Equation 5 will push the picked\ntoken far away from the bias words, and the negative L1\nterm will penalize picking the word whose distance to two\ngroups are not equal. At each step we maximize such gain to\nshift the current step hidden states h\u0012d\n1:t towards the unbiased\ndirection.\n4.3 M ODE 2: Classiﬁer Guided Debias\nWord embedding debias could be problematic if the bias is\nnot purely word level (Bordia and Bowman 2019). Also,\npoor quality pre-deﬁned bias words could affect the de-\nbias performance remarkably (Huang et al. 2019). Thus we\npresent a more advanced mode that leverages the political\nbias classiﬁer to guide the debias generation.\nFor a given span of generated text xd\n1:t = [xd\n1;xd\n2;:::x d\nt],\nthe total debias gain can be computed as a summation of\nweighted gain collected at each step generation:\nD[2](xd\n1:t) = 1\nt\ntX\ni=1\n\rt\u0000ir(xd\ni) \u0019 1\n\u001c + 1\ntX\ni=t\u0000\u001c\n\rt\u0000ir(xd\ni);\n(7)\nwhere \r 2 (0;1) is the discounting factor which assigns\nhistorical tokens less weights. To reduce the computational\ncomplexity during generation, we set a window size \u001c to\nlimit the back-tracking history length, and use the genera-\ntion during the period [t\u0000\u001c;t] to estimate the whole current\nsequence. The gain at i-th step is:\nr(xd\ni) = \u0000[ylog Pr(y= 1jhd\n1:i) +\n(1 \u0000y) logPr(y= 0jhd\n1:i)];\n(8)\nwhich is similar to cross-entropy loss but here we try to max-\nimize it to penalize the generation resulting in one of the\nextremes, while to encourage neutral selection (i.e., Pr(y =\n1) = Pr(y = 0) ! 0:5). The probability output of the\nbias classiﬁer fdebias(hd\n1:t) is within [0;1] for either class,\nand y = f0;1gdepending on whether the probability is\nabove threshold 0:5. As in M ODE 1, we use the accumu-\nlated hidden states till tas a reasonable estimate of current\nstep generation.\n4.4 Reinforced Calibration\nBesides the debias reward, we also consider the Kull-\nback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the vanilla distribu-\ntion of \u0012 and the debiased \u0012d as an auxiliary constraint in\ncase the debias policy drifts too far away from the vanilla\npolicy causing low readability. The procedure of our debias\ncalibration is shown in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1: Reinforced Political Debias\nInput: Bias words lists wL and wC, pretrained bias\nclassiﬁer fdebias, KL-divergence threshold \u001b.\nfor t= 1;2;::: do\nGenerate (atjst) by vanilla policy \u0019\u0012 as\ntrajectories;\nif MODE 1 then\nCompute D(xd\nt) as in MODE 1 (Eq. 5);\nelse if MODE 2 then\nCompute D(xd\nt) as in MODE 2 (Eq. 7);\nend\nEstimate reward R(xd\nt) with D(xd\nt);\nCompute policy update\n\u0012d  argmax\n\u0012\n\u0015tR(xd\nt)(\u0012) \u0000KL(\u0012jj\u0012d) (9)\nby taking Ksteps of SGD (via Adam);\nif KL(\u0012jj\u0012d) \u00152\u001bthen\n\u0015t+1 = \u0015t / 2;\nelse if KL(\u0012jj\u0012d) \u0014\u001b=2 then\n\u0015t+1 = 2\u0015t;\nend\nReturn the debiased policy \u0019\u0012d ;\nend\nWe set the balance parameter \u0015t and target divergence\n\u001b to adaptively balance the strength of debias (debias re-\nward) and semantic coherence (KL constraint) based on the\ncurrent step KL divergence. The debias algorithm is called\n“calibration” because it is not generating unbiased text from\nscratch but rather performing debias on the hidden states\n(with param \u0012) of vanilla generation. The algorithm will pro-\nduce a debiased policy \u0019\u0012d with which we can generate text\nconforming to political neutrality.\n5 Experimental Setup\nIn order to implement our framework, we train a generative\nLM, a political bias judgement classiﬁer (fjudge), and a bias\nclassiﬁer for M ODE 2 of our debiasing framework (fdebias).\n14860\nFigure 2: (a) and (b): The UMAP 2D visualization of 5,606 sentences generated by vanilla GPT-2 when the sentence embeddings\nare encoding output of (a) not pretrained XLNet, (b) pretrained XLNet on Media Cloud Dataset (F 1 =0.98). (c) and (d) are\nvisualization of debiased sentences by M ODE 1 and MODE 2. The embeddings of (c) (d) are both from pretrained XLNet. We\nmark the class of each sentence (L / C ) labeled by the pretrained XLNet classiﬁer.\nMedia Cloud Dataset. We collect a large-scale politi-\ncal ideology dataset containing N\u0019260k (full) news arti-\ncles from 10 liberal and conservative media outlets1 through\nMedia Cloud API. 2 The ideology of the news outlets is\nretrieved from a survey of news consumption by the Pew\nResearch Center.3 We removed all punctuation except ,.?!\nand the press names in the articles to avoid label leaking\n(e.g., “(CNN) - ”). We only considered the ﬁrst 100 to-\nkens in each article and cut off the rest, since 100 was also\nthe max sequence length for GPT-2 generation. We used a\ndistribution-balanced version from our prior work (Liu, Jia,\nand V osoughi 2021; Liu et al. 2021) (N\u0019120k, balanced) for\nbetter classiﬁer performance and further split the data into\ntraining, validation, and test sets by the ratio f70%, 15%,\n15%g, maintaining the original class distributions.\nModels. We chose the off-the-shelf GPT-2 medium\n(trained on a corpus of size 40GB, with 355M parameters)\nas the generative LM for our study. Forfjudge, we ﬁne-tuned\nXLNet (2019) (using the default parameters) on the Me-\ndia Cloud dataset achieving an F1 of 0.984. We also tested\nGRN + attention (2016), FastText (2017), Transformer Net-\nwork (2017), and BERT (2019), but none of them outper-\nformed the ﬁne-tuned XLNet.\nFor fdebias, we trained a classiﬁer using the Media Cloud\ndataset with the encoder of GPT-2 medium plus dense\n([1024, 1024]) + activation (tanh) + dense ([1024, 2]) lay-\ners. Since we used GPT-2 as the generative LM, we chose\nthe GPT-2 encoder for fdebias as gradient consistency.\nParameters & Settings. We used the default GPT-2 set-\ntings. For each keyword a belonging to a certain option o,\nwe generate 10 samples with length of 100 tokens onM=10\nprompts. Thus, for a given option, we generate jaj\u0001 M \u000110\nsamples.

The full list of attributes, keywords, and the\nprompts can be found in Appendix A and B.\nOn average, the vanilla generation of 100-token se-\nquences took about 0.8s, debias by MODE 1 generation took\nabout 1.1s and by M ODE 2 took about 1.3s on a RTX 2080\nGPU. The debias strength parameter \u0015is set to 0.6 initially\nby default but we also explored the performance under \u0015=\nf0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9g(see x6.2). We picked 250 bias words\nfor either ideology in MODE 1 and set the backtracking win-\ndow size to 5 in M ODE 2. There were 15 iterations of SGD\ncalibration in both modes. The KL-divergence threshold \u001b\nis set to 0.02 and 0.05 for the two modes respectively.\n6 Evaluation\nIn this section, we evaluate our proposed method in terms of\nmitigating political bias (x6:1) and retaining ﬂuency (x6:2).\nMoreover, we also use manual human judgement to evaluate\nmodels in terms of bias, readability, and coherence (x6:4).\n6.1 Mitigating Political Bias\nWe evaluate the generated texts from three models: vanilla\nGPT-2 (baseline), word embedding debiased GPT-2, and\nclassiﬁer guided debiased GPT-2. As a qualitative evalua-\ntion, we take a clustering approach to visualize the bias of\nsentences generated using indirect prompts. For quantitative\nevaluation, we compute indirect and direct bias before and\nafter applying debias calibration.\nUMAP Visualization. We visualize XLNet embeddings\nof texts generated by three models: our baseline and our two\nRL-debias methods. For the baseline, we use two modes to\nembed generated texts: (1) pretrained XLNet without any\npolitical ideology ﬁne-tuning (Figure 2(a)), and (2) pre-\ntrained XLNet with political ideology ﬁne-tuning (Figure\n2(b)). Notably, embeddings of baseline generations sepa-\nrate into noticeable clusters even when visualized using XL-\nNet without political ideology pretraining, and become even\nmore clear when using an XLNet classiﬁer that is ﬁne-tuned\nfor political ideology classiﬁcation.

The reduction of\nbias is marked with #regarding to the bias of baseline. As expected, politically contentious topics such as Immigration have\nhigher bias.\npolitical ideology classiﬁcation. Qualitatively, it appears that\nthe clusters in (c) and (d) are much less separated, suggest-\ning that sentences generated by our debiased models are less\nseparable by the XLNet political ideology classiﬁer.\nIndirect & Direct Bias Reduction. To quantify the effect\nof our debiasing method, we compute indirect and direct\nbias reduction of generated text from our two models com-\npared with the baseline (Table 2). Foremost, we see that for\nall three attributes, overall, both our proposed methods sig-\nniﬁcantly reduce indirect and direct bias, and the classiﬁer\nguided debias generally outperforms the word embedding\ndebias. It is interesting to see that in options Healthcare and\nImmigration, and in option Female, word embedding debias\nreceives even lower direct bias score, which can be partially\nattributed to the last distance balancing term in Equation 5.\n6.2 Trade-off between Debias and Fluency\nIn preliminary experiments, we observed that debiased gen-\nerations sometimes contain more syntactic errors when us-\ning larger debias strength parameter (\u0015 !1), meaning\nthat the model mitigates the bias aggressively but sacri-\nﬁces the semantic ﬂuency to some extent. Thus, in this sec-\ntion, we examine the trade-off between the bias reduction\nand the generation ﬂuency. To measure perplexity, we use\nkenLM (Heaﬁeld 2011) to train three separate LMs on the\nvanilla generation for our three attributes. Here, we focus\non the classiﬁer-guided debias method, which has the better\nperformance of the two rewards we study. As shown in Ta-\nble 3 we see that, in general, models trained with larger \u0015\ngenerate texts that have higher both indirect and direct bias\nbut also have higher perplexity (less ﬂuency), which con-\nﬁrms our original observation.

PPL: perplexity.\nbe the only one that does not access to the original train-\ning data and there has potential to be adapted to LM gen-\neration debias. We add a simple retrieving stage upon the\ntrained IN-GloVe model (Ideology-Neutral Glove, not orig-\ninal Gender-Neutral): every time the generation encounters\nthe pre-deﬁned biased words, replace them with one of the\ntop-10 most similar word retrieved from the IN-GloVe. In\nthis way we approximate using prior word embedding de-\nbias method in current generative LMs. We also prepare\na Naive method, which just randomly replaces pre-deﬁned\nbias words with the most similar word in terms of off-the-\nshelf Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013). Their performances\ncompared with two proposed methods are shown in Ta-\nble 5. Naive method marginally reduces the bias, while IN-\nGloVe performs similar to Naive method, suggesting that\nword-level rather than contextual method cannot truly de-\nbias. Compared with prior methods, which simply replace\nwords in already generated text, our proposed method gen-\nerates completely new unbiased text, which likely explains\nthe increased perplexity.\n6.4 Human Judgement\nAs further evaluation, we recruited N=170 MTurk partic-\nipants to manually examine generated texts for 1) Debias\n(i.e., “How biased is text you read?”Answer is from 1-\nextremely unbiased to 7-extremely biased); 2) Readability\n(i.e., “How well-written is the text?”Answer is from 1-not\nreadable at all to 7-very readable); and 3) Coherence (i.e.,\n“Is the generated text coherent with the writing prompt?”\nDebias Readability\nCoherence\nMean p Mean p Mean p\nBaseline 4.72\n- 4.33 - 4.35 -\nIN-GloVe 4.38 .00*** 3.81 .00*** 4.20 .29\nOurs: Emb. 4.15 .00*** 4.46 .20 4.46 .41\nOurs: Cls. 4.25 .00*** 4.93 .00*** 4.55 .12\nTable 6: Human evaluation results on bias reduction, read-\nability, and coherence to the given prompts.

(* corre-\nsponds to p< 0:05, ** to p< 0:01 and *** to p< 0:001.)\nAnswer is from 1-strongly disagree to 7-strongly agree).\nEach participant was randomly assigned eight paragraphs\ngenerated by four methods (Baseline, IN-GloVe, Emb., and\nCls.). The participants were informed that the generations\nwere continuations of the underlined prompts, but they did\nnot know the exact method used to generate the paragraph.\nWe used paired samples t-tests to examine the difference\nbetween baseline and other methods in terms of coherence,\nperceived bias, and readability. As Table 6 shows, our word-\nembedding debias method was the least biased (M =4.25),\nand the classiﬁer-guided debias method had the best read-\nability (M=4.93) and highest coherence score (M=4.55). IN-\nGloVe mitigated bias not as much as our methods and its\nreadability was signiﬁcantly worse than Baseline (M =3.81\nvs. M=4.33, t=6.67, p<: 001***). No signiﬁcant difference\nexisted for coherence among all four methods.\n7 Limitations\nAlthough the bias metrics we study capture the purported\nphenomenon relatively well, they certainly have limitations.\nFor instance, the indirect bias metric measures the extent of\nbias from texts generated by one option, but it does not tell\nus the directionality of the bias. Moreover, as we study po-\nlitical bias in this paper, our metrics focus on only binary\nclasses (liberal and conservative) and would require non-\ntrivial modiﬁcation in order to be extended into types of bias\nthat are non-binary (e.g., emotional bias, normally catego-\nrized by nine directions (Huang et al. 2018)).\n8 Conclusion\nIn this work, we have discussed two metrics for measuring\npolitical bias in language model generation and presented\na framework to mitigate such bias that requires neither ex-\ntra data nor retraining. As more potentially-biased LMs are\nadopted in AI applications, it is a growing concern that the\npolitical bias will be ampliﬁed if fairness is not taken into\nconsidering. Our method is especially meaningful in such\ncontexts, since the training data of LMs are normally not\npublicly available and training a new large-scale LM from\nscratch is costly.\n14863\nAcknowledgments\nWe sincerely thank the reviewers for their insightful com-\nments and suggestions that helped improve the paper.
