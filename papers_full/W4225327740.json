Email: tobias.wolfram@uni-bielefeld.de.\n1\n1 Introduction24\nPsychological, life-course, and behavioural prediction is an increasingly recognized and timely goal (Berk25\net al., 2019; Chandler et al., 2011; Cranmer and Desmarais, 2017; Hofman et al., 2021; Kleinberg et al.,26\n2015; Watts, 2014; Yarkoni and Westfall, 2017). One driving motivation is to identify individuals at27\nrisk for negative outcomes and inform the timing and type of intervention, with earlier work focusing28\non specific outcomes such as the onset of mental health problems (Tate et al., 2020). A recent study29\n(Salganik et al., 2020) – the ‘Fragile Families Challenge’ (FFC) – utilised the ‘common task method’30\n(Donoho, 2017), concluding with a somewhat pessimistic outlook. One hundred and sixty research groups31\nleveraged 12,942 social survey variables from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS),32\nmaking available recent advances in computational power and machine learning algorithms which are33\nincreasingly popularised in the social sciences (Rahal et al., 2021). The most successful predictions34\nexplained only approximately 20% of individual differences in Grade Point Average (GPA) and Material35\nHardship (out-of-sample). For non-cognitive traits such as ‘grit’, the accuracy was as low as 5%.36\nHowever, there are methodological developments that promise improvements in predictions too. The37\nrevolution in natural language processing (NLP) using deep learning techniques – such as transformer-38\nbased language models (Vaswani et al., 2017) – has sparked an extraordinary advancement in the way39\nmachines can interact with humans and generate human-like language (Brown et al., 2020). These40\ndevelopments have not only led to the widespread adoption of NLP in a variety of real-world applications,41\nincluding ‘chatbots’, virtual assistants, and automated customer service systems (Dale, 2021), but have42\nalso opened up a vast array of new research opportunities. Attention is gradually turning towards more43\ngeneralisable problems with frontier technologies (such as the ‘predictability hypotheses’ as outlined by44\nvan Loon, 2023), such as analysing dense data on life-events within vector spaces which represent human45\nlife courses. In some domains, epistemic error is being rapidly eliminated in a way which reduces total46\npredictive error to its purely aleatoric component (for a generalised framework, see Yan and Rahal, 2024).47\nIt has, for example, been shown that it is feasible to operationalise life courses through a comprehensive48\nregistrar of individual, micro-level data which are readable as language and are amenable to NLP-49\nbased predictions (Savcisens et al., 2023). Here, we explore the extent to which NLP can help to50\npredict a key part of the educational and psycho-social life course based on alternative, non-standard51\ndata sources. We exploit information from aspirational essays written by children at the formative age52\nof eleven, and we compare predictions made from them with state-of-the-art genomic techniques and53\nteacher assessments. With this non-standard data, we are able to contrast our accurate predictions with54\nstudies such as Salganik et al. (2020) and Lundberg et al. (2024), which claim that human lives are55\nessentially ‘unpredictable’. This is made possible by a unique birth cohort based study which allows56\nsuch an expansive research design.57\nPrevious text-based attempts have achieved only limited success in predicting, for example, person-58\nality, mental health, cognitive ability, and educational achievement, with variance explanations ranging59\nfrom 5-10% (Abramov and Yampolskiy, 2019; C¨ oltekin, 2020; Fast and Funder, 2008; Rodriguez et al.,60\n2010). However – in an approach not dissimilar to Jones (2013a) – Alvero et al. (2021) recently demon-61\nstrated the potential of essay content and style in predicting authors’ outcomes. Using 240,000 admission62\nessays submitted by 60,000 applicants to the University of California, they applied Linguistic Inquiry63\nand Word Count (LIWC) as well as Correlated Topic Modeling (CTM) to ∼1,400 words per respondent,64\nresulting in benchmarks of up to 49% variance explained in a composite SAT score and 16% for house-65\nhold income. Such findings suggest that prediction might be possible based on information hidden in66\nalternative data sources in comparison to standard classical survey data.67\nThe sample used in Alvero et al. (2021) was highly selective and homogenous, comprising only68\npotential college students, which restricts generalizability. SAT scores and household income represent a69\nspecific yet limited set of traits that may be highly correlated with textual data. Such findings strongly70\nmotivate further research on the potential of text-based prediction,in order to define both the reducible71\nand irreducible ‘origins of unpredictability’ (Lundberg et al., 2024). We aim to identify how accurate72\nthese computationally advanced text-based predictions are for a wider range of psycho-social outcomes73\n– educational attainment and cognitive traits and non-cognitive traits – utilizing recent advances in74\nnatural language processing techniques (e.g. Brown et al., 2020). Our research design allows us to surpass75\npreviously understood accuracy as reached in the existing literature. It does this by utilizing state-of-the-76\nart algorithms and computational approaches resulting in combining more than 500 lexicographic metrics77\nused in computational linguistics with high-dimensional, deep-learning-based numerical representations78\nof each text sample. Importantly, our analyses focus on small text samples of around∼250 words only. To79\nmaximize predictive accuracy, we use these extracted features as input to an array of established machine80\n2\nIn-sample MeanRandom F or est Suppor t V ect or \nMachine\nShallo w Neur al \nNet\nCognitiv e Ability\n(A ges 11 and 33)\nData and Pr ocessing Model Building Pr edictions\n250 W or d Essa ys\nwritt en at age 11\n500 Le xicogr aphic metrics wit h \n1536-dim w or d embeddings\n22 T eacher A ssessment s\nof student s age 11\n35m+ genetic\npolymorphisms\n Linear Model Extr eme Gr adient \nBoosting\n33 poly genic scor es r elat ed\nt o pscyhological,  ph ysical,\nand social tr ait s\n0 001 0 0 0 0 00\n0 000 01\n0 010 00\n0000 000 00\n0 0 00\n1\n0 000 10 0 0 00\nSuper Learner\n(10-f old CV) \nEducational A ttainmen t\n(A ge 33)\nNoncognitiv e T r ait s\n(A ges 11 and 33)\nL A SS O\n\nPr e-scr eening\nPr edictions\nFigure 1: Overview of the research design. PGSs, essays and teacher assessments are used to construct\ncovariates as input to an ensemble algorithm (SuperLearner) which predicts cognitive ability, noncognitive\ntraits and educational attainment.\nlearning algorithms within an ensemble SuperLearner framework (Polley and Van Der Laan, 2010; Van81\nder Laan et al., 2007). Through extensive, repeated algorithic training and testing in subsamples of our82\ndata via the process of cross-validation, we arrive at a substantial predictive accuracy on held-out test83\ndata while also protecting against over-fitting.84\nWe examine predictions across various outcomes and time spans, from contemporaneous outcomes85\nsuch as cognitive abilities at age 11 – when the text samples are collected – to those decades later such as86\neducational attainment of the children at age 33. We are motivated to study educational attainment as87\nthis can be considered the central stratum in the contemporary world (Becker, 1964; Blau and Duncan,88\n1967) and is highly consequential for multiple channels of life course trajectories (Clark and Royer,89\n2013; Filippova et al., 2019; Zajacova and Lawrence, 2018). However, the causal effect of educational90\nattainment on individuals’ life courses has also been challenged, highlighting the possibility that it is91\nmainly a proxy for effects of educational precursors such as cognitive ability and non-cognitive traits92\n(Caplan, 2019). Therefore, we include these psychological life course predictors in our study. We contrast93\nand combine our text-based prediction with teacher assessments of students and state-of-the-art genomic94\nprediction of multiple polygenic scores (see Section 4). Teacher assessments represent the most common95\nalternative to academic tracking for career prediction (Baeriswyl et al., 2011) and show moderate to high96\ncorrelations with traits such as academic achievement (r = 0.65) and cognitive ability (r = 0.5, Urhahne97\nand Wijnia, 2021). These are the current limits to predictive accuracy given our existent understanding98\nof the literature. Investigating the accuracy of prediction with these outcomes is, in general, of great99\ninterest to recent meta-theoretical considerations. The comparison and combination of human judgment100\nand machine-based predictions has gained substantial interest not only for macro-economic or political101\ntrends, but primarily for individual outcomes such as health diagnostics (Zellner et al., 2021), despite only102\noccasional use in the social sciences (Filippova et al., 2019). Note that in our comparisons, we also rebuilt103\nthe predictive sociological model from the FFC in an analogy between GPA and educational attainment,104\nnearly perfectly replicating their results in our data despite the slight measurement difference.105\nThere are also longstanding questions regarding the role of genetics and the (social) environment,106\nwhich can be answered by considering the interplay of information generated at differential parts of an107\nindividual’s life (Dick, 2011). Our work speaks to the ‘gloomy prospective’ of Plomin and others (Plomin108\nand Daniels, 1987) where it is claimed that only genetic variation (and its phenotypical proxies) are useful109\nfor prediction (Plomin, 2011) and – controversially – should be used as information for college admission110\n(Plomin, 2018). We believe that we are the first to engage in a direct comparison of state-of-the-art111\ngenetic prediction – common in science and society (Hart, 2016; Morris et al., 2020; Plomin, 2018) – with112\nteacher assessment and essay-based predictions. The ‘gloomy prospect’ of unpredictability exemplifies a113\nmeta-theoretical framework that hypothesizes the complexity-driven unpredictability of historical events,114\ntestable through prediction algorithms rather than traditional inferential methods (Risi et al., 2019; van115\nLoon, 2023).116\n3\nThe National Child Development Study (NCDS, Power and Elliott, 2006) provides us with a unique117\nopportunity, allowing us to compare cutting edge approaches to prediction in a comparative setting. This118\nBritish birth cohort data collection – which started in 1958 – is still ongoing. It requested participants119\nat age eleven to write an essay of roughly 250-word length under the theme of “Imagine you are 25”120\n(see Section 4.1.1). At the same age, teachers of the respondents were asked to assess their students’121\ngeneral knowledge, number work, use of books, and oral ability – all on a scale from one to five – as well122\nas certain behaviors and motor abilities on a scale from one to three (see Section 4.1.2). Eventually, in123\n2002, blood samples of participants were collected and later genotyped (see Section 4.1.3). Importantly124\nfor our research design and the practical goals of behavioral and life course prediction more broadly –125\ne.g. intervention (Hart, 2016) – our measures are time-invariant early-life course predictors, with the126\ngenome fixed at conception.127\nSimilar to our text-based analysis, genomics confronts us with the challenge of large, seldom unstruc-128\ntured data. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) link molecular genetic variations to psychological129\nand social outcomes (Lee et al., 2018) and allow out-of-sample prediction from genotyped data based130\non individual genetic summary scores (Selzam et al., 2017; von Stumm et al., 2020). We follow this131\napproach to reduce the complexity of 35 million genetic markers by applying standard quality control132\nand merging with publicly available summary statistics from highly powered GWAS. We apply a multi-133\npolygenic score (PGS) approach to trait prediction (see Section 4) leveraging a set of 33 traits which134\ntheory would suggest are associated with our outcomes of interest (Krapohl et al., 2018). Our overall135\nresearch design is schematically displayed in Figure 1, where we also additionally highlight the temporal136\nelement to our predictions.137\n2 Results138\n2.1 Essays, Teacher Assessments and Genetic Markers Predict Cognitive139\nand Non-Cognitive Traits140\nWe denote predictive power using R2\nHoldout scores, where 0 equals the performance of a prediction based141\non the training-sample mean, and 1 is a perfect prediction, roughly comparable to the well-known and142\nmore traditional in-sample R2; see Section 4, Material and Methods for details regarding our approach143\nand our supplementary material for full details. With this metric, the performance of natural language144\nprocessing (NLP) based information sets from essays for cognitive abilities and non-cognitive traits is145\nsubstantial, and approaches or exceeds teacher assessments (TA, see Figure 2). Predictions are strongest146\nfor reading (at age 11, NLP = 0.59; TA = 0.57; at age 16 NLP = 0.58; TA = 0.56), verbal (0.55; 0.57),147\nmathematical (at age 11, 0.55; 0.57; at age 16, 0.55; 0.62) abilities and smaller for non-verbal ability148\n(0.37; 0.45). Genetic predictions are substantially smaller, with 0.14, 0.15, 0.13, 0.16, 0.17, and 0.11 for149\nreading, verbal, mathematical, and non-verbal ability. The prediction for non-cognitive traits is much150\nless precise in general. For occupational aspiration, essays have of R2\nHoldout of, TA 0.11, and PGSs of 0.04.151\nThe pattern is similar for scholastic motivation (0.08; 0.09; 0.05) whilst externalizing shows a moderate152\nprediction based on TA (0.08; 0.19; 0.04) and internalizing behavior is least predictable (0.03, 0.08, and153\n0.01). Additionally, we found that our models could predict ‘Big 5’ personality traits measured at age154\n50, with essays predicting over 10% of the variance in agreeableness and openness (see Supplementary155\nSection C.2 and Supplementary Figure D.10). 1156\n2.2 Embeddings drive Performance of Textual Prediction157\nWe aim to understand the efficacy of our textual prediction model by decomposing our SuperLearner(s)158\ninto a series of discrete submodels. These submodels consisted of: a) Traditional readability metrics, b)159\nOrthographic and grammatical error ratios, c) Advanced computational linguistic measures, including160\n1As outlined in Section 4, we used L1 regularization to pre-screen variables in each fold of the SuperLearner. We examined\nthe consistency of feature selection across all folds and outcome variables for each of the three basic SuperLearner models.\nFor the genetic model, all polygenic scores were selected at least once, with household income, educational attainment, and\nage at first birth being the most consistently selected. In the teacher evaluation model, all covariates were also selected at\nleast once, with general knowledge, number work, and oral ability assessments being selected in every instance. For the\nessay-based model, while 149 features were never selected, the top 100 most consistently selected features were dominated\nby embedding dimensions (87) derived from the large language model. Only two non-embedding features from the essays\nare found among the top 10 most consistently selected: The root type-token ratio and the measure of textual lexical\ndiversity (MTLD), with the former being selected in 96.6% of all models.\n4\n0.55\n0.37\n0.59\n0.55\n0.58\n0.4\n0.13\n0.11\n0.14\n0.16\n0.15\n0.17\n0.57\n0.45\n0.57\n0.62\n0.56\n0.5\n0.11\n0.08\n0.08\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.04\n0.01\n0.11\n0.09\n0.19\n0.08\nNon−cognitive Traits\nCognitive Abilities\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6\nNonverbal\nAbility (Age 11)\nMathematical\nAbility (Age 16)\nMathematical\nAbility (Age 11)\nVerbal Ability\n(Age 11)\nReading Ability\n(Age 16)\nReading Ability\n(Age 11)\nInternalizing\nBehavior (Age 16)\nScholastic\nMotivation (Age 16)\nExternalizing\nBehavior (Age 16)\nOccupational\nAspirations (Age 11)\nR H oldout\n2\n~250 Word Essay Combination of PGS Teacher Evaluations\nFigure 2:10-Fold Cross-Validated predictive R2\nHoldout from SuperLearner-models based on essays, teacher\nassessments and genomic data for various cognitive abilities and non-cognitive traits.

The additional incorporation of PGSs improves the prediction for175\nboth TA and DL only minimally. When all three approaches are combined into an ensemble model,176\nthe mean accuracy across folds increases to 0.70, demonstrating the benefit of using multiple sources of177\ninformation. For educational attainment, TA shows the highest mean accuracy (0.29), followed by NLP178\n(0.26) and PGS (0.19). Combining TA and the NLP prediction only marginally improves the TA by179\n0.07, but additional information from the teacher improves the NLP based results even further. PGSs180\nprediction adds substantially to TA (0.24) and DL prediction (0.28). Incrementally, in comparison to181\nthe two other approaches, each of TA (0.19), NLP (0.06) and PGSs (0.23) add predictive power through182\ntheir own unique information content.183\n2We also calculated R 2 metrics for simple models which contain only the first ten genetic Principal Components.

That analysis also includes birth weight and188\nheight as two popular biological predictors of education for comparison. However, those measures only189\npredict attained education by accuracies of 0.01 and 0.03 respectively. To put the performance of our190\nmodels into context, one of the most heralded sociological predictors of educational attainment – parental191\neducation – is only able predict with an accuracy of 0.12. Importantly, we rebuild an extended version192\nof the sociological model from the FFC to predict educational attainment – in parallel to their outcome193\nmeasure of GPA – based on the child’s sex at birth, father’s education level, mother’s education level,194\nsocial class of the mother’s husband, household living density (persons per room), father’s socioeconomic195\nclassification and social class of the mother’s father. These results from our more sociological model act196\nas a vaguely proximal replication of that earlier work, with an R 2\nHoldout of 0.18 in a generealised linear197\nframework (0.19 with a SuperLearner).198\n7\n0.35\n0.26\n0.01\n0.03\n0.18\n0.38\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nBirthweight Height Sociological\nBaseline\nModel\nNon−cognitive\nTraits\nCognitive\nAbilities\nPolygenic Scores,\n~250 Word Essay &\nTeacher Evaluation\nR H oldout\n2\nFigure 5:A model containing all three information sets (TA, NLP, PGSs) estimated with a SuperLearner-\nbased approach is compared to generalised linear models based on cognitive ability factor, non-cognitive\ntraits, parental education, birth weight and height.

Error bars mark the lowest and highest R 2\nHoldout over\nall folds, where the height of the bars represent the mean R 2\nHoldout.\n3 Discussion199\nWe utilise recent and substantial developments in NLP to re-estimate how accurate social and psycho-200\nsocial prediction can be based on the extent to which small amounts of text can predict the cognitive201\nskills, non-cognitive traits, and educational attainment of individuals. Our study shows – in contrast202\nto previous claims (Plomin and Daniels, 1987; Salganik et al., 2020; Turkheimer, 2000) – that moderate203\nto highly accurate predictions of such outcomes are possible. Predictions for educational attainment204\nnearly double the predictive accuracy seen in the more temporally proximal measured Grade Point205\nAverage or Material Hardship of the FFC. Our text-based predictions reach an accuracy of 0.56 based206\non a substantially shorter essay ( ∼250 words) and in a smaller, yet much more representative sample207\nthan the most closely related existing research which leverages textual data (Alvero et al., 2021). The208\nprediction of our best model approaches test-retest reliability of benchmark intelligence tests (Canivez209\nand Watkins, 1998). While our predictions for non-cognitive traits still exceed the benchmark predictions210\nfor ‘grit’ in the FFC, these traits appear to be less easily predicted than cognition and education based on211\nour data and methodology. The FFC provided participants with information on both test scores and a212\nteacher survey; one of our main predictors. Heterogeneity in prediction success can therefore have other213\nsources, too, such as sample selection, the exact intricacies of the measurement of outcomes of interest,214\nand the homogeneity of participants natural to the birth cohort study which we use in contrast to other215\ndata sources.216\nAccurate predictions of psychological and social outcomes are highly relevant to various current217\ndebates. While survey data might be limited in its ability to provide precise predictions, and our218\nstudy shows the opportunities available from alternative data, and in the process identifies space for219\npositive intervention. Our approach offers a fresh perspective on this ‘gloomy prospect’ (Lundberg220\net al., 2024; Plomin and Daniels, 1987) of unpredictablity. Additionally, the juxtaposition of “man”221\nagainst “machine” has a long tradition (Jones, 2013b), and we show how progress in the field produces222\nreasonable essay assessments as a function of NLP algorythms (Feigenbaum and Gross, 2020). In this223\nsense, AI-based automation of teaching tasks is a potential challenge in current debates on technology224\nand education (Selwyn, 2021), with growing interest dedicated to the task of automating essay scoring225\n(Foltz et al., 2020). Will algorithms such as those developed within this paper one day replace the role226\nof teachers’ assessments, or help to re-frame the debate around alternative sources of admissions data?227\nWe show that – based on the current state-of-the-art technologies – teachers’ assessments still provide228\nstrong predictive accuracy, and we subsequently stress the importance of expert opinion at a time when229\n8\nsome look to automation. However, given that textual samples were able to provide an almost equivalent230\npredictive power to the teacher-evaluation-based predictions, there is clear evidence that machines can231\nsupport teacher’s work in schools too, with further methodological development surely forthcoming in232\nthis area.233\nIn the past, textual data has been of rather limited utility to quantitative and computational re-234\nsearchers. While our approach presents an example of how information encoded within complex data235\nresources can be realised to create societal value, it also puts into perspective the use of prediction based236\non genetics for collegiate admissions (Plomin, 2018) in comparison to other sources of complex informa-237\ntion, although we acknowledge the potential to further improve in the future in conjunction with ever238\nmore powerful genetic discoveries (Wainschtein et al., 2022). It must also be emphasized that our results239\nshould be contextualised within a specific place, space and time. We also note the cost – in terms of240\nboth data collection and computational processing – of working with textual and genomic data. For that241\nreason, in limited resource settings, we show and emphasize here the value that remains in the use of242\nteacher assessments; they perform well, and are otherwise relatively inexpensive to collect and process.243\nAs alluded to in Section 1, this work is only possible because of the design of one specific and unique244\ndataset, which by definition prohibits exploration of external validity. While showing substantial promise245\nwith respect to its predictive performance and a clear need for the increased collection of non-standard246\ndata such as this (the expense of doing so not withstanding), our work also raises important ethical247\nquestions, as it will almost certainly be the case that predictive accuracy continues to increase across248\nand be integrated into all aspects of society. Confidence in applied predictive systems has led to mistakes249\nin the past, not least in the fields of recidivism (Chouldechova, 2017) and credit default (Fuster et al.,250\n2022). Bias in educational testing also has a storied history, anticipating many aspects of the modern251\nalgorithmic bias and fairness literature (Baker and Hawn, 2021), and is none more important than within252\nthe era of large language models. As digital measures are slowly emerging, identifying the appropriate253\nregulation of increasingly accurate applications of (social and behavioural) prediction remains a key254\nconsideration for further ethical research.255\n3.1 Limitations256\nAlthough we demonstrate the predictability of psycho-social outcomes, our study is not withouth limi-257\ntations. First, it is unclear to what extent our results are generalizable as they are based on a particular258\nsample of individuals born in the year 1958 in Great Britain, and their educational biographies might259\nnot be comparable to that of today’s contemporary pupils within or outside of the UK. This underscores260\nthe need for more longitudinal datasets which combine different and diverse types of non-standard data261\nwith classical social surveys and behavioral assessments. In our supplementary information (Section C),262\nwe address potential concerns related to variations in sample composition due to different non-response263\npatterns across different variables. Specifically, we reran our primary analyses on a subset of 1,618 indi-264\nviduals with full information across all key variables. Although predictive performance showed increased265\nvariation in this reduced sample, our findings remained robust. Despite these robustness checks, we266\nacknowledge the potential influence of systematic missingness – especially in the genetic subsample – on267\nour results.268\nSecond, prediction alone is not sufficient to understand the factors that drive the association be-269\ntween non-standard data sources and outcomes, and future research should investigate the mechanisms270\nconnecting the information in the essays with the successful prediction of the outcomes.271\nFinally, we have not data mined the three sources of information as thoroughly as we might have272\ndone, or utilised more emergent GPT models. An example of this is the fact that we created PGS273\nusing Clumping and Thresholding with a prespecified p-value threshold of 0.5 and we want to make our274\napplications as standardised as possible; custom thresholds per trait would likely increase the predictive275\naccuracy of our models even further. The same holds for more sophisticated Bayesian methods of PGS276\nconstruction that leverage functional information about the genome (Zheng et al., 2024), which may277\nfurther increase predictive performance, though likely not qualitatively change results. Similarly – and278\nwhile we found no discernible difference between the models which we employed – Large Language Models279\nare currently evolving rapidly, and analysis done on closed models is subject to change at the behest of280\nthose who release their trained models. See Section 4 for additional information on the variations we281\nhave explored in general.282\n9\n4 Methods283\n4.1 Data284\nThe dataset used for our analyses is the National Child Development Study (NCDS), an ongoing British285\nbirth cohort study starting with 17,415 children born in a single week of 1958. We seek to evaluate the286\nextent to which genomic data, teacher assessments, and the information embedded in the essays are able287\nto predict outcome variables that can be broadly categorized under three different themes: cognitive288\nabilities, non-cognitive traits, and socioeconomic outcomes, most of which are directly taken from the289\nNCDS data or created using factor analysis. We briefly describe the construction of all variables involved290\nand refer to the Supplementary Information for a detailed discussion.291\n4.1.1 Essays292\nAt age eleven, study participants were asked to write an essay under the theme “Imagine you are 25”. In293\ntotal 10,511 essays of varying lengths (ranging from 1 to 1239 words) were transcribed. We apply various294\napproaches to extract the maximum amount of information from them. First, by using a pre-trained and295\nstate-of-the-art deep-learning NLP model – text-embedding-ada-002 – to extract representations of296\nthe words of all essays in lower dimensional space. These embeddings capture the semantic importance297\nof each word in context and allow the expression of the texts by numeric vectors along 1,536 dimensions.298\nIn addition, we measure 535 linguistic metrics of lexical diversity (TAALED, Kyle et al., 2021), lexical299\nsophistication (TAALES, Kyle et al., 2018) and sentiment (SEANCE, Crossley et al., 2017), 31 metrics of300\nreadability, and grammatical and typographical error/word-ratios. Additional details on the construction301\nof these features is provided in Supplementary Information Section A.1.302\n4.1.2 Teacher Evaluations303\nWe use 22 teacher-related variables overall. At age eleven, teachers of the respondents were asked to304\nassess their students’ general knowledge, number work, use of books, oral ability on a scale from one to305\nfive, as well as certain behaviors and motor abilities on a scale from one to three. In addition, a series of306\nbehavioral descriptions were given to a teacher who is asked to underline the descriptions which best fit307\nthe child. By summing the number of selected items, a quantitative assessment of the child’s adjustment308\nto school is obtained for multiple categories of behavior. Additional details on the construction of these309\nfeatures are provided in Supplementary Information Section A.2.310\n4.1.3 Genomic Data311\nWe utilize genotyped data from multiple subsets of NCDS participants. We combine all available genomic312\ndata into a single file and restricted the available single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to those in313\ncommon with the reference panel of the 1000 Genomes Project. The final sample contains 37,772,588314\nvariants across 6,437 individuals. Using PRSice2 (Choi and O’Reilly, 2019), we then utilized publicly315\navailable summary statistics of genome-wide association studies to construct polygenic scores for a set of316\n33 curated traits (listed in Table E.1) 3. These summary statistics span the realms of cognition, mental317\nhealth, personality, physical composure, social behavior, and substance abuse. Additional details on the318\nconstruction of these features are provided in Supplementary Information Section A.3. All polygenic319\nscores were jointly used as input to the SuperLearner (see below), akin to a multi-polygenic score model320\n(Krapohl et al., 2018). Given our focus on predictive power rather than causal inference, we did not321\ncorrect for population stratification, as doing so could potentially reduce the predictive utility of the322\npolygenic scores in our specific population. This follows the argument outlined by Plomin and Von Stumm323\n(2022), which considers population stratification as a valid source of genetic variance for polygenic score324\nprediction within a defined population.325\n4.2 Analytical Strategy326\nWe run the SuperLearner with nested cross-validation, using 5-folds in the inner and 10 in the outer327\nloop. We utilise the Mean Squared Error as the cost function using the SuperLearner package in R. No328\n3As an exploratory robustness check, the extensive set of polygenic scores provided by the Polygenic Index Repository\nBecker et al. (2021) constructed using LDPred (Priv´ e et al., 2020) was also tested in preliminary analyses as a comparision,\nleading to qualitatively similar results, see Figure D.1. In all but one example (Internalizing Behavior at Age 16), the\nPGI-Repository scores generated less accurate predictions.\n10\npreregistration of our analysis took place.329\n4.2.1 Metrics used330\nAs detailed in our supplementary appendix, we employed several approaches to extract information from331\nthe essays:332\n• GPT-based embeddings using thetext-embedding-ada-002 model resulting in a 1,536-dimensional333\nvector for each essay.334\n• SALAT-metrics, providing 534 measures related to various linguistic aspects.335\n• Readability-metrics, consisting of 31 different measures from the koRpus-package.336\n• Grammatical and typographical error ratios, derived using the LanguageTool CLI.337\nDespite the fact that the main aspects of our analysis were conducted using GPT-3.5, we also compare338\nour results to RoBERTa and GPT 4.0 embeddings. The results – shown in Figure D.2 – are largely339\ninvariant across the GPT 3.5 and 4.0 embeddings, but both offer predictive gains above the RoBERTa340\nembeddings.341\n4.2.2 Size of predictive models342\nOur main predictive model – as shown in Figure 2 – incorporates all above different types of text-based343\nfeatures in the SuperLearner framework. The model is large and comprehensive, and as detailed above,344\nuses four key types of extracted information. In Figure 4, we demonstrate the incremental utility of each345\nindividual information set in comparison to other commonly utilised – and simpler – alternatives.346\n4.2.3 SuperLearner347\nTo reduce learning error as much as is reasonably possible with input data from across from the three in-348\nformation sources (teacher assessments, essays, genomic data), we utilise a SuperLearner-based approach349\n(Polley and Van Der Laan, 2010; Van der Laan et al., 2007). SuperLearners are ensemble algorithms350\nthat estimate the performance of a selection of machine learning models based on cross-validation. The351\nSuperLearner algorithm combines predictions from multiple individual machine learning models, such as352\nExtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, all in order to generate a fi-353\nnal prediction. This is done through a process called ‘stacking’ or ‘model averaging’. We used the default354\nsettings provided by the SuperLearner package in R for each algorithm, without performing additional355\nalgorithm-specific hyper-parameter tuning. This approach focused on the overall ensemble performance356\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency and reducing overfitting risks. As a large number of vari-357\nables are extracted from the essays in the form of word embeddings and beyond, LASSO regressions358\n(implemented in glmnet) are used as a pre-screening algorithm. LASSO pre-processing was performed359\nonce per outcome per fold in the cross-validation process. We use a diverse range of state-of-the-art360\nmachine-learning models as inputs to the SuperLearner: Extreme Gradient Boosting, as implemented in361\nthe package xgboost (Chen et al., 2015), RandomForest, as implemented in the package ranger (Wright362\nand Ziegler, 2015), a shallow neural network as implemented in the package nnet, SVM with a Radial363\nBasis Kernel as implemented in the package ksvm, a simple linear regression model in base R, and the364\nmean of the outcome in the training set. From these estimates, the SuperLearner determines an optimal365\nweighted average prediction based on the performance of individual composite models. The weights366\nattributed to each of these individual models can be seen in Figure D.3, which indicates that it is the367\nLinear Model and the Random Forest which receive the highest weightings across almost all outcomes.368\n4.2.4 Cross-validation369\nFor each outcome variable in each fold, a separate LASSO model was fit to select relevant features. We370\nused 10-fold cross-validation for all three of our types of models (textual data, genomic data, and teacher371\nassessments). However – as we document in detail in the supplementary material – the performance372\nof a linear model was comparable for genomic data and teacher assessments. The textual data, on the373\nother hand, benefited significantly from the SuperLearner approach, which is why we emphasize the374\ncross-validated results for this model. The number of features retained varied depending on the outcome375\nvariable and specific fold.376\n11\n4.2.5 Metric assessment377\nWe use the R2\nHoldout metric, also known as the ‘predictive R 2’, as our primary evaluation criterion. This378\nchoice aligns with recent related studies in the literature (Salganik et al., 2020). The R 2\nHoldout can be379\nconsidered a predictive counterpart to the well-known coefficient of determination (R 2). This metric380\nassesses a model’s predictive performance by comparing its predictions on holdout data to a baseline381\nprediction using only the mean of the training set. Specifically, for each cross-validation fold, we calculate:382\nR2\nHoldout = 1 −\nP\ni∈Holdout(yi − ˆyi)2\nP\ni∈Holdout(yi − ¯yTraining)2\nwhere yi is the actual value for observation i in the holdout set ˆyi is the predicted value for observation383\ni ¯yTraining is the mean of the target variable in the training set. The interpretation of R 2\nHoldout – while384\nsimilar in some respects to the standard in-sample R 2 – has important differences. A value of 1 still385\nindicates perfect prediction. A value of 0 suggests the model’s predictions on the holdout set are no386\nbetter than simply using the training set mean (or prevalence in the case of binary dependent variables).387\nNegative values are possible in contrast to standard R 2, indicating that the model’s predictions on new388\ndata are worse than using the training set mean. Unlike the standard R 2 – which is always between 0389\nand 1 for models with an intercept – the R 2\nHoldout can take on any value less than or equal to 1 (i.e., be390\ninfinitely negative in the case of infinitely inaccurate predictions). This reflects its nature as a measure of391\nout-of-sample predictive performance, rather than in-sample fit. The R 2\nHoldout provides a more realistic392\nassessment of a model’s predictive capability on new, unseen data, making it particularly useful for393\nevaluating and comparing predictive models. 4394\n4It’s worth noting that our implementation – which uses cross-validation – technically results in what Bates et al. (2023)\nrefer to as R 2\nCV. While R 2\nHoldout and R2\nCV are conceptually similar in that they both assess out-of-sample performance,\nthey have slightly different estimands. R 2\nCV provides an estimate of expected performance on a new sample from the\nsame population, while R 2\nHoldout estimates performance on a specific held-out dataset. While we use the term R 2\nHoldout\nthroughout this paper for consistency with previous literature in our field, we take this chance to acknowledge the technical\ndistinction between R2\nHoldout and R2\nCV here.\n12\nReferences395\nAbramov, P.

The566\ntheme of the essay was set as “Imagine you are 25”. The exact set of instructions given were as follows:567\n“Imagine you are now 25 years old. Write about the life you are leading, your interests, your568\nhome life and your work at the age of 25. You have 30 minutes to do this.”569\nIn total, 10,511 essays of varying length – ranging from 1 to 1,239 words – were transcribed. See Figure570\nD.4 for a visualisation of the distribution of essay lengths. We apply various approaches which extract571\nthe maximal amount of information from these essays:572\n• GPT-based embeddings: We utilize the text-embedding-ada-002 model, a pre-trained and573\nstate-of-the-art deep learning natural language processing (NLP) model provided via the OpenAI-574\nPlatform API, to generate vector representations of the words in all essays. This model converts575\neach essay into a 1,536-dimensional numeric vector, capturing the semantic meaning of words in576\ntheir context. These embeddings provide a lower-dimensional representation of the text that pre-577\nserves important semantic information, allowing for efficient computational analysis of the essays’578\ncontent using our SuperLearner pipeline.579\n• SALAT-metrics: The Suite of Automatic Linguistic Analysis Tools (SALAT) is a set of open-580\nsource linguistic programs. We use it to derive 814 measures related to lexical sophistication, text581\ncohesion, syntactic complexity, lexical diversity, grammar and sentiment for each essay. Keeping582\nonly those metrics that are available for all texts, we end up with 534 measures in total.583\n• Readability-metrics: Readability metrics measure the ease with which a reader can understand584\na written text based on its number of words, sentences, characters, and syllables. The koRpus-585\npackage provides a set of 31 of such metrics (ARI, Bormuth, Coleman, Coleman.Liau, Dale.Chall,586\nDanielson.Bryan, Dickes.Steiwer, DRP, ELF, Farr.Jenkins.Paterson, Flesch, Flesch.Kincaid, FOG,587\nFORCAST, Fucks, Gutierrez, Harris.Jacobson, Linsear.Write, LIX, nWS, RIX, SMOG, Spache,588\nStrain, Traenkle.Bailer, TRI, Tuldava, Wheeler.Smith), which are computed for every essay.589\n• Grammatical and typographical errors:The number of grammatical and typographical errors590\nin a text carries important information about the capabilities of the author which might be captured591\nneither by the embeddings nor the proposed metrics. We therefore use the LanguageTool CLI via592\nthe LanguageToolR-package to get a list of more than 184,000 errors in total over all essays which593\nwe group into distinct categories like grammar, misspelling, typographical, duplication, and style.594\nFor each category, we then calculate error/word-ratios that are used as input to the SuperLearner.595\nA.2 Teacher Assessments596\nAt age 11, teachers of the respondents were asked to assess their students:597\n“In so far as your professional experience will allow, please rate the child in relation to all598\nchildren of his age (i.e. not just his present class or even his school) by ringing the number599\nopposite the appropriate description (going from 1 - Exceptional to 5 - Very limited.)”600\nFor our purposes, four questions are particularly relevant and are used in the analysis:601\n• General knowledge602\n• Number work603\n• Use of books604\n• Oral ability605\nAs a testament to the teachers’ calibration, all four variables exhibit behavior akin to a normal distri-606\nbution, as can be seen in Figure D.5. We extend this selection by six additional items, this time less607\nfocused on the scholastic abilities of the child, but more on their behavior and motor abilities:608\n“Below are a few descriptions of behavior shown by some children. Any one particular de-609\nscription is likely to apply to only a minority of children; moreover, quite a proportion of610\nchildren may show at least in some degree one of the aspects of behavior listed below. If the611\ndescription fits the child, please circle the figure 1 in the first column. If it is a marginal case,612\nor you are in some doubt about the child’s inclusion under this description, please circle the613\nfigure 2 in the next column. If the description does not fit the child at all circle the figure 3614\nin the third column (going from 1 - Cert. applies to 3 - Not at all).”615\nThe list that was provided included the following behavioural descriptors:616\n• Has poor hand control617\n• Squirmy, fidgety618\n• Has poor physical co-ordination619\n• Hardly ever still620\n• Has speech difficulties621\n• Imperfect grasp of English622\nHowever, most children are judged to exhibit none of the behaviors in question, as shown in Figure D.6.623\nFinally, we utilize an additional set of behavior assessments at age 11 (Shepherd, 2013), in which a series624\nof behavioral descriptions is given. The teacher is asked to underline the descriptions which best fit the625\nchild. By summing the number of selected items, a quantitative assessment of the child’s adjustment to626\nschool is obtained for multiple categories.627\n• Inconsequential Behavior628\n• Nervous Symptoms629\n• Anxiety for Acceptance (Adults)630\n• Anxiety for Acceptance (Children)631\n• Hostility towards Children632\n• Writing off Adults/Adult Standards633\n• Hostility towards Adults634\n• Miscellaneous Symptoms635\n• Restlessness636\n• Unforthcomingness637\n• Depression638\n• Withdrawal639\nThe maximum score differs for each category. However, most participants received the lowest possible640\nassessment (Figure D.7).641\nA.3 Genomic data642\nGenetic data for the NCDS cohort were obtained from samples collected during the biomedical sweep643\nconducted between 2002 and 2004. Genotyping was performed on these samples in separate batches using644\nvarious genotyping chips, followed by independent imputation. The resulting genetic information was645\nthen integrated into a comprehensive genetic database, which includes data for 6,435 study participants.646\nA portion of the samples were genotyped as control cases in the WTCCC1, WTCCC2, and T1DGC647\nconsortia. Comprehensive details regarding the quality control (QC) and imputation procedures applied648\nto these samples can be found in the works of Soler Artigas et al. (2015) and Davies et al. (2015). In649\ncases where samples were genotyped on multiple chips, preference was given to those that underwent650\nimputation and QC by Soler Artigas et al. (2015). To maintain consistency, all samples were limited651\nto SNPs in common with the reference panel of the 1,000 Genomes Project. The final sample consisted652\nof 37,772,588 variants on 6,437 individuals. Using PRSice2 (Choi and O’Reilly, 2019), we then applied653\npublicly available summary statistics of GWAS to construct polygenic scores for a set of 33 curated654\ntraits likely to show associations with the outcomes in question, listed in Table E.1. Polygenic scores655\nwere calculated using a prespecified threshold of p = 0.5 in the sample and with the software default values656\nfor clumping (250kb window; r2 = .1). To assess the robustness of our genetic prediction results, we657\nconducted additional analyses using all polygenic scores made available by the Polygenic Index Repository658\n(Becker et al., 2021). The Repository PGIs were created using summary statistics from large-scale659\ngenome-wide association studies (GWAS), including data from UK Biobank and 23andMe. The PGIs660\nwere constructed using Plink2 with SNP weights adjusted for linkage disequilibrium (LD) using LDpred, a661\nmethod that has been shown to improve the predictive power of polygenic scores compared to traditional662\nmethods that do not account for LD. Results for a comparison of both sets of PGSs can be found in663\nFigure D.1. The results were largely consistent with our primary findings, Although scores from the664\nPGI-Repository provided slightly less accuracy.665\n18\nB Outcomes666\nWe seek to evaluate the extent to which genomic data, teacher assessments, and the information embed-667\nded in the essays are able to predict a range of outcome variables that can be broadly categorized under668\nthree different themes: Cognitive Ability, non-cognitive Traits and Socioeconomic Outcomes.669\nB.1 Cognitive Ability670\nAn array of tests conducted at age 11 is used to operationalize competencies such as:671\n• Verbal Ability,672\n• Nonverbal Ability,673\n• Reading Ability,674\n• Mathematical Ability.675\nThe associated variables are given in Table E.6. We used these variables to create a measure of general676\ncognitive ability by means of factor analysis. A 1-factor EFA was fitted using thepsych package (Revelle,677\n2017). All items show high loadings on a general ability factor and together explain more than 75% of678\nthe variance. We extract the factor scores from this model as our measure of general intelligence. In679\naddition, two tests of reading comprehension and mathematical ability at age 16 were used. A new680\nreading comprehension test consisted of 35 multiple-choice questions where the child must select the681\nappropriate word to complete a sentence, with scoring based on the number of correct answers. The682\nmathematics test included both numerical and geometric questions with a combination of 27 categorical683\nand four binary questions, scored in a similar manner.684\nB.2 Non-Cognitive Traits685\nScholastic Motivation: Scholastic motivation was measured by a battery of self-assessed items in686\nSweep 3 (age 16) using a five-point Likert-scale expressing agreement with the following statements. The687\nexact wording was:688\n“Below is a list of things that people of your age have said about how they feel towards school.689\nRead each one carefully and then ring one of the numbers to show for each one how true you690\nthink what it says is in your own case.”691\nThe associated variables are displayed in Table E.7. A one-factor solution once more fits the data well692\n(53.7% variance explained). Note that we use polychoric correlations as we are analyzing Likert-scale693\ndata.694\n695\nExternalizing Behavior: A wide range of items at age 16 taken from the Rutter scale was used to696\nconstruct measures of externalizing behavior (Table E.8). Each represents the answer on a scale from697\none (“Does not apply”) to three (“Certainly applies”) to the following prompt:698\n“Below is a series of descriptions of behavior often shown by school children. Please ring699\nthe appropriate number in each case to show the degree to which the study child exhibits700\nthe behavior described. Please complete on the basis of the child’s behavior in the past 12701\nmonths.”702\nAll items show high loadings on a single factor in an EFA with polychoric correlations whose results were703\nused to generate factor scores of externalizing behavior.704\n705\nInternalizing Behaviour: A further subset of items (Table E.9) collected at age 16 was used to706\nconstruct measures of internalizing behavior. Each one again represents the answer on a scale from one707\n(“Does not apply”) to three (“Certainly applies”) to the prompt:708\n“Below is a series of descriptions of behavior often shown by school children. Please ring709\nthe appropriate number in each case to show the degree to which the study child exhibits710\nthe behavior described. Please complete on the basis of the child’s behavior in the past 12711\nmonths.”712\n19\nAll items show high loadings on a single factor in an EFA with polychoric correlations whose results were713\nused to generate factor scores of internalizing behavior.714\n715\nOccupational Aspirations: At age 16, cohort members were asked about the first job they aspired716\nto have (variable name: n2771). The distribution is displayed in Figure D.8. These occupations were717\nmapped to the 1970 Classification of Occupations (variable name: co70) which was the current statistical718\nstandard in 1974 when the cohort members were interviewed. Using the mapping to co70 provided by719\nthe CAMSIS-project (Lambert and Prandy, 2023), a measure of occupational status was then assigned720\nto each occupation.5721\nB.3 Educational Attainment722\nA measure of the highest education obtained up to age 33 is available in Sweep 5 (variable name: hqual33)723\nas a six-level outcome, ranging from ‘No qualification’ to ‘Degree/higher NVQ 5,6’. It was treated as an724\nordinal variable in all analyses.725\n5Different occupations are mapped to different CAMSIS scores depending on whether the respondent is an employer,\nemployee, or self-employed. As this information was not available for the occupation in question, the score for employee\nwas used.\n20\nC Additional Analyses726\nC.1 Incremental Utility of SuperLearner over OLS727\nWe investigated to what extent the utility of the SuperLearner-based ensemble of machine learning728\nmethods used in this study exceeds standard OLS regressions. For this purpose, we ran 10-fold cross-729\nvalidated OLS regressions using our three sets of covariates (teacher assessments, essays, and genetic730\ndata) in order to predict cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. We then computed the difference in731\nR2\nHoldout to the respective SuperLearner model. The comparison is plotted in Figure D.9. We note732\nvirtually identical results for teacher assessments and genetic data, and substantial improvements for733\nthe essay-based predictors. For multiple non-cognitive outcomes, OLS-based prediction substantially734\nunder-performs a simple model using only the mean of the dependent variable in the training sample,735\nleading to negative R2\nHoldout values. In these cases, the difference to zero was calculated.736\nC.2 Predicting Personality at Age 50737\nTo extend the set of non-cognitive traits in our analysis, we also tested if essays, polygenic scores, and738\nteacher evaluations were able to predict dimensions of personality. Unfortunately, the earliest measure739\nof personality is available at age 50: The NCDS self-completion questionnaire in Sweep 8 contained740\n50 questions from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP, Goldberg et al., 2006), as shown in741\nTable E.10. The answers can be summed to obtain scores for the ‘Big-5’ personality traits: extraversion,742\nneuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness to experience. The scores for each trait743\nrange from 5 to 50, with higher scores corresponding to a higher expression of the respective trait. Even744\nthough our predictors are fixed at birth (genetic markers) or at age 11 (essays and teacher assessments)745\nand the outcome is measured substantially later in life (educational attainment at age 33), the mean746\npredictive R2 over all folds is greater than zero for all traits. This is highest for agreeableness and747\nopenness, where more than 10% of the variance can be explained by the essays (Figure D.10).748\nC.3 Robustness of Results Regarding Sample Composition749\nAs our analyses depend on variables with different patterns of nonresponse, we use all available observa-750\ntions in each of our models, leading to differences in sample composition that might influence results, as751\nshown in Table E.11. To show that sample composition does not affect our findings, we reran our anal-752\nysis on the subset of individuals with full information on every variable used in the main text, meaning753\ngenotyped respondents with available essays, teacher assessments, (non-)cognitive information, highest754\neducation at age 33, parental education, height at age 11, sex, and birthweight. This final set consisted755\nof only 1,618 individuals. Results are displayed in Figure D.11. In this case, variation in predictive per-756\nformance over all cross-validation folds is much larger compared to our complete-case models, a sensible757\nfinding as each fold consists of fewer observations (and ‘learning error’ might not be fully eliminated).758\nHowever, in all cases, the intervals denoting the range from worst to best prediction fold clearly overlap.759\nThe same holds true for our prediction of educational attainment, both for the stepwise prediction using760\ncombinations of teacher assessments, polygenic scores, and essays (Figure D.12), where the results of761\ndifferent folds clearly overlap.762\n21\nSupplemental References763\nBarban, N., R.
