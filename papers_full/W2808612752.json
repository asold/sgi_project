I NTRODUCTION\nHistorically, generation technology (such as Hydro and\nthermal based generation) has been centralized in nature,\nwith generation facilities being located away from the ac-\ntual consumers [1]–[3]. Currently, a growing portion of the\npower generation is located on distribution systems closer\nto customers. This includes PV , wind, fuel cells, combined\nheat and power systems and customer demand side resources\n(collectively known as Distributed Energy Resources-DERs).\nIntegrating these distributed resources with the planning and\noperation of the distribution system has become one of our\nmost important challenges.\nAs is the case with any new technology or idea, this advent\nof DERs has led to its own set of problems, some anticipated\nand some that were not. The integration of DERs (and as-\nsociated problems) is a subject of considerable discussion at\nthe moment with various CIGRE and IEEE working groups\nworking on this subject. Some of these issues have been\naddressed in IEEE standard 1547 [4] and the interested reader\nmay refer to the various parts of this standard for further\ndetails. This paper speciﬁcally focuses on Power Quality (PQ)\nissues associated with the interconnection and protection sys-\ntems associated with large PV installations. CIGRE working\ngroup C 4.29 has been discussing, analyzing and compiling\nsuch issues since 2013 and their report on the same [1] is\nan excellent reference for the interested reader. Utility expe-\nriences with such Power Quality issues have been compiled\nin [5], [6] and [7]. This paper reports two case studies on\nPQ problems caused by PV transformer energization that have\nbeen observed by industrial consumers located in the vicinity\nof solar PV installations. A third case study, was carried out\nin simulation, to understand the effect of resonance that gets\nexcited by PV transformer energization at the transmission\nlevel. This list of issues is not intended to be exhaustive. The\nrest of the paper is laid out as follows:\n• Section II: Layout of a typical PV installation\n• Section III: Case study 1: V oltage unbalance and reso-\nnance problems exacerbated by transformer energization.\n• Section IV: Case study 2: Zero crossing distortion caused\nby ringing during transformer energization.\n• Section V: Case study 3: Simulation analysis of resonance\nwith transmission cables that gets excited by PV trans-\nformer energization.\n• Section VI: Conclusions and scope for further work.\nII. S OLAR PV INSTALLATION\nSolar PV infrastructure can be installed at the consumer volt-\nage level (behind-the-metre systems) or at the sub-transmission\nor distribution voltage level (utility level systems). The layout\nof a typical utility level solar PV installation is shown in Fig.\n1\nFig. 1. Layout of a single stage of a typical grid-tied, utility level PV\ninstallation.\nGenerally, such installations have multiple inverters\n(connected to PV arrays), connected in cascade to the grid\nvia step-up transformers. Fig. 1 shows one ‘stage’ of PV\ngeneration. Generally, solar farms have multiple such ‘stages’.\n978-1-5386-0517-2/18/$31.00 c⃝ 2018 IEEE\nConsequently, instead of having one large transformer, solar\nfarms tend to have multiple smaller transformers, tied to\ninverters and PV arrays. These stages are then connected in\ncascade. The ﬁrst two case studies presented here are issues\nreported by utilities that were caused by the simultaneous\nenergization of these transformers. The third case study was\ndone in simulation to understand the effects of PV transformer\nexcited resonance issues on the transmission grid.\nIII. C ASE STUDY 1\nCase 1 was reported by a utility, where re-energization of\na solar farm following a disturbance caused industrial loads\nto trip elsewhere on the feeder. On the surface, the problem\nappeared to be a straightforward consequence of transformer\ninrush. Further investigation, however, revealed elevated levels\nof harmonic voltages, caused by a combination of transformer\nenergization, unbalance and resonance, to be the root cause.\nA single line diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 2.\nFig. 2. Single line diagram of system with location of solar farm and affected\nindustrial customer highlighted.\nThe solar farm was connected to the distribution grid using\ntwelve transformers (wye grounded-wye) with a power han-\ndling capacity of 1670 kVAeach. The distribution transformer\nhas a power capacity of 25 MVA(115 kV/23 kV) while the\nsystem has capacitors connected in the vicinity of both, the\nsolar farm and the industrial customer. V oltage and current\nwere measured on the low side of the distribution transformer,\nat the 23 kV bus. The industrial customer was supplied at\na voltage level of 12.5 kV that was then stepped down to\n4.16 kV. Twenty two transformers then stepped the voltage\ndown to 480 V. The control equipment in the industrial facility\nwas powered through a mix of 480/120 V, 480 Vto 24 VDC\nand 120 Vto 24 VDC transformations.\nA. Timeline of Events\nA fault downstream of the solar farm shown in Fig. 2\ncaused downstream load to trip. The fault then caused the\nundervoltage protection at the solar farm to trip ofﬂine. This\nis shown in Fig. 3 which shows a snapshot of current and\nvoltage measurements.This event shall be referred to as ‘event\n1’ in the rest of the relevant sections.\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\nTime (s)\n-50\n0\n50\nVoltage (kV)\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\nTime (s)\n-5000\n0\n5000\nCurrent (A)\nFig. 3. Three phase voltages (top) and currents (bottom) from ‘Ev ent 1’.\nFrom Fig. 3, it can be seen that the fault occurs at 0.01 s\nin the measurement window. The current temporarily goes up\nand the voltage gets depressed due to the high voltage drop\ncaused by the ﬂow of fault current through system impedance.\nAt about 0.36 s, protective devices operate and the solar farm\nas well as load downstream of it, trip ofﬂine. At 0.6 s, the\nfault is cleared and the load downstream of the solar farm\nis energized. A slight swell, from the pre-fault voltage is\nobserved in the measurement snapshot. However, neither the\nvoltage sag produced by the fault, nor the following swell\ncaused any load to trip elsewhere on the feeder.\nFollowing the energization of downstream load, the protec-\ntive equipment at the solar farm energized the transformers in\nthe farm exactly 3 minutes after downstream load energization.\nDuring this period, the inverters were kept ofﬂine i.e. the\nlow side of the transformer was kept open. The solar farm\ntransformer energization event is referred to as ‘event2’ in the\nrest of the relevant sections. V oltage and current waveforms for\nevent 2 are shown in Fig. 4. The voltage waveform for event\n2 shows a slight DC offset and a swell in magnitude based\nupon visual inspection. The current peak due to transformer\nenergization was observed to be 2000 A. More importantly,\nunlike event 1, event 2 caused equipment at the industrial\ncustomer to drop.\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\nTime (s)\n-50\n0\n50\nVoltage (kV)\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\nTime (s)\n-2000\n0\n2000\nCurrent (A)\nFig. 4. Three phase voltages (top) and currents (bottom) from ‘Ev ent 2’.\nThe time domain data of the two events is presented in\nFig. 3 and Fig. 4. However, besides giving an idea of the\ntwo incidents involved in the accidental tripping of industrial\nload, this data gives little detail or insight into the actual\ndifferences between the two events. In order to understand\nthese differences, a frequency domain snapshot of the two\nevents was created using Matlab’s ‘spectrogram’ functionality.\nB. Frequency domain analysis\nA spectrogram is a visual representation of frequency do-\nmain data, as it varies with time. In essence, a spectrogram\nis implemented as an intensity plot (using a logarithmic\nscale) of the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). In this\ncase, the signal was sampled at a speed of 128 samples per\ncycle (7.68 kHz). The phase A voltage from both events was\nanalyzed ﬁrst and has been shown in Fig. 5.\nEvent 1\n0.5 1 1.5\nTime (s)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500Frequency (Hz)\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\nPower/frequency (dB/Hz)\nEvent 2\n0.5 1 1.5\nTime (s)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500Frequency (Hz)\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\nPower/frequency (dB/Hz)\nFig. 5. Phase A voltage spectrogram for event 1 (left) and event 2 (right).\nThe voltage in both events contains second, third, fourth\nand ﬁfth harmonics as the dominant elements. The second har-\nmonic, characteristic of transformer energization, dampens out\nin < 1 s. However, the ﬁfth harmonic is dominant throughout\nthe measurement event and has the second highest magnitude\n(after the fundamental). The color of the harmonic frequency\nindicates its relative magnitude, with blue being the lowest and\nyellow being the highest magnitude. The voltage spectra, thus\ndemonstrate little difference between the two events in terms\nof frequency signature. However, this is not the case with the\ncurrent spectra, shown in Fig. 6.\nEvent 1\n0.5 1 1.5\nTime (s)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500Frequency (Hz)\n-50\n0\n50\nPower/frequency (dB/Hz)\nEvent 2\n0.5 1 1.5\nTime (s)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500Frequency (Hz)\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\nPower/frequency (dB/Hz)\nFig. 6. Phase A current spectrogram for event 1 (left) and event 2 (right).\nThe even harmonic current dampens out within 0.5 s in\nevent 2, indicating absence of sympathetic inrush current\nfrom the distribution transformer. In the case of event 1, the\nfundamental and third harmonic current are the dominant\nelements. However, in the case of event 2, the fundamental\nand ﬁfth harmonic elements dominate, with the third harmonic\nbeing present to a lesser extent. In order to have clarity on\nthe relative magnitude of the harmonic currents, FFT was\nperformed on the phase A current waveforms from event 1\nand event 2.\nThe instantaneous maximum amplitude for the ﬁfth har-\nmonic current was observed to be about 25% of the funda-\nmental current while that of the third harmonic current was\nabout 55% of fundamental. However, the FFT gives a ‘static’\nimage of the frequency. In other words, the FFT only indicates\nthe relative maximum amplitude of each frequency (even if\nthis maximum amplitude is momentary). What the FFT fails\nto show, unlike the Spectrogram, is that the ﬁfth harmonic is\npersistently present with a relatively large amplitude, through-\nout the measurement window. The system is simply unable to\ndampen out the magnitude of the ﬁfth harmonic current during\nthe 2 smeasurement window.\nThe dramatic jump in ﬁfth harmonic current magnitude\nbetween the two events (as indicated by the FFT) and the long\ntime required to dampen out the ﬁfth harmonic as indicated\nby the spectrogram, suggested that the system had a resonant\npoint near the ﬁfth harmonic frequency. The absence of a\ndominant ﬁfth harmonic element in event 1 (and the presence\nof it in event 2) current indicated that the transformer ener-\ngization had managed to excite this resonance. Transformer\nmagnetizing current is naturally rich in harmonics and thus,\nﬁrst excites, and then sustains this resonance. A simulation of\nthe system, performed in Open DSS software, shows (Fig. 7)\nthat the system has a resonant point near the sixth harmonic\nfor the positive sequence and near the ﬁfth harmonic for\nthe zero sequence current. The transformer impedance during\nenergization, will have a small inﬂuence on this resonant\npoint, so that the resonance would be seen closer to the ﬁfth\nharmonic for the zero sequence (since the transformer has a\nwye grounded-wye conﬁguration).\nAnother aspect of the issue that emerges from an inspection\nof Fig. 7 is that the zero sequence network has a resonant\nfrequency near the ﬁfth harmonic. The reader may recall that\nthe ﬁfth harmonic is, in fact, a negative sequence harmonic.\nThis highlights an important issue. The application of the\nFortescue transformation to decompose a set of phasors into\npositive, negative and zero sequence components, assumes a\nbalanced set of phasors. However, if the phasors are unbal-\nanced, then the traditional deﬁnitions of positive, negative and\nzero sequence do not hold. In other words, for an unbalanced\nset of voltages or currents, the ﬁfth harmonic can no longer\nbe considered to be a negative sequence harmonic. For 3-\nphase distribution systems, a slight unbalance in the voltages\nalways exists. Unbalanced events (such as a large single\nphase load energization. e.g. Arc furnace) can exacerbate the\nproblem even further. The interested reader may refer to [8]\nfor a more detailed understanding of the impact of unbalance\non harmonic analyses. Fig. 8 shows plots of single cycle\nRMS values of inrush current, following energization.

System resonant points plotted in Open DSS.\nunbalance between the currents has been calculated using\nthe method given in IEEE standard 112 [9]. The current\nunbalance immediately upon energization was close to 60%,\ndue to the suppressed phase C current. Interestingly, during\nthe same period the voltage unbalance remained less than 10%.\nDue to this unbalance, ﬁfth harmonic current no longer adds\nup to zero (phasor addition) and hence ﬂows into grounded\nneutral conductors, which provide a low impedance path. Thus,\nunbalance causes frequencies other than the triplen harmonics\nto show up in a zero sequence frequency scan. The unbalance\nin the system thus exacerbates the issue. This observation\nalso highlights the importance of running simulations with\nthree phase models rather than simply using a single phase\nor positive sequence representation of the circuit.\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\nT ime (s)\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\nC urrent (\nA )\nI a\nI b\nI c\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\nT ime (s)\n10\n20\n3 0\n40\n50\n60\nC\nurrent\nU n\n\u0000 alance (\n% )\nFig. 8. Single cycle RMS values of inrush current (left) and percent unbalance\nbetween them (right).\nAs a ﬁnal note, it is unknown as to whether it was distortion\naround the zero crossing, thermal overload due to harmonics\nor sustained unbalance that caused the load to trip. The load\nmanaged to ride through the voltage sags due to event 1 but\nlack of PQ monitors at the customer site hinder us from\nidentifying speciﬁc PQ aspects of event 2 that caused load\ntripping.\nIV. C ASE STUDY 2\nAs noted previously, this case is similar to Case 1, in the\nsense that the energization of PV transformers caused indus-\ntrial load to trip. However, unlike Case 1 (where harmonic\nresonance and system unbalance were the main contributing\nfactors), in Case 2 transformer energization caused voltage\ndistortion around the zero crossing of the fundamental voltage\nwhich ultimately caused industrial adjustable speed drives to\ntrip ofﬂine. A single line diagram of the system, provided\nby the utility, is shown in Fig. 9. As shown, the Solar Farm\nis located in the vicinity of a Steel Plant. Quite like case 1,\nthe composition of load and its topology at the plant were\nunknown.\nFig. 9. Single line diagram of the system showing the location of the Solar\nfarm and the Steel Plant.\nThe solar farm was connected to the utility via eight\ntransformers (wye grounded-wye) of 1400 kVAcapacity each.\nA 600 kvarcapacitor bank was connected near the solar farm\nfor voltage support. The utility conducted tests to see if the\nenergization of PV transformers caused any problems at the\nsteel plant (and monitored the PQ at the plant for the same).\nDuring energization, ringing between the transformers and the\nnearby capacitor bank were observed. The voltage and current\nwaveforms, recorded at the solar farm are shown in Fig. 10.\nThe worst case voltage sag resulting from the energization\ncaused single phase voltage at the steel plant to get reduced\nto about 78% of its nominal value. The plant load was able\nto ride through these sags. However, during some energizing\nevents, it was discovered that the multiple zero crossings due to\nharmonics (resulting from the ringing) 9, 10 and 11 caused DC\ndrives to trip ofﬂine. DC drives are typically line commutated,\nusing SCRs for their switching. The presence of multiple zero\ncrossings in the line voltage causes the circuits in such drives\nto commutate prematurely and trip ofﬂine. This was observed\nto be the case here. In other cases, it was observed that AC\ndrives (fed through a dedicated DC power supply) tripped\nofﬂine due to overvoltage. This can most likely be attributed\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06\n\u0001 ime (s)\n- \u0002 0\n- 20\n- 10\n0\n10\n20\n\u0002 0\nVoltage (\nk V)\nPh ase \u0003\nPh ase \u0004\nPh ase\nB\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06\n\u0001 ime (s)\n- 800\n- 600\n- 400\n- 200\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n\u0005 urrent (\n\u0006 )\nPh ase \u0003\nPh ase \u0004\nPh ase\nB\nFig. 10. V oltage (left) and Current (right) waveforms from trans former\nenergization.\nto harmonic distortion interfering with the DC power supply\n(that in turn caused changes in its output voltage).\nIn each of case 1 and case 2, the utilities staggered the\nenergization of the transformers. This was found to ﬁx the\nissue as it reduced the total magnitude of energization inrush\ncurrent (and hence reduced chances of exciting a resonance)\nfor case 1 and the total inductance seen by the capacitor bank\nfor case 2. However, utilities reported this ﬁx to be expensive\nas it required changes in existing infrastructure. Other possible\nsolutions and future work in this area have been laid out in\nthe last section of this paper.\nV. C ASE STUDY 3\nAs seen in the previous sections, the spectrum of trans-\nformer inrush current tends to be concentrated at low order\nharmonics, below the ﬁrst harmonic resonance frequency of\nmost transmission grids. The main cases where resonance at\nthese frequencies may be introduced is due to large shunt\ncapacitance such as capacitor banks, ﬁlter banks or long\nunderground cables. In many countries cable networks are\nused extensively in relation to the connection of solar PV due\nto their reduced visual impact. If a transformer is energized\nat a network location with low-order harmonic resonance,\nthe inrush current may excite a resonance condition giving\nrise to temporary overvoltages or severe, short-lived harmonic\ndistortion [10]. As large capacitor banks and long underground\ncables have very low losses, these overvoltages may persist for\nhundreds of milliseconds or longer. While these overvoltages\nmay be within the design capabilities of grid assets, they\nmay be outside of inverter high voltage ride-through require-\nments resulting in unscheduled disconnection of solar PV or\nother inverter-interfaced generation. The presence of severe\nharmonic distortion may also excite harmonic instability in\nnearby inverters, which could also lead to disconnection of\nthe solar PV generation [11].\nTo examine this issue a network was composed using\nEMTP-RV software. The network consists of an area of\n115 kVgrid with a 20 kmXLPE cable terminating at a busbar\nwith two transformers, both serving solar PV sites as shown in\nFig. 11. The solar PV inverters are modeled to include internal\ncontrol systems (inner control loops for dq-frame control as\nwell as outer control loop power control), inverter voltage and\nfrequency protection, inverter harmonic ﬁlter, and solar PV\nfarm cable network impedance. The aim of the study was to\ninvestigate the temporary overvoltages and harmonics which\nmay occur immediately after transformer energization.\nFig. 11. Simpliﬁed one line diagram of test network used to examine Cable-\nTransformer inrush resonance. Note that ‘OHL’ stands for Overhead Line.\nThe cable consists of three single-core cables with copper\nconductors, XLPE insulation and cross-bonded sheaths. A\nzero and positive-sequence impedance-frequency plot of the\nnetwork as seen by the 115 kVside of the solar PV busbars is\nshown in Fig. 12. The low-order resonance near 250 Hzdue\nto the cable can be clearly seen.\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\nF requency (Hz )\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n\u0007 m\np edance (o\n\b m)\nZero Sequence\nPositive Sequence\nFig. 12. Positive and Zero Sequence impedance frequency spectrum.\nWhen the 115 kVtransformer circuit breaker is closed to en-\nergize the unloaded Solar Farm #1 transformer at t = 120 ms,\nthe inrush current can be seen to excite a resonance with the\ncapacitance of the cable. This gives rise to temporary over-\nvoltages in excess of 1.25 puas illustrated by Fig. 13.\nThe overvoltage is seen to decay over the course of a few\nseconds. However, the initial magnitude is sufﬁcient to breach\nthe inverter over-voltage ride-through limit resulting in it trip-\nping 0.16 slater. In order to provide satisfactory performance\nin response to voltage sags, frequency excursions and other\ndynamic events inverter controllers require bandwidths of up\nto 1 kHz. The frequency response of these control loops may\nitself exhibit resonances which can be excited in the presence\nof sufﬁcient harmonic distortion [11]. The magnitude of the\nharmonic distortion after transformer energization is sufﬁcient\nto excite a resonance in the inverter control loops.\nThe inrush current on transformer #1 also excites sympa-\nthetic inrush [12] on transformer #2, which can be seen to\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 \t \t .5 4 4.5 5\n\n ime (s)\n\u000b\n150\n\u000b 100\n\u000b 50\n0\n50\n100\n150Voltage (\n\f V)\nFig. 13.

Conclusions\nThe case studies shown in the paper lead to the following\nbroad conclusions:\n• Energization of solar farms can have a negative impact\non power quality and cause disruption or disconnection\nof customer load. This is especially the case where the\ntransformer inrush current causes severe voltage distor-\ntion.\n• V oltage distortion may occur due to the magnitude of the\ninrush current of energizing multiple transformer simulta-\nneously or where the inrush current excites existing low\nfrequency resonances in the network.\n• In studying these phenomena it is critical to ensure that\nzero sequence impedance is represented and, preferably,\nphase-domain models of lines and cables are used. During\ntransformer inrush the grid voltage and current may\nbecome severely unbalanced, so grid models which only\ninclude positive sequence impedances will yield inaccu-\nrate or misleading results.\nB. Future Work\nBased upon the work done for these case studies, the\nfollowing avenues for future research were identiﬁed:\n• Estimating the contribution of inverter interfaces to volt-\nage distortion, both in the low frequency (up to 2 kHz)\nand the supraharmonic ( 2 to 150 kHz) frequency range\nusing improved models or nearby measurements.\n• Analyze the relative sizes of solar PV farms with regards\nto the grid and try to standardize these using DER\ninterconnection standards.\n• Work with utilities to study resonance issues for future\nPV installations during the planning stage. In the case\nof existing installations, solutions to ﬁx resonance issues\nneed to be worked upon.\n• Develop a better understanding of available and proposed\ntransformer inrush mitigation technologies.\nVII.
