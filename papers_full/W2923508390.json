INTRODUCTION\nWith the development of wireless communication systems,\nthe impedance transformers to convert a certain impedance\ninto another one are important for maximum power transfer.\nThese transformers are exploited for impedance-transforming\npower dividers and combiners [1]–[6], wireless power trans-\nfer, energy harvest [7], antenna feeding lines, and power\nampliﬁers. The simplest design is generally the most\npreferable for the engineering solution, and quarter-wave\nimpedance transformers are suitable for this purpose. How-\never, since input or output impedances of power transistors,\ntransmitter- and receiver-coils for wireless power transfer\nsystems and diodes for rectiﬁers are not always of real values,\ncomplex impedance transformers (CITs) to convert a com-\nplex impedance into another one are required.\nDiverse CITs have been suggested and can be classi-\nﬁed into six cases; the ﬁrst case consisting of only one\ntransmission-line section (TL) [8]–[11], the second one with\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Mohamed Kheir.\none TL and stubs [12]–[14], the third one comprising of two\nTLs and stubs [15]–[20], the fourth one being composed of\nthree TLs and stubs [21], [22], the ﬁfth one made of only\nseveral TLs [23], and the last one with coupled TLs [24]–[26].\nHowever, most of previous design methods [8],\n[12]–[17], [19]–[21], [23] cannot be possible for both com-\nplex termination impedances. All the conventional meth-\nods [8]–[26] cannot treat all possible complex termination\nimpedances due to no systematic design method available,\nand the conventional designs [12]–[26] are more complicated\nthan required. Among those methods, impedance transform-\ners [8], [19] with each only a single TL are recommendable,\ndue to powerful, simple, diverse applications and possible\nimplementation of all the other conventional designs. How-\never, those in [8] and [19] are possible only for one real\ntermination impedance, or, not for both complex termination\nimpedances.\nTo overcome the conventional problems [8], [19], the CITs\nwith each only one TL are suggested in this paper for both\ncomplex termination impedances, and allowed and forbid-\nden regions are suggested based on three mapping functions\n39288\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Ahn, M. M. Tentzeris: Complex Impedance Transformers Based on Allowed and Forbidden Regions\nwhich are for the ﬁrst time derived in this paper. The allowed\nand forbidden regions are historically for the ﬁrst time\nderived in [8], and followed by [19] and [27]. However,\nthey [8] are possible only for one real and one complex\ntermination impedances, those in [19] do not seem to be\ncorrect, referring to [20], and those in [27] is very brieﬂy\nintroduced with no completion. The design method for the\nboth regions in this paper is quite different from the graphical\nmethod in [8] which cannot be possible for both complex\ntermination impedances.\nEven though the CITs with each only one TL are pos-\nsible for both complex termination impedances, imaginary\nvalues of the characteristic impedances; too high value of\ncharacteristic impedances to fabricate; too long electrical\nlength; or small bandwidths are inevitable. To solve those\nproblems, three CITs are additionally proposed, adding one\nTL to the original TL, adding one open stub to the original\nTL, or adding one short stub to the original TL.\nSince the Smith charts with both allowed and forbidden\nregions give all the information about the bandwidths [5],\ncharacteristic impedances and electrical lengths [3], [8] of\nthe TL at a glance, they are very important for the effective\ndesigns without any additional complicated calculation or\nderivation process.\nFor the veriﬁcation of suggested theory, three cases located\nin forbidden regions are measured. One of them is transform-\ning (68 +j42.5) into (85 +j17) . The measured return loss\nis 45.9 dB at a design frequency of 1 GHz, and the bandwidth\nwith the 15-dB return loss is more than 100 %.\nII. COMPLEX IMPEDANCE TRANSFORMER WITH\nONLY ONE TRANSMISSION-LINE SECTION\nA. IMPEDANCE DOMAIN ANALYSES\nA CIT terminated in both complex impedances is depicted\nin Fig. 1(a). The CIT consists of only a single TL with the\ncharacteristic impedance of ZC and the electrical length of 2,\nand the two termination impedances of ZL and ZS are ZL =\nRL +jXL and ZS =RS +jXS where RL and RS are of positive\nreal values, and XL and XS are of real values including 0.\nIf the two termination impedances are normalized to the\nreal impedance RS of ZS in Fig. 1(b), they become to be\nzl = ZL\n/\nRS and zs = ZS\n/\nRS , and the characteristic\nimpedance of the TL is also to be zc =ZC\n/\nRS . Reﬂection\ncoefﬁcients 0l, 0s and input impedance of zin_s are indicated\nin Fig. 1(b). To have perfect matching at both complex termi-\nnation impedances, the normalized termination impedances\nzl and zs should be located on a constant reﬂection coefﬁcient\ncircle drawn on a Smith chart, from which the following\nrelation [8] holds;\n|0l|=|0s|, (1)\n0l =zl −zc\nzl +zc\n, 0 s =z∗\ns −zc\nz∗s +zc\n(1a)\nwhere zl = rl +jxl and zs = 1 +jxs. From the rela-\ntions in (1), the normalized characteristic impedance of zc is\nFIGURE 1. CITs. (a) Without normalization. (b) Termination and\ncharacteristic impedances normalized toRS .\nderived as\nzc =\n√\nrl |zs|2 −|zl|2\n1 −rl\n(2)\nThe design formula in (2) may also be obtained by substitut-\ning zl and zs into [8, eq. (2)] or [9, 31-9]. The input impedance\nzin_s in Fig. 1(b) is\nzin_s =zc\nzl +jzctan2\nzc +jzltan2 (3)\nFor the perfect matching at zs in Fig. 1(b), zin_s =z∗\ns should\nbe, from which the electrical length of 2may be found as\ntan2=zc\nrl −1\nrlxs −xl\n(4)\nFor the solution to zc in (2), z2\nc should be of positive real\nvalues, which leads to\n0 <rl <1;\n(\nrl −|zs|2\n2\n)2\n+xl2 < |zs|4\n4 (5a)\nrl >1;\n(\nrl −|zs|2\n2\n)2\n+xl2 > |zs|4\n4 (5b)\nrl =1;no solution (5c)\nwhere two cases of 0 <rl <1 and rl>1 are available, and\nno solution to zc exists, when rl = 1 in (5c). Depending\non the values of |zs|2, the two cases with |zs|2 > 1 and\n|zs|2 =1 are plotted in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively where\nhatched regions are allowed regions that allow positive real\ncharacteristic impedances of zc in (2) with only one TL.\nB. REFLECTION COEFFICIENT DOMAIN ANALYSES\nFor the analyses on a Smith chart, three boundary func-\ntions deﬁned in the impedance domain need to be mapped\nonto a Smith chart. The three are found from the equations\nin (2), (4), (5), which are\nf1 (rl,xl):\n(\nrl −|zs|2\n2\n)2\n+xl2 −|zs|4\n4 =0 (6a)\nf2 (rl,xl):rl −1 =0 (6b)\nf3 (rl,xl):rl −xl\nxs\n=0 (6c)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 39289\nH.-R. Ahn, M. M. Tentzeris: Complex Impedance Transformers Based on Allowed and Forbidden Regions\nThe two in (6a) and (6b) are for the characteristic impedance\nof zc in (2), and the two in (6b) and (6c) with xs ̸=0 are for\nthe electrical length of 2from (4). By the conformal mapping\nof 0l =(zl −1)/(zl +1), real and imaginary parts of the\nreﬂection coefﬁcient 0rl +j0il [8, eq.(7)] are written as\n0rl =\n(\nr2\nl −1\n)\n+x2\nl\n(1 +rl)2 +x2\nl\n(7a)\n0il = 2xl\n(1 +rl)2 +x2\nl\n, (7b)\nwhere zl =rl +jxl, also,\n(\n0rl − rl\n1 +rl\n)2\n+02\nil =\n( 1\n1 +rl\n)2\n(7c)\n(0rl −1)2 +\n(\n0il −1\nxl\n)2\n=\n(1\nxl\n)2\n(7d)\nThe equations in (7) indicate that a circle in zl−domain is\nconverted into another circle in 0l−domain on a Smith chart,\na line is also transformed into a circle, and the conformal\nmapping of zl into 0l is 1:1 mapping. Letting the mapping\nfunction of f1 (rl,xl)be Gf1 (0rl,0il), it is necessary to know\ntwo points together with a radius converted from f1 (rl,xl)\ndeﬁned in zl−domain in (6a), because they are sufﬁcient to\ndeﬁne a circle. The two are A (0, 0) and B (0, 2C ) in Fig. 2(a)\nwhere C is the center of the circle. Substituting (rl,xl)A =\n(0,0)into the two in (7a) and (7b) gives\n(rl,xl)A =(0,0)→(0rl,0il)A =(−1,0) (8)\nFIGURE 2. Hatched allowed regions. (a)|zs|2 > 1. (b)|zs|2 =1.\nThe value of 2C at B(2C, 0) in Fig. 2(a) is |zs|2 from (6a),\nwhich is converted into\n(rl,xl)B =\n(\n|zs|2 ,0\n)\n→(0rl,0il)B =\n(\n|zs|2 −1\n|zs|2 +1\n,0\n)\n(9)\nThe radius RGf1 of the circle of Gf1 (0rl,0il)is obtained from\nRGf1 =0rl_B −0rl_A\n2 (10)\nwhere 0rl_A and 0rl_B are real parts of (0rl,0il)A and\n(0rl,0il)B in (8) and (9), respectively.\nThe function of Gf1 (0rl,0il)is therefore obtained as\nf1 (rl,xl)→Gf1 (0rl,0il)\nGf1 :\n(\n0rl + 1\n1 +|zs|2\n)2\n+02\nil −\n(\n|zs|2\n1 +|zs|2\n)2\n=0\n(11)\nFIGURE 3. Precise description of a half circle ofGf1\n(0rl , 0il\n).\nA half circle of Gf1 (0rl,0il)is represented in Fig. 3 where\nthe circle passes through 0A and 0B, and the center of the\ncircle is 0C . The real values of 0C and 0B are −1/(1 +|zs|2)\nand (|zs|2 −1)/(1+|zs|2) as expressed. Substituting those real\nvalues of 0C and 0B into (7a) with xl =0, rl_C and rl_B are\nderived inversely as\nrl_C = |zs|2\n|zs|2 +2\n, rl_B =|zs|2 (12)\nwhere rl_C and rl_B are the corresponding real resistance\nvalues at 0C and 0B, respectively, in Fig. 3. In other words, for\nexample, if zs =1+j is given, the function of Gf1 (0rl,0il)is\na circle passing through two points (r l_A =0) and (r l_B =2)\non 0rl−axis in (8) and (9), and the center of the circle is\nrl_C =1/2 as in (12). When zs =1+j, the center of the circle\nin the impedance domain in Fig. 2(a) is (rl,xl)C =(1,0), but\nthe center of Gf1 in the reﬂection domain is not (rl,xl)C =\n(1,0) but (rl,xl)C =(1/2,0). That is, 1:1 mapping can be\nachieved only between the two circles in the impedance and\nreﬂect domains.\nThe mapping function of f2 (rl,xl)in (6b) is easily obtained\nby substituting rl =1 into (7c) to give\nf2 (rl,xl)→Gf2 (0rl,0il)\nGf2 :\n(\n0rl −1\n2\n)2\n+02\nil −\n(1\n2\n)2\n=0 (13)\nThe two functions in (11) and (13) are valid for both complex\ntermination impedances.\nWith |xs|varying, the circles expressing two functions of\nGf1 (0rl,0il)and Gf2 (0rl,0il)are plotted in an impedance\nSmith chart in Fig. 4. The circle of Gf2 (0rl,0il) is a ﬁxed\nrl =1 circle. The circles of Gf1 (0rl,0il) are dependent on\n39290 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH.-R. Ahn, M. M.

If the value of\n|xs|is larger, the radius of the Gf1 (0rl,0il) is greater, which\nmay be known from Fig. 3. Independently of the values of\n|xs|, the family of Gf1 are passing through three points of\n(0rl,0il) =(−1,0) and 1±jx s. With |xs|larger, the centers\nof the circles of Gf1 are closer to the origin of the Smith chart.\nThe two functions in (11) and (13) are independent of the sign\nof xs, but the electrical lengths of 2are dependent on the sign\nof xs. In a similar way, the mapping function of f3 (rl,xl),\nGf3 (0rl,0il)is found as\nf3 (rl,xl)→Gf3 (0rl,0il)\nGf3 :02\nrl +\n(\n0il +1\nxs\n)2\n−\n(\n1 + 1\nx2s\n)\n=0 (14)\nBy varying xs, the family of circles of Gf3 (0rl,0il)are drawn\nin Fig. 5 where the cases with xs >0 are in Fig. 5(a), while\nthose with xs < 0 in Fig. 5(b). The family of circles meets\nzs, and as the value of |xs|approaches to inﬁnite, the center\nof circles Gf3 (0rl,0il)goes to the origin of the impedance\nSmith chart, and the radius becomes to be unity. Since the\nbehavior of three circles in (11), (13) and (14) is dependent\non |zs|2, the cases of |zs|2 >1 and |zs|2 =1 will be discussed\nfurther.\nC. ALLOWED AND FORBIDDEN REGIONS\nAs far as xs is of real values, |zs|2 ≥1 is always satisﬁed, and\nthree cases, xs >0, xs <0 (|zs|2 >1) and xs =0 (|zs|2 =1)\nare possible. The three cases are different from each other,\nwhich should be studied differently. The conditions for a real\nvalue of zc are\nGf1 (0rl,0il)<0 and G f2 (0rl,0il)>0 (15a)\nGf1 (0rl,0il)>0 and G f2 (0rl,0il)<0 (15b)\nFIGURE 5. Family ofGf3\n(0rl , 0il\n) circles. (a)xs > 0. (b)xs < 0.\nThe condition in (15a) for the reﬂection domain on the Smith\nchart corresponds to that in (5a) in the impedance domain,\nwhile that in (15b) corresponds to that in (5b). The regions\nsatisfying (15) with xs >0 are illustrated in Fig. 6(a). The two\ncircles of Gf1 (0rl,0il)and Gf2 (0rl,0il)meet at two points,\none of which is zs and another of which is z∗\ns . The third circle\nof Gf3 (0rl,0il)passes through zs and determines the sign of\nthe electrical lengths of 2. If a complex impedance of zl is\nlocated within the hatched region, real value of zc is possible,\nand therefore a single TL in Fig. 1(b) can transform zl into zs.\nDue to the fundamental reason, the hatched region in Fig. 6(a)\nis called allowed region which may be divided into four I +,\nII+, III+and IV+where the letter of ‘‘A’’ of AI+, AII+, AIII+\nand AIV + indicates allowed regions, the sign of +in the\nsuperscript means that xs is positive, and +or – sign located\nnext to those is the sign of electrical length of 2. The positive\nor negative electrical length of 2means 2 <90◦or 2 >\n90◦, respectively. If zl is located on the circle of Gf3 (0rl,0il),\n2=90◦.\nWith a given xs < 0, the conditions for a real value of\nzc are the same as those in (15), but the function of Gf3 is\ndifferent from that with xs >0. Therefore each region is also\ndifferent. The allowed regions with xs < 0 is illustrated in\nFig. 6(b) where the three circles meet at zs. The sign of – in\nthe superscript means that xs is negative. Compared to the\ncase with xs > 0, the regions of AI −and AII −are bigger\nthan those of AI + and AII +. The sign of +or – located\nnext to those is also the sign of electrical length of 2. The\ncase with xs=0 is described in [8, Fig. 6(c)]. The outside of\nthe allowed regions is forbidden regions, and two types are\navailable. They are in Fig. 6(d) and (e) where the sign of +\nor – in the superscript indicates the sign of xs, as well.\nIII. SOLUTION TO RESTRICTIONS\nIn general, the two equations (2) and (4) may be used for\nthe CITs terminated in both complex impedances. However,\nthere are restrictions, and four of them are imaginary val-\nues of zc, too high value of the characteristic impedance of\nVOLUME 7, 2019 39291\nH.-R. Ahn, M. M.

(c) Allowed regions withxs =0.\n(d) Forbidden regions withxs ̸=0. (e) Forbidden regions withxs =0.\nzc to fabricate, too long electrical length of 2 and small\nbandwidths. To solve those problems, allowed and forbidden\nregions are required. For example, if the load of zl is located\nin a forbidden region, the resulting zc is of imaginary value.\nIn this case, the load of zl should be moved into one of allowed\nregions where the electrical length of the CIT in Fig. 1(b) is\nless than 90 ◦for the compact designs.\nFor this purpose, any circuit to transform the original com-\nplex impedance of zl into a wanted region is necessary, and\nthe simplest circuits are those made by only one TL. They\nare a TL, an open stub and a short stub in Fig. 7 where the TL\nhas the characteristic impedance of zt and the electrical length\nof 2t in Fig. 7(a), while an open stub with the characteristic\nimpedance of zo and the electrical length of 2◦and a short\nstub with zsh and 2sh are indicated in Fig. 7(b) and (c),\nrespectively.\nIn this case, the complex load of zl is transformed into three\ninput impedances of zin_t , zin_o and zin_sh as shown in Fig. 7,\nFIGURE 7. Three asymmetric CITs with two elements. (a) A TL added\n(CVT). (b) An open stub added (CCTU).

Since the asymmet-\nric impedance transformers [3] are named based on how to\nmove the loads, the CITs in Fig. 7(a), (b) and (c) can be\nnamed CVT, CCTU and CCTD, respectively where CCTU or\nCCTD means that the admittance load is moved upwards or\ndownwards along a constant conductance circle on the Smith\nchart.\nA.

(2) gives an imag-\ninary value, which indicates the transformation of zl into zs\nwith only one TL is impossible. To make it feasible, one of\nthe three circuits in Fig. 7 may be used.\n39292 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH.-R. Ahn, M. M. Tentzeris: Complex Impedance Transformers Based on Allowed and Forbidden Regions\nFIGURE 8. Illustration of an example with a forbidden region of FI+.\nTo solve this problem, the three functions in (11), (13)\nand (14) are plotted in Fig. 8 where the complex load of zs\nis located at the point where the three functions meet, and the\nload of zl is located in the forbidden region of FI +. To make\nit feasible, the load of zl should be moved into one of allowed\nregions where the resulting electrical length of 2ct , 2co or\n2csh in Fig. 7 is less than 90 ◦. The possible allowed region\nis AII +, +or AIV +, +in Fig. 6(a). For this, the CVTs\nin Fig. 7(a) and the CCTDs in Fig. 7(c) are good candidates,\nand the CVTs will be discussed.\nEven if the input impedance of zin_t in Fig. 7(a) is changed\nwith the TL with zt and 2t , the three functions are the same\nas far as zs is ﬁxed. Therefore, the Smith chart in Fig. 8 is for\nzin_t =at +jbt where at and bt are real and imaginary values\nof zin_t in (16a) and Fig. 7(a).\nWith ﬁxing 2t at 20 ◦ and with varying zt in Fig. 7(a),\nthe resulting input impedances of zin_t are described in Fig. 8.\nWhen zt = 1, the input impedance of zin_t is still in the\nregion of AI +, −and therefore the electrical length of 2ct\nin Fig. 7(a) is negative, or, greater than 90 ◦. When zt =0.6,\nthe input impedance of zin_t is in the region of AIV +, +and\ntherefore the electrical length of 2ct is positive, but close\nto 90 ◦, because the point of zin_t with zt =0.6 is located\nclose to the function of Gf3 . When zt = 0.5, the input\nimpedance of zin_t is located farther from the function of Gf3 .\nTherefore, the electrical length of 2ct should be less than\nthat with zt = 0.6. In this way, the three functions give\nTABLE 1. Design Parameters of CVTs in Fig. 7(a) for FI+.\nall the information for zct and 2ct , and the detailed design\nparameters are given in Table 1. Without calculations, the\ncharacteristic impedances of zct can be known approximately.\nFor the case of zt =1 in Fig. 8, the perpendicular bisector of\nthe line connecting zs and its corresponding zin_t meets the\nreal axis of 0rl at one point. The point indicates the charac-\nteristic impedance of zct , referring to [3, Fig. 5], [8, Figs. 3,4]\nand zct = 1.709 in Table 1. In this way, even when the\nresulting value from (2) is imaginary, the CITs are possible\nby adding only one element more.\nB. MEASUREMENTS OF THE CASES\nIN FORBIDDEN REGIONS\nSeveral CVTs in Fig. 7(a), the termination impedances of zl\nof which are located in forbidden regions, are fabricated on\na substrate (RT/Duroid 5880,ε r =2.2, H =20 mil). In this\ncase, the load located in the forbidden region FI + is zl =\n(0.8+j0.5) with zs =(1+j0.2) as exempliﬁed in Fig. 8,\nthat in the forbidden region FII −is zl =(0.9-j0.6) with\nzs =(1-j0.3) , and that in the forbidden region of FIII +\nis zl =(1.4 +j0.7) with zs =(1 +j1) . The forbidden\nregions mean that the characteristic impedances of zc are of\nimaginary values when substituting those (z l and zs) into (2).\nThe design parameters are collected in Table 2 where RS is\nchosen depending on available resistance value, and ZL , ZS ,\nZT and ZCt are zl ∗RS , zs ∗RS , zt ∗RS and zct ∗RS , respectively.\nTABLE 2. Design Parameters of CVTs in Fig. 7(a) for Forbidden Regions.\nThe fabricated impedance transformers are demonstrated\nin Fig. 9 (a), (b) and (c) where the case of forbidden region\nof FI + is in Fig. 9(a), while those with forbidden regions\nII−and III +are in Fig. 9(b) and (c), respectively. The real\nvalues of ZL are fabricated with available chip resistors of RL ,\nand the imaginary values of ZL are realized with available\nchip inductor or capacitor together with TLs. The complex\nimpedance of ZL =(68 +j42.5) in Fig. 9(a) is realized\nwith a chip resistor with 68 , a TL with the character-\nistic impedance of 50  and the electrical length of 8.39 ◦\nat 1 GHz, and a chip inductor of 4.7 nH. That of ZL =\n(43-j28.67) in Fig. 9(b) is composed of a chip resistor with\n43 , a TL with 60 and 6.13 ◦and a chip capacitor with\n4.3 pF. That of ZL =(91 +j45.5) in Fig. 9(c) is made\nof a chip resistor with 91 , a TL with 70 and 8.43 ◦, and\na chip inductor with 5.1 nH. Each TL is used for trimming\nrequired capacitance or inductance values. The TLs with\nVOLUME 7, 2019 39293\nH.-R. Ahn, M. M. Tentzeris: Complex Impedance Transformers Based on Allowed and Forbidden Regions\nFIGURE 9. Fabricated CVTs for Forbidden regions. (a) FI+. (b) FII−. (c) FIII+.\nlow characteristic impedances in Table 2 are further reduced\nby use of MT (modiﬁed T-types) [28], [29, Fig. 6(b) with\n2a =0]. The TL with ZT =51 and 2t =35◦in Table 2 is\nreduced to 22.34 ◦long with N =4 in [28] and [29] as shown\nin Fig. 9(a). That with ZCt =50.94 and 2ct =20.11◦is\nreduced to 12.82 ◦long with N =2 as illustrated in Fig. 9(b).\nThat with ZCt =50.19 and 2ct =35.34◦is reduced to\n22.22◦long with N =3 as demonstrated in Fig. 9(c).\nFIGURE 10. Measured data transformation. (a) 50-termination\nimpedances. (b) Non 50-termination impedance.\nThe input impedances indicated by the arrows in Fig. 9 are\ncomplex conjugates of ZS for perfect matching. The termina-\ntion impedances of ZS in Fig. 9 are not 50 , and therefore\nthe 50-measurement system may not be suitable. One of ways\nfor the measurements is as follows. Letting the targeting\ncircuit for the measurements be a circuit (CVT) in Fig. 10(a),\nthe characteristics of the CVT are not changed by the ter-\nmination impedances. That is, impedance, admittance and\nABCD parameters of the CVT are not changed by the ter-\nmination impedances [4], but only the scattering parameters\nare changed by the termination impedances. The CVT is\nmeasured in the form in Fig. 10(a) where the characteristic\nimpedance and the physical length of the feeding line are\nassumed to be 50 and L, respectively. After measuring the\nscattering parameter of the CVT with the 50- termination\nimpedances, the measured data are saved in the ADS data\nitem in Fig. 10(b). Since the saved data contain the feeding\nlines, the feeding line effect should be removed by adding\na TL with the characteristic impedance of 50  but the\nphysical length of -L . For the measured data in Fig. 10(b),\nafter terminating the CVT in the real termination impedance\nof ZS , or, (87 +j17) , if it is simulated once more, the\nconverted data are obtained and can be the measured data with\nZS -termination impedance.\nFIGURE 11. Measured frequency responses of CVTs. (a) FI+. (b) FII−.\n(c) FIII+.\nThe frequency responses measured and predicted are com-\npared in Fig. 11 where the cases with forbidden regions FI +,\nFII− and FIII + are in Fig. 11(a), (b) and (c), respectively.\nThe measured scattering paramters of |S11|at 1 GHz are\n−45.9, −27.65 and −29.7 dB, respectively. The bandwidth\nwith 15-dB return loss of the CVT in forbidden region I\n39294 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH.-R. Ahn, M. M. Tentzeris: Complex Impedance Transformers Based on Allowed and Forbidden Regions\nin Fig. 11(a) is more than 100 %, and quite good agreements\nbetween measured and predicted results are achieved.\nEven though the imaginary parts of the termination\nimpedances of ZS and ZL are frequency-dependent, since all\nthe solutions to the characteristic impedances and electrical\nlengths are valid only at a design frequency, the frequency\nresponses with the ﬁxed ZS and ZL at fo, a design fre-\nquency, are correct to verify the suggested theory, referring\nto [6, Fig. 25].\nC. TOO HIGH CHARACTERISTIC IMPEDANCES AND\nTOO LONG ELECTRICAL LENGTHS\nAnother example is that characteristic impedance or electrical\nlength is too high or too long to fabricate. For the example of\na complex load of zl =(1.32 +j2.89) with a given zs =\n(1 +j), the load of zl is located in AI +, −. Substituting the\ntwo of zl and zs into eqs. (2) and (4) gives 2 =−44.53 ◦,\nor, 134.47 ◦and zc =4.83 . If the normalized impedance\nof RS is 50 , the real characteristic impedance becomes\n4.83∗50 which is very difﬁcult to fabricate with a general\nmicrostrip technology. Furthermore, the electrical length is\ntoo long (180 +2), 134.77◦.\nFIGURE 12. Variations of electrical lengths of2c◦and characteristic\nimpedance ofzco using the CCTU in Fig. 7(b) forzl =(1.32 +j2.89) \nand zs =(1 +j) . (a)2c◦. (b)zco.\nTo make the unfeasible characteristic impedance viable\nand to reduce the size, to move the load of zl into AIV +, +\nis needed. For this, the CCTU in Fig. 7(b) is an alternative\nchoice. Fixing zo =1 and varying 2o, the calculation results\nof 2c◦ and zco in Fig. 7(b) are plotted in Fig. 12 where\nthe electrical lengths of 2c◦ are in Fig. 12(a), while the\ncharacteristic impedances of zco in Fig. 12(b).\nWith the open stub longer, 2c◦and zco decrease in Fig. 12,\nand when the open stub is 8.84 ◦ long, the load of zin_o\nin Fig. 7(b) is located on G f3 , leading to zco = 2.76 and\n2c◦ = 90◦. When open stubs are 12 ◦ and 15 ◦ long,\nthe values of zco and 2c◦can be calculated as ( zco, 2c◦) =\n(2.61,78.59◦) and (2.55, 68.76 ◦), respectively. Even with the\nnormalized impedance of 50 , the characteristic impedance\nof zco = 2.76 can be feasible with microstrip technology.\nThree cases with the open stub lengths of 2◦ =8.84◦, 12 ◦\nand 15◦were simulated at the design frequency of 1 GHz, and\nthe frequency responses are compared in Fig. 13 where the\nfrequency responses for three cases are about the same, even\nwhen the sizes (electrical lengths) are different from each\nother. The simulation results in Figs. 12 and 13 demonstrate\nthat adding just an open stub in Fig. 7(b) makes the unfeasible\nimpedance transformer feasible along with the size reduction\neffect.\nFIGURE 13. Frequency responses of CCTUs for2◦=8.84◦, 12◦and 15◦.\nD. SMALL BANDWIDTHS\nWhen the bandwidth of the CIT with only one TL is con-\nsidered to be small, the three CITs in Fig. 7 can be used as\nwell. One case with ZL =(100-j30) at f0 and ZS =50 \nin [8, Fig. 20(a)] can be exempliﬁed. The complex impedance\nof ZL is located in AIV 0,+in Fig. 6(c), leading to real value\nof ZC and the electrical length of 2 less than 90 ◦. Using\nthe two design formulas in (2) and (4), the values of ZC\nand 2 in Fig. 1 can be calculated as ZC = 76.8  and\n2 =68.7◦. In this case, if the bandwidth is not thought to\nbe desirable, the CVT in Fig. 7(a) can be used to increase the\nbandwidth.\nVarying ZT and ﬁxing 2t at 38.86 ◦, the design parame-\nters for the CVTs in Fig. 7(a) are listed in Table 3 where\nZT =zt RS and ZCt =zct RS .The frequency responses of the\nCVTs in Table 3 are plotted in Fig. 14 where the complex\ntermination impedance ZL is frequency-dependent such as\nZL =[100−j30\n{\ncot\n(\nπ\n4\nf\nf0\n)}\n] .\nTABLE 3.

Design Parameters for CVTs in Fig. 15(b) Fixing atZT =82.1 ,\n2t =38.86◦and Zo =50 .\nThe frequency response of the CIT with only one TL\nin Fig. 1 is expressed with a dotted line, while those of the\nCVTs in Fig. 7(a) for ZT =80, 82.1, 84 and 86 are solid\nlines with the symbols. Referring to the design parameters\nin Table 3, higher values of ZT give longer electrical lengths\n(2ct ). The 15-dB return-loss bandwidth is the widest with\nZT =86 , and the bandwidth with ZT =82.1is not so\ndesirable.\nFIGURE 15. CVTs. (a) CVTs in Fig. 7(a). (b) Other type of CVT.\nHowever, if converting the TL with ZCt ,2ct into a T -type\nwith N = 1 [28], [29], the bandwidths can be enlarged.\nFig. 15 shows converting the TL with ZCt ,2ct into a T-type\nwhere the T-type in Fig. 15(b) consists of two identical TLs\nwith the characteristic impedance of Zm and the electrical\nlength of 2m and an open stub with Zo and 2o. Vary-\ning Zm and ﬁxing Zo at 50 , the design parameters for\nZT = 82.1  and 2t = 38.86◦ in Table 3 are listed\nin Table 4 where the design parameters for ZT = Zm =\n82.1are the same as those in [19, Table 1 for broadband].\nFrequency responses in Table 4 are plotted in Fig. 16 for Zms\nwhere the bandwidth for Zm =73 is the widest, 280 %\n(0.68-3.48 f0). In any case, the bandwidths in Fig. 16 are all\nwider than that with ZT =82.1in Fig. 14 and that for the\nCIT with only one TL.\nFIGURE 16. Frequency responses of CVTs in Fig. 15(b).\nE. OTHER CITs\nIn addition to those in Fig. 7, several other CITs can be\nintroduced by combining those in Fig. 7, converting the TLs\ninto T-types or 5−types, or transforming the TLs into several\nparallel TLs. The one in Fig. 15(b) is one of them.\nFIGURE 17. Other topologies of CITs. (a) CIT with a single TL. (b) CIT with\ntwo parallel TLs for a single TL. (C) CCTU in Fig. 7(b). (d) Converting a TL of\nCCTU into5−type.\nThe single TL in Fig. 1 can be converted into two parallel\nTLs as shown in Fig. 17(a) and (b). The admittance parame-\nters of the single TL in Fig. 17(a) are\n[YS] = j\nYC\n[−cot2 csc2\ncsc2 −cot2\n]\n(18)\nwhere YC =Z−1\nC . Those of the parallel TLs in Fig. 17(b) are\n[YP] = j\nYa\n[−cot2a csc2a\ncsc2a −cot2a\n]\n+ j\nYb\n[−cot2b csc2b\ncsc2b −cot2b\n]\n(19)\n39296 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH.-R. Ahn, M. M. Tentzeris: Complex Impedance Transformers Based on Allowed and Forbidden Regions\nwhere Ya = Z−1\na , 2a, Yb = Z−1\nb and 2b are character-\nistic impedances and electrical lengths of the parallel TLs\nin Fig. 17(b). By equating (18) to (19), the design formulas\nfor Zb and 2b can be expressed as\nZ−1\nb =Yb\n=\n√\nY 2\nC +Y 2a +2YC Ya (cot2cot2a−csc2csc2a)\n(20a)\ncos2b =\n( YC cot2−Yacot2a\nYC csc2−Y acsc2a\n)\n(20b)\nTherefore, if the information about the single TL with ZC\nand 2is known, the implementation for the parallel TLs is\npossible in any case under the condition of real values of Zb\nin (20).\nFor the CCTU in Fig. 7(b), converting the TL with ZCo and\n2co in Figs. 7(b) and 17(c) into a 5-type in [28, eq. (12) with\nN =1] gives the topology in Fig. 17(d), where the two open\nstubs located on the left side can be combined into one open\nstub. The two CITs in Fig. 17(b) and (d) are the same as those\nin [19, Figs. 4(b) and Fig. 8(d)], respectively.\nF. GUIDE LINE FOR DESIGNS\nFor the readers, a guide line to make use of the allowed\nand forbidden regions is necessary. When the two com-\nplex impedances are given, just substitute the two values\ninto (2) and (4). If the calculation results are satisﬁed, no fur-\nther attempt is necessary. If the calculation result of electrical\nlength is negative, add 180 ◦to make it positive. In this case,\nthe electrical length of the CIT is greater than 90 ◦. If the\nresulting values are thought to be long and desired to be\nshortened, draw three functions in (11), (13), (14) on the\nSmith chart to move one complex load into one of suitable\nregions. The cases in Sec. III. C are good examples for this.\nIf the calculation results of the characteristic impedances\nare of imaginary values, they are in the forbidden regions.\nTo make the design possible, one complex load should be\nmoved into one of allowed regions where the electrical\nlengths are less than 90 ◦. The measured results in Fig. 11,\nFig. 8 and Tables 1 and 2 are the good examples for this. If the\ncalculated characteristic impedance is too high to realize,\nthe good example is in Fig. 13. If the bandwidth is desired\nto be enlarged, the good examples are treated in Sec. III. D.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, a simple and powerful design method was sug-\ngested for the CITs. The simplest circuit is only one TL, and\ntherefore the study on the CITs with each only one TL was\ncarried out for both complex termination impedances. How-\never, there are restrictions such as imaginary values of char-\nacteristic impedances, too high characteristic impedances,\ntoo long electrical lengths to fabricate or small bandwidths.\nTo solve such problems, allowed and forbidden regions\nwere deﬁned based on the three mapping functions which\nwere derived for the ﬁrst time in this paper, and other sim-\nple circuits adding one TL more (TL, open or short stub)\nwere suggested. Based on CVTS in Fig. 7(a), three CITs\nin forbidden regions, or, imaginary values of characteris-\ntic impedances of the CITs with each only one TL, were\nfabricated and measured. The systematical research on the\nallowed and forbidden regions for both complex termination\nimpedances may be considered as the ﬁrst trial. Since the\nsymmetric in Fig. 1 and the asymmetric CITs in Fig. 7 are\nbasic elements, diverse applications are expected for wireless\npower transfer systems, power dividers with harmonic sup-\npressions, ring hybrids and ﬁlters.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H.-R.
