    "abstract": "Context: The research volume is continuously increasing. Manual analysis of large topic scopes and continuously updating literature studies with the newest research results is effort intensive and, therefore, difficult to achieve. Objective: To discuss possibilities and next steps for using LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in the mapping study process. Method: The research can be classified as a solution proposal. The solution was iteratively designed and discussed among the authors based on their experience with LLMs and literature reviews. Results: We propose strategies for the mapping process, outlining the use of agents and prompting strategies for each step. Conclusion: Given the potential of LLMs in literature studies, we should work on a holistic solutions for LLM-supported mapping studies.",
