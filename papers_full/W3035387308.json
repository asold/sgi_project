This is the authorship veriﬁcation problem [Koppel and\nSchler, 2004], which has important applications in broad do-\nmains, e.g., to detect fraud or phish in cybersecurity, to detect\nplagiarism in research, and to assist forensic investigation for\nthe judiciary.\nNumerous authorship veriﬁcation methods have been in-\ntroduced to tackle this problem [Stamatatos, 2009]. Most of\nthese approaches focus on ﬁnding features that can effectively\n\u0003Contact Author\ncharacterize writing styles [Abbasi and Chen, 2008 ]. Char-\nacter level tri-grams is shown to be effective for authorship\nanalysis [Bevendorff et al., 2019b]. There are also works try-\ning to address this problem from the perspective of compres-\nsion [Khmelev and Teahan, 2003; Halvani et al., 2017 ] and\nthe distribution of function words [Koppel and Schler, 2004].\n[Zhao et al., 2006] demonstrates that the POS tag is effective\nto characterize the writing styles from the perspective of syn-\ntax. However, they only use simple distributions to represent\nthe pattern of each author, which is insufﬁcient to capture the\nlocal correlations in the sequence.\nRecently, deep learning has achieved exceptional successes\nin many natural language processing problems. However,\napplying deep learning on the authorship veriﬁcation prob-\nlem faces a major challenge: the amount of training texts\nfor each author is extremely limited, which poses signiﬁcant\nchallenges to the training of neural networks that have a large\nnumber of parameters.\n[Bagnall, 2015] is one of the few in applying deep learn-\ning to the authorship veriﬁcation problem. They attempt to\naddress the above challenge by building a character-level lan-\nguage model with a shared RNN layer and a separate output\nlayer for each author to encode the author-speciﬁc writing\nstyles. Their method sits at the ﬁrst place in the PAN-15 au-\nthorship veriﬁcation competition and demonstrates the great\npotential of deep learning for authorship veriﬁcation. How-\never, we ﬁnd experimentally that character-level RNN has\ndifﬁculties in learning syntactic information with a limited\nnumber of samples. In addition, although their model uses\na shared RNN layer, the separate fully-connected output lay-\ners for each author have to learn from scratch independently,\nwhich may lead to sub-optimal language models. This also\nmakes it difﬁcult for their model to distinguish author-speciﬁc\nwriting styles from common writing patterns shared by every-\none.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel POS-level gated lan-\nguage model to capture the author-speciﬁc syntactic writing\nstyles in a data-efﬁcient way. As shown in Figure 2, we uti-\nlize a POS tagger pre-trained on a large external data set to\nconvert the raw inputs into sequences of POS tokens. The ex-\nternal author-agnostic syntactic information comes with the\nPOS tagger limits the parameter space of our language model\nto the vicinity of common syntactic patterns. This greatly re-\nduces the number of the effective parameters and enables the\nProceedings of the Twenty-Ninth International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-20)\n4025\nKnown Author Unknown Author Same?\nA   beautiful   lake   lies   at   the   foot   of   the   hill   .

Note that they are unrealistically simpliﬁed since typically it requires at least a few hundred\nwords to decently characterize an author’s writing style. The two sentences in the ﬁrst case express similar meanings, but their syntactic styles\nare completely different. In the second case, the syntactic styles of the two sentences are similar, but the topics are different. The PoS tagset\nused here is the universal PoS tagset.\nmodel to focus on the details of each author’s special syntac-\ntic styles.\nAlso, we use a shared fully-connected layer and a set of\nindependent fully-connected layers to respectively learn the\nshared syntactic patterns and each author’s special syntactic\nwriting styles. A gate unit shared between authors is respon-\nsible for deciding whether to use author-speciﬁc information\nat different positions of the texts. The rationale behind this\ndesign is that we assume that only a small part of the patterns\nappeared in the POS sequences comes from author-speciﬁc\nwriting styles, while most patterns come from the standard\nsyntax. This structure has two major beneﬁts: (i) the gate\ncan prevent the model from overﬁtting to each author’s rather\nlimited training data since it makes the decision based on the\nentire training set, and (ii) learning common syntactic pat-\nterns with a small set of shared parameters makes the lan-\nguage model more data-efﬁcient and accurate.\nTo summarize, our main contributions are as follows:\n\u000fWe propose a novel POS-level language model to effec-\ntively encode the topic-agnostic syntactic writing style\nfor each author. As far as we know, we are the ﬁrst to\nconduct authorship veriﬁcation by capturing the author-\nspeciﬁc correlations in the sequences of POS tokens\nwith language models.\n\u000fWe propose a novel gated architecture to learn the\nauthor-speciﬁc language models by utilizing a relatively\nsmall group of parameters to learn the common syntac-\ntic patterns shared across all authors. The model is data-\nefﬁcient and less prone to overﬁtting.\n\u000fExtensive empirical results on four publicly available\ndatasets demonstrate that our model can effectively learn\neach author’s unique syntactic writing style and achieve\nsigniﬁcant accuracy improvements compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods, especially in cross-topic sce-\nnarios (over 5% in terms of AUC-ROC).\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Problem Statement\nSuppose there is a group of authorsA, for each authorai 2A\nwe have a small set of texts Si = fsi\n1;si\n2;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;si\nkgthat is\nknown to be written by ai. Now there is also a text of un-\nknown author denoted as qt, the purpose of authorship ver-\niﬁcation is to determine whether qt is written by author ai.\nfai;qtgis called an authorship veriﬁcation case. Figure 1\nshows two toy cases.\n2.2 Language Model for Authorship Veriﬁcation\nThe core idea of neural language model [Bengio et al., 2003]\nis learning a neural network to model the conditional prob-\nability P(wijw0;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi\u00001) for each sequence w0;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wN .\nw0;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi\u00001 is called context and wi is a token that is ei-\nther a character or a word. Typically, this model consists of\ntwo components: a recurrent neural network unitfsynthesize\nthe correlations from the context into a hidden representation\nhi = f(hi\u00001;wi\u00001); and a fully-connected decoding layer g\nto map the hidden representation to the probability distribu-\ntion of next token: P(wijw0;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi\u00001) =g(hi).\nTo conduct authorship veriﬁcation, a set of author-speciﬁc\nlanguage models can be learned for each author respectively.\nEach author’s special writing habits will lead to differences\nin learned conditional probability P(wijw0;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;wi\u00001), and\na text is expected to have high probability with respect to its\nsincere author’s language model.\n3 Methods\nFigure 2 gives an overview of the gated POS-level author-\nspeciﬁc language model. First, we convert the raw texts into\nthe sequences of POS tokens. These sequences are then em-\nbedded and fed into a vanilla RNN shared by all authors to\ncapture the context information. On top of that, we apply\ngated decoding to predict the next token in the sequence.\n3.1 POS-Level Language Model\nInstead of the traditional character-level language model, we\npropose to use a novel POS-level language model to learn\nauthor-speciﬁc syntactic writing styles. Speciﬁcally, we uti-\nlize a POS tagger pre-trained on a large external data set\n[Matthew and Ines, 2015; Qi et al., 2018] to convert the raw\ntexts into sequences of POS tokens. Then we learn author-\nspeciﬁc language models upon these sequences, that is, pre-\ndict the next POS token based on previously observed POS\nsequence. The POS-level language model can effectively\ncapture the syntactic writing styles with limited training data\nwhile the character-level language model often fails to do so.\nWhy Is Syntactic Writing Style Important for\nAuthorship Veriﬁcation?\nThe syntactic writing style is important because it is topic-\nagnostic. Consider the two toy examples in Figure 1. The\nProceedings of the Twenty-Ninth International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-20)\n4026\ntwo sentences in the ﬁrst case convey similar meaning with\nexactly the same words, but the arrangement of their POS to-\nken sequences are completely different. For the second case,\nthe two sentences have different topics but similar POS token\nsequences. It is evident that the syntactic writing style repre-\nsented by the arrangement pattern of POS token sequences is\nmore generalizable for authorship veriﬁcation in cross-topic\nscenarios.\nWhy Can POS Level Language Model Better Learn\nSyntactic Writing Style?\nThe language model essentially models the joint probability\ndistribution of a sequence of discrete random variables. This\ndistribution has an exponentially sized sample space, thus the\nlanguage model will need a large amount of training data to\nexplore this huge sample space and accurately ﬁt the distribu-\ntion. However, in the authorship veriﬁcation problem, there\nare typically not enough training data to do this. As a result,\nthe char-level language model is likely to overﬁt to some spe-\ncial local correlations in the training set.\nTo address this problem, a potential solution is to lever-\nage external knowledge to constraints the size of the sample\nspace. We can consider that there is a subspace consisting\nof all the ”correct” sentences obeying the common syntac-\ntic rules in the sample space. Each author will have a dif-\nferent probability distribution in this subspace according to\ntheir syntactic writing style. With this intuition, we lever-\nage the general author-independent syntactic rules obtained\nfrom POS taggers trained on external large-scale data sets to\nlimit the sample space of the language model to the vicin-\nity of ”correct” sentences, enabling the author-speciﬁc lan-\nguage models to focus on each author’s subtle syntactic style.\nFrom another perspective, the vocabulary size of the POS is\nonly 19, compared to the character (80) and the word (sev-\neral thousand). This greatly reduces the number of effec-\ntive parameters of the model while retaining its expressive\npower. Besides POS tags, we also explored the possibility of\nusing more explicit syntactic information obtained from de-\npendency parsing. However, it performs consistently worse\nthan POS tags.\n3.2 Gated Neural Language Model\nGiven a sequence of POS tokens P = fwtgm\nt=1 known to\nbe written by author ai 2A, we ﬁrst convert them to em-\nbeddings fetgm\nt=1 with a embedding layer. Then we generate\nthe representation of context fhtgm\nt=1 utilizing a vanilla RNN\nunit to capture the correlations in the POS sequence:\nht = RNN(ht\u00001;et\u00001) (1)\nThe parameters of the embedding layer and the RNN are\nshared between all authors. We choose vanilla RNN rather\nthan more powerful variance such as LSTM because we ﬁnd\nexperimentally that LSTM typically provides rather limited\nperformance improvements. We speculate that this might be\ndue to the limited training data which prevents the LSTM to\nlearn meaningful long-range correlations.\nThen, the representation of context is fed into a decoder to\ngenerate the estimation of the distribution over the next token.\nThis decoder consists of three parts:\n×\nADP    DET     NOUN     ADP    DET\nAt   the  foot   of   the\nPOS tagger\nthe   foot   of   the   hill\nDET      NOUN     ADP    DET     NOUN\nEmbedding layer\n1−𝜎(∙) 𝜎(∙)\nRNN layer\nFully connected \ndecoder\nGate structure\nCross entropy loss\nbetween prediction\nand next POS token\nSoftmaxAuthor-\nspecific\nShared\nbetween\nauthors\n×\n+\nFigure 2: Gated neural language model structure overview.\n(i) A shared fully-connected layer with parameters\nfWshare;bsharegto learn the common syntactic writ-\ning patterns among all authors:\nsshare\nt = Wshareht + bshare (2)\n(ii) A separate fully-connected layer with parameters\nfWai ;bai gfor each author ai 2 A to learn special\nsyntactic writing styles:\nsai\nt = Wai ht + bai (3)\n(iii) The ﬁnal output is the linear weighted average of the\noutputs of the previous two parts performed by a shared\ngate unit parameterized by fWgate;bgateg:\nsgate\nt = \u001b(Wgateht + bgate) (4)\nlogitsai\nt = sgate\nt \nsshare\nt + (1\u0000sgate\nt ) \nsai\nt (5)\nFinally, a softmax function is applied to the raw logits out-\nput to obtain the author-speciﬁc estimated distribution of the\nnext token:\n^P\nai\n(wtjfwkgt\u00001\nk=1) =softmax (logitsai\nt ) (6)\nTo train the network, we minimize the sum of the cross-\nentropy loss between the estimated distribution and the\nground-truth next token on every step t.\nProceedings of the Twenty-Ninth International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-20)\n4027\nDataset Genre #Train #Test Char Level Length Word Level Length\nMin.

With this architecture, we\nlearn the shared writing patterns with a small set of shared\nparameters, and the author-speciﬁc parameters can focus on\neach author’s special writing styles.\nAlso, note that the parameters of the gate are shared, thus\nthe ratio to include author-speciﬁc information at each step\nof the text sequence is determined by all training data. As\na result, it will be less likely for the model to overﬁt to the\ntraining data of each author.\n3.3 Veriﬁcation\nAfter learning a language model for each known author re-\nspectively, to conduct authorship veriﬁcation on a test case\nfai;fwtgm\nt=1g, we need to calculate the losses z = fzai jai 2\nAgof this text with respect to the language model of each\nauthor respectively:\nzai = L (ai;fwtgm\nt=1) (7)\n=\nmX\nt=1\n\u0010\n^P\nai\n(wtjfwkgt\u00001\nk=1);wt\n\u0011\n(8)\nThen, we normalize these losses:\nscore = zai \u0000mean(z)\nstd(z) (9)\nThis normalized loss for ai can be used as a score for clas-\nsiﬁcation. The smaller the loss, the more likely this text is\nwritten by the author ai.\nThe rationale behind this choice is that due to the inherent\nvariability of neural language models, it’s difﬁcult to directly\ncompare the losses of different texts with respect to the same\nlanguage model. Instead, we can only compare the losses\nof the same text with respect to different author’s language\nmodels.\n4 Experiments\nIn this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evalu-\nate the proposed method. First, we introduce the settings of\nthe experiments, including the datasets used for evaluation,\nthe baseline methods to compare, the implementation details\nof our method, and the metrics. Then we compare the per-\nformance of our proposed method with other state-of-the-art\nauthorship veriﬁcation methods. Finally, we conduct ablation\nstudies to evaluate the contribution of each component of our\nmodel.\n4.1 Data Sets\nAs shown in the Table 1, we used 4 publicly available author-\nship veriﬁcation datasets, which were widely used by previ-\nous studies [Halvani et al., 2017; Bevendorff et al., 2019a;\nBagnall, 2015; Halvani et al., 2018], with different genre and\nsizes. Each case in these datasets consists of exactly one doc-\nument of unknown authorship and at least one document from\na known author. PAN-15 comes from a well-known author-\nship veriﬁcation competition [Stamatatos et al., 2015 ]. Re-\ncently, the authors of PAN-15 conduct a detailed analysis of\nthe dataset and ﬁnd several deﬁcits such as special characters\nintroduced during the processing of the dataset and acciden-\ntal text overlap. Based on these insights, they constructed\nan improved authorship veriﬁcation corpus named Gutenberg\n[Bevendorff et al., 2019a]. This dataset eliminates the afore-\nmentioned bias and ﬂaws, enabling the dataset to evaluate the\nperformance of authorship veriﬁcation methods more fairly.\nTherefore, this dataset is considered the most important one\nin our experiments. Nevertheless, we still included the PAN-\n15 dataset for completeness. The Enron data set comes from\nthe public Enron emails dataset. The samples are manually\nselected and cleaned to make sure of the quality [Halvani et\nal., 2018]. The Reddit dataset is obtained from [Halvani et\nal., 2017].\nThese data sets are respectively divided into two parts, the\ndevelopment set, and the test set. The PAN-15 and Gutenberg\ndatasets have been pre-divided by the provider. The other two\ndatasets are randomly divided according to the ratio of 1: 4\nfollowing the common practice in the research of authorship\nveriﬁcation [Halvani et al., 2017].\n4.2 Competing Methods\nWe compare our model with ﬁve other methods, including\ntwo baseline methods, BAFF [Bevendorff et al., 2019a ] and\nits variation that use POS tags as inputs, two non-deep learn-\ning methods GLAD [H¨urlimann et al., 2015 ] and Compres-\nsion [Halvani et al., 2017], and a deep learning based method\nMultiHead [Bagnall, 2015], which won the 1st place on the\nProceedings of the Twenty-Ninth International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-20)\n4028\nMethods PAN-15 Gutenberg Enron Reddit\nAUC-ROC AUC-PR AUC-ROC AUC-PR AUC-ROC AUC-PR AUC-ROC AUC-PR\nBAFF 0:7445 0:7098 0:7026 0:6638 0:7439 0:6784 0:7420 0:6901\nBAFF-POS 0:6813 0:6345 0:6742 0:6854 0:6961 0:6652 0:6407 0:6111\nCompression 0:6400 0:6014 0:7633 0:7152 0:7810 0:7301 0:7689 0:7141\nGLAD 0:6528 0:6621 0:8443 0:8615 0:7191 0:7491 0:6795 0:6721\nMultiHead 0:8165 0:8244 0:7849 0:8084 0:9369 0:9618 0:8544 0:8737\nGatedLM 0:8434 0:8274 0:8912 0:8903 0:9497 0:9633 0: 8714 0:8782\nTable 2: Authorship veriﬁcation performance comparison.\nPAN 2015 author identiﬁcation task[Stamatatos et al., 2015].\nWe chose these methods because they are the state of the art\nin the ﬁeld of author veriﬁcation.\nWe reimplement the two baseline methods with Python,\nand MultiHead with PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2019]. For other\nmethods, we use codes obtained from their authors.\n4.3 Implementation Details\nWe implement the proposed method with PyTorch and run all\nthe experiments on a GPU with 11GB memory.\nHow to perform POS tagging is not the focus of this article,\ntherefore we rather arbitrarily choose the popular open-source\nPOS tagger Spacy [Matthew and Ines, 2015]. Other POS tag-\ngers such as StanfordNLP [Qi et al., 2018] can achieve simi-\nlar results.\nIn order to conduct fairly performance comparison to make\nsure the performance improvement of our method comes\nfrom the POS level language model and gated decoder, we\nuse the vanilla RNN same as MultiHead.\nThe most important hyperparameters of our model are the\nsize of the embedding layer and the size of the hidden layer.\nThese hyperparameters can be effectively selected on the de-\nvelopment set and do not vary much on different datasets.\nExcept for the Enron dataset where the best hidden size is 16,\non other datasets the model achieves the best results on the\ndevelopment set when the hidden size is 64.\nIn training, we follow the common practice to calculate the\ngradient with truncated backpropagation through time [Wer-\nbos and others, 1990; Graves, 2013 ]. Speciﬁcally, we trun-\ncated the gradient for 20 time-steps and perform gradient de-\nscent utilizing vanilla SGD optimizer combined with gradient\nclipping at 0.25. All models are trained for 100 epochs and\nthe learning rate is set to 5. With these settings, we achieve\nstable performance on the development set.\n4.4 Performance Evaluation Methods\nWe use two complementary indicators: AUC-ROC and AUC-\nPR to measure and compare model performance. The AUC-\nROC is the area under the ROC curve, summing up true pos-\nitives against false positives. The AUC-PR is the area under\nthe curve of precision against the recall. We use average pre-\ncision in [Manning et al., 2008 ], a widely-used method, to\ncalculate AUC-PR. We chose these two metrics because they\nare classiﬁcation-threshold-invariant metrics. It allows us to\nfocus on comparing the predictive power of each method. For\na speciﬁc application, a threshold can be chosen to trade be-\ntween precision and recall.\nDue to the inherent variation of the algorithm, the experi-\nmental results reported in this paper comes from the average\nof 10 independently running with the same setting.\n4.5 Performance Comparision\nThis section examines the performance of our method on\naforementioned datasets. There are two major questions we\naim to address:\n\u000fIs it necessary to utilize deep learning methods for au-\nthorship veriﬁcation problem?\n\u000fIs our method more accurate than the state-of-the-art\ndeep learning based method?\nThe AUC-ROC and AUC-PR performance of our method\nand other competing methods are listed in Table 2. It is ev-\nident that deep learning based methods MultiHead and our\nGatedLM outperform traditional models on all four datasets,\nwhich indicates that deep learning based methods can beat so-\nphisticated manually designed features. Also, notice that the\nBAFF on POS perform worse than the raw BAFF on charac-\nter. This implies that simply using distribution of POS tags is\nunable to unleash its full potential.\nComparing our method with MultiHead, we can obtain\nthe main result that the POS level information and the gated\nneural language model enable our method to achieve signif-\nicant performance improvement. In particular, our method\nachieves the most signiﬁcant performance improvement in\ncross-topic scenario on Gutenberg dataset.\n4.6 Ablation Study\nIn this section, we perform ablation studies on the two key\ncomponents of our proposed method to examine their contri-\nbution to performance improvement respectively. We aim to\nanswer the following three key questions:\n\u000fIs it necessary to share parameters between language\nmodels of authors?\n\u000fDoes our gated neural language model achieve perfor-\nmance improvement over the multi-head structure?\nProceedings of the Twenty-Ninth International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-20)\n4029\n\u000fDoes POS information have advantages over char infor-\nmation, and under what circumstances?\nTo answer the ﬁrst question, we build a baseline model,\nwhich learns a completely independent language for each au-\nthor. This model has no shared parameter.\nFrom the experimental results listed in Table 3 we can\nﬁnd that both POS-level information and gated architecture\nmake major contributions to the performance improvement.\nThe baseline model without any parameter sharing performs\nsigniﬁcantly worse than multi-head and gated architecture,\nwhich indicates that it has difﬁculties in learning accurate lan-\nguage model for each author with extremely limited training\ndata. Therefore, a well-designed cross-author parameter shar-\ning is the key to learn more accurate author-speciﬁc language\nmodels by reducing the number of effective parameters.\nAlso, our gated architecture achieves higher accuracy com-\npared to the multi-head when both trained on POS level in-\nputs. This demonstrates that our gated decoder can indeed\ndistinguish the author-speciﬁc writing styles from common\npatterns and learn the common patterns with shared param-\neters. As a result, our model is less prone to overﬁtting and\ncan learn a more accurate language model.\nNot surprisingly, when using the same model architecture,\nthe POS-level language model outperforms the char-level lan-\nguage model by a large margin on the Gutenberg dataset\nbut only achieves moderate performance improvement on the\nPAN-15 dataset. This is due to that the PAN-15 dataset con-\ntains special characters introduced during the process of the\ndataset. Character level models can easily overﬁt these spe-\ncial characters and obtain biased high accuracy.\nIn order to quantitatively compare the importance of the\nauthor-speciﬁc decoder and shared decoder, we calculate the\nmean absolute logits of them respectively. We also calculate\nthe mean value of the gates. The experimental results listed in\nTable 4 demonstrate that the response amplitude of the shared\ndecoder is much larger than the amplitude of the author-\nspeciﬁc decoder on all datasets, which provide evidence to\nfurther support our claim that the model can learn common\nwriting patterns by shared decoder and author-speciﬁc styles\nby stand-alone decoder for each author.\n5 Related Work\nThe authorship veriﬁcation problem is ﬁrst proposed and\nstudied in [Koppel and Schler, 2004 ], and is closely related\nto authorship attribution problem. While being almost solved\non long texts [Bevendorff et al., 2019a], authorship veriﬁca-\ntion is still a challenging task on short texts.\n5.1 Traditional Authorship Veriﬁcation\nThere are numerous authorship veriﬁcation methods attempt-\ning to tackle this problem from different aspects [Stamatatos,\n2009].\nThe very ﬁrst work on authorship veriﬁcation [Koppel and\nSchler, 2004 ] proposed an unmasking method that mainly\nfocused on the analysis of most frequent function words.\nWriteprints [Abbasi and Chen, 2008 ] extract more than\ntwenty stylometric features including lexical, syntactic, and\nstructural text features to conduct authorship analysis.

The distri-\nbution of POS tags can also be utilized to measure the style\ndifferences [Zhao et al., 2006]. Compression is another well-\nstudied path to authorship veriﬁcation which is ﬁrst proposed\nin [Khmelev and Teahan, 2003 ] and recently improved by\n[Halvani et al., 2017].\n5.2 Deep Authorship Analysis\nOnly a few studies have been done on deep authorship veriﬁ-\ncation and deep authorship attribution. In [Bagnall, 2015], a\ncharacter level language model is learned for each author to\ncapture their unique writing styles. Texts will have a higher\nprobability coming from the language model of its true au-\nthor. Recently, several methods use convolution neural net-\nwork to identify the authorship. Their main differences are\nthe formats of the inputs. [Hitschler et al., 2017] ﬁrst trans-\nforms the raw texts into sequences of POS tags, then use a\nconvolution neural network to predict the author.[Shrestha et\nal., 2017] proposes to use character n-gram as the input of the\nconvolution neural network. [Ruder et al., 2016] proposes to\ncombine the char-level input and the word-level input with a\nmulti-channel neural network.\n6 Conclusions\nWe have presented our novel POS-level (Part of Speech)\ngated RNN based language model that can learn the author-\nspeciﬁc syntactic styles with high data efﬁciency. We ﬁrst\npropose to use a POS-level language model to obtain the syn-\ntactic level information. Then we design a novel gated de-\ncoder architecture to improve parameter sharing and enable\ndata-efﬁcient learning of the author-speciﬁc language model.\nExtensive experimental results show that our model outper-\nforms other state-of-the-art competing methods by a large\nmargin in terms of accuracy.\nProceedings of the Twenty-Ninth International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-20)\n4030\nReferences\n[Abbasi and Chen, 2008] Ahmed Abbasi and Hsinchun\nChen.
