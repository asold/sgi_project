    "abstract": "Resumptions are a valuable tool in the analysis and de- sign of semantic models for concurrent programming lan- guages, in which computations consist of sequences of atomic steps that may be interleaved. In this paper we con- sider a general notion of resumption, parameterized by the kind of computations that take place in the atomic steps. We define a monad",
