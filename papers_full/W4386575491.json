  "full_text": "EDITORIAL PERSPECTIVE\nLeveraging ChatGPT to Democratize and Decolonize Global\nSurgery: Large Language Models for Small Healthcare Budgets\nFabio Botelho 1 • Jean Marie Tshimula 1 • Dan Poenaru 1\nAccepted: 18 August 2023 / Published online: 10 September 2023\n/C211The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Socie ´te´ Internationale de Chirurgie 2023\nThe dramatic advancement in generative AI, typiﬁed by the\nuse of large language models for chatbots like ChatGPT,\nhas elicited a swift, often hasty response from the medical\nresearch community. A ﬂurry of editorials, commentaries,\nand preliminary trials on ChatGPT have emerged in spe-\ncialty journals over the past few months. Titles such as\n‘‘ChatGPT: Friend or Foe?’’ [1] and ‘‘Academic Integrity\nand Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Is ChatGPT Hype, Hero, or\nHeresy?’’ [2], epitomize the medical and academic com-\nmunities’ evolving sentiments—from alarm and enthusi-\nasm to a fragile, cautiously optimistic perspective.\nWhile burgeoning literature continues to ask, ‘‘What can\nChatGPT do for us? ’’, little has been written about this\nrevolutionary technology’s potential in advancing global\nsurgery equity by democratizing and decolonizing surgical\ncare. We discuss several ways in which this could be\nachieved in clinical, educational, and research contexts.\nClinical care\nAugmenting doctors knowledge\nGenerative AI chatbots provide valuable information\naccessible anywhere with internet access, offering a cost-\neffective alternative to aid clinicians in their decision-mak-\ning processes. ChatGPT can foster clinical decision support\nsystems encompassing knowledge-based support,\ndiagnostics, and therapy planning [ 3]. This capability\nempowers healthcare providers to develop improved clinical\nguidelines, receive alerts for adverse drug interactions, and\nbeneﬁt from suggestions for diagnosis and therapy planning.\nThese advancements make surgical knowledge accessible\nwithout reliance on costly textbooks and journals or piracy.\nIndeed, the prevalence of illegal article downloads (6 mil-\nlion/month) highlights the limitations of the current pub-\nlishing system, preventing doctors to improve their quality of\ncare [ 4]. Making medical knowledge easily and freely\naccessible is a morally and ethically sound decision, given\nthat it is largely funded by public resources [5].\nAlthough current AI models may not be entirely reliable\nto make clinical decisions without human supervision, our\ngold-standard human decisions are hardly very reliable: 51%\nof scientiﬁc results are inaccurately interpreted by their own\nauthors due to methodological limitations such as subjective\nassessment tools and inappropriate use of analytical tests [6].\nAI has the potential to improve such inaccuracies, and con-\ntribute to more evidence-based decisions and guidelines.\nProviding medical information for patients\nFor patients in Low- and Middle-Income Coun-\ntries (LMICs), AI chatbots can offer personalized educa-\ntional resources in settings where such materials may be\nscarce or challenging to obtain. The ability to generate on-\nthe-ﬂy content in 18 languages, covering 60% of the global\npopulation, is particularly beneﬁcial during the postopera-\ntive period, when follow-up surgical visits may be logis-\ntically and/or economically challenging. While AI chatbots\nlike ChatGPT do not replace standard perioperative surgi-\ncal education, they offer a more reliable alternative of\naddressing patient queries than currently used platforms\nlike Google [ 7].\n& Dan Poenaru\ndan.poenaru@mcgill.ca\n1 Departments of Pediatric Surgery and Surgical and\nInterventional Sciences, McGill University, Montreal,\nCanada\n123\nWorld J Surg (2023) 47:2626–2627\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-023-07167-2\n\nSurgical education\nIn LMICs, access to high-quality educational resources for\nsurgical training can be challenging. Chatbots can generate\nnumerous high-quality multiple-choice and short-answer\nquestions as well as detailed, referenced, model answers,\nand even clinical examination stations with complete stan-\ndardized patient instructions and scoring schemes. They can\nalso create a wide array of multi-lingual clinical simulation\ntraining scenarios with model responses for each step, based\non any given surgical condition or setting [8].\nSurgical research\nEquitable access to academic support for research is typi-\ncally limited in LMICs [ 9]. Researchers frequently lack a\nsupportive research community, experienced colleagues for\nguidance, methodological and statistical support, and are\noften daunted by writing high-quality scientiﬁc manu-\nscripts in a foreign language [ 9]. Chatbots like ChatGPT\ncan assist throughout the research process, from project\nideation to manuscript ﬁne-tuning and correction [ 10].\nOne particular area where ChatGPT can be instrumental is\nin data analysis—by correcting, for instance, code errors in\nstatistical languages like R, and providing guidance on sta-\ntistical methods [ 11]. With its multilingual support, code\ncorrection, and analytical planning capabilities, ChatGPT\nbecomes a powerful resource for researchers, especially in\nresource-limited settings. Empowering surgical investigators\nin LMICs to initiate, conduct, and publish their own studies\ncan effectively disrupt the dominance of HIC authorship and\nthe tokenism still prevalent in global surgical literature [12].\nWarnings and cautions\nNotwithstanding the potential beneﬁts, the world of ChatGPT\nis not without pitfalls. The accuracy of clinical advice, par-\nticularly in clinical diagnosis, remains a challenge. More\nsigniﬁcantly, generative chatbot models may perpetuate the\nbiases embedded in their training data, inadvertently sus-\ntaining a legacy of inequity and oppression. Clinicians and\ndata scientists must exercise discernment and intentionality to\navoid propagating biased data and foster ethically fair models.\nFinal considerations\nThe use of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has the potential\nto democratize and decolonize surgical care, beneﬁting\npatients and surgeons, by addressing equity challenges in\nclinical care, education, and research. It is important,\nhowever, to recognize that the true power of chatbots lies\nin their role as assistants to surgical care providers, rather\nthan replacing them. Human expertise reduces the likeli-\nhood of errors in AI algorithms through meticulous review\nand prompt guidance [ 3]. It is essential to view AI as a\nmeans to amplify human skills rather than replace them,\nresulting in augmented humans [ 13]. This collaborative\nsynergy between human expertise and AI assistance can\ntransform chatbots into reliable and efﬁcient partners,\noptimizing surgeons’ valuable time and work.\nReferences\n1.
