I would like to demonstrate the performance of LLMs \nin answering sample questions from the clinical radiology \nphase 2 exam of the Royal Australian and New Zealand Col-\nlege of Radiologists (RANZCR).\nVarious LLM algorithms have started to gain ground in \nassisting radiologists, in medical education, and in research \n[2]. Among these models, the generative pre-trained trans-\nformer 4 (GPT-4) has shown notable performance in the \nradiology board exam [3 ]. Although GPT-3.5 and Google \nGemini provide text-based output to text-based inputs, \nGPT-4 can give text-based output to both text and image-\nbased inputs. The exam comprised 7 single-answer multi -\nple-choice questions and 7 short-answer questions related to \npathology, in addition to 11 single-answer multiple-choice \nquestions focused on radiology, all of which were text-based \nquestions. In addition, there were 2 single-answer pictorial \nmultiple choice questions and 9 short cases requiring a sin-\ngle likely diagnosis as medical image-containing questions \n(https:// www. ranzcr. com/ colle ge/ docum ent- libra ry/ clini cal- \nradio logy- phase-2- 2023- exami nation- sample- quest ions). \nGPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Google Gemini achieved accuracy \nrates in pathology multiple-choice questions (100%, 85.7%, \n85.7%), short answer questions (82.1%, 81%, 69%), and \nradiology multiple-choice questions (81.8%, 27.2%, 27.2%), \nrespectively. GPT-4 outperformed the other LLM models. \nIn the medical image-containing part, GPT-4 achieved 50% \naccuracy in pictorial multiple-choice questions and 44.4% in \nshort cases. Although GPT-4 shows effective performance \nin written lower-order and higher-order questions, it is still \nat the beginning stages in medical image-based questions. \nStudying the effectiveness of LLM models in full-text \nboard exams would be beneficial. LLM models can be the \nsubject of future research for clinical decision support for \nradiologists.\nFunding No funds, grants, or other support was received.\nDeclarations \nConflict of interest The author has no relevant financial or non-finan-\ncial interests to disclose.\nReferences\n 1.
