The series is intended\nto help such people ensure that their decisions are well-informed\nby the best available research evidence. The SUPPORT tools\nand the ways in which they can be used are described in more\ndetail in the Introduction to this series [1]. A glossary for the\nentire series is attached to each article (see Additional File 1).\nLinks to Spanish, Portuguese, French and Chinese translations\nof this series can be found on the SUPPORT website (http://\nwww.support-collaboration.org). Feedback about how to\nimprove the tools in this series is welcome and should be sent to:\nSTP@nokc.no.\nScenarios\nScenario 1: You are a senior civil servant and have been asked\nto submit a briefing note to the Minister about a health system\nproblem in which she has a personal interest, namely that many\nof her constituents and family members say that they can’t find\na primary healthcare physician. You are concerned about\nwhether the current draft of the briefing note prepared by a jun-\nior policy analyst does justice to the problem.\nScenario 2: You work in the Ministry of Health and are prepar-\ning a briefing note about a health system problem. All that you\nhave been told is that the problem is about many citizens not\nhaving access to primary healthcare providers and services.\nScenario 3: You work in an independent unit that supports the\nMinistry of Health in its use of research evidence in policymak-\ning and are preparing a policy brief for the Ministry of Health\non barriers to accessing primary healthcare. You want guidance\non how to clarify the problem in a systematic and comprehen-\nsive way.\nBackground\nFor policymakers (Scenario 1), this article suggests a\nnumber of questions that they might ask their staff to con-\nsider when preparing a briefing note about a problem. For\nthose who support policymakers (Scenarios 2 and 3), this\narticle suggests a number of questions to guide the clarifi-\ncation of a problem based on the best available local and\nglobal evidence. This article is the first of three articles\nabout clarifying evidence needs (see also Articles 5 and 6\n[2,3]). Figure 1 outlines the processes involved in clarify-\ning these needs.\nPolicymakers and those supporting them often find them-\nselves in situations in which they need to decide how best\nto define a problem. They may have:\n• Identified a problem through an explicit priority-set-\nting process (the focus of Article 3) [4]\n Read about a problem in a report from a national\nstatistical agency or from an independent researcher\n Been asked a tough question about a problem in the\nlegislature or by someone living in their constituency\n Found a problem highlighted on the front page of a\ndaily newspaper, or\n Identified a problem through their personal experi-\nence of a health system\nSome of these situations lend themselves to the proactive\nassessment of a problem, or what some might call an issue\nor challenge. But most typically they place policymakers\nin a reactive mode.\nThe motivation for policymakers to clarify a problem may\nbe informed by a consideration of:\n Whether to pay serious attention to a particular\nproblem that others assert is important\n What factors contribute to a problem\n How to measure the magnitude of a problem\n(whether it is getting better or worse, and whether it is\nresponding to particular policies or programmes)\n How to convince others to agree that a problem is\nimportant (or that a favoured way forward is the opti-\nmal one given how it addresses a particular problem),\nor\n How to address misperceptions or manage expecta-\ntions among those who (erroneously, in the eyes of\nthe policymakers) see the problem as important\nDebates and struggles over how to define a problem are a\ncritically important part of the policymaking process\n[5,6]. The outcome of these debates and struggles will\ninfluence whether (and, in part, how) policymakers take\naction to address a problem.\nProblems may come to light through:\n A focusing event\n A change in an indicator, or\n Feedback from the operation of a current policy or\nprogramme [7]\nFocusing events are very common in the health sector\nbecause poor decision making may lead to extreme and\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S4 http://www.health-pol icy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S4\nPage 3 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\noften high-profile events such as illness and death. An\nexample of a focusing event would be extensive newspa-\nper coverage over a number of consecutive days of the pro-\nvision of counterfeit prescription drugs and the deaths\nresulting from their use. A change in an indicator, though\nless dramatic, can also bring a problem to attention, par-\nticularly if it is a large change or it receives significant\nattention in a report or media release. A national statistical\nagency, for instance, may release a report that shows that\nnurses’ pay varies widely across a country and that this is\ncontributing to nursing shortages in certain provinces. Or\na problem may come to light through feedback from the\noperation of a current policy or programme. Informal\nfeedback from a programme manager in charge of a pro-\nvincial waiting-time reduction initiative might, for exam-\nple, highlight the fact that the programme is failing to\nmeet its target for wait-time reductions due to resource\nlimitations.\nHowever, not all problems that are brought to attention\nare deemed worthy of government action. A problem can\nbe defined as warranting government action by:\n Comparing current conditions with values related to\na ‘more ideal’ state of affairs\n Comparing performance with other jurisdictions,\nand\n Framing a subject in a different way (e.g. describing\na problem as an impediment to achieve a national pri-\nority) [7]\nPoliticians from different political parties will reflect dif-\nferent values and interpretations related to what consti-\ntutes a ‘more ideal’ state of affairs. A Minister of Health\nmight regard the performance of their own country’s\nhealth system favourably relative to another in a neigh-\nbouring country. But he or she might not do so when it is\ncompared less favourably to other but equally appropriate\ninternational examples. Similarly, a cabinet may decide to\ntake action if a particular problem is defined in terms of a\nlack of patient choice among healthcare providers (given\nthat this could potentially become a source of frustration\nfor voters), but not if a problem is defined in terms of a\nClarifying evidence needsFigure 1\n5PQZ`UReUZS\u0016ZQQP_\u0016R[^\u0016\n^Q_QM^OT\u0016QbUPQZOQ\n/XM^URe\u0016M\u0016\\^[NXQY\n5Y\\XQYQZ`\u0016MZ\u0016[\\`U[Z\n2^MYQ\u0016[\\`U[Z_\u0016`[\u0016MPP^Q__\u0016M\u0016\\^[NXQY\u0016\n\u001eMZP\u0016PQ_O^UNQ\u0016QMOT\u0016[\\`U[Z_\u0016O[_`_\u0016\nMZP\u0016O[Z_Q]aQZOQ_\u001f\n;\\`U[Z\u0016ó\np\u0016\u0016.QZQRU`_\np\u0016\u00164M^Y_\np\u0016\u0016/[_`_%O[_`#\n\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016QRRQO`UbQZQ__\n;\\`U[Z\u0016ô\np\u0016\u0016.QZQRU`_\np\u0016\u00164M^Y_\np\u0016\u0016/[_`_%O[_`#\n\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016QRRQO`UbQZQ__\n;\\`U[Z\u0016õ\np\u0016\u0016.QZQRU`_\np\u0016\u00164M^Y_\np\u0016\u0016/[_`_%O[_`#\n\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016QRRQO`UbQZQ__\nPP\n\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S4 http://www.health-pol icy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S4\nPage 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nlack of interest on the part of physicians in joining clinics\nthat use collaborative practice models (this issue might be\nperceived by them as being too far removed from the con-\ncerns of voters).\nEfforts to clarify problems are more likely to result in\naction if they:\n Reflect an awareness of concurrent developments\nrelated to policy and programme options (e.g. the\npublication of a report demonstrating the effective-\nness of a particular option), and\n Are influenced by concurrent political events (such\nas the appointment of a new Minister of Health who\nmay have a personal interest in a particular issue) [7]\nIf a problem is not defined in a way that ‘fits well’ with\nwhat are perceived to be viable options, or if it does not fit\nwith broader political events, it is very unlikely to reach a\ndecision agenda. An option can be deemed to be a viable\nsolution if it is technically feasible, fits with dominant val-\nues and the public’s current mood, and is acceptable both\nin terms of budget workability and likely political support\nor opposition [7]. Relevant political events can include\nswings in the public mood, changes in levels of support or\nopposition from interest groups, and changes to the gov-\nerning party or prevailing legislative coalition [7].\nQuestions to consider\nThe following questions can guide how to identify a prob-\nlem and characterise its features:\n1. What is the problem?\n2. How did the problem come to attention and has\nthis process influenced the prospect of it being\naddressed?\n3. What indicators can be used or collected to establish\nthe magnitude of the problem and to measure\nprogress in addressing it?\n4. What comparisons can be made to establish the\nmagnitude of the problem and to measure progress in\naddressing it?\n5. How can a problem be framed (or described) in a\nway that will motivate different groups?\n1. What is the problem?\nA problem may relate to one or more of the following:\n A risk factor, disease or condition\n The programmes, services or drugs currently being\nused to address a risk factor, disease or condition\n The current health system arrangements within\nwhich programmes, services and drugs are provided,\nor\n The current degree of implementation of an agreed\nupon course of action (e.g. a policy or guideline)\nThe prevalence of a risk factor or the burden of a disease\nor condition in a province or country (e.g. incidence rate,\nprevalence rate, mortality rate) may constitute a problem.\nBut more often, such issues are the manifestation of a\nproblem: their cause is the real problem that needs to be\naddressed. The problem may instead lie with the pro-\ngramme or service, or relate specifically to the suitability\nof a drug that is currently being used to address a risk fac-\ntor, disease or condition. Ineffective programmes, services\nor drugs may, for example, be in use to prevent or treat the\nrisk factor, disease or condition.\nAlternatively, a problem may be rooted in current health\nsystem arrangements within which programmes, services\nand drugs are provided. Potential problems may lie with\ngovernance arrangements/structures. These can include:\n Who has policy (e.g. regulatory), organisational,\ncommercial and professional authority and accounta-\nbility over particular programmes\n The services and drugs or the parts of the health sys-\ntem within which the programmes are located\n The services and drugs provided\n How authority is discharged, and\n How people who exercise authority are held\naccountable\nPotential problems may also be rooted in financial\narrangements. Such arrangements may affect who\nfinances (i.e. who pays for) particular programmes, serv-\nices and drugs and the parts of the health system within\nwhich these are provided, or how organisations are\nfunded to deliver them. It may also relate to how profes-\nsionals are remunerated to provide programmes, services\nor drugs, whether patients/consumers are offered incen-\ntives to use them, and how resources are allocated to\nthem. Further, problems may be linked to current delivery\narrangements. These may include: who is targeted by par-\nticular programmes, services and drugs, who they reach\n(or who accesses and uses them), who provides them and\nhow, where they are they provided, what information and\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S4 http://www.health-pol icy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S4\nPage 5 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ncommunication technology is used to provided them, and\nwhat safety and quality systems are provided. The taxon-\nomy of governance, financial and delivery arrangements is\naddressed further in Article 7 in this series [8].\nFinally, a problem may be rooted in the degree of imple-\nmentation of an agreed course of action about a pro-\ngramme, service or drug, or else an agreed course of action\nabout the health system arrangements within which these\nare provided. A problem, for example, may already have\nbeen defined and a policy introduced to address it, but the\npolicy may not yet have been translated into action. In\nthis instance, one approach to identifying the problem is\nto identify potential barriers to implementation at one or\nmore of four levels:\n1. The healthcare recipient and citizen level (e.g. citi-\nzens are unaware that they can access a programme,\nservice or drug free of charge)\n2. The healthcare provider level (e.g. health workers\ndo not fully adhere to national policies and guide-\nlines)\n3. The organisational level (e.g. organisations do not\nmanage the performance of their staff), and\n4. The system level (e.g. policies are not enforced).\nThe identification of barriers to implementation is the\nfocus of Article 6 in this series [3].\nTable 1: Clarifying the problem underpinning the lack of widespread use of the recommended malaria treatment\nMembers of the Evidence-Informed Policy Networks (EVIPNet) in ten sub-Saharan African countries identified the problem of the lack of \nwidespread use of the recommended artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to treat malaria in their respective countries. The following \nframework of four questions (and relevant sources of data and research evidence) [11] was used to clarify this problem:\n• Does the problem relate to a risk factor, disease or condition?\n Incidence of (and death rates from) uncomplicated falciparum malaria, by age (including separately for infants), sex (including separately for \npregnant women and lactating women), HIV status, malnutrition status, and socio-economic status\n• Does the problem relate to a programme, service or drug currently being used to address a risk factor, disease or condition?\n Cure rates for, and drug resistance (or reduced drug sensitivity) to, ACT and other anti-malarial drugs, as well as the side effects and costs \nof the drugs\n The views and experiences of patients about particular anti-malarial drugs\n• Does the problem relate to the current health system arrangements within which programmes, services and drugs are provided?\n Governance arrangements\n– Regulations about which ACT and other anti -malarial drugs (i.e. drugs, dosage regimes, and packaging) can be registered/licensed for \nsale, how counterfeit or substandard drugs are safeguarded against, how patents for them and profits arising from them are handled, how \nthey can be marketed, who can prescribe them and how, and who can sell or dispense them and how\n– National treatment guidelines an d/or the national malaria control policy about the first-line (and second-line) drug therapy \nrecommended for uncomplicated falciparum malaria, as well as their dosage regimes/packaging, targeting for particular populations, and \ntargeting for areas with particular characteristics\n– National essential drugs list, particu larly the list of anti-malarial drugs\n Financial arrangements\n– Drug and dispensing fees for first-line dr ug therapy (and for ACT if this is not the first-line therapy) for uncomplicated falciparum \nmalaria, including any subsidies for particular populations, remuneration arrangements for health works prescribing and dispensing ACT\n– The views and experiences of patients about fees and su bsidies and about financial incentives to promote adherence\n Delivery arrangements\n– Access rates for first-line drug therapy \n(and for ACT if this is not first-line therapy) for uncomplicated falciparum malaria (i.e. who has access to someone who can dispense drug \ntherapy)\n– Coverage rates for first-line drug therapy \n(and for ACT if this is not first-line therapy) for uncomplicated falciparum malaria (i.e. who is dispensed which drug)\n– Treatment patterns for unc omplicated falciparum malaria \n(i.e. who dispenses what, when, where and how, including whether treatment is part of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness or \nother ‘horizontal’ programmes)\n– Adherence patterns for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria (i.e. who takes what, when, where and how)\n– Arrangements for surveillance, ph armacovigilance and the diagnosis and treatment of atypical cases\n– The views and experiences of pati ents about particular providers (or delivery arrangements more generally)\n• Does the problem relate to the current degree of implementation of an agreed-upon course of action?\n For example, regulations can only help to address a problem if they are acted upon throughout the health system. Regulations may exist \nabout the registration/licensure, marketing, prescribing and dispending of ACT and other anti-malarial drugs. However, if the regulations are not \nenforced, there may be many counterfeit or substandard drugs in circulation, false statements may be made in drug advertisements, and \nuntrained individuals may be prescribing or dispending ACT\nThe EVIPNet teams all concluded that the problem could be related to a risk factor, disease or condition, the programmes, services or drugs \ncurrently being used, the current health system arrangements and, in some cases, the current degree of implementation of an agreed-upon course \nof action. This had important implications for which options were considered appropriate to address this multi-faceted problem.\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S4 http://www.health-pol icy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S4\nPage 6 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPolicymakers and those who support them need to deter-\nmine the causes of a problem. These problems may be\nrelated to: one or more of a risk factors; a disease or con-\ndition; the programmes, services or drugs currently being\nused; the current health system arrangements; or the cur-\nrent degree of implementation of an agreed upon course\nof action. Doing so can be an iterative process. What at\nfirst glance may appear to be a seemingly unrelated issue,\nsuch as disincentives to manage chronic disease proac-\ntively in primary healthcare, may actually be the very\nproblem that needs attention. Table 1 illustrates how this\nsimple framework can be used to clarify a problem, using\nmalaria treatment in sub-Saharan Africa as an example.\nPolicymakers and those supporting them could gain addi-\ntional insights into this component of problem clarifica-\ntion from the fields of complexity theory, complex\nadaptive systems, and soft systems methodology. Exam-\nples of relevant resources are provided at the end of this\narticle.\n2. How did the problem come to attention and has this \nprocess influenced the prospect of it being addressed?\nIdentifying a problem is often only the beginning of the\nprocess. Typically, a great deal of work will still need to be\ndone in order to clarify a problem in a way that confirms\nwhether or not there is a need to address it. If there is a\nneed, it will also be necessary to build the support\nrequired to address it. Understanding how a problem first\ncame to attention can be an important initial step in the\nprocess of clarification. As outlined in the Background sec-\ntion in this article, problems typically come to light\nthrough:\n A focusing event\n A change in an indicator, or\n Feedback from the operation of current policies and\nprogrammes\nTable 2: Clarifying the problem underpinning high rates of medication error\nQuestions 2-5 which were discussed earlier in this article can be used to clarify a problem once it has been related to one or more of the following: \na risk factor, disease or condition, the programmes, services or drugs currently being used, the current health system arrangements and the current \ndegree of implementation of an agreed upon course of action. Consider the following example of the problem of high rates of medication error:\n• How did the problem come to attention and has this process influenced the prospect of it being addressed?\n The problem of medical error may come to attention through a focusing event (e.g. a child dies because a doctor prescribes the wrong \ndrug dosage), a change in an indicator (e.g. there is a dramatic increase in the number of reported errors in a given month) or feedback from the \noperation of current policies and programmes \n(e.g. an evaluation report identifies more types of medication errors than have been routinely measured)\n An evaluation report may identify that one possible factor contributing to a problem is the lack of clear boundaries of the scope of practice \nbetween doctors, nurses and pharmacists, which makes accountability for prescribing, dispensing, administration and chart documentation \nunclear\n The same report may propose that the problem be turned into a statement of purpose that can be used to engage a diverse array of \nstakeholders. For example, policymakers may prefer to speak about how their country will become a leader in patient safety, rather than \nreferring to current patient safety problems\n• What indicators can be used or collected to establish the magnitude of the problem and to measure progress in addressing it?\n Policymakers may identify that no indicators are currently being measured accurately at the national level but that they are interested in \nstarting to accurately measure both the number of medication error reports per quarter and the number of ‘near misses’ per quarter. Collecting \nsuch data would allow them to set a target level for the indicator\n• What comparisons can be made in order to establish the magnitude of the problem and to measure progress in addressing it?\n Policymakers may identify that they would like to make four types of comparisons:\n– Comparisons over time within the country\n– Comparisons to other appropriate comparator countries\n– Comparisons against a target to be set as part of a national patient safety strategy\n– Comparisons against what a national consumer association has said it would like to see\n Ideally a search for administrative database studies or community surveys would allow the policymakers to identify at least some existing \nresearch evidence and allow them to make immediate comparisons\n• How can a problem be framed (or described) in a way that will motivate different groups?\n Policymakers may find that:\n– Pharmacists respond to the language used to describe a medication error\n– Consumer groups respond to a stated purpose of achieving, for example, a 50% reduction in medication errors\n– Regulators engage when the lack of clear boundaries between th e scope of practice of healthcare providers is discussed as an \nimportant feature of the problem\n– Hospital staff may respond posit ively when told of a plan to collect an indicator that identifies under-reporting in a way does not \npenalise units or departments who support full disclosure\n– Hospital executives may engage most fully wh en comparisons are made among their facilities\n Ideally a search for qualitative studies would allow the policymakers to grasp the different meanings that different groups attach to a \nproblem \nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S4 http://www.health-pol icy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S4\nPage 7 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nKey policymakers may (or may not) agree whether a prob-\nlem warrants attention at the early stages of the problem-\nclarification process. Table 2 illustrates how the question\ndiscussed here in this sub-section (together with three\nadditional questions) can be used to clarify a problem\nonce it has been related to one or more of: a risk factor,\ndisease or condition; the programmes, services or drugs\ncurrently being used; the current health system arrange-\nments; or the current degree of implementation of an\nagreed upon course of action.\nIf key policymakers do agree that a problem warrants\nattention and that they want to stake out a claim for what\nthey would like to achieve in addressing the problem (e.g.\nthrough a statement of purpose or a goal), this will often\nleave little time to clarify the problem accurately. Before\nlong, it may be necessary to move on to the specifics of\nconsidering how the options should be framed.\nIt is possible though that a focusing event could, on closer\nexamination, turn out to be a significant aberration rather\nthan reflecting a widespread problem. Similarly, an indi-\ncator may be found to have been poorly measured or not\nadjusted for seasonal variation. Or an internal report\nabout the operation of current policies and programmes\nmay, when read more closely, contain significant errors of\ninterpretation. It may also be the case that policymakers\nerroneously link a problem to programmes, services or\ndrugs currently being used when, in reality, the actual\nproblem may lie elsewhere.\nAlternatively, key policymakers may quickly decide that a\nproblem does not warrant attention. They may focus on\naddressing misperceptions or managing expectations\namong those who first brought the problem to attention.\nIn the interim, those supporting such policymakers may\nconduct a preliminary review and conclude that the prob-\nlem is significant. In this case key policymakers will be left\nwith the difficult task of having to make an argument for\nre-opening an issue that has been effectively closed – per-\nhaps even in a highly visible way.\n3. What indicators can be used or collected to establish the \nmagnitude of the problem and to measure progress in \naddressing it?\nDepending on how a problem first comes to attention, it\nmay or may not be necessary to examine closely which\nindicators related to a problem are currently being meas-\nured (or can and should be measured) accurately. If, for\nexample, a problem comes to attention through a change\nin an indicator that is already known to be highly reliable,\ngiving further attention to other indicators may not be\nneeded. On the other hand, if a problem comes to atten-\ntion through a focusing event, further work would be nec-\nessary. In such cases:\n Community surveys and vital registries are examples\nof good sources of indicators about a risk factor, dis-\nease or condition\n Healthcare administrative data (or what are some-\ntimes called health management information sys-\ntems), monitoring and evaluation data, community\nsurveys, and healthcare provider surveys can be good\nsources of indicators about the programmes, services\nand drugs currently being used\n Legislation, regulation, policies, drug formularies,\nand policymaker surveys can be good sources of indi-\ncators about governance arrangements\n Health expenditure surveys and healthcare provider\nsurveys can be good sources of indicators about finan-\ncial arrangements\n Healthcare administrative data can be good sources\nof indicators about delivery arrangements, and\n Community surveys and healthcare provider sur-\nveys, as well as healthcare administrative data, can be\ngood sources of indicators about the current degree of\nimplementation of an agreed upon course of action\nDisaggregated data, such as data by ethnicity/culture, gen-\nder or socio-economic status, can often be particularly\nhelpful in clarifying whether a problem is widespread or\nparticularly pronounced in some groups. Article 11 in this\nseries addresses how to find and use local evidence, and\nArticle 10 describes a categorisation scheme for groups\nwhich could be considered when incorporating equity-\nbased approaches within the process of problem clarifica-\ntion [9,10].\n4. What comparisons can be made to establish the \nmagnitude of the problem and to measure progress in \naddressing it?\nWhile indicators can provide policymakers with some\nsense of the magnitude of a particular problem, implicit\nor explicit comparisons are what truly establish whether a\nproblem is big or small, whether it is getting better or\nworse, or whether it appears amenable to change. At least\nfour key types of comparisons can be made:\n  Comparisons over time within a country : can help to\nestablish whether a problem is getting better or worse.\nIf corrective actions have already been taken, such\ncomparisons can help to determine whether a prob-\nlem appears amenable to change\n  Comparisons between countries and other appropriate\ncomparators (where the data are comparable): can help\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S4 http://www.health-pol icy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S4\nPage 8 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nto establish whether a problem is big or small and\nwhat targets could be achievable, and help to mobilise\nsupport for addressing a problem\n  Comparisons against plans: (e.g. national targets and\nthe Millennium Development Goals) can help to\nmobilise support for addressing a problem, and\n  Comparisons against what policymakers and/or stake-\nholders predicted or wanted : can also help to mobilise\nsupport for reaching goals\nWhile clarifying a problem relies extensively on local data,\nresearch evidence can often provide comparisons that\nhave been conducted in a systematic and transparent way.\nHealthcare administrative database studies and commu-\nnity surveys, for example, which are often published in\nresearch literature, can help to clarify a problem and\nappropriate targets and mobilise support. Such studies\ncan be highly useful to policymakers in addressing mis-\nperceptions or managing expectations. They can also be\nused to develop or refine a statement of purpose. For\nexample, policymakers may want to change the trajectory\nof an existing indicator or measure a new indicator in\nways that permit comparisons. Article 11 in this series\nprovides approaches to finding and using local evidence\n[9]. Table 3 also provides tips for finding healthcare\nadministrative database studies and community surveys.\n5. How can a problem be framed (or described) in a way \nthat will motivate different groups?\nHow a given problem is categorised can have important\nconsequences for the way groups may respond. Framing a\nproblem in new or alternative ways is likely to result in the\nissues resonating in different ways among different\ngroups. Canada, for example, has framed the field of study\nrelated to the social determinants of health most neutrally\nby referring to it as ‘population health’. In contrast, in the\nUnited States, the same field is often referred to as ‘dispar-\nities in health’ – a term that conveys the existence of dif-\nferences but not necessarily unfairness. In the United\nKingdom, the term ‘inequalities in health’ is commonly\nused. This term seems explicitly to convey unfairness, and\nit only gained political traction when a new governing\nparty was elected in the 1990s with a goal of reducing\nunfairness within health and other sectors. Some groups\nmay respond more actively to a negatively framed prob-\nlem statement (e.g. “Our country has the highest infant\nmortality rate in the region”) while others may respond\nbetter to a positively framed statement of purpose (e.g.\n“Our country will, within five years, achieve the national\nhealth goals related to infant mortality”).\nSome groups may rally around issues related to a particu-\nlar disease or condition (e.g. rapidly rising rates of cardio-\nvascular disease). Others may rally around one or more\nrisk factors (e.g. smoking, diet, exercise or housing and\nworking conditions). Even groups with a similar focus\nmay be attracted to different indicators related to the same\nproblem. Some may be motivated more by ‘hard’ indica-\ntors such as mortality. But others may be motivated by\nTable 3: Finding research evidence about a problem\nWhile much of the task of problem clarification involves finding and using local evidence (the subject of Article 11 in this series), published \nadministrative database studies and community surveys can provide insights about comparisons [9]. Qualitative studies can also provide insight into \nalternative framings for a problem.\nThe first set of steps involved in finding such studies includes:\n• Drawing up a list of words or phrases that capture the problem (e.g. medication error, scope of practice), synonyms for each problem and factor \n(e.g. drug near-misses, professional regulation), and alternative spellings for each synonym (e.g. medication, medications)\n• Deciding whether systematic reviews (the subject of Article 7) or single research studies are the focus of the search [8], and\n• Providing any additional details that limit the search (e.g. children, adults)\nThe second set of steps includes:\n• Choosing those words and phrases that would all need to be present in order for the article to be identified (e.g. medication error, systematic \nreview, and children), connecting them with ‘and’, and putting them in brackets, and\n• Choosing those words and phrases for which only one would need to be present (e.g. medical error and its synonyms), connecting them with ‘or’, \nand putting them in brackets, and\n• Connecting both sets of brackets using ‘and’\nThe third set of steps includes:\n• Using the Internet to access the health-related database, PubMed. This database contains a ‘hedge’ (i.e. a validated search strategy or filter) for the \ntypes of studies of interest here [12]\n• Clicking on ‘special queries’ in the left task bar\n• Clicking on ‘health services research’ queries\n• Entering the words and phrases, as well as the Boolean operators (‘and’/‘or’) in the search field, and\n• Clicking ‘process assessment’ or ‘outcomes assessment’ for administrative database studies and ‘qualitative research’ for qualitative studies\nThis approach increases the chances that the returned citations will be of the appropriate study type, though many other types of studies may be \nretrieved as well.\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S4 http://www.health-pol icy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S4\nPage 9 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n‘soft’ indicators such as self-reported health status. Partic-\nular groups may be motivated only by indicators from the\nhealth sector, such as health-related quality of life. Other\ngroups, in contrast, may be motivated by indicators from\nnon-health sectors that can have an influence on health\nand healthcare, such as employment status. The impor-\ntance of comparisons can also vary by group, with some\ngroups more interested in a narrowly defined group of\npeers that share a range of key characteristics (such as large\nuniversity-affiliated teaching hospitals), and others more\ninterested in the full spectrum of organisations providing\nsimilar types of healthcare (such as all hospitals).\nQualitative research can shed light on the meanings that\nindividuals or groups attach to a particular problem, the\nindicators used to measure it, and the comparisons made\nto establish its importance. Table 3 provides tips for find-\ning this type of research. Conversations with different\ngroups and available qualitative research can help policy-\nmakers identify which framings of a problem (or pur-\npose) can best mobilise support among different groups\nto address a problem. A key challenge, however, is ensur-\ning that the alternative framings being considered are con-\nsistent with the problem, as determined through the type\nof systematic analysis described above.\nConclusion\nProblem clarification can all too easily be skipped over\nentirely, or else done too rapidly, or in too cursory a way.\nIt may also not be done iteratively when additional data\nand research evidence are found regarding indicators and\ncomparisons, or when policies and programmes encoun-\nter challenges or fail to yield results. Any such failures in\nproblem clarification may mean that further resource\ninvestments based on existing conceptions of a problem\nwill be misguided. Close attention should be paid there-\nfore to indicators, comparisons and alternative framings\nto ensure that decisions about which particular problem\nto focus on are well-informed. The process of clarifying a\nproblem will influence decisions about which particular\noptions warrant serious consideration based on how they\naddress a problem.\nResources\nUseful documents and further reading\n- Kingdon JW: Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policies,\n2 edn.
