Here we show that these directions always commute, ident ify\nwhen the Killing spinors are charged, and show that both their inner\nproduct and resulting geometry are governed by two fundamenta l con-\nstants. In particular, setting one constant to zero leads to AdS7 × S4,\nsetting the other to zero gives AdS4 × S7, while ﬂat spacetime is re-\ncovered when both these constants are zero. Furthermore, wh en the\nconstants are equal, the spacetime is either LLM, or it correspond s to\nthe Kowalski-Glikman solution where the constants are simply the mas s\nparameter.\n1 Introduction\nGiven a supersymmetric solution with an anti-de Sitter ( AdS) factor in D = 11\nsupergravity, it is expected that a corresponding superconform al ﬁeld theory (SCFT)\nexists [1]. Beyond the near-horizon of M2 and M5-branes, one way t o get more\nintricate geometries is to consider wrapped branes. In the past, e xplicit solutions\nof this nature have been constructed in lower-dimensional gauged supergravities\n[2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and subsequent eﬀorts have been made directly in high er-dimensions\nto characterise large classes of AdS geometries by employing wrapped brane ans¨ atze\n[7, 8, 9]. While the latter oﬀers greater generality, primarily because one is not\nconﬁned to a particular dimensional reduction, a recognised advan tage of working in\nlower-dimensions is that it is easier to construct explicit solutions. A n otable recent\nexample is a new class of four-dimensional N = 1 SCFT [10, 11] duals generalising\n[2]1.\nMore generally still, it is possible to discard wrapped brane intuition com pletely\nand embrace powerful Killing spinor techniques in higher-dimensions [1 3, 14]. In the\nprocess the Killing spinor equations (KSE) are converted into diﬀere ntial conditions\non spinor bilinears (diﬀerential forms) which characterise the spac etime. In D =\n11 this approach has been applied widely [15, 16, 17, 18, 19], but two p rominent\nexamples concern geometries dual to four-dimensional N = 1 [20] and N = 2\nSCFTs [21]. The beauty here is that the expected SO(4,2) conformal symmetry\ngets encoded in the AdS5 factor, while the key distinction between N = 1 and\nN = 2 depends on the presence of a two-sphere encoding the SU(2) R-symmetry\ngeometrically. Up to warpings, these ans¨ atze are extremely gene ral and an added\nbonus is that, in each case, a U(1) R-symmetry emerges for free form the KSE\nanalysis.\nQuotients of AdS5 × S5 aside [22], all known solutions corresponding to N = 2\nSCFT dual geometries can be traced to the Lin, Lunin, Maldacena (L LM) class of\ngeometries [21], earning it a billing as the most general class of geomet ries dual to\nN = 2 SCFTs. The generality of the LLM geometries has recently been s trengthened\nby the observation [23] that a missing four-form ﬂux in the analysis of LLM is\ninconsistent with supersymmetry. Given their uniqueness, the LLM geometries serve\nas an important basis for subsequent studies. In particular, the g ravity duals of a\nlarge class of N = 2 generalised quiver gauge theories [24] were identiﬁed and\nanalysed by Gaiotto and Maldacena [25]. As discussed in [25], since solu tions to\n1See [12] for a recent discussion on the construction of solutions in h igher-dimensions highlight-\ning some associated diﬃculties.\n1\nthe LLM class of geometries are in one-to-one correspondence wit h solutions to the\ncontinuum Toda equation, the task of ﬁnding solutions can be simpliﬁe d greatly by\nthe introduction of a global U(1) and reduction to type IIA supergravity, a setting\nwhere the Toda equation is replaced by an easier to solve Laplace equ ation. This\nsimpliﬁcation has facilitated recent solutions [26, 27].\nIt is also worth bearing in mind that recent developments in our under standing\nof N = 2 gauge theories mean that geometric insights are not solely conﬁn ed to\nsupergravity solutions. By using localization, the S4 partition function of N = 2\ngauge theories can be reduced to a ﬁnite-dimensional matrix integr al [28], allowing\none to study the free energy [29] and circular Wilson loops [30, 31, 32 , 33] at strong\ncoupling in the large- N limit. Current ﬁndings are in agreement with the sugges-\ntion in [34] that the dual theory may be sub-critical with only seven “ geometric”\ndimensions comprising an AdS5 and S1 factor. This appears consistent with a recent\nsearch for smooth AdS5 × S2 geometries in type IIB supergravity, which concludes\nthat the SU(2) R-symmetry must be non-geometric [35].\nAgainst this background, in this paper we take the LLM ansatz in D = 11 to\nits logical conclusion. Recall that LLM [21] initially introduced a genera l Killing\nspinor ansatz only to truncate it once a ﬂux term along the internal spacetime\nwas removed. While it was subsequently shown that there are no sup ersymmetric\nAdS5 × S2 geometries in D= 11 supported by this omitted ﬂux [23], an unexpected\nby-product was the emergence of an extra Killing direction beyond t he expected\nSU(2) × U(1) R-symmetry. Although LLM can be recovered by identifying the two\nKilling directions [23], more generally it is valid to ask if either of them can p lay a\nrˆ ole as a global U(1) such as in [25].\nSo, in this paper we tidy up a loose-end in [23], by treating these two Killin g\ndirections independently. Following a review in the next section, in sec tion 3.1 we\nshow that the Killing vectors always commute, while their inner produc t is propor-\ntional to the product of two fundamental constant scalar bilinears. We calculate the\nnorm of the vectors and observe that when the two fundamental constants are equal\nthat one either has LLM or a spacetime with a null Killing vector. Indee d, it is in\nthis case that we note in 3.2 that it is always possible to ﬁnd a linear comb ination\nso that the Killing spinors are independent of this direction. Later in s ection 5 we\nconﬁrm that this null spacetime is indeed the maximally supersymmetr ic pp-wave\nin D= 11.\nMore generally, when the two constants diﬀer, an extreme case of which is when\none of them is zero, we see that the Killing spinors are always charged with respect\nto both directions indicating that supersymmetry must be double th at of LLM.\n2\nIt is then well-known [36] that AdS4 × S7, AdS7 × S4 and ﬂat spacetime are the\nonly timelike possibilities. A noticeable caveat here is that the Killing spino rs are\nuncharged for ﬂat spacetime, so to ﬁll this gap in the argument, in s ection 4.1\nwe determine the Killing spinors and the geometry by integrating the d iﬀerential\nconditions directly. Our observations here on the existence of diﬀe rent branches of\nsupersymmetric solutions in D= 11 supergravity mirror ﬁndings in related settings,\nnotably half-bps spacetimes with isometry SO(2,2) × SO(4) × SO(4) [37, 38].\nIn the rest of this paper, case by case, we reduce the Killing spinors of the known\nsolutions from D = 11 down on S5 and S2 to isolate the two Killing spinors of the\nLLM ansatz. This allows us to construct all the bilinears explicitly, con ﬁrm that the\nconstant bilinears take the expected form and satisfy ourselves t hat the diﬀerential\nconditions of [23] are satisﬁed. As we will see in due course, the involv ed form of\nthese spinors, especially for the Freund-Rubin spacetimes, sugge sts that using spinor\nbilinears is not an ideal way to solve the Killing spinor equations, and tha t these\nare better solved in D = 11. On the other hand, through the language of spinor\nbilinears, we are in a position to make general statements about sup ersymmetric\nspacetimes beyond LLM.\n2 Review\nWe begin with a lightning review of D = 11 supergravity solutions preserving\nSO(6) × SO(3) symmetry 2. The D = 11 supergravity ansatz may be written as\na warped product of S5, S2 and a Lorentzian signature spacetime, M4,\nds2 = e2λ\n[ 1\nm2 dΩ 2\n5 + e2AdΩ 2\n2 + ds2\nM4\n]\n,\nF(4) = G + vol(S2) ∧ F , (2.1)\nwhere the warp factors, λand A, are functions of the coordinates on M4 and F and\nG are respectively two-forms and four-forms on M4. m is a constant denoting the\ninverse radius of S5. Throughout this work where m does not appear it should be\nassumed that we have set it to unity. We stress that this is the most general ﬂux\nansatz consistent with the symmetries of the metric.\nDespite the symmetries of the ﬂuxes mirroring those of the D = 11 spacetime\nansatz, it is known that the existence of G is inconsistent with supersymmetry in\nthis warped product setting [23], thus generalising a statement th at G cannot be\nturned on perturbatively from the LLM class [21]. Therefore, negle cting orbifolds\n2As in [21, 23] we consider the analytically continued geometries with S5 appearing.\n3\nof AdS5 × S5 [22], all the known regular 3 solutions dual to D= 4 N = 2 SCFTs ﬁt\ninto the LLM class in D= 11.\nWith G set to zero, one ﬁnds the supersymmetry variations as they appe ar in\nLLM [21],\nγµ∂µλǫ± ∓\n( 1\n12e−3λ−2AγµνFµν + mγ5\n)\nǫ∓ = 0 , (2.2)\n(\n±ie−Aγ5 + γµ∂µA\n)\nǫ± ±\n(\nmγ5 + 1\n4e−3λ−2AγµνFµν\n)\nǫ∓ = 0 , (2.3)\n∇µǫ± ±\n( m\n2 γµγ5 + 1\n4e−3λ−2AγνFµν\n)\nǫ∓ = 0 . (2.4)\nA linear combination of (2.2) and (2.3) leads to an algebraic condition ind epen-\ndent of F (\nγµ∂µ(3λ+ A) ± ie−Aγ5\n)\nǫ± ∓ 2mγ5ǫ∓ = 0 . (2.5)\nFurther details of various conventions can be found in the appendix .\nIn the absence of the four-form ﬂux, G, these equations may be solved by iden-\ntifying the two spinors [21]\nǫ− = −γ5ǫ+, (2.6)\nso one only has to solve the Killing spinor equations for a single spinor4. In the\nprocess one ﬁnds a single Killing direction. However, when this condition is relaxed,\none ﬁnds two potentially independent Killing directions [23], and only whe n these\ntwo directions are identiﬁed, does one recover the LLM spinor ansa tz (2.6). As the\nfocus of this work is exploring geometries where the two Killing vector s are treated\nindependently, we henceforth relax (2.6) and deal with the various complications.\nOnce one relaxes the condition on the spinors one can construct an exhaustive\nset of scalar and vector bilinears, a complete list of which can be foun d in appendix\nA. Furthermore, it can be shown that two of the vectors, K1 and ℜ(K8) in the\nnotation of [23], are Killing directions and that the warp factors are in dependent of\nthese directions 5. We will throughout this work refer to these Killing directions as\nX and Y respectively.\n3A well-known remarkable feature of the LLM class of solutions is that supersymmetric solutions\nare in one-to-one correspondence with solutions to the continuum Toda equation. Despite separable\nsolutions to the Toda existing, such as those of [39], only one regula r solution is known [2].\n4One attractive feature of the LLM spinor ansatz is that the vecto r spinor bilinears\n¯ǫγµ ǫ, ¯ǫγ5γµ ǫ, ¯ǫcγµ ǫ one constructs are all mutually orthogonal and deﬁne a natural o rthonormal\nframe.\n5ℜ and ℑ denote real and imaginary parts.\n4\nEmploying a slight rewriting of the results of [23], we document the fo llowing\ndiﬀerential conditions on the scalars:\neAd(e−AS1) = e−AK4, (2.7)\neAd(e−Aℜ(T3)) = −e−Aℑ(K7), (2.8)\ne−3λd(e3λS1) = 2 mℑ(K8), (2.9)\ne−3λd(e3λℜ(T3)) = 2 mK2, (2.10)\ndU2 = −mK5. (2.11)\nFurthermore, supersymmetry tells us that the following bilinears ar e trivial\nU1 = T1 = ℑ(S3) = 0 , (2.12)\nand that we have two constant scalar bilinears\ndS2 = dℑ(T3) = 0 . (2.13)\nThese constants we will refer to henceforth as s and t respectively. As we shall see\nin due course, it is these two constants that play a pivotal role in det ermining the\nﬁnal form of the resulting geometry. An extra bonus is that super symmetry also\nallows us to determine certain bilinears in terms of these constants:\nS3 = −2meAs,\nT2 = 2 meAt,\nK3 = −seAd(3λ+ A),\nℜ(K7) = −teAd(3λ+ A). (2.14)\nMore details on notation and conventions can be found in [23].\n3 Killing vectors\nRecall from [23] that when the Killing vectors Xand Y are identiﬁed one recovers the\nLLM geometries [21]. The goal of this note is to address the possibility of these two\ndirections being independent. To do this, we will in the next subsectio n use general\ntechniques based on the spinor bilinears to determine the relationsh ip between these\nKilling vectors. More particularly, we will determine their inner produc t, their norms\nand work out the Lie derivative of one vector with respect to the ot her.\nAlthough Killing directions that emerge from the Killing spinor equations typ-\nically correspond to R-symmetries, in the subsequent subsection w e show that the\n5\nbilinears and their constituent spinors are indeed generically charge d with respect\nto both X and Y. It is in this sense that we label them “R-symmetries”, though as\nwe will appreciate later, only one of them corresponds to a tradition al R-symmetry\nof the internal geometry.\nHaving shown that X and Y are R-symmetries, this rules out any immediate\nconnection to the work of Gaiotto and Maldacena [25]. As a simple chec k of this,\nwe explicitly show that the U(1) isometry of the hyperbolic space in the Maldacena-\nN´ u˜ nez solution cannot correspond toX or Y, or indeed any combination. Therefore,\nthe connection to [25] is through ﬁrst recovering LLM by setting X = Y and then\ninserting a new U(1) isometry by hand.\n3.1 Commuting vectors\nHere we determine the inner product of X and Y and also the Lie derivative of\none with respect to the other. We will see in due course that the vec tors always\ncommute, a statement that naturally becomes trivial when they ar e the same vector,\ni.e. in LLM. A similar calculation with commuting Killing vectors appeared in [3 5].\nWe begin by addressing when the vectors are orthogonal. Using the Fierz identity\n(A.8), it is possible to show that the inner product of X and Y is\nX· Y = −2\n3st\n[\n1 + 4 m2e2A + e2A\n2 |d(3λ+ A)|2\n]\n, (3.1)\nor by further combining with K3 · ℜ (K7), it is possible to directly show that the\nbracket cannot vanish:\nX· Y = −st\n[\n1 + 4 m2e2A]\n. (3.2)\nIn deriving this result we have made use (2.14). One can conﬁrm that this result is\nindeed consistent with LLM by employing the following rewritings\ns= t = 1 ,\n2X = 2 Y = −KLLM,\n2meA = − sinh ζLLM, (3.3)\nand comparing to (F.31) of LLM [21]. These identities allow us also to infe r the\nfollowing useful identity\ne2A|d(3λ+ A)|2 = (1 + 4 m2e2A). (3.4)\nReturning to (3.2), we observe that the Killing directions Xand Y are orthogonal\nwhenever one of s and t are zero, or indeed when both vanish.\n6\nWe can now calculate the norms of the Killing vectors using (3.4) and ex pressions\nin the appendix (A.11), (A.12). A straightforward calculation then r eveals the\nfollowing:\n|X|2 = −\n[\nS2\n1 + ℜ(T3)2 + t2(1 + 4 m2e2A)\n]\n, (3.5)\n|Y|2 =\n[\nS2\n1 + ℜ(T3)2 − s2(1 + 4 m2e2A)\n]\n. (3.6)\nWe now see that Xis timelike which is expected since its temporal component cannot\nbe zero without the spinors ǫ± being zero (see appendix). In contrast, whether Y is\ntimelike or spacelike depends on the scalars S1 and ℜ(T3), which are zero for LLM,\nin which case, (3.2), (3.5) and (3.6) all agree.\nNow we are on the verge of making an interesting observation. We ca n show that\nthe norm of the diﬀerence X− Y is zero whenever s= t. This means that X− Y is\neither zero or null. Then, it is known from the work of [23] that LLM follows once\nX and Y are identiﬁed. This leaves the only unexplored possibility with s= tbeing\na null spacetime. Later, by integrating the diﬀerential conditions, we will identify\nthis null spacetime uniquely.\nWe now turn attention to whether the vectors X and Y commute or not. This is\nindependent of any choices for sand t. Essentially one can ask under what conditions\nis the Lie derivative of Y with respect to X, LXY ≡ [X,Y ], zero. To answer this\nquestion, one ﬁrst determines dX and dY [23]\ndX = m\n2 [¯ǫ+γ5γµνǫ− − ¯ǫ−γ5γµνǫ+] dxµν + 2mse−3λ−AF, (3.7)\ndY = −m\n2 [¯ǫ+γµνǫ+ − ¯ǫ−γµνǫ−] dxµν + 2mte−3λ−AF. (3.8)\nThe commutator may then be written iXdY − iYdX. This expression can be\ndivided into a part involving contractions with the two-form ﬂux F and a part\nwithout. We ﬁrst focus on the part of the commutator involving F.\nUsing (2.14) and the expressions [23]\niXF = 2 me3λ+2A[\n2sdeA − K3]\n= 2 msd\n[\ne3λ+3A]\n, (3.9)\niYF = 2 me3λ+2A[\n2tdeA − ℜ(K7)\n]\n= 2 mtd\n[\ne3λ+3A]\n, (3.10)\nit is an easy task to convince oneself that these F dependent terms vanish.\nWe now turn attention to the remaining terms. Making use of the follo wing\nidentities:\nγµγµν = 3 γν,\nγµγργµν = −γρν − 3ηρν,\nγµγρσγµν = −γρσν + γρησν − γσηρν, (3.11)\n7\na lengthy calculation 6 involving the Fierz identity reveals that\n[X,Y ] = 2 m2eA[−sℜ(K7) + tK3] , (3.12)\nwhich identically vanishes using (2.14). As a result [ X,Y ] = 0 without having to\nmake any assumption about the constants s or t. In other words, these Killing\nvectors always commute and the LLM class of geometries where X = Y is just one\nconﬁguration where this relationship between the vectors become s trivial. Our hope\nfor the rest of this paper is to identify spacetimes where X and Y are independent.\n3.2 Killing vectors are R-symmetries\nIn this subsection we bring attention to the fact that the spinor bilin ears are in\ngeneral charged with respect to X and Y. Some calculations involving the Fierz\nidentity reveal the following relationships:\nX· K2 = −S1s, (3.13)\nX· K4 = 2 eAsℜ(T3), (3.14)\nX· ℑ(K7) = 2 eAsS1, (3.15)\nX· ℑ(K8) = sℜ(T3), (3.16)\nand\nY · K2 = −tS1, (3.17)\nY · K4 = 2 eAtℜ(T3), (3.18)\nY · ℑ(K7) = 2 eAtS1, (3.19)\nY · ℑ(K8) = tℜ(T3). (3.20)\nUsing (2.7) - (2.10) and the fact that the warp factors are indepen dent of X and\nY [23], we can now infer that the scalar bilinears S1 and ℜ(T3) are charged with\nrespect to both X and Y. Note from (2.5) it is not possible for ǫ+ to be charged\nwhile ǫ− is not, since as the warp factors are independent, we have to conc lude that\nboth ǫ+ and ǫ− are charged with respect to X and Y.\nOne can now worry about what happens when one of sand ttake special values.\nWhen either s or t is set to zero, it would appear that the above bilinears become\nindependent of the X or Y direction. However, by analysing other directions, one\ncan show using (2.11) that the spinors are still charged with respec t to both\nX· K5 = itU2,\nY · K5 = isU2. (3.21)\n6At some point it is good to use the identity 1\n2 ¯ǫ1γρσ ǫ2¯ǫ3γ5γρσν ǫ4 = ¯ǫ3γρ ǫ4¯ǫ1γ5γρν ǫ2.\n8\nMore generally, for generic s, t, with s ̸= t, it can be shown that it is not possible\nto ﬁnd a linear combination so that the Killing spinors become independe nt of this\ndirection.\nHowever, when s= t we see that the spinors are no longer charged with respect\nto the direction X− Y, and further when s= t= 0 that the spinors are no longer\ncharged with respect to both X and Y. We will deal with these special cases in\nthe next section. For the moment, we stress that the Killing spinors are generically\ncharged with respect to both X and Y. We will put this observation to use again\nin the section 4.\nSo far we have assumed that the Killing spinors are completely generic . For\nexample, by conﬁning ourselves to Killing spinors where the scalar biline ar U2 is\nzero, we see that we can ﬁnd a linear combination, i.e. tX − sY, such that the\nabove bilinears are no longer charged with respect to this direction. Then, despite\nit being a bit awkward, we have the freedom to adopt X and tX − sY as our two\nKilling directions, so that the Killing spinors are now only charged with re spect to\none of these directions. However, having set U2 = 0, we also have K5 = 0 and\nusing (2.36) of [23], K9 = 0. As we will discuss more fully in the next section,\nour ansatz generically assumes at least sixteen supersymmetries, a situation which\ncorresponds to the Killing spinor ǫ+ having only a single component. In general,\nit can have a maximum of two independent components correspondin g to maximal\nsupersymmetry. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can th en take ǫ+ to be\na two-component spinor. Then by employing the explicit gamma matric es in the\nappendix, it is possible to show that if U2 = 0, then ǫ− ∝ γ5ǫ+, meaning that we\nare back to LLM. Similar arguments hold when S1 and ℜ(T3) are taken to vanish.\n3.3 Connection to Gaiotto-Maldacena\nSince the continuum Toda equation has a reputation for being diﬃcult to solve,\nstarting with the work of Gaiotto-Maldacena [25] (GM), recent solu tions have been\nconstructed by exploiting an extra U(1) symmetry that may be introduced by hand\nalong the Riemann surface. In the process one trades the Toda eq uation for the\ncylindrically symmetric Laplace equation and a resulting equivalence wit h axially\nsymmetric electrostatic problems in three dimensions [42] (see also [4 3]). As this\nU(1) is a global symmetry, while preserving supersymmetry, one can reduce to IIA\nwhere it is possible to identify further solutions [26, 27].\nWith this added U(1), we now have solutions with two commuting U(1)’s, one\ncorresponding to the original R-symmetry of LLM, and an extra U(1) corresponding\nto a global symmetry. While isometries emerging from the Killing spinor e quations\n9\nare typically expected to correspond to R-symmetries, such as th e isometries arising\nin [20, 21, 16, 17, 18, 19] in the context of D = 11 supergravity, here we look at a\nsample geometry in the GM class and conﬁrm that the added U(1) cannot play any\nrole in X or Y.\nTo do this, we select a prominent example of a spacetime with this extr a U(1)\nsymmetry, namely the Maldacena-N´ u˜ nez solution [2], but with the m etric on the\nhyperbolic space rewritten to highlight the U(1). The overall solution takes the\nform [44]\nds2 = 1\n2W1/ 3\n[\nds2(AdS5) + W−1\n2 cos2 θds2(S2) + 1\n2dθ2\n+ 1\n2ds2(H2) + W−1 sin2 θ(dψ+ v)2\n]\n, (3.22)\nF(4) = cos2 θ\n4W\n[\n− 1\nW[3 + cos 2 θ] sin θdθ(dψ+ v) + cos θvol(H2)\n]\n∧ vol(S2),\nwhere\nW = 1 + cos 2 θ, ds 2(H2) = 4\n[ dr2 + r2dβ2\n(1 − r2)2\n]\n, v = 2r2\n1 − r2 dβ. (3.23)\nNote that this solution corresponds to an analytic continuation of t he LLM\nansatz, but this distinction will not be important for our purposes. As the solution\nis expressed in the form of our ansatz (2.1), we can now simply read o ﬀ the warp\nfactors:\neλ = W1/ 6\n√\n2\n, e A = W−1/ 2 cos θ√\n2\n. (3.24)\nAs X and Y both satisfy the same condition (3.9) and (3.10) up to the constant s\ns and t, we can ask if the Killing vectors ∂ψ and ∂β satisfy this relation. While\n∂ψ satisﬁes this condition, a quick calculation reveals that ∂β cannot correspond to\neither X or Y as when contracted into F it produces a term proportional to drthat\ncannot be sourced form d[e3λ+3A]. For similar reasons, it cannot correspond to the\ndiﬀerence X− Y when s= t.\nSo we summarise what we have learned in this section. When the Killing sp inor\nansatz of LLM is generalised, one ﬁnds two Killing vectors and the naiv e expectation\nis that both of these are “R-symmetries”. By comparing with a typic al example of\nthe GM class of geometries, we see that the U(1) of the Riemann surface cannot\ncorrespond to either of these Killing directions, thus making a direct connection\nbetween our work here and that of GM remote. The connection is th en via LLM,\nsince it was shown in [23] that once the Killing vectors are proportiona l, then they\ncorrespond to the same U(1) and the LLM analysis follows. One is then free to\ninsert a global U(1) and recover the work of GM.\n10\n4 Timelike case\nNow that we have built up a picture of the spinors in terms of spinor bilin ears, we\ncan make a statement about the amount of supersymmetry. The w arped S5 × S2\nansatz already means that we have a large amount of supersymmet ry, notably 16\nsupercharges in the case of LLM [21]. Recall from LLM that the spino rs ǫ± are\nassumed to be directly related through (2.6), so there is only a single spinor. Then\nif one imposes the projection conditions of LLM [21] one ﬁnds a one co mponent\nspinor with a phase that depends only on the R-symmetry 7 .\nNow, more generally, we have to incorporate two charges for the s pinors, one for\neach vector X and Y. From (2.5) we have a relationship between the spinors, so they\nare both charged and we can just focus on one of them. Labeling th ese vectors as\n∂τ and ∂ψ, without loss of generality we can take ǫ+ to be a four-component spinor\nwith one component carrying a phase of the form eiτ. Now, if we have another\nvector ∂ψ with respect to which ǫ+ is also charged, there are only two options.\nEither this phase multiples the original component of the spinor, in wh ich case it is\nindistinguishable from the phase in τ, or it is forced to reside in another component\nof the four-component spinor. Thus, unless ∂τ and ∂ψ are the same vector, as in\nLLM, then supersymmetry is automatically doubled as we have one mo re component\nin the spinor. In other words, we have to have maximal supersymme try.\nThen with maximal supersymmetry in D = 11, it is a well-known theorem [36]\nthat the only solutions are of the Freund-Rubin [40], Kowalski-Glikma n [41] or ﬂat\nspacetime type. There is however a noticeable caveat. We have ass umed the spinors\nare charged to deduce that ﬂat spacetime and the maximally supers ymmetric pp-\nwave are solutions! Indeed, it is precisely for these cases that the spinors are not\ncharged, or only charged under one vector, and this argument do es not apply. We\nwill remedy this in subsequent sections.\nIndeed, the conclusion that beyond LLM there are only maximally sup ersym-\nmetric solutions is already hinted at in (3.9) and (3.10). To see this not e from\nthe appendix that X ≡ K1 must have a temporal component otherwise the sum\nof the norms of the spinors becomes zero, so we will assume it is aligne d solely\nalong the temporal direction. Then Y becomes spacelike when they are orthogonal.\nSo, we see that if s = 0 (an extreme s ̸= t case), then the ﬂux is not along the\ntemporal direction, i.e. the solution is AdS7 × S4, and when t = 0 the solution is\nAdS4 × S7. Then when both s= t= 0, we see that the ﬂux is independent of both\nthe Killing directions and depends on the remaining two transverse dir ections. This\n7See discussion in [21] immediately below (F.48).\n11\nis already suggestively saying that the ﬂux term does not exist and t hat the solution\ncorresponds to ﬂat spacetime.\nIn the rest of this section we address the timelike solutions in turn st arting with\nﬂat spacetime where our argument does not apply. We thus single ou t the ﬂat\nspacetime case where we integrate the diﬀerential conditions on th e spinor bilinears.\nIndeed, only in the ﬂat spacetime case does it look manageable to solv e for the\nKilling spinors directly given the spinor bilinears. For AdS spacetimes, we see\nlater by decomposing the Killing spinors from D = 11 using the gamma matrix\ndecomposition of LLM [21, 23] that the form of ǫ± is more complicated.\n4.1 Flat spacetime\nIn this section we show that ﬂat spacetime follows from the requirem ent that both\nof the constants s and t are set to zero. To do this we make use of an explicit\ndecomposition of the gamma matrices in the appendix (A.7).\nWe begin with the facts. s = t = 0 implies the following additional spinor\nbilinears are zero through (2.14): S3,T2,K3 and ℜ(K7). From (3.14) and (3.18) we\nalso see that X, Y and K4 are mutually orthogonal. Also, we note that X, Y and\nℑ(K8) are also mutually orthogonal from (3.16) and (3.20). Then, it is pos sible to\nuse the Fierz identity to conﬁrm that the inner product of K4 and ℑ(K8) is\nK4 · ℑ(K8) = 2( t2 − s2)meA, (4.1)\nwhich vanishes for the case at hand. As such, these four vectors deﬁne an orthonor-\nmal frame, so we choose to orient X along e0, ℑ(K8) along e1, Y along e2 and K4\nalong e3 in accordance with our choice of gamma matrices (A.7). As this simply\namounts to a choice of frame, we are always at liberty to do this.\nThen, noting that the gamma matrices are themselves tensor prod ucts, we further\ndecompose the spinors as 8\nǫ± = θ± ⊗ η±. (4.2)\nSince we can always rescale η± relative to θ±, without any loss of generality we will\ntake θ†\n±θ± = 1. Plugging these expressions into K3\n1 = K3\n2 = K4\n1 = K4\n2 = 0, and\nrecalling that K4\n3 is, by assumption, non-zero, we arrive at\nθ†\n±σiθ± = 0 , i = 2 ,3. (4.3)\nBearing in mind the unit-norm of θ±, this leaves overall phases\nǫ+ = 1\n√\n2eiβ+\n(\n1\n1\n)\n⊗ η+, ǫ − = 1\n√\n2eiβ−\n(\n1\n−1\n)\n⊗ η−, (4.4)\n8Note only the Killing spinors of ﬂat spacetime can be broken down in suc h a simple form.\n12\nwhere the ﬁnal signs in θ± have been set using S3 = 0 with Y non-zero. The overall\nphases, β±, we can now absorb into η± through a redeﬁnition. We now turn to\ndetermining the form of η±.\nFrom s = 0, K1 · K2 = 0 (via Fierz), X being only along e0 and K8 not being\nalong e0, it is possible to infer the following forms for η±\nη+ =\n(\nx1eiθ1\nx2eiθ2\n)\n, η − =\n(\nx1eiθ3\nx2eiθ4\n)\n, (4.5)\nwith xi,θi ∈ R and one angular constraint θ1 − θ4 = θ2 − θ3. Then by ensuring K8\nis imaginary along e1, but real along e2 - where it corresponds to Y - we can narrow\ndown the form of η± to\nη+ = eiθ1\n(\nx1\n−ix2\n)\n, η − = −ieiθ1\n(\nx1\nix2\n)\n. (4.6)\nWe can now introduce coordinates.\nIn this setting, as many scalar bilinears are zero, the norms of X and Y simplify\nto\n|X|2 = −|Y|2 = −\n[\nS2\n1 + ℜ(T3)2]\n. (4.7)\nAt this point it is also useful to document the norms of the other two vectors making\nup the orthonormal frame\n|K4|2 = S2\n1 + (t2 − s2)4m2e2A, (4.8)\n|ℑ(K8)|2 = S2\n1 + (t2 − s2). (4.9)\nThen introducing the vectors ∂τ and ∂ψ for X and Y respectively, we can deter-\nmine part of the orthonormal frame. The remaining coordinates co me from using\n(2.7) and (2.9), and observing that the RHS of these diﬀerential eq uations are closed.\nThus, we can determine the orthonormal frame in terms of a single b ilinear\ne0 = ( η†\n+σ3η+)dτ, e 1 = e−3λ\n2(η†\n+σ3η+)\ndr5, e 2 = ( η†\n+σ3η+)dψ, e 3 = − e2A\n(η†\n+σ3η+)\ndr2.\n(4.10)\nWe can now integrate (2.7) and (2.9) to establish that\nr2 = e−A(η†\n+σ3η+), r 5 = e3λ(η†\n+σ3η+). (4.11)\nNow, by looking at the diﬀerential conditions for X (3.7) and Y (3.8), we can\ninfer that\n(η†\n+η+)(η†\n+σ3η+) = r−1\n5 , (4.12)\n13\nwhich may be solved in terms of another function β\nx2\n1 = r−1/ 2\n5 cosh β, x 2\n2 = r−1/ 2\n5 sinh β. (4.13)\nFurthermore, from the fact that the RHS of (2.8) and (2.10) are c losed, we can\ndeduce that β is a constant. Finally, if one absorbs various factors involving β in\nthe various coordinates and then rescales, r2 → r−1\n2 , r5 → r2\n5, one recover the usual\nform of ﬂat spacetime from the D= 11 spacetime ansatz (2.1),\nds2 = −dτ2 + dψ2 + dr2\n5 + r2\n5ds2(S5) + dr2\n2 + r2\n2ds2(S2), (4.14)\nwhere the warp factors and the spacetime M4 become\neλ = r5, e A = r2\nr5\n,\nds2(M4) = 1\nr2\n5\n[\n−dt2 + dx2 + dr2\n5 + dr2\n2\n]\n. (4.15)\nAs one ﬁnal consistency check, one can conﬁrm using [23]\ndK4 = m\n2 [¯ǫ+γµνǫ− + ¯ǫ−γµνǫ+] dxµν − e−3λ−2Aℜ(T3)F, (4.16)\ndℑ(K7) = im\n2 [¯ǫ+γ5γµνǫ+ + ¯ǫ−γ5γµνǫ−] dxµν − e−3λ−2AS1F, (4.17)\nthat indeed F = 0 since despite S1 and ℜ(T3) being non-zero, all other terms in\nthese diﬀerential equations are trivial.\nWe can also obtain the same result from D = 11 by simply decomposing the\nKilling spinor. Since we repeat the process later for AdS7 × S4, here we simply state\nresults and omit various details. Note since there is no four-form ﬂu x, the Killing\nspinors are covariantly constant and may be written as\nη= e− α1\n2 Γ α1r5 · · · e− α5\n2 Γ α5α4 e− φ1\n2 Γ φ1r2 e− φ2\n2 Γ φ2φ1 η0, (4.18)\nwhere η0 is a constant spinor and we have parameterised ﬂat spacetime as in ( 4.14).\nWhen one decomposes the spinors in terms of the ansatz of LLM [21]\nη = ψ⊗ eλ/ 2 [χ+ ⊗ ǫ+ + χ− ⊗ ǫ−] , (4.19)\none can proceed to read oﬀ the components,\nǫ+ = 1\n2e−λ/ 2(1 − iγ3γ5)ǫ0,\nǫ− = 1\n2e−λ/ 2(γ3γ5 − i)ǫ0, (4.20)\nwhere ǫ0 is subject to the projector γ1γ5ǫ0 = iǫ0. Observe that, in contrast to\nAdS7 × S4, the simple form of the spinors means that ǫ+ = γ1γ5ǫ−. Observe also\nthat this relationship is a direct consequence of (2.2), when the two -form ﬂux is\nset to zero, and is expected. Using this condition it is easy to see tha t s = t = 0,\nanother signal that everything is consistent.\n14\n4.2 AdS7 × S4\nIn this subsection we look in detail at the decomposition of the Killing sp inors from\nD = 11 to extract out the form of ǫ±. The ﬁnal form of the spinors are quite\ncomplicated and it is not recommendable to solve the Killing spinor equat ions this\nway via spinor bilinears. However, for completeness we determine ǫ± for AdS7 × S4\nand AdS4 × S7.\nThe AdS7 × S4 solution of D= 11 supergravity may be expressed as\nds2 = ds2(AdS7) + 1\n4ds2(S4),\nG4 = 3\n8 vol(S4), (4.21)\nwhere we have adopted the usual normalisations Rµν = −6gµν and Rmn = 3 gmn for\nthe curvature of AdS7 and S4 respectively. We can now rewrite both AdS7 and S4\nas ﬁbrations involving both S5 and S2 respectively\nds2(AdS7) = − cosh2 ρdτ2 + dρ2 + sinh2 ρds2(S5),\nds2(S4) = cos 2 θdψ2 + dθ2 + sin2 θds2(S2). (4.22)\nThis makes the Killing directions, ∂τ and ∂ψ, manifest.\nNow we plan to derive the form of ǫ± for AdS7 × S4 by taking the known Killing\nspinors from D = 11 and decomposing them using the LLM gamma matrices de-\ncomposition [21]:\nΓa = ρa ⊗ σ3 ⊗ γ5,\nΓα = 1 ⊗ σα ⊗ γ5,\nΓµ = 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ γµ, (4.23)\nwhere a = 1 ,..., 5 denotes S5 directions, α = 1 ,2 denotes S2 directions and µ =\n0,..., 3 labels the remaining directions. Making use of the coordinates αi, i= 1 ,..., 5\nfor S5 and φi, i= 1 ,2 for S2, one can solve the D= 11 Killing spinor equation\n∇Mη+ 1\n288\n[\nΓ NPQR\nM − 8δ N\nM ΓPQR\n]\nGNPQRη= 0 , (4.24)\nleading to the solution\nη = e− ρ\n2 γΓ ρe− τ\n2 γΓ 0 e− α1\n2 Γ α1ρe− α2\n2 Γ α2α1 · · · e− α5\n2 Γ α5α4 ˜η,\n˜η = e− θ\n2 γΓ θe− ψ\n2 γΓ ψ e− φ1\n2 Γ φ1θe− φ2\n2 Γ φ2φ1 η0, (4.25)\nwhere η0 is a constant spinor and we have deﬁned\nγ = Γ ψθφ 1φ2 . (4.26)\n15\nBefore proceeding further, it is prudent to keep one eye on the ﬁn al form of the\nKilling spinor of LLM (4.19) where now eλ = sinh ρ is the warp factor, ψ denotes\nthe Killing spinor on S5 and χ± are Killing spinors on S2 satisfying\n∇αχ± = ± i\n2σαχ±, χ − = iσ3χ+. (4.27)\nIn terms of our choice of coordinates, these may be expressed as\nχ± = e± φ1\n2 iσ1 e\nφ2\n2 iσ3 χ(0)\n± , (4.28)\nwhere χ(0)\n± denotes constant spinors. Observe that the second condition in ( 4.27)\nmeans that we cannot have the same constant Killing spinor and inste ad require\nχ(0)\n− = iχ(0)\n+ .\nTo proceed, we decompose the constant spinor as\nη0 ≡ ψ0 ⊗ χ(0)\n+ ⊗ ǫ0. (4.29)\nThen making use of the relationships\n1\n2(χ+ − iχ−) = cos φ1\n2 eiφ2\n2 σ3 χ(0)\n+ ,\n− i\n2(χ+ + iχ−) = sin φ1\n2 σ1eiφ2\n2 σ3 χ(0)\n+ , (4.30)\none can determine\n˜η= ψ0 ⊗\n[\nξ+ ⊗ e−iθ\n2 γψ eiψ\n2 γθǫ0 − iξ− ⊗ γθγ5eiθ\n2 γψ eiψ\n2 γθǫ0\n]\n, (4.31)\nwhere we have momentarily redeﬁned\nξ± = 1\n2(χ+ ∓ iχ−), so that σ3ξ± = ±ξ±. (4.32)\nTo complete the Killing spinor, we impose the projector\nγργ5ǫ0 = iǫ0, (4.33)\nso that\nη = ψ⊗\n[\nξ+ ⊗ e\nρ\n2 γ0γ5 e−iθ\n2 γψ eiψ\n2 γθeiτ\n2 ǫ0\n− iξ− ⊗ γθγ5e\nρ\n2 γ0γ5 eiθ\n2 γψ eiψ\n2 γθeiτ\n2 ǫ0\n]\n, (4.34)\nwith ψ now denoting the Killing spinor on S5 satisfying ∇aψ = i\n2 ρaψ. Imposing\nthe projector (4.33) ensures that the Killing spinor ﬁts into the req uired form of\n16\nLLM. Observe also that this is one projector less than the number im posed to get\nthe LLM class of solutions (see appendix F of [21]) and, as a result, th e geometry\nhas maximal supersymmetry, instead of sixteen supersymmetries . Throughout we\nhave deﬁned\nγ5 = iγ0ρψθ . (4.35)\nSubstituting back in for χ± and ﬁnally comparing with (4.19), it is easy to read oﬀ\nthe eventual form of the Killing spinors\nǫ+ = 1\n2e−λ/ 2\n[\ne\nρ\n2 γ0γ5 e−iθ\n2 γψ − iγθγ5e\nρ\n2 γ0γ5 eiθ\n2 γψ\n]\neiψ\n2 γθeiτ\n2 ǫ0\nǫ− = 1\n2e−λ/ 2\n[\nγθγ5e\nρ\n2 γ0γ5 eiθ\n2 γψ − ie\nρ\n2 γ0γ5 e−iθ\n2 γψ\n]\neiψ\n2 γθeiτ\n2 ǫ0. (4.36)\nIt is possible to see that in agreement with expectations that s = 0. It is also\npossible to show that these Killing spinors satisfy the diﬀerential con ditions for the\nscalar and vector bilinears presented in generality in [23].\n4.3 AdS4 × S7\nThe AdS4 × S7 solution may be written as\nds2 = ds2(AdS4) + 4 ds2(S7),\nF(4) = 3 vol( AdS3), (4.37)\nwhere we have normalised Rµν = −3gµν for AdS4 and Rmn = 6 gmn for S7. Rewriting\nthe solution in terms of the ansatz (2.1),\nds2(AdS4) = − cosh2 ρdτ2 + dρ2 + sinh2 ρds2(S2),\nds2(S7) = cos 2 θdψ2 + dθ2 + sin2 θds2(S5), (4.38)\nthe solution to the D= 11 KSE (4.24) is\nη = e− ρ\n2 γΓ ρe− τ\n2 γΓ 0 e− φ1\n2 Γ φ1ρe− φ2\n2 Γ φ2φ1 ˜η,\n˜η = e− θ\n2 γΓ θe− ψ\n2 γΓ ψ e− α1\n2 Γ α1θ · · · e− α5\n2 Γ α5α4 η0, (4.39)\nwhere η0 is a constant spinor and here\nγ = Γ τρφ1φ2 . (4.40)\nIn decomposing down to spinors living on M4 we repeat as before to get\nǫ+ = 1\n2e−λ/ 2\n[\ne\nθ\n2 γψ γ5 eiρ\n2 γ0 − iγργ5e\nθ\n2 γψ γ5 e−iρ\n2 γ0\n]\neiτ\n2 γρeiψ\n2 ǫ0\nǫ− = 1\n2e−λ/ 2\n[\nγργ5e\nθ\n2 γψ γ5 e−iρ\n2 γ0 − ie\nθ\n2 γψ γ5 eiρ\n2 γ0\n]\neiτ\n2 γρeiψ\n2 ǫ0, (4.41)\n17\nwith ǫ0 a constant spinor satisfying γθγ5ǫ0 = iǫ0 where γ5 is deﬁned in (4.35). Again\none can check that the expected algebraic and diﬀerential conditio ns are satisﬁed\nand that in this case t= 0.\n5 Null case\nAs noted earlier when s = t, we have two options. Either X = Y, in which case\nwe return to LLM [23], or we can take the vector X − Y to be null. At this\npoint signiﬁcant questions still remain concerning supersymmetry a nd the expected\nspacetimes in this class. While on one hand we may expect the Kowalski- Glikman\n[41] solution to solve our diﬀerential conditions since it ﬁts into the SO(6) × SO(3)\nansatz, on the other hand, as the Killing spinors only depend on the c ombination\nX+Y, we cannot argue that supersymmetry is maximal and it is possible th at there\nare spacetimes with 16 supersymmetries. Indeed, simply in the class of pp-waves,\nwe can expect solutions other than Kowalski-Glikman, since it is a well-k nown fact\nthat all pp-waves preserve at least 16 supersymmetries.\nSo to get a better grasp on the geometries in this null class, here we opt to inte-\ngrate the supersymmetry conditions. In the process we look for o ther null spacetime\nsolutions which are not pp-waves. As emphasised above, even in the class of pp-wave\nsolutions, there are numerous options in D= 11 between half-maximal and maximal\nsupersymmetry [46].\n5.1 Kowalski-Glikman\nFrom our earlier analysis we know that X− Y is a null vector when s= t, so we can\nintroduce the coordinates x+, x− and associated Killing vectors ∂+, ∂−, through\ndeﬁning\nX− Y = −C∂+,\nX+ Y = A∂− + B∂+, (5.1)\nwhere as X and Y commute, the functions A and B are independent of x+, and C\nis taken to be a constant.\nIt is now easy to see from (2.7) - (2.10) and (3.13) - (3.20) that S1 and ℜ(T3) are\nindependent of X− Y, so these directions only depend on x−. It is also clear from\nthe same equations that we can introduce the following ansatz for S1,\nS1 = fcos(κx−), (5.2)\n18\nwhere f now depends only on the, yet to be determined, transverse direct ions and\nκ is a constant. This in turn determines\nℜ(T3) = −Aκf\n4s sin(κx−). (5.3)\nSubstituting back into (2.8), (3.15) and (3.19), we can then determ ine A to be a\nconstant\nA = 4s\nκ, (5.4)\nso S1 and ℜ(T3) are now related up to trigonometric functions. For simplicity, we\nnow set A = C through the choice κ= 4 sC−1.\nIn contrast to the timelike ﬂat case, X,Y,K 4 and ℑ(K8) are no longer orthogonal,\nbut it is easy to deﬁne an orthonormal frame by shifting K4 and ℑ(K8) appropri-\nately,\n˜K4 = K4 + 2seAℜ(T3)\nS2\n1 + ℜ(T3)2 (X− Y),\nℑ( ˜K8) = ℑ(K8) + sℜ(T3)\nS2\n1 + ℜ(T3)2 (X− Y). (5.5)\nIt is easy to check using (3.14), (3.16), (3.18) and (3.20) that thes e new directions\nare orthogonal to the plane spanned by X and Y. Observe also that there is no\ndiﬀerence between the norm of K4 and ˜K4, or alternatively ℑ(K8) and ℑ( ˜K8), as\nthe shift is along a null direction.\nUsing the fact that the RHS of (2.7) and (2.9) are closed, we can now introduce\ncoordinates, r2 and r5, through deﬁning\ne−Af = 1\nr2\n, (5.6)\ne3λf = r2\n5. (5.7)\nIn turn, this means that K4 and ℑ(K8) become\nK4 = −eAf\n[\ncos(κx−)dr2\nr2\n+ κsin(κx−)dx−\n]\n,\nℑ(K8) = f\n[\ncos(κx−)dr5\nr5\n− 1\n2κsin(κx−)dx−\n]\n. (5.8)\nWe have chosen the powers in (5.6) and (5.7) appropriately so that t he metric\ntakes a familiar form, though it should be stressed that closure allow s us to do this.\nIndeed, we can go further and choose the form f. From K4 · dλ, calculated directly\nfrom (2.2), we see that λis independent of the coordinate r2. Then by rescaling the\ncoordinate r5 appropriately we can take\nf = 1\nr5\n, e A = r2\nr5\n. (5.9)\n19\nNote, we can also determine the form of f by calculating the quantity ( X+ Y) ·\nd(X− Y) as prescribed in appendix B. Observe that when s= tthe second term in\n(B.5) disappears and if one follows the calculation through (with m= 1), one ﬁnds\nthat f = r−1\n5 .\nNow, using the norms (4.8) and (4.9) we can determine gr2r2 and gr5r5 , compo-\nnents of the inverse metric. Similarly from (3.5) and (3.6) we can work out the rest\nof the metric. The form of the spacetime then becomes\nds2(M4) = 4\nC2r2\n5\n[\ndx+dx− −\n(\ns2(r2\n5 + 4r2\n2) + B\nC\n)\n(dx−)2\n]\n+ 1\nr2\n5\n(dr2\n2 + dr2\n5). (5.10)\nAt this point it is worth observing that the overall D = 11 spacetime is of the\nform of a pp-wave since eλ = r5. It is also looking suggestive that the pp-wave in\nquestion may be the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave. To conﬁrm t his we can\ndetermine the ﬂux term F by contracting in the vector X+ Y and using (3.9) and\n(3.10). The two-form ﬂux term of the D = 11 ansatz (2.1) may be determined to\nbe of the form\nF = 12\nCsr2\n2dx− ∧ dr2. (5.11)\nThe Kowalski-Glikman solution (5.13) then simply corresponds to the c hoice9\nC =\n√\n2, s = µ\n6\n√\n2, B = 0 . (5.12)\nSo, in summary, we have identiﬁed the null spacetime that arises fro m the LLM\nansatz uniquely. Not only is it a pp-wave, but it is the maximally supersy mmetric\npp-wave, or Kowalski-Glikman solution [41]. For completeness we deco mpose the\nKilling spinors from D = 11 in the next subsection to work out the Killing spinors\nǫ±.\n5.2 Decomposition\nHere we derive the Killing spinor for the Kowalski-Glikman solution [41], us ing\nspherical coordinates to make the SO(6)×SO(3) isometry manifest. Essentially our\nanalysis parallels that of [45] modulo this change in coordinates. The KG solution\n9Here we have set B = 0 by hand. However, more generally if it is assumed to be of the usua l\nform B = Bijxixj in Cartesian coordinates, where Bij is a real constant symmetric matrix, (19) of\n[46] tells us that for greater than sixteen supersymmetries we req uire ∑\nj Bij Γ jχ = 0. Therefore,\nwe either have maximal supersymmetry when B = 0, or half the supersymmetry when B ̸= 0.\n20\nmay be written as\nds2 = 2 dx+dx− − µ2\n36\n(\n4r2\n2 + r2\n5\n)\n(dx−)2 + dr2\n2 + r2\n2ds2(S2) + dr2\n5 + r2\n5ds2(S5),\nF(4) = µr2\n2dx− ∧ dr2 ∧ vol(S2). (5.13)\nWe introduce the vielbein\ne− = dx−,\ne+ = dx+ − µ2\n72(4r2\n2 + r2\n5)dx−,\ne1 = dr2, e 2 = r2dφ1, e 3 = r2 sin φ1dφ2,\ne4 = dr5, e 5 = r5dα1,...,e 9 = r5 sin α1 ... sin α4dα5, (5.14)\nwhere we have used the usual nested expressions for coordinate s on the respective\nspheres.\nWriting the Killing spinor equation as\n∇Mη+ Ω Mη = 0 , (5.15)\nexpressions for the various Ω M take the form\nΩ + = 0 ,\nΩ − = − µ\n12 (Γ+Γ− + 1) I,\nΩ i = µ\n6 Γ+IΓi, i = 1 ,2,3,\nΩ i = µ\n12Γ+IΓi, i = 4 ,..., 9, (5.16)\nwhere I = Γ 123.\nIt is easy to solve for the standard Killing spinors, namely those in the kernel of\nΓ+, with the only diﬀerence in moving from cartesian to spherical coord inates being\nthat one has more spin connection expressions which enter the ana lysis. As always\nthe Killing spinors are independent of x+ as both Ω + and the spin connection in\nthis direction vanish. The standard Killing spinors are thus\nηstan = e\nµ\n4 Ix−\ne− φ1\n2 Γ 21 e− φ2\n2 Γ 32 e− α1\n2 Γ 54 · · · e− α5\n2 Γ 98 ψ+, (5.17)\nwhere ψ+ is a constant spinor satisfying Γ +ψ+ = 0. Up the the presence of the x−\ndependence, this is just the Killing spinor equation in ﬂat spacetime. T his is entirely\nexpected as the ﬂux terms all come with an x− component, which when lowered,\nkills ψ+.\n21\nOur task now is to ﬁnd the remaining supernumerary Killing spinors, a t ask\nthat is complicated somewhat by the Ω i terms not immediately vanishing. Using\nΩ iΩ j = 0 it is possible to show that the supernumerary Killing spinors are linea r in\njust r2 and r5 with the ﬁnal form of the D= 11 Killing spinor being\nη = (1 − r2Ω 1 − r5Ω 4)\n[\ne\nµ\n4 Ix− ˜ψ+ + e\nµ\n12 Ix− ˜ψ−\n]\n, (5.18)\nwhere in ˜ψ± we have absorbed all the angular dependence. These spinors are s ubject\nto the projectors Γ ± ˜ψ± = 0.\nThen, proceeding as before, we can decompose the D = 11 Killing spinor and\nextract out ǫ± from the LLM ansatz:\nǫ+ = 1\n2e−λ/ 2\n[\n(1 − iγr2 γ5)eiµ\n4 γr2 x−\nψ+ + (1 − iγr2 γ5)eiµ\n12 γr2 x−\nψ−\n− ir2\nµ\n6 γ+(1 + iγr2 γ5)eiµ\n12 γr2 x−\nψ− − ir5\nµ\n12γ+(1 − iγr2 γ5)eiµ\n12 γr2 x−\nψ−\n]\n,\nǫ− = 1\n2e−λ/ 2\n[\n(γr2 γ5 − i)eiµ\n4 γr2 x−\nψ+ + (γr2 γ5 − i)eiµ\n12 γr2 x−\nψ−\n+ ir2\nµ\n6 γ+(γr2 γ5 + i)eiµ\n12 γr2 x−\nψ− + ir5\nµ\n12γ+(γr2 γ5 − i)eiµ\n12 γr2 x−\nψ−\n]\n. (5.19)\nHere in addition to Γ ±ψ± = 0, the constant spinors ψ± also satisfy γr5 γ5ψ± = iψ±.\nNotice here that when we take µ→ 0 we recover the Killing spinors for ﬂat spacetime\n(4.20), so we can have some degree of conﬁdence in this result. Goin g further one\ncan determine the form of the two constants s,t. Once the constant spinors are\nscaled correctly, in terms of the mass parameter µ they take the form\ns= t= µ, (5.20)\nthus giving a physical meaning to these constants. Again, using the explicit form of\nthe spinors, one can check that the expected geometric condition s on the bilinears\nare satisﬁed.\n6 Discussion\nIn this work we have attempted to address a notable loose-end in th e analysis of\n[23]. While this earlier work did rule out the existence of an additional ﬂu x term in\nthe context of the earlier LLM ansatz [21], when one generalised th e Killing spinor\nansatz, two Killing vectors were found. As geometries dual to N = 2 SCFTs only\nrealise SU(2) × U(1) R-symmetry, this raised a pertinent question about the natur e\n22\nof the mysterious second isometry direction. Thus, the goal of th is paper was to\nidentify solutions beyond LLM in which these two Killing directions are ma nifest.\nSo, in this paper we have performed a further study of these two K illing di-\nrections. By using general techniques we have shown that they alw ays commute\nand that their inner product is proportional to the product of two fundamental\nscalar bilinears. In addition, we have conﬁrmed expectations that t he isometry di-\nrections correspond to R-symmetries and shown that the connec tion to the work of\nGaiotto-Maldacena is through LLM. We have then argued that the p resence of two\nindependent R-symmetries means that supersymmetry will be enha nced beyond the\nsixteen supersymmetries of LLM leading to geometries with maximum s upersym-\nmetry. Where this argument fails to hold, namely for ﬂat spacetime a nd pp-waves,\nwe have integrated the supersymmetry conditions directly.\nInterestingly, through our work here, we see that constant sca lar bilinears play\na central role in determining the ﬁnal form of the geometry. While th ese scalars are\ntypically normalised to unity, we observe that when one of the two is s et to zero\nwe ﬁnd an AdS spacetime, whereas if both are set to zero, ﬂat spacetime is the\nonly outcome. Moreover, when both constants are equal and the re is a null Killing\nvector, we have shown that these constants correspond to the mass parameter in the\nKowalski-Glikman solution. Therefore, our overarching description allows us to put\nall the maximally supersymmetric solutions on the same footing as LLM . However,\nwe must caution that supersymmetric interpolating ﬂows from AdS7 × S4 to LLM,\ngeneralising those based on dimensional reduction [47], are not expe cted as the end-\npoints correspond to diﬀerent values of the fundamental consta nts. In other words,\nif interpolating solutions exist, we can expect them to be non-super symmetric, or\nto not include one of the end-points.\nEchoing the introduction, we stress that the identiﬁcation of the is ometries with\nthose of the maximally supersymmetric geometries brings the more g eneral form of\nthe Killing spinor ansatz of LLM to its logical conclusion. A similar outcom e was\nnoted in [35] where, an LLM-type ansatz in type IIB proved to be inc onsistent with\nthe existence of a U(1) R-symmetry, and in the process, AdS5 × S5 was recovered.\nAs such, the SU(2) should be non-geometric for N = 2 SCFT duals in type IIB.\nThe work here suggests that new geometries dual to N = 2 SCFTs may be found\nin type IIB supergravity by searching for an extra U(1) in the classiﬁcation of [48].\nIt remains to be seen if any of them are regular.\n23\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to P.

Here we provide a brief summary. On the external space M4 with signature\n(−,+,+,+) we will take ǫ0123 = 1. As a result, deﬁning γ5 = iγ0123, we have\nγ2\n5 = +1. We will then adopt\n(γ0)† = −γ0, (γi)† = γi, (A.1)\nAlso from LLM [21], we see that the intertwiners A and C are given by\nA≡ γ0, C ≡ γ2. (A.2)\nFrom (A.1) this means that\nAγµA−1 = −γ†\nµ. (A.3)\nIn LLM γ2 is antisymmetric and γ0,γ1,γ3 symmetric so that\nC−1γT\nµ C = −γµ. (A.4)\nNote that subject to these choices\nγ†\n5 = γ5, γ T\n5 = −γ5. (A.5)\nThen deﬁning D= CAT in the usual fashion, we can deﬁne the conjugate spinor\nto ǫ as ǫc = Dǫ∗ = γ2γ0ǫ∗. This implies that ¯ ǫc = −ǫTγ2. Note also that D = γ2γ0\nand that DD∗ = +1, so that we have the freedom to take ǫto be a Majorana spinor\nprovided we impose ǫc = ǫ.\nGiven spinors χ,ξ and spinor bilinears constructed from pantisymmetrised gamma\nmatrices γ(p) ≡ γµ1···µp, we have the following symmetry properties for the spinor\nbilinears\n( ¯χγ(p)ξ)† = ( −1)\np(p+1)\n2 +1 ¯ξγ(p)χ,\n( ¯χcγ(p)ξ)T = ( −1)\np(p+1)\n2 +1 ¯ξcγ(p)χ. (A.6)\n24\nFinally, an explicit representation of the above γ matrices may be written:\nγ0 = 1 ⊗ iσ3, γ 1 = 1 ⊗ σ1, γ 2 = σ1 ⊗ σ2, γ 3 = σ2 ⊗ σ2.
