This problem is particularly pronounced for the more than 2 million emergency depart-\nment (ED) patients evaluated for urinary tract infections (UTIs) each year.[2] These patients often present\nwith higher acuity, atypical symptoms, and worse baseline resistance patterns,[3] which increase the com-\nplexity of their cases.[4] As with other infections, UTIs with antibiotic resistance are more likely to progress\nto sepsis, result in prolonged hospital stays, and contribute to morbidity and mortality.[5, 6]\nCompounding these issues is the fact that gold-standard diagnostic criteria from the CDC and the Infectious\nDiseases Society of America (ISDA) rely on microbial culture data, which is typically not available at the time\nof patient evaluation.[7] ED clinicians must therefore initiate antibiotics based on incomplete information,\nincluding patient symptoms, physical exam ﬁndings, and urinalysis results. Prior studies have indicated\nthat improvements could be made in 30%–60% of cases regarding UTI diagnosis, treatment indications,\nagent choice, and antibiotic therapy duration in the ED setting.[4, 8] Many patients who are diagnosed\nwith UTI and started on antibiotics in the ED ultimately have negative urine cultures, suggesting unnec-\nessary treatment.[9–11] Other patients whose urine culture data is ultimately positive are treated with\nantibiotics despite the lack of signs or symptoms suggestive of infection[12]–such treatment of so-called\n“asymptomatic bacteriuria” poses its own risks, including antibiotic resistance, medication side eﬀects,\nand increased length of stay.[13, 14] Once initiated, antibiotics are often continued inappropriately.[15] It\nis therefore desirable to improve the accuracy of UTI diagnosis in real time and to study UTI diagnosis and\ntreatment at a large scale.\nImportance\nIdentiﬁcation of patient signs (i.e., physical exam ﬁndings) and symptoms is essential for UTI diagnosis\nand the development of machine learning models for predicting and surveilling UTIs, as it allows for the\ndiﬀerentiation of a UTI and asymptomatic bacteruria.[16] The documentation of UTI symptoms can be ei-\nther structured (e.g., ICD-10 codes) or—as is often the case with signs and symptoms—unstructured (e.g.,\nclinical notes), complicating symptom extraction. Natural language processing (NLP) has been employed\nto extract patient symptoms and diagnoses from clinical notes, including UTI symptoms from home care\nnursing notes.[17] However, well-validated NLP methods for UTI symptom extraction in the ED are lacking.\nVarious NLP techniques, such as rule-based methods, machine learning, deep learning, and large language\n2\n .

In turn, we hope\nto facilitate research and public health surveillance by removing barriers to UTI sign and symptom iden-\ntiﬁcation from EHR databases and help pave the way for improved UTI diagnosis, treatment, and patient\noutcomes in the face of rising ED volumes, patient complexity, and antibiotic resistance.\nMethods\nStudy Population and Setting\nThe study population consisted of adult patients ( ≥ 18 years of age) who presented to the emergency\ndepartment (ED) between June 2013 and August 2021 and had a urinalysis sent during their visit. The study\nwas conducted across ten sites within a regional healthcare network in the northeastern United States,\ncovering a geographic area of approximately 650 square miles. The study followed the STROBE reporting\nguidelines for observational studies.[18] Our institutional review board approved this research and waived\nthe need for informed consent (HIC# 1602017249).\nData Collection and Processing\nPatient demographic and clinical data were extracted from the system-wide electronic health record (Epic,\nVerona, WI) using a centralized data warehouse (Helix). The warehouse includes procedural instances (Epic\nprocedural codes), prescription and medications, ICD-10 code diagnoses, laboratory records, and clinical\nnotes.\nDeﬁning UTI Signs and Symptoms\nWe identiﬁed a comprehensive set of likely and potential UTI signs and symptoms, identiﬁed through lit-\nerature review,[19–21] society guidelines,[22, 23] and expert opinion (AT, MI). The following list of signs\nsymptoms, presented in Table 1, served as the basis for our annotation process.\n3\n .

The process began with the assembly of a diverse and representa-\ntive set of ED provider notes from the above visits; notes were authored by an attending physician, an at-\ntending physician and resident physician jointly, an advanced practice provider (APP; a physician assistant,\nnurse practitioner, or advanced practice registered nurse) alone, or an APP and attending physician. Our\nnote dataset was randomly selected and enriched for patients with UTI diagnoses and admitted patients\nso that it included, in roughly equal parts, patients who were admitted with a UTI diagnosis (see Table S1\nfor deﬁnitions), patients who were admitted without a UTI diagnosis, patients who were discharged with\na UTI diagnosis, and patients who were discharged without a UTI diagnosis.\nDuring an initial review of notes, we noticed that UTI signs or symptoms were localized to individual spans of\ntext. Therefore, we framed the UTI symptom annotation task as a classic manual named entity recognition\n(NER) inside-outside-beginning (IOB) labeling task. However, given that the goal of our study was to train\nan NLP pipeline to identify patients with particular UTI signs or symptoms, we evaluated our annotation\nand model performance as a multilabel classiﬁcation task, at the note level (i.e., our evaluation only con-\nsiders the presence/absence of a particular symptom in the clinical note as a whole, not the particular text\n4\n .

The annotation process began with the initial manual annotation\nof a set of 100 clinical notes by both MI and AT; MI and AT then adjudicated any conﬂicting annotations to\ncreate a “gold standard” annotation set through which to evaluate additional annotators. Following the ini-\ntial manual annotation, a human-in-the-loop approach was employed to train the model on the remaining\nannotations. Our team of additional experienced annotators, comprising senior emergency medicine resi-\ndent physicians, underwent thorough training on annotation guidelines developed by MI and AT including\nthe notes and deﬁnitions in Table 1. Each annotator then annotated the gold-standard set of 100 provider\nnotes adjudicated by MI and AT; their performance was assessed by measuring inter-annotator agreement\nusing support-weighted average F1 measures (harmonic mean of precision and recall). This metric allowed\nus to evaluate the consistency between annotators, ensuring a reliable and standardized annotation pro-\ncess throughout the study. Annotators with an overall F1 measure of >0.8 across annotations were allowed\nto proceed to independently annotate notes after receiving feedback on their initial annotations. Dur-\ning the annotation process, we maintained open communication channels among annotators to facilitate\ndiscussion, address uncertainties, and resolve ambiguities.\nAnnotation Environment\nFor annotation we employed Prodigy v1.11.7., a scriptable annotation tool designed to maximize eﬃciency,\nenabling data scientists to perform the annotation tasks themselves and facilitating rapid iterative devel-\nopment in natural language processing (NLP) projects. Prodigy uses transfer learning to develop models\nwith fewer examples, streamlining data collection for NLP projects. Its active learning system focuses on\nambiguous model examples to improve annotation eﬃciency.\n5\n .

We focus\non two task-speciﬁc LLMs in particular: a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN)-based SpaCy\nmodel, and Clinical Longformer,[25] a transformer-based model that can leverage the longer context win-\ndows common to clinical text and has been shown to outperform classic Bidirectional Encoder Represen-\ntations from Transformers (BERT)-based models on a number of information extraction tasks.[25] Training\nthese two methods allows for comparison between classic non-transformer based methods and the state-\nof-the-art in information extraction of long clinical texts. Transformer-based models have demonstrated\nexceptional performance in various NLP tasks by capturing complex contextual information from large-scale\ntext corpora, but require a large number of annotations, while simpler methods such as SpaCy may per-\nform better under label-constrained settings. The SpaCy pipeline is an ensemble of a bag-of-words-based\nand a CNN-based model. The Clinical Longformer was initialized from the general domain Longformer,\ntrained on English Wikipedia, open-source books, and news articles. It was further pretrained on MIMIC-III\nclinical notes to tailor the model to clinical texts. To adapt both models for the speciﬁc task of UTI sign\nand symptom identiﬁcation, we employed a ﬁne-tuning process that leveraged our annotated dataset con-\nsisting of emergency department provider notes. During the ﬁne-tuning phase, the pre-trained models\nwere further trained on the task-speciﬁc dataset, allowing them to learn the nuances of clinical text and\nUTI-related symptoms. The SpaCy model is randomly initialized and trains both the bag-of-words model\nand the CNN model from scratch based on the provided dataset. The Clinical Longformer model instead\nﬁne-tunes a multi-class classiﬁcation layer on top of the base model. In the NER setting, both the SpaCy\nand Longformer models select a class from each of the IOB tags, for each UTI symptom (e.g. I-FEVER, B-\nDYSURIA), as well as an outside tag indicating a word not part of any UTI symptom (“O”), for a total of 35\nclasses. The Longformer model was ﬁne-tuned using a multi-class classiﬁcation layer added on top of the\nbase model, with each class representing one of the UTI symptoms with an IOB tag or an additional class\nfor non-symptom text. We used a cross-entropy loss function for training, which calculates the diﬀerence\nbetween the model’s predicted probability distribution and the true label distribution. The training pro-\ncess involved several iterations over an 80% split of the dataset (1,000 of 1,250 notes), stratiﬁed by the\noccurrence of certain UTI sign or symptom labels, with a pre-deﬁned batch size, and gradient descent op-\ntimization was utilized to minimize the loss function.[26] The ﬁne-tuned models were then evaluated on a\nheld-out test set of 250 notes (20%) to assess its generalization capability and performance in identifying\nUTI signs and symptoms in unseen clinical text. To evaluate model performance, we post-processed the\noutput of the NER pipelines, which identiﬁed references to speciﬁc named entities (single words, abbre-\nviations, or phrases), to determine the existence of UTI symptoms within a particular note. This entailed\ncalculating a binary variable for the model-identiﬁed presence or absence of a named entity at the note\n6\n .

Longformer model precision ranged from 0.58 for\nurinary retention to 1.00 for ﬂank pain; recall ranged from 0.50 for urinary incontinence to 1.00 for low\nback pain and altered mental status; F1 measure ranged from 0.55 for urinary incontinence to 0.98 for\nﬂank pain. Overall support-weighted model precision of the SpaCy model was 0.89, recall was 0.83, and\nF1 measure was 0.84. SpaCy model precision ranged from 0 for urinary incontinence to 1.00 for urinary\nfrequency, urinary urgency, altered mental status, and suprapubic tenderness; recall ranged from 0 for uri-\nnary incontinence to 0.98 for abdominal pain; F1 measure ranged from 0 for urinary incontinence to 0.96\nfor abdominal pain. Computing the macro-average precision, recall, and F1-scores across UTI symptoms,\nweighted by their prevalence in the dataset, allows us to account for label imbalance in our model eval-\nuation.

Be-\ncause UTI diagnosis relies on signs and symptoms in addition to laboratory ﬁndings, such document-level\nclassiﬁcation is necessary to facilitate EHR-based UTI diagnosis on a large scale. These ﬁndings echo prior\nresearch describing NLP-based symptom information extraction from a variety of source documents.[27–\n29] Model performance tended to be higher for entities with greater support (e.g., abdominal pain) and\nlower for those with lower support (e.g., urinary incontinence). Overall model performance at detecting\nthe presence of any UTI sign or symptom was excellent for both models, with F1 measures of 0.96 and 0.98\nfor the standard-sequence CNN-based model (SpaCy) and long-sequence transformer-based model (Long-\nformer), respectively, supporting the utility of NER for aiding in EHR-based UTI diagnosis. Consistent with\nprior research[25] showing improved performance of long-sequence transformer models (Longformer, Big-\nBird) over standard-sequence models (RoBERTa, BERT) at clinical NER tasks, we found slightly better overall\nperformance for our-long-sequence model. While the phrases referring to the named entities themselves\n10\n .

A downside to long-sequence models is that they require greater memory and computational\nresources, potentially limiting real-time use.\nChallenges and Limitations\nWe faced several challenges that may be relevant to NLP-based symptom extraction tasks in other medical\ndomains and contexts. First, because our dataset involved clinical notes with various formats and tem-\nplates (related to clinical site, time of authorship, and author-speciﬁc practices), there were inconsistencies\nin the phrasing and verbiage surrounding documentation of signs or symptoms. Second, as in many medi-\ncal NER tasks including a prior study using NLP to extract UTI-related information from home care nursing\nnotes,[17, 30] we encountered frequent use of abbreviations, synonyms, and ambiguous terms (e.g., “AP”\nused to refer to “abdominal pain”–a named entity of interest–but also to “abdomen and pelvis” in com-\nputed tomography imaging, and “anteroposterior” in X-ray imaging, among numerous other concepts).\nThird, notes frequently included references to the absence of signs or symptoms, and we did not consider\nsuch references to negated entities to be instances of the named entities; we noted that the model per-\nformed poorly when words of negation (e.g., “denies” or “no”) were distant from the negated entity. The\nincorporation of a separate, dedicated “negation detection” model may improve model performance in\nNER tasks and will be explored in future work.[31] Finally, our dataset was highly imbalanced for the rarer\nentities. Because our primary objective was to classify documentation of any UTI sign or symptom–the\ninformation necessary to establish UTI diagnosis–rather than identiﬁcation or enumeration of references\nto speciﬁc signs or symptoms, we elected against over-sampling low-frequency entities in model training;\ndiﬀerent sampling methods may be helpful in other clinical contexts. It should also be noted that EHR\ndocumentation of UTI signs and symptoms may not accurately represent patients’ experiences. Studies\nusing patient surveys[32–34] and audio or video recordings[35, 36] of encounters have shown substan-\ntial discrepancies between patient-reported and physician-documented symptoms or exam ﬁndings. For\nexample, a 2015 cross-sectional study of hospitalized patients with e. Coli bacteriuria found low corre-\nlation between UTI symptoms as reported in patient surveys and documented in emergency physicians’\n(κ,0.09-0.5) and inpatient physicians’ ( κ, 0.06-0.4) EHR notes.[37] While we did not quantify internal con-\nsistency in the notes we annotated, annotators anecdotally noted frequent internal discrepancies between\nsymptom documentation in clinical notes with multiple authors (e.g., a resident physician and attending\nphysician.)\n11\n .

Ulti-\nmately, this and similar models can facilitate accurate, large-scale extraction of UTI-related symptoms from\nunstructured clinical notes in the EHR, paving the way for research and public health surveillance examin-\ning the relationships among UTI signs and symptoms, urinalysis and urine culture results, UTI diagnoses,\nand patient outcomes. Better understanding of these relationships can help create systems that augment\nUTI diagnosis in real time, allowing for appropriately targeted treatment, improving patient outcomes, and\nlimiting iatrogenic harm.\nReferences\n[1] Antibiotic resistance threats in the United States, 2019. 2019.\n[2] Schappert SM, Rechtsteiner EA.
