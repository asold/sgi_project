    "abstract": "Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) of the oil allows transformer fault diagnosis and status monitoring. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering is an effective pattern recognition method, but exhibits poor clustering accuracy for dissolved gas data and usually fails to subsequently correctly classify transformer faults. The existing feasible approach involves combination of the FCM clustering algorithm with other intelligent algorithms, such as neural networks and support vector machines. This method enables good classification; however, the algorithm complexity is greatly increased. In this paper, the FCM clustering algorithm itself is improved and clustering analysis of DGA data is realized. First, the non-monotonicity of the traditional clustering membership function with respect to the sample distance and its several local extrema are discussed, which mainly explain the poor classification accuracy of DGA data clustering. Then, an exponential form of the membership function is proposed to obtain monotony with respect to distance, thereby improving the dissolved gas data clustering. Likewise, a similarity function to determine the degree of membership is derived. Test results for large datasets show that the improved clustering algorithm can be successfully applied for DGA-data-based transformer fault detection.",
