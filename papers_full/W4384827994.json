  "abstract": "Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, has been recognized as one of the most lethal forms of cancer. Detecting and diagnosing skin lesions accurately can be challenging due to the striking similarities between the various types of skin lesions, such as melanoma and nevi, especially when examining the color images of the skin. However, early diagnosis plays a crucial role in saving lives and reducing the burden on medical resources. Consequently, the development of a robust autonomous system for skin cancer classification becomes imperative. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely employed over the past decade to automate cancer diagnosis. Nonetheless, the emergence of the Vision Transformer (ViT) has recently gained a considerable level of popularity in the field and has emerged as a competitive alternative to CNNs. In light of this, the present study proposed an alternative method based on the off-the-shelf ViT for identifying various skin cancer diseases. To evaluate its performance, the proposed method was compared with 11 CNN-based transfer learning methods that have been known to outperform other deep learning techniques that are currently in use. Furthermore, this study addresses the issue of class imbalance within the dataset, a common challenge in skin cancer classification. In addressing this concern, the proposed study leverages the vision transformer and the CNN-based transfer learning models to classify seven distinct types of skin cancers. Through our investigation, we have found that the employment of pre-trained vision transformers achieved an impressive accuracy of 92.14%, surpassing CNN-based transfer learning models across several evaluation metrics for skin cancer diagnosis.",
