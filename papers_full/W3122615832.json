This paper addresses\nthis issue by proposing a new distance protection approach that\ncombines the blocking and unblocking criteria of distance pro‐\ntection based on the values of incomplete differential current,\noperation voltage, and current harmonic content.The proposed\napproach is verified by theoretical analysis,dynamic simulation\ntesting, and field operation to ensure that the obtained distance\nprotection is reliable and refrains from operating unnecessarily\nunder reverse fault-induced CT saturation in the breaker-and-a-\nhalf configuration.Meanwhile, the proposed approach is demon‐\nstrated can operate reliably when forward faults occur or vari‐\nous reverse faults are converted to forward faults.\nIndex Terms——Breaker-and-a-half configuration, current\ntransformer (CT) saturation, distance protection, power fre‐\nquency variation,operation voltage.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nT\nHE operation range and sensitivity of distance protection\nare not directly affected by the operation mode of an\nelectric power transmission system.Therefore, distance pro‐\ntection can satisfy the requirements of modern power systems\nfor rapid fault clearing and hence can be widely used in high-\nvoltage transmission lines[1], [2]. However, the transmission\ncharacteristics of current transformers(CTs) are important fac‐\ntors that affect the dependability of distance protection, partic‐\nularly under secondary current distortion during CT satura‐\ntion [3].\nAccording to the IEC60255-121 standard [3], the effect of\nCT saturation on distance protection can be classified into two\ncategories: dependability loss and security loss.A dependabili‐\nty loss corresponds to a saturation-induced decrease in the cur‐\nrent amplitude and a phase shift,which reduces the actuation\nrange and increases the actuation time of distance protection.\nA security loss corresponds to a distance protection malfunc‐\ntion that arises from a saturation-induced reverse current. Gen‐\nerally, in the case of a single CT connected to protection, dis‐\ntance protection will lose dependability with reduced possibili‐\nty of malfunction owing to a decrease in the secondary cur‐\nrent after CT saturation. Similar conclusions have been drawn\nin the literature[4], [5].\nHowever, according to the IEEE Std C37.110[6], in a ring\nor breaker-and-a-half configuration, the current used for line\nprotection is the sum of the currents of two CTs.When the\nbus fails, a large ride-through current may flow through the\nCT. If the CT is saturated, the total current may present a\nlarge reverse current, and the distance protection will be at the\nrisk of malfunction.\nThe problems associated with distance protection under CT\nsaturation have been addressed in a number of studies.For ex‐\nample, the optimal selection of CTs at key locations in the\ntransmission system has been verified to be effective for re‐\nducing or avoiding the effect of CT saturation on distance pro‐\ntection [6]. However, this complicates the implementation and\napplication range of distance protection. Hence, these prob‐\nlems cannot be resolved completely by depending solely on\nthe optimal selection of CT locations. Other studies have pro‐\nposed the use of new types of CTs such as Rogowski coils or\nelectromagnetic CTs to limit the effect of CT saturation on dis‐\ntance protection [7], [8]. However, these new types of CTs\ncannot be applied in a sufficiently extensive manner to ad‐\ndress these problems owing to issues regarding stability and\neconomic considerations. Furthermore, studies focusing on\nthe malfunction of distance protection during CT saturation\nare rather limited, and most previous studies investigate the\nmalfunction of differential protection during CT saturation, in‐\ncluding some approaches such as the identification approach\nof saturated waveforms [9] - [13] and the compensation ap‐\nproach for saturation current [14] - [17]. In addition, an ap‐\nproach employing directional elements has been proposed to\navoid malfunction[18]. However, the operation conditions un‐\nder which this method is applicable are limited, and malfunc‐\ntions can still occur in special cases.Moreover, distance pro‐\ntection malfunctions in high-voltage transmission lines signifi‐\ncantly affect the power grid,particularly in the ring or breaker-\nand-a-half configuration, and the risk of malfunction during\nManuscript received: October 12, 2019; accepted: July 7, 2020.

ANALYSIS OF DISTANCE PROTECTION MALFUNCTION\nThe mho characteristic is one of the most typically used\ncharacteristics in distance protection[3]. In this study, we per‐\nform an analysis based on an example of mho distance protec‐\ntion [19] of positive-sequence voltage polarization.Based on\nthe phase-comparison principle, the operation equation is ex‐\npressed as:\n90°<arg(U̇\nOP /U̇\nP )<270° (1)\nwhere U̇\nOP =U̇\nm -İ\nm Zset is the operation voltage, and Zset is the\nsetting value of distance protection, U̇\nm and İ\nm are the respec‐\ntive voltage and current obtained by the protection device, re‐\nspectively; and U̇\nP =U̇\nm1 is the polarization voltage, and U̇\nm1\nis the positive-sequence voltage component at the protection\ndevice.\nAccording to an example of a substation system shown in\nFig. 1, the currentİ\nml on the protected lineL1 is the sum of the\nprimary currentsİ\nm1 from CT1and İ\nm2 from CT2.\nAccording to the characteristics of CT transmission, İ\nm1 and\nİ\nm2 can be expressed as[3]:\nİ′m1 =k̇\n1 İ\nm1 (2)\nİ′m2 =k̇\n2 İ\nm2 (3)\nwhere İ′m1 and İ′m2 are the secondary currents from CT1and\nCT2, respectively; and k̇\n1 =Aeϕ. A and ϕ are the changes in the\namplitude and angular difference generated during transmis‐\nsion, respectively. The definition ofk̇\n2 is similar. A virtual CT\nthat outputs the secondary total current can be constructed,\nand according to(2) and (3), the transmission characteristic of\nCT can be expressed as:\nk̇ = İ′sum\nİ\nl\n= İ′m1 +İ′m2\nİ\nm1 +İ\nm2\n= k̇\n1 İ\nm1 +k̇\n2 İ\nm2\nİ\nm1 +İ\nm2\n(4)\nwhere İ\nl is the primary current flowing through the line; and\nİ′sum is the total current flowing to the protection device. For\nsimplicity, the CT1and CT2ratios are assumed to be1. There‐\nfore, k̇\n1 =k̇\n2 =1 during a normal CT transmission.\nThe equivalent system obtained when a fault occurs at\npoint F of lineL2 in Fig.1 is shown in Fig.2, where Ė\nS is the\nsending-end electromotive force;Ė\nR is the receiving-end elec‐\ntromotive force;İ\nF is the fault current flowing from pointF to\npoint K; ZK is the equivalent impedance from pointM to point\nK; and ZR is the equivalent impedance of the protection for‐\nward direction.\nThe parameters in Fig.2 are used to express the operation\nvoltage U̇\nOP and polarization voltageU̇\nP as:\nU̇\nOP =U̇\nm -İ′l Zset =İ\nl Zm -k̇İ\nl Zset =İ\nl (Zm -k̇Zset ) (5)\nU̇\nP =U̇\nm1 =Ė\nR +İ\nl1 ZR =-İ\nl (ZR -Zm )+İ\nl1 ZR =\nİ\nl [Zm -ZR (1-İ\nl1 /İ\nl )]=İ\nl (Zm -k′ZR ) (6)\nwhere Zm is the resistance between the protection device and\nthe short-circuit point;İ\nl1 is the positive-sequence component\nof İ\nl; and k′=1-İ\nl1 /İ\nl, which is related to the fault type and\nsystem parameter. For example, with a single-phase earth\nfault, k′=0.75-0.87; with a phase-phase fault, k′=0.5; and\nwith a three-phase fault, k′=0.\nSubstituting (5) and (6) into (1) yields\n90°<arg Zm -k̇Zset\nZm -k′ZR\n<270° (7)\nThe operation characteristic corresponding to(7) is a circle\nwith end points ofk̇Zset and k′ZR as the diameter.

By contrast, when CT1\nis under normal transmission and CT2is under severe satura‐\ntion, k̇\n1 =1, whereas the amplitude ofk̇\n2 is reduced and be‐\ncomes zero [6]. This condition is illustrated in Fig. 3(b),\nwhere k̇ =İ′m1 /İ\nl owing to the opposite directions ofİ′m1 and İ\nl,\n*\n *\n*\n1\nm\nI\n2\nm\nI\nml\nI\nM\nN\n1\nL\n2\nL\nP\nF\n1BRK\n2BRK\n3BRK\n4BRK\n5BRK\n1CT\n2CT\n Circuit breaker (closed)\n.\n.\n.\nFig. 1.

Equivalent system with reverse fault at pointF in Fig.1.\n69\nJOURNAL OF MODERN POWER SYSTEMS AND CLEAN ENERGY, VOL. 9, NO. 1, January 2021\nand the action circle corresponding to(7) shifts to quadrant\nIII. Therefore, distance protection may malfunction when a\nshort-circuit fault occurs at the far-end point or the opposite\nbus.\nThe system illustrated in Fig.1 presents a special operation\ncondition, denoted as operation condition 1, when BRK4 is\ndisconnected with a reverse fault at pointF so that the same\ncurrent flows through CT1and CT2,and İ\nl is zero.The condi‐\ntion where CT2 is severely saturated is illustrated in Fig.4,\nwhere the total currentİ′sum from the CT output presents a con‐\nsistent positive-direction characteristic with respect toİ′m1. Sub‐\nsequently, k̇ is in quadrant III,and the amplitude approaches\ninfinity. Herein, the action circle corresponding to(7) extends\ninfinitely to quadrant III,and the possibility of a reverse-fault-\ninduced malfunction arises.\nFault currents flowing through the branch CT may differ\nsignificantly, thereby resulting in the saturation of one of the\nCTs. For the fault illustrated in Fig.1 and analyzed above,the\nfault currents from busM and line L1 flowing through CT2\nare easily saturated. Moreover, the directional characteristics\nof the total current are affected by CT2saturation. Namely,\nthe total current moves gradually in the forward direction as\nthe extent of CT2saturation increases, thereby increasing the\nprobability of distance protection malfunction. Furthermore, a\nsimilar situation occurs with the fault at pointFb, as shown in\nFig. 5(b). Hence, both the fault position and CT saturation ex‐\ntent are the factors that affect the distance protection malfunc‐\ntion.\nAdditional short-circuit states are illustrated in Fig. 5(a)\nand (b), which represent a fault at the near-end pointFa along\nthe forward direction of the line and a fault at pointFb on the\nreverse bus, respectively. Figure 5(a) shows that, when the\nfault occurs at pointFa, variations Dİ\nm1 and Dİ\nm2 of the current\nflowing through CT1and CT2 are reversed, i.e., they are in\nthe same direction. Figure 5(b) shows that when the fault oc‐\ncurs at pointFb, Dİ\nm1 is forward andDİ\nm2 is reverse, i.e., the\ntwo are in opposite directions. These two short-circuit states\nare analyzed in much greater detail in the following section.\nHowever, the fault at pointFb shown in Fig.5(b) is similar to\nthe fault illustrated in Fig.1 and that analyzed previously.\nTo summarize, distance protection is at the risk of malfunc‐\ntion in the case of reverse-fault-induced CT saturation in the\nbreaker-and-a-half configuration and will malfunction under\nparticular operation modes.In addition, the fault location and\nextent of CT saturation are the factors affecting the distance\nprotection malfunction.\nIII.

The criteria can identify the\nfault direction during CT saturation [3] and can implement\ndistance protection for a forward fault while blocking distance\nprotection for a reverse fault. In the far-end reverse line fault\n(Fig. 5(b)), the blocking criterion is not subject to false block‐\ning. In addition, the amplitudes ofDİ\nm1 and Dİ\nm2 are high for\nthe near-end metallic fault, and the directional characteristics\nare conspicuous.Hence, the criteria exhibit greater sensitivity.\nHowever, a small fault current arising under fault conditions\nsuch as a far-end fault or near-end fault with transition resis‐\ntance may induce CT saturation under residual CT magne‐\ntism. Under these conditions, the directional characteristics of\nDİ\nm1 and Dİ\nm2 are not conspicuous and hence the criteria may\nbe invalid. This can be analyzed based on the system illustrat‐\ned in Fig.6, where the two transmission lines from busM are\ninstalled on the same tower. When BRK3is open,which is de‐\nfined as operation condition2, a short-circuit fault occurs at\nthe end of the line or on the busN, and Dİ\nm2 may be extreme‐\nly small. At this point, DIcd »DIzd, and the blocking criterion\noperates to halt the implementation of distance protection.\nThese problems are addressed by the proposed operation volt‐\nage criteria.\nB. Operation Voltage Criteria\nThe operation voltage variationDU̇\nop is defined as:\nDU̇\nop =DU̇\nm -Dİ\nm ZL (10)\nwhere ZL is the impedance of the entire transmission line; and\nDU̇\nm and Dİ\nm are the voltage and current variations at the pro‐\ntection device, respectively. This can be defined in cases of\nforward and reverse faults as follows.\nFor the forward fault,\nDU̇\nm =-Dİ\nm ZS (11)\nwhere ZS is the equivalent positive-sequence impedance of the\npower system behind the protection device. Substituting (11)\ninto (10), we can obtain\nDU̇\nop =-Dİ\nm (ZS +Zset ) (12)\nThe voltage variation at fault pointF is defined as:\nDU̇\nf =Dİ\nm (ZS +ZF ) (13)\nwhere ZF is the positive-sequence impedance from the short-\ncircuit pointF to the protection device. The forward fault is il‐\nlustrated by the potential diagram of the voltage variation, as\nshown in Fig.7(a). Accordingly, the condition|DU̇\nop |>|DU̇\nm |\nmust hold along the entire transmission line during a short cir‐\ncuit in the forward direction.\nFor a reverse fault,\nDU̇\nm =Dİ\nm ZR (14)\nwhere ZR is the equivalent positive-sequence impedance of\nthe protection forward direction. Substituting (14) into (10),\nwe can obtain\nDU̇\nop =Dİ\nm (ZR -ZL ) (15)\nThe voltage variation at fault pointF is expressed as:\nDU̇\nf =-Dİ\nm (ZR +ZF ) (16)\nThe reverse fault is illustrated by the potential diagram of\nthe voltage variation, as shown in Fig.7(b). Accordingly, the\ncondition |DU̇\nop |<|DU̇\nm | must be met during a reverse short\ncircuit.\nBased on the above analysis,different relationships involv‐\ning DU̇\nop and DU̇\nm are employed to set unblocking and block‐\ning criteria of the operation voltage during positive and re‐\n∆\n∆\n*\n *\n*\n1\nm\nI\n2\nm\nI\nM\nN\n1\nL\n2\nL\nF\n1BRK\n2BRK\n3BRK\n4BRK\n5BRK\nCircuit breaker (closed)\nCircuit breaker (open)\n.\n.\nFig. 6.

Similar to(8), the thresh‐\nold value Usetdif is also set to reduce the effect of disturbance\nin the system on the criterion. The values ofDU̇\nm and Dİ\nm are\nobtained using the short data window algorithm[20], [21].\nUnder normal operation conditions, the criteria can identify\nthe fault direction during CT saturation[3] and then imple‐\nment distance protection for a forward fault while blocking\ndistance protection for a reverse fault. Details regarding the\napplication of the operation voltage criteria under the two op‐\neration conditions are provided as follows.\nUnder operation condition1, the total current obtained by\nthe protection is zero during a reverse bus fault. At this time,\n|DU̇\nop |= |DU̇\nm |, and the blocking criterion of(18) is invalid.\nDuring the forward fault, |DU̇\nop | is significantly greater than\n|DU̇\nm |; hence, the value of k cannot impair the judgment of\nthe unblocking criterion. Under this operation condition, the\nincomplete differential blocking criterion operates correctly\nand exhibits greater sensitivity than the operation voltage\nblocking criterion.\nUnder operation condition2, the incomplete differential cri‐\nterion is invalid during a fault at the remote end of the line.\nHowever, the operation voltage unblocking criterion operates\ncorrectly and exhibits greater sensitivity than the incomplete\ndifferential unblocking criterion.\nThe above analysis demonstrates the necessity of utilizing\nboth the incomplete differential and operation voltage criteria\nto address special conditions where a single set of criteria is\nnot applicable.\nC. Logic Coordination Between Incomplete Differential and\nOperation Voltage Criteria\nThe action conditions of the incomplete differential and\noperation voltage criteria at various fault points under differ‐\nent system conditions are shown in Table I,where P\n1, P2,\nand P3 denote the fault points at the near-end line, far-end\nline, and opposite bus,respectively.\nThe following conclusions can be obtained from Table I.\n1) Under operation condition1, the operation voltage block‐\ning criterion is always activated regardless of the fault type,\nwhereas the operation voltage unblocking criterion is never ac‐\ntivated, and the incomplete differential action criteria are acti‐\nvated normally.\n2) Under operation condition2, the incomplete differential\nblocking criterion is activated in the fault atP3, whereas the\nincomplete differential unblocking criterion is not activated,\nand the operation voltage criteria are activated normally.\n3) Under general operation conditions, both the incomplete\ndifferential and operation voltage criteria are activated normally.\nAccordingly, valid distance protection blocking actions are\nassured by applying an“and” logic to the criteria of the in‐\ncomplete differential blocking and the operation voltage\nblocking, whereas valid distance protection unblocking ac‐\ntions are assured by applying an“or” logic to the criteria of\nthe incomplete differential unblocking and operation voltage\nunblocking. Hence, the criteria provide a strict account of the\nfault direction under all operation conditions. The criteria are\nactivated according to the characteristics of the linear trans‐\nmission area of the CT prior to its saturation. Consequently, a\nlogical interlock between the blocking and unblocking criteria\nis used to avoid the effect of current distortion on criteria deci‐\nsions after CT saturation, as shown in Fig.8, and the continu‐\nity of the criteria can be maintained during CT saturation.\nD. Criteria for Current Harmonic Content Unblocking\nWhen a reverse fault is converted to a forward fault, the dis‐\ntance protection blocking criteria act first and maintain the ac‐\ntion, resulting in a failure to unblock distance protection after\nconversion to the forward fault. This problem is addressed in\nthe present study by establishing unblocking criteria based on\nthe current harmonic content.\nTABLE I\nACTION CONDITION OF INCOMPLETE DIFFERENTIAL AND OPERATION VOLTAGE CRITERIA\nCondition\nCondition 1\nCondition 2\nGeneral\nFault point\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP1\nP2\nP3\nIncomplete differential\nblocking criterion\nAction\nNo action\nNo action\nAction\nNo action\nAction\nAction\nNo action\nNo action\nIncomplete differential\nunblocking criterion\nNo action\nAction\nAction\nNo action\nAction\nNo action\nNo action\nAction\nAction\nOperation voltage\nblocking criterion\nAction\nAction\nAction\nAction\nNo action\nNo action\nAction\nNo action\nNo action\nOperation voltage\nunblocking criterion\nNo action\nNo action\nNo action\nNo action\nAction\nAction\nNo action\nAction\nAction\n72\nZHENG et al.:TRANSMISSION LINE DISTANCE PROTECTION UNDER CURRENT TRANSFORMER SATURATION\nThe high second harmonic content of the output current is\nthe key feature of CT saturation[19], [22], [23]. Accordingly,\nCT saturation can be assumed to be relieved when the second\nharmonic content of the output current is less than a threshold\nvalue, enabling distance protection to be unblocked. The pro‐\nposed current harmonic content unblocking criteria are ex‐\npressed as:\nì\ní\nî\nïï\nïï\nImh2 <kH Im\nIm1h2 <kH Im1\nIm2h2 <kH Im2\n(19)\nwhere Imh2, Im1h2, and Im2h2 are the secondary harmonic con‐\ntents of the total current, side circuit breaker current, and mid‐\ndle circuit breaker current, respectively; Im, Im1, and Im2 are the\ntotal current, side circuit breaker current, and middle circuit\nbreaker current, respectively; and kH is the harmonic content\nratio coefficient, which is set as0.15 based on the literature\n[22]-[24] and a large number of simulation tests.\nDuring a reverse fault, distance protection is blocked, and\nthe output current is monitored according to the criteria in\n(19) simultaneously. If CT saturation is relieved and the re‐\nverse fault is converted to a forward fault, the harmonic con‐\ntents will be less than the threshold values,and distance pro‐\ntection will be unblocked. During forward-fault-induced CT\nsaturation, the action characteristics of distance protection are\naffected by distortions in the current, and the protection trip\ntime will be extended or the protection range will be reduced\n[4]. Meanwhile, the action characteristics cannot be restored\nuntil CT saturation has subsided to a certain extent or com‐\npletely relieved. Therefore, the full-cycle Fourier algorithm is\nused to implement a criterion that has a short time delay, and the\ncriterion can be unblocked in time with limited effect on the ac‐\ntion characteristics of the distance protection.\nIV. S\nIMULATION ANALYSIS\nA. Simulation System Parameter\nFigure 9 presents the dual-circuit simulation model built in\nthe Real Time Digital Simulator(RTDS) and employed for\nanalysis. It is a typical model operating at500 kV, where the\nsame tower adopts the breaker-and-a-half configurationat one\nside and the dual-bus configuration at the other side.Internal\nfault pointsF1-F3 and external fault pointsF4 and F5 are estab‐\nlished in the model to simulate various fault types.The system\nimpedance and line parameters are listed in Table II.\nTwo protection devices, denoted as A and B,are employed\nin the simulations at theM side of lineL1. Device A is devel‐\noped based on the proposed method, and device B is devel‐\noped using the conventional distance protection strategy. De‐\nvice A measures the respective output currents of CT1and\nCT2, whereas device B measures the total current. Both devic‐\nes comprise two-stage distance protections based on themho\nrelay, which is defined in(1). The value ofZset of distance relay\nzone I is22.11 Ω, whereas it is set to be33.16 Ωfor the distance\nrelay zone II,and the time delay is set to be0.5 s.\nB. Simulation Result\nDynamic simulations are conducted to verify the perfor‐\nmance of the protection devices with forward and reverse me‐\ntallic faults and different operation modes.The simulation re‐\nsults are listed in Table III.The results indicate that both de‐\nvices A and B provide consistent operation characteristics of\ndistance protection under general operation conditions as well\nas forward and reverse faults.Hence, the proposed approach\ndoes not affect the original operation characteristics of dis‐\ntance protection.\nThe fault recording results of device A in a fault atF\n1 are\nshown in Fig.10(a) to illustrate the criterion features obtained\nduring a forward fault. After the fault occurs,the criteria of\nthe incomplete differential unblocking and operation voltage\nunblocking are satisfied rapidly, and distance protection is un‐\nblocked.

Furthermore, the results verify the feasibility of\nthe current harmonic content unblocking criteria, which exhib‐\nit action features similar to those of the conventional method.\nDynamic simulations are conducted for reverse single-\nphase metallic ground faults and a fault through transition re‐\nsistance at F4 under different saturation degrees of CT1and\nCT2.

By contrast,device B is subject to malfunction.\nMoreover, the blocking criteria of device A still have a greater\nsensitivity compared with the single blocking criterion of de‐\nvice B in the case of involving a fault through transition resis‐\ntance. Additionally, the criteria provide a smaller fault current\nas well as reliable distance protection blocking.\nThe fault recording results of device A in a fault atF\n4 when\nCT1 is saturated are shown in Fig.11.

Meanwhile, de‐\nvice B is subject to malfunction. Hence, these results verify\nthat the combination of the incomplete differential and opera‐\ntion voltage criteria addresses the problems associated with\nsingle-criterion approaches under special operation condi‐\ntions. In addition, the correct criterion action is ensured under\nall operation conditions.\nOver 10000 protection devices based on the proposed ap‐\nproach have been used in power grids of various voltage lev‐\nels in China,and all of the field protection devices are operat‐\ning as intended.\nV. C\nONCLUSION\nThis paper addresses the tendency of conventional transmis‐\nsion line distance protection approaches to malfunction under\nreverse fault-induced CT saturation by proposing a new dis‐\ntance protection approach. The approach combines the criteria\nof distance protection blocking and unblocking based on the\ncriteria of incomplete differential current, operation voltage,\nand current harmonic content. The mechanism of distance pro‐\ntection malfunction during reverse fault-induced CT satura‐\ntion is analyzed for the breaker-and-a-half configuration as an\nexample. The results of dynamic simulation testing and field\noperation verify that the proposed approach guarantees reli‐\nable distance protection and the intended operation during for‐\nward faults and reverse fault-induced CT saturation that lasts\nlonger than 2 ms. In general, the proposed approach does not\naffect the accuracy and speed of distance protection. More‐\nover, the application of current harmonic content criteria en‐\nables the implementation of distance protection after a reverse\nfault is converted to a forward fault. Consequently, the reli‐\nability of distance protection is improved, and a higher practi‐\ncal engineering value is obtained. Ring or breaker-and-a-half\nconfigurations are typically used in domestic and foreign high-\nvoltage power grids;hence, the promotion and application of\nthe proposed approach will improve the reliability of power\ntransmission line protection and enhance the safe operation of\npower grids.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] Z.
