We used data from the UK Biobank Cohort, a major biomedical database in the UK, and the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), a large-scale prospective study in Korea, for additional validation and multi-institutional research. These databases provided a wide array of information including age, sex, medical history, lipid profile, blood pressure, and physical measurement. Based on these data, we generated language sentences for individual analysis and input these into the LLM to derive results. The performance of the LLMs was then compared with the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), a conventional risk prediction model, using this real-world data. We confirmed the model performance of both the LLMs and FRS, evaluating their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and F1 score. Their performance in predicting 10-year cardiovascular risk was compared through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox-hazard ratio analysis.

The accurate and timely prediction of an individual’s risk of developing CVD can \nfacilitate early intervention and prevention strategies, which reduces the incidence and impact of \nCVD\n2. Although conventional CVD risk prediction models, such as the Framingham risk score \n(FRS)3, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled \nCohort Equations4, and the QRISK3 score5 provide insights into population-level risk factors and \nhave been widely adopted in clinical practice, these models have several limitations. First, these \nmodels have limited generalizability to diverse populations with varying demographic, clinical, \nand genetic characteristics6. Second, conventional models may not incorporate novel risk factors \nor consider complex interactions between risk factors, leading to potential underestimation or \nrisk overestimation7. Third, the implementation of conventional risk models can be challenging \nbecause of complex calculations and variable requirements, which hinders their use in clinical \nsettings8. Finally, these risk models do not have adequate personalization and rely on population-\nlevel data, which may not accurately capture individual-level variations in risk factors. This \nphenomenon limits their ability to provide tailored risk assessments for patients\n9. \nAdvances in artificial intelligence (AI) can overcome these limitations10. Large language models \n(LLMs), particularly the generative pretrained transformer 4 (GPT-4) model developed by \nOpenAI, exhibit remarkable proficiency in producing human-like languages, and have potential \nfor application in other industries\n11,12. However, despite their growing popularity, reliability \nconcerns severely affect the use of LLMs in the medical field, which requires precise and \naccurate information. A potential problem with LLMs is “AI hallucination.” This phenomenon \n .

(which was not certified by peer review)\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 24, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.22.23289842doi: medRxiv preprint \n \noccurs when AI confidently generates an impressive-sounding response that may not be justified \nby its training data or may even be factually incorrect13. The presence of AI hallucinations raises \nreliability and accuracy concerns on information produced by these models, particularly in \ndomains such as medicine, which requires precise and trustworthy information. Although such \nproblems have been reduced in GPT4\n12,14, only a few studies have quantified or analyzed this \ntopic. \nAlthough the use of language models in the medical field has attracted considerable attention, \nlimited quantitative evaluation of their performance and accuracy has been conducted in specific \nmedical tasks\n15. Therefore, we evaluated LLMs in predicting CVD risk for 10 years and \ncompared their performance with that of conventional risk prediction models using UK Biobank \nand Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) data16,17. \n \nMethods \nData source and outcome assessment \nWe used data from the UK Biobank cohort, a large-scale biomedical database of UK general \npopulation. Established in 2006, the UK Biobank cohort is one of major international health \nresources that has collected extensive data and biological samples from approximately 500,000 \nparticipants aged between 40 and 69 years at the time of assessment. We used the UK Biobank \ndatabase to extract data pertaining to age, sex, diabetes diagnosed by a doctor, blood pressure \nmedication, smoking status, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low \ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) direct, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, \nstanding height, weight, date of attending the assessment center, and date of death \n .

We excluded cases with any missing values among these variables, \nexcept death date and ethnicity. After exclusion, 10,000 individuals were selected through \nrandom sampling. Additionally, individuals who previously experienced major cardiovascular \nadverse events (MACE) were excluded from the study (Fig. 1). \nThe FRS was originally developed for predicting coronary heart disease (CHD) but has since \nbeen evolved for use in forecasting not only CHD but also cerebrovascular disease, peripheral \nartery disease (PAD), and heart failure (HF)\n3. Using this approach, we assessed patient outcomes \nusing MACE, which represents the most fatal and predominant occurrence of CVD. MACE is \ndefined as follows: it was defined by the earliest recorded event of myocardial infarction \n(International Classification of Diseases [ICD]9 codes 410, 411·0, 412, 429·79, or ICD10 codes \nI21, I22, I23, I24.1, I25.2 or UK Biobank Self Report field 20002 codes 1075) or ischemic stroke \n(ICD9 codes 434, 436 or ICD10 codes I63, I64 or UK Biobank Self Report field 20002 codes \n1583)\n18. The outcome was obtained through a category called an algorithmically defined \noutcome, which included information on the likely instances of specific health issues, derived \nfrom the algorithmic integration of coded data from the UK Biobank’s initial assessment data \ncompilation (incorporating data from participants regarding their self-reported medical \nconditions, surgeries, and medications), in conjunction with associated data from hospital \nadmissions (diagnoses and procedures) and death records. \nIn addition to the UK Biobank dataset, we used KoGES data as an additional validation cohort. \nThe KoGES is a large-scale prospective study designed to investigate the genetic and \nenvironmental factors contributing to chronic diseases in the Korean population\n16. We used \nbaseline data from the KoGES cohort collected between 2001 and 2002 to extract variables \nanalogous to those used in the UK Biobank. These variables included age, sex, diagnosis of \n .

LDL levels \nwere calculated based on total cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride levels (Supplementary Table 2). \nIn this cohort, we defined patients as those who experienced a disease event (myocardial \ninfarction or cerebrovascular disease) at least once during the 10-year follow up, resulting in 176 \npatients. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria on KoGES population selection are described \nin Supplementary figure 1. \n \nCardiovascular risk calculation—the conventional score (Framingham Risk Score, FRS) \nThe FRS is a widely recognized and well-established algorithm that is used to estimate an \nindividual’s 10-year risk of developing CVD.\n3 This score considered various factors, including \nage, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and diabetes. The details are listed in \nSupplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2. In this study, we used the FRS to calculate \nthe cardiovascular risk percentage for each individual. Based on these percentages, we classified \ntheir risks into distinct categories (low, moderate, or high) to facilitate a comprehensive \nunderstanding of their potential for developing CVD. \n \nCardiovascular risk calculation—LLMs (GPT-3 ·5/GPT-4/bard) \nTo predict the incidence of CVDs using LLMs (ChatGPT and Bard), we reformatted the \nvariables into a sentence structure, as detailed in Fig. 2, prior to feeding them into LLMs. The \ndecision to use this conversion was based on the inherent language model nature of LLMs. This \napproach allowed us to specify our output to represent individual risk percentages rather than \nextensive text narratives. Furthermore, the approach enabled the systematic classification of risk \n .

Information on each \nparticipant (age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking status, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, \nHDL cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass \nindex [BMI, calculated from height and weight]) was provided to the LLMs, and the 10-year \nCVD risk percentage was extracted using regular expressions from the corresponding answers. \nBased on the 10-year CVD risk percentage, 10% or less was classified as low risk, 10%–20% as \nmoderate risk, and > 20% as high risk. \nFor GPT-3·5, we used the OpenAI ChatGPT API (GPT-3.5-turbo, March 23 version) in a Python \nenvironment to streamline the extraction of results. However, in the cases of GPT-4 and Bard, \nthe lack of open-source APIs comparable to GPT-3·5 necessitated an alternative approach. GPT-\n4 and Bard enable accounts operating in online environments to iteratively input data and \ngenerate output text for each new chat instance. \n \nModel comparison between scoring systems \nIn the proposed methodology, the statistical significance of ChatGPT-3·5, ChatGPT-4, Bard, and \nFRS was investigated by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients. This numerical measure \nwas used to assess the linearity between the output of these models and the observed data, \nproviding an indication of both the strength and direction of these relationships. \n \nPerformance evaluation \nTo assess the performance of each model, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive \npredictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score. Sensitivity details the \nability of the model to correctly identify true-positive cases, whereas specificity evaluates the \n .

PPV represents the proportion of true-\npositive cases among predicted positives, whereas NPV denotes the proportion of true-negative \ncases among predicted negatives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of sensitivity and PPV, \nwhich provides a single metric for model performance, particularly in situations with imbalanced \nclass distributions. \n \nLLM model performance using limited information \nTo evaluate the robustness of the LLMs in an environment where all input data cannot be \ninvestigated, we conducted additional experiments by constructing prompts using limited \ninformation and then querying GPT-3·5 with the UK Biobank cohort. This evaluation involved \nthe use of an-omitting section, in which particular categories of patient data were excluded from \nthe existing prompt. In the first experiment, data related to patient history (history of diabetes, \nblood pressure medication, and smoking) were excluded. In the second experiment, the data \nrelated to lipid profiles (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) \nwere excluded. In the third experiment, data related to physical measurements (blood pressure \nand BMI) were excluded. These defined groupings are the foundation for analyzing the model \nperformance under various conditions. \n \nStatistical analysis \nTo assess the statistical significance of differences in baseline characteristics among the risk \ngroups, first, we performed a normality test using the Shapiro–Wilk method. After determining \nthat our data did not satisfy the conditions of normality, we proceeded with nonparametric tests. \nWe used the chi-squared test and Kruskal–Wallis test.

Here, P-value < 0·05 was considered as significant in all tests. \nThe Kaplan–Meier method was applied to plot survival curves for the low-, moderate-, and high-\nrisk groups based on 10-year mortality data from the UK Biobank. Furthermore, we used the \nCox proportional hazards model to compare the survival function associated with MACE within \neach risk group in both the LLMs and FRS. The predictors in the model were the risk categories \n(low, moderate, and high) derived from the scoring systems, with the low-risk group used as a \nreference. \n \nResults \nThe UK Biobank study included 502,396 participants aged 40–69 years at the time of assessment, \nrecruited between 2006 and 2010 (Fig. 1). A total of 103,817 participants with missing data were \nexcluded. Of the remaining participants, after randomly selecting 10,000 participants, 274 \npatients who had previously experienced MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular events) were \nexcluded, leaving 9726 subjects for the analysis. \n \nTable 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the participants and the cardiovascular risk scores \nderived from the LLMs when grouped by GPT-4 category. Among a total of 9726 individuals for \nanalysis, the participants had an overall median age of 58 years (IQR 50–63) with 4359 (44·8%) \nmen and 331 (3·4%) experienced MACE within 10 years. When grouped by the GPT-4 category, \n4222 individuals were classified as low-risk, 3957 as moderate risk, and 1547 as high risk. The \nhigher-risk group had older individuals, a higher proportion of men, higher incidence of 10-year \n .

The 10-year MACE \nperformance prediction for people classified as high risk in each scoring system were detailed. In \nthe UK Biobank cohort, theGPT-4 score had the highest accuracy of 0·834, specificity of 0·849, \nPPV of 0·084, and F1 score of 0·849, 0·084, and 0·138, respectively. The GPT-3·5 score had the \nhighest sensitivity (0·598) and NPV (0·980). Overall, the performance of the GPT-4 score was \ncomparable to that of the Framingham risk score, whereas the Bard score exhibited the worst \nperformance. In the KoGES cohort, the GPT-4 score had the highest accuracy of 0·902 and \nspecificity of 0·926.

The findings of this \nstudy are as follows. GPT-4 achieved performance comparable to the FRS in cardiovascular risk \nprediction in both the UK Biobank {accuracy (0·834 vs· 0·773) and F1 score (0·138 vs· 0·132)} \nand KoGES {accuracy (0·902 vs· 0·874)}. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of GPT-4 \ndemonstrated distinct survival patterns among groups, which revealed a strong association \nbetween the GPT risk prediction output and survival outcomes. The additional analysis of limited \nvariables using GPT-3·5 indicated that ChatGPT’s prediction performance was preserved despite \nthe omission of a few variables in the prompt, especially without physical measurement data \n(Table 4).  \n \n .

In some cases, ChatGPT \nhas outperformed existing prediction models, encouraging studies on the potential of ChatGPT \nfor use in various applications\n11. For instance, in the financial sector, compared with \nconventional analysis methods, ChatGPT has demonstrated superior performance in predicting \nstock prices\n19. However, limited studies have been conducted on the use of language models in \nhealthcare. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal that ChatGPT exhibited \nperformance comparable with the conventional risk score model in predicting cardiovascular risk \nusing large real-world medical data. These findings provide insights into the potential \napplicability of ChatGPT in medical practice. \nDespite being a language-generation model, ChatGPT exhibits performance similar to the \nconventional model in predicting the cardiovascular risk of patients. Conventional prediction \nalgorithms typically rely on multivariate regression of well-established CVD risk factors\n3,4, \ntypically limiting the number of risk factors and assuming linear relationships between them with \nminimal or no interaction between various factors20. By contrast, ChatGPT, which derives its \nanswers by learning from large amounts of textual datasets to generate the most probable human-\nlike responses rather than through mathematical calculations, achieves similar values and \nperformances as linear computation-based regression models. Furthermore, conventional models \nfrequently rely on old cohorts and have only been validated for specific cohort groups within \nindividual countries, which limit their applicability to a broad population\n21. Furthermore, widely \nused calculators for renowned models such as the FRS have slightly distinct formulas based on \ndifferent references, which results in heterogeneous prediction methods\n22–24. By contrast, \n . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseIt is made available under a \n is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review)\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 24, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.22.23289842doi: medRxiv preprint \n \nChatGPT can learn from multiple guidelines and select the most suitable guideline for prediction, \nwhich enhances its generalizability across a diverse population. ChatGPT has achieved \nsatisfactory performance in the UK Biobank, Western database, KoGES, and Asian database, \nwhich highlights the generalizability and robustness of the model in diverse populations. \nChatGPT provides improved accessibility and flexibility compared with conventional prediction \nmodels. Users can easily access ChatGPT by visiting a website, without requiring any particular \napplication. The model rapidly delivered satisfactory outcomes without strict input constraints by \naccepting numerous input formats. ChatGPT can understand the context and range of the input \nvalues, even when precise units are not provided\n25. Unlike conventional prediction models, \nChatGPT provides answers with limited input data. Because ChatGPT is a model that learns \nexisting texts and derives results from them, cardiovascular risk can be determined from existing \ntext data that may not contain the patient’s blood test results, medical history, or physical \nmeasurements. Therefore, unlike existing models, GPT can train any combination of variables \nand produce outputs through various types of input combinations. Furthermore, by estimating \nrisks without requiring physical measurements such as height, weight, or systolic blood pressure \ndata, ChatGPT predictions could potentially decrease hospital visits, enhance convenience, and \npromote advancements in telemedicine.\n \nConventional risk-stratification guidelines tend to be complex and require precise numerical \nvalues for each risk stratification, rendering the guidelines unsuitable for use in brief outpatient \nsettings. However, with ChatGPT, users can request outputs in a specific format, which allows \nfaster interpretation of medical records. For instance, users can rapidly access only the necessary \ninformation by asking ChatGPT to provide a patient’s cardiovascular risk score, utilized \nguidelines, and corresponding risk group.\n \n .

Consequently, this approach facilitates the monitoring of CVD risk in a larger \npopulation, which promotes earlier interventions and management of at-risk patients. \nMoreover, the features of ChatGPT observed in this study have considerable implications in both \nclinical practice and research. ChatGPT can enable the semantic extraction of targets of interest. \nThe operational definitions for determining the study subjects vary across institutions and \nstudies\n26. Therefore, selecting patients with consistent meanings from various institutions using \nconventional methods is challenging given the discrepancies in data formats and meanings. \nHowever, ChatGPT can function independently of data formats and adherence to standards. Thus, \nby converting existing data into text, semantically extracting the patients of interest becomes \nfeasible. This approach facilitated the integration and analysis of disparate data from multiple \ninstitutions. For example, by leveraging the findings of this study, individuals with specific \nlevels of cardiovascular risk can be promptly identified.\n \n \nFinally, this study has a few limitations. First, the unavailability of API for GPT-4 and Bard \nlimited our analysis to a subset of 10,000 UK Biobank participants. However, this result was \nsufficient to validate the findings of this study. Second, the inner workings of GPT-4 remain \nchallenging because the model and the code of ChatGPT have not been fully disclosed, and \n .

Third, the performance of GPT-4 is yet to be extensively validated for various medical \nconditions, necessitating additional research to generalize our findings to other conditions such \nas diabetes or cancer. Studies are required to optimize the performance of GPT-4 through fine-\ntuning and prompt engineering of specific tasks.\n \n \nLLMs, such as ChatGPT, can achieve performance comparable to conventional models in \npredicting cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, ChatGPT exhibits enhanced accessibility, flexibility, \nand ability to provide user-friendly outputs. With the continuous evolution of LLMs, such as \nChatGPT, future studies should focus on applying the models to various medical scenarios and \noptimizing their performance. \n \nContributors \nConceptualization: SungA Bae,  \nMethodology: Dukyong Yoon,  \nValidation: Seng Chan You,  \nInvestigation: Changho Han, Dong Won Kim, Songsoo Kim,  \nWriting—original draft preparation: Changho Han, Dong Won Kim, Songsoo Kim,  \nWriting—review and editing: Dukyong Yoon, SungA Bae, Seng Chan You,  \nSupervision: Dukyong Yoon, SungA Bae\n \n .
