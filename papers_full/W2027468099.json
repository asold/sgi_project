All these members of Diptera belong to the suborder Brachycera. In this\nwork, it is reported the isolation and characterisation of genestransformer-2 of the dipteransSciara ocellaris and\nBradysia coprophila (formerly Sciara coprophila), which belong to the much less extensively analysedSciaridae\nFamily of the Suborder Nematocera, which is paraphyletic with respect to Suborder Brachycera.\nResults: The transformer-2 genes of the studiedSciara species were found to be transcribed in both sexes during\ndevelopment and adult life, in both the soma and germ lines. They produced a single primary transcript, which\nfollows the same alternative splicing in both sexes, giving rise to different mRNAs isoforms. InS. ocellaris the most\nabundant mRNA isoform encoded a full-length protein of 251 amino acids, while that ofB. coprophila encoded a\nprotein of 246 amino acids. Both showed the features of the SR protein family. The less significant mRNA isoforms\nof both species encoded truncated, presumably non-functional Transformer-2 proteins. The comparison of the\nfunctional Sciara Transformer-2 proteins among themselves and those of other insects revealed the greatest\ndegree of conservation in the RRM domain and linker region. In contrast, the RS1 and RS2 domains showed\nextensive variation with respect to their number of amino acids and their arginine-serine (RS) dipeptide content.\nThe expression ofS. ocellaris Transformer-2 protein inDrosophila XX pseudomales lacking the endogenous\ntransformer-2 function caused their partial feminisation.\nConclusions: The transformer-2genes of bothSciaridae species encode a single protein in both sexes that shares the\ncharacteristics of the Transformer-2 proteins of other insects. These proteins showed conserved sex-determination\nfunction inDrosophila; i.e., they were able to form a complex with the endogenousDrosophila Transformer protein that\ncontrols the female-specific splicing of theDrosophila doublesexpre-mRNA. However, it appears that the complex formed\nbetween theDrosophila Transformer protein and theSciara Transformer-2 protein is less effective at inducing the female-\nspecific splicing of the endogenousDrosophila doublesexpre-mRNA than theDrosophilaTransformer-Transformer2\ncomplex. This suggests the existence of species-specific co-evolution of the Transformer and Transformer-2 proteins.\nBackground\nSex determination refers to the developmental pro-\ngramme that commits the embryo to following either the\nmale or the female pathway. Recent years have seen a\ngreat amount of interest in the evolution of developmen-\ntal mechanisms at the genetic and molecular levels, and\nin determining the evolutionary processes by which these\nmechanisms came into existence. Given the great variety\nof sex determination mechanisms, this process is excep-\ntionally suitable for comparative study. Indeed, sex deter-\nmination has long been of major interest not only as a\ndevelopmental process but also because of the evolution-\na r yp r o b l e mi tp o s e s-ap r o b l e mt h a tc a no n l yb es o l v e d\nby identifying and comparing the genetic structures of\nsex determination pathways. Molecular genetic technolo-\ngies now allow such comparisons to be made.

The product of a gene\ncontrols the sex-specific splicing of the pre-mRNA from\nthe downstream gene in the genetic cascade.Sex-lethal\n(Sxl) is at the top of this cascade and acts as the mem-\nory device for female sexual development via its auto-\nregulatory function: its product controls the splicing of\nits own pre-mRNA [2,3]. In addition, Sxl controls the\nsplicing of the pre-mRNA from the downstream gene\ntransformer (tra) [4-6]. The Tra product and the pro-\nduct of the constitutive genetransformer-2 (tra-2) con-\ntrol the sex-specific splicing of pre-mRNA from the\ngene doublesex (dsx) [7-10], which is transcribed in both\ns e x e sb u tg i v e sr i s et ot w od i f f e r e n tp r o t e i n s ,D s x Fa n d\nDsxM [11,12]. These are transcription factors that\nimpose female and male sexual development respectively\nvia the sex-specific regulation of the so-called sexual\ncytodifferentiation genes.\nGenes homologous to the sex determination genes of\nD. melanogaster have been sought in other insects\n(reviewed in [13-15]). In the sciarid flies, which belong\nto the dipteran suborder Nematocera, only the ortholo-\ngues of geneSxl have been characterised inSciara ocel-\nlaris [16], Bradysia coprophila, Rynchosciara americana\nand Trichosia pubescens [17]. The Sxl gene of these spe-\ncies is not regulated in a sex-specific fashion, and there-\nfore the sameSxl transcript encoding the functional Sxl\nprotein is found in both males and females. Thus, in the\nsciarids, Sxl does not appear to play the key discriminat-\ning role in sex determination that it plays inDrosophila.\nApart from in D. melanogaster ,t h eg e n etra-2 has\nbeen studied in D. virilis [18], and has been charac-\nterised in the housefly Musca domestica [19], in the\ntephritid Ceratitis capitata [20,21], in twelveAnastrepha\nspecies [22], and in the calliphoridLucilia cuprina [23].\nOutside the dipterans, tra-2 has been isolated in the\nlepidopteron Bombyx mori [24]. In all cases tra-2 is\ntranscribed in both sexes during development, produ-\ncing the same protein in males and females. The injec-\ntion of Musca tra-2 dsRNA into Musca embryos results\nin the complete transformation of genotypically female\nembryos into fertile adult males, highlighting the role of\ntra-2 in Musca sex determination. This gene is required\nfor the female-specific splicing of Musca dsx pre-\nmRNA. It also participates in the autocatalytic activity\nof gene F [19], i.e., theMusca tra orthologous gene [25],\nthe key sex-determining gene in the housefly [26]. The\ninjection of the respective tra2- dsRNA into Ceratitis\n[21] and Anastrepha [22] results in the destruction of\nen\ndogenous tra-2 function in both species and the\nsubsequent male-specific splicing of the endogenoustra\nand dsx pre-mRNAs, leading to the transformation of\ngenotypically female embryo s into adult pseudomales.\nThis highlights the role of tra-2 in Ceratitis and Ana-\nstrepha sex determination.\nThe present paper reports the isolation and characteri-\nsation of tra-2 of S. ocellaris and B. coprophila (formerly\nSciara coprophila). Their Tra2 proteins were compared\nto other known insect Tra2 proteins and the effect of\nSciara tra-2 on Drosophila sex determination analysed.\nResults and discussion\nMolecular organisation oftra-2 in S. ocellaris and B.\ncoprophila\nThe first step in the isolation of the S. ocellaris tra-2\ngene (Sotra2 )w a st op e r f o r mR T - P C Ro nt o t a lR N A\nfrom adults. Reverse transcription was performed using\nthe primer oligo-dT, while t wo-nested PCR reactions\nwere performed with three degenerated primers: Mar17,\nMar26 and Tra2.B (the location and the sequences of\nthe primers used in this work are shown in Additional\nfile 1). The first PCR reaction was performed using the\nprimer pair Mar26 plus Mar17, the second using Mar26\nplus Tra2.B. An amplicon of 133 bp was amplified,\ncloned and sequenced. The conceptual amino acid\nsequence of this amplicon showed a high degree of simi-\nlarity with the 3 ’ region of the RRM domain of the\nD. melanogaster Tra2 protein, indicating that a fragment\nof the putative SoTra2 protein had been isolated.\nNested PCR reactions were then performed in 3’ and 5’\nRACE analyses. The amplicons were then cloned and\nsequenced. A GenomeWalker library forS. ocellaris was\nthen synthesised and used to perform PCR genome-walk-\ning on the genomic DNA ofS. ocellaris from the initial\namplicon towards the 5’ and 3’ directions. The genomic\namplicons were cloned and sequenced. The sequences of\nthe genomic fragments thus generated were compared\nwith the cDNA sequences previously determined. In this\nway, the exon/intron junctions were unambiguously iden-\ntified. Figure 1A shows the molecular organisation of\nSotra2. Its transcription unit was made up of 4601 bp and\nwas composed of six exons and five introns (Figure 1A).\nThe transcription start site was located 94 bp upstream of\nthe translation initiation codon.\nOverlapping PCR on total RNA of S. ocellaris males\nand females showed that the gene Sotra2 mainly pro-\nduced the transcript Sotra2-251 ,f o r m e db ye x o n sE 1 -\nE2-E3-E4b-E5-E6 (1177 bp). This encoded a full-length\nputative Tra2 protein of 251 amino acids that included\nthe RS1, RS2 and RRM domains characteristic of the\nTra2 proteins. Two other less abundant transcripts were\nalso detected: Sotra2-204 and Sotra2-130 (Figure 1A)\n(see Methods). The Sotra2-204 transcript differed from\nSotra2-251 in its lack of exon 3, and it encoded a\nMartín et al.

The latter carries translation\nstop codons causing the production of a truncated Tra2\nprotein 130 amino acids long and lacking both the RRM\nand RS2 domains.\nTo isolate the genetra-2 of B. coprophila (Bctra2), the\nsame strategy used for the isolation of this gene in\nS. ocellaris was followed, except that the initial step\ninvolved PCR amplification of the genomic DNA of\nadults using primers expSoT2.1 and expSoT2.2 , corre-\nsponding to exons 5 and 6 ofSotra2 . A genomic frag-\nment of 1069 bp was amplified, cloned and sequenced.\nIts sequence showed 61% similarity to the corresponding\nregion of Sotra2, suggesting that a genomic fragment of\nBctra2 had been cloned. As forSotra2,5 ’RACE, 3’RACE\nand genome-walking methodologies were used to deter-\nmine the molecular organisation of Bctra2 (Figure 1B).\nI t st r a n s c r i p t i o nu n i tw a sm a d eu po f4 2 5 5b pa n dw a s\ncomposed of six exons and five introns.\nOverlapping PCR performed on total RNA of males\nand females of B. coprophila showed that the gene\nBctra2 mainly produced the transcript Bctra2-246 ,\nformed by exons E1-E2-E3-E4b-E5-E6 (1444 bp). This\nencoded a full putative Tra2 protein of 246 amino acids\nand included the RS1, RS2 and RRM domains character-\ni s t i co fT r a 2p r o t e i n s .T h r ee other less abundant tran-\nscripts were also detected: Bctra2-203 , Bctra2-99 and\nBctra2-75 (Figure 1B) (see Methods). The Bctra2-203\ntranscript differed fromBctra2-246 in its lack of exon 3;\nit encoded a putative Tra2 protein of 203 amino acids.\nThe Bctra2-99 transcript varied from Bctra2-246 by the\ninclusion of exon E4a, which carries translation stop\ncodons. Thus, it produced a truncated Tra2 protein of\n99 amino acids that lacked both the RRM and RS2\ndomains. Finally, the Bctra2-75 transcript, made up by\nexons E1, E2 and E6, encoded a truncated Tra2 protein\nwith short RS1, RRM and RS2 domains.\nExpression pattern oftra-2 in S. ocellaris and B. coprophila\nThe expression of tra2 in S. ocellaris was studied by\nperforming RT-PCR on total RNA from a mixture of\nmale plus female embryos, from a mixture of male plus\nfemale larvae at different developmental stages, from the\nheads plus thoraces of male and female adults (sepa-\nrately), from the abdomens of male and female adults\n(separately), and from adult ovaries and testis (sepa-\nrately). The expression of tra2 in B. coprophila was\nsimilarly analysed, although in this case it was possible\nto distinguish male from female embryos as well as\nmale from female larvae (see Methods). The primers\nused were expSoT2.1 from exon 5 andexpSoT2.2 from\nexon 6 (Figure 2A), which have the same sequence in\nboth Sciara species. The expression of the constitutive\ngene rpL10, which encodes the ribosomal protein L10,\nw a su s e da sac o n t r o li nR T - P C R .I na l lc a s e s ,af r a g -\nment of 273 bp was amplified (Figure 2B,C). This was\ncloned and sequenced, confirming that it corresponded\nto the expected Sotra2 or Bctra2 fragment. Negative\ncontrols in all these PCR reactions produced no ampli-\ncons (see Methods). These results indicate that the\ngenes Sotra2 and Bctra2 are expressed at all develop-\nmental stages and during adult life in both sexes, includ-\ning in the gonads of males and females.\nComparison of the molecular organisation ofSciara tra-2\ngene with that of other insects\nThe gene tra-2 of D. melanogaster gives rise to three\nmRNAs by alternative splicing pathways and alternative\npromoters, which encode three distinct isoforms of the\nTra2 protein [27,28]. InB. mori, tra-2 produces six dif-\nferent transcripts by alternative splicing pathways, which\nencode six distinct isoforms of the Tra2 protein [24]. In\nthe case of other dipterans such asC. capitata [20,21],\nAnastrepha species [22], M. domestica [19] and\nL. cuprina [23], only a singletra-2 mRNA was detected.\nFigure 3 compares the molecular organisation ofSciara\ntra-2 with tra-2 of Drosophila, Ceratitis, Musca and\nBombyx. The number of exons varies: six inSciara, seven\nin Drosophila ,e i g h ti nCeratitis and Musca, and nine in\nBombyx .I n Sciara , all the exon/intron junctions agree\nwith the consensus GT/AG. These joints are found in the\nsame position inS. ocellaris and B. coprophila. Similarly,\nthe connection between exons 5 and 6 is in the same\nposition in all these species. The RS1 and RRM domains\nof the putative Tra2 proteins are encoded by the exons\nE2-E4 and exons E5-E6 respectively in all species. How-\never, the RS2 domain is encoded by exon E6 inSciara,b y\nexons E6-E7 inDrosophila, by exons E6b-E7 inCeratitis,\nby exons E6-E7 inMusca,a n db ye x o n sE 7 - E 8i nBom-\nbyx.T h eg e n etra-2 has a single promoter except in\nDrosophila, which carries two promoters.\nComparison of the Tra2 protein ofSciara with that of\nother insects\nThe conceptual translation of the Sotra2-251 and\nBctra2-246 mRNAs showed them to encode a polypep-\ntide with the main structural features characteristic of\nthe SR protein family, i.e ., the RNA-binding motif\n(RRM) and two RS-domains. These are rich in serine-\narginine dipeptides and confer upon these proteins the\ncapacity to interact with others.\nThe putative Tra2 protein of the dipteransS. ocellaris\nand B. coprophila (Sciaridae, suborder Nematocera)\nwere compared to those of the dipterans belonging to\nthe suborder Brachycera, i.e., D. melanogaster (Droso-\nphilidae),C .c a p i t a t a(Tephritidae), M. domestica\nMartín et al.

Figure 4 shows their align-\nment. The number of amino acids in these Tra2 pro-\nteins varied: S. ocellaris 251, B. coprophila 246,\nD. melanogaster 264, C. capitata 251, M. domestica 232,\nL. cuprina 271, and B. mori 274. These differences are\ndue to changes throughout the Tra2 protein except in\nthe RRM domain and the linker region (72 and 19\namino acids respectively) in all these species. The high-\nest degree of similarity (measured as identical plus con-\nserved amino acids) to S. ocellaris was shown by\nB. coprophila (86%) (as expected for species belonging\nFigure 2Expression of tra-2 of S. ocellaris and B. coprophila.

The highest degree of similarity was\nobserved in the RRM (55.5-94.4%) and the linker region\n(68.4-100%). In fact, the linker region is a signature\nmotif of Tra2 proteins [29]. This conservation agrees\nwith the fundamental role of RRM in the function of\nthe Tra-Tra2 complex, conferring upon the complex its\ncapacity to interact with the tra and dsx pre-mRNAs\nand thus regulate its sex-specific splicing. The similarity\nof the RS1 (21.8-87.6%) and RS2 (28.2-81.6%) domains\nwas lower and a variable number of SR dipeptides were\nseen, ranging from 11 to 18 for RS1 and 3 to 6 for RS2.\nVariation in the content of RS dipeptides seems to be a\nfeature of the SR proteins whenever they are maintained\nenough to preserve their function [30].\nFigure 3Comparison of the molecular organisation oftra-2 of S. ocellaris, B. coprophila, D. melanogaster, C. capitata, M. domesticaand\nB. mori.

An imperative of this technique is\nto have markers that allow one to determine whether\nmale survivors really do correspond to XX females that\nhave been transformed into pseudomales by the destruc-\ntion of the endogenous tra-2 gene function, or to nor-\nmal XY males. In the case of the insects mentioned\nabove, this distinction was possible thanks to the exis-\ntence of molecular markers located on the Y chromo-\nsome [19,21] and to the different morphology of the X\nand Y chromosomes [22]. However, the lack of molecu-\nlar makers, plus the fact thatSciara females are XX and\nmales are X0, together with the extreme fragility of their\ntiny eggs, makes this RNAi procedure unfeasible for\nthese insects at the present time. Thus, direct proof of\nt h er o l eo ftra-2 in Sciara sex determination remains\nelusive.\nNotwithstanding, we were able to study whether the\nSciara Tra2 protein shows conserved sex-determination\nfunction in Drosophila. The rationale of the experiment\nwas to express transgenic SoTra2 protein inDrosophila\nXX pseudomales lacking the tra-2 gene function and\nchecked whether these pseudomales showed feminisa-\ntion. The GAL4-UAS system was used to analyse the\neffect of theSciara tra-2 gene in Drosophila.\nThe systemic expression of SoTra2 with the ubiqui-\ntous-expression da-GAL4 or hs-GAL4 drivers was found\nto be lethal to both male and female flies. The same\nlethality has been observed in Drosophila males and\nfemales that ectopically express their own Tra2 protein\n[31]. Therefore, thern-GAL4 local expression driver was\nused. This driver expresses GAL4 in agreement with the\nexpression domain of the gene rotund (rn) ,w h i c hi s\nexpressed in the tarsal region of the foreleg imaginal\ndisc [32], a well-characterised sexually dimorphic region\nof Drosophila. For details of the experimental design see\nMethods.\nFigure 5 shows the effect of expressing the SoTra2\nprotein on the sexually dimorphic development of the\nforeleg basitarsus in XX pseudomales and in their\nbrother XY males, both mutant for tra-2 and carrying\nSotra2-UAS , rn-GAL4 and Tub-GAL80\nts.T h ef o r e l e g\nbasitarsus contained several transversal rows, the last\none forming the sex comb structure (SC) in males and\nin XX pseudomales mutants fortra-2. This is composed\nof dark, thick bristles, and is rotated to lie parallel to the\nproximal-distal leg axis (Figure 5C). Females lack the sex\ncomb (Figure 5B). A significant reduction (P < 0.0001,\none-way ANOVA) was seen in the number of bristles\nforming the male sex comb structure in the foreleg basi-\ntarsus of XX pseudomales raised at 25°C (expressing the\nSoTra2 protein) (see Figure 5D and the enlargement in\nFigure 5E) compared to those raised at 18°C (no expres-\nsion of the SoTra2 protein) (see Figure 5C). The sex\ncomb size of these latter pseudomales was the same as\nthe sex comb of their XY brothers whether raised at 18\nor 25°C (Figure 5A). Thus, theSciara Tra-2 protein sup-\nplies tra-2 function in Drosophila.\nThis reversion of the male towards the female pheno-\ntype of the foreleg basitarsus in XX pseudomales mutant\nfor tra-2 and expressing the SoTra2 protein is probably\ncaused by the presence of the endogenous Drosophila\nDsxF protein. As mentioned in the Introduction, the\nTra-Tra2 complex controls the female-specific splicing\nof the dsx pre-mRNA. If theSciara Tra2 protein is cap-\nable of forming a complex with the endogenousDroso-\nphila Tra protein, then this complex could bind to\nspecific sequences in the female-specific exon of dsx\npre-mRNA. This would promote its inclusion in mature\ndsxF mRNA, which encodes the DsxF protein that\nestablishes female development. This expectation was\nconfirmed at the molecular level.\nThe effect ofSciara Tra2 protein on the splicing con-\ntrol of Drosophila dsx pre-mRNA was studied in trans-\ngenic Drosophila XX flies mutant for tra-2 and\nexpressing the Sciara Tra2 protein (Figure 6). The indu-\ncible hs-GAL4 driver was used to express the Sotra2\ntransgene. XX pseudomalesyw/w; Df(2R)trix,tra-2[-]/tra-\n2\nB; Sotra2/hs-GAL4 were produced at 25°C (see cross in\nthe legend to Figure 6). After the hatching of the adults\nthe flies were divided into two populations; one was\nmaintained at 25°C (control flies) and one subjected to\nheat-shock pulses (experimental flies) to induce the\nexpression of the Sotra2 transgene. Total RNA was\nextracted and used in RT-PCR to determine the splicing\npattern of the endogenousdsx primary transcript. rp49,\nwhich codes for the constitutive ribosomal protein 49\n[33], was used as an RT-PCR control. At 25°C, the four\ntransgenic lines only expressed the maledsx mRNA iso-\nform (data not shown); this was to be expected since\nthey lack the endogenous tra-2 function and do not\nexpress theSotra2 transgene. After the heat shocks, how-\never, these transgenic lines expressed the female dsx\nmRNA isoform (Figure 6B). Two amplicons were\ndetected. The smaller one (646 bp) corresponded to the\nfemale dsxF mRNA. The larger amplicon (758 bp) was to\nbe expected if the intron 3 were retained (Figure 6A,B).\nThe cloning and sequencing of both fragments confirmed\nthese suppositions. These results were not the conse-\nquence of the heat-shocks since their brothers (malesyw/\nY; Df(2R)trix,tra2[-]/tra-2\nB; Sotra2/hs-GAL4) expressing\nthe Sotra2 transgene did not express the female dsx\nMartín et al. BMC Developmental Biology2011, 11:19\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/19\nPage 8 of 13\nmRNA isoform (Figure 6C). Negative controls for all\nthese PCR reactions produced no amplicons (see Meth-\nods). Thus, the Sciara Tra2 protein is able to promote\nthe female-specific splicing of the Drosophila dsx pre-\nmRNA.\nWhereas the expression ofSciara Tra2 protein in the\nXX pseudomales produced their feminisation, its expres-\nsion in their XY normal brothers mutant fortra-2 did\nnot affect their normal male development. This different\neffect is explained by the presence of Tra protein in the\nXX pseudomales and its absence in XY normal males.\nThe Drosophila Tra protein seems to lack an RNA bind-\ning domain, thus its influence in female development is\nexerted at the level of its interaction (via SR domains)\nwith other proteins carrying RNA-binding domains,\nsuch as Tra2 (reviewed in [34]). Therefore, the Sciara\nTra2 protein would form a complex with the endogen-\nous Drosophila Tra protein to promote the female-\nspecific splicing of theDrosophila dsx pre-mRNA.\nThe feminisation produced by theSciara Tra2 protein\nwas, however, partial, indicating that the function of this\nprotein in Drosophila was incomplete. There are two\npossible explanations for this. It might be due to an\ninsufficient quantity of Sciara Tra2 protein being pro-\nduced in theDrosophila transgenic flies; it was necessary\nto restrict the amount of Sciara Tra2 protein that was\nexpressed since the production of any greater amount is\nlethal. However, although this possibility cannot be\nrejected outright it seems unlikely sinceDrosophila XX\nflies with a single dose of tra-2 develop as normal\nfemales; i.e., a single dose of the endogenoustra-2 gene\nsupplies enough Drosophila Tra2 protein for normal\nfemale development to be followed. Alternatively, the\ninteraction between the endogenous Drosophila Tra\nprotein and the transgenicSciara Tra2 protein might be\naffected such that the Drosophila Tra-Sciara Tra2 com-\nplex is less efficient than theDrosophila Tra-Tra2 com-\nplex at inducing the female-specific splicing of the\nendogenous Drosophila dsx pre-mRNA. This explana-\ntion agrees with the presence of the aberrant spliced\ndsxF mRNA isoform in XX pseudomales expressing the\nSciara Tra2 protein in addition to the normally spliced\ndsxF mRNA. Note that this isoform contains intron 3,\nthe target where the Tra-Tra2 complex binds to pro-\nmote its inclusion into mature dsxF mRNA [7-10].\nFurther, the retention of intron 3 does not appear to be\nthe consequence of any general trouble in the splicing\nof dsx pre-mRNA since intron 2 (and probably also\nintron 1) is normally spliced.\nThis aberrant dsxF mRNA isoform has been also\nfound in Drosophila XX pseudomales mutant for the\nendogenous tra gene and expressing theAnastrepha Tra\nprotein, whereas Dro sophila XX flies with different\nFigure 5 Effect of the Sciara tra-2 gene on the somatic\ndevelopment of Drosophila.

Thi s divergence was mainly\nobserved in the RS domains, which are involved in pro-\ntein-protein interactions. Hence, the interaction between\nthe Sciara Tra2 protein and theDrosophila Tra protein\nmight be impeded as a consequence of changes accumu-\nlated in these proteins after theSciara and Drosophila\nphylogenetic lineages separated. These results suggest\nthat Tra and Tra2 proteins co-evolved to exert their\nfunctions in sex determination. To this respect, it is\nworth mentioning that theD. virilis tra-2 gene can fully\nreplace the endogenous tra-2 function of D. melanoga-\nster for normal female sexual development [18]. The\nsimilarity between the D. melanogaster and D. virilis\nTra-2 proteins is 51,5% [22], whereas the similarity\nbetween the D. melanogaster and S. ocellaris Tra-2 pro-\nteins is 36.3% [this work].\nConclusions\nThe transformer-2 genes of both Sciaridae species\nencode a single protein in both sexes that shares the\ncharacteristics of the Tran sformer-2 proteins of other\ninsects. These proteins showed conserved sex-determi-\nnation function in Drosophila ; i.e., they were able to\nform a complex with the endogenousDrosophila Trans-\nformer protein that controls the female-specific splicing\nof the Drosophila doublesex pre-mRNA. However, it\nappears that the complex formed between the Droso-\nphila Transformer protein and theSciara Transformer-\n2 protein is less effective at inducing the female-specific\nsplicing of the endogenous Drosophila doublesex pre-\nmRNA than the Drosophila Transformer-Transformer2\ncomplex. This suggests the existence of species-specific\nco-evolution of the Trans former and Transformer-2\nproteins.\nMethods\nFlies and crosses\nSciarid flies were raised on“Compost Villacasa” medium\nfor culturing mushrooms.S. ocellaris is a digenic species\nso that females produce both sexes, whereas B. copro-\nphila is a monogenic species with two types of females:\ngynogenic females, which produce only females, and\nandrogenic females, which produce only males.\nDrosophila flies were cultured on standard food. For\nthe description of the mutant alleles and GAL4 con-\nstructs see Lindsley and Zimm [36] and FlyBase. Flies\nused for the analysis of the adult forelegs were kept in a\nmixture of ethanol:glycerol (3:1) for several days. They\nwere then macerated in 10% KOH at 60°C for 15 min,\nthoroughly washed with water, and mounted in Faure’s\nsolution for inspection under a compound microscope.\nExperimental design to analyse the effect of the gene\ntra-2 of Sciara on the somatic sexual development of\nDrosophila\nAs mentioned in the text, the systemic expression of\nSoTra2 with the ubiquitous-expression da-GAL4 or\nhs-GAL4 drivers was found to be lethal to both male\nand female flies. Therefore, the rn-GAL4 local expres-\nsion driver was used. Nevertheless, it was necessary to\nfind out the experimental conditions that allowed us to\nstudy the effect of the gene tra-2 of Sciara on the\nsomatic sexual development of Drosophila.T h e rn-\nGAL4 driver expresses GAL4 in agreement with the\nexpression domain of the gene rotund (rn) [32]. This\ngene is expressed in imaginal discs as well as in the\nembryonic and larval central nervous systems (CNS)\n[32]. The expression of rn in the tarsal region of the\nforeleg imaginal disc commences during the early third\nlarval instar, but is no longer evident in the late third\ninstar [32]. This methodology has been used to ablate\nthe sex comb inDrosophila males expressing the Trans-\nformer protein under the rn-GAL4 driver [37]. The\nexpression of Sotra2 by the rn-GAL4 driver was also\nlethal to both males and females. This might be due to\nthe expression of Sotra2 in the embryonic and/or larval\nCNS, as mentioned above. To prevent embryonic lethal-\nity a strategy was followed that allowed the temporal\ncontrol of Sotra2 expression under the rn-GAL4 driver\nduring development. For this purpose the GAL4/GAL80\nsystem was used. The GAL80 protein inhibits GAL4\nfunction. GAL80 is temperature sensitive, with 18°C the\nmost permissive temperature and 29°C the most restric-\ntive [38]. Drosophila XX pseudomales mutant for tra-2\nand carrying Sotra-2-UAS together with rn-GAL4 and\nTub-GAL80\nts were produced. The cross producing these\npseudomales was performed at 18°C, and several two-\ndays egg collections were made. Three days later each\ncollection was transferred to 29°C environment. By this\ntime the larvae had hatched,which were maintained at\nthis temperature for the rest of their development. This\ntreatment eliminated the embryonic lethality caused by\nthe expression of the SoTra2 protein; at 18°C theUAS-\nSotra2 transgen is not expressed since the GAL4 protein\nfrom the rn-GAL4 driver is not functional due to the\nfunction of GAL80\nts protein. However, the expression of\nSotra2 during the larval stage could not be prevented\nsince at 29°C this transgene is expressed due to the\ninactivation of the GAL80\nts protein. Even under these\nconditions, the males and females expressing the SoTra2\nprotein were lethally affected, probably because of an\nexcess of this transgenic protein affecting the\nMartín et al. BMC Developmental Biology2011, 11:19\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/19\nPage 11 of 13\ndevelopment of the larval CNS. Finally, we took advan-\ntage of the fact that at 25°C the GAL80ts protein retains\nsome function [38]. It was reasoned that if XX pseudo-\nmales mutant for tra-2 and carrying Sotra-2-UAS , rn-\nGAL4 and Tub-GAL80\nts can develop at that tempera-\nture, the GAL4 from the rn-GAL4 driver ought not to\nbe completely inhibited. Consequently a certain amount\nof SoTra2 protein ought to be produced (less than at\n29°C) but which might not be lethal. Thus, these pseu-\ndomales might be able to survive to adulthood. This was\nthe case.\nMolecular analyses\nGenomic DNA was extracted from frozen specimens as\ndescribed in Maniatis et al. [39]. Total RNA from adult\nfemale ovaries, adult male testis, embryos, larvae, and\nadult male and female somatic cells was prepared using\nthe Ultraspec-II RNA isolation kit (Biotecx) following the\nmanufacturer ’s instructions. Five micrograms of total\nRNA from each sample were reverse transcribed with\nSuperscript (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’ s\ninstructions. Reverse transcription reactions were per-\nformed with an oligo-dT. Two percent of the synthesised\ncDNA was amplified by PCR. All amplicons were ana-\nlysed by electrophoresis in agarose gels, cloned using the\nTOPO TA-cloning kit (Invitrogen) or PGEM-T vector\n(Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and\nsequenced. In all cases, PCR reactions with RNA samples\nwere performed to guarantee there was no contamination\nwith genomic DNA (negative controls of PCR reactions).\nThe relative abundance of distinct mRNA isoforms was\ninferred from the different intensity of their correspond-\ning amplicons in the agarose gels showing the products\nof the RT-PCR reactions. In some cases, the amplicons\nwere not clearly visible in the gel.\nThe GenomeWalker genomic libraries of S. ocellaris\nand B. coprophila were synthesised using the BD Geno-\nmeWalker Universal kit (BD Biosciences), following the\nmanufacturer’s instructions.\nFor the construction of theSotra2 transgene, the tra-2\nORF of S. ocellaris was amplified by RT-PCR. The PCR\nreaction was performed using primers 5’ SoT2 and\n3’SoT2. The resulting amplicon was cloned in pUAST.\nThe microinjections for generating the TDSo (UAS::\nSotra-2 cDNA) transgenic D. melanogaster lines were\nperformed by Genetic Services (Sudbury, MA, USA). To\nascertain that each transgenic line was carrying the cor-\nrect transgene, PCR on genomic DNA was used to\na m p l i f yt h ew h o l et r a n s g e n e. The amplicons were then\ncloned and sequenced.\nDNA sequencing\nSequencing was performed using an automated 377\nDNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
