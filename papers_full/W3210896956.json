  "abstract": "This report forms part of IEA-SHC Task 41: Solar Energy and Architecture, specifically Subtask B: Methods and Tools for Solar Design.After a literature review of former studies made between 1993 and 2011, the international survey Design Process for Solar Architecture, conducted in 2010 within Task 41 is presented and analyzed.Professionals in 14 countries were contacted and questioned about their use of digital tools for solar design and related themes, such as, barriers for the use of digital tools or their design process.In addition, general data concerning the firm (size, type of buildings) and personal facts (age, experience, profession) was collected.The response rate was less than hoped; nevertheless, this report points out that there is a high awareness of the importance of solar energy use in buildings, but that there are still a number of barriers to the widespread application of digital tools during the design process.The survey affirms results of former investigations by others presented in literature review that widely accepted solar design software packages adequate for use by architects in the early design phase are still lacking.The identification of opportunities and obstacles, special requirements expressed by professionals and suggestions for improvements will help formulate the next program of work, which will involve the development of guidelines for both professionals and software tool developers in order to support design methods and enhance the use of solar energy in building projects.",
