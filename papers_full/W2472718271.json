    "abstract": "The damping characteristics of machine tool support system has a great influence on the rocking vibration amplitude. In our previous study, a system for machine tool support has been proposed to increase damping without decreasing stiffness. In this study, proposed damper system is applied to various machine tools. Results indicate that the damper is effective for machines larger than the machine that is already applied. However, the damping coefficient can be different between applied machines even with the same damper contact area and preload. This suggests a possible confounding factor that should be considered when determining the damping coefficient.",
