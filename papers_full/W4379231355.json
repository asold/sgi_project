    "abstract": "Background and aims: Patients frequently have concerns about their disease and find it challenging to obtain accurate Information. OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot (ChatGPT) is a new large language model developed to provide answers to a wide range of questions in various fields. Our aim is to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in answering patients’ questions regarding gastrointestinal health. Methods: To evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in answering patients’ questions, we used a representative sample of 110 real-life questions. The answers provided by ChatGPT were rated in consensus by three experienced gastroenterologists. The accuracy, clarity, and efficacy of the answers provided by ChatGPT were assessed. Results: ChatGPT was able to provide accurate and clear answers to patients’ questions in some cases, but not in others. For questions about treatments, the average accuracy, clarity, and efficacy scores (1 to 5) were 3.9 ± 0.8, 3.9 ± 0.9, and 3.3 ± 0.9, respectively. For symptoms questions, the average accuracy, clarity, and efficacy scores were 3.4 ± 0.8, 3.7 ± 0.7, and 3.2 ± 0.7, respectively. For diagnostic test questions, the average accuracy, clarity, and efficacy scores were 3.7 ± 1.7, 3.7 ± 1.8, and 3.5 ± 1.7, respectively. Conclusions: While ChatGPT has potential as a source of information, further development is needed. The quality of information is contingent upon the quality of the online information provided. These findings may be useful for healthcare providers and patients alike in understanding the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT.",
