    "abstract": "The rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds immense promise for healthcare, particularly in medication guidance and adverse drug reaction prediction. Despite their potential, existing LLMs face challenges in dealing with complex polypharmacy scenarios and often grapple with data lag issues. To address these limitations, we introduce an LLM-based Chinese medication guidance system, called ShennongMGS, specifically tailored for robust medication guidance and adverse drug reaction predictions. Our system transforms multi-source heterogeneous medication information into a knowledge graph and employs a two-stage training strategy to construct a specialized LLM (ShennongGPT). This method enables the simulation of professional pharmacists’ decision-making processes and incorporates the capability for knowledge self-updating, thereby significantly enhancing drug safety and the overall quality of medical services. Rigorously evaluated by medical professionals and artificial intelligence experts, our method demonstrates superiority, outperforming existing general and specialized LLMs in performance.",
