    "abstract": "In recent years, social networks have changed the way people communicate, while the dissemination and obtaining of information has become fast and convenient. However, it is a double-edged sword, providing both a breeding ground for disinformation and a medium for its rapid dissemination. Meanwhile, falsehoods are proliferating and becoming a global risk, and deepfake technology makes it harder to discern. Therefore, this paper proposed a large language model-based algorithm to detect disinformation with generated videos and photos, which enhances the ability to discriminate fake news by implanting alignment and task specific instructions on the Llama model. Eventually, the result indicated that the proposed method has the potential to achieve superior performance and aligned with people's judgment of things. Furthermore, the paper delves into practical discussions concerning fine-tuning the model within the constraints of limited computational power, highlighting the challenges and potential solutions in optimizing the algorithm for applications.",
