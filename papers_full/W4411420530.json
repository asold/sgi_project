    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a central approach to enhance the factual consistency and domain specificity of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external context at inference time. However, most existing RAG systems rely on dense vector-based similarity, which fails to capture complex semantic structures, relational dependencies, and multimodal content. In this paper, we introduce Graph Codes—a matrix-based encoding of Multimedia Feature Graphs—as an alternative retrieval paradigm. Graph Codes preserve semantic topology by explicitly encoding entities and their typed relationships from multimodal documents, enabling structure-aware and interpretable retrieval. We evaluate our system in two domains: multimodal scene understanding (200 annotated image-question pairs) and clinical question answering (150 real-world medical queries with 10,000 structured knowledge snippets). Results show that our method outperforms dense retrieval baselines in precision (+9–15%), reduces hallucination rates by over 30%, and yields higher expert-rated answer quality. Theoretically, this work demonstrates that symbolic similarity over typed semantic graphs provides a more faithful alignment mechanism than latent embeddings. Practically, it enables interpretable, modality-agnostic retrieval pipelines deployable in high-stakes domains such as medicine or law. We conclude that Graph Code-based RAG bridges the gap between structured knowledge representation and neural generation, offering a robust and explainable alternative to existing approaches.",
