Recently, LLMs have sparked a surge of interest within\nthe domain of Recommender Systems (RS). Various research efforts\nhave been devoted to harnessing LLMs to augment traditional rec-\nommendation models, serving as encoders for user/item features or\nas supplementary knowledge bases [23, 24, 49, 50]. To fully exploit\nthe reasoning ability of LLMs in RS, another line of research is\nto directly prompt or fine-tune LLMs to function as specialized\nrecommenders. Owing to their inherent semantic reasoning capa-\nbilities, these LLM-based recommendation methods have achieved\nimpressive performance. For instance, as shown in Table 1, the\nrepresentative model BIGRec [3] has demonstrated approximately\narXiv:2405.00338v3  [cs.IR]  20 Aug 2024\nRecSys ’24, October 14–18, 2024, Bari, Italy Cui et al.\n41.44% improvements on average over the state-of-the-art conven-\ntional sequential model ( i.e., DROS [75]) on the typical Amazon\nGames and Toys datasets.\nDespite their effectiveness, LLM-based recommenders face se-\nrious inference inefficiency issues, posing substantial challenges\nto their practical applications. For example, as Table 1 shows, the\nwidely used LLaMA2-7B model requires an astonishing three hours\nto perform a single inference for tens of thousands of users with\n4x A800 GPUs. This inefficiency is exacerbated when scaling up\nto serve millions of users concurrently in practical industrial RS,\nwhere responses are required within seconds. This motivates a\ncrucial research question: how can we maintain low inference la-\ntency as conventional recommenders while leveraging the excellent\nperformance of LLM-based recommenders?\nTo tackle this challenge, we propose employing knowledge dis-\ntillation (KD) for acceleration — i.e., distilling the knowledge from\na complex LLM-based recommendation model (teacher) to a light-\nweight conventional recommendation model (student). KD has been\nsuccessfully applied in many domains [2, 8, 22], and has been proven\neffective in transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller\none. This strategy could capitalize on the effectiveness of LLM-\nbased recommenders while maintaining low inference costs. It also\npotentially integrates the capabilities of conventional models in cap-\nturing collaborative signals with the semantic reasoning prowess\nof LLMs. While the ideal is promising, distillation is non-trivial due\nto the fundamentally different mechanisms between the teacher\nand student models. LLMs primarily rely on content understanding\nand capturing semantic correlations for making recommendations,\nwhereas conventional models depend on collaborative signals de-\nrived from users’ historical behaviors. This divergence introduces\nseveral challenges:\n1) Teacher Knowledge Reliability: LLM-based models may\nnot consistently outperform conventional models in all cases. Our\nempirical studies suggest that in over 30% of cases, a conventional\nmodel could even outperform an LLM-based model, indicating that\nthe knowledge from the teacher is not always reliable. Moreover,\nthe LLM may encounter the issue of notorious hallucination and\ngenerate poor recommendations.\n2) Model Capacity Gap: As demonstrated by recent work on KD\n[13], the substantial difference in model size often makes it difficult\nfor the student to assimilate the teacher’s knowledge. Given the\nsimple architecture of the conventional models, they may struggle\nto fully inherit the semantic reasoning ability of the teacher, and\noverloading the student with teacher knowledge might impair its\nown ability in collaborative filtering.\n3) Semantic Space Divergence: Aligning embeddings for distil-\nlation, which has been demonstrated effective, presents significant\nchallenges for this problem. LLMs model users/items primarily\nbased on content, while conventional models derive users/items\nembeddings from collaborative signals. The vast semantic differ-\nences between these approaches mean that directly aligning their\nembeddings can be counterproductive, potentially disrupting the\nstudent’s original embedding space and weakening its ability to\ncapture collaborative signals.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose DLLM2Rec, designed to\neffectively distill knowledge from LLM-based recommenders to\nconventional recommenders. DLLM2Rec contains:\nTable 1: Recommendation performance and inference time-\ncost of BIGRec compared with DROS on Amazon Games\nand Toys datasets. Note that BIGRec is a typical LLM-based\nrecommender with LlaMA-7B and DROS is a state-of-the-art\nsequential recommendation method.\nDataset Model HR@20 NDCG@20 Inference time\nDROS 0.0473 0.0267 1.8s\nBIGRec 0.0532 0.0341 2.3 ×104𝑠Games\nGain +12.47% +27.72% −1.3 ×106%\nDROS 0.0231 0.0144 1.6s\nBIGRec 0.0420 0.0207 1.1 ×104sToys\nGain +81.82% +43.75% −6.8 ×105%\n1) Importance-aware ranking distillation. Rather than di-\nrectly aligning the ranking lists between the teacher and student,\nwe highlight reliable and student-friendly instances for distillation\nby introducing importance weights. This approach evaluates the\nsemantic similarity between the responses given by LLMs and the\ntarget positive items, with less similarity indicating lower response\nquality and suggesting such instances should be downweighted in\ndistillation. Additionally, inspired by the “wisdom of the crowd”,\nwe leverage the model consistency between student and teacher to\nevaluate the importance of an instance, prioritizing instances where\ndiverse models agree on higher item rankings. Such instances are\nalso relatively easy and friendly to the student models, helping the\nstudent to assimilate the knowledge from the teacher.\n2) Collaborative embedding distillation. To bridge the se-\nmantic gap between the embedding spaces of the teacher and stu-\ndent, we employ a learnable projector (e.g., MLPs) to map original\nembeddings from teachers to the student’s embedding space. More-\nover, diverging from directly aligning the student embeddings with\nthe teacher’s projected embeddings, we introduce a flexible offset\nterm that captures collaborative signals, further integrated with\nthe teacher’s projected embeddings to generate enriched student\nembeddings. This design effectively leverages the knowledge from\nthe teacher while preserving its capacity to capture collaborative\nsignals.\nThe main contributions of our work are summarized as follows:\n•Highlighting the inference inefficiency issue of LLM-based rec-\nommendation model and advocating the use of knowledge distil-\nlation for acceleration.\n•Proposing DLLM2Rec which leverages importance-aware rank-\ning distillation and collaborative embedding distillation to trans-\nfer reliable and student-friendly knowledge from LLM-based\nmodels to conventional recommendation models.\n•Conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate the effective-\nness of DLLM2Rec, enabling lightweight conventional models to\nkeep pace with sophisticated LLM-based models.\n2 PRELIMINARIES\nIn this section, we elaborate on sequential recommendation, and\nintroduce BIGRec, a representative LLM-based recommender.\nDistillation Matters: Empowering Sequential Recommenders\nto Match the Performance of Large Language Models RecSys ’24, October 14–18, 2024, Bari, Italy\n2.1 Sequential Recommendation\nThis work focuses on sequential recommendation, which has se-\ncured a pivotal role in various modern recommendation systems\nand attracted significant research interest. In a sequential recom-\nmender system with a user set Uand an item set I, a user’s\nhistorical interactions can be organized in chronological order\ns𝑡𝑢 = (𝑖1,𝑖2,...,𝑖 𝑡 −1)where 𝑖𝑘 ∈I represents the 𝑘-th item that\nthe user 𝑢 interacted with. We remark that in this paper we may\nshorten the notation s𝑡𝑢 as s for clear presentation. The task of\nsequential recommendation is to predict the next item 𝑖𝑡 that the\nuser is likely to interact with.\nSequential Recommendation Model. Existing models in this\ndomain primarily adopt representation learning paradigms. These\nmethods first utilize an item encoder to map items’ features 𝑥𝑖 (e.g.,\nIDs, titles) into their representations e𝑖 :\ne𝑖 = ItemEncoder(𝑥𝑖 ) (1)\nwhere ItemEncoder(.) can be implemented by various architectures,\ne.g., an embedding layer to encode item ID or BERT [14] to encode\nitem text.\nWith the item embeddings, user behaviors can be further en-\ncoded by a sequential encoder:\nes = SeqEncoder(Zs) (2)\nwhere Zs denotes the encoded item embedding sequence of s, i.e.,\nZs = (e𝑖1 ,e𝑖2 ,..., e𝑖𝑡−1 ). SeqEncoder(.) represents the sequence\nencoder and can be implemented by GRUs [21], Transformer [31],\nor other architectures.\nGiven the sequence and item embeddings, the final prediction\nˆ𝑦s𝑖 can be generated via the dot product [46] or MLPs [47], which is\nthen utilized to retrieve recommendations. Let 𝑖∗s (shorten as 𝑖∗) be\nthe ground-truth item of the sequences that the user𝑢will interact\nwith at the next step, the model can be trained via various losses,\ne.g., binary cross-entropy [51]:\nL𝑟 = −\n∑︁\ns∈Γ\n\u0012\nlog 𝜎(ˆ𝑦s𝑖∗)+\n∑︁\n𝑗 ∈𝑂−\nlog(1 −𝜎(ˆ𝑦s𝑗 ))\n\u0013\n(3)\nwhere 𝜎(.)denotes the Sigmoid function; Γ denotes the set of se-\nquences used for model training; and𝑂−denotes the set of sampled\nnegative items.\n2.2 Brief on BIGRec\nRecently LLM-based recommendation attracts great attention. Pre-\ndominantly, this body of work formulates the recommendation\ntask using natural language prompts and employs large language\nmodels to generate personalized recommendations [25]. This study\nsimply take the representative model BIGRec [3] for empirical anal-\nysis. The selection of BIGRec is justified not only by its availability\nas an open-source tool but also by its demonstrated effectiveness.\nFurthermore, BIGRec embodies the fundamental elements of LLM-\nbased recommendation and many methods can be considered as\nfurther extensions of such paradigm [ 54, 67]. It is also notewor-\nthy that BIGRec has been employed by recent studies [43, 44] as a\nrepresentative model for analysis.\nTo be specific, BIGRec organizes users’ historical behaviors in\nnatural language and employs instruction-tuning to fine-tune LLMs,\nTable 2: The ratio of cases where BIGRec outperforms DROS\nto cases where BIGRec underperforms DROS on NDCG@20.\nDataset Condition Relative Ratio\nBIGRec > DROS 53.90%Games BIGRec < DROS 46.10%\nBIGRec > DROS 40.90%MovieLens BIGRec < DROS 59.10%\nBIGRec > DROS 66.67%Toys BIGRec < DROS 33.33%\nas illustrated in Figure 1. During the inference stage, BIGRec gener-\nates item descriptions (e.g., titles) for recommendations. Consider-\ning that these descriptions may not always correspond to existing\nitems, BIGRec incorporates a grounding paradigm that matches\ngenerated item descriptions to existing items based on content sim-\nilarity. Formally, letz𝑔s and z𝑖 represent the token embeddings of\ngenerated descriptions and the descriptions of item 𝑖, respectively.\nBIGRec computes their L2 distance for grounding as follows:\n𝑑s𝑖 = ||z𝑔s −z𝑖 ||2 (4)\nBased on 𝑑s𝑖 , BIGRec ranks items and retrieve the K-nearest items\nas recommendations.\n3 METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we first outline the challenges associated with dis-\ntilling knowledge from Large LLM-based recommendation models\nto conventional models (subsection 3.1). Following this, we delve\ninto the specifics of our proposed DLLM2Rec (subsections 3.2).\n3.1 Motivations\nIn this subsection, we aim to conduct a thorough analysis to eluci-\ndate the challenges of distillation, thereby motivating our proposed\nmethod. These challenges can be categorized into three aspects:\nTeacher Knowledge Reliability. By examining the recommen-\ndation results from a typical LLM-based model, BIGRec, and a state-\nof-the-art sequential model, DROS, on three real-world datasets,\nwe empirically discover that the LLM-based model may not consis-\ntently surpass the conventional model in all test cases. In fact, as\ndepicted in Table 2, BIGRec may underperform DROS in over 30%\nof cases across all three datasets. This observation implies that the\nteacher’s knowledge may not always be reliable and could poten-\ntially be detrimental. The reliability of the teacher’s knowledge in\ndistillation must be validated.\nModel Capacity Gap. Recent research suggests that the perfor-\nmance of a student model diminishes as the gap in size between\nthe teacher and student models increases [ 27]. This challenge is\neven more pronounced in our scenario, where the student model\ncomprises a million-level parameters while the teacher model has\nbillion-level parameters. Additionally, the teacher and student mod-\nels employ fundamentally different recommendation mechanisms.\nWe notice a significant discrepancy in their recommended items\n— the average number of overlapped items in their Top-20 recom-\nmendations is less than 3.15% across the three datasets as shown in\nTable 3. It is implausible to expect the student to fully assimilate\nthe teacher’s knowledge and fully inherit the teacher’s ability on\nRecSys ’24, October 14–18, 2024, Bari, Italy Cui et al.\nTable 3: Ratio of overlapped items in Top-20 recommenda-\ntions between BIGRec and DROS. Additionally, we present\nthe percentage of these items that are actual hits. For compar-\native analysis, we detail the values specific to items unique\nto either BIGRec’s or DROS’s recommendations.\nDataset Rec. Space Items Ratio Hit Items\nBIGRec only 96.01% 0.21%\nDROS only 96.01% 0.18% Games\nOverlapped 3.99% 1.61%\nBIGRec only 95.94% 0.19%\nDROS only 95.94% 0.35% MovieLens\nOverlapped 4.06% 2.16%\nBIGRec only 98.95% 0.17%\nDROS only 98.95% 0.08% Toys\nOverlapped 1.05% 3.74%\nsemantic reasoning. Overloading the student with the teacher’s\nknowledge may even impair the student’s inherent capacity to cap-\nture collaborative signals. Our empirical study, as shown in Table 5,\ndemonstrates that existing knowledge distillation strategies usually\nyield limited improvements and can sometimes even be counter-\nproductive. Thus, the development of a distillation strategy that is\nfriendly to the student model is crucial.\nSemantic Space Divergence. It is noteworthy that LLM-based\nmodels characterize users/items mainly based on their contents,\nwhile conventional models derive users/items embeddings mainly\nfrom collaborative signals. It means the teacher and student adopt\nentirely different semantic frameworks. Blind alignment of their\nsemantic spaces for distillation could prove counterproductive. As\nobserved in Table 5, two representative knowledge distillation meth-\nods, Hint [2] and HTD [30], which distill through embeddings, often\nperform worse than the original student model without knowledge\ndistillation. While embedding distillation has proven effective in\nmany domains, it should be specifically designed for this task.\n3.2 Proposed Distillation Strategy: DLLM2Rec\nIn order to address the aforementioned challenges, this work pro-\nposes DLLM2Rec, with leveraging importance-aware ranking dis-\ntillation and collaborative embedding distillation.\n3.2.1 Importance-aware Ranking Distillation. This module builds\nupon the conventional ranking distillation [57] while additionally\nintroducing importance weights to emphasize reliable and student-\nfriendly instances. Specifically, we employ the following distillation\nloss:\nL𝑑 = −\n∑︁\ns∈Γ\n∑︁\n𝑖∈O𝑇\n𝑤s𝑖 log 𝜎(ˆ𝑦s𝑖 ) (5)\nwhere O𝑇 denotes the Top-K recommendations returned by the\nteacher model, and 𝑤𝑠𝑖 denotes the distillation weight. In this work,\nwe choose 𝐾 = 10 as a default value, but this can be tuned for\noptimal performance. The objective is straightforward — we select\nthe highly ranked items from the teacher as a positive to guide the\nlearning of the student, so that these candidate items can also be\nrecommended by the student. However, given that the teacher’s\nrecommendations may not always be beneficial, we introduce an\nimportance weight that considers the following three aspects:\n1) Position-aware weights 𝑤𝑝\ns𝑖 . Inheriting from [57], ranking\npositions are also considered in DLLM2Rec. The motivation is from\nthe ranking alignment that we would like to push a candidate item\nhigher if the item also occupies a higher position in the teacher’s\nranking list. Formally, we use:\n𝑤𝑝\ns𝑖 ∝exp(−𝑟𝑖 /𝛽) (6)\nwhere 𝑟𝑖 denotes the position of item 𝑖in the ranking list returned\nby the teacher, and 𝛽 is the hyperparameter adjusting the shape of\nthe weight distribution.\n2) Confidence-aware weights 𝑤𝑐\ns𝑖 . Given the importance of\nextracting reliable teacher knowledge, we leverage 𝑤𝑐\ns𝑖 to indicate\nreliability. Specifically, we measure the quality of descriptions gen-\nerated by LLMs by assessing the content distance between the\ngenerated descriptions and the content of the ground-truth item:\n𝑤𝑐\ns𝑖 ∝exp(−𝑑s𝑖∗/𝛽)\n𝑑s𝑖∗ = ||z𝑔s −z𝑖∗||2 (7)\nwhere 𝑑s𝑖∗measures the embedding distance between the generated\nitem description z𝑔s and the target ground-truth item z𝑖∗, where\nthe embeddings can be generated via LLMs encoder. A smaller dis-\ntance suggests a higher quality of the generated description as it\naligns more closely with the targets. Conversely, a larger gap sug-\ngests lower confidence, indicating that LLMs may risk generating\nincorrect or nonsensical information.\n3) Consistency-aware weights 𝑤𝑠\ns𝑖 . Inspired by the “wisdom\nof the crowd”, we use model consistency between the student and\nteacher to assess the importance of an instance. As suggested by\nrecent work on bagging [ 15, 76], when diverse models reach a\nconsensus on one prediction, its reliability increases. In RS, our\nempirical studies (Table 3) also shows that the items that are con-\ncurrently recommended by teacher and student are more likely to\nbe positive. This insight allows us to formulate consistency-aware\nweights as follows:\n𝑤𝑜\ns𝑖 =\n\u001a 1, 𝑖 ∈O𝑇 ∩O𝑆\n0, 𝑖 ∉ O𝑇 ∩O𝑆 (8)\nwhere O𝑇 and O𝑆 denote the sets of Top-K recommendation items\nreturned by the teacher and student, respectively. We assign higher\nweights to those overlapping items (i.e., 𝑖 ∈O𝑇 ∩O𝑆 ).\nAnother advantage for up-weighting those overlapped items is\nthat they are relatively easy and friendly for student learning. By\nexamining the gradient of the distillation loss:\n𝜕L𝑑\n𝜕ˆ𝑦s𝑖\n= 𝑤s𝑖𝜎(−ˆ𝑦s𝑖 ) (9)\nit is evident that instances with larger ˆ𝑦s𝑖 , i.e., higher positions in\nthe student ranking lists, will have smaller gradient magnitudes.\nThis suggests that higher-ranked instances are more easily assim-\nilated by the student model, as the student does not require to\nmake extensive change. Upweighting these instances makes the\nknowledge distillation process more conducive to student learning.\nWe integrate these three aspects into the ranking distillation\nwith a simple linear combination:\n𝑤s𝑖 = 𝛾𝑝 ·𝑤𝑝\ns𝑖 +𝛾𝑐 ·𝑤𝑐\ns𝑖 +𝛾𝑜 ·𝑤𝑜\ns𝑖 (10)\nDistillation Matters: Empowering Sequential Recommenders\nto Match the Performance of Large Language Models RecSys ’24, October 14–18, 2024, Bari, Italy\n1 2 n…\nRanking \nPosition\n…0.9 0.7 0.3\nRanking \nConfidence\n0 0…1.0\nRanking \nConsistency\nPrompt\nInteraction \nSequence\n“Nioh 3”\nGrounding\nRecommendation Space\nLLM CF\n𝒊𝟐\n𝒊𝒈𝒔\n𝒊𝟒\nEmbedding Space\n𝒊𝟏\n𝒊𝟐\n𝒊𝟒\n𝒊𝟏\nTop-n Ranking List\n𝒊𝟏 𝒊𝟐 … 𝒊𝟒\nRank:\nItem:\n1 2 n…\n1. “Nioh 2”\n2. “Elden Ring”\n3. “Dark Souls 3”\nN. “Bloodborne”Fine-tuned LLM\nTokenizer\nLLM-based Recommender\nCollaborative\nEmbedding Distillation\n+\n…\nEmbedding\nLayer\nSequential \nModel\nTop-N Ranking List\nImportance-aware\nRanking Distillation\nConventional Recommender\nGenerated\nDescriptions\nUser Embedding\nTop-N Ranking List\nSimilarity\n1.

This strategy is ineffective in this task, as it would\nincrease the distillation unreliability and difficulty. Our DLLM2Rec\nadopts contrary strategy and would yield better performance as\ndemonstrated in our experiments.\n3.2.2 Collaborative Embedding Distillation. Embedding distillation\nhas proven effective in many domains, yet it requires careful design\nin this context, given that the teacher and student possess quite\ndifferent semantic spaces. To tackle this, we adopt a collaborative\nparadigm. Specifically, we first employ a learnable projector (e.g.,\nMLPs) to map original item embeddings from the teacher to the\nstudent’s embedding space to bridge the semantic gap:\nz𝑝\n𝑖 = 𝑔(z𝑖 ) (12)\nwhere z𝑖 denotes the textual embedding of item 𝑖encoded by the\nLLM-based recommender; 𝑔(.)denotes a learnable projector func-\ntion, which can be implemented via MLPs.\nwe further introduce a flexible offset termb𝑖 for each item, which\nis integrated with the teacher’s projected embeddings to generate\nenriched student embeddings:\ne𝑛𝑒𝑤\n𝑖 = 𝑓(z𝑝\n𝑖 ,b𝑖 ) (13)\nwhere b𝑖 is a learnable vector designed to capture the collaborative\nsignals from user behavior data. 𝑓(.)denotes a function combining\nthe distilled information from the teacher and the information\nmined from the data. 𝑓(.)can be implemented via various ways,\ne.g., concatenate, MLPs. In our experiments, we find that simple\nlinear combinations suffice to yield satisfactory performance. Such\ncollaborative approach allows our model to leverage the powerful\nknowledge from the teacher while preserving its capacity to capture\ncollaborative signals.\nRemarkably, the distilled student is as efficiency as the\noriginal one during the inference . It only requires to leverage\nLLMs in model training, while directly utilize the well-trained and\nempowered student model for online service.\n4 EXPERIMENTS\nOur experiments address the following research questions:\n•RQ1 : Does DLLM2Rec outperform existing distillation strate-\ngies? How does the empowered student model perform?\n•RQ2 : What are the impacts of different components of DLLM2Rec\non its performance?\n•RQ3 : How do hyperparameters influence DLLM2Rec?\n4.1 Experiment Settings\n4.1.1 Datasets. Three conventional datasets:Amazon Video Games ,\nMovieLens-10M, and Amazon Toys and Games were utilized in our\nexperiments 1,2 . These datasets include user behavior sequences\nand item content. For fair comparisons, we closely adhered to the\npreprocessing methods used in recent work [3, 75]. We organized\nthe interaction sequences in ascending order of timestamps to par-\ntition each dataset into training, validation, and testing sets with\nratios of 8:1:1. Given that MovieLens-10M contains an excessive\nnumber of sequences, which could not be processed by LLM-based\nrecommenders, we sampled 100,000 sequences for training and\n10,000 for testing, the sampling strategy also adopted by [3]. The\ndataset statistics are presented in Table 4.\n4.1.2 Baselines. The following strategies are compared:\n1https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/\n2https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/\nRecSys ’24, October 14–18, 2024, Bari, Italy Cui et al.\nTable 4: Statistics of the datasets.\nDatasets Games MovieLens Toys\n#Users 55,223 69,878 19,412\n#Items 17,408 10,681 11,924\n#Interactions 497,577 1,320,000 167,597\nDensity 0.05176% 0.1769% 0.07241%\nKnowledge Distillation Strategies for Recommendation:\nHint [2], HTD [30] are two representative methods that distill\nknowledge through teacher embeddings; RD [57], CD [33], RRD\n[29], DCD [34] and UnKD [8] distill information from the teachers’\nranking lists. Readers may refer to the related work for more details\nabout these strategies.\nLLM-enhanced Recommendation Methods: We selected KAR\n[70] and LLM-CF [54] for comparisons as they are open-sourced,\nclosely related, and state-of-the-art.KAR leverages LLMs as knowl-\nedge base to enhance the profile of users and items, while LLM-CF\nuses LLMs to generate a base of chains of thought, which are further\nretrieved to enhance sequential models.\nFor fair comparisons, we integrated these methods into three\nrepresentative sequential models: GRU4Rec [21], SASRec [31], and\nDROS [75], which are either well-known or state-of-the-art. For\nthe teacher model, we consistently used the LLM-based model\nBIGRec [3], due to its availability as an open-source tool and its\ndemonstrated effectiveness.\n4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. We employed two widely-used metrics\nHR@K and NDCG@K to evaluate performance. Here we simply\nset K to 20 as recent work [20], and observed similar results with\nother choices of 𝐾.\n4.1.4 Implementation Details. All methods are implemented with\nPyTorch and run on 4 Nvidia A800 GPUs. We set 𝛽 = 1.0,𝛾𝑝 =\n0.3,𝛾𝑐 = 0.5,𝛾𝑜 = 0.1 across all datasets, as these settings were\nfound sufficient to generate good performance, although fine-tuning\ncould further enhance model performance. The influence of these\nhyperparameters on model performance is also presented in Figure\n2. Adam [32] was used as the optimizer with a tuned learning rate\nof 0.001, a batch size of 256, and weight decay tuned in {1e-4, 1e-5,\n1e-6, 1e-7, 0}, 𝜆𝑑 in {0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0}. We set the embedding size to\n64 and the dropout ratio to 0.1. Our code is available on 3.\nFor all compared methods, we closely followed the settings sug-\ngested by their original papers. We also finely tuned their hyper-\nparameters to ensure their optimum. Specifically, for BIGRec, we\nimplemented it with LLaMA2 [59] as suggested by the authors.\n4.2 Performance Comparison (RQ1)\nThe overall experimental results are presented in Table 5.\nComparing with students. The improvements brought by\nDLLM2Rec are impressive, achieving an average improvement of\n47.97% over the original students across three datasets and two\nmetrics. Furthermore, these improvements are consistent under\nall conditions. These results clearly validate the effectiveness of\nDLLM2Rec in distilling useful knowledge from the teacher to en-\nhance the student models.\n3https://github.com/istarryn/DLLM2Rec\nComparing with exising KDs. DLLM2Rec consistently out-\nperformed all KD baselines across all datasets and metrics. This\nresult clearly validates the effectiveness of DLLM2Rec, with lever-\naging reliable and student-friendly distillation strategies. We also\nobserved that some KD methods, e.g., Hint and HTD, showed a\nnegative impact on recommendation performance compared to the\noriginal student model. This could be attributed to the large seman-\ntic gap between the teacher and student models. Additionally, some\nadvanced KD methods like UnKD, DCD, HTD, and RRD may be\ninferior to the basic RD in some scenarios. This could be attributed\nto these advanced KD methods adopting more complex distillation\nstrategies, increasing the difficulty for the student to digest the\nknowledge.\nComparing with exising LLM-enhanced methods. DLLM2Rec\nconsistently outperformed KAR and LLM-CF. This result validates\nthe effectiveness of our distillation paradigm. Compared with KAR\nand LLM-CF, our distillation strategy effectively leverages the pow-\nerful recommendation capabilities of LLMs and directly transfers\nthese merits to the student models. Compared with the Chain of\nThought (CoT) utilized by LLM-CF, our distillation strategy di-\nrectly utilizes the teacher’s embeddings and recommendation re-\nsults, which could be more easily digested by the student models.\nComparing with the teacher. Table 6 shows the performance\nand efficiency comparison of the student model empowered by\nour DLLM2Rec with the teacher model BIGRec. To our surprise,\nthe empowered lightweight student can even surpass the complex\nteacher model using LLMs. This result can be attributed to our\ndesign — we target letting the student digest the knowledge from\nthe teacher while maintaining its own capacity to capture collab-\norative signals. Additionally, considering the inference efficiency,\nthe empowered student still maintains low inference latency, while\nthe BIGRec requires an unacceptably long inference time. This\nresult validates that our DLLM2Rec can indeed address a crucial\nproblem—maintaining excellent performance akin to LLM-based\nrecommenders while ensuring low inference latency.\nBesides, we conducted additional experiments to determine the\nratio of overlapping items between the teacher and student mod-\nels. As shown in Table 7, the post-distillation student model can\neffectively assimilate the teacher knowledge. Furthermore, it is\nimportant to note that the post-distillation student model may\nnot entirely replicate the teacher’s recommendations, given that\nthe potential unreliability of teacher knowledge and the inherent\nteacher-student capacity gap.\n4.3 Ablation Study (RQ2)\nWe conducted an ablation study on different datasets to study the\ncontributions of each component of DLLM2Rec. For the importance-\naware ranking distillation, we removed the entire component (𝑤/𝑜 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑟 ),\nposition-aware weights 𝑤𝑝\ns𝑖 , confidence-aware weights 𝑤𝑐\ns𝑖 , and\nconsistency-aware weights 𝑤𝑜\ns𝑖 , respectively. The results are pre-\nsented in Table 8. For the collaborative embedding distillation, we\nremoved the entire component (𝑤/𝑜 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒 ), the offset term, respec-\ntively, and tested the performance when replacing this module with\nexisting embedding distillation strategies including Hint and HTD.\nThe results are presented in Table 9.\nDistillation Matters: Empowering Sequential Recommenders\nto Match the Performance of Large Language Models RecSys ’24, October 14–18, 2024, Bari, Italy\nTable 5: Performance comparisons of DLLM2Rec with existing KD methods and LLM-enhanced strategies.

Others focus on improving LLMs’ ability to model\nlong-sequence interactions [18, 41, 82], identify noisy items [61]\nand some attempt to reduce training overhead [44]. While effective,\nthese methods often suffer from significant inference inefficiency,\nlimiting their practical application. Although some studies have\ntried to mitigate inference latency through pre-storage techniques\n[18] or knowledge distillation [ 67], the gain of [ 18] is generally\nmodest and [67] is utilized to distill a huge LLMs (e.g., GPT-115B)\nto a relatively smaller LLMs (e.g., Llama-7B). Even small Llama-7B\nis hard to deploy in practical.\nLLMs enhancing conventional recommenders. Existing meth-\nods mainly employ LLMs as supplementary knowledge bases [48,\n70, 74] or as encoders for users/items [50, 63, 69] to improve con-\nventional recommenders. For instance, KAR [70] utilizes LLMs as\nexternal knowledge bases to better profile users and items within\nthe recommender system. RLMRec [ 50] encodes user and item\nprofiles into semantic representations and aligns embeddings gen-\nerated by conventional models with those from LLMs; Wei et al. [69]\nexploit LLMs to uncover new relationships within graphs. However,\ncompared to direct LLM-based recommenders, these methods do\nnot fully leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs for\nDistillation Matters: Empowering Sequential Recommenders\nto Match the Performance of Large Language Models RecSys ’24, October 14–18, 2024, Bari, Italy\nmaking recommendations. CSRec [74] incorporates the common\nsense extracted from LLM to alleviate the data sparsity issue.\nTo capitalize on the reasoning ability of teachers, some efforts\nhave attempted to use chains of thought (CoT) data generated by\nLLMs to enhance conventional models [54, 67]. However, given the\nrelatively simple architecture of conventional models, it is notably\ndifficult for these systems to assimilate the complex knowledge\nfrom CoT data. Furthermore, CoT is typically used as a feature\nfor a sequence, indicating that CoT for a new sequence should\nbe produced during inference, which would be time-consuming.\nWhile some approaches attempt to retrieve similar CoT from other\nuser-item pairs [54], such approximations may hurt accuracy.\nDiffering from these methods, our distillation strategy capitalizes\non the superiority of LLMs as recommenders, transferring their ex-\nceptional recommendation capabilities to conventional models. Our\napproach involves direct distillation on embeddings and ranking\nlists, which are easily assimilated by conventional models without\nincurring additional computational overhead during inference.\n5.2 Sequential Recommendation\nSequential recommendation [7, 12, 35, 53, 71] takes into account\nthe sequence or order of interactions to predict what a user might\nprefer next. Existing Sequential RS use sequence generation models,\nsuch as RNNs [ 21] or Transformers [ 11, 31, 75], to model user\ninteraction sequences. For example, GRU4Rec [ 21] employs the\nGRU to handle session-based data, while Caser [56] uses CNN to\nmodel interaction data on multiple levels. SASRec [31] introduces\nattention mechanism to automatically learn the weights of different\ninteraction items, and DROS [ 75] leverage distributional robust\noptimization in sequential recommendation and achieves state-of-\nthe-art performance. Some other methods focus on the intrinsic\nbiases [9, 10, 42, 80] and distribution shifts [ 60] within RS. Most\ncurrent LLM for RS methods also adopt the setting of sequential\nrecommendation [3, 4]. The readers may refer to the excellent\nsurvey [16, 65] for more details.\n5.3 Knowledge Distillation in RS\nKnowledge distillation (KD) is a promising model compression tech-\nnique that transfers the knowledge from a large teacher model into\nthe target compact student model [19], and they have been widely\napplied in recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. RD\n[57] treated the top-N ranked items as positive for training a student\nmodel; CD [33] utilized soft labels to create positive and negative\ndistillation instances; Soft labels also considered by RRD [29] to cre-\nate the list-wise distillation loss function; DCD [34] built distillation\nloss on both user-side and item-side; UnKD [8] addresses popularity\nbias in distillation. The hidden knowledge among the middle layer\nof teachers are also considered in some methods. For example, Hint\n[22] and RRD [ 29] extracted knowledge of teachers’ embedding\nvia Fitnet and expert network; HTD [30] distilled the topological\nknowledge with the relations in the teacher embedding space. Some\nresearcher also study to distill knowledge from a huge LLMs (e.g.,\nChatGPT) to a relatively smaller LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-7B) in the rec-\nommendation scenarios. Besides model compression, KD is also\nused to integrate knowledge among different models [58, 73, 83].\nFor example, some researchers [83] consider to integrate knowl-\nedge from multiply pre-trained models into the student. To the best\nof our knowledge, the study of distilling LLM-based recommenders\ninto conventional recommenders remains untouched.\n6 CONCLUSION\nThis work studies on distilling knowledge from LLM-based recom-\nmenders to conventional recommenders. The distillation encoun-\nters three challenges including potential unreliable teacher Knowl-\nedge, teacher-student capacity gap and semantic space divergence.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose DLLM2Rec with leveraging\nimportance-aware ranking distillation and collaborative embedding\ndistillation for reliable and student-friendly distillation process. Ex-\ntensive experiments demonstrate that DLLM2Rec can effectively\nenhance the performance of three typical lightweight conventional\nmodels, with an average improvement of 47.97%, enabling them to\nkeep pace with sophisticated LLM-based models.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation\nof China (62372399) and the advanced computing resources pro-\nvided by the Supercomputing Center of Hangzhou City University.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Floren-\ncia Leoni Aleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal\nAnadkat, et al. 2023.
