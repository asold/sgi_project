The dataset is pub-\nlicly available at https://git.openi.org.cn/PCL-\nPlatform.Intelligence/Chinese_WPLC.\n1 Introduction\nPredicting a target word from previous context, es-\npecially long-range context, is a long-standing chal-\nlenging problem in natural language processing. A\nvariety of large-scale datasets such as CNN/Daily\nMail (Hermann et al., 2015), Who-did-What (On-\nishi et al., 2016) and CMRC-2017 (Cui et al., 2018)\nhave been developed to examine the capability of\nmachines in word prediction. However, the major-\nity of such datasets have not undergone a thorough\nmanual testing whether a target word can only be\npredicted from long-range dependencies except for\nLAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016). This dataset\nprovides a benchmark testbed where a target word\ncan be easily predicted with long-range context\nbut cannot with only context words in the sentence\nwhere the target word is located.\nPartially inspired by LAMBADA, we create\nChinese WPLC, a dataset for evaluating power-\nful pretrained language models on word prediction\nwith long-range context. The passages used in\nour dataset are carefully extracted from over 69K\nChinese novels following a procedure mixed with\nautomatic and manual selection. Signiﬁcant dif-\nferences from LAMBDA lie not only in language\n(English vs. Chinese), but also in the following two\naspects:\n• LAMBADA ﬁlters out relatively easy pas-\nsages with weak language models, e.g., RNN,\n4-gram and feed-forward neural language\nmodels, which makes it an outdated dataset for\ncurrent state-of-the-art pretrained language\nmodels as target words in many left passages\nmay be easily predicted by large-scale pre-\ntrained models. Additionally, the original raw\ndata used by LAMBADA may potentially ap-\npear in the training set of current pretrained\nmodels (Brown et al., 2020). To tackle the\naforementioned problems, we use two typical\nlarge-scale pretrained models to ﬁlter out pas-\nsages: NEZHA (a masked language model)\nand NEZHA-Gen (a casual language model)\n(Wei et al., 2019).\n• In order to take language features and difﬁ-\nculty level into account, we use new strategies\nand methods in passage collection, language\nmodel ﬁltering and crowdsourced passage se-\nlection, which are different from LAMBADA.\nWe carry out an in-depth analysis on the built\ndataset, ﬁnding that the relations between target\nwords and previous context ranges from lexical\nmatch, synonym, summary to commonsense rea-\nsoning. We conduct experiments on the built\ndataset to evaluate a range of state-of-the-art Chi-\nnese pretrained models, including the Chinese pre-\ntrained model PanGu-αwith up to 200 billion pa-\nrameters (Zeng et al., 2021), which achieves a top-\n1 accuracy of 12.1%, 45.2 points behind human\n3771\nDataset Task Data Collection QA Train Development Test Language\nCNN/Daily Mail Entity Prediction AC ! 380,298/879,450 3,924/6,4835 3,198/53,182 EN\nCBT Entity Prediction AC ! 669,343 8,000 10,000 EN\nLAMBADA Word Prediction RNNF+MC % - 4,869 5,153 EN\nWSC Commonsense Reasoning MC ! - - 285 EN\nWinoGrande Commonsense Reasoning MC ! - - 44,000 EN\nWPLC (ours) Word Prediction PLMF+MC % - 4,827 4,474 ZH\nTable 1: Comparison between our dataset and other datasets.

Children’s Book Test (CBT) (Felix et al.,\n2016) removes four types of words that are ex-\npected to be predicted by evaluated models and pro-\nvides candidate choices for models. LAMBADA\n(Paperno et al., 2016) masks the last word in a tar-\nget sentence and evaluates the ability of models in\npredicting the masked target words with broader\ncontext beyond target sentences in novels. Wino-\ngrad Schema Challenge (WSC) (Levesque et al.,\n2012) and WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2020) de-\nﬁnes a word selection task that focuses on solving\ncommonsense problems in the form of coreference\nresolution. Details on the differences of Chinese\nWPLC from previous related datasets are shown in\nTable 1.\nIn Chinese, People Daily (PD) & Children’s\nFairy Tale (CFT) (Cui et al., 2016) corpus is the\nﬁrst cloze-style reading comprehension dataset in\nchinese. ChID (Zheng et al., 2019) offers an in-\nteresting task where words to be predicted are all\nidioms. CLUEWSC2020 (Xu et al., 2020), a Chi-\nnese version of WSC dataset, aims to test the abil-\nity of coreference resolution via word prediction.\nSigniﬁcantly different from such Chinese datasets,\nour dataset is speciﬁcally developed for evaluating\nword prediction from long-range context.\n3 Dataset Creation\n3.1 Passage Collection\nTo diversify topics and domains, we collect raw\ndata for the Chinese WPLC from 69,067 crawled\nnovels with different topics (more details are shown\nin Table 2). The half of the crawled novels are\nused for training while the other half is used for\nBook Topics Nums Percentages (%)\nRomance 22,292 32.3\nFantasy 12,190 17.6\nUrban Supernatural 5,277 7.6\nComprehension 4,624 6.7\nRebirth 3,067 4.4\nScience Fiction 3,023 4.4\nHorror Suspense 2,162 3.1\nHistorical Military 1,868 2.7\nDetective Mystery 1,379 2.0\nModern 1,252 1.8\nOthers 12,933 17.4\nTotal 69,067 100\nTable 2: Topic distribution of crawled novels.\nextracting passages to build the development and\ntest set. We automatically extract passages from\nraw data according to the following three rules:\n• As raw Chinese texts are not word-segmented,\nwe use three different state-of-the-art Chinese\nword segmenters, PKUSEG (Luo et al., 2019),\nJieba1 and THULAC (Sun et al., 2016) to\nsegment extracted passages. Only passages\nwhere the last word to be predicted can be con-\nsistently identiﬁed by the three segmenters are\nkept.\n• If the last word is a stop word, the penultimate\nword will be considered as the target word as\nstop words are usually easily to be predicted.\nIf the penultimate word is a stop word too,\nsuch passages will be discarded.\n• We set the maximum length of a target word to\n4, making the most difﬁcult part of the task be\nto predict a Chinese idiom (four characters).\n• The maximum length of passages is limited\nto 400 characters as long passages make word\nprediction more difﬁcult even for humans.\n3.2 Passage Filtering\nSimilar to LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016), we\nalso use language models to ﬁlter out passages\n1https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba\n3772\nwhere the target words (the last words) can be eas-\nily predicted by language models. But signiﬁcantly\ndifferent from LAMBADA, we use more power-\nful pretrained language models, instead of conven-\ntional or neural language models trained on rela-\ntively small data, to make our dataset challenging\nfor state-of-the-art pretrained models.\nWe ﬁnetune NEZHA and NEZHA-Gen (Wei\net al., 2019) on the training data which contain\n8.7 billion words from 34,534 novels. We use two\nstrategies to ﬁlter passages: (1) predicting the tar-\nget word given a full passage (context + the target\nsentence that contains the target word) and (2) pre-\ndicting the target word only given the target sen-\ntence. Such strategies are not only more rigorous\nthan that used in LAMBADA but also consistent\nwith the succeeding crowdsourcing step. Differ-\nent combinations of the two pretrained models and\nstrategies are used to ﬁlter passages.\nIn LAMBADA, a passage will be ﬁltered out if\nthe probability of the target word is greater than a\npreset threshold. Predeﬁning an appropriate thresh-\nold is rather difﬁcult, heavily depend on human ex-\nperience. Thus, we use a different ﬁltering method:\nany passages where the target word appears in the\nlist of top-5 words predicted by either of the afore-\nmentioned two ﬁltering strategies are discarded.\nIn addition to this, another difference is that\nwe compute the ratio of the target word probabili-\nties estimated given the full and target sentence by\nNEZHA-Gen as follows:\nRatio(w) = P(w|c,s\\w)\nP(w|s\\w) (1)\nwhere P(w|c,s\\w) is the probability of the target\nword w given the long-range context c plus the\ntarget sentence sexcluding the target wordwwhile\nP(w|s\\w) is the probability of predicting wonly\ngiven s\\w. Higher ratios indicate that the target\nword can be more conﬁdently predicted given the\nlong-range context than the short-term context in\nthe target sentence. Preference is given to passages\nwith a ratio greater than the base e.\n3.3 Crowdsourced Passage Selection\nWe hire over 100 crowdsourced workers to manu-\nally select passages from the left passages after the\nautomatic passage collection and ﬁltering proce-\ndure. For crowdsourced manual passage selection,\nwe take 3 steps, similar to LAMBADA, where in\nthe ﬁrst two steps crowdsourced workers are asked\nTWL #Passages #Avg tokens #Avg sentences\n1 408/354 117.7/119.7 3.7/4.3\n2 3,904/3,670 130.7/136.1 3.6/4.3\n3 260/236 130.3/137.1 3.7/4.4\n4 255/214 128.2/127.2 3.8/4.0\ntotal 4,827/4,474 129.5/134.5 3.6/4.3\nTable 3: Statistics on the development/test set.

Avg DF/DL: the average number\nof tokens between a target word and its ﬁrst/last occur-\nrence in context.\nto guess the missing target word given the entire\npassage excluding the target word.\nIn the third step, three different crowdsourced\nworkers are asked to guess at most 3 target words\nper worker given the short-term context in the target\nsentence. If none of the manually predicted words\nare the target word, the passage is added to Chinese\nWPLC.\nParticularly, in each step, workers are provided\nwith the length of the target word to ease the guess-\ning difﬁculty.\nAt last, we collect 9,301 passages, among which\n4,827 passages from 17,266 novels are used as the\ndevelopment set while the remaining 4,474 pas-\nsages from 17,267 novels are used as the test set.\nTable 3 provides the detailed statistics of the devel-\nopment and test set with respect to the target word\nlength.\n4 Dataset Analysis\n4.1 Target Word Types\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of the types of target\nwords in Chinese WPLC. The majority of target\nwords are common nouns (60.5%), followed by\nverbs (19.9%). Different from LAMBDA, Chinese\nWPLC contain 3.4% Chinese idioms (See the third\nexample in Appendix Table 6). Chinese idioms in-\ncrease the difﬁculty of word prediction for machine\nalthough they are widely used in human-written\nChinese texts.\n4.2 Linguistic Relations between Target\nWords and Long-Range Context\nInspired by Jing et al. (2019) and Paperno et al.\n(2016), we further analyze the linguistic relations\n3773\nCN:60.5%V:19.9%\nJ:6.7%\nPN:6.7%\nI:\n3.4% O:\n2.8%\nFigure 1: Target word type distribution. CN: common\nnouns. V: verbs. J: adjectives. PN: proper nouns. I:\nChinese idioms. O: other.\nbetween target words and long-term context in pas-\nsages. We sample 100 examples from the develop-\nment set and ﬁnd four linguistic relations: lexical\nmatch, synonym, summary, reasoning as shown in\nAppendix Table 6. Lexical match, indicating that\nthe target word has also occurred in context, ac-\ncounts for 64%. However, lexical match does not\nmean that the target word can be easily predicted as\nfurther statistics in Table 4 disclose that the distance\nbetween the target word and its ﬁrst/last apperance\nin context is very long, ranging from over 70 to\n80 tokens. Synonym, suggesting that a word or\nphrase with similar meaning to the target word oc-\ncurrs in context, accounts for 15%. A more difﬁcult\nphenomenon is to summarize the given passage to\npredict the target word, which accounts for 8% of\nthe sampled data. The left samples need to conduct\nreasoning over context while the target word has\nnot been explicitly mentioned in context at all.\n5 Experiments\nWe carried out experiments with a range of state-\nof-the-art pretrained language models on Chi-\nnese WPLC. As BERT-large and the last layer of\nRoBERTa-large are currently not available for Chi-\nnese, results of these two models are not provided.\nTop-1 and Top-3 accuracy are reported.\n5.1 Baseline Models\nIn addition to BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), we also\nevaluated the following pre-trained language mod-\nels on the dataset.\n• ALBERT: ALBERT (Lan et al., 2020) is a\nlite BERT with fewer parameters but more\npowerful performance.\n• RoBERTa: RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) is\na stronger BERT without the next sentence\nprediction loss.\n• MacBERT: MacBERT (Cui et al., 2020) is a\nChinese BERT that uses similar words for the\nmasking purpose.\n• CPM: CPM(Zhang et al., 2020) is a Chinese\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) with 2.6 billion\nparameters.\n• PanGu-α: PanGu-α (Zeng et al., 2021) is\na Chinese pre-trained casual language model\nwith up to 200 billion parameters. The version\nthat we used in experiments has 13 billion\nparameters.\n5.2 Experimental Setup\nAll baselines were tested using their default\nhyper-parameters, including BERT 2, ALBERT3,\nRoBERTa2, MacBERT 4, CPM 5 and PanGu- α6.\nFor causal language models, beam-search was used\nto generate top-3 words and the number of gener-\nation steps was the length of the target word. For\nmasked language models, we downloaded a whole\nword mask version and selected top-3 words in the\nmasked positions as predicted target words.\n5.3 Human Evaluation\nIn order to assess human performance on Chinese\nWPLC, we hired another 4 crowdsourced workers\nto perform word guessing on 1000 samples ran-\ndomly chosen from the development and test set\n(500 each). Each worker is asked to guess 3 words\nand the ﬁrst word is considered as the most proba-\nble word guessed by worker.\n5.4 Results\nTable 5 presents the results of the models on the\ndevelopment and the test data. Note that the scores\nof NEZHA and NEZHA-Gen are 0 since they are\nused to ﬁlter passages in Section 3.2.\nPretrained Models vs. Human:All state-of-\nthe-art pretrained models perform much worse than\nhuman on this task. PanGu- α achieves a top-1\naccuracy of 12.1%, the highest prediction accuracy\namong all pretrained models, which, however, is\n2https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-BERT-wwm\n3https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT\n4https://github.com/ymcui/MacBERT\n5https://huggingface.co/mymusise\n6https://git.openi.org.cn/PCL-\nPlatform.Intelligence/PanGu-Alpha\n3774\nTop-1 Top-3\nNezha-Gen 0/0 0/0\nNezha 0/0 0/0\nHuman 57.3 66.4\nCasual Language Models\nCPM 0.6/0.5 1.5/1.5\nCPM-kd 1.2/0.9 2.9/2.4\nPanGu-α 12.7/12.1 -/-\nMasked Language Models\nBERT-base 7.3/6.3 10.1/8.9\nRoBERTa-base 6.5/5.7 9.8/8.9\nMacBERT-large 6.8/7.5 10.6/10.5\nALBERT-xxlarge 4.5/3.8 6.5/5.4\nTable 5: Top-1 and Top-3 accuracy (%) results of\nmodels and human on the development/test of Chi-\nnese WPLC.

The reasons may be two-fold.\nFirst, since MLMs are bidirectional, they can use\nextra information after target words, such as stop\nwords and punctuations, to predict target words.\nSecond, we used stronger NEZHA-Gen to ﬁlter out\npassages in dataset creation, which may make the\nremaining passages difﬁcult for other CLMs.\n5.5 Analysis on PanGu-αand Human\nPrediction\nWe analyzed 100 randomly sampled passages from\nthe development set to compare PanGu- α with\ncrowdsourced workers. One difference between\nhuman and models on word prediction on Chinese\nWPLC is that human workers can use the length\nof a target word as auxiliary information to predict\ntarget word while current models cannot use such\ninformation. We ﬁnd that 14% of predicted words\nby PanGu-αare completely correct and 22% are\nalmost correct (See the ﬁrst and second example in\nAppendix Table 7). There are also 11% of exam-\nples where target words predicted by PanGu-αare\nsimilar to the ground-truth target words (See the\nthird example in Appendix Table 7).\nWe also analyzed 100 sampled passages with\ncorrect word predictions by human workers and\nPanGu-α. We ﬁnd that 75% of these human predic-\ntions are lexical match and 7% are synonym. The\ntype of summary accounts for only 4% of passages\nwhile the left 14% are reasoning. For PanGu- α,\n71% of predictions are lexical match followed by\nreasoning which accounts for 23%. There are also\n4% of synonym, followed by summary, which ac-\ncounts for 2%. Lexical match is the easiest type\nfor both human and models. Even the target words\nof reasoning-type word prediction have not been\nexplicitly mentioned in context at all, we ﬁnd that\nboth human and models can do better than they\ndo in the other two types (i.e., synonym and sum-\nmary).\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have presented the Chinese\nWPLC, a Chinese word prediction dataset created\nfrom over 69K novels to examine the ability of\npretrained language models on long-term context\nmodeling. We employ both automatic and manual\nselection strategies to keep passages where target\nwords can be only predicted from long-term context\nbeyond target sentences and it is difﬁcult for pre-\ntrained language model to predict target words. Ex-\nperiments with a range of state-of-the-art pretrained\nlanguage models and in-depth analyse demonstrate\nthat the created dataset is a very challenging testbed\neven for the very large Chinese pretrained PanGu-\nα, covering a variety of linguistic phenomena (e.g.,\nlexical match, synonym, summary and reasoning).\nAcknowledgements\nThe present research was supported by Huawei.\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers\nfor their insightful comments.

The small airportin Corumba was very humid, and there was a crowd of Bolivians\nwaiting to head for Santa Cruz.They all carry bags of Christmas presents . The taxi driver he called didn’t understand a word\nof English, but it didn’t matter. Nate pointed out the words “Palace Hotel” in the travel brochure.

Having greeted the\nGrand Eunuch, Guofan sat in the Hall of Mental Cultivation waiting for the emperor’s coming. Guofan sat for two hours\nuntil noon, but still didn’t get called.

However, it is a pity that\nthose red who have no self-control failed to take actions, and many dreams eventually degenerates into fantasies. Thus, Don\nQuixote is not so much the last knight of Spain as a super fanciful representative of the red. There is no doubt that if the red\ncannot stop indulging in fantasy, even in some magniloquence, it will turn into <mask><mask><mask><mask>”easily.\nTarget word:纸上谈兵/ an idea on paper\n8\nReasoning\nPassage:孟飞酝酿了半天硬是没叫出爸和妈，苏蓝为孟飞解围说：“他第一次见你们，一时半会还不习惯。”她妈妈\n非常宽容地说：“小伙子第一次总是很难说出口的，结了婚就慢慢习惯了。”孟飞一听窃喜，这话表示她妈妈已经默\n许了他这位<mask><mask>。\nMeng Fei had been brewing for a long time but did not call out father and mother in the end. Su Lan helped him out and said,\n“It’s the ﬁrst time he has met you, so he doesn’t get quite used to it in such a short time.” Her mother said very tolerantly: “It has\nalways been hard for a young man to say this for the ﬁrst time, but you’ll get used to it after you got married.” Meng Fei was\nsecretly pleased on hearing that, which indicated that her mother had acquiesced in him as a <mask><mask><mask>.\nTarget word:女婿/ son-in-law\n13\nTable 6: Linguistic relations between target words and long-term context.

She ostracized\nme very much and was reluctant to see me.

But he still has an unyielding personality. However, I have become\nmore and more aware that he is no longer as enthusiastic about wealth as he used to be in the past. No matter how many enterprises and assets\nare owned by the Lu’s group, it’s just a paper of symbols for him.

If you know\nthis situation, you should try your best to help, and cannot show any complacency. On the one hand, it would make him shameful for receiving\nit and give him the feeling of having a new conﬁdant on the other hand. The encounter of an inch of gold and the grace of a meal can make him\nremember for life. And if you need help later, he will go out of his way to help you.
