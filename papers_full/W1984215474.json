  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose, implement and user-validate a training tool for saving fuel that uses some elements from games in order to promote efficient driving and provide feedback to the user. The proposed system uses a fuzzy logic system in order to assess the driving style from the point of view of the fuel consumption. The output is a score between 0 (not efficient) and 10 (efficient). This value can be compared with the scores obtained by other users of the solution that have similar characteristics in order to do a fair comparison and to obtain eco-driving advices adapted to the user's context and environment (e.g., braking frequency is greater on urban road than highway). Providing feedback to the user is essential in eco-driving systems for changing bad driving habits and not returning back to them. In our case, the system provides two types of feedback. The first type of feedback is provided in real time. When the user does not comply with some of a preconfigured set of eco-driving rules, he or she gets a warning message. The second type of feedback is based on a calculated relative score for each user according to his or her driving style, positioning the user into a ranking of eco-driving users and generating a set of eco-driving tips. A validation experiment has been conducted with 36 participants on three different routes in Spain. The results show that the use of gamification tools and techniques in eco-driving assistants helps drivers not to lose interest for fuel saving and helps them not to return back to their previous bad driving habits.",
