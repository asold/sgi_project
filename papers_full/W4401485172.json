    "abstract": "This paper explores the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in combination with easy-to-use interfaces such as ChatGPT and Copilot revolutionizing productivity in computing and processing. We conducted a user study in the education and industries to assess its potential impact and the opportunities of innovation. Specifically, the key challenge for LLM is to determine what constitutes a good text and natural language processing (NLP) techniques within massive computational infrastructures to communicate efficiently and affect institutions' innovation outputs.",
