With the maturing of  artificial intelligence technology, the human -machine collaborative \nteaching model is gradually attracting attention. Exploration of the path and effectiveness of integrating \nLarge Language Models (LLMs) into business writing teaching is urgently needed. This study takes the use \nof ERNIE Bot in teaching business proposal writing as an example, collecting and analyzing qualitative and \nquantitative data, and discussing the methods, effects and challenges of applying LLMs in teaching business \nEnglish writing in universities in China. The results show that students using ERNIE Bot as an auxiliary \ntool demonstrate higher participation and enthusiasm in the proposal writing process, and their writing texts \nhave significantly improved in terms of structural clarity and language accuracy. However, it has also been \nfound that ERNIE Bot tends to recommend conventional expressions and structures, which to a certain \nextent limit students’ personalized expressions. Therefore, the leading role of the instructor should not  be \nneglected. \n1 Introduction \nAmid the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and \nmachine learning technologies, Large Language Models \n(LLMs) in has been  lucratively implemented in \nnumerous natural language processing (NLP) functions \nincluding language production, textual error correction, \nand text summarization. In educational frameworks, the \nLLMs’ adeptness in understanding and generating NLP \ncan notably  streamline learning processes and boost \noutcomes. This asserts a significant potential application \nin language writing instruction. \nMastering business writing is a core skill within the \nscope of business English. Consequently, finding \nefficient avenues to  augment the quality of instruction \nhas become a prevailing focus for education \nprofessionals within business language instruction. The \ntask of crafting a business proposal, being constituent of \nintricate professional knowledge, specialized lexicon, \nand ad herence to business etiquette hence poses a \nformidable challenge for students and individuals \ninvolved in business English learning and business \ncommunication. Alongside, with the surge in \ninformation technology, human-computer collaborative \ninstructional models are drawing increasing \nacknowledgment. LLMs, akin to the language synthesis \ncapabilities as seen in the Chat GPT series  [1] and \nERNIE Bot (a type of LLMs developed by Baidu China \nCo., Ltd., a leading Chinese multinational technology \ncompany), including aspects of grammar, vocabulary, \ncontext, and style, tremendously broadens its \napplicability in business writing instruction  [2]. Yet, \nresearch anchoring an effective implementation of \nLLMs in business English writing remains scant. \n                                                 \n* Corresponding author: tang_xiao_fang@zjhzcc.edu.cn \nIn light of th e above, this study seeks to do an in -\ndepth exploration into the application of LLMs  \n(specifically ERNIE Bot) in educational methodology, \nincluding the practical technique, pedagogical efficacy, \nas well as the intrinsic challenges. It could serve as \nreference in bolstering human -computer collaborative \ninstruction in business language teaching. \n2 Literature review \nOwing to its commercial backdrop, business English \nwriting, as compared to general English writing, boasts \nunique stylistic characteristics in term s of format, \nstructure, and rhetorical strategies, making it an \nessential area of focus in English teaching [3]. Business \nEnglish writing not only requires speakers’ English \nproficiency but also necessitates their thorough \nunderstanding of the business environment and specific \nbusiness cultures. Although many courses and materials \nare specifically designed for business English writing, \nplenty of students still face challenges in accurately, \nfluently, and effectively using business English for \nwriting purposes \nIn recent years, there has been a notable intersection \nof information technology (IT) and language teaching, \noffering new perspectives on how educators approach \nthis field. Various attempts to implement IT in teaching \nwriting have been explored in China , with promising \ninitiatives and results that enhance the learning \nexperience significantly\n[4]. \nWang Haixiao (2014) explored some potential \npedagogical strategies for English writing instruction \nreform in the era characterized by big data technology \nSHS Web of Conferences 181, 01052 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202418101052\nICDEBA 2023\n© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution  \nLicense 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\nand pr oposed some coping measures for university \nEnglish writing instructors  [5]. Chen Xiaoxiao and Ge \nShili (2016) proposed that business English writing \nability should be analyzed in the dynamic process \ndivided into planning, writing, and completion stages  \n[6]. Chen Juanwen and Wang Na (2016), through \nempirical research, investigated the influence of \ndigitized learning resources on enhancing students’ \nEnglish writing ability and shared that diversified, open, \nmicro, and digitized learning resources could produc e a \npositive and far-reaching impact on enhancing students’ \nEnglish writing ability  [7]. As to teaching method, \nWang Wanrong (2019) contended that introducing case \nteaching approach in business English writing could \nprovide students with a real-world business experience, \nthus facilitating the cultivation of applied business \ntalents[8]. Liang Haiying (2022) outlined the core idea \nof English writing teaching based on digital humanities \nbased on their commonality with foreign language \nwriting instruction, particularly discussing digital \nhumanities tools deployable at various stages of process \ngenre writing and their application methods [4]. \nOverall, an emerging trend of integrating (business) \nEnglish writing with digital information technology has \nbeen observed  in teaching and research, yet studies \ntracing the combination of the latest LLM technology \nsuch as with ChatGPT and ERNIE Bot for “human-\nmachine collaborative” teaching are urgently needed. \n3 Research design \n3.1 Research questions \nDrawing upon the current state  of business English \nwriting instruction and research, the operational \nprinciples of LLMs and their present application status, \nthe research questions are set as follows: \n(1) How do instructors utilize LLMs for designing \nand implementing business English writing teaching? \n(2) What impact do LLMs have on students’ business \nEnglish writing abilities? \n(3) What are the challenges and issues encountered \nwhen applying LLM s in business English writing \nteaching? \n3.2 Subjects \nThe subjects of the study are from 2 natural classes of \nBusiness English course instructed by the first \nresearcher of this paper. They are 78 third-year college \nstudents majoring in business from an application -\noriented college of business in Zhejiang, China. Among \nthem there ar e 43 females an d 35 males, possessing \ncertain business knowledge and English ability \n(approximately at CSE Level 5 or IELTS 5.5). Before \nthe teaching, their mastery of business English writing, \nespecially complex business English texts, are not \nsufficient. Besides, only 7 of them have had experience \nwith the LLMs. \n \n3.3 Methodology \nThis study adopts a mixed -method approach, \nencapsulating both quantitative and qualitative research. \nQuantitative analysis allows the researchers to analyze \nnumerical data through statistical methods, providing \nempirical evidence to answer research question tw o \nconcerning the impact of LLMs on students ’ business \nEnglish writing skills. Conversely, qualitative analysis \naids in uncovering underlying reasons, motivations, and \nspecific problems encountered when applying LLMs  - \nhence addressing research question three. \nSpecifically, a case of teaching is reported. The case \nprovides a detailed  observational view of actual \ninstances where ERNIE Bot is used in business English \nwriting instruction.  It constitutes a documented record \nof classroom interactions, students’ performances, \npatterns of use, and practical challenges involving \nERNIE Bot during the course of teaching. \n3.4 Data collection and analysis \nData for the research was collected before, during, and \nafter the case teaching, briefly listed as follows: \nQuantitative data: A five -scale questionnaire is \ndeveloped (Cronbach α 0.921) and distributed pre - and \npost- case implementation. The questionnaire aid s in \ncapturing the possible change of perceptions, attitudes, \nor evaluations of students toward the use of LLMs in \nbusiness English writing.  \nQualitative data: Employing a content analysis \napproach, responses gathered from structured interviews \nof 6 students are evaluated. This aids in understanding \ndeeper dynamics, including students’ experiences, \nattitudes, perceived efficacy, and potential issues \nconcerning the use of LLMs. \n4 Design and implementation of the \nteaching case \n4.1 Teaching background  \nThe textbook used  is “International Talent English \nCourse (Intermediate Level)”, conducting teaching \nbased on workplace cases and tasks. Material \narrangement of each unit in the textbook follows this \nsequence: Scenario Introduction -  Task Description -  \nInformation Gathering - Skill Development - Task \nPractice - Vision Expansion.  \nThe case was selected from the fourth unit, with the \nprimary teaching theme of writing a business proposal \n(“Propose improvements to the sweeping robot”). The \nteaching objectives of the case teaching are set as \nfollows: \n(1) Knowledge objective: Help students understand \nand master the basic words, expressions,  structure and \nwriting skills for a business proposal; \n(2) Skill objective: Develop students’ proficiency in \neffectively utilizing LLMs to assist in writing business \nproposals; \n2\nSHS Web of Conferences 181, 01052 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202418101052\nICDEBA 2023\n(3) Value objective: Enhance students’ digital \nliteracy and higher-order thinking skills in using LLMs \nto discover and solve problems. \n4.2 Teaching design and procedures  \nBefore the class, t he instructor, also the first researcher \nof the present study, introduced the students to  LLMs \nand ways of i ntelligent questioning by referring to \nliterature [9] [10].  \nIn the class, the instructor first presented  the \nscenario for a startup, tasked with drafting a compelling \nproposal. Then, it involved phases of Information \nGathering followed by Skill Development and Task \nPractice sessions that encourage iterative improvement. \nFinally, Vision Expansion encouraged learners to apply \nthese acquired skills to diverse business communication \nscenarios, fostering continuous improvement in their \nwriting abilities. Throughout the teaching and learning, \nLLM empowerment was realized by using ERNIE Bot.  \nPhase 1: Scenario Introduction \nPrimary teaching activities: The instructor guided \nstudents to understand the real business situation of this \nproposal writing by watching a video. Students analyzed \nthe keys to succeed in proposal writing tasks, and \nstimulated learning interest. T he students also tried to \ndraft a business proposal and selectively presented their \nproposals. \nLLM empowerment: The instructor and students \nused ERNIE Bot to get more scenarios for writing \nbusiness proposals, then discussed and shared some of \nthe scenarios in class, enriching the case scenario corpus.  \nPrompts example: “Please provide some business \ncases required for writing a business proposal.” \nPhase 2: Task Description \nPrimary teaching activities: The instructor guided the \nstudents to refine and clearly define learning objectives \nand output tasks based on the given scenarios.  \nLLM empowerment: Students tried writing business \nproposals using ERNIE Bot. \nPrompts example: “What materials are need to be \nprepared for writing a business proposal?”  \nPhase 3: Information Gathering \nPrimary teaching activities: Through a combination \nof teaching and training, the students worked in groups \nto choose a business topic, applied the points and \nmethods of business proposal writing they just learned.  \nLLM empowerment: Studen ts used ERNIE Bot to \nreview and improve their proposals; the prompt given \nshould clearly state the evaluation criteria; groups used \nERNIE Bot to provide feedback and discuss together. \nPrompts example: “As a senior instructor of a business \nEnglish writing c ourse, please check the structural \ncompleteness, accuracy of wording, and logical \ncoherence of the following business proposal...” \nPhase 4: Skill Construction \nPrimary teaching activities: Students first selected a \nbusiness topic, then applied the essential writing tips and \nmethods learned for writing business proposals, then \nthey wrote their own draft of a business proposal, and \noptionally presented the draft proposal. \nLLM Empowerment: Students used ERNIE Bot to \ncheck and improve their proposals, with prompts that \nclearly outlined evaluation criteria. They also used \nERNIE Bot to provide feedback and discuss in groups. \nPrompts example: “As a senior English instructor for \nbusiness writing, please check the structural integrity, \naccurate wording, and logical co herence of the \nfollowing business proposal...” \nPhase 5: Task Practice \nPrimary teaching activities: Students combined the \nabove content to write, edit, and evaluate the proposal. \nThe instructor evaluated the proposal and provides \nsuggestions and opinions. \nLLM empowerment: Students used ERNIE Botto to \nwrite and edit proposals, including generating ideas, \nreorganizing and planning content, improving language \nexpression, etc.; the instructor used ERNIE Botto to \nprovide rewriting suggestions and ensure the evaluation \nwas fair and objective. \nPrompts example: “As a senior business English \ninstructor, please provide 2-3 English business proposal \ntemplates.” “Please evaluate the following business \nproposal and provide optimization suggestions from \nperspectives of str uctural completeness, language \naccuracy, and logic...”  \nPhase 6: Vision Expansion \nPrimary teaching activities: The instructor carried out \nsupplementary teaching and broadened the topic, \nespecially the cross-cultural factors in business English \ncommunication. \nLLM empowerment: The instructor used ERNIE Bot \nto give further comments and modification suggestions \non students’ final written text, guiding students to \nexpand their thinking. \nPrompts example: “Please elaborate on the \nimportance of business proposals in international \nbusiness activities.”  \n5 Results and discussion \n5.1 The Role of instructors in human- machine \ninteraction  \nIt was found that in such human -machine interaction, \nthe instructor played a leading role in teaching design, \nclassroom implementation, and teaching guidance. T he \nrole of the instructor has changed. Reflections from the \ninstructor and peer discussions show that when utilizing \nERNIE Bot in designing and implementing teaching, the \ninstructor’s role shifted from the traditional dispenser of \nknowledge to a guide and supervisor of learning. The \ninstructor would focus more on the interactive dialogues \nbetween stu dents and ERNIE Bot, providing targeted \n3\nSHS Web of Conferences 181, 01052 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202418101052\nICDEBA 2023\nfeedback and assessment and implementing \npersonalized teaching based on students’ needs.  \nBesides, the way of organizing classrooms has also \nchanged. When ERNIE Bot was used in designing and \nimplementing business Eng lish writing instruction in \nthis study, it became an essential medium, making \ninstructor-student interaction more diversified. \n5.2 The Impact of applying LLMs on students  \nAccording to the data collected, the overall impact of \napplying ERNIE Bot  in business English writing \nteaching on students was positive, mainly manifested in \nthe following aspects.  \n(1) Improved writing ability. Students’ writing \nsamples shows that out of those students who employ \nERNIE Bot to write business proposals, 80%  \nsignificantly improved their writing efficiency and \nquality. Their proposal structures  were clearer, \narguments were more logical, and their language \nexpressions are more accurate and professional. In self -\nfeedback, 70% of students expressed that during \ninteractions with ERNIE Bot, they gained new \nunderstandings and benefits regarding the use of English \nphrases, sentence structure, and logical argument \ndevelopment, shown in table 1. \nTable 1.  Descriptive data on the impact of applying LLM \n(ERNIE Bot) on students’ writing \n \nNote: For all the items, the Min. is 2.000, the Max. is 5.000. \nFurthermore, a pearson correlation coefficient was \nused to express the strength of the relationship between \nthe responses to “Do you know how to apply a LLM to \nbusiness English writing?” and “Has the application of \nERNIE Bot improved your efficiency in business \nEnglish writing (such as writing business proposals)?” \nis 0.409, which is significant at the 0.01 level, indicating \na significant positive correlation between the two, which \nmeans that those who knew more about how to LLMs \nbecame more efficient in business English writing, \nfollowing in table 2. \nTable 2. Pearson correlation coefficient \n \n*P<0.05**P<0.01 \n(2) Improved autonomous English learning ability. 85% \nof the students believed that LLMs like ERNIE Bot can \nprovide instant feedback and evaluation (shown in table \n3), helping students promptly identify their mistakes and \nissues and make corresponding improvements.  \nTable 3. Descriptive analysis of LLMs’ influence on \nstudents’ self learning \n \nNote:  the Min. is 3.000, the Max. is 5.000.  \n(3) Increased interest in learning. While using \nERNIE Bot for business English writing, their learning \nexperience was improved. Compared with traditional \nteaching, the interaction and immediacy of LLM s can \nenhance students’  learning motivation and interest, \nmaking learning more exciting and fulfilling. 83% of the \nstudents believed that using LLM-assisted writing gave \nthem novel and stimulating learning experience, \nincreasing their interest in studying, following in table 4. \nFurthermore, in the interview, they w ere asked: “How \ndo you think the application of LLMs can better \nstimulate your interest or motivation in learning?” And \nsome responded that t hey hoped that LLMs could help \nclarify their learning difficulties and provide them more \nauthentic materials or cases. \nTable 4. Descriptive analysis o f students’ attitudes towards \nusing LLMs \n \nNote: For both of the items, the Min. is 2.000, the Max. is 5.000. \n Furthermore, results of the interview confirmed that \nERNIE Bot was an interesting and critical tool for them \nto learn business E nglish writing in this case. For  \nexample, one student mentioned that “I remember that \nwhen I couldn't recall how to start the conclusion part, I \nimmediately thought of asking ERNIE Bot. It was \ninteresting to see it generating the answer, and I at the \nsame time got the expressions needed. However, in the \npast, facing this kind of problems, I would feel hesitant \nand just write down something perfunctorily”  \n5.3 Limitations of LLMs in business English \nwriting teaching \nThere are also some limitations of applying LLMs in \nteaching business English writing in this study. As \nFloridi (2020) mentioned that GPT -3 also had some \nlimitations [11]. \nIn this study, f or one thing, the students gave \nfeedback in the interview that when using ERNIE Bot, \nit’s hard to ensure the innovation and personalization of \nthe suggested proposals because it tended to recommend \nconventional expressions and structures. Besides, 13% \nof them reflected that sometimes the suggestions from \n4\nSHS Web of Conferences 181, 01052 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/202418101052\nICDEBA 2023\nLLMs conflict with their initial intention and creativity. \nOne of them recalled in the interview that “The \nsuggested answer was too lengthy and covers too many \npoints. And the ideas were too general.” Consequently, \nthey had to spend more time than expected on evaluating \nand selecting the suggestions given by ERNIE Bot. \n6 Conclusion \nThis study exploits the application of LLMs, ERNIE Bot \nas an example, in the practice of teaching business \nEnglish writing, emphasizing the importance of human-\nmachine collaboration. The major findings are as \nfollows: \n(1) The advantages of the human -machine \ncollaborative teaching model: \nFirst, it improves students’ business English writing \nskills. Relying on LLMs, students can receive timely \nfeedback on vocabulary, grammar, and text organization, \nas well as common expressions in business English and \ntemplates for drafting business proposals. This can \nenhance students’ writing skills and language accuracy. \nSecond, it enhances students’ interest in wri ting. \nLLMs can provide a more efficient method of writing, \nwhich may boost students’ interest in writing and \nimprove their positive attitude towards writing tasks. \nThird, it strengthens students’ technological skills \nand attitude towards  human-machine collaboration. \nThrough writing practice using LLMs, students can gain \na deeper understanding of the pros and cons of human-\nmachine collaboration, improving their technology \nskills. In addition, they become more willing to accept \nand use new technological tools for learning and work. \n(2) The shortcomings and challenges of the human-\nmachine collaborative teaching model: \nLLMs like ERNIE Bot tend to recommend traditional \nand conventional expressions and structures, which may \nlimit students’ innovation and personalized expressions \nto some extent. Excessive reliance on those tools may \ncause students to lose control over basic writing skills, \nor have overly high expectations for artificial \nintelligence.  \n The results of this study may inspire more \nresearchers or teachers to explore the application of \nLLMs in other foreign language teaching fields such as \ndialogue training and reading comprehension.  Despite \nof the significantly positive impact of LLMs on teaching \nbusiness writing, its limitations and issues should not be \nignored. How instructors  can properly and effectively \nguide students to use these tools still needs further \nresearch and discussions. \nAcknowledgment \nThis study is funded by the project “Research on the \nReform of Ideological and Political Teaching in \nWorkplace English Course under the New Business \nEducation Background” of Zhejiang Gongshang \nUniversity Hangzhou College of Commerce (2022), and \nthe project  “First-class Online and Offline Courses of \nZhejiang Province (2022): Introduction to English \nLinguistics”. \nReferences \n1.
