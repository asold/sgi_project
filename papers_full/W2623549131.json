Introduction\nVibroacoustic methods for the evaluation of the\ntechnical condition of various devices are more and\nmore commonly used in various ﬁelds. It is due to\nthe fact that the vibroacoustic diagnostics does not\nrequire permanent or temporary damage to the struc-\nture of the device. Vibroacoustic methods are used in\nthe diagnostics of rotating machines, such as turbines,\ncompressors, ventilators, pumps, engines, and in rela-\ntion to static machines ( Dwojak et al., 1999; Szy-\nmaniec, 2006; Wotzka et al., 2013). As a result of\nthe analysis of vibrations generated during the opera-\ntion of each of the above-mentioned devices, the tech-\nnicalconditionofinaccessibleunitsofthetesteddevice\nmay be evaluated. The application of vibroacoustic\nmethods in the diagnostics of high power transform-\ners mostly allows for the evaluation of the technical\ncondition of the coreof the transformer.The discussed\nmethods are more and more commonly used in rela-\ntion to transformers, in particular in relation to step-\nup transformers and high power mains transformers.\nInconjunctionwithotherdiagnosticmethodstheycan\nprovide information on the technical condition of the\nstructure of mechanical parts and the condition of the\nmain insulation of the transformer ( Bartolettti et\nal., 2004; Mizokami et al., 1997; Shengchang et al.,\n2006; Leonard et al., 2000).\nThe aimof vibroacousticmeasurementsisto deter-\nmine the level of mechanical vibrations of the tested\ntransformer and, in particular, its core and, thus, to\ncheck the technical condition of the entire unit. The\ncriteria for the evaluation of measured vibrations are\ndetermined to achieve the following goals:\n1) to ensure reliable operation of the tested trans-\nformer,\n2) to forecast the up-time of the transformer by de-\ntecting core damage and determining the dynam-\nics of its development,\n3) to minimise the inﬂuence of vibrations generated\nbythecoreonthewindingandtheentirestructure\nof the tested transformer.\n314 Archives of Acoustics – Volume 42, Number 2, 2017\nThe article presents the results of measurements\nandanalysisofmechanicalvibrationsofthehighpower\ntransformerincaseofwhichaninternaldefectwassus-\npected on the basis of chromatography tests of oil. In\norder to conﬁrm the damage to the active part of this\ntransformer, vibroacoustic measurements were carried\nout in three states of its operation. Measurements us-\ning the classical vibroacoustic method included the\nregistration of vibroacoustic signals at the idle speed\nand during the load operation of the transformer. The\noriginaldiagnosticmethod patented at the Opole Uni-\nversity of Technology, so-called modiﬁed vibroacoustic\nmethod, consisting in the measurement and analysis\nof vibrations of the transformer at the time of starting\nwas also used during the measurements of mechanical\nvibrations (Borucki, 2012b).\n2.

General view of the tested transformer at the work\nstation.\nThe results of chromatography tests (DGA) were\nthe factor determining the performance of vibroacous-\ntic measurementsofthe transformerTFR 250000/400.\nThe quantitative evaluation of concentration of gases\ntypical of the tested unit showed the high concentra-\ntion of so-called ﬂammable gases (Table 2), in par-\nS. Borucki et al. – Evaluation of the Technical Condition of the Active Part.. . 315\nticular hydrogen, as well as the increased amount of\nmethane and the clear presence of ethane, ethylene,\npropane and propylene. Additionally, the presence of\nrelatively large amounts of carbon dioxide proved that\nthe overheating of the insulation system of the active\npart of this device was developing. On the basis of\nthe DGA it was stated that the occurrence of local\noverheating of the core caused by its loosening may be\nthe likely cause of “gassing” of the transformer.\nMechanicalvibrationsofthediagnosedtransformer\nwere measured using the system Pulse DYN-XI by the\nBr¨ uel & Kjær company, the general view of which is\npresented in Fig. 2. The measuring box used was char-\nacterized by four separate channels, 24-bit resolution,\nthepossibilityofparallelmeasurementswithoutmulti-\nplexing, and additionally it was equipped with battery\npower supply which made it possible to separate the\nentire system from interfering signals present in the\nsubstation.\nFig. 2. General view of the measurement instruments used.\nDuring the measurements, four single-axis ac-\ncelerometers of type 4514-B-001,manufactured by the\nBr¨ uel & Kjær company, characterised by the sensi-\ntivity 10 mV/ms2 (f = 160 Hz), resonant frequency\nfrez = 32 kHz and linear bandwidth in the range from\n5–10 000 Hz were used. A calibrator of type 4294 by\nthe Br¨ uel & Kjær company with standard frequency\nf = 159 . 15 Hz and acceleration g = 10 m/s2 was used\nas the vibration standard during the calibration of in-\ndividual tracks. A Dell computer containing the in-\nstalled Pulse Time Data Recorder software was used\nforthe observationandregistrationofmeasuredvibra-\ntions.ApplicationsimplementedinPulseLabShopand\nMatlab were used for the analysis of recorded data.\n3. Methodology of conducted research\nand assumed diagnostic criteria\nThe measurements of mechanical vibrations con-\nducted under conditions of normal operation of the\ntested transformer were carried out by means of mea-\nsurementinstrumentsdescribed in Sec.2.Pointsbeing\nthe centre of the axis of symmetry of side walls of the\ntank were deemed to be the location of accelerometers\n(Fig. 3).\nFig. 3. Technical drawing of the transformer\ntank with marked vibration measurement points:\nl – length, h – height.\nDuring the measurements, the location of convert-\ners on the tank was not changed in the case of any of\nthe analysedstates of the operation of the transformer\n(idle speed, load operation, commissioning). Points\nmarked with symbols P1–P4 relate to the measure-\nmentsandanalysisoftheresultsofvibrationsrecorded\nfor the idle speed and commissioning of the trans-\nformer whereas points marked with symbols P1 ′–P4′\nrelate to the data obtained during the measurements\ncarried out during the load operation of the trans-\nformer unit.\nThe evaluation of the measurement results ob-\ntained using the classical vibroacoustic method in the\nsteady state operation of the transformer (idle speed,\nload operation) was based on the analysis of the fol-\nlowing criterion values:\n1) vibration components of up to 500Hz, as com-\nponents deriving from and characterising magne-\ntostrictive vibrations of the core,\n2) vibration components within the range from 500\nto 1500Hz, as components characterising the op-\neration of cooling equipment,\n3) vibration components within the band above\n1500Hz, as components generated by and charac-\nterising the operation of the core of the analysed\ntransformer (Kaźmierski et al., 2013).\nIn the evaluation of assumed criterion values the\nanalysis mainly focused on two parameters, namely\ntheamplitudespectrumwithintherangefrom1500Hz\ndo 2500Hz and the eﬀective value of vibration accel-\neration within the range from 100Hz to 2500Hz. De-\ntailed diagnostics criteria of the classical vibroacoustic\nmethod on the basis of ( Kaźmierski et al., 2013) are\npresented in Table 3.\n316 Archives of Acoustics – Volume 42, Number 2, 2017\nTable 3.

As a re-\nsult of the research conducted ( Borucki, 2009; 2014;\nBorucki,Cichoń,2010),itwasfoundthatafterpass-\ning from the transient state to the steady state of\nthe operationof the transformer,the occurrenceof the\nbroad and continuous frequency band with constant\namplitude of harmonic components in the range of the\nupper band of analysed accelerations corresponds to\nthe transformer without damage. However, after pass-\ning from the transient state to the steady state of the\noperationofthetransformer,theoccurrenceofthenar-\nrow frequency band with variable amplitude of har-\nmonic components in the range of the upper band of\nanalysed accelerations corresponds to the unit with\nsuspected damage to the magnetic circuit.\n4. Analysis of the results of vibroacoustic\nmeasurements\nIn order to determine the causes of the high con-\ncentration of gases dissolved in oil of the monitored\ntransformer and conﬁrm the diagnosis made on the\nbasis of the results of the DGA, the measurements of\nvibrationsusing the classicalandmodiﬁed vibroacous-\ntic method were carried out. Subsection 4.1 presents\nthe results obtained in the trials carried out in the\nsteady state of the operation of the transformer, while\nSubsec. 4.2 shows the test results obtained at the time\nof the idle speed of the transformer.\n4.1. Results of measurements carried out in the\nsteady state of the operation of the transformer\nFigure 4 and Tables 4–5 present the results of the\nanalysis of vibroacoustic signals recorded during the\nno-load operation of the transformer (points P1–P4)\nand the load operation of the transformer constitut-\ning approx. 65% of the rated power of the transformer\n(points P1′–P4′).\na)\nb)\nFig. 4. Examples of amplitude spectra of recorded vibroa-\ncoustic signals: a) measuring point P1, idle speed, b) mea-\nsuring point P1′, load operation.\nIt wasstated onthe basisofthe analysisofthe am-\nplitude spectrum of vibrations of the transformer de-\ntermined at the idle speed and compared to the limit\nspectrum (Table 3) that the values of dominant spec-\ntral components within the band above 1500Hz (Ta-\nble 4) exceed the level of 10 cm/s 2 (warning status)\nin two measuring points: P2 and P4. However, none\nof the components exceeds the value considered to be\nthe alarm value. Eﬀective values of vibration acceler-\nation within the band 100–2500Hz (Table 5) exceed\nthe limit value of 400cm/s 2 in two measuring points\n(P3 and P4). The evaluation of the vibroacoustic indi-\ncators determined for the load operation of the device\ngaveresults relativelysimilar to those obtained for the\nidle speed. The values of the dominant spectral com-\nponents within the band above 1500Hz (Table 4) also\nexceed the level of 10 cm/s 2 in the same measuring\npoints (P2′ and P4′).

There-\nfore, the conducted analysis shows that the magnetic\ncircuit of the transformer is responsible for the gener-\nation of the increased level of mechanical vibrations of\nthe tested transformer, and the participation of vibra-\ntions of windings caused by current ﬂowing through\nthem is relatively insigniﬁcant. Increased vibration in-\ndicators determined using the classical vibroacoustic\nmethod may indicate a gradual loss of rigidity of the\nmechanicalstructureofthecoreofthediagnosedtrans-\nformer unit.\n4.2.

Conclusion\nThe results of the analysis of vibrations of the\ntransformeroftypeTFR250000/400carriedoutunder\nconditions of normal operation, presented in this arti-\ncle conﬁrmed the possibility of using diagnostic meth-\nods prepared and developed at the Opole University\nof Technology in the industry. Thanks to the compar-\nison of the results of the DGA of insulating oil with\nthe results obtained using the classical and modiﬁed\nvibroacoustic method, it was possible to conﬁrm the\nloss of the rigidity of the mechanical structure of the\nactive part of the tested transformer – loosening and\nloss of rigidity of the mechanical structure of its core.\nResearch conducted on the high power unit conﬁrmed\nthat the use of the classical and modiﬁed vibroacous-\nticmethodinthediagnosticsoftransformersallowsfor\nthe non-invasive evaluation of the technical condition\nof their cores. According to the authors, the vibroa-\ncoustic methods should be currently used in the diag-\nnosticsoftransformersasan importantadditionto ex-\nistingmeasurementmethods,inparticulartheDGA of\noilonthebasisofwhichapreliminaryevaluationofthe\ntechnical condition of the active part of these devices\nis carried out.\nDue to the limited frequency band of the vibroa-\ncoustic signal recorded at the time of the commis-\nsioning of the tested transformer (Figs. 5–7), as well\nas the increased values of vibration indicators deter-\nmined for the steady state operation(Tables 4–5),and\nthe high concentration of ﬂammable gases in oil (Ta-\nble 2), constant monitoring of their increase using the\nDGAmethodwasrecommended.Incaseoftheacceler-\nation of dynamics of the increase in the concentration\nof speciﬁc typical gases, it was also recommended to\ncarry out vibroacoustic measurements once again and,\nincaseoftheirnegativeresults,tocarryoutaninternal\ninspection of the diagnosed transformer.\nReferences\n1.
