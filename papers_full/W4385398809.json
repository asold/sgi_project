ATS functions to produce \na clear summary while maintaining the main information and the overall meaning contained therein  [2]. Text \nsummarization is grouped into two methods, extractive and abstractive. Extractive text summarization uses the \ncalculation of the score of words in sentences  [3]. At the same time, the summary text abstraction aims to produce a \nsummary by i nterpreting and analyzing the text as a whole so that it has less text but still contains the essential \ninformation conveyed in the original text [2]. \nOne of the studies was carried out using the Sequence -to-Sequence method with enhanced features for single \ndocuments [4]. It used a non-local network feature that functions to improve the traditional Sequence -to-Sequence \nstructure, thus proving that the model proposed in this study has more effective results compared to the basic model, \nwith an increase of 5.6%, 5.3%, 6.2% in three ROUGE matrix of R-1, R-2, and R-L values. \nAnother research was carried out using the transformer method and datasets from 'Wikipedia' and 'The Hindu' [5]. \nThe data was processed using the Bidirectional Encoder Representation Transformer (BERT) model, which produced \nROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L values of 41.72, 19.39, and 38.76, respectively.  \nBased on our observation, transformer architecture has a better effect than other methods in summarizing large -\nscale texts. Transformer architecture performs text summarization automatically using self -attention to calculate \ndifferent input and output representations [6]. For this reason, we would implement a transformer architecture using \nPTLMs (Pre-Trained Language Models) that have been trained with large -scale data, namely the T5 (Text -to-Text \nTransfer Transformer) model, into Indonesian language do cuments. This study aimed to prove the effectiveness of \nthe T5 pre-trained model in ATS of large-scale Indonesian online news data. \nResearch Article       Open Access (CC–BY-SA) \nAbstract  \nAutomatic Text Summarization (ATS) is one of the utilizations of technological sophistication in terms of text \nprocessing assisting humans in producing a summary or key points of a document in large quantities.

We also found several errors in the reference summary in the \ndataset used. \n125 ILKOM Jurnal Ilmiah Vol. 15, No. 1, April 2023, pp.124-131 E-ISSN 2548-7779 \n  \n \n \n Itsnaini, et. al. (Abstractive Text Summarization using Pre-Trained Language Model \"Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)\") \nMethod  \nA. Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) \nThe development of text summarization has been improving, it can be seen from the increasing number of \nresearch discussing ATS. ATS is divided into two methods, extractive and abstractive. Research on extractive forms \nusing the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) process was carried out using the SumEval dataset[7]. The data \nwas extracted through the self -attention stage, combined with the original sentences that were previously extracted \nthrough Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  In the final stage,  the aspect -category or aspect -term data was \nconnected to obtain the feature sentiment results. The results on the aspect category with the Gated CNN self-attention \nmodel yielded scores of 81.40 and 79.77. Meanwhile, the aspect term with the same model produced 71.96 and 62.54. \n The research was carried out in an abstract form using the sequence-to-sequence method of summarizing English \nsocial media texts [8]. An intervention was conducted to the encoder to filter information better. The Evaluation acores \nof the F1 ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L were 2.6%, 2.1%, and 2.5%, respectively. These results showed that \nthe selective method given to the encoder work ed optimally. The transformer approach for Indonesian -language \ndatasets was used to detect rude comments on online news in Indonesia[9]. The model used was the BERT model and \nthe BERT Multilingual pre -train to serve as a baseline, so that the results from the Scratch model that were trained \nobtained an F-1 average score of 50%, which was then compared to the Multilingual BERT model of 54%. \n \nTransformer. Transformer architecture changed the sequence using two necessary essential encoders and a \ndecoder. The function of the encoder was to capture the input sequence and process information with a fixed length \nand sequence, after that the decoder displayed the output previously processed on the encoder , shown in Figure 1. \nBoth of these parts could work optimally when using the attention mechanism (Attention Mechanism)  [10][11]. The \nattention Mechanism functioned to connect the encoder and decoder in processing the information provided by giving \nattention to long input sentences  [12]. So that information can be disseminated to all sequences of input sentences \nwhich were carried out selectively by the decoder with an attention mechanism [13].  \nThe research was conducted to summarize news  about COVID-19 using a transformer architecture [14] by \nutilizing the encoder-decoder model and obtaining ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores of 0.58 and 0.42, with a training \ntime of 11438 seconds, respectively. \nText-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5).  The T5 model is a framework developed on top of popular \narchitectures such as BERT, GPT, etc., by utilizing text-to-text transfer learning, as shown in Figure 2, with examples \nof translation tasks, text similarities, and text summaries. T5 is an end -to-end trained transformer model with text as \ninput and modified text as output[15].  In its completion, the T5 model proved successful and capable of performing \nthree tasks [16]: generating, classification, and regression.  \nThe application of the T5 model to the BBC News dataset to determine which model is superior to the ROUGE \nevaluation value. Research comparing several transformer models [3],  one of which is the T5 model, which is proven \nFigure 2. How the T5 models work \nFigure 1. Transformer architecture \nwith an attention mechanism \n \n\n126 ILKOM Jurnal Ilmiah Vol. 15, No. 1, April 2023, pp.124-131 E-ISSN 2548-7779 \n  \n \n \n Itsnaini, et. al. (Abstractive Text Summarization using Pre-Trained Language Model \"Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)\") \n \nto be superior to other transformer models . The score of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L are 0.47, 0.33, and \n0.42 respectively.  \nTransformers, a tool or platform for downloading and training pre -trained models, has been trained on previous \ndatasets using Hugging Face[17]. Pre-training of models has been carried out on larger corpus or datasets to improve \nmodel performance[18]. The pre-trained Model T5 has several types according to the size of the parameters [15], \nincluding  : \n• T5-Small : 60 M of parameters \n• T5-Base : 220 M of parameters \n• T5-Large : 770 M of parameters \n• T5-3B : 3 B of parameters \n• T5-11B : 11 B of parameters \nModels with smaller parameters can help train data with  limited hardware specifications. The pre-training model \nused in this study uses the \"cahya/t5 -base-indonesian-summarization-cased\" model for Indonesian texts with fine-\ntuning on the id_liputan6 dataset. Specifically, the T5-base model trains a model with a pre-trained text-to-text format \nwith parameters of 220 M [15] [19]. T5-base is applied to the encoder in the form of Indonesian news text. \nB. Experiment \nAs part of the research, we outline the research flow in  Figure 3 by pre-processing the text of the article in the \nencoder by adding the “summarize:” prefix to facilitate the task intended by the input. The hyperparameters used in \nthis research adjust to the hardware resources’ limitations. We implement tokenizing with a maximum of 512 words \nfor each encoder and 128 words for the decoder.  \nThe hardware specifications used can be described as follows: \n• Python 3.6 and up \n• Transformers dan PyTorch  \n• Python Machine Learning base libraries \n• High RAM GPU settings \n1) Preparing Dataset \nThis study only used 9,387 data from IndoSum's 18,774 Indonesian language news . This was due to our limited \nresources in conducting this research. But this d id not affect the evaluation process in modelling. So, the research \nobjectives could still be achieved. We divide the data into training data (90% = 8448) and testing data (10% = 939). \nTo validate during training, we divided 10% of the training data, namely 845 data, for data validation. IndoSum's news \ndata was taken from major Indonesian-language news portals, Kumparan and CNN Indonesia [20].  \n \nFigure 3.

(Abstractive Text Summarization using Pre-Trained Language Model \"Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)\") \n2) ROUGE Evaluation \nThe evaluation used in this research was the ROUGE (Recall -Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) \nmatrix[21]. Rouge is an evaluation tool used for multi -document summarization and has great ad vantage in text \nsummarization [22]. Rouge generally compares the human summary as a model with the machine summary. In this \ncase, the evaluation used in the current study was the number of unigrams for ROUGE-1, namely between the system \nsummary and the reference, the number of bigrams for ROUGE -2 between the system and the reference summary, \nand ROUGE-L by comparing the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between the summary results machine with \nsummary reference to the dataset. In equation (1), it was explained that the value of LCS or the longest word compared \nto M was the number of words in the reference summary [23].  \n𝑅𝑂𝑈𝐺𝐸 − 𝐿 =\nLCS\nM             (1) \nEach ROUGE value included the Recall (2), Precision (3), and F1-Score (4) matrices. \n𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =\nW overlapped\nW ref                 (2) \n𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =\nW overlapped\nW cand                            (3) \n𝐹1 − 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =  \n2 𝑥 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑥 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛\n(𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙+𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛)             (4) \nResults and Discussion  \n \nFigure 4.

After receiving a ball from Marouane Fellaini, Martial dribbled the ball while penetrating the \nReal Madrid penalty box.  Martial was being closely shadowed by Dani Carvajal plus supervision from Luka Modric. \nHowever, Martial w as able to weave the ball quickly from right to left foot repeatedly. After Carvajal was tricked \nRaphael Varane tried to help. But Martial coolly sent the ball to Lingard who was in front of the goal. Lingard also \nwithout difficulty struck the ball into th e goal. Madrid successfully answered Lingard's goal itself  through Casemiro's \npenalty in the second half. But in the end Manchester United won via penalty shootout . In the penalty shoot -out, two \nManchester United executors Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Daley Bli nd managed to carry out their duties while in the Los \nBlancos camp only Luismi Quezada managed to become the executor. The victory of \"\"Red Devils\"\" over Los Blancos \nhas made the positive trend of Jose Mourinho's squad on the pre -season tour continue.

(Abstractive Text Summarization using Pre-Trained Language Model \"Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)\") \n• Paraphrasing produced by the model was not optimal. An example of a successful paraphrase was \n“Kemenangan” at the beginning of a predicted summary sentence. “Kemenangan” was a paraphrase of the \nsentence “Manchester United menang atas Real Madrid ”. In addition, the model summary results were \nonly in the form of main sentences that exactly match the encoder. This might be due to the absence of Word \nEmbedding before training. So, the model cannot read words that had the same context.  \n• The model managed to read and save the meaning of the sentence “Kemenangan Setan Merah atas \nBlancos” as the meaning of “Kemenangan Manchester United atas Real Madrid”.  \n• In the text of the article, some words that were not labelled were omitted and randomly removed. The model \nonly took the main sentence at the beginning and end of the paragraph.  \n• Score Recall on ROUGE -L in Table 1 showed the number 0.4 of the calculation results of the LCS or the \nlongest word in the engine resulting in summary, namely the predicted summary compared to the summary \nof the dataset. The results were low because the difference between the two was noticeable.  \n \nWe also found several errors in the dataset, where the summary reference of the dataset was only in the form of \nrewritten main sentences; no changes to words or paraphrases were made from human summaries.

It can be seen \nclearly in Figure 6 that the reference summary only contain ed the repetition of the first sentence of the paragraph. \nThere was not a single change or layout for each word. This was an important thing to consider before doing research.  \nTable 2.

(Abstractive Text Summarization using Pre-Trained Language Model \"Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)\") \n \nerrors in the dataset and model results were also essential in calculating this evaluation. We assumed the high results \nwere generated because some reference summaries only take the paragraph’s main sentences. Meanwhile, the model \nproduced in this study can only paraphrase a few of the many words in the news article, so several summary models \nwere also generated from the main sentences of the paragraph.  \n \nConclusion  \nModel T5 (Text -to-Text Transfer Transformer) is the newest PLTM that requires highly qualified research \nresources. The pretrained T5 model resulting from this study obtained an average evaluation value of ROUGE -1 of \n0.68, ROUGE-2 of 0.61, and ROUGE-L of 0.65. This showed that the model succeeds in paraphrasing sentences even \nthough only a few and not optimally; at least the model did not change the meaning of the original article so that the \nsummary was easy to understand without having to read the original article. \nFor further research, some suggestions that can be done and even prepared are: \n• Using datasets that have more data and maximum quality reference summaries. With more data, it is \nhoped that the model can store much vocabulary to be later implemented on the test data with paraphrases \nthat still make sense and don't change the meaning of the context in it. \n• Doing word embedding after preprocessing. It  is meant to convert the word into a vector and save it to \nsee whether the next word has the same context. Then the paraphrase will work more optimally. \n• Using a pre-trained model with more extensive parameters, such as T5-Large and some above.  \n• Adding batch size and epoch training to produce better model results. \n \nReferences  \n[1] A.
