  "abstract": "Since the beginning of modern science, researchers have used a specific format to communicate their findings in a standardized language. Such formats help to ensure that results can be replicated and published. With the rise of digitalization, artificial intelligence has become increasingly important in combination with the scientific literature sources of data. This synergy serves as a foundation of robust models following central principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data. By having access to more precise data, it is reasonable to anticipate the development of improved models. Specifically, large neural networks have demonstrated a high level of responsiveness to the quality of the data used. Therefore, enhancing the data quality can potentially lead to a reduction in the size of neural networks. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven to be incredibly effective at replicating human tasks. This is a significant improvement that not only automatizes process but also leads to better results. By combining human and LLM assistance, we can produce higher-quality content and solve repetitive tasks that would otherwise take years to complete. Those generative AI assistants can follow instructions to transform and extrapolate existing text. Our contribution outlines a method for automatically extracting experimental data of molecules from literature. Essentially by our prompt engineering, we demonstrate that this process can be made more cost-effective. Secondly, we use automated fact checking principles to ensure the original data quality as well as the data retrieval by LLM. Ultimately, our aim is to provide guidance for the publication of organic chemical experimental data to assist researchers and enhance FAIR data.",

This sectioncontainsstructureddatasuchasthename of the molecule, which usually follows IUPAC\n7 \n(International Union Of Pure and AppliedChemistry) nomenclature. There are various tools available, such as rule-based systems (likeOPSIN\n8\n) or neural networks that can convert names tomolecules\n9\n. Similarly, transformers\n10 \ncanbeusedtoconvert SMILES\n11 \n(SimplifiedMolecular Input LineEntrySpecification)toIUPAC\n7 \nnames.Wehave seen that this conversion is the most difficult part of the automation because IUPACnomenclatureishighlycomplexandnotthebestidentifierofmolecules\n12,13\n.\nOther important informationthat canbefoundintheexperimental sectionincludesthereactionyield,which is the conversion factor of the main reactant to the new product. Predicting this property isdifficult\n14\n. Additionally, the formof the product (e.g. liquidor solid) andits color canbereported, aswell as physical properties like melting and boiling points. Theseproperties areoftenreportedwithconditionssuchasthepressureofthemeasurementandtheunitsused.\nFinally, theexperimental sectioncontains ananalytical portionthattypicallyincludesdataoninfrared,nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectra. This analytical data is crucial for validating the\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-05v1b-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9828-386X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

Recognizingthepotential of ChatGPT,thedecisionwasmadetogiveitachancetoautomatethistask.\nWehaveobservedthat theexperimental sectionof papers contains various types of structureddatathat differ slightly from paper to paper. To handle this variability, we have created a prompt thatprovides a flexible structure for the solution. This type of structure is commonly used in NoSQLdatabases and applications to pre-define thepotential structureof anobject tostoreinMongoDB\n15\n.ChatGPTrequiresclearinstructionstofollowduringtheconversionprocess.Forexample,ifaconciseresponse without a deep analysis of the question and answer is desired, one can request \"nocomment,noexplanation.\"\nBy applyingdatatemplateconstraintstotheprompt,ChatGPTprovidesanormalizeddataoutputthatis easily parsableandpre-structuredfor databases. Weconductedanablationtest by removingourdata template constraints, and as a result, we obtained unstructured data (see Table A1 in theappendix), wherethefields didnot match, andtheextracteddataformatwasnotconsistentfromonecall toanother.\nHowever, oneconstraint of any methodis thefinancial aspect. Consideringthecostper1000tokensof OpenAI, it is necessary to fine-tune the prompt to maximize the chances that the question andresponse are short. Our initial idea was to work with a well-known JSON\n16 \ndata format, which iscommonly usedtostoredata.However,onedrawbackofthisformatistheredundancyofthe\"key\"fora\"value\" series intheJSONobject,makingitsuboptimal intermsoftokensize.Whileitispossibletooptimizeit,theformatwouldbemoredifficultforChatGPTtounderstand.\nGiven that thetrainingset of ChatGPTincludes thefull humandigital universe, whichencompassesany digital data and known structure formats, it is important to use an established format such asJSON. Alternatively, YAML\n17 \nis another useful format for structuring datathat allows for flexibility insetting the presence or absence of a field with a \"?\". It also includes data types and hierarchicalsubstructuresimilartotheJSONformat,whichisimportantforcapturingNMRandMSdata.\nTo create an automated process for extracting experimental data, an application and controllingmethodmust bedeveloped. Theapplicationtakestheexperimental datausingbasicrules,injectstheprompt question before it, and sends the question to the assistant. The OpenAI API is thencalledusingthis prompt, andit returns theresult as aYAMLoutput.ThisYAMLoutputcanbeeasilyparsedby theapplicationtobuildadatabasecontainingall theextracteddataperexperimental section.Thisdatabaseisthencheckedbyahumanthroughthecontrollingview.Thegoal istofine-tunetheprompttoobtainsatisfactorycoverageofthedataincluded.\nTo fine-tune the prompt, several metrics are defined to comparetheefficiency of different prompts.This is similar toanauthorexaminationmethod\n18\n.Withchemical data,thequalityofthedataobtainedcan be easily checked. For example, one can verify if the SMILES can be converted into a truemolecule object with OpenChemLib\n19,20 \nor RDKit\n21\n. As, SMILES is a chemical standard forWikipedia\n22,23\n. The first stepis todetermineif thechemical namecanbeconvertedintoamolecule,followed by verifying if the molecule corresponds to the number of atoms in themolecular formula(MF) if theMFwasprovidedintheexperimental data. Thesebasicmetricshelpdeterminetheoverallefficiency on a subset of papers to determine the best prompt, taking into account thecost of APIusageasasecondcriteriaforfine-tuning.\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-05v1b-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9828-386X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

Withoptimal YAMLinstructions, weareabletoreducethecost and solve this challenge. Weanalyzedasubset andfoundthat wecanextract 74%of databyname using the ChatGPT 3.5 turbo API version. Whileit wouldtakenearly onefull day of work forhumans, the extraction process takes less than onehour for acost of 2.4$per 1000experiments.Additionally, wewereabletocontrol thedataquality(40%),interestinglywereachedaccuracyof53%for only1HNMRdata.For100$,weget1yearFTE(full timeequivalent)humanextractionwork.Anychemist or scientist canuseour open-sourcecodetoextract theirownresearchpaperandmakethedatasetavailabletothewholecommunity.\nWe can easily extrapolatethat wecanfine-tuneamuchsmaller open-sourceLLMtoreproduceourwork without additional cost on the API\n33\n. However, we must also consider that the OpenAI APIprovides hardwareof computationincludedintheAPI tokencost. Therefore, it will beacompromisebetween a free open-source LLM using dedicated cloud infrastructure at moderate cost versusOpenAIperformanceinanall-in-oneAPI.\nFinally, we must consider that the fine-tuning is based on oneversionof ChatGPT(3.5). As newerversions of ChatGPT are released, it may be necessary toadapt our approachtomaintainoptimalperformance. We also expect that the current cost will decreaseinthefutureas data, architecture,and hardware improve following Moore's Law\n34\n. As technology advances, we anticipate that ourmethodwill becomeevenmorecost-effectiveandefficient, makingitanincreasinglyvaluabletool forthescientificcommunity.\nFuture\nWe may propose in future a fine tune version with an open LLM using this cleaner dataset andextendingtoalarger database.
