INTRODUCTION\nThe oil-immersed transformer is a vital component of the\npower grid, and they are responsible for the essential func-\ntions of power transmission and conversion. Once the fault\noccurs, it will cause substantial economic losses. Therefore,\ntransformer fault diagnosis is carried out to ﬁnd hidden faults\nin time and perform maintenance according to the type of\nfault. It is of great signiﬁcance to reduce the loss and harm\ncaused by transformer failure and improve the stable and reli-\nable operation of the power grid [1]. The oil-immersed trans-\nformer in normal operation produces a minimal amount of\ngas due to the ageing and cracking of the insulation and is dis-\nsolved in the transformer oil. The main components of these\ngases are hydrogen (H 2), methane (CH 4), ethane (C 2H4), and\nethylene. (C 2H2), acetylene (C 2H6), carbon monoxide (CO)\nand carbon dioxide (CO 2), etc. [2]. When transformers have\ndifferent faults, speciﬁc gas components will increase rapidly.\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Tallha Akram\n.\nFor example, when insulating oil is overheated, the ratio\nof CH 4 and C 2H4 will increase rapidly; during high-energy\ndischarge, the contents of H 2 and C 2H2 will increase. This\nshows the type and type of transformer faults. The change of\ngas composition shows a strong correlation. Dissolved Gas\nAnalysis (DGA) technology uses non-electrical quantities as\ndiagnostic indicators, is not affected by electromagnetics, has\ngood versatility, and is widely used in the online diagnosis of\noil-immersed transformers.\nSome experts proposed that The three-ratio [3], Rogers\nratio method [4], Duval triangle method [5], [6], and other\nrules formed based on DGA are simple and have played a sig-\nniﬁcant role. Still, they all have incomplete state coding and\nover-absolute coding limits. Such problems have certain lim-\nitations in practical applications [7]. In recent years, with the\ncontinuous development of artiﬁcial intelligence technology,\ndiagnostic methods have also developed from the traditional\nIEC three-ratio method and improved three-ratio method to\nmachine learning and other artiﬁcial intelligence methods,\nsuch as neural networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM),\n1522\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.\nFor more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ VOLUME 10, 2022\nJ. Liet al.: Transformer Fault Diagnosis Based on Multi-Class AdaBoost Algorithm\nFuzzy Algorithms, Bayesian theory, Normal cloud model\n[8]–[13], etc. Although these methods have achieved speciﬁc\ndiagnostic effects, they have also solved some of the problems\nof traditional algorithm boundaries that are too absolute and\neasy to overﬁt. However, due to transformer failure, The\ncomplex characteristics of the gas production mechanism, the\nsmall amount of sample data, and the low dimensionality\nof the sample data. The above-mentioned single machine\nlearning method cannot fully dig out the connection between\nthe transformer fault gas data, resulting in its mediocre effect\nin transformer fault diagnosis.\nIn response to this problem, the ensemble learning\nAdaBoost [14], [15] algorithm builds multiple weak classi-\nﬁers through multiple iterations, and affects the weight of\nthe next-generation classiﬁer samples according to the clas-\nsiﬁcation results, and performs deep mining of the samples\nby assigning different weights to the samples, and ﬁnally,\nweights V oting to produce a strong classiﬁer for transformer\nfault diagnosis. Zhou and others [16]–[18] used cloud diagno-\nsis model, decision tree algorithm, extreme learning machine,\netc., as weak classiﬁers, and then used AdaBoost algorithm\nfor transformer fault diagnosis. Although the AdaBoost algo-\nrithm increases the diversity of samples, due to the small\namount of fault samples of large oil-immersed transform-\ners, the accuracy of cloud models, decision trees and other\nalgorithms is related to the number of training samples,\nwhich restricts the further fault diagnosis performance. JI [19]\nproposes a BP-PSO-AdaBoost algorithm, which can effec-\ntively improve neural networks’ accuracy and convergence\nspeed. The SVM classiﬁer is made up of a small number\nof support vectors. Its complexity depends on the number\nof support vectors rather than the dimension of the sample\nspace. Even if the sample size is small, it can have a good\nclassiﬁcation effect, so it is widely used in transformer fault\ndata classiﬁcation. Application [20]. However, the setting\nof SVM hyperparameters requires prior empirical knowl-\nedge, and the optimal hyperparameter selection is still an\nopen issue in related research ﬁelds. Zhang [8] used the\nimproved krill algorithm and genetic algorithm to set the\nhyperparameters of SVM and achieved good results. Still,\nthe optimization efﬁciency and accuracy of hyperparameters\nneed to be improved. On this basis, this paper proposes an\nImproved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) to optimize\nSVM core parameters and penalty factors. It combines the\nAdaBoost algorithm with SVM to obtain multiple IPSO-\nSVM weak classiﬁers through iteration, And other conduct\nin-depth mining of transformer fault data to improve the\nclassiﬁcation effect of SVM.\nII. OIL-IMMERSED TRANSFORMER FAULT DIAGNOSIS\nMODEL\nAdaBoost and SVM algorithms are machine learning algo-\nrithms suitable for classiﬁcation. SVM is used as a weak clas-\nsiﬁer to pre-classify transformer fault data. However, it isn’t\neasy to have a good effect due to transformer fault data’s\ncomplex gas generation mechanism. We use the AdaBoost\nalgorithm to enhance SVM. The basic principle of the\nAdaBoost algorithm is to train multiple weak classiﬁers and\nassign a weight to each classiﬁer. The classiﬁcation results\nof all classiﬁers are combined by weighting to form A strong\nclassiﬁer. The key to this algorithm is how to train and assign\nweights to each weak classiﬁer fully.\nA. ADABOOST ALGORITHM\nAdaBoost trains the ﬁrst weak classiﬁer by assigning initial\nweights to the training samples. According to the classiﬁca-\ntion results of the weak classiﬁer samples after training, the\nsample weights are dynamically updated to make misclassi-\nﬁed samples receive more attention, and then based on the\noverall weak classiﬁer The test error is used to adjust the\nweight of the weak classiﬁer, so as to change the training\nprocess of the latter classiﬁer, and train all the classiﬁers\none by one, and obtain the strong classiﬁer according to the\nﬁnal weight of the weak classiﬁer. For a binary classiﬁca-\ntion model with T weak classiﬁers, when the number of\ntraining samples is n, the strong classiﬁer obtained by the\nintegration is:\nF (x)=sign (f (x))=sign\n( T∑\nt=1\nαt ht (x)\n)\n(1)\nIn the formula, αt is the weight of the weak classiﬁer, and\nht (x)is the classiﬁcation result of the weak classiﬁer.\nB. WEAK CLASSIFIER MODEL BASED ON SVM\nALGORITHM\nThe sample size of transformer fault data is small, the fault\ngas collection is complex, and the complicated gas produc-\ntion mechanism. Multi-layer machine learning algorithms\nsuch as neural networks have achieved good results in many\nﬁelds. Still they require a large amount of sample data and\nare unsuitable for transformers fault diagnosis, and SVM\nhas a good classiﬁcation effect on small samples of multi-\ndimensional data. The AdaBoost algorithm model based on\nthe SVM weak classiﬁer is shown in Figure 1.\nStandard SVM is a typical two-class classiﬁer, and\ntransformer fault diagnosis is a linear and inseparable multi-\nclassiﬁcation problem, so the nonlinear, multi-class trans-\nformation of SVM is required. SVM hopes to ﬁnd a\nhyperplane that can maximize classiﬁcation. While ensuring\nthe correct classiﬁcation, it also ensures that each sample\npoint can be far enough away from the hyperplane. For\nthis reason, the objective function of the SVM nonlinear\nmodel is:\nmin φ(ω,ξ)=1\n2 ∥ω∥2 +c\nl∑\ni=1\nξi\ns.t.\n{\nyi\n[\nωT ϕ(xi)+λ\n]\n≥1 −ξi\nξi ≥0, i =1,2,..., l (2)\nVOLUME 10, 2022 1523\nJ. Liet al.: Transformer Fault Diagnosis Based on Multi-Class AdaBoost Algorithm\nFIGURE 1. AdaBoost model.\nwhere ξi is the relaxation vector and c is the penalty factor,\nthe Lagrange function is as follows:\nL (ω,λ,ξ,α,β )=φ(ω,ξ)−\nl∑\ni=1\nαi\n×\n{\nyi\n[\nωT ϕ(xi)+λ\n]\n−1 +ξi\n}\n−\nl∑\ni=1\nβiξi (3)\nThe decision function of SVM is as follows:\nf (x)=sign\n[ l∑\ni=1\nαiyiK (x,xi)+λ\n]\n(4)\nwhere K (x,xi)is the kernel function. The commonly used\nkernel functions are radial basis function (RBF), polynomial\nfunction and so on. The RBF function only needs to determine\none parameter, which is conducive to optimising of param-\neters. Therefore, if RBF function is selected as the kernel\nfunction of SVM, the following results can be obtained:\nK (x,xi)=exp\n(\n−g ∥x −xi∥2\n)\n, g >0 (5)\nThere are ﬁve types of transformer fault, and SVM is only\na two classiﬁcation classiﬁer, so it is necessary to extend\nSVM to multi-classiﬁcation. Considering the complexity and\ndiversity of transformer fault data, it is difﬁcult to distin-\nguish all faults by one classiﬁcation. Multiple classiﬁcations\nare needed to distinguish all kinds of faults accurately. The\nexpansion mode of multi-classiﬁcation is shown in Figure 2.\nC. FAULT DIAGNOSIS MODEL OF OIL IMMERSED\nTRANSFORMER BASED ON BASIC ON\nMULTI-CLASS ADABOOST\nIn the AdaBoost model, each sample is given the same\ninitial weight and iterated many times. According to the\nerror of each weak classiﬁer, the weight coefﬁcient of the\nweak classiﬁer and the weight of the test sample is dynami-\ncally adjusted to increase the weight proportion of the clas-\nsiﬁcation error samples. The traditional AdaBoost model\nFIGURE 2. Multi-class extension.\nmainly gives weight to the two classiﬁcation samples. Due to\nthe diversity of transformer faults, the traditional AdaBoost\nmodel is improved, and a multi- classiﬁcation AdaBoost\nmodel is proposed to adapt to transformer faults.\nSet the transformer fault type as k, after training the\nt-th weak classiﬁer SVM t , ﬁrst verify the classiﬁer to ensure\nthat the classiﬁcation accuracy can meet the requirements of\nAdaBoost, and judge whether the sum of the weights of all\nsamples with correct classiﬁcation in each type of fault is\ngreater than the sum of the weights of other types of fault\nsamples.\nη[SVMt (xi)=j] ≥∀η [SVMt (xi)̸=j] (6)\nWhen RBF is selected as the kernel function, only two\nparameters of SVM need to be determined at this time, the\npenalty factor c in formula (3) and the kernel parameter g in\nformula (6).\nWhere ηis the sum of weights and ηis:\nη=\nn∑\ni=1\nDt (i) (7)\nwhere Dt (i) is the weight of training samples in the\ni-generation SVM. If formula (7) is not true, then retrain the\n1524 VOLUME 10, 2022\nJ. Liet al.: Transformer Fault Diagnosis Based on Multi-Class AdaBoost Algorithm\nweak classiﬁer. If formula (7) is true, Calculate the classiﬁ-\ncation error rate of SVMt to training set St :\nerrt =\nn∑\ni=1\nDi\nt I [SVMt (xi)̸=yi] (8)\nwhere I[∗] is the logical value, and then update the weak\nclassiﬁer weight αt according to the errt .\nαt =ln 1 −errt\nerrt\n+ln (K −1) (9)\nThen the next-generation training sample weight Dt+1 (i)can\nbe updated as:\nDt+1 (i)=Dt (i)\nZt\n·exp (αt ·I [SVMt (xi)̸=yi]) (10)\nwhere Zt is the normalization factor, which can be calculated\nas:\nZt =\nn∑\ni=1\nDt (i)·exp (αt ·I [SVMt (xi)̸=yi]) (11)\nAccording to formula 11, is adjusted by, so in the weak\nclassiﬁer, the wrongly classiﬁed sample will have a higher\nsample weight in the round of iterations. A weighted vote\nis performed on the results of each weak classiﬁer, and the\nstrong classiﬁer is integrated according to the weight of the\nweak classiﬁer. The ﬁnal classiﬁcation result is:\nF (x)=arg maxy∈Y\nT∑\nt=1\nαt ·[SVMt (xi)=y] (12)\nThe speciﬁc algorithm ﬂow is shown in Figure 3:\nIII. PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION OF WEAK CLASSIFIER\nBASED ON IMPROVED PARTICLE SWARM ALGORITHM\nThe parameter selection of SVM is related to its classiﬁ-\ncation accuracy. Selecting the appropriate super parameters\nin an extensive range is the core of SVM model optimiza-\ntion. In this paper, an Improved Particle Swarm Optimiza-\ntion (IPSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters\nof SVM to obtain the IPSO-SVM model.\nIn the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm,\neach particle searches the optimal solution individually in\nthe optimization space, recorded as the individual extremum\nand shared with other particles in the whole particle swarm.\nThe individual extremum with the optimal value is regarded\nas the current global optimal solution of the whole particle\nswarm. In the process of optimization, the search ability of\nthe algorithm is unstable, and it is easy to fall into the local\noptimum. It often needs multiple iterations to ﬁnd the optimal\nsolution. Its search ability depends on the inertia weight. The\nlarger the value is, the stronger the global search ability is, and\nthe smaller the value is, the stronger the local search ability\nis. The quantitative inertia weight of the traditional particle\nswarm optimization algorithm is improved to time-varying\ninertia weight, and the inertia weight is linearly reduced\nfrom the maximum value to the minimum value by using the\nFIGURE 3. Transformer fault diagnosis model.\nlinearly varying weight, so as to facilitate the accurate search\nof the current search area and facilitate the convergence of the\nalgorithm.\nFor the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm,\nin each iteration, the particle updates itself through two\nextrema Pbest and gbest , and the velocity and position of the\nparticle can be self updated as follows:\nvi =ω×vi +c1 ×rand() ×\n(\npbesti −xi\n)\n+c2 ×rand()\n×\n(\ngbesti −xi\n)\n(13)\nxi =xi +vi (14)\nwhere i = 1,2,··· ,n is the number of particle swarm,\nvi is the speed of the i-th particle, xi is the position of the\ni-th particle, c1,c2 are the learning factor, which determines\nthe search ability of particles, rand() is a random number\nbetween 0-1, ωis the inertia weight, which can be updated\nas follows:\nω=ωmax −m ∗(ωmax −ωmin)\nmmax\n(15)\nwhere m is the number of iterations. According to the for-\nmula, with the increase of the number of iterations m, the\nVOLUME 10, 2022 1525\nJ. Liet al.: Transformer Fault Diagnosis Based on Multi-Class AdaBoost Algorithm\nFIGURE 4. SVM weak classifier model based on IPSO.\ninertia weight ω will decrease. With the increase of the\nnumber of iterations, the search center of ipso algorithm will\nchange from global search to accurate search.\nThe classiﬁcation ability of the weak classiﬁer RBF-SVM\ndepends on the penalty factor c and the kernel parameter g.\nThe penalty factor c is the SVM’s tolerance to the relaxation\nvector. If the value is too small, the trainer will give up the\nclassiﬁcation of the relaxation vector and pay more attention\nto the whole sample. If the value is too large, it will pay\ntoo much attention to the relaxation vector and lead to the\nwrong classiﬁcation of other samples. The smaller the kernel\nparameter g is, the more detailed the classiﬁcation will be,\nthat is to say, the easier it will lead to overﬁtting; The larger\nthe size, the more careless the classiﬁcation will be, making\nit impossible to distinguish the data. In this paper, the param-\neters of RBF-SVM are optimized by the IPSO algorithm,\nand the IPSO-SVM weak classiﬁer model is established,\nas shown in Figure 4.\nIV. FEATURE VECTOR SELECTION\nDGA data of oil immersed transformer includes H 2, CH 4,\nC2H6, C 2H4, C 2H2, CO and CO 2. In order to reduce the\ninﬂuence of data error on diagnosis accuracy, the selection of\neigenvector is also very important. According to the power\ngrid equipment condition based maintenance regulations\nand ﬁeld experience, the characteristic gases produced by\noverheating fault are CH 4 and C 2H6, the sum of which gen-\nerally accounts for more than 80% of the total hydrocarbon\n[21], [22]. With the increase of fault point temperature, the\nproportion of C2H6 will increase. Generally, C2H2 will not be\nproduced when the temperature is below 200 ◦C [23]. When\nthe temperature is below 500 ◦C, the content of C 2H2 does\nnot exceed 2% of the total hydrocarbon. When the temper-\nature is seriously overheated, the content of C 2H2 does not\nexceed 6%. When the overheat fault involves solid insulating\nmaterials, in addition to the above gases, a lot of CO and CO 2\nare also produced [24], so CO and CO 2 have a great inﬂuence\non the overheat fault diagnosis results. High energy discharge\nfault gas production speed is fast, gas volume is large, fault\ncharacteristic gas is mainly C 2H2 and H2, followed by a large\nnumber of C 2H6 and CH4 [25], C2H2 generally accounts for\n20-70% of the total hydrocarbon, H 2 accounts for 30-90%,\nin most cases, C 2H6 content is higher than CH 4. Due to the\nlow discharge energy, the total hydrocarbon content of low-\nenergy discharge fault is generally low, and its main com-\nponent is H 2, followed by CH 4. When the discharge energy\ndensity increases, C2H2 will also be produced, but the propor-\ntion of C 2H2 in total hydrocarbon is generally less than 2%,\nwhich is the main difference between high-energy discharge\nfault and low-energy discharge fault [25]. According to\nDL/T 722-2000 and IEC 60599-2015, the internal faults of\ntransformers are divided into ﬁve types: medium and low\n1526 VOLUME 10, 2022\nJ. Liet al.: Transformer Fault Diagnosis Based on Multi-Class AdaBoost Algorithm\ntemperature overheating (T1-T2), high temperature overheat-\ning (T3), low energy discharge (D1), high energy discharge\n(D2) and partial discharge (PD). Based on the collected\n419 sets of domestic transformer fault data, the three-\ndimensional visualization of fault types and some DGA\nindexes is drawn, as shown in Figure 5. Fault types 1-5\nin the ﬁgure represent PD, D1, D2, T1, T2 and T3 faults\nrespectively. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the H 2\nconcentration of most discharge faults is very high, while\nthe distribution of thermal faults in the visualization dia-\ngram is relatively scattered, and there is no obvious rule.\nThe discharge fault can be judged by the H 2 concentration,\nand the CH 4 concentration produced by partial discharge\nis relatively low. Similarly, by drawing three-dimensional\nvisualization distribution maps of other DGA indexes, the\nconcentrations of C 2H6 and C2H2 can effectively distinguish\nhigh-energy discharge and low-energy discharge faults, the\ntemperature range of thermal fault can be determined by\nC2H2 concentration, the concentration of C 2H4 is higher in\nhigh-energy discharge and low-energy discharge faults, but\nthe contents of partial discharge and thermal fault are lower.\nAmong them, ﬁve kinds of gases H 2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4 and\nC2H2 are selected as eigenvectors, and their gas concentra-\ntions are recorded as C(H 2), C(CH4), C(C2H6), C(C2H4) and\nC(C2H2).\nFIGURE 5. Domestic data visualization.\nBecause of the large difference of the gas production,\nit may affect the accuracy of fault diagnosis directly as\nthe model input, so it is necessary to normalize the data\nand take the normalized gas concentration as the primary\nfeature.\nAlthough there is a certain relationship between different\ntypes of gas, only using the above normalized gas volume\nconcentration as the data feature can not obtain accurate fault\ndiagnosis results. In the ﬁeld of DGA fault diagnosis, gas\nfraction ratio is generally used to represent more extensive\nfeature information. Through a large number of experiments\nand literature review, the traditional ratio method is improved,\nand a new ratio method is proposed. The traditional ratio\nmethod usually needs coding, while the new ratio method\nonly needs gas concentration ratio. The relationship between\ncharacteristics and fault types can be better reﬂected by the\npercentage of key gas in total gas or total hydrocarbon con-\ncentration, The above gases were combined in nine ratios.\nThe DGA eigenvectors based on the new ratio method are\nshown in Table 1. Among them, features 1-3 are the three\nratios of the three ratio method, and features 4-7 are the ratios\nof four kinds of carbonaceous gases CH 4, C 2H2, C 2H4 and\nC2H6 to total hydrocarbon respectively. The ratio of single\ngas to total hydrocarbon concentration can better reﬂect the\nrelationship between various fault types. For example, the\npercentage content of C 2H2 can determine which overheating\nfault the transformer is in, In feature 8-9, C 2H4 concentration\nand CH 4 concentration can effectively distinguish partial\ndischarge and other two kinds of discharge faults. The con-\ncentration of H 2 is the key to distinguish all discharge faults,\nLet Cn (Cx Hx )be the total concentration of all carbonaceous\ngases.\nCn (Cx Hx )=Cn (CH4)+Cn (C2H2)+Cn (C2H4)\n+Cn (C2H6) (16)\nThe ﬁrst part of the simulation experiment ﬁrst introduces\nthe type of transformer data used in the simulation and its\nsource; The second part uses the global search algorithm and\nthe IPSO algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters of the\nSVM. The purpose is to better exert the classiﬁcation ability\nof the weak classiﬁer SVM, and compare the Grey Wolf Opti-\nmizer(GWO) and PSO Algorithm illustrates the superiority of\nIPSO algorithm; The third part compares different input fea-\nture vectors to illustrate the superiority of the improved ratio\nmethod; the fourth part combines the AdaBoost algorithm\nwith the SVM optimized by the IPSO algorithm to the ﬁnal\nclassiﬁcation model and compares it with the model proposed\nin the literature.\nA. EXAMPLE SAMPLE\nTransformer faults are divided into internal faults and exter-\nnal faults. The article mainly studies the ﬁve types of\ninternal faults deﬁned in DL/T 722-2000 guidelines and\nIEC 60599-2015. The sample of the calculation example is\n117 sets of IECTC10 standard data and 419 sets of trans-\nformer fault data collected in China. During the simulation,\nthe 117 sets of IECTC10 fault data are divided into two parts,\nincluding 87 training samples and 30 test samples, which\nare used to test and compare AdaBoost The classiﬁcation\nability and fault diagnosis performance of the algorithm, and\nthe generalization performance of the diagnosis algorithm is\nveriﬁed through 419 sets of transformer fault data in China.\nTable 2 shows the distribution of fault types in the IEC TC\n10 standard data set and the domestic 419 sets of transformer\nfault data sets.\nB.

The logarithmic form of is the\ncoordinate axis, and the curve plane and contour map of\nthe model diagnosis accuracy rate at different parameters\nare shown in Figure 6. In the ﬁgure, the deeper the yel-\nlow, the higher the SVM model diagnosis accuracy rate,\nand the optimization of SVM parameters The better the\neffect, the darker the purple, the lower the diagnostic accuracy\nof SVM.\nBased on Figure 6, it can be seen that the training effect\nis generally better when the penalty factor is [2 3, 2 10], and\nthe optimal value of the kernel parameter is [2 −5, 2 5]. This\nrange is used as the boundary of the IPSO algorithm for\noptimization.\nThe proposed IPSO algorithm is used to accurately opti-\nmize the SVM parameters. The parameters of the IPSO\nalgorithm during simulation are initialized as follows: the\npopulation size is 50, the maximum number of iterations\nis 50, the learning factor C 1 is 1.5, C 2 is 1.7, and the ωmax\nis 0.9. The ωmin is 0.4. The curve of the number of iterations\nand ﬁtness is shown in Figure 7.\nIt can be seen from Figure 7 that in the initial iteration of the\nIPSO algorithm, the inertia weight takes the maximum value.\nAt this time, the search center of gravity is searching for the\nwhole world. With the increase of the number of iterations,\nthe weight will decrease, and the local optimization ability\nwill be gradually strengthened to beneﬁt the algorithm.

And use ﬁve-fold cross-validation to further\nincrease the credibility of the results.\nFIGURE 8. Different optimization algorithms comparison.\nIt can be seen from Figure 8 that the accuracy of the three\nalgorithms are similar. Among them, The traditional PSO has\nthe lowest diagnosis accuracy and convergence speed among\nthe three algorithms. The IPSO algorithm has the highest\naccuracy, and the convergence is relatively fast, and the most\nstable. Therefore, it can be concluded that the IPSO algorithm\nis much better than the PSO algorithm.\nC. DGA FEATUREVECTOR OPTIMIZATION SIMULATION\nFrom the extensive analysis in the third chapter, it can be\nseen that the direct fault diagnosis of the DGA raw data\nwill lead to the low diagnosis accuracy of the model. This\narticle compares the inﬂuence of different feature vectors on\nthe accuracy of fault diagnosis, and ﬁrst divides the input\nfeature vectors into three types: (1) DGA full data, including\nTABLE 3. AdaBoost algorithm validation accuracy.\nH2,CH4,C2H2,C2H6,C2H4,CO,CO2, and total hydrocar-\nbons; (2) the three-ratio characteristic quantity is composed\nof CH4/H2, C2H4/C2H6 and C2H2/C2H4; (3) the improved\nratio method proposed in this article. Then, the fault diagnosis\nmethod based on the IPSO-SVM multi-class AdaBoost pro-\nposed in this paper is used as a model, and the fault diagnosis\naccuracy curve with three different input feature vectors is\nshown in Figure 10. Among them, the green line, red line,\nand blue line respectively represent the diagnosis accuracy\nrate of the improved ratio method, the three ratio method and\nthe DGA gas as the input feature vector.\nFIGURE 9. Comparison of different feature.\nFigure 9 shows that with the improved ratio method as\nthe input feature vector, the error is minimized and sta-\nbilized after several iterations of the algorithm. Compared\nwith the traditional three ratio method and the DGA feature\ngas feature vector, the diagnosis is more accurate and the\nnumber of iterations is also greater. Less, the convergence\nspeed is faster and more stable. The correct rate of trans-\nformer fault diagnosis obtained by the three methods is shown\nin Table 3.\nIt can be seen from Table 3 that the accuracy rate of\nthe improved ratio method is 30% higher than that of the\nDGA full data and 16.7% higher than the three ratio method,\nindicating that the improved ratio method can signiﬁcantly\nimprove the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis and\nhas better stability for fault diagnosis, And can effectively\nreduce the interference caused by different data, verifying the\neffectiveness of the proposed improved ratio method as the\ninput feature vector.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 1529\nJ.

FAULT DIAGNOSIS SIMULATION BASED ON IPASO-SVM\nMULTI-CLASS ADABOOST\nSelect the hyperparameters according to the optimization\nmethod in Section 4.2, set the number of weak classiﬁers\nto 50, and use the improved ratio method as the feature\nvector to train the IPSO-SVM multi-class AdaBoost model.\nAt the same time, in order to verify the performance of\nthe proposed method, based on the same improved ratio\nThe method is the feature vector, and the decision tree,\nIPSO-SVM, AdaBoost-DT, PSO-SVM algorithm is used for\nfault diagnosis, and the diagnosis result is shown in Figure 10.\nThe ordinates 1-5 in the ﬁgure indicate PD, D1, D2, T1\\T2,\nand T3 failures respectively.\nIt can be seen from Figure 10 that the overall diagnosis\neffect of the AdaBoost model based on the SVM classiﬁer\nis better than the diagnosis effect based on the decision tree\nmodel. The AdaBoost model based on the SVM classiﬁer has\na poor classiﬁcation effect on high temperature faults and low\n1530 VOLUME 10, 2022\nJ. Liet al.: Transformer Fault Diagnosis Based on Multi-Class AdaBoost Algorithm\nenergy discharge faults. The AdaBoost model is less effective\nin classifying high-energy discharges and partial discharges.\nSummarizing the correct fault diagnosis of the four methods,\nit can be seen that after the decision tree is enhanced by\nthe AdaBoost algorithm, its correct rate is 86.7%, which is\nan increase of 20% compared with the 66.7% before the\nenhancement. After the IPSO-SVM algorithm proposed in\nthis paper is enhanced by the multi-class AdaBoost algorithm,\nits diagnostic accuracy is up to 90%, which is 6.7% higher\nthan the pure IPSO-SVM algorithm, and 3.3% higher than\nthe traditional version of AdaBoost-DT and AdaBoost-PSO-\nSVM. It shows that the multi-class AdaBoost model based\non IPSO-SVM has better fault diagnosis performance. At the\nsame time, it can also be seen that the performance of the\nIPSO algorithm is better than that of the PSO algorithm.\nUsing the IPSO-SVM-based multi-class AdaBoost algo-\nrithm proposed in this article, the ﬁve-fold cross-validation\nmethod is used to simulate and analyze the collected domes-\ntic 419 sets of transformer fault data. and the same 419 sets\nare used The transformer fault data is compared with the\nAdaBoost-PSO-SVM algorithm, and the diagnosis results\nand correct rates of different fault types are shown in\nFigure 11.\nFIGURE 11. Generalization testing.\nIt can be seen from Figure 11 that compared with the\nAdaBoost-PSO-SVM algorithm, the enhanced AdaBoost-\nIPSO-SVM model has signiﬁcantly improved the diagnostic\naccuracy of the ﬁve types of faults, and its diagnostic accu-\nracy of the domestic transformer fault data is 87.1%, which is\nsimilar to the IEC TC 10 fault data, which again veriﬁes the\nreliability and validity of the multi-class AdaBoost model of\nIPSO-SVM proposed in this paper.\nV. SUMMARIZE\nIn this paper, the AdaBoost algorithm is used to enhance\nthe improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) optimized\nsupport vector machine (SVM) transformer fault diagnosis\nmodel.\nAnd by analyzing the relationship between the dissolved\ngas in the transformer oil and the fault type, applying the\nuncoded ratio method to form a new gas combination as the\ncharacteristic parameters of the fault model, and establishing\nan improved ratio method as the input feature vector, through\nthe IEC TC 10 data set Perform fault diagnosis with domestic\ntransformer data.\n(1) The IPSO-SVM fault diagnosis model enhanced by the\nAdaBoost algorithm can effectively and accurately identify\nthe type of transformer fault. Compared with the traditional\nSVM and AdaBoost algorithm, it shows higher classiﬁcation\naccuracy.\n(2) The traditional PSO algorithm is easy to fall into the\nphenomenon of local optimum and premature convergence\nduring the optimization process. By introducing linearly\ndecreasing weights to replace the quantitative weights of the\ntraditional PSO algorithm, the search performance of the\nPSO algorithm is enhanced. By comparing the traditional\nPSO algorithm, the IPSO algorithm shows its stronger search\nability.\n(3) Through the analysis of the DGA fault data, the\nimproved ratio method proposed has a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in accuracy compared with the traditional ratio method\nand the DGA fault gas data.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y .
