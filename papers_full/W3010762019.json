  "abstract": "This paper describes the approach to the frequency response modelling of transformer windings consisting of coils connected in parallel. At present, computer models are intensively developed with the aim of simulating the influence of faults on the frequency response of the active part of power transformers. Frequency response analysis (FRA) is one of the standard methods used for the assessment of the mechanical condition of a transformer’s windings and core. The interpretation of the FRA results is crucial in the diagnostics of the active part of the transformer. Proper simulations of the FRA results allow the improvement and simplification of the interpretation process of the windings’ faults. Usually only serial winding wires are simulated in computer modelling and parallel wires are simplified, leading to simulation inaccuracies. In this work, a combined electromagnetic field/network method, which includes parallel connections of the coils, is proposed. The method is based on lumped RLC elements. The results of the analysis conducted by the computer model are referred to as the real transformer measurement. The modelling was also performed for the case of a winding with a fault. The results of modelling were assessed with four numerical indices used for FRA interpretation.",
