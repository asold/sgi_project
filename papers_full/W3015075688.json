Introduction\nSign Languages are the native languages of the Deaf and\ntheir main medium of communication. As visual languages,\nthey utilize multiple complementary channels1 to convey in-\nformation [62]. This includes manual features, such as hand\nshape, movement and pose as well as non-manuals features,\nsuch as facial expression, mouth and movement of the head,\nshoulders and torso [5].\nThe goal of sign language translation is to either convert\nwritten language into a video of sign (production) [59, 60]\nor to extract an equivalent spoken language sentence from\na video of someone performing continuous sign [9]. How-\never, in the ﬁeld of computer vision, much of this latter work\n1Linguists refer to these channels as articulators.\nSpatial Embedding Word Embedding\nShifted Spoken Language Words\nSIGN LANGUAGE GLOSSES\nSpoken Language Sentence\nConnectionist Temporal Classification\nTransformer Encoder\nTransformer Encoder Transformer Decoder\nTransformer Decoder\nSLRT SLTT\nFigure 1: An overview of our end-to-end Sign Language\nRecognition and Translation approach using transformers.\nhas focused on recognising the sequence of sign glosses 2\n(Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)) rather\nthan the full translation to a spoken language equivalent\n(Sign Language Translation (SLT)). This distinction is im-\nportant as the grammar of sign and spoken languages are\nvery different. These differences include (to name a few):\ndifferent word ordering, multiple channels used to convey\nconcurrent information and the use of direction and space\nto convey the relationships between objects. Put simply, the\nmapping between speech and sign is complex and there is\nno simple word-to-sign mapping.\nGenerating spoken language sentences given sign lan-\nguage videos is therefore a spatio-temporal machine trans-\nlation task [9]. Such a translation system requires us to ac-\ncomplish several sub-tasks, which are currently unsolved:\nSign Segmentation: Firstly, the system needs to detect\nsign sentences, which are commonly formed using topic-\ncomment structures [62], from continuous sign language\nvideos. This is trivial to achieve for text based machine\ntranslation tasks [48], where the models can use punctua-\ntion marks to separate sentences. Speech-based recogni-\ntion and translation systems, on the other hand, look for\npauses, e.g. silent regions, between phonemes to segment\nspoken language utterances [69, 76]. There have been stud-\nies in the literature addressing automatic sign segmentation\n[36, 52, 55, 4, 13]. However to the best of the authors’\nknowledge, there is no study which utilizes sign segmenta-\ntion for realizing continuous sign language translation.\n2Sign glosses are spoken language words that match the meaning of\nsigns and, linguistically, manifest as minimal lexical items.\narXiv:2003.13830v1  [cs.CV]  30 Mar 2020\nSign Language Recognition and Understanding:Fol-\nlowing successful segmentation, the system needs to under-\nstand what information is being conveyed within a sign sen-\ntence. Current approaches tackle this by recognizing sign\nglosses and other linguistic components. Such methods can\nbe grouped under the banner of CSLR [40, 8]. From a com-\nputer vision perspective, this is the most challenging task.\nConsidering the input of the system is high dimensional\nspatio-temporal data, i.e. sign videos, models are required\nthat understand what a signer looks like and how they in-\nteract and move within their 3D signing space. Moreover,\nthe model needs to comprehend what these aspects mean in\ncombination. This complex modelling problem is exacer-\nbated by the asynchronous multi-articulatory nature of sign\nlanguages [51, 58]. Although there have been promising re-\nsults towards CSLR, the state-of-the-art [39] can only rec-\nognize sign glosses and operate within a limited domain of\ndiscourse, namely weather forecasts [26].\nSign Language Translation:Once the information em-\nbedded in the sign sentences is understood by the system,\nthe ﬁnal step is to generate spoken language sentences. As\nwith any other natural language, sign languages have their\nown unique linguistic and grammatical structures, which\noften do not have a one-to-one mapping to their spoken\nlanguage counterparts. As such, this problem truly repre-\nsents a machine translation task. Initial studies conducted\nby computational linguists have used text-to-text statistical\nmachine translation models to learn the mapping between\nsign glosses and their spoken language translations [45].\nHowever, glosses are simpliﬁed representations of sign lan-\nguages and linguists are yet to come to a consensus on how\nsign languages should be annotated.\nThere have been few contributions towards video based\ncontinuous SLT, mainly due to the lack of suitable\ndatasets to train such models. More recently, Camgoz\net al . [9] released the ﬁrst publicly available sign lan-\nguage video to spoken language translation dataset, namely\nPHOENIX14T. In their work, the authors proposed ap-\nproaching SLT as a Neural Machine Translation (NMT)\nproblem. Using attention-based NMT models [44, 3], they\ndeﬁne several SLT tasks and realized the ﬁrst end-to-end\nsign language video to spoken language sentence transla-\ntion model, namely Sign2Text.\nOne of the main ﬁndings of [9] was that using gloss\nbased mid-level representations improved the SLT per-\nformance drastically when compared to an end-to-end\nSign2Text approach. The resulting Sign2Gloss2Text model\nﬁrst recognized glosses from continuous sign videos using\na state-of-the-art CSLR method [41], which worked as a\ntokenization layer. The recognized sign glosses were then\npassed to a text-to-text attention-based NMT network [44]\nto generate spoken language sentences.\nWe hypothesize that there are two main reasons why\nSign2Gloss2Text performs better than Sign2Text (18.13 vs\n9.58 BLEU-4 scores). Firstly, the number of sign glosses\nis much lower than the number of frames in the videos\nthey represent. By using gloss representations instead of\nthe spatial embeddings extracted from the video frames,\nSign2Gloss2Text avoids the long-term dependency issues,\nwhich Sign2Text suffers from.\nWe think the second and more critical reason is the\nlack of direct guidance for understanding sign sentences\nin Sign2Text training. Given the aforementioned complex-\nity of the task, it might be too difﬁcult for current Neu-\nral Sign Language Translation architectures to comprehend\nsign without any explicit intermediate supervision. In this\npaper we propose a novel Sign Language Transformer ap-\nproach, which addresses this issue while avoiding the need\nfor a two-step pipeline, where translation is solely depen-\ndent on recognition accuracy. This is achieved by jointly\nlearning sign language recognition and translation from\nspatial-representations of sign language videos in an end-to-\nend manner. Exploiting the encoder-decoder based archi-\ntecture of transformer networks [70], we propose a multi-\ntask formalization of the joint continuous sign language\nrecognition and translation problem.\nTo help our translation networks with sign language un-\nderstanding and to achieve CSLR, we introduce a Sign Lan-\nguage Recognition Transformer (SLRT), an encoder trans-\nformer model trained using a CTC loss [2], to predict sign\ngloss sequences. SLRT takes spatial embeddings extracted\nfrom sign videos and learns spatio-temporal representa-\ntions. These representations are then fed to the Sign Lan-\nguage Translation Transformer (SLTT), an autoregressive\ntransformer decoder model, which is trained to predict one\nword at a time to generate the corresponding spoken lan-\nguage sentence. An overview of the approach can be seen\nin Figure 1.\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as:\n•A novel multi-task formalization of CSLR and SLT\nwhich exploits the supervision power of glosses, with-\nout limiting the translation to spoken language.\n•The ﬁrst successful application of transformers for\nCSLR and SLT which achieves state-of-the-art results\nin both recognition and translation accuracy, vastly\noutperforming all comparable previous approaches.\n•A broad range of new baseline results to guide future\nresearch in this ﬁeld.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Sec-\ntion 2, we survey the previous studies on SLT and the state-\nof-the-art in the ﬁeld of NMT. In Section 3, we introduce\nSign Language Transformers, a novel joint sign language\nrecognition and translation approach which can be trained\nin an end-to-end manner. We share our experimental setup\nin Section 4. We then report quantitative results of the Sign\nLanguage Transformers in Section 5 and present new base-\nline results for the previously deﬁned text-to-text translation\ntasks [9]. In Section 6, we share translation examples gen-\nerated by our network to give the reader further qualitative\ninsight of how our approach performs. We conclude the\npaper in Section 7 by discussing our ﬁndings and possible\nfuture work.\n2. Related Work\nSign languages have been studied by the computer\nvision community for the last three decades [65, 56]. The\nend goal of computational sign language research is to\nbuild translation and production systems [16], that are\ncapable of translating sign language videos to spoken\nlanguage sentences and vice versa, to ease the daily lives\nof the Deaf [15, 6]. However, most of the research to date\nhas mainly focused on Isolated Sign Language Recognition\n[35, 75, 72, 10, 63, 67], working on application speciﬁc\ndatasets [11, 71, 23], thus limiting the applicability of such\ntechnologies. More recent work has tackled continuous\ndata [42, 32, 17, 18], but the move from recognition to\ntranslation is still in its infancy [9].\nThere have been earlier attempts to realize SLT by com-\nputational linguists. However, existing work has solely fo-\ncused on the text-to-text translation problem and has been\nvery limited in size, averaging around 3000 total words\n[46, 57, 54]. Using statistical machine translation meth-\nods, Stein et al. [57] proposed a weather broadcast trans-\nlation system from spoken German into German Sign Lan-\nguage - Deutsche Gebrdensprache (DGS) and vice versa,\nusing the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2012 (PHOENIX12)\n[25] dataset. Another method translated air travel infor-\nmation from spoken English to Irish Sign Language (ISL),\nspoken German to ISL, spoken English to DGS, and spo-\nken German to DGS [45]. Ebling [22] developed an ap-\nproach to translate written German train announcements\ninto Swiss German Sign Language - Deutschschweizer\nGeb¨ardensprache (DSGS). While non-manual information\nhas not been included in most previous systems, Ebling &\nHuenerfauth [24] proposed a sequence classiﬁcation based\nmodel to schedule the automatic generation of non-manual\nfeatures after the core machine translation step.\nConceptual video based SLT systems were introduced in\nthe early 2000s [7]. There have been studies, such as [12],\nwhich propose recognizing signs in isolation and then con-\nstructing sentences using a language model. However, end-\nto-end SLT from video has not been realized until recently.\nThe most important obstacle to vision based SLT re-\nsearch has been the availability of suitable datasets. Cu-\nrating and annotating continuous sign language videos with\nspoken language translations is a laborious task. There\nare datasets available from linguistic sources [53, 31] and\nsign language interpretations from broadcasts [14]. How-\never, the available annotations are either weak (subtitles) or\ntoo few to build models which would work on a large do-\nmain of discourse. In addition, such datasets lack the hu-\nman pose information which legacy Sign Language Recog-\nnition (SLR) methods heavily relied on.\nThe relationship between sign sentences and their spo-\nken language translations are non-monotonic, as they have\ndifferent ordering. Also, sign glosses and linguistic con-\nstructs do not necessarily have a one-to-one mapping with\ntheir spoken language counterparts. This made the use of\navailable CSLR methods [42, 41] (that were designed to\nlearn from weakly annotated data) infeasible, as they are\nbuild on the assumption that sign language videos and cor-\nresponding annotations share the same temporal order.\nTo address these issues, Camgoz et al . [9] released\nthe ﬁrst publicly available SLT dataset, PHOENIX14 T,\nwhich is an extension of the popular RWTH-PHOENIX-\nWeather-2014 (PHOENIX14) CSLR dataset. The authors\napproached the task as a spatio-temporal neural machine\ntranslation problem, which they term ‘Neural Sign Lan-\nguage Translation’. They proposed a system using Con-\nvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in combination with\nattention-based NMT methods [44, 3] to realize the ﬁrst\nend-to-end SLT models. Following this, Ko et al . pro-\nposed a similar approach but used body key-point coordi-\nnates as input for their translation networks, and evaluated\ntheir method on a Korean Sign Language dataset [38].\nConcurrently, there have been several advancements in\nthe ﬁeld of NMT, one of the most important being the intro-\nduction of transformer networks [70]. Transformers dras-\ntically improved the translation performance over legacy\nattention based encoder-decoder approaches. Also due to\nthe fully-connected nature of the architecture, transformers\nare fast and easy to parallelize, which has enabled them\nto become the new go to architecture for many machine\ntranslation tasks. In addition to NMT, transformers have\nachieved success in various other challenging tasks, such as\nlanguage modelling [19, 77], learning sentence representa-\ntions [21], multi-modal language understanding [68], activ-\nity [73] and speech recognition [34]. Inspired by their re-\ncent wide-spread success, in this work we propose a novel\narchitecture where multiple co-dependent transformer net-\nworks are simultaneously trained to jointly solve related\ntasks. We then apply this architecture to the problem of si-\nmultaneous recognition and translation where joint training\nprovides signiﬁcant beneﬁts.\n3. Sign Language Transformers\nIn this section we introduce Sign Language Transform-\ners which jointly learn to recognize and translate sign video\nsequences into sign glosses and spoken language sentences\nin an end-to-end manner. Our objective is to learn the con-\nditional probabilities p(G|V) and p(S|V) of generating a\nsign gloss sequence G= (g1,...,g N) with N glosses and a\nspoken language sentence S= (w1,...,w U) with U words\ngiven a sign video V= (I1,...,I T) with T frames.\nModelling these conditional probabilities is a sequence-\nto-sequence task, and poses several challenges. In both\ncases, the number of tokens in the source domain is much\nlarger than the corresponding target sequence lengths ( i.e.\nT ≫N and T ≫U). Furthermore, the mapping between\nsign language videos, V, and spoken language sentences,S,\nis non-monotonic, as both languages have different vocabu-\nlaries, grammatical rules and orderings.\nPrevious sequence-to-sequence based literature on SLT\ncan be categorized into two groups: The ﬁrst group break\ndown the problem in two stages.

However, in doing so, this approach introduces\nan information bottleneck in the mid-level gloss represen-\ntation. This limits the network’s ability to understand sign\nlanguage as the translation model can only be as good as the\nsign gloss annotations it was trained from. There is also an\ninherent loss of information as a sign gloss is an incomplete\nannotation intended only for linguistic study and it therefore\nneglects many crucial details and information present in the\noriginal sign language video.\nThe second group of methods focus on translation from\nthe sign video representations to spoken language with no\nintermediate representation [9, 38]. These approaches at-\ntempt to learn p(S|V) directly. Given enough data and a\nsufﬁciently sophisticated network architecture, such mod-\nels could theoretically realize end-to-end SLT with no need\nfor a human-interpretable information that act as a bottle-\nneck. However, due to the lack of direct supervision guid-\ning sign language understanding, such methods have signif-\nicantly lower performance than their counterparts on cur-\nrently available datasets [9].\nTo address this, we propose to jointly learn p(G|V) and\np(S|V), in an end-to-end manner. We build upon trans-\nformer networks [70] to create a uniﬁed model, which\nwe call Sign Language Transformers (See Figure 2). We\ntrain our networks to generate spoken language sentences\nfrom sign language video representations. During training,\nwe inject intermediate gloss supervision in the form of a\nCTC loss into the Sign Language Recognition Transformer\n(SLRT) encoder. This helps our networks learn more mean-\ningful spatio-temporal representations of the sign without\nlimiting the information passed to the decoder. We em-\nploy an autoregressive Sign Language Translation Trans-\nformer (SLTT) decoder which predicts one word at a time\nto generate the spoken language sentence translation.\n3.1. Spatial and Word Embeddings\nFollowing the classic NMT pipeline, we start by embed-\nding our source and target tokens, namely sign language\nvideo frames and spoken language words. As word embed-\nding we use a linear layer, which is initialized from scratch\nduring training, to project a one-hot-vector representation of\nthe words into a denser space. To embed video frames, we\nuse the SpatialEmbedding approach [9], and propagate each\nimage through CNNs. We formulate these operations as:\nmu = WordEmbedding(wu)\nft = SpatialEmbedding(It) (1)\nwhere mu is the embedded representation of the spoken\nlanguage word wu and ft corresponds to the non-linear\nframe level spatial representation obtained from a CNN.\nUnlike other sequence-to-sequence models [61, 27],\ntransformer networks do not employ recurrence or convo-\nlutions, thus lacking the positional information within se-\nquences. To address this issue we follow the positional en-\ncoding method proposed in [70] and add temporal ordering\ninformation to our embedded representations as:\nˆft = ft + PositionalEncoding(t)\nˆmu = mu + PositionalEncoding(u)\nwhere PositionalEncoding is a predeﬁned function which\nproduces a unique vector in the form of a phase shifted sine\nwave for each time step.\n3.2. Sign Language Recognition Transformers\nThe aim of SLRT is to recognize glosses from continu-\nous sign language videos while learning meaningful spatio-\ntemporal representations for the end goal of sign language\ntranslation. Using the positionally encoded spatial embed-\ndings, ˆf1:T, we train a transformer encoder model [70].\nThe inputs to SLRT are ﬁrst modelled by a Self-\nAttention layer which learns the contextual relationship be-\ntween the frame representations of a video. Outputs of the\nself-attention are then passed through a non-linear point-\nwise feed forward layer. All the operations are followed by\nresidual connections and normalization to help training. We\nformulate this encoding process as:\nzt = SLRT(ˆft|ˆf1:T) (2)\nwhere zt denotes the spatio-temporal representation of the\nframe It, which is generated by SLRT at time step t, given\nthe spatial representations of all of the video frames, ˆf1:T.\nWe inject intermediate supervision to help our networks\nunderstand sign and to guide them to learn a meaningful\nsign representation which helps with the main task of trans-\nlation. We train the SLRT to modelp(G|V) and predict sign\nglosses. Due to the spatio-temporal nature of the signs,\nglosses have a one-to-many mapping to video frames but\nshare the same ordering.\nOne way to train the SLRT would be using cross-entropy\nloss [29] with frame level annotations. However, sign\ngloss annotations with such precision are rare. An alter-\nnative form of weaker supervision is to use a sequence-to-\nsequence learning loss functions, such as CTC [30].\nGiven spatio-temporal representations, z1:T, we obtain\nframe level gloss probabilities, p(gt|V), using a linear pro-\njection layer followed by a softmax activation. We then use\nCTC to compute p(G|V) by marginalizing over all possible\nVto Galignments as:\np(G|V) =\n∑\nπ∈B\np(π|V) (3)\nwhere π is a path and Bare the set of all viable paths that\ncorrespond to G. We then use the p(G|V) to calculate the\nCSLR loss as:\nLR = 1−p(G∗|V) (4)\nwhere G∗is the ground truth gloss sequence.\n3.3. Sign Language Translation Transformers\nThe end goal of our approach is to generate spoken lan-\nguage sentences from sign video representations. We pro-\npose training an autoregressive transformer decoder model,\nnamed SLTT, which exploits the spatio-temporal represen-\ntations learned by the SLRT. We start by preﬁxing the target\nspoken language sentence Swith the special beginning of\nsentence token, <bos >. We then extract the positionally\nencoded word embeddings. These embeddings are passed\nto a masked self-attention layer. Although the main idea be-\nhind self-attention is the same as in SLRT, the SLTT utilizes\na mask over the self-attention layer inputs. This ensures that\neach token may only use its predecessors while extracting\ncontextual information. This masking operation is neces-\nsary, as at inference time the SLTT won’t have access to the\noutput tokens which would follow the token currently being\ndecoded.\nRepresentations extracted from both SLRT and SLTT\nself-attention layers are combined and given to an encoder-\ndecoder attention module which learns the mapping\nbetween source and target sequences. Outputs of the\nencoder-decoder attention are then passed through a\nnon-linear point-wise feed forward layer. Similar to SLRT,\nall the operations are followed by residual connections and\nnormalization. We formulate this decoding process as:\nhu+1 = SLTT( ˆmu|ˆm1:u−1,z1:T). (5)\nSLTT learns to generate one word at a time until it produces\nthe special end of sentence token, <eos >. It is trained\nby decomposing the sequence level conditional probability\np(S|V) into ordered conditional probabilities\np(S|V) =\nU∏\nu=1\np(wu|hu) (6)\nwhich are used to calculate the cross-entropy loss for each\nword as:\nLT = 1−\nU∏\nu=1\nD∑\nd=1\np( ˆwd\nu)p(wd\nu|hu) (7)\nwhere p( ˆwd\nu) represents the ground truth probability of\nword wd at decoding step u and D is the target language\nvocabulary size.\nWe train our networks by minimizing the joint loss term\nL, which is a weighted sum of the recognition loss LR and\nthe translation loss LT as:\nL= λRLR + λTLT (8)\nwhere λR and λT are hyper parameters which decides the\nimportance of each loss function during training and are\nevaluated in Section 5.\n4. Dataset and Translation Protocols\nWe evaluate our approach on the recently released\nPHOENIX14T dataset [9], which is a large vocabulary, con-\ntinuous SLT corpus. PHOENIX14T is a translation focused\nextension of the PHOENIX14 corpus, which has become\nthe primary benchmark for CSLR in recent years.\nPHOENIX14T contains parallel sign language videos,\ngloss annotations and their translations, which makes it the\nonly available dataset suitable for training and evaluating\njoint SLR and SLT techniques. The corpus includes uncon-\nstrained continuous sign language from 9 different signers\nwith a vocabulary of 1066 different signs. Translations for\nthese videos are provided in German spoken language with\na vocabulary of 2887 different words.\nThe evaluation protocols on the PHOENIX14 T dataset,\nas laid down by [9], are as follows:\nSign2Text is the end goal of SLT, where the objective\nis to translate directly from continuous sign videos to spo-\nken language sentences without going via any intermediary\nrepresentation, such as glosses.\nGloss2Text is a text-to-text translation problem, where\nthe objective is to translate ground truth sign gloss se-\nquences to German spoken language sentences. The re-\nsults of these experiments act as a virtual upper bound for\nthe available NMT translation technology. This assump-\ntion is based on the fact that perfect sign language recog-\nnition/understanding is simulated by using the ground truth\ngloss annotation. However, as mentioned earlier, one needs\nto bear in mind that gloss representations are imprecise.\nAs glosses are textual representations of multi-channel tem-\nporal signals, they represent an information bottleneck for\nany translation system. This means that under ideal con-\nditions, a Sign2Text system could and should outperform\nGloss2Text. However, more sophisticated network architec-\ntures and data are needed to achieve this and hence such a\ngoal remains a longer term objective beyond the scope of\nthis manuscript.\nSign2Gloss2Text is the current state-of-the-art in SLT.\nThis approach utilizes CSLR models to extract gloss se-\nquences from sign language videos which are then used to\nsolve the translation task as a text-to-text problem by train-\ning a Gloss2Text network using the CSLR predictions.\nSign2Gloss→Gloss2Text is similar to Sign2Gloss2Text\nand also uses CSLR models to extract gloss sequences.\nHowever, instead of training text-to-text translation net-\nworks from scratch, Sign2Gloss→Gloss2Text models use\nthe best performing Gloss2Text network, which has been\ntrained with ground truth gloss annotations, to generate spo-\nken language sentences from intermediate sign gloss se-\nquences from the output of the CSLR models.\nIn addition to evaluating our networks in the context\nof the above protocols, we additionally introduce two\nnew protocols which follow the same naming convention.\nSign2Gloss is a protocol which essentially performs CSLR,\nwhile Sign2(Gloss+Text) requires joint learning of contin-\nuous sign language recognition and translation.\n5. Quantitative Results\nIn this section we share our sign language recognition\nand translation experimental setups and report quantitative\nresults. We ﬁrst go over the implementation details and\nintroduce the evaluation metrics we will be using to mea-\nsure the performance of our models. We start our exper-\niments by applying transformer networks to the text-to-\ntext based SLT tasks, namely Gloss2Text, Sign2Gloss2Text,\nSign2Gloss→Gloss2Text and report improved performance\nover using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based models.\nWe share our Sign2Gloss experiments, in which we explore\nthe effects of different types of spatial embeddings and net-\nwork structures on the performance of CSLR. We then train\nSign2Textand Sign2(Gloss+Text)models using the best per-\nforming Sign2Gloss conﬁguration and investigate the effect\nof different recognition loss weights on the joint recogni-\ntion and translation performance. Finally, we compare our\nbest performing models against other approaches and report\nstate-of-the-art results.\n5.1. Implementation and Evaluation Details\nFramework: We used a modiﬁed version of JoeyNMT\n[43] to implement our Sign Language Transformers 3. All\ncomponents of our network were built using the PyTorch\nframework [50], except the CTC beam search decoding, for\nwhich we utilized the TensorFlow implementation [1].\nNetwork Details: Our transformers are built using 512\nhidden units and 8 heads in each layer. We use Xavier ini-\ntialization [28] and train all of our networks from scratch.\nWe also utilize dropout with 0.1 drop rate on transformer\nlayers and word embeddings to mitigate over-ﬁtting.\nPerformance Metrics:We use Word Error Rate (WER)\nfor assessing our recognition models, as it is the prevalent\nmetric for evaluating CSLR performance [40]. To measure\nthe translation performance of our networks, we utilized\nBLEU [49] score (n-grams ranging from 1 to 4), which is\nthe most common metric for machine translation.\nTraining: We used the Adam [37] optimizer to train our\nnetworks using a batch size of 32 with a learning rate of\n10−3 (β1=0.9, β2=0.998) and a weight decay of 10−3. We\nutilize plateau learning rate scheduling which tracks the de-\nvelopment set performance. We evaluate our network every\n100 iterations. If the development score does not decrease\nfor 8 evaluation steps, we decrease the learning rate by a\nfactor of 0.7. This continues until the learning rate drops\nbelow 10−6.\nDecoding: During the training and validation steps we\nemploy a greedy search to decode both gloss sequences and\nspoken language sentences. At inference time, we utilize\nbeam search decoding with widths ranging from0 to 10. We\nalso implement a length penalty [74] with αvalues ranging\nfrom 0 to 2. We ﬁnd the best performing combination of\nbeam width and α on the development set and use these\nvalues for the test set evaluation.\n5.2. Text-to-Text Sign Language Translation\nIn our ﬁrst set of experiments, we adapt the trans-\nformer backbone of our technique, for text-to-text sign lan-\nguage translation. We then evaluate the performance gain\nachieved over the RNN-based attention architectures.\nAs can be seen in Table 1, utilizing transformers for\ntext-to-text sign language translation improved the perfor-\nmance across all tasks, reaching an impressive 25.35/24.54\nBLEU-4 score on the development and test sets. We believe\nthis performance gain is due to the more sophisticated at-\ntention architectures, namely self-attention modules, which\nlearn the contextual information within both source and tar-\nget sequences.\n3https://github.com/neccam/slt\nDEV TEST\nText-to-Text Tasks (RNNs vs Transformers)WER BLEU-1 BLEU-2 BLEU-3 BLEU-4WER BLEU-1 BLEU-2 BLEU-3 BLEU-4\nGloss2Text [9] - 44.40 31.83 24.61 20.16 - 44.13 31.47 23.89 19.26\nOur Gloss2Text- 50.69 38.16 30.53 25.35 - 48.90 36.88 29.45 24.54\nSign2Gloss2Text [9]- 42.88 30.30 23.02 18.40 - 43.29 30.39 22.82 18.13\nOur Sign2Gloss2Text- 47.73 34.82 27.11 22.11 - 48.47 35.35 27.57 22.45\nSign2Gloss→Gloss2Text [9] - 41.08 29.10 22.16 17.86 - 41.54 29.52 22.24 17.79\nOur Sign2Gloss→Gloss2Text - 47.84 34.65 26.88 21.84 - 47.74 34.37 26.55 21.59\nVideo-to-Text TasksWER BLEU-1 BLEU-2 BLEU-3 BLEU-4WER BLEU-1 BLEU-2 BLEU-3 BLEU-4\nCNN+LSTM+HMM [39]24.50 - - - - 26.50 - - - -\nOur Sign2Gloss24.88 - - - - 24.59 - - - -\nSign2Text [9] - 31.87 19.11 13.16 9.94 - 32.24 19.03 12.83 9.58\nOur Sign2Text- 45.54 32.60 25.30 20.69 - 45.34 32.31 24.83 20.17\nOur Best Recog.

Sign2Gloss\nTo tackle the Sign2Gloss task, we utilize our SLRT net-\nworks. Any CNN architecture can be used as spatial em-\nbedding layers to learn the sign language video frame rep-\nresentation while training SLRT in an end-to-end manner.\nHowever, due to hardware limitations (graphics card mem-\nory) we utilize pretrained CNNs as our spatial embeddings.\nWe extract frame level representations from sign videos and\ntrain our sign language transformers to learn CSLR and SLT\njointly in an end-to-end manner.\nIn our ﬁrst set of experiments, we investigate which CNN\nwe should be using to represent our sign videos. We utilize\nstate-of-the-art EfﬁcientNets [66], namely B0, B4 and B7,\nwhich were trained on ImageNet [20]. We also use an In-\nception [64] network which was pretrained for learning sign\nlanguage recognition in a CNN+LSTM+HMM setup [39].\nIn this set of experiments we employed a two layered trans-\nformer encoder model.\nTable 2 shows that as the spatial embedding layer be-\ncomes more advanced, i.e. B0 vs B7, the recognition per-\nformance increases. However, our networks beneﬁted more\nwhen we used pretrained features, as these networks had\nseen sign videos before and learned kernels which can em-\nbed more meaningful representations in the latent space.\nWe then tried utilizing Batch Normalization [33] followed\nby a ReLU [47] to normalize our inputs and allow our\nnetworks to learn more abstract non-linear representations.\nThis improved our results drastically, giving us a boost of\nnearly 7% and 6% of absolute WER reduction on the devel-\nopment and test sets, respectively.

Although having a larger\nnumber of layers would allow our networks to learn more\nabstract representations, it also makes them prone to over-\nﬁtting. To this end, we built our SLRT networks using one\nto six layers and evaluate their CSLR performance.\nOur recognition performance initially improves with ad-\nditional layers (See Table 3). However, as we continue\nadding more layers, our networks started to over-ﬁt on the\ntraining data, causing performance degradation. In the light\nof this, for the rest of our experiments, we constructed our\nsign language transformers using three layers.\n5.4. Sign2Text and Sign2(Gloss+Text)\nIn our next set of experiments we examine the per-\nformance gain achieved by unifying the recognition and\ntranslation tasks into a single model. As a baseline, we\ntrained a Sign2Text network by setting our recognition loss\nweight λR to zero. We then jointly train our sign language\ntransformers, for recognition and translation, with various\nweightings between the losses.\nAs can be seen in Table 4, jointly learning recogni-\ntion and translation with equal weighting (λR=λT=1.0) im-\nproves the translation performance, while degrading the\nrecognition performance compared to task speciﬁc net-\nworks. We believe this is due to scale differences of the\nCTC and word-level cross entropy losses. Increasing the\nrecognition loss weight improved both the recognition and\nDEV TEST\n# Layers del/ins WER del/ins WER\n1 11.72 / 9.02 28.08 11.20 / 10.57 29.90\n2 13.54 / 5.74 26.70 13.85 / 6.43 27.62\n3 11.68 / 6.48 24.88 11.16 / 6.09 24.59\n4 12.55 / 5.87 24.97 13.48 / 6.02 26.87\n5 11.94 / 6.12 25.23 11.81 / 6.12 25.51\n6 15.01 / 6.11 27.46 14.30 / 6.28 27.78\nTable 3: Impact of different numbers of layers\nLoss Weights DEV TEST\nλR λT WER BLEU-4 WER BLEU-4\n1.0 0.0 24.88 - 24.59 -\n0.0 1.0 - 20.69 - 20.17\n1.0 1.0 35.13 21.73 33.75 21.22\n2.5 1.0 26.99 22.11 27.55 21.37\n5.0 1.0 24.61 22.12 24.49 21.80\n10.0 1.0 24.98 22.38 26.16 21.32\n20.0 1.0 25.87 20.90 25.73 20.93\nTable 4: Training Sign Language Transformers to jointly\nlearn recognition and translation with different weight on\nrecognition loss.\nthe translation performance, demonstrating the value of\nsharing training between these related tasks.\nCompared to previously published methods, our Sign\nLanguage Transformers surpass both their recognition and\ntranslation performance (See Table 1). We report a decrease\nof 2% WER over [39] on the test set in both Sign2Gloss\nand Sign2(Gloss+Text)setups. More impressively, both our\nSign2Textand Sign2(Gloss+Text)networks doubled the pre-\nvious state-of-the-art translation results (9.58 vs. 20.17 and\n21.32 BLEU-4, respectively). Furthermore, our best per-\nforming translation Sign2(Gloss+Text) outperforms Cam-\ngoz et al .’s text-to-text based Gloss2Text translation per-\nformance (19.26 vs 21.32 BLEU-4), which was previously\nproposed as a pseudo upper bound on performance in [9].\nThis supports our claim that given more sophisticated net-\nwork architectures, one would and should achieve better\nperformance translating directly from video representations\nrather than doing text-to-text translation through a limited\ngloss representation.\n6. Qualitative Results\nIn this section we report our qualitative results. We\nshare the spoken language translations generated by our\nbest performing Sign2(Gloss+Text) model given sign video\nrepresentations (See Table 5) 4. As the annotations in the\nPHOENIX14T dataset are in German, we share both the\nproduced sentences and their translations in English.\nOverall, the quality of the translations is good, and even\nwhere the exact wording differs, it conveys the same infor-\nmation. The most difﬁcult translations seem to be named\nentities like locations which occur in limited contexts in the\ntraining data. Speciﬁc numbers are also challenging as there\nis no grammatical context to distinguish one from another.\nDespite this, the sentences produced follow standard gram-\nmar with surprisingly few exceptions.\n7. Conclusion and Future Work\nSign language recognition and understanding is an es-\nsential part of the sign language translation task. Previous\ntranslation approaches relied heavily on recognition as the\ninitial step of their system. In this paper we proposed Sign\nLanguage Transformers, a novel transformer based archi-\ntecture to jointly learn sign language recognition and trans-\n4Visit our code repository for further qualitative examples.\nReference: im sden schwacher wind .( in the south gentle wind . )Ours: der wind weht im sden schwach .( the wind blows gentle in the south . )Reference: hnliches wetter dann auch am donnerstag .( similar weather then also on thursday . )Ours: hnliches wetter auch am donnerstag .( similar weather also on thursday . )Reference: ganz hnliche temperaturen wie heute zwischen sechs und elf grad .( quite similar temperatures as today between six and eleven degrees . )Ours: hnlich wie heute nacht das sechs bis elf grad .( similar as today at night that six to eleven degrees . )Reference: heute nacht neunzehn bis fnfzehn grad im sdosten bis zwlf grad .( tonight nineteen till ﬁfteen degrees in the southeast till twelve degrees . )Ours: heute nacht werte zwischen neun und fnfzehn grad im sdosten bis zwlf grad .( tonight values between nine and ﬁfteen degrees in the southeast till twelve degrees . )Reference: am sonntag im norden und in der mitte schauer dabei ist es im norden strmisch .( on sunday in the north and center shower while it is stormy in the north . )Ours: am sonntag im norden und in der mitte niederschlge im norden ist es weiter strmisch .( on sunday in the north and center rainfall in the north it is continuously stormy . )Reference: im sden und sdwesten gebietsweise regen sonst recht freundlich .( in the south and southwest partly rain otherwise quite friendly . )Ours: im sdwesten regnet es zum teil krftig .( in the southwest partly heavy rain . )Reference: in der nacht sinken die temperaturen auf vierzehn bis sieben grad .( at night the temperatures lower till fourteen to seven degrees . )Ours: heute nacht werte zwischen sieben und sieben grad .( tonight values between seven and seven degrees . )Reference: heute nacht ist es meist stark bewlkt rtlich regnet oder nieselt es etwas .( tonight it is mostly cloudy locally rain or drizzle . )Ours: heute nacht ist es verbreitet wolkenverhangen gebietsweise regnet es krftig .(tonight it is widespread covered with clouds partly strong rain . )Reference: an der saar heute nacht milde sechzehn an der elbe teilweise nur acht grad .( at the saar river tonight mild sixteen at the elbe river partly only eight degrees . )Ours: im rhein und sdwesten macht sich morgen nur knapp ber null grad .( in the rhine river and south west becomes just above zero degrees . )\nTable 5: Generated spoken language translations by our\nSign Language Transformers.\nlation in an end-to-end manner. We utilized CTC loss to\ninject gloss level supervision into the transformer encoder,\ntraining it to do sign language recognition while learning\nmeaningful representations for the end goal of sign lan-\nguage translation, without having an explicit gloss repre-\nsentation as an information bottleneck.\nWe evaluated our approach on the challenging\nPHOENIX14T dataset and report state-of-the-art sign\nlanguage recognition and translation results, in some\ncases doubling the performance of previous translation\napproaches. Our ﬁrst set of experiments have shown\nthat using features which were pretrained on sign data\noutperformed using generic ImageNet based spatial rep-\nresentations. Furthermore, we have shown that jointly\nlearning recognition and translation improved the per-\nformance across both tasks. More importantly, we have\nsurpassed the text-to-text translation results, which was set\nas a virtual upper-bound, by directly translating spoken\nlanguage sentences from video representations.\nAs future work, we would like to expand our approach to\nmodel multiple sign articulators, namely faces, hands and\nbody, individually to encourage our networks to learn the\nlinguistic relationship between them.\n8.
