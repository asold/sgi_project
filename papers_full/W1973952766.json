Recent evidence\nshows that the weights in averaging different sources of\ninformation match their relative inverse variances [2–3]. Such\nweighted averages are optimal in that they minimize the variance\nof the combined estimate, and they are appropriate when the\ninformation refers to a certain characteristic of one and the same\nobject.\nIn tool-use actions, such as controlling a cursor on a monitor\nthrough a computer mouse, however, visual information specifies\nthe position of the effective part of the tool (i.e., cursor), while\nproprioceptive information specifies the position of the hand.\nThese two positions of different objects have a clear spatial\nseparation. They are related to each other only through the tool’s\nkinematic transformation. Even though the positions of the hand\nand the cursor remain distinct perceptually, they might be biased\ntoward each other. This kind of interaction between sensory\nsignals, which does not result in a fused percept but in distinct\nperceptions with mutual biases, has been referred to as coupling\n[4]. Coupling can also be conceived in terms of weighted averages\nof the different sensory signals (see Appendix – Text S1). It can\nserve to reduce the variances of the biased estimates, and thus, to\nenhance the precision even when visual and proprioceptive\ninformation refer to different objects. This is illustrated in\nFigure 1. Note that even the smaller variance of the visually\nbased perceptions can be reduced by sensory coupling.\nThe coupling of visual and proprioceptive spatial information in\ntool-use actions is not well understood. Thus, this study\ninvestigated sensory coupling and the resulting perceptual biases\nin tool use. Proprioceptive biases toward vision have been\nobserved previously (i.e., visual capture [5]), whereas visual biases\ntoward proprioception might be of little importance in tool-use\nactions, as attention tends to be focused on the visual information\n[6–7] and conscious awareness of the position of the hand becomes\nseverely limited [8]. Indeed, there is both behavioral [9] and\nelectrophysiological [10] evidence of functional neglect and\nsuppression of proprioceptive input to the somatosensory cortex\nduring tool-use actions. The absence or functional impairment of\nproprioceptive information can be even beneficial for tool-use\nperformance [11–12]. Based on these considerations, we tested the\nhypothesis that the proprioceptively sensed direction of the hand is\nstrongly biased toward the visually sensed direction of the cursor in\ntool use (as visual capture [5]), whereas the latter is only slightly\nbiased toward the former.\nCoupling of the proprioceptive information on hand direction\nand the visual information on cursor direction together with the\nresulting perceptual biases should be associated with costs in terms\nof one’s overall learning capability of the tool’s kinematic\ntransformation. In particular, it should reduce the explicitly\nknown differences between hand positions, that constitute the\ninput to the transformation, and cursor positions, that constitute\nthe output. Thereby it should compromise the explicit learning of\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68471\nthe relation between hand and cursor positions, which is an\nelement of learning of kinematic transformations [13].\nLearning of a tool’s transformation, however, also involves an\nimplicit process that is outside conscious awareness [14–15]. This\nprocess requires hand-position information as well, although its\nsources might differ from the sources of conscious awareness of\nhand position. For example, motor outflow or the associated\ncorollary discharge [16] or efference copy [17] might be involved\nto a greater extent. Accordingly, it should be possible to identify a\nsecond, implicit rather than explicit, representation of the\ndirection of the hand. For this purpose, we devised a task that\nenables an indirect (or implicit) measure of the sensed hand\ndirection [18]. This measure exploits error propagation in\nsuccessive aiming movements [19–21], in particular the propaga-\ntion of errors that originate from visually induced discrepancies\nbetween the physical and the perceived position of the hand [22–\n24].\nIn the present study, the relation between the explicit and\nimplicit measures of hand direction was explored in three different\nways. First, we determined the inter-individual covariation of both\nmeasures, which should be close to zero if they indeed tap distinct\nrepresentations. Second, we tested age-related variations for the\ntwo measures, which could be different. Assume that the explicit\nmeasure taps a representation being used for explicit learning of\nkinematic transformations and that the implicit measure taps a\nrepresentation being used for implicit learning. Further assume\nthat learning suffers when perceptual biases become stronger, so\nthat the directions of hand and cursor become harder to\ndiscriminate. Then, the observation of age-related deficits of\nexplicit learning [13,25] leads one to expect stronger perceptual\nbiases in older than in younger adults for the explicit measures, in\nparticular for the stronger bias of the explicit measure of the sensed\ndirection of the hand toward the direction of the cursor. In\ncontrast, there should be no age-related variation for the implicit\nmeasure because there is no age-related deficit of implicit learning\n[13,25]. Third, we tested sequential effects of trials for explicit and\nimplicit measures which could be different as well. In the present\nstudy, one of the two types (cursor and hand) of explicit judgment\nwas randomly instructed to the participants for each trial, thus\npossibly enabling for participants to relate to trial history regarding\nthe type of judgment. Hence, it could affect information processing\nin the subsequent trials.\nThe results will show mutual biases with a strong asymmetry,\nnamely, a visual dominance over proprioception. Importantly,\nimplicit and explicit judgments of hand direction exhibited a\nnumber of differences, among them different age-related changes,\nthat strongly suggest that they tap different neural representations.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nTwenty young adults (mean6SD: 26.163.2 years; range: 20–\n30 years; 9 males and 11 females) and twenty older adults\n(59.665.7 years; range: 50–69 years; 10 males and 10 females)\nparticipated in the study. All participants were right-handed, had\nno history of stroke, arthritis, or other neurological or movement\nimpairments, and gave written informed consent prior to\nparticipation. The study was conducted in accordance with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki and with general approval by the ethics\ncommittee of the Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environ-\nment and Human Factors.\nYoung and older participants were compared on two subtests of\nthe German version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [26]:\nthe Digit Symbol Test, a test of perceptuo-motor processing speed,\nand the Vocabulary Test, a test of culturally mediated knowledge.\nConsistent with typical findings, the average score on the Digit\nSymbol Test was significantly higher for the young adults\n(mean6SD: 66.7612.1) than for the older adults (50.9613.6,\nt(38) = 3.8,P,0.001), whereas the average score of the Vocabulary\nTest tended to be lower for the young adults (25.863.9) than for\nthe older adults (30.6611.3, t(38) = 1.7,P = 0.088). According to\nthese findings, the two groups were representative for their\nrespective age groups in terms of general age-related variations\nand invariances.\nApparatus\nThe experimental setup (Fig. 2a) was quite similar to the one\nused in our previous study [18]. Participants were seated at a table,\non which a digitizer tablet (133 Hz sampling rate) and a monitor\nwere placed. The monitor was covered by a large black circular\nscreen with a semi-circular window (32 cm in diameter) in its\ncenter. The participants held a stylus with their right hand and\nmade movements on the digitizer. An opaque board placed above\nthe participants’ arm blocked their direct view of the hand\nmovements.\nDesign and procedure\nParticipants performed three-stroke arm movements as de-\nscribed previously [18]. The first target (T1, 1.4 cm in diameter)\nwas located in the center of the semi-circular window (Fig. 2b).\nThe start position (SP, 1.2 cm in diameter) was located 3 cm\nbelow T1. A second target (T2, 1 cm in diameter) was presented at\npseudo random locations, ranging from260u to +60u relative to\nthe central location, on an invisible circle with a radius of 15 cm\naround T1. The participants made three-stroke movements from\nthe SP to T1 (1st stroke), then to T2 (2nd stroke), and subsequently\nback to T1 (3rd stroke). To stop the movements mechanically at\nthe end of the 2nd strokes, a semi-circular plastic ring (stopper ring)\nwith a radius of 15 cm around T1 and 3 mm height was placed on\nthe digitizer’s surface.\nAt the beginning of each trial, participants were guided to the\nSP by arrows shown on the monitor [18]. One second after the\nstylus was in the SP, T2 was displayed for 1 s (Fig. 2b, 1st panel).\nSubsequently, T1 was displayed. After a delay of 0.5 s, an auditory\ngo-signal was delivered. The participants then made three-stroke\nmovements at a comfortable speed. Once the participants made\nthe 1st stroke to T1, this target disappeared. The 1st stroke was\nintroduced because the participants would naturally look at T1\n[27–28], which prevented them from keeping their gaze on T2 to\nremember its location. Subsequently, the participants made the\n2nd stroke to the remembered T2 until the movement was stopped\nby the stopper ring, and then made a return movement (3rd stroke)\nback to the remembered T1 location.\nThe feedback cursor was displayed concurrently with the hand\nmovements only during the 1st and the 2nd strokes. Only during\nthe 2nd strokes, the motions of the cursor were rotated relative to\nthe directions of the hand movements. Participants had to adjust\ntheir movements so that the cursor on the monitor would move\ntoward the remembered T2 location (Fig. 2b, 3rd panel). The\nremembered T2 was introduced instead of a visible T2, so that the\nparticipants focused on the visual feedback cursor rather than on\nthe visual target during the 2nd stroke. There were twelve different\nrotation angles (clockwise [CW] direction: 230u, 225u, 220u,\n215u, 210u, 25u; counter-clockwise [CCW] direction: 5u,1 0u,\n15u,2 0u,2 5u,3 0u), which were randomized across trials.\nThe participants made the 3rd stroke without visual feedback.\nOne second after completing the 3rd stroke, the participants were\nasked to judge either the hand or cursor direction at the end of the\nMultiple Representations of Hand Position\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68471\n2nd stroke (Fig. 2b, 4 th panels). For the judgment of cursor\ndirection (explicit cursor judgment, 4th panel top), a short white\nline (width: 0.15 cm; length: 2 cm) was displayed. It marked the\nperipheral end of a radial line from T1 to the circumference of the\ninvisible ring of 15 cm diameter centered at T1. The radial line,\nand thus its visible peripheral end, moved at a constant speed\ncounter-clockwise or clockwise, beginning at a start position 102u\nto the right or left of the vertical. The participants instructed the\nexaminer to stop and finely adjust the line to the direction that\nmatched the direction of the cursor at the end of the 2\nnd stroke.\nFor the judgment of hand direction (explicit hand judgment, 4th\npanel bottom), the participants moved the pen from the right (or\nleft) lower corner of the stopper ring counter-clockwise (or\nclockwise) along the ring and stopped where he/she thought the\nhand direction matched the direction of the hand at the end of the\n2\nnd stroke. This hand movement along the circular path served to\nindicate the hand position at the end of the 2nd stroke instead of\nreproducing the movement from motor memory. For the explicit\njudgments, type of judgment (hand or cursor direction) and\ndirection of line or hand movement during the judgment\n(clockwise or counter-clockwise) were randomized across trials.\nData were recorded in six trials for each of the 12 angular\nrotations of visual feedback during the 2\nnd stroke, totaling 72 trials\nfor each type of explicit judgment, cursor and hand. The\nexperiment consisted of a block of 5 familiarization trials, a block\nof 8 practice trials, and a block of experimental trials (144\nexperimental trials were preceded by a warm-up trial). The\nfamiliarization trials included the procedure without the visual-\nfeedback rotation and without the judgment part. The practice\ntrials included all the procedure. A couple of breaks of a few\nminutes each were inserted as needed during the block of\nexperimental trials.\nData Analysis\nExplicit judgments of cursor and hand direction. The\nangular deviation of the judged hand (or cursor) direction from the\nactual hand (or cursor) direction at the end of the 2\nnd stroke was\nmeasured in each trial. A positive (or negative) angular deviation\nindicated a CCW (or CW) deviation of the judged direction from\nthe actual direction.\nMeans and standard deviations of the angular deviations were\ncomputed for each type of judgment (cursor or hand) and each\nvisual-feedback rotation in each participant. To measure the\ninfluence of the rotated visual feedback on the explicit judgments,\na linear regression was performed for each participant and each\ntype of judgment; angular deviation was set as the dependent\nvariable and visual-feedback rotation as the independent variable.\nThe resulting slope parameters are estimates of the proportional\nbiases of the explicit judgments. They specify the strength of the\ncoupling in terms of the biases of both types of judgment in\ndegrees per degree of the visual-feedback rotation. We shall refer\nto them as explicit-judgment biases. The intercepts of the\nregression lines served to assess overall offsets of the judgments\nin the CCW or CW direction independent of the visual-feedback\nrotation.\nThe data were screened for outliers both among trials and\namong participants. Based on the linear regressions, trials with\njudgments outside the range of predicted judgments63SD of the\nresiduals were eliminated as outliers. As a result, 28 trials (0.49 %)\nout of 5,760 trials were removed from all analyses. Subsequently,\nthe bias parameters for each type of judgment and each\nparticipant were screened for outliers. Means and standard\ndeviations across all participants of both age groups were\ncalculated for the two types of judgment, and bias parameters\noutside the range of mean63SD were defined as outliers. These\ncomputations were repeated until no further outliers were found.\nAs the result, two young adults and one older adult were identified\nas having outliers for the cursor judgments, and another young\nadult for the hand judgments. These participants were excluded\nfrom all analyses.\nIndirect measure of the sensed direction of the\nhand. The indirect (implicit) measure of the sensed direction\nof the hand was computed as described previously [18]. The\nfollowing three steps were taken. First, the angle (a in Fig. 2c)\nbetween the line connecting T1 with the end of the 2\nnd stroke\n(Line A) and the line connecting the end of the 2nd stroke with the\nend of the 3rd stroke (Line B) was measured. Second, Line B was\nFigure 1. Variance reduction through sensory coupling.Relative variances of biased proprioceptively (a: var(P’)/var(P)) and visually (b: var(V’)/\nvar(V)) sensed spatial characteristics, such as directions, are plotted against the proportional bias toward the other modality, vision and\nproprioception, respectively. Var(P’) and var(V’) are the variances of the biased directions, whereas var(P) and var(V) are the variances of the unbiased\ndirections based only on proprioception and vision, respectively. The relative variances are plotted as a function of bias for different ratios of var(V)/\nvar(P) (0.2 to 0.7). Equations are given in Appendix (Text S1). Note that sensory coupling serves to reduce variability (a, b) to a minimum at an\nintermediate bias, and a weak coupling (small bias) does so even for the more precise visually sensed spatial characteristic (b).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068471.g001\nMultiple Representations of Hand Position\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68471\nshifted in parallel to the axes of the coordinate system until its end\n(i.e., the end of the 3rd-stroke, white open circle in Fig. 2c) was in\nT1. Third, the location of the other end of the shifted line (Line B’)\nserved as an estimate of the felt hand position at the end of the 2\nnd-\nstroke (dotted white circle in Fig. 2c). We used the angle a’\nbetween the Line A and the Line B’ as estimate of the rotation of\nthe felt hand position relative to the actual hand position, that is, as\nimplicit angular deviation. When Line B’ (i.e., 3rd stroke) was\nrotated to the CCW or CW direction compared to Line A (i.e., 2nd\nstroke), the implicit angular deviation ( a’) had a positive or\nnegative sign, respectively.\nThe implicit judgment was made in each trial before the type of\nexplicit judgment was instructed to the participants. Therefore,\nmeans and standard deviations of the implicit angular deviations\nwere computed across both types of explicit judgment for each\nvisual-feedback rotation and each participant. To measure the\ninfluence of the rotated visual feedback on the indirect measure of\nthe sensed hand direction, the implicit angular deviations (a’) of\neach participant were subjected to a linear regression with rotation\nof visual feedback as the independent variable. The resulting slope\nparameter is an estimate of the bias of the indirect measure of the\nsensed hand direction per degree of the rotation of visual feedback.\nWe shall refer to it as implicit-judgment bias. The intercept of the\nregression line is an estimate of the overall offset of the implicit\njudgments in the CCW or CW direction independent of the visual-\nfeedback rotation.\nTrials were screened for those with outlying implicit measures\nby using the same principles as described above for the explicit\njudgments. Based on the linear regressions, 19 trials (0.33%) out of\n5,760 trials were removed from all analyses. Next, the individual\nbias parameters were screened for outliers; another young adult\nwas excluded from all analyses, leaving 16 young adults and 19\nolder adults for the subsequent analyses.\nStatistical analyses. Individual means, standard deviations,\nand regression coefficients as well as intercepts were subjected to\nstatistical analyses. These were mainly ANOVAs with the\nbetween-participant factor age group (young vs older) and\ndifferent within-participant factors, such as rotation of visual\nfeedback or type of judgment. The specific within-participant\nfactor(s) used are stated in the Results section. When appropriate,\npost-hoc comparisons were performed using t-tests with Bonfer-\nroni correction (a = 0.05). Additionally, the individually computed\nslopes and intercepts of the linear regressions were subjected to\none-sample t-tests against zero. To examine whether the implicit-\njudgment bias of hand direction was related to the explicit-\nFigure 2. Behavioral task of a 3-stroke movement and analysis.\n(a) The experimental setup.

Explicit-\njudgment biases of hand and cursor direction and implicit-\njudgment bias of hand direction were computed for each\nparticipant and each subset of trials.\nResults\nExplicit judgments of cursor and hand directions\nThe mean angular deviations of the judged cursor directions\nfrom the corresponding physical directions showed a slightly\nnegative slope as a function of the visual-feedback rotation (Fig. 3,\ncircles). This indicates a slight bias of the cursor judgments toward\nthe direction of the hand. Conversely, the mean angular deviations\nof the judged hand directions from the physical directions showed\na steep positive slope as a function of the feedback rotation (Fig. 3,\nsquares). This indicates a strong bias of the hand judgments\ntoward the direction of the cursor. The older adults had a greater\nslope than the young adults, hence their bias was stronger.\nBias parameters were computed individually as slopes of the\nindividual regressions of angular deviations on visual-feedback\nrotations. The mean (6SE) biases of explicit cursor judgments\nwere slightly negative for both the young (20.0860.02) and older\n(20.0760.01) groups. One-sample t-tests revealed that the means\nwere significantly below 0 for both groups (young:t(15) =24.4,\np,0.001; older: t(18) =25.7, p,0.001). Conversely, the mean\n(6SE) biases of explicit hand judgments were strongly positive\n(young: 0.6360.04; older: 0.7560.03). A 2 (group: young vs older)\nx 2 (type of judgment: cursor vs hand) ANOVA showed that the\nmain effects of group (F(1,33) = 5.5,P,0.05) and type of judgment\n(F(1,33) = 910.7,P,0.001) were significant, and so was the group\nby type-of-judgment interaction ( F(1,33) = 4.4,P,0.05). The\ninteraction effect was due to a significantly stronger bias of the\nexplicit hand judgments for the older adults compared to the\nyoung ones (P,0.05), while there was no group difference for the\nbias of the explicit cursor judgments (P.0.05).\nImplicit and explicit judgments of hand direction\nSimilar to the explicit judgments, mean angular deviations of\nthe implicit hand judgments had a positive slope as a function of\nthe visual-feedback rotation (Fig. 3, triangles), indicating a bias\nFigure 4. Correlations between explicit- and implicit-judgment biases.Scatter plots of the relations between the individual implicit-\njudgment biases of hand direction and the individual explicit-judgment biases of hand direction (a, c) and cursor direction (b, d) in the young (a, b)\nand older (c, d) group.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068471.g004\nMultiple Representations of Hand Position\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68471\ntoward the cursor direction. The mean (6SE) biases of implicit\nhand judgments were 0.3160.02 for the young and 0.3060.02 for\nthe older participants. These means were not different between the\ntwo age groups, and they were smaller than the explicit-judgment\nbiases. A 2 (group: young vs older)62 (type of judgment: hand-\nimplicit vs hand-explicit) ANOVA revealed a significant main\neffect of type of judgment ( F(1,33) = 219.3,P,0.001) and a\nsignificant interaction ( F(1,33) = 6.6,P,0.05). The interaction\neffect was due to the significantly stronger bias of the explicit hand\njudgments in the older group than in the young group, while there\nwas no group difference for the bias of the implicit hand judgments\n(P.0.05).\nThe presence of an age effect on the explicit-judgment bias, but\nnot on the implicit-judgment bias, supports the hypothesis that the\ndifferent measures tap different representations of arm direction\nand are not derived from a single representation. As a further test\nof this hypothesis, we computed the correlations between the two\ntypes of bias in the two age groups (Fig. 4a, c). Neither for the\nyoung (Fig. 4a, r = 0.381,P.0.05) nor for the older participants\n(Fig. 4c, r = 0.009, P.0.05) was the correlation statistically\nsignificant. In addition, we also tested whether the implicit-\njudgment bias of hand direction was related to the explicit-\njudgment bias of cursor direction (Fig. 4b, d). In both age groups,\nthe correlations were not significant (young: r = 0.133,P.0.05,\nFig. 4b; older:r = 0.288,P.0.05, Fig. 4d), showing that these two\ntypes of biases were also not related to each other.\nOffsets of implicit and explicit judgments\nThe mean angular deviation of explicit hand judgments was a\nfew degrees above zero at the 0u rotation of visual feedback for\nboth age groups (Fig. 3, squares). This indicates that participants\ngenerally judged the direction of the hand to be slightly rotated in\nthe counter-clockwise direction compared to the physical direc-\ntion. In contrast, the mean angular deviations of explicit cursor\njudgments (Fig. 3, circles) and of implicit hand judgments (Fig. 3,\ntriangles) were around zero for both age groups, indicating that\nthere was no such offset of judged directions relative to physical\nones. One-sample t-tests were applied to the intercepts of the\nindividual regressions of angular deviations on visual-feedback\nrotations. The mean intercept of the explicit hand judgments was\nsignificantly greater than zero (t(34) = 3.4, p,0.001), whereas the\nmean intercepts of the other two types of judgment did not differ\nfrom zero (P.0.05).\nIntra-individual variability of judgments\nThe asymmetric biases of visually and proprioceptively sensed\ndirections are likely to be related to their respective precisions [29–\n30]. Therefore, we measured the variability of explicit and implicit\njudgments. The mean intra-individual standard deviations were\nsmall and similar for the explicit cursor judgments (Fig. 5, circles)\nand the implicit hand judgments (Fig. 5, triangles), but much\nlarger for the explicit hand judgments (Fig. 5, squares). Only for\nthe latter type of judgment, the young participants had a greater\nintra-individual variability than the older participants.\nThe individual standard deviations were subjected to a 2 (group:\nyoung vs older) 63 (type of judgment: cursor-explicit, hand-\nexplicit, and hand-implicit) 612 (visual-feedback rotation) AN-\nOVA. The interaction of group and type of judgment was\nsignificant (F(2,66) = 9.1,P,0.001), and so were the main effects of\ngroup ( F(1,33) = 7.5, P,0.001) and type of judgment\n(F(2,66) = 71.2,P,0.001). The explicit hand judgments showed\nsignificantly greater variability than the other two types of\njudgment (post-hoc, P,0.001), which were not significantly\ndifferent from each other (P.0.05). Furthermore, the observed\ninteraction effect was due to a significant group difference for the\nexplicit hand judgments (P,0.001), but not for the other two types\nof judgment (P.0.05). There was no significant effect of visual-\nfeedback rotation.\nSequential effects of the type of explicit judgment\nThe type of explicit judgment was instructed to the participants\nonly after the three-stroke movement had been finished in the\npresent experiment. Thus, this instruction should not affect the\nprocessing of the visual and proprioceptive information on cursor\ndirection and hand direction in the current trial. However, in\nprinciple it could affect information processing in the subsequent\ntrial. Therefore, we examined the sequential effects of the type of\nexplicit judgment on the biases both of explicit and implicit\njudgments.\nThe bias of the explicit hand judgments was somewhat stronger\n(greater positive values) after explicit hand judgments (Fig. 6c, d,\nfilled circles) than after explicit cursor judgments (open circles).\nSimilarly, the bias of the explicit cursor judgments was generally\nstronger (smaller negative values) after explicit cursor judgments\n(Fig. 6a, b, open circles) than after explicit hand judgments (filled\ncircles). These results indicate that the biases of explicit judgments\nbecame stronger when the same type of explicit judgment was\nrequired in preceding trials. In terms of coupling, this implies that\nthe weight of that sensory information was increased that was not\nrelevant for the preceding explicit judgments. Such effects were\nconsistently found in the older adults regardless of the number of\njudgment repetitions (Fig. 6b, d), but observed only after repeated\njudgments in the young adults (Fig. 6a, c).\nThe means of the individually determined biases of explicit\njudgments were subjected to a 2 (group: young vs older)62 (type\nof judgment: cursor vs hand) 62 (preceding type of explicit\njudgment: cursor vs hand) 62 (repetition: once vs repeated)\nANOVA. For this analysis, the sign of all bias values of the explicit\ncursor judgments (Fig. 6a, b) was changed to the opposite so that\nlarger values indicated stronger biases as was the case with the\nexplicit hand judgments (Fig. 6c, d). The two-way interaction of\ntype of judgment and preceding type of judgment was significant\nFigure 5. Intra-individual variability of judgments. Mean\nstandard deviations (SD) of the angular deviations of the judged\ndirections from the corresponding physical directions as a function of\nthe rotation of visual feedback. The values are plotted for explicit\njudgments of cursor direction (circles) and hand direction (squares) and\nimplicit judgments of hand direction (triangles) Open and filled symbols\nrefer to the young and older groups, respectively. The error bars\nrepresent the SE.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068471.g005\nMultiple Representations of Hand Position\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68471\n(F(1,33) = 7.9,P,0.01), confirming the above observation that\nbiases of explicit judgments became relatively stronger when the\nexplicit judgments were repeated. Additionally, there were\nsignificant main effects of group (F(1,33) = 5.2,P,0.05) and type\nof judgment ( F(1,33) = 450.2,P,0.001), as well as significant\ninteractions of type of judgment and group (F(1,33) = 5.3,P,0.05),\nrepetition and group (F(1,33) = 4.7,P,0.05), and of all four factors\n(F(1,33) = 5.0,P,0.05).\nThe mean bias of implicit hand judgments (Figure 6e, f) was\ngenerally weaker after explicit hand judgments (filled circles) than\nafter explicit cursor judgments (open circles) in both age groups.\nThis difference was much emphasized after repeated explicit\njudgments of hand direction. In terms of coupling, it implies a\nstronger weight of hand-position information after explicit\njudgments of hand position rather than a stronger weight of\ncursor-position information. These findings contrast sharply with\nthe sequential effects found for the explicit hand judgments. We\nperformed a 2 (group: young vs older)62 (type of judgment: hand-\nexplicit vs hand-implicit)62 (preceding type of explicit judgment:\ncursor vs hand) 62 (repetition: once vs repeated) ANOVA. A\nsignificant two-way interaction of type of judgment and preceding\ntype of judgment (F(1,33) = 7.7,P,0.01) and a significant three-\nway interaction of type of judgment, preceding type of judgment,\nand repetition ( F(1,33) = 6.6,P,0.05) confirmed the above\nobservations. Other significant main effects or interactions were\ntype of judgment ( F(1,33) = 238.7, P,0.001), repetition\n(F(1,33) = 6.1,P,0.05), type-of-judgment by group (F(1,33) = 7.3,\nP,0.05), and repetition by group (F(1,33) = 4.4,P,0.05).\nIn summary, biases of explicit judgments tended to become\nstronger when the same type of explicit judgment was required in\npreceding trials, in particular after more than one trial with that\ntype of judgment. In contrast, the bias of implicit hand judgments\nbecame weaker after explicit hand judgments in the preceding\ntrials. Moreover, the sequential effects of the type of explicit\njudgment in the preceding trials implicit-judgment biases in the\ncurrent trials were similar across the two age groups, but tended to\nbe different for the explicit-judgment biases.\nDiscussion\nAsymmetric biases of cursor judgments and hand\njudgments\nThe present results revealed strong mutual biases of perceived\nspatial characteristics of the cursor and the hand, being consistent\nwith previous studies [8,18,31]. Instead of full information\nintegration, the perceived directions of hand and cursor remained\ndifferent. The sum of the proportional biases of cursor and hand\njudgments was less than 1, but larger than 0. This indicates sensory\ncoupling, a sensory interaction, which is intermediate on the\ncontinuum between perfect integration or fusion and indepen-\ndence [32].\nThe biases showed visual dominance over proprioception.\nVisual dominance is likely related to the higher precision of visual\nthan of proprioceptive spatial information. For example, visual\ndominance can be turned into proprioceptive dominance under\nconditions where visual information has lower precision than\nproprioceptive information [29–30]. Consistent with a critical role\nof relative precision, we observed a higher variability of explicit\njudgments of hand direction compared to cursor direction. An\nalternative account of the visual dominance found in the present\nstudy could refer to the nature of the task, the control of a visually\nperceived cursor, which could go along with an attentional focus\non cursor direction rather than on hand direction. However,\nbimodal integration is likely not affected by modality-specific\nattention [33].\nThe present findings suggest the conclusion that, for coupling of\nthe two distinct types of spatial information in tool use, the central\nnervous system implements basically the same mechanism as in\nthe case of sensory integration without tool use. In fact, coupling in\ntool use can be conceptualized as a generalization of sensory\nintegration which results in biases rather than in fusion (see\nAppendix – Text S1). It likely produces more precise estimates of\ncursor and hand directions, but at the cost of systematic errors that\nresult in inaccurate information on the tool’s kinematic transfor-\nmation.\nThe bias of the hand-direction judgments towards the cursor\ndirection became stronger at older age, whereas the bias of the\ncursor-direction judgments towards the hand direction remained\nunchanged. The stronger bias at older age should reduce the\nsensitivity to sensory conflicts [18,31] and impair the learning of\nthe relation between hand positions and cursor positions.\nAging not only results in stronger biases overall but also\nenhances the asymmetry of the biases. This likely is a result of the\nincreased reliance on vision at older age [34–36]. A consequence\nof this age-related change could be the smaller variability of the\nexplicit hand judgments for the older than for the young adults.\nThis finding is puzzling at first because larger, rather than smaller,\nvariability of the judgments is expected in older adults for two\nreasons. First, older adults are known to have poorer propriocep-\ntive sensitivity [37]; even though it is not always the case [38],\nhigher sensitivity of older adults would be quite unusual. Second,\nand more generally, aging increases the neural noise of informa-\ntion processing [39–40]. However, the expectation of a larger\nvariability in older adults was not confirmed in this study. The\nsmaller variability found instead is likely a by-product of their\nstronger bias. As is illustrated in Fig. 1, the variability of coupled\nsensory signals declines as the coupling and thus the bias becomes\nstronger until a minimum is reached. In support of such critical\nrole of bias, the age-related decline of variability was found only\nfor the explicit hand judgments where the bias was increased, but\nnot for the explicit cursor judgments and the implicit hand\njudgments where the biases were invariant across the age range\nstudied.\nThe dissociation of explicit and implicit judgments of\nhand direction\nOur findings revealed a number of differences between the\nexplicit and implicit judgments of hand direction. First, explicit\njudgments had considerably larger variability than implicit\njudgments. Second, only the explicit judgments exhibited an offset\nin counter-clockwise direction. Third, the bias toward the\ndirection of the cursor for the explicit judgments was about twice\nas strong as for the implicit judgments. Fourth, the bias toward the\ncursor direction increased with age only for the explicit judgments.\nFifth, the variability declined with increasing age only for explicit\njudgments. Sixth, the individual biases of explicit and implicit\njudgments were uncorrelated. Seventh, biases of explicit and\nimplicit judgments exhibited opposite sequential effects.\nTaken together, these findings suggest the existence of two\ndifferent representations of hand direction, similar to different\nrepresentations of visual stimuli (e.g., [41–42]). At present, the\nfunctional distinction of an implicit and an explicit representation\nof hand direction cannot be mapped to particular regions of the\nbrain. However, different neural substrates, such as the posterior-\nparietal cortex [43–45], the primary motor cortex [46], and the\npremotor cortex [47] could be involved. Both the implicit and the\nexplicit measures of hand direction are affected by visual direction\nMultiple Representations of Hand Position\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68471\ninformation according to the present results. Consistent with this\nobservation, at least some of these neural substrates that are\ninvolved in processing hand direction combine proprioceptive and\nvisual information. Different representations of hand direction can\nalso be based on different combinations of the available sources of\ninformation. For example, the explicit representation could rely\nmore on signals of the different types of sense organs in the joints,\nligaments, and muscles, whereas the implicit representation could\nrely more on motor-outflow related information.\nThe observed differences between implicit and explicit judg-\nments of hand direction, however, do not necessarily result from\ndifferent representations. They can also originate from other\nfactors when a single representation of hand direction is accessed\nby different response systems and/or at different times. Such issues\nplay a central role in controversies around the notions of two visual\nFigure 6.

The\nmean biases are plotted separately depending on the type (cursor direction: open circles; hand direction: filled circles) of the explicit judgment\nperformed in the preceding trials and on its repetition (once or repeated). The error bars represent the SE.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068471.g006\nMultiple Representations of Hand Position\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68471\nsystems (e.g. [48–49]) or of implicit and explicit learning systems\n(e.g. [50]).\nFor example, some of the observed differences between implicit\nand explicit hand judgments could result from the decay\ncharacteristics of a single representation of hand direction. Our\ntask included a conspicuous temporal difference between implicit\nand explicit judgments that might have contributed to their\ndifferent characteristics: implicit judgments were inferred from the\nimmediate return movements after the end of the second stroke of\neach trial, whereas explicit judgments were finished about 5.7 s\nlater on average. When a single representation of hand direction\ndecays with the passage of time, its precision declines, and the\nvariability of responses based on it increases, and so do eventual\nconstant errors (e.g. [51]). Thus, the later explicit judgments of\nhand direction should be more variable than the earlier implicit\njudgments, even if both types of judgment were based on the same\nrepresentation. Furthermore, a constant error should be stronger\nfor later explicit judgments than for earlier implicit ones; in the\npresent study, the constant error was an offset in the counter-\nclockwise direction, which was observed in explicit judgments\nonly. Thus, the assumption of a decaying memory representation\nof hand direction could account at least for two of the observed\ndifferences between explicit and implicit judgments. However,\nother differences observed are quite unlikely to result from decay\ncharacteristics of a single representation of hand direction. Which\nof the differences between implicit and explicit judgments of hand\ndirection would disappear if the delays could be kept identical and\nwhich would remain is an important future question.\nThe opposite sequential effects for the explicit and the implicit\njudgments are perhaps the strongest evidence of different\nrepresentations. They followed the pattern of an automatic (or\nimplicit) facilitation of repetitions, and a controlled (or explicit)\nfacilitation of alternations, as it has been observed in binary\nchoice-reaction time tasks [52] and also in random-generation\ntasks [53–55]. In those tasks, there is only one type of response in\neach trial, a speeded response to an imperative signal or a self-\ndetermined choice from a given set of possible responses.\nFacilitation of repetitions tends to dominate at a fast rate of trials\n(e.g. inter-trial intervals of less than 1 s), but facilitation of\nalternations dominates at a slow rate.\nIn our task, there was only a single slow rate of trials, but there\nwere two responses in each trial: the return movement for the\nimplicit hand judgment and the subsequent slow movement for the\nexplicit judgment. The two types of facilitation were observed in\nthe two types of responses at a single slow rate. Facilitation of\nrepetitions was seen in implicit judgments of hand direction,\nsimilar to previous observations on sequential effects in grip force\nproduction [56–57] and saccadic movements toward visual targets\n[58]. In contrast, for the explicit judgments, the automatic\nfacilitation of repetitions was overridden by conscious expectations\nof the next type of judgment, which favor alternations rather than\nrepetitions [52–55]. The co-occurrence of facilitation both of\nalternations and repetitions for explicit and implicit judgments,\nrespectively, strongly suggests that they are based on distinct\nrepresentations: the weight of the implicit representation is\nmodulated by the past automatically, whereas the weight of the\nexplicit representation is modulated by the expected future, in\nparticular by subjective expectancies regarding the next type of\njudgment.\nIn addition, the facilitation of alternations was observable just\nwith one prior trial history for the older adults in explicit\njudgments of both cursor and hand direction, whereas it required\nmore than one prior trial history for the young adults. Thus, the\nfacilitation of alternations becomes stronger with aging, suggesting\nthat aging enhances controlled processes based on subjective\nexpectations. A similar age-induced facilitation toward alternations\nwas reported in a random generation task [59]. In contrast, there\nwas no age difference in facilitation of repetitions in implicit\njudgments of hand direction. Again, these discrepant aging effects\nof sequence between the explicit and implicit judgments point to\ndistinct representations that subserve the two types of judgment.\nSupporting Information\nText S1 Appendix.\n(DOC)\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Sarah Jacob, Johanna Maag, and Maia obidze for their support\nin data collection.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: MKR HH.
