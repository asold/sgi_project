At present, the technology of \ndissolved gas analysis (DGA) has been widely used in fault diagnosis of oil ‑immersed transformer. \nHowever, in the actual scene, the limited number of transformer fault samples and the uneven \ndistribution of different fault types often lead to low overall fault detection accuracy or a few types \nof fault misjudgment. Therefore, a transformer fault diagnosis method based on TLR‑ADASYN \nbalanced data set is presented. This method effectively addresses the issue of samples imbalance, \nreducing the impact on misjudgment caused by a few samples. It delves deeply into the correlation \nbetween the ratio of dissolved gas content in oil and fault type, eliminating redundant informations \nand reducing characteristic dimensions. The diagnostic model SO‑RF (Snake Optimization‑Random \nForest) is established, achieving a diagnostic accuracy rate of 97.06%. This enables online diagnosis \nof transformers. Comparative analyses using different sampling methods, various features, and \ndiverse diagnostic models were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In \nconclusion, validation was conducted using a public dataset, and the results demonstrate that the \nproposed method in this paper exhibits strong generalization capabilities.\nAs a hub in electrical power systems, transformers directly influence the stability and reliability of power system \noperations. Therefore, accurately understanding the health status of transformers is of paramount importance \nfor ensuring the safe and stable operation of the power system. When transformers experience insulation aging, \ngases such as  H2,  CH4,  C2H6,  C2H4,  C2H2, CO, and  CO2 dissolve in the insulating oil. The composition and con-\ncentration of dissolved gases can reflect the current operational status of the  transformer1. Common analysis \nmethods include the IEC three-ratio  method2, Rogers’ ratio  method3, and the Duval  method4. Recent studies \nhave optimized the coding of the three-ratio diagnosis using dissolved gases, further exploring transformer \n diagnostics5. Additionally, a method based on fuzzy three-ratio and case matching for transformer fault diagnosis \nhas been proposed, using the Euclidean distance method to calculate the similarity between target cases and \ncases in the selected subspace, with the method being validated through practical  examples6. However, these \nmethods, while operationally straightforward, lack depth in characterizing fault features and have limitations, \nwith fuzzy and unclear coding boundaries, leading to lower fault recognition  accuracy7. Scholars have proposed \nthe use of non-coded ratio  methods8,9 after conducting extensive comparative experiments and literature reviews. \nThese methods only require gas concentration ratios and utilize coding methods based on the percentage of \nkey gases in total gases or total hydrocarbon concentrations to reflect the relationship between features and \nfault types. In Ref. 10, by combining the non-coded ratio method with deep dense neural networks, a model’s \njudgment and generalization capabilities have been improved. In Ref. 11, causing the non-coded ratio method, \nnine-dimensional fault features were extracted and directly input into the XGBoost diagnostic model, achiev -\ning a diagnostic accuracy of 92.7%. However, during the diagnosis process, as the dimensionality of features \nincreases, redundant information also increases, leading to an increase in the computational complexity of the \nmodel. Thus, eliminating redundant information, reducing model computation time, and enhancing diagnostic \naccuracy are among the key focuses of this research.\nWith the development of machine learning theory, models such as Support Vector  Machines12,13 (SVM), \nConvolutional Neural  Networks14–16 (CNN), Extreme Learning  Machines17 (ELM), Long Short-Term Memory \n Networks18,19 (LSTM) and U-Net 20 have been effectively applied in classification and recognition. Y et, these \nmethods require a large number of training samples, and in practical transformer operation, the fault rate is low, \nwith varying frequencies of different fault types. It is challenging to meet the training requirements for artificial \nOPEN\nSchool of Mechanic Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin 132012, China. *email: xhaiqi0526@163.\ncom\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:23010  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49901-9\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nintelligence diagnostics with imbalanced small samples. Currently, experts and scholars have conducted extensive \nresearch to address the imbalance in datasets, proposing solutions from both the sample and algorithm per -\nspectives. Sample-based solutions include oversampling and undersampling methods. Undersampling achieves \nsample balance by removing some majority class samples but is prone to eliminating valuable information and \nis not widely  adopted21. Oversampling, on the other hand, balances the dataset by generating minority class \n samples22–24. Algorithm-based solutions primarily include ensemble  learning25 and cost-sensitive  methods26. \nThe ADASYN algorithm was used to augment minority class samples in a study, further enhancing equipment \nfault classification  performance27. Another study proposed enhancing sample intra-class feature aggregation by \nincreasing the number of clusters based on imbalance degree and K-means  clustering28. This improved sam-\nple identifiability. Although these methods have reduced the occurrence of misclassification and omission of \nminority class samples to some extent, they do not consider boundary samples and noise when synthesizing new \nsamples, resulting in the problem of fuzzy classification boundaries.\nTo address these issues, this paper tackles the problem of recognizing and classifying imbalanced small sample \ndata from both the sample and algorithm levels, proposing a transformer fault diagnosis method based on a TLR-\nADASYN balanced dataset. Firstly, the influence of noise and boundary samples is eliminated before balancing \nthe data. Secondly, to address the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods in characterizing complex internal \nfault features of transformers, multi-dimensional ratio features are constructed. These features delve deeper into \nthe correlation between the ratios of dissolved gas contents in the oil and the state types, eliminating the impact \nof redundant information and improving operational efficiency. Finally, a transformer fault diagnosis model is \nestablished, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through real-world data.\nSynthetic oversampling of boundary samples based on Tomek link\nADASYN minority‑class sample synthesis technique\nADASYN is an adaptive data synthesis method proposed by He et al.29. The method adaptively synthesizes dif-\nferent numbers of new samples according to the distribution of minority samples. The specific algorithm steps \nare as follows.\nSuppose the training set is D , which contains m samples, \n{\nxi,yi\n}\n,i= 1, 2,..., m  , x i is represented as a sam-\nple of the feature space X , yi ∈ Y = {−1, 1} . ms and ml represent the number of minority samples and majority \nsamples, respectively. Hence, ms ≤ ml and ms + ml = m  exist.\nCalculate class unbalance degree:\nwhere d ∈ (0, 1 ].\nCalculate the total number of samples of a few classes that need to be synthesized G:\nwhere β ∈ [0, 1 ] is the random number of the interval, representing the unbalance degree after the generation \nof new data. β = 1 indicates that the positive/negative ratio after sampling is 1:1.\nCalculate the proportion of majority classes in K-nearest neighbors:\nAccording to the sample weight, calculate the number of new samples that need to be generated for each \nminority sample.\nTo calculate the number of samples generated for each minority sample according to g:\nwhere S i is the synthesized new sample, X i is the i-th sample in the minority sample, (xiz − xi) is the m-dimen-\nsional vector representing the difference between the two minority samples, and /afii9838 is the random number in the \n[0, 1 ] interval.\nTLR‑ADASYN equilibrium dataset\nTomek30 improved the convolutional neural network in 1976 and proposed a new framework, which under -\nsampled the boundary samples without destroying the potential information. Two adjacent samples of different \nclasses can be connected into a Tomek Link. Its formation process is as follows:\nSuppose there are two types of sample sets C1 and C2 , and the corresponding samples are u i(i ∈ {l, ..., n }) \nand vi(i ∈ {l, ..., m }) respectively. Define distance dist(u i, vi) = �u i − vi� , If there are no other samples vp or \nuq that satisfy the conditions of dist\n(\nu q , vj\n)\n< dist\n(\nu i, vj\n)\n or dist\n(\nu q , vj\n)\n< dist\n(\nu i, vj\n)\n . Thus, \n(\nu i, vj\n)\n can form a \npair of Tomek chain.\nFor each ui ∈ C 1 , find the nearest vp ∈ C2 , form a chain l12 set and save it.\nFor each vj ∈ C 2 , find the nearest C2 , form a chain l12 set and save it.\n(1)d = m s\nm l\n,\n(2)G = (m l − m s) × β,\n(3)ri = /Delta1i\nK .\n(4)g = G ×ˆri.\n(5)Si = (xiz − xi) × /afii9838,\n(6)l12 =\n{(\nµi − vp\n)|µi ∈ C 1\n}\n.\n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:23010  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49901-9\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nl12 and l21 constitute Tomek link /Pi1:\nTomek Link reduces noise and boundary data by eliminating problematic pairs. To prevent the classifier \nfrom favoring the majority class too much, ADASYN expands the minority class data, addressing the bias issue.\nTransformer fault diagnosis model based on SO‑RF\nRandom forest\nRF31 belongs to one of the integrated algorithms and it is a set {h(X ,θk),k = 1, 2,..., n} composed of k decision \ntree classification models, the set is extracted by Booststrap sampling method, and the final classification result \nis obtained by subtree voting. The steps to build an RF classification model are as follows.\nStep 1 Using Booststrap sampling, samples with the same capacity are drawn from the training set N to \ngenerate the training subset.\nStep 2 It is assumed that the training subset has S features, and s samples selected at random are taken as the \nsplit feature subset and split by CART algorithm.\nStep 3 Repeat Step1 to Step2 for n times to generate subtree and build RF model.\nStep 4 Test sets are used to verify the reliability of RF models, and the final classification results are decided \nby voting.\nSnake optimization algorithm\nSnake Optimization  algorithm32 is a new meta-heuristic algorithm proposed in 2022, which mainly simulates the \nforaging and reproduction behavior of snakes.

The specific flow chart is shown in Fig.  2, \nwhich mainly includes two stages: offline model training and online recognition.\nThe off-line model training stage is mainly divided into the following four steps.\nStep 1 Standardize the collected DGA sample data, use TLR to remove the boundary data and noise of the \ntraining set, and then use ADASYN to expand the data of a few classes of samples.\nStep 2 The 18-dimensional feature is constructed by using the code-free ratio method, and the feature fusion \nis carried out by KPCA to remove the redundant information, and then divided into the training set, verification \nset and test set according to the proportion.\nStep 3 Optimize the parameters of n_estimators and max_depth of decision tree in RF model by SO algorithm.\nStep 4 Verify the accuracy of each iteration model with verification set.

To address \nthis limitation, this paper introduces several comprehensive accuracy metrics for transformer fault diagnosis, \nincluding the recall ratio (R), precision ratio (P), Kappa coefficient, and F1 index. The recall ratio (R) represents \nthe rate of missed detections for a specific fault type, while the precision ratio (P) represents the rate of misclas-\nsifications for a specific fault type. In practical scenarios, the recall rate may be high while the accuracy rate is \nlow, or vice versa. To balance both aspects, the F1 index is introduced. The F1 index is a measure of the harmonic \naverage between the recall rate and precision rate. A higher F1 value indicates better model performance. The \nspecific formula is as follows:\nwhere TP indicates that the fault sample is determined. And determine the correct number; FP represents the \nnumber of normal sample decisions made, but the decision is wrong; FN indicates the number of normal sample \ndecisions made, but the decision is wrong.\nThe Kappa coefficient formula is as follows:\nwhere  P0 is the sum of the number of correctly classified samples of each class divided by the total number of sam-\nples; Pe is the sum of the product of the actual and predicted quantities for all categories, divided by the square \nof the total number of samples. Generally, the results of Kappa calculation fall between [0,1] and can be divided \ninto five groups to represent different levels of consistency, namely: very low consistency, general consistency, \nmedium consistency, high consistency and almost complete consistency. When used as an evaluation index of \nthe model, the closer the calculated value is to 1, the better the diagnostic effect of the model is.\nExample analysis\nIn this paper, 338 sets of monitoring data provided by a power supply company in Zhejiang, China, were selected \nas a sample set, including 7 different operating states of medium discharge and overheat, low temperature over-\nheat, high temperature overheat, partial discharge, low energy discharge, high energy discharge and normal, \nwhich were respectively represented by labels 1–7. Each operating state includes five characteristic gases,  H2, \n CH4,  C2H4,  C2H6 and  C2H2. The number of samples for each category is shown in Table 1.\nTransformer fault data preprocessing and feature selection\nWhen the transformer fails, the composition and concentration of dissolved gas in the insulation oil will change. \nTherefore, the content of dissolved  H2,  CH4,  C2H4,  C2H6 and  C2H2 in the transformer oil is used as the basis for \ntransformer fault diagnosis. The content of each gas is normalized, as shown in formula (25):\nwhere x i and x∗\ni  are the characteristics before and after normalization; xi max and xi min represents the original \nminimum and maximum values before normalization. In order to deeply explore the correlation between the \nratio of dissolved gas content in oil and the fault type, the 18-dimensional joint feature is constructed by using \nthe non-coding ratio method. Where, THC =  CH4 +  C2H4 +  C2H6 +  C2H2, ALL =  H2 +  CH4 +  C2H4 +  C2H6 +  C2H2, \nas shown in Table 2.\n(21)R = TP/(TP + FN),\n(22)P = TP/(TP + FP),\n(23)F1 = 2PR/(P + R),\n(24)k = (P0 − Pe)\n/\n(1 − Pe),\n(25)x ∗\ni = x i − x i min\nx i max − x i min\n,\nTable 1.

Such data imbalance could lead to the misclassification of a few samples as normal, resulting in \ndiminished recognition accuracy. To address this issue, this paper employs the TLR algorithm to filter out noise \nand boundary data from the training set. Subsequently, the ADASYN algorithm is utilized to augment the num-\nber of fault samples. The distribution of sample quantities before and after this processing is presented in Table 3. \nFeature selection\nTo mitigate the inclusion of redundant information in fault features, Kernel Principal Component Analysis \n(KPCA) was utilized to integrate the constructed 18-dimensional joint features.

This signifies that these initial seven principal components capture over 85% of the explanatory \npower inherent in all principal components. Consequently, the first seven principal components are chosen as \nthe inputs for the transformer fault diagnosis model. To further underscore the efficacy of KPCA feature fusion, \ntwo-dimensional scatter plots are generated for distinct principal components, as visualized in Fig. 4. The scatter \nplot in Fig. 4 reveals that the clustering effect is most pronounced in the first and second principal components, \nwith the clustering effect diminishing progressively for subsequent principal components.\nFault diagnosis result\nFusion features extracted from KPCA were divided into training set, test set and verification set according to \nthe ratio of 6:2:2, as shown in Table 5.\nTo obtain the optimal diagnostic model, the SO algorithm was employed to optimize the n_estimators and \nmax_depth of decision trees within the RF model. A population size of 30 and a maximum iteration count of 100 \nwere set. The search range for the number of decision trees was (0, 100), and the search range for decision tree \ndepth was (0, 20). The simulations in this study were conducted using MATLAB 2018b software, and the resulting \nconfusion matrix is shown in Fig.  5. From Fig. 5, it can be observed that out of the 204 samples in the test set, \n198 were correctly diagnosed, resulting in an overall accuracy of 97.06%. Specifically, the accuracy of diagnosing \nmedium and low-temperature overheating, partial discharge, and combined discharge and overheating faults was \n100%. Based on the data in the confusion matrix, the diagnostic model’s precision (P), recall (R), and F1-score \nwere calculated as 0.9704, 0.9711, and 0.9707, respectively. Additionally, the Kappa coefficient of the diagnostic \nmodel was 0.9659, indicating almost perfect agreement, further confirming the high fault recognition accuracy \nand excellent stability of the model proposed in this study.\nResults and discussion\nQualitative and quantitative analysis of TLR‑ADASYN data equalization\nTo validate the effectiveness of the TRL-ADASYN sampling method, this study conducts a comprehensive perfor-\nmance comparison of various sampling methods, combining qualitative observations with quantitative analysis. \nFirstly, to visually demonstrate that the TRL-ADASYN sampling method successfully augments the sample size \nwhile preserving essential data characteristics, the study employs t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding \n(t-SNE)34 to map transformer dissolved gas data into a three-dimensional space for visualization, as depicted \nin Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, the blue dots represent samples after applying the sampling method, while the orange dots \nrepresent samples before sampling. Within this three-dimensional coordinate graph, it becomes evident that the \ndata distribution patterns of different fault types remain consistent both before and after the implementation of \nthe TRL-ADASYN sampling method. Furthermore, the statistical characteristics align, providing compelling \nevidence for the validity and reliability of the augmented data.\nSecondly, we conducted a quantitative comparison of the performance of various sampling methods, evaluat-\ning five different treatment approaches, namely, non-equilibrium dataset, random oversampling, SMOTE over-\nsampling, ADASYN oversampling, and ROS downsampling. The resulting diagnostic outcomes are presented in \nTable 6. As illustrated in Table 6, the diagnostic accuracy of the original dataset, without undergoing any balanc-\ning processing, stood at 88.24%, accompanied by a Kappa coefficient of 0.8654. The adoption of oversampling \nor downsampling algorithms led to varying degrees of improvement in diagnostic accuracy. However, when the \ndownsampling algorithm was employed, valuable information was lost due to the removal of a portion of the \nmajority class sample data. Comparatively, in contrast to ADASYN, SMOTE, and random oversampling, the \ndiagnostic accuracy of the method proposed in this paper increased by 0.59%, 1.96%, and 4.41%, respectively. \nFurthermore, the Kappa coefficient also witnessed an increase of 0.0057, 0.0224, and 0.0505, respectively. The \nexperimental results conclusively demonstrate that the approach introduced in this paper effectively addresses \nthe issue of insufficient sample distribution in certain classes, mitigating the potential decline in diagnostic \naccuracy caused by a model’s inclination toward the majority class samples.\nTable 4.

In this study, \noversampled IEC three-ratio features, Rogers’ four-ratio features, 18-dimensional joint features, and the first 7 \ndimensions of features extracted using principal component analysis were analyzed and compared, as shown \nin Fig. 7. In the figure, the red dots represent samples in the test set that were correctly classified, while the blue \ncircles represent samples with their true classifications. The scattered points indicate samples misclassified as \nother categories, and a higher number of scattered sample points indicates lower diagnostic accuracy. From \nFigure 4.  Scatter plot of different principal elements.\n10\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2023) 13:23010  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49901-9\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nFig. 7, it can be observed that the use of IEC three-ratio features and Rogers’ four-ratio features have more scat-\ntered points compared to the 18-dimensional joint features, indicating that the 18-dimensional joint features \nare better at exploring the relationship between fault types and dissolved gases in the oil. Table 7 shows that the \ncorresponding Kappa coefficients for the four different features are 0.9433, 0.9209, 0.8821, and 0.8543. Using \nKPCA fusion features reduced the feature dimensionality, significantly improving fault diagnosis accuracy, thus \nconfirming the superiority of this method.\nComparative analysis of different fault diagnosis models\nTo illustrate the effectiveness of this diagnosis method, comparison and analysis were made with GA-XGBoost \ndiagnosis model proposed in Ref.35, PSO-BiLSTM diagnosis model proposed in Ref.36 and WOA-SVM diagno-\nsis model proposed in Ref. 37, and the diagnostic results were shown in Table  8. It shows the superiority of the \ndiagnostic model proposed in this paper.\nThe 7-dimensional fused and dimensionally reduced features were separately input into three different mod-\nels, GA-XGBoost, PSO-BiLSTM, and WOA-SVM, for comparative analysis against the diagnostic model pro-\nposed in this study. The diagnostic results are shown in Fig.  8, and the model evaluation metrics are compared \nin Table 9. From the information presented in the figure and the table, it can be observed that the SO-RF model \nhad the fewest misclassified samples, resulting in an accuracy improvement of 1.47%, 2.45%, and 3.43% com -\npared to the GA-XGBoost, PSO-BiLSTM, and WOA-SVM diagnostic models, respectively. In comparison with \nthe recognition accuracy in the original literature, the improvement was 1.91%, 1.13%, and 1.54%, respectively. \nFurthermore, in terms of evaluation metrics such as recall, precision, and F1 score, the method proposed in this \nstudy exhibits more stable performance compared to other models. From the perspective of the Kappa coefficient, \nthe method presented in this study achieved a score of 0.9546, indicating almost perfect agreement. This further \nunderscores the effectiveness of the feature extraction method and fault diagnostic model proposed in this study.\nThe generalization performance analysis of the model\nAdditional datasets were employed to assess the model’s ability to generalize. Specifically, the IEC TC  1038 public \ndataset was selected for this purpose. In accordance with the categorization provided in Ref. 39, transformer fault \nTable 5.

In addition, the use of KPCA \nfor feature fusion can avoid the appearance of redundant information and further improve the accuracy \nof the model.\n(2) Compared with GA-XGBoost, PSO-BiLSTM and WOA-SVM diagnostic models, the accuracy of SO-RF \nmodel proposed in this paper reached 96.08%, and the Kappa coefficient reached 0.9546, which were \nsuperior to other models. The results show that SO-RF model has better stability and generalization.\nHowever, using dissolved gases in oil as an early diagnostic method for transformers, relying solely on these \ngases as input features is insufficient to reflect the overall condition of the transformer. Therefore, future work \ncan collect vibration signal data as additional input for the model. Furthermore, the diagnostic model proposed \nin this paper did not take into account external factors and the influence of the transformer’s inherent charac -\nteristics on fault diagnosis accuracy. Subsequent research should consider the impact of external factors on the \nfault diagnosis model.\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are not publicly available due [The data set is a \ncompany secret] but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
