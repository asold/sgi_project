As the medical industry, diagnostic capabilities, \nand technologies for treating primary tumors evolve, \nthe survival rates for individuals diagnosed with pri -\nmary brain tumors have increased significantly [1, 2]. \nOpen Access\n*Correspondence:  berzina.guna@gmail.com\n1 Riga Stradiņš University, Riga, Latvia\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 18Ģiga et al. Health Qual Life Outcomes          (2021) 19:234 \nTumor localization, anatomical distribution, and volume \nare determinants before and after primary treatment. \nThe most common symptoms for brain tumors usually \ninclude headache, nausea, vomiting, partial and gener -\nalized seizures, cognitive impairment, and ataxia. These \nsymptoms may also arise from common treatment strate-\ngies used for brain tumor patients such as chemotherapy, \nradiation therapy, and surgery. It is estimated that  75% \nof all patients with brain tumors show symptoms of focal \nneurological deficiency [3], which greatly affects one’s \nlevel of functioning, as well as the quality of life.\nNumerous articles discuss the role of rehabilitation in \ntumor cases, while others discuss the positive effects of \nrehabilitation for patients with brain tumors compared to \npatients with stroke or after a traumatic brain injury [4, \n5]. All of these articles demonstrate positive outcomes in \nrestoring functioning [6, 7]. Bartolo M. et al. have dem -\nonstrated that rehabilitation is very effective if initiated as \nearly as possible after primary treatment for brain tumor \npatients [5].\nTo assess the rehabilitation needs and outcomes for this \npopulation, a specific functional disability assessment \ntool is necessary [8]. The use of appropriate assessment \ntools could improve rehabilitation planning that in turn \nwould lead to better outcomes, including patients’ quality \nof life. Currently, no standardized protocols are provided \nfor evaluation of persons with brain tumors. The Interna-\ntional Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health \n(ICF) provides a framework for coding large-scale health \ninformation, a common standardized language for iden -\ntifying and comparing functional assessment tools, and \nprovides valuable information to develop an evidence-\nbased standardized evaluation protocol for patients with \nbrain tumor [9].\nThe aim of this study was to determine the most fre -\nquently utilized functional assessment instruments for \npatients with brain tumors, compare their contents, using \nthe International Classification of Functioning, Disability \nand Health, and analyze their psychometric properties.\nMethods\nIdentification of assessment tools\nA scoping review was conducted according to Joanna \nBriggs institute guidelines [10]. PubMed, ScienceDirect, \nand ProQuest databases were searched (last updated \nAugust 2020) for publications since 2000 using the fol -\nlowing keywords: “brain neoplasm” or “meningioma” or \n“glioblastoma” or “intracranial neoplasm” or “brain can -\ncer” or “outcome assessment” or “treatment outcome” \nor functional outcome mentioned in the title/abstract. \nStudies referring in the title or abstract to assessment \ntools used to assess people diagnosed with brain tumors \nolder than 18  years were included. Original research \nstudies randomized controlled clinical trials, observa -\ntional studies, cross-sectional studies, qualitative studies \nwere included in which authors reported using a tool to \nassess functioning in persons with brain tumors. Studies \nwere included even if the tool was not initially designed \nto assess functioning. Studies were excluded if they \naddressed genetic, laboratory, and animal research. Sys -\ntematic reviews, secondary analyses of published data, \nvalidity studies, protocols, letters, were also excluded \nfrom this report. All searches were limited to journal arti-\ncles written in English; the search results were compiled \nin the reference management system EndNote where \nduplicates were removed. A summary of the search pro -\ncedure is shown in Fig. 1.\nData collection was based on the Joanna Briggs Insti -\ntute Manual for Evidence Synthesis Chapter 11.2 Devel -\nopment of a Scoping Review protocol [10]. General study \ndata (year of publication, country, study design), available \ndata on participants (number, diagnosis), and assessment \ntools used in the study were recorded. Assessment tools \nthat were used in more than 9% of all studies the scop -\ning review using frequency analysis. The choice of this \ncut-off point was based on the distribution of frequen -\ncies as well as on substantive considerations of the list of \ninstruments.\nLinking to the ICF\nAll assessment instruments identified in the study meet -\ning selection criteria were classified using the ICF linking \nguidelines. The ICF linking guidelines state that before \nstarting the process of linking health-status measures to \nthe ICF categories, identification of all meaningful con -\ncepts within each item of the health status measure needs \nto be performed. According to the rules, the interval of \ntime cannot be linked to the ICF, also, if a meaningful \nconcept of an item is explained by examples, both the \nconcept and the examples are to be linked, while tech -\nnical measures can be linked by defining the purpose \nand then linking it with the ICF category [11, 12]. Two \nindependent medical professionals (authors LG and SS) \nseparately identified the meaningful concepts within the \nanalyzed instruments and linked them to the ICF con -\ncepts. The raters met and discussed any discrepancies to \nachieve a consensus classification for the instruments and \nGB served as a third rater, in case the consensus could not \nbe reached. Identified categories within each of the ana -\nlyzed instruments were organized according to the struc -\nture of the ICF. Further, the content of the instruments \nwas compared to identify categories that overlap between \nthe instruments and those that are unique for specific \ntools. The perspective adopted in health information and \ncategorization of response for self-assessment tools were \nalso reported [11].\nPage 3 of 18\nĢiga et al. Health Qual Life Outcomes          (2021) 19:234 \n \nPsychometric properties\nFollowing the search methodology developed by PubMed \n[13], the electronic database MEDLINE (PubMed) was \nsearched for studies that reflect the psychometric prop -\nerties of a particular assessment tool. First, a search was \nperformed using a diagnosis-specific MeSH terms and \nkey words identified in the search methodology and the \nnames of assessment tools. Headline screening identified \nstudies that reflected one of the psychometric proper -\nties of a given instrument (reliability: internal coherence; \ntest/retest method, evaluator reliability. Validity: content \nvalidity; criterion validity; construct validity) specific \nto patients with brain tumors. If psychometric proper -\nties for chosen assessment tools were not identified, the \nsearch was repeated excluding diagnosis-specific MeSH \nterms, thus conducting a search for studies covering dif -\nferent diagnoses. Headline screening then identified \nstudies that reflected one of the psychometric properties \nof a given instrument for various diagnoses. The interpre-\ntation of the psychometric properties is given in Table 1.\nRecords iden/g415ﬁed  through  \ndatabase se archin g\n(n = 9721 )\nScreeningIncluded Eligibility noitacifitnedI\nAddi/g415onal ar/g415c le s iden/g415ﬁ ed  \nby reviewing the references \nof the 5 6i ncluded studie s\n(n = 32)\nRecord sa /g332er duplicate s remove d\n(n =  9718 )\nRecord ss creene d\n(n =  9718 )\nRecords excluded\n(n =  9 627)\nFull-text ar/g415cles assessed  \nfor eligibilit y\n(n = 91 )\nFull-text ar/g415cles excluded\n(n = 35 )\nStudies included in the  \nrepo t\n(n =   56)\nStudies included in the  \nrevi ew\n(n =   88)\nFig. 1 Flow diagram of the systematic literature search\nPage 4 of 18Ģiga et al. Health Qual Life Outcomes          (2021) 19:234 \nResults\nIdentification of assessment tools\nThe initial search strategy returned 9721 articles. The \nduplicates were removed, titles and summaries were \nrevised, following the exclusion of articles that did not \nmeet the selection criteria, in result 56 articles were \nincluded in the scoping review.\nTo make the search as comprehensive as possible, ref -\nerences from the 56 included articles were studied and \nan additional 32 articles were included after applying the \nselection criteria.\nAs a result, a total of 88 studies were included in the \nreport; 31 were administered in the United States, 42 in \nEurope (8 in Italy, 8 in the Netherlands, 6 in Norway, 4 \nin France, Germany and England each 3, Austria, Tur -\nkey, Sweden 2 studies each, Poland, Switzerland, Den -\nmark, and Finland each 1), 2 in Australia, 7 in Canada, \nand 4 in Asian countries (Korea, Israel, Iran). The stud -\nies look at groups of patients with various brain tumor \ndiagnoses. The 74 articles included patients with primary \ntumors, of which 26 were diagnosed with glioma, 3- oli -\ngodendroglioma, 1- oligoastrocytoma, 3- astrocytoma, \n4- adenoma, 1- meningioma, 1 case study had a mixed \ngroup with patients suffering from meningioma and glio -\nblastomas. 28 of the studies did not categorize patients by \ntheir histologic type; instead, patients with primary brain \ntumors were evaluated. 9 studies evaluated patients with \nsecondary brain tumors or with brain metastases. In 4 of \nthe included studies, the functional abilities of patients \nwith brain tumors are compared to those of a stroke \npatient or a patient with a brain injury.\nAll instruments mentioned in the articles were identi -\nfied, yielding 86 assessment tools which are summarized \nin Additional file  1. According to research methodol -\nogy, 9 assessment tools that were used in more than 9% \nof the research articles included in the study were used \nfor further analysis: A list of these instruments, their \nabbreviations, and the number of articles that have used \nthat instrument are summarized in Table  2. Out of nine \ninstruments included in the study,\ntwo are specific for patients with brain tumors: ORTC \nQuality of Life Questionnaire-Brain Neoplasm 20 \n(EORTC QLQ-BN20), Functional Assessment of Can -\ncer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), one is specific for patients \nwith oncological diseases—Karnofsky Performance Scale \n(KPS), four: Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), \nFunctional Independence Measure (FIM), Trial Making \nTest (TMT), Barthel Index (BI) and 36-Item Short Form \nHealth Survey (SF-36)) are used for patients with various \ndiagnoses. The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire 30 \n(EORTC QLQ-C30) has been shown to be valid, reliable, \nand responsive in patients with brain tumors as well as \nin patients with various oncological diseases. Similar, to \nthe 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), it is used \nin patients with brain tumors as well as in patients with \nvarious diseases.\nTable 1 The interpretation of the psychometric properties\nCronbach’s ɑ, Chronbach’s ɑ coefficient; ICC, interclass correlation coefficient\nReliability\nInternal reliability + Cronbach’s ɑ or ICC ≥ 0.70\n− Cronbach’s ɑ or ICC < 0.70\nTest/retest method + ICC ≥ 0.70 or Pearson correlation coefficient/ Spearman rank correlation coefficient ≥ 0.80\n- ICC < 0.70 or Pearson correlation coefficient/Spearman rank correlation coefficient < 0.80\nInterrater reliability + ICC ≥ 0.70 or Pearson correlation coefficient/ Spearman rank correlation coefficient ≥ 0.80\n− ICC < 0.70 or Pearson correlation coefficient/Spearman rank correlation coefficient < 0.80\nValidity\nContent validity + The content of the assessment instrument is adequate, comprehensive, questions and tasks chosen to adequately reflect the \ncontent to be evaluated\n- Not all selected questions and tasks reflect the content, content is not relevant, comprehensive\nCriterion validity + Significant and stable relation between measurement and another instrument (r ≥ 0.70) or with start/end measurement\n− Poor measurement correlation with another instrument (r < 0.70) or start / end measurement\nStructural validity + Correlation with instruments measuring the same ≥ 0.50 or correlation higher for unrelated elements in the instrument than \nfor unrelated ones\n- Correlation with instruments measuring the same < 0.50 or correlation with related elements in the instrument is lower than \nunrelated ones\nResponsiveness\nResponsiveness + Able to detect clinically significant changes over time\n− Cannot detect clinically significant changes over time\nPage 5 of 18\nĢiga et al.

Detailed comparison of the \ncontent between assessment tools are shown in Tables  4, \n5,  and 6 for components of Body Functions and Struc -\ntures, Activities and Participation and Environmental \nFactors, respectively. No appropriate ICF category was \nfound for 54 items following the ICF linking guidelines.\nEvaluating all 9 assessment tools, the most related ICF \ncategories in the body function domain were b140 atten -\ntion functions (n = 5), b144 memory functions (n = 4), \nb156 perceptual functions (n = 4), b280 sensation of pain \n(n = 4) and b730 muscle power functions (n = 4). FACT-\nBR, BN-20 and MMSE contained most concepts related \nto the Body functions and Structures. Five out of nine \nanalyzed assessment tools included concepts on d450 \nwalking and d540 dressing. The BN-20 questionnaire \ncontained meaningful concepts that could be linked to \n23  s level categories of the Activities and Participation, \ncovering all domains of this component. FIM was linked \nto 21 categories that did not cover chapters of Major life \nareas and Community, social and civic life.\nPsychometric properties\nFor psychometric properties that are specific for brain \ntumor diagnosis, search in PubMed yielded 578 results \nfor KPS, 18 for MMSE, 55 for EORTC QLQ-C30, 6 for \nEORTC QLQ-BN20, 5 for FIM, 36 for TMT, 14 for BI, \n21 for FACT-Br, and 4 for SF-36. Headline screening \nresulted in identifying 1 study for EORTC QLQ-C30, 4 \nstudies for EORTC QLQ-BN20, 3 studies for FACT- Br, \nand 1 study for SF-36. A search strategy for various diag -\nnoses was implemented for the remaining assessment \ninstruments as well as SF-36 and EORTC QLQ-C30 due \nto the  previous search strategy yielding only 1 result. \nAs a result, for further analysis, 4 articles for KPS, 5 for \nMMSE, 1 + 5 for EORTC QLQ-C30, 4 for EORTC QLQ-\nBN20, 10 for FIM, 2 for TMT, 7 for BI 3 for FACT-Br, and \n8 for SF-36 were included in this review. The psychomet -\nric properties for assessment instruments EORTC QLQ-\nC30, EORTC QLQ-BN20, FACT-Br, and SF-36, that are \nspecific to brain tumor diagnosis are summarized in \nTable 7. The psychometric properties analyzed in mixed \ndiagnosis studies for EORTC QLQ-C30, MMSE, SF-36, \nBI, FIM, KPS, TMT are summarized below, see Table 8.\nDiscussion\nThis study identified nine rehabilitation assessment \ninstruments that have most commonly been referred to \nin the literature for adults with brain tumors, that cover \nall components of the ICF, and have good psychometric \nproperties. As far as the authors are aware, this is the only \nscoping review of assessment instruments used for adults \nwith brain tumors. However, this scoping review did not \nidentify one unique assessment instrument for the target \ngroup. This patient group is specific in a way that there is \nno unifying patient-specific clinical set of symptoms and \ntheir symptoms depend on various other factors [14].\nFive of these tools are used for objective assessment: \nKPS, MMSE, FIM, TMT, BI, four are self-assessment \ntools: FACT-Br, SF-36, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ- \nBN20. One of these tools (KPS) is used to assess physi -\ncal activity, two (MMSE; TMT) are cognitive function \nassessment tools, FACT-Br, SF-36, EORTC QLQ-C30, \nEORTC QLQ-BN20 measures the  quality of life, and \nboth, FIM and BI are used to assess disability.\nThe most frequently used assessment instrument is the \nKarnofsky Performance Scale as it is used as a criterion \nfor the selection of participants by measuring their level \nof physical activity [15]. This assessment tool is devel -\noped for a  general assessment of oncological patients \n[16] and reflects the overall ability to perform usual daily \nactivities (component of Activities and Participation of \nthe ICF) in the context of help needed from other people \n(Environmental Factors).\nFour of these instruments are used to evaluate patients \nwith brain tumors: EORTC QLQ-C30; EORTC QLQ-\nBN20; FACT-Br, SF-36; they are all linked to the quality \nof life. Moreover, the EORTC team recommends that \nEORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BN20 tools be used \ntogether [17]. These two tools cover both functioning \ncomponents of the ICF and from the perspective of con -\ntent, complement each other. EORTC QLQ-C30 contains \nmore specific questions on problems specific to patients \nwith brain tumors [18, 19]. The EORTC QLQ-C30 and \nthe EORTC QLQ-BN20 provide comprehensive infor -\nmation about the patient’s quality of life, but this is often \noverlooked in studies identified in this scoping review. \nThe FACT-Br questionnaire has been used less and it \nhas as good properties in terms of intra-rater reliability \nand structural validity as other two specific quality of life \nmeasurements, contains problems that have not been \nincluded in any of the previous tools, and can clearly be \nimportant for this population, such as handling stress or \ndriving a car. It also considers important Environmental \nfactors, such as help and attitudes of family members and \nfriends, as well as health professionals. Some important \nconcepts also overlap with the SF-36 that have developed \nas a multipurpose tool that is used for assessment of \nfunctional health and well-being [20] and has also been \nwidely used for patient-reported outcomes in popula -\ntions with different diagnoses [21]. Therefore, this could \nbe a  good choice to use the SF-36, if the comparison \nbetween populations is needed.\nBetween the most used assessment tools, the FIM and \nBI have been listed. These instruments are non-specific \nto diagnosis, and both have been widely used in different \nPage 7 of 18\nĢiga et al.

Both scales, the FIM \nand the BI, are performance-based assessment tools \nand both analyze the level of independence in the most \nimportant activities of daily living. Their psychometric \nproperties have been profoundly analyzed, and the ceil -\ning effect for the BI can be observed when compared \nto the FIM [25]. However, the psychometric proper -\nties of the objective assessment instruments specific for \nthe patient group have not been proven; therefore, their \npsychometric properties were demonstrated in patients \nsuffering from stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or \nsimilar neurological conditions. Interestingly, two neu -\nropsychological assessment tools (the MMSE and the \nTMT) are mentioned among the most frequently used \nfor persons with brain tumors. It can be explained by the \nfact that cognitive impairments are a common symptom \nin patients with brain tumors [4]. Both instruments focus \nmostly on the cognitive functions of the component of \nthe Body Functions and Structures of the ICF and both \nare performance-based. However, the psychometric \nproperties of the MMSE have been better documented.\nThe International Classification of Functioning, Dis -\nability and Health (ICF) provides the  user with a broad \nspectrum of health outcomes, including physical and cog-\nnitive functioning. By linking available assessment tools \nto this concept, it is possible to analyze the content of the \navailable instruments and choose the appropriate one for \nthe problem that is being measured and, consequently, \ntreated [ 11, 12]. Using the ICF framework, it was pos -\nsible to link most elements identified in the assessment \ninstruments to certain categories. Some elements could \nnot be linked since they covered topics such as quality \nof life, personal factors, or certain elements not defined \nin the ICF. Body Function categories were dominated \nby MMSE, TMT, EORTC QLQ-BN20, EORTC QLQ-\nC30, activity and participation categories—FIM, BI, KPS, \nSF-36 but FACT-Br viewed these two domains equally. \nEnvironmental factors were assessed by EORTC QLQ-\n30, FACT-Br, FIM, BI, and KPS. Given that the clinical \npicture of brain tumor patients is similar to that of other \nneurological conditions, such as stroke [6] or TBI [7], the \nICF Core Sets were reviewed for stroke and TBI [26], and \ntheir categories were compared to categories identified in \nthis scoping review. Comprehensive core sets for stroke \nlisted 13 categories in body functions and structures, \n14 in activities and participation, and 23 categories in \nenvironmental factors that were not identified in assess -\nment instruments analyzed in this study. Comprehensive \ncore sets for TBI listed 10 categories in body functions \ndomain, 22 in activities and participation, and 28 catego -\nries in environmental factor domain that were not identi-\nfied in any of 9 assessment instruments analyzed within \nthis study. This can be explained by the fact that the most \nfrequently used assessment instruments do not cover all \nthe possible impairments for people with brain tumors.\nGiven that the ICF Core Sets for stroke and TBI were \ncompared to categories identified in this review and they \nproved to be overall covering similar areas it can be con -\ncluded that all 9 assessment tools identified in this study \ncan be appropriate and specific assessment instruments \nfor patients with brain tumors, as they have been proven \nvalid, reliable, and responsive to a variety of neurological \nconditions.

First, \nthe quality of the studies included in the scoping review \nwas not assessed, as the purpose of the scoping review \nwas to identify the most frequently used assessment \ninstruments. Second, the authors included only nine out \nof 86 assessment tools for further analysis, which were \nused in more than 9% of the study articles included in the \nstudy. That runs the risk that this analysis of assessment \ninstruments does not use some of the more recently \ndeveloped assessment tools, which may be better suited \nfor the specific patient group but are not used frequently \nenough in research articles to be included in the analysis.\nConclusions\nBetween the nine most frequently used assessment \ninstruments in clinical studies, one was a generic tool for \nan  overall description of activity level for patients with \ndiagnosis of cancer, three were diagnosis-specific self-\nassessment tools, one was a multipurpose tool for assess -\nment of functionality and health status, two were widely \nused tools in rehabilitation for assessment of activities \nof daily living, and two were neurocognitive tests. These \ntools cover all components of the International Classi -\nfication of Functioning, Disability and Health and have \nproven to have good psychometric properties; however, \nthe assessment tools that are not diagnosis-specific, still \nmust be validated for the brain tumor population.\nSince the content and administration vary, the choice \nof the tool used for assessment of patients with brain \ntumor depends on the clinical question posed, as well as \nthe aim of the use of this tool.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. \norg/ 10. 1186/ s12955- 021- 01863-0.\nAdditional file 1.
