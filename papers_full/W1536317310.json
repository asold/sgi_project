Recognizing the urgent need to systematically capture \nand preserve these data for future re-use, the scientific community has been responding to the \ndata explosion by developing minimal reporting standards, standardized data sharing formats, \nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 1062\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\nand databases for a wide variety of technologies and research \nfields (Fiehn et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2008; Field et al., 2010; \nFernie et al., 2011). As the challenges of capture, storage, and \nexchange are overcome in new fields, we anticipate increased \nefforts to make accumulated data more immediately useful \nto biologists by equipping databases with advanced analyti-\ncal capabilities extending beyond simple search, browse, and \nvisualization functions. In this article, we describe one such \neffort in the field of metabolomics to turn a database of experi-\nmentally observed metabolite responses into an analytical tool \nby equipping it with metabolite response pattern-based search \nfunctionality.\nA well-known example of an added-value metabolomics \ndatabase is the Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) (Kopka \net  al., 2005). The earliest GMD versions focused on sharing \nreference mass-spectral and retention index (MSRI) reference \nlibraries for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) \npeak identification, providing basic browse and text search \noptions. Subsequent versions added value to these libraries by \nintroducing new tools for MSRI data-based search with chemical \nsub-structure prediction so users can search their own spectra \nagainst the collection of reference spectra to identify their peaks \nand, in the case of unmatched spectra, gain clues about possible \nchemical structures (Hummel et al., 2010).\nThe GMD developers recently introduced new features to \nsupport the storage and visualization of experimental metabolite \nlevel data, the comparison of metabolite levels between different \nexperimental treatments and a novel “profile search” tool that \nsearches experimental metabolite level profiles (signal intensities \nof metabolites within a single sample class) against a database \nof reference profiles to find similar profiles using a dot-product \nsimilarity measure.\n1 To our knowledge, formal descriptions of \nthese latest features are not yet published. Nevertheless, by devel-\noping the Profile Search feature, the GMD has become one of the \nfirst metabolomics databases to provide biological pattern-based \nsearch capabilities and thereby evolve beyond being simply a \nwell-indexed archive of biological information with basic search, \nbrowse, and visualization functions to become a biological ana-\nlytical/annotation tool in the truest sense, analogous to a nucleo-\ntide sequence database equipped with a nucleotide sequence \nsimilarity search algorithm.\nIn the fields of transcriptomics and proteomics, a form \nof pattern-based database searching known as enrichment \nanalysis (EA) has become extremely popular. The widespread \nuptake of EA to aid interpretation of gene product expression \nprofiles is strongly evident in the literature. In their review, \nHuang et al. (2009) identified some 68 different software tools \nfor performing EA on transcriptomic/proteomic data (Huang \net al., 2009). At the time of publication, the article describing \nthe use of DAVID, one of the earliest EA tools based on Fisher’s \nExact Test, had been cited over 3000 times (Huang et al., 2008). \nThe article describing the first example of Gene Set Enrichment \nAnalysis (GSEA; using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) had \nbeen cited over 6000 times (Subramanian et al., 2005). Other \n1 http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/\nexamples of database-driven tools and approaches matching \nsignature patterns within gene expression profiles for the pur -\npose of inferring functional links include The Connectivity \nMap ( Lamb et  al., 2006), OncoMine (Rhodes et  al., 2004, \n2007), EXALT (Wu et al., 2009), SIGNATURE (Chang et al., \n2011), ExpTreeDB (Ni et  al., 2014), LINCS Canvas Browser \n(Duan et  al., 2014), Galahad (Laenen et  al., 2015), AtCAST \n(Kakei and Shimada, 2015), Drug-Path (Zeng et al., 2015), and \nNFFinder (Setoain et al., 2015). Clearly, there is very active \ndevelopment and strong uptake within the omics community \nof tools that can help make sense of molecular expression pro-\nfiles by matching query patterns to large databases of reference \npatterns.\nIn contrast to the field of transcriptomics, there are currently \nfew examples of EA and no published tool allowing a public \nrepository of metabolite response patterns to be searched on the \nbasis of a query response pattern. Several properties of metabo-\nlites promise to make the development of metabolite response \npattern-based database search tools particularly rewarding:\n 1.\n M\netabolite contents provide an integrated readout of pro-\ncesses occurring at the transcriptional, translational, and \nphysicochemical levels of biochemical organization and are \ntherefore of great diagnostic utility.\n 2.\n A\ncquisition of untargeted metabolomics data is generally \nrelatively inexpensive and high-throughput compared to \nacquisition of proteomic and transcriptomic data.\n 3.\n M\nany metabolites are common to different organisms and \nmeasuring them in new model systems does not require \ncostly genome or transcriptome sequencing.\nHowever, metabolites also present unique challenges for the \ndevelopment of pattern-based database search tools:\n 1.\n R\nelative to gene identifiers, metabolite identifiers are poorly \nstandardized across the literature  –  a single metabolite is \noften referred to by many different identifiers in the litera-\nture thus making mapping more difficult for developers.\n 2.\n M\netabolomics analyses often detect many metabolites that, \ndespite being of biological importance and diagnostic value, \nare structurally unidentified.\n 3.\n C\nomparably few public metabolomics databases are designed \nto store experimentally observed metabolic phenotypes.\n 4.\n S\nubmission of metabolomics datasets to public databases is \nnot enforced by journals to the same extent as submission of \ntranscriptomics and proteomics data.\n 5.\n A\ns a consequence of points 3 and 4, systematically annotated \nreference metabolic phenotypes are less readily available \nthan transcriptomic or proteomic datasets.\nDespite the above challenges, examples of EA tools for metab-\nolomics that examine query metabolite profiles for evidence of \nsignificantly coordinated responses of biologically meaningful \nmetabolite sets stored in a database have begun to appear in \nrecent years. For example, Xia and Wishart (2010, 2011a) have \ndeveloped a web-application named metabolite set enrichment \nanalysis (MSEA) which uses the “globaltest” algorithm, originally \nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 1063\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\ndesigned for transcriptomic EA (Goeman et al., 2004), to provide \ntwo types of EA for metabolomics:\n 1.\n O\nver-representation analysis (ORA, Class I EA) that checks \nwhether any predefined metabolite sets (e.g., metabolites \nfrom certain metabolic pathways, from certain locations or \nwith certain disease associations) are enriched in a query \nmetabolite set.\n 2.\n Q\nuantitative Enrichment Analysis (QEA, Class II EA) in \nwhich metabolite concentration profiles for a number of \nsubjects differing in some continuous or discrete experi-\nmental factor of interest (e.g., drug dose) are provided as \ninput and the “globaltest” algorithm is used to test whether \nany of the predefined metabolite sets are significantly dif-\nferentially expressed as a group.\nMore recently, Xia and Wishart integrated their “globaltest” \nbased MSEA implementation into their powerful MetaboAnalyst \nmetabolomics data analysis web application (Xia and Wishart, \n2011b) while Persicke et al. (2012) integrated an MSEA feature \nbased on the original GSEA statistical approach (Subramanian \net al., 2005) into their versatile MeltDB metabolomics data pro-\ncessing pipeline (Persicke et al., 2012).\nWhile statistical methods are obviously important, the results \nof any EA tool can only be as meaningful as the transcript/protein/\nmetabolite sets defined in its database. It is therefore unfortunate \nthat creation of meaningful sets is so labor intensive. The deri-\nvation of metabolite sets from online pathway databases, while \namenable to scripting, still requires manual curation, especially \nwhen the pathway database itself has not been extensively curated \nor was not made specifically for the organism being studied \n(Persicke et  al., 2012). Even more laborious is the creation of \nmetabolite sets from information scattered across the literature in \na multitude of formats (Xia and Wishart, 2010). This may explain \nwhy most EA tools only provide built-in reference sets for one \ntaxonomic group or interest area.\nIn this article, we describe the design and validation of \nMetabolomeExpress PhenoMeter  –  a new tool for detecting \nbiologically meaningful patterns within metabolite response \nprofiles. The PhenoMeter (PM) differs from metabolomics EA \ntools in the following ways:\n 1.\n I\nt is not concerned with enrichments of metabolite sets but \nwith statistical similarities between experimentally observed \nmetabolic phenotypes.\n 2.\n R\nather than using a dedicated database as its source of \nreference data, it utilizes the MetabolomeExpress Metabolic \nPhenotype Database, MetaPhen (Carroll et al., 2010) – an \nestablished organism–  and technology-neutral public \nmetabolomics data repository providing persistent public \nstorage of experimental metabolic phenotypes  –  thereby \ndistributing the workload of producing reference data \nacross the metabolomics community.\n 3.\n F\nor both query input and reference phenotypes, it requires \nonly the fold changes of metabolite levels under a treatment \nrelative to a control rather than raw measurements. This \nmakes it possible to analyze metabolite data from the many \npublications that do not provide raw measurements while \nmaking the setup of PM queries simpler.\nAdditional features include:\n 1.\n M\netabolite label permutation-based estimation of hit \nsignificance.\n 2.\n I\nnteractive annotated scatterplots of phenotype–phenotype \ncomparisons.\n 3.\n N\network graph visualization of phenotype–phenotype \nsimilarity networks.\n 4.\n S\ntandardized and documented database import text-file \nformat for public submissions of experimental reference \ndatasets.\nWe begin by comparing the performance of four different phe-\nnotypic similarity scoring methods in correctly matching the met-\nabolic phenotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana metabolism mutants to \nreference phenotypes of functionally equivalent mutants affected \nin the same enzymes by independent mutations. To test the capac-\nity of the different methods to correctly discriminate between \nsimilar phenotypes, we used mutants affected in various steps of \na metabolic pathway rather than a set of functionally less related \nmutants. This pathway was photorespiration  –  a complex, high \nflux pathway that detoxifies and recycles 2-phosphoglycolate, a \ntoxic metabolite produced by Rubisco (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate \nCarboxylase/Oxygenase) – the enzyme responsible for fixing CO\n2 \nduring \n p\nhotosynthesis – when it fixes O2 instead of CO2 through \na competing reaction (Bauwe et  al., 2010, 2012; Maurino and \nPeterhansel, 2010).\nAfter demonstrating the high performance of the adopted \nscoring method, we describe the permutation-based approach \nused for significance testing and show that results of typical que-\nries are returned in practical timeframes. We then demonstrate \nfeatures for visualizing phenotypic similarity networks and show \nthat metabolic phenotypes of photorespiration mutants previ-\nously published by independent groups could be matched to the \nrelevant reference phenotypes from this study despite differences \nin growth conditions and analytical technologies. Finally, we \npresent examples of matching between metabolic responses to \na variety of different perturbations besides photorespiratory \ngene mutation using datasets from the publications of various \ngroups. The PM and tools like it promise to enhance the objec-\ntive interpretation of metabolic phenotypes by the metabolomics \ncommunity. The PM and associated documentation is publicly \navailable without registration at the MetabolomeExpress (Carroll \net al., 2010) website.\n2\nResults\nDevelopment of the phenoMeter phenotypic \nSimilarity Scoring Algorithm\nThe PM accepts metabolic phenotypes (sets of metabolite fold \nchanges in a treatment relative to a control) as queries and \n2 https://www.metabolome-express.org/phenometer.php\nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 1064\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\nsearches a database for phenotypes that are statistically signifi-\ncantly similar (or inverse). The metabolic phenotype database, \nMetaPhen, is part of MetabolomeExpress public metabolomics \ndatabase ( Carroll et  al., 2010). At the time of publication, \nMetaPhen contained 429 publicly available phenotypes from \n50 peer-reviewed publications spanning 17 organisms and 15 \nanalytical technologies. Thus, despite being biased toward the \nplant kingdom, the MetaPhen database is currently compara-\nble in size and scope to other major metabolomics databases \nsuch as the United States Government National Institute of \nHealth (NIH) Metabolomics Workbench\n3 and the European \nBioinformatics Institute’s MetaboLights (Haug et  al., 2013) \ndatabases that contained data from 64 and 85 studies, respec-\ntively. Query phenotypes may be selected from those already in \nMetaPhen or pasted into the web interface as a list of metabolites \nand their fold changes (or log transformations thereof). For \nuser phenotypes, metabolite identifiers are recognized by first \nparsing them to remove chemical derivative or library-specific \ninformation and then mapping them to compound-specific \nIUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) codes via a \nlarge database table mapping approximately 200,000 metabo-\nlite synonyms to over 8000 distinct metabolites. Most common \nmetabolites will be recognized if a reasonably common name \nis used.\nThe primary dataset used to test the performance of candidate \nhit ranking statistics was a set of metabolic phenotypes obtained \nvia untargeted GC/MS metabolomic analysis of polar leaf extracts \nof 26 A. thaliana  metabolism mutants grown under a standard \nset of conditions. Thirteen of these (see Materials and Methods) \nhad been previously characterized by others and shown to be \nimpaired in enzymes of the photorespiration metabolic pathway \n(Figure  1). Our collection of known photorespiration mutants \nwill hereon be referred to as the “reference mutants” . The remain-\ning 13 metabolic phenotypes used in our performance test were \nof mutants isolated from an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-\nmutagenized A. thaliana  mutant population via a chlorophyll \nfluorescence-based forward genetic screen designed to detect \nphotorespiration mutants (Badger et al., 2009).\nPrior to this study, the new putative photorespiration mutants \nhad not been characterized at the metabolic or genetic levels. \nHowever, it was expected that a high proportion of the new mutants \nwould be impaired in the same metabolic enzyme as one or more \nof the reference mutants and therefore exhibit significantly simi-\nlar metabolic phenotypes to those mutants. The rationale behind \nour performance test was that, after searching each of the new \nputative photorespiration mutant metabolic phenotypes against \nthe reference phenotypes, the biochemical lesion indicated by \nthe top match could be confirmed as correct or otherwise by the \npresence or absence of a mutation in the expected gene by next \ngeneration sequencing (NGS) or, if necessary, by the presence or \nabsence of protein or enzymatic activity. Counting the percent-\nage of correct top hits would then provide an assessment of each \nmethod’s performance. Below, we compare the performance of \neach ranking approach (see Table 1 for results).\n3 http://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/\ncandidate hit Ranking Statistic 1: R2\nThe first approach we tested was to simply rank hits according to \nR\n2 where R is the Pearson correlation coefficient between X and \nY: equivalent equal length vectors representing the bait and prey \nmetabolic phenotypes as treatment/control signal intensity ratios \n(SIRs or “fold-changes”) of the metabolites, transformed into so \ncalled “ResponseValues” (RVs) as follows:\n \nWhere SIR RV SIR1\nWhere SIR RV 11 SIR\nWhere SIR\n>= −\n<= − ()\n=\n1\n1\n1\n:\n:/\n:  RV = 0  \nThi\ns transformation is similar to a log transformation in that \nit centers the data about 0 with increases, decreases, and non-\nresponses being represented as positive, negative, and 0 values, \nrespectively. However, unlike a log transformation, the RV trans-\nformation places the fold changes on a linear scale rather than a log \nscale and therefore does not down-weight stronger changes the way \nlog transformation does. In all tests, a filter was applied to remove \nall metabolites with an absolute fold-change <1.5 (that is, a fold \nchange between 1.5 and 1/1.5). This was to remove the influence of \nmetabolites with marginal fold changes of questionable biological \nsignificance. Users may adjust this setting to suit their data.\nThis approach performed reasonably well in that, in 12 (92%) \nof 13 cases, the metabolic lesion indicated by the top match was \nconfirmed either by the detection (by whole genome resequenc-\ning, see Materials and Methods) of a high-confidence and severe \nnon-synonymous mutation in a conserved protein-coding region \nof the same gene as that affected in the top-matched reference \nmutant, or, in one case, by the detection of severe depletion of \nthe relevant protein (Table  1). A single mismatch was obtained \nfor the mutant, 17-10F4, that was matched to the chloroplast \ndicarboxylate transporter 2 (DIT2.1)-deficient reference mutant, \ndct (Somerville and Ogren, 1983). However, the genome re-\nsequencing-based detection of a high confidence mutation in the \nGLU1 gene of 17-10F4 predicted a G1252E residue change in a \nconserved part of the GLU1 protein, thereby strongly supporting \nGLU1-deficient as the correct assignment (Table  1; Table S1 in \nSupplementary Material).\nThe enzymes, DIT2.1 and GLU1, are closely functionally con-\nnected (Figure 1) and the strongest metabolic changes observed \nin the DIT2.1- and GLU1-deficient reference mutants were simi-\nlar (for example, 14- to 52-fold decreases in glutamate, \n a\nspartate, \nand serine and 4- to 14-fold increases in 2-\n o\nxoglutarate).  \nIt is therefore not surprising that the R2 approach did not correctly \nresolve these phenotypes in every case, since R2 was strongly influ-\nenced by these larger fold changes. This sensitivity to larger fold \nchanges raised concern that, by using R\n2 alone, useful discrimina-\ntory information contained within large numbers of small but \nnonetheless biologically meaningful metabolite responses could \nbe effectively ignored if a relatively small number of metabolites \nchanged strongly in similar ways in the query and reference \nphenotypes. Moreover, the R\n2 method would be prone to giving \nfalse negatives in instances where even a small number of large \nspurious metabolite responses are reported erroneously due to \nsome overlooked technical issue (e.g., chemical contamination \nor peak integration error).\nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 1065\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\ncandidate hit Ranking Statistic 2:  \nBiweight Midcorr\nelation\nOur concerns about the sensitivity of the R2 method to outliers and \nlarge fold changes led us to test the bicor function of the weighted \ncorrelation network analysis (WGCNA) R package (Langfelder and \nHorvath, 2008) as a potential alternative. This function performs a \nform of “robust” correlation known as “biweight midcorrelation” \nthat is less sensitive to outliers than Pearson Correlation and has \nbeen used widely to measure similarity between gene expression \nprofiles for the purposes of constructing gene co-expression \nnetworks (Langfelder and Horvath, 2012). Replacing R\n2 with the \nrobust correlation coefficient calculated by the bicor function did \nindeed result in the previously mismatched phenotype of 17-10F4 \nbeing correctly top-matched to a GLU1-deficient reference mutant \nrather than the DIT2.1-deficient mutant (as observed using R\n2, see \nabove). However, the appearance of a number of new mismatches \nbrought the success rate of this approach down to only 10 (77%) \nout of 13 (Table  1) suggesting a decrease in overall performance \nrelative to the R\n2 and hence that down-weighting of higher fold \nchanges with larger absolute deviations did not enhance discrimi-\nnation. This method was therefore not tested further and will be \nreferred to as the “BWMC” method.

To this end, we \ntried ranking phenotypic similarities according to the “qualita-\ntive overlap” of the two metabolic phenotypes as determined by \ncounting: (a) the number of metabolites that are increased in both \nphenotypes; (b) the number of metabolites that are decreased in \nboth phenotypes; (c) the number of metabolites that are increased \nin the query but decreased in the reference; and (d) the number \nof metabolites that are decreased in the query but increased in the \nreference; and using these as input into a two-tailed Fisher’s Exact \nTest (Fisher, 1922). The p-value obtained by this method will be \nreferred to as “FET2p. ”\nRanking hits in order of FET2p resulted in 10 (77%) of the \n13 mutants being correctly top-matched (Table  1 ). Using this \nmethod eliminated the mismatching of the new shm1  mutant \n18-21E7 to the cat-2 reference that was observed using the R\n2 and \nBWMC methods and mismatches of the new gls (GLU1-impaired) \nmutants, 17-10F4 and 24-27C2, to the dct  reference as observed \nusing R\n2 and BWMC, respectively. This suggested that qualita-\ntive (directional) aspects these metabolic phenotypes, exposed \nby removing the contribution of fold change magnitudes to the \nranking, contained important discriminatory information not suf-\nficiently captured by R\n2 or BWMC. The FET2p method, however, \nproduced new mismatches for two mutants identified by genome \nresequencing as defective in peroxisomal serine/alanine: glyoxy-\nlate aminotransferase 1 (AGT1) on the basis of severe mutations in \nthe AGT1 gene (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). One of these \n(30-2A7) was mismatched to the pmdh1pmdh2 reference mutant \nimpaired in peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase (pMDH) activity \nmetabolically closely connected to AGT1 in the peroxisome. The \nother (32-34C7) was mismatched to the glyk  reference mutant \ndefective in the plastidic enzyme, glycerate kinase (GLYK), which \nfunctions just downstream of AGT1 in the photorespiratory path-\nway. Importantly, these mutants were both correctly top-matched \nto AGT1-deficient reference phenotypes using the R\n2 method \n(Table 1), suggesting that metabolite fold changes contained infor-\nmation necessary to discriminate the qualitatively similar AGT1-, \npMDH-, and GLYK-deficient phenotypes. Another mutant (17-\n6E4) correctly matched to GLU1-deficient gls reference mutants \nusing R\n2 and BWMC and confirmed to be deficient in GLU1 pro-\ntein by western blotting (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material), \nwas mismatched to dct using the FET2p method.\ncandidate Ranking Statistic 4: \nR2 × (−log10(FeT2p))\nThe fact that that the R 2 and FET2p methods yielded comple-\nmentary sets of correct top matches suggested that they were \nsensitive to complementary types of functional discrimina-\ntory information within metabolic phenotypes. Based on this \nobservation, we hypothesized that a hybrid scoring function \nallowing both metrics to contribute to rankings might outper -\nform either metric alone. We therefore tested the ability of the \nformula R\n2 × (−log10(FET2p)) to yield correct top matches for the \n13 mutants.

The procedure for \ncalculating the PhenoMeter similarity scor\ne consists of several stages. First, \nmetabolites that are not represented or do not increase or decrease by at \nleast the minimum threshold (1.5-fold by default) in both bait and prey are \ndiscarded. Then, signal intensity ratios (SIRs) associated with each metabolite \nare transformed to ResponseValues (RV = SIR–1 where SIR > 1 and \nRV = (−1/SIR) + 1 where SIR <1). The correlation between the RVs of the \nbait and prey phenotypes is then calculated. The PhenoMeter then counts \nthe number of metabolites that are (1) increased above threshold in both \nphenotypes; (2) decreased below threshold in both phenotypes; (3) \ndecreased below threshold in the bait but increased above threshold in the \nreference; and (4) increased above threshold in bait but decreased below \nthreshold in reference; and then uses these values as input into a two-tailed \nFisher’s Exact Test to calculate the statistical significance of the qualitative \noverlap of the two phenotypes (FET2p). The PM score is then calculated \nusing the formula PM score = sgn(R)*R\n2*(–log10(FET2p)).\nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 1067\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\nformula by multiplying it by sgn(R) so that the sign of the score \nwould be the same as the sign of the correlation between the \nquery and reference phenotypes (sgn is a mathematical function \nthat extracts the sign of its parameter by outputting −1 when it is \nnegative, +1 when it is positive and 0 when it is equal to 0):\n =× ×−RRPhenoMeterScores gn( )( log( FET2p))2\n10  \nW\nhile simply replacing R 2 with R would have achieved the \nsame sign-changing effect, we observed lower matching per -\nformance when R2 was replaced with R (data not shown due to \nlimited space). The fact that the magnitude of the PM score is \nderived from two readily understood statistics (R\n2 and FET2p) \nmakes its “strength” readily interpretable in familiar statistical \nterms. For example, the fact that a match with a marginally sig-\nnificant FET2p of 0.05 and an R\n2 of 0.8 (an above average R 2 for \ngenuine matches between functionally equivalent phenotypes; \nsee Table 2) would have a PM score of ~1 (1.040824) makes this \nscore a useful benchmark since scores <1 must either have low \nR\n2 or insignificant FET2p while scores >>1 must at least have a \nhighly significant FET2p if not a high R 2 as well. Thus, as a “rule \nof thumb, ” scores <1 may be considered ‘weak’ while scores >>1 \nmay be considered “strong. ” An example PM score calculation is \nillustrated in Figure 2.\npermutation-Based estimation of  \nStatistical Significance: \npnon-bio\nAn important issue associated with the use of pattern matching \ntools employing custom scoring methods is that of assessing statis-\ntical significance. An intuitive way of assessing the significance of a \nhit with a particular score is to estimate the probability of it arising \nby chance from a query that is the same in every way except that \nthe associations between fold-change values and metabolite labels \nhave been randomized to destroy the biological meaningfulness \nof the query pattern. After all, under the null hypothesis that the \nquery was biologically meaningless, shuffling the metabolite labels \nshould have no significant effect on the magnitude of the returned \nscore. Thus, adopting the traditional alpha cut-off of 0.05, we \nmay consider a significant hit as one with a score expected to be \nexceeded in magnitude in fewer than 5% of cases when metabolite \nshuffling and searching is repeated many times.\nTheoretically, the probability of obtaining a given score after \nmetabolite labels have been reshuffled is sensitive to a variety of \nsearch parameters:\n 1.\n Th\ne size of the search space. The larger the number of \nreference phenotypes in the search space, the greater the \nprobability of getting at least one high score by chance.\n 2.\n Th\ne number of metabolites in the query. As the number of \nmetabolites compared is increased, the lowest achievable \nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 1068\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\np-value from the Fisher’s Exact Test is decreased (and the \npotential magnitude of the PM score increased).\n 3.\n Th\ne identities of metabolites in the query. Some metabolites \ntend to be more biologically responsive than others and thus \nhave greater potential to contribute to higher R\n2 values.\n 4.\n Th\ne distribution of fold changes in the query (and hence \nalso the fold-change filter threshold setting) could affect the \ncapacity to achieve high R\n2 values.\nThe approach used to estimate the probability of a hit with \na given score being a false positive under the null hypothesis is \nshown in Figure 3. Each search begins by generating 30 permu-\ntations of the original query in which the metabolite labels are \nrandomly shuffled. These are then searched against the chosen \nreference phenotype set in exactly the same way as the original \nquery. The null score distribution is then modeled as a normal \ndistribution from the mean and SD of all the scores returned by \nthe permutated phenotypes (the total number of “null” scores \nbeing equal to 30 times the number of phenotypes in the search \nspace).\nTo establish that a normal distribution was a reasonable \nmodel of the typical null score distribution, we permuted the \nphenotype of five different mutants 500 times each, prepared \nhistograms of the resulting null PM hit scores and overlaid \nthem with plots of the normal distribution modeled from the \nmeans and SDs of the null scores (see Figure 4 for a repre-\nsentative example). These results clearly established that the \nnormal distribution was in fact a conservative model of the \nempirical null distribution. Conveniently, this made it appro-\npriate to use the common z -statistic to estimate the percentage \nof random permutations that would be expected to exceed any \ngiven score:\n \nHit score PM Score- PM_Scoreactual perm\nperm scores\nz − σ= _\n \nw\nhere PM_Score actual  is the score of the original unshuf-\nfled phenotype match and PM_Scoreperm  and σperm scores  are the \nmean and SD of the PM scores returned from the permuted \nqueries, respectively.\nThe p-value derived through the above approach treats the \nfold changes of different metabolites as independent observa-\ntions. For the purposes of testing the null hypothesis defined \nearlier, this assumption of independence is appropriate given \nthat different metabolites are generally detected as independ-\nent instrument signals whose magnitudes bear no significant \ninfluence on one another and should exhibit no significant \ncorrelations attributable to systematic technical variation pro-\nvided that effective steps were taken to avoid such systematic \ntechnical variation (e.g., block randomization of analytical batch \nsequences). Thus, as long as the above technical requirements \nare met, this p -value can be interpreted as an estimate of the \nprobability that the observed match score did not  emerge out of \nbiology. We therefore refer to this value as p\nnon-bio. It is important \nto note that the biological non-independence of metabolites \nwhich arises from metabolic network structure is not relevant to \nthe hypothesis outlined above.\nSpeed performance\nFor phenotypic similarity searches to become a practical part \nof daily operations, results need to be returned within seconds \nor minutes rather than hours or days. Computational efficiency \nwas therefore another factor behind the decision to use simple \nstatistics as the basis of phenotypic similarity measurement. To \nevaluate speed performance of the PM, we ran some different \nkinds of searches and recorded the completion times (Table  3 ). \nFrom these results, it can be seen that search times associated with \ntypical usage cases range from under 2 s for simple searches with \nless than 100 metabolites to 10 min for more complex searches \nincluding thousands of metabolite signals.\nVisualization of phenotypic Similarity networks\nIn the validation experiments described earlier, we observed \nthat A. thaliana mutants affected in different but functionally \nconnected enzymes displayed similar metabolic phenotypes. \nIndeed, the mirroring of gene–gene functional connections in \nphenotype–phenotype similarities has also been observed in \nyeast (Fraser and Plotkin, 2007; McGary et al., 2007), nematodes \n(Lee et  al., 2008), and plants (Messerli et  al., 2007; Fukushima \net  al., 2014). The observation that human diseases associated \nwith similar phenotypes are frequently mediated by genes that \nare connected via functional modules such as pathways or \n p\nrotein–protein interaction networks (Lage et al., 2007) has led \nto the concept of the “modular nature of human genetic disease” \n(Oti et  al., 2008). This correlation between functional genetic \nrelationships and phenotypic relationships has been exploited \nsuccessfully in the prediction of the disease-causing roles of genes \nfrom functional genomics data (Wu et al., 2008).\nThe PM provides an opportunity to explore the structures \nof metabolic phenotypic similarity networks and obtain insight \ninto the functional interaction networks that underlie them. \nTo this end, we incorporated network graph visualization of \nmetabolic phenotypic similarity networks into the PM. As a \ndemonstration, we generated a network graph of the metabolic \nphenotypes of the A. thaliana  photorespiration mutants used \nto develop the PM similarity scoring method. We then colored \nthe nodes according to pathway function to visually explore \nwhether network modules reflected metabolic functional mod-\nules (Figure 5). Mutants affected in Fd-GOGAT (GLU1) were \nco-located (in the upper left of the graph) with the dct mutant \ndefective in the closely functionally connected dicarboxylate \ntransporter (DiT2.1). This cluster was highly interconnected \nwith another cluster (lower left) made up of mutants affected in \ntwo other closely metabolically linked enzymes: glycine decar -\nboxylase (GDC) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). \nThis interconnection reflects the shared involvement of GLU1, \nDiT2.1, GDC, and SHMT in the photorespiratory nitrogen cycle \n(Figure 1). To the bottom center of the graph was a cluster made \nup of mutants affected in enzymes hydroxypyruvate reductase \n(HPR), pMDH, and GLYK that function together in pathway \nconverting hydroxypyruvate to 3-phosphoglycerate. Consistent \nwith the notion that phenotypic similarity networks reflect \nfunctional networks, the agt1 mutants affected in AGT1  –  an \nenzyme that links HPR to the photorespiratory nitrogen cycle \nthrough the transamination of glyoxylate using serine as an \nFIgURe 3 | estimation of statistical significance via permutation \ntesting.\n The probability of obtaining a given PhenoMeter score by chance is \ndependent upon algorithm settings and the nature of the bait and reference \nphenotype search space. To estimate the chance of obtaining the reported \nscore by chance, each bait search is therefore accompanied by a permutation \ntest in which random permutations of the bait phenotype are searched in an \notherwise identical manner. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the \nscores from these searches is then used to calculate a z-score for the actual \nscore from which a p-value is estimated. We call this p-value p\nnon-bio because it \nrepresents the probability of the match score not having arisen out of biology.\nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 1069\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\namino donor  –  were connected with both the HPR/pMDH/\nGLYK cluster and the cluster made up of mutants affected in \nthe photorespiratory nitrogen recycling enzymes GLU1, DiT2.1, \nGDC, and SHMT.\ncross-Study Metabolic phenotype Matching\nTo investigate the potential for cross-study phenotype matching \nwith the PM, we tested whether independently published meta-\nbolic phenotypes for various photorespiration mutants transferred \nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 10610\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\nfrom non-photorespiratory high CO2 to photorespiratory air con-\nditions for various durations against our reference set (Table  4). \nWe first tested whether the phenotypes of mutants impaired in \nmitochondrial glycine to serine conversion could be correctly \ntop-matched to our reference shm1  and mtkas-1 photorespira-\ntion mutants impaired in the same process. These mutants exhibit \nstrong metabolic phenotypes and their comparison in the same \nspecies therefore represents a best-case scenario for achieving \nsignificant matches. Indeed, phenotypes reported for shm1  by \nCollakova et al. (2008) and Eisenhut et al. (2013) both returned \nsignificant top matches to either our shm1  or mtkas-1 reference \ndespite considerable differences in air treatment time (Table  4). \nSimilar results were obtained (Table 4) for the phenotypes of other \nmutants affected glycine-to-serine conversion – namely the purU \nmutant defective in 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate (THF) deform-\nylase activity required to prevent accumulation of 5-formyl-THF \nthat potently inhibits GDC/SHMT activity in the mitochondrial \nmatrix (Collakova et al., 2008) and the bou-2 mutant defective \nin the putative mitochondrial glycine transporter, A BOUT DE \nSOUFFLE, presumably required to transport glycine into mito-\nchondria so it can be converted into serine (Eisenhut et al., 2013).\nWe next tried searching phenotypes reported for Ljgs2-2, a \nLotus japonicus photorespiration mutant affected in plastidic \nglutamine synthetase (GS) (Pérez-Delgado et  al., 2013). These \nphenotypes were strong but our reference set did not include \nany A. thaliana or L. japonicas GS mutants so we wanted to test \nwhether the phenotypes of Ljgs2-2 had enough similarity to our \nreference phenotypes to yield hits consistent with its photorespi-\nratory impairment. Indeed, significant matches to our reference \nphenotypes were returned, the highest scoring ones being to \nshm1 and pmdh1pmdh2 (Table 4). Moreover, an unbiased search \nof the entire database, which contains hundreds of phenotypes \nbesides those of photorespiration mutants, returned a set of 27 \nsignificant hits of which 19 (70%), including the top two (p\nnon-\nbio = 4E−281 and 7E−81), were associated with photorespiration \nmutants despite photorespiration mutant phenotypes comprising \nonly 4% of the phenotypes in the database.\nAs a further challenge, we tried searching phenotypes reported \nfor hpr1 and pglp1 (Timm et al., 2012). The hpr1 mutant affected \nin peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reductase 1 (HPR1) and a num-\nber of phenotypically similar pmdh  mutants affected in one of \nits metabolic partner enzymes, pMDH, were represented in our \nreference set. However, the metabolic phenotype of hpr1 is mild \nand reportedly quite dependent on the length of time exposed to \nair (Timm et al., 2012), suggesting that technical noise and the \ninfluences of experimental differences might preclude matching. \nNonetheless, hpr1 phenotypes recorded after 1, 3, and 5 days of \nair treatment gave significant hits to shm1 , pmdh2, and pmdh2, \nrespectively, albeit with low scores (Table 4). Given the functional \nand phenotypic relatedness of hpr1 and pmdh mutants, it is not \nsurprising that hpr1  was mismatched to pmdh2 . The mismatch \nto shm1 over hpr1 or pmdh  references was more surprising but \nnonetheless significant.\nOur reference set did not include any reference phenotypes \nfor phosphoglycolate phosphatase mutants. However, the phe-\nnotypes reported for pglp1 exposed to air for 1, 3, and 5  days \ngave significant matches to pmdh2, hpr1, and pmdh2 with p\nnon-bio \nvalues of 3.5E− 3, 5E− 21, and 6E− 25, respectively (Table  4 ). \nSearching the five-day phenotype against the entire database \nconfirmed that pmdh2  and hpr1  were still returned as the two \nmost significant hits.\nexamples of Matching Responses to non-\np\nhotorespiratory \ng\nenetic \np\nerturbations\nThe PM approach is not only applicable to phenotypes of \nphotorespiratory mutants but also to all kinds of metabolic \nresponses. To demonstrate this, we tested whether searching \nthe metabolic phenotypes of mutants affected in genes outside \nthe photorespiration pathway would also return hits to func-\ntionally related mutants (Table  5). First, we searched the entire \nFIgURe 4 | null score distribution associated with 500 permutations \nof a typical query\n. To establish that the normal distribution was an \nappropriate model of the typical null score distribution, a histogram of scores \nobtained from 500 permutations of a typical query phenotype was prepared \nand overlaid with a plot of the normal distribution calculated from the mean \nand SD of scores. This clearly shows that the normal distribution is a \nconservative model of the null score distribution. Essentially identical results \nwere obtained from permutations of four other metabolic phenotypes.\nTABle 3 | completion times associated with typical phenoMeter usage cases.\nDescription n umber of query \nphenotypes\nn umber of reference \nphenotypes\nUnknown metabolites \nincluded (\ny\n|\nn\n)\nc ompletion \ntime (s)\nSearch phenotype against target reference phenotypes for classification 1 14 N 1.9\nSearch phenotype against target reference phenotypes for classification 1 14 Y 3.7\nUntargeted search of single phenotype against entire database for  \nnon-biased annotation\n1 442 Y 35\nSearch phenotypes against themselves to construct a similarity network 36 36 N 304\nSearch phenotypes against themselves to construct a similarity network 36 36 Y 589\nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 10611\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\ndatabase using the metabolic phenotype of the A. thaliana alx8  \nmutant – an EMS mutant in a Col-0 ecotype background that \nharbors a loss-of-function mutation in the gene, At5g63980, \nencoding the bi-functional SAL1/FRY1/RON1 nucleotidase/\nphosphatase shown to be a negative regulator of abiotic stress \ndefense responses linked to chloroplast retrograde signaling \n(Wilson et  al., 2009; Estavillo et  al., 2011).

However, \nthe PM approach could also be used to detect functional links \nbetween metabolic responses to other forms of perturbation such \nas environmental or biochemical perturbation. To demonstrate \nthis, we searched metabolic responses to such perturbations \nagainst the database in cases where responses to functionally \nsimilar perturbations were present in the database (Table 6).\nThe first response we searched was that of A. thaliana cells to \n16 h of treatment with rotenone – a pharmacological inhibitor \nof mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I (Garmier \net al., 2008). The top hit (PM score = 6.7) was to the response of \nthe same cells to the same treatment for 12 h (the previous time \npoint in the same rotenone treatment time course). Similarly, \nthe top hit (PM score  =  12.5) to the response of germinating \nOryza sativa (rice) seedlings to 24 h of anaerobic treatment after \n24  h of aerobic germination (relative to a constitutive aerobic \ngermination control) was the response of rice seedlings to 48 h \nof constitutive anaerobic germination (relative to an aerobically \ngerminated control).\nTo demonstrate that such matching between related responses \nwas possible for responses reported by other authors and for \nresponses to treatments other than respiratory perturbation, \nwe also searched the responses of Lotus japonicus to salt stress \n(Sanchez et  al., 2008) and A. thaliana  to sulfur deficiency \n(Nikiforova et al., 2005) and cold stress (Kaplan et al., 2004), and \nheat stress (Kaplan et al., 2004). In each case, the top hit was to the \nresponse recorded for the same treatment for a different duration \nor dosage in the same time course or dosage series (Table 6).\nAs an additional validation, we constructed a network from \nthe metabolic responses of A. thaliana plants to various durations \nof 4°C cold stress (1, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h) and 40°C heat stress \n(5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min) previously reported by Kaplan \net al. (2004) in a time course metabolomic study (Figure S2 in \nSupplementary Material). Nodes corresponding to cold stress \nresponses formed a tightly connected cluster that was, in turn, \nloosely connected to a more sparsely connected cluster cor -\nresponding to the heat stress responses. Within each cluster, the \nstrengths of PM scores between nodes reflected the temporal \norder of the associated time course. That is, beginning from the \nearliest time-point, following the pathway of highest PM scores \nfrom node to node (without backtracking) correctly traced out \nthe temporal pathway from the start to the end of the relevant \ntime course. This confirms that the metabolic responses of A. \nthaliana to the temperature stresses follow orderly progressions \nthrough time [as originally demonstrated by Kaplan et al. (2004)] \nand that this progression is accurately reflected in PM statistical \nresults.\nCombined, the above results confirm that the PM approach \nis generally applicable to genetically-, biochemically- and envi-\nronmentally induced metabolic responses and that the supple-\nmentary metabolomics data tables provided with even relatively \nold studies contain sufficient statistical information for detecting \nfunctional links between such responses.\nDiscussion\nBiological pathway Mutants are Useful for \nBenchmarking \np\nhenotype Matching Tools\nIn this study, we used a set of A. thaliana  mutants affected in \nvarious steps of the photorespiration metabolic pathway as a tool \nto test the performance of different similarity scoring methods. \nGenetic mutants are particularly suitable for this purpose because \nthe nature of their perturbation may be determined or targeted \nvery precisely and they are readily available to the community. \nThis contrasts with other perturbations such as pharmacological \nenzyme inhibitors, for example, that can have unknown off-\ntarget effects (undesired or unknown inhibitions of non-target \nenzymes) even when they nominally hit the same target.\nTheoretically, two mutants with loss-of-function mutations in \nthe same gene in the same genetic background should display \nessentially the same phenotype and any residual differences \nin phenotype should represent technical noise (including \nTABle 6 | Matching metabolic responses to functionally linked chemical and environmental perturbations.\nQuery Top hit p M score Functional link\nResponse of A. thaliana cells to 16 h of respiratory \ninhibition with rotenone (Garmier et al., 2008)\nResponse of A. thaliana cells to 12 h of respiratory \ninhibition with rotenone (Garmier et al., 2008)\n6.7 Same treatment for different durations\nResponse of germinating Oryza sativa seedlings \nto 24 h of anoxic treatment after 24 h of aerobic \ngermination (Narsai et al., 2009)\nResponse of germinating Oryza sativa seedlings \nto 48 h of constitutive anoxic germination (Narsai \net al., 2009)\n12.5 Same treatment for different durations and \nat slightly different developmental stages\nResponse of L. japonicus shoots to 150 mM NaCl \nstress (Sanchez et al., 2008)\nResponse of L. japonicus shoots to 100 mM NaCl \nstress (Sanchez et al., 2008)\n9.6 Same treatment with different doses and \ndurations\nResponse of A. thaliana seedlings to 13 days of \ngermination under constitutive sulfur deficiency \n(Nikiforova et al., 2005)\nResponse of A. thaliana seedlings to 10 days of \ngermination under constitutive sulfur deficiency \n(Nikiforova et al., 2005)\n1.8 Same treatment for different durations\nResponse of A. thaliana seedlings to 24 h of cold \nstress (Kaplan et al., 2004)\nResponse of A. thaliana seedlings to 48 h of cold \nstress (Kaplan et al., 2004)\n12.9 Same treatment for different durations\nResponse of A. thaliana seedlings to 120 min of heat \nstress (Kaplan et al., 2004)\nResponse of A. thaliana seedlings to 60 min of \nheat stress (Kaplan et al., 2004)\n1.92 Same treatment for different durations\nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 10614\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\nunavoidable biological effects caused by imperfect replication of \nexperimental design and starting biological state of germplasm). \nThus, assuming that there are no significant technical errors \nwithin the data, the ideal phenotype matching tool should score \nmatches between such functionally equivalent mutants above \nmatches between functionally non-equivalent mutants. This \nshould be facile if the mutant pairs to be discriminated are func-\ntionally unrelated. However, when the mutant pairs represent \nsteps in common biological pathway, the task of maintaining \ncorrect matches by correctly discriminating between responses \nto functionally related perturbations becomes more challenging.\nIn this study, a demonstration of the challenge of resolving the \nphenotypes associated with functionally related perturbations was \nthe frequent failure to correctly discriminate between phenotypes \nof mtkas and shm1 mutants (Table 1). Despite carrying mutations \nin different genes and being directly affected in different enzymes, \nmtkas and shm1  mutants have essentially identical metabolic \nphenotypes because the enzymes they are affected in (GDC and \nSHMT, respectively) cooperate in the conversion of glycine to \nserine in reactions that are tightly coupled via a common pool of \nTHFs in the mitochondrial matrix (Prabhu et al., 1996).\nFurther evidence of pathway connections driving phenotypic \nsimilarities that challenge statistical discrimination was seen in \nthe mismatches of glu1 query mutants to the dct reference instead \nof glu1 references when R\n2 and BWMC were used as similarity \nmeasures (Table  1). The GLU1 and DiT2.1 enzymes affected in \nglu1 and dct  mutants are not as directly biochemically coupled \nas GDC and SHMT. However, DiT2.1 supports GLU1 by its \ninvolvement in the import of the 2-oxoglutarate consumed by \nGLU1 into the chloroplast and the export of the glutamate GLU1 \nproduces (Somerville and Ogren, 1983; Renné et al., 2003). Thus, \nimpairment of either enzyme will cause a similar disruption of \nphotorespiratory nitrogen recycling pathway and lead to similar \nresponses in the metabolome. Effective phenotypic matching \ntools should be as reliable as possible at discriminating between \nsimilar responses and we therefore recommend testing the ability \nto discriminate biological pathway mutants as a general approach \nto benchmarking phenotypic similarity scoring methods that aim \nto detect functional links.\nQuantitative correlation and Qualitative overlap: \nc\nomplementary Indicators\nQuantitative correlations are often used to assess similarities \nbetween molecular response profiles (Langfelder and Horvath, \n2012) while Fisher’s Exact Tests have been used widely to calculate \nthe significance of qualitative overlaps between gene sets (Huang \net al., 2009) so these were obvious starting points in our hunt for \nan effective similarity measure. We observed that R\n2 and FET2p \ngave different sets of mismatches in our performance test while \nthe hybrid PM score based on both parameters outperformed \neither parameter alone (Table  1). Significantly, this suggests that \nquantitative correlation and qualitative overlap are complemen-\ntary indicators of functional links between metabolic phenotypes \nand that statistical similarity measures that utilize both effectively \nwill likely outperform those that utilize only one.\nTo contribute to the FET2p term of the PM score, metabolites \nneed only be increased or decreased by more than the minimum \nfold-change threshold (1.5-fold by default) in both the query and \nreference; there is no requirement for statistical significance and \nno weighting according to fold-change. The FET2p term can \ntherefore be large in the absence of any strong or statistically \nsignificant metabolite responses, as long as the directions of the \nmetabolite responses overlap with the reference. Achieving a high \nR\n2 term does not depend on a query having strong or statistically \nsignificant responses either. Taken together, our observations \nhighlight the importance of publishing and sharing complete \nsets of metabolite responses, including small and statistically \ninsignificant changes, rather than only those responses that have a \nhigh fold change or low p-value. While individual non-significant \ntrends may seem unworthy of publication in themselves, collec-\ntively, they can contain crucial information.\nFacile cross-Study comparisons will Facilitate \nthe Discussion of Metabolomics Results\nWhen the sequences of new genes or proteins are reported in \nthe literature, it is standard practice to report and discuss some \nmeasure of their similarity (e.g., % identity) to already known \nsequences, as determined using a similarity search like BLAST \n(Altschul et  al., 1990). By contrast, with few exceptions (Fukushima \net al., 2014), when new metabolite responses are reported, com-\nparisons to previous results tend to be of a subjective and qualita-\ntive nature, comparing only selected features (e.g., “… authors Y \nalso observed an increase in metabolite X…”) and not providing \nan objective statistical measure of similarity. Metabolomics data-\nbases such as MetaboLights (Haug et  al., 2013), Metabolomics \nWorkbench, and MetabolomeExpress (Carroll et  al., 2010) \nalready contain sufficient volumes of metabolite response data \nto make PM-like searches a worthwhile and effective means of \nestablishing where newly observed metabolic phenotypes and \nresponses lay in the collective phenomic landscape. What features \ndo new observations have in common with previous ones? Are \nthere any features of a newly observed phenotype which distin-\nguish it from its nearest neighbors in phenotypic space? If a new \nmetabolite response is significantly similar to one or more entries \nin a public database, this match should be reported because it \nmay point to an underlying mechanistic functional link that may \notherwise escape detection. Conversely, if a new response bears \nno similarity to known responses, this is also worth reporting \nbecause it points to an under-explored type of response linked \nto an under-explored response mechanism just as a gene with \nno homology to known genes points to an under-explored new \nclass of genes.\nThe phenoMeter is Suited to large-Scale \nMetabolic \np\nhenotypic Forward Screening\nThe emergence of fast NGS-based bulk segregant analysis meth-\nods has dramatically reduced the time and effort involved in map-\nping causative mutations in mutants isolated by forward genetic \nscreens (Schneeberger et  al., 2009; Hartwig et  al., 2012). Thus, \nthese techniques increase the attractiveness of forward genetic \nscreening as a functional genomics gene discovery approach. \nForward screens have traditionally relied on visual phenotypic \nsignals such as a visible change in appearance or expression of a vis-\nible marker signal. However, high-throughput biochemical assays \nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 10615\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\nthat allow thousands of individuals to be assayed in practical time \nframes offer a powerful alternative approach to mine large mutant \npopulations for mutants affected in specific metabolic pathways. \nIn our speed performance tests, we showed that, using the PM, a \nsingle metabolic phenotype can be searched against 14 reference \nphenotypes, giving a reliable diagnosis of any of 14 metabolic \nlesions in less than 2 s. Thus, high-throughput robotic metabolite \nextractions combined with, for example, high-throughput direct \ninfusion MS (Koulman et al., 2007), automated data processing \nand PM diagnosis could potentially provide sufficient throughput \nto be used for metabolomics-based forward screening.\nchallenges and limitations of the  \np\nhenoMeter Approach\nWhile our results demonstrate that the PM approach performs \nwell at its task of retrieving from the database metabolite response \npatterns that are most similar to a query pattern, there are a num-\nber of important limitations to this approach that the user should \nbe aware of. Firstly, there is the issue of bias. The simplest bias is \nthat related to database content. The range of potential hits to any \nquery is obviously limited to what is represented in the reference \ndatabase. Thus, the best hit returned to a query does not neces-\nsarily represent the best hit that would be returned if the database \ncontained all data available in the literature. Fortunately, however, \nthe computation of the PM score using familiar statistical con-\ncepts and the incorporation of statistical significance testing into \nPM results means that the significance of returned hits can be \ninterpreted at “face value” . That is, a “strong” hit is likely to reflect a \nreal functional link regardless of whether another response might \nexist that would give a stronger hit. This is comparable to a strong \nBLAST match between a query and reference gene which suggests \nan evolutionary link between them even though closer homologs \nexist for each gene.\nAnother source of bias is linked to metabolome coverage (the \nsets of metabolites represented in metabolic phenotypes). The \nmaximum score achievable for any given phenotype comparison \nis dependent upon the number of metabolites involved in the \ncomparison. Matches based on more metabolites have more \nstatistical power in the Fisher’s Exact Test and can thus achieve \nlower FET2p p-values and thus higher (–log(FET2p)) terms than \nmatches based on fewer metabolites. While this means that hits \nare, appropriately, ranked according to the strength of the statisti-\ncal evidence for their similarity, it does introduce the potential \nfor “technology platform bias” whereby reference phenotypes \nthat have an inherently higher degree of overlap in metabolome \ncoverage with the query have the capacity to achieve a higher \nscore than other phenotypes that have less coverage. Higher \nmetabolome coverage overlap can be achieved, e.g., because both \nreference and queried metabolome were acquired on the same or \nsimilar analytical platform detecting a similar set of metabolites. \nFortunately, metabolite response directions and correlations \nbetween metabolic phenotypes are not influenced by technology \nplatform. That is, a strong hit will not arise simply because it \nwas acquired on a similar platform to the query. Moreover, the \npermutation-based significance test (Figures 3 and 4) inherently \nadjusts for “platform bias” in its determination of statistical \nsignificance because it determines the null score distribution by \nrepeatedly shuffling the same set of metabolites as included in \nthe query. Thus, the null score distribution from which p\nnon-bio is \nestimated will reflect the influence of any platform bias arising \nfrom metabolite coverage.\nAnother factor challenging the PM (also encountered with \nany tool attempting to detecting similarities between indepen-\ndently observed molecular response patterns for the purposes \nof inferring functional links) is experimental reproducibility. \nThe variable success of our attempts at cross-study matching \n(Table 4) highlights the fact that similar if not identical pertur -\nbations do not always result in significantly similar metabolite \nresponses being reported, even when the species, genetic \nbackground, analytical technology, and growth conditions are \nthe same or similar. For example, the failure of the phenotypes \nreported for hpr1  by Timm et al. (2012) to match strongly our \nhpr1 reference phenotype highlights the low reproducibility of \nthe metabolic phenotype in this mutant. This perhaps reflected \na rather high sensitivity to differences in growth conditions or \nthe subtlety of its phenotype (i.e., characterized by weak meta-\nbolic changes) causing its phenotypic signal to be obscured by \nanalytical noise.\nTaken together, the above observations underline the value in \nhaving the highest possible metabolome coverage, standardizing \nthe annotation of unidentified metabolites (sharing of standard-\nized spectral reference libraries) while employing effective bio-\nlogical replication and experimental design to minimize random \nexperimental noise and systematic errors.\nconclusion\nMetabolomics databases are growing rapidly in size and maturing \nin their development toward becoming analytical tools. By allowing \nindividual datasets to be analyzed and visualized using integrated \ntools, added-value metabolomics databases like Metabolomics \nWorkbench\n3 are making data more accessible, transparent, and \nuseful. However, to our knowledge, there are currently no other \nmetabolomics databases besides MetabolomeExpress equipped \ntools allowing data from independent  studies to be compared, \naligned, and thereby mined collectively for interesting patterns. \nThe incorporation of tools allowing cross-study analysis into \nmetabolomics databases offers to make metabolomics databases \nmore than the sum of their parts since the number of compari-\nsons possible between m metabolite response patterns is m\n2. We \nhope others find our observations and approaches useful in the \ndevelopment of similar tools.\nMaterials and Methods\nplant genotypes\nThe line used as the wild-type reference for metabolomics in \nthis study was A. thaliana ecotype Col-0. Analyzed mutant lines \nincluded: GDC-impaired mtkas-1 (Somerville and Ogren, 1982; \nEwald et  al., 2007), SHMT-impaired shm1-1 (Somerville and \nOgren, 1981; Voll et  al., 2006), Fd-GOGAT-impaired gls1-103 \nand gls1-113 (Somerville and Ogren, 1980a; Coschigano et  al., \n1998), DiT2-impaired dct  (Somerville and Ogren, 1983; Renné \net al., 2003), rubisco activase-impaired rca (Somerville et al., 1982; \nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 10616\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\nOrozco et  al., 1993), GLYK-impaired glyk  (Boldt et  al., 2005), \nSGAT-impaired agt1-1 and agt1-2 (Somerville and Ogren, 1980b; \nLiepman and Olsen, 2001), HPR1-impaired hpr1-1 (Timm et al., \n2008), peroxisomal catalase 2 (CAT2)-impaired cat2-2 (Queval \net  al., 2007), peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase 1 (pMDH1)-\nimpaired pmdh1, and peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase 2 \n(pMDH2)-impaired pmdh2, pMDH1- and pMDH2-impaired \ndouble mutant pmdh1pmdh2 (Pracharoenwattana et  al., 2007; \nCousins et al., 2008). Seed for these lines were obtained through \nthe Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center with the exception of \nthe pmdh, cat2-2, and agt1 mutant lines that were kindly provided \nby Pracharoenwattana et  al. (2007), Graham Noctor (Queval \net al., 2007), and (Liepman and Olsen, 2001), respectively.\nplant growth and Tissue harvest for \nMetabolomics \ne\nxperiments\nArabidopsis thaliana seeds were allowed to imbibe on wet filter \npaper and stratified for 5 days. Seeds were germinated and grown \non a mixture of potting soil (Debco seed raising mix) and 4  g \nOsmocote L\n−1 soil (Osmocote Exact Mini; Scotts Australia). Five \nreplicate plants of each genotype were grown under high CO 2 \nconditions at 6 mL L−1 CO2 in a controlled environment growth \ncabinet at an irradiance of 140 μmol quanta m−2 s−1 and air tem-\nperature of 22°C during the day and 18°C at night, with a day \nlength of 14 h. After 5 weeks, plants were transferred from high \n(CO\n2) to ambient (CO2) (400 μL L−1 CO2 but otherwise similar) \nconditions for 2 h before leaves were harvested for metabolomic \nanalysis. Harvesting was carried out by rapidly excising and \nsealing 50–100  mg of leaf tissue, cut at the base of the petiole, \nin a 2 ml polypropylene round-bottom safe-lock Eppendorf tube \n(Eppendorf; Cat. No. 0030 120.094) containing a 5 mm diameter \nstainless steel ball (Qiagen; Cat. No. 69989) and freezing in liquid \nnitrogen within 15 s. Harvested samples were kept frozen at −80°C \nuntil analysis. The genotypes were analyzed over three separate \nexperiments, each with its own set of wild-type control plants.\nMetabolite extraction\nFrozen leaf samples were pulverized in a TissueLyser II bead mill \n(Qiagen; Cat. No. 85300) for 1 min at 20 Hz. Approximately 30 mg \nof the resulting tissue powder was transferred and accurately \nweighed, without thawing, to a new, cold 2  mL round-bottom \nsafe-lock Eppendorf tube (Eppendorf; Cat. No. 0030 120.094). \nTubes were kept frozen on a tube rack chilled with liquid nitro-\ngen as five volumes (5 μL per mg fresh weight of tissue) of room \ntemperature extraction medium [85% (v/v) HPLC grade MeOH \n(Sigma), 15% (v/v) untreated MilliQ H\n2O, 100 ng μL−1 ribitol] was \nadded to each tube followed by brief vortexing to give thorough \nmixing of the solvent and tissue powder. Tubes were placed back \non liquid nitrogen until all the samples had been mixed with \nextraction medium. The tubes were then quickly transferred to \nan Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort (Eppendorf; Cat. No. 5355 \n000.011), rapidly heated to 60°C and shaken at 1400 RPM for \n15 min with internal gas pressure being released from tubes by \nmomentarily opening tube lids after 1 min of heating. Tubes were \nthen centrifuged at 20000 g for 10 min to pellet insoluble mate-\nrial and the supernatants transferred to new 2 mL round-bottom \nsafe-lock Eppendorf microfuge tubes (Eppendorf; Cat. No. 5355 \n000.011). These stock extracts were centrifuged again at 20000  g \nfor 10 min to ensure the complete absence of insoluble material \nand 20 μL aliquots of the supernatants were dried in 2 mL amber \ncrimp-cap autosampler vials (Grace Davison Discovery Sciences; \nCatalog Number 31811E-1232A) fitted with silanized glass 250 μL \nlow-volume inserts (Grace Davison Discovery Sciences; Cat. No. \n983228) using a Labconco CentriVap Acid-Resistant System \n(Labconco; Cat. No. 7983014) operated at room temperature.\nMetabolite Derivatization\nDried metabolite extracts were chemically derivatized by \nmethoximation and trimethylsilylation on a Gerstel MPS2XL \nMultipurpose Sampler (Gerstel) operating in the PrepAhead \nmode for automated online derivatization and sample injection. \nThe derivatization procedure consisted of the following steps: (1) \naddition of 10  μL of 20  mg  ml\n−1 methoxyamine hydrochloride \n(Supelco, Cat. # 33045-U) in anhydrous derivatization-grade \npyridine (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. # 270970) and incubation at 37°C \nfor 90 min with agitation at 750 RPM; (2) addition of 15  μL of \nderivatization grade N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroaceta-\nmide (MSTFA; Sigma-Aldrich; Cat. No. 394866) and incubation \nat 37°C for 30 min with agitation at 750 RPM; 3) addition of 5 μL \nof alkane mix [0.029% (v/v) n-dodecane, 0.029% (v/v) n-penta-\ndecane, 0.029% (w/v) n-non-adecane, 0.029% (w/v) n-docosane, \n0.029% (w/v) n-octacosane, 0.029% (w/v) n-dotriacontane, and \n0.029% (w/v) n-hexatriacontane dissolved in anhydrous pyri-\ndine] and incubation for 1 min at 37°C with agitation at 750 RPM. \nSamples were injected into the GC/MS instrument immediately \nafter derivatization.\ngas chromatography/Mass Spectrometry \nMetabolomic Analysis\nDerivatized metabolite samples were analyzed on an Agilent \n5975C GC/MSD system comprised of an Agilent GC 7890N \ngas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, \nUSA) and 5975C Inert MSD quadrupole MS detector (Agilent \nTechnologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The GC was fitted with a \n0.25  mm ID, 0.25  μm film thickness, 30  m Varian FactorFour \nVF-5 ms capillary column with 10 m integrated guard column \n(Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA; Product No. CP9013). Samples \nwere injected into the split/splitless injector operating in splitless \nmode with an injection volume of 1  μL, an initial septum purge \nflow of 3 mL min\n−1 increasing to 20 mL min −1 after 1 min and \na constant inlet temperature of 230°C. Helium carrier gas flow \nrate was held constant at 1 mL min\n−1. The GC column oven was \nheld at the initial temperature of 70°C for 1  min before being \nincreased to 325°C at 15°C  min\n−1 before being held at 325°C \nfor 3 min. Total run time was 21 min. Transfer line temperature \nwas 250°C. MS source temperature was 250°C. Quadrupole \ntemperature was 150°C. Electron Impact ionization energy was \n70  eV and the MS detector was operated in full scan mode in \nthe range of 40–600  m/z with a scan rate of 3.6  Hz. The MSD \nwas pre-tuned against perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) mass \ncalibrant using the “atune.u” autotune method provided with \nAgilent GC/MSD Productivity ChemStation Software (Revision \nE.02.01.1177; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA; Product \nNo. G1701EA).\nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 10617\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\nMetabolomics Data processing  \nand Statistical Analysis\nAll GC/MS data were processed using the online MetabolomeExpress \ndata processing pipeline4 (Carroll et al., 2010). Raw GC/MS files \nwere exported to NetCDF format using Agilent MSD ChemStation \nsoftware (Revision E.02.01.1177; Agilent Technologies, Palo \nAlto, CA, USA; Product No. G1701EA) and NetCDF files were \nuploaded to the ANU_Badger MetabolomeExpress  data reposi-\ntory. Peak detection settings were: Slope threshold  =  200; Min \nPeak Area  =  1000; Min. Peak Height  =  500; Min. Peak Purity \nFactor = 2; Min. Peak Width (Scans)  = 5; Extract Peaks  = on. \nPeaks were identified by MSRI library matching which used \nretention index and mass-spectral similarity as identification \ncriteria. MSRI library matching parameters were as follows: RI \nWindow = ± 2 RI Units; MST Centroid Distance = ± 1 RI Unit; \nMin. Peak Area (for peak import): 5000; MS Qualifier Ion Ratio \nError Tolerance = 30%; Min. Number of Correct Ratio Qualifier \nIons = 2; Max. Average MS Ratio Error  = 70%; Remove quali-\nfier ion not time-correlated with quantifier ion  = OFF; Primary \nMSRI Library  =  “Carroll_2014_Arabidopsis_Photorespiration_\nMutants.MSRI”; Add Unidentified Peaks to Custom MSRI \nLibrary  =  OFF; Use RI calibration file specified in metadata \nfile  =  ON; Carry out per-sample fine RI calibration using \ninternal RI standards  =  OFF . The Carroll_2014_Arabidopsis_\nPhotorespiration_Mutants.MSRI primary library contains entries \nderived manually from analyses of authentic metabolite standards \nrun under the same GC/MS conditions as the biological samples \nas well as entries for unidentified peaks that were automatically \ngenerated by MetabolomeExpress while processing the data from \nthe reference photorespiration mutants.\nLibrary matching results were then used to construct a \nmetabolite x sample data matrix with peak areas being nor -\nmalized to internal standard (i.e., ribitol). As a quality control \nfilter, samples were checked for the presence of a strong ribitol \npeak with a peak area of at least 1  × 10\n5 and a deviation from \nthe median internal standard peak area (for that GC/MS batch \nsequence) of less than 70% of the median value. Statistical \nnormalization to tissue mass was not required because chemi-\ncal normalization to tissue mass had already been carried out \nby adjusting extraction solvent volume proportionally to tissue \nmass. For determination of metabolic phenotypes, the mutant/\ngenotype SIR of each metabolite was calculated by dividing the \nmean (normalized) signal intensity of each metabolite in each \nset of mutant plants by its mean (normalized) signal intensity \nin its associated set of wild-type control plants. Statistical sig-\nnificances were calculated by two-tailed Welch’s t-tests (n  =  5) \nin the MetabolomeExpress  Comparative Statistics tool. The full \ndataset has been uploaded to the MetabolomeExpress Phenotype \nDatabase (MetabolomeExpress Dataset IDs 36, 42, and 43) and \nwill be made publicly accessible upon publication of this article.\nnext-generation genome Sequencing\nGenomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant \nMini Kit following the manufacturer’s instruction. Quality \n4 https://www.metabolome-express.org\nwas checked using spectrophotometer and agarose gel electro-\nphoresis. DNA concentrations were determined by the Qubit \n(Invitrogen) system. Genomic libraries were constructed using \nthe TruSeq\nTM DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) following \nthe manufacturer’s Low-Throughput Protocol. Briefly, 1  μg of \ngenomic DNA was fragmented by Covaris shearing to produce \n300–400 bp fragments. After repairing the ends of the fragments \nto produce blunt ends, 3′ adenylation was performed, followed by \nligating distinct DNA adapter indexes to distinct genotypes. The \nligation products were enriched by 10 cycles of PCR. The size of \nthe products was analyzed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent \nTechnology). The DNA libraries were diluted and pooled so that \nequal amount of DNA from each genotype was sequenced on a \nlane of a flow cell, with seven libraries on a single lane. DNA was \nsequenced using a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) 100  bp paired-ends \nreads at the Biomolecular Research Facility at the Australian \nNational University John Curtin School of Medical Research \n(JCSMR). Reads that had been de-multiplexed and filtered using \nthe instrument manufacturer’s software were supplied by the facil-\nity. Alignment of reads from each mutant to the Col-0 reference \ngenome assembly (ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen/phytozome/\nv9.0/Athaliana/annotation/Athaliana_167_protein.fa.gz) avail-\nable at Phytozome (Goodstein et al., 2012) was performed using \nBWA  (Li and Durbin, 2009). Single nucleotide polymorphisms \n(SNPs) were detected using SAMtools (Li et al., 2009). The scripts \nused to align reads and detect SNPs are provided in Data Sheet \nS1 in Supplementary Material. SNPs within or close to known \nphotorespiratory genes were retrieved from VCF files generated \nby SAMtools using a custom PHP script to retrieve any SNPs \nlying between 1000bp upstream of the start coordinates and the \nend coordinates of the known photorespiratory genes provided in \nTable S2 in Supplementary Material. The effects of SNPs on pro-\ntein sequences were predicted using the ENSEMBL Plant Variant \nEffect Predictor.\n5 The conservation of the affected amino acids \nacross plants was assessed using PipeAlign (Plewniak et al., 2003).\nprotein extraction, electrophoresis  \nand Immunodetection\nLeaf total protein was extracted with buffer containing 50 mM \nEPPS, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl\n2, 1% PVPP , 1% Triton \nX-100, and 10  mM DTT. Protein (10  μg) was separated using \n4 -12% NuPAGE ® Bis-Tris Precast Gel (Inivitrogen), then \ntransferred onto PVDF membrane. The Fd-GOGAT protein was \ndetected with rabbit anti-Fd-GOGAT antibody (Agrisera). An \nAP-conjugated Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) and \nAP-conjugate substrate kit (BioRad) were used for detection of \nthe primary antibody.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Australian Research Council \nthrough the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence \nfor Plant Energy Biology (grant number CE0561495), Australian \nResearch Council Centre of Excellence for Translational \n5 http://plants.ensembl.org/tools.html\nJuly 2015 | Volume 3 | Article 10618\nCarroll et al.\nPhenoMeter: matching metabolic phenotypes\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology |  www .frontiersin.org\nReferences\nAltschul, S.
