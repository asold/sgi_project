    "abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates the operation inspection and anomaly diagnosis of transformers in substations, and carries out an application study of artificial intelligence-based sound recognition technology in transformer discharge diagnosis to improve the timeliness and diagnostic capability of intelligent monitoring of substation equipment operation. In this study, a sound parameterization technology in the field of sound recognition is used to implement automatic discharge sound detections. The sound samples are pre-processed and then Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted as features, which are used to train Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Finally, the trained GMMs are used to detect discharge sounds in the place of transformers in substations. The test results demonstrate that the audio anomaly detection based on MFCCs and GMMs can be used to effectively recognize anomalous discharge in the high scenario of transformers.",
