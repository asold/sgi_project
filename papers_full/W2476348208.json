Jacobs 1 • Auguste von Bayern 2,3 • Mathias Osvath 1\nReceived: 17 December 2015 / Revised: 2 July 2016 / Accepted: 14 July 2016 / Published online: 20 July 2016\n/C211The Author(s) 2016. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nAbstract New Caledonian crows ( Corvus moneduloides )\nrely heavily on a range of tools to extract prey. They\nmanufacture novel tools, save tools for later use, and have\nmorphological features that facilitate tool use. We report\nsix observations, in two individuals, of a novel tool-use\nmode not previously reported in non-human animals.\nInsert-and-transport tool use involves inserting a stick into\nan object and then moving away, thereby transporting both\nobject and tool. All transported objects were non-food\nobjects. One subject used a stick to transport an object that\nwas too large to be handled by beak, which suggests the\ntool facilitated object control. The function in the other\ncases is unclear but seems to be an expression of play or\nexploration. Further studies should investigate whether it is\nadaptive in the wild and to what extent crows can ﬂexibly\napply the behaviour in experimental settings when purpo-\nsive transportation of objects is advantageous.\nKeywords Tool use /C1New Caledonian crow /C1Play /C1\nObject exploration /C1Tool transport\nIntroduction\nNew Caledonian crows ( Corvus moneduloides ) are habitual\nand proﬁcient tool users. They use and manufacture tools in\nseveral modes in both natural settings and captivity (animal\ntool use is reviewed in Bentley-Condit and Smith 2010;\nMcGrew 2013; Shumaker et al. 2011, with additional\nmodes in New Caledonian crows described by Jelbert et al.\n2014; Taylor et al. 2012; Troscianko et al. 2008; von\nBayern et al. 2009). A large portion of their daily caloric\nintake may be obtained through tool use (Rutz et al. 2010).\nTheir reliance on tools has possibly resulted in morpho-\nlogical adaptations: a wide binocular overlap, eye lateral-\nity, and a short, straight, stout beak (Martinho et al. 2014;\nMatsui et al. 2016; Troscianko et al. 2012). They secure\ntools after extracting prey by trapping it underfoot or\nstoring it in a hole—doing so more often when tool\navailability is limited and the cost of tool loss is higher\n(Hunt 1996; Klump et al. 2015). They also use tools to\nexplore predator models (Wimpenny et al. 2011)o rt o\nreach for food in their presence (Taylor et al. 2012).\nWe present a novel type of spontaneous tool use that has not\npreviously been described in any species. We deﬁne insert-\nand-transport tool use as inserting a stick or stick-like object\ninto another object, and carrying tool and target object away\ntogether by holding the tool only. We discuss the possible\nfunctions of this tool-use mode in the context of both the\ncurrent investigation and the crows’ natural environment.\nMethods\nWe observed this new tool-use mode in two adult New\nCaledonian crows, Liane (female) and Aigaios (male). The\nobservations were made in everyday situations and also in\nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this\narticle (doi: 10.1007/s10071-016-1016-z) contains supplementary\nmaterial, which is available to authorized users.\n& Ivo F.

They\nwere wild-caught on New Caledonia as part of family\ngroups two and a half years earlier. They were housed at\nthe Avian Cognition Research Station associated to the\nMax Planck Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen, Ger-\nmany. They were housed in pairs or family groups in\noutdoor aviaries of between 18 and 32 m\n2 with constant\naccess to heated and lit indoor compartments of approxi-\nmately 7 m 2. Food and water were available ad libitum.\nIn the unrelated study, in which we observed some\ninstances of the tool-use behaviour, the crows had eight\n12-min trials in which they had the opportunity to interact\nwith 16 initially novel objects, hereafter referred to as\nexperimental tools/objects (see Fig. 1). All observations\nwere video recorded; the recordings are available in the\nElectronic Supplementary Material for this paper. No sta-\ntistical analyses were performed because of the low num-\nber of total occurrences.\nResults\nIn total, six instances of insert-and-transport tool use were\nrecorded: four in the experimental and two in an everyday\nsetting (see Table 1; ESM). Liane exhibited the behaviour\nin both situations. The four observations during the unre-\nlated object-caching study involved an experimental tool\ntwice. During none of the observations did we detect\nindications of stress such as approach–avoidance behaviour\nor sudden jumps. The subjects landed on the table volun-\ntarily without any food incentive, and approached calmly\nand directly.\nBoth subjects ﬁrst held the target object in their beak\nbefore using the tool, with the only exception being\nObservation 2, where Aigaios tried but failed to pick up a\nlarge wooden ball. He initially attempted to insert an\nexperimental tool, without success. He returned with a\nthinner, natural stick, inserted it into a small hole in the\nball, lifted the ball using the stick, and ﬂew off (see Fig. 2).\nIn Observation 6, Liane inserted a tool into a non-ex-\nperimental object, which she carried and then inserted into\na fold in a canvas sheet that lay on the ground. She used the\ntool to push the object further in. To our knowledge, this\nmarks the ﬁrst observation of New Caledonian crows using\na tool for caching.\nDiscussion\nTwo New Caledonian crows exhibited a novel tool beha-\nviour not previously reported for any non-human species\n(cf. Bentley-Condit and Smith 2010; McGrew 2013; Shu-\nmaker et al. 2011): inserting a stick into an object and using\nthe stick to transport it. The behaviour clearly differs from\nthe contain mode, deﬁned as placing ‘‘ﬂuids or objects into\nFig. 1 Tools and objects used for insert-and-transport tool use.\na Experimental square wooden stick; b experimental metal nut; c non-\nexperimental natural wooden stick (various types were used, but they\nwere always thinner than the experimental sticks); d experimental\nround wooden stick; e experimental large wooden ball; f experimental\nsmall wooden ball; g non-experimental beech cupule ( Fagus sylvat-\nica); h non-experimental bamboo skewer; i non-experimental plastic\ncap\n1250 Anim Cogn (2016) 19:1249–1252\n123\nor on top of another object (the tool) to control and/or\ntransport them’’ (Shumaker et al. 2011, p. 14). Whereas\ncontainers can carry ﬂuids or assemblages of very small\nobjects, the tool reported here did not contain the object\nand transported only a single object. Moreover, control\nover the object did not appear to determine the behaviour;\nin most cases, the target object could be moved more\neffectively using the beak alone.\nIt is possible that the crows perceived the objects as\npotentially harmful and that such risk was mitigated by use\nof a tool. New Caledonian crows use stick tools to explore\nnovel objects (Wimpenny et al. 2011) and avoid possible\nrisks (Taylor et al. 2012). However, such explanations\nseem insufﬁcient for our ﬁndings. In all cases, the crows\nhad touched the objects with their beaks at least once\nbefore, so the objects were not truly novel. The crows also\nshowed no neophobic reaction towards the objects and\nreadily interacted with them. Neither does food search\nexplain the behaviour. The objects in these observations\nhad never been associated with food, and foraging tech-\nniques in the wild differ notably from our observations.\nA possible functional explanation for insert-and-trans-\nport tool use is the simultaneous transport of both a tool\nand an object (or food item), which could be adaptive in the\nwild. New Caledonian crows often secure their tools while\nforaging, especially at greater heights where suitable tools\nbecome scarce (Klump et al. 2015). Although our experi-\nment only involved non-food items, crows might target\nfood as well: notably food with an opening that is either not\nimmediately consumed or too large to be handled easily,\nsuch as half-opened seashells or large snails.\nSubjects did not always transport the tool and object\nvery far in our captive setting. There was also no clear\nreason why they would transport the object in the ﬁrst\nplace. Sometimes they brought their tool from another\nroom, which was unnecessary if the goal was to transport\nTable 1 Overview of all\nobservations of insert-and-\ntransport tool use\nObservation Date Subject Condition Tool Object\n1 09-03-2013 Liane Experimental a b\n2 13-03-2013 Aigaios Experimental c e\n3 13-03-2013 Aigaios Experimental c f\n4 19-03-2013 Liane Experimental d b\n5 26-02-2014 Liane Non-experimental c g\n6 26-02-2014 Liane Non-experimental h i\nThe tool and object lettering refers to Fig. 1\nFig. 2 Still-frame sequence from a video showing Aigaios using a\nnatural stick to move a large wooden ball (Observation 2; time stamps\nin parentheses). a He attempts to pick up the ball but fails (0:58); b he\npicks up an experimental stick (see Fig. 1d), fails to insert it into the\nhole in the ball, tries to pick up the ball with his beak but fails again,\nand then leaves the experimental area (1:48); c he returns with a thin\nnon-experimental stick and inserts it into the ball (6:44); d the stick-\nand-ball combination allows him to lift the ball off the table (6:53);\ne he moves the combined object (6:57); f he puts tool and object on\nthe table and leaves the experimental room (6:59); g he returns and\nlooks down the tool into the hole in the ball (7:29); h he grasps the\nstick and leaves the experimental room, simultaneously transporting\ntool and target object (7:33)\nAnim Cogn (2016) 19:1249–1252 1251\n123\nthe object, given that they could carry the object in their\nbeak. In most cases, using a tool was less effective for\ntransportation: it took time to insert the tool correctly and\nthe tool-object combination was heavier. Given those time\nand energy costs, why would the crows use tools when they\ndid not need to?\nOne case (Observation 2) indicated potential purpose-\nfulness of this behaviour; the subject struggled with\ngrasping a large wooden ball and then successfully trans-\nported it with a stick. This indicates another possible\nfunction of this tool-use mode, namely control over\nunwieldy objects. The beak morphology of New Caledo-\nnian crows facilitates stick manipulation (Matsui et al.\n2016; Troscianko et al. 2012), but it constrains handling\nmany other objects. In the other observations, insert-and-\ntransport tool use is perhaps best explained as a form of\nexploration or play because it was performed voluntarily in\na low-stress setting without clear immediate beneﬁt or\npurpose (Burghardt 2005), at least in the captive setting in\nwhich we have detected it. Playful stick handling develops\ninto tool use in juveniles, even in the absence of demon-\nstrators, which suggests it is an inherited action pattern\n(Kenward et al. 2006).\nInsert-and-transport is a novel tool-use mode in animals\nas it differs notably from previously described modes. Our\nobservations could be innovations originating in play and\ndevelopment without the purpose of transporting objects.\nFurther research is needed to investigate whether it is a\nspecies-typical behaviour that might be adaptive, and\ncontrolled studies in captivity should establish the extent to\nwhich New Caledonian crows can apply this behaviour\nﬂexibly for purposes of transport.\nAcknowledgments Ivo Jacobs and Mathias Osvath thank the\nCrafoord Foundation, and Auguste von Bayern thanks the Max-\nPlanck-Society for funding.\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConﬂict of interest The authors declare that they have no conﬂict of\ninterest.\nEthical approval All applicable international, national, and/or\ninstitutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed.\nNo speciﬁc permissions were required under German law for this non-\ninvasive study.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License ( http://crea\ntivecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use,\ndistribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a\nlink to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were\nmade.\nReferences\nBentley-Condit VK, Smith EO (2010) Animal tool use: current\ndeﬁnitions and an updated comprehensive catalog.
