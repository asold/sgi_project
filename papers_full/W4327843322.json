  "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;This study presents a method for extracting transformer parameters using simulations in the Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) electromagnetic solver. The extracted parameters represent a full model of a linear transformer and can be used in Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) simulations. A model of the two-winding transformer is presented in three variants, for which different approaches were used in the transformer simulation in the SPICE program, all yielding the same simulation results. A three-winding transformer T-model extraction is also developed in the study. A method for extracting transformer parameters from FEMM is proposed, along with an automated tool based on a scripting language built into the FEMM software.&lt;/p&gt;",
