    "abstract": "Abstract Power transformers play an important and significant role in the power system to connecting the subsystems and delivering the electricity to consumers. Power transformers are one of the most expensive elements in the power system, so focus on their status of parameters is the primary task. The reliability assessment and efficiency of the transformers have a major impact on the security. The power transformers constantly subjected to failures in its components, and their effect is interruptions of consumer’s supply and reliability. So, methodology related to reliability assessment of power transformers includes; monitoring of operation status, type of failures, forced outages and interruption time. The study includes; type of failures, reliability and condition assessment based on statistical data monitoring during the years in the Power Transmission System of Kosovo.",
