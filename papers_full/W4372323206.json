Costs are increasing, response rates\nare declining (Keeter et al. 2017), and there are growing concerns about inaccuracy (Kennedy\net al. 2018; Clinton et al. 2021a, 2022). These patterns have raised questions about biases due to\ncoverage and non-response (e.g., Cavari and Freedman 2022, though see Mellon and Prosser 2021)\nand have even led some to question the viability of polling itself (Meyer et al. 2015; Keeter 2018).\nAssessments of public opinion based only on the most accessible and numerous groups risk missing\nimportant voices in an ever more diverse polity (Brehm 1993; Berinsky 2004). At the same time,\npolls are necessary tools to assess and address growing concerns about polarization and democratic\nbacksliding (Graham 2023; Waldner and Lust 2018). When done well, public opinion polls allow\nscholars, policymakers, and journalists to assess the opinions of the whole public—not just those\nwho are the most active, willing, and able to express their opinions through more costly means like\ndirect appeals, protests, and donations.\nGiven the rising expense and difficulty of interviewing respondents, researchers increasingly turn\nto other methods of characterizing public opinion and sentiment—especially for groups that are\nsmaller or harder to reach (Wang et al. 2015; Ghitza and Gelman 2020; van Klingeren et al. 2021).\nSome use non-survey data, most often from social media platforms like Twitter, to characterize\npublic opinion (e.g., Beauchamp 2017; Tucker 2017; though see Bail 2022). Others use sophisticated\nweighting methods like multilevel regression poststratification to leverage observed relationships\namong respondents who are surveyed to characterize the opinions of those who are not (Gelman\n1997; Lax and Phillips 2009; Ghitza and Gelman 2013; Caughey and Warshaw 2015; Bisbee 2019;\nGoplerud 2023).\nLarge Language Models (hereafter LLMs) that synthesize vast corpora of human-generated\ntext—including political news, opinion, and debate— might look like the new frontier in charac-\nterizing public opinion without the expense of traditional polling. Nearly every day, a new working\npaper asserts the benefits and possibilities of this technology. Social scientists have already used\nLLMs to label political data (T¨ ornberg 2023; Gilardi et al. 2023), estimate politicians’ ideology\n(Wu et al. 2023), and generate synthetic samples for pilot testing (Argyle et al. 2023; Horton 2023).\nAt least one startup in private industry suggests that “synthetic users” can supplement or replace\n1\nhuman respondents in development and marketing.1 If LLMs have the potential to reorient nearly\nevery facet of economic and social life (Bommasani et al. 2022), then perhaps they could revolution-\nize public opinion research too. Can a pretrained LLM produce synthetic opinions for respondent\npersonas that accurately mirror what similar human respondents would say on a real survey? 2 In-\nstead of spending $14 million to interview humans in the 2024 American National Election Study,\nfor example, might researchers instead spend $90 (the cost of the initial study we conducted) to\nobtain an accurate portrayal of American public opinion using synthetic samples from an LLM?\nTo evaluate these questions, we prompt ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo 3 (OpenAI 2021) to first adopt\nvarious personas defined by demographic and political characteristics 4 and then answer a battery\nof questions about feelings towards social and political groups. We refer to these responses as\n“synthetic data”, which is occasionally referred to in related research as “silicon samples” (Argyle\net al. 2023). 5 To facilitate comparison to widely used public opinion data, the characteristics\ndefining each persona in our synthetic data are taken from real respondents in the 2016 and 2020\nAmerican National Election Study, and our survey questions closely mirror the ANES’s feeling\nthermometer questions.\nOur primary analysis compares the distribution of responses from synthetic ChatGPT personas\nto matching corresponding respondents in the ANES. We focus on three metrics of interest to\nsocial scientists: (1) how well ChatGPT recovers the overall mean and variance of feelings towards\nvarious groups, (2) how closely the (conditional) correlations between persona characteristics and\n1https://www.syntheticusers.com.\n2We rely on the corpus contained in a pretrained LLM rather than fine-tuning (e.g., as in Argyle et al. 2023)\nbecause this workflow is more accessible and more likely to be used by journalists, politicians, and the modal academic\n(Cowen 2022).\n3We focus on ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo because its release was what prompted the flurry of researcher and public\ninterest that initially motivated this project. More practically, it was the largest and most popular pretrained LLM\nwith public API access at the time we began our research. We replicate some of our results using the even larger\nChatGPT 4.0 and the open-source model Falcon-40B-Instruct; see SI Sections 11 and 14 for details.\n4By prompting the LLM to adopt particular characteristics, including party identification and political ideology,\nwe differ from earlier research identifying political bias in the “default” persona (Rozado 2023; Santurkar et al. 2023).\nIn an auxiliary analysis, we find similar results on ChatGPT’s default bias; see SI Section 7.\n5Our approach differs in the details from Argyle et al. (2023) who fine tune a generative pre-trained transformer\n(GPT) using real survey data to generate their “silicon” samples. In contrast, we simply ask ChatGPT 3.5 to adopt\na given persona to collect our synthetic data.\n2\nsurvey responses mirror the inferences we would draw from the ANES, and (3) the sensitivity of\nour comparisons to changes in the prompt, the LLM, and the timing of data collection. To briefly\nsummarize, ChatGPT produces feeling thermometer scores whose averages closely track baseline\nANES values, but it performs poorly by our other metrics—including the ones that represent\nstandard inferential tasks in political science research.\nAt the coarsest level of analysis, synthetic ChatGPT opinions look remarkably similar to human\nANES respondents. Across the 11 groups for which we generate feeling thermometer scores, the\naverage response in our synthetic data is always within a standard deviation of the ANES average\n(range of 5.2 to 28.9 standard deviations for the synthetic data, and 19.5 to 31.9 for the ANES\ndata). However, even when we compare overall average responses, we find problems with how\nwell ChatGPT recovers the distribution of public opinion. The standard deviation of each feeling\nthermometer in our synthetic data is on average about half (0.62) as large as in the ANES data\nand in 4 out of 11 cases, the standard deviation is less than half the ANES value. Even if the\naverages from the synthetic sample provide a roughly accurate high-level look at public feelings\ntowards different groups, the underestimation of variance sharply limits the LLM’s usefulness for\nstatistical inference, including for the purpose of pre-testing questions or piloting studies.\nThe synthetic sample fares worse when we examine higher-order relationships. First, while our\noverall averages closely correspond to the ANES values, the same is not true when we investigate\nsubstantively relevant subgroups. For example, compared to the subgroup averages in the ANES\ndata, the synthetic estimates overestimate Democrats’ evaluation of liberals and the Democratic\nParty, while underestimating their feelings toward conservatives. The problem of insufficient varia-\ntion is even more severe at the subgroup level; the standard deviation of opinions for a given persona\nprofile is on average just 31% that of matched human opinion from the ANES data. Second, when\nwe regress feeling thermometer scores on respondents’ demographic attributes—the type of anal-\nysis common in public opinion research—the synthetic sample would frequently lead us to draw\ndifferent inferences than if we relied on human respondents. 48% of coefficients estimated from the\nChatGPT responses are statistically significantly different from their ANES-derived counterpart;\namong these cases, the sign of the effect flips 32% of the time. Simply put, a political scientist\nwho runs a public opinion regression on synthetic responses from a pretrained LLM cannot have\nconfidence that their effect estimates will be qualitatively similar to what they would obtain from\n3\na traditional survey.\nIf these statistical mismatches were not enough of a problem on their own, we document auxiliary\nissues leading us to question the reliability and reproducibility of sampling via ChatGPT. The most\nconcerning of these is that the distribution of responses to the same prompt changed between our\ninitial run in April 2023 and a rerun in July 2023, even though we were ostensibly sampling from\nthe same ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo model. This is a key illustration of how closed-source generative\nmodels pose a threat to the reproducibility norms of contemporary social science (Spirling 2023).\nBesides these reproducibility concerns, we also find that the distribution of results is sensitive to\nsmall differences in the prompt structure: For example, the means of the synthetic thermometers\ncome closer to their ANES counterparts when we use a first-person rather than a third-person\nprompt, even though the same demographic information is presented to the LLM in both cases.\nOur findings raise serious questions about the use and performance of LLMs for the charac-\nterization of human opinion and the creation of synthetic data, connecting with a growing body\nof research that asks similar questions (Bender et al. 2021; Spirling 2023) and documents similar\nissues (Motoki et al. 2023; Rozado 2023; Abdulhai et al. 2023; Cao et al. 2023). When we prompt\nLLMs to adopt personas matching actual ANES respondents, we end up with data that largely\nfails to replicate our best estimates of the correlates of human opinion. 6 While it is, of course,\npossible that continuing technological innovations will someday produce more stable, knowable,\nand accurate synthetic responses than the ones we document, our work challenges the utility of\nusing LLMs to create synthetic data for social science research.\n2 Research Design and Data\nAn LLM is a prediction algorithm optimized to predict the next token in a sequence of text data.\nWhen prompted to take on a persona with a set of attributes and answer a question from that\nperspective, contemporary LLMs can provide remarkably coherent responses. The largest models\nhave demonstrated remarkable emergent abilities well outside the core text-sequencing tasks at\n6It is possible that the ANES is worse at recovering the true population parameters of interest than the LLM,\nperhaps due to the issues with current public opinion polling discussed above. However, without a census of public\nopinion against which to compare, it seems irresponsible to jump to this interpretation of the discrepancies we\ndocument below between the synthetic and human samples.\n4\nthe core of their training (Wei et al. 2022). The uncanny coherence of LLM responses to a wide\nvariety of prompts have generated considerable excitement about the possibility of using these\nmodels to generate responses that are representative of public opinion. For example, Argyle et al.\n(2023) conclude that “by conditioning the model on thousands of socioeconomic backstories from\nreal human[s],” LLMs are able to generate synthetic opinions that “reflect[] the complex interplay\nbetween ideas, attitudes, and sociocultural context that characterize human attitudes.” 7\nBut how far can we push this conclusion? If we ask an LLM to act as though it were a 30-year\nold White male Republican with a high-school degree and ask about its feelings toward Democrats,\ncan we expect its responses to mirror the distribution of opinions in that group? 8 The vast corpus\nused to train these models (see, e.g., Washington Post 2023) contains reams of political writing\nthat could, perhaps, be used to construct nuanced depictions of opinions across groups. But when\nthat vast corpus comes from the Internet, the content may be unrepresentative of the public at\nlarge, or at least some groups within it (Bail 2022). 9 Scholars have previously probed the default\npersona of ChatGPT by prompting it to answer a battery of survey questions and showing that\nthe resulting responses have ideological, dispositional, and psychological biases (Motoki et al. 2023;\nRozado 2023; Bail 2022; Abdulhai et al. 2023), but it is unknown how well pretrained LLMs can\nreproduce human opinion when prompted to adopt a particular persona. The precise recipe that\ngenerates responses from ChatGPT is a trade secret, 10 so our approach is to generate a data set\nof synthetic opinions from ChatGPT that we can compare to opinions from a survey of human\nrespondents.\nTo examine a pretrained LLM’s ability to simulate the opinions of respondents defined by a\nparticular set of features, we use a survey instrument known as a “feeling thermometer.” Respon-\n7Argyle et al. (2023) use GPT-3, a predecessor to the GPT-3.5 LLM underlying the ChatGPT program we query\nin our main analysis.\n8Our main analysis focuses on whether we can do this. A more fundamental question that we return to in the\nconclusion is whether we should.\n9Volumes of research have shown that humans online are less thoughtful and more hurtful (Lapidot-Lefler and\nBarak 2012; Rowe 2015); less able to reason and quicker to rely on stereotypes and heuristics (Halpern and Gibbs\n2013); more willing to villainize those who disagree with them and less willing to engage in empathy (Rowe 2015;\nRossini 2022); and more inclined to express themselves to signal group attachments (Bail 2022).\n10For this reason, some scholars have argued for rejecting proprietary, closed-source LLMs (Spirling 2023)—an\nargument that prompted our investigation of the open-source Falcon-40B-Instruct model (see SI 14).\n5\ndents are instructed to consider some group and to indicate the degree to which they experience\nwarm (positive, affectionate, etc.) or cool (negative, disdainful, etc.) feelings toward members of\nthat group. This instrument has been employed by major polling outfits since 1964, and it is widely\nused by scholars to characterize the extent of societal division (Druckman and Levendusky 2019;\nIyengar and Westwood 2019). After instructing the LLM to adopt a persona defined by a set of\nrespondent characteristics, we then ask it to answer a battery of feeling thermometer questions. We\nchoose respondent personas and feeling thermometers to match questions that human respondents\nwere asked in a real public opinion survey, allowing us to gauge how accurately and precisely the\nsynthetic LLM responses capture actual human opinion. 11\nWe conduct our primary investigation using perhaps the most publicized and popular software\nbuilt on a pretrained LLM, ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo (OpenAI 2021). To characterize how robust\nour results are to differences across LLMs (as well as changes in the “same” LLM over time), we\nreplicate portions of our analysis with ChatGPT 4.0; with ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo both before and\nafter its update on June 25, 2023; and with the open-source model Falcon-40B-Instruct. 12\nWe iterated on several different versions of a prompt to gather our synthetic data, the full\ndescription of which can be found in the SI Section 1. Our main results are based on the most\ndetailed version of a prompt in which we instructed ChatGPT to adopt a persona defined as follows:\n“It is [YEAR]. You are a[AGE] year-old, [MARST], [RACETH] [GENDER]with [EDUCATION]\nmaking [INCOME] per year, living in the United States. You are [IDEO], [REGIS] [PID]\nwho [INTEREST] pays attention to what’s going on in government and politics.” 13\nIn each query to ChatGPT, the characteristics in brackets were substituted with values correspond-\ning to a real respondent in the 2016 or 2020 wave of the ANES. These values include:\n11We also test a battery of other questions that rely on conventional Likert-style survey instruments, pertaining\nto the role of government in the economy, and to restrictions placed on protesters and revolutionaries. These results\ncan be found in SI Section 12.\n12Highlighting issues with replicability, our original analyses were conducted on the pre-June 25 version of Chat-\nGPT 3.5 Turbo, but that version is only accessible until September 2023.\n13We chose these covariates based on their utilization for weighting and poststratification in the survey methods\nliterature (Lax and Phillips 2009; Ghitza and Gelman 2013), as well as adhering to the norms of weight calculation\nin the ANES itself (DeBell and Krosnick 2009). In Section 4.1, we demonstrate that the synthetic data is sensitive\nto which attributes are included in the prompt, finding that the majority of the performance hinges on the political\ncovariates.\n6\n• [YEAR]: 2016 or 2020\n• [AGE]: age in years of ANES respondent\n• [RACETH]: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic\n• [GENDER]: male or female\n• [MARST]: divorced, married, separated, single, or widowed\n• [EDUCATION]: a high school diploma, some college but no degree, a bachelor’s degree or more\n• [INCOME]: $30k, $50k, $80k, $100k, $150k or more\n• [IDEO]: an extremely liberal, a liberal, a slightly liberal, a moderate, a slightly conservative,\na conservative, an extremely conservative\n• [REGIS]: registered, unregistered\n• [PID]: Democrat, Independent, Republican\n• [INTEREST]: never, sometimes, frequently, regularly, always\nFor our primary analyses, the LLM was then prompted as follows:\n“Provide responses from this person’s perspective. Use only knowledge about politics\nthat they would have. Format the output as a tsv table with the following format:\ngroup,thermometer,explanation,confidence\nThe following questions ask about individuals’ feelings toward different groups. Re-\nsponses should be given on a scale from 0 (meaning cold feelings) to 100 (meaning\nwarm feelings). Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favor-\nable and warm toward the group. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that\nyou don’t feel favorable toward the group and that you don’t care too much for that\ngroup. You would rate the group at the 50 degree mark if you don’t feel particularly\nwarm or cold toward the group.\nHow do you feel toward the following groups?\nThe Democratic Party?\nThe Republican Party?\nDemocrats?\nRepublicans?\nBlack Americans?\nWhite Americans?\nHispanic Americans?\nAsian Americans?\nMuslims?\nChristians?\nImmigrants?\nGays and Lesbians?\nJews?\n7\nLiberals?\nConservatives?\nWomen?”\nWe prompt 30 synthetic respondents for each of the 7,530 human respondents in the ANES\nsurvey, yielding a final dataset of 3,614,400 responses. 14 For each response, we record both the\nnumeric feeling thermometer score, the explanation provided by the LLM for why they chose the\nscore, and a measure of the model’s reported confidence in the response. 15 Even though we used\nthe cheaper ChatGPT 3.5-turbo for creating this synthetic dataset, the overall cost was roughly\n$600 US dollars. In our main analyses below, we rely on the average response from the 30 synthetic\nrespondents drawn for each human.\n3 Results\nWe evaluate the synthetic data’s quality in three ways. We begin by simply comparing means\nand variances to demonstrate that although ChatGPT appears to perform reasonably well at re-\ncovering overall means, closer inspection reveals that it is often biased and overly confident in\nits approximations of real human survey responses. We then test whether ChatGPT can recover\nmarginal associations between covariates that might be of interest to researchers and find that re-\ngression results estimated using human and synthetic samples often differ, sometimes substantially\nin systematic ways. Finally, we document considerable sensitivity of synthetic responses to both\nthe timing of when a prompt was used to generate data, and also to the persona each prompt\nrepresents.\n14Data collection issues prevented us from getting exactly 30 synthetic respondents for each person (e.g., when\nChatGPT would not format the data correctly). The vast majority of human respondents were paired with exactly\n30 synthetic respondents, and each human respondent was paired with at least 10. We find that these errors were\nsignificantly more likely for political groups (the political parties, liberals and conservatives, and gays & lesbians);\nand for personas that are less educated, unregistered, white, Democrat, male, and less wealthy. However, none of\nthese differences amount to more than one or two missing synthetic samples out of 30. Importantly, we found little\nevidence of these errors being the product of the AI refusing to provide an answer, but were instead due to incorrectly\nformatted tsv results.\n15We use the explanation and the confidence for validation tests of our results presented in our Supporting\nInformation Section 5, testing whether the explanations for a given temperature cohere with the score chosen, and\nwhether the AI reports lower confidence for certain target groups or certain personas than others.\n8\nWe underscore that we selected our empirical setting as a theoretically easy test for ChatGPT.16\nExisting work has documented a western, especially American, bias in the LLM (Cao et al. 2023);\nwe benchmark using one of the most well-known American political opinion surveys; and we specify\nthe precise year that the human respondent participated in the survey, a year prior to the end of\nChatGPT’s training period. Even so, we test the sensitivity of our conclusions to other questions\nand datasets in the Supporting Information, finding significantly worse performance than we doc-\nument in this paper, and supporting our intuition that what follows is something of a best-case\nscenario for synthetic data. Yet even in this best-case scenario, the best we can say is that the\noverall average synthetic responses are close to the population averages. For the kinds of associ-\national questions that social scientists care about, our findings throw cold water on the idea that\nresearchers can substitute synthetic survey data for human respondents.\n3.1 Accuracy of Average and Standard Deviations\nFigure 1 begins by plotting the sample means and standard deviations for the various feeling\nthermometer scores estimated using either the human respondents to the ANES or the average\nof the synthetic respondents drawn from ChatGPT. 17 Because the synthetic data were collected\nto exactly match ANES respondents on the selected covariates, the distributions ideally would be\nidentical.\nWhile the average of ChatGPT responses does not exactly match the average survey response\nin the ANES, every synthetic mean falls within one standard deviation of the ANES average.\nIn addition, the rank ordering of feeling thermometers is largely intact across both samples. That\nsaid, the distribution of synthetic responses for some questions exhibit far less variation than human\nresponses, especially for questions asking about feelings toward racial and religious groups. The\nvariation in the ChatGPT responses also reflects statistical uncertainty due to sampling from the\nunderlying language model,18 so it is striking that these responses are still more tightly distributed\n16Given that ChatGPT has far more parameters than competing models, and LLM performance is known to\nincrease with model size to date (Wei et al. 2022), ChatGPT itself is an easy test for the broader question of how\nwell pretrained LLMs can generate synthetic data.\n17Five of our 16 target groups were not asked in the ANES waves: Hispanic Americans, Democrats, Republicans,\nwomen, and immigrants, although were included in the alternative dataset that we examine in SI Section 6.2.\n18We use a temperature parameter of 1 in our main analysis, and demonstrate the strong positive association\n9\nRepublican Party\nDemocratic Party\nLiberals\nConservatives\nMuslims\nGays and Lesbians\nChristians\nAsian Americans\nBlack Americans\nWhite Americans\nJews\n0 25 50 75 100\nFeeling Thermometer Score\nTarget Group\nData ANES ChatGPT 3.5\nLLM and ANES thermometer comparison\nFigure 1: Average feeling thermometer results (x-axis) for different target groups (y-axis) by prompt\ntype / timing (columns).

To demonstrate, we\nexamine affective polarization and partisan sectarianism, calculating how average opinions toward\nliberals, conservatives, and the major parties vary across groups of respondents defined by race\nand partisanship. Figure 2 presents the results, highlighting the relative extremity of ChatGPT\nresponses, especially among Democrats, that was masked when averaging over partisanship in\nFigure 1. These differences are substantively meaningful, amounting to 0.5–1 standard deviations\nof the ANES distribution of attitudes, and 10–20 points on the 100-point thermometer scale. In\nbetween this hyperparameter and the empirical variance of the synthetic data in SI Section 2.\n10\nparticular, these results suggest that Democrats like liberals more, and conservatives less, than\ntheir human counterparts, exaggerating the out-group antipathy along ideological lines. Similar\nextremism is found among Republicans, especially among non-Hispanic Black Republicans. While\ndifferences in the synthetic and actual responses of independents sometimes occur, there is less\nsystematic evidence of exaggerated polarization in terms of partisanship. In general, the patterns\nreported in Figure 2 highlight that synthetic responses would suggest that society is more politically\nhostile than it actually is.\nDemocrat Independent Republican\nHispanicnon−Hispanic blacknon−Hispanic white\n0 40 80 0 40 80 0 40 80\nRepublican Party\nConservatives\nLiberals\nDemocratic Party\nRepublican Party\nConservatives\nLiberals\nDemocratic Party\nRepublican Party\nConservatives\nLiberals\nDemocratic Party\nFeeling Thermometer Score\nTarget Group\nData ANES ChatGPT 3.5\nLLM and ANES thermometer comparison\nFigure 2: Average feeling thermometer results (x-axis) for different target groups (y-axes) by party\nID of respondent (columns).

Sample sizes for each group-wise comparison are\nidentical.\nFigure 2 also reveals far smaller standard deviations in the synthetic estimates than found in\nthe ANES—ChatGPT does not just exaggerate partisan differences, it is also more confident in this\nconclusion. Beyond the substantive concerns with this over-confidence, the undersized variance of\nsynthetic responses poses serious inferential problems for attempts to use such data for pre-analysis\n11\nstudy design as some scholars have suggested (Argyle et al. 2023). Consider, for example, using\nsynthetic opinions from ChatGPT to conduct a power analysis for a human-respondent test of\nwhether partisan affective polarization has increased since 2012, when the average gap between\nin-party and out-party assessments among partisans in the ANES was 47.4. Table 1 reports the\nresults. Using the estimates of the magnitude and variation in the ChatGPT-generated measures\nof affective polarization, we calculate the sample size required to detect a difference from the 2012\nlevel at various levels of power. As a baseline, we perform the same power calculation using the\nmagnitude and variation in feeling thermometer scores from our ANES comparison set. Even for\n99% power, the ChatGPT estimates imply that just 33 partisan respondents would be necessary to\ndetect a difference from affective polarization in 2012—an underestimation that is almost an order\nof magnitude less than what we calculate from the ANES benchmark. 19\nSample Size Needed\nPower ANES est.

Of course it is possible that the LLM is providing a good estimate of something else\nwith appropriate variation, but we leave that deeper point for future research. Our more limited point is that the\nover-precision of the LLM makes it a possibly misleading tool for guiding the design of human-respondent studies.\nWe include a detailed analysis of variability of the synthetic and human samples in SI Section 9.\n12\n3.2 Accuracy of Estimated Regression Coefficients\nAlthough synthetic data sometimes looks reasonably accurate—albeit too precise—in the aggregate,\nmore concerning problems emerge when looking at conditional relationships. To test whether the\ncorrelational structure of the synthetic data corresponds to the ANES benchmark, we examine\ndifferences in regression results obtained using true and synthetic feeling thermometers as the\ndependent variable. This is a critical test for political science, where scholars are typically interested\nin the correlates of public opinion rather than in broad average values.\nWe estimate linear regression models of the following form:\nFTi,d = α + γId + βββ · xi + λλλ · (Idxi) + ϵi,d, (1)\nwhere i indexes respondents, d indexes data source (ANES or ChatGPT), Id is an indicator for the\ndata source being ChatGPT, and xi is a vector of the respondent characteristic used in our persona\nprompt (age, gender, race, education, income, marital status, ideology, party ID, voter registration\nstatus, and interest in news and politics). We are most interested in the vector of λλλ coefficients\nmeasuring how the partial correlation between each covariate in xi and the feeling thermometer\nscore differs between the synthetic responses and the ANES benchmark.\nWe run the specification in Equation 1 for each combination of feeling thermometer (the 11\ntarget groups in Figure 1) and survey year (2016 or 2020), for 22 total regressions. Figure 3 plots\nthe resulting coefficient estimates estimated using the ANES (x-axis) versus the synthetic data (y-\naxis), broken out by the predictor. Points are shaded based on whether the coefficients estimated\non the synthetic data are significantly different from those estimated on the ANES. Points closer to\nthe 45 degree line indicate a better correspondence between the conclusions an applied researcher\nwould draw using either human or synthetic datasets. Points in the off-diagonal quadrants (upper\nleft and bottom right) are coefficients whose sign differs depending on which data source we employ.\nThe plot highlights the degree to which the synthetic data is influenced by political covariates.\nThe ideology measure performs best, with points lying close to the 45 degree line, many of which\ndo not differ significantly between the datasets. Partisanship also exhibits a strong positive asso-\nciation, although the evidence of an S-shape suggests that the associations between partisanship\nand the battery of feeling thermometers are stronger in the synthetic data than in the human data.\n13\nEstimates from synthetic data\nPartisanship\n−23 0 23\n−23\n0\n23\nIdeology\n−18 0 18\n−18\n0\n18\nEducation\n−3 0 3\n−3\n0\n3\nAge\n−2 0 2\n−2\n0\n2\nRace\n−8 0 8\n−8\n0\n8\nGender\n−4 0 4\n−4\n0\n4\nMarital Status\n−5 0 5\n−5\n0\n5\nIncome\n−1 0 1\n−1\n0\n1\nRegistration\n−4 0 4\n−4\n0\n4\nNews Interest\n−6 0 6\n−6\n0\n6\nEstimates from ANES data\nSig.

The x-axis position is the coefficient estimated in the ANES data, and the y-axis\nposition is the same coefficient estimated in the synthetic data. Solid points indicate coefficients\nwho are significantly different when estimated in either the ANES or synthetic data, while hollow\npoints are coefficients that are not significantly different. Points in the northeast and southwest\nquadrants generate the same substantive interpretations, while those in the northwest and southeast\nquadrants produce differing interpretations. A synthetic dataset that is able to perfectly recover\nrelationships estimated in the ANES data would have all points falling along the 45 degree line.\nConversely, we document far worse performance along other covariates, in several instances leading\nto substantively different conclusions—sometimes with opposite signs—than what we would learn\nfrom the actual ANES.\nOne potential explanation for these results is that the synthetic data is overdetermined by the\n14\npolitical covariates. We demonstrate this point with an analysis of age, comparing and contrasting\nthe results of a bivariate and multiple regression specification run on the ANES and synthetic\ndatasets. The bivariate specification predicts feeling thermometer scores toward the two major\npolitical parties as a function of age:\nFTi,d = α + γId + βagei + λ(Id × agei) + ϵi,d. (2)\nWe compare the estimated marginal effect of age using the ANES data (β) and using the ChatGPT\nresponses (β + λ) from this bivariate specification to the corresponding values from the controlled\nspecification estimated in Equation 1. As above, we run separate regressions for the Democratic\nand Republican Party feeling thermometers in both 2016 and 2020. We plot the marginal effects in\nFigure 4, revealing that not only does the synthetic data produce significantly different relationships\nthan the ANES data in the bivariate specification, it also flips the sign for attitudes towards the\nDemocratic Party in the specification that includes controls.\nThe comparison of the bivariate and multivariate specifications is illuminating. While sampling\nfrom ChatGPT can recover basic relationships between age and feelings towards the major Amer-\nican parties, it does not accurately encode the conditional associations that result in a positive\nrelationship between FT scores and age, all else equal. This shortcoming can be articulated in the\nlanguage of omitted variable bias. Age is correlated with several other characteristics that predict\nGOP support in the United States, such as income (Angel and Settersten Jr 2013), marital status\n(Angel and Settersten Jr 2013; Glenn 1974), and ideological conservativism (Gerber et al. 2010;\nCornelis et al. 2009). These omitted variables generate the spurious conclusion that age “causes”\nwarmer feelings towards the Republican Party and cooler feelings toward the Democratic Party. 20\nIn survey data generated by real humans, conditioning on these other characteristics holds them\nconstant, revealing that—all else equal—older respondents are warmer toward both parties com-\npared to younger Americans. Yet the synthetic data is unable to achieve this degree of nuance,\ninstead reiterating the spurious conclusion of the bivariate regression: the older you are, the less\n20The association between age and conservativism is so wide-spread that it is accompanied by the aphorism that\na conservative 20 year-old doesn’t have a heart, while a liberal thirty year-old doesn’t have a brain, (Peterson et al.\n2020).\n15\nBivariate Multivariate\n20162020\n−4 −2 0 2 4 −4 −2 0 2 4\nDemocratic Party\nRepublican Party\nDemocratic Party\nRepublican Party\nMarginal effect of age (1SD = 17 years) on FT\nFeelings toward the...\nData\nANES\nLLM\nRelationship between respondent age and FT score\nRegression estimates by data\nFigure 4: Coefficients (points) and 95% confidence intervals (bars) describing the relationship\nbetween age and feelings toward the major American political parties, broken out by year (rows)\nand specification (columns).

The bivariate specification (left column) predicts FT scores\nonly as a function of age, concluding that older respondents are more positively oriented toward the\nRepublican party and more negatively oriented toward the Democratic party, a conclusion that is\nrecovered (albeit exaggerated) in the synthetic data. The multivariate specification (right column)\nestimates the same relationship, controlling for all other covariates used to describe the persona to\nthe LLM. While the ANES data indicates no relationship between age and attitudes in 2016 and,\nif anything, a positive association for the Democratic party in 2020, the synthetic data continues\nto produce the same association documented in the bivariate specification.\nwarm you feel toward the Democratic Party.\n4 Sensitivity of Synthetic Responses\nEven in the best-case scenario, synthetic data from ChatGPT has too little variation across re-\nspondents and fails to recover substantively important conditional relationships. In the course of\nour research establishing these problems, we uncovered additional concerns about the reliability\nand replicability of synthetic sampling via ChatGPT. Specifically, we find that the distribution of\nresponses is highly sensitive to differences in the prompt used to generate data, which version of\n16\nChatGPT is used, and even changes over time in the “same” model.\n4.1 Effect of Different Prompts\nHow sensitive are our findings to different prompt specifications? To investigate, we re-collected\nthe synthetic data with two modifications to the description of the persona. The first prompt only\ndescribed the basic demographic profile of the synthetic respondent, including their age, gender,\nrace, marital status, education, and income. The second prompt only included a description of the\nsynthetic respondent’s political characteristics, including their ideology, partisanship, registration\nstatus, and interest in news and politics. The full prompt (the basis of the preceding results)\nincluded all attributes in a single description. The raw code for these prompts is given below,\nwhere the placeholder text is indicated with a capitalized characteristic in square brackets, which\nwould be replaced with a description for the relevant ANES respondent as described above:\n• Demographics only: “It is [YEAR]. You are a [AGE] year-old [MARST] [RACETH] [GENDER]\nwith [EDUCATION] making [INCOME] per year, living in the United States.”\n• Politics only: “It is [YEAR]. You are [IDEO], [REGIS] [PID]who [INTEREST] pays attention\nto what’s going on in government and politics, living in the United States.”\n• Combined: “It is [YEAR]. You are a [AGE] year-old, [MARST], [RACETH] [GENDER] with\n[EDUCATION] making [INCOME] per year, living in the United States. You are [IDEO],\n[REGIS] [PID] who [INTEREST] pays attention to what’s going on in government and poli-\ntics.”\nWe investigate the sensitivity by predicting the mean absolute error (the absolute difference\nbetween the ANES feeling thermometer and the LLM’s estimate) as a function of the prompt\ninteracted with the target group and the party ID, controlling for all other covariates. As illustrated\nin Figure 5, the average absolute error is basically identical between the full prompt and politics-only\nprompt. However, failing to include information on the respondent’s politics dramatically inflates\nthe error for certain groups, notably those groups which are more politically salient (the parties,\nideological groups, gays and lesbians, and Muslims). Political descriptions do not dramatically\n17\nchange the LLM’s errors when it comes to predicting the feeling thermometers toward racial or\nreligious groups, except for Muslims. 21\nDemocrat Independent Republican\n20 30 20 30 20 30\nBlack Americans\nWhite Americans\nAsian Americans\nJews\nChristians\nGays and Lesbians\nMuslims\nConservatives\nDemocratic Party\nLiberals\nRepublican Party\nPredicted MAE\nGroup\nPrompt Demographics only Politics only Combined\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) by prompt\nPrompt sensitivity\nFigure 5: Mean absolute error (MAE, x-axes) associated with different target groups (y-axes) by\npartisanship (columns) for different prompts to generate the synthetic data.

This concern is\nparticularly pertinent to a closed source algorithm like ChatGPT (Spirling 2023). To explore the\nimpact of changes over time we ran a simpler version of our main prompt three times: once in\n21An additional sensitivity test involves the way in which we use pronouns in our prompt. The synthetic data\nused in our main analyses relies on a second-person prompt (“You are a . . . ”). Levendusky and Malhotra (2016)\ndemonstrate that asking humans to imagine being someone else produces exaggerated estimates of polarization. In\nthe SI Section 3, we re-gather synthetic data using a first-person prompt (“I am a . . . ”), finding less evidence of\nexaggerated polarization, although worse overall performance in terms of mean absolute error.\n18\nApril 2023, once in June 2023, and then again in July 2023. 22 In the interim between our June\nand July runs, OpenAI upgraded its default 3.5 Turbo version of ChatGPT on June 25, 2023,\npromising that the original will be accessible until September 2023. These three snapshots of the\nsynthetic data allow us to characterize the degree to which such data is “reproducible”, which\nwe define in two ways. First, is a researcher able to exactly recover the same dataset over time?\nSecond, is the researcher able to produce a substantively similar dataset, meaning that conclusions\ndrawn from it would persist, even if the cell-by-cell values change? 23 These questions speak to the\nbroader concern over how much the largely opaque decisions of for-profit private companies affect\nreplication.\nTo test this, we compare our results from the April 2023 data to the June and July 2023 runs\nof the identical prompt. We plot the April results on the x-axis in Figure 6 and the June and July\nresults on the y-axes. Each point is the count of human-synthetic observations that share a given\nApril-June/July coordinate FT score, aggregating over all target groups. Perfect replication would\nproduce a 45-degree line, which we indicate with a dashed red line.\nNeither re-collection of our data – using an identical prompt – exactly reproduces our original\nsynthetic data. However, the July sample is substantially tempered, with the coldest thermometer\nscores from April increasing and, to a lesser degree, the warmest scores from April declining.\nMeanwhile the June sample, although it exhibits similar patterns, is not significantly different from\na placebo test in which we randomly sample 10 synthetic responses from the April results and\ntreat these as a pseudo-new sample, reflecting mean reversion. The two facets of Figure 6 capture\nthe two sources of variation in synthetic data generated by closed-source LLMs. The left panel\nhighlights that, without the ability of researchers to effectively set a seed for the random number\n22This prompt was based on our original submission and it did not include descriptions of the respondent’s ideology,\nregistration status, or interest in news and politics, and only specified that they were living in the United States in\n2019. In addition, we only collected 20 synthetic respondents per persona, instead of 30 per individual human\nrespondent, and we did not record explanations or the confidence in the output. Finally, our June 2023 run of the\nprompt faced a change in the formatting of the ChatGPT response which meant we did not record any data for one\nof the target groups. A detailed description of this prompt is included in the SI Section 1.\n23In investigating these questions, we speak to recent unpublished work which suggests that ChatGPT 4 is getting\nworse over time, while 3.5 is getting better (Chen et al. 2023), although there is some debate over whether this\nanalysis reveals changes in the LLM’s capabilities or merely in its behaviors (Narayanan and Kapoor 2023).\n19\ny = 4.5+ 0.93 x y = 19 + 0.75 x\nJune Data July Data\n0 25 50 75 100 0 25 50 75 100\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nApril Data\nSubsequent Data\n# samples 1000 2000 3000 4000\nDifference between April and subsequent vintages\nReplication scatterplot\nFigure 6: Reproducibility of synthetic data over time.

Each point indicates the number of observations\nassociated with April vs later synthetic datasets, aggregating across respondents and target groups.\nLinear regression equation indicated in top-left of both facets, revealing substantially attenuated\ndifferences between the April and July runs of the same prompt.\ngenerator, exactly replicating synthetic data is impossible. More concerningly, the right panel\nhighlights the vulnerability of academic norms of replication to the opaque decisions of for-profit\nprivate companies. While we still have access to the original version of the ChatGPT 3.5-turbo\nendpoint that produced our April data at the time of writing, OpenAI has notified its users that\nthis will no longer be available by September of 2023, meaning that whatever conclusions were\ndrawn on this initial sample cannot be reproduced. 24\nMore generally, the sensitivity we document along the dimensions of prompt engineering and\ntiming raises concerns for the use of synthetic data for social science research in two ways. First is\nthe issue of reproducibility. While journals might accept the argument that synthetic samples should\n24We document the original findings of an earlier draft of this manuscript in the Supporting Information Section\n6, for posterity.\n20\nnot be held to higher standards of recreation than human samples, the fact that we find signed\ndifferences over time is troubling, especially given that we don’t know whether the compression\nwe document is mean reversion or intentional. Second is the issue of prompt sensitivity, which\nwe worry is at the top of a slippery slope of p-hacking if synthetic datasets become acceptable\nfor scholarly research. Given the speed and low costs of creating these data, researchers might be\ntempted to keep trying different prompts until they assemble the synthetic dataset that generates\nthe results they want. For both of these reasons, we argue that the promise of synthetic data is\ngreatly overstated.\n4.3 New and Improved Models?\nDespite the evidence presented in this paper, one might hope that there is a future for cheap\nsynthetic data as these models improve. Perhaps the shortcomings we document above are just the\ngrowing pains of a sophisticated language model that will one day allow researchers to evaluate social\nscience research questions at a fraction of the cost. We test this claim by comparing the synthetic\ndata generated by ChatGPT 3.5 against the same prompt run using ChatGPT 4.0, finding little\nsupport for this optimism.\nFigure 7 summarizes the updated AI’s performance in terms of basic correlations with the ANES\ndata, relative to version 3.5, revealing no improvement. If anything, ChatGPT 4.0 is slightly worse\noverall, with a higher y-intercept (suggesting bias away from the most negative feeling thermometer\nassessments) and a slightly shallower slope (ideally this would be a one-to-one match with perfect\nsynthetic data). These basic patterns are supported in a replication of the analyses above (found in\nSI Section 11) which demonstrates that ChatGPT 4.0 is a toss-up relative to 3.5 in terms of mean\nabsolute error; continues to generate synthetic samples with smaller deviations from the human\nsample when predicting feeling thermometers toward ideological groups, but larger deviations when\npredicting feelings toward parties; and still appears to be overdetermined by partisanship, neglecting\nmore complex conditional relationships, such as age. On net, despite its substantially larger size\nand demonstrated superior performance across a range of tasks [CITE], our analysis suggests that\nimprovements in ChatGPT’s underlying language model have not increased its ability to generate\nsynthetic data.\nWe sympathize with growing concerns about the reproducibility of research performed with\n21\nG PT3.5 :y = 22 + 0.64 x\nG PT4.0 :y = 30 + 0.58 x\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n0 25 50 75 100\nANES FT Score\nLLM FT Score\n# samples\n250\n500\n750\nVersion\nGPT3.5\nGPT4.0\nANES versus two versions of ChatGPT\nFigure 7: Scatterplot of human feelings toward various outgroups (x-axis) against their associated\nsynthetic samples generated with ChatGPT 3.5-turbo (solid blue line) or ChatGPT 4.0 (dashed\nblue line). Points sized by the number of respondents associated with each pair of scores.\nproprietary models (Spirling 2023), so we also replicated our work using the open source Falcon-\n40B-Instruct LLM. 25 This was the most powerful open source LLM at the time we began our\nresearch,26 yet we find the same major issues as with ChatGPT. There is considerably less variability\nin synthetic respondents’ feelings toward the two major parties than in the ANES benchmark,\nand there are numerous (statistically and substantively) significant differences between the partial\ncorrelations we would estimate with the Falcon data and those from the survey of real humans.\n5 Discussion and Implications\nHuman subjects are expensive and complicated. If scholars could replace them with LLM-based\nsynthetic subjects, they could much more easily collect information on public opinion, pretest survey\nquestions, substitute the need to actually reach hard-to-reach populations, try out experimental\ndesigns, and so on. The allure of closed-source LLMs like ChatGPT is the ability to quickly and\n25Full details in Supporting Information Section 14.\n26It has since been overtaken by Meta’s Llama-70B.\n22\ncheaply obtain data without dealing with the many complications and ethical considerations that\nare associated with human subject research. The fact that LLMs do a remarkably good job at\nrecovering average responses given by broad groups of respondents in the ANES makes their use\nall the more tempting. However, we find evidence of several troubling patterns that raise serious\nconcerns about the use of LLMs as a substitute for characterizing public opinion. Not only is\nprecision often excessively high – raising issues with using synthetic responses for power analyses\nand research design – but the complex interdependencies present among human respondents are\nnot captured well by synthetic responses. This subtle problem can lead to misleading inferences,\nsometimes even with the wrong sign. In principle an LLM could be developed or trained to perform\nbetter on the counts of precision and conditional relationships but to date new versions have not\ndone so.\nThese results confirm and expand upon the demonstrated limitations that occur when using\nLLMs to learn about humans. Others have argued that LLMs’ understanding of humanity is\nbiased in myriad ways: toward western culture (Washington Post 2023; Cao et al. 2023), toward\na progressive sensibility (Motoki et al. 2023; Rozado 2023), and toward a set of personality traits\ncurrently reified in the same culture (Rutinowski et al. 2023; Abdulhai et al. 2023; Cao et al. 2023).\nIn line with these results, Section 4 of the appendix confirms that prompting ChatGPT to adopt the\npersona of an “average” voter or citizen produces responses that are closer to those of Democrats\nthan Republicans. But our contribution is more general in its conclusion that LLMs are unlikely to\nprovide a cheap alternative to human survey data in the near future, and perhaps ever. Although\nwe focus our analysis on ChatGPT, the current best-in-class version of this new technology, we\nshow that open-source versions perform even worse in SI Section 14. Furthermore, our results are\nbased on what we argue is the lowest hanging fruit for the algorithm to generate plausible synthetic\nsamples. When we attempt to replicate our results using the same questions in a national online\nsurvey, or using other items in other surveys, or even using other items in surveys conducted in\nother countries, the performance is even frequently worse than we document here (see SI Sections\n12 and 13).27\n27We recognize that treating any sample as a baseline comparison assumes a high level of accuracy about that\nsample. As discussed in the introduction, the growing crisis in public opinion polling raises questions about whether\nthis assumption is valid. Perhaps the synthetic data are closer to the unknown population parameters of interest, and\n23\nDoes this mean that the promise of synthetic samples produced by a sophisticated AI will never\nmaterialize? We find little evidence that ChatGPT 4.0, at almost 6 times the size of its predecessor,\nrepresents a meaningful improvement when it comes to synthetic survey data generation. But\nperhaps some future version of this technology may one day be able to recover not just basic averages\nand standard deviations, but also partial associations of interest to researchers. Furthermore, there\nmay be examples of carefully tailored synthetic samples where scholars are able to overcome the\nlimitations we document above, and we can see the value of these applications to impute missing\ndata or to ensure data privacy when making replication materials public. However, without more\nrobust insulation against prompt engineering, which can make the synthetic data draw any number\nof conclusions, the widespread use of synthetic data as a replacement for human-generated surveys\nseems unlikely.28\nThe focus of our analyses has been on the practical issue of the quality of synthetic data. We\nhighlight a number of problems with this data source which could lead researchers to draw erroneous\nconclusions about real human respondents if they were to use it. We want to conclude with a\ncomment about another dimension along which synthetic data from LLMs can be evaluated. The\nethics of replacing human opinion with synthetic opinion generated from unknown and unknowable\nmethods seem tenuous at best. Relying on predictions generated by an unknown corpus and using\na model with unknown assumptions as a substitute for asking humans how they think and feel\nabout the world around them seems contrary to the origins and importance of polling itself. Polls\nare intended to check political power and track how opinions change over time and vary between\ngroups. To remove humans from the equation and rely on existing content to extrapolate opinions\nhard-wires the past into the present. Crucially, it also relies on the voices of the content’s creators\nto characterize the voices of others. Removing or reducing the centrality of humanity from social\nscience and focusing on the black-boxed output of an LLM shifts our attention from characterizing\nand learning about the opinions and behavior of human beings – however imperfect and complicated\nthose efforts may be – to studying outputs from an algorithm whose relationship to humanity is\nthe human data is flawed by non-ignorable non-response. However, short of designing and fielding a survey of human\nrespondents that overcomes the challenges that the $14 million ANES cannot, this argument seems untestable and,\nif true, calls into question decades of public opinion research.\n28This indictment doesn’t consider other dimensions of concern described in Bender et al. (2021) and Spirling\n(2023).\n24\nmostly unknown and, as we show in this study, unable to reproduce the nuances of human beliefs\nthat are of foundational interest to social science.\n25\nReferences\nM.

We initially tried\nsimply asking the LLM to imagine that they were a certain persona and to answer questions.\nThis produced results that were both difficult to process (open-ended text results) as well as often\nresulting in the LLM’s refusal to provide the answers requested. We found that using the instruction\n“Provide responses from this person’s perspective. Use only knowledge about politics that they\nwould have.” helped avoid refusals by the AI, although the resulting output remained open-ended\nand hard to process. We then provided more detailed instructions about the format of the output\nrequested, describing the the desired .csv format where each row corresponded to a given target\ngroup, and the columns included the name of the group and the synthetic thermometer score.\nThe code that produced the resulting prompt for our initial synthetic data was used in early\nApril of 2023, and is reproduced below. We relied on the openai package for R and described the\npersona along the dimensions of age, race, gender, income ( inc), education ( educ), and party ID\n(pid). All persona were defined as registered voters who lived in the United States in 2019.

In each case, there were rare instances in which\neither the code or the API experienced an issue that prevented us from gathering the data for a\ngiven target group-by-persona. In most cases, these were random with respect to our quantities of\ninterest. In one case though, there were systematically more issues with our synthetic responses for\nthe Democratic Party. This was due to the fact that we asked about this group first in the list of\ntarget groups, meaning it would occupy the first row in the resulting csv/tsv file. 1 In some cases,\n1We initially requested the results in .csv format, but found that this would create issues with the detailed version\nof the prompt that asked for explanations, since these would often include commas. As such, we switched to the tsv\n6\nthis first row would not include a header, meaning that we treated the response for the Democratic\nParty target group as the header and lost it. These issues were rare enough in the initial April run\nof the script that we did not notice the issue until later. However, the June iteration of the same\nprompt yielded many errors of this type, but – perplexingly – only for the prompts for Democrat and\nIndependent personas. The Republican persona was far more likely to include the header row and\navoid the issue. We fixed the issue in subsequent runs of the API, and drop the Democratic Party\nresults from all analyses of the June vintage of our data. We plot the API errors below in Figure\n1 by party, target group, and vintage, highlighting that, with the exception of the aforementioned\nissue with the Democratic Party target group, there is little evidence to make us concerned that\nerrors in data collection are non-randomly associated with the target groups or persona profiles.\nEven in cases where we observe larger proportions missing, these never exceed 1.15% of the intended\nsynthetic sample size. In most cases, missingness amounts to a single synthetic sample out of the\n20 intended to be gathered for a given persona for a given target group.\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.04%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n99%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n99%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n3.83%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.04%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.04%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.04%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.04%\n0.04%\n0.04%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.04%\n0.1%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.12%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.14%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.05%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.09%\n1.14%\n0.09%\n0.07%\n0.05%\n0.05%\n0.07%\n0.05%\n0.05%\n0.09%\n0.05%\n0.05%\n0.07%\n0.02%\n0.22%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.02%\n0.1%\n0.05%\n0.07%\n0.1%\n0.12%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.1%\n0.1%\n0.1%\n0.07%\n0.12%\n0.1%\n0.07%\n0.07%\n0.07%\nSimple (April) Simple (June) Simple (July) First−Person (June)\nDemocrat\nIndependentRepublican Democrat\nIndependentRepublican Democrat\nIndependentRepublican Democrat\nIndependentRepublican\nGays and Lesbians\nLiberals\nRepublicans\nBlack Americans\nDemocrats\nMuslims\nRepublican Party\nWhite Americans\nJews\nChristians\nConservatives\nHispanic Americans\nImmigrants\nWomen\nAsian Americans\nDemocratic Party\nParty ID (persona)\nTarget Group\n% of all synthetic samples expected\nMissing synthetic data\nFigure 1: Proportion of missing synthetic responses by target group (y-axes), synthetic party ID\n(x-axes) and vintage of data collection / prompt type (columns).\nIn June, we also re-ran the preceding prompt replacing second-person pronouns with first-\nperson pronouns at the suggestion of a reviewer who pointed out that human respondents believe\nout-groups hold more extreme views than they actually do [Levendusky and Malhotra, 2016]. It is\npossible therefore that ChatGPT inherits this second-person bias, exaggerating extremism not via\nany particular limitation of the technology, but rather by accurately reflecting how humans perceive\npolarization. The revised first-person prompt is copied below (note that the only difference between\nthe original prompt and the first person is found in the system parameter, and we save space by\nonly copying the adjusted language).\n1 list (\n2 list (\n3 \" role \" = \" system \",\nformat in June.\n7\n4 \" content \" = stringr :: str_c (\n5 \"I am a \",age ,\" year old \",race ,\" \",gender ,\n6 \" with a \",educ ,\", earning $\",inc ,\" per year . \",\n7 \"I am a registered \",pid ,\" living in the USA in 2019. \")\n8 ),\n9 list (\n10 \" role \" = \" user \",\n11 \" content \" = stringr :: str_c (\n12 \" Provide responses to the following questions .\\n\n13 Format the output as a csv table with the following format :\\n\n14 group , thermometer \\n\n15 The following questions ask about individuals ' feelings toward\ndifferent groups .\\n\n16 Responses should be given on a scale from 0 ( meaning cold\nfeelings ) to 100 ( meaning warm feelings ).\\n\n17 Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that \\n\n18 you feel favorable and warm toward the group .

This prompt operated slightly differently\nfrom the preceding, although the core components remained. Specifically, we used this prompt to\ncollect 30 synthetic respondents per human, not per persona. In addition, we also asked the AI to\nprovide both an explanation for its response, as well as a numeric measure of its confidence in its\nresponse.\nThe inclusion of an explanation, although significantly more expensive, was based on an anony-\nmous reviewer’s observation that restricting the LLM to provide only numbers may hurt its perfor-\nmance, since numbers live in a similar part of the embedding space. The inclusion of a confidence\nmeasure was also based on reviewer feedback, who wondered whether we could actually measure\nthe posterior probability of the thermometer score chosen. We analyze both of these additional\n8\npieces of information in more detail below. In SI Section 5 below, we use NLP on the open-ended\nexplanations provided by ChatGPT to validate the numeric thermometer scores that were provided\nby showing that the explanations for two responses that are closer together numerically, are also\nmore similar in terms of their language. And in SI Section 9.3 below, we investigate the relation-\nship between the empirical uncertainty across 30 synthetic respondents for a given human, and the\n“self-reported” confidence of the LLM when it generated those numbers.\nThe prompt for the open-ended response is reproduced below. (Note that the code has been\nrefined for greater legibility. We now generate the system prompt with a simple gsub() command\nthat flies in the relevant characteristics directly from the ANES respondent.)\n1 full <- \"It is [ YEAR ].

In addition, we re-ran a smaller version of the prompt in July of 2023, using ChatGPT\n4.0. To reduce expenses associated with the more costly GPT 4.0 endpoint, we only collected\none synthetic response per human, and only queried four target groups: Democrats, Republicans,\nLiberals, and Conservatives. Data missingness in the detailed prompt using ChatGPT 3.5 again\ndoes not appear to 3.5 be correlated with a particular group or persona, with the exception of the\nDemocratic (and, to a lesser extent, Republican) party (see Figure 2). Missingness in the GPT 4\nversion amounts to 11 missing human respondents without a synthetic counterpart at all, and –\namong those with a synthetic counterpart – no missing responses for the Republican Party target\ngroup, one missing response for the liberal group, six missing responses for the conservative group,\nand 22 missing responses for the Democratic Party target group.\nFinally, we used a modified version of the simpler prompt to evaluate the performance of\nChatGPT 3.5 on the 2016 ISSP dataset. Here, we only describe the human persona in terms of\ntheir age, marital status, gender, education, and the country in which they lived. As above, we\ninstructed the LLM to adopt the persona’s perspective, provide only the numeric response for each\nquestion, and described the Likert scale as it appeared in the original survey.

Main results are based on the “Detailed 3.5” prompt,\nwhere we calculated the synthetic data’s per-human response using the average of its 30 draws.\nThere is little evidence of our prompts failing to generate estimates in a systematic manner,\nbeyond the issues produced by our code.\n14\n2 Temperature and “creativity”\nIn the context of ChatGPT, “temperature” refers to how deterministic the choice of the subsequent\ntoken in its output is, conditional on the prompt and the preceding tokens. Each subsequent token\nis chosen from a probability distribution across tokens. A temperature setting of zero means that\nthe AI will always choose the most likely subsequent token. As temperature rises, the selection from\nthis distribution grows less deterministic, which is often colloquially referred to as “creativity”.\nOur main results are generated by ChatGPT at its most “creative”, meaning that the tempera-\nture hyperparameter was set to 1. 2 In theory, these results should be the noisiest and, potentially,\nthe most representative of the actual randomness in human survey responses. As we demonstrated\nin the paper, even at this temperature setting, the ChatGPT estimates were far more precise than\nthose found among ANES respondents. On average, LLM estimates were only 40% as variable as\ntheir ANES counterparts.\nNote that this number combines two sources of variation. The first is the variation stem-\nming from averaging across different groups. For example, the LLM’s standard deviations for the\nparty-by-race results incorporated variation stemming from other covariates such as age, gender,\neducational attainment, and income. The second is the inherent randomness of the data generating\nprocess. Among humans, this is a reflection of all our quirks that aren’t captured by covariates.\nIn the LLM, it is a characteristic of the model, which can be partially tweaked by the temperature\nparameter.\nWith this in mind, how much worse does this overconfidence grow if we reduce the creativity?\nTo investigate, we calculated the standard deviation for each target group for each profile in the\nLLM data by temperature settings ranging from 0.1 to 1, using the original “simple” prompt from\nApril. We plot the averages of these measures of variance in Figure 3, illustrating how much less\nuncertain our measures would have been had we reduced the temperature parameter. In all cases,\nwe highlight that reducing the temperature value (x-axes) reduces the average standard deviation\n(y-axes) across target groups (rows), regardless of how coarse or how granular our aggregation of\nthe personas is (columns).\n2Technically, the temperature hyperparameter can go even higher than 1. However, in testing we found that\nexceeding the value of 1 produced either gibberish results, or results that were no longer formatted as requested to\naid data extraction.\n15\nPID alone PID by Race PID by Race\nby Age\nPID by Race\nby Age by Educ\nPID by Race\nby Age by Educ\nby Gender\nPID by Race\nby Age by Educ\nby Gender by Income\nPID by Race\nby Age by Educ\nby Gender by Income\nby Marital\nBlacksChristiansDemocratsMuslimsRepublicansWhites\n0.250.500.751.00 0.250.500.751.00 0.250.500.751.00 0.250.500.751.00 0.250.500.751.00 0.250.500.751.00 0.250.500.751.00\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\n7.5\n10.0\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\n7.5\n10.0\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\n7.5\n10.0\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\n7.5\n10.0\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\n7.5\n10.0\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\n7.5\n10.0\nCreativity\nAverage of Standard Deviation Across Personas\nFigure 3: Relationship between temperature hyperparameter (x-axes) and average standard devi-\nation of attitudes (y-axes) by target group (rows) and level of persona aggregation (columns).\n16\n3 First-person and second-person prompts\nOur main results find that ChatGPT exaggerates polarization in the United States in 2019, com-\npared to actual human survey respondents to the 2016 and 2020 ANES waves. However, existing\nwork demonstrates that human respondents believe out-groups hold more extreme views than they\nactually do [Levendusky and Malhotra, 2016]. It is possible therefore that ChatGPT inherits this\nsecond-person bias, exaggerating extremism not via any particular limitation of the technology, but\nrather by accurately reflecting how humans perceive polarization. As such, we re-ran our prompt\non July 5th, 2023 where we instructed ChatGPT with first-person descriptions (i.e. “I am a 24 year\nold white male with a college degree earning $50,000 per year.” See the full prompt description in\nSI Section 1 above.).\nConsistent with expectations, we find attenuated evidence of exaggerated affective polarization\nwhen using the first-person prompt (see Figure 4). In particular, we no longer observe more negative\nattitudes toward out-group ideologues. In addition, at least among synthetic Democrats, the first-\nperson prompt yields greater accuracy in three of the four comparisons to the ANES estimate\n(the exception being synthetic Democrats’ attitudes toward the Republican Party). However, the\nfirst-person prompt is less accurate in almost every other comparison.\nAlthough the evidence of exaggerated polarization is attenuated with the first person prompt,\nthis does not mean that a first person prompt performs better. As illustrated in Figure 5, the mean\nabsolute error for the first person prompt is larger than the original prompt for all target groups\nexcept liberals and Muslims, and this pattern is even worse for the first person prompt when we\ncompare it to the July run of the original prompt.\nA final note on the question of first- versus second-person pronouns is that the vast majority\nof explanations that were recorded with the detailed prompt – which used second-person pronouns\nto describe the persona to the LLM – were expressed in the first-person. In other words, even\nthough ChatGPT was prompted with “You are a...”, it replied with “I”, suggesting that it is able\nto better inhabit the persona suggested than the humans documented in Levendusky and Malhotra\n[2016], who were asked to indicate what they thought a “typical Democrat voter would want” (i.e.,\na third-person prompt).\n17\nDemocrat Independent Republican\nIdeologyParty\n0 25 50 75 100 20 40 60 0 25 50 75 100\nLiberals\nConservatives\nRepublican Party\nDemocratic Party\nAverage Feeling Thermometer\nTarget group\nData\nANES\nLLM_FP\nLLM_OG\nPersona partisanship in columns\nLLM and ANES feeling thermometer comparison\nFigure 4: Average feeling thermometer (x-axes) toward political target groups (y-axes) by synthetic\nparty ID (columns) and data type (red triangles are human respondents measured in the ANES,\nsolid black points are synthetic responses measured using the simple prompt in April 2023, and\nhollow points are synthetic responses measured using the first-person variant of the simple prompt,\nmeasured in June).\n18\nWhite Americans\nAsian Americans\nBlack Americans\nJews\nMuslims\nChristians\nConservatives\nLiberals\nGays and Lesbians\nRepublican Party\nDemocratic Party\n18 20 22 24\nMean absolute error\nTarget group\nVs April 2023 run of original prompt\nFirst person prompt MAE\n18 20 22 24\nMean absolute error\nVs July 2023 run of original prompt\nPrompt First person Original\nFigure 5: Mean absolute error (x-axes) measuring the average absolute difference between human\nrespondents in the ANES and their synthetic counterparts produced by either the first person\nversion of the simple prompt (black circles) or the second-person version of the simple prompt\n(hollow circles) by target group (y-axes). Columns indicate whether the second-person version of\nthe simple prompt was collected in April or July of 2023.\n19\n4 Replication\nWe document evidence of variation over time in our manuscript, suggesting that the July run of\nthe simple prompt produced less extreme measures compared to the initial April version of the\ndata. Here, we investigate this comparison in more detail, starting with a summary measure of the\nchange in thermometer scores. Aggregating over all profiles and all target groups, we find that the\nJuly 2023 vintage data is less negative overall compared to the April 2023 vintage data. Figure\n6 displays the histogram of the difference between the April and July versions of the data, where\nnegative values indicate that the July values are larger than their corresponding April values. As\nillustrated, 48% of observations were higher in July than in April, compared to only 27% being\nhigher in April. Furthermore the magnitude of these differences is quite large, ranging up to 50\nfeeling thermometer points on the scale from 0 to 100.\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n−50 −25 0 25 50\nApril − July\nNumber of respondents−by−target groups\nApril FT scores minus July FT scores for the same prompt\nReplication evaluation\nFigure 6: Difference in synthetic estimates of feeling thermometers between the April and July\n2023 vintages of the simple prompt.\nIn our main results, we show that this increase in warmth is driven primarily by the coolest\nthermometer scores recorded in the April vintage data. Below, we calculate these scatter plots\nfor all target groups, illustrating that the big picture compression is not driven by any particular\ntarget group (see Figure 7).\nHowever, even here these patterns mask how weak the association is once we remove party. We\nreproduce the same plot once more but calculate the associations for Democrats, Independents,\nand Republicans separately.

From this analysis, it would appear that the evidence\nof moderation in the aggregate data is more a function of weak or zero correlations than of an\nactual reduction in extremism. Put differently, Figure 8 further confirms our conclusion that the\nsynthetic data is driven primarily by politics.\n21\nMuslims Republican Party White Americans\nDemocratic Party Gays and Lesbians Jews Liberals\nAsian Americans Black Americans Christians Conservatives\n0 25 50 75 100 0 25 50 75 100 0 25 50 75 100\n0 25 50 75 100\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nApril\nJuly\nParty\nDemocrat\nIndependent\nRepublican\nn\n200\n400\n600\nApril vs July FT scores by target group and Partisanship\nReplication scatterplot\nFigure 8: Feeling thermometer scores for the April (x-axes) and July (y-axes) vintages of the simple\nprompt, broken out by target group (facets) and party ID of synthetic respondents (blue circles are\nDemocrats, grey circles are Independents, and red circles are Republicans).\n22\n5 Validation\nOur main results relied on ChatGPT’s numeric responses to a prompt about expressing feelings\nin terms of numbers between zero and 100. However, numbers may be a more difficult unit for a\nlanguage model to produce, since they exist in a similar embedding space, meaning that the LLM\nis more likely to draw from them at random. This is due to the fact that tokens in close proximity\nin the embedding space are also proximate in terms of their posterior probability. To the extent\nthat this is a concern, the fact we do observe consistent patterns across covariates is reassuring.\nNevertheless it is worthwhile to validate these values.\nTo do so, we prompted ChatGPT to provide a short explanation for why it chose the feeling\nthermometer number it did. There was surprising consistency in these explanations, to the extent\nthat we can document the correlation between a truncated version of the explanation (removing\nreferences to a particular group and non-alphanumeric characters) and the feeling thermometer\nscore. Figure 9 plots the most commonly occurring explanations (those that are used 100 or more\ntimes) and their associated feeling thermometers, sizing points by the number of instances of each\nexplanation-FT score pair.\nThe plot provides very reassuring validation of the numeric feeling thermometer scores in two\nways. First, a cursory glance at the y-axis highlights that explanations associated with warmer and\ncolder FT scores are sensible (“i have a very warm feeling”, “i feel very favorable” etc. for higher\nscores; “i do not feel favorably”, “i have very negative feelings”, “i strongly disagree with their\npolicies and beliefs” etc. for lower scores). Second, there is much more consistency vertically than\nhorizontally, meaning that a given explanation is only associated with a handful of clustered FT\nscores, whereas a single FT score might have several different types of explanations. The exceptions\nto this latter pattern are also intuitive. We document a wider range of FT scores associated with\n“i don’t feel particularly warm or cold” and “i have mixed feelings” than the scores associated with\n“i have very negative feelings” and “i feel very warmly”.\nTo more robustly validate the feeling thermometer scores produced by ChatGPT, we pursue\nthree different extensions. First, we use LDA [Blei et al., 2003] to generate topics for each explana-\ntion. We estimate 30 topics ( k) using both unigrams and bi-grams on the explanations, producing\na matrix of document-topic weights θd,k describing how likely it is that explanation d is about\ntopic k, as well as a matrix of word-topic weights ϕw,k that describe how likely it is that word w is\nassociated with topic k. We use these values to calculate the weighted average feeling thermometer\nscore per topic by weighting each synthetic response by the topic distribution θ across documents\n(explanations). Formally:\nAvg FT scorek =\nX\nd\nθd,k ∗ FT scored (1)\nAs illustrated in Figure 10, there is a reasonable association between the topics (indicated on the\ny-axis by the top 5 most associated words, determined by the ϕ word-topic distribution) and the\nfeeling thermometer scores most commonly found in the explanations that are more heavily asso-\nciated with the topics. For example, the warmest feeling thermometer scores are those associated\nwith the topic concerning equal rights and support for members of the LGBTQ+ community when\nused by Democrats. Conversely, the coldest topic is described by terms like “disagree” and “cold”,\nas well as the bigram “disagree policies”. Interestingly, the topic associated with conservatives\n(“conservatives”, “towards conservatives”, “values”, “conservative”, “government”) is associated\nwith cold FT scores among Democrats, but warm FT scores among Republicans.\nSecond, we use a BERT transformer to embed these explanations in semantic space, producing\nnumeric representations of each explanation in a 768-dimension vector. If the AI is using feeling\nthermometer numbers accurately, we would expect that the difference between the explanations\n23\ni strongly disagree with their policies and beliefsi have very negative feelingsi have very cold feelingsi feel coldi do not feel favorablyi dont have favorable feelingsi dont agree with their policies and valuesi dont feel favorablei have negative feelingsi dont feel favorable or warmi do not feel favorablei have cold feelingsi do not have warm feelingsi generally have negative feelingsi do not have favorable feelingsi dont feel favorablyi have generally negative feelingsi dont feel very favorablei generally have cold feelingsi dont have warm feelingsi dont feel particularly warmi have some negative feelingsi feel somewhat coldi dont have particularly warm feelingsi have somewhat cold feelingsi dont feel particularly favorablei dont feel particularly favorable or warmi dont feel particularly warm or favorablei have mixed feelingsi do not have particularly warm or cold feelingsi have lukewarm feelingsi dont feel particularly warm or coldi do not feel particularly warm or coldi am neutrali dont particularly feel warm or coldi dont have strong positive or negative feelingsi dont have strong feelingsi dont have any strong feelingsi dont have particularly strong feelingsi dont have strong feelings either wayi dont have strong feelings one way or the otheri dont have any particular feelingsi feel neutrali generally have neutral feelingsi have neutral feelingsi feel somewhat neutrali do not have strong feelingsi dont have particularly warm or cold feelingsi do not have any strong feelingsi do not have particularly strong feelingsi generally feel neutrali dont have any particularly strong feelingsi feel somewhat warmi feel somewhat favorablei have no particular feelingsi have no strong feelingsi dont have any negative feelingsi feel moderately warmi feel somewhat favorable and warmi have slightly warm feelingsi feel relatively warmi feel fairly warmi generally have positive feelingsi have somewhat warm feelingsi have generally positive feelingsi have positive feelingsi generally agree with their policies and valuesi generally feel positivelyi have warm feelingsi have generally warm feelingsi feel favorablyi feel generally favorablei feel generally warmi generally feel favorablyi generally feel warm and favorablei generally have warm feelingsi feel warmi generally feel warmi generally feel favorablei generally feel favorable and warmi have generally favorable feelingsi generally have favorable feelingsi feel favorable and warmas a christian myself i have warm feelingsi generally have warm and favorable feelingsi feel warm and favorablei have favorable and warm feelingsi have favorable feelingsi feel favorablei feel warmlyi feel positivelyi have warm and favorable feelingsi have a warm feelingi hold warm feelingsi have a favorable and warm feelingi feel very warm and favorablei feel very favorablei feel very favorable and warmi feel very positivelyi have a warm and favorable feelingi have warm and positive feelingsi feel very warmi have very warm feelingsi have very warm and favorable feelingsi feel very warmlyi feel very favorablyi have a very warm feelingi am a registered democrat and have warm feelings\n0 25 50 75 100\nFeeling thermometer score\nTruncated explanation\nn\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nTruncated explanations with more than 70\nExplanations and FT scores\nFigure 9: Feeling thermometer scores (x-axis) by truncated explanation (y-axis).\nassociated with a 10 score and a 20 score are similar to those between an 80 and a 90 score,\nand that these are both smaller than the differences between a 10 score and an 80 score.

First, we calculate the average vector representation for each feeling thermometer\nscore-by-target group-by-sociodemographic profile (dropping rarely occurring FT scores which turn\nout to be those not rounded to 5 unit increments). Then, after calculating the cosine distance for all\nvector representations, we then collapse the data once again to the average cosine distance for each\nfeeling thermometer distance-by-party ID. Figure 11 visualizes the results with the difference in\nfeeling thermometer responses on the x-axes and cosine distances between the vector representations\non the y-axes, with each facet indicating a target group-by-party ID.\nAs illustrated, the plots trend upward in almost every facet, albeit never linearly, indicating that\nnumeric feeling thermometer responses which are further apart are accompanied by explanations\nwhich are similarly further apart in semantic space. For reference, an example of two explanations\nthat are far apart in semantic space are “I feel warm toward Christians. I strongly identify as\na Christian and believe in their values and teachings.” (FT score = 90) versus “I feel very cold\ntoward the Democratic Party. They do not represent my values, and I disagree with their policies.”\n(FT score = 0). This Euclidean distance between their thermometer scores of 90 corresponds to a\ncosine distance between their vector representations of roughly 0.81 on a support ranging between\n0 (semantically the same) to 1 (semantically totally dissimilar).\nFinally, we use ChatGPT itself to assist us in annotating a random sample of 2,000 pairs of\nexplanations.3 In each comparison, we ask ChatGPT 3.5 to indicate which explanation justifies a\nwarmer evaluation of some group. We then compare these labels to the true difference in FT scores,\n3This idea was inspired by Wu et al.

Furthermore, Figure 12 suggests that disagreements between the AI’s choice of\nmore positive explanation and the associated FT score difference occur closer to zero – i.e., where\nthe feeling thermometer scores are more similar.\nWe further confirm this result by applying the Bradley-Terry model described in Wu et al. [2023]\nto calculate the latent dimension of warmth. In brief, this method assumes that the probability\nthat an actor i “wins” in a pairwise comparison against actor j is simply the ratio of i’s latent\n“ability” αi to that of j. Formally:\nP r(i > j) = αi\nαj\n(2)\nBy setting λi = exp(αi), estimation if these latent abilities is easily done via a logistic regression\nvia\nlog\n\"\nP r(i > j)\nP r(j > i)\n#\n= λi − λj (3)\nFollowing Wu et al. [2023], we estimate these “ability” scores (or in our setting “warmth” scores)\nusing the ‘BradleyTerry2 package forR, and set a score of 50 as the reference point. As illustrated in\nFigure 13, the latent measure of warmth generated by the Bradley-Terry model recovers the feeling\nthermometer scores reasonably well, with scores below 50 being associated with lower warmth\nscores, and those above 50 being associated with higher warmth scores.\n26\n#1 warmer #2 warmer\n#1 warmer 732 217\n#2 warmer 190 861\nTable 2: Confusion matrix summarizing results of pairwise comparison between two explanations,\none of which was associated with a warmer feeling thermometer score than the other.

These changes have altered a core conclusion\ndrawn in our initial analysis: namely that synthetic data exaggerated the evidence of affective\npolarization in the United States. These results do replicate in several versions of our subsequent\nsynthetic data collections (notably not in the first-person prompt, however), but are inconsistent\nacross persona covariates and target groups. As such, we have removed these results from the focus\nof our manuscript, and reproduce them here for the sake for posterity.\n6.1 Exaggerated Extremism\nThe main conclusion from our initial analysis was that the synthetic data exaggerated the evidence\nof out-group antipathy along the dimensions of partisanship and ideology by a factor of approx-\nimately 6.5. Substantively this means that the gap between feeling thermometer scores toward\nDemocrats and Republicans was approximately 6.5 times larger in the synthetic data based on the\nApril 2023 run of the simple prompt, compared to the same measure calculated in the ANES data.\nWe visualize this exaggerated extremism in Figures 14, 15, and 16 below.\nFigure 14 indicates that synthetic Democrats and Republicans feel warmer toward their co-\nideologues, and colder toward their out-ideologues, than real humans do. Similar exaggerations are\ndocumented in attitudes toward the political parties, although these only obtain for the in-group\nparties. Out-group evaluations measured in the synthetic data are similar to those measured among\nhuman respondents.\nFigure 15 documents similar patterns by calculating the difference between two societal groups\n(conservatives and liberals, Republican and Democrat parties, white and black Americans, and\nChristians and Muslims) in both the synthetic and human samples. We then plot these differences\nby race (rows) and party affiliation (y-axes), where zero indicates that there is no difference in\nfeeling thermometer scores between the two groups. Bars that lie further from zero indicate greater\npolarization estimated in that data. As illustrated, in almost every comparison, the polarization\nmeasured in the synthetic data is larger than that found in the human sample.\nA final test confirms that not only are these differences larger in the synthetic data than in\nthe human data, but that these differences are statistically significant in all but a small minority\nof examples. Figure 16 visualizes these results as the difference in the thermometer gap described\nabove, between the synthetic data and the ANES. Positive values (in black) indicate how much\nlarger the gap is in the synthetic data, while negative values (in red) indicate how much larger the\ngap is in the human data. As illustrated, across all race-by-partisan-by-gap profiles, the ANES data\nis more polarized in only 5 examples, and is only significantly different from the synthetic estimate\nin two of these. The rest all point toward the synthetic data exaggerating the thermometer gaps,\nand significantly so in all but two cases (Hispanic independent measures of the partisan gap, and\nBlack Republican measures of the racial gap).\n6.2 Replicating with different survey\nThe preceding conclusions rely on ANES data, one of the most well-known nationally representative\npublic opinion polls of U.S. politics. We also validated our initial results using a bespoke survey\nof 2,322 online respondents fielded in 2021 that investigated affective polarization in the context of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic (Clinton and Kam [2022]).

Figures 17, 18, and 19 recreate the figures summarized in the preceding\nsection using this alternative dataset, finding substantively similar evidence of exaggerated feeling\nthermometer gaps across the dimensions of the political parties and whites versus black Americans.\n6.3 Detailed description of summary statistics\nTo calculate the degree to which ChatGPT-generated responses are more extreme than found among\nhuman respondents in the ANES, we turn to our matched data where every human respondent in\nthe ANES is matched with a set of random pulls from the ChatGPT API, prompted to adopt the\npersona of the ANES respondent along the dimensions of age, gender, race, education, income,\nand partisanship. For each demographic profile defined by these characteristics, we calculate the\naverage feeling thermometer expressions toward the set of target groups asked in the ANES. We\nthen calculate the same average among the synthetic humans generated by ChatGPT which were\nmatched to the real ANES respondents. For each demographic profile, we thus obtain an average\nfeeling thermometer for a given target group estimated by ChatGPT and among the humans\n31\nIdeology\n(Cons − Lib)\nParty\n(Rep − Dem)\nRacial\n(White − Black)\nReligious\n(Christian − Muslim)\nHispanicnon−Hispanic blacknon−Hispanic white\n−50 0 50 −50 0 50 −50 0 50 −50 0 50\nDemocrat\nIndependent\nRepublican\nDemocrat\nIndependent\nRepublican\nDemocrat\nIndependent\nRepublican\nGap in Thermometer Scores\n(Positive = warmer toward Cons / Rep / White / Christian)\nRespondent Partisanship\nData ANES LLM\nGap in target group feeling thermometer in columns\nAffective Polarization\nFigure 15: X-axes measure the difference in feeling thermometer ratings between two target groups\n(columns), by the party ID of the respondent (y-axes) and their race (rows).

Horizontal lines indicate one standard deviation.\nsampled by the ANES. Since a thermometer score of 50 captures an indifferent or “neutral” attitude\ntoward a given outgroup, we measure extremism as the absolute difference between the recorded\nattitude and 50. Our summary statistic of ChatGPT’s extremism is thus the ratio of the LLM\nmodel’s average absolute difference divided by the ANES data’s average absolute difference. Ratios\ngreater than 1 indicate that ChatGPT’s estimates are more extreme (either more warm or more\ncool) than real human attitudes, while those less than 1 indicate the opposite. On average, across\nall covariate profiles and all target groups, synthetic responses gathered from ChatGPT are 4.88\ntimes more extreme than those recorded among real human respondents to the ANES. Broken out\nby target group, we see consistent evidence that ChatGPT’s estimates are always further from 50\non average than the averages found among real humans responding to the ANES.\nTurning to the question of antipathy toward outgroups (measured as either affective polariza-\ntion, partisan sectarianism, or racial or religious antipathy), we pursue a similar exercise. Specif-\nically, we calculate the measure of “polarization” along each dimension, subtracting sentiments\ntowards liberals, Democrats, Blacks, or Muslims from the sentiments towards conservatives, Re-\npublicans, Whites, and Christians, respectively. The resulting measures are positive when the\nrespondent is more warm toward stereotypically conservative / Republican groups, and negative\nwhen the respondent is more warm toward stereotypically liberal / Democratic groups. Given the\nmatched nature of the data, we are able to calculate these measures using both the real human’s\n32\nn=359\nn=594\nn=2165\nn=285\nn=178\nn=158\nn=36\nn=2584\nn=418\nn=675\nn=2366\nn=320\nn=2427\nn=184\nn=41\nn=2899\nn=353\nn=577\nn=2094\nn=280\nn=168\nn=151\nn=34\nn=2504\nn=1981\nn=260\nn=161\nn=1990\nn=135\nn=29\nn=2221\nn=2181\nn=206\nn=2115\nn=323\nn=502Black Democrat: Religious\nWhite Independent: Ideology\nHispanic Democrat: Religious\nBlack Independent: Party\nWhite Independent: Racial\nWhite Independent: Party\nWhite Democrat: Religious\nBlack Republican: Racial\nHispanic Independent: Party\nBlack Independent: Racial\nHispanic Republican: Racial\nBlack Independent: Religious\nHispanic Democrat: Racial\nBlack Democrat: Racial\nWhite Republican: Racial\nHispanic Independent: Racial\nHispanic Republican: Party\nHispanic Independent: Ideology\nWhite Republican: Party\nWhite Democrat: Racial\nBlack Democrat: Party\nHispanic Independent: Religious\nHispanic Democrat: Party\nWhite Democrat: Party\nWhite Republican: Religious\nWhite Independent: Religious\nHispanic Republican: Religious\nHispanic Republican: Ideology\nWhite Republican: Ideology\nWhite Democrat: Ideology\nBlack Independent: Ideology\nHispanic Democrat: Ideology\nBlack Republican: Religious\nBlack Republican: Party\nBlack Democrat: Ideology\nBlack Republican: Ideology\n−10 0 10 20 30 40 50\nLLM minus ANES\nIdentity: Gap\nSig @95%\nANES\nLLM\nInsig\nLLM minus ANES\nMeasures of societal division\nFigure 16: Difference in estimated societal polarization along the dimensions of ideology, parti-\nsanship, race, and religion between thermometer gaps estimated from ChatGPT (LLM in black)\nand from human survey respondents (ANES in red), by race and partisanship of the respondents\n(y-axis).

We then calculate the ratio of the absolute value of the LLM’s measure of polarization\nrelative to that found in the ANES for each respondent (again relying on the absolute value). The\nresulting overall average ratio across all respondents and all groups is just under 7, suggesting that\nChatGPT estimates are biased toward out-group antipathy.\nHowever, ratios are sensitive to outliers, particularly in the denominator. If the ANES dif-\nference happens to be zero (a likely event given the pressures of social desireability bias in which\nrespondents want to be seen as egalitarian), whatever small difference found in the LLM results will\nbe exaggerated. We therefore plot the raw distributions of polarization across the four measures\nof partisanship, ideology, race, and religion (y-axis) in Figure 21. As illustrated, ChatGPT’s esti-\nmates are consistently more polarized than those found among human respondents to the ANES,\nalthough we note that there are many examples where an ANES respondent’s attitudes are more\npolarized than its synthetic counterparts.\n33\n***\n***\n*** ***\nDemocrat rating of...

Statistically significant differences indicated with ***\n= p < .001; ** = p < .01; * = p < .05.\nTo evaluate the degree to which ChatGPT estimates are less variable (i.e., more confident)\nthan estimates generated by real humans, we start by calculating the standard deviation for each\nrace-by-party-by-target group profile in the LLM and ANES data, then divide the latter by the\nformer. We plot the results of this exercise in Figure 22, averaging over race and party ID to\ncalculate a summary measure of how much more confident ChatGPT is in its estimates than the\nANES. As above, the vertical dashed line at 1 indicates parity. As illustrated, ChatGPT’s standard\ndeviations are consistently between one-quarter and one-third the size of those found among human\nrespondents to the ANES, with an overall average of roughly 0.314.\nAn alternative way of characterizing ChatGPT’s exaggerated precision is by looking across all\ndemographic profiles with two or more respondents in the ANES data, and dividing the ChatGPT\nstandard deviation by that in the ANES. We plot each profile’s ratio in Figure 23, sizing the\npoints by the number of observations in each profile, and labeling each outcome by the proportion\nof profiles whose ChatGPT-derived estimate is more precise than the ANES-derived estimate.\nOverall, 95% of profiles with two or more ANES respondents that expressed a feeling thermometer\ntoward an outgroup had smaller standard deviations when estimated using ChatGPT relative to\nhuman respondents to the ANES. And as Figure 23 makes clear, this conclusion is far stronger if\nwe focus on demographic profiles with more ANES respondents.\n34\nParty\n(Rep − Dem)\nRacial\n(White − Black)\nHispanicnon−Hispanic blacknon−Hispanic white\n−50 0 50 −50 0 50\nDemocrat\nIndependent\nRepublican\nDemocrat\nIndependent\nRepublican\nDemocrat\nIndependent\nRepublican\nGap in Thermometer Scores\n(Positive = warmer toward Cons / Rep / White / Christian)\nRespondent Partisanship\nData CLIKAM LLM\nLLMs exaggerate group−level antipathy\nAffective Polarization\nFigure 18: X-axes measure the difference in feeling thermometer ratings between two target groups\n(columns), by the party ID of the respondent (y-axes) and their race (rows).

Subsequent runs of the same prompt, as well as the first-person modification,\nand the more detailed version of the prompt, yield less convincing evidence of this particular\ndimension along which the synthetic data fails to recover real human patterns. Empirically, this\nattenuation in our findings is likely due to the evidence of mean reversion over time, as documented\nin our manuscript. However, as we document in Figure 24, the core conclusion that synthetic data\nexaggerates our differences persists across all new samples with the exception of that generated\nby the first-person pronouns prompt. Consistent with the work by Levendusky and Malhotra\n[2016], this result suggests that asking an LLM to pretend to be someone else produces exaggerated\nmeasures of out-group antipathy, just like with humans. Nevertheless, we demonstrate in SI Section\n3 that this is not a silver bullet against the myriad other issues we document with the synthetic\ndata.\n35\nn=185\nn=186\nn=505\nn=108\nn=79\nn=457\nn=62\nn=14\nn=736\nn=185\nn=186\nn=505\nn=108\nn=79\nn=62\nn=14\nn=736\nn=457White Independent: Racial\nWhite Independent: Party\nHispanic Republican: Racial\nBlack Republican: Racial\nHispanic Republican: Party\nWhite Democrat: Party\nHispanic Independent: Party\nHispanic Democrat: Racial\nWhite Republican: Racial\nHispanic Independent: Racial\nBlack Democrat: Racial\nBlack Independent: Racial\nWhite Republican: Party\nHispanic Democrat: Party\nWhite Democrat: Racial\nBlack Democrat: Party\nBlack Independent: Party\nBlack Republican: Party\n0 10 20 30\nLLM minus CLIKAM\nIdentity: Gap\nSig @95%\nCLIKAM\nANES\nInsig\nLLM minus CLIKAM\nMeasures of societal division\nFigure 19: Difference in estimated societal polarization along the dimensions of ideology, partisan-\nship, race, and religion between thermometer gaps estimated from ChatGPT (LLM in black) and\nfrom human survey respondents (bespoke survey in red), by race and partisanship of the respon-\ndents (y-axis).

Our subsequent analyses then aggregated over\ndifferent depths of a subset of these dimensions to characterize the bias among racial and partisan\ngroups. Here, we instead ask ChatGPT to adopt the persona of the average American and provide\nthe same estimates. Specifically, we instruct ChatGPT to adopt the following generalized identities:\n• Basic: person, registered voter\n• Party: Democrat, Republican, Independent voter\n• Age: 20, 35, 50, 65 year old\n• Race: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic\n• Gender: male, female\n• Income: person making $30,000, $50,000, $80,000, $100,000, $150,000 per year\n• Ideology: liberal, moderate, conservative\nEach of these identities is not overlaid with other dimensions, meaning we only ask ChatGPT\nto pretend to be a person living in the USA, a 20 year old living in the USA, a Republican living\nin the USA, etc. We then characterize how similar these generic identities are to 1) ANES profiles\nand 2) the richer ChatGPT profiles used in the main analysis. In conducting this analysis, we no\nlonger apply an exact match, and instead simply compare averages between these different sources.\nOur first set of results, visualized in Figure 25, compare how similar the ChatGPT generic iden-\ntities are to each other. Specifically, we calculate the average attitudes toward different outgroups\nwith the “person living in the USA” prompt to the same generated by the “Democrat / Republi-\ncan living in the USA” prompt, and then subtract the absolute value of the Democrat difference\nfrom the absolute value of the Republican difference. As illustrated, the generic American is more\nsimilar to the generic Democrat than to the generic Republican across almost all outcomes, and\nsignificantly more for groups more associated with Democrats.\nTo calculate the difference between generic synthetic respondents and real ANES humans, we\ncompare the average feeling thermometer for each synthetic persona to the average feeling ther-\nmometer among actual Democrats and Republicans in the ANES. We then plot the difference in\nthese differences in Figure 26, where negative values (meaning that the difference between the\nLLM and the ANES Democrats is smaller than the difference between the LLM and the ANES\nRepublicans) are indicated in blue, and positive values are indicated in red. Substantively, the\nplot highlights that, across most personae and across most target groups, ChatGPT’s attitudes are\nmore similar to Democrats than to Republicans. Importantly, the only personae where this pattern\ndoesn’t hold on average are when we prompt it to adopt the identity of a conservative Ameri-\ncan, a Republican American, or a non-Hispanic white American. Perhaps even more importantly,\nChatGPT’s attitudes toward all target groups are more similar to actual Democrats’ attitudes than\nRepublicans, with the exception of attitudes toward Jews, the Republican Party, and Muslims. The\nlatter, in particular, has more Republican-leaning attitudes among synthetic ChatGPT persona for\nevery identity excepting women, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, liberals, and Democrats.\n42\nLiberals\nGays and Lesbians\nDemocratic Party\nDemocrats\nImmigrants\nBlack Americans\nRepublicans\nConservatives\nChristians\nWhite Americans\nRepublican Party\nHispanic Americans\nWomen\nJews\nAsian Americans\nMuslims\n30 20 10 0 10 20 30\n\"person living in the USA\"\n<− More similar to Democrats ...

We chose this year for two reasons. First, it is\ntemporally proximate to when the training data ends for ChatGPT 3.5 (September 2021). Second,\nit is prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, which we suspect would influence politically relevant beliefs\n– potentially including feeling thermometers. Combined, our goal was to find the easiest possible\ntest case for the LLM.\nHowever, our ANES data is not from 2019, but instead is two waves fielded in 2016 and 2020.\nBelow, we test the sensitivity of our conclusions to the detailed prompt that explicitly links the\nhuman and synthetic respondents by year. We first examine whether the LLM performs worse\nwhen asked to provide responses from subjects in 2016 versus 2020. If ChatGPT’s performance is\ntemporally bound, it raises serious concerns about the use of synthetic samples generated by the\nLLM. Figure 27 visualizes the results of a simple analysis wherein we calculate the per-respondent\nmean absolute error and then average across groups and years. Black borders indicate a statistically\nsignificant difference, and dark bars represent the 2020 vintage. As illustrated, there is little\nevidence of significant performance loss in 2016 versus 2020. If anything, the LLM is worse at\npredicting attitudes towards Christians in 2020, and better at predicting attitudes towards Gays\nand Lesbians in 2020. Across all other groups, the differences are both statistically and substantively\nnegligible.\nWe then test whether the empirical over-time change in group feeling thermometers found\namong the human subjects is replicated in the synthetic data. To test, we run a regression on the\nstacked dataset where we predict the feeling thermometer for each respondent as a function of the\nyear interacted with data source and the party ID, implementing fixed effects for the target group.\nThe predicted values of this regression are presented in Figure 28, illustrating little evidence of\ndifferences in the overtime change. However, when we run the same specification but include the\ninteraction with the target group, we find divergent over time changes in attitudes towards white\nAmericans in particular (see Figure 29. In general, the LLM data appears to consistently report\nthe same or warmer attitudes among all partisans for all target groups in 2020 relative to 2016,\nwhile these patterns vary among the humans surveyed in the ANES.\n45\nAsian Americans\nConservatives\nBlack Americans\nLiberals\nJews\nWhite Americans\nDemocratic Party\nChristians\nRepublican Party\nMuslims\nGays and Lesbians\n0 5 10 15 20\nMean Absolute Error (MAE)\nGroup\nSig @ 95%\nInsig\nSig\nY ear\n2016\n2020\nMean absolute error (MAE) by group and year\nLLM performance by year\nFigure 27: Mean absolute error (MAE, x-axis) measuring the absolute difference between the ANES\nfeeling thermometer score for a given group (y-axis) averaged across all human respondents in 2016\n(light gray bars) and 2020 (dark gray bars).

Higher\ntemperatures mean that ChatGPT doesn’t always choose the highest probability next word, but\ncan instead choose the second highest, or third highest, and so on. In principle, this means that\nthe results produced by our prompts are characterized by their own probability distribution. While\nour main findings concluded that the LLM’s estimates were overly precise relative to real humans,\nit remains unclear what the actual nature of this posterior probability distribution is.\n9.1 GPT’s Self-Reported “Confidence”\nUnfortunately, ChatGPT does not allow users to directly observe the posterior probabilities for each\noutput.4 However, we tried asking the AI to provide its confidence in the feeling thermometer score\nit provided. Our prompt yielded almost 900,000 responses that were non-numeric in nature, the\nvast majority of which adhered to a 5-item scale ranging from not at all confident to very confident,\nalthough the precise wording varied. In addition, we note that there were very few examples of\nresponses that indicated lower levels of confidence (i.e., “somewhat”, “moderately”, “medium”).\nWe plot the distribution of these truncated responses for reference in Figure 30, but drop them\nfrom our main analyses that follow which focus only on responses that included a number between\n0 and 100 percent.\nTurning to the numeric responses provided by the AI, we again see that they are mainly confi-\ndent, with the majority of values above 80 (see Figure 31).\nWe can plot these measures of the AI’s subjective confidence against two dimensions of variation\nwhere we might expect to find less confidence. The first is in the richness of the prompt description.\nAs illustrated in Figure 32, we show that the average self-reported confidence for responses provided\nin the demographics-only prompt are lower than those provided in the politics-only or combined\nprompts, with the latter recording the highest overall average. Substantively, this seems sensible:\nwhen the AI is given a vaguer sketch of the persona they are meant to adopt, its confidence\nin the responses declines. Interestingly, this is most pronounced for the feeling thermometers\nabout politically salient groups (Democratic Party, Republican Party, liberals, and conservatives).\nWithout knowledge of the persona’s political identity, the LLM is less confident in its guess at the\npersona’s feeling thermometer toward political groups.\nThe second dimension is the feeling thermometer itself. All else equal, we might expect that a\nneutral feeling thermometer is associated with weaker confidence, whereas either very cold or very\nwarm feelings are associated with greater confidence. This expectation is again supported in the\ndata, as visualized in Figure 33. Where we have sufficient coverage across the support of feeling\nthermometer scores (x-axes) we see a U-shaped pattern in the LLM’s confidence.\nThe preceding analyses rely on the LLM’s self-reported confidence to understand the variability\nof the synthetic data it generates. However, as we show in Figure 34, the relationship between self-\nreported confidence (x-axes) and empirical uncertainty (standard deviation of feeling thermometer\nscores associated with a certain group and confidence, y-axes) is – if anything – positive. This\nmeans that the more confident is ChatGPT in its feeling thermometer score for a given group, the\nmore variation we observe in the scores. Note that this plot is generated by calculating the average\nconfidence for all thirty synthetic draws for each human respondent for each target group, along with\nthe standard deviation of the generated feeling thermometer scores, meaning that these patterns\n4Other tools such as Da Vinci, OpenAI’s LLM-based classifier, do provide such information.\n49\nstrong confidence\nlow confidence\nhave confidence\nis confident\nmedium confidence\nreasonably confident\nnot confident\nrelatively confident\nmoderate confidence\nfeel confident\nhigh confidence\nextremely confident\npretty confident\nquite confident\nmoderately confident\nhighly confident\nsomewhat confident\nfairly confident\nvery confident\nconfident\n0e+00 1e+05 2e+05 3e+05\nNumber of responses\nTop 20 most commonly occurring responses\nDistribution of text expressions of confidence\nFigure 30: Descriptive prevalence of non-numeric confidence responses, truncated to only include\nthe word stem “confid” and the word prior.\nare not driven by heterogeneity across partisanship or some other attribute. While some of the\ntarget groups exhibit less of a strong positive association than others, we nevertheless underscore\nthat none of the evidence suggests that self-reported confidence is a reasonable proxy for empirical\nuncertainty.\n50\n0\n500000\n1000000\n1500000\n2000000\n0 25 50 75 100\nConfidence\nNumber of responses\nNumeric responses converted to 0 to 100%\nDistribution of numeric expressions of confidence\nFigure 31: Empirical distribution of numeric confidence responses.\n51\nMuslims Republican Party White Americans\nDemocratic Party Gays and Lesbians Jews Liberals\nAsian Americans Black Americans Christians Conservatives\n70 80 90 70 80 90 70 80 90\n70 80 90\ndemogs\nfull\npol\ndemogs\nfull\npol\ndemogs\nfull\npol\nConfidence\nPrompt\nAverage confidence +/− 1SD\nRelationship between confidence and prompt\nFigure 32: Average confidence (points) plus / minus one standard deviation (bars) indicated on\nthe x-axes, as a function of the prompt (y-axes) and target group (facets).\n52\nMuslims Republican Party White Americans\nDemocratic Party Gays and Lesbians Jews Liberals\nAsian Americans Black Americans Christians Conservatives\n0 25 50 75 100 0 25 50 75 100 0 25 50 75 100\n0 25 50 75 100\n0\n30\n60\n90\n0\n30\n60\n90\n0\n30\n60\n90\nLLM FT Score\nConfidence\nPotential errors\nFT != Conf\nFT == Conf\n# obs\n25000\n50000\n75000\n100000\nConfidence versus FT score\nFigure 33: Feeling thermometer score produced by ChatGPT (x-axes) against numeric confidence\nassociated with the score (y-axes) by target group (facets).

X-axes indicate the average numeric confi-\ndence associated with these 30 samples.\n54\n9.2 Empirical Uncertainty\nHow then can we understand the uncertainty of the AI? As discussed in the main text, ChatGPT\nproduces far less variation in its synthetic data, relative to real humans. Would this change if\nwe provided a more detailed description of each human respondent? In theory, if the algorithm\nwas given a rich characterization for each person, it might do a better job predicting their actual\nattitudes towards different groups, and thus better reproduce the empirical variability of these\nresponses when aggregated for statistical analysis. Yet as illustrated in Figure 35, the per-human\nvariation doesn’t actually decline with richer descriptions. As above, we generate this plot by calcu-\nlating ChatGPT’s standard deviation for the synthetic approximations of each human respondent’s\nfeelings by group and by prompt. While the LLM’s variability is largest in the demographics-only\ncondition, it is smallest not in the combined prompt, but rather in the politics-only prompt.\nCombined\nPolitics only\nDemographics only\n0 10 20 30\nFT score standard deviation\nPrompt\nFT scores by prompt\nFigure 35: Distribution of standard deviations (x-axis) calculated across 30 synthetic samples for\neach human respondent-by-target group-by-prompt type (y-axis).\nOne possible explanation might be that less frequently occurring groups are more difficult for\nthe algorithm to predict since they constitute a smaller part of the training data. With 30 samples\nper human-by-prompt-by-target group, we start with a measure of the standard deviation at this\nunit of analysis and plot the average standard deviation by the number of humans who make up\neach profile. As illustrated in Figure 36, there is little evidence that ChatGPT is more confident\nfor groups that are more commonly occurring in the data, contrary to expectations.\nIt may be that ChatGPT struggles more with contradictory descriptions, such as a liberal\nRepublican or a conservative Democrat. We do find some evidence for this expectation in Figure 37,\nwhich shows marginally larger standard deviations for more extreme ideological groups, especially\nwhere the ideology is misaligned with the party. The average synthetic standard deviation for the\nmost commonly-appearing groups is slightly less than 7 feeling thermometer degrees, while the\nsame measure for the least commonly-appearing groups is more than 10.\nYet even in these instances where we record larger measures of uncertainty for the AI, we\nnevertheless underscore that these are far more precise than what we observe among real humans.\n55\n0\n10\n20\n30\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\nNumber of humans in profile\nLLM Standard Deviation\nCombined demographic and political profiles\nFrequency of human profiles versus ChatGPT uncertainty\nFigure 36: Distributions of standard deviations (y-axis) calculated across 30 synthetic samples for\neach human respondent-by-target group in the most detailed prompt by the number of human\nrespondents associated with the persona’s profile described in the prompt (x-axis).\nFirst, we reproduce the Figure 37 below but include the standard deviation of the ANES measures\nfor contrast (Figure 38). The figure illustrates that the curvelinear pattern documented in the\nsynthetic data is actually an accurate reflection of the uncertainty among human respondents,\ndespite being far less noisy. Extreme ideologues appear to be more volatile in both instances.\nSecond, we evaluate whether these differences in uncertainty also are reflected in the overall\nperformance gap between the ANES target and the synthetic data. Figure 39 compares the mean\nabsolute error (MAE, top row) and the ratio of standard deviations (bottom row) across the same\nbins, confirming the conclusion that the synthetic data is further from the ANES among profiles\nthat are less commonly occurring, although interestingly the gap in the variation narrows here,\nlikely due to the inflated standard deviations found in the synthetic data (see Figure 37).\nOne final question might be whether these patterns reflect solely the sample sizes or if they\nare also picking up the paradox of an extremely liberal Republican or an extremely conservative\nDemocrat. Presumably among the few humans who fit these descriptions, variation in the ANES FT\nscores is driven by genuine variation in their feelings towards these groups. Does the variation in the\nsynthetic data also reflect this natural variation? Or is it instead a product of the LLM sometimes\nprioritizing the ideological description and in other cases prioritizing the partisan description? (And\nif it is the latter, is this substantively different from what we might imagine is going on in the minds\nof those humans who self-identify in these non-aligned cells?)\nImportantly, we find less evidence of these relationships when we disaggregate further, suggest-\ning that the challenge is less to do with sparsely populated profiles per se, and more to do with\n56\n57\n933\n576\n94\n527\n15\n228\n321\n241\n838\n378\n350\n49\n87\n1224\n17\n310\n415\n55\n338\n6\nDemocrat Independent Republican\n7.5 10.0 12.5 7.5 10.0 12.5 7.5 10.0 12.5\nExtremely Conservative\nConservative\nSlightly Conservative\nModerate\nSlightly Liberal\nLiberal\nExtremely Liberal\nLLM SD\nIdeology\n# of humans 300 600 900 1200\nPolitical misalignment and synthetic uncertainty\nFigure 37: Average of standard deviations (x-axes) calculated across 30 synthetic samples for each\nhuman respondent-by-target group in the most detailed prompt by ideology (y-axis) and party ID\n(columns) of the persona described in the prompt.

With 30\nsynthetic respondents per human, we aggregate over all covariates included in the full prompt and\nplot the empirical distributions by profile and target group. Figure 42 plots the distribution for\nsynthetic feelings toward the Democratic Party by all personas (of which there are 7,530 associated\nwith human respondents). Horizontal bars represent the interdecile range and vertical marks cap-\nture the median, while colors reflect the partisan affiliation of the persona. Empirical distributions\nare ordered first by the median, then by the upper bound of the interdecile range.\nAs illustrated, there is clear evidence of anchoring of the synthetic data to 5 unit increments,\nwith the interdecile range exhibiting consistent terminations at units of 5. In addition, the plot\nreveals the highly consistent estimates of variance across all prompted personas, with the interdecile\nranges spanning between 10 and 20 thermometer “degrees”, and rarely spanning more than 20.\n58\n25−44 married white male with a bachelor's degree or more making $30k25−44 single black female with some college, but no degree making $50k25−44 single white male with a

the synthetic data’s variability (notably for the political parties),\nthere is never a target group for which the synthetic data is as noisy as the ANES data.\nAnd while there is also consistent evidence that the synthetic data estimates the attitudes\nof liberals and Democrats with less uncertainty than it does for conservatives and Republicans,\nthese differences are no greater than 1.5 thermometer degrees. Notably, these differences pale in\ncomparison to the differences in precision between the LLM and ANES data (see Figure 47).\nFinally, Figure 48 plots the empirical distributions for every profile and target group, broken\nout by ideology and party affiliation.\n61\nll\nl\nl\nl\nlll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlll\nl\nll\nllll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlll\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nlll\nl\nl\nlll\nl\nlll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlll\nllll\nllllll\nl\nll\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nll\nl\nlll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlll\nllll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nllll\nl\nl\nl\nllll\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl l\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlll\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nlll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlll\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nlll\nl\nl\nlll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nlll\nl\nllllll\nlll\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nlll\nl\nll\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nllll\nll\nl\nll\nll\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nll\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nllll\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nllll\nl\nll\nll\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl ll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nlll\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nll\nl\nlll\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nlll\nl\nll\nl\nll\nl\nl\nliberal moderate conservative\nLeft−skewedRight−skewed\n0 25 50 75 100 0 25 50 75 100 0 25 50 75 100\nSynthetic FT Score\nPersona\nPersona Party ID\nl\nl\nl\nDemocrat\nIndependent\nRepublican\nTarget group: Democratic Party\nEmpirical distribution of synthetic data\nFigure 43: Median synthetic feeling thermometer score (vertical bars, x-axis) by all personas (or-\ndered by thermometer score toward the Democrat Party, y-axis), along with interdecile range (bars)\nby the partisanship of the prompt (colors).

Thus, for example, the top-left facet presents the regression coeffi-\ncients capturing the difference between Republicans and Democrats in their feeling thermometer\nviews towards different target groups in 2016 and 2020, highlighting that the synthetic data finds\nsignificantly larger differences between Republicans and Democrats toward the Republican party\nthan found in the ANES data in 2016, but that this gap narrows by 2020.\nOne point of comparison that jumps out from these plots is the degree to which the coefficients\nestimated on the synthetic data are so much more precise than those found in the ANES data.\nEven though less than half of these comparisons are statistically significantly different from each\nother, these plots highlight how the substantive conclusions drawn in the synthetic data are anti-\nconservative, relative to what we would conclude using the human data. For example, the difference\nbetween registered and unregistered respondents is only marginally significant for one of the 11\ntarget group FT scores in the ANES data in 2020, while the synthetic data suggests that this\npredictor is significantly associated with 9 out of 11 groups.

Thus, for example, the top-left facet presents the regression\ncoefficients capturing the difference between men and women in their feeling thermometer views\ntowards different target groups in 2016 and 2020, highlighting that the synthetic data concludes\nthat men are warmer toward conservatives in both years, while the ANES finds the opposite.\nconcluding in favor of rejecting the null much more frequently in the synthetic data.\nWe highlight the variation in the specific conditional associations from the multivariate speci-\nfication in Figure 52, where each square indicates whether the difference between the ANES and\nLLM-based estimated coefficients would alter the interpretation. Specifically, white squares indi-\ncate estimates that are not statistically different between datasets, while shaded squares are those\nfor which the data significantly affects the estimated coefficients. Among the insignificant results,\nthere are some which would nevertheless yield contradicting substantive interpretations, such as\nwhere a relationship is statistically significant in the LLM data but a null result in the ANES data\n69\n2016 2020\n0% 25% 50% 75% 100% 0% 25% 50% 75% 100%\ninterest\nmarst\nregis\nincome\neducation\nraceth\nage\nPID\nideo3\ngender\nProportion of multivariate estimates sig @ 95%\nCovariate\nData\nANES\nLLM\nFigure 51: Proportion of regression coefficient estimates calculated in the fully specified model that\nare statistically significant at the 95% threshold (x-axes) by data sources (ANES indicated with red\ntriangles, ChatGPT indicated with black circles), covariate (y-axis) and year (columns). Predictors\nwith more statistically significant estimates in the ANES data are separated with solid red bars,\nwhile those with more statistically significant estimates in the synthetic data are indicated with\ndashed black bars.\n(indicated with white squares with gray borders). Similarly, the lightest gray squares indicate re-\nsults that – while statistically significantly different based on the data source – would nevertheless\nproduce consistent conclusions, such as the association between ideology and attitudes towards\nconservatives as illustrated in Figure 49 above. Conversely, darker gray squares indicate estimates\nwhere the substantive conclusions would change, and black squares reflect significant differences\nthat cross the null. As illustrated, even though roughly half (43%) of these results do not differ\nsignificantly by data source, the substantive conclusions one might draw are heavily influenced by\nthe choice between real humans and synthetic data.\n70\n2016 2020\nCont/BinaryEducIdeoInterest in\nNews & Pol\nMarital\nStatus\nParty\nIDRace\nAsian AmericansBlack Americans\nChristians\nConservatives\nDemocratic PartyGays and Lesbians\nJews\nLiberalsMuslims\nRepublican PartyWhite AmericansAsian AmericansBlack Americans\nChristians\nConservatives\nDemocratic PartyGays and Lesbians\nJews\nLiberalsMuslims\nRepublican PartyWhite Americans\nAge (1SD)\nIncome (1SD)\nMale − Female\nUnregistered − Registered\nBa Or More − No College\nSome College − No College\nConservative − Liberal\nModerate − Liberal\nAlways − Never\nFrequently − Never\nRegularly − Never\nSometimes − Never\nDivorced − Married\nSeparated − Married\nSingle − Married\nWidowed − Married\nIndependent − Democrat\nRepublican − Democrat\nBlack − White\nHispanic − White\nTarget Group\nCovariate\nEffect of source on results\nInsig: Same Conclusion\nInsig: Diff Conclusion\nSig: Same Conclusion\nSig: Diff Conclusion\nSig: Cross the null\nFigure 52: Difference between regression analytic conclusions based on the ANES or synthetic data from the\nmultivariate regression specification.

Light gray tiles with black borders indicate\nthat the coefficients are statistically significantly different, but that the substantive conclusion would not change\ndepending on which dataset was used (i.e., one would conclude that the difference between blacks and whites in their\nfeelings toward black Americans is statistically significantly different in either the ANES data or the synthetic data,\nbut the magnitude of these estimates is statistically significantly different depending on which data is used). Gray\ntiles with black borders indicate that the coefficients are statistically significantly different, and that the substantive\nconclusions would change (i.e., one would conclude that the difference between blacks and whites in their feelings\ntoward conservatives is statistically significant were they to rely on synthetic data, but is not significantly different\nwere they to estimate the same model using the ANES data, and that the difference in conclusions is statistically\nsignificant). Finally, black tiles indicate that not only does the data matter, but one would draw opposite substantive\nconclusions depending on which data was used to estimate the regression (i.e., blacks are significantly warmer toward\ngays and lesbians than whites in one dataset, but significantly colder toward the same group than whites in the other\ndataset).\n71\n11 Detailed Analysis of GPT 4\nWe reproduce our main results using the GPT 4 data here, highlighting little difference between\nthe 3.5 and 4.0 versions of the results. Due to budget constraints, we only generated synthetic\nresponses for the four purely political target groups, and only generated one synthetic response\nper human in the data, in contrast with the 30 synthetic samples per human respondent using\nChatGPT 3.5-turbo in our main results. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figures 53 through 56\nbelow, our core conclusions apply just as strongly to the synthetic data generated by ChatGPT 4.0\nas they did to the data generated by ChatGPT 3.5-turbo.\nRepublican Party\nDemocratic Party\nLiberals\nConservatives\n0 25 50 75 100\nFeeling Thermometer Score\nTarget Group\nData\nANES\nChatGPT 3.5\nLLM and ANES thermometer comparison\nFigure 53: Average feeling thermometer results (x-axis) for different target groups (y-axis) by\nprompt type / timing (columns).

Hexagons are shaded to indicate where\nthe samples lie.\n76\n12 Other outcomes\nOur main results document issues with synthetic data by comparing feeling thermometer responses\namong human respondents to the ANES to those generated by ChatGPT. However, this feeling\nthermometer measure might be uniquely difficult for an LLM to work with beyond its theorized\nbias towards extremism. As discussed in Section 5, raw numbers such as the 0 to 100 range used\nin feeling thermometer questions likely exist in a common part of the embedding space, making\nit harder for the LLM to distinguish nuanced differences. Here, we turn to a different type of\noutcome also commonly found in survey questions: the Likert scale. These scales are coarser but\nagain capture extremes of an attitude, with a moderate option in the center. Furthermore, each\npossible unit in this scale is explicitly defined, which may augment the LLM’s performance.\nSpecifically, we use a battery of questions about the appropriate role of government in the\neconomy, and whether protestors and revolutionaries should be allowed to spread their ideas. The\nhuman data is obtained from the International Social Survey Programme’s (ISSP) 2016 wave in\nwhich these questions were most recently asked. Our prompt is similar to the others described for\nthe ANES, albeit that we only include a subset of covariates in the description, and only collect 30\nobservations per profile. To assign a synthetic respondent to each human, we bootstrap sample from\nthis distribution with replacement for every human respondent over 30 associated with a profile,\ninstead of 30 per respondent (as in our “detailed” prompt described above in SI Section 1). In so\ndoing, we make the assumption that our sample of 30 synthetic respondents sufficiently describes\nChatGPT’s underlying posterior distribution, an assumption we feel is validated in Section 9.\nTo evaluate performance, we start with a single question about government spending among\nU.S. based respondents, and plot both the marginal distributions of responses among humans and\nChatGPT, as well their joint distribution in Figure 58. Tiles represent the proportion of ISSP\nhuman respondents (x-axis) whose synthetic counterparts gave each answer (y-axis), meaning that\nthese sum to one down the columns. Ideally, we would see the majority of the data winding up\non the diagonal, meaning that, for example, 90% of humans who are strongly in favor of cuts\nto government spending would be paired with a synthetic respondent who gave the same answer.\nInstead, ChatGPT’s synthetic respondents are bimodally distributed between being in favor of cuts\nand against cuts, with no discernible correlation to what their human counterparts think.\nWe also transform the data into a binary version by combining the Neither, In favour, and\nStrongly in favour responses into a positive category and the Against and Strongly against responses\ninto a negative category. Figure 59 plots these results for all six survey questions, highlighting that\neven where the LLM performs “well” it is still doing so only as a result of a preponderance of\nhumans answering the same way as the AI. We would hope to show that the black diagonals have\nthe highest percentages in both rows. Yet even though the LLM correctly indicates support for\ngovernment financing projects to create new jobs for 92% of the humans who also indicated support\n(gov finproj), it correctly classifies only 5% of those who are against this type of government\npolicy. Indeed, in no facet is the LLM correctly predicting the majority of human responses in both\nthe “Favor” and “Against” categories. Put another way, while ChatGPT’s precision is good, its\nrecall is bad.\nThe F1 score captures both the precision and recall of our confusion matrix for each category,\nwhich we transform into a summary statistic by weighting each category’s F1 score by its share in\nthe true (i.e., human generated) data. Figure 60 visualizes these results across the six questions\nabout government’s role in the economy, calculated both for the raw 5-item Likert measure as well\nas the binarized version described above. As illustrated, the synthetic data achieves an F1 score\nabove 0.8 only for the question about financing government projects and only when binarized to a\nfavor/against dichotomy.\n77\n15%\n29%\n15%\n39%\n2%\n15%\n31%\n14%\n37%\n2%\n10%\n31%\n13%\n40%\n5%\n19%\n32%\n15%\n32%\n2%\n42%\n8%\n8%\n42%\nStrongly\nin favour\nIn favour\nNeither\nAgainst\nStrongly\nagainst\nStrongly\nin favour\nIn favour Neither Against Strongly\nagainst\nISSP answers (humans)\nChatGPT answers (synthetic)\nLLM Errors % %Mismatched Matched\nCuts in Government Spending\nFigure 58: Comparison of real human answers to whether they are in favor of cuts to government\nspending (x-axis) with synthetic responses generated by ChatGPT to the same question, adopting\nthe same persona of the human respondents (y-axis).

This is in part due to evidence\nsuggesting that ChatGPT is biased toward western, English-speaking, and overall American content\nthanks to the preponderance of this content in its training data [Bender et al., 2021]. In theory\nthen, we might expect the AI to perform worse at generating synthetic data for non-American\nsubjects, especially for non-English speakers. To evaluate this question, we generated synthetic\nrespondents for all 35 countries included in the ISSP data. We then re-created the binary version\nof the confusion matrices for all 10 outcome questions described above, and ran a simple regression\nof the F1 score predicted by the country and the question. Figure 62 plots the predicted F1 scores\nfor each country (y-axes) and survey question, revealing little variation across countries but more\nsubstantive differences in performance by the questions themselves.\nspend\nfinproj\nlessreg\nsuppnew\nsuppdec\nwrkwk\nmeet\ndemo\nrevmeet\nrevbook\nGovt Role Protestors\n0.4 0.6 0.8 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\nSlovakiaSwitzerlandThailandCroatiaChileVenezuelaJapanUnited StatesTaiwanSouth AfricaGreat BritainSwedenNew ZealandRussiaLatviaSurinameFranceSouth KoreaLithuaniaSloveniaTurkeyIndiaCzech RepublicHungaryBelgiumGeorgiaIcelandAustraliaGermanySpainIsraelPhilippinesNorwayFinland\nF1 Score\nCountry\nBinary confusion matrix\nF1 Scores by County\nFigure 62: F-1 scores (x-axes) for six questions about the government’s role in the economy (left\nfacet) or four questions about what to allow protesters and revolutionaries to do (right facet), all\nof which are binarized such that the “favor” category corresponds to raw responses of “Neither”,\n“In favour”, or “Strongly in favour“ (left facet) and the “Allowed” category corresponds to raw\nresponses of “Definitely allowed”, or “Probably allowed“ (right facet).

These turn out to be questions where the human labels are highly skewed, inflating the\nF1 scores by providing an easier task of simply guessing the same attitude for everyone.\n83\n14 Replication with Open Source LLM\nWe replicated our main analysis of synthetic feeling thermometers toward the major political parties\nusing Falcon-40B-Instruct, an open source large language model.5 When we began this replication in\nsummer 2023, Falcon-40B-Instruct was the highest-performing open LLM according to the average\nof four performance metrics on HuggingFace’s public leaderboard. 6 We deployed the model for\ninference on HuggingFace’s Inference Endpoints service, using a “large” instance with four Nvidia\nTesla T4 GPUs. Total computation time, including initial prototyping and debugging, was 59\nhours, costing USD 265.50.\nInitial tests showed that Falcon, in contrast with ChatGPT, was not able to consistently provide\nresults for multiple groups at once in a regularly-formatted table. We modified our prompt to elicit\nfeeling thermometers for only one party at a time:\nIt is [YEAR]. You are a [AGE]-year-old, [MARITAL STATUS], [RACE] [GENDER]\nwith [EDUCATION] making [INCOME] per year, living in the United States. You are\n[IDEOLOGY], [REGISTRATION] [PARTY ID] who [INTEREST] pays attention to\nwhat’s going on in government and politics.\nThe following question asks about your feelings toward a group. Responses should be\ngiven on a scale from 0 (meaning cold feelings) to 100 (meaning warm feelings). Ratings\nbetween 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm toward the\ngroup. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don’t feel favorable\ntoward the group and that you don’t care too much for that group.\nYour feeling about [PARTY] on this 0-100 scale:\nWe sample from responses using a temperature of 1.0, and we limit responses to eight tokens.\nEven with the simpler prompt, Falcon does not consistently yield a valid feeling thermometer\nscore.

(Analogue of Figure 1 in the main text.)\nWe analyze the synthetic responses in the same manner as with the ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo re-\nsponses in the main text. Figure 63 reports the mean and standard deviation of feeling thermometer\nscores for each party in the synthetic data, taken across the full data. Like ChatGPT, Falcon yields\noverall averages close to what we see in our ANES comparison set: the synthetic mean for each\nparty is just 0.15–0.20 (ANES) standard deviations away from the corresponding average in the\n8Out of 7,530 synthetic respondents, we yield no valid Democratic score for 51 cases and no valid Republican\nscore for 41.\n85\nANES survey. The main difference between LLMs in this respect is that the Falcon averages are\nslightly below the corresponding ANES values, whereas the ChatGPT synthetic respondents are\nslightly warmer toward the parties than the ANES averages.\nIt is also evident from Figure 63 that the thermometer scores toward the parties are less vari-\nable across Falcon synthetic respondents than among ANES respondents. 9 For both parties, the\nstandard deviation of Falcon responses is just under 60% that of the ANES benchmark. While this\nfigure tracks with the overall variability of ChatGPT relative to ANES reported in the main text,\nwe see that Falcon is much further off the benchmark for the political parties specifically.\nDemocrat Independent Republican\nHispanicnon−Hisp. blacknon−Hisp. white\n0 25 50 75 100 0 25 50 75 100 0 25 50 75 100\nRepublican Party\nDemocratic Party\nRepublican Party\nDemocratic Party\nRepublican Party\nDemocratic Party\nFeeling Thermometer Score\nTarget Group\nData ANES Falcon−40B−Instruct\nLLM (Falcon) and ANES thermometer comparison\nFigure 64: Average feeling thermometer results (x-axis) for different target groups (y-axis) as a\nfunction of party identification and racial identity, replicated using the open source Falcon-40B-\nInstruct model. (Analogue of Figure 2 in the main text.)\nFigure 64 reports our subgroup analysis, showing the synthetic Falcon respondents’ feelings\ntoward the parties as a function of party identification and race. As in our main analysis of\nsynthetic data from ChatGPT, the synthetic responses are further from the ANES benchmark\nwhen we analyze at the subgroup level. Across the 18 comparisons reported in the figure, the\ndifference between the Falcon and ANES mean is 0.5 (ANES) standard deviations, ranging from\n0.05 to 1.4. We also see the same lower relative variation as in Figure 63, with Falcon responses\nwithin each subgroup having only about 60% the standard deviation of the corresponding ANES\nresponses.\nIn contrast with our main analysis of ChatGPT responses, we see less partisan polarization\nin the synthetic data produced by Falcon than we observe in the ANES benchmark. With the\nsole exception of Black Republicans’ feelings toward the Democratic Party, the typical synthetic\n9We use a temperature parameter of 1.0 in our Falcon inference (see full code below).\n86\nSample Size Needed\nPower ANES est.

(Analogue of Table 1 in\nthe main text.)\nrespondent produced by Falcon is cooler toward the in-party and warmer toward the out-party than\nthe corresponding average ANES respondent. Reliance on synthetic sampling from the Falcon LLM\nwould thus lead scholars to underestimate affective polarization, compared to the ANES values.\nIn combination with the relatively low variation in feeling thermometer scores across synthetic\nrespondents, this means the synthetic sample from Falcon would perform just as poorly as our main\nChatGPT sample in terms of pilot testing for a study on affective polarization. Table 3 reports the\nresults of our power analysis from the main text, applied to the Falcon sample. Once again, for a\nstudy to detect change in affective polarization since 2012, the synthetic data implies sample sizes\nabout an order of magnitude less than what we would derive from the ANES benchmark.\nFinally, Figure 65 reports the replication of our regression analyses using the synthetic responses\ngenerated by Falcon. (This figure is structured the same way as Figure 3 in the main text, though\nit is not directly comparable, as we only have thermometer scores for the two major parties in the\nFalcon data.) As in our main analysis, we find that the analysis on synthetic data often leads to\npartial correlations that are significantly different—and sometimes even signed differently—than if\nwe used the ANES benchmark. For 49% of the coefficients we estimate, there is a statistically sig-\nnificant difference between the estimate with the Falcon synthetic data and the ANES benchmark.\nAmong those that significantly differ as a function of data source, the sign of the estimate flips in\n36% of cases (represented by filled-in circles in the off-diagonal quadrants in Figure 65). We do find\nthat the coefficients on partisanship and ideology closely track their corresponding ANES values,\nthough with smaller estimated magnitudes (particularly for ideology). For the other covariates,\njust as in our main analysis with ChatGPT, we see much less correspondence.\nAltogether, synthetic sampling with Falcon-40B-Instruct—the best-in-class open source model\nat the time we began our research—suffers from the same issues as we observe with ChatGPT.\nWhile the LLM recovers overall average feelings toward the political parties surprisingly well, the\nsynthetic responses exhibit less variation than in the ANES benchmark, and the subgroup analyses\nand regression estimates are not particularly close to the baseline. Additionally, though the repro-\nducibility of the open source analysis is an undeniable benefit, there are also nontrivial challenges.\nWe had to rent GPU time from a cloud server just to deploy the model, as traditional desktop\n87\nRegistration News Interest\nRace Gender Marital Status Income\nPartisanship Ideology Education Age\n−2.5 0.0 2.5 −5 0 5\n−10 −5 0 5 10 −4 −2 0 2 4 −5.0 −2.5 0.0 2.5 5.0 −3 0 3\n−20 0 20 −40 −20 0 20 40 −3 0 3 −0.10−0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10\n−0.10\n−0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n−3\n0\n3\n−3\n0\n3\n−5.0\n−2.5\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\n−40\n−20\n0\n20\n40\n−4\n−2\n0\n2\n4\n−5\n0\n5\n−20\n0\n20\n−10\n−5\n0\n5\n10\n−2.5\n0.0\n2.5\nEstimates from ANES data\nEstimates from synthetic data (Falcon)\nSig.

The x-axis position is the coefficient estimated in the ANES data, and the y-axis\nposition is the same coefficient estimated in the Falcon synthetic data. (Analogue of Figure 3 in\nthe main text.)\n88\ncomputing hardware lacks the processing power and memory to work with 40 billion parameters.\nBecause of Falcon’s inferior language processing capability relative to ChatGPT, we could not\nreliably elicit scores about multiple groups from the “same” synthetic respondent at once. This\nresulted in a greater financial expense than the ChatGPT API calls for our main analysis, even\nthough we yielded thermometer scores for fewer groups.\n14.1 Full Inference Procedure\nWe use the following Python code to sample responses from Falcon-40B-Instruct on a HuggingFace\nInference Endpoint.\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom huggingface_hub import InferenceClient\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom textwrap import dedent\nfrom time import sleep\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\ndef make_prompt(series: pd.Series, target: str) -> str:\n\"\"\"Create prompt for a given respondent profile and group target.\"\"\"\nout = f\"\"\"\\\nIt is {series.year}.

You are {series.ideo}, {series.regis} {series.PID} who\n{series.interest} pays attention to what's going on in government and politics.\nThe following question asks about your feelings toward a group. Responses should be\ngiven on a scale from 0 (meaning cold feelings) to 100 (meaning warm feelings).\nRatings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm\ntoward the group. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel\nfavorable toward the group and that you don't care too much for that group.\nYour feeling about {target} on this 0-100 scale: \"\"\"\nreturn dedent(out)\n# Load the demographic values for ANES respondents\ndf_anes_simple = pd.read_csv('anes_simp.csv')\n# List of all target groups to elicit feeling thermometers for\nall_targets = ['the Democratic Party', 'the Republican Party']\n# Connect to huggingface endpoint:\n# Insert your endpoint url and private key below\nendpoint_url = \"HUGGINGFACE_ENDPOINT_URL\"\nwith open(\"YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE\", \"r\") as file:\n89\nhf_token = file.readlines()[0].rstrip()\nclient = InferenceClient(endpoint_url, token=hf_token)\n# Elicit responses for each respondent-target combination\nn_responses = 10\ndir_out = Path('results/falcon')\ndir_out.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\nfor index, series in tqdm(df_anes_simple.iterrows(), total=df_anes_simple.shape[0]):\n# Check that there isn't already output for this respondent\nfile_out = dir_out / f'{index}.json'\nif file_out.exists():\ncontinue\n# Try/except to work around occasional memory overflows on HuggingFace endpoint\ntry:\ndict_responses = {}\nfor target in all_targets:\nprompt = make_prompt(series=series, target=target)\nresponses = []\nfor _ in range(n_responses):\nr = client.text_generation(prompt,\nstream=False,\ndetails=False,\ntemperature=1.0,\nreturn_full_text=False,\ndo_sample=True,\nmax_new_tokens=8)\nresponses.append(r)\ndict_responses[target] = responses\n# Write output for this respondent to JSON file\ndict_out = dict(series)\ndict_out['index'] = index\ndict_out['responses'] = dict_responses\nfile_out.write_text(json.dumps(dict_out))\nexcept:\n# Overflow usually takes 1-2 minutes to resolve\nsleep(60)\nanes simp.csv is a CSV file containing demographic information for each synthetic respondent.\nA typical entry, formatted as a Pandas series, looks like:\nyear 2016\nraceth non-Hispanic white\nage 29\ngender male\nideo a conservative\nPID Republican\n90\nincome $80,000\nregis registered\neducation a high school diploma\ninterest frequently\nmarst married\nPython dependencies (requirements.txt) are as follows:\nannotated-types==0.5.0\ncertifi==2023.5.7\ncharset-normalizer==3.2.0\nfilelock==3.12.2\nfsspec==2023.6.0\nhuggingface-hub==0.16.4\nidna==3.4\nkaleido==0.2.1\nnodeenv==1.8.0\nnumpy==1.25.1\npackaging==23.1\npandas==2.0.3\npatsy==0.5.3\nplotly==5.15.0\npydantic==2.0.3\npydantic_core==2.3.0\npyright==1.1.317\npython-dateutil==2.8.2\npytz==2023.3\nPyYAML==6.0\nrequests==2.31.0\nscipy==1.11.1\nsix==1.16.0\nstatsmodels==0.14.0\ntenacity==8.2.2\ntqdm==4.65.0\ntyping_extensions==4.7.1\ntzdata==2023.3\nurllib3==2.0.3\n14.2 ANES in the Training Data\nA potential concern for comparing synthetic samples to published benchmarks is that large language\nmodels may be trained on those very benchmarks. Any correspondence between synthetic results\nand a baseline survey might therefore be due to the model essentially regurgitating information\nfrom its training set, meaning these models might perform considerably worse at synthetic sampling\ntasks where published benchmarks do not exist. Though the black-box nature of pretrained LLMs\nmeans we cannot pin down precisely why they yield particular responses, with an open source\nmodel we can at least examine whether its training set includes information about our comparison\nbenchmark.\n91\nThe Falcon-40B-Instruct LLM is trained on a refinement of the Common Crawl data [Penedo\net al., 2023]. From examining the public extract of the training data published on HuggingFace, 10\nit appears that the earliest data is from the summer 2013 crawl (CC-MAIN-2013-20) and the latest\nis from September/October 2022 (CC-MAIN-2022-40). 11 As a first cut to examine the possibility\nof our benchmark data appearing in the Falcon training data, we obtain the set of pages from\nelectionstudies.org that appear in the September/October 2022 Common Crawl corpus. We\nuse the cdx-index-client.py tool12 to query the Common Crawl Index API13 for pages matching\nthe electionstudies.org domain. Specifically, we use the command\n$ python cdx-index-client.py -c CC-MAIN-2022-40 \"electionstudies.org/*\" -v -j\nwhich runs the API call\nhttps://index.commoncrawl.org:443\n\"GET /CC-MAIN-2022-40-index?url=electionstudies.org%2F%2A&page=0&output=json HTTP/1.1\"\nThis returns a JSON file containing metadata about pages from the ANES’s website that appear\nin the Common Crawl data.\nOverall, the September/October 2022 Common Crawl contains 482 pages fromelectionstudies.org.\nThese consist of 355 HTML files, 115 PDFs, and 12 plain text files. The raw data files are behind\na login wall and thus do not appear to be included in the Common Crawl. 14 The only pages\napparently pertaining to the 2016 or 2020 time series studies we use as a benchmark are:\n• https://electionstudies.org/2016-time-series-updates-errata/\n• https://electionstudies.org/2020-time-series-study/2020-time-series-updates-errata/\n• https://electionstudies.org/2020-time-series-study/2020-time-series-updates-errata/\n%22\n• https://electionstudies.org/anes_timeseries_2020_methodology_report/\n• https://electionstudies.org/anes_timeseries_2020_nrfu_userguidecodebook_20211118/\n• https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2016-time-series-study/\n• https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-time-series-study/2020-time-series-updates-errata/\n• http://www.electionstudies.org/studypages/anes_timeseries_2016/anes_timeseries_\n2016_varlist.pdf\n• https://electionstudies.org/studypages/anes_timeseries_2016/anes_timeseries_2016_\nvarlist.pdf\n• https://electionstudies.org/updates-announcements/anes-announcement-2020-time-series-prelim-release-pre-and-post-election/\n10https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb.\n11See https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/.\n12https://github.com/ikreymer/cdx-index-client\n13https://index.commoncrawl.org/\n14As a first step to check if the raw data could have been obtained by other sources, we also queried for pages\nfrom the Harvard Dataverse. But the crawl contains only 70 pages total from Dataverse, none of which appear to be\ndata files.\n92\n• https://electionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/anes_timeseries_2020_nrfu_\nuserguidecodebook_20211118.pdf\n• https://electionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anes_timeseries_2020_methodology_\nreport.pdf\nNone of these files appears to contain raw data or even summary statistics about the feeling ther-\nmometer scores we use in our analyses. There are publicly available pages on the ANES web-\nsite containing such data (e.g., https://electionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/\nanes_timeseries_2016_userguidecodebook.pdf), but they do not appear at least in the most\nrecent crawl employed by Falcon-40B-Instruct. Altogether, while we can confirm that the model\nis trained on some official documentation about the 2016 and 2020 ANES studies, there is not\nimmediate evidence that our key outcomes of interest appear directly in the training data.\n93\nReferences\nE.
