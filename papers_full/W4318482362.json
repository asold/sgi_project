    "abstract": "This article presents a new model of a dedicated air transformer for computer analyses of wireless power transfer systems. This model includes a form of subcircuit for SPICE. It takes into account the electric, magnetic and thermal properties of the modeled device. The form of the elaborated model is presented and the results of its experimental verification are shown. Some results from measurements and computations of an air transformer and a wireless power transfer system containing this transformer are shown and discussed. The structure of the tested system and the measuring setup used are also described. The results of measurements and computations illustrating the influence of the distance between the windings of the air transformer and the displacement between its windings on the output voltage of the power transfer system are presented and discussed. The influence of load resistance on the properties of the considered system is analyzed.",
