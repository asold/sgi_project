Introduction\nVisual object tracking is a vital problem in many prac-\ntical applications, such as visual surveillance, public secu-\nrity, video analysis, and human-computer interaction. Ac-\ncording to the number of objects to track, the task of ob-\nject tracking is divided intoSingle Object Tracking (SOT)\nand Multiple Object Tracking (MOT). In recent years, the\nemerging of deep siamese networks [3, 37, 20, 19] have\nmade great progress in solving SOT tasks. However, the\nexisting MOT methods are still suffering from the model\ncomplexity and computational cost due to the multi-stage\npipeline [50, 36, 43] as shown in Figure 1a.\nA critical dilemma in many existing MOT solutions is\nwhen object detection and re-identiﬁcation are performed\nseparately, they can not beneﬁt each other. To tackle the\nproblem in MOT, a joint-detection-and-tracking framework\nis needed to share knowledge between detection and ob-\nject association. By reviewing SOT solutions, we empha-\nsize that Query-Key mechanism is promising in this direc-\n(a) Complex tracking-by-detection MOT pipeline.\n(b) Simple query-key SOT pipeline.\n(c) Query-key pipeline has great potential to setup a simple MOT\nmethod. However, it will miss new-coming objects.\nFigure 1: Motivation of TransTrack. The dominant MOT\nmethod is the complex multi-step tracking-by-detection\npipeline. Directly migrating the query-key mechanism from\nSOT to MOT will cause severe missing of new-coming ob-\njects. TransTrack is aimed to take advantage of query-key\nmechanism and to detect new-coming objects. The pipeline\nis shown in Figure 2.\n1\narXiv:2012.15460v2  [cs.CV]  4 May 2021\n𝜙\n𝐹!\nkey\n…\nobject query\n detection box\nmatching\ntracking box\ntrack query𝐹!\nobject feature\n(         track query )𝐹!\"#\nFigure 2: Pipeline of TransTrack. Both object feature query from the previous frame and learned object queries are taken\nas input. The image feature maps are a shared key. The learned object query detects objects in the current frame. The track\nquery from the previous frame associates objects of the current frame with the previous ones. This process is performed\nsequentially over all adjacent frames and ﬁnally completes the multiple object tracking tasks.\ntion. In existing works, the object target is the query and the\nimage regions are the keys as shown in Figure 1b. For the\nsame object, its feature in different frames is highly similar,\nwhich enables the query-key mechanism to output ordered\nobject sets. This inspiration should also be beneﬁcial to the\nMOT task.\nHowever, merely transferring the vanilla query-key\nmechanism from SOT into the MOT task leads to poor per-\nformance, signiﬁcantly causing much more false negatives.\nIt is because when an new object comes into birth, there is\nno corresponding features for it. This defect causes severe\nobject missing, as shown in Figure 1c. So what is a suitable\nquery-key mechanism for MOT remains a critical question.\nA desirable solution should be able to well capture new-\ncoming objects and propagate previously detected objects\nto the following frames at the same time.\nIn this paper, we make efforts in this direction by build-\ning an MOT framework based on transformer [38], which\nis an attention-based query-key mechanism. We term it as\nTransTrack. It leverages set prediction for detection [5]\nand the knowledge passed from the previous frame to gain\nreliable object association at the same time. There are two\nsets of keys (following previous works [5], they are confus-\ningly termed as “object query” in transformer). One set con-\ntains the object queries learned as in existing transformer-\nbased detector [5] and the other contains those generated\nfrom the features of objects on the previous frame, which\nare also termed as “track query” for clariﬁcation. The ﬁrst\nset of queries provides a sense of new-coming objects and\nthe track queries provide consistent object information to\nmaintain tracklets. Two sets of bounding boxes are pre-\ndicted respectively and TransTrack uses simple IoU match-\ning to generate the ﬁnal ordered object set from them.\nIn TransTrack, the two sets of boxes can be output from\na uniform decoder architecture with only different queries\nas input. Our model even removes the traditional NMS\nstage in detection. Therefore, our method is simple and\nstraightforward where all components of the model can be\ntrained at the same time. We evaluate TransTrack on the\ntwo real-world benchmarks MOT17 and MOT20 [26, 7]. It\nachieves 74.5 and 64.5 MOTA on the test set of MOT17 and\nMOT20 respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are\nthe ﬁrst to introduce the transformer in the MOT task. As\nit has achieved comparable performance with state-of-the-\nart models, we hope it could provide a new perspective and\nefﬁcient baseline for multi-object tracking tasks.\n2. Related Work\nIn this section, we ﬁrst review previous transformer ap-\nplications in vision tasks. Then we introduce the two main\nMOT paradigms, namely tracking-by-detection and joint-\ndetection-and-tracking methods.\nTransformer in vision tasks. Recently, there is a popu-\nlarity of using transformer architecture [38] in vision tasks,\nwhere it has been proven powerful and inspiring. As a spe-\ncial query-key mechanism, the transformer heavily relies on\nthe attention mechanism to process extracted deep features.\nIt ﬁrst shows great efﬁciency in natural language process-\ning [38] and later migrated to visual perception tasks [5]\nachieving remarkable success. Transformer appeals to the\nvision community with elegant structure and good perfor-\nmance. It has shown great potential in detection [5, 60], seg-\nmentation [57], 3D data processing [55] and even backbone\nconstruction [11]. Lately, the good efforts of using a trans-\nformer in processing sequential visual data also make re-\nmarkable shots in video segmentation [42]. With the natural\nstrength of passing features along the temporal dimension,\n2\nthe transformer shows the ability to contribute to diverse\ntemporal-spatial processing tasks on visual data and even\nreplaces the role of traditional RNN models [16]. How-\never, to the best of our knowledge, there are still no pub-\nlished transformer-based solutions for object tracking while\nit is intuitive to leverage its demonstrated good capacity in\nvisual perception and temporal processing there. Hence, in\nthis paper, we follow the insight to propose a transformer-\nbased model for MOT. It shows convincingly high perfor-\nmance on the popular MOT benchmark.\nTracking-by-detection. State-of-the-art multiple object\ntrackers are mostly dominated by the tracking-by-detection\nparadigm. It ﬁrstly uses the object detectors [23, 30, 22]\nto localize all objects of interest, then associates these de-\ntected objects according to their Re-ID features and/or other\ninformation, e.g., Intersection over Unions (IoU) between\neach other. SORT [4] tracks bounding boxes using the\nKalman Filter [44] and associates to the current frame by\nthe Hungarian algorithm [18]. DeepSORT [45] replaces\nthe association cost in SORT with the appearance fea-\ntures from deep convolutional networks. POI [50] achieves\nstate-of-the-art tracking performance based on the high-\nperformance detection and deep learning-based appearance\nfeature. Lifted-Multicut [36] combines the deep representa-\ntions and body pose feature obtained by the pose estimation\nmodel. STRN [48] presents a similarity learning frame-\nwork between tracks and objects, which encodes various\nSpatial-Temporal relations. Tracking-by-detection pipeline\nachieves leading performance, but its model complexity and\ncomputational cost are not satisfying.\nJoint-detection-and-tracking. The joint-detection-and-\ntracking pipeline aims to achieve detection and tracking\nsimultaneously in a single stage. D&T [13] proposes a\nmulti-task architecture for frame-based object detection and\nacross-frame track regression. Integrated-Detection [54]\nboosts the detection performance by combining the detec-\ntion bounding boxes in the current frame and tracks in pre-\nvious frames. More recently, Tracktor [1] directly uses\nthe previous frame tracking boxes as region proposals and\nthen applies the bounding box regression to provide track-\ning boxes on the current step, thus eliminating the box as-\nsociation procedure. JDE [43] and FairMOT [51] learn\nthe object detection task and appearance embedding task\nfrom a shared backbone. CenterTrack [58] localizes ob-\njects by tracking-conditioned detection and predicts their\noffsets to the previous frame. ChainedTracker [29] chains\npaired bounding boxes estimated from overlapping nodes,\nin which each node covers two adjacent frames. Our pro-\nposed TransTrack falls into the joint-detection-and-tracking\ncategory. Previous works adopt anchor-based [30] or point-\nbased [59] detection framework. Instead, we build the\npipeline based on a query-key mechanism and the tracked\nSelf-\nAttention\nCross-\nAttention\nFt  image     \nCNN\nAdd & Norm\nM x\nN \nx\nSelf-\nAttention\nFeed \nForward\nAdd & Norm\nAdd & Norm\nAdd & Norm\nAdd & Norm\nFeed \nForward\nobject query Ft  track query\nmatching\nFeed \nForward\nFeed \nForward\ndetection box tracking box\nFt object box\ntrack feature\nFt feature \nmap\nFt-1 feature \nmap\nSelf-\nAttention\nCross-\nAttention\nM x\nAdd & Norm\nAdd & Norm\nAdd & Norm\nFeed \nForward\nMatching\nDecoderDecoder\nEncoder\nobject feature\n(Ft+1 track query)\nBackbone\nFigure 3: The architecture details of TransTrack. First,\nthe current frame image is input to CNN backbone to ex-\ntract feature map. Then, both the current frame feature map\nand the previous one are fed into encoder to generate com-\nposite feature. Next, learned object query is decoded into\ndetection boxes and object feature of the previous frame is\ndecoded into tracking boxes. Finally, IoU matching is em-\nployed to associate detection boxes to tracking boxes.\nobject feature is used as the query.\n3. TransTrack\nIn MOT task, the desirable output is acomplete and cor-\nrectly ordered set of objects on each frame in a video. To\nthese two ends, TransTrack uses queries from two sources\nto gain adaptive cues. On the one hand, similar to usual\ntransformer-based detectors [5, 60], TransTrack takes an\nobject query as input to provide common object detec-\ntion results. On the other hand, TransTrack leverages\nfeatures from previously detected objects to form another\n“track query” to discover associated objects on the follow-\ning frames. Under this scheme, TransTrack generates in\nparallel two sets of bounding boxes, termed as “detection\n3\nboxes” and “tracking boxes”. Last, TransTrack uses the\nHungarian algorithm, where the cost is IoU area among\nboxes, to achieve the ﬁnal ordered box set from the two\nbounding box sets. The pipeline is illustrated in Figure 3.\n3.1. Pipeline\nIn this section, we introduce the encoder-decoder archi-\ntecture of TransTrack for object detection and object prop-\nagation. Given the detection boxes and tracking boxes from\ntwo decoders, box IoU matching is used to obtain the ﬁnal\ntracking result. We also introduce the training and inference\nprocess of TransTrack.\nArchitecture. TransTrack is based on transformer, an\nencoder-decoder framework. It replies on stacked multi-\nhead attention layers and feed-forward networks. Multi-\nhead attention is called self-attention if the input query and\nthe input key are the same, otherwise, cross-attention. In\ntransformer architecture, The encoder generates keys and\nthe decoder takes as input task-speciﬁc queries. The archi-\ntecture overview is shown in Figure 3.\nThe encoder of TransTrack takes the composed feature\nmaps of two consecutive frames as input. To avoid du-\nplicated computation, the extracted features of the current\nframe are temporarily saved and then re-used for the next\nframe. Two parallel decoders are employed in TransTrack.\nFeature maps generated from the encoder are used as com-\nmon keys by the two decoders. The two decoders are de-\nsigned to perform object detection and object propagation,\nrespectively. Speciﬁcally, a decoder takes learned object\nquery as input and predicts detection boxes. The other de-\ncoder takes the object feature from previous frames, namely\n“track query”, as input and predicts the locations of the cor-\nresponding objects on the current frame, whose bounding\nboxes are termed as tracking boxes.\nObject Detection. Following DETR [5], TransTrack lever-\nages learned object query for object detection. The object\nquery is a set of learnable parameters, trained together with\nall other parameters in the network. During detection, the\nkey is the global feature maps generated from the input im-\nage and the object query looks up objects of interest in the\nimage and outputs the ﬁnal detection predictions, termed as\n“detection boxes”. This stage is performed by the left-hand\ndecoder block in Figure 3.\nObject Propagation. Given detected objects in the previ-\nous frame, TransTrack propagates these objects by passing\ntheir features to the next frame as the track query. The stage\nis performed by the right-hand decoder block in Figure 3.\nThe decoder has the same architecture as the left-hand one\nbut takes queries from different sources. This inherited ob-\nject feature conveys the appearance and location informa-\ntion of previously seen objects, so this decoder could well\nlocate the position of the corresponding object on the cur-\nrent frame and output “tracking boxes”.\nBox Association. Provided the detection boxes and track-\ning boxes, TransTrack uses the box IoU matching method\nto get the ﬁnal tracking result, as shown in Figure 3. Apply-\ning the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm [18] to IoU similar-\nity of detection boxes and tracking boxes, detection boxes\nare matched to tracking boxes. Those unmatched detection\nboxes are kept to create new tracklets.\n3.2. Training\nTraining Data. We build training dataset from two sources.\nAs usual, the training data of could be two consecutive\nframes or two randomly selected frames from a real video\nclip. Furthermore, training data could also be the static\nimage [58], where the adjacent frame is simulated by ran-\ndomly scaling and translating the static image.\nTraining Loss. In TransTrack, tracking boxes and detec-\ntion boxes are the predictions of object boxes in the same\nimage. It allows us to simultaneously train two decoders by\nthe same training loss.\nTransTrack applies set prediction loss to supervise detec-\ntion boxes and tracking boxes of classiﬁcation and box coor-\ndinates. Set-based loss produces an optimal bipartite match-\ning between predictions and ground truth objects. Follow-\ning [5, 60, 35, 34, 39], the matching cost is deﬁned as\nL= λcls ·Lcls + λL1 ·LL1 + λgiou ·Lgiou (1)\nwhere Lcls is focal loss [23] of predicted classiﬁcations and\nground truth category labels,LL1 and Lgiou are L1 loss and\ngeneralized IoU loss [31] between normalized center coor-\ndinates and height and width of predicted boxes and ground\ntruth box, respectively. λcls, λL1 and λgiou are coefﬁcients\nof each component. The training loss is the same as the\nmatching cost except that only performed on matched pairs.\nThe ﬁnal loss is the sum of all pairs normalized by the num-\nber of objects inside the training batch.\n3.3. Inference\nIn the inference stage, TransTrack ﬁrst detects objects on\nthe ﬁrst frame, where the feature maps are from two copies\nof the ﬁrst frame. Then TransTrack operates object prop-\nagation and box association for the following frames and\nﬁnally completes tracklets over the entire video sequence.\nWe use track rebirth in the inference procedure of\nTransTrack to enhance robustness to occlusions and short-\nterm disappearing [1, 58, 29].

We compare TransTrack with recent methods in private protocol,\nwhere external data can be used: CH for CrowdHuman [33], 5D1 for the use of 5 extra datasets, including CrowdHuman [33],\nCaltech Pedestrian [9, 10], CityPersons [52], CUHK-SYS [47], and PRW [56], 5D2 is the same as 5D1 replacing CroudHu-\nman by ETH [12], NO for using no extra dataset.\n4. Experiments\nTo measure the performance of our proposed method,\nwe conduct experiments on the pedestrian-tracking dataset\nMOT17 [26] and MOT20 [7]. In the ablation study, we fol-\nlow previous practice [58] to split the MOT17 training set\ninto two parts, one for training and the other for validation.\nWe adopt the widely-used MOT metrics set [2] for quan-\ntitative evaluation where multiple object tracking accuracy\n(MOTA) is the primary metric to measure the overall per-\nformance.\n4.1. Implementation details\nWe use ResNet-50 [15] as the network backbone. The\noptimizer is AdamW [24] and the batch size is set to be\n16. The initial learning rate is 2e-4 for the transformer and\n2e-5 for the backbone. The weight decay is 1e-4 All trans-\nformer weights are initialized with Xavier-init [14], and the\nbackbone model is pretrained on ImageNet [8] with frozen\nbatch-norm layers [17]. We use data augmentation includ-\ning random horizontal, random crop, scale augmentation,\nresizing the input images whose shorter side is by 480 -\n800 pixels while the longer side is by at most 1333 pixels.\nWe train the model for 150 epochs and the learning rate\ndrops by a factor of 10 at the 100th epoch. In the ablation\nstudy, the model is ﬁrst pre-trained on CrowdHuman [33]\nand then ﬁne-tuned on MOT. When evaluating on the test\nset, we train our network on combination of CrowdHuman\nand MOT. More details are discussed in Appendix.\n4.2. MOT17 benchmark\nWe evaluate models on MOT17 under the private detec-\ntor setting. The results We evaluate models on MOT17 un-\nder the private detector setting. The results are shown in Ta-\nble 1. TransTrack achieves comparable results with the cur-\nrent state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of MOTP\nand FN. The excellent MOTP demonstrates TransTrack\ncan precisely locate objects in the image. The good FN\nscore represents that most objects are successfully detected.\nThose prove the success of introducing learned object query\ninto the pipeline. As for ID-switch, TransTrack is compara-\nble with the popular trackers, e.g., FairMOT [51] and Cen-\nterTrack [58], which proves the effectiveness of object fea-\nture query to associate adjacent frames. Although the ID-\nswitch score of TransTrack is inferior to SOTA methods, it\nis a promising direction to further improve the overall per-\nformance of TransTrack.\n5\n4.3. MOT20 benchmark\nWe evaluate models on MOT20 under the private de-\ntector setting. The results are shown in Table 1. MOT20\nincludes more crowded scenes than MOT17. Its more se-\nvere object occlusion and smaller object size bring more\nchallenges for object detection and tracking. Therefore,\nall methods show lower performance on MOT20 than on\nMOT17. But still, TransTrack achieves comparable re-\nsults with the current state-of-the-art methods on MOT20,\nin terms of detection metrics and association metrics.\n4.4. Ablation study\n4.4.1 Transformer Architecture\nWe ablate the effect of Transformer architecture. Four\ntransformer structures are put into comparison. Trans-\nformer follows the settings of DETR [5] detector, where\ntransformer is built on top of the feature maps of res5\nstage [15]. Transformer-DC5 increases the feature maps\nresolution. To be precise, we apply dilation convolution to\nres5 stage and remove a stride from the ﬁrst convolution of\nthis stage. Transformer-P3 adopts FPN [22] on the input\nfeature maps. The encoder of the Transformer is directly\nremoved from the whole pipeline for memory limitation.\nAfter removing the encoder, the learning rate of the back-\nbone could be raised to the same as transformers. Finally,\nwe also tried Deformable Transformer [60], which is a\nrecently proposed architecture to solve the issue of limited\nresolution in the transformer. Within plausible memory us-\nage, it fuses multiple-scale features into the whole encoder-\ndecoder pipeline and achieves excellent performance in the\ngeneral object detection dataset.\nThe quantitative results are shown in Table 2. The\nﬁnal performance of Transformer is only 55.4 MOTA.\nWith higher feature resolution, Transformer-DC5 yields\n3.6 MOTA improvement. However, it also leads to the\ndrawback of dilation convolution, such as big memory us-\nage. Transformer-P3 only outputs close performance as\nTransformer-DC5, saying that higher resolution than DC5\nfails to bring further performance gain. And the reason\nbehind this might be the absence of encoder blocks. At\nlast, Deformable Transformerfuses multiple-scale feature\ninto the whole encoder-decoder pipeline and achieves ex-\ncellent performance, up to 65.0 MOTA. Therefore, we use\nDeformable Transformer as the default architecture choice\nof TransTrack.\n4.4.2 Query in Decoder\nWe study the effect of what the input query is used. In the\ndetection task, an input query is generated from the input\nimage only [5, 60]. But in tracking, the knowledge of pre-\nviously detected objects is expected to be helpful, so we set\nArchitecture MOTA ↑ FP↓ FN↓ IDs↓\nTransformer [5] 55.4 7.4% 35.2% 2.0%\nTransformer-DC5 [5] 59.0 5.2% 34.0% 1.8%\nTransformer-P3 59.3 5.1% 33.8% 1.8%\nDeformable Transformer [60] 65.0 4.3% 30.3% 0.4%\nTable 2: Ablation study on Transformer architecture.\nOriginal transformer suffers from low feature resolution.\nDeformable DETR with multi-scale feature input achieves\nbest performance.\nQuery MOTA ↑ FP↓ FN↓ IDs↓\nObejct query 58.3 4.0% 29.7% 8.0%\nTrack query - 15.6% 93.8% 0.3%\nTrack query + Object query 65.0 4.3% 30.3% 0.4%\nTable 3: Ablation study on input query. Using only ob-\nject query obtains limited association performance. Using\nonly track query leads to numerous FN since it misses new-\ncoming objects. By using both object query and track query,\nthe detection and tracking performance are improved.\nexperiments to compare the model performance when ob-\nject query and track query are used or absent respectively.\nThe results are reported in Table 3.\nOnly object query. When only learned object query is in-\nput as decoder query, we adopt a naive pipeline where the\noutput detection boxes are associated according to their in-\ndex in the output set. Surprisingly, this solution achieves a\nnot bad performance by 58.3 MOTA. This is because each\nobject query predicts the object in a certain area on images,\nand most objects just move around a small distance in the\nvideo sequence. However, solely relying on the index in\nthe output set leads to non-negligible wrong matching, es-\npecially when the object moves through a long distance.\nWhen the object moves around a wide range, this pattern\nfails easily as visualized in Figure 4.\nOnly track query. When only the track query, which is\ngenerated from the previous frame, is input to the decoder,\nwe have no common detection results on the image. The\nvisualization in the second row of Figure 4 shows that this\nmethod is capable to associate the object with a large range\nof motion. Nevertheless, only the object that appears in the\nﬁrst frame can be tracked successively. For the whole video\nsequence, most of the objects will be missed and the FN\nmetric collapses as shown in the second row of Table 3.\nObject query + track query. As the default setting of\nTransTrack, both object query and track query are input to\nthe decoder. Now it can handle most failure cases in the\nprevious two cases with the help of the other query. Visu-\nalization in Figure 4 and performance reported in Table 3\nprove the giant improvement.\n6\nFigure 4: Visualization of TransTrack with different input query.1st row is only learned object query. 2nd row is only\nobject feature query from the previous frame. 3rd row is both learned object query and object feature query from the\nprevious frame. Only learned object query or object feature query from the previous frame causes ID switch case or missing\nobject case. TransTrack takes both as input query and exhibits best detection and tracking performance.\nMatching MOTA ↑ FP↓ FN↓ IDs↓\nPrevious 64.8 4.8% 29.8% 0.6%\nCurrent 65.0 4.3% 30.3% 0.4%\nTable 4: Ablation study of matching strategy of tracking\nboxes. Previous indicates directly inheriting the index of\ntrack query for box matching on the previous frame. Cur-\nrent indicates using optimal bipartite matching with current\nobject boxes.\n4.4.3 Matching strategy of tracking boxes\nTransTrack builds tracklets based on two sets of detection\nresults and box matching. To emphasize temporal corre-\nlation in tracking tasks, it is natural to consider match-\ning tracking boxes with previous frame objects. To ab-\nlate the inﬂuence of tracking boxes matching, we conduct\ntwo strategies. One way is to match initial tracking boxes\nto previous object boxes by optimal bipartite matching\n(Previous), in other words, the matching index is directly\nfrom the matching index of corresponding track queries.\nThe other strategy is to supervise the output of tracking\nAssociation MOTA ↑ FP↓ FN↓ IDs↓\nHungarian 65.0 4.3% 30.3% 0.4%\nNMS 65.0 4.3% 30.3% 0.4%\nTable 5: Ablation study of box association.

The results are shown in Table 4. The\nresults show that bipartite matching with previous frame ob-\njects does not help to void ID switch (0.6% v.s. 0.4%). This\nshows that the inherit the property of the query-key mech-\nanism could well locate the position of the corresponding\nobject on the current frame already.\n4.4.4 Bounding Box Association\nWe study the effect of different box association post-\nprocessing strategies. We choose the classic Hungarian al-\n7\nMotion model MOTA ↑ FP↓ FN↓ IDs↓ 4xIDs↓\nNone 64.4 4.3% 30.3% 1.0% 1.2%\nKalman ﬁlter 64.9 4.3% 30.4% 0.4% 1.0%\nTrack query(Ours) 65.0 4.3% 30.3% 0.4% 0.5%\nTable 6: The effect of motion model . All models use\nDETR as detectors. For None, object box is associated\nby IoU similarity. For Kalman ﬁlter , the output bound-\ning boxes are processed by Kalman ﬁlter. Ours follows the\ntwo-query-set setting where track query is used to associate\nacross-frame objects.\ngorithm [18] and the NMS merging method used in [58, 25].\nResults are shown in Table 5. It suggests both two strategies\nshow equivalent effect in the box association stage.\n4.5. Comparisons with other trackers\nTwo commonly used signals to upgrade a detector to\na tracker are motion and appearance features. So “detec-\ntor + motion model” and “detector + Re-ID” are widely-\nused and intuitive methods, thus it is necessary to compare\nTransTrack with these two models to have a clear idea about\nhow much TransTrack gains from its design except for im-\nprovement from the detector it replies on.\n4.5.1 Motion model\nWe combine the widely-used Kalman ﬁlter and DETR to\nbuild a “detector + motion model” tracker. The results\nare shown in Table 6. Kalman ﬁlter and our method pro-\nvide similar IDs performance. We explain that the MOT17\ndataset is the video sequence of high frame rate (14-30\nFPS), where the object motion between two adjacent frames\nis minor. Therefore, different association methods make no\nbig difference. However, when we sample one frame every\n4 frames, the object motion becomes larger, then the im-\nprovement brought by the feature query is obvious (0.5%\nvs. 1.0%), shown in the last column of Table 6. Similar\nphenomenons are discussed in [58].\n4.5.2 Re-ID features\nTo maintain the joint-detection-and-tracking paradigm, we\ndo not implement an independent Re-ID model but use the\nRe-ID branch to formulate a “detector + Re-ID” tracker.\nAs features generated in the detector have conﬂicts with\nappearance-based Re-ID features [51], we study the inﬂu-\nence of using an independent Re-ID passway, e.g., a cross-\nattention layer in the decoder. The two patterns are illus-\ntrated in Figure 5. The results are included in Table 7.\nIt agrees that when passed through an independent pass-\nway, the Re-ID feature brings better results than using a\nobject query\nCross-Attention\nobject \nfeature\ndetection \nbox\nre-ID \nfeature\nCross-\nAttention\ndetection \nbox\nre-ID \nfeature\nCross-\nAttention\nobject query\n(a) shared feature (b) independent feature\nFigure 5: Two designs to introduce Re-ID into DETR.\nThe left one uses a shared feature from a single cross-\nattention layer to train detection and re-identiﬁcation.

When passing Re-\nID features to an independent cross-attention layer, the per-\nformance is better than using shared cross-attention layer\nfor detection features and Re-ID features. However, this\nalso results in degradation of detector, so the overall perfor-\nmance does not beat default TransTrack.\nshared module with detection features. However, the overall\nMOTA score is not improved against default TransTrack.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this work, we set up a joint-detection-and-tracking\nMOT pipeline, TransTrack, based on the transformer. It\nuses the learned object query as input to detects objects\nand track query, which is the features the from previous\nframe, to propagate previously detected objects to the fol-\nlowing frames. TransTrack is the ﬁrst work solving MOT in\nsuch a paradigm. It achieves a competitive 74.5 MOTA on\nthe MOT17 dataset and 64.5 MOTA on a more challenging\nMOT20 dataset. We expect it to provide a novel perspective\nand insight to the MOT community.\n8\nAppendix\nA. Training Data\nWe follow the common practice of the state-of-the-\nart MOT methods [58] to train TransTrack on CrowdHu-\nman [33] ﬁrst and then ﬁne-tune the model on MOT17.\nWe conduct a comparison to study the effect of the ex-\nternal CrowdHuman data. The result is reported in Ta-\nble 8. Only using the training set of MOT17 merely obtains\n61.6 MOTA. When ﬁrst pre-trained on CrowdHuman then\ntrained on MOT17, the performance achieves 64.8 MOTA.\nIt suggests adding external data boosts the model perfor-\nmance signiﬁcantly.\nPre-train Fine-tune MOTA ↑ FP↓ FN↓ IDs↓\nCH - 53.8 13.0% 32.3% 1.0%\n- MOT17 61.6 3.4% 34.2% 0.9%\nCH MOT17 65.0 4.3% 30.3% 0.4%\nTable 8: Ablation study on pre-training data. The ﬁrst\nrow is the model trained only on CrowdHuman dataset. The\nsecond row indicates model trained on the training set of\nMOT dataset only. The third shows the performance when\nthe model is trained on CrowdHuman ﬁrst and then ﬁne-\ntuned on MOT dataset. All models are evaluated on the\nvalidation set of MOT17 dataset.\nBesides the pre-training data settings, we ﬁnd the data\nused for ﬁne-tuning is also critical. We conduct an abla-\ntion study on it and the results are shown in Table 9. Inter-\nestingly, ﬁne-tuning on the combination of CrowdHuman\nand MOT shows better performance than ﬁne-tuning on the\nMOT dataset only.\nDataset Pre-train Fine-tune MOTA ↑ FP↓ FN↓ IDs↓\nMOT17 CH MOT17 68.4 22137 152064 3942\nCH CH+MOT17 74.5 28323 112137 3663\nMOT20 CH MOT20 57.4 32921 184047 3705\nCH CH+MOT20 64.5 28566 151377 3565\nTable 9: Ablation study on ﬁne-tuning data. For each\nbenchmark, the ﬁrst row is the model ﬁne-tuned only on\nMOT train dataset. The second row indicates the model\nﬁne-tuned on the combination of CrowdHuman and MOT\ntraining set. All models are evaluated on the test set of MOT\nbenchmark.\nB. Accuracy vs. Speed\nWe analyze the inference speed of TransTrack. The time\ncost is measured using a single Tesla V100 GPU. Table 10\nshows the effect of number of decoders. Increasing de-\ncoders hurts inference speed, for example, from 1 decoder\nto 6, FPS decreases from 15FPS to 10FPS. However, more\ndecoders signiﬁcantly boost MOTA performance. There-\nfore, we choose 6 as the default decoder number. Table 11\nshows the effect of input image size. Gradually increasing\ninput image size, MOTA performance is saturated when the\nshort-side of the input image is by 800 pixels so we set it as\nthe default setting in TransTrack.\nDecoders MOTA ↑ FP↓ FN↓ IDs↓ FPS\n1 47.0 10.0% 40.0% 3.0% 15\n3 64.3 3.3% 31.4% 1.0% 12\n6 65.0 4.3% 30.3% 0.4% 10\nTable 10: Ablation study on number of decoders.

Therefore, we\nchoose 6 decoders as default.\nShort-side MOTA ↑ FP↓ FN↓ IDs↓ FPS\n540 pix 62.4 3.9% 32.8% 0.9% 14\n800 pix 65.0 4.3% 30.3% 0.4% 10\n1080 pix 59.2 4.7% 35.0% 1.1% 7\nTable 11: Ablation study on input image size.
