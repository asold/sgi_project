Introduction\nCVT havs been widely adopted in high-voltage neutral grounding power networks to provide\nvoltage signal with an apprciated accuracy to the energy metering system, relay protection sys-\ntem etc., due to its overwhelming advantages such as small volume, light weight, less mainte-\nnance and high margin of electric field intensity [1–3]. In China, CVT gradually occupies the\nmajority of the market share of voltage measurement in from the begining of the 1980s, espe-\ncially in the recent AC/DC ultrahigh-voltage project and the VSC-HVDC system [4, 5].\nThe hope that CVT can provide harmonic voltage signals with the same accuracy as that\nunder the system fundamental frequency has been proven to be an illusion, via both the theo-\nretical analysis and experimental verification; therefore, the relevant standard clearly states\nthat “CVT cannot be used for harmonic voltage measurement”. Reference [6] discusses the\nproblem of a CVT in measuring harmonics voltage, and notes that the measurement error\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02052 31 November 6, 2018 1 / 26\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Le J, Zhang H, Gao C, Zhou Q (2018)\nHarmonic voltage measureme nt error of the\ncapacitor voltage transform er.

Based\non the HEC of individual element, the influences of the burden rate and the damper structure\non the frequency response of the transformation ratio of a CVT are analyzed quantitatively in\n[7], and the validity of the HEC formation and measurement error analysis are verified\nthrough simulation and field test of a 400kV CVT with a resonance-type damper. However, a\nCVT with a speedy saturation damper that is applied more widely in power system [8] has not\nbeen involved in this research. Reference [9] establishes the HEC of a CVT with a speedy satu-\nration damper and, on this basis defines the HVME, while the mechanism for the error has\nnot been studied. The influence laws of several factors that govern the harmonic measurement\nerror of CVT are researched comprehensively in, e.g., [10–12]. References [10] and [11] focus\non the effect of the stray and coupling capacitance on the harmonic voltage transfer function\nof the CVT, and [12] confirms that the measurement error mainly comes from the excitation\nimpedance and the capacitance divider. Unfortunately, these studies are case specific and take\nonly some of the influence factors into consideration, thus being unable to serve as the general\nbasis for the quantitative analysis of the HVME. It shall be noted that method based on fractal\ntheory [13, 14] is very beneficial for the formulation of eqivalent circuit of CVT.\nBesides the theoretical analysis, several researches have focused on the experiment techo-\nnology for testing the HVME of CVTs. To learn the frequency response characteristics of the\ntransformation ratio of a CVT, reference [15] proposes to apply harmonic voltage with a lower\namplitude to the primary winding or the secondary winding of a CVT. Although a high-volt-\nage harmonic source is no longer needed, the application of this scheme is very limited since\nthat most CVTs do not allow to be energized from the secondary winding. In [16], an experi-\nmental arrangement that applies harmonic voltages to the midpoint of the capacitor voltage\ndivider is presented, with the aim to derive the harmonic transformation ratio of a CVT. How-\never, a harmonic source with high voltage level and large power capacity is still required.\nIt is well known that a resistor or a capacitor voltage divider is the most suitable candidate\nfor the harmonics measuremnt in high-voltage systems. Unfortunately, these specialized\ndevices are large in size and very expensive [17, 18] and are therefore inconvenient for field\nexperiments. Some researchers have independently proposed to insert current transformers\ninto the internal branches of a CVT [19, 20]. The harmonic voltage on the primary side can\nthen be accurately measured according to outputs of the current transformers and the imped-\nance-frequency characteristics of the circuit branches into which the current transformers are\ninserted. However, these methods are not applicable to CVTs that are already in operation.\nThis paper studies the harmonic voltage measurement error of a CVT in a comprehensive\nand in-depth way and, on this basis, presents a practical error correction method that can\nimprove the harmonic measurement accuracy to an extent acceptable in engineering. The fol-\nlowing innovative results are achieved: 1) In both the quantitative analysis and the influence\nlaw study of the measurement error, we concentrate on the resonant frequencies instead of\nanalyzing the law of the influence factor individually. This change in disposal facilitates the\nrevelation of the mechanism for measurement error greatly; 2) A physical experimental plat-\nform for testing the HVME of CVT is established. We propose a simple and effective scheme\nto address the problem of harmonic voltage amplification and attenuation, therefore improv-\ning the safety of the experimental platform and the accuracy of the experimental results; 3) We\npresent a novel harmonic voltage measurement method based on the alternating current/\ndirect current (AC/DC) filters for the high-voltage DC (HVDC) power transmission systems\n[21, 22]. This simple and practical method can provide accurate harmonic voltage reference\nsignal for the determination of the HVME of CVT in high-voltage systems.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the HECs of CVTs with\ndifferent types of dampers are established. Section 3 presents the calculation of the resonant\nHarmonic voltage measurem ent error of the capacitor voltage transforme r\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02052 31 November 6, 2018 2 / 26\nfrequencies of the HECs. The harmonic voltage measurement performances of CVTs with dif-\nferent types of dampers are compared in Section 4. Section 5 presents the principle and appli-\ncation of the error correction method, simulation results verifying the effectiveness of this\nmethod are also provided in this section. Section 6 presents the scheme for the development of\na physical experimental platform and the experiment results of the harmonic measurement\nerror of a 35-kV CVT with a fast-saturation damper. Section 7 presents a method for measur-\ning the harmonic voltage of HVDC power system and verifies the validity of the harmonic\nequivalent circuit of a 525-kV CVT. Section 8 applies the error correction method to correct\nthe harmonic measurement error of a 35-kV CVT and a 525-kV CVT. Section 9 presents the\nconclusions.\n2. Harmonic equivalent circuit of CVT\n2.1 Harmonic equivalent circuit\nAs shown in Fig 1, the CVT system mainly consists of a capacitive voltage divider, an electro-\nmagnetic unit and the burden. The capacitive voltage divider is composed of the high-voltage\ncapacitor C\n1\nand the medium-voltage capacitor C\n2\n. The electromagnetic unit includes the\ncompensation reactor L\nC\n, the intermediate transformer T, and the damper Z\nf\n. The damper can\nbe connected to any one of the secondary windings.\nBy ignoring the carrier extraction coil and converting the parameter values to the primary\nside, the harmonic equivalent circuits of the CVT with a resonant damper [7] and that with a\nspeedy saturation damper have been built and are shown in Fig 2.\nAs seen in Fig 2, the equivalent circuit of the compensation reactor is composed of the\ninductance L\nLc\nand the resistance R\nL\nof the winding, the inductance L\nLce\nand the resistance R\nLce\nof the iron core, and the stray capacitance C\nLc\n.

C\nT1\nis\nthe primary winding stray capacitance, and the stray capacitances of the secondary windings\nare ignored due to the relative small numbers of secondary winding turns, L\nz\nand R\nz\nare the\nburden inductance and resistance, respectively.\nThe major difference between the two equivalent circuits shown in Fig 2 is the HECs of the\ndampers with different structures. Specifically, in Fig 2(A) the HEC of the CVT with a speedy\nsaturation damper, L\nf\n, R\nf\n, and C\nf\nare the inductance, resistance and stray capacitance of the\ndamper, respectively. As for the HEC of the CVT with a resonant damper, R\nf1\n, R\nf2\nand R\nfe\nare\nthe resistances of the winding and iron of the damper transformer, respectively, L\nf1\n, L\nf2\nand\nM\nf1f2\nare the self-inductance and mutual inductance of the windings of the damper trans-\nformer, and C\nf\nand R\nf\nare respectively the capacitance and nonlinear resistance of the damper,\nas shown in Fig 2(B).\n2.2 Calculation of the element parameter values\nThe parameter values of the elements in the HEC of the compensation reactor can be obtained\nvia the corresponding experiments, based on the circuit shown in Fig 3.\nTo acquire the values of R\nLc\nand R\nLce\n, we by turn inject a DC current and two AC currents\nwith a frequency of 50 Hz and 100 Hz respectively, with the RMS values being the same as the\nrated current of the primary winding of the intermediate transformer, into the circuit and\nthen record the voltage U\nLc\nunder each test and the power loss under each of the AC current\ninjection test.\nFig 2.

Next, we establish the simulation model of the compensation reactor\nusing the Ansoft software according to its actual physical structure and dimensions; then, the\nvalue of the stray capacitance C\nLc\ncan be estimated through proper selection of the material\nattribute and the setting of the boundary conditions.\nAs for the elements in the HEC of the intermediate transformer, the values of the leakage\ninductance L\nT1\n, L\nT2\n, and L\nTf\nand the leakage resistance R\nT1\n, R\nT2\n, and R\nTf\nof the corresponding\nwinding, the excitation inductance L\nTm\nand the resistance R\nTm\ncan all be known from the\nnameplate values provided by the manufacturer. The value of the stray capacitances C\nT1\ncan be\nacquired in the same way as that for the estimation of C\nLc\n.\nThe burden inductance L\nz\nand resistance R\nz\ncan be calculated by solving:\nR\nz\n¼\n1\n2\nU\n2\nzN\nZS\nzN\n� cosφ � k\n2\nz\nð2Þ\nL\nz\n¼\n1\n2\n�\n1\n2pf\n1\nU\n2\nzN\nZS\nzN\n� sinφ � k\n2\nz\nð3Þ\nwhere U\nzN\n= 100=\nffiffi ffi\n3\np\nV and S\nzN\n= 100 VA are the rated voltage and rated capacity of the mea-\nsurement and protection secondary winding, respectively. η is the burden rate and cosφ is the\npower factor of the burden, which has a normal value of 0.8 lagging. f\n1\n= 50 Hz, and k\nz\nis the\nopen-circuit transformation ratio of the voltage between the primary winding and the two sec-\nondary windings of the intermediate transformer.\nThe value of the inductance L\nf\nand the resistance R\nf\nof the speedy saturation damper shown\nin Fig 2(A) can be easily calculated based on the actual values of these two elements provided\nby the manufacturer and the open-circuit transformation ratio of the voltage between the\nFig 3.

Similarly, the\nvalue of the stray capacitances C\nf\ncan be estimated using the Ansoft software. The situation is\nrelatively complex for the resonant damper shown in Fig 2(B), the transformer winding resis-\ntances R\nf1\nand R\nf2\ncan be obtained via the four-point measurement method, i.e., injecting a DC\ncurrent with a value that is the rated current of the primary winding of the transformer into\neach of the windings. The values of C\nf\nand R\nf\ncan be known from the nameplate, and the values\nof the iron core resistance R\nfe\n, the winding self-inductanceL\nf1\nandL\nf2\n, and the winding mutual\ninductance M\nf1f2\ncan be determined by conducting regular short-circuit and open-circuit tests\non the damper transformer.\n2.3 Parameter value calculation results\nReference [7] provides all the parameter values of the HEC of a 400kV CVT with a resonant\ndamper; we summarize the parameter values of all the elements besides this damper in Table 1\nand specificlly list those of the filter in the left column of Table 2. Although we have obtained\nthe parameter values of the elements of another 400kV CVT with a speedy saturation damper\nusing the method introduced in the above subsection, for the purpose of performance compar-\nison, the parameter values listed in Table 1 are used for the elements except for the speedy satu-\nration damper, while those of this damper are separately given in the right column of Table 2.\n3. Resonance mode analysis\nUnder the system fundamental frequency, a series resonance in the circuit, which is inherently\nformulated by the electromagnetic unit and the capacitive voltage divider of the CVT, can\nmaintain a constant secondary-side output voltage under any burden condition, thus guaran-\nteeing a satisfying voltage measurement accuracy. It is now well known that the large error in\nthe measurement of harmonic voltage using a CVT originates from several resonances that are\nformulated by the stray capacitances and the corresponding inductive element in the circuit.\nHowever, the characteristics of the individual resonance mode, such as the resonant frequency\nand the circuit element involved, have not yet been researched comprehensively.\nTable 1.

Frequency-response characteristics of the transformation ratio\nThe simulation models of CVTs with different types of dampers have been built using the\nPSCAD software. Fig 6 and Fig 7 respectively illustrates the simulated frequency response\ncharacteristics of the voltage transformation ratio. In these figures, the x-axis is at the logarith-\nmic scale, and the y-axis of the amplitude-frequen cy response figures is in units of dB.

These results\nshow excellent agreement with the analysis in Section 3.1, wherein the calculated resonance\nfrequencies of the two series resonance modes is respectively 11.8 Hz and 668 Hz. The predic-\ntion of the existence of the parallel resonance mode is also well proven by the third extreme\nvalue point, with the amplitudes being smaller than 0 dB in Fig 6(A), and the simulated reso-\nnance frequency of 1550 Hz is very close to the calculated value of 1544.4 Hz.\n4.2 CVT with a resonant-type damper\nSimilarly, we conduct a comparison of the simulated results (shown in Fig 7) with the theoreti-\ncal analysis results (listed in Table 3) of the frequency response characteristic of the CVT with\na resonant-type damper; the conclusions are summarized in Table 4.\nTable 4 shows that the correctness of the theoretical analysis regarding the characteristics of\nthe resonance modes of the HEC, including the resonant type and resonant frequency, is\nproven by the simulated frequency response characteristics\n4.3 Harmonic voltage measurement error analysis\nBased on the theoretical analysis and simulation results in the above sections, it can be con-\ncluded that if we use the rated voltage transformation ratio at the system fundamental fre-\nquency (50 Hz in this paper) to calculate the harmonic voltage at the primary side of the CVT,\na large error in either the measured amplitude or the phase is inevitable due to the serious non-\nlinear behavior of and the large gap between the actual and rated values in the amplitude and\nphase of the transformation ratio frequency response, which is governed by the inherent reso-\nnance modes of the HEC of the CVT.\nFig 5.

Harmonic measurement error correction method\nAt present, CVT is still the most widely used voltage measurement device in high-voltage systems,\nso it is of important practical value to study the practical HVME correction method to provide rel-\natively accurate and reliable harmonic voltage measurement results. The key to improving the\nmeasurement accuracy is to accurately obtain the frequency response characteristic of the trans-\nformation ratio of CVT. This paper adopts the curve fitting method to fit the amplitude-frequency\nFig 6. Frequency response character istics of the ratio of the CVT with a speedy saturatio n damper.

Fig\n6(A) shows that the amplitude-frequency characteristic at the resonance frequency has a rapid\nchange and thus brings great difficulty to curve fitting. Therefore, we divide the fitting process\ninto two steps. First, the resonant frequency is predicted, and then the frequency response charac-\nteristic is fitted piecewise, taking the resonance frequency as the boundary point.\n5.1 Prediction of resonance frequency\nThe L-M-type BP neural network is adopted to predict the resonance frequency and the trans-\nformation ratio amplitude at the resonance frequency. Within the frequency range (less than\n10000 Hz), the transformation ratio frequency response of the CVT with a speedy saturation\ndamper has three resonance points; therefore, the output node number of the neural network\nnumber is 6, among which three nodes correspond to the three resonance frequencies and the\nremaining three nodes output the amplitudes of the transformation ratios at the resonance fre-\nquencies. The parameter values provided by the manufacturers, as shown in Table 1 and\nTable 2, are taken as the input variables. These variables are denoted with “\np\n”, and 17 input\nvariables are obtained in total.\nTaking the typical values of the variables in Table 1 and Table 2 as the mean values and 2%\nof the mean values as the variance values, 100 groups of value samples are generated based on\nthe normal distribution. Based on these values, the corresponding HEC is established in\nPSCAD to carry out the simulation calculation, and 100 groups of the amplitude-frequency\nresponse characteristics of the transformation ratio are obtained.\nThe training set is obtained by randomly selecting 50 groups of amplitude-frequency\nresponse characteristics, 25 groups of which are used to determine the suitable hidden layer\nnumber of the neural network, and the remaining 25 groups are taken as the validation sets.\nThe commonly used leave-one-out cross method is used to determine the node number in the\nhidden layer, and the best node number of the hidden layer of the neural network is 12.\nTable 5 presents the prediction results of the resonance frequency and the transformation\nratio amplitude at the resonance frequency using the well-trained neural network. It can be\nseen that the designed neural network can fairly well predict the resonance frequency and the\ntransformation ratio amplitude at the resonance frequency.\n5.2 The fitting of the amplitude-frequency response characteristic\nAfter predicting the resonance frequency, the transformation ratio amplitude-frequenc y response\ncharacteristic is divided into several segments, taking the resonance frequency as the boundary\npoint, and the corresponding neural networks are designed to fit these segments. The CVT with a\nspeedy saturation damper has three resonance frequency points, so the amplitude-frequenc y\nresponse characteristic is divided into four segments, as shown in Fig 6(A). The L-M-type BP neu-\nral network is adopted to fit the amplitude-frequenc y response characteristic in these segments,\nthe inputs and parameter samples in these segments are the same as the predicted resonance fre-\nquency in Part A of this section, and the node number of the hidden layer and the design of the\noutput unit are different. For each segment of the amplitude-frequency characteristics, 0.004\ndecade (dec) is taken as the frequency interval to determine the corresponding output node num-\nber, and the leave-one-out cross method is used to determine the node number of the hidden\nlayer in the neural network. The neural network design results are shown in Table 6.\n5.3 Analysis of the fitting results\nA group of validation parameters are selected from the validation set, and Fig 7 presents the fit-\nting results. Table 7 lists the comparison of the fitting results to the actual values within a part\nHarmonic voltage measurem ent error of the capacitor voltage transforme r\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02052 31 November 6, 2018 11 / 26\nof the frequency. The decision coefficient for the amplitude-frequency characteristic curve fit-\nting in Fig 8 is 0.99828. The prediction and fitting method can fairly well realize the prediction\nof the transformation ratio amplitude-frequency characteristic of the CVT and thus improve\nthe accuracy of CVT harmonic voltage amplitude measurement.\n6.

Considering the minimum voltage level of a CVT is a line voltage\nof 35-kV, a small capacity step-up transformer is employed to increase the harmonic voltage to\n35-kV.\nAs shown in Fig 10 the arrangement of platform, a CVT with a speedy saturation damper,\nan electromagnetic voltage transformer (TV) and a resistive CVT (RCVT) are connected in\nparallel to one phase of the step-up transformer on the 35-kV side. The experiment is con-\nducted to simultaneously analysis the harmonic measurement error of the CVT and that of the\nTV. The RCVT provides the actual harmonic voltage measurement on the 35-kV side to deter-\nmine the harmonic measurement error. The outputs of these three devices are simultaneously\nconnected to a Fluke 1760 power quality analyzer.\nFig 11 shows the amplitude-frequency response characteristics of the transformation ratio\nof the RCVT obtained by simulations, where the horizontal axis corresponds to the logarith-\nmic scale frequency. We can see that the RCVT has a very wide frequency band with a rated\nfundamental transformation ratio of 100V/35,000V = 0.002857, thus can be used as the stan-\ndard measurment device in the experiment.\n6.2 Analysis of the experimental results and improvement plan\nThe 10-kV harmonic generator is controlled to output the rated fundamental voltage superim-\nposed with the 2\nnd\n-31\nst\nharmonic voltages with amplitudes of 1 kV (line voltage). The load of\nthe RCVT is the input resistance of the power quality analyzer (1-MO), and the loads of the\nCVT and VT are the same. Experiments are conducted under four sets of loading conditions:\n(1) power factor: 1; load: 100% of the rated load (denoted by 100%+1); (2) power factor: 0.8\nlagging; load: 100% of the rated load (denoted by 100%+0.8); (3) power factor: 1; load: 50% of\nthe rated load (denoted by 50%+1); (4) power factor: 0.8 lagging; load: 50% of the rated load\n(denoted by 50%+0.8). Table 8 shows the 2\nnd\n-15\nth\nharmonic voltage measurements on the sec-\nondary side of the RCVT, CVT and VT (due to the limited space, only the results for three of\nthe four sets of loading conditions are presented).\nTable 4.

However, Table 8\nshows that under each loading conditions, the amplitude of the harmonic voltage on the sec-\nondary side of the RCVT differs significantly from the theoretical value and the amplitude of\nthe harmonic voltages of some orders (e.g., 2\nnd\n-5\nth\n) are considerably amplified. For example,\nthe amplitude of the 4\nth\nharmonic voltage under the 100%+1 loading condition is 22.796 V.\nThis result indicates that the 4\nth\nharmonic voltage on the 35-kV side could be as high as 7.979\nkV; this amplified harmonic voltage may threaten the safety of the experimental system.

The harmonic voltage with a too low amplitude may decrease the accuracy of the exper-\niments to a certain extent. The phenomenon of harmonic voltages amplification and attenua-\ntion suggests that the orginal experimental platform scheme should be improved.\nTable 9 lists the specific parameter values of the single-phase 10-kV/35-kV step-up trans-\nformer adopted in the original experiment platfrom. We can see that this transformer has a rel-\natively small capacity and the short-circuit impedances under higher frequencies are very\nlarge. We decide to replace this transformer with a single-phase 10-kV/35-kV oil-immersed\ntransformer, of which the specific parameter values are listed in Table 9.\nFig 12 shows the inherent impedance of two step-up transformers with different capacities\nas well as the total impedance of the experimental platform circuit (observed from point A in\nFig 9) and the amplitude-frequency response characteristics of the total load of the experimen-\ntal platform (observed from point B in Fig 9) for these two transformers.\nFig 8.

In addition, the\namplitude of the transformer impedance (inductive) is very close to that of the load impedance\n(capacitive) at point A in Fig 12 (where the frequency is approximately 200 Hz). Therefore, the\nexperimental platform circuit will resonate, significantly amplifying the lower-order (2\nnd\n-5\nth\n)\nharmonic voltages near 200 Hz on the 35-kV side. This phenomenon is consistent with the\nexperimental results shown in Table 8, which also demonstrates the safety risk and poor mea-\nsurement accuracy of the experimental platform equipped with the original step-up trans-\nformer. In comparison, when applying a step-up transformer with a capacity of 1000 kVA, the\ntransformer impedance is always smaller than the load impedance within the entire frequency\nrange investigated. The simulation results show that for this transformer, no harmonic voltage\namplification or attenuation occurs on the 35-kV side. This finding indicates that the experi-\nmental platform with a large-capacity step-up transformer is feasible.\n6.3 Harmonic measurement error of the35-kV CVT\nTable 10 lists the experimental results with respect to the secondary side of the CVT obtained\nunder the 100%+1 loading condition.

Fig 14 shows the amplitude-frequency response\ncharacteristics of the CVT transformation ratio obtained using PSCAD simulation.\nThe curve shown in Fig 14 has three extreme points, which correspond to frequencies of\napproximately 3 Hz, 500 Hz and 650 Hz.

Field experiment on measuring the harmonic measurement error\nof a CVT\nIt is hard to perfrom the experiment on CVTs with voltage ratings of 110kV or above in labo-\nratory, due to the technical difficulty and high investment in the development of a harmonic\nvoltage generator with a high voltage level and a large power capacity. A convenient and prac-\ntical method, which plays the same role as that of the RCVT, is the foundation to successfully\nconduct the field experiments on the harmonic voltage measurement error of CVTs with high\nvoltage ratings.\n7.1 Harmonic measurement method for high voltage systems\nWe propose a harmonic voltage measurement method that is used exclusively for HVDC and\nUHVDC power transmission systems with paralleling AC/DC filters. In this method, the cur-\nrent i\nzH\nof the filter is measured and then decomposed using e.g. FFT technology. Then, based\non the frequency characteristics of the filter impedance provided by the manufacturer, the\namplitude and phase of the individual harmonic voltage can be calculated by:\nU\nSðhÞ\nffφ\nS ðhÞ\n¼ I\nZH ðhÞ\n� Z\nðhÞ\nffðφ\nðhÞ\nþ y\nZH ðhÞ\nÞ\nwhere I\nZH(h)\nand θ\nZH(h)\nis the RMS value and phase angle of the h\nth\nharmonic component of\nthe current in the filter, respectively; Z\n(h)\nand φ\n(h)\nis respectively the amplitude and phase angle\nof the h\nth\nharmonic impedance of the filter; and U\nS(h)\nand φ\nS(h)\nis respectively the RMS value\nand phase angle of the h\nth\nharmonic component of the voltage of the bus to which the filter\nconnects.\nWe can see from the above explanation that the proposed harmonic voltage measurement\nmethod is of simple calculation and easy implementation since that it requires the real-time\ncurrent and impedance frequency characteristic of the AC/DC filter only. It should be noted\nthat a current transformer generally has an appreciated frequency response characteristic to\nprovide accurate harmonic current measurement signals [23].\n7.2 Application of the harmonic measurement method\nA back-to-back DC power transmission system that connects a 330-kV AC system with a\n500-kV AC system is examined in this paper. A double-tuned 12/24 AC filter and an AC3\nhigh-pass filter, of which the elements rated values are listed in Table 11, are connected in par-\nallel to the 500-kV and 330-kV AC buses of the converter station, respectively. Simulation\nmodel of this DC power transmission system has been established using PSCAD software, as\nshown in Fig 15.\nThe fault recorder of the converter station has been triggered manually when the DC power\ntransmission system is in stable operation. Three sets of operation data during several funda-\nmental frequency cycles have been recorded, including: (1) The voltages of the buses to which\nTable 11.

This data set is used to adjust the setting of the\nsimulation model accurately; (2) The currents of the two filters that are used to calculate the\nharmonic voltages of the AC buses; (3) The voltages on the secondary side of the CVTs that\nare used to calculate the harmonic measurement error. Fig 16 shows the recorded waveforms\nof the filter currents and the CVT voltages.\nThe individual harmonic voltage and the total harmonic voltage of each of the two AC\nbuses are obtained by two ways: 1) performing simulation using the first set of data, and 2) uti-\nlizing the proposed measurement method with the second set of data. Fig 17 shows the wave-\nform of the total harmonic voltage of the 500-kV bus, and Table 12 compares the amplitude of\nthe harmonic voltage of each order (only those of the 2\nnd\n-15\nth\nharmonic voltages are pre-\nsented) for the two methods.\nFig 17 demonstrates that the total harmonic voltage obtained from the simulation is in very\ngood agreement with that calculated by the filter currents. Table 12 shows that the error of the\nproposed method for the harmonic component with relatively large amplitude (e.g., the 3\nrd\n,\nFig 15.

Using the method proposed\nin Section 2, the HEC of this CVT has been established and the parameter values of the circuit\nelements have been obtained. The amplitude-frequency response characteristic of the transfor-\nmation ratio (k(h), h is the harmonic order) of this CVT is obtained through simulation and\nthe third set of the recorded data (U\ncvt2\n(h)) presented in the previous section are used jointly\nto calculate the amplitude of the individual harmonic voltage of the 500-kV bus (U\ncvt1\n(h)). The\nproposed harmonic measurement method is employed to provide the actual values of the\namplitudes of these harmonic voltages (U\nfilter\n(h)) of the 500-kV bus. Table 13 lists the calcula-\ntion results of the harmonic voltages with the amplitudes exceeding 100 V.\nIn Table 13, the error of the calculated amplitude is less than 2% for each harmonic compo-\nnent, which demonstrates the accuracy of the obtained frequency response characteristics of\nthe CVT. Thus, these experimental results confirm the validity of the theoretical research\nresults concerning the harmonic equivalent circuit presented in Section 2 of this paper.\n8. Application of the harmonic measurement error correction\nmethod\nThe neural network-based error correction method for harmonic measurement proposed in\nSection 5 is applied to the 35-kV and 525-kV CVTs with speedy saturation dampers. Table 14\nlists the predicted resonant frequencies, and Table 15 compares the harmonic measurement\nerrors before and after the correction.\nFrom Table 14 it can be known that the error correction method can predict the resonant\nfrequencies of CVTs with different voltage levels accurately, except for the relatively large error\nin predicting the highest resonant frequencies. Table 15 reveals that the error in the calculation\nof the harmonic voltage on the primary side based on the fundamental transformation ratio is\nvery large. For example for the 525-kV CVT, the error of the amplitude of the 11\nth\nharmonic\nvoltage reaches 63.57% before correction. While after correction, the measurement errors are\neffectively reduced, for example the error of the 11\nth\nharmonic voltage reduces to only -0.48%.\nTable 13.

Conclusions\nThis paper studies the mechanism for HVME and the correction method of CVTs with differ-\nent types of dampers. The CVT measurement error is mainly derived from the multiple reso-\nnant modes excited by the equivalent circuit under the harmonic condition. Series resonance\ncauses the transformation ratio amplitude at the resonance frequency to be larger than the\nrated value, which makes the harmonic voltage amplitude at the primary side to be smaller\nthan the actual value, and even less than 1/5 of the actual value at most. However, the opposite\nis true for the parallel resonance; the calculated value under some frequencies can even reach\nmore than dozens of times the actual value. The influence of dampers with different structures\non the HVME of the CVT varies greatly. A speedy saturation damper makes little contribution\nto the HVME.\nThrough the analysis of the influence of the CVT resonant modes and different structures\nof dampers on the HVME, this paper presents a practical HVME error correction method\nbased on neural network technology. The simulation results show that it can effectively fit the\ntransformation ratio amplitude-frequen cy response characteristic curves of the CVT and\nimprove the harmonic measurement accuracy of the CVT to some extent.\nThe experiments results verify the validity of the established harmonic equivalent circuit,\nthe resonant frequency analysis, and the resonant frequency calculation. Relatively large error\nis inevitably introduced by CVTs to measure harmonic voltages. This error can be reduced to\na certain extent using the harmonic measurement error correction method proposed in this\npaper, thus provides a basis for more better understanding the harmonic voltage characteris-\ntics of high-voltage systems.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: Jian Le.\nTable 15.
