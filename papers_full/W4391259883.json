  "abstract": "Abstract Purpose This article explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate administrative tasks in healthcare, alleviating the burden on clinicians caused by electronic medical records. Potential LLMs offer opportunities in clinical documentation, prior authorization, patient education, and access to care. They can personalize patient scheduling, improve documentation accuracy, streamline insurance prior authorization, increase patient engagement, and address barriers to healthcare access. Caution However, integrating LLMs requires careful attention to security and privacy concerns, protecting patient data, and complying with regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It is crucial to acknowledge that LLMs should supplement, not replace, the human connection and care provided by healthcare professionals. Conclusion By prudently utilizing LLMs alongside human expertise, healthcare organizations can improve patient care and outcomes. Implementation should be approached with caution and consideration to ensure the safe and effective use of LLMs in the clinical setting.",
