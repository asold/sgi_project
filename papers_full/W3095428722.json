    "abstract": "Abstract The paper presents experimental diagnostics of the oil-paper insulating system of power transformers using progressive frequency method. The first part of the paper deals with the basic information about diagnostics of power oil transformers. The second part of the paper deals with the use of frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) for power oil transformers. This method is used in the analysis of insulating condition of power transformer with the system of oil-paper. It was found that the results of these tests are highly influenced by the operating temperature during the experimental measurement. Moisture and conductivity between the insulating transformer paper and oil in an insulating system are highly dependent on the temperature. In the other part, the paper presents experimental results of the diagnostic measurement for a real traction oil transformer at different operating temperatures and states (with oil and without). Finally, the paper presents comparative measurement among several autotransformers with the same power. In experimental measurements, the correlation between the measured values and the operational aspects of the individual oil autotransformers are shown.",
