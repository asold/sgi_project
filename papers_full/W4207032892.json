  "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The Oriatron eRT6 is a linear accelerator (linac) used in FLASH preclinical studies able to reach dose rates ranging from conventional (CONV) up to ultrahigh (UHDR). This work describes the implementation of commercially available beam current transformers (BCTs) as online monitoring tools compatible with CONV and UHDR irradiations for preclinical FLASH studies. Methods Two BCTs were used to measure the output of the Oriatron eRT6 linac. First, the correspondence between the set nominal beam parameters and those measured by the BCTs was checked. Then, we established the relationship between the total exit charge (measured by BCTs) and the absorbed dose to water. The influence of the pulse width (PW) and the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) at UHDR was characterized, as well as the short‐ and long‐term stabilities of the relationship between the exit charge and the dose at CONV and UHDR. Results The BCTs were able to determine consistently the number of pulses, PW, and PRF. For fixed PW and pulse height, the exit charge measured from BCTs was correlated with the dose, and linear relationships were found with uncertainties of 0.5 % and 3 % in CONV and UHDR mode, respectively. Short‐ and long‐term stabilities of the dose‐to‐charge ratio were below 1.6 %. Conclusions We implemented commercially available BCTs and demonstrated their ability to act as online beam monitoring systems to support FLASH preclinical studies with CONV and UHDR irradiations. The implemented BCTs support dosimetric measurements, highlight variations among multiple measurements in a row, enable monitoring of the physics parameters used for irradiation, and are an important step for the safety of the clinical translation of FLASH radiation therapy.",
