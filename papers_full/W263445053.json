  "abstract": "Distribution Transformers are one of the imperative equipment in power system.The insulation design has an important role because it continuously energizes in a day.Due to electro mechanical stresses the operating temperature of distribution transformer will be increased which maintains with in limit using liquid dielectrics.Traditional mineral oil is used as liquid dielectrics in Distribution Transformer.Due to lack of fossil fuels and lesser biodegradability characteristics of mineral oil, the alternating liquid dielectrics are important.In this research work viscosity of pongamia pinnata oil is measured using PLINT TE 62 Bench Viscometer as per ASTM D445 standard .Water content analysis of the oil sample has to be measured by weight balance method and Breakdown strength of oil sample was measured by Nutronics oil test set as per IEC 60156.From the experimental analysis, the viscosity of pongamia pinnata oil is low as compared to RBDPO, Soyabean oil, Coconut oil and Sunflower oil.The moisture content of pongamia pinnata oil is significantly reduced during aging period and the average breakdown strength of pongamia pinnata oil is higher than that of conventionally used mineral oil.",
