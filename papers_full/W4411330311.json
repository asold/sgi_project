By integrating mathematical \nmodeling, computational simulations, and systems biology, \nit serves as an integrative knowledge framework, especially \nfor complex diseases. QSP provides mathematical models \nof biological systems that can be used to generate hypoth -\neses, identify critical system parameters, and simulate sce -\nnarios that are otherwise difficult to test. This approach \nenables a mechanistic understanding of complex biological \nprocesses and drug interactions [ 4], allowing researchers \nto optimize drug dosing regimens and assess drug efficacy \nand safety earlier in development. QSP offers several key \nbenefits: improved decision-making by helping to identify \noptimal drug targets, more efficient clinical trial designs, \nand risk reduction of clinical failures by simulating various \nscenarios before real-world testing. QSP also has the poten-\ntial to provide personalized medicine by modeling patient \nvariability, enabling the tailoring of therapies to specific \npatient subgroups, enhancing treatment effectiveness, and \nminimizing adverse effects.\nThe promise of QSP lies in its ability to provide a robust \nframework for integrating data from preclinical and clinical \nstudies, improving drug development efficiency, enhancing \npatient outcomes, and paving the way for innovative, safer, \nand more effective treatments [ 5–9]. Its potential to reduce \ndevelopment costs and timelines while increasing the prob-\nability of success makes it a cornerstone of modern drug \ndevelopment strategies. The framework’s versatility gives \nrise to models of varying complexity spanning the spectrum \nfrom detailed ODE representations [ 10] to complex com -\nputational methodologies [ 11]. QSP empowers research -\ners to explore various data modalities and computational \napproaches. This flexibility has led to the realization that \nbuilding a QSP model, unlike a more typical pharmacomet-\nrics model, requires that scientists focus extensively on key \nsteps of model development [ 7]. These, broadly, include: \n(1) defining appropriate needs statements; (2) reviewing \nrelevant biological, physiological, and clinical data; (3) \nidentifying appropriate representations of biological, physi-\nological, and clinical knowledge; (4) determining appropri-\nate methodologies for capturing expected behaviors and \nsystematically assessing the model predictions; and finally, \n(5) appropriately use the model, and the associated analy -\nses, to generate testable hypotheses.\nThe growing number of QSP-informed submissions \nto regulatory agencies highlights its increasing influence, \ndemonstrating credibility in guiding dose selection, dos -\ning regimens, and risk mitigation strategies [ 12]. By pre -\ndicting potential risks and outcomes early, QSP ensures \ncost and time efficiency by reducing the need for costly \nand time-consuming trial-and-error experiments, thereby \naccelerating the development timeline. Furthermore, QSP’s \nversatility allows it to address challenges across diverse \ntherapeutic areas, including hematology, oncology, rare dis-\neases, and pediatric drug development. As highlighted in a \nrecent report, QSP has emerged as an increasingly valuable \ntool in drug development, evidenced by the growing num -\nber of submissions to the U.S. FDA over the past decade \n[13]. Its applications include dose selection, optimization of \ndosing regimens, and providing insights for clinical trials, \nparticularly for rare diseases [14], focusing on drug efficacy \nand safety. QSP submissions highlight its versatile use cases \nwhile supporting the design and optimization of clinical tri-\nals for adult and pediatric populations.\nIn developing a QSP model, the choices made regard -\ning the nature of the mathematical (or computational) model \nare critical. Given the uncertainty that often surrounds the \ndevelopment of mechanistic QSP models, it is therefore \nimportant to appreciate that in QSP, not only are the model \npredictions a key deliverable, but also the model itself, \nincluding the process of developing the model. Since the \nearly days of QSP model development, primary emphasis \nhas been placed on critical methodological aspects, focusing \non model structure, parameter quantification, and assess -\nment [ 15, 16]. It should come as no surprise that recent \ndevelopments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine \nlearning (ML) were quickly recognized as major opportuni-\nties for further advancing QSP [17, 18].\nIn this paper, we wish to explore how AI/ML might \nreshape the mathematical/computational model develop -\nment process in QSP. In doing so, we will explore the abil -\nity of AI/ML to assist in four primary tasks: (1) extracting \ninformation, (2) developing surrogate models, (3) translat -\ning data into models, and (4) developing hybrid mechanis -\ntic/ML models. Finally, we will address whether AI/ML will \neventually transition from a tool to a partner, Fig. 1. In doing \nso, we will not provide any further definitions of QSP or AI/\nML and will only state that “[…] AI is the broader concept \nof enabling a machine or system to sense , reason, act, or \nadapt like a human; ML is an application of AI that allows \nmachines to extract knowledge from data and learn from it \nautonomously1.”\n1  h t t p  s : /  / c l o  u d  . g o  o g l e  . c o  m / l  e a r  n / a  r t i fi   c  i a l  - i n t  e l l  i g e  n c e  - v s  - m a c  h i  n e - l e \na r n i n g.\n1 3\n36 Page 2 of 14\nJournal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (2025) 52:36\nUsing ML to extract and represent \ninformation during the model development \nprocess\nExtracting and representing relevant information is foun -\ndational in developing mathematical models, ensuring \naccuracy, reliability, and utility [19]. This process involves \nidentifying and organizing key data, ensuring traceability \nthroughout the data lifecycle, translating it into mathemati -\ncal or computational structures that reflect the biological, \nchemical, or physical systems under investigation, and \ndefining the model’s scope and objectives. Effective extrac-\ntion clarifies the questions the model seeks to answer, avoids \nunnecessary complexity, and ensures essential components \nare included. Researchers can design scientifically robust \nframeworks tailored to specific study needs by grounding \nthe model in comprehensive and well-curated information. \nAn efficient extraction process leverages existing experi -\nmental findings, prior models, and validated knowledge, \nreducing redundancy while saving time and resources. It \nalso provides a structured basis for parameter estimation, \ncalibration, and validation, ensuring that observed data, \nrather than hypothetical assumptions, guide the model. \nKnowledge gaps often become evident during this process, \nhighlighting areas for additional experiments or analyses to \nimprove the model’s completeness and accuracy.\nOrganizing information in a transparent and reproduc -\nible format fosters collaboration among interdisciplinary \nteams, allowing diverse expertise to contribute to model \ndevelopment. This transparency also helps ensure regula -\ntory compliance by justifying model assumptions and data \nsources required by regulatory authorities, such as the US \nFDA or the European Medicine Agency (EMA). Addition -\nally, well-represented information ensures model flexibility \nand scalability, enabling the integration of patient variability \nto support personalized medicine or refine dosing regimens \nfor complex diseases. Ultimately, this step aligns the model \nwith real-world systems, facilitates collaboration, and \nenables regulatory acceptance, forming the cornerstone of \neffective model development. PKPD parameters define drug \nabsorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and target \ninteractions and serve as the backbone for simulating drug \nbehavior and its effects within biological systems. Extract -\ning PKPD values from literature ensures the model is built \non validated, experimentally derived data, enhancing cred -\nibility and reducing the need for redundant studies. Accurate \nvalues are indispensable for predicting drug efficacy and \nsafety across diverse scenarios, enabling the development \nof robust and reliable models.\nLiterature mining is essential to this endeavor, system -\natically gathering and synthesizing knowledge from vast \namounts of published data [ 20]. This step ensures models \nFig. 1 Integration of machine \nlearning and quantitative systems \npharmacology: leveraging infor-\nmation extraction, hybrid mecha-\nnistic/ML models, surrogate \nmodels, and data translation to \nenhance model development and \nenable digital twin applications\n \n1 3\nPage 3 of 14 36\nJournal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (2025) 52:36\nliterature to making predictions that can be used as founda-\ntional steps for further model development.\nUsing ML to translate data to dynamic \nmodels\nKnowing the components and their interactions is essen -\ntial for developing mechanistic QSP models, as they pro -\nvide the foundational framework for the model’s structure. \nComponents represent biological entities, such as proteins, \ngenes, cells, or tissues. At the same time, interactions cap -\nture the dynamic relationships between these entities, such \nas biochemical reactions, signaling pathways, and phar -\nmacological or physiological processes. A comprehensive \nunderstanding of these aspects ensures that the model better \nreflects the underlying biology of the system, as QSP mod -\nels focus on integrating mechanistic details across multiple \nbiological scales to simulate how a drug affects a system \nand how the system responds.\nSystem structure in QSP models is typically developed \nbased on prior knowledge derived from established lit -\nerature, experimental data, and expert insights [ 9]. This \nprocess involves explicitly identifying and validating the \ncomponents and interactions within the biological system \nto ensure that the model captures the known mechanisms \naccurately. Researchers may rely on subject matter experts \nand curated databases of protein-protein interactions, sig -\nnaling pathways, or pharmacokinetic and pharmacody -\nnamic relationships to outline the framework of the system. \nHowever, while this approach ensures that the model aligns \nwith established scientific understanding, it is often limited \nby the availability and scope of existing knowledge, which \nmay overlook novel or context-specific interactions. Real -\nizations based on manual curation tend to reflect small-scale \ncausal relationships.\nMachine learning complements this traditional pro -\ncess by enabling the interpretation of large-scale, complex \ndatasets to uncover previously unrecognized components \nand interactions. It proves particularly useful in cases with \nmultiple variables with very few observations vs. a clini -\ncal dataset with few and many observations. Unlike manual \ncuration, ML can identify patterns, correlations, and depen-\ndencies within high-dimensional data, offering a data-driven \nperspective that can augment and refine the system struc -\nture. For instance, ML techniques such as network infer -\nence [30] can predict regulatory or signaling relationships \nbased on gene expression or proteomics data. At the same \ntime, clustering algorithms can reveal emergent substruc -\ntures or functional modules. By integrating these insights \nwith prior knowledge, researchers can expand and adapt \nthe QSP model’s framework to reflect established and novel \nare grounded in validated findings and incorporate relevant \nbiological, chemical, and pharmacological insights. AI and \nML advances have significantly enhanced literature mining \nby automating data identification, extraction, and catego -\nrization from diverse sources [ 21]. AI/ML tools efficiently \nanalyze complex datasets, detect patterns, and prioritize \nrelevant content, uncovering connections often overlooked \nby manual methods. These capabilities accelerate the pro -\ncess and improve the accuracy and depth of extracted \nknowledge. The ability of AI/ML to process and integrate \nlarge-scale data has transformed literature mining into an \nindispensable component of model development, providing \na robust foundation for predictive modeling in fields like \nQSP. However, a notable concern is that the quality of data \nmining can vary significantly depending on the topic, poten-\ntially impacting the reproducibility and reliability of results, \nespecially in complex fields like biomedical research [22].\nEarly efforts [ 23] demonstrated the feasibility of lit -\nerature mining for retrieving PK numerical data. Such \napproaches addressed the difficulties associated with the \nmanual curation of thousands of literature entries. Alter -\nnatively, literature mining “trains” a system to discover \nhelpful information or make reasonable hypotheses based \non available publications. Early efforts focused on entity \nrecognition, information extraction, and outlier detection. \nLater approaches recognized the need to develop additional \nstandards, i.e., ontologies, for proper annotation and effec -\ntive searching [ 24]. Most recent efforts have been to cre -\nate comprehensive ML pipelines by developing appropriate \nannotations that maximize the classification capabilities of \nthe search tools [ 25]. Such approaches offer the possibility \nof effectively mining hundreds of thousands of documents. \nLeveraging advances in natural language processing (NLP) \n[26] demonstrated a workflow showcasing the expedited \nextraction and analysis of large amounts of information \nfrom regulatory review documents.\nRecent approaches further illustrate how applying ML \nand mechanistic modeling can accomplish preclinical \nexposure prediction [27]. ML learning establishes relations \nbetween molecular structures and PK parameters, which are \nthen used as input to a secondary ML layer that predicts \nexposure. In [28], it was shown how ML could learn struc -\nture-activity relationships, which were used to predict PK of \nuntested compounds. A similar approach was also proposed \nby [29], showing how ML tools obtain time-dependent PK \nand ADME parameters, which are then used to develop pre-\ndictive models incorporated into more complex mechanistic \nmodels.\nIn short, ML has the potential to enable QSP scientists to \nstreamline the literature landscape and provide a compre -\nhensive framework for systematizing predictions. In other \nwords, in one shot, one can now go from surveying the \n1 3\n36 Page 4 of 14\nJournal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (2025) 52:36\nCombining QSP , surrogate models, and ML \nto build digital twins\nSurrogate modeling and digital twins are closely related \nconcepts that often complement each other, particularly \nin complex systems modeling and simulation [ 39]. A sur-\nrogate model is a simplified mathematical or computa -\ntional representation of a more complex system designed \nto approximate its behavior while significantly reducing the \ncomputational cost. These models are typically derived from \ndata generated by high-fidelity simulations or experiments. \nThey are used to accelerate analyses, optimize designs, or \nexplore otherwise computationally prohibitive scenarios. \nIn contrast, a digital twin is a dynamic, virtual representa -\ntion of a physical system or process that evolves, integrating \nreal-time data to provide insights, monitor performance, and \npredict outcomes. The relationship between these two lies \nin their synergistic roles within a modeling ecosystem. Sur-\nrogate models are often embedded within digital twins to \nenhance their efficiency, enabling the twin to perform real-\ntime predictions or iterative simulations without relying on \nthe full computational complexity of the original system. \nRelated to surrogate models are virtual populations con -\nsisting of a simulated representation of a group of subjects, \nmimicking a real-world population’s characteristics, behav-\niors, or interactions. In quantitative systems pharmacology \n(QSP) and drug development, virtual populations are used \nto simulate diverse patient responses, enabling the predic -\ntion of drug efficacy, safety, and optimal dosing in different \nsubpopulations [40–42].\nA digital twin of a drug development pipeline might use \nsurrogate models to quickly simulate pharmacokinetic and \npharmacodynamic (PKPD) outcomes across a range of dos-\ning strategies [ 43–46]. This integration allows the digital \ntwin to remain adaptive and responsive to new data while \nretaining the predictive power of the underlying high-fidelity \nmodels. Moreover, the data streams and insights generated \nby digital twins can inform the development of surrogate \nmodels. As digital twins continually ingest real-time data \nand refine their predictions, they can provide updated or \nenriched datasets that enhance the accuracy and relevance \nof the surrogate models. This feedback loop creates a robust \nframework where surrogate models and digital twins itera -\ntively improve each other, enabling more robust decision-\nmaking, optimization, and scenario analysis. In essence, \nsurrogate models provide the computational efficiency for \ndigital twins to operate in real-time or near-real-time set -\ntings. In contrast, digital twins offer a dynamic and data-\ndriven environment for deploying and refining surrogate \nmodels. Together, they form a complementary relationship \nthat enables the simulation, monitoring, and optimization of \ncomplex systems in practical and innovative ways.\nbiological mechanisms, increasing its accuracy and predic -\ntive power. This dynamic interplay between expert-driven \nand data-driven approaches ensures that QSP models remain \nrobust and relevant in capturing the complexity of biologi -\ncal systems and their responses to therapeutic interventions. \nBroadly, one can identify two likely areas where ML plays a \nsignificant role, depending on how data is treated and incor-\nporated: network inference and direct translation of data \ninto models.\nNetwork inference has been a foundational concept in \nsystems biology [31]. It refers to the computational process \nof reconstructing interaction networks from biological data \nto understand the relationships between various compo -\nnents, such as genes, proteins, or metabolites. By analyz -\ning high-dimensional datasets, such as transcriptomics or \nproteomics, network inference algorithms identify depen -\ndencies, correlations, or causal interactions representing \nbiological processes like signaling pathways, regulatory \nnetworks, or metabolic systems. Machine learning has sig -\nnificantly developed such approaches [ 32]. As illustrated \nnicely by [ 33], ML can assist in providing, using omics \ndatasets, predictions of new interactions between genes and \nproteins that can be integrated within prior QSP mechanistic \nmodels. Such pipelines offer an excellent starting point for \nmerging extensive databases with large-scale mechanistic \nmodels.\nSecondly, recent approaches examined the possibility \nof converting data hypothesis-neutral into dynamic QSP \nmodels. Researchers in [ 34] present a systematic pipeline \nfor converting biological data into dynamic QSP mod -\nels through Boolean network inference [ 35]. The process \nbegins with data collection and binarization, where continu-\nous data are converted into binary states using methods like \nk-means clustering. These binary states represent biological \nspecies’ “on” and “off” activity levels. A Boolean network is \nthen constructed by inferring logical relationships between \ncomponents, employing techniques such as the Best-Fit \nExtension method. The resulting Boolean network pro -\nvides a qualitative representation of system interactions and \ncan undergo pruning and sensitivity analysis to refine and \nsimplify its structure. Subsequently, the Boolean network \nis transformed into a dynamic model using ordinary dif -\nferential equations (ODEs), leveraging homologs of Bool -\nean functions to approximate continuous behaviors [ 36]. \nA similar approach was also demonstrated in [ 37] using a \ngeneralized model approximation [38]. Converting data into \nmodels is quite powerful as it shows that the essential ele -\nments of a QSP building process can, in principle, be auto -\nmated, provided that appropriate data exists.\n1 3\nPage 5 of 14 36\nJournal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (2025) 52:36\ngreater adaptability in dynamic or poorly understood sys -\ntems. This will enable us to effectively represent and extract \ninsights from system components that defy mechanistic \nexplanation but exhibit quantifiable patterns within data, \nallowing a more complete and accurate representation of \nthe overall system. This approach provides a pragmatic way \nto build predictive and insightful models, even when faced \nwith knowledge gaps, by using data to inform and enhance \nour understanding where explicit mechanisms are unknown. \nTherefore, the development of hybrid mechanistic/ML mod-\nels has been driven by the need to address the limitations \nof purely mechanistic or purely data-driven approaches in \nunderstanding and predicting the behavior of complex bio -\nlogical systems [53]. This integration can be performed by \nusing physics-informed machine learning or a hybrid mod -\neling approach:\nPhysics-informed machine learning (PIML)\nIn this approach, mechanistic insights are explicitly incorpo-\nrated into the ML algorithms to guide or constrain the learn-\ning process [54]. The integration might include embedding \nknown equations, boundary conditions, or conservation laws \ninto the ML model architecture or the loss function. This \nmethod ensures that the ML model adheres to the physical \nor mechanistic constraints of the system, improving gener -\nalization and interpretability while reducing the reliance on \nlarge datasets. The work in [ 55] demonstrated the potential \nof a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and frac -\ntional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (fPINNs), inte -\ngrating ODEs with integer/fractional derivative order from \ncompartmental modeling with neural networks to improve \nprediction of complex drug responses. A PINN in a QSP \ncontext is a hybrid modeling framework that combines the \ninterpretability of mechanistic models with the flexibility \nof machine learning. In this approach, the neural network \nlearns to approximate system behavior, such as drug con -\ncentration-time profiles or therapeutic effects, while being \nconstrained by the underlying mathematical principles gov-\nerning the system, such as ODEs or partial differential equa-\ntions describing absorption, distribution, metabolism, and \nexcretion (ADME) or drug-target interactions. The PINN \nleverages observed data and embedded physics to esti -\nmate key pharmacological parameters and predict system \ndynamics simultaneously. The physics-informed loss func -\ntion ensures that the network’s predictions adhere to known \nbiological and physiological laws, improving robustness \nand generalizability even with sparse or incomplete datas -\nets. This enables PINNs to capture the complexity of QSP \nsystems, infer latent dynamics, and provide biologically \ninterpretable insights, bridging the gap between traditional \nmechanistic models and data-driven approaches.\nMachine learning plays a pivotal role in enabling the \ndevelopment of digital twins in quantitative systems phar -\nmacology by integrating patient-specific data with mecha -\nnistic models to create highly personalized simulations of \ndrug behavior and therapeutic outcomes [ 47]. QSP models \ncan generate high-fidelity, simulation-based datasets that \ncapture various physiological and pharmacological scenar -\nios, including edge cases or rare conditions. These datasets \ncan be used to train ML-based surrogates, which mimic the \nbehavior of the full QSP model while being computation -\nally efficient. By learning from both real-time and historical \npatient data, as well as QSP-simulated data, ML enhances \nthe ability of digital twins to dynamically adapt and predict \nresponses to different dosing regimens or therapeutic inter -\nventions. This synergy between ML and QSP supports the \ncreation of robust digital twins and facilitates the modeling \nof patient variability, optimization of treatment strategies, \nand advancements in personalized medicine [40, 48, 49].\nHybrid ML-mechanistic models\nWhile firmly rooted in established scientific principles, \nmechanistic models often face scalability, parameteriza -\ntion, and uncertainty quantification challenges, mainly \nwhen incomplete system knowledge or datasets are large \nand complex [ 50, 51]. Conversely, machine learning mod -\nels are adept at identifying patterns and making predictions \nfrom vast datasets but often lack interpretability, biologi -\ncal plausibility, and the ability to generalize reliably beyond \nthe training data. The integration of these approaches has \nemerged to bridge these gaps, enabling the construction \nof models that are both more interpretable and capable of \nleveraging data-driven insights to uncover novel relation -\nships, refine parameter estimates, and make robust predic -\ntions. This need became especially acute in systems biology \nand pharmacology, where dynamic interactions across \nmultiple scales and heterogeneous data sources are com -\nmon. Yet, comprehensive mechanistic knowledge is often \nunavailable or incomplete.\nHybrid, that is, mechanistic + machine learning, models \noffer a powerful alternative for tackling complex systems \nwhere complete mechanistic understanding is elusive. By \nintegrating established mechanistic principles with data-\ndriven machine learning, these models can leverage the \nstrengths of both approaches. Specifically, they allow us \nto retain mechanistic descriptions for well-understood \nsystem parts while employing ML components to capture \nrelationships that are too complex or poorly understood to \nbe modeled mechanistically [ 52]. ML components can fill \nknowledge gaps, parameterize models, or infer relationships \nnot captured by existing mechanistic theories, allowing for \n1 3\n36 Page 6 of 14\nJournal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (2025) 52:36\nLarge Language models: transitioning AI/ML \nfrom “tool” to “partner”\nIt has become evident that ML plays a central role in QSP, \noffering a unique opportunity to incorporate advances in \ndata science to boost its impact [ 60]. As our discussion \nhas indicated, AI/ML is treated as a sophisticated toolbox \nthat assists in computationally intensive tasks and supports \nexisting methodologies that have withstood the test of time \n[61]. Treating AI/ML as a toolbox must be held to standards \nat least as high as those of conventional model assessment. \nHowever, studies have highlighted the need for caution, sug-\ngesting that AI/ML should not be unquestioningly trusted \nwithout critical evaluation [62]. This is a valid criticism, and \ncareful assessment processes must be implemented before \nturning away all AI/ML tools.\nIn contrast to the traditional use of ML solely as a tool, the \nemergence of ChatGPT 2 ( https://openai.com) has marked \na pivotal moment, dramatically shifting the landscape of \nAI/ML by introducing broadly Large Language Models \n(LLMs) as transformative tools. LLMs are advanced AI sys-\ntems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and \ngenerate human-like language [ 63]. They use deep learn -\ning architectures to process and analyze text, enabling them \nto perform tasks like summarizing information, answering \nquestions, writing code, and translating languages. LLMs \nare designed for conversational interactions, offering users \ncoherent, context-aware responses. They have already been \nwidely used in various fields, including education, health -\ncare, and research, for their ability to simplify complex \nconcepts, assist with problem-solving, and enhance produc-\ntivity through natural language understanding and genera -\ntion [64].\nVarious large language models (LLMs) are currently \navailable, each offering unique capabilities suited to differ -\nent applications. OpenAI’s ChatGPT  (   h t t p s : / / c h a t g p t . c o m     \n) , powered by the GPT-4 architecture, is widely used for \nconversational AI, coding assistance, and creative content \ngeneration. Google DeepMind’s Gemini  (   h t t p s : / / g e m i n i . \ng o o g l e . c o m / a p p     ) integrates advanced reasoning capabili -\nties with language understanding, reflecting Google’s latest \nefforts in general-purpose AI. Anthropic’s Claude  (   h t t p s : / / c l \na u d e . a i / n e w     ) emphasizes safety and constitutional AI, mak-\ning it suitable for aligned and controllable deployment in \nsensitive contexts. Meta’s LLaMA (Large Language Model \nMeta AI) is designed primarily for academic research, offer-\ning open-access models to support foundational exploration \n2 ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) referring to an \nadvanced conversational (i.e., chat) AI system built on the GPT archi-\ntecture, which leverages extensive pre-training on vast textual data to \ngenerate coherent, context-aware, and human-like responses tailored \nfor interactive dialogues.\nComposite models combining mechanistic and ML \nmodels\nDifferent parts of the problem are modeled using distinct \ntechniques based on their characteristics or data availabil -\nity. For example, components of the system that are well-\nunderstood and governed by first principles are modeled \nmechanistically. In contrast, poorly understood or data-rich \nelements are modeled using ML [ 52]. Mechanistic mod -\nels rely on well-defined, directly measurable, expert vari -\nables such as enzyme concentrations, receptor occupancy, \nor drug pharmacokinetics. Grounded in first principles and \nexperimental evidence, these variables provide interpreta -\nble insights into fundamental biological processes and are \ntypically derived from controlled laboratory experiments. \nHowever, many of these variables become unobservable \nor impractical to measure in clinical settings. For instance, \nwhile a laboratory might precisely track drug-receptor bind-\ning affinity, clinical measurements often focus on aggregate \noutcomes like efficacy or biomarkers. This limitation poses \nchallenges for purely mechanistic models, which struggle \nto capture real-world variability and systemic interactions. \nBy contrast, ML models thrive on observable variables \nlike blood pressure, genetic profiles, or patient demograph -\nics, which are directly measured in clinical settings. How -\never, their lack of biological interpretability often results \nin black-box predictions. Hybrid models combine these \nstrengths, using mechanistic components to model biologi -\ncally defined variables and anchor the system in established \nknowledge.\nIn contrast, ML components handle data-rich, complex, \nor less mechanistically understood variables, such as clini -\ncal scores, patient variability, or biomarker interactions. \nThe mechanistic model might describe pharmacokinetics \nin a hybrid approach, while ML predicts patient-specific \noutcomes based on mechanistic variables and additional \ndemographic or genomic factors. This division of labor bal-\nances interpretability with flexibility, ensuring hybrid mod-\nels remain grounded in evidence while scaling to diverse \nreal-world data. The progression from mechanistic models \nto ML models and, ultimately, hybrid models highlight the \ncomplementary nature of these approaches, particularly \nwhen it comes to the types of variables each method can \neffectively model [56, 57]. In [58], for example, it was dem-\nonstrated how a hybrid, mechanistic + neural network model \ncould be built so that a neural network absorption model is \nalso learned while estimating the mechanistic model param-\neters. Meanwhile, in [ 59], a hybrid model that can enable \npersonalized survival prediction was demonstrated.\n1 3\nPage 7 of 14 36\nJournal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (2025) 52:36\nPolicyGPT [66], designed to analyze and draft policy docu-\nments with precision.\nAs LLMs become increasingly integrated into complex \ntasks, the need for efficient and precise prompts has become \nessential, giving rise to the discipline of prompt engineering \n[67]. A prompt refers to the input or instruction provided \nto an LLM to elicit a desired response, making its design \ncrucial for achieving accurate and context-relevant outputs. \nThis emerging field focuses on crafting effective prompts to \noptimize the performance of LLMs. By designing precise, \ncontext-aware instructions, prompt engineering enables \nusers to harness LLM capabilities for specific tasks, includ-\ning computational and mathematical modeling. In these \ndomains, well-constructed prompts can guide LLMs to gen-\nerate accurate code for numerical solvers, translate biologi-\ncal or physical systems into mathematical representations, \nand debug or refine existing models. This practice bridges \nthe gap between human expertise and AI capabilities, ensur-\ning that LLM outputs align with domain-specific require -\nments. As such, prompt engineering is pivotal in leveraging \nLLMs as collaborative tools, enhancing their utility in solv-\ning complex modeling problems efficiently and accurately.\nPrompt engineering is a relatively new field within arti -\nficial intelligence that focuses on crafting the most effective \ninput prompts to guide LLMs, producing the best possible \noutputs for specific tasks, essentially acting as a way to \noptimize how you communicate with AI systems to get the \ndesired results; it is considered a critical skill as the capabili-\nties of these models continue to develop. A prompt engineer \nmust understand how LLMs work and natural language pro-\ncessing (NLP) techniques and craft well-structured prompts \nthat effectively convey the desired task and context. With \nthe increasing adoption of LLMs, prompt engineering is \nbecoming recognized, demanding expertise in prompt \ndesign and optimization3.\nScientists are already exploring the possibilities of con -\nversing with an LLM to obtain parameters from the literature \nand generate computer code implementing pharmacomet -\nrics models of interest [68, 69]. The impact of prompt strat-\negies to generate code, perform calculations, and generate \nscientific text in a PK context was further examined in [70], \nwhereas the ability of two LLMs to generate relevant NON-\nMEM code was assessed in [71]. Most recently, researchers \nhave begun exploring the provocative idea of using LLMs \nnot just as information retrieval tools, but as neutral media-\ntors in scientific debates, including those surrounding the \nevolving role of AI/ML in Quantitative Systems Pharma -\ncology (QSP). In this context, LLMs were tested for their \nability to distill opposing viewpoints, identify points of con-\nvergence, and propose balanced frameworks, highlighting \n3  h t t p s :   /  / w w  w . m  c k i  n s e   y . c   o m  / f e  a t u r   e d -  i n  s i g   h t s  / m c k  i n   s e y  - e x  p l a i   n e  r s /   \nw h   a t - i  s -  p  r o m p t - e n g i n e e r i n g.\nin language modeling.

Their transparent release \nstrategy and multilingual training corpus make them valu -\nable tools for research and developer applications.Together, \nthese LLMs span the spectrum from open research to com -\nmercial deployment, providing a robust toolkit for advanc -\ning AI across disciplines. Beyond the dominant offerings \nfrom OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, a rapidly \nexpanding ecosystem of regional and open-source LLMs \nis reshaping the AI landscape. Models like Baidu’s Ernie \nBot, Naver’s HyperCLOV A X, Mistral’s efficient open \nmodels, and India’s OpenHathi underscore a global shift \ntoward sovereign and multilingual AI development. Mean -\nwhile, specialized models such as Code Llama, Command \nR+, and WizardLM demonstrate the growing demand for \ntailored solutions in coding, retrieval-augmented genera -\ntion, and instruction tuning. As this diversification acceler -\nates, it promises to democratize AI access, foster innovation \nthrough competition, and challenge the hegemony of a few \ncentralized players—setting the stage for a more dynamic \nand inclusive future for LLMs.\nEven more exciting is that several platforms that leverage \nLLMs for specialized niche areas have emerged.

The seamless integration \nof ML with mechanistic models could become a founda -\ntional aspect of QSP, and LLMs will play a pivotal role here. \nThey could assist in designing hybrid frameworks that com-\nbine mechanistic principles with data-driven components, \nsuch as neural networks while automating hyperparameter \ntuning and validation. This synergy between approaches \nenhances the scalability of QSP efforts, enabling collabora-\ntive work among interdisciplinary teams. LLMs serve as \na shared interface, aligning objectives and assisting with \nhigh-performance computing, cloud integration, and model \ndeployment.\nLLMs will empower quantitatively trained profession -\nals, such as mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and data \nscientists, to engage with life scientists and clinicians. By \nproviding real-time explanations of biological concepts, \ndecoding specialized terminology, and offering contextual \ninsights, LLMs reduce the steep learning curve often asso -\nciated with transitioning into life sciences. They facilitate \ncross-disciplinary communication, enabling experts in \nmathematical modeling to translate their work into bio -\nlogically meaningful terms and fostering collaboration \nwith pharmacologists and biologists. Interactive learning \npathways supported by LLMs accelerate onboarding, sug -\ngesting resources, generating example problems, and auto -\nmating code generation for biological simulations. LLMs \nalso streamline the development of mathematical models in \nbiology and pharmacology by assisting in parameter iden -\ntification, translating biological systems into mathematical \nframeworks, and enabling multiscale integration. They sim-\nplify literature review and insight extraction, summarizing \npapers, extracting experimental findings, and synthesizing \nraw data into actionable insights. This capability promotes \ninnovation by allowing researchers to safely explore bio -\nlogical questions, propose novel hypotheses, and rapidly \ndevelop computational prototype models.\nIn summary, LLMs will drive the evolution of machine \nlearning from a tool whose use requires a significant level of \nexpertise to an active partner in mathematical and compu -\ntational modeling in QSP. By integrating natural language \nunderstanding with advanced computational capabilities, \nLLMs assist researchers in automating data extraction, code \ngeneration, and parameter optimization, facilitating inter -\ndisciplinary collaboration and hypothesis generation. Their \nability to contextualize biological and mathematical knowl-\nedge enables seamless translation between data, models, and \nreal-world applications. LLMs will reshape QSP by reduc -\ning barriers, enhancing collaboration, and enabling faster, \nmore accessible model development. They bridge the gap \nbetween quantitative and biological domains, democratiz -\ning access to pharmacology and biology for quantitatively \ntrained professionals while providing biological scientists \ntheir potential to arbitrate complex methodological ten -\nsions, such as how AI/ML should complement mechanistic \nmodeling in QSP [72]. The critical thing to remember is that \nin these applications, the interactions with the LLMs were \nmade using generic (agnostic) approaches and language \nusing lay terms. Thus, the pivotal change is that the user \ndoes not need to be a domain “expert”! One can identify \nmany issues associated with accuracy and correctness, but \nwe must also realize that we only witness the early begin -\nnings of an upcoming revolution.\nSo, what’s next\nThe arrival of large language models has the potential to sig-\nnificantly transform the landscape of computational mod -\neling, with profound implications across disciplines [ 73]. \nQSP will not be an exception. LLMs bridge knowledge \ngaps, enhance collaboration, and democratize the creation \nand consumption of scientific knowledge [ 74]. By acting \nas intelligent assistants, LLMs enable researchers without \ndeep coding or domain expertise to engage with advanced \nmodeling workflows. They assist in generating code for \nnumerical solvers, translating biological problems into \nmathematical representations, and debugging or optimizing \ncomplex pipelines. This reduces barriers to entry, allowing a \nbroader range of individuals to contribute to QSP advance -\nments. Early comparisons already indicate that LLMs have \nthe potential to serve as reliable programming assistants \n[75, 76].\nOne of the most impactful contributions of LLMs will \nbe their ability to accelerate hypothesis testing by facilitat -\ning rapid iteration cycles in model development, suggesting \nmathematical frameworks, and generating scripts for simu -\nlating complex systems. In parallel, LLMs enable the con -\ntextual integration of biological knowledge, synthesizing \ninsights from literature, automating parameter extraction, \nand bridging disparate datasets to inform model structures \nand assumptions. This is particularly valuable in QSP, where \nmultiscale modeling combines molecular, cellular, and sys-\ntemic dynamics. LLMs could streamline this integration by \ntranslating models between domains and suggesting modu -\nlar frameworks to integrate diverse biological processes. \nLLMs also enhance the handling of data, a critical aspect \nof ML-driven modeling. They automate preprocessing steps \nsuch as feature selection, outlier detection, and scaling, \nmaking it easier to manage high-dimensional datasets like \nthose from omics studies or clinical trials.\nAdditionally, they could contribute to improved model \ninterpretability by summarizing structures, assumptions, \nand results in natural language, creating clear documen -\ntation, and translating technical outputs, such as stability \n1 3\nPage 9 of 14 36\nJournal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (2025) 52:36\n2.

LLM evaluation is already emerg-\ning as a crucial need [78], while domain-specific assessments \nare rising [79–82].
