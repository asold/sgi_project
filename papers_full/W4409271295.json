However, their accuracy and reliability in specialized fields,\nsuch as blood physiology, remain underexplored. This study evaluates the performance of six free-to-use\nLLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and Le Chat) in solving item-analyzed MCQs on blood\nphysiology. The findings aim to assess their suitability as educational aids.\nMethods\nThis cross-sectional study at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raebareli, India, involved\nadministering a 40-item MCQ test on blood physiology to 75 first-year medical students. Item analysis\nutilized the Difficulty Index (DIF I), Discrimination Index (DI), and Distractor Effectiveness (DE). Internal\nconsistency was assessed with the Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR-20) coefficient. These 40 item-analyzed MCQs\nwere presented to six selected LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Le Chat) available as\nstandalone Android applications on March 19, 2025. Three independent users accessed each LLM\nsimultaneously, uploading the compiled MCQs in a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. Accuracy was\ndetermined as the percentage of correct responses averaged across all three users. Reliability was measured\nas the percentage of MCQs consistently answered correctly by LLM to all three users. Descriptive statistics\nwere presented as mean ± standard deviation and percentages. Pearson's correlation coefficient or\nSpearman's rho was used to evaluate the associations between variables, with p < 0.05 considered\nsignificant.\nResults\nItem analysis confirmed the validity and reliability of the assessment tool, with a DIF I of 63.2 ± 20.4, a DI of\n0.38 ± 0.20, a DE of 66.7 ± 33.3, and a KR-20 of 0.804. Among LLMs, Claude 3.7 demonstrated the highest\nreliable accuracy (95%), followed by DeepSeek (93%), Grok 3 beta (93%), ChatGPT (90%), Gemini 2.0 (88%),\nand Mistral Le Chat (70%). No significant correlations were found between LLM performance and MCQ\ndifficulty, discrimination power, or distractor effectiveness.\nConclusions\nThe MCQ assessment tool exhibited an appropriate difficulty level, strong discriminatory power, and\nadequately constructed distractors. LLMs, particularly Claude, DeepSeek, and Grok, demonstrated high\naccuracy and reliability in solving blood physiology MCQs, supporting their role as supplementary\neducational tools. LLMs handled questions of varying difficulty, discrimination power, and distractor\neffectiveness with similar competence. However, given occasional errors, they should be used alongside\ntraditional teaching methods and expert supervision.\nCategories:\n Medical Education\nKeywords:\n artificial intelligence, blood physiology, chatgpt, claude, deepseek, grok, item analysis, large language\nmodels, medical education, multiple-choice questions\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming medical education. These generative artificial\nintelligence (AI) tools offer new ways to access and process information. Recent research has explored their\npotential as innovative teaching and learning aids \n[1,2]\n. However, their integration into medical education\n1\n2\n1\n \nOpen Access Original Article\nHow to cite this article\nAgarwal M, Sharma P, Wani P (April 08, 2025) Evaluating the Accuracy and Reliability of Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek,\nGemini, Grok, and Le Chat) in Answering Item-Analyzed Multiple-Choice Questions on Blood Physiology. Cureus 17(4): e81871. \nDOI\n10.7759/cureus.81871\nrequires rigorous evaluation to ensure their accuracy and reliability in delivering domain-specific\nknowledge.\nMedical physiology is the foundation of medical education, enabling students to understand the complex\nmechanisms regulating human health and disease \n[3]\n. Within this domain, blood physiology is a key module\nin the competency-based medical education (CBME) framework established by the National Medical\nCommission (NMC). This module covers essential concepts such as hemopoiesis, anemia, blood grouping,\ntransfusion reactions, hemostasis, and immune responses \n[4]\n. An in-depth understanding of these concepts\nallows first-year medical students to connect physiological principles with clinical conditions in their future\npractice.\nMultiple-choice questions (MCQs) remain a vital component of medical assessments due to their objectivity,\nscalability, and ability to evaluate higher-order thinking skills \n[5]\n. Item-analyzed MCQs ensure reliability\nand validity, ensuring accurate assessment while minimizing bias and ambiguity \n[6]\n.\nRecent studies suggest that LLMs, such as ChatGPT, can outperform medical undergraduate students in\nanswering physiology MCQs \n[7-9]\n. While promising, these findings require further exploration in specialized\nmodules such as blood physiology. LLMs can provide instant feedback, clarify complex topics, and generate\npractice questions \n[1-3,10-12]\n. However, their limitations may inadvertently misguide learners \n[1-3,10-12]\n,\nparticularly due to challenges in domain-specific accuracy \n[13,14]\n. Errors in their responses could lead to\nmisconceptions, potentially limiting their effectiveness as educational tools.\nWhile previous studies have evaluated LLMs' performance in medical physiology \n[3,8-12]\n, their reliability in\nspecialized areas such as blood physiology remains underexplored. The present study addresses this gap by\nevaluating six popular LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and Le Chat) in answering item-\nanalyzed MCQs on blood physiology.\nThis study had two main objectives: (1) to perform an item analysis on blood physiology MCQs to ensure\ntheir quality and validity and (2) to compare the accuracy and reliability of multiple LLMs in answering\nthese validated MCQs.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to systematically compare the accuracy and\nreliability of multiple LLMs using item-analyzed, curriculum-aligned blood physiology questions. The\nfindings of this study will guide educators in optimally integrating LLMs into medical education. This\nevaluation is particularly relevant for medical students and educators considering the use of LLMs as\nsupplemental learning tools. By bridging technological advancements with practical educational\napplications, our research provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of medical education.\nMaterials And Methods\nStudy setting, design, and ethical clearance\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Physiology at All India Institute of Medical\nSciences (AIIMS), Raebareli, Uttar Pradesh, India. The institutional ethics committee granted ethical\nclearance for the research.\nSelection criteria for LLMs\nLLMs were selected based on their accessibility and practicality for student use. The inclusion criteria\nrequired models to be accessible without a paid subscription, available as standalone applications for\nAndroid smartphones, capable of processing Portable Document Format (PDF) files as input, and accessible\nvia a Google account. Table \n1\n presents the six LLMs included in this study.\n \n2025 Agarwal et al. Cureus 17(4): e81871.

Perplexity AI was excluded because it primarily functions\nas a search engine that integrates multiple LLMs, preventing an independent evaluation. Meta AI was\nomitted because it lacks a standalone application and does not support PDF file input when integrated into\nWhatsApp. Microsoft Copilot access required an exclusive Microsoft account; hence, it was excluded.\nItem analysis of MCQs\nThe first author curated a set of 40 MCQs on blood physiology, incorporating both recall-based and higher-\norder cognitive questions. These validated MCQs were administered to 75 first-year Bachelor of Medicine\nand Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students at AIIMS Raebareli during an announced unit test in December\n2023. Each MCQ had four options with a single correct answer. Students were allotted 40 minutes to\ncomplete the test. Each correct response was awarded one mark, with no negative marking for incorrect\nanswers.\nStudents were ranked in descending order based on their scores. The top 27% (n = 20) were categorized as\nhigh achievers, and the bottom 27% (n = 20) were classified as low achievers \n[6]\n. Each MCQ was analyzed for\nDifficulty Index (DIF I), Discrimination Index (DI), and Distractor Effectiveness (DE). Table \n2\n outlines the\ncriteria and interpretation for each parameter.\n \n2025 Agarwal et al. Cureus 17(4): e81871.

N represents the\ntotal number of students in both groups, including those who did not respond.\nDIF I: Difficulty index; DI: Discrimination index; DE: Distractor effectiveness\nThe internal consistency reliability of the MCQ test was assessed using the Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR-20)\ncoefficient, a measure specifically designed for dichotomous data and considered a special case of\nCronbach's alpha. A KR-20 value higher than 0.8 suggests good reliability \n[6]\n.\nEvaluation of LLMs\nThe 40-item-analyzed MCQs were presented to the six selected LLMs on March 19, 2025. Three independent\nusers accessed each LLM simultaneously using Android smartphones. All LLMs were evaluated under default\nsettings in alphabetical order.\nTo ensure uniformity in testing conditions, all users uploaded a PDF containing 40 MCQs to each LLM,\nfollowed by a standardized prompt for response generation. This prompt included a contextual introduction,\na general request, instructions on how the LLM should respond, and a specified output format \n[12]\n. The exact\nprompt was as follows: \"Act as a medical college professor with expertise in Physiology. Use your knowledge\nand expertise to thoroughly analyze the provided multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and determine the\ncorrect answers. Provide the answers clearly and concisely by listing the MCQ number followed by the\ncorrect option (e.g., 1. a, 2. c). Explanations are not needed.\" We ensured that the Google account used to\naccess each LLM was free of user-side pretraining data or chats.\nThe concepts of accuracy and reliability are fundamental to the integrity of measurement and data analysis\nacross various disciplines. Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value. It\nindicates the extent to which a measurement aligns with a recognized standard or the actual value of the\nphenomenon being studied. Reliability, in contrast, refers to the consistency and repeatability of\nmeasurements under the same conditions. A reliable process produces similar results when repeated on the\nsame object or subject under comparable circumstances. The key difference lies in their focus: accuracy\nconcerns whether the measurement is correct, while reliability concerns whether the measurement remains\nconsistent across repeated trials. In scientific contexts, accuracy relates to proximity to the true value,\nwhereas reliability pertains to the consistency of results. In everyday use, the term \"reliable\" may imply both\nconsistency and accuracy, which can lead to confusion. Therefore, understanding the context is essential. In\nthis study, we have used the term reliability to encompass both accuracy and repeatability.\nAccuracy was defined as the total number of correct responses provided by an LLM across three users. Each\ncorrect response was awarded one mark, while incorrect responses received zero. The percentage accuracy\nwas calculated by dividing the average score of all three users by 40 and multiplying by 100. Reliability\nensures that results are not due to random chance and can be reproduced under the same conditions. The\nreliability percentage was calculated by dividing the number of MCQs that were answered correctly for all\nthree users by 40 and multiplying by 100.\nStatistical analysis of data\nData were recorded using Microsoft Excel 365 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Statistical analyses\n \n2025 Agarwal et al. Cureus 17(4): e81871. DOI 10.7759/cureus.81871\n4\n of \n13\nwere conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 27.0; Released 2020; IBM Corp., Armonk,\nNY). Descriptive statistics were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), median ± inter-quartile range\n(IQR), percentages, and frequencies. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for continuous data, while\nSpearman's rho was applied for categorical data to determine associations between variables, with p < 0.05\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nMCQ item analysis\nA total of 75 first-year MBBS students participated in the blood physiology MCQ test, which comprised 40\nquestions. The mean test score was 25.0 ± 6.0 (62.5 ± 14.9%), with scores ranging from 14 (35%) to 35\n(87.5%). High achievers (n = 20) scored 32.7 ± 1.5 (81.8 ± 3.7%), while low achievers (n = 20) scored 17.6 ± 1.8\n(44.0 ± 4.5%).\nItem analysis of these MCQs revealed a mean DIF of 63.2 ± 20.4, indicating an overall moderate difficulty\nlevel. The mean DI was 0.38 ± 0.20, suggesting excellent differentiation between high- and low-achieving\nstudents. The median DE was 66.7 ± 33.3, reflecting adequately constructed distractors.

Of these, 11 (27.5%) achieved ideal status (DIF I: 30-70%, DI: ≥ 0.35,\nand NFD: 0) \n[6]\n.\nCorrelation analysis revealed a weak, negative correlation between DIF I and DI (r = -0.219, p = 0.174), which\nwas statistically insignificant. A weak, negative correlation was observed between DI and DE (r = -0.297, p =\n0.063), nearing statistical significance. However, a strong, statistically significant negative correlation was\nobtained between DE and DIF I (r = -0.716, p < 0.001).\nThe KR-20 reliability coefficient for the test was 0.804. Removing any individual MCQ did not improve this\nreliability score.\nPerformance of LLMs\nTable \n4\n presents the accuracy scores, and Figure \n1\n illustrates the reliability scores of the tested LLMs. Claude\n3.7 Sonnet reliably answered 38 MCQs correctly, followed by DeepSeek (37), Grok 3 beta (37), ChatGPT (36),\nGemini 2 Flash (35), and Mistral Le Chat (28).

The findings indicate that Claude outperformed all other LLMs, with DeepSeek and Grok\nfollowing closely. ChatGPT and Gemini demonstrated slightly lower reliability and accuracy, whereas Le\nChat had the weakest performance. It is important to note that we did not apply any statistical tests to\ncompare the performance of the LLMs, as all models, except Le Chat, performed at a similar level.\nConsequently, we relied on descriptive data to identify the best-performing model.\nMCQ item analysis\nThe quality of the MCQ assessment tool was validated through item analysis, demonstrating good levels of\nDIF I, DI, DE, and reliability. In this study, 56% of the MCQs achieved an acceptable to good DIF I, which is\nlower than the 82% reported in a previous study \n[6]\n. Additionally, 78% of the MCQs exhibited an acceptable\nto excellent DI, closely aligning with the 80% reported earlier \n[6]\n. The proportion of non-functioning\ndistractors (NFDs) was 72%, comparable to the 73% found in prior research \n[6]\n. More than half of the MCQs\nmet all three quality criteria, and over a quarter reached the ideal standard, reflecting a slight improvement\nover the 20% previously reported \n[6]\n. Furthermore, the mean DIF I, DI, DE, and reliability observed in this\nstudy surpassed those documented in earlier research \n[6]\n.\nThe significant negative correlation between DE and DIF I indicates that easier questions tended to have\nfewer effective distractors. Additionally, a weak positive correlation between DI and DE, approaching\nstatistical significance, highlights the importance of well-structured distractors in differentiating among\nstudents with varying cognitive abilities. These findings align with established psychometric principles in\ntest construction \n[6,15]\n.\nLLM performance\nOur results align with recent studies demonstrating LLMs' strong performance in medical physiology\nexaminations. Subramani et al. \n[7]\n found that ChatGPT scored 85% in 20 medical physiology MCQs, while\nMondal et al. \n[8]\n reported that ChatGPT's performance surpassed the median student score. Similarly,\nSoulage et al. \n[9]\n demonstrated that ChatGPT outperformed medical students in a university physiology\nexam. However, our study extends beyond these findings in several important ways. First, we compared six\ndifferent LLMs rather than focusing on a single model. Second, we used item-analyzed MCQs that met\nspecific quality parameters. Third, we assessed both accuracy and reliability across multiple users.\nOnly Le Chat scored lower than the highest-achieving student. Claude's superior performance aligns with\nprevious findings \n[12,16,17]\n. The performance of LLM did not show a significant correlation with the quality\nparameters of MCQs (DIF I, DI, DE). This suggests that LLMs can handle questions of varying difficulty,\ndiscrimination power, and distractor effectiveness with similar competence. This finding contrasts with a\nprevious study that stated that LLM accuracy declines with increasing MCQ difficulty \n[18]\n.\nMCQ number seven presented a challenge for all tested LLMs. This question involved calculating the mean\ncorpuscular volume (MCV = hematocrit ÷ RBC count in millions/mm³ × 10) and the mean corpuscular\nhemoglobin concentration (MCHC = hemoglobin in g/dL ÷ hematocrit × 100) for morphological classification\nof anemia. The correct answer was macrocytic normochromic anemia (MCV = 150 femtoliter, MCHC = 31%)\n \n2025 Agarwal et al. Cureus 17(4): e81871. DOI 10.7759/cureus.81871\n7\n of \n13\ncaused by folic acid deficiency. All LLMs incorrectly classified it as iron deficiency anemia, consistent with\nprior research suggesting chatbots struggle with hypothetical scenarios \n[19]\n.\nMCQ 19 included a negative statement in the stem, which likely confused some LLMs. MCQ 27 is a factual\nquestion that appeared in the Indian medical postgraduate entrance examination a few years ago. The\nquestion presented two closely related options: the burst-forming unit (BFU) and the colony-forming unit\n(CFU). The correct answer is CFU, as it has more erythropoietin receptors and responds better to\nerythropoietin \n[20]\n. Students or instructors might have Googled the question; therefore, only Google Gemini\ncan answer it accurately since it has access to Google's search database.\nWrong responses from generative AI can confuse medical students, leading them to learn incorrect medical\nfacts or concepts. This is particularly concerning in a field where accuracy is critical, as it could result in\npoor clinical practice later on. To address this issue, it is important to validate AI tools thoroughly, teach\nstudents to critically evaluate AI outputs, and ensure human experts oversee AI-generated content.\nImplications\nThe high performance of LLMs in blood physiology MCQs has a significant implication for medical\neducation. These models could be valuable supplementary tools for students preparing for MCQ-based\nexaminations. However, caution is warranted. Despite their high accuracy, even the best-performing model\nmade errors in 5% of questions. In medical education, such errors could lead to misconceptions, potentially\naffecting students' understanding of critical concepts. Therefore, we recommend that students use LLMs as\nsupplementary tools rather than primary learning resources. Based on the findings of the current study and\nprevious research, we recommend that educators consider using these tools to generate practice questions,\nsupport student self-assessment, and scaffold explanations for challenging topics while ensuring that AI-\ngenerated content is reviewed for accuracy \n[3,7,8,10-12]\n.\nFuture research should explore LLMs' ability to explain concepts rather than just providing correct answers\nto MCQs. This would help determine their potential as teaching tools beyond assessment aids. Additionally,\nadvanced LLM capabilities, such as DeepSeek's DeepThink (R1), ChatGPT's Reason, Gemini's Deep Research\nand Flash Thinking, and Grok's DeepSearch and Think, are available for use without a paid subscription\n(though access may be limited) and should be explored further for their educational applications in medical\ntraining.\nLimitations\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting our results. First, the study assessed LLMs using\nsingle best-answer MCQs. Performance might vary with other question formats, such as true or false\nquestions, case-based scenarios, or open-ended responses. Second, we evaluated LLMs using a specific\nprompt. Different prompting techniques might yield different results. Future studies could explore various\nprompting strategies to optimize LLM performance. Third, our study focused exclusively on blood\nphysiology. Performance might differ in other areas of medical physiology or clinical subjects. Future\nstudies should investigate broader physiological and medical topics. Fourth, we conducted testing on a\nsingle day (March 19, 2025). LLMs undergo frequent updates, so their performance might change over time.\nRegular evaluations are necessary to track ongoing improvements or regressions. Finally, the study included\nonly free-to-use LLMs available as Android applications. Premium or subscription-based models might offer\ndifferent performance characteristics, possibly yielding higher accuracy and reliability.\nConclusions\nOur study demonstrates that modern LLMs, particularly Claude, DeepSeek, and Grok, show remarkable\naccuracy and reliability in answering item-analyzed blood physiology MCQs. These findings suggest that\nLLMs could be valuable supplementary medical education tools. However, even the best-performing models\nmade errors, emphasizing the need for caution when using LLMs as learning aids. Students and educators\nshould use these tools to complement, rather than replace, traditional teaching methods and expert\nguidance.\nAs LLM technology continues to evolve, its role in medical education must be continuously reassessed.\nRegular evaluation of LLM accuracy, reliability, and educational effectiveness will ensure that these\npowerful tools are optimally integrated into medical curricula while minimizing potential risks.\nAppendices\nMCQs\nCorrect\nOption\nNFD\nDE\nDIF\nI\nDI\n1.
