Chenget al.: Using Lumped Element Equivalent Network Model to Derive Analytical Equations for Interpretation\nas the frequency response is measured over a frequency range\nfrom a few Hz to several MHz, these variations in the induc-\ntances (L) and capacitances (C) modify the locations and/or\nnumbers of resonances in the FRA amplitude spectrum.\nAs transmission voltages increase over the years, trans-\nformers need to face more stringent requirements of Basic\nInsulation Levels (BIL). Therefore winding structures evolve,\neither from a single helical to a double helical or multi-layer\nwinding; or from a plain disc to an intershielded or interleaved\ndisc winding. Different winding designs, applied by trans-\nformer manufacturers, intrinsically increase the variations of\ncharacteristics in the measured FRA spectra.\nThe challenge of FRA technique lies in the correct inter-\npretation of the measured FRA spectra. Statistical indices\nwere used to objectively assess the differences in the FRA\nspectra measured before and after the fault [1], [2], as pro-\nduced by either laboratory experiments [3], [4] or simulation\nstudies [5]–[8]. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) was also used to\nprocess the FRA data to identify winding faults [9], [10]. Nev-\nertheless, a quantitative relationship linking winding geome-\ntry, equivalent electrical components, and the corresponding\nFRA measurement results is still desirable. In this respect,\nmathematical expressions were developed in [11] to correlate\nnatural frequencies of a ten-element equivalent circuit net-\nwork model with each individual electrical component of the\nwinding, and the correlations were veriﬁed using artiﬁcially\ncreated winding models and simulation results. The delta-\nand star-connection of the three-phase windings were then\nconsidered, nevertheless, other important inﬂuencing factors\nsuch as magnetizing inductance and the interaction between\nprimary and secondary windings were not included in this\nmathematic derivation exercise. When winding design data\nwas not accessible, attempts to establish transformer models\nand to correlate the measured frequency responses with the\ncorresponding electrical components, or even the geometric\ninformation, of windings, were carried out using various\noptimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm [12],\nGauss-Newton Iteration Algorithm [13] and Particle Swarm\nOptimization Algorithm [14]. Unfortunately, there is no\nIEC/IEEE standard for FRA interpretation at current stage,\nalthough a CIGRE Working Group A2.53 has recently been\nestablished and is now preparing a FRA technical brochure.\nElectromagnetic circuit theory is applied in this paper to\nmodel a transformer, and mathematical expressions are devel-\noped based on a circuit representation of the transformer to\ndescribe the relationship between FRA characteristics and the\nequivalent electrical components. Equation derivation ﬁrst\nconsiders single air core windings, and then the inﬂuenc-\ning factors are considered sequentially; the complexity is\nincreased by the inclusion of the iron core, and then the\nmutual inductive coupling between parts of a winding, and\ninductive and capacitive coupling between two windings\nwithin the same phase.\nIt should be mentioned that the FRA spectra in this\npaper are produced by the end-to-end open circuit FRA\nmeasurement method [15]–[17]. All the windings modeled\nFIGURE 1. Circuit model for single phase two-winding transformer.\nand analyzed in this paper are of uniform structure, i.e. the\nsame conductor, and equal number of turns per disc and\nnon-grated insulation along the entire winding. This is not\nan unusual assumption when considering the standardized\ndesign and manufacture practice introduced in 1980s. Never-\ntheless, practical cases such as tap winding inclusion are not\nconsidered here. In addition, the winding terminal conditions,\nsuch as the bushing and measurement set-up, are ignored for\nsimplicity, and the derived equations do not consider losses\nas they do not shift the resonant frequencies but only produce\na damping effect [6].\nII. SINGLE PHASE TWO WINDINGS TRANSFORMER\nA 144/13 kV 60 MV A single phase two-winding transformer\nmodel was constructed based on real transformer design data;\nthe low voltage (LV) winding is a single helical winding\nof 13 kV with 74 turns of conductor and the HV winding\nis an interleaved disc winding of 144 kV with 140 discs.\nFIGURE 1(a) shows the half axis-symmetric cross-sectional\ndiagram and FIGURE 1 (b) the equivalent circuit model,\nwhere each lumped unit represents either a double discs of the\ndisc type winding or a turn of the single helical/multi-layer\nwinding, of which the electrical parameters are calculated\nbased on winding geometry. By applying basic Circuit Anal-\nysis Theory onto the network model, the end-to-end open cir-\ncuit frequency responses can be calculated. The methodology\nto establish the equivalent circuit network model has been\nveriﬁed in [6], [7].\nTABLE 1 lists the electrical parameters and their total\nvalues, which are calculated based on winding geometry; the\nmagnetizing inductances as seen by both windings at 50 Hz\nare given. Note: to ensure the accuracy of the equivalent\ncircuit, it is important to include the mutual, inductive and\ncapacitive, coupling effects between the two windings [18].\nThe frequency resolution for all the FRA plots in this paper\nis provided in TABLE 2.\nThe magnetizing inductance is frequency dependent, and\nto reﬂect this attribute, the measurement results for the com-\nplex relative permeability of silicon steel lamination were\nextracted from [19] and a nonlinear regression algorithm is\nused to determine the ‘‘per unit value of measured relative\npermeability against frequency’’ as presented in FIGURE 2.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 179487\nB.

Their com-\nparison is shown in FIGURE 3, which demonstrates con-\nsidering frequency dependent magnetizing inductance or not\nhas a negligible effect. This is because µr has a negligible\ndifference for frequencies lower than 1 kHz and winding\ncapacitances also have shown their effects by jointly creating\nthe 1 st anti-resonance at around 1 kHz. For higher frequen-\ncies, the magnetizing inductance behaves as large shunt\nFIGURE 4. n-stage lumped-element LC ladder network of single winding.\nimpedance, losing its dominating status to the air core induc-\ntance and winding capacitances. Therefore the magnetizing\ninductance is regarded as a constant value in the following\nsimulation scenarios.\nIn FIGURE 3, the frequency response of the HV winding\nhas a lower magnitude than the LV winding, and the LV\nwinding has multiple oscillations in the high frequency region\nwhilst the HV winding has only a few resonant frequencies,\nwhich exactly accord with their winding characteristics.\nIII. SINGLE WINDING FRA INTERPRETATION\nAccording to both the IEEE and IEC standards [15], [16],\nthe FRA spectra can generally be divided into four frequency\nregions, the lowest is dominated by the transformer core,\nthe next by the winding interactions, then the structure of\nthe winding-under-test and ﬁnally the highest by the mea-\nsurement set-up. The ‘‘structure of the winding-under-test’’\nregion is mainly analyzed to determine winding deformation.\nModeling approach has a greater ﬂexibility of parameter\nmanipulation, which allows separating the electromagnetic\nand electrostatic effects of the grounded core. Firstly the\ntransformer is disassembled into two single air core wind-\nings, which are then used to quantify the inﬂuence of each\nelectrical winding component. Secondly, the complexity is\ngradually increased by taking the iron core into account, and\nthen mutual coupling between parts of the winding.\nA. TYPICAL FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF SINGLE\nAIR CORE WINDING\nIrrespective of the winding structure, any winding can be\ncategorized into two types based on its α value, α =\n√\nCg\nCs .\nOne has a high Cs hence small αtype (e.g. interleaved disc\nwinding), and the other has a low Cs hence large αtype (e.g.\nplain disc or single helical winding). The value of αis mainly\ncontrolled by variation of Cs, as a winding with a ﬁx voltage\nwould have similar values of Cg which is dominated by the\nmain insulation clearance between the winding and ground.\nThe simplest high frequency winding model consists of\nan n-stage lumped-element LC ladder network as shown in\nFIGURE 4, where the effect of mutual inductances between\nthe units are taken into account by L air as a lumped parameter\nrather than explicit representation, to ensure the use of analyt-\nical solutions to demonstrate the general patterns of frequency\nresponses.\nA general solution for voltage v and current i at any point\nx,(x =1,2,... n) of the network shown in FIGURE 4is\ndeveloped in [6], [21]–[23] and reproduced in APPENDIX\n179488 VOLUME 8, 2020\nB.

For LV winding with a large\nα, approximately 31, its FRA features multiple resonances\nand ‘U shape’ pseudo anti-resonances between the adjacent\nresonances [6], [20]. The FRA of an HV winding with a small\nα, approximately 1, one critical anti-resonance occurs at\n9.95 kHz and at higher frequencies, a smooth rising amplitude\ntrend can be seen, with signiﬁcantly fewer resonances.\nTABLE 3 compares the frequencies of resonances and\npseudo anti-resonances obtained from the FRA simulation\nand those calculated by (1) and (2).\nWhen analyzing FIGURE 5 and TABLE 3, it can be\nobserved α has a dominating effect on the shape of FRA\ncurve; when α is small, there are no multiple resonances\nexpected as the terms α2\n(kπ)2 in (1) and 4α2\n((2k−1)π)2 in (2) are too\nsmall to distinguish the resonant frequencies, f0k and fk from\nthe critical frequency fc. These equations mathematically\nexplain why the winding with low series capacitance such\nas plain disc windings and single helical windings always\nhave multiple resonances, whilst the winding with high series\ncapacitance such as interleaved disc type winding always\nhave fewer or no resonances.\nFIGURE 6. Typical FRA responses of single windings with core.\nB. TYPICAL FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF SINGLE WINDING\nWITH MAGNETIC CORE INCLUDED\nThe next step is to investigate the effect of the core by\nassuming a single winding is placed onto the transformer\ncore. This is equivalent to all the units of FIGURE 4 are\nnow fully coupled with one and another through the main\nﬂux in iron core and the air core inductance represented by\nLair remain the same as in section III-A. Hence the ﬁrst\nanti-resonance in the low frequency region would appear\nfor single windings with small α; this is the low frequency\nfeature we normally see on transformer FRA responses, and\na comparison is made between the frequency responses of\nthe windings with and without the magnetizing inductance,\nas presented in FIGURE 6.\nFIGURE 6 shows that due to the large value of mag-\nnetizing inductance, the magnitude of the HV winding fre-\nquency response at low frequencies has dropped by nearly\n40 dB when compared to the air core situation. The ﬁrst anti-\nresonance with the core is at 930 Hz. This ‘V shape’ ﬁrst\nanti-resonance fv is caused by the core and the bulk winding\ncapacitances, can be approximated by (3), with a correction\nfactor 1that involves the space coefﬁcient αof the winding,\nand the magnetic coupling factor β which depends on the\nmain ﬂux and air ﬂux linkages between the different parts\nof the winding:\nfv = 1\n2π√LT Cs\n√\n1\na14 +b12 +c =0\n12 =−b −\n√\nb2 −4ac\n2a\na =(1 −β)\n2 ,b =α2β\n8 −1,c =(1 +β)\n2 (3)\nVOLUME 8, 2020 179489\nB. Chenget al.: Using Lumped Element Equivalent Network Model to Derive Analytical Equations for Interpretation\nLT is the sum of the magnetizing inductance and air core\ninductance of the winding, LT =Lcore +Lair , and the mag-\nnetic coupling factor is deﬁned as β=M12\nL11\n, where M12 is the\nmutual-element and L11 is the self-element of the inductance\nmatrix of the winding model when n=2. In the case of the\nHV winding, β=0.992, and the ﬁrst anti-resonant frequency\nis approximated by (3) as fv =905 Hz, which is reasonably\nclose to 930 Hz as shown in FIGURE 6 (a). To clearly\ndemonstrate the importance of involving the correction factor\n1, the base frequency of the parallel resonance controlled by\nCs and of LT is calculated as 835 Hz.\nAs for the LV winding, due to the smaller number of\nturns linked with the main ﬂux in the core, its magnetizing\ninductance is too small to alter the domination of the large\nα, the FRA of the LV winding seen in FIGURE 6(b) has\nthe so called ‘U’ shape curve. If this is compared with the\nfrequency response of the single air core LV winding, it seems\nthe ﬁrst pseudo anti-resonant frequency has been shifted to a\nlower frequency due to the introduction of the magnetizing\ninductance, and there is no change in the other resonances.\nThe so called ‘U’ shape at the core dominant low frequency\nregion has been stated in [17], [20] as ‘‘. . . in the intermediate\nfrequency band (2-20 kHz), with the apparent absence of the\nusual ﬁrst low frequency minima and maxima’’, and ‘‘. . . is\nnot unique to shell form transformers, being occasionally\nseen for some core form units, e.g. delta connected HV wind-\nings’’.\nAlthough the transformer core is introduced into the model,\nFIGURE 6clearly demonstrated the high frequency features\non both the LV and HV winding FRA plots are only associ-\nated with the air core inductance, i.e. they do not change with\nthe inclusion of the magnetizing inductance.\nC. FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF SINGLE WINDING WITH\nMUTUAL COUPLING EXPLICITLY MODELED\nTransformers are designed to ensure efﬁcient operation by\narranging for the primary and secondary windings to be\nmagnetically strongly coupled; hence the mutual inductances\nbetween these windings and parts of the same winding are\nsigniﬁcant. Primary and secondary windings on the same\nlimb share the same main ﬂux, but experience different leak-\nage ﬂuxes. A ﬁxed value of transformer impedance can be\nachieved by carefully designing the winding dimensions as\nwell as the radial insulation distance between them. Con-\nsequently, magnetic coupling can only be accurately mod-\neled by using the full n ×n inductive matrix. Note the\nnumber of elements in this matrix can be varied accord-\ning to the frequency region being investigated; as a rule of\nthumb, the higher the frequency and the more the oscillation,\nthe larger the value of n would be required.\nThe next step is to represent mutual inductive coupling\nby accurately modeling the full inductance matrix of the\nair core winding. The air core mutual inductances between\nevery two units in FIGURE 4 is no longer lumped into\nLair , instead they are calculated and distributed across\nthe inductance matrix according to the winding geometry;\nFIGURE 7. Typical FRA responses of single windings with core and mutual\ninductance explicitly modeled.\nmeanwhile, the magnetizing inductance is also taken into\naccount. FIGURE 7shows the effect of explicitly modeling\nthe mutual inductances on the frequency responses of the LV\nand HV windings.\nIt can be seen that by taking mutual inductances explicitly\ninto consideration, the resonant, anti-resonant and pseudo\nanti-resonant frequencies of the FRA in the high frequency\nregion are all moved up to higher frequencies, as marked in\nFIGURE 7(a) and (b).\nThe section number n of the model determines the number\nof resonances in the corresponding FRA plot, i.e. n sections\nusually produce n-1 resonances as long as α is big enough;\nhowever having n +2 elements in a model ensures the n th res-\nonance is obtained with reasonable accuracy. In this regard,\nthe shift of the ﬁrst resonance and anti-resonance in the high\nfrequency region for both the LV and HV winding frequency\nresponses can be quantiﬁed by applying a correction factor\n1air into (1) and (2), the corrected equations are:\nf1m = 1\n2π√Lair Cs\n1√\n1 + α2\n(kπ)2\n√\n1air\nf01m = 1\n2π√Lair Cs\n1√\n1 + 4α2\n((2k−1)π)2\n√\n1air\n1air =1 +βair ,k =1 (4)\nwhere f1m and f01m represent the ﬁrst resonant and anti-\nresonant frequencies in the high frequency region after con-\nsidering mutual inductances in a full inductive matrix, and\n179490 VOLUME 8, 2020\nB.

The value for\nthe LV winding is calculated as βairLV =0.316 and the value\nfor the HV winding is calculated as βairHV =0.565; these are\ndetermined by the winding structure.\nTABLE 4 gives the relationship of the ﬁrst resonant and\nanti-resonant frequencies in the FRA plots with or without\nmutual inductance explicitly modeled. Equation (4) recon-\nﬁrms the advantage of using a ratio of frequencies to reﬂect\nthe frequency shifting [24]. Note the ﬁrst anti-resonance in\nthe low frequency region is mainly controlled by the core\ninductance and hence is not affected by mutual coupling.\nTherefore (3) is still valid for this scenario.\nIV. INVESTIGATION OF FREQUENCY RESPONSES FOR\nSINGLE PHASE TWO-WINDING TRANSFORMER\nApart from the structure of the winding-under-test, the\nuntested winding also inﬂuences the FRA spectrum through\nwinding interaction. To demonstrate the inﬂuence of the\nuntested winding on the FRA measurements of a transformer,\nthe model described in FIGURE 1is used in this section.\nThe LV and HV winding FRA plots before and after\nthey are placed onto a transformer core (with both windings\nincluded) is presented in FIGURE 8and FIGURE 9. The LV\nwinding frequency response in the low and middle frequency\nregions is clearly affected by the HV winding; a typical ‘V\nshape’ anti-resonance fv appears at 790 Hz, and a few new\nFIGURE 9. Comparison of HV winding FRA plots before and after LV\nwinding is added.\nresonances appear at 10.25 kHz and beyond, which is in\nthe winding interaction dominant frequency region. However,\nthe frequency shift observed in the HV winding frequency\nresponse when the LV winding is present, is minimal. The\nwinding frequency responses in the high frequency region\nare dominated by the structure of winding-under-test and\nhave negligible difference, which accords with the results\npresented in [15], [16].\nThe following sections focus on the impacts of the untested\nwinding on the FRA measurement result, the impact can be\ndivided into two parts according to the frequency region; ﬁrst\nlow frequencies dominated by the transformer core and then\nmedium frequencies dominated by winding interaction.\nA. LOW FREQUENCY REGION\nThe core dominated frequency region is conventionally\nregarded as frequencies less than 2 kHz, and generally a\nﬁrst anti-resonance exists for the FRA measurement results\nfrom the HV and LV windings. This indicates the con-\nventional space coefﬁcient α, seen for a single winding is\nno longer able to explain the low frequency characteristic\nof the FRA response for the windings in an actual trans-\nformer. As compared in FIGURE 8, the differences in the\nLV winding FRA plots before and after the winding is placed\nonto a transformer core is prominent. The plots show the\nFRA magnitude responses at frequencies lower than 100 Hz\nare not changed, but the newly created anti-resonance at\n790 Hz is the deﬁnitive result of being coupled with the HV\nwinding.\nSimulation results indicate the winding FRA results in the\nlow frequency region are not only determined by its magne-\ntizing inductance and its own winding capacitances, but are\nalso inﬂuenced by the un-tested winding capacitances result-\ning from winding interaction. This inﬂuence combined with\nthe tested winding series capacitance produces the equivalent\nseries capacitance Ces seen from the terminals of the tested\nwinding. In addition, it is also natural to involve the concept\nof equivalent winding ground capacitance Ceg which deﬁnes\nthe shunt capacitance to ground potential seen from the tested\nwinding terminals. Hence the concept of α continues to be\nused for this single phase two-winding transformer, but is\nnow redeﬁned as α =\n√\nCeg\nCes , where C es and C eg can be\napproximately estimated using the four port equivalent circuit\nVOLUME 8, 2020 179491\nB.

Four port equivalent network of single phase two-winding\ntransformer.\nmodel of the single phase two-winding transformer, shown in\nFIGURE 10.\nFIGURE 10shows that because of the large voltage ratio\nbetween the HV and LV windings, which is similar to a\ngenerator transformer, the voltage difference induced in the\nuntested winding is determined by the turns ratio and the\npotentials of the ﬂoating terminals can be estimated based\non the equivalent capacitive network. Taking the circuit in\nFIGURE 10(a) as example, where V1 is ﬁxed at 1 per unit\nby the measurement setup, the voltage difference V3-V4 is\nN per unit, where N is the turn ratio of HV to LV windings.\nHowever, the four port model of FIGURE 10is only valid\nfor the analysis of the FRA plot in the low frequency region.\nNevertheless, for a winding-under-test operating within a\ntransformer, the resulting ‘new’ Ces and Ceg for both LV and\nHV windings can be estimated by (5) and (6), respectively,\nthe detailed derivation of (5) and (6) can be found in [20].\nEquation (5) helps explain why the equivalent winding\nseries capacitance for a single helical winding is signiﬁcant\nwhen it is used for the LV winding in a transformer with a\nlarge voltage ratio. (5) also provides insight on the ‘equiva-\nlent’ winding series capacitance as highlighted by the mag-\nnifying factor of ‘‘turns ratio squared’’ on the inter-winding\ncapacitance as well as the series capacitance of the winding-\nnot-under-test, and as a result, the equivalent space coefﬁcient\nαis tremendously decreased. Using this insight it is observed\nthe LV single helical winding in this transformer has a typical\nﬁrst anti-resonance as shown in FIGURE 8.\nCes =CsL +CsH N2 +(N2 −4N +4)\n8 C\nHL\nCeg =CgL +CgH for LV winding (5)\nCes =CsH\nCeg =CHL ×CgL\nCHL +CgL\n+CgH for HV winding (6)\nHowever, when the HV winding is FRA tested as shown\nin FIGURE 10(b), the voltage difference V3-V4 is nearly\n1 per unit at the ﬁrst anti-resonance of the HV FRA spec-\ntrum. This is because 50  is much smaller than the HV\nwinding impedance, and the voltage difference V1-V2 is 1\nN\nper unit according to the voltage ratio between windings.\nTABLE 5. Equivalent Ces, Ceg and a of winding-under-test.\nThis means the inﬂuence of the LV winding series capac-\nitance is negligible, thus the HV winding equivalent series\ncapacitance remains the same before and after it is located\nnear the LV winding, and the equivalent shunt capacitance\nto ground increases which ultimately increase its equivalent\nspace coefﬁcient α. Equation (6) helps our understanding of\nthe reason for the small change in the ﬁrst anti-resonance as\nshown in FIGURE 9.\nThe equivalent series and ground capacitances calculated\nby (5) and (6) are provided in TABLE 5 for both windings,\nand are then used to calculate the redeﬁned equivalent space\ncoefﬁcient α.\nThe redeﬁned space coefﬁcient α in TABLE 5 conﬁrms\nthe earlier conclusion ‘‘the space coefﬁcient α determines\nthe shape of the frequency response’’. For this example,\nα =0.337 for the LV winding when the HV winding is\ninvolved and α =1.499 for the HV winding when the LV\nwinding is involved. Such small values of α produce very\nclear ‘V shape’ anti-resonance in the low frequency region.\nIn addition, the small change of αseen from the HV winding\nbefore and after involving the LV winding explains the rela-\ntive small changes on the corresponding ﬁrst anti-resonance.\nThe calculated equivalent capacitances seen from the tested\nwinding terminals and involving the redeﬁned space coefﬁ-\ncient α, allows (3) to be used to approximate the ﬁrst anti-\nresonant frequencies of the LV and HV winding FRA plots\nin this single phase two-winding transformer. The calculated\nfrequency of the ﬁrst anti-resonance for the LV winding is\n813 Hz, as compared with 790 Hz in FIGURE 8, and the\ncalculated frequency of the ﬁrst anti-resonance for the HV\nwinding is 984 Hz, as compared with 1020 Hz in FIGURE 9,\nrespectively. To clearly demonstrate the importance of involv-\ning the correction factor 1 in (3), the base frequencies of\nthe parallel resonance controlled by Ces and of LT are cal-\nculated, given as 808 Hz for LV winding and 837 Hz for\nHV winding. These approximations are reasonably close to\nthe frequencies, indicating the validity of the equations and\nhighlighting the relationships between the FRA characteris-\ntics and the electrical components in the equivalent circuit\nnetwork.\nB. INTERACTION IN MEDIUM FREQUENCY REGION\nFIGURE 8shows that the characteristics of the HV wind-\ning structure in the frequency region around 10 kHz, have\nbeen transferred through winding interaction, i.e. mutual\ninductive and capacitive couplings, to the LV winding FRA\nplot. However, FIGURE 9shows the LV winding has fewer\nturns, resulting in lower air core inductances and winding\n179492 VOLUME 8, 2020\nB. Chenget al.: Using Lumped Element Equivalent Network Model to Derive Analytical Equations for Interpretation\nFIGURE 11. Half axis-symmetric cross-sectional diagram of winding axial\ndeformation.\ncapacitances, therefore it has minimal effect on the HV wind-\ning FRA plot. It can also be observed the ﬁrst pseudo anti-\nresonance just after the frequency of 100 kHz, can be seen\nas a slight ‘‘kink’’ in the smooth capacitive rising magnitude\nslope of the HV FRA plot.\nThe medium frequency region is dominated by the inter-\naction between the two windings, which is of interest when\nconsidering winding deformation occurring in the HV wind-\ning. It is reﬂected not only in the frequency response of\nthe winding-under-test, but also in the frequency response\nof the untested winding in the medium frequency winding\ninteraction region.\nIn this section, partial winding displacement in the axial\ndirection is modeled individually for both windings. In the\nmid-part of the LV winding, the inter-turn distances from LV\nturn 27 to turn 48, counting from top to bottom, are decreased\nto 10% of the original value. In the mid-part of the HV\nwinding, the inter-disc distances from HV disc 49 to disc 92,\nare decreased to 10% of the original value. Therefore the total\nheight of LV winding decreases from the original 2.27 m to\n2.13 m, and the HV winding shrinks from the original height\nof 2.28 m to 2.11 m, the shrinkage of winding is illustrated\nin FIGURE 11.FIGURE 12shows the frequency responses\nwith and without the axial winding deformation.\nIn FIGURE 12(a), when the LV winding is partially axial-\ndeformed, there is an observable left-shift of the resonance\nin the high frequency region for the LV winding frequency\nresponse. This region is dominated by the structure of the\nwinding-under-test, whilst the frequency response of the HV\nwinding shows almost no effect. This is understandable as the\nLV winding is ‘weak’ relative to the HV winding from the\nelectrostatic and electromagnetic perspective, i.e. less turns\nmeans less inductance; and because of the simpler winding\nstructure, smaller winding series capacitance.\nHowever, when the HV winding is partially axial-\ndeformed, both the HV and LV winding frequency responses\nshow changes as given in in FIGURE 12(b). The HV FRA\nplot is affected in the low, medium and high frequency ranges\nby the deformation as the ﬁrst anti-resonance shifts to the left\nfrom 1020 Hz to 960 Hz, and a pair of new resonance and\nanti-resonance are created at around 13.2 kHz, but for the LV\nwinding, only the frequency responses in the low and medium\nfrequency regions are impacted, the ﬁrst anti-resonance shifts\nFIGURE 12. Frequency responses before and after winding axial\ndeformation.\nto the left from 790 Hz to 730 Hz, and the ﬁrst resonance\nshifts from 10.25 kHz to 8.7 kHz. This is understandable as\nthe deformation of HV winding, through inductive and capac-\nitive coupling, passes its effect onto the frequency response\nof LV winding; however the high frequency ‘‘winding struc-\nture dominant’’ frequency region shows no difference in\nFIGURE 12(b), which is signiﬁcant in interpreting the FRA\nmeasurement results.\nThe above results indicate that the medium frequency\nregion of the ‘unsuspected’ winding frequency response can\nbe used as a supplement to verify if deformation occurs on the\nother ‘suspected’ winding, especially when it is the ‘strong’\nwinding, here ‘strong’ means a winding has more turns hence\nlarger inductance; and with a sophisticated winding structure\nwhich leads to bigger winding series capacitance.\nAlthough only one example of axial deformation is sim-\nulated and analyzed here, it is recognized that many types\nof winding deformations such as tilting, spiraling and tele-\nscoping and radial deformation can be modeled to investigate\nthe uniqueness of frequency response features associated with\neach type of deformation. For all cases, it is envisaged that the\ndeformation of the ‘strong’ winding would pass its inﬂuence\nonto the frequency responses of the healthy windings in the\nwinding interaction frequency region.\nV. CONCLUSION\nMathematical equations are derived in this paper to reveal\nthe relationships between the winding geometry dependent\nelectrical components of the equivalent circuit network mod-\nels and the resonant frequencies observed in FRA spectra.\nAir-core single windings were ﬁrst modeled, and then more\nrealistic scenarios developed in steps, by ﬁrst adding the\nVOLUME 8, 2020 179493\nB.

All the simulation results are provided to validate\nthe developed equations.\nEquations (1) and (2), developed in [6], [21]–[23] for a\nsingle air-core winding, are rewritten to explicitly express\nthe space coefﬁcient αand demonstrate its inﬂuence on the\npatterns of frequency responses. Equation (3) is derived to\nconsider the magnetizing effect of an iron core on a sin-\ngle winding, and is then used to explain the ﬁrst minimum\nas seen in the low frequency region of the measured FRA\nresults. This minimum is dominated by the key parameters\nof magnetizing inductance and winding series capacitance,\nalthough the effects of mutual inductive coupling and the\nspace coefﬁcient of the winding should not be neglected. The\nsigniﬁcance of these effects is mathematically given by (3)\nand various case studies associated with this equation can be\nfound in [25]. Mutual inductive coupling among units of a\nwinding is important as it shifts the resonant and anti-resonant\nfrequencies; (4) was derived to demonstrate the correction\nfactor that needs to be applied to (1) and (2). This factor is\ndetermined by the magnetic coupling between parts of the air\ncore winding.\nIn addition to analyzing single winding FRA character-\nistics, the frequency responses of the windings of a large\nvoltage ratio single phase transformer, are also investi-\ngated. Equations (5) and (6) are developed to provide an\ninsight on how to calculate the total values of the equiv-\nalent capacitances seen from winding terminals in a FRA\nstandard test. This allows (3) to be used to approximate\nthe ﬁrst anti-resonant frequencies of the LV and HV wind-\ning FRA plots, proving the validity of the equations and\nhighlighting the relationships between the FRA characteris-\ntics and the electrical components in the equivalent circuit\nnetwork.\nThe equations developed in this paper provide an insightful\nquantitative relationship between the values of the electrical\nwinding components and the corresponding FRA character-\nistics. They consequently help our understanding of FRA\nspectra and their interpretation.\nVI.
