    "abstract": "Machine learning is widely used in various practical applications with deep learning models demonstrating advantages in handling huge data. Treating music as a special language and using deep learning models to accomplish melody recognition, music generation, and music analysis has proven feasible. In certain music-related deep learning research, recurrent neural networks have been replaced with transformers. This has achieved significant results. In traditional approaches with recurrent neural networks, input sequences are limited in length. This paper proposes a method to generate chord progressions for melodies using a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model, which is divided into a pre-trained encoder and decoder. A pre-trained encoder extracts contextual information from melodies, whereas a decoder uses this information to produce chords asynchronously and finally outputs chord progressions. The proposed method addresses length limitation issues while considering the harmony between chord progressions and melodies. Chord progressions can be generated for melodies in practical music composition applications. Evaluation experiments are conducted using the proposed method and three baseline models. The baseline models included the bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM), bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT2). The proposed method outperformed the baseline models in Hits@k (k = 1) by 25.89, 1.54, and 2.13 %, respectively.",
