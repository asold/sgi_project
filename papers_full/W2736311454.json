Siqueira & Eduardo B. Ottoni\nCapuchin monkeys at Serra da Capivara National Park (SCNP) usually forage on the ground for roots and \nfossorial arthropods, digging primarily with their hands but also using stone tools to loosen the soil and \naid the digging process. Here we describe the stone tools used for digging by two groups of capuchins \non SCNP . Both groups used tools while digging three main food resources: Thiloa glaucocarpa tubers, \nOcotea sp roots, and trapdoor spiders. One explanation for the occurrence of tool use in primates is the \n“necessity hypothesis”, which states that the main function of tool use is to obtain fallback food. We \ntested for this, but only found a positive correlation between plant food availability and the frequency \nof stone tools’ use. Thus, our data do not support the fallback food hypothesis for the use of tools to \naccess burrowed resources.\nCapuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp and Cebus spp) use extractive foraging techniques – sometimes tool-aided - to \nobtain hard-to-acquire food, like larvae from tree branches/bark or encased seeds\n1–5; some Sapajus populations \nuse probe tools to expel small prey, dip for honey and fish termites 6–8. Another hard to obtain, concealed, food \nsometimes consumed by primates are plants’ Underground Storage Organs (USOs), usually rich in carbohydrates.\nFallback food is constantly proposed as an important selective force that could determine primate anatomy, \ninfluence grouping and ranging behavior, and trigger adaptation processes in primate evolution 9, 10. The use of \nUSOs as fallback food (a less preferred resource used during food shortage) is a selective force in some models on \nprimate and human evolution9, 11, which state humans would have used this kind of resource during the shortage \nof food in dry seasons.\nFallback food classification has been proposed depending on the preferred food quality and the fallback food \navailable9. The term “staple fallback foods” can be used to describe resources that are used as the only food in \nperiods of low availability of preferred food. On the other hand, “filler fallback foods” can be defined as resources \nthat do not encompass the entire diet at the low food period\n12. Usually low quality food (leaves, bark) requires \nmore processing and anatomical adaptations, and high quality food (eg fruits and seeds) depend more on the \nbehavioral adaptations for foraging the food\n13.\nUntil recently, it was thought chimpanzees could be a good model for the use of USOs as fallback food by pri-\nmates, because they dig for the USOs of some plants, in some cases using tools14–16. This practice was interpreted \nas a fallback food strategy 11. More detailed studies showed that it was not the case, since chimpanzees use this \nresource more frequently during the food-rich wet season14, thus not supporting the fallback strategy.\nCapuchin monkeys (Sapajus  spp and Cebus  spp) are New World primates that have a large area of occur -\nrence in Central and South America, inhabiting diverse environments, from rainforests to dry-bush forest, and \nsemi-arid areas\n17. In tropical forests, they do not usually forage for roots or USOs 18, 19, but there are reports of \ncrop raid on cassava tubers in groups of Sapajus nigritus20. More terrestrial populations, like S. libidinosus living \nin savannah environments such as Caatinga, may forage frequently on roots and USOs7, 21, 22.\nThe S. libidinosus population of Serra da Capivara National Park (SCNP) has the largest known tool kit for \nwild capuchin monkeys, including stone tools for foraging 1, 7, 21, 23, threat24 and sexual displays 25; and sticks as \nprobing tools6, 7, 26. Moreover, capuchin monkeys at SCNP usually forage on the ground for various roots and \nfossorial arthropods, digging mainly with their hands but also using stone tools to loosen the soil and aid the \ndigging process\n7.\nOne of the explanations for the innovation and maintenance of tool use is the “necessity hypothesis” , that states \ntool use is maintained by the need to access fallback food during times of preferred food scarcity, like dry sea-\nsons\n27, 28. Koops et al.27 tested the “necessity hypothesis” for tool-assisted insectivory in chimpanzees, but found \nthat although the termites and ants caught with tools were present during times of scarcity, they were not used as \nfallback food, and nuts cracked with stone tools were not available during food shortage periods.\nDept. of Experimental Psychology – Institute of Psychology, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP , Brazil. \nCorrespondence and requests for materials should be addressed to T.F.

In this same study, the “opportunity hypothesis” - tool use \ninnovation sustained by repeated exposure to appropriate ecological conditions, like the availability of both food \nthat requires tools for processing and potential tools - was also tested and supported.\nHere we (1) describe the stone tools used to aid digging by two groups of capuchins in SCNP during two years, \nand the characteristics of the stone tools, (2) compare the data to observations from other groups living 15 km \napart in the same park, by Mannu and Ottoni 7 and Moura and Lee21, 23, and (3) test the “necessity hypothesis” \nfor digging stone tools’ use. If this hypothesis is to be supported, we expect the frequency of tool use to be higher \nwhen the overall food availability is lower (eg. in the dry season). We used the monthly availability of arthropods \nand plant items (fruits/seeds/flowers) in the area as measures of food availability.\nMethods\nStudy site. The research was conducted in Serra da Capivara National Park (Piauí State, northeastern Brazil). \nThe park is located at the geoclimatic domain of the Caatinga, semi-arid climate with vegetation composed of \na mosaic of xerophytic vegetation and patches of deciduous forest at narrow, wetter valleys surrounded by high \ncliffs. The annual rainfall is concentrated in the short wet season, from November to March. The study area was \nthe Boqueirão da Pedra Furada, in the southeastern border of the park (8°50′S, 42°33′W).\nStudy groups. We observed two not previously studied groups with overlapping living areas. At the begin-\nning of the study, Pedra Furada (PF) group was composed of 45 individuals, and Bocão (BC) group had 27 \nindividuals. The two groups sometimes met and foraged in the same area for minutes or hours, but no agonistic \nencounters were registered between them. Agonistic episodes occurred between individuals from the two groups, \nbut did not include the whole groups. Capuchin monkeys at SCNP obtain most of their food by exploiting nat-\nurally occurring resources, but the park staff provisioned both groups during the dry season. The provisions \nconsisted of fruits (3–4 times a week) and dry corn (every 2 weeks). The corn was meant for other animals in the \npark, but the monkeys also cosumed it.\nObservation Method. The group was followed from dawn to dusk, with the help of a field assistant, and \ntool use (as defined by Shumaker, Walkup, and Beck)29 episodes were recorded by “ All Occurrences” sampling30. \nTool use is infrequent when compared to other behaviors from capuchin monkeys’ repertoire, making “Focal \nSampling” an inadequate method when trying to register tool use, so we choose the “ All Occurrences” sampling \nas a more viable method, even if it makes the individual analysis more difficult.\nTool use behaviors were registered by voice and/or by video. The monkey (or its sex and age group when \nindividual identification was not possible), and the target were identified when possible. We used the following \nage categories: infant (0–2 years), juvenile (2–5 years), subadult (only males, 5–7 years), and adult (more than 7 \nyears or 1\nst pregnancy). Most ages were estimated at the beginning of data collection, because the groups were not \npreviously studied.\nThe tool use rate was calculated by summing up all tool use episodes observed in a month and dividing it by \nthe number of contact hours with that group and by the number of individuals in the group that month, so this \ndata is presented in the form “episodes/h/individual” .\nThe stone tools were collected after the monkey left the excavation site, whenever we were sure about the \nstone actually used by the subject. We measured the weight, length, width and thickness of the collected tools (for \ndetails on the measurement methodology, see Falótico and Ottoni)\n1.\nMeteorological data. The rainfall data were provided by the Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (INMET), \ncollected from the São Raimundo Nonato automatic meteorological station 31 located about 27 km from the \nresearch area. This was the closest meteorological station at the time of the research.\nFood availability. For the measurement of food availability, we used a transect covering the three topogra-\nphies of the area (plain, valley and mesa). It comprised 130 points total (26 in plain, 7 in valley and 97 in mesa; \n30–40 m apart), each of them containing one plant matter collector (345 cm\n2 of area) and one pitfall trap (78.5 cm2 \nof area). The three environments were sampled according to their representative cover of the park area, in an area \n5 km from the groups home ranges, to avoid tourist visiting areas. We retrieved the material monthly, drying, \nweighting and identifying the plant matter (flowers, fruits and seeds) from the collectors, and the arthropods \nfrom the traps. These data are presented in g/m\n2.\nWe also collected, by digging, some of the trapdoor spiders in the area, to identify the species the monkeys \ncould be preying on. Because we could not get the actual spiders the monkeys captured, we are assuming they \nwere predating some of the species we collected.\nStatistical analyses.  Because of the nature of the data on tool use, i.e., low frequency and longitudinal \nrepeated measures, we applied Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to control for unequal repetition of \nthe same individuals over time when analyzing the individual tool use frequencies\n32. We used a GLMM model \nto test the effect of the following independent variables on dependent variable tool use counts: rain precipitation, \narthropod, and plant matter production per area. The Poisson distribution for dependent variables was used to \ncorrect for the excess of zeroes on the tables, the logarithmic link function was used, with individuals as a random \neffect, and logarithm of time of contact was used as offset variable in order to normalize the dependent variable.\nTo compare food availability between dry and rainy seasons, we used a GLMM model to test the effect of the \nindependent variable rain precipitation (fixed effect) on each target dependent variable (arthropod and plant) \nmatter availability on. A gamma distribution for dependent variable was used, with a log link function. The \ntopography area (plain, valley and mesa) of the collectors was used as random effect.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nSCIEnTIFIC  REPORTS  | 7: 6278 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-06541-0\nWe used a GLMM model to test the main effect of the independent variables sex, age class, and resource \n(louro, spider, USOs), and interaction effect sex-age on dependent variable stone tool use success (the frequency \nof the stone tool use events in which the resource was effectively obtained). A binomial distribution for dependent \nvariable was used, with the logit link function, and with individual and group as random effects.\nTo compare the dimensions of the stone tools between groups, sex, ages classes we used GLMM model to \ntest the effect of the independent variables sex, age class and resource on dependent variables stone tool size and \nweight. Normal distribution for dependent variable was used, with the identity link function, and with individual \nand group as random effect. Resource was used as a fixed control effect.\nAll tests were analyzed with a 0.05 significance level with Bonferroni correction, and all analyses were per -\nformed in IBM SPSS Statistics 23.\nEthical Note. The research in SCNP was previously approved by IBAMA/ICMBio (authorizations 037/2007 \nand 14825-1), adhered to the American Society of Primatologists principles for the ethical treatment of primates, \nand followed all ethical guidelines for animal research of the Institute of Psychology-USP .\nData Availability. The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from \nthe corresponding author on reasonable request.\nResults\nThe groups were systematically followed for 20 days per month, from initial visual contact in the morning until \nthe end of the day or the loss of contact with the group. The data from PF group were collected for 23 months (Sep \n2007–Jul 2009 - total contact time of 1290.23 h), and from BC group, for 12 months (Mar 2008–Feb 2009 - total \ncontact time of 426.36 h).\nWe registered 1702 episodes of digging with stone tools by monkeys of the two groups (Fig. 1; Supplementary \nVideo S1); the rate of occurrence of stone-aided digging was 0.0125 ep/h/indiv. Most (95%) adults/subadults \nindividuals from both groups (N = 44) were registered using stone tools for digging during this study (see \nSupplementary Table S2 for individual frequencies). The typical use of the stones was as Digging Stone Tools \n(DST) to loosen the soil, using the stone tool as a percutor to do so; however, some stones were also used to pull \nthe dirt from the digging site, as “hoes” . The latter was classified as a subcategory (DSTh).\nSeveral food items were targeted by the monkeys when digging (Fig.  2). Digging could be performed in a \npreviously dug site or in an unexplored site. When the monkeys were looking for roots, they frequently re-used \nFigure 1. Male capuchin monkey digging with a DST.\nFigure 2. Food items searched by the monkeys with the aid of DSTs. Unidentified resources correspond to \nepisodes in which we were unable to determine the target resource even after site inspection.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n4\nSCIEnTIFIC  REPORTS  | 7: 6278 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-06541-0\nsites previously dug not only by monkeys, but also by collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) that consume some of the \nsame roots (TF , personal observation).\nThe most frequently dug up resources were farinha -seca USOs (Thiloa glaucocarpa – Fam. Combretaceae). \nThese USOs can reach 10 cm length (Fig. 3) and are rich in carbohydrates. The roots did not appear to be con-\nsumed, so the target was the tuber. Although the leaves of this species are toxic to cattle, containing tannins and \nsaponins33, the roots do not seem to be toxic to the monkeys.\nThe consumption of the USOs after excavation also required the removal of the external fibrous hard layer, \nwhich was usually done with the hands and teeth. However, in some occasions, the monkeys used stones to smash \nthe USOs and thus access the inner edible part, especially if the USO was large1.\nAnother widely used resource were the roots of the louro tree (Ocotea sp - Fam. Lauraceae), dug up beside the \ntrunk of the tree (Fig. 4). The monkeys peel the dark-skinned roots before the consumption of their cores, usually \nby rubbing the roots between the hands or against trunks or rocks.\nThe most excavated resource besides plants’ USOs were trapdoor spiders (e.g. Actinopus  sp – family \nActinopodidae; Magula sp – family Theraphosidae; unknown spp – family Nemesiidae). These spiders build \nweb-coated tunnels and cover the entrance with a camouflaged web cap (Fig. 5). While foraging on the ground, \nmonkeys find the web cap, identifying the tunnel and initiating the excavation (Supplementary Videos S3 and S4).\nThe overall success rate in tool use episodes (acquisition and consumption of the resource/n events) was 38%, \nand when the episodes were classified by age and resource, there were significant differences (Fig. 6).\nThe juveniles had a lower overall success rate than the adults (GLMM, F 4.903, df1 = 1, df2 = 636, p = 0.027). \nAlthough similar in performance to adults when digging for roots, juveniles performed much worse when trying \nto dig spiders and USOs (Fig. 6).\nDST use by males was much more frequent (77%, N = 1135) than by females (23%, N = 429). There was no \ndifference, though, between the success rates of each sex (GLMM, F 0.632, df1 = 1, df2 = 636, p = 0.427).\nWe collected and measured 703 stone tools (Table 1). Most were used only as DSTs, but 25 were also used as \nDSTh (to pull the loosened soil).\nFigure 3. Thiloa glaucocarpa underground storage organs (USOs). Scale: 10 cm.\nFigure 4.

Adults/subadults were also more efficient using these \ntools (47.5% success rate) than juveniles (32.5%) - GLMM, F = 5.740, df1 = 1, df2 = 832, P = 0.017.\nMean\nWeight 126.1 ± SD 124.8 mm\nLength 6.2 ± SD 2.0 mm\nWidth 4.0 ± SD 1.3 mm\nThickness 3.0 ± SD 1.0 mm\nTable 1.

We could identify 43 events (2.52% from total) in which the DSTs were \nalso used as “hoes” (DSTh) to pull the dirt from the digging site. This behavior was observed in both groups (PF- \n31, BC-12) and by both sexes (Males-36, Females-5, Unknown-2), albeit with a great male bias.\nGroup comparisons. Compared to the other SCNP capuchin groups studied before7, 21, PF/BC groups used \nstone tools for digging with similar frequency of that reported by Mannu and Ottoni 7, 0.013 ep/h/indiv versus \n0.010 ep/h/indiv; and less frequently than reported by Moura and Lee 21, 0.028 ep/h/indiv. PF/BC groups had a \nhigher overall success rate than the groups studied by Mannu and Ottoni (38% versus 21.6%), and a similar rate \nto that reported by Moura and Lee (40.8%).\nFood availability. The arthropods and plant matter collection provided indirect measures of the monthly \nfood availability in the area (Fig.  7). The correlation between rain precipitation and resource abundance was \nsignificant, but very weak, for both arthropods (GLMM, F = 4.504, df1 = 1, df2 = 66, B = −0.002, p = 0.038) and \nplant matter (GLMM, F = 30.890, df1 = 1, df2 = 64, B = 0.006, p < 0.001). The correlation was negative for arthro-\npods and positive for plant matter.\nThe GLMM to test the main effects of tool use rate, food availability and rain precipitation, involved a regres-\nsion of the individual monthly tool use rate, based on a Poisson distribution (Table 6). The only significant main \neffect was the availability of plant matter. Moreover, the effect was positive, meaning that stone tool use for dig-\nging happened more frequently when more plant matter were available.

So far, this is the only known capuchin monkey population where the use of digging tools is a \ncustomary behavior.\nThere were differences in the size of the tools used by juveniles and adults, and by males and females, probably \nbecause of their different body sizes, but these differences did not seem to affect the use of the tools. The stone \ntools used to dig Ocotea  roots were heavier and thicker - which could be a consequence of a different soil (e.g. \nmore compact) around those trees (soil texture was not measured, though).\nDespite the digging technique being similar for all resources, some resources are harder to locate than oth-\ners, probably requiring more experience to be exploited, which could explain the higher success rates of adults, \nas compared to juveniles’ , for some kinds of resources. The Ocotea roots (for which the success rates have little \ndifference between these age groups) are very easy to locate and can be dug from already used sites, because this \nresource (the root) is not quickly exhausted (as are discrete items like spiders or USOs).\nThe detection of spiders and USOs seems much more difficult. Trapdoor spiders are solitary - there is only \none per tunnel (once the prey is eaten the site is depleted). Moreover, the monkeys must learn to identify the web \ncap of an intact tunnel: juveniles were occasionally seen digging up spider tunnels already used, a behavior not \nobserved in adults (T. Falótico, personal observation).\nThe same is somehow true for Thiloa  USOs, which are not present in every root, making the search more \nchallenging than Ocotea roots. On the other hand, these USOs are also dug and eaten by peccaries, so sites dug \nby them could be used as a hint of USOs locations. These characteristics appear to make spiders the most difficult \nresource to locate, followed by the USOs, which relates to the different success rates of juveniles and adults. Roots \nand USOs have been considered fallback food for capuchin monkeys in this area\n22, but the present data do not \nsupport this claim.\nThe use of stones as “hoes” (DSTh) was infrequent, as compared to that of the DSTs used only as “hammers” . \nOnly 14 individuals out of 61 performed both behaviors. Individuals in both groups used stones as DSThs, and \nalthough we have registered a small number of events, it appears to be habitual in the groups.\nThe difference in the frequency of digging stone tool use between the groups studied in SCNP could be due \nto environmental or seasonal differences, or to missing observations of episodes happening at the same time, a \nsampling issue in larger groups. PF and BC groups (this study) and Jurubeba group\n7 were 3 to 4 times larger than \nthe 10 individuals group reported by Moura and Lee21, making missing observations of episodes happening at the \nsame time more likely for the larger groups. Ecology is not a likely explanation (although we cannot discard it), \nsince both areas are just 15 km apart, but inter-annual seasonality could account for some variation in the overall \navailability of food items obtained using stone tools, since data were collected in different years, and this region \nhas great inter-annual rain variation\n31, a factor that could affect plant productivity.\nThe difference in success rate of DST use could be due to distinct inter-annual availability of the more easily \nobtained underground food items, such as roots (as compared to USOs or spiders). Unfortunately, neither of \nthose previous studies presented data separated by resources consumed. Although we could not compare the \nfood consumption frequencies for each resource with those studies, some of the consumed items are the same, \nlike T. glaucocarpa\n23 while others were not observed being consumed in the present study - Combretum sp and \nAstronium sp7. Both previous studies reported digging of insects’ nests, but there is no mention of spiders. Again, \nthis could be due to a difference in their availability between the areas or to the misidentification of spider tunnels \nas insect´s nests.\nWe found no negative correlations between plant and arthropods’ availability and digging tools’ use frequency, \nas predicted by the “necessity hypothesis” . On the contrary, we found a significant positive correlation between \nDST use and plant matter availability, similarly to what was found for the nut cracking tools’ use in another S . \nlibidinosus population28, making the lack of preferred food an unlikely factor to predict the occurrence of stone \ntools’ use. These results are also similar to those on chimpanzees’ USOs consumption and tool use14. For capuchin \nnut cracking, the nuts were considered a staple fallback food28, while the present underground resources would \nbe more precisely described as a filler fallback food (a resource that never fills up the whole diet, is not consumed \nduring part of the season and is patchily distributed). An alternative, non-exclusive, hypothesis tested and sup-\nported in other population studied - but not, so far, in SCNP - is the “opportunity hypothesis”\n28. It proposes that \ntool use to access encased food is invented and maintained by repeated exposure to appropriate ecological condi-\ntions, such as the presence of the resource that needs tools to be consumed and the tool materials\n28, 35.\nThe use of stone tools for digging is present in all the studied groups in the SCNP population. Its appar -\nent absence in other tool-using capuchin monkey populations36 could be explained by distinct social traditions, \nsince ecological and genetic differences are apparently small. The “opportunity hypotheses” could also explain \nthe situation, because both the resource to be processed and  the adequate lithic material have to be available. \nThe abundance of stone material, high in SCNP , could facilitate the innovative use of stones as tools for several  \npurposes\n1, 7, 24, 25, 37.\nThe hypothesis could be used as a complementary explanation for the variation of stone tool use or any \nobject manipulation behaviors in other non-human primates. Groups that use the same kind of object but live \nin areas with different availability of proper material would present a positively correlated variation in tool use \ndiversity.\nReferences\n 1.
