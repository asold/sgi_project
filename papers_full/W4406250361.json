    "abstract": "The administrative burden of manually extracting clinical information from discharge letters is a common challenge in healthcare. This study aims to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) by OpenAI, for automated extraction of diagnoses, medications, and allergies from discharge letters. Data for this study were sourced from two healthcare institutions in Germany, comprising discharge letters for ten patients from each institution. The first experiment is conducted using a standardized prompt for information extraction. However, challenges were encountered, and the prompt was fine-tuned in a second experiment to improve the results. We further tested whether open-source LLMs can achieve similar results. In the first experiment, primary diagnoses were identified with 85% accuracy and secondary diagnoses with 55.8%. Medications and allergies were extracted with 85.9% and 100% accuracy, respectively. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes for the identified diagnoses achieved an accuracy of 85% for primary diagnoses and 60.7% for secondary diagnoses. Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes were identified with an accuracy of 78.8%. On the other hand, open-source LLMs did not provide similar levels of accuracy and could not consistently fill the template. With prompt fine-tuning in the second experiment, the primary diagnoses, secondary diagnoses, and medications could be predicted with 95%, 88.9%, and 92.2% accuracy, respectively. GPT-4 shows excellent potential for automated extraction of crucial diagnostic and medication information from discharge letters, presumably lowering the administrative burden for healthcare professionals and improving patient outcomes.",
