  "abstract": "Background As health care continues to evolve with technological advancements, the integration of artificial intelligence into clinical practices has shown promising potential to enhance patient care and operational efficiency. Among the forefront of these innovations are large language models (LLMs), a subset of artificial intelligence designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language at an unprecedented scale. Objective This systematic review describes the role of LLMs in improving diagnostic accuracy, automating documentation, and advancing specialist education and patient engagement within the field of gastroenterology and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Methods Core databases including MEDLINE through PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central registry were searched using keywords related to LLMs (from inception to April 2024). Studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) any type of studies that investigated the potential role of LLMs in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy or gastroenterology, (2) studies published in English, and (3) studies in full-text format. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that did not report the potential role of LLMs in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy or gastroenterology, (2) case reports and review papers, (3) ineligible research objects (eg, animals or basic research), and (4) insufficient data regarding the potential role of LLMs. Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies—of Interventions was used to evaluate the quality of the identified studies. Results Overall, 21 studies on the potential role of LLMs in gastrointestinal disorders were included in the systematic review, and narrative synthesis was done because of heterogeneity in the specified aims and methodology in each included study. The overall risk of bias was low in 5 studies and moderate in 16 studies. The ability of LLMs to spread general medical information, offer advice for consultations, generate procedure reports automatically, or draw conclusions about the presumptive diagnosis of complex medical illnesses was demonstrated by the systematic review. Despite promising benefits, such as increased efficiency and improved patient outcomes, challenges related to data privacy, accuracy, and interdisciplinary collaboration remain. Conclusions We highlight the importance of navigating these challenges to fully leverage LLMs in transforming gastrointestinal endoscopy practices.
