INTRODUCTION\nHot spot temperature (HST) is deﬁned as the maximum\ntemperature point of the transformer’s winding, and the dete-\nrioration of transformer oil-paper insulation is signiﬁcantly\naffected by the HST. It is widely accepted that the ageing\nrate of paper insulation doubles each 6 K rise above the rated\nHST 371 K (98 ◦C) [1]. Therefore, accurate prediction of\ntransformer’s HST is of great signiﬁcance.\nThere are many ways to detect HST. Optical ﬁber tem-\nperature sensors can be installed inside the transformer to\nmeasure the HST directly [2]–[4], however, due to the high\ncost of the optical ﬁber instrument, it cannot ﬁt the demand\nof large-scale application, and it cannot be applied to the in-\nservice transformer. Besides, because of the uncertainty of\nthe speciﬁc hot spot location, it is hard to get the accurate\ntemperature of the hot spot. Considering the analogy between\nelectrical and heat-transfer phenomena, many classical ther-\nmal circuits are proposed to calculated the temperature of\nhot spot [5]–[7]. Based on thermal circuit, corresponding\nempirical formula is also proposed to detect HST in IEC and\nIEEE standards [7], [8]. However, the key parameters such as\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was aysegul Ucar.\nheat capacity and thermal resistance in the thermal circuit is\ndifﬁcult to obtain.\nWith the development of numerical calculation, the\nelectromagnetic-ﬂuid-thermal coupled method has been used\nin transformer HST detection. Finite element method (FEM)\ncan be used to calculate the losses inside the windings and\niron structure, and ﬁnite volume method (FVM) can be used\nto calculate the ﬂuid-thermal distribution inside the trans-\nformer [9]. Numerical method can reﬂect the temperature and\noil ﬂow velocity distribution inside the transformer with a\nhigh accuracy. However, due to the complex structure and\nmaterial nonlinearity of transformer, numerical method has a\nhigh requirement for computer performance and it often takes\nmuch computing time.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence algorithms have also been applied\nto predict the HST inside the transformer, and they have\nperformed a good performance. Artiﬁcial neural network was\nused to predict the top-oil temperature of a 22.4 MV A oil-\nimmersed transformer [10]. The particle swarm optimizer\nwas used to identify the thermal parameters of a simpliﬁed\nthermoelectric analogous thermal model in a large autotrans-\nformer (220 MV A, 400.0kV/132.0kV , ONAN/OFAF) [11].\nSupport vector regression machine with an improved particle\n107380 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Denget al.: Method for HST Prediction of a 10-kV Oil-Immersed Transformer\nswarm optimization (PSO) method has been adopted to estab-\nlish a model for the prediction of HST in a 750MV A/500kV\npower transformer, this model has achieved a good predic-\ntion results and it is veriﬁed by the real datasets sampled\nfrom the transformer [12]. An algorithm combining support\nvector regression and information granulation was proposed\nto detect the hot spot temperature of a 15 MV A ODAF\ntransformer, and it outperforms a number of existing thermal\nmodel based methods, namely IEEE model, Swift’s model\nand Susa’s model [13]. Based on the support vector regression\noptimized by genetic algorithm (GA), the performances of\nthree commonly used models (IEEE model, Swift’s model\nand Susa’s model) for predicting transformer top oil temper-\nature are compared in [14].\nThe internal relation between the HST and the temperature\non the transformer iron shell and the load rate can be viewed\nas a complicated multi-dimensional nonlinear relationship.\nBased on this view, in this paper, according to the results\nof coupled multi-physical ﬁeld computation, a set of feature\ntemperature points on the transformer iron shell is proposed.\nTaking the load rate and the feature temperature points into\nconsideration, we developed a mathematical model based on\nSVR to predict the HST of the transformer. The orthogonal\ndesign method is used in this paper to choose appropriate\ntraining samples. The validity of the proposed methodology\nis validated by transformer temperature rise test.\nII. A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREDICTION\nMETHOD\nA. BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF SVR\nSVR has a strong ability in dealing with multi-dimensional\nnon-linear problems with relatively few samples [15]. A brief\nintroduction of ε-SVR can be described as follows [16]–[18]:\nA set of training samples S can be expressed in (1), where\nxi is the ith input vector, yi is the corresponding output vector\nand n is the sample size.\nS ={(x1,y1),··· ,(xn,yn)}⊂Rn ×R (1)\nA hyperplane can be applied to characterizing the relation-\nship between x and y, namely f (x) =ω·x+b, where ω∈Rn\nand b ∈R.\n|yi −f (xi)|≤ε, i =1,2,··· ,n (2)\nFor any point (x i, yi) in the training sample set, the distance\nto the hyperplane di can be expressed as:\ndi =|ω ·xi +b −yi|\n√\n1+∥ω∥2 ≤ ε√\n1+∥ω∥2 , i =1,2,··· ,n (3)\nThere may be several hyperplanes can satisfying the\nrequirements of (3), the optimal hyperplane should maximize\nthe distance between the training sample set and the hyper-\nplane, namely:\n\n\n\nmin ϕ(ω) =1\n2 ∥ω∥2\ns.t. |ω ·xi +b −yi|≤ε, i =1,2,··· ,n\n(4)\nSlack variables ξi and ξ∗\ni can be introduced to optimize the\nhyperplane:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmin ϕ(ω) =1\n2 ∥ω∥2 +C\nn∑\ni=1\n(\nξi +ξ∗\ni\n)\ns.t. f (xi) −yi ≤ξ∗\ni +ε\nyi −f (xi) ≤ξi +ε\nξi,ξ∗\ni ≥0, i =1,2,··· ,n\n(5)\nwhere C is the penalty factor, ε is the insensitive loss\ncoefﬁcient.\nBy introducing the lagrangian multipliers αi and α∗\ni and γi,\nthe lagrange function of (5) is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL =1\n2∥ω∥2 +C\nn∑\ni=1\n(\nξi +ξ∗\ni\n)\n−\nn∑\ni=1\nαi [ξi +ε−yi +w ·xi +b]\n−\nn∑\ni=1\nα∗\ni\n[\nξ∗\ni +ε+yi −w ·xi −b\n]\n−\nn∑\ni=1\nγi\n(\nξi +ξ∗\ni\n)\ns.t. αi, α∗\ni , γi ≥0, i =1,2,··· ,n\n(6)\nIf the extremum of function L exists, the partial derivatives\nof L with respect to ω, b, ξi and ξ∗\ni are all 0, it can be derived\nthat:\nω =\nn∑\ni=1\n(\nαi −α∗\ni\n)\nxi,\nn∑\ni=1\n(\nαi −α∗\ni\n)\n=0,\nC −αi −γi =0, C −α∗\ni −γ∗\ni =0, i =1,2,··· ,n (7)\nSubstituting (7) into (6), and import the kernel function\nto transform the training sample data from the original input\nspace to a higher-dimensional feature space, the dual problem\nof ε-SVR can be deduced as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax W (α,α∗) =1\n2\nn∑\ni=1\n(\nαi −α∗\ni\n)(\nαj −α∗\nj\n)\nK(xi ·xj)\n+\nn∑\ni=1\n(\nαi −α∗\ni\n)\nyi −\nn∑\ni=1\n(\nαi +α∗\ni\n)\nε\ns.t.\nn∑\ni=1\n(\nαi−α∗\ni\n)\n=0, 0 ≤αi,α∗\ni ≤C, i=1,2,··· ,n\n(8)\nwhere K(xi, xj) =ϕ(xi)T ϕ(xj) is the kernel function.\nThe parameter of the radial basis function (RBF) kernel\nfunction is simple and it can effectively realize a non-linear\nmapping. Thus RBF kernel is selected in this paper, it can be\nexpressed as:\nK(xi,x) =exp(−γ∥x −xi∥2), γ > 0 (9)\nBy solving the above equations, the expression of the\noptimal hyperplane of the corresponding sample training set\nis:\nf (x) =\nn∑\ni=1\n(\nαi −α∗\ni\n)\nK(xi,x) +b (10)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 107381\nY.

TRANSFORMER MULTI-PHYSICAL FIELD ANALYSIS\n1) ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD\nAccording to Maxwell equations, the governing equation of\nquasi-static magnetic ﬁeld problem based on magnetic vector\npotential is shown as follows [9]:\n∇× 1\nµ(∇×A)=Js −σ∂A\n∂t (11)\nwhere µis the magnetic permeability, σis the conductivity, A\nis the magnetic vector potential, and Js is the current density\nvector.\n2) FLUID-THERMAL FIELD\nThe transformer internal oil ﬂow can be described by the mass\nconservation equation, momentum conservation equation and\nenergy conservation equation [20]. To solve the thermal-ﬂuid\nﬁeld coupled equations, the commercial ﬁnite volume CFD\ncode Ansys-CFX V15.0 is used.\n∇·v =0 (12)\nρDv\nDt =ρg −∂p\n∂x +µ∇2v (13)\nρcv ·∇T =∇· k∇T +q (14)\nwhere, ρ is the oil density; v is the ﬂuid velocity; g\nstands for the gravity acceleration; p represents the pressure;\nµ denotes the dynamic viscosity; k is the thermal conduc-\ntivity; c is the speciﬁc heat capacity; T represents the tem-\nperature; q indicates the heat source per volume inside the\ntransformer.\nThe external heat dissipation mainly depends on the heat\nconvection along the surfaces of the transformer. Heat ﬂux q\ninduced by external convection can be described by (15):\nq =hS(T −Tf ) (15)\nwhere, q is the heat ﬂux per unit area, W/m 2; T and Tf is\nthe temperature of the wall and external ﬂuids respectively;\nS is the surface area of the wall; h is the heat convection\ncoefﬁcient.\nHeat convection coefﬁcient h can be obtained from follow-\ning equation [21]:\nNu =aRb\na =hL\nk (16)\nwhere, Nu is the Nusselt number; Ra is the Rayleigh number;\na and b are constants determined by the system; L is the\nfeature size;k is the thermal conductivity.\nAccording to heat-transfer theory [22], [23], the Nusselt\nnumber of vertical plane Nuv and horizontal plane Nuh can\nbe analyzed by the following equations:\nNuv =0.59Ra1/4 (17)\nNuh =0.27Ra1/4 (18)\nTABLE 1. Thermodynamic parameters of the transformer oil.\nFIGURE 1. S13-M-100 kVA/10 kV transformer.\nThe thermal parameter characteristics of the transformer\noil are speciﬁed on Table 1, all parameters vary with the\ntemperature to get a better simulation accuracy [24], [25].\n3) ORTHOGONAL DESIGN METHOD\nSince the temperatures of the training samples are obtained\nby coupled multi-physical ﬁeld calculation, there should be a\nreasonable sampling method to ensure the prediction accu-\nracy of the model and reduce simulation work simultane-\nously. Hence, the orthogonal design method is used in this\npaper to choose appropriate training samples.\nOrthogonal design method is a scientiﬁc method for\narranging and analyzing multi-factor tests, it was ﬁrst pro-\nposed by Taguchi et al. [26]. Orthogonal design method is\nused for two purposes in experimental design, the ﬁrst one\nis to minimize the number of tests, and the second one is to\nget the best results on the basis of fewer tests. By selecting\nsamples uniformly and orderly, orthogonal design method\nis useful and efﬁcient to solve experimental problems with\nmultiple factors and levels [27].\nOrthogonal arrays can be expressed as La(bc), where a is\nthe total number of test runs, b is the number of levels of\neach factor, and c is the number of inﬂuencing factor of the\ntests. In this paper, the orthogonal design method is applied\nto select training samples used for the SVR prediction model.\nThere are four factors including the transformer load rate,\nambient temperature, wind speed and humidity. Each factor\nhas three levels. Hence, a L9(34) orthogonal array is used to\nselect training samples in this paper.\nIII. TRANSFORMER TEMPERATURE RISE TEST AND\nMULTI-PHYSICAL FIELD ANALYSIS\nA. TRANSFORMER TEMPERATURE RISE TEST\nIn this paper, a S13-M-100 kV A/10 kV transformer is selected\nas the research object, the basic parameters of the transformer\nare shown in Table 2, and the structure of the transformer\nis shown in Fig. 1. The transformer temperature rise test is\n107382 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY. Denget al.: Method for HST Prediction of a 10-kV Oil-Immersed Transformer\nTABLE 2. Basic parameters of the transformer.\nFIGURE 2. Optical fiber temperature sensor.\nFIGURE 3. Optical fiber temperature sensors arrangement in temperature\nrise test.\nconducted by short circuit method, during the temperature\nrise test, thermal resistance temperature sensors are used to\nmeasure the temperature rise on the transformer iron shell,\nand optical ﬁber temperature sensors are used to measure\nthe temperature in the winding of the transformer to validate\nthe feasibility and accuracy of the proposed 3-D coupled\nmagneto-ﬂuid-thermal simulation method.\nThe FTM-6CH-H220 optical ﬁber temperature sensor used\nin the test has a temperature measurement range from −40 ◦C\nto 200 ◦C. Two optical ﬁber temperature sensors are installed\nin each phase low voltage winding and high voltage wind-\ning respectively, the structure of the optical ﬁber is shown\nin Fig. 2, and the installation position of the optical ﬁber\nis shown in Fig. 3. The installation position of the thermal\nresistance temperature sensors on transformer iron shell is\nshown in Fig. 4.\nB. TRANSFORMER MULTI-PHYSICAL FIELD ANALYSIS\nUnder normal operating conditions, the total transformer\nlosses including iron loss, winding copper loss and stray loss.\nBefore the temperature rise test, the no-load loss and load\nloss of the transformer are obtained through no-load test and\nload test of the transformer under rated load condition, and\nFIGURE 4. Thermal resistance temperature sensors arrangement in\ntemperature rise test.\nthe value is 149.2W and 1517.3W respectively. It can be\nconsidered that the value of iron loss and no-load loss of\nthe transformer are basically the same, and load losses are\nmainly consists of transformer winding loss and stray loss\non the transformer iron shell. The stray loss on transformer\niron shell is calculated by ﬁnite element method (FEM), and\nthe speciﬁc value is 11.9 W, thus the loss on transformer\nwindings is 1505.4W. Therefore, the winding loss accounts\nfor the majority of the total loss, stray loss on transformer\niron shell accounts for a small part.\nThe temperature rise test of the transformer is carried out\nby the short circuit method, during the test, the total losses\nloaded on the transformer is the sum of the load loss and no-\nload loss of the transformer, and the total loss value under\nrated condition is 1666.5W. As the iron loss on transformer\ncore is very small in the short circuit temperature rise test\nmethod, and the calculated stray loss on the transformer iron\nshell takes a very small proportion of the total loss, less than\n0.75%, thus it can be considered that almost all the losses in\nthe temperature rise test are loaded on transformer windings.\nBased on this, all heat sources are loaded on the transformer\nwindings in the thermal-ﬂuid ﬁeld analysis.\nThe formula for calculating transformer losses under dif-\nferent load rate is as follows:\nP =n2 ×Pl +Pw (19)\nwhere n is the transformer load rate; Pl is the load loss at rated\nload rate; Pw is the no-load loss at rated load rate.\nA three-dimensional transformer simulation model includ-\ning high and low voltage windings, iron core, oil tank and\nradiator structure is established in the analysis. In order to\nobtain grid with a high quality, hexahedral mesh mapping\npartition is used to partition transformer windings, and tetra-\nhedral mesh is used to partition irregular parts of the trans-\nformer, such as the ﬂuid domain of transformer oil, the iron\ncore inside the transformer, the oil tank and radiator shell. The\nmeshes of the model are shown in Fig. 5, and the total mesh\nnumber of the model is 2.53 million.\nThe measured and calculated temperature comparison\nunder different load rate is shown in Table 3, and the calcu-\nlated temperature distribution of the transformer at ratio 1.0 is\nshown in Fig. 6.

FEATURE TEMPERATURE POINTS ON TRANSFORMER\nIRON SHELL\nTransformer oil stream line reﬂects the ﬂow path of trans-\nformer oil. According to the calculation results of transformer\ncoupled multi-physical ﬁeld analysis, main stream lines ﬂow-\ning through transformer oil tank and windings are extracted,\nand they are shown in Fig. 7. The main stream lines ﬂowing\nout from the hot area of windings can be divided into two\ncategories, one is cooled by the wide side radiator of the\nshell and then ﬂow into the bottom of the tank, the other\nis cooled by the narrow side radiator of the shell and then\nﬂow into the bottom of the tank. Based on this phenomenon,\nsix temperature points of transformer iron shell are selected\nas the feature temperature points, these points are shown\nin Fig. 8, and the speciﬁc positions are shown in Table 4.\nFIGURE 7.

SELECTION OF TRAINING AND TEST SAMPLES\nThe method proposed in this paper for HST prediction is\nbased on coupled multi-physical ﬁeld analysis and SVR.\nThe input in the SVR model is a set of feature temperature\npoints on the transformer iron shell and transformer load rate,\nthe output of the model is the HST inside the transformer.\nOnce the relationship is established, we only need to monitor\nthe transformer load rate and temperature on the feature\ntemperature points to get the HST of the transformer.\nThe relationship between the output and input is obtained\nby training sample learning. Therefore, the selection of train-\ning samples directly affects the accuracy of the algorithm.\nTransformer load rate, ambient temperature, wind speed and\n107384 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY.

Four factors and three levels orthogonal table (training\nsamples).\nhumidity can inﬂuence the temperature distribution on trans-\nformer iron shell signiﬁcantly. In order to improve the gen-\neralization performance of the prediction model, the training\nsamples should contain as many transformer operating con-\nditions as possible. The proposed L9(34) orthogonal array is\nshown in Table 5, and speciﬁc training samples are shown\nin Table 6.\nTest samples are used to verify the universality and exten-\nsibility of the model in other situations. The test samples\nselected in this paper are shown in Table 7, in which samples\n1 to 12 are actual transformer temperature rise test results,\nand samples 13 to 20 are the simulation results.\nB. MODEL TRAINING AND PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION\nThrough the analysis of SVR model with RBF kernel, we can\nsee that penalty coefﬁcient C and kernel function parameter\nγ determine the model generalization ability. In this paper,\nbased on the idea of K-fold cross-validation, the grid search\n(GS) method is used to ﬁnd the optimal parameters of C\nand γ. As for the K-fold cross-validation, the original data\nis divided into K groups, among which K-1 groups are used\nas training samples and the remaining one group is used as the\ntest sample for each testing. In this paper, for the 9 training\nsamples, K is set as 9. This procedure was carried out repeat-\nedly for 9 times. The average value of the mean square error\nTABLE 7. Test samples.\n(MSE) for the 9 trials was taken as the performance indicator\nof the SVR model.\nThe features in the model include the transformer load\nrate and the temperatures on the feature temperature points.\nIn order to eliminate the effects of different orders of mag-\nnitude and dimensions, these features are normalized within\nthe range [0, 1] by the following formula [28]:\nx′\ni = xi −xmin\nxmax −xmin\n(20)\nwhere xi is the ith feature, xmin and xmax are its minimum and\nmaximum values and x′\ni is its normalized value.\nC. ERROR ANALYSIS METHOD\nError analysis is one of the important steps to test the HST\nprediction model of oil-immersed transformer. Through error\nanalysis, the advantages and disadvantages of the model\nalgorithm can be evaluated scientiﬁcally, and the reasonable\napplication of the model can be guided.\nIn this paper, four error indexes are used to compare the\npredicted and experimental values [29], namely:\n1) Sum of squared error, SSE\neSSE =\nN∑\ni=1\n(Ai −Pi)2 (21)\n2) Root mean squared error, RMSE\neRMSE =\n√\n1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n(Ai −Pi)2 (22)\n3) Mean absolute percentage error, MAPE\neMAPE =1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n⏐\n⏐⏐⏐\nAi −Pi\nAi\n⏐\n⏐⏐⏐ (23)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 107385\nY.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe optimization results of kernel function parameters and\npenalty coefﬁcient of corresponding training samples under\nGS algorithm are shown in Table 8.\nBased on the optimal parameters obtained by the training\nsamples, the GS optimized SVR model is used to predict the\nHST in the test samples. As the test samples is consisted\nof actual transformer temperature rise results and simula-\ntion results, the predicted values are compared with HST\nmeasured value and simulation value respectively, which are\nshown in Table 9 and Table 10.\nIn order to verify the superiority of the HST predic-\ntion method for S13-M-100 kV A/10 kV oil-immersed trans-\nformer, in this section, the recommended empirical formula\nby IEC are used to calculate the steady-state HST of the\ntest samples, the empirical formula can be described as\nfollows [1]:\nWhen the HST rises:\nθh(t)=θa +1θoi +\n{\n1θor ×\n[1 +RK2\n1 +R\n]x\n−1θoi\n}\n×f1(t)\n+1θhi +\n{\nHgr Ky −1θhi\n}\n×f2(t) (25)\nWhen the HST falls:\nθh(t) =θa +1θor ×\n[1 +RK2\n1 +R\n]x\n+\n{\n1θoi −1θor×\n[1 +RK2\n1 +R\n]x }\n×f3(t)+Hgr Ky (26)\nTABLE 10.

Denget al.: Method for HST Prediction of a 10-kV Oil-Immersed Transformer\ndifference is less than 3 ◦C. The temperature difference calcu-\nlated by empirical formula is much larger than GS-SVR, and\nin some cases it is even more than 15 ◦C. In fact, the wind\nspeed and humidity can directly affect the heat exchange\nefﬁciency between the transformer iron oil tank and the\nenvironment. The greater the wind speed, the better the con-\nvective heat transfer effect between the air and transformer\niron shell. Therefore, the transformer will have a lower hot\nspot temperature at a higher external wind speed. When the\nhumidity is high in the external environment, the thermal\nconductivity of the air will become larger, thus it can also\nenhances the convective heat transfer effect between the air\nand transformer iron shell. Ultimately, the transformer will\nalso have a lower hot spot temperature. As for the empiri-\ncal formula for calculating transformer hot-spot temperature\nrecommended in IEC standard, the hot spot temperature of\nthe transformer is mainly determined by ambient temperature\nand load rate, the effects of ambient wind speed and humidity\ncannot be considered. Therefore, the hot spot temperature\ncalculation error of the empirical formula is large when the\nambient wind speed is high.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nBased on the feature temperature points and SVR, this paper\nhas proposed a novel mathematical model to predict the\nhot spot temperature of a 10 kV oil-immersed distribution\ntransformer. The model is trained by nine samples randomly\nselected according to the orthogonal design method. The\ntrained SVR model is able to predict the HST of 20 test\nsamples including 12 of test results and 8 of simulation\nresults, the mean absolute percentage error of the 20 test\nsamples is only 1.55 %. The SVR model proposed in this\npaper outperforms the empirical formula recommended in\nIEC standard.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to appreciate the test support provided\nby China Shandong Huineng electric Company Ltd.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Power Transformers—Part 7: Loading Guide for Oil-Immersed Power\nTransformers, document IEC 60076-7, 2005.\n[2] J.
