The effects of\nimplementation of a screening method on haloperidol use is not\nknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the\nimplementation of the confus ion assessment method-ICU\n(CAM-ICU) and the effect of its use on frequency and duration\nof haloperidol use.\nMethods We used a tailored implementation strategy focused\non potential barriers. We measured CAM-ICU compliance,\ninterrater reliability, and delirium knowledge, and compared the\nhaloperidol use, as a proxy for delirium incidence, before and\nafter the implementation of the CAM-ICU.\nResults Compliance and delirium knowledge increased from\n77% to 92% and from 6.2 to 7.4, respectively (both, P <\n0.0001). The interrater reliability increased from 0.78 to 0.89.\nMore patients were treated with haloperidol (9.9% to 14.8%, P\n< 0.001), however with a lower dose (18 to 6 mg, P = 0.01) and\nfor a shorter time period (5 [IQR:2–9] to 3 [IQR:1–5] days, P =\n0.02).\nConclusions With a tailored implementation strategy, a delirium\nassessment tool was successfully introduced in the ICU with the\nmain goals achieved within four months. Early detection of\ndelirium in critically ill patients increases the number of patients\nthat receive treatment with haloperidol, however with a lower\ndose and for a shorter time period.\nIntroduction\nDelirium is a common psychiatric disorder in critically ill\npatients. It has an acute onset and combines cognitive and\nattention defects with a fluctuating consciousness [1]. It is\nassociated with a prolonged in tensive care and hospital stay\nand an increased morbidity and mortality [2-4].\nAlthough there has been increasing interest in delirium in the\npast five years, standard screening of patients in daily practice\nis still not common, resulting in an underestimation of the prob-\nlem. Previous studies showed that, without the use of a\nscreening instrument, more than 60% of patients with delirium\nare missed by ICU nurses and more than 70% by physicians\n[5,6]. It can therefore be assumed that delirious patients are\nnot sufficiently treated if they are not recognized. The inci-\ndence rate in critically ill patients varies between 11% and\n87%, depending on the study design, methods for assess-\nment, and differences in population [2,4,7-9].\nAlthough there is no evidence that the use of a delirium\nassessment tool results in improvement of outcome, early rec-\nognition of delirium is importan t for adequate and early treat-\nAPACHE-II: acute physiology and chronic health evaluation-II; CAM-ICU: confusion assessment method-intensive care unit; CI: confidence interval; \nICDSC: intensive care delirium screening checklist; IQR: inter quartile range.\nCritical Care    Vol 13 No 4    van den Boogaard et al.\nPage 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nment. Therefore routine screening of patients is necessary. In\naddition, because of the fluctuating clinical signs and symp-\ntoms of delirium, screening should be performed at least once\nevery 8 to 12 hours [10,11]. A delirium assessment tool\nshould therefore be quick and easy to use with a high interrater\nreliability.\nThe Dutch guidelines Delirium in the Intensive Care recom-\nmends the screening of all ICU patients with a reliable and val-\nidated delirium screening instrument (van Eijk MJJ, Spronk PE,\nvan den Boogaard MHWA, Kuiper MA, Smit EGM, Slooter\nAJC. Delirium op de Intensive Care, unpublished data), such\nas the intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC)\n[12] or the confusion assessment method-ICU (CAM-ICU)\n[13].\nThe treatment of delirium is based on removing the underlying\nsomatic disorder frequently combined with pharmacological\ntherapy. Although there is no clear evidence that treatment\nimproves the prognosis of deli rious ICU patients [14], and\nhaloperidol has significant side effects [15,16], haloperidol is\nthe most commonly recommended pharmacological agent\n[17]. As screening will probably increase the number of\npatients diagnosed with delirium, it could also increase the use\nof haloperidol. In view of this, it is important to determine the\neffect of the implementation of a screening instrument on the\nuse of haloperidol.\nThe first aim of our study was to  evaluate our strategy for the\nimplementation of the CAM-ICU. Therefore, the compliance\nwith scoring of the CAM-ICU, the interrater reliability, and\nimprovement in delirium knowledge of the nurses were used\nas indicators for successful implementation. We assumed that\na larger number of delirious patients would be detected with\nthe use of the CAM-ICU, in comparison with previous periods\nwithout the standard use of a screening tool. The second aim\nof our study was therefore to assess how the CAM-ICU influ-\nences the frequency and duration of haloperidol use, which\nmay be considered to be a proxy for the delirium incidence and\nduration.\nMaterials and methods\nThis study was conducted in the Radboud University\nNijmegen Medical Centre, the Netherlands, a 960-bed univer-\nsity hospital that includes a level 3 (highest level) ICU with 40\nbeds divided over four adult wards and one paediatric ward.\nAnnually 2000 to 2500 (cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgical,\nmedical, surgical, and trauma) patients are admitted.\nThe local Institutional Review Board of Arnhem-Nijmegen indi-\ncated that for this study no approval was required and no\ninformed consent from patients was needed.\nNurses and the implementation of the CAM-ICU\nAlthough the ICDSC and the CAM-ICU are suitable delirium\nscreening instruments, we preferred to implement the CAM-\nICU above the ICDSC because of the higher sensitivity and\nspecificity, and because the CA M-ICU is translated and vali-\ndated in Dutch [18]. The CAM- I C U  i s  a n  e a s y  t o  p e r f o r m\nassessment tool for ICU nurses, which consists of a two-step\napproach model [13] [see Addition al data file 1]. Before the\nimplementation of the CAM-ICU,  identification of delirious\npatients was based on the judgement of the attending ICU\nphysician, and a delirium screening instrument was not used.\nDue to the potential importance of unrecognised delirium, we\ndecided that this should be changed to a situation where reg-\nular and systematic assessment of delirium was performed by\nICU nurses with specific knowledge of delirium recognition.\nTherefore, we introduced the CAM-ICU as an instrument for\nearly recognition of delirium and started with the implementa-\ntion on all four adult ICU wards in December 2007.\nImplementation of a delirium assessment tool in daily practice\nintroduces an essential change for ICU nurses. As there is no\nsingle best method for implementing an innovation in all set-\ntings [19], it is important to identify potential barriers and facil-\nitators in this particular setti ng. For a good adaptation of a\ndelirium screening instrument it is important to tailor the imple-\nmentation strategy to these facilitators and barriers [20]. Fur-\nthermore, support from the organisation and medical and\nnursing staff participation is im portant for a successful imple-\nmentation [21].\nOur implementation strategy [see Additional data file 2] was\nfocused on potential barriers and facilitators for screening with\nthe CAM-ICU (Table 1), which were identified during several,\nunstructured, interviews with the nursing and medical staff.\nWe integrated the CAM-ICU al gorithm in our patient data\nmanagement system, which is available at all bedside comput-\ners. Because of the fluctuating course of delirium every patient\nhad to be assessed minimally once in every eight-hour shift,\naccording to the CAM-ICU manual [22]. If the mental status\nchanged after an assessment, an  additional assessment had\nto be performed. Patients were excluded from screening when\nthey had a Richmond agitation sedation score of -4 or -5 [13],\nwere unable to understand Dutch, were severely mentally dis-\nabled, or suffered from a serious receptive aphasia. All neces-\nsary testing tools (attention screening pictures and\ndisorganized thinking questions) were made available at every\nbed. The computer notified the nurse about the outcome of the\nCAM-ICU screening, that is, delirious or not.\nEvidence-based interventions [23] included in the implemen-\ntation strategy were: education; educational outreach visits;\nreminders and feedback; and leadership.\nAvailable online http://ccforum.com/content/13/4/R131\nPage 3 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nEducation and educational outreach visits\nAll ICU nurses were trained in  the use of the CAM-ICU and\nperformed a knowledge test prio r to the training. The educa-\ntion consisted of a one-hour group training prior to the imple-\nmentation of the CAM-ICU. Duri ng this training, information\nabout delirium features, recognition, and delirium types was\ngiven. Furthermore, specific information was given about the\nCAM-ICU. We used educational material from the delirium\nwebsite [22] such as the training video and the Harvard CAM-\nICU flow sheet. We appointed 'delirium key-nurses', who\nreceived supplementary training, for further instruction and\nintroduction of the CAM-ICU in their unit. In addition, posters\nwith the Harvard CAM-ICU flow  sheet were distributed to\nnurses and the medical staff. Also, the medical staff was\ninformed about delirium and the CAM-ICU. Supplementary\nindividual training on the job (by MvdB, and the 'delirium key-\nnurses') started one month after the implementation and was\ngiven whenever screening compliance and interrater reliability\ndropped below the stated aim. The focus during this training\non the job was on the most common mismatches, that is fea-\nture 1A and 1B [see Additional data file 1]. Determination of\nthe presence of cognitive function disturbances and the fluc-\ntuating nature of consciousness were the most difficult points\nfor the ICU nurses. Individual problems with the assessment\nwere addressed by focusing the training on the difficulties\nexperienced during observations.\nReminders and feedback\nWhen a delirium assessment was not carried out, a pop-up\nappeared on the bedside computer as a reminder for the\nnurse. The CAM-ICU scoring rate, that is the screening com-\npliance, and the interrater reliability were measured. The\nresults were evaluated with th e delirium key-nurses and the\nnursing staff, twice a week as parameters of a successful\nimplementation. Feedback about results and performance of\nthe CAM-ICU was supplied weekly by e-mail and during\nmonthly clinical meetings.\nLeadership\nThe medical and nursing staff committed themselves to, and\nsupported the implementation of the delirium assessment tool,\nas agreed upon during the information meeting and was\nreported during feedback of the key nurses. One project\nleader was responsible and supervised the implementation\nprocess (MvdB). Prior to the implementation, the CAM-ICU\nwas introduced to the medical staff. Two months after the\nimplementation, the presence of delirium became a standard\npart of the daily multidisciplinary meeting, in which all patients\nare discussed. All ICU wards were visited daily by the project\nleader to identify problems concerning the performance and\ncompliance of the assessment tool and for personal or group\nfeedback.\nChosen indicators of a successful implementation were: regu-\nlar assessment of all ICU patients defined as a screening com-\npliance of more than 80%; interrater reliability score of more\nthan 0.80; and improvement of the level of knowledge con-\ncerning delirium.\nThe compliance was calculated as the percentage of per-\nformed assessments per day of the total number of assess-\nments that should have been performed. Interrater reliability\ntests were performed several times during the first month after\nthe implementation and twice a week during and after the\ntraining on the job period. For this the CAM-ICU score\nassessed by the ICU nurse was compared with the CAM-ICU\nscore assessed by an expert psychiatric nurse (GR). The max-\nimum period between the two assessments was one hour and\npatients were chosen randomly. Patients who were excluded\nfrom screening with the CAM-ICU were also excluded from the\ninterrater reliability testing.\nWe developed a non-validated written delirium knowledge test\nthat had to be completed in 10 minutes prior to the delirium\ntraining and consisted of 10 mixed open and closed ques-\ntions. A similar post-training test was performed four months\nlater. 'Delirium knowledge' is expressed on a scale of 0 to 10.\nThe implementation period started in December 2007 and\nended in March 2008, after rea ching the indicators of care\nimprovement (Figure 1). The nursing staff consists of 140\nnurses of which 18 (13%) were ICU nurses in training.\nThe patients and haloperidol treatment\nAs delirium incidence rates before the use of the assessment\ntool were not available, we us ed the frequency of haloperidol\nuse as a proxy for delirium incidence. Data of all patients who\nwere treated with haloperidol are available through our patient\ndata management system. As a general rule, in our ICU all\nTable 1\nIdentified potential barriers and facilitators during interviews\nImplementation barriers Imp lementation facilitators\n1.

The\nduration of haloperidol treatment was used as a proxy for the\nduration of the delirious period. For the incidence rate of a\nfour-month period (March until June 2008) after the implemen-\ntation, the CAM-ICU results were compared with the haloperi-\ndol use during the same period of the two previous years. We\ncompared the total number of all consecutive patients treated\nwith haloperidol, total days of treatment, and the total dose of\nadministered haloperidol per patient and per day.\nStatistical analyses\nAll data analyses were performed with SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA). Normally distributed data (demographic\ndata, knowledge level, and the scorings rate) were tested par-\nametrically (Student's t-test, repeated measurement analysis\nof variance). Data concerning the treatment with haloperidol\nwere not normally distributed and were tested non-parametri-\ncally with the Friedman test and the Kruskal-Wallis one-way\nanalysis of variance test. Interrater reliability of the outcome of\nscreening, that is delirious or non-delirious, was calculated\nwith the Cohen's Kappa statistic.\nResults\nEvaluation of implementation and nurses\nIn the first month of the implementation period the interrater\nreliability was 0.78 (n = 25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5\nto 1.0) and following intensive training on the job of almost all\nICU nurses this increased to  0.89 (n = 47, 95%CI: 0.75 to\n1.0).\nIn the first month after the implementation the compliance of\nscreening with the CAM-ICU was 77% and increased signifi-\ncantly to 92% (repeated measurement analysis of variance, P\n< 0.0001) after four months. Scoring rate of the nurses at the\npre-course delirium knowledge test was 6.2 ± 1.7 (n = 136)\nand increased significantly to 7.4 ± 1.2 (n = 122) four months\nlater (Student's t-test, P = 0.0001).\nHaloperidol treatment and patients\nWith the exception of a small, but statistically significant differ-\nence in the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II\n(APACHE-II) score, the demographic variables of the patients\ndid not differ between the three years (Table 2). In the same\nperiod in 2006 and 2007, 13 (10%) and 20 (13%) patients\nper month were treated with haloperidol, respectively (Table\n3). Following the implementati on period, based on the CAM-\nICU results, this increased significantly to 37 (23%) patients\nper month ( P < 0.001) compared with the previous period\nwithout the use of the CAM-IC U. All patients who received\nhaloperidol in the period after the implementation in 2008\nwere detected with the CAM-IC U as delirious patients. From\nthese 147 delirious patients, 25 (17%) had a hyperactive type,\n47 (32%) a hypoactive type, an d 74 patients (50.3%) had a\nmixed-type delirium. During this period 641 patients were\nadmitted of which 74 patients were excluded from CAM-ICU\nscreening. The most frequent reason was sustained coma\n(49%). To compare the effect on the detected incidence\nbefore and after the implementation of the CAM-ICU, we used\nthe total of 641 patients, because of the lack of information of\nthe patients in the period before the implementation.\nFigure 1\nImplementation flow chartImplementation flow chart. CAM-ICU = confusion assessment method-intensive care unit.\n\nAvailable online http://ccforum.com/content/13/4/R131\nPage 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nThe median duration of treatment with haloperidol decreased\nfrom five (interquartile range (IQR) 2 to 9) to three days (IQR\n1 to 5) after the implem entation of the CAM-ICU ( P = 0.02).\nThe median total haloperidol do se per patient (during treat-\nment) decreased from 18 mg (IQR 5 to 39.5) to 6 mg (IQR 2\nto 19.5; P = 0.01).\nDiscussion\nIn a relatively short period of  four months, we successfully\nimplemented a validated delirium assessment tool in our daily\npractice on the ICU. Followi ng the implementation of the\nCAM-ICU, more patients were treated with haloperidol, but\nwith a lower dose and for a shorter period of time when com-\npared with the same period in the two previous years. Almost\ntwo times more delirious patients were detected with the use\nof the CAM-ICU. Our results indicate that successful imple-\nmentation of the CAM-ICU is possible and, importantly, that\nthis results in shorter and lower dosed haloperidol treatment.\nThe implementation of the CAM-ICU\nWe feel that several aspects of our implementation strategy\nare responsible for this success. First, we used a multifaceted\nmodel with evidence-based interventions. Although we did not\nmeasure the effect of the separate interventions, previous\nstudies showed that education and feedback with reminders\nare very effective interventions [23]. Second, it is important to\nfocus the implementation strategy on potential barriers that\ncan be expected in daily practice [19], which will differ from\nhospital to hospital and from ward to ward. We therefore gath-\nered information about these potential barriers prior to the\nactual implementation. Based on this information, we used the\nfacilitators of our organization and integrated the CAM-ICU in\nour patient data management system. Although it took some\ntime to develop the integrated CAM-ICU, it was easier to use\nand included a reminder when the assessment had not been\nperformed at the end of the shift. The key-nurses played an\nimportant role in supporting the group and therefore were piv-\notal. They were also particularly helpful in bedside training of\nthe ICU nurses, their direct colleagues.\nTable 2\nDemographic variables of ICU-patients before and after implementation of CAM-ICU\nPeriod Prior to implementation\nMarch to June 2006\nPrior to implementation\nMarch to June 2007\nAfter implementation March to June \n2008\nP value\nNumber of patients 512 589 641\nAge 57.5 ± 16.4 58.9 ± 16.6 59.5 ± 15.6 N.S.\nGender (M/F) 339/173 370/219 409/232 N.S.\nAPACHE-II score 16.9 ± 7.0 17.1 ± 6.9 15.5 ± 6.5 0.0001\nLength of stay on ICU in days (median \n(IQR))\n1.3 (0.8 to 5.9) 1.0 (1 to 5) 1.0 (1 to 3) N.S.\nAdmission type (n)\nElective surgery 214 (42%) 283 (48%) 340 (53%) N.S.\n'Urgent surgery 106 (20%) 96 (16%) 76 (12%)\nMedical 192 (38%) 210 (36%) 225 (35%)\nAll values are means ± standard deviation unless otherwise reported.\nAPACHE II = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II; CAM-ICU = confusion assessment method-intensive care unit; F = female; ICU \n= intensive care unit; IQR = interquartile range; M = male; N.S. = non-significant.\nTable 3\nEffect of the implementation of the CAM-ICU in 2008 on delirium treatment\n2006\n(n = 512)\n2007\n(n = 589)\n2008\n(n = 641)\nP value\nTotal numbers of delirious patients (%) 51 (10%) 79 (13%) 147 (23%) < 0.0001\nNumber of delirious patients per month 13 20 37 < 0.0001\nTotal dose of haloperidol per patient (mg)\nn = total number of patients treated with haloperidol\n18 (5 to 40)\n(n = 52)\n12.5 (3 to 30)\n(n = 80)\n6 (2 to 20)\n(n = 147)\n0.01\nDuration of treatment (days) 5 (2 to 9) 3 (2 to 9) 3 (1 to 5) 0.02\nAll values are medians (interquartile range) unless other reported.

We noticed that it is important that the CAM-ICU score\nis part of the daily evaluation of  the patient and that it is also\nimportant to react adequately to  a positive delirious score by\ntreating the patient. Therefore, it is also important to inform the\nmedical staff during the implem entation (education) and give\nthem regular feedback on the results of the implementation\n(compliance, interrater reliability, and delirium knowledge\nlevel). As these interventions are tailored to the barriers found\nin this study they should not be used as a blueprint for imple-\nmentation but could serve as a guideline.\nAlthough the CAM-ICU appears to be relatively simple to use\nand a relatively short training period should result in a reliable\nperformance of the CAM-ICU [11,13], our study demonstrates\nthat an intensive implementation strategy results in a further\nimprovement of its performance. We aimed for a group inter-\nrater reliability score of at least 0.8, which can be considered\na desirable [24] and attainable goal for the CAM-ICU [13]. Evi-\ndently, it is of utmost importan ce to test the reliability of the\nassessment by the ICU nurses, because a false-positive diag-\nnosis may result in unnecessary treatment and vice versa.\nTherefore, in our view, it is necessary to perform interrater reli-\nability tests and analyse the mismatches to be able to give\nadequate feedback. Unfortunately, and surprisingly, not much\nattention is given to this aspect in the literature and many new\nscreening and treatment policies appear to be implemented\nwithout it.\nAlthough a high interrater reliability is important for the per-\nformance of the CAM-ICU, a screening tool will only be effec-\ntive when the compliance with its use is also high. Although we\ndid not formally measure the nursing workload, it is clear that\nthe screening of patients with  the CAM-ICU results in some\nadditional work for the nurses. Our experience is that the mean\nscreening time of the patients with the CAM-ICU is two to five\nminutes, which is comparable with that mentioned by Ely and\ncolleagues [13]. Based on a study by Soja and colleagues\n[25] we chose an 80% compliance with the CAM-ICU as a\nfeasible and acceptable aim fo r a successful implementation.\nScoring all patients three times a day during their whole stay\non the ICU is hardly realistic. Moreover, an optimal compliance\nis unknown. We are convinced that the intensive feedback and\nsupport of the project leader and the medical and nursing staff\nplayed an important role in achieving a high compliance.\nHaloperidol treatment and patients\nOne could argue that haloperidol use is not a good proxy for\nthe incidence of delirium because it is also used to treat other\ndisorders such as serious psychoses, severe excitement, and\nanxiety [26]. However, these disorders are rarely observed in\nour ICU or not treated with haloperidol. In the case of agitation\nin patients without a protected airway we use a low dose of\npropofol, if necessary in combination with oxazepam. There-\nfore we are confident that in our ICU only delirious patients are\ntreated with haloperidol and th at the observed difference in\nhaloperidol use between the compared treatment periods can\nonly be attributed to differences in delirium detection rate.\nDespite the fact that we found a higher incidence of delirious\npatients with the CAM-ICU than without the use of a screening\ninstrument, the incidence in our population is low. A possible\nexplanation is that the study was performed in all consecutive\npatients, with no selection of high-risk patient groups. Includ-\ning patients that were admitted to our ICU following elective\nsurgery may also partly explain why the APACHE II score is\nlower compared with other studies that reported higher\nAPACHE II scores associated with a higher incidence of delir-\nium [13,27,28].\nIt is assumed that the regular use of a delirium assessment tool\nresults in a higher detection rate of delirious patients, espe-\ncially patients with a hypoactive delirium. Naturally, this could\nresult in more haloperidol use. Given the potential side effects\nof the drug, the absence of clear evidence that presence of\nhypoactive delirium is associat ed with poor patient outcome\nand that the use of a delirium assessment tool improves the\noutcome of the ICU patient, one might argue that an increase\nin haloperidol use is not desirable. On the other hand, an ear-\nlier and improved recognition of delirious patients may make it\neasier to treat the delirium with lower doses of haloperidol. To\nour knowledge, the influence of performing the CAM-ICU on\nthe total amount of haloperidol used per patient has not been\nstudied before. It appears plau sible that, besides the earlier\ndetection of delirious patients, also recovery from the delirious\nperiod could be detected earlier with the use of a delirium\nassessment tool. As a result, haloperidol treatment would be\nstopped earlier. Our data confirm these assumptions. It is also\npossible that the early treatment of delirium could result in\nshortening of the delirious period, but this assumption needs\nfurther study.\nConclusions\nTailoring our implementation strategy to the needs of the ICU\nwas successful. The main goals were achieved within a rela-\ntively short time. Early recognition of delirium with the CAM-\nICU has become a standard component of daily care by the\nnurses in our ICU and contributes to the quality of care. In\naddition, early detection of delirium leads to lower dosage and\nshorter periods of haloperidol treatment in critically ill patients.\nKey messages\n Implementation of the CAM-ICU is feasible and results \nin a higher determination rate of delirium.\n When the CAM-ICU is used, more patients receive \nhaloperidol, but in a lower dose and for a shorter period \nof time.\nAvailable online http://ccforum.com/content/13/4/R131\nPage 7 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nMvdB carried out the study, gathered all data, performed the\nstatistical analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
