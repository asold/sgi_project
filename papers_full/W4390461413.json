This fundamental but \nburdensome process involves repetitive citation screening, a task that is notoriously \ntime-consuming and labor-intensive [1-3]. Recent advancements have seen reports on \nmachine learning applications for citation screening, offering hopes of workload \nreduction [4-9]. However, previous findings from our own research have only shown \ntime savings without achieving satisfactory accuracy. This underscores the necessity \nfor more efficient methods that further refine the accuracy of citation screening [9-11].  \nAmidst growing interest in large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, \nthese advanced artificial intelligence tools, rooted in natural language processing, \nhave shown the potential in performing complicated tasks such as data interpretation \nand text generation [12, 13]. This newly launched technology is a promising candidate \nto transform the whole process of citation screening owing to its capacity of \ngenerating human-like responses based on highly sophisticated comprehension [14, \n15]. As an example of this offer, previous research has suggested the feasibility of \nutilizing GPT-3.5 for citation screening tasks [16]. Yet, there remains a dearth of \nstudies focused on the application of LLMs for extensive citation screening in the \ncontext of developing clinical practice guidelines. \nTherefore, we hypothesize that a large language model may potentially meet the \nquality of manual citation screening and substantially diminish the manual workload. \nThis prospective study will critically compare the accuracy and operational efficiency \nof LLMs with that of conventional manual screening methods, with the aim of setting \na new standard in the creation of clinical practice guidelines.  \n \nMethods \nStudy design and settings \nWe will conduct a prospective study to va lidate the efficacy of LLMs for citation \nscreening. This research will involve several phases: the elaboration of a suitable \nAll rights reserved.

To ensure transparency and \nreproducibility, we have documented our review protocol and disseminated it through \nthe medRxiv pre-print server. Additionally, our study is registered with the University \nHospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) clinical trials registry under the \nidentifier [UMIN000053091], underscoring our commitment to rigorous scientific \nstandards and ethical research practices. \n \nClinical questions in the J-SSCG \nWe will evaluate the efficiency of the large language model using the clinical \nquestions (CQs) in the revised version of J-SSCG 2020, namely J-SSCG 2024, as \ndescribed in the previous report. The Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine \n(JSICM) and the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) created J-SSCG \n2020 and will publish J-SSCG2024, in light of Japanese-specific clinical settings for \nsepsis and septic shock on the clinical practice [19].  \n    The five CQs (Table 1), which we deployed in the previous report, will be used for \nthis study. Briefly, extensive literature reviews were carried out via CENTRAL, \nPubMed, and Ichushi-Web for these CQs, with the working group members ensuring \na comprehensive search strategy that includes all key studies. The literature was \nlimited to Japanese and English. All titles and abstracts were downloaded, collated, \nand deduplicated using EndNote as the citation manager for J-SSCG 2024.  \n \nLarge language model   \nWe will use GPT-4 as a large language model to investigate the efficiency and \nfeasibility for implementing systematic reviews in the development of clinical \npractice guidelines. After importing the dataset from citation managers with the same \nprocedure of the conventional tool for citation screening, we interacted the dataset \nwith OpenAI GPT4 API using pandas (v1.0.5) in Python (v3.9.0).

As of each query, we \nwill follow the exactly same phrases described in the framework of CQs that the J-\nSSCG2024 members of the conventional citation screening created.  \n \nPrompt:  \nYou are conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis, focusing on a specific \narea of medical research. Your task is to evaluate research studies and determine \nwhether they should be included in your review. To do this, each study must meet the \nfollowing criteria: \n \nTarget Patients: ---  \nIntervention: --- \nComparison: ---  \nStudy Design: ---  \nAdditionally, any study protocol that meets these criteria should also be included. \n \nHowever, you should exclude studies in the following cases: \n \nThe study does not meet all of the above eligibility criteria. \nThe study's design is not a randomized controlled trial. Examples of unacceptable \ndesigns include case reports, observational studies, systematic reviews, review articles, \nanimal experiments, letters to editors, and textbooks. \nAfter reading the title and abstract of a study, decide whether to \"include\" or \n\"exclude\" it based on these criteria.  \n \nTitle: --- \nAbstract: --- \n \nAll rights reserved.

According \nto the relevance of the references, GPT-4 will decide to include or exclude each \ncitation without prior knowledge. After the session, we will check the results recorded \non the file. The code for this process will be available at the following link: \nhttps://github.com. \n \nConventional citation screening \nWe will use the same data for the conventional citation screening in the previous data \npublished as a prospective observation study. Briefly, EndNote-processed files was \ntransferred to Rayyan, a systematic review assistant software. Two independent \nreviewers screened the studies by title and abstract, resolving conflicts through \ndiscussion or third-party review.  \n \nData collection \nOur research will compare the accuracy and workload between traditional literature \nscreening methods and those assisted by a large language model. To assess accuracy, \nwe will count the number of missing or redundant references identified by the \nconventional screening as compared to the large language model-assisted process. To \nassess workload, we will record the time taken to citation screening. The reviewers \nwill use a command line to measure the processing time to complete the task. For the \nconventional screening, we will use the previously published data that recorded the \nduration of the screening session using Rayyan's built-in time tracking feature.  \n \nStatistical analysis \nContinuous variables will be reported as means with standard deviations or medians \nwith interquartile ranges, based on their distribution characteristics. The efficacy of \nthe LLM in systematic reviews will be evaluated by comparing its sensitivity and \nspecificity with the conventional method, which will serve as the benchmark for \naccurate citation screening.

To calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive \nvalue in the primary analysis, we will use the second screening results in the \nconventional method as the gold standard to compare the results of the first screening \nperformed by both GPT-4 and the conventional method. The results of the first \nscreening session using the conventional method will serve as the gold standard in the \nsecondary analysis to evaluate the performance of the screening process facilitated by \nGPT-4 in terms of the statistical measures. The duration of systematic review sessions \nfor each clinical question will be collectively analyzed to measure time efficiency. As \na sensitivity analysis, the study will analyze the variations in accuracy attributable to \nthe modifications of the GPT-4 prompts, thereby examining how prompt engineering \ninfluences LLM performance in citation screening tasks. For statistical analysis, the \nGraphPad Prism 10 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) will be used \nto manage the research data and perform statistical tests. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved.
