Introduction \nNatural Language Processing has experienced a significant revolution, the transformer model emerging \nas a pivotal factor in this change. It is a significant transformation in NLP from traditional sequential \nmodels to innovative architectures based on the a ttention. Among this transformation, the transition \nfrom unidirectional model to bidirectional model has been a remarkable development [1-4].  \nUnidirectional models, deeply ingrained in the history of NLP, have been foundational in various \ntext processing tasks over the years. These models operate on the principle of sequential language \nprocessing, adhering to the order in which words or tokens appear in a text. Their versatility has led to \ntheir application in tasks spanning from text classification to machine translation [5 -7]. The \nstraightforward nature of unidirectional models, along with their effectiveness, made them the default \nchoice for many NLP applications. At the core of unidirectional models are recurrent neural networks \n(RNNs) and their variants, such as Long Short -Term Memory networks. These models process input \ndata one token at a time while maintaining a hidden state that carries information from previous tokens \nto influence the processing of the current token [8-9].  \nDespite their historical success, unidirectional models face inherent limitations, particularly when \ndealing with lengthy texts and intricate linguistic dependencies. One of the primary challenges \nProceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning and AutomationDOI: 10.54254/2755-2721/42/20230794\n© 2023 The Authors.

Long texts often involve complex relationships between distant words or phrases, posing \ndifficulties for traditional unidirectional models. The recurrent nature of RNNs and LSTMs hinders their \nability to efficiently handle such dependencies. In contrast, the transformer model has brought a \nrevolutionary solution to these limitations. It introduces self -attention mechanisms and multi -head \nattention, enabling it to perform global modeling of text sequences. By employing self -attention, \ntransformers can simultaneously consider all positions within an input sequence, making them highly \nadept at capturing contextual information and long-range dependencies. \nThis paper mainly focuses on the evolution of transformer models in the NLP, and its emphasis on \nthe transition from unidirectional to bidirectional modeling. We will talk about the various aspects of \ntransformer models which include architecture, pre -training tasks and performance in the NLP tasks. \nThrough this research, we aim to get a comprehensive understanding of the transformer model’s \nevolution and the implications for the field of Natural Language Processing. \n2.  Unidirectional To Bidirectional \n2.1.  Traditional Unidirectional model \nThe traditional unidirectional model is a foundational approach for processing sequences, and it is \nmarked by its linear handling of input data.  Its fundamental characteristic can lie in the sequentiality of \ninput elements in the order of their occurrence. Through this processing, the model can proceed step by \nstep without revisiting or advancing beyond the current input element. \nThe Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is indeed a single -directional model, widely employed \nfor tasks such as image recognition, and its application has extended to other domains like Natural \nLanguage Processing.  \n \nFigure 1. CNN architecture diagram [10]. \nIn the Figure 1, a CNN model designed for image recognition, where the leftmost image represents \nour input layer, interpreted by the computer as a series of matrices. This CNN architecture features \ndistinctive Convolution Layers with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. The ReLU \nactivation function is defined as ReLU(x) = max (0, x). Following the Convol ution Layers, there are \nPooling Layers, another essential element of CNNs. Pooling Layers do not have an activation function. \nThe combination of Convolution Layers and Pooling Layers can be repeated multiple times in the hidden \nlayers, as seen in the diagr am, but the specific number of repetitions depends on the model's \nrequirements. Alternatively, one can use combinations like Convolution Layers followed by \nConvolution Layers or Convolution Layers followed by Convolution Layers and then a Pooling Layer. \nProceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning and AutomationDOI: 10.54254/2755-2721/42/20230794\n282\nThe choice of architecture depends on the specific modeling needs. Following several Convolution and \nPooling Layers, there are Fully Connected Layers. These FC layers serve to connect the extracted \nfeatures from previous layers to the output layer for clas sification or other tasks. In practice, CNN \narchitectures often consist of several Convolution Layers followed by Pooling Layers, as depicted in the \nprovided CNN structure [10].  \nRecurrent Neural Networks can be visualized as a cyclic neural network structure that can pass \ninformation between different time steps (Figure 2). It enables the network to handle sequential data, \nand can capture contextual information within the sequences.  \n \nFigure 2. RNN architecture diagram [7]. \nRecurrent Neural Network consists of artificial neurons and one or more feedback loops. In this \nstructure, xt represents the input layer, ℎt represents the hidden layer with recurrent connections, and yt \nrepresents the output layer. The hidden layer contains a loop, and for better understanding, we can unfold \nthis loop, resulting in the network structure. In the unfolded network structure, the input is a time \nsequence {..., 𝑋𝑡−1, 𝑋𝑡, 𝑋𝑡+1 , ...}, where xt is associated with the number of input layer neurons. \nCorrespondingly, the hidden layer is {...,ℎ𝑡−1, ℎ𝑡, ℎ𝑡+1 , ...}, where ht is associated with the number of \nhidden layer neurons [7]. \nThis structure enables the RNN to effectively process sequential data by allowing it to pass \ninformation between different time steps and capture contextual information within the sequence. The \ninput and hidden layer state at each time step depend on the previous time steps, making RNN a crucial \ntool in fields such as time series analysis, natural language processing, and more. Figure 2 illustrates the \nnetwork structure of an RNN when processing such sequential data, providing us with a clearer visual \nunderstanding. \nThe Long Short -Term Memory algorithm is a special recurrent neural network with a distinctive \nmodel structure. Figure 3 shows the architecture of an LSTM. LSTM's point of distinction from \ntraditional RNNs lies in its output mechanism. In addition to the conventional output, represented as 'h,' \nLSTM introduces an additional pathway that runs vertically through the entire network, known as the \ncell state. It's important to note that the cell state pathway lacks non -linear activation functions, and \nconsists primarily of simple operations like multiplication and addition. The cell state can be passed to \nthe next unit with relatively minimal changes. The brilliance of LSTM lies in its incorporation of various \ngating mechanisms, including the input gate, forget ga te, and output gate. These gates in LSTM allow \nit to control the importance of information from the previous step. They use sigmoid functions that \noutput values between 0 and 1 to decide how much old information to keep and how much new \ninformation to add to the cell state before passing it to the next step. This controlled flow of information \nmakes LSTM well-suited for tasks involving long-term dependencies and memory retention. \nProceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning and AutomationDOI: 10.54254/2755-2721/42/20230794\n283\n \nFigure 3. LSTM architecture diagram [9]. \n2.2.  Challenges of Unidirectional model \n2.2.1.  Challenges in Handling Long-Term Dependencies \nIn certain situations, recent information is sufficient to address a given task effectively. For instance, If \nwe want to predict the last word in the phrase \"the clouds are in the sky,\" the word should be \"sky,\" and \nwe don't need extensive context. In such  cases, the gap between the position to be predicted and the \nrelevant information is relatively close, enabling RNNs to utilize past information. Conversely, there \nare many scenarios demanding more extensive context information. For example, the text \"I grew up in \nFrance … I speak fluent French.\" Recent information suggests that the word to be predicted should \npertain to a language, but to determine the specific language, we need background information like \n\"grew up in France\" from a more distant context. T heoretically, Unidirectional models have the \ncapability to handle such long -term dependencies, but in practice, they often struggle to address this \nissue effectively [8]  \n2.2.2.  Challenges in lack of data \nUnidirectional models face challenges when adapting to multilingual and multidomain tasks. These \nchallenges include a high demand for annotated data, which is necessary to train the model for specific \nlanguages, and it leads to substantial human and time resources. In other words, it means that model will \nspend high costs. Furthermore, the time and computational resources needed for training unidirectional \nmodels for diverse languages, it can pose practical challenges for both researchers and practitioners,  \nespecially when quick responses to different language and domain requirements are needed. These \nmodels lack adaptability and often require time-consuming retraining or fine-tuning for new languages \nor domains, which may not always be feasible or efficient . Additionally, in cases like low -resource \nlanguages or specialized domains, the scarcity of annotated data can severely hinder the application of \nnatural language processing techniques. These challenges underscore the advantages of more versatile \nbidirectional models in handling diverse multilingual and multidomain NLP tasks. \n3.  Bidirectional models \nThis chapter begins by illustrating the fundamental principles of bidirectional models using the basic \ntransformer model as an example. Subsequently, several improved models based on the Transformer are \npresented. \n3.1.  Transformer model  \nThe Transformer model is a deep learning structure that is employed in natural language processing and \nvarious sequence-to-sequence tasks. The core innovation of the Transformer model is the self-attention \nmechanism. This mechanism allows the model to weig h the importance of each word in the sequence \nProceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning and AutomationDOI: 10.54254/2755-2721/42/20230794\n284\nrelative to all other words, thus capturing rich contextual information. In the seminal work titled \n\"Attention Is All You Need,\" it is explained that self-attention functions by allowing every word in the \ninput sequence to focus on each other word, and their individual contributions are carefully amalgamated \nto create an output representation. This innovative method for global modeling represents a significant \ndeparture from traditional sequential models like RNNs and LSTMs, which struggled with handling \nlong range dependencies in text [1]  \nThe innovation of the Transformer lies in its extensive incorporation of the attention mechanism into \nneural network models, and it discarding the conventional LSTM and RNN architectures. Traditional \nsequential models like LSTM and RNN have trouble fully utilizing GPU parallel computing, making \nthem inefficient in terms of time. The authors' innovative idea is to keep the attention mechanism while \ngetting rid of LSTM and RNN structures, focusing on creating an attention model that can work well \nwith parallel computing. One of the significant contributions of this paper is the attention sub-module's \ndesign, with the entire model being a stack of these sub-modules [1]. \nThis model processes the entire input sequence in one go, eliminating the need for step -by-step \nreasoning as in LSTM and RNN, thus fully exploiting GPU parallel computing capabilities. However, \nto compensate for the loss of word positional information, pos ition encoding is introduced. The figure \n4 shows the detail of model. \n \nFigure 4. Transformer model [1]. \n3.2.  The Bidirectional Model Based on Transformer Model \nBuilding upon the self-attention mechanism at the core of the Transformer model, Bidirectional Encoder \nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) represents a groundbreaking development in NLP and an \nembodiment of the power of bidirectional modeling. Traditional unidirectional models can only consider \nthe context preceding a word in text, and it cannot capture information following a word directly. To \naddress this, the BERT model introduced bidirectional self -attention, allowing it to consider both \npreceding and following context for each word. BERT does not rely on the previous word in the \nsequence, but it considers both the previous and the next word, and is therefore better at capturing subtle \nProceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning and AutomationDOI: 10.54254/2755-2721/42/20230794\n285\nrelationships and dependencies in the text. This application of bidirectional modeling builds on the \nfoundation laid by the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism. \nBERT divides the input text into tokens and then maps them to high -dimensional vectors to create \nword embeddings that provide semantic information for each token. These embeddings are the basis for \ngenerating queries, keys, and values for each token throug h matrix multiplications. These \nrepresentations are the basis for computing the self -attention score, which determines the relevance of \neach token to all other tokens [2]. Self-attention scores, determining token relevance in the context, are \ncalculated by multiplying queries with the transpose of keys and scaling them. BERT then constructs a \nweighted context representation, connecting each token to all others in the sequence, enabling better \ncontext understanding and semantic grasp [3]. To enhance modeling  capacity, BERT employs multi -\nhead self-attention and a stacked architecture with multiple encoder layers. Multi -head self-attention \ncaptures diverse relationships, while stacking improves token representations and context understanding. \nThe ALBERT model introduces parameter sharing and cross-layer parameter sharing mechanisms to \nenhance the efficiency of Transformer models, while reducing the number of parameters. Through \nparameter sharing, ALBERT shares most of the parameters among diffe rent layers, which means that \ndifferent layers use the same parameters. It can reduce the number of parameters in the model. It also \nhelps to improve the training and inference efficiency. Furthermore, ALBERT introduces cross -layer \nparameter sharing. It enables the model to better capture semantic relationships between different layers. \nThese innovations significantly improve model performance across various natural language processing \ntasks [6]. \nHowever, the limitations of the Albert model include its reduced performance in certain tasks \ncompared to larger models, primarily due to information loss resulting from parameter sharing. \nFurthermore, training costs of ALbert model remains relatively high. \nTransformer-XL model mainly introduces relative positional encoding and recurrence mechanism. \nRelative position encoding can make the model better understand the relationship between different \npositions in the sequence. At the same time, the recursive mechanism enables the model to handle longer \ntext sequences. These two innovations can enhance the model's ability to model context, and it can \ncapture long-distance dependencies. They have a significant impact on a variety of natural language \nprocessing tasks, thereby improving the performance and efficiency of the model [4]. \nBesides, XLNet model introduces self -attention regularization and permutation -based pre training \ntechniques. The self-attention regularization encourages the model to be more selective in attention, and \nit can make the model focus on the most relevant parts of the input. The permutation-based pre-training \ntechniques consider all possible permutations of the input sequence. This novel approach enables the \nmodel to learn from multiple context orders, enhancing its capacity to capture nuanced language \ndependencies. These enhancements play a crucial role in bolstering the model's robustness and its ability \nto comprehend intricate language structures [5]. \nTransformer-XL and XLNet are natural language processing models based on the Transformer \narchitecture, but they have notable differences. Transformer-XL introduces relative positional encodings, \nallowing it can handle long sequence data and capture long -range dependencies, which is particularly \nuseful for tasks that involve extensive text. In contrast. XLNet employs traditional absolute positional \nencodings, which exhibit lower performance, when dealing with long sequences. Furthermore, \nTransformer-XL is an autoregressive model, employing autoregressive mechanisms during both training \nand generation. XLNet adopts a non -autoregressive training approach, allowing it to use more \nsurrounding context to predict each token. It can offer superior performance in cer tain tasks. \nAdditionally, XLNet introduces Permutation Language Modeling to learn richer bidirectional \ndependencies, whereas Transformer -XL relies on conventional unidirectional language modeling. \nXLNet enhances parameter efficiency, and it performance thr ough a two-stream prediction parameter \nsharing mechanism. The choice between the two models depends on specific task requirements and \nperformance criteria, and these distinctions endow them with unique advantages in different tasks. \nRecently, based on Transformer, the GPT model is developed, The GPT model is a language model \nthat uses a Transformer framework and has strong language understanding and generation abilities \nProceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning and AutomationDOI: 10.54254/2755-2721/42/20230794\n286\nbecause it's trained on a lot of text data. The GPT -1 is a pretraining model based on the Transformer \narchitecture, designed to enhance natural language understanding through large -scale unsupervised \nlearning. GPT-1 initially undergoing self -supervised learning on extensive text data and subsequently \ndemonstrating excellent performance across various natural language processing tasks through fine -\ntuning. This research laid the foundation for subsequent GPT model iterations and has driven significant \nadvancements in the field of natural language processing. \nThe GPT model has been developed, with significant enhancements. For example, GPT-2 and GPT-\n3, these equipped with more parameters to better capture language patterns. Furthermore, fine -tuning \nthe pre -trained model on specific downstream tasks has enabled GPT to achieve state -of-the-art \nperformance across various natural language processing tasks. Furthermore, the careful prompt design \nallows researchers to guide the model perform a wide range of tasks. However, it's important to note \nthat GPT models come with challenges, including substantial computational and resource requirements \nand concerns about potential bias in content generation.  \nEach of these models, from BERT to ALBERT, Transformer -XL, XLNet, and GPT not only \nrepresent a significant advancement in NLP with unique strengths and applications, but also some \nlimitations and trade -offs. Researchers must choose the suitable model based  on requirements and \nperformance criteria of specific task. \n3.3.  Bidirectional Model Application \nThe bidirectional model's success can be attributed in part to its pre -training tasks, specifically the \nMasked Language Model and Next Sentence Prediction. Pre -trained on large amounts of textual data, \nBERT has gained profound linguistic comprehension capa bilities, making it an invaluable asset for a \nvariety of NLP tasks. Its applications span the fields of sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and \ntranslation.. Furthermore, The capability of bidirectional model proves invaluable for handling complex \ntext with intricate dependencies, making them adept at tasks involving ambiguity, intricate grammar, or \ncontext-dependent elements. In the realm of textual analysis, bidirectional models excel. Their \ncomprehensive understanding of contextual relationships  allows them to generate text that is more \ncoherent and logically structured. In the domain of question answering, they also provide more accurate \nanswers. Furthermore, in the field of sentiment analysis, where context plays a crucial role, bidirectional \nmodels excel in capturing subtle nuances of emotions within text. Named Entity Recognition also can \nget benefits from bidirectional models as they more effectively capture contextual cues related to entity \nnames, contributing to information extraction and t ext labeling. Bidirectional language models have \nadvantages in understanding and generating text in context. The applications span a wide range of \nnatural language processing tasks, enhancing accuracy, coherence, and adaptability across various \ndomains and challenges. \n4.  The trend of natural language processing development \nMultimodal fusion, knowledge graph reasoning, cross-domain applications, standardization, and ethical \nconsiderations will become the directions for research. The fusion of Graph Neural Network technology \nwith NLP is poised to elevate the capabilities of NL P in handling synthetic data to new heights. It not \nonly enhances the processing of individual textual data but also extends to handling multimodal data, \nincluding images, audio, and video, within synthetic information. The innovative potential lies in \nrepresenting knowledge graphs in graphical form and subsequently integrating them with mainstream \nNLP models. This integration not only augments the model's capacity to express knowledge but also \nenhances its ability to fuse information, enabling comprehensiv e comprehension and analysis of data \nfrom diverse sources. \nMultimodal knowledge fusion as a significant trend that means integrating not only textual data, but \nalso various data types into knowledge graphs, such as images, audio, and video. This will make NLP \nsystems more comprehensive, capable of handling diverse  information. For example, for a particular \nentity, we can acquire not only its textual description but also related images and audio data, enabling a \nmore comprehensive understanding and analysis. Another crucial trend will be the development of \nProceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning and AutomationDOI: 10.54254/2755-2721/42/20230794\n287\nknowledge graph reasoning. This implies that knowledge graphs will no longer remain static data \nrepositories but will be used for automatic inference of new knowledge. Through reasoning, systems \ncan automatically discover hidden relationships or attributes  among entities, enriching the content of \nknowledge graphs. This will enhance the dynamic nature and adaptability of knowledge graphs, making \nthem better suited to meet evolving information needs [11]. The combination of these two trends will \npropel NLP technology to make greater strides in handling multimodal data and knowledge reasoning, \nproviding us with more comprehensive and intelligent information processing capabilities. It will also \nhelp NLP systems better understand and respond to the ever-growing and diverse sources of data. \nLarge language models have emerged as a main trend in the field of Natural Language Processing, \nand it represent future direction with substantial impact. The large language models are characterized \nby their vast parameter count and robust computational po wer, and it have significantly elevated \nperformance across a spectrum of NLP tasks which include language comprehension, generation, and \ntranslation. Their remarkable generalization capabilities, acquired through extensive pre -training on \nlarge datasets, enable them to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and domains, reducing the need for task-\nspecific customization. \nFor instance, Evaluating the quality of generated text in summarization is a multifaceted challenge. \nLanguage assessment encounters a significant gap between established metrics and human judgment, \nencompassing both objective aspects like grammatical and s emantic accuracy and subjective factors \nsuch as completeness, brevity, and engagement. Large Language Models provide a comprehensive \nevaluation framework by comparing generated text with reference text, considering both objective and \nsubjective perspective s. Empirical results from experiments on two real summarization datasets \ndemonstrate our model's competitive performance and strong alignment with human assessors. This \nunderscores the potential of large-scale models in addressing the intricate aspects of text assessment and \ngeneration within the realm of NLP [12]. \nExploring domain adaptation and transfer learning strategies becomes imperative.  It means using \nNLP methods when you don't have much data or when you're dealing with very different topics. Low -\nresource languages encompass minority languages, regional dial ects, and seldom -used languages. It \ndiminishes the applicability of conventional deep learning approaches. Developing extensive annotated \ndatasets for these languages is an expensive endeavor, necessitating the pursuit of cost -effective \nannotation methodol ogies. Cross -lingual transfer methods assume a pivotal role in enhancing the \nperformance of low-resource languages by harnessing insights from other languages. Conversely, cross-\ndomain NLP tasks mandate NLP models to exhibit robust adaptability across dive rse domains. These \ntasks involve reconciling domain -specific disparities in terminology, syntax, and contextual nuances. \nGiven the high expenses associated with annotating data for different domains, exploring domain \nadaptation and transfer learning strate gies becomes imperative. Moreover, crafting models tailored to \nfulfill the requisites of domain-specific NLP tasks proves pivotal for effective cross-domain NLP. The \nzero-shot learning which involves text classification, and processing using machine learni ng models \nwithout annotated data. It emphasizes the latest NLP models that possess zero-shot learning capabilities, \nenabling them to perform text classification without prior labeled data. These models hold great utility \nfor various practical applications, particularly in cases where acquiring large-scale labeled data can be \nchallenging or costly, such as in specific domains or languages [13]. The development of these \ntechniques is expected to further advance research and applications in the field of NLP, e nhancing its \nscalability and adaptability. \n5.  Conclusion  \nThis paper mainly focuses on the evolution of language processing models in the field of Natural \nLanguage Processing, with a special emphasis on the transition from unidirectional to bidirectional \nmodeling. We delved into various aspects of the transformer  model, including its architecture, pre -\ntraining tasks, and performance in NLP tasks. Through this research, our goal is to gain a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the evolution of the transformer model and its implications for the field of NLP. \nProceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning and AutomationDOI: 10.54254/2755-2721/42/20230794\n288\nThe field of Natural Language Processing has undergone a significant evolution from unidirectional \nmodels to bidirectional models. At the first, the unidirectional models dominated filed of natural \nlanguage process. However, it still had limitations in understanding and generating text, since they could \nonly use the context they had observed up to that point. But with the rise of deep learning, bidirectional \nmodels like the Transformer that became significant breakthroughs. These models introduced self -\nattention mechanisms, and enable them to simultaneously consider all words in the context. For the \nresult, it can get substantial improvement in text processing performance. Methods like Transformer, \nBERT, XL-Net, GPT achieved outstanding pretraining through large-scale self-supervised learning, and \ndelivering remarkable results across various NLP tasks. The NLP field will continue to evolve towards \ngreater diversity and universality, including multimodal fusion, knowledge graphs and reasoning, low-\nresource lan guages, and cross -domain applications. Simultaneously, the NLP community needs to \naddress standardization and ethical issues in order to ensure fair and ethical use of the technology. This \nseries of developments will drive the forefront of NLP technology, offering more possibilities for \nvarious application scenarios while maintaining sustainability and credibility. \nReferences  \n[1] Vaswani, Ashish, et al. “Attention is all you need”.
