Formed through the coordination of metal ions or\nclusters with organic ligands, MOFs exhibit an exceptional\ncombination of high porosity, tunable chemical functionality,\nand structural adaptability. 1,2 These distinctive characteristics\nhave propelled MOFs to the forefront of materials science,\npositioning them as key enablers in addressing critical chal-\nlenges in energy, environmental sustainability, and biomedical\napplications.\n2–6 Furthermore, their highly customizable and\ntunable nature allows for precise structural and chemical\nmodifications, reinforcing their significance in both funda-\nmental research and industrial application.\nDespite their immense potential, the structural diversity that\nmakes MOFs highly attractive also introduces significant chal-\nlenges. Given the vast number of synthesized MOFs and\ncomputationally generated hypothetical MOFs, exploring opti-\nmal materials for specific applications has become increasingly\ncomplex.\n7,8 This challenge is further compounded by the\ninherent limitations of conventional trial-and-error approaches\nand the labor-intensive nature of experimental validation. In\nresponse, researchers have increasingly advocated for systema-\ntic, data-driven methodologies to eﬀectively navigate the vast\nchemical landscape of MOFs and accelerate the discovery of\napplication-specific materials (Scheme 1).\n9,10\nTo overcome these challenges, text mining has emerged as a\npowerful approach for systematically analyzing large-scale scien-\ntific literature. By applying natural language processing (NLP)\ntechniques, researchers can extract structured and informative\ndata from unstructured text, tables, and figures.\n11–13 The sys-\ntematic compilation of information on MOF synthesis condi-\ntions, experimental methodologies, and performance metrics\nfacilitates the construction of high-quality databases, establish-\ning a robust foundation for the accelerated discovery of novel\nmaterials. Beyond streamlining data extraction and enabling\nautomated database curation, text mining also aids in identify-\ning emerging research trends and uncovering previously over-\nlooked structure–property relationships within the literature.\n9,14\nThe most straightforward and fundamental text mining\napproach is manual curation by researchers, which involves\nsearching for relevant publications, identifying those that align\nwith a specific research focus, and extracting key textual\nelements such as paragraphs, sentences, and relevant terms.\nHowever, this method heavily depends on domain expertise,\nmaking it less scalable and eﬃcient for widespread use. More-\nover, with the rapid expansion of published literature, manually\nprocessing such a vast amount of information is increasingly\nimpractical, highlighting the necessity for more automated and\nsystematic approaches.\n15–17\nThe breakthroughs of NLP and machine learning (ML)\nmethodologies has transformed text mining research by\nenabling enhanced automation and more precise data extrac-\ntion. Techniques such as Word2Vec, Paragraph2Vec, and\nPaper2Vec facilitate the automated selection and classification\nof research papers.\n18–20 Named entity recognition (NER) using\nbidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) ML techni-\nques improve the classification, identification, and extraction\nof key information from unstructured text based on user-\ndefined labels, further improving data accessibility and\nusability.\n21–23 With the emergence of the transformer architecture\nin 2017,24 text mining research underwent a significant advance-\nment, driving the development of transformer-based models such\nas bidirectional encoder repres entations from transformers\n(BERT).\n25 BERT has since been adapted in various chemistry\nand materials science domains through specialized models like\nMatBERT,\n26 SciBERT27 and BatteryBERT28 substantially enhan-\ncing automation, efficiency, an da c c u r a c yc o m p a r e dt oe a r l i e r\nBi-LSTM-based NER models. Despite their advantages, rule-based\nmethods still required manual curation, limiting them to partially\nautomated workflows and single-purpose tools designed for\ndomain experts. These approaches struggled to handle the com-\nplexity and diversity of scientific literature.\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs), pretrained on\nvast datasets, has driven the innovation in text mining\nresearch.\n29–32 LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4 33 Gemini1.5,34\nand Llama3.135 demonstrate the ability to tackle tasks in chem-\nistry and materials science, even without explicit domain-specific\ntraining. Integrating LLMs into text mining facilitates a more\ncomprehensive and automated data extraction process while\noffering users with greater flexibility in decision-making. Recent\nstudies have explored fine-tuning of LLMs with prompt engi-\nneering using small, domain-specific chemical knowledge data-\nsets—consisting of only a few dozen samples—to further\nenhance the performance and adaptability of LLMs.\n36–38 A\nsignificant development in this area has been the emergence\nof iterative NLP workflows, where LLM-based models undergo\nrepeated cycles of extraction, error correction, and rule refine-\nment to enhance precision and recall in multi-step information\nharvesting.\nIn this feature article, we introduce the role of text mining in\nMOF research, with a particular focus on data extraction\ntechniques and their impact on scientific discovery.

We then review the latest advancements in\nLLM-based text mining, highlighting how LLMs have trans-\nformed methodologies and research trends of rule-based text\nmining. Finally, we discuss key insights and future directions for\nintegrating text mining into MOF research. Our aim is to make\ntext mining more accessible to both experimental and computa-\ntional MOF researchers, facilitating its seamless adoption into\ntheir workflows and accelerating data-driven discoveries.\n2. Machine learning and rule-based\ntext mining in MOF research\n2.1 Performance and stability descriptor extraction\nBefore the advent of rule-based or machine learning-driven text\nmining techniques, early eﬀorts in MOF data extraction relied\nalmost exclusively on manual curation by domain experts.\n39 This\nfoundational approach involved researchers meticulously iden-\ntifying relevant publications, carefully examining experimental\nsections, and extracting key textual information, numerical\nvalues, and structural descriptors into organized formats, often\nspreadsheet-like databases. While inherently labor-intensive and\nlimited in scalability—heavily depending on the specialized\nknowledge of individual researchers—this method was critical\nfor establishing the initial landscape of MOF research.\nCrucially, this considerable manual input provided the high-\nquality, reliable foundational data that underpinned the devel-\nopment of early MOF databases. These manually assembled\ndatasets, such as early iterations of the computation-ready,\nexperimental (CoRE) MOF Database and meticulously curated\nsubsets within the broader Cambridge Structural Database\n(CSD), served as invaluable ground truth for validating subse-\nquent automated text mining and data extraction systems\n(Table 1). The meticulous human oversight ensured the fidelity\nand chemical correctness of the extracted information, which\nwas paramount for the nascent stages of computational MOF\nresearch and played a pivotal role in developing this area of\nresearch. This legacy of expert-driven manual eﬀorts continues\nto inform current practices, with hybrid approaches combining\nautomated logic with expert oversight remaining vital in today’s\nsemi-automated data pipelines, particularly for validation and\nhandling complex cases.\nEarly NLP methodologies, predominantly rule-based approaches,\nrelied on pre-defined heuristics and keyword-based extraction tech-\nniques. While eﬀective in well-structured text formats, these meth-\nods struggled with linguistic variability and the complexity of\nscientific discourse. To overcome these limitations, such ML tech-\nniques have been incorporated into NLP workflows, enabling more\nflexible and scalable data extraction.\nIn 2018, the earliest application of text mining to MOFs was\nconducted by Kim et al., who developed a rule-based extraction\nsystem using regular expressions (RegEx) to retrieve surface\narea (SA) and pore volume (PV) from MOF-related literature.\n40\nThis algorithm was specifically designed to work with articles\nas hypertext markup language (HTML) format and employed\nRegEx to detect numerical values associated with SA and PV by\nidentifying their commonly used units ( e.g.,m\n2 g/C01 for SA and\ncm3 g/C01 for PV).\nThe study’s workflow consisted of HTML parsing, text\ntokenization, keyword filtering, and unit detection. Beautiful\nSoup 4.0 python library was used top r e p r o c e s sH T M Ld o c u m e n t s ,\neliminating irrelevant tags and extracting meaningful text. The\nalgorithm then categorized tokens into four groups—MOF name,\nunit, numerical value, and keywo rd—to systematically match SA\nand PV data to the correct MOF structures (Fig. 1a). A key\nchallenge addressed in this app roach was that MOF names were\nScheme 1 Timeline showing the evolution of text mining in MOF research, from rule-based NLP (2018) to ML-based approaches (2022), and LLM\nintegration (2023–2025).

To address this challenge, the algorithm searched\nfor up to four sentences forward and backward, ensuring a more\naccurate data mapping.\nTo further assess its accuracy, the algorithm was applied to\n2315 HTML files from the CoRE MOF database,\n41,42 an exten-\nsive collection of experimentally synthesized MOFs. This data-\nbase, largely derived from the CSD, shows how extensively MOF\ncollections have been curated and organized for computational\napplications. The CSD, a widely popular repository of crystal-\nlographic information, has drawn considerable attention since\nincorporating a comprehensive MOF subset. Notably, this sub-\nset is recognized as the world’s first automatically updated\nMOF dataset, containing nearly 100 000 structures as of 2020.\n43\nThe development of the CSD MOF subset marks a significant\nadvancement in automated, large-scale data extraction and\ndatabase maintenance. This infrastructure enables targeted\nsearches and detailed analysis of various MOF properties.\nFrom the complete set of articles in HTML format, the system\nextracted 490 SA values and 250 PV values, establishing a com-\nprehensive dataset for computat ional modelling. The remaining\ndocuments either did not report SA/PV values explicitly (for\nexample, presenting only graphical adsorption isotherms without\naccompanying numerical data), em p l o y e dn o n - s t a n d a r du n i t so r\nabbreviations beyond the predefined regex patterns, or exhibited\nHTML structures that impeded reliable parsing.\nGiven the impracticality of manually validating each extrac-\ntion, we randomly selected 50 papers for spot-checking. In\nthese cases, 134 of the 183 SA values (73.2%) and 200 of the\n235 PV values (85.1%) matched the manually curated reference,\ncompared to the 90% (SA) and 88.8% (PV) accuracies previously\nobtained on curated review papers.\nAdditionally, the text-mined surface areas were compared\nwith Zeo++-calculated values for the same collection of\nstructures (Fig. 1b). While a general linear trend is evident,\nseveral outliers in the bottom-right quadrant indicate instances\nwhere the simulation overestimated experimental BET results.\nThese deviations likely stem from various factors, including\nincomplete solvent removal in laboratory measurements, fra-\nmework distortions during activation, or the idealized pore\ngeometries assumed by Zeo++.\n44\nWhile the observations presented here highlight areas for\nimprovement in future work, particularly regarding the hand-\nling of unit formats and structural complexities, the overall\nconsistency with simulation data demonstrates the utility of\nrule-based text mining for extracting MOF performance proper-\nties from unstructured literature. An important advance in this\ncontext has been the emergence of iterative NLP workflows,\nwhere LLM-based models undergo repeated cycles of extrac-\ntion, error correction and rule refinement to improve both\nprecision and recall in multi-step information harvesting.\nTo overcome the limitations of purely rule-based methods,\nsubsequent work has focused on integrating machine learning\nmodels with NLP techniques to boost both extraction accuracy\nand predictive power. For example, Kulik et al. introduced\nMOFSimplify in 2022, combining ChemDataExtractor (CDE)\n45\nwith ML classifiers to extract and predict stability-related\ndescriptors.\n43 This study utilized NER and dependency parsing\nto retrieve solvent removal stability and thermal decomposition\ntemperatures from scientific texts (Fig. 2a). The resulting\ndataset encompassed 2179 solvent removal stability entries\nand 3132 thermal stability annotations, forming one of the\nlargest MOF stability datasets curated through NLP.\n43\nA significant advancement introduced in this study was the\nintegration of user-contributed thermogravimetric analysis\n(TGA) traces, allowing direct validation of text-mined data\nagainst experimental results (Fig. 2b). Comparative analyses\nwith manually curated datasets confirmed the high accuracy of\nFig. 1 (a) Example cases illustrating the identification scheme of a rule-based text mining algorithm.

For instance, MOFs having\nrefcode of SANGUM and SANHOH in the CSD demonstrated\ndecomposition temperatures of 514 1C and 343 1C, respectively,\nhighlighting the capability of automated NLP approaches in\nretrieving experimental stability data from the literature\n(Fig. 2b). The distribution of thermogravimetric analysis TGA-\nderived decomposition temperatures for MOFs reveals a normal\ndistribution centered around 359 1C with a standard deviation of\n87 1C (Fig. 2c). This visualization highlights the variability in\nMOF thermal stability and validates the robustness of the NLP-\nextracted dataset through systematic temperature extraction.\nTo further utilize the extracted data, artificial neural net-\nworks (ANNs) were trained using the mined stability dataset,\nachieving over 90% accuracy in predicting solvent removal\nstability and decomposition temperatures. This study exempli-\nfies how the synergy between text mining and ML enables\nthe transformation of literature-derived MOF descriptors into\npredictive modelling frameworks. In addition to stability\nassessment, ML and NLP-driven text mining has facilitated\nthe extraction of MOF synthesis conditions, including reaction\ntemperatures, solvents, and metal precursors. Kim et al. pio-\nneered an NLP-based system that extracted synthesis-relevant\ninformation from 28 565 MOF-related publications.\n23 This\nstudy utilized logistic regression, support vector machines\n(SVM), and random forest models for synthesis paragraph\nclassification, with logistic regression achieving the highest\nprecision ( 498%) in identifying synthesis-related passages.\nWithin the synthesis paragraph, bi-LSTM combined with con-\nditional random field (CRF) layer was used to extract and\ncategorize the relevant chemicals. Using the extracted dataset,\nan ANN was trained with positive-unlabeled (PU) learning to\nassess whether specific synthesis conditions would enable\nsuccessful synthesis. This text mining study enables research-\ners to facilitate ideal synthesis conditions and predict synthe-\nsizability based on literature patterns.\n2.2 Synthesis condition extraction and database construction\nThe use of natural language processing (NLP) in MOF research\nhas significantly improved the extraction and analysis of synth-\nesis conditions. Earlier studies primarily focused on extracting\nperformance-related descriptors, such as thermal stability\n43 or\nidentifying synthesis-relevant sections from scientific texts. 23\nMore recent eﬀorts have shifted toward constructing large-scale\ndatabases that systematically organize MOF synthesis para-\nmeters. This transition is necessary to address the limitations\nof manually curated datasets, which often restrict the scalabil-\nity of computational approaches for MOF synthesis analysis.\nOne of the most comprehensive implementations of this\nlarge-scale text mining approach is DigiMOF, which applies\nrule-based NLP parsing using ChemDataExtractor (CDE) to\nsystematically structure MOF synthesis data.\n46 To ensure\nextraction accuracy, DigiMOF employs an iterative parser train-\ning process, where text mining rules are refined and validated\nthrough continuous feedback (Fig. 3a). This iterative refine-\nment allows the database to improve precision while integrat-\ning newly published MOF synthesis studies.\nDigiMOF extracts key synthesis parameters, including sol-\nvents, metal precursors, and organic linkers, from a dataset of\nover 43 000 scientific publications. The database construction\nfollows a structured pipeline designed for eﬃcient and accurate\ndata retrieval. Initially, digital object identifiers (DOIs) linked to\nMOF-related publications were automatically retrieved from the\nCSD MOF subset. The extracted documents then underwent\npreprocessing steps, including tokenization, part-of-speech\n(POS) tagging, and chemical entity recognition, to segment\nand classify relevant textual components. This process\nimproves the accuracy of parameter identification and mini-\nmizes classification errors.\nFig. 2 Validation and application of machine learning (ML)-driven text\nmining for solvent removal stability and thermal decomposition tempera-\nture prediction.

The\nfinal dataset contains 52 680 synthesis property relationships\nacross 15 501 unique MOFs, covering approximately 15% of the\nCSD MOF subset. This automated text mining approach facil-\nitates the generation of a high-quality database that integrates\nMOF synthesis data for future predictive modeling and high-\nthroughput materials screening.\nIn addition to data extraction, DigiMOF’s corpus quantifies\ntopology usage at an unprecedented scale, confirming the\ndominance of sql and pcu frameworks while cataloguing 112\ndistinct topologies (Fig. 3b). The co-occurrence of synthesis\nparameters including solvent, temperature, and additive with\ntopology and linker data enables multivariate correlation ana-\nlyses that may uncover subtle protocol–structure relationships\nand inform targeted experimental design. Likewise, linker-\noccurrence mapping (Fig. 3c) verifies the predominance of\ncarboxylate and pyridyl ligands and also reveals less common\nchemistries, such as azolate, warranting further investigation.\nBy structuring these extensive datasets, DigiMOF establishes a\nfoundation for data-driven hypothesis generation and the sub-\nsequent development of predictive machine-learning frame-\nworks for MOF synthesis.\nWhile DigiMOF provides a structured repository of MOF\nsynthesis conditions, further eﬀorts have focused on refining\ntext mining techniques to extract synthesis-specific parameters\nwith greater accuracy. Tsotsalas et al. developed such an\napproach, implementing a multi-step workflow to systematically\nextract MOF synthesis parameters from scientific literature.\n47\nTsotsalas et al.applied a structured text mining approach to\nsystematically extract MOF synthesis parameters, beginning\nwith the collection of 6099 journal articles from major publish-\ners. First, a paragraph classification step was conducted using a\ndecision tree-based string search method to automatically\nselect synthesis-related sections from this large corpus, signifi-\ncantly reducing the need for manual curation and improving\nboth eﬃciency and scalability. Next, the ChemicalTagger soft-\nware was applied to the selected paragraphs to identify and\nextract key synthesis parameters, including solvents, reaction\ntemperatures, additive use, and reaction times.\nAfter identifying relevant text, ChemicalTagger, an NLP tool\ndesigned for parsing experimental procedures, was used to\nextract key synthesis parameters, including solvent, reaction\ntemperature, additive use, and reaction time. To improve\naccuracy, domain-specific modifications were made to the\nNLP pipeline, ensuring proper recognition and classification\nof MOF-related terminology, such as coordination environ-\nments, solvent polarity eﬀects, and metal precursor names.\nAdditionally, crystallographic information files (CIFs) were\nobtained from two well-curated structural repositories—the\nCoRE MOF and the CSD—and analyzed to extract structural\nattributes such as metal-center oxidation states, linker compo-\nsitions, and framework connectivity (Fig. 4a).\nTo validate the accuracy of the extracted data, a comparative\nanalysis with manually curated datasets was performed. The\ndataset was further analyzed to identify trends in synthesis\nparameter relationships. The temperature–solvent–additive\nrelationships with DMF and water dominating the 80–160 1C\nrange (Fig. 4b), water being universally used above 160 1C\n(consistent with hydrothermal methods), and acidic additives\nlargely limited to syntheses below 80 1C, are well established in\nMOF chemistry. However, automated text-mining at scale\nquantifies how frequently each protocol occurs across more\nthan 6000 publications and reveals unusual instances, such as\nhigh-temperature syntheses using acidic additives, that deviate\nfrom conventional practice. Furthermore, these comprehensive\nstatistics serve as a resource for generating hypotheses, drawing\nattention to underexplored solvent–additive combinations.\nFig. 3 Workflow and topological analysis of MOFs extracted through text\nmining.

The SynMOF data-\nbase, established through this automated text mining approach,\nserved as the basis for training ML models for synthesis condi-\ntion prediction. However, the primary focus remained on refin-\ning text mining techniques to achieve accurate extraction of\nsynthesis parameters. This work demonstrates the potential of\ncombining text-mined synthesis data with computational\nmodels to assist in guiding MOF synthesis strategies.\n3. LLM-based text mining\nDespite significant improvements in accuracy and adaptability\nof text mining achieved through ML and NLP techniques, rule-\nbased approaches still required extensive domain-specific fea-\nture engineering and struggled to handle the variability and\ncomplexity of scientific language. To address these limitations,\nrecent advancements in LLMs have introduced a more flexible\nand context-aware approach to text mining. Unlike rule-based\ntext mining approaches, which required extensive human inter-\nvention, LLMs have transformed knowledge extraction by\nenabling interpretation of complex information without requir-\ning extensive manual rules. They can process and analyse text\nwith minimal examples (zero-shot or few-shot learning) or be\nfine-tuned for specialized domains, allowing for flexible and\nadaptive data understanding.\nThe application of LLMs is expanding rapidly in various\nmaterials systems, beyond MOF research. Very recently, Lee\net al. introduced a language modeling-based protocol, text-to-\nbattery recipe (T2BR), for the automated extraction of complete\nbattery material recipes—from synthesis to cell assembly—by\nintegrating ML-based NLP and LLMs.\n48 Through the construc-\ntion of a structured dataset comprising 165 end-to-end recipes,\nthe study enabled the identification of trends such as precursor–\nmethod associations. In the field of water-splitting catalysis, Kim\net al. developed MaTableGPT, an LLM-based framework for\nextracting complex and diverse tabular data from scientific\nliterature.\n13 By introducing two key strategies—table data repre-\nsentation and table splitting—they improved GPT comprehen-\nsion and effectively filtered hallucinated information. Notably,\nthe few-shot learning approach emerged as the most balanced\nsolution, offering both a high extraction score (nearly 95% total\nF1 score) and low cost (GPT usage cost of 5.97 US dollars and\nlabeling cost of 10 I/O paired examples). Furthermore, Jain et al.\ndeveloped a LLM-based framework for extracting structured\nscientific knowledge from text, with a focus on diverse materials\ndomains: dopant–host relations, MOFs, and general composi-\ntion/phase/morphology/application relationships.\n49 By fine-\ntuning pre-trained LLMs—OpenAI’s GPT-3 (closed source) and\nMeta’s LLama-2 (open source)—they achieved high performance\nin joint NER and relation extraction (NERER), accurately trans-\nforming complex and hierarchical information into structured\nformats like JSON.\nWhile LLMs have shown great promise in academic research\nfor extracting structured scientific knowledge, their impact is\nalso extending rapidly into the industrial sector. Very recently,\nSattar et al.provide a comprehensive overview of how LLMs are\ntransforming industry by automating complex natural language\ntasks, delivering high accuracy in data mining, and decision-\nmaking.\n50 Applied across sectors such as medical, 51\nautomotive,52 education,53 e-commerce,54 and finance, 55 LMs\nenable applications ranging from predictive diagnostics and fraud\ndetection to personalized learning and real-time language transla-\ntion. Aforementioned studies collectively underscore the pivotal\nrole of LLMs in both various material science and industrial\ndomains, highlighting a potential to further integrate LLMs\nwithin MOF science. LLM-driven text mining into MOF fields\ncan facilitate the extraction of synthesis conditions, prediction of\nmaterial properties, and large-scale dataset generation.\nIn 2023, Yaghi et al. introduced a ChatGPT-based LLM\nframework (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) specifically designed for text\nmining in MOF chemistry, with a primary focus on extracting\nsynthesis parameters from MOF-related publications.\n56 By\nFig. 4 (a) Text-mining pipeline for extracting MOF synthesis parameters\nfrom literature.

Commun., 2025, 61, 11083–11094 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2025\nusing prompt engineering with chemistry-related tasks,\nresearchers developed a ChatGPT chemistry assistant (CCA).\nTo construct CCA, the study introduced a systematic prompt\nengineering approach, termed ChemPrompt Engineering,\nwhich was central to enabling domain-specific information\nextraction in a controlled and reproducible manner. The frame-\nwork consists of three core steps: (1) minimizing hallucination\nby designing role-based prompts that clearly define ChatGPT’s\ntask and scope as a chemistry assistant; (2) providing task-\nspecific instructions that guide the model to extract only\nrelevant synthesis parameters—such as metal sources, linkers,\nsolvents, temperatures, and reaction times—from varied experi-\nmental contexts; and (3) structuring the output format to\nensure consistency and usability, typically in tabulated or\nJSON-style entries. This strategy not only improved the accuracy\nand interpretability of extracted information but also demon-\nstrated that LLMs, when guided by domain-adapted prompts,\ncan serve as scalable alternatives to traditional rule-based text\nmining systems in chemical literature analysis.\nThis model processes full-text research articles, automati-\ncally identifies key synthesis parameters such as metal sources,\nlinkers, solvents, reaction temperature, and reaction time. In its\ninitial validation, CCA was applied to a curated corpus of 228\nMOF research articles (and their 225 supporting documents),\nyielding 2387 unique synthesis condition relationships. On this\nset, CCA achieved true positive counts exceeding 2000 for most\nparameter categories, demonstrating high extraction precision\nacross metal source, linker, solvent, reaction temperature, and\nreaction time (Fig. 5a).\nFurthermore, performance evaluations across three\nindependent extraction processes revealed consistently high\nprecision, recall, and F1 scores, highlighting the robustness\nof LLM-based text mining approaches in handling complex\nscientific language (Fig. 5b). In this study, the three processe-\ns—process 1 (sentence-level extraction), process 2 (paragraph-\nlevel summarization), and process 3 (multi-step extraction\ncombining classification, summarization, and structur-\ning)—were designed to test the model’s adaptability to diﬀerent\ninput formats and task complexities. The consistently high\nperformance across all three processes underscores the flex-\nibility of CCA in processing scientific texts under varying levels\nof context and abstraction.\nTo demonstrate scalability, the pipeline was subsequently\ndeployed across approximately 800 unique MOF structures,\nextracting 26 257 distinct synthesis parameter instances from\npeer-reviewed publications. Compared to conventional rule-\nbased data mining methods, the CCA has demonstrated the\npotential for a more flexible and scalable approach to proces-\nsing unstructured synthesis descriptions. LLM-based text\nextraction enables the creation of large-scale MOF synthesis\ndatabases, facilitating data-driven materials discovery and pre-\ndictive synthesis modelling.\nThe ability to process vast amounts of scientific literature is\na key advantage of LLMs over traditional NLP and ML-based\ntext mining techniques. One of the most significant demonstra-\ntions of this capability is the very recent study by Kim et al.,\nwhich implemented a LLM framework to extract and categorize\nMOF synthesis data from 41 681 scientific papers.\n57\nTo handle this large-scale dataset, the study employed a\nsystematic pipeline consisting of three core tasks: categoriza-\ntion, inclusion, and information extraction. First, the model\nclassified whether each paragraph was relevant to MOF synth-\nesis (categorization task), followed by a decision on whether the\nsynthesis information in the paragraph was complete enough\nto include in the dataset (inclusion task). Finally, for the\nparagraphs that passed both stages, detailed synthesis para-\nmeters such as metal sources, organic linkers, solvents, and\nadditives were extracted using structured prompts (extraction\ntask). The LLM achieved high F1 scores across all three tasks,\nwith especially strong performance in the categorization and\nextraction steps, demonstrating the model’s ability to process\nhighly unstructured experimental text with minimal rule-based\nintervention.\nThe resulting dataset, compiled from synthesis-relevant\nparagraphs, encompasses detailed information on synthesis\nconditions and material properties. Statistical analysis of the\nmined data revealed meaningful trends: solvent types were the\nFig. 5 Performance evaluation of text-mining processes for extracting\nMOF synthesis parameters.

Furthermore, compound-wise statistics showed\nthat a large portion of MOFs were associated with multiple\nsynthesis records, reflecting the diversity of experimental con-\nditions under which the same material can be synthesized. The\nauthors also analysed the distribution of synthesis data by\npublication year and journal, highlighting the steady increase\nin MOF synthesis reports and the broad coverage of the mined\ndataset across the chemical literature.\nThe use of LLM-based text mining enables the construction\nof large-scale experimental property datasets that were pre-\nviously diﬃcult to compile using manual or rule-based meth-\nods. Leveraging this capability, the authors performed a large-\nscale comparison between text-mined experimental values and\nsimulation-derived values for surface area (SA) and pore volume\n(PV), allowing for a more systematic evaluation of their\nconsistency (Fig. 6b and c). The analysis revealed notable\ndiscrepancies between the two data sources. While simulation\nvalues were consistent and singular for each MOF structure, the\nexperimental values obtained from literature showed substan-\ntial variation, even for the same compound (Fig. 6d and e). This\nvariance can be attributed to several factors. Simulations are\ntypically based on idealized, defect-free models and do not\naccount for real-world influences such as temperature, pres-\nsure, humidity, or the presence of guest molecules. Further-\nmore, experimental values can vary depending on synthesis\nroutes, measurement techniques, and inconsistencies in\nreporting practices across diﬀerent publications. These factors\ncontribute to the broad range observed in the experimental\ndata, in contrast to the uniformity of simulation outputs.\nThese findings highlight the importance of accounting for\nsuch discrepancies when integrating computational and experi-\nmental datasets in MOF research. As LLM-based text mining\nbecomes more widely used for database construction, it will be\ncritical to consider the contextual and methodological varia-\nbility inherent in experimental data to ensure robust compar-\nison and integration with simulation results.\n4. Conclusion and perspectives\nThe integration of text mining into MOF research represents a\nparadigm shift in material design, synthesis, and optimization.\nThis feature article highlights key advancements in text mining\nacross the MOF landscape, spanning from traditional rule-\nbased extraction to state-of-the-art LLM-based text mining.\nConventional NLP and ML techniques, such as part-of-speech\ntagging and NER, have revolutionized data extraction by con-\nverting unstructured scientific literature into structured data-\nsets, thereby uncovering critical synthesis trends. LLM-based\ntext mining has further streamlined this process, significantly\nimproving data accessibility and usability. By automating infor-\nmation retrieval, interpretation, extraction and curation, LLMs\nlower the technical barrier, making complex computational\ntools more accessible to researchers across various disciplines.\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain in\nfully harnessing text mining for MOF research. To address\nthese challenges and further expand its capabilities, we pro-\npose four key directions for future advancements in text mining\napplications.\n4.1 Integration of GUI in MOF informatics\nEven prior to the release of ChatGPT, several pre-trained\ntransformer models were available; however, their adoption\nwas not very impactful. The emergence of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)\nin 2022 marked a turning point, catalyzing the application of\nLLMs across diverse domains including computer science,\nmaterials science, biology, industry, and finance. While this\nrapid expansion can be partly attributed to technological\nadvancements and improved model performance, a critical\nenabler was the development of a chat-style graphical user\ninterface (GUI), which significantly lowered the barrier to entry\nFig. 6 (a) Overview of the L2M3 data extraction and organization work-\nflow. Literature papers are processed by a data extraction agent that\nidentifies and extracts information from tables and text, including synthesis\nconditions and characteristic properties.

Commun., 2025, 61, 11083–11094 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2025\nby allowing users to interact with LLMs through a simple,\nintuitive webpage. In this context, embedding a GUI with text-\nmined data oﬀers a powerful approach to make structured\nmaterials datasets more accessible and interpretable to a\nbroader research community.\nInteractive GUI platforms such as the materials project\n58\nand the Cambridge Structural Database 59 have played a pivotal\nroles in recent advancements in AI-assisted materials infor-\nmatics by enabling intuitive data retrieval. The GUI-based\nplatforms are now being actively developed into other materials\nfield, such as catalysts\n60,61 and batteries 62 to support structure-\nperformance visualization, and machine learning-assisted\nmaterial screening. In the MOF domain, the QMOF database\nwas integrated into Materials Project, providing DFT-derived\nproperties ( e.g., optimized structures, bandgaps, and band\nstructures).\n63 Similarly, the recent update of the CoRE MOF\n2025 database 64 introduced a streamlined web interface that\nallows users to simply drag and drop CIF files to compute\ngeometric descriptors and predict properties such as water and\nthermal stability. Beyond simple data retrieval, integrating\nextracted data into chatbot-based GUIs (like ChatGPT) can\nassist users in better understanding the data and generating\nresearch ideas.\n56,65\nTherefore, developing accessible and user-friendly GUIs will\nbecome increasingly important in materials science to ensure\nthat a wider range of researchers can utilize available tools and\ndata. Integrating text-mined information into interactive GUIs\nis able to eliminate the need for rigid, formally structured\nqueries, lowering the barrier for non-experts. As these tools\nevolve, they hold the potential to support intuitive data explora-\ntion and significantly accelerate materials discovery.\n4.2 Text mining-driven multi-agent AI systems\nMOF synthesis process is inherently complex, requiring precise\ncontrol over numerous variables such as metal precursors,\norganic linkers, solvents, and reaction conditions. Due to the\nintricate nature of laboratory workflows, AI is often applied only\nto isolated stages of research, leading to a disjointed process\nthat heavily depend on human intervention. Multi-agent AI\nsystems trained on domain-specific text-mined knowledge oﬀer\na more integrated and robust solution.\n66 By assigning specia-\nlized AI agents to tasks such as reaction condition prediction,\nstructure–property correlation, and synthesis planning,\nresearchers can develop an autonomous and precise system\ncapable of continuously optimizing MOF synthesis strategies\nbased on structured knowledge extracted from the literature. A\nrecent study by Yaghi et al. demonstrates a team of seven\ndistinct AI research assistants which was assembled to opti-\nmize the crystallinity of MOFs and covalent organic frameworks\n(COFs).\n67 Each AI assistant specialized in specific research\ntasks, including literature review, laboratory operations, and\ndata interpretation, working collaboratively to expedite the\ndiscovery of optimal synthesis conditions. To develop such\nmulti-agent AI systems, training each agent on text-mined data\nfrom specialized fields is essential, ensuring that AI-driven\ndecision-making is grounded in accurate, context-specific\nscientific knowledge. A well-established text mining architec-\nture enables multiple AI agents to collaborate effectively,\nthereby reducing reliance on human oversight and accelerating\nadvancements in MOF research.\n4.3 Integrating text mining into autonomous laboratory\nAn autonomous laboratory (A-Lab) aims to integrate robotics\nhardware and AI-driven software to accelerate materials dis-\ncovery with minimal human control.\n68–70 These systems are\ndesigned to plan, execute, and analyse experiments in a closed-\nloop workflow, optimizing synthesis conditions and improving\nreproducibility. The ultimate goal of A-Lab is to transition from\nmanual experimental design to fully automated material synth-\nesis and characterization, where AI-driven decision-making\nguides every step. However, current A-Lab primarily focus on\nreaction execution, while data curation and interpretation\nremain major bottlenecks, as synthesis and characterization\nresults are often unstructured and require expert analysis.\nIntegrating real-time text mining into A-Lab enables the extrac-\ntion of structured insights from both scientific literature and\nin situ experimental data, enhancing active learning through\ncontinual data feeding and refinement while optimizing user-\ndesired material synthesis by dynamically improving AI-driven\nsynthesis planning, reaction parameter selection, and character-\nization analysis. For example, retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) is a framework that enhances LLMs by dynamically\nretrieving and integrating external, up-to-date information into\ntheir generative process,\n71,72 thereby enabling A-Lab to autono-\nmously refine experimental decisions and adapt synthesis pro-\ntocols with enhanced accuracy. Notably, integrating accurate text\nmining into RAG transforms unstructured experimental and\nliterature data into structured, actionable insights, significantly\nimproving data interpretation in the feedback loop of A-Lab. The\nintegration of text mining allows A-Lab to continuously update\ntheir knowledge base, facilitating machine-to-human commu-\nnication through natural language, thereby accelerating explora-\ntion of vast MOF chemical spaces.\n4.4 Multi-modal LLM-enhanced data mining for\ncomprehensive MOF data extraction\nIn scientific literature, data can be represented in various\nforms, including 1D text, 2D images, and 3D chemical files\n(e.g. XYZ, crystallographic information file; cif, protein data bank;\npdb), each providing unique insights and information.\n73,74 Con-\nventional text mining technique s primarily focus on extracting\ninformation from unstructured text, often neglecting critical data\nembedded in tables, graphs and files. However, many essential\naspects of MOF research, such as syn thesis conditions, character-\nization results, and structure–property relationships, are com-\nmonly presented in graphical plo ts, reaction schemes, and even\nsimulation videos. For instance, nitrogen adsorption isotherms\nused to determine BET surface a rea are typically presented as\ngraphical plots; powder X-ray diffraction patterns appear as a\ncombination of graphs and textual annotations; and gas diffusion\nbehaviors within MOF pores are often illustrated through mole-\ncular dynamics trajectory videos.
