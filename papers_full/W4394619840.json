  "abstract": "Abstract Nanjing Yunjin, a traditional Chinese silk weaving craft, is celebrated globally for its unique local characteristics and exquisite workmanship, forming an integral part of the world's intangible cultural heritage. However, with the advancement of information technology, the experiential knowledge of the Nanjing Yunjin production process is predominantly stored in text format. As a highly specialized and vertical domain, this information is not readily convert into usable data. Previous studies on a knowledge graph-based Nanjing Yunjin Question-Answering System have partially addressed this issue. However, knowledge graphs need to be constantly updated and rely on predefined entities and relationship types. Faced with ambiguous or complex natural language problems, knowledge graph information retrieval faces some challenges. Therefore, this study proposes a Nanjing Yunjin Question-Answering System that integrates Knowledge Graphs and Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques. In this system, the ROBERTA model is first utilized to vectorize Nanjing Yunjin textual information, delving deep into textual semantics to unveil its profound cultural connotations. Additionally, the FAISS vector database is employed for efficient storage and retrieval of Nanjing Yunjin information, achieving a deep semantic match between questions and answers. Ultimately, related retrieval results are fed into the Large Language Model for enhanced generation, aiming for more accurate text generation outcomes and improving the interpretability and logic of the Question-Answering System. This research merges technologies like text embedding, vectorized retrieval, and natural language generation, aiming to overcome the limitations of knowledge graphs-based Question-Answering System in terms of graph updating, dependency on predefined types, and semantic understanding. System implementation and testing have shown that the Nanjing Yunjin Intelligent Question-Answering System, constructed on the basis of Knowledge Graphs and Retrieval Augmented Generation, possesses a broader knowledge base that considers context, resolving issues of polysemy, vague language, and sentence ambiguity, and efficiently and accurately generates answers to natural language queries. This significantly facilitates the retrieval and utilization of Yunjin knowledge, providing a paradigm for constructing Question-Answering System for other intangible cultural heritages, and holds substantial theoretical and practical significance for the deep exploration and discovery of the knowledge structure of human intangible heritage, promoting cultural inheritance and protection.",
