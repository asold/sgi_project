Inspired by the frame-\nworks utilized in the the task of neural machine\ntranslation (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Cho et al., 2014),\nthe pioneer researchers formulate the dialogue gen-\neration task as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)\ntranslation problem (Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals\nand Le, 2015; Sordoni et al., 2015). Encoder is de-\nsigned for dialogue context modeling, and decoder\n1Code and data available at http://github.com/lipiji/Guyu.\nis constructed to conduct the target response predic-\ntion. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochre-\niter and Schmidhuber, 1997), Gated Recurrent Unit\n(GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), and Transformer Self-\nAttention Network (SAN) (Vaswani et al., 2017)\nare employed as the backbone of various encoders\nand decoders. For training, Maximum Likelihood\nEstimation (MLE) is usually as the parameter op-\ntimization approach. For decoding, beam search\nalgorithm (Koehn, 2004) is the preference to de-\ncode and generate the target response.\nTremendous progress has been achieved follow-\ning those pioneer works. Simultaneously, on one\nside, researchers propose some strategies to ad-\ndress the typical issues observed from the gener-\nated results, and on the other side, amount of new\ndirections and tasks have been explored broadly\n(Gao et al., 2019a). Speciﬁcally, one well-know\ntypical phenomenon is that the generated responses\nare usually generic and boring. Quiet a few re-\nsults are neither relevant to the context nor infor-\nmative and diverse. This is caused by various of\nreasons, such as the MLE optimization objective,\nsemantic or posterior collapse of the input context\nrepresentations, one-to-many mapping issue (one\nsingle query can match several different but cor-\nresponding responses), etc. To address this issue,\nlots of model structures, training strategies, and\noperation tricks have been constructed and pro-\nposed, such as the Maximum Mutual Information\n(MMI) optimization objective (Li et al., 2016a),\nadversarial training (Li et al., 2017a; Xu et al.,\n2017; Zhang et al., 2018b) or reinforcement learn-\ning (Li et al., 2016c; Cuay ´ahuitl, 2017; Dhingra\net al., 2017) tricks, continuous or discrete latent se-\nmantic modeling approaches (Zhao et al., 2017; Gu\net al., 2018; Gao et al., 2019b; Qiu et al., 2019; Gao\net al., 2019c), hierarchical encoder-decoder frame-\nworks (HRED) for multi-turn dialogue generation\n(Serban et al., 2016, 2017; Park et al., 2018), etc.\narXiv:2003.04195v1  [cs.CL]  9 Mar 2020\nMeanwhile, expanded from the general dialogue\ngeneration problem, more interesting and challeng-\ning tasks have been explored. For instance, per-\nsona context (Li et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2018a;\nMazare et al., 2018; Chan et al., 2019; Madotto\net al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020)\nand emotional information (Zhou et al., 2018a,c,a;\nHuang et al., 2018; Rashkin et al., 2019; Li et al.,\n2019a) are incorporated into the basic framework to\nimprove the anthropomorphic characteristic. Exter-\nnal knowledge such as the Commonsense Knowl-\nedge (Liu and Singh, 2004) is also introduced to\nconduct the knowledge-grounded dialogue genera-\ntion (Ghazvininejad et al., 2018; Young et al., 2018;\nZhou et al., 2018b; Dinan et al., 2018). The prob-\nlem of sentence function controlled dialogue gen-\neration has also been investigated (Ke et al., 2018;\nBi et al., 2019).\nRecently, pre-trained transformer-based lan-\nguage models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)\nand GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019b,a) have achieved\ntremendous success in various tasks of natural\nlanguage processing such as text classiﬁcation,\ntext matching, question answering, summarization\n(Dong et al., 2019), storytelling (See et al., 2019),\netc. Researchers are also trying to construct the\ntransformer-based language models for the task\nof dialogue generation. Typically, Olabiyi and\nMueller (2019) conduct some experimental anal-\nysis about the performance of transformer-based\nauto-regressive language models on dialogue gen-\neration. Li et al. (2019b) propose a relevance-\npromoting language model by incorporating a topic\ninference component into the transformer language\nmodel to conduct diverse and informative response\ngeneration. Zhang et al. (2019) introduce a pre-\ntraining stage and MMI (Li et al., 2016a) is em-\nployed for results re-ranking and selection. Adiwar-\ndana et al. (2020) release a chat-bot named Meena\nwhich is constructed based on Evolved Transformer\n(ET) (So et al., 2019) with 2.6B parameters and is\ntrained on a large-scale multi-turn open domain\ndialogue corpus with 867M context-response pairs\n(341G text data with 40B words). A new human\nevaluation metric called Sensibleness and Speci-\nﬁcity Average (SSA) is proposed and experimental\nresults demonstrate that perplexity highly corre-\nlates with SSA.\nIn this paper, we present an empirical study of\npre-trained transformer-based auto-regressive lan-\nguage models for the task of open-domain dialogue\ngeneration. The purpose is to construct a vividly\nsense and understanding of the performance for the\n(pre-trained) transformer-based auto-regressive lan-\nguage models on the tasks of open-domain dialogue\ngeneration. Training paradigm of pre-training and\nﬁne-tuning is employed to conduct the parameter\nlearning. Corpora of News and Wikipedia in Chi-\nnese and English are collected for the pre-training\nstage respectively. Dialogue context and response\nare concatenated into a single sequence which is\nutilized as the input of the language model dur-\ning the ﬁne-tuning stage. A weighted joint pre-\ndicting paradigm for both context and response is\ndesigned to evaluate the performance of models\nwith or without the loss term for the context pre-\ndiction results. Various of decoding strategies such\nas greedy search, beam search, top-k sampling,\netc. are employed to conduct the response text pre-\ndiction. Extensive experiments are conducted on\nthe typical single-turn and multi-turn dialogue cor-\npora such as Weibo (Shang et al., 2015; Gao et al.,\n2019b), Douban (Pan et al., 2019), Reddit (Zhou\net al., 2018b), DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017b), and\nPersona-Chat (Zhang et al., 2018a). Detailed num-\nbers of automatic evaluation metrics on relevance\n(BLEU) and diversity (Distinct n-gram ratios) of\nthe generated results are reported.\nIn the following sections, we will ﬁrst introduce\nthe model architecture (Section 2), and then the\nexperimental settings (Section 3) and results dis-\ncussions (Section 4). Finally, we will provide suf-\nﬁcient examples to demonstrate the performance\n(Section 5) and following the conclusions as well\nas the future plans (Section 6).\n2 Model Architecture\nAs shown in Figure 1, the core model architecture\ninvestigated in this work is a GPT-2 (Radford et al.,\n2019a) like transformer-based auto-regressive lan-\nguage model. We use X = (x0,x1,x2,...,x m)\nand Y = (y0,y1,y2,...,y n) to denote the se-\nquence of input context and target response respec-\ntively. mand nrepresent the length of context and\nresponse, respectively. It should be noted that we\nregard the input context as a whole sequence, either\nsingle-turn query or multi-turn historical context\nutterances. Considering that the basic framework\nis a auto-regressive language model, therefore, we\nconcatenate the context sequence X and the re-\nsponse sequence Y and obtain a whole sequence\nI = (X,Y ) as the input. For convenience, we as-\n<bos>Input\nTokenEmbeddings\nPositionalEmbeddings\n𝐄𝒙𝟎\n𝐄1 𝐄2 𝐄3 𝐄4 𝐄5 𝐄7𝐄6𝐄0\n<eos>Output\n𝑥0 𝑥1 𝑥2 𝑥3 𝑦0 𝑦1 𝑦2\n𝐄<bos>\n<bos>𝑥1 𝑥2 𝑥3 𝑦0 𝑦1 𝑦2\n𝐄𝒙𝟏 𝐄𝒙𝟐 𝐄𝒙𝟑 𝐄𝒚𝟎 𝐄𝒚𝟏 𝐄𝒚𝟐\nContextPrediction ResponsePrediction\nFigure 1: Transformer-based auto-regressive language model for dialogue generation.\nsume that the separator token <bos> between X\nand Y is the last token xm ∈X, then we can de-\nnote the ﬁnal sequence length as T = |I|= m+ n.\nMasking multi-head self-attention is utilized as\nthe core technical operation to conduct representa-\ntion learning:\nH1\nt = LN\n(\nFFN(H1\nt ) +H1\nt\n)\nH1\nt = LN\n(\nSLF-ATT(Q0\nt ,K0\n≤t,V0\n≤t) +H0\nt\n)\nQ0 = H0WQ\nK0,V0 = H0WK,H0WV\n(1)\nwhere SLF-ATT(·), LN(·), and FFN(·) represent\nself-attention mechanism, layer normalization, and\nfeed-forward network respectively (Vaswani et al.,\n2017). Note that we only use the states whose\nindices ≤tas the attention context.\nTraining: During training, we employ Maximum\nLikelihood Estimation (MLE) to conduct the pa-\nrameter learning and treat negative log-likelihood\n(NLL) over the whole target response sequence as\nthe loss function:\nLy\nnll = −\nn∑\nt=1\nlog P(yt|y<t,X) (2)\nIntuitively, since we have concatenated X and\nY, then we can obtain another term of prediction\nloss, i.e., the loss term for predicting the dialogue\ncontext X.\nLx\nnll = −\nm∑\nt=1\nlog P(xt|x<t) (3)\nConsidering that context and response are mono-\nlingual pairs, then introduce the context predic-\ntion loss may beneﬁt the language modeling per-\nformance, since context texts contribute the other\nhalf of corpus to teach the model how to handle\na language. This assumption is also mentioned in\nthe previous works of Olabiyi and Mueller (2019)\nand Li et al. (2019b). Therefore, a weighted joint\npredicting paradigm for both context and response\nis constructed. By tuning the weight, we can also\nevaluate the performance of models with or without\nthe loss term for the context prediction results.\nLnll = Ly\nnll + λ×Lx\nnll (4)\nDecoding: In the inference stage, various of decod-\ning strategies such as greedy search, beam search\n(Koehn, 2004), truncated top-ksampling (Fan et al.,\n2018; Radford et al., 2019b), and Nucleus Sam-\npling (top-psampling) (Holtzman et al., 2019) are\nemployed to conduct the response text generation.\nHyper-parameter such as kis tuned to trade-off the\nperformance of relevance and diversity.\n3 Experimental Settings\n3.1 Datasets\nPre-training Corpus: To investigate the perfor-\nmance of models in different language scenarios,\nwe conduct the pre-training procedure on two large\nscale corpora in Chinese and English respectively.\n•Chinese: We collect Chinese Wikipedia2 (1.7B\nCharacters) and a merged Chinese News corpus\n(9.2B Characters) from the Internet. We did not\nconduct the word segmenting operations on the\nChinese datasets, which means that we just use\nthe characters to build the vocabulary, and the\nsize is 27,681.\n•English: We employ English Wikipedia3 (2.4B\nwords) and BooksCorpus (980M words) (Zhu\n2https://dumps.wikimedia.org/zhwiki/latest/\n3https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/\net al., 2015) to conduct the pre-training. Byte\nPair Encodings (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016) is\nconducted on this corpus as the tokenizer and the\nvocabulary size is 32,000.\nFine-tuning Dialogue Corpus Five typical dia-\nlogue corpora are collected to train the dialogue\ngeneration models: Weibo (Shang et al., 2015; Gao\net al., 2019b), Douban (Pan et al., 2019), Reddit\n(Zhou et al., 2018b), DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017b),\nand Persona-Chat (Zhang et al., 2018a). These cor-\npora are in different languages with single-turn or\nmulti-turn historical dialogue context. Moreover,\nsome pre-deﬁned external information are also pro-\nvided in the dataset of Persona-Chat besides the\npure dialogue utterances.\n•Weibo: A single-turn open-domain Chinese dia-\nlogue dataset, which is originally collected and\nreleased by Shang et al. (2015) from a Chinese\nsocial media platform Weibo4. Here, we use a\nreﬁned version released by Gao et al. (2019b) 5.\nThe number of samples for training, validation,\nand testing are 400M, 19357, and 3200 respec-\ntively. Character-based vocabulary size is 10231.\n•Douban: A multi-turn open-domain Chinese di-\nalogue corpus collected from Douban group6, a\nwell-known Chinese online community which\nis also a common data source for dialogue sys-\ntems (Wu et al., 2017). Here, we utilize a version\ncalled Restoration-200K dataset released by Pan\net al. (2019) 5. There are 193769 samples for\ntraining, 5095 for validation, and 5104 for test-\ning. V ocabulary size is 5800.\n•Reddit: A single-turn open-domain English cor-\npus. We use the version collected and processed\nby Zhou et al. (2018b) 7. The original version\nis designed for commonsense dialogue gener-\nation, and here we only keep the dialogue ut-\nterances and ﬁlter the commonsense knowledge\nannotations. There are 300M samples for train-\ning, 10000 for validation, and 20000 for testing.\nBPE vocabulary size is 14820.\n•DailyDialog: A multi-turn open-domain English\ncorpus released by Li et al. (2017b) 8. There are\n11118 for training, 1000 for validation, and 1000\nfor testing. BPE vocabulary size is 12244.\n•Persona-Chat: Another multi-turn open-\ndomain English corpus, which contains 8939\n4https://www.weibo.com/\n5https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/dialogue/#datasets\n6https://www.douban.com/group\n7http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ﬁle/commonsense conversation\ndataset.tar.gz\n8http://yanran.li/dailydialog.html\nsamples for training, 1000 for validation, and\n968 for testing after ﬁltering (Zhang et al.,\n2018a). Moreover, this dataset provides 3-5 sen-\ntences to describe the persona information for\neach speaker (e.g. “ I like reading.” or “I am a\nnurse.”, etc). In our tasks, we concatenate the se-\nquence of persona sentences before the dialogue\ncontext as another kind of condition to control\nthe response generation. BPE vocabulary size is\n11362.\nThe speciﬁc statistic numbers of the dialogue\ncorpus are depicted in Table 1. We can observe\nthat Weibo and Reddit can be treated as large-scale\ncorpora, and Douban is a midle-size dataset. Com-\nparatively, DailyDialog and Persona-Chat are in\nsmall-scale.\n3.2 Metrics\nAs did in the previous works, we employ BLEU 9\nand Distinct n-gram ratios as the automatic evalu-\nation metrics. For BLEU, we provide the values\nof BLEU 1-4 as well as a weighted summation of\nthem. For Distinct, we calculate the uni-gram and\nbi-gram distinct rations and both macro-average\n(MADIST , average on instance level) and micro-\naverage (MIDIST , average on corpus level) val-\nues are reported. Moreover, we also provide the\naverage-length of the generated response for refer-\nence. More automatic metrics such as PPL, Em-\nbedding Matching, METEOR, etc., as well as the\nhuman evaluation performance will be completed\nin the future.\n3.3 Comparison Methods\n•Seq2Seq: The vanilla Transformer Sequence-to-\nSequence model used for machine translation\nwhere the network components are identical to\nthose in (Vaswani et al., 2017).\n•CV AE(Zhao et al., 2017): Variational Auto-\nEncoder (V AE) (Kingma and Welling, 2013) is\nintroduced into the LSTM-based seq2seq frame-\nwork for context semantic modeling and re-\nsponse generation.\n•MMI (Li et al., 2016a): LSTM-based seq2seq\nframework with Maximum Mutual Information\n(MMI) objective in decoding . In this paper, we\nset the number of responses for re-ranking as 50.\n•HRED (Serban et al., 2016): A hierarchical\nRNN-based encoder-decoder constructed for the\ntasks of multi-turn dialogue generation.\n9https://github.com/tensorﬂow/nmt/blob/master/nmt/scripts/bleu.py\nCorpus Language Type #Train #Dev #Test #V ocab\nWeibo Chinese Single-Turn 4,244,093 19,357 3,200 10,231\nDouban Chinese Multi-Turn 193,769 5,095 5,104 5,800\nReddit English Single-Turn 3,384,185 10,000 20,000 14,820\nDailyDialog English Multi-Turn 11,118 1,000 1,000 12,244\nPersona-Chat English Multi-Turn 8,939 1,000 968 11,362\nTable 1: Statistics of the dialogue datasets.\n•VHRED (Serban et al., 2017): Variational Auto-\nEncoder (V AE) (Kingma and Welling, 2013) is\nincorporated into the HRED model for better\nsemantic modeling for each dialogue utterance.\n•VHCR (Park et al., 2018): An extension of\nVHRED, where a hierarchical latent variable\nmodel with the utterance drop regularization is\nproposed to enhance the global semantic model-\ning of the dialogue context.\n•LM-12 and LM-24: Transformer-based auto-\nregressive language model with layers of 12 and\n24 respectively. No pre-training stage for these\nmodels. We only conduct the training purely\non the dialogue corpus. The sufﬁx of greedy,\nbm(b), tk(k), tp(p) denote the different decod-\ning strategies, i.e., greedy search, beam search\n(Koehn, 2004), truncated top- k sampling (Fan\net al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019b), and Nucleus\nSampling (top- p sampling) (Holtzman et al.,\n2019). b, k, and pare three hyper-parameters.\n•*-λ(Eq. 4): λis the weight of loss term for dia-\nlogue context prediction. λ0.5 and λ1 denote that\nλis 0.5 and 1 respectively. The models without\nthe term λmeans that λ= 0, i.e., only conduct\nthe response prediction given the dialogue con-\ntext.\n•BigLM-12 and BigLM-24: The language mod-\nels with both the pre-training and ﬁne-tuning\nprocedures.\n3.4 Settings\nThe length limitation of dialogue context and re-\nsponse for single-turn dialogue dataset are both 64,\nthen the maximum of the whole sequence length is\n128. For the multi-turn tasks, the length limitation\nis 300 and 64 for context and response respectively.\nLM-12 and BigLM-12 are the typical GPT-2\nmodel with 117M parameters (768 dimensions, 12\nlayers, 12 heads). LM-24 and BigLM-24 only ex-\npand the number of layers from 12 to 24, and the\ntypical 345M models (1024 dimensions, 24 layers,\n16 heads) will be evaluated and provided later.\nFor LM and BigLM models, Adam (Kingma\nand Ba, 2014) optimization method with Noam\nlearning-rate decay strategy is employed to con-\nduct the parameter learning. Validation datasets are\nused to select the appropriate models. For Seq2Seq,\nAdam with learning rate 1e-5 is utilized for train-\ning.\n4 Results and Discussions\nTable 2∼Table 6 depict the detailed evaluation\nnumbers for all the models on datasets of Weibo,\nDouban, Reddit, DailyDialog, and Persona-Chat\nrespectively. We will conduct the analysis and dis-\ncussions according to the following aspects 10:\n•Compared with the vanilla transformer-based\nSeq2Seq framework, auto-regressive language\nmodels can indeed improve the performance on\nmost of the datasets. This phenomenon is more\nclear on the multi-turn datasets of Douban, Dai-\nlyDialog, and Persona-Chat. On those datasets,\nmetric values on BLEU or BLEU-n are much\nbetter than Seq2Seq. On Weibo, LM models\nalso obtain comparable performance. However,\non Reddit dataset, Seq2Seq achieves the best\nperformance.\n•Obviously, pre-training can beneﬁt the perfor-\nmance on relevance. From the results we can ob-\nserve that the models with pre-training stage, i.e.,\nBigLM-12 and BigLM-24, obtain better BLEU\nscores than LM-12 and LM-24 on all the ﬁve\ndatasets.\n•Models with context prediction loss term (*-λ)\ncan also improve the performance, especially on\nmulti-turn dialogue scenario. From the results\non Douban, DailyDialog, and Persona-Chat we\nsee that LM-12-λ1 models are usually better than\n10There may be some shakes behind the numbers due to the\nrandom sampling issue. More robust evaluation approaches\nneed to be designed.\nthe original model LM-12 on metric of BLEU.\nAlso, LM-12- λ1 is generally better than LM-\n12-λ0.5. However, from datasets of Weibo and\nReddit, we cannot get this kind of observation\nand clue. The reason may be that long context\ncan provide more useful information than the\nsingle-turn query with only one sentence.\n•For top-k sampling decoding methods, k is a\nsensitive parameter to trade-off the relevance and\ndiversity. Large kintroduces better diversity but\ndecreases the relevance. Thus the tuning of kis\nalso an crucial issue.\n•Parameter k can affect the length of the gener-\nated response. Large kcauses longer responses.\nThe reason is that a large sampling pool will\ndecrease the opportunity of the special token\n<eos>.\n•Nucleus Sampling (top-psampling) sometimes\nobtain comparable or better performance than\ntop-ksampling. But the improvements are not\nstrong and steady.\n•CV AE and MMI are still the strong baseline\nmethods and always produce better performance\non BLEU and Distinct metrics, which demon-\nstrates that latent variable modeling and MMI\nstrategy can further improve the quality of the\ngenerated results. We believe that incorporat-\ning those strategies into the LM framework may\nfurther enhance the performance signiﬁcantly.\n5 Examples\nBigLM-24 models and top-ksampling method are\nemployed to conduct the decoding to generate the\nfollowing example results. Here k= 32. Some of\nthe example queries are extracted from the previ-\nous works (Zhang et al., 2019; Adiwardana et al.,\n2020).\nFor each input context (query)x, we can repeat it\nfor btimes (say 32) to construct a batch of queries,\nwhen we can conduct a parallel decoding approach\nand b candidate results will be generated within\none period. Then we can select the most appro-\npriate one with some ranking strategies such as\nlikelihood or mutual information. The likelihood\nranking function is deﬁned as:\nr= 2\n1\nn\n∑n\nt=1 log P(yt) (5)\n5.1 Results with Ranking Scores\nTable 7∼Table 9 and Table 10 ∼Table 12 depict\nsome examples generated by the BigLM-24 mod-\nels Reddit-Bot and Weibo-Bot respectively. These\ntwo bots are both trained for single-turn dialogue\ngeneration. The ranking scores are also provided.\nFrom the results we can observe that even the can-\ndidate results with small ranking scores can still\nconvey some relevance information for the query.\nIt seems that choose the results randomly can also\nmeet the requirement given the query.\n5.2 Results of Bot-to-Bot Interactions\nWe also conduct bot-to-bot interaction experi-\nments and the example results are described in Ta-\nble 13∼Table 15, Table 16, and Table 17∼Table 18\nfor DailyDialog-Bot, Reddit-Bot, and Douban-Bot\nrespectively. We did not setup the ending single,\nthus those two-bots can interact inﬁnite turns. We\nextract the top turns for demonstration. It should be\nnoted that, actually, no two-bots scenario settings\nin our work , we just manage a context memory\nto generate the next utterance. Therefore, we can\nobserve that the roles for A and B may interchange\nwith each other during the interactions. And the\ntopic will drift as time goes on.\n6 Conclusions\nWe present an empirical investigation of pre-trained\nTransformer-based auto-regressive language mod-\nels for the task of open-domain dialogue generation.\nTraining paradigm of pre-training and ﬁne-tuning\nis employed to conduct the parameter learning. Var-\nious of decoding strategies are employed to con-\nduct the response text generation. Extensive ex-\nperiments are conducted on the typical single-turn\nand multi-turn dialogue datasets. Detailed num-\nbers of automatic evaluation metrics on relevance\nand diversity of the generated results for the lan-\nguages models as well as the baseline approaches\nare reported.\nNevertheless, some serious issues also exist in\nthe generated results, such as the grammatical is-\nsue and the topic drift problem. More seriously,\nsometimes the bots will generate contrafactual or\noffensive content. Therefore, better model struc-\ntures, training paradigms, and decoding strategies\nneed to be investigated and constructed in the fu-\nture.\nModel Relevance Diversity LengthBLEU B-1 B-2 B-3 B-4

15: One more example of interactions between two multi-turn DailyDialog-Bots.\nSeed Query What is the meaning of life?\nResults Reddit-Bot-A: what is the meaning of life?\nReddit-Bot-B: the meaning of life ? the purpose of human existence ? like the purpose\nof love or the purpose of happiness ?\nReddit-Bot-A: life is not something you can live .\nReddit-Bot-B: that ’s why everything on the world ends when you die , and that is\nbecause you live forever . you cannot die when you die . life happens and you live\nforever .\nReddit-Bot-A: i just do n’t understand how you could think that .\nReddit-Bot-B: this is why i do n’t even consider myself a happy person .\nReddit-Bot-A: do you think life could ever be any sort of happy ending ? or just be a\nhappy happy ending ?\nReddit-Bot-B: because you die with a single soul ? and you die on a tangled web you\nca n’t move on from ?\nReddit-Bot-A: i ’m not sure . i think death will be better when everyone is able to\nsupport a human being without a child , especially in certain circumstances .\nReddit-Bot-B: he ’ll be ﬁne , he ’ll die as long as he keeps his soul around .\nReddit-Bot-A: it ’s the same as people complaining how they die or people complaining\nhow they die because they got too worked up about things .\nReddit-Bot-B: i ca n’t believe someone said that . someone has to be a complete xxx\nto you to not try .\nReddit-Bot-A: i ’m assuming he was just trying to say there ’s a difference between\ndeath and cruelty\nReddit-Bot-B: i mean its pretty obvious that he made a mistake and you ’re just mad\nbecause of it\nReddit-Bot-A: nah , he just makes up thing to sound cool as hell .\nReddit-Bot-B: no i understand it ’s a joke but it ’s sad and offensive that someone\nwould think it ’s an okay thing to do to somebody that makes fun of them .\nReddit-Bot-A: if you like his joke then you probably do n’t like the way it works in\nreal life . i would think this might be the kind of person that ’d get his audience to\nlaugh when they see you .\nReddit-Bot-B: oh , i see what you mean . the thing being fun is probably a joke . i ’m\nsorry this happened to you .\nReddit-Bot-A: what other thing happens to you ? i ca n’t tell what else you ’re talking\nabout .\nReddit-Bot-B: we ’re a bunch of kids all about fun . sometimes funny thing happens\nto people too . it ’s funny . it makes me uncomfortable\nReddit-Bot-A: just cause i have to share my story does n’t mean i do n’t have too\nmuch fun in life . i like sharing that story without having to share every part of it with\nsomeone else .\nReddit-Bot-B: my brother has this issue too ! he tells everyone he knows every week .\nReddit-Bot-A: i ’ve seen some guys go through the same thing . i know that ’s what it\nsounds like so i ’m just trying to share my story with the good ones .\nReddit-Bot-B: yea that ’s why i like it . i can get the story out of the way sometimes\nbut my best friend told him that i was going to tell him that if we talked to him .\nReddit-Bot-A: yeah , it ’s kind of hard to get what you want when everyone loves you\nso much so much . i ’m sorry for you .\nReddit-Bot-B: i ’m very sorry . it ’s not hard at all . i have a long lasting relationship\nand we ’ve been together for a long time\nReddit-Bot-A: no worries . if you ever need advice , feel free to message me and i ’ll\nanswer any questions i
