Leveraging databases such as the Materials Project\nand MatWeb, the framework retrieves and summarizes materials data with grounded,\nfactual responses—addressing a key limitation of vanilla LLMs. In cases where the\ntarget material is not found in existing databases, a generative task-specific agent can\npropose plausible crystal structures.

Designing\nsuch materials is a complex and iterative process that requires deep domain expertise and\nadvanced computational techniques. As a result, researchers are increasingly leveraging com-\nputational tools to predict and optimize material behavior, accelerating the development of\nmaterials with targeted functionalities. 1,2\nThis shift has driven the creation of large-scale materials databases—including the Ma-\nterials Project, 3 MatWeb,4 OQMD,5 and ICSD6—which serve as critical resources for data-\ndriven materials discovery. Predictive models built on these databases are increasingly used\nto guide materials design decisions. 7 In particular, generative models—machine learning al-\ngorithms that learn patterns from data to generate new, plausible candidates—are being\nadopted to propose novel material compositions or structures, further accelerating discov-\nery.8–10 However, despite these advancements, integrating various simulation tools and data\n2\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zkn81-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0370-4212 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0\nsources into a unified framework remains a significant challenge. This lack of integration\nlimits the seamless use of computational resources and hinders the pace of innovation in\nmaterials design. 11\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence—especially the emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs)—have reshaped how researchers engage with complex data and derive sci-\nentific insights. Built on transformer architectures, 12 these models excel at understanding\nand generating natural language through self-attention mechanisms, enabling scalable pro-\ncessing of language-based information. LLMs, such as OpenAI’s GPT models, 13,14 Meta’s\nLLaMA,15 and Anthropic’s Claude, 16 have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in inter-\npreting user queries, synthesizing information from diverse sources, and producing actionable\ninsights. In the context of materials science, LLMs support tasks such as information ex-\ntraction from large databases, literature mining, and hypothesis generation. Their ability to\nprocess unstructured natural language queries allows researchers to intuitively explore com-\nplex datasets, reducing manual effort and accelerating scientific workflows.17–19 Additionally,\ntransformer-based language models have proven effective as encoders for property prediction\ntasks across a range of scientific domains, including metal-organic frameworks,20 polymers,21\ncatalysis,18,19 proteins,22–25 inorganic crystals, 26,27 and additive manufacturing. 28\nLLMs are now being integrated into agentic frameworks that extend their utility from pas-\nsive query interpretation to active scientific problem-solving.29,30 These LLM agents leverage\nthe model’s language understanding, pre-trained knowledge, and emerging planning abilities\nto autonomously perform complex tasks. For instance, Boiko et al. introduced Coscientist,\nan LLM-driven agent that automates experimental design and execution, substantially re-\nducing manual effort. 31 Similarly, ChemCrow combines LLMs with chemistry-specific tools\nto support synthesis planning and materials discovery. 32 Such agentic systems are being\napplied across diverse scientific domains, including not only materials science and chemistry\nbut also fields like 3D printing and engineering design. 33,34\nWhile LLMs demonstrate strong capabilities in natural language processing and gen-\n3\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zkn81-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0370-4212 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0\neral reasoning, their application in specialized scientific domains such as materials science\npresents several challenges. One of the most significant concerns is hallucination, where\nLLMs produce information that appears plausible but is factually incorrect. 35–37 Such out-\nputs can mislead researchers, disrupt workflows, and lead to wasted resources. This issue is\nparticularly problematic when interpreting technical datasets, as LLMs are typically trained\non general-purpose corpora that lack sufficient coverage of domain-specific materials science\nknowledge.38,39\nFurthermore, LLMs alone are inherently limited in delivering rigorous scientific predic-\ntions for complex physical phenomena, as such tasks require high-precision, physics-based\nsimulations and validated numerical methods. To overcome this limitation, LLMs must be\nintegrated with domain-specific scientific software, enabling them to function as user proxies\nthat automate the setup and execution of simulation workflows. Several hybrid frameworks\nhave emerged to support this vision—LLaMP, 40 HoneyComb,41 and AtomAgents42—which\ncouple LLMs with scientific tools and databases. LLaMP and HoneyComb primarily function\nas retrieval agents, leveraging data sources like the Materials Project, arXiv, and Wikipedia.\nAtomAgents is a more specialized system designed to support alloy development through\nintegration with multimodal perception, reasoning capability, and materials design tools. As\nresearch continues, there is a growing need for a more generalizable and modular framework\nthat can accommodate a broader range of materials systems and simulation tasks, while\nremaining flexible enough to incorporate newly developed computational tools.\nWe propose MatSciAgent, a multi-agent framework that integrates an LLM with spe-\ncialized computational tools to perform tasks based on natural language user queries. As\nillustrated in Figure 1, the system supports four task types: materials retrieval, continuum\nsimulation, crystal structure generation, and molecular dynamics simulation. Each task is\nhandled by a dedicated task-specific agent, coordinated by a central master agent. The\nmaster agent interprets the user’s input, determines the type of task, and delegates the\nquery to the appropriate task-specific agent. The assigned agent then selects the relevant\n4\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zkn81-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0370-4212 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

Built on OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo, it employs\ncustomized prompts for domain-specific reasoning and tool integration. The modular ar-\nchitecture supports diverse tasks, including data extraction, continuum simulations, crystal\nstructure generation, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ensuring easy expansion\nwith new agents, tools, or workflows.\nEach individual agent is powered by an LLM, equipped with task-specific tools, and oper-\nates with shared memory supported by a scratchpad, as shown in Figure 2. A key strength is\nits agentic design, where each agent operates independently and is equipped with specialized\ntools and prompts. Shared memory maintains context, enabling iterative problem-solving.\nThe LLM serves as the reasoning layer, dynamically interpreting queries and orchestrating\ntool use. By combining LLM-driven reasoning with the precision of computation tools, the\nsystem can handle complex queries, perform precise calculations, and generate analyzable\ninsights.\nPrompt engineering and structured tool integration enhance adaptability. Carefully de-\nsigned prompts define each agent’s operations, while integrated tools handle specialized\ncomputations like MD simulations or property data extraction. The LLM remains focused\non reasoning and decision-making while delegating computationally intensive operations to\nthese tools. A centralized execution framework manages input parsing, tool invocation, and\nresponse formatting, ensuring seamless interaction between the LLM’s reasoning and the\ntools’ deterministic computations.\nMaterials Extraction\nLLMs, while powerful, are typically trained on general-purpose natural language datasets and\nlack access to the specialized, structured data required for materials science applications.43,44\nBecause they rely on static, pre-trained knowledge, they cannot dynamically query authori-\ntative databases, often resulting in outdated or incomplete information.

The final result is produced once no further tool\ninvocations are required.\nprobabilistic nature can lead to overgeneralization or misinterpretation of complex scientific\nqueries.45\nTo overcome these limitations, we introduce a materials extraction agent that integrates\nthe Materials Project API and custom web-scraping for MatWeb, enabling real-time access\nto validated, domain-specific data. Upon receiving a user query, the agent retrieves relevant\nmaterial properties—such as thermal, dielectric, and surface characteristics—by invoking\nthe appropriate database call, either via API or web scraping. It then synthesizes a natural\nlanguage response based on the retrieved data. This method ensures that responses are\ngrounded in current, authoritative sources, allowing for more accurate contextualization of\nmaterials, verification of properties under specific conditions, and delivery of reliable, data-\ndriven insights critical for real-world applications. Importantly, by relying on scientifically\n7\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zkn81-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0370-4212 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

MatWeb complements this with experimentally validated material data, enabling direct\ncomparisons between computational predictions and empirical behavior. Further implemen-\ntation details are provided in the Methods section.\nContinuum Simulation\nThe continuum simulation agent executes advanced materials science simulations, integrating\ntwo key modeling techniques: Cellular Automata (CA) 46,47 for phase transformations and\nMonte Carlo Annealing (MCA) 48,49 for microstructural evolution during annealing. Users\nprovide simulation conditions in natural language, which the agent translates into actionable\nparameters before executing the simulation.\nThe CA tool models phase transformations such as solidification and recrystallization\nby iteratively updating a 2D grid based on local neighborhood conditions. It accounts for\nattachment probabilities and tracks transformed regions over time, offering insights into\ngrain growth and nucleation in both single-phase and multiphase systems.\nMCA tool, using the Potts model, 50 simulates the evolution of the grain structure under\nannealing conditions. Operating near zero temperature, it employs three biasing strategies:\nunbiased selection, neighboring flavor selection, and interface bias selection to model inter-\nface and bulk site behaviors. This method enables a detailed analysis of grain boundary\ndynamics and energy minimization during thermal processing, offering predictive insights\ninto microstructural stability.\nUnderstanding phase transformations and microstructural evolution is essential for tai-\nloring material properties in manufacturing and processing. By integrating CA and MCA\nwithin an LLM framework, it enhances traditional modeling tools with natural language in-\n8\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zkn81-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0370-4212 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

It delivers actionable insights through\nsimulation results.\nCrystal Structure Generation\nAtomic structure is fundamental to understanding inorganic crystal materials and performing\ncomputational simulations. When structural data is available in existing datasets, it can be\ndirectly retrieved. However, if such data is missing, alternative methods are needed to\ngenerate the desired atomic structures.\nThe crystal generator agent addresses this by generating crystal structures based on\nelemental compositions or alloy systems using CrystaLLM, a transformer-based language\nmodel specifically designed to produce CIFs (Crystallographic Information Files) of inor-\nganic crystals. 8 Upon receiving a user query, the agent extracts relevant information and\nruns CrystaLLM to generate plausible inorganic crystal structures. It can produce multiple\ncandidate structures for a given composition, enabling material exploration.\nUnlike general-purpose LLMs, CrystaLLM is tailored to recognize complex crystallo-\ngraphic patterns, enabling the generation of physically realistic structures. As part of a\nmulti-agent system, the crystal generator agent streamlines materials workflows by providing\nimmediate input for downstream tasks such as thermodynamic stability analysis, property\nprediction, and MD simulations.\nMolecular Dynamics\nAtomic-scale simulations are essential for understanding fundamental material behaviors,\nsuch as thermal conductivity, mechanical strength, and phase transitions. 51,52 The MD sim-\nulation agent is designed to automate and streamline atomic-scale simulations. It interprets\nuser input queries, sets up the appropriate simulation parameters, and executes the MD sim-\nulation accordingly. Specifically, the agent initializes atomic structures, defines interatomic\npotentials, and runs simulations using tools primarily based on the Atomic Simulation En-\n9\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zkn81-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0370-4212 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

The agent can also perform simu-\nlations under different thermodynamic ensembles—NVE (constant energy), NVT (constant\ntemperature), and NPT (constant pressure)—allowing users to explore material behavior\nunder controlled conditions. Further details are provided in the Methods section. By trans-\nlating natural language input into simulation-ready parameters, the agent simplifies the MD\nsimulation workflow.\nIntegrating the MD simulation tools with an LLM agent significantly enhances its capabil-\nities. Users can interactively configure simulations, analyze results, and visualize atomic tra-\njectories using natural language queries. Unlike traditional standalone MD tools, this agent\nautomates the entire workflow—from structure initialization to result interpretation—providing\nactionable outputs such as energy plots and trajectory data with minimal manual effort.\nCase Study\nMaterials Extraction\nCase 1. Synthesis of Perovskite Oxides for Solar Cells\nThe task begins with the user query: “Provide synthesis details for perovskite oxides used in\nsolar cells.” A comparison between the materials extraction agent and the vanilla GPT-3.5-\nturbo is summarized in Figure 3. The materials extraction agent first identifies key terms\nfrom the query—namely “perovskite” and “solar cells” —using its reasoning capabilities. It\nthen invokes the materialsproject API to retrieve relevant data from the database. This\napproach enables the agent to deliver more specific and detailed information than the vanilla\n10\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zkn81-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0370-4212 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

Bonding Information for TiO 2\nThe user input query in this task specifies a particular material and requested properties,\nsuch as: “Retrieve bond length and coordination information for TiO 2. List your results.”\nThe agent first identifies the task as a material/property extraction query and summarizes\nthe retrieved information, as shown in Figure 4. In this case, the target material is TiO 2,\nand the properties of interest are bond lengths and coordination environments. Because\nTiO2 exists in multiple structural forms—each associated with a unique material ID—the\nagent begins by retrieving all relevant material IDs. It then uses a set of tools to extract the\nbonding properties for each structure.\nBecause the agent has access to the Materials Project database, it generates response\nprompts based on real, up-to-date data. In contrast, the vanilla GPT-3.5-turbo relies solely\non its pre-trained knowledge, without access to external sources. Although only one summary\nis shown below for illustration, the agent produces a separate summary for each retrieved\nstructure, ensuring thorough coverage of all known structural variants of the material.\nCase 3: Materials within a Specific Heat Capacity Range\nThe user query specifies a target property range—specific heat capacities between 0.1 and\n2.0 J/g·◦C—along with additional guidelines, such as ensuring material diversity and priori-\ntizing experimentally verified data (Figure5a). The agent begins by identifying the property\nof interest and its specified range, then queries the MatWeb database to retrieve relevant\nmaterials and generates a structured response (Figure 5b).

Each cell in\nthe grid represents a point in space and can exist either in the liquid phase, denoted by 0, or\nin one of several solid phases, represented by positive integers. The transformation process\nis driven by local interactions between neighboring cells and governed by an attachment\nprobability, allowing the model to effectively capture the evolution of microstructures during\nphase changes.\nThe model is defined by several key parameters. The width specifies the size of the\nsquare simulation grid, and the simulation is restricted to the interior cells to avoid boundary\neffects. The attach prob parameter controls the likelihood that a liquid cell will transform\ninto a solid phase based on its neighbors. When this value is set to 1, the transformation\nis deterministic, while lower values introduce randomness, resulting in probabilistic growth\nbehavior. The num solid states parameter determines how many distinct solid phases can\nexist in the system. When set to 1, the model simulates basic solidification with a single\ngrowing phase; when greater than 1, it enables more complex recrystallization scenarios,\nwhere multiple phases grow and compete for space.\nNucleation is introduced through the place nuclei(num nuclei) function, which ran-\ndomly places a specified number of initial solid cells throughout the grid. Each nucleus\nis assigned a random solid phase. The system then evolves over a series of discrete time\nsteps using the evolve(Nsteps) function, which updates each cell based on the states of its\nneighbors.\nThe output of the simulation includes visual snapshots of the evolving microstructure\nat each time step, as well as a plot showing the fraction of the transformed area over time.\nThis transformation curve can be compared to analytical predictions based on the Johnson-\n22\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zkn81-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0370-4212 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY-NC 4.0\nMehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) theory, 57 providing a means of validating the model’s\nbehavior.\nMonte Carlo Annealing\nMonte Carlo Annealing is used to simulate grain growth or spin ordering in a two-dimensional\nPotts model at very low temperatures ( T ≈ 0), where the system dynamics are governed\nprimarily by energy minimization. 49 This corresponds to zero-temperature Metropolis dy-\nnamics, in which spin flips are only accepted if they lower or maintain the system’s energy.\nEach site on the 2D lattice can exist in one of Q possible states, and the system evolves by\nlocally minimizing interfacial energy between different states.\nThe model is characterized by several key parameters. The variableQ defines the number\nof possible states or “flavors” per lattice site, which can represent, for example, distinct grain\norientations in a polycrystalline material. The parameter L sets the size of the square lattice,\nresulting in a total of L×L sites. The simulation proceeds for a given number of Monte Carlo\nsteps, with each step consisting of L2 spin-flip attempts. The biasing strategy determines\nhow both the site and the trial state are selected during simulation. Strategies include\nselecting a random new state from all Q options, choosing from neighboring states at any\nsite, or restricting to neighboring states only at interfacial sites (i.e., those bordering unlike\nneighbors).\nThis simulation produces several outputs that help analyze the system’s behavior. The\nenergy history tracks how the total energy of the lattice evolves over time, typically decreasing\nas the system anneals. The acceptance history records the number of accepted spin flips per\nMonte Carlo step, providing insight into how active or “frozen” the system becomes during\nthe simulation. The configuration history stores snapshots of the lattice at each step, allowing\nvisualization of the evolving microstructure and phase ordering. If plotting is enabled, the\nsimulation also generates visualizations of the energy curve, acceptance rate, and both initial\nand final configurations. Additionally, it can save all configuration snapshots as images in a\n23\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zkn81-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0370-4212 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

Built on the GPT-2 architecture and adapted using\nthe nanoGPT implementation, 58,59 CrystaLLM has been purposefully trained for applica-\ntions in inorganic materials science. Rather than relying on general-purpose vocabularies, it\nuses a custom byte-level tokenizer with a vocabulary of 371 tokens tailored to the syntactic\npatterns of CIF files.\nThe training dataset for CrystaLLM was assembled from multiple high-quality mate-\nrials science databases, including the Materials Project, 3 the Open Quantum Materials\nDatabase,5 and the NOMAD. 60 These sources provide a diverse range of inorganic crys-\ntal structures, enabling the model to learn detailed patterns related to atomic arrangements,\nsymmetry operations, and lattice parameters across a wide variety of crystal systems.\nWe employ the small variant of CrystaLLM in our study, which consists of 8 transformer\nlayers, each with 8 attention heads and a context window of 1,024 tokens. The model has\nan embedding dimension of 512 and was trained from scratch for 5,000 iterations.\nMolecular Dynamics Simulation\nMD simulations were conducted using the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) to inves-\ntigate the structural evolution of atomic systems under various thermodynamic conditions.\nThe agentic framework enables the execution of MD simulations in NVE (constant energy),\nNVT (constant Number, Volume, Temperature), and NPT (constant Number, Pressure,\nTemperature) ensembles. Thermodynamic control was achieved using the Berendsen ther-\nmostat for temperature regulation and the Berendsen barostat for pressure regulation in\nNPT simulations.\nKey simulation parameters include the time step for numerical integration, target tem-\n24\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zkn81-v2 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0370-4212 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

For ensemble control, the thermostat and\nbarostat time constants were specified, along with external pressure and barostat coupling\nstrength for NPT conditions. Additionally, a logging interval was defined to record system\nproperties and trajectories at regular time steps. Simulation outputs consist of atomic tra-\njectories saved in .traj format, log files detailing the evolution of energy, temperature, and\nstress, and corresponding visualizations of energy and temperature profiles over time.\nData and Software Availability\nThe necessary code used in this study can be accessed at https://github.com/cakshat/\nMatSci-LLM-Agents.\nReferences\n(1) Pollice, R.; dos Passos Gomes, G.; Aldeghi, M.; Hickman, R.
