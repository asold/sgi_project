The\nconditions for obtaining the maximum yield of the ester were optimized. The yield was 93.3% (v/v) at\nreaction time of 24 h, catalyst concentration of 4.5 wt% and methanol to oil volume ratio of 6 : 1.\nMESSO was characterized by adopting TG-DTA and FT-IR methods. The physical, chemical and electrical\nproperties were measured as per International Standards for assessing its suitability as an insulating liquid\nin transformers. The kinematic viscosity of the ester is 0.98/C2 10\n/C0 11 mm2 S/C0 1, which is far less than the\nviscosity of the raw oil. The low acid/neutralization value (0.001 mg of KOH per g) for MESSO oﬀers high\noxidation stability. The high ﬂash point (260 /C14 C) and ﬁre point (345 /C14 C) values of MESSO provide\noperational safety to the transformers when they are ﬁlled with the developed insulating ﬂuid. The\nsaturated fatty acid content in MESSO provides a high thermal and oxidation stability for the\ntransformers. The high dielectric constant values for MESSO in comparison to the mineral oil are\nattributed to the polar groups present in the ester. These results conﬁrm that MESSO can be developed\nas an alternative to mineral oils for insulation and cooling in transformers. MESSO has merits of low cost,\nbio-degradability, ecofriendliness and preparation from renewable sources.\nIntroduction\nThe phenomenal increase in the use of petroleum-based oils as\nfuels and insulating liquids in transformers throughout the\nglobe has led to the extensive exploration of the present oil\ndeposits.\n1 The naturally existing petroleum sources are rapidly\ndepleting. Researchers are trying to nd alternatives from\nrenewable plant kingdom sources. Vegetable or crop-based oils\nor their derivatives possessing optimum amounts of unsatura-\ntion that meet the technical requirements of conventional\npetroleum-based oils are being investigated. The vegetable/\ncrop-based oils, contrary to existing petroleum-based or\nsynthetic oils, are biodegradable and eco-friendly as they are\nderived from natural and renewable resources.\n2\nSuch oils can be produced from various sources such as\nedible oil,3 non-edible oil,4 animal fat5 and algae.6 About 95% of\nworldwide biodiesel production is derived from edible oils.7\nHowever, it has been strongly opposed by non-government\norganizations worldwide as the edible oil resources for human\nconsumption are proportionally depleting.\n8 Hence, exploring\nthe utility of non-edible oils for the specic purpose of insu-\nlating the transformers without disturbing the prevailing eco-\nfriendly systems endowed in nature is a progressive aspect of\nresearch. The replacement of mineral-based oil with non-edible\noils or their derivatives will reduce the production cost and\nlower the rate of pollution.\n9\nThis aspect of research is not new. Natural oils such as caster\noil, hydrogenated caster oil, cottonseed oil, and coconut oil\nwere used in capacitors before 1990.10 A patent for the use of\nsoybean oil with some additives in the capacitor has been\nissued in 1985.\n11 Since 1990, much interest has been envisaged\nby researchers in rapeseed oil as transformer oil as it is not an\nedible oil and available in many countries, and hence needs\ncommercial utility.\n12 Bertrand et al.13 probed vegetable oils,\nnamely, castor oil, rapeseed and sunower oils as substitutes\nfor mineral oils in medium voltage equipment and found that\nthe AC breakdown voltages of these oils was far superior to that\nof conventional mineral oils. Hosieret al.14 studied a wide range\nof vegetable oils under controlled laboratory aging. The result-\ning aged oils were characterized by a number of analytical\ntechniques. Kohtohet al.investigated the eﬀect of aging on the\nelectrical properties of the insulating liquid in eld trans-\nformers.\n15 Al-Amin et al. probed the use of a silicone-based\nsynthetic ester as an insulating uid in transformers and\naDepartment of Chemistry, Koneru Lakshmaiah Educational Foundation, Green Fields,\nVaddeswaram – 522 502, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh, India.

The experimental results revealed that 130\n/C14 C was the\nproposed stable operating temperature for oxidation under\nsealed conditions. 21 Sitorus et al. assessed the insulation\ncapacity of Jatropha curcas methyl ester oil (JMEO) in compar-\nison with MO by the streamers phenomenon and found that\nJMEO could be used as a better alternative to MO for high\nvoltage power transformers.\n22 Tokunaga et al. compared the\ndielectric properties of aged natural esters namely, palm fatty\nacid ester (PFAE) and FR3 with mineral oil and found that PFAE\nshowed the highest BDV compared with that of the remaining\ntwo dielectric uids.\n23 Villarroel et al. evaluated the moisture\ndiﬀusion coeﬃcient parameters for two natural esters, namely,\nBIOTEMP and BIOELECTRA. The results revealed the applica-\nbility of moisture dynamics during transformer operation.\n24 The\nexperimental analysis of Mariprasath et al. revealed that the\nmeasured physical, chemical and electrical properties of Kar-\nanja oil were comparable to those of MO.\n25\nThe present investigation was aimed to identify a seed that is\navailable widely in India and not used for human or animal\nconsumption (in one form or other) and to investigate the\nadaptability of the simple esters in the oil extracted from the\nseeds for transformer insulation. To our knowledge, no\nsuccessful attempts have been made so far to identify proper\nseeds available in India whose oils or their derivatives are\nsuitable for use in transformers. We have identied Sesbania\nseeds (Avisa-in Telugu) for this purpose. In the present inves-\ntigation, Sesbania seed oil was converted to methyl esters and\nthe obtained methyl ester was characterized for its physical,\nchemical and electrical properties to determine its suitability as\na liquid dielectric in distribution transformers as per the\nInternational Standards.\nExperimental\nPlant description\nAvisa (in Telugu) or Sesbania grandiora is commonly called\na hummingbird tree. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and\ngrows to a height of 10–15 m with a trunk diameter of about\n30 cm, as shown in Fig. 1(a). It is cultivated for wood and for its\nseeds, from which oil is obtained. Its origin is India and\ncosmopolitan in distribution. Itourishes in all climates and\ngrows economically in a number of countries around the world,\nincluding Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Philippines, and Myanmar. The\ntrees bear pods that are 20–60 cm long with broad sutures\ncontaining 15–50 seeds, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The seeds are\ndark brown in color and typically about 3 to 4 mm long, as\nshown in Fig. 1(c), and contain 30% to 40% oil by weight. The\npotential yield of the seeds is about 500 kg to 1000 kg ha\n/C0 1. The\noil is more viscous than other vegetable oils. Therefore, the oil is\nused in the production of varnishes, printing inks, and paints.\nSynthesis of ester\nThe seeds were collected, washed with distilled water and air\ndried. The seeds were then subjected to mechanical crushers to\nobtain oil. The obtained oil wasltered, rened and used for\ntransesterication.\nPurication of oil\nThe seed oil was rened by treating the oil with alkali to remove\nthe free fatty acids. This was achieved by adding sodium\nhydroxide to the oil sample by heating to about 60\n/C14 C for an\nhour and then centrifuging the sample for a few minutes. Then,\nthe impurities that settled at the bottom were discarded. The\npuried oil was then subjected to a bleaching process to remove\nany undesirable coloring materials (other than its natural color)\npresent in the oil. This was done by treating the oil sample with\nactivated carbon derived from the barks of theFicus racemosa\nplant for an interval of 30 minutes under agitation. For the\npreparation of activated carbon, the barks of theFicus racemosa\nplant were collected, carbonized at 650\n/C14 C and activated\nchemically by treatment with HNO 3, as described in our\nprevious publication.26 The bleached oil wasltered and sub-\njected to a winterization or de-waxing process for removing the\nfrozen saturated fats. For this purpose, the oil was cooled to\na freezing temperature (<0\n/C14 C) and the fats settled as crystals.\nThese crystals were removed byltration. The obtained rened,\nbleached and winterized oil sample was trans-esteried to form\nesters. The scheme of purication of oil is presented in Fig. 2.\nTrans-esterication\nFor the transesterication process, a known quantity (100 mL)\nof oil sample was mixed with a known quantity (600 mL) of\nmethanol (in the ratio of 1 : 6).27 To this blend, 4.5 mL of conc.\nH2SO4 (catalyst) was added. Then, the mixture was reuxed at\na temperature of 50/C14 C for 24 h. Aer 24 h of reuxing, the ester\nwas formed and the mixture was poured into a separating\nFig. 1 (a) Sesbania grandiﬂora plant, (b) Sesbania seed pods and (c)\nSesbania seeds.\n3312 | RSC Adv.,2 0 1 9 ,9,3 3 1 1–3319 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nRSC Advances Paper\nOpen Access Article.

The contents were le overnight for separation. Two\nlayers were formed. The lower layer contained glycerol and the\nupper layer contained the methyl ester of the Sesbania oil\n(MESSO). The lower layer was discarded and the upper layer was\nmixed with hot water to remove the excess catalyst and un-\nreacted methanol. Again two layers were formed; the lower\nlayer was an aqueous layer, which was removed. This washing\nprocess was repeated 3 to 4 times until the lower layer was clear.\nThe scheme for the trans-esterication of the oil is presented in\nFig. 3. The upper ester layer was centrifuged for a few minutes to\nremove any water content present in the ester. Aer centrifu-\ngation, the oil layer, if formed, was separated from the aqueous\nlayer. The various parameters aﬀecting the yield were optimized\nfor obtaining a higher% of the ester. The obtained sample was\nsubjected to characterization.\nCharacterization\nThe fatty acid prole for raw Sesbania oil was determined using\nthe GC-HRMS instrument having an FID detector (Jeol; model\nACCuTOF GCV) following the standard procedure as per EN\n14103 standard.\n29 The identied fatty acid peaks at various\nretention times were compared with the retention times of the\nstandards. The measurements were repeated three times and\nthe obtained average values were used for further studies. The\nGC-MS spectra of raw Sesbania oil are shown in Fig. 5. Based on\nthe spectra, the % compositions of diﬀerent fatty acids were\ncalculated and presented in Tables 2 and 3.\nMESSO was characterized using TGD-DGA and FTIR spec-\ntroscopy studies. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed\nusing a TGA-DTA Thermal Analyser (Diamond TG-DTA, Perkin\nElmer, USA) under air at a temperature range of 50–500\n/C14 C and\nheating rate of 5/C14 C min/C0 1.

The moisture content for MESSO and\nmineral oil was measured using the Karl Fischer titration\nmethod according to IS 13567:1992. The acid or neutralization\nvalues for the oil sample and MESSO were measured as a total\nacid number according to IS 1448 [P:2]:1967.\nThe dielectric strength of MESSO was measured as per IS\n6792:1972. This was determined by using a motorized oil test\nset (SEV). Theash and re points for MESSO were measured\nusing a Pensky–Martin closed cup apparatus according to IS\n1448(P: 2)-1992.\n28 The tan d values, specic resistance values,\ndielectric constants and dielectric loss factors of MESSO were\nmeasured by performing broadband spectroscopy at the\nfrequency range from 1 Hz to MHz. All the observed values\nalong with the International Standard limit values are presented\nin Tables 4 and 5.\nFactors aﬀecting the yield of ester, MESSO\nAt the end of each run, the volumetric MESSO yield was calcu-\nlated from the equation\n% Volume yield¼\nfinal volume\ninitial volume/C2 100\nEﬀect of reaction time\nContact time is an important factor that aﬀects the rate of the\ntrans-esterication process. The e ﬀect of time on trans-\nesterication was studied by varying the reaction time from 1\nto 30 h at a constant temperature of 50/C6 1 /C14 C, stirring speed of\n400 rpm, 4.5 wt% of catalyst, conc. H2SO4 loading and 6 : 1\nmethanol-to-oil ratio. The results are presented in Fig. 4(a).\nFrom the Fig. 4(a), it is noted that the rate of trans-esterication\nis slow at the beginning of the reaction and reached to\na maximum yield of 93.3% (v/v) at 24 h of reaction time and\nthen, the yield decreased. The initial slowness of the reaction is\nattributed to the mixing and dispersion of alcohol into the oil\nand the slow mass transfer in the reaction mixture. When the\ntime was varied from 15 h to 24 h, the rate of reaction increased\nand the yield enhanced from 65.5% (v/v) to 93.3% (v/v). The fall\nof yield when the reaction time was more than 24 h Thisnding\nwas attributed to the reversed reaction for the trans-\nesterication, resulting in more soap generation and the loss\nof the ester. These observations coincide with well-known\nchemical principles.\nEﬀect of catalyst loading\nTo study the eﬀect of catalyst loading, the amount of catalyst\nwas varied from 0.5 to 10 wt% with respect to oil weight under\nthe following optimum reaction conditions: methanol-to-oil\nvolume ratio, 6 : 1 (v/v); temperature, 50 /C6 1\n/C14 C; stirring\nspeed, 400 rpm; time, 24 h. These observations are presented in\nFig. 4(b). It was inferred from Fig. 4(b) that the rate of reaction\nincreased with the increase in the catalyst amount from 0.5 to\n5 wt%, and a maximum yield of 93.3% (v/v) MESSO was ach-\nieved with the catalyst amount of 4.5 wt%, aer which it became\nconstant.\n30 This nding was attributed to the increase in the\nactive sites with an increase in the amount of catalyst till steady\nstate was reached. When all the active sites were used up, the\nrate of reaction became constant.\n31\nEﬀect of the oil to methanol volume ratio\nThe eﬀect of the methanol to oil volume ratio was studied by\nvarying the methanol-to-oil volume ratio from 1 : 1 to 12 : 1,\nkeeping the other operating conditions at optimum levels. The\nndings are noted in Table 1. It is inferred from the table that as\nthe content of methanol increases, the % yield of MESSO\nincreases up to the volume ratio of 6 : 1, and any further\nincrease in methanol volume adversely aﬀects the yield. To\nincrease the dissolution of oil in methanol, a higher amount of\nmethanol is required.\n32 The conversion of triglycerides from\nfatty acids to glycerol and methyl esters required three steps:\nconversion of triglycerides to di-glycerides, di-glycerides to\nmono-glycerides and nally mono-glycerides to free glycerol\nand methyl esters.\n33 All these steps are reversible reactions and\nto achieve higher yields, higher content of methanol is needed\nto shi the reaction for more formation of esters.\n34 However,\nwhen the content of methanol is very high, trans-esterication\nis adversely aﬀected. This is attributed to the fact that as the\ncontent of methanol increases, the polarity of the reaction\nmixture increases and this results in an increase in the solu-\nbility of glycerol in the ester layer. Moreover, the higher\npercentage of methanol dilutes the activity of the catalyst by\nFig. 7 FTIR spectrum of MESSO.\nTable 1 Eﬀect of methanol to oil volume ratio on the % yield\nS. no.\nMethanol to oil\nvolume ratio\n% Yield\nof the ester\n1 1 : 1 15.5\n2 2 : 1 28.9\n3 4 : 1 62.5\n4 6 : 1 93.3\n5 8 : 1 59.0\n6 10 : 1 38.7\n7 12 : 1 22.4\n3314\n| RSC Adv.,2 0 1 9 ,9, 3311–3319 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019\nRSC Advances Paper\nOpen Access Article.

The degree\nof unsaturation (DU) for the raw Sesbania oil and MESSO was\ncalculated using the following equation: Degree of unsaturation\n(DU) ¼ (monounsaturated C\nn: 1, wt%) + 2(polyunsaturated Cn:\n2, wt%) + 5(polyunsaturated Cn: 5, wt%).39 The results are pre-\nsented in Table 3.\nFrom the tables, it is seen that the saturated fatty acid\ncontent in Sesbania oil was 26.99 wt%, which imparted higher\noxidative and thermal stabilities, leading to a slower deterio-\nration rate for the lipid characteristics.\n40,41 This tendency makes\nMESSO a good insulating uid in transformers to withstand\nhigh-temperature environments or long-term storage\nconditions.\nTG-DTA\nTG-DTA analysis was used to estimate the nature and number of\nconstituents present in the ester sample. The TGA data depicted\nin Fig. 6 shows that thermal decomposition occurred in a single\nstage. This indicates that MESSO was thermally stable. As the\ntemperature increased from 50 to 100\n/C14 C, no signicant loss in\nthe wt% of the sample was observed, which conrmed the that\nless moisture content was present in the sample and 97 wt% of\nthe sample was retained until 200/C14 C. Aer 200 /C14 C, thermal\ndecomposition slowly initiated and became signicant aer\n250 /C14 C. At 261/C14 C, the wt% loss was about 73%. This result was\nattributed to theash point of MESSO, which was always less\nthan the nal decomposition temperature. A substantial mass\nloss from 73% to 100% in the temperature range from 261/C14 Ct o\n345 /C14 C is observed. Complete decomposition of the sample was\nnoted at 345 /C14 C, indicating the re point of MESSO. These\nresults conrmed the purity of the sample and its thermal\nstability. The corresponding DTA results are also shown in\nFig. 6. These results conrm the endothermic nature of the\nsample and infer that MESSO can be used as the insulatinguid\nin transformers.\nFTIR\nThe IR spectrum of MESSO (Fig. 7) shows various peaks per-\ntaining to an ester, conrming the formation of an ester. The\nabsorption peak at 3007 cm\n/C0 1 is attributed to–OH groups.36 The\nabsorption peaks at 2927 and 1436 cm/C0 1 are attributed to the\nsymmetric and anti-symmetric vibrations of–CH2 groups.

The results\nobtained are plotted as the shear ratevs. viscosity in Fig. 8. It is\nobserved that the dynamic viscosity of MESSO (0.82/C2 10\n/C0 2 Pa s)\nis less than that of the pure oil (7.4/C2 10/C0 2 Pa s) at a shear rate of\n110 S/C0 1.\nFrom the values of dynamic viscosity, kinematic viscosities\nof the oil and MESSO were calculated based on the formula:\nKinematic viscocity ¼ dynamic viscocity\ndensityðrÞ\nThe kinematic viscosity for MESSO was 0.98/C2 10/C0 11 mm2\nS/C0 1, which was far less than that of Sesbania oil (9.48/C2 10/C0 11\nmm2 S/C0 1). The major reason for the viscosity reduction was the\ntransformation of triglycerides to methyl esters. MESSO was\ninduced to ow easily at a low viscosity.\n37 This nding fullls\none of the important conditions for MESSO for its suitability as\nan insulatinguid in transformers.\nDensity. The density of MESSO was found to be 0.84 g cm\n/C0 3,\nwhich was within the permitted International Standard value of\n0.89 g cm/C0 3.\nInterfacial tension. The interfacial tension between the\ninterface of water and oil is a way to measure the molecular\nattractive forces between water and oil. It is measured in newton\nper meter or dyne percm. This value is useful for determining\nthe presence of polar contaminants and oil decay products.\nFresh oil generally exhibits high interfacial tension. The present\nMESSO has interfacial tension of 0.038 N m\n/C0 1, which was\ncomparable to the International Standard value of 0.04 N m/C0 1\n(Table 4).\nFlash and re points. Flashpoint is one of the most impor-\ntant variables used to characterize the re and explosion\nhazards of liquids.

It is noted from the table\nthat theash point of 260/C14 C andre point of 345/C14 C for MESSO\nare within the International Standards for transformer oils.\nChemical parameters\nMoisture content. The moisture content present in MESSO\nand conventional mineral oil was measured at various\ntemperatures ranging from 40–120\n/C14 C using the Karl Fischer\ntitration method. The observations are presented in Fig. 9 as\n‘Temperature vs. moisture content’. It is observed from the\ngure that the moisture content decreases with the increase in\nthe temperature for both MESSO and mineral oil (MO).\nKra paper and pressboard were used for solid insulation in\nthe transformers. These comprised\nD-glucose monomers, which\nwere polymerized to form cellulose. If the % of moisture content\nis more in the transformer oil, the degradation of the cellulose\npolymer and the reduction of the dielectric strength occurs. The\nmoisture content of MESSO was found to be 35 ppm at 40\n/C14 C,\nwhich was within the permitted International Standard limit of\n<50 ppm. Therefore, MESSO satis ed another important\ncondition for transformer oils.\nAcid/neutralization value. The degree of purity, aging and\nquality for the oil upon storage were indicated by the acid/\nneutralization value.\n38 The acid/neutralization value for the oil\nand MESSO was measured as per the International Standards.\nThe values are presented in Table 5. It is noted from the table\nthat the acid value for MESSO (0.001 mg of KOH g/C0 1) was far less\nthan that of mineral oil.\nElectrical parameters\nDielectric strength or AC break down voltage. The break-\ndown voltage for MESSO was found to be 24 kV, which was\ncomparable to the dielectric strength of mineral oil (30 kV).\nDielectric constant (30) and dielectric loss factor (300). The\ndielectric constant (30) and dielectric loss factors (300) for MESSO\nwere calculated by varying the frequencies from 10 Hz to 1 MHz.\nFig. 10 shows the eﬀect of frequency on the dielectric constant3\n0\nfor MESSO at a temperature of 30/C14 C.\nMESSO had higher dielectric constant values than the\nconventional mineral oil (MO). This could be attributed to the\nfact that MESSO is an ester that possesses many polar groups\nsuch as C]O and C–O– that cause orientation polarization in\naddition to atomic and electronic polarizations.

The results are presented in\nFig. 11. The 300 for the insulating materials was ascribed to\nfactors pertaining to the conduction process and polarization\nphenomena. As the esters are endowed with polar groups, it is\nexpected that the conductance increases with the increase in\nfrequency. Polarization phenomenon also causes an increase in\n3\n00 values with the rise in frequency. From the plot of300 vs. log f\ntaken at 30/C14 C (Fig. 11), it is seen that300 for MESSO as well as\nMO exhibited frequency dependence.43\nIn the case of MESSO, the300 value is decreased from 10 Hz to\n6000 Hz and it may be mainly due to the increase in polarization\neﬀect that results in the increase in dielectric constant. Aer\nthis 300 value, there is an increase up to 17 212 Hz and then, it\nalmost remains constant up to 133045 Hz andnally the value\nincrease with the rise in frequency. In the case of mineral oil,\nthe 3\n00 values decrease with an increase in the frequency from\n10 Hz to 77.62 Hz and then increase up to 575 Hz. The values\nfall, rise and become constant in the frequency range from\n12 022 Hz to 488 652 Hz. At higher frequencies, the conductivity\nof MESSO increases due to the presence of polar groups,\nresulting in an increase in the dielectric loss factor.\nTan delta/dielectric dissipation factor.Dissipation factor ¼\ntan d ¼ 3''/3\n0. This is the index term for assessing the quality of\nthe oil. The dielectric dissipation factor for MESSO is much\nhigher than that of mineral oil, as given in Table 5. The\nobserved value was 1.830, which was more than the Interna-\ntional Standard permitted value of >1.580. The stability of the\nmethyl ester, MESSO compared to its raw oil may be ascribed to\nits chemical composition and inter/intramolecular interactions.\nThe parent oil being a glycerol ester has more polar groups,\nwhile MESSO being a methyl ester has relatively fewer polar\ngroups. This enabled the latter to be less reactive and more\nstable than the raw oil.\nSpecic resistivity.The specic resistivity for MESSO was 514\nMU, which was much higher than that of the conventional\nmineral oil (>50 M U, Table 5). This con rms one of the\nimportant features of transformer oils. The higher speci c\nresistivity for MESSO reects the high breakdown strength and\nlow dielectric losses.\nConclusions\nIn the present investigation, methyl ester was synthesized from\nthe oil of Sesbania grandiora (AVISA in Telugu) seeds by the\ntrans-esterication method and the conditions were optimized\nfor obtaining maximum % yield. It is found that with an\noptimum reaction time of 24 h, a catalyst concentration of\n4.5 wt% and a methanol to oil volume ratio of 6 : 1, the yield was\nTable 5 Measured chemical and electrical properties of the ester (MESSO)\nMoisture content\nat 40/C14 C (ppm) Acid value\nAC breakdown voltage\n(kV) Tan delta\nSpecic resistance\n(MU)\nIS limit & value IS13567, <50 IS 1448 [P:2], 0.03 mg of KOH per g IS 6792, >30 IS 6262, >1.58 /C14 —\nEster (MESSO) 35 0.001 mg of KOH per g 24 1.83 /C14 514\nFig. 10 log f vs.dielectric constant.\nFig. 11 log f vs.log(dielectric loss factor).\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 RSC Adv.,2 0 1 9 ,9,3 3 1 1–3319 | 3317\nPaper RSC Advances\nOpen Access Article.

The methyl ester of the Sesbania seeds oil (MESSO)\nwas characterizedvia TG-DTA and FTIR spectroscopy.\nThe physical, chemical and electrical properties were\nmeasured as per International Standards for assessing its suit-\nability as an insulating liquid in transformers. The physical/\nchemical properties such as viscosity, density, interfacial\ntension, moisture content, and the acid/neutralization value\nwere within the International Standard permissible limit of\ninsulating oils. The saturated fatty acid content in MESSO\nretarded the deterioration of the insulating uid in high-\ntemperature environments or long-term storage conditions.\nElectrical parameters such as tan delta and specic resistivity\nwere much higher than those of the mineral oil. The dielectric\nconstant and dielectric loss were found to vary with frequencies\nboth for MESSO and MO. The dielectric constant values were\nhigher for MESSO than MO, which was attributed to the polar\ngroups present in the ester. The higher values imparted more\ncooling ability and high insulation capacity for the ester\ncompared to MO. These results show the suitability of MESSO\nas a liquid dielectric. MESSO derived from natural plants oﬀers\nan interesting alternative to mineral oils for insulation and\ncooling in a transformer due to its bio-degradability, eco-\nfriendly nature, extraction from renewable sources and low-\ncost.\nConﬂicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare.\nReferences\n1 L.
