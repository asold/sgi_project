INTRODUCTION \nThe increasing spread installation of DERs challenges the \nhosting capacity of distribution network and  microgrids. In \nGermany for example, the share of electricity produced from \nDERs was about 30% in the first half of 2014. The government \nis working towards an ambitious plan that aims to achieve 80% \nrenewable generation (most of them are DERs) by 2050 [1]. In \naddition, large amount of electric vehicles (EVs) along with the \nVehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology will be a promising \nalternative combined into the microgrids in the very near future \n[2]. These distributed devices are likely to impose severe \nproblems on the existing microgrids in terms of voltage surge, \nline congestion, harmonic issue, and decreased stability margin \n[3-5]. These problems have been reco gnized by researchers in \nliterature, but unfortunately most of the proposed approaches \nare only effective in some specific scenarios . More \nimportantly, these distributed devices  will impose a heavier  \nburden on both the Microgrid Central Controller (MGCC) and \nthe Distribution Network O perator (DNO) . It is becoming \nmore and more difficult to handle the overall microgrid as a \nwhole controllable entity. \nOn the other hand, the next -generation microgrid is \nexpected to deal with various kinds of DERs as well as EVs \nand c ontrollable loads which usually are characterized with \ndifferent voltage levels, voltage types (DC/AC), frequency, \npower rating, and power quality requirements.  In this sense,  a \nmicrogrid should contain various standard “plug -and-play” \ninterfaces to ensure  various distributed devices can be easi ly \ncoupled into the network and achieve efficient power exchange \namong different types of subordinate grids  [6]. Within the \ncontext of smart grid, microgrids are conjectured to be capable \nof full visibility and contr ollability of all the distributed \ndevices. In this way, the microgrid is likely to optimize the \npower flow and regulate the node voltage profile in real time. \nFurther, the microgrid can timely locate the fault and precisely \ntrip the fault area, achieving brilliant reliability. \nIn this respect, the Smart T ransformer (ST) concept is \npresented as one of the most promising alternatives that can \nexploit the full potential of existing microgrid and enhance the \nhosting capacity of DER and EV. The simplified configuration \nof a ST-based microgrid is shown in Fig. 1, where the ST is \ncoupling with a variety of DERs, EVs, energy storage system \n(ESS), and different types of loads. It is important to stress that \na ST is able to provide various types of electric interfaces  for \ndifferent distributed devices (for example, distributed  devices \nrequire different voltage types, levels, frequencies and grid \ncodes) [7]. Moreover, since the Medium Voltage (MV) side \nand the Low Voltage (LV) side are fully decoupled, the ST can \nprovide superior voltage profile at the Point of Common \nCoupling (PCC) and  therefore largely reduce the chance of \nunplanned islanding operation. In this paper, an AC microgrid \nis considered and different distributed devices are connected to \nthe LVAC bus of the ST. \nSubstation\nPCC\nWind \nturbine PV EV Micro \nturbine\nESS DC \nload\nAC \nload\nDERs\nLocal \nloads\nPower\nInfo\nST\n \nFig. 1. ST-based microgrid concept \nAlthough the ST -based microgrid shows great advantages \nin various aspects, it presents some challenges as well. One \nmajor concern is the resonance problem which is incurred by \nmultiple paral leled power converters  in the syst em. Previous \nresearch on microgrid resonances mainly focused on paralleled \ngrid-connected inverters with LCL filter and damping methods. \nIn [ 8], a passive circuit model was developed and trying to \ninvestigate the resonances and interactions among a large \nnumber of distributed power inverters. A more detailed model \nand transfer function matrix of N-paralleled PV inverters were \npresented in [ 9] which also analyzed resonance  problem of \nparalleled inverters. The authors found that the equivalent grid \nimpedance is increasing when more PV inverters are connected \nto the grid. On this basis, [ 10] further revealed the frequency-\nvarying feature of resonances which are caused by inverter s \ninteraction and grid distortions. Recently, [11] also discussed \nthe interactions of paralleled inverters and classified it as \nharmonic stability issue and employed impedance -based \napproach to model and analyze this issue . However, the ST-\nbased microgrid is quite different from the previous scenarios \nin literature. From Fig. 1 , the PCC voltage of AC network is \nprovided by a DC/AC inverter with passive filters  [12], thus \nthe PCC voltage cannot be assumed as an ideal voltage source \nas that in the former analysis. New features and the interactions \nbetween the ST and DERs must be considered. \nThis paper aims at stud ying the resonance  and interaction \nproblem in a ST-based microgrid. An equivalent system model \nconsidering new features of ST is developed. The resonance \nand interaction as well as stability issues can be investigated by \nusing two equivalent circuit s which are deri ved from the \nequivalent model. To address these issues, active damping \nmethod can be used to alleviate the adverse effects and \nimprove stability margin. Moreover, control designs are \nproposed for both the ST and DER inverters to guarantee a stiff \nvoltage profile of PCC and high power quality DER currents. \nSimulations and e xperimental results from a laboratory \nprototype verify the effectiveness of our investigation and \nproposed control strategies. \nII. MODELING OF ST-BASED MICROGRID \nIn a ST-based microgrid, the voltage profile of each node \nand power flow within the network can be regulated by \nmodifying the injection of active and reactive power of each \nDER  which  is connected to the PCC. Various o ptimal \nalgorithms have been proposed  to provide explicit set -points \nfor each distributed device in different microgrid scenarios. For \ninstance, a centralized control scheme with voltage control and \nline congestion management functionalities has been proposed \nin [13] and  adopted in a ST-based distribution network [14 ], \nproviding improved ancillary services an d performance. With \nthis configuration , the ST LV side can be regarded as a \nvoltage -controlled DC/AC inverter with an LC  filter \nguaranteeing a stiff voltage profile  at the PCC, while the \nconnected DERs can be simplified as a set of paralleled \ncurrent-controlled inverters with LCL filters interconnected \nthrough feeders. The simplified configuration of the ST-based \nmicrogrid is shown in Fig. 2 (a). Since the main objective of \nthis paper is to study the resonance and interaction problems \nbetween the ST and DERs, the front stages and intermediate \nenergy conversion converters are ignored and replaced by the \nDC sources. Moreover, in this paper all the DER inverters as  \nLf1\nCf1\nLff2\nCf2\nLoad\nLgf2\nvs\nio2\nST LV inverter with LC filter\nDER inverter with LCL filter\n.....\nLffn\nCfn\nLgfnion\n \n(a) \n \nST LV inverter with LC fitler\nLf 1\nLff 2 Lgf 2\nCf 1\nCf 2\nvo1\nvo2\nDER inverters with LCL filters\nvs\nio2\nZload\nZline\nLff n Lgf n\nCf nvon\nion...  \n(b) \nFig. 2. Simplified model of a ST -based microgrid: (a) hardware \nconfiguration and (b) eqivalent system model \nwell as their LCL filters are assumed with same sort and thus \nthe inverter parameters and filter values are identical (e.g. Lff2= \nLff3== Lffn= Lff, Lgf2= Lgf3== Lgfn= Lgf, and Cf2= Cf3== Cfn= \nCf). To well describe the resonance problem and interaction \neffects between ST and DERs, an equivalent system model is \ndeveloped based on Fig. 2(a) and shown in Fig. 2(b), where \nZline is the line impedance between ST and PCC, and Zload is the \nequivalent load impedance. From the equivalent model, it is \neasy to see that both the ST LV side voltage vs and the DER \noutput currents iok (2  k  n) are excited by multiple inverter \nsources vok (1  k  n). Here, the DERs are numbering fr om 2 to \nn, thus the value of n 1 represents the number of DERs being \nconnected to the PCC. \nBased on the equivalent model, the dynamics of the \nsimplified ST -based microgrid can be described as Eq. (1), \nwhere von is the input vector which represents the voltage \noutputs of the inverters vok; and G(s) is the matrix of the \ntransfer functions, from the inverter sources (vok) to the control \nvariables (vs or iok). Since the parameters of all the DERs are  \nequal, all the transfer functions from vo1 to iok are identical, and \nall the transfer funct ions from vok (k  1) to vs are identical as \nwell. Hence, the non-diagonal elements of the first row and the \nfirst column of the matrix can be rewritten as that in Eq. (2). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\non\no\no\nnnnn\nn\nn\non\no\ns\nv\nv\nv\nGGG\nGGG\nGGG\ni\ni\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n21\n22221\n11211\n2\nonvG(s)\n         (1) \n13121\n11312\nn\nn\nGGG\nGGG\n\n\n\n\n                              (2) \nA submatrix Gi(s) can be obtained by deleting the first row \nand the first column and it turns out to be a symmetric matrix, \ni.e. Gi = GiT, in which all the diagonal elements and all the \nnon-diagonal elements are identical, respectively.

The elements G11 \nand G21 can be calculated if all the DER inverter sources are \nsupposed to be zero as shown in Fig. 3(a). Likewise, the \nelements G12, G22, and G23 can be calculated by supp osing all \nthe inverter sources to be zero except one of the DER inverter \nsource vok, and the corresponding equivalent circuit is shown in \nFig. 3(b). In these circuits, the same sort DER output filters are \nparalleled together, and thus Zgfeq = sLgf /(n1), Zffeq = sLff \n/(n1), Zcfeq = 1/( sLgf (n1)), Zgfeq = sLgf /(n2), Zffeq = sLff \n/(n2), and Zcfeq= 1/(sLgf (n2)). \nA. Transfer Functions of ST LV Side’s Inverter \nThe diagonal element G11 can be considered as the transfer \nfunction from the ST inverter output voltage vo1 to the ST LV \nside voltage vs, while the non -diagonal element  G12 is the \ntransfer function from one of the DER inverters output voltages \nvok to vs. Specifically, G11 might be the transfer function of the  \nsLf 1\nZloadvo1\nvs\nZline\nsCf 1\n1 io\nZgfeq\nZffeqZcfeq\n \n(a) \nZload\nvs\nZline\nsLff k sLgf k\nvok\nsLf 1\nsCf 1\n1\nsCf k\n1\nio\nio\nZgfeq\n\nZffeq\nZcfeq\n\n \n(b) \nFig. 3.

As we can see, the \nconnection of DERs introduces one additional pole and zero to \nthe system and therefore arouses an additional resonance peak \nat its resonance frequency. To better investigate the  resonance \nproblem, the resonance peak aroused by the device itself is \ndefined as internal resonance, while the resonance peak(s) \naroused by the other devices are defined as external \nresonance(s). With the increasing of the DERs, both the \nexternal and internal resonance peaks shift towards the medium \nfrequency range. \n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\nMagnitude (dB)\n \n101 102 103 104\n-180\n-135\n-90\n-45\n0\nPhase (deg)\nFrequency  (Hz)\nn = 2\nn = 20\nn = 400\n \n(a) \n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\nMagnitude (dB)\n101 102 103 104\n-180\n-135\n-90\n-45\n0\nPhase (deg)\nFrequency  (Hz)\nZline = 0\nZline = 0.1+j0.3\nZline = 0.2+j0.6\n \n(b) \n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\nMagnitude (dB)\n101 102 103 104\n-360\n-270\n-180\n-90\n0\nPhase (deg)\nFrequency  (Hz)\nn = 2\nn = 20\nn = 400\n \n(c) \nFig. 4. Bode diagrams of ST -related transfer functions: (a) diagonal element \nG11 with different n, (b) G11 with different line impedances, and (c) non -\ndiagonal elements G12 \nMeanwhile, the impact of line impedance on the ST is also \ninvestigated and the Bode diagrams of G11 with different line \nimpedances are shown in Fig. 4(b). It can be seen that the \nresonance peak introduced by the DERs can be well dampened \nwith higher impedance value.  This means the DERs would \nhave insignificant effects on the ST LV side if they are \ninstalled far away from the ST. \nOn the other hand, the Bode diagrams of G12 with different \nn are shown in Fig. 5(c). When the DER number is relatively \nlow, both the couplin g effect and resonance issue are severe. \nHowever, with the increasing of DERs, the resonance peak of \nDERs can be largely attenuated and the amplitude of G12 could \nbe maintained at the allowable low level. For example, when \n399 DERs are connected to the PCC , the amplitude of G12 is \nless than 10dB within the whole frequency range except the \nresonance point of ST itself, which means the DER sources \nimpose very limited coupling effects on the ST LV side \nvoltage. \nB. Transfer Functions of DER Inverters \nFor the DER output current iok, there are three types of \nelements in G(s), which are G21, G22, and G23. The first non -\ndiagonal element G21 can be considered as the transfer function \nfrom the ST inverter output voltage vo1 to the DER output \ncurrent iok.

It is obviously to see that the ST LV side inverter will \nintroduce an additional resonance peak into the overall system. \nWith the increasing of the DERs, this resonance peak would be \nattenuated and shift towards the higher frequen cy range. The \nBode diagrams of G22 and G23 with different n are shown in \nFig. 5(b) and (c). In both diagrams, the external resonances and \nthe coupling interactions will be further mitigated by \nincreasing the number of DERs in the microgrid, while the \ninternal resonance s are  always the same under different \nconditions so that necessary damping method is needed. \nIII. CONTROL AND RESONANCE DAMPING \nA. Active Damping Analysis \nThe active damping methods includ ing filter-based active \ndamping and mult iloop-based active damping have been \napplied to standalone and grid -connected inverter applications \n[15-16]. It shows effectiveness to resonance and is less \nsensitive to the parameter variations . In this paper, the \nmultiloop-based active damping method is employed, which is \nto mimic the idea of passive damping through an inner \nfeedback control loop. For inverters with LC or LCL filters, the \ninductor current and capacitor current inner-loop feedbacks are \ncommonly used to maintain stability and alleviate adverse \nfeatures caused by resonances.  \nTo well analyze the open-loop features, the PWM blo ck \nand the computation as well as the ADC block are  considered \nas the 1.5Ts delay due to elaboration of the computation device \n(Ts) and to the PWM (0.5Ts), it can be expended by using Padé \nApproximant as following: \n22\n22\n5.1\n25.2912\n25.2912)( sTsT\nsTsTesG\nss\nsssT\nd\ns\n\n \n                (10) \n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\nMagnitude (dB)\n101 102 103 104\n-90\n-45\n0\n45\n90\n135\nPhase (deg)\nFrequency  (Hz)\nn = 2\nn = 20\nn = 400\n \n(a) \n-100\n0\n100\nMagnitude (dB)\n101 102 103 104\n-450\n-360\n-270\n-180\n-90\n0\nPhase (deg)\nFrequency  (Hz)\nn = 3\nn = 20\nn = 400\n \n(b) \n-400\n-200\n0\n200\nMagnitude (dB)\n101 102 103 104\n-450\n-360\n-270\n-180\n-90\n0\n90\n180\nPhase (deg)\nFrequency  (Hz)\nn = 3\nn = 20\nn = 400\n \n(c) \nFig. 5. Bode diagrams of DER-related transfer functions with different n: (a) \nnon-diagonal element G21, (b) diagonal element G22, and (c) non -diagonal \nelements G23 \nThe detailed filter parameters of ST and DERs are shown in \nTable I. Fig. 6 compares the open-loop Bode diagrams for ST \ninverter with different inner -loop feedbacks. It is observed the \nexternal resonance peak  caused by the DERs  can be better \ndamped by using capacitor current feedback  when same inner \ngains are used, wh ereas the phase m argins of both two \nfeedbacks are still the same. With these considerations, the \ncapacitor current feedback is utilized in the DER inverter with \nbetter damping effects, while the inductor current feedback is \nemployed in the ST inverter to alleviate resonance as well as to \nlimit the output power rating. \nBy using the inner -loops, the open -loop Bode diagram of \nG11 with active damping is shown in Fig. 7(a) as the red line. In \nthis study case, four DERs are connected to the PCC of \nmicrogrid and the inner -loop gains of both  the ST and DERs \nare selected as 5. For comparison, the Bode diagrams of  G11 \nwithout damping are also shown in Fig. 7(a) as the blue and \ngreen lines. Obviously, with effective damping, both the \ninternal and external resonance peaks are fully elim inated. \nThere is neither positive nor negative 180º crossing at the \ncritical frequency, which indicates the stability condition is \nwell fulfilled in this system. \n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\nMagnitude (dB)\n10\n1\n10\n2\n10\n3\n10\n4\n-450\n-360\n-270\n-180\n-90\n0\nPhase (deg)\nFrequency  (Hz)\nInductor current feedback\nCapacitor current feedback\n \nFig. 6.

Comparisons of open-loop Bode diagrams of diagonal elelments with/ \nwithout damping: (a) G11 and (b) G22 \nThe open -loop Bode diagram s of G22 are shown in Fig. \n7(b). Compared with the Bode diagram without damping (red \nline), both the internal and external resonance peaks are \ncompletely attenuated by the active damping method as the \nblue line. The 180º crossings at the critical frequencies are \ncancelled within the whole range. More importantly, the \namplitudes of the system are not reduced except the resonance \npoints, guaranteeing the control performance of DERs. \nTABLE I.

Design of the Outer-Loop Control \nFrom the Bode diagrams shown in Fig. 4, we see that the \nexternal resonance of ST can be largely attenuated with the \nincreasing of the DERs and line impedance , while those of \nDERs are not . On the other hand, since the capacitor value of \nST is much larger than that of the DER. The ST intro duces \nlower frequency external resonance to the DERs as it shown in \nFig. 5. In this regard, the DERs are more sensitive to the \nexternal resonances as well as low-order harmonics.  \nWith these considerations, the outer-loop control of ST and \nDER inverters ut ilize repetitive control (RC) and PR control, \nrespectively. Fig. 8 shows the detailed control diagrams of the \ncontrol systems of the ST and DER inverters. Both the RC and \nPR controllers can provide superior steady -state performance \nfor sinusoidal signals. In addition, the RC can well eliminate \nthe low-order harmonics and guarantee the ST LV side voltage \nwith good power quality. In this way, the low -order harmonic \npropagation can be avoided within the microgrid and enhance \nits harmonic stability. \n\nvref vo1 vs\nGd(s)kc1  1\nsCf1sLf1\n1\nio\niL  icP+RC\n \n(a) \niref\n+- +-+-+- vo2\nvc iL igic\n+-\nvs\nPR kc2 Gd(s) sLff2\n1\nsCf2\n1\nsLgf2\n1\n \n(b) \nFig. 8.

Stability Analysis \nFig. 9(a) shows the stability (phase) margins and Nyquist \nplots of ST LV side inverter system with different inner -loop \ngains, where kc1 and kc2 are the inner -loop gains of ST and \nDER inverters, respectively. With the introduction of the inner-\nloop gains, the phase margins will gradually change from \nunstable region to stable region. In the stable region, the phase \nmargins increase with the increasing of gains, meaning that the \nsystem becomes more stable. The Nyquist plots shown in Fig. \n9(b) further confirm  the conclusions. With proper damping \ngains, the system becomes stable because there is no \nencirclement of the point at (1, j0). Similar conclusions can be \ndrawn in the DER inverter case with these stability analyses.  \nHowever, when inner -loop gains become high, there are \nconsiderable phase lags in low -frequency range which are bad \nfor the waveform controls. So a trade -off of inner-loop gains \nshould be made between the stability and the phase lags. \nIV. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nA. Simulation Results \nTo validate the righteousness of the analysis as well as the \neffectiveness of the proposed control strategies, a ST -based \nmicrogrid was simulated by using the MATLAB/Simulink \nenvironment and the aid of the PLECS toolbox.  In our study \ncases, four  DER system s are  connected to the PCC , whose \nvoltage is supplied by a ST through the power line . The filter \nparameters of ST LV side inverter and DER inverters are same \nas those in Table I, the line impedance between ST LV side \nand PCC is 0.1+ j0.15 Ω, and the detailed control parameters \nare listed in Table II. \nFig. 10 illustrates the simulated voltage profiles of the ST \nand output current of each DER when active damping method \nis not employed. Although the control parameters of each DER \nare properly designed, the results indicate that the integrated \nsystem is unstable. Amplified low -order harmonics propagate \nwithin the microgrid and leads to severe oscillations and \ndistortions in the DER current. However, the voltage profile of \nST is acceptable with relatively low THD (=3.15%), it proves \nthe ST is less insensitive to the resonance as well as harmonics \nin such system. Fig. 11 shows the simul ated waveforms when \nactive damping method is used. It can be observed that both the \nST LV side voltage and the DER current are much better than \nthose of Fig. 10. \n2\n4\n6\n8\n2\n4\n6\n8\n0\n20\n40\n60\nkc1\nkc2\nPhase margin\n \n(a) \n-6 -4 -2 0 2\n-5\n0\n5\nReal Axis\nImaginary Axis (1, j0)\nkc1=kc2=0\nkc1=kc2=1\nkc1=kc2=5\n \n(b) \nFig. 9.

Simulated performance of ST -based microgrid without active \ndamping (x: time (s)): (a) ST voltage (y: voltage (V)) and (b) DER current (y: \ncurrent (A)) \nThe dynamic performance of the ST -based microgrid with \nthe active damping method is also verified in the simulation. \nIn this case, three DERs are connected to the PCC at first, and \nthe 4th DER is plugged into the microgrid at t=0.2s. Fig. 12 \nshows the LV side voltage profile and current of the ST. It can \nbe seen that the ST voltage is quite stiff during the connection \nof DER, while the ST current can recover to its steady -state in \nless than one cycle. More over, because of the communication \nwithin the microgrid, the ST can instantly assign set -points to \nall the DERs. As a result, the RMS value of ST current before \nand after the transient point ( t=0.2s) are almost the same. The \nDER currents at the transient s tate are shown in Fig. 13. All \nDERs present good dynamics during both the transient and the \nstart-up. \n \n                                  (a)                                                     (b) \nFig. 11.

Experimental Results \nTo verify the effectiveness of this ST-based microgrid in a \nlaboratory scale prototype, the laboratory setup with the same \nconfiguration and parameters of simulation is built, and its \nphotograph is given in Fig. 1 4. The ST inverter uses a \nSemikron AN8005 IGBT inverter and is controlled by a \ndSPACE1104 control card.

Experimental setup \nFig. 15(a) shows the measured voltage of ST LV side \ninverter, and the corresponding THD value is 0.663%, which \nindicates the steady -state performance of ST inverter is quite \ngood. With the voltage support of ST, the output current of the \nDER inverter is shown in Fig. 15(b) with the THD value being \n2.239%.

CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper presents a novel microgrid operated with a ST \nand discusses the resonance problem as well as stability issue \nof the  system. A simplified system model and its two \nequivalent circuits have been presented to identify the potential \nresonances and analyze the interactions. To solve the problems, \nmultiloop-based active damping methods have been adopted in \nboth the ST and the DER inverters and the damping effects are \nwell studied. The outer -loop control design for ST and DER \ninverters are also given in this paper.
