Specifically, patients with cancer diagnoses require\nfrequent and deep contact with the health care system. This is\na particular challenge for rural cancer patients, who must travel\non average 48 miles to see their nearest health care provider in\nperson [1,2]. The impact of distance from providers is felt\nthroughout the cancer care continuum, from detection and\ndiagnosis to treatment and follow-up care. For example, rural\ncancer patients have a significantly lower chance of receiving\nappropriate chemotherapy than their urban counterparts, due in\npart to distance and travel time [1,2]. Although many\ntelemedicine centers were established to increase geographic\naccess for rural patients, many are still too far for certain\ngeographic populations [2,3].\nThe lack of access due to travel distance results in rural cancer\npatients participating less frequently in regular cancer screening\nthan urban cancer patients, including screenings for more\nprevalent malignancies, such as breast, colon, and prostate\ncancer [1]. Due to the lower rates of patients in rural regions\ngetting cancer screenings, they are more likely to be diagnosed\nwith cancer at a later stage than patients who live in an urban\nregion [1]. This may, in part, help to explain why cancer patients\nin rural regions have a higher mortality rate than cancer patients\nin urban regions [4]. Efforts have been made in recent years to\nuse technology to creatively reach specific groups of patients\nin rural areas, such as telemedicine programs aimed at reaching\nrural Native American communities, or for certain specialties,\nincluding ambulatory, inpatient, and perinatal care [5-7].\nAccompanying the rise of telemedicine has been increasing\ninternet adoption nationwide, with studies reporting that access\nto the internet increased for all sociodemographic groups\nbetween 2003 and 2014 [8]. This is due in part to advances in\ntechnology, which allow individuals to access the internet more\nfreely and on-demand using handheld and portable devices [9].\nIn parallel with these hardware and internet connectivity\nadvances has been increasing adoption of electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) and electronic personal health information\n(ePHI) tools by health care providers; this has the potential to\nfacilitate increased patient engagement and communication with\nhealth care providers [10]. Despite efforts to increase access to\nthe internet and facilitate opportunities for remote interaction\nwith the health care system, populations still lack internet access\nand connection quality, which affects their ability to access and\nuse ePHI tools; this, in turn, may be further exacerbating the\nexisting health information technology–related digital divide\namong rural and urban patients.\nIn this study, we sought to (1) determine the overall use of ePHI\ntools among cancer patients in urban and rural regions and (2)\nassess the rate of email communication between cancer patients\nin urban and rural regions and their health care provider. We\nhypothesized that urban cancer patients access their ePHI more\nfrequently than rural cancer patients and urban cancer patients\ncommunicate via email with their health care provider more\nfrequently than cancer patients in rural regions. To study the\nrural-urban disparity longitudinally and determine whether it\nwas growing, we used multiple administrations of the National\nCancer Institute’s Health Information National Trends Survey\n(HINTS) data.\nMethods\nSurvey Population and Data Collection\nHINTS is a nationally representative survey of\nnoninstitutionalized adults over the age of 18 years in the United\nStates. The survey includes a variety of health-related topics,\nsuch as the use of health technology and communication with\nhealth care providers. The mode of survey delivery varied across\nHINTS fieldings and included random digital dialing (RDD)\nand regular mail distribution. Data from years 2003, 2005, 2008,\n2011, 2013, and 2017 were included in the survey. Surveys\nwere distributed though RDD in 2003, 2005, and 2008. Physical\nmail distribution occurred in years 2008 (in parallel with RDD),\n2011, 2013, and 2017. The response rate of random digital\ndialing was 33.1% in 2003, 20.8% in 2005, and 24.2% in 2008;\nwhile the response rate for regular mail administration was\n40.0% in 2008, 36.7% in 2011, 35.2% in 2013, and 32.4% in\n2017. Further information on data collection, weighted\nmethodologies, and sample frames are available through HINTS\nmethodology reports [11].\nDependent Variables\nOur primary objective was to examine the relationship between\nrural and urban residence and self-management of ePHI online\namong cancer patients. The original survey item of interest\n(survey years 2003, 2005, 2008, 2011, and 2013) is as follows:\n• “In the last 12 months, have you used the internet to keep\ntrack of protected health information, such as care received,\ntest results, or upcoming medical appointments?”\nIn 2017, more granular items were asked of respondents, and\nthe survey item was changed:\n• “In the past 12 months, have you used a computer,\nsmartphone, or other electronic means to do any of the\nfollowing?\n• Make appointments with a health care provider\n• Track health care charges and costs\n• Fill out forms or paperwork related to your health care\n• Look up test results”\nAny respondent who answered yes to any of these subitems\nwere categorized has having managed their ePHI online;\nconversely, respondents who answered no to all 4 subitems\nwere considered to have not managed their ePHI. Before 2017,\nthe question was asked of individuals who previously stated\nthey had regular internet access. In 2017, the question was asked\nof those who stated they had both regular internet access and\naccess to their electronic health records.\nOur secondary objective was to determine whether a difference\nexisted between rural and urban cancer patients in terms of\ncommunicating online with their health care provider. The item\nused in the earlier HINTS deliveries (2003-2013) is as follows:\n• “In the last 12 months, have you used email or the internet\nto communicate with a doctor or doctor’s office?”\nJMIR Cancer 2020 | vol. 6 | iss. 2 | e17352 | p. 2http://cancer.jmir.org/2020/2/e17352/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGreenberg-Worisek et alJMIR CANCER\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nIn 2017, the wording has changed slightly:\n• “In the past 12 months, have you used a computer,\nsmartphone, or other electronic means to do any of the\nfollowing?\n• Use email or the internet to communicate with a doctor\nor a doctor’s office.”\nBefore 2017, the item was only asked of those who stated they\nhad access to the internet. In 2017, the question was asked of\nall participants, regardless of access to the internet or their\nEHRs.\nIndependent Variables\nAnalyses were restricted to respondents who replied yes in\nresponse to the survey item “Have you ever been diagnosed as\nhaving cancer?” Additional independent variables included in\nanalyses were age, race/ethnicity, income, gender, and\neducational level; all were categorical. Age was divided into\nage groups of 18-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65-74, and 75+.\nRace/ethnicity was condensed into Hispanic, non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic other [12]. Income\nwas organized into 5 categories: <$20,000, $20,000 to <$35,000,\n$35,000 to <$50,000, $50,000 to <$75,000, and >$75,000. Sex\nwas categorized as a binary variable (male or female).\nEducational level was categorized as less than high school, high\nschool, some college, and college graduate or higher.\nEach participant was categorized as being in an urban or rural\npopulation following the Rural-Urban Continuum Code (RUCC)\nthrough the United States Department of Agriculture [13]. The\ncode categorizes respondents based on their location (population\nsize, metro county, or nonmetro county). The codes are on a\nscale of 1 to 9; if a region falls under codes 1 to 3, the\nclassification is a metro county with a population of at least\n250,000—in other words, an urban category. If a region falls\nunder codes 4 to 9, the classification is a nonmetro county with\na population ranging from 2500 to 20,000\nindividuals—therefore, a rural county.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe use of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) allowed for weighted\nanalysis to incorporate jackknife replicate weights to obtain\npopulation-level estimates. Briefly, a set of 50 jackknife weights\nare developed for each survey administration using data from\nthe most recent US Census; this allows the weights to be used\nin conjunction with survey procedures within SAS to generate\npopulation-level estimates based on the survey sample data.\nBivariate analyses were conducted to determine whether\nassociations existed between geographic location and each of\nthe independent and dependent variables; this served as an\nunadjusted analysis. The independent variables previously\nmentioned (age, race/ethnicity, income, gender, and educational\nlevel) were adjusted for using multivariable logistic regression\nfor each dependent variable of interest. Predicted marginals\nwere also calculated to observe any statistical differences over\na period of time by adding interaction terms between each\nindependent variable and survey year to the multivariate model\none at a time. A complete case analysis was used for both\noutcomes of interest.\nResults\nStudy Population Characteristics\nAll percentages reported are weighted to generate\npopulation-level estimates using the HINTS jackknife weighting\nparadigm. A total of 4163 respondents included across HINTS\nsurvey administrations reported having been diagnosed with\ncancer; this included skin cancers. These individuals had higher\nincomes (883/3498, or 27.6%, reported annual incomes of\n$75,000 or higher); were aged 50 years and older (3500/4107,\n80.6%); female (2618/4121, 59.2%); and non-Hispanic white\n(3223/3888, 82.4%). Bivariate analyses showed a statistically\nsignificant relationship between sociodemographic\ncharacteristics (race/ethnicity, education level, income, and\nemail/documentation) and urban/rural residency status (Table\n1).\nJMIR Cancer 2020 | vol. 6 | iss. 2 | e17352 | p. 3http://cancer.jmir.org/2020/2/e17352/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGreenberg-Worisek et alJMIR CANCER\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nTable 1.

Additionally, we sought to examine\nwhether a relationship exists between email communication\nwith health care providers and rural/urban residence among\ncancer patients. No association was found between ePHI use\nand geography among cancer patients; this lack of association\nJMIR Cancer 2020 | vol. 6 | iss. 2 | e17352 | p. 7http://cancer.jmir.org/2020/2/e17352/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGreenberg-Worisek et alJMIR CANCER\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\npersisted after adjustment for relevant sociodemographic\ncovariates. However, results did show that rural cancer patients\nwere significantly less likely to email health care providers\ncompared with their urban counterparts.\nPrior work has shown no difference in the use of ePHI tools\nbetween urban and rural residents in the general population\n[14]. Our adjusted results lead us to conclude that there is no\ndifference in use of ePHI tools between rural and urban cancer\npatients, indicating our original hypothesis that a difference\nexisted was incorrect. Rural cancer patients may access their\nePHI less than urban cancer patients. There may be several\nunderlying reasons for this trend. First, lower rates of ePHI use\nmay be due in part to lack of awareness; for example, health\ncare providers tend to offer rural patients access to ePHI tools\nless frequently, which may play a role further exacerbating the\ndigital divide among rural and urban patients [14]. Second,\ndespite advances in the internet and technology, patients in rural\nregions are at a disadvantage in comparison with patients in\nurban regions. Individuals who live in a rural region are reported\nto have lower use of the internet than individuals who live in\nan urban region [8]. Due to the lack of infrastructure of\ntelecommunication, rural regions typically do not have optimal\ninternet service [15]. This trend persists despite the Federal\nCommunications Commission effort to expand broadband access\n[15]. A lack of internet access may prevent patients in rural\nregions from accessing ePHI tools that could potentially improve\ntheir quality of care, further perpetuating the existing health\ninformation technology divide.\nWhile no association was found between rural and urban\nresidency and ePHI use, a statistically significant association\nwas found between geography and emailing providers. A recent\nstudy using HINTS data found a similar disparity among all\nHINTS participants, with rural participants reporting that they\nemailed their health care providers significantly less than urban\ncounterparts [12]. While some have hypothesized that\nindividuals with chronic conditions, such as cancer, are more\nlikely to email their health care providers, patients with one or\nmore chronic conditions have actually been shown to have\nreduced odds of emailing their providers [16]. The results\npresented here suggest that this disparity may be even more\nexacerbated among rural patients with chronic conditions.\nAdditional studies are needed to further characterize the barriers\nto use of email to communicate with providers; we hypothesize\nthat these may include personal factors (such as lack of\nawareness, unwillingness to adopt ePHI-related technologies,\nand/or concerns about privacy) as well as structural factors (lack\nof access to reliable internet connections, cellular networks,\netc).\nStrengths and Limitations\nA strength of this study is its use of HINTS. This is a nationally\nrepresentative survey of individuals who are 18 years or older\nthat has been administered several times over the course of 15\nyears, allowing for longitudinal study of trends. An additional\nstrength is its use of a jackknife weighting paradigm that allows\nfor the generation of population-level estimates. A limitation\nto this study is that the items analyzed addressing ePHI and\nemail communication were fairly general; this may have limited\nthe ability to identify specific relationships, included the\nexpected ones. Another limitation to this study is smaller sample\nsize in some categories, due to the restriction of the data solely\nto cancer patients, as well as the inability to determine causation\ndue to the cross-sectional nature of each survey. Furthermore,\nHINTS did not ask follow-up questions about the frequency of\nePHI use and communication in older survey administrations,\nnor did the survey include items regarding which provider was\nemailed and what type of online tool was used to carry out these\ntasks.\nConclusions and Future Directions\nWe sought to assess the use of ePHI tools and frequency of\nelectronic communication between adult cancer patients and\ntheir health care providers and to determine whether a difference\nexisted in use between those living in rural and urban areas of\nthe United States. Although our results demonstrate that there\nis no statistically significant difference between the rural/urban\nstatus of cancer patients and their ePHI use, the data lead us to\nbelieve that rural cancer patients access their electronic records\nless frequently than urban cancer patients. Cancer patients in\nurban regions are also more likely to communicate with their\nhealth care providers via email than rural cancer patients.\nAlthough our results demonstrate a relationship present for both\nemail communication and ePHI use, there are many other\ncomponents that affect the role of internet access and use of\nthese tools that we could not explore due to the limitations\npresent. By increasing the awareness, access, and use of these\ntools in rural populations, there is the potential to improve the\npatients’ ability to increase self-efficacy with regard to their\nhealth care and improve clinical outcomes. Future studies should\nfocus on targeted interventions for rural cancer patients and\nexamine whether the implementation of ePHI and electronic\nmessaging tools affects patient outcomes.\nAcknowledgments\nHINTS is funded by the National Cancer Institute’s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences with contract support\nto Westat, Inc.\nConflicts of Interest\nNone declared.\nReferences\nJMIR Cancer 2020 | vol. 6 | iss. 2 | e17352 | p. 8http://cancer.jmir.org/2020/2/e17352/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGreenberg-Worisek et alJMIR CANCER\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\n1.
