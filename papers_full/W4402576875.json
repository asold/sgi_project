  "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of large language model (LLM) in answering pathology questions based on pathology reports (PRs) of colorectal cancer (CRC). Four common questions (CQs) and corresponding answers about pathology were retrieved from public webpages. These questions were input as prompts for Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) (gpt-3.5-turbo). The quality indicators (understanding, scientificity, satisfaction) of all answers were evaluated by gastroenterologists. Standard PRs from 5 CRC patients who received radical surgeries in Shanghai Changzheng Hospital were selected. Six report questions (RQs) and corresponding answers were generated by a gastroenterologist and a pathologist. We developed an interactive PRs interpretation system which allows users to upload standard PRs as JPG images. Then the ChatGPT's responses to the RQs were generated. The quality indicators of all answers were evaluated by gastroenterologists and out-patients. As for CQs, gastroenterologists rated AI answers similarly to non-AI answers in understanding, scientificity, and satisfaction. As for RQ1-3, gastroenterologists and patients rated the AI mean scores higher than non-AI scores among the quality indicators. However, as for RQ4-6, gastroenterologists rated the AI mean scores lower than non-AI scores in understanding and satisfaction. In RQ4, gastroenterologists rated the AI scores lower than non-AI scores in scientificity ( P = 0.011); patients rated the AI scores lower than non-AI scores in understanding ( P = 0.004) and satisfaction ( P = 0.011). In conclusion, LLM could generate credible answers to common pathology questions and conceptual questions on the PRs. It holds great potential in improving doctor-patient communication.",
