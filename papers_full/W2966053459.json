One of the current questions of AI is the \nchallenges behind the analysis of job video inte r-\nviews. There are pros and cons to using AI in r e-\ncruitment processes, and potential consequences \nfor candidates, companies and states. Furthermore, \nthe deficit of regulation of these systems reinforces \nthe need for external and neutral auditing of the \ntypes of analysis made in interviews. We, ther e-\nfore, propose a Multi-agent system architecture for \nneutral auditing to guarantee an inclusive and acc u-\nrate AI and to reduce the potential discrimination \nin the job market. \n1 Introduction  \nIn\n the early stages of the research, we focused on theoretical \nontology-based information retrieval approaches to later \naddress a current issue of the AI, such as domain-specific AI \nin corporate settings. \n Traditionally, AI proved very valuable for resume and \nkeywords scanning and extraction of candidate skills devoid \nof bias. There has been a recent trend towards video-\ninterview analysis in Human Resources. A survey by Pe r-\nsonnel Today found that 38% of enterprises are using AI in \ntheir workplace with 62% expecting to use it by 2018.\n1 \n Concerning video-interview systems, there are limit a-\ntions, some are attributable to the very nature of the tec h-\nnology (incorrect or biased datasets), and others are related \nto human bias or the specific agenda of the recruiting co m-\npany.  It is common measuring eye time or candidate r e-\nsponse time. However, the state- of-the-art in image analysis \nmay allow pre-selecting for age or sexual orientation or \nother controversial characteristics. Such AI-based analyses \ncould lead to ethical and legal consequences (e.g. in some \ncountries is forbidden to ask for age in recruitment \n                                                 \n1 https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/ten-ways-hr-tech-leaders-\ncan-make-artificial-intelligence/ \n \nprocesses). This is why fostering proper auditing of video \ninterview systems it is particularly important. \n The most relevant innovation of this proposed work will \nbe the attempt to automatise part of this legal and ethical \nauditing as well as some analyses carried out by the diffe r-\nent distributed agents. The specific contribution  and \nprogress made thus so far is mainly the proposal of a Multi-\nagent systems architecture for auditing HR [Fig 1]. Add i-\ntionally, prototyping of some parts -legal rules engine- has \nbeen created. \n The future direction and goal  are either the total or the \npartial implementation of the automatisation in the Multi-\nagent System. Questions could arise when it comes to the \ncomplete implementation and testing of such a complex and \ndistributed in nature system for a PhD thesis. Recently, we \nhave been through the definition of the common lexicon and \nthe full formalisation and implementation of a subset of \nlegal rules. Both combined could help in achieving good \nresults. We face the dilemma of formalising Labour Law \nand narrow it to a set of rules. For the time being, around 50 \ncurrent legal rules have been considered. \n Concerning limits, so far, we are in the implementation \nphase, more concretely defining flows among agents and \nprototyping. The first problem could be the use of different \nontologies. As the doctoral dissertation advances, we will \nsee if we could address in all detail the architecture or just  \n \n  \n \nFigure 1: Multi-Agent System architecture \nAI in Recruiting.

Precisely, it is the absence of affordable and \nlimited testing opportunities of real corporate applications in \nour academic setting which limits the research. The testing \nis very dependent on data availability, and the real attributed \nmeasured by video interview systems, so we are counting on \nprototyping on a simulated corporate scenario. Legal re a-\nsoning entails the correct formalisation of laws in a different \njurisdiction and it could be necessary even the technical \nsupervision of jurists. \n The contribution of this PhD is, therefore, the automatisa-\ntion. The benefits of our research will be a step forward in \nthe automatisation of tasks in HR and ethical and legal an a-\nlyses of video interview techniques. To achieve this goal \nand solve the research problem of automatisation and more \nethical and legal auditing we are going to rely on the int e-\ngration of ontologies into Multi-Agent Systems for Auditing \nin HR. The current approach  is the definition of agents \ntasks and the exploration of both Multi-agent systems and \nontologies and shared lexicons, which foster domain spec i-\nfication and interoperability [Dileo et al., 2006]. \n Multi-agent systems pose similar challenges concerning \ninformation formats that traditional complex distributed \nsystems and the problem is more acute in firms.  \n Domain-specific AI has been recently used as a decision-\nmaking supporting tool. A job is composed of tasks and AI \nin Recruiting has indeed saved tasks for managers. The \ntrend -the aim of AI- is towards full automatisation. \n2 Motivation for the Research Paper \nThere has been a recent trend towards video-interview ana l-\nysis in HR departments. Traditionally, AI played no more \nthan an assistant role in HR, e.g. resume scanning. Howe v-\ner, lately, apps and systems like HireVue 2, Montage 3, \nSparkHire4 and WePow 5 have been changing how recrui t-\nment is carried out. An AI-based video interview system \ncould be programmed to check, during an interview, fe a-\ntures such as age, lighting, tone of voice, cadence, keywords \nused (substantial conversation), mood, behaviour (eccentric, \nmovement or quite calm and not talkative), eye contact and, \nabove all, emotions. AI targets the specific traits of a cus-\ntomer-oriented role that employers want. \n AI has produced benefits for HR so far, including recrui t-\ning time and customised questions and answers. Attention to \ndetail (eye contact time, emotions and body language) and \nlack of interviewer bias (physical appearance, tattoos, etc e-\ntera) are other additional advantages. However, several \nproblems accompany the use of these technologies; for \nexample, candidates are unfamiliar with video interview \nanalysis (for example, lighting, settings), which could affect \nglobal performance. It is necessary to point out the gender \n                                                 \n2 https://www.hirevue.com/ \n3 https://www.montagetalent.com/ \n4 https://www.sparkhire.com/ \n5 https://www.wepow.com/es/ \nand racial bias and the imprecision of technology. Trad i-\ntionally, Machine Learning algorithms were trained with \nbiased datasets. For instance, Affectiva \n6 emotions dataset \nwas fed with data from Superbowl viewers, and could pr e-\nsumably have culture-bias. \n We studied several potential controversial characteri s-\ntics, among them, facial symmetry, race, gender, sexual \norientations in voice and image recordings. The problem of \nracial-bias in AI is not new, just like the detection of mixed \nrace in bad lighting conditions according to Siyao et al \n[Siyao et al.,  2014]. As an illustration of the advances in \nsexual orientation recognition, one study [Kosinski and \nWang, 2018] needed ethical supervision due to the opaque \ninvasive nature of the research and the use of real user data \nfrom dating applications. Researchers argue about the rel a-\ntionship among homosexuality, morphological features such \nas jawline and exposure to hormones in the womb. \n Regarding Ethical and legal aspects of AI, analyses may \nhave its benefits, it also strips away aspects of humanity, \nreducing a human recruit to a set of descriptors. The aut o-\nmation of HR processes could lead to potential ethical and \nlegal implications that cannot be ignored. In some countries, \ncompanies are not allowed to ask a candidate’s age during \nselection. Traditionally, United States legislation has been \nparticularly protective of racial discrimination in the \nworkplace (the Civil Rights Act, 1964, forbids \"improperly \nclassifying or segregating employees by race\"). Moreover, \nyet even these regulations exist to reduce discrimination, \nenterprises are given more and more freedom to customise \ntheir systems. We conclude that it is risky to follow the \nadoption of AI in recruiting blindly. \nAcknowledgments \nWork partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of \nScience, Innovation and Universities, co-funded by EU \nFEDER Funds, through grants TIN2015-65515- C4-4-R and \nRTI2018-095390-B-C33. \nReferences \n [Siyao et al., 2014] Siyao Fu, Haibo He, Zeng-Guang Hou. \nLearning from Face: A Survey.
