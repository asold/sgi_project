Introduction\nWith the proliferation of power electronic semicon-\nductor switches for high power, the notion of sub-\nstituting the traditional line frequency power trans-\nformers (LFT) in MV distribution grids and on-board\ntraction applications with the system consisting of\nmuch smaller and lighter MFTs driven by power\nelectronic converters, namely the solid state trans-\nformer (SST), has been gaining popularity [1]. This\nsolution is especially interesting for on-board trac-\ntion supplies operated at 16.7Hz line frequency as\nthe decrease in transformer weight and volume are\nboth most drastic and the most important design cri-\nteria for these applications. Despite the increased\nworldwide research effort, the SST technology is\nstill on a level of academic and advanced industry\nprototypes [2].\nWhile the LFT is one of the oldest and well es-\ntablished technologies in the ﬁeld of electrical en-\ngineering, high-power high-voltage MFT is not yet\na fully mature or standardized technology. There\nexists plenty of area for improvements in terms of\nmodeling, insulation coordination, electrical param-\neter control, thermal coordination and the overall\ndesign optimization. In the documented research\non modeling and design optimization of the MFT\n[3]–[5], the design considerations tied to the proper\ninsulation coordination are usually neglected and\nthere is no information about any insulation testing\n(e.g. PD and BIL tests). Furthermore, besides the\ndiscussion, selection and application of the avail-\nable analytical sub-system models (e.g. leakage in-\nductance [6], core [7]–[9] and winding losses [10]–\n[20]), from the often quite old literature, there has\nnot been much effort directed into improving the ac-\ncuracy and precision of these estimations.\nDesigning a high-power high-voltage medium fre-\nquency transformer is associated with multiple tech-\nnical challenges related to electrical, magnetic, di-\nelectric and thermal performance limits encoun-\ntered in the system. Various technological choices\nmust be carefully considered and selected before\nbeing included into a generic multi-objective opti-\nmization. Moreover, the quality of the result of the\noptimization is only as good as the utilized models.\nTherefore, all relevant phenomena, within physical\nsubsystems of this complex multi-physical system,\nmust be modeled both accurately and precisely in\nreference to their impact on the given application.\nEspecially, precise control of electric parameters\nis paramount when it comes to the design of the\nMFT for resonant converters where the transformer\nis a part of a resonant circuit. Finally, the prob-\nlems of correct insulation and thermal coordination\nand choice of the technologies involved in the trans-\nformer design itself still remain under discussion.\nThis paper discusses the main considerations and\nprovides a complete design optimization process of\nan MFT, together with full experimental veriﬁcation\non a realized 100kW prototype.\nPCIM Europe 2017, 16 – 18 May 2017, Nuremberg, Germany\nISBN 978-3-8007-4424-4\n© VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach\n423\n2. MFT Design Optimization\nWhile it is tempting to perform the MFT design op-\ntimization utilizing some of the available and formal\nmathematical optimization tools, the highly nonlin-\near and non-convex nature of the problem and a\nmix of continuous and discrete variables makes this\na rather difﬁcult task. Moreover, proper setting of\nthe multi-variable objective function in order to se-\nlect the desired design is neither straight forward\nnor intuitive. Instead, we have chosen to rely on a\nvery primitive yet, in this particular case, very reli-\nable brute-force approach supplemented with cer-\ntain considerations allowing the algorithm to ex-\nclude many of the designs which test infeasible in\nthe preliminary check. This lowers the computa-\ntional weight and increases the capacity of the al-\ngorithm in terms of the initial design space size.\nThe proposed MFT optimization algorithm consists\nof two stages. The main structure of the brute-\nforce optimization used in each stage with certain\nmodiﬁcations is displayed in Fig. 1. This algorithm\nadopts all the good features of the proposed design\noptimization techniques available in literature [3]–\n[5] and uses them in combination. Furthermore, it\nallows more degrees of freedom in terms of geo-\nmetrical design considerations that have been over-\nlooked, thus enabling the algorithm to generate a\nmore diverse population of designs uncovering the\notherwise neglected design possibilities. This is en-\nabled using a transformation of the problem that de-\ncreases the number of the optimization variables,\ne.g. by treating the whole winding as a single ob-\nject instead of an array of turns.\nThe algorithm takes the available data-sheet inputs,\nelectrical and dielectric references and optimization\nvariables ranges (primary number of turns, current\ndensities, litz wire strand AWG and normalized ge-\nometrical proportions). The \"prepare data\" function\ngenerates the optimization space where each op-\ntimization variable vector variation corresponds to\na fully deﬁned single design. Winding losses and\nmagnetic energy are calculated using [6] and di-\nelectric distance between the windings is calculated\nto match the reference leakage inductance based\non the magnetic energy calculation.

Core losses [7], mass and volume calcula-\ntion is performed and ﬁnally the hot-spot tempera-\ntures are generated utilizing the developed thermal\nmodel (not discussed in this paper). Each design\nthat passes the feasibility check is saved into a de-\nsign database.\nAnother novelty of the proposed methodology lies\nin the data post processing treatment. In the ﬁrst\nstage of the optimization, all of the optimization vari-\nables are varied freely and thus all the mathemat-\nically feasible designs are exposed, as displayed\nwith circle markers in Fig. 2 where the color code\ncorresponds to the highest hot-spot temperature\nwithin the windings. These designs are then ﬁl-\ntered in terms of key performance indicators (e.g.\nefﬁciency, weight, volume, hot-spot temperature\nmargins etc.), as highlighted with black star mark-\ners. The ﬁltered designs are then analyzed against\navailable standard core and wire geometries and\nthe most similar components are selected. The\ndesign is re-optimized with ﬁxed discrete values\nof standard core and wire geometries and the re-\nsults are displayed relative to all possible solutions\nin Fig. 2 with red star markers. The user deﬁned\nperformance ﬁlters are again applied on the design\ndatabase with standard designs (green star mark-\ners) and the ﬁnal design is selected from this set,\nbased on the construction simplicity or other metric\n(purple star marker).\nThis method does not only bridge the gap between\nthe theoretical solutions and the ones that can be\nmade out of the standard components, but it also\nprovides an insight into where the solution utilizing\nwhich of the available hardware are positioned rela-\ntive to all possible theoretical designs in an intuitive\nway.\nHaving a full set of all possible solutions, provided\nby the brute force algorithm, allows to analyze all\ndifferent design alternatives in an arbitrarily nar-\nrowed down design space, depending on the set\nﬁlters. This makes the selection of the optimal solu-\ntion much easier and more intuitive compared to the\nanalysis of one or multiple sets of Pareto-optimal\nsolutions as would be the case with formal optimiza-\ntion algorithms.\nThe most popular Pareto front, related to the trade-\noff between efﬁciency and power density, is ex-\nposed at the upper edges of the feasibility sets of\nthe plots in Fig. 2. Its descending trend shows\nhow the price in efﬁciency must be paid in order\nto achieve a smaller design solution.\nPCIM Europe 2017, 16 – 18 May 2017, Nuremberg, Germany\nISBN 978-3-8007-4424-4\n© VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach\n425\n3. MFT Prototype\nApplying the described optimization process to a\ntransformer with electric speciﬁcations shown in Ta-\nble 1, an optimal MFT design is selected, as dis-\nplayed in Fig. 2. The realized prototype is an air\ninsulated and air cooled shell type MFT featuring\nsquare litz wire windings and N87 SIFERRIT cores.\nThe 3D CAD models are created in SOLIDWORKS,\naccording to the optimal design speciﬁcations gen-\nerated by the optimization algorithm. Primary and\nsecondary winding each consist of eight turns of\nthe square proﬁled (8.7x8.7 ± 0.2mm) copper litz\nwire with 1400 AWG 32 litz strands and a total cop-\nper crossection of 43.96mm2, wound on the cor-\nresponding coil formers, as displayed in Fig. 3a.\nThe primary and secondary coil formers have been\nproduced using additive manufacturing process (3D\nprinting) out of PA2200 high strength thermally re-\nsistant plastic. They have been designed and op-\ntimized in 3D SOLIDWORKS both to maximize the\nmechanical support strength and area for natural\nconvective air cooling of the windings with respect\nto the mechanical properties of the selected wire,\nas displayed in Fig. 3b. The MFT core is made of\n48 (12 x 4) SIFERRITE U-cores (UU9316 - CF139).\nThe realized 100kW MFT prototype is displayed in\nFig. 3c. Even though the prototype is almost iden-\ntical as the 3D CAD design, there exist a couple\nof small (measured in parts of mm) differences in\nthe geometry due to the precision limitations of the\ntechnological assembly process and material im-\nperfections which effect the electric parameters of\nthe MFT.\nDue to the brittle nature of ferrite materials and\nmanufacturing tolerances in terms of the surfaces\nand dimensions, mechanical amortization is neces-\nsary at every surface of contact with another solid\nmaterial. Due to this effect, there is a signiﬁcant dif-\nference between the reference magnetizing induc-\ntance from Table 1 and the one that was measured\non the MFT prototype (Lm = 750µF) as the width\nof the interfacing pad maintaining the air-gap dis-\ntance had to be chosen larger than calculated due\nto mentioned mechanical constraints.\nOn the other hand, bending of the large cross-\nsection litz wire is not a simple task and relatively\nlarge bending radiuses, that are hard to achieve\nin the corner regions of the winding, need to be\nconsidered in order to limit the bulging and twist-\ning effect of the wire. Consequently, there exists\nan offset in the winding placement of around 1mm\ncompared to the 3D CAD. Furthermore, the wire it-\nself has a slightly larger proﬁle than stated in the\ndata sheet. Consequently, the H ﬁeld distribution\nin the window area and the leakage inductance is\neffected. As a result, the measured leakage induc-\ntance (Lσ1 = Lσ2 = 4.2µH) is higher than the refer-\nence value from Table 1.\n(a)\n (b)\n (c)\nFig. 3: Optimal design resulting from the optimization algorithm: (a) MFT 3D CAD render (b) Primary and secondary\ncoil formers 3D CAD render (c) Realized MFT prototype\nPCIM Europe 2017, 16 – 18 May 2017, Nuremberg, Germany\nISBN 978-3-8007-4424-4\n© VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach\n426\n4. Experimental Veriﬁcation\n4.1. Dielectric Withstand Test\nIn order to verify the achieved insulation level, the\nMFT prototype was tested in a high voltage test\nsetup displayed in Fig. 5, normally used for AC di-\nelectric withstand and partial discharge tests. The\ntests were carried by applying the voltage: i) be-\ntween the primary and the secondary winding; ii)\nbetween the secondary winding and the conduc-\ntive parts of the MFT (top and the bottom heat-\nsinks and the vertical studs). The critical partial dis-\ncharge level (10pC) has been recorded at 4kV, ap-\nplied between the primary and the secondary wind-\nings. Due to mechanical imperfections of the MFT\nprototype, insulation level is slightly lower than ex-\npected.\n4.2. Resonant Test Setup\nIn order to carry out the electrical tests on the MFT\nprototype, a full power rated resonant test setup\nwas assembled. The electrical scheme of the test\nsetup and its physical layout inside the protective\ncage are displayed in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, respectively.\nThe setup consists of two H-bridge modules, one\nactively switched and the other operating as a\ndiode rectiﬁer, with their corresponding DC-bus ca-\npacitors, the resonant tank comprised of the MFT\nand the distributed resonant capacitors (C r1 and\nCr2) and two DC sources, one operated in volt-\nage (UDC1) and the other in current (I DC) control\nmode. The setup is operated as a resonant con-\nverter at the constant frequency fsw = 10kHz and\nwith the constant duty cycle D= 0.5. Positive ends\nof the DC-buses on the primary and secondary side\nare short circuited, whereas their negative ends are\nLσ1 Lσ2’Rσ1 Rσ2’\nLm\nN1:N2\nCr1\nMFT\nCr2\nIDC\nUDC1 1\n2\n3\n4\nI1 I2\nFig. 4: Electrical scheme of the test setup\nFig. 5: MFT dielectric withstand test\nFig. 6: Layout of the test setup within the protective cage\nconnected through a current source (I DC) thus al-\nlowing the circulation of the energy from the sec-\nondary side back to the primary side DC-bus, as\ndisplayed in Fig. 4.\nThe two H-bridges are physically realized by uti-\nlizing two phases of two three-phase SEMIKRON\nSkiip modules, as displayed in Fig. 6. The one on\nthe primary side is actively controlled via the optical\nPWM signals generated using the ABB AC 800PEC\nhigh performance controller with control functions\nprogrammed graphically in MATLAB Simulink using\nreal-time code generation.\nBoth primary (Cr1) and secondary (Cr2) capacitor of\nthe distributed resonant capacitor bank are realized\nas a parallel connection of eight (7x5µF+ 1x2.5µF)\nAC ﬁlm capacitors, held by bus-bars, giving a to-\ntal resonant tank capacitance of 18.75µF and con-\nsequently the resonant tank frequency of f0 =\n12.7kHz. Therefore, the desired sub-resonant con-\nPCIM Europe 2017, 16 – 18 May 2017, Nuremberg, Germany\nISBN 978-3-8007-4424-4\n© VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach\n427\nverter operation is achieved, providing soft switch-\ning turn-on for the primary side switches and zero\ncurrent switching for the secondary side diodes.\nAll devices within the protective test cage, two DC\nsources, 8-channel oscilloscope, and AC 800PEC\ncontroller, as displayed in Fig. 6, are connected\nthrough their ethernet connection to the multi-port\nactive switch communicating with the PC via the\noptical cable thus ensuring safety and complete\nelectrical decoupling of the operator from the high\npower test setup.\nVoltages on the AC side of the H-bridge converter\n(U12) and the diode rectiﬁer (U23) are measured to-\ngether with the resonant capacitor voltages on both\nthe primary (UCr1) and secondary (U Cr2) side, as\nwell as the primary (I 1) and secondary (I 2) reso-\nnant currents. Furthermore, the DC-bus voltages\non each Skiip module, and the output AC currents\nof the two converters are measured with additional\nsensors and used to implement safety features (e.g.\nover-voltage and over-current protection) within the\ncontroller software. Voltages and currents of both\nDC sources are monitored to evaluate the power in-\njected into the test setup, covering the total losses\nduring the operation. Temperature on the outer sur-\nfaces of the MFT are monitored with a laser thermal\nsensor to detect any dangerous overheating.\n-1000\n0\n1000\n-100\n0\n100\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n-200\n0\n200\nU12 [V]\nUCr1 [V]\nI1 [A]\nt [/uni03BCs]\n(a)\n-1000\n0\n1000\n-100\n0\n100\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n-200\n0\n200\nU23 [V]\nUCr2 [V]\nI2 [A]\nt [/uni03BCs] (b)\nFig. 7: Measured waveforms on the primary (a) and secondary (b) MFT side at nominal power: voltages on the\ninputs of the resonant tank (top), voltages on the resonant capacitors (middle) and resonant currents (bottom)\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\nPrimary Current [A]\n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\n200\n300\n  0%  20%  40%  60%  80% 100%\nt[/uni03BCs]\n(a)\nt[/uni03BCs]\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\nSecondary Current [A]\n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\n200\n300\n  0%  20%  40%  60%  80% 100% (b)\nFig. 8: Measured current waveforms on the primary (a) and secondary (b) side of the MFT at different loading\nconditions in range from 0% to 100% of the rated power\nPCIM Europe 2017, 16 – 18 May 2017, Nuremberg, Germany\nISBN 978-3-8007-4424-4\n© VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach\n428\n4.3. Measurements\nThe measured voltage and current waveforms, from\nthe primary and secondary side of the MFT at nom-\ninal power operation, are displayed in Fig. 7a and\nFig. 7b, respectively. Top plots show the voltage\nwaveforms on the output of the H-Bridge (U12) and\nthe input of the diode rectiﬁer (U 34). Primary side\nvoltage is regulated by DC voltage source UDC1 to\n750V. Middle plots show the voltages on the pri-\nmary (UCr1) and secondary (U Cr2) side resonant\ncapacitors. Bottom plots show the primary (I1) and\nsecondary (I2) resonant current waveforms. One\ncan observe that resonant tank current and capac-\nitor voltage are in quadrature, without any distor-\ntion, indicating well balanced operation. Resonant\ncurrent plots show that the resonant frequency cor-\nresponds to the calculated value (f 0) and that the\nsub-resonant switching is achieved as one of the\nmain conditions for soft switching operation. The\nmaximum switch-off current of the IGBTs is there-\nfore limited by the peak value of the magnetization\ncurrent (Immax = 25A).\nPlots of the primary and secondary resonant cur-\nrents, under various loading conditions ranging\nfrom 0% to 100% of the rated power, are displayed\nin Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b, respectively. Under no-load\nconditions, only the magnetizing current is present\nin the circuit. As the power transfer is increased,\ntypical resonant waveform is established with rms\nvalue proportional to the operating power level.\nDue to inability to reduce the dead time below the\n3µsset by the gate driver, it can be observed from\nFig. 7 that a minor and incomplete loss of the zero\nvoltage switching occurs at 100kW operating point.\nThis was not a major concern during MFT testing,\nconsidering that the resonant test setup was of suf-\nﬁcient ratings, and the objective of the paper is not\non the converter optimization.\nTotal losses of the whole resonant test setup can\nbe calculated from the voltage and current readings\non the two DC power supplies UDC1 and IDC. The\ntotal power injected into the setup at the nominal\npower was measured as2.9kW, indicating the over-\nall resonant converter efﬁciency of 97.1%. This is a\nreasonable result, taking into account that, with the\nexception of the MFT, the setup was not optimized\nfor the given operation.\nOn the other hand, it is hard to accurately separate\nthe losses using data from the conducted tests, thus\nmaking the exact estimation of the MFT efﬁciency\ndifﬁcult. However, by calculating the semiconductor\nlosses in the setup, considering well deﬁned oper-\nating conditions, they account to 2.2kW (this does\nnot include DC link and resonant capacitor losses).\nThus, the MFT efﬁciency can be estimated to be\nabove 99.3% at rated operating conditions.\n5. Conclusions\nA complete, brute force based, MFT design op-\ntimization process, relying on detailed analytical\nmodeling has been presented. Due to the lack\nof space, improved leakage inductance calculation\nand thermal model, develop by authors are not pre-\nsented in detail and will be documented in future\npublications. The results of the application of the\nproposed design procedure on a speciﬁc MFT de-\nsign requirements, have been illustrated and ana-\nlyzed in detail, exposing various design trade-offs\nthat must be carefully considered. While the design\ntool can develop, analyze and compare large num-\nber of designs (e.g. several hundred of thousands\nto couple of millions), ultimate selection of a design\nis left to the user, who is greatly assisted with devel-\noped ﬁlters, allowing easy and intuitive navigation\nthrough a design space.\nTo verify utilized modeling approaches and effec-\ntiveness of the design process, a100kW rated MFT\nprototype has been realized, using the standard off-\nthe-shelf components, based on the design speci-\nﬁcations generated by the algorithm. Despite the\nbest effort by the authors, mechanical imperfections\nand limitations of the integration process, have re-\nsulted in slight deviation of some electrical parame-\nters, providing useful feedback for improvements of\nrobustness of the optimization process.\nRealized MFT prototype has been successfully\ntested at various operating resonant conditions.\nTest results have conﬁrmed electrical performance\nin accordance with design speciﬁcations, achieving\nhigh efﬁciency without any thermal issues. There-\nfore, the developed design optimization procedure\nwas successfully veriﬁed, proving its usefulness\nand providing assurance for future designs.\nPCIM Europe 2017, 16 – 18 May 2017, Nuremberg, Germany\nISBN 978-3-8007-4424-4\n© VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach\n429\nReferences\n[1] J.
