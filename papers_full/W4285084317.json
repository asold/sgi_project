What may seem suitable in one \ncontext may not be appropriate in another context. The practices and tools used for the teacher \nevaluation can differ from instance to instance or from one university to another what is suitable \nfor one university may be less suitable for the another. Usmani and Khatoon (2018) stated that \nas per contemporary evaluation practices in Pakistan, it is identified that teacher evaluation was \nconducted at the institutional level only and even that was not systematic and aligned. Teacher \nevaluation is the least formal in the Pakistani context and, in past, it had not been conducted in \nmany public sector universities, but now HEC has made it the mandatory feature of the teaching \n \nGOMAL UNIVERSITY \nJOURNAL OF RESEARCH \nGomal University, Dera Ismail Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan \nISSN:1019-8180 (Print)                     ISSN: 2708 -1737 \n(Online) \n \n \n \n \n  Website  www.gujr.com.pk     HEC Recognized Social Sciences CrossRef DOI:10.5138\n0 \nRafiq, Qaisar & Butt … Analysis of Tools \nGomal University Journal of Research, Volume 38, Issue 2, JUNE, 2022       215 \nand learning process. The administrative heads and deans used different tools and instruments \nfor teacher self-appraisal and student rating of the teaching, even though these instruments may \ndiffer in terms of scope and worth and thus teachers’ evaluation is significant to enhance quality \nof teaching (Schafte, 2020). Many scholars have observed that existing teacher evaluation tools \nand procedures used in institutions are ambiguous and obsolete. It is thus essential to modify \nthese tools on a regular basis for improvement of teacher evaluation process (Blaskova, Blasko, \nMatuska & Szyrocka, 2015). Every institution needs to keep its employee’s performance at their \nbest.  \n \nLikewise, higher management in universities always actively looking for new ways of evaluating \nand improving their faculty members. For this, the comprehensive teacher evaluation tools and \ntechniques serve this purpose. Value-able feedback can be given to teachers based on evaluation \nresults (Bichi, 2017). This made it easier to make decisions, for example on terms of promotion \nor dismissals of teachers. Literature reveals that a well-designed teacher evaluation tool can lead \nto the desired results of quality assurance that an institute wants to achieve (Hammond, Hyler & \nGardner, 2017). It was also observed that techniques and tools used for the evaluation process \nare ineffective and outdated and procedure guidelines and parameters of evaluation should be \nrenewed after some time to get quality outcomes. (Muthuri, Momanyi & Nduku, 2019). Teacher \nevaluation is significant to enhance the quality of teaching and the worth of the institute because \nperformance of teachers is directly related to student achievement, so this can only be ensured \nby the use of appropriate teacher evaluation proce ss and tools. By end of 20th century, teacher \nevaluation was long ignored unspecified and unclear policy features and controversial issues, \nbut now it’s become popular and hot topic in education sector (Beauchamp, 2015). A well-known \nmechanism may empower teachers with teaching tactics, promote self-reflection and strengthen \ndiscussions about successful teaching skills amid teachers and administrators ( Taylor & Tyler, \n2012).  \n \nThe effectual evaluation tools may perform a key part in enhancing value of teach er evaluation \nprocess, however, there is a lot of work to be done at the academic and practical stages, and in \ndeveloping efficient teacher evaluation tools and implementation techniques. The worth of a \nvalid tool may also depend on its consistency and cohesiveness with an institute's vision mission \nand core academic goals (Looney, 2011). However, the key concept of evaluation and assessment \nmechanism is focused on the adherence to the criteria and standards prescribed by the system \nfor teacher evaluation tools. It is difficult to derive meaningful results about the progress of the \nteaching and learning process or to implement successful methods for teaching change if the \ntool is not properly aligned (Rafiq & Qaisar, 2021). In the education system of Pakistan, teacher \nevaluation is less concentrated . They also claimed that teacher evaluation never seems to work \nexcept as a waste of time at the higher education institutions ( Einbinder, 2018; Ellahi, 2018). \nTeacher evaluation is least formal in the Pakistani context and in past, it had not been conducted \nin many public sector universities, but now HEC has made it the mandatory feature of teaching \nand learning through quality enhancement cells (QEC). The teachers in Pakistan are evaluated \nby Universities QEC on the Performance Evaluation Report. So now, it is rapidly strengthening \nin the system, however, the problem of the dense mechanism and comprehensive tools is still \nthere.  \n \nThe teachers and management of higher education institutions are apprehensive about p resent \nteacher evaluation practices and tools presently being used at university level, although others \nRafiq, Qaisar & Butt … Analysis of Tools \nGomal University Journal of Research, Volume 38, Issue 2, JUNE, 2022       216 \nacknowledge this as means of enhancing teaching effectiveness and productivity. Many instructors \nare concerned that teacher evaluation tools and techniques are ambiguous and time-consuming \n(Crusan, Plakans & Gebril, 2016). The current evaluation tools create stress and concern among \nteachers in terms of how the evaluation findings will influence teachers and their performance. \nNumerous academicians believ e that most teachers do not have faith in evaluation tools and \nwonder how merely a few questions asked in the evaluation proforma can serve as the basis for \nmeasuring teaching effectiveness (Little, Goe & Bell, 2009; Shepard, 2017). Teacher evaluation \ntools used for this process have a crucial effect on efficiency of the teaching and learning process. \nMany teachers found claiming that existing tools and techniques of teacher evaluation, used in \nour universities are vague and outdated (Croft, Roberts & Stenhouse, 2015). Researcher himself \nalso observed this process very closely as researcher worked at three private sector universities \nin Pakistan. There is a huge difference in tools used for teacher evaluation at public and private \nuniversities. There is need to revise these tools on regular basis. In Pakistani context, still, there \nis no research conducted to analyze the teacher evaluation tools and techniques (Rafiq & Qaisar, \n2021). This study analyzes teacher evaluation tools used by many public and private universities in \nLahore. \n \nLITERATURE REVIEW \nEvaluation is a vital component of every educational society; it is backbone of any institution's \nor system's entire functioning. The evaluation has a regular component of every academic policy \nand is a tool for quality assurance and development for higher education institutions at national \nand international levels. Literature re veals that evaluation tools for educational institutes have \nbeen predominately designed by non-teaching staff and administrators, there is need to involve \nteachers in the organizing, designing, analyzing and execution of the teacher evaluation tools in \nthe universities (Lillejord, Elstad & Kavli, 2018). The involvement of educational specialists and \nteachers can play a vital role in success of evaluation tools development and refinement process \n(An, 2012). In the nutshell, teacher evaluation tools and instruments are powerful resources for \ndetermining efficacy and performance of teachers. To ensure teacher success, several countries \naround the world are adopting more robust assessment techniques and tools. Teachers involved \nin the development and creation of the tools and instruments of evaluation, seem to have a more \npositive attitude about the teacher evaluation process ( Golding & Adam, 2016). As a result, the \nuniversities are taking measures to evaluate the quality of teaching faculty as per guidelines and \ntools provided by HEC. Faculty members claim that these tools are vague and outdated and there \nis a need to benchmark these tools with w ell-reputed universities (Croft, Roberts & Stenhouse, \n2015). \n \nIt is, therefore, valuable to analyze the existing teacher evaluation tools adopted by public and \nprivate higher education institutions in Pakistan. The effective monitoring and evaluation of the \nteaching are central to the continuous improvement of effectiveness of teaching in a university \n(Avella, Kebritchi, Nunn & Kanai, 2016 ). It is essential to evaluate teacher itself along with the \nknowledge, teaching practices, and annual academic performance, to know which aspects could \nbe further developed. From this perspective, teacher evaluation tools are vital in drive to improve \neffectiveness of teaching and learning and raise educational standards ( Papay, 2012). Teacher \nevaluation is a constant chec k which is imposed upon university faculty members to maintain \nthe quality of teaching -learning. It may check teacher's self -perception about teacher quality, \nsimilarly, it may check students’ expectations from teacher, and the course delivered. Since we \nsee ourselves through the eyes of others and this perception is a critical part of self -motivation, \nRafiq, Qaisar & Butt … Analysis of Tools \nGomal University Journal of Research, Volume 38, Issue 2, JUNE, 2022       217 \ntherefore this perception must be managed in the fair and transparent way.  Many researchers \nagree that though there are few chances of ambiguity in the measu rement and interpretations \nof teacher evaluation tools and techniques, yet the well-structured evaluation system do provide \nsufficient information about ability of a teacher and can be used for assessing the necessary skills \nin a teacher (Smith, Cook, and Buskist, 2011; Galbraith, Merrill, and Kline, 2012; Gable & Wolf, \n2012).  \n \nSome of researchers argue that there is significant variance in reliability of teacher evaluation \ntools for good teaching and it ranges from total acceptance to total rejection, tha t is why these \nresearchers consider this issue a permanent source of conflict, specifically in higher education \n(Nasser & Fresko, 2002; Algozzine et al., 2004). Academicians believe that most of teachers do \nnot have faith in evaluation tools and wonder how merely the few questions asked in evaluation \nproforma can serve as basis for measuring teaching effectiveness . Some researchers are of the \nview that usually teachers do not like this evaluation system and they question that how only the \nfew questions asked in teacher evaluation tools can become base of decision about their teaching \nperformance (Beran & Rokosh 2009; Olsson & Roxå, 2008 ; Algozzine et al. , 2004). Beatrice \nAvalos, who has 13-year perspective on teacher evaluation complication, pointed out that conflicts \nbetween formative and summative aims exist not only in conception but also in the structure of \nthe tools utilized and information processing. As a result, tools for evaluation are also debatable. \nAs pointed to in the USA and Australian articles, standards tools provide needed quality (OECD, \n2013). Moreover, if the procedure to adopt tools is implemented incorrectly or inappropriately, \nit may be viewed as a failure of whole process of the teacher evaluation (Campbell & Derrington, \n2017). \n \nMany researchers of technically advanced countries argue that establishing a teacher evaluative \nculture depends upon providing the appropriate tools which may help teachers to take charge \nof their improvement (Kraft & Gilmour, 2016 ). To make process strengthen, ma ny researchers \nhighlighted that teacher evaluation complexities might be removed if teaching leadership support \nthe process because they have the potential to rectify issues involved in teacher evaluation tools \nand techniques if these tools are revisited from time to time. Teacher evaluation tools, according \nto Papay (2012), should be assessed not just on their effectiveness in correctly measuring teacher \nperformance, but on how well they inform and assist in continuing teacher growth.  Developing \nand adopting a systemwide change, such as teacher evaluation tools, can be politically difficult. \nIn order to establish what constitutes excellent teaching and choose acceptable instruments for \ngathering reliable data, technical competence is necessary. Teachers in many countries report \nthat unfortunately teacher evaluations are not conducted systematically, major reason is that \nevaluators may not be trained or may use useless tools and that expert learning and growth are \noften not aligned with their needs ( Flores & Derrington, 2018). The main objective of research \nwas to analyze tools used for teacher evaluation process in public and private universities of \nLahore. \n \nSignificance of Study \nThis study is important because it may provide valuable information about the effectiveness and \nefficiency of tools used for the teacher evaluation process at public and private universities in \nLahore. It may serve as a resource material for others who want to carry out research in related \nareas. Specifically, it will guide management of the university to develop better evaluation tools \nand mechanisms for the teacher evaluation. In this connection, it may provide information and \nRafiq, Qaisar & Butt … Analysis of Tools \nGomal University Journal of Research, Volume 38, Issue 2, JUNE, 2022       218 \nguidelines to university administration to modify the criterion to assess performance of quality \nteaching. In this connection, this research may also provide a pathway for potential researchers \nto conduct studies in this field to check, verify, and recommend the various aspects of current \nresearch. \n \nMETHODOLOGY & PROCEDURE \nThe research paradigms explain the rationale for choosing one research technique over another. \nBecause it is journey from ideas to acts, a researcher's techniques are governed by philosophical \nand functional needs. For this study, researcher utilized interpretive paradigm. The interpretive \nparadigm is focused on comprehending the world via sensory experiences of humans. They rely \non subjective interaction between researcher and participants to use meaning-focused procedures \nincluding interviews, participant observation and document analysis rather than measurement- \nfocused approaches. Thus, based on the qualitative approach the researcher used the document \nanalysis technique to analyze the tools used for conducting the teacher evaluation process at the \npublic and private universities in Lahore. According to Love (2013) document analysis is a classy \ntechnique that utilizes preordained  parameters and aims to examine the documents. The data \nwas collected from two universities with equal proportionate (50%). The aim was to assess how \nmuch public and private universities have followed the tools used for this process. This approach \nhelped the researcher to understand the clear picture of the teacher's evaluation process through \nits tools.  \n \nData Source \nTwo public and two private sector general universiti es of Lahore were purposively selected and \ntheir teacher evaluation tools were taken for this research study. These tools were collected after \nvisiting the respective university’s human resource/registrar’s office and quality enhancement \ncells. In this connection, some of them were also available on official website of the universities. \nThere were total three documents and their tyles like self -appraisal form of private universities \n(25%), annual confidential report/performanxe evaluation report of public s ector universities \n(25%) and teacehrs’ evaluations by students’ form of public and private universities (50%). In \nthis linking, the lists of the documents that have been selected to review for this research were as \nfollows; \n1. Tools used for teacher evaluation in public sector university 1.  \n Teacher Annual Confidential Report/ Performance Evaluation Report  \n Teacher Evaluation by Students Form \n2.

The criteria met the objective of the study of analyzing the tools \nRafiq, Qaisar & Butt … Analysis of Tools \nGomal University Journal of Research, Volume 38, Issue 2, JUNE, 2022       219 \nused for teacher evaluation process. The documents were retrieved from official resources of the \nabove-mentioned institutions and departments. All tools were official documents. Tools were \nreviewed, compared, and analyzed as per criteria depicted in table below. The researcher abides \nby the austere ethical considerations for conducting this research study as described by (Arifin, \n2018).  \n \nFigure 1 \nFramework of Document Analysis \n \n \nTable 1  \nDocument Analysis of Self-Assessment Proforma \nParticulars PBL-University 1 PBL-University 2  PVT-University 1 RVT-University 2 \nDocument Type Official Official Official Official \nDeveloped by Registrar Office Registrar Office HRD HRD \nPages 3 3 3 5 \nDemographic 3 3 4 6 \nParts 2 2 5 7 \nMajor Sections  Teaching \n Research  \n Teaching \n Research \n Teaching  \n Research \n Activity Profile \n Self-Evaluation \n Remarks Head \n Remarks Dean \n Teaching \n Knowledge  \n Research \n Services  \n Strengths \n Future Aims \n Supervisor  \nTime Period Once in a Year Once in a Year End of every Year End of every Year \n \nDocument Analysis of SA/ACR of Public & Private Universities  \nThe proformas of self-appraisal/annual confidential report of sampled public and private sector \nuniversities were analyzed over document analysis. Both proformas of public sector universities \nwere official documents that were taken from Registrar Office special/record branch of sampled \nuniversities. Whereas proformas of private sector universities were taken from human resource \ndepartment of private universities, both proformas were official documents and also available on \ntheir websites. Those Proforma of Self-appraisal/Annual Confidential Report had developed by \n\nRafiq, Qaisar & Butt … Analysis of Tools \nGomal University Journal of Research, Volume 38, Issue 2, JUNE, 2022       220 \nevery university on its own, not adopted from anywhere. The public sector universities had three, \nthree demographic questions in their proforma that were name of faculty member, designation, \nand department, and both consisted of three, three pages. While, both private sector universities \nhad four and six demographic questions in their proforma respectively. Demographic questions \nof the first priva te sector university were Teacher N ame, designation, academic year, date and \nconsisted of three pages. In this connection, t he other private universit ies had name, position, \nfaculty/school, name of the head, joining date, and period of evaluation and it consisted of five \npages.  \n \nIt was highlighted that both the public sector universities had two sections in their proforma of \nself-appraisal/annual confidential report that include teaching and research. These two sections \nhad also different subsections regarding teaching and research activities. The other two private \nsector universities had five and seven main sections in their proformas respectively. The first \nprivate sector university sections consist of the summary of teaching and other skills, Research \nand other activities, activity profile, overall self-evaluation, and remarks of the Head/Dean. The \nsecond private sector university sections consist of the teaching knowledge updation, research, \nservices to students, strengths, future aims, and supervisor re marks. It was also noted that the \nactivity of the self-appraisal/annual confidential report is held once a year in the public sector \nuniversities whereas, in the private sector, it is conducted at the end of every year normally in \nDecember. \n \nTable 2  \nDocument Analysis of Student Evaluation of Teacher’s Proforma \nParticulars PBL-University \n1 \nPBL-University \n2 \nPVT-University \n1 \nRVT-University \n2 \nDocument Type Official Official Official Official \nDemographic  5 5 5 5 \nScale Likert-Scale Likert-Scale Likert-Scale Likert-Scale \nIndicators in Tool 2 2 4 4 \nName of Indicators  Instructor \n Course \n Instructor \n Course \n Quality  \n Courses \n Examination \n Contribution  \n Designing  \n Learning  \n Class Control \n Assessment  \nItems of Each Indicator 13 \n05 \n13 \n05 \n08 \n05 \n05 \n05 \n08 \n08 \n07 \n06 \nTotal Item Statements 18 18 23 29 \nOpen-ended Questions  02 02 03 03 \nDeveloped By  Adopted of HEC  Adopted of HEC  Developed QEC Developed QEC \n \nDocument Analysis of Teacher Evaluation by Students  \nTeacher evaluation proforma of sampled public and private sector  universities were analyzed \nthrough document analysis. All the proformas were official documents that were taken from the \nquality enhancement cell of the sampled universities. Analysis of documents showed that public \nsector universities adopted the higher education commission proforma of teacher evaluation as \nit is. Whereas, private sector universities developed their own proforma of teacher evaluation \nRafiq, Qaisar & Butt … Analysis of Tools \nGomal University Journal of Research, Volume 38, Issue 2, JUNE, 2022       221 \nby students with the involvement of QEC. It was identified that the sampled public and private \nuniversities had five demographic questions in their proforma of teacher evaluation which were \ncourse title and code, name of instructor, semester, department, and degree program. All the \nproformas of public and private sector universities were measured on Liker -scale 1 to 5 points \nwhere 1 strongly disagreed and 5 strongly agreed. Further, it was pointed out that both public \nsector universities had only two teacher performance indicators that were instructor and course, \nwhile both private sector universities had four, four teacher performance indicators which were \nquality of teaching, courses, examination & assessment, and student contribution and other four \nwere designing and planning instruction, learning environment, class control and assessment & \nevaluation.  \n \nOne teacher performance indicator “instructor” of the both public sector universities had thirteen \nitem statements in their teacher evaluation proforma and second teacher performance indicator \n“course” had only five -item statements. Whereas, one private sector  university had eight -item \nstatement of their first teacher evaluation indicator “quality of teaching” the second indicator \n“courses” had five -item statements, third indicator “examination & assessment” also had five \nitems statements, fourth indicator stud ent’s contribution had five -item statements. The other \nprivate sector university had eight -item statements of their firs t teacher evaluation indicator \ndesigning and instructions second indicator “learning environment” had eight-item statements, \nthird indicator “class control” had seven-item statements, and the fourth indicator “assessment \nand evaluation” had six-item statements in their proforma of teacher evaluation by students. It \nwas noted that both public sector universities had a total of eighteen, eig hteen item statements \nin proforma of teacher evaluation. Other private universities had twenty-three and twenty-nine \nitems’ statements in proforma of teacher evaluation respectively. It was dyed that both public \nsector universities had only two, two open-ended questions/ in the teacher evaluation proformas, \nwhereas the other two private sector universities had there, three open-ended questions in their \nproforma.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe main objective of this study was to critically analyze the tools used for teacher evaluation in \npublic and private universities of Lahore. The teacher’s evaluation tools were analyzed through \ndocument analysis. It is identified that teacher evaluation tools of private sector universities \nwere more comprehensive than of the public sec tor universities of Lahore. These results were \nalso supported by the study titled “teachers' performance evaluations and development systems \namong higher education institutes of Pakistan” conducted by Chaudhry (2017). In this linking, \nthe results of this article pointed out that private universities have more teacher teaching aspects \nin their teacher evaluation tools instead of public sector universities. In this connection, it was \nalso highlighted that these aspects have more item statements/ questions as compared to public \nsector universities. Consequently, these findings were also supported by study titled “mentoring \nthe tool of teacher development and assessment”  in diverse contexts by Jan (2007) and Aslam \n(2011).  \n \nIt was also noted that tools of teacher evaluation by students have few open-ended questions in \ntheir proformas. All the proformas of teacher evaluation by students were measured on a Likert \nscale. It was analyzed that the public sector universities adopted higher education commission, \nPakistan’s tools of teacher evaluation whereas, private sector universities had self -developed \ntheir tools of teacher evaluation. Near-about findings were reported in study titled “Educational \nRafiq, Qaisar & Butt … Analysis of Tools \nGomal University Journal of Research, Volume 38, Issue 2, JUNE, 2022       222 \nevaluation in Pakistani higher education context carried by (Usmani & Khatoon, 2013). Findings \nof this study also reported that teacher self -appraisal/ annual confidential report proformas of \nprivate sector universities were more detailed having more aspects of teacher’s teaching, while \nthe public sector universities used only single page proforma. This research revealed that teacher \nself-appraisal/Annual confidential report is being conducted once a year in the sampled public \nsector universities from June to December. Whereas, in private sector universities teacher self -\nappraisal is conducted at the end of every year normally in December. A close finding was also \nreported in the study titled “A critical analysis of performance appraisal system for teachers in \nthe public sector universities of Pakistan” carried out by (Rasheed, Yousaf & Noor, 2011; Yunus \n2018). \n \nCONCLUSION \nIt is concluded that teacher evaluation tools of private sector universities were comprehensive \nand updated as compared to public sector universities of Lahore. It was highlighted that public \nsector universities adopted higher education commission, Pakistan’s tools of teacher evaluation \nwhereas, private sector universities had self-developed tools of teacher evaluation. An important \nthing pointed that the tools of the public sector universities had very limited aspects of teacher’s \nteaching evaluation while private sector universities had more aspects in their tools than public \nsector. Moreover, it was revealed that teacher evaluation tools of private sector universities shed \ncomplete light on the teachers’ teachings. They used to update and detailed proformas for teacher \nevaluation, whereas the public sector universities are using single page proforma’s for teacher \nevaluation, which has only one or two aspects of teacher’s teachings. After critical analysis of the \ntools, it seems teacher evaluation in public sector universities is just a formality as reported by \n(Rafiq & Qaisar, 2021). While in the public sector it’s a serious practice. Researchers concluded \nthat there is a need for serious focus to revise the t eacher evaluation tools of the public sector \nuniversities. There is also need to include more aspects of teacher teaching in the tools of public \nsector universities. For this purpose, teacher evaluation tools might be benchmarked with some \ngood national an d international reputed universities. This will luster whole process of teacher \nevaluation.  \n \nRecommendations \n Teacher evaluation tools should be revised on regular basis in public sector universities. \n There should be more aspects/indicators and questions of teacher’s teachings in teacher \nevaluation tools of public and private sector universities.  \n Teacher evaluation tools of public sector universities should be benchmarked with some \ngood reputed national international universities. \n The proforma of self-appraisal/annual confidential reports should comprise questions \nabout teachers’ annual performance. \n There should be more open -ended questions in teacher evaluation tools of public and \nprivate sector universities. \n The teacher evaluation can also be checked with the addition of some new and innovative \ntools. \n \nREFERENCES \nAlgozzine, B., Beattie, J., Bray, M., Flowers, C., Gretes, J., Mohanty, G., & Spooner, F.
