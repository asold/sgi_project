  "abstract": "Accurate earthwork quantity estimation is essential for effective project planning and cost management in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Traditional methods for quantity takeoff are often time-consuming and susceptible to human error, particularly when working with unstructured datasets such as CAD drawings. This study introduces the Earthwork Network Architecture (ENA), a novel deep learning framework that incorporates Large Language Models (LLMs), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers to automate and enhance the accuracy of earthwork quantity estimation. We assume that if LLMs can be trained effectively using such unstructured construction dataset, the effects such as improved accuracy and the challenges of LLMs can be clearly examined. Among the architectures tested, the LLM-based ENA demonstrated superior performance, achieving faster convergence, greater loss reduction, and higher classification accuracy, with a Quantity Takeoff Classification accuracy of 97.17%. However, the LLMs required significantly more computational resources compared with other models. These findings suggest that LLMs, typically used in natural language processing, can be effectively adapted for complex AEC datasets. This study lays the groundwork for future AI-driven solutions in the AEC industry, underscoring the potential of LLMs and Transformers to automate the quantity takeoff process and manage multimodal data in construction projects.",
