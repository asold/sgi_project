  "abstract": "The article presents a method of determining dielectric losses that occur in insulating materials in a power transformer. These losses depend mainly on the electric field stress, pulsation, dielectric loss coefficient, and electrical permittivity of insulating materials. These losses were determined by integrating an expression describing unit losses. The determined dielectric losses were compared with the total losses of the transformer. It turned out that dielectric losses are a fraction of a percent of the total losses. The influence of the electrical permittivity of the insulating liquid and paper insulation on the value of dielectric losses was investigated. This influence was ambiguous, which is characteristic of stratified systems made of materials with different permittivity. An analysis of the influence of the dielectric loss coefficient tan(delta) on the value of dielectric losses in the transformer was carried out. The impact of this coefficient on the amount of dielectric losses turned out to be directly proportional.",
