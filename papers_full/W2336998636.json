    "full_text": "Tool use by Choerodon cyanodus when handling vertebrate prey\nThe use of an anvil during prey handling fulﬁls the criteria of tool use and\ncan be considered a sign of intelligence (Jones et al. 2011). Tool use has\nonly recently been described for ﬁshes and is currently limited to wrasses\nhandling invertebrate prey (e.g., breaking open cockles and bivalves; Jones\net al. 2011;B e r n a r d i2012). Here, we extend this behaviour to a further\ntuskﬁsh species and provide the ﬁrst documentation of this behaviour for a\nvertebrate prey item.\nOn 13 February 2014, at ~0850 h a remotely deployed video camera\nserendipitously ﬁlmed an adult blue tuskﬁsh ( Choerodon cyanodus ) with a\njuvenile green turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) in its mouth on the shallow (<2 m)\nouter reef ﬂat around Heron Island, Great Barrier R eef, Australia. Cho-\nerodon cyanodus has previously been documen ted as a major predator of\nturtles on this reef (Gyuris 1994), but how the tuskﬁsh handles this prey\nitem has not been recorded. Our 23-s sequence shows the tuskﬁsh repeatedly\nusing a small rock as an anvil while in both sideways and head-down body\npositions (Fig. 1; Electronic Supplementary Material). The tuskﬁsh also\nuses a larger, dead coral formation as a second anvil for additional strikes.\nThe blows either stun or kill the turtle as ﬂipper movement seen at\nthe start of the sequence is no longer visible when the ﬁsh exits the\nframe.\nIt is unknown whether the use of the anvil was just to incapacitate the\nturtle to aid prey handling or whether it also functioned to break open the\ncarapace to help with swallowing and digestion. However, this behaviour\ns h o w st h a tt o o lu s em a yi n d e e db ep a r t i c u l a r l yc o m m o ni nt h ea n c e s t r a l\nChoerodon genus and potentially a deep-seated behavioural trait in wrasses\n(Bernardi 2012), and used for a wider range of prey items than previously\nknown. Whether this behaviour extends to other groups of ﬁshes, allowing\nthem to eat prey items larger than thei r gape size, remain s a tantalising\nquestion.\nAcknowledgments ARH was funded by Australian Research Council fel-\nlowship DE120102459.
