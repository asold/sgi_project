Introduction \nIt is common knowledge that the performance of Anglophone Secondary school students in English Language both \nin everyday communication and examinations have experien ced decline over the years.  The climax was the very \npoor performances registered in the G.C.E. O/L English la nguage examination of 2014 where there was a meagre 13% \nsuccess for a subject which constitutes a basic univers ity entry requirement for many Anglo-Saxon based \nUniversities for this group of students. As if this was not bad enough, the newly introduced Advanced level English \nlanguage paper of 2015 G.C.E. examination produced an ev en worse result with a maiden attempt performance of 8% \npass in the subject. The intriguing situation is the fact that, English language is the medium through which all the \nother school certificate subjects are taught and learnt. It is assumed that a better mastery of English language will \ngreatly enhance comprehension and performances in the other subjects and permit these users to function well in this \ncountry where English and French are official languages superposed on about 273 indigenous languages.  \nFurthermore, the deplorable situation in the performance of  English language provokes thoughts and investigations \ninto a number of factors all geared towards possibilities of ev entually redressing the situation. This is to be done so \nthat there will be a fostering of the communication skills of users for better performance and usage and permitting \nthem to function more appropriately in the globalized world where English language is a leading medium of \ncommunication. It is from this back drop that this paper sets out to investigate the various models employed in the \nteaching of English language with a focus on an appr aisal of The Competence Based Language Teaching (CBLT) \nmodel recently introduced in 2012 in Cameroon. In essen ce, there is the need to describe and highlight the \ncontributions of the various models in the teaching of English, the problems encountered by each model and steps \nwhich were undertaken to redress such problems and of greater relevance, there is the need to present an appraisal of \nthe newly introduced CBLT model to see whether it is actually functioning to address the language needs of our \nstudents.  \n \nhttp://wje.sciedupress.com World Journa l of Education V ol. 6, No. 2; 2016 \nPublished by Sciedu Press                         5 1                           ISSN 1925-0746  E-ISSN 1925-0754  \n2. Description of the Various Models \nVarious models or Approaches have been employed and emphasized in the business of teaching languages in \ndifferent parts of the world at different times and various degrees or levels of successes have been registered \naccording to the needs emphasized. Some of such models  include the Grammar Tran slation, the Direct, the \nCommunicative, the Audio-Lingual, the Bilingual, the Michael West or New Model, and the Competence Based \nApproach or model. In this study, the focus will be on four models which have been very prominent in the \nCameroonian scenario in the teaching of English language. These include th e Grammar-Translation, the Direct, the \nCommunicative and the Competence Based Language Teaching Models.  \n2.1 Grammar-Translation Model \nThe classical or Grammar-Translation model represents the tradition of language teaching adopted in Western \nsocieties and developed over centuries of teaching not only the classical languages such as Latin and Greek but also \nforeign languages. It remained popular in modern language pedagogy, even after the introduction of newer methods. \nThe procedure in this method is such that the learner’s first language for example French or German is used as the \nmeans of translating to the target language (say English). In this approach, the teacher’s role is central as he or she is \nlooked upon as a model to be imitated. The model emphasises the teaching of grammar and vocabulary. This is done \nthrough the teaching of prescriptive grammar in a deductive manner through the presentation of grammatical rules \nand vocabulary in the form of list of words presented out of context and grouped thematically for students to \nmemorise.  \nThe meaning of words are learnt through translation into the mother tongue or first language. There is little active \nuse of the target language as classes are in the students’ mother tongue. There is also the study of the form and \ninflection of words. Reading of difficult text is begun earl y in the course of study. Little attention is paid to the \ncontent of texts, which are treated as exercises in grammatical analysis. The only drills most often used, are exercises \nin translating disconnected sentences from the target lang uage into the mother tongue and vice versa. There is little \nor no attention provided for the development of pronunciation skills.  \nAccording to Kumaravadivelu’s (1993) classification, this approach falls under language centred methods because its \nfocus is principally with linguistic forms. This approach which could also be termed a content based approach seeks \nto provide opportunities for learners to practice preselected, pre-sequenced linguistic structures through form focused \nexercises in class, assuming that a preoccupation with form will ultimately lead to the mastery of the target language \nand that the learners can draw from this formal repertoire whenever they wish to communicate in the target language \noutside the class. From this perspective, language development is more intentional than incidental. In other words, \nlearners are expected to pay continual and conscious attention to linguistic features through systematic planning and \nsustained practice in order to learn and to use them. Grammar Translation approach give priority to grammatical \nCompetence as the basis of Language proficiency. Grammar rules could be learnt through a methodology that makes \nmuch use of repetitive practice and drilling. Great atten tion is paid to accurate mastery of grammar from the \nbeginning phases of language learning. The methodology employed is structural which has to do with presentation, \npractice and production. The target grammar structure is presented often by means of a short text. The students \npractise using the new structure in a controlled context th rough drills or substitution exer cises. In production, the \nstudents produce using the new structure in different context, often using content provided by the teacher.  \n2.1.1 The Grammar-Translation Model in Cameroon \nThis model was advocated and practised  in the teaching of English language  to Anglophone Secondary School \nstudents (our focus in this study) by language pedagogues till the late seventies. In investigating this aspect of this \nstudy, a total of four regional pedagogic inspectors, two each from the North West and South West regions and one \nNational inspector for English language alongside twenty  teachers from both regions in the business of English \nlanguage teaching for more than twen ty five years as well as ten retired English teachers inte rviewed for this \nresearch reported as follows:  \n1. They explained that, the students taught through the Grammar Translation Model came from diverse \nlinguistic background wher eby the different Cameroonian Langua ges constituted their various mother \ntongues and some also had a good mastery of the lingua franca pidgin English spoken in Cameroon. They \nall had carried out primary school studies in English. At the secondary school level, teaching and learning of \nEnglish language through the Grammar-Translation Model emphasized the aspect of a good mastery of the \ngrammar rules of English to the extent of rote memo rization of such rules; there was vocabulary study as \nwell as the study of complex literary texts. There we re no translation from one language to another. \nhttp://wje.sciedupress.com World Journa l of Education V ol. 6, No. 2; 2016 \nPublished by Sciedu Press                         5 2                           ISSN 1925-0746  E-ISSN 1925-0754  \nHowever, the aspect of translation involved the teachin g of English to Francophon e students whereby this \nrequired the movement from French to English and vice versa.  \n2. The Grammar-Translation Model enforced the systematic study of grammatical rules which helped in \nfostering students’ ability of reading comprehension and producing grammatically correct sentences. They \nreported that the skills were developed more in writing than in speaking. They also observed that the \nknowledge of grammatical rules aided in making communication intelligible. \nThey further pointed out that, there was much emphasises on the use of literary texts and acknowledged the fact that \nthese texts provided the situation in which reading and writing abilities were developed. They observed with great \ndismay that, this model’s major limitation was the emphasis on the learning of grammatical rules which were not \napplied in real life communication situations.  \nIn other words, reading and writing skills were enhanced to  the detriment of listening and speaking skills. The texts \nused were mostly taken from literary  works, which most often did not meet  the practical ever yday needs of the \nlearners. The environment outside the classroom did not employ the use of English language so there was no place to \npractice the rule of grammar to increas e proficiency in the language. This model was eventually abandoned for a \nmodel which emphasized communication in real life situations.  \n2.2 The Direct Method \nThe fact that the Grammar-Translation approach did not emphasize oral communication and the application of \nEnglish language in real life situations it was discarded as an approach for teaching English. The next model \nembraced for the teaching of English was the Direct Method or Approach. This  approach has many names. It is \ncalled the ‘reform’ method, the ‘natural’ method, the ‘psychological’ method, the ‘phonetic’ method, and \n‘anti-grammatical’ method. It was first established in France and Germany around 1 900. The major assumptions \nwere in opposition to the grammar-translation and had distinct grammatical bias. It is a logical extension of the \nNatural method an offshoot of the Behaviourist school of psychology. It insists on the fact that the key to all \nlanguage learning lies in association. It stresses the need for direct association between experience and expression in \nthe foreign language.  \nThe aim is to enable the learner to think in the foreign language and to cultivate an unerring language sense. It \nrecognizes that language sense has its roots in the spoken language and lays stress on the oral approach. Meanings of \nwords for example should be ta ught by direct association through giving synonyms, defi nitions, explanations or by \ninference to the context. There should be no recourse to translations for indirect learning.  \nAnother significant assumption of this model include the fact that adult L2 learners could learn a second language in \nessentially the same manner as children do. The teacher here , is expected to create a na tural learning environment \nwithin the classroom and instead of explicit grammar instruction, the major emphasis is on communication through \nquestion-and-answer dialogues. The teacher was the expert and the students had to imitate him. This presented a \ngreat weakness in the Cameroonian situation because of the lack of dearth of the expert teachers.  \nThe oral practice was limited to the classroom setting such th at outside, there were no real  avenues to continue with \nthe practice. Moreover, a total abandon ment of the grammar rules in an environment where English is not the \nindigenous language started the deficiencies which have cumulated over the years. As opined by Verghese (1989) \nanother limitation of this model, arises from its neglect  of the language Skills like writing and reading because of \noveremphasis on oral work.  \nThe next model which immediately followed the Direct Method in the Cameroonian language teaching scene was the \nCommunicative language Teaching Model. Like the Direct Method, it also emphasized oral skills, but at the same \ntime highlighted certain communication functions. \n2.3 The Communication Language Teaching Model \nThis model as observed by Essossomo (2013) advocated th e teaching of language for communicative purposes and \nnot only for the sake of passing examinations. There was the need to learn enough realistic whole language \nintroducing innovative classroom activities like games, ro le play and scenarios aimed at sustaining learner \nmotivation (Kumaravadivlu, 2006). The model has evolved to incorporate basic grammatical principles in \nperforming communicative functions.  \nThis approach seeks to provide opportunities for learners to practice preselected, pre sequenced linguistic structures \nand communicative notions/functions through meaning-focuse d activities, assuming that a preoccupation with form \nhttp://wje.sciedupress.com World Journa l of Education V ol. 6, No. 2; 2016 \nPublished by Sciedu Press                         5 3                           ISSN 1925-0746  E-ISSN 1925-0754  \nand function will ultimately lead to target language mastery and that the learners can make use of both formal and \nfunctional repertoire to fulfil their communicative needs outside the class. (Kumaravadivelu, 2008). \nHymes, (1972) cited in Essossomo (2013) mentions some criteria by which communicative competence can be \nevaluated. These include the formal po ssibility connected to grammaticality, appropriateness linked to sociocultural \nacceptability, and the actual performance.  \nHere, classroom activities seek to develop students ’ communicative competence th rough linking grammatical \ndevelopment to the ability to communicate. Therefore, gramma r is not taught in isolation but often arises out of a \ncommunicative task, thus creating a need for specific items of grammar. Students might carry out a task and then \nreflect on some of the linguistic ch aracteristics of their performance. Th ey create the need for communication, \ninteraction, and negotiation of meaning through the use of activities such as problem solving, information sharing, \nand role play. They provide opportunities for both inductive as well as deductive learning of grammar. They make \nuse of content that connects to students’ lives and interests. They allow students to personalize learning by applying \nwhat they have learned to their own lives. Classroom materials typically make use of authentic texts to create interest \nand to provide valid models of language. \nThe advantages of this model include the fact that; \nThe learner is at the centre and takes on more responsib ilities. Students have the opportunity to construct knowledge \nthemselves and this gives meaning to learning. Here, the learner has the responsibility not just to learn how to \ncommunicate but equally to learn the grammar of the language in order for communication to be more intelligible.  \nIt involves varied kind of activities that avoid monotony and boredom, while helping to improve students’ \nproficiency. It is task based as students learn through carrying out various communicative tasks.  \nGrammatical and communicative competences are two sides of  the same coin. These two aspects of language work \nhand in glove to better content mastery and communication. It is not just about learning to communicate but also \nlearning to communicate while using the language appropriately.  \nGrammar teaching and learning is both inductive and de ductive. Here, it is not one way like in the Grammar \nTranslation method where it was just deductive teaching of grammar and rules just presented to students nor the \nDirect Method which emphasised speech to  the neglect of grammar rules. In th is case, students also formulate the \nrules themselves and these help to develop their thinking abilities.  \nNotwithstanding the great improvements in this approach, it has a handicap in that it is time consuming and difficult \nto effectively implement in a context like Cameroon with large class sizes and other factors like multiple languages \noutside the classroom. Essossomo (2013 pp. 90-92) believes the application of CLT in Cameroon is not effective \nbecause of Examination/tests-oriented teaching, overcrowded classrooms, limited teaching hours (time constraints), \nthe influence of background languages, lack of necessary resources and some social constraints like high familial, \nlearners and school authorities’ expectations for academi c success. Most course instructors teach English under \npressure from the school authorities. In the teaching activity, they should in corporate only aspects that can help \nstudents to better tackle questions in the official examinat ions with relative ease. Most teachers generally report that \nwhenever they incorporate communicative activities in the teach ing process, they are treate d as “irresponsible”. The \nproduct of these deficiencies was the fact that English la nguage was taught more for the sake of acquiring certificate \nto the detriment of applying the knowledge for developing life skills for survival. Due to this, there was need to \nchange orientation to embrace a model which emphasise Co mpetency. This resulted to the birth of the Competence \nBased Approach (CBA) in Cameroon. According to J.C Bipoupout (2007), the CBA was prescribed to Cameroon \nfollowing research work, global comparisons and the activities of the international organisations in support of \nresponsive educational systems. \n2.4 Competency Based Approach \nThe Competency Based Approach, al so known as Competency Based E ducation (CBE), Competency Based \nLearning (CBL), Pedagogy of Integration, Performance Based Approach, Proficiency Based Approach, Mastery \nBased Approach and an Outcome Approach, began in USA in the 1970s , was introduced in the United kingdom in \n1986 (Auerbach 1986:411-412) and was introduced in Cameroon in 2012. The application of its principles to \nlanguage teaching is called competency -based language teaching ( CBLT). It seeks to teach students the basic skills \nthey need in order to prepare them for situations they commonly encounter in everyday life.  \nJack C. Richards (2001) is of the opinion that there are two things to note about competency-based instruction. First, \nit seeks to build more accountability into education by describing what a course of instruction seeks to accomplish. \nhttp://wje.sciedupress.com World Journa l of Education V ol. 6, No. 2; 2016 \nPublished by Sciedu Press                         5 4                           ISSN 1925-0746  E-ISSN 1925-0754  \nSecondly, it shifts attention away from methodology or classroom processes, to learning outcomes. He says in a \nsense, one can say that with this approach it doesn’t matter what methodology is employed what matters is the fact \nthat it delivers the learning outcomes.  \nAccording to the glossary of educational reforms, CBA or CBL refers to systems of instruction, assessment, grading \nand academic reporting that are based on students demonstr ating that they have learned the knowledge and skills \nexpected of them as they progress thr ough their education. Accordingly, the goal of CBA is to ensure that students \nare acquiring the knowledge that are deemed to be essential to success in  school, higher education, careers and adult \nlife and if students fail to meet up w ith expectations, they receive additi onal instruction, practice and academic \nsupport to help them achieve compet ency. The Glossary theories state th at when schools implement CBA, it can \nentail significant changes in how the school operates, affecting the school’s educational philosophy and culture to its \nmethods of instruction, testing, grading, promotion and graduation.  \nCBA refers to teaching and learning that focuses on targeted competencies which are linked to the everyday needs of \nthe learners. With CBA in connection to language teaching and learning, learners study language in situations and \ncontexts that are varied and relevant e.g. applying for a job, shopping in a super market and making an offer. This is \nto ensure that learners develop linguistic competence and problem solving abilities that can be used in new and \nchallenging situations in life. This gives meaning to students’ learning and puts them at the centre of the \nteaching/learning transaction. It focuses on what learners are expected to do with language, the focal point being the \noutcomes of teaching. Here, we do not concentrate on the learners’ knowledge of the language but on how they use it \nin real life situations to solve problems and get things done. According to Richards and Roger (2001) the learning \nactivities are real world tasks and may be related to any domain of life.  \nThe four basic language skills are taught in an integrated manner e.g. in teaching listening comprehension, the \nstudents’ are being made to listen, read, write and sp eak. Emphasis is placed on the productive (speaking and \nwriting), interpretive (reading and liste ning) and interactive competences (speaking and writing) while linguistic \n(grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation) and strategic comp etences are seen as supporting competences since they \nare just tools used to achieve an end. The focus is on learners being able to use English to accomplish tasks which are \ncommunicative in nature. This makes it closely linked to communicative language teaching.  \n2.4.1 Components of CBA \nWeddel (2006), outlines CBA components as follows; \n Assessment of learners’ needs: The teacher carries out a needs analysis to ascertain the competencies to be \ndeveloped in learners. \n Selection of the competences: The teacher selects the competencies in accordance to the students’ needs.  \n Target instruction: Since in CBLT the aim is co mmunicative competence in L2, the teacher selects \ninstruction based on the communicative needs of the students. \n Evaluation of the competency attainment: The teacher evaluates the level of competency attainment in the \nstudents to see if it tallies with the stated outcomes. The process continues until competency is attained.  \n2.4.2 Features of CBA \nAccording to Richards and Rogers (2001), the features of CBA are as follows; \n Competencies are stated in specifi c and measurable behavioural terms. Richards and Roger put it as \noutcomes that are made explicit a priori i.e. public knowledge known and agreed upon by the learners and \nteacher. Thus the students clearly know what behaviour and skills are expected of them.  \n Contents are based on the learners’ needs i.e. outcomes . A focus on life skills to be developed in learners. \nHere we have task or performance centred orientation where focus is on what the students can do with \nlanguage and certain behaviours instead of knowledge of the language.  \n The learners continue learning until mastery is demons trated. Richards and Rogers (ibid) say assessment is \nbased on the students’ performance of specific behaviours instead of traditional paper and pen test.  \n The instruction or teaching is paced to the needs of the learners. Richar ds and Rogers (ibid) state that \ninstruction is individualised and student centred. Instru ction is not time based but is centred on the progress \nof the individual students and at their own pace. This implies that, in CBA we hold learning bound and let \ntime vary.  \nhttp://wje.sciedupress.com World Journa l of Education V ol. 6, No. 2; 2016 \nPublished by Sciedu Press                         5 5                           ISSN 1925-0746  E-ISSN 1925-0754  \n Nkwetisama (ibid) states that CBA pr ovides learners with immediate feed back on assessment performance. \nRichards and Roger talk of continuous and on going assessment which implies that students are tested \nbefore teaching to determine the skills  they lack and after teaching to ev aluate their attainment of those \nskills.  \n CBA centres on what learners need to learn; the ap plication of basic skills in life language contexts. \nRichards and Rogers look at it from the point of successful functioning in society which means that \nlanguage is taught in order to prepare the students for the different demands of the worlds.  \n Modularised instruction in which the competences to be taught are systematically separated into \nmanageable parts to ease mastery and progress by both teacher and students.  \n Nkwetisama mentions extensive use of texts, medi a, and real life materials adapted to targeted \ncompetencies.  \n He equally talks of unlimited variety of instructional techniques and group work.  \n2.4.3 Teachers’/Students’ Role in a CBA Framework \nIn CBA, the teacher acts as a facilitator (facilitates learning ), organiser (selects and arranges learning situation) and \nmentor (provides models and monitors students’ learning) to create clear communicative objectives and provides \ncommunicative practices using English that supports lear ners in developing their skills and that focus on how \nstudents will speak, write, read or listen to interact, interpre t, or produce in English language so as to communicate. \nHere, objectives should describe what learners will be ab le to do by a certain time and verbs used to describe \nthis/these should describe something the teacher can see or  hear. E.g. demonstrate, summarize etc. CBA tells the \nteacher what and how to teach. Also, the teacher provides feedback and indi vidualised instruction, (Richards & \nRogers, ibid).  \nThe students’ role is to regularly practice the skills learnt in varied communicative situation and figure out the rules \nand patterns of language, then plan for and use strategies to help them learn and communicate. Learners are to be \nable to adapt and transfer knowledge from one setting to another.  \n \n3. An Appraisal of the CBLT Model in Cameroonian Schools \n3.1 Research Design, Sample and Sampling Techniques, Instruments for Data Collection \nThis study made use of the survey research design. The purposive sampling technique was employed to select a \nsample of 100 English language teachers from 32 secondary schools in the North West and South West regions of \nCameroon. (See the table below) Due the fact that this model was introduced in Cameroonian schools only in 2012, \nwith instructions to start with the form one students only; this study only focussed in the junior secondary levels of \nforms one, two and three. \n \nTable 1.

A. in the teaching of the English language in junior \nsecondary schools. The difficulties identified were: insufficient instructional resources (30.1%), very large class sizes \n(34.9%), insufficient motivation (15.7%), inadequate tr aining (15.7%) and insufficien t time allocated for lesson \n(03.6%).  \n3.2.7 Presentation of Data from Observation of Lessons in Some Schools: \nThe results of observing teachers in ten schools located in the North West and South West regions from the total \nnumber of schools employed (G.B.H.S. LIMBE, SBC. LIMBE G.B.H.S. Mbeunkong, C.C.A.S.T. Bambili, G.B.H.S. \nBamenda, CCAS Kumba, GHS Mamfe, GHS Batoke, BGS Molyko) and included as presented in this section \ninclude: \n In most of the lessons observed, although the teacher used questioning techniques, class participation was \nvery timid. A few students listened and spoke while the majority of them were busy discussing issues that \nwere not related to the lessons.  \n In the majority of the cases, the teacher did not relate  the lesson to real-life situations in order to ease \nstudents’ understanding.  \n Most of the lessons were focused on listening and speaking. This might have been due to the large class size \nof at least 75 students, and the students’ lack of textbooks, which contributed significantly to low class \nparticipation rate.  \nhttp://wje.sciedupress.com World Journa l of Education V ol. 6, No. 2; 2016 \nPublished by Sciedu Press                         6 1                           ISSN 1925-0746  E-ISSN 1925-0754  \n Another observation was the fact that most of th e teachers still stuck to the old method of relying \ncompletely on the course book instead of /adapting th e material in the textbook to teach through real-life \nsituations.  \n In many of the cases, the teacher guided the students at the introductory stage to come out with what was to \nbe learned and when the students could not do so, the teacher ended up telling them everything.  \n Emphasis was laid on the speaking skill to the detriment of the other skills.  \n Most of the students were very passive in class, probably due to the very large class size, which made class \ncontrol ineffective.  \n In some cases, the teacher tried to implement the C.B.A. during the presentation stage of the lesson, through \nquestioning techniques. Th e teacher asked many leading questions; students listened during much of the \nlesson and students’ response was timid. Consequently, the teacher ended up doing much of the talking.  \n \nInterviews \nA total of 39 English language teacher s from the schools selected for this study were interviewed. The responses \nobtained from the teachers interviewed are summarized below: \n Most of them acknowledged that th ey were aware of the C.B.A. as a new approach in the educational \nsystem. However, they confessed that they had a shallow knowledge of what the C.B.A. entails. \nConsequently, they could not apply it effectively in their lessons.  \n A large proportion (more than 75%) of the interviewees  confessed that they had not received any form of \ntraining on the application of the C.B.A. They indicated that they had attended a few seminars in which \ntalks were presented on the C.B.A. However, no practical lesson was taught on the application of the C.B.A. \nin these seminars. Consequently, they were very reluctant to delve into something with which they were not \nfamiliar.  \n Most of those who claimed that they were applying the C.B.A. did so unconsciously and for this reason, the \nbest results could not be attained.  \n In relation to language skills developed, most of those interviewed said that the C.B.A. was aimed at \ndeveloping the speaking and reading skills, leaving out the listening and writing skills, which are equally \nimportant. Therefore, they were of the opinion that the C.B.A. is aimed at developing communicative \ncompetence only.  \n The interviewees named a host of problems encountere d in the implementation of the C.B.A., including the \nfollowing:  \nStudents were not willing to participate in the lessons; for this reason, in the course of helping students to understand \nusing the questioning technique, the teacher ends up talking too much instead of the students doing more of the \ntalking. This leads to another problem-that of insufficient time allocation for lessons.  \nIt is time-consuming to prepare lessons using the C.B.A.  because it needs the use of a lot of resources. They \nindicated that in teaching a lesson on a topic with which th e students were unfamiliar, it became difficult to situate \nand do the teaching as well as paint a picture of the situation.  \nThey also indicated that assembling teaching aids, especially given the very large class sizes, was very difficult. This \nmade it near-impossible to teaching grammar lessons using the C.B.A., with the present state of affairs.  \nVerification of Information from the Responses \nIn this section, the responses provided in this study will be verified by considering the analysis of data collected \nusing the questionnaire, observation and interviews.  \nVerification on Whether Teachers in the Field Are Adequately Prepared to Carry Out the CBA \nThe table below summarizes the analysis  of data from the questionnaire relating to whether teachers are ready to \nimplement the CBA \n \n \nhttp://wje.sc\nPublished by\nTable 17.

Findings \n4.1 Discussion of Findings  \nThe analysis of data collected with re spect to whether teachers in the field were adequately equipped and ready to \nimplement the CBA leads to the conclusion that most teachers (at least 50.7%) in the field are inadequately equipped \nand are not ready to implement the C.B.A. in the teaching and learning of the English language in junior secondary \nschools in the North West and South West Regions of the Republic of Cameroon.  \nAlthough the large majority (i.e. 84.6%) of the respondent s had attended seminars/workshops on the application of \nthe C.B.A. in the teaching and learning of the English language, most (i.e. 82.4 %) of them did not understand what \nthe C.B.A. entails. 57.1% of the respondents from the questionnaire claimed that they had been trained on the \napplication of the C.B.A. However, from interviews conducted with the respondents, it was unfortunate to find that \nthe large majority (about 75%) of them confessed that they did not think they had received sufficient training to \nenable them implement the C.B.A. in English language teaching and learning. From interviews conducted with some \nof the teachers, most of them indicated that much of the work done during the seminars which they had attended was \nvery theoretical, since no practical less ons were taught to demonstrate the app lication of the C.B.A. in the teaching \nand learning of the English language. 74.3% of the respondents declared that they were not confident enough in their \nability to implement the C.B.A. and consequently, they were  not ready to embrace this paradigm shift in English \nlanguage teaching and learning, as confirmed by 82.4% of the respondents.  \n4.1.1 Discussion of Findings for Whether the CBA is Being Effectively Implemented in Teaching and Learning of \nthe English Language \nThe analysis of data collected throu gh the questionnaire, observation and interviews, with respect to the above \nsubject leads to the conclusion that the C.B.A. is not be ing effectively implemented in the teaching and learning of \nthe English language in junior secondary schools in the North West and South West Regions of the Republic of \nCameroon.  \nFrom the questionnaire, although about 50.6% of the teachers claimed that they prepared their lessons with C.B.A. in \nfocus, only 47.3% indicated that they incorporated the C.B.A. in at least half of their lessons.  \nData analysed from the questionnaires showed that 85.7% of the respondents claimed that they aimed at developing \nall four language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) in their teachin g. However, most of those observed \nand interviewed (about 72%) confessed that their teaching focuse d more on the listening and speaking skills, with \nvery little emphasis on the reading and writing skills, in disagreement with the information from the questionnaires. \nMoreover, about 77% of the respondents indicated that they had not been preparing their lessons with a focus on the \nC.B.A., again sharply contrasting the information obtained  from the questionnaire. In addition, the proportion of \nrespondents who incorporated the C.B.A. in at least 50% of their lessons was found to be about 29%, much smaller \nthan that obtained using the questionnaires (i.e. 47.3%). \nFinally, it was found out that only 12.09% of the respondent s indicated that they were effectively implementing the \nC.B.A. in English language teaching and learning in second ary school, while the large ma jority (87.9%) shared the \nopinion that they were ineffective, as far as the impl ementation of the C.B.A. in English language teaching and \nlearning is concerned.  \n4.1.2 Discussion of Findings  of Whether Teachers in the Field Encoun ter Significant Difficu lties in Implementing \nthe CBA \nFrom the analysis of data collected in  relation to the above subject, it was fo und that all the teachers in the field \nshared the opinion that they  faced significant diff iculties in the implementation of the C.B.A. in the Republic of \nCameroon. The following problems were identified to be par ticularly serious: inadequate instructional resources \n(indicated by 30.1% of the responses); lack of adequate training  (indicated by 15.7% of the responses); very large \nclass sizes (revealed in 34.9% of the responses); insuffic ient motivation (shared by 15.7% of the responses) and \nothers, such as insufficient time allocated for English language lessons (indicated by 03.6% of the responses).  \nSummarily, it can be deducted from the discussion above th at teachers in the field are not adequately equipped and \nare not yet ready to implement the C.B. A. in English language teaching and learning due to a number of difficulties. \nhttp://wje.sciedupress.com World Journa l of Education V ol. 6, No. 2; 2016 \nPublished by Sciedu Press                         6 5                           ISSN 1925-0746  E-ISSN 1925-0754  \nConsequently, the C.B.A. is not being effectively implemented in the teaching and learning of the English language \nin junior secondary in the North West and South West Regions of the Republic of Cameroon.  \n4.2 Pedagogic Relevance of the Study \nThis study is very significant as far as pedagogy is concerned. The state of Cameroon has adopted the C.B.A. as the \napproach that should be used in all secondary schools in the country. This study provides the authorities in the \nMinistry of Secondary Education with information about the situation in the field, as far as the implementation of the \nC.B.A. in concerned. Through this study, they would know that the training of teachers in the field as well as their \nequipment, is inadequate and consequently they cannot implement the C.B.A. in the teaching and learning of the \nEnglish language in secondary schools considering the present state of affairs.  \n \n5. Recommendations \nIn view of the findings of this study, recommendations shall be made to the following group of people: \n5.1 Authorities in the Ministry of Secondary Education in Yaoundé \nThis ministry is responsible for restructuring the school curriculum, so as to incorporate the C.B.A. as well as \nensuring that the C.B.A. is effec tively implemented in the teaching/lear ning process in secondary schools. \nUnfortunately, the prevailing situation suggest that “the cart has been put before the horse”, in the sense that teachers \nin the field are expected to implement the C.B.A. whereas they have not been prepared for this assignment by way of \nadequate training and equipment with the necessary instructional resources.  \nThese authorities should know that teachers already in service in the field need to be trained and equipped in order to \nmake them fit and confident in implem enting the C.B.A. in the teaching-learning process. They should therefore \nidentify countries in which the C.B.A. has been implemente d successfully and learn from the experts the strategies \nemployed. Then they could borrow the knowledge which would be transmitted to other teachers at home. In this way, \nall teachers in the field would eventually be well trai ned and amply equipped to implement the C.B.A. in the \nteaching and learning of the English language in secondary schools in Cameroon.  \nThe implementation of the C.B.A. is very challenging and very demanding too. Consequently, the Ministry of \nSecondary Education should do all in th eir power, to improve on the working conditions of teachers, so that they \nwould be motivated to do their work well, including the implementation of the C.B.A. in the teaching/learning \nprocess.  \n5.2 Authorities of the Higher Teacher Training Colleges \nThey should redesign their training programmes to incorporate the C.B.A. In this way, trainees who graduate from \nthese institutions in charge of teacher training would be grounded in the application of the C.B.A. in the \nteaching/learning process, by the end of  their training. Once in the field, they would go ahead to implement the \nC.B.A. in their teaching effectively.  \nConsidering the fact that a good nu mber of secondary schools in the North West and South West Regions in \nparticular and Cameroon in general do not have sufficient number of English language teachers, the authorities of the \nHigher Teacher Training Colleges should do everything possi ble to convince the Government to increase the intake \nof students into their institutions, especially in the departments of English Modern Letters.  \nFinally, there are indications that most of the students who are recruited to be trained in the department of English \nmodern letters end up specializing in teaching literature in  English. In order to solve this problem, a separate \ndepartment should be created for English language alone, so that all students trained in this department would teach \nthe English language upon graduation.  \n5.3 Regional Pedagogic Inspectors \nThey should organize in-service training seminars on a regular basis, on the C.B.A. and its application in the \nteaching/learning process. These seminars should be decentralized so that they  take place at regional, divisional and \nsub-divisional levels. In this way, all teachers in the fiel d would be involved in the in-service training programmes. \nMoreover, during such seminars, concrete lessons sh owing how the C.B.A. should be applied in the \nteaching/learning process should be taught to participan ts, by experts in this domain . In this way, the effective \nimplementation of the C.B.A. in the teaching of the English language in secondary schools would be guaranteed. \n5.4 Principals of Secondary Schools \nOne of the problems hampering the impl ementation of the C.B.A. in  the teaching of the Eng lish language in junior \nhttp://wje.sciedupress.com World Journa l of Education V ol. 6, No. 2; 2016 \nPublished by Sciedu Press                         6 6                           ISSN 1925-0746  E-ISSN 1925-0754  \nsecondary schools lies in the fact that ma ny of the classes are very large, in terms of the number of students. There \nare cases in which a teacher has to teach four or five stre ams of students, each numbering at least eighty. Clearly, the \nimplementation of the C.B.A. in this case is near-impossible.  \nIn order to solve this problem, principals of secondary schools should respect the Ministerial prescription of sixty \nstudents per class, so as to avoid overcrowding and redu ce the students-teacher ratio to  a manageable level. This \nwould improve a student-teacher interaction, give more room for feedback to be given to students and make the \nteacher’s role as a facilitator in the C.B.A. more practicable. \n5.5 Parents of Learners  \nIn order for students to benefit from the C.B.A., they must be ready to do research on their own, with the teacher \nplaying the role of facilitator, organizer, prompter, contro ller, counsellor, adviser, director and supervisor. This \nobviously implies that the learner has a very important role  to play and places demands in the domains of books and \nother resources necessary for individual student research. Pa rents are therefore called upon to provide the resources \nwhich their children need, so that they can benefit fully from the C.B.A.  \n \n6. Conclusion \nFrom this study it is important to reiterate the fact that there is no single model which could be looked upon as the \none ideal model to be employed for the teaching and learning of English language. As demonstrated from findings in \nthis study and according to Ur  (1996) ‘no single method is optimally eff ective for teaching languages.’ It seems we \nhave learned enough from past experiences and research so as to practice a cautious eclecticism or integrated \napproach, where, as Swan (1985b:87) puts it we both try out new techniques and hold on the useful older ones. We \nhave come to realize, in Stern’s (1983:474) words, that ‘language teaching cannot be satisfactorily conceptualized in \nterms of teaching method alone.’ And a majority of language specialists consider eclecticism a legitimate solution to \nthe lack of universal solutions offered by any single method or, as Rodgers (2001:4) terms it, ‘method synergistics’ \nor a ‘disciplined eclecticism’. Thus it could be concluded that  it is impossible to arrive at  the perfect approach or a \ntechnique for language learning in any context. Language learning is such a complex process that it is impossible to \noffer a single solution to all our problems. Perhaps the best method is the one which works, and this varies from \ncontext to context. Any method which creates conditions for learning to take  place is good. It should enable the \nlearner to acquire the strategies of learning rather than merely equipping him with knowledge. What is important for \nthe teacher, therefore, is to find ou t what approach and what method will en able him/her to realize a particular \nobjective under a set of particular circumstances. \n \nReferences \nAllen, H.
