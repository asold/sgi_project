  "abstract": "Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) is an important tool used for diagnostic measurements of power transformers. Standard test configuration applied in the industry is the end-to-end open test setup; however, an interwinding capacitive configuration is also used. This paper presents a method—Cross Test Comparison (CTC)—for simultaneous analysis of results coming from both the mentioned test setups. Such an approach could offer a more sensitive tool for detecting some faults; moreover, it takes into consideration the influence of both voltage sides of a transformer in a one test result. The authors have used several indices to quantitatively assess the test results and proposed new approach to data interpretation. CTC method was tested using data from measurements performed in three cases: a unit tested in laboratory with introduced controlled deformations; transformers measured under industrial conditions; and a transformer with FRA changes resulting from tap-changer operations. The results showed that CTC method is more effective at detecting faults on the basis of FRA measurements.",
