  "abstract": "A substation is a part of an electrical generation, transmission, and distribution system.Substations generally have switching, protection and control equipment, and transformers.The low voltage distribution networks are supplied from MV/LV substation transformer that represent the last step of bringing transformation to the low voltage and ensuring the protection and monitoring of the network.There are three types of MV/LV substation: pole-mounted transformer substation, the substation in an envelope and substation in masonry.This paper presents a general description for different MV/LV substation and a methodology to design the various elements making up the public distribution substation (choice of the emplacement, engineering, power transformer, choice of MV cells, circuit breakers, fuses, disconnect switch, conductors,...etc).",
